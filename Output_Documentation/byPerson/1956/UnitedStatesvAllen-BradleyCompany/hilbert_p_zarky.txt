mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
and
the
next
succeeding
case
are
both
tax
cases
and
they
both
involve
a
common
ultimate
question.
and
that
question
is
simply
this,
whether
this
taxpayers
who
receive
so
called
certificates
of
necessity
with
respect
to
certain
property,
and
whether
the
certifying
officials
in
issuing
the
certificate
limited
it
to
a
percentage
less
than
100%
of
the
cost
of
the
property.
whether
under
those
circumstances,
the
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
a
tax
deduction
based
on
100%
of
the
cost
of
the
property
as
the
court
of
claims
held
in
this
case
or
whether
as
the
government
contends,
the
taxpayer's
deduction
must
be
limited
to
the
percentage
of
cost
which
these
certifying
officials
in
the
certificate
found
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
our
position
is
to
hold
our
first
contention,
our
first
argument
is
that
the
statutory
authority
which
congress
granted,
the
discretion
did
entrust
to
--
to
these
officials
was
sufficiently
broad.
so
that
they
could,
as
they
did
in
this
case
and
then
the
other
cases,
issue
certificates
of
necessity
limited
to
some
percentage,
some
portion
of
the
cost
less
than
100%.
now,
of
course,
if
the
court
agrees
with
that
contention
of
ours,
that
ends
the
case.
we
have,
moreover,
a
--
an
alternative
argument,
that
is,
if
the
court
should
disagree,
if
it
should
hold
that
the
statute
was
not
sufficiently
broad
to
permit
these
partial
certificates.
in
other
words
if
congress
didn't
require
the
administrative
officials
in
determining
what
was
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
to
answer
that
question
yes
or
no,
and
nowhere
in
between,
we
say
that
nonetheless,
the
taxpayers
are
not
entitled
to
prevail
for
this
reason.
that,
having
accepted
these
certificates,
some
10
years
ago,
without
any
challenge,
without
any
attempt
to
litigate
in
the
courts
the
question
whether
the
certificates
were
authorized
by
the
statute
or
not,
having
in
fact
treated
in
their
tax
returns.
the
certificate's
as
valid
because
they
took
the
tax
deductions
just
as
we
say
they
should.
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
taxpayers
cannot,
in
a
tax
proceeding
before
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
or
in
the
tax
court
in
the
next
case,
obtain
deductions
on
100%
of
the
property
for
these
reasons.
namely,
their
right
to
a
deduction
of
100%,
even
if
the
administrative
officials
had
answered
these
100%
or
0%
were
dependent
upon
having
certificates
that
100%
of
the
cost
of
property
was
necessary
indeed
because
of
the
national
defense.
this,
of
course,
the
administrative
officials
did
not
do.
and
we
may
obtain
in
our
second
proposition
that
neither
the
court
of
claims
nor
the
tax
court,
in
this
tax
proceeding,
could
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
administrative
officials.
it
could
not
--
it
could
itself
determine
that
these
facilities
were
in
their
entirety
for
100%
of
their
cause
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
and
grant
deduction
just
as
though
certificates
of
that
kind
had
been
issued.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
answered
the
question
which
i
was
just
now
describing,
namely,
that
they
were
saying
as
i
understand
the
opinion
below
that
the
tax
court
couldn't
itself
exercise
the
discretion
entrusted
to
the
administrators.
the
tax
court
could
not
decide
that
these
facilities
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
for
100%
of
the
cause.
let
me
expostulate
and
i'll
get
back
to
that
my
second
point
later.
for
example,
if
the
taxpayers
immediately
upon
being
issued
the
certificates
had
gone
into
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
and
said,
"this
is
wrong.congress
hasn't
authorized
you
to
do
this."
we
believe,
a
district
court
properly
could
have
done
no
more,
had
it
agreed
that
that
was
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
statute.
then
to
send
the
matter
back
to
the
certifying
officials
and
say,
use
your
discretion
within
the
limit
set
--
set
forth
by
congress.
but
it
would
not
itself
have
said,
mr.
taxpayer,
you
are
entitled
to
100%
certificate,
and
we
of
the
district
court,
i
will
decide
that
that's
a
certificate
you
are
entitled
to
and
i
will
mandamus
the
official
to
issue
it.
and
as
i
read
the
second
circuit's
opinion,
what
it
said
was
--
which
is
our
position
namely,
you
don't
have
100%
certificate,
the
tax
court
couldn't
issue
you
one,
the
tax
court
couldn't
exercise
that
discretion
and
therefore,
the
tax
court
is
wrong
in
granting
you
relief
as
though
you
had
100%
certificate.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
either
way,
if
you
decide
that
they
had
statutory
authority,
you
don't
reach
this
question.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
you
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
decide
that
in
this
question,
you
don't
have
to
decide
whether
they
have
the
statutory
authority.
we
believe
the
statutory
--
the
bullet
points
are
very
clear.
and
logically,
we
start
with
the
proposition
what
they
did
was
correct.
what
they
did
was
lawful.
what
they
did
was
within
what
congress
gave
them
the
power
to
do,
and
that's
the
proposition
i
would
like
to
argue
first
and
then,
argue
the
second
proposition
namely
that
in
any
event,
the
tax
court
or
the
court
of
claims
couldn't
do
what
they
did
in
these
cases.
do
i
--
i
make
our
ultimate
position
clear?
i
have
--
don't
want
to
elaborate
at
this
point,
but
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
it's
--
it's
still
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
difficult
because
in
the
first
case
if
your
honors
decide
that
this
was
a
statutory
authority,
it
seems
to
me,
it
ends
both
cases
because
the
taxpayers
would.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
we
make
both
arguments
in
both
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
as
a
preliminary
matter
with
the
court's
indulgence
before
i
get
to
discussing
these
precise
legal
issues,
i
think
that
what's
involved
may
become
clearer
or
be
seen
in
--
in
its
proper
light
or
perspective
if
i
were
to
first
briefly
sketch
the
problem
as
it
existed
out
of
which
these
cases
arrive.
as
i
said
they're
tax
questions
but,
unlike
most
tax
questions,
the
major
context
out
of
which
they
arise
are
not
tax
problems.
i
must
take
your
honors
back
to
the
period
of
1940,
when
the
situation
in
europe
was
such
that,
i
need
scarcely
remind
the
court
what
it
was.
this
country
was
engaged
in
embarking
on
a
tremendous
defense
program.
what
was
needed
was
a
great
expansion
in
our
plant
facilities
capable
of
producing
the
--
all
the
items
which
we
were
then
intent
to
finally
sending
to
what
would
eventually
become
our
allies
and
then
producing
the
things
that
we
ourselves
would
need
shortly
when
we
became
engaged
in
a
war.
the
problem
confronting
congress,
the
administration
on
that
point
in
achieving
as
fast
expansion
that
was
needed
in
plant
capacity
was
to
encourage
for
the
most
part
private
capital
to
construct
these
facilities.
private
capital
was
reluctant
at
that
time
because
well,
they
and
the
treasury
were
convinced
that
existing
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
law
were
not
sufficient
to
safeguard
the
tax
problems
that
might
arise
in
other
words,
that
the
manufacturer
were
asked
to
produce
--
to
build
a
plant
capable
of
producing
more
facilities.
he
might
in
a
short
period
of
time
find
if
the
war
was
over,
the
plant
was
useless.
and
there
was
no
assurance
that
his
tax
deductions
during
the
time
when
the
facilities
were
being
used
and
that
prior
to
being
created
would
be
sufficient
to
safeguard
his
interest.
and
the
proposal
put
to
congress
was
the
amortization
program
which
--
out
of
which
these
cases
arise.
this
amortization
program
was
proposed
to
congress
on
the
second
revenue
act
of
1940,
when
the
first
excess
profit
tax
simultaneously
being
proposed.
and
that,
of
course,
made
the
problem
even
more
urgent
because
of
the
high
tax
rates
that
were
going
to
be
imposed
upon
corporations.
in
that
--
from
the
hearings,
in
legislative
history,
that
second
revenue
act
of
1940,
these
amortization
features
which
i
will
describe
to
you
were
proposed.
and
the
same
time,
congress
was
told
that
the
government,
of
course,
would
be
unable
to
rely
completely
upon
private
capital
that
a
large
amount
of
the
plant
expansion
would
have
to
come
from
government
financing.
this
would
take
several
forms.
either
a
government
--
we
build
plants
with
government
funds
operated
by
government
personnel,
or
a
government
--
the
built
plant
which
would
be
leased
to
a
private
manufacture
at
an
annual
basis.
or
another
avenue
was
the
so-called
defense
plant
facilities
contracts
under
which
we
advanced
the
money
to
the
contractor,
deeds
of
legal
title
to
the
plant
that
was
built
but
the
beneficial
use
was
in
the
united
states.
so
that
real
ownership
was
in
the
united
states.
so,
what
congress
saw
in
the
type
of
program
where
the
government
financing
under
several
ways
of
encouraging
private
financing
under
a
scheme
which
would
mean
really
with
the
indirect
government
financing
because
it
would
be
at
the
sacrifice
of
revenue
which
might
otherwise
be
collected.
the
amortization
program
--
the
amortization
provisions
were
nothing
more
than
accelerated
depreciation.
what
congress
did
was
to
tell
the
taxpayer
if
you
obtain
a
certificate
from
proper
officials
that
the
plant
or
a
portion
of
it
is
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense,
we
will
give
you
absolute
assurance
that
those
certified
cause
can
be
deducted
by
you
against
your
income
during
a
period
of
no
more
than
five
years.
or
that
was
the
other
limits,
at
higher
cost
to
be
written
off
during
that
period.
the
period
could
also
be
shorter.
in
other
words,
if
the
emergency
were
to
terminate
sooner
than
five
years,
you
could
squeeze
the
deductions
and
cover
it
right
off
the
whole
cost
within
a
shorter
period,
one
year
or
two
years
depending
upon
when
the
plants
were
constructed
and
when
the
emergency
terminated.
so
that
when
i
use
the
term
amortization
as
a
statute,
that's
what
we're
talking
about
really,
is
accelerated
depreciation.
depreciation
would
still
be
a
problem
as
it
is
on
these
cases
and
other
cases
where
only
part
of
the
cost
were
subject
to
amortization.
in
other
words,
you
like
to
get
part
of
your
cost
within
the
five-year
period
or
less
and
the
rest
of
the
cost
would
be
spread
over
the
normal
period
for
depreciation,
whatever
the
useful
life
of
the
property
was
10,
15,
20
years.
so
that
ultimately,
you
got
your
whole
cost
back
in
tax
deduction
but
the
real
question
was
how
much
would
you
get
back
rapidly
during
a
period
when
it
was
expected
that
tax
rates
would
be
abnormally
high.
and
it
was
in
this
background
that
congress
enacted
the
second
revenue
act
of
1940
adopted
the
excess
profits
tax
ended
up
with
the
amortization
provisions
of
which
we
deal.
during
the
early
period
of
the
--
of
its
administration,
these
certificates
were
being
issued
by
the
secretaries
of
war
and
navy
under
regulations
which
they
prescribed
by
the
approval
of
the
president.
and
so
far
as
the
history
shows,
for
the
most
part,
those
certificates
were
issued
for
100%,
although,
there
is
indication
that
partial
certificates
were
issued
on
occasion
when
the
circumstances
warranted.
now,
the
problem
of
this
case
arise
from
the
fact
that
by
1943
--
the
middle
of
1943,
the
administration
had
become
convinced
that
the
picture
had
completely
changed.
while
we
still
did
not
have
all
the
tools
we
needed
for
war,
we
did
have
the
plant
we
needed.
and
that
thereafter,
the
problem
was
one
of
utilizing
those
plants,
taking
whatever
resource
that
we
had
available
to
funnel
through
the
plant
--
plants
to
get
the
production
of
materials.
and
at
that
point,
it
was
first
suggested
that
the
amortization
provisions
be
dropped
altogether.
that
it
was
decided,
however,
not
to
do
that.
it
was
decided
that
certificates
would
still
be
issued
but
very
limitedly.
in
the
fall
of
1943,
under
an
executive
order,
the
certifying
officials
were
explicitly
warned
that
thereafter
or
guided
that
thereafter,
certificates
would
not
be
increased
and
issued
unless
it
was
in
the
interest
--
the
financial
interest
of
the
government.
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
functions
were
transferred
to
the
war
production
board
and
it
issued
its
regulations
and
detailed
instructions
to
its
personnel.
and
this
is
important
i
think
to
the
court
because
there's
a
tremendous
difference
between
how
we
view
this
case
and
what
was
done
with
these
certificates
and
the
view
taken
by
the
tax
court,
the
court
of
claims
and
the
taxpayers.
and
so,
i
want
to
emphasize
what
went
on
with
regard
to
instructions,
the
program
of
the
wpb
that
led
to
the
issuance
of
these
partial
certificates.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no
change
made
in
the
statute.
they
envisaged
that
the
statute
had
already
authorized
it
and
this
is
what
the
first
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
regulations
are
not
explicit
on
this
part
that
--
that
i'm
speaking
of
although
they
do
say
that
the
financial
interest
of
the
government
must
be
safeguarded
and
during
this
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
national
lead
--
in
the
allen-bradley
case,
the
record
shows
only
a
partial
quotation
from
one
of
the
certificates
but
they're
all
fairly
typical
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
full
tax
is
the
national
lead
records
your
honor,
you'll
find
those
on
--
beginning
on
pages
84
and
85
--
i'm
sorry,
that's
8
(a)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
and
8
(b).
they're
for
the
stats
in
the
national
lead
record
showing
they're
tax
certificates
and
i
need
to
discuss
those
in
--
in
a
moment,
your
honor.
but
these
instructions
which
i
refer
to,
you'll
find
in
appendix,
brief
b
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
allen-bradley
case
and
they're
also
in
the
record
in
the
national
lead
case.
they
begin
on
pages
44
of
the
appendix
b
in
the
allen-bradley
case.
now,
the
war
production
board
at
that
time
set
forth
the
size
standard.
in
other
words,
it
made
a
general
determination
of
what
it
would
do
and
what
it
would
not
do
in
the
future.
it
said
that
in
view
of
the
financial
interests
of
the
government,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
government,
all
we
had
is
an
alternative.
its
ability
to
finance
the
plant
itself
and
capture
any
utility
that
these
plants
might
have
after
the
war
that
in
view
of
those
two
things
that
thereafter,
certificates
for
100%
of
the
cost
would
only
be
issued
in
cases
where
it
was
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
facilities
would
not
be
useful
after
the
war.
in
other
words,
their
utility
would
be
exhausted
when
the
emergency
was
--
was
ended.
it
said
that
where
facilities
were
proposed
which
would
appear
reasonably
to
have
possibility
that
calls
for
a
use,
it
would
be
in
the
interest
--
the
financial
interest
of
the
government
to
have
those
facilities
financed
by
the
government
so
that
on
the
end
of
the
--
the
emergency,
the
government
could
capture
whatever
cost
for
a
utility
would
be
in
such
facilities.
and
that
in
view
of
the
cost
to
the
government,
in
a
way
of
lost
revenue
in
issuing
100%
certificates
where
facilities
would
have
opposed
for
a
use,
it
would
not
be
to
the
interest
of
the
government
or
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
to
issue
certificate
of
those
kind
--
of
that
kind.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
it
was
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
by
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no.
well,
a
press
release
was
issued
at
the
time
that
the
executive
order
which
announced
that
the
amortization
privilege
had
virtually
been
terminated.
but
the
particular
matters
i
am
speaking
of
were
made
manifest
within
the
war
production
board
by
way
of
a
memorandum
and
the
structure
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
internal.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
whether
they
did
or
did
not,
i'm
not
sure,
justice
frankfurter,
but
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
took
place
in
the
latter
part
of
1943
--
already
part
of
1944.
this
appears
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
preceding
that
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
for
the
most
part
in
these
cases.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
that
one
certificate
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
one
claim
--
one
certificate
i
believe
in
allen-bradley
was
issued
by
the
secretary
of
war
or
navy
before
this,
although,
there
are
regulations
too
which
were
public
and
published
in
the
federal
register
said
that
certificates
will
not
be
issued
unless
was
determined
in
advance
that
the
--
that
financial
advantage
of
the
government
would
be
preserved.
those
particular
instructions
that
are
--
in
this
appendix
b
through
our
allen-bradley
brief
we're
getting
on
page
44.
so
that
before
a
certificate
would
be
issued
and
the
whole
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
is
our
--
do
you
have
appendix
b,
justice
reed?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
those
are
--
in
that
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
the
memorandum
of
recommendations
and
then
beginning
on
47,
are
instructions
for
the
personnel
with
particular
questions
which
had
to
the
answered
before
a
certificate
could
be
recommended.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no.
but
in
this
point
the
war
production
board
made
along
was
to
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
make
the
recommendations
to
its
personnel
and
ultimately
by
the
chairman.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
had
been
much
earlier.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes,
that
there
is
one
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
that
had
gone
out
by
1942
or
1943.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
right
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
emphasize
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
beginning
with
the
december
of
1943,
all
the
processing
was
by
war
production
board.
there
is
an
interim
period
between
october
and
december
when
it
was
shared
by
the
secretary
of
war,
navy
and
war
production
board.
and
one
of
the
certificates
in
allen-bradley
was
one
of
those
interim
ones
issued
by
the
secretary
of
war
during
the
period
transition.
i
mention
and
emphasize
this,
your
honors,
only
because
there's
such
a
great
difference
between
the
view
that
the
court
of
claims
and
the
tax
court
on
the
hand,
in
fact
there's
included
in
--
in
the
government.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
claims
said
this
certificate
recertified
two
things.
one
it
said
that
--
that
the
facilities
are
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
period
and
then
we
put
a
little
limitation
on
it.
what
i
propose
to
argue
is
that
the
matters
i
just
emphasized
indicated
that
they
were
not
making
a
determination.
this
is
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
regardless
of
the
government's
financial
state
but
they
were
saying
up
to
this
point
is
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
beyond
that
point,
it
may
not
be,
it
may
be.
i
don't
know.
they
never
answered
that
question.
but
all
we
know
is
that
up
to
this
point
is
the
only
thing
that
the
war
production
board
had
determined
was
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
don't
mean
to
ban
the
words
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
these
physical
facilities
presumably
were
necessary
for
the
war
(inaudible)
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
but
it
was
not
necessarily
entering
interest
of
the
national
defense
that
they
be
built
by
this
taxpayer,
this
individual
at
the
government's
expense
of
full
amortization
when
the
government
itself
could
have
had
the
same
facilities
had
it
financed
it
and
had
it
had
ownership
which
it
could
exploit
after
the
emergency
was
over.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
it
said
so
much
of
the
cost.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes
and
as
i
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
--
that
part
of
the
shooting,
we
say
that
it
--
it's
really
saying
the
same
thing.
what
they
were
saying
was
we
don't
want
plant
x
if
it's
built
by
taxpayer
z.
if
it's
going
to
have
to
cost
the
government
100%
of
its
cost
as
a
tax
deduction
at
excess
profit
tax
rates
within
maybe
a
year
or
two
when
at
the
same
time,
defense
plant
corporation,
rfc
or
treasury
itself
could
build
these
plants
and
if
the
war
ends
tomorrow,
or
next
month,
the
next
year,
the
government's
got
whatever
value
is
left
in
these.
so
that
between
these
two
alternatives,
we
say
we'll
choose
this
particular
middle
role.
mr.
taxpayer,
you
may
if
you
would
desire
construct
these
facilities
at
this
cost
but
no
more
to
the
government
in
a
way
of
loss
revenues
and
that
will
be
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
but
if
you
--
if
it's
more,
then
that
may
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
a
quotation
from
part
of
one
certificate
is
in
the
record
but
the
rest
were
all
about
the
same.
this
is
on
page
7
of
the
record
in
allen-bradley.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
oh,
i
--
i
think
there
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
one
case
where
mandamus
was
sought
in
the
district
of
columbia.
judge
pine
refused
the
issue
of
the
writ
saying
that
he
had
thought
the
statute
was
not
at
the
taxpayer's
view
that
mainly
limiting
their
authority
to
issue
parts
of
certificates
and
that
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
per
curiam
with
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
miller.
but
let's
assume
for
example
that
judge
pine
takes
an
opposite
view
and
said,
"no,
this
statute
does
preclude
you
from
issuing
certificates
for
35%."
you
must
issue
a
certificate
for
100%
or
you
must
issue
a
certificate
for
--
no,
or
refuse
a
certificate.
had
he
viewed
the
statute
that
way,
i
believe
that
the
proper
decision
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
for
example
in
idaho
power
or
in
(inaudible)
would
have
been
to
remand
the
case
to
the
administrator
and
say,
"here's
the
problem.
it's
your
problem."
we
interpret
the
statute
this
way.now,
you
exercise
your
discretion
in
the
light
of
the
standard
we
have
told
you.
now,
had
these
certificates
been
then
sent
back
to
the
administrator
and
they
had
reexamined
it
they
might
well
have
said,
we
won't
issue
any
certificate.
if
we
have
to
issue
100%
certificate
and
have
it
cost
the
government
maybe
x
dollars
in
possible
lost
revenue.
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
that
the
government
supply
these
facilities
and
we
capture
the
post
for
use
and
that's
our
second
point
namely,
that
at
this
point,
all
that's
gone.
that's
no
longer
possible
and
certainly
not
possible
in
this
tax
proceeding.
shall
i
read
the
certificate
justice
reed?
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
now,
i
may
say
that
all
the
certificates
from
the
very
beginning,
justice
reed,
where
in
the
language
of
this
certificate
except
that
where
it
was
100%,
it
would
have
read,
it
is
hereby
certified
that
the
facility
described
in
the
attached
application
as
the
one
submitted
by
the
taxpayer
are
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
defense
during
the
emergency
period
up
to,
in
this
case
just
35%.
from
the
very
beginning,
it
may
have
set
100%
of
cost
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
not
in
this
case,
sir
but
in
other
cases,
it
did.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
the
court
please,
in
my
remaining
time
--
no
authority
which
we
say
exist
for
these
partial
certificates.
on
pages
--
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
60
and
61
of
our
brief
in
allen-bradley,
appears
in
section
124
(f)
which
is
the
crucial
section
--
this
interpretation
we
disagree
with
on
the
court
of
claims.
that
section
is
entitled,
“determination
of
adjusted
basis
of
emergency
facilities,”
and
says
this,
“in
determining,
for
the
purposes
of
subsection
(a),”
which
is
the
basic
definition,
“the
adjusted
basis
of
an
emergency
facility,”
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
take
your
tax
amortization.
“one,
there
shall
be
included
only
so
much
of
the
amount
otherwise
constituting
such
adjusted
basis.”
as
it's
properly
attributable
to
such
construction,
reconstruction,
erection,
installation
or
acquisition
after
december
31,
1939,
as
either
the
secretary
of
war
or
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
and
that
now
includes
the
wpb
by
transfer,
has
certified
as
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
defense
during
the
emergency
period.
and
the
statute
goes
on
to
say,
“it
should
be
under
regulations
approved
by
the
president.”
now,
we
scarcely
offer
this
section
as
a
model
of
legislative
draftsmanship.
it
is
not
the
clearest
choice
of
language
in
the
world,
but
we
believe
that
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
hope
to
elaborate
on
it
(voice
overlap)
--
