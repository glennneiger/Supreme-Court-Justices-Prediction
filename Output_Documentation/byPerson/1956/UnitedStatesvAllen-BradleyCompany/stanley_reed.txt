justice
stanley
reed
i'm
not
talking
of
44
and
what
--
what
is
it
there?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
i
see
a
memorandum
on
one
of
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
did
i
--
as
i
understand
correctly
that
there
--
there's
no
certificate
in
the
allen-bradley
case
in
the
record?
justice
stanley
reed
suppose
that
he
has
the
guts
to
(inaudible)
--
35%
and
he
wanted
100%.
could
he
get
any
review
of
that
at
that
time?
was
there
any
way
of
contesting
it
at
that
time?
justice
stanley
reed
no.
i
see
it
there
now.
i
just
want
to
get
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
but
what
--
i
don't
quite
grasp
your
point
that
the
government
had
filed
the
--
the
petition,
had
it?
and
you
--
you
had
filed
the
man
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
did
--
did
i
understand
that
they
never
gave
a
100%
certificate
to
anybody?
i
--
i've
got
the
contrary
impression
from
the
government's
argument.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
well,
before
1943?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
why
did
they
put
the
100%
in?
justice
stanley
reed
but
why
would
they
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
give
you
a
dollar?
justice
stanley
reed
it
cost
a
billion
dollars?
justice
stanley
reed
so,
they
--
they
phrased
it
in
percentage
because
they
didn't
know
what
the
cost
is
going
to
be?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
was
thinking
in
the
whole
--
during
the
whole
period.
justice
stanley
reed
they
never
knew
what
the
actual
cost
is
going
to
be
and
perhaps
for
years
after
they
gave
you
the
certificate.
justice
stanley
reed
did
you
ever
got
a
dollar
certificate
from
him?
this
is
the
only
thing
you've
ever
got.
justice
stanley
reed
and
from
your
own
accounts,
you
determined
what
the
cost
was?
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand.
and
--
and
subject
to
verification
and
then
you'd
--
if
you
had
a
--
what
--
what
is
the
limit,
20%
deduction
per
year?
justice
stanley
reed
five
years.
well
that
would
be
20
--
justice
stanley
reed
you
have
100%,
you'd
take
off
20?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
may
i
ask,
did
you
ever
get
any
suggestion
when
this
change
was
made
from
100%
to
the
--
less
than
100%
--
justice
stanley
reed
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
commissioner
had
any
authority
to
determine
whether
they
were
appreciable
or
not,
assuming
that
they
had
lived
up
to
the
certificate.
