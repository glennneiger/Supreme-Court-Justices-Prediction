well,
is
that
because
of
the
first
instance,
the
recommendations
were
to
be
made
but
it
terminates.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
had
there
been
a
history
under
these
recommendations
by
the
chairman
agencies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
one
at
that
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
war
production
board
was
making
its
own
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
another
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
all
the
processing
then
within
the
war
production
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
because
--
because
it
was
merely
an
estimate,
they
gave
you
the
certificate
when
you
began
your
work
--
before
you
began
your
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
there'd
be
tax
effect
as
a
consequence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
they
say
anything?
my
--
my
question
is,
was
there
any
suggestion
that
that
was
going
to
make
a
tax
difference,
a
difference
in
treatment
for
tax
purposes?
when
did
you
first
learn
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
still
don't
quite
understand
when
it
was
you
first
appreciated
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
about
the
time
before
the
construction
was
done
or
any
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
had
an
idea
then
that
there
might
be
a
different
tax
consequences.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
did
nothing,
i
gather,
until
that
time.
