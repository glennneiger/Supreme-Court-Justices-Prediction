mr.
harvey
w.
peters
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
as
much
as
the
government
is
here
requesting
whether
determination
and
judgment
granted
the
allen-bradley
company
by
the
court
of
claims
be
reversed,
i
think
it
proper
that
we
consider
exactly
what
was
before
the
court
of
claims
in
the
case
there.
reading
from
the
record,
page
4,
paragraph
(c)
of
the
allen-bradley
company
petition
states,
"in
connection
with
such
expansion
and
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
124
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
the
plaintiff
filed
for
and
was
issued
nine
necessity
certificates.
in
each
and
every
instance,
the
duly
designated
certifying
authority
determined
that
the
facilities
described
in
the
plaintiff's
application
for
a
necessity
certificate
were
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
defense.
however,
in
three
instances,
the
duly
designated
certifying
authority
certified
less
than
100%
of
the
cost
of
the
facilities
described
in
and
covered
by
the
necessity
certificate
as
amortizable
under
section
124
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
in
other
words,
in
our
petition,
we
pleaded
the
fact
that
these
facilities
in
every
case
had
been
determined
to
be
necessary
for
national
defense.
we
pleaded
also
that
the
duly
designated
certifying
authority
cut
the
cost
for
amortization
purposes
to
an
amount
less
than
100%.
now,
in
an
answer
filed
by
the
government
which
is
contained
beginning
on
page
11
of
the
record,
reading
there,
"admits
the
allegations
of
paragraph
6
(a),
(b)
and
(c)."
the
portion
i
quoted
from
just
a
moment
ago
is
included
in
paragraph
6
(c)
and
was
admitted
to
by
the
government.
the
government
filed
its
answer
in
the
court
of
claims
on
november
15th,
1955.
in
order
to
get
the
matter
expeditiously
taken
cared
of,
we
filed
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
on
november
21st,
1955
or
less
than
one
week
after
the
answer
was
filed.
in
our
motion
for
a
summary
judgment,
we
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
government
had
admitted
to
all
of
the
essential
facts
and
the
government
had
offered
no
defense.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
item
even
constituting
a
slight
defense
in
the
government's
answer
is
the
prayer
wherefore
defendant
phrased
that
plaintiff
take
nothing
from
it
in
this
suit
and
that
the
same
be
dismissed
with
cause
against
the
plaintiff.
now,
in
our
motion
for
a
summary
judgment,
we
request
that
the
facts
are
found
as
stated
in
the
petition
filed
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff,
the
allen-bradley
company.
and
number
two,
that
judgment
shall
be
entered
for
plaintiff,
the
allen-bradley
company
against
the
defendant,
in
the
united
states
of
america
for
the
sum
of
$178,000
and
so
forth.
well,
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
what
did
the
government
do?
the
government
filed
an
answer
which
the
government
generally
stated
that
the
government
is
still
litigating
the
issue
and
believes
its
position
taken
in
a
week
in
so
higher
power
and
so
forth
to
be
correct.
it
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
tax
code
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
of
national
lead
had
decided
the
case
adversely
to
the
government
too
and
i
am
quoting
now
from
the
government's
answer.
“however,
an
appeal
was
filed
from
that
decision
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
was
argued
on
january
13th,
1956
but
has
not
yet
been
decided
by
that
court.
if
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
decides
the
issue
in
favor
of
the
government.
the
question
will
undoubtedly
be
ultimately
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
again,
nothing
further
by
way
of
the
defense
other
than
the
information
that
the
litigation
was
continuing
and
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
review
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
now,
the
national
lead
opinion,
the
national
lead
case
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
february
14th,
1956.
and
the
case
was
submitted
by
the
parties
in
the
court
of
claims
without
argument
on
march
5th,
1956,
at
which
time,
again
the
government
filed
a
one-page
defendant's
memorandum
of
additional
authority
citing
the
national
lead
case
decision
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
i
do
not
consider
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
as
a
trial
court.
i
do
not
consider
that
the
government
should
be
in
the
position
of
sitting
back
and
stating
nothing,
giving
no
position,
giving
no
authority,
not
even
stating
the
grounds
upon
which
it
is
seeking
to
defeat
our
claim
until
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
with
the
united
states
supreme
court.
and
i
might
state
in
that
respect
that
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
that
is
quite
well-established
and
it
is
contained
in
the
rules
of
the
court
of
claims
that
if
there
is
an
affirmative
defense,
the
matter
should
be
raised
in
a
pleading.
and
in
this
particular
case,
i
want
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
government
cannot
claim
that
it
had
no
knowledge
of
the
position
that
it
would
ultimately
hope
to
advance
in
this
court,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
national
lead
decision
of
the
second
circuit
was
almost
one
week
short
of
a-month-old
when
the
case
was
submitted
without
argument.
getting
to
the
matter
of
the
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
the
taxpayer
had
filed
a
petition
with
the
court
of
claims
in
which
we
alleged
that
these
certificates,
that
these
facilities
were
found
100%
necessary
and
the
government
agreed
with
that
contention.
we,
of
course,
pointed
out
in
our
petition
that
the
certifying
authority
did
limit
the
cost
for
amortization
purposes.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
now,
throughout
all
of
these
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
government
has
never
advanced
the
point
as
to
why
our
certificate
should
be
denied
other
than
the
law.
they
have
never
--
that
the
administrative
authority,
in
other
words,
had
the
authority
to
issue
fractional
claims.
now,
in
its
brief
before
this
court,
the
government,
i
--
i
get
the
point
now
that
you're
asking,
mr.
justice.
the
government
raises
a
point
we're
guilty
of
laches,
that
if
we
had
any
relief,
it
was
to
go
back
to
the
certifying
authority.
now,
for
the
first
time,
that
point
is
raised.it
was
never
raised
before
even
though
the
--
the
government
had
knowledge
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
the
national
lead
case.
now,
let's
go
on
to
the
matter
of
the
law.first
of
all,
in
the
briefs,
there
is
some
rather
broad
language
dealing
with
the
matter
of
the
authority
of
the
certifying
authority
to
issue
fractional
certificates.
in
the
first
place,
we
claim
that
isn't
at
issue
here.
we
claim
that
the
government
has
admitted
we
had
a
100%
certificates
even
though
the
certifying
authority
limited
us
as
to
the
amount
of
the
cost.i
think
it
important
to
specify.
and
when
we
use
language
such
as
the
alternative
of
issuing
a
certificate
or
of
having
the
government
finance
the
facility,
there
are
several
other
things
that
should
be
given
some
consideration.
in
the
first
place,
when
an
application
was
filed
or
when
a
certificate
of
necessity
was
granted,
there
was
no
knowledge
as
to
ultimate
cost.
the
application
gave
the
estimated
cost.
for
instance,
as
the
record
shows
in
our
case
on
page
5,
we
filed
an
application
with
estimated
cost
of
$927,000.
when
the
final
cost
was
computed,
the
cost
for
amortization
purpose
was
a
$1,014,000
or
approximately
10%
more
than
the
estimate.
now,
there
was
no
element
of
control
over
that,
whether
you
put
a
--
a
percentage
figure
in
there
or
not.
again,
on
the
record
on
page
6,
we
filed
an
application
estimated
cost
$274,600,
the
eventual
cost
only
$126,000.
and
in
like
manner,
the
third
certificate
varied
also
as
to
the
final
cost
in
relation
to
the
estimated
cost.
now,
it
has
been
stated
here
that
the
purpose
of
this
partial
certificate
or
partial
cost
certificates
was
to
allow
a
certificate
in
cases
where
it
was
decided
that
a
partial
certificate
was
better
than
the
government
financing
and
or
the
government
building
the
facilities.
once
again,
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
our
certificates,
there
were
involved
buildings
which
were
immediately
adjacent
to
the
taxpayer's
buildings.
now,
i
think
the
taxpayer
might
have
had
some
question
about
putting
an
office
building
--
or
i
mean
a
factory
building
connecting
up
with
its
own
building,
floor-by-floor.
secondly,
there
was
involved
special
machinery
and
that
special
machinery
was
entirely
within
the
know-how
of
the
allen-bradley
company.
it
wasn't
the
type
of
machinery
that
you
could
buy
at
commercial
sources.
it
could
only
be
built
by
the
allen-bradley
personnel
and
under
the
supervision
of
allen-bradley
engineers.
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
just
the
case
of
the
government
going
out
and
purchasing
a
milling
machine.
there
is
also
been
made
the
comment
that
originally,
100%
certificates
were
issued,
but
at
later,
our
productive
capacity
was
inflated
to,
or
shall
we
say,
increased
to
quite
an
extent.
and
at
that
point,
the
war
production
board
decided
that
we
had
enough
of
defense
facilities
acquired
under
certificates
and
perhaps
this
was
the
time
in
which
the
government
could
consider
the
post-war
usability
and
the
amount
of
money
that
the
government
could
realize
out
of
the
sale
of
these
facilities
in
the
post-war
world.
now,
let's
examine
that
a
moment.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
you
submit
a
physical
description
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
--
and
an
estimate
of
the
cost.
i
emphasized
that
first
because
that
was
the
most
important.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
when
it
is
approved,
they
issued
the
certificate
in
the
terms
up
to
80%
of
the
cost.
there
is
no
understanding,
though,
mr.
justice
as
to
the
dollars
of
cost.
you
see
what
i
mean,
whether
it's
double
or
half
or
three-fourths,
it's
80%
of
whatever
actual
cost
was
finally
incurred.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
well,
i
wouldn't
--
and
of
course
it's
the
question
we're
asking
too,
but
the
theory
behind
it
is
that
that
is
the
excessive
cost
induced
by
the
war.
putting
it
another
way
that
these
facilities
could
have
been
purchased
in
1939
for
one-fifth
of
what
they
cost
in
1942
and
1944,
and
the
80%
is
being
subject
to
amortization.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
well,
we
have
three
certificates,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
have
one
for
80%,
one
for
85%
and
the
last
one
which
is
the
smallest
amount
here
at
issue
was
only
35%.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
the
35%
certificate
was
issued
in
april
of
1945,
the
85%
in
march
of
1944
and
the
80%
in
december
of
1943.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
well,
your
honor,
because
in
our
opinion,
this
is
a
tax
case.
it
involves
that
statute
but
was
described
by
mr.
zarky,
involves
a
direction
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
--
as
to
his
method
of
computing
the
adjusted
basis,
the
cost
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
mr.
justice,
i
can
give
this
explanation
too.
if
it
wasn't
for
a
question
of
waiting,
having
been
in
tax
practice
all
my
life,
i
think
the
government
would
in
many
instances
that
be
cut
short
revenue.
in
many
instances,
they
based
their
contentions
upon
the
basis
of
decisions
and
opinions
and
analysis
of
law
that
were
not
prevalent
when
the
tax
return
was
filed.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
no,
there
was
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
these
type
of
certificate
issued
in
national
lead
was
--
which
we
have
discussed
a
few
moments
ago
was
the
same
type
we
have.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
we
--
we
went
ahead
and
built
the
facility,
that
is
right.
and
on
--
in
our
tax
return,
we
amortized
only
80%
of
the
cost.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
and
the
contention
here
before
the
court
was
raised
by
claims
for
refund
filed
later.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
well,
i
would
presume
it
was
the
court
of
claims
action
on
the
wickes
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
--
(voice
overlap)
case.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
i
would
presume
it
was
the
court
of
claims'
opinion
in
the
wickes
case.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
of
course
you
must
remember,
mr.
justice,
those
years
were
open
under
the
statute
of
limitation
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
--
which
is
a
knife
that
cuts
two
ways.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
had
established
for
us,
you
might
say.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
it
is
my
understanding
that
after
this
change
in
the
fall
of
1943,
they
did
not
give
100%
certificates,
shall
we
say
except
in
a
few
instances.
i
know
neither
way.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
then,
they
were
entirely
100%
certificates.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
because
that
is
how
--
this
is
my
explanation.
that
is
how
the
certifying
authority
analyzed
the
law.
in
other
words,
that
the
question
was,
what
is
the
physical
use
of
these
facilities?
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
and
if
--
if
the
physical
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
there's
no
--
no
dollar
question
in
(inaudible)
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes.
you
would
--
you
would
give
an
estimate
as
to
what
the
cost
would
be?
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
no,
that
is
not
correct
because
they
didn't
know
what
the
cost
was
going
to
be
in
the
earlier
days
of
this
either
and
yet
they
gave
100%
certificates.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
no.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
no,
they
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
who
gave
the
final
answer
as
the
cost.
because
let's
assume
--
i
think
this
might
help
explain
it.
let's
assume
that
a
manufacturer
purports
to
devote
100,000
square
foot
of
area,
the
manufacturing
gets
a
certificate,
$2
million.
and
then,
the
commissioner
of
internal
--
of
internal
revenue
through
his
agents
finds
out
that
only
one-fifth
of
that
was
devoted
to
manufacturing.
let's
assume
the
other
80%
was
devoted
to
employ
amusements,
bowling
alleys
and
what
have
you,
the
commissioner
could
strike
out
the
portion
that
was
not
devoted
to
war
production.
in
other
words,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
through
his
agents
was
in
fact
the
final
fact
finding
person
here
involved.
and
you
see,
i
might
point
out
one
of
the
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
that
is
all.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes,
subject
to
verification
by
the
commissioner,
of
course.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
five
years.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
20%.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
that's
right.
i
want
to
point
this
out
though
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
there
are
only
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
no,
your
honor.
only
in
the
respect
that
in
correspondence
as
is
shown
by
the
record,
they
did
point
out
in
this
first
certificate
here
at
issue
that
they
were
cutting
down
the
certificates
from
100%
to
something
less.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
suggested
25%.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
well,
i
presume
we
learned
it
by
force
of
the
fact
that
this
certificate
was
addressed
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
it
wasn't
addressed
to
us,
and
we
got
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
well,
i
would
presume
when
we
received
the
certificate,
the
copy
of
the
certificate.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
we
would
be
shut
down.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
we
did
nothing
at
that
time.
of
course,
one
should
appreciate
that
this
company,
like
many
others,
was
busy
in
producing
these
things
and
in
getting
the
facilities
created.
now,
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
speak
just
a
moment
on
the
alleged
reason
for
this
change
of
principle.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
he
could
to
the
extent
that
we
didn't
follow
our
original
application,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
in
one
case.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
oh,
yes.
in
the
case
of
arkansas
--
let
me
cite
this,
arkansas-oklahoma
gas
company
12
--
tax
court
1208.
the
taxpayer
had
a
certificate
of
necessity
covering
intangible
drilling
and
development
cost
of
gas
wells.
nevertheless,
the
tax
court
held
amortization
of
such
cause
was
not
allowable
even
though
the
taxpayer
had
a
certificate
because
it
didn't
fit
of
the
description
of
the
law.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
your
--
your
honor
--
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
--
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
had
the
final
authority
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
complied
with
your
application,
what
your
cause
were.
in
other
words,
it
is
easy
to
be
presumed
that
some
taxpayers
might
have
loaded
this
facility
cost
and
tried
to
charge
everything
in
there.
and
it
--
it
was
the
--
within
the
discretion
of
the
commissioner
to
take
out
whatever
didn't
belong
in
there,
particularly,
where
your
building.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
allen-bradley
company
was
building
a
special
machinery
in
its
own
shops.
well,
obviously,
there's
quite
an
accounting
question
there
as
to
what
part
of
cost
were
applicable
to
those
machines.
mr.
harvey
w.
peters
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
the
distinguishing
element.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
determination
of
the
physical
necessity
in
the
facilities.
that
is
the
point
exactly.
now,
we
are
not
denying,
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that.
we
are
not
denying
that
the
certifying
authority
had
the
right
to
say
that
certain
of
these
facilities
were
partially
--
partially
necessary
for
the
war
effort
and
partially
not
necessary.
to
explain
that,
let's
assume
we
had
100,000
square
foot
of
factory
floor
area
and
25%
was
going
to
be
an
employees
recreation
room.
they
might
have
said,
“well,
that
part
is
not
a
defense
facility,”
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
cost
factor
that's
here
involved.now
finally,
in
1943,
they
say
that
because
we
had
such
an
inflation
in
our
productive
facility
that
the
government
decided
there
were
some
post-war
use
they
want
to
capture.
now
frankly,
i
submit
that's
somewhat
awkward
if
not
ridiculous.
if
in
1940,
our
productive
facilities
were
overbuilt
and
congress
recognized
the
fact,
well
what
was
it
in
1943
or
1944
when
10
or
12
billion
more
had
been
added?
and
just
how
could
we
ascribe
a
post-war
use
after
seeing
the
10
or
12
billion
more
of
facilities
added
to
the
pile.
one
last
point.
there
has
been
some
comment
in
the
briefs
that
this
is
unfair.
now,
what
was
the
incentive
under
this
amortization
privilege?
it
was
the
possibility
of
having
a
usable
plant
after
the
war
was
over.
i'm
not
going
to
deny
that.
i'm
going
to
insist
upon
it,
because
the
second
revenue
act
of
1940
said,
“we
will
take
every
cent
of
your
income
above
normal.”
in
other
words,
if
you
are
a
corporation
or
some
other
employer
and
you're
going
to
put
five
million
more
in
--
in
additional
plant,
the
second
revenue
act
and
succeeding
revenue
act
said,
“we
are
going
to
take
every
cent
of
that
income."
well,
where
was
the
incentive
for
building
a
million
dollar
plant?it
was
exactly
in
this
amortization
provision.
in
other
words,
since
your
income
was
85%
taxable
anyway,
you
could,
by
building
a
million
dollar
plant
have
an
actual
cost
of
$150,000.
at
the
end
of
the
war,
that
plant
might
be
useless,
but
at
least
you
would
have
suffered
nothing
but
that
you
would
have
had
a
new
plant
at
a
cost
of
$150,000.
thank
you.
