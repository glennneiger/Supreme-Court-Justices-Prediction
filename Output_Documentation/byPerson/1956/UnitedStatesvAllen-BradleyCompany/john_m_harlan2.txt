justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that
point?
in
the
next
case,
which
is
the
second
circuit
case,
the
second
circuit
as
i
understand
it
didn't
reach
the
underlying
question
as
to
the
interpretation
of
section
124
(f).
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
went
under
procedural
ground,
namely,
that
mandamus
would
not
rely
and
that
the
determination
could
not
be
collaterally
attacked
in
the
--
in
the
tax
proceeding,
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
would
not
mean
that
you'd
necessarily
reach
the
question
that
is
the
underlying
question,
as
to
whether
the
wpb
had
the
power
in
the
first
instance
to
grant
100%
certificate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
reach
that
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
so.
my
difficulty
is
that
it
--
that
in
the
second
case,
unless
you
revert
--
unless
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
i
don't
see
how
we
reach
the
underlying
tax
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
would,
but
still
you
could
also
reach
the
second,
the
case
you're
now
arguing
by
saying,
the
court
of
--
the
court
of
claims
is
wrong
in
not
following
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
then
it
disposes
the
case
that
way,
and
--
and
in
that
event
you
wouldn't
reach
the
underlying
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
i
understood
it
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
--
when
that
administrative
practice
was
changed
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
the
partial
certificate
practice,
was
there
a
change
made
in
the
statute
at
the
same
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
--
and
the
--
of
the
--
what
about
the
regulations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
8
(a).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
physical
--
the
physical
structure
was
certainly
always
in
the
interest
of
the
national
the
national
defense.
otherwise,
it
would
never
have
come
into
being,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
that
these
partial
certificates
don't
say
so
much
of
the
structure,
physical
structures
needed
for
the
national
defense,
and
the
right
to
do
business.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
says
so
much
of
the
cost.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
about
the
mechanics
of
these
transactions.
when
you
first
started
on
your
facility,
do
you
submit
an
estimate
to
the
government
as
to
what
it's
going
to
cost?
justice
john
m.
harlan
physical
description.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
now,
at
that
stage
when
it's
approved,
do
you
know
whether
you're
going
to
be
--
is
there
any
discussion
as
to
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
100%
certificate
or
35%
certificate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
the
80%?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then
later
on
--
excuse
me,
later
on
then
you
get
a
further
certificate
which
may
be
a
50%
certificate
or
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
that
i
was
--
maybe
i
haven't
made
it
clear.
at
the
time
that
you
agreed
with
the
government
to
go
ahead
with
this
facility,
was
there
a
representation
by
the
government
that
you
were
going
to
get
a
100%
--
a
100%
certificate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
80%.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
accepted
that
certificate
and
went
ahead
on
that
basis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
80%.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you
--
you
went
ahead
with
your
construction
accepting
the
80%.
you
filed
your
tax
returns
on
the
basis
of
the
80%
and
then
later
on,
you
sued
for
a
claim
--
sued
for
refund.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
gave
rise
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
government
is
trying
to
tax
you
on
some
other
basis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
appreciate
that.
