justice
felix
frankfurter
sorry
to
interrupt
you
so
early.
you're
not
taking
a
point
--
making
a
point
though
but
though,
as
you
just
said
there
was
no
(inaudible)
along
the
line
you're
arguing,
did
i
hear
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
making
a
point
of
that
in
substantive
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
want
to
know
now
in
the
arguments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
being
the
case.
this
is
johnson
and
zerbst.
are
you
making
that
point
--
let's
see
if
i'm
off
the
problem.
and
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
going
to
say
there
was
no
counsel
at
any
stage
in
this
case
until
you
were
assigned
happily
by
the
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
next
question
is,
are
you
raising
explicitly
johnson
and
zerbst?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
is
raised
as
to
the
non-assignment
of
counsel
into
this
position
at
any
time
up
to
this
--
up
to
the
time
you
get
here.
but
i'm
not
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
derivative
arguments
but
you
and
i
ought
to
understand
each
other,
is
this
a
johnson
and
zerbst
situation?
your
answer
is
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
johnson
and
zerbst
are
being
decided
by
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
well,
i'm
taking
up
--
but
i
still
don't
understand.go
on,
you
make
it
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
the
prophecy
that
in
the
effect
a
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
prove
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
begs
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
beneficial
or
not,
he
doesn't
want
the
insignificancies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
this
has
given
rise
to
this
issue,
raises
the
very
question
that
as
i
understand
johnson
and
zerbst,
the
johnson
and
zerbst
was
partly
directed
toward
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
out
of
this
thing
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
i
ask
this
myself
that
this
so
far
as
--
i
haven't
read
your
brief,
i
just
looked
at
the
table
of
the
contents
and
authority.
i'm
making
sure
that
they
don't
cite
it
in
your
reply
brief
(inaudible),
for
myself,
when
if
i
may
say
so,
competent
a
lawyer
as
you
do
not
acknowledge
johnson
and
zerbst.
its
intelligently
waived
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
what
i
don't.
you
say
this
is
a
call.
this
is
predictable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
15?
justice
felix
frankfurter
also
with
reference
to
the
lawyer?
you've
read
a
little
while
ago.
you
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
an
individualized
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that's
what
--
that
to
me
would
--
i
would
be
entitled
to
(inaudible)
because
that
was
an
ad
hoc
petition
and
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
seen
what's
on
file
in
this
court
and
that
includes
what
the
clerk
said
--
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
said
it
would
be
original.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
have
to
bother
about
that,
(inaudible)
that
can
be
dispose
off
for
a
reason.
i'm
right
about
your
construction
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
those
improper
clauses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
the
final
disposition
used.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
a
specific
provisions
in
the
constitutional
law
before
you
get
to
confirm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
in
the
case,
whether
he
did
or
didn't
on
the
circumstance
of
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
in
this
case
whether
what
judge
joyce
did
was
final,
definitive
so
that
he
was
functus
officio.
that's
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can
infer
(inaudible)
in
order
to
show
the
judges'
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
question
when
they
did
dispose
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
present
statute
over
a
period
of
probation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five
years.
it
was
the
day
that
he
was
sentenced
with
one
of
the
--
the
original
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
october,
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
october
3rd,
is
--
judge
joyce
had
on
that
day
said,
i
put
you
on
probation.
how
long
a
period
within
which
--
how
long
the
period
was
there?
how
many
--
how
much
time
i
had
was
there,
within
which
pollard
could
have
been
brought
into
each
definitively
that
he
explicitly
sentenced
by
jail
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
so
that
the
period
of
time
is
illegal,
very
significant
provided
judge
joyce's
actual
(inaudible)
the
power
to
sentence
foremost,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
don't
see
what
the
two-year
has
to
do
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
both
(inaudible)
and
if
it
wasn't,
then
two
days
was
too
much.
he
couldn't
do
anything.
