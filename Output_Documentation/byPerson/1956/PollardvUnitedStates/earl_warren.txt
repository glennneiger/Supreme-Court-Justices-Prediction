chief
justice
earl
warren
pollard,
petitioner,
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
boskey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boskey
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
--
go
right
ahead
and
answer
the
question.
i
thought
you
had
finished.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
admits
that's
untrue,
doesn't
it
mr.
boskey?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
will
ask
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
government
admits
that
he
wasn't
present
when
this
order
was
--
was
announced
by
the
judge.
it
couldn't
be
true,
but
it
--
but
are
possibly
be
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this,
just
a
matter
of
interest,
mr.
boskey?
did
the
government
give
any
notice
to
him
in
the
penitentiary
that
the
state
penitentiary
that
he
had
been
placed
on
probation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
clerk
sent
him
a
notice
of
--
of
this
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
the
statute
give
him
a
--
give
him
a
right
to
make
a
statement
in
litigation
of
punishment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
boskey,
would
you
discuss
for
a
moment
the
--
the
question
of
a
speedy
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
boskey.
mr
elman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
government's
view
on
whether
this
was
a
fair
proceeding
or
not
so
far
as
this
defendant
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
do
that
on
those
adjectives
and
just
say
do
you
--
do
you
think
so
far
as
this
proceeding
is
concerned
or
does
the
government
feel
so
far
as
this
proceeding
is
concerned
that
it
was
a
--
a
fair
proceeding
insofar
as
this
defendant
was
concerned
and
so
far
as
any
future
defendants
are
--
are
concerned
in
the
event
we
sustain
the
action
of
the
government
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that
reaches
the
question
of
fairness,
i
mean.
because
you're
--
you're
going
to
turn
right
around
now
as
i
understand
it
and
defend
this
--
defend
this
record.
then
i
--
i'd
like
to
know
as
long
as
you're
admitting
the
illegality
of
these
proceedings,
whether
you
--
whether
you
are
also
of
a
mind
that
it
is
--
is
unfair
or
whether
you
contend
that
this
man
did
have
a
fair
trial
or
fair
proceeding
that
this
court
should
sustain.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
think
--
i
think
the
key
problem
here
is
whether
there's
been
fairness
to
the
defendant
not
to
the
judge.
that's
--
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
there
--
what
is
there
in
that
--
in
the
language
that
--
of
the
judge
at
that
time
to
disprove
that
contention
of
mr.
boskey's?
could
you
point
it
out
for
me
please?
take
his
language
and
--
and
see
if
there's
anything
in
there
that
would
disprove
that
contention
of
mr.
boskey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
--
let's
stay
with
that
for
just
a
moment.
now,
what
is
there
in
the
record
in
the
court
that
morning
to
indicate
anything
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
petitioner
herein?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
can
you
point
to
--
what
can
you
point
to
in
the
record
to
show
that
that
wasn't
the
intention
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
done
in
any
--
in
other
instances
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
why
don't
you
read
--
why
don't
you
read
what
he
said
to
us
and
that's
very
--
it's
very
short
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it's
very
simple
and
very
plain
to
me.
i
thought
that
the
extent
of
his
order
--
suppose
you
read
it.
it's
only
half
page
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
care
for
all
of
it,
but
if
there's
anything
there
--
in
there
that
would
indicate
that
he
wasn't
finished
with
the
case
at
that
time.
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
have
it
read.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
whether
it's
reasonable
or
not.
i
don't
know
what
pressures
were
applied
to
him
in
the
meantime.
i
don't
know
what
the
united
states
attorney
said
to
him.
i
don't
know
what
the
newspapers
might
have
said
to
him.
i
don't
know
what
anybody
might
have
said
to
him
that
caused
him
to
--
caused
him
to
have
that
change
of
heart.
but
one
thing
i
do
know,
he
didn't
even
notify
the
defendant
that
he
put
him
on
probation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
can
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
let
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ask
you
this.
you
--
your
position
is
that
the
definitive
action
was
taken
two
years
later
in
the
courtroom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
that's
your
position
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
it
was
definitive
and
that
it
was
legal.
suppose
instead
of
being
two
years,
it
had
been
20
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
it
was
10?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
three
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
he
only
did
that
after
the
two-year
lapse.
suppose
--
suppose
it's
set
on
five
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
admit
that
that's
--
that's
totally
ineffective,
that
it's
totally
illegal
and
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
can't
refer
--
you
can't
refer
back
to
that
as
i
see
it
to
support
your
--
your
--
any
conclusion
so
far
as
the
--
the
order
two
years
later
is
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
mind
didn't
amount
anything
after
he'd
--
after
he'd
excuse
the
defendant
and
had
purported
to
--
to
dispose
of
the
case
because
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
law
says
that
the
--
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
be
present
whenever
he
is
sentenced
and
whenever
the
judge
takes--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
action
against
him.
this
man
was
not
present.
he
had
been
released
by
the
--
by
the
court
with
the
statement,
you
go
back
and
--
and
do
--
do
the
best
you
can.
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
were
the
terms
--
what
terms
of
probation
did
the
--
did
the
judge
laid
down
even
in
--
in
october
of
1954?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
terms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so,
either
time.
what
--
what
were
the
terms
of
probation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
illegal
act
of
the
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
know
about
that
probation
order
the
day
it
was
rendered.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
you
were
--
that's
the
burden
you
were
putting
on
him.
just
now,
you
said
that
if
he
had
gone
back
that
same
day
and
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
that
day.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
response
to
what
should
he
have
gone
back
to
the
district
judge?1
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
order
of
the
court,
or
any
notice
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman,
your
reference
to
judge
joyce,
i
just
like
to
say
that
--
that
no
--
no
necessity
for
us
to
condemn
judge
joyce
as
you
suggest
it
might
be
necessary
to
decide
for
this
defendant.
many
a
fine
judge
has
rendered
a
judgment
against
a
defendant
that
must
be
reversed
without
--
without
any
necessity
of
condemning
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
judge
and
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
like
you
to
put
us
in
to
that
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
suggest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
judge
joyce
should
not
be
condemned
because
we're
not
here
to
condemn
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we're
here
to
--
well,
all
we're
here
for
is
to
see
that
this
man
gets
a
square
deal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
doubt
very
much
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
doubt
very
much
whether
we
even
have
to
read
his
mind
to
that
extent.
i
think
we're
--
i
think
we're
governed
by
what
happened,
not
--
not
by
what
he
might
have
been
thinking
at
that
time,
either
--
either
he
sentenced
him
or
he
released
him.
one
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
one
of
the
two
and
i
don't
think
that
--
that
what
he
thought
later
or
at
the
instance
of
the
--
of
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney
need
determined
what's
the
rights
of
this
man
are.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
take
it
on
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
elman,
it
says
it's
reasonable
to
--
to
me
to
say
that
if
the
judge
did
change
his
mind
with
the
great
experience
that
he
had
had
20
years
on
--
on
the
bench
that
he
would
have
said,
“oh
my
goodness,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
sentence
this
man
properly.
he
ought
to
be
brought
back
here.
and
i
ought
to
sentence
him
when
--
when
he's
in
the
presence
of
the
--
of
the
court.”
and
therefore,
we
will
bring
the
man
back
for
proper
sentence
but
he
--
he
didn't
do
that.
he
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
any
type
of
sentence
which
meant
that
he
haven't
sentenced
him
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
basically,
we're
indulging
on
an
awful
lot
of
presumptions
to
sustain
this
--
this
procedure
as
bad
as
you
apparently
think
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
think
we
ought
to
presume.
he
wants
to
--
to
do
it
regularly.
but
--
but
i
would
also
presume
that
if
he
--
if
he
thought
the
probation
officer
didn't
understand
that
he
had
placed
the
man
on
probation
or
if
given
a
man
a
sentence
at
all
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
who
was
not
represented
by
counsel
might
be
equally
confused.
and
in
that
event,
i
would
think
if
we're
in
dealing
--
dealing
in
presumptions
that
a
judge
would
say,
“well
now,
if
i
didn't
make
that
clear,
if
i
didn't
place
this
man
on
probation,
if
i
didn't
render
any
kind
of
a
judgment,
if
i
didn't
give
him
any
sentence,
then
for
goodness
sakes,
bring
him
back
here
and
let's
--
let's
clear
this
matter
up
instead
of
just
saying,
no,
put
it
down
for
three
years.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
mr
boskey,
thank
you
for
accepting
this
assignment
and
performing
this
public
service
on
--
on
behalf
of
this
impoverished
man.
