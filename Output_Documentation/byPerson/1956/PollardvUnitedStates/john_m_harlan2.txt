justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
construe
that
as
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
read
that
as
authorizing
in
a
disposition
of
the
case
which
is
neither
dismissal
nor
a
sentence
which
sort
of
living
it
up
in
the
air?
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
least,
doing
nothing,
put
it
that
way,
doing
nothing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
a
deliberate
effort
here
to
misrepresent
the
record
in
the
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
been
reading
this
petition
for
certiorari
and
perhaps
i'm
mistaken
in
my
impression,
you
correct
me.
but
i
get
the
impression
that
this
man
knew
well
before
the
two-year
period
that
his
sentence
was
illegal
and
that
he
thought
he'd
be
well
advised
to
let
matters
stand
and
not
stir
things
up.
justice
john
m.
harlan
here's
what
i'm
referring
to,
i'll
read
it
to
you.
mr.
lee
was
the
probation
man
i
suppose,
isn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
told
him
that
he
was
right
on
summarizing
nullity.
he'd
investigated
then
he
found
his
sentence
was
illegal.
and
then
he
goes
on
in,
this
--
this
respondent
--
the
petitioner
goes
on
and
says
mr.
lee
--
a
further
conversation
and
mr.
lee
at
this
time,
and
that
was
about
a
year
before
the
second
sentence
was
imposed,
led
me
to
believe
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
pursue
the
matter
further.
being
unlearned
at
law,
i
had
no
knowledge
as
to
what
further
complication
there
could
or
might
have
become
involved
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
