mr.
bennett
boskey
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
via
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
on
writ
of
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
having
declined
to
allow
petitioner's
appeal
in
forma
pauperis,
this
court
thereafter
allowed
certiorari
in
forma
pauperis.
in
the
proceedings,
in
all
courts
below
and
at
all
stages
prior
to
the
case
arriving
in
this
court,
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
anytime.
counsel
for
the
first
time
having
been
appointed
after
the
case
reached
this
court
and
after
certiorari
was
granted.
the
fact
that
the
case
is
here
on
these
circumstances
is
an
eloquent
tribute
to
the
american
system
of
justice.
but
the
circumstances
which
impelled
the
court
to
bring
the
case
here
and
the
circumstances
which
are
disclosed
by
this
record
are
circumstances
which
show
what
a
wide
gap
there
can
be
between
the
standards
which
this
court
has
laid
down
for
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
and
the
manner
in
which
those
standards
are
carried
out
in
actual
practice
in
some
of
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bennett
boskey
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
said
that
i
think
it's
relevant
to
some
of
the
points
i
come
to.
mr.
bennett
boskey
in
my
brief,
i
have
referred
to
it
but
one
of
the
times
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir,
i
am.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
is
not
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
whether
happy
or
not,
your
honor,
there
were
no
counsel
in
this
case
until
i
was
assigned
by
the
court.
the
circumstances
which
this
record
discloses
will
show
that
counsel
ought
to
have
been
assigned
or
else
that
other
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
case
is
not
johnson
and
zerbst
as
such
because
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
because
petitioner
knowingly
pleaded
guilty
as
i
was
just
about
to
say.
no
question
is
raised
as
to
the
propriety
or
validity
of
his
plea
of
guilty.
this
case
doesn't
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
sir,
i
have
not
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
i
didn't.
i
said
with
respect
to
the
plea
of
guilty,
it
is
not
a
johnson
and
zerbst
situation.
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
what
happened
on
the
sentence,
the
absence
of
counsel
seems
to
me
relevant
to
the
arguments
i
want
to
make
here.
now,
johnson
and
zerbst
was
a
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
because
johnson
and
zerbst
was
a
case
in
which
counsel
was
absent
at
the
time.
the
--
the
conviction
was
entered.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
the
--
the
case
arose
in
the
district
of
minnesota,
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
minnesota.
the
offense
alleged
was
an
offense
under
section
1702
of
the
criminal
code.
it
was
alleged
and
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
to
the
allegation.
it
was
alleged
that
petitioner
had
taken
from
the
united
states
mails
a
check,
a
treasury
check
before
the
delivery
to
the
owner
thereof.
petitioner
having
no
counsel
pleaded
guilty.
his
plea
of
guilty
is
not
an
issue.
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
before
judge
joyce
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
minnesota
in
september
of
1952.
and
thereupon,
the
judge
referred
the
case,
in
fact
for
a
probation
report.
approximately
three
weeks
later
on
october
3rd,
1952,
the
court
--
the
court
called
the
case
up
for
sentence.
what
happened
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
on
october
3rd,
1952
is
vital
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
when
the
case
was
called,
the
united
states
attorney
said
that
the
matter
was
here
for
sentencing.
the
judge
had
a
colloquy
with
the
defendant.
and
in
the
course
of
that
colloquy
as
the
record
shows
on
pages
4
to
6
and
as
i've
set
forth
in
my
brief
in
full
on
pages
7
and
9,
as
the
record
shows,
the
judge
asked
the
defendant
some
questions
about
his
history.
it
turned
out
the
defendant
at
the
time
the
case
came
up
to
sentencing
was
in
the
minnesota
state
prison
and
still
was
serving
a
sentence
and
he
was
shortly
due
to
come
out
for
a
parole.
the
judge
ascertained
as
apparently
he
had
ascertained
from
the
probation
report
that
the
petitioner
have
had
an
alcoholic
history
and
this
particular
episode
of
taking
the
check
from
the
government
--
taking
the
government
check
from
the
mail
had
arisen
during
an
alcoholic
spree.
he
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
probation
report
showed
that
petitioner
had
voluntary
brought
this,
the
fact
to
this
offense
to
the
attention
of
alcoholics
anonymous
and
then
to
the
attention
of
the
fbi.
the
petitioner's
record
in
the
minnesota
state
penitentiary
was
a
good
record
and
he
indicated
that
he
had
licked
the
alcohol
problem
and
he
said
this
appeal
to
him.
he
said
to
the
defendant
the
--
that
you
ought
to
know
the
misery
and
the
grief
of
continued
drinking
on
your
part
and
he
gave
him
advice
that
the
moment
he
got
out
of
prison,
he
should
go
to
alcoholics
anonymous
to
do
what
they
told
them
to
do.
he
said
with
your
background
and
with
your
ability,
i
think
that
you
can
win
this
fight.
then
he
said
and
i
think
this
is
the
source
of
the
great
difference
between
myself
and
the
government
in
this
case,
then
he
said,
“if
you
don't
do
those
things
and
if
you
want
to
revert
to
drinking,
you
will
be
back
here
again
because
you
will
commit
some
federal
offense
and
i
won't
be
talking
to
you
this
way
if
you
were
ever
before
me
again.
so,
good
luck
to
you
and
i
hope
the
parole
board
will
give
you
an
opportunity.
that
is
all.”
and
the
defendant
said,
“thank
you
very
much,
sir.”
and
the
defendant
was
taken
in
the
courtroom
and
returned
to
the
minnesota
state
penitentiary.
several
months
later,
he
was
paroled.
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
construction
that
the
--
we
placed
on
this
for
petitioner
is
that
the
judge
made
a
final
disposition
of
the
case
but
the
judge
decided
under
the
circumstances
which
had
been
brought
to
a
detention
that
although
the
man
was
guilty
of
the
offense.
nevertheless,
it
was
a
case
where
neither
imprisonment
nor
probation
should
be
imposed
and
that
so
far
as
the
federal
authorities
were
concerned,
the
petitioner
should
be
allowed
to
go
from
the
court
a
freeman.
and
i
point
out
in
this
connection,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
statute
under
which
this
offense
was
committed
and
under
which
the
information
was
filed
is
a
statute
which
does
not
provide
for
any
minimum
level
of
punishment.
unlike
many
other
federal
criminal
statutes
which
say
that
a
man
shall
be
sentenced
to
not
less
than
so
many
years
in
jail
or
fine
not
less
than
so
many
dollars
this
statute
does
not
say
that.
the
statute
says
that
the
punishment
shall
be
not
more
than
five
years
in
jail
or
not
more
than
$2000
fine
or
both.
but
it
leaves
completely
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge
the
question
whether
some
punishment
should
be
imposed
and
if
so,
how
much.
and
it
was
in
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
as
we
look
at
this
record.
it
was
in
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
that
the
judge
sent
this
man
out
of
court
without
committing
him
to
jail
and
without
fining.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
believe
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
as
we
read
the
transcript,
the
judge
didn't
do
nothing
but
we
think
that
the
transcript
shows
the
deliberate
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
judge
to
impose
no
imprisonment
and
to
impose
no
fund.
now,
as
i
say
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
when
he
said
the
parole
board,
sir,
he
meant
the
parole
board
of
the
minnesota
state
penitentiary
where
the
petitioner
was
then
incarcerated
and
where
petitioner
was
coming
up
for
release
within
the
next
month
or
two.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
said
--
he
said,
if
--
if
you
don't
do
these
things,
he
said
mr.
justice
clark,
if
you
don't
this
--
do
these
things
and
if
you
want
to
revert
to
drinking,
you
will
be
back
here
again
because
you
will
commit
some
federal
offense.
and
that's
just
the
point
we
made.
if
the
judge
did
not
say
it
because
you
will
violate
your
probation.
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
he
had
no
intention
to
place
this
man
on
probation
and
that
he
was
warning
him
against
doing
something
else.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
certainly
a
prophecy.
now,
later
in
the
day
after
the
defendant
had
been
taken
from
the
courtroom
in
an
ex
parte
manner,
the
united
states
attorney
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
--
excuse
me,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
in
which
the
government
says
arose
because
he
was
uncertain
as
to
the
judge's
disposition
of
the
case
came
before
the
judge
and
said
that
he
we
wanted
to
go
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
which
the
judge
had
made
of
the
case.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
--
yes,
that's
the
government's
position
that
the
united
states
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
record
shows
absolutely
nothing
as
to
what
reason
he
had
for
coming
back,
except
that
he
said,
he
did
say
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
clearly,
your
honor.
because
going
back
to
the
case
of
pollard
who
appeared
this
morning,
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
clearly.
is
there
to
be
a
probationary
period
after
his
release
from
stillwater
or
any
type
of
sentencing?
the
court
then
said
it
was
to
commence
that
the
expiration
of
this
release
from
stillwater
and
said
that
the
probation
would
last
for
three
years.
thereupon,
and
petitioner
as
the
government
admits,
he
was
not
present
during
this
interchange
with
the
judge.
thereupon,
an
order
was
entered
in
the
records
of
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
district
of
minnesota
suspending
or
purporting
to
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
placing
or
purporting
to
place
petitioner
on
probation
for
a
period
of
three
years.
mr.
bennett
boskey
several
--
there
was
no
lawyer
there
even,
mr.
justice
black,
at
that
time.
the
only
person
there
so
far
as
the
transcript
shows
with
the
judge,
the
reporter
and
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney.
and
the
government
i
might
i
say
admits
that
this
order
entered
in
this
manner
was
wholly
invalid.
the
government
admits
that
sentence
cannot
be
passed
upon
a
man
in
his
absence.
there's
no
disagreement
between
the
government
and
myself
on
that
fact.
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
man
never
had
counsel.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
was
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
would
not
have
thought
that
if
there
has
been
a
confident,
intelligent
waiver
of
counsel
which
this
record
does
not
show
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
i
would
not
have
thought
then
that
johnston
versus
zerbst
would
prevent
the
waiver
from
being
effective
at
the
time
(voice
overlap).
mr.
bennett
boskey
if
the
record
does
not
show
that
and
if
the
absence
of
counsel,
his
work
to
the
prejudice
of
the
defendant
then
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
but
i
--
i
think
now
i'm
coming
back
to
the
question
justice
frankfurter
asked
me
a
little
earlier,
at
the
initial
hearing
on
the
morning
of
the
october
3rd,
the
manner
--
the
disposition
which
the
judge
made
of
the
case
was
a
disposition
essentially
beneficial
to
the
defendant
as
we
look
at
the
record.
if
we
are
correct
about
the
disposition
that
was
made,
the
judge
sent
the
man
out
of
court
free
from
any
control
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir.
but
i
say
if
we
read
the
transcript
properly,
it
was
beneficial
to
the
defendant
and
therefore,
the
absence
of
the
counsel
at
that
time
i
would
think
would
not
have
been
prejudicial
to
him.
he
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
the
right
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
we
certainly
have
them.
we
--
actually,
petitioner
has
had
two
lawsuits
out
there.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
the
petitioner
certainly
has
no
disagreement
with
that
and
i
hope
the
government
doesn't
either.
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
whether
the
petitioner
also
feels
he's
entitled
to
claim
the
benefit
but
the
final
disposition
that
was
made
of
the
case
in
his
favor
on
the
morning
of
october
3rd,
1952,
whether
counsel
was
present
or
not
and
whether
he
was
advised
to
his
right
to
have
counsel
assigned
or
not.
nevertheless,
there
was
a
beneficial
--
as
--
as
we
look
at
the
transcript,
there
was
a
beneficial
disposition
and
we
think
that
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
benefit.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i'm
not
disclaiming
that
part
of
johnston
and
zerbst,
mr.
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
justice
black.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i'm
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
precisely.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
--
he
had
pleaded
guilty
three
weeks
prior
to
the
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
bennett
boskey
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
he
did.
the
transcript
that
has
come
up
does
not
include
anything
that
happened
in
the
courtroom,
if
anything
did
on
a
day
in
which
he
pleaded
guilty.
there
is
no
showing
that
he
waived
counsel
in.
mr.
bennett
boskey
there
is
--
excuse
me.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
was
going
to
say
there
is
in
the
order
which
was
entered
after
the
session
on
october
3,
1952.
if
you'll
turn,
mr.
justice
clark,
to
page
6
of
the
transcript.
mr.
bennett
boskey
there
is
what
i
would
call
a
fictitious
recital
because
it's
wholly
rebutted
by
the
transcript,
by
the
actual
transcript.
it
says
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
referring
to
this
october
3,
1952
hearing.
it
says
that
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
this
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
october
3,
1952
is
the
hearing
--
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
sir.
the
first
sentencing
hearing
but
three
weeks
after
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered.
to
those
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
sir,
not
two
years.
this
is
the
first
hearing
and
there
is
this
what
i
would
call
a
fictitious
entry
in
this
order,
so
far
as
the
transcript
shows
which
says,
“the
court
advised
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
asked
him
whether
he
desired
to
have
counsel
appointed
by
the
court
and
the
defendant
thereupon
stated
that
he
waived
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.”
now,
i
must
say
that
the
court,
that
this
is
taken
from
a
credit
form
or
form
of
some
sort,
insertions
have
been
made
wholly
without
regard
to
the
true
stated
facts
as
shown
by
the
transcript.
and
one
of
the
points
we
have
been
making
is
that
here,
as
well
as
that
the
hearing
that
occurred
two
years
later,
false
and
fictitious
entries
apparently
have
been
made
in
orders
of
the
district
court
which
make
look
as
if
the
proceedings
were
in
much
more
regular
than
in
fact
they
were.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
say
sir
that
the
transcript,
the
complete
transcripts
certified
up
here
by
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
conclusively
shows
that
this
recital
is
untrue.
and
when
i
get
to
the
order
that
was
added
two
years
later,
i'll
show
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
that
order
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
if
my
time
permits
me.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
don't
think
the
government
has
commented
on
this
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bennett
boskey
he
was
present
on
the
morning
sir
and
not
in
the
afternoon
when
this
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
when
this
order
was
entered.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that
is
conceded
and
the
government
concedes
the
order
is
invalid.
it
admits
that
i
--
i
think
it
admits
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
a
man
could
not
be
sentenced
while
he
isn't
present
and
i
think
it
admits
that
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
part
from
the
due
process
clause.
a
man
could
not
be
sentenced
when
he
isn't
present.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
i
come
to
that
now.
he
says
in
his
motion
to
vacate
because
this
arises
as
you
know
under
section
2255
on
a
motion
to
vacate.
he
says
in
his
motion
to
vacate
that
when
he
was
about
to
leave
the
stillwater
penitentiary
to
--
in
november,
around
thanksgiving
time,
he
was
told
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
that
he
ought
to
get
in
touch
with
the
federal
probation
office
and
that
he
didn't
understand
what
this
is
was
all
about
and
none
of
the
minnesota
state
officials
understood
it.
but
he
says
he
got
in
touch
with
mr.
lee,
the
probation
officer,
who
convinced
him,
who
told
him
for
the
first
time
that
such
an
order
had
been
entered,
that
he
was
on
probation
and
that
he
was
to
--
to
report
and
he
said
mr.
lee
convinced
him
that
the
sentence
was
somehow
rather
legal.
mr.
bennett
boskey
nothing
or
whatsoever,
sir.
well,
as
a
result
of
this
chain
of
events
for
two
years
approximately,
he
was
out
on
probation
and
under
the
surveillance
with
the
probation
officer.
he
was
then
brought
back
into
court
for
an
alleged
violation
of
probation.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir.
mr.
bennett
boskey
in
november
of
1952.
mr.
bennett
boskey
as
i
understand
his
allegations
and
they
seemed
in
this
case
to
be
correct
and
undisputed,
he
says
that
at
the
time
he
was
to
be
released,
he
was
told
to
get
in
touch
with
the
federal
probation
officer,
mr.
lee.
he
did
so
and
thereupon
his
probation
surveillance
began
and
he
kept
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
for
a
period
of
two
years,
he
regularly
reported
to
the
probation
officer.
and
he
was
arrested
almost
two
full
years
later
after
the
surveillance.
he
was
arrested
for
an
alleged
violation
of
probation.
in
his
motion
to
vacate,
he
says
this
was
because
of
the
excessive
drinking.
mr.
bennett
boskey
excessive
drinking.
he
came
back
before
the
judge
in
september
of
1954.
and
on
that
occasion,
again,
he
had
no
counsel.
again,
the
judge
did
not
advise
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
have
counsel
appointed,
although
the
united
states
attorney
did
say
to
--
to
him,
"you
understand,
you
do
have
a
right
to
counsel,
don't
you?"
and
he
said
"yes."
and
then
the
united
states
attorney
said,
"you
understand
--
is
it
your
desire
to
waive
that
right?"
he
said,
"yes."
mr.
bennett
boskey
if
--
if
you're
reading
from
the
court
order,
mr.
justice
reed,
that's
what
the
court
order
says.
i
say
the
transcript
is
oddly
inconsistent
with
it
and
that's
a
fictitious
and
false
entry
in
the
court
order.
the
transcript
appears
at
page
11
of
the
record
and
i
reproduce
it
at
page
14
of
my
brief.
and
this
is
just
another
one
of
those
things
that
the
government
in
its
brief.i
think
at
page
18,
it
says,
“it's
a
technical
irregularity.”
this
case
is
full
of
technical
irregularities
including
these
false
entries
in
the
orders
that
had
been
entered
by
the
clerk
and
the
judge
in
this
case.
now,
i
spend
a
moment.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
on
page
11
purports
to
be
a
complete
transcript
of
what
occurred
on
september
21,
1954.
the
--
the
court
reporter
certificate
at
the
bottom
so
state.
now,
comparing
that
transcript,
putting
it
aside
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir.
now,
putting
that
transcript
side
by
side
with
the
court
order
entered
on
page
12
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
if
the
stenographer
doesn't
take
down
the
advise
given
by
the
court,
if
the
judge
gives
it
that
--
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
--
to
counsel.
and
the
question
that
the
judge
asks,
if
the
judge
asks
it,
whether
the
defendant
desires
to
have
a
counsel
appointed,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
system
of
reporting
is
entirely
breaking
--
broken
down.
those
questions
are
crucial
under
johnson
and
zerbst.
they're
crucial
under
the
federal
rules
and
if
reporter
is
there
to
take
down
anything,
i
would
assumed
he's
there,
certain
to
take
down
that.
mr.
bennett
boskey
some
questions,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
--
were
asked.
but
nobody
advised
the
defendant
that
--
or
asked
the
defendant
whether
he
desired
to
have
counsel
appointed
by
the
court
and
the
recital
to
that
affect
in
the
order
is
false.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
but
nobody
said
to
him
at
least
of
all
the
court,
that
the
court
would
appoint
counsel
for
him
if
he
was
unable
to
retain
counsel.
now,
going
down
just
a
little
bit
further
down
the
page,
on
page
12
of
the
record,
there's
a
another
recital.
the
court
having
asked
the
defendant
whether
he
has
anything
to
say,
why
judgement
should
not
be
pronounced.
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
transcripts
that
the
court
did
know
such
thing.
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
transcript
that
somebody
in
the
district
of
minnesota
is
using
a
bunch
of
forms
where
they're
printed
or
typewritten
or
otherwise
to
make
it
appear,
at
least
in
this
case,
to
make
it
appear
the
things
that
are
going
on
in
the
district
court
courtroom
that
never
in
fact
occurred.
mr.
bennett
boskey
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
sure
make
that
mandatory.
there's
a
recent
opinion
cited
in
my
brief
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
couch
case
which
traces
the
entire
history
of
that
right
and
says,
it's
one
of
the
most
sacred
rights
known
to
the
common
law.
apparently,
in
the
district
of
minnesota,
it
isn't.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
i
don't
know
from
this
record
whether
it
was
inadvertent
or
deliberate.
i
don't
know
from
this
record
whether
it
occurred
once
in
the
pollard
case,
in
this
district
or
whether
it
occurs
in
dozens
of
cases.
i'm
saying
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
deliberate
or
inadvertent.
but
if
this
was
not
the
proper
way,
the
criminal
law
to
be
administered
and
in
fact
if
it's
a
disgrace
for
the
criminal
law
to
be
administered
in
this
way.
and
that
if
ever
a
case
came
along,
it
calls
for
this
court
to
exercise
a
supervisory
jurisdiction
and
see
to
it
that
the
law
was
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
this
is
such
a
case.
now,
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
if
you
look
at
my
brief,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
on
page
15
in
the
footnote
4.
mr.
bennett
boskey
15,
in
footnote
4.
i
have
referred
to
one
of
the
forms
that
was
used
here,
criminal
form
no.
25d
and
if
you
will
refer
to
the
original
record
on
file
in
this
court,
you
will
find
that
that
is
a
printed
form.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
read
that
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
no,
sir.
i
think
that
was
typed
in
on
--
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
isn't
printed
in,
it
was
typed
in.
mr.
bennett
boskey
my
recollection
is
that
the
original
record
shows
it
was
typed
in.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
was
--
it
appears
to
me
it
was
somebody's
ad
hoc
petition.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
appears
to
have
been.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
bennett
boskey
that's
here
on
the
files
of
this
court
from
which
this
transcript
was
printed.
well,
in
my
brief,
i
have
set
forth
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir.
they
appear
to
have
certified
up
the
original
papers
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
whether
duplicates
remain
in
minnesota,
but
i
think
you
have
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
it
appears
to
be
printed
for
general
distribution.
and
it's
a
form
that
obviously
can
make
improperly
handle
the
cases
as
appeared
to
be
properly
handled,
unless
there's
a
transcript
available
to
contradict
the
form
as
happened
to
occur
in
this
case.
now
in
my
brief,
i
have
explained
why
we
think
that
if
our
interpretation
of
the
record
is
correct,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
constitution
stood
as
a
bar
for
his
sentence.
the
government
doesn't
quarrel
with
our
interpretation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
the
applicability
of
ex
parte
lange,
at
least
the
government
doesn't
in
its
brief.
if
we
are
correct
about
the
proper
interpretation
on
what
happened
on
the
morning
of
october
3,
1952.
similarly,
i
think
the
government
has
not
in
its
brief
quarrels
with
the
proposition
that
if
we're
correct
that
on
the
morning
of
october
3,
1952,
the
judge
met
to
make
a
final
disposition
of
the
case
then
it
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
for
a
sentence
to
have
been
imposed
on
this
man
two
years
later.
mr.
bennett
boskey
well,
it's
comforting
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
it's
comforting
to
know
that
the
due
process
clause
is
there
to
protect
people
against
circumstances
of
this
kind.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
indeed,
i
think
you're
--
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
bennett
boskey
i
shall
indeed.
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
if
i'm
wrong
about
what
happened
on
october
3,
1952
and
they
think
i
am
wrong.
then
this
case
should
be
judged
in
the
following
light.
the
case
should
be
looked
at
as
if
nothing
really
happened
on
october
3,
1952.
the
order
added
was
nullity
and
the
case
was
just
left
hanging
in
suspense
for
two
years
until
mr.
pollard
was
brought
back
in
for
violation
of
probation
and
then
a
sentence
of
two
years
imprisonment
was
imposed
upon.
now,
among
the
ways
in
which
the
petitioner
deals
with
that
question
has
been
to
say
that
a
delay
otherwise
unjustifiable.
a
delay
of
two
years,
approximately
two
full
years,
from
the
time
of
plea
of
guilty
to
the
time
of
imposition
of
sentence,
it's
wholly
unreasonable
and
goes
beyond
the
limits
permitted
either
by
the
federal
rules
which
required
that
sentence
shall
be
imposed
without
unreasonable
delay
or
by
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
the
constitution.
in
order
to
make
the
latter
argument
which
is
a
constitutional
argument,
it's
necessary
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sentencing
portion
of
the
criminal
proceeding
is
in
fact
part
of
a
trial
within
the
meaning
of
the
speedy
trial
guarantee.
and
we
say
in
the
brief
that
our
position
on
that
is
(inaudible)
by
two
things.
first,
what
we
know
about
the
great
purpose
of
the
speedy
trial
provision
which
is
largely
to
protect
defendants
from
being
subjected
to
vexatious
and
oppressive
delays
by
what
an
old
decision
calls
the
ministers
of
justice.
so,
we
say
the
purpose
is
in
favor
of
that
instruction.
in
addition,
we
say
that
the
text
is
in
favor
of
that
instruction
and
the
example
that
i've
used
in
the
brief
is
this,
the
phrase
in
the
constitution
is
a
phrase
referring
to
speedy
and
public
trial.
we
say
that
the
word
trial
when
interpreted
with
reference
to
the
word
speedy,
obviously
must
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
trial
when
interpreted
with
reference
with
the
word
public,
since
the
two
adjectives
both
immediately
proceed
the
same
noun.
we
say
that
if
a
judge,
if
a
federal
judge
were
to
sentence
a
man
in
a
secret
session,
even
though
the
trial
had
been
held
in
open
session
that
that
secret
sentencing
would
violate
the
public
trial
provision
of
the
constitution
and
that
it
would
violate
it
because
the
word
trial
textually
includes
the
sentencing
portion
of
the
proceeding.
for
the
same
reason,
we
say
that
the
word
speedy
when
we
are
using
the
word
--
the
phrase
speedy
trial,
we
say
that
the
word
speedy
trial
include
the
sentencing
portion
of
the
proceeding.
and
as
to
the
one
case
the
government
relies
on
to
the
--
apparently
which
the
government
looks
to
or
held
in
the
other
direction,
namely,
miller
and
aderhold,
i
think
in
288
u.s.,
we
say
that
there
were
several
distinguishing
circumstances
that
make
it
inapplicable
here.
one
is
that
the
length
of
time
involved
was
considerably
shorter,
namely,
the
lapse
of
time
between
the
time
of
sentence
--
between
the
time
of
conviction
and
the
time
of
sentence
was
only
six
months.
two,
we
say
also
that
in
that
case
and
possibly
for
the
very
reason
i
have
just
given,
no
question
was
raised
by
the
defendant
as
to
the
speedy
trial
clause.
now
obviously,
these
are
matters
of
degree.
some
period
of
time
would
not
be
long
enough
to
get
into
a
problem
under
the
speedy
trial
clause
or
this
will
be
certainly
long
enough.
and
we
say
that
the
two
years
for
the
last
year
when
the
fault
was
wholly
resting
upon
both
the
government
and
the
u.s.
attorney
and
not
upon
petitioner,
we
say
that
those
two
years
made
it
too
long
and
that
the
just
disposition
of
the
case
when
petitioner
was
brought
back
to
court
on
september
of
1954
would
have
been
to
enter
the
order
we
asked
to
be
entered
now,
namely,
an
order
that
the
court
should
not
have
made
any
sentence
imposed
any
sentence
in
september
of
1954.
and
that
that
order
is
important
to
petitioner
because
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
morgan
and
fiswick
cases,
future
civil
rights
may
be
affected
and
subsequent
punishments
in
the
event
with
a
future
crime
may
be
lengthier
if
this
sentencing
order
is
to
stand
even
though
petitioner
has
now
served
the
sentence.
mr.
bennett
boskey
his
motion
to
vacate,
mr.
justice
harlan,
alleges
something
not
quite
that.
it
alleges
that
he
knew
--
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir.
mr.
bennett
boskey
yes,
sir,
an
allegation
of
that
character
is
also
in
the
motion
to
vacate
at
page
14
of
the
record.
mr.
bennett
boskey
it's
preceded
by
a
paragraph
in
which
he
tells
about
his
initial
conversation
with
mr.
lee
when
he
first
got
out
of
stillwater.
and
he
says
that
at
that
time
--
he
said
that
mr.
lee
undertook
to
and
succeeded
in
convincing
petitioner
with
the
sentence
of
three
years
probation
was
legal.
petitioner's
being
unversed
in
law
in
desiring
to
be
cooperative
in
every
respect
tells
at
that
time
that
he
was
forced
to
accept
mr.
lee's
explanation.
that's
what
the
record
shows
in
his
motion
to
vacate.
and
then
it
deals
with
this
