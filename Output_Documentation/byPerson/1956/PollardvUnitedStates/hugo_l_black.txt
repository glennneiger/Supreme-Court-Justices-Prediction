justice
hugo
l.
black
was
a
lawyer
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
in
the
absence
of
his
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
the
government
admits
they
can't
do
it
that
way?
does
the
government
admit
that
they
couldn't
do
it
in
the
absence
of
counsel?
is
there
anything
in
johnson
and
zerbst
that
--
that
restricts
the
holding
to
the
precise
time
when
the
man
has
evidence
to
being
heard
against
the
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
supposed
it
does
not
show
that,
why
would
johnson
and
zerbst
not
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
johnson
and
zerbst
say
that?
it
has
to
work
to
the
prejudice
of
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
lawsuit
out
of
something,
the
court
did
in
absence
of
counsel.
and
johnston
and
zerbst
unlike
betts
and
brady
as
i
recall
it,
is
not
limited,
the
cases
in
which
they
have
prejudicial.
the
constitution
says
as
the
court
in
that
case,
the
man
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
then
as
i
understand
it
that
if
he
honestly,
if
he
intelligently
and
knowingly
waived
not
having
had
counsel
there
and
because
he
gets
a
benefit,
you're
claiming
that
part
of
johnston
and
zerbst.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you'd
be
asserting
it
if
you're
saying
that
he
could
claim
the
benefit
of
this
--
what
was
done
even
though
he
had
no
counsel?
in
other
words,
you
--
you're
relying
in
part
there,
i
should
suppose
on
the
theory
that
a
man
although
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
can
waive
it
if
he
doesn't
knowingly
and
intelligently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
seen
the
original
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
is
that
the
original
record?
it'll
be
claimed
what
--
that
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
must
have
been
printed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
should
mean
it's
a
certified
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
forms
have
been
sent
out
all
over
the
country?
