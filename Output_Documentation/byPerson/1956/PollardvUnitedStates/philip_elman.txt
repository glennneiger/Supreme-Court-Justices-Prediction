mr.
philip
elman
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
say
at
once
that
the
government
does
not
regard
proceedings
in
this
case
as
a
model
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
unfortunate
and
regrettable
and
to
the
extent
that
any
responsibility
for
what
happened
here
rests
upon
the
united
states
attorney,
busy
though
he
may
have
been
with
other
matters
failing
--
failing
to
call
to
the
judges'
attention
that
he
had
neglected
to
impose
sentence
on
mr.
pollard.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
--
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
the
government
believe
that
they
sentence
is
as
mr.
boskey
has
charged
in
his
brief
that
here,
the
victim
of
a
deliberate,
disgraceful,
oppressive,
arbitrary,
unfair
combination
of
actions,
i
would
be
here
to
confess
adversary.
mr.
philip
elman
the
government's
position
here
is
that
the
events
that
took
place
in
the
district
court
on
october
3rd,
1952
were
invalid.
they
were
defective.
it
was
not
a
lawful
sentence
that
was
imposed
at
that
time.
we
concede
error
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case.
but
what
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
don't
wish
--
i
don't
wish
to
--
to
quibble
about
the
word
fairness
because
i
think
fairness
involves
the
making
of
a
moral
judgement
as
to
all
the
parties
concerned
including
the
judge,
the
government
officials,
the
clerk
as
well
as
the
defendant.
now,
i
--
i
will
certainly
recognize
--
certainly
admit.
i
am
not
trying
to
--
to
view
in
anyway
to
resist
any
characterization
adverse
to
the
government
as
to
what
happened
here.
but
i
--
i
do
think
in
fairness
to
the
judge
who
is
the
key
figure
in
this
episode
in
the
case.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
be
willing
to
assume
that
what
happened
on
the
initial
hearing
was
unfair
to
the
defendant
in
a
sense
that
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
him
was
illegal
and
that
the
procedures
that
attended
that
imposition
of
sentence
were
not
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
law.
i
--
i
--
well,
that
--
that's
the
starting
point
in
this
case
but
the
precise
issue
which
is
before
your
honor
is
whether
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
on
mr.
pollard
on
september
21st,
1954,
almost
two
years
later,
was
a
valid
sentence.
now,
mr.
boskey
does
not
argue
that
the
irregularities,
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
rules,
the
absence
of
the
defendant
from
the
courtroom
when
the
probation
sentence
was
imposed,
the
absence
of
a
lawyer
then,
he
does
argue
that
those
defects,
those
invalidities,
those
irregularities,
those
instance
of
unfairness,
if
one
chooses
to
call
them
that,
vitiate
the
judgement
of
1954.
his
argument
is
that
what
happened
on
the
morning
of
october
3rd,
1952,
prior
to
the
united
states
attorney's
raising
the
question
of
the
sentence,
his
argument
is
not
that
the
judge
forgot
to
impose
sentence
to
an
oversight
or
for
someone
other
reason.
his
argument
is
that
the
judge
made
a
final
conclusive
definitive
disposition
of
the
case
about
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
that
he
imposed
the
sentence
in
that
time.
mr.
philip
elman
may
i
--
may
i
put
the
matter
in
some
perspective,
sir?
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
pollard
had
pleaded
guilty
on
september
8th,
1952,
three
weeks
earlier.
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
probation
order
so
that
a
preparation
--
for
investigation
and
for
the
preparation
of
a
pre-sentencing
report.
the
morning
of
october
3rd,
1952,
the
matters
--
one
of
several
coming
before
the
judge
that
morning,
the
matter
comes
up
before
judge
joyce.
judge
joyce
was
an
experienced
federal
judge.
he'd
been
appointed
to
the
district
court
in
1932.
he
had
imposed
literally
thousands
of
sentences,
i'm
sure,
in
his
career
on
the
bench.
the
defendant
at
no
time
in
that
colloquy
withdrew
his
plea
of
guilty.
there
was
nothing
that
judge
--
judge
joyce
said
that
implied
that
--
that
the
judge
intended
to
acquit
the
defendant.
mr.
boskey
argues
that
this
is
a
final
disposition
of
the
case
that
--
that
it
is
the
sentence.
now,
the
--
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
required
that
the
sentence
constitute
an
adjudication.
on
the
petitioner's
view,
this
is
an
adjudication
of
guilt
or
is
an
adjudication
of
innocence.
the
judge
doesn't
say.presumably,
this
is
--
he
--
this
is
a
judgement
of
conviction
that
on
the
petitioner's
view,
the
judge
was
--
was
convicting
that
--
that
the
defendant
was
accepting
the
plea
of
guilty
but
he
was
saying
to
the
defendant
go
and
sin
no
more.
there
would
be
no
penalty,
no
fine,
no
imprisonment,
no
probation,
no
penalty
of
any
kind.
and
it's
argued
that
that
was
within
the
judges
lawful
power
to
make
such
a
disposition
of
the
sentence
or
disposition
of
the
case.
and
that,
on
the
petitioner's
view,
when
the
united
states
attorney
an
hour
or
two
later
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
certainly,
--
mr.
philip
elman
our
position
is
that
the
intention
of
the
judge
was
not
clear.
our
position
is
that
the
judge
made
an
unequivocal,
uncertain,
incomplete
disposition
of
the
case
so
that
the
burden
is
not
on
us
to
show
that
he
made
a
--
a
definitive
disposition
of
the
case
at
that
time.
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner.
mr.
philip
elman
and
our
suggestion
is,
sir,
that
the
--
that
the
judge
in
saying
to
the
defendant,
don't
get
in
trouble
anymore,
don't
come
back
here
again,
that
is
all.
but
that
was
an
incomplete
disposition
of
the
case
because
the
judge
had
failed
to
impose
sentence.
now,
it
--
it
would
have
been
a
most
unprecedented
thing
for
a
federal
judge
accepting
a
plea
of
guilty,
convicting
a
defendant
to
say
or
to
hold
that
he
would
not
impose
any
--
any
restraint
at
all
on
the
defendant.
not
impose
probation
would
release
him
without
any
strings
attached
completely
without
--
we've
--
we've
been
unable
to
discover
any
instance
in
--
in
the
federal
law
in
which
any
federal
judge
has
made
such
a
disposition
as
its
certain
was
made
in
this
case
ordinarily
where
a
judge
is
satisfied
that
the
defendant
has
sufficiently
atone
for
--
for
his
offense.
the
judge
will
impose
some
kind
nominal
sentence
such
as
a
dollar
fine
or
an
hour
probation
or
something
of
the
sort.
now,
there's
--
at
least
--
mr.
philip
elman
it's
not
conclusive
here
at
all,
no.
no,
but
what
i'm
--
the
issue
in
this
case
as
it's
opposed
is
a
very
narrow
one.
and
mr.
--
mr.
boskey
recognized
that
it's
--
it's
a
simple
one
of
interpreting
what
happened
when
the
defendant
was
before
judge
joyce
on
the
morning
of
october
3rd
and
it's
a
question
of
interpreting
the
record.
now,
his
--
mr.
philip
elman
all
right.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
two
pages.
mr.
philip
elman
it
start
--
it
starts
on
page
4,
middle
of
the
page
and
it
goes
on
at
the
top
of
page
6.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
anything
that
i
can
point
to
that
says
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
he
is
not
finished
with
the
case.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
the
judge
thought
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
case
was
finished
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
if
mr.
pollard
behaved
himself
and
didn't
come
back
to
--
to
his
courtroom.
now,
that
leaves
--
open
the
question
whether
the
judge
intended
to
make
a
disposition
of
the
case
so
complete
that
he
deprived
himself
of
the
power
which
he
purported
to
exercise
within
an
hour
or
so
of
putting
this
man
on
probation.
now,
is
it
conceivable
--
is
it
conceivable
that
--
that
judge
joyce
would
have
taken
an
action
which
is
unique,
unprecedented
as
to
which
there
is
at
least
a
serious
question
as
to
his
power
to
do
or
to
make
a
disposition
of
the
case
by
--
by
releasing
a
--
a
defendant
and
telling
him
to
--
to
go
without
any
strings
attached?
is
it
conceivable
an
experienced
federal
judge
would
have
done
that,
would
have
taken
such
an
extraordinary
action
without
at
least
explaining
why
he
was
taking
it?
is
it
conceivable
that
within
a
matter
of
an
hour
or
two
at
the
most,
he
would
completely
reverse
himself
to
say
i'm
putting
a
man
on
probation
without
explaining
why
he
was
reversing
himself?
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
sir,
this
--
this
case
comes
out
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
since
--
since
the
government
conceded
that
the
probation
order
was
illegal
since
the
defendant
was
in
the
courtroom
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
we,
this
case,
it
has
--
it
has
comes
here
--
comes
here
on
--
on
the
record
which
particularly
meager
since
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
precisely
the
question.
now,
if
the
petitioner
is
right
as
to
that,
he's
right
as
to
everything
else
whether
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
judge
made
a
final,
definitive,
complete
disposition
of
the
case
when
mr.
pollard
was
in
the
courtroom,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
what
he
did
afterwards
was
legal
or
illegal.
he
was
through
with
the
case.
he
had
imposed
sentence.
mr.
philip
elman
so
that's
the
issue
to
which
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
brief
of
--
of
mr.
boskey
were
addressed.
now,
none
would
like
to
respond
to
it
by
saying
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
elman
it
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
--
it
was
a
definitive
action.
the
question
as
whether
it
was
legal
or
whether
it
was
illegal.
mr.
philip
elman
yes.
mr.
philip
elman
it
would
have
been
clear.
i
--
i
--
we
would
not
be
defending
that.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
there
were
any
--
at
any
period
after
the
expiration
of
three-year
probationary
period,
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
defendant
hadn't
already
served
the
sentence
even
though
it
was
an
illegal
sentence
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
because
the
judge
had
purported
to
put
him
on
probation
for
three
years.now
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
no,
this
is
--
no,
sir.
i
beg
you
pardon,
sir.
the
original
probation
order
of
october
3rd,
1952
was
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
but
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
--
you
were
focused
--
mr.
philip
elman
he
was.
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
disagree
with
the
word
you
said
mr.
chief
justice.
what
happened
on
october
3rd,
1952
was
illegal.
but
the
law
is
also
clear
that
when
there's
an
illegal
sentence,
that
doesn't
mean
the
defendant
goes
free
and
he's
not
to
be
punished.
the
law
is
well
sound
that
an
illegal
sentence
can
be
corrected.
and
rule
35
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
says
that
in
--
in
haec
verba
that
the
court
may
correct
an
illegal
sentence
at
anytime.
this
court
held
in
the
case
--
the
leading
case
of
miller
against
aderhold
and
it
was
--
it's
been
applied
many
times.
the
most
recent
one
was
in
the
bozza
case
in
330
u.s.
in
which
mr.
justice
black
wrote
for
the
court.
the
principle
is
well
sound
that
if
the
defect
is
one,
which
--
which
is
susceptible
of
correction,
it
can
be
corrected
thereafter.
now,
i
agree
that
--
that
circumstances
may
be
such
in
a
particular
case
that
would
be
unfair,
unjust
and
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
to
bring
him
back
years
after
the
event
in
the
post
--
illegal
sentence
on
him
simply
because
there
was
an
illegal
prior
sentence.
the
defects
may
be
one
which
he
can
waive
or
that
--
or
that
the
intervening
circumstances
may
--
may
make
it
unfair
and
unjust
with
post-sentence.
but
in
this
case,
the
--
the
hardship
under
which
mr.
harwood
labored
for
--
for
a
period
of
two
years
was
that
he
was
under
probation,
an
illegal
probation
order.
the
only
condition
of
which
was
the
--
to
conduct
himself
as
a
law
abiding
industrious
citizen.
now,
what
the
judge
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
something
--
mr.
philip
elman
october
1952,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
page
7
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
terms
of
--
it
is
further
ordered
that
during
the
period
of
probation,
the
defendant
shall
conduct
himself
as
a
law
abiding
industrious
citizen
and
observe
such
conditions
of
probation
as
the
court
may
prescribe.
the
court
did
not
prescribe
any
others.
so
that
was
--
that
was
the
--
the
hardship.
mr.
philip
elman
that
was
the
illegal
act
of
the
judge.
now,
the
question
is
by
reason
of
that
illegality,
did
he
deprive
the
court,
not
merely
himself,
but
did
he
deprive
a
federal
court
of
the
power
which
had
normally
possesses
to
correct
an
error
of
sentencing?
was
--
was
this
probationary
order
which
the
defendant
knew
about,
he
says
several
times,
not
only
in
petition
for
certiorari
but
in
his
2255
motion
is
in
forma
pauperis
motion.
he
knew
about
that.
he
talked
it
over
with
the
probation
officer
and
he
decided
it
was
in
his
best
interest
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
and
not
to
raise
the
question.
had
he
raised
the
question
immediately,
the
day
he
left
the
states
prison,
if
he
had
--
if
he
had
gone
back
to
federal
district
court
and
said,
“but
judge
joyce,
this
probationary
order
is
invalid
for
reasons
a,
b,
c
and
d.”
mr.
philip
elman
on
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
on
page
--
mr.
philip
elman
not
on
the
day
that
he
was
--
it
was
surrounded
by
(inaudible)
in
prison.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
on
the
day
he
was
released
from
prison
which
was
november
26,
1952,
less
than
two
months
later.
mr.
philip
elman
if
he
had
come
back
in
november
1952,
the
district
judge,
no
one
would
be
arguing
seriously
that
that
--
it
was
such
a
lapse
of
time.
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
don't
think
he
should
have
gone
back.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
think
he
should
have
gone
back
to
the
district
court.
all
we're
saying
is
that
he
--
that
--
that
the
district
court's
power
to
correct
the
sentence
can
hardly
be
deemed
to
have
been
lost
by
reason
of
this
expiration
of
time,
this
two
period,
for
which
mr.
pollard
himself
can
--
can
take
some
degree
of
responsibility.
that's
all
we're
saying.
mr.
philip
elman
the
maximum
is
five
years.
mr.
philip
elman
october
3rd,
1952.
mr.
philip
elman
october
3rd,
1952.
mr.
philip
elman
he
could
have
been
brought
in
at
any
time
prior
to
the
expiration
of
five-year
period.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
would
like
to
say
in
all
fairness
to
judge
joyce,
who
--
who
died
earlier
this
year,
that
the
start
--
that
--
that
what
happened
in
this
case,
the
unfortunate
series
of
events
that
followed
arose
from
feelings
of
--
of
leniency
and
compassion
which
the
judge
held
for
this
man
when
he
was
brought
before
him.
here
is
pollard
who
had
pleaded
guilty
to
a
felony
punishable
up
to
five
years
in
prison.
he
was
in
the
state
prison
at
the
time.
he
had
a
prison
record.
there
aren't
very
many
federal
judges
who
would
have
--
who
would
have
let
him
go
without
some
kind
of
penalty.
judge
joyce
wanted
to
--
wanted
to
give
this
man
a
chance.
he
was
--
he
was
impressed
by
the
--
by
the
record
the
man
had
made
while
he's
a
state
prisoner.
he
has
worked
with
alcoholics
anonymous.
he
--
he
encouraged
them
to
--
to
continue
his
work
with
that
organization.
and
he
--
he
was
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
rehabilitate
himself
and
that's
--
now,
as
we
read
the
record,
we
maybe
wrong
about
it.
it's
--
it's
conceivable
that
pressures
were
put
on
the
judge
thereafter
and
so
forth
as
we
read
the
record.
what
happened
here
was
the
judge
simply
forgot
to
impose
the
sentence
of
putting
the
man
on
probation.
now,
that
was
a
human
--
a
human
error
for
--
for
which
he
--
we
don't
think
he's
to
be
condemned.
it
was
an
oversight.
it
should
have
been
called
to
his
attention
by
those
in
the
courtroom
had
they
been
more
attentive.
when
the
matter
was
raised
an
hour
or
so
later,
judge
joyce
didn't
have
before
him
the
transcript
of
his
earlier
remarks.
the
courtroom
--
the
court
reporter
was
still
--
still
on
the
job.
and
--
and
judge
joyce
must
have
been
thinking
that
he
had
--
he
had
put
the
man
on
probation
because
he
was
just
merely
making
explicit
of
what
he
had
already
made
that
influence
it
because
it's
just
inconceivable
to
us
at
least
that
the
federal
judge
knowing
that
elementary
fundamental
requirement,
you
can't
impose
a
sentence
on
a
defendant
when
he
isn't
there.
to
us,
it's
incredible
that
this
judge
would
have
imposed
the
sentence
on
the
man
in
his
absence.
mr.
philip
elman
if
he
really
thought
that
he
was
imposing
sentence
for
the
first
time.
mr.
philip
elman
it
--
it
isn't
in
this
record
because
these
other
matters
of
course
are
not
--
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
if
the
court
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
court
wishes
to
get
--
have
that
--
have
a
transcript
to
those
matters,
i
believe
it
could
be
furnished
to
the
court.
although
it's
not
--
i
happen
to
have
seen
it
but
i
won't
answer
your
question
because
it
is
outside
of
the
record,
unless
you
ask
me
--
desire
me
to.
mr.
philip
elman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i'm
under
--
i
--
i
have
seen
that
transcript,
sir,
and
i
know
what's
in
it
and
if
you
should
like
me
to
answer
that
question,
i
would
tell
you.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
no
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
if
the
court
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
to
carry
your
thought
further,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
should
disagree
with
the
government
and
--
and
of
all
the
petitioners'
contentions,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
you
to
condemn
the
judge.
it
would
only
be
necessary
for
you
to
hold
on
the
basis
of
your
reading
of
the
record
that
prior
to
the
imposition
of
this
invalid
probationary
sentence
that
prior
to
that
time,
judge
joyce
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
going
to
dispose
of
this
case
once
and
for
all
completely
that
he
was
going
to
take
him
an
unprecedented
extraordinary
action
of
not
imposing
any
sentence
without
saying
so
many
words
that
he
was
doing
so
without
making
a
judgment
of
guilt
or
innocence
as
the
--
as
the
rules
required.
now,
our
position
simply
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
he
was
inconclusive.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
mr.
philip
elman
and
if
the
court
is
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
court
is
satisfied
that
judge
joyce,
although
accepting
the
plea
of
guilty,
convicted
the
man
but
was
releasing
him
entirely
without
probation,
without
any
other
penalty.
if
that
--
if
that
is
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
record,
then
of
course
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
the
sentence
of
1954
was
illegal.
now,
if
i
may
add
one
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
suggested
earlier
a
response
to
a
question
that
there's
a
serious
question
as
to
the
power
of
a
judge
to
do
that.
mr.
philip
elman
we
have
not
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
have
not
discussed
it
because
we
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that's
what
the
judge
in
this
case
did.
but
if
--
but
to
answer
your
question,
in
ex
parte
united
states,
in
242
u.s.,
1916,
this
court
held
that
a
judge
--
a
federal
judge
had
no
inherent
power
to
suspend
this
sentence
or
release
a
prisoner
on
good
behavior.
it
took
--
the
court
said
--
this
court
said
that
only
congress
could
empower
the
federal
judges
to
take
such
action.
that
power
was
given
to
the
--
to
the
court
by
the
probation
act
in
1925.
the
probation
act
which
is
set
out
in
the
briefs,
says
that
upon
a
--
upon
judgment
of
conviction,
the
judges
under
an
obligation
either
to
impose
sentence
or
to
suspend
imposition
of
sentence
in
either
event,
he
may,
if
he
sees
that
--
put
the
defendant
on
probation
up
to
five
years.
now,
the
probation
act
does
not
say
that
the
--
that
a
federal
judge
after
conviction
may
release
a
man
without
probation.
we
have
not
attempted
to
argue
that
he
cannot
in
this
case
because
on
our
constructional
record
and
we
may
be
wrong
about
it.
on
our
constructional
record,
we
don't
think
the
judge
was
purporting
to
exercise
that
power.
but
we
do
think,
the
question
of
power
is
relevant
in
construing
what
he
did
because
if
this
judge
--
as
every
judge
and
federal
prosecutor
know,
if
--
if
this
--
if
they
release
without
probation,
without
imprisonment
or
fine,
it
is
unheard
of
if
it's
something
as
to
which
there
may
be
serious
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
the
judge
to
do.
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
--
that
this
judge
were
--
were
for
some
reason
--
reason
doing
it
for
mr.
pollard
when
he
had
never
done
it
before,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
he
never
did
it
thereafter.
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
would
have
said
something
as
to
why
he
was
doing
it?
and
if
had
taken
such
unusual
action
which
is
--
which
might
perhaps
be
beyond
his
power,
isn't
it
also
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
--
that
he
would
stick
to
it
and
wouldn't
change
his
mind
within
an
hour
or
so?
mr.
philip
elman
he
wasn't
told
that
he
had
an
imposed
sentence.
all
the
united
states
attorney
said
to
him
was,
this
is
on
page
6
of
the
record,
going
back
to
the
matter
of
thomas
e.
pollard
who
appeared
this
morning,
i
didn't
quite
understand
that
clearly.
is
there
to
be
a
probationary
period
after
his
release
from
stillwater
or
any
type
of
sentencing?
united
states
attorney
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
he
was
asking.
this
--
the
united
states
attorney
is
saying,
"i
didn't
understand
what
you
did,
your
honor."
for
--
for
all
we
know,
united
states
attorney
may
have
been
busy
with
--
with
other
matters
at
the
time
and
--
or
either
he
wasn't
listening
or
if
he
had
listened,
he
wasn't
sure
of
his
--
of
what
had
occurred.
let
me
--
that
--
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
we
don't
think
--
we
don't
think
that
we're
relying
on
any
unreal
presumptions
as
to
what
--
what
judges
customarily
do
in
sentencing.
what
matter
is
we
think
that
if
--
if
judge
joyce
had
been
told
by
the
united
states
attorney
that
he
had
not
imposed
any
sentence
in
this
case,
we
doubt
very
much
that
judge
joyce
would
have
--
would
have
just
said,
“well,
the
sentence
is
to
commence
the
expiration
of
--
of
the
stillwater
term.”
is
it
--
is
it
a
presumption
to
attribute
to
a
federal
judge
a
desire
to
--
to
comply
with
a
fundamental
requirement
of
--
of
law
which
is
known
to
every
law
student
that
you
can
impose
a
sentence
on
the
defendant
when
he
isn't
there?
mr.
philip
elman
well,
your
honor,
i
understands
that
we
--
we
admit
that
what
--
what
happened
there
was
not
a
judgment
of
sentence
which
was
lawful.
i
mean
we're
not
--
we're
not
arguing
that
that
was
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
the
disposition
of
the
case,
aren't
it?
it
is
--
it's
the
government
which
is
relying
on
these
irregularities
in
1952
to
justify
the
correction
of
the
sentence
which
occurred
in
1954.
and
--
