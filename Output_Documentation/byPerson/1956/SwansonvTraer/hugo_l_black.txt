justice
hugo
l.
black
after
judge
knoch's
opinion
and
judgment,
did
you
ask
for
opportunity
to
amend,
so
as
to
meet
what
he
considered
to
be
the
inadequate
allegations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
sufficiently
alleged
that.
what
would
be
your
position
on
realignment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
this
were
found
that
there
was
control
by
the
director
--
certain
directors
that
is
against
the
interests
of
the
corporation,
what
would
be
your
view
then
as
to
realignment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been
affidavit
attached,
three
affidavits
attached
about
people
who
said
they
knew
it.
they
talked
to
them
and
they
had
said
they
would
not
file
a
suit
that
should
not
be
filed,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
--
you
would
say
that
that
affidavit
wouldn't
be
sufficient
then
because
it
failed
to
show
sufficient
facts
to
indicate
that
the
directors
were
not
exercising
an
honest
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference?

of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
express
upon
the
difficulty
of
these
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
just
read
judge
knoch's
motion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
read
his
opinion.
he
purports
and
not
to
be
ruling
on
what
you
say.
he
makes
no
finding
of
fact.
he
says
you
had
an
answer
and
withdrew
it
and
that
it's
submitted
to
him
on
complaint
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
briefs.
i
do
not
understand
how
we
can
go
beyond
that
in
connection
with
this
order.
there
were
findings
of
fact.
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
it
seems
to
me
and
maybe
properly
is
that
we
look
at
all
these
affidavits
and
so
forth
that
were
put
in
here,
even
though
the
only
rule
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
on
the
ground
that
he
stated
that
taking
up
the
allegations
of
complaint
one
by
one
is
--
wasn't
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
said
he
is
fully
informed
from
the
--
from
the
question
he
pleads,
he
said
you
withdrew
that
you
didn't
care
to
have
it.
you
didn't
accept
on
the
motion
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
this
cause
having
come
on
order
further
in
pretrial
conference
and
so
forth.
all
the
defendants
who
were
served
from
an
ally,
each
of
them
having
moved
even
though
answers
had
previously
been
file
that
the
complaint
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
after
we
--

justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
has
again
argued
with
the
counsel
having
permitted
to
have
motion
as
we
presented.
the
court
has
a
very
extensive
oral
argument,
thereupon
presented
for
both
in
having
read
written
briefs
by
--
or
said
defendants
counsel
haven't
fully
considered
the
same
and
hasn't
studied
them
thoroughly,
fully
advised
of
the
merit,
having
filed
a
memorandum
opinion,
he
dismissed
it
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
in
his
memorandum
opinion,
he
does
not
rest
on
the
evidence
as
i
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
rests
on
a
holding
if
the
complaint
doesn't
state
a
cause
of
action,
maybe
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
judge
knoch
had
ruled
on
that,
that
will
be
one
thing.
but
did
he
rule
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
say
to
you
that
i
don't
have
to
give
an
argument
with
my
brother
on
advance.
i'm
fully
familiar
with
that
rule.
i've
heard
that
before.
what
you
have
here
is
a
diversity
if
the
complaint
alleges
to
that
to
show
there
is
hostility
between
them
and,
or
if
it
would
have
shown
the
same
thing
or
that
it
is
whatever
it
takes,
or
it
--
it
would
be
the
same
thing
if
they'd
gone
through
what
judge
barnes
said
in
heard
evidence
and
had
a
fact
of
finding
of
such
things.
now,
where
do
you
have
here
anything
that
compels
us
to
say
to
what
judge
knoch
said
or
anybody
else
said
that
a
judge
could
not
rule
on
anything
except
that
the
complaint
wasn't
enough.
now,
if
it
be
true
that
there's
enough
in
their
complaint
to
show
the
kind
of
--
of
fighting
between
the
--
the
plaintiffs
and
the
directors
to
make
them
have
adverse
interest
and
of
course
there's
no
diversity
applied,
there
is
no
difference
to
the
party.
you
don't
have
a
diversity
necessary,
but
do
you
not
have
to
go
back
and
look
to
see
about
the
complaint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
heard
any
disagreement
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
have
heard
any
disagreement
between
people
about
that?
i
thought
the
disagreement
here
was
the
argument
or
you
claimed
that
it's
enough
to
show
from
this
record
that
there
is
an
adverse
interest
between
these
parties
and
they
claim
there's
not.
that's
basic
isn't
it
to
determining
whether
there's
diversity
of
jurisdiction.
of
course,
you
look
at
the
whole
records.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
might
look
at
all
the
evidence
of
both
sides
that
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
try
that
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
tried
it
out
on
that
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
if
they
were
not,
they
were
adverse
interest.
