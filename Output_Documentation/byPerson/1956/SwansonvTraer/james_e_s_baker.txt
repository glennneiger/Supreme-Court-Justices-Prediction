mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
thank
you,
sir.
mostly
my
argument
is
going
to
be
directed
to
the
question
that
mr.
doyle
says
he'll
talk
about
in
rebuttal.
but
i
speak
here
--
i
want
to
make
it
clear
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
thank
you,
sir.
i'd
appreciate
that
very
much.
i
speak
on
behalf
of
all
the
respondents,
except
the
chicago
north
shore
&
milwaukee
railway
company,
which
is
the
defendant
corporation
here
that
this
stockholder
suit
is
all
about,
and
mr.
busch,
the
general
counsel
of
the
corporation
is
here
in
court.
and
on
behalf
of
two
defendants
that
are
represented
by
mr.
gale,
and
mr.
gale
will
have
a
few
minutes
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
do
not.
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
we
--
let
me
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
let
me
start
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
let
me
start
off
--
not
the
way
i
intended
to
do
--
by
saying
that
the
railroad
in
this
action
has
tried
to
be
a
neutral.
they
are
a
professed
neutral.
they
haven't
been
taken
sides
with
us.
they
haven't
taken
sides
with
the
plaintiff.
and
our
basic
contention
is
that
under
the
rules
of
jurisdiction,
it's
only
when
they're
in
an
antagonistic
hands
or
when
they
take
sides
with
the
real
defendants,
as
the
lingual
of
the
cases
goes,
that
they
may
be
aligned
as
a
defendant
and
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
conceded
or
not,
but
it's
certainly
made
clear
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
and
it's
made
clear
by
their
brief,
and
i
think
that
we
can
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
made
the
contention
that
they
--
we
made
that
contention
in
the
district
court
and
we
made
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
think
that
the
pleadings
and
the
various
statements
of
counsel
that
were
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
indicate
their
professed
neutrality.
now,
as
mr.
doyle
stated,
the
real
question
here
is
whether
mr.
crummer
and
his
sister,
and
his
gardener
and
his
gardener's
wife,
all
of
whom
lived
in
nevada,
can
bring
their
derivative
action
that
purports
to
be
on
behalf
of
north
shore
in
the
federal
court
or
must
they
bring
it
in
the
state
court,
where
the
--
only
the
corporation
--
i
mean
where
the
corporation
could
bring
this
suit.
it's
an
illinois
corporation
and
the
real
defendants
are
citizens
or
doing
business
in
illinois.
now,
the
constitution,
to
go
back
to
elementary
principles,
and
i'll
run
through
these
very
quickly.
the
constitution
provides
that
jurisdiction
shall
extend
controversies
between
citizens
of
different
states.
the
judicial
code
implements
that
by
adding
the
requirements
of
the
matter
in
controversy
shall
exceed
$3000.
in
a
case
of
multiple
parties,
it
was
early
decided
that
all
plaintiffs
must
be
citizens
of
states
other
than
that
of
all
the
defendants.
now,
that's
what
the
situation
is
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
now,
other
rules
of
law
that
apply
here,
there
have
almost
a
handbook
character,
are
that
in
the
shareholder's
derivative
suit,
the
plaintiff's
suit
is
not
their
own.
it's
that
of
the
corporation
the
claim
that
the
corporation
has
a
cause
of
action
against
these
real
defendants.
the
corporation
is
an
indispensable
party
to
the
suit
and
another
requirement
that
you've
laid
down
for
jurisdiction
is
there
must
be
actual,
substantial
controversy
between
citizens
of
different
states
in
order
to
sustain
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
that
in
determining
whether
there
exists
a
controversy,
the
parties
in
the
law
suit
will
be
realigned
according
to
their
real
interest
in
the
controversy,
not
just
to
set
out
in
the
pleading.
now,
the
real
interest
of
north
shore
is
obviously
along
with
that
of
the
plaintiffs.
its
cause
of
action
is
being
asserted.
any
recovery
that
is
achieved
in
this
action
will
go
only
to
north
shore.
and
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
but
--
they
did,
that's
right.
they
refused
to
institute
a
suit.
but
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff's
contention,
here,
the
petitioner's
contention
is
that
mere
refusal
to
sue
is
enough
to
give
him
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
that's
not
what
the
cases
have
said.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
basic
objection
to
that
is
that
we've
no
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
for
a
corporation
and
a
board
of
directors
that
acts
as
we
all
think
boards
of
directors
should
be.
that
is
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes,
sir,
23(b)
is
the
rule
that
relates
solely
to
the
question
of
--
of
equity.
that
is
whether
they
--
whether
they
state
a
--
a
claim,
you
might
say,
under
equity.
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
to
prove
what
sir?
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
but
they
--
the
--
that
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
state
in
his
complaint
the
facts
which
entitle
him
--
or
i
mean
entitle
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
and
he
hasn't
done
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
held.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
if
it
complies
with
the
other
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
requirements
they
have
to
give
the
reason.
one
of
the
things
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
they
must
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
it
does
not.
they
must
have
--
they
have
the
reasons
for
the
refusal.
if
i
misunderstood
your
question,
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
they
must
be
stated
and
incidentally
this
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
and
i
take
it
that
we're
not
arguing.
that's
what
judge
knoch
decided.
and
i
take
it
that
that's
not
the
question
here
before
the
court.
although,
the
plaintiffs
in
their
brief
and
i
think
we've
tried
in
our
brief
to
straighten
on
the
matter
on
that.
try
to
confuse
the
two
questions
that
is
compliance
with
rule
23
(b)
and
the
jurisdictional
alignment.
now,
the
--
the
controversy
that
governs
jurisdiction
here
is
the
--
the
principal
controversy,
the
one
between
the
corporation
and
the
real
defendants.
and
that's
the
one
that
--
that's
the
only
judicial
--
justiciable
controversy
present
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
sir?
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
where
the
line
comes.
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
sir.
they
--
that
is
that
--
you
have
this
general
principle
in
the
federal
courts
that
parties
are
aligned
according
to
their
real
interest.
now,
the
court
said
in
doctor
versus
harrington
and
in
koster
versus
lumbermens,
reasserted
it
recently,
that
the
corporation
would
normally
be
aligned
as
a
plaintiff
in
all
stockholder
suits.
and
it
is
only
--
there's
an
exception
to
that
rule
of
jurisdiction
that
applies
when
the
corporation
is
in
--
in
antagonistic
hands
or
as
doctor
versus
harrington
said,
"a
corporation
maybe
under
a
control,
antagonistic
to
the
stockholder
and
made
to
act
in
a
way
detrimental
to
his
rights.‚Äù
and
in
koster,
you
said
that
the
stockholder
is
allowed
to
act
in
protection
of
the
corporation's
interests,
somewhat
as
an
ex-friend
might
do
for
an
individual
because
it's
disabled
from
protecting
itself.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
well,
they
don't
allege
in
this
complaint
any
control
by
the
defendants.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
they
do
allege
that
several
of
the
defendants
were
directors.
now,
that
allegation
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
said
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
majority
of
a
board
of
nine
and
it
--
and
wouldn't
ordinarily
mean
that
the
majority
and
the
--
the
facts
which
are
in
this
record
as
--
as
to
who
the
directors
were
and
so
on,
shows
that
the
defendants
constitute
less
than
a
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
who
refused
to
sue.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
our
position
on
realignment
would
be
that
that
is
a
question
--
a
preliminary
fact
question
to
be
tried
out
in
the
case,
sir.
such
as
was
done
in
the
companion
case,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
as
i
take
it,
the
--
i
have
two
views
on
that
sir.
one
is
that
as
the
decisions
now
stand,
doctor
versus
harrington
and
koster
versus
lumbermens,
that
the
corporation
would
remain
aligned
as
a
defendant,
if
it
were
under
the
control
of
the
real
defendant.
the
other
point
which
we
raise
in
our
brief
and
maybe
one
of
which
the
court
is
interested
is
that
this
so-called
exception
to
the
rule
of
alignment
is
an
anomaly
in
the
law
that
serves
no
useful
purpose
except
to
extend
jurisdiction
--
diversity
jurisdiction
in
the
cases
where
--
that
ought
not
really
to
be
decided,
be
in
the
federal
courts
and
really
on
the
state
courts.
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
sir,
that's
right
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
that's
what
i
say,
the
cases
at
this
court.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
we
don't
have
to
go
beyond
the
decisions
of
this
court.
they're
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
doctor
versus
harrington,
koster
versus
lumbermens
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
oh,
it
states
it
exactly
that,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
no,
that's
not
true,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
the
exception
is
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes,
sir.
but
if
this
cause
of
action
is
being
enforced,
i
don't
have
to
--
i
don't
have
to
get
the
rules
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
all
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
here's
the
exception,
your
honor.
it's
the
one
that
the
court
used
in
doctor
versus
harrington.
it
said
that
--
that
parties
are
aligned
according
to
their
real
interest.
the
interest
of
a
corporation,
captive
or
not,
the
interest
of
the
corporation
itself
is
along
with
that
of
the
plaintiff
to
assert
its
cause
of
action.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
thank
you,
sir.
i
think
that
it
might
be
a
good
point
of
departure
for
this
after
recess
just
to
briefly
state
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
if
the
rule
was
that
they
were
applying.
and
they
said
that
the
test
is
whether
there's
a
collision
between
the
personal
interest
of
those
in
control
of
the
corporation
and
the
interest
of
the
corporation
itself
in
the
subject
matter
in
the
suit.
such
antagonism
may
appear
from
the
relationship
of
those
in
control
of
the
corporation
to
the
defendants
or
by
the
words
or
acts
of
those
in
control,
which
as
a
matter
of
fact,
proven
attitude
antagonistic
to
the
suit.
that's
on
the
last
page
practically
of
the
record.
that's
the
test
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
were
applying.
now,
this
--
this
corporation
doesn't
fall
within
either
of
those
circumstances,
controlled
by
the
real
defendants
is
not
alleged
and
sometimes
referred
to
in
a
case
as
domination
or
in
antagonistic
hands.
and
it
is
in
a
case
where
the
corporation
has
taken
sides
with
the
real
defendant,
become
partners
in
litigation
with
the
real
defendants,
actively
participating
in
the
defense
in
such
manner
that
the
court
can
conclude
that
the
corporation
is
in
antagonistic
hands
with
respect
to
the
basic
controversy.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
opinion
and
i
believe
our
brief
also
amply
demonstrate
that
no
hostility
or
antagonism
was
alleged
or
shown.
the
complaint
doesn't
allege
facts
which
charge
that
the
people
were
in
control.
now,
referring
to
the
complaint
here,
he
referred
--
mr.
doyle
did
on
his
argument
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
statement
about
hostile
hands.
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
very
short
excerpt
from
the
complaint.
it's
from
paragraph
4
(a).
it
starts
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
the
record,
the
last
sentence,
‚Äúa
stockholder's
resolution
directing
the
bringing
of
suit
would
be
futile,
since
the
control
of
such
action
would
be
in
hostile
hands
for
the
reason
that
the
officers
and
directors
and
counsel
for
the
railway
company
have
indicated
as
plaintiffs
are
informed
and
believed
that
they
do
not
believe
this
suit
should
be
brought
and
they
would
refuse
to
bring
it.‚Äù
in
other
words,
the
complaint
says
that
the
action
be
in
hostile
hands
because
the
directors
have
indicated
they'd
refused
to
bring
a
suit.
all
that
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
treated
this
as
a
--
a
mere
conclusory
allegation
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
and
it
said
that
the
plaintiffs
must
state
facts
in
their
complaint,
which
lend
credence
to
the
statement
that
the
action
would
be
in
hostile
hands.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well
we
didn't
--
we
had
precisely
that,
sir.
we
had
an
affidavit
of
mr.
busch
that
--
the
general
counsel
of
the
corporation.
he
made
a
statement
in
the
district
court
and
he
filed
an
affidavit.
he
--
and
he
made
a
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
were
cited
at
great
length,
the
reasons
why
the
corporation
had
refused
to
commence
the
suit.
those
are
the
reasons
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
put
in
its
complaint
but
didn't
and
mr.
busch
supplied
those
by
affidavit.
now
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
showed
just
the
opposite.
it
showed
that
the
directors
were
exercising
an
honest
judgment
based
on
legal
advice
and
investigation
of
the
action.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
think
he
said
that.
yes,
sir.
the
affidavit
is
in
the
record,
i
think
that's
a
fair
summary
of
what
he
said.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
he
expressed
his
legal
opinion
to
the
board
of
directors
to
the
effect
that
the
fact
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
he
didn't
say
to
the
court
upon
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
all
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
i
suggest
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
and
your
--
your
question
is,
if
he
said
that
he
thought
that
--
the
corporation
thought
that
the
suit
was
ill-founded,
would
that
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
as
i
said
before,
he
didn't
quite
say
that
but
i
think
that
the
neutral
corporation
--
the
corporation,
it's
not
throwing
stumbling
blocks
in
the
way.
in
whose
refusal
to
bring
the
suit
is
not
based
upon
a
control
by
the
real
defendants
or
by
an
attitude
toward
the
basic
controversy
that
is
opposed
to
that
of
the
plaintiffs
that
that
corporation
should
be
aligned
where
its
real
interest
lies.
it's
not
disabled
from
protecting
itself.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
it's
up
to
--
that
may
be
true,
sir.
but
in
order
to
try,
in
order
to
have
something
to
try,
there
must
be
allegations
of
fact
in
the
complaint.
there
must
be
an
issue
of
fact
raised
to
be
tried.
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
it
did
two
things.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no,
sir.
they
have
to
prove
that
the
refusal
of
the
corporation
to
act,
to
bring
the
litigation
was
wrongful.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
wrongful
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
improper
motives,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
the
--
in
other
words,
whether
a
corporation
is
--
this
is
really
getting
over
to
the
point
that
was
decided
in
the
distinct
court
but
i'd
be
glad
to
answer
your
question.
it
--
a
corporation
doesn't
have
to
bring
every
lawsuit
that
it
--
it
can
--
has
or
can
have.
there's
a
discretion
vested
in
the
board
of
directors
as
to
initiating
litigation
as
well
as
to
doing
any
other
corporate
act.
and
if
you're
going
to
permit
a
stockholder,
however
misguided
to
bring
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
just
because
the
corporation
refuses
to
do
it
without
that
refusal
being
wrongful.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
all
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir,
if
there's
a
--
this
is
--
disinterested
majority
of
the
board
that
makes
that
decision.
yes,
sir.
if
that
--
if
that
decision
is
based
without
control,
now
of
the
corporation
or
the
board
by
the
real
defendants,
if
that
based
on
what
is
for
the
best
interest
of
the
corporation,
that
decision
of
the
board
of
directors
should
control
the
binding.
but
i
take
it,
that's
not
exactly
the
question
we
have
here
that
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
sir,
there's
a
disinterested
majority
there.
actually
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
in
this
case
and
it's
apparent
in
the
various
minutes
insofar
that
we
have,
there
were
two
interlocking
directors
so
to
speak.
that
is
two
directors
of
the
corporation
from
which
these
properties
were
purchased
were
also
directors
of
north
shore.
at
the
time
the
decision
was
made
not
to
sue
those
two
directors
upon
advice
of
the
corporate
counsel,
refrained
from
voting
and
the
vote
was
unanimous,
seven
to
nothing.
and
those
facts
were
brought
out
in
the
pre-trial
controversy.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir,
i'd
be
glad
to
take
them
up
one
by
one
if
you
like,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
those
allegations
can
simply
prove
the
relationships
among
the
defendants.
that's
one
of
the
points
they
make
is
that
they
charge
that
--
that
all
of
the
defendants
are
related
to
the
three
dominant
defendant.
they
don't
charge
that
the
dominant
defendant
directors
are
related
to
the
three
dominant
if
i
may
say.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
there
are
--
there's
three
directors
that
are
involved
here,
runkel,
bogan
and
burleigh.
those
are
the
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
and
runkel
was
not
a
director
when
the
decision
that
a
sue
was
made.
so
there's
only
two
of
the
people
that
are
referred
to
there
that
were
directors
at
the
time
the
decision
not
to
sue
was
made.
then
you
have
fallon
and
clinch.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
bogan
and
burleigh.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that
might
be.
but
you
have
to
have
--
you
have
to
show
as
i
get
the
law,
you
have
to
show
that
there's
either
control
of
the
corporation
by
the
real
defendants
or
domination
by
the
litigants
and
that's
not
alleged
nor
shown.
now
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no
sir,
not
when
the
rottenness
of
the
apple
was
made
apparent
and
other
directors
know
about
it.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
suppose
a
disclosure.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
think
it
was
getting
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
think
we're
getting
far
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
now,
if
you'd
like
me
to
i'll
--
i'll
run
through
this
allegation.
we've
done
it
in
the
brief,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
that
they
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
point
--
point
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir,
but
that
isn't
charged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes
sir,
and
we
--
we
support
at
that
very
vigorously
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
also
argued
that
the
--
that
the
corporation
because
it
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
it
never
reached
it
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
because
that
it
said,
we
have
at
the
outset
a
question
of
jurisdiction
raised
by
the
traer
defendants.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
i
think
that's
correct,
yes
sir,
and
many
of
the
same
allegations
bear
on
these
two
questions.
one
is
the
bill
state
an
equitable
cause
of
--
for
relief.
and
two
that
it's
state
one
of
jurisdiction,
diversity
jurisdiction.
many
of
the
allegations
are
similar
but
they
are
not
the
same
and
i
--
we
cover
that
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
now,
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
as
i
understand
the
effect
of
the
court's
rule,
yes
sir.
it's
not
a
question
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
tried
to
be
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
-
as
i
take
a
possession
in
my
brief
that
that
question
is
not
before
this
court,
as
i
understand
the
rule,
rule
40.
and
i
cite
the
specific
paragraph
of
it.
i
tried
to
find
cases
where
--
from
which
i
could
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
that
the
court
should
consider
it.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
it
isn't
before
it.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
because
it
wasn't
one
of
the
questions
raised
in
the
petition.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
all
right,
thank
you
sir.
well,
i'm
going
to
skip
around
a
little
bit
so
i'll
be
sure
not
to
overlook
this.
they
have
argued
that
mr.
doyle
has
argued
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
findings
of
fact.
that's
his
second
question
that
he
raises.
now,
i
think
all
you
need
to
do
to
weigh
that
clause
is
to
read
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
it's
doing.
it
said
that
accepting
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
--
only
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
to
be
considered,
then
it
examined
the
--
several
allegations
of
the
complaint.
and
it
said
that
that
complaint
failed
to
charge
that
the
corporation
or
those
in
control
of
it
were
hostile
to
the
prosecution
of
this
suit.
then,
it
said,
‚Äúsecondly,
the
named
plaintiffs
say
that
if
matters
beyond
the
complaint
are
to
be
looked
to,
the
decisive
fact
is
that
the
answer
filed
by
the
railway
company
controverts
the
complaint
and
important
particulars
referring
specifically
to
paragraph
16
of
the
answer.‚Äù
then,
the
court
examined
that
paragraph
of
the
answer
and
held
that
that
didn't
--
that
that
answer
did
not
show
antagonism
to
the
suit.
then
they
examined
some
other
conduct,
the
conduct
that
mr.
busch,
the
counsel
for
the
corporation
in
--
which
is
recited
at
great
length.
here,
is
his
statements
to
the
court
and
they
found
that
each
of
those
statements
showed
that
there
was
no
antagonism
towards
this
suit.
they
didn't
make
any
findings
of
fact
there.
then
they
--
they
make
--
they
make
the
final
statement
in
the
opinion
that's
on
the
very
last
page
of
the
opinion.
it
says,
‚Äúsituations
readily
suggest
themselves
in
which
plaintiffs
might
be
impeded
in
preparing
in
prosecuting
a
case
such
as
a
refusal
of
the
corporation's
permit
to
access
to
its
files
and
records,
or
the
corporation
is
giving
aid
to
the
defendants
in
opposing
the
suit.‚Äù
it
says,
‚Äúno
such
relationship,
words,
or
acts
are
charged
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.‚Äù
well,
that's
my
full
point
on
that
finding
of
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
findings
of
fact.
it
said
we
--
if
we
accept
the
plaintiff's
contention
that
this
is
to
be
determined
on
the
complaint
alone,
the
complaint
is
inadequate.
the
plaintiffs
in
their
reply
brief
that
pointed
the
certain
facts
which
they
say
are
decisive
that
antagonism
exists
with
--
the
court
of
appeals
examined
each
one
of
those
alleged
facts.
really,
they
were
the
answer
in
the
conduct
of
counsel,
that's
all.
they
weren't
all
this
matter
in
the
depositions
of
any
and
said,
‚Äúwe
don't
find
that
in
any
of
those.‚Äù
there
is
evidence
of
antagonism
toward
this
suit.
then
they
went
on
they
said,
‚Äúwe
--
we
can
conceive
of
situations
for
there
might
be
antagonism
shown
by
corporate
conduct.
no
such
conduct
is
charged.‚Äù
now,
that's
prior
from
the
finding
of
fact.
and
clearly
of
a
failure
to
charge
essential
facts
is
to
be
differentiated
from
a
making
a
findings
of
fact.
now,
we
contended
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
--
mr.
doyle
talked
about
this
summary
judgment.
one
of
the
things
we
contended
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
on
the
state
of
the
record.
summary
judgment
was
justified.
we've
submitted
affidavits
and
we've
submitted
depositions
and
these
people
had
had
a
year
or
two
years
to
submit
countervailing
material
and
they
didn't
do
it.
now,
if
they
thought
there
was
anything
in
the
facts
that
would
show
that
there
was
antagonism,
it
was
up
to
them
either
to
amend
their
complaint
as
mr.
justice
black
suggested
to
charge
such
conduct
or
at
least
to
show
by
an
affidavit
or
deposition
or
some
other
way
to
point
out
a
fact
which
showed
that
there
was
antagonism.
and
the
--
the
facts
that
they
pointed
out
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
didn't
show
any
such
conduct.
it
didn't
charged
it
and
the
burden
is
on
them
to
charge
it.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well
i
--
i
thought
--
i
mean
i
was
attempting
to
answer
that,
sir.
that's
not
so.
i
mean,
they
--
the
only
things
that
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
in
its
opinion
that
were
matters
beyond
the
complaint,
were
the
answer
of
the
railway
company.
in
other
words,
what
is
the
attitude
that
this
corporation
has
expressed
in
its
answer?
has
it
joined
with
the
real
defendants?
is
it
neutral?
has
it
joined
with
the
plaintiff?
and
they
said
that
--
that
nothing
in
the
answer
in
certain
specific
allegations
were
referred
to
shows
that
there's
antagonism
towards
the
suit.
then,
mr.
busch
made
an
argument
in
the
district
court
at
the
time
mr.
marshall
proposed
that
his
--
in
the
pre-trial
conference,
proposed
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
busch
said
in
effect,
‚Äúon
the
corporation,
this
litigation
is
going
to
cost
us
a
lot
of
money.
here's
a
--
here
is
a
motion
that
if
it
is
right
--
and
i
don't
say
it's
right
or
wrong.
but
if
it's
right,
it
will
determine
this
litigation.
i
urge
the
court
to
listen
to
it.‚Äù
that's
about
what
he
said.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
examined
that
statement
and
quoted
from
it
at
length
and
said
that
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would
be.
but
this
--
you
have
to
realize
the
context
in
which
the
court
did
then.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
‚Äúwe
accept
their
contention
that
--
that
only
the
complaint
is
to
be
looked
to
know.
we
can't
find
anything
in
the
complaint
to
charge
the
antagonism.‚Äù
but
the
plaintiff
say,
‚Äúeven
if
you're
going
to
look
beyond
the
complaint,
here
are
some
decisive
facts
that
appear
in
the
record
and
it
looked
at
those
facts
and
said,
‚Äúwe
don't
think
they
show
any
evidence
of
antagonism.‚Äù
you've
got
to
realize
--
i
should
perhaps
say
it
that
way
but
i
mean
--
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
when
this
matter
was
decided
by
judge
knoch,
it
was
an
extensive
pre-trial
conference.
there
had
been
complaints,
motions,
answers.
there
had
been
three
requests
for
admissions
of
fact
and
answers
thereto.
there'd
been
half
a
dozen
or
a
dozen
depositions
and
there
were
a
couple
of
affidavits.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
sir,
as
the
terra
cotta
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
--
torn
off
and
brown
never
put
on
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no,
sir,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
railway
company
which
is
substantially
identical
with
the
brief
that
is
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
so,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
don't
think
they
do
refer
to
that
brief
in
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
the
--
they
do
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
oh
yes.
that's
page
318
of
the
record,
it
says
in
the
railway
brief
in
this
court
and
the
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
a
quotation
from
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i
am.
well,
i
have
from
--
mr.
gale
and
i
have
arranged
to
divide
this
time
and
i
practically
--
i've
come
to
the
end
of
my
time.
i
just
want
to
mention
a
couple
of
other
things
that
mr.
doyle
hasn't
referred
to
the
case
of
chicago
versus
mill
upon
which
he
based
his
principal
argument
in
the
brief
as
i
understand
it.
we
rely
on
doctor
versus
harrington
and
koster
versus
lumbermens
and
i
think
we
adequately
covered
in
the
brief
the
case
of
chicago
versus
mill.
now,
on
this
distinction
between
rule
23
(b)
and
this
rule
of
jurisdiction
alignment
that's
here
before
the
court,
that
also
has
been
covered
in
the
brief
and
in
the
case
of
venner
against
great
northern
which
referred
to
many
times
there,
that
distinction
has
made
abundantly
clear
that
23
(b)
is
a
rule
of
equity
and
the
decision
is
to
whether
complaint
comprise
with
that
as
an
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
whereas
this
jurisdiction
of
alignment
rule
is
not.
it's
a
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
yes
sir,
insofar
as
rule
2
--
certainly
insofar
as
rule
23
(b)
required.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
--
is
it
indianapolis
versus
chase?
i
think
that's
a
case.
the
--
in
any
event,
the
court
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
facts
must
be
pleaded
so
that
the
first
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
well,
substantiality
there
at
all
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
substance
has
to
be
there.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
i'm
on
rule
23
(b)
that
goes
into
some
specificity
as
to
the
exact
allegation
that
have
to
be
made.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
no,
but
you
have
to
state
--
that
you
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
and
the
reasons
for
failures
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
for
not
making
such
effort.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
that's
precisely
correct
and
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
it
was
not
done
here
and
--
and
--
mr.
james
e.
s.
baker
mr.
gale
says
he
will
undertake
to
answer
that
question.
i
have
agreed
to
give
him
the
balance
of
the
arguments
and
i
thank
you,
sir.
