(voice

true
also,
mr.
doyle,
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleged
only
that,
"several
of
the
directors
were
being
dominated."
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
not
the
board.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
baker,
doesn't
that
depend
upon
the
concept
of
the
exception?
if
in
truth
the
exception
obtains
only
when
the
corporation
is
the
captive
in
hostile
hands,
then
you
wouldn't
so
argue,
would
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
baker,
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
hesitate,
you
had
so
many
interruptions
--
but
i
have
a
question
or
two.
i
wonder
if
i
might
have
a
privilage
of
asking
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
it
may
land
to
something
to
clarity
here.
in
the
first
instance,
there
must
be
allegations
tending
to
show
that
the
corporation's
right
of
exercise
of
free
will
have
been
destroyed,
is
that
approved?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
allegations
are
adequate
is
one
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right.
now,
the
allegations
being
present
and
if
challenged
become
an
issue
of
fact,
am
i
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
the
third
question
is,
you
say
that
simply
because
a
mere
majority
of
the
directors
are
acting
in
good
faith,
domination
cannot
be
solved.
do
you
really
mean
that?
wouldn't
it
be
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
even
a
strong
minority
might
dominate?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
right
then,
then
that's
the
view
the
judge
not
took.
and
he,
treating
the
matter,
the
herman
says,
“inadequate
is
a
matter
of
law
dismissed.”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
it?
now,
if
he
was
right
about
that
that
ends
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
language
is
you
state
with
particularity
of
the
efforts
of
the
plaintiff
to
secure
from
managing
directors
or
trustees
and
if
necessary
from
the
shareholders
such
action
as
he
desires.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
reasons
for
his
failure
to
obtain
such
action
or
the
reason
for
making
such
effort.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they're
not
making
such
effort.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
