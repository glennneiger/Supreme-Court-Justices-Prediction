mr.
doyle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that,
mr.
doyle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
baker
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
baker,
according
to
your
theory,
does
it
make
any
difference,
so
far
as
alignment
of
parties
is
concerned
whether
the
corporation
is
neutral
or
antagonistic
to
the
plaintiff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
baker
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
wrong
with
that,
if
you
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
they
--
did
he
say
that
he
believed
that
the
suit
was
ill-founded?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
make
him
neutral?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
insofar
as
the
suit
is
concerned,
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
alignment
of
parties,
the
question
is
whether
they're
--
whether
the
corporation
is
friendly
or
--
or
unfriendly
or
as
you
say
neutral
to
the
--
to
the
litigation.
but
if
he
says,
â€œwe
have
--
we
have
judged
it
and
--
and
we
find
that
there
is
no
merit
to
it,
we
believe
that"
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
suit
should
--
well,
i
know
but
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
putting
a
little
gloss
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
he
says,
"we
don't
think
that
the
lawsuit
should
be
maintained."
how
is
that
consistent
with
your
theory
that
because
the
corporation
is
neutral
that
it
should
be
in
lined
as
a
plaintiff
rather
than
as
a
defendant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
as
i
understand,
you
concede
that
if
--
if
it
was
antagonistic
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
litigation
and
it
should
be
a
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
you
know
whether
--
what
influence
there
was
behind
it
unless
you
tried
the
case
out
from
the
merits
and
found
out
what
they
--
what
the
interest
and
what
the
motives
were
of
the
corporation
in
not
acting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
the
issue,
is
it
--
do
they
have
to
prove
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
the
corporation
or
do
they
have
to
prove
merely
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
the
individuals
who
have
--
who
are
indebted
to
the
corporation
and
then
show
that
the
corporation
just
didn't
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
wrongful
in
what
sense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
didn't
bring
it
--
but
they
didn't
bring
it
in
the
facts,
justified
it
or
because
they
had
improper
motives
in
not
doing
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
it's
your
position
that
if
--
if
the
--
these
other
people
had
actually
committed
the
wrongful
acts,
that
were
complained
of
in
the
complaint,
and
that
was
an
established
fact.
and
the
board
of
directors,
just
without
any
particular
malicious
reasoning,
just
didn't
want
to
bring
the
action.
would
you
say
that
that
--
that
would
defeat
the
action?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
well,
i'm
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
give
us
a
converse
of
what
i'm
asking,
not
a
misguided
stockholder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
a
--
but
a
stockholder
who
--
who
shows,
who
establishes
that
certain
people
did
a
wrong
to
the
corporation
that
resulted
in
--
in
a
severe
loss
to
the
corporation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
--
we
accept
that
as
--
as
a
proven
fact.
but
the
board
of
director
says,
"well,
true,
amounted
to
a
million
dollars
maybe
but
we
don't
choose
to
do
anything
about
it."
do
you
--
and
you
don't
have
--
you're
not
in
the
position
to
prove
that
it
was
an
immoral
act
if
they
did
or
unconscionable
act
because
of
personal
interest.
do
you
still
think
that
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
board
of
directors
and
that
they
should
in
that
posture
be
a
party
plaintiff
instead
of
a
party
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
--
let
me
ask
just
one
other
question.
it
might
not
be
determinative
but
i'm
interested
in
it
anyway.
you
said
that
there
must
be
control,
take
your
nine
men
board
of
directors
that
you
spoke
of
a
little
while
ago.
suppose
they
could
establish
that
nine
or
that
four
out
of
the
nine
had
improper
influence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
brought
to
bear
in
this
matter
and
this
results
obtained,
will
their
action
fail
because
they
haven't
proved
the
fifth
member
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
was
controlled?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
baker,
i'm
going
to
take
one
more
interruption
and
this
one
might
not
be
unwelcome.
we've
--
we've
all
taken
a
lot
of
your
time
as
we
did
of
mr.
doyle's.
i
will
--
i'm
going
give
you
10
minutes
more
to
cite
if
you
--
in
order
that
you
might
be
able
to
complete
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
the
statement
of
mr.
doyle,
to
the
effect
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
great
many
of
these
things
that
were
not
legitimately
a
part
of
the
record?
i
--
i
so
understood
him
to
--
to
say
that.
what
about
the
use
of
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
appropriate
on
hearing
on
the
demurrer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
gale,
is
this
--
is
this
all
proper
on
the
demurrer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
--
if
it
was
on
a
summary
judgment,
it
would
be
one
thing.
you
could
use
on
this
pretrial
material
but
on
--
on
a
demurrer,
should
we
take
all
of
those
things
into
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
--
what
are
we
arguing
now,
on
a
demurrer
or
on
a
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
--
but
we're
at
least
entitled
to
know
what
we're
arguing
about,
whether
we're
arguing
a
demurrer
here
or
whether
we
are
arguing
a
--
arguing
on
a
summary
judgment.
now,
i
understood
mr.
doyle
was
saying
that
it
was
conceded
by
--
by
counsel
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
demurrer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
now.
i
may
have
misunderstood
mr.
doyle
but
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
--
understood
him
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
285.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
just
one
at
a
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doyle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
yes
sir,
you
have
20
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
might
give
them
to
the
court,
if
you
please.
