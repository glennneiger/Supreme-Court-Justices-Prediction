justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
then
that
the
taking
of
the
testimony
directed
by
judge
barnes
has
not
yet
occurred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nor
all
of
these
intervening
material
in
the
record
is
what?
depositions
and
requests
for
admission
to
cite?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
does
--
and
does
some
of
this
material
touch
from
the
issue
as
to
which
judge
knoch
said
was
not
an
appropriate
allegation
in
the
complaint?
namely,
the
demand
upon
the
directors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
essentially
is
it
--
as
regard
to
your
second
proposition,
your
position
that
this
was
relied
upon
to
make
a
fact
finding
adverse
to
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
doyle
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
judge
knoch's
the
--
he
keeps
saying
a
rule
of
equity.
is
it
--
other
than
merely
that
he
found
that
the
pleadings
did
not
state
the
cause
of
action?
that's
all
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
that's
what
i'm
not
yet
quite
clear
about
is
that
whether
all
of
this
material
before
judge
knoch,
which
you
termed
pleadings,
created
a
fact
question
in
that
regard.
i
gathered
from
what
you
said,
you
treating
it
as
a
demurrer
which
i
suppose
means
giving
every
intendment
in
favor
of
the
complaint.
treated
that
way,
it
did
state
a
cause
of
action.
but
that
perhaps
referring
then
to
the
other
material,
which
you
suggest
that
your
adversary
that
addedd
--
judge
knoch
concluded,
it
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
complaint,
although
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
reference
to
all
these
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
was
--
what
there
a
fact
question,
taking
all
these
materials
outside
the
complaint?
did
they
present
a
fact
question
on
the
issue,
whether
the
directors
acted
in
good
faith
in
refusing
to
bring
the
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
ordinarily
if
they
do
raise
a
fact
question,
that's
a
reason
for
denying
summary
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
baker
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
tell
me.
assuming
hostility
means
as
you
suggest
improper
motives,
is
there
no
sustenance
for
the
charge
of
hostility
in
the
remaining
allegation
to
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
getting
to
laying
aside
for
the
moment
while
i
gather
as
your
position
with
a
decent
as
to
the
majority,
however,
it
may
be
the
corrupt
--
now
on
the
large,
the
corrupt
minority.
a
decent
that
a
majority
does
sufficiently
say
that
the
action
may
not
be
maintained,
laying
that
aside
for
a
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
there
enough
in
the
allegations
beginning
at
paragraph
8
for
those
several
pages
to
add
more
than
it
was
to
the
charge
of
hostility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
none
of
these
allegations
concerned
with
the
either
directors
of
other
in
control
of
the
management
of
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
all
of
them
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
these
two
--
to
those
two,
who
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
isn't
that
enough
from
the
allegation
that
concerns
their
activities
in
connection
with
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
support
a
finding
at
least
just
to
them
of
hostility?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
as
the
rotten
apple
theory
doesn't
apply
in
case
to
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
only
at
the
allegations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
suggesting
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
baker
may
i
ask?
do
you
conceive
it
necessary
in
this
kind
of
suit
to
proceed
--
to
plead
the
sensual
allegations
anymore
precisely
than
the
sensual
allegations
that
are
required
to
be
pleaded
under
the
federal
rules
in
any
form
of
action,
maintainable
under
those
rules?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
of
the
elements
now,
the
way
in
which
the
necessary
elements
are
pleaded.
is
there
any
special
formula
that
has
to
be
applied
in
the
pleading
here
than
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
they
must
be
pleaded.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
there
any
special
way
they
have
to
be
pleaded?
in
other
words,
generally,
i
think,
pleading
is
under
the
federal
rules
as
long
as
the
substance
of
the
necessary
elements
may
reasonably
be
found
in
the
words
used
in
the
pleading
that
satisfies
the
requirements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
old
test
mentality
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
the
substance
has
to
be
there
but
that's
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
you
have
to
use
the
precise
language
of
23
(b)
or
as
favorable
to
the
pleading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
state
the
substance
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
we
can
find
it
within
the
four
corners
of
this
complaint.
the
fact
that
the
exact
language
of
that
rule
or
any
other
is
not
employed
in
the
pleading.
it's
not
material,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
make
the
comment
mr.
baker
strikes
me
with
to
be
here
seven
years
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint
on
the
procedural
point,
all
of
which
might
well
have
been
avoided
had
judge
barnes'
original
notion
been
followed
through,
he
is
extremely
unfortunate.
we
talk
about
delay
in
litigation.
but
here,
we're
arguing
here
today
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
the
procedural
point
after
two
years
or
seven
years,
rather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
doyle,
looking
at
your
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
you
said
your
notice
of
appeals
in
judge
knoch's
order
and
your
statement
of
points
at
294
apparently
go
only
to
whether
the
complaint
did
or
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
and
then,
your
designation
of
the
record
at
296
seems
to
include
only
those
things
appropriate
to
that
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right,
292.
but
then,
i
noticed
that
your
adversaries
getting
at
296
designated
all
the
material
we've
been
discussing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then,
there's
a
stipulation
at
302
which
currently
you
signed,
which
in
addition
makes
part
of
the
record,
the
depositions
of
mr.
traer
and
clinch.
now,
in
what
--
what
bearing
did
those
depositions
have
on
the
only
issue
apparently
argued
in
ways
by
your
statement
of
points?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
did
you
brief
the
diversity
point
at
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
your
main
brief
or
in
your
reply
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
supplementing
the
record
--
with
all
of
the
material.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
doyle,
do
you
mean
this
for
example?
suppose
in
all
good
faith,
the
board
of
directors
says
it's
useless
to
bring
this
lawsuit
because
if
we
get
a
judgment,
we
can't
recover
it.
why
waste
the
money
of
the
corporation
prosecuting
the
suit
in
the
time
of
its
officers
and
directors,
which
will
be
taken
up
from
the
prosecution,
and
that's
the
reason.
now,
it's
an
entirely
bona
fide
honest
refusal
on
that
ground.
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
that's
enough
to
establish
the
right
of
a
plaintiff
to
have
a
corporate
align
--
the
corporation
aligned
as
a
defendant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
i've
given
you
the
hypothesis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i've
given
you
the
hypothesis.
that's
a
pure
business
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
directors,
very
honest
one
that
there's
no
use
in
wasting
time
prosecuting
a
lawsuit
merely
for
the
fun
of
prosecuting
a
lawsuit.
