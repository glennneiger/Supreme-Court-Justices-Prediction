the
objection
--
the
objection
which
invokes
the
supervisory
authority
of
this
court
relates
to
what
was
done
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
in
the
district
court.
i
mean
the
second
--
the
second
ground,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
motion
--
the
motion
came
on
for
hearing
on
affidavit,
as
i
take
it,
before
this
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
no
oral
testimony.
it's
not
on
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
you
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well,
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
obvious
reasons.
this
second
motion
--
who
is
the
judge?
not
before
judge
barnes
--
judge
knoch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
second
motion
on
which
judge
knoch
has
--
if
you
did,
i
didn't
get
it.
that
i
didn't
get
it
or
is
that
inception
is
the
same
--
the
basis
of
it,
the
same
as
that
recorded
bond?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
the
alleged
collusion
between
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
--
what
--
didn't
touch
there,
therefore,
the
diversity
problem
from
what
you've
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
implication
being
as
a
matter
of
corporate
law
that
unless
you
allege
that,
that
was
an
exercise
of
their
directorial
discretion,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
the
correctness
or
error
of
judge
knoch's
ruling
a
matter
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
on
your
second
ground
--
the
second
ground
that
you're
urging
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
bears
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
doyle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on,
you
finish
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
may
i
before
you
do
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pursue
justice
brennan's
question.
as
i
read
the
oral
statement
of
judge
barnes,
to
which
you
called
our
attention,
he
refused
to
decide
the
question
of
collusion
and
therefore
the
question
of
realignment
of
party
on
the
basis
of
affidavit
and
deposition.
and
he
thought
that
better
go
to
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
from
you,
what
judge
knoch
will
do
was
that
in
the
stockholder's
suit,
for
purposes
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
old
rule
94,
which
i
take
it
is
what's
now
23
(b)
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
an
allegation
that
they
were
wrong
in
not
pursuing
the
claimed
right
of
the
corporation
by
the
stockholder
to
the
claimant,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
that
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
assuming
--
well,
if
you
say
that
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
such
an
allegation
is
necessary,
i'll
take
your
word
for
it
for
want
of
some
better
knowledge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it
is
--
as
i
get
it
from
you
and
you
correct
me.
it
is
a
construction
by
him
that
an
implied
requirement
of
estoppel
in
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
exclusively
on
grounds
of
diversity
must
allege,
must
negative
that
the
refusal
to
bring
a
suit
is
merely
a
--
a
directorial
discretion.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
being
so,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
whether
this
case
comes
here
on
merely
the
affidavits
in
depositions
before
judge
barnes
and
later
before
judge
knoch,
and
raises
the
questions
that
you
are
raising
on
the
pleadings,
including
by
pleadings
of
affidavit
and
requires
deposition,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that
which
judge
barnes
decided
in
not
passing
on
the
motion
until
he
had
a
weighty
basis
of
evidence,
a
testimonial
enlightenment
of
his
mind
is
still,
as
you
replied
to
my
brother
brennan,
is
still
not
satisfied
and
we're
asked
to
pass
on
these
pleadings,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
can't
imagine
a
more
unsatisfactory
situation
than
that,
speaking
for
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
more
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
enlighten
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
--
why
did
not
the
procedure
which
judge
barnes
indicated,
why
was
that
procedure
not
carried
out?
in
other
words,
establishment
of
the
real
interest,
the
conflict
of
interest
among
these
various
people,
two
testimonies
and
not
the
unreliable
or
dubious,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
any
impropriety,
but
the
unsatisfactoriness
of
passing
on
that
by
the
way
of
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
position
is
that
on
the
pleading,
it's
clear
that
there
is
diversity.
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
judge
knoch's
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
a
label,
but
suppose
we
agree
with
judge
knoch.
wouldn't
we
have
to
sustain
this
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
you
maybe
right
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
it
doesn't
follow
that
if
--
if
that
a
suit
is
to
be
sustained
by
a
district
court
merely
because
there's
proper
alignment.
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
judge
knoch
is
right
on
his
equity
ground,
this
judgment
would
have
to
be
sustained,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
your
--
wait.
let's
see,
i
think
you
now
made
it
clear
to
me.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
free
to
--
whether
right
or
wrong
was
free
to
say,
"we
think
judge
knoch
was
right
even
though
there's
diversity".
they
didn't
go
on
that
ground
and
you
would
say
--
they
said
there
was
one
of
jurisdiction
in
the
technical
sense
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
even
if
we
agreed
with
judge
knuck,
the
court
of
appeals,
assuming
we
don't
decide
that
question
here,
being
a
bare
naked
question
of
law
i
take
it,
like
a
visa.
assuming
we
agree
with
judge
knoch,
you
say
on
the
concept
the
court
of
appeals
might
not
agree
with
him
on
his
ground.
namely,
it
was
not
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction,
in
the
federal
jurisdictional
sense,
but
that
there
was
no
equity.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
doyle,
this
isn't
an
ordinary
question
of
pleading.
this
is
a
very
special
type
of
suit
which
is
allowed
in
the
federal
courts,
only
on
a
very
specifically
defined
allegation.
and
if
they're
not
there,
then
the
federal
court
must
throw
out
a
stockholder
suit
which
goes
way
back
as
you
that
doubtless
know.
now,
you
said
that
--
that
23
(b),
i
still
remember
it
under
the
rule
94
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
to
the
rule
94.but
that
does
not
explicitly
require
this
but
that
the
court
did
put
a
gloss
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
that
allegation
be
deemed
necessary
under
the
stockholders
derivative
suit,
to
be
entertained
in
the
diversity
case
in
the
federal
court,
if
it
isn't
an
allegation,
it
isn't
a
question
of
fact.
it's
the
fatal
effect
in
the
complaint.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
if
that
--
yes
i
agree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sure,
we
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
i
promise
to
do
as
well
by
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
railroad
also
going
to
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
speak
for
them?
no,
you
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
nobody
speaks
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
brief
there,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
attitude
of
the
railroad
conceded
by
the
petitioners
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
they're
neutral
or
not,
may
turn
on
whether
they're
controlled
by
somebody
who
isn't
neutral.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
but
you
answered
yes
to
justice
harlan's
question
that
that
satisfies
the
rule
and
by
that,
that
is
the
(inaudible)
in
a
word.
is
that
--
is
the
plaintiff
or
the
stockholder
can
file
a
complaint
and
say,
"on
estoppel
and
company
x?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
company
x
has
a
good
cause
of
action
in
my
opinion
against
m,
the
--
the
corporation
and
its
directors
have
refused
to
bring
suit
against
m.
does
that
say
that
the
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
said
yes
to
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)--
apprehended
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
satisfies
the
rule
that
the
plaintiff
says
the
corporation
has
a
good
cause
of
action
and
it
isn't
for
some
--
it
isn't
pursuing
it.
is
that
a
good
cause
of
--
is
that
state
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
complaint
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
reasons
must
be
other
than
merely
an
exercise
of
discretion,
of
honest
discretion
by
the
directors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
a
corporation
isn't
neutral,
if
the
controlling
directors
have
it
by
the
throat
for
selfish
interests,
antagonistic
to
that
of
the
plaintiff
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
talk
about
neutrality
if
you
subordinate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
doctor
and
harrington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
doctor
and
harrington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suggest
that
doctor
--
as
i
take
it
with
justice
whittaker,
doctor
and
harrington
is
an
exception
to
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
(voice
overlap)
--
very
well,
as
if
you
please,
you
can
call
them
the
exception.
what
you're
dealing
with
is
diversity
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
has
both
--
as
stated
by
mr.
doyle,
everybody
--
nobody
on
the
plaintiff's
side
must
be
of
the
same
state
as
anybody
on
the
defendants
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
isn't
an
exception.
this
is
a
confirmation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
whole
point
of
doctor
and
harrington
is
that
we're
not
going
to
look
at
merely
the
face
of
the
complaint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
--
that
the
plaintiffs
represent
the
corporation's
interest
and
normally
the
corporation
is
the
plaintiff
doesn't
hold,
not
as
an
exception
but
because
it
would
be
a
falsification
of
the
two
doctrines
of
diversity.
because
if
to
you,
justice
whittakers
point,
if
the
corporation
is
the
captive,
then
it
hasn't
got
the
same
interests
as
--
as
the
plaintiff.
then
it
isn't
the
plaintiff
but
either
defendant
whenever
you
got
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can
pin
on
that
the
label
of
exception
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pitch
any
further
doesn't
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
it
isn't
because
it
wasn't
in
doctor
and
harrington.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
baker,
aren't
you
--
aren't
you
blending
two
things
that
are
very
different?
you
talk
at
large
as
to
what
does
or
doesn't
constitute
a
meritorious
suit
by
minority
stockholders
or
by
stockholders
against
the
corporation.
and
so,
we
pass
on
this
thing
at
large
on
the
merit
that
the
state
law
is
questioning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
rest
of
the
cases.
so,
how
can
we
talk
at
large
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
going
to
the
illinois
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
we
get
to
that,
you
have
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
this
kind
of
a
suit
under
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
laid
down
by
the
series
of
the
cases
long
before
23
(b)
was
in
existence
at
which
23
(b)
reflects.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on
what
you
argued
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
that
ruling
of
judge
knoch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
his
treatment
actually
--
the
court
of
appeals'
treatment
was
factually
similar
to
judge
knoch
that
he
applied
it
to
a
different
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
before
you
sit
down,
will
you
deal
however
briefly
with
mr.
doyle's
suggestion
that
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
explicitly
deal
with
the
--
judge
knoch
point,
that
knoch's
ground
to
dismiss
it,
namely,
assuming
there
were
diversity
which
one
on
that
ground
must
be
true.
there
wasn't
a
proper
case
of
equity
that
therefore,
since
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
that
question
even
assuming
won't
agree
with
judge
knoch
or
would
agree,
this
isn't
the
place
to
determine
that,
but
that
can
be
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
sometimes
don't
want
to
think
all
it
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
of
your
question
of
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
we
need
no
local
law.
that's
a
different
story.
what
is
your
position
now
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
you
argue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not
before
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
why
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
i'd
like
to
--
the
same
one
i
addressed
to
mr.
doyle
when
he
comes
to
reply.
the
record
we
have
here
was
--
was
a
record
to
be
the
physical
questions
that
are
susceptible
of
physical
answers.
is
the
record
we
have
here,
the
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix

all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
you
did
say
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
number
2,
if
ever
is
--
did
the
court
of

rely
on
anything
that
i
can't
find
in
print
in
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
what
are
the
inference
of
this
brief
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
what
views
did
it
make
of
it?
for
the
record,
mr.
baker,
i
mean
this
--
i
don't
ask
you
what
if.
i
don't
ask
you
to
state
it
but
i
just
ask
you
to
give
me
--
point
out
where

the
opinion

the
court.

do
you
hold

what

what

justice

who
was
the
pretrial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me,
judge
knoch.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gale,
i
don't
see
why
you
--
why
you
argue
this
point.
if
it
appears
in
our
record,
although
nobody
had
taken
notice
of
it,
neither
judge
nor
counsel
but
if
it
appears
of
the
record
that
there
is
no
diversity,
then
this
court
must
take
notice
of
it
sua
sponte
of
its
own
motion
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
jurisdiction
warranting
we
can't
act
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
call
you
could
go
on
with
denial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
you
sit
down
mr.
--
mr.
gale
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
state
it
clearly
that
i
do
not
think
judge
knoch
ruled
on
the
question
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
i
do
not
read
his
opinion
so.
i
read
the
opposite.
what
i'd
say
is,
what
my
view
is
that
we
are
not
restricted
in
a
record
before
us
to
what
the
complain
says
or
what
judge
knoch
said
or
what
anybody
else
says
if
the
record
discloses
to
us
on
our
search
of
the
record
that
there
is
not
the
necessary
jurisdiction
of
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
view,
mr.
doyle
that
we
are
restricted
on
this
review
in
the
ascertainment
of
whether
or
not
they
were
proper
aligned
--
proper,
--
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction.
is
it
your
view
that
we
are
restricted
here
to
review
in
what
judge
knoch
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
restricted
to
the
complaint
that
we
heard
a
minute
ago,
and
you're
not
restricted
to
what
judge
knoch
found.
you
work
--
you
worked
--
the
whole
record
is
open
and
if
that
record
discloses,
i
want
a
diversity
in
this
court
without
jurisdiction
because
the
law
called
it
without
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
tried
it
out
unnoticed,
the
defendant
makes
concessions
no
matter
in
what
circumstance,
is
that
enough?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
doyle,
i'm
not
suggesting
such
as
the
fact
i
do
not
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
get
a
rule
of
law.
i
do
not
know.
i'm
at
the
slightest
notion
because
i'm
going
through
this
record.
i'm
concerned
of
the
criteria
by
which
i
must
judge
the
record.
and
i
gather
you
agree
that
i
can
go
through
the
whole
record
and
find
whether
or
not
there
is
that
diversity
by
people
on
both
sides
on
the
facts
in
this
record
which
i
may
take
account
of,
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
i've
gathered
from
what
you've
just
said
that
they
did
not
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
whole
record
below,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
gone
up
as
one
of
the
questions
to
be
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
whether
there
was
or
wasn't
diversity
jurisdiction.
was
that
not
an
issue
in
going
up
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking.
i
don't
know.
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
when
you
went
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
i
mean
that
was
not
one
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
went
up
--
the
briefs
--
i
think
there's
some
--
it's
not
wholly
good,
but
the
assignment
of
error
were
abolished
that
when
you
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
he
went
out
by
agreement
or
by
formulation,
merely
on
--
on
the
corrections
of
judge
knoch's
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
was
--
was
the
questions
of
diversity
not
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
pulled
this
off
the
sky?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
--
what
you've
said
that
is
disturbing
to
me,
if
the
record
bears
it
out.
namely,
that
the
record
was
prepared
with
reference
to
judge
knoch's
ruling
as
to
the
question
of
equity,
not
diversity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
issue
that
the
diversity
problem
wasn't
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals.
but
nevertheless,
on
a
mutilated
portion
of
the
pretrial
evidence,
they
did
rule
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
is
--
if
that
is
so,
nothing
could
be
more
disturbing
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
the
briefs
before
the
court
of
appeals,
are
they
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
all
right,
i
hope
we
can
get
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
koster
case,
mr.
doyle
as
you
well
know
this
court
speaking
from
justice
jackson
that
this
is
a
proceeding
for
public
and
corporate
interest
against
faithless
for
these
frames
against
faithfulness
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the,
i
thought
i've
already
said
i
don't
--
for
all
i
know,
you
got
it
overwhelmingly.
all
i'm
saying
is
one
searches
for
test
when
he
is
--
and
its
faithlessness
and
it's
not
error
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
faithlessness
of
those
who
reach
--
i'm
talking
about
the
faithlessness
of
those
who
control
the
policy
of
the
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
still
--
that
still
gives
--
still
gives
corporate
discretion
to
those
who
are
in
charge
of
the
corporation
to
determine
in
good
faith
the
opposite
of
faithlessness
to
determine
in
good
faith
in
the
first
place
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
cause
of
action.
in
the
second
place,
whether
as
a
matter
of
policy,
lots
of
people
have
causes
of
action
which
is
a
matter
of
policy.
they
do
not
pursue
without
being
faithless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
merely
--
merely
because
the
board
of
directors,
either
they
committed
the
act
to
the
--
to
the
--
a
sale
or
the
board
of
directors
in
charge
of
the
corporation
after
the
directors
have
committed
them
are
gone.
they
exercised
a
discretion
that
may
be
foolish,
that
may
be
unwise
but
that
isn't
enough
to
make
them
--
to
make
the
corporation
that
acts
on
such
advice
or
--
or
both
of
a
party
hostile
to
the
plaintiff,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
misunderstand
the
cases.
