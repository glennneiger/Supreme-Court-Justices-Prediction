mr.
james
e.
doyle
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
derivative
stockholders'
suit.
federal
jurisdiction
is
claimed
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
decided
that
the
principal
corporation
involved
here
had
to
be
realigned
as
the
plaintiff
rather
than
as
the
defendant
and
that
if
the
corporation
was
thus
realigned,
diversity
of
citizenship
was
absent
and
jurisdiction
was
defeated.
we,
the
plaintiffs
petitioned
for
certiorari
on
the
ground
that
the
alignment
rule,
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
jurisdictional
rule
annunciated
by
this
court
of
appeals
was
in
conflict
with
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
and
we
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
further
ground
that
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
acted
in
the
premises
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
record
and
the
status
of
the
case
as
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
we
claim
that
in
the
manner
in
which
it
acted,
the
court
of
appeals
so
far
departed
from
the
accepted
and
usual
course
of
judicial
proceedings
as
to
require
the
exercise
of
the
supervisory
powers
of
this
court.
now,
your
honors,
i
wanted
to
emphasize
that,
that
we
are
here
both
because
we
claim
a
conflict
between
the
rule
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
earlier
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
and
also
that
we
have
serious
objections
to
the
manner
in
which
the
case
came
to
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
because
in
the
statement
of
the
case
which
i
am
now
about
to
make,
i
will
be
perhaps
a
little
more
detailed
about
the
procedural
history
of
the
case
than
might
otherwise
be
true
because
it
all
has
a
bearing
upon
the
status
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
that
that
court
acted.
and
so,
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
now
to,
in
stating
the
case,
to
make
some
references
to
the
record
and
i
may
say
that
the
record
as
prepared
and
printed
here
in
--
in
the
hands
of
this
court
is
the
same
record
which
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
and
part
of
our
objections
will
relate
to
the
fact
that
we
think
that
this
record
was
inadequate
for
the
purposes
to
which
it
was
put
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
now,
this
action
as
i
have
said
was
--
is
a
stockholders'
derivative
suit
and
the
complaint
in
the
action
is
set
forth
in
the
record
here
beginning
at
page
6.
the
--
the
gist
of
the
evil
complained
of
in
the
complaint
and
it's
--
and
it's
set
out
here
at
length,
that
i'll
be
brief
about
that.
the
gist
of
the
fraudulent
conspiracy
alleged
here
is
that
the
complaint
says
that
certain
of
the
defendants
who
were
officers
and
directors
of
the
corporation,
that
is
the
chicago
north
shore
railway
company,
certain
officers
and
directors
who
are
made
defendants
and
some
who
are
not
made
defendants
here
conspired
with
others
who
had
knowledge
of
the
fraudulent
equality
of
the
conduct.
they
conspired
to
buy
up
certain
bus
properties
through
intermediate
corporations
which
they
control
to
buy
up
these
bus
companies
cheap
and
to
resell
them
dear
to
their
own
corporation,
realizing
a
profit
on
that
transaction
that's
alleged
of
about
a
million
and
a
quarter
dollars.
that
is
the
wrong
complained
of
by
the
stockholders.
now,
the
stockholders
set
forth
in
their
complaint
here
that
they
went
to
the
corporation,
went
to
--
went
to
those
in
control
of
the
corporation.
in
1949,
these
wrongs
alleged
had
--
had
occurred
over
a
period
from
about
1945
to
1948.
the
plaintiffs
went
to
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation,
the
railway
company
in
1949
and
they
demanded
that
this
action
be
brought
by
the
corporation.
at
pages
6
and
7
of
the
record,
the
court
will
observe
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
with
respect
to
the
--
this
demand
and
what
the
result
of
the
demand
was.
and
those
allegations
are
extremely
important
for
purposes
of
testing
the
ultimate
jurisdictional
rule
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
to
summarize
those,
i
may
say
that
the
--
the
allegations
on
page
6
and
7
of
the
record,
the
allegations
and
the
complaint,
do
comply
fully,
we
assert,
with
the
requirements
of
rule
23
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
they
do
contain
all
of
the
necessary
allegations
required
by
that
rule.
they
alleged
that
these
--
this
complaint
alleges
that
the
demand
was
made
upon
this
board
of
directors,
that
the
corporation
bring
the
action,
that
the
demand
was
refused,
that
even
had
the
corporation
commenced
the
action
under
those
circumstances,
control
of
the
action
would
have
been
in
hostile
hands
that
this
--
that
this
action
is
founded
on
allegations
of
fraudulent
conspiracy
joined
in
by
several
members
of
the
railway
company's
present
board
of
directors.
that
the
secure
action
by
the
stockholders
would
have
required
a
proxy
fight
with
management
in
order
to
elect
a
new
board
of
directors.
that
the
railway
company's
side
of
that
proxy
fight
would
be
financed
by
the
railway
company
and
the
general
allegation
required
by
rule
23
(b),
that
this
action
is
not
a
collusive
one
and
designed
to
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts,
which
they
would
not
otherwise
enjoy.
now,
the
body
of
the
complaint,
pages
8
on
through
17,
contains
detailed
description
about
the
--
the
interlocking
relationships
among
the
various
defendants,
business,
and
social,
and
family
ties
of
these
various
people.
and
the
complaint
does
allege
at
page
8,
in
paragraph
8,
that
all
of
the
defendants
herein
are
related
to
the
three
dominant
defendants
who
are
named
there
by
natural
ties
or
close
business
and
social
connection.
now,
those
are
the
allegations
of
--
of
the
complaint
which
later
became
important
as
the
case
proceeded.
that
complaint
was
filed
in
january
of
1950
and
i
may
say
here
that
the
plaintiffs
are
individual
citizens
of
the
state
of
nevada.
the
principal
corporation
involved,
the
railway
company,
is
a
citizen
of
illinois.
the
individual
alleged
wrongdoers,
i'll
refer
to
them
as
the
--
as
the
wrongdoers,
individual
wrongdoers,
are
citizens
of
the
state
of
illinois.
among
this
group
of
alleged
wrongdoers,
there
were
two
corporations
as
well.
one
of
them,
an
indiana
corporation
and
another,
a
delaware
corporation
both
of
which
were
licensed
to
do
business
in
illinois
and
amenable
to
process
there.
and
i
believe
that
i
do
know
violence
to
the
issues
here
when
--
for
purposes
of
simplification,
i
say,
that
the
action
was
brought
by
citizens
of
nevada,
these
minority
stockholders
against
individual
citizens
of
illinois.
and
the
principal
corporation;
the
railway
company,
joined
as
a
defendant,
citizen
of
illinois.
and
therefore,
on
the
alignment
as
it
appeared
in
the
complaint,
there
was
complete
diversity
and
--
of
citizenship,
and
federal
jurisdiction
obtained.
now,
that
complaint
was
filed
in
january
1950,
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
in
january
of
1950.
in
december
of
1950
some
of
the
defendants
made
a
motion
to
dismiss.
that
motion
to
dismiss
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record
and
as
stated,
and
as
argued
at
that
time
in
the
district
court
the
motion
raised
several
questions,
including
among
those
possibly
pertinent
here,
including
the
question
of
collusion.
that
motion
said
--
the
motion
asserted
that
there
had
been
collusion
between
these
plaintiffs,
citizens
of
nevada
and
those
in
charge
of
the
railway
company
to
--
by
which
the
railway
company
defined
to
take
the
action
and
the
nevada
citizens
brought
it,
and
that
that
was
a
collusive
effort
to
--
to
infer
a
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts.
now,
that
motion
to
dismiss
was
briefed
and
argued,
and
then
after
a
considerable
discussion
and
consideration,
the
district
court
over
which
judge
barnes
then
presided,
overruled
the
motions
to
dismiss.
he
filed
no
written
memorandum
but
he
stated
his
opinion
from
the
bench
and
the
pertinent
portion
of
that
opinion
appears
at
pages
3
and
4
of
the
record.
and
i
invite
the
courts
attention
to
that
opinion,
near
the
bottom
of
page
3.
i
won't
--
although,
it's
brief,
i
won't
read
it
but
i
--
i
think
if
the
court
will
glance
at
it
you
will
see
that
what
judge
barnes
said
in
effect
was
that
he
was
not
going
to
decide
the
question
of
collusion
or
the
question
of
realignment
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings.
that
instead
he
felt
that
the
issues,
the
factual
issues
that
underlay
those
questions
should
be
tried
out
fully
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
came
on,
on
affidavit
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--
it
says,
sir,
and
--
and
some
depositions
were
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
now,
judge
barnes
indicated
that
the
appropriate
--
that
that
was
not
the
appropriate
time
to
decide
these
questions
and
that
they
should
be
tried
out.
but
he
entered
that
order,
overruling
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
may
of
1951.
and
he
directed
the
defendants
to
answer
and
said
that
they
could
raise
this
same
--
the
same
objections
in
their
answers,
which
they
did.
thereafter,
and
--
and
during
this
interval
there
was
considerable
pretrial
work
and
--
and
efforts
to
--
to
clarify
the
issues.
but
in
december
of
1953,
that's
almost
four
years
after
this
action
had
been
commenced.
in
december
of
1953,
one
of
the
defendants
who
had
not
previously
moved
for
dismissal
then
moved
for
dismissal,
december
of
1953.
and
the
court
granted
that
defendant
permission
to
move
for
dismissal
at
that
time
and
then
granted
the
motion
for
dismissal.
by
that
time
a
district
judge
was
presiding
--
a
different
judge
was
presiding
in
the
district
court,
judge
knoch.
and
his
memorandum
opinion
in
which
he
--
in
which
he
upheld
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
did
dismiss
this
action,
it
appears
at
283
of
the
record.
now,
i
invite
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
judge
knoch,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
stated
basis
of
that
motion,
your
honor
--
just
a
moment
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
--
no,
sir.
i
hesitate
because
that
is
a
possible
matter
of
dispute
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--
and
the
--
the
motion
was
--
the
argument
made
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
with
respect
to
collusion
and
not
with
respect
to
alignment,
but
with
respect
to
the
equitable
right
to
bring
this
action.
and
it
was
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
that's
a
correct
statement
of
it.
yes,
sir,
it
did
not
touch
the
diversity
problem.
it
assumed
that
--
either
for
--
for
purposes
of
the
motion,
it
assumed
that
diversity
jurisdiction
existed
but
said
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action
or
grounds
for
equitable
relief.
and
judge
knoch
granted
the
motion
and
in
his
opinion
he
stated
that
the
reason
for
granting
the
motion
and
dismissing
the
case
was
that
the
defendant
--
that
--
that
the
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
make
out
a
case
for
equitable
relief.
and
the
ground
on
which
he
placed
it,
the
specific
ground
was
that
the
complaint
failed
to
allege
that
the
refusal
by
the
directors
in
1949
to
bring
this
action
themselves,
(inaudible)
to
make
out
that
that
refusal
was
itself
wrongful
or
as
he
said,
either
in
bad
faith,
or
ultra
vires,
or
something
else.
and
he
asserted
it
to
be
a
rule
and
from
the
citations
that
appears
that
he's
asserted
to
be
a
rule
of
federal
law,
that
there
is
a
requirement
in
stockholder
suits
that
you
must
not
only
allege
the
--
the
wrong,
the
fraud
complained
of
but
you
must
further
allege
that
when
you
ask
the
board
of
directors
to
bring
an
action
to
get
their
secret
profit
back,
that
the
refusal
by
the
board
of
directors
to
bring
that
action
is
itself
wrongful.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
dismissed
to
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
and
that
was
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
true.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
complaint
in
this
case
did
not
allege
how
many
--
how
many
directors
there
were
in
1949
or
who
they
were.
and
it
did
not
specify
who
they
were
and
what
their
connection
was
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
did
contain
the
allegations
which
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago
about
hostility,
about
the
fact
that
if
the
action
had
been
brought
by
the
corporation,
it
would
have
been
in
hostile
hands.
it
did
say
that
several
of
the
directors
were
involved
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
only
insofar
as
it
bears
on
the
action
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
in
--
how
it
took
in
the
circumstances
under
which
it
acts
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
we
appealed
from
the
order
of
judge
knoch
dismissing
the
complaint
and
as
this
record
shows,
we
designated
as
the
proper
items
to
be
included
in
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
designated
the
complaint,
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
those
things.
we
--
we
treated
it
as
if
this
had
been
a
demurrer
and
claimed
that
the
record
on
the
--
to
the
court
of
appeals
should
include
only
those
matters
appropriate
to
a
ruling
on
a
demurrer.
and
it
was
later
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
counsel
who
made
the
motion,
the
successful
motion
in
the
district
court,
that
they
did
consider
a
demurrer
and
that
that
was
a
proper
way
to
treat
it.
also,
however,
the
defendants
and
the
respondents
on
that
appeal
designated
as
portions
of
the
record,
all
of
the
other
material
that
you
now
find
in
this
printed
records.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
answers
--
portions
of
depositions
abstracted
by
counsel
and
made
as
an
appendix
to
a
brief
in
the
district
court,
affidavits
by
the
general
counsel
for
the
railroad
company
and
other
items
which
are
now
in
this
printed
record
and
which
were
in
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
which
have
never
been
the
subject
of
findings
by
the
district
court.
and
that's
the
essence
of
our
objection
about
that.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
--
i
believe
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
this
--
in
this
material,
in
the
record
at
the
instance
of
the
respondents
there
is
--
there
are
assertions
and
statements
that
do
bear
on
that
question,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
that
also
bear
on
the
question
of
alignment
that
is
ultimately
decided.
so
they
--
we
can't
say
that
they
are
irrelevant
to
the
issues
but
we
do
say
that
they
are
incomplete
and
fragmentary.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
and
i'll
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--
come
to
that
right
now
if
i
may.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
he
doesn't
say
that
a
--
that
the
rule
required
it
and
the
rule
doesn't
require
it
but
he
says
that
something
outside
the
rule
requires
that.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
he
cited
federal
decisions,
not
precisely
in
point
we
thought
but--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
under
the
rule
--
under
the
rule,
i
mean
it's
not
required
by
the
rule.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
is
what
now
comes
here
in
the
record.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct
and
that's
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
now,
we
appeal
from
the
--
from
judge
knoch's
order
of
dismissal
on
the
--
on
the
ground
that
i
have
referred
to,
the
--
the
ground
of
equity,
the
equitable
rule
that
he
--
that
he
declared.
we
appeal
from
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
record
was
made
up
as
i've
indicated,
we
saying,
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
record
of
demurrer
and
the
respondents
feeling
otherwise.
and
then
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
believe
i
should
say
in
fairness
to
our
opponents
here
that
they're
suggestion
about
that
is
that
there
were
very
considerable
pretrial
procedures
during
that
interval,
between
judge
barnes'
decision
and
judge
knoch's
decision.
and
i
believe
their
contention
is
that
those
pretrial
procedures,
admissions
made,
positions
taken
in
briefs
and
in
oral
argument,
affidavits,
portions
of
depositions
and
all
that
was
--
was
adequate
for
purposes
within
the
pretrial
discretion
of
a
judge
to
come
to
a
conclusion
and
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
this
ground.
and
that
that
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
our
position.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
now,
i
remind
the
court,
however,
that
judge
knoch's
holding
was
not
on
a
diversity
point
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--
yes,
sir.
now,
to
where
get
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
arguments
were
made
with
the
--
in
the
light
of
our
respective
views
of
what
had
happened
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
entered
its
decision.
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
that
decision
which
this
court
is
now
asked
to
review.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
this
action
was
properly
dismissed
but
it
did
not
affirm
the
dismissal
on
the
ground
of
the
law
of
equity
that
judge
knoch
said,
that
judge
knoch
had
chosen.
it
affirmed
the
dismissal
on
a
separate
and
distinct
ground
to
wit,
that
the
corporation,
the
railway
company
was
improperly
aligned.
that
it
should
have
been
aligned
as
a
plaintiff.
that
if
aligned
as
a
plaintiff,
diversity
of
jurisdiction
was
absent.
and
that
was
the
holding
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
arrived
at
that
holding
on
in
two
ways.
number
one,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
complaint
itself
as
we
urged
that
it
should
do.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
complaint
itself
and
found
that
the
complaint
was
wanting.
and
they
said
it
--
in
effect
they
said
that
the
complaint
was
wanting
because
it
failed
to
show
that
with
respect
to
the
board
of
directors
in
1949
at
the
time
of
the
refusal
to
sue,
it
failed
to
show
that
that
board
of
directors
acted
in
a
--
in
a
context
of
a
situation
where
domination
by
the
wrongdoers
or
--
or
hostility,
or
antagonism,
or
certain
other
terms
that
have
been
developed
in
the
cases,
whether
those
things
were
present
or
whether
on
the
contrary
the
board
of
directors
who
--
was
simply
exercising
its
sound
judgment
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
suit
should
be
brought
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
two
notions
coincided
but
judge
koch's
--
judge
knoch
had
said,
not
that
that
was
a
jurisdictional
point
but
that
assuming
that
jurisdiction
existed
in
the
federal
court,
that
that
was
a
hurdle
which
one
had
to
overcome
in
order
to
bring
a
stockholder
suit.
this
holding
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
failure
to
show
that
the
refusal
to
sue
was
wrongful
in
some
way
or
other
that
that
raised
a
jurisdictional
problem.
that
was
about
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
it
--
we
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
we
suggest
that
the
question
of
proper
alignment
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
not
--
does
not
necessarily
turn
on
the
same
requirement
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
oh,
no
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
then
found
that
judge
knoch
was
correct
in
the
ground
which
he
chose
and
affirmed
on
that
ground,
it
--
it
would
be
free
to
affirm
on
that
ground.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
i
may
say,
your
honor,
in
that
connection,
we
sought
review
of
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
a
jurisdictional
and
alignment
problem.
in
our
brief,
we
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
of
now,
seven
years
and
two
months
have
passed
since
our
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court.
and
that
while
we
understand
the
rule
of
this
court
is
that
we
may
not
raise
questions,
not
raised
by
our
petition
for
certiorari
we
request
in
our
briefs
the
opportunity
if
the
court
desires
it
to
brief
the
judge
knoch
question
of
whether
there
is
this
rule
of
equity
in
the
hopes
that
the
action
that
this
support
may
help
to
facilitate
a
disposition
of
the
case.
but
i
don't
pursue
that
now
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
he
thought
they
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action
was
that
in
order
--
he
says
in
order
to
state
a
cause
of
action
for
equitable
relief
in
a
stockholder's
derivative
suit,
you
must
show
that
the
refusal
to
sue
by
the
corporation
was
itself
wrongful.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
--
judge
--
judge
knoch
purported
to
base
his
decision
on
the
complaint.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
what
he
purported
to
do,
although,
we
assert
that
the
opinion
discloses
that
he
did
actually
look
beyond
the
complaint.
and
--
and
if
i
may
say
so,
sir,
in
that
connection
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
claim
that
it
should
have
been
treated
as
a
demurrer.
but
that
if
the
--
court
did
intend
to
look
beyond
the
complaint,
that
then
it
should
have
been
treated
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
is
provided
for
in
the
rules
and
that
we
should
have
got
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
how
to
answer
that
question
fairly,
i
believe
that
these
materials,
might,
under
the
respondents
view
raise
such
a
fact
question.
but
the
--
but
the
question
was
not
defined
or
articulated
in
those
terms
and
they're
--
never
was
treated
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
when
we
argued
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
--
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
if
that's
the
rule.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
a
ground
other
than
the
ground
on
which
judge
knoch
--
which
judge
knoch
chose
and
it
decided
on
two
grounds,
number
one,
that
the
complaint
failed
to
--
to
make
out
that
this
refusal
was
sufficiently
wrongful
or
that
there
was
a
sufficient
antagonism,
or
hostility,
or
domination,
or
whatever
--
whatever
it
is
to
justify
alignment
of
the
corporation
as
a
defendant.
but
it
should
have
been
realigned
in
that
we
were
out
for
that
reason
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
but
the
court
of
appeals
then
went
on
to
consider
whether
there
were
items
in
the
record,
beyond
the
complaint
that
bore
on
this
question
of
antagonism
and
hostility,
and
domination.
and
there
we
claimed
that
the
court
of
appeals
undertook
in
the
decision
of
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
will
reflect
it.
the
court
of
appeals
undertook
to
examine
the
answer
by
the
railway
company,
an
affidavit
by
the
counsel
for
the
railway
company,
statements
and
oral
argument,
briefs
and
all
kinds
of
things
which
we
consider
were
entirely
inappropriate
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
adverted
to.
counsel
contends,
and
opposing
counsel
contends
in
its
brief
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
beyond
the
complaint
to
these
other
things
only
because
we
asked
them
to.
but
i
assure
the
court
that
that
is
not
the
fact.
we
took
the
consistent
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
should
be
treated
as
a
demurrer.
only
in
our
reply
brief
when
we
had
been
faced
with
further
contentions
there,
we
said
that
even
if
it
were
not
to
be
treated
as
a
demurrer,
and
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
free
then
to
look
beyond
the
complaint
at
other
things
in
this
spotty
and
fragmentary
record
we
said
even
then,
it
would
disclose
that
there
had
been
hostility
and
antagonism
on
the
part
of
the
corporation.
now,
i
--
i
may
say
just
lest
our
silence
on
this
point
in
this
court
be
misconstrued,
we
believe
that
if
we
have
the
opportunity
and
the
appropriate
court
to
try
out
the
issues
of
fact
that
unerlie
this
jurisdictional
question,
that
is
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
hostility,
or
antagonism,
or
domination.
if
we
are
given
that
opportunity,
we
believe
that
we
can
make
that
showing
but
we
feel
that
we
have
never
been
permitted
to
make
it
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
our
complaint,
insufficiently
alleged
it.
and
then
it
was
wrong
in
going
beyond
the
complaint
in
this
state
of
the
record
in
order
to
make
determinations
of
fact
for
the
first
time
in
that
court.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
was
not
requested,
no,
sir.
now,
your
honor,
i
had
hoped
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
i
think
i'll
save
it.
may
i
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
i've
never
reached
the
jurisdictional
question,
which
i'm
sure
the
court
is
interested
in
perhaps
in
rebuttal
of
the
--
if
we
are
able
to
do
so.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
your
honor,
i
do
understand
that
the
court
contended
that
each
side
should
have
a
little
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
devote
just
a
few
moments
in
this
portion
of
my
argument
to
the
matters,
which
the
court
had
just
been
--
about
which
the
court
has
just
been
questioning
counsel
about
what
happened
procedurally
in
this
case.
and
then,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
state
our
position
about
what
the
rule
of
alignment
should
be
in
--
that
governs
in
this
diversity
cases
but
still
speaking
now
about
the
procedural
history
of
the
case.
i
wish
first
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
record,
page
261.
261
of
the
record
is
the
motion
by
bernard
j.
fallon
by
his
attorneys
and
that's
the
motion
on
which
judge
knoch
ruled.
no
other
motion,
not
motions
that
were
made
and
overruled
by
judge
barnes
two
and
a
half
or
almost
two
and
half
years
earlier,
but
this
motion
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
sir.
the
point
i
just
made
was
in
response
to
what
i
believe
was
in
the
accurate
statement
made
to
the
court
by
counsel
that
there
was
something
more
before
judge
knoch
than
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
moving
party
conceded
was
a
demurrer.
that's
what
he
considered
he
was
doing,
was
demurring
and
that's
what
judge
knoch
passed
on.
now,
your
honor,
if
i
may
respond
next
to
the
suggestion
which
--
with
which
i
agree
that
at
any
time
at
any
court,
district
court,
court
of
appeals
or
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
discovers
on
the
phase
of
the
record
that
there
is
a
jurisdiction
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
all
of
the
record,
that
there
is
a
jurisdictional
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
sir?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
i
would
concede
that
that's
the
fact
that
any
court,
or
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
might
look
at
the
complaint
alone
and
decide
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
insufficient
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
that
either
they
are
insufficient
or
they're
not
sufficient.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
exactly
and
--
and
no
court,
no
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
your
honor,
the
deposition
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
the
deposition
that
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
that
this
court
or
any
court
may
examine
any
proper
record
and
find
out
whether
there
is
some
jurisdictional
defect.
and
i
--
and
now,
i
want
to
say
though
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
black
and
the
whole
court
that
what
has
happened
here
is,
and
this
is
the
literal
truth
about
this
record,
a
brief,
--
let's
go
back
to
1951.
this
is
the
motion
to
dismiss
before
judge
barnes
which
judge
barnes
overruled
way
back
there.
a
brief
was
filed
by
the
defendants
who
mr.
baker's
firm
represents.
attached
to
that
brief
was
an
affidavit
by
counsel,
mr.
baker,
to
the
affect
that
he
had
examined
the
depositions
taken
up
to
that
point
and
he
selected
and
i'm
not
suggesting
anything
improper
about
this.
and
for
the
purpose,
he
selected
from
those
depositions
certain
portion
of
the
deposition.
that's
what's
in
this
printed
record
in
this
court
and
nothing
else,
nothing
else.
no
--
no
--
they're
not
all
a
deposition.
and
--
and
your
honor,
it
isn't
as
if
what
suggested
here
jurisdictionally
is
that
suddenly
here
in
the
supreme
court,
the
court
itself
notices
that
--
that
one
of
these
plaintiffs
is
not
a
citizen
of
nevada
but
it's
actually
a
citizen
of
illinois
or
some
gross
jurisdiction
defect
of
that
kind.
what's
suggested
here
is
that
on
the
rules
of
alignment,
whether
or
not
there
is
this
sufficient
antagonism
as
between
the
plaintiffs
and
those
in
control
of
the
corporation,
that
--
that's
the
jurisdictional
defect
that's
suggested.
and
it's
--
with
respect
to
that
question,
that
counsel
here
now
seeks
just
to
page
through
excerpts
of
depositions,
which
they
themselves
pick
and
find
things
which
they
suggest
our
admissions
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
this
hostility
occur.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
correct,
definitely.
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
wasn't
the
holding
in
the
district
court
nor
was
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
oh
no,
no
sir,
that
the
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
only
in
the
sense
that
jurisdiction
is
always
open
in
the
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
no
definitely
not.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
we
went
up
on
that
--
on
that
ground
and
that's
what
we
--
when
we
said
judge
knoch
was
wrong
in
saying
that
that
there's
this
rule
of
equity.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
oh,
no,
no
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
no,
no
i
beg
your
pardon.
now,
that
--
that's
what
judge
knoch
held.
we
objected
to
judge
knoch's
holding
and
appealed
from
his
ruling.
we
designated
portions
of
the
record
of
--
with
our
view
that
this
was
a
demurrer.
counsel
designated
additional
portions
and
then
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
raised
that
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
took
the
position
that
in
order
to
dismiss
the
complaint
can
be
sustained
on
any
one
of
a
number
of
--
of
questions,
and
one
that
judge
knoch
or
the
jurisdictional
question
or
will
attack
on
a
processes
of
the
bankruptcy
court
which
is
another
thing
in
the
background
here.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
was
by
the
appellants,
by
us.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that
is
the
point,
and
your
honor
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
the
court
understands
the
disturbance
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
as
about
what
happened
here
and
--
and
your
honor,
i
--
let
me
just
add
this
about
that.
i
believe
that
the
respondents
were
entirely
free
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
contend
as
they
did,
that
any
one
of
a
number
of
grounds
would
sustain
the
order
of
dismissal
below.
i
believe
that's
good
law
including
this
fact
that
there
was
improper
alignment.
that
was
a
proper
thing
for
them
to
raise
there.
but
if
that
was
what
disturbed
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
said,
“there
are
factual
questions
underlying
this
alignment
thing.
we'll
send
it
back
for
the
district
court
and
let
the
district
court
--
let
everybody
square
off
here
on
the
factual
questions
that
--
that
underline
the
alignment
problem
and
let
the
district
court
have
a
hearing
and
let
people
produce
what
they
will
on
that
point
and
let
the
district
court
make
its
findings.”
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
not
296,
your
honor,
our
designation
is
back
at
292.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
your
honor,
we
took
the
position
--
may
i
be
excused
for
just
a
moment
to
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
if
--
if
your
honor,
we
believe
we
did
take
the
consistent
position
that
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
a
demurrer
record.
the
appellees
did
include
other
items.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
understand
now
from
our
counsel
of
record,
mr.
scolnik,
that
the
stimulation
to
which
you
refer
is
a
stipulation
to
the
effect
that
the
originals
of
certain
deposition
may
be
used
very
well
in
copies
and
that's
all,
and
we
didn't
intend
to
concede
anything
about
the
propriety
of
having
those
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
in
our
replied
brief.
we
--
we
briefed
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
true.
that's
correct,
but
we
--
we
did
not
consider
that
that
was
the
appropriate
place
to
argue
the
facts
about
the
jurisdictional
question.
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
uncommon
on
the
petitioners
to
express
their
views
of
the
law
involved
in
this
--
the
rule
of
law
involved
here
about
the
alignment
and
the
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
proceed
to
that.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
everything
that
has
been
said
in
connection
with
this
argument
about
what
happened
procedurally
in
the
case,
in
everything
that
we
have
said
here
as
to
whether
the
complaint
is
sufficient.
in
all
of
that,
we
have
proceeded
on
the
--
we
have
accepted
for
that
purpose
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
requirement
for
alignment
purposes
that
there
must
be
some
wrongful
--
something
wrongful
about
the
refusal
to
sue
that
as
counsel
here
conceded
that
there
--
that
there
must
--
that
the
plaintiffs
must
show
some
improper
motives
on
the
part
of
those
who
refused
the
suit,
and
we‘ve
conceded
that.
i
say
we
assumed
that
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
up
to
here
and
we
have
contended
that
our
complaint
needs
that
requirement
if
there
is
such
a
requirement,
that
the
--
that
is
that
there
was
a
sufficient
hostility
and
that
there
is
domination
and
so
on
and
we
refer
to
things
in
the
complaint
which
we
think
carried
that
out.
we
do
in
our
brief
contend
and
i
want
to
state
the
contention
here
that
it
is
not
the
law
as
decided
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
or
by
this
court
through
the
rule
making
power
or
in
any
other
way.
it
is
not
the
law
that
the
plaintiffs
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction,
for
purposes
of
alignment,
proper
alignment
of
the
corporation
must
either
allege
or
prove
improper
motives
on
the
part
of
the
directors
in
their
refusal
to
sue.
we
do
--
now,
i
want
to
say
at
this
point
that
we
do
not
concede
that
that's
the
law,
and
we
believe
that
the
law
is
--
and
the
only
requirement
for
purposes
of
alignment
and
jurisdictional
diversity
purposes,
the
only
requirement
is
that
the
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
directors
to
sue
must
be
real,
not
feign.
real,
not
feign
and
we
quote
that
language
several
times
in
our
briefs.
it
comes
from
doctor
and
harrington
quoting
it
i
believe
from
dodge
and
woolsey
which
is
the
--
the
beginning
leading
case
reading
in
point
of
time
in
this
whole
series
of
cases.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir,
but
the
word
“hostility”
or
“antagonism”,
we
--
we
would
suggest
there's
a
better
word
that
there
is
in
truth
a
conflict,
not
a
--
not
a
collusive
one.
they're
not
a
collusive
situation
but
that
there
is
in
truth
a
conflict
between
these
plaintiff's
stockholders
and
the
management
of
the
corporation
as
to
whether
or
not
this
suit
should
be
brought.
now,
i
don't
suggest,
your
honor,
it
is
the
moment
i
don't
suggest
that
i'm
talking
now
about
the
equitable
basis
for
a
stockholder
suit
once
you're
in
court.
that's
a
separate
question
on
which
we
would
like
some
time
to
be
heard
in
this
case,
but
--
but
i'm
saying
that
for
purposes
of
alignment
and
for
the
application
of
the
rule
of
the
indianapolis
case
or
for
any
of
the
cases
that
i've
held
that
there
must
be
a
genuine
difference
that
separates
this
plaintiff's
stockholders
from
the
corporation.
for
those
purposes,
i
say
that
the
question
must
be
whether
the
refusal
was
real
and
not
feign,
your
honor.
now,
we
cite
as
one
authority
for
that
proposition
a
case
decided
by
this
court,
chicago
against
mills
in
204
u.s.two
years
after
doctor
and
harrington
which
we
believe
is
a
wholly,
and
which
we
believe
it
was
necessary
to
a
holding
in
a
case
and
it
was
a
jurisdictional
case
that
this
proposition
be
recognized.
in
other
words,
in
chicago
against
mills,
the
directors
had
refused
--
the
directors
of
a
utility
company
in
chicago
had
refused
to
bring
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
certain
rate
regulation
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
it
was
admitted.
i
shouldn't
say
admitted.
it
was
in
the
pleadings
that
the
reason
they
refused
to
bring
the
suit
was
they
thought
that
if
they
brought
such
a
suit,
they'd
get
in
trouble
with
the
city
council
of
chicago
and
that
the
mayor
would
get
after
him
and
that
they'd
have
a
of
political
trouble
in
chicago.
so,
they
decided
for
what
the
court
called
prudential
reasons,
not
to
--
not
to
bring
the
action.
the
plaintiff's
stockholder
from
another
state
then
brought
the
action.
there
was
a
long
and
it
involves
procedural
history
of
that
case
too.
ultimately,
it
came
to
this
court
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
you'll
understand
there's
no
suggestion
of
hostility
on
the
part
of
the
directors
who
refused
the
suit
toward
the
plaintiff
who
brought
it,
but
only
a
genuine
disagreement,
and
--
and
it
was
also
suggested
of
course
by
the
defense
that
this
was
collusive.
the
collusion
question
was
--
was
explored
below
and
also
explored
in
the
supreme
court,
and
they
held
there
was
no
collusion,
and
then
the
court
held
that
there
was
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
or
the
purpose
of
where
the
corporation
should
be
aligned
and
then
you
apply
the
diversity
rule
and
you
either
admit
it
or
you
don't.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case
allegedly.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
oh,
but
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
the
faithless
directors
who
committed
the
fraud,
not
the
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
your
honor,
the
problem
in
this
case
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
composition
of
the
board
of
directors
changed
somewhat
between
the
time
that
the
wrongs
were
complained
of
and
the
time
when
the
demand
was
made.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
justice
jackson
surely
meant
in
the
context
of
that
opinion
that
the
stockholder
suit
is
a
device
to
redress
wrongs
by
faithless
directors
who
commit
frauds
against
the
corporation,
and
that's
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about
if
we
ever
get
to
it.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
but
--
but
on
your
point,
your
honor
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
--
that's
not
what
the
court
decided
in
chicago
against
mills
two
years
after
doctor
and
harrington,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
and
may
i
say
one
word
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes
sir,
if
the
disagreement
between
the
--
a
plaintiff
stockholder
and
the
director
is
genuine.
then
for
the
alignment
purposes
--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
our
position,
your
honor,
but
if
i
may
just
add
one
word
and
i'll
stop
here.
the
--
we
have
--
scrupulously,
i
believe
it's
true,
a
discussion
of
facts
which
we
do
not
think
are
appropriate
to
the
consideration
of
this
case
in
this
court.
what
i
cannot
in
the
face
of
what's
been
said
particularly
by
mr.
gale
stopped
my
argument
without
just
making
this
statement
which
i'll
term
a
sort
of
an
offer
of
proof.
if
we
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
try
the
jurisdictional
facts
that
underline
the
alignment
question,
we
believe
that
we
can
show
that
a
majority
of
the
directors
as
of
1949
when
the
refusal
to
sue
occurred.
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
we
can
link
that
up
and
show
that
five
of
nine
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy
alleged.
do
you
want
these
briefs
your
honor?
mr.
james
e.
doyle
all
right,
sir.
