mr.
marland
gale
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
essence,
a
derivative
stockholder
bringing
an
action
must
allege
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
the
defendant
corporation
is
captive
in
the
hands
of
the
miller
factors
and
i
think
that
is
not
alleged
in
substance
here.
there
was
a
confusion
between
--
in
the
language
between
the
allegations
among
defendants
who
are
not
directors.
my
client
never
was
a
director,
never
had
any
interest,
neither
had
a
one
who
represent
him
on
the
board.
he
knew
no
part
about
what
happened
at
the
board
meeting
when
this
action
was
declined
by
the
board.
i'd
like
to
make
one
comment
to
--
in
reply
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
when
judge
knoch
heard
these
motions,
he
also
renewed
and
heard
the
motions
on
realignment.
so
that
was
before
the
court
--
mr.
marland
gale
he
heard
them.
he
reheard
them
at
the
same
time
and
he
had
before
him
all
the
material.
and
then,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
of
why
didn't
they
amend?
they
didn't
amend
because
they
couldn't.
at
the
hearing
before
judge
knoch,
we
challenged
them
to
amend
and
to
make
good
allegations
and
they
couldn't
do
it
because
by
that
time
as
they
knew
and
we
had
established
from
their
own
admissions
over
the
course
of
depositions
and
a
year
and
a
half
of
pretrial.
now,
these
may
be
non-satisfactory
records
here,
but
it's
a
record
in
which
their
great
deal
of
work
and
effort
has
been
done
and
a
great
many
hearings
have
been
held
before
the
pretrial
court.
and
the
kind
of
facts
which
i
--
i
am
now
going
to
address
myself
with
the
power
of
the
court
to
listen
or
look
at
the
facts
in
the
record.
where
do
they
come
from?
not
from
my
client's
statements,
not
from
these
gentlemen's
client's
statements.
they
come
from
the
plaintiff,
unless
that
the
word
extraordinary
case
on
the
facts,
on
admissions.
now,
i
submit
that
if
a
man
admits
himself
out
of
court,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
trial
after
that
to
see
whether
what
the
facts
argue,
no.
it's
just
as
if
he
had
put
it
in
the
pleading.
now,
the
defect
of
his
pleading
which
is
unamendable
was
shown
by
the
concessions
of
the
plaintiff
and
his
own
personal
counsel
that
was
on
the
board,
and
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
company,
and
the
man
who
dominated
the
board
was
the
plaintiff's
man.
the
plaintiff
himself
plainly
came
into
the
case
--
mr.
marland
gale
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
marland
gale
the
basis
of
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
pages
10
to
11
that
--
the
13
of
each
--
each
facts
stated
there
comes
out
of
the
mouth
of
mr.
crummer,
the
plaintiff
or
his
personal
counsel
mr.
whitehair.
mr.
marland
gale
no,
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
--
mr.
marland
gale
it's
all
in
the
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
marland
gale
oh,
yes.
mr.
marland
gale
it
was
in
the
record
before
the
district
court.
over
those
long
pretrial
hearings,
he
was
made
clearly
familiar
with
these
facts.
and
there
was
never
any
--
mr.
marland
gale
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
marland
gale
judge
knoch.
mr.
marland
gale
judge
knoch,
yes.
we
did
a
lot
of
sifting
down.
now,
i
submit
that
if
that
kind
of
a
long
procedure
is
disregarded
as
you're
just
rendering
nugatory,
all
the
discovery
and
pretrial
proceedings
or
one
who
would
be
doing
that
which
have
been
so
carefully
developed
to
help
simplify
issues
and
reduce
a
trial.
i
don't
think
that
pretrial
procedures
necessarily
must
follow
--
must
result
on
a
trial.
every
single
fact
on
--
from
pages
10
to
15
of
the
brief
of
national
city
lines
is
documented
in
this
record
and
it
comes
from
mr.
crummer.
mr.
crummer
claimed
before
the
directors
in
as
far
as
stockholders'
meeting,
two
months
before
the
first
demand
was
claimed,
he
claimed
and
i
quote
from
page
176
that
he
had
around
100,000
shares
he
could
deliver
of
this
company
that
had
500
hundred
shares.
"here
is
a
derivative
stockholder's
suit
by
the
biggest
stockholder.‚Äù
and
before
that,
he
wanted
to
have
representation
on
the
board.
he
went
to
mr.
francis
b.
whitehair
who
for
the
20
years
as
they
both
testified
and
sworn
that
there's
notice
read
about
this
with
mr.
crummer's
personal
attorney.
mr.
whitehair
made
arrangements
to
go
around.
he
got
on
the
board
with
another
man.
he's
elected.
in
the
short
time,
he
became
an
executive
committee.
within
about
a
year,
he
was
the
executive
vice
president
and
every
single
motion
that
was
made
to
decline
to
bring
suit
was
made
by
mr.
crummer's
personal
attorney.
that's
why
that
the
plaintiff
was
never
amended.
he
made
the
motion.
someone
else
seconded
it.
another
big
thing
that
mr.
crummer
did
right
away
was
to
reorganize
the
legal
department.
mr.
marland
gale
i
--
i
submit
--
i
submit
it's
not
a
demurrer.
mr.
marland
gale
i
submit
it's
not
a
demurrer,
your
honor.
it's
a
speaking
demurrer
or
a
summary
judgment
and
we're
entitled
--
we
were
entitled
to
put
that
in
before
the
district
court
and
we
did.
mr.
marland
gale
i'm
arguing
what
the
--
whether
on
the
hard
realities
of
this
record,
if
you're
going
to
cite
a
case
in
accordance
with
the
undisputed
facts
or
whether
you're
going
to
decide
that
honest
obstructions
of
jurisdiction
and
so
on.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
about
the
--
the
inadequacies
of
the
--
of
the
complaint
when
we
know,
but
what
if
the
plaintiff
has
told
us.
if
he
had
signed
the
supplementary
complaint
admitting
certain
things,
he'd
be
out
of
the
court.
i
think
he
--
mr.
marland
gale
i
--
i
never
concede
that,
sir.
mr.
marland
gale
right.
mr.
marland
gale
yes
sir.
mr.
marland
gale
yes,
sir.
mr.
marland
gale
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
he
was
fully
informed
and
he
said
he
was
fully
informed
in
the
matter.
now
--
mr.
marland
gale
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
didn't
--
let
me
--
let
me
find
that
again.
mr.
marland
gale
but
the
fact
is
that
--
mr.
marland
gale
i
--
i
don't
find
where
he
said
we
withdrew
anything.
mr.
marland
gale
what
page
is
that,
sir?
mr.
marland
gale
oh.
mr.
marland
gale
but
the
memorandum
opinions
--
mr.
marland
gale
well,
the
memorandum
--
mr.
marland
gale
yes.
his
memorandum
opinion
goes
farther,
but
i
submit
that
at
the
case
of
this
point
when
the
defendants
or
the
plaintiffs
have
admitted
themselves
out
of
the
court
as
i
say
they
have,
this
court
need
not
fail
to
take
those
facts
into
consideration.
mr.
marland
gale
well,
considering
--
mr.
marland
gale
--
he
had
it
before
him
and
he
came
up
result
in
our
favor.
now,
i
don't
know
what
his
mental
process
is
where
he
say
it.
mr.
marland
gale
that's
exactly
my
--
mr.
marland
gale
--
contention,
sir.
mr.
marland
gale
may
i
suggest
that
if
we're
sent
back
for
retrial,
we'll
do
exactly
the
same
thing
before
judge
knoch
who
introduced
the
same
deposition
for
the
last
readmissions
and
then
the
--
he
will
be
compelled
--
mr.
marland
gale
you
address
that
question
--
mr.
marland
gale
thank
you.
