mr.
frank
c.
mason
mr.
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
i
think
that
it
may
clarify
the
picture,
somewhat,
if
i
should
start
from
the
beginning
of
this
history
of
the
opposing
rights
of
a
common
law
suitor
as
against
this
right
of
limitation
granted
by
the
1851
statute.
this
court
in
langnes
against
green,
from
which
a
great
and
--
and
not
that
decision
from
--
that
decision
stemmed
to
great
number
of
decisions
in
the
second
circuit
under
the
southern
district
court
having
to
do
with
this
question
as
to
the
opposing
right
of
the
common
law
suitor
and
the
right
of
the
petitioner
in
limitation.
in
langnes
against
green,
this
court
cited
the
language
of
judge
brawley
in
the
case
of
the
lotta,
an
old
district
court
case
in
150
fed,
in
which
he
said,
that
the
plaintiff
had
the
right
to
pursue
his
remedy
in
the
state
court
unless
the
act
providing
for
a
limitation
of
liability
clearly
deprives
him
of
it.
and
further
said,
just
the
two
sentences,
if
the
court
please,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
be
heard
on
that
question.
that
is
and
--
and
in
the
usual
cause
of
the
common
law
proceeding,
that
issue
can
be
fairly
tried.
all
that
the
petitioner
can
fairly
claim
is
that
he
should
not
be
subject
to
a
personal
judgment
for
an
indefinite
amount
and
beyond
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
vessel
and
her
freight.
now,
the
right
of
limitation
arises
under
section
183,
which
formally
was
section
4283
of
the
revised
statutes,
and
which
says
that
the
liability
of
the
owner,
in
a
case
of
a
loss
caused
without
his
privity
or
knowledge
shall
not
exceed
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
vessel.
on
the
other
side
of
the
picture,
under
title
28,
section
1333,
we
know,
that
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
case
of
admiralty
saving
to
suitors
in
all
cases
and
all
other
remedies
to
which
they
are
otherwise
entitled.
now,
what
occurred
here
was
that
this
claimant
started
her
suit
in
supreme
court
ulster
county
(inaudible)
for
the
death
of
her
husband.
and
within
a
few
weeks,
the
restraining
--
the
petition
was
filed
then
a
restraining
order
issued.
there
was
some
preliminary
motion
there
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
the
security
which
was
posted.
my
complaint
being
at
the
outset,
that
since
we
had
sued
the
petitioner
in
the
state
court
both
as
owner
of
the
barge
and
as
of
the
tug
and
charged
her
with
negligence
with
respect
to
the
personnel
of
both
vessels,
that
it
was
--
should
have
been
required
to
put
up
a
bond
for
the
barge
as
well
as
the
tug.
the
fault
being
charged
to
the
barge,
not
relating
to
navigation,
but
to
the
fact
that
her
lights
were
inadequate,
a
very
simple
issue
as
to
the
barge.
my
first
motion
before
judge
weinfeld
was
based
on
the
premise
that
the
fund
composed
of
the
two
bonds
now
was
$283,000
and
the
claims
total
$259,000.
the
petitioner
at
that
stage
contended
that
the
fund
was
inadequate
on
this
theory.
it
said
before
judge
weinfeld
that
here
was
not
one
fund
of
$283,000
but
that
here
were
two
separate
funds,
one
for
the
tug
of
$118,000
and
another
for
the
barge
of
$165,000,
and
since
the
claims
total
$259,000,
they
said
clearly,
the
claims
exceeded
each
funds
just
the
same.
judge
weinfeld
went
along
with
that
theory,
denied
my
motion
to
lift
the
restraining
order,
the
court
gave
us
permission
to
bring
our
claims
to
an
amount
reduced
and
to
apply
as
to
petitioner's
liability
as
to
each
vessel.
with
the
result,
that
by
formal
stipulation
in
which
mrs.
henn
reduced
her
claim
against
the
tug
to
$100,000,
against
the
barge
$250,000,
the
other
claims
in
the
limitation
proceedings
never
had
to
be
reduced
although
they
were
in
greater
amounts
in
the
state
court,
they
were
always
constant
as
$9500,
therefore,
the
claims
against
petitioner's
tug
on
worth
was
only
$109,000
against
the
fund
of
$118,000
and
against
petitioner's
barge
owner
in
the
sum
of
$159,000
as
against
the
fund
of
$165,000.
i
should
mention
too
to
the
court,
all
11
claims
were
accounted
for.
there
was
no
possibility
here
that
there
would
be
some
secret
claims
appearing
later
on.
now,
judge
weinfeld,
upon
the
second
motion
then,
following
the
petitioners
own
arguments
on
the
first
motion
that
here
were
two
separate
funds
held
in
accordance
with
that
theory
lifted
the
restraining
order
because
the
fund
was
adequate
for
the
tug
and
was
adequate
for
the
barge.petitioner
then
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
complaining
against
that
holding.
although,
as
i
cite
in
my
brief,
the
language
in
judge
weinfeld's
opinion
makes
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
that
was
the
petitioner's
position
before
him
on
the
first
motion.
and
so
--
and
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
again
held,
in
line
with
what
the
petitioner
contended,
in
line
with
what
judge
weinfeld
held,
that
here,
they
would
have
to
treat
this
proceeding
as
being
composed
of
two
funds,
with
respect
to
each
of
which
the
claims
were
less
than
the
amounts
of
the
funds.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that
suit
in
the
state
court,
your
honor,
was
being
strained
off
course,
you
see,
by
the
restraining
order
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
the
one
that
puts
it
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
the
limitation
proceeding
is
solely
in
rem,
your
honor.
in
the
state
court,
we
sued
the
owner
in
personam
alleging
negligence
of
its
employees
on
the
tug
and
of
its
employees
on
the
barge,
and
in
that
state
court,
so
we
also
named
as
a
defendant
the
owner
of
the
yacht
on
board
to
which
mr.
henn
was
a
passenger
at
the
time
of
the
collision,
you
see.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
sir.
that's
--
that's
where
we
had
a
little
difficulty
in
the
beginning,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
petition,
as
you
read
it,
alleges
that
the
petitioner
owned
the
tug;
eastern
cities,
and
it
owned
the
barge
l.t.c.
no.
38,
and
it
alleged
that
the
petitioner
had
used
due
diligence
to
make
each
of
these
vessels
seaworthy,
you
see.
and
they
were
all
of
the
allegations
that
would
be
necessary
to
establish
a
right
to
file
the
petition
for
limitation,
both
with
respect
to
the
tug
and
the
barge.
but
what
was
missing
in
the
whole
picture
was
that
they
trade
for
limitation
of
the
petitioner
and
the
tug,
eastern
cities
for
getting
the
barge.
and
they
posted
a
bond
originally,
only,
on
behalf
of
the
tug
and
the
restraining
order,
we
laid
it
not
only
to
the
tug
but
as
to
all
claims
against
the
petitioner.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
made
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition
in
the
first
instance
on
the
ground
that
they
should
have
posted
security
for
the
barge.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
the
tug,
eastern
cities.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
we
had
sued
the
petitioner
in
the
state
court
in
personam,
you
see,
charging
it
with
negligence
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
you
see
that?
now
then,
when
they
got
the
restraining
order,
upon
filing
the
petition
and
the
bond,
the
restraining
order
was
against
the
--
the
prosecution
of
any
suit
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
the
court
must
have
assumed
that
there
was
of
this
reason,
because
--
because
judge
ryan
held
that
unless
they
posted
a
bond
for
the
barge
within
10
days,
then
the
restraining
order
of
which
had
been
previously
issued
would
have
no
effect
as
to
the
barge
but
only
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
and
the
tug.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.
they
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
it
is
one
proceeding
in
which
they,
themselves,
contended,
your
honor,
that
there
were
two
funds.
and
the
courts
treated
them
as
two
funds.
the
claimants
reduced
her
claims
because
the
petitioner
took
the
position
that
there
were
two
funds.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
i
think
so
for
this
reason.
the
circuit
court
said
that
and
they
contended
in
the
court
below
that
they
had
a
right
if
they
wished
to
file
a
separate
proceeding
for
each
vessel.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
they
didn't
do
that.
so
then,
they
now
take
the
position,
if
the
court
please,
having
originally
taken
the
position
that
there
were
two
funds.
now,
they
have
got
the
respondent
they
hoped
in
the
position
or
they
did
in
the
lower
court.
that
since,
here
is
a
fund
for
$118,000
and
here
is
another
one
for
$165,000,
and
the
claims
at
$259,000,
no
one
will
ever
know,
they
say,
what
is
the
true
fund
until
after
it
filed
wherefore
they
say.
this
woman
is
not
entitled
to
have
the
injunction
lifted
to
give
her
a
state
court
right
which
she
has
by
law.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
true.
therefore
--
therefore,
as
the
case
has
indicate,
that
this
court
--
neither
this
court
nor
the
circuit
court
nor
the
district
court
was
called
upon
to
fathom
ultimate
liability.
you
start
with
the
point
that
the
district
judge
in
his
discretion
determines
whether
or
not
the
fund
--
the
possible
fund,
we
call
it,
was
adequate
and
that
it
--
were
exceeded
the
amounts
of
claims
now
on
file
in
the
proceeding.
he
makes
a
preliminary
investigation
as
the
circuit
court
says
to
determine
that.
once
he
determines
by
his
preliminary
look
at
the
case
that
the
fund
exceeds
the
claims
then
concursus
does
not
enter
the
picture
and
it
is
put
squarely
to
this
court
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
petition
of
texas
and
petition
of
trinidad,
which
my
friend
refers
to,
that
absent
and
adequate
fund
--
absent
an
insufficient
fund,
i
should
say,
the
court
says,
"the
statutory
privilege
of
limiting
liability
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine,
the
statute
gives
a
ship-owner,
sued
in
several
suits,
even
in
divers
places,
by
divers
persons,
no
advantage
over
other
kinds
of
defendants
in
the
same
position."
and
all
that
comes
down
to
is
this
in
--
in
a
very
few
words,
i
think.
i
will
not,
for
one
moment,
concede
that
what
was
called
a
limitation
statute
or
limitation
act
in
1851
giving
encouragement
to
shipowners
to
this
extent
that
they
shall
not
be
liable
for
more
than
--
than
their
investment
in
the
vessel
that
that
limitation
statute
may
as
of
this
date
in
--
in
1957
be
called
a
concursus
statute.
that
in
this
day
and
age,
limitation
is
to
be
forgotten
and
that
it
is
to
be
assumed
as
my
friend
puts
it.
that
even
in
the
case
of
an
adequate
fund
that
the
shipowner
has
a
better
right
than
the
railroad
men
or
the
airline,
that
he
may
come
in
to
court
and
to
the
admiralty
court
and
say,
“i
am
being
sued
by
11
people.
i
will
admit
that
i
have
an
adequate
fund.
but
i
ask
the
court
to
give
me
a
restraining
order
and
a
limitation
proceeding.
restraining
these
suits
which
are
brought
against
me
only
because
there
is
a
multiplicity
of
suits
which
should
be
avoided."
i
would
never
go
along
with
that.
the
circuit
court
doesn't
go
along
with
it
in
a
number
of
cases.
and
judge
frank,
judge
hincks,
judge
learned
hand,
time
and
time
again,
have
refused
to
take
that
position.
in
the
case
of
langnes
against
green,
the
earlier
one
which
is
a
single
case,
single
plain
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
this
common
law
right
to
a
jury
trial
must
always
be
preserved.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh,
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
all
true,
true.
i
followed
down
too
and
you'll
see
--
and
these
decisions
which
is
cited
by
judge
frank,
your
honor,
that
you'll
find
single
claims,
you
will
find
a
single
claim
with
another
claim
comes
--
coming
in
where
the
single
claimants
who
had
been
there
before
would
stipulate
that
that
other
claim
be
paid
in
full
out
of
the
fund
in
order
that
they
would
have
their
right,
you
see.
and
then,
along
came
this
case
of
--
of
petitioner
taxes,
where
there
were
number
of
claims
and
where
the
court
held,
as
i
say,
that
you
must
and
they
take
from
langnes
against
green,
this
notion;
that
you
just
cannot
take
away
the
common
law
remedy
by
asserting
that
it
will
avoid
a
lot
of
litigation
all
over
the
country
if
i'm
permitted
to
get
that
restraining
order
in
limitation.
that
isn't
good
enough.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
now,
it
is
a
different
case
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
you
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.
i
would
like
to
say
this
to
your
honor.
you
have
used
the
word
allocation
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
--
i
think
you've
picked
that
up
from
my
friend's
brief
or
from
his
argument.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
here
is
the
difference
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
[laughs]
mr.
frank
c.
mason
here
is
the
difference,
and
mr.
underwood
and
i
have
had
this
out
in
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
circuit
court
three
times
now.
when
mrs.
henn
filed
her
original
claim,
it
was
for
$250,000.
when
they
contended
that
there
were
two
separate
funds
here,
as
it
happened,
she
said,
“i
have
a
claim
against
the
tug
petitioner
for
$100,000
and
against
the
petitioner's
barge
owner
for
$450,000
and
i'm
sorry
now
that
i
didn't
make
that
second
claim,
$130,000,
because
that
would
have
kicked
this
whole
picture
out
of
shape.
it
was
an
allocation."
and
judge
weinfeld
said
in
his
opinion,
“she
did
not
allocate
her
claim,
she
reduced
her
claim
as
against
each
vessel.”
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh
no.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
absolutely.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
for
this
reason,
she
had
in
--
she
had
sitting
in
ulster
county
a
lawsuit
which
is
still
lying
dormant
there
only
because
this
petitioner
got
a
restraining
order
preventing
her
from
trying
that
case
before
them.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
he
got
the
restraining
order.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
true,
i
--
i
go
along
with
that.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
it
sounds
--
it
sounds
unusual,
your
honor,
but
you
--
what
you
see
and
how
--
what
brought
that
about?
if
you
see
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
when
the
petitioner
says
there
were
two
funds
and
i
may
have
liability
as
a
tug
owner
and
i
may
have
liability
as
a
barge
owner
and
her
suit
is
pending
in
ulster
county
against
the
petitioner
charging
frauds
on
the
petitioner
for
frauds
and
--
of
the
person,
owner
tug
and
of
the
barge,
the
one
against
the
barge
being
only
with
respect
to
inadequate
light.
then,
they,
having
made
that
contention
naturally,
judge
weinfeld
said,
“all
right,
if
she
can
bring
her
claims
within
the
amount
of
each
bond
and
the
bond
is
taking
the
place
of
the
vessel
in
a
limitation
proceeding,
she
then
may
--
may
proceed
with
a
state
court
suit
and
by
a
special
verdict
have
it
found
whether
or
not,
there
is
negligence
on
the
petitioner's
tug
owner,
its
personnel
or
which
personnel
on
--
on
board
of
the
barge
and
what
her
damages
are."
now,
it
seems
unusual
that
she
is
making
a
two
separate
claims
against
the
petitioner
for
the
one
claim,
the
death
of
her
husband
too.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
true.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
i
suppose
that
it
might
--
i
might
be
criticized
for
the
numbers
i
have
picked,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
frank
c.
mason
i
see
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
all
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that
with
you.
let's
assume
that
it
was
lake
tankers,
as
owner
of
the
tug
eastern
cities,
an
x
corporation
which
owned
the
barge.
and
each
one
filed
a
separate
proceeding
and
each
one
put
a
bond
on
it,
you
see.
and
i
decided
to
file
a
claim
in
this
proceeding
for
$100,000
and
i
decide
for
purposes
of
my
own
to
file
one
in
this
proceeding
for
$150,000.
now,
i
have
only
one
claim,
i
only
lost
one
husband,
so
to
speak,
you
see.
but
still,
i
can
file
a
claim
in
each
proceeding
as
i
go
along
and
i
may
or
may
not
be
right
in
not
making
them
same
--
now
with
the
same
amount.
now,
what
the
circuit
court
said
here
was;
that
since
they
were
willing
to
treat
in
the
district
court,
this
case
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
--
as
if
there
were
two
separate
funds,
they
having
propounded
this
theory
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
your
honor,
you
say
why
--
we
aren't
required
to
do
that.
they
--
in
these
cases,
it
has
been
permitted
for
claimants
to
reduce
their
claims,
you
see.
and
in
the
trinidad
case,
which
was
handed
down
just
two
days
before
judge
weinfeld
decided
this
case
lifting
the
restraining
order,
in
the
trinidad
case,
they
laid
down
a
rule
which
should
be
followed
with
respect
to
these
claimants
who
had
reduced
their
claims.
they
had
to
unconditionally
but
partially
release
by
a
formal
document,
the
petitioner
for
the
difference
between
the
claim
as
originally
made
and
the
reduced
amount.
they
had
to
stipulate
as
we
have
had
to
do
here
that
she
may
proceed
in
the
state
court
suit
only
to
judgment
that
she
may
not
collect
her
judgment
elsewhere
than
in
this
proceeding
that
she
waives
any
right
or
claim
of
res
judicata
with
respect
to
questions
of
limitation
in
the
state
court.
that
this
court,
the
district
court,
retains
jurisdiction
of
the
proceedings
for
all
purposes
against
the
event
that
the
question
of
limitation
should
be
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
state
court
suit
or
the
action
takes
some
other
form
which
would
be
repugnant
to
the
federal
question.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
i
--
i
think
in
the
state
courts,
you
could
do
that,
you
could
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
i
would
file
my
claim
in
each
proceeding
in
no
doubt,
the
southern
district
admiralty
court
having
the
two
proceedings
would
control
my
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well
i
--
i
would
assume,
your
honor,
that
the
district
court
would
--
in
--
in
the
handling
of
the
fund
say
that
if
this
fall
around
the
part
of
both
vessels
and
if
there
were
two
proceedings
that
those
--
they
should
divide
it
evenly
because
even
under
your
principles
of
admiralty
law
with
respect
to
collision,
where
you
have
both
to
blame,
the
damages
are
divided.
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing,
i
think.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
the
--
the
question
that
we
could
not
raise
in
the
state
court
is
seaworthiness
or
the
privity
or
knowledge
of
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
both
of
which
are
parental
questions
relating
strictly
to
limitation,
you
see.
we
could
never
raise
any
question
on
that
score.
and
in
langnes
against
green,
where
this
--
this
court
having
given
him
permission
to
go
on
with
the
state
court
suit,
he,
having
them
proceeded
in
the
state
court
suit
and
having
raised
the
question
of
limitation,
seaworthiness,
that
having
come
to
the
court's
attention,
the
district
court's
attention
in
washington,
it
then
issued
the
restraining
order
and
gave
him
a
time
limit
of
about
three
days
to
stipulate
that
he
was
not
going
to
raise
that
question
again,
then
he
sought
mandamus
in
this
court
to
compel
the
district
court
to
comply
with
this
court's
first
decision
and
this
court
said
no,
that
he
must
leave
limitation
completely
out
of
the
state
court
suit.
what
they
did
assume,
though,
was
that
in
the
state
court
suit,
it
could
be
found
--
there
could
be
found
the
question
of
negligence
of
the
defendant,
petitioner.
and
they,
also
in
that
case,
this
court
said,
it
could
be
found
what
was
the
value
of
the
tug,
what
was
the
value
of
the
tug
which
is
even
further
that
we're
asked
--
asking
this
court
or
the
courts
below
to
go.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
just
one.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no.no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
bond
is,
as
this
court
has
said
so
often
and
now
this
i
have
said;
the
bond
only
is
a
substitute
for
the
vessel.
and
so,
if
the
vessel
were
given
in,
it
would
be
sold
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
true.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
this,
your
honors,
in
conclusion.
the
--
as
i
see
this
case,
very
frankly,
this
respondent
has
made
no
effort
throughout
this
litigation
to
take
any
right
from
this
petitioner.
his
right
thing
--
the
right
to
limit.
she
has
made
no
effort
to
take
his
right
to
limit
from
him.
on
the
other
hand,
in
order
to
safeguard
that
right,
there
have
been
very
formal
stipulations,
partial
releases,
provisions
in
the
order
and
this
additional
provision
which
the
circuit
court
has
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
suggested,
all
designed
not
to
benefit
this
claimant
or
respondent
but
to
safeguard
this
very
sacred
right
of
limitation.
now,
then,
i
say
to
the
court
in
all
frankness
that
while
all
that
is
going
on,
the
petitioner,
under
the
guise
of
claiming
that
concursus
is
such
an
important
thing
here,
is
in
truth
endeavoring
to
take
from
her,
her
sacred
right
to
a
common
law
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
form
of
her
choice.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
but
i
think
there
is
the
distinction
that
i
think
the
court
should
recognize
for
this
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
this
--
this
woman
is
not
saying,
“i
want
something
which
the
lord
does
not
give
me.”
she
is
willing
at
every
step
of
the
way
under
these
stipulations
and
releases
to
say,
“i
do
not
question
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
or
the
--
the
court's
right
to
adjudicate
the
fund
or
this
question
of
limitation
and
strictly
in
the
admiralty
court.
all
i
want
is
the
jury
trial
for
which
i
started
the
suit
way
back
in
1954
and
i
am
willing
to
assign
anything
if
i
can
get
my
jury
trial.”
but
the
petitioner
keeps
saying,
“not
enough."
not
enough.
and
he's
had
every
safeguard
that's
entitled
to
it
to
preserve
its
right
of
limitation.
and,
therefore
i
say,
that
as
in
langnes
against
green,
this
court
said
that
once
the
district
court
having
weighed
the
equities
in
all
fairness
and
justice,
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
grant
this
woman
her
jury
trial
insofar
as
the
granting
of
that
right
may
not
harm
this
petitioner
in
its
right
of
limitation.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
your
honor,
i
am
--
i
think
then
under
the
circuit
court's
provision,
i
can
only
get
the
$9000.
i
can't
get
any
--
i
can
only
get
the
$9000
but
i
--
i
see
what
your
honor
is
driving
at
that
belief.
you've
heard
the
--
judge
hinck's
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
and
i
--
and
treating
with
that
in
the
circuit
court
when
the
hearing
on
fund
was
had
in
the
brief
pointed
at
this,
we
have
in
new
york,
as
your
honor
knows,
those
sections
relating
to
special
verdicts
which
means
that
in
a
proper
case,
an
application
can
be
made
for
the
jury
to
make
special
findings
on
questions
which
you
put
to
it.
and
that
practice
has
been
followed
constantly
in
new
york
because
the
appellate
court
should
recognize
the
value
of
special
verdicts.
in
langnes
against
green,
this
court
recognized
that
there
are
certain
questions
which
could
be
propounded
in
the
state
court
and
found
in
the
state
court.
judge
hincks
felt
that,
as
he
put
it,
it
is
not
altogether
unlikely,
he
says,
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
state
court
would
refuse
to
propound
questions
of
the
jury
under
a
special
verdict.
i
don't
think
that's
altogether
the
basis
for
denying
this
woman
her
right.
i
don't
think
it
should
be
assumed
that
the
state
court
will
refuse
to
do
what
they
have
sections
in
their
cpa
just
for
that
purpose.
in
other
words,
that
i
think
the
state
court
judge,
and
in
line
with
the
--
the
appellate
division
decisions
and
court
of
appeals
decisions
would
be
much
more
inclined
to
have
a
special
verdict
brought
in
than
a
general
verdict.
i
don't
see
any
present
reason
why
the
state
court
judge
would
decline
to
have
the
jury
thing
under
special
verdict.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
we
can't
enforce
it
in
a
state
court,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh,
i
think
we
couldn't
bring
it
into
the
limitation
proceeding,
i
think
we
could.
i
--
i
think
my
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
the
appointment
obtains
a
judgment
in
her
state
court
sued
for
an
amount
in
excess
of
$100,000.
an
injunction
will
issue
permanently
enjoining
her
from
collecting
any
such
excess
unless
the
judgment
versed
on
it's
special
verdict
allocating
the
amount
as
between
the
libellant
as
owner
of
the
tug
and
as
owner
of
the
barge.
but
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
judge
hincks
has
unduly
exercised
about
this
question
whether
a
state
court
trial
judge
would
decline
to
have
a
jury
being
in
a
special
verdict.
that
is
looking
for
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
now,
even
this
morning,
in
the
library
here,
i
went
looking
to
and
find
cases
and
you'll
find
it
in
new
york
county
specially
where
there
are
land
vehicles,
automobiles,
and
trucks
involved
where
there
were
these
special
verdicts
brought
in,
not
that
the
jury
knows
it
but
because
of
the
difference
in
the
insurance
coverage
on
the
vehicles.
and
one
case
i've
read
here
this
morning
was
a
case
upstate
new
york
where
a
man
was
killed
by
a
collision
between
a
car
and
a
truck.
the
jury
listened
to
the
story
of
each
of
the
drivers
and
if
what
they
said
was
so;
there
was
no
collision,
apparently,
although,
a
man
was
killed.
each
one
had
a
--
diametrically
opposed
version.
in
that
case,
the
trial
judge
permitted
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
general
verdict.
and
that
case
was
reversed
and
sent
back
and
the
judge
was
criticized
for
not
having
used
a
special
verdict
provision
of
the
act
because
both
versions
being
so
directly
opposed
to
each
other.
it
pointed
that
a
special
verdict
would
have
given
the
answer
to
the
question;
who
really
was
at
fault?
in
that
case,
both
defendants
were
held
by
the
jury.
well,
i
think
on
the
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
the
language,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
there
is
only
one
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
there
--
there
is
only
one
--
that
language
only
helps
me
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
and
the
latter
too.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that
--
that
here
we
must
recognize
two
rights
of
opposing
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
what
you
want
a
--
an
answer
to
--
the
slightest
problem,
the
proposition
that
mr.
underwood
suggests
or
proposes
that
concursus
does
not
depend
upon
an
inadequate
fund.
i
can't
see
how
this
court
could
ever
ever
extend
the
intent
of
the
limitation
act
this
day
and
age
to
include
a
situation
where
there
being
an
adequate
fund,
the
ceiling
being
high
enough
that
without
regard
to
that,
a
shipowner
is
entitled
to
file
a
petition
in
limitation
and
compel
all
these
common
law
suitors
to
come
into
admiralty
and
have
their
suits
tried
there.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
well,
i
think
that
was
my
friend's
principal
point
rather.
i
--
i
would
like
to
leave
this
one
the
last,
though,
if
the
court
please.
on
the
question
whether
or
not
concursus
in
those
two
sections
having
to
do
with
concursus
are
so
important
or
that
whether
they
have
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
old
case
of
white
against
island
transportation
company
at
233
u.s.346,
that
was
a
single
claim.
it
was
one
where
the
woman
contended
that
you
couldn't
have
limitation
unless
there
was
more
than
one
claim.
and
she
based
that
on
the
theory
that
these
two
sections
which
were
then
--
then
known
as
4284
and
4025,
we've
--
we've
referred
to
a
plurality
of
claims,
and
therefore,
we
had
a
single
thing
it
couldn't
have
limitation.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
in
that
case,
this
court
said,
that
the
dominant
statute
in
limitation
is
4283
which
says
that
a
man
may
limit
his
liability
to
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
vessel
and
said,
the
succeeding
sections
are
in
the
nature
of
an
appendix
and
relate
to
proceedings
by
which
the
first
is
to
be
made
effective.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
at
233
u.s.,
white
against
island
transportation
corp.
233
u.s.,
346,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
they,
in
the
present
state
of
the
case
i
think,
your
honor,
by
--
by
the
lifting
of
the
restraining
order
they
wouldn't
have
to
pay
anymore
out
because
just
$9500
and
so
forth
claims
left
in
the
limitation
proceeding
to
be
adjudicated
there
but
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
your
honor.
the
--
i
don't
see
how
the
claims
could
exceed
the
fund
if
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
oh,
well
if
your
honor
is
going
back
to
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
adding
up
the
number
in
the
lawsuits
against
the
amount
of
the
barge.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
yes.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
i
say
if
you
were
to
add
up,
your
honor,
the
amounts
of
these
--
amounts
stated
in
the
lawsuits,
you
see?
mr.
frank
c.
mason
in
the
lawsuits
but
we
are
beyond
that
point
for
the
reason
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
my
point
there
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
no,
i
figured,
you
see
--
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
mason
that's
right.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
