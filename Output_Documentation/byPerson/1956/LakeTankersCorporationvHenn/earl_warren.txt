suppose
the
value
--
suppose
the
value
of
the
ship
was
intimately
more
than
the
aggregate
of
the
claims,
do
you
--
would
you
--
you'll
still
believe
that
the
limitation
of
liability
proceedings
should
require
all
claims
to
be
brought
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
a
moment?
you
say
that
the
question
of
liability
is
--
is
just
as
important
as
the
--
as
the
amount
of
the
fund,
as
i
understood
you
to
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
anything
to
--
in
the
statute
or
in
the
cases
to
indicate
that
--
that
that
is
important
without
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
--
was
there
anything
in
the
statutes
here
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
get
to
what
your
arguing
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
to
say
in
that
particular
case,
which
was
the
larger,
the
fund
or
the
claims?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
any
--
any
case
in
this
court
where
the
--
the
fund
was
larger
than
the
aggregate
of
the
claims
with
the
results
that
you
have
just
given?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
insofar
as
this
court
is
concerned,
this
is
a
matter
of
first
impression.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
underwood,
would
--
what
is
the
standard
of
--
of
good
faith
as
you
--
as
you
used
it?
what
else
go
--
go
to
make
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
oh
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
underwood,
i
--
i'm
having
some
difficulty
with
your
--
with
your
argument.
as
i
understood
you,
you
answered
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you;
under
the
statute
in
our
decisions,
can
go
in
to
the
district
court
and
frankly
say
the
value
of
our
ship
greatly
exceeds
the
amount
of
the
claims
and
that
you
are
entitled
to
--
to
be
in
court
on
this
proceeding
because
this
court
has
recognized
the
--
your
right
to
have
your
liability
determined
in
--
in
one
action.
now,
that
being
true,
you
say
that
the
--
you
also
said,
in
answer
to
my
question,
that
there
must
not
be
a
lack
of
good
faith.
now
what
would
constitute
a
lack
of
good
faith
in
--
in
those
circumstance
--
in
--
in
filing
a
suit
of
that
kind
if
you
have
that
right
as
i
have
just
outlined
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
i
understand,
there's
no
one
of
those
cases
that
you
can
point
to
where
the
--
the
fund
exceeded
the
claims?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
hardly
consistent
with
your
theory
though
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
fund
exceeds
the
claims
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
underwood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mason.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mason,
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
does
this
finding
of
--
or
--
or
part
of
the
order
of
judge
weinfeld
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
in
this
case
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
as
it
appears
on
page
62
at
the
top
there.
it
said
we
think,
however,
judge
weinfeld's
order
should
be
amended
to
include
the
following,
if
claimant
obtains
a
judgment
in
her
state
court
suit
for
an
amount
in
excess
of
$100,000,
an
injunction
will
issue
permanently
enjoining
her
from
collecting
such
excess
unless
the
judgment
rest
on
a
special
verdict
allocating
the
amount
as
between
the
libellant
as
owner
of
the
tug
and
as
owner
of
the
barge,
respectively.
thus,
if
the
judgment
exceeds
$100,000
and
the
jury
finds
libellant
liable
solely
as
the
owner
of
the
tug,
she
will
be
enjoined
from
collecting
any
excess.
if
the
jury
finds
that
the
libellant
is
liable
solely
as
owner
of
the
barge,
she
would
be
enjoined
from
collecting
any
amount
in
excess
of
$150,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
position
that
that
--
that
that
does
state
the
limits
of
your
recovery
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
separates
your
recovery
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
that
you
can
be
ascertainable
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by

court
even?
