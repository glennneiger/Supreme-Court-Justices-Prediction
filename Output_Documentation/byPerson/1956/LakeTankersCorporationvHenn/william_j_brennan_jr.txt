mr.
underwood
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
chief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
just
wondered,
would
you
say
that
the
aquitania
was
rightfully
decided
independently
of
the
factor
of
when
that
petition
was
filed,
the
timing
in
other
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
disparity
between
the
$9,300,000
would
not
be
a
reason
for
that
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
had
to
add
the
fact
that
the
petition
was
not
filed
until
the
cases
in
the
state
courts
were
about
to
come
to
file.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mason,
one
thing
that
puzzles
me,
how
--
i
gather
the
respondents
claim
is
for
damages,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
death
of
her
husband?
now,
i
suppose
that
claim
is
worth
x
dollars,
whatever
the
x
dollars
may
ultimately
prove
to
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
she
is
worth
--
entitled
to
her
recovery
only
in
the
x
dollars,
that's
the
value
of
the
claims,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
divide
that
claim
into
x
minus
y
as
against
one
vessel
and
make
it
y
as
against
the
other
vessel,
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
know
what
brought
that
about,
i've
heard
you
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
interested
how,
as
a
matter
of
law,
do
you
divide
the
claim
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
actually,
she's
putting
one
price
tag
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
her
death
--
on
the
amount
of
her
damages
as
against
one
vessel
and
another
price
tag
on
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
as
i've
always
i
understood
it,
she
has
a
single
claim
for
damages
worth
of
x
dollars.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
can
you
--
i'm
not
neglecting
any
occurrences
at
all.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
what
dominances
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
proper
answer
to
that
but
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
understand
if
this
is
a
matter
of
law
or
how
you
divide
up
a
single
claim
worth
x
dollars
in
that
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
for
example
they
were
not
the
same
owner
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
these
were
two
different
vessels,
isn't
that
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
two
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
see
what's
bothering
me
goes
deeper
than
that,
i
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there's
a
single
claim
upon
which
you
put
a
price
of
$250,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
that
isn't
what
you're
required
to
assert
in
both
proceedings
even
if
they
were
separate
proceedings
is
what
i
have
difficulty
following.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
actually
in
the
state
court
suit
you
have
a
recovery
of
$100,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
instance,
i
suppose
there's
no
problem
whether
you
collect
it
out
of
the
barge
or
out
of
the
tug,
the
$100,000
is
out
of
the
same
owner
in
any
event.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
you
had,
at
least,
two
different
owners
and
you
have
collected
the
$100,000.00
and
you've
done
just
what
you've
done
here.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
collect
the
$100,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
take
it
all
out
of
one
and
all
out
of
the
tug,
for
example,
and
forget
the
barge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
under
the
circumstances
you
have
described
for
us
that
you
can't
do
anything
except
collect
now
either
the
tug
or
on
the
barge,
isn't
that
what
you've
said
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
divide
up
the
damages
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
among
--
between
--
