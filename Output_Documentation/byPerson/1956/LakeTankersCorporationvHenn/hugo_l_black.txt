there
is
no
--
no
change
in
the
common
ownership
of
the
barge
and
the
tug
at
any
point
along
the
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
in
effect,
is
it
not,
that
your
argument,
that
by
the
passing
of
this
statute,
it
was
intended
to
accomplish
that
which
it
accomplished
in
state
courts
to
escape
trial
by
jury
through
equitable
injunction
to
prevent
a
multiplicity
of
suits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
know
the
case
has
decided
the
aquitania
case
in
which
the
second
circuit
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
held
the
same
--
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
over
what
period
of
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
mason.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
outside
of
the
possibility
that
the
jury
might
give
a
legal
verdict
and
the
judge
would
give
an
adequate,
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
--
these
shipowners
here
would
have
to
pay
out
anymore
under
the
orders
of
the
court
here
now
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
are
two
boats
instead
of
one
upon
anything
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
--
is
there
any
--
any
reason
why
they
would
have
to
pay
out
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
if
then
they
would,
if
there
were
only
one
claimant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
orders
of
the
court,
has
there
now
any
existence
as
to
how
this
would
be
held
under
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals?
the
question
i
have
in
mind
is
the
shipowner
here,
the
owner
of
the
two
boats,
the
tug
with
the
tug
and
barge,
is
there
any
possibility
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay
out
more
than
the
amount
fixed
as
to
them
--
as
an
entity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
bound
to
be
and
either
of
the
event
less
than
the
value
of
the
barge
and
the
tub?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
orders
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
did
you
say
they
were
doing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
amount
stated
in
the
lawsuits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
the
same
now,
are
you
not,
as
though
you
had
sued
the
court
in
diversity
of
jurisdiction
for
$2999.99?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
get
anymore
than
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
--
they
have
barred
you
now,
haven't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
find
anything
in
the
limitation
of
statute
that
indicate
that
an
owner
of
two
boats
in
an
accident
is
anymore
than
decided
to
get
rid
of
the
jury
trial
then
the
owner
of
one
boat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he
comes
to
any
more
damages
because
it's
a
--
there
are
two
boats
involved
in
it
and
because
they
want
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
depends
on
how
the
court
construes
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
limitation
--
what
is
the
amount
of
the
claim
that
the
admiralty
court
as
it
barred
them
to
accept
as
enough
against
the
--
for
the
debts
of
these
people,
what
is
the
amount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean
is
this
and
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
have
reduced
the
amount
or
that
they
originally
claim
from
something
to
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
$259,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
--
is
it
possible
for
them
to
get
any
more
than
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
--
if
they
try
the
case
before
jury
or
if
they
try
the
case
before
admiralty
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
that
is
the
amount
of
damages
that
the
--
these
people
have
suffered,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
they're
entitled
to
recover
that
money
if
it
should
be
found
that
that's
the
amount
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
owned
--
who
owned
both
vessels?
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
company
and
will
that
company
--
does
that
company
stand
a
little
to
a
dime
more
unless
the
jury
gives
more
by
having
the
case
tried
at
the
state
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
than
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
lose
any
more
than
$259,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
point
does
the
court
order
provided
but
what
does
the
courts
order
provided
up
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
provide
the
admiralty
courts
cant
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
there
any
chance
that
she
could
get
any
--
that
you
could
get
out
any
less
than
that
in
the
admiralty
court
unless
the
admiralty
judges
happen
to
give
a
less
verdict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
not
talking
about
the
facts,
i'm
talking
about
aside
from
the
desire
to
escape
the
jury
verdict.
let's
get
away
from
that
just
a
moment
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
law,
you
say
$100,000
is
the
maximum
that
they
can
--
they
can
--
admiralty
court
will
give
in
some
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
couldn't
give
anymore
under
the
order
here
that
they
have
fixed
for
these
people
to
recover.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
its
order
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
orders
a
sustain
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
has
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
it
had
to
be
limited
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
the
$100,000
is
all
they
could
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
the
admiralty
court
would
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
held
that
both
were
liable,
would
they
allocate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
can't
cant
get
quite
--
are
you
claiming
that
under
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
possible
under
any
circumstances
for
these
petitioners
to
get
a
dollar
more
--
a
dollar
more,
or
at
least
as
much
as
the
fund
which
has
been
found
to
be
any
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
court
held
that
there
was
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
judge
just
as
you
said
if
the
admiralty
held,
what
could
be
the
result
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
hurt
the
company
that
she's
been
compelled
to
reduce
it,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it
shouldn't
be
a
dilemma
to
the
petitioner,
should
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
that
is?
