mr.
eugene
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
is
an
admiralty
proceeding
for
exoneration
from
or
limitation
of
liability
in
a
collision
case
in
which
the
petitioner
in
this
court
was
the
petitioner
for
exoneration
from
or
limitation
of
liability
in
the
district
court.
in
brief,
the
facts
are
these.
the
petitioner
owned
a
tug
and
a
barge
which
were
proceeding
up
the
hudson
river
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
a
small
pleasure
craft
on
which
there
were
11
people
proceeding
in
the
opposite
direction,
south
in
the
hudson
river,
collided
with
the
barge,
capsized,
sank
and
was
a
total
loss.
and
the
10
of
the
passengers
on
that
little
boat
survived,
but
one
lost
his
life,
the
respondent's
husband
lost
his
life.
i
should
say
to
you
that
the
tug
and
the
barge
were
made
up
in
push-tow
fashion.
that
is
to
say,
there
is
in
the
stern
of
the
barge
of
the
--
in
which
the
tug
puts
its
bow
and
the
barge
is
securely
lashed
to
the
tug
so
that
the
tug
has
utter
and
complete
control
over
the
barge
in
every
respect.
following
this
collision
and
the
loss
of
the
little
boat
called
blackstone,
five
actions
at
law
were
begun
in
the
state
court.
one
to
recover
for
the
death
of
the
respondent's
husband,
and
another,
to
recover
for
personal
injuries
and
the
loss
of
the
blackstone.
and
in
these
two
suits,
on
behalf
of
five
people,
including
the
respondent,
the
claims
aggregated
$657,500.
mr.
eugene
underwood
there
were
two
actions
in
the
state
court.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
other
one
was
on
behalf
of
four
of
the
passengers
who
combined
in
one
action.
and
they
claimed
personal
injuries
as
well
as
the
loss
of
the
blackstone.
there
was
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
also
the
blackstone.
that's
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
if
your
honor
please,
the
--
the
action
in
the
state
court
was
in
personam
against
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
eugene
underwood
they
claimed
for
the
loss
of
the
blackstone
which
was
the
little
yacht.
the
tug
was
the
eastern
cities.
mr.
eugene
underwood
the
barge
was
number
38
and
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
but
the
owner
of
the
blackstone
was
a
plaintiff
in
one
of
these
actions
to
recover
for
his
personal
injuries
and
for
the
loss
of
his
vessel.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
there
have
been
six
other
persons
who
had
then
spilled
into
the
water
and
were
rescued
still
to
be
heard
from.
this
petitioner
filed
its
petition
for
limitation
of
--
or
in
the
first
instance
exoneration
from
liability
because
the
claims
vastly
exceeded
the
values
involved.
as
i
have
said
to
you,
the
claims
are
for
the
five
amounted
to
more
than
$650,000,
and
yet
the
value
of
the
tug
was
$110,000,
the
barge
$165,000,
and
the
freight
money,
$8500.
the
aggregate
of
the
petitioners
interest
therefore
in
his
--
its
vessels
were
$283,500.
accordingly,
we
filed
the
petition.
it's
appearing
that
there
would
be
need
to
distribute
a
limited
fund
if
liability
should
be
decreed.
a
bond
was
given
only
for
the
tug
at
that
time
for
this
reason.
it
is
well
settled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
where
a
barge
is
solely
in
control
of
a
tug,
she
is
not
liable
and
her
value
does
not
have
to
be
included
in
the
limitation
fund
unless
she'd
be
guilty
of
some
individual
fault
in
rem
of
her
own,
and
there
was
at
that
time
no
claim
that
she
was.
this
respondent
accepted
to
our
petition
on
the
ground
that
we
had
not
given
adequate
security
and
claimed
on
that
occasion
that
the
barge
was
in
--
at
fault
in
rem
because
of
not
showing
of
proper
lights.
the
judge
sustained
those
exceptions
but
gave
us
leave
to
file
an
additional
bond
for
the
barge
which
we
promptly
did
and
there's
no
dispute
about
the
amount
and
there
has
been
almost
from
the
beginning
a
bond
posted
in
the
district
court
for
the
full
amount
of
the
value
of
the
two
vessels
plus
the
freight
money.
in
that
proceeding,
in
that
limitation
of
liability
proceeding,
this
respondent
filed
her
answer
in
denying
our
claim
to
limit
liability
if
liable,
and
of
course,
denying
that
we
are
entitled
to
exoneration.
in
that
proceeding,
however,
she
filed
claim
in
a
substantially
reduced
amount,
namely,
for
$250,000
instead
of
$500,000.
in
that
proceeding
also,
the
10
other
passengers
filed
claims,
but
in
an
aggregate
of
only
$9500,
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
with
the
figures
but
they
do
become
important,
the
arithmetic
is
of
importance
here.
so
that
these
claims
which
--
when
the
petition
was
filed,
aggregate
of
$657,500
with
six
more
to
be
heard
from
were
--
when
all
the
claims
were
filed
in
the
limitation
proceeding
itself,
only
$259,500.
at
that
stage,
this
respondent
again
made
a
motion
in
the
district
court,
this
time
to
vacate
the
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
claims
could
not
possibly
equal
the
fund
that
an
inadequate
fund
was
necessary
to
sustain
the
proceeding,
and
therefore,
she
wanted
to
have
the
restraining
order
vacated
as
to
her
and
allow
her
to
proceed
in
the
district
court.
this
came
on
before
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
i'm
sorry,
in
the
state
court.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
misstated,
i
misspoken
myself,
in
the
state
court.
that
motion
came
on
before
judge
weinfeld
and
he
denied
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
it
could
not
yet
be
said
that
the
fund
would
necessarily
be
adequate.
for
this
reason,
the
fund
will
be
made
up,
assuming
that
there
is
liability
at
all,
the
fund
will
be
made
up
of
the
value
of
the
tug
if
the
tug
is
at
fault,
of
the
barge
if
the
barge
is
at
fault
but
not
of
either
that
is
not
personally
at
fault
in
rem.
so,
my
argument
was,
and
judge
weinfeld
agreed
with
my
argument
at
that
time,
that
you
can't
say
that
this
fund
is
bound
to
be
enough
until
you
decide
which
of
these
vessels
was
liable
in
rem.
and
you
can't
do
that
until
after
trial,
and
therefore,
you
should
not
vacate
the
restraining
order
and
allow
this
action
at
law
in
the
state
court
to
go
along
by
itself.
the
judge
agreed
with
all
of
that
and
denied
the
motion
but
he
added
a
little
caveat
at
the
end
of
his
opinion
and
he
said;
however,
if
this
respondent,
claimant
as
she
was
called
in
that
court,
will
reduce
her
claims
so
that
the
amount
of
the
claims
against
each
vessel
is
less
than
that
vessel's
value,
then
she
may
proceed
in
the
state
court.
well,
with
that
advice
from
the
judge,
the
necessary
stipulations
and
so
on
were
filed
in
the
district
court
and
a
new
motion
was
made
to
vacate
the
restraining
order
as
to
this
respondent
and
that
motion
was
granted.
the
theory
then
being
that
there
were
two
funds,
two
sort
of
separate
proceedings,
which
the
court
of
appeal
later
said
very
explicitly,
one
for
the
tug
and
one
for
the
barge.
this
respondent
had
allocated
her
$250,000
claim,
a
$100,000
to
the
tug,
and
a
$150,000
to
the
barge.
so
that
when
you
add
the
$9000
i
had
claimed
for
all
the
other
10,
the
aggregate
of
the
claims
against
the
tug
is
less
than
her
value
and
the
aggregate
of
the
claims
against
the
barge
is
less
than
the
barge's
value.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
ownership
remains
the
same.
this
petitioner
owns
both.
we
appealed
from
--
from
that
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
by
divided
court.
judge
frank
and
judge
clark
were
the
majority
and
judge
hincks
wrote
the
minority
opinion.
the
affirmance
was
on
two
grounds.
one,
that
concourse
may
only
be
had
in
these
cases
when
the
fund
is
definitely
not
adequate.
you've
got
--
you've
got
to
have
an
inadequate
fund
as
a
prerequisite
to
sustaining
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
and
the
court
went
along
with
judge
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
i
do,
sir.
i
do.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
do.
and
the
court
also
held
that
there
are
here,
indeed,
they
said
this
proceeding
must
be
treated
as
if
it
were
two
separate
proceedings.
it
is
not,
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
must
be
treated
as
if
these
were
two
separate
proceedings,
one
for
the
tug
and
one
for
the
barge
and
the
fund
in
each
is
adequate
on
the
basis
of
the
arithmetic
that
i
have
told
you
about.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
if
your
honor
please.
i
claim
that
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
and
the
rules
of
this
court,
and
the
old
decisions
of
this
court,
as
i
believe,
taken
in
to
the
reenactment
of
the
statute
in
1936,
make
it
perfectly
plain
that
one
of
the
two
basic
reasons
for
the
limitation
of
liability
proceeding
is
to
bring
all
claims
in
such
a
case
into
concourse
so
that
the
merits
may
be
disposed
of,
the
liabilities
may
be
disposed
of
in
one
proceeding
affecting
all
the
parties
at
the
same
time,
not
only
to
distribute
an
inadequate
fund,
it
isn't
a
kind
of
a
bankruptcy,
it's
more
than
that.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
it
were
--
that
phrase
has
been
used
in
some
of
the
old
decisions.
mr.
eugene
underwood
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
it
gets
back
to
a
matter
of
good
faith,
if
i
may
answer
your
question
that
way.
i'll
--
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
your
question
right
now.
the
--
the
origin
of
this
so-called
rule
in
the
second
circuit,
as
i
have
referred
to
it
in
my
brief,
is
just
such
a
case,
it
was
the
aquitania.
the
aquitania
sank
a
small
fishing
vessel.
upwards
of
two
years
went
by
when
the
lawsuits
brought
in
the
state
court
by
the
next
of
kin
of
the
people
who
lost
their
lives
in
that
fishing
boat
were
pending
and
were
coming
on
for
trial.
then,
as
they
were
about
to
be
reached
for
trial,
all
in
one
bunch,
the
owners
of
the
cunard
line,
the
owners
of
the
aquitania;
filed
a
petition
for
limitation
of
liability
and
represented
in
their
petition
that
the
value
of
the
aquitania
was
$9
million.
and
the
claims,
as
was
later
demonstrated,
because
judge
augustus
hand
do
have
the
case,
sent
it
to
a
commissioner
to
find
out
how
much
the
claims
were,
could
not
exceed
about
$300,000.
so
the
--
the
petition
was
attacked
of
its
foundation
on
the
ground
that
it
had
not
been
brought
in
good
faith.
and
that
was
the
reason
that
that
petition
was
treated
the
way
it
was,
the
restraining
order
was
vacated.
and
i
--
i'll
come
to
this
a
little
later
on
in
the
regular
course
of
my
argument,
if
i
may,
but
answering
your
honors
question,
the
rule
for
which
i
would
contend
in
the
last
analysis
in
this
court
is
simply
this.
that
if
at
the
time
the
petition
is
filed,
the
vessel
owner,
in
good
faith,
fears
--
reasonably
fears,
if
you
like,
that
the
claims
will
exceed
the
fund,
he
is
entitled
to
file
his
petition
and
the
court
cannot
be
--
and
jurisdiction
properly
attaches
at
that
stage
under
those
conditions
and
that
the
court
does
not
lose
its
jurisdiction
because
it
later
appears
that
the
petitioner
was
unduly
pessimistic.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
don't
think
it
can
be
sustained
solely
on
that
ground.
i
--
i
want
to
add
this
other
feature
to
it.
mr.
eugene
underwood
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
my
argument
is
based
upon
what
i
concede
to
be
the
law
as
developed
by
the
cases
over
this
period
of
75
years
or
more.
and
i
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
well
i
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
was
about
to
say
a
moment
ago,
i
think,
the
grounds
for
judge
hincks'
dissent.
he
dissented
from
the
majority
on
the
ground
that
there
is,
in
fact,
here,
only
one
proceeding.
there
is
only
one
petitioner
and
there
is
one
indivisible
claim
by
this
respondent,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
need,
and
indeed
it
is
altogether
improper
to
regard
it
as
if
it
were
two.
also,
he
based
his
dissent
on
the
ground
that
the
prosecution
of
the
respondent's
action
in
the
state
court
must
necessarily
be
fruitless,
and
the
reason
for
that
i
will
come
to
when
i
make
that
point
in
my
argument,
if
i
may.
we
filed
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
a
rehearing
in
the
bank.
they
granted
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
bank
but
after
that
rehearing
which
was
by
briefs,
not
oral
argument,
i
only
gained
one
judge
and
they
--
the
court
reaffirmed
its
position
to
forward
it
too
instead
of
the
original
three-to-one
whereupon,
they
applied
for
certiorari
and
here
we
are.
mr.
eugene
underwood
judge
medina.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
sir,
they
did
not.
so
i
have
really
three
points
here.
one,
that
under
these
circumstances,
at
least,
an
inadequate
fund
is
not
a
prerequisite,
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
maintaining
the
petition.
secondly,
even
if
it'd
be,
it
cannot
yet
be
said
that
the
fund
must
be
inadequate.
and
third,
that
the
state
court
action
must
be
fruitless
in
any
event
hence,
it
should
not
be
--
we
should
not
be
required
to
proceed
in
the
state
court.
now
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
statute
which
is
printed
completely
beginning
at
page
39
of
the
--
the
petitioner's
brief
in
an
appendix.
and
what
we
concede
to
be
of
more
important
passages
of
it
are
printed
beginning
at
page
2.
we
say
at
the
outset
that
--
and
it's
part
of
the
claim
that
the
statute
nowhere
says
that
an
inadequate
fund
is
necessary
to
maintaining
the
proceeding.
section
183
(a)
provides
that
where
the
owner
without
privity
or
knowledge
is
liable,
and
his
liability
shall
not
exceed
the
value
of
his
interest
in
the
vessel.
i
should
add
parenthetically
that
the
other
provisions
of
section
133,
after
subsection
(a),
relate
to
seagoing
vessels
and
a
so-called
statutory
fund
of
$60
per
ton
which
is
not
any
part
of
this
case
because
our
vessels
here
were
not
seagoing.
and
at
section
184
provides
that
where
the
fund
is
not
adequate,
either
the
owner
of
the
vessel
or
the
persons
who
have
suffered
loss,
may
institute
the
proceeding
and
section
185
provides
and
this
is
--
was
the
law
when
this
incident
occurred
that
the
vessel
owner,
within
six
months
after
a
claimant
shall
have
given
to
or
filed
with
such
owner
a
written
notice
of
the
claim
may
petition
at
district
court,
and
so
on.
and
the
last
sentence
of
that
provision
is
of
considerable
significance
as
it
seems
to
us.
it
provides,
upon
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
this
section,
all
claims
and
proceedings
against
the
owner
with
respect
to
the
matter
in
question
shall
cease.
now,
the
act
did
not
set
up
any
procedures.
this
act
was
originally
passed
in
1851.
it
set
up
no
procedures
for
invoking
its
benefits.
and
it
was
20
years
before
this
court
had
occasion
to
consider
the
making
of
rules,
and
i'll
come
in
a
moment
to
the
decision
that
caught
--
that
brought
that
about.
but
the
rules
are
now
rules
51,
52,
53,
54,
and
55.51
is
the
rule
of
this
court
which
requires
--
which
defines
what
the
petitioner
in
a
limitation
proceeding
must
say
in
his
petition,
and
it
does
that
with
considerable
particularity.
it's
at
page
44
of
the
petitioner's
brief
here.
it
shall
set
forth
the
facts
or
state
the
facts
showing
that
the
petition
is
filed
in
the
proper
district.
it
must
show
the
amount
of
all
demands
including
all
unsatisfied
liens
or
claims
of
liens
arising
on
the
voyage
in
question.
and
what
suits,
if
any,
are
pending
and
the
value
of
the
vessel,
the
closer
the
void
that
is
it
asks
this
pertinent
arithmetical
questions.
how
much
in
the
way
of
claims
are
you
faced
with?
and
on
the
other
hand,
what
value
have
you
got
in
your
vessel?
but
nowhere
does
the
rule
say
that
the
claims
must
exceed
the
value
of
the
vessel.
and
of
--
of
great
importance
to
our
view,
at
least,
is
rule
53
which
provides
that
in
these
proceedings,
the
petitioner
shall
be
at
liberty
to
contest
his
liability
as
we
do
in
this
case.
now,
going
back
to
rule
51,
it
provides
that
after
reciting
these
various
particulars
in
the
petition,
the
petitioner
may
give
an
interim
stipulation
and
then
the
last
part
of
rule
51
at
page
47
of
our
brief
provides
the
said
court
shall
also
on
the
application
of
the
petitioner
make
an
order
to
restrain
the
further
prosecution
of
all
and
any
suit
or
suits
against
the
petitioner
and
so
on.
that
is
having
filed
the
petition
in
keeping
with
the
court's
rules
about
what
the
petitioner
must
alleged.
in
having
given
the
bond,
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
restraining
order
until
this
proceeding
has
been
carried
through
with
conclusion.
that's
what
we
think
that
means.
and
the
word
is
"shall
restrain."
now
we
think
that
the
cases
--
cases
show
--
cases
decided
by
this
court
show
that
concursus
on
the
question
of
liability
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
intention
lying
behind
this
proceeding
which
in
a
large
way
is
the
creature
of
this
court,
is
the
creature
of
the
rules
of
this
court
as
the
division
of
an
inadequate
fund.
the
first
case
that
came
to
this
court
was
in
1871,
20
years
after
the
statute
was
passed.
it
was
norwich
company
against
wright.
and
there,
after
an
--
after
an
interlocutory
decree
had
been
entered
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
a
question
of
determining
liability
in
one
proceeding
amongst
all
the
claimants
on
the
one
hand
and
the
petitioner
on
the
other.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
not
in
this
--
not
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
think
--
i
think
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
--
i
think
the
proceeding
has
to
be
dealt
with
as
a
combination
of
the
statute
of
1851
and
this
court's
rules
of
1871
and
this
court's
uniform
decisions
from
1871
down
up
to
1936
and
the
reenactment
of
this
statute
in
1936
with
the
gloss
of
this
court's
decisions
upon
the
statute
and
without
any
change
particularly
in
the
light
of
what
the
congress
was
told
at
that
time
about
the
perks
of
the
whole
proceeding.
and
i'll
--
bear
with
me
till
i
get
to
it,
i'll
be
there
shortly,
i
think.
in
this
norwich
company
against
wright,
that
was
a
collision
case
and
the
liability
had
been
determined
as
was
the
practice
for
a
great
many
years
in
a
separate
proceeding.
limitation
for
many,
many
years
was
not
sought
until
liability
had
been
determined
in
some
separate
proceeding.
there,
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
--
pointed
out
that
the
act
didn't
say
in
what
court
the
benefits
of
the
statute
should
be
invoked.
the
court
said
that
no
court
was
better
adopted
to
do
that
than
the
admiralty
that
the
state
courts
do
not
have
the
requisite
jurisdiction
and
that
this
court
undoubtedly
had
the
power
to
make
all
the
need
for
rules
and
regulations
for
facilitating
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
this
court
said
that
the
shipowner
need
not
admit
liability
but
may
institute
proceedings
to
determine
the
liability
as
with
being
hit
on
the
one
hand
and
all
the
payments
at
one
time
on
the
other
hand.
and
having
filed
its
petition
or
giving
--
given
security
for
the
fund,
the
shipowner
will
be
entitled
to
an
order
restraining
the
prosecution
of
all
other
suits.
and
that
if
an
action
should
be
brought
in
a
state
court,
the
shipowner
can
follow
the
same
procedure
and
restrain
the
further
prosecution
of
that
suit.
that
was
in
1871.
the
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
bradley.
i
mentioned
that
because
he
wrote
at
least
two
or
three
letters
delineating
the
purpose
of
the
court
in
the
making
of
these
rules.
the
making
of
the
rules
was
referred
to
in
--
in
that
opinion
and
the
rules
were
handed
down
at
the
same
term
of
the
court.
so
that,
i
think
that
norwich
company
case
has
a
great
deal
of
meaning
in
the
interpretation
of
the
rules
himself
showing
their
purpose,
the
purpose
of
this
court
in
making
these
rules.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
sir.
he
did,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
and
the
next
case,
i
think,
was
the
benefactor
also
written
by
mr.
justice
bradley
in
1880
where
he
said,
concerning
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
the
56th
rule
and
it
was
then
the
56th
rule
has
become
now
the
53rd
rule.
it
was
merely
intended
to
relieve
the
shipowners
from
the
english
rule
of
practice
which
requires
them
when
they
seek
the
benefit
of
the
law
of
limited
liability
to
confess
the
ship
to
have
been
enfold
in
the
collision,
to
require
the
owners
of
either
vessel
to
confess
fault
before
allowing
them
to
--
to
claim
the
benefit
of
the
law
would
go
far
to
deprive
them
of
this
benefit
altogether.
hence,
this
court
in
preparing
the
rules
of
procedure
for
our
limitation
of
liability,
deemed
it
proper
to
allow
a
party
seeking
such
limitation
to
contest
any
liability,
whatever.
so
that
the
purpose
of
this
court
in
setting
up
this
form
of
procedure
to
allow
the
vessel
owner
to
contest
his
liability
in
one
proceeding
with
all
the
claimants
against
him,
however
few,
or
however
many
is
perfectly
clear.
again,
in
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
significant
cases
in
the
books
on
this
subject,
providence
against
--
and
new
york
steamship
company
against
hill,
decided
in
1883
by
this
court,
was
really
a
contest
between
the
state
courts
in
massachusetts
and
the
federal
courts
to
see
who
was
really
going
to
win
out
and
decide
these
cases
for
all
the
time
to
come.
mr.
justice
bradley
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
there,
a
ship
had
burned
alongside
a
dock
in
new
york
and
consumed
some
cargo
owned
by
the
hill
company
which
was
a
massachusetts
concern,
they
sued
the
shipowner
in
massachusetts.
the
shipowner
filed
his
limitation
proceeding.
he
sought
exoneration
under
the
fire
statute
and
limitation
of
liability
if
he
should
be
held
in
the
federal
court
in
new
york.
the
massachusetts
court
was
told
about
dependency
of
the
limits
--
limited
liability
proceeding
and
the
restraining
order
had
issued
and
the
restraining
order
was
properly
served
and
all
that,
but
the
massachusetts
court
went
right
ahead
and
carried
that
case
through
the
conclusion
and
entered
judgment
against
the
steamship
company.
then
on
appeal
that
came
to
this
court,
and
this
court
said
--
mr.
justice
bradley
said,
before
the
court,
many
significant
things.
one
of
the
most
significant
to
our
way
of
thinking
is
that
the
statue
must
not
be
administered
with
a
type
of
grudging
hand.
it
must
be
--
and
this
court
has
said
this
in
a
dozen
cases
and
which
we
referred
to
in
our
brief,
the
statute
must
be
construed
liberally
to
accomplish
the
intention
behind
it,
the
statute
and
the
rules.
the
limit
--
the
limitation
of
liability
theory
was
only
sketched
and
outlined
by
the
act,
and
the
regulation
of
details
as
to
the
form
and
modes
of
proceeding
was
left
to
be
described
by
judicial
authority.
then
the
court
reviewed
the
rules
and
mentioned
again
the
purpose
to
allow
the
shipowner
to
contest
his
liability
in
one
proceeding
against
all
the
claimants
at
one
time.
they
referred
to
the
basis,
the
power
of
this
court
had
to
make
rules
as
to
process
actions
and
so
on.
and
said
again
that
the
rules
were
the
deliberate
judgment
of
this
court
as
to
the
proper
mode
of
procedure.
and
the
--
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say
for
the
purposes
of
having
their
rights
under
the
act
declared
and
settled
by
the
definitive
decree
of
a
competent
court
which
should
be
binding
on
all
parties
interested
and
protect
the
shipowners
from
being
harassed
by
litigation
in
other
tribunals.
i
won't
read
anymore
extracts.
there
are
many
if
--
if
--
when
the
court
comes
to
read
these
--
all
decisions
of
this
court,
i
am
sure
you
would
see
that
this
--
this
thread
of
purpose
to
bring
all
these
people
into
concourse,
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
an
inadequate
fund,
but
also
for
the
purpose
of
determining
in
one
proceeding
what
the
liability
shall
be
is
a
very
real
and
basic
purpose
behind
the
promulgation
of
these
rules
in
the
first
place
it
has
been
ever
since.
mr.
eugene
underwood
at
the
best
of
my
recollection,
the
--
if
your
honors
please,
i
don't
recall.
i
don't
recall
your
arithmetic.
i
don't
want
to
guess.
i
don't
remember.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
eugene
underwood
there
is
no
such
case.
mr.
eugene
underwood
well,
on
precisely
these
facts,
yes.
but
i'll
--
there
are
four
possible
situations
and
i'll
--
if
i
may
come
to
that
very
shortly
now
and
try
to
show
how
the
same
thing
has
been
arrived
at
in
different
situations,
very
much
the
same
as
this,
then
going
on
down
through
the
years
in
--
in
the
hartford
accident
case
in
273
u.s.
mr.
justice
taft
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
and
there
again,
he
delineated
the
--
he
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
proceedings
adopted
by
the
rules
was
to
bring
all
the
parties
into
concourse
to
determine
liabilities
as
well
as
to
distribute
an
inadequate
fund.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
spencer
kellogg
against
hicks
where
the
opinion
of
this
court
was
written
by
mr.
justice
roberts.
now,
in
1936,
two
years
after
the
morro
castle
burned,
the
congress
had
this
question
before
it
again
and
considered
the
whole
thing
and
only
made
one
substantial
change
in
the
statute.
for
seagoing
ships,
it
required
the
shipowner
where
the
fund
was
not
large
enough
itself
to
make
up
an
amount
equal
to
$60
per
ton
of
the
ship
--
of
the
ship's
tonnage.
that
doesn't
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
situation
because
these
vessels
were
not
seagoing
vessels
and
that
$60
ton
fund
was
limited
to
seagoing
vessels.
it
also
made
another
significant
change,
namely,
it
required
the
petitioner
to
institute
his
proceeding
within
six
months
at
the
time
he
receives
his
first
written
notice
of
claim.
that
has
not
been
the
law
before.
prior
to
that
time,
the
petitioner,
the
vessel
owner
could
start
its
petition
that
anytime,
that
even
after
he
had
tried
the
case
on
the
merits
and
--
and
lost
it
in
appeal
two
or
three
times.
now,
when
congress
was
considering
that
the
whole
thing,
as
it
did
at
great
length
at
that
time,
it
had
some
of
the
most
eminent
members
of
the
admiralty
bar
and
had
that
testimony
on
hearings,
and
as
this
court
referred
in
the
maryland
casualty
against
cushing
case,
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
was
then
explained
very
clearly
to
congress.
the
purpose
was
to
get
a
consensus
or
concursus
in
one
proceeding
to
determine
the
liabilities
as
well
as
to
distribute
the
fund.
and
our
position
is,
that
having
been
told
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
and
with
the
gloss
of
all
this
court's
many
statements
as
to
that
purpose,
when
congress
reenacted
the
statute
in
1936
and
made
only
those
changes
which
do
not
affect
this
aspect
of
the
case
at
all,
that
was,
we
think,
a
certainly
--
a
blessing
on
this
court's
prior
decisions
which
have
said
so
many
times
that
the
purpose
of
the
thing
is
to
bring
everybody
in
to
concourse
on
the
merits
and
not
merely
to
distribute
an
inadequate
fund.
mr.
eugene
underwood
under
--
under
the
circumstances
of
the
aquitania,
i
think
i
would
say,
as
the
court
did
in
that
case,
that
that
petition
is
not
filed
in
good
faith.
while
they
waited
for
--
waited
for
upwards
of
two
years
and
they
had
all
the
people
in
one
lawsuit
anyway
in
the
state
court
and
the
funds
was
$9
million
in
the
claims
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
it
was
believed
that
the
fund
was
not
adequate
to
it.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
--
i
think
so,
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way.
when
i
was
answering
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question,
i
was
trying
to
answer
it
having
in
mind
the
scope
of
all
the
decisions
on
this
point
as
they
affect
this
case,
and
one
of
those
is
the
aquitania
to
which
i
refer.
if
i
may
say
so,
looking
alone
at
this
court's
rules
and
this
court's
opinion,
such
a
refinement
is
not
permissible
or
necessary.
under
the
statute
and
this
court's
rules
and
this
court's
decisions,
our
position
is,
that
it
would
be
quite
proper
to
file
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding
and
frankly
say
we
know
the
claims
don't
exceed
with
the
fund
but
we
want
to
get
on
(voice
overlap)
--
we
want
to
get
them
all
at
one
time.
but
in
answering
the
chief
justice's
question,
i've
tried
to
tell
you
what
i
know
about
the
law,
generally,
and
the
aquitania
is
the
basis
for
the
so-called
rule
in
the
second
circuit
which
exists
nowhere
else,
by
the
way.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
there
has
expressly
said
that
it
is
enough
if
the
claim
seem
to
exceed
the
fund
in
good
faith
when
the
petitioners
filed.
mr.
eugene
underwood
about
1926
or
1927
and
thereabouts,
1926
or
1927.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
think
not.
except
--
perhaps
in
maryland
casualty
against
cushing,
that
was
discussed
--
yes
--
yes
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
wrong.
that
--
this
question
has
been
considered
in
the
hartford
accident
against
southern
pacific
and
in
spencer
kellogg
against
hicks
since
the
aquitania,
i
believe,
if
i
have
my
dates
right.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
eugene
underwood
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
be
content
to
accept
the
--
the
rule
as
this
court
has
laid
in
down
in
the
diversity
cases
which
is
one
of
my
points
here.
it
--
it's
perfectly
clear
under
the
diversity
cases
that
there
is
jurisdiction
if
the
amount
claimed
exceeds
$3000
in
good
faith.
that
is
if
--
if
the
plaintiff
really
feels
that
he
has
a
claim,
that
he
should
assert
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
$3000,
that's
enough.
now,
of
course,
that
looking
out
it
in
the
plaintiffs
point
of
view
under
the
diversity
case,
the
defendant
in
the
diversity
case
is
entitled
to
assume,
unless,
of
course,
there's
been
a
collusion
which
is
not
suggested
here
at
all,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
assume
that
the
plaintiff
has
made
an
appraisal
in
good
faith
of
his
case,
and
if
he
sues
for
$3100,
there's
the
jurisdiction.
the
same
--
the
rule
in
the
state
court
--
the
rule
in
the
diversity
cases
too
is
that,
if
he
sues
for
more
than
$3000
in
the
state
court
and
the
defendant
removes,
the
plaintiff
cannot
deprive
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction
by
reducing
the
amount
of
his
claim.
now,
that
is
what
these
claimants
have
in
effect
down
here.
they
made
claims
for
large
amounts.
these
claimants
were
not
passengers
on
our
boat
or
members
of
our
crew,
we
knew
nothing
of
them.our
boats
picked
them
up
and
put
them
in
ambulances
and
they
went
to
the
hospital
and
that's
all
we
knew
about
the
amounts
of
their
claims.
then
they
sue
in
the
state
court
for
amounts
aggregating
more
than
twice
the
value
of
our
interests
--
in
--
in
our
two
vessels.
we
couldn't
possibly
know
that
there
was
anything
padded
about
those
claims.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
your
honor.
oh
yes,
it
followed
the
--
the
making
--
the
bringing
of
actual
actions
at
law
against
us
in
the
state
court.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
would
not.
in
view
of
the
--
of
the
rule
of
this
court
and
the
purpose
of
the
rule
as
stated
by
this
court's
decisions
over
the
years
which
i've
adverted
to
at
too
much
length,
i'm
afraid,
i
would
say
that
the
aquitania
was
wrongly
decided
which
is
simply
another
way
of
saying
that
i
think
concourse
alone
were
enough
to
sustain
the
proceeding.
mr.
eugene
underwood
only
as
to
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
underwood
when
i
answered
your
honors
question,
i
was
trying
to
--
to
bundle
up
in
--
in
one
bundle,
not
only
the
decisions
of
this
court
but
the
decisions
of
the
second
circuit,
particularly
the
aquitania
and
--
and
tell
you
what
the
law
was
in
this
case
as
we
got
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeal
in
--
in
new
york.
when
i
answered
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
i
was
trying
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
the
law
was
as
--
as
delineative
by
the
statute,
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
don't
think,
in
good
faith,
has
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
at
all.
if
i
am
right
in
saying
that
the
statute,
the
rules
and
the
decisions
of
this
--
of
this
court
permit
us
to
sustain
the
limitation
proceeding
regardless
of
the
amount
of
the
fund,
whether
it
exceeds
the
claims
or
not.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
make
myself
clear
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
oh,
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh
perhaps
six
--
each
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
a
period
of
about
twenty
years.
mr.
eugene
underwood
thirty
years,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
the
aquitania?
mr.
eugene
underwood
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
a
case
i
was
in,
the
petition
of
trinidad
and
its
in
my
brief
and
it's
very
recent.
there,
and
this
will
give
you
a
background
of
what
goes
on
in
these
cases.
i'm
--
i'm
taking
more
than
time
with
my
--
i'm
allowed
i'm
afraid.
in
the
petition
of
trinidad,
we
filed
a
petition
for
limitation
of
liability
and
the
claims
clearly
exceeded
the
fund.
as
is
usual
in
these
cases,
we
settle
many
of
the
claims.
our
settlements
whittle
down
always
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
claims,
and
one,
we've
been,
perhaps,
foolish
enough
to
settle
enough
of
the
claims
so
that
the
remaining
claims
no
longer
exceeded
the
fund,
then,
these
claimants
went
in,
reduced
the
amounts
as
they
had
stated
their
claims
to
a
figure
just
below
the
fund
and
then
asked
the
court
to
let
them
out
from
under
the
restraining
order.
the
court
did
so,
the
district
court
did
so.
i
appealed
attempting
to
raise
that
question
which
is
now
here
before
this
court
in
this
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
true,
the
claims
have
been
reduced
to
an
amount
less
than
the
fund
but
it
is
so
little
less
than
the
fund
that
we
will
not
sustain
the
district
court
in
vacating
the
restraining
order.
so,
there
--
there
is
a
case.
i
had
forgotten
it
when
i
was
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago,
but
there
is
a
case
where
the
fund
in
the
second
circuit
was
admittedly
enough
to
go
around
and
pay
everybody
in
full
as
against
his
reduced
claims,
and
still,
they
would
not
relax
the
restraining
order
and
made
them
all
stay
in
the
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
eugene
underwood
the
petition
of
trinidad
corporation.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
think
they
went
on
the
--
they
went
on
the
theory
that
they
were
following
the
rule
in
the
aquitania,
but
the
reduction
had
been
--
the
claims
had
been
brought
beneath
the
fund
by
such
a
small
amount
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
ensure
them
that
the
claim
was
really
enough
to
go
around
and
that
the
fund
was
really
enough
to
go
around.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no
,
it
does
not.
the
--
the
great
background
of
facts
and
--
and
one
further
reason
that
i
--
that
i
should
like
to
mention
here
for
the
position
that
i
take
is
these
six
months
provision
that
was
put
into
the
statute
by
the
1936
amendments.
that
does
not
--
nowhere
in
the
statute
does
it
say
that
the
claims
have
to
exceed
the
fund,
yet,
the
petitioner
is
bound
to
file
this
petition.
if
he's
going
to
file
one
ever
within
six
months
of
the
first
notice
of
claim,
now
it
may
well
be
that
by
the
time
six
months
have
come
and
are
about
to
expire,
the
claims
will
not
exceed
the
fund.
it
may
well
be
that
these
claimants
will
hold
back.
indeed,
i
could
give
you
cases
that
aren't
in
the
books,
but
i
know
that
that's
been
done
as
a
strategy.
if
petitioner
must
allege
that
the
claims
exceeded
the
fund,
he
can
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
limitation
of
liability
entirely
by
the
claimants
getting
together
and
just
not
filing
more
than
one
claim
until
after
the
six
months
have
gone
by
and
just
giving
him
notice
of
one.
that's
a
very
--
very
real
and
substantial
risk.
if
--
if
the
court
please,
both
of
my
lights
have
--
have
flashed
and
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
--
a
reply.
mr.
eugene
underwood
may
i
address
myself
first
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
i'd
like
to
answer
that,
i'm
afraid
a
little
differently
than
mr.
mason
did.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
there's
a
very
real
danger
and
a
very
real
difference.
let's
look
at
what
may
happen
in
the
state
court.
under
the
relaxation
of
the
restraining
order,
this
respondent
can
sue
in
the
state
court
and
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
state
court
will
adopt
the
special
verdict
suggestion.
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
because
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
liability
in
the
state
court
but
let's
suppose
it
does.
the
court
of
appeals
and
judge
weinfeld
visualized
a
determination
by
the
state
court
that
either
the
tug
or
the
barge
or
both
was
at
fault.
well,
let's
suppose
that
the
state
court;
the
jury
finds
that
they're
both
at
fault
then
they
get
a
judgment
for
whatever
the
jury
fixes
up
to
$250,000
and
they
bring
that
back
to
the
limitation
proceeding,
as
they
must
do
under
the
restraining
order
and
under
the
stipulation
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
respondent
sign.
but
that
decision,
as
to
the
liability
of
this
petitioner
as
tug
owner
or
barge
owner,
cannot
be
binding
on
the
admiralty
court
because
the
limitation
fund
is
measured
by
the
in
rem
liability
of
tug
or
barge
and
it
is
conceded
by
this
respondent
in
--
in
her
brief
that
only
the
admiralty
court
can
decide
that.
and
that
is
a
necessary
concession
because
this
court
has
so
held.
therefore,
it
can
very
well
cost
us
more
in
either
one
of
two
ways
if
we
have
to
go
to
the
state
court
and
try
the
case.
again,
if
the
state
court
holds
us
liable
because
of
some
fault
of
tug
and
barge,
they
--
either
they
can
recover
on
that
in
which
case,
it
would
cost
us
more
than
if
the
admiralty
court
holds
only
one
vessel
or
it's
entirely
fruitless,
meaningless,
null,
and
void
in
every
sense
because
only
the
admiralty
court
can
decide
which
of
these
vessels
is
at
fault.
that
is
so
inherent,
so
basic,
so
interwoven
in
the
whole
concept
of
limitation
of
liability
that
my
friend
concedes
and
this
court
has
held,
other
courts
have
held
that
that
must
be
determined
and
can
only
be
determined
by
the
admiralty
court.
so,
she
tries
a
case
in
the
state
court
and
gets
a
judgment
based
upon
the
fault
of
both,
she
has
to
bring
it
back
to
the
admiralty
court
and
it's
no
good
in
the
admiralty
court
because
only
the
admiralty
court
can
decide
whether
tug
is
at
fault
and
whether
barge
is
at
fault.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
your
honors
question.
mr.
eugene
underwood
the
aggregate
of
claims
of
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
$259,000.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no.
mr.
eugene
underwood
not
now.
mr.
eugene
underwood
if
it
--
if
it
should
be
found
that
the
tug
and
barge
are
both
liable.
mr.
eugene
underwood
but
if
your
honor
please,
you
see
the
value
of
each
vessel
is
less
than
that
so
let
us
suppose
that
only
the
tug
is
liable
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
same
company,
this
petitioner.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
but
it
can
lose
more
than
the
value
of
the
tug
if
the
federal
court
should
hold
that
only
the
tug
is
liable,
it
could
lose
more
than
the
value
of
the
tug
if
the
jury
brings
in
a
verdict
of
$250,000
and
the
federal
court
holds
that
only
the
tug
is
liable,
then
we're
entitled
to
limit
our
liability
to
$110,000.
but
if
you
enforce
the
state
court
judgment
for
$250,000,
it
cost
us
what
is
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
eugene
underwood
the
courts
order
provides
that
if
the
recovery
is
for
more
--
in
the
state
court
is
for
more
than
$100,000,
you
got
to
take
it
back
to
the
admiralty
court
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
you've
got
to
take
it
back
to
the
admiralty
court
anyway.
mr.
eugene
underwood
it
provides
that
--
it
can't
the
--
this
respondent
cannot
recover
more
than
--
i'm
--
i'm
glad
to
see,
your
honor,
i'd
much
rather
have
you
refer
to
the
record
than
trust
my
memory
at
this
state.
i
think
she
cannot
get
more
than
$100,000.00
unless
it's
based
upon
a
special
verdict
which
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
the
admiralty
court
might
very
well
hold
near
these
vessels
at
fault.
we
haven't
told
you
what
the
facts
are
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh
no.
oh
no,
no.
there's
no
limit
to
what
the
admiralty
court
will
give
if
it's
persuaded
of
the
damages
and
if
it
holds
that
there's
no
limitation.
i
say
to
you
this,
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
they
could
give
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
they
could
limit
--
the
admiralty
court
could
limit
our
liability
to
$110,000.
mr.
eugene
underwood
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
decided
any
question
of
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
eugene
underwood
in
the
--
in
the
stipulation
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
these
people,
this
respondent
be
required
to
make,
it
says
in
effect,
as
i
recall
it,
that
she
cannot
recover
more
than
$100,000
unless
state
court
verdict
is
a
special
verdict
and
allocates
the
amount
between
tug
and
barge.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
don't
know
what
the
admiralty
court
would
do
because
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh,
if
they
held
that
both
were
liable,
there'd
be
no
need
for
an
allocation
because
then
the
fund
would
exceed
the
claims.
it's
unimportant
to
allocate
if
both
are
liable
but
you
can't
tell
until
after
trial.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i'm
claiming,
if
i
may
answer
your
question
this
way,
either
one
or
two
things,
either
it
is
possible
or
the
whole
state
court
proceeding
must
be
entirely
nugatory,
because
if
the
state
court
verdict
is
for
more
than
$110,000,
that
being
the
value
of
the
tug,
either
she
can
recover
the
excess
or
not
but
if
the
federal
court
in
admiralty
says
that
the
barge
is
not
liable
and
limits
our
liability
to
the
tug,
her
--
the
limit
of
her
recovery
would
be
her
share
of
$110,000.
mr.
eugene
underwood
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that
illustrates,
i
think,
one
of
vices
of
trying
to
unscramble
these
eggs.
the
court
has
made
her
waive
all
claim
of
res
judicata
with
respect
to
anything
that
relates
to
the
limitation
of
liability,
but
we
are
not
under
any
such
impediment.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
if
the
jury
should
bring
in
a
verdict,
and
i
can't
visualize
this,
but
if
a
jury
should
bring
in
credit
for
the
defendant,
that
would
be
res
judicata.
well
i
--
i
think
the
light
was
shining,
i've
had
several
other
things
to
say.
mr.
eugene
underwood
thank
you.
mr.
eugene
underwood
thank
you,
sir.
i
would
like
to
mention
now
one
thing.
this
is
--
this
is
definitely
a
--
a
single
proceeding.
the
petition
beginning
on
--
on
page
4
of
the
record
in
this
case,
if
i
may
read
a
little
bit
of
it
to
you,
petitioner
claims
exemption
from
liability
for
the
losses,
damages,
injuries
and
destruction
occasioned
or
encouraged
by
or
resulting
from
the
aforesaid
collision
and
losses
and
for
the
claims
for
damages
that
have
been
or
may
here
be
made
and
the
petitioner
alleges
that
it
has
valid
defense
as
thereto
on
the
facts
and
the
law.
that
is
we
filed
this
petition
as
one
single
solitary
proceeding
on
behalf
of
one
vessel
owner
who
happened
to
own
two
vessels.
we
pleaded
the
common
ownership
of
both,
we
pleaded
that
both
were
seaworthy,
we
pleaded
that
we
weren't
liable
for
either,
we
pleaded
that
if
we
were,
we
were
entitled
to
limitation
of
liability,
and
we
gave
bond
only
for
the
one
because
under
this
court's
decisions,
only
the
one
that's
the
controlling
factor
and
that
fault
in
rem
is
liable
and
we
saw
no
possible
way
by
which
this
barge
could
be
held
at
fault.
and
at
that
time,
and
i
cannot
say
this
too
earnestly,
there
was
no
claim
by
this
respondent
that
the
barge
was
guilty
of
any
fault
of
her
own.
i
made
that
point,
i
think,
the
first
point
in
my
reply
brief.
even
so,
we
anticipated
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
such
a
claim
and
in
our
petition,
we
--
we
offered
not
only
an
interim
stipulation
for
the
value
of
the
tug
but
we've
also
offered
an
interim
stipulation
for
such
additional
interest
as
may
be
appropriate
whenever
the
same
shall
be
ordered
by
the
court.therefore,
by
those
words,
i
drew
those
words.
we
intended
to
offer
a
stipulation
for
the
barge
if
at
some
future
time,
it
should
become
necessary
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
so
that
this
was
one
solitary
proceeding
and
was
intended
to
such
in
the
beginning.
now,
there
were
not
ever
two
funds
and
it
has
never
been
my
position
that
there
are
two
funds
in
this
case.
it
may
be
that
i
used
a
little
inadvertent
language
in
a
brief
that
i
wrote
in
--
in
the
district
court,
there
were
two
funds
only
in
the
sense
that
there
were
two
different
stipulations
but
my
argument
to
judge
weinfeld
was
that
there
was
not
yet
any
fund
as
indeed
is
still
true,
there
is
not
yet
any
fund,
we
don't
know
what
the
fund
is
going
to
be.
at
the
moment,
there
is
only
security,
two
separate
pieces
of
paper,
it's
true.
but
the
security
is
for
the
value
of
the
two.
you
can't
tell
what
fund
will
--
what
the
fund
will
be
until
there
has
been
a
trial
under
merits
and
that
can
only
be
in
the
admiralty
because
only
the
admiralty
can
determine
which
of
the
vessels
is
liable
in
rem,
state
courts
are
incompetent
to
do
that.
i
think
that
concludes
my
argument
except
for
one
thing.
i'd
like
to
express
my
final
review
on
this
question
of
concursus.
it
is
not
necessary
in
this
case
to
go
the
whole
way
and
say
that
concursus
alone
is
enough.
i
--
in
my
brief
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
workable
rule
in
this
cases
as
in
the
diversity
cases
to
test
the
good
faith
of
the
petitioner
when
he
files
his
petition,
if
at
that
time
the
claims
are
real
and
in
good
faith
he
apprehends
the
need
for
a
concursus
then
he
is
entitled
to
file
his
petition
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
should
not
thereafter
be
the
football
be
at
the
whim
of
these
claimants
in
reducing
their
claims.
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh
i
agree,
not.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
agree
not.
of
course
not.
thank
you
very
much.
