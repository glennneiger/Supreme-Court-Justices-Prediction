justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
second
general
--
what
was
the
second
proceeding
in
the
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
one
was
for
the
husband,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
said
also
the
blackstone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
they
brought
suit
against
the
barge
and
the
tug
as
well
as
the
blackstone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
down
slow.
it
was
a
suit
by
the
widow
and
then
the
suit
on
behalf
of
four
passengers
for
injury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
against
the
tug
--
against
the
owner
of
the
tug
and
also
the
blackstone
owner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
loss
--
for
the
loss
of
the
vessel
that
was
brought
in
the
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
what?
common
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
it
came
to
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
challenge
with
that,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
challenge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
affirmatively
what
it
is
you
do
contend
for
in
challenging
that
if
the
fund
exceeds
the
claims,
the
basis
for
limitations
doesn't
exist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
bill
in
equity
to
--
it's
a
bill
of
interpleader
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
regarding
it
merely
as
a
suit,
as
a
proceeding
to
avoid
multiplicity
of
suits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
--
well,
that
mean
--
that
alone
isn't
sufficient.
you're
introducing
a
--
adifferent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
general
principle
in
equity
if
the
court
is
ceased
of
jurisdiction
and
if
it
turns
out
that
--
there
couldn't
be
a
grant
of
injunction.
it
may
nevertheless
assess
damages
at
--
at
--
if
in
the
beginning
it
had
--
had
brought
the
jurisdiction
on
the
treaty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
your
--
all
right.
i
follow
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
write
anything,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
announced
that
it
would
be.
in
his
opinion,
he
said;
we
are
now
passing
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
underwood?
as
i
understood
you,
you
agreed
that
if
a
petition
for
limitation
were
filed
instead
the
fund
is
larger
than
the
claims
but
we
come
in
here
because
you
want
all
the
claims
to
be
litigated.
you
--
you
would
say
that
was
--
that
could
be
accepted
here
but
that
--
that's
not
and
that
would
be
thrown
out.
did
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
take
out
having
had
them
all
in
one
suit,
i
want
to
ask
you
questions
before
i
put
it
as
clearly
as
i
can.
if,
as
i
understood
you,
the
mere
desire
to
dispose
of
all
the
claims
in
a
fund,
plainly
adequate
for
all
the
claims,
in
order
to
avoid
duplicity
--
multiplicity
of
suit,
if
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
basis
for
limitation
proceedings,
what
is
there
in
our
rules
of
our
decisions
which
makes
the
additional
element
which
you
have
asserted
this
case
--
i
mean
what
you
have
in
this
case.
can
you
tell
me,
namely,
that
after
proceeding
--
when
the
proceeding
was
brought,
it
was
believed
that
the
fund
was
not
adequate,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
has
--
yes.
now,
what
is
then
and
still
is
for
the
overview
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
there
which
makes
that
added
element,
namely,
that
it
was
in
good
faith
and
believe
that
the
fund
was
not
adequate
though
the
way
judge
weinfeld's
suggestion
redistributed
the
claim
made
the
fund
adequate.
what
is
then
our
rule
that
does
permit?
do
i
made
myself
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
the
case
--
about
and
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
when
you
say
the
rule
of
thirteenth
circuit,
we
haven't
glanced
at
that
question
specifically,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
limitation
proceeding
followed
the
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thirty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
just
looked
at
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
in
1947,
mr.
underwood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
case
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
judge
hincks
indicated
and
as
you
have
said
you
would
come
to
it,
this
case
doesn't
present
--
present
that
issue
in
isolation,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
limitation
proceedings
just
for
the
--
the
matter
of
mechanic,
was
there
a
petition?one
petition
for
limiting
liability
on
the
barge
and
one
on
the
tug?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
apart
from
posting,
before
you
get
to
posting
security,
the
security
has
posted
for
something
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
was
there
a
request
for
the
limitation
of
these
both
against
barge
and
tug?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
--
as
you
stated
that
the
limitation
was
merely
for
the
--
for
the
--
for
--
what
was
it
called?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
tug,
eastern
cities.
supposed
they
delivered
the
tug
to
raise
itself
posted
and
they
could,
very
well,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
court
--
city
and
the
eastern,
tug
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
hold
it
and
--
and
people
get
out
of
it
whatever
they
got
out
it,
would
the
barge
also
had
to
be
delivered
in
that
limitation
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
there's
no
limitation
proceeding
against
the
barge
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
saw
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
i
do
not
see
how
restraining
state
action
ipso
facto
or
automatically
operate
as
a
limitation
proceeding
against
--
against
the
barge,
does
it?
the
fact
that
you
--
you
have
prevented
or
prohibited
and
joined
from
proceeding
with
your
state
suit
doesn't
mean
that
the
barge
is
in
the
--
is
in
the
custody
of
a
court,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
was
there
any
limitation
against
the
barge
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
wondering
what
would
have
happened
if
after
the
petition
of
lake
tankers
corporation
had
been
filed,
they
then
said
and
they
had
made
an
offer
and
we
--
we
had
brought
in
and
handed
over
to
the
--
whatever
you
call
it,
to
the
court,
it
would
be
the
clerk
or
any,
it
turned
over
to
the
clerk
,
the
barge
and
the
--
and
the
tug,
would
they,
under
that
petition?
they
didn't
seem
to
ask
for
any
limitations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i'm
interested
in
the
second
aspect
of
judge
hincks'
opinion
to
which
you
duly
come
that
this
isn't
two
proceedings
but
one
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
--
that's
the
whole
sticking
part
whether
by
reducing
the
claim
and
making
allocation,
you
make
these
two
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
there
had
been
no
funds,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
forget
about
the
funds
as
a
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
--
the
lake
tankers
corporation
had
surrendered
the
--
the
vessels
themselves
no
--
no
posting
of
bonds.
of
course,
they
--
they
had
--
the
would
have
to
surrender
two
vessels
if
there
were
two
vessels.
would
the
proceedings
then
have
continued
as
one
proceeding
against
each
of
these
two
types
of
vessels?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
do
it,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
nobody
wouldn't
know
what
the
amounts
were
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
judge
--
judge
augustus
hand
in
the
aquitania,
according
to
judge
addison
brown
points
out,
indicate
that
it's
so
different
if
you
got
a
single
claim
--
a
single
claimant,
who
wants
to
go
into
the
state
court
has
a
right
to
go,
is
enjoined
by
a
federal
court
to
make
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
there
is
a
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
what
the
consequence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
of
the
difference,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
many
suits
as
in
a
single
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
this
is
different
from
any
of
those
other
cases.
those
other
cases
may
have
presented
the
rule
of
the
second
circuit
as
you
--
members
of
the
admiralty
law
call
it,
presented
a
rule
of
the
second
circuit
in
its
--
in
its
purity
as
it
were
named
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
you
can
use
limitations
for
little
piece
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
case
is
a
different
one,
namely,
or
how
that
in
other
cases
in
which
this
situation
arise
only
they've
got
two
vessels?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
have
there
been
other
cases
of
two
vessels?
you
hope
to
gather
as
it
were
in
a
single
collision
or
a
single
maritime
event
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
then
allocations
sought
to
be
made
by
the
claimant
against
the
two
vessels
in
order
to
bring
about
an
inadequacy
of
the
fund?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
what
this
is,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
couldn't
have
picked
it
up
from
his
brief
because
i
haven't
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
blame
originality
though
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
thought
of
the
word
as
a
familiar
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
know
innuendo
was
carried
by
my
word
of
allocation
but
the
reality
of
the
situation
is
that
the
proctors
in
this
case
did
what
lawyers
are
entitled
to
do,
they
dealt
with
the
(inaudible)
the
minority
come
within
certain
jurisdiction.
those
are
the
requirements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
held
and
didn't
sit
down
and
say,
â€œi
got
an
--
i
now
realize
that
there
are
$150,000
against
the
tug
and
$100,000
against
the
barge
if
i
subverts
that
she
didn't
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
lawyers
that
--
could
her
lawyers
were
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
come
within
decisions
and
the
rules
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
are
here
and
you
are
here.
you
urged
she
wasn't
entitled
to
get
a
restraining
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
that's
the
question
of
law
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it's
entitled
to
it
then
she
must
be
restrained.
if
she
isn't
entitled
to
do
it,
then
she
won't
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
would
merely
have
--
they
would
merely
have
the
money
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
they
would
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question?
how
--
how
do
you
determine,
maybe
allocation,
how
would
you
allocate
the
--
the
viability
for
that
$100,000
as
between
the
two
different
owners?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
you
have
--
wouldn't
some
of
the
issues
of
liability
be
determined
in
the
state
court
or
under
your
common
lawsuit?
how
could
you
recover
except
on
some
determination
of
liability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
that
be
relitigated
in
the
limitation
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
what
would
be
res
judicata?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
are
two
vessels
in
langnes
against
green?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
would
--
i
think
i'll
ask
you
this
question
but
not
as
explicitly
that
i
shall
now.
do
you
think
it
would
make
--
would
have
made
any
difference
or
your
position
be
in
the
slightest
different
if
the
two
vessels
had
been
surrendered
rather
than
bonds
posted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
say
there
were
two
funds,
you
could
merely
state
the
external
facts
of
those,
there
were
two
vessels.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
got
two
funds,
then
you
might
have
two
funds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
put
in
different
banks
into
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
have
two
vessels
and
that's
merely
the
fact
that
there
were
two
vessels
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
too
many
sacred
rights
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
this
case
permit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mason,
you
seem
to
get
a
great
deal
of
comfort
out
of
langnes
against
green?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
just
reread
it
to
refresh
my
recollections,
of
course,
in
case,
one
would
--
knows
to
be
well.
why
do
you
get
so
much
comfort
out
of
that
case?
that
was
a
one
claim
case
in
which
there
was
some
lingering,
some
remote
speculative
nonexistent
fear
there
might
be
other
claimants,
why
does
that
--
what
does
that
--
how
does
that
help
me
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
get
nothing
out
of
the
language
except
insistence.
there's
only
one
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
language
help
me
any
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
speaks
of
the
language.
i
haven't
refreshed.
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
grant
you
all
that
but
that
doesn't
help
me
to
decide
which
right
to
prevail.
this
is
a
--
mr.
underwood,
i
have
to
get
her
idea
to
call
attention
to
comparable
problems
in
the
domain
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
we
talked
about
sacred
and
sacred
and
i
think
that
just
clouds
the
atmosphere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
are
jurisdictional
situation,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
conflict
you
gave
it
to
which
is
reasonably
within
the
purport
of
the
statute
and
claimant
keeps
stock
out
of
the
federal
courts
by
reducing
their
claims
and
if
diversity
jurisdiction
should
be
hiked
up
to
$10,000,
people
will
reduce
their
claims
now
to
$9000
and
that's
all
right,
and
why
do
they
do
that?
that's
what
this
is.
and
now,
here,
we
certainly,
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem
if
there
--
if
you
couldn't
go
in
to
the
state
courts
in
a
situation
like
this,
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem
at
all.
you
can
go.
all
i'm
saying
--
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right.
all
i'm
saying
is
i
get
nothing
out
of
langnes
against
green
that
help
me
with
the
slightest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest,
mr.
mason,
that
one
does
not
have
to
decide
that
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
in
your
brief.
would
you
mind
giving
me
the
citation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
he
does
not
--
you
were
asked
if
they
were
one
vessel
instead
of
two,
if
there
were
one
vessel
against
two,
the
problem
wouldn't
arise
because
then
the
claims
would
exceed
the
fund,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
way
before
you
distributed
them
or
whatever
word
you
choose
to
call
as
to
allocate
that
the
fund
was
--
that
wasn't
sufficient?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
if
there
were
claims
merely
asserted
against
with
single
vessel
in
this
case,
the
word
of
the
--
the
amount
of
the
claims
would
exceed
the
amount
of
every
worth
for
the
vessel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
way
