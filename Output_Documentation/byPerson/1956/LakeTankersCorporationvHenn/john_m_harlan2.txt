who
did
you
acquire
in
that
precedent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
go
ahead
general,
you're
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
ended
up
in
the
state
courts
with
a
general
verdict
for
$100,000,
what
happens?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
--
suppose
in
the
state
court
judge
took
the
position
that
as
he
saw
the
issues
in
this
case,
it's
an
in
personam
action.
you
can't
split
this
thing
up
that
way
and
since
the
federal
court
is
in
effect
said
under
your
stipulation
that
if
he
gets
a
judgment
of
that
kind,
you
get
a
judgment
of
that
kind
in
the
state
court.
it
can't
be
enforced,
where
does
that
leave
the
state
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
can't
enforce
it
anywhere.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
--
i
thought
that
judge
frank
had
added
a
paragraph
to
the
stipulation
and
said;
“if
you
go
to
general
verdict,
why
is
then
you
weren't
enforcing
it
against
either?”
