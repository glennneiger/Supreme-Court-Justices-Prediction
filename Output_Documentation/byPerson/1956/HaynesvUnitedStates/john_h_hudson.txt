mr.
john
h.
hudson
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
my
hope
in
presentation
the
case
for
the
petitioners
that
we
will
give
the
court
a
rest
from
some
of
these
abstruse
and
profound
principles.
this
case
comes
to
this
on
a
report
by
which
of
the
fact
that
a
man
by
the
name
of
gordon
p.
haynes
during
the
year
1949
was
an
employee
of
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
under
what
is
called
here
a
plan
case.
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i'm
really
not
able
to
carry
on
but
it's
a
proposition
where
one
has
to
so
i
do
the
best
i
can.
this
plan
is
incorporated
in
the
record.
it
has
a
schedule
of
payments
to
its
employees
fixed
on
the
length
of
service.
mr.
haynes
suffered
an
accident
prior
to
the
time
he
become
ill
with
what
is
known
as
causalgia
or
balloon
nerve.
during
this
1949,
he
did
not
perform
any
service
for
the
southern
bell
telephone
company.
he
was
home
sick
so
the
record
in
the
evidence
show.
did
not
so
much
as
go
to
the
office
because
of
his
disability.
when
the
time
came
for
passing
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
$2100
which
he
earned
that
year
or
which
came
to
him
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
home
sick,
was
taxable
as
income
--
gross
income
or
was
exempt
under
section
22,
the
fact
the
telephone
company
itself
was
not
certain
about
it
so
they
went
ahead
and
turned
$318.44
to
the
tax
commissioner.
then
the
case
of
epmeier
came
along
and
the
question
rolled
as
to
whether
or
not
this
entire
fund
was
what
is
called
under
this
exemption
or
under
the
law,
income
law
whether
or
not
it
was
income
or
whether
or
not
it
was
upon
receive
because
of
illness,
sickness
or
was
benefit
upon
received
from
this
plan
as
such
that
it
was
not
proceeds
from
capital
on
the
part
of
haynes,
that
it
was
not
earnings
on
the
part
of
haynes
and
therefore
the
entire
$2100
was
exempt
from
taxation.
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
at
this
time
whether
or
not
this
is
income,
gross
income
and
is
taxable
or
whether
or
not
it
is
fund
received
from
sickness
and
disability
benefits
and
therefore
is
exempt.
now
we
think
and
may
it
please
the
court,
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
exemption
not
so
much
of
the
tax
statute
as
funds
which
are
exempt
under
the
22
(b)
(5)
that
are
not
taxable.
our
contention
is
that
this
cannot
be
what
is
known
as
income
from
labor
because
under
the
plan
and
haynes
had
served
under
this
plan
more
than
the
25-year
period
and
was
entitled
to
what
is
known
under
the
plan
as
full
compensation
or
full
payment.
now,
the
government
takes
this
view
of
this
entire
proposition
that
the
payments
which
went
to
mr.
haynes
while
he
was
sick
and
totally
disabled
was
simply
a
continuation
of
salary
plan
and
that
it
was
taxable.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
the
amount
of
the
salary,
the
total
he
earned
in
1949,
may
it
please
the
court
was
$2100.
now
that,
may
it
please
your
honor
was
the
sum
which
he
would
have
received
if
he
had
been
on
the
job
the
full
52
weeks
of
1949.
that
is
one
point
which
the
government
contends
that
this
is
income
and
it
is
taxable.
it
is
not
sick
and
disability
benefits
which
are
exempt
under
the
statute
involved.
we
think
among
some
other
contention
that
it
must
the
intent
and
purpose
of
this
plan,
it
really
in
substance
is
insurance,
although
it
is
not
marked
or
labeled
insurance
and
the
government
points
out
that
that
is
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
our
contention
then
it
is
not
issued
by
a
commercial
insurance
company.
no
objection
that
the
government
has
to
our
contention
is
that
this
plan
and
this
--
what
we
call
for
petitioners,
sick
benefit
do
not
require
and
the
company
does
not
require
that
its
employees
pay
a
cash
premium
for
this
protection.
now
we
don't
think
that
that
really
makes
any
difference.
the
services
which
he
rendered
to
the
telephone
company
as
an
employee
for
more
than
25
years,
we
think
is
ample
payment
of
what
we
may
term
premium.
now
there
are
several
--
there
are
several
other
marks
of
similarities
and
marks
of
dissimilarity
in
--
on
both
sides
of
this
question.
if
i
could
bring
myself
to
conceive
of
a
person
who
does
not
qualify
either
under
receiving
something
from
capitals
such
as
interest
or
grants
on
an
investment
or
not
receiving
something
for
the
labor
that
he
performed.
if
i
could
bring
myself
to
the
conclusion
that
nevertheless
that
sort
of
income
is
taxable
then
i
wouldn't
be
here
before
this
honorable
court
but
i
just
cannot
conceive
of
that.
we
get
income
from
two
sources
mainly.
one
of
them
is
from
capital
investing.
the
other
one
is
from
our
labor.
haynes
had
neither.
this
came
to
him
straight
because
he
was
protected
or
because
he
came
under
this
plan
and
because
he
was
sick
and
could
not
perform
any
service.
now
on
capital
--
look
at
this
pamphlet
which
is
the
heart
of
our
record,
you
will
find
that
there
are
graduated
scales.
one
reason
or
one
point
made
by
the
government
and
i'm
trying
to
be
as
brief
as
i
can
and
--
but
i
do
want
to
be
clear.
i
don't
know
that
i
shall
be
that
at
all
but
i
want
to
be.
since
haynes
had
neither
capital
nor
labor
and
since
this
benefit
fund
came
to
him
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
the
length
of
his
employment
with
the
telephone
company
and
by
reason
of
the
provisions
of
the
plan
of
the
telephone
company
which
has
given
to
each
employee
as
the
employee
starts
to
work
for
the
telephone
company.
and
the
employee
has
to
do
two
years
work
for
the
telephone
company
without
the
provisions
or
any
benefit
at
all,
sickness
or
disability
or
accident
before
he
begins
to
receive
any
benefit
from
the
plan.
now
we
say
in
our
contention
is
that
this
is
obliged
to
be
insurance
because
we
don't
pay
people
for
being
sick.
we
can't
afford
to
pay
people
for
being
sick.
it
is
their
sickness
and
not
their
services
that
brings
this
benefit
to
the
employee.
if
we
could
say
as
it's
sometimes
contended
that
well
the
telephone
company
then
has
a
plan
which
makes
sickness
and
accident
profitable,
then
we
should
reverse
our
philosophy
with
reference
to
those
--
to
disadvantages
and
arrange
some
way
to
have
as
many
accidents
and
as
much
sickness
as
possible
in
order
to
profit
by
that,
but
that's
inconsistent.
that's
an
inconsistency.
that
is
not
the
way
human
affairs
ran
and
that
is
not
the
way
business
is
ran.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
not
under
this
plan.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
there
are
no
sickness
benefits
paid
to
employees
under
the
plan
for
the
first
week
he
is
absent
from
his
job.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
no.
he
draws
nothing
under
the
plan
the
first
week
because
of
his
illness.
he
doesn't
get
anything.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
the
original
sick
leave,
he
gets
nothing
the
first
seven
days
that
is
described
in
the
plan.
another
point
of
distinction
if
i
may
proceed
is
that
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
is
not
licensed
in
the
state
of
georgia
to
rate
sickness
and
disability
insurance.
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
in
the
state
of
georgia
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
is
a
self-insurer.
now
we
do
not
contend
and
we
think
that
we
are
not
compelled
to
contend
the
logical
argument
that
that
of
itself
weren't
authorized
the
southern
bell
telephone
company
to
write
or
issue,
sickness
and
accident
benefit
insurance.
we
do
contend
that
this
plan
has
been
in
effect,
it's
in
the
record
since
1913.
there
have
been
instances
since
the
inauguration
of
this
plan
in
1913
where
in
many
instances,
the
benefits
received
by
employees
of
the
telephone
company
have
been
held
to
be
exempt.
i
have
one
of
those
instances
here
a
moment
ago.
back
in
1918,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
question
came
up
before
the
tax
commissioner.
the
supreme
court
under
the
date
of
may
the
20th,
1918
and
in
other
cases
where
in
reference
has
made
to
case
of
stratton's
independence
against
howbert,
231
u.s.399
to
page
415.
it
was
stated
that
income
maybe
define
as
gain
derived
from
capital,
from
labor,
or
from
both.
it
is
therefore
held
that
the
amounts
received
by
an
employee
or
his
personal
representative
from
a
benefit
fund
which
represents
payment
on
account
of
death,
sickness
or
injury
of
an
employee
is
not
income
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
form
of
the
very
grave
issues,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
this
case
is
what
congress
intended.
frankly
--
mr.
john
h.
hudson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
h.
hudson
it
is.
whether
the
congress
intended
that
this
type
of
benefit
is
taxable
or
not
taxable.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
it
is
so
voluminous
mr.
justice
as
i
simply
haven't
a
time
nor
the
physical
strength
--
mr.
john
h.
hudson
we've
got
set
out
and
partially
set
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
h.
hudson
now,
may
it
please
your
honor,
the
government
starts
back
with
the
history
of
this
particular
matter
as
taxation
or
taxation
viewpoint
and
a
taxation
question
and
it
comes
on
down
and
the
government
has
certainly
prepared
and
we
appreciate
a
brilliant
brief
on
this
â€“
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
say
a
little
question?
on
up
to
1954,
the
amendment
which
congress
enacted
specifically
in
exempting
this
type
of
benefit.
now
the
government
takes
this
view
and
we
appreciate
that
the
only
thing
that
congress
did
in
1954
when
they
put
on
the
amendment
which
specifically
exempted
compensation
or
benefits
received
under
the
plan
or
benefits
received
in
the
nature
of
sickness
and
accident
benefits.
the
government
takes
a
view
of
it
that
that
is
not
to
be
interpreted
as
broadening
the
exemption,
that
this
to
be
taken,
that
is
to
be
viewed
in
a
limited
sense
and
simply
applies
to
the
exemption
and
is
to
be
construed
in
a
restricted
sense.
now
the
government
begins
with
the
history
of
this
taxation
and
comes
all
up
to
that
particular
point
and
it
didn't
appear
brilliant
and
a
very
skillful
manner
we
think.
now
we
start
right,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
we
go
back
down
to
the
same
trail
that
the
government
comes
up.
it
is
our
opinion
and
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
what
they
did,
what
congress
did
in
1954
was
illustrated
of
the
intent
of
congress
at
the
time
they
made
that
amendment,
that
all
the
time,
these
questions
were
coming
up
from
1913,
1918,
1924
and
questions
arose
that
the
tax
commissioner
was
referenced
to
some
claims,
was
in
doubt
that's
in
the
case
of
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company,
december
24,
1918
when
they
rule
that
this
kind
of
compensation
or
this
kind
of
income
was
not
taxable.
and
then
we
drew
along
a
little
bit
further
in
the
history
of
this
taxation
when
the
tax
commissioners
in
various
places
held
that
it
was
gross
income
and
that
it
was
taxable.
now
taking
the
1954
amendment
which
was
put
through
by
congress
as
indicating
or
a
circumstance
which
may
indicate
an
act
which
--
from
which
we
might
infer
that
all
the
time,
all
these
years
from
1913
to
1954,
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
exempt
funds
received
from
this
type
of
benefit.
in
other
words,
this
particular
kind
of
insurance.
now
that
is
exactly
we
know,
contract
to
the
contention
of
the
government.
now
here,
we
have
a
--
we
have
live,
we
have
a
vital
issue
not
affecting
compensation
received
under
this
plan
or
any
other
employer-employee
plan
but
affecting
a
large
number
of
claims
now
pending
in
the
various
circuit
courts
of
this
country
under
this
plan
and
similar
plans
as
to
their
earnings
up
to
and
during
1939.
now
we
say
very
frankly,
candidly
that
if
this
honorable
court
takes
our
view
of
it,
makes
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
it
follows
on
necessity
that
the
government
will
lose
some
revenue.
but
we
also
take
this
viewpoint,
it's
our
contention
that
this
nontaxable
income
is
correct,
then
the
withholding
of
these
funds
--
pardon
me
please
--
from
these
taxpayers
in
the
various
circuit
courts
did
not
give
the
government
a
title
to
these
funds
or
this
particular
fund
as
they're
sticking
straight
to
this
case.
and
in
as
much
as
it
did
not,
in
as
much
as
the
government
as
we
contend
collected
it
illegally,
it
never
had
the
title
to
it.
it
was
not
entitled
under
the
law
if
our
contention
is
correct,
to
receive
these
funds
or
hold
these
funds.
therefore,
in
the
estimate,
advised
by
the
government
and
we
got
no
right
to
dispute
it.
it
isn't
--
we've
got
no
way
of
disputing
it
successfully
even
if
it
is
a
mere
estimate
that
approximately
$6
million
are
involved.
we
say
that
our
position
is
direct
if
we
are
right,
then
all
of
the
funds
that
are
being
held
now
by
the
tax
commission
since
1949
and
even
prior
of
that
time
up
to
the
statute
of
limitation.
it
is
holding
--
it
is
withholding
those
funds
from
the
taxpayers
illegally,
therefore
an
order
requiring
the
commissioner
to
make
these
various
refunds
in
whatever
amount
is
perfectly
all
right
because
the
government
is
not
really
losing
anything
that
it
was
entitled
to.
now
there
is
another
side
of
course
to
this
argument.
while
some
$6
million
in
funds
probably
more,
probably
less
are
involved
in
actual
dollars
and
cents.
there
is
a
large
number
of
employees
of
the
various
companies
through
the
years
have
founded
beneficial
to
inaugurate
or
establish
a
plan
although
no
cash
premiums
are
required
in
order
to
receive
the
benefits
under
the
plan.
thank
you.
i
meant
to
divide
my
--
mr.
john
h.
hudson
thank
you.
i
intended
to
divide
my
argument
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
put
logical,
concise
argument
within
the
30
minutes
period.
i'm
just
a
country
boy
and
i'm
rather
slow.
what
about
the
large
number
of
employees
who
may
i
say
have
a
vested
interest
in
these
benefits?
they
have
done
the
work.
they
have
earned
it.
they
have
satisfied
the
employees.
they
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
under
this
plan.
now
to
cut
them
off
and
say
that
this
is
taxable
income
when
they
started
out
under
the
idea
that
it
is
nontaxable
income,
we
say
that
is
a
very
widespread
injury
that
is
going
to
and
necessary
result
to
a
lot
of
people
that
involves
probably
is
going
to
fall
on
employees
who
are
least
able
to
withstand
that
motion.
gentlemen,
may
i
thank
you
for
the
time
and
the
privilege
to
appear
--
appearing
before
this
court
and
presenting
a
few
scattered
ideas
on
a
very
important
question.
