increases,
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
you
use
the
word
benefit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
pretty
good
choice
isn't
it?
that's
what
you
have
in
all
the
insurance
policy,
sick
benefits
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
always
call
in
private
insurance
companies,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
they
call
it
here?
sickness
disability
benefit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
use
payment
anywhere
in
the
plan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
precisely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
looked
at
it
and
i
can
see
very
little
difference
in
the
kind
of
contract
they
made
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
contract
for
sick
benefits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
year
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.

is
there
any
indication
that
that
was
the
belief
of
congress
in
the
1944
act
when
they
limited
the
amount
of
1956?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
said
about
that
in
the
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
said
about
that
desire
to
keep
the
president?
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
can
do
that
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
said
in
any
of
the
trial
reports
with
reference
to
this
bill,
this
exemption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
its
first
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was

the
committee
why
he
wanted
to
exempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
disability,
sickness
of
that
form?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
reason
did
they
give
for
wanting
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
indication
and
i
presume
you've
read
those
reports
hearing?
were
there
any
indication
and
that
some
of
them
thought
that
it
is
just
bad
policy
to
tax
people
or
income
received
on
account
of
sick
benefits?

the
record
wholly

any
of
the

they
want
to

hugo
