what's
the
first
alternative
you're
proposing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
zarky,
haynes
--
what
was
haynes
--
was
employed
by
the
southern
bell
telephone
in
what
evidence
he
was
a
subordinate
capacity
judging
from
his
salary,
what
was
he
actually
doing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
have
been
one
of
--
i
don't
know
what,
lineman
or
something
like
that.
well
now,
he
is
actually
wasn't
rendering
during
his
years
of
illness
personal
services
and
the
only
fair
way
of
saying
he
was
considered
compensation
for
personal
services
is
to
treat
him
the
way
clients
treat
a
lawyer
who
is
on
the
retainers
so
that
whenever
they
want,
they
can
qualify,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
certainly
didn't
render
any
services
except
that
he
rendered
in
the
past
when
they
were
looking
forward
to
his
service
in
the
future,
but
this
money
was
not
compensation
for
service
in
any
colloquial
sense
of
the
english
language
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
you
say
that
a
fellow
who
is
sick
a
whole
year
and
didn't
--
couldn't
lift
to
figure
for
getting
compensation
for
services
if
you're
talking,
forgetting
all
about
your
duty
here,
would
you
talk
that
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
he
--
there
might
be
--
there
might
be
this
alternative.
why
not
you
say
either
compensation
or
an
ordinary
insurance
policy?
it
certainly
to
say
this
is
compensation
for
service
is
taking
some
liberty
with
the
english
language,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
with
tax
language.
i'm
saying
with
the
english.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
economic?
you
talk
economics
when
you're
not
engaged
in
practicing
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
like
a
christmas
bonus,
that's
a
compounding
of
an
extra
which
is
calculated
at
the
end
of
what
he
has
done
and
all
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
you
really
--
you
make
heavy
demands
on
one
full
creature.
i
have
much
more
sympathy
with
mr.
hudson's
testing
this
is
a
small
case,
but
you
want
me
to
decide
this
in
the
light
of
the
american
economy,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
be
doing
it
if
i
didn't
have
the
exemption
in
file.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
going
to
stretch
the
compensation
part,
i
will
scratch
--
stretch
the
insurance
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
does
an
insurance
company
if
it's
a
money
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
during
the
insurance
policy.
they're
sometimes
a
nonpaying
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
some
insurance
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
hospital
insurance
is
a
period
of
non-benefit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
workmen's
compensation
act
as
a
period
of
non-benefits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
if
you
had
no
exemption
and
you
had
to
construe
that,
you
wouldn't
be
saying,
you
use
it
with
utmost
breadth,
but
i'd
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
i'm
doing
something
like
that
and
i
wouldn't
be
building
a
great
big
vast
(inaudible)
the
american
economy
and
then
say
therefore,
the
american
economy
requires
that
we
satisfy
as
ordinary
human
beings
without
going
into
congressional
intent.
the
first
second
and
third
manifestation
of
intent
for
me
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
just
as
broad
when
you
come
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
be
just
as
broad
take
into
account
all
these
impractical
appealing
factors
that
you
did
on
the
compensation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
period
of
illness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know,
but
that
--
that
shows
that
they
want
to
take
care
of
the
great
body
of
workmen
--
of
employees,
$100
a
week
means
$5000
a
year
which
takes
care
of
a
lot
of
these.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
trade
union,
you're
in
an
insurance
schemes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
commercial,
would
they
be
excluded?
a
number
of
the
powerful
unions
have
their
own
insurance
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
who
made
that
interpretation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
did
that?
that
must
be
a
funded
plan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
don't
you
turn
on
that
if
a
great
big
enterprise
says
we
don't
have
to
have
a
separate
fund.
we
ensure
you
that
we'll
sort
of
make
a
rough
calculation.
is
that
--
your
calculations
have
often
turned
out
to
be
very
loose
and
undependable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
23
mr.
zarky?
