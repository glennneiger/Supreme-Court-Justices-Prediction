if
this
man
has
been
absent
for
work
for
a
week,
he
can
sick
leave
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
no?
you
get
it
under
the
ordinary
operations
of
the
company?
what
i
want
you
to
get
--
will
you
draw
a
distinction
between
in
relation
to
sick
leave
and
the
payments
he
gets
during
the
period
and
the
relationship
between
the
period
he
gets
to
an
extended
period.
unknown
speaker
he
just
continues
to
draw
his
pay?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
sick
leave.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zarky,
do
you
remember
i
asked
mr.
hudson
what
the
difference
was
between
what
i
call
during
the
first
seven
days
that
a
man
might
be
out
in
his
payment,
and
here
applies
that
there
would
be
no
payment
during
the
first
seven
days.
no
brief
has
a
statement
because
i
like
to
have
explained.
it
says
although
employees
with
conflict
offenses
continue
to
receive
their
regular
salary
during
the
first
seven
days
of
illness,
a
benefit
not
provided
by
the
plan.
these
payments
which
are
maybe
recognizable
taxable
sick
leave
payments
are
indistinguishable
under
the
plan.
