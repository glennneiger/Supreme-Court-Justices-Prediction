harlan
i
suppose
the
basic
question
is
the
sentence
in
which
congress
used
the
term
health
insurance
whether
commercial
health
insurance
or
whether
a
plan
like
yours
it
has
all
the
features
of
an
insurance
program.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
is
the
legislative
history
show
on
it,
is
there
any?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
got
it
in
the
brief
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
these
are
not
a
funded
plan,
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
the
money
come
from
that
they
pay
out
these
general?
justice
john
m.
harlan

is
that?
