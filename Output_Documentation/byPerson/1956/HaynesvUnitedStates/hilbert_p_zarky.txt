mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
mr.
hudson's
remark
what
this
court
has
a
narrow
little
question
of
statutory
construction.
these
are
the
statute
in
question
which
was
governing
during
the
years
here
in
controversy.
here
are
some
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
40
up
to
page
41
that
being
code
section
22
(b)
(5).
it
creates
an
exemption
from
tax
--
i'll
skip
the
opening
part
of
the
sentence
which
has
no
relation
to
our
problem
here.
it
exempts
amounts
received
through
accident
or
health
insurance
or
under
workmen's
compensation
act,
compensation
for
personal
injuries
or
sickness.
those
are
the
amounts
which
are
exempt
from
tax.
at
the
beginning
of
the
page
appears
old
section
22
(a)
with
which
this
court
has
had
much
familiarity
where
congress
has
defined
in
the
broadest
terms
possible,
its
concepts
of
what
is
taxable
income.
and
of
course
included
in
section
22
(a)
is
compensation
for
personal
services.
so
the
definitional
section
includes
compensation
for
personal
services
and
the
exclusion
section
exempts
amounts
received
for
sickness
under
health
insurance.
and
so
the
question
here
really
is
this,
where
an
employer
either
voluntarily
or
pursuant
to
a
plan
as
it's
true
in
this
case,
undertakes
to
tell
its
employees
that
we
will
continue
to
pay
you
in
whole
or
in
part
some
part
of
your
salary
during
some
periods
that
you
maybe
ill.
is
that
compensation
for
personal
services
as
the
government
contends?
or
is
that
amounts
received
for
illness
under
health
insurance
which
congress
has
exempted
under
section
22
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
this
is
compensation
for
personal
services.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
your
honor,
we'll
turn
to
page
89
of
the
record.
you
have
defendant's
exhibit
number
one
which
starts
at
page
88.
as
i
recall,
this
is
part
of
the,
one
of
the
annual
statements
of
southern
bell
telephone
company.
and
toward
the
bottom
of
page
89,
there
is
paragraph
dealing
with
sickness
and
accidents
and
it
says
at
the
second
line,
a
total
of
$1,700,000
is
paid
as
sickness
disability
benefits
under
the
plan
and
$1,090,000
for
sickness
pay
during
the
first
seven
days
of
absence
was
charged
a
departmental
expense.
you'll
immediately
see
that
the
amounts
paid
during
his
first
seven
days
are
not
substantially
less
than
the
amount
paid
under
the
plan.
the
only
difference
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
under
the
plan
which
the
company
of
course
had
the
right
to
change
it
anytime.
but
under
the
plan,
precisely
what
you
would
receive
was
set
forth
while
during
the
first
seven
days,
it
was
discretionary
for
the
company
to
pay
or
not
to
pay.
but
i
would
guess
from
these
figures
that
the
company
exercises
discretion
mostly
to
pay
and
that's
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
between
what
was
paid
during
the
first
seven
days
and
what
would
be
paid
after,
inclusion
of
the
first
week
of
illness
and
yet
the
contention
here
of
that
is
that
what's
paid
under
the
first
seven
days
is
not
exempt
and
what's
paid
after
the
first
seven
days
is
exempt.
in
our
view,
both
payments
as
i
shall
develop
i
hope
is
compensation
for
services
rendered
or
to
be
rendered
by
the
employee
and
it's
nothing
more
or
less
than
that.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
don't
think
the
record
shows.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no.
i
think
it
goes
deep
in
that
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
it
is.
i
may
develop
that
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
absent
is
showing
that
this
was
a
gratuity
or
benevolence,
then
i
say
that's
all
it
could
be.
that's
all
an
employer
can
pay
his
employees,
is
compensation
for
services
rendered
in
the
past
and
had
a
reward
or
an
inducement
for
future
services
and
a
plan
like
this
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
not
in
my
own
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no,
i
think
in
economic
language.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
let
me
develop
my
point
if
i
may
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
that
our
economy
as
long
as
the
time
when
we
think
of
compensation
as
being
paid
pro
rata,
per
hour
of
services
rendered.
the
whole
american
economy
has
developed
a
system
whereby
private
industry
is
really
implementing
what
the
government
had
try
to
do
to
social
security
programs,
of
leveling
out
salaries,
of
keeping
labor
turnover
down
to
a
minimum
and
the
southern
bell
telephone
plan
here
is
one
of
the
ways
on
which
it
has
done.
for
example,
set
this
is
not
the
only
benefit
pay.
payments
are
made
on
debt.
payments
are
made
on
debt
depending
on
length
service.
payments
are
made
for
accidental
injury,
not
attributable
to
employment
or
covered
by
workmen's
compensation,
the
christmas
bonus,
it's
not
on
this
plan,
is
a
well
known
measure
of
compensation
in
american
industry.
in
recent
years,
stock
option
plans,
pension
funds,
profit
sharing,
a
whole
(inaudible)
of
methods
of
compensation
which
cannot
be
related
to
precise
hours
of
work
has
taken
its
place
in
the
picture
of
compensation
in
the
american
economy.
a
pension
which
is
played
on
retirement
is
not
a
gratuity,
it's
not
a
benevolence,
the
employee
is
paying
--
employer
is
paying
that
because
he
hopes
that
by
offering
this
inducement,
his
employee
will
stay
in
employment
for
a
long
period
of
time.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
design
to
induce
him
to
stay
in
employment
and
not
to
go
to
somebody
else.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
no.
i
want
your
honor
to
see
that
you
can't
equate
compensation
with
hours
of
service
and
pay
for
each
hour
of
service.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
i
want
to
get
the
exact
--
i
want
us
first
to
get
the
--
across
my
idea
that
this
is
compensation
which
is
not
at
all,
does
not
all
leaving
(inaudible)
prior
from
my
opinion.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i'll
get
to
that
when
--
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
but
i
would
first
like
to
show
why
this
must
be
compensation
because
a
corporation
doesn't
give
its
money
away.
it's
in
place
that
the
employees
for
what
they
perform
in
a
way
of
services.
it
could
not
--
it
could
not
make
gratuity.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
except
an
insurance
company
gets
paid.
and
why
i
say
that
the
employer
here
is
paying,
he's
paying
for
services
rendered
in
the
past
or
induced
to
be
rendered
in
the
future.
for
example
a
plan
here
is
one
where
for
the
first
two
years
of
employment,
nothing
has
paid
during
the
time
you're
ill
and
as
your
length
in
service
increases,
the
amount
of
benefits
you
receive
are
increased.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
not
with
--
not
with
--
with
accident
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
but
it
would
not
increase
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
but
here
was
--
what
we're
dealing
with
is
the
employer
and
the
employee
and
the
fact
that
the
period
of
employment
when
increasing,
increases
the
benefits
received
by
the
employee
is
only
suggesting
that
compensation
is
intended.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
said
the
benefit
which
the
employee
received.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
payments
received.
i'm
not
trying
to
prejudge
the
case
by
a
poor
choice
of
language.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that
would
be
called
benefits.
that
would
be
called
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
or
insurance
proceeds?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
believe
that's
the
word
used.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well
i
think
that
(inaudible)
that
do
i
found
words
of
payment
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
--
payments
to
be
made
here.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
think
the
court
would
realize
that
the
case
can't
turn
on
a
small
bits
or
nuisance
of
language
used
in
the
plan.
what
i
like
to
get
to
is
the
question
of
congressional
intent,
but
my
preliminary
point
justice
frankfurter
is
i
don't
think
i'm
misusing
english
language
in
saying
that
what
flows
to
employer
to
be
employee
is
normally
compensatory
for
services
rendered.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
well
i
have
--
i
haven't
reached
section
22
(b).
i
was
merely
saying
that
this
is
included
in
the
broad
concept
of
22
(a)
and
now
we
passed
the
question,
"does
22
(b)
(5)
taken
out
of
interest
by
granting
an
exclusion.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
congress
so
intended,
of
course
and
it
has
done
so
in
the
1954
code
where
it
made
its
intention
clear
that
payments
made
by
employers
during
absence
from
work
are
exempt,
but
congress
put
in
a
very
limited
exception
in
1954,
only
$100
a
week
no
matter
what
the
salary
of
the
employee
is
and
nothing
during
the
first
week
of
illness,
so
that
well
under
the
taxpayer's
argument
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
first
week
of
his
period
of
illness.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
the
only
difference
is
that
on
the
taxpayer's
destruction
of
1939
code,
the
president
of
the
company,
doing
a
salary
of
$75,000
and
ill
for
a
year
would
have
$75,000
exempt.
well
congress
when
it
spoke
on
the
matter
after
study
included
that
only
a
$100
a
week
should
be
exempt.
so
that
when
we
get
to
what
congress
intended,
it
speaks
--
it
seems
to
be
with
clarity
in
1954
and
we
think
it's
a
piece
of
clarity
before
1954
in
the
opposite
direction.
the
origin
of
the
statute
itself
indicates
to
us
that
congress
was
thinking
in
terms
of
ordinary
commercial
policies
of
insurance.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
in
its
origin
which
would
indicate
that
congress
was
speaking
in
terms
of
an
employer's
plan
to
continue
paying
compensation,
wages
or
it
might
during
the
period
when
an
employee
was
absent
from
work.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
if
there
were
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes,
yes.
there's
a
fund
set
up
to
which
the
employee
has
made
contributions
together
with
the
employer
and
if
it
was
not
related
to
length
of
service,
it
has
been
considered
to
be
insurance
within
22
(b)
(5),
but
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
is
not
a
funded
plan.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
general
expenses,
discharged
by
the
company
the
general
expense.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
congress
put
the
1954
code
provisions
into
effect,
the
legislative
history
indicated
its
understanding
that
under
the
1939
code,
the
language
you
here
have
to
construe
only
a
funded
plan
met
the
narrow
exclusion
which
congress
intended
to
create
when
it
put
in
this
exemption.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
sir?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
the
report
of
the
committee
of
the
house.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well,
i
won't
argue
the
wisdom
of
whether
it
should
or
shouldn't
be.
i'm
merely
stating
that
was
congressional
understanding
of
what
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
that's
what
the
committee
report
indicates
when
it
states
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
we
quote
excerpts
from
it
and
on
page
23
of
our
brief
beginning
with
the
paragraph
that's
numbered
1
there.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
was
in
1954
when
a
new
code
was
adopted
and
when
this
$100
a
week
exclusion
was
specifically
put
in
so
that
today
this
kind
of
problem
would
not
arise.
it
would
be
clear
that
only
up
to
$100
a
week
could
be
excluded
and
that
anything
over
that
amount
would
be
taxable.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
page
23
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes,
of
the
--
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
excerpts
there
from
the
committee
report
on
the
1954
code
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes
sir.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
well
it
dealt
with
the
whole
question
of
insurance
comprehensibly
and
so
far
as
the
statute
relates
to
the
kind
of
problem
presented
by
this
case
where
the
employer
makes
payments,
not
to
any
insurance
company.
then
what
the
employee
receive
is
up
to
$100
a
week
but
only
after
$100
a
week
is
exempt
while
the
contention
being
made
by
the
taxpayer
here
is
under
the
1939
code,
everything
was
exempt
no
matter
what
the
amount
and
our
dealing
of
the
legislative
history
of
1954
code
probably
show
that
congress
was
not
cutting
down
an
exemption
that
it
thought
existed
on
the
1939
code.
congress
thought
it
was
creating
something
which
wasn't
in
existence
under
the
1939
code.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
the
general
tenor,
what's
said
and
what's
not
said
and
we
have
a
succinct
illusion
here
of
a
several
pages
of
comment
by
the
committee,
but
what
we
have
here
we
think
is
still
the
thought
that
you
get
from
the
entire
report
that
congress
was
changing
a
law
and
changing
it
in
this
limited
respect.
the
fact
that
congress
had
a
definite
notion
of
what
is
insurance
and
what
is
not
insurance,
we
think
is
also
evident
by
another
amendments
that
took
place
in
related
areas
between
1918
and
1954.
for
example,
from
the
very
beginning,
amounts
received
as
life
insurance
had
been
exempt
for
income
tax.
now
then
the
question
would
arise
paralleling
this
case
where
under
a
plan
of
the
employer
and
its
part
of
the
plan
to
which
this
employer
had
certain
lump
sum
payments
are
made
to
a
widow
or
other
beneficiaries
when
an
employee
dies,
is
that
insurance?
now
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
taxpayer's
argument
here
that
payments
during
illness
is
insurance,
by
wide
token
and
payments
on
death
or
to
be
regarded
as
life
insurance.
and
yet,
it
was
not
until
1951
that
congress
put
in
a
special
exemption
where
amounts
paid
by
an
employer
to
an
employees
beneficiaries
on
death
and
then
put
in
a
limited
exemption,
limited
amount
so
that
from
this
i
would
draw
some
conclusions.
the
first
that
when
congress
spoke
about
insurance,
it
had
a
very
definite
concept
in
mind
and
it
didn't
think
that
in
payments
made
by
an
employer
to
an
employee
or
to
an
employee's
beneficiary
were
insurance.
secondly,
that
when
congress
with
the
social
objective
in
mind
has
created
this
kind
of
an
exemption
is
done
limited
in
amount.
in
other
words,
i
think
lurking
in
there
is
the
feeling
that
companies
cannot
create
large
reserves
for
their
favorite
officers
and
get
a
tax
exemption
that
was
never
intended
to
encompass
that.
in
other
words,
if
the
president
of
the
company
is
sick,
congress
didn't
intend
that
his
entire
salary
during
illness
should
be
exempt
and
the
president
of
the
company
will
receive
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
his
death
from
the
company.
congress
didn't
intend
that
that
should
be
exempted
as
life
insurance.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
1954
act?
i
think
that
is
evident
from
that
what's
done
in
all
--
the
whole
area
fringe
benefits.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
not
precisely,
your
honor
but
if
you
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
there
were
some
hearings,
yes.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
i
don't
think
so
particularly
justice
black.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
this
--
this
particular
exemption?
i
think
not
but
if
you
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
in
1918.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
insurance?
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
yes.
but
actually
the
statute
had
a
very
limited
and
interesting
history
because
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
treasury
--
may
i
take
just
a
moment
because
i
can't
answer
two
succinctly.
the
treasury
had
originally
ruled
before
the
1918
statute
that
amounts
received
under
acts
of
insurance
was
taxable
income.
then
the
question
reached
attorney
general
gregory
and
taking
some
decisions
of
this
court
like
lynch
against
hornby
i
believe,
southern
pacific
against
lowe,
classic
decisions
of
where
the
court
use
broad
pronouncement
of
what
is
income.
he
distilled
from
that
the
idea
not
only
that
acts
and
insurance
couldn't
be
income
but
because
the
human
body
was
regarded
by
attorney
general
gregory
as
capital
which
was
not
being
replaced,
he
thought
this
couldn't
constitutionally
be
taxed
as
income.
it
was
a
notion
which
under
prevalent
concepts
of
income
which
scarcely
withstand
analysis,
but
anyway,
it
was
within
that
background
that
the
1918
enactment
was
made
and
congress
specifically
said
in
the
committee
report
that
it
was
doubtful
under
the
present
law
whether
amounts
received
to
acts
and/or
health
insurance
or
under
workmen's
compensation,
et
cetera
are
required
to
be
included
in
gross
income.
in
other
words,
they
thought
there
was
a
constitutional
inability
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
no.
i
think
there
is
no
committee
report
indicate
no
more
than
an
attempt
to
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
1954
code
shows
it's
a
good
idea
to
give
an
exemption
in
a
limited
amount.
mr.
hilbert
p.
zarky
the
1954
code,
