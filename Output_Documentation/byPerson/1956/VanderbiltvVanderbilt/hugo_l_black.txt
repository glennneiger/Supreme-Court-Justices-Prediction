the
page
that
you're
referring
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
got
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
first
what
you
understand
the
issue
legally
should
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
the
--
what
you
understand
that
these
are
legal
issues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
issue
here
but
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
other
issues
that
you
understand,
this
legal
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
besides
the
fact
that
the
difference
between
you.
he
says
you
have
not
--
the
new
york
did
not
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
this
divorce
decree.
you
say
they
did
because
they
recognize
it
as
dissolution
of
the
marriage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
is
the
other
ground
which
you
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had,
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
is,
you
say
they
did
not
purport
to
do
it.
in
the
other
deals
as
you
say
if
they
did
purport
to
do
it,
they
didn't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so.

justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
the
liberty
of
course
to
argue
that
we
decided
and
rather
trying
to
believe
with
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
argue
with
the
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
argue
what
you
think
about
the
rest
of
the
opinion
too
if
you
decide
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
will
extend
your
time
if
you
lose
too
much
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
this
case
if
you
--
if
you
don't
have
enough
time,
i
will
extend
your
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
you
sit
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
wife
had
gone
to
nevada
instead
of
the
husband
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
there
have
been
constructive
service
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
she
have
gotten
a
decree
for
alimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
valid?
suppose
they
had
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
ordered
there
now
that
she
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
allowed
to
take
his
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
divided
--
decided
that
he
be
allowed
so
much
for
than
a
half
his
property,
would
that
have
been
a
valid
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
having
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
position
--
your
position
is
that
the
husband
can
get
a
valid
decree
depriving
the
right
of
alimony
on
constructive
service
but
she
cannot
get
a
valid
decree
granted
for
alimony
on
constructive
service,
it
maybe
a
good
position,
that
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
constitutional
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
make
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
make
my
position
clear
and
i
don't
clear
this
out.
i
just
wanted
to
get
your
view.
what
is
your
view
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
it
would
form
a
due
process
for
a
wife
or
a
husband
to
have
a
wife
denied
alimony,
now
that
she
has
a
stay
on
constructive
service,
constitutionally
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
case?
let's
forget
this
case
for
the
moment
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
