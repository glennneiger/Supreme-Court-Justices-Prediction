the
court
of
appeals
held
for
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
nevada
law,
doesn't
that
mean
that
nevada
determined
that
she
was
not
entitled
in
--
in
alimony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
about
the
sweeney
case
in
--
was
that
the
name
of
it
in
nevada?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
in
new
york
as
holding
according
to
the
new
york's
interpretation
of
the
nevada
law
that
the
decree
does
have
the
effect
that
your
opponent
claims
under
nevada
law,
irrespective
of
whether
constitutionally
it
could
have
that
effect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
question
to
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
one
would
conclude
that
nevada
undertook
to
adjudicate
alimony
and
assuming
that
the
further
conclusion
that
constitutionally,
it
had
the
power
to
do
so,
what's
left
of
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
--
assuming
your
client
had
gone
into
florida
which
she
had
no
connection
whatever,
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
any
different
from
your
standpoint
than
it
is
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
she
had
gone
into
florida
with
which
she
had
no
connection
prior
to
the
nevada
decree
and
had
then
gone
in,
in
florida
and
had
a
statute
of
this
kind
which
she
had
sought
to
avail
herself
of
the
florida
statute,
would
your
case
be
any
different
in
your
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
isn't
quite
my
point.
as
i
take
it
in
your
answer
to
me
you
indicate
that
whether
she
was
domiciled
in
new
york
or
not,
it
is
a
matter
of
irrelevancy
so
far
as
your
position
is
concerned.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
florida
had
had
a
statute
like
new
york
and
said
anybody
after
20
days
of
residence
in
the
state
can
maintain
this
kind
of
an
action.
would
your
case
be
any
different
from
your
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
we
have
here
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this,
is
it
your
view
that
this
nevada
decree
was
not
entitled
to
a
full
faith
and
credit
so
far
as
alimony
is
concerned
in
any
state,
no
matter
what
the
defendant's
--
what
your
client's
connection
with
that
state
was?
if
i
already
chose
to
take
jurisdiction
ten
years
from
now
to
entertain
your
client's
action,
ten
years
after
the
divorce
in
nevada,
could
it
be
your
position
that
florida
then
could
say
notwithstanding
the
--
the
nevada
decree
will
take
jurisdiction
and
adjudicate
alimony?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--your
position
rests
on
this
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
the
other
subject?
under
your
view
of
estin
and
estin,
it
would
mean
that
any
dissatisfied
wife
could
shop
around
for
any
jurisdiction
that
she
has
thought
most
favorable
and
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
particular
jurisdiction,
get
an
alimony
adjudication
despite
the
nevada
decree
as
it
would
be
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
and
recognize
it
but
you
--
as
i
understood
you
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter,
you
would
say
you
--
you
prepared
to
argue
that
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
what
you're
saying
in
fact
is
that
the
domiciliary
relationship
of
your
client
to
new
york
gave
new
york
a
sufficient
interest
so
that
the
point
of
view
of
full
faith
and
credit,
it
did
not
have
to
recognize
the
nevada
decree.
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
in
that,
you're
assuming
(a),
that
nevada
undertook
to
adjudicate
alimony
and
(b),
that
it
had
the
right
to
adjudicate
alimony.
you're
willing
to
assume
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that
but
of
course
if
you're
right
in
that
then
all
of
this
talk
about
whether
she
was
domiciled
or
not
becomes
irrelevant
because
nevada
would
not
have
the
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
couldn't
have
adjudicated
alimony.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
when
you
--
when
you
go
back
to
your
domiciliary
point,
it
must
be
on
the
assumption
that
nevada
undertook
to
and
could
constitutionally
adjudicate
that
right.
and
on
constant
because
of
new
york's
interest
in
the
--
in
the
status
of
this
woman,
it
did
not
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
am
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
in
my
hope
to
deem
on
that,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
are
right
in
that
then
it
seems
to
me
the
case
is
over.
you
won
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
without
regard
to
what
connection
this
woman
had,
without
connection
to
what
stage
you
sued
in
or
without
anything
more.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
is
--
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
position
you
take
referring
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
can't
possibly
conflict
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
if
--
if
either
nevada
shouldn't
undertake
to
adjudicate
alimony
which
is
armstrong
against
armstrong
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
or
if,
although
it
did
undertake
to
adjudicate
alimony,
it
had
no
power
to
do
so
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
under
your
interpretation
of
estin
against
estin.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
everything
else
that
you've
argued
is
unnecessary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
argument
is
sort
of
a
stand
off,
isn't
it?
they're
both
ex
parte.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
opponents
got
a
pretty
good
argument
on
his
side
to
rebut
all
that.
this
isn't
a
case
of
the
ordinary
quickie
divorce,
this
man
was
domiciled
out
there,
and
this
is
as
far
as
this
record
shows.
and
so
far
as
the
in
personam
character
of
the
divorce
decree
why
you
are
simply
begging
for
question
that's
involved
in
estin
--
estin
against
estin.
