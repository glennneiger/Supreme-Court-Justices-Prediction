justice

frankfurter
is
there
a
--
is
there
a
court
of
appeals
decision
that
residents
means
domicile?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
lot
of
things
that
are
well-known
that
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
--
i
don't
quite
follow
you,
mr.
rosenblatt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
from
--
in
view
of
your
last
remark
about
new
york
not
being
honest,
as
you
put
it,
that
if
new
york
had
--
had
been
dishonest
as
you
want
them
to
be
and
just
said
that
a
woman
in
this
situation
could
get
maintenance,
would
that
have
been
all
right,
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
she
--
although,
there'd
been
a
divorce
between
her
and
her
husband
in
a
sister
state
to
which
respect
would
have
to
be
accorded
by
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
your
trouble
is
that
--
or
your
--
your
attack
on
this
statute
is
that
although
if
this
same
obligation
could
have
been
imposed,
would
have
been
--
might
have
been
imposed
by
a
statute
which
simply
and
candidly
says,
"mr.
vanderbilt
must
maintain
this
lady
who
once
was
his
wife
and
had
been
dully
divorced,
but
nevertheless
because
she
was
once
his
wife,
new
york
state
has
a
constitutional
interest
that
may
impose
a
maintenance
liability
on
the
husband,
that
would
have
been
all
right."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
all
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
so
that
the
question
comes
--
to
the
question
and
seems
from
your
point
of
view,
they
are
different
--
they
had
a
very
different
--
different
exception
in
this
case.
from
your
point
of
view,
you're
asking
us
to
pursuit
justice
brennan's
question
to
say
that
--
that
those
conditions
which
in
your
--
from
your
point
of
view
would
make
this
a
valid
statute,
namely,
that
there
was
some
type,
some
domiciliary
type
between
this
woman
in
new
york,
that
was
the
precondition
of
the
obligation
and
you
say
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
didn't
--
was
not
warranted
in
the
facts
to
make
such
a
finding,
it
did
make
such
a
finding
and
we
must
overrule
that
finding
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
pursue
it
provided
it's
relevant
or
you
can
pursue
it
anyhow.
that's
--
that's
your
hour.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
of
this
court
is
in
a
position
to
go
behind
determination
of
whether
a
woman
lived
in
new
york
for
a
year
and
how
she
lived
there
whether
permanently
or
anything
else.
all
those
questions
of
constitutionality
rather
than
determinations
of
fact
on
which,
usually,
the
majority
of
a
court
is
a
court's
decision.
how
can
i
tell
whether
who
is
right
or
who
is
wrong?
would
we
take
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
court
has
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
common
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
common
sense
the
--
the
equivalent
or
can
that
dispense
for
the
determination
of
a
whole
judicial
system
to
with
new
york
that
certain
facts
were
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
the
record
on
the
basis
of
which
i
draw
independent
conclusion
to
the
extent
that
there's
no
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
state
court,
is
that
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
conceded
by
the
new
york
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
a
person
has
matrimonial
domicile
and
i
think
in
the
question
of
law,
the
question
of
the
existence
of
the
certain
facts
from
which
a
conclusion
is
drawn.
and
what
you
are
saying
now
is
that
this
record
is
absolutely
so
barren
of
any
support
for
those
underlying
facts
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
based
its
decision
that
no
court
in
reason
could
have
reached
that
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that's
the
proposition
you
have
to
maintain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
dissent
seemed
to
be
popular
with
people
who
have
use
for
them
but
they
are
not
decisions
of
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
legal
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
if
you're
standing
on
as
i
follow
you
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
i
can't
follow
it.
that's
a
legal
proposition,
namely,
i
--
i
adhere
to
that
for
myself
that
you
can't
--
new
york
can't
differentiate
and
treat
disadvantageous
a
divorce
rendered
outside
the
state
for
one
rendered
inside
the
state.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
legal
proposition.
that
is
what
you're
tendering.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
don't
expect
the
--
because
you
don't
accept
the
facts
found
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
then
resting
on
pennoyer
and
neff
that
this
is
a
judgment
of
a
personal
character
and
that
your
client
wasn't
properly
served?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
will
establish
only
one
of
those
proposition
on
which
you're
resting,
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
that's
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
one
of
them.
if
it's
pennoyer
and
neff,
that
ought
to
be
established.
if
it's
discrimination
to
which
you
referred
and
what
i
had
said
in
estin,
i
understand
that.
but
i
can't
understand
asking
me
to
say
that
the
underlying
alleged
facts
found
against
you
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
reviewable
here
except
on
the
theory
of
--
one
of
due
process
because
there's
no
foundation
whatever
as
disclosed
by
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
make
a
difference
or
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
argument
will
be
a
matter
that
makes
no
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
the
legal
issue
--
there
was
no
federal
question
raised
below,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
estin
case
did
not
hold
that.
the
estin
case
is
a
totally
different
proposition.
the
estin
case
holds
that
a
later
divorce
in
nevada
cannot
supplant
an
earlier
imposition
of
obligation
in
new
york
and
that's
all
estin
holds.
the
question
there
was
whether
the
later
divorce
could
displace
an
obligation
which
new
york
had
the
right
at
the
time
that
imposed
it
to
impose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
a
judgment
in
the
maintenance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
support
case
in
estin
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
limiting
the
estin
case
to
what
the
estin
case
was
based
on.
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
last
word
in
a
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'd
like
to
hold
decisions
to
what
they
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
it
wasn't
limited.
it
dealt
with
the
situation
of
whether
a
later
divorce
render
--
can
render
null
and
void
and
displace,
as
i
said
earlier,
a
prior
valid
judgment
by
a
new
york
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
the
case
here
is
the
divorce
in
nevada
prior
thereto
no
obligation
defined
or
exercised
power
to
impose
an
obligation
exercised
by
new
york.
but
after
divorce,
new
york
says,
"this
ex-wife
is
entitled
to
maintenance."
isn't
that
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
appropriate
argument
for
you
to
urge
that
this
court
should
in
this
case
hold
that
that
furnishes
constitutional
power
for
new
york
to
impose
an
obligation.
i'm
trying
to
hold
you
to
what
estin
decided,
and
estin
decided
whether
or
not
nevada
because
she
later
divorced
the
person
who
then
had
a
right
under
the
new
york
--
a
declared
right,
not
an
argumentative
right
out
of
which
you
get
a
right
but
an
existing
declared
obligation
whether
that
was
determining,
whether
that
was
held
because
lately
there
was
a
divorce.
that
--
this
case
is
the
opposite
of
that,
namely,
nevada
comes
first,
take
action
and
the
question
is
and
that
you
can
argue,
the
way
you
can
argue
as
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
in
estin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
perfectly
good
argument
for
you
to
make
but
it's
an
argument
and
not
what
estin
decided,
not
what
armstrong
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
little
thing
like
that,
whether
or
not
nevada
could
--
has
the
power
to
undue
a
valid
exercise
of
power
by
new
york
trial
thereto.
a
little
difference
like
that.
very
often
in
light
that
makes
a
difference
who
comes
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
understand
your
argument
there
but
don't
say
we
decided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
because
there
were
dissents,
the
case
stands
for
more
than
it
stood,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
pay
no
attention
to
my
dissent.
concentrate
on
what
the
court
decides.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
you
--
will
you
--
may
i
ask
you
how
you
get
what
a
court
decide
other
than
--
otherwise
than
to
the
--
through
the
court
statement
of
what
the
issue
is
which
it
is
about
to
decide.
let
me
read
you.
the
case
here
and
this
case
here
on
certiorari
present
an
important
question
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
it
is
--
it
is,
that's
the
question,
it
is
whether
a
new
york
decree
awarding
the
respondent
$180
per
month
for
maintenance
and
support
in
a
separation
proceeding
survived
a
nevada
divorce
decree
which
he
separate
--
subsequently
was
granted.
what
you're
arguing
is
that
those
words,
whether
it
survived
a
nevada
decree
subsequently
granted
were
supplant
which
is
immaterial,
redundant,
have
no
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose
when
this
court
states
what
the
issue
is
that's
the
issue,
not
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
cannot
do
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
get
any
use
of
your
time
that
you
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
directing
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
directing
counsel's
attention
to
the
fact
that
opinions
has
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
what
they
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
what
is
hoped
will
be
subsequent,
derivations
from
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
do
anything
you
please
with
your
time.
and
the
mere
fact
that
questions
are
asked
do
not
usually
extend
counsel's
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
it
--
why
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
time
when
the
divorce
was
granted
in
relation
to
the
passage
of
the
statute
have
anything
to
do
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
irrelevant
as
to
when
she
became
a
domiciliary,
except
for
the
time
period,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
confused
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
going
beyond
your
own
support
for
your
own
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
of
the
divorce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
if
later
on
the
state
says,
"there
are
so
many
ex-wives
in
our
state
who
are
at
large
and
we
now
enunciate
a
new
policy
that
all
ex-wives
may
bring
maintenance
proceedings
against
their
former
husband."
why
is
that
any
less
constitutional
than
this?
i
don't
see
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
a
question
of
whether
a
state
have,
as
justice
brennan
indicated
a
minute
ago,
a
state
may
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
affect
citizens
of
its
own,
domiciliaries
of
its
own,
may
provide
that
the
ex-husband
should
maintain
the
ex-wife.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
what
you
ultimately
have
to
rest
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
i
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
whether
that
preceded
a
divorce
of
that
policy,
preceded
a
divorce
or
follow
the
divorce,
as
far
as
i
can
see
about
constitutional
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
think
that
case
helps
you
any
because
that,
in
the
first
place
it
is,
(inaudible)
outmoded.
i
don't
believe
that
decision
would
hold
today.
that
was
the
last
remnant
of
recognizing
legislative
divorces.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
nice
way
of
simplifying
a
problem
in
a
unitary
state
but
it
isn't
that
way
with
us
where
we've
got
right
to
a
different
state
pulling
in
different
direction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
to
restate
what
you're
not
prepared
to
defend?
i
just
want
to
know
because
i
--
i'm
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
time
that
the
divorce
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
there
may
be
a
different
view.
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
to
play
--
the
fact
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
doesn't
come
into
play,
doesn't
ipso
facto
approve
that
a
state
can
impose
an
obligation
on
one
person
for
the
maintenance
of
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
therefore,
i
don't
see
that
one
follows
from
the
other
because
it
doesn't
have
to
--
because
the
full
faith
and
credit
--
because
that
divorce
judgement
doesn't
carry
with
it
an
adjudication
that
smith
need
not
support
mrs.
smith
thereafter.
from
that,
you
don't
jump
automatically
that
therefore
the
state
of
new
york
or
any
other
state
can
say
that
mr.
smith
must
support
mrs.
smith.
the
power
for
that
--
that
exercise
of
power
must
rest
on
something
else
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
merely
that
there
was
no
adjudication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

forget
all
about
misconduct.
the
whole
basis
of
judge
fuld's
opinion
on
which
you
are
relying
is
that
alimony
isn't
just
a
personal
obligation
like
a
man
suing
on
a
debt,
on
a
note.
the
view
of
judge
fuld
is
that
it
isn't
--
that
alimony
is
an
incident
to
the
status
and
thereby
do
not
see
how
you
can
escape.
in
fairly
answering
justice
black's
question
that
in
as
much
as
nevada
can
cutoff
alimony,
nevada
can
impose
alimony
in
favor
of
new
york
to
be
respected
in
other
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
talking
about
the
analysis
which
judge
fuld
made.
justice

can't
take
what
you
want
and
reject
what
you
don't
like.
