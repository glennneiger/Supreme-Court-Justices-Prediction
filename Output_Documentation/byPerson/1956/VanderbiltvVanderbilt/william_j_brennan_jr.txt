justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
have
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
suggesting
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
suggesting
that
she
swore
falsely,
has
that
been
the
determination
of
any
of
the
new
york
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
were
any
of
those
issues
before
the
new
york
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
were
all
decided
adversely
to
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
for
example
that
new
york
domiciliary
wives
who
--
as
to
whom
they
were
ex
parte
divorce
is
just
as
this
and
who
lived
in
the
state
of
new
york
before
new
york
recognized
post-divorce
maintenance
would
not
be
able
to
avail
themselves
of
this
statute
in
new
york
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
here,
mrs.
vanderbilt
acquired
a
new
york
domicile
when
this
statute
was
on
the
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
prior
to
the
enactment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
was
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
he'd
moved
out
to
nevada
a
month
earlier
and
had
obtained
his
divorce
a
week
or
two
before
this
new
york
statute
became
effective?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
don't
quite
understand
why
you
answered
justice
harlan
that
it
might
depend
in
the
new
mexico
case
that
should
been
a
domiciliary
of
new
mexico
on
new
mexico's
law
at
the
time
of
the
divorce.
what
difference
does
it
make
on
--
as
i
understand
your
argument,
basically
it
is
that
based
on
estin,
armstrong,
pennoyer
and
neff,
nevada
could
not
in
anywise
by
its
decree
affect
personal
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
in
a
given
state
where
she
was
a
domiciliary
at
the
time
they
don't
recognize
any
personal
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
agree
with
me.
i
--
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
could
it
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
i
don't
understand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
question,
how
could
it
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
were
also
arguing,
however,
that
the
nexus
under
this
statute
is
her
domicile
in
the
state
of
new
york?
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
nexus
with
new
york
by
reason
of
her
domicile
there
is
the
reason
that
new
york
may
give
her
the
relief
that
this
statute
provides.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
fact
then
--
then
i
don't
follow
you
why
anything
that
new
mexico
could
do
could
affect
that
basis
of
new
york
power.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
domiciliaries?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
difference
does
it
make?what,
as
a
domiciliary
of
new
mexico,
new
mexico
may
have
done
in
respect
of
not
recognizing
that
she
had
any
rights,
that
they
were
cut
off
so
long
as
she
was
a
new
mexico
domiciliary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
which
suggest
that,
isn't
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
statute
is
based
only,
as
i
understand
it,
upon
the
one
invoking
its
benefits,
establishing
domicile
in
new
york.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
requisite
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
your
refer
this
to
this
quote
at
547?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
didn't
get
quite
to
the
sentence
but
section
1170-b
to
the
extent
that
it
applies
has
changed
that
old
new
york
policy,
that
is
on
ex
parte
in
new
york
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
divorces.
is
that
what
you
say
is
a
holding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
let
me
ask
this
question.
is
that
a
holding
that
if
ever
there
was
a
new
york
law
which
gave
the
effect
to
ex
parte
divorces
that
your
adversary
insist
new
york
law
did,
this
is
a
holding
that
that
law
was
changed
by
1170-b?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
has
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
spoken
in
any
other
case
since
this
decision
on
this
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
winsten,
i
--
i
appreciate
that
it's
not
here
and
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
with
it,
but
do
you
proceed
in
the
other
important
aspect
of
divisible
divorce,
custody
of
children,
somewhat
the
same
problem
if
the
children
--
if
there
were
minor
children
non-residence
of
nevada
at
the
time
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
divorce
was
obtained
and
the
wife,
the
domiciliary
of
new
york
and
the
children
with
her
in
new
york
and
do
nevada
purported
to
make
as
part
of
its
decree
some
provision
for
custody
of
the
children
that
the
same
full
faith
and
credit
problem
may
arise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

patriae
factor
in
that
anyway,
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say
you
have
parens
patriae
involved
in
the
state
where
the
children
actually
are
