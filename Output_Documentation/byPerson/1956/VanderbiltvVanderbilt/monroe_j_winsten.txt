mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
rosenblatt
has
made
many
strong
assertions
which
i
do
not
believe
can
be
legally
sustained.
on
page
5
and
6
of
my
brief,
i
have
attempted
to
set
out
in
chronological
order
the
operative
facts
of
this
case.
your
honors
should
bear
in
mind
that
this
trial,
although
vigorously
defendant
was
not
attended
by
the
defendant.
he
chose
to
remain
absent
from
this
trial
for
many
significant
reasons
and
the
facts
in
this
case
are
either
established
by
uncontradicted
evidence
or
by
the
defendant's
admissions.
however,
in
many
instances,
certain
of
those
defendant's
admissions
were
inconsistent
and
contradictory.
that
is
the
only
contradiction
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
contradictions
made
by
the
defendant
himself
in
sworn
or
written
admissions.
now,
in
1945,
we
have
an
affidavit
sworn
to
by
the
defendant
that
he
was
domicile
in
california
since
1945.
he
made
this
affidavit
in
1953
--
or
1952.
so
that's
starting
with
1945,
the
defendant
is
a
california
domiciliary.
the
marriage
took
place
in
1948
in
connecticut.
mr.
rosenblatt's
claim
that
the
defendant
was
a
nevada
resident
stands
from
this
fact
only
that
in
his
marriage
certificate,
he
stated
his
residence
as
nevada
in
1952.
as
against
that
we
have
his
contradictory
statement
in
a
sworn
affidavit
to
the
new
york
court
in
1952.
i
should
say
that
that
statement
was
made
in
his
marriage
certificate
in
1948.
this
sworn
affidavit
in
1952
says,
however,
"i
have
been
a
domiciliary
of
california
since
1945."
perhaps
he
might
have
been
a
resident
of
nevada
prior
thereto
but
it's
not
an
operative
significant
fact
of
this
case.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it
would
not,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
at
all.
now,
after
this
marriage
the
parties
traveled
extensively
throughout
the
united
states
and
throughout
europe
and
came
to
reside
periodically
in
the
defendant's
mother's
mansion
on
5th
avenue.
there
was
an
apartment
set
aside
for
their
residence
when
they
came
to
new
york.
there
was
a
nexus
between
these
parties
in
new
york.
new
york
was
not
a
stranger
to
these
parties
nor
were
they
--
that
--
were
they
strangers
to
new
york.
during
their
married
life
these
parties
never
set
foot
together
in
the
state
of
nevada
and
i
want
to
get
that
clear
on
the
record.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it
does
not
make
a
difference.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
although,
mr.
rosenblatt
seems
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
to
think
it
does.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
all
right,
sir.
the
parties
continued
their
residence
and
became
domicile
in
california
at
the
time
the
separation
and
the
abandonment
took
place.
after
the
abandonment
took
place,
mrs.
vanderbilt
came
to
new
york.
now,
there
have
been
certain
statements
made
by
counsel
which
do
not
make
a
difference
and
i
want
to
point
them
out,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
the
legal
issue
as
raised
by
the
petitioner
here
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right,
sir.
although,
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
legal
issue
or
a
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
this
case.
but
i
can
--
i'll
state
to
your
honor
what
i
understand
to
be
the
legal
issue
claimed
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
believe
that
they
have
raised
frivolous
by
the
federal
questions
and
not
substantial
ones.
his
chief
contention
seems
to
be,
your
honor,
that
new
york
has
failed
to
accord
full
faith
and
credit
to
this
ex
parte
nevada
divorce
decree
based
on
constructive
service
in
which
the
wife
failed
to
appear,
answer
or
defend
and
although
whom
the
nevada
court
failed
to
acquire
any
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
there
is
no
full
faith
and
credit
question
involved
in
this
case
for
two
separate
and
distinct
reasons.
all
of
--
both
of
these
reasons
have
been
covered
by
the
three
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
armstrong
against
armstrong.
the
first
reason
and
then
the
principal
reason
rest
upon
pennoyer
against
neff
and
estin
against
estin,
based
upon
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
nevada
court's
rendition
of
that
ex
parte
divorce
decree.
nevada
did
not
have
any
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
wife
when
it
rendered
this
divorce
decree
against
her.
consequently,
when
new
york
accorded
recognition
to
the
nevada
decree,
insofar
as
it
dissolved
the
marital
status,
it
has
accorded
the
fullest
faith
and
credit
which
the
nevada
decree
was
entitled
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
don't
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
however,
counsel
has
raised
questions
of
discrimination.
he
has
raised
an
issue.
i
believe
it's
a
framed
issue
and
not
a
true
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
my
other
ground
is
this,
that
nevada
in
rendering
this
decree,
i
do
not
believe,
considered
or
decided
the
issue
of
maintenance
in
alimony
here.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
if
they
had,
then
i
might
fall
back
to
pennoyer
against
neff
and
estin
against
estin
because
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
it.
that's
why
at
the
outset
of
my
--
of
this
point
i
said
for
two
separate
and
distinct
reasons,
they
have
not
failed
to
accord
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
your
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
both
of
these
arguments
raised
--
rest
on
separate
and
distinct
grounds.
now,
in
support
of
my
last
statement
that
they
did
not
purport
to
decide
the
issue
of
maintenance,
defendant's
exhibit
a
is
the
complete
record
of
the
nevada
proceeding.
the
--
the
complaint
makes
no
reference
to
alimony.
the
testimony
contains
no
reference
to
alimony.
the
findings
contains
--
contained
no
reference
to
alimony
and
the
judgment
is
merely
couched
in
general
terms
that
the
marriage
is
dissolved
and
the
parties
are
relieved
from
further
obligations
with
respect
to
the
marriage.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
have
appended
to
my
--
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief
on
page
38,
the
section
of
the
nevada
law
referring
to
alimony.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
the
sweeney
case,
your
honor,
is
a
nevada
case.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
well,
as
against
the
sweeney
case,
your
honor,
this
is
my
analysis
and
of
my
--
and
my
interpretation
of
the
decree
in
the
record
in
this
nevada
case,
we
are
faced
with
the
statute
in
nevada
which
permits
the
grant
of
maintenance
notwithstanding
marital
fault.
in
other
words,
nevada
under
that
statute
may
grant
maintenance
to
a
wife
even
though
the
court
should
hold
that
she
was
a
guilty
and
not
an
innocent
party.
and
that
statute
contemplates
an
inquiry
by
the
court
into
the
financial
means
of
both
parties,
their
resources,
in
order
to
determine
whether
even
a
guilty
wife
may
be
awarded
maintenance.
now,
with
that
background,
with
that
statutory
background,
also
with
the
background
of
the
estin
case
and
pennoyer
against
neff,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
inquiry
by
the
nevada
court
into
the
financial
circumstances
and
bearing
in
mind
that
the
nevada
court
could
have
granted
alimony
to
a
guilty
wife,
i
believe
that
the
record
justifies
a
presumption
that
the
--
that
the
nevada
court
did
not
purport
to
disregard
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
estin
against
estin
with
respect
to
its
jurisdictional
power
to
determine
personal
rights
of
an
absentee
non-resident
spouse.
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
i
make
that
second
assertion,
if
your
honor
pleases,
with
the
background
of
that
nevada
statute.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
for
a
moment
to
this
first
separation
action,
which
counsel
has
mentioned,
merely
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
that
it
does
not
belong
in
this
case.
this
first
action
was
based
upon
--
it
was
an
action
for
separation
and
was
dismissed
upon
the
finding
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
satisfied
the
residential
requirements
for
the
maintenance
of
an
action
in
new
york,
therefore
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
well,
after
that
action
had
been
dismissed
and
while
an
abortive
appeal
was
pending
at
that
time,
the
defendant
went
to
nevada
and
commenced
this
divorce
action,
ex
parte
by
publication.
when
plaintiff
was
served
with
these
papers
in
new
york,
her
counsel
at
that
time
made
a
motion
in
that
action
which
had
been
dismissed
to
enjoin
the
prosecution
of
a
nevada
action.
that
motion
was
determined
on
july
3rd,
which
was
three
days
after
the
defendant
obtained
his
ex
parte
divorce
decree
in
nevada.
the
motion
was
therefore
denied
on
a
two-fold
ground.
first,
that
a
motion
for
an
injunction
could
not
be
granted
in
an
action
which
had
already
been
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
chief
problem.
however,
the
secondary
ground
was
that
the
nevada
action
having
already
proceeded
the
judgment,
an
action
to
enjoin
the
prosecution
of
that
action
was
moot
and
academic.
therefore,
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
case
have
--
even
being
mentioned
in
this
case.
it
has
absolutely
no
bearing
and
that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
with
respect
to
that.
now
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
nevada
court
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding
had
the
right
to
divest
an
absentee
non-resident
defendant
of
personal
rights,
then
this
court
would
have
had
to
hold
that
the
nevada
court
had
rendered
an
in
personam
judgment
against
this
wife,
divesting
her
of
her
personal
rights,
that
such
a
holding
would
be
directly
antithetical
to
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
estin
case.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
by
a
judgment,
your
honor?
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
is
your
honor
limiting
--
would
your
honor
limit
the
holding
in
the
estin
case
to
a
case
where
only
a
judgment
was
rendered?
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
as
i
read
the
estin
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
however,
the
rationale
of
the
estin
case
was
not
limited
to
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
the
fact
that
there
was
a
judgment
there.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
the
difference
between
the
estin
case
and
the
case
we
have
here
is
that
the
right
of
being
supported
by
the
husband
has
not
been
reduced
to
judgment,
wherein
the
estin
case
it
has
been.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
i
agree
with
your
honor.
however,
i
disagree
with
your
honor
when
your
honor
says
no
obligation
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
defined,
yes.
not
defined,
yes.
but
not
--
i
would
not
say
that
there
was
no
obligation
because
we
must
bear
this
in
mind,
your
honor,
this
woman
was
a
domiciliary
of
new
york
when
the
defendant
went
to
nevada
and
when
the
defendant
acquired
his
so-called
ex
parte
divorce
decree,
she
was
subject
to
the
laws,
entitled
to
the
benefits
and
protection
of
the
laws
of
new
york
as
a
domiciliary
of
new
york.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
naturally,
the
distinction
between
the
estin
case,
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
armstrong
opinion,
was
that
in
the
estin
case
she
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
acquired
a
judgment
before,
whereas
in
this
case,
the
defendant
won
his
race
for
judgment
by
departing
for
--
for
nevada
with
a
six-week
residential
requirement
where
she
was
domicile
in
new
york
with
a
one
year
residential
requirement.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
the
estin
case,
as
i
interpret
the
estin
case,
was
decided
upon
a
much
broader
base,
a
much
broader
rationale
than
the
narrow
fact
that
she
had
a
judgment.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
i
don't
think
it
made
a
difference
here,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
--
my
impression
of
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
mr.
justice
douglas'
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
and
i
believe
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
that
that
was
the
--
the
rationale
behind
the
case
because
otherwise,
we
wouldn't
be
using
pennoyer
against
neff
in
the
estin
case's
authority
on
the
question
of
the
power,
the
jurisdictional
power.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
there
was
a
dissent
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
your
honor,
and
by
mr.
--
by
mr.
justice
jackson.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
no,
your
honor's
dissent
was
based
upon
your
inability
to
discern
whether
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
discriminated
against
foreign
judgments.
that
was
your
honor's
dissent
in
that
case.
however,
i
do
not
believe
your
honor's
dissent
extended
it
--
extended
beyond
that.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
very
well,
sir.
now,
i
believe
i
am
justified
in
contending
that
in
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
estin
case
that
the
court
--
that
this
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
not
deciding
the
estin
case
upon
a
narrow
fact
of
the
--
that
she
had
obtained
a
judgment.
it
was
deciding
the
case
on
a
broader
basis
and
there
was
a
question
of
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
of
course
not.
i
do
not
make
that
contention,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
nevertheless.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
now,
the
balance
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
if
your
honor
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
way
i
have
read
the
balance
of
the
opinion
of
the
estin
case
indicates
to
me
as
my
belief
that
this
court
did
not
intend
to
interpret
the
situation
upon
the
narrow
base
of
a
prior
judgment
and
that
belief
is
strengthened
by
mr.
justice's
--
justice
black's
concurring
opinion
in
the
armstrong
case
where
he
said
just
that.
mr.
justice
black
in
his
opinion
in
the
armstrong
case
said
this
that
mrs.
estin's
right
reduced
to
judgment
was
no
greater
a
right
than
mrs.
armstrong's
right
unreduced
to
judgment,
and
they
were
both
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution,
that
no
state
could
divest
those
rights,
personal
rights.
one
reduced
to
judgment,
the
other
unreduced
to
judgment
without
due
process
of
law.
and
due
process
of
law
implies
jurisdiction
to
render
a
judgment
against
the
person
and
having
that
person
before
that
court
and
under
its
jurisdiction.
for
those
reasons
i
have
interpreted,
the
estin
case
to
me
what
i
said
i
did.
now,
going
to
the
next
question
of
discrimination,
that
question
is
brought
--
has
been
brought
into
this
case
and
i
believe
that
it
doesn't
belong
here.
we
are
not
required
to
grope
for
the
legislative
intent
in
this
case.
the
legislative
intent
in
this
case
is
furnished
by
the
report
of
the
law
revision
commission
and
when
the
law
revision
commission
proposed
this
legislation
with
respect
to
discrimination
it
said,
"in
order
to
avoid
discrimination,"
i
quote
that
on
page
25
of
my
brief,
"against
foreign
divorces,"
against
which
the
estin
opinion
won.
such
legislation
should
be
made
applicable
whether
the
husband's
ex
parte
adjudication
of
marital
status
was
obtained
in
a
foreign
court
or
a
new
york
court."
now,
i
don't
know
how
and
won't
clearly
nondiscrimination
could
have
been
expressed
on
that.
and
looking
at
the
statute
itself
which
is
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
4,
the
statute
does
not
delimit
the
ex
parte
judgment
to
those
rendered
in
foreign
jurisdictions.
it
talks
about
ex
parte
judgments
rendered
in
all
jurisdictions
including
new
york.
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
when
the
question
of
discrimination
was
raised
below,
reaffirmed
the
interpretation
and
the
intent
of
the
law
revision
commission
by
saying
that
it
did
not
interpret
this
statute
as
having
no
effect
on
new
york
judgments,
that
it
did
interpret
the
statute
as
having
equal
effect
on
new
york
judgments.
and
mr.
rosenblatt,
when
he
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
on
that
point,
started
to
read
at
a
point
subsequent
to
the
--
this
declaration
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
this
is
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said,
he
didn't
begin
on
page
546,
he
began
on
page
547.
and
on
--
in
546
of
the
record
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"as
to
defendant's
first
assumption
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
to
support
the
conclusion
that
it
is
inapplicable
where
the
prior
judgment
was
obtained
in
new
york."
well,
the
law
revision
commission
report
a
recommendation
certainly
makes
no
such
distinction
but
instead
recommends
applicability
whether
the
husband's
ex
parte
adjudication
of
marital
status
was
obtained
in
a
foreign
court
or
a
new
york
court,
page
468.
actually,
the
basis
for
this
assumption
by
defendant
is
an
idea
which
pervades
defendant's
whole
argument
and
that
is
whether
this
fundamental
and
unchangeable
law,
new
york
law,
that
an
already
divorced
wife
may
never
be
awarded
maintenance
by
a
new
york
court
and
that
an
action
for
separation
or
divorce
in
new
york
presupposes
an
existing
valid
marriage.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
if
my
client
became
a
domiciliary
of
florida
as
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it
would
not,
sir,
for
this
reason.
the
question
of
whether
a
state
may
--
will
or
will
not
entertain
an
action
is
a
matter
purely
of
state
power
it's
--
within
the
--
the
state's
share
of
interest
to
determine
whether
it
should
entertain
such
an
action.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
oh,
no,
sir.
she
must
be
domiciled
in
new
york
in
order
to
be
--
to
avail
herself
of
the
benefits
of
new
york
legislation.
a
state
doesn't
have
any
legitimate
interest
in
a
person
or
litigant
who
was
not
domiciled
within
the
state.
i
didn't
intend
to
preclude
the
question
of
domicile.
domicile
is
a
very
important
thing
and
she
became
domiciled
when
she
came
here.
her
domiciling
within
the
state
arouses
a
--
an
interest
of
a
state
in
its
domiciliaries
and
entitles
the
state
to
protect
those
domiciliaries
and
domicile
is
an
important
thing.
now,
if
this
woman
had
gone
to
florida
and
she
became
domiciled
in
florida
that
was
what
i
was
understood
your
question
to
mean.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
not
if
this
court
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
not
if
this
court
continues
in
its
refusal
to
examine
into
the
state's
power
with
respect
to
those
matrimonial
actions.
for
example,
here
we
have
new
york
with
a
none
--
one
year
residence,
we
have
nevada
with
a
six
--
with
a
six-week
residence,
we
have
florida
with
a
three-month
residence.
this
court
has
never
interfered
with
those
requirements
imposed
as
conditions
precedent
by
the
several
states
for
the
maintenance
of
actions.
now,
when
your
honor
reduces
it
to
20
days,
it's
a
question
of
degree.
would
this
court
be
motivated
into
interfering
with
such
a
state
statute
because
of
the
ridiculous
--
ridiculously
short
conditions
preceding
which
the
state
proscribes.
that
would
be
the
limitation
of
my
answer
to
that
question.
however,
if
this
court
felt
that
it
could
not
jurisdictionally
inquire
into
the
problems
of
the
state
to
reduce
to
a
ridiculous
situation,
the
domiciliary
requirements,
then
i
would
say
my
answer
would
be
the
same
if
it
was
five
days,
if
your
honor
pleases.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
there
is,
sir
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
absolutely
an
specific
finding
in
everyone
of
the
courts,
the
trial
court,
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals.
each
of
these
courts
had
so
found.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
your
question,
your
honor,
implies
a
state
of
facts
which
are
not
in
this
case.
however,
if
--
if
your
honor
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
your
honor
is
going
beyond
that
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
now,
the
point
is
this.
you
see
in
my
case
here,
we
have
this
wife,
a
resident
of
new
york
at
the
time
this
divorce
was
rendered
and
in
fact
before
this
defendant
went
to
nevada
to
establish
his
domicile,
you
are
now
giving
me
a
different
question.
you're
asking
me
whether
what
my
answer
would
be,
where
a
divorce
has
been
rendered
and
she
was
a
resident
of
say
new
mexico
and
then
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect
too
in
all
of
the
courts,
in
all
of
the
opinions
here.
now,
i
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
answer
your
honor's
question
where
we
--
i
must
assume
that
she
was
domicile
in
a
state
other
than
florida
when
her
--
when
the
nevada
case
was
decided
for
this
reason.
one
of
the
corollaries
of
the
estin
case
is
this
that
the
question
of
enforcement,
a
post-divorce
maintenance
is
a
question
of
state
policy
entirely.
now,
it
may
be
in
response
to
your
--
as
a
necessary
element
in
answer
to
your
--
your
honor's
question
that
she
may
have
been
domicile
in
a
state
which
didn't
recognize
post-divorce
maintenance.
let's
say
she
was
in
new
mexico
and
new
mexico
did
not
have
the
public
policy
that
new
york
has.
new
mexico
said
that
if
a
wife
is
divorced
that's
all
there
is
to
it,
there
is
no
survival.
we
will
not
enforce
any
post-marital
--
post-divorce,
rather,
maintenance.
under
those
circumstances
my
answer
to
your
honor's
question
would
have
to
be
no
that
she
couldn't
go
to
--
possibly
couldn't
go
to
florida
having
been
a
domiciliary
of
a
state
which
did
not
recognize
post-divorce
maintenance
when
the
divorce
was
--
was
obtained.
but
you
see
that
question
does
not
present
itself
here
because
she
was
a
resident
of
a
state
--
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
had
declared
its
public
policy
to
be
that
we
will
recognize
post-divorce
maintenance
where
the
maintenance
--
where
the
divorce
was
rendered
in
a
constructive
service
action.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
do
not
mean
that,
sir,
because
the
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
no,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
she
acquired
her
new
york
domicile
in
february
of
1953.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
this
statute
was
enacted
on
april
13th,
1953.
he
acquired
his
residence
in
between
in
nevada
in
march
of
1953.
he
went
to
nevada
in
march.
the
statute
was
enacted
in
april.
he
started
his
nevada
divorce
action
in
june
and
obtained
the
ex
parte
divorce
in
june.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that
was
the
sequence
of
events
there.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
then
we
would
have
a
question
of
conflict
of
laws
as
to
whether
or
not
the
applicable
law
in
existence
at
the
time
the
divorce
decree
is
rendered
would
fix
the
wife's
rights
at
that
particular
time.
however,
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
forces
here
because
on
the
one
hand
we're
dealing
with
jurisdictional
power,
the
jurisdictional
power
of
the
nevada
court
to
extend
its
judgment
beyond
its
borders
against
non-residents
and
adjudicate
upon
that
personal
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
it
makes
no
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
no,
i
agree
with
you
in
this
respect,
that
with
respect
to
jurisdictional
power
to
divest
a
personal
right
it
makes
no
difference,
but
possibly
it
might
make
a
difference,
i
don't
say
that
it
does,
it
might
possibly
make
a
difference
if
at
the
time
this
divorce
was
rendered
she
was
a
domiciliary
of
a
state
which
said
we
don't
recognize
any
survival
of
your
rights
to
be
supported
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
might
make
a
difference
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
because
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
because
as
a
question
of
conflict
with
laws,
possibly
she
was
a
resident
of
a
state
which
said
maintenance
does
not
survive
a
divorce
whether
rendered
in
personam
or
in
rem.
that
state
says
that
and
she
was
a
resident
of
that
state.
perhaps
she
might
go
to
another
state
thereafter
and
that
state
may
say,
"you
went
from
a
state
which
said
that
your
rights
were
extinguished
by
an
ex
parte
divorce."
i'm
not
talking
about
nevada
because
nevada
had
no
constitutional
power
to
extinguish
it.
i'm
only
talking
about
the
domiciliary
state
whether
that
state
recognize
its
survival
and
enforcement.
she
may
go
to
another
state
and
that
state
might
have
said,
"well,
you're
a
domicile
in
a
state
which
didn't
recognize
its
survival.
therefore,
we
will
not
enforce
it."
not
because
nevada
had
any
greater
power
to
extinguish
it,
but
because
the
state
in
which
she
was
domiciliary
didn't
--
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
didn't
recognize
its
survival.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
--
i
never
contended
otherwise,
if
your
honor
pleases.
in
new
york
we
have
a
definite
public
policy
recognizing
--
recognizing
post-divorce
maintenance,
survival
and
enforcement.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
of
a
domiciliary.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
situation
which
is
not
present
here.
it
might
possibly
--
new
york
might
possibly
say
in
that
case,
"you
were
domiciled
in
new
mexico
which
said
that
your
rights
were
extinguished
even
by
an
ex
parte
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
no,
sir,
absolutely
nothing.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
but
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
i
think
it's
to
our
advantage
that
it
did
happen
that
way.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it's
certainly
is,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
it
is.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it's
--
no,
there
is
a
point
that
i
must
disagree
with
your
honor
as
far
as
this
goes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
now,
i
say
this,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
that
time
element
is
wholly
irrelevant
because
of
what
i
said
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
said
perhaps
if
she
were
resident
of
a
state
which
had
a
public
policy
saying
that
we
will
not
recognize
post-divorce
maintenance.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
at
the
time
of
divorce,
that
might
make
a
difference.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
don't
see
it
either.
i'm
trying
to
agree
with
your
honor
in
principle.
i
do
not
disagree
with
it.
i'm
just
saying
that
possibly
that
may
be
an
argument
--
now,
i'm
not
prepared
to
sustain
that
argument
here.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that
is
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
precisely.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
but
i
am
not,
under
these
facts,
required
to
argue
that
point
or
extend
the
matter
to
that
extent.
however,
what
your
honor
says
is
quite
true
because
under
maynard
against
hill
in
125
u.s.,
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
person
--
when
two
parties
are
married
they
have
subjected
themselves
to
whatever
laws
the
state
may
enact
at
any
subsequent
time
which
may
alter
their
rights
and
obligations.
and
in
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
i
don't
--
i
didn't
indicate
it
for
the
purpose
of
a
legislative
divorce.
i
--
i
used
--
i
referred
to
that
case
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
what
the
parties
subject
themselves
to
by
entering
into
the
marital
relationship.
it
is
not
purely
a
contractual
relation.
it
is
a
relationship
to
which
the
status
of
party
and
on
--
in
that
relationship
the
state
may
subsequently
enact
a
legislation
which
may
alter
those
rights.
nobody
has
a
vested
right
to
legislation
or
his
marital
rights
and
obligations
that
exist
on
the
date
the
marriage
is
contracted.
it
may
be
altered
subsequently
by
the
state
in
trying
to
find
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
now,
on
the
question
of
discrimination
i
think
i
have
indicated
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
quite
clearly
indicated
that
it
construes
this
statute
to
be
non-discriminatory,
that
it
applies
with
equal
effect
to
new
york
judgments
as
well
as
those
rendered
in
foreign
and
its
sister
states.
and
i
think
that
interpretation
is
not
subject
to
review
by
this
court
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
does
accept
the
interpretation
of
state
statutes
as
placed
upon
it
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
--
in
which
it
was
enacted.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
no,
i
--
i
read
that
in
connection
--
the
part
that
i
did
read,
i
read
in
connection
with
the
point
of
discrimination.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
precisely,
your
honor.
you
see
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
argued
both
orally
and
in
his
brief
and
used
the
technique
which
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
estin
case.
in
order
to
attempt
to
demonstrate
the
impropriety
of
this
statue,
he
has
taken
all
the
new
york
authorities
and
placed
them
side
by
his
side
with
this
statute
and
said
they're
inconsistent
but
the
trouble
with
that
type
of
technique
is
this,
that
when
the
statute
is
enacted,
it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
to
change
preexisting
either
decisional
or
statutory
rules
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
newest
enactment.
now,
no
one
can
deny
that
the
new
york
legislature
may
change
a
rule
of
law
or
change
a
statutory
rule
by
the
enactment
of
a
legislation
which
doesn't
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
not
on
this
question,
your
honor.
it
has
passed
on
--
at
least
there
was
before
it
some
question
of
temporary
alimony
which
is
not
on
the
issue
here
and
i
don't
think
it
has
been
decided
yet.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
due
process
of
law.
now,
petitioner
has
argued
that
this
case
was
dismissed.
therefore,
there
was
nothing
left
for
this
court
to
decide
in
this
case.
that
is
not
quite
accurate.
the
complaint
in
this
case
contains
two
causes
of
action,
one
for
cruelty
and
one
for
abandonment.
and
as
for
three
types
of
relief
and
they
are
enumerated,
one,
a
separation
from
bed
and
board,
two,
support
and
maintenance,
three,
such
other
in
further
relief,
the
usual
equity
prayer.
petitioner
would
have
or
rather
criticizes
the
plaintiff
for
having
pleaded
and
prepared
a
complaint
in
strict
conformity
with
the
cardinal
principles
of
pleading.
and
there
are
two
principles
which
i
have
in
mind.
one
is
that
you
are
not
required
to
anticipate
a
defense
in
a
complaint
and
secondly,
you
are
not
required,
in
fact
you
are
prohibited
from
pleading
conclusions
of
law.
here
is
a
complaint
which
is
broad
enough
to
sustain
an
award
of
maintenance
with
a
separation
or
without
a
separation.
we
are
not
required
to
plead
any
reference
to
the
statute
or
for
that
matter
to
any
decision
under
which
this
complaint
may
be
drawn.
this
complaint
was
drawn
with
--
on
the
basis
of
affording
either
the
relief
of
a
separation
or
maintenance
and
it
was
broad
enough
to
sustain
either
type
of
relief,
so
that
when
the
trial
court
during
the
course
of
the
trial
had
determined
and
--
and
reached
the
point
where
it
had
determined
that
plaintiff
had
not
sustained
her
burden
of
demonstrating
the
lack
of
bona
fides
of
the
nevada
residence
of
the
defendant.
he
decided
that
the
divorce
--
the
nevada
decree
was
a
--
was
jurisdictionally
valid
and
constituted
a
bar
to
a
separation.
however,
in
making
that
ruling,
the
court
did
not
dismiss
the
complaint
in
its
entirety.
it
merely
denied
the
relief
of
a
separation
that
was
asked
in
the
first
prayer
of
the
complaint
and
if
there
is
any
question
about
it,
this
is
what
occurred.
after
the
trial
court
made
its
ruling
on
that
score,
i
desired
to
be
--
to
have
further
clarification
of
that
ruling
and
this
is
what
occurred
at
page
345
of
the
record
and
i'll
quote
it.
it's
quoted
on
page
32
of
my
brief
as
a
footnote.
mr.
winsten,
"that
it
is
my
understanding
from
your
honor's
ruling
that
the
complaint
is
not
dismissed
in
its
entirety."
the
court
has
merely
denied
the
relief
of
separation
but
it
is
entertaining
the
action
and
the
complaint
insofar
as
it
request
support
and
maintenance.
the
court,
"there's
any
question
about
it
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean."
"i
said
i
am
continuing
the
case
but
that
part
of
the
complaint
is
dismissed."
so
when
counsel
makes
the
statement
to
this
court
that
a
complaint
--
the
complaint
was
dismissed,
that
is
not
wholly
accurate.
the
complaint
--
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
would,
sir.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that
is
my
position.
that
as
a
domiciliary
of
new
york,
new
york
had
--
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
her
welfare?
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
when
you
say
the
right,
i
never
subscribed
to
the
fact
that
nevada
had
the
right
to
adjudicate
alimony
against
an
absentee,
nonresident
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
i
will
not
subscribe
entirely
to
your
honor's
statement
where
your
honor
says
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
had
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
in
this
respect,
your
honor.
when
you
said
that
nevada
in
--
including
in
your
assumption
that
nevada
had
the
constitutional
right
to
adjudicate
and
deny
alimony
to
an
absentee
defendant
over
whom
would
have
no
in
personam
jurisdiction.
if
you
make
that
assumption,
that
destroys
the
whole
concept
of
divisible
divorce
and
pennoyer
against
neff
because
it
is
all
based
upon
the
concept
of
pennoyer
against
neff
where
the
state
cannot
extend.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
believe
so.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
the
point
is
i'm
not
--
do
not
have
to
take
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
and
i
wouldn't
--
didn't
come
here
prepared
to
defend
such
an
extreme
position.
however,
it
may
be
possible
that
such
a
position
would
be
constitutionally
correct.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
am
not
prepared
--
i
am
not
prepared
to
sustain
a
position
where
a
divorce,
an
ex
parte
divorce
was
rendered
against
an
absentee
wife
who
was
domicile
in
a
state
whose
public
policy
was
that
it
did
not
recognize
survival
of
post-divorce
maintenance
whether
rendered
in
a
--
in
an
in
rem
or
an
in
personam
action.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
at
the
time
of
the
divorce.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i'm
not
prepared
to
maintain
that
but
that
is
not
the
case
here
because
it
is
all
based
upon
my
fundamental
principle
that
the
recognition
--
an
enforcement
of
post-divorce
maintenance
is
a
matter
of
state
policy.
it
is
not
a
federal
question.
and
so
long
as
it
does
not
conflict
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution,
each
state
may
for
itself
decide
what
its
policy
will
be.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
exactly.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
it
is
unnecessary
as
far
as
the
constitutional
question
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that
is
another
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
that
that
--
that
situation
was
presented
in
may
against
anderson,
decided
by
this
court
where
--
i
believe
it
was
wisconsin
that
an
ex
parte
divorce
decree
was
rendered
in
favor
of
a
husband,
awarding
custody
of
the
children
to
the
husband
where
they'll
--
the
wife
was
an
absentee
non-resident.
subsequently,
under
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
arose
in
ohio
brought
by
the
wife,
she
proceeded
to
request
custody
of
the
children
which
the
wisconsin
court
had
granted
to
the
husband
in
an
ex
parte
divorce
and
this
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
court
sustaining
the
writ
precisely
on
that
ground,
if
your
honor
pleases.
on
the
ground
that
the
wisconsin
--
on
one
of
the
grounds,
i
would
say,
that
the
wisconsin
court
did
not
have
a
power
ex
parte
to
divest
the
wife
of
one
of
those
elements,
in
one
of
those
placeable
attributes
of
the
merits.
however,
i
don't
use
may
against
anderson
as
a
complete
authority
because
custody
of
children
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
--
are
subject
to
a
constant
change
and
the
--
there
may
be
other
elements
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i
didn't
hear
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
that's
right.
and
of
course
circumstances
may
change
with
respect
to
the
parties
and
under
those
conditions,
an
adjudication
at
one
time
may
not
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
all
right,
sir.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
all
in
all,
the
basis
which
or
the
chief
contention
which
petitioner
--
sir?
the
chief
contention
which
the
petitioner
makes
in
--
in
this
case
involves
two
basic
inconsistencies
and
what
i
mean
at
least
two
basic
inconsistencies
and
one
is
this.
petitioner
contends
that
he
can
unilaterally
go
to
the
state
of
nevada
and
invoke
its
jurisdictional
processes
and
obtain
the
benefits
and
protection
of
the
laws
of
nevada
in
obtaining
his
quickie
divorce
against
a
defendant
based
on
constructive
service,
but
nevertheless
he
says,
this
wife
cannot
unilaterally
go
into
new
york,
establish
her
own
domicile,
if
you
please,
and
obtain
the
benefits
and
protection
of
the
laws
of
her
own
domicile,
the
domicile
of
her
own
choosing.
that
is
one
of
the
basic
inconsistencies
in
this
case.
he
says
that
he
can
go
from
california
to
nevada
and
get
a
perfectly
good
divorce
based
upon
a
unilateral
domicile,
but
she
cannot
go
from
california
to
new
york
and
obtain
and
invoke
the
protection
of
the
laws
of
new
york.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
well,
this
one
is
not
ex
parte
in
its
--
in
this
sense,
if
your
honor
pleases.
new
york
did
not
purport
to
make
an
in
personam
judgment
in
this
case.
new
york
exercised
its
power,
its
jurisdictional
power
upon
a
reach
that
was
sequestrated
by
the
receiver
here
within
its
boarders.
therefore,
even
though
in
a
sense
and
in
a
very
vague
sense
this
action
is
ex
parte,
this
record
shows
that
this
action
was
not
really
an
ex
parte
action.
there
are
some
500
pages
of
testimony
here
in
a
seven-day
trial
and
this
was
not
an
ex
parte
action
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it
to
be.
but
new
york
did
not
attempt
--
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
the
--
the
defendant
may
have
had
some
relationship
with
nevada
many
years
ago.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
that
aspect
that
your
honor
stated.
however,
he
went
to
california
and
concededly
established
the
domicile
in
california.
what
survives
of
his
previous
connection
with
nevada
at
that
point,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
anything
does.
therefore,
when
he
left
california
again
and
went
into
nevada,
he
was
a
new
resident
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
of
the
state
of
nevada,
so
that
when
he
left
california
to
go
there
he
was
--
he
had
the
status
of
any
other
person
who
came
to
nevada
for
the
first
time.
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
your
honor?
mr.
monroe
j.
winsten
i'm
sorry.
well
