mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
may
it
please
the
court.
when
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
now
famous
case
of
estin
against
estin,
the
last
sentence
in
that
prevailing
opinion
read
as
follows,
"and
it
will
be
time
enough
to
consider
the
effect
of
any
discrimination
shown
to
out
of
state
ex
parte
divorces
when
a
state
makes
that
its
policy."
i
don't
think
that
even
mr.
justice
douglas
had
the
faintest
idea
of
what
was
going
to
happen
to
the
legislative
policy
of
new
york
after
writing
that
opinion
in
estin
against
estin.
but
shortly
thereafter,
attempts
were
made
to
introduce
statutes
into
the
new
york
legislature.
and
finally,
one
was
passed
effective
april
1953.
the
court
has
been
supplied
with
the
pamphlet
of
the
law
revision
commission,
legislative
document
number
65
(k),
which
accompanied
the
proposed
statute,
which
is
now
for
consideration
before
this
court
in
view
of
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case
i
may
say.
and
in
that
pamphlet,
i'd
like
to
read
just
two
sentences
to
call
to
the
direct
attention
of
the
court,
the
background
before
i
recite
the
most
important
facts,
which
are
to
be
considered
by
the
court.

page

--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
--
you
mean
the
law
revision
commission?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
what's
that?
we
forwarded
all
the
copies
to
the
clerk.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
this
most
important
law
revision
commission,
document
number
65
(k)
with
the
(inaudible)
and
forward
them
to
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i'll
see
that
you
certainly
have
them
sir,
if
you
haven't
already
been
given.
at
page
5
of
this
recommendation
and
the
top
reads,
"recommendation
to
the
law
revision
commission
to
the
legislature
relating
to
the
jurisdiction
to
the
supreme
court,
that's
of
new
york,
to
grant
maintenance
to
a
wife
not
withstanding
a
judgment
of
divorce,
annulment
or
nullity
of
marriage
of
a
court
which
did
not
have
personal
jurisdiction
overheard."
and
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
commission
says,
"the
estin
case
called
the
attention
to
the
injustice
to
a
new
york
wife
whose
husband
has
obtained
the
divorce
in
another
state
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding."
and
thereafter,
immediately
before
the
recommendation
of
the
specific
statute,
which
will
be
found
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
--
i
think
4
or
5
--
page
4.
the
commission
says
the
following,
"the
commission
believes
that
legislation
is
necessary
to
protect
the
new
york
wife
who's
right
to
support
from
her
husband
may
now
be
completely
cut
off
by
an
ex
parte
foreign
divorce
decree
in
the
absence
of
a
previous
new
york
separation
decree
with
provision
for
maintenance.
in
order
to
avoid
discrimination
against
foreign
divorces,
against
which
the
estin
opinion
warned,
such
legislation
should
be
made
applicable
whether
the
husband's
ex
parte
adjudication
of
marital
status
was
obtained
in
a
foreign
court
or
a
new
york
court.
what
wonderful
language
and
i'll
proceed
to
take
it
apart,
because
as
applied
in
this
case
where
there
was
no
new
york
wife
and
there
was
no
new
york
husband,
my
contention
is
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
it
violates
particularly
article
4
section
2
of
the
constitution
and
is
in
complete
disagreement
with
every
concept,
when
i
was
taught
years
ago,
constituted
the
elements
of
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
i
can
make
that
clear
on
the
statement
of
facts.
in
1948,
a
fellow
named
vanderbilt
had
been
a
resident,
a
legal
resident,
a
domiciliary
of
the
state
of
nevada
since
1928.
that's
20
years
previously.
during
all
that
period
of
time,
that
was
his
domicile.
that
is
his
home.
and
in
1948
of
september,
the
lady
who
he
married
in
the
state
of
connecticut
was
admittedly
domiciled
herself
in
the
state
of
california.
so,
when
this
two
got
married
in
the
state
of
connecticut
in
september
of
1948,
they
continued
in
their
marital
relations.
sooner
or
later,
left
the
matrimonial
domicile
of
nevada
and
became
domiciliaries
of
the
state
of
california
where
they
voted,
where
they
paid
taxes,
in
the
state
of
california.
and
in
september
of
1952,
they
parted.
they
were
then
both
residents
of
the
state
of
california
in
september
1952.
but
this
lady,
in
an
action
which
is
very
important
for
the
court
to
understand
but
which
is
not
--
this
particular
action
but
between
these
two
parties,
this
lady
sat
in
los
angeles
and
verified
a
complaint
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county
where
she
cause
mr.
vanderbilt
to
be
served.
he
hadn't
just
gotten
off
a
boat
from
europe,
and
she
claimed
that
she
was
entitled
to
a
separation,
alimony,
counsel
fees,
and
she
swore
from
that
complaint
that
she
and
mr.
vanderbilt,
her
husband,
were
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york,
domiciliaries
of
new
york.
because
if
she
hadn't
said
that
they
were
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york,
she
couldn't
have
issued
any
process
to
have
him
served
in
the
state
of
new
york.
you
cannot
bring
a
matrimonial
action
of
any
kind,
nature
or
description
in
new
york
state
unless
there
is
a
specific
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
parties
are
legal
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
under
this
or
any
other
statute.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
you
bet,
your
honor,
because
this
one
calls
for
an
action
in
new
york
for
a
divorce,
separation
or
nullity
and
it
does
not
change
the
legal
requirement
that
in
any
of
this
process,
for
any
of
these
three
kinds
of
relief,
you
must
swear
that
you
are
a
resident
of
new
york.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
she
swore
that.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
jurisdictional
requirement.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
now,
that
first
case
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
sir?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
it
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
it
was
--
you're
anticipating
a
little
bit
but
i'd
like
to
answer
your
question
now
so
you'll
understand.
it
was
passed
on
by
the
appellate
division
with
the
presiding
justice
dissenting.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
know.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well,
may
it
please
your
honor,
thank
god
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
all
the
difference
in
the
world
so
far
as
the
question
is
for
review
in
this
court,
because
it
will
take
more
than
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
two
justices
dissenting
to
convince
this
court
in
my
opinion
that
due
process
was
properly
given
under
this
statute.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
all
right,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
new
york
courts
in
this
case
--
the
new
york
courts
in
this
case
passed
the
question
but
i'll
tell
you
why
for
a
very
technical
reason
when
i
get
my
recital
of
facts.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
right.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
right,
but
i
haven't
explained
yet
what
the
full
requirement
of
new
york
is.
because
the
full
requirement
is,
that
if
you
were
to
found
any
matrimonial
action
and
if
you
have
not
been
a
resident
of
new
york,
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant,
ex
parte
or
with
appearances,
nevertheless,
it
has
to
be
a
years
full
residence
and
domicile
before
you
can
start
any
action.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
may
it
please
the
court.
i
noted
yesterday
that
the
report
of
the
law
revision
commission
which
had
not
then
been
--
been
supplied
to
your
honors
was
to
be
forthcoming
thereafter,
i
believe
it
is.
and
i
want
to
call
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
in
this
report
of
the
law
revision
commission
recommending
the
legislation
which
i
say
is
unconstitutionally
applied
against
my
client
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
won't
find
one
word
as
to
the
effect
of
a
new
york
ex
parte
decree
being
affected
by
this
proposed
legislation.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
court
of
appeals,
sir,
if
i
may
interrupt
my
recital
of
facts
but
your
honor
was
entitled
to
the
answer
at
page
547
of
this
record
said
as
follows,
"we
can
go
further
however
and
declare
that
even
if
section
1170-b
was
unavailable
as
against
the
new
york
divorce,
that
circumstance
would
not
mean
that
the
new
york
judgment
was
getting
more
than
the
nevada
judgment
less
faith
and
credit
in
new
york."
and
i
would
rest
my
entire
case
on
full
faith
and
credit,
sir,
in
this
court
on
the
following
statement
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
is
inaptly
--
and
inaptly
applied
here,
says
the
court,
"nevada's
judgments
put
in
evidence
in
new
york
are
entitled
to
the
same
effect
as
they
are
given
in
nevada."
and
to
avoid
unconstitutional
discrimination,
united
states
constitution
article
iv
section
2,
the
same
effect
new
york's
own
similar
judgments
are
given
in
new
york.
the
court
then
goes
on
and
says,
"but
under
the
divisible
divorce
doctrine,
defendants
nevada
divorce
had
no
effect
anymore
than
it
said
anything
in
terms
as
the
plaintiff's
property
rights.
its
sole
effect
was
to
end
the
marriage
and
it
is
been
given
that
effect
in
new
york."
may
it
please
this
court,
that
is
not
so.
a
nevada
decree
ex
parte
entered
in
nevada
forecloses
a
further
duty
of
support
to
the
wife
guilty
of
misconduct
under
the
laws
of
nevada
and
in
new
york,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
same
law
and
the
same
rule
applies
as
it
does
also
in
the
state
of
california
which
was
the
law
of
the
matrimonial
domicile
of
these
parties
at
the
time
of
their
separation.
what
the
new
york
court
has
done
is
to
give
partial
effect
to
the
nevada
decree
as
applied
in
new
york
as
against
its
own
decree.
now,
if
i
may
interject
because
i
want
to
pursue
this
a
little
later
if
i
may
with
your
honors
permission,
i
would
like
to
give
you
the
facts
of
this
case
so
that
you
may
judge
for
yourselves
whether
or
not
in
spite
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
determination
as
under
its
own
state
law
whether
or
not
full
faith
and
credit
and
the
privileges
and
immunity
of
this
man,
who
happen
to
have
been
a
20-year
permanent
domiciliary
of
the
state
of
nevada,
were
impinged
by
the
action
of
the
new
york
court.
you
see,
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
very
outset
a
new
york
judgment,
once
it's
rendered
is
conclusive
until
it's
set
aside.
it
may
not
then
be
modified
thereafter
for
some
future
equity
apparently
arising.
that's
the
herpe
case
in
225
new
york.
a
new
york
judgment
ex
parte
or
with
appearances
cuts
off
and
forecloses
all
rights
to
a
wife
guilty
of
misconduct
under
the
law
of
new
york.
and
there
isn't
a
new
york
lawyer,
including
myself,
who
would
dare
after
an
ex
parte
decree
had
been
rendered
against
the
woman
in
new
york,
who
would
dare
i
say
to
file
in
a
new
york
supreme
court
an
action
for
separation,
divorce,
or
annulment
with
that
ex
parte
decree
outstanding.
because
first
of
all,
the
woman
would
be
guilty
of
perjury
when
she
swore
that
she
was
married
and
she
has
to
swear
that
when
she
bring
such
an
action.
and
second,
the
statutory
provisions
requiring
that
that
judgment
is
conclusive
as
to
everything
which
it
determines
until
it
sets
aside
would
prevent
the
filing
of
that
kind
of
an
action
under
1170-b.
you
just
couldn't
file
this
kind
of
a
case
if
new
york
had
made
an
ex
parte
decree
theretofore.
it's
impossible.
and
a
lawyer
practicing
before
the
bar
in
new
york
would
have
to
advice
his
client
that
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
go
in
and
set
aside
that
decree
if
it's
possible
to
set
it
aside.
that
couldn't
be
done
if
it
was
already
been
outstanding
for
two
years
on
any
ground.
now,
what
happened
here?
and
in
a
sense,
this
is
an
ex
parte
action,
too,
in
new
york.
this
very
case
which
you're
called
upon
to
determine
because
after
the
first
case
was
instituted
by
mrs.
vanderbilt,
and
nobody
yet
has
ever
discovered
the
reason
why
with
a
matrimonial
domicile
in
california,
with
assets
and
property
in
california,
why
she
tried
to
commence
an
action
in
new
york
and
falsely
swear
that
both
of
them
were
residents,
nobody
yet
has
been
able
to
discover
that.
she
had
plenty
of
recourse
right
in
the
state
of
california
where
she
was
located,
but
she
started
an
action
in
new
york
and
it
took
us
months
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
testimony
and
hundreds
of
exhibits
to
get
that
action
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
neither
of
these
parties
had
ever
been
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
that
was
done
in
february
of
1953.
but
her
appeal
was
pending
until
february
of
1954.
she
says
that
in
february
of
1953,
she
came
from
california
to
new
york
and
that
she
then
took
domicile.
i
don't
know.
however,
let's
take
her
statement
that
she
took
domicile
on
february
1953.
she
had
no
right
when
she
came
to
new
york.
she
had
not
been
a
resident
as
required
by
the
new
york
statute
and
she
could
have
no
rights
as
a
wife
until
one
year
of
matrimonial
residence
had
ended.
that's
the
law.
i
didn't
make
it.
but
no
woman
can
sue
in
a
matrimonial
action
in
new
york
unless
she's
had
one
year
of
residence
which
is
interpreted
to
mean
domicile.
so
in
february
of
1953
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
sir.
i
didn't
cite
them
here
but
so
well-known
we'll
be
glad
to
furnish
the
authorities
if
you
like.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
would
you
like
the
authorities,
sir?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
we'll
be
delighted
to
send
them.
what
happened
was
that
in
april
of
1953
--
now,
her
case
for
separation
had
been
dismissed
in
february
1953
and
she
taken
an
appeal.
in
april
1953,
this
statute
became
law,
this
1170-b,
april
1953.
in
the
mean
time,
mr.
vanderbilt
in
march
had
gone
back
to
his
old
domicile
of
nevada.
and
by
the
way,
all
the
courts
have
found
that
his
domicile
there
was
legitimate,
had
been
consistently
maintain
and
that
when
he
returned,
it
was
proper
return
to
his
former
domicile
and
he
still
domiciled
there
and
all
the
courts
have
so
held
in
their
determinations.
nothing
happened
until
a
suit
was
commenced
for
divorce
by
mr.
vanderbilt
in
nevada,
in
june,
and
he
served
the
papers
on
mrs.
vanderbilt
in
new
york
city.
and
she
promptly
went
into
that
other
action
which
was
pending
and
she
made
a
motion
to
stop
this
divorce.
that
motion
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county
and
mr.
vanderbilt
received
the
divorce
june
30,
1953.
now,
nothing
happened
thereafter
until
april
of
1954
and
that's
the
inception
of
this
case.
in
april
of
1954,
mrs.
vanderbilt
in
new
york
brings
a
simple
action
for
separation.
it
says
on
the
summons
which
is
required
to
be
stated
in
the
new
york
practice,
action
for
separation.
it
doesn't
say
action
for
maintenance
in
case
the
separation
is
denied,
it
says
action
for
separation.
and
in
her
complaint
she
swears
that
she's
married
and
that
this
man
is
guilty
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
that
she
ask
for
support
under
the
separation
law
of
new
york.
and
at
the
same
time,
she
sequestrates
the
property
which
mr.
vanderbilt
had
then
come
in
due
--
due
to
the
death
of
his
mother
which
were
trusts,
inalienable
trust
long
established
in
new
york.
he'd
never
brought
them
there,
they
just
existed
in
new
york
and
she
seized
and
attached
all
those
trust
and
their
--
and
the
property,
that's
why
you
have
a
sequestrator
in
here
because
he's
still
in
this
case.
she
couldn't
have
sequestered
a
new
york
citizen's
property.
she
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
the
writ
because
new
york
resident
would
have
been
amenable
to
any
jurisdiction
of
the
new
york
court
by
service
even
outside
in
the
state
of
new
york
just
as
a
california
citizen
is
amenable
to
california
process
by
being
served
outside
the
state
of
california.
and
she
couldn't
have
commenced
this
action
under
1170-b
against
her
new
york
husband
without
saying
that
she'd
been
divorced
by
a
decree
of
new
york.
so
she
couldn't
have
sequestrated
under
any
circumstances
and
actually
if
her
papers
had
told
the
truth
on
the
sequestration,
if
she'd
said
that
she'd
been
divorced
but
the
divorce
was
no
good,
she
couldn't
sequestrate.
if
she
said
that
she
was
seeking
relief
under
1170-b,
she
still
couldn't
sequestrate
until
the
court
might
decide
in
her
favor.
but
she
got
a
sequestration
tied
up
everything
at
this
man
and
has
lived
very
well
ever
since
including
lawyers
and
bills
and
charges
and
everything
else
out
of
his
sequestrated
funds
which
maybe
is
the
right
thing.
i
don't
know.
that's
possible
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
right
thing
when
it's
founded
upon
a
process
rounded
in
iniquity,
rounded
in
perjury.
she
has
to
swear
falsely
to
bring
this
suit
and
she
has
to
swear
falsely
to
get
the
sequestration.
and
then
she
has
to
swear
falsely
when
she
says
that
she's
suing
for
separation
or
she's
not
suing
for
anything
of
the
kind.
she's
suing
for
what
we
call
maintenance.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
new
york
doesn't
have
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
a
maintenance
statute.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
no,
sir.
it's
not
the
determination
of
any
of
the
prevailing
opinions.
i'm
making
the
statement
because
as
you
remember
i
said
yesterday
that
i
want
you
to
hear
the
facts,
and
the
fact
is
that
when
she
swore
that
she
was
married,
she
wasn't
married
and
the
fact
is
that
when
she
swore
she
wanted
a
separation,
she
couldn't
get
one.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
certainly,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
by
the
majorities
of
the
courts,
yes,
but
thank
god
for
this
court
because
the
fact
that
new
york
decides
anything,
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
constitutionally
correct,
new
york
has
decided
plenty
of
cases
reversed
by
this
course
--
this
court,
thank
the
lord.
and
if
some
new
jersey
man,
for
example,
who
in
a
new
jersey
case
was
successful
in
thwarting
new
york
jurisdiction
when
new
york
wanted
to
take
jurisdiction
over
a
new
jersey
matter
in
a
matrimonial
case
when
the
new
york
court
said
in
pollock
against
pollock,
we
won't
make
this
a
mecca
for
foreign
divorces.
and
in
the
case
of
the
floyd
against
floyd
in
95
new
jersey
equity,
your
own
state,
sir,
said,
"but
to
entertain
a
suit
of
the
character
is
here
where
non-residence
were
involved,
that
one
claim
to
have
become
a
resident
after
an
ex
parte
decree
but
to
entertain
a
suit
of
the
character
is
here
would
have
a
pernicious
tendency
to
convert
this
state
into
a
mecca
for
disgruntled
divorces
and
just
threw
the
case
out."
you
see
in
new
jersey
after
the
estin
case
in
1950,
they
passed
a
special
statute
for
maintenance.
that's
what
they
did.
new
york
has
been
dishonest.
new
york
hasn't
passed
a
statute
for
maintenance.
new
york
says,
"come
hither,
stay
here
a
year,
sue
for
a
divorce
or
a
separation
which
you
can't
get,
then
we'll
give
you
maintenance."
and
the
man
will
stay
subject
to
those
orders
for
the
rest
of
his
life
because
this
same
section
says
that
the
court
by
order
at
anytime
thereafter
upon
the
application
of
either
party
to
be
given
in
such
manner
as
the
court
shall
direct
may
annul,
vary
or
modify
the
judgment.
now,
after
this
suit
was
commenced
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that
--
this
statute,
never.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that
statute
providing
from
maintenance?
certainly.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
right.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
provided
--
it
would
have
been
all
right
provided
that
new
york
had
had
some
interest
in
this
marriage.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
provided
that
at
some
time
the
matrimonial
domicile
of
either
one
of
these
two
parties
had
been
there
at
the
time
that
the
divorce
was
rendered.
yes,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
it
wouldn't
have
been
all
right
to
two
strangers?
no,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
it.
well
now,
may
i
pursue
that
a
second
with
you,
sir?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
think
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
no,
just
use
common
sense,
sir
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
that
sometimes
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that
sometimes
a
good
substitute
for
what
might
be
proper
law
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
and
i
will
put
it
to
you
as
follows.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
not
any
more
than
the
whole
system
of
saying
that
a
man
has
had
a
fair
trial
in
any
one
of
the
48
states
is
still
reviewable
in
this
court.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
think
so.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
i
base
it
on
the
following
fact,
that
at
the
time
that
the
divorce
was
rendered,
this
woman
had
no
matrimonial
domicile
in
new
york
at
all.
she
had
no
rights
under
any
new
york
statute
whatsoever.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
that
after
she
was
divorced
--
sir?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
certainly
it
is.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying,
and
i'm
also
saying
that
this
--
what
you
said,
your
honor,
in
your
dissent
in
the
estin
case.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
it
has
also
been
the
fact,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
i
was
taught
at
my
law
school
that
many
of
the
dissents
of
this
court
have
later
become
the
majority
opinion.
now,
you
said
in
the
estin
case,
sir,
"i
cannot
agree
that
new
york's
interest
in
its
residents
would
justify
new
york
in
giving
less
effect
to
an
enforceable
nevada
divorce
granted
to
one
domiciled
in
nevada
against
a
spouse
not
personally
served,
that
it
would
give
to
a
valid
new
york
divorce
similarly
obtained."
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
i'm
standing
on
that
in
this
court.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i'm
saying
that
new
york
has
treated
this
one
differently.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
i'm
basing
it
--
i'm
basing
it
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
no,
i
don't
have
to
even
consider
the
facts
found
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i
say
that
when
a
person
brings
an
action
under
the
new
york
law
and
labels
that
action
for
a
separation
and
it
isn't
an
action
for
a
separation,
i
say
that
i'm
entitled
under
coe
against
armour,
determined
by
this
court,
that
my
non-resident
client
who
has
never
appeared
in
this
case,
whose
special
appearance
is
still
preserved
to
it
including
this
court,
that
he
can't
be
held
for
something
which
isn't
a
separation.
i
say
that
due
process
requires
that
when
you
serve
a
paper
on
a
non-resident,
assuming
everything
that
the
new
york
court
held,
i
say
that
when
you
serve
the
paper,
the
man
has
got
a
right
to
know
what
to
meet
and
expect.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
and
he
had
a
right
to
expect
the
separation
case.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
among
other
things
--
among
other
things,
yes,
sir,
among
other
things.
i'm
resting
on
all
of
the
things
that
i've
brought
to
this
court's
attention
in
seeking
this
writ
and
which
this
court
granted.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i'm
trying
to,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well
now,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
take
a
look
further
into
the
record
in
reciting
the
facts.
having
put
into
special
appearance
and
entering
into
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
motion
was
made
for
a
separate
trial
as
to
the
validity
of
this
nevada
decree
in
new
york.
the
court,
however,
said
it
wouldn't
take
up
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
nevada
decree
which
had
never
been
mentioned
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
but
it
said
and
i'm
reading
at
page
39
of
the
record.
and
i
said,
rather,
"what
your
honor
is
doing
then
is
at
the
same
time
that
you're
going
to
take
testimony
on
whether
or
not
the
decree
is
valid.
you
are
going
also
to
take
testimony
on
the
very
issue
that
was
decided
by
that
decree
so
that
if
the
decree
is
valid,
all
this
testimony
has
to
be
stricken
out."
the
court,"
i
will
do
that.
we
can
do
that."
"mr.
rosenblatt,
don't
you
think
that's
a
little
prejudicial
to
this
defendant,
your
honor?"
the
court,
"what
prejudice
can
he
suffer?
if
he
is
successful,
he
has
suffered
nothing.
if
he's
not
successful,
we
have
tried
the
entire
case."
now,
this
case
of
the
plaintiffs
was
put
in
and
after
motions
to
dismiss
they
asked
them
for
the
right
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
the
nevada
decree,
there
was
no
evidence
other
than
that
characterized
by
the
appellate
division
as
meager
against
this
nevada
decree.
and
so
the
court
made
its
decision
and
it
said
at
page
344
or
rather
i
--
i
want
to
revert
just
before
the
decision
of
the
court
to
what
happened
because
all
these
courts
have
taken
the
position,
the
supreme
court,
appellate
division,
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
all
taken
the
position
that
there's
nothing
against
the
statements
of
this
plaintiff
on
the
question
of
any
misconduct.
the
court
said
at
page
342,
"in
the
event
that
i
do
not
rule
in
favor
of
the
defendant
on
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
nevada
decree
and
on
the
question
of
the
domicile
of
the
defendant
in
nevada
at
that
time,
then
of
course
if
you
have
any
evidence
to
offer
in
connection
with
your
defense
to
the
action
of
separation
based
on
cruel
and
inhuman
treatment
and
nonsupport,
at
that
time
you
may
be
free
to
offer
whatever
evidence
you
may
want
to
in
connection
with
that
particular
phase
of
the
case."
so
then
the
motion
was
determined
and
the
court
holds
at
page
348
and
as
recited
right
in
the
judgment
which
is
appealed
from
--
rather
page
344,
bottom
paragraph.
the
first
affirmative
defense
of
the
defendant
therefore
is
a
bar
to
the
plaintiff's
action
for
a
separation.
and
being
sustained,
the
complaint
bearing
on
this
issue
must
be
dismissed
upon
the
merits.
now
then,
we
have
a
dismissal
on
the
merits.
the
court
then
proceeds
to
take
evidence
in
spite
of
the
dismissal
on
the
merits,
the
separation
case
is
over.
so
the
--
the
judge
then
does
not
hear
any
new
testimony
except
on
the
income
and
the
desire
--
income
of
the
defendant
and
the
desires
of
the
plaintiff.
we
say
that
that
has
been
a
deprival
of
due
process
to
us.
we
were
called
in
to
meet
a
separation
case.
we
succeeded
in
having
it
dismissed
on
the
merits.
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
means
that
we
don't
have
to
go
on
but
then
the
court
went
ahead,
listened
to
what
the
plaintiff
said
that
she
needed
$3500
a
month
or
something
and
awards
her
$250
a
week
et
cetera,
et
cetera
since
the
commencement
of
the
action.
that
couldn't
happen
to
a
new
york
man
either
because
if
you
take
a
separation
case
in
new
york
and
you
win
the
separation
case
against
the
woman,
she's
entitled
to
nothing.
but
if
you
plead
1770-b
and
win
your
case,
she's
entitled
to
maintenance,
very
interesting.
it
couldn't
happen
to
a
new
york
citizen
under
any
circumstances.
i
would
like
to
withhold
the
balance
of
my
time
until
the
rebuttal
with
the
court's
permission.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
by
the
way
when
this
present
action
was
instituted,
the
papers
was
served
on
the
defendant
in
nevada
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
the
findings
below
as
to
the
defendant's
good
faith
domiciled
in
nevada.
i
quote
from
the
record
at
page
542.
"that
proof
included
a
showing
that
nevada
--
defendant
had
lived
in
voted
known
property
in
nevada
for
many
years
before
his
marriage
to
plaintiff
that
plaintiff
and
defendant
lived
there
together
in
the
early
months
of
their
marriage.
that
defendant
returned
there
some
months
before
the
divorce
and
that
defendant
has
continuously
maintained
his
residence
in
nevada
since
the
divorce."
may
it
please
the
court,
i
say
that
this
was
an
ex
parte
decree
rendered
by
new
york
because
our
rights
were
preserved
in
our
answer
by
special
permission
of
the
new
york
court
to
continue
our
objections
to
both
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
personam
and
in
rem.
secondly,
we
have
never
appeared
in
personam
in
new
york
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
addition
to
confiscation
of
whatever
assets
he
has,
which
will
forever
be
under
the
egest
of
this
sequestrator,
might
very
well
be
put
in
jail
at
some
point
under
the
new
york
penal
laws
for
contempt.
i
would
like
to
say
that
whether
the
decree
was
rendered
in
nevada,
alabama,
new
jersey
or
any
of
the
states
requiring
different
periods
of
residents,
my
basic
contention
in
this
case
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
point
is
that
that
decree
whether
its
nevada,
alabama,
california,
which
was
the
domicile
of
these
parties
when
they
were
separated,
should
be
given
the
same
full
force
and
effect
in
new
york
as
a
new
york
ex
parte
decree.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
very
interesting
question
which
i
opposed
in
the
appellate
division
to
my
opponent
because
since
the
decree
was
rendered
in
nevada
less
than
the
period
required
for
the
plaintiff
to
have
a
residence
requirement
fulfilled
in
new
york.
in
other
words,
she'd
been
there
a
little
over
three
months
and
it
took
one
year
before
her
rights
ripened
into
bringing
an
action,
you
can't
sue
for
divorce
in
new
jersey
until
you've
observed
the
residential
requirements
for
a
number
of
years
or
in
alabama
or
any
other
state
of
the
united
states.
so
in
new
york
it
requires
one
year.
this
lady
having
taken
residence
in
new
york
had
no
rights
under
the
new
york
statute
until
one
year
had
passed.
in
the
meantime,
she'd
been
divorced.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
when
i
asked
the
question,
what
would
happen
in
the
appellate
division?
what
would
happen
if
there
were
a
new
york
decree
and
that
decree
have
become
final,
could
the
lady,
fleeing
from
new
york
to
another
jurisdiction,
return
to
new
york
thereafter
at
some
future
time
and
then
commence
the
proceeding
for
a
divorce,
swearing
that
she
was
married
and
asking
for
maintenance
in
new
york,
my
friend
gave
the
same
answer,
there
he
said
they
could.
a
new
york
man
--
new
york
woman
could
do
that.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
mr.
justice
peck
in
the
appellate
division,
presiding
judge
of
the
court
said
at
page
540,
"i
am
unable
to
see
how
section
1170-b
would
be
made
applicable
to
cases
where
the
divorce
was
granted
at
the
state
of
new
york."
if
it
is
not
so
applicable,
it
is
discriminatory
and
violative
of
the
constitutional
provision
respecting
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
so
then
i
must
then
meet
the
question
from
the
bench
with
respect
to
new
york's
finding
at
page
546
and
547
brought
out
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
sentence
but
section
1170-b
to
the
extent
that
it
applies
as
change
that
old
new
york
policy
and
i
said
at
the
very
outset
of
my
argument
if
your
honor
will
recall.
i
said,
"i
would
stand
on
the
question
of
full
faith
and
credit
in
this
case
on
the
statement
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
following
that
statement
that
nevada's
judgments
put
in
evidence
in
new
york
are
entitled
to
the
same
effect
as
they
are
given
in
nevada
and
to
avoid
unconstitutional
discrimination,
the
same
effect
new
york's
own
similar
judgments
are
given
in
new
york."
but
i'm
not
here
only
on
the
question
of
how
little
faith
and
credit
has
been
given
to
this
nevada
decree,
but
i'm
here
on
the
question
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
different
states.
i'm
asking
this
court
to
observe
the
admonition
which
was
given
to
me
years
ago
by
a
very
famous
law
professor
named
zechariah
chafee,
now
deceased,
when
he
said
that
equity
follows
the
law.
i
think
that's
still
good
and
i
see
no
reason
why,
as
applied
in
this
case,
equity
should
be
made
to
follow
the
woman
instead
of
the
law.
and
that's
what's
been
happening.
your
honors
have
said
again
and
again
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
armstrong
case,
made
the
statement
that
the
right
of
support
is
a
property
right.
that
doesn't
happen
to
be
so
under
the
law
of
new
york.
there
is
no
such
property
right
until
it's
vest
by
determination
of
a
court
any
more
that
there's
any
right
in
a
divorced
woman
to
take
an
interest
in
their
husbands
estate
which
is
given
by
new
york
law
or
for
a
divorced
woman,
divorced
for
cause
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
enjoy
dower
which
is
an
inchoate
right
also
arising
from
the
marital
relationship.
these
inchoate
rights
must
flower
in
the
property
rights
by
decree
of
the
courts.
they
cannot
be
established
by
a
legislative
action
without
a
court
then
observing
their
basis.
here,
by
dismissing
this
complaint
and
the
judgment
appealed
from
said
so,
says
that
this
is
an
act
of
a
separation
and
the
complaint
is
dismissed
on
the
merits.
page
3
of
the
record,
what
it
says,
"by
dismissing
this
action
for
a
separation
and
then
going
on
to
give
maintenance
is
something
that
while
intended
perhaps
well
has
been
improperly
and
unconscionably
brought
about
against
this
defendant
in
this
case."
and
i
say
that
if
you
will
study
not
only
the
prevailing
but
also
the
dissenting
opinions,
you
will
find
that
the
interest
which
you
found
in
the
estin
prevailing
opinion,
where
new
york
had
an
interest
in
this
estin
woman
and
as
observed
by
my
friend
that
new
york
has
an
interest
in
mrs.
vanderbilt.
you
will
find
at
page
553,
the
very
wise
and
sage
observation
of
one
of
our
great
judges
in
new
york,
judge
fuld,
who
says
that
even
in
this
case,
only
by
confining
the
statute
to
the
situation
where
the
wife
had
standing
to
institute
the
matrimonial
action
in
this
state
at
the
time
that
the
foreign
divorce
was
granted,
may
new
york's
dealings
with
such
a
broken
marriage
be
restricted
"to
the
matters
of
her
dominant
concern,"
citing
estin
versus
estin,
and
unseemly
conflicts
between
this
state
and
other
jurisdictions
avoidable.
i
think
that
your
honors
must
understand
clearly
as
what's
said
by
judge
fuld
at
page
552,
the
bottom,
at
the
time
the
nevada
judgment
of
divorce
was
rendered,
plaintiff
wife
had
no
standing
in
new
york
to
maintain
the
present
action
for
separation
and
by
that
token
had
no
enforceable
right
to
invoke
the
benefits
of
the
section.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
of
course,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
of
course,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
think
she
could
under
the
alabama
statute,
if
she
asks
for
it.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
sir?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
don't
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
think
so.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well,
because
i'm
going
back
to
your
old
cases
of
haddock
against
haddock
and
atherton
against
atherton,
pennoyer
against
neff.
i
don't
think
that
was
any
good.
i
have
never,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
my
position
in
this
case
in
new
york.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
don't
know
what
the
law
is
in
alabama.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
the
constitutional
right
is
that
the
same
force
and
effect
is
to
be
given
to
the
nevada
decree
in
new
york
as
the
new
york
ex
parte
decree
and
all
i
know
is
that
a
new
york
ex
parte
decree
forecloses
all
alimony
to
a
wife
judged
guilty
of
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
misconduct.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
you're
not
talking
with
reference
to
this
case
i
hope?
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well,
if
you'll
forget
this
case
because
of
its
peculiar
facts
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
i
would
agree
that
nevada
has
no
right
to
cutoff
the
alimony
to
a
wife
who
has
not
been
guilty
of
any
misconduct.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
but
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
i
am
faced
with
a
great
dilemma
in
this
consideration,
sir.
you
said
again
and
again
that
the
nevada
decree
destroys
the
marriage
relationship
and
that
the
only
thing
you
can
attack
in
the
nevada
decree
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
well,
some
cases
hold
that
the
jurisdiction
is
good,
in
some
cases
holds
no
good.
in
this
case
they
held
the
jurisdiction
was
good
but
the
jurisdiction
itself
under
the
nevada
law
is
founded
upon
the
misconduct
of
the
wife.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
are
you
--
may
it
please
you.
judge
black
asked
me
my
personal
opinion.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
he
asked
my
opinion
of
this
case.
i'm
relying
on
whatever
judge
fuld
said
and
relying
upon
justice
peck
and
relying
in
addition
thereto
on
the
arguments
and
cases
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
but
you
see
the
trouble
is
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
well,
i
don't
have
to
agree
with
judge
fuld,
your
honor
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
--
if
i
don't
plea.
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
that's
right,
sir.
thank
god
for
that.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
[laughs]
--
mr.
sol
a.
rosenblatt
thank
you,
sir.
in
conclusion
i'd
like
to
say
this
one
thing.
i've
handled
myself
a
great
many
matrimonial
matters
and
i've
had
the
privilege
serving
on
the
new
york
commission
for
uniform
state
laws.
i
feel
that
the
field
which
is
being
embarked
upon
by
the
series
of
cases
and
which
in
each
case
cannot
possibly
consider
any
misconduct
problems
on
the
part
of
the
wife
is
a
field
which
ought
to
be
left
to
a
legislation
and
i
feel
very
strongly
that
you
will
not
on
serious
consideration
of
the
record
here,
you
will
not
hold
and
you
could
not
hold
that
this
defendant,
no
matter
how
villainous
you
might
consider
him,
has
had
due
process
in
this
case
where
he's
summoned
in
the
court
on
one
charge
and
then
found
guilty
on
another
without
notice
to
him.
thank
you.
