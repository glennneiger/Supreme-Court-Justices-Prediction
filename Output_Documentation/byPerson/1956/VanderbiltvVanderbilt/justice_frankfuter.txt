mr.
justice
frankfuter
under
the
statute?
mr.
justice
frankfuter
i
understand
it
in
the
others,
but
this
one.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
she
swore
this
--
mr.
justice
frankfuter
--
under
jurisdictional
requirement.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
as
--
mr.
justice
frankfuter
the
case
comes
--
as
the
case
comes
here.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
as
the
case
comes
here,
was
that
satisfaction
with
the
new
york
procedural
or
jurisdictional
requirement,
call
it
what
you
will
or
is
that
passed
on
by
the
new
york
courts
or
assume
to
be
satisfied
by
the
new
york
court?
mr.
justice
frankfuter
yes.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
am
i
anticipating?
mr.
justice
frankfuter
that
doesn't
make
a
difference
to
me.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
i
--
i
still
think
there's
a
difference
in
a
court
judgment
in
the
dissenting
opinion
and
that
old
fact.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
what
difference
does
it
make
that
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion?
go
on.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
i
don't
mean
to
foreclose
that.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
new
york
courts
did
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
justice
frankfuter
but
they
did
--
they
did
find
fulfillment
of
that
requirement
which
you
told
us
about.
mr.
justice
frankfuter
all
right.
