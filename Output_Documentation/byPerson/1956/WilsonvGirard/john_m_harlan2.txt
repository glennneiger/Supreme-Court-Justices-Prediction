justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
closing
affidavit
made
controverting
this
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
for
the
purposes
of
the
case
here,
you're
not
raising
any
question
but
that
this
action
was
in
line
of
this
man's
duty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
we
--
we
take
the
case
as
if
he's
there
with
specific
instructions
to
shoot
this
woman
given
by
his
commanding
officer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'll
put
it
this
way.
is
the
effect
of
your
stipulation
--
would
you
concede
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
decree,
the
united
states
had
primary
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
mean,
you
concede
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
simply
--
simply
the
question
is
then
whether
there
has
been
a
waiver
and
whether
the
waiver
was
--
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
where
--
where
is
the
exact
language
of
the
stipulation
in
the
record
you
made
below?
isn't
that
colloquy
with
the
trial
judge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
in
the
fact
is
actually
the
language,
isn't
it,
substantially
of
3a-2?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
a
question
there?
before
the
status
of
forces
agreements
went
in
to
effect,
what
was
the
situation
with
respect
to
canadians
and
britishers
in
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
had
visiting
canadians
during
the
war
before
--
before
the
status
of
force
--
forces
agreement
went
to
effect
received
no
immunity,
did
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
protocol
as
such
never
got
to
the
board
of
senate
i
take
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
position
that
we've
taken
on
reference
to
foreign
troops
in
our
soil?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
during
the
war,
mr.
robinson.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
citation
to
the
canadian
decision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
countries
are
those?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
to
that
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it's
premised
basically
on
the
proposition
that
as
a
matter
of
international
law
as
you
call
it,
the
united
states
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
japan
over
its
own
troops.
justice
john
m.
harlan
violation
of
japanese
law,
violation
of
american
law,
violation
of
both
japanese
and
american
laws
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
a
matter
of
law
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
a
matter
of
international
law
and
i
suppose
in
that
premise,
it
hasn't
accepted
what
becomes
to
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
constitutional
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
happens
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
assuming
that
your
premise
is
wrong
that
forbids
the
trial
of
an
american
abroad
for
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
another
country?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
how
can
the
united
states
constitution
take
away
the
right
of
japan
to
try
one
of
our
citizens
where
an
infraction
of
japanese
laws
committed
by
a
citizen,
an
american
citizen
in
japan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
you
mean
it
doesn't
come
under
the
agreements.
justice
john
m.
harlan
exact
isn't
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
specifically?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
administrative
agreement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
insofar
as
criminal
jurisdiction
is
concerned
over
that
area,
it
was
subject
to
the
terms
of
the
administrative
agreement
and
later
of
the
protocol,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
dependent
source
of
criminal
jurisdiction
with
reference
to
this
particular
area
other
than
the
agreements
that
we've
been
discussing
all
day,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
all
i
was
trying
to
get
at
was
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
it
correctly.
you're
not
advanced
are
you
in
your
argument
as
to
criminal
jurisdiction
by
the
--
what
you
read
from
the
arrangements
covering
this
area
beyond
what
you
have
to
stand
on
or
assert
under
the
other
agreements
as
to
jurisdiction.
