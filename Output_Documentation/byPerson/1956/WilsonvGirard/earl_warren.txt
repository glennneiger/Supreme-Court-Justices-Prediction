petitioner,
versus
charles

et

you
may
proceed,
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh.
we
--
we'll
wait
for
him
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
wasn't
aware
of
that.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
before
you
get
to
that,
there
is
in
the
record,
an
affidavit
of
the
chief
counsel
of
the
department
of
defense,
which
shows
more
precisely
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are.
would
you
mind
stating
the
circumstances
under
which
those
came
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
then,
general,
from
your
statement
that
the
affidavit
is
before
us
for
all
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
does
--
is
there
any
legal
reason
--
is
there
any
legal
reason
why
this
should
not
be
made
public
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so
in
the
writing
of
an
opinion
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
something
that
is
in
line
of
duty
and
--
and
an
act
that
was
merely
done
while
on
duty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
was
because
i
recall
you
stated
that
the
commanding
officer
had
at
all
times
taken
the
position
that
the
respondent
had
no
authority.
and
it
was
not
--
not
the
custom
for
him
to
put
any
blank
cartridge
in
his
grenade
--
in
his
hand
grenade.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
grenade
launcher
rather.
now,
the
--
would
that
statement
on
your
part
indicate
that
you
make
any
distinction
between
a
man
doing
an
act
merely
while
his
on
duty
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
an
act
done
pursuant
to
duty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now,
general,
what
--
what
i
was
trying
to
get
clear
in
--
in
my
mind
was
--
was
this.
leaving
--
leaving
the
question
of
waiver
entirely
out
of
the
case
for
the
moment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
there
in
this
case
a
legal
differentiation
between
an
act
done
merely
while
on
duty
on
the
one
hand
and
an
act
done
pursuant
to
duty
on
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
do
you
give
us
one
position
on
which
we
can
stand
either
that
--
either
that
it
was
done
pursuant
to
duty
or
--
or
something
different
from
that
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
--
oh,
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
if
i
may
revert
to
the
canadian
incident,
so-called,
again.
assume
that
the
canadian
forces
were
in
this
country
and
that
an
offense
was
committed
identical
with
this
in
all
respects.
is
there
any
precedent
for
determining
or
for
saying
whether
this
country
would
insist
upon
trying
the
defendant
or
whether
it
would
turn
him
over
to
the
canadian
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general
what
i
--
what
i
really
have
in
mind
was
this,
not
--
not
a
legal
precedent
but
is
there
any
administrative
precedent
in
the
country?
has
anything
of
this
kind
ever
happened
in
this
country
to
your
knowledge
where
we
acted
one
way
or
the
other
in
a
situation
comparable
to
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
on
that
--
on
that
question,
was
there
any
differentiation
between
where
we
were
conquering
troops
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
we
were
there
as
hosts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
as
--
as
guests
of
the
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
authority
to
--
what
--
what
authority
do
you
--
do
you
point
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
give
us
a
memorandum,
please,
of
that
and
any
other
citations
that
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
or
--
or
any
other
authority
that
you
referred
to
so
that
we
may
have
it
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
dispose
of
this
language
in
the
schooner
exchange
case
as
i
--
i
see
it
cited
on
--
or
quoted
on
page
23
of
the
government's
brief.
this
language
of
chief
justice
marshall.
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
is
a
branch
to
that
which
is
possessed
by
the
nation
as
an
independent
sovereign
power.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nation
within
its
own
territory
is
necessarily
exclusive
and
absolute.
it
is
susceptible
of
no
limitation,
not
imposed
by
itself.
any
restriction
upon
it,
to
writing
validity
from
an
external
source
would
imply
a
diminution
of
its
sovereignty
to
the
extent
of
the
restriction
and
in
investment
of
that
sovereignty
to
the
same
extent
in
that
power
which
could
impose
such
restriction.
all
exceptions
therefore
to
the
full
and
complete
power
of
a
nation
within
its
own
territory
must
be
traced
up
to
the
consent
of
the
nation
itself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
can
fall
from
no
other
legitimate
source.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
do
you
dispose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
document
you're
reading
from
is
part
of
the
congressional
record,
a
report
of
a
house
of
committee
or
is
it
a
speech
of
some
congressman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
use
that
in
this
country,
don't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
the
state
of
utah
uses
that
--
uses
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
robinson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robinson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
robinson,
before
you
--
just
before
you
sit
down,
this
morning
at
the
opening
of
your
argument,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
solicitor
general
had
made
far
joint
false
statements
to
this
court
for
the
purpose
of
deceiving
it
and
i
understood
you
to
say
you
would
demonstrate
that
in
your
argument
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i've
--
i've
listened
for
--
very
attentively
for
bill
in
particulars
along
those
lines
but
--
and,
of
course,
if
it's
true,
it
should
be
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
having
to
reflect
upon
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
integrity
of
the
solicitor
general
or
the
representation
he
was
making
for
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
is
no
representation
by
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
--
there's
no
use
pursuing
it
further,
but
i
was
going
to
say,
if
there
was
any
such
impression
intended
by
you
that
i
think,
in
all
fairness,
you
should
give
a
bill
of
particulars
at
this
time
so
we
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
least
answer
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
be
my
--
it
may
have
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
my
mistake.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carroll,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carroll,
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
this?
what
pertinence
does
this
document
quoted
on
page
37a
of
the
government's
brief
have?
it's
on
stationary
of
the
united
states
army
forces
far
east
and
united
states
army
administration
and
military
justice
and
related
matters.
now,
that
purports
to
--
to
define
what
a
line
of
duty
means,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
is
that
by
the
--
come
from
headquarters
of
the
--
of
our
army
in
--
in
japan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
the
term
official
duty
is
used
in
article
xvii,
the
official
minutes
and
the
agreed
views
is
not
meant
to
include
all
acts
by
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
civilian
component
during
periods
violated
on
duty,
but
is
meant
to
apply
only
to
acts
which
are
required
to
be
done
as
a
function
of
those
duties
which
the
individuals
are
performing.
thus,
a
substantial
departure
from
the
acts
a
person
is
required
to
perform
in
a
particular
duty
usually
will
indicate
an
act
outside
of
his
“official
duty”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
was
that
the
official
document
for
the
government
of
the
armed
forces
in
japan
or
not?
i
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
five
--
you
have
five
minutes
more.
it's
the
red
light.
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
end
of
your
time
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
all
right.
mr.
carroll,
on
submission
of
your
authorities,
it
won't
be
necessary
for
you
to
write
any
brief
or
to
quote
for
many
of
your
authorities
if
you
can
just
submit
to
us
by
tomorrow
morning
a
list
of
these
authorities
that
you've
relied
on
here
in
the
argument
and
you
may
do
it,
of
course,
by
--
in
typewritten
form.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
you
have
any
authorities
that
you've
referred
to
that
you
like
to
submit,
you
may
do
so
and
type
writing
for
--
by
tomorrow
morning
if
you
please.
mr.
carroll,
was
there
any
new
point
that
brief
--
you
might
want
to
raise
briefly
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
you
may
do
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
the
court
will
now
adjourn
until
a
further
order
of
the

chief

versus

these
cases
come
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
japan
and
the
united
states
became
involved
in
a
controversy
whether
the
respondent
girard
should
be
tried
by
a
japanese
court
for
causing
the
death
of
a
japanese
woman.
the
basis
for
the
dispute
between
the
two
governments
fully
appears
in
the
affidavit
of
robert
dechert,
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
defense,
an
exhibit
to
a
government
motion
in
the
court
below,
and
the
joint
statement
of
secretary
of
state,
john
foster
dulles
and
secretary
of
defense,
charles
e.
wilson,
printed
as
appendices
to
this
opinion.
girard,
a
specialist
third
class
in
the
united
states
army,
was
engaged
on
january
30,
1957,
with
members
of
his
cavalry
regiment
in
a
small
unit
exercise
at
camp
weir
range
area,
japan.
japan's
civilians
were
present
in
the
area,
retrieving
expended
cartridge
cases.
girard
and
another
specialist
third
class
were
ordered
to
guard
a
machine
gun
and
some
items
of
clothing
that
had
been
left
nearby.
girard
had
a
grenade
launcher
on
his
rifle.
he
placed
an
expended
30-caliber
cartridge
case
in
the
grenade
launcher
and
projected
it
by
firing
a
blank.
the
expended
cartridge
case
penetrated
the
back
of
a
japanese
woman
gathering
expended
cartridge
cases
and
caused
her
death.
the
united
states
ultimately
notified
japan
that
girard
would
be
delivered
to
the
japanese
authorities
for
trial.
thereafter,
japan
indicted
him
for
causing
death
by
wounding.
girard
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
writ
was
denied,
but
girard
was
granted
declaratory
relief
and
an
injunction
against
his
delivery
to
the
japanese
authorities.
the
petitioners
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and,
without
awaiting
action
by
that
court
on
the
appeal,
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
28
u.s.c.section
1254(1).
girard
filed
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
denial
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.we
granted
both
petitions.
a
security
treaty
between
japan
and
the
united
states,
signed
september
8,
1951,
was
ratified
by
the
senate
on
march
20,
1952,
and
proclaimed
by
the
president
effective
april

"the
conditions
which
shall
govern
the
disposition
of

of
the
united
states
of
america
in
and
about
japan."
expressly
acting
under
this
provision,
the
two
nations,
on
february
28,
1952,
signed
an
administrative
agreement
covering,
among
other
matters,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
over
offenses
committed
in
japan
by
members
of
the
united
states
armed
forces,
and
providing
that
jurisdiction
in
any
case
might
be
waived
by
the
united
states.
this
agreement
became
effective
on
the
same
date
as
the
security
treaty
namely,
april
28,
1952
and
was
considered
by
the
senate
before
consent
was
given
to
the
treaty.
article
xvii,
paragraph
1,
of
the
administrative
agreement
provided
that
upon
the
coming
into
effect
of
the
"agreement
between
the
parties
to
the
north
atlantic
treaty
regarding
the
status
of
their
forces,"
signed
july
--
signed
june

1951,
the
united
states
would
conclude
with
japan
an
agreement
on
criminal
jurisdiction
similar
to
the
corresponding
provisions
of
the
nato
agreement.
the
nato
agreement
became
effective
august
23,
1953,
and
the
united

and
japan
signed
on

article
xxvi
of
the
administrative
agreement
established
a
joint
committee
of
representatives
of
the
united
states
and
japan
to
consult
on
all
matters
requiring
mutual
consultation
regarding
the
implementation
of
the
agreement
and
provided
that
if
the
committee
is
unable
to
resolve
any
matter,
it
shall
refer
that
matter
to
the
respective
governments
for
further
consideration
through
appropriate
channels.
in
the
light
of
the
senate's
ratification
of
the
security
treaty
after
consideration
of
the
administrative
agreement,
which
had
already
been
signed,
and
its
subsequent
ratification
of
the
nato
agreement,
with
knowledge
of
the
commitment
to
japan
under
the
administrative
agreement,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
approval
of
article
iii
of
the
security
treaty
authorized
the
making
of
the
administrative
agreement
and
the
subsequent
protocol
embodying
the
nato
agreement
provisions
governing
jurisdiction
to
try
criminal
offenses.
the
united
states
claimed
the
right
to
try
girard
upon
the
ground
that
his
act,
as
certified
by
his
commanding
officer,
was
done
in
the
performance
of
official
duty,
and
therefore,
the
united
states
had
primary
jurisdiction.
japan
insisted
that
it
had
proof
that
girard's
action
was
without
the
scope
of
his
official
duty
and
therefore,
that
japan
had
the
primary
right
to
try
him.
the
joint
committee,
after
prolonged
deliberations,
was
unable
to
agree.
the
issue
was
referred
to
higher
authority,
which
authorized
the
united
states
representatives
on
the
joint
committee
to
notify
the
appropriate
japanese
authorities,
in
accordance
with
paragraph
3(c)
of
the
protocol,
that
the
united
states
had
decided
not
to
exercise,
but
to
waive
whatever
jurisdiction
it
might
have
in
the
case.
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
secretary
of
defense
decided
that
this
determination
should
be
carried
out.
the
president
confirmed
their
joint
conclusion.
a
sovereign
nation
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
punish
offenses
against
its
laws
committed
within
its
borders,
unless
it
expressly
or
impliedly
consents
to
surrender
its
jurisdiction.

authority
of
schooner
exchange
versus
m'faddon
in

in
an
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
marshall.
japan's
cession
to
the
united
states
of
jurisdiction
to
try
military
personnel
for
conduct
constituting
an
offense
against
the
laws
of
both
countries
was
conditioned
by
the
covenant
of
article
xvii,
section
3,
paragraph
(c)
of
the
protocol
to
the
effect
that
the
authorities
of
the
state
having
the
primary
right
shall
give
sympathetic
consideration
to
a
request
from
the
authorities
of
the
other
state
for
a
waiver
of
its
right
in
cases
where
the
other
state
considers
such
waiver
to
be
of
particular
importance.
the
issue
for
our
decision
is
therefore
narrowed
to
the
question
whether,
upon
the
record
before
us,
the
constitution
or
legislation
subsequent
to
the
security
treaty
prohibited
the
carrying
out
of
this
provision
authorized
by
the
treaty
for
waiver
of
the
qualified
jurisdiction
granted
by
japan.
we
find
no
constitutional
or
statutory
--
statutory
barrier
to
the
provision
as
applied
here.
in
the
absence
of
such
encroachment,
the
wisdom
of
the
arrangement
is
exclusively
for
the
determination
of
the
executive
and
legislative
branches.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in

is
reversed,
and

affirmed.
