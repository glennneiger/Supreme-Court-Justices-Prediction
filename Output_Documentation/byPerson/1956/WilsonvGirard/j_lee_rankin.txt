mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
noticed
mr.
carroll
left
the
courtroom,
your
honor,
shall
i
proceed?
he
was
just
admitted.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
has
the
right
to
decline
to
prosecute
a
soldier
and
let
him
be
prosecuted
under
japanese
law
where
there
is
concurring
jurisdiction.
and
should
the
united
states
court
review
that
decision?
the
facts
are
these.
january
30th
of
1957,
a
military
unit
of
the
united
states
was
maneuvering
on
camp
weir
in
japan.
this
maneuver
area
was
an
area
that
was
part
at
the
time
assigned
to
the
united
states
to
use.
about
40%
of
the
time
was
used
by
the
japanese
defense
troops.
and
the
balance,
a
substantial
portion
at
that
time
was
used
by
japanese
civilians
for
farming
and
other
purposes.
at
this
time,
during
the
maneuvers,
there
were
so
many
japanese
nationals
in
the
area
that
the
commander
decided
that
it
was
unsafe
to
continue
to
use
live
ammunition
in
the
maneuvers.
and
he
directed
that
blank
ammunition
be
used
from
that
time
on.
during
an
interval
in
the
maneuvers,
the
respondent
and
another
soldier
by
the
name
of
nickel
were
directed
to
guard
a
machine
gun
and
some
field
jackets
on
a
hill.
they
proceeded
to
this
ridge
and
then
the
respondent
placed
a
blank
cartridge
in
his
grenade
launcher
and
using
a
blank,
he
discharged
it.
he
put
two
times
toward
japanese
nationals
in
that
area.
the
second
shot
out
of
the
grenade
launcher
of
this
empty
cartridge
case
struck
a
japanese
married
woman
in
the
back
and
caused
her
death.
the
commander
of
the
unit
of
the
respondent
certified
that
this
act,
the
killing,
was
an
act
in
pursuit
--
in
the
performance
of
the
respondent's
duties.
this
was
done
on
february
7th.
on
february
9th,
the
japanese
protested
the
certificate
and
claimed
that
the
machine
gun
was
never
at
any
time
threatened
by
the
japanese
that
there
was
no
effort
to
interfere
or
molest
it.
and
the
action
was
not
done
in
performance
of
official
duty.
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
fire
this
empty
cartridge
out
of
the
grenade
launcher
in
the
protection
or
a
guard
of
the
machine
gun
and
these
field
jackets.
there
was
a
procedure
set
up
by
the
two
governments
whereby
a
joint
committee
would
inquire
into
the
question
if
there
was
a
dispute.
and
for
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
affidavit
recites
in
detail
the
fact
that
there
were
certain
witnesses
who
have
stated,
including
the
--
the
soldier
nickel
that
they
were
directed
and
the
soldiers
proceeded
to
throw
out
these
empty
cartridges
to
invite
or
entice
the
japanese
civilians
to
come
and
try
to
get
them
and
take
them
away
to
sell
and
recover
what
value
they
could
out
of
it.
and
that
there
was
actually
a
--
an
invitation
for
them
to
come
forward
and
pick
them
up
prior
to
the
time
of
the
discharge
of
this
empty
cartridge
out
of
the
grenade
launcher.
and
that
goes
into
considerable
detail
in
reciting
these
facts.
and
it
was
presented
to
the
lower
court
and
was
sealed
at
the
request
to
the
government
to
protect
the
respondent
from
any
adverse
effect
upon
his
trial.
the
government
has
no
other
interest
in
having
it
sealed.
and
it
is
in
this
court
for
its
consideration
in
a
sealed
form
if
the
court
cares
to
go
into
that
detail.
but
there
was
a
very
real
conflict
as
to
even
the
two
soldiers
involved
in
regard
to
the
facts.
and
whether
there
was
enticement
and
whether
these
japanese
civilians
were
invited
in
fact
to
come
forward
and
then
have
this
empty
cartridge
launched
against
them
out
of
the
grenade
launcher.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
was
examined
according
to
the
proceedings
that
i
read
in
the
court
below
over
at
recess.
and
at
first,
counsel
indicated
that
they
didn't
want
to
consider
at
all
but
finally
they
appeared
to
agree
that
they
would
prefer
to
have
it
sealed
rather
than
open
to
the
public
for
examination.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
we
are
willing
to
have
it
considered
by
the
court
fully.
the
only
purpose
of
having
it
sealed
was
to
protect
the
respondent
in
his
trial
in
case
it
occurred
in
japan
or
court-martial
depending
upon
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
is
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
cannot
speak
for
the
other
side
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
there
is
not.
the
only
problem
is
whether
he
--
the
respondent
will
be
prejudiced
by
it
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
he
is,
the
fact
that
he
brings
the
matter
here
to
this
court
for
its
consideration,
the
court
is
entitled
to
have
all
of
the
facts
before
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
--
no.
there
was
a
denial.
and
i
think
the
record
is
that
there
is
a
--
a
denial
by
the
respondent
that
there
was
any
enticement
on
his
part.
the
affidavit
does
show
that
the
other
soldier
goes
in
to
some
detail
in
describing
how
he
was
instructed
by
the
respondent
to
throw
out
the
cartridges
and
invite
the
japanese
civilians
to
come
forward
and
pick
them
up.
but
he
continues
to
--
the
respondent
continues
to
deny
that.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
a
fair
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
is
that
the
respondent
did
seek
to
raise
issues
of
fact.
and
that
the
government
stipulated
that
insofar
as
this
particular
proceeding
was
concerned,
and
for
no
other
purpose,
that
this
act
was
in
the
performance
of
official
duty
and
thereby
eliminated
that
kind
of
an
issue
of
fact.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
the
lower
court
found
that
there
was
no
issue
of
fact
in
passing
upon
the
case.
now,
on
the
certificate
by
the
commanding
officer
of
the
respondent
continues
in
effect.
the
government
has
taken
the
position
at
all
times
that
there
was
never
any
authorization
for
the
use
of
the
grenade
launcher
and
the
rifle
in
this
manner
in
ejecting
a
empty
cartridge
against
any
personnel
of
any
kind.
and
it
is
not
--
it
has
not
been
claimed
up
to
date
by
the
respondent
that
he
was
authorized
or
directed
to
do
anything
of
that
nature.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
are
--
we
stipulated
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
isn't
necessary
that
there
would
be
a
direction
or
an
order
to
do
the
shooting
for
it
to
be
an
act
in
the
performance
of
official
duty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
only
go
so
far
as
to
stipulate
that
it
was
an
act
in
the
performance
of
official
duty.
what
--
what
that
means
under
the
record
and
under
the
facts
here.
so
that
now,
it
is
important
as
we
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
understood
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
to
be
possibly
the
implied
order
as
distinguished
--
a
direct
order
as
distinguished
from
an
implied
order.
it
could
be
under
the
line
of
official
duty
if
it
was
something
that
was
required
under
the
agreed
rules
that
the
joint
committee
had
established.
even
though
no
officer
had
ever
instructed
him
to
do
this
particular
act.
and
the
inquiry,
as
i
understand
it,
from
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
whether
or
not
he
was
directed
or
ordered
to
do
this
act.
and
we
do
not
agree
that
he
was
ever
ordered
or
directed
or
he
was
even
authorized
to
use
this
rifle
and
the
grenade
launcher
in
this
--
in
this
manner.
but
we
do
--
did
stipulate
a
law
and
continue
to
abide
by
it
by
here.
that
he
was
--
the
act
was
in
performance
of
official
duty
in
accordance
with
the
protocol.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
our
contention,
yes,
throughout.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
we
concede
that,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
authorized
and
proper.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now
--
but
there
is
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
we
think
that
it
is
important
to
the
consideration
of
the
case,
these
other
facts
of
whether
there
was
enticement
or
an
invitation
to
come
forward
and
pick
up
this
blank
or
empty
cartridges
in
that
it
bears
upon
the
whole
posture
of
the
situation
when
the
executive
decided
to
decline
to
prosecute
or
to
waive
the
jurisdiction
assume
that
the
united
states
had
a
right
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
in
this
situation
because
there
had
to
be
a
consideration
by
the
executive
of
the
position
of
japan
that
this
was
not
within
the
requirements
of
official
duty.
and
that
this
was
not
authorized.
and
it
was
not
necessary
because
there
was
no
threat
to
the
machine
gun
and
field
jackets
to
do
anything
of
this
character.
all
of
that
had
to
be
considered
by
the
executive
in
passing
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
decline
jurisdiction
or
waive
jurisdiction,
which
were
rights
that
belonged
to
the
state
rather
than
any
individual.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
question
about
that
under
the
protocol.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
is
a
distinction
and
the
protocol
deals
specifically
with
an
act
done
in
the
performance
of
official
duty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
discussed
in
newspapers
about
where
a
man
might
be
on
duty
but
do
something
so
far
removed
from
what
would
be
in
performance
of
that
duty.
that
it
couldn't
be
within
the
requirements
of
the
protocol
for
primary
jurisdiction.
but
that
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
pretty
generally
the
--
the
responding
of
superior
problems
what's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
his
grenade
launcher.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
the
--
let
me
clarify
in
regard
to
that.
the
position
not
only
the
commanding
officer
of
the
man
but
of
the
government
itself,
the
defense
department
is
that
there
never
was
any
authority
for
using
this
empty
cartridge
in
the
grenade
launcher
in
the
manner
it
was
done.
and
it
was
their
position.
and
the
controversy
all
the
time
between
japan
and
the
united
states
was
whether
this
ever
did
come
within
the
requirements
of
the
protocol
on
regard
to
primary
jurisdiction
for
the
united
states
court-martial.
and
that
if
it
was
something
that
was
unauthorized,
that
gave
validity
to
their
contention
all
the
way
along
that
there
wasn't
any
authority
and
he
had
no
right
to
do
this
and
it
couldn't
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
treaty.
and
the
united
states
was
continually
asserting
the
other
position
before
the
joint
committee
in
order
that
it
should
try
to
claim
the
primary
jurisdiction.
but
the
two
countries
couldn't
agree
in
the
joint
committee
in
the
provisions
that
were
made
under
the
protocol
for
implementing
but
that
was
true.
and
so
they
went
on
for
a
period
of
--
from
the
middle
of
march
to
the
middle
of
may
arguing
about
it,
whether
or
not
it
was
in
fact
within
the
performance
of
official
duty.
and
if
not,
it
was
clear
under
the
treaty
that
japan
would
have
the
primary
jurisdiction.
and
this
was
--
this
was
a
case
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
because
it
was
a
violation
of
both
the
japanese
law
and
the
military
code.
and
if
--
if
it
was
not
in
the
performance
of
official
duty,
it
was
clearly
something
that
japan
would
have
a
right
to
prosecute
under
the
protocol
under
section
3
(b).
and
if
it
was,
we
would
be
--
we
would
have
the
right,
the
primary
right.
and
in
any
event,
the
protocol
provided
that
we
could
waive
it
or
we
could
decline
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction.
so,
we
had
that
constant
controversy
in
the
joint
committee
that
was
assigned
to
try
to
resolve
this
kind
of
problem
in
the
period
between
the
middle
of
march
and
the
middle
of
may.
and
the
japanese
continued
to
assert
their
position
that
it
just
could
not
be
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
performance
of
official
duty.
and
the
agreed
statement
of
what
is
required
for
that
by
the
united
states
and
japan
was
that
it
had
to
be
some
act
required
by
the
particular
duty.
and
the
japanese
asserted
it
just
couldn't
comply
with
that.
and
we
continued,
we
still
have
that
certificate
in
effect
even
after
the
day
and
continued
to
assert
in
a
--
a
conference
between
the
two
parties
and
the
joint
committee
that
it
was
in
the
performance
of
official
duty.
we
didn't
convince
them.
they
didn't
convince
us.
so,
it
then
came
down
to
the
proposition
of
what
the
executives
should
do
to
try
to
resolve
this
international
incident
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
between
the
two
contending
countries.
and
the
executive
looking
at
the
facts,
looking
at
the
contentions
on
both
sides
and
the
lack
of
harmony
between
the
--
the
parties
and
the
various
witnesses
as
to
what
happened
and
the
contention
of
--
of
substance
that
there
had
been
enticement
--
inducement
to
--
to
come
and
get
the
empty
cartridges
before
the
act,
considering
all
of
it
and
the
feeling
of
the
japanese
and
the
fact
that
they
had
some
90%
--
97%
of
the
time
in
5400
incidents
when
in
a
year's
time
given
away
to
the
united
states
and
waived
their
primary
jurisdictions,
the
executive
finally
decided
to
waive
this
jurisdiction.
and
the
secretary
of
defense
and
the
secretary
of
state
and
then
the
president
himself
reviewed
the
matter
and
approved
the
action
to
decline
the
jurisdiction
and
proceed
to
notify
japan
of
the
waiver.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
is
the
position
of
the
government
that
even
if
it
was
an
act
done
in
the
performance
of
official
duty
or
an
act
done
in
the
line
of
duty
which
is
not
the
technical
words
of
the
treaty
and
therefore
probably
would
give
japan
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
the
united
states
has
the
power
and
authority
under
the
law
to
decline
jurisdiction
and
waive
it
regardless
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
of
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
think
our
stipulation
clearly
binds
us
in
this
court
that
this
act
complies
with
the
requirement
of
the
protocol
for
an
act
done
in
the
performance
of
duty
as
far
as
the
posture
of
this
case
before
this
court
is
concerned.
and
so,
the
court
must
take
that
as
far
as
that
element
is
concerned
and
assume
that
regardless
of
what
the
facts
of
the
dispute
regarding
the
facts
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
this
act
is
or
was
done
in
performance
of
official
duty
and
therefore,
complied
with
the
requirement
for
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
protocol.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
what?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
--
the
soldier
is
instructed
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
duty
was
to
guard
the
machine
gun
and
the
field
jackets
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
on
the
ridge.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
from
anyone
who
might
try
to
damage
them
or
take
them
away,
anything
of
that
character.
the
japanese
contended
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
what
the
japanese
contended
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i'm
not
free
in
this
court
to
contend
that
this
is
an
issue
before
this
court
any
longer.
i
do
want
to
--
the
--
understood
however,
that
i
do
think
the
facts
of
enticing
and
the
detail
of
all
of
those
facts
have
a
real
bearing
on
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
the
executive
to
take
the
action
that
he
did
regarding
the
question
of
declining
to
exercise
jurisdiction
or
waiving
jurisdiction.
but
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
where
the
primary
jurisdiction
is
found
under
the
protocol,
i
think
that
we
are
bound
by
our
stipulation
in
the
lower
court
and
in
this
court
that
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
that's
what
--
the
way
i
understood
it,
mr.
justice.
i
just
want
to
be
clear
all
the
time
that
i
was
reserving
the
other
consideration
because
i
think
it's
important
to
the
case.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
last
answer
at
the
bottom
of
page
46a
and
falling
on
47a
would
give
you
the
commitment
that
the
government
made
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
now,
it
seems
to
the
government
that
the
--
the
legal
questions
involved
in
the
case
are
these.
the
primary
question
is
whether
or
not
under
international
law
there
is
any
immunity
from
--
in
the
respondent
from
the
laws
of
japan
for
an
offense
committed
in
japan.
there's
no
question
of
what
the
offense
was
committed
in
japan.
and
that
the
respondent
has
always
been
in
japan
since
the
offense
was
committed.
so,
we
have
to
turn
to
international
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
immunity
from
the
laws
of
japan
for
the
respondent
or
any
soldier
located
in
that
country
without
a
protocol
or
treaties
or
agreements
of
any
kind.
and
we
believe
that
in
the
first
place,
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
government,
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
that
there
is
no
immunity
under
international
law
for
even
a
friendly
force
in
a
--
a
foreign
country
such
as
japan.
and
that
goes
back
to
the
schooner
exchange
case
that
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
not
directly
but
by
reference
from
the
covert
and
(inaudible)
cases
in
which
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
would
--
would
not
be
immunity.
and
it
was
recognized
in
the
schooner
exchange
case
by
this
court
that
any
interference
or
any
claim
of
immunity
whatsoever
in
the
country,
with
a
friendly
force
would
be
a
reduction
in
the
sovereignty
of
that
country.
and
it
would
be
taken
onto
the
other
country
that
claimed
it,
a
portion
of
that
sovereign.
and,
of
course,
in
that
case,
the
chief
justice
marshall
recognized
that
even
if
there
was
an
implied
immunity
which
he
recognized
as
to
the
schooner
exchange
itself
that
that
could
be
modified
at
any
time
by
the
sovereign
of
the
country
where
the
friendly
force
was.
the
host
country
by
any
agreement
or
by
proceeding
to
by
force
or
by
submitting
the
particular
force
to
his
courts
and
thereby,
remove
any
implied
immunity
that
there
might
be.
now,
that
the
government
has
not
been
able
to
find
any
country,
any
sovereign
country
in
the
world
that
recognizes
the
right
of
an
immunity
under
international
law.
so
that
it
is
--
has
been
the
position
of
the
united
states
both
in
the
legislative
and
the
executive
branches
in
the
consideration
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
treaty
that
there
is
no
immunity
of
--
under
international
law
on
the
laws
of
the
host
country
as
to
a
friendly
force.
now,
there
--
there
is
a
conflict
between
some
of
the
writers
in
regard
to
that.
but
they
cite
no
authority
of
any
practice
where
any
country
has
been
willing
to
recognize
such
a
limitation
upon
their
sovereign.
and
i
think
the
outstanding
examples
in
regard
to
the
position
of
the
united
states
are,
that
back
in
1942,
we
considered
this
question
in
the
congress.
and
the
application
concerning
the
military
courts
of
various
countries
at
that
time
and
also
the
fact
that
britain,
as
a
part
of
the
war
effort
had
granted
a
complete
immunity
to
united
states
forces.
and
the
british
at
the
time,
they
adopted
such
a
position
stated
that
it
was
a
very
great
departure
from
their
practice
and
traditions.
it
was
only
done
because
of
the
exigencies
of
the
war
and
the
position
they
were
in
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
most
that
we
have
ever
conceded
with
regard
to
the
soil
of
the
united
states
is
that
and
provided
in
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
which
is
reciprocal
in
that
it
provides
the
same
kind
of
immunity
limited
in
the
same
way
that
was
--
that
is
discussed
in
this
case
in
regard
to
japan.
we
grant,
as
to
the
particular
force
and
acts
of
the
--
that
are
committed
by
that
force
against
its
own
people
while
on
the
base
and
so
forth
and
we
get
the
primary
jurisdiction
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
its
entirely
reciprocal
between
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
often
have
canadians.
we
often
have
canadian
troops.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
of
course.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
claimed
in,
under
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
that
we
have
the
right
as
to
other
countries
to
decide
when
the
primary
jurisdiction
lay
because
of
performance
of
official
duty.
and
we
were
not
successful
in
maintaining
that
position.
the
--
when
the
matter
came
before
the
british
courts,
the
parliament,
british
parliament
--
parliament,
they
just
would
not
accept.
and
they
insisted
that
there
be
a
provision
that
their
courts
could
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
--
it
was
satisfied
as
to
performance
of
official
duty.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
oh,
well.
then
after
that,
the
canadians
asserted
a
similar
position.
and
it
came
up
for
discussion
in
our
congress
in
one
of
the
committees
of
the
senate.
and
senator
hickman
commented
upon
it
and
said
that
in
iowa,
they
certainly
wouldn't
be
satisfied
to
have
the
canadian
corps
decide
whether
or
not
some
canadian
soldier
that
would
kill
someone
in
iowa
would
be
acting
in
the
line
of
duty.
and
they
would
want
in
iowa,
certainly,
to
have
the
iowa
courts
pass
upon
that
question.
and
in
this
protocol,
it's
provided
that
the
japanese
court
would
have
the
right
to
pass
upon
that
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
it
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
true.
although
our
state
department
contends
that
there
would
still
be
a
possibility
of
having
it
resolved
on
a
diplomatic
level
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
if
it
didn't
--
it
couldn't
be
resolved
there
and
they
insisted
upon
it,
then
we
would
get
down
to
the
place
where
the
courts
would
have
to
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
would
not
recognize
any
immunity
from
our
laws,
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
--
we
did
recognize
providing
there
was
a
presidential
determination
that
was
necessary
that
they
could
court-martial
such
visiting
troops.
but
we
never
recognized
any
immunity
from
our
courts
either
state
or
federal.
in
fact,
we
expressly
rejected
any
such
concept.
and
it
was
suggested
by
senator
revercomb
in
the
senate
when
they
were
considering
the
--
this
particular
provision
allowing
their
courts-martial
to
discipline
their
troops
but
that
kind
of
a
procedure
instead
of
half
the
immunity.
at
that
time,
he
suggested
that
since
the
british
were
willing
to
grant
complete
immunity
to
us
from
their
courts
that
we
should
make
the
same
grant
for
visiting
forces
of
the
british
within
the
united
states.
and
the
congress
rejected
that
idea.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
only
precedent
is
the
position
of
the
congress
in
this
--
when
this
matter
came
up
as
to
immunity
that
i
know
of
and
i
can't
conceive
that
our
people
would
be
satisfied
to
recognize
any
limitations
of
the
constitution
of
--
of
canada
or
the
statutes
of
canada
that
would
be
binding
upon
the
courts
of
this
country
in
regard
to
whether
we
were
trying
or
committing
some
homicide
against
our
people.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
--
the
congress
rejected
the
idea
explicitly.
and
we
have
only
recognized
this
to
the
extent
of
the
nato
force
--
status
of
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
forces
treaty
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
where
there's
considerable
limitations
on
it
and
there
are
provisions
for
protecting
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
interest
of
the
respective
countries.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
we'll
examine
that.
i
haven't
heard
of
any
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it
would
have
come
to
our
attention
during
the
consideration
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
were
5400
cases
in
one
year's
time
ending
november
30
of
1956,
as
i
recall.
and
97.5%
of
the
time
the
japanese
waived
their
primary
rights.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
mainly
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
those
were
traffic
offenses
and
lesser
offenses.
but
there
were
some
of
real
substance.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
our
practice
has
not
been
so
liberal.
we
have
not
waived
in
very
many
cases.
there's
one
british
case
that
i
know
of
in
which
there
was
a
waiver
in
order
that
--
in
the
homicide
case
where
a
soldier
and
a
girl
went
out
in
a
taxicab.
and
they
killed
the
taxicab
driver.
and
they
--
the
girl
would
obviously
be
a
subject
to
the
british
law
and
the
soldier
would
not
under
the
treaty
and
we
waived
in
that
situation.
they
were
both
tried
in
britain
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
our
way
--
we
haven't
waived
very
often.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
advised
mr.
justice
by
my
associates
that
we
have
never
been
asked
to
waive.
that
there
are
only
three
or
four
cases
of
such
crimes
that
have
occurred
and
we
were
never
asked
to
waive.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
try
to
follow
that
up.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we'll
see
if
we
have
that
information
in
our
attention.
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'm
getting
into
a
field
that
i'm
not
an
expert
in
regard
to
what
maneuvering
areas
we
have.
but,
of
course,
we
have
here,
i
know,
troops
that
are
engaged
in
the
--
in
the
study
of
various
methods
that
we
have
in
our
defense
department.
and
they
might
very
well
be
participating
in
maneuvers
that
our
troops
are
engaged
in
but
nothing
of
the
character
or
the
size
are
of
a
large
number
of
troops
that
are
involved
in
this
particular
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'll
try
to
find
out
if
there's
any
answer
to
that
whether
such
an
event
has
occurred,
whether
that
has
happened
on
any
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
find
the
difference,
mr.
justice,
in
fact
that
if
he
was
directed
to
guard
certain
weapon
and
certain
field
jackets.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
instructions
were
limited
to
the
machine
gun
and
the
field
jackets.
that
was
all
of
his
instructions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
that
about
40%
of
the
time,
it
was
used
by
the
japanese
defense
forces.
it
was
used
a
balance
of
the
portion
of
the
time
by
the
united
states
and
the
remainder
which
was
a
substantial
portion
of
the
time
by
the
japanese
civilians
in
farming
and
other
activities
of
various
kinds.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
and
also
by
the
japanese
civilians.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
for
farming
and
all
kinds
of
civilian
activities.
it
was
a
maneuver
area
as
distinguished
from
the
ordinary
base.
it
was
a
very
--
it
was
a
substantially
large
area.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
particular
part
was
not
a
firing
range.
but
it
was
being
used
for
maneuvers
and
there
was
firing
on
it
during
the
first
portions
of
the
new
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
they
used
live
ammunitions
at
first.
and
the
commander
found
that
that
was
unsafe
because
of
the
japanese
civilians
in
the
area
and
instructed
them
to
use
blanks.
and
they
did
use
blanks
from
then
on.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
the
instruction
to
guard
the
machine
gun
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
record
in
the
affidavit
of
the
general
counsel
of
defense
department
would
show
that
the
practice
was
to
let
the
japanese
civilians
pick
up
shells
before
and
after
this
period
for
sometime.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
there
would
a
very
material
difference
in
the
case
if
he'd
been
instructed
to
guard
this
machine
and
these
cartridges
or
these
empty
cartridges.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
insofar
as
the
law
is
concerned,
there
wouldn't
be
any
difference
insofar
as
--
of
the
japanese
right
to
try
the
man
because
he
--
he
would
not
be
immune
from
their
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
then
you
come
into
what
the
rights
are
under
the
treaty
which
they
contend
are
invalid
that
the
government
had
no
authority
to
make
them
and
reduced
the
rights
of
the
respondent
by
making
them
because
they
claim
that
he
had
absolute
immunity
from
the
japanese
law.
so
that
their
case
depends
upon
whether
or
not
you
find
under
international
law
that
there
was
an
absolute
immunity
from
japanese
law.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
case
isn't
here
but
the
--
the
purpose
of
providing
as
the
government
did
in
the
agreements
that
in
such
cases
they
would
have
primary
jurisdiction
is
to
try
to
protect
against
that
very
situation.
so
that
he
is
not
in
conflict
between
the
law
of
japan.
and
the
fact
that
he
has
no
immunity
under
that
law.
and
the
direction
of
his
superior
for
which
he
might
be
court-martialed
if
he
didn't
comply.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
government
got
the
provision
in
the
treaty
to
try
to
protect
that
situation.
but
even
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
all
the
way
through
the
agreements
and
the
law
there's
no
question
with
what
the
government
has
the
right
to
decline
to
prosecute
or
--
or
to
waive
the
right
to
prosecute.
it's
a
governmental
right.
it
belongs
to
the
state
and
not
to
the
individual.
so
that
the
government
has
the
right,
even
though
he
was
acting
in
accordance
with
the
instructions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
the
difficulty
with
your
question,
mr.
justice,
is
that
the
government
doesn't
have
any
right
to
keep
japan
from
prosecuting
someone
who
commits
an
offense
against
their
law
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
within
their
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
and
they
have
the
power
either
by
insisting
that
he
submit
himself
to
their
courts
as
are
--
the
chief
justice
marshall
recognized
in
the
schooner
exchange
case
or
by
the
use
of
force
because
there
is
no
immunity
from
their
laws.
and
he
commits
the
offense
against
their
laws.
and
we
can't
withhold
him
from
that
because
there
is
no
international
law
that
recognizes
that
power.
now,
the
only
way
we
can
possibly
withhold
him
is
to
the
extent
that
we
can
make
treaties,
which
reduce
that
sovereign
power
of
the
other
sovereign
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
even
those
writers
in
regard
to
international
law
that
claimed
that
there's
an
implied
immunity
which
they
are
unable
to
support
by
any
showing
that
is
recognized
by
any
country
of
the
world
or
practice,
agree
that
that
immunity
can
be
waived
by
agreement
of
the
country
involved.
so,
we
have
the
situation
where
there
is
no
--
under
international
law,
there
is
no
immunity,
in
the
first
place.
the
most
extreme
position
of
the
theorists
in
regard
to,
is
that
it
could
be
waived
by
any
kind
of
an
agreement.
so
that
here
we
have
action
by
the
two
countries
who
are
unwilling
to
recognize
immunity
or
leave
it
to
that,
provided
--
provided
in
treaties,
how
it
should
be
handled.
and
we
have
the
--
the
security
treaty,
which
was
entered
into
between
the
two
countries
and
was
ratified
by
the
action
of
the
senate.
and
it
came
into
force
on
april
28th
of
1952.
now,
at
the
same
time
that
the
congress
considered
that
security
treaty
which
provides
in
one
--
in
a
paragraph
of
article
iii,
the
conditions
which
shall
govern
the
disposition
of
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
of
america
in
and
about
japan
shall
be
determined
by
administrative
agreements
between
two
governments.
at
the
same
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
only
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--only
provision
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
the
treaty
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
that's
the
only
treaty,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
as
the
same
time
that
the
senate
considered
that
treaty,
they
had
before
it
the
administrative
agreement
which
provided
in
detail
for
the
article
xvii
which
gave
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
--
they
had
and
considered,
it
was
already
signed
and
they
considered
this
administrative
agreement.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
it
--
and
it
was
published
twice
in
the
congressional
record.
it
was
considered
in
the
debates.
and
there
was
a
motion
made
by
senator
jenner
to
have
this
treaty,
this
administrative
agreement
brought
back
to
the
senate
for
action
by
the
senate
before
it
would
become
effective.
and
that
motion
was
rejected
by
a
vote
of
45
to
22.
so
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
between
japan
and
the
united
states.
so
that
the
senate
took
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there's
only
one
more
step
that
i
have
to
cover.
but
before
leaving
the
administrative
agreement,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
a
part
of
this
motion
that
was
made
by
senator
jenner
was
that
involved
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
president
could
declare
a
war
or
the
congress
could
declare
a
war
and
so
forth.
but
the
issue
was
squarely
in
the
motion.
whether
or
not
this
particular
administrative
agreement,
which
had
been
signed
prior
to
that
time,
had
to
be
brought
back
to
the
senate
for
action.
and
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
its
on
page
7a,
march
20th,
1952.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
1952.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
which
was
the
same
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
they
both
entered
into
force
at
the
same
date.
you
see
that
on
page
7a,
the
treaty
entered
and
in
force,
the
last
line
in
april
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
it
did.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct
and
you
(voice

debate
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
page
18a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
the
bottom
of
page
of
17a,
article
xvii.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
agreement
provides
specifically,
first,
that
the
united
states
should
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
in
addition,
that
it
shall
have
the
right
to
waive
any
jurisdiction.
then
the
agreement
also
commits
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
signing
of
the
agreement
to
give
to
japan
at
its
request
whatever
we
do
in
regard
to
the
nato's
--
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
when
--
when
that
is
completed.
so
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
were
given
due
notice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
when
the
motion
was
under
jenner,
it
came
up.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
article
xvii
and
on
page
18a,
in
paragraph
2.
it
was
made
clear
that
the
--
that
the
united
states
was
already
committed
by
this
agreement
to
give
japan,
at
its
request,
the
benefits
of
the
status
of
forces
agreement
when
those
were
consummated.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
such
jurisdiction
may
in
any
case
be
waived
by
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
the
--
the
base
in
concerning
the
jenner
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
resolution
or
motion,
senator
sparkman
sought
to
answer
that
motion.
and
in
his
elaboration
and
he
proceeded
to
say,
described
the
criminal
jurisdiction
that
would
be
involved
that
under
the
administrative
agreement,
we
would
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
the
right
to
waive
but
we
would
have
the
duty
and
the
obligation
already
committed
by
the
administrative
agreement
to
proceed
to
give
japan
at
its
request
the
benefit
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement,
whatever
that
was
when
it
finally
was
-that
applied
and
acted
upon
by
the.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
he
--
senator
sparkman
proceeded
to
describe
the
fact
that
there
would
be
the
problem
with
the
criminal
jurisdiction
and
that
it
was
best
handled
by
administrative
agreement
rather
than
having
it
come
back
to
the
senate.
so
that
if
the
senate
was
put
on
due
notice
that's
set
out
in
--
on
page
46
and
footnote
17,
the
--
a
portion
of
senator
sparkman's
discussion
with
the
matter.
so,
the
senate
had
full
notice
of
the
nature
of
the
administrative
agreement.
in
fact,
that
it
gave
exclusive
jurisdiction
during
the
interim,
that
it
provided
for
a
waiver,
complete
waiver
and
that
the
government
was
already
committed
by
that
agreement
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
it
"the
administrative
agreement
sitting
before
the
senate
at
that
time
showed
them
and
completely,
exactly
what
it
was."
they
had
the
whole
thing
there
before
them.
it
was
considered
in
the
committee
as
is
shown
by
our
brief.
and
it
was
also
considered
in
connection
with
this
motion.
and
so,
they
knew
that
on
the
question
of
the
conditions
as
to
disposition
of
truth.
it
isn't
just
disposition
of
conditions.
that
it
included
not
only
criminal
jurisdiction
but
taxation,
the
use
of
electric
power,
maneuver
areas
and
many
other
considerations
that
had
to
be
covered
in
order
to
handle
problems
of
that
character.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
had
been
signed
and
sent
to
the
senate
not
yet
since
to
the
senate,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
my
recollection
was
in
1953.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
there
was
a
discussion
at
that
time
of
the
effect
that
we
were
committed
to
japan
and
would
have
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
it
if
they
would
request
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
the
senate
had
full
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
then
we
have
to
--
in
order
to
get
the
complete
steps,
we
have
to
go
to
the
protocol,
which
was
executed
at
the
request
of
japan
as
we
had
already
agreed
and
were
committed
by
the
administrative
agreement,
which
gave
them
the
benefit
of
the
same
provisions
of
the
status
of
forces
agreement.
we
have
such
agreements
with
over
49
different
countries
throughout
the
world.
and
japan
got
exactly
the
same,
no
--
no
less
and
no
more
than
all
of
the
other
nato
countries
in
connection
with
this
protocol.
then
we
get
down
to
the
provisions
of
a
protocol
carrying
this
particular
matter.
and
that
is
set
at
--
set
forth
on
pages
24a
and
25a.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
we
feel
--
the
government
feels
that
the
united
states
was
committed
and
that
the
senate
had
this
before
in
the
administrative
agreement
at
--
and
the
security
treaty
so
that
it
knew
that
it
was
committed
by
those
instruments
to
give
the
benefit
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
to
japan
whenever
that
came
into
effect.
and
it
was
also
called
to
the
attention
of
the
--
the
senate
at
the
time
that
they
acted
upon
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
that
they
were
already
committed
to
give
the
same
thing
in
a
--
to
japan.
so,
they
had
full
knowledge
about
both
of
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
we
take
the
position
that
without
any
agreements
whatsoever,
japan
would
be
able
to
prosecute.
and
there
were
two
british
sailors
that
they
proceeded
to
prosecute
against
the
objection
of
britain.
so,
they
asserted
that
they
would
recognize
no
immunity
under
the
law
or
from
their
law.
and
without
any
security
treaty,
administrative
agreement
or
protocol,
they
could
proceed
to
prosecute
by
reason
of
international
law
because
there
would
be
no
immunity.
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
we
could
make
that
argument.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
we
don't
--
we
are
unwilling
to
concede
it
to
anybody
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
would
still
be
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
then
the
security
treaty
and
the
administrative
agreement
gave
the
united
states
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
the
right
to
waive
so
it
could
have
acted
just
as
it
was
done
here
under
that
waiver.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
then
after
the
protocol
came
into
effect,
it
went
further
insofar
as
the
united
states
was
concerned.
the
government
does
not
recognize
that
the
respondent
had
a
right
as
to
whether
or
not
the
united
states
would
exercise
jurisdiction
or
waive
jurisdiction.
that
is
a
right
that
belongs
to
the
state
and
so
recognized
under
the
decisions.
but
the
state
gained
the
benefit
under
the
protocol
of
the
right
to
--
to
have
a
primary
jurisdiction
in
certain
situations
and
to
decline
jurisdiction
and
to
waive
jurisdiction.
and
the
--
in
this
case,
the
government
has,
after
considering
all
of
the
facts,
decided
to
exercise
this
right
to
decline
jurisdiction
under
section
3
(c)
and
proceed
to
notify
japan
and
that
is
the
act
in
question.
and
there's
a
--
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
court
--
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
it
will
not
review
that
action
if
it
finds
that
there
is
a
discretion
in
the
executive
to
exercise,
that
it
will
not
proceed
to
review
it
and
determine
whether
it
should
have
been
decided
one
way
or
another
because
it
has
not
considered
the
court
competent
to
pass
upon
those
various
questions
of
foreign
relations.
the
executive
had
to
review
this
particular
situation,
the
problems
as
to
this
respondent,
the
fact
that
japan
had
waived
in
some
97.5%
of
all
of
these
cases.
that
we
have
secured
waivers
in
72%
of
some
3200
cases
over
a
period
of
three
years
from
all
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
countries
including
japan.
and
the
effect
on
the
foreign
relations
of
this
country
and
japan,
all
of
those
factors
and
the
knowledge
that
the
executive
had
--
had
to
come
into
play
and
be
considered
in
determining
whether
to
define
jurisdiction
or
to
waive
jurisdiction.
and
since
it
was
a
sovereign
right
that
belonged
to
the
state,
the
executive
proceeded
to
exercise
it
on
behalf
of
the
best
interest
of
the
state.
and
we
think
that
there
could
be
no
abusive
discretion
here.
that
there's
a
reasonable
action.
and
it
was
a
--a
right
of
the
state
and
--
and
the
executive
proceeded
to
exercise
it.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
make
it
very
clear
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
regarding
to
the
treaty
of
peace
with
japan.
it's
on
5a
of
the
government's
brief
and
in
that
treaty
in
article
i,
chapter
1,
subparagraph
(b),
the
united
states
government
and
the
allied
powers
recognized
the
full
sovereignty
of
the
japanese
people
over
japan
and
its
territorial
waters.
in
that
act
or
in
that
same
treaty,
we
agreed
that
we
would
withdraw
our
forces
within
90
days,
so
that
we
recognize
the
complete
sovereignty
of
japan
the
moment
that
treaty
was
signed
and
ratified
to
all
of
japan
and
its
territorial
waters
and
we
don't
claim
any
impingement
upon
that
agreement
whatsoever.
now,
we
did
agree
within
90
days,
we
would
withdraw
our
forces
and
then
we
had
the
security
treaty,
which
permitted
us
to
leave
forces
under
the
terms
of
that
treaty
order.
if
we
didn't
have
that
treaty,
we
wouldn't
have
been
permitted
to
leave
those
forces
under
the
terms
of
that
agreement
and
then,
the
administrative
agreement
that
was
made
under
which
provided
in
greater
detail.
next,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
case,
the
canadian
case
that
was
referred
to
and
is
reported
in
4
dominion
law
reports
at
page
11.
it
was
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
canada
in
the
nature
of
an
advisory
opinion,
this
court
was
not
rendered,
but
the
court
did
not
accept
the
position
advocated
by
the
united
states
in
the
brief
that
it
tendered
to
the
court.
there
was
a
divided
court
and
the
decision
was
three
to
two
against
the
position
of
the
government.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
read
the
syllabi
of
the
court
because
it
shows
the
thinking
of
the
court
and
if
the
court
--
if
this
court
cares
to
go
into
it,
you
will
find
a
number
of
authorities
that
the
government
deals
with
and
the
position
that
the
canadian
court
took
and
what
it
relied
on,
how
it
examined
this
entire
subject
and
felt
that
the
whole
idea
of
immunity
of
foreign
force
was
an
imposition
or
a
reduction
of
the
sovereignty
in
contrary
to
the
idea
of
control
of
such
matters
and
prosecution
for
criminal
offenses
by
the
country
in
which
the
--
such
forces
were
located.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
have
been
advised
there
wasn't
any
formal
appearance
at
all
but
the
united
states
submitted
a
memorandum
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
i
also
was
advised
that
it
was
not
done
by
the
department
of
justice,
although,
i'm
not
sure
just
how
it
was
handled.
but
in
--
i
think
that
the
correct
characterization
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
heard
that
it
was
the
department
of
state
that
submitted
it
and
i
think
the
correct
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
does
not.
the
correct
characterization
of
it
was
that
it
was
an
advocate's
brief
that
was
a
position
that
had
been
taken
by
the
united
states
in
various
efforts
to
get
better
terms
in
regard
to
agreements
concerning
immunity
and
it
was
not
accepted
in
this
court.
it
never
been
accepted
by
any
nation
in
the
world
up
to
date
that
we've
been
able
to
find.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases
that
international
law
is
not
merely
what
the
writers
may
say
it
ought
to
be,
but
its
not
--
and
it's
what
the
law
is,
what
you
can
find
from
the
decisions
and
also
what
the
practice
it
is
amongst
the
nations
of
the
world
and
that's
how
this
court
determines
what
international
law
is
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
on
how
much
you
theorize
about
what
immunity
you
have
from
the
law
--
criminal
law
of
another
country
if
you
can't
persuade
that
country
that
that
is
the
law.
you
aren't
going
to
get
very
far
with
that
kind
of
a
theory.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
they
were
not
willing
to
extend
that
to
canada
as
to
the
united
states
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
one
of
the
justice
of
the
court.
he
said
that
we're
involved
in
one
of
their
nationals,
there
is
certainly
would
be
no
immunity
even
though
they
would
recognize
it
as
between
the
united
states'
own
people
on
the
basis,
so
that
was
the
position
that
the
--
the
court
took.
now,
both
sides
have
cited
louder
parts,
treaties
on
oppenheim's
international
law,
but
we
have
cited
the
eighth
edition
in
our
brief
on
page
25
and
the
opposing
counsel
have
cited
the
seventh
edition.
i
don't
how
it
happened
that
it
was
handled
in
this
manner
by
a
lot
of
facts,
but
if
you
turn
from
the
place
where
he
recites
what
is
cited
by
counsel
for
the
respondent,
in
the
seventh
edition
some
48
pages
later.
in
the
eighth
edition,
you'll
find
the
following
language.
however,
the
view
which
has
the
support
of
the
bulk
of
practice
is
that
in
principle,
members
of
visiting
forces
are
subject
to
a
criminal
jurisdiction
of
local
courts
and
that
any
derogations
from
that
principle
require
specific
agreement
of
the
local
state
by
figure
or
otherwise.
now,
it's
generally
recognized
that
the
executive
has
the
authority
in
regard
to
diplomatic
immunity,
one
of
the
examples
that
counsels
cited,
to
waive
them
that
in
this
clear
exchange
case
that
chief
justice
marshall
has
discusses
the
fact
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
problem
is
the
representing
of
the
sovereign,
its
diplomatic
representative.
and
generally,
he
is
immune
from
the
criminal
laws
of
a
country,
which
he
attends,
but
that
is
subject
to
waiver
and
this
court
has
held
in
several
cases
and
in
the
case
--
the
kent
case.
the
united
states
did
waive
it
and
permitted
kent
to
be
tried
by
the
british
courts
in
regard
to
certain
secret
documents
that
they
claimed
to
have
been
stolen
and
this,
the
court
denied
his
application
for
consideration
of
that
case.
and
in
the
area
of
extradition,
the
court
has
recognized
the
discretion
of
the
state
to
decide,
plan
the
person
charged
should
be
delivered
up
and
it's
entirely
within
the
discretion
of
the
executive
to
make
that
decision
and
the
court
has
so
recognized.
we
do
have
an
extradition
treaty
with
japan
that
we
have
had
for
some
17
years
and
under
all
of
those
principles,
which
we
think
are
comparable,
there
would
be
a
discretionary
authority
in
the
executive
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
act
--
for
the
government
to
act
or
to
permit
the
other
country
to
the
same
situations
dealt
with
and
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
regard
to
the
attorney
general's
power
to
deliver
up
a
prisoner
who
is
held
in
a
federal
penitentiary
for
state
prosecution.
and
as
a
matter
for
his
discretion,
even
though
there
is
no
statute
concerning,
that
he
can
exercise
that
discretion
and
deliver
the
man
up
so
he
can
be
prosecuted
under
the
state
offense
and
that
that
penalty
shall
be
--
shall
follow
whatever
action
he
has
been
--
whatever
action
has
been
imposed
upon
him
for
the
federal
offense
so
that
the
whole
area
of
this
discretionary
authority
of
the
state
in
regard
to
these
problems
have
been
recognized
by
the
court
and
applied.
now,
there
was
a
question
in
regard
to
how
many
waivers
had
occurred
with
japanese
--
with
japan
and
the
character
of
those
waivers.
the
government
was
asked
if
it
would
supply
information
to
counsel
for
the
respond
in
regard
to
this
and
we
made
an
effort
just
to
see
if
it
could
be
supplied
and
we
found
that
the
information
was
not
in
a
form
that
it
could
possibly
be
--
be
supplied
with
any
--
any
reasonable
period
of
time
because
it
would
mean
going
back
to
every
soldier's
file
and
try
to
find
out
any
one
that
had
--
any
record
of
being
charged
and
try
to
find
out
just
what
happened
in
his
particular
case.
and
with
5400
cases
within
one
year,
it
was
quite
impossible
to
do.
so
the
best
that
we
can
do
is
refer
to
the
annual
report
to
the
senate
armed
services
committee
on
the
exercise
of
the
criminal
jurisdiction
over
united
states
service
personnel
by
foreign
courts,
december
1,
1955
to
november
30,
1956
presented
by
george
w.
hickam
jr.,
major
general
of
united
states
army,
the
judge
advocate
general,
department
of
the
army,
and
this
is
in
a
hearing.
this
isn't
in
our
brief.
it
was
in
a
hearing
report
before
a
subcommittee
of
the
committee
on
armed
services,
united
states
senate
85th
congress
per
session
dated
april
9th,
1957.
it's
got
an
imprint
on
it,
91290,
maybe
of
any
assistance.
in
that
--
in
regard
to
japan,
on
page
37
with
a
notation
effective
since
october
28th
1953,
the
defense
department
describes
as
follows.
during
the
period
of
this
report,
there
were
5544
cases
involving
united
states
personnel
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
japanese
courts,
(3013
of
these
cases
were
traffic
violations).
japan
waived
its
jurisdiction
in
5409
or
97.56%
of
these
cases.
it
tried
111
cases.
these
trials
resulted
in
54
fines
only,
42
suspended
sentences
to
confinement
and
15
unsuspended
sentences
to
confinement.
there
is
no
further
delineation
of
the
character
of
their
offenses.
the
only
other
reference
that
i
care
to
make
is
in
regard
to
article
xiv
and
counsel
has
stated
to
the
court
that
applied
as
the
uniform
code
states
in
all
places.
the
language
is
this
chapter
applies
in
all
places.
in
article
xiv,
which
is
a
part
of
the
code,
shows
the
attitude
and
position
of
the
congress
in
regard
to
this
matter
and
the
civil
authorities
as
follows.
it
reads,
under
such
regulations
as
the
secretary
concerned
maybe
--
may
prescribe
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
accused
of
an
offense
against
civil
authority
may
be
delivered
upon
request
to
the
civil
authority
for
trial
so
that
if
the
court
cares
to
turn
to
that
for
authority,
it
seems
clear
what
the
attitude
of
the
congress
is
as
it
has
expressed.
and
in
adopting
article
xiv,
the
court
--
the
congress
expressly
removed
the
geographical
limitations
that
were
in
the
old
article
74
of
the
military
code.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
couldn't
say
except
i
don't
--
do
not
--
i'm
not
able
to
say
that
the
history
as
recited
here
to
the
court
by
response
counsel
is
not
correct
in
regard
to
that
and
it
seems
to
me
that
indicates
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
meet
a
situation
where
he
would
be
delivered
up
to
the
civil
government
in
germany
which
is
different
than
an
entirely
different
sovereigns
since
we
were
still
in
charge
of
that
civil
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
1950.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
a
great
surprise
to
me.
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
military
code
and
that
--
in
case
that
this
court
decided
that
he
should
not
be
prosecuted
under
law
of
japan
that
--
that
the
prosecution
would
be
followed
up
in
that
manner
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
but
i
have
not
made
any
inquiry
on
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
all.
