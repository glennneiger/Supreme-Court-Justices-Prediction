justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
objection
to
having
it
sealed
by
the
respondent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
objection
to
its
being
sealed
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
to
that
point
comes
before
(inaudible)
can
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
respondent
wholly
apart
from
the
--
the
legal
relevance
and
not
--
did
respondent
speak
to
raise
issues
of
fact
for
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
controversy
about
issue
of
the
fact
merely
as
to
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
admitted,
the
government
for
purpose
of
legal
questions,
admitted
the
issue
on
which
there
was
a
contest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
where
it
was
the
claim
of
the
united
states
if
they
had
primary
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
--
you
make
a
distinction
i
think
it's
between
a
soldier
and
officer
being
liable,
being
found
to
be
acting
within
the
course
of
his
duties.
and
the
government
of
the
united
states,
instructing
a
soldier
to
do
something
which
might
have
--
which
might
be,
to
say
the
least,
not
a
very
--
a
very
nice
thing
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
instruct
its
soldiers
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
single
liability
for
an
act
done
in
the
course
of
duty
is
very
different
from
saying
you
go
ahead
and
shoot
a
woman.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
discussed
the
conventional
question
of
law
of
agency
whether
a
man
is
--
whether
the
principal
is
responsible
or
whether
the
agent
is
on
a
frolic
of
his
own.
that's
all
this,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying,
if
i
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
on
this.
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
government
says
that
3a
--
3a-2
was
satisfied.
this
is
an
act
of
--
an
act
in
the
performance
of
official
duty.
that
you
admit
that,
for
purposes
of
the
legal
question
raised
by
such
an
admission
or
stipulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you
saying
that
non-constant,
it
doesn't
follow
that
assuming
that
a
tort
action
could
be
brought,
assuming
--
i
know
that
--
assuming
that
a
tort
action
could
be
brought
to
the
district
court
of
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
act.
i
know
i'm
making
an
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
government
could
take
the
position
by
way
of
defense
that
in
fact
the
government
is
not
liable.
that
this
so
far
traveled
out
of
the
responsibility
of
the
government
as
--
as
the
principal
of
this
soldier
that
under
(inaudible)
certain
laws
of
agency
and
tort,
the
government
would
not
be
liable.
is
that
the
line
you're
drawing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
the
chief
justice's
question
was
directed,
was
that
latter
fact.
and
he
explicitly
put
to
one
side
for
the
time
being
the
question
of
waiver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor
i
take
it
that
foreign
forces
--
foreign
friendly
forces
at
various
times
have
from
time
to
time
been
stationed,
for
all
i
know,
i
do
not
know
but
i
assume
are
stationed
now
in
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
any
arrangement
and
any
provisions,
any
light
to
be
shed
as
to
the
claims
we
make
regarding
offenses
by
foreign
forces
stationed
on
our
soil?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
same
limitation
about
in
the
performance
of
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
controversies
may
arise
as
they
arise
in
the
courts
of
law
all
the
time
as
to
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
in
the
performance
of
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
there's
a
conflict,
he
now
can
say,
canada,
others
from
canadian
troops
unless
it
is
classified
material.
i
never
know
when
anything
is
classified
in
this
[laughter].
is
that
classified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
canadians.
now,
is
there
--
may
there
be
a
conflict
between
a
commanding
officer
and
the
--
our
--
our
military
and
the
canadian
military
as
to
whether
an
act
is
or
isn't
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
is
that
resolved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
didn't
ask
the
canadian
troops
on
our
soils.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
as
to
--
as
to
the
executive
as
taking
its
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
the
same
situations
in
reference
to
these
canadian
soldiers
in
iowa?
suppose
this
kind
of
a
situation
arose
in
iowa.
would
the
same
--
the
same
kind
of
arrangements
govern
and
the
same
kind
of
decision
is
taken?
that
is,
canada
claimed
it
was
not
within
the
--
within
the
performance
--
as
in
the
performance
of
his
duty.
and
he
would
claim
it
was.
and
--
and
then
there
might
be
a
deadlock
between
--
within
the
committee
and
it
might
be
resolved
between
the
governments.
does
that
happen
as
to
canada,
the
same
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
the
court
comes
in,
in
case
there
is
a
trial
in
the
--
in
the
court.
the
court
would
also
then
go
into
this
question
whether
on
the
merits
as
it
were.
it
was
or
wasn't
in
the
performance
of
duty.
and
would
not
be
concluded
by
the
military
determination,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand
it
--
as
i
understand
it,
if
i
have
it
clearly.
you
say
that
with
reference
to
foreign
troops
canadian,
english,
french,
australian
or
what
not
stationed
in
this
country
the
same
kind
of
--
of
--
the
same
provisions
of
treaty
,protocol,
agreement,
et
cetera,
same
kind
of
machinery,
the
same
kind
of
determination
and
the
same
kind
of
relationship
between
the
two
governments,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
could
you
--
if
i
may
carry
on
the
chief
justice's
and
justice
brennan's
questions.
would
it
be
possible
between
now
and
the
time
this
argument
closes
to
have
had
from
the
department
of
defense
instances
that
specifically
answer
the
questions
put
to
you.
namely,
whether
charges
of
major
crimes
by
canadians,
where
they're
restricted
to
that,
by
canadians
stationed
on
our
soil
whether
in
such
a
case
the
question
has
arisen
in
which
we
saw
or
some
state,
this
could
normally
be
a
state
prosecution,
what's
--
in
which
some
state
of
the
union
asserted
its
local
jurisdiction
and
canada
invoked
her
interest
under
the
treaty
to
have
the
alleged
conflict
turned
over
to
its
authorities,
could
that
be
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
that
(inaudible)
is
apprehended?
did
i
understand
that
this
territory,
i'm
talking
about
the
geography,
was
not
an
exclusive
american
base
which
was
partly
shared
with
the
japanese?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
any
event
if
japan
forcibly
got
hold
of
an
american,
no
matter
how
he
got
there,
they
would
have
unquestioned
right
to
try
him
in
their
courts
because
we
have
held,
this
court
has
held
again
and
again
that
if
you
can
get
a
man
who
is
in
one
state
into
the
other
state
where
he
committed
the
crime,
it
doesn't
matter
that
he
was
--
as
if
were
kidnapped.
so
that
if
by
force,
japan
could
get
hold
of
an
american
who
commits
a
crime
in
japan,
diplomatically,
in
international
lawly
speaking,
we
would
have
no
case
against
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
say
is
that
to
avoid
these
forcible
encounters,
a
treaty
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean
they
had
before
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
was
laid
before
or
what,
the
whole
senate
or
the
committee
on
foreign
relations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
--
that
that's
the
agreement
under
which
all
this
is
--
that's
the
agreement
printed
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
the
treaty
when
the
treaty
was
ratified
by
the
senate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
march
20th.
the
--
the
administrative
agreement
i
gather
from
your
appendix
was
signed
at
tokyo,
march
20,
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
administrative
agreement
was
signed
at
tokyo
on
february
28th,
1952.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
it
was
entered
into
force,
april
28th,
1952.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
after
the
treaty
was
ratified
by
the
senate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
so,
what
you're
saying
is,
you
may
have
the
exact
date
for
all
i
know,
is
that
while
the
security
treaty
was
under
discussion
on
a
motion
or
appropriate
proceedings
for
ratifications,
this
administrative
agreement
signed
--
signed
so
far
as
the
government
of
united
states
and
the
government
of
japan
are
concerned,
it
was
completed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
before
the
senate
before
it
ratified
the
treaty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
further
suggest
that
in
connection
with
or
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
treaty,
a
proposal
was
made
by
senator
jenner,
i
think
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
--
with
a
view
to
providing
that
the
agreement
should
not
get
into
--
become
--
go
into
effect
until
the
senate
itself
formally
--
whatever
you
had
acted
upon,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
treaty
authorized
entering
into
an
administrative
agreement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
administrative
agreement
within
process
of
adoption
between
the
two
countries
in
japan.
it
was
adopted
between
the
two
countries.
it
was
made
before
the
senate.
it
was
sought
to
make
the
legal
--
the
legal
validity
of
that
agreement
contingent
upon
senate
action
and
the
senate
rejected
that
proposal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
state
of
the
negotiations
for
the
nato
agreement
at
the
time
that
reference
to
it
was
made
in
this
agreement,
roughly
that
it's
well
advanced.
that
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
--
subject
to
an
argument
by
us,
diplomatic
i
take
it,
that
they
were
certain
implied
implications
from
allowing
our
troops
down
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
--
i
just
want
to
be
meticulously
active
about
the
statement
you
made
subject
to
a
claim
that
there
was
an
implication
of
consent
to
have
us
try
by
a
court-martial
somebody
who
did
something
within
the
military
jurisdiction
of
this
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
provision
in
case
of
conflict
between
the
two
countries
about
which
there
are
conflicts
in
every
lower
court
in
the
united
states
practically
everyday
of
the
year
of
some
provision
in
case
of
conflict
about
the
facts.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
this
memorandum?
you
said
1955
and
1945
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1943.
this
was
during
the
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
1955
as
evidenced
was
the
date
of
the
publication
in
which
you
found
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
includes
the
president
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
supporting
this.
you
hit
too
hard
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
being
discourteous
to
the
officials
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
be
wrong
but
you
can
courteous
in
arguing
even
serious
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
canadian
government
accept
that
view
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
the
canadian
government
accept
that
view
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
decision
of
its
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
sure
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
a
good
place
to
find
out
what
a
court
decides.
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
1955
you
have
said
after
the
treaty
with
japan
of
1952,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
you're
reading
from
a
document
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
evidently
dated
if
i
followed
you,
as
i've
tried
hard
to,
in
1955,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
1955,
some
congressman
put
in
views,
which
are
in
direct
conflict
with
the
treaty
with
japan
of
few
years
earlier,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
by
that
time
that
this
treaty
which
you
are
to
discuss
it
before
us
and
that
was
then
in
existence,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
there
was
a
treaty
which
referred
--
which
authorized
the
making
of
a
--
an
executive
agreement,
a
joint
agreement
which
was
before
the
congress,
in
the
senate
when
it
ratified
the
treaty.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
reading
of
document,
which
somebody
put
in,
did
not
yet
had
his
name,
with
somebody
put
in,
in
1955
to
give
expression
to
views
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
treaty
adopted
by
this
--
ratified
by
the
senate
a
few
years
earlier,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
put
me
straight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
these
--
that's
what
these
treaties
--
that's
what
the
nato
treaty
and
the
agreement,
which
we
have
before
us
permits.
and
under
which
we
are
told
97.5%
of
the
cases
that
have
arisen
in
japan
have
been
so
turned
over
at
our
request.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
president
was
not
only
--
was
not
only
telling
his
history
but
he
was
indulging
in
verified
prophecy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
the
question
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question
--
i
don't
understand
that.
as
i
understand
that,
i
am
subject
to
correction,
i
know
nothing
except
what
i
hear
and
--
and
read.
as
i
understand
it,
in
97.5%
percent
of
the
cases
when
we
asked
japan
to
turnover
people
who
might
be
subject
to
their
jurisdiction,
they
consented.
and
i
don't
have
to
see
what
the
point
is
of
saying
you
want
to
know
what
we
did
with
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--the
question
is
with
japan
--
japan
surrendered
her
authority.
that's
the
vital
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
speaking
--
are
you
speaking
by
the
book
or
the
(inaudible)
are
those
--
is
that
statement
of
yours
verifiable
by
the
instances
or
is
this
just
a
surmise
of
yours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
should
think
the
government
would
be
able
to
tell
this
court
whether
97.5%
of
--
of
those
that
in
which
that
japan
waived
what
she
was
entitled
to
try
were
automobile
cases.
that
ought
not
to
be
too
difficult
to
ascertain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
long
as
that
a
vast
majority?
that's
shaving
if
you
are
honest
with
it.
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
didn't
have
those
grievance
if
such
should
be
against
this
country
for
not
enforcing
the
law
of
an
authority
then
if
japan
and
97.5%
of
the
cases
in
which
we
requested
that
they
turn
over
those
accused
of
wrongdoing
were
turned
over.
the
fact
is
that
japan
and
97.5%
of
the
cases,
they've
turned
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
depends
on
your
argument.
i
can
understand
the
--
to
proposition
to
the
last
event.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
you
who
made
the
argument
that
these
people
are
being
cruelly
treated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
backward
countries
of
france
and
great
britain
and
japan.
that
was
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
think
it's
very
desirable,
needlessly,
to
reflect

their

in
many
respects
are
not
inferior
to
our
own.

ago,

history
of
other

of
our
civilization.
justice
felix

do
you
think
any
member
of
this
court
doesn't
agree
to
the
proposition
that
nobody
can
be
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights?
do
you
think
any
member
of
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
needs
to
be
instructed
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
what
are
our
constitutional
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
did
that
decide?
would
you
state
what
that
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
not
a
court
opinion.
it's
important
to
be
accurate
to
these
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
therefore,
i
ask
you
what
the
decision
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
--
they
specifically
did
not
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
the
administrative
agreement,
they
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
also
said
such
jurisdiction
made
in
any
case
be
waived
by
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
they
qualified
and
part
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
may
be
waived
is
something
else
than
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that's
the
subject
to
which
i
think
that
justice
black
in
part
of
it
asked
you
to
address
yourself.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
if
one
is
restricted
to
the
administrative
agreement
that
if
the
united
states
exclusive
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
to
qualify
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
it
is
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
supposed
to
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
inside
knowledge,
except
for
the
documents
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
a
soldier
--
if
a
soldier
commits
a
crime
in
germany
while
in
--
in
germany
and
then
comes
back
to
the
united
states,
can
the
united
states
extradite
him
to
germany
even
without
an
extradition
treaty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
come
up
in
several
cases,
come
up
again
and
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
on
the
fact
of
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
--
the
famous
factory
case
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
can
he
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
settled
very
early
in
this
country's
history
in
the
case
that
it
was
much
debated
in
the
house
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
representative
and
senate,
the
famous
robbins
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
the
claim
of
jury
trial
and
all
the
rest
of
it
even
without
an
extradition
treaty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
whole
argument
thus
far
was
that
he
must
be
tried
by
court-martial,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
neither
--
neither
japan
nor
the
united
states
has
--
has
any
means
of
trying
him
for
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
subject
to
court-martial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
even
if
you're
right
thus
far,
he
must
be
released
at
once
without
giving
the
american
military
authorities
an
opportunity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
hold
him
in
jurisdictionally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
--
that's
what
surrender
would
mean
necessarily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
can't
be
detained
until
an
appropriate
military
proceeding
is
started.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
the
cases
are
against
him.
but
take
all
the
immigration
cases,
which
have
held
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
question
is
habeas
corpus,
whether,
even
if
the
detention
is
illegal.
there
must
be
immediate
surrender
or
whether
this
court
can
deal
with
the
matter
according
to
right
of
justice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
say
in
due
course
you
can
--
if
in
due
course
you
bring
proper
proceedings,
you
may
do
so
and
you
don't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
make
the
matter
at
large.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
the
district
court
has
done.
it's
given
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
given
a
declaration
of
right,
which
if
sustained
makes
clear
that
he
can't
be
surrendered
to
japan
and
therefore,
it
must
appropriately
be
dealt
with
by
american
authorities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suggest
you
deal
with
the
case
of
mahler
against
eby
in
264
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
writ
wasn't
issued
according
to
your
own
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
according
to
your
statement
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
we
need
an
issue
because
the
attorney
general
will
take
appropriate
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suggest
you
look
at
mahler
against
eby
in
264
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
on
this
--
on
this
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
day,
before
--
before
two
senators,
whoever
they
were,
senator
ervin
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
there
any
definition
in
the
administrative
agreement
or
in
the
nato
agreement
as
to
what
official
duty
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
how
can
it
--
how
can
it
contradict
what's
--
what's
not
defined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
i
would
like
to
renew
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
please
--
let
me
put
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
whether
official
duty
was
defined
by
the
underlying
documents
and
you
say
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
been
defined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
it
define
it
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
what
--
where
is
that
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
renew
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
question
to
you.
does
--
is
there
anything
in
the
protocol
that
defined
the
phrase
in
the
performance
of
official
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
then.
then
--
then
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you,
is
that
the
phrase
in
the
performance
of
official
duty
as
such
technical
define
closed
meaning
that
the
protocol
elaboration
of
it
is
in
defiance
of
it.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
doesn't
contradict
it
unless
you
say
official
duty
is
so
self-defining
that
the
committee
can't
define
it
more
particularly.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
i
can
go
to
some
book
where
i
can
find
--
where
i
can
find
the
definition
of
official
duty
that
will
satisfy
every
lawyer
and
every
judge,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
find
hundreds
of
cases
which
there
are
conflict
of
application
of
that
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
can
this
committee
--
can't
this
committee
then--
being
an
agency
for
taking
care
of
conflicts
define
more
particularly
what
is
generally
defined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
we
ought
independently
here,
as
though
we
were
sitting
at
a
--
at
a
trial
court
charging
a
jury,
define
what
official
duty
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand
you,
this
was
an
agreed
meaning
between
american
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
than
japanese.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carroll,
it
is
agreed
by
the
solicitor
general.
it
is
agreed
that
the
position
of
this
government
is
that
this
man
was
on
official
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
they
agree
with
you
that
this
was
within
the
most
technical
definition
that
you
can
give
to
official
duty
and,
nevertheless,
this
government
exercised
its
duty
or
its
right
of
waiver.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
matter
if
this
government
concedes
your
point
and
says,
“nevertheless,
it
has
authority.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
cases
that
they
deal
with
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
questions
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
i
know
rights
is
the
most
--
the
most
traitorous
of
all.
what
do
you
mean
by
the
same
rights?
i
want
to
know
whether
these
are
cases
in
which
an
--
in
the
first
place,
these
are
--
when
you
say
a
treaty
of
peace,
these
are
an
occupying
--
an
occupying
country
or
a
conquering
country
has
criminal
jurisdiction
after
the
treaty
of
peace
of
crimes
committed
on
the
--
on
part
of
a
territory
of
the
defeated
belligerent
on
the
soil
of
which
it
happens
to
have
soldiers,
any
of
those
cases
of
that
sort?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
the
agreement
which
you
read
from
mr.
dechert's
affidavit
shows
that
they
have
to
make
an
arrangement
toward
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
can
keep
something
they
had
but
they
got
something
they
didn't
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
the
administrative
agreement
carrying
out
a
treaty
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
senate
could
be
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
arrangement
for
determining
when
there
is
conflict
who
should
see
what
right
he
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
in
the
--
i
have
the
other
form
of
the
report
and
i
do
not
notice
in
the
appearances
that
united
states
appeared
before
the
supreme
court
of
canada.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
or
two,
three,
four,
five,
six
appearances
for
different
parties
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
not
for
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
reference
to
it
in
any
of
the
judgments
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
--
that's
what
struck
me
that
it
--
saying
if
united
states
made
a
representation
before
the
supreme
court
of
canada,
no
appearance,
no
reference
should
be
made,
no
--
there
should
be
no
specific
appearances
and
no
reference
in
any
of
their
judgments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
interrupted
you
when
you
started
to
tell
the
court
what
the
--
what
the
rulings
were
if
you
permit
me
to
say
so
and
you
agreed
that
one
thing
they
all
agreed
on
was
chief
justice
marshall's
opinion
with
which
the
chief
justice
read
before
lunch
and
they
all
agreed
that
there's
an
implied
consent
ahead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
the
change,
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
950?
