mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
it
is
with
deep
respect
and
humility
that
i
speak
for
the
men
and
women
in
the
armed
services
of
the
united
states
overseas
and
for
those
of
us
at
home
who
live
at
this
sellout
program
whereby
the
constitutional
rights
of
american
soldiers
overseas
are
stripped
from
them
is
wrong.
it
is
these
men
on
whom
this
nation
relies
for
its
security,
for
its
honor
and
for
the
respective
place,
which
this
nation
has
in
the
family
of
nations.
directly
involved
is
the
person
of
a
humble
citizen
born
in
illinois
because
this
court
well
knows
the
issues
in
this
case
probe
deeper
and
the
question
here
to
be
established
will
determine
the
course
that
this
nation
will
follow
for
a
long
time
to
come.
this
court
recognized
the
importance
of
the
question
by
calling
this
special
session.
upon
the
right,
record
of
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
of
fact.
they
were
stipulated
in
the
court
below.
they
are
very
simple.
an
18-year
old
boy
born
not
far
at
all
from
the
birthplace
of
abraham
lincoln,
volunteered
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces
of
this
nation,
wherever
deemed
necessary.
although,
he
was
uneducated,
the
spirit
of
freedom
and
the
realization
of
the
dangers
confronted
this
(inaudible)
without
caused
him
to
don
the
uniform
of
the
american
soldier
of
which
he
is
justly
proud.
he
is
not
militaristic.
he
did
what
many
of
the
youth
of
this
nation
have
done
before
him.
he
desired
to
do
his
best,
return
to
his
home
in
hopes
that
upon
return,
it
may
be
more
secure
and
that
he
may
live
a
more
abundant
life.
at
the
end
of
his
three-year
term,
conditions
being
what
they
are,
he
volunteered
for
an
additional
term.
and
the
duty
which
was
assigned
him
was
not
the
easy
task.
he
was
the
foot
soldier
carrying
the
gun
and
the
other
instruments
of
destruction.
during
his
second
term
of
enlistment
and
on
january
30th,
1957,
after
a
morning
of
target
practice
and
sweat,
he
was
ordered
to
guard
american
property
on
an
american
firing
range
known
as
camp
weir.
trespassers
came
on
to
serve
their
own
purposes.
he
fired
an
empty
shell
to
scare
them
off,
not
to
kill.
and
unfortunately,
that
act
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
japanese
national.
our
government,
being
fully
competent
and
equipped
to
judge
on
our
standards,
and
i
stress
on
our
standards,
thus
it's
a
very
material
issue
in
this
case,
whether
he
acted
rightfully
or
wrongfully,
then
decided
to
let
the
japanese
court
pass
judgment
on
this
situation.
admittedly,
none
of
the
constitutional
safeguards
which
he
would
have
or
which
he
has
as
american
citizen
though
worthy
to
be
tried
before
an
american
court
would
be
carried
forward
with
him.
i
note
that
--
that
the
solicitor
general
has
been
eloquently
silent
on
the
subject
of
the
type
of
trial
he
would
receive
and
what
would
happen
to
this
boy
before
the
japanese
court,
who
according
to
the
press,
have
been
clamoring
to
have
him
brought
before
them
for
justice
as
they
understand
it
and
in
accordance
with
their
system
and
under
their
code
which
an
american
lawyer
practicing
in
germany
has
declared
is
an
absolute
joke
and
one
of
the
most
antiquated
systems
of
--
of
justice
that
exist
in
any
nation
of
this
world,
including
some
of
the
arab
countries.
now,
how
did
this
all
come
about?
and
by
what
method
did
the
united
states,
acting
through
the
executive,
turn
this
boy
or
agree
to
turn
this
boy
over
to
the
japanese
government
to
stand
trial
on
their
system
of
law?
and
what
is
the
historical
background?
it
started
in
this
fashion.
before
the
termination
of
world
war
i,
the
united
states
exercised
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
its
troops
in
every
country
of
the
world.
despite
the
statements
by
the
solicitor
of
the
contrary,
the
fact
remains
that
the
united
states
exercised
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
its
troops
wherever
they
were
stationed.
that
is
the
law.
that
has
been
the
international
law.
it
has
been
recognized
from
time
immemorial.
and
on
the
subject
of
immunity
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
there
was
no
difference,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
--
on
that
subject
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
will
in
just
one
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
there
were
not.
there
was
the
international
law.
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
one
moment.
and
while
the
subject
matter
of
the
immunity
from
foreign
jurisdiction
both
--
both
personal
and
territorial
was
to
be
taken
up
by
mr.
carroll
and
he
will
go
into
that
thoroughly,
i
want
to
make
a
few
brief
comments
on
that
subject
in
passing
since
your
honor
raises
the
issue.
as
we
well
know,
international
law
does
not
change
overnight
or
within
a
few
years
or
because
of
views
entertained
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
attorney
general
or
some
underlings
working
in
the
state
department.
let
me
tell
you,
your
honors,
what
the
united
states
position
was,
only
three
and
a
half
to
four
years
before
we
had
this
complete
turnabout.
and
it
appears
in
the
congressional
record,
a
hearing
before
the
house
of
representatives
had
on
july
26th,
1935.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
this
is
something
your
--
your
honor
must
know
we
burned
the
midnight
oil
until
dawn.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
and
this
is
one
thing
i
only
uncovered
the
last
day
or
so.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
not
referring
to
a
citation.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
your
honor,
i
will.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
reading
from
the
brief,
which
was
submitted
by
the
united
--
i'm
not
reading
from
them.
i'm
just
going
to
give
you
one
of
the
text
of
it,
a
brief
which
the
united
states
government
gave
to
the
canadian
supreme
court
on
this
question
of
immunity
from
foreign
jurisdiction.
and
these
were
the
facts.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it
appears,
your
honor,
beginning
at
page
404
of
the
hearings
on
h.j.res.309,
part
1.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
res.309.
and
the
dates
on
the
bottom
are
july
13th,
14th,
19th,
20th,
21st
and
26th.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
they're
1955.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
1955,
yes,
sir.
the
law
up
to
that
point
had
always
been
clear
and
insofar
as
we
know
it
still
is
clear.
but
this
is
what
happened
in
this
canadian
situation.
the
canadian
government
was
confronted
with
a
large
number
of
american
forces
on
their
territory.
it
was
not
conquered
territory.
it
is
our
neighbor,
our
friendly
neighbor
and
a
country
whose
laws
are
more
nearly
akin
to
ours
than
any
in
the
world.
and
our
today,
armed
forces
is
a
naturally
--
it
would
be
on
bill
of
actions.
that'd
be
events
that
would
give
rise
to
crime.
and
the
issue
was
before
the
canadian
parliament
as
to
whether
or
not
they
may
make
a
law
which
would
deprive
our
forces
in
canada
of
the
immunity
which
they
enjoyed
under
the
recognized
principle
of
international
law.
and
the
case
--
the
problem
was
submitted
to
the
highest
court
of
canada.
i
don't
know
the
title
of
the
court.
and
the
--
the
attorney
general,
and
as
far
as
i
really
must
write
it
quickly.
then
i
know
the
chief
justice
of
that
court
asked
for
a
memorandum
on
the
subject
from
the
united
states.
and
we
submitted
a
memorandum.
it
was
either
1944
or
1945
or
somewhere
in
that
year,
just
a
few
years
before
this
turnabout
came.
and
the
memorandum
--
in
the
covering
letter
which
came
from
obligation
to
the
--
to
the
highest
court
of
canada,
this
is
the
position
which
our
government
then
took,
“i
have
the
honor
to
enclose
for
such
purposes
you
may
care
to
make,
a
memorandum
which
sets
forth
the
views
of
the
united
states
government
on
the
right
under
international
law
of
the
members
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
on
canadian
territory
with
the
consent
of
the
canadian
government,
to
immunity
from
local
jurisdiction
and
criminal
matters.”
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
i
read
it
correctly.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
sorry
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
exact
date
of
the
transcript
of
letter
was
may
27th,
1943.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
this
was
during
the
war.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
it
came
to
light,
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
only
upon
my
getting
the
chance
after
working
on
this
brief
under
much
pressure
to
read
some
of
these
congressional
hearings
and
i
may
say
in
passing.
they
are
rich
with
information,
which
is
directly
contrary.
i
don't
like
to
say
it
but
it's
a
fact,
directly
contrary
to
the
information
which
my
adversary
has
been
given
to
this
court
today.
not
only
contrary.
senators
have
stated
in
--
in
other
congressional
hearings
that
information
which
mr.
rankin
has
given
and
which
other
high
government
officials
has
given.
i
don't
like
to
say
it,
but
it's
a
fact
that
it
was
false,
untrue
and
misleading.
and
i
will
get
to
that
subject
in
just
a
few
moments.
this
--
and
i
only
want
to
quote
from
a
few
extracts
of
this
brief
and
then
see
what
happens
from
that
point
on
when
you
wanted
to
serve
some
selfish
purpose
of
some
small
man
in
the
state
department
selling
out
on
jurisdiction,
they
had
to
reverse
the
rule
to
suit
their
own
purposes.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir,
i
said
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
the
small
boy
in
state
department.
it
does
not
include
the
president
of
the
united
states.
[laughs]
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
understand
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
have
no
intentions
of
being
discourteous
to
the
president
of
the
united
states,
but
he
too
may
be
wrong,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
very
well,
sir.
quote
on
page
405
of
the
congressional
record."
one
of
these
rules
recognized
immunity
from
local
jurisdiction
in
criminal
matters
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
sovereignty
on
the
territory
with
mission
or
by
the
consent
of
the
local
sovereign."
they
cite
many,
many
cases
and
then
make
this
concluding
statement.
this,
mind
you,
is
a
brief
that
the
united
states.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
pled
by
justice
or
the
judge.
(inaudible)
but
either
one
i
do
know
that
during
the
war
days
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
there
was
liaison
between
the
justice
department
and
the
judge
advocate's
department.
and
i
think
at
that
time
mr.
justice
clark
was
the
attorney
general.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
1945?
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
to
which
i
blame
this
on
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
but
there
was
liaison
because
i
personally
was
in
the
war
department
in
washington
at
that
time
and
i
moved
many
times
to
the
justice
department
to
clear
on
some
of
these
memorandums
that
had
to
deal
with
international
properties.
in
any
event,
it
was
represented
to
be
the
views
of
the
united
states
when
it
was
sent
to
the
high
court
of
canada.
“the
authorities
whom
we
have
quoted
and
others
who
will
be
referred
to
here
and
after
unqualifiedly
recognized
the
right
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
state
on
the
territory
with
the
permission
or
consent
of
the
local
sovereign
to
immunity
from
local
jurisdiction
for
any
offense
they
commit.”
this
is
nowadays
the
opinion
of
the
vast
majority
of
writers
on
international
law.
they
then
go
on
to
say
there
are
a
few
dissenting
voices
and
they
point
out
--
they
say
first
these
dissenting
voices
are,
one,
they're
against
the
weight,
the
decided
weight
of
authority.
two,
they
are
too
vague
and
indefinite
to
be
considered
rules
of
law.
three,
they
are
contrary
to
the
principles
on
which
immunity
from
local
jurisdiction
for
the
forces
is
based.
and
there's
a
--
there's
a
fourth
reason
that
they
criticized
the
dissent.
four,
they
are
not
expresses.
they
are
not
expressive
of
the
international
practice.
and
i'll
agree
to
the
canadian
court
concluded
with
the
statement
that
there
was
absolute
immunity
under
international
law
recognizing
from
time
immemorial
of
the
visiting
force
upon
the
sovereign
territory
of
another
nation
whether
they
are
in
there
by
consent
or
by
force.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
this
--
this
is
a
brief.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
your
honor's
question.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
and
this
is
the
--
there
--
there
are
wholly
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
almost
they're
cited
in
the
brief.
there
are
many
of
them
cited
under
point
2
of
the
brief.
there's
a
whole
series
of
authorities.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it
--
it
begins
at
page
--
it
begins
at
--
it's
--
its
points
2
and
3
of
the
brief.
it
cites
a
whole
series
of
(inaudible)
this
brief
which
the
government
submitted
to
the
--
which
our
government
submitted
to
the
canadian
government,
i
didn't
know
about
it
at
that
time,
but
certainly,
its
as
strong
in
authority
as
i
could
get.
this
was
the
official
position
of
the
united
states
taken
only
a
few
years
before
they
decided
to
take
another
position.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
the
question
with
respect
to
foreign
troops
on
our
soil,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
insofar
as
i
know,
we
have
never
tried
any
foreign
troops
that
happened
to
be
stationed
on
our
soil.
besides
the
number
of
troops
that
are
on
our
soil
are
insignificant
as
one
of
the
--
how
--
of
one
of
the
members
of
the
house
said,
“when
we
have
large
bodies
of
troops
on
our
soil,
they
would
not
be
here
to
protect
us.
they
will
be
here
to
make
war
with
us.”
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
we
didn't
try
them.
i
think
--
i
think
we
permitted
them
to
be
returned
to
their
--
to
the
--
to
the
governments
from
which
they
came
for
appropriate
trial.
i
--
i
know
of
no
case
where
we
tried
a
--a
foreign
soldier
in
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
and
i'll
tell
you
how
that
came
about
in
just
a
few
moments.
and
for
your
information,
your
honor,
in
this
canadian
brief
when
they
told
the
canadian
high
court
that
there
was
absolute
immunity
from
jurisdiction
of
the
local
government
over
the
foreign
forces,
they
cite
as
their
first
authority
for
that
proposition,
the
schooner
exchange
case.
and
now
they're
cited
for
the
other
proposition.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
(voice
overlap)
--
the
matter
of
law
under
international
law.
that
consent
was
implied
by
the
fact
that
they
agreed
to
have
the
foreign
troops
upon
their
territory.
there's
no
question
about
the
general
principle
that
a
nation
is
sovereign
if
it's
its
own
--
own
territory.
and
the
only
waive
in
a
limited
sovereignty
is
by
consent.
but
under
international
law
when
it
permitted
foreign
troops
to
enter
upon
its
territory,
it
gave
consent.
that
is
the
rule
of
international
law
or
that
is
the
position
which
our
government
took
with
the
canadian
government.
that
is
the
position,
which
has
been
supported
time
and
time
again.
and
that
is
the
doctrine,
which
they
teach
the
west
point
military
academy.
and
--
and
to
give
you
one
of
the
short
quote
from
what
has
been
taught
up
there
that
appears
in
the
brief
as
shown
and
the
consent
is
given
when
you
authorize
the
foreign
--
the
foreign
troops
to
come
on
to
your
territory.
"all
the
members
of
the
united
states
army
is
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
its
court-martial.
yet,
while
the
army
is
within
the
territory
limits
of
the
united
states,
the
civil
or
federal
and
state,
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
the
members.
however,
the
jurisdiction
of
courts-martial
becomes
exclusive
when
the
army
leaves
its
own
territorial
limits
as
for
instance
when
the
army
marches
through
a
friendly
country
or
stationed
therein.
in
such
cases,
consent
of
the
friendly
government
from
a
--
or
exemption
from
its
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
is
assumed
as
a
matter,
of
course.
should
it
deny
this
consent
and
act
otherwise,
it
would
give
rise
to
serious
consequences."
we
told
that
to
the
canadian
government.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that
has
been
the
principle
until
the
beginning
of
this
program
to
surrender
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
there
was
--
there
were
dissents.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
there
were
some
dissents
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
there
were
some
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
your
honor,
i
only
know
what
i
read
in
the
congressional
record
and
i
can
read
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
--
but
--
but
when
--
but
when
the
congressional
record
quotes
from
the
opinions
of
the
judges
up
there,
i
assume
that
what
our
congressmen
put
into
the
record
and
what
the
record
contains
is
accurate.
and
that
is
what
we're
saying.
it
is
true
that
if
we
have
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
but
if
--
if
the
case,
the
name
of
the
case
is
referred
to,
the
brief
is
in
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
it
--
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
full
--
it
is
the
full
text
of
the
brief
which
was
submitted
to
the
canadian
government,
the
full
text
quoted
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
right
in
the
congressional
record.
we
know
very
often
they
put
complete
documents
in
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
some
congressman
i
assume.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
what
the
congressman
did
was
took
an
official
document
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
if
you
--
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
executive
agreement,
i
will
say
but
it
was
not
achieved.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
the
--
the
--
these
were
hearings
before
the
congress
to
--
to
--
and
for
--
on
--
on
the
subject
matter
of
a
resolution
to
call
upon
the
powers
that
be
--
to
modify
or
change
the
status
of
forces
agreements.
the
main
basis
to
be
that
having
been
that
in
view
of
the
experience
with
these
agreements.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
they're
not
treaties,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
the
nato
--
the
nato
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
nato
--
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreements
within
one
category.
this
is
not
a
nato
--
nato
status
of
forces
agreement.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
treaty
but
the
question
here
and
we
will
come
to
it,
whether
or
not
we
have
the
right
to
enter
into
such
a
treaty.
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
at
all
of
the
opinion
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
with
the
president
can
enter
into
a
treaty
with
any
nation,
which
would
deprive
any
of
our
citizens
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
and
one
senator
said
that
it
--
it
happened
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
when
the
general
nato
of
forces
treaties
were
submitted
along
with
this
one
on
the
jurisdiction
that
it
was
hurriedly
passed
on.
and
he
said,
“he
wishes
he
had
never
voted
for
it”,
and
on
that
subject,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
sorry
but
they
were
interruptions,
your
honor.
a
--
a
representative
bow
--
representative
bow.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir,
representative
bow
--
congressman
bow
of
ohio.
on
the
subject
of
how
this
treaty
came
how
this
--
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreements
came
into
effect,
it
was
being
debated.
it
was
a
very
serious
subject.
it
was
tied
in
with
the
other
agreements.
and
when
it
appeared
that
it
would
not
pass,
the
president
of
the
united
states
sent
a
personal
letter.
and
this
is
what
it
says.
and
i
would
say
that
relying
on
the
text
of
that
letter,
“even
if
i
were
a
senator,
i
would
vote
as
the
president
request.”
now,
this
is
his
language,
“i
certainly
appreciate
the
concern
of
those
who
fear
that
these
agreements
might
subject
american
soldiers
overseas
to
systems
of
civil
justice
foreign
to
our
own
traditions.
i
do
not
fear
--
i
do
not
share
such
fears,
however,
because
of
the
many
years
experience
i
have
had
in
command
of
american
troops
overseas.
that
experience
convinces
me
that
our
friends
abroad
will
continue
to
cooperate
as
they
have
in
the
past
in
turning
over
those
charged
with
offenses
against
their
laws
to
our
own
military
courts
for
trial.”
that
is
what
president
eisenhower
said
in
a
personal
letter
to
the
senate
in
order
to
get
the
necessary
two-thirds
vote
to
get
these
nato
treaties
through.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
think,
your
honor,
from
my
knowledge
of
what
has
happened
to
our
boys
overseas
in
the
foreign
jails
where
they're
still
permitted
to
use
the
guillotine
and
the
firing
squad
and
the
solitary
confinement
that
the
president
was
not
making
a
very
fine
prophecy.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
you
are
permitted
to
use
the
guillotine
in
certain
countries
in
europe.
i
think
france
is
one.
some
countries
still
permit
the
firing
squad
or
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
if
--
if
this
court
thinks
that's
constitutional
and
proper,
well
i
--
i
won't
go
any
further
in
that
circuit
but.
[laughs]
this
--
the
--
the
subject
matter
of
the
97%
of
the
waivers,
your
honor,
is
meaningless
unless
we
know
how
many
of
those
that
where
there
was
a
waiver
did
the
united
states
military
actually
try.
i
tried
to
get
those
figures.
they
wouldn't
supply
them.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
i
--
i'll
rephrase
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it's
important
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it's
--
it's
important
--
it's
important
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
most
of
these
cases
that
i
venture
i
guess
that
99%
of
them
were
automobile
accident
cases
on
the
streets
of
japan
where
japanese
authorities
picked
up
the
--
the
gi
or
maybe
--
maybe
--
who
probably
had
too
much
too
drink
or
didn't,
couldn't
read
the
japanese
sign
saying
go
right.
he
went
left
to
some
such
event.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
was
trying
to
get
those
figures,
your
honor.
i
can't
get
them.
it
appears
that
it
appears
in
the
congressional
record
that
most
of
these
cases
involved
automobile
accidents.
and
then
let's
assume
there's
a
--
there's
a
$3
slash
on
automobile
and
japanese
authorities
have
and
we
say
turn
them
back
to
us.
and
our
military
authorities
get
them.
they
count
that
as
a
waiver.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
the
--
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
automobile
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
--
i'm
not
trying
to
shave
it
down,
your
honor.
the
--
the
figure
of
97%
is
actually
meaningless
unless
we
know
whether
or
not
there
was
--
they
--
they
were
offenses
which
we
then
brought
them
to
--
for
which
we
brought
them
to
trial.
and
there's
another
fact
in
which
you
want
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
even
--
even
using
your
own
--
your
honor's
own
argument
as
a
basis
of
japan
sending
over
99
and
nine-tenths
percent,
if
under
our
law,
we
may
not
turn
over
one.
that's
the
issue
we're
concerned
with
here.
and
for
your
honor's
information,
i
think
for
the
past
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'll
get
to
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'll
--
i'll
get
to
that,
your
honor
and
show
what
--
what
treatment
they're
getting.
but
its
not
in
--
it's
not
in
the
course
of
my
argument
at
the
present
time.
i
--
i
cannot
cover
the
whole
ground
at
the
one
time.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
very
well.
but
we
must
remember
that
100
years
ago,
japan
wasn't
even
open
for
civilization.
now,
we
must
--
we
must
also
remember
that
the
japanese
courtesy
and
the
japanese
ideas
of
--
of
what
is
right
and
what's
wrong,
we
saw
an
example
of
it
on
december
7th,
1941.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
we're
not
talking
about
a
hundred
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
we're
not
talking
about
150
years
ago.
we're
talking
about
the
current
generation.
to
me,
it
is
weird
to
take
american
soldiers
who
have
sworn
to
sacrifice
their
life,
if
necessary,
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
turn
them
over
to
a
foreign
country
for
trial,
needlessly,
and
strip
them
their
very
constitutional
right.
now,
if
that's
the
rule,
which
this
court
reached
the
status
at
present,
there's
nothing
i
can
say.
i'm
here
to
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
sure
not,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
sure
not.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
when
this
court
expressed
--
if
the
last
word
from
this
court
on
what
our
constitutional
rights
appeared
in
reid
against
covert
only
decided
here
just
about
a
month
ago.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
on
the
vote
that
party
as
they
decide.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
it
--
it
certainly
had
the
effect
of
turning
these
two
ladies
loose.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
--
i
think
the
decision
was
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
sustained.
and
that
two
ladies
were
--
were
turned
loose
and
that
there
--
there
were
--
there
were
several
different
opinions
but
the
--
the
opinion
i
--
i
think
of
mr.
justice
black
concurred
in
by
the
chief
justice
and
two
or
three
additional
justices
to
my
mind,
stated
the
law
of
this
court.
now,
if
i'm
wrong,
i'm
wrong.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
very
well,
sir.
that
--
that
--
but
i
--
i
think
to
get
on
with
the
subject
matter
of
whether
or
not
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
just
as
this
court
recessed,
the
half
hour
was
about
to
stay
in
connection
with
the
so-called
97%
of
the
waivers,
but
the
fact
is
that
even
with
all
those
waivers,
we
have
more
american
soldiers
in
jail
in
any
other
foreign
country
in
the
world.
imagine
what
we
would
have
there
if
there
were
no
waivers.
and
in
the
back
of
the
appendix,
the
last
appendix
we
have
attached
to
our
brief,
your
honors
will
note
a
directive
that
was
issued
from
one
of
the
commands,
by
one
of
the
commands
in
the
japanese
area,
and
the
substance
of
it
is
to
the
effect
that
all
men
must
be
more
than
careful
in
driving
their
automobiles
through
the
streets
of
japan
because
on
to
say
that
you
can
be
held
criminally
liable
in
japan
on
the
base
of
criminal
negligence,
even
though
it
wouldn't
give
rise
to
civil
liability
in
the
united
states.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
if
you
do
not
want
to
join
the
other
men
in
the
armed
forces
in
the
japanese
jails,
we
advice
that
you
express
sympathy
to
the
family.
and
then,
they
quote
from
a
decision
of
one
of
the
japanese
judges,
where
he
imprisoned
one
of
our
men
and
he
said
the
reason
for
the
imprisonment
was
because
he
failed
to
express
sympathy
to
the
family
after
an
unfortunate
event.
and
so,
waiver
or
no
waiver,
the
fact
remains
that
we
have
more
difficulty
with
the
japanese
nation
insofar
as
putting
our
men
into
their
jails
than
any
other
country
in
the
world.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
similar
contracts
or
agreements
or
executive
arrangements,
whatever
we
may
wish
to
call
them
were
some
50
odd
nations
and
whether
this
court
knows
it
or
not.
a
good
many
of
them
are
secret.
nobody
could
see
them,
no
soldier
overseas,
no
what
--
with
the
states
in
that
particular
country
knows
what
his
rights
or
liabilities
are
insofar
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned.
they
are
secret
even
the
senate
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
difficulty
trying
to
obtain
them.
as
one
congress
lady
put
it,
i
really
challenged
the
right
of
the
state
department
or
the
defense
department
to
make
dealings
with
americans
which
--
to
make
--
to
make
arrangements
dealing
with
americans,
which
have
anything
in
them
or
any
policy
back
of
it
or
any
desire
to
conciliate
or
go
around
which
would
serve
to
prevent
those
from
knowing
the
exact
terms,
prevent
the
american
people
from
knowing
the
exact
terms.
i
cannot
understand
or
accept
the
necessity
of
secrecy.
and
when
the
government
officials
of
these
hearings
will
question
this
that
--
that
these
documents,
they
used
the
time-worn
phrase.
they
are
classified
and
we
can
supply
no
information.
now,
imagine,
a
soldier
in
the
united
states
army
assigned
to
some
far
off
land
and
being
told
that
he
may
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
--
of
the
land
which
he
--
which
he
stationed
without
he
or
his
lawyer
or
anybody
else
being
able
to
know
what
secret
arrangement
the
state
and
war
departments
made
with
the
government
wherein
he
is
stationed.
in
the
case
of
the
japanese
agreement,
it
is
not
secret
as
such.
but
how
did
the
japanese
arrangement
come
about?
when
the
nato
status
of
forces
contract
was
submitted
to
the
senate,
and
by
the
way
it
was
submitted
to
the
senate
almost
three
years
after
the
agreements
were
made
and
many
senators
questioned
why
it
was
being
submitted
at
that
time,
the
senate,
when
it
ratified,
specifically
stated
that
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
shall
not
be
a
precedence
for
similar
agreements
in
any
other
country.
that's
not
the
exact
language
but
that's
the
text
of
it.
and
they
also
reserved,
they
also
made
a
reservation
that
in
any
case
where
a
united
states
soldier
may
be
--
may
be
deprived
or
denied
of
any
constitutional
right
that
he
should
not
be
turned
over
to
a
foreign
government
for
trial.
those
were
the
two
mandates
which
the
senate
expressed
at
the
time
it
ratified
or
consented
to
the
--
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement.
at
least
insofar
as
the
nato
countries
are
concerned,
the
--
they
are
the
european
countries
whose
system
of
justice
is
more
nearly
akin
to
ours
than
some
of
the
asiatic
countries.
but
the
congress,
nevertheless,
imposed
those
two
restrictions
on
any
further
action
insofar
as
making
these
agreements
with
other
countries
who
are
concerned
but
that
did
not
stop
the
men
who
were
making
them.
they
continued
to
make
them,
some
secret,
others
exposed
with
all
countries
in
the
world
and
when
they
were
asked
why,
they
were
asked
by
the
congressional
committees,
"why
did
you
do
this?
why
did
you
surrender
this
jurisdiction?"
they
said,
"it
was
the
best
we
could
get."
and
then,
they
were
asked,
“were
there
any
country
say
that
they
would
not
permit
us
to
station
our
troops
in
that
country
in
the
event
we
did
not
surrender
the
jurisdiction?”
there
was
no
answer.
it
was
--
it
was
asked
at
least
10
or
15
times
by
a
various
congressmen
and
senators,
as
to
whether
or
not
any
country
laid
down
as
a
condition
to
the
united
states
having
bases
or
troops
within
their
area,
whether
we
must
surrender
jurisdiction
over
our
own
men
and
no
country
was
pointed
to
as
having
made
that
demand
on
the
united
states.
and
so,
these
agreements
were
made.
first,
they
were
wholly
unnecessary.
secondly,
they
violated
our
--
the
international
law.
and
thirdly,
they
are
unconstitutional.
and
before
getting
into
the
unconstitutional
question,
i
want
to
state
that
these
very
officials
who
point
to
the
justice
of
foreign
countries
as
being
excellent
in
something
which
our
men
must
endure
when
they're
serving
in
the
armed
forces
that
these
very
officials
reserved
immunity
to
themselves,
the
soldiers,
they
said,
may
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
country,
but
we
the
officials
or
anybody
connected
with
the
nato
organization,
and
this
is
not
the
group
that's
in
the
diplomatic
status,
they
said,
we
for
ourselves
will
not
submit
to
the
foreign
jurisdictions.
and
i
think
it
would
be
enlightening
to
the
court
to
know
the
theory
on
which
one
group
of
our
--
of
our
citizens
were
subjected
to
foreign
jurisdiction
and
on
what
theory
the
other
was
not
subjected.
and
these
are
questions
asked
of
mr.
rankin
by
--
by
congressman
(inaudible)
page
352
of
the
congressional
hearing
record
to
which
i
have
referred
before.
mr.
(inaudible)
from
the
standpoint
of
attorney
general's
office,
couldn't
the
same
range
be
made
with
respect
to
the
military.
i'm
referring
to
the
arrangements
made
for
the
nato
employees.
mr.
rankin
"well,
it
is
a
different
right
when
you
don't
have
the
right
of
the
individual
because
he
is
not
forwarding
the
interest
of
the
government."
mr.
(inaudible)
--
i'm
skipping
several
questions
and
answers
because
they
deal
generally
with
the
subject.
mr.
(inaudible)
“but
wouldn't
you
consider
the
presence
of
our
forces
there
as
furthering
also
the
national
interest
and
wellbeing
the
same
as
our
diplomatic
people?”
and
someone
else
answered
and
said,
"yes,
i
do,"
but
so
and
so
said
something
else.
then,
there
were
further
questions
asked
to
mr.
rankin
as
to
how
these
agreements
came
about
and
i'll
read
two
or
three
questions
and
answers.
mr.
bentley
“if
i
may
resume
the
question
with
you
again,
mr.
rankin,
i
am
still
trying
to
see
if
we
can't
get
a
definite
answer
to
this
question.
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
constitution
does
not
follow
members
of
the
armed
forces
overseas.”
mr.
rankin
“that's
right.”
mr.
bentley
“my
contention
is,
sir,
that
the
military
justice
code
and
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
likewise
does
not
follow
them
overseas
under
the
status
of
forces
agreement.”
mr.
rankin
“it
does
as
much
as
it
does
within
this
country.”
mr.
bentley
“let's
not
make
a
comparison,
sir.
let's
leave
it
to
the
--
let's
leave
it
overseas.
what
would
be
--
what
--
would
that
be
correct?”
mr.
rankin
“i
can't
answer
that
yes
or
no.
as
long
as
they
are
on
duty,
the
code
follows
them
throughout
the
world.”
mr.
bentley
“if
they
are
uniformed
and
not
on
duty,
it
does
not
follow
them,
would
that
be
correct?”
“that
would
be
correct.”
and
so,
we
have
testimony
given
to
the
effect
--
a
man
in
uniform
who
was
not
on
duty
is
not
subject
to
our
military
code
and
we
have
the
statement
made
in
this
record
that
if
he
is
on
duty,
he
is
subject
to
the
military
code.
now,
this
case,
the
facts
--
in
this
case,
the
facts
are
stipulated.
it
was
stipulated
that
girard
was
on
duty.
it
was
stipulated
in
the
court
below
that
he
was
in
the
performance
of
duty.
the
code
provides
that
if
there
was
any
issue
of
fact
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
petitioner
must
be
produced
to
give
any
necessary
evidence
in
order
to
avoid
girard
from
being
--
being
brought
to
the
united
states
to
give
evidence.
they
stipulated
that
whatever
was
done,
the
acts,
which
he
committed
which
gave
rise
to
the
offense
was
committed
in
the
course
of
official
duty.
now,
testimony
has
been
given
before
the
senate,
before
the
congress
that
if
a
man
is
in
the
course
of
the
performance
of
official
duty
that
even
under
these
agreements,
assuming
for
the
moment
they
are
valid,
he
may
not
be
tried
by
any
other
government.
now,
to
turn
to
how
the
japanese
agreements
came
into
effect.
there
was
this
security.
first,
there
was
the
peace
treaty,
then
there
was
the
security
pact.
the
security
pact
recites
in
this
preempt
that
in
order
to
protect
japan,
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states,
but
in
order
to
--
to
protect
japan,
the
united
states
would
be
permitted
to
retain
certain
bases
and
stations,
certain
of
its
armed
forces
there
that
in
connection
with
the
--
i
think
agreements
for
the
disposition
of
forces,
i
have
to
get
the
exact
language,
an
administrative
agreement
would
be
--
would
be
entered
into.
an
administrative
agreement
was
entered
into.
it
dealt
with
the
civic
matter
of
the
disposition
of
forces,
facilities,
rights
and
so
forth,
and
in
addition,
had
contained
there
in
the
clause
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
our
armed
forces
shall
continue
to
remain
within
the
united
states.
and
there
was
the
added
clause
that
in
the
event,
the
nato
--
the
nato
status
of
forces
treaty
should
go
into
effect
that
the
option
of
japan,
the
united
states
may
enter
into
a
similar
agreement
with
japan
or
would
enter
into
a
similar
agreement
with
japan.
the
negotiations
leading
up
to
this
similar
agreement,
we
do
not
know,
but
we
do
know
that
a
so-called
protocol
was
then
entered
into,
which
completely
reversed
the
situation
as
it
had
been
under
the
administrative
agreement.
the
senators
of
the
united
states
never
was
called
upon
and
never
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
this
protocol.
it
was
not
in
existence
when
they
ratified
the
nato
status
for
forces
agreement
with
the
two
reservations.
and
after
the
protocol
was
drawn,
it
still
was
not
sufficient
to
want
the
transfer
of
jurisdiction
from
one
nation
to
another.
and
so,
another
instrument
was
entered
into,
called
agreed
views.
these
were
the
officials
in
--
in
japan,
japanese
officials
and
the
american
officials
sitting
down
and
agreeing
to
certain
views
as
to
how
or
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
the
protocol
was
and
that
wasn't
sufficient.
they
then
had
some
minutes
of
the
meetings,
which
they
attached
to
the
protocol
and
said,
that
is
a
part
of
the
protocol.
followed
by
that
--
thereafter,
there
was
the
--
a
circular
which
was
issued
and
all
these
documents
put
together,
the
government
now
contends
and
gave
the
executive
department
of
this
government
the
power
to
strip
a
man
who
was
in
a
duty
status
of
the
protection
of
the
united
states
code
--
of
the
united
states
military
code
and
turn
him
over
to
the
japanese
government
for
trial.
and
it
was
admitted
in
a
--
a
special
hearing
that
was
held
on
the
girard
case
on
june
15th,
i
think
it
was
of
this
year
before
a
subcommittee
of
the
senate,
that
the
power
to
make
the
determination
as
to
who
would
exercise
jurisdiction
was
in
japan
and
not
in
us,
that
the
papers
were
so
drawn
that
while
the
united
states
did
protest
that
jurisdiction,
this
was
jurisdiction
that
was
--
went
out
assuming
now
that
the
--
the
agreements
were
valid,
that
nevertheless
the
ultimate
decision
as
to
where
the
jurisdiction
would
lie
was
in
the
japanese
government.
and
finally,
in
this
particular
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
the
united
states
has
taken
the
position
that
because
of
the
documents
which
followed
the
agreed
views
and
the
--
you
see
the
protocol
was
the
third
step.
the
first
step,
the
--
then
--
then
came
the
agreed
views,
which
was
the
agreement
between
the
--
the
government
--
the
government
representatives
agreed
to
in
a
roundtable
of
conference
and
then
the
menace
of
that
agreement
and
they
claimed
pursuant
to
those
minutes
attached
to
the
agreed
views
and
then
the
circular,
which
was
issued
thereafter
that
the
power
was
vested
in
the
japanese
government
alone
to
make
the
determinations
to
whether
or
not
it
was
an
on
duty
or
off
duty
case.
and
in
the
brief,
there's
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
turkish
government
has
taken
the
same
position
in
--
in
another
case
under
a
similar
arrangement
but
it
did
not
flow
from
the
protocol
as
such.
the
claim
is
that
it
flowed
from
the
agreed
views
document,
which
they
say
is
law.
on
what
theory,
i
don't
know,
but
they
say
that
is
the
law
and
therefore,
abiding
on
us.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
the
right
--
there
--
there
as
--
if
i
recall
correctly,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
protocol
which
gives
the
right
to
--
to
waive.
i
think
it
comes
in
the
agreed
views.
i
--
i'm
not
sure.
there
were
so
many
documents
here.
what
does
the
protocol
say
on
this?
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carl
tells
me
that
it
does
flow
from
the
protocol
but
then
they
changed
the
definition
under
agreed
views.
they
changed
the
definition
of
what
official
duty
meant.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
know.
there
--
there
are
so
--
there
are
so
many
--
there
are
so
many
documents
here
that
i
--
i
couldn't
answer
all.
i
just
--
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
but
i
do
not
agree
that
the
protocol
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
right.
that's
right,
sir.
now,
let
--
let
us
turn
to
the
constitutional
issue
involved.
the
constitution
says
that
the
power
to
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
we
challenged
it
on
the
interpretation.
that's
in
--
that's
part
of
the
brief
but
the
time
is
running
out,
your
honor.
i
--
i
won't
be
able
to
cover
all
the
ground.
we
challenged
it
on
the
constitutional
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
covered
also.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
what
i'm
--
that's
what
i'm
going
to.
the
--
the
treaty
doesn't
authorize
it
because
the
nato
treaty
that
the
senate
consented
to
had
the
reservations
that
it
shall
not
be
a
question
for
any
further
treaties
of
--
of
similar
nature.
and
even
if
as
mr.
rankin
says,
“the
agreement
for
jurisdiction,
the
administrative
agreement,
was
within
the
knowledge
of
the
senators
who
voted
to
ratify
the
nato
agreement
that
--
that
particular
agreement
held
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states.
and
then
when
the
protocol
was
entered
into,
which
was
never
brought
to
--
to
the
senate
and
it
was
entered
into
by
the
ambassador,
the
american
ambassador
in
japan,
he
simply
reversed
the
situation
as
it
was
and
conferred
almost
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
the
japanese
government
with
the
exception
of
this
on
duty
cases
and
one
of
two
case
involving
security
and
property
and
persons
of
the
united
states.
but
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
pardon,
sir?
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
the
--
the
waiver
raised
an
entirely
different
issue
whether
or
not
the
part
respecting
in
waiver
is
legal
or
constitutional.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
--
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
recall,
your
honor,
whether
there's
anything
in
there
about
waiver
or
not
if
your
honor
has
read
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
--
i
don't
recall.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
--
your
honor,
i've
read
so
many
documents
for
the
last
two
weeks.
i
just
can't
remember
the
exact
words
of
any
specific
document.
i'm
trying
to
generalize
as
best
i
can
for
memory
what
the
particular
document
says
and
i'm
sure
that
it
says
that
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
and
if
your
honor
says,
it's
provisions
for
waiver
in
their
way,
i
--
i
don't
recall
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
--
i
don't
recall.
what
--
what
did
that
thing
say?
anyhow
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
sir,
and
all
the
documents
that
follow,
we
challenged
on
this
basis
and
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
fundamental
law.
the
constitution
says
that
the
right
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
government
of
our
armed
forces
is
in
the
congress.
that
means
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
combined,
a
congress
has
enacted
a
code,
which
is
to
govern
our
armed
forces
insofar
as
discipline
is
concerned.
and
they
put
a
clause
in
there
to
the
effect
that
this
code
--
i
don't
recall
the
words
--
the
words
in
substance
out
of
this
code
shall
govern
in
all
parts
of
the
world.
it
was
obviously
in
the
intent
of
the
congress
who
were
vested
with
constitutional
power
to
declare
crimes
in
the
modes
of
--
of
the
procedure
for
its
punishment
and
the
modes
of
appeal
and
the
types
of
evidence,
all
of
which
is
set
forth
in
the
united
states
code
in
the
--
the
--
that
is
the
united
states
military
code,
in
the
manual
for
courts-martial
which
is
an
adjunct
to
the
code
states
what
the
jurisdiction
is.
it
says
it's
in
--
it's
in
the
court-martial.
we
take
the
position
that
when
the
constitution
vested
that
power
in
congress,
that
is
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
--
the
senate
combined,
that
both
the
executive
--
that
the
executive
alone
and
the
executive
combined
with
the
senate
could
not
take
any
action
which
would
take
away
the
prerogatives
of
the
--
of
the
congress
which
the
constitution
vested
in
them.
when
it
says
that
this
code
shall
govern
our
armed
forces
all
over
the
world,
it
meant
exactly
that.
it
prescribed
the
character
of
the
crimes
which
will
be
punished.
it
--
it
prescribed
the
procedure
that
would
be
gone
through.
it
refers
to
--
as
this
court
well
knows,
it's
very
detailed
on
the
whole
subject.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
historically,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
came
about
in
this
way
if
i
recall
correctly.
originally,
under
the
old
articles
of
war,
this
particular
section
had
reference
to
delivery
to
the
civil
law
authorities
within
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states
only.
and
then
a
case
arose
where
an
individual
left
germany
and
returned
to
united
states.
at
that
time,
germany
was
under,
more
or
less
a
civilian
administration
as
against
the
former
military
occupation,
we
have
the
allied
high
commission
functioning
there,
and
the
subject
matter
of
being
able
to
--
to
take
this
individual
back
to
germany
and
deliver
him
to
the
civil
law
--
to
our
civil
law
authorities
in
germany
for
trial
there
came
up
and
the
limitation
that
was
contained
in
the
old
articles
of
war,
limiting
the
right
to
deliver
to
areas
within
continental
limits
of
the
united
states
only
was
taken
out.
the
historical
background
of
that
enactment
will
indicate
to
your
honors
that
it
--
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
senate
to
give
unlimited
political
power
or
discretion
in
the
president
or
the
executive
to
transfer
any
person
or
to
take
away
the
protection
of
the
military
code
from
anyone
of
our
men
in
the
armed
forces.
and
i
say
this
that
if
in
fact
it
is
interpreted
that
that
particular
section
--
i
think
it's
article
xiv,
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
at
that
particular
section
authorize
or
permits
the
executive
to
strip
a
soldier
of
his
--
of
his
protective
rights
under
the
military
code
that
that
section
is
unconstitutional
because
the
--
the
--
there
is
no
procedure
established
for
so
doing,
one.
secondly,
no
branch
in
the
government
or
even
the
three
branches
of
the
government
combined
have
it
within
their
power
to
take
the
constitutional
rights
away
from
any
individual.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
your
honor,
that
came
up
in
the
mobley-handy
case.
that's
the
case
i
have
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it
was
not
passed
upon
by
this
court.
i
don't
not
think.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
--
i
don't
recall
that
one.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
if
--
if
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
we
have
extradition
treaties,
of
course,
to
cover
the
senate
matter
of
transporting
citizens
from
one
nation
to
another.
the
valentine
case
in
which
your
honors
are
unquestionably
familiar,
laid
down
the
landmark
rule
that
the
executive
did
not
have
the
power
to
transfer
an
individual
out
of
this
country
and
i
think
in
that
case,
french
citizens
were
involved.
to
the
french
government
upon
the
demand
of
a
latter
government
accept
that
an
extradition
treaty
so
specifically
provided.
in
that
case,
the
opinion
was
written
by
chief
justice
hughes,
my
recollection
is
that
the
--
the
holding
is
to
the
effect
that
even
if
there
were
discretionary
power
vested
in
the
president
that
unless
there
was
a
mandate
or
a
decree
of
the
congress
whereby
he
was
authorized
to
act
that
the
individual
could
not
be
turned
over.
in
the
valentine
case,
the
individual
bought
--
brought
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
the
power
of
the
president
to
transfer
him,
even
under
an
extradition
treaty
was
tested,
and
the
individual
was
sustained,
the
power
was
not
there.
in
another
case
which
is
referred
to
in
the
brief,
an
alien,
a
mexican
that
came
into
this
country
--
i
don't
recall
the
exact
phrase,
but
he
was
here
in
the
present
figure
that
--
decided
that
he
was
detrimental
to
the
best
interest
of
the
united
states,
i
think
he
was
in
texas,
and
an
order
was
issued
in
the
name
of
the
president
to
the
commanding
officer
that
that
man
be
held
in
confinement.
the
argument
was
and
he
was
acting
as
commander
in
chief,
the
same
--
advance
in
this
case,
he
was
arguing
--
he
was
acting
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
armed
forces
and
he
can
hold
anyone
in
confinement
or
act
as
he
surfeit
with
the
individual,
particularly
an
enemy
in
this
country
or
not
an
enemy,
a
--
an
alien.
in
that
case,
the
district
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
stated
that
it
was,
well,
it
had
been
on
the
bench
a
long
time
and
he
felt
that
he
was
being
called
upon
to
perform
one
of
the
most
difficult
duties
he
had
during
the
period
he
was
on
the
bench.
he
nevertheless,
directed
that
the
individual
would
be
free
holding
that
even
a
--
an
arrest
that
the
direction
of
the
president
would
not
be
binding
on
the
individual.
that
is
for
the
courts
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
any
law
by
which
an
individual
may
be
held
in
confinement.
i
--
i
see
i'm
running
--
i'm
running
out
of
my
time.
i
want
to
touch,
if
your
honors
please,
upon
the
subject
matter
of
what
constitutional
rights
are
taken
away.
first
of
all,
there's
not
only
the
question
of
--
of
due
process.
there
is
the
question
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
let's
assume
that
in
this
particular
case,
instead
of
an
individual,
a
small
g.i.
like
girard
was
involved.
it
was
an
officer
of
high
rank
or
even
our
own
commanding
general
in
the
far
east
command
that
he
was
in
the
camp
weir
area
and
in
the
course
of
attempting
to
scare
someone
from
the
military
post,
a
--
a
trespasser
who
was
there,
and
by
the
way,
this
was
a
trespass
because
there
was
signs
there
that
no
--
no
foreigners
were
permitted
to
come
on
the
area,
no
--
note
after
his
nozzle
--
the
bullet
come
out
again.
he
accidentally
killed
someone.
to
me,
it
would
be
the
most
humiliating
sight
to
imagine
that
one
of
--
to
imagine
one
of
our
high
ranking
officers
be
in
trial
before
the
civilian
courts
of
a
former
enemy
nation
and
there
is
nothing
in
these
agreements
that
they're
valid
that
would
prevent
the
japanese
government
from
making
demand
that
they'd
be
permitted
to
try,
our
general
or
some
high
official
in
--
in
the
military
who
happened
to
be
stationed
in
the
area,
unless
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
that
case
would
agree
not
to
waive.
and
then,
we
have
a
situation
where
a
political
decision
may
deny
to
a
person
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
in
the
one
case
because
of
the
rank,
the
individual
would
not
be
turned
over.
in
the
other
case
because
he
is
a
lowly
g.i.,
he
is
turned
over.
and
yet,
if
--
what
the
appellant
--
what
the
appellants
in
this
case
contend
and
their
exact
--
their
exact
contentions
so
there'd
be
no
--
no
question
about
any
--
any
misquotation,
they
say,
“the
decision
of
the
united
states
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
this
case
is
a
discretionary
decision
of
the
executive
branch
and
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
military
defense
of
the
united
states
and
as
such
is
a
political
decision
not
subject
to
judicial
review.”
we
don't
think
that
any
individual,
any
american
citizen
can
be
taken
outside
the
pail
of
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
by
a
political
decision.
they
say
it
was
done
hereby
a
political
decision.
that's
not
our
words.
those
are
the
words
of
the
--
of
the
appellants.
and
when
you
get
to
a
point
where
individuals'
rights
are
determined
by
political
decisions
of
the
executive
branch
of
government,
i
think,
we
are
embarking
upon
a
dangerous
road
to
the
destruction
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
all
persons.
the
--
the
constitution
as
has
been
said
not
only
by
this
court
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
doesn't
--
as
of
the
opinion
is
not
the
opinion
of
the
whole
court,
which
is
true,
but
by
the
highest
military
court
in
the
united
states,
they
had
this
subject
before
them,
the
case
i
referred
to
in
the
brief,
where
they
said
constitutional
safeguards
follow
our
soldiers
wherever
they
are
in
any
land
and
they
pointed
out
how
impossible
it
was
for
a
man
in
our
military
service
to
be
afforded
the
same
protection
in
the
courts
of
a
foreign
country
as
he
--
as
he
is
in
this
country.
the
government
points
to
seven
rights
which
they
say
an
individual
has
when
he's
on
trial
on
foreign
countries
being
the
equivalent
of
constitutional
rights,
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
i
think
mr.
justice
nolan
--
senator
nolan
commented
on
that.
he
said,
“even
--
even
a
communist
can
be
entitled
to
that”
and
he
said
the
right
to
be
--
to
--
to
have
a
copy
of
the
charges.
well,
it
is
a
fact
that
in
one
case
it's
come
up.
the
charges
were
--
in
japan,
the
charges
that
were
served
upon
the
man
the
very
day
he
appeared
in
court.
they
then
referred
to
the
--
i'll
--
i'll
give
you
the
seven
rights
which
we'll
say
the
equivalent
of
all
our
constitutional
safeguards.
they
say
three
witnesses
must
confront
the
accused.
well,
actually
in
practice,
we
know
so
in
france,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
so
in
--
in
japan,
but
witnesses
do
not
in
every
case,
every
criminal
case
confront
the
accused.
a
dossier
is
made
up
by
the
magistrate
in
--
in
the
court
below
and
it's
handed
up
to
the
higher
judge
and
the
accused
is
brought
in.
the
--
in
any
event,
even
if
he
is
confronted
by
the
witnesses,
what
good
would
it
do?
he
doesn't
know
what
this
man
is
saying.
there
were
no
rules
of
evidence
as
we
understand
that
prescribed
what
he
may
say
then
they
referred
to
--
a
right
a
compulsory
process
but
they
add,
“if
the
witness
is
within
the
jurisdiction.”
but
what
if
a
man
is
charged
with
murder
and
the
witness
happens
to
be
one
--
one
mile
all
over
the
borderline?
there's
no
way
of
getting
him.
and
under
certain
part
--
under
the
laws
of
certain
countries
and
again
i
don't
know
whether
it's
true
in
japan
or
not,
you
may
produce
a
witness
but
then
you
can't
make
him
testify.
here,
we
have
our
normal
court
procedure
which
requires
a
witness
to
testify
when
you
bring
him
and
you
may
compel
him
to
testify.
that
is
not
so
in
all
the
countries
of
the
world.
then,
they
say
there
is
the
right
of
legal
representation
of
one's
own
choice.
if
an
example
of
what
happened
in
this
case,
any
criteria
of
the
right
to
which
--
in
which
they
were
referred
to
here,
a
japanese
counsel
was
appointed
for
girard
and
when
he
discharged
him,
he
publicly
announced
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
discharged
and
if
he
was,
the
court
will
reappoint
him
anyhow.
that
is
another
right,
the
appellants
point
to
as
being
guaranteed
this
individual
insofar
as
foreign
courts
are
concerned
and
then
he
has
the
right
to
have
an
interpreter
if
he
wants
it
and
a
right
to
communicate
with
his
own
government.
those
are
the
seven
basic
rights
to
which
the
appellants
referred
as
the
--
as
being
the
--
the
same
as
constitutional
safeguards.
and
if
your
honors
uphold
the
power
of
the
present
act
in
this
case,
what
is
there
to
stop
him
from
stripping
away
these
rights
and
saying,
"no,
we
won't
give
him
that.
we'll
give
him
one
right
when
he's
in
solitary
confinement.
we'll
let
someone
visit
him
once
a
year."
if
the
power
is
there,
he
may
go
that
far.
the
question
here
is
one
of
power,
what
are
the
limitations
upon
that
power?
the
government
officials
when
questioned
on
this
subject
matter
of
these
so-called
rights
that
were
the
substitute
--
substitute
for
our
bill
of
rights,
they
--
they
asked
this
witness
if
he
was
an
assistant
secretary
of
defense.
they
asked
him
the
specific
--
i'll
be
in
just
a
moment.
yes,
senator
ferguson
asked
mr.
nash
who
is
an
assistant
secretary
of
defense
and
who
said
that
--
in
his
own
testimony,
he
was
one
of
the
top
lawyers
in
connection
with
these
agreements.
senator
ferguson
“do
you
consider
the
presumption
of
innocence
does
not
enter
into
due
process?”
answer
“i
think
that
if
a
man
has
a
chance
to
prove
his
own
case,
to
develop
his
own
case
and
prove
his
own
facts
that
that
would
be
all,
it
would
be
absolute
required
in
elemental
justice
and
equity.
yes,
sir.”
now,
there
we
have
the
views
of
an
assistant
secretary
of
defense
given
before
the
senate
as
to
what
the
rights
of
an
individual
are
before
a
foreign
court.
we
take
the
position
that
there
has
been
a
usurpation
of
power
in
connection
with
the
execution
of
these
agreements
that
the
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
armed
forces
of
this
nation
vest
--
is
vested
solely
in
the
congress.
and
that
the
president
may
not
take
that
--
that
right
away.
the
president
and
the
senate
combined
may
not
take
that
right
away,
but
those
are
rights
--
that
there
were
rights,
which
are
guaranteed
under
the
constitution
and
while
it
has
been
said
many
times,
the
constitution
does
not
extend
beyond
the
territory
limits
of
the
united
states.
it
would
appear
that
the
more
recent
opinions
of
this
court
as
to
the
effect
that
it
does
follow
the
individual
under
certain
particular
circumstances.
there
are
cases
when
it
would
not,
a
tourist
going
to
france,
of
course,
or
in
any
other
--
to
any
other
country
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
he
is
there
with
his
own
volition.
one
of
the
government
witnesses
said
that
he
could
see
no
difference
between
a
tourist
going
to
france
and
a
soldier
who
is
drafted
into
the
armed
forces
being
ordered
to
go
to
france
that
they
are
both
equally
subject
to
the
local
jurisdiction.
and
then,
one
question
further
on
it,
they
were
asked,
“well,
how
about
--
how
about
an
offense
when
a
man
is
on
duty?”
and
this
exact
case
--
the
exact
situation
was
used
as
an
example
by
one
of
the
witnesses.
they
said
that
if
a
man
was
on
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
extracts
of
the
testimony
from
--
by
government
witnesses.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
--
i
was
looking
for
it
but
i
didn't
have
the
page.
i
think
the
--
the
statement
was
made
--
oh,
at
page
5a
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
senator
ferguson
asked
the
question
to
mr.
fargo.
i
am
interested
in
the
point
that
mr.
fargo
made
with
respect
to
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
military
reservations.
there's
another
subject
now.
there's
an
area
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
fargo
“that
is
not
right.
if
he
is
on
army
post
engaged
on
duty,
we
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.”
that's
what
the
senate
was
told
and
they
were
told
many
other
things
to
which
reference
have
been
made
before
and
reference
has
made
in
the
brief
but
i
--
i
would
not
--
i
will
not
have
time
to
further
go
into
the
subject.
i
want
to
spend
a
few
minutes
if
your
honors
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it
does
--
it
does
not
necessarily
fall.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
if
--
if
the
premise
that
we
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
not
accepted,
then
we
can
fondle
with
the
question
as
to
who
has
the
power
to
strip
an
american
citizen
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
the
articles
of
war,
the
so-called
military
code.
the
--
the
individual,
the
citizen
didn't
go
there
voluntarily.
the
citizen
is
subject
and
i
refer
to
the
specific
--
this
particular
case.
now,
he
is
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
nobody
except
possibly
the
congress
with
the
approval
of
the
president
could
take
away
his
right
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
japan,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
subject
matter,
which
is
reserved
to
mr.
carroll,
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
camp
weir
area
and
japan
even
under
these
agreements
assuming
they
are
violently
executed
and
constitutional
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
offense.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
assuming
the
agreements
are
valid,
your
honor.
japan
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
--
under
the
agreements
nor
did
japan
have
jurisdiction
over
the
camp
weir
area.
i'm
going
far
off
field
because
that's
a
subject
that
mr.
carroll
is
going
to
take
up
both
the
personal
immunity
and
the
territorial
immunity.
i
want
to
raise
just
one
more
civic
and
that's
--
that
is
in
connection
with
our
cross-appeal.
the
action
--
the
proceedings
were
brought
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
district
court
granted
a
substantial
part
--
granted
relief
but
not
the
specific
relief
asked
for.
the
relief
asked
for
was
that
this
man
to
be
discharged
from
custody.
it
may
be
said
that
we
obtained
all
that
we
would
want
under
the
circumstances
but
that
is
not
correct.
the
fact
is
this
man
is
still
held
in
custody
even
though
there
has
been
an
injunction
issued
against
the
government
officials
from
transferring
him
to
the
foreign
government.
he
is
not
on
the
court-martial
charges.
there
is
no
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be
free
to
go
as
any
other
soldier
is
free
to
go
and
move
about.
now,
the
argument
of
the
respondents
in
answer
is
two-fold.
first,
they
say
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
issued
therein,
the
same
old
errands
against
the
clock
coming
up
from
the
eisenhower
forest,
all
of
this
court
is
very
familiar
with.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it
would
not
be
good.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be
good.
that
--
well,
the
--
the
writ
requires
them
to
deliver
him
before
the
court.
that's
here
in
washington.
we
applied
for
the
writ
to
bring
him
before
the
court.
now,
the
code
says
that
if
there's
any
issue
of
fact
even
on
the
hearing,
they
must
produce
them
before
the
court.
what
they
are
saying
in
substance,
your
honor,
i
might
follow
the
logic
and
the
--
and
the
legal
reasoning
of
what
you've
said,
what
they
are
saying
is
what
hitler
said
when
he
put
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
in
jail
saying
they
were
there
in
protective
custody.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
what
they're
doing
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
in
saying
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
actually,
it
was
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
that's
correct,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
oh,
sure
but
that's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
he
--
he
wouldn't
do
that
but
he
is
not
only
restricted
to
the
camp
area,
your
honor.
it's
one
thing
to
stay
within
a
camp
area
voluntarily
and
it's
one
thing
to
have
a
police
officer
breathing
down
your
back
everywhere
you
move.
according
to
the
press,
he
had
police
officers
with
him
when
they
got
married
the
other
day.
that's
what
we're
complaining
about
and
we
say
the
position
of
the
government,
they
have
a
right
to
hold
a
man
in
protective
custody.
it's
not
for
them
to
say
whether
a
man
wants
to
be
protected.
we
don't
assume
that
girard
will
leave
this
area,
this
sanctuary
that
he
has
this
--
this
area
within
camp
weir
and
move
outside
where
the
japanese
can
seize
him.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
this
court
--
the
code
--
the
code
would
follow
him
but
there's
nothing
that's
said
that
the
court-martial
must
try
him.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
he's
subject
to
the
court-martial,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
if
the
government
is
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
if
he
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
your
honor.
he
--
he
is
still
--
he
is
still
subject
to
military
control.
what
we
are
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i'm
dealing
with
the
military
code
only.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
know
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
oh,
no
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
agree
with
you
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
your
honor
misunderstood
me
i
think
or
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
no,
this
court
is
not
bound
to
--
to
release
him
immediately.
this
court
has
a
right
under
the
--
under
the
habeas
corpus
act
to
make
such
provision
as
is
just
and
proper
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
there's
a
case
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
two
or
three
of
them,
where
a
man
was
held
and
i'll
just
go
with
the
rest
and
then
i
--
i
must
stop
but
i
--
i'll
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
this
--
this
is
a
rather
late
case.
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
it,
your
honor,
but
in
that
case,
a
--
a
--
an
individual
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
state
court
of
colorado
and
after
the
conviction,
that
is
after
the
event,
the
punishment
code
was
changed
and
obviously
the
change
of
the
punishment
code,
it
became
--
it
was
an
ex
post
facto
law.
he
made
application
for
a
writ
in
the
federal
court
and
the
federal
--
and
the
case,
i
think,
it
came
to
this
court,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure,
the
writ
was
granted.
the
ruling
was
to
the
effect,
but
if
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
him
or
if
the
basis
is
illegal,
he
must
be
released
but
from
a
practical
proposition.
we
will
have
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
notify
that
the
exact
time
was
released
so
that
he
may
determine
whether
he
should
be
held
on
some
other
ground.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
it
was
--
it
was
issued,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
issued
and
the
court
added
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
the
--
the
writ
--
the
writ
was
issued
and
a
--
an
order
of
the
court
said
that
the
attorney
general
should
be
notified
of
the
time
and
place
of
his
release
so
that
he
may
take
any
action
he
sees
fit,
but
the
writ
issued
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
well,
it
isn't
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
referred
to
in
the
other
brief
or
not.
i
--
and
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
we
referred
to
it.
but
in
any
event,
what
we're
objecting
to
is
having
these
police
officers
breathing
down
his
back
all
the
time
when
the
lower
court
has
already
ruled
that
he
may
not
be
held
to
be
turned
over
to
the
japanese
government
for
trial
and
when
the
united
states
government
has
taken
no
action
with
respect
to
trying
him.
if
they
filed
court-martial
charges
against
him,
well,
certainly,
they
have
right
to
detain
him
under
the
manual
of
the
courts-martial.
the
--
it
is
not
necessary
for
our
position
to
go
as
far
as
asserting
that
it's
our
opinion
that
all
these
nato
status
of
forces
agreements
are
really
--
they're
unconstitutional.
certainly,
those
that
did
not
receive
senate
consent,
the
agreement
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
the
document
on
which
they
seek
to
turn
girard
over
to
the
japanese
government,
the
so-called
protocol
and
agreed
views
that
were
made
under
the
protocol,
was
never
submitted
to
the
senate
and
the
senate
had
expressly
stated
when
it
passed
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
that
that
would
not
be
oppressed
into
any
further
agreements.
now,
at
least,
they
could
have
been
done
if
it
is
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
strip
our
soldiers
overseas
of
the
benefits
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
least
they
could
have
been
done
would
have
been
to
submit
this
so-called
protocol
to
the
senate
to
see
if
they
wanted
to
change
their
original
mandate.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
know.
i
think
it's
similar
but
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
mr.
carroll
would
take
that
up.
he
--
he's
probably
more
familiar.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
i
--
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
i
--
i
didn't
say
that.
if
--
if
my
words
were
such,
your
honor,
i
--
i
withdraw
it.
i
--
i
would
have
intend
to
say
anything
of
that
nature.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no
question
about
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
oh,
no,
there
--
there
was
no
intention
to
reflect
on
--
on
the
solicitor
general.
what
i
said,
if
i
recall
correctly,
was
that
certain
senators
and
certain
congressmen
in
these
congressional
hearings
have
said
in
substance
that
the
government
witnesses,
which
appeared
before
us,
gave
testimony
which
was
misleading
and
confusing
both
on
law
and
on
fact.
i
think
--
i
think
the
record
will
bare
that
and
i
--
i
made
no
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
if
--
if
even
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
your
honor,
if
even
there
was
such
an
inference,
i
offer
my
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
apologies
to
this
court
and
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
because
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
something
--
mr.
joseph
s.
robinson
--
something
may
have
been
said
in
the
heat
of
argument,
certainly
no
such
intention
because
i
don't
know
that.
all
--
all
i
know
was
what
--
what
the
--
what
certain
senators
and
congressmen
said
in
the
record
but
i
don't
think
there
was
any
specific
reference
to
mr.
rankin
as
such.
and
--
and
i
apologize
for
--
for
conveying
any
such
impression,
the
impression
which
your
honor
says
was
conveyed.
thank
you.
