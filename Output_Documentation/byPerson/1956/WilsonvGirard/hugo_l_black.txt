justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
understand
the
--
your
position
there.
how
could
it
be
in
the
line
in
the
performance
of
his
official
duty
unless
it
was
done
in
allegiance
and
expressed
or
an
implied
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
in
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
soldier's
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
in
the
performance
of
his
official
duty.
what
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
what
you
are
contending
is
that
he
went
further
than
he
should
have
gone
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
guarding
and
shot
what
he
shouldn't
have
shot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
they
occur?
did
they
occur
on
some
base
occupied
by
foreign
troops
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
was
wondering
if
they
were
similar
unless
that
were
the
case.
do
we
have
any
such
situation
in
this
country
as
there
is
in
japan
for
the
rest
of
our
troops?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
had
in
mind
was
that
we
have
in
this
print
here
or
has
there
been
in
this
country,
foreign
troops
on
a
base
where
the
foreign
troops
are
required
to
guard
the
base
inside
the
base
and
where
a
soldier
has
been
put
out
on
guard
duty
to
guard
a
point
on
the
base.
and
where
they
were,
under
those
circumstances,
the
--
this
country
has
claimed
the
right
to
try
this
foreign
soldier
who
has
injured
or
killed
some
american
who
had
reached
the
base.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
substantial
to
what
occurred
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
under
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
with
regard
to
--
was
he
to
guard
that
area
in
which
the
weapons
were
located?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
base
occupied
by
the
troops
of
two
different
countries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
use
it
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
a
firing
area?
justice
hugo
l.
black
practice
firing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
then
the
duty
while
that
was
going
on
of
someone
to
guard
the
gun
at
that
point
from
other
people
and
the
government
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
include
guarding
this
particular
shell?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
--
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
the
case
--
would
the
case
be
different
in
your
judgment
if
the
man
had
been
given
an
express
order,
the
soldier
had
been
given
express
order
that
was
conceded?
to
guard
this
point,
keep
anybody
from
getting
the
shell.
they
only
dispute
but
further,
he
went
further
than
his
judgment
that
then
good
judgment
require?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
would
the
fact
that
there
is
a
general
immunity
so
that
japan
could
try
if
they
can
get
it?
would
that
be
decisive
in
connection
with
whether
it
was
the
duty
of
--
of
this
country's
commander
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
had
ordered
him
to
do
something,
to
protect
him
so
far
as
they
could
from
being
tried
in
another
country
for
that
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
there
be
any
difference
in
the
duty
of
the
commanding
officer
who
had
required
him
to
--
to
do
a
specific
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
point
of
my
inquiry
was
that
the
government
have
to
stand
or
does
it
stand
at
all
on
the
proposition.
a
soldier
who's
carried
into
a
foreign
country,
given
orders
to
obey
orders
and
does
obey
orders.
that
the
country
then
has
the
right,
that
the
commanding
officers
have
the
right
after
he's
obeyed
their
orders
and
done
what
they
said
and
turn
him
over
to
a
foreign
country
to
try
him
for
having
obeyed
the
orders
of
his
commanding
officer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
be
enough
under
those
circumstances
for
the
government
merely
to
get
a
provision
to
try
to
protect
when
he
had
the
power
to
protect
the
soldier
from
them
anyhow
for
obeying
an
order?
that
is
why
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
the
government
is
required
to
stand
at
all
on
the
basis
that
if
a
soldier
is
carried
to
japan
or
any
other
country,
obeys
orders
for
which
he
could
be
court-martialed
if
he
disobeyed,
the
government
can
then
--
authorities
can
then
turn
him
over
voluntarily
on
any
basis
to
be
tried
by
another
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
go
from
that
(inaudible)
to
the
position
that
the
government
would
have
a
right
to
subject
the
soldiers
being
tried
by
another
country
for
obeying
the
orders
of
his
commanding
officer
by
which
he
could
then
court-martial
if
he
disobeys?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
can
get
it
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
can
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
provision
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
treaty
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
which
bearing
our
name
that
is
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
commit
trial
by
the
japanese?
justice
hugo
l.
black
referring
to
the
disposition
of
soldiers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
agreement
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
an
administrative
agreement
between
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--where
is
the
provision
now
in
the
agreement
on
which
you
specifically
relied
(inaudible)
the
page
is
what,
for
the
specific
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
got
plenty
of
details.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
is
it
written
on
that
that
shows
that
congress
when
it
looked
at
this
agreement
knew
that
it
was
agreed
that
a
soldier
who
was
charged
for
some
offense
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
could
be
tried
by
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
it
given
in
this
treaty
for
this
agreement.
that's
what
i
understood
you
said.
where
was
it
given?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
it
given
in
the
agreement
if
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
also
provide
a
good
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
have
to
have
the
nato
extension
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
your
theory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
you
reading
from
that
congressional
record?
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
h.j
.res.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
dispute
that
interpretation
of
the
protocol
if
it
is
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
it
does
not
flow
from
the
protocol
assuming
its
validity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
if
you
assume
that
you
admit
and
agree
that
the
right
--
that
japan
tried
the
soldier
close
from
the
protocol,
your
problem
is
as
to
the
validity
of
the
protocol.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
you
do
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
you
haven't
discussed
it
yet,
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
--
did
you
challenge
it
only
on
a
constitutional
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
seems
to
me
like
if
--
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
if
that's
the
point
that
you
need
to
cover
or
somebody
needs
to
cover
on
your
side
whether
or
not
that
you
say
you
challenged
its
validity,
you
challenge
it
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
does
not
authorize
it
or
the
treaty
does
not
authorize
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
to
be
discussed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
discuss
it
on
the
basis
of
its
unconstitutionality,
but
after
you
point
out
why
you
think
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
that
there
is
a
provision
for
exclusive
jurisdiction,
which
can
be
waived
in
the
administrative
agreement,
do
you
challenge
the
validity
of
the
administrative
agreement
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
authorized
by
the
senate
and
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
of
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
it
true
that
the
protocol
contains
word
for
word
the
status
of
forces
covenant
of
the
nato
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
correct.
the
government
must
agree
and
stipulate
it
that
this
man
was
accurate.
i
mean
the
official
duty
has
resumed
within
the
meaning
of
this
definition.
the
definition
is
it
would
not
be
official
duty
if
he
had
deviated
from
--
from
his
job
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
they
have
stipulated
that's
the
official
duty
in
connection
with
the
meaning
which
the
army
has
given
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
department
of
justice
didn't
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
in
the
history
that
indicated
that
it
was
intended
by
the
change
to
make
it
applicable
so
as
to
turn
over
people
to
foreign
countries?
