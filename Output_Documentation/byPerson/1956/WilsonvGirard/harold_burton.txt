and
if
it
were
not
in
the
line
of
duty
by
then
it
is
considered
that
it
was
the
primary
jurisdiction
was
liable
to
japan,
is
that
right?
justice
harold
burton
you
point
out
in
this
case
that
waiver
and
if
the
waiver
is
valid,
all
this
controversy
drops
out
of
sight
doesn't
it?
justice
harold
burton
and
then
didn't
the
treaty
itself
provide
that
same
things
would
have
to
be
done
by
administrative
agreements?
justice
harold
burton
in
your
brief,
you
also
make
the
point
do
you
not
that
the
treaty
itself
provided
not
merely
that
there's
going
to
be
the
administrative
agreement
as
to
disposition
of
truth.
but
the
administrative
agreement
was
to
cover
and
determine
conditions
which
shall
govern
this
provision
of
truth,
giving
it
more
than
disposition.

they
had
been
signed
in
1951
for
a
long
time
before
this
was
pending.
and
when
was
it
actually
acted
upon
by
the
senate
as
a
treaty?
justice
harold
burton
but
it
was
back
acted
on
fully
as
a
treaty
by
the
senate
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
mr.
robinson,
in
your
brief,
the
first
case
that
you
cited,
the
schooner
exchange
case
in
support
of
your
--
of
your
proposition
--
justice
harold
burton
and
the
other
side
cites
the
same
case.
justice
harold
burton
you
refer
to
them
as
agreement
not
as
a
treaty,
was
it
not?
justice
harold
burton
the
nato
--
the
--
justice
harold
burton
--
nato
status
of
forces?
justice
harold
burton
but
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
was
a
treaty,
was
it
not?
justice
harold
burton
well,
there
were
difference
of
opinion
in
the
senate
about
that
treaty
but
it
was
adopted
by
a
two-thirds
vote,
was
it
not?
