justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
it's
maybe
actually
the
same
question
but
i
think
you
told
us
that
in
cases
within
primary
japanese
jurisdiction,
they've
actually
surrendered
in
97%
i
think
you
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
--
which
is
to
say
then,
they
send
those
soldiers
over
to
our
forces
for
court-martial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
since
the
status
of
forces
agreements,
we
have
had
foreign
troops
stationed
to
this
country,
have
we
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
some
of
them
had
gotten
in
difficulties
of
one
kind
or
another?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
have
we
done?
have
we
tried
them
or
have
we
turned
them
over
to
their
nations
for
court-martial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
--
what
--
what
i'm
thinking
of,
in
our
own
country
where
the
foreign
troops
has
been
involved
in
incidents,
which
ordinarily
would
have
been
exclusively
for
disposition
in
american
courts.
have
we
disposed
of
them
in
american
courts
or
have
we
turned
them
over
to
the
nations
for
court-martial,
as
you
tell
as
the
japanese
had
done
in
97.5%
of
their
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
would
pending
to
the
coming
into
effect
of
the
status
of
forces
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
one
--
one
other
thing,
mr.
solicitor,
did
you
suggest
that
in
the
discussion
of
the
treaty
itself,
the
security
treaty,
in
article
iii
and
more
particular,
is
the
language
shall
govern
the
disposition
of
armed
forces
that
there
is
something
in
the
debates
or
community
hearings
or
something
which
indicates
that
the
congress
included
within
disposition
of
the
armed
forces
these
matters
covered
by
the
administrative
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
can
suggest
this
recognition
that
--
that
that
was
the
kind
of
administrative
agreement
dealing
with
"the
disposition
of
armed
forces?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
was
that
in
the
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1955.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
told
us
earlier
we
were
going
--
refer
to
some
authorities
who
supported
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
know.
i
--
you
said
earlier,
i
think,
that
you
would
refer
us
to
some
authorities
who
supported
that
proposition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
just
stated
that
the
proposition
was,
it
was
an
absolute
immunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
only
authority
you
have
in
that
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
agree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
who
put
it
in?
that's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
it
appear?
you
have
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
going
to
find
out
who
put
that
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
in
view
of
that
would
be
so
that
it
says
that
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
accused
of
an
offense
against
civil
authority
may
be
delivered
upon
request
to
the
civil
authority
at
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
mr.
carroll's
last
argument
as
i
understood
it
was
in
effect
that
the
position
the
government
has
taken
as
to
the
conduct
of
girard
being
in
performance
of
his
duty
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
shows
that
the
government
would
not
consider
or
the
military
would
not
consider
this
a
violation
of
the
military
code,
this
incident,
which
would
subject
girard
to
court-martial
charges,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there's
nothing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
there's
nothing
in
the
government's
position,
that's
what
i
want
to
get
clear
to
the
effect
that
he
would
not
be
subject
to
court-martial
charges
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
event,
he
was
not
specific.
