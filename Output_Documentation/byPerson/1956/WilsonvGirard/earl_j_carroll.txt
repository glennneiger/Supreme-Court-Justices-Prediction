mr.
earl
j.
carroll
thank
you.
well,
i
see
my
time
is
a
little
more
limited
than
i
anticipated.
i
will
try
to
cover
them
all.
i
think
largely
the
argument
has
gotten
a
little
off
field
of
--
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
case,
which
to
me
appear
to
be
very
simple
issues.
there
are
a
couple
of
questions
that
i
want
to
answer
that
i
made
notes
about
and
i
think
perhaps
before
i
get
into
the
issues,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
last
question
that
was
asked
having
to
do
with
the
identity
of
language
between
the
nato
agreement
and
this
agreement.
well,
one
of
the
big
troubles
in
this
case
which
has
not
been
brought
out
has
been
this.
there
--
substantially,
the
language
is
the
same
as
to
official
duties,
but
the
claim
of
the
japanese
is
based
upon
an
alteration
of
the
term
"official
duties"
as
altered
in
the
so-called
agreed
views.
now,
if
anybody
ever
heard
of
agreed
views
as
a
means
of
international
law,
well,
they
are
way
ahead
of
me,
but
in
the
hearing,
before
the
subcommittee
of
the
armed
services
and
i
think
it's
attached
as
an
exhibit
in
this
particular
manner,
your
honors
will
find
just
what
has
happened
on
page
17.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
before
the
court
and
--
no,
this
is
in
the
hearing
of
the
subcommittee
on
armed
services
before
the
united
states
senate.
now,
in
these
hearings
on
page
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
yes,
on
this
matter,
on
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
now,
mr.
dechert
from
the
defense
department
outlines
in
that,
the
entire
history
of
the
documents
involved.
now,
these
documents
as
it's
outlined
in
our
brief
are
--
are
as
follows.
the
--
the
peace
treaty,
the
multi-lateral
peace
treaty,
then
the
security
treaty,
then
the
administrative
agreement,
then
the
protocol,
then
some
minutes,
which
were
the
result
of
the
hearings
at
the
time
that
the
protocol
was
entered
into
and
then,
some
agreed
views.
now,
these
agreed
views
are
the
views
of
the
representatives
of
--
of
japan
and
ourselves
under
article
xvi
of
the
administrative
agreement
which
calls
for
the
appointing
appointment
of
a
joint
committee
and
the
language
is,
“the
joint
committee
shall
be
established
as
a
means
for
consultation
between
the
united
states
and
japan
in
all
matters
requiring
mutual
consultation
regarding
the
implementation
of
this
agreement.
in
particular,
the
joint
committee
shall
serve
as
the
means
for
consultation
and
determine
the
facilities
and
areas
of
japan,
which
are
required
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
in
carrying
out
the
purpose
stated
in
article
i
of
the
security
treaty.”
then
number
two,
“the
joint
committee
shall
be
composed
of
a
representative
of
the
united
states
and
japan,
each
of
whom
shall
have
one
or
more
deputies
and
staff.
the
joint
committee
shall
be
so
organized
that
it
shall
meet
immediately
at
any
time
at
the
request
of
the
representative
of
either
the
united
states
or
japan.”
now,
this
joint
committee
got
up
some
agreed
minutes
and
on
page
18
of
this
report
or
some
agreed
views
rather.
agreed
view
number
39
is
the
basis
of
the
japanese
claim
that
this
was
not
in
the
--
in
a
--
that
this
act
was
not
in
accord
with
official
duty.
now,
it
falls
squarely
within
a
definition
of
official
duty
as
defined
in
the
protocol
and
in
the
nato
agreements,
but
that
official
--
that
definition
has
been
changed
by
this
agreed
view
number
39,
which
reads
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
as
follows.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
no,
sir.
they
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
if
i
read
the
language
to
you,
your
honor,
i
think
you'll
see
how
it
changes
the
ordinary
accepted
meaning
of
official
duty.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
may
i
--
may
i
read
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
may
i
read
the
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
the
language
--
i
think
it
answers
your
question.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
yes
--
yes,
sir,
excuse
me.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
the
language
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
no,
the
--
not
--
not
other
than
in
the
language
that
it
--
it
stated
here
in
the
--
in
the
protocol
which
official
duty
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
no,
its
--
it
--
i'll
give
you
the
exact
phrase
if
you
call
out
that
definition.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
offenses
in
--
in
two,
on
25a,
offenses
arising
out
of
any
act
or
omission
done
in
the
performance
of
official
duty.
now,
that's
the
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
that's
from
the
protocol.
that's
the
amendment
to
the
--
that
is
the
amendment
to
the
--
the
administrative
agreement.
now,
that's
the
language
there.
now,
note
what
they
have
done
to
change
that
language
and
it's
based
upon
this
change
that
they
claim
the
right
to
have
a
--
a
draw
deliberate
demand.
the
term
official
duty
as
referred
to
in
paragraph
3
(a)
(2)
of
the
protocol
and
official
minutes
relating
thereto
is
understood
to
be
any
duty
or
service
required
or
authorized
to
be
done
by
statute,
regulation,
the
order
of
--
of
a
superior
or
a
military
usage
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
a
military
usage.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
no,
sir.
i
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
that
is
correct.
i
say
that
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
i
say
official
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
that
is
what
i'm
saying,
under
our
standards
of
official
duty,
under
--
and
recognized
in
our
military
service,
i
think
the
definition
is
very
clear.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
i
--
i
think
you
can,
sir.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
i
don't
doubt
that
there's
a
conflict
of
its
application,
but
there
is
a
definition
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
i
don't
think
so
when
they
restrict
the
definition
to
say
that
official
duty
means
something
that
a
man
is
specifically
told
to
do.
i
don't
think
that's
the
common
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
official
duty.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
have
to
recognize
the
language
and
the
common
--
the
common
understanding
of
that
language
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
very
issues
of
this
case.
this
--
this
language
to
an
american
and
to
an
american
soldier
in
particular
has
a
definite
meaning.
to
the
japanese,
it
doesn't
have
a
--
has
--
have
a
definite
meaning.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
oh.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
but
by
who,
the
joint
committee
or
some
--
subordinate
japanese
clerk
and
some
subordinate
american
clerk,
who
in
this
joint
committee
or
one
of
its
subcommittees
has
the
right
to
make
a
definition
that
has
the
effect
of
law.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
i'm
only
pointing
out,
your
honor,
that
the
claim
of
the
japanese
to
him
is
on
this
basis
of
this
amended
interpretation.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
what
you
say
is
true.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
one
other
thing
about
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
it
--
it
does.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
i
--
apparently,
it
does.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
source
of
it.
they
--
from
this
document,
it
says,
“united
states
armed
--
army
forces,
far
eastern
inc.,
united
states
army
(rear),
circular
22-1.”
now,
i
--
i
don't
know
the
authority
for
the
publication
of
this
or
who
published
it,
but
apparently,
those
two
headquarters
are
responsible
for
its
promulgation.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
i
think
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
i
--
i
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
think
your
honors
put
your
finger
upon
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
this
document
is
published
apparently
by
the
army
in
order
to
conform
with
these
so-called
agreed
views,
the
definition
of
official
duty.
in
other
words,
it's
much
more
restrict
than
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
word
official
duties.
that
phrase
as
it
is
generally
understood
is
much
broader
than
this
and
apparently,
your
honor,
i
--
i
can
only
--
only
speak
from
seeing
the
date
of
this
which
is
the
24th
of
january,
1956.
apparently,
they
on
--
having
in
mind
this
restricted
definition
of
official
duties
under
the
agreed
views
has
then
promulgated
this
to
--
for
the
army
to
conform
with
this
restricted
definition,
but
my
--
our
point
is
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
from
that
viewpoint,
of
course,
we
are
better
off.
your
--
your
honor
is
correct
and
that's
the
respecting
terms.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
they're
--
they're
bound
by
that
stipulation
but
i'm
pointing
out
something
else.
the
reason
i
pointed
that
out
was
an
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
language
was
identical
between
the
nato
treaties
and
these
treaties.
there
is
this
further
restriction
on
official
duties.
the
official
duty
phrase
in
the
nato
agreements
has
not
been
so
restricted
as
it
has
been
here.
that
was
the
reason
i
brought
that
matter
out
but
i
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
black
that
that's
the
--
that's
the
effect
of
the
stipulation
upon
the
part
of
the
government.
they
have
stipulated
as
to
the
much
more
narrow
viewpoint
because
they've
stipulated
as
to
their
interpretation
of
official
duties.
now,
we
have
in
this
case
a
very
substantial
question
of
--
of
jurisdiction
and
that
comes
about
in
connection
with
this
camp
weir.
now,
this
camp
weir,
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
the
brief
of
the
appellee
in
the
appendix
on
page
40a
and
41a
over
to
42a,
we
have
here
an
affidavit
of
this
--
of
robert
dechert
who
is
general
counsel
of
the
department
of
defense
and
he
tells
us
here
that
this
was
used,
this
is
property
that
was
used
by
the
japanese
army
during
world
war
ii,
and
he
tells
us
that
we
seized
at
any
states
and
it
was
seized
by
our
forces
on
april
the
11th,
1946.
it's
been
held
by
our
forces
and
then
used
by
them
as
an
army
base.
and
then,
he
goes
on
to
tell
us
that
the
facilities
and
areas,
the
use
of
which
is
to
be
granted
by
japan
to
the
united
states
of
america
in
accordance
with
paragraph
(1)
of
article
ii
of
the
administrative
agreement
signed
at
tokyo
includes
this
particular
property.
and
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
paragraph
(2)
on
page
41a.
it
is
confirmed
that
the
facilities
or
areas
indicated
pending
in
the
schedule
refer
to
those
facilities
or
areas,
the
continued
use
of
which
is
to
be
granted
to
the
united
states
in
accordance
with
the
notes
exchanged
between
mr.
katsuo
okazaki,
minister
of
the
state
of
japan
and
mr.
dean
rusk,
special
representative
of
the
president.
then,
they
named
the
camp
and
gave
you
the
number
and
they
say
on
the
following
page
under
that
same
paragraph,
the
notes
exchanged
between
mr.
rusk
and
mr.
okazaki
referred
to
in
the
agreement
quoted
above
provided
that
facilities
and
areas
used
by
the
united
states
prior
to
the
date
of
the
administrative
agreement
would
continue
to
be
used
on
the
same
basis
as
used
theretofore
until
a
formal
agreement
was
reached
on
such
facilities
or
areas
or
until
such
facilities
or
areas
were
released
by
the
united
states.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
to
have
in
mind
that
theretofore
this
area
was
used
by
the
united
states
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
that
area.
and
here,
they
have
contracted
to
give
us
the
continued
use
of
this
on
the
same
basis
as
we
previously
have
the
use
of
this
particular
maneuvering
camp
area
and
--
and
--
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
issue
with
the
solicitor
general,
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
facts
stated
herein
that
this
property
was
exclusively
under
the
jurisdiction
and
granted
exclusively
to
the
united
states.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
by
virtue
of
--
but
--
not
by
virtue
of
the
administrative
agreement
alone
but
by
virtue
of
the
contract
that
we
entered
into
for
the
use
of
these
properties
if
you
will
read
further
in
this
agreement.
it
says,
“no
formal
agreement
has
ever
been
reached
on
camp
weir
maneuver
area
because
the
japanese
and
united
states
representatives
of
the
joint
committee
have
not
been
able
to
reach
an
agreement
on
the
exact
boundaries
of
the
area.”
the
dispute
over
boundaries
arises
principally
from
the
japanese
demand
that
areas
encroached
upon
by
local
farmers
to
be
released
from
the
maneuver
area.
at
sometime
late
1951
or
early
1952,
the
united
states
agreed
to
permit
the
national
safety
police
which
later
became
the
japanese
self-defense
force
to
use
certain
portions
of
--
of
camp
weir
maneuver
area
for
an
artillery
and
army
school.
this
agreement
provided
that
the
national
safety
police
would
be
required
to
vacate
the
premises
on
60
days
notice
by
the
united
states.
a
new
agreement
containing
the
same
60-day
vacate
notice
provision
was
effected
on
march
30th,
1954.
this
agreement
was
terminated,
effective
october
15th,
1954
by
notice
--
by
giving
notice
to
vacate
on
august
12,
1954,
and
i
skip
to
the
last
sentence,
at
the
time
of
the
girard
incident,
the
area
was
being
used
solely
by
the
united
states
forces.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
i
don't
think
--
well,
i
--
yes,
it
was
subject
to
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
the
terms
of
the
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
that
is
correct,
but
you
see,
these
--
these
agreements,
if
i
can
use
the
term,
are
very
weasel-worded
to
say
the
least.
it's
very
difficult
to
--
to
know
exactly
what
they
mean
until
you
go
into
them
in
--
in
some
detail.
now,
let's
take
the
security
treaty,
the
security
treaty
in
connection
and
prior
to
this
particular
camp,
the
security
treaty
language
states
that
japan
--
there
is
danger
to
--
in
japan
--
in
japan
in
this
situation
and
japan
desires
a
security
treaty
with
the
united
states.
japan
desires
as
a
provisional
arrangement
for
its
defense
that
the
united
states
of
america
should
maintain
the
armed
forces
of
its
own
in
and
about
japan
so
as
to
deter
on
the
attacks
upon
japan.
and
then
on
article
i,
japan
grants
and
the
united
states
of
america
accepts
the
right
upon
the
coming
into
force
of
the
treaty
of
peace
and
of
this
treaty
to
dispose
united
states
land,
air
and
sea
forces
in
and
about
japan.
well,
that's
as
far
as
the
treaty
goes.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
there,
we
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
oh,
no
sir,
because
there
is
a
rule
of
law
and
it
comes
under
this
principle
of
uti
possidetis.
now,
that
principle
of
law
is
applicable
in
this
particular
case
where
we
had
an
--
where
you
have
an
area
of
land
and
the
authority
of
international
law
here
is
very
clear,
which
i'll
cite
to
the
court,
where
you
have
an
area
within
another
country
and
in
--
you
exercise
jurisdiction
--
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
that
area
at
the
time
of
the
peace
treaty.
if
the
peace
treaty
doesn't
make
a
contrary
provision
as
to
that
area,
then
you
continue
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
and
the
other
country
has
waived
its
right
to
reassert
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
area.
well,
that's
a
rule
of
international
law
that
falls
under
this
doctrine
of
uti
possidetis
and
the
authorities
for
that,
i
--
i
will
just
briefly
submit
to
the
court,
the
--
and
--
and
we
--
i
just
don't
have
time
to
differentiate
this
from
the
things
that
you
surrender
as
the
military
act,
but
by
the
principle,
and
this
is
whole
on
international
law,
the
seventh
edition,
599,
by
the
principle
commonly
called
uti
possidetis
is
understood
that
the
simple
conclusion
of
peace,
if
no
expressed
stipulation
accompanies
it
or
insofar
as
expressed
stipulations
do
not
extend
this
and
the
two
belligerence
as
absolute
property,
whatever
they
respectively
have
had
under
their
actual
control
in
the
case
of
territory
and
things
attached
to
it
in
the
--
and
in
the
case
of
(inaudible),
whatever
they
have
in
their
legal
possession
at
the
moment,
occupied
territory,
for
example,
is
transferred
to
the
occupying
power.
now,
the
cases
on
it
are
a
legion.
there's
a
number
of
cases
and
i
understand
from
the
chief
justice,
we
can
submit
these
in
a
memoranda
and
i
will
submit
the
authorities
on
that
point.
and
i
want
to
call
your
attention
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
their
cases
which
deal
with
the
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
--
retaining
the
same
rights.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
i
thought
--
no,
not
--
not
in
--
specially
dealing
with
criminal
jurisdiction,
but
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
the
general
rule
of
law
is
that
if
you
occupy
this
particular
area
and
you
occupy
it
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
condition
continues.
all
that
--
all
that
the
doctrine
uti
possidetis
does
is
--
is
to
continue
the
--
the
matter
in
the
same
status
of
which
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
conclusion
of
peace.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
whether
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
let's
just
take
a
look
at
the
--
at
the
peace
treaty
now
or
rather
the
--
the
administrative
agreement
and
see
just
where
--
how
this
falls
within
the
--
the
terms
of
it.
i
think
it's
on
page
--
i
think
it's
on
article
iii,
this
one.
now,
on
article
iii,
let's
--
on
the
administrative
agreement
on
article
ii,
first,
japan
agrees
to
grant
the
united
states
the
use
of
the
facilities
and
areas
necessary
to
carry
out
the
purpose
stated
in
article
i
of
the
security
treaty.
in
article
iii,
(1),
which
is
the
only
one
that's
printed
on
page
16a
of
the
brief
of
the
brief
--
of
the
--
of
the
government,
the
united
states
shall
have
the
rights,
power
and
authority
within
the
facilities
and
areas
which
are
necessary
or
appropriate
for
their
establishment
use,
operation,
defense
or
control.
now,
here
in
the
administrative
agreement
is
a
specific
declaration
in
article
iii
of
the
rights,
power
and
authority
of
the
united
states
over
the
particular
areas.
here's
an
area
which
we
had
full
authority
over.
here's
an
area
that's
transferred
to
us.
we're
continuing
in
its
possession
and
here's
article
iii
of
the
--
of
the
administrative
agreement,
specifically
recognizing
that
we
shall
have
the
rights,
power
and
authority
within
the
facilities
and
areas
which
are
necessary
or
appropriate
for
their
establishment,
use,
operation,
defense
or
control.
in
other
words,
this
article
distinguishes
a
difference
--
different
situation
from
offenses,
which
might
be
committed
outside
of
those
areas.
in
--
it
says
that
we
shall
have
all
the
necessary
powers.
now,
we
considered
it
necessary
to
have
on
our
military
bases
all
over
the
world
full
jurisdiction
and
i
--
i
feel
that
article
iii
brings
--
is
a
specific
recognition
of
the
acceptance
of
a
condition
which
--
which
had
previously
existed
on
this
particular
area
and
that
it
recognizes
that
we
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
insofar
as
that
area
is
concerned
or
any
other
area
that
was
similarly
occupied.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
well,
the
administrative
agreement
does
not
say
the
opposite.
i'm
--
i'm
reading
from
the
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
i
don't
think
that
was
ever
within
the
contemplation
of
the
administrative
agreement
because
article
xvi
reads
as
follows,
“it
is
the
duty
of
members
of
the
united
states
armed
forces,
the
civilian
component
and
their
defendants
to
--
to
respect
the
law
of
japan
and
to
abstain
from
any
activity
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
this
agreement
and
in
particular,
from
any
political
activity
in
japan.”
now,
it
only
says
there,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
members
of
the
united
states
armed
forces.
you
must
remember
that
this
agreement
went
beyond,
if
i
may
finish
the
sentence,
went
beyond
the
--
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
this
--
this
agreement
went
beyond
the
nato
agreements.
this
went
to
a
civilian
component.
this
agreement
went
to
a
civilian
the
components.
it
--
it
gave
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
united
states
not
only
to
our
armed
forces
but
to
civilian
components
and
to
defendants
and
the
only
defendants
that
excluded
were
japanese
defendants.
then,
the
question
that
was
asked
a
short
time
ago
about
the
fact
that
it
said
that
such
jurisdiction
may
in
any
case
be
waived
by
the
united
states
was
included
in
here,
but
who
is
here
to
say
whether
or
not
such
jurisdiction
may
in
any
case
be
waived
by
the
united
states
applied
to
the
soldier
and
of
the
--
of
this
matter
or
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
much
broader
group
that
was
encompassed
in
the
group
classified
as
having
or
which
we
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
that
provision
for
waiver
may
well
have
gone
to
any
--
one
of
our
civilians
or
one
of
our
soldiers
who
was
injured
out
on
the
streets
or
some
place.
but
in
this
case,
you
have
to
remember,
he
was
a
soldier
on
duty,
assigned
to
guard
duty
on
an
area
which
had
been
under
our
exclusive
jurisdiction,
on
an
area
which
we
say
under
international
law
we
--
we
retained
exclusive
jurisdiction
who
if
he
didn't
carry
out
his
guard
duty
was
subject
to
courts-martial
and
who
in
carrying
out
his
guard
duty
as
stipulated
to
by
the
prosecution
accidentally
injured
this
woman
or
killed
this
woman.
now,
how
can
we
possibly
turn
a
soldier
who
has
carried
out
his
duty
under
the
penalty
of
a
criminal
prosecution
by
our
own
country
to
turn
him
over
to
a
foreign
country
for
trial?
the
answer
to
it
is
going
to
be
very
simple.
if
one
of
the
members
of
the
state
department
turns
to
a
marine
guard
in
the
future
who
is
guarding
while
an
angry
mob
is
charging
down
into
one
of
our
embassies
and
he
says
to
him,
”shoot
them
when
they
come
over
to
threshold.”
the
marine
is
going
to
say,
“here,
shoot
him
yourself
mister,
i
don't
want
to
be
tried.”[laughs].
that's
going
to
be
the
answer
and
it
will
destroy
the
entire
morale
of
our
--
of
our
whole
military
service.
if
we
order
this
man
to
do
--
to
--
to
do
an
act
and
he
does
it
in
the
performance
of
his
duty,
he
is
entitled
to
have
our
country
deterred,
whether
or
not
that
was
the
proper
performance
of
his
duty.
and
i
want
to
just
call
one
more
thing
to
your
attention,
the
assistant
--
one
of
the
assistant
judge
advocate
generals
went
to
japan
and
was
asked
the
question
by
the
newspapers
or
any
court-martial
proceedings
have
been
brought
against
girard
and
his
answer
was
that
so
far
there
was
no
indication
as
to
any
reason
for
him
being
tried
by
courts-martial
and
that's
the
nub
of
this
whole
case.
girard
was
in
the
performance
of
his
official
duty.
the
army
decided
not
to
try
him.
the
japanese
set
up
a
clamor
to
try
him
because
they
don't
agree
with
our
definition
of
--
of
official
duty.
and
so,
we
are
now
said
--
we
are
now
told,
“you
must
turn
girard
over
to
the
japanese
because
the
japanese
don't
--
do
not
agree
with
our
definition
of
official
duty.
and
if
you
do
this,
it
will
destroy
the
morale
of
the
armed
services
of
this
country
probably
forever.”
now,
that's
the
--
that's
the
answer
to
it.
it's
just
that
simple
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
--
for
the
time
that
i've
taken
before
this
court.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
will
be
done.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
no,
your
honor.
i
just
like
to
answer
that
kent
case.
mr.
earl
j.
carroll
the
kent
case,
your
honor,
which
has
been
cited
here
takes
up
a
lot
of
page
in
this
brief,
is
simply
this.
an
employee
in
may
of
1940
--
i
believe
is
1941
of
the
state
department
and
in
the
embassy
office
was
found
to
be
engaged
in
espionage
or
at
least
turning
over
classified
information
to
agents
of
nazi
germany.
he
was
immediately
fired.
the
--
the
documents
or
some
of
the
incriminating
evidence
was
found
in
his
--
amongst
his
belongings
in
the
embassy
building.
he
was
fired
and
this
was
in
may
and
in
--
i
believe
either
august
or
september,
he
was
prosecuted
by
the
british
authorities.
britain
then
was
at
war
with
germany
and
we
were
not
at
war
with
germany.
the
case
stands
for
nothing
at
all
insofar
as
the
issues
of
this
case
are
concerned.
i
thought
that
point
should
be
called
to
your
honors
attention
and
i
think
that's
about
all
we
have
at
the
time
you
allowed
us.
