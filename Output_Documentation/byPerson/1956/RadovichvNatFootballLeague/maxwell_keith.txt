mr.
maxwell
keith
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
which
affirmed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
then
a
cross
complaint.
the
motion
to
dismiss
came
after
extensive
pretrial
discovery
and
examination
has
been
undertaken
by
both
sides.
the
issue
before
the
court
are
two.
the
first
major
issue
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
all
acts
of
organized
professional
football
be
outside
the
antitrust
laws.
the
second
issue,
which
is
of
great
importance
to
the
private
antitrust
action,
is
whether
or
not
a
private
party
must
plead
in
addition
to
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
an
injury
to
himself
arising
from
these
violations
that
the
public
was
adversely
affected
by
the
violations.
petitioner
complaint
concerns
a
monopolization
of
the
business
of
football
by
the
respondents.
it
alleges
that
they
had
a
plan
and
a
purpose
to
monopolize
the
business
of
football.
it
alleges
that
there
were
affiliation
agreements
entered
into
by
which
division
or
alliances
were
created
to
the
supression
of
competition
in
the
business
of
football.
it
alleges
that
this
division
alliance
and
various
rules
and
regulations
of
the
national
football
leagues
excluded
a
competitor
in
the
business
of
football,
the
all-
america
conference.
and
it
alleges
a
group
boycott
and
band
exercised,
upon
petitioner,
not
in
trying
to
seek
employment
among
the
constituent
members
of
the
national
football
league.
but
after
a
valid
and
bonafide
offer
had
been
made
for
his
services
by
a
member
of
the
pacific
coast
league
who
made
the
offer
requested
his
services.
and
thereafter,
by
means
of
black-list
and
group
boycott,
petitioner's
job
opportunity
was
denied.
petitioner
is
a
professional
football
player.
he
was
a
professional
football
player.
when
he
first
commenced
football,
there
was
only
one
league,
the
national
football
league.
he
played
with
the
detroit
lions
of
the
national
football
league
from
the
period
of
1938
to
1941
because,
thereafter,
he
was
called
into
the
navy
and
he
served
as
athletic
instructor
as
coach
in
the
navy.
and
upon
being
released
from
the
navy,
he
went
back
to
the
detroit
lions
as
he
was
compelled
to
do
by
reason
of
their
structure
and
played
with
them
in
the
1945
football
season.
and
he
received
all-pro
honors
in
that
season.
i
think
he
is
one
of
the
great
names
in
--
in
the
business
of
football.
now,
we
have
alleged
two
sets
of
defendants.
the
major
set
of
defendants
is
the
national
football
league.
we
have
named
the
defendants
the
constituent
members
of
the
national
football
league
who
at
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed
were
principally
located
in
the
--
some
of
the
major
eastern
cities
of
the
united
states.
in
1946,
they
placed
a
team
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
on
the
west
coast.
the
commissioner
of
the
national
football
league
is
named
as
the
defendant.
his
name
is
bert
bell.
we
have
named
these
co-conspirators
with
the
national
football
league,
an
affiliate,
a
divisional
affiliate
of
the
national
football
league
called
the
pacific
coast
league.
this
was
a
minor
league
operating
on
the
far
west
which
was
not
competitive
to
the
--
to
the
national
football
league
except
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
when
the
cleveland
rams
were
transferred
from
cleveland
to
los
angeles.
it's
alleged
that
these
two
set
of
defendants
combined
and
then
conspired
to
monopolize
the
game
of
football,
to
dictate
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
the
game
shall
be
played,
to
exclude
a
competitor,
to
suppress
competition
amongst
themselves,
to
place
football
players
in
a
condition
of
bondage,
and
to
the
ultimate
result
of
applying
rules
and
regulations
of
one
league
extraterritorially
into
the
city
of
los
angeles
upon
the
san
francisco
clippers
so
that
petitioner
could
not
obtain
employment
with
that
minor
league
and
the
--
in
that
effect
being
he
could
not
obtain
football
anywhere
in
the
--
a
football
job
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
we
have
alleged
the
elements
of
interstate
commerce
engaged
then
by
the
business
of
football.
they
have
mutual
arrangements
for
the
multistate
transmission
of
television
and
broadcastings.
they
are
an
interstate
business.
they
travel
constantly
and
continuously
between
the
various
states.
the
club
owners
of
the
various
leagues
contribute
$50,000
to
protect
their
franchise
with
the
national
football
league.
they
adopt
uniform,
player
regulations,
and
uniform
rules
applied
throughout
the
nation,
and
all
these
are
pleaded
in
our
complaint.
the
structure
of
football
is
such
that
--
mr.
maxwell
keith
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
coming
to
the
question
of
injury
momentarily.
i'm
going
to
it
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
maxwell
keith
the
--
the
question
of
injury
in
this
case
arose
under
the
following
circumstances.
as
i
stated,
petitioner
had
played
in
1945
for
the
detroit
lions
and
he
received
all-pro
ratings
from
all
of
the
national
wire
services.
accordingly,
he
was
contacted
by
the
owner
of
the
los
angeles
dons.
now,
the
los
angeles
dons
was
a
competitive
member
of
the
all-america
conference
and
he
was
asked
to
play
for
that
league.
the
complaint
alleges
that,
the
petitioner,
before
accepting
this
job
opportunity,
he
contacted
the
owner
of
the
detroit
lions,
mr.
fred
mandel,
and
asked
him
that
he
would
like
to
stay
within
the
framework
of
the
national
football
league
but
that
his
father
had
been
struck
with
a
dangerous
illness
and
had
recently
been
operated
upon
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
in
los
angeles
to
take
care
of
an
ailing
father.
mr.
mandell
refused
the
request,
and
consequently,
petitioner
was
unable
to
play
in
los
angeles
with
the
national
football
league,
and
subsequently,
took
the
job
opportunity
offered
to
him
by
the
all-america
conference,
the
los
angeles
dons
in
particular.
he
played
with
that
team,
the
los
angeles
dons,
in
the
1946
season
and
the
1947
season.
in
the
latter
season,
he
received
an
injury.
subsequently,
--
subsequent
to
the
1947
season,
he
was
offered
a
job
by
mr.
william
howard,
the
coach
of
the
san
francisco
clippers,
a
job
which
the
complaint
states
clearly,
was
--
as
a
player
and
as
a
coach.
and
then
the
complaint
alleges
in
great
detail
that
he
was
informed
by
mr.
howard
that
he
could
not
obtain
this
job
as
long
as
he
remained
on
the
reserve
clause,
on
the
ineligible
list
of
the
national
football
league.
and
it
alleges
that
mr.
bert
bell,
the
commissioner
of
the
national
football
league,
informed
mr.
j.
rufus
klawans,
a
defendant
and
commissioner
of
the
pacific
coast
league
that
severe
penalties
would
be
taken
against
the
pacific
coast
league
if
it
allowed
petitioner
to
play
on
one
of
their
clubs.
but
consequently,
mr.
howard,
the
coach
of
the
clippers,
informed
mr.
radovich
that
he
was
sorry
that
his
name
was
on
the
ineligible
list
of
the
national
football
league,
that
he
had
to
honor
it,
that
he
could
not
obtain
the
job
that
was
offered
to
him.
petitioner
petitioned
to
the
commissioner
of
the
national
football
league,
mr.
bell,
to
no
avail
and
was
unable
to
obtain
a
job
in
football
in
the
united
states.
now,
the
structure
of
football
is
such
that
there
is
a
commissioner
who
obtains
the
power
being
delegated
to
him
from
the
constituent
members
of
the
national
football
league.
there
are
approximately
10
club
owners,
partnerships,
and
corporations
who
joined
the
national
football
league
upon
the
payment
of
a
large
sum
of
money.
the
complaint
alleges
$50,000.
thereupon,
they
consent
to
be
bound
by
the
rulings
and
determinations
of
the
commissioner
of
the
national
football
league
and
particularly
involved
are
the
agreements
that
they
must
adopt
the
uniform
players'
contract
that
this
contract
will
reserve
a
football
--
a
football
player
to
the
one
club
for
life,
and
that's
beyond
this.
they
must
enforce
an
--
an
ineligible
list
so
that
if
a
player
can't
become
a
free
agent,
he
can
find
no
job
opportunity
with
--
within
the
structure
of
the
national
football
league.
now,
it
is
alleged
that
these
rules
and
regulations
are
not
only
applied
to
the
constituent
members
of
the
national
football
league
but
they
were
adopted
and
accepted
by
the
pacific
coast
league
in
the
far
western
portion
of
the
united
states,
so
that
in
effects,
these
rules
and
regulations
went
beyond
the
mere
rules
and
regulations
between
the
members
of
the
national
football
league
but
went
into
an
entirely
different
area
of
the
country
to
a
separate
league
which
was
a
computative
competitor
for
the
national
football
league
and
to
--
to
the
extent
of
depriving
a
member
of
a
league
of
the
services
of
a
player
they,
in
fact,
wanted
to
play
for
them.
now,
it
is
alleged
that
there's
--
the
pacific
coast
league
became
a
divisional
affiliate
of
the
--
of
the
national
football
league
in
1946.
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
los
angeles
rams
came
to
the
city
of
los
angeles
in
the
territory
where
the
pacific
coast
league
had
a
team
called
the
los
angeles
bulldogs
and
where
the
all-america
conference
had
a
team,
the
los
angeles
dons.
now,
the
answers
of
--
there
were
answers
filed
in
this
case
which
is
unusual
in
the
case
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
12
(b).
and
these
answers
define
the
exact
scope
of
the
area
of
competition
relating
to
the
promotion
--
competition
on
the
playing
field
as
the
defendant's
brief
can
go
at
great
lengths
to
words
that
this
complaint
concerns
strictly
matters
which
are
necessary
and
indispensible
to
the
playing
of
the
game.
and
yet
answers
were
filed
in
this
action
and
these
answers
define
exactly
where
this
line,
if
there'd
be
such
a
line,
be
drawn.
because
the
answers
admit
that
there
are
uniform
player
contracts,
the
answers
admit
that
the
constituent
members
of
each
team
--
of
each
of
the
league
agree
to
these
contracts.
they
admit
that
there
are
black-list
imposed
upon
players
attempting
to
become
free
agents
but
they
deny
the
black-list
on
petitioner.
they
deny
there
was
a
boycott
and
a
ban
in
interstate
commerce.
they
deny
there
was
any
affiliation
between
the
pacific
coast
league
and
the
national
football
league.
and
there,
they
have
drawn
their
own
line
as
to
what
they
consider
permissible
conduct
under
this
court's
ruling
in
the
baseball
decisions
and
what
they
feel
is
not
permissible
conduct.the
court
below
in
the
first
instance,
the
district
court,
ruled
strictly
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
it
did
not
believe,
it
did
not
allow
any
amendment
of
the
complaint.
it
cited
the
case
of
toolson
versus
new
york
yankees
in
the
federal
baseball
case
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
below
sustained
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
on
jurisdictional
grounds
in
which
it
had
some
trouble
with
and
also
on
grounds
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
the
cause
of
action.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
--
the
district
court's
ruling
came
after
toolson
and
before
international
boxing
but
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
came
after
international
boxing.
i
think
to
--
to
refresh
the
court's
analysis
to
this
problem,
we
recall
there
are
three
great
cases
involving
the
athletic
business
under
the
antitrust
laws.
in
1922,
mr.
justice
holmes
held
that
the
business
of
baseball,
as
it
was
conducted
in
1922,
was
not
interstate
trade
and
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
commerce
clause.
shortly,
thereafter,
on
a
complaint
by
a
vaudeville
agent,
justice
holmes
said,
“however,
the
question
of
interstate
commerce
is
a
factual
question
and
cannot
be
decided
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
when
there
are
bonafide
allegations
of
federal
jurisdiction.”
after
this
development,
the
second
circuit
in
1949,
in
the
prejudge
opinion
ruled
by
the
baseball
was
in
the
anti
--
was
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
overruled
the
motion
to
dismiss.
in
1953,
this
court
held
in
toolson
that
the
baseball
business
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
that
it
--
that
the
court
had
ruled
in
1922,
that
--
who
was
outside
in
effect
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
for
the
reason
that
congress
had
investigated
the
business
and
with
their
intensive
and
extensive
knowledge
of
the
business
had
not
passed
a
legislation
to
overrule
a
prior
decision
of
this
court.
it
was
ruled
that
baseball
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws.
last,
in
1955,
the
court
ruled,
however,
that
the
business
of
boxing
was
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
international
boxing
club
of
new
york.
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
first,
was
that
the
aspects
of
football
and
baseball
are
the
same,
and
therefore,
the
protection
given
baseball
should
be
extended
too
and
same
with
football.
but
on
this
question
of
aspects
that
this
is
a
--
a
question
of
fact,
it
cannot
be
stated
that
the
business
of
football
is
like
the
business
of
baseball.
there
are
important
distinctions
between
the
two.
the
important
distinction
is
that
baseball
operates
by
means
of
a
player
drafts,
by
means
of
a
draft,
a
--
a
farm
system.
and
under
this
farm
system,
large
sums
of
money
are
--
are
expended
on
a
baseball
player.
they
take
a
young
man,
they
give
him
professional
training,
professional
advice
and
they
develop
him
from
class
league
to
class
league
until
he
is
the
polished
professional
major
league
baseball
player
that
he
must
be.
this
requires
enormous
expenditures
of
money.
football,
however,
is
a
windfall
business.
its
talent,
its
player
talent
stems
from
an
already
developed
college
campus.
the
football
players
come
and
fully
prepared
to
play
professional
football
and
there
is
no
capitalization,
expenditure
of
time
and
money
on
training
a
football
player.
the
business
of
baseball
in
order
to
support
the
farm
system
under
which
a
major
league
club
develops
its
players
by
ownership
with
minor
leagues
or
by
affiliation
agreements
with
minor
leagues
and
traces
the
player
up
into
his
final
height
as
a
major
league
player
is
for
the
expressed
purpose
and
testified
purpose,
the
development
of
player
counted.
there
can
be
no
such
purpose.
mr.
maxwell
keith
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
below
based
its
decision
on
asking
itself
one
query,
whether
or
not
football
is
a
team
sport.
in
the
boxing
case,
this
was
not
the
query
that
was
asked
by
this
court.
this
court
asked
itself
five
questions.
the
first
one
was,
“had
any
court
ever
held
that
the
business
of
boxing
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws?”
no
court
has
ever
held
that
football
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
second
question
that
this
court
asked
was,
“could
the
stare
decisis
help
the
boxing
defendants?”
and
in
stating
that
the
hart
case
show
that
to
all
businesses,
athletic
or
otherwise
that
the
question
of
interstate
commerce
was
decided
in
the
federal
baseball
case
and
that
subsequent
developments
of
facts
in
the
use
of
interstate
television
and
--
and
radio
transmission
had
affected
and
changed
that
the
boxing
people
had
used
these
interstate
communications.
and
therefore,
it
was
at
we're
within
the
scope
of
the
sherman
acts
insofar
as
there
was
a
question
of
interstate
commerce.
and
likewise
the
football
defendants
have
used
extensively
interstate
transmission
of
television
and
radio.
then
this
court
stated
that
federal
baseball
did
not
hold
that
all
professional
sports
are
outside
of
the
antitrust
laws
so
as
to
preclude
boxing
in
the
same
statement
would
be
applicable
as
to
football.
then
the
court
asked,
“what
is
the
congressional
intent
involved?”
and
the
court
noted
that
there
were
three
--
three
bills
in
the
house
and
one
bill
in
the
senate
which
would
have
exempted
all
professional
team
sports
from
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
said
that
congress
had
specifically
refused
to
pass
legislation
and
have
said
that
the
boxing
defendants
were
asking
of
this
court
the
very
thing
which
congress
had
refused
to
grant.
and
it
is
submitted
that
football
people
are
asking
the
same
consideration.
they
are
asking
this
court
to
exempt
them
but
congress
specifically
would
have
immunized
this
action.
the
question
of
public
injury
was
also
raised
by
the
court
below
and
this
is
of
significance
in
the
private
antitrust
action.
there
was
no
requirement
under
the
plain
wording
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
where
a
private
party
who
alleged
that
the
public
was
somehow
injured
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
reads
as
follows,
“that
any
person
who
shall
be
injured
in
his
business
or
property
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws
may
sue
therefore
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
district
in
which
the
defendant
reside
or
was
found
or
has
an
agent
without
respect
for
the
amount
in
controversy
and
to
recover
threefold
the
damages
by
him
sustained
and
the
cost
of
suit
concluding
a
reasonable
attorney
fees.”
this
court
has
never
held
that
there
was
a
--
added
requirements
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
by
a
private
party
that
he
must
allege
that
the
public
was
adversely
affected
by
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
i
think
that
this
question
goes
to
the
very
heart
and
nature
of
the
private
action.
the
private
action
certainly
is
not
a
derivative
right
stemming
from
under
the
public.
and
it
is
more
than
an
ancillary
action
to
aid
the
government
in
prosecution
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
is
a
direct
right
granted
by
congress
to
allow
personal
redress
from
those
who
inflict
injuries
on
private
parties.
the
congressional
concern
of
this
act
was
with
the
redressing
of
those
who
were
oppressed,
who
are
ruined
by
the
type
of
combinations
and
the
type
of
monopoly
power
that
the
acts
in
general
condemn
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
court
erred
in
dismissing
our
complaint
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
prove
our
allegations
of
a
trial
on
the
merits.
thank
you.
mr.
maxwell
keith
may
i
state
but
i
doubt
if
it's
the
question
of
time
harassment
and
expense
that
will
deter
or
bothers
the
respondents
in
having
this
case
put
to
trial.
it
is
a
fact
that
there
has
been
extensive
pretrial
discovery
and
we
shall
prove
the
three
main
elements
of
our
cause
of
action,
which
may
not
be
limited
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
to
a
reserve
clause
issue.
we
will
prove
that
we
have
been
injured
as
part
of
a
plan
to
rule
--
to
ruin
the
all-america
conference.
this
conference
admittedly
is
not
a
constituent
member
of
the
national
football
league
but
was
engaged
in
a
trade
war
with
the
respondents.
we
will
show
that
the
agreements,
the
divisional
alliances
between
the
pacific
coast
league
and
the
national
football
league
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
promotion
of
competition
on
the
playing
field
but
were
simply
agreements
not
to
compete.
it
was
simply
agreements
to
give
nationwide
sanction
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
national
football
league
and
were
simply
the
means
of
(inaudible)
group
power
to
eliminate
this
league.
and
in
the
sense,
the
toolson
case
has
no
application
to
our
cause
of
action.
there
hasn't
been
a
trade
war
in
the
baseball
industry
since
1915.
there
was
no
attempt
to
state
that
interstate
commerce
was
affected
by
the
elimination
of
the
competitor
in
the
toolson
case.
there
was
no
attempt
to
show
that
there
was
a
desire
for
toolson
services
which
was
--
you
know
which
was
--
which
was
prevented
from
enforcement
by
a
boycott
and
we
have
those
practice
present
in
our
--
in
our
case.
as
our
second
element
we
shall
prove
that
there
was
a
group
boycott
between
divisional
affiliates
who
had
no
competitive
relationship
with
each
other
on
the
playing
field.
our
complaint
establishes
that
the
national
football
league
had
no
constituent
members
in
san
francisco
where
the
petitioner
was
requested
to
play
by
the
clippers.
we
will
show
that
as
to
the
national
football
league
there
would
be
no
problem
of
the
enforcement
of
the
reserve
clause
between
constituent
members
that
he
played
for
the
san
francisco
clippers.
they
never
met
on
the
playing
field.
as
to
the
pacific
coast
league,
we
will
show
that
what
for
this
divisional
affiliation,
he
would
have
aided
and
strengthened
their
league
if
they
really
wanted
to
become
a
major
competitor
to
the
national
football
league.
and
we
will
show
that
this
--
that
this
divisional
affiliation
as
set
forth
in
the
answers
of
the
respondents
caused
the
relation
of
a
traitor.
and
i
say
this
supression
and
discrimination
establishes
matters
which
are
necessarily
under
the
antitrust
law.
thank
you.
