was
baseball
an
exemption
given
by
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
not
have
to
(inaudible)
you're
allowed
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
reason
was
(inaudible)
case
to
make
sure
that
the
usual
(inaudible)
to
this
power
upon
congress
admissible
and
in
the
court
makes
--
put
things
into
it
as
to
what
the
(inaudible)
for
putting
things
in
or
taking
things
out
now
instead
of
statute
as
to
the
congress
has
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
baseball-football
decisions
as
to
none
of
the
states.
that's
what
you're
saying.
but
as
to
baseball
and
truth
to
(inaudible)
along
there
was
a
baseball
decision.
never
mind
whether
baseball
is
played
the
same
way
or
whether
they
have
the
same
incident
there
was
any
baseball
game
of
a
dummy
concept
of
a
baseball
game.
but
the
thing
of
football
game
until
today
and
therefore,
we
are
--
the
football
--
the
baseball
game
is
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
suggest
in
your
case
is
the
$10
determination
was
based
on
whether
or
not
you
take
into
account
the
peculiar
adaptability
of
land.
and
the
$10
was
found
was
based
on
the
ground
that
you
do
not
--
you
can't
say,
“we
merely
decided
that's
for
a
and
you
decided
for
b.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
valuation
on
the
principle
is
wonderful.
the
principle
is
another
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
didn't
think
about
baseball
in
the
baseball
cases,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
their
notion
of
the
conception
of
what
the
nature
of
a
baseball
game
is
had
no
relation
to
the
conclusion
that
was
essentially
local
and
merely
incidental
and
do
you
think
that
is
necessary
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
i
think
the
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
look
at
the
arguments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
to
baseball.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
toolson
case,
you
added
a
lot
to
it
because
it
wasn't
sufficient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
your
toolson
in
relation
to
baseball
wasn't
like
your
a
--
a
and
b
and
the
next
one,
c
and
d.
you
think
that
was
another
a
and
b
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
should
it
make
if
the
ball,
if
the
size
of
it,
you
just
have
to
decide
if
it's
--

felix
frankfurter

--
to
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
complaint
in
the
toolson
showed
much
more
than
the
complaint
in
the
federal
baseball
case.
mr.
justice
whittaker's
opinion
pointed
out
that
(inaudible)
the
federal
baseball
is
concerned.

football,
it
must
be
baseball
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
thinking
(inaudible)
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
baseball
is
baseball
--
justice

frankfurter
--
baseball
is
baseball,
the
federal
baseball
team,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
