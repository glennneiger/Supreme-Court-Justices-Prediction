justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
--
isn't
it
true
that
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
federal
baseball
went
so
in
on
the
ground
that
the
baseball
wasn't
commerce
and
they
didn't
reach
the
question
you're
talking
about
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
it's
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
when
judge
--
justice
holmes
talks
about
--
ruled
the
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
does
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
resting
your
case
awfully
thin
ground
because
if
i
understand
your
argument,
your
argument
is
that
you
don't
claim
any
general
exemption
for
the
antitrust
laws.
that
baseball,
even
baseball,
doesn't
have
any
general
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
you
rely
solely
on
the
proposition
that
the
type
of
contract
that
you
alleged
here
was
adjudicated
in
federal
baseball
as
being
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
you're
asking
us
to
hold
then
that
complaint
should
be
dismissed
even
without
a
hearing
on
what
this
contract
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
to
make
sure
that
i've
got
your
argument
straight.
as
i
understand
it,
what
your
saying
is
that
you
don't
dispute
that
football
is
a
sport,
is
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
in
that
respect
you're
in
agreement
with
the
government
and
in
agreement
with
your
opponents.
and
your
whole
argument
is
that
on
that
premise,
the
complaint
does
not
set
forth
that
it's
insufficient
to
constitute
a
cause,
or
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
that's
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
want
to
be
sure
of
that
because
the
--
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
quite
different
from
the
argument
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
was
addressing
itself
to
and
as
i
misconceived
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
say
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
that's
what
prompts
my
question.
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
you
were
not
contending
and
that
you
emphasized
and
want
to
make
it
clear
that
you
were
not
contending
that
football
was
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
and
that
is
the
reason
why
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
my
question
to
you
in
a
different
fashion?
supposing
this
complaint
had
alleged
these
reserved
contracts
or
these
contracts
in
more
detail
and
has
the
alleged
facts
which
clearly
brought
them
outside
the
scope
of
the
titles
of
contract
that
was
involved
in
federal
baseball.
would
you
be
here
in
court
now
asking
us
to
dismiss
the
complaint?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
to
--
as
to
the
type
of
contract,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
couldn't
make
this
argument,
would
you
--would
you
be
making
an
argument
that
notwithstanding,
all
of
that
but
the
federal
baseball
should
result
--
should
result
in
our
holding
that
football
is
not
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
like
different
to
me.
