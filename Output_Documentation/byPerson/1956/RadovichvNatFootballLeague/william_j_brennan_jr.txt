and
why
did

i
didn't
quite
gather
why

mr.
elman,
do
i
gather
that
your
argument
as
to
inapplicability
to
baseball
decisions
would
be
made
if
instead
of
the
football
league
which
were
dealing
with
a
softball
league
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
that
we
have
everything
that
we
have

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

today.

brennan,
jr.

wouldn't
make
this
the
same
light.
