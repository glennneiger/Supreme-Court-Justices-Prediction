mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
i'd
say
at
the
outset
that
as
far
as
football
is
concerned,
this
is
quite
a
serious
and
fundamental
case
and
that
we
approached
it
with
that
thought
in
line
i
want
to
assure
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say,
at
the
outset
that
boil
down
to
its
bare
essentials,
this
complaint
involves
a
rather
simple
proposition.
a
player
by
the
name
of
radovich,
he
was
under
contract
to
the
detroit
lions,
a
team
holding
a
franchise
in
detroit
and
a
member
of
the
national
football
league
under
the
terms
of
his
contract
was
required
to
report
for
the
year
1946.
he
was
told
to
report
and
instead
of
that,
he
admits
in
his
verified
complaint
or
rather
in
his
complaint
which
is
not
verified
that
he
negotiated
with
and
concluded
a
contract
with
the
team
called
the
los
angeles
dons
that
was
a
member
of
a
rival
football
league
and
a
salary
that
was
approximately
twice
what
he
was
receiving
for
the
--
from
the
detroit
team.
he
mentions
in
there
that
just
before
concluding
his
arrangements
with
the
dons,
he
contacted
the
owners
of
detroit
and
said
if
you
will
pay
me
what
this
rival
league
will
pay
me,
i
will
go
back
to
detroit.
and
they
told
him
that
we
have
a
contract
with
you
and
we
respect
--
we
expect
you
to
respect
it.
so,
radovich
ended
up
with
the
los
angeles
dons
and
played
with
that
team
for
two
seasons.
thereafter,
for
some
reason
which
has
not
yet
been
explained
in
the
pleadings
or
in
the
comments
and
that
has
been
considerable
comment
outside
the
record,
he
decided
that
the
all-america
conference
was
no
longer
the
place
for
him
and
he
made
an
effort
to
come
back
inside
the
structure
of
the
national
football
league.
now,
he
admitted
in
his
pleading
that
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
at
all
the
--
during
all
the
time
that
he
was
playing
for
the
national
football
league,
there
was
a
rule
that
said
that
if
any
club
has
a
contract
with
the
player
and
that
player
signs
a
contract
in
violation
of
it
and
goes
to
another
club,
he
is
subject
to
certain
penalties.
that
penalty
in
this
--
under
these
particular
circumstances
happened
to
be
and
was
a
five-year
suspension.
now,
he
claims
in
his
complaint
that
he
was
injured
because
the
national
football
league
with
whom
he
had
a
contract
did
not
take
him
back
despite
the
fact
that
he
had,
in
violation
of
the
contract,
go
on
with
another
team
and
played
there
for
a
couple
years.
now,
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
clarify
football's
position
on
the
antitrust
laws.
i
think
we
stated
it
rather
clearly
in
our
brief.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
is
the
issue.
the
complaint
which
i
was
going
to
get
back
to
in
a
moment
but
i
will
resume
just
to
pursue
it
to
its
prayer,
in
effect,
says
that
because
of
this
rule
that
was
invoked
against
radovich
because
he
had
decide
a
uniform
player
contract
that
have
the
rule
in
it
and
because
the
rule
has
a
--
a
sanction
to
it
that
if
you
violate
it,
you
are
going
to
be
suspended.
he
has
suffered
an
injury
that
those
restraints
are
restraints
in
violation
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
and
therefore
he
is
entitled
to
treble
damages.
now,
that
is
the
meat
of
the
complaint.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
there
is
that
allegation,
but
it's
not
very
clear
to
me
just
what
the
radio
and
television
has
to
do
with
radovich's
injury.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
there
were
no
facts
alleged.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
submit,
your
honor
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
in
that
connection
i
think
that
we
--
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
had
radovich
alleged
in
his
complaint
that
something
that
was
done
in
radio
and
television
injured
him,
he'd
have
some
type
of
a
cause
of
action
of
which
he
could
involve
radio
and
television.
the
only
purpose
in
a
complaint
of
this
type
in
bringing
in
radio
and
television
is
an
obvious
one.
it's
an
attempt
to
play
football
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
that
point.
i'm
going
to
discuss
radio
and
television
because
they
are
an
important
part
of
this
problem.
our
position
as
far
as
the
sherman
act
is
concerned
and
the
clayton
act
is
that
we
contend
that
football
has
no
exemption
from
those
acts.
we
have
never
made
that
contention
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
believe
that
football
--
that
baseball
hasn't
such
an
exemption
either,
nor
any
other
sport.
i
think
that
the
federal
baseball
case
did
not
say
that
the
act
gave
an
exemption
to
baseball.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
despite
toolson
and
despite
federal
baseball
that
baseball
today
could
not
combine
with
someone,
for
example,
to
restrain
an
interstate
business
such
as
radio
and
television
and
not
be
subject
to
the
act.
so,
it's
almost
the
same
situation
as
exists
in
relation
to
labor
unions
under
the
certain
circumstances
this
court
has
held
and
other
courts
despite
specific
language
in
the
act.
labor
unions
under
certain
circumstances
are
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
we
feel
that
we
should
be
involved
in
litigation
of
this
type
for
a
reason
that
we
don't
think
that
any
of
the
things
of
which
we
are
accused
in
this
case
restrain
interstate
trade
and
commerce.
now,
i'd
like
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
the
charging
part
of
the
complaint
which
is
found
on
page
9
of
the
record,
paragraph
iv
and
it
is
noticed
that
the
paragraph
numbered
12
ledges
in
statutory
language
that
the
defendants
have
violated
section
1
and
2
of
the
act
without
specifying
how
or
in
what
matter
or
making
any
statement
other
than
the
act
that
using
the
statutory
language.
now,
the
pertinent
part
is
found
in
13
under
the
--
on
the
same
page
in
which
they
--
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
to
--
and
hopes
to
set
out
and
does
set
out,
he
says
at
the
--
the
last
two
lines,
the
substantial
terms
of
which
agreement
and
the
means
of
the
concert
of
action
are
as
follows.
in
other
words,
we
have
an
unusual
situation.
in
this
complaint,
the
plaintiff
sets
out
the
means
by
which
the
so-called
conspiracy
was
accomplished
and
what
are
the
means
which
are
found
on
the
following
page.
they
consist
of
three
things.
the
fact
that
when
a
player
signs
a
--
comes
into
the
national
football
league,
he's
called
in
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
that's
page
10,
the
following
page,
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
he's
required
to
sign
a
uniform
player's
contract
that
that
contract
has
what
is
called
the
reserve
clause
which
in
effect
binds
him
to
that
particular
club
and
does
not
permit
him
to
sign
with
anyone
else
while
that
contract
was
in
effect.
and
see
that
if
he
does
violate
it,
he
will
be
black-listed.
of
course,
we
would
find
some
disagreement
with
the
term
black-list
but
for
the
purposes
of
a
--
of
a
matter
of
this
type,
we
have
to
accept
that
term
as
for
what
it's
worth.
now,
that
is
the
--
those
are
the
only
paragraphs
if
you
study
this
complaint
that
--
of
the
charging
paragraphs.
now,
our
--
our
position,
briefly,
is
that
these
elements
that
are
alleged
there
were
the
identical
elements
that
were
found
and
were
before
the
court
in
considerable
detail
in
federal
baseball
in
1922.
now,
counsel
said
that
it
was
his
understanding
that
federal
baseball
simply
held
that
baseball
was
outside
of
the
act,
without
consideration
of
the
--
of
the
inherent
nature
of
the
game
and
the
internal
operation
of
the
game.
now,
i
wish
in
that
connection,
and
that's
extremely
important,
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
our
brief.
starting
on
page
15,
we
attempted
to
layout
for
the
court,
the
history
of
this
federal
baseball
case
and
quoted
on
page
15,
you
will
notice
the
comment
by
the
trial
judge
in
federal
baseball,
the
district
court
judge
who
held
originally
in
federal
baseball
that
they
were
subject
to
the
act
and
that
they
were
a
monopoly
and
so
on.
then,
the
matter
went
to
the
circuit
court
and
we
turn
to
page
--
to
page
16
and
we
see
considerable
language
extracted
from
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court.
and
in
the
interest
of
time
i'm
not
going
to
read
it
but
i
wish
the
court
would
read
it
because
it
--
it
is
essential
in
a
consideration
of
this
case
to
know
just
what
the
background
of
the
ultimate
decision
was.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
only
three
or
four
lines
which
are
found
right
at
the
end
of
the
quotation
where
it
says,
"it
must
be
obvious
that
the
restrictions
thus
impose."
and
i'm
speaking
of
the
same
restrictions
that
of
which,
radovich
complains
relate
directly
to
the
conservation
of
the
personnel
of
the
clubs
and
did
not
directly
affect
the
movement
of
the
appellee
and
interstate
commerce.
whatever
effect
if
any
they
had
was
incidental
and
therefore,
did
not
offend
against
the
statute.
now,
we
drop
down
just
below
that
to
one
little
quotation
from
what
mr.
justice
holmes
said
when
the
matter
reached
the
supreme
court.
he
says,
"the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
went
to
the
root
of
the
case."
and
if
correct,
makes
it
unnecessary
to
consider
other
serious
difficulties
and
so
on.
now,
to
say
that
there
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
original
federal
baseball
case
the
entire
operation
of
baseball,
is
not
accurate
and
to
go
beyond
that
and
to
say
that
the
ultimate
end
of
that
case
in
great
part
did
not
depend
upon
a
consideration
and
a
finding
that
baseball
in
--
in
the
operation
of
reasonable
restraints
that
relate
to
the
conservation
operation
of
baseball
itself,
namely,
reserve
clause,
uniform
contract
and
that
type
of
regulation
are
restraints
which
are
reasonable
because
they
promote
rather
than
restrain
competition
among
the
members
of
the
league.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
submit,
your
honor
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
don't
know.
i
have
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
have
read
that
quotation
which
we
have
--
we
put
a
different
interpretation
on
it
for
that.
when
he
says
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
what
we
are
trying
to
do
--
what
we
are
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i'll
explain
it.
perhaps,
we're
in
agreement,
i'm
not
sure.
our
position
is
that
the
features
of
which
radovich
complains
in
this
action
are
the
very
features
this
--
this
court
have
before
many
years
ago
in
federal
baseball
and
held
to
be
restraints,
lawful
and
proper
and
having
a
proper
and
lawful
business
purpose
and
not
restraints
upon
interstate
commerce.
there
is
nothing
in
the
context
to
the
radovich
complaint
that
was
not
before
the
court
in
baseball.
now,
the
significance
that
we
put
on
that,
i'd
like
to
explain,
you
might
say,
“well,
what
--
what
does
--
what
does
that
mean?
what's
the
effect
to
that?”
now,
this
is
our
attitude
on
that
matter.
that
decision
remained
unchallenged
for
about
30
or
35
years.
the
toolson
or
i
should
say
--
represent
by
saying
along
came
gardella
versus
chandler.
and
in
the
--
in
that
case,
there
was
some
doubt
cast
by
the
circuit
court
on
the
question
of
what
this
court
might
do
as
far
as
baseball
is
concerned
if
it
reached
it
under
more
modern
circumstances.
the
case
never
went
any
farther.
it
was
sent
back
and
disposed
off
on
some
basis
unknown
to
me.
as
a
result
of
that
case,
it's
a
matter
of
record
that
within
a
few
months
we
have
the
radovich
complaint
on
file,
within
a
few
months
of
the
gardella
case
and
other
cases
that
have
since
reached
this
court,
the
baseball
followed
that
position.
this
court
have
before
it,
the
toolson
case,
directly
on
the
proposition
of
--
point
to
modern
circumstances,
radio
and
television
and
the
other
aspects
that
are
now
in
the
game,
30
or
35
years
later
require
this
court
to
review
this
matter
in
the
light
of
baseball
in
1955
rather
than
baseball
in
1922.
and
the
court
said
as
--
if
i
can
interpret
it
correctly,
that
because
of
certain
unusual
circumstances,
they
didn't
feel
that
the
matter
called
for
review
that
there
was
a
unique
set
of
circumstances
involved
and
what
were
those
circumstances.
circumstances
were
that
for
30
or
35
years,
baseball
had
been
allowed
to
develop
on
the
basis
that
federal
baseball
was
the
law
as
far
as
baseball
that
they
had
made
certain
large
expenditures
in
developing
their
operation,
their
farm
systems.
and
to
--
for
this
court
at
this
time
to
now
decide
that
they
were
wrong
25
or
30
years
ago
would
have
a
very
drastic
effect
upon
baseball.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
toolson
complaint
and
compare
it
to
the
radovich
complaint,
there
isn't
any
comparison
in
respect
to
the
allegations.
the
toolson
complaint
has
allegations
in
it
that
far
exceed
the
charges
against
the
defendants
in
this
case.
now,
there
was
another
facet
that
was
involved
in
that
decision
and
that
was
to
the
effect
that
congress
had
had
certain
bills
before
in
which
they
had
conceded
the
question
of
whether
something
shouldn't
be
done
legislative-wise
as
a
result
of
this
mulltiplicity
of
litigation
that
was
arising
now
in
baseball
and
the
federal
baseball
case
that
should
we
do
something
about
it
and
all
through
that
report
runs
this
reserve
clause.
the
reserve
clause
this
and
the
reserve
clause
that
and
inherited
baseball
as
a
reserve
clause.
you
could
spend
an
hour
reading
it
and
practically
every
page
talks
about
these
facets,
the
things
that
are
essential
and
fundamental
to
baseball.
now,
in
the
shubert
case,
this
court
said
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
that's
very
pointless
before
baseball.
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
baseball,
they
had
a
draft
system.
they
still
have
a
draft
system.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
under
which
--
let's
take
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
there
are
number
of
other
rules
in
baseball.
i
don't
think
that
baseball
to
answer
your
question
directly
has
a
draft
of
that
nature
in
--
in
a
sandlot
situation.
in
other
words,
i
think
a
boy
originally
can
decide
with
only
he's
going
to
sign.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
but
there
are
many
more
assets
and
aspects
of
baseball
that
is
of
far
more
integrated
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
operation
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
football
ever
was.
for
example
--
for
example,
most
are
or
at
least
a
substantial
part
of
the
football
players
and,
of
course,
we're
way
off
of
the
record
now
and
certainly
off
in
the
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
record
in
this
case.
but
a
substantial
part
of
the
football
players
today
were
never
drafted.
they
were
picked
up
and
signed
as
free
agents.
now,
i
mean
you
can
get
down
the
roster
of
any
of
these
clubs
to
determine
that.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
may
i
explain
my
position
on
that?
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
thought
i
made
it
clear.
the
first
time
we
had
any
statement
of
the
word
"draft"
in
this
matter
which
is
then
before
the
court
since
1949
was
two
days
ago
when
we
got
a
reply
brief
and
the
word
"draft"
appeared.
it
is
not
in
the
pleadings
and
as
far
as
i
know
if
it's
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
i
don't
recall
it.it's
--
it's
mentioned
in
an
incidental
way.
it's
certainly
not
in
the
complaint.
it's
not
an
element
or
something
of
which
radovich
complains
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
for
all
we
know
there's
no
showing
that
radovich
was
drafted.
now,
after
all
it's
not
football's
position
as
i
understand
it
that
the
matter
of
this
type
to
be
called
upon
to
defend
things,
accept
the
ones
of
which
they're
charged.
there
are
--
if
radovich
has
some
complaint
about
the
fact
that
because
of
the
draft,
he
has
suffered
some
injury.
i
had
to
give
a
thing
but
he
didn't
plead
that.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
that
would
be
a
factor
if
it
were
pleaded
in
my
opinion,
but
if
in
that
--
i
say
this
to
you,
your
honor,
the
complaint
in
this
case
pledges
competition
with
the
all-america
conference.
in
fact,
the
competition
was
so
good
radovich
ended
up
over
there
for
twice
the
same
amount
of
money
that
he
was
getting
from
detroit.
so,
this
question
of
monopoly,
i
--
i
don't
think
there
is.
i
think
even
under
the
pleading,
there's
no
monopoly,
proves
he
--
he
submitted
the
existence
of
a
rival
league
and
--
and
a
--
in
the
same
area
in
which
players
were
playing.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no,
he
is
not.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
he
is
not.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
--
i
may
had
mention
that.
there
is
no
allegation
on
this
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
complaint
that
this
league,
this
defendants
ever
did
one
thing
except
as
it
related
to
the
national
football
league
and
it's
subsidiary
or
affiliate,
the
pacific
coast
league.
the
all-america
conference
was
a
rival
league
and
remained
in
existence
all
during
the
time
that
radovich
was
involved
in
this
complaint.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
as
far
--
as
far
as
the
pacific
coast
league
which
was
a
minor
league
was
concerned
which
had
an
arrangement
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
with
the
national
football
league
like
--
just
to
say
why
the
baseball
had
an
arrangement
with
this
class
triple
a,
double
a
and
so
on.
well,
i'm
speaking
there
of
the
major
league
team,
the
one
in
direct
competition
with
the
major
league
professional
national
football
league.
there
is
nothing
alleged
nor
is
there
any
contention
that
anything
was
done.
there's
a
general
allegation
that
what
was
done
was
done
to
drive
them
out
of
business.
that's
just
the
one
statement
in
the
complaint,
but
there's
no
showing
and
if
you
look
at
the
circuit
court's
opinion,
the
circuit
judge
makes
mention
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
showing
here
or
whether
what
was
done
had
any
effect
at
all
on
the
all-american
conference.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
essential
to
his
complaint.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
say
this
to
your
honor,
if
that's
your
feeling
i
-
i
mean
i
think
you
should
weigh
it
in
this
--
in
this
respect.
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
develop
this
point
of
my
argument
which
is
quite
important.
the
complaint
alleges
that
football
started
in
1921,
it's
rather
unusual.
it
started
out
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
federal
baseball
case.
and
for
30
years,
football
has
been
allowed
to
develop
with
the
same
structure
as
baseball
and
no
one
has
questioned
that.
now,
the
argument
might
be
raised
that
the
hart
case
should
have
put
them
on
warning
as
was
said
in
one
of
the
decisions.
but
let's
analyze
that.
here's
a
group
of
football
people
organizing
a
football
league
in
the
light
of
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
that
a
--
that
another
professional
sport
of
the
same
general
nature
is
outside
the
purview
and
that
there
are
reserved
clause
and
a
uniform
contract
and
all
the
things
that
are
involved
in
that
are
proper
and
lawful
because
they
--
they
developed
competition
among
their
members.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no,
i
don't
make
that.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
--
i
say
that
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
situation
if
you
will
follow
me
that
was
the
situation
before
the
football
people
at
the
same
time
the
federal
baseball
case
was
decided
when
the
complaint
alleges
that
national
football
league
commenced
its
operation.
i
say
that
they
had
a
right
to
rely
that
if
they
followed
the
identic
pattern
as
baseball
as
normal
business
people
if
they
model
themselves
as
an
athletic
group,
leagues,
regular
scheduling,
players
on
the
contract,
uniform
contracts,
commissioners,
rules
and
regulations
all
of
--
all
the
same
layout.
what
--
how
could
anyone
honestly
say
that
instead
of
relying
on
federal
baseball,
they
should
have
relied
on
hart?
now,
all
hart
said
was,
“here
are
a
lot
things
in
the
--
in
the
theatre
business,
a
lot
of
restrictions.”
and
they
said
well,
those
are
all
proper
because
we
have
a
local
exhibition.
they
didn't
have
--
they
didn't
when
they
first
went
up
the
first
time.
they
didn't
make
any
effort
as
i
read
their
complaint
to
show
that
those
restraints
that
were
involved
in
the
hart
case
were
lawful
and
necessary
to
the
operation
of
that
business.
but
football
already
had
the
baseball
case
behind
it
where
these
things
have
been
held
to
be
reasonable
and
proper.
and
then
for
30
years,
they
developed
an
operation.
now,
we
have
a
lot
of
players
on
the
contract
and
everyone
of
these
players
that's
on
the
contract
that
has
some
little
court
in
his
background
has
it
--
if
this
matter's
reversed
and
set
back,
we're
going
to
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
baseball
was
in.
now,
i
can
impress
on
the
court
too
much
if
they
--
they
should
give
serious
consideration
to
what
would
businessmen
organizing
a
football
league
in
1921
which
is
the
language
of
the
complaint
and
which
is
not
in
dispute,
what
would
they
have
done?
here
is
a
football
war
going
on
that
was
well
known
to
everyone.
it
was
a
fight
between
the
old
federal
league
and
the
major
leagues.
and
in
that
case,
you
had
a
team,
baltimore
claiming
that
they
had
forced
them
out
of
baseball
and
they
ended
up
with
a
team
and
no
one
to
play.
those
were
the
facts
in
the
federal
baseball
case.
so,
these
people
say,
“well,
it
seems
obvious
to
me
as
a
businessman
that
if
we
model
ourselves
on
baseball
and
confine
ourselves
to
the
same
operational
layout
we're
within
the
thinking
and
the
principle
of
the
supreme
court.”
now
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well
--
well,
it
was
certainly
the
same
insofar
as
the
allegations
of
which
radovich
has
complained.
that's
my
point.
if
there
are
some
other
measures
or
rules
or
something
in
football
that
are
involved
that
might
make
football
slightly
different
from
baseball
in
some
internal
respect,
they're
not
involved
here.
why
should
we
be
called
upon
to
make
football
go
back
and
lay
there
everything
they've
done
even
though
radovich
doesn't
complain
about
it?
because
we
have
a
matter
that
has
been
passed
upon
on
the
three
fundamental
points
that
are
involved
here.
he's
only
complaining
about
the
things
that
federal
baseball
had
before
it
and
which
it
repeatedly
has
been
said
time
and
time
again
the
shubert
case
said
what
baseball
held.
it
said
it
upheld
the
validity
of
the
reserve
clause.
it's
in
the
opinion.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
toolson
case.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
that
is
correct.
now,
let's
get
around
to
the
toolson
case.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
think
we're
out
on
jurisdictional
on
grounds
also.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
of
course
i've
got
thrown
off
is
a
rather
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
oh,
we
couldn't
make
that
contention.
we
never
had.
we
just
finished
a
case
in
philadelphia
which
the
united
states
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
claim
that
certain
things
we
did
on
radio
and
television
were
directly
against
an
interstate
business
namely,
radio
or
television.
i
say
baseball
could
be
charged
with
the
same
thing
if
the
government
would
decide
that
any
--
any
organization
that
does
something
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
in
direct
violation
of
an
interstate
operation
could
fall
within
the
act.
i
think
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
this
court
has
held
that.
but
that
--
that's
not
the
same
in
saying
that
in
this
case,
we
find
ourselves
in
the
act.
i
--
i
say
that
our
jurisdictional
position
is
that
being
so
identic
with
the
situation
that
this
court
held
as
a
principle,
as
a
principle
in
federal
baseball
and
which
it
upheld
later
on
in
toolson
because
of
reliance
and
stare
decisis.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
you
certainly
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
you
certainly
didn't
disturb
it.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no,
it
said
without
examination
of
the
underlying
issues
i
agree.
but
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
my
point
was
by
--
whether
you
did
it
directly
or
by
indirection
in
effect
baseball
finds
itself
outside
of
the
sherman
antitrust
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--act.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
and
i
--
and
i
say
to
you
that
if
you
consider
what
we
have,
i
haven't
had
the
chance,
i
wanted
to
give
mr.
nordlinger
a
chance
to
say
a
few
things.
if
you
consider
what
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
and
it's
been
written
very
carefully
and
with
a
great
deal
of
thought
in
what
i'm
tried
to
say
today.
we
don't
feel
that
football
is
in
any
different
position
than
baseball.
now,
the
only
comment
that
could
be
made
in
that
connection
is
that
we
should
go
back
and
prove
that.
now,
there
are
findings
in
this
u.s.
versus
national
football
league
by
judge
brennan
which
is
a
district
court
case
in
which
he
speaks
of
the
unique
features
of
football,
the
need
for
these
rules.
it's
all
quoted
in
our
brief.
so,
there
is
some
background
on
our
operation
an
addition
to
the
complaint.
it's
set
out
there.
but
i
--
but
i
simply
say
in
going
back,
what
we
will
be
doing?
we
will
be
simply
trying
to
justify
the
very
things
that
which
have
been
approved
in
1922
in
baseball
because
that's
the
only
thing
of
which
counsel
complained.
he's
not
complaining
about
the
draft.
radovich,
maybe
his
counsel
is
but
radovich
has
certainly
not
alleged
in
any
part
of
this
pleading.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
this
complaint
had
alleged
something
that
was
not
involved
in
federal
baseball?
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
yes.
in
other
words,
i
think
if
--
if
there
was
an
allegation
here
of
features
that
something
that
football
was
doing,
that
this
court
had
in
a
long
time
ago
held
to
be
reasonable
considering
the
pattern,
the
type
of
operation
and
the
type
of
business,
we
couldn't
make
this
argument.
our
argument
is
if
this
is
the
identic
situation,
then
why
--
why
should
we
have
to
go
back?
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
think
our
position
is
pretty
well
stated
by
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
boxing
case
which
there
was
a
statement
to
the
effect
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there's
a
statement
in
there
that
says
that
when
you'll
find
a
situation
before
the
court
where
the
pattern
is
identic
with
federal
baseball,
there
shouldn't
be
any
reason
for
having
a
different
rule
for
one
sport
than
another.
now,
i
think
that's
our
position.
that's
what
we're
contending,
precisely
that.
i
--
i
would
like
the
court
to
tell
me
what
football
does
as
alleged
in
this
complaint
that
baseball
didn't
have
involved
in
its
decision
in
1922
and
--
and
the
thing
that
the
court
refused
to
review.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
comment.
the
argument
might
be
raised
that
football
now
has
radio
and
tv
and
there
was
not
radio
and
tv
in
1922.
but
those
aspects
were
not
sufficient
for
this
court
to
disturb
toolson.
in
other
words,
they
had
radio
and
tv
and
baseball
in
1953
that
they
didn't
have
in
1922.
and
the
court
still
said
because
there
was
a
species
of
reliance
and
because
of
the
background
of
this
thing,
we
will
not
disturb
it.
now,
you
can't
measure
football
if
we're
right
in
our
original
premise
that
federal
baseball
laid
down
a
principle
upon
which
football
had
a
right
to
rely.
then
radio
and
tv
in
1953
should
have
the
same
effect
as
it
did
in
the
toolson
case
for
baseball.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that
difference
would
be
in
our
favor
rather
than
against
us.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i've
no
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
there's
an
allegation
in
the
toolson
complaint
that
the
radio
and
television
aspects
of
baseball
provide
20%
of
the
revenue.
there
is
a
finding
and
an
exhibit
which
we
have
put
in
our
complaint
that
in
the
u.s.
versus
the
national
football
league,
a
direct
test
of
the
radio
and
television
aspects
of
football
for
a
period
of
three
years,
the
relationship
of
radio
and
tv
revenue,
the
total
revenue
was
a
little
over
4%.
now,
if
20%
wasn't
enough
to
warrant
a
reexamination
of
baseball,
certainly
four
point
--
some
odd
percent
shouldn't
be
enough
in
football.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
and
the
same
allegation
was
in
--
was
in
toolson.
i--
i'm
simply
saying
that
i
don't
know
that
that
would
necessarily
bind
this
court.
i
understand
that.
but
i'd
say
there
was
a
finding,
an
exhibit
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
u.s.
versus
national
league
which
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
to
the
effect,
that
within
the
last
year
or
so
when
that
decision
came
down
in
philadelphia,
there
was
any
--
a
finding
by
the
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
by
the
court
that
the
relation
of
revenue
in
tv
revenue
to
ordinary
revenue
was
four
point
odd
percent
against
20%
in
toolson.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
it
should
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
it
shouldn't
have
deprived
--
it
shouldn't
have
deprived
toolson
either.
he
should
have
had
the
opportunity
of
showing.
there
are
something
if
they
didn't
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
in
1922.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
that's
all
we're
saying
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
but
i'm
saying
that
if
you
lay
down
one
rule
for
toolson,
i
don't
think
it's
proper
or
equitable
or
justifiable
to
say,
"football,
you
go
back
and
tell
us
all
about
your
radio
and
television.”
but
toolson
despite
the
fact
that
you're
alleged
to
have
even
more
than
football,
you
don't
have
to
go
back
because
of
something
that
happened
back
in
1922.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
think
that
you
might
--
that
you'd
have
to
qualify
that
by
saying
that
if
in
the
first
decision,
the
first
hypothetical
case
that
you
quoted,
the
court
ruled
against
the
plaintiff
for
certain
specified
reasons
and
at
the
second
complaint
involved
the
same
reasons.
i
think
you
might
have
a
question
of
stare
decisis.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
res
judicata,
but
i
certainly
think
any
principle
that
was
established
in
the
first
case
would
apply
in
the
second
case.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
decision
in
federal
baseball
is
res
judicata
against
this
plaintiff,
sir,
but
i
am
saying
that
the
principles
under
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis.
if
there
are
any
principles
in
federal
baseball,
we
should
have
the
advantage
of
it
and
that's
all
we
claim
and
we
claim
they
are
principles.i'd
like
to
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
if
congress
had
stated
that?
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no.
i
mean
if
that
was
the
only
basis,
that
i'd,
certainly,
wouldn't
feel
that
we
could
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
think
that's
what
it
said
and
i
think
that's
what
it
meant
but
i
--
i'm
--
i
repeat
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
no,
i
think
that
i
ought
to
make
my
position
clear.
we
do
not
rely
to
any
great
extent
on
toolson.
we
rely
on
toolson
only
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
--
in
--
in
relation.
we
rely
on
federal
baseball
for
the
principle
that
federal
baseball
lay
down.
we
wrote
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
think
it
said
we
will
not
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
think
it
said
we
will
not
reexamine.
and
i
don't
know
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
i
understand
that.
i
--
i
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
well,
i
haven't
done
anything
to
football.
and
the
very
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
the
very,
the
very
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
the
very,
the
very
--
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
all
i
ask
the
court
to
reexamine
federal
baseball
and
to
show
me
where
there's
anything
in
that
case
that
says
that
it's
limited
to
baseball
and
baseball
alone.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
yes.
but
i
say
the
same
considerations
that
the
court
had
in
mind
despite
their
misgivings
about
what
they
might
have
ruled
initially.
the
same
consideration
should
be
given
football.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
marshall
e.
leahy
thank
you.
