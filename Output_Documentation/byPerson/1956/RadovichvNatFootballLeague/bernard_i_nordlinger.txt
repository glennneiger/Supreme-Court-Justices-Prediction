mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
if
it
please
your
honors.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
another
face
of
the
case
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
deemed
to
be
dispositive
of
the
plaintiff's
claim.
and
that
face
of
the
case
rises
on
the
basis
of
the
record
which
we
respectfully
submit
consists
at
this
point
of
the
plaintiff's
complaint
only,
a
far
cry
from
any
of
the
very
important
--
and
heretofore
discussed
subjects
on
this
hearing.
the
plaintiff's
complaint
was
characterized
by
the
court
below
in
a
very
simple
manner.
the
court
said
that
he
was
a
football
player
that
tried
that
--
that
broke
his
contract.
and
then
the
court
said
succint
paragraph
which
makes
the
case
and
this
is
really
mr.
radovich's
case.
eventually,
he
wanted
reemployment
by
the
detroit
lions
or
by
other
football
organizations
of
the
national
league.
but
he
says
up
to
the
filing
of
--
of
his
complaint,
he
could
find
no
further
employment
as
a
football
player
with
teams
affiliated
with
the
national
league
because
when
he
joined
the
los
angeles
dons,
he
broke
his
contract
with
the
detroit
lions.
so
we
don't
have
a
case
which
involves
anything
at
all
except
an
embittered
player
who
broke
a
contract
or
jumped
it
in
plain
language
and
wants
to
go
back
to
work
for
the
same
people
that
he
was
working
for
before.
the
court
below
says
on
this
face
of
the
case
distilled
plaintiff's
allegation
is
really
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
eliminate
football
leagues
not
affiliated
with
national
particularly
another
league
called
the
all-america
conference.
the
alleged
methods
would
be
control
of
players
by
the
reserve
clause
and
black-lists.
now,
in
this
respect,
the
court
says
this
and
i've
eliminated
several
unnecessary
words
which
do
not
change
the
sense.
we
doubt
that
the
alleged
means
is
legally
sufficient
to
support
a
conclusion
that
these
means
were
calculated
to
prejudice
the
public
or
unreasonably
restrain
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
says
we
failed
to
discover
again
eliding
some
inconsequential
words.
we
failed
to
discover
pleaded
that
any
league
was
ruined,
would
be
ruined
or
substantially
affected.
the
result
cannot
be
presumed
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
said
is
that
the
plaintiff
radovich
alleged
in
subparagraphs
a,
b
and
c
appearing
on
page
10
of
this
record
that
the
national
football
league
just
within
its
own
components
adopted
a
rule
that
says
that
every
player
had
to
sign
the
same
contract
and
that
if
he
broke
his
contract
without
just
cause
or
excuse,
they
wouldn't
employ
him
again.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
national
league
is
not
like
an
association
of
manufacturers
and
football
is
the
national
league.
the
league
itself
is
the
entity
comprised
of
teams
who
compete
with
other
--
each
other
upon
the
playing
field
so
that
each
of
the
teams
in
effect
are
partners.
the
plaintiff
himself
in
his
complaint
alleges
that
they
are
taking
part
in
a
common
venture.so
that
what
the
plaintiff's
complaint
is
actually
in
plain
common
sense,
an
agreement
of
partners
not
to
reengage
an
employee
who
quit
his
job.
if
--
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
the
answer
denies
the
black-list.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
the
judge
didn't
attempt
to
--
to
establish
that
--
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
--
there
was
no
black-list.
he
said
assuming
that
the
national
league
which
is
the
entity,
if
your
honor
pleases,
assuming
that
the
national
league
adopted
such
a
rule
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
it.
that
there's
nothing
in
--
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
no,
your
honor,
but
in
the
light
of
what
the
plaintiff
says.
you
see,
all
of
these
other
things
that
have
been
debated
thus
far
in
this
hearing
is
a
magnifying
process
of
a
simple,
plain,
everyday,
situation
into
something
which
is
--
which
it
is
not.
if
three
people
own
a
manufacturing
concern,
if
counsel,
the
three
of
us
own
a
manufacturing
concern
and
we
have
a
secretary
who
without
any
reason
at
all
quits
her
job,
if
i
agree
with
my
three
partners
who
own
the
plant
that
we
won't
hire
her
back
again,
certainly,
there
is
no
interstate
commerce
involved.
there
is
no
sherman
act
violation.
there
is
nothing
involved,
just
a
simple,
honest,
plainly
understood
everyday
event,
namely,
an
agreement
of
partners
who
own
a
business
not
to
reengage
somebody
who
quits
without
an
excuse.
that's
all
there
is
in
this
complaint.
and
that's
why
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
indicates
no
connection
between
competition
with
the
--
of
the
national
football
league
with
the
all-america
conference
and
that
without
allegations
connecting
it,
it
cannot
be
presumed.
accordingly,
the
court
said
since
what
is
involved
in
a
sherman
act
case
is
an
undue
or
unreasonable
restraint
upon
competition
which
is
the
public
injury
that
our
brother
was
discussing
earlier
today.
the
undue
or
unreasonable
restraint
upon
competition
is
what
--
is
the
public
injury
that's
involved.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
in
quoting
the
feddersen
case,
that
since
the
mere
adoption
of
a
--
a
group
of
people
who
own
a
business
of
a
rule
that
they
won't
take
back
their
employees
who
quit
without
excuse
since
that's
all
that's
involved,
there's
no
allegation
of
an
undue
or
unreasonable
restraint
upon
competition
and
no
sherman
act
violation.
there's
no
public
injury
in
the
words
of
the
feddersen
case.
there's
no
undue
restraint
and
accordingly
in
that
face
of
the
--
of
the
case
in
that
kind
of
a
discussion,
we
are
not
involved
with
whether
baseball
is
football
or
football
is
interstate
commerce
or
anything
else.
it's
a
simple
everyday
occurrence
of
a
disloyal
player
who
broke
his
contract.
now,
if
your
honors
take
that
case
and
for
some
reason
undoubtedly,
academically
sound
or
legally
appropriate,
use
that
case
as
a
means
or
in
--
in
a
way
which
will
result
in
a
trial
with
the
enormous
expense
upon
these
defendants
for
the
proof
of
what
goes
on
in
the
football
system,
for
all
of
the
delay,
the
harassment,
the
chaos
in
the
football
league,
the
league
utterly
may
well
utterly
be
destroyed
because
the
impact
upon
the
investments
in
this
business,
the
possible
liabilities
of
every
player
with
a
uniform
contract
to
be
involved
in
a
case
which
is
in
essence
nothing
but
the
claim
of
a
disgruntled,
embittered
player
who
alleges
nothing
in
his
--
in
his
complaint
in
any
manner
related
to
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act,
in
any
other
way
than
if
my
own
secretary
quit
her
job
and
that
my
partners
agree
with
me
not
to
take
her
back
again.
now,
to
--
to
go
off
on
boycotts,
bans,
black-listing
or
anything
else
is
to
fly
in
the
face
of
what
a
football
league
is
because
no
football
game
can
be
presented
to
the
public
unless
with
--
it
is
within
a
framework
of
a
league.
the
public
must
be
interested
in
the
contest.
the
respective
championship
and
the
--
the
football
league
isn't
a
combination
of
manufacturers
or
cement
workers
or
plasterers
or
the
football
league
is
an
entity
and
it's
that
entity,
that
single
entity
without
combination
with
anybody
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
himself
that
has
adopted
a
rule
that
says
that
he
--
he
can't
come
back
to
work
for
them
when
he
broke
his
contract.
now,
your
honors
have
for
many
years
consistently
held
that
the
generality
and
the
depth
and
--
and
of
vagueness
of
the
language
of
sections
1
of
sherman
act
is
comparable
to
constitutional
provisions
with
the
court
--
result
of
duty
upon
the
courts
to
interpret
it
and
then
interpreting
it.
the
courts
for
--
for
many
years,
has
said
that
the
mere
restraint
upon
commerce
is
not
enough.
it
must
be
an
unreasonable
one.
and
certainly,
no
person
may
obtain
the
benefits
of
litigating
in
a
federal
court
unless
he
does
what
your
honors
have
heretofore
held
he
must
do,
state
or
allege
or
claim
an
unreasonable
restraint
upon
commerce.
there
is
not
one
word
in
this
complaint
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
whereby
he
alleges
that
the
uniform
contract
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
upon
commerce.
now,
it's
true
that's
a
technical
pleading
point.
but
nevertheless,
before
a
man
may
or
before
a
man
may
--
may
state
a
case
or
have
his
case
heard,
he
should
be
required
to
include
within
the
framework
of
his
complaint,
the
essential
allegations
of
a
claim.
and
if
i
may
say
most
respectfully
to
require
the
defendants
to
bring
on
their
proof
with
the
delay
and
the
enormous
expense
involved
when
the
plaintiff
hasn't
even
done
which
your
honors
have
required
in
every
case
that
i've
read
that's
come
out
of
this
court,
namely,
that
any
restraint
upon
commerce
must
be
an
unreasonable
restraint
to
create
a
cause
of
action
or
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
the
plaintiff
hasn't
alleged
it.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
the
motion
in
the
district
court
was
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
and
second
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
the
district
court
sustained
the
motion
to
dismiss
without
opinion.
that
it
appears
in
the
record
that
at
the
foot
of
the
order
signed
by
the
district
judge,
there
is
without
discussion
one
case
cited
which
was
toolson.
but
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
with
some
care
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
the
claim
for
relief
is
not
stated,
not
only
--
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
well,
--
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
this
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
no,
sir.
we're
not
asking
for
that
most
respectfully.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
but
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
in
the
conventional
form
and
appears
in
the
record
in
a
conventional
form.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
i
think
not,
your
honor.
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
lower
court
was
upon
the
specific
ground
that
the
complaint
fails
to
--
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
well,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
well,
nobody
has
said
what
the
district
court
did.
the
record
is
bound
on
the
point,
your
honor.
but
it
is
apparent
upon
an
investigation
of
this
record.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
to
read
the
complaint,
no
lawyer
who
has
ever
defended
an
antitrust
action
would
believe
that
such
a
complaint
would
be
permitted
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
there
was
no
application
made
to
amend,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
well,
may
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
cannot
assume
that
the
plaintiff
can
say
anything
else.
he
has
never
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
do
so
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
district
court.
and
certainly
to
ask
this
court
for
leave
to
amend
would
be
somewhat
unusual.
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
but
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
bernard
i.
nordlinger
we
submit,
if
your
honor,
please,
this
is
not
a
minor
insufficiency.
that
the
real
basis
of
this
complaint
is
nothing
but
the
action
of
a
disgruntled
player
who
seeks
to
bring
into
complete
scrutiny
with
all
of
the
enormous
hazards
of
liabilities
and
enormous
expenses
and
delays
and
all
the
time
that
it
would
take
of
everybody
involved
when
he
really
hasn't
got
a
claim
at
all.
and
for
the
court
to
permit
him
to
do
that
when
he
hasn't
sought,
leave
to
state
anything
more
than
he
started
out
with
in
the
face
of
a
perfectly
reasonable,
academically
sound
decision
of
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
seem
to
us
most
respectfully
to
be
not
required
in
any
degree
or
sense
of
fairness
to
the
defendant.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
correct
on
that
face
of
the
case
(inaudible)
thank
you.
