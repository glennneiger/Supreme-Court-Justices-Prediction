chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
keith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
keith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
keith,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
mr.
elman,
if
they're
going
to
attribute
to
congress
the
intention
to
exclude
baseball,
you
would
also
have
to
add
to
that,
would
you
not,
the
baseball
as
it
was
found
to
have
been
organized
and
played
by
this
court
in
--
in
federal
baseball?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
you
would
have
that,
too
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman,
i
suppose
in
this
case,
if
this
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
--
and
the
defendants
had
established
that
football
was
like
baseball
in
all
respects
and
that
there
were
no
--
as
that
case
was
determined
in
federal
baseball
and
there
are
no
other
factors
to
distinguish
it
from
it,
you
would
take
the
position
that
we
would
either
have
to
follow
federal
baseball
or
reverse
it,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
the
fact
is
that
here,
it
was
decided
without
any
proof
as
to
whether
football
was
essentially
like
baseball.
somebody
just
said,
“well,
football
is
more
like
baseball
and
boxing,
so
we'll
decide
along
it
the
lines
of
--
of
baseball
rather
than
boxing.”
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
then
they'd
have
to
--
and
shouldn't
they
be
obliged
to
--
to
prove
that
at
a
minimum
that
their
facts
come
within
the
federal
baseball
case,
the
toolson
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leahy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leahy,
you
said
you
were
going
to
state
the
issue.
is
that
all
there
is
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
there
also
the
allegation
that
the
--
that
the
television
and
the
radio
has
become
a
major
portion
of
this
business
and
that
--
that,
too,
is
used
as
a
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
accomlish
it
in
results.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
were
no
facts
taken
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
case.
so
how
are
we
going
to
know?
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
one
of
the
things
that's
bothering
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
don't
know
whether
all
these
things
that
are
in
the
complaint
are
provable
or
--
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
page
10.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
leahy
before
we
get
to
shubert
case.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
the
function
of
the
reserve
clause
and
the
relationship
between
the
football
players
and
the
baseball
players
so
far
as
their
management
in
concerned?
now,
as
i
understand
it
from
reading
the
newspapers,
in
baseball,
any
man
who
goes
in
to
organize
baseball
is
a
free
agent.
he
can
sign
with
anybody
he
wants
and
organize
baseball
league.
it's
one
bite
that
--
that
organize
baseball.
then
after
he
gets
in
there,
he's
obliged
to
live
under
this
reserve
clause,
but
so
far
as
football
is
concerned
and
it
bears
upon
the
monopoly
situation,
a
man
gets
no
chance.
they
draft
him
the
year
before
he
gets
out
of
college
and
either
he
plays
with
the
team
he's
drafted
to
play
with
or
he
doesn't
play
at
all.
he's
boycotted
for
life
or
such
length
of
time
as
they
choose
to
keep
him
out.
now,
isn't
that
an
essential
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
man
is
already
in
baseball
by
contract.
but
here,
you're
taking
college
boys
who
had
never
even
said
they
wanted
to
be
in
--
in
professional
football
and
says
professional
football
to
them.
we
determine
that
you're
going
to
play
3000
miles
away
from
your
home.
if
you
live
in
san
francisco,
you
must
play
in
new
york.
and
if
you
don't
play
with
new
york,
you
don't
play
with
anybody
in
this
country.
now,
isn't
that
different
from
the
baseball
situation
where
they
give
a
man
an
opportunity
to
join
any
club
that
--
that
wants
him
and
any
club
he
wants
to
play
with
and
then
confining
to
this
reserve
clause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
my.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
mr.
leahy
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
say
that
football
is
reprehensible
in
that
--
in
that
respect.
all
i
say
is
that
it
is
different
and
should
not
the
court's
hear
evidence
on
the
effect
of
such
relationship
rather
than
to
say,
“well,
this
is
--
this
is
just
like
baseball
and
therefore
you
must
treat
the
same.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
might
not
the
--
the
draft
contribute
to
their
monopoly
and
the
way
they
restrain
commerce
if
they
have
a
control,
overall
the
football
players
of
the
country
to
the
extent
that
they
can
determine
while
they're
still
boys
in
college
that
they
must
play
with
any
team
they
want
or
--
or
forever
be
barred
from
football
isn't
--
isn't
that
a
factor
that
should
be
considered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
used
--
he
complains
that
the
black-list
and
the
boycott
is
operating
against
that
other
league
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
misunderstand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
--
i'm
undoubtedly
mistaken
but
i
thought
you
said
that
he
wanted
to
go
on
this
rival
clubs
and
--
and
they
--
they
boycotted
it
--
boycot
him
and
black-list
him
and
they
finally
told
him
that
--
that
because
of
that
black-list
he
could
--
they
couldn't
employ
him,
so
he
lost
his
employment.
now,
i
was
mistaken
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
might
not
that
be
evidentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
alleges
the
legal
effect
on
him
wouldn't
--
and
the
rest
would
be
evidentiary
and
that
--
that's
--
that's
my
point
without
condemning
anybody.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
jump
a
lot
of
hurdles
to
say
that
--
that
baseball
or
football
and
its
organization
is
exactly
like
baseball
and
its
organization
and
therefore
that
it
must
come
under
the
same
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reason
why
you
shouldn't
have
to
establish
that
in
the
hearing
before
the
lower
court
if
you
do
that
and
come
here
then
you
--
then
you've
got
the
question
as
to
whether
--
whether
you'll
be
in
the
same
position
as
federal
baseball
or
toolson?
but
until
you
do
establish
that
fact
in
--
in
the
trial
court
and
we
can
determine
by
findings
that
you
are
the
same
then
i
don't
see
how
you
can
raise
that
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
not
be
those,
the
relationship
of
tv
and
radio
to
football
is
different
from
the
relationship
of
--
of
the
same
instrumentalities
to
baseball
and
then
one
might
use
them
to
accomplish
a
different
purpose
than
the
other
and
that
the
use
of
them
might
have
a
different
effect
upon
commerce.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
say
it
wouldn't
be
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
there
be
a
difference.
if
there
was
a
difference
then
--
then
your
statement
that
baseball
had
radio
and
television
at
the
time
of
toolson
wouldn't
be
as
persuasive
to
me
as
if
you
--
it
had
been
otherwise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
wasn't
a
major
portion
of
your
income
--
was
from
television
and
radio.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
should
that
deprive
them
in
this
case
of
establishing
if
they
--
if
they
can
that
it
was
a
major
portion
of
your
income
instead
of
4%?
that's
another
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man
was
the
--
a
party
to
that
case,
was
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
might
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
an
automobile
concerned
here
was
a
--
have
suit
such
as
this
against
them
and
it
was
determined
that
that
particular
company
had
--
had
not
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
and
another
one
started
about
the
same
time
and
said,
“well,
for
30
years
now,
we
follow
the
same
practices
and
we
allege
in
our
defense,
in
our
answers
that
we
have
followed
the
same
practices
of
that
company.
and
therefore,
the
courts
foreclosed
from
--
from
inquiring
into
the
manner
in
which
we
do
our
business
because
of
this
other
decision.
would
that
be
--
would
that
be
appropriate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leahy.
mr.
nordlinger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
your
complaint
or
just
your
answer
admit
or
deny
the
black-list?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
is
it
established
by
the
judge
that
there
was
no
black-list?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
matter
how
they
might
have
operated
under
it?
