justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
understand
that
the
toolson
case
held
that
the
reserve
clause
was
valid
or
invalid,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
specifically
refused
pass
to
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
what
the
toolson
case
--
where
the
toolson
case
interpreted,
was
it?
toolson
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
is
holding
that
the
baseball
players
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
we
uphold
that
principle
in
toolson
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
--
i
didn't
think
the
opinion
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
didn't
think
the
opinion
indicated
that
at
all
to
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
had
written
into
the
antitrust
act
the
language
that
the
court
used
here
as
interpretation
of
the
act
that
this
is
to
be
unlawful
to
engage
in
monopoly
and
so
forth
but
it
has
no
intention
of
including
the
business
of
baseball
within
the
scope
of
this
law?
would
you
say
that
football
was
exempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well,
do
you
understand
that
the
toolson
case
went
any
further
than
to
say
the
whole
and
approve
the
federal
baseball
case
any
further
than
to
say
that
as
far
as
that
decision
determines
that
congress
has
no
intention
of
including
the
business
of
baseball
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws
as
we
follow
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
--
you
think
it
was
wrong
in
limiting
it
to
that
extent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
toolson
decision,
the
(inaudible)
decision
refused
to
rely
on
those
principles.
it
did
not
rely
on
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
specifically
limited
to
holding
that
--
that
so
far
as
that
decision
determines
if
congress
had
no
intention
of
including
the
business
of
baseball
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
we
left
it
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
done
this,
hadn't
done
anything
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
hadn't
done
anything
to
football
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
showed
the
difference.
isn't
it
that
the
court
in
the
federal
baseball
case
held
that
baseball
was
out?
now,
you
say
that
it
didn't
on
certain
principles
that
came
up
before
the
court
long
years
after
this.
federal
baseball
case
was
back.
so
it
was
--
was
written.
and
this
court
trying
to
upset
it,
its
holding
to
the
extent
that
it
held
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
baseball
playing
and
if
i
--
as
a
part
of
the
violation
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
might
be
some
members
of
the
court
that
would
bat
for
the
stare
decisis
and
bat
for
the
25
years.
it
would
have
agreed
with
federal
baseball.
that
was
left
open,
wasn't
it
in
the
toolson
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
district
court
sustain
an
objection
on
that
ground
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
--
you're
asking
in
effect
that
for
summary
judgment
on
treatment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
should
think
that
if
there's
any
objection
to
the
sufficiency
of
pleading
that's
complained
by
reason
of
failing
to
allege
some
facts
that
are
not
necessary,
proper
disposition
would
not
be
summary
judgment
but
to
give
him
a
chance
to
amend.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
but
the
result
of
what
you're
asking
would
be
a
dismissal
and
effect
of
a
summary
--
summary
dismissal
on
the
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it
sounds
like.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
what
you
say
is
the
complaint
is
not
good
by
the
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
are
some
allegations
that
are
not
made
in
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
therefore,
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time
pointed
that
out,
we
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
deny
the
plaintiffs
a
chance
to
have
their
case
determined
on
the
pleadings
as
they
are
now,
might
be
amended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
--
but
he
cited
the
toolson
case
and
that
was
a
--
i
--i
had
supposed
up
to
now
that
no
one
thought
that
it
was
done
on
any
other
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
and
discussed
the
ground
but
it
didn't
say
that
the
district
court
had
gone
to
that
ground,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
not
but
may
--
there
--
there's
quite
a
difference
between
them
that
go
to
trial
and
inform
they
are
and
in
giving
part
of
the
chance
to
amend.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
there
wasn't
but
this
--
this
argument
against
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
was
first
written
out
by
any
court
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
we
would
have
to
adopt
what
you
say,
it
would
be
that
a
--
affirm
the
judgment
which
dismisses
and
assuming
that
you
are
right
in
the
fact
that
there
might
be
some
additional
facts
alleged,
then
if
that's
true,
i
should
think
it's
proper
not
to
be
trying
cases,
would
not
be
the
--
to
dispose
of
it
in
such
a
summary
manner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
most
trial
lawyers
as
you
know
have
somewhat
of
an
objection
to
letting
cases
be
disposed
of,
summary
proceedings
simply
on
some
minor
insufficiency
in
the
allegations
on
the
complaint
of
