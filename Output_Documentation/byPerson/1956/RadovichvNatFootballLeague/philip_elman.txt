mr.
philip
elman
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
is
appearing
in
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
escorting
as
according
to
the
petitioner.
in
this
case,
as
in
the
boxing
case
that
came
before
the
court
two
terms
ago,
the
question
is
whether
the
logic
of
the
baseball
decisions
requires
the
holding
that
the
sherman
act
also
extends
the
exemption
to
other
businesses
involving
sports.
the
court
answered
that
question
in
the
negative
in
the
boxing
case
and
we
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case
is
controlling
here.
in
our
view,
there
are
no
legally
significant
differences
between
the
business
of
boxing
and
between
the
business
of
football,
legally
significant,
that
is,
in
relation
to
the
application
of
the
sherman
act,
in
relation
to
the
coverage
of
the
sherman
act
and
in
relation
to
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis.
in
the
boxing
case,
the
court
made
it
explicit
that
the
baseball
decisions
dealt
with
baseball
and
with
nothing
else.
the
court
made
it
clear
that
as
to
baseball,
there
was
a
unique
set
of
circumstances
which
existed,
which
combined
in
their
totality
to
justify
giving
baseball
a
special
status
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
very
aptly
characterized
the
unique
immunity
of
baseball
under
the
sherman
laws
--
sherman
law
as
really
in
the
nature,
a
historical
accident
arising
from
the
fact
which
is
--
which
exists
as
to
baseball
but
which
it
does
not
exist
as
to
any
other
sport,
that
there
was
a
decision
in
this
court
relating
to
baseball.
that
it
was
on
the
books
for
30
years.
that
it
was
regarded
by
baseball
as
giving
it
a
special
status
and
on
the
basis
that
--
basis
of
that
understanding,
baseball
grew
and
developed.
and
that
the
congress
had
not
seen
fit
during
that
whole
period
to
intervene.
now,
that
was
the
unique,
exceptional,
extraordinary
combination
of
circumstances
that
--
that
the
court
in
the
toolson
case
found
sufficient
to
justify
giving
baseball
a
preferred
status.
boxing
undertook
to
rely
on
the
logic
of
the
toolson
ruling
that
it
--
it
argued
that
there
could
be
no
logical
differentiation
between
one
sport
and
another.
and
that
so
far
as
the
sherman
act
was
concerned,
that
there
could
not
--
there
could
not
be
an
exemption
for
one
business
involving
a
playing
of
the
sport
in
another
business.
now,
that
contention
was
considered
by
the
court.
it
was
--
it
was
accepted
by
two
members
of
the
court
but
was
not
accepted
by
the
court.
it
was
rejected
and
we
think
that
decision
is
the
decision
which
should
have
been
dispositive
of
this
case.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
face
of
the
boxing
club
case,
the
respondents
you
read
--
read
their
briefs,
seemed
to
be
abandoning
the
ground
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case,
namely
as
mr.
keith
pointed
out,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
football
was
more
like
baseball
than
like
boxing
and
therefore
it
should
be
given
the
exemption
that
--
that
baseball
enjoys.
the
respondents
don't
make
that
argument,
at
least
not
in
those
terms.
they
say
in
their
brief
that
it's
inaccurate
and
confusing
to
speak
of
an
exemption.
they
concede
that
football
is
not
exempt
form
the
sherman
act.
they
formulate
their
argument
in
somewhat
different
terms
and
it
seems
to
us
to
reduce
itself
to
this.
they
say
that
football
and
baseball
resembled
one
another
in
that
in
both
sports,
it's
necessary
to
maintain
a
reasonable
level
of
equality
on
the
playing
field
that
certain
restraints
on
the
freedom
of
players
to
contract
have
to
be
imposed
because
otherwise
the
rich
clubs
would
sign
up
the
better
players
and
there
would
not
be
real
competition
on
the
playing
field.
and
they
say
further
that
those
restraints
of
trade
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
as
to
baseball
that
on
the
merits
those
restraints
are
--
are
not
invalid,
not
unreasonable.
and
therefore
as
the
matter
of
stare
decisis
that
it's
valid
for
the
baseball
business
to
use
such
restraints
on
its
players,
certainly
valid
for
the
football
business
to
do
the
same.
now
as
i
indicated,
that
argument
does
not
seem
to
be
presented
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
dealing
with
it
on
its
own
intrinsic
merits,
we
have
some
difficulties
with
it.
first
of
all,
it
may
very
well
be
as
mr.
keith
has
argued
in
his
reply
brief
that
football
and
baseball
are
not
identical
with
respect
to
the
facts
that
in
football
there's
this
player
draft
in
which
all
the
names
of
the
college
players
are
put
into
a
hat
and
the
--
and
the
professional
football
team
which
happens
to
pick
out
your
name
has
the
exclusive
right
to
your
services
and
if
you
don't
sign
with
them,
you
can't
sign
with
anybody.
and
there
are
other
differentiations
between
football
and
baseball
which
can
be
argued.
but
of
course
this
case
arises
on
the
pleadings
and
none
of
that
is
in
the
record
as
a
matter
of
surmise
and
speculations,
i
won't
--
we
won't
rest
our
--
we
and
we
can't
properly
rest
our
objections
to
the
argument
on
--
on
that
ground
alone.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
as
i
understand
the
respondent's
argument,
they
--
they
seem
to
be
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
restraints
are
reasonable.
now,
they
find
that
in
the
baseball
cases,
we
do
not.
we
don't
see
how
the
--
how
the
issue
of
reasonableness
assuming
it
is
in
the
case
can
be
decided
at
this
level.
their
--
there's
their
--
their
allegations
in
this
complaint
mr.
justice
of
--
of
boycotting,
of
black-listing,
of
bans,
there's
a
--
the
--
the
central
allegation
here,
the
gravamen
of
this
complaint
as
--
as
we
read
it
is
not
the
reserve
clause.
the
gravamen
of
this
complaint
was
that
these
defendants
were
conspiring
to
monopolize
football.
they
were
conspiring
to
destroy
a
rival
league,
the
all-american
conference.
that
as
a
result
of
this
conspiracy,
mr.
radovich
was
injured.
now,
the
reserve
clause
is
certainly
an
--
an
aspect
of
that
conspiracy,
but
we
--
we
don't
see
how
one
can
accept
the
contention
that
simply
because
the
complaint
alleges
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
one
of
the
means
used
in
carrying
out
that
illegal
conspiracy
or
monopoly
is
the
reserve
clause.
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
complaint
has
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
philip
elman
and
that's
the
issue
before
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
whether,
the
complaint
was
properly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
--
we
believe
that
in
this
case
as
in
the
shubert
case
and
the
boxing
case,
the
complaint
stated
the
cause
of
action.
the
case
should
have
been
permitted
to
go
to
trial,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
dismissed
the
complaint
solely
on
the
ground
that
they
did,
that
the
football
business
was
governed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
applicable
to
baseball
and
therefore
no
cause
of
action
can
be
asserted.
now,
if
--
if
the
--
the
allegations
in
this
--
allegations
to
this
complaint
would
certainly
state
the
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act,
if
--
if
it
did
involve
football,
if
it
involved
any
manufacturing
or
other
enterprise
and
interstate
commerce
which
was
alleged
had
undertaken
to
monopolize
the
entire
industry
and
for
that
purpose
had
agreed
with
others
that
anyone
who
worked
for
x
manufacturing
company
which
it
wished
--
which
it
was
conspiring
to
destroy
would
be
black-listed
for
his
life.
there'd
be
absolutely
no
question
if
that
was
a
--
a
valid
cause
of
action
under
the
--
the
sherman
act.
now,
we
think
getting
back
to
the
argument
that
the
respondents
make
is
the
stare
decisis
in
the
baseball
cases
that
their
argument
is
in
essence
that
the
federal
baseball
case
has
--
has
validated
these
restraints
as
to
the
baseball
business.
and
therefore,
stare
decisis
requires
that
they
be
validated
as
to
football.
but
the
federal
baseball
case
didn't
hold
anything
at
all
as
to
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
means
used
to
effectuate
the
conspiracy
there.
indeed
mr.
justice
holmes
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
said
that
in
the
view
that
the
court
took
to
the
case,
it
was
unnecessary
even
to
mention
the
means
that
were
used.
the
federal
baseball
case
stands
for
a
rather
simple
proposition
of
law
not
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
"restraint
of
trade
or
commerce"
in
--
in
the
sherman
act.
the
federal
baseball
decision
is
a
decision
as
to
the
scope
or
the
coverage
of
the
act.
what
it
really
--
what
it
construes
is
the
word
"commerce
among
the
states."
that's
what
the
federal
baseball
case
dealt
with.
it's
a
holding
as
to
the
scope
and
the
coverage
of
the
act
and
not
a
holding
as
to
what
is
legal
or
illegal
within
the
area
that
the
sherman
act
covers.
mr.
justice
holmes
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
said
that
as
to
baseball,
the
essential
thing
was
the
playing
of
the
game
and
that
the
only
interstate
aspects
of
baseball
as
alleged
and
--
and
proved
at
that
--
that
in
that
case,
on
that
record,
were
the
interstate
travel
of
players.
and
the
court
and
federal
baseball
said
that
that
travel
which
was
the
only
thing
relied
upon
to
show
interstate
commerce
was
merely
casual
and
was
--
was
a
mere
incident
and
that
the
playing
was
the
essential
thing.
so
that
the
federal
baseball
case
as
a
precedence
stands
for
this
proposition
of
law
that
a
business
is
not
engaged
in
trade
or
commerce
under
the
sherman
act
where
its
dominant
essential
features
are
local
and
not
commercial
in
the
ordinary
sense
even
though
it
may
have
some
interstate
features
that
are
merely
incidental
and
casual
and
trivial
in
relation
to
the
business
as
a
whole.
but
the
court
in
federal
baseball
recognized
that
in
each
case
you
have
to
make
an
ad
hoc
determination
as
to
whether
the
interstate
features
are
--
are
merely
incidental
as
they
were
found
to
be
in
federal
baseball
or
whether
they
rise
to
a
greater
magnitude
because
in
the
very
next
term,
in
the
hart-keith
vaudeville
exchange
case,
the
court
found
that
the
allegations
of
interstate
commerce
there
did
rise
to
a
greater
magnitude.
so
that
the
federal
baseball
case
as
a
decision
merely
holds
that
when
interstate
commerce
is
alleged,
you
have
to
decide
how
much
interstate
commerce
is
alleged
and
to
decide
whether
it's
enough
to
bring
into
operation
the
provisions
of
the
sherman
law.
so
that
if
in
this
case,
if
it
were
merely
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
that
the
football
that
--
that
he
was
a
football
player
and
that
football
games
were
played
and
that
as
a
part
of
that
game,
it
was
essential
for
players
to
travel
from
one
state
to
another.
and
if
the
only
interstate
allegations
in
the
complaint
were
travel
of
players
so
that
they
can
play,
we
would
say
that
as
a
precedent,
the
federal
baseball
decision
is
certainly
a
relevant
precedent,
whether
there's
been
an
--
an
alteration
in
the
climate
of
--
of
construction,
of
--
of
the
concept
of
interstate
commerce
and
so
on,
of
course,
being
another
question,
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
relevant
precedent.
but
in
this
case,
the
allegations
of
interstate
commerce
are
so
extensive
that
under
many
decisions
of
this
court
leaves
me
no
question
at
all
that
interstate
commerce
is
shown.
so
the
--
the
requirement
of
the
federal
baseball
case
is
satisfied.
there's
no
necessity
here
to
either
distinguish
or
overrule
the
federal
baseball
case.
the
toolson
case,
the
other
baseball
decision
was
not
a
decision
construing
the
sherman
act.
it
was
not
a
decision
holding
that
the
--
that
the
reserve
clause
or
anything
else
about
baseball
was
reasonable
or
necessary
or
it
was
valid.
the
toolson
case
was
not
a
decision
even
as
to
the
scope
of
the
--
of
the
act.
it
was
a
decision
as
to
stare
decisis.
it
was
--
it
almost
had
in
it
the
elements
of
res
judicata
that
there
had
--
that
since
there
had
been
a
decision
of
the
court
as
to
baseball,
baseball
had
to
be
recognized
as
being
in
a
special
category.
so
that
in
its
very
terms,
the
toolson
case
could
deal
with
baseball
and
only
with
baseball
because
no
other
sport
could
bring
itself
within
the
first
essential
requirement
of
toolson
that
there
be
a
decision
of
this
court
applicable
as
to
it.
so
that
we
--
we
believe
it's
--
it's
not
necessary
to
elaborate
the
arguments
here
because
we
think
that
they're
merely
a
--
a
repetition
of
what
was
contended
very
earnestly
and
very
fully
in
the
boxing
case
that
it's
true
that
in
--
the
boxing
was
an
individual
sport
and
football
is
a
team
sport.
but
the
fact
that
the
football
--
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
--
that
boxing
was
a
sport
of
which
only
individuals
engage
was
certainly
not
a
relevant
factor
in
--
in
the
boxing
club
case.
it
was
the
basis
on
which
the
court
decided
the
boxing
case
was
not.
it
was
something
about
the
manner
in
which
that
the
sport
was
conducted.
the
basis
of
the
boxing
club
case
was
that
an
exemption
from
the
sherman
act
is
not
to
be
given
by
the
court,
to
be
given
by
congress
and
that
the
special,
unique
status
of
baseball
could
not
be
shared
by
others
--
other
businesses
simply
because
they
happen
to
involve
an
athletic
exhibition.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
--
there's
--
there's
a
question
of
--
of
whether
one
can
say
it's
given
by
congress
or
given
by
the
court
or
whether
it
was
given
by
both.
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
legislate
with
respect
to
baseball
was
one
of
the
fact
this
--
upon
which
this
court
relied
in
reaching
in
the
conclusion
baseball
was
exempt.
so,
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
that
either
yes
or
no.
now,
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
effect
of
the
toolson
case,
that
the
practical
effect
of
the
toolson
case
and
of
the
reasoning
underlying
it
is
just
as
if
congress
had
given
--
had
written
into
the
--
the
sherman
act,
the
commerce
among
the
states
except
--
except
the
baseball
business.
i
think
that's
the
effect
of
it.
now,
that
--
that
isn't
what
congress
wrote
into
the
sherman
act
when
it
was
originally
enacted.
it's
the
product
of
the
history
of
--
of
litigation
under
the
act
and
it's
also
the
product
of
an
application
of
a
--
of
a
basic
doctrine
of
--
of
the
law
as
to
respect
for
prior
of
precedence
and
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
believe
--
i
believe
the
court
has
passed
all
that.
i
think
that
issue
has
been
--
has
been
fought
out
and
was
decided
when
--
when
the
toolson
case
came
before
the
court,
the
--
the
question
was
whether
the
court
should
in
effect
read
an
exemption
into
the
act
for
the
baseball
business.
if
the
court
overcame
that
hurdle
and
did
read
it,
then
the
next
question
that
came
--
that
came
up
was
whether
--
whether
that
necessitated
simply
by
the
--
by
reason
of
logic,
a
holding
that
other
businesses
were
to
be
treated
similarly.
now,
the
court
in
the
boxing
club
case
pointed
out
that
the
--
the
crucial
question
is
not
whether
baseball
is
like
boxing
as
far
as
the
--
as
far
as
the
conduct
of
these
boys
is
concerned.
that's
not
relevant.
the
crucial
question
is
in
whether
baseball
is
like
boxing
or
football
or
any
other
sport
if
it
were
an
original
de
novo
question
under
the
sherman
act
because
certainly
if
these
cases
all
arose
in
1890,
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
court
would
--
would
so
far
as
the
commerce
coverage
of
the
act
is
concerned
not
differentiate
them.
but
there
is
a
legally
significant
differentiation
between
baseball
and
between
football
and
boxing
and
the
other
sports.
and
that
arises
from
stare
decisis.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that's
--
that's
the
way
we
read
the
toolson
decision.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
we
read
the
toolson
case
is
limited
precisely
to
the
holding
of
the
federal
baseball
case
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
insofar,
as
et
cetera.
what
the
toolson
--
that
the
court
in
--
in
the
shubert
and
boxing
opinions
made
it
plain
that
it
was
--
that
the
court
has
--
wasn't
re-examining
any
prior
decision
on
the
merits.
it
wasn't
reaffirming.
it
wasn't
overruling
any
prior
case.
it
was
accepting
the
decisions
for
what
they
did,
for
what
--
for
the
--
for
the
practical
consequences
upon
which
men
had
the
right
to
rely
and
upon
which
that
--
that
they
acted
and
the
law,
of
course,
takes
that
into
account
and
it
was
taken
into
account
in
the
toolson
case.
now,
the
football
business
cannot
bring
itself
within
the
rationale
of
the
toolson
case.
mr.
philip
elman
let
me
put
--
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
sir.
suppose
--
suppose
you
have
a
litigation
between
a
and
b
in
which
one
of
the
issues
is
the
value
of
a's
land.
and
the
court
finds
that
in
the
prior
litigation
between
a
and
b
(inaudible)
and
the
court
says,
“we're
not
going
to
take
evidence
as
to
whether
it's
really
worth
$10
or
not.
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to
bring
out
to
establish
that
valuation
for
purposes
of
this
too.”
the
next
day,
a
suit
is
brought
between
c
and
d
and
c's
land
is
right
next
to
a
which
was
identical
with
it
in
every
respect
except
that
this
is
exactly
the
same.
its
next
--
but
it's
very
much
like
it.
and
c
says,
“well,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
my
land
and
a.
and
the
court
has
already
held
that
a's
land
is
worth
$10
an
acre,
therefore,
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
consider
what
the
value
of
the
land
actually
is.”
now,
i
think
the
proper
response
of
the
court
should
be
that
decision
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
relationship
between
a
and
b
where
it's
--
it's
for
the
benefit
of
a
and
for
the
benefit
of
a
alone.
as
far
as
you,
c,
are
concerned,
you've
got
to
show
us
how
much
your
land
is
worth.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
to
the
extent
that
that
analogy
applies
here,
is
there's
nothing
unfair
and
nothing
improper
in
giving
the
baseball
business
the
benefit
of
the
decision
which
was
applicable
to
it
and
which
was
not
applicable
in
its
terms
to
--
to
any
other
business.
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
so
far
--
so
far
as
the
toolson
case
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
hold
any
principle
applicable
in
construing
the
sherman
act.
all
that
the
toolson
case
is
--
says
it
through
power
of
federal
baseball.
so
far
as
the
federal
baseball
case
is
concerned,
the
principle
it
laid
down
is
not
a
principle
which
--
is
which
is
either
unique
and
--
and
applicable
only
to
baseball
or
indeed
applicable
to
any
other
sport.
the
federal
baseball
decision
was
not
a
decision
as
to
baseball
and
--
and
it
was
not
based
upon
any
considerations
that
were
peculiar
to
baseball.
it
was
a
decision
as
to
what
commerce
--
the
interstate
commerce
says
and
it
was
a
decision
that
where
--
where
a
suit
is
brought
under
the
sherman
act,
you've
got
to
show
restraint
on
interstate
commerce.
and
the
mere
fact
that
--
that
the
--
you
have
some
interstate
elements
in
your
case
doesn't
establish
that
you
--
your
--
your
--
that
a
--
there's
a
strength
in
an
interstate
business.
the
--
the
court
in
--
in
the
federal
baseball
case
was
barely
applying
a
more
basic,
more
fundamental
proposition
that
mr.
justice
holmes
frequently
articulated
that
interstate
commerce
is
a
practical
conception
that
--
that
in
that
field
there's
another
field
that
it's
a
matter
of
degree
that
what
may
be
--
what
may
be
incidental
in
the
case
of
federal
baseball
club
in
1922,
may
not
be
merely
incidental
in
the
case
next
year
of
hart
against
keith
vaudeville
exchange.
mr.
philip
elman
now,
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
short,
they
were
thinking
about
baseball
in
relation
to
commerce,
in
relation
to
interstate
commerce.
so
that
--
so
that
the
federal
baseball
case
has
a
decision
under
the
sherman
act.
it
doesn't
lay
down
any
broad,
mechanically
applicable
rules
of
law
as
to
what
business
is
or
is
not
covered
by.
it
doesn't
say
that
all
businesses
involving
sports
are
--
are
excluded.
what
it
says
is
that
the
interstate
features
have
to
be
more
than
incidental
that
if
you
have
only
--
if
you
have
a
business
where
the
essential
thing
is
something
that's
local
and
not
regarded
as
commercial,
then
the
mere
fact
that
there's
an
incidental
transportation
of
participants
doesn't
make
it
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
don't
--
mr.
philip
elman
there's
no
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
but,
mr.
justice,
no
one
has
ever
disputed
that
the
mere
playing
of
a
baseball
game
is
local.
in
the
shubert
and
boxing
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
the
mere
--
that
the
mere
performance
on
the
stage
is
a
local
affair
not
covered
by
the
sherman
act.
and
that
the
mere
--
a
--
a
mere
presentation
of
a
boxing
bout
is
--
is
a
local
affair
and
so,
too,
in
a
baseball
case
as
it
was
recognized
that
where
nine
players
meet
nine
other
players
on
a
--
on
a
baseball
diamond
that's
not
interstate
commerce
in
it's
--
in
and
of
itself.
but
the
question
is
how
much
do
you
have
to
add
to
it
to
bring
the
sherman
act
into
operation?
mr.
philip
elman
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
the
court
didn't
say
it
wasn't
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
construing
the
sherman
act.
what
the
court
said
was
that
since
--
since
there
was
this
decision
as
to
baseball
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
we
don't
reexamine
it.
since
there
was
this
decision
as
to
baseball,
we'll
leave
baseball
where
it
is.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
no.
in
my
--
in
my
hypothetical
illustration,
i
--
i
intended
by
--
but
i
intended
to
analogize
it
to
what
--
to
what
the
--
the
net
effect
of
the
federal
baseball
and
the
toolson
case
is
combined
is
as
to
baseball.
the
net
effect
of
it
is
that
the
court
has
not
reexamined
the
--
as
if
it
were
an
--
a
question
arising
de
novo.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
you
--
you
raised
a
question
which
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i'm
equipped
to
answer
this
question
of
classifying
softball
as
baseball
and
i
frankly
don't
know
it.
i
--
i
just
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
question.
mr.
philip
elman
it
doesn't
make
a
--
mr.
philip
elman
no
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
let
me
make
myself
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
clear
on
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
isn't
a
question
mr.
justice,
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
size
of
the
ball
and
how
the
game
is
played.
it's
a
question
of
whether
that
business
is
--
is
a
baseball
business.
mr.
philip
elman
that
they've
got
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
--
if
the
softball
--
if
the
softball
business
is
in
fact
the
baseball
business,
i
--
i
suspect
that
it
is
not.
i
don't
see
how
they
could
qualify
for
an
exemption
under
the
baseball
cases.
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
question
of
construing
the
toolson
case
is
--
is
to
what's
meant
by
business
of
baseball,
but
whatever
difficulties
there
may
be
as
to
softball,
it
certainly
is
no
difficulties
to
football,
it's
not
baseball.
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
allegation
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
should
--
i
should
think
that
as
a
minimum,
they
would
have
to
show
that
the
allegations
as
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
philip
elman
in
this
case,
we're
no
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
we're
no
broader
than
the
allegation
to
the
interstate
commerce
and
federal
baseball,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
that
the
mere
--
why
not
just
look
at
the
complaint
to
see
if
they're
not
the
same.
mr.
philip
elman
but
the
toolson
case
did
not
establish
that
those
allegations
were
insufficient
or
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
courts
--
mr.
philip
elman
because
it's
--
mr.
philip
elman
because
it's
baseball.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
the
important
thing
because
it's
baseball.
mr.
philip
elman
baseball
--
baseball
is
different
from
football
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
toolson
case
is
not
a
decision
as
to
what
interstate
--
as
to
what
commerce
among
the
states
is
for
the
purposes
of
the
sherman
act.
the
toolson
case
doesn't
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations,
the
restraint
of
commerce
in
--
in
that
case
at
all.
mr.
philip
elman
precisely
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
now,
if
one
accepts
the
toolson
case
and
accepts
the
--
the
--
that
the
basis
on
which
it's
decided
as
we
must
the
toolson
case
has
no
authority
that
--
that
can
give
any
comfort
to
any
business
other
than
baseball.
mr.
philip
elman
if
i
may
spend
one
minute
on
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
on
the
other
point
in
the
case.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
did
draw
that
inference
here.
if
the
--
there's
another
point
in
this
case
which
goes
beyond
football,
baseball
and
sports
in
which
it
is
of
importance
as
to
the
government.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
has
tried
it
--
treble
damage
action
declares
that
in
addition
to
showing
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
in
addition
to
showing
injury
to
himself,
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
alleging
and
proving
a
further
element,
namely,
that
there's
been
a
--
an
injury
to
the
public.
now,
this
--
there's
no
basis
at
all
for
imposing
upon
plaintiff's
treble
damages
who
already
have
a
heavy
burden.
this
additional
burden,
the
--
the
statute
--
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
make
any
such
requirement
that
as
to
the
government
in
its
antitrust
litigation
that
it'd
show
some
vague
public
interest,
public
injury
showing.
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
there
--
there's
any
justification
for
making
more
difficult
than
it
already
is.
they
asked
if
those
who
were
injured
by
a
violation
to
the
antitrust
laws,
before
it's
recognized
the
importance
of
maintaining
that
as
an
effective
supplemental
remedy
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws.
and
we
--
and
we
urge
the
court
to
make
it
clear
that
the
--
that
there
is
no
such
requirement
by
the
litigation.
thank
you,
sir.
