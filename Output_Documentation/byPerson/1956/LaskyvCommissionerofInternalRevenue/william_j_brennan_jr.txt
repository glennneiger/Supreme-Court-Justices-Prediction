well,
if
--
mr.
ash,
does
your
argument
really
come
down
to
this,
that
even
though
the
internal
revenue
code
uses
language
of
finality
as
regards
actions
to
the
tax
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
trying
to
persuade
us
that
this
is
so
much
a
court
that
it
has
powers
notwithstanding
that
congressional
language
to
do
the
thing
that
you
wanted
them
to
do
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
the
only
significance
of
your
argument
that
this
is
a
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
suggest
that
the
federal
civil
rules
obtained
in
the
procedures
before
the
tax
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
the
congress
said
that
in
the
case
of
the
tax
court,
certain
things
shall
be
final.
it
didn't
add
an
exemption
or
qualification
like
rule

(b),
did
it?

mr.
elman,
is

the
only
provision
for
service
of
their
copy
of
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
merely
says
that
it
shall
be
noticed.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
shall
be
--
that
--
that
it
shall
be
supplied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
done
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
there
was
some
evidence
that
experienced
practitioners
in
this
field
go
find
out
for
themselves?
justice
william
