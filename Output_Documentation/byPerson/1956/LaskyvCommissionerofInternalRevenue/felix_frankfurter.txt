justice

well,
that
--
i'm
always
troubled
when
i
have
to
decide
and
ask
that
question
like
that.
what
does
that
mean
that
it's
a
court?
it
certainly
must
be
a
--
the
certain
purposes
of
this
court,
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
you
can
review
its
decision,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
i
answer
yes
or
no
to
that
question,
mr.
ash?
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
--
do
i
decide
this
thing
without
any
statutory
materials
or
without
anything?
just
whether
--
whether
a
tax
court
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
can
set
aside
something
that
it
thinks
it's
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
abstract
to
that,
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
in
a
vital
way,
it
isn't
really
a
court
in
the
sense
of
article
iii.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
that
--
where
do
we
look
from
there?
well,
it's
really
--
a
really
not
--
really
yes,
really
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
tax
court
term?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
tax
court
unlike
other
federal
courts,
did
it
have
terms
and
that
they
have
been
abolished
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
the
limitations
derived
from
statutory
restrictions
if
they
do
unless
it's
all
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
go
to
the
whole
structure
of
the
tax
law
at
the
time
for
review
and
manner
of
review,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
if
you
just
go
by
the
legislation
here,
you
have
tranced
in,
but
you
say
that
there's
an
inherent
power
in
any
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
relieve
for
injustice.
this
is
a
court
u.a.d.,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
it
has
power
to
declare
it
unconstitutional,
what's
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
we
found
it
unconstitutional
provision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
so
did
they,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
more
astute
new
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
more
astute
new
counsel?
