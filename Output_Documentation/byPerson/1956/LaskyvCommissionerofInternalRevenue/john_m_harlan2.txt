what
are
the
circuits
as
to
which
there
is
a
square
conflict
on
this
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
even
if
it's
a
court,
aren't
you
up
against
the
same
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
at
the
april
conference,
mr.
lasky
and
his
lawyers,
they
knew
that
they
had
lost
the
case,
that
they
didn't
have
the
pro
forma
entry
of
the
order,
entered
on
the
opinion,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
have
the
opinion
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
contend
that
that
was
done
by
the
tax
court
for
the
purpose
of
giving
a
right
of
appeal?
