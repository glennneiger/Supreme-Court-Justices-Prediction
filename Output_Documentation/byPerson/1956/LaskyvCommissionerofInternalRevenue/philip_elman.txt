mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
facts,
i
should
like
to
clarify
one
point
that
may
perhaps
not
be
clear.
as
mr.
ash
pointed
out,
this
case
was
decided
by
the
tax
court
in
favor
of
the
commissioner
against
the
taxpayers.
the
tax
court
on
april
8,
1954
entered
an
opinion,
findings
of
fact
and
a
formal
decision
to
that
effect.
the
clerk
of
the
tax
court
sent
copies
of
all
three
of
those
documents
by
registered
mail
to
counsel
for
the
taxpayers.
in
case
of
the
opinion,
the
findings
of
the
fact
that
was
mailed,
they
were
mailed
out
on
april
8th
in
a
case
of
the
formal
decision
that
was
mailed
out
the
following
day,
on
the
9th.
the
--
the
taxpayer's
lawyers
in
los
angeles
received
copies
of
the
opinion,
findings
of
fact
deciding
the
case
against
them.
on
april
14th,
they
held
a
conference
attended
by
mr.
lasky
and
by
all
of
taxpayer's
lawyers
at
which
they
considered
what
their
next
step
should
be,
whether
they
should
take
an
appeal,
whether
they
should
attempt
to
compromise
the
case.
at
that
conference,
mr.
lasky
was
informed
by
his
lawyers
that
he
--
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
three
months
from
the
date
of
the
entry
of
the
formal
decision
within
which
the
petition
for
review
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
that
he
would
be
kept
informed.
the
case
arises
because
it
appears
that
the
formal
decision
which
was
pro
forma
entry
merely
restating
the
tax
court's
decision.
the
copy
of
the
tax
court's
formal
decision,
although
was
sent
by
the
clerk
of
the
tax
court,
although
was
sent
by
registered
mail,
and
although
counsel
for
taxpayers
knew
that
it
was
forthcoming
that
it
was
the
established
practice
of
the
tax
court
to
enter
such
decisions
almost
immediately
thereafter.
it's
a
matter
--
a
few
minutes
to
prepare
such
an
order.
the
court
will
find
it
in
the
record
pages
92
and
93.
although
that
was
the
situation,
the
copy
of
that
decision
apparently
was
misplaced
in
the
files
of
the
law
firm
representing
mr.
lasky.
and
no
inquiry
was
made
of
the
clerk
of
the
tax
court
as
to
what
happened
in
the
case
until
july
20th,
1954
which
was
three
months
and
12
days
after
the
opinion
and
findings
of
facts
were
entered
and
three
months
and
12
days
after
the
decision
was
entered
and
12
days
after
the
three
months
period
for
appeal
had
expired.
so
that
the
first
--
first
inquiry
addressed
to
the
tax
court
as
to
the
--
as
in
this
case
from
counsel
for
the
taxpayers
came
after,
the
--
the
period
for
petitioning
for
review
has
expired
and
after
under
the
clear
expressed
terms
of
section
1140
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
1939,
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
on
page
52.
after
it
had
become
final
and
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
under
the
statute,
the
decision
of
the
tax
court,
whether
it
be
considered
article
iii
court
or
a
non-article
iii
court
or
some
other
kind
of
court
is
immaterial
because
even
if
they
were
even
if
this
is
considered
an
article
iii
court
which
of
course
it
isn't.
but
even
if
it
were
an
article
iii
court,
congress
of
course
could
make
provision
as
it
has
in
the
--
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
the
district
court.
congress
can
make
provision
as
to
when
a
decision
becomes
final
and
beyond
the
point
of
--
of
reconsideration.
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
according
to
the
affidavits
of
the
taxpayer's
counsel,
they
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
there
was
in
their
office,
the
files
of
their
office
at
that
time,
a
copy
of
the
tax
court's
formal
decision.
they
knew
--
they
have
the
opinion.
mr.
philip
elman
they
have
the
opinion,
which
concludes
on
page
92
of
the
record.
the
respondent
said
to
the
commissioner,
“the
respondent's
determination
is
sustained.
decisions
will
be
entered
for
the
respondent.”
that
was
served
on
him
the
date
that
it
was
entered,
april
8.
they
received
it
sometime
between
april
8th
and
april
14th
when
this
conference
was
held,
so
they
knew
they
lost
the
case.
and
they
also
knew
that
under
the
statute,
under
section
1142
on
page
54
that
there
was
--
there
was
a
period
provided
for
review
of
three
months.
the
time
for
review
runs
from
the
date
the
decision
is
rendered,
not
from
the
date
it's
received
by
counsel.
section
1117
(c),
on
page
51,
is
--
is
perfectly
specific
on
that.
that
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
shall
be
held
to
be
rendered
upon
the
date
that
an
order
specifying
the
amount
of
the
deficiency
is
entered
in
the
records
of
the
tax
court
now,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
need
for
any
computation,
where
--
where
they
--
whether
there's
a
need
for
computation,
that
sometimes
takes
a
little
longer.
here,
the
commissioner's
determination
was
sustained.
all
that
was
needed
was
a
--
a
dictation
of
a
short
order
of
decision.
judge
harron
in
the
record
in
this
case
states
what
the
practice
of
a
tax
court
is
in
its
respect.
she
stated
that
she
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
failure
of
any
--
the
counsel
for
taxpayers
to
raise
any
question
about
this
until
after
the
three-month
period
had
expired.
and
--
and
mr.
ash
frankly
and
candidly
stated
he
too
could
not
understand
what
the
explanation
for
that
was,
that
this
was
a
case
were
papers
have
been
lost
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
it's
the
only
provision
in
the
--
in
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir,
and
there's
no
--
there's
--
there's
no
provision
in
the
statute
or
in
tax
court's
rules
which
is
comparable
to
the
provision
of
rules
of
civil
procedure,
making
it
a
duty
of
the
--
of
the
clerk
to
send
a
copy
of
the
judgment
to
the
party.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
that
it
is
done
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
was
done
here.
and
there
was
no
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
losing
party
discovers
for
the
first
time
after
the
period
for
appeal
has
ran
that
he
has
lost
the
case.
in
this
case,
they
knew
almost
immediately
after
the
tax
court's
opinion
and
decision
were
entered,
but
--
but
the
cause
was
lost.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
that
was
all
fully
developed
in
the
record
in
this
case
at
the
hearing
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
--
and
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
practice
familiar
to
all
lawyers
who
have
anything
to
do
with
the
tax
court
that
the
decisions
in
such
a
case
are
entered
almost
simultaneously,
usually
the
very
same
day.
and
mr.
ash
stated
that
he
had
been
handling
the
case.
he
would
have
been
down
there
a
few
days
to
find
out
why
he
had
received
the
copy
of
the
decision.
now,
we
think
that
section
1140
in
the
context
of
the
--
of
all
the
provisions
of
the
code
dealing
with
procedures,
administration,
collection
of
taxes
that
that
provision
provides
a
cutoff
day,
as
the
tax
court
decisions
beyond
which
the
power
of
--
of
the
court,
the
tax
court
or
of
the
court
of
review
expires.
that
once
--
once
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
has
become
final
as
defined
in
the
statute,
it
--
it's
no
longer
subject
to
reconsideration,
except
possibly
where
there
is
an
exceptional
or
extraordinary
circumstances
like
fraud
under
no
such
circumstances
he
alleged
have
found
here.
now,
that
statute
was
considered
by
this
court
in
two
cases,
the
northern
coal
company
case
in
1934
and
the
simpson
case
in
1944
in
321
u.s.
and
the
court's
decisions
in
those
cases
except
the
construction
that
we
placed
upon
the
statute
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
placed
upon
the
statute,
namely,
that
when
one
of
the
events
specified
by
the
statute
has
occurred
to
make
a
decision
final,
it
no
longer
becomes
--
no
longer
is
subject
to
the
process
of
correction
or
reexamination
that
might
otherwise
exist.
in
the
northern
coal
company
case,
the
court
--
this
court
had
affirmed
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
sustaining
a
board
of
tax
appeal
decision
against
the
commissioner.
it
had
affirmed
it
by
an
equally
divided
court.
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
this
court.
it
was
denied
a
mandate
issue.
under
section
1140
(b)
(3),
that
tax
--
that
board
of
tax
appeal
decision
was
final.
then
thereafter,
but
during
the
very
same
term
of
court,
this
court
decided
another
case
involving
the
same
issue
in
favor
of
the
government.
and
the
government
thereupon
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
the
prior
affirmance
by
an
equally
divided
court
should
not
stand.
now,
it
has
become
clear
that
the
lower
court
decision
was
erroneous
and
so
on.
and
this
court
denied
rehearing
and
entered
a
per
curiam
order
of
opinion
stating
that
in
view
of
the
authoritative
and
explicit
requirement
of
the
statute,
rehearing
could
not
be
had.
now,
the
same
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
helvering
against
northern
coal
company
in
293
u.s.191
now,
to
the
same
effect,
construing
the
same
provision
is
the
case
of
r.simpson
and
co.against.
commissioner,
321
u.s.225
decided
in
1944.
there,
a
petition
--
there,
the
taxpayer
had
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari,
which
was
denied.
and
thereafter,
in
the
same
term
of
court,
a
conflict
of
decision
developed.
the
court
--
the
taxpayer
then
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
out
of
time.
that
motion
was
granted.
the
order
denying
certiorari
was
vacated
and
certiorari
was
granted.
however,
the
court
in
its
order
granting
rehearing
of
certiorari
requested
counsel
to
--
to
discuss
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction
to
grant
rehearing
in
view
of
section
1140
of
the
statute
and
in
view
of
the
case
of
helvering
against
northern
coal
company.
in
that,
the
case
was
argued.
the
court
entered
a
decision,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson
holding
that
since
the
denial
of
certiorari
had
become
final
by
reason
of
the
expiration
of
a
25-day
period
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing.
even
though
it
was
in
the
same
term
of
court
and
even
though
this
court
has
on
occasion
granted
untimely
petitions
for
rehearing
where
because
of
subsequent
development
of
a
conflict
subsequently
or
some
other
reason
indicating
the
need
for
further
review.
notwithstanding
that,
in
cases
originating
in
the
tax
court,
once
there
was
a
denial
of
certiorari,
the
decision
was
final.
and
--
and
it
was
held
in
the
simpson
case
that
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
rehearing.
now,
the
court
--
that
--
those
two
cases
clearly
drew
a
distinction
between
cases
coming
here
from
the
tax
court
and
cases
coming
here
from
other
courts
and
that
the
reason
for
the
distinction
is
the
statute.
congress
by
putting
these
finality
provisions
in
the
internal
revenue
code
with
respect
to
the
tax
court
decisions
has
treated
those
cases
differently
from
other
cases
and
that
--
and
that
--
that
provision
for
finality
has
to
be
respected,
whether
you
call
it
tax
court,
a
court
or
an
agency.it
isn't
quite
immaterial.
now,
there's
an
argument
that
there
is
--
there
are
inherent
powers
of
--
of
court
to
set
aside
decisions
where
good
cause
exists
and
that
inherent
power
still
resides
in
the
tax
court
notwithstanding
the
statute.
we
don't
see
how
that
argument
can
be
made
in
the
face
of
the
decision
to
the
simpson
and
the
northern
coal
company
case
--
cases.
but
in
all
events,
even
if
--
even
if
there
were
no
statute,
even
if
this
--
this
case
had
come
from
a
district
court,
certainly,
there
is
no
absolute
discretion
that
exists
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
a
judgment
which
has
become
final
by
reason
of
the
expiration
time
for
review
for
any
reason
whatsoever
at
any
time
that
there
isn't
such
a
completely
open-ended
judgment
even
in
a
district
court.
now,
this
--
the
--
the
so-called
inherent
power
of
the
court
is
accompanied
by
a
limitation,
which
has
been
established
for
many
years,
which
was
reaffirmed
in
the
very
case
upon
which
mr.
ash
relies,
the
wayne
gas
company
case
in
300
u.s.
because
in
that
case,
the
court
held
and
it
was
merely
restating
what
had
previously
have
been
held
many
times.
that
rehearing
could
not
be
granted
for
the
purpose
of
extending
the
time
for
appeal,
so
that
if
there
was
something
in
the
way
of
fraud
or
--
or
some
fundamental
character
of
error
initiating
the
judgment
itself,
that
was
one
situation.
but
where
the
only
reason
for
granting
the
rehearing
was
to
enter
a
fresh
judgment
to
start
the
time
for
appeal,
running
all
over
again
after
it
had
expired
that
it
--
that
in
any
case
where
that
was
done,
the
appeal
has
to
be
dismissed.
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
we
think
directly
found
that
that's
exactly
what
happened.
through
this
unfortunate
error,
the
--
the
time
for
appeal
had
run.
the
judgment
of
the
tax
court
have
become
final
and
the
tax
court,
that
of
feelings
of
sympathy
perhaps
entered
a
fresh
judgment
which
had
the
effect
of
--
always
--
always
hope
would
have
the
effect
of
starting
the
time
for
appeal
running
all
over
again.
now,
on
--
on
the
question
of
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i
think
that
that's
the
only
inference
really
that
one
can
draw
from
the
record.
if
--
if
your
honor
will
read
through
the
proceedings
following
the
motion
to
vacate,
you
will
--
you
will
find
no
suggestion
at
all
that
there
was
any
newly
discovered
evidence
that
previously
could
not
have
been
presented
or
that
there
was
fraud
or
that
there
was
a
--
that
there
was
anything
new
in
the
situation.
the
only
thing
that
was
new
occurred
after
the
judgment
and
that
namely,
that
the
lawyers
had
not
filed
a
petition
for
review
within
the
three
months
required
by
statute.
that
was
the
only
new
factor
in
this
situation
and
we
--
we
think
that
the
decision
in
the
wayne
company
case
shows
that
the
--
that
the
district
court
had
--
had
undertaken
to
grant
rehearing
for
that
reason.
it
would
not
start
the
period
for
--
to
appeal
running
all
over
again.
but
in
any
event,
our
basic
proposition
is
that
here,
we
have
a
statute
which
makes
it
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
consider
any
questions
of
--
of
the
inherent
power
to
reopen.
congress
has
--
has
dealt
with
the
--
with
this
question
of
finality
and
my
new
meticulous
detail,
if
your
honors
will
examine
section
1140,
you
will
find
that
it
covers
every
conceivable
contingency
that
it
can
develop
in
the
litigation
of
a
tax
court
case.
if
a
petition
for
review
isn't
filed,
that
the
petition
for
review
is
filed,
if
the
court
of
appeals
reverses
or
it
modifies
or
affirms,
if
certiorari
is
denied,
every
possible
disposition
of
the
case
on
appeal
is
dealt
with
and
every
--
as
well
as
the
disposition
of
the
case,
there's
no
appeal
was
taken.
now,
the
reason
why
congress
did
that
was
set
out
in
the
senate
committee
report
which
the
court
relied
on
and
the
simpson
case
in
which
we
quote
on
page
24
of
--
of
our
brief
that
reported
by
--
you
may
read
it.
it's
quite
short,
refers
to
section
1005
of
the
revenue
act
of
1926
which
is
section
1140
decision
i'll
quote,
it
says,
"in
as
much
as
the
statute
of
limitations
upon
assessments
and
suits
for
collection,
both
of
which
are
suspended
during
review
of
the
commissioner's
determination,
commences
it
to
run
upon
the
day
upon
which
the
board's
decision
becomes
final.
it
is
of
utmost
importance
that
this
time
be
specified
as
accurately
as
possible.
in
some
instances,
in
order
to
achieve
this
result,
the
usual
rules
of
law
applicable
in
court
procedure
must
be
changed.
for
example,
the
power
of
the
court
of
review
to
recall
its
mandate
is
made
to
expire
30
days
from
the
date
of
the
issuance
of
the
mandate.”
now,
that
latter
situation
was
the
one
with
your
honors
had
in
the
northern
coal
company
case.
the
mandate
of
the
court
had
issued
30
days
or
after
it
expired
under
the
statute,
even
though
that
this
court's
affirmance
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
court
was
powerless
to
change
it.
and
--
and
we
--
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
a
particular
taxpayer
may
--
may
have
some
justifiable
feelings
of
--
in
this
case,
a
hardship
was
done.
nevertheless,
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
a
statute
of
limitations
case.
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
filed
in
this
court
on
the
91st
day.
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
it,
no
matter
how
meritorious
it
is,
that
as
to
tax
cases,
congress
has
--
has
provided
a
system
of
collections
in
which
the
statute
of
limitation
is
important.
it's
provided
for
suspension
of
that
statute
during
tax
court
proceedings.
the
statute
begins
to
run
from
--
again,
from
the
day
the
tax
court
decision
becomes
final.
and
that
if
--
if
that
--
if
the
statute
were
to
be
disregarded
in
a
particular
case
because
it
might
be
considered
that
the
result
is
a
hard
one,
i
would
--
i
would
point
out
that
the
principle
of
finality
does
not
merely
benefit
the
government.
its
administration
of
--
of
the
tax
law
and
a
disposition
of
thousands
of
tax
claims
involving
billions
of
dollars.
it's
not
merely
of
a
concern
to
the
government.
it's
a
--
it's
concern
to
taxpayers
generally
that
if
--
if
the
government
were
free
to
reopen
the
tax
court
decision
or
to
ask
that
it
be
reopened
after
it
became
final
because
papers
were
lost
or
because
new
--
new
evidence
could
be
presented
to
show
respect
--
mr.
philip
elman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
philip
elman
a
more
astute
counsel
or
for
any
other
reason
of
that
sort.
i
--
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
taxpayers
cries
would
be
long
and
loud
and
with
good
reason.
