mr.
robert
ash
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
quite
a
change
of
pace
from
the
preceding
case.
we
have
a
simple
one-issue
case
with
the
facts
undisputed
and
there
is
no
question
of
constitutionality
involved.
our
question
is
this.
does
the
tax
court
have
the
discretionary
power
inherent
in
trial
courts
to
vacate
its
decisions
out
of
time
in
order
to
accomplish
justice
or
does
the
statute,
which
says
that
a
tax
court
decision
becomes
final
if
appeal
is
not
taken
within
three
months
deprive
it
of
such
power?
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
and
this
court
has
never
before
passed
upon
the
question.
the
facts
are
very
interesting
and
unusual.
lasky
owned
a
contractual
right
to
participate
in
the
profits
from
the
motion
picture,
the
story
of
“sergeant
york”.
in
addition,
he
was
employed
by
warner
brothers
to
--
as
a
producer
of
motion
pictures.
he
got
into
a
dispute
with
warner
brothers
as
to
the
amounts
that
were
due
under
his
participation
contract.
in
order
to
avoid
litigation,
which
would
have
jeopardized
his
employment,
he
sold
his
rights
under
the
participation
contract
to
united
artists
for
$805,000.
the
gain
on
this
sale
was
reported
as
a
long-term
capital
gain
in
the
separate
returns
filed
by
lasky
and
his
wife.
upon
audit,
the
petitioners
--
upon
audit,
the
petitioners'
tax
returns
from
1943,
the
commissioner
determined
that
the
--
each
taxpayer
owed
deficiencies
in
tax
in
excess
of
$224,000.
lasky
employed
an
outstanding
law
firm
in
los
angeles
to
contest
the
deficiency.
appeal
was
taken
to
the
tax
court
and
the
court
was
--
and
the
case
was
tried
in
december
of
1951.
however,
the
law
firm,
which
lasky
employed,
did
not
actually
try
the
case
but
associated
another
law
firm
which
did
try
the
case.
the
case
obviously
was
a
close
and
difficult
one
because
the
tax
court
judge
took
approximately
two
years
and
four
months
to
promulgate
the
findings
of
fact
and
opinion.
now,
they
were
promulgated
on
april
the
8th,
1954.
on
the
same
date,
the
tax
court
entered
its
decisions
based
on
the
findings
of
fact
and
opinion
and
mailed
copies
to
the
first
counsel
of
record.
the
decisions
in
some
way
were
filed
in
the
correspondence
file
of
the
case
and
not
in
the
legal
or
pleading
file
and
did
not
come
to
the
attention
of
counsel.
now,
it's
important
to
know
that
under
the
practice
of
the
tax
court,
they
first
issue
findings
of
facts
and
opinions.
thereafter,
they
enter
a
decision
in
accordance
with
the
findings
of
fact
and
opinion,
which
fixes
the
tax
liability
in
dollars
and
that
this
is
a
separate
and
distinct
document.
an
appeal
was
--
is
taken
from
this
decision
in
dollars
and
then
the
limitations
runs
from
the
date
of
the
decision,
and
i
say
that
it
was
the
file
--
that
these
decisions
got
into
the
file
without
counsel
knowing
about
it.
upon
receipt
of
the
findings
of
fact
and
the
opinion
by
lasky's
counsel,
the
conference
was
held
in
the
office
of
counsel.
questions
of
appeal
and
other
items
were
discussed.
lasky
was
advised
that
he
had
three
months
from
the
date
of
the
decisions
within
which
to
appeal
and
that
the
decisions
had
not
been
received.
the
matter
of
course
was
a
great
concern
to
lasky.
so,
from
time
to
time,
he
inquired
counsel
about
the
status
of
his
case.
he
was
informed
each
time
that
the
decisions
had
not
been
received,
that
he
had
nothing
to
worry
about
and
that
as
soon
as
the
decisions
were
received,
there
be
a
further
conference
to
decide
what
actions
should
be
taken.
on
the
early
part
of
august
1954,
which
was
more
than
three
months
from
the
--
from
--
from
april
8,
congress
for
lasky
telephoned
--
counsel
for
lasky
telephoned
him
and
told
him
that
going
through
the
file
on
the
case,
he
discovered
the
decisions
that
were
dated
april
the
8th,
1954.
that
they
were
on
letter
size
paper
then
placed
in
the
lasky
file
on
the
correspondence
side
instead
of
on
the
legal
or
pleading
side
that
he
had
overlooked
them,
and
he
expressed
regret
at
the
situation.
it
was
then
that
i
got
into
the
case.
i
felt
that
immediate
action
was
necessary
and
know
i
knew
little
of
the
facts.
immediately,
on
august
24,
1954,
i
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
motion
to
vacate
the
decision
out
of
time,
and
the
motion
to
vacate
the
decisions.
in
my
motion,
i
stated
that
i
filed
a
statement
of
facts
for
the
later
date.
after
i
learned
the
facts,
i
filed
a
statement
of
the
facts
on
october
18,
1954
and
amended
my
motion
asking
for
rehearing
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
well,
this
--
the
government's
brief
says
that
our
motion
for
rehearing
was
an
afterthought
because
that
made
until
several
months
after
the
original
findings
of
fact
decision.
now,
the
truth
is
that
as
soon
as
i
am
running
the
facts,
it
was
evident
to
me
that
lasky
had
a
meritorious
case
and
the
justice
demanded
a
new
trial.
on
december
the
13th,
1954,
judge
harron
of
the
tax
court
granted
our
motion
and
set
the
case
for
further
hearing
in
january
of
1955.
the
case
was
reheard
in
january.
four
witnesses
were
heard.
three
of
these
witnesses
have
not
been
witnesses
in
the
original
trial.
two
were
officers
of
the
united
artists
corporation,
which
had
made
the
purchase.
one
was
an
accountant
who
specializes
in
motion
picture
affairs
and
mr.
lasky
was
recalled.
we
felt
that
we've
made
out
a
case
on
rehearing
before
judge
harron.
however,
she
--
although
she
made
additional
findings,
she
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
she
had
reached
at
the
first
trial.
we
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
tax
court
was
not
a
court
at
all
but
was
merely
an
administrative
agency
which
had
assumed
the
powers
of
a
district
court.
we
take
the
position
that
although
a
tax
court
for
purposes
of
housing
keeping
is
designated
as
an
independent
agency
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
it
is
in
fact
a
court.
the
government
in
its
brief,
at
page
16,
admits
that
this
is
true.
as
a
court,
we
say
that
it
has
the
inherent
power
of
any
trial
court
within
its
discretion
to
vacate
decisions
out
of
time.
now,
the
--
we
have
authority
for
this
position
in
the
reo
motor
case
which
is
on
all
fours
practically
with
our
case.
that
case
went
all
the
way
to
this
court.
after
the
decision
became
final,
the
taxpayer
asked
leave
of
the
tax
court
to
file
a
motion
to
vacate
the
decision.
the
reason
was,
the
stipulation
--
stipulation
of
facts
upon
which
the
tax
court
originally
decided
the
case
contained
a
mistake
of
fact
which
resulted
in
an
omission
from
invested
capital
of
over
$2
million.
the
tax
court
denied
the
motion
but
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
the
reasoning
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
set
forth
at
page
17
of
our
original
brief.
another
supporting
case
is
a
fifth
circuit
decision,
the
buttgenbach
case
which
was
decided
way
back
in
1933.
mr.
robert
ash
the
--
the
square
conflict
was
with
the
sixth
and
with
the
fifth.
now,
the
--
also,
you
might
say
that
there's
a
conflict
with
the
third
circuit
in
the
stern
case,
which
we
discussed
at
page
19
of
our
brief
which
gives
an
excellent
explanation
of
why
the
tax
court
is
a
court
under
the
modern
decisions.
mr.
robert
ash
yes.
mr.
robert
ash
well,
i
think
this.
i
think
that
this
court
can
either
hold
that
--
that
the
tax
court
is
a
--
is
a
court
that
has
the
inherent
powers
of
a
court
and
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
he
repeatedly
approved
the
execution
--
the
assumption
and
--
of
court
powers
by
the
tax
court.
or
you
can
--
you
can
also
go
the
other
way
if
--
if
you
wish
and
say
--
and
say
that
was
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
ash
you're
doing
it
all
--
mr.
robert
ash
you're
--
you're
doing
it
all
--
mr.
robert
ash
no,
it
isn't
that
abstract.
i
think
there's
ample
authority
for
the
position
i'm
taking.
and
for
instance,
this
court
has
consistently
accepted
the
tax
court
as
a
court
in
situations
where
it
declared
acts
of
congress
unconstitutional.
certainly,
it
had
to
be
a
court
to
do
that
where
it's
declared
treasury
regulations
invalid.
you've
accepted
the
---
the
tax
court
as
a
court
where
they've
applied
rules
of
estoppel,
of
res
judicata,
estoppel
by
judgment
of
course,
and
so
forth.
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
would
say
or
base
your
decisions
on
the
fact
that
this
tax
court
is
not
really
a
court,
you
could
cause
all
kinds
of
confusion
in
the
administration
of
the
taxing
laws
if
--
if
--
mr.
robert
ash
well,
that
is
true.
it
is
--
mr.
robert
ash
well,
i
--
i
say,
you
--
you've
accepted
it
as
such,
whether
--
and
--
and
the
courts
have
consistently
accepted
it
as
such.
over
the
years,
let's
say
--
let's
say
it's
been
a
growing
thing
of
course
in
it,
in
a
considerable
length
in
my
brief,
i
explained
the
history,
the
legislative
and
judicial
history
of
the
court.
congress
thinks
the
--
they
have
created
a
court.
they
repeated
--
they
have
consistently
so
stated,
the
committee
report
so
state
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
of
what
they
believe
that
they
have
created
a
court.
mr.
robert
ash
that's
right.
mr.
robert
ash
that's
right
and
as
i
say,
there's
ample
authority
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
robert
ash
that
--
that's
the
significance
of
my
argument.
that
if
it's
a
court,
it
has
that
power.
mr.
robert
ash
well,
you
--
you
keep
passing
on
cases
up
here
where
they
used
the
--
the
word.
i
have
in
mind
your
draft
cases
where
the
statute
says
that
the
decision
of
a
draft
board
as
to
the
classification
of
a
draftee
is
final,
but
you
have
no
difficulty
here
in
the
--
in
holding
otherwise.
there
--
there
are
certain
rules
of
judicial
interpretation
that
i
think
should
apply
to
a
situation
like
this.
they're
accepted
rules
and
of
course,
the
--
the
modern
rule
which
is
merely
a
codification
of
the
established
rules
of
courts,
as
your
rules
of
civil
procedure,
rule
60
(b)
which
provides
that
a
court
can
--
can
set
aside
a
final
decision
in
the
interest
of
justice
because
of
the
circumstances
set
forth
in
that
rule.
and
--
mr.
robert
ash
no.
the
--
this
--
the
rule
of
civil
procedure
by
their
very
words
apply
to
united
states
district
courts,
but
i
say
they
are
a
codification
that's
accepted
and
established
rules
and
they're
in
accordance
with
the
modern
trend.
the
courts
are
going
to
have
justice
synonymous
with
law.
mr.
robert
ash
no,
it
did
not.
and
it
didn't
in
the
draft
board
case.
it
didn't
--
and
--
and
you
have
lots
and
lots
of
other
cases
up
here
in
a
similar
situation.
i
have
in
mind
the
--
the
california
eastern
lines
case
which
was
a
case
on
appeal
from
the
tax
court
because
the
tax
court
has
a
power
to
handle
renegotiation
cases.
and
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
such
cases
shall
not
be
reviewed
or
redetermined
by
any
court
or
agency.
the
tax
court
decided
that
a
particular
contract
was
not
a
renegotiable
contract.
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
they
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
this
court
reversed.
we've
had
lots
and
lots
of
--
of
cases
that
float
around
this
problem
but
don't
hit
it
exactly,
one
of
them
--
another
one
--
a
case
of
this
court
is
the
industrial
edition
association
against
commissioner,
decided
in
1945.
in
that
case,
a
taxpayer
filed
no
return.
it
lost
before
the
tax
court
an
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit,
but
under
the
statute,
it
should
have
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
court
of
columbia.
now,
more
than
three
months
after
the
date
of
the
tax
court
decision,
the
party
stipulated
that
the
sixth
circuit
could
hear
the
case.
then
the
government
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
sixth
circuit
granted
that
motion.
this
court
reversed.
the
--
and
say
there
have
been
numerous,
numerous
other
--
other
cases
on
the
same
subject
to
the
powers
of
court.
now,
we
have
the
--
have
before
this
court
a
bankruptcy
case
in
1937,
the
wayne
united
gas
company
case
where
this
court
held
that
a
bankruptcy
court
may
set
aside
an
order
dismissing
a
petition
and
rehear
the
case
after
the
time
for
appeal
had
expired.
i
quote
that
and
rely
on
it
of
course
in
my
brief.
the
--
in
deciding
the
case,
the
court
said,
"we
think
this
court
--
the
court
had
power
for
good
reason
to
revise
its
judgments
upon
reasonable
application,
seasonable
application
and
before
rights
it
vested
on
the
faith
of
this
--
of
its
action.”
the
courts
of
law
and
equity
have
that
power.
and
certainly,
there's
no
more
need
of
finality
in
a
tax
case
than
there
is
in
a
bankruptcy
case
because
the
rights
of
third
parties
are
not
involved
in
any
of
these
tax
cases.
all
the
--
this
court
has
had
some
cases
before
it
involving
your
power
to
grant
the
petitions
for
rehearing
in
tax
court
cases.
the
one
that
--
the
latest
one,
the
one
the
government
relies
on
principally
is
the
simpson
case.
now,
the
statute
says
that
this
decision
shall
become
final
upon
the
denial
of
certiorari.but
you
say,
you
don't
--
that
is
what
it
means.
it
means,
according
to
the
majority
of
the
court,
it
becomes
final
upon
25
days
after
the
denial
of
certiorari.
when
mr.
justice
douglas
--
well,
mr.
justice
murphy
nothing,
mr.
justice
rutledge,
concurring
was
the
opinion
that
that
rule
--
that
decision
arose
out
of
your
rule
making
power
and
that
you
have
the
power
at
all,
they
had
it
for
the
whole
term
and
then
--
then
they
could
have
vacated
and
set
aside
the
decision
at
anytime
during
the
--
the
term.
there,
i
would
say
there
have
been
other
cases
of
a
similar
nature
were
courts
are
involved.
hill
against
hawes
came
up
here
in
1944.
there,
a
judgment
was
entered
by
the
district
court
to
the
district
of
columbia,
but
the
clerk
failed
to
notify
the
parties.
after
the
appeal
time
had
expired,
the
district
court
ordered
a
new
--
entered
a
new
judgment
and
directed
the
clerk
to
notify
the
parties.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
dismissed.
however,
this
court
reversed,
saying
that
the
judgment
was
under
the
control
of
the
court
during
the
term.
mr.
robert
ash
hill
against
hawes,
320
u.s.520.
mr.
robert
ash
the
tax
court
does
not
have
terms.
mr.
robert
ash
no,
no,
it's
never
had
terms,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
robert
ash
yes.
mr.
robert
ash
i
would
say
that
that's
the
general
rule
and
yes,
i
have
to
admit
that.
mr.
robert
ash
that's
right.
mr.
robert
ash
yes,
sir.
if
you
are
going
to
--
if
you're
going
to
sit
up
here
and
say
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
declare
acts
unconstitutional,
treasury
regulations
invalid,
and
do
other
things
that
a
court
does,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
it
does
us
some
good
that
we
also
ought
to
have
it
held
to
be
a
court.
mr.
robert
ash
well,
you
have
approved
their
action
in
holding
acts
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
ash
they
used
it
too.
mr.
robert
ash
so
did
they,
that's
right.
that's
right.
but
to
put
--
but
i'm
sure
that
this
court
would
say
that
an
administrative
agency
would
have
no
power
to
even
pass
such
a
question.
now,
i
--
another
d.c.
case
or
a
district
of
columbia
case
that
did
not
come
here
that
i
cite
in
the
reply
brief
is
the
turbeville
case
where
--
which
pretty
much
like
this
one,
where
an
attorney
filed
--
failed
to
file
an
answer
because
the
complaint
become
--
became
mixed
with
another
file.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
held
that
was
excusable
neglect
under
rule
60,
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
they
--
of
course
the
--
the
books
are
filled
with
cases
on
it
where
the
rights
of
individuals
or
litigants
will
be
protected
if
due
to
some
oversight
of
counsel,
their
rights
taken
away
from
them.
yesterday,
upon
an
old
case
in
10
wallace,
united
sates
against
vigil,
v-i-g-i-l
where
an
appeal
was
not
timely
taken
due
according
to
a
wording
of
the
court,
be
in
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney
and
that
this
court
found
a
way
to
--
to
help.
but
now,
i
--
i
mentioned
the
--
the
california
case,
the
ninth
circuit
has
recently
accepted
jurisdiction
and
a
excess
profit
tax
relief
case
in
helms
bakery
company
which
i
cite
in
my
brief,
despite
the
fact
that
section
732
of
the
internal
revenue
code
says
that
the
--
this
relief
provision
shall
not
be
reviewed
by
any
other
court
or
agency.
however,
the
court
--
the
ninth
circuit
argued
that
the
findings
were
not
in
--
the
conclusions
were
not
in
accordance
with
the
evidentiary
findings
of
the
--
of
the
tax
court
and
remand
it.
now,
the
--
now,
the
other
remark
i
have
is
that
the
--
the
government's
brief
says
that
this
--
in
these
cases
that
the
tax
cannot
be
assessed
until
the
tax
court
become
--
decision
becomes
final.
that
certainly
is
not
true
in
all
cases
and
in
his
appeal,
if
you
lose
in
the
tax
court,
the
commissioner
can
--
can
assess
the
tax
and
does
assess
it
unless
you
file
upon
before
you
file
your
appeal.
the
statement
i
have
in
the
brief
carefully
trace
the
history
of
the
tax
court.
i
think,
it
is
a
--
is
a
--
it's
construed
by
both
congress
and
the
courts
as
being
in
fact
a
court
and
i
think
it
should
be
given
the
power
of
a
court
and
if
it
isn't
recognized
that
it
has
the
power
of
a
court,
it
can
cause
all
kinds
of
confusion
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
mr.
robert
ash
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions.
the
decision
of
the
tax
court
is
equivalent
to
judgment
in
ordinary
court,
sometimes
are
entered
promptly,
sometimes
it's
quite
a
question
of
many
months
if
there
has
to
be
a
computation
under
the
tax
court's
rule
50.
i
must
admit
that
in
the
case
where
a
single
issue
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
government
or
in
favor
of
either
party
that
ordinarily
it
wouldn't
take
long
to
get
the
decision.
but
there
--
it
frequently
happens
if
they're
not
issued
immediately
as
counsel
would
indicate.
now,
the
statement
was
made
that
the
inference
was
that
this
--
possibly,
the
decision
was
vacated
to
give
a
new
trial.
the
fact
is
that
this
a
close
and
difficult
case
on
the
merits.
as
i
stated,
it
took
ms.
harron
two
years
and
four
months
to
decide
it.
we
made
a
good
showing
to
her
as
to
what
we
have
proved
if
we
have
a
rehearing.
we
put
on
competent
witnesses
who
proved
good
important
facts
and
--
and
no
doubt
in
the
world
about
the
sincerity
of
the
tax
court
in
--
in
granting
the
rehearing
and
their
effort
to
get
the
right
answer.
also,
i
think
it's
--
if
i
haven't
already
emphasized
here,
this
lasky
who
is
76
years
old
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
finds
himself
with
a
staggering
deficiency
with
his
tax
with
his
property
all
subjected
to
tax
lien
and
will
take
everything
he
owns
if
he
loses
this
case
in
the
court.
we
think
that
--
that
this
court
under
its
decisions
could
give
him
the
right
of
appeal.
it
certainly
should
have
that
vital
appeal
to
try
out
the
case
on
its
merits
--
on
his
merits.
