mr.
r.
e.
l.

i
may
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
raised
two
questions.
first,
he
says
that
this
is
a
delivery
at
the
end
of
a
continuous
journey
on
interstate
commerce
and
hence
it
is
not
subject
to
a
tax.
second,
that
it
is
discriminatory.
first,
we
would
like
to
deal
with
the
two
propositions
which
you
asserted
in
the
jurisdiction
--
the
jurisdictional
statement
separately.
there
have
been
numerous
cases
by
this
court
over
a
period
of
many,
many
years
dealing
with
the
question
of
municipal
licenses
and
state
licenses
on
matters
involving
interstate
commerce
in
the
conflict
with
the
commerce
clause.
our
time
is
too
short
to
discuss
all
of
those
cases
in
detail
but
i
would
like
to
say
briefly
that
in
early
history
of
those
cases
the
decisions
were
very
narrow
in
their
scope.
the
decisions
almost
universal
--
universally
held
that
anything
which
in
any
amount
touched
interstate
commerce
constituted
an
imposition
on
interstate
commerce
and
was
an
improper
burden.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
berwind-white
case
opinion
was
delivered,
it
was
held
by
municipal
authorities
as
a
very
liberal
construction
on
the
part
of
this
court.
it
was
interpreted
as
having
--
actually
announced
new
law
as
having
perhaps
overcome
the
previous
narrow
decisions
which
had
been
written
during
a
period
of
100
years
before.
now,
briefly
the
berwind-white
case
and
its
rather
amazing
that
both
counsel
rely
upon
the
same
opinion.
briefly,
the
berwind-white
case
announces
three
propositions
that
we
are
primarily
interested
in.
the
first
proposition
it
firmly
establishes
that
a
local
tax
may
be
levied
at
the
point
of
delivery.
i
believe
that
in
the
berwind-white
case
that
it
said
that
the
taxable
thing
was
the
passing
of
title.
but
in
the
case
which
was
decided
a
short
time
later,
i
believe
it's
known
as
the
fuel
corporation
case.
that
is
fuel
corporation
versus
taylor.
they
said
it
was
not
necessarily
the
passing
of
title
which
determined
it
but
it
was
the
passing
of
possession
which
was
the
taxable
event.
now,
we
say
that
under
the
berwind-white
decision,
the
fuel
corporation
case,
there
is
no
question
but
that
a
municipality
may
tax
the
incident
of
change
in
possession.
that
is
the
incident
of
local
delivery
that
we
think
is
very,
very
clearly
established.
now,
the
opelika
ordinance
simply
says
that
any
person
who
unloads
or
delivers
wholesale
groceries
is
subject
to
this
tax.
now,
that
is
certainly
a
tax
directly
levied
upon
the
change
in
possession
and
under
the
berwind-white
case,
it
is
certainly
entirely
justified.
the
next
proposition
which
the
berwind-white
case
laid
down
affirmatively,
i
believe
it
had
been
touched
upon
probably
in
the
western
livestock
case
prior
to
that
time,
but
it
--
it
asserted
in
so
many
terms
that
there
was
no
reason
why
interstate
commerce
should
not
bear
its
fair
share
of
the
local
tax
burden.
prior
to
do
that
time,
interstate
commerce
had
been
a
sacred
cow,
insofar
as
bearing
any
share
of
the
local
tax
burden
was
concerned,
but
by
that
decision
and
subsequent
decisions
it
has
been
conclusively
established
that
interstate
commerce
at
the
point
of
delivery
should
bear
its
fair
and
just
and
reasonable
part
of
the
local
tax
power.
the
third
proposition
which
was
asserted
and
asserted
affirmatively
was
that
the
case
of
nippert
versus
the
city
of
richmond
and
some
robbins
versus
shelby
county
taxing
district
and
the
other
so-called
drummer
cases
are
cases
which
are
very,
very
narrow
in
their
scope.
the
decision
explicitly
says
that
this
--
that
we
do
not
overrule
these
decisions,
but
that
we
limit
them
in
their
scope
to
the
solicitation
of
business,
though
as
they
say
that
you
cannot
levy
a
tax
upon
solicitation.
now,
the
next
question
is,
does
that
bar
a
flat
license
sum
tax?
in
this
case
a
flat
tax
is
levied
of
--
of
$250.
as
suggested
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
perhaps
by
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
city
of
opelika
had
levied
a
flatsum
tax
on
all
local
wholesalers
of
$250
and
a
flatsum
tax
of
$250,
would
there
be
any
discrimination?
we
most
respectively
submit
that
under
the
berwind-white
case
there
is
absolutely
nothing
which
precludes
a
flatsum
license.
we
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
a
municipality
that
is
a
small
municipality
of
some
$12,000
or
$13,000
to
attempt
to
levy
and
collect
from
a
non-resident
corporation
doing
business
in
that
city
anything
other
than
a
flatsum
license
tax.
those
simple
reason
that
the
records
of
the
company
are
not
available,
there
is
no
means
by
which
the
tax
can
be
enforced
unless
you
resort
to
perhaps
the
states
of
georgia
or
the
states
of
tennessee,
and
so
as
a
matter
of
practical
application
the
municipalities
have
found
and
that
is
a
especially
small
municipalities
that
a
flatsum
license
tax
is
necessarily
levied.
so
we
submit
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
in
a
flatsum
license
tax
levied
on
the
incident
of
delivery.
now,
the
question
--
he
says
you
pay
this
before
you
do
business.
the
license
tax
as
it
reads
says
that
upon
the
--
that
any
person
unloading
or
delivering
goods
shall
pay
this
tax.
it
is
a
tax
on
the
transfer
of
possession
which
was
the
tax
expressly
approved
by
the
court
in
the
fuel
corporation
case.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
there
--
there
is
a
penalty
provision,
yes.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
a
penalty?
i
believe
that
your
maximum
fine
for
doing
business
without
a
license
is
--
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
--
a
$100
in
municipal
corporation.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
no,
sir,
they
--
they
would
not
be
the
violator
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
this
--
this
--
the
--
the
appellant
would
be
the
person
who
was
unloading
and
delivering
and
who
was
making
the
change
of
possession
--
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
--
the
local
grocery
store
would
simply
be
accepting
possession.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
yes,
but
in
--
in
--
i
believe
that
--
that
is
your
so-called
sales
tax
of
course
--
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
--
which
is
in
a
different
category.
however,
the
berwind
case
made
the
vendor
liable
for
that
tax
--
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
--
it
had
provisions
whereby
it
might
be
passed
on.
we
--
this
court
of
course
has
passed
upon
use
taxes
which
compliment
the
sales
tax,
in
fact
for
every
state
in
the
union.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
the
nippert
case
is
a
case
on
solicitation.
the
--
the
supreme
court
in
the
nippert
case
said
that
it
was
on
solicitation
is
this
so-called
drummer
case.
in
berwind
versus
white,
the
court
expressly
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
differentiation
in
the
nippert
case.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
whether
you
--
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
whether
you
ever
sell
anything,
whether
you
ever
deliver
anything
you
are
responsible
for
that
tax
if
you
so
much
as
go
to
a
man
and
solicit
his
business.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
perhaps,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
we
say
that
--
we
say
that
the
tax
is
levied
on
--
on
a
local
incident
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
journey
in
interstate
commerce,
that
is
the
local
incident
of
delivery
which
is
the
change
of
possession
and
which
a
taxable
event.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
it's
--
it's
on
all
deliveries
which
may
be
made
during
the
year.
yes,
it
gives
him
--
it
gives
him
the
license
of
the
privilege
of
making
deliveries
for
--
for
the
further
remainder
of
that
tax
year.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
well,
we
might
say
it
is
a
tax
on
the
continuous
incident
of
delivery
but
without
change
in
possession
and
without
a
delivery
within
the
municipal
corporation,
there
can
be
not
tax.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
now,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
black,
that
they
have
held
in
one
of
the
cases
and
i
--
and
i
think
it
was
sales
tax
case
and
i
--
i
admit
that
i
do
not
recall.
but
there
--
there
was
a
scheme
device
in
--
in
just
such
a
manner
whereby
if
one
delivered
by
the
railroad,
but
what
they
did
was
in
an
attempt
to
get
around
the
berwind
case
they
shipped
the
property
f.o.b.
from
the
--
from
the
adjoining
state.
and
that
was
when
they
said
that
while
the
title
might
have
passed
or
might
have
changed
in
the
adjoining
state
at
the
point
of
the
f.o.b.
shipment
that
still
the
possession
was
the
taxable
act
and
was
subject
to
it.
there
--
there
are
a
great
many
old
cases
which
as
i
say
are
very
difficult
to
--
to
reconcile
because
in
the
--
in
the
many,
many
years
which
preceded
the
berwind-white
case
there
was
very
little
if
anything
that
you
could
do
toward
making
interstate
commerce
bear
any
part
of
the
burden.
the
delivery
view
has
come,
i
believe
there
was
the
covington
case
which
immediately
preceded
that
and
--
and
which
was
fairly
liberal
in
its
view.
it
has
only
been
recent
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
interstate
commerce
should
bear
a
part
of
the
municipal
burden.
now,
with
the
court's
permission
i
--
i'll
proceed
to
the
second
part
of
my
argument
because
i
know
that
my
time
is
beginning
to
run
just
a
little
short.
the
next
is
assistance
by
counsel
is
that
the
tax
which
is
here
levied
is
discriminatory.
now,
he
says
that
it
is
discriminatory
on
its
face.
we'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
fact
that
first
all
municipal
taxes
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
i
assume
in
other
states
are
levied
by
virtue
of
--
of
legislative
authority.
the
legislature
authorizes
the
--
the
levy
of
the
tax.
in
this
particular
case
the
--
the
code
of
alabama
provides
that
a
tax
may
be
levied
by
municipalities
for
the
purpose
of
raising
revenue
and
also
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers
either
or
both.
we
think
that
the
--
the
significant
part
of
that
statute
of
course
is
the
portion
which
gives
the
municipality
the
privilege
of
levying
a
license
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers.
now,
in
the
--
in
levying
a
license
in
the
exercise
of
police
powers,
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
municipality
must
have
the
right
to
classify.
and
actually,
(inaudible)
being
one
classification,
retail
grocery
store
might
be
at
another
classification.
therefore
without
question
your
municipal
authority
has
the
right
to
classify
various
types
of
businesses
in
connection
with
the
exercise
of
that
police
power.
now,
in
this
particular
case
they
have
classified
merchants
who
operate
places
of
business
within
the
city
in
one
category.
they
have
classified
merchants
who
bring
wholesale
groceries
in
from
other
points
and
from
without
in
levy
category.
the
question
therefore
with
which
we
are
presented
is
whether
or
not
that
is
a
valid
classification.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
view
a
brief
with
my
manner
in
which
this
case
arose.
they
filed
a
complaint
which
in
substance
alleges
that
they
were
doing
the
business
and
sets
forth
these
various
municipal
ordinances
which
are
involved.
they
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
these
--
these
two
ordinances
constituted
a
discrimination.
now,
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
repeatedly
that
a
business
may
be
classified
under
the
police
powers
where
it
operates
from
a
given
place
of
business
within
the
municipality
and
where
goods
are
brought
in
from
without
the
municipality
and
that
such
a
classification
is
presumptively
a
valid
classification.
it
is
recognized
that
in
the
exercise
of
your
police
powers,
your
municipal
police
powers
are
that
you
have
--
you
exercise
a
certain
control
over
your
local
merchant,
they
are
subject
to
your
jurisdiction.
you
are
confronted
with
an
entirely
different
problem
when
you
have
itinerant
merchant
bringing
goods
in
from
other
states
or
elsewhere
and
--
and
selling
those
goods.
therefore,
the
court
has
said
that
a
classification
of
a
local
store
as
contrasted
with
the
classification
of
a
store
which
is
beyond
the
city
is
presumptively,
and
i
use
the
word
presumptively
advisably,
is
presumptively
a
valid
classification.
now,
the
corollary
to
that
is
that
if
it
is
presumptively
a
valid
classification
then
the
allegations
which
are
contained
in
the
complaint
constitute
a
conclusion
of
law.
when
he
says
that
this
ordinance
is
discriminate
against
me,
he
isn't
alleging
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
conclusion
of
law.
our
end
was
upon
that
theory
that
the
trial
court
sustained
the
demurrer.
it
was
upon
that
theory
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
sustained
the
demurrers
of
the
lower
court.
they
say
and
the
rule
of
practice
and
procedure
has
always
been
in
the
state
of
alabama
that
if
you
allege
in
order
to
allege
a
discrimination,
you
must
allege
the
facts
which
constitute
the
discrimination.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
fraud
and
deceit
in
many
other
actions.
and
the
court
in
substance
says
that
we
have
what
is
prima
facie,
a
valid
classification,
it
is
not
inherently
bad
on
its
face.
therefore
the
burden
rests
upon
the
appellant
in
this
case
to
allege
facts
showing
that
this
does
actually
discriminate
against
me.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
not
necessarily.
that
gets
back
to
your
question
of
classification.
if
you
have
one
--
one
business
in
one
classification
then
that
is
a
valid
classification
prima
facie,
then
you
have
a
right
to
apply
a
different
rate
to
him
and
what
you
do
to
a
man
in
another
classification.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
there
is
a
limit
of
course.
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
not
in
the
position
of
having
to
say
it
here,
that
this
is
either
a
valid
tax
or
an
invalid
tax.they
say
if
there
is
a
discrimination,
you
simply
allege
the
facts
to
show
the
discrimination
and
the
tax
will
be
tossed
out.
mr.
r.
e.
l.
cope
i
just
found
on
the
grounds
of
classification
that
--
that
this
is
a
valid
classification,
that
in
connection
not
for
revenue,
you
can't
justify
the
revenue
but
we
justified
under
the
exercise
of
the
police
powers.
mr.
r.
e.
l.

the
--
the
fact
that
--
well,
perhaps
--
perhaps
i
--
i
should,
if
i
may
give
you
an
illustration
which
is
not
necessarily
applies
to
west

wholesale
grocery
company,
but
which
applies
to
transients
in
general.
under
--
under
the
--
as
a
part
of
the
police
powers
it
is
a
part
of
the
duty
to
protect
the
citizens
against
fraud
and
deceit.
now,
we
may
have
a
truckload
of
genuine
(inaudible)
rugs
which
were
manufactured
in

in
brooklyn
brought
in
to
our
city,
which
are
sold,
they

shoddy,
they

the
people

they're
gone
tomorrow.
the

power
in

to
protect

people
against
fraud

in
order

mr.

he

mr.

i

i
would
hesitate
to
answer
your

for

simple

ordinance
in
the

i

after.
and
it
was
your

it
provides
your
procedure

for
the
issuance

licenses,
all
those
things
are
covered
in
one
license
ordinance.
that
--
that
of
course
is
our

our
entire
contest
on

that
it's

it's
within
the
police
power.

mr.

that

that,

is
a
question
that
we
raised,
is
that
where
it
is
within
the
police
power
granted
by
the
state
and
the
burden
rests
upon
the
person
who
is
challenging
the
ordinance
to
allege
the
facts
and
to
show
the
facts
that
it
is
a
discrimination
or
that
it
is
an
abuse
or
is
an
improper
exercise.
we
simply
say
that
presumptively
this
was
sound
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
that
presumptively
it
was
sound.
now,
as
matter
of
actual
proof,
as
a
matter

actual
fact
it
might
be

that's
rather
difficult
to

prohibitive.
i
don't

prohibitive
on

we

to
write
an
ordinance
with
which
we
try
to
protect
the
entire
community.
and
we

we
certainly
can't
make
that
differential
on
only
one
delivery

the
