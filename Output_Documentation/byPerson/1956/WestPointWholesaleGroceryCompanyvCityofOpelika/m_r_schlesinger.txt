mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
city
of
opelika,
alabama
has
imposed
a
flatsum
license
tax
upon
local
merchants
--
upon
non-local
merchants
entering
its
jurisdiction
from
the
outside.
a
tax
necessarily
discriminatory
in
its
operation
and
indeed
a
tax
which
is
discriminatory
and
in
regard
merely
to
the
face
of
the
ordinance
itself
in
view
of
a
contrasting
rate
structure
applied
to
local
merchants.
this
controversy
reaches
this
court
upon
appeal
from
a
fine
judgment
by
an
alabama
court
of
appeals.
that
court
of
appeals
in
turn
affirmed
an
alabama
trial
court's
action
in
sustaining
the
defendant
city's
demurrer
to
the
plaintiff's
complaint
for
refund
of
tax.
the
alabama
supreme
court
having
denied
certiorari,
the
appeal
has
been
taken
from
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court.
since
this
appeal
calls
into
action
--
calls
into
question
the
state
courts'
action
upon
the
defendant's
demurrer,
the
fact
as
set
out
in
the
plaintiff's
compliant
are
of
critical
importance.
may
i
therefore
review
those
facts
in
a
rather
brief
fashion.
section
82
of
the
opelika
city
license
schedule
for
the
year
1953
imposed
an
annual
license
or
privilege
tax
upon
wholesale
merchants.
that
tax
was
according
to
certain
graduated
amounts
depending
upon
the
bracket
of
gross
business,
annual
gross
business
into
which
the
merchant
happened
to
fall.
by
way
of
example,
your
honors
will
observe
that
the
lowest
bracket
requiring
a
tax
of
$35
was
where
the
merchant
did
less
than
100,000
of
business
a
year,
the
top
amount
of
$250
was
reached
when
the
merchant's
business
exceeded
to
a
million
dollars
per
year.
and
in
addition,
section
82
imposed
a
tax
at
a
very
small
fraction
of
1%
upon
the
gross
business
done
by
the
merchant.
now,
that,
if
the
court
please,
is
section
82
but
section
82
applies
only
to
wholesalers
delivering
wares
in
the
city
of
opelika
from
a
point
within
opelika.
for
merchants
delivering
goods
from
outside
opelika
into
the
city
of
opelika,
two
special
sections
are
applicable.
the
first
of
those
special
sections
is
section
130.
it
imposes
on
merchants
--
on
persons
and
firms
et
cetera
bringing
goods
in
from
outside
and
delivering
them
in
opelika,
an
annual
tax
of
$100.
that,
however,
is
inapplicable
to
wholesale
grocers
who
bring
goods
in
from
outside
the
city.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
special
section
if
i
may
say
a
special,
special
section,
section
130
(a),
which
is
the
section
with
which
this
court
is
primarily
concerned.
section
130
(a)
imposes
an
annual
flatsum
license
tax
of
$250
upon
wholesale
grocers
who
deliver
in
the
city
of
opelika
wares
which
they
have
brought
in
--
grocers
--
groceries
which
they
have
brought
in
from
outside
of
the
city.
may
i
therefore
review
in
very
bird's
eye
fashion
the
three
taxing
patterns
that
we
have
here.
we
have
here
section
130
(a),
imposing
an
annual
license
tax
of
$250
on
wholesale
grocers
who
bring
in
to
opelika
from
outside
the
city
groceries.
secondly,
we
have
a
$100
annual
license
tax,
not
of
primary
concern
here
which
applies
to
others
bringing
in
merchandise
from
outside
the
city
and
delivering
in
the
city.
finally,
we
have
under
section
82
a
favorable
rate
structure,
a
structure
geared
to
gross
receipts
but
applicable
only
to
merchants
delivering
goods
in
opelika
from
a
point
within
the
city
of
opelika.
now,
as
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
action,
the
plaintiff
is
a
wholesale
grocer
who
delivered
from
his
business
over
in
georgia
groceries
to
his
retail
merchant
customers
in
the
city
of
opelika.
those
deliveries
were
pursuant
to
orders
taken
by
its
salesmen
which
orders
were
transmitted
over
to
the
plaintiff
in
georgia
and
accepted
by
it
in
georgia.
the
shipments,
made
pursuant
to
those
orders,
were
in
a
continuous
movement
in
the
interstate
commerce
from
georgia
into
alabama.
the
plaintiff
is
a
georgia
corporation.
its
only
place
of
business
is
in
georgia.
it
has
no
inventory
stock
of
goods
or
office
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir.
that
is
quite
right,
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
that
would
prompt
me
to
observe
that
the
fact
that
this
tax
is,
you
might
say,
more
rather
than
less
discriminatory
or
more
rather
than
less
burdensome
on
non-local
business
does
not
make
it
any
of
the
less
discriminatory
or
burdensome
against
interstate
business.
but
your
honor
is
quite
right,
the
discrimination
involved
here
was
not
merely
against
georgia
business
let
us
say
but
could
very
well
have
applied
to
birmingham
shippers
as
well.
the
plaintiff
paid
the
$250
pursuant
to
section
130
(a),
required
of
it
to
enter
this
opelika
market
and
it
then
brought
this
suit
for
refund,
filing
a
complaint
for
refund
of
tax
based
upon
constitutional
grounds
and
particularly
upon
the
principle
that
section
130
(a)
involving
a
$250
flatsum
license
tax
violates
the
commerce
clause
as
being
an
undue
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
and
as
being
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir.
it
had
to
pay
the
shipment
--
it
had
to
pay
the
tax
in
advance
and
that
is
brought
out
by
section
d,
the
penalty
section.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir,
each
year.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
it
paid
it
on
february
15
of
1953
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
oh,
no.
oh,
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
but
in
order
to
enter
the
market
there's
a
preliminary
it
has
to
pay
the
$250.
and
if
the
court
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
oh,
yes,
sir,
i
would
and
i
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
would
still
be
here,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
one
of
our
two
points
as
your
honor's
question
suggest
and
i
should
like
to
dwell
on
that
at
a
little
greater
length
in
a
moment
if
i
may.
i
was
adverting
to
the
plaintiff's
complaint
and
as
i've
already
indicated,
the
defendant's
demurrer
to
that
complaint
was
sustained
so
we're
here
on
the
facts
as
set
out
in
that
complaint.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
tax
constituted
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce
for
two
reasons.
and
before
adverting
to
the
point
made
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
i
first
observe
that
our
first
ground
for
complaint
here
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
in
view
of
the
more
favorable
fair
tax
structure
which
was
applied
to
local
merchants.
and
i
refer
in
particular
in
that
case
and
in
this
connection
it
becomes
necessary
to
look
at
section
82
of
the
city
license
schedule.
section
82
imposes
a
graduated
tax
approximately
proportionate
to
gross
receipts
on
local
merchants.
section
130
(a)
by
contrast
imposes
upon
wholesale
grocers
delivering
groceries
from
a
point
outside
opelika
the
flatsum
tax
of
$250.
and
i
think
it
is
of
some
interest
to
this
court
surely
in
connection
with
this
first
proposition
that
in
order
for
our
plaintiff
taxpayer
over
in
georgia,
required
to
pay
this
$250
tax,
to
bring
his
rate
of
taxation
down
to
the
rate
paid
by
local
wholesale
grocers.
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
ship
in
and
sell
in
this
community
of
something
less
than
13,000
soaps
in
amount
of
groceries
at
wholesale
prices
in
excess
in
one
single
year,
in
excess
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir.
what
i
attempted
to
do,
mr.
justice
black,
is
to
take
section
82
and
compute
at
what
point
a
local
merchant
would
have
paid
$250
under
that
graduated
schedule
and
it
happens
to
break
at
$280,000.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
oh,
no,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
referring
--
i
am
referring
to
this
business.
the
point
being
that
in
view
of
the
contrasting
treatment
between
section
82
on
the
one
hand
and
section
130
(a)
on
the
other
hand,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
a
more
flagrant
attempt
by
local
merchants,
by
local
wholesale
grocers
to
thwart
out-of-state
non-local
business
in
competition
with
them
can
scarcely
be
imagined.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
may
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
say
that,
sir,
because
the
statute
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
oh,
it
would
--
it
would
operate
against
the
montgomery
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
merchant
as
well.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
said
out-of-state
and
then
i
--
in
a
series
i
said
non-local,
meaning
to
say
that
this
is
not
confined
to
out-of-state
and
in
your
honor's
point
if
i
may
presume
to
say
so
is
very
well
taken.
it
is
--
it
is
--
they've
got
the
fence
around
opelika
so
to
speak
and
everything
out
of
opelika
is
thwarted
but
included
of
course
and
out
of
opelika
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
is
your
interstate
commerce.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
to
your
honor
that
of
course
we
have
here
a
city
of
opelika
tax
and
i
will
point
out
to
your
honors
that
in
the
berwind-white
opinion
to
which
i
want
to
refer
in
just
a
moment
in
footnote
11,
this
court
through
mr.
justice
stone
adverted
to
a
law
review
article,
your
berwind-white
opinion
was
in
1940,
adverted
to
a
law
review
article
pointing
out
that
there
were
more
than
800
municipal
flatsum
license
taxes
designed
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
out
non-local
competition.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
that's
right.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
that's
right.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
that's
right.
that's
right,
sir.
now,
may
i
advert
to
the
second
proposition
which
was
suggested
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
a
second
reason
and
in
this
connection,
it
is
unnecessary
to
look
to
section
82,
it
is
unnecessary
at
any
rate
to
dwell
on
the
treatment,
the
favorable
treatment,
the
fair
treatment
which
is
accorded
to
the
local
merchants
pursuant
to
that
graduated
gross
receipts
tax.
suffice
to
say
in
this
connection
that
wholesale
grocers
dealing
in
interstate
commerce
are
subject
under
section
130
(a)
to
a
flatsum
license
tax.
a
flatsum
tax
which
they
must
pay,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested,
before
they
enter
the
market
and
a
flatsum
tax
which
must
be
paid
regardless
of
the
amount
of
business
done.
in
nippert
against
city
of
richmond
in
1946,
the
supreme
court
carefully
delineated
the
discriminatory
nature
of
the
flatsum
taxes
as
applied
against
any
incident
of
the
interstate
commerce.
and
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
it
reaffirmed
and
reemphasized
its
position
respecting
these
flatsum
license
taxes
as
are
brought
out
in
the
long
line
of
cases,
the
so-called
drummer
cases
starting
with
robbins
against
shelby
county
taxing
district
back
in
1887.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
that
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
think,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
that
it
clearly
would.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
think
it
clearly
would.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
it
would,
based
on
prior
authority
by
this
court.
i
refer
particularly
to
nippert
against
city
of
richmond.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
it
was
on
the
--
it
was
in
the
--
in
the
nippert
case.
it
was
on
the
local
fellow
not
having
an
established
place
of
business.
it
was
the
same
as
on
the
person
who
brought
in
from
out-of-state.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
it
was
or
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
don't
recall
which
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion
there,
expressed
some
contradictory
views
based
on
the
fact
that
local
merchants
having
a
place
of
business
in
the
jurisdiction,
the
tax
to
which
they
were
subject
was
not
indicated
in
the
record
which
was
before
the
court.
but
if
the
court
please,
the
essence
of
the
distinction
taken
by
this
court
in
its
berwind-white
opinion
between
flatsum
license
taxes
on
the
one
hand
and
in
that
case
a
sales
tax
on
the
other
hand
was
equality
of
rate
structure.
now,
this
local
municipality
can
provide
for
equality
of
rate
structure,
it
hasn't
done
that
though.
so
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
pardon
me?
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
should
think
they
could
do
it,
if
your
honor
please,
either
by
a
compensating
use
or
property
tax
or
if
they
want
to
follow
what
is
perhaps
the
invitation
suggested
by
this
court
in
--
in
its
berwind-white
opinion
by
a
sales
tax
on
the
sales
in
the
jurisdiction
even
though
they'd
be
interstate
sales.
and
may
i
dwell
on
that
point
for
just
a
moment
since
your
honor
has
asked
the
question.
the
court
will
recall
in
the
berwind-white
opinion,
this
court
held
that
a
tax
on
an
interstate
sale
by
the
point
of
destination,
in
that
case
it
was
new
york
city,
is
constitutional
their
being
equality
of
rate
with
local
sales
and
the
seller
incidentally
having
a
local
sales
office.
now,
as
the
court
is
more
aware
than
i
am
amongst
those
outside
of
the
court,
the
debate
rages
as
to
whether
this
court
will
eventually
hold
that
the
state
of
destination
may
always
impose
a
sales
tax
whether
or
not
there
is
a
sales
office.
but
my
point
is
that
the
berwind-white
case
is
thought
to
have
gone
a
long
way
in
permitting
equality
of
rate
structure
but
we're
not
even
at
that
point
here.
we're
on
the
flatsum
license
tax.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
that's
what
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no,
sir.
but
a
license
to
do
business
measured
by
sales
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no,
sir.
i
just
want
to
draw
the
distinction
as
your
honor
is
doing.
i
wanted
to
emphasize
that.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
no,
these
flatsum
taxes
had
never
--
i
don't
think
ever
been
in
terms
of
the
discrimination
between
state
and
interstate
commerce.
i
believe
let's
take
nippert
against
city
of
richmond
or
one
of
the
alternative
grounds
under
memphis
steam
laundry
there
was
a
--
no,
i'll
strike
that,
memphis
steam
laundry
was
a
tennessee
tax
but
in
nippert,
at
any
rate,
it
was
a
local
tax.
now,
the
defendant
seeks
to
distinguish
of
all
these
supreme
court
cases,
respecting
the
invalidity
of
a
flatsum
license
tax
as
such
and
particularly
the
nippert,
the
memphis
steam
laundry
and
the
old
robbins
case
on
the
grounds
that
a
tax
and
i
quote
from
its
brief
at
page
4
from
the
defendants
brief
at
page
4,
“on
the
ground
that
the
tax
in
those
cases
was
levied
upon
the
solicitation,
the
court
will
bear
in
mind
that
the
tax
here
is
on
delivery,
was
levied
on
the
solicitation
of
sales
to
be
later
consummated
by
delivering
in
interstate
commerce."
furthermore
at

the
defendant
in
it's
brief
to
leave
no
doubts
about
that
distinction
which
the
defendant
is
seeking
to
have
this
court
adopt
says,
"this
court
has
never
said
that
there
is
any
impropriety
in
the
levy
of
a
flatsum
license
on
the
incident
of
delivery."
now,
in
point
of
fact
and
at
least
two
of
the
drummer
cases
which
recited
in
berwind-white,
caldwell
against
north
carolina
which
appears
and
i
--
we
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
filing
a
reply
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
appears
in
187
u.s.622
and
in
crenshaw
against
arkansas
227
u.s.389.
this
court
did
hold
that
a
flatsum
license
tax
on
delivery
was
bad.
i
must
concede
however
that
most
of
the
questions
which
have
arisen
before
this
court
have
involved
the
problem
of
whether
a
tax
on
solicitation
is
as
bad
as
a
tax
on
delivery.
the
court
however
has
indicated
that
it
is
but
suffice
to
say
they
were
concerned
with
delivery,
we're
concerned
with
the
worst
--
worst
leg
of
the
question
as
it
were
in
this
particular
controversy.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
that
was
187
u.s.622.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
and
the
crenshaw
case,
if
i
may
repeat
mr.
justice
douglas,
was
227
u.s.389.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
--
i
hesitate
and
say
it's
true
of
all
of
them
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
in
an
awful
or
bothersome
but
i'm
just
doing
something.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
it's
--
it's
an
entry
permit,
pay
at
the
gate
when
you
come
in
but
you've
got
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
it's
the
same
--
i
think
it's
the
same
thing,
it's
in
terms
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir,
you're
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
he
pays
$250
and
then
he
can
ship
for
the
balance
of
the
year.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
he
pays
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
because
under
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
concretely
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
the
wholesale
grocer
in
atlanta
makes
out
his
check
for
$250
to
the
city
of
opelika
and
he
pays
on
the
barrelhead
before
he
may
make
the
shipment,
and
if
he
doesn't
there's
a
penalty
in
section
d
which
is
before
your
honors.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
well
--
now,
in
furtherance
of
this
proposition
that
although
a
tax
on
delivery
is
--
although
a
tax
on
solicitation
is
good,
a
tax
on
delivery
as
in
this
case
is
all
right.
the
defendant
in
its
brief
relies
upon
this
court's
opinion
in
its
berwind-white
case.
now,
let's
just
look
at
that
case
very
briefly,
it
dealt
as
already
indicated
with
a
sale
tax
on
an
interstate
sale.
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
supreme
court
reaffirmed
at
great
length
its
flatsum
decisions.
the
defendant
at
page

quotes
from
a
sentence
from
the
remarks
of
that
court,
and
may
i
indicate
that
the
quotation
is
from
a
part
of
a
sentence
from
the
remarks
of
this
court
and
omitted
are
the
--
is
a
phrase
at
the
beginning
of
the
sentence
in
the
clause
of
the
conclusion
of
that
sentence.
be
that
as
it
may
however,
a
reading
of
that
complete
sentence
from
which
the
defendant
has
excised
the
part
and
a
reading
of
the
complete
paragraph
from
which
it
has
been
brawn
would
indicate
the
supreme
court's
thinking,
respecting
the
invalidity
of
a
flatsum
tax
not
being
confined
to
solicitation
before
commerce
and
therefore
all
right
on
delivery
itself.
if
there
is
to
be
any
distinction
and
it
is
the
defendant
who
suggest
a
distinction
between
a
tax
on
delivery
and
a
tax
on
solicitation.
surely,
the
case
wherein
validity
is
no
--
is
the
case
wherein
validity
is
clearer
when
the
tax
is
on
the
delivery
in
interstate
commerce
then
it
--
is
it
in
the
case
of
a
tax
on
solicitation
to
be
followed
by
interstate
commerce
which
is
not
to
say
however
that
the
appellant
suggests
that
any
distinction
be
made
on
that
ground
of
tweedledee
and
tweedledum.
now,
may
i
just
withdraw
from
the
trees
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
forest.
look
at
the
forest
in
terms
of
local
physical
demands
as
contrasted
with
the
desirability
and
the
constitutional
mandate
that
interstate
commerce
should
not
be
unduly
impeded.
it
might
very
well
be
that
a
local
taxing
jurisdiction
should
look
to
interstate
commerce
to
pay
a
fair
rate
of
tax
when
it
enters
the
local
taxing
jurisdiction.but
that's
a
far
cry
from
what
we
have
in
this
case.
we
have,
first
of
all,
a
flatsum
license
tax
invalid
on
its
face
in
contrast
with
a
tax
--
a
fair
apportioned
rate
against
local
business.
and
we
have
in
the
second
place
the
fact
that
there
is
probably
no
need
to
look
to
that
local
taxing
rate
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
flatsum
tax
which
must
be
paid
as
a
prerequisite
to
coming
into
the
jurisdiction,
which
must
be
paid
regardless
of
the
amount
of
business
done
is
by
virtue
of
being
a
flatsum
tax
invalid
as
applied
to
intestate
commerce.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
may
i
take
the
two
minutes
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
remaining
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i'd
like
to
dwell
on
that
procedural
aspect
which
was
discussed
by
mr.
justice
black
just
a
moment
ago.
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
i
am
not
--
first,
with
alabama
procedure
as
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
[laughs]
well,
you've
had
the
experience,
if
your
honor
please.
but
may
i
just
point
out
to
your
honor,
to
the
court.
that
i
don't
think
that
a
ruling
--
a
reading
of
the
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals
discloses
that
it
went
off
on
the
grounds
that
sufficient
facts
under
alabama
procedure
weren't
alleged.
i
think
that
some
distortion
of
the
emphasis
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
say
but
rather
that
sufficient
facts
were
not
alleged
to
bring
the
federal
constitution
into
operation.
that
is
to
say,
assuming
the
facts
were
as
stated
then
there
wasn't
a
burden
or
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
and
i
believe,
if
court
pleases,
the
cases
cited
by
court
themselves
would
bear
out
that
proposition,
this
long
fight
in
the
alabama
courts.
and
the
alabama
courts,
if
i
may
say
to
this
court,
had
not
been
reconciled
to
the
--
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
black,
have
not
been
--
mr.
m.
r.
schlesinger
--
reconciled
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
this
field.

m.
r.
schlesinger
