you
mean
(voice

--
justice

your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
this
point
in
short
is
that
the
state
can
do
what
it
will
so
long
as
it
confines
activities
within
the
state,
but
you
say
even
though
it's
a
fence
around
opelika
as
regard
to
mobile
or
montgomery
on
(inaudible),
it
may
do
that
absolute
regard
to
georgia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
interested
in
what
it
does
to
other
people
in
alabama
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
interested
in
georgia
--
justice

--
and
ohio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
also
includes
a
flat
tax,
the
same
flat
tax
on
the
local
grocery
or
on
the
local
wholesalers
sending
to
the
cities
such
as
one
in
opelika,
in
the
local
little
corner
groceries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
the
commerce
clause
preclude
the
imposition
of
a
flat
tax
of
precisely
the
same
amount
on
the
purely
local
man?
justice

if
it
imposes

--
justice

pardon
me?
justice

it
would?
justice

was
the
tax
of
the
local
fellow
the
same
as
the
one
that's
imposed
on
the
interstate
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
already
a
differentiation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
no
trouble
if
a
gross
tax
was
imposed
on
the
sales
within
the
state
by
the
outside?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
out-of-state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
suppose
the
other
thing
is
clear
by
our
decisions
that
a
mere
license
to
do
business
just
as
--
they
aren't
outside,
they
come
in
and
do
business
flat
or
the
flat
rate
unrelated
to
the
rest
of
the
case.
that's
not
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i
didn't
say
it
measured
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
is
--
this
is
not
--
not
quite
either
of
those,
is
it,
for
the
simple
--
this
also
would
be
bad
if
no
outside
or
no
--
if
--
if
there
weren't
equality
between
the
georgia
and
the
birmingham?
that's
a
complicating
factor,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
these
delivery
cases
--
in
those
cases
when
the
tax
is
--
not
the
delivery
but
the
solicitation
cases.
when
the
tax
was
paid
thereafter
you
could
ship
the
goods
in
without
any
further
tax,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
this
was
a
means
of
getting
permission
to
do
business
in
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
hear
you
say
if
you
--
before
you
deliver
you
have
to
pay,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
the
events
were
without
getting
into
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
a
--
if
a
fellow
from
atlanta
wants
to
ship
in
some
grocery,
what
does
he
do?
what
happens?
how
is
the
tax
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
does
he
pay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
if
he's
engaged
in
the
business
of
sending
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
--
suppose
the
first,
somebody
discovers
there's
a
grocery
in
atlanta
and
he
wants
a
good
from
them,
what
happens
to
state
that
concretely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
grocery
in
--
in
opelika
hears
about
a
desirable
wholesaler
in
atlanta
and
he
writes
further,
will
you
send
me
in
the
following
goods?
now,
what
is
the
wholesale
grocer
in
atlanta
do
to
conform
with
the
opelika
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
get
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
no
tax
were
paid
on
this,
if
the
good
were
just
brought
in
from
georgia
and
unload
it
at
some
grocery
store
in
opelika,
could
the
city
--
is
there
a
penalty
provision
for
this
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
penalty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
would
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
grocery
store
in
opelika
--
could
you
go
after
the
grocery
store
that
received
the
good?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
makes
this
very
different
from
berwind
and
white.
that
was
a
tax
on
the
people
who
got
control
of
new
york
on
the
purchases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
--
but
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
differentiate
the
nippert
case
from
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
nippert
tax
would
have
to
be
paid
whether
business
has
got
in
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
if
he
--
if
he's
been
getting
business
and
stuff
they
send
in
and
then
the
flat
tax
called,
you
say
that's
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
tax
the
$200
on
that
because
thereafter
you
can
do
business
for
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
talking
in
terms
of
the
cases
about
tax
event,
the
tax
event
isn't
--
the
tax
event
isn't
completed
or
that's
merely
a
condition
on
which
the
tax
falls,
namely,
if
he
sends
in
any
goods
then
he
must
pay
$200,
would
lead
to
sending
goods
thereafter
everyday
on,
how
does
he
plead
with
that?
