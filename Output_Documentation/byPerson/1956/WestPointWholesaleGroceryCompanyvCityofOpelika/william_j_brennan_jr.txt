justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
underlies
the
difference
in
classification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
illustration
you've
given,
i
take
it
the
brooklyn
rug
dealer
if
he
paid
the
$250
could
ship
in
the
shoddy
rugs,
couldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
just
what
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
what
is
it
that
the
out-of-town
wholesale
concern
has
to
supply
in
the
way
of
information?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
is
there
anything
in
this
ordinance
that
says
anything
except
that
you
paid
$250
if
you're
shipping
in
goods
from
out-of-town,
we'll
give
you
a
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
difference
in
the
burden
of
--
of
municipal
services
in
relation
to
an
outsider
than
there
is
to
a
local
merchant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean
in
terms
of
--
in
terms
of
municipal
services,
for
example
is
there
more
fire
service
or
a
different
fire
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
service
or
different
police
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
police
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
police
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
--
are
you
suggesting
that
we
should
indulge
a
presumption
that
this
higher
rate,
the
out-of-towners
is
based
upon
the
necessity
for
some
kind
of
policing
services
to
see
that
local
residents
of
opelika
are
not
defrauded
by
out-of-towners?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
mr.
cope
but
apparently
on
--
in
this
complaint,
we're
given
the
full
text
of
the
ordinance
which
appears
to
be
an
amending
ordinance
incidentally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
but
the
difficulty
i
have
is
where
factually,
do
you
support
the
--
the
classification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
make
that
same
argument
if
this
be
instead
of
$250
were
$2500?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
that
local
residency
tax.
