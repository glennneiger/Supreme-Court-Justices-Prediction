justice
stewart
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
arizona
can't
do
what?
i
didn't
quite
hear
you.
justice
stewart
and
the
principal
way
by
which
arizona
has
done
that
is
by
making
this
a
governmental
entity,
is
that--
justice
stewart
--it
had
the
power
to
condemn
before
this,
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
mr.
lee,
does
the
state
regulate
the
rates
charged
for
electricity
in
any
way,
directly
or
indirectly?
justice
stewart
to
amend
the
state
constitution,
it
has
to
be
proposed
by
the
legislature
and
then
voted--
justice
stewart
--and
a
simple
majority--
justice
stewart
salyer
did
not
involve
the
generation
of
electricity?
justice
stewart
did
not.
justice
stewart
and
how
many
electric
utility
customers
are
there
in
this
case?
justice
stewart
and
how
many
beneficiaries
of
the...
how
many
voters--
justice
stewart
--how
many
people
are
voters?
justice
stewart
well,
cases
of
this
kind,
that's
kind
of
begging
the
question,
isn't
it?
if
you
begin
with
an
entity...
a
subdivision
of
government,
then
that
perhaps
is
correct.
justice
stewart
isn't
the
issue
here
whether
this
is
an
entity
of
government?
justice
stewart
was
the
salyer
case
decided
on
the
ground
that
the
entity
there
was
so
like
a
business
that
the
rule
of
reynolds
v.
sims
was
inapplicable?
was
that
it's
rationale?
justice
stewart
it
wasn't
at
all
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
entity
there
was
so
like
a
business,
was
it?
justice
stewart
i
haven't
read
it
recently,
but
i--
justice
stewart
--right.
justice
stewart
and
which
class?
what
is
the
class
that's
being
unconstitutionally
treated?
justice
stewart
not
those
residents
who
are
users
of
electricity
or
water?
justice
stewart
but
all
residents
of
the
geographical
boundaries
of
the
district
otherwise
qualified
to
vote,
correct?
justice
stewart
i
suppose
the...
that
holding
of
the
arizona
law
has
been
in
connection
with
tort
liability,
sovereign
immunity,
hasn't
it?
justice
stewart
entirely
different
context.
justice
stewart
i
suppose
the
lawyer
was
a
landowner,
also,
wasn't
he?
justice
stewart
but
in
fact
he
was?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
of
these
cases,
no.
79-174,
ball
against
james
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
the
system
for
electing
the
directors
of
a
large
water
reclamation
district
in
arizona,
an
electoral
system
which
limits
voting
eligibility
to
landowners
and
apportions
voting
power
according
to
the
amount
of
land
a
voter
owns.
the
case
requires
us
to
consider
whether
the
peculiarly
narrow
function
of
this
local
governmental
body
and
the
special
relationship
of
one
class
of
citizens
to
that
body
releases
it
from
the
strict
demands
of
the
one-person,
one-vote
principle
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
hold
in
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
system
for
electing
directors
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall,
and
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
