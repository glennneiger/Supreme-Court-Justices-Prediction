mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
acreage
based
electoral
system
of
the
salt
river
project
agricultural
improvement
and
power
district.
salt
river
project
is
today,
and
it
always
has
been,
a
federal
water
reclamation
project.
it's
first
owner
and
operator
was
the
united
states
of
america.
the
salt
river
valley
water
users
association,
which
is
a
private
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
the
territory
of
arizona,
was
formed
in
1903
as
the
entity
which
could
perform
the
statutory
function
of
guaranteeing
the
repayment
into
the
reclamation
fund
of
the
initial
costs
advanced
by
the
united
states.
one
of
the
obligations
imposed
on
the
association
by
the
united
states
in
the
initial
1904
contract
between
the
two
was
the
commitment
that
the
only
beneficiaries
of
the
project's
water
storage
and
development
activities
would
be
the
landowners,
who
had
subscribed
their
lands
into...
membership
in
the
association.
and
that
obligation,
imposed
on
the
association
by
the
united
states,
is
still
in
effect.
so
that
from
the
beginning,
the
benefits
of
this
project
have
been
proportionate
to
land
ownership.
in
1917,
the
role
of
the
association
changed
from
guarantor
to
operator
and
for
the
next
20
years
the
care,
operation,
maintenance
and
control
of
the
project
were
vested
in
this
private
corporation.
in
1937,
the
district
was
brought
into
being
by
the
landowners
of
the
association
as
an
agricultural
improvement
district,
which
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
arizona,
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
prior
to
the
creation
of
the
district,
the
association
and
its
members
had
experienced
severe
financial
difficulties
and
the
primary
purpose
of
the
district
was
to
give
the
project
a
better
interest
rate
on
its
bonds
by
making
that
interest
tax
free.
over
the
decades,
since
1937,
the
district
has
changed
in
several
ways.
and
the
most
important
of
those
changes,
for
present
purposes,
are
two:
the
first
is
that
though
the
physical
boundaries
of
this
district
and
association
have
remained
the
same,
the
number
of
people
living
in
those
boundaries
has
increased
so
that
the
number
of
landowners
entitled
to
use
the
water
stored
and
developed
by
the
project,
as
well
as
the
number
of
electric
customers,
has
increased.
and
the
second
change
is
reflected
in
a
pair
of
statutory
amendments
in
1969
and
1974,
through
which
the
arizona
legislature
has
significantly
increased
the
extent
of
small
landowner
influence
in
the
election
to
board
of
directors.
the
1969
change
eliminated
the
formerly
existing
one
acre
limitation
as
a
condition
for
the
franchise,
and
the
1974
change
expanded
the
board
from
10
to
14
with
the
further
provision
that
those
four
additional
members
of
the
board
of
directors
would
be
elected
at
large,
on
a
one
landowner/one
vote
basis.
but
even
more
important
than
how
the
district
has
changed
is
how
it
has
not
changed.
it
still
serves
raw
water
to
the
same
lands,
the
number
of
persons
benefitted
has
changed
but
its
purpose
and
function
have
not.
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
held
and
the
parties
to
this
case
have
stipulated
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
salt
river
project
is
today
and
always
has
been,
the
storage,
development
and
delivery
of
raw
water
for
the
benefit
of
those
landowners
who
were
willing
to
risk
their
property
in
order
to
bring
it
into
existence.
now
the
appellees
take
a
different
view
of
the
significance
of
these
changes
in
the
number
of
people
served
by
the
project.
they
contend
that
the
significance
of
this
increase
in
population
is
that
the
district
has
effectively
been
converted
into
the
equivalent
of
a
city.
and
they
refer,
for
example,
to
the
district's
city
like
status
and
have
asserted
that
it
has
all
the
attributes
of
sovereignty.
two
comments
with
respect
to
this
view
are
appropriate.
the
first
is
that
this
view
is
absolutely
essential
to
their
position.
the
second
is
that
it
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
controlling
holdings
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
because
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
ruled,
and
i'm
quoting,
"that
the
district's
function
is
purely
business
and
economic
and
not
political
and
governmental,
and
that
it's
limited
governmental
attributes
have
been
conferred
for
the
purpose
of
better
enabling
it
to
function
and
accomplish
the
business
and
economic
purpose
for
which
it
was
organized.
"
the
significant
point
is
that
this
pivotal
issue
is
an
issue
of
arizona
law,
out
of
the
entire
panoply
of
governmental
powers
and
governmental
functions
that
any
entity
might
have,
the
issue
is
how
many
are
enjoyed
by
this
creature
of
arizona
law,
this
agricultural
improvement
district.
and
the
answer
has
been
supplied
by
the
arizona
supreme
court;
only
those
incidents
of
public
ness,
of
governmentalness,
that
are
absolutely
essential
in
order
to
enable
the
district
to
perform
its
proprietary
business
economic
activities.
what
this
case
really
involves
is
state
encouragement
of
private
investment
in
water
reclamation.
which,
i
submit,
is
a
most
appropriate
endeavor
for
an
arid
state
like
arizona.
but
it's
our
position
that
there's
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
that
says
that
arizona
can't
do
that.
and
we
also
believe
that
that
is
the
thrust
of
this
court's
decision
in
salyer
v.
tulare
lake
basin
water
storage
district.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
cannot
encourage
private
investment
in
water
reclamation.
in
other
words,
arizona
has
an
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
water
reclamation
be
carried
out.
and
what
it
has
done
through
these
statutes
is
to
encourage
private
investment
in
that
water
reclamation
by
assuring
that
those
who
make
the
investment
will
be
entitled
to
keep
the
fruits
of
their
investment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
by
making
it
a
governmental...
well,
it
makes
it
a
governmental
entity
for
the
purpose
of
making
its...
for
very
limited
purposes...
and
the
very
limited
purpose,
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
said,
is
in
order
to
allow
it
to
carry
out
its
economic
objectives.
now,
its
economic
objectives
are
to
permit
it
to
generate
some
income
which
in
turn
can
be
used
for
reclamation
purposes,
in
order
to
conserve,
store
and
deliver
water.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
by
virtue
of
arizona
statutes,
justice
stewart,
ars,
section
121111,
virtually
any
entity
in
the
state
of
arizona
has
the
power
to
condemn.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
does
have
the
power
to
review
and
revise
those
rates.
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
in
other
ways,
but
our
position
on
that
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution,
again,
that
says
that
the
state
must
set
the
rates
for
any
entity
that
performs
a
public
function,
a
public
type
function,
a
public
service
function,
such
as
electricity.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
some
question
about
that,
justice
powell.
it
is
possible
that
it
might
take
a
constitutional
amendment
which
would
involve
state
legislation
followed
by
a
vote
of
the
people.
but
the
most
important
point
is
the
one
to
which
you
allude.
and
that
is,
that
the
state
legislature
has
a
very
active
interest
in
the
activities
of
this
district
precisely
because
its
numbers
are
large.
seventeen
of
the
30
districts,
of
the
30
legislative
districts
in
the
state
of
arizona,
are
located
either
in
whole
or
in
part,
8
in
whole,
and
9
in
part,
within
the
physical
confines
of
the
salt
river
project.
fifteen
times
in
the
last
17
years,
the
statutes
dealing
with
this
district
have
been
changed
by
the
arizona
legislature.
the
results
have
not
been
to
gouge
the
electric
customers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
power
plant
siting,
for
example,
is
subject
to
regulation;
its
bonds
are
subject
to
periodic
review,
it
is
subject
to
the
public
utilities
regulatory
policies
act,
which
is
a
federal
act--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--by
the
arizona
corporation
commission
which
is
the
same
entity
which
sets
the
rates
for
private
corporations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
statute
doesn't
specify,
in
fact,
it
has
been
matters
related
to
the
bonds
that
have
been
reviewed
by
the
arizona
corporation
commission.
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
real
significance
of
this
change
in
increase
in
population
is
what
justice
powell,
your
opinion
for
the
court
said
in
san
antonio
school
district
v....
the
closing
line,
in
the
rodriguez
case,
is
that
these
are
the
kinds
of
matters
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
legislature
and
to
the
democratic
pressures
of
those
who
elect
them.
because
it's
an
easy
enough
matter
to
change
whether
through
statute
or
through
constitutional
amendment,
and
constitutional
amendment
in
arizona
is
not
the
impediment
that
it
is
in
the...
of
the
united
states
constitution--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
proposed
by
the
legislature,
but
voted
on
by
the
people
at
the
following
election.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
a
simply
majority,
in
both
instances,
or
it
can
be
done
by
initiative.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
certainly,
justice
marshall,
not
the
task
that
it
has
been
to
amend
the
united
states...
to
amend
the
united
states
constitution.
but
the
mechanism
is
there,
and
as
this
entity
becomes
more
and
more
open
eyed,
so
also
do
the
democratic
pressures
of
those
who
elect
the
elected
legislators
increase.
and
the
other
point
to
make
is
that
over
the
years,
though
the
rates
have
not
been
subject
to
regulation
by
the
corporation
commission,
neither
have
they
been
excessive.
they
have
always
been
comparable
to
the
rates
set
by
arizona
public
service,
which
is
the
other
public
utility
operating
within
the
same
general
area.
and
there
is
nothing
that
says
regulation
is
expensive
and
it's...
it
takes
time.
there
is
nothing
in
the...
munn
v.
illinois
said
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
entities
affected
by
the
public
interest
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
munn
v.
illinois
nor
any
other
case
has
said
that
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
impose
such
regulation.
and
if
the
state
wants
to
say,
all
right,
we're
going
to
have
one
entity
whose
rates
are
set
and
another
entity
whose
rates
are
not.
and
then
we're
going
to
monitor
it
and
see
if
there
are
any
abuses.
and
it
observes
that
over
a
period
of
40
or
50
years
there
have
not
been
abuses,
then
there
is
no
reason
for
judicial
management,
judicial
regulation,
under
the
aegis
of
constitutional
adjudication,
to
upset
that
kind
of
arrangement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
supreme
court
has
said
only
those
that
are
absolutely
necessary
to
enable
it
to
carry
out
its
business
purpose.
it
is,
it
has
the
power
to
tax
but
has
never
exercised
it,
and
it
never
would
because
it
is
contractually
obligated
to
ask
the
association
to
impose
its
acreage
assessment
power
instead
of
the
taxing
power.
its
bonds
are
tax
exempt.
and
that's
about
it.
now
it's
true
that
it
has
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
but
so
does
arizona
public
service
and
so
does
sears,
as...
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
arizona.
and
that
brings
us
back
to
this
question
of
the
governmental
function
and
governmental...
because
it's
limited...
governmental
purpose,
the
first
test,
under
salyer.
it
really
gets
much
closer,
indeed
we
say
that
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
salyer,
because
the
only
differences
between
this
case
and
salyer
are
in
the
increased
numbers
of
people.
and
the
only
significance
in
the
increased
numbers
of
people
are
simply
that
the
ability
of
the
people
to
get
their
views
effected
by
the
legislature
in
the
event
that
the
views
are
really
different
from
those
of
the
management
of
the
district,
are
much
more
effective,
simply
because
the
numbers
are
larger.
in
salyer,
you
had
one
corporation
that
had
a
virtual
hammerlock
over
the
entire
corporation;
an
election
wasn't
even
held
for
23
years.
by
contrast,
the
people
who
live
within
this
district
really
control
the
legislature,
and
if
they
want
changes
they
can
have
them
made.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
it
did
not
involve...
they
had
the
power
to
do
it
but
they
did
not
do
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
in
our
view,
the
only
significance
there
is
simply
that
that's
the
way
that
they
make
the
money
that
makes
the
reclamation--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
are
over
300,000;
there
are
about
320,000,
i
believe.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
how
many
voters?
the
technical
answer
to
that
is
around
210,
around
220
thousand,
in
the
sense
of
acres
that
are
voted.
now
some
of
those
are
broken
down
into
portions
of
acres
so
that
people
may...
may
vote
fractions
of
acres.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
it
would
be
more
than--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
i
do
know
that.
but
it
was
a
fairly
small
fraction
of
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
the
total
eligible--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
the
total
eligible
voters.
it
was
on
the
order
of
somewhere
around
10
or
20
thousand,
10
or
20
thousand
people.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
can't.
they
simply
held
that
this
scheme
was
unconstitutional.
and--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
think
i
can
answer
that.
his
brief
says,
and
we
agree
in
this
respect,
that
in
the
event
that
the
ninth
circuit
were
to
be
affirmed,
we
think
that
it
ought
to
go
back
to
the
arizona
legislature.
but
that,
in
itself,
demonstrates
why
it
ought
not
be
affirmed,
because
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
already
made
its
judgment
as
to
what
the
answer
ought
to
be
in
this
case.
and
these
matters,
the
issues
that
are
involved
here
in
this
case,
are
really
fundamentally
economic,
and
resource
allocation
issues.
they
are
issues
like
how
extensively
should
the
state
permit
nuclear
fossil
fuel
generation.
how
heavily
should
the
states
be
involved
in
flood
control
and
should
any
flood
control
responsibility
be
vested
in
a
project
whose
mission
is
to
conserve
water
rather
than
to
get
rid
of
it?
those
are
the
kinds
of
decisions--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
but
about
15
percent,
justice
stevens.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
case
is
similar
in
this
respect
to
the
san
antonio
school
district
case
where
the
majority
of
this
court
pointed
out
that
what
was
really
involved
in
that
case
more
basically
than
equal
protection,
were
matters
of
fiscal
and
economic
policy,
which
lie
within
the
responsibility
and
the
expertise
of
state
legislatures
rather
than
this
court.
and
the
same
is
true
here,
as
is
very
apparent
from
the
amici
brief.
this
fight
is
really
over
electric
rates,
flood
control
and
nuclear
and
fossil
fuel
generation.
and
those
are
matters
that
lie
within
the
prerogative
ultimately
of
the
arizona
legislature
and
if
there
are
changes
that
need
to
be
made
in
that
respect,
the
changes
can
be
made.
and
that...
excuse
me--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
i
think
that
would
lie
within
their
police
powers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
not
sure,
justice
brennan.
i've
thought
about
that
one;
it
does
raise
serious
constitutional
questions.
fortunately,
it's
an
issue
that
this
court
need
not
reach
in
this
case.
because
the
court
has
held
in
the
united
states
v.
vuitch
and
many
others,
that
in
those
kinds
of
cases
you
will
decide
in
such
ways
as
to
avoid
constitutional
issues
of
that
type,
rather
than
to
raise
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i've
been
searching
for
the
theory
of
the
violation
in
this
case
for
some
time,
justice
stevens,
and
i
hope
that
mr.
meyerson
will
respond
to
that.
he's
the
plaintiff
here
and
that's
his
burden.
our
contention
is
that
they
are
being
treated
with
respect
to
any
relevant
interest
that
you
can
identify,
there
is
no
difference
in
treatment
between
electric
customers...
and
that's
the
only
status
in
which
they
appear...
and
the
customers
of
arizona
public
service.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
objection
to
fossil
fuel
and
nuclear
generation,
there
is
the
same
objection
that
can
be
raised
by
arizona
public
service
customers.
to
the
extent
that
its
electric
rates,
those
electric
rates
are
identical
with
the
ones
that
are
being
charged
by
arizona
public
service
customers.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
think
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
exactly
what
the
plaintiffs
are
saying,
as
i
understand
them,
that
because
of
the
changes
in
size
that
the
district
has
taken
on
a
different
kind
of
function
that
has
made
it
something
like
a
city.
and
for
that
reason,
we
treat
it
like
a
city,
unlike
the
situation
in
salyer--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
it
said
is,
that
these
functions
have
acquired
an
independent
significance
of
their
own,
and
i
have
to
read
it...
i
have
to
read
that
into
that...
i
am
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
yes
sir.
and
i
say
that
that
is
inadequate
for
this
reason:
that
if
you
look
at
the...
the
decisions
of
this
court,
starting
from
the
state
legislature
end
of
the
spectrum,
it
has
come
as
far
down
into
the
total
complex
of
state
and
local
governmental
entities
as
the
general
governing
body
of
a
county
in
avery,
of
cities
and
school
boards.
starting
from
the
other
end,
those
entities
as
to
which
the...
which
this
court
will
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment,
it
has
come
as
far
as
water
conservation
districts.
now
the
one
distinction,
the
thing
that
distinguishes
the
school
boards
in
that
respect
is
that
this
is...
that
is
the
only
instance
in
which
this
court
has
applied
the
reynolds
v.
sims
rationale,
to
an
entity
that
does
not
exercise
general
governmental
power,
that
is,
such
as
a
city
or
a
county
that
has
general
power
over
an
entire
geographic
area.
the
reason
that
school
boards
are
distinctive
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
function
that
they
perform.
this
court
said
in
brown
v.
board
of
education,
and
later
in
rodriguez,
that
today
education
is
possibly
the
most
important
function
of
state
and
local
government.
and
so
the
inquiry
is,
how
central
to
the
operation
of
government
qua
government
is
the
function?
this
court
has
held
in
hadley
that
education
is
such
a
function,
but
is
squarely
held,
if
you
look
at
the
function
in
the
salyer
case
and
in
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison,
that
neither
water
conservation
nor
electricity
is
such
a
function.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
there
were
no
lien
on
their
property.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i'm
not
certain.
my
opponent
has
asserted
that.
it
is
true
that
for
the
past
5
years
no
general
obligation
bonds
have
been
issued,
but
i
am
advised...
you
see,
revenue
bonds
can
be
used
only
for
the
electric
service
side,
and
there
have
been
rather
severe
flood
damages
to
the
dams
and
to
the
water
service
side,
and
it's
possible
that
the
general
obligation
bonds
may
have
to
be
issued
again.
of
course,
that's
not--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course
not.
of
course
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
possibly
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
concurrent
with
what
the
state
supreme
court
has
said
and
i
believe
that
it's
in
conflict
with
the
thrust
of
what
this
court
necessarily
held
in
salyer;
that
you
look
to
function...
and
that
water
conservation...
we're
not
engaged
in
flood
control,
the
only
reason
that
we're
engaged
in
electric
service
is
just
to
make
more
effective
the
flood
control
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
also
held
that...
and--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--indeed,
this
court
held
squarely
the
contrary
in
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
justice
brennan.
thank
you
very
much.
it
would
be
difficult,
quite
frankly,
even
to
hypothesize
an
entity
in
which
landowners
as
a
group
are
more
disproportionately
affected
than
are
the
owners
of
this
district--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
the
total
obligations,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
general
obligations,--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
don't
know.
i
doubt--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
there
would
not
be.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
those
general
obligation
bonds
are
pretty
secure
and
i
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
default
in,
virtually
in
any...
because
the
lands
are
very
secure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
they
stand
in
first
place.
the
disproportionate
effect
comes
from
two
facts:
the
first
is,
the
stipulated
fact
that
the
value,
the
assessed
value
of
agricultural
lands
within
the
salt
river
project
in
the
district
and
the
association
are
generally
twice
the
value
of
comparable,
otherwise
comparable
lands
outside
the
district.
and
there
is
no
question
why.
that's
also
been
stipulated.
it's
because
of
the
water
conservation
activity
that
has
been
carried
out
by
this
district.
but
second,
and
from
a
broader
perspective,
this
district
is
owned
by
the
landholders.
they
brought
it
into
existence,
they
nursed
it
through
some
very
hard
times,
where
not
only
the
security
of
their
lands
but
also
acreage
assessments
were
necessary
to
keep
it
going.
the
mistaken
premise
of
the
appellees
and
the
amici
in
this
respect,
is
significant
but
nevertheless
mistaken.
the
amici
assert
that
the
district
already
belongs
to
private
owners,
or
to
the
public.
it
does
not
belong
to
private
owners.
that
is
directly
counter
to
the
holding
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
which
has
said
the
public
does
not
own
the
district,
instead,
the
owners--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
the
same
as
are
many
industrial
entities
within
the
state
of
arizona,
through
these
industrial
revenue
bonds.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do,
just
a
couple
of
brief
matters,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
with
respect
to
the
financial
stake,
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
meyerson
is
wrong.
paragraph
11
of
the
stipulation
specifies
that
the
association
has
levied
and
collected
assessments
upon
the
lands
and
that
hasn't
been
done
for
some
time.
there
is
an
annual
assessment
that
comes
each
year,
but
in
addition...
there
have
been
these
special
assessments
to
which
paragraph
11
of
the
stipulation
refers.
but
even
more
important,
from
the
beginning
it
was
these
people,
because
of
taking,
they
were
the
ones
who
submitted
their
lands
and
they
did
not
have
to
submit
them,
it
was
a
voluntary
matter.
and
some
of
the
lands
were
excluded
because
the
residents
of
tempe,
for
example,
elected
not
to
submit
their
lands.
now
with
regard
to
the
interchange
between
justice
white
and
mr.
meyerson
concerning
the
fact
that
the
fundamental
complaint
is
the
large
landowners
can
run
the
district.
i'd
like
to
clarify
just
exactly
to
what
extent
the
large
landowners
do
have
control
of
this
district
at
the
present
time.
mr.
meyerson
has
informed
the
court,
outside
of
the
record
but
i
have
no
objection
because
it
was
correct
information,
that
today
a
majority
of
the
lands
within
the
salt
river
project
are
urban.
it's
about
55
percent.
but
the
consequence
of
that
shift
has
been
that
out
of
the
14
members
of
the
board
of
directors,
ten
of
them
are
elected
by
constituencies
that
are
also
dominantly
urban.
and
that
includes
the
four
members
elected
at
large
and
includes
six
of
those
elected
from
districts.
and
with
regard
to
the
question,
justice
stevens,
has
there
ever
been
a
contest...
in
the
last
election,
there
was
a
lawyer
who
beat
out
a
landowner
in
one
of
these
at
large
districts.
now
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
the
fairness
of
the
polling
procedures
and
mr.
meyerson's
assertion--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
he
would
have
been...
not
necessarily.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
happen
to
know
him
and
he
is.
with
regard
to
the
difficulty
of
finding
these
polling
places,
they
are
the
regular
precinct
polling
places,
notice
is
given
of
these
elections
through
bill
stuffers,
through
newspaper
ads
and
through
news
releases,
and
the
entire
procedure
was
submitted
to
the
justice
department,
which
determined
that
we
complied
with
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
as
amended,
in
1970.
now
finally,
it
simply...
this
court
simply
has
never
held
that
every
public
entity
which
bears
the
municipal
label
is
therefore
precluded
from
obtaining
some
other
benefit,
some
other
objective,
by
encouraging
private
investment
in
some
private
kind
of
activity
which
has
an
incidental
benefit
to
the
government
and
permitting
those
who
make
the
investment
to
keep
the
benefits
and
to
run
the
project.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
holding
in
salyer,
and
indeed
an
alternative
ground
for
the
holding
in
toltec,
the
companion
case
was,
that
to
whatever
extent
there
are
inequities
that
can
be
cured
by
the
wyoming
legislature
which
is
fairly
elected
on
a
one
person
one
vote
basis,
now
what
we
have
overall
in
this
case
is
this
circumstance.
that
over
2/3
of
a
century
ago
these
people
put
up
their
property,
lands
and
money
to
bring
this
project
into
existence.
they
were
assured
that
if
they
did
so
they
could
operate
it
their
way,
so
long
as
they
fulfilled
the
basic
requirements
of
the
law
including
equal
protection
of
the
law.
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
with
a
system
that
has
been
so
favorable
to
the
landowners
and
to
the
state
of
arizona,
because
of
the
water
benefits
that
have
come
to
the
state
of
arizona,
why
is
it
that
all
of
this,
that
these
circumstances
have
to
be
upset
and
why
is
it
that
the
differences
to
the
extent
they
exist,
amount
to
a
constitutional
difference.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
