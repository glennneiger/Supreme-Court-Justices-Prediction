rehnquist
then
mr.
lee,
what
kind
of
governmental
powers
does
the
project
exercise
now?
justice
rehnquist
well
mr.
meyerson,
what
if
the
district
did
not
generate
electricity,
but
simply
engaged
in
flood
control
activities
under
authorization
from
the
arizona
legislature
and
the...
it
could
levy
unpaid
assessments
for
that
purpose.
would
you
say
it
was
still
governed
by
the
one
man
one
vote
principle?
justice
rehnquist
how
many
people
were
involved
in
salyer?
justice
rehnquist
what
would
you
say
about
a
drainage
district
in
florida
that's
purpose
was
to
drain
the
land
rather
than
to
bring
water
to
it?
it
would
generate
no
electricity.
justice
rehnquist
well
doesn't
the
district
notify
the
members
of
when
and
where
the
election
is
going
to
be
held?
justice
rehnquist
but
don't
you
say
the
tendency
is
in
the
opposite
direction,...
more
and
more
subdivisions
so
that
there
will
be
more
and
more
one
acre
votes
and
less
and
less
large
landowner
votes.
justice
rehnquist
--well
what
in
the
arizona
legislature
decided
that
the
governor
should
appoint
all
of
the
judges
who
are
certainly
public
decision
makers
and
that
the
people
should
have
no
say
other
than
in
the
election
of
the
governor
as
to
how
the
judges
were
chosen,
would
that
violate
the
one
man
one
vote
principle?
justice
rehnquist
well
if
it's
public,
they
certainly
are
engaged
in
public
decision
making.
