mr.
lee,
i
think
you
said
earlier
that
whether
or
not
it
may
regulate
rates,
there
are
other
respects
in
which
the
state
may
regulate--
justice
jr.
--bonds
are
subject
to
periodic
review
in
what
sense?
justice
jr.
is
that
the
issuance
or
terms
or
what?
justice
jr.
but
you're
not
saying,
i
gather,
mr.
lee,
that
the
arizona
legislature
could
transfer
the
voting
power
from
the
landowners
to
the
electrical
consumers
are
you?
justice
jr.
--before
you
get
into
it,
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
justice
jr.
i
gather
there's
about
two
billion
dollars
of
these
general...
bonds--
justice
jr.
--yes.
and
it's
only
about
240
million,
i
understand--
justice
jr.
--well,
now,
may
there
be
a
default
merely
by
a
change
in
the
voting
constituency?
justice
jr.
i
mean,
is
there
a
covenant
in
the
bonds
which
a
default--
justice
jr.
--well,
and
i
gather
there
are
covenants
which
require
the
proceeds
of
the
electrical
service
to
be
applied
in
the
payment
of
the
general
obligation.
now
can
they...
when
can
you
ever
get
to
a
default
that
means
that
the
lien
on
the--
justice
jr.
--which
would
trigger
any
lien
on
the
land?
justice
jr.
well
isn't
there
another
relevant,
mr.
meyerson,
in
your...
in
your
submission,
and
that
is
that
the
state
has
set
up
a
method
of
election
for
the
people
who
are
going
to
run
the
public
entity?
justice
jr.
and
you
say
that
when
that's
done,
it's
got
to
be
on
a
one
man
one
vote
basis?
justice
jr.
unless
it
falls
within
the
salyer
exception?
justice
jr.
but
it's
very
important,
is
it
not,
to
your
submission,
that
the
state
has
set
up
a
system
of
election?
justice
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
meyerson.
if...
i
gather
that
as
presently
constituted,
the
governing
body
now
allocates
money
to
water
irrigation
and
other
water
projects,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
some
of
that
money,
i
gather,
are
the
proceeds
of
electric
generation,
is
it
not?
justice
jr.
now
suppose
you
had
an
expanded
voting
scheme,
which,
as
you
suggest,
would
take
in
all
of
the
non
landowners
in
the
district,
could
they
then
take
that
money
now
used
on
irrigation
projects
and
lower
electric
utility
rates?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
could
it--
justice
jr.
--yes,
but
they
now
because
of
their
voting
power,
don't
they
now
control
the
allocation?
justice
jr.
they
do,
in
fact.
justice
jr.
and
if
they...
if
there
were
a
new
board
elected
by
a
district
wide
constituency,
i
take
it
they
would
say
well
we
won't
give
that
much
to
water
irrigation,
rather
we'll
reduce
electrical
rates.
justice
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
you
recognize
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the
second
element,
the
disproportionate
impact
element
of
salyer,
whether
or
not
that
is
satisfied.
justice
jr.
--do
they
vote
at
regular
polling
places?
justice
jr.
how
many
are
they,
do
you
know,
mr.
meyerson?
justice
jr.
how
many
are
non
property
owners...
what
percentage
are
non
property
owners,
do
we
know?
justice
jr.
who
are
renters?
