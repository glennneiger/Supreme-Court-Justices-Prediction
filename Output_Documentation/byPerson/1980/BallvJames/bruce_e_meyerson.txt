mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
principal
issues
raised
by
the
appellants.
first,
whether
the
district
is
so
like
a
business
that
traditional
constitutional
principles
should
not
apply.
secondly,
whether
an
economic
subsidy
to
district
landowners
is
a
constitutionally
sufficient
reason
to
warrant
acreage
voting.
our
remarks
will
address
these
points.
preliminarily,
it
should
be
emphasized
that
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
the
most
narrow
of
exceptions
to
this
court's
consistent
ruling
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
presumption
is
always
in
favor
of
equal
access
to
the
ballot.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well
this
of
course
is
an
entity
of
government,
because
it
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
arizona,
your
honor.
i
think
the
question
really
becomes
is
it
so
like
a
business
that--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--no,
justice
stewart,
i
think
the
rationale
of
salyer
was
the
court
accepted
the
fact
that
there
was
state
action
because
there
was
a
political
subdivision--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well
if
the
court--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--i
think
the
court
first
concluded
that
because
no
general
public
services
were
provided
and
because
there
was
a
disproportionate
effect
on
landowners--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--a
rational
basis
test
should
be
used
to
evaluate
the
acreage
voting
system,
rather
than
the
compelling
interest
standard.
so
i
think
salyer
stands
for
the
principle
that
the
argument
that
the
district
here
is
much
like
the
business
and
therefore
no
principle
of
constitutional
laws
should
be
applied
is
incorrect.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
an
equal
protection
analysis
regardless,
we
suggest
that
it
is
the
compelling
interest
analysis
because
we
don't
believe
that
by
applying
the
standard
of
the
salyer
case,
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
result
in
salyer
would
apply
here.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
rehnquist,
i
would,
because
we're
not
in
1903
and
we're
not
in
1937;
this
is
1981,
where
the
arizona
legislature
has
recognized
that
ground
water
depletion
is
a
state
wide
and
local
crisis
in
the
phoenix
area
where
there
are
flood
control
problems,
where
this
is
the
district
that
controls
the
water
supplies
for
a
metropolitan
area
of
1.5
million
people.
this
is
not
like
the
salyer
case
where
the
district
there
only
supplied
water
for
agriculture.
now
in
phoenix,
the
metropolitan
cities
there
receive
60
percent
of
their
water
from
the
salt
river
project.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
there
were
only
77
people
involved,
justice
marshall,
in
the
salyer
case.
so,
i
think
even
if
this
district
was
solely
restricted
to
water
delivery
activities,
the
changed
circumstances
require
a
different
result
today
than
had
this
suit
been
brought
in
1903
or
1937,
because--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--the
class
of...
justice
stewart,
the
class
of
residents
of
the
district
who
own
no
property
or
only
own
fractional
acres
of
property.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
that
could
well
be
the
ultimate
outcome,
but--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--it
must
be,
except
the
arizona
legislature
would
have
discretion,
perhaps,
to
adopt
an
appointed
board.
that
in
fact,
has
already
been
discussed
and
debated
by
some
of
the
legislators
in
arizona,
so
that
could
be
an
outcome.
but
if
some
type
of
voting
structure
is
ultimately
established--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--i
think
this
court
has
held
that
when
the
state
adopts
an
appointive
system
of
government
within
the
general
terms,
the
states
are
free
to
do
what
they
will--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--that
would
be
a
realm
of
discretion
left
to
the
legislature.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
well,
i
hope
that
would
not
happen.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
when
the
state
delegates
the
electoral
process,
that
raises
different
constitutional
considerations
and
that's
what
the
state
of
arizona
has
done
here.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
well...
i
think
that
this
court--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well
the
state
constitutionally
can
appoint
a
dentist
to
the
dental
board,
it
can
appoint
a
cosmetologist
to
the
cosmetology
board;
when
we
are
engaged
in
the
appointive
process
there
is
more
lee
way
given
to
the
state
than
we
are...
then
we
have
in
the
electoral
process.
i
think
the
opinions
of
this
court
are
quite
clear,
that
when
the
state
decides
that
a
matter
is
so
important
to
submit
a
vote
to
the
people
that
that
raises
the
constitutional
concerns--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well
i
think
it
is
quite
different.
mr.
lee
says
that
the
state
of
arizona
should
be
free
to
make
decisions
with
respect
to
nuclear
power
generation,
water
allocation,
utility
rates.
well
of
course
the
state
should
be
free
to
do
that
because
the
state
legislature
is
elected
by
the
people
on
one
person
one
vote.
but
if
the
state
delegates
those
important
decisions
to
a
local
group,
it
then
must
provide
that
the
election
of
that
local
group
must
be
in
accordance
with
constitutional
principles.
so
i
think
there
is
a
difference
when
the
state
delegates
decision
making
authority
to
a
local
governmental
agency
and
provides
for
an
election
of
the
directors
of
that
local
governmental
agency.
and
i--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--no.
of
course,
justice
white,
there
are
many
important
activities
carried
on
by
cooperatives
and
private
businesses.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
white,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
think
that
in
arizona
is
an
essential
and
important
function,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
legally
determinative--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--the
legally
determinative
factors
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
are
that
this
is
a
political
subdivision
created
by
the
state
of
arizona,
and
that
it's
given
powers
and
authority
that
substantially
affect
people
in
important
ways,
by
providing
essential
electric
and
water
services.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
think
that's
a
major
distinction
in
the
american
system--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--that's
right,
justice
white--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--of
course.
that...
i
think
that's
what
this
court's
holding--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right,--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--that's
right.
if
it
does
not
fall
within
the
salyer
exception,
i
think
this
court's
holdings
are
clear.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that
is
critical
to
our
case;
that
the
state
has
adopted
an
election
process.
it
has
restricted
that
election
process
to
property
owners.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
this
court
has
given
some
higher
consideration
to
municipal
type
functions
such
as
electric
and
water
activities
in
the
cipriano
case,
because
there,
in
a
municipal
bond
election
this
court
held
that
you
could
not
restrict
voting
to
property
owners
because
the
activity
of
the
municipal
utility
affected
all
citizens.
whereas
in
the
salyer
case,
because
there
the
water
delivery
activities
had
its
effect
solely
upon
the
landowners
and
the
water
was
used
for
agricultural
purposes
only,
this
court
permitted
the
acreage
voting
system.
so
i
think
this
court
has
given
a
higher
use
or
more
important
use,
if
you
will,
to
water
uses
that
affect
residents
in
their
capacity
as
citizens
as
opposed
to
farmers.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
if
all
the
district
water
was
used
solely
for
agricultural
purposes,
that
would
have
an
effect
on
the
merits
of
our
case.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
don't
think
it
would
have
the
effect
that
it
would
result...
that
it
would
change
the
outcome,
your
honor,
because
here
the
district
finances
all
of
its
activities
primarily
through
electric
sales,
and
the
electric
activities
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
entire
lifestyle
and
economic
livelihood
of
the
phoenix
metropolitan
area.
now
i'd
like
to
address
one
other--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
chief
justice
burger,
at
all.
what
i
am
suggesting,
when
it
is
taken
on
by
a
governmental
entity
such
as,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
cipriano
decision,
then
this
court
has
said
because
the
provision
of
electric
service
is
an
essential
function
that
affects
all
citizens,
it
is
impermissible
to
exclude
non
property
owners
from
voting.
so
i
think
the
important
distinction
is
whether
the
activity
is
carried
out
by
government
or
not,
and
here
it
is
carried
out
by
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
we'd
have
to
examine
whether
or
not
those
drainage
activities
had
the
type
of
far
reaching
effect
that
that
this
court
singled
out
in
salyer,
that
is,
whether
it
would
be
a
general
public
service
and
perhaps
it
would
not
be
in
your
example...
but
then
we'd
have
to
look
at
whether
its
activities
disproportionately
affected
the
landowners
as
a
class.
and
if
we
found
that
there
was
that
disproportionate
effect,
i
think
we
would
conclude
then
that
the
one
person
one
vote
standard
wouldn't
apply.
i'd
like
to
address
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
really
a
business
or
whether
it's
a
political
subdivision,
and
specifically
talk
about
these
decisions
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
now
in
arizona,
the
delivery
of
water
service
by
a
municipality
is
called
a
proprietary
function.
now
that
wouldn't
make
it
any
different,
i
don't
think,
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
a
city
could
not
restrict
voting
in
a
bond
election
to
improve
the
water
system
to
property
owners
simply
because
the
arizona
supreme
court
says
that
it's
a
proprietary
function.
time
after
time,
in
these
voting
cases,
this
court
has
said
it
will
not
be
bound
by
state
law
characterizations
and
descriptions
of
what
local
governments
are.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right,
justice
stewart.
the
cases
are
entirely
different
fact
situations,
whether
or
not
the
district
is
authorized--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--it's
a
different
context.
and
i
think
this
court
has
to
be
bound
by
what
the
district's
enabling
act
says
about
it
and
that's
a.r.s.
45-902.
an
agricultural
improvement
district
is
a
public
political
taxing
subdivision
of
the
state,
and
a
municipal
corporation,
to
the
extent
of
the
powers
and
privileges
granted
by
this
chapter
or
granted
generally,
to
municipal
corporations
by
the
constitutions
and
statutes
of
this
state.
now
that
is
what
an
agricultural
improvement
district
is,
under
arizona
law.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
it
is
an
acreage
tax,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right.
there
has
been
much
implication
that
there
is
some
investment
in
this
district,
that
there
are
people
who
put
up
money,
90
or
80
years
ago
and
they
should
be
entitled
to
their
rewards.
that
is
a
factual
error
and
i
hope
the
court
will
pay
close
attention
to
the
stipulation
of
facts
and
exhibits
because
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
anyone
put
up
equity
capital
to
support
the
original
development
of
this
reclamation
project.
i
hope
the
court
will
also
look
at
the
latest
annual
report
which
is
filed
with
the
clerk's
office
and
examine
the
balance
sheet
of
this
district.
there's
no
shareholder
equity
in
the
salt
river
project.
there's
no
capital
that's
been
invested
here.
the
only
item
on
the
liability
side
of
the
balance
sheet
is
debt,
and
that
debt
is
90
percent
revenue
bonds,
which
are
secured
by
the
electric
revenues.
there
is
no
financial
stake
that
the
appellants
have
in
this
district
whatsoever.
even
going
back
to
1903,
the
appellants'
predecessors
did
not
put
up
any
money,
it
was
the
united
states
that
put
up
the
money
in
the
form
of
loans
to
build
the
theodore
roosevelt
dam
and
the
granite
reef
diversion
dam.
and
they
paid
back
those
loans
and
they
didn't
pay
any
interest.
and
that's
the
way
the
salt
river
valley
water
users
association
was
financed
originally.
there
is
no
shareholder
equity.
when
we
talk
about
the
shareholders
here,
every
landowner
within
the
salt
river
project
district
that
stretches
across
the
whole
phoenix
metropolitan
area,
got
one
share
per
one
acre
of
land.
you
got
a
share
whether
you
wanted
one
or
not.
if
you
owned
a
piece
of
land
you
got
one
vote.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right,
justice
brennan.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
today's...
day
of
inflation,
lower
rates
are
probably
not
in
the
horizon,
but--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--it
could,
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
in
paragraph
60
of
the
stipulation
of
facts
we
agreed
that
the
precise
amount
of
the
subsidy
is
not
fixed.
in
other
words,
the
present
landowners
or
water
users
are
not
entitled
to...
under
law...
any
particular
level
of
subsidy.
the
parties
still--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--that's
right,
they--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--and
they
do
in
fact.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
they
might
do
that,
justice
brennan,
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
has
said,
time
after
time,
in
the
carrington
v.
rash
case,
and
in
the
evans
v.
cornman
case,
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
group
may
vote
the
way
the
people
who
are--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well
justice
brennan.
i
think
they've
turned
salyer
on
its
head
because
the
disproportionate
impact
there
was
and
it
has
always
been
in
the
dissenting
opinions
of
this
court,
who
is
paying
the
cost
of
government?
this
court
has
looked
at
whether
or
not
the
landowners
were
financing
the
district
in
salyer,
and
concluded
that
because
all
of
the
costs
assessed
against
the...
or,
the
district's
costs
were
assessed
against
the
land.
and
in
the
dissenting
opinions
of
this
court,
the
emphasis
has
always
been
to
look
at
who
is
paying
the
bill.
and
at
a
very
minimum,
this
court
has
said
those
people
at
least
have
to
vote.
what
the
appellants
have
now
done
is
turn
that
upside
down,
and
said
we're
getting
the
benefit,
because
it's
the
customers
and
everyone
else
that's
paying
the
bill
through
the
electric
rates
and
through
the
lien
on
the
land,
they
are
now
saying
that
just...
that
acreage
voting
is
justified
because
they
get
a
small
economic
benefit.
and
i
think
we
would
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
out
of
a
three
billion
dollar
utility
in
a
political
subdivision
that
has
500
million
dollars
in
revenues
a
year,
that
a
ten
million
dollar
subsidy
is
no
reason
to
continue
to
restrict
voting
in
this
vital
organization
to
landowners
and
by
the
way,
that
means
very
large
landowners.
now,
mr.
lee
was
in
error
when
he
told
you
that
200,000
people
vote
in
these
elections,
or
that
200,000
people
can
vote
in
the
elections.
out
of
230,000
acres
of
land,
there
are
only
about
160,000
that
are
eligible
to
be
voted
because
the
corporate
owned
lands
can't
be
voted.
and
that's
an
important
distinction
in
the
salyer
decision,
where
justice
rehnquist
recognized
that
there
everybody
could
vote,
whether
they
were
individual
owners
or
corporate
owners
or
not.
but
in
the
stipulated
facts,
we
pointed
out
that
in
the
years
1970,
'72
and
'74,
only
about
400,
500
and
600
people
were
voting
and
they
were
voting
thousands
of
acres
of
land.
and
so
with
a
metropolitan
area
of
one
and
a
half
million
people,
you
have
literally
a
handful
of
people
who
have
controlled
this
important
institution.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
don't
believe
it
is,
justice
white
you
simply
have
to
be
a
qualified
elector
in
the
state
of
arizona--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--i
can
tell
you
very
quickly.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
in
1970,
621
voters
voted
19,000
acres;
1974,
900
voters
voted
43,000
acres...
that
was
1972,
excuse
me,
and
in
1974,
561
voters
voted
15,000
acres.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
they
are
not
regular
polling
places,
justice
brennan.
you
have
to
know
where
you're
going
if
you're
going
to
find
one,
believe
me.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right.
we
suggest--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--in
our
stipulation--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--in
our
stipulation,
there
were
359,000
property
owners
in
the
district.
now--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--who
would
be
eligible
to
vote,
but
of
course,
most
of
them
would
be
homeowners
who
would
be
voting
fractional
votes,
out
of
that...
we
are
never
able
to
identify
the
number
of
one
acre
votes
and
above...
but
those
359,000
i
would
suspect,
are
primarily
homeowners
who
are
the
people
who
own
one
quarter
and
one
eighth,
one
sixteenth
of
a
vote.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
rehnquist,
in
recent
years
they
have
placed
ads
in
the
paper
and
i
believe
bill
stuffers
go
out
in
the
electric
bills,
but
frankly
as
you
can
see
from
the
history
of
the
voting
pattern,
when
you
ask
people
to
vote
an
eighth
of
a
vote
or
a
sixteenth
of
a
vote,
that
is
so
antithetical
to
democratic
processes,
that
people
just
don't
go
out
and
do
that.
and
of
course,
it
would
take
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
memorandum,
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
board
members
who
owns
800
acres
of
land,
at
least
he
did
at
the
time
we
filed
the
action,
it
would
take
about
3500
homeowners
to
equal
his
vote,
3500
homeowners
would
have
to
go
to
the
polls
to
have
the
same
voting--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--i'm
sorry,
justice
white,
i
really
don't
know
that.
i
understand
that
in
a
number
of
the
subdivisions
of
the
district
and
there
are
ten
of
these
divisions,
that
theoretically
in
a
number
of
those,
if
all
the
homeowners
went
out
and
voted,
they
could
have
the
same
number
of
votes
as
the
large
landowners.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
justice
white,
i'm
afraid
that
what
has
happened
over
the
years
is
that
because
people
with
very
large
land
holding...
holdings
have
been
able
to
control
this
entity
by
casting
relatively
few
individual
votes;
that
has
so
discouraged--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well
now,
over
50
percent
of
the
land
is
urbanized.
i
frankly
don't
know
how
many
large
landowners
there
are.
i
suspect
as
we
go
on
into
the
21st
century
that
number
will
be
declining,
of
course.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
guess
theoretically
that
might
work.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
but,
that
hasn't
happened
and
that
isn't
the
case.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
it's
one
of
our
fundamental
practical
complaints;
it's
not
one
of
our
fundamental
legal
complaints.
as
a
practical
matter,
yes,
a
few
large
landowners
can
control
the
district
and
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
exhibits
which
are
attached
that
indicate
the
resumes
and
the
affiliations
of
the
district
board
members,
i
think
that
proves
our
point
that
that
has
happened.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
think
eventually
that
will
happen,
but
we'll
still
be
excluding
all
of
the
non
property
owners.
we
seem
to
have
forgotten
about
them
in
our
analysis
that
they
are
also
paying
the
bills,
paying
the
freight,
so
to
speak,
and
are
also
benefitting
from
the
availability
of
the
electric
system
and
the
water
delivery
system,
i
think
this
discussion
has
focussed
too
much
on
the
rights
and
roles
of
the
fractional
acre
owners.
i
think
that
we
don't
rest
our
case
on
an
argument
that
weighting
the
voting
system
is
wrong,
we
think
that's
offensive
to
the
constitution.
our
case
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
property
ownership
is
a
condition
at
all.
and
so
the
mere
fact
that
more
subdivisions,
or
more
homes,
are
built,
in
no
way
in
my
opinion,
undercuts
the
fundamental
constitutional
principle
that
we're
articulating
here,
and
that
is
that
non
property
owners
should
not
be
excluded.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--well,
justice
brennan,
we
don't
know
exactly,
but
we
do
know
that
this...
that
maricopa
county
has
over
1
and
1/2
million
people,
it's
the
largest
metropolitan
area
in
phoenix,
and
the
parties
stipulated
there
were
substantial
numbers
of
people
and
i
just
avow
to
you
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
out
in
phoenix--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
many
of
them
are
renters.
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
in
any
large
metropolitan
area
there
are
going
to
be
substantial
numbers
of
people
who
don't
own
property.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
yes,
it
does,
justice
stevens.
there
are
some
charts
that
indicate
in
1970,
'72
and
'74,
where
there
were
different
farmers
who
were
running
for
the
same
seats
on
the
board,
i
believe
there
were
a
few
contests
in
those
years.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
i
think
that
might
explain
it.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
before
i
summarize,
i'd
like
to
address
another
point
which
mr.
lee
made,
and
his
implication
that
this
case
is
really
an
attempt
to
undercut
or
change
a
policy
decision
of
the
arizona
legislature.
but
that
clearly
is
not
what
is
involved
here.
because
there
is
an
important
difference
between
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
a
substantive
piece
of
legislation
and
this
case
which
is
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
a
statute
which
restricts
voting.
this
is
not
an
action
which
challenges
a
substantive
policy.
the
arizona
legislature
can
and
should
be
free
to
make
substantive
policy
choices,
but
when
the
legislature
delegates
public
decision
making
to
a
unit
local
government
which
exercises
power
and
authority
on
matters
important
to
the
welfare
of
all
residents,
must
provide
for
a
system--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--justice
white,
i
don't
believe
it
assumes
that,
because
this
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
arizona.
it's
just
like
a
city,
it's
just
like
a
decision
in
the
cipriano
case
to
sell
municipal
bonds
to--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--that's
right.
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
here
turns
on
whether
the
court
finds
that
there's
a
governmental
function
involved.
i
don't
know--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--i
don't
believe
it
would,
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
that
in
arizona,
judicial
merit
selection
of
judges.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
but
there,
you're
hypothetical
assumes
that
the
governor
has
appointed
the
judge.
if
the
governor
were
to
appoint
the
board
of
the
salt
river
project
under
a
statute
adopted
by
the
arizona
legislature,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
but
that
is
not
what
the
arizona
legislature
has
done.
it
has
established
a
political
subdivision
and
it
has
said
that
the
directors
of
that
political
subdivision
will
be
elected,
and
once
we
enter
the
election
process
as
opposed
to
the
appointive
process,
i
believe
this
court's
opinions
are
very
clear
that
that
election
must
be
governed
by
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
limitations
of
the
constitution.
in
summary,
the
district
landowners
here
have
no
risk,
and
we
would
emphasize
again
that
every
time
this
court
has
evaluated
one
of
these
cases
it
has
looked
at
what
is
the
risk
borne
by
the
property
owners...
there
is
no
risk
here.
the
revenues
are
derived
from
the
sale
of
electricity,
the
bonds
are
secured
by
a
pledge
of
revenues,
there
is
no
economic
risk.
and
so
what
the
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
adopt
an
entire
new
standard
and
that
is
that
a
subsidized
group
is
entitled
to
exclusive
voting
control
of
government.
the
implications
of
that
new
standard
that
the
appellants
are
proposing
to
this
court
are
frightening.
are
welfare
recipients
to
be
the
only
voters
for
congressional
elections
because
they
are
the
primary
recipients
of
government
transfer
payments?
is
the
dairy
industry
to
vote
in
wisconsin
on
a
one
farm
one
vote
because
they
have
a
subsidy?
are
daycare
mothers
to
vote
only
in
arizona
because
the
legislature
just
appropriated
2
and
1/2
million
dollars
to
subsidize
daycare.
what
the
appellants
are
telling
you
is
that
they
are
entitled
to
exclusive
control
of
this
entity
because
they
get
a
subsidy.
they
haven't
put
up
any
money,
they
didn't
put
it
up
in
1903,
they
have
no
economic
risks
today
and
their
case
hinges
on
whether
this
court
concludes
that
a
subsidized
group
is
entitled
to
exclusive
control
of
such
an
important
entity.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
the
salt
river
project
district
board
does,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--they
don't
have
an
election.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
now,
mr.
lee
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
arizona
corporation
commission
approves
those
revenue
bond
sales,
and
that's
true.
my
experience,
and
i
have
been
a
participant
in
these
proceedings,
is
that
that
is
not
effective
regulation
at
all
because
once
the
district
board
makes
the
decision
to
build
the
plant,
it's
somewhat
academic
then
to
get
the
financing
to
build
it,
because
the
decision
has
already
been
made.
and
so
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
approval
to
sell
these
revenue
bonds
in
no
way
gives
us
any
greater
accountability.
finally--
mr.
bruce
e.
meyerson
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
