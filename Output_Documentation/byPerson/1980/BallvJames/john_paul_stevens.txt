justice
stevens
excuse
me.
before
you
leave
the
point,
you
said
there
were
about
300,000
customers.
how
many
of
those
lived
in
the
district?
justice
stevens
about
15
percent.
thank
you.
justice
stevens
i'm
a
little
puzzled,
frankly,
and
perhaps
i
have
the
same
difficulty
justice
white
does,
don't
we
necessarily
have
to
know
what
the
class
is
that's
entitled
to
equal
treatment?
this
is
an
equal
protection
case,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
some
way...
if
your
opponent
is
right,
all
members
of
whatever
class
it
is
are
entitled
to
equal
right
to
vote,
whether
they
are
all
consumers
or
all
residents
or
all
property
owners;
don't
we
have
to
know
what
the
theory
of
the
violation
is
and
won't
that
dictate
the
remedy?
justice
stevens
but
then,
mr.
meyerson,
why
does
the
case
have
to
go
back
to
the
state
legislature?
isn't
there
only
one
simple
remedy,
if
you
are
right?
all
residents
have
to
have
a
right
to
vote?
justice
stevens
not
could
well
be,
it
must
be.
justice
stevens
would
it
be
constitutional
for
the
government
to
appoint
a
committee
of
landowners
to
select
the
board
of
directors?
justice
stevens
and
the
governor
could
delegate
that
power
to
precisely
the
same
people
who
are
now
the
electors,
i
suppose?
justice
stevens
you'd
have
a
pyrrhic
victory
if
he
did
that.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
just
a
matter
of
labels?
you
call
it
the
electoral
process;
one
might
also
call
it
the
process
of
selecting
the
board
of
directors
of
this
entity.
justice
stevens
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you've
conceded
that
the
state
constitutionally
could
have
precisely
the
same
people
do
the
selecting.
justice
stevens
and
here,
arizona
has
decided
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
situation.
they
have
decided
for
a
special
method
of
electing
these
people.
i
don't
know
why
that's
any
different
than
saying
the
governor
can
do
the
same
thing,
and
constitutionally.
justice
stevens
does
the
district
have
the
power
to
impose
general
taxes
or
just
real
estate
taxes?
justice
stevens
so
it
would
have
to
be
in
acres?
justice
stevens
two
questions,
mr.
meyerson.
first,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there's
ever
been
an
election
contest?
justice
stevens
and
i
take
it
those
years
there
were
more
votes
than
the
ones--
justice
stevens
--yes.
