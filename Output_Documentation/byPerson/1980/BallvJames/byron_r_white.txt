justice
white
well
how
many,
do
you
know
how
many
votes...
you
must
know
how
many
votes
were
cast
in
the
last
election?
justice
white
total
number
of
people
entitled
to
vote?
justice
white
voters?
justice
white
could
you
tell
me
what
remedy
the
ninth
circuit
envisioned?
or
did
it
envision
any--
justice
white
--what
were...
well,
i
suppose
i
should
ask
your
colleague,
and
i
will...
what
remedy
he
had
in
mind?
justice
white
well
mr.
lee,
we
are
reviewing
a
judgment
for
the
ninth
circuit,
not
some
plaintiff's
views,
what
do
you
think
the
violation
was
the
ninth
circuit
found?
justice
white
how
did
it,
you
can
read
its
opinion.
what
do
you
think
it
said?
justice
white
well
wasn't
it
any
more
specific
than
that?
justice
white
what
functions?
supplying
power
and
developing
water?
justice
white
well
i
take
it
then,
your
argument
really
is
a
functional
one
and
you
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
landowners
have
special
burdens
to
any
great
extent?
justice
white
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
if
there
were
no
lien
on
their
property?
justice
white
which
there
won't
be
one
of
these
days,
right?
justice
white
i
would...
you
certainly
wouldn't
argue
that
the
development
of
water
or
flood
control
wouldn't
be
a
proper
governmental
function?
justice
white
and
perhaps
in
effect,
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
that
in
a
state
like
arizona
that
necessarily
is
a
governmental
operation
so
important
to
everyone
that
everybody...
ought
to
vote
on
it
or
something?
justice
white
well
certainly
no
one
suggests
that
power
generation
is...
exclusively
a
public
function?
justice
white
mr.
lee,
your
argument
so
far
is
that...
most
of
your
time
is
gone...
has
emphasized
the
limited
purpose
requirement
of
salyer.
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
disproportionate
effect--
justice
white
of
course,
the
district
is
permitted
to
exercise
one
of
their
prerogatives
of
the
sovereign,
namely,
to
have
its
obligations
be
tax
free?
justice
white
what
about
agricultural
cooperatives
that
are,
say,
furnishing
a
great
share
of
the
food
for
the
people
of
the
city
and...
they
have
elections,
they
run
their
own
business,
set
their
own
prices,...
a
rather
vital
function
to
be
furnishing
food,
people
have
to
eat.
would
you
say
those
elections
have
to
be
open
to
everybody
who
buys
food?
justice
white
well
isn't
it
your
theory
that...
and
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
furnishing,
the
development
of
water
and
its
control
is
so
important
that
it
should
be
considered
a
governmental
function?
justice
white
well
what's
your
position?
justice
white
what
is
it,
then?
justice
white
well
how
much
different
is
that
than
what
i
said,
except
for
the
fact
you've
added
that
it
is
a
public
entity?
justice
white
well...
so,
but
you
don't
say
every
public
entity
that's
doing
anything
is
subject
to
your
rule?
justice
white
so
it's
a
public
entity
that's
really
engaged
in
a
function
that
is
important
enough
to
all
the
people?
justice
white
so
you
wouldn't
be
taking
this
position
if
the
district
didn't
sell
water
to
the
city?
justice
white
well
does
it
affect...
how
much
of
an
effect?
justice
white
is
proxy
voting
permitted?
justice
white
do
you
know
if...
in
those
elections
where
you
say
400
to
600
people
did
the
voting,
how
many
acres
were
voted,
do
you
know?
justice
white
well,
if
it's
in
the
stipulation--
justice
white
and
so,
that's
just
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
eligible
acres?
justice
white
and
how
many...
do
you
know
how
many
eligible
people
there
are
to
vote?
justice
white
how
many
people
are
landowners?
justice
white
who
all...
who
would
be
eligible
to
vote?
justice
white
do
you
know
how
many
landowners
there
are
who...
who
could
make
up...
who
would
own
a
majority
of
the
acres?
justice
white
it's
rather
strange
if
a
very
few
people
could
vote
a
majority
of
the
land,
it's
very
strange
that
a
majority
of
the
eligible
land
has
never
been
voted,
apparently?
people
with
that
much
of
an
interest,
you
would
think
would
vote.
justice
white
yes,
but
if
a
few
landowners...
if
a
few
very
large
landowners,
not
very
many,
could
cast
more
than
19,000
acres,
could
vote
more--
justice
white
--well
then,
let's
suppose
that
every
landowner
in
the
district
owned
only
one...
less
than
an
acre.
then
what's
wrong
with
the
voting
system;
it's
one
man
one
vote
almost,
isn't
it?
justice
white
theoretically,
yes.
justice
white
well
i
don't
know,
if
you
can't
tell
us
how
many
people
are
around
in
this
district
who
own
large
acres
of
land,
one
of
your
fundamental
complaints
is
that
just
a
few
people
can
run
this
district?
justice
white
what
public...
you
said
public
decision
making?
that
sort
of
assumes
the
question
in
the
case,
doesn't
it?
what
is
the
public
decision
making
that's
going
on?
justice
white
so
the
decision
making
of
the
district,
of
which--
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
if
there
is
a...
who
makes
the
decision
to
issue
revenue
bonds?
justice
white
they
don't
have
an
election?
justice
white
about
revenue
bonds?
justice
white
thank
you.
