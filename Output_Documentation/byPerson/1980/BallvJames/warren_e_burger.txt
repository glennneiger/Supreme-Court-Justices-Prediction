chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
ball
against
james.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
are
you
saying
that
under
the
arizona
constitution
the
legislature
could
forbid
all
nuclear
power?
chief
justice
burger
they
could
do
the
same
with
fossil
fuel?
chief
justice
burger
and
that's
in
conflict
with
what
the
state
supreme
court
has
said,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
meyerson.
chief
justice
burger
excuse
me.
a
few
minutes
ago
you
seemed
to
have
a
distinction
between
water
being
provided
for
people
in
the
cities
to
drink
and
other
purposes,
and
water
provided
for
irrigation.
do
you
consider
those
on
a
different
level,
one
higher
than
the
other?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
furnishing
of
electric
power
is
inherently
or
primarily
a
governmental
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
afraid
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
meyerson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lee,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
79-1740,
ball
against
james,
and
in
80-317,
university
of
texas
against
camenisch
will
each
be
announced
by
justice
stewart.
