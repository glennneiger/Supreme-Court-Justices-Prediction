mr.
geller,
what
was
the
basis
of
the
district
of
court's
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
government
be
in
a
better
position
here
if
the
tucker
act
had
been
repealed
or
never
been
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
drawing
a
disqualification
statute
for
judges,
wouldn't
this
be
one
of
the
very
first
things
that
you
would
consider,
a
case
in
which
they
were
passing
on
their
own
salaries?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
canon
of
ethics
imposes
a
duty
on
the
judiciary
to
file
a
suit
urging
other
judges
to
raise
their
salary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
the
disqualification
act
requires
a
judge
to
disqualify
himself
if
he
owns
one
share
of
stock
in
a
corporation
that
is
litigated
before
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
language
in
evans
v.
gore,
which
is
relied
on
in
the
court
of
claims
opinion
and
so
forth,
was
rendered
at
a
time
when
the
disqualification
statute
didn't
apply
to
supreme
court
justices,
so
it
was
really
dicta,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
other
result
is
not
particularly
appealing
either,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
have
adjudicated
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
compensation,
then,
you're
talking
about
united
states
dollars,
in
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
what
if
the
congress
decided
that
the
court
would
only
be
allocated
one
car,
instead
of
two
or
three
or
whatever
it
has,
next
year.
and--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
parking
space.
would
that
be
called
diminution
of
compensation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
congress
repeal
the
tucker
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
don't
you
run
into
a
real
political--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
a
constitutional
collision
between
the
diminution
provisions
of
article
iii
and
the
provision
of
article
i
that
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
save
by
appropriation
by
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
there
have
to
be
a
forum
for
every
conceivable
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
hamilton
in
federalist
78
refers
to
the
judiciary
as
the
weakest
branch,
because
it
has
neither
the
power
of
the
purse
nor
the
sword.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
stressing
a
reliance
element,
certainly
the
court
of
claims
rationale
might
be
expanded
to
say
that
a
judge
who
goes
on
the
bench
expects
that
congress
will
increase
his
salary
as
inflation
increases,
and
yet
you
don't
take
that
broad
a
position,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
there
never
had
been
a
federal
salary
act
and
it
was
simply
set
the
way
it
had
been
50
years
ago;
congress
enacted
a
law
saying
the
salary
of
a
judge
shall
be
such
and
such,
and
in
a
particular
year
congress
increased
its
own
salary
five-fold
but
left
the
judges
exactly
where
they
were,
it
didn't
reduce
them
at
all?
any
problem?
