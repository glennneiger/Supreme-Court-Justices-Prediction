justice
stewart
"as
adjusted,
each
judge"...
and
this
is
the
district
judge...
"shall
receive
a
salary
at
an
annual
rate
determined
under
the
federal
salary
act,
as
adjusted
by
the
executive
salary
cost-of-living
adjustment
act.
"
justice
stewart
that
is
the
statutory
salary
that
a
judge
receives.
justice
stewart
it
says,
"each
judge
shall
receive"
that
salary.
you
didn't
mention
that,
did
you?
justice
stewart
well,
that's
all
it
does,
but
it
does
do
that.
justice
stewart
and
then
there's
a
separate
statute
for
circuit
judges
and--
justice
stewart
--but
each
one
is
similar,
or
is
it?
justice
stewart
but
it
was
substantially
after
midnight,
or
one
minute
after--
justice
stewart
do
i
take
it
that
you
have
implicitly
conceded
that
the
1979
legislation
did
reduce
the--
justice
stewart
--there's
no
question
that
it
did.
justice
stewart
well,
there's
a
statutory
question
there,
isn't
there?
that's
the
issue?
justice
stewart
you
say
it's
there,
but
that's
an
issue
in
this
case.
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
and
what
is
the
rule
of
necessity?
briefly,
it
is
that
if
every
judge
is
disqualified,
then
nobody
is
disqualified.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
apply,
for
example,
if
four
members
of
this
court
were
for
some
reason
or
another
disqualified
but
five
were
not?
justice
potter
stewart
this
court
couldn't
act
because
there
wouldn't
be
a
quorum,
but
it
wouldn't
be
applicable
there,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
rule,
as
i've
phrased
it,
would
not
be
applicable,
which
is
that
the
rule
of
necessity
is
applicable
only
if
all
judges
are
disqualified.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
in
this
case,
every
federal
judge
is
for
one
reason
or
two
reasons
disqualified?
justice
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
in
this
case
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
which
is
the
case
you
did
bring,
every
federal
judge
in
the
united
states
has
got
a
financial
interest.
justice
stewart
the
same
as
the
condemnation
clause.
the
same
as
the
condemnation
clause...
the
federal
government
couldn't
appropriate
property
and
then
have
congress
say,
well,
we
think
that
the
court
that
held
the
owner
of
that
property
was
entitled
to
just
compensation
was
simply
mistaken.
we're
not
going
to
appropriate
any
money.
justice
stewart
following
up
my
brother
stevens'
earlier
question
to
you
about
whether
or
not
in
your
submission
congress
could
repeal
the
adjustment
act,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
could
congress
now
amend
28
u.s.c.
135
and
say
that
the
salary
of
district
judges
shall
be
$55,000
per
annum,
which
would
not
be
a
reduction
or
$65,000
per
annum,
to
sweep
away
any
questions?
just
amend
the
present
28
u.s.c.
135
to
so
provide.
justice
stewart
waiver.
justice
stewart
anybody
who
takes
that
rate
waives
any
claim
under
the
constitution.
justice
stewart
but
in
answer
to
my
question,
your
answer
is,
no?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
saying
it
didn't...
congress
could
promise
a
lot
of
things
and
they
might
default
on
their
promises
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
every
promise
they
make
to
judges
is
"compensation"
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
there
is
no
question
they
made
a
promise
and
they've
not
fulfilled
their
promise.
but
i
don't
think
it
follows
that,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow...
it
may...
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
what
they
promised
was
compensation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
promise
itself
was
compensation.
justice
stewart
and
that
statutory
argument
would
make
the
increases
up,
well,
not
only
to
judges
but
to
everybody
else
covered?
justice
stewart
that
is
the
'76
act?
the
one
that
was
not
an
appropriations
act?
justice
stewart
no,
no,
not
originally,
the
compensation
clause
didn't.
that
was
a
proposal.
justice
stewart
well,
that
was
never
in
the
constitution.
