justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
you
don't
think,
then,
that
that
quadrennial
increase
was
effective
to
wipe
out
any
entitlement
to
any
prior
cost-of-living
increases?
justice
white
if
they
were
entitled
to
it?
justice
white
i
see.
well,
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
for
the
future,
it
does
take
the
place
of
any
future
entitlement
to
the
4.8
after
october
1?
justice
white
i
got
it.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
did
effect
a
permanent
disentitlement
to
the
4.8
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right;
fine.
justice
white
well,
your
brief
doesn't
make
this
clear,
but
it's...
but
that's
wholly
consistent
with
your
position,
i
must
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
geller,
as
part
of
the
facts...
i
take
it
this
is
part
of
the
facts...
on
october
1,
1979,
the
government
seems
to
agree,
at
least
in
its
brief,
that
the
october
1
increase
did
go
into
effect--
justice
byron
r.
white
--along
with
the
increase
that
had
been
suspended
for
the
prior
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it's
for
a
total
of
12.9
percent--
justice
byron
r.
white
--did
go
into
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
any
other
part
of
the
executive
branch
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see;
i
see.
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
judge
was
disqualified?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
assume
he
was,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
we
would
have
appellate
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
we
were
disqualified?
justice
white
and
so
we
should
say,
except
where
the
rule
of
necessity
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
add
it
on
to
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
add
on
to
the
statute
an
exception?
justice
white
they
wouldn't
be
parties.
justice
white
they
wouldn't
be
a
party.
justice
white
for
that
year--
justice
white
was
it
passed
or
signed,
or
both?
justice
white
but
that's
not
true
of
the
'76?
justice
white
if
the
established
rule
was,
as
you
argue,
that
an
act
is
effective
on
the
day
it's
signed,
but
retroactive
to
the
previous
midnight,
i
suppose
the
president
might
have
thought
october
1
was
the
last
day
he
could
sign
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
basic
constitutional
argument
is
that
congress
has
the
power
to
lower
the
salaries
of
federal
judges
along
with
the
salaries
of
other
government
officials
as
long
as
you
can't
characterize
the
reduction
as
discriminatory
and
as
aimed
at
judges
in
a
way
that
might
threaten
their
independence.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
agree
with
you
otherwise,
we
then
must
face
the
constitutional
issue
for
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
understand
that,
but
if
we
agree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
if
i
agree
with
you,
with
the
government,
as
to
the
effect
of
all
the
acts,
just
the
way
you
argue,
then
we
must
face
the
constitutional
issue
on
reduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
we
must...
for
whatever
we
face
it,
we
have
to
face
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
then,
you've
decided
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
if
it
is
not,
the
act
is
constitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
that's
the
power
congress
was
asserting?
on
october
12,
after
the
pay
increases
had
gone
into
effect--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
thought
they
had
reduced
the
salaries,
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
could
have
brought
this
case
and
had
a
judgment
if
you'd
have
sued
mr.
foley,
the
head
of
the
administrative
office?
would
there
have
been
a
case
or
controversy
between
this
class
of
judges
and
mr.
foley?
could
you
have
proceeded
on
that
basis
rather
than
against
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
decided
not
to,
but
i'm...
for
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
didn't
ask...
this
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
have
sued
mr.
foley
and
stayed
in
court
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
want
to
know
whether
you
could
have
obtained
in
a
suit
against
him
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
or
constitutionality
of
these
statutes,
or
have
the
statutes
construed?
after
all,
mr.
foley
turned
around
and
brought
a
suit
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
answer
was,
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
am.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
addressing
the
rule
of
necessity.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
a
federal
judge
have
to
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
i
mean,
state
courts
hear
federal
question
cases
all
the
time.
justice
white
i'm
asking,
suing
mr.
foley?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
say
then
that
the
rule
of
necessity
applies
if
there
were
some
judges
in
the
united
states
who
could
hear
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
all,
it's
been
argued,
and
certainly
some
state
courts
have
entertained
1983
suits.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is
not
a
1983
case
but
i'm
just
suggesting
to
you
that
state
courts
decide
federal
questions
all
the
time.
justice
white
it
can,
as
to
other
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
comparability
act,
though,
the
report
is
to
the
president
and
then
the
president
makes
a
recommendation
to
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
either
house
of
congress
can
disapprove
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
goes
back
to
the
president.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
congress...
under
the
terms
of
the
comparability
act,
you
are
asserting
congress
has
no
power
to
keep
a
recommended
increase
from
going
into
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
president
doesn't
take
the
recommendation
of
his
agent?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
and
so
say
he...
say
the
agent
recommends
13
percent,
the
president
comes
in
with
ten.
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
rejects
it.
the
government's
brief
says,
"in
that
event
the
president
must
again
consider
the
report
of
his
agent
and
adjust
the
rates
of
pay
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
comparability.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
suppose
he
does,
and
the
congress
rejects
it
again?
justice
white
well,
that
just
can't
be,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
reason,
perhaps,
for
not
being
able
to
prove
discrimination
is
that
there
isn't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
one
reason
why
you
might
not
be
able
to
prove
it
is
that
there
isn't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
one
of
the...
nevertheless,
it's
one
of
the
reasons.
suppose
that
the
government...
suppose
congress
reduced
the
salaries
of
every
government
employee
in
the
united
states,
including
judges.
now,
it
may
be
you
couldn't
prove
discrimination
because
there
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it'd
be
impossible.
there
isn't
any.
justice
white
well,
you
would
be
satisfied,
i
suppose,
without
having
a
suit
for
the
money,
do
you
think
that
you
would
win
enough
if
you
had
a
judgment
of
unconstitutionality?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
forde,
could
i
go
back?
you
agreed
that,
when
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
you,
that
the
quadrennial
adjustment
in
1977
took
care
of
the
four...
the
'76
increase
prospectively?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
quadrennial
increase
took
place--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
'77,
didn't
it?
justice
white
and
you
agree
that
that
took
care
of
the
'76
increase
prospectively?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
you
do
not
agree
that
that
also
disentitled
the
judges
to
the
'77
increase?
the
comparability...
the
cost
of
living
increase.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
argues,
apparently,
that
the
pay
act
of
'77
took
care
of
both
increases.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
he
say?
there
was
a
scheduled
cost-of-living
increase
to
go
into
effect
on
october
1,
'77.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kept
it
from
going
into
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
so
that
is
different
from
the
quadrennial
increases?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
all
right;
thank
you.
justice
white
--that's
almost
a
fortiori
from
your
position.
