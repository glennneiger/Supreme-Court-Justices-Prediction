justice
stevens
provided
that
the
new
level
is
higher
than
the
percentages
involved?
justice
stevens
if
it's
not,
of
course,
then
the
issue
will
remain.
justice
stevens
all
right.
yet...
mr.
geller,
in
reviewing
the
fairly
complicated
statutory
system
under
which
judicial
salaries
are
determined,
did
you
mention
the
basic
statute,
28
u.s.c.
section
135?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
for
a
moment,
on
the
september
30,
'78,
statute,
is
that
the
only
one
of
these
statutes
in
which
congress
expressly
limited
the
effect
of
the
statute
to
the
then,
to
the
year
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says,
"no
part
of
the
fund
appropriated
hereby
shall
be
used
to
pay
salaries
for
this
period--
"
is
that
language
repeated
in
the
other
statutes
or
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
of
the
acts
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
one
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
would
you
tell
me
your
understanding
of,
if
you
had
to
state
the
rule.
what
is
the
rule
of
necessity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
you
know,
it's
a
small
point,
but
your
opponents
take
issue
with
your
use
of
the
term
"pay
act".
is
that
a
term
that
you
just
coined
for
purposes
of
litigation
or
does
it
have
any
history
beyond
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
a
term
congress
uses?
justice
stevens
and
how
to
you
respond
to
that
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
is
it
not
true
that
the
general
rule
and
its
exception
deal
with
how
you
construe
what
congress
intended
to
do.
it's
a
construction
of
the
statute
rather
than
its
effect?
and
it's
no
question
here,
they
intended
that
the
statute
would
be
effective
as
of
12:01
a.m.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
question
is,
whether
the
increase
in
salary
having
been
in
effect
for
several
hours,
does
article
iii
of
the
constitution
prevent
the
president
and
the
congress
from
then
rescinding
that,
what
had
become
effective?
and
it
is
true
that,
say,
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
there
was
a
different
salary
rate
in
effect,
wasn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
9
o'clock
in
the
morning,
if
you
were
then
asked
what
the
salary
was,
you
would
have
to
have
said,
as
of
this
moment
the
4.8
percent
has
gone
into
effect,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
even
if,
later
on,
unambiguously,
congress
said,
we
intend
to
cut
it
back
as
of
12:01
a.m.,
then
the
question
is,
can
they
do
that
constitutionally?
none
of
the
cases
you've
cited
deal
with
a
question
remotely
like
this,
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
what
the
intent
of
the
statute
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
purely
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
ones
cited
in
the
footnote
to
your
brief
all
dealt
with
the
question
of
statutory
construction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
on
that
point,
they
also
thought
in
'79
that
they
could
wait
12
days,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
they
deliberately
acted
in
an
unconstitutional
manner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
the
provision
of
the
statute,
if
anyone
takes
the
12.9
percent,
there's
a
waiver
of
anything...
if
he
takes
5.5
percent,
there's
a
waiver
of
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
say
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
took
the
5.5
percent
sometime
later,
would
he
retain
or
give
up
the
right
to
12.9
percent
for
the
12
days
when
it
was
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
these
appellees...
none
of
these
appellees
took
the
5.5
percent.
i
wonder
what
would
the
government's
position
be
with
respect
to
the
consequences
of
taking
the
5.5
percent
with
respect
to
the
right
to
the
12.9
percent
for
12
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
forde,
if
you
take
the
view
that
the
right
granted
by
the
adjustment
act
to
a
future
adjustment
upward
in
salary
is
compensation
within
the
meaning
of
the
compensation
clause,
does
it
follow
that
congress
would
not
have
the
power
to
repeal
the
adjustment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is,
pursuant
to
the
adjustment
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
how
they
could
constitutionally
repeal
the
adjustment
act.
in
fact,
i
thought
in
the
footnote
it
says
they
could
repeal
the
comparability
act
but
could
not
repeal
the
adjustment
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
adjustment
act
is
in
effect.
but
i'm
asking
you,
consistently
with
the
constitution,
could
congress
repeat
the
adjustment
act?
the
government
says--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
say,
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
have
no
objection
if
after
the
case
is
decided
congress
passed
another
statute
and
said,
we
will
not
appropriate
any
funds
to
pay
the
judgment
under
the
will
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
still
be
happy
if
congress
passed
the
statute
i
just
suggested?
would
they
have
constitutional
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
really
discussing
settlement,
i'm
discussing
the
question
whether
in
the
last
analysis
your
argument
is
sound,
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
in
fact
give
the
ultimate
power
of
the
purse
to
congress,
and
if
congress
wanted
to
act,
say
that
congress
firmly
believes
that
your
opponent's
constitutional
argument
is
correct,
what
would
prevent
congress
from
saying,
well,
we're
just
not
going
to
appropriate
the
money
to
pay
that
judgment,
because
the
judgment
is
not
in
accordance
with
our
views
of
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
one
of
the
limitations
is
not
the
power
in
judges
to
write
checks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
the
analogy
is
perfect,
because
even
if
one
assumes
that
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
an
adjustment,
which
might
be
described
as
an
increase,
it
seems
to
me
it
does
not
necessarily
follow,
although
it
might,
that
that
right
is
an
ingredient
of
compensation
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
see,
there
are
two
things
you
have
to
convince
us
of.
one,
that
there's
a
statutory
right.
and,
secondly,
that
that
right
is
part
of
compensation
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
see,
it
could
well
be
that
the
labor
union
person
has
a
right
to
an
adjustment
in
his
compensation
as
a
matter
of
contracts,
but
it
wouldn't
necessarily
follow
that
that
right
is
part
of
the
compensation
covered
by
article
iii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
right...
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
assuming
such
right
exists
as
a
statutory
matter,
that
that's
compensation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
it
a
right
to
have
your
compensation
changed
in
the
future,
which
would
be
conceptually
quite
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
really
not
any
different
from
a
statute
that
simply
said,
the
salary
of
a
district
judge
shall
be
$55,000
a
year.
that's
a
promise;
it's
no
more
and
no
less.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
promise
that
you'll
receive
at
least
that
for
the
rest
of
your
judicial
career.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
forde,
just
to
understand
your
statutory
theory,
if
you
prevail
on
what
the
government
refers
to
as
the
1977
pay
act,
that
would
mean
that
the
quadrennial
adjustment
for
'77
was
then
increased
by
71
percent,
effective
october
1,
1977.
and
that
increased
amount
would
then
be
the
base
as
to
which
the
12-point-something
percent
for
the
next
two
years
applies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it's
necessary
if
we
go
through...
if
you
win
on
all
the
statutory
arguments,
that
you
build
that
7.7
percent
into
the
salary
which
is
later
increased.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
entirely
technical.
it
says
if
you're
going
to
give
raises
to
others,
you've
got
to
give
them
to
judges
too,
whereas
your
view
would
allow
them
just
to
take
it
out
for
judges
and
leave
everybody
else
get
a
raise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view,
they
could
raise
the
salaries
of
all
government
personnel
except
judges,
under
the
comparability
act
and
the
adjustment
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view...
now,
let's
get
this
clear...
under
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
congress
clearly
could
say,
henceforth
the
adjustment
act
shall
apply
to
all
federal
employees
except
judges.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
you
say
that
would
not
be
a
diminution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
article
iii
doesn't
apply;
therefore,
they
can
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
your
basic
position
is
that
they
could
modify
the
legislation
to
say,
all
federal
personnel
except
judges
shall
get
the
benefit
of
the
adjustment
act.
