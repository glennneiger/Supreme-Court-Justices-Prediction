mr.
kevin
m.
forde
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
won't
be
divided
argument.
we
appreciate
the
order
the
court
entered,
graciously
granting
that
permission
but
we
have
concluded
that
the
comments
can
be
made
accurately...
accurately
and
appropriately
by
counsel.
the
point
we--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--i'm
sorry,
justice
brennan.
the
point
that
we
desire
to
make
and
the
explanation
that
we
think
we
owe
the
american
people
if
not
the
court
in
an
unusual
case
like
this,
a
case
brought
by
judges
in
federal
courts,
is
that
it's
their
duty
to
bring
such
a
case.
this
court
has
said
so
in
the
o'donoghue
decisions
and
in
other
cases.
the
american
bar
association
canons
of
ethics
impose
such
a
duty
upon
the
judiciary,
and--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--canon
1
of
the
american
bar
association
canons
of
judicial
ethics
says
it's
the
responsibility
of
a
judge
to
preserve
the
independence
of
the
judiciary.
this
case
involves
the
independence
of
the
judiciary.
i
think
that...
and
this
raises
exactly
the
point
that
we
attempt
to
make.
while
it's
a
case
that
does
involve
judges'
pay,
judges
like
judges
campbell
and
will,
for
example,
would
not
have
filed
a
lawsuit
in
a
federal
court
for
the
comparatively
few
dollars
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
but
it
in
their
opinion
presents
an
issue
of
critical
constitutional
moment
that
must
be
decided
by
this
court,
because
they
believe
that
if
congress
can
do
this...
at
the
time
they
filed
the
suit
it
was
only
two
years.
they
feared
they
would
attempt
to
do
it
again,
and
in
fact
their
fears
have
been
proven
by
history.
now
they've
done
it
five
years
in
a
row.
they
feared
that
ultimately
the
solicitor
general
or
the
department
of
justice
may
take
some
position,
for
example,
that
congress
can
do
whatever
they
want
to
judges'
salaries
so
long
as
they
treat
others
the
same
way.
and
such,
other,
such
argument,
that
seems
to
be
completely
in
contradiction
to
article
iii.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
correct.
there's
an
exception
to
the
disqualification
statute
in
the
rule
of
necessity.
the
rule
of
necessity...
we
agree
fully
with
the
solicitor
general
on
this
point...
the
rule
of
necessity
has
been
in
effect
as
long
as
we
have
know
it.
we've
cited
cases
in
this
court
in
these
appeals.
we've
cited
cases
and
referred
the
court
to
the
briefs
in
the
atkins
case.
and
as
long
as
federal
courts
have
been
sitting,
there
has
been
a
rule
of
necessity.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
disqualification
statute
or
any
other
disqualification
statute,
that
congress
intended
to
change
that.
and,
in
fact,
there
is
testimony
in
legislative
history
before
the
congress
in
adopting
this
disqualification
statute
that
they
intended
to
preserve
the
rule
of
necessity.
so
there
is
no
question
but
that
any
judge,
including
the
judges
of
this
court,
are
disqualified
in
this
appeal
or
that
the
district
judge
or
any
other
district
or
circuit
judge
is
disqualified
from
hearing
these
cases.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
if
every
judge
is
disqualified,
then
nobody
is
disqualified.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
it
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
know;
that's
an
interesting
question.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
think
there
is
an
instance,
justice
stewart,
where,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
chief
justice
stone
invoked
the
rule
by
implication,
at
least,
because
the
court
couldn't
get
a
quorum.
and
i
think
the
government
cited
it
either
in
this
case
or
the
atkins.
so
i
would
read
the
rule
of
necessity
as
applying
if
it's
necessary
to
get
a
quorum.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
there
is
no
other
place...
wherever
the
case
would
be
sent,
there
is
no
judge,
even
if
he's
appointed
tomorrow,
who
wouldn't
have
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
well,
it
might
have
been
dicta
but
it's
sound
law.
the
rule
of
necessity
has
been
applied
since
1300
or
1400.
and
i
think
what
the
evans
court
was
saying
is
just
what
the
long
established
law
is.
if
you
want
to
treat
it
as
dicta,
then
today
is
the
time
to
decide
that
issue,
which
has
to
be
decided,
and
i
submit
has
to
be
decided
the
way
both
we
and
the
solicitor
general
suggest
it
must
be
decided.
the
result
is
chaos.
the
contrary
would
be
chaos.
the
contrary
would
mean
that
if
congress
passed
a
statute
tomorrow
saying
that
all
judges
of
this
court
have
to
resign
in
five
years,
there's
no
one
who
could
challenge
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
oh,
it's
not
appealing,
but
when
you
look
at
the
alternative
it's
not
that
difficult,
in
my
judgment.
the
point
i
was
starting
to
make
is,
we
feel
we
owe
an
explanation
to
the
american
people
as
to
why
federal
judges
sue
in
federal
courts.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
have
to
because
there's
no
other
place
to
go
and
they
had
an
oath,
we
felt,
part
of
their
oath
of
office,
to
bring
the
case.
judge
roszkowski
had
an
oath
of
office
to
decide
the
case,
and
i
think
you're
in
the
same
boat.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
we
thought
not,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
we
thought--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--we
thought
not,
because
we
thought
that
we
were
suing
under
the
tucker
act
and
that
says
you
sue
the
united
states--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--well,
let
me
get--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--it
wouldn't
have...
if
your
question
suggests--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--i
don't
know
the
answer,
justice
white.
i
know
this--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--you're
addressing
it
to
solve
the
disqualification
question?
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
it
would
have
no
effect
on
that.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
it
would
have
had
no
effect
on
it
because
if
we
sued
mr.
foley
instead
of
the
united
states,
a
federal
judge
having
an
interest
in
the
case
would
have
to
decide
it.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
the
parties
are.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--because
it's
a
case
brought
in,
it
has
to
be
brought
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
know
of
any
other
forum
to
raise
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
we
know
of
no
jurisdictional
basis
for
bringing
this
case
in
a
state
court.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
no.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
you
can't
sue
the
united
states
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
know
if
we
could
have
gotten
the
relief
against
mr.
foley.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
think
we
could--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--this
isn't
a
1983
case.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
know
of
no
basis
upon
which
we
could
have
obtained
the
relief
that
we
sought
in
this
case
in
any
state
courts.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that
may
have
been
a
problem.
i
simply
don't
know
of
any
basis
upon
which
we
could
sue
him.
i
think
also
the
point
is
that
suits
against
officials
are
deemed
suits
against
the
united
states.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
i
believe,
then,
i've
made
the
point
why
we
felt
this
case
had
to
be
brought,
why
the
plaintiffs
felt
this
case
had
to
be
brought.
i'd
like
next
to
address
the
arguments
that
are
raised.
the
most
important
point,
i
think,
that
has
to
be
discussed
is
the
contention
of
the
solicitor
general
and
the
department
of
justice
in
these
cases
that
a
judge
cannot
prove
a
violation
of
article
iii,
section
1,
without
showing,
proving
discrimination.
i
guess
this
takes
us
to
to
where
the
statutes
are,
what
the
constitution
provides.
the
constitution
provides,
in
very
unequivocal
terms,
that
a
judge
is
to
receive
a
compensation
which
shall
not
be
diminished.
mr.
geller
opened
his
comments
by
saying
that
these
were
complex
statutes.
these
are
about
as
simple
and
unequivocal
as
statutes
as
appear
on
the
books.
not
a
one
of
them
exceeds
more
than
a
few
lines
that
are
relevant
here.
section
135
provides
a
salary
for
a
district
judge.
the
language
of
the
other
statutes
for
other
judges
are
in
the
same
language.
one-thirty-five
provides
that
a
district
judge
shall
receive
a
salary
at
a
rate
determined
under
the
salary
act,
as
has
been
discussed,
as
adjusted
by
the
adjustment
act.
the
salary
act,
of
course,
is
the
provision
for
the
quadrennial
raises
on
those
few
occasions
that
congress
permits
them
to
go
ahead.
and
i
might
add
that
the
system
has
now
been
changed
so
that
it
requires
an
affirmative
vote
in
both
houses
before
a
raise
can
go
into
effect
under
the
salary
act.
but
the
adjustment
act,
which
is
the
principal
act
at
issue
here,
provides
in
very
unequivocal
terms...
and
the
relevant
portions
are
again
about
two
lines
long...
it
provides
that
for
each
fiscal
year
judges'
salaries
shall
be
adjusted
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
percentage
adjustment
granted
general
schedule
employees.
incidentally,
none
of
the
statutes
that
have
been
referred
to
that
are
intended
to
prevent
that
adjustment,
including
the
one
adopted
in
july,
1977,
ever
mention
any
intent
to
repeal
or
modify
or
amend
the
rights
under
the
adjustment
act.
the
adjustment
act
applies
to
all
executive
level
employees
except
with
respect
to
judges.
that
section
says,
it
can
never
be
downward.
there
was
a
question
earlier
about
whether
the
adjustment
under
the
comparability
act
can
be
a
downward
adjustment--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--as
to
other
employees,
there
can
be
a
downward
adjustment.
as
to
judges,
there
never
can
be.
until
these
cases
were
brought
and
until
this
recent
history
by
congress,
the
compensation
clause
has
always
been
honored
by
congress.
even
in
the
great
depression
when
the
salaries
of
other
federal
employees
were
reduced
and
reduced
and
reduced
for
good
reason,
congress
never
tampered
with
judges'
pay.
now,
there
were
income
tax
cases.
atkins
involved
a
question
of
whether
judges
who
were
suffering
from
inflation
were
entitled
to
an
increase
because
they
weren't
receiving
compensation,
in
real
dollars,
the
same
as
prior
years.
but
when
it
come
to
the
basic
salary
statutes,
28
u.s.c.
135
and
the
prior
statutes
like
that,
congress
never
made
any
attempt
to
tamper
with
those
statutes.
the
only
thing
that
came
anywhere
near
it
was
the
booth
case,
which
we
decided,
and
that
was...
and
there
they
attempted
to
cut
the
pay
of
a
retired
judge.
and
the
department
of
justice
said,
in
that
case
a
retired
judge
is
not
an
article
iii
judge.
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
the
court
at
that
time,
decided
that
he
was
an
article
iii
judge.
the
solicitor
general
in
that
case
said,
if
he
is
an
article
iii
judge,
we
concede
that
his
compensation
may
not
be
cut...
even
in
this
time
of
depression.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
no,
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
the
salaries
set
by
the
salary
acts,
the
salary
act,
the
adjustment
act,
and
28
u.s.c.
section
135
for
judges.
that
is
a
judge's
pay,
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
may
not
be
reduced.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
or
parking
space?
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
know.
there
are
a
number
of
things
like
that
you
could
explore.
i
don't
know
how
far
compensation
goes.
i
know
it
includes
at
least
this
much,
the
salary
of
a
judge
as
provided
by
the
salary
act
and
adjustment
act
and
28
u.s.c.
135.
how
much
farther
it
goes
isn't
before
the
court
today.
but
it's
certainly
our
reading
of
the
word
compensation,
as
an
academic
inquiry,
would
indicate,
me
to
believe,
that
it's
much
broader
than
just
that.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
they
can,
but
the
result
of
their
disapproval--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--is,
it
goes
back
to
the
president
or,
automatically,
accepts
the
report
of
the
president's
agent.
they
get
a...
the
general
schedule
employees--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--that's
right.
they
can
reject
the
president's,
but
the
effect
of
their
rejection
of
the
president
would
be
to
put
into
effect
the
higher
recommendation
of
the
president's
agent.
in
other
words,
like
this
year,
the
president's
agent
said
that
the
appropriate
adjustment
for
federal
employees
would
be
13-some
percent,
as
i
recall.
1980.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
he
didn't.
he
said,
9.1.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
yes.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
yes.
what
they're
saying
is--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
they
get
two
turns.
my
understanding
of
the
way
that
act
works...
for
example,
this
year,
justice
white,
they
recommended
13
percent,
the
president
recommended
nine.
if
either
house
of
congress
rejected
it
within
30
days,
the
net
effect
would
be
the
13
percent
would
have
gone
into
effect.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
think
that's
the
statute.
in
discussing
the
discrimination
argument,
we
left
off
on
the
discussion
of
the
booth
case.
the
government
is
arguing
here
essentially
that
judges
have
an
equal
protection
claim
and
all
i
can
say
on
that
point
is,
if
you
read
the
debates,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
saying
that
a
judge's
pay
may
not
be
reduced.
the
language
of
hamilton
that
his
circumstance
should
never
be
less,
there
just
are
reams
of
history
on
the
point,
and
they
all
seem
to
be
clearly
talking
about
you
can
never
cut
a
judge's
pay.
if
they
meant
that
you
could
never
cut
a
judge's
pay,
or
that
you
could
cut
a
judge's
pay
so
long
as
you
also
cut
the
pay
of
congressmen
and
ambassadors,
then
they
wouldn't
have
included
in
the
language
that
they
did.
in
fact
they
specifically
considered
those
points.
in
article
i
they
provided
that
congress
can
set
its
pay
and
the
pay
of
other
federal
employees
any
way
it
wants,
upward
or
downward.
and
article
ii,
it
says
with
respect
to
the
president,
you
cannot
cut
his
pay.
article
iii,
with
respect
to
the
judiciary,
the
other
great
branch
of
government,
you
cannot
cut
their
pay.
so
the
constitution
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
argument
that
you'd
have
to
prove
discrimination.
i
think
the
point
ought
to
be
made,
too,
in
this
case
we
can't
prove
discrimination.
we
have
worked
on
these
issues
for
years.
i
can't
imagine
a
case
where
you
can
prove
discrimination.
and
the
history...
or,
the
congressional
motivation...
the
history
of
the
compensation
clause
is
that
congress,
or
that
the
framers
wanted
to
remove
even
the
threat
of
such
a
confrontation
where
judges
would
be--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--there
isn't
any?
i
don't
know
if
there
is
or
there
isn't,
justice
white.
i
know
that--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--i
don't
know
if
there
is
or
there
isn't
but
we
can't
prove
it.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
well,
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
in
the
depression
there
was
no
question
that
even
when
they
attempted
to
do
it
with
judge
booth,
there
wasn't
any
discrimination,
there
was
no
malice.
they
wanted
to
cut
federal
employees'
salaries
to
save
money.
there
was
no
question
of
discrimination.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i'd
point
out
that
the
concerns
raised
by
the
friends
of
the
court
briefs,
including
that
of
the
american
bar
association,
which
describes
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
here
as
a
novel
concept,
without
support
in
history
or
authority
which
would
completely
undermine
the
compensation
clause.
but,
in
effect,
with
respect
to
the
discrimination
argument,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
it
is
not
a
necessary
element
to
prove
discrimination
and
that
in
fact
the
compensation
clause
means
exactly
what
it
says,
then
we
believe
the
court
must
affirm
two
counts
of
the
judgments
below,
without
further
discussion.
those
are
the
events
of
october
12,
1979,
and
also
october
1,
1976.
we
can
juggle
back
and
forth
about
the
occurrence
on
october
1,
1976,
the
relation-back
theory.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
when
a
judge
went
to
work
on
october
1,
1976,
a
district
judge
who
was
making--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--yes.
yes,
it
is.
sure,
because
his
salary
went
from
$42,000
to
$44,000
on
october
1,
1976,
a
district
judge.
and
then,
on
march
1,
1977,
it
went
to
$54,500,
as
i
recall.
so
that
eliminated
that.
the
claim
ends
march
1.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
yes.
the
claim
ends
at
that
time.
the
result
of
the
court's
decision,
we
also
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
result
of
the
court's
decision
on
the
october
1,
1976,
will
necessarily
govern
the
ultimate
disposition
of
the
case,
which
hasn't
been
filed,
but
october
1,
1980,
the
circumstances
are
identical.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
hope
so,
your
honor.
i
certainly
hope
so.
with
respect
to
the
other
two
counts,
the
question
that
is
before
the
court,
the
constitutional
question,
is
when
does
the
right
to
this
adjustment
mature?
we
submit,
very
respectfully,
that
it
matured
on
the
effective
date
of
the
adjustment
act.
the
statute...
getting
back
to
one
of
the
first
points
made...
the
statute
is
clear
and
unequivocal.
it
says
that
the
salary
shall,
he
shall
receive
a
salary
as
adjusted
by
the
adjustment
act.
in
the
o'donoghue,
the
o'donoghue
decision
which
we've
cited
in
our
briefs
and
it's
discussed
in
both
briefs,
the
supreme
court
stated
that
it
condemned
as
in
violation
of
article
iii
"all
which
by
their
necessary
operation
and
effect
withhold
or
take
from
the
judge
a
part
of
that
which
has
been
promised
by
law
for
his
services.
"
now,
we
think
that
any
judge
ascending
to
the
bench,
any
person
ascending
to
the
bench,
any
judge
sitting
on
the
bench
reading
the
salary
act
and
the
adjustment
act
and
28
u.s.c.
135
would
take
those
to
mean
that
those
are
a
part
of
what
has
been
promised
by
law
for
his
services.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
no.
i
submit,
justice
stevens,
they
could
repeal
the
adjustment
act,
but
they
would
have
to
make
a
one-line
amendment
to
the
comparability
act
and
say,
"and
judges
too".
judges
have
been
promised,
under
the
adjustment
act,
the
same
cost
of
living
adjustment
granted
clerk-typists
and
others
covered
by
the
general
schedules.
and
as
long
as
clerk-typists
and
other
employees
under
the
general
schedule
receive
a
cost-of-living
adjustment,
judges
are
entitled
to
a
cost-of-living
adjustment.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
pursuant
to
the
adjustment
act.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
oh,
no,
our
theory
in
this
case,
as
we
read
that
statute,
the
adjustment
act
says
a
judge
shall
receive
an
adjustment
in
the
same
amount--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--as
the
general
schedule.
so
long
as
there
is
an
adjustment
for
the
general
schedule,
there
must
be
an
adjustment--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--no.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
no.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
certainly.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
no.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
know
that
it
has
to
be
in
a
forum
for
a
claim
like
this.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
founders
of
the
constitution
would
have
wasted
all
that
time
putting
together
something,
the
compensation
clause
and
article
iii,
which
was
intended
to
have
three
branches
of
government,
of
equal
power
and
standing,
if
one
branch
could
do
nothing
about
enforcing
it.
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
yes.
very
much
so.
it's
much
more
important
to
have
that
determination.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
didn't
say
i
wouldn't
have
any
objection.
i
said
i
would
go
home
happy
if
this
court
ruled
from
the
bench
today
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
you're
entitled
to
an
adjustment.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
let
me
put
it
this
way.
let
me...
i
don't
know,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
there
were
an
offer
to
compromise
this
case
on
that
basis,
that
we
would
give
up
the
claim
for
back
pay
in
return
for
an
acknowledgement
by
the
solicitor
general
of
our
constitutional
right.
i
am
sure
i
would
have
no
problem
selling
that
proposition
on
my
clients.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
well,
when
they
gave
congress
the
power
of
the
purse,
they
put
some
strings
on
the
purse.
there's
some
limitations.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
well,
but
it's
clear,
if
you
read
the
federalist,
it's
clear
that
they
said,
congress...
this
is
their
comments
on
what
they
wrote,
"congress
has
the
duty
to
provide
for
judges'
compensation
at
stated
times
and
they
can
never
make
his
circumstance
for
the
worse.
"
now,
those
are
limitations
on
congress.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
know
the
remedy
there,
or
the
remedy
here,
but
i
know
what
the
result
has
to
be.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
think
so,
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
have
any
of
those
problems
in
this
case.
the
judgments
are
affirmed.
i
fully
believe
they're
going
to
be
honored.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
there's...
the
right
to
a
cost-of-living
adjustment
is
a
component
of
a
judge's
salary,
and
so
long
as
there
are
adjustments,
comparability
adjustments
for
general
schedule
employees
then
judges
have
a
right
to
that
cost-of-living
adjustment.
now
there
are
ways
they
could
resolve
the
problem
by
giving
a
higher
rate
and
say
anyone
who
accepts
it
waives
any
claims
under
the
adjustment
act
or
something
like
that.
that's
in
fact
how
they
resolved
one
of
the
state
court
cases
that...
i
think
it
was
the
delaware
cases--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--this
was
a
waiver...
right.
they
gave
a
higher
rate
than
the
court
had
ordered
adjusted
and
then
they
said,
anyone
who
accepts
this--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--waives
any
future
claims.
and
of
course,
anyone
not
on
the
bench
never
had
a
claim,
so
that's
how
they
resolved
this
dilemma.
there
are
many
ways
to
resolve
the
mechanics.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
my
answer
is,
no.
the
government's...
i'd
like
to
make
one
or
two
more
points
on
the
government's
concept
that
the
right
to
an
adjustment
doesn't
vest
until
october
1
of
each
year...
or,
exact,
until
october
2
of
each
year,
as
i
read
them
now,
because
it
can
relate
back
to
the
day
before.
the
term
vesting
i
don't
think
belongs
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
construing
a
will
or
of
an
employment
contract.
we're
talking
about
a
language
that
is
adopted
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
for
the
purpose
of
removing
even
a
threat
of
an
attack
on
judicial
independence,
and
all
other
cases
of
this
court
and
everything
in
the
literature
says
that
this
clause
is
to
be
read
very
broadly
with
those
objectives
in
mind,
and
not
strictly,
as
you
might
strictly
construe
a
will
or
an
employment
contract.
but
even
as
an
employment
contract
there
aren't
too
many
labor
leaders
that
would
buy
the
government's
argument
that
you
don't
have
a
right
to
a
cost-of-living
adjustment
which
they
negotiated
until
january
1
or
the
first
day
of
the
fiscal
year.
those
employees
feel
that
they
have
a
right--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--but
here
i
think
it's
clear
both
places.
you
have
to
have
a
statutory
right--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--yes;
oh,
i
think
so.
i
think
that's
a
component
of--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--no,
i
think
that
is
a
component
of
a
judge's
salary
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
agreed,
and
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
agreed
with
that
rationale.
so,
i
don't
think
that
in
our
opinion
that
it's
even
debatable
that
it's
not
a
component
of
a
judge's
salary.
and
i
might
go
back
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
o'donoghue
case,
where
they
said
that
they
condemned
in
violation
of
article
iii
"all
which
by
their
necessary
operation
in
effect
withhold
or
take
from
a
judge
a
part
of
what
he
has
been
promised
for
his
services.
"
i
think
a
judge
going
on
the
bench
today
reads
the
adjustment
act
and
thinks
that
that
is
something
that
he
has
been
promised
for
his
services.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
well,
i
think--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--i
understand
your
question
perfectly
and
i
think
the
answer,
justice
stevens,
is
anything
that
they
promise
with
respect
to
pay
is
a
part
of
compensation.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
a
promise.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
in
fact,
to
take
up
on
what
justice
stewart
just
said,
i'll
give
you
an
example
from
the
government's
brief,
justice
stevens.
at
first
we
quibbled
about
the
formula
problem
in
this
case,
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
opening
briefs
here.
in
other
words,
we
thought
that
the
government's
problem
with
the
concept
of
a
future
promise
was
that,
well,
we
don't
know
exactly
what
it
is
yet,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
formula
is
going
to
be.
in
their
reply
brief
they
concede
that
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
formulas.
their
problem
is
that
it's
a
promise
for
the
future.
and
so,
for
example,
they
said,
if
the
congress
passed
the
law
and
the
president
signed
the
law
providing
that
judges
are
to
receive
a
$9,000
increase
payable
$3,000
march
1,
1981;
$3,000
march
1,
1982;
$3,000
march
1,
1984,
that
notes
that
is
not
an
enforceable
promise
under
the
compensation
clause
until
that
march
1
date.
now
this
is
directly
applicable
to
what
the
president
attempted
to
do
back
in
1975,
i
think,
when
president
nixon
said
he'd
go
along
with
the
25
percent
recommendation
of
his
commission
but
he
was
going
to
make
it
payable
in
three
installments.
a
lot
of
judges
resigned
because
congress
vetoed
that
recommendation.
if
they
stayed,
relying
on
the
fact
that
this
year,
this
year,
and
this
year
they
would
get
a
reasonable
compensation,
it
would
take
a
while.
i
think
that
the
promise
talked
about
in
the
o'donoghue
case
has
been
violated
and
the
constitution
has
been
violated.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
we
don't
take
that
broad
a
position
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
what
we're
saying
is
what
is
promised
by
statute
directly
relating
to
judges'
pay.
now,
the
court
of
claims
reasoning,
to
put
it
in
another
context,
you
might
say,
if
the
price
of
oil
goes
up
higher
and
a
judge
has
trouble
buying
gasoline
or
inflation
goes
on
and
on,
that
a
judge
does
not
have
an
enforceable
promise
that
his
pay
will
be
increased.
but
we're
saying
that
a
judge
has
an
enforceable
promise
under
the
compensation
clause
when
the
statute
says,
he
shall
receive
a
salary,
as
adjusted.
that's
all
we're
saying
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
real
pay
acts
here,
not
potential
pay.
we're
talking
about
what
the
statutes
provide
for
judges'
compensation
and
salary.
in
the
remaining
few
minutes
i'd
like
to
make
some
comment
on
the
statutory
arguments.
although
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
i
want
to
make
it
as
clear
as
i
can
that
we
think
it's
imperative
that
the
court
reach
the
constitutional
questions
in
this
case
even
if
it
could
resolve
the
case
on
stat
xx
grounds,
because
we
think
this
kind
of
confrontation
should
come
to
an
end
and
the
one
way
to
bring
it
to
a
swift
end
is
to
have
once
and
for
all
a
judicial
determination
on
what
is
included
in
a
judge's
compensation
under
the
statutes
that
we
presently
have
in
effect.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
would
you
say
that
again,
justice
white,
the
years?
because
i'm
sometimes
in
quadrennial
and
at
times--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--okay.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
the
quadrennial
increase
went
into
effect
in
march,
1977.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
oh,
no.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--i
don't
think
that
that's
what
he
argued.
the--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--that's
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
on
july
12,
1977,
the
congress
adopted
a
statute
that
says,
adjust,
that
says
pay
increases
that
would
otherwise
go
into
effect
this
year
shall
not
take
effect.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
oh,
you're
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
the
quadrennial
increases
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
adjustments.
and
with
respect
to
that
act,
i
think
that
mr.
geller
stated
that
it
specifically
said,
increases
under
the
adjustment
act
shall
not
go
into
effect.
it
did
not.
it
did
not
refer
to
the
adjustment
act
at
all,
as
i
recall,
and
in
fact,
in
none
of
the
four
years
did
any
of
the
statutes
which
purported
to
withhold
these
limitations
did,
not
a
one
of
them
ever
mentioned
the
adjustment
act,
not
a
one
of
them
ever
stated
anything
about
specifically
repealing
the
adjustment
act
or
any
other
of
the
pay
acts
that
we
have
been
discussing
here
this
morning.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
that's
right.
we
did
that
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief,
too.
at
the
very
last
page
we
set
out
a
copy
of
a
memorandum
from
the
administrative
office
making
this
computation.
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
everybody
covered
by
the
executive
schedule.
that's
right,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
statutory
arguments...
and
so
long
as
the
act
of
july
12,
1977,
is
being
discussed,
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
that
act
comes
much
closer
to
substantive
legislation
than
the
others.
in
the
other
years
in
question--
mr.
kevin
m.
forde
--that's
right.
the
act
of
july
12,
1977,
was
not
an
appropriations
act.
the
other
three
were
appropriations
acts,
two
of
them
the
legislative
branch
appropriations
act,
the
third
one
this
joint
resolution
of
a
year
ago.
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
as
mr.
geller
suggests,
you'll
find
a
lot
of
discussion
about
what
they
intended
to
do.
nobody
said
word
one
about
repealing
the
adjustment
act.
all
they
were
concerned
about
was
taking
additional
compensation.
after
the
actions
of
congress
in
each
of
those
years,
in
all
three
of
the
years...
not
'77,
the
president
issued
an
executive
order
saying
the
rates
of
pay
for
judges
and
others...
congressmen
and
others,
are...
and
if
you
read
those
executive
orders,
we
cited
two
in
our
briefs,
there
is
a
third
one
for
the
third
year,
he
shows
the
pay
as
adjusted.
and
then
he
has
a
footnote
saying,
funds
are
not
available.
so
he
did
not
think
in
those
years
that
congress
was
enacting
substantive
legislation.
the
comptroller
general
didn't
think
that
congress
was
enacting
substantive
legislation.
before
they
did
it
the
first
time
the
chairman
of
the
committee
asked
for
an
opinion
by
the
comptroller
general
and
the
comptroller
general
said,
if
you
do
it
this
way,
you
will
not
be
affecting
the
statutory
rates
of
pay,
you
will
only
be
withholding
funds.
you
will
not
be
eliminating
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
pay
the
salary.
you
just
will
not
have
funds
available
to
pay
them
at
this
time.
after
having
before
them...
after...
the
comptroller
general's
opinion,
they
did
it
by
just
limiting
the
funds.
and
nobody
in
the
record
said,
we
disagree
with
the
opinion.
in
other
words,
the
solicitor
says,
well,
the
congress
obviously
disagreed
with
the
comptroller
general's
opinion
in
that
regard,
but
nobody
said
they
did.
the
office
of
personnel
management
issued
a
memorandum
last
year
saying,
in
their
opinion
the
limitations
did
not
eliminate
the
statutory
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
pay
the
adjusted
salary.
the
statute
books...
if
you
look
in
the
statute
books,
i
believe
it's
6
u.s.
c
5332...
list
judges'
pay
and
congressmen
and
others
as
adjusted.
then
there's
a
footnote,
funds
not
available
to
pay.
you
pick
up
the
handbook,
west
publishing
company
handbook
that's
on
the
desk
of
every
district
judge
in
the
country,
if
he
opens
up
to
28
u.s.
135
today,
he'll
see
in
there
a
footnote
as
to
judges'
salary,
and
the
footnote
says
that
his
pay
is
something
substantially
more
than
he's
receiving,
i
forget
the
exact
amount
that's
in
the
current
issue
of
west's.
and
then
a
footnote,
funds
not
available
to
pay.
so,
if
the
congressional
history
is
so
clear
that
they
were
enacting
substantive
legislation,
a
lot
of
people
don't
realize
it.
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
your
honors
for
the
time
and
the
courtesy
this
morning.
we
urge
that
the
court
would
affirm
on
both
appeals
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
thank
you
very
much.
