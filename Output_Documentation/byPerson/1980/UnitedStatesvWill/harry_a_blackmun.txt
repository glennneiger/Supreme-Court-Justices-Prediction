and
that
can
be
downward

maybe
there
others
that
haven't
come
to
our
attention.
mr.
geller,
it
isn't
in
the
record,
of
course,
but
didn't
exactly
the
same
thing
happen
two
weeks
ago?
justice
blackmun
well,
what
are
you
saying?
that
you
couldn't
get
personal
jurisdiction
over
mr.
foley?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
was
a
law
clerk
in
1933.
four
months
after
i
started
my
salary
was
reduced
and
my
judge
whose
salary
was
not
affected
never
let
me
forget
it.
and
i
thought
it
was
discriminatory.
