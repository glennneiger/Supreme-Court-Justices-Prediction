mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
consolidated
cases
are
direct
appeals
by
the
government
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
declared
unconstitutional
four
acts
of
congress
that
were
passed
in
consecutive
years
between
1976
and
1979
to
hold
down
or
eliminate
annual
cost-of-living
salary
increases
for
all
high-ranking
federal
officials,
including
the
vice
president,
members
of
congress,
cabinet
and
sub-cabinet
officials
in
the
executive
branch,
and
federal
judges.
the
district
judge
held
that
to
the
extent
these
pay
freeze
statutes
applied
to
judges,
they
violated
the
compensation
clause
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
the
district
court
also
held
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
the
statutes
were
not
intended
by
congress
to
be
substantive
legislation.
that
is,
they
were
not
intended
to
wipe
out
the
federal
officials'
entitlement
to
a
cost-of-living
increase
but
were
instead
only
appropriations
measures
that
refused
to
provide
the
money
for
salary
increases
required
by
law.
the
government
in
these
appeals
has
challenged
each
of
these
holdings.
before
setting
forth
the
facts
that
led
to
these
lawsuits
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
begin
by
briefly
explaining
the
somewhat
complicated
mechanism
by
which
the
pay
of
federal
judges
is
determined.
for
the
first
180
years
of
our
nation's
history,
judicial
salaries
were
fixed
by
congress
essentially
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
during
this
period
congress
raised
the
salaries
of
supreme
court
justices
on
12
occasions
and
raised
the
salaries
of
lower
court
judges
on
nine
occasions.
congress
finally
changed
this
system
in
1967
by
passing
the
federal
salary
act.
under
this
act
the
salaries
of
federal
judges
as
well
as
the
vice
president,
members
of
congress,
cabinet
officers,
and
selected
other
high
level
officials
are
reviewed
by
a
blue
ribbon
commission
every
four
years
to
determine
appropriate
pay
levels.
this
commission
reports
its
findings
to
the
president
who
must
submit
to
congress
in
his
next
budget
message
recommendations
for
the
exact
rate
of
pay
for
these
officials,
and
then
within
60
days
both
houses
of
congress
must
vote
on
the
president's
recommendations.
the
first
federal
salary
act
review
took
place
in
fiscal
year
1969
and
the
review
process
has
occurred
every
four
years
since
then.
in
fact,
just
last
week
the
membership
of
the
fiscal
1981
review
commission
was
announced
and
that
commission
is
scheduled
to
make
its
report
to
the
president
on
increases
in
judicial
and
other
salaries
by
the
end
of
this
calendar
year.
now,
the
federal
salary
act
contains
no
mechanism
for
annual
adjustments
of
salaries
of
the
officials
covered
by
that
act.
rather,
the
only
means
specified
in
the
salary
act
for
modifying
such
salaries
is
the
quadrennial
review
process.
in
an
attempt
to
remedy
this
problem
congress
in
1975
passed
the
executive
salary
cost-of-living
adjustment
act.
this
act
applies,
by
and
large,
to
the
officials
covered
by
the
federal
salary
act,
including
federal
judges.
now,
under
the
adjustment
act
judicial
salaries
are
subject
to
an
annual
increase
equal
to
the
annual
percentage
cost-of-living
increase
given
to
civil
service
employees
in
that
year,
pursuant
to
yet
another
statute,
the
federal
pay
comparability
act
of
1970.
under
the
comparability
act
the
president
each
year
must
designate
a
pay
agent
to
compare
civil
service
salaries
with
the
rates
of
pay
for
the
same
levels
of
work
in
private
industry.
following
the
study
the
pay
agent
submits
his
report
to
the
president
along
with
a
recommendation
of
appropriate
adjustments
in
civil
service
rates
of
pay.
after
considering
this
report
the
president
has
two
options.
first,
he
can
inform
congress
that
he
agrees
with
and
adopts
the
agent's
recommendation,
in
which
event
the
recommended
cost-of-living
increase
automatically
goes
into
effect
as
of
the
first
pay
period
after
october
1st
of
that
year.
on
the
other
hand,
if
because
of
a
national
emergency
or
economic
conditions
affecting
the
general
welfare
the
president
believes
that
the
pay
agent's
recommendations
are
too
high,
the
president
may
reject
the
pay
agent's
recommendation
and
submit
an
alternative
pay
raise
plan
to
congress.
if
neither
house
of
congress
disapproves
the
president's
alternative
plan,
it
goes
into
effect
on
the
first
pay
period
after
october
1st.
however,
if
the
house
or
the
senate
disapproves
the
president's
alternative
plan
within
30
days,
then
the
original
recommendation
of
the
pay
agent
goes
into
effect
for
civil
service
employees.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
president's
recommendation
could
conceivably
be
downwards,
and
generally
it
is
downwards
rather
than
upward.
now,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
adjustment
act
ties
the
cost-of-living
increases
of
high-ranking
federal
officials
including
federal
judges
to
the
average
cost-of-living
increase
given
to
civil
servants
under
the
comparability
act.
in
addition
the
adjustment
act
specifies
the
effective
date
of
any
such
adjustment
for
judges
as
of
october
1st
of
each
year.
so,
to
summarize,
judicial
pay
is
determined
by
reference
to
three
separate
statutes.
there
is
the
federal
salary
act
which
sets
a
base
pay
for
judges
with
a
review
of
that
base
every
four
years.
and
then
there's
the
adjustment
act
which
provides
that
judges
may
get
an
annual
cost-of-living
increase
measured
by
the
cost-of-living
increase
given
to
civil
service
employees
under
the
comparability
act,
and
the
adjustment
act
increase
goes
into
effect...
if
there
is
one...
on
october
1st
of
the
year.
now,
the
first
year
the
adjustment
act
was
in
effect
was
1975,
and
in
october,
1975,
civil
service
salaries
were
increased
by
an
average
of
five
percent
pursuant
to
the
comparability
act.
and
as
a
result,
federal
judges
and
other
officials
covered
by
the
adjustment
act
received
a
like
increase.
the
events
that
led
to
these
lawsuits
began
in
the
fall
of
1976.
in
october,
1976,
the
salaries
of
civil
service
employees
were
increased
by
an
average
of
4.8
percent
under
the
comparability
act.
on
september
22,
1976,
however,
the
house
and
senate
passed
a
bill
which
was
signed
by
the
president
on
october
1st
providing
that
none
of
the
funds
appropriated
in
any
statute
could
be
used
to
pay
the
salary
of
any
official
covered
by
the
adjustment
act
at
a
rate
that
exceeded
the
salary
in
effect
for
that
official
on
september
30th,
1976.
in
other
words,
this
statute
which
we've
referred
to
in
this
litigation
as
the
1976
pay
act
prevented
the
1976
adjustment
act
increases
from
taking
effect
for
federal
judges
and
a
number
of
other
high
level
officials.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
tucker
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
would
be
some
question
whether
judges
would
have
a
right
to
sue
because
they're
claiming
under
the
compensation
clause
of
the
constitution.
just
like,
for
example,
the
just
compensation
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment
might
well
require
that
congress
provide
some
judicial
remedy,
but
it's
certainly
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
we
have
not
challenged
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
it
clearly
falls
under
28
u.s.c.
1346
(a)(2).
now,
in
each
of
the
next
three
years
after
1976
congress
passed
a
separate
pay
act
to
limit
or
eliminate
the
anticipated
adjustment
act
increase
for
that
year.
in
july
1977
congress
passed
the
1977
pay
act
which
provided
that
the
cost-of-living
increases
that
would
have
become
effective
in
october,
1977,
"shall
not
take
effect".
the
reason
congress
did
this
was
because
in
march
of
1977
the
officials
covered
by
the
adjustment
act
had
received
their
quadrennial
salary
increase
pursuant
to
the
salary
act.
federal
judges,
for
example,
had
gotten
a
pay
raise
of
almost
30
percent
under
the
salary
act
in
march,
1977,
and
there
was
substantial
sentiment
in
congress
that
high-ranking
federal
officials
should
not
get
two
pay
increases
in
the
course
of
a
single
year.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
actually,
i
was
just
referring
to
the
1977
legislation
which
wiped
out--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
became...
march
of
'77,
that's
right.
now
in
october
of
1977
civil
service
employees
got
a
7.2
percent
increase
under
the
comparability
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
that
is
in
this
case.
that
is
count
1
of
the
will
i.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
set
a
new
base
salary
level
for
judges.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
no.
the
only
bearing
that
the
4.8
percent
has
in
this
litigation
now
is,
if
appellees
are
correct
that
congress
could
not
wipe
out
the
4.8
percent
then
the
judges
would
be
entitled
to
back
pay
for
the
period
from
october
1,
1976.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
what
congress
meant
to
eliminate
in
light
of
the
30
percent
increase
judges
got
was
the
7.2
percent
salary
increase--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
only
in
the
sense
that
the
base
salary
had
been
paid.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
but
there
are
a
number
of
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that
talk
about
superseding
the
7.2
percent
that
was
going
to
become
effective
in
october
of
'77
because
it
would
have
been
two
salary
increases
in
one
year.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
only
became
effective
in
march,
1977.
what
it
does
wipe
out
is
any
claim
that
judges
have
to
a
new
base
salary
level
based
on
the
4.8
percent,
but
what
it
doesn't
wipe
out
is
back
pay
for
the
period
october
1,
1976,
to
march,
1977.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
they
were
entitled
to
it.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
as
far
as
base
salary
levels
are
concerned--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
only
relevance
it
has
to
this
lawsuit
is
the
back
pay
issue.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
as
a
continuing
matter.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
that
is
the
relevance
in
this
lawsuit.
it's
simply
a
matter
of
back
pay,
it's
not
a
question
of
increasing
base
salary
levels
because
that
was
accomplished
in
march,
1977,
with
the
salary
act
increase.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
as
if
the
current
salary,
the
current
quadrennial
review
process
that's
now
beginning
will
set
a
new
salary
level
for
judges,
presumably,
unless
the
president
or
congress
doesn't
go
along
with
the
recommendations.
it
will
set
a
new
salary
level
for
judges
as
of
march
or
april,
1981,
and
therefore
all
of
these
prior
pay
acts
will
be
relevant
only
in
terms
of
back
pay
and
not
in
terms
of
setting
a
new
salary
level
for
judges--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--providing
that
it
is,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
just
sets
the
base
salary
for
district
judges.
there's
a
separate
statute
that
sets
the
salary
for
each
level
of
the
federal
judiciary,
section
135
is
for
district
judges,
and
what
it
does
is,
it
has
two
components.
it
says
a
base
salary,
plus,
you
know,
the
adjustment
act
increase
the
base
salaries,
the
salary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right.
as
i
said,
there
are
two
components
to
judicial
salary.
one
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
that
is
the
statute
that
sets
forth
the
components
of
a
judge's
salary
and
it
refers
to
other
statutes.
it
refers
to
the
federal
salary
act
and
it
refers
to
the
adjustment
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
don't
even
mention
that
because
there's
a
separate
statute
for
each
branch
of
the
federal
judiciary,
and
all
it
does
is
relate
how
all
the
other
statutes
work.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
there
is
a
separate
statute
in
that
event
for
each
judge.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
the
salary
that
a
district
judge
gets
as
provided
in
section
135.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
circuit
judges,
supreme
court
justices,
and
for
other
parts
of
the
federal
judiciary.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
the
language
is
similar.
well,
just
to
finish
up
the
statement
of
facts,
in
september
of
1978
congress
eliminated
a
5.5
percent
pay
raise
for
adjustment
act
employees
that
would
have
gone
into
effect
on
october
1st
of
that
year.
and
last
year,
on
october
12,
1979,
congress
reduced
the
adjustment
act
increase
for
fiscal
year
1980
from
12.9
percent
to
5.5
percent.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
except
for
the...
it's
repeated
in
all
of
the
statutes
except
in
the
1977
statute
which
is
not
part
of
an
appropriations
act
at
all
and
simply
says
that
the
october,
1977,
adjustment
act
increases
shall
not
take
effect.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
the
1979.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
the
'76
act
was
signed
on
october
1st.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
sometime
on
october
1st.
i
don't
know
what
time
of
day
it
was
signed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
assume
that
it
was
not
signed
substantially
after--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
is
a
question--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
correct.
there
is
a
question
which
i
would
hope
to
get
to
a
little
bit
later
of
what
the
effect
is
of
the
bills
that
took
the...
the
act
that
took
effect
on
october
1st?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
12.9
percent.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
and
there's
no
question
in
this
case
about
the
judges'
entitlement
to
the
12.9
percent
for
the
12
days.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
or
for
any
other
part
of
the
executive
branch
although,
just
to
complicate
matters
further
for
officials
other
than
judges,
salary
doesn't
take
effect
on
october
1st
but
on
the
first
pay
period
after
october
1st.
so
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--appellees
representing
the
classes
of
federal
judges
affected
by
these
pay
acts
brought
these
actions
under
the
tucker
act
in
february,
1978,
and
october,
1979.
the
first
suit
which
we've
referred
to
as
will
i
challenged
the
1976
and
1977
pay
acts
as
reducing
judicial
compensation
in
violation
of
the
compensation
clause.
in
the
second
suit,
which
has
been
referred
to
as
will
ii,
presented
the
identical
challenge
to
the
1978
and
1979
pay
acts.
the
district
court
agreed
with
appellees
and
declared
all
four
statutes
unconstitutional.
according
to
the
district
court,
once
the
adjustment
act
became
law
in
1975,
then
the
right
to
an
annual
cost
of
living
increase
measured
by
the
average
cost-of-living
adjustment
given
to
civil
servants
under
the
comparability
act
became
part
of
the
judges'
compensation
which
may
never
thereafter
be
diminished
or
eliminated.
in
addition,
as
i
noted
earlier,
the
district
judge
also
concluded
as
an
alternative
holding
that
the
pay
acts
were
merely
appropriations
measures
that
refused
to
fund
but
did
not
wipe
out
the
adjustment
act
increases
for
each
of
the
four
years
in
question.
the
united
states
believes
that
each
of
these
holdings
is
incorrect
but
before
i
discuss
what
we
view
as
the
errors
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
there
are
two
procedural
matters
that
the
court
has
directed
the
parties
to
address.
the
first
is
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
postponed
consideration
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
but
we
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
this
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
1252.
the
district
court
held
unconstitutional
several
acts
of
congress
in
a
civil
action
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
hence,
a
direct
appeal
lies
to
this
court
under
section
1252.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
had
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i'm
now
going
to
get
to
the
question
of
his
qualifications.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
assuming
he
was
disqualified,
we
don't
view
the
question
of
disqualification
as
jurisdictional
in
nature.
the
district
court
clearly
had
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
our
view.
we
don't
view
the
recusal
statute
as
being
jurisdictional
in
nature.
the
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction,
although
there
may
be
a
separate
question
as
to
which
judge
of
that
court
should
hear
the
case.
now,
as
i
said,
a
somewhat
related
question
concerns
the
disqualification
of
the
members
of
this
court
and
the
district
court.
these
cases
obviously
directly
involve
the
pay
of
federal
judges.
moreover,
each
of
the
justices
of
this
court
is
a
member
of
the
plaintiff
classes
certified
by
the
district
judge
in
will
i
and
will
ii,
and
the
district
judge
was
himself
a
member
of
the
certified
class
in
will
ii.
therefore,
we
believe
it's
clear
that
the
members
of
this
court
and
the
district
judge
technically
have
a
disqualifying
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
judicial
recusal
statute,
28
u.s.c.
455.
nonetheless,
all
the
parties
and
amici
agree
that
this
is
an
appropriate
instance
for
invoking
the
so-called
rule
of
necessity.
every
currently
sitting
federal
judge,
whether
or
not
a
class
member,
has
a
direct
and
immediate
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
these
cases
and
would
therefore
seem
to
be
equally
disqualified
under
28
u.s.c.
455
(b)(4).
in
these
circumstances
we
believe
the
court
as
it
did
a
half-century
ago
in
the
income
tax
cases
can
and
should
decide
these
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
and
it
is,
i
think
clearly
within
the
judicial
recusal
statute
that...
this
situation.
not
only
do
the
justices
of
this
court
have
a
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
these
cases,
but
by
virtue
of
the
district
judge's
certification
of
the
classes,
each
member
of
this
court
is
a
party
to
the
litigation,
which
is
a
separate
disqualifying
factor
under
the
statute.
we
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
among
the
parties
or
amici
that
the
judges
of
this
court
technically
are
disqualified.
we
think,
however,
it's
a
clear
case
for
invocation
of
the
rule
of
necessity.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
my
understanding
is
that
when
every
judge
is
disqualified
from
hearing
a
case,
then
no
judge
is
disqualified
simply
by
virtue
of
the
disqualifying
factor.
i
should
add
the
obvious
that
if
any
justice
feels
that
he
can't
personally
sit
on
this
case
because
he
cannot
be
impartial,
then
that
justice
individually
should
make
the
decision
to
disqualify
himself.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
justices
of
this
court
are
disqualified
simply
because
they
fall
within
one
of
the
disqualifying
factors--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
separate
question
presented--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
is
precious
little
discussion
in
the
history
of
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
think
it
would
have
been
quite
remarkable
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
abrogate
the
rule
of
necessity
without
saying
so.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
we
think
that
it
survives.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
were
previous
judicial
recusal
statutes
before
section
455
and
the
rule
of
necessity
was
applied
to
them.
we
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history
or
the
language
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
it
is
a
common
law
rule
which
congress
has
not
abrogated.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
excuse
me.
again?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it's
a
well
recognized
exception
that
was
read
into
all
the
previous
judicial
recusal
statutes,
and,
yes,
i
think
the
court
should
do
the
same
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
would
depend,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
why
the
court
decided
that
the
members
of
this
court
were
disqualified.
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
the
rule
of
necessity
has
been
abrogated
and
that
every
federal
judge
now
on
the
bench
is
equally
disqualified
and
that
no
one
can
hear
this
case,
then
we
think
that
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
for
this
court
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
who
was
also
equally
disqualified.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
under
the
same
rationale
that
allows
this
court
to
determine
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
or
even
in
cases
where
the
court
clearly
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
because
the
issue
is
moot.
for
example,
the
court
sometimes
sends
the
case
back
to
have
the
judgment
vacated
even
though
technically
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
now,
however,
i
should
add
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
correct,
and
why
i
think
i'm
consistent
in
saying
that
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
vacate
that
judgment.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
every
judge
is
disqualified
there's
no
reason
to
leave
that
judgment
outstanding.
however,
there's
another
possibility
here
which
i
should
mention,
and
that
is,
the
members
of
this
court
may
feel
that
they
are
disqualified
because
they
are
parties
to
this
litigation.
now,
not
every
federal
judge
now
on
the
bench
is
a
party
to
this
litigation.
a
judge
who
was
appointed
after
october
12,
1979,
would
not
be
a
member
of
any
of
the
certified
classes.
now,
28
u.s.c.
2109
allows
this
court
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
quorum,
because
more
than
four
justices
are
disqualified,
to
remit
the
case
to
the
appropriate
circuit
to
be
heard
by
a
panel
of
that
circuit,
and
finally
determined.
so
if
this
court
decides
that
the
rule
of
necessity
does
apply
but
that
the
justices
of
this
court
have
a
special
disqualification
because
they're
members
of
a
class,
then
i
suppose
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
7th
circuit
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
panel
composed
of
judges
who
were
appointed
after
october
12,
1979.
but
nobody
has
suggested
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
would
still
have
a
stake
in
the
case
but
they
wouldn't
have
this
additional
disqualification.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that's
why
we
think
this
court
should
decide
the
case.
but
the
members
of
this
court
have
two
disqualifications;
there
are
members
of
the
federal
judiciary
now
who
only
have
one
disqualification.
if
that
is
deemed
relevant
by
this
court,
then
there
is
the
option
of
sending
it
back
to
the
7th
circuit.
i'd
like
to
turn,
then,
to
the
statutory
basis
for
the
district
court's
holding.
the
court's
statutory
determination
is
extremely
important
for
two
reasons.
first,
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
district
court
that
the
appellees
had
a
statutory
right
to
their
cost-of-living
increases
over
the
past
four
years,
then
there
will
be
no
need
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
the
pay
acts.
second,
the
district
judge's
statutory
holding
affects
a
great
many
federal
employees
other
than
judges.
if
the
district
court
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
then
not
only
judges
but
about
2,000
other
federal
employees
covered
by
the
adjustment
act
would
have
gotten
salary
raises
in
each
of
the
last
four
years.
and,
in
addition,
some
20,000
civil
servants
whose
pay
is
subject
to
a
statutory
ceiling
pegged
to
the
lowest
executive
schedule
salary
level
would
also
be
entitled
to
receive
back
pay,
because
the
ceiling
would
have
been
raised
in
each
of
the
last
four
years.
these
combined
pay
increases
would
total
several
hundred
million
dollars.
in
light
of
these
two
important
considerations,
the
district
court's
treatment
of
the
statutory
issue
is
somewhat
remarkable.
the
issue
is
discussed
in
a
single
paragraph
at
the
very
end
of
its
opinion
in
will
i.
the
court
merely
states
that
none
of
the
pay
acts
contains
any
language
indicating
that
it
was
intended
to
be
anything
more
than
an
appropriation
statute.
but
the
1977
pay
act,
at
least,
was
not
an
appropriation
statute
at
all,
and
while
the
other
three
pay
acts
were
part
of
appropriations
bills,
this
court
has
made
clear
on
several
occasions
that
congress
if
it
wants
to
can
suspend
or
repeal
substantive
legislation
in
an
appropriations
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
a
term
that
was
coined
for
the
purpose
of
litigation
but
not...
it's
a
convenient
shorthand.
each
of
these
acts
has
a
very
long
name.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
didn't
do
it
for
any
tactical
litigation
purpose,
but
it
is
something
that
we
have
been
using
since
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--not
a
term,
although
i
think
in
some
of
those
later
statutes
the
term
did
start
to
work
its
way
into
the
legislative
history,
but
it's
not
a
term
in
the
statute
itself.
anyway,
as
the
court
said
in
belknap,
the
whole
question
depends
on
the
intention
of
congress
as
to
whether
an
appropriation
statute
was
intended
to
amend
or
repeal
substantive
legislation.
now,
the
district
court's
decision
does
not
discuss
the
language,
the
legislative
history,
or
the
purpose
of
any
of
the
pay
acts.
we
have
in
our
brief
set
forth
this
legislative
history
in
exhaustive
detail,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
serve
any
purpose
for
me
to
repeat
any
of
that
history
here,
but
i
doubt
that
anyone
can
read
the
statements
of
the
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
statement
after
statement
and
pay
act
after
pay
act,
without
concluding
that
congress
unquestionably
intended
to
prohibit
the
adjustment
act
increases
from
going
into
effect.
there
are
repeated
references
to
a
pay
freeze
or--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--for
that
year;
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
to
which
it
was
addressed;
that's
correct.
there
are
repeated
references
to
a
pay
freeze,
or
to
a
pay
cap,
or
to
a
desire
to
supersede
or
rescind
the
cost
of
living
increases
for
the
year
in
question.
there's
virtually
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
record
to
the
contrary.
in
fact,
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
pay
acts
was
to
hold
down
the
pay
of
high-ranking
federal
officials,
largely
as
an
anti-inflation
measure,
it
would
have
defeated
congress's
express
objectives
if
the
pay
acts
had
simply
been
limitations
on
expenditures.
what
this
would
have
meant
is
that
congress
in
four
consecutive
years
merely
wanted
to
withhold
funds
necessary
to
meet
the
government's
acknowledged
obligations
under
the
adjustment
act,
but
to
leave
those
substantive
obligations
intact,
knowing
full
well
that
those
obligations
could
be
enforced
in
court.
neither
the
district
judge
nor
appellees
have
offered
any
plausible
explanation
why
congress
would
repeatedly
have
engaged
in
such
a
senseless
and
futile
exercise.
now,
if
this
court
agrees
that
the
pay
acts
were
intended
to
be
substantive
legislation,
then
the
question
remains
whether
that
legislation
is
constitutional.
the
compensation
clause
analysis
essentially
involves
two
separate
inquiries.
first,
were
judicial
salaries
diminished
in
the
constitutional
sense
by
the
pay
acts?
and
second,
if
a
diminishment
occurred,
was
it
the
sort
of
reduction
prohibited
by
article
iii?
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
1976,
1977,
and
1978
pay
acts
did
not
diminish
appellees'
compensation
because
at
the
time
these
statutes
were
enacted,
the
annual
cost-of-living
adjustments
allowed
by
the
adjustment
act
had
not
yet
gone
into
effect.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
oh,
yes;
we've
said
that
in
the
brief,
that
it's
a
reduction
in
compensation
there
although
there's
still--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--a
second
question
as
to
whether
it's
constitutional.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
1976.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
cases
in
this
court
hold
that
the
general
rule
in
construing
legislation
is
that
the
courts
will
not
inquire
into
the
time
of
day
that
the
bill
was
signed,
that
it
will
be
presumed
to
take
effect
as
of
the
first
moment
of
the
day.
now,
appellees
correctly
point
out
that
there
is
an
exception
to
this
rule;
where
substantial
justice
so
requires,
the
courts
will
inquire
into
the
fractions
of
the
day.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
one
of
the
many
cases--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
right,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
we
don't
think
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
substantial
justice
requires
the
court
to
inquire
into
the
time
of
day
that
the
act
was
passed.
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
to
pass
the
1976
pay
act
before
october
1st.
it
passed
both
houses
of
congress
on
september
22.
the
president
didn't
sign
it
until
october
1st
only
because
no
one
really
thought
it
was
crucial
that
he
do
so.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
"substantial
justice".
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
what
the
court
should
take
into
account.
we
think
that
appellees'
hypertechnical
argument
here
does
not
entitle
them
to
use
of
this
exception
to
substantial
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we're
not
talking
here
about
the
base
salaries
that
judges
are
entitled
to.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
what
i'm
talking
about,
if
the
court
decides
that
the
congress
can
supersede
adjustment
act
increases
if
it
acts
before
those
increases
go
into
effect,
and
if
it
decides
that
those
increases
go
into
effect
on
october
1
of
each
year
as
the
statute
so
requires,
then
it
would
seem
to
us
not
to
require
resort
to
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
order
to
save
the
1976
pay
increases
to
judges.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
some
metaphysical
sense.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
true,
and
at
5
o'clock--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
they
deal
with
questions--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
was
important
to
determine
when
an
act
took
effect.
the
court
has
said
that
the
test
is
that
it
takes
effect
as
of
the
first
moment
of
the
day
unless
substantial
justice--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
some
of
those
cases,
i
believe,
did
involve
constitutional
questions.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
have
to,
while
my
opponent
is
speaking
give
you
the
names,
but
they
involve
questions
where
penalties
were
imposed
by
statutes--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
1980
pay
act
was
passed
on
october
1st,
that's
correct.
well,
that's
after--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
was
both.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
the
'76
pay
act
was
passed
well
before
october
1st.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
that's
correct.
i
think
the
president
this
year,
and
congress
this
year,
could
have
thought
they
could
act
until
october
1,
based
on
the
position
that
government
was
taking
in
these
cases.
appellees
contend
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question;
certainly
there's
no
question--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
don't
think
that
they
intended
that
the
1979
pay
act
apply
to
the
period
between
october
1
and
october
11.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
meant
to
imply,
i
think,
prospectively.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
are...
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
in
the
1979
pay
act
by
adding
in
this
waiver
language,
there's
not
much
legislative
history
either,
but
there
are
certain
statements
on
the
floor
by
representative
whitten
in
which,
what
he
says
is,
we
intend
the
1979
pay
act,
like
the
previous
three
pay
acts,
to
apply
substantively.
however,
there
is
some
question
in
light
of
judge
roszkowski's
decision
in
the
will
litigation
as
to
whether
we
can
do
that.
i
don't
think
there
should
have
been
any
question
on
the
part
of
congress,
but
representative
whitten
says
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
whether
we
can
act
substantively
in
an
appropriations
measure.
and
therefore,
let's
accomplish
that
purpose
essentially
by
means
of
a
settlement.
anyone
who
after
today
takes
the
5.5
percent
will
be
waiving
his
right
to
the
12.9
percent.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
talk
about
the
period
retroactively.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
it's
not
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
appellees
have
the
right--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--for
the
12
days,
they
would
not
be
waiving
their
right
to
the
12.9
percent
by
taking
5.5
percent.
there's
no
question
in
this
litigation
as
to
the
salary
level
for
that
11
days,
for
appellees.
it's
12.9
percent
above
the
previous
base
salary.
i
do
want
to
discuss
the
constitutional
point
a
little
bit
more
but
i
notice
that
i'm
almost
out
of
time
and
i
do
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
so
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
our
argument,
if
the
court
agrees
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
if
the
court
agrees
that
in
'76,
'77,
and
'78
congress
acted
to
withdraw
the
adjustment
act
increases
before
they
went
into
effect
and
that
that
is
not
a
diminution,
then
you
don't
have
to
reach--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no.
if
you
agree
with
my
opponents,
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--only
on
the
'79
act.
only
as
to
the
'79
act,
if
you
agree
with
our
opponents--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--as
to
the
'79
act
at
least,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
our
position
is,
as
you
correctly
stated,
justice
white,
that
the
correct
test,
the
test
that
this
court,
i
think,
set
forth
in
o'malley
against
woodrough,
is
whether
the
statute
is
meant
to
discriminate
against
article
iii
judges
or
to
undermine
their
independence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
does
not
violate
the
compensation
clause
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
clearly
thought
they
were
reducing
salaries
prospectively,
and
we
think
that
that
was
constitutional.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there's
a
statutory
question
as
to
whether
the
'79
act
applies
to
the
judges
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
then
you
have--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
is
correct.
in
'76
and
'79,
at
the
very
least.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
let
me
begin
by
correcting
a
misstatement
which
mr.
forde
just
made.
three
of
the
four
pay
acts
expressly
refer
to
the
adjustment
act.
the
citations
are
in
footnote
3
of
our
reply
brief.
second,
although
there
was
some
equivocation
in
his
answers,
i
think
that
the
salient
point
of
the
appellees'
argument
was
the
answer
that
mr.
forde
gave
to
justice
stevens'
question,
yes,
if
their
argument
is
accepted,
then
congress
could
not
repeal
the
adjustment
act
at
all.
although,
i
might
add,
they
do
concede,
as
i
think
they
have
to,
that
congress
could
repeal
either
on
a
one
year
basis
or
permanently
the
comparability
act,
which
would
leave
judges
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
these
pay
acts
have
left
them.
i
think
that
shows
the
technical
nature
of
the
arguments
that
appellees
are
making
here
today.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
our
view
is
that
they
could
refuse
to
give
it
to
anyone
under
the
adjustment
act.
we
don't
say
that
the
judges
don't--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
clearly
they
could
raise
up
all
the
salaries
under
the
comparability
act
and
do
as
they've
done
over
the
last
four
years
and
say,
no
one
under
the
adjustment
act
can
get
any
raises.
now,
the
question
is
not
raised
in
this
case
and
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
question,
if
congress
singled
out
judges
in
the
pay
acts.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
let's
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
yes,
but
let
me,
let's
not
confuse
two
things.
first,
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
there's
a
diminution
at
all.
we
take
the
position--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right.
so
long
as
congress
acts--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--exactly;
that's
right.
but
once,
of
course,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
argument
and
finds
that
the
salaries
have
been
increased,
then
we
don't
contend
that
congress
can
discriminate
against
judges
in
reducing
salaries.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
they
act--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes;
if
they
act
before
the
adjustment
act
increases
go
into
effect,
we
claim
there
hasn't
been
a
diminution
in
compensation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no
question
that
that
would
not
violate
the
compensation
clause.
in
fact,
as
the
court
knows,
originally
the
compensation
clause
prevented
increases
as
well
as
decreases
in
judicial
compensation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
originally
the
draft,
proposed
draft
of
the
compensation
clause.
that's
correct.
and
over
the
objections
of
people
such
as
james
madison
the
prohibition
on
increases
was
taken
out.
it
was
left
to
congress
to
decide
whether--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--whether
or
not
to
increase
judicial
salaries
is
a
question
that
the
framers
explicitly
decided
to
leave
to
congress.
now,
the
adjustment
act,
we
submit,
creates
a
useful
system
whereby
judges
may
get
an
automatic
cost-of-living
increase
every
year.
but
there's
no
indication
that
in
passing
the
statute
congress
intended
to
surrender
its
ultimate
authority
granted
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
raise
or
to
refuse
to
raise
salaries
of
all
federal
officials
including
federal
judges.
indeed,
we
think
the
fact
that
the
congress
that
passed
the
adjustment
act
was
the
very
same
congress
that
less
than
a
year
later
passed
the
1976
pay
act,
so
i
don't
think
that
they
thought
that
by
trying
to
search
for
a
better
mechanism
to
deal
with
judicial
pay
they
were
freezing
into
the
constitution
this
adjustment
act
procedure
and
binding
all
future
congresses
never
to
be
able
to
refuse
to
allow
increases
to
go
into
effect.
may
i
just--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--make
one
additional
point?
the
analogy
that
you
raised,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
is
accurate,
where
congress
says
judges
shall
get
$65,000,
because
those
salaries
will
have
gone
into
effect.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
it's
not
a
diminution
once
they've
gone
into
effect.
i
think
the
proper
analogy
would
be
if
congress
today
were
to
say,
in
the
year
2000
judges
shall
get
$100,000
a
year.
the
question
is
if,
in
1990,
congress
were
to
repeal
that
statute,
is
that
a
diminution
of
compensation?
and
we
say
the
answer
is,
no.
thank
you.
