we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
79-983,
united
states
v.
will,
and
79-1689,
united
states
v.
will.
mr.
geller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
language
is
mandatory,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
all
the
members
of
this
court
were
disqualified
under
455,
what
would
be
the
consequence
in
terms
of
the
judgments
that
you're
asking
to
be
reviewed?
would
they
stand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we're
disqualified
to
sit,
how
can
we
decide
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
told
us
at
the
outset
that
this
is
not
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
i
thought?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
whether
justice
requires
it...
was
that
the
term?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
"substantial
justice".
--do
you
take
into
account
the
equities
of
the
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
the
court
then
be
permitted
to
take
into
account
that
a
united
states
district
judge's
salary
today
is
less
than
half
by
far
of
the
purchasing
power
in
terms
of
1969
dollars?
is
that
the
kind
of
inequity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but,
you
speak
of
equities.
what...
i'm
puzzled
as
to
what
kind
of
equities
you
have
in
mind
if
that
isn't
one
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
forde.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
solution
there
would
be
that
the
property
would
go
back
to
the
owner,
the
original
owner,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
person
in
the
condemnation
case...
i'll
put
it
as
a
question...
could
he
go
out
and
levy
on
the
white
house
or
execute
his
judgment?
i
wouldn't
think
so,
would
you?
chief
justice
burger
so,
the
taking
would
be
declared
by
the
court
to
be
void
at
some
point
if
congress
didn't
pay
the
constitutionally
required
compensation.
is
that
not
the
solution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
geller,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
number
79-983,
united
states
against
will
and
79-1689
united
states
against
will
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
with
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part
in
both
cases.
in
both
cases,
we
remand
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
this
morning.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
these
cases.
