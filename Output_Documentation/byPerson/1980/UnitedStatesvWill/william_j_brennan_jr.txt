justice
jr.
now,
this
deals
with
the
4.8
that
might
otherwise
have
become
effective
on
october
1...
what?
1976?
justice
jr.
well,
the
29-whatever-that-percentage-was,
that
became
effective
when?
march
of
'77?
justice
jr.
well,
do
we
have
any
case
here
that
involves
the
4.8-whatever-that-percentage-was,
effective
in
october
of
'76,
or
is
that--
justice
jr.
--and
you
just
said
that
the
increase
in
29-whatever-it-was
that
became
effective
in
march
of
'77--
justice
jr.
--what
bearing
did
that
have
on
the
4.8?
justice
jr.
and
in
doing
that
did
congress
supersede
whatever
the
increase
was,
the
4.8?
justice
jr.
what
you're
saying
is,
congress
meant
to
eliminate
that
4.8
in
light
of
the
29
that
became
effective
in
march,
'77?
justice
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
justice
jr.
and
it
had
no
bearing
on
the
4.8?
justice
jr.
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
did
congress
say
anything
in
respect
to
the
29-point...
that
it
was
supersede
any
of
the
4.8?
justice
jr.
all
right.
justice
jr.
mr.
geller,
let
me
get
this
clear.
you
did
just
say
that
the
4.8,
in
any
event,
in
light
of
the
29
percent
that
became
effective
in
march,
'77,
limited
the
4.8
to
the
period
from
october
1,
'76,
to
march,
'77?
justice
jr.
now,
is
that
the
act
that
was
signed
by
the
president
late
in
the
afternoon
of
october
1?
justice
jr.
i
know
that.
i
thought
you
mentioned
also
the
'77?
justice
jr.
and
was
signed
but...
sometime
later
in
the
day
of
october
1st?
justice
jr.
--and
that
presents
a
question
about
your--
justice
jr.
--under
the
diminution
clause
in
there.
justice
jr.
and
this
is
not
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
is
it?
justice
jr.
does
it
appear
that
congress
ever
addressed
this
question
when
they
drafted
that
455?
justice
jr.
and
certainly,
on
the
face
of
it,
it's
flat
and
mandatory
that--
justice
jr.
--then
you
are
suggesting
we
read
in
the
rule
of
necessity?
justice
jr.
imply
it
or
what?
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
are
saying
then
that
this
is
a
statutory
construction
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
matter,
does
it,
if
they
have
a
stake
in
the
case,
i
thought
455
was
mandatory
disqualification?
justice
jr.
--to
which
it
was
addressed.
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
geller,
whatever
the...
is
it
1977,
the
one
that
was
not
signed
until
late
in
the
day--
justice
jr.
--'76?
justice
jr.
what
about
that?
was
that
in
effect
at
midnight
of
october
1?
justice
jr.
that's
right.
now,
on
the
constitutional
argument,
those
of
us
who
don't
agree
with
you
as
to
when
the
'76
increase
became
effective
and
think
it
did
become
effective
at
midnight,
we
also--
justice
jr.
--have
to
raise
the
same
constitutional
question
as
we
have
for
'79.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
hearing
you.
justice
jr.
would
you
agree,
though,
that
the
judges'
recovery
is
limited
to
the
period
october
1,
'76,
to
march
'77,
when
the--
justice
jr.
--after
march
'77?
justice
jr.
haven't
we
enough
without
that?
