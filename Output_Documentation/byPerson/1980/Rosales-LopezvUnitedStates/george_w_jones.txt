mr.
george
w.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
explaining
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
charged
with
smuggling
illegal
aliens
into
the
united
states,
and
that
the
purpose
of
voir
dire
was
to
uncover
any
underlying
prejudices,
the
trial
court
specifically
asked
the
jurors
whether
any
of
them
had
any
feelings
about
aliens,
or
the
illegal
alien
problem.
it
seems
to
us
highly
unlikely
that
any
of
the
jurors
in
this
case
assumed
that
the
trial
court's
questions
excluded
mexican
aliens,
or
any
strong
feelings
they
might
have
had
about
the
mexican
illegal
alien
problem,
particularly
in
light
of
what
petitioner
refers
to
as
his
obvious
mexican
appearance.
mr.
george
w.
jones
we
don't
believe
that
circumstances
of
this
case
provide
any
substantial
basis
for
asking
any
more
than
what
the
trial
court--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--the
question
was
about
illegal
aliens.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well
if
the
trial
court
hadn't
asked
either
the
question
about
aliens
or
illegal
immigration,
it
would
be
a
much
closer
case.
but
since
the
trial
court
did
ask
those
questions,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
essentially
whether
petitioner's
proposed
question
would
have
been
significantly
more
effective
in
uncovering
bias
against
mexicans
than
the
question
the
trial
court
did
ask.
this
court's
cases
don't
suggest
that
questions
about
racial
bias
or
racial
prejudice,
need
to
be
put
in
any
particular
form,
in
ham
this
court
specifically
disclaimed
any
intention...
to
impose
such
a
requirement.
the
court's
questions
in
this
case
were
more
than
adequate
to
satisfy
both
the
constitutional
rule
and
the
federal
common
law
rule.
a
panel
of
jurors
drawn
from
the
southern
district
of
california
could
hardly
have
failed
to
understand
the
trial
judge's
questions
to
include
bias
against
mexican
aliens
and
any
strong
feelings
they
might
have
had
about
the
illegal
alien
problem,
illegal
mexican
alien
problems.
the
only
bias
that
wasn't
covered
by
the
questions
the
trial
court
asked,
only
conceivable
bias
that
wasn't
covered
is
bias
against
americans
with
mexican
ancestry.
petitioner
of
course,
was
not
an
american,
and
there's
no
reason
at
all
to
assume
that
the
jurors
in
this
case
would
have
been
biased
against
mexican
americans
but
not
mexican
aliens.
throughout
the
proceedings
in
the
courts
below,
the
petitioner...
and
in
fact,
in
this
court
as
well...
petitioner
argues
that
the
trial
court
was
obliged
to
ask
this
additional
question
only
because
this
court's
decisions
required
it.
neither
ham
nor
aldridge
nor
any
other
decision
of
this
court
purported
to
establish
a
per
se
rule
to
be
applied
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
ristaino,
of
course,
makes
it
plain
that
the
constitutional
rule
is...
the
constitutional
rule
is
triggered
only
if
race
or
racial
bias
is
inextricably
bound
up
with
the
issues
at
trial,
that
simply
wasn't
the
case
here.
the
federal
common
law
rule
announced
in
aldridge
requires
the
questions
specifically
directed
to
racial
bias
or
at
least
something
more
than
a
general
question
only
when
the
nature
of
the
offense
or
the
facts
of
the
case
suggest
that
there
is
a
strong
or
substantial
likelihood
that
racial
bias
will
affect
the
jury's
deliberations.
the
decision
in
aldridge
does
not
rest
on
the
assumption
that
only
a
question
specifically
mentioning
race
is
sufficient
to
uncover
racial
bias,
nor
does
it
rest
on
the
assumption
that
a
question
that
does
not
mention
race
is
necessarily
insufficient.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
questions
were
submitted
in
writing
prior
to
trial,
and
therefore
the
government
of
course
had
an
opportunity
to
object.
there's
no
indication
that
the
government
did
object,
however.
immediately
prior
to--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--right.
and
there
was
particularly
nothing
wrong
with
asking
the
question
in
light
of
the
questions
that
were
asked,
but
in
addition
to
that,
the
federal
common
law
rule
that
petitioner
relies
on
does
not
at
all
suggest
that
the
question
should
be
asked
whenever
the
defendant
requests
it,
but
only
when
the
likelihood
that
racial
bias
will
affect
the
jury's
deliberations
is
substantial.
in
ristaino,
this
court
made
it
fairly
clear
that
something
more
than
a
general
question
was
required,
but
the
rule
is
only
required
because
the
facts
indicate
a
need
for
it.
and
the
additional
protection
provided
by
asking
more
specific
questions
was
thought
necessary.
the
facts
of
both
ristaino
and
aldridge
underscore
the
point.
mr.
george
w.
jones
certainly
not.
as
i
said,
the
federal
common
law
rule
adopted
in
aldridge,
or
announced
in
aldridge,
only
requires
a
question
more
specific
than
a
general
question
when
the
facts
or
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
case
suggest
there
is
some
particularly
substantial
likelihood
that
racial
bias
will
be
a
factor
in
the
case
or
influence
the
jury's
deliberations.
there's
simply...
in
both
ristaino
and
aldridge,
black
defendants
were
charged
with
crimes
of
violence
directed
at
white
law
enforcement
officers.
in
aldridge
the
defendant
was
charged
with
murder,
and
in
ristaino,
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
in
cases
involving
crimes
of
interracial
violence,
the
danger
that
racial
prejudice
will
affect
the
deliberations
of
the
jury,
is
particularly
substantial
for
some
of
the
jurors
are
likely
to
identify
with
the
victim
and
view
the
case
as
us
against
them,
and
of
course,
crimes
of
violence
are
inherently
more
likely
to
evoke
strong
emotional
reactions
in
jurors
than
most
nonviolent
crimes.
the
petitioner's
attempt
in
this
court
and
in
his
brief
to
rely
on
the
relationship
with
bowling's
daughter,
is...
well,
comes
about
three
years
too
late.
in
the
district
court,
petitioner
said
nothing,
absolutely
nothing
to
the
district
judge
about
the
possibility
that
this
relationship
with
bowling's
daughter
would
be
mentioned
at
trial.
and
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
it's
the
duty
of
counsel
to
point
out
the
facts
which
will
support
a
request
for
a
specific
question.
having
failed
to
do
that,
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
rely
on
it
now.
but
even
if
petitioner
had
raised
the
point
in
the
district
court,
refusal
to
ask
the
question
in
this
case
would
not
have
constituted
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
there's
no
discretion
in
some
other
circuits.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case
we
might
be
petitioning
this
case.
but--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
as
petitioner
also
points
out--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--rules
24
suggests
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
rule
provides
that
the
court
may
allow
counsel
to
conduct
voir
dire,
may
itself
conduct
voir
dire,
if
the
court
conducts
voir
dire
it
should
allow
counsel
to
ask
supplemental
questions
or
submit
supplemental
questions
that
it
deems
proper.
mr.
george
w.
jones
right.
except
that,
it
says
shall
permit
counsel
to
submit
supplemental
questions.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
and
in
each
case,
the
trial
judge
as
rule
24
suggests,
should
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
determine
whether
there's
any
particular
need
for
the
kinds
of
questions
or
whether
as
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case,
questions
other
than
specific
questions
posed
by
counsel
were
sufficient.
mr.
george
w.
jones
certainly.
mr.
george
w.
jones
because
under
the
circumstances,
it
would
be
very
likely
that
jurors
would
find
his...
his
status
as
japanese--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--somewhat
offensive,
or
at
least
be
very
sensitive.
mr.
george
w.
jones
excuse
me?
mr.
george
w.
jones
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
two
questions
underscore
the
need
to
allow
the
trial
judge
and
the
district
courts
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
determine
whether
a
specific
question
is
necessary
or
not.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no.
mr.
george
w.
jones
excuse
me?
mr.
george
w.
jones
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
petitioner
isn't
arguing
for
constitutional--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--no.
it
seems
to
us
that--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--the
per
se
rule
is,
under
the
circumstances,
unnecessary
in
this
area.
and
it
would
cause
as
many
problems
as
it
would
resolve,
since
you
have
questions
like--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
think
they
are
arguing
that
there
is
a
per
se
rule,
at
least
as
to
supervisory
power,
and
that--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
think
that's...
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
your
interpretation.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well
there
are
constitutional
implications
to
that
question
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
deal
with
at
present.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
too
is
a
case
where
there
is
no
need
for
a
per
se
rule,
and
a
per
se
rule
would
be
completely
unnecessary,
or
inappropriate.
the
trial
judge,
looking
at
the
case...
the
defendant
says
well,
i
may
or
may
not
want
to
testify.
the
trial
judge
may
have
reservations
about
asking
questions
but
if
the
defendant
can
have
his
conviction
reversed
because
the
trial
court
refused
to
ask
the
question
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rule
is
charged
with
causing
more
problems
than
it
is
eliminating.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
standard
should
be
and
i
think,
is,
that
only
when
the
facts
of
the
case
or
the
nature
of
the
charge
suggest
that
there
is
some
substantial
likelihood
that
racial
bias
will
intrude
on
the
deliberations
of
the
jury.
mr.
george
w.
jones
a
closer
question,
your
honor.
but
still
a
question
of
judgment,
and
one
that
the
district
court
who
has
seen
the
answers
of
all
the
jurors
to
the
questions
asked
before,
is
in
a
much
better
position
to
answer
than
i
am.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
makes
absolutely
no
sense
to
assume
that
all
people
of
one
race
have
identical
feelings
about
any
particular
question
and--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--and
they
would
have
been--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--okay.
and
they
would
have
been
identified
by
the
questions
that
were
asked
and--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--illegal...
whether
the
jurors
had
any
feelings
about
illegal
alien
problems,
that
would
prevent
them
from
serving--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--your
honor...
for
sure,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--they
could
have
found
out
who
they
were
by
asking
the
questions
about
aliens.
since,
virtually
anybody
in
california,
or
in
southern
california,
especially
in
san
diego
county
which
borders
mexico...
170
miles
of
border
between
mexico...
and
as
this
court
pointed
out,
a
few
years
back,
the
government
had
estimated
that
85
percent
of
the
illegal
aliens
in
the
country
were
mexicans.
and
it
seems
to
me
highly
unlikely
that
anybody
living,
particularly
in
san
diego
county
could
conceivably
have
thought
that
this
question
about
illegal
aliens
doesn't
really
reach
my
bias
against
mexicans.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
right.
and
the
trial
took
place
in
san
diego.
mr.
george
w.
jones
or,
not
even
only
about
illegal
mexicans,
but
at
least
including
illegal
mexicans.
as
the
petitioner
again...
to
return
to
the
petitioner's
reliance
on
the
relationship
with
bowling's
daughter...
it
seems
that
the
trial
court's
questions
were
at
least,
at
least
as
effective
in
identifying
the
jurors,
prospective
jurors
who
might
have
found
the
relationship
objectionable
as
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
jurors
would
have--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--our
position
would
be
the
same
in
the
sense
that
the
legal
analysis
would
be
the
same.
we
might
say
that
in
a
particular
case
it
was
error
for
failure
to
ask
some
other
questions,
but
not
that
there's
some
different
legal
standard
to
be
applied.
mr.
george
w.
jones
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
further
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
at
the
close
of
the
last
session,
the
government
doesn't
believe
that
there
is
any
harm
in
asking
a
question
or
two
concerning
potential
racial
bias,
provided
that
the
questioning
is
not
interminable.
but
under
rule
24(a),
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
whether
a
particular
question
should
be
asked
in
light
of
all
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
and
if
so,
in
what
form,
is
left
to
the
trial
court's
discretion
subject
to
appellate
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
petitioner's
suggestion
that
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
ought
to
restructure
the
federal
voir
dire
system
is
flatly
contrary
to
rule
24(a).
similar
suggestions
were
made
and
implicitly
rejected
at
the
time
rule
24
was
initially
considered.
if
the
rule
is
to
be
amended
it
should
be
amended
by
the
rulemaking
or
rule
amending
procedures
set
up
for
that
purpose.
in
conclusion,
a
jury
verdict
based
on
virtually
overwhelming
evidence
should
not
be
reversed
solely
because
the
trial
court
failed
to
mention
the
obvious.
the
questions
asked
by
the
trial
court
were
sufficiently
specific
to
uncover
any
racial
bias
or
any
bias
against
petitioner
because
of
his
mexican
ancestry,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
proposed
question
could
have
been
any
more
effective
to
that
end.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
