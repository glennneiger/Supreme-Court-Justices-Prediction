justice
stewart
i
thought
so.
i
thought
your
primary
or
first
argument,
is
that
a
trial
judge
is
obligated
to
ask
this
question
of
a
prospective
juror
whenever
defense
counsel
requests
that
he
ask
the
question?
justice
stewart
regardless
of
what
may
be
a
court
as
a
sunday
morning
quarterback
would
see
as
a
possibility
of
racial
prejudice
in
a
particular
case,
either
by
the
reason
of
the
charge
in
the
case
or
the
race
of
the
defendant.
i
mean
possibly
the
defendant
might
be
a
caucasian.
and
the
offense
might
be
a
bank
robbery,
of
a
white
owned
and
operated
bank.
nonetheless,
if
you
have...
i
thought
your
initial
submission
was
that
if
defense
counsel
asks
that
this
question
be
asked
to
the
jury
that
it
must
be
asked?
justice
stewart
by
a
whole
negro
jury,
who
are
just
prejudiced
against
whiteys?
justice
stewart
you
would
have
lost
this
case
before
now
in
other
circuits?
justice
stewart
but
as
the
petitioner
points
out,
every
defendant
belongs
to
one
race
or
another,
and--
justice
stewart
--and
potentially
at
least,
there
can
be
racial
prejudice
against
any
race?
justice
stewart
and
his
claim
is,
as
you
know,
that
whenever
defense
counsel
asks
about...
asks
the
jury...
requests
that
the
jury
be
asked
about
racial
prejudice,
every
potential
juror...
that
it's
the
judge's
obligation
to
ask
these
questions.
justice
stewart
right.
every
case
it
says
may.
justice
stewart
and
there
was
no
denial
of
that?
justice
stewart
well
he's
arguing
for
either
alternative.
my
question
was
in
the
disjunctive
constitutional
or
per
se
rule.
per
se
rule,
under
supervisory
power.
that
isn't
what
you
were
conceding?
