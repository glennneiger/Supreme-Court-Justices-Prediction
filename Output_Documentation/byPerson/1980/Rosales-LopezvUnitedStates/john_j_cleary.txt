mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
may
have
been
some
doubt
about
the
standing
of
the
previous
case
before
the
court,
but
i
can
assure
you
that
the
case
now
before
you
is
certainly
worthy
of
your
consideration;
it
has
been
a
long
time
coming.
in
federal
criminal
cases,
voir
dire
is
seriously
sick
if
unfettered
judicial
discretion
may
preclude
any
inquiry
as
to
racial
prejudice.
before
this
court
is
both
a
constitutional
question,
we
would
contend,
under
the
amendment,
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
in
the
language
of
course,
of
ham
and
ristaino.
but
more
importantly
is
the
supervisory
power...
and
i'm
directing
your
attention,
of
course,
to
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
hughes
in
the
aldridge
case.
unfortunately,
in
federal
courts
there
has
been
caught
up
this
sense
of
expeditious
resolve
of
voir
dire.
it
has
become
sometimes
perfunctory,
some
have
called
it...
commentators,
even
those
working
for
the
federal
judicial
center,
calling
it
"routinized
ritual".
it
is
unfortunate,
because
it
has
strayed
a
long
way
from
its
original
beginning.
and
of
course,
some
of
that
must
be
laid
to
rest
at
the
feet
of
counsel.
the
old
days,
and
i
think
in
this
court's
opinion
in
swain,
there
was
reference
to
protracted
voir
dire
that
might
exist
in
the
state
court
system,
but
certainly
not
in
the
federal
courts.
my
district,
voir
dire
sometimes
is
10
or
15
minutes;
in
the
instant
case
it
was
6.
the
role
of
counsel,
even
in
submitting
written
questions,
is
squelched.
the
role
of
counsel
as
an
advocate,
even
implementing
the
sixth
amendment,
effective
assistance
of
counsel
is
a
mere
nullity.
and
what
counsel
has
seen,
and
i
must
admit,
as
a
trial
lawyer
that
there
has
been,
unfortunately,
didactic,
argumentative,
repetitive
voir
dire
by
attorneys
so
as
to
bring
in
the
judge
to
direct
and
control
the
inquiry
as
to
voir
dire.
we
feel
that
rule
24
clearly
permits
counsel,
as
an
advocate,
to
participate.
rule
24,
when
designed,
was...
permitted
the
defendant
to
inquire
as
to
peers,
as
to
any
serious
prejudice.
and
when
you
have
a
question
as
to
racial
prejudice
and
permit
not
one
question
on
that
issue,
what
is
the
impartial
jury?
where
did
our
american
system
go,
about
having
one
free
of
prejudice,
the
impartial
jury.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
first,
the
facts
of
this
case.
it's
a
little
case
but
it's
got
a
big
issue,
concerning
federal
criminal
practice...
little
case,
is
an
individual
by
the
name
of
humberto
rosales-lopez,
who's
charged
with
alien
smuggling,
one
of
about
six
or
seven,
unfortunately
he
exercised
his
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
had
that
right
accorded
to
him
and
was
sentenced
to
18
months
confinement
followed
by
a
30-year
suspended
sentence.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
disposition
of
the
other
defendants,
particularly
virginia
bowling,
who
copped
out
and
became
the
government
witness
against
him,
who
owned
and
operated
the
drop
house
in
southern
california,
she
was
given
a
misdemeanor
with
a
recommended
probation.
and
the
other
defendants
in
the
case
split
up,
the
worst
one
did
90
days
time,
of
all
people,
they
didn't
exercise
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
and
i'm
not
saying,
i'm
not
laying
any
blame
anywhere,
i'm
just
saying
that
those
who
didn't
go
to
trial,
no
matter
what
their
role
in
the
enterprise
was,
max'd
90
days.
a
person
who
goes
to
trial
by
jury,
18
months
followed
by
a
30
year
suspended
sentence.
if
there's
a
difference
to
be
drawn
there,
i
feel
there
is,
others
may
not,
but
that's
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
the
issue,
though,
is
when
a
person
asks
for
the
trial
by
jury,
what
type
of
justice
does
he
get?
and
i
think,
in
this
case,
it
was
a
mexican
who
was
charged
with
an
offense
involving
aliens.
the
critical
government
witness
was
a
virginia
bowling,
whose
19-year-old
daughter,
an
admitted
junkie
or
heroin
addict,
by
her
mother's
definition,
potentially
involved
in
the
same
transaction
involving
this
alien
smuggling
venture,
was
mentioned
throughout
in
the
trial.
now
the
petitioner,
defendant
in
lower
court,
was
her
lover,
quasi
husband,
whatever;
living
with
this
woman.
this
woman
was
clearly
caucasian,
and
counsel,
sensitive
to
this
issue,
wanted
the
question
asked
about
voir
dire.
what
was
important
in
this
case
was
the
effort
one
has
to
go
to
get
a
question
asked
about
racial
prejudice.
now
this
court
is
very
sensitive--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that
is
correct.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it's
even
worse;
it's
a
question
of
how
far
you'd
even
have
to
go
to
ask
questions--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that
is--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
procedure
under
rule
24.
and
as
the
court
knows,
it
is
done
in
over
75
percent
of
the
jurisdictions,
probably
more
at
the
present
time.
the
feeling
is
that
the
role
of
the
lawyer
is
completely
excluded
on
any
type
of
voir
dire,
and
i'm
not
here
to
suggest
that
you
introduce
them
without
limits,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
this
court
today,
in
this
case,
do
set
some
type
of
flexible
guidelines
to
deal
with
federal
criminal
practice.
and
i
can
only
emphasize
that
i'm
not
talking
about
state
criminal
practice.
this
case,
the
aggravation
exists
in
the
record
throughout.
first,
it
was
a
written
request
for
voir
dire
by
counsel,
and
counsel,
as
a
humble
supplicant,
said
i
don't
want
open
ended
voir
dire,
i
know
how
federal
judges
feel
about
voir
dire.
this
is
a
federal
case,
move
it
up,
move
it
out.
and
i
just
said,
can
i
have
15
to
30
minutes,
voir
dire,
just
to
kind
of
get
in
there
one
minute
per
juror...
denied.
written
request.
would
you
ask
the
question,
would
you
consider
the
race
or
mexican
descent
of
humberto
rosales-lopez
in
your
evaluation
of
the
case,
how
would
it
affect
you?
not
asked.
you'd
ask
the
judge,
before
voir
dire,
since
this
is
a
jury
trial
in
federal
court,
we
don't
want
to
give
them
the
feeling
that
it's
supermarket
justice,
could
you
give
a
preliminary
instruction
about
what
their
role
is,
what
the
jurors
are
going
to
do
in
their
case?
denied.
at
side
bar,
after
the
judge
asks,
have
you
got
any
further
questions,
you
step
up
to
the
side
bar
and
the
request
is
made.
the
trouble
is,
well
i
think
the
court
missed
some;
i
asked
for
six
questions
and
the
question
i
said,
in
this
case,
i
feel
that
inquiry
should
be
made
as
to
racial
prejudice.
i
think
the
court
is
compelled,
this
is
my
language,
under
aldridge,
a
decision
of
this
court
by
chief
justice
hughes,
to
ask
the
question.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
race
have
to
do
with
this
trial?
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
in
this
case,
i
think
we
have
the
defendant,
who
is
mexican,
i
think
by
his
appearance
it
would
be
obvious.
and
that
further,
that
the
jurors
in
this
case,
would
have
before
them,
someone
that
they
could
have
a
bias.
and
that--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
none
of
the
jurors
were
mexican
or
mexican-american.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
positive.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well
because
i
included
in
my
brief,
their
surnames
of...
well,
they
might
have
had
a...
on
the
non
named
side,
that
is,--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--right.
they
might
have
been
mexican.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i
can
only
state
first,
that
when
any
defendant
might
be
the
object
of
racial
prejudice...
the
defendant
himself,
in
a
federal
criminal
case...
the
issue
may
be
asked.
in
a
federal
bank
robbery
case,...
i
was
representing
a
caucasian
defendant
charged
with
bank
robbery,
and
i
asked
the
judge
would
you
ask
as
to
any
racial
prejudice
or
antagonism,
it's
my
client.
the
judge
looked
down
over
his
glasses--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--your
honor--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
mexican.
the
jurors,
who
was
his
triers
of
fact,
the
ultimate
arbiters
of
the
facts,
could
have
had
a
bias,
they
could
have
been
bigoted
against
him
in
this
particular
case.
under
this
court's
analysis
in
aldridge,
there
was
a
black
defendant
charged
with
the
murder
of
a
white
policeman.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
okay.
his
relationship
was
unfortunately
with
the
woman,
a
caucasian,
who
was
using
her
white-anglo
status
to
transport
the
latin-appearing
individuals
in
the
trunk
of
her
vehicle.
as
the
record
indicates,
she
used
that
appearance,
or
she
could
escape
detection
by
going
through
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
that
status
and
that
person
was
a
critical
witness
in
this
case.
her
credibility
was
an
issue.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i,
in
fact,
at
this
time,
i
didn't
know
whether
or
not--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
only
said
that...
i
just--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
felt
that
the
court,
under
federal
law,
should
permit
a
question
as
to
racial
prejudice
when
it's
raised
by
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
cited
all--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well
your
honor,
the
court
notes...
the
court
didn't
even
permit
me,
the
trial
court,
to
even
finish
the
six
questions
that
i
had
asked
for
and
that...
my
limited
role,
it
is
very
difficult.
second
of
all,
it's
difficult
for
counsel
to
project
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
to
the
trial
judge
who
might
not
be
familiar
with
it.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
concerns
here,
it's
a
very
serious
concern,
is
there
are
trial
court
judges
might
not
be
privvy
to
all
the
facts,
terms
or
directions
in
which
a
case
might
go.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
there
are
some
times
even
trial
lawyers
know
that
you
can't
anticipate
every
move
at
trial.
in
this
case--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
i
could
probably--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
i
don't
think
it
was
it
was
pertinent
here
because
the
reason
it
wasn't,
was
that
the
daughter,
kim...
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
going
to
call
her
to
testify.
and
as
the
record
reflects
in
this
case,
i
had
subpoenaed
kim,
the
daughter,
and
that
relationship
of
the
daughter
vis
a
vis
my
client,
would
be
an
issue.
further,
i
think
that
it
was
pertinent
in
this
case
that
she
didn't
ultimately
testify
because
the
government
then
subpoenaed
her,
and
it
was
a
question
of
who
was
going
to
use
who
for
what
purpose.
i
think,
further,
that
when
you
have
a
mexican
defendant
charged
in
an
alien
smuggling
case,
in
a
community
in
the
proximity
of
the
border,
that
those
facts
alone
justify
under
aldridge,
an
inquiry.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
my
feeling
that
the
courts
decisions
in,
i
believe
it's
the
texas
case,
the
most
recent
one
is
castaneda
v.
partida,
where
the
court
held
that
mexican-americans
were
a
minority
type
of
group.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well
the
question
is
as
to--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well
if
i--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well
i
think
that
even
if
a
person
were,
say,
a
mexican-american--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--status
as
a
mexican
is
not.
and
for
example,
i
could
be
a
mexican
citizen.
and
whether
or
not
a
jury
is
prejudiced
against
me
because
of
my
mexican
status,
is
irrelevant,
because
whether
the
person
is
a
citizen...
could
it
be
a
mexican-american,
sitting
in
the
courtroom--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
there
was
inquiry
as
to
alienage
and
to
an
alien
problem.
but
i
think
that
that
doesn't
direct
itself
specifically
to
the
point
we're
concerned
with
in
this
case,
which
is
this
antagonism.
to
me,
racism
is
an
irrational
belief
in
the
superiority
of
one's
own
racial
or
ethnic
classification
so
that,
many
times
it
will
determine
or
turn
on
who
the
particular
object...
for
example,
a
member
of
a
minority
group
could
be
prejudiced
against
a
minority
group
under
this
definition,
and
shouldn't
you
be
allowed
to
probe
that
in
a
federal
criminal
case.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
we
had
some
glancing
questions
as
to
alienage,
think
of
what
could
happen
in
the
penumbra
of
such
an
inquiry?
first,
that
could
be
directed
towards
the
offense
itself.
we
have
the
response
of
one
juror,
when
asked
about
aliens,
what
did
that
bring
up
to
her
mind
when
asked
about
aliens.
well
there's...
that's
the
name
they
used
about
persons
who
transport
prisoners...
i
mean,
persons
who
transport
the
aliens.
that
concept
right
there,
itself,
tells
us
a
little
bit
about
what
that
meant.
to
that
person
it
meant
something
to
do
with
people
who
move
human
flesh,
which
is
an
odious
concern.
that
was
not
the
nature
of
my
inquiry.
the
nature
of
my
inquiry
was
as
to
his
racial
descent,
or
racial
background,
or
descent.
and
in
my
voir
dire
question
to
avoid
the
problem
raised
by
both
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
asked
as
to
mexican
race
or
descent
because
of
the
possible
ambiguity
in
this
area.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
that
is--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--my
experience,
it
has
been
yes.
and
in
the
case
of--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well
your
honor,
the
one
difficulty
with
that
area
is
that
there
is...
if
you
put
it
as
a
rhetorical,
you
know,
would
you
be
raising
prejudice
against
the
defendant
sitting
here?
the
answer
of
course,
no
one
would
say
no.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
social
science
studies
that
i
presented
with
my
brief,
that
you
sometimes
have
to
approach
it
very
indirectly.
in
this
case,
i
tried
to
phrase
it,
would
you
consider
it
in
the
evaluation
of
your
case?
and
i
think
that
when
jurors
are
sworn,
and
what
is
voir
dire,
to
speak
the
truth;
that
if,
someone
asks
me,
i
might
have
to
think
a
bit
about
the
question,
and
then
would
respond.
the
question
might
come
as
to
school
integration,
which
might
trigger
a
racial
basis
and
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is,
what
type
of
probing
is
necessary.
and
to
me,
to
think
that
the
courts
would
permit
no
question
to
be
asked
because
the
fear
is
that
the
person
wouldn't
be
truthful,
would
undermine
our
whole
judicial
system.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
don't
think
so,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
in
this
case
if
you
look
at...
what
the
question
was
asked
to
measure
the
response,
it
could
have
been
aliens
or
the
alien
problems,
it
could
have
been
the
feeling
about
the
immigration
laws,
how
a
person
feels
about
it.
it
could
be
a
feeling
about
the
poor,
about
the
poor
looking
for
a
better
way
of
life
when
she
says,
my
feelings
which
are
undefined
by
the
very
nature
of
the
question.
third,
i
think
that
there's
a
question
as
to
how
do
you
feel
about
this
individual
sitting
in
this
courtroom,
specificity.
because
rather
than
dealing
with
an
abstraction
there
should
have
been
some
concrete
direction
or
alerting
of
the
jurors
as
to
this
possible
bias.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes,
he
did,
he
did
have
to
stand.
and
i
think
that
would
only
trigger
the
fact
that
his
presence
as
being
a
latin,
or
one
of
the...
could
have
been
subject
of
racial
bigotry,
was
even
just
presented
in
that
fashion
and
i
think
further,
what's
really
critical
about
this
case,
is
that
the
perfunctory
nature
of
the
question
and
further,
after
the
voir
dire,
where
counsel
specifically
requests
that
the
inquiry...
that
it
had
to
be
made.
i
think
also
to--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
that,
under
the
ninth
circuit
law,
he
could
have
followed
it.
however,
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
aldridge
and
the
language
in
ristaino
v.
ross
clearly
set
a
different
standard
that
would...
have,
by
my
interpretation
of
it,
set
aside
the
ninth
circuit
precedent.
and
i
think
that
the
question
that
your
honor
raises
as
to
alienage
as
distinguished
from
race
or
nationality,
this
court
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
espinoza
v.
farah
manufacturing,
held
that
an
employer
who
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
alienage,
that
is
to
say,
mexicans,
was
not
treading
on
the
ground
that
i
was
trying
to
touch
upon,
that
is,
to
say
as
to
race
or
nationality,
that
there
was
a
clear
cut
delineation
in
that
area
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
assert
here.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
it
was,
but
it
was
dealing
with
the
terms
we're
dealing
with
here,
and
the
bias
of
prejudice.
the
congress
gave
protection
as
to
bias
as
to
race
or
nationality.
it
did
not
give
protection
as
to
alienage,
and
as
to...
what
i
was
trying
to
probe
at
was
the
protected
area,
that
is
to
say,
discrimination
against
race
or
ethnic
or
nationality
classification.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
my
concern
is
not
as
to
the
offense,
at
all.
my
concern
is
do
any
of
these
prospective
jurors
have
any
type
of
bias
against
my
client
because
of
his
mexican
race
or
descent?
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
the
history
and
tradition
of
california
is
overwhelming
in
that
respect,
starting
back
from
the
california
days
to
studies
now
in
california
history
teachers...
they
get
a
period
of...
of
rebuke...
of
the
mexicans
within
the
culture,
originally
california
was
a
part
of
mexico.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
it
could
have
been
any
offense,
but
i
think
that
it
brings
out
the
racial
characteristic,
because
you're
going
to
have
other
individuals
involved
in
it,
and
again,
the
fact,
the
exploitation
of
people
who
themselves
might
be
mexicans,
might
be
another
aggravating
factor
that
would
be
considered.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
relief
sought
here
is
no
more
than
a
simple
standard
that
aldridge
be
complied
with,
that
there
the
thought
that...
and
again,
the
language
of
chief
justice
hughes
that
someone
who
might
have
a
bias
beyond
the
jury,
the
trier
of
fact,
cannot
allow
this
court
to
stand.
further,
in
peters
v.
kiff,
you
have
a
long
line
of
the
cases
where
a
white
defendant
was
allowed
to
assert
the
fact
that
members
of
the...
blacks
were
not
included
in
a
prospective
panel.
the
court
held
that--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
right.
that
was
my--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that
is
my
submission.
your
honor,
and
the
point
i--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no.
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
justice
stewart,
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
my
position,
basically,
is
that
race
can
go
any
direction,
not
just
against
minorities--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--precisely.
and
the
answer
is--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--there--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well
i
think
that
a
person--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--your
honor,
i
think
that
when
you
deal
with
racial
prejudice,
we're
dealing
with
such
a
touchy
and
very
sensitive
area,
that
if
counsel
who
hopefully
are
not
incompetent,
seriously
want
the
inquiry
made,
for
the
court
to
deny
it,
i
think,
would
be
improper.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that's
not
before
the
court.
the
religious
issue
might
be...
either
way,
is
how
the
court
would
construe
connors,
it
didn't
allow
political
inquiry.
religion
may,
in
the
terms
of
the
particular
case,
be
appropriate,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
basically,
is
the
race.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--there
is
no--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
in
fact,
i
think
what
is
the
purpose
is,
one,
it
shouldn't
be
sua
sponte.
two,
it
must
be
upon
the
request
of
counsel--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
think
it
has
to
be
in
the
context
of
the
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no,
i'm
saying
only
as
to
the
defendant,
but
as
to
any
particular
case.
meaning,
i'm
not
saying,
if
he
comes
in
and
asks
prejudice
about
blacks,
whatever,
i
think
that
as
to
anything,
any
hostility
of
the
prospective
jurors
towards
the
racial
or
ethnic
classification
of
any
particular
defendant,
any
particular
defendant,
not
just
mexican
defendants.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no.
no,
i
think
you
have
to
ask...
i
could
not
ask
if...
in
my
case,
are
you
prejudiced
against
blacks,
because
my
client
was
mexican.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
my
question
was,
precisely
only
antagonisms
as
towards
mexicans.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
witness
would
not
be
on
trial.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
a
possible
thing,
but
we're
dealing
with
the
unfettered--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
think
in
that
particular
case
you'd
have
to
give
both,
the--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--the
antagonism
towards...
three,
mexican,
black
or
a
group
of
a
group
of--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--the
answer,
i
think,
in
that
case
is
that
i
think
a
person
who
might
have
those
exhibits
might
trigger
off
some
hostility,
which
it
could
be...
sensitively
inquiry--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well,
i
think
that
counsel
has
to
make
an
informed
judgment;
if
he
thought
the
individual
might
be
acceptable
and
the--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
i--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--in
the
inquiry
as
to
racial
prejudice
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
excuse
me.
the
question
as
to
student
status
might
not
be
pertinent,
but
to
being
iranian,
i
think
that
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
race
is
a
difficult
term
to
define,
but
it
usually
includes
not
only
physical
characteristics,
but
certain
ethnic
delineations
that
have
certain
physical
characteristics
with
it.
and
so,
it
has
the
physical
characteristics...
in
my
case,
brown
skin,
a
certain
appearance,
dark
hair...
that
then,
the
inquiry
must
be
made.
but
i
think
maybe
between
certain
european
stock,
as
to
whether
such...
that
might
depend
upon
the
circumstances.
i
think--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--because
i
think,
and
again,
i'm
not
trying
to
get
into
anthropology,
i
think
the
classifications
would
not
define
all
of
those...
i
don't
think
you
could
call...
say,
germans,
and
french
different
races.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well
i
think--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--mr.
justice
stevens,
you
are
correct.
however,
given
the
context
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
reach
that
position.
but
as
a
minimum
fall
back
position,
i'll
stick
with
race.
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct.
i
think--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--well,
no,
i'm
trying
to
say
that
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
area
of
racial
prejudice,
that
i
have
asked
for
in
this
case.
i
think
that
voir
dire
has
to
probe
for
any
serious
prejudice;
in
this
case,
it
didn't
probe
for
any
serious
prejudice
at
all,
and
are
not
before
the
court
on
any
issue
other
than
as
to
racial
prejudice.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
dissent
of
the
majority
in
ham
v.
south
carolina,
my
feeling
is
as
to
the
beards,
if
it
would
be
a
serious
prejudice
in
the
case.
and
my
position
would
be
that,
on
voir
dire,
that
should
clearly
be
explored,
if
counsel
would
give
some
feeling
that
these
individuals
might
represent
some
threat
to
the
jurors
that
should
be
explored
by
the
judge.
however,
the
position
i'm
saying
is
that
what
constitutes
a
serious
prejudice
has
to
be
defined
by
cases.
in
that
case,
we're
reviewing
a
state
criminal
proceedings,
you
have
before
you
a
federal
criminal
proceeding
and
to
me,
minimum
due
process
fairness
requires
exploration
as
to
any
serious
prejudice
or--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
right.
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
relationship
of
the
defendant
to
the--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--because
the
feeling
on
that
one
as
to
the
issue
was
that
they
didn't
really
think
the
question
had
to
be
asked
in
the
first
instance.
if
this
court
held
that
the
question
had
to
be
asked,
then
we
won't
reach
harmless
error.
in
this
particular
case
where
the
racial
polarization,
the
white,
caucasian,
and
the
defendant
going
with
a
19-year-old
daughter
who
may
be
in
the
alien
smuggling
venture,
who
may
be
a
junkie,
who
the
jury...
could
figure
that
this
defendant
corrupted
this
young
flower,
this
woman
who
is
a
witness
for
the
government,
in
the
case
where
the
issue
turns
solely
on
credibility.
there's
no
overwhelming--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
in
the
brief,
i
think
i
presented
almost
all
the
points.
i
don't...
i
can't
give
you
exactly
the
wording--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
--i
felt,
my
feeling
was
even
under
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
case,
should
have
been
heard...
there
should
have
been
inquiry
as
to--
