justice
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
marshall
half
of
the
jurors
were
mexican,
weren't
they?
justice
marshall
are
you
sure?
justice
marshall
how
are
you
sure?
justice
marshall
i
know
a
mexican
named
mccarthy.
justice
marshall
oh
sure.
justice
marshall
sure.
why
do
you
have
to
have
race
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
what's
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
marshall
what's
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
marshall
there
you
see
race
right
there.
one
race
murdered
another
race.
but
this
mexican,
who
did
he...
what
did
he
do
to
anybody
else?
justice
marshall
did
you
argue
that
to
the
judge?
justice
marshall
did
you
argue
that
to
the
judge?
justice
marshall
what
did
you
tell
the
judge
was
the
reason
that
you
wanted
this
charge?
justice
marshall
pro
se,
pro
se?
justice
marshall
but
you
have
nothing
beyond
that?
justice
marshall
and
it's
your
duty
to
see
that
he
is
acquainted
with
the
facts,
that's
a
part
of
your
job.
justice
marshall
and
here
you
didn't.
you
didn't
give
him
all
the
facts.
justice
marshall
one
of
these
days
i'm
going
to
write
an
encyclopedia
of
116
foot
shelf
of
things
that
lawyers
could
have
done
that
they
thought
of
on
their
way
home,
after
the
hearing.
you'll
help
me
on
that,
won't
you?
justice
marshall
that
doesn't
help
me
here,
though,
does
it?
justice
marshall
mr.
cleary,
would
your
rule
apply
to
a
mexican-american
charged
with
murdering
a
mexican-american?
justice
marshall
and
the
all
negro
jury
opposed
against
negroes?
justice
marshall
you
could
have
that.
justice
marshall
is
there
any
way...
is
there
any
end
to
this?
no,
no.
no
end
at
all.
justice
marshall
mr.
cleary,
suppose
the
defendant
is
a
blond,
blue
eyed
mexican
or
negro.
would
you
have
to
give
it
then?
justice
marshall
you'd
have
to--
justice
marshall
--bear
in
mind
now,
i'm
going
to...
well,
i
wanted
to
warn
you
that
i
was
going
to
ask
you
why.
justice
marshall
trigger
hostility,
they
wouldn't
even
know
he
was
a
negro.
justice
marshall
so
counsel
is
going
to
run
the
government?
justice
marshall
whenever
counsel
makes
up
his
mind
that...
this
is
your
position,
is
it
not...
that
whenever
counsel
makes
up
his
mind,
that
that
charge
is
necessary,
the
judge
must
give
it.
isn't
that
where
you
end
up?
justice
marshall
you're
really
moving
out,
now.
what
about
the
germans?
justice
marshall
what
about
germans
and
italians?
justice
marshall
well
excuse
me,
finish
with
the
chief
justice.
justice
marshall
well
mr.
jones,
you
may
understand
what
i'm
talking
about,
whether
it's
a
constitutional
rule
or
a
supervisory
rule,
it
would
end
up
in
being
a
per
se
rule?
is
that
what
they're
arguing
for?
justice
marshall
so
there
is
no
difference;
they
just
want
a
per
se
rule
either
way?
that's
right.
that's
the
way
i...
am
i
right,
mr.
jones?
