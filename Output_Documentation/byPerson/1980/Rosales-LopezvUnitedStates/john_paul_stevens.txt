justice
stevens
provided
the
defendant
is
a
mexican?
no,
no.
justice
stevens
mr.
cleary,
before
you
sit
down,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand...
i
may
not
have
caught
the
full
thrust
of
your
argument.
suppose
this
trial
was
in
alaska
or
maine,
and
there
aren't
any...
haven't
been
any
mexicans
in
the
state
for
100
years,
and
the
crime
has
nothing
to
do
with
mexicans,
you
mean
to
say
the
trial
judge
had
the
duty
to
ask
a
question
about
prejudice
against
mexicans?
if
requested
by
the
defendant?
justice
stevens
suppose
he
has
to
ask
a)
mexicans,
b)
negroes,
c)
catholics,
d)
what...
made
a
list
of
100.
would
he
have
to
ask
them
all?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
but
i'm
having
counsel
ask,
he
doesn't
know,
maybe
the...
man
has
a
great
uncle
who
was
french,
he
wants
to
know
is
there
any
prejudice
for
or
against
french?
justice
stevens
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
defendants.
but
that's
different
now.
justice
stevens
well
i
understand,
but
need
not...
you're
not
even
arguing
that
the
defendant
in
the
case
in
which
the
request
is
made
has
to
be
of
the
racial
or
national
origin
to
which
the
question
pertains?
justice
stevens
exactly.
justice
stevens
well
all
right.
but
then,
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
i
guess.
well
but
what
about
witnesses?
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
white
client
but
plan
to
call
a
mexican
witness
and
a
black
witness,
or...
and
an
armenian
witness
and
a
swedish
witness
and
a
finnish
witness,
presumably
you
virtually
need
a
textbook
on
anthropology
in
order
to
conduct
voir
dire.
justice
stevens
i
have
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
now,
this
is...
how,
this
follows
up
with
what
justice
brennan
asked
you,
how
significant
is...
in
your
argument,
is
the
factor
of
race?
supposing
you
had
a
student
who
was
shown
to
be
an
iranian,
and...
an
iranian
citizen,
would
you,
under
your
argument,
be
entitled
to
ask
the
jury
if...
could
they
give
a
fair
trial
to
an
iranian
student?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
racial
aspect
is
not
critical
rather,
it's
some
characteristic
of
the
defendant
that
you
think
might
give
rise
to
some
prejudicial
reaction?
justice
stevens
why
would
that
be
different?
i
mean,
if
you
have
neighborhoods
in
big
cities
where
there
are
prejudices...
the
german
neighborhood
right
across
the
street
from
a
neighborhood
of...
say,
a
polish
neighborhood,
why
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
right
there?
justice
stevens
well
but
what
difference
does
it
make
whether...
why
is
race
significant
to
your
argument
at
all?
i
think
the...
i
thought
the
touchstone
would
be
potential
prejudice?
justice
stevens
if
you've
got
a
group
of
people
who
may
be
the
object
of
prejudice
within
a
community,
why
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
they
are
black
or
iranian,
i
just
don't
understand?
justice
stevens
see,
you're
suggesting
an
irrational
distinction.
race
and
other
kinds
of
prejudice.
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
interrupt
for
a
preliminary
question?
in
the
procedure
that
was
followed
by
the
trial
judge
here,
was
the
government
given
an
opportunity
to
object
to
the
questions
proposed
by
defense
counsel
to
be
asked
by
the
court?
and
if
so,
did
the
government
object
to
this
particular
question?
justice
stevens
so
you
wouldn't
know...
the
government
doesn't
take
the
position
that
there
would
have
been
anything
wrong
with
the
judge
asking
the
question,
it's
just
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
do
so?
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
supposing
this
had
been
a
black
defendant
and
the
request
had
been
framed
in
terms
of
racial
prejudice
specifically.
would
you
say
that...
and
the
crime
had
actually
nothing
to
do
with
a
black/white
problem...
would
you
say
that
the
judge
would
have
had
a
duty
to
ask
the
questions?
justice
stevens
well
it
would
have
in
some
other
circuits,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
supposing
you
had
an
ordinary
burglary
trial,
had
no
racial
overtones,
and
about
a
week
after
the
pearl
harbor
bombing,
and
the
defendant
was
a
japanese.
would
he
have
had
a
right
to
have
this
kind
of
question
asked
about
potential
prejudice
against
japanese?
justice
stevens
well
why?
justice
stevens
fact
that
he's
japanese.
justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
nobody's
arguing
the
constitutional
rule.
justice
stevens
nobody's
arguing
the
constitutional
rule.
it's
a
question
of
supervisory
power.
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
you're
not...
when
you
conduct
voir
dire,
you're
not
assuming
that
everybody
has...
you're
trying
to
find
that
one
rare
person
who
may
have
the
prejudice
and
you
want
to
get
him
off
the
jury.
and
you...
i
doubt
if
you
would
suggest
that
it's
totally
fantastic
to
assume
that
without
regard
to
what
the
facts
of
the
case
might
have
been,
there
probably
are
some
people
in
san
diego
or
los
angeles
who
are
prejudiced
against
mexicans
and--
justice
stevens
--what's
wrong
with
trying
to
find
out
who
they
are?
justice
stevens
there's
no
question
about
mexicans
were
asked.
questions
about
illegal
smuggling
and
all
that,
i
suppose
everybody's
against
illegal
smuggling.
justice
stevens
but
some
of
these
people,
i'm
hypothesizing,
may
actually
be
out
there,
are
people
who
are
not
concerned
about
illegal
aliens
but
they
just
don't
like
mexicans,
period;
legal,
illegal,
citizen,
whatever
they
are.
there
are
such
people,
you
know,
who
are
prejudiced.
justice
stevens
and
what's
wrong
with
trying
to
find
out
who
they
are
before
you
let
them
sit
on
the
jury?
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
just
to
emphasize
one
point,
the
government's
position
would
be
precisely
the
same
as
far
as
the
bottom
line
is
concerned
if
none
of
these
other
questions
had
been
asked
about
illegal
smuggling,
as
i
understand
you?
you
just
don't
have
to
ask
a
question
that
is
merely
related
to
the
race
or
national
origin
of
the
person
even
though
the
community
might
harbor
prejudice
against
that
particular
race
or
minority.
that's
your
bottom
line,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
jones?
