justice
rehnquist
mr.
cleary,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
appendix
at
page
18.
you've
referred
to
a
couple
of
questions,
that
whereas
by
the
district
court,
as
glancing,
and
i
take
it,
one
of
them
is
the
court's
question
towards
the
top
of
that
page,...
let
me
again
ask
the
general
question,
do
any
of
you
have
any
particular
feelings
one
way
or
the
other
about
aliens
or
could
you
sit
as
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
if
you
are
called
upon
to
do
so,
in
the
back
row.
and
then
juror
skelly
responds,
christine
skelly,
and
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
it.
i
don't
think
i
could
be
impartial.
i
have
a
tendency
to
feel
my
own
feelings,
i
don't
think
i
could
be
a
fair
juror.
and
then
the
judge
goes
ahead
and
excuses
her.
don't
you
think
the
judge
did
enough
here
to
alert
the
jurors
to
the
type
of
case
and
to
the
problems
that
they
might
face
along
the
line
that
you've
outlined?
justice
rehnquist
that
was
a
statutory
case,
was
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
witness
may
not
be
on
trial,
but
the
fact
that
the
jury
were
prejudiced
against
the
testimony
of
the
witness
might
seriously
impair
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
justice
rehnquist
how
about
people
with
beards?
supposing
a
defendant
had
a
beard,
and
it's
a
middle
class,
all
white,
jury,
with
clean
shaven
faces?
justice
rehnquist
well
isn't
it
true,
counsel,
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
involving
illegal
smuggling
of
aliens,
people
of
entirely
caucasian
background
might
have
quite
different
feelings;
some
might
be
very
sympathetic
to
someone
who
is
smuggling
illegal
aliens
because
they
could
use
them
for
labor
on...
in
agri
business,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
whereas
others
might
feel
that,
you
know,
we
just
don't
want
any
people
like
that
in
this
state.
i
mean
the
prejudice
can
extend
in
any
direction.
justice
rehnquist

in
imperial
beach,
