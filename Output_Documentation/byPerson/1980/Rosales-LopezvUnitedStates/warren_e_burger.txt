we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
lopez
against
the
united
states.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
cleary.
chief
justice
burger
you
lost
me
there
a
minute,
mr.
cleary.
you
say,
unfortunately
he
elected
to
trial
by
jury?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
cleary,
i
suppose
it's
an
unspoken
premise
of
your
entire
argument
that
when
you
put
a
question
about
ethnic
or
other
prejudice
that
the
person
to
whom
the
question
is
addressed
will
immediately
answer
in
good
faith
and
fully
and
honestly?
chief
justice
burger
do
many
people
in
the
ordinary
course
of
human
experiences
admit
prejudices
when
they
have
them?
chief
justice
burger
yours
is
contrary
to
the
human
experience
reported
in
all
the
authorities
who
have
undertaken
to
write
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
burger
well
then,
mr.
jones,
you
are
saying
no
more,
i
take
it,
than
that
it
might
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
decline
to
ask
the
question
justice
stevens
suggested
to
you,
not
a
constitutional
per
se
rule?
chief
justice
burger
you
weren't
suggesting
that
there
should
be
a
constitutional
rule
on
this?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
think
that
would
be
equally
applicable
as
to
the
need,
now,
the
need
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view,
if
the
defendant
has
a
substantial
criminal
record
but
may
want
to
take
the
stand?
would
such
a
rule
that
we're
talking
about
that's
being
advocated,
indicate
that
the
question
would
be
required,
would
you
as
a
juror
be
biased
against
a
person
if
it
developed
that
he
had
four
criminal
convictions?
chief
justice
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that
no
juror...
intellectually
qualified
to
sit
on
the
jury
would
have
thought
they
were
talking
about
finlanders
or
swedes
or
south
africans,
but
only
about
illegal
mexicans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
reflect
further
on
that
during
the
noon
hour
and
we
will
resume
at
one
o'clock.
mr.
jones,
we've
used
about
five
minutes
of
your
time
but
we
won't
charge
it
to
you;
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
white
has
two
--
the
disposition
of
two
cases
to
announce.
