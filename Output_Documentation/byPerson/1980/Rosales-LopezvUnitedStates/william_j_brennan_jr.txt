justice
jr.
do
i
gather
the
practice
in
that
court
is
the
judge
often
asks
all
the
questions
of
the
panel?
justice
jr.
no,
but
i
mean...
counsel
have
to
submit
questions
to
the
judge,
and
he
either
agrees
or--
justice
jr.
--refuses
to
ask
them?
justice
jr.
why?
what
does
race
have
to
do
with
this
trial?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
cleary,
have
we
ever
addressed
the
question
whether
discrimination
against
a
mexican
is
racial
discrimination?
justice
jr.
well
minority,
all
right,
but
is
the
discrimination
racial,
that's
what
i
mean,
technically
racial?
justice
jr.
of
course,
with
orientals,
you
have
a
different
color
than
caucasian,
so
are
blacks.
but
are
mexicans?
justice
jr.
a
different
race?
justice
jr.
i
don't
suggest
there
may
not...
nevertheless,
be
the
kind
of
discrimination
you
are
arguing
for,
but
is
it
a
racial
discrimination?
justice
jr.
well
there
might
be
discrimination
against
the
discreet
minority
of
mexicans...
my
brother
marshall
has
been
suggesting...
is
that
necessarily
a
racial
discrimination?
and
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
cleary,
was
the
basis
of
your
concern
that
there
exists
in
your
community
a
bias
against
mexicans,
or
is
it
a
bias
against
mexicans
engaged
in
bringing
in
illegal
aliens?
justice
jr.
well
that's
what...
is
there
any...
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
community
generally
there
is
a
bias
against
mexicans,
that
they
are
looked
down
upon
as
a
minority,
or
something?
justice
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
offense
was
importing
the
illegal
aliens,
it
could
have
been
any
offense?
justice
jr.
well
what
do
you
suggest,
mr.
jones,
should
be
the
standard
by
which,
if
it's
not
a
per
se
rule,
the
trial
judge
should
decide
whether
they
will
or
won't
ask
the
question
that
the
defense
counsel
requests?
justice
jr.
well
counsel
here
had
suggested
to
the
judge,
one
of
the
reasons
i'd
like
that
question
asked
in
this
case
is
that
it's
likely
to
come
out
during
the
trial
a
relationship
between
this
young
lady
and
the
defendant
in
that
circumstance,
had
he
done
so
and
the
judge
still
refused
to
ask
the
question,
would
you
have
thought
that
was
the
question?
