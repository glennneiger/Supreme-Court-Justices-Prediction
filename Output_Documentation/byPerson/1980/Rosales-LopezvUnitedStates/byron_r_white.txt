justice
white
well
what
about
religion?
justice
white
well,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
your...
what
i'll
call
a
per
se
approach,
that
any
time
counsel
asks
the
question
must
be...
do
you
lose
this
case,
then?
justice
white
you
think
there
are
special
circumstances
that...
in
any
event,
in
this
case
the
question
should
have
been
asked?
justice
white
but
you've
lost
on
that
in
every
other
court?
justice
white
but
you
argued
to
the...
this
is
from
the
ninth
circuit,
is
it?
justice
white
did
you
argue
this...
that
even
if
there
isn't
a
general
rule
about
it,
at
least
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
question
should
have
been
asked?
justice
white
well,
you
presented
it
and
it
was
rejected
that's
a
sort
of
a
factual
inquiry.
justice
white
are
we
to
assume
that
you...
that
the
united
states
thinks
the,
if
the
question
about
aliens
hadn't
been
asked
there
would
have
been
error
here?
justice
white
i
know.
but
what
if
he
hadn't
asked
about
aliens?
justice
white
was
there
enough...
was
this
the
kind
of
a
case
where
some
kind
of
a
question
about
alienage
or
mexican
americans
should
have
been
asked?
justice
white
that's
what
i...
so
it's
not,
you
would
even
get
to
the
discretion
problem?
justice
white
so
you
would
be
losing
this
case
in
other
circuits?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
seems
to
be
the
ninth
circuit's
day,
both
the
cases
i
have
are
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
rosales-lopez
against
united
states,
the
petitioner
is
of
mexican
descent.
he
was
tried
and
convicted
by
a
jury
of
participating
in
an
illegal
plan
to
bring
mexican
aliens
into
the
country.
in
the
course
of
selecting
the
jury
he
requested
the
trial
judge
to
make
specific
inquiry
of
the
prospective
jurors
as
to
the
possibility
of
racial
or
ethnic
prejudice.
a
request
was
refused
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
no
further
inquiry
was
needed.
we
granted
certiorari
because
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
lower
federal
courts
differ
widely
as
to
when
and
under
what
circumstances
specific
inquiry
as
to
this
kind
of
prejudice
need
be
made.
we
affirmed
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
to
this
effect
in
which
justices
stewart,
blackmun,
and
powell,
joined.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
reaches
the
same
result
by
a
different
course,
he
has
filed
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joins.
mr.
justice
stevens
dissents
and
has
filed
an
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
joined.
