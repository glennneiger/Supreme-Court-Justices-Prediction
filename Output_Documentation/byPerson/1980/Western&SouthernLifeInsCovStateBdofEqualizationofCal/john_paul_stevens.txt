justice

mr.
vogeler,
in
the
hobbs
jurisdictional
statement,
was
there
an
equal
protection
issue
raised?
justice
stevens
and
you
said
earlier
in
response
to
justice
white
that
there
was
an
equal
protection
issue
in
benjamin.
what
equal
protection
issue
was
raised
in
benjamin?
justice
stevens
no,
but
there
was
a
tax
which
for
purposes
of
decision
was
assumed
to
discriminate
against
interstate
companies
as
opposed
to
south
carolina
companies,
because
it
was
levied
only
on
the
premiums
paid
or
collected
by
the
out-of-state
companies.
justice
stevens
but
that
was
done
in
an
interstate
commerce
context.
justice
stevens
was
it
argued
in
that
case
that
that
violated
the
equal
protection
clause?
i
thought
you
suggested
to
mr.
justice
white
that
it
was
so
argued,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
was.
well,
whether
it
was
or
not,
didn't
mr.
justice
rutledge
say
it
didn't
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
either?
did
he
say
that
or
did
he
say
the
mccarran
act
didn't
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
stevens
and--
justice
stevens
but
general
laddish,
is
it
not
true
that
the
discrimination
in
ohio
is
between
domestic
companies
and
all
foreign
insurance
companies?
justice
stevens
whereas
in
california
the
discrimination
is,
say,
between
an
oklahoma
insurance
company
and
an
ohio
insurance
company
and
a
georgia
insurance
company;
might
pay
three
different
tax
rates?
justice
stevens
quite
a
different
problem.
justice
stevens
that
is,
the
former
claim
that
we
had
in
the
benjamin
case.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
but
the
issue
we
have,
as
i
understand
the
equal
protection
issue
we
have,
is
whether
california
may
treat
a
group
of
insurance
companies
from
different
states
differently
because
they're
from
different
states,
not
a
distinction
between
local
and
foreign
corporations?
justice
stevens
and
while
i've
interrupted
you,
would
the
issue
be
the
same
if,
say,
we
thought
of
it
in
terms
of
individual
income
tax
and
the
state
of
virginia
used
a
retaliatory
scheme
against,
say,
maryland
and
west
virginia,
and
so
that
a
maryland
citizen
working
in
virginia
paid
one
tax
rate
to
virginia
and
a
west
virginia
citizen
working
across
the,
commuting
across,
might
pay
a
different
rate.
is
that
the
same
issue?
justice
stevens
but
in
equal
protection
terms,
would
it
be
the
same
issue?
justice
stevens
the
idea
being
that--
justice
stevens
--i'm
assuming
the
mccarran
act
has
taken
all
the
commerce
clause
issues
out
of
the
case.
we
just
have
an
equal
protection
issue.
justice
stevens
california
is
trying
to
encourage
interstate
insurance
commerce
by
charging
out-of-state
companies
more?
justice
stevens
well,
may
i
ask--
--i
just
want
to
just
leave
one
question,
and
then
i'll
be
still.
is
it
the
same...
would
you
contend
that
it
would
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
for
virginia
to
discriminate
between
maryland
and
west
virginia
nonresidents
working
in
virginia,
for
the
same
purpose
underlying
the
statute,
to
try
and
induce
those
states
to
lower
their
income
tax
rates?
justice
stevens
--general
laddish,
i
was
unsuccessful
with
regard
to
the
income
tax.
would
the
principle
that
underlies
this
tax,
namely
motivating
other
legislatures
to
keep
their
tax
rates
down,
also
apply
to
say,
a
sales
tax,
where
we're
talking
about
sales
by
out-of-state
corporations,
and
you
might...
could
you
have
a
retaliatory
sales
tax
that
would
be
equally
justified,
or
is
there
something
special
about
the
insurance?
justice
stevens
but
you're
not
arguing
that
there's
anything
unique
about
insurance,
other
than
the
history
with
the
mccarran
act?
so,
in
terms
of
equal
protection,
it
would
be
the
same
with
an
automobile
business
or
steel
business
or
whatever
it
might
be?
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
the
equal
protection
principle,
it
is
that
that
discrimination
that
would
otherwise
be
impermissible
may
be
justified
as
rational
if
the
motivation
of
it
is
to
motivate
the
legislature
of
the
state
from
which
the
nonresident
comes
to
take
some
special
action.
you
discriminate
against
residents
of
california
and
ohio
because
you
want
to
put
pressure
on
that
legislature
to
take
favorable
action.
justice
stevens
that's
giving
a...
excusing
a
requirement,
that
you
make
them
take
a
six-hour
exam
when
nobody
else
did
because
they
had
a
six-hour
exam
elsewhere.
