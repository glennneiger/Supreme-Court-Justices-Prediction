mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
first
we
should
clear
the
record
as
to
one
question
which
i
do
not
think
is
determinative
of
this
case
or
actually,
strictly
relevant
to
the
case.
but
it's
been
raised
many
times
by
the
other
side
and
in
an
effort
to
apparently
color
the
case
in
the
favor
of
western
and
southern,
and
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
ohio
law
itself
discriminates
against
foreign
insurers.
now,
from
the
presentation
we
have
heard
today
and
the
presentation
in
the
briefs,
one
would
understand
that
ohio
does
not
discriminate
against
out-of-state
insurers
when
they
come
in.
this
is
not
the
case.
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
american
insurance
association
and
their
fellow
associations,
and
particularly
the
appendix
a
of
that
brief.
there
is
set
forth
the
ohio
statutes
which
set
forth
what
mr.
vogeler
has
characterized
as
this
complex
formula
as
far
as
ohio
domestic
insurers.
it's
clear,
as
mr.
vogeler
says,
that
foreign
insurance
companies
coming
into
ohio
will
be
taxed
at
a
rate
of
2.5
percent
of
their
premiums'
measure.
that's
certainly
clear
under
section
5729.03.
that's
on
page
2a
of
this
appendix.
for
domestic
insurers
sections
5725.18
and.19
cover
the
tax
that
is
to
be
charged.
there
there
is
a
choice
excuse
me,
it's
not
a
choice;
there
are
alternatives
given
as
far
as
how
the
tax
will
be
computed
for
an
ohio
insurance
company.
one
of
those
alternatives
is
the
alternative,
the
only
basis
upon
which
california
companies
or
any
other
state's
companies
will
be
taxed.
it
works
out
so
that
if
you
multiply
the
revenue,
the
premiums
measured
by
the
8-1/3
figure
that's
given
in
subparagraph
(b)
of
5725.18,
multiply
the
premiums
measure
by
that
8-1/3,
and
then
multiply
that
result
again
by
the.03
that
is
given
in
the
5725.19,
you
end
up
with
exactly
the
same
2.5
percent
rate
that's
charged
out-of-state
insurers.
that's
only
one
of
the
alternatives
that's
given
to
the
domestic
companies.
5725.18
says
you
shall
take
the
lesser
of
two
alternatives.
the
other
alternative
is
based
on
the
surplus
and
capital
of
the
company.
you
arrive
at
a
figure
and
multiply
that
by
the.03
that
is
given
in
section
5725.19.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
they
are
irrelevant,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
california
tax;
that
is
true.
my
point,
however,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
as
important
in
that
it
colors
the
arguments
from
the
other
side,
including
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
emphasizes
in
its
question
presented
and
several
times
during
the
course
of
the
brief,
including
four
separate
times
on
page
10
of
its
brief,
that
the
ohio
tax
is
nondiscriminatory
and
there
is
a
very
serious
question
in
my
mind
from
reading
in
that
brief
as
to
whether
the
solicitor
general
would
be
in
this
case
if
he
understood
what
ohio
law
actually
provides.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
that
is
true.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
right.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
but,
your
honor,
i
think
where
we
need
to
keep
things
straight
is
the
fact
of
whether
we're
talking
about
the
basic
premiums
tax
law
or
talking
about
the
retaliatory
tax
law.
here,
the
ohio
law
i'm
referring
to
is
the
basic
ohio
law.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
will
move
on
to
the--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well,
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
case,
your
honor,
because
there's--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--equal
protection
terms,
when
we
get
into
that,
it
would
be--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--very
similar,
and
yet
you
cannot
ignore
the
fact
that
here
we
have
an
interstate
business,
that
the
business
of
insurance
is
an
interstate,
is
in
interstate
commerce,
where
the
congress
has
removed
the
commerce
clause...
upon
the
state.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
but
remaining,
your
honor,
is
what
is
left,
and
what
can
the
states
do
to
perhaps
take
up
the
slack
a
bit
and
protect
this
interstate
commerce
on
their
own
behalf?
and
there
is
where
you
find
a
very
strong
interest
here
of
the
retaliatory
tax
in
trying
to
encourage
interstate
insurance
commerce
and
in
trying
to
keep
the
rates
somewhat
uniform
and--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--that's
what
i
have
to
convince
you
of,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--your
honor,
i
have
not
considered
that
out
of
the
current
context
of
the
case,
which
i
think
is
a
very
special
case.
and
we,
of
course,
under
those
circumstances
there
are
privileges
and
immunities
would
also
be
applying,
and
this
sort
of
thing.
but
in
the
equal
protection
standard,
i
think
this
is
a
very
special
case
because
of
the
commerce
clause
facts,
which
i
will
refer
to.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
your
honor...
for
purposes
of
the
california
tax,
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
mechanism
that
there
must
be
a
determination
in
ohio.
that
was
changed
in
1964.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
i
think
it
is
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not...
it
certainly,
the
retaliatory
tax
is
certainly
more
than
one
purpose,
which
i
will
be
getting
to.
one
of
the
purposes
is
to
counteract
discrimination
where
it
exists.
the
point
i
was
making
right
now
was
that
it
does
indeed
exist--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--that's
part
of
it,
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
and
the...
also,
it's
to
keep
the
lid
on
from
ohio
doing
anything
more
and
charge
any
higher
charges
upon
the
california
companies.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
there
has
not
been
a
change
in
the
ohio
tax
since
the
current
california
retaliatory
tax
statutes
came
into
effect.
now,
whether
it
has
kept
the
lid
on
and
kept
ohio
from
doing
more
and
increasing
its
insurance
tax
rate,
i
would
say
that's
a
very,
very
good
question
as
to
whether
or
not
ohio's
insurance
tax
rate
on
foreign
companies
might
be
quite
a
bit
greater.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
sprang
to
that
answer.
what
i
mean
is,
i
do
not
think
that
discrimination,
internal
discrimination
in
the
other
state,
is
necessary
to
support
a
tax
such
as
ours.
there
are
these
other
issue,
your
honor,
other
than
just
the
reducing.
the
point
i...
and
i'll
get
off
this
now,
as
far
as
the
ohio
taxes
go,
the
court
is...
the
past
practice
of
the
court
has
been
to
take
judicial
notice
of
matters
in
appeals
from
state
courts
that
that
state
appellate
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of,
and
in
the
current
case,
i
would
cite
the
court
to
section
452(a)
for
taking
judicial
notice
of
the...
this
is
evidence
code
of
the
state
of
california...
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
ohio
laws,
and
also
section
452
(c)
which
permits
california
courts
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
official
acts
of
the
executive
department
of
the
states
involved.
i
mention
that
one
because
the
amicus,
american
insurance
association,
has
also
lodged
with
the
court
in
this
document
the
tax
forms
upon
which
the
examiner
for
the
superintendent
of
insurance
of
ohio,
pursuant
to
the
ohio
statute,
to
5725.9,
has
computed
western
and
southern's
tax
liabilities
for
the
past
few
years.
if
one
follows
through
this
form,
one
will
easily
see
that
western
and
southern
itself
has
paid
only
36
percent
of
the
taxes
due
ohio
that
a
california
company
would
pay
to
ohio
under
the
basic
ohio
insurance
tax.
now,
western
and
southern
has
mentioned
in
its
briefs
the
stipulation
that
we
reached
as
to
these
earlier
california
trial
court
decisions
about
ohio
law.
i
would
just
merely
point
out
that
the
mechanics
of
the
california
retaliatory
tax
means
that
those
decisions
were
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
level
of
business
western
and
southern
was
doing
in
california
at
that
time,
and
presumably
this
lower
alternative
was
not
available
to
western
and
southern,
would
not
be
available
to
western
and
southern
under
those
facts
for
years
1959
and
1960.
until
now
there's
been
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
any
later
years
after
1960.
now,
i'll
move
on
from
what
i
have
said
that's
irrelevant
to
begin
with.
the
purpose
of
the
california
retaliatory
tax
is
not
to
raise
revenue.
that,
as
the
california
courts
have
recognized,
is
purely
incidental.
any
revenue
that
is
raised
is
purely
incidental.
in
fact,
the
more
successful
the
tax
is...
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out...
the
less
revenues
will
be
raised
in
that
if
it
were
successful
those
foreign
taxes
will
tend
to
lower.
now,
that
is
true
because
the
true
purpose,
which
is
a
multi-faceted
purpose
of
this
tax,
is
to
help
california
insurance
companies
attain
evenhanded
tax
treatment
when
they
do
business
in
the
other
states.
if
this
is
fully
achieved,
everyone's
tax
level
will
be
the
same--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--right
now
i
am
trying
to...
i
will
tie
in
all
the
rules.
i
really
would...
i'm
presenting
in
abstract
what
the
purpose
is
and
what
the
mechanics
are.
and
i
think
if
we
understand
that,
then
the
constitutional
rules
and
standards
are
easily
applied
to
show
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax.
the
purpose
that
i
mentioned
as
fully
achieved...
if
it
is,
then
there
is
no
retaliatory
tax
collectible,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
california
premiums
tax,
the
basic
tax
california
applies
to
all
insurers
would
only
have
to
be
raised
0.01
percent
from
2.35
percent
to
2.36
percent
in
order
to
take
up
the
slack,
if
the
retaliatory
tax
were
repealed.
so
the
revenue
is
purely
incidental.
the
further
purposes
of
the
tax
are
to
counteract
discrimination
between...
internal
discrimination
of
other
states
that
california
companies
might
experience,
such
as
could
be
experienced
in
ohio.
they
are
to
encourage...
retaliatory
taxes
are
to
encourage
uniformity
of
tax
burdens
throughout
the
united
states
and
thus
to
encourage
interstate
insurance
commerce.
now,
this
is
not
the
purpose
that
one
normally
finds
behind
a
state
tax,
although
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
there
are
other
state
statutes
and
there
are
federal
statutes
in
the
internal
revenue
code
that
have
similar
purposes.
the
existence
of
that
purpose
as
being
the
valid
purpose
in
this
case
and
the
relative
effectiveness
with
which
it
is
carried
out
is
demonstrated
here
by
who
is
supporting
the
state
of
california
in
this
case
as
to
the
insurance
tax
that
is
at
issue.
in
addition
to
the--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--no,
this
is
the
purpose
of
the
california
retaliatory
tax.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
it
certainly
will
become
clear
when
we
get
to
the
equal
protection
argument,
your
honor,
and
also
it
is
i
think
quite
important
here
because
i
don't
know
if
your
reaction
was
the
same
as
mine
when
i
first
heard
of
the
california
retaliatory
tax.
it
was
imposed
upon
some
foreign
insurers
and
not
upon
california
insurers.
my
reaction
was,
that
sounds
like
it
might
be
a
rather
touchy
issue.
i
am
trying
to
show
that
the
retaliatory
tax
is
in
fact
an
equalizing
tax.
it
does
have
reciprocal...
reciprocity
elements,
very
strong
reciprocity
elements.
it
does
have
this
purpose
that
it
is
not
a
revenue
purpose.
now,
as
i
was
pointing
out,
the
states
have
joined
us...
tennessee;
arizona;
wisconsin,
as
you
might
expect;
new
york
has
come
in
against
us
for
reasons
i
will
mention
in
a
little
bit.
but
very
significant
and
emphatic
amicus
support
comes
to
the
state
for
this
state
tax
by
the
nationwide
insurance
industry.
the
bulk
of
the
life
insurers
the
bulk
of
the
property
and
casualty
insurers
and
the
largest
casualty,
property
and
casualty
insurer
in
the
united
states,
have
all
come
in
in
favor
of
this
state
tax,
which
to
me
illustrates
that
they
recognize
that
the
elimination
of
this
tax
will
indeed
disrupt
the
relative
uniformity
that
we
now
have
amongst
state
tax
burdens
in
the
insurance
area,
and
will
soon
result...
if
the
retaliatory
tax
were
to
to
be
abolished...
in
a
significant
increase
in
their
tax
bills.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
well,
i
know,
your
honor,
but
there
have
been
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
california
stated
purpose,
whether
it
actually
works
is
just
pie-in-the-sky
rhetoric?
i
say,
showing
who
is
supporting
us...
i'm
not
trying
to
impress
you
by
the
personages
that
are
supporting
us,
i
am
trying
to
indicate
that
these
are
companies
that
have
their
own
auditors
and
they
work
things
out
as
far
as
what
is
to
their
benefit.
you
don't
often
have
insurance
companies
coming
in
and
say,
please
save
this
insurance
tax.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
there
are...
i
count
49
states
that
have
taxes
similar
to
ours.
north
carolina
has
the
statutory
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
be
applied
and
it
does
not
apply
it.
forty-eight
states
have
taxes
similar
to
ours.
that
would
include
new
mexico
which
has
a
retaliatory
tax
it
imposes
upon
brokers
and
agents,
not
upon
the
companies.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
your
honor.
i
see
no
reason
why
it
would
not.
the
appellant
has
tried
to
indicate
that
since
we
reimposed
the
retaliatory
tax
after
appellant
received
an
indefinite
term
of
a
license
to
do
business,
that
that
might
somehow
distinguish.
i'm
sure
that
attempt
at
distinguishing
this
case
would
fall
by
the
wayside
soon
if
this
court
were
to
knock
down
the
california
tax.
it's
clear
that
this
tax
conforms
with
all
constitutional
standards,
and
it's
also
clear
that
the
california
license
involved
was
conditioned
upon
continuing
to
conform
with
the
law.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
under
the
equal
protection
law,
your
honor,
yes.
i'm
not
sure
how
long
it
would
survive
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
am
not
arguing
here,
although
my
sister
state
tennessee
does
argue
in
its
brief
that
this
tax
would
be
valid
under
the
commerce
clause
without
the
mccarran
act,
so
i
don't
feel
as
if
i
can
concede
that
point
and
argue
against
my
co-state.
however--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--it
depends
on
exactly
what
we're
grouping
in
the
mccarran
act
milieu
there.
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
with
the
commerce
clause
not
applying
in
this
area,
then
if
these
california
insurance
companies
are
to
avoid
this
sort
of
discriminatory
taxes
that
this
court
affirmed
in
prudential
v.
benjamin,
where
it
assumed
that
the
tax
was
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce,
if
they're
going
to
try
and
keep
a
lid
on
that
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
states
to
do
it.
and
it's
important
to
realize
that
this
does
create
a
special
context
even
in
the
equal
protection
issue
in
that
if
the
equal
protection
clause
is
seen
as
having
a
federalistic
element,
this
is
a
tax
that
is
trying
to
keep
that
sort
of
discrimination
and
an
overburdening
of
the
insurance
industry
down.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
your
honor,
it's
very
similar
to
the
case
of
hawkins
v.
moss
that
is
cited
on
page
27
of
the
american
insurance
association
brief.
there
was
a
case
where
we
will
not
require
your
candidates
for
the
bar
to
take
a
law
exam,
bar
exam,
if
you
will
reciprocate.
and
that
is
certainly
putting
a
burden
on
those
individuals
saying,
you
have
to
take
a
bar
exam--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--i
don't
see
any
difference,
your
honor,
between
saying
you
have
to
take
this
exam,
and
saying
you
have
to
take
a
six-hour
exam.
i
think
if
two
people
walk
in,
one
from
west
virginia
and
one
from
colorado,
and
the
clerk
was
there
and
says,
let's
see
your
law.
you
have
to
take
the
exam;
you
don't
have
to
take
the
exam.
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
sort
of
point
we
have
here.
it
is
also
the
same
concern
and
same
purpose
and
same
sort
of
mechanisms
that
you
have
in
the
federal
cases,
or
federal
statutes,
under
the
internal
revenue
code
where
there
are
at
least
five
statutes
set
forth
in
the
american
insurance
association
brief
that
indicate
that
if
you...
that
as
to
foreign
countries,
other
sovereigns,
the
congress
by
imposing
burdens
or
withholding
benefits...
they
go
both
ways
on
those
statutes...
they
attempt
to
achieve
evenhanded
tax
treatment
for
those
u.s.
citizens
and
corporations
under
the
other
sovereign's
laws
and
they're...
although
these
are
set
forth,
by
the
way,
at
pages
23
though
26
of
the
american
insurance
association
brief.
there
the
equal
protection
standards
under
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply
to
the
federal
government
giving
the
rights
to
aliens
and
yet
the
federal
government
has
done
this.
one
of
the
statutes
in
original
form
was
enacted
in
1918,
and
the
federal
government
in
at
least
one
of
those
statutes,
896(b),
talks
about...
excuse
me;
it
was
896(a)...
is
triggered
by
exactly
the
same
thing,
more
burdensome
taxes,
not
discrimination
or
anything
else,
but
more
burdensome
taxes.
another
one
of
the
statutes,
896(b),
is
the
result
or
the
action
as
being,
we
will
impose
the
same
tax
that
you're
imposing
on
our
people.
so
we
have
other
sections
and
other
statutes,
including
these
federal
statutes
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
mechanics
of
the
tax,
i
think,
are
relatively
simple.
we
take...
and
this
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
western
and
southern
is
an
ohio
corporation,
and
so
once
the
california
basic
premiums
tax
liability
is
computed,
we
look
to
ohio
and
see
what
a
california
company
doing
the
level
of
business
done
by
western
and
southern
in
california
and
doing
the
same
type
of
business,
being
the
same
type
of
company
as
western
and
southern,
what
its
burden
in
ohio
would
be.
now,
if
that
burden
is
less
or
the
same,
there
is
no
retaliatory
tax
on
western
and
southern.
if
that
burden
is
more,
which
the
record
is
clear
and
there's
no
dispute
here,
the
ohio
burden
would
be
more
on
the
california
company,
then
there
is
the
tax,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
the
burden
would
be
more.
if
western
and
southern
were
to
convince
ohio
to
lower
the
burden
on
the
california
insurers
say
to
the...
or
give
the
california
insurers
the
same
alternatives
that
they're
giving
to
the
domestic
insurers
in
ohio,
then
the
california
retaliatory
tax,
as
long
as
that
ohio
burden
was
the
same
or
below
what
california's
burden
would
be,
would
disappear.
and
i
say
this
is
reciprocal
action.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
of
the
purposes,
in
addition
to
discrimination,
it's
to--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--or
below.
that's
when
the
retaliatory
tax
would
disappear.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
it
would
be
satisfied
if
ohio
reduced
the
tax
on
california
companies--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--well,
they
could.
but,
your
honor,
remember
we
have
96
percent
of
the
states
having
the
same
retaliatory
taxes.
now,
if
i
could
just
run
through,
as
far
as
the
constitutional
standards
that
need
to
be
applied,
western
and
southern
and
its
supporters
have
often
cited
authorities
from
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
now,
obviously,
those
do
not
apply
here;
we're
dealing
with
a
corporation.
as
to
the
commerce
clause,
i
submit
that
prudential
v.
benjamin
is
entirely
clear,
the
mccarran
act
is
entirely
clear,
and
the
application
of
prudential
and
the
mccarran
act
to
a
substantially
similar
retaliatory
tax
is
clear
through
the
decision
in
prudential
v.
hobbs.
so
i
leave
to
my
briefs
the
arguments
as
to
the
commerce
clause,
unless
there
are
questions
of
the
court.
one
point
is
that
congress,
if
it
were
unhappy
with
the
prudential
v.
benjamin
case
or
hobbs
case,
or
if
it
were
unhappy
with
what
the
states
were
doing
now
as
to
retaliatory
taxes,
could
change
the
system
at
any
time
by
amending
the
mccarran
act
or
repealing
it,
or
taking
over
the
field
itself
of
state
regulation
and
taxation
of
insurance
companies.
this
has
not
happened.
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
have
a
valid
state
purpose.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
contest
the
fact
that
the
purpose
i
have
outlined
is
a
valid
purpose.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
it's
slightly
different,
your
honor,
in
that
prudential
v.
benjamin
pointed
out
that
here
the
states
and
congress
have
acted
together
and
that
it
would
add
even
more
strength
to
the
presumption
that
the
state
tax
statute
is
constitutional
as
against
an
equal
protection
challenge
or
any
other
constitutional
challenges.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
they
do
mention,
your
honor--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--they
barely
mention--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--it
was
not
raised
by
prudential;
no,
your
honor.
but
the
court
did
take
care
to
say,
"no
conceivable
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
in
letter
or
in
spirit
is
presented
nor
is
contravention
of
any
other
limitation.
"
--this
is
on
page
436.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
it
does
not...
i'm
sure
you
and
i
are
both
aware...
but
i
am
not
relying
upon
benjamin
for--
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
--nor
the
mccarran
act,
your
honor,
directly.
i
think,
as
i
have
pointed
out
with
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
context
of
the
mccarran
act
is
quite
important.
but
here,
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
you
have
the
purpose
and
you
have
the
classification,
which
is
certainly
reasonably
related
to
the
attaining
of
that
purpose.
this
is
not
a
classification
where
all
foreign
insurers
are
lumped
together
and
suffer
discrimination.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
claim
that
this
is
in
the
special
level.
here
only
those
companies
whose
home
states
would
discriminate
or
would
raise
a
higher
burden
against
california
insurers
will
suffer
the
retaliatory
tax.
and
as
soon
as
that
burden
is
adjusted
down
to
the
california
level,
the
retaliatory
tax
will
disappear.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
yes,
your
honor,
the
state
of
incorporation.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
that
issue
has
never
arisen,
your
honor,
and
it
does
not
arise
in
this
case.
we
have
an
ohio
company
with
its
home
office
in
ohio.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
i
think,
your
honor,
you'll
find
that
that's
usually
the
case
with
insurance
companies.
i
do
not
know.
i
have
not...
there
is
no
study
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
g.
laddish
i
believe
so,
your
honor;
yes.
in
this
case
we
have
an
ohio
company
with
an
ohio
office.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
if
the
briefs
are
fully
followed
through
with
the
standards,
the
regular
standards
that
are
applied
in
equal
protection
cases,
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
and
a
reasonable
basis
for
classification
made
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
affirmed.
