mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
western
and
southern
life
insurance
company
is
one
of
1,957
legal
reserve
life
insurance
companies
that
as
of
january
1,
1980,
were
licensed
to
do
business
in
one
of
the
states
or
the
district
of
columbia.
western
and
southern
was
incorporated
as
a
stock
company
in
1888
and
in
1948
became
a
mutual
company.
at
january
1
of
1981
it
had
assets
in
excess
of
$3
billion,
and
life
insurance
in
force
of
over
$14
billion
and
thus
according
to
best's
insurance
reports,
it
ranks
25th
in
size
of
companies
and
45th
of
companies
in
size
of
life
insurance
in
force.
it's
licensed
to
do
business
in
41
states,
including
the
state
of
california.
it
obtained
the
certificate
of
authority
to
do
business
in
california
as
of
july
1,
1956,
and
has
carried
on
its
business
under
that
certificate
of
authority
granted
in
1956
for
the
last
25
years.
the
california
constitutional
provisions
and
the
retaliatory
tax
laws
of
california,
when
western
and
southern
became
qualified
to
do
business
there,
levied
a
tax
upon
out-of-state
insurers
which
was
called
a
retaliatory
tax
if
the
state
from
which
the
foreign
insurer
to
california
came
levied
a
higher
tax
on
california
insurers
doing
business
in
those
foreign
states
than
it
did
upon
its
own
insurers.
and
when
the
state
legislature
implemented
that
statute
in
1959,
western
and
southern
went
to
court,
and
it
was
determined
in
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court
in
1962
that
no
retaliatory
tax
could
be
assessed
against
western
and
southern
under
the
california
constitutional
provision
and
law
then
in
effect
because
the
state
of
ohio
did
not
levy
higher
taxes
on
foreign
insurance
companies
doing
business
in
ohio
than
they
did
on
foreign
insurance
companies
coming
into
the
state
from
outside.
however,
in
november,
1964,
the
california
constitution
was
amended
to
authorize
a
retaliatory
tax
on
out-of-state
insurers
in
california
merely
when
the
state
of
origin
of
that
insurance
company
levied
a
tax
on
foreign
insurance
companies
that
was
higher
than
california
levied.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
reciprocity,
your
honor,
is
a
situation
in
which
one
state
recognizes
and
defers
to
legislation
or
some
comity
in
another
state.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
our
situation
here
is,
because
california
does
not
lower
its
tax
if
a
foreign
state
has
a
lower
tax.
it
merely
raised
their
tax
up
to
a
foreign
state's
tax.
there
is
no
reciprocity.
but
this
is
what,
of
course,
the
attorney
general
of
california
would
like
this
court
to
believe.
we
will
expand
on
the
fact
that
this
is
not
reciprocity,
this
is
not
comity.
california
taxes,
whether
or
not
ohio
discriminates
on
california
corporations,
and
levies
a
higher
tax
on
the
foreign
insurance
company
doing
business
in
california.
the
california
constitutional
amendment
in
1964
had
the
effect
of
levying
this
tax
on
out-of-state
insurers
when
the
out-of-state,
the
foreign
state
of
origin
of
the
company
doing
business
in
california
had
a
higher
tax
rate
than
california
did.
now,
california's
tax
rate,
actually,
is
higher
than
32
other
states.
but
ohio's
tax
rate
is
higher
than
california's.
so
the
question
of
the
validity
of
this
california
retaliatory
tax
is
therefore
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
claim,
and
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court
found,
that
this
kind
of
a
tax,
which
he
referred
to
as
a
comparative
retaliatory
tax
where
the
tax
burdens
of
different
states
were
compared,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
yes,
your
honor.
the
discriminatory
tax
is
one
which
levies
a
tax
when
the
foreign
state
discriminates.
the
retaliatory
tax,
the
comparative
retaliatory
tax,
is
one
that
is
levied
when
the
foreign
state
merely
levies
a
higher
burden.
the
discriminatory
tax
is
one
which
is
aimed
at
the
foreign
state
which
levies
higher
taxes
on
foreign
companies
than
on
its
own
companies.
that
is
the
anti-discriminatory
retaliatory
tax.
that
is
no
longer
the
tax
we
have
in
california,
your
honor.
we
have
the
comparative
tax,
the
comparative
retaliatory
tax
which
merely
measures
the
comparative
tax
burdens
in
ohio
and
california.
and
this
is
the
tax
which
is
in
effect
in
most
of
the
states
of
the
union.
we
claim
that
this
tax
in
california
is
invalid,
violating
not
only
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
but
also
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
this
is
also
what
the
judge
found
in
the
trial
court.
now,
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
that.
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
it
on
the
basis
of
its
understanding
of
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
prudential
v.
benjamin
and
prudential
v.
hobbs.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
it
is
one
tax,
your
honor.
it
is
a
retaliatory
tax.
a
return
is
filed
and
an
amount
is
paid.
it
is
not
the
premiums
tax
which
all
insurance
companies
pay.
it
is
not
the
real
property
tax,
which
all
of
the
insurance
companies
pay.
it
is
a
retaliatory
tax
determined
by
the
use
of
a
retaliatory
form
which
measures
the
tax
burden
of
california
against
the
tax
burden
of
the
state
of
origin
of
the
incoming
company.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
california
still
levies
its
normal
tax.
it
does
not
reciprocate,
your
honor.
now,
there
is
another
issue
in
this
case
and
that's
another
provision
of
california
law
in
which
california
granted,
a
law
that
is
now
repealed
as
of
1977,
granted
a
credit
against
the
premiums
tax
for
all
california
insurers
for
their
real
property
taxes
that
they
paid
on
their
home
office
buildings
in
california.
they
also
granted
a
credit
to
foreign
companies
against
their
gross
premium
tax
if
the
foreign
company
had
an
office
in
california
and
occupied
75
percent
or
more
of
the
office.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
california
court
of
appeal
has
said,
but
that
is
not,
however,
your
honor,
what
the
local
court,
the
los
angeles
superior
court,
said.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
it
has
been
repealed,
but
in
all
of
the
years
in
issue
in
this
case
it's
presently
in
effect.
it
affects
the
years
we
have
before
the
court.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
yes,
your
honor.
the
los
angeles
superior
court
also
found
that
that
was
an
undue
discrimination,
it
violated
due
process,
and
it
violated
equal
protection
for
the
california
companies
to
get
this
credit
against
their
premiums
tax
and
for
a
company
like
western
and
southern
who
did
have
an
office
building...
it's
a
lovely
office
building
on
wilshire
boulevard
which
it
spent
a
lot
of
money
for
and
pays
a
lot
of
taxes
for,
but
it
doesn't
get
the
same
credit
that
the
california
companies
get,
because
western
and
southern
didn't
occupy
75
percent
of
the
building,
and
therefore
was
limited
to
a
credit
equal
to
the
percentage
of
its
real
property
taxes,
equal
to
the
percentage
of
the
building
occupied
by
itself.
now,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
stated,
the
court
of
appeal
of
california
reversed
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court,
and
it
is
the
validity
of
that
reversal
which
we
are
concerned
with
today.
now,
the
legal
issues
we
think
are
twofold.
one,
did
this
court
in
prudential
insurance
company
v.
benjamin
and
prudential
insurance
company
v.
hobbs
in
1945
give
free
rein
in
1946
to
the
states
to
levy
whatever
burden
they
wanted
to
on
insurance
companies
doing
business
in
interstate
commerce?
and
if
that
question
is
answered
in
the
affirmative,
then
did
those
two
cases
also
authorize
the
states
to
violate
the
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution?
we
submit--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--i'm
sorry;
i
did
not
hear,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
well,
i
will
explain
where
i
think--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--where
i
think
that
there
may
not
have
been
the
equal
protection
issue
that
is
before
court.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
the
words
may
have
been
there,
your
honor.
correct.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
court
has
said
it
has
not
done
that
in
mccarran-ferguson
act.
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
trial
court
found
this
california
retaliatory
tax
to
be
discriminatory,
and
nobody
says
that
it
isn't
discriminatory.
neither
the
appellee,
the
attorney
general
of
california,
nor
any
of
the
amici
on
their
side
say
that
this
isn't
discriminatory.
what
they
say
is
that
this
court
authorized
this
discrimination
when
it
interpreted
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
in
1946.
now,
what
they
say
really
is
that
this
type
of
discrimination
was
approved
by
this
court
in
hobbs,
prudential
insurance
company
v.
hobbs.
now,
the
hobbs
case,
decided
on
june
10,
'46,
before
any
of
the
members
of
this
court
had
come
to
the
court
either
as
justices
or
as
clerks,
said
as
follows:
"the
entire
case
#"--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--a
couple
of
years.
"appeals
for
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
"
"june
10,
1946.
"
"per
curiam,
the
judgments
are
affirmed.
"
"prudential
insurance
company
v.
benjamin,
328
u.s.
408;
robertson
v.
california
328
u.s.
440.
"
that's
the
entire
language
of
this
court.
now,
let's
go
down
below
to
the
kansas
supreme
court.
there
were
16
insurance
companies
who
had
cases
involved
in
the
court
entitled,
"in
re
kansas,
in
re
insurance
tax
cases,
at
160
kansas
300.
"
there
were
three
types
of
taxes
involved.
they
were
a
fireman's
relief
fund
tax,
a
premiums
tax,
and
a
retaliatory
tax.
none
of
the
companies
subject
to
the
retaliatory
tax
had
qualified
to
do
business
in
kansas
before
the
retaliatory
tax
was
enacted.
and
what
did
the
kansas
supreme
court
say
with
respect
to
all
of
these
laws?
here's
what
they
said
in
their
own
syllabus:
"(1)
our
statutes
pertaining
to
insurance
were
not
rendered
void
by
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
united
states
v.
southeastern
underwriters
association.
"
that
was
their
first
premise
of
law.
second,
"congress
did
not
exceed
its
powers
in
passing
public
law
no.
15
of
the
79th
congress,
first
session.
"
"that's
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
"
and
third,
"mandamus
will
not
be
allowed
to
compel
an
executive
officer.
"
--they
wanted
a
license
to
be
issued.
"mandamus
will
not
be
allowed
to
compel
an
executive
officer
to
do
something
contrary
to
a
statute
unless
it
is
is
clear
that
the
statute
is
void.
"
so
the
memorandum
opinion
issued
by
this
court
in
hobbs
could
do
no
more
than
affirm
the
foregoing
propositions
of
law.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
my
jurisdictional?
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
well,
they...
they--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--the
questions
presented
in
hobbs,
your
honor,
were
whether
or
not
the
kansas
laws
were
valid.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--retaliatory
law.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
retaliatory
tax.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
there
was
a
retaliatory
tax,
your
honor,
absolutely.
however,
the
kansas
supreme
court
said
in
its
decision,
"we
find
no
evidence
that
the
tax
burden
on
the
foreign
states
doing
an
insurance
business
in
kansas
are
any
higher
than
they
are
on
the
kansas
insurance
companies
who
are
doing
business
as
native
companies.
"
so
there
is
no
retaliation,
there
is
no
discrimination...
pardon
me,
your
honor.
there
is
no
discrimination
that
was
found
to
be
existing
in
the
kansas
supreme
court.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
the
kansas
supreme
court,
your
honor,
in
that
case--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
tax
is
somewhat
the
same--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--your
honor,
the
cases...
there
were
only...
the
only
companies
in
the
kansas
cases
which
paid
a
retaliatory
tax
were
texas
companies.
there
were
three
of
them.
they
were
the
only
ones
that
were
subject
to
the
retaliatory
law.
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
those
companies
paid
a
higher
tax
than
kansas
companies
paid.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
well,
there
is
no--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
is
not
whether
there
is
discrimination--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--it
has
been
interpreted
that
way.
your
honor,
and
it's
certainly
urged
in
that
way
by
the
california
attorney
general,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
to
my
best
knowledge,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
well,
your
honor,
that's
a--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--what
i
wanted
to
say
about
both
benjamin
and
hobbs
is
that
in
the
benjamin
case
we
were
dealing
with
a
south
carolina
premium
statute.
we
were
not
dealing
in
benjamin
with
a
retaliatory
statute.
so
there
was
no
question
in
the
benjamin
case
of
the
validity
of
retaliatory
tax
laws.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--that
is
also
true,
your
honor.
the
doctrine
of
lincoln
life
insurance
company
v.
read
was
still
in
effect,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
corporation
could
be
charged
coming
into
a
state
a
different
fee
or
a
different
tax
than
a
creature
of
that
own
state.
when
a
company
is
coming
into
a
state
standing
on
the
threshold,
it
may
be
valid
for
a
corporate
tax
to
be
placed
on
that
corporation
which
is
higher
or
different
from
the
tax
that
is
levied
on
the
local
corporation.
now,
we
are
getting
into
somewhat
of
a
discussion
of
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
which
this
court
i
believe
is
now
fostering,
and
it
may
be
that
the
lincoln
life
insurance
company
case
v.
read
may
not
again
be
decided
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
decided
at
that
time.
but
this
is
the
concept
that
was
involved
in
the
benjamin
case,
namely,
a
company
coming
into
the
state
of
carolina
was
subjected
to
a
higher
tax
than
carolina
companies--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--i
think
he
said
that
the
mccarran
act
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
and
i
urge--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--therefore
that
there
could
be
discrimination?
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
well,
i
think
that
is
what
he
said,
your
honor;
yes.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
i
confess
to
the
court
that
my
position
is
stronger
with
my
second
point
which
is,
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process,
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
in
any
event,
we
suggest
that
this
court
is
the
final
arbiter
of
the
meaning
and
effect
of
its
decisions.
as
i
say,
we
believe
the
california
court
of
appeal
interpreted
prudential
v.
benjamin
and
prudential
v.
hobbs
incorrectly,
but
if
we
are
wrong
we
urge
this
court
to
reexamine
those
cases
and
to
distinguish
them
on
the
basis
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
does
not
authorize
discriminatory
taxation
against
interstate
commerce
where
such
discrimination
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
laws.
apart
from
the
commerce
clause,
equal
protection
of
laws.
then
as
our
second--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--no,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
i
want
you
to
distinguish
your
former
treatment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
so
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
other
constitutional
guarantees.
i
feel
that
if
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
takes
away
all
protections
to
foreign
insurance
companies
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
which
is
what
the
attorney
general
of
california
would
have
you
say
and
what
you
may
already
have
said,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
is
particularly
important
that
this
court
be
zealous
in
reserving
and
protecting
the
only
remaining
rights
that
there
are
to
these
foreign
insurance
companies
under
the
constitution,
and
those
are
the
rights
guaranteed
to
them
under
the
fourteenth
amendment:
due
process,
equal
protection--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--i
believe
it
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
oh,
no,
your
honor.
ohio
levies
on
foreign
companies
into
the
state
a
premiums
tax
of
2.5
percent.
california
levies
a
tax
of
2.35--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--with
request
to
domestic
corporations,
your
honor,
there
is
a
complicated
formula
and
it--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--has
been
held
that
the
use
of
that
formula,
in
three
different
cases,
meant
that
ohio
did
not
discriminate
against
foreign
insurance
companies
in
ohio.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
no,
your
honor.
and
that
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
things
that
we
discuss
here,
because
we
feel
that
contrary
to
what
the
attorney
general
would
have
you
believe,
and
contrary
to
what
the
amici
in
support
of
the
california
statute
would
have
you
believe,
this
type
of
legislation,
this
retaliatory
legislation
does
not
promote
comity.
it
doesn't
promote
equal-handed
treatment,
evenhanded
treatment.
it
doesn't
promote
even
taxation
of
foreign
corporations.
let's
look
at
the
california
law.
they
say
that
17
states
only
levy
higher
taxes
on
foreign
insurance
companies
than
california,
and
therefore
it
indicates
that
there's
a
great
leveling
of
taxes
on
foreign
corporations.
but
31
states
levy
a
lower
tax
on
foreign
insurance
companies
than
california
does,
so
that
when
those
companies
which
are
created
in
california
come
into
any
one
of
the
other
32
states
they
have
a
retaliatory
tax
to
pay.
so
there's
nothing
magic
about
what
california's
doing.
the
only
time
you've
got
comity
is
because
you've
got
oklahoma.
in
oklahoma
that's
the
highest
tax
of
all,
four
percent.
so
every
oklahoma
company
that
does
business
in
any
other
state
pays
a
retaliatory
tax.
in
california,
western
and
southern
pays
a
tax
of
the
difference
between
2.35,
the
california
rate,
and
the
ohio
rate,
2.5,
or
0.15
of
a
percent
of
their
premium
income.
oklahoma
pays
a
1.65
percent,
companies
from
oklahoma
pay
a
1.65
percent
of
premium
tax,
eleven
times
what
ohio
pays.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
oklahoma
companies
have
a
four
percent--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--they
have
a
four
percent
tax
levied
in
oklahoma
on
a
foreign
insurance
company.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
and,
consequently,
when
they
go
into
california,
which
levies
only
a
2.35
percent
tax,
the
retaliatory
tax
picks
up--
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
--the
1.65,
eleven
times
higher
than
ohio
pays.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
if
we
look
at
the
exhibit
b
in
the
jerome
hellerstein
brief
which
lists
all
the
tax
rates
of
all
the
states,
we
could
come
up
with
all
sorts
of
combinations
of
what
kinds
of
taxes
are
paid
by
the
various
companies
from
different
states
doing
business
in
other
states.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
the
due
process
argument,
your
honor,
emphasizes
that
the
mere
incorporation
of
a
state
in
another
state
is
no
warrant
or
authority
for
the
imposition
of
discriminatory
taxation.
and
you,
mr.
justice
brennan,
said
that
yourself
in
the
allied
stores
case
and
i
think
your
language
discussed
the
matter
of
our
federalism,
the
comity
that
we
have
between
states,
and
you
said,
our
constitution
is
an
instrument
of
federalism.
you
referred
to
the
common
and
continuing
problem
of
constitutional
interpretation,
of
adjusting
the
demands
of
individual
states
to
regulate
and
tax
enterprises
in
light
of
the
multi-state
nature
of
our
federation.
the
equal
protection
clause,
among
its
other
roles,
operates
to
maintain
this
principle
of
federalism.
and
you
pointed
out
that
the
wheeling
steel
case
held
a
tax
law
unconstitutional
because
it
discriminated
against
an
out-of-state
company,
whereas
the
allied
stores
case
was
held
valid
because
ohio
was
discriminating
against
its
own
citizens
in
favor
of
a
foreign
corporation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
yes.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
thank
you.
first,
let
me
say
that
if
we
are
in
error
about
the
ohio
law
not
discriminating
against
foreign
corporations,
it
is
an
error
that
has
been
propounded
by
the
california
courts
which
on
three
different
occasions
in
suits
to
levy
taxes
upon
western
and
southern
because
of
the
ohio
law,
found
that
the
ohio
law
did
not
discriminate,
and
those
cases
are
referred
to
in
our
brief.
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
purpose
is
for
talking
about
western
and
southern's
income
taxes
are,
and
the
materials
which
has
been
submitted
by
the
brief
for
the
property
insurers
are
obviously
not
western
and
southern
tax
returns
but
they
are
work-ups
from,
perhaps
those
returns,
by
employees
of
the
ohio
department
of
insurance.
the
question
of
discrimination
is
obvious
in
this
legislation.
not
only
do
we
have
discrimination
between
states,
we
have
discrimination
within
states.
for
example,
under
the
california
retaliatory
tax
law
a
life
insurance
company
from
virginia
doing
business
in
california
pays
no
retaliatory
tax
at
all,
but
a
property
insurance
company
from
virginia
doing
business
in
california
pays
a
0.4
percent
of
premium
retaliatory
tax.
is
that
equal
protection?
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
yes,
your
honor.
as
in
every
case,
in
every
state
with
respect
to
attorneys,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
which
has
the
right
to
control
the
practice
of
law
within
that
state.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
same
principle
is
involved.
mr.
alan
r.
vogeler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
we're
talking
about
in
that
case,
i
say,
police
power
where
there
is
a
particular
interest
within
the
state.
now
what
interest
does
the
state
of
california
have
as
to
what
a
tax
levy
is
in
the
state
of
ohio?
i
say
to
you
that
no
state
should
have
to
conform
its
own
revenue
statutes
to
the
configuration
of
another
state.
and
this
court
has
said
so
also,
in
austin
v.
new
hampshire.
no
state
should
try
to
impose
its
insurance
tax
structure
on
another
state.
a
state
should
be
free
to
levy
its
insurance
taxes
on
insurance
companies
in
accordance
with
its
own
needs,
not
because
the
state
of
california
wants
to
equalize
the
taxes
all
over
the
country,
or
wants
to
equalize
taxes
among
companies
that
are
going
to
be
doing
business
there
but
are
from
california.
the
discrimination
inherent
in
retaliatory
taxation
found
to
exist
in
the
unchallenged
findings
of
the
superior
court
of
california
that
it
is
unconstitutional
should
be
upheld
by
this
court.
it
is
fundamentally
wrong.
