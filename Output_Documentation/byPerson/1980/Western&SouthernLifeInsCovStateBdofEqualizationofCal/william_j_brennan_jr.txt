justice
jr.
mr.
vogeler,
in
your
equal
protection
argument,
has
the
california
statute
had
any
impact
on
tax
laws
in
ohio,
to
reduce
them
or?
justice
jr.
are
they
the
same
tax,
same
rate
of
tax,
whether
it's
a
domestic
or
foreign
corporation?
justice
jr.
well,
what's
ohio
do
as
to
domestic
corporations?
justice
jr.
different
from
the
foreign?
justice
jr.
but
the
california
laws
had
no
impact
on
reducing
the
tax
rates
for
either
domestic
or
foreign
corporations?
justice
jr.
and
your
due
process
argument
emphasizes
what,
mr.
vogeler?
justice
jr.
mr.
laddish,
i
just
want
to
be
clear
in
your
response
to
my
brother
stewart
a
moment
ago.
is
it
your
position
that
appellant's
equal
protection
argument
is
neither
helped
nor
hurt
by
whatever
the
situation
may
be
in
ohio?
justice
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
asked--
justice
jr.
--well,
what
that
means
to
me,
mr.
laddish,
is
that
california's
purpose
is,
if
possible,
to
get
ohio...
since
we're
dealing
with
ohio
corporations
doing
business
in
california...
so
to
adjust
its
tax
structure
as
to...
over
it,
so
that
you
don't
have
to
charge
the
higher
rate,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
vogeler
suggested
that
he
did
not
think
that
the
california
tax
had
had
any
impact
whatever
on
the
ohio
tax
structure,
to
change
it
in
any
way.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
jr.
well,
do
you
think
it's
a
sufficient
defense
for
the
california
tax
if
the
only
purpose
were
to
try
to
get
other
states
to
lower
theirs?
justice
jr.
you
think
that's
enough
of
a
defense
against--
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
it
wouldn't
be
enough,
as
i
understand
it,
to
prevent
the
application
of
the
california
tax
that
ohio
increased
the
rate
for
both
domestic
and
foreign
companies
to
the
same
level,
but
higher
than
california?
justice
jr.
you'd
still
tax
the
ohio
corporation
in
california
on
the
difference.
justice
jr.
so
the
only
thing
that
would
satisfy
california
is
if
your
tax
law
had
the
impact
of
compelling
the
ohio
legislature
or
leading
them,
in
any
event,
to
reducing
the
tax
on
at
least
the
foreign
corporation
below
the
california
tax?
justice
jr.
not
on
foreign
corporations?
if
they
pick
california
companies
out--
justice
jr.
and
it's
only
the
rationale
of
the
level
of
scrutiny
that
applies.
