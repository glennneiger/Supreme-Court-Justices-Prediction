justice
rehnquist
mr.
vogeler?
justice
rehnquist
in
the
opinion
of
the
california
court
of
appeal,
the
taxes
are
variously
referred
to
as
discriminatory,
comparative,
and
new
you
characterize
it
as
retaliatory.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
only
one
tax
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
been
repealed,
hasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
it
affects
the
judgment
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
and
congress
does
have
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enact
legislation
out
the
amendment,
does
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
non-kansas
and
non-texas
companies.
other
foreign
insurance
companies
paid
a
lower
tax
than
the
texas
companies
did.
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
asking
us
to
reconstrue
or
reexamine
the
construction
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
but
simply
to
say,
contrary
to
what
we
said
some
years
ago,
that
that
act
does
constitute
any
violation
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
laddish,
you
have
dealt
at
some
length
with
the
purpose
of
the
ohio
tax.
justice
rehnquist
or
of
the
california
tax,
and
ordinarily
in
a
state
tax
case
it's
presumed,
you
know,
one
state
may
tax
income
at
ten
percent,
another
at
30
percent,
and
we
don't
inquire
into
why
one
state
chose
to
tax
at
ten
percent
and
another
at
30
percent.
so,
why
is
your
purpose
argument
relevant
here?
justice
rehnquist
but
we're
not
candidates
for
honorary
membership
in
any
of
those
amicus
organizations.
we
have
to
decide
according
to
the
law,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
sun
belt
non-reciprocative
admissions
to
the
bar?
you
can't
get
admitted
to
the
bar
in
california
or
arizona
or
florida
without
taking
a
test,
although
in
most
other
states,
if
you've
been
admitted
to
practice
in
one
of
them,
you
can
get
admitted
to
the
other
simply
on
motion.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
we're
talking
about
state
power
whether
it's
exercised
by
a
court
or
by
a
legislature.
