justice
white
well,
what
if
the
tax
in
the
other
jurisdiction
on
california
companies
is
lower?
california
still
keeps
its
tax
the
way
it
is?
justice
white
well,
the
equal
protection
issue
was
in
benjamin,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
there
was
an
equal
protection
issue
in
benjamin.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
what
did
the
jurisdictional
statement
raise
as
an
issue?
justice
white
no,
no,
in
hobbs?
justice
white
what
were
the
questions
presented
here?
justice
white
including
the--
justice
white
--retaliatory?
justice
white
there
was
a
retaliatory
tax
there?
justice
white
are
you
sure
there
weren't
discriminations
among
foreign
companies?
justice
white
no,
that
isn't
what
you
said
just
now.
i'll
put
it
to
you
another
way.
would
all
foreign
insurance
companies
doing
business
in
kansas
pay
the
same
tax
under
that
law?
justice
white
well,
then,
there
is
discrimination
in
the
case.
justice
white
but
there's
evidence
that
they
paid
more
than
some
other
companies
paid.
justice
white
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
said
that
was
quite
legal
to
do.
justice
white
you
were
going
to
get
to
that,
so
go
ahead.
justice
white
--and,
therefore?
justice
white
no;
and
therefore
there
wasn't
any
equal
protection
violation
here
on
this
statute,
either.
justice
white
--are
you
arguing
now
equal
protection
or
commerce
or
both?
justice
white
well,
how
many
states
have
taxes
similar
to
yours?
justice
white
do
you
think
if
you
lose
this
case,
all
of
those
laws
will--
justice
white
it
would
be
satisfactory
if
ohio
only
reduced
the
tax
on
california
companies?
justice
white
--i
take
it
that
your
argument
on
the
equal
protection
clause
is
wholly
aside
from
the
mccarran
act.
if
the
mccarran
act
had
never
been
passed,
your
case
would
be...
in
here
would
be
exactly
the
same.
justice
white
well,
but
that's...
it
barely
mentioned
equal
protection.
justice
white
i
know.
i'm
saying,
barely.
barely.
justice
white
but
it
wasn't
one
of
the
questions
even
raised
and
presented
in
the
state
courts
or
here.
justice
white
yes,
i
know.
justice
white
nor
the
mccarran
act.
justice
white
but
the
tax
depends
on
residence?
is
that
it?
citizenship?
justice
white
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
the
principal
office
is?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
arise,
if
you're
talking
about
equal
protection,
if
you're
talking
about
rationality
to
have
your
tax
determined
on
just
where
you
happen
to
be
incorporated.
i'm
sure
you
insist
that's
a
rational
basis
for
discriminating
between
foreign
corporations.
justice
white
that's
the...
i
suppose
you
say
that
is
the
determining
factor
in
all
these
49
laws?
