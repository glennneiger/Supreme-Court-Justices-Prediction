mr.
kevin
colleran
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
court
appointed
counsel
for
the
respondent
in
this
case,
bert
taylor,
jr.
the
respondent
cannot
concur
with
the
statement
of
facts
as
given
this
morning
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
i
am
somewhat
shocked
to
find
at
this
late
date
that
the
attorney
general's
office
is
now
taking
the
position
that
the
conduct
involved
was
not
in
violation
of
the
regulations
of
the
institution.
i
think
that
they
concede
as
much
in
their
brief.
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think,
can
be--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--the
facts,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
colleran
if
they
weren't
in
violation?
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
think,
first
of
all,
there
is
some
evidence
of
intent.
but
aside
from
that,
i
think
that,
i
think
the
key
is,
your
honor,
is
that
they
acted...
there
was
an
established
institutional
procedure
which
they
violated,
and
i
suspect
that
if
there
had
been
no
institutional
procedures
and
if
they
had
simply
left
mr.
taylor's
property
to
the
wind
or
whoever
grabbed
it
when
it
came
to
the
institution,
that
there
would
be
no
difference.
but
i'm
just
saying
that
i
think
the
facts
are
different
than
as
related
by
the
attorney
general's
office
this
morning,
and
they're
considerably
different.
i
think
the
attorney
general's
represented...
well,
as
i
stated,
i
think
that
they
can
be
broken
into
three
different
categories,
the
first
being
the
institutional
procedure
that
was
in
effect
at
all
times
pertinent
hereto,
and
this
was
set
forth
in
the
stipulated
facts
of
the
grievance
supervisor
or
officer
prepared
by
the
attorney
general's
office,
at
his
suggestion,
at
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
default
judgment
in
this
particular
case,
filed
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
for
their
failure
to
answer
interrogatories.
and
the
grievance
procedure
was,
as
stipulated
to,
that
normal
procedure
when
a
package
is
received
at
the
institution
addressed
to
an
inmate,
at
the
central
mail
room,
it
is
either
that
the
package
is
delivered
to
the
inmate's
cell
where
he
signs
the
package
receipt,
or
the
inmate
is
notified
to
pick
the
package
up
at
the
hobby
center
and
to
personally
receipt
for
it.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
deviations
from
this
practice
are
only
made
in
exceptional
circumstances,
and
there
is
no
record
of
there
being
any
exceptional
circumstance
in
this
case,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
an
entirely
different
case
from
that
as
represented
to
the
court
this
morning
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
there
again,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general's
office
has
fabricated
something
out
of
the
record.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
was
in
deadlock
or
anything
else.
he
was
transferred
to
the
adjustment
center.
the
reason
he
was
transferred
there
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
know
for
a
fact
because
i
have
represented
mr.
taylor
since
1973,
in
this
and
another
litigation,
that
mr.
taylor
spent
time
in
the
adjustment
center
at
his
own
choosing
from
time
to
time
because
he
felt
the
need
to
be
in
the
adjustment
center
for
security
reasons.
there
is
nothing,
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
he
was
there
because
of
a
disciplinary
problem
that--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
supervisor's
indicated
that
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
adjustment
center
was
not
an
exceptional
circumstance
and
did
not
justify
the
conduct
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
colleran
all
right.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
there
was.
mr.
kevin
colleran
okay.
well,--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--yes,
i
think
we
can,
judge.
i
think
that...
your
honor...
in
this
particular
case,
particularly,
i
think
that
we
have
a
situation
where
the
property
comes
to
the
institution
after
he
has
paid
for
it
and
ordered
it
in
accordance
with
institutional
procedures.
it
is
taken
into
custody
when
it
comes
to
the
mail
room
to
be
examined,
and
when
he
goes
to
get
the
property
later
on
it's
not
there.
and
the
reason
that
it's
not
there
is
because
the
institutional
procedures
were
violated,
and
the
reason
that
the
institutional
procedures
were
violated
are
set
forth
in
the
answers
to
interrogatories
filed
on
october
12,
1976,
by
the
warden
and
by
the
supervisor
of
the
hobby
center.
they
set
forth
an
institutional
procedure
that
is
totally
foreign
to
what
actually
should
have
been
going
on
out
there.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes.
mr.
kevin
colleran
all
right.
well,
i
didn't
understand
the
attorney
general's
office
to
be
that.
i
thought
he
was
saying
in
effect
that
they
were
in
conformance
with
institutional
procedures
and
therefore
were
not
negligent.
but
assuming,
if
we
can
assume,
at
least,
some
negligence...
and
i
think
that
the
conduct
on
the
behalf
of
the
petitioners
goes
far
further
than
just
simple
negligence,
if
we
can
categorize
it.
i
think
that
to
suggest
in
this
particular
case
that
mr.
taylor
should
have
proceeded
under
the
state
tort
claims
act
in
nebraska,
frankly
i
find
a
little
bit
shocking.
mr.
taylor
was
represented
by
himself
from
the
time
that
he
first
filed
this
claim
until
april,
mid
april
of--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--on
another
matter,
your
honor.
i
did
not
represent
him
on
this
particular
case
until
i
was
appointed
in
april
of
1977.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
no.
i
was
court
appointed
in
that
case
as
well.
mr.
kevin
colleran
he
had
a
particular
fondness--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--well,
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i'm
saying
that
i
represented
mr.
taylor
on
an
earlier
action,
at
the
institution.
i
was
not
appointed
and
was
totally
unaware
of
this
case
until
april,
1977,
two
years
after
the
taking
of
this
property.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
he
did
not;
not
about
this
matter.
he
never
did.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
do
not
want
to
withdraw
my...
i
was
simply--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i
was
simply
pointing
out,
your
honor,
that
i
represented
him
since
1973
and
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
sent
to
the
adjustment
center
for
reasons
other
than
disciplinary
reasons
in
response
to
any
inquiry
by
justice
stevens.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes,
but
i
was
totally
unaware
of
this,
is
what
i'm
saying.
i
was
not
advised
of
it
until
april,
1977,
when
i
was
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
him
in
this
case.
that's
the
first
time
i
had
knowledge
that
he
has
lost
his
property
out
there.
see,
he
had
been
transferred
to
the
state
of
arizona.
he
was
serving
time
in
other
institutions
other
than
the
state
of
nebraska,
so
i
did
not
have
day
to
day,
week
to
week,
or
even
month
to
month
contact
with
him.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
at
the
time
i
was
appointed,
there's
a
two
year
statute
of
limitations
under
the
nebraska
tort
claims
act.
mr.
kevin
colleran
correct.
that's
an
entirely
different
procedure
than
the
nebraska
tort
claims
act.
there
is
also
a
small
claims
court
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
he
tried
to
pursue
the
small
claims
court,
which
is
the
county
court
and
the
municipal
court
for
the
city
of
lincoln.
i
tried
to
track
down
records,
and
it's
not
a
part
of
this
record,
but
i
tried
to
pursue
this,
and
there
is
no
record
either
in
the
municipal
court
or
the
county
court
over
there,
but
that
that
is
an
entirely
different
proceeding
than
the
state
tort
claims
act
which
provides
that
he
must
first
proceed
under
the
administrative
provisions
of
the
act.
so,
and
to
suggest--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
kevin
colleran
why
he
did
not
pursue
the
tort
claims
act?
mr.
kevin
colleran
well--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--well,
i
think
that
there
are
several
deficiencies
with
the
nebraska
tort
claims
act,
some
of
which
have
been
alluded
to
by
this
court
today.
the
first,
of
course,
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
but
the
attorney
general--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--oh,
i
think
that's
part
of
it.
i
think,
first
of
all,
that
he
did
try
to
pursue
the
grievance
procedures
out
at
the
institution
and
was
denied
those.
and
i
sort
of
assumed
that
he
was...
i
can't
speak
for
him,
but
i
assume
he
was
probably
getting
a
little
frustrated
with
the
system
and
he
thought
he
could
get
relief
in
federal
court.
but
there
is
no
provision
for
attorney's
fees
and
there
is
no
provision
for
the
appointment
of
counsel,
which
means
in
every
instance
for
mr.
taylor
and
those
similarly
situated,
he's
going
to
be
going
it
alone
against
the
considerable
resources
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes,
i
think
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
think...
yes,
i
think
he
has
sued...
well,
he
could
sue
the
officials
in
this
particular
case
as
well.
mr.
kevin
colleran
we
sued
them
both
individually
and
in
their
official
capacity.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
that...
you
mean
under
the
small
claims
court?
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
assume
that
we
could
execute.
in
this
case,
however,
he
was
denied
any
relief
under
the
small
claims
court.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes,
according...
again,
this
is
not
part
of
the
record,
but
in
talking
with
mr.
taylor
by
long
distance
phone,
he
told
me
he
was
summarily
dismissed
out.
he
tried
it
twice,
in
fact,
and
was
summarily--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
kevin
colleran
that
was
stipulated
to
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
and
that,
i
would
like
to
also
indicate,
that
we
did
not
seek
punitive
damages
in
this
case
of
$1,000.
we
abandoned
that
claim.
the
only
thing
we
were
seeking
was
our
compensatory
damages
in
the
amount
of
$23.50.
mr.
kevin
colleran
it
is
in
the
complaint,
but
we've
abandoned
that.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
under
the
civil
rights
act
i'm
entitled
to
an
attorney's
fee.
the
prevailing
party
is
entitled
to
attorney's
fees.
mr.
kevin
colleran
which
we
could
not
get,
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
important
provision
of
this
act,
because,
again,
mr.
taylor
would
have
been
forced
to
proceed
pro
se
under
the
state
tort
claims
act.
mr.
kevin
colleran
if
he'd
been
successful;
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
don't
know
that
the
administrative
procedure
would
have
provided
him
anything
at
all.
it
is
administered
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
theoretically,
the
remedy
is
possible.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
that's
a
considerable
difference,
i
think,
to
my
client.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
kevin
colleran
oh,
i
see.
well,
yes,
i
think
that's
probably
correct.
but,
again,
you
know,
this
court
has
held,
i
think,
since
monroe
v.
pape
that
section
1983
is
supposedly
to
be
an
addition
to
a
state
remedy
that
a
state
might
have
provided.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
on
this
record
that
the
administrative
procedures
act
of
the
tort
claims
act
would
have
been
available,
or
a
successful
remedy
to
him.
it
is
a
theoretical
remedy,
much
the
same
as
was
discussed
in
monroe
and
in
a
line
of
cases
since
that
time.
and
i
think
to
suggest,
if
we
take
mr.
taylor
and
say,
all
right,
for
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
you
have
to
go
under
the
state
tort
claims
act,
we're
putting
everybody
under
the
state
tort
claims
act,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
end
of
section
1983
for
fourteenth
amendment
cases.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
section
1983,
or
the
color
of
state
law
provision,
is
the
misuse
of
power.
and
simply
because
we
have
an
automobile
accident
involving
a
state
employee
does
not
mean
that
there
has
been
misuse
of
power.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
that's
correct,
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
for
section
1983
it
requires
a
misuse
of
state
power.
and
i'm
saying
that
while
he
may
have
been
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right,
it
may
be
only
a
common
law
tort,
as
opposed
to
giving
him
accessibility
to
section
1983.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
it
is
based
upon
the
fact--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--my
claim
is
based...
well,
on
a
yes
or
no
answer,
i
don't
know
that
it's
possible
to--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
my
claim
is
based
upon
a
very
high
degree
of
negligence,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kevin
colleran
it
is--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i
think
that
first
of
all,
with
that
given
set
of
facts...
let
me,
if
i
could,
embellish
the
facts
a
little
bit.
i
think
that--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
colleran
that
is
correct.
mr.
kevin
colleran
misuse.
mr.
kevin
colleran
that's
correct.
there
is
no...
under
these
facts
that
you've
just
given
me,
there's
no
way
that
i
can
say
that
there
has
been
a
misuse
of
state
power.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
as
i
understand
section
1983,
i
think,
as
i
understand
section
1983,
one
of
the
purposes
for
its
creation
was
the
misuse
of
state
power,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
distinguishing
feature
here
in
this
particular
case
is,
we
have
the
warden,
who
is
the
chief
administrative
official
of
the
institution,
and
we
have
the
individual
who
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
protecting
the
respondent's
property
taken
into
custody,
and
they
are
in
effect
violating
an
affirmative
duty
placed
upon
them
by
the
institution
itself,
by
ignoring--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--yes.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
agree.
maybe
i
didn't
understand
the
thrust
of
justice
rehnquist's
question.
mr.
kevin
colleran
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
at
the
application
for
rehearing
in
the
8th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
this,
as
i
started
to
say,
before
was...
that
was
a
year
ago,
this
time,
which
means
that
it
was
three
years
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
on
the
respondent
in
this
claim.
mr.
kevin
colleran
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
is
under
the
nebraska
law
an
affirmative
defense,
but
the
attorney
general's
office
is
charged
with
the
administration
of
processing
the
tort
claims
act,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
year
and
some
six
months
that
they
had
notice
of
this
claim,
mr.
taylor
claiming
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right,
that
they
could
have
either
raised
that
in
their
pleadings
or
have
told
him
in
some
other
communication
that
they
felt
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
court
under
the
wrong
law.
mr.
kevin
colleran
it
certainly
was
not
raised
in
the
pleadings;
it
was
not
raised
at
any
time
in
the
trial
court.
it
was
not
raised
at
any
time
in
their
brief.
it
the
8th
circuit
court
of
appeals
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
their
application
for
rehearing.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
yes;
that's
correct.
i
guess
it's
our
position,
justice
blackmun,
that
at
this
point
in
time,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
state
having
raised
it
for
the
first
time
in
its
application
for
rehearing,
it's
a
little
bit
tardy.
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
on
mr.
taylor
now.
there's
a
two
year
statute
of
limitations
which
expired,
as
i
indicated
before,
prior
to
the
time
that
i
was
appointed
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
that
under
the
state
of
the
law
in
1975,
and
as
i
understand
the
law
even
today,
that
that
would
have...
it
was
his
choice
of
forum.
he
has
an
allegation
of
a
federally
protected
or
constitutional
right
he
thinks
he's
been
deprived
of.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
they
didn't
given
him
ample
notice,
and
to
the
extent
that
he
was
aware
of
the
procedures,
the
grievance
procedures
at
the
institution,
he
did
pursue
those,
and
got
nowhere.
mr.
kevin
colleran
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
true
in
nebraska
as
well,
your
honor,
and
i'm
just
saying
that
in
this
case,
the
only
thing
i
know
about
his
small
claims
application
is
mentioned
in
the
tag
end
of
his
complaint,
and
he
said
that
he
tried
it
and
was
dismissed
summarily
out,
twice.
and
i
attempted
to
run
down
the
records
of
it,
and
they
had
no
trace
of
them,
so
i
really
don't
know
what
went
on
in
small
claims
court.
mr.
kevin
colleran
in
the
small
claims
court?
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
did
not;
it
was
a
pro
se
complaint
filed
some
year
and
a
half
before.
mr.
kevin
colleran
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
colleran
if
i
understand
your
question,
if
the
computer
malfunctions
and
the
taxpayer
is
deprived
of
some
of
his
tax
dollars?
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
and
perhaps
with
the
situation
with
the
racing
state
car,
there
would
be,
i
think
there
would
be
the
entitlement
of
some
qualified
immunities,
and
if
these
qualified
immunities
were--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
i
don't
know.
i
think
that
if
there
had
been...
had
that
been
negligence.
--i
can't--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i
think
that
if
the
individual
established
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
and
it
was--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--that
is
correct.
and
i'm
not
certain
what
the
deprivation
would
be
in
the
particular
hypothetical
that
you
have
just
set
forth.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
here
the
individual
ordered
the
property
and
in
accordance
with
institutional
procedures
relied
upon
those
procedures
and
was
denied
that
property
when
it
got
to
the
institution.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
it
would
be
a
deprivation,
and
assuming
that
there
were
some
procedural
violations
and
there
were
allegations
of
negligence,
then
that
may
well
set
forth
a
section
1983
action.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
think
that
there
is
more
involvement
on
the
warden's
part
than
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that,
as
i
noted
earlier,
he
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
administering
this
procedure.
and
he
was
administering
a
procedure
that
was
worse
than
no
procedure
at
all.
he
testified
under
oath
in
his
answers
to
interrogatories
that
he
felt
the
institutional
procedure
was
that
anyone
who
happened
to
be
around,
in
effect,
to
receipt
for
an
inmate's
property,
could
do
so.
and
it
seems
to
me
this
placed
him
in
a
position
where
he
could
not
supervise
those
under
his
control,
he
could
not
correct
the
incorrect
application
of
the
institutional
procedures,
and
he
could
not
correct
the
incorrect
application
of
the
institutional
procedures,
and
he
could
not
supervise
the
petitioner
lugenbill,
who
is
charged
directly
with
the
control
and
custody
of
the
property.
mr.
kevin
colleran
i
think
that
if
he
made
the
institutional
procedures
available
to
those
charged
with
the
direct
administration
of
this
and
saw
to
it
that
they
got
those
procedures,
and
perhaps
instructed
them
that
they
should
be
read
and
they
should
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
them,
then
there
would
be
a
more
tenuous
connection
with
the
warden
in
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
governor...
i
think
that
in
this
particular
state
the
warden
is
under
a
direct
statutory
duty
to
administer
the
institutional
procedures.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
guess
i
think
it's
more
than
respondeat
superior.
mr.
kevin
colleran
yes.
but
i
think,
again--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--yes;
yes.
i
guess,
in
summing
up,
i
would
say
that...
and
i
recognize
that
this
court
in
rizzo
has
held
that
respondeat
superior
is
not
viable
under
section
1983,
but
again,
i
think
in
this
case
there
is
more
than
that
involved.
i
think
that...
again,
i
think
mr.
taylor
has
been
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
kevin
colleran
the
right
to
his
property.
mr.
kevin
colleran
no,
i
think
that
he
was
deprived
of
it
without
due
process
of
law
as
well.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
suspect
that
that
burden
then
properly
belongs
upon
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
think
that,
in
a
reading
of
section
1983
and
the
cases
they
have--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--correct.
i'm
sorry.
i
meant
in
reading
monroe
and
the
cases
that
have
followed,
i
don't
think
that
there's
been
any
intimation
that
the
state
tort
claims
act
was
a
substitute
for--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--absolutely.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
kevin
colleran
it's
a
case
of
conversion,
boiled
down
to
its
simplest.
they
took
property
that
belonged
to
him
into
their
custody--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--well,
i
think,
in
this
particular
case
it's
the
taking
without
due
process.
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
think
then,
that
if
the
inmate...
you
mean,
had
simply
gone
in
his
cell
or
something
and
taken
it?
mr.
kevin
colleran
well,
i
don't
know,
then,
that
the...
i
don't
know
that
the
state
in
that
instance
would
be
responsible,
or
the
warden,
or
the
supervisor,
just
given
those
set
of--
mr.
kevin
colleran
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
an
important
difference
in
simply
property
disappearing
out
of
a
cell
and
in
a
place
where
an
individual
orders
property
through
the
united
states
mails
in
reliance
upon
an
institutional
procedure,
that
he
will
be
able
to
take
that
property
into
custody
when
it
gets
there.
and
he
orders
that
property
and
pays
for
it
and
relies
upon
it,
and
then
finds
when
he
gets
out,
the
property
has
disappeared...
because
institutional
procedures
haven't
been
followed.
as
again,
i
stated
earlier,
this
was
worse
than
no
procedure
at
all
because
mr.
taylor
was
left
in
the
position
where
he
thought
there
was
an
institutional
procedure
to
protect
his
property.
he
finds
out
that
not
only
is
the
institutional
procedure
not
being
followed
but
there
is
one
that
has
been
placed
into
effect,
apparently
by
the
warden,
in
the
custody
of
the
hobby
center,
that
is
worse
than
no
policy
at
all.
