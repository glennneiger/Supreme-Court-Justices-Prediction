justice
jr.
general
brown,
does
nebraska
still
have
the
common
law
of
torts
practised
in
your
courts?
justice
jr.
would
a
common
law
tort
action
and
a
lien
against
the
individuals
alleged
to
have
been
responsible
for
this
loss,
rather
than
against
the
state?
justice
jr.
suppose
one
of
the
prison
guards,
for
example,
had
an
automobile
accident
resulting
from
his
negligence
when
he
was
taking
a
prisoner
to
and
from
a
court
for
hearing.
could
the
prisoner
sue
the
guard
in
nebraska
under
the
common
law
tort
doctrine?
justice
jr.
why
not?
justice
jr.
could
you
bring
a
damage
suit
if
you
were
riding
in
my
automobile
and
by
gross
negligence
i
caused
an
accident?
we
can
in
virginia.
can't
you
do
that
in
nebraska?
justice
jr.
well,
what
would
the
difference
be,
if
a
prisoner
is
riding
in
a
prison
vehicle
to
the
court
and
the
driver
by
gross
negligence
has
an
accident
that
results
in
injury
to
the
prisoner?
couldn't
he
bring
a
tort
action
under
state
law?
justice
jr.
against
the
driver?
what's
the
difference
between
you
and
the
prisoner,
in
those
circumstances?
justice
jr.
mr.
brown,
if
a
prison
guard
stole
an
article
of
personal
property
from
an
inmate,
what
remedy
would
he
have?
justice
jr.
yes.
the
guard
had
stolen
an
item
of
personal
property
from
the
inmate's...
cell.
let's
say
he
took,
if
you
allow
transistor
radios,
that
he
took
his
radio
or
took
three
books
or
whatever,
stole
them.
justice
jr.
right.
justice
jr.
mr.
colleran,
may
i
put
this
hypothetical
to
you?
let's
assume
that
a
state
tax
department
through
negligence
in
the
operation
of
its
computer,
for
example,
failed
to
make
a
refund
that
was
due
a
taxpayer,
say,
for
two
or
three
years.
finally
it
came
to
the
taxpayer's
attention.
would
that
case
be
analogous
to
this
one,
so
it
could
be
a
constitutional
violation
to
justify
a
1983
lawsuit?
justice
jr.
he
doesn't
get
his
money
for
two
or
three
years,
whatever
the
time.
he
doesn't
get
it
when
it
is
due.
let's
assume,
to
make
the
case
perhaps
easier
for
you,
that
negligence
is
alleged.
and
if
the
people
who
operate
the
computer
had
known
exactly
how
to
manage
it
the
way
it
should
have
been
managed,
that
error
would
not
have
been
made.
justice
jr.
but
before
you
come
to
immunity,
you
have
to
have
liability.
would
there
have
been
liability
under
1983?
a
suit
against
the
individual
personally
and
officially?
justice
jr.
would
it
be
any
easier
for
you
if
you
eliminated
the
computer
and
some
clerk
had
simply
made
a
mathematical
error,
an
a
stupid
mathematical
error,
negligently,
that
resulted
in
the
delay
in
the
payment
of
a
just
refund?
justice
jr.
well,
you're
assuming
the
answer
when
you
say
that.
justice
jr.
you
think
that's
immediately
and
clearly
different
from
your
case?
justice
jr.
if
you're
entitled
to
money,
that's
not
a
deprivation
of
property
if
it's
withheld
from
you?
