justice
blackmun
you
say
as
a
part
of
their
clerical
duties.
doesn't
your
opposition
claim
that
that
was
against
prison
regulations?
justice
blackmun
do
you
agree?
justice
blackmun
where
in
this
litigation
was
the
talk
of
the
existence
of
a
state
tort
claims
act
raised?
justice
blackmun
this
lawsuit
really
hasn't
been
tried,
has
it?
it
went
off
in
summary
judgment?
justice
blackmun
is
the
existence
of
the
state
tort
claims
act
an
affirmative
defense
on
the
part
of
the
defendants?
justice
blackmun
well,
it
certainly
was
not
raised
in
the
pleadings.
justice
blackmun
i'm
merely
asking
whether
we
aren't
spinning
our
wheels
with
all
this
talk
about
the
state
tort
claims
act
in
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
is
before
us?
i
should
direct
this
to
your
opponent,
not
to
you.
justice
blackmun
are
you
indicating
there
are
a
lot
of
losses?
certainly,
you
wouldn't
reevaluate
because
of
a
$23
loss,
would
you?
