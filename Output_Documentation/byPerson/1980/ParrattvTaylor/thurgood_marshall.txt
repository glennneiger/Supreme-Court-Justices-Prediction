justice
marshall
but
here
he
seeks
also
$1,000
damages
and
also
$1,000
punitive
damages.
justice
marshall
which
he
couldn't
get
in
the
claims
court.
justice
marshall
do
you
deny
that
somebody
deprived
somebody
of
$23
and
you
would
fine
him
$2,000
for
it?
it's
no
problem?
justice
marshall
i
thought
you
said
you'd
represented
him
since
19-seventy-something?
justice
marshall
he
had
retained
you?
justice
marshall
but
you
said
you
kept
talking
to
him.
justice
marshall
about
anytime
he
would
go
to
this
separate
place.
justice
marshall
what
do
you
mean...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
absolutely
that
he
didn't
have
counsel?
justice
marshall
but
knew
how
to
get
in
touch
with
you,
didn't
he?
justice
marshall
well,
then
you
want
to
withdraw
your
statement
that
you
represented
him
since
1970-something?
justice
marshall
i'm
disappointed.
justice
marshall
during
the
same
time
that
this
incident
occurred?
justice
marshall
but
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
attorney's
fee
was
$792.54.
justice
marshall
it
is
in
the
complaint.
justice
marshall
but
you
didn't
abandon
$792?
justice
marshall
which
you
couldn't
get
under
the
other
one.
justice
marshall
well,
he
only
got
the
$25
back.
that's
all
he
got
was
$25,
right?
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean,
his
judgment,
that's
all
he
got?
he
got
the
same
thing
he
would
have
gotten
through
the
administrative
machinery.
didn't
he?
justice
marshall
well,
what
else
did
he
get?
justice
marshall
well,
it
could
have
given
it.
justice
marshall
well,
haven't
some
people
won
when...
you
didn't--
justice
marshall
--the
only
difference
between
what
he
could
have
gotten
under
the
administrative
machinery
and
what
he
did
get
here
was
zero.
is
that
correct?
justice
marshall
zero?
he
didn't
get
anything
more.
justice
marshall
well,
the
answer
is
that
the
only
additional
money
obtained
in
this
action
as
to...
contrasted
to
what
he
could
have
gotten
in
the
other
action
was
counsel's
fees.
that's
my
question.
justice
marshall
well,
now,
which
is
it?
is
it
conversion?
is
it
taking
without
due
process?
what
is
it?
justice
marshall
that's
all
you
allege.
what
if
an
inmate
had
taken
it
rather
than
it
disappearing
the
way
it
did?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
would
i
be
correct
in
assuming
that
you've
already
done
something
to
correct
somebody
from
stealing
people's
property?
justice
marshall
well,
my
final
question
is,
why
didn't
you
tell
this
man
that
he
could
get
his
remedy
by
the
claims
act?
