justice
white
how
would
your
argument
change
if
the
inmate
said,
you've
lost
my
property,
and
the
answer
is,
yes,
we
have.
we
did
it
negligently,
but
we
lost
it.
and
he
says,
well,
aren't
you
going
to
either
replace
it
or
pay
me
for
it?
and
they
say,
no,
absolutely
not.
do
i
have
any
remedy?
not
that
we
know
of.
justice
white
yes,
it's
no
longer
just
a
piece
of
negligence,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
suppose
texas
law
just
hasn't
got
any,
there
isn't
any...
or
nebraska
law,
there
just
isn't
any
remedy,
internal
remedy
under
the
state
law.
the
prison
officials
are
perfectly
correct.
we
just...
there
just
isn't
any
remedy
as
far
as
we
know
of.
and
we're
not
going
to
pay
you,
and
we're
not
going
to
replace
the
property.
but
that's
no
longer
negligence.
that's
a
willful
deprivation
of
his
property,
isn't
it?
exactly.
they
either
are
going
to
give
him
a
remedy
or
it's
going
to
be
that,
isn't
it?
yes.
justice
white
at
least
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
argument
here
if
that
had
happened.
you
wouldn't
be
making...
what
would
you
think
about
a
1983
action
on
those
very
facts
which
you
just?
justice
white
but
why?
it
isn't
negligence
any
longer.
they
just
say,
we're
not
going
to
pay
you,
we've
lost
your
property
but
we're
not
going
to
replace
it
or
we
aren't
going
to
pay
you.
as
far
as
we
know
you
haven't
got
any
remedy.
even
though
we
concede
that
we
wrongfully
deprived
you
of
it.
that
is,
deprived
you
of
it
through
our
negligence.
justice
white
i'm
just
suggesting
it
is
no
longer
just
a
negligence
question.
justice
white
then
it
wouldn't
do
you
any
good
to
move
on
to
your
second
argument.
justice
white
--what
constitutional
deprivation
is
alleged
in
this
case?
justice
white
contrary
to
the
obligation
of
the
state
not
to
take
his
property
without
compensating
him,
is
that
it?
justice
white
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
you
understand
it?
justice
white
but
your
answer
to
his
claim
consistently
has
been
and
it
still
is
here
that
there
is
no
denial
of
due
process
as
long
as
the
state
has
a
suitable
procedure
to
compensate
him.
justice
white
so
you're
really
saying
that
as
long
as
we
compensate
him
or
replace
it,
there's
been
no
denial
of
due
process.
justice
white
he
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
sue
the
state
either,
would
he?
just
sue
the
official?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
you
could
collect
from
them?
did
you
sue
them
in
their
official
capacity?
justice
white
so
there
isn't
any...
suppose
this
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
you
get
a
judgment
against
the
officials,
can
you
collect
it
from
them
individually?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
understand
that.
was
he
in
fact
denied
relief
in
the
small
claims
court?
justice
white
it's
all
in
the
record?
justice
white
suppose
there
had
been
ample
notice
to
him
from
the
very
outset
about
the
tort
claims
procedure,
and
he
just
ignored
it?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
not
that
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
controlling.
it's
a
question
of
whether
there
can
be
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
for
depriving
somebody
of
property
if
you
stand
ready
to
pay
him
for
it.
and
if
there
is
that
procedure
in
place
and
if
he
knew
about
it,
if
they
had
given
him
ample
notice
of
it
and
he
just
ignored
it?
justice
white
you
didn't
file
his
complaint?
justice
white
no,
here?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
given
an
adequate
opportunity
to
consider
your
suggestion
that
there
was
a
procedure
available
to
have
this
property
paid
for?
justice
white
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
man
was
aware
of
the
possibilities
of
this
procedure
within
the
time
limits
that
the
procedure
requires?
justice
white
that
was
only
when
the
complaint
was
filed?
justice
white
does
the
record
show
what
the
conversation
was
when
he
found
out
his
property
was
lost?
did
he
ever
ask
people
to
replace
it
or
to
pay
for
it?
justice
white
otherwise,
the
state
just
shrugged
its
shoulders?
for
prison
people?
they
didn't
purport
to
suggest
that
they
would
pay
for
it
or
replace
it?
justice
white
yes;
all
right.
thank
you.
