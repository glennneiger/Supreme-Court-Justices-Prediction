justice
stevens
mr.
brown,
i'm
not
clear
on
your
position
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
process
in
nebraska.
justice
stevens
first
you
imply
that
they
failed
to
make
a
claim
under
the
nebraska
claims
act
and
then
you
said
the
burden
is
on
them
to
demonstrate
the
absence
of
the
claims
act,
i
guess.
well,
what
is
your
position
on
this,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
state
remedy?
justice
stevens
well,
is
it...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
guess,
you
should
be
the
expert
on
what
nebraska
law
is,
here.
is
there
a
state
procedure
by
which
he
could
recover
the
monetary
equivalent
of
the
value
of
his
hobby?
justice
stevens
i
take
it,
mr.
brown,
there
are
no
provisions
for
fees
under
the
state
claimant
procedure?
that's
the
difference?
justice
stevens
but
may
i
ask
about
the
adequate...
you're
saying
that's
an
adequate
procedure,
basically?
two
or
three
years
ago
we
had
a
case
involving
the
procedure
that
must
be
followed
in
shutting
off
electricity,
when
the
billing
procedure
is
bad,
by
a
utility.
and
the
court
held,
in
effect,
you
had
to
advise
the
person
of
his
rights
in
order
to
have
the
process
adequate.
is
there
any
procedure
for
advising
the
inmates
as
to
the
existence
of
this
procedure?
justice
stevens
well,
why
is
it
a
closer
case
under
your
first
argument?
i
don't
think
it
is.
you'd
still
say,
there
is
this
remedy
in
the
claim
procedure--
justice
stevens
--but
your
second
argument
seems
to
me
to
blend
two
different
thoughts.
you
on
the
one
hand
seem
to
be
arguing,
well,
they
really
don't
have
any
proof
of
negligence.
and
alternatively
you
seem
to
be
arguing,
even
if
there
were
negligence,
that
1983
would
not
provide
a
remedy.
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
you're
arguing
both;
i
think
you
are.
justice
stevens
it's
an
exceptional
circumstance
because
he
was
in
isolation.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
matter
why,
but
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
adjustment
center
would
be
an
unusual
circumstance
and
probably
explains
why
he
wasn't
available
to
sign
for
the
package.
justice
stevens
before
you
get
to
the
time
you
were
appointed,
if
i
may,
because
we
got
diverted
a
little
bit
in
the
response
to
my
question
about
the
nebraska
claims
forum,
you
said
he
was
not
represented,
and
it's
kind
of
fanciful
to
assume
that
he'd
know
about
the
procedure.
your
opponent
has
called
our
attention
to
exhibit
b,
which
is
dated
january
8,
1976,
in
which
he
specifically
makes
reference
to
information
he
needs
for
filing
the
small
claims
form.
justice
stevens
why
didn't
he
do
that?
is
it
that
he...
are
you
suggesting
that
the
inmates
don't
know
that
there
is
such
a
remedy?
justice
stevens
why
did
he
not
do
that?
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
that?
justice
stevens
yes.
it
seems
to
me,
if
he
can
get
$32
back
by
filing
an
administrative
proceeding,
surely
that's
better
and
more
desirable
than
coming
all
the
way
up
here?
justice
stevens
well,
but
do
you
need
a
trial
by
jury
in
this
matter?
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
about
this
specific
case.
what
is
there
to
explain
to
us,
if
there
in
fact
is
the
remedy
that
your
opponent
has
represented
exists,
how
is
it
that
he
wouldn't
pursue
it?
is
it
just
the
fact
that
there
are
no
fees
available
for
counsel?
justice
stevens
in
fourteenth
amendment
negligently
caused
property
damage
cases.
because
the
converse
of
that
is,
i
suppose,
is
every
automobile
accident
involving
a
state
employee
is
a
1983
claim
where
you're
guaranteed
attorney's
fees?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
well,
there's
been...
but
you
stick
rather
closely
to
the
language
of
the
constitution.
there's
been
a
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
causing
an
injury
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
constitutional
right?
justice
stevens
is
it
just
the
right
to
his
property,
period?
justice
stevens
then,
you
have
to
allege
the
absence
of
due
process.
justice
blackmun
suggests
there
was
an
affirmative
defense.
i
wonder
if,
isn't
perhaps
the
issue,
who
has
the
burden
of
telling
us
whether
or
not
there
is
an
adequate
state
remedy?
justice
stevens
well,
why,
if
the
constitutional
violation
is
not
just
the
deprivation
of
property,
but
the
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
perhaps
one
could
argue
that
you
have
the
burden
of
demonstrating
an
absence
of
available
process?
justice
stevens
we're
talking
about
the
constitutional
violation
now.
