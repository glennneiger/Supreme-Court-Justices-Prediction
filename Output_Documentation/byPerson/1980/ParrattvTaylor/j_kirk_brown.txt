mr.
j.
kirk
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
my
argument
today
i
will
address
the
petitioners,
mr.
robert
parratt
and
mr.
francis
lugenbill,
as
the
defendants.
i
will
refer
to
mr.
taylor
as
the
plaintiff.
these
are
the
positions
they
originally
occupied
in
this
action.
as
a
bit
of
factual
background,
in
april,
1975,
the
plaintiff
was
housed
in
a
penal
institution
in
the
state
of
nebraska
of
which
mr.
parratt
was
the
warden
and
mr.
lugenbill
was
the
supervisor
of
the
hobby
counter,
which
is
an
internal
organism
which
provides
hobby
goods
for
inmates
at
that
institution.
the
plaintiff
ordered
hobby
material
while
he
was
a
prisoner;
money
was
deducted
from
his
inmate
account
to
pay
the
vendor
for
those
goods.
before
the
goods
arrived
the
plaintiff
violated
the
disciplinary
rule
and
was
placed
in
disciplinary
segregation.
when
the
hobby
materials
arrived
the
plaintiff
was
still
on
disciplinary
segregation
and
was
not
entitled
to
have
them
at
that
point
in
time.
the
materials
were
signed
into
the
institution
by
a
mr.
kosta
and
a
mr.
gero,
as
a
part
of
their
clerical
duties
at
the
hobby
counter,
and
the
material
was
held
at
the
hobby
counter
for
the
plaintiff.
in
june,
1975--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--they
do.
and
i--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--do
i
agree
that
it
was
against
prison
regulations?
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
filed
by
defendant
parratt
and
defendant
lugenbill,
they
indicate
that
those
signatures
were
affixed
as
part
of
their
clerical
duties.
i
admit
that
this
poses
some
problems
at
this
point
in
time,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
case
was
resolved
against
us
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
but,
in
our
opinion,
there
does
appear
to
be
some
question
with
regard
to
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case.
in
june,
1975,
the
plaintiff
was
released
from
disciplinary
segregation
and
requested
that
the
hobby
materials
be
provided
him.
a
search
was
made
for
them
and
they
could
not
be
found.
in
october
of
1975
the
plaintiff
filed
his
first
complaint
with
the
u.s.
district
court
and
the
district
court
did
not
file
the
complaint
and
instructed
him
to
return
and
seek
a
remedy
with
the
department
of
correctional
services.
in
november
of
'75
the
plaintiff
filed
a
second
complaint.
this
complaint
was
filed
but
dismissed
prior
to
issuance
of
summons
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
frivolous.
in
march,
1976,
a
third
complaint
was
filed
and
summons
was
issued.
in
april,
1977,
counsel
was
appointed.
in
june,
1978,
the
plaintiff
filed
his
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
in
october
of
'78
a
judgment
was
granted
the
plaintiff
against
these
defendants.
the
plaintiff
during
this
entire
course
of
conduct
never
filed
a
claim
under
the
nebraska
tort
claims
act
for
return
of
the
value
of
these
materials,
which,
it
is
unquestioned,
were
lost
at
the
institution.
i
would
like
to
address
two
questions
which
are
raised
by
our
brief
today
in
oral
argument.
first
of
all,
whether
the
existence
of
a
state
created
remedy
for
property
loss
caused
by
the
negligence
of
state
employees
provides
adequate
legal
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
second,
i
would
like
to
discuss
whether
simple
negligence
in
the
context
of
a
property
loss
case
can
create
personal
liability
under
section
1983.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
monroe
v.
pape
set
out
three
basic
purposes
for
the
enactment
of
section
1983.
number
one
was
to
override
unconstitutional
state
laws.
number
two
was
to
provide
a
remedy
where
state
laws
were
inadequate.
number
three
was
to
provide
a
remedy
where
an
adequate
state
law
was
not
in
fact
available
to
a
plaintiff.
none
of
these
goals
are
furthered
by
imposing
liability
on
these
defendants.
there
is
no
state
law
question
presented,
and
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
an
adequate
state
remedy
is
not
in
fact
available
to
a
plaintiff
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
if
that
were
the
case,
then
i
think
what
you've
got
is
a
problem
of
denying
the
inmate,
if
in
fact
that
was
within
the
power
of
the
people,
denying
him
the
access
to
his
remedy.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
no.
i
think
you
have
to
characterize
the
case
entirely
different.
one
way,
it
would
be
similar
to,
at
that
point,
infringing
on
that
inmate's
right
to
access
to
the
courts.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
but
i
think
the
thing
that
you
would...
i
guess
i
would
urge
that
type
of
situation
be
evaluated
in
the
context
not
so
much
of
imposing
personal
liability
on
these
persons.
if
you
have
a
person
administering
an
institution
and,
not
by
his
personal
participation,
but
certainly
property
is
lost
on
occasion
in
these
institutions.
i
don't
know
that
you
have
a
situation
where
the
inmate
comes
to
him
and
says,
i
want
to
be
paid,
you
lost
my
property.
and
the
warden
says,
in
this
case,
yes,
i
know
we
lost
your
property.
i
know
the
institution
lost
your
property.
i
personally
will
not
pay
you.
and
the
institution
does
not
have
the
authority
to
pay
you.
it
seems
to
me
at
that
point
you
have
a
substantial
grounds
for
some
interpretation
in
a
declaratory
or
injunctive
sense
as
to
whether
or
not
the
inmate
has
been
denied
by
the
absence
of
a
state
remedy
due
process
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
on
those
facts
i
would
move
directly
to
my
second
argument
regarding
the
basis
of
the
negligence.
but
it
does
seem--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--i
guess
i've
lost
the
trail
here
somehow.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
no,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
you
have
to--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--well,
if
you've
got
the
problem
of
what
is
protected...
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
this
in
the
context,
it
seems
to
me,
of
personal
liability,
and
just
what
exactly
the
authority
of
these
defendants
is
with
respect
to
repayment
of
these
types
of
losses.
our
position
basically
is
that
the
constitution,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
does
not
prohibit
property
deprivations.
it
only
requires
that
a
legal
process
be
available
when
deprivations
occurred.
it
is
the
process
and
not
the
property
which
is
constitutionally
protected
and
constitutionally
significant.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
our
position
is--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--our
position
is
that
a
state
remedy
exists
and
that
if
the
plaintiff
is
to
make
out
a
case
that
he
has
been
denied
property
without
due
process
of
law,
he
not
only
needs
to
show
that
he
has
lost
his
property
but
that
by
some
mechanism
he
has
been
denied
due
process
of
law,
that
that
loss
has
occurred
to
him
without
some
type
of
adequate
process,
whatever
process
might
be
found
to
be
due
him
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
the
nebraska
state
tort
claims
act
regularly
considers
and
regularly
pays,
where
deemed
appropriate,
claims
for
property
lost,
property
damage,
this
type
of
thing,
of
the
inmates
of
our
state
institutions.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
the
inmate
initially
files
a
claim
with
the
state
tort
claims
board.
that
claim
is
administratively--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--is
administratively
reviewed.
the
claim
at
that
point
is
either
determined,
the
department
against
whom
it
occurred,
and
then,
if
the
inmate
is
not
satisfied
with
the
result
of
that,
he
may
appeal
that
directly
to
our
district
court.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
the
trial
would
go
de
novo.
there
is
no
record
created
in
front
of
the
board.
this
is
simply
an--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--an
administrative
consideration
of
whether
the--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
no.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
the
administrative
review
is
simply--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--a
jurisdictional
step
to
get
to
the
district
court.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
at
the
administrative
level
i
think
simply
he
would
indicate
the
circumstances
under
which
his
property
was
lost
and
the
department
of
correctional
services
would
have
the
option
in
this
case
of
coming
forward
and
providing
their
side
of
the
story.
quite
frankly,
in
this
case,
i
don't
see
that
the
department
would
have
ever
taken
the
position,
and
very
often
they
do
not,
that
there
was
no
reason
not
to
compensate
this
man
for
his
loss.
the
difficulty
arises
to
a
certain
extent
in
that
our
claims
board
is
the
only
board
funded
in
the
state
of
nebraska
to
pay
this
type
of
claim.
the
department
of
correctional
services
is
not
funded.
these
are
considered
unappropriated
expenses
and
therefore
the
mechanism
of
the
claims
board
is
involved.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
don't
believe
he
does;
no.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
in
district
court
he
would
have
to
prove
that
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
nebraska,
or
one
of
the
employees
of
the
state
of
nebraska.
simple
negligence
would
suffice
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
right.
under
these
facts
i
don't
anticipate
that
there
would
ever
have
been
a
dispute
on
that.
our
dispute
is
with
regard
to
the
proper
forum
to
seek
the
redress
and
not
with
regard
to
mr.
taylor's
entitlement
to
reimbursement.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
actually,
their
authority
there
is
even
broader
than
that.
there
wouldn't
even
have
to
be--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--if
they
felt
that
there
was
some
inequity
involved,
even
less
than
negligence,
they
certainly
would
have
the
authority
to
reimburse
him
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
it
was
claimed
that
he
was
denied
his
property
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
would
answer--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--that's
my
understanding
of
it;
yes.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
i
guess
in
my
evaluation
of
this,
we
aren't
talking
about
an
eminent
domain
case,
because
that
is
where
the
element
of
intent
comes
in.
and
under
these
circumstances,
where
there
is
no
intentional
taking,
there
is
certainly
no
opportunity
to
provide
this
man
a
pre
loss
process,
whatever
would
be
determined
to
be
appropriate
in
that
taking,
as
in
an
eminent
domain
case
where
you
could
go
in
and
establish
the
value
before
the
property
is
taken.
that
opportunity
simply
isn't
presented
unless
you
have
at
least,
i
would
guess,
at
least
a
reckless
or
a
wanton
and
willful...
you
can
argue
in
that
span
whether
or
not
there
is
some
intellectual
functioning--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
that's
our
position;
yes.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
no,
he
could
not
get
that
in
the
claims
court.
i
guess
our
position
would
be,
it
seems
to
us
under
a
1983
analysis,
those
damages
run
as
a
result
of
the
constitutional
violation,
and
we
are
saying
he
never
reached
that
threshold.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
that
is,
from
a
practical
standpoint
that's
one
of
our
serious
concerns.
even
if
as
the
8th
circuit,
what
contact
i
had
with
them,
their
concern
was,
why
simply
didn't
we
settle
this
case?
why
didn't
we
get
it
out
of
their
hair?
our
position
is,
even
if
we
took
the
position...
or
if
we
are
finally
informed
that
this
type
of
thing
does
establish
a
constitutional
violation,
we
are
still
faced
with
the
substantial
burden,
if
one
of
these
cases
is
filed
in
the
district
court,
and
we
immediately
go
in
and
say,
yes,
we
lost
the
property.
we
now
understand
that
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we're
going
to
have
1988
hanging
over
our
head,
and
every
$23
case
is
going
to
cost
us
$200
or
$300
or
$400
if
we
get
there
five
minutes
after
the
filing
hits
the
table.
this,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
not
from
a
legal
standpoint,
it
poses
a
substantial
problem
for
the
state.
and
that
is
one
of
the
underlying
problems
that
we
urge
here.
i
don't
think
it's
a
basis
for
making
the
decision,
but
it
certainly
is
a
practical
problem
that
we
are
faced
with
from
the
position
of
prison
administration.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
basically
it
proceeds
simply
as
any
other
tort,
state
tort
remedy.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
he
certainly
has
the
opportunity
to
proceed
pro
se.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
at
the
present
time
there
were.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
record,
if
you
look
at
exhibit
b
on
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
it
indicates
that
at
least
in
january,
1976,
that
he
was
aware
of
this
state
procedure.
now,
i
do
not
know
and
the
record
does
not
indicate
how
he
came
to
be
aware,
but
the
second
exhibit
to
his
complaint
is,
i
need
the
numbers
on
my
checks
so
i
can
file
my
state
claim.
apparently
he
was
aware
of
it.
now,
why
at
that
point
having
been
provided
that
information
he
did
not
go
forward
and
file
the
claim,
that's
an
answer
i
don't
have.
but...
and
i
do
know
from
my
personal
contact
with
the
system
in
the
last
two
years
when
i've
worked
with
it,
that
they
are
regularly
informed,
that
if
they
have
a
problem
like
this,
this
is
the
manner
in
which
they
can
seek
redress,
is
to
proceed
through
that
type
of
mechanism.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
believe
they
do;
yes.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
guess
that
would
be
another
portion
of
our
argument.
on
these
particular
facts
i
have
some
serious
questions
as
to
whether
liability
could
have
been
established
under
a
basic
tort
theory.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
guess--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--i
don't
have
the
specific--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--i
would
assume
so.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
guess
in
the--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--the
difference,
i
suspect,
basically,
between
the
driver,
between
a
correctional
officer
operating
that
vehicle,
is
more
practical
than
legal,
though
i
am
not
certain
whether
i
can
answer
your
question
or
not,
because
i
have
some
concern
as
to
whether
or
not
the
tort
claim
procedure
might
forestall
that
type
of
action
against
someone
functioning
as
a
state
employee.
i'm
simply
not
certain
on
that.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
simply
don't
have
an
answer
but
i
certainly...
i
guess
from
the
state
defense
standpoint,
that
would
be
an
issue
i
would
certainly
want
to
look
into
before
i
could
give
you
a
definite
answer
on
that.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
there
may
be
an
election
also.
i
simply--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--certainly.
certainly.
he's
not
forestalled
from
any
remedy
whatsoever.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
right.
moving
on
to
the
negligence
question,
we
think
it
must
be
viewed
in
the
narrow
context
of
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
section
1983
prohibits
the
unintentional
deprivation
of
property
by
persons
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
and
whether
such
acts
would
create
personal
liability?
we
do
not
believe
that
the
language
of
section
1983,
cases
of
this
court
interpreting
section
1983,
or
the
logic,
purpose
and
public
policy
of
that
act,
support
liability
in
this
instance.
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
defendants
directly
caused
or
personally
participated
in
the
loss
of
this
property
rizzo
v.
goode
rejected
liability
without
an
affirmative
participation
by
the
defendants
even
in
an
equitable
action.
and
i
think
we
have
to
realize
that
the
burden
of
proof,
what
needs
to
be
proved
to
obtain
equitable
or
injunctive
release,
or
declaratory
relief,
under
this
act,
is
not
as
stringent
as
should
be
or
what
has
been
imposed
to
obtain
personal
liability.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
yes,
chief
executive
officer;
technically
the
warden
of
that
particular
institution.
justice
blackmun
in
baker
v.
mccollan
said
that
that
reckless
failure
to
stop
a
pattern
of
clearly
unconstitutional
conduct
by
subordinates
could
be
enjoined
under
section
1983,
but
in
that
case
there
was
no
evidence
that
defendants
knew
that
there
was
a
problem
and
that
liability
was
then
rejected.
we
think
we
have
a
similar
situation
here.
there's
no
indication
on
this
record
that
there
was
a
general
failure
with
the
system,
and
there's
no
question
as
to
whether
these
men
particularly
participated
in
it.
so
i
think
we've
got
a
problem
there.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
what
remedy
would
the
inmate
have?
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
i
think,
first
of
all,
what
you
have
is
an
entirely
different
case
than
you
have
here.
what
you're
dealing
with
is
an
intentional
act--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--and
it's
not
our
position
that
that
type
of
act
implicates
the
same
problems
we
see
with
negligence.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
would
think
it
would
be,
not
to
mention...
this
wouldn't
aid...
would
not
necessarily
aid
the
inmate,
but
certainly
we
would,
i
think
that
would
fall
under
our
criminal
laws
as
well.
but
we're
not
talking
about
intentional
theft,
we
aren't
talking
even
about
a
situation
where...
what
now?
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i'm
basically
saying
that
it
presents
a
much
closer
case
because
we're
dealing
with
an
intentional
act.
i
guess
i'm
not--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--certainly.
that's
correct
under
the
first
argument,
but
i
guess
our
position
is
that
our
second
argument
could
form
an
independent
basis,
even
in
the
absence...
certainly
not
all
states
have
established
the
types
of
procedures
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
okay,
under
these
facts,
i
think
i'm
placed
in
a
rather
awkward
position.
our
position,
basically,
is
that
even
if
there
was
proof
of
negligence,
that
it
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
section
1983.
what
we
argued
in
our
brief
is
that
we
don't
even
believe,
on
this
record,
there
is
evidence
of
negligence.
but
i
think
those
are
two
distinct
questions
too.
if
the
court
would
permit
me--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--for
those
purposes,
yes.
i'd
like,
if
i
could,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
again,
since
it
came
up
in
mr.
colleran's
argument,
we
do
not
look
to
the
existence
of
the
tort
claims
remedy
as
an
affirmative
defense.
our
view
is
that
the
existence
of
that
remedy
or
some
similar
remedy
in
fact
provides
the
process
due
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
therefore,
if
it
is
absent
in
any
forum...
it's
against
the
plaintiff,
although
he
may
not
need
to
allege
it
specifically
under
gomez
he
certainly
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
as
a
part
of
his
prima
facie
case.
second
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
use
or
abuse
of
state
power,
it
seems
to
me
on
this
record
the
only
use
of
state
power
here
was
the
establishment
of
the
bailment
of
that
property
when
it
came
into
the
institution.
and
the
loss
of
it,
i
don't
think
necessarily
involves
an
abuse
of
process
in
any
respect.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
guess
i
don't
understand.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--i
would
think,
for
liability,
there
does
have
to
be
some
showing
of
an
abuse
of
the
power
of
the
state.
our
position
would
be
that
that
showing
is
necessary
to
impose
liability.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
yes.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
yes.
we're
saying
that
this
is
a
threshold
question,
and
simply
that
negligence,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
context
of
a
property
loss,
negligent
property
loss,
simply
does
not
cross
the
threshold
of
a
constitutional
violation.
therefore
it
becomes
in
essence
then
a
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
would
make
no
distinction.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
think
our
position,
as
we
briefed
it
and
it
is
today
is
that
the
tort
claims
act
provides
that
type
of
remedy.
i
think
this
came
out
here
also.
our
small
claims
remedy
may.
due
process
being
as
flexible
a
concept
as
this
court
has
pointed
it
out
to
be,
i
think
any
one
of
these
remedies
might
be
evaluated
as
providing
the
process
due.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
made
that
argument
because
i
know
that
certain
of
the
district
court
have
employed
that
argument.
i
felt
it
was
obligatory
on
us
to
raise
it.
quite
frankly,
i
don't
have
any
personal
belief
in
the
strength
of
that
argument.
with
regard
to
any
factual
dispute,
i
would
simply
point
out
that
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
56,
the
court
was
obliged
when
granting
summary
judgment
to
review
all
the
pleadings
on
file
and
just
ask
the
court
to
review
them
again.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
with
regard
to
the
question
of
negligence
and
whether
simple
negligence
itself
forms
a
cause
of
action
under
1983,
that
i
think
the
interest
shown
by
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
here,
along
with
petitioners
themselves,
indicates
a
strong
desire
for
some
guidance
from
this
court
on
that
question.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
if
possible
to
provide
us
some
sense
of
where
we
stand
on
that
question.
finally,
i
think
that
if
the
penal
systems
of
this
country
are
to
improve,
and
i
think
we
all
desire
that
they
do,
we'll
need
qualified,
intelligent,
and
reasonable
people
to
run
them.
and
i
think
we
have
to
be
careful
not
to
make
penal
administration
a
legal
jungle
that
just
has
so
much
potential
for
liability
that
actually
no
reasonable
person
would
want
to
work
in
that
area.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
i
would
suspect
this
would
be
one
of
the
potentials.
we
would
have
to
evaluate
administratively
whether
or
not
we
want
to
carry
on
that
type
of
activity,
if
in
fact
our
administrators
are
going
to
be
held
personally
liable
for
the
loss
of
this
type
of
material,
when--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--we
wouldn't
want
to
reevaluate,
but
certainly
it
would
have
to
play
a
part
in
our
thinking
with
regard
to
any
material
we
allow
to
be
introduced
into
the
institution
that
is
not
constitutionally
mandated.
i'm
simply
saying
that
would
have
to
be
weighed
in
our
consideration.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
we
thought
we
had
a
system
at
that
time,
your
honor.
that
system
has
basically
been
continued.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
my
understanding
is
that
he
was
informed.
i
was
not
personally
involved
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
that's
very
reasonable
to
assume.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
mr.
colleran
is
right
in
the
fact
that
that
issue
was
initially
raised
in
our
motion
for
rehearing,
but
i
think,
as
it
relates
to
such
a
basic
issue,
that
they
did
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
it.
certainly
we
don't
have
any
indication
that
they
did.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
well,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
first
of
all...
well,
let
me
answer...
with
the
exception
of
the
exhibit
b,
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
which
may
or
may
not
relate
to
the
state
claims
now...
or
to
the
state
tort
claims,
whether
it
relates
to
our
small
claims,
and
i
don't
know
that
that
is
distinguished,
that's
the
only--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--right.
my
understanding
is
that's
the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
his
awareness
of
the
situation
one
way
or
the
other.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
however,
that
under
section
81a,
227(2)
of
the
nebraska
act,
it
also
provides
for
a
waiver
of
the
statute
of
limitations
under
the
claims
act,
if
in
fact
the
claimant
has
initially
gone
to
an
improper
forum.
now
that
is
couched
in
terms
of
a
state
forum,
but
i
think,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
that
they
might
take
a
lenient
view
of
that,
that
situation,
in
the
case
of
a
proceeding
to--
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
--the
record...
i
will
grant
you,
the
record
in
this
case
is
very
scanty.
the
record
as
i
would
understand
it
indicates
that
he
contacted
a
mr.
rybolt,
who
is
one
of
the
three
parties
whose
sworn
material
is
before
the
court,
who
was
the
grievance
officer,
to
look
into
the
matter,
and
that
searches
were
made
to
see
if
the
material
could
be
found.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
there
simply
is
no
showing
on
this
record
as
to
what
happened,
and
i
question
the
propriety
of
really
informing
you
beyond
that
because,
first
of
all,
i
was
not
personally
involved
in
it.
mr.
j.
kirk
brown
and
i
think
we
ought
to
stick
to
what
is
on
the
record.
but
again,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
the
question
of
where
the
burden
falls
as
to...
inform.
apparently,
from
the
record,
mr.
taylor
was
aware
that
some
remedy
was
available
to
him.
beyond
that,
quite
frankly,
the
record
is
not
very
elaborate.
thank
you.
