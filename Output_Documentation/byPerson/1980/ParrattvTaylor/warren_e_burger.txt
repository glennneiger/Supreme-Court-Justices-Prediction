chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
parratt
and
lugenbill
v.
taylor.
mr.
brown,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
does
nebraska
have
an
action
for
conversion
or
the
equivalent
of
the
old
common
law
conversion?
wouldn't
that
be
a
remedy
against
him?
chief
justice
burger
you
seem
to
be
conceding
that,
in
my
brother
powell's
example,
that
would
be
a
constitutional
deprivation?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
prepared
to
assume
negligence
for
your
1983
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
colleran.
chief
justice
burger
what
difference
would
it
make
for
the
purposes
of
your
case
if
you
point
that
out?
chief
justice
burger
if
it
wasn't
intentional?
chief
justice
burger
if
not
for
him,
at
least
for
a
lot
of
other
people.
chief
justice
burger
is
your
claim
based
on
negligence?
chief
justice
burger
yes,
or
no?
chief
justice
burger
well,
why
not?
chief
justice
burger
why
not?
it's
a
very
simple
question.
chief
justice
burger
well,
high
degree...
it's
negligence?
chief
justice
burger
then
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
a
state
truck
that's
racing
down
the
street
at
70
miles
an
hour?
that's
a
high
degree
of
negligence,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
doesn't
that
bring
it
within
justice
stevens'
question?
chief
justice
burger
well,
where
does
the
negligence
come
in?
the
wrongful
taking
of
his
property.
chief
justice
burger
why
not?
doesn't
the
state
have
an
obligation
to
watch
the
property
of
the
inmates?
wouldn't
that
be
as
valid
a
negligence
theory
as
you've
alleged
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
you
have
about
five
minutes
remaining
to
you,
counsel.
0
[recess.]
mr.
brown,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
burger
your
argument
is
that
an
abuse
by
way
of
negligence
does
not
violate
the
constitution,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
your
position
the
tort
claims
act
is
what
takes
care
of
that?
chief
justice
burger
could
the
state
of
nebraska
in
its
constitution,
from
federal
constitution,
just
abolish
its
hobby
program
totally?
chief
justice
burger
i
see.
okay,
if
you
don't
know.
it's
true
there's
$23.50
involved
here,
but
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
good
many
thousands
of
dollars
have
been
expended
in
professional
time,
printing
costs,
legal
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
