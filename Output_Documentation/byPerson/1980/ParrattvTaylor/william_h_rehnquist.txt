but
there
was
in
effect
an
eminent
domain
case
rather
than
a
denial
of
due
process?
they
are
different.
justice
rehnquist
parratt
was
the
superintendent
of
the
correctional
facility?
justice
rehnquist
can
we
assume
negligence
on
a...
resolved
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
colleran,
what
about
someone
who
is
not
a
prisoner,
but
who
suffers
a
$25
loss
at
the
hands
of
the
state?
could
he
proceed
pro
se
in
the
small
claims
court
in
lincoln
against
the
state
official
for
a
judgment
of
$25?
justice
rehnquist
why
not?
supposing
that--
--why
do
you
equate
misuse
of
state
power
with
under
color
of
state
law?
under
color
of
state
law
simply
means
that
the
person
was
employed
by
the
state
or
acting
for
purposes
of
the
state,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
why
isn't
the
same
principle
applicable
with
respect
to
the
small
claims
court
proceeding
as
in
your
responding
to
justice
white's
question?
he
filed...
he
said
he
needed
something
to
file
in
the
small
claims
court?
there
apparently
was
no
obstacle
to
his
filing
there.
you
said
he
wouldn't
have
had
a
lawyer
there,
but
most
small
claims
courts
operate
with
no
lawyer
on
either
side,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
rehnquist
he
doesn't
automatically
get
a
lawyer
in
the
1983
pro
se
action.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
colleran,
you
say
mr.
parratt
was
liable.
concededly,
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
misdelivery
or
stealing,
or
whatever
it
was,
of
the
packages,
but
because
he
was
warden
and
responsible
for
the
administration
of
the
institution,
i
take
it?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
his
answer
had
been,
to
this
interrogatory,
we
have
a
perfectly
satisfactory
system
in
our
manual.
i
can't
be
there
every
day
seeing
what
comes
in
in
the
mail
delivery.
i
rely
on
other
people
to
do
it.
do
you
think
you
still
could
hold
him
liable
for
money
damages?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
governor
of
nebraska
who
appoints
the
warden?
justice
rehnquist
what
you
mean
is
abuse
of
a
power
amounting
to
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
don't
you?
