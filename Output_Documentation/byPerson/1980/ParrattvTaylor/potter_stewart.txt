justice
stewart
i
see.
and
the
inmate
has
to
bring
an
action
in
court?
justice
stewart
that's
your
administrative
agency.
justice
stewart
and
that
is...
but
that
is
an
appeal
rather
than
a
trial,
de
novo?
justice
stewart
so
it's
not
subject
to
review--
justice
stewart
--first?
and
then,
there's
an
administrative
consideration
first.
and
then
if
the
inmate
loses
he
goes
to
court
as
a
plaintiff?
justice
stewart
and
it's
not
a
reviewing
court?
justice
stewart
it's
a
trial
court.
jury
trial?
justice
stewart
a
necessary
provision
preceding--
justice
stewart
i
suppose
res
ipsa
loquitur
would
not
be
far
away,
would
it?
i
mean,
the
very
fact
it
was
lost,
it
was
sent
to
him,
and
lost?
justice
stewart
and
would
negligence
be
an
issue
in
the
administrative
proceeding
as
well?
justice
stewart
they
could
give
him
the
money
without--
justice
stewart
and
that
would
be
true
whether
the
claim
were
a
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
or
a
taking
of
property
without
compensation.
justice
stewart
well,
then,
as
a
practical
matter,
unless
he
can
get
free
legal
representation,
he's
not
going
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
he's
not
even
going
to
bring
an
administrative
proceeding,
because
the
fee
would
be
more
than
$22.
i
take
it
they
proceed
pro
se
normally
on
a
proceeding
like
that?
justice
stewart
you
think
as
a
matter
of
state
law
it's
possible
that
the
injured
party
might
be
relegated
to
the
administrative
proceeding?
justice
stewart
you
say
he
has
one
remedy
or
the
other,
though?
justice
stewart
but
he
has
some
kind
of
remedy,
you
will
concede
that?
justice
stewart
to
compensate
him
for
his
personal
injuries?
justice
stewart
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
at
least,
we
can
assume
negligence--
justice
stewart
--on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
justice
stewart
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
the
first
two
issues,
that
have
been
the
only
issues
argued
here.
justice
stewart
well,
now
we're
arguing
about
whether
or
not
there
was
or
was
not
negligence
as--
justice
stewart
--quite
properly,
in
response
to
my
brother
rehnquist's
question.
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
attorney
general
in
his
first
two
arguments
that
he
made
orally
here,
the
only
two
that
he
made
orally,
both
assume
negligence.
now,
in
his
brief,
there
also
is
contested
whether,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
or
was
not
negligence.
i
don't
believe
we
took
this
case
to
decide
that.
justice
stewart
well,
what's
that
got
to
do,
really,
with
whether
or
not
there's
a
constitutional
violation?
and
there
couldn't
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case
unless
the
state
or
its
agencies
were
the
defendants--
justice
stewart
--because
the
constitution
prohibits
only
a
state
depriving
somebody
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
or
taking
somebody's
property
without
compensation.
it
doesn't
prohibit
a
private
party
from
doing
so.
justice
stewart
so,
at
least
on
the
basis
of
respondeat
superior,
you
think,
if
you're
correct
in
your
basic
substantive
claims,
that
he's
the
proper
party
and
defendant?
justice
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
at
least
on
that
basis?
justice
stewart
i
know;
you
think
in
this
case,
it
is?
justice
stewart
i
thought
your
claim
was
that
the
very
taking
of
his
property
without
charging
him
with
anything,
without
a
hearing,
without
notice,
was
itself
a
deprivation
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law?
justice
stewart
well,
didn't
monroe
v.
pape
say
that
1983
is
available,
whether
something
is
legitimate
under
state
law
or
illegitimate
under
state
law?
justice
stewart
well,
i
thought
that's
what
that
case
held,
and
i
thought
that's
what
accounted
for
the
multiplicity
of
1983
suits
that
followed
in
its
wake.
so
long
as
the
defendant
is
a
state
officer,
is
what
it
comes
down
to,
and
it's
no
defense
to
show
that
it
was
either
legitimate
or
illegitimate
under
state
law.
justice
stewart
so
there
doesn't
need
to
be
an
abuse
of
state
power.
justice
stewart
what
if
the
property
had
been
worth,
instead
of
$23.50,
$100,000?
justice
stewart
in
your
brief
you
make
a
de
minimis
argument,
and
that
argument
wouldn't
be
available
to
you
if
the
property
were
$100,000.
