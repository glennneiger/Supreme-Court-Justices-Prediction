justice
stevens
but
he
violates
1962(c)
when
he
commits
two
bank
robberies.
justice
stevens
say
he
commits
two
bank
robberies,
one
on
february
1st,
one
on
march
1st.
why
doesn't
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
stevens
under
1962(c),
isn't
that
directly
covered?
justice
stevens
mr.
wall,
why
does
your
distinction
between
victim
and
criminal
enterprise
itself
necessarily
answer
our
problem?
because
is
it
not
conceivable
that
you
might
have
say,
a
neighborhood
numbers
game,
or
a
neighborhood
prostitution
business,
something
like
that.
and
a
larger
criminal
element
comes
in
and
by
racketeering
activities
takes
over
that
more
or
less
local
enterprise.
why
doesn't
the
statute
apply
there
and
there
the
one
taken
over
would
be
the
victim?
justice
stevens
what
takes
care
of
the
takeover
problem
other
than
1962(b)?
isn't
that
just
exactly
what
that's
directed
at?
justice
stevens
well
maybe
it
wasn't
an
extortion,
maybe
it
was
just
a...
using
whatever
these
racketeering
activities
as
defined
in
the
statute
are,
just
to
take
over
an
illegal
enterprise?
and
i
don't
understand
why
your
distinction
between
victim
and
criminal
helps
us
at
all
in
our
analysis,
because
it
seems
to
me
you
can
have
an
illegal
enterprise,
that
would
also
be
a
victim
of
a
takeover
by
a
larger
illegal
enterprise.
justice
stevens
in
your
ejusdem
argument,
or
argument
under
the
definition,
you
assume
as
i
understand
it,
the
first
listed
things
like
partnership,
corporation,
association,
would
necessarily
be
legitimate.
but
is
it
not
possible
that
a
corporation
could
be
organized
and
do
nothing
but
deal
in
stolen
goods
or
stolen
securities
or
something
like
that,
and
be
wholly
illegitimate.
would
you
say
that
even
a
corporate,
a
corporation,
so
organized
and
totally
illegitimate
would
not
be
an
enterprise
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
but
not
if
it's
a
wholly
illegal
business,
you
don't
broadly
construe
it
then?
justice
stevens
even
though
it's
a
victim?
justice
stevens
but
they
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
reversal
was
required,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
harmless
error
or
not,
didn't
they?
