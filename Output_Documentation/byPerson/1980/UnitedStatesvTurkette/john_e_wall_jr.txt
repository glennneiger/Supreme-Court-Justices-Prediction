mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
opportunity
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
its
decision
in
kotteakos,
and
repair
the
damage
done
to
that
decision
and
to
rule
8,
by
such
circuit
court
decisions
as
elliott.
and
i'd
like
to
mention,
in
that
regard,
what
rico
does
not
do
and
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
do.
the
rico
statute
neither
by
its
terms
nor
in
its
legislative
history,
ever
did
purport
to
allow
a
single
prosecution
of
a
defendant
for
all
his
disparate
and
unrelated
and
otherwise
non
joinable
crimes.
also,
in
enacting
rico,
congress
did
not
intend
to
extend
vicarious
liability
beyond
the
limits
of
traditional
conspiracy
law
to
permit
mass
trials.
what
rico
does
do
and
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
i
suggest,
by
congress,
was
to
protect
the
integrity
of
interstate
businesses
by
1962,
thus
1962(a)
prohibits
people
with
dirty
money
from
buying
into
the
businesses.
1962(b)
prevents
the
takeover
of
interstate
businesses
through
criminal
activity
such
as
extortion
and
whatnot.
and
(c)
prevents
the
corruption
or
spoiling
of
legitimate
businesses
when
one
of
its
employees
or
associates
goes
bad.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
what
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
what
rico
was
designed
to
do
was
to
be
used
like
a
scalpel,
rather
than
a
meat
cleaver.
rico
was
an
integrated
statute
in
itself,
part
of
an
integrated
whole,
the
organized
crime
act.
true,
the
organized
crime
act
was
designed
to
eradicate
organized
crime.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
what
i'm
saying
is,--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--no
sir,
not
under,
the
definition,
and
under
the
precise
restricted
purpose
that
congress
had
in
enacting
this
one
section.
and
i
can
perhaps
best
underline
that,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
if
we
think
of
the
enterprise
that
we're
protecting
as
the
victim,
not
the
criminal,
at
the
heart
of
the
split
in
the
circuit
is
the
distinction
between
the
enterprise
as
victim
and
enterprise
as
criminal.
only
the
first
and
eighth
circuits
have
squarely
and
correctly
looked
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
in
the
symmetry
of
the
rico
title
together
within
the
larger
symmetry
of
the
organized
crime
act,
and
made
it
clear
that
congress'
purpose
was
to
treat
the
enterprise
as
a
victim.
and
this
satisfies
the
plain
meaning,
so
called
plain
meaning
rule;
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
to
make
every
element
within
the
statute
have
significance
and
not
be
redundant,
we
consider--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--there
are
other
titles
within
the
organized
crime
act,
and
other
specific
statutes
that
take
care
of
that
particular
problem.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting,
sir,
is
that
that
is
a
simple
extortion
that
could
be
handled
under
another
statute.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
the
reason
that
analogy
is
helpful
is
that
if
we
follow
the
elliott
definition
and
say
that
all
illegal
enterprises
are
included,
then
we
have
no
cohesive
thought
to
apply
the
conspiracy
concept
to.
according
to
elliott,
the
essential
nature
of
the
plan
was
to
associate
for
the
purpose
of
making
money.
and
rather
than
the
wheels
and
the
chains,
we
have
an
amoeba
like
infrastructure
that
controls
the
secret
criminal
network.
until
elliott,
defining
rico
to
include
so
called
illegal
enterprises,
that
is,
to
include
an
individual
who
does
two
separate
crimes
that
come
under
the
definition
of
criminal
racketeering,
or
a
group
of
individuals
who
do
strictly
illegal
activities,...
excuse
me,
i
lost
my
train
of
thought.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor,
i
suggest...
mr.
justice,
if
you
look
at
the
statute--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--yes
sir,
it
does
make
a
distinction
as
the
first
circuit
and
other
courts
in
dissenting
opinions
have
pointed
out.
under
the
rule
of
ejusdem
generis,
that...
in
interpreting
the
statute,
you
apply
that
canon
of
construction.
also,
when
considered
with
the
other
elements
in
the
statute,
to
give
enterprise
independent
meaning
it
would
have
to
only
refer
to
legitimate
business
rather
than
illegitimate.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
say
that
that,
the
rico
statute,
this
section,
was
not
directed
at
that
activity,
and
that
has
been
the
problem
of
many
a--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--they
weren't
because...
because
they
stated
that
with
this
particular
title
they
were
directing
the
protection
to
the
victims
of...
interstate
businesses
that
were
victims
of
organized
criminal
activity.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
he
could
be
a
victim,
yes
sir,
if
he's
involved
in
legitimate--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--it
was
not
designed
to
protect
him,
no.
that's
correct.
the
anderson
court
makes
the
distinction
that
it
has
to
be
a
separate
economic
entity,
it
doesn't
say
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
and
under
the
anderson
definition
the
wrongdoer
might
be
protected.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
in
what
activity,
now?
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
it's
illegal
activity,
there
has
to
be--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--the
loner--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--if
the
loner
in
the
first
instance,
by
robbing
the
drug
store
intends
only
to
rob
the
drugstore,
he's
not
covered.
if
he
intends
by
robbing
the
drugstore
two
separate
times,
to
make
the
drugstore
owner
give
him
a
piece
of
the
business,
then
i
suggest
the
victim
is
the
drugstore
and
he
is
covered
by
rico,
because
he's
done
precisely
what
congress
was
attempting
to
prevent
from
happening
to
the
legitimate
victim
business
by--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--that's
correct.
in
this
instance,
and
i
suggest
that
it
helps
us
clarify
who
we're
trying
to
protect
if
we
realize
that
in
every
instance
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
protect
legitimate
businesses.
so
we
have
to
think
of
the
enterprise
as
the
victim.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
that,
sir,
was
precisely
the
reason
that
liberal
construction
provision
was
submitted,
i
suggest.
904(a).
and
that,
i
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
mean
that
you
liberally
construe
who
are
the
victims.
congress
wanted
to
protect
as
many
forms
of
legitimate
endeavors
as
possible,
so
to
effectuate
the
remedial
purposes
of
904(a)
you
don't
limit
the
rule
of
lenity,
but
you
broadly
construe
the
term
enterprise
when
enterprise
is
the
victim.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
anderson
says
that
they
would.
i
suggest
that
under
anderson
or
the
first
circuit,
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
legislative
history,
it
doesn't
matter
in
the
long
run.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
liberal
construction
provision
of
904(a)
should
be
applied
only
to
the
definition
liberally
construe
who
are
the
victims.
so
that,
when
you
have
the
definition
statute--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--one
part
liberal
to
the
definition
as
to
who
is
an
enterprise,
who
is
a
legal
enterprise,
because
as
somewhere
in
the
legislative
history
was
mentioned,
organized
crime
may
form
all
kinds
of
different
ways
to
get
around
this.
well
that's
precisely
why
the
broad
term
of
enterprise
is
applied,
when
you
are
construing
it
to
protect
the
victim.
when
it
comes
to
the
criminal,
the
actor,
rather
than
the
one
or
the
individual
or
the
enterprise
acted
upon,
the
rule
of
lenity
applies.
and
by
adopting
our
understanding
of
the
statute,
you
are
protecting
the
rule
of
lenity
regarding
the
penal
provisions.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
am,
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
in
this
regard,
that
i'm
applying
the
broad
construction
to
the
remedial
purpose
of
protecting
the
legitimate
enterprise
which
we
define
broadly.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
rule
of
lenity,
when
that's
applied
to
a
wrongdoer,
the
criminal,
the
one
acting
rather
than
the
one
acted
upon,
no.
and
by
the
approach
that
we
take,
you
protect
the
rule
of
lenity,
and
you
avoid
the
due
process
implications
mentioned
in
dunn
v.
the
united
states,
where
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
writing
for
the
majority
of
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
unanimous
court,
this
practice,
that
is
the
rule
of
lenity,
is
not
merely
a
convenient
maxim
of
statutory
construction,
rather,
it
is
rooted
in
fundamental
principles
of
due
process.
related
to
that
argument,
and
particularly
related
to
what
we
consider
probably
the
most
important
case
to
be
considered
in
this
matter,
is
that
dunn's
observation...
or,
rather
dunn,
dunn
has
significance
with
regard
to
the
justice
department's
observation
is,
well,
theoretically,
this
thing
may
be
overbroad,
but
trust
our
discretion
to
apply
it
properly.
i
suggest
to
you
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
one,
the
justice
department,
instead
of
congress,
then
defines
the
crime.
a
bigger
problem,
as
pointed
out
by
dunn
and
relevant
in
this
case
too,
is
it
defines
the
crime
differently
when
it
signs
the
indictments
than
it
does
at
the
legislative
hearings.
in
dunn,
that
precise
point
was
brought
out
by
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
justice
department's
contemporaneous
rather
than
current
interpretation
offers
the
more
plausible
reading
of
the
subcommittee's
intent.
at
the
legislative
hearings
on
rico,
the
attorney
general,
the
chief
of
the
criminal
division,
everybody,
said
that
the
purpose
of
rico...
again,
applying
the
scalpel
as
part
of
an
overall
plan,
is
to
cut
out
the
cancer
of
racketeering
activity
on
legitimate
interstate
businesses.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
whole,
everything
in
the
legislative
history.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--than
getting
the
wrongdoer--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--title
10.
they
specifically
went
after
the
repeat
offender,
and
title
8,
they
specially
went
after
another
aspect
of
organized
crime,
that's
precisely
the
point
i'm
making,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
a
gambling
debt,
i
assume.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
or
usurious,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
it's
to
create
a
criminal...
a...
to
focus
in
on
the
protection
of
the
victim;
that's
precisely
the
purpose
of
1962.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
it
certainly
does.
and
it
said,
this
particular
type
of
activity,
this
depredation
that's
taking
place
on
legitimate
businesses,
is
serious
enough
that
we're
making
this
drastic
criminal
penalties.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
right.
that's
a
fact,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
excuse
me.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
doesn't...
the
acts
themselves
were
criminal
previously,
and
they
are
otherwise
criminal,
however;
when
they
are
committed
in
this
pattern...
two
separate
acts,
to
do
this
act,
attack
the
victim
that
we
want
to
protect,
it's
a--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
1962(c)
applies,
i
suggest,
to
protect
the
victim;
it
prevents
corruption
or
spoiling
of
a
legitimate
business
or
a
front
business,
as
was
suggested
by
one
of
the
questions,
supposing
there's
an
apparently
legitimate
front
truck
line.
who
is
the
victim?
it's
the
truck
line.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
i
say
they
are
not
covered--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--under
this
particular
statute,
rico,
it
was
not
designed,
it's...
it
was
not
designed,
and
doesn't
make
internal
sense,
and
it
destroys
the
traditional
conspiracy
and
joinder
rules
if
it
is
applied
to
that--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--i
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
most
respectfully,
it
destroys
them.
and
it
changes--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--it
is
probably...
well,
i
suggest,
it
may...
it
is,
the
organized
crime
control
act
is
a
very
broad
net.
however,
congress
did
not
set
up
rico
to
get
all
possible
criminal
activity,
and
they
did
not
intend
this
body
of
lawyers
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
in
alvarez,
this
body
of
lawyers
did
not
intend,
when
they
passed
rico,
to
change
the
rules
of
conspiracy,
to
change
kotteakos,
and
to
change
the
rules
of
joinder.
and
if
they
did
intend
to
do
it,
which
they
didn't,
but
if
they
tried
to,
i
suggest
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
this
court
would
have
much
to
say
about
that.
members
of
the
court,
it
has
been
suggested
that
even
if
this
court
does
agree
with
our
view
of
the
scope
of
rico,
that
my
client
should
nevertheless
have
the
first
circuit
reversal,
the
change,
because
there
was
harmless
error.
and
our
argument
is,
of
course,
that
there
was
not
harmless
error,
that
he
was
joined
with
other
defendants
he
should
not
have
been,
and
that
he
was
joined
in
a
number
of
criminal
charges
against
him,
that
without
the
rico
expansion
of
conspiracy
vehicle
he
could
never
have
been
tried
together
for.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
represented
vargas
at
the
trial
court,
your
honor,
but
as
the
first
circuit
points
out,
severances
were
sought
by
this
defendant
as
well
as
vargas,
and
there
were
many
written
and
oral
requests,
every
few
days
in
this
almost
seven
week
trial.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
well,
you
mean,
an
interlocutory
appeal?
no
sir.
it
was
appealed,
the
denial
of
severance,
was
appealed.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
he
did,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
they
do,
except
for
this.
the
first
circuit
reversed
because
once
the
legally
improper
conspiracy
count
is
out,
there
is
no
basis,
no
legal
basis
for
having
joined
all
these
crimes.
and
they
cited
mcelroy
v.
the
united
states--
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
--it
would
get
them
a
new
trial.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
suggest
finally
to
this
court,
that
the
principles
of
severance
enunciated
in
mcelroy
and
the
language
in
kotteakos
which
supports
it,
suggests
that
he
was
damaged
by
going
to
trial
in
all
these
cases.
for
instance,
vargas
was
found
not
guilty
by
the
jury
on
three
of
the
mail
fraud
counts.
another
defendant
was
found
not
guilty
of
bribery
in
the
police
bribing
count.
i'm
suggesting
that
to
have
gone
to
trial
with
all
these
crimes
confounds
the
defendant.
i'm
suggesting
he
may
well
have
had
a
good
defense,
say,
to
one
or
more
of
the
arson
or
bribery
counts,
and
might
have
wanted
to
testify
but
was
not
able
to
because
of
the
drug
charge.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
john
e.
wall,
jr.
except
for
this:
i
suggest
the
intimation
is,
and
the
fact
is,
that
in
these
circumstances
there's
certain
error
that
is
not
harmless
and
never
can
be
with
this
illegal
theory,
never
can
be
harmless.
and
if
i
might
take
a
moment
just
to
remind
all
of
us
that
in
kotteakos,
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
there
was
no
prejudice,
especially
since
guilt
was
manifest
and
to
reverse
the
conviction
would
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
but
this
court,
speaking
in
kotteakos,
said
technical,
my
foot,
they
said,
what
may
be
technical
for
one
is
substantial
for
another.
what
minor
and
unimportant
in
one
setting,
crucial
in
another.
moreover,
lawyers
know
if
others
do
not,
that
what
may
seem
technical
may
embody
a
great
tradition
of
justice
or
a
necessity
for
drawing
lines
somewhere
between
great
areas
of
law,
that
in
other
words,
one
cannot
always
segregate
the
technique
from
the
substance,
or
the
form
from
the
reality.
i'm
suggesting
also,
members
of
this
court,
that
in
your
decision
in
dunn
that
living,
wonderful
principle
of
our
law
was
again
upheld
where
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
tenth
circuit
said,
it's
obvious
there
was
a
variant,
sure,
but
the
guy
lied
under
oath,
even
if
it
was
in
the
lawyer's
office,
so
let
the
conviction
stand.
oh
no,
this
court,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
written
by
chief
justice...
or
rather,
i'm
sorry,
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
stated:
the
jury
well...
may
well
have
reached
the
same
verdict
had
the
prosecution
built
its
case
properly.
but
the
offense
was
not
so
defined,
and
appellate
courts
are
not
free
to
revise
the
basis
on
which
a
defendant
is
convicted
simply
because
the
same
result
would
likely
obtain
on
retrial.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
conjunction
with
the
principles
enunciated
in
kotteakos,
and
in
dunn,
and
in
mcelroy
and
in
king
in
the
first
circuit,
that
the
first
circuit
decision
should
stand.
thank
you.
