justice
stewart
in
any
event,
it's
common
ground
there
has
to
be
an
enterprise.
justice
stewart
and
enterprise
is
defined
in
the
statute
how,
where
is
it?
justice
stewart
a
corporation
would
be
an
enterprise.
justice
stewart
or
a
corporate
association.
justice
stewart
where
is
the
statutory
definition?
justice
stewart
what
do
you
think
the
statute
means
when
it
says
enterprise
includes
any
individual?
justice
stewart
so
one
person
could
be
prosecuted
under
rico?
justice
stewart
if
he
were
carrying
on
an
illegitimate...
the
illegitimate
business
of
bank
robbery?
justice
stewart
under
the
statutory
definition
do
you
submit
that
he
could?
justice
stewart
if
he
were
an
individual
entrepreneur
bank
robber
he
could
be
prosecuted
under
rico?
could
he?
justice
stewart
well
what
circumstances?
justice
stewart
no,
he's
not
holding
himself
out.
that's
just
his
way
of
life,
he
robs
banks.
justice
stewart
what's
this
got
to
do
with
a
similar
plan?
if
he
is
an
individual--
justice
stewart
--enterprise
includes
any
individual
this
says.
justice
stewart
and
that
means
that
any
person
who
is
a
repetitive
offender
can
be
prosecuted
under
rico,
does
it?
justice
stewart
when
i
say
can
be
prosecuted
under
rico,
i
mean
not
necessarily.
justice
stewart
well
an
individual
operates
individually--
justice
stewart
--not
through
an
organization.
justice
stewart
well
in
every
circumstance,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
an
enterprise
includes
any
individual
this
says.
justice
stewart
he's
included.
justice
stewart
and
in
the
meantime
he's
a
bank
clerk.
justice
stewart
where
does
the
statute
exempt?
justice
stewart
well
i
just
wonder
then,
upon...
your
argument
rests
upon
the
statutory
definition
of
enterprise,
and
enterprise
includes
any
individual.
justice
stewart
well
it
includes
any
individual,
and--
justice
stewart
--and
therefore,
and
yet
the
government
has
never
utilized
that
against
an
individual?
justice
stewart
well,
it's
not
that
they
wished
them
to
be
immune
from
prosecution,
but
they...
congress
might
rationally
have
thought
entirely
illegitimate
businesses
are
already
prohibited
by
other
criminal
laws.
justice
stewart
it
wouldn't
have
been
totally
irrational
for
congress
to
say
well,
since
those
are
covered
by
existing
laws,
the
new
law
will
try
to
reach
something
else.
justice
stewart
and
because
of
its
primary
concern,
and
the
legislative
history
is
certainly
replete
with
this,
that
the
primary
concern
of
congress...
this
doesn't
totally
undercut
your
argument
at
all...
was,
the
infiltration
of
legitimate
business
by
organized
crime.
justice
stewart
but
the
enterprise
element
would
not
be.
justice
stewart
well,
it's
a
difference
of
opinion...
don't
you
think
your
case
might
be
a
little
easier?
justice
stewart
and
an
individual
could
be
a
victim,
if
he
were
an
individual
entrepreneur.
justice
stewart
an
individual
wrongdoer,
obviously,
it
would
be...
your
argument
is,
it
would
be
silly
to
apply
rico
to
an
individual
wrongdoer.
justice
stewart
it's
illegal
activity.
justice
stewart
then
the
enterprise
is
the
drugstore,
it's
not
the
individual?
justice
stewart
or
usurious
debts?
