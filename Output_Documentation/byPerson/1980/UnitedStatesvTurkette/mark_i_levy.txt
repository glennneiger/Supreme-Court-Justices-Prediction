mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
respondent
was
convicted
by
a
jury
on
eight
counts
of
substantive
drug
and
mail
fraud
offenses
and
on
one
count
of
conspiracy
under
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act.
in
brief,
the
evidence
at
trial,
the
sufficiency
of
which
was
not
challenged,
showed
the
respondent
organized
and
headed
a
criminal
association
that
engaged
in
a
continuing
course
of
illegal
activities
for
profit.
the
turkette
group
was
in
existence
for
more
than
a
two
year
period
and
was
involved
in
numerous
offenses,
including
the
theft
and
distribution
of
drugs,
the
commission
and
facilitation
of
mail
fraud
by
arson
and
other
means,
and
the
bribery
of
police
officers
and
witnesses
to
protect
these
illegal
activities.
the
group
operated
in
a
highly
structured
and
sophisticated
manner,
in
which
different
individuals
performed
specific
assigned
roles
to
further
the
group's
venture.
the
questions
presented
by
our
petition
are
whether
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
excludes
wholly
illegitimate
enterprises
like
respondent's
from
the
scope
of
its
coverage,
and
if
so,
whether
automatic
reversal
of
respondent's
otherwise
valid,
non
rico
convictions
required
on
grounds
of
misjoinder.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
correct.
and
the
court
below
stands
alone
in
reaching
that
anomalous
result.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
the
holding
of
the
court
below
was
that
enterprises
that
are
entirely
and
completely
illegal
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
principal
anti
racketeering
statute
in
the
federal
criminal
code.
that
strikes
us
as
an
anomalous
result,
and
every
other
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
issue
has
concluded
that
rico
is
not
restricted
to
legitimate
enterprises,
but
applies
to
illegitimate
enterprises
as
well.
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
distinguishes
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
enterprises.
on
the
contrary,
the
definition
of
enterprise
states
without
qualification
that
enterprise
includes
any
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact.
similarly,
the
substantive
provisions
of
rico
draw
no
distinction
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
enterprises,
but
refer
broadly
to
any
enterprise.
and
congress
specifically
reinforced
the
sweep
of
the
statute
by
providing
that
the
provisions
of
rico
shall
be
liberally
construed
to
effectuate
its
remedial
purposes.
in
addition,
despite
the
existence
of
an
extensive
definitional
section
for
the
key
terms
used
in
rico,
the
statute
offers
no
guidance
whatever
for
defining
the
words
legitimate
and
illegitimate
the
respondent
and
amici
seek
to
insert
into
the
statute.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
that's
difficult
to--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
think
one
knows
with
certainty,
because
the
meaning
of
the
terms
legitimate
and
illegitimate
are
by
no
means
self
evident,
and
neither
the
statute
nor
the
legislative
history
offer
any
guidance
on
the
meaning
of
those
terms.
simply
because
congress
didn't
have
that
concept
in
mind.
in
your
hypothetical,
for
example,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
impossible
to
know
what
are
the
salient
considerations
or
the
proportion
of
legal
and
illegal
activities--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
do,
because
we
think
both
"legitimate"
and
"illegitimate"
are
within
the
statute.
and
we
think
that
the
introduction
of
such
an
indefinite
term
as
legitimate
enterprise
would
complicate
and
protract
rico
trials,
and
would
lead
to
distinctions
according
to
degree
of
legitimacy
that
are
entirely
unrelated
to
congress'
purpose
to
eradicate
organized
crime.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
is
common
ground
that
there
has
to
be
an
enterprise.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
relevant
here,
enterprise
is
defined
as
an
entity
consisting
of
a
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact.
that's
the
statutory
definition
of
enterprise
under
which
this
prosecution
was
brought.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
a
corporation
would
also
be
an
enterprise.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
a
labor
union
would.
a
partnership.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it's
in
section
1961(4)
which
is
reprinted
in
our
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly
i
believe
there
is.
an
enterprise
is
an
entity
as
in
this
case,
a
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
enterprise
is
an
entity
looking
to
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
associate,
and
congress
used
the
word
associate
in
the
definition
of
entity,
we
think
that
means
that
the
group
of
individuals
had
to
join
together
to
form
a
confederacy
or
a
union
for
some
common
purpose
or
overall
objective.
we
think
that's
what
the
word
associate
means.
therefore,
if
there
were
simply
two
predicate
acts,
that
were
unrelated
to
an
enterprise,
or
simply
isolated
or
sporadic
criminal
activities,
then
they
would
not
violate
the
statute
because
there
would
be
no
enterprise.
congress
went
on
to--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
believe
what
that
means
is
that
an
individual
may
be
an
enterprise,
and--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
that
is
conceivable.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
let
me
say
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
government
has
never
brought
a
case--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
believe
he
could;
if
the
person
were
engaged
in
a
sole
proprietorship
of
crime
rather
than
a
partnership
in
crime,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--in
some
circumstances,
for
example--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--if
he
held
himself
out
as
being
engaged
in
the
business--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--and
he
does
it
repeatedly,
using
a
similar
plan.
if
there
were
two
people--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--if
two
people--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
not
necessarily.
it
says
that
it
might
be
but
that
it's
not
necessarily
so.
if
somebody
commits
two
isolated--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--yes.
i
think
that
a
single
individual
in
some
circumstances
can
be
prosecuted
under
rico,
that's
correct.
if
the
individual
engaged
in
conduct
that
if
it
were
done
by
two
people,
a
partnership
in
crime,
would
be
within
the
statute,
we
don't
think
congress
intended
an
immunity
simply
because
one
person
did
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
this
is
an
organized
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
you
can
organize
in
the
sense
that
you
engage
in
a
conduct
in
an
organized
ant
recurring--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
correct
in
some
circumstances.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
the
individual
is
acting
alone,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
an
individual
is
not
excluded
from
the
scope
of
the
statute
but--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
think
that
if
he
commits
two
bank
robberies
that
are
in
the
language
used
in
the
legislative
history,
sporadic
or
isolated,
he
commits
the
one
year
and
five
years
later,
bearing
no
relationship.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
for
example.
i
would
doubt
that
that
would
fall
under
rico.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
a
different
problem.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
might
well
violate--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
might
well
violate
the
statute.
but
as
i
say,
it's
a
little
hard
to
know
since
the
government
has
never
brought
a
prosecution
against
a
single
individual,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
and
the
provision
simply
hasn't
been
construed.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
does,
and
it
also
includes
a
group
of
individuals
associating--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
statute
does
provide
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
they
have
not--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
does.
and
a
prosecution
could
be
brought--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--you
might
be
able
to,
and
that
might
fall
within
either
subsections
(a)
or
(b),
depending
on
the
method
of
infiltration.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
fact
that
a
group
of
individuals
commit
two
illegal
acts
does
not
ipso
facto
establish
a
violation
of
the
statute.
the
two
illegal
acts,
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
have
to
occur
in
a
conduct
of
an
enterprise.
the
word
1961(4)--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--they
may
be,
but
they
are
not
necessarily.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
if
the
association
in
fact
is
formed
solely
to
commit
illegal
acts
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind
when
it
spoke
of
an
illegal
or
an
illegitimate
enterprise.
it's
hard
to
know
how
that
would
be
applied
in
a
particular
case
to
conclude--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that
was
the
suggestion
of
the
first
circuit,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
believe
it
is
without
merit;
that
there
is
nothing
that
makes
the
provisions
redundant
or
internally
inconsistent.
there
is
still
the
requirement
that
there
be
an
enterprise
or
an
entity
and
there
is
still
the
requirement
that
there
be
certain
criminal
acts.
it
may
well
be
true,
and
this
may
have
been
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind,
that
the
government's
proof
in
a
particular
case
will
be
much
the
same
to
show
the
pattern
element
of
the
offense
and
to
show
the
enterprise
element
of
the
offense;
the
fact
that
people
commit
a
series
of
offenses
together
may
be
a
grounds
for
the
jury
to
infer
that
they
had
joined
together
to
form
an
association
in
fact
that
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
an
enterprise.
but
the
fact
that
the
government's
proof
may
be
the
same
on
those
two
issues
does
not
make
them
any
less
separate
and
distinct
issues.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
i
think
the
second
clause
of
1961(4)
was
designed
to
expand
the
reach
of
the
word
enterprise
to
include
entities
that
are
not
in
contemplation
of
law
a
separate
and
definable--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well
a
union
would
be
one
example,
i
think.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
i
think
if
you
had
some
informal
group
of
individuals
who
formed
a
civic
association
or
a
bridge
club
or
something
like
that,
there
would
be
no
entity
in
the
legal
sense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
necessarily;
they
would
still
have
to
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activities
and
i
assume
most
bridge
players
would
not
do
that.
but
they
might
well
be
an
enterprise--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--and
that
were
a
violation
of
state
law?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it's
conceivable
that
the
statute--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--just
as
a
large
scale
gambling
syndicate
would
be.
i
don't
think--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
might
be,
or
under
the
travel
act,
or
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
i
think
that's...
certainly
incongruous
to
think
that
congress
in
passing
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
didn't
mean
to
take
into
account
the
cosa
nostra
or
the
mafia
in
the
prohibitions
of
the
act.
the
reading
of
rico
i've
just
suggested
to
encompass
illegitimate
as
well
as
legitimate
enterprises,
is
fully
consistent
with
and
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
the
statute's
purpose.
the
legislative
history
nowhere
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
statute
exclusively
to
the
infiltration
and
corruption
of
organized
or
legitimate
businesses...
and
to
exclude
racketeering
activities
pertaining
to
thoroughly
unlawful
operations
as
respondent
and
amici
urge.
indeed,
we
can
conceive
of
no
reason
and
the
respondent
and
amici
have
offered
none,
why
congress
would
have
wished
entirely
illegal
businesses
to
be
immune
from
the
provisions
of
rico.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
doubt
that
congress
could
have
drafted
the
statute
in
many
ways,
but
i
think
there's--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--by
definition,
any
prosecution
under
rico
has
to
involve
the
violation
of
some
other
statutes.
congress
passed
rico
to
supplement
those
existing
statutes
because
of
what
it
found
to
be
inadequacies--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--nobody
doubts
that
that
was
a
principal
concern
of
congress.
but
it
was
by
no
means
the
exclusive
concern,
and
the
legislative
history
doesn't
indicate
it
was.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right,
that
would
not
be
covered
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
as
we
read
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
congress
intended
rico
to
be
a
broad
gauged
weapon
in
a
full
scale
attack
on
racketeering
to
the
end
that
organized
crime
in
this
country
would
be
eradicated.
and
it
was
not
designed
for
some
narrow
and
technical
statute
in
the
manner
that
respondent
suggests.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
or
perhaps
disorganized
crime?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
don't
define
that.
we
think
in
general,
congress
used
that
term
in
a
rather
broad
sense,
as
you've
suggested,
to
mean
organized
criminal
activities
as
well
as
in
the
narrower
sense
to
mean
the
mob
or
the
cosa
nostra,
organized
crime
in
the
vernacular
sense.
i
think
they
were
concerned
about
racketeering,
about
organized
criminal--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
statute
offers
the
definition
of
what
congress
meant
by
racketeering,
and
those
are
the
enumerated
statutes
found
in
1961
subsection
1.
in
discussing
it,
i
think
congress
was
relying
to
some
extent
on
the
common
sense
view,
and
on
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well
i
think
it
had
in
mind
those
things,
but
it
didn't
by
any
means
limit
itself
to
that.
and
the
statute,
if
i
may
point
out,
does
not
require
that
the
defendant
need
be
a
member
of
an
organized
crime
or
organized,
criminal
activity,
much
as
in
culbert,
the
court
held
that
the
hobbs
act
was
not
limited
in
that
way.
the
statutory
statement
of
findings
in
the
legislative
history
of
rico
plainly
revealed
congress'
awareness
of
and
concern
over
organized
crime's
wholly
illegal
activities,
and
nothing
suggests
that
congress
intended
these
activities
to
be
left
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
by
confining
the
term
enterprise
to
legitimate
enterprises.
moreover
on
several
occasions,
congress
indicated
that
rico
would
apply
to
illegitimate
enterprises.
for
example,
in
the
senate
report,
in
discussing
the
civil
provisions
of
rico,
congress
referred
to
state
cases
in
which
civil
remedies
had
been
used
against
illegal
gambling
and
prostitution
businesses.
similarly,
senator
mcclellan,
the
principal
sponsor
of
the
legislation,
explained
that
rico
would
apply
to
the
counterfeit
phonograph
record
business,
to
the
illicit
prescription
drug
industry
and
to
stolen
and
counterfeit
credit
card
schemes,
all
those
being
wholly
illegal
operations.
in
the
same
vein,
congressman
poff,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
in
the
house
observed
that
truck
hijacking
operations
would
be
subject
to
rico;
again
an
indication
that
congress
understood
the
breadth
of
the
provisions
it
enacted.
congress
also
recognized
that
illegal
activities
constitute
the
economic
foundation
of
organized
crime
and
provide
the
money
and
power
used
to
used
to
infiltrate
and
corrupt
legitimate
businesses,
labor
unions
and
government
offices.
thus
even
if
the
sole
purpose
of
the
statute
were
to
prevent
the
infiltration
of
legitimate
organizations,
that
purpose
would
be
well
served
by
applying
rico
to
entirely
illegal
ventures
in
order
to
eliminate
the
economic
base
of
organized
crime--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
a
bakery,
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
not.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
association
over
that
period
of
time
to
which
the
two
predicate
acts
of
racketeering
were
related
to,
that
would
simply
be
in
contrast
sporadic
or
isolated
criminal
activity
and
that's
the
very
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
in
suggesting
that
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
rendered
the
statutory
element
enterprise
redundant
to
the
term
pattern
they
think
that
is--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--exactly
so.
in
the
hypothetical,
the
pattern
element
would
be
satisfied,--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
right.
now,
it's--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
it
would
be,
yes.
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
correct.
if
two
people
did
it,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
doubt
about
it.
i
don't
think
there's
any
immunity
provided
in
the
statute
for
the
fact
that
a
person
exists
as
a
sole
proprietorship...
rather
than
a
partnership--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
they
would,
although
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
bridge
clubs
would
be--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
correct.
i
repeat
that
our
case
doesn't
involve
a
single
individual,--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
believe
this
case
would
be
any
different
if
the
word
individual
in
the
definition
of
enterprise
had
been
omitted.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
our
case
would
since
it
involved
a
group
of
individuals
and
more
than
50
drug
store
burglaries,
for
example,
and
by
no
means
the
single
individual
or
a
sporadic
and
isolated
pattern
of
crime.
the
court
of
appeals
was
also
concerned
with
respect
to
the
redundancy
of
the
statute
about
applying
the
criminal
provisions
of
sections
1962(a)
and
(b)
and
the
civil
provisions
of
section
1964
to
illegitimate
enterprises.
we
have
discussed
that
in
the
brief,
and
we
don't
think
there
is
any
inconsistency
or
redundancy
in
applying
the
statute
that
way,
and
indeed
the
application
of
those
provisions
could
well
serve
congress'
purpose
to
eradicate
organized
crime
by
enabling
the
government
to
prosecute
a
defendant
who
used
racketeering
income,
for
example,
to
establish
an
illegal
narcotics
business
or
who,
in
the
words
of
amici,
muscled
into
an
existing
illegal
operation.
similarly
in
the
civil
provisions,
we
think
that
the
congressional
intent
would
be
fully
effectuated
if
any
person
injured
by
a
violation
of
the
statute,
including
an
illegitimate
enterprise,
would
be
able
to
seek
compensation
under
section
1964(c)
from
the
wrongdoer
for
the
injury
he
suffered
to
his
business
or
property.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
only
have
two
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
mr.
wall
has
argued
that
under
the
statute,
the
enterprise
must
be
the
victim
rather
than
the
means
of
the
commission
of
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
nothing
in
the
statute
suggests
or
requires
that,
and
indeed
the
fallacy
may
be
shown
by
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
the
zemek
case
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
where
the
owner
of
a
tavern
advanced
his
tavern
business
through
extortion
and
murder
of
his
competitors.
in
that
case,
the
enterprise
was
a
tavern
and
that
was
advanced
rather
than
being
the
victim
of
the
racketeering
activity.
second,
in
this
case,
there
were
legitimate
businesses
that
were
harmed
by
respondent's
conduct.
particularly
the
drugstores
that
were
burglarized
and
the
insurance
companies
that
were
defrauded
were
clearly
harmed
and
that
illustrates
how
the
application
of
rico
to
an
entirely
illegitimate
enterprise
can
serve
to
protect
legitimate
businesses
from
the
ill
effects
of
racketeering.
thank
you.
