we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
v.

mr.
levy,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief

or
was
it
that
they
were
so
well
organized
in
their
enterprise
that--
chief
justice
burger
--under
the
first
circuit
theory,
on
which
side
of
the
line
would
fall
an
enterprise
that
had
an
apparently
legitimate
front,
that
is,
a
truck
line,
or
whatever,
but
was--
chief
justice
burger
--was
engaged
75
percent
or
90
percent
in
shooting
for
hire,
killing
for
hire,
arson
for
hire
and
extortion
and
loan
sharking.
where
would
the
first
circuit
case
take
us?
chief
justice
burger
you
think
that's
irrelevant?
what
the
proportion
is?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
suppose
what
is
commonly
called
the
mafia
is
not
a
corporation
or
an
association,
but
it
would
be
covered
here?
chief
justice
burger
but
your
point
is,
the
mafia
which
is,
does
not
purport
to
be
a
legitimate
business,
would
be
covered
if
their
whole
objective
and
stated
purpose
was
illegal?
chief
justice
burger
that
is,
arson
for
hire,
murder
for
hire,
or
kidnapping
for
hire?
chief
justice
burger
let's
take
another
one.
a
single
individual
who
talks
to
no
one,
but
simply
goes
around
to
a
series
of
pharmacies
and
says
to
the
proprietor,
i
want
to
buy
x
number
of
certain
drugs,
cocaine
and
some
others,
without
a
prescription
and
you
either
give
them
to
me
or
your
windows
will
be
broken
as
fast
as
you
can
replace
them.
and
he
goes
around
to
ten
establishments
and
gets
the
cocaine
and
sells
it.
is
that
an
enterprise?
chief
justice
burger
whether
there's
one,
two
or
ten,
it's
an
enterprise,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
levy.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
burger
well
let's
accept
that
it
does
all
those
things,
what
do
you
say
it
can't
do?
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
say
that
it
can't
do?
this
statute.
chief
justice
burger
well
are
you
saying
there
must
be
a
legitimate
business
involved,
and
then
there
is
some
illegitimate
penetration
of
that,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
burger
it
would
have
to
be
totally
illegitimate
from
the
outset?
chief
justice
burger
in
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
your
friend
about
the
individual,
just
one
man,
who
goes
around
to
the...
a
dozen
pharmacies
and
says
you
sell
me
500
units
of
cocaine
every
week,
or
your
windows
will
be
broken.
you
say
that
would
not
be
covered
because
that's
one
person,
and
it's
totally
illegal
from
the
start,
it
has
no
legal
front.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you
get
away
from
the
word...
the
first
category
under
subsection
(4)
is
any
individual,
partnership,
and
then
the
whole
array,
seriatim.
why
weren't
they
trying
to
get
at
this
one
strong
armed
extortionist?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
wall,
would
you
say
the
loners
who
engage
in
this
activity
are
not
covered
by
rico?
they
must
have
at
least
one
other
colleague
helping
them.
chief
justice
burger
extortion
of
the
druggist.
well
i
had
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
whether
he
be
a
loner,
whether
it
be
an
association
of
two
or
100,
it's
not
covered.
chief
justice
burger
i
was
just
starting
with
the
first
category,
i
was
going
to
take
you
through
the
rest
of
them.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
not
covered
if
it's
illegal
from
its
inception?
chief
justice
burger
i
mean,
how
do
you
square
your
previous
statement--
chief
justice
burger
previously,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
term
enterprise
was
just
a
one
way
street,
applied
only
to
one
of
the
two,
that
is,
victim
or
criminal
actor,
you
said
it
couldn't
apply
to
the
criminal
actor?
doesn't
1962(c)
explicitly
apply
to
the
criminal
actor
and
the
victim;
or
neither
one?
chief
justice
burger
let's
suppose
something
less.
let's
suppose
that
if
some
group,
one
or
21
people,
set
up
a
specialty
of
collecting
illegal
debts.
that
is,
usurious
debts,
gambling
debts,
any
other
kind,
and
that's
all
they
do.
you
say
they
are
not
covered?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean,
they
can't
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
burger
destroys
them
or
supplements
them?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
this
one
of
the
broadest
nets
that
congress
has
ever
thrown
out
to
catch
criminal
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
levy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
