so
any
professional
criminal
in
the
sense
that
this
is
his
business--
justice
white
--is
a
criminal
enterprise
for
purposes
of
rico.
well
how
can
you
organize
one
person?
justice
white
well
the
statute
does
define
an
enterprise
as
any
individual,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well
then
certainly
you
could,
i
suppose,
one
person
could
infiltrate
another
individual,
i
mean,
if
you
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
your
own
activities
you
could
subvert
an
individual
proprietorship
of
another.
justice
white
after
your
answers
to
my
colleagues'
questions,
i
get
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you,
mr.
levy.
if
an
individual
may
be
an
enterprise
and
a
group
of
persons
who
commit
a
pattern
of
activities,
that
is,
two
predicate
acts,
may
also
be
an
enterprise,
then
how...
what
is
the
difference
between
them
and
an
illegal
enterprise?
justice
white
just
like
it
might
be
prosecuted
now,
under
state
law?
justice
white
playing
for
money.
justice
white
well
if
you
could
win
your
case
without
conceding
that
the
individual
could
be,
himself,
prosecuted?
justice
white
but
your
argument
does.
even
if
you
put
the
individual
aside
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
silly,
then
it
would
be--
--your
argument
involves
that
statute,
that
part
of
the
statutory
definition
or
more
accurately,
your
opponent's
argument,
because
that
implies
that
the
individual
has
to
be...
is
engaged
in
a
legitimate
enterprise,
and
he
has
to
be
infiltrated
by
criminal
activity.
justice
white
i
think
your
case
would
be
a
little
easier.
