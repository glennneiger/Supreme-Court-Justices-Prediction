justice
rehnquist
well
the
first
circuit
theory
really
was
that
these
people
were
so
totally
illegal
that
they
had
to
be
acquitted,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
kind
of
like
the
aliens?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
levy,
there
are
a
number
of
kind
of
ambiguous
phrases
in
the
briefs
and
so
on,
yet
as
you
pointed
out
illegitimate
and
legitimate...
pose
questions
in
the
brief
of
what
is
organized
crime
as
opposed
to
unorganized
crime?
justice
rehnquist
or
disorganized
crime.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's
racketeering?
justice
rehnquist
for
buying
protection,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
but
how
about
1961
subsection
5,
where
it
defines
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
as
at
least
two
acts
of
racketeering
activity,
one
of
which
occurred
after
the
effective
date
of
this
chapter
and
the
last
of
which
occurred
within
ten
years,
including
any
period
of
imprisonment.
wouldn't
my
brother
brennan's
example
come
under
that?
no,
but
your
answer
to
my
brother
brennan
i
understood,
was
to
underline
your
argument
that
there
first
of
all
has
to
be
an
enterprise,
in
which
the
test
is
different.
justice
rehnquist
well,
as
long
as
you've
lost
your
train
of
thought
for
a
moment,
the
word
enterprise
as
contained
in
the
definitional
section
of
the
statute
doesn't
make
any
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
entities,
does
it?
justice
rehnquist
i'm
talking
about
1961(4)
where
it
says
enterprise
includes
any
individual,
partnership,
corporation,
association
or
other
legal
entity
and
any
union
or
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
although
not
a
legal
entity.
justice
rehnquist
--but
you're
not
observing
congress'
admonition
that
organized
crime
may
find
all
sorts
of
ways
to
get
around
these
definitions.
justice
rehnquist
certainly
in
1962...
goes
after
some
variety
of
criminal
behavior?
i
mean,
this
whole
part
that
we're
talking
about
isn't
for
the
benefit
of
the
victims.
it
was
to
create
criminal
offenses.
justice
rehnquist
but
1962
also
makes
criminal
some
conduct,
does
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
so
it
isn't
as
if
it
were
just
kind
of
a
reparation
statute
or
a
victim
of
crime
statute.
it
in
itself
makes
certain
acts
criminal
that
weren't
otherwise
made
criminal.
