justice
jr.
thank
you.
well
mr.
levy,
is
there
a
difference
between
an
illegal
enterprise
and
the
coverage
under
the
act
of
a
group
of
persons
who
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activities,
that
is
two
predicate
acts,
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
jr.
well
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
what
distinguishes
a
group
of
persons
who
commit
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activities,
that
is,
two
predicate
acts
from
an
illegal
enterprise?
justice
jr.
well
i
know,
but
you've
already
told
us
an
individual
may
be
an
enterprise,
a
group
of
persons
committing
two
predicate
acts
may
be
an
enterprise.
justice
jr.
well
then
i
still
ask
you
what...
how
are
either
of
those
distinguished
from
"an
illegal
enterprise"?
aren't
they
illegal
enterprises?
justice
jr.
well
of
course,
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
the
first
circuit
as
i
read
their
opinion,
had
the
idea
that
to
include
an
illegal
enterprise
within
1962(c)
would
make
that
section
internally
redundant.
justice
jr.
what
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
is
is
that
idea
wholly
without
merit?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
mr.
levy,
looking
at
1961(4),
what's
the
meaning
of
"union
or
group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact
although
not
a
legal
entity.
"
what's
that
supposed
to
mean?
justice
jr.
can
you
illustrate
that?
justice
jr.
well,
no,
they
say...
expressly
a
union...
what's
"group
of
individuals
associated
in
fact,
although
not
a
legal
entity?
"
justice
jr.
this
even
reaches
bridge
clubs,
rico?
justice
jr.
this
even
reaches
bridge
clubs,
does
it?
justice
jr.
but
even
as
my
brother
white
just
suggested
what
if
they
play
for
money?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
the
bridge
club
might
be
prosecuted,
under
rico?
justice
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
levy,
does
that
go
this
far...
say
two
men
robbed
a
bakery
today--
justice
jr.
--two
men
robbed
a
bakery.
justice
jr.
they
never
see
one
another
for
another
eight
years
and
then
they
run
into
one
another
and
they
decide,
let's
go
ahead
and
rob
another
one.
so
they
rob
a
second
bakery
eight
years
later.
are
they
vulnerable
to
a
rico
prosecution?
justice
jr.
what
would
have
to
be,
i
gather,
the
two
would...
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
robbery,
let's
go
into
the
business
of
robbery.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
that
then
would
be
an
enterprise.
justice
jr.
but
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
they
were
just
isolated
acts
with
no
agreement
between
them
to
make
this
a
regular
pattern
of
living.
justice
jr.
well
then
in
that
bridge
example
we
were
talking
about
earlier.
the
ladies
would
have
to
agree
on
the
pattern
of
gambling,
would
they,
over
the
years?
justice
jr.
mr.
wall,
i
gather
from
what
you
said
much
earlier,
you
read
1962(c)
as
addressed
to
a
situation
in
which
some
employee
or
somebody
associated
with
a
legitimate
enterprise,
sets
about
conducting
that
legitimate
enterprise
in
business
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity
or
collection
of
unlawful
debt.
and
that
that's
as
far
as
that
section
goes,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
that
very
narrow
reading?
justice
jr.
this
is
all
part
of
your
basic
argument
that
congress
was
more
interested
in
protecting
a
victim
from--
justice
jr.
--infiltration
or
otherwise--
justice
jr.
--what's
collection
of
unlawful
debt?
justice
jr.
was
the
denial
of
severance
appealed?
justice
jr.
after
conviction?
justice
jr.
what
about
the
sentences?
on
the
substantive
counts,
didn't
he
not
get
sentences
concurrent
with
the
sentence
under
the
rico
count?
justice
jr.
but
he
had...
how
was
he
prejudiced?
the
sentences
under
the
substantive
counts
stand,
don't
they?
justice
jr.
the
reversal
gave
them
a
new
trial,
does
it?
justice
jr.
gave
them
a
new
trial.
justice
jr.
just
on
the
substantive
counts,
i
gather?
justice
jr.
did
the
united
states
urge
harmless
error
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
and
decided
it
against
them?
