chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
difrancesco.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
burger
what
was
the
maximum
he
could
have
gotten?
thirty?
chief
justice
burger
if
they
had
not
been
made
concurrent?
chief
justice
burger
was
it
the
concurrence
of
the
sentences--
chief
justice
burger
--the
sentence
is
not
final--
chief
justice
burger
--until
the
court
of
appeals--
chief
justice
burger
--the
sentence
of
the
district
court,
then,
is
not
final
until
the
time
to
appeal
has
expired
or
until
the
court
of
appeals
has
reviewed
it.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
any
doubt
whatever
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
the
bracketed
material
is
fully
supported?
chief
justice
burger
is
there
any
doubt
that
that
is...
any
doubt
on
the
record?
chief
justice
burger
we
don't
have
to
reach
a--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nemoyer.
chief
justice
burger
but
how
is
that
relevant
to
our
problem?
chief
justice
burger
well,
that's
not.
he
was
just
mentioning
that
that's
the
genesis
of
congressional
concern
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
statute.
that's
nothing
more
than
that.
chief
justice
burger
but
the
parole
board's
power
doesn't
include
any
power
to
enlarge
a
sentence,
does
it?
chief
justice
burger
however,
from
page
36
of
the
appendix
on
up
to
42
and
3,
they
recite
that
this
fellow
has
committed
everything
except
possibly
rape
and
bank
robberies.
he's
got
murder,
arson,
arson-for-hire,
bombing,
mail
fraud,
extortion,
and
loan
sharking.
now,
those
are
all
part
of
the
judge's
recitals,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
the
judge
just
rubberstamped
those
statements
about
his
past
record?
chief
justice
burger
how
does
that
help
you
very
much?
i'm
a
little
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
you
think
that
helps,
to
erase
all
of
this
record.
for
example,
by
way
of
summary,
he
says,
"a
review
of
the
defendant's
criminal
record
shows
four
other
convictions
in
state
and
federal
courts
for
crimes
committed
since
1970
in
the
rochester
area.
"
"the
same
review
reveals
a
history
of
virtually
continuous
criminal
conduct
over
the
past
eight
years,
interrupted
only
by
relatively
brief
periods
of
imprisonment
in
'75,
'76,
and
'77.
"
now,
are
you
suggesting
the
judge
didn't
know
what
he
was
signing
when
he
signed
that?
chief
justice
burger
arson
isn't
usually
directed
at
hurting
people,
is
it?
chief
justice
burger
the
judge
read
the
whole
document
closely
enough
to
run
a
line
through
2-1/2
lines,
i
think
it
is,
or--
chief
justice
burger
about
eight
lines
later
he
did
not
strike
out
the
statement
or
alter
in
any
way
that
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
most
recent
felonies
and
"is
a
dangerous
special
offender
within
the
meaning
of
section
3575.
"
and
so
forth.
anything
ambiguous
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
do
you
suppose...
are
you
suggesting
congress
wasn't
aware
of
all
these
considerations?
chief
justice
burger
how
many
appeals
has
the
government
taken
since
this
statute
was
passed?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
burger
it
doesn't
suggest
that
there
was
a
flood
tide.
chief
justice
burger
that's
not
before
us
now,
is
it?
no
question
of
that
kind
is
here
now.
congress
hasn't
even
acted
yet.
chief
justice
burger
well,
there's
one
thing,
if
you're
talking
about
finality
in
terms
of
appeal,
and
another
if
you're
talking
about
final
in
the
double
jeopardy
sense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
you
have
only
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
