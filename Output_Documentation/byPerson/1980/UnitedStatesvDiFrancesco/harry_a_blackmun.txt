justice
blackmun
are
you
bringing
this
material
up
because
you
feel
that
an
affirmance
here
would
jeopardize
the
whole
concept
of
appellate
review
of
sentencing?
justice
blackmun
incidentally,
is
this
the
first
government
appeal
under
3576?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
other
case,
difrancesco
against
the
united
states
comes
to
us
by
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
organized
crime
control
act
of
1970
grants
the
united
states
the
right
under
specified
conditions
to
appeal
the
sentence
imposed
upon
what
is
described
as
a
dangerous
special
offender.
and
thus,
the
statute
touches
to
a
limited
degree
upon
the
concept
of
appellate
review
of
sentences.
the
respondent,
difrancesco
was
convicted
of
federal
racketeering
offenses
at
his
trial
on
a
federal
court,
and
he
was
sentenced
as
a
dangerous
special
offender
to
two
10-year
prison
terms
to
be
served
concurrently
with
each
other
and
with
a
9-year
sentence
previously
imposed
on
other
convictions
at
an
unrelated
federal
trial.
the
united
states
sought
review
claiming
that
the
district
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
imposing
sentences
that
amounted
to
additional
imprisonment
for
only
one
year
in
the
face
of
the
findings
the
court
made
after
the
dangerous
special
offender
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
and
not
on
the
merits
and
it
is
that
issue,
double
jeopardy
which
comes
here.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
and
majority
of
us
reverse
that
decision
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
rule
first
that
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
guarantee
against
multiple
trials.
the
government's
appeal
presents
no
threat
of
a
successive
prosecution
just
because
its
success
might
deprive
the
respondent
with
a
benefit
of
a
more
lenient
sentence
and
we
rule
second
that
the
--
an
increase
of
the
sentence
of
review
does
not
constitute
multiple
punishment.
here,
congress
has
specifically
provided
that
the
sentence
is
subject
to
appeal
in
any
argument
that
the
defendant
precedes
the
length
of
his
sentence
as
finally
determined
when
he
begins
to
serve
it
as
no
force
where
there
can
be
no
expectation
of
finality
in
the
original
sentence.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion.
