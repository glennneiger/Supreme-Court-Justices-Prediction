justice
stevens
--mr.
frey,
under
your
understanding
of
the
appeal
procedure,
if
the
trial
judge
makes
an
error
of
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
wants
to
reverse
and
does
reverse,
may
the
court
of
appeals
remand
for
a
second
sentencing
hearing?
justice
stevens
does
that
create
any...
well--
justice
stevens
mr.
frey,
before
you
leave
the
first
point
on
the
anxiety
interest
and
so
forth
on
the
appeal
thing,
it
just
ran
through
my
mind,
taking
the
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb
and
so
forth...
rather
strong
language,
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
if
we
accept
your
argument
we
would
also...
because
it's
a
constitutional
provision
applicable
to
the
states,
probably
be
holding
that
in
order
to
achieve
uniformity
in
the
death
area,
it
would
be
permissible
in
a
state
case,
capital
case
from
one
of
the
states
that
has
capital
punishment,
to
permit
the
prosecution...
if
the
appropriate
statute
were
enacted,
of
course...
to
appeal
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
impose
the
death
sentence?
is
that
interest
involved,
would
you
say?
justice
stevens
right,
just
on
double
jeopardy.
justice
stevens
the
interest
in
avoiding
disparity
has
been
identified
in
those
cases
as
well
as
here.
