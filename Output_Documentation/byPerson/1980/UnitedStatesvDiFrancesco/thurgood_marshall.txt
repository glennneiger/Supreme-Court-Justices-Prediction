mr.
frey,
on
this
record
in
this
appendix,
is
there
anything
else
in
there
but
what's
in
this
appendix?
justice
marshall
all
i
find
in
there
is
the
indictment
and
the
transcript.
justice
marshall
this
transcript
says
that
the
transcript
of
the
trial
itself
was
introduced,
and
the
indictment.
justice
marshall
well,
it
would
be
material
to
me,
sir.
i
want...
this
is
material.
what
is
there
at
the
hearing
on
the
new
charge
that
wasn't
in
the
original?
justice
marshall
the
sentencing
hearing;
yes,
sir.
justice
marshall
would
you
point
that
out,
please?
i
think
you'll
find
it
was
in
the
original
record.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
any
witnesses
at
all.
justice
marshall
that's
right.
justice
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
sentencing
hearing
that
could
not
have
been
put
into
the
original
trial
in
the
original
sentence?
justice
marshall
well,
the
original
sentencing
was
before
the
same
judge.
justice
marshall
how
come
he
gave
him
ten
years?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
thought;
after
that
trial.
justice
marshall
at
which
time
he
could
put
all
of
this
in.
and
at
that
trial
he
could
have
gotten
40
years,
couldn't
he?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
it...
you
could
have
gotten
40?
justice
marshall
did
you
say
it
was
the
first
time
they've
tried
it?
justice
marshall
well,
you
ought
to
get
your
information
updated.
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
mean
any...
doesn't
mean
anything
in
this
case,
does
it?
