when
you
say
"they",
you
refer
to
congress,
i
take
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
it
congress
that
authorized
these
appeals?
justice
rehnquist
--is
it
on
43,
mr.
nemoyer,
and
only
43,
that
there
is
the
bracketed
material
is
included,
just
at
the
very
end
there?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
after
a
bench
trial
and
a
finding
of
guilty
and
the
judge
who
tried
the
case
from
the
bench
dies,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy
for
another
judge
to
come
in
and
impose
sentence?
justice
rehnquist
our
double
jeopardy
rules
change
every
two
years
too.
