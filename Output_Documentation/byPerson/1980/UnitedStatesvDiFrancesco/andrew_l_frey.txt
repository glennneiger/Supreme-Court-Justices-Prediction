mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
criticisms
most
frequently
leveled
against
the
operation
of
the
federal
criminal
justice
system
concerns
the
manner
in
which
sentences
are
meted
out
to
persons
convicted
of
crime.
these
criticisms
focus
on
the
nearly
unbridled
discretion
that
is
currently
afforded
a
single
individual,
the
district
judge.
as
an
almost
inevitable
result
of
this
discretion,
gross
disparities
may
frequently
occur
in
the
sentences
handed
out
to
similarly
situated
offenders
for
comparable
criminal
conduct.
these
disparities
adversely
affect
the
public
perception
of
the
fairness
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
they
also
engender
understandable
bitterness
on
the
part
of
those
defendants
who
receive
harsh
sentences
when
they
look
at
others
similarly
situated
who
have
received
much
more
lenient
ones.
there
is,
in
sum,
a
widespread
feeling
that
something
should
be
done
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
unequal
sentencing.
now,
one
obvious
means
of
accomplishing
this
goal
is
a
system
of
appellate
review
of
sentences.
in
fact,
the
adoption
of
such
a
system
is
one
of
the
principal
reforms
proposed
in
the
pending
criminal
code
revision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
believe
it's
passed
the
senate
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
passed
the
house.
i
am
told
that
it
may
or
may
not
get
passed
during
the
lame
duck
session
after
the
election.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
sure
that
if
it
passes
the
house
and
the
senate
that
conference
will
be
required--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
believe
it
hasn't
passed
the
house
yet.
now,
under
the
senate
version
of
the
bill,
there
would
be
a
sentencing
commission.
and
this
commission
would
establish
ranges
of
sentences
for
various
offenses.
and
when
the
district
court
went
to
sentence
it
would
have
the
unfettered
discretion
to
sentence
within
those
guidelines.
but
if
it
imposed
a
sentence
above
the
guideline,
the
defendant
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
and
if
it
imposed
a
sentence
below
the
guideline,
the
government
would
have
a
right
to
appeal.
and
in
either
case
the
judge
would
have
to
make
a
statement
of
reasons
for
departing
from
the
guidelines,
and
those
reasons
would
be
subject
to
review
for
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
certainly
an
affirmance
based
on
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
would
cast
in
serious
doubt
the
validity
of
the
proposed
approach.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
the
first
appeal
of
a
sentence
itself
as
distinct
from
the
determination
of
the
court
not
to
treat
a
particular
defendant
as
a
dangerous
special
offender.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
was
1970.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
so.
now,
i
think...
it
is
my
view
that
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
adopt
this
kind
of
reform
is
likely
to
depend
on
the
disposition
of
this
case.
now,
it's
true
that
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
prevent
congress
from
allowing
defendants
to
appeal
sentences
that
are
considered
excessive,
but
i
think
it's
apparent
that
this
will
not
solve
the
problems
created
by
a
perception
of
irrational
sentencing
discrepancies
because
those
are
equally
a
product
of
undue
leniency
as
of
undue
severity.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
the
statute
does
not
speak
to
that,
but
of
course
what
we
are
talking
about
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
this
statute
is
not
a
de
novo
sentencing
proceeding
but
an
appellate
review.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
my
view--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
in
my
view,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
are
elements--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it's
generally
true
that
a
hearing
on
a
suppression
motion
also
has
many
protections
which
are
not
available
when
the
court
of
appeals
reviews
it,
but
there
is
an
allocation
of
function
to
the
extent
a
sentence
may
properly
be
based
on
the
demeanor,
on
the
statements
of
the
defendant
at
allocution.
i
think
those
would,
those
considerations--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--would
essentially...
no,
but
to
the
extent
it's
based
on
things
that
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
have
before
it,
i
think
those
factors
would
be
unreviewable.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
finds
that
there
is
a
legal
error...
let
us
say,
for
example
that
the
district
court
decides
that
hearsay
is
not
to
be
considered
and
therefore
it
says,
i
would
have
sentenced
you
to
25
years
had
i
considered
this
information
about
your
organized
crime
connections,
but
i
don't
believe
i
can
consider
it,
and
therefore
i
will
only
sentence
you
to
five,
then
that
would
be--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--a
pure
legal
error.
or
if
a
judge
said,
normally
i
would
give
you
a
very
severe
sentence,
but
because
you're
a
woman
i
don't
think
women
should
be
dealt
with
this
severely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
a
legal
error,
however,
that
i
think
could
perfectly
well
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
government
appeal.
now,
it's
not
my
job
today
to
persuade
this
court
that
prosecution
appeals
of
sentences
are
a
good
policy,
because
that
decision
in
the
case
of
the
dangerous
special
offender
statute
has
been
made
by
the
congress
after
careful
study
of
the
problem,
and
what
this
court
has
to
decide
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
congress
from
implementing
such
a
policy
even
though
congress
has
determined
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
in
the
present
case,
respondent
was
convicted
of
violation
of
the
rico
statute
as
a
result
of
his
role
in
an
arson-for-hire
ring.
because
of
his
extensive
criminal
record
and
his
major
role
in
the
ring,
the
government
invoked
the
provisions
of
the
dangerous
special
offender
statute,
and
after
a
hearing
before
the
district
court,
findings
were
entered
which
included
the
following,
and
i
read
from
page
43
of
the
appendix:
"this
criminal
history
of
the
respondent,
based
upon
proven
facts,
reveals
a
pattern
of
habitual
and
knowing
criminal
conduct
of
the
most
violent
and
dangerous
nature
against
the
lives
and
property
of
the
citizens
of
this
community.
"
"it
further
shows
the
defendant's
complete
and
utter
disregard
for
the
public
safety.
"
"defendant
by
virtue
of
his
own
criminal
record
has
shown
himself
to
be
a
hardened,
habitual
criminal
from
whom
the
public
must
be
protected
for
as
long
a
period
as
possible.
"
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
the
record
below?
i
imagine
there
is,
but
i
can't
tell
you
what
it--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there's
nothing
in
here
from
the
trial.
this
is
the
transcript
of
the
dangerous
special
offender's
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
have
not
examined
those
things
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
would
be
material
to
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
today.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
at
the
sentencing
hearing?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
information
relating
to
other
offenses
in
which
respondent
was
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
there
are
not
witnesses.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
there
was
no...
but
this
was
in
essence
stipulated
to,
and
his
status
as
a
special
offender
was
predicated
as
the
statute
permits.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
well,
the
original
trial
before
a
jury,
it
would
be
prejudicial
to
put
in.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no;
no,
no.
there
was
no
previous
sentencing
of
this
defendant
prior,
on
these
charges
prior
to
the
dangerous
special
offender.
he
was
tried
before
judge
pratt
in
connection
with--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--he
was
tried
before
judge
pratt
in
connection
with
the
so-called
columbus
day
bombings
in
rochester.
he
was
convicted
by
judge
pratt
and
he
was
given
nine
years
for
the
offenses
related
to
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
tried
before
judge
burke
on
the
racketeering
charges
involving
the
arson-for-hire
ring.
he
was
convicted.
then
this
hearing
was
held
before
the
court
under
the
dangerous
special
offender
statute,
which
was
a
special
sentencing--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--after
that
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
could
have
gotten...
well,
there
is
a
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
would
depend
on
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
rico
conspiracy
and
the
rico
substantive
offense
are
separate
offenses
where
the
enterprise
that's
alleged
is
an
association
in
fact.
i'm
not
certain
that
he
could
have
gotten
40
years.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
he
could
have
gotten
20
years
clearly
on
this
count.
and
it
is
possible
judge--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
sentences
were
concurrent...
well,
both
the
rico
conspiracy
and
the
rico
substantive
offense
carry
20-year
penalties.
if
those
are
two
separate
offense
under
the
jeffers/whalen
line
of
cases,
then
he
could
have
by
making
the
sentences
consecutive
has
gotten
40
years,
and
this
was
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--at
least
he
could
have
gotten
20.
in
fact,
what
he
got
was
ten
years
concurrent
with
the
sentences
in
the
bombing
charges,
so
in
effect
what
he
got
as
a
result--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--of
the
arson
ring
was
one
year
in
addition
to
sentences
he
already
was
required
to
serve.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
statute
authorizes
it;
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
believe
that
would
create
a
constitutional
problem
because
i
don't
believe...
i
think
it
is
clear,
for
instance,
that
if
you
had
a
post-trial
suppression
hearing
which...
and
the
evidence
was
suppressed
as
in
ceccolini
and
the
government
appealed
and
the
appellate
court
concluded
that
further
hearings
were
required
and
a
remand
to
clarify
certain
points,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
do
that
and
a
further
hearing
could
be
held.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
the
present
case
we
are
not
challenging
any
finding
of
fact,
we
are
not
asking
for
any
further
hearing.
we
are
seeking
purely
an
appellate-type
proceeding
and
not
a
second
trial
if
you
are
going
to
equate
the
sentencing
with
the
trial.
so
this
case
is
stronger
for
us,
although
i
believe
that
a
remand
hearing
would
be
permissible
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
we'll
try
to
get
to
these
arguments.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
permits
the
appellate
court
on
either
the
government's
or
the
defendant's
appeal
to
impose
a
different
sentence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
to
remand
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
i
think
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prevents
the
defendant
from
being
required
to
do
is
to
be
tried
again
after
he's
been
acquitted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it's
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
sentence
is
not
final.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
this
is
a
kind
of...
if
jeopardy
is
involved
at
this
point,
if
it
hasn't
terminated
with
the
verdict
of
guilty,
this
is
a
kind
of
continuing
jeopardy
theory.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
take
it
it's
fair
to
conclude
that
there
was
some
inconsistency
in
judge
burke's
findings
and
his
sentencing.
indeed,
that
would
be
the
part
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
consider
in
the
event
we--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
would
be
our
position,
and
that
his
findings
were
amply
supported
by--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
we
would,
under
the
statute,
we
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
if
he's
determined
that
respondent
was
not
a
dangerous
special
offender.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
have
a
right
to
appeal
the
question,
whether
that
determination
was
supported.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
believe
that
the
consequences
of
all
that
would
be
a
problem
for
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
our
appeal,
and
not
a
problem
that
should
delay
this
court
in
its
consideration
of
the
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
to
entertain
the
appeal;
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
nothing
as
to
the
merits.
we
are
not
asking--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
think
it's
any
help
in
this
court.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
to
us
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
guess
my
colleague
will
probably...
may
wish
to
argue
the
contrary,
but
our
position
is
that
it's
amply
supported
by
the
record
that
shows
an
extended
career
of
serious--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it's
not
a
matter
for
you
to
determine;
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
before
i
begin
with
my
main
legal
argument,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
three
articles
that
have
either
just
come
out
or
about
to
come
out
that
the
court
may
find
helpful,
dealing
specifically
with
the
difrancesco
case.
two
of
them
appear
in
the
december,
1980,
edition
of
the
american
criminal
law
review.
the
first
one,
which
is
by
ron
stern,
starts
at
volume
18,
page
51.
that
has
just
come
out,
and
that
one
supports
the
government's
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
ronald
stern,
your
former
law
clerk.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
second
one
supports
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
stern's
agrees
with
our
position.
and
then
there
is
a--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
he
did
but
he
is
in
private
practice
now.
there
is
also
an
article
by
professor
weston
in
the
june,
1980.
michigan
law
review,
a
preprint
of
which
was
sent
both
to
myself
and
to
opposing
counsel
and
to
the
court,
and
i
understand
it
will
be
out
in
several
weeks.
it's
a
fairly
lengthy
treatment
of
this
problem.
now,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
and,
of
course,
it's
our
position
that
the
burden
is
on
those
who
attack
the
statute
to
demonstrate
how
it
offends
the
policies
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
three
possible
objections.
the
first
is
that
the
appeal
itself
constitute
an
impermissible
second
jeopardy.
the
second
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
vests
the
defendant
with
the
right
to
have
his
sentence
treated
with
the
same
kind
of
finality
as
an
acquittal
would
be
treated.
and
the
third
is
the
argument
that
an
increase
of
the
sentence
on
appeal
constitutes
a
form
of
multiple
punishment
that's
prohibited
by
double
jeopardy
concepts.
of
course,
we
believe
that
none
of
these
objections
to
government
sentence
appeals
is
well-founded.
the
first
objection
relates,
i
think,
to
the
notion
that
the
defendant
should
be
spared
the
expense
and
anxiety
and
uncertainty
of
a
proceeding
that
may
result
in
an
increase
of
his
sentence,
a
second
proceeding
after
the
original
sentencing
proceeding.
of
course,
as
i
have
mentioned,
in
this
case
at
least
the
second
proceeding
is
not
at
all
like
that
but
it
is
on
appeal
argued
by
lawyers
which
the
defendant
does
not
even
attend
and
which
is
limited
to
a
review
of
the
record
made
in
the
district
court.
the
second
difficulty
with
this
argument
that
the
appeal
itself
is
something
which
a
defendant
has
protection
from
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
that
it's
well
settled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
wilson
and
scott
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
protect
against
appeals
as
such.
in
both
wilson
and
scott
the
defendant
had
won
a
dismissal
of
the
charges
which
would
have
made
him
a
free
man,
and
in
each
case
the
appeal
threatened
to
jeopardize
that
and
cause
the
reinstatement
of
a
conviction
or
possibly
even
a
second
trial.
the
appeal
entailed,
it
seems
to
me,
precisely
the
same
degree
of
ordeal
and
anxiety
and
expense
as
the
appeal
that
would
be
entailed
in
this
case,
and
yet
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
not
offended.
what
is
offended
by
an
appeal,
if
anything,
is
the
relief
that
the
government
requests.
that
is,
let's
say,
a
new
trial
following
an
acquittal.
of
course,
if
the
government
is
requesting
relief
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
have,
then
there
would
be
no
case
or
controversy
before
the
appellate
court.
but
it
is
the
relief
itself
and
not
the
appeal.
the
appeal
is
not
a
second
jeopardy
that
the
constitution
bars.
now,
before
i
talk
about
the
finality
question
as
to
whether
a
sentence
is
like
an
acquittal,
let
me
briefly
turn
to
the
question
of
multiple
punishment.
i
have--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--as
far
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
concerned,
leaving
aside
due
process
considerations
of
double
jeopardy--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
there
may
be
special
fairness
problems
that
are
involved
with
the
death
penalty.
i
think
the
kinds
of
problems
that
justice
stewart
adverted
to
earlier
might
be
a
particular
problem
where
you're
dealing
with
the
death
penalty,
but
i
think
as
far
as
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
concerned,
if
you're
talking
about
legal
error,
i
think
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
would
not
bar
the
appeal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it
would
be...
yes,
it
has,
certainly,
and
of
course
that
was
what
was
involved
in
the
stroud
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
constitution
otherwise
would
permit--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
haven't
thought
about
that.
now,
the
proposition
that
allowing
a
government
appeal
of
a
sentence
which
may
increase
a
sentence
constitutes
multiple
punishment
is
one
that
i
have
thought
about
in
preparing
my
argument.
and
i
have
to
admit
that
i
simply
don't
understand
it.
the
government
appeal
in
this
case
raises
the
question
of
the
proper
single
punishment
for
respondent's
offense.
the
issue
is
not
at
all
like
the
issue
in
cases
like
whalen
or
jeffers
where
the
defendant
received
two
sentences
and
the
claim
was
that
there
was
only
one
offense.
it's
not
at
all
like
the
seminal
case
of
ex
parte
lange
where
the
defendant
received
two
sentences
when
only
one
was
permitted
by
the
statute,
and
in
addition
the
problem
that
was
involved
in
the
companion
case
in
north
carolina
against
pearce,
he
received
one
five-day
sentence
and
one
one-year
sentence,
although
the
statute
only
allowed
one
year.
now,
there
is,
of
course,
the
dictum
in
the
united
states
against
benz,
and
i
am
not
sure
how
to
explain
that
except
to
say
that
the
dictum
is
clearly
based
on
ex
parte
lange;
it
contains
no
independent
explanation
of
the
source
of
its
conclusion.
we
have
no
difficulty
with
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
multiple
punishment
problem
in
ex
parte
lange.
and,
of
course,
neither
benz
nor
ex
parte
lange
dealt
with
the
question
of
government
appeals
of
sentences,
but
they
both
dealt
with
the
question
of
the
trial
court
calling
the
defendant
back
and
changing
the
sentence.
now,
there
might
be
a
problem
with
the
trial
court
having
imposed
the
sentence
and
a
few
weeks
later
saying,
i've
changed
my
mind,
i'm
calling
you
back,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
that
we
have.
and
another
peculiarity
of
the
benz
issue
is
that
it
apparently
applies
only
if
the
defendant
has
begun
serving
his
sentence.
but
if
the
defendant
is
on
bail,
apparently
under
this
rule
his
sentence
can
be
increased.
now,
that
doesn't
make
very
much
sense
to
me,
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
requirement
that
he
be
given
credit
for
time
served.
and
of
course,
on
the
government's
appeal,
any
sentence
that's
imposed
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
under
simpson
against
rice
give
credit
for
the
time
served.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
it
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
begun
serving
his
sentence.
i
think
that
matter
was
a
judge-made
nonconstitutional
rule
dealing
with
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
call
somebody
back
for
resentencing.
and
of
course
congress
would
have
the
power
to
overrule
any
such
principle
as
long
as
it's
not
of
constitutional
dimensions.
now
then,
we
have
the
third
and
what
to
my
mind
is
probably
the
only
substantial
argument
that
can
be
made
in
support
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
that's
the
contention
that
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
constitutes
in
effect
an
implied
acquittal
of
any
higher
sentencing.
therefore
the
defendant's
interest
in
the
finality
of
that
sentence
would
be
comparable
to
his
interest
in
an
acquittal.
i
think
the
best
statement
of
this
position
is
justice
harlan's
dissent
in
north
carolina
against
pearce
on
this
point,
but
i
note
that
the
court
did
not
accept
that
position
and
i
further
note
that
the
position
would
not
necessarily
apply
to
government
appeals.
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
first
sentence
in
north
carolina
against
pearce
and
therefore
an
argument
could
have
been
made
and
was
made
by
justices
harlan
and
douglas
that
there
was
no
adequate
justification
for
depriving
the
defendant
of
what
he
had
acquired
at
the
first
trial,
which
was
a
ceiling
on
his
sentence.
now
here
we
are
talking
about
a
case
in
which
it's
the
government's
contention
that
there's
something
legally
wrong
with
the
sentence
that
was
initially
imposed
and
that
the
government
should
be
entitled
to
correct
it.
the
court
of
appeals'
contrary
decision
rests
on
a
mistaken
impression,
as
i've
said
before,
about
the
relationship
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
the
defendant's
finality
interests.
those
finality
interests
are
not
generally
protected
against
the
government
appeal
but
are
protected
only
where
the
relief
that
the
government
seeks
is
to
set
aside
an
acquittal
and
have
a
retrial.
this
point
can
be
made
clear
by
comparing
pearce
with
green.
in
green
there
was
an
implied
acquittal
of
a
greater
offense
and
the
prosecution
was
barred
from
retrying
the
defendant
for
that
offense.
in
pearce
there
was
arguably
an
implied
acquittal
of
a
greater
sentence
and
the
prosecution
was
not
barred.
similarly,
in
bozza
against
the
united
states,
the
court
held
that
the
correction
of
an
illegal
sentence
to
increase
it
to
minimum
legal
requirements
was
permissible
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
an
illegal
dismissal
or
acquittal
entered
by
the
judge
in
fong
foo
before
the
government
had
barely
begun
the
presentation
of
its
evidence
was
held
not
reviewable.
now,
what
this
suggests
is
that
there
is
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
a
recognized
and
substantial
difference
between
the
finality
interest
that
a
defendant
has
in
an
acquittal
and
the
finality
interest
that
a
defendant
has
in
his
sentence,
just
as
there
are
differences
for
due
process
purposes
between
the
kinds
of
procedures
that
must
be
afforded
to
a
defendant
at
trial
and
to
a
defendant
in
connection
with
sentencing.
i
think
i
should
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
all
right.
i
just
wanted
to
answer
justice
brennan's
inquiry.
there
would
not
be
a
requirement
for
findings
under
the
proposed
bill
unless
the
sentence
were
below
or
above
the
guidelines.
but
if
it
was
within
the
guidelines
there...
no
findings
would
be
required
and
it
would
be
unreviewable.
we're
talking
here
only
about
the
existence
of
a
legal
error.
if
there's
no
legal
error,
there
is
no
change
in
the
sentence
and
therefore
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
so
only
the
correction
of
erroneous
sentences
is
what's
at
stake
and
we
believe
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
preclude
that
for
the
reasons
given.
