so
you
are
sure
that
it
hasn't
passed
the
house.
justice
stewart
one
problem
that
bothers
me
is,
mr.
frey,
is
all
of
the
procedures
that...
some
of
them
perhaps
have
never
been
held
to
be
constitutionally
required;
others
at
least
implicitly
have...
that
attend
the
original
sentencing,
such
as
allocutions
and
probation
reports
and
so
on,
none
of
those
apparently
is
available
in
the
appellate
court.
justice
stewart
no,
but
it's
an
increased
sentence,
and--
justice
stewart
--what
everyone
calls
it,
and
i...
let's
accept
your
statement
that
it's
not
a
de
novo
sentencing
proceeding
but
it
could
be
an
increase
from
ten
years
to
30
years
and
it's--
justice
stewart
--when
one
thinks
that
a
sentence
generally
has
been
surrounded
by
all
sorts
of
procedures
in
the
trial
courts
such
as
presentence
investigation,
allocution,
the
demeanor
of
the
defendant
during
the
trial,
and
all
those
various
things--
justice
stewart
--and
rule
11,
which
incorporates
some
of
these
things.
none
of
these
is
available
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it?
justice
stewart
--would
be
in
the
record.
justice
stewart
and
that
would
be
a
legal
error.
justice
stewart
and
that
would
be
a
legal
error.
it
might
be
an
unconstitutional
legal
error.
justice
stewart
or,
normally,
i
would
have
given
you
a
very
light
sentence,
but
since
you
pleaded
"not
guilty"
and
insisted
on
a
trial
i'll
give
you
a
lot
heavier
one.
justice
stewart
--at
least
he
could
have
gotten
20;
that's
clear.
justice
stewart
--was
one
year--
justice
stewart
now
that
you've
been
interrupted,
mr.
frey,
i
notice
that
the
bracketed
material
on
the
bottom
of
the
second
paragraph
of
what
you
read
to
us
on
page
43
of
the
appendix,
you
say
that
that
phrase
was
printed
in
the
findings
but
a
line
had
been
drawn
through
it
by
hand.
justice
stewart
in
your
submission
the
bracketed
material
ineluctably
followed
from
what
he
said.
justice
stewart
and
since
on
the
other
hand
he
ultimately
determined
not
to
give
a
longer
sentence,
he
or
somebody
under
his
direction,
presumably,
scratched
that
out.
justice
stewart
so
it's...
here
it's
sort
of
ambiguous.
he
seemed
to
have
determined
it
but
he
didn't
with
the
obvious...
he
scratched
out
the
inevitable
conclusion
from
that
determination.
justice
stewart
and
you're...
it's
your
point
that
the
only
question
before
us
is,
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
appeal?
justice
stewart
nothing
as
to
the
merits
of
the
appeal?
justice
stewart
but
your
first
position
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
that's
not
a
matter
for
us
to
determine.
justice
stewart
he
works
for
the
department
of
justice,
doesn't
he?
he
did.
justice
stewart
well,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
in
addition
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
stewart
your
answer
is
confined
to
the
effect
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
stewart
the
appeal
might
violate
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
due
process
clause.
or
some
other
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
stewart
well,
none
of
this
really
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
presented
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
does
it?
justice
stewart
well,
just...
not
"okay".
yes
or
no?
justice
stewart
and
therefore,
that
the
question
is
not
presented
by
this
case--
justice
stewart
--and
therefore,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
ought
to
be
dismissed
as
improperly
granted?
justice
stewart
well,
that
would
be
the
merits,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
that
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
at
least
as
presented
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
justice
stewart
that
would
be
an
argument
that
you
should
make
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
whole
provision
of
3576
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
stewart
but
the
dissenting
opinion
said
that
the
statute
was
inapplicable.
justice
stewart
or
concurring
opinion;
right.
separate
opinion.
justice
stewart
which
is
really
your
question
three
in
your
brief.
justice
stewart
all
right.
justice
stewart
of
course,
mr.
nemoyer,
one
of
the
things
that
3576
authorizes
an
appellate
court
to
do
on
the
government's
appeal
is
to
remand
for
further
sentencing
proceedings
and
imposition
of
sentence
by
the
trial
court.
and
none
of
the
arguments
you
are
making
would
question
the
validity
of
that
provision
of
the
statute,
would
it?
justice
stewart
--itself
extending
the
sentence.
justice
stewart
almost
every
week
around
here.
justice
stewart
well,
if
there's
never
been
any
case,
then
surely
there's
no
controlling
precedent,
is
there?
justice
stewart
well,
you've
just
told
us
it's
never
arisen
before.
