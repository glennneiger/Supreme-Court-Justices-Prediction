mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
respondent,
eugene
difrancesco,
who
is
serving
ten
years
in
this
matter
in
atlanta.
first
i
might
in
response
to
the
remarks
of
mr.
frey
point
out
that
the
federal
parole
board
now
has
a
severity
index
scale
which
they
apply
nationwide,
which
i
submit
is
a
much
better
way
to
even
sentences
out.
now--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--well,
his
first
point,
as
i
understood
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
there's
a
disparity
in
sentences.
he
said
the
public
is
complaining
about
it,
it's
one
of--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--i
misunderstood
him
then,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
any
respect,
i
think
there
is
now
a
procedure
to
even
out
sentences
without
an
appellate
review
which
has
a
lot
of
problems
in
it.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
that's
true,
judge.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
it's
a
regular
scale,
justice
white,
and
they
take
the
offense
plus
other
factors,
recidivism,
and
come
out
with
a
scale--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--the
united
states
parole
board
nationwide
has
a
system
by
which
they
address
sentences
of
all
people
in
the
federal
parole
system,
justice
white.
justice
white,
i
might
mention--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--no.
no,
this
is
what
happens
to
a
prisoner
after
he
is
incarcerated
and
it's
a
leveling
nationwide.
what
they
seek
would
only
be
a
leveling
circuitwide.
now,
mr.
frey
has
made
reference
to
the
senate
version--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--that's
true.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
i
believe
that
they're
talking--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--part
of...
yes,
judge.
no
question
about
it.
but
i
think
what
they're
complaining
about,
i
think,
judge,
in
the
final
analysis
is
they're
complaining,
occasionally
there's
too
lenient
a
sentence
imposed
by
some
judge
and
they
want
the
right
to
appeal
it.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
ignoring
the
statute
or
they
say...
for
example,
they
think
judge
burke
ignored
mr.
difrancesco's
background.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
i'm
referring
to
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
that's
true,
that's
true.
and
in
that
respect,
in
the
first...
yes,
you're
right,
mr.
rehnquist.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
right.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
it...
i
don't
want
to...
you're
probably
right
and
it's
just
going
by
me.
i
think
they're
claiming
that
in
the
particular
instance
they
think
the
defendant
got
too
lenient
a
sentence.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
under
the
statute.
for
example...
well,
two
things.
one,
earlier,
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
about
the
present
status
in
the
house.
as
i
understand
it
the
house
version
is
contrary
to
what
the
department
of
justice
seeks;
the
senate
version
does
favor
them,
and
maybe
that's
what
mr.
frey
meant
when
he
said
there
will
be
a
conference.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no;
none
at
all.
now,
he
also
read
at
length,
sir,
from
the
findings
he
said
that
judge
burke
made.
what
those
are,
justice
white,
were
their
findings
they
submitted
to
judge
burke.
he
signed
them,
striking
the
last
four
lines
out.
so
when
he
reads
that
he's
reading,
in
effect,
what
they
prepared
below,
which
judge
burke
signed,
striking
out,
i
think,
the
most
significant
thing,
namely,
that
the
defendant
should
be
incarcerated
for
a
longer
period
than
provided
for
by
the
underlying
felony.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
they're
not.
they're
theirs.
they
submitted
those
to
judge
burke
and
he
signed
them.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
judge,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
might
be
more
illuminating,
in
which
they
went
into
all
of
that
stuff,
and
i
think
judge
marshall
was
alluding
to
it.
judge
burke
said
there's
nothing
new
here
that
i
have
learned
today
except
the
defendant's
birthday.
and
the
part
about
the
murder,
your
honor,
which
is
the
only
one
involving
physical
violence,
mr.
shanahan...
and
it's
the
only
thing
he
said
at
the
hearing,
was
that
that
was
dismissed;
not
only
reversed,
it
was
dismissed
because
it
was
based
on
perjured
testimony.
the
hearing
below,
mr.
chief
justice,
consisted
strictly
of
mr.
baldwin
making
statements.
there
was
no
testimony,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out.
there
were
no
witnesses
and
the
defendant
said
very
little...
or
the
defendant's
lawyer,
mr.
shanahan,
because
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
judge
burke
gave
a
very
good
indication
of
his
feeling
when
he
interrupted
and
said,
about
the
only
thing
new
that
i
have
learned
here
today
is
the
defendant's
birthday.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
i'm
suggesting
to
the
judge
that...
one,
the
judge
knew
mr.
difrancesco
very
well,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
had
him
in
front
of
him
several
years
before,
in
which
he
sentenced
him,
and
again
it
was
to
less
than
the
maximum.
he
well
knew...
for
example,
the
columbus
day
bombings,
which
really
sound
horrendous
here,
were
nothing
more...
well,
i
don't
want
to
make
it
that
light
but
they
were
explosives
placed
outside
of
buildings
that
did
very
little
damage,
no
one
was
hurt.
in
all
the
arsons
that
they
allude
to,
judge,
no
one
was
hurt.
the
only
time
that
anyone
was--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--no,
judge.
but
i
only
mention
that
in
passing.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
the
last
four
lines,
judge.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
yes,
judge.
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
just
at
the
very
end.
what
i
submit...
and
it's
hard
to
tell
at
this
point,
but
i
think
all
these
were,
i
know
that
they
were
the
submitted
findings
from
the
department
to
judge
burke.
what
i
submit
to
this
court
is
that
judge
burke,
who
is
in
his
80s
and
does
not
have
a
clerk,
looked
at
those
findings,
placated
the
government
by
signing
them,
struck
out
the
only
part
that
really
mattered...
namely,
that
"the
defendant
has
to
be
incarcerated
for
a
longer
period
than
required
by
the
underlying
felony.
"
in
fact,
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
know,
it
might
be
like
a
medical
report
where
you
don't
read
it
all,
you
read
the
last
paragraph,
because
that
sets
it
out.
and
i
submit
that
judge
burke
well
could
have
found,
as
he
indicated
at
the
hearing,
that
he
knows
mr.
difrancesco,
he
knew
the
community,
he
heard
the
witnesses,
he
was
well
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
criminal
activity,
and
that
he
struck
out--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--i
think
it
might
not,
taken
out
of
context,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
if
he
thoughtfully...
and
we
knew
that
he
thoughtfully
considered
that,
that
is
one
thing.
but
i
submit
two
things:
one,
he
struck
out
the
last
part
of
the
findings;
and
two,
i
think
the
clearest
evidence
of
judge
burke's
disposition
was
this
sentence
that
he
imposed,
which
was
clearly
less
than
provided
for
the
underlying
felonies.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
well;
okay.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
i'm
sorry,
judge,
i'm
just
trying
to
reflect
that,
justice
stewart
and...
forgive
me.
but
i
think,
two,
i
think
it
does
two
ways.
one,
it
does
for
mr.
difrancesco
because,
first,
justice
stewart,
we
claim
that
we
shouldn't
be
here.
we
claim
that
we
were
never
properly
adjudged
a
special
dangerous
offender
as
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
right.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
right.
that's
our
first
position.
and
i
might
say,
in
the
same
vein,
justice
stewart,
our
second
position
was
that
the
underlying
felonies
carry
at
least
20
years,
25
years
under
3575,
and
40
years
under,
i
think,
the
general
consensus,
which
was
an
ample
sentence
if
judge
burke
chose
to
impose
it,
and
he
didn't.
and
if
there
was
40
years
provided
below,
that
this
3575
and
3576
had
no
office
to
perform,
as
judge
haight
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
below.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
right.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
it
was
our
position,
first,
that
we
lost
the--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--well,
justice
stewart,
you're
correct
that
if
i
am
not
prevailing
on
either
of
those
arguments,
then
i
have
to
go
to
the
merits,
and
the
merits
are
then,
first
of
all,
the
double
jeopardy
argument.
now,
it's
our
position,
flatly,
that
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
a
person
from
being
twice
placed
in
jeopardy.
it's
our
position
that
from
the
commencement
of
the
trial
up
until
the
time
of
sentencing
that
the
defendant
is
in
jeopardy.
in
fact,
justice
stewart,
it's
my
position,
that
jeopardy
is
most
acute
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
that's
when
he
faces
the
judge
and
he
is
going
to
be
told
what
the
outcome
is,
that
it's
the
climax
of
jeopardy,
if
you
would.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
i
don't,
justice
rehnquist.
but
that's
extraordinary
circumstances,
and
i
think,
by
and
large,
you're
entitled
to
have
your
matter
tried
and
finished
by
one
tribunal,
absent
a
circumstance
of
death
or
ill
health;
or
something
of
that.
but
under
that
circumstance,
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
judge,
i
didn't
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
my
partner
argued.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
i
don't
know.
i
believe
my
partner
did
not
argue
that,
judge.
it
was
in
the
brief
but
i
don't
know
that
he
argued
it.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
they
didn't.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
that's
correct.
they
went
directly
to
the
constitutional
issue
and
never
passed
on
that.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
yes,
justice
stewart.
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
haight.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
right.
said
that
it
had
no
office
to
perform
because
the
defendant
could
have
received
40
years
below.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
right;
that's
true.
but,
justice
white,
i
think
the
issue
was
never...
the
court
never
addressed
itself
to
that
issue.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
now,
justice
stewart's
point
about
the
right
of
allocution
and
appeal
to
the
2nd
circuit,
i
think,
is
a
real
problem
with
this
statute.
the
defendant
under
federal
rule
32(a)(1)
has
a
right
to
speak
at
sentence.
it
directs
that
the
court
address
him
personally
and
give
him
a
right
to
speak.
i
don't
see
how
under
this
statute
you
could...
you
could
get
around
that
by...
i
don't
see
the
analogy
to
an
argument,
a
legal
argument
on
appeal.
this
is,
i
submit,
a
sentence
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
that
there's
a
question
of
credibility,
a
question
of
rehabilitation,
many
questions,
and
that
a
cold
record
to
an
appellate
court
is
not
as
enlightening
as
the
trial
court
sitting,
seeing
the
defendant,
hearing
the
witnesses,
knowing
the
extent
of
the
damage;
and
in
sentencing
he
might
have
received
dozens
of
letters.
he'd
know
the
nature
of
the
person
that
sent
him
the
letter,
whether
it
should
be
given
great
consideration
or
no
consideration.
none
of
these
things,
i
submit,
would
be
by
and
large
available
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
judge
stewart,
no.
i'm
arguing
against
the
circuit
court
itself--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--modifying
by
increasing;
true.
now,
congress...
as,
justice
rehnquist,
you
pointed
out...
has
made
a
decision
in
this
area
and
they
say,
or
they
have
spoken.
but
congress,
i
submit,
sir,
changes
every
two
years.
our
constitution
has
been
in
force
for
189
years,
and
it
should
be
more
consistent.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
well--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--in
a
hundred
and...
this
is
the
first
time
ever
that--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--well,
this
is
the
first
time
ever
that
the
department
of
justice
has
sought
to
increase
a
sentence
on
appeal.
it's
never
been
done
before.
this
fifth
amendment's
been
in
effect
189
years--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--yes,
judge.
this
is
the
first
time--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--well,
as
far
as--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--no.
well,
yes,
it
does.
i
think
that
the
provision
of...
i
think
it's
a
clear...
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
is
clear
in
this
area,
that
they're
not
permitted
to
go
and
appeal
sentence,
to
twice
put
the
defendant
in
jeopardy.
and
i
think
it's
dead
clear,
and
i
submit
that's
why
it
has
never
been
attempted.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
i
think
there
is
no
controlling
precedent
right
on
point,
judge
stewart.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
what's
on
point
is
the
fifth
amendment
itself.
but
i
don't...
as
far
as
our
position,
and
i
think
their
position
is,
there
is
no
case.
mr.
frey
has
cited
many
cases,
judge,
but
none
of
them
stand
for
the
proposition
he
is
urging
this
court
to
sanction,
namely
the
right
of
the
government
to
seek
increased
sentence
on
appeal.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
that's
true;
that's
true.
and
he
cited
a
lot
of
cases,
but
none
of
them,
judge,
stand
for
what
he's
asking
here.
another
problem
i
see
with
it
is
if
you
permit
an
appellate
review
of
a
district
court
judge's
sentencing,
you
undercut
the
authority
and
stature
of
the
district
court
judge.
as
it
is
now,
when
he
sentences
it
has
a
degree
of
finality
to
it.
but
if
every
district
court
judge
in
imposing
sentence
then
has
his
sentence
subject
to
review
by
an
appellate
court,
i
think
it
somewhat
demeans
his
authority
and
stature.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
judge,
they
well
might
have
been,
and
when
congress
enacted
this
section
they
were
well
aware,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
had
constitutional
problems,
and
that
was
discussed
when
it
was
enacted.
and
i'm
saying
that
this
court
i
would
like
to
consider
these
factors.
congress
well
might
have
considered
them,
but
their
viewpoint
and
this
court's
viewpoint
might
not
necessarily
be
the
same,
for
some
of
the
reasons
we've
stated.
in
addition,
i
submit
that
permitting
in...
this
section
requires
the
court
of
appeals
to
put
in
writing,
the
act
of
congress
requires
the
court
of
appeals
to
put
in
writing
the
reason
for
their
disposition
of
sentencing.
i
submit,
judge,
i'm
troubled
with
an
act
of
congress
directing
the
court
to
do,
to
make
certain
written
findings,
appellate
court.
but
in
any
event,
judge,
i
submit
that
it
would
create
an
awesome
burden
to
our
appellate
courts
to,
one,
make
them
review
sentences
at
the
behest
of
the
government;
make
written
findings;
review
lengthy
presentence
reports;
maybe
make
some
provision
for
the
defendant
to
have
the
right
of
allocution;
review
maybe
dozens
of
letters
sent
on
his
behalf
and
other
sort
of
testaments.
i
think,
logistically,
it
would
be
a
tremendous
burden
to
impose
on
our
circuit
courts.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
this
is
the
first
one
that
i'm
aware
of
judge.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no,
but,
judge,
this...
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
limited
very
narrowly
to
a
special
dangerous
offender
section.
their
legislation,
mr.
frey
indicated,
that's
pending
now
would
give
them
this
right
across
the
board.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
i
think
mr.
justice
stevens
was
correct
in
that
it
would
even
apply
in
murder
cases.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
final
analysis
is
going
to
be
here,
judge.
in
forcing
district
court
judges
to
articulate
their
reasons
for
sentencing,
i
think
you
would
be
limiting
their
discretion.
and
i
submit
that
if
their
sentencing,
district
court
judges,
would
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court,
they
would
be
required
to
find
their
findings,
to
put
their
findings
in
writing,
or
there
would
be
no
other
practical
way
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
review
it.
and
in
so
doing
i
think
you
would
limit
their
discretion.
they
are
now
permitted
to
consider
many
factors,
even
factors
outside
of
a
presentence
report.
for
example,
the
defendant's
demeanor
in
a
courtroom,
maybe
his
demeanor
on
the
stand,
the
type
of
witnesses
he
presents;
many
factors.
by
permitting
the
government
to
appeal
sentences
you
would
force
the
district
court
judge
to
put
in
writing
the
reasons
for
his
findings,
which
i
submit
would
limit
his
discretion,
which
i
don't
think
would
be
a
good
thing.
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
no.
just...
i
think
that
would
be
the
outcome
of
permitting--
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
--no,
i
don't
know
that,
judge,
justice
brennan.
i
do
know
this
though,
justice
brennan,
that
this
legislation,
the
second
last
sentence
of
3576,
requires
the
court
of
appeals
to
put
in
writing
the
reason
for
their
disposition
of
sentence.
my
position,
justice
brennan,
would
be
that
the
district
court
judge,
if
he
knew
his
sentence
was
going
to
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court,
would
have
to
put
his
reasons
in
writing
because
there'd
be
no
other
way
that
you
could
have
a
practical
review.
if
it
wasn't
in
writing
the
appellate
court
would
not
know
the
reasons.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
question
of
the
government
whether
this
was
a
final
sentence.
i
think
it
is
a
final
sentence.
the
statute
does
not
talk
about
tentative
sentences.
the
statute
says,
"shall
sentence".
mr.
edgar
c.
nemoyer
well,
i
think
in
all
senses
this
sentence
was
final.
the
statute
says,
"the
court
shall
sentence
the
defendant
to
imprisonment
for
an
appropriate
term.
"
mr.
difrancesco
was
sentenced
and
he
is
serving,
pursuant
to
that
sentence,
at
this
time.
our
position
is,
very
strongly,
sir,
that
it
is
a
final
sentence.
because
the
department
of
justice
very
much
has
said
in
their
argument
that
if
this
was
a
tentative
sentence,
then
it's
not
double
jeopardy.
and
the
2nd
circuit
said,
that
well
may
be
but
that's
not
the
statute
before
us.
the
statute
before
us
is
what
we
consider,
and
in
this
statute
it's
not
a
tentative
sentence,
it's
a
final
sentence.
and
they
well
might
come
up
with
some
other
statute
that
this
court
will
have
to
consider,
which
may
not
be
unconstitutional,
but
i
submit,
sir,
this
one
is.
because
it
is
a
final
sentence,
subject
to
review
and
a
sentence
again.
well,
in
closing,
two
things.
the
government
has
pointed
out
an
article
that
favors
their
position
in
the
american
criminal
law
journal.
there's
an
article
immediately
following
it,
united
states-difrancesco,
which
they
have
not
made
reference
to
in
their
brief.
it
very
much
favors
our
position.
it's
mr.
george
freeman.
i
believe
he's
justice
black's...
former
justice
black's
clerk.
in
summary,
i
think
this
would
be
a
tremendous
price
to
pay,
namely,
giving
the
government
the
right
to
appeal
sentences.
it
would
subject
all
defendants
to
an
apprehension
regarding
their
sentences.
they
well
might
have
pled
guilty
to
avoid
that
apprehension,
or
they
might
not
have
the
funds
to
go
on
appeal.
it
would
subject
all
trial
judges,
their
decisions
regarding
sentencing,
to
review.
it
would
subject
the
circuit
courts
to
making
findings.
and
if
somebody
disagreed
with
those
findings,
there's
only
one
place
they
could
come,
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
be
doing,
reviewing
the
sentences.
and
i
think
that
the
only
thing
it
really
prevents
is
an
occasional
too
lenient
a
sentence
of
a
defendant
and
i
submit
that
it's
an
extremely
large
price
to
pay
for
that
small
mischief;
that
the
bill
of
rights
should
protect
the
defendant.
