chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
secretary
of
interior
v.
the
surface
mining
company
and
the
related
case.
mr.
buscemi.
chief
justice
burger
then,
do
you
think
that
congress
after
reciting
the
history
of
surface
farm
lands
in
oklahoma
being
blown
over
into
kansas
and
other
places,
back
in
the
'30s,
could
require
under
the
commerce
clause
that
all
farmers
plough
their
land
with
contour
plowing
as
distinguished
from
straight
line
plowing?
chief
justice
burger
my
question
gives
you
a
concrete,
specific
statute,
though.
chief
justice
burger
well,
assuming...
add
to
it
the
congressional
recital
that
scientific
research
and
practice
has
demonstrated
that
contour
plowing
will
preserve
the
soil
for
future
generations.
chief
justice
burger
well,
but
they've
done
that
by
use
of
the
power
of
the
purse,
granting
subsidies
if
farmers
complied
with
certain
regulations.
i'm
talking
about
a
flat
requirement
that
all
farmers
on
certain
findings
engage
in
contour
plowing.
do
you
think
they
might
be
able
to
do
it?
chief
justice
burger
the
word
necessary
presupposes
the
answer
a
little
bit,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
the
basis
would
be
that
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
says
it
knows
more
about
farming
and
soil
conservation
than
the
states
do,
and
congress
accepts
that.
chief
justice
burger
can
you
give
us
an
example
or
two
of
what
would
be
the
negative
impact
on
commerce?
flush
that
out
a
little.
chief
justice
burger
well,
because
congress
says
so
doesn't
make
it
true,
necessarily.
i'm
asking
you
for
illustrations,
concrete
illustrations,
as
to
what
you
think
congress
was
driving
at.
chief
justice
burger
that's
not
a
commerce
clause
issue,
is
it?
the
loss
of
lives?
chief
justice
burger
there
was
something
about
powers
not
expressly
granted
having
been
reserved,
isn't
there
somewhere?
chief
justice
burger
well,
we've
been
trying,
i
think,
several
of
us
to
get
a
specific
focus
on
just
how
it
affects
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
rights
at
that
time,
they
were
not
granted
to
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
do
you
wish
to
exercise
that
as
rebuttal
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
this
case
is
submitted.
