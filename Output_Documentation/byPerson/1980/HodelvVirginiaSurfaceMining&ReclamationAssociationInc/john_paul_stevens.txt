justice
stevens
well,
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
general
practice
for
mines
as
a
whole
of
requiring
the
restoration
of
the
slope
does
in
fact
have
some
impact
on
commerce
by
preventing
the
various
things
that
congress
found,
such
as
erosion
and
floods
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
do
you
take
that
position?
justice
stevens
or
are
you
taking
the
more
extreme
position
that
you
don't
even
have
to
have
that
as
long
as
the
activity
is
regulated,
is
subject
to
regulation?
justice
stevens
what
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
then,
is,
is
that
some
of
the
things
that
you
read
are
in
fact,
looking
at
the
class
of
activity
as
a
whole,
related
to
commerce.
justice
stevens
which
is
different
from
the...
all
right.
justice
stevens
i
think
that's
a
different
argument.
a
minute
ago
you
said
there
was
plenty
of
power
in
the
federal
government,
but
there's
an
independent
curtailment
of
the
exercise
of
that
power.
justice
stevens
if
there
weren't
this
independent
doctrine
that
you
could
identify
for
us,
there
would
be
ample
federal
power,
you
don't
concede,
under
the
district
court's
reasoning--
justice
stevens
--arguendo,
you
say?
arguendo.
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
just
ask,
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
contention,
supposing
congress
expressly
found
that
the
failure
to
restore
the
slope
to
the
original
contour
would
result
in
numerous
floods
of
interstate
waterways.
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
would
you
say
the
doctrine
you
describe
would
prevent
congress
from
enacting
the
statute
based
on
such
a
finding?
justice
stevens
no,
but
assume
that
there
was
adequate
support
for
such
a
finding.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
legal
position
you're
taking.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
this
law
would
still
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
because
you
say
that
requiring
the
restoration
of
the
slopes
is
intrusive
of
some
inherent
state
power?
justice
stevens
one
other
question,
mr.
attorney
general.
the
virginia
steep
slope
provision,
unlike
the
indiana
case,
where
there's
a
farmland,
has
a
variance
authorization
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
if
in
fact
the
statute
were
administered
in
a
way
that
frequently
resulted
in
variances
in
this
part
of
the
country
where
steep
slopes
are
so
common,
would
it
still
have
the
same
impact,
or
are
we
perhaps
getting
to
this
question
before
we
have
to,
until
we
know
how
often
the?
justice
stevens
i
must
have
misunderstood.
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
authority
for...
a
variance
would
not
relieve
the
miner
of
the
obligation
to
restore
to
the
original
contour?
justice
stevens
this
argument,
would
you
just
respond
to
this
for
me,
because
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled.
his
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
slopes
are
so
steep
that
if
you
pile
the
stuff
back
up
against
the
wall
there's
no
room
for
a
bench.
justice
stevens
but
didn't
the
district
court
findings
support
what
he
says?
justice
stevens
it's
been
done
in
ohio
and
pennsylvania,
and
presumably
the
mountains
there
are
just
as
steep
as
they
are?
