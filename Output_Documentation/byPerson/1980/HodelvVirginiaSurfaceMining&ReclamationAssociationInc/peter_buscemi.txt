mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
like
the
one
that
follows
it,
involves
several
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
surface
mining
control
and
reclamation
act
of
1977.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
virginia.
the
original
plaintiffs
were
an
association
of
coal
mining
companies
and
63
of
its
members.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
in
the
district
court.
the
primary
constitutional
provisions
involved
are
the
commerce
clause,
article
i,
section
8;
the
tenth
amendment;
and
the
just
compensation
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
plan
to
address
the
constitutional
questions
in
that
order
after
i
first
describe
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
at
issue
here
in
the
overall
statutory
scheme
for
regulating
surface
mining
of
coal.
for
present
purposes
the
critical
portion
of
the
statute
is
title
v
which
is
entitled,
"control
of
environmental
impacts
of
surface
coal
mining.
"
section
501
of
the
act
establishes
a
two-stage
program
for
the
regulation
of
surface
mining.
during
the
initial
stage,
also
called
the
interim
stage
in
the
secretary's
regulations,
mine
operators
are
required
to
comply
with
only
some
of
the
performance
standards
set
up
by
the
act.
among
the
ones
applicable
during
this
interim
stage
are
the
so-called
steep
slope
provisions
in
section
515(d).
they
apply
to
surface
mining
on
slopes
greater
than
20
degrees.
they
require
mine
operators
to
avoid
the
placement
of
debris,
spoil
material,
or
abandoned
equipment
on
the
downslope
beneath
the
mining
cut.
they
further
require
restoration
of
the
mining
site
to
its
approximate
original
contour
after
mining
is
completed,
and
complete
coverage
of
the
so-called
high
wall,
which
is
the
vertical
face
of
the
mine
cut.
another
portion
of
the
act
that
becomes
immediately
effective
during
the
interim
period
is
section
522(e),
particularly
522(e)(4)
and
(5),
which
with
various
qualifications
and
exceptions
prohibit
surface
mining
altogether
within
specified
distances
of
roads,
schools,
churches,
parks,
public
buildings,
and
cemeteries.
during
the
interim
period
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
primarily
responsible
for
enforcing
the
act.
the
interim
regulatory
program
remains
in
effect
in
each
state
until
a
permanent
program
has
been
established
in
that
state.
states
wishing
to
assume
primary
responsibility
for
regulation
of
surface
coal
mining
during
the
permanent
phase
must
submit
to
the
secretary
a
proposed
permanent
program
demonstrating,
first,
that
the
state
legislature
has
adopted
the
necessary
laws
implementing
the
environmental
protection
standards
established
by
the
act.
and
second,
that
the
state
has
the
administrative
and
the
technological
capability
to
enforce
those
standards.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
completely
appreciate
the
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
factual
underpinning
that
congress
would
have
for
that
sort
of
regulation.
my
answer
to
that
question
and
hypotheticals
of
that
kind
is
essentially
that
if
congress
finds,
and
has
a
rational
basis
for
finding,
that
a
particular
situation
that
exists
in
the
states
is
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
if
congress
devises
a
method
that's
rationally
related
to
the
protection
of
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
the
statute
is
constitutional.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
justification
would
be
for
the
statute
that
you've
just
suggested,
but
i
think
that
the
test
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
court's
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
v.
usery
establishes
that
there
is
some
impact
of
the
federal
system
of
government,
our
state
system,
the
tenth
amendment,
or
the
federal
system
of
government
generally,
however
you
want
to
characterize
that
decision,
on
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power.
and
so
i
don't
think
that
mr.
chief
justice
hughes'
statement
that
you've
just
read
can
be
completely
disavowed.
we
don't
take
that
position
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
again,
my
answer
to
that
question
is
essentially
the
same
as
it
was
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
have
to
confess
ignorance
as
to
the
situation
in
the
dust
bowl
in
the
'30s,
and
as
to
the
impact
of
contour
plowing
as
opposed
to
some
other
kind
of
plowing--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
congress
rationally
found
that
the
failure
to
adopt
a
particular
method
of
plowing
or
a
particular
method
of
cultivating
farmlands
had
an
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
if
congress
further
rationally
concluded
that
regulation
of
the
method
of
plowing
would
help
to
alleviate
that
effect,
that
congress
could
regulate
that
sort
of
agricultural
activity,
just
as
congress
has
in
fact
regulated
agricultural
cultivation,
for
example,
with
the
pricing
regulations
and
also
with
the
farm
subsidy
laws.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
findings
are
critical.
that
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
so
lightly
assumed
in
the
hypothetical,
because
congress
here,
in
the
surface
mining
act,
as
it
has
in
the
other
commerce
clause
legislation
that
the
court
has
sustained,
has
very
carefully
examined
exactly
the
situation
that
did
prevail
and
has
determined
that
particular
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce
did
exist.
and
i
think
that
if
you
are
willing
to
assume
that
congress
has
made
all
the
necessary
findings
and
congress
has
determined
that
there
is
a
rational
relationship
between--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
essentially
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
once
you
make
that
assumption
you
are
presupposing
the
answer.
the
question
really
is,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
congressional
action,
and
that's
something
that,
you
know,
we
can
only
talk
about
in
connection--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--but,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
have
a
very
careful,
detailed,
lengthy
investigation
by
congress
into
surface
mining
and
its
adverse
effects
on
commerce,
and
we
have
the
legislative
history
that
we've
set
out
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
in
this
case
which
demonstrates,
i
think,
that
congress
has
taken
a
very
close
look
at
surface
mining
and
its
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
and
i
don't--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think
in
particular
the
high
wall
regulation
that
you,
or
the
high
wall
statutory
provision
that
you
refer
to
is
very
closely
connected
to
preventing
adverse
environmental
effects
from
surface
mining.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
kinds
of
effects
on
commerce
that
congress
can
consider,
and
i
think
that
in
this
case
that
congress
has
found
that
there
is
substantial
environmental
damage
caused
by
surface
mining.
mr.
peter
buscemi
subject,
of
course,
to
the
test
that
it
would
have
to
bear
a
rational
relationship.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
understand,
mr.
justice
white,
but
in
point
of
fact,
in
this
statute,
under
section
615,
it
is
permissible
to
flatten
the
land.
the
mountaintop
removal
method
is
specifically
authorized
by
the
statute
so
that
congress
has
not
prevented
that
sort
of
activity.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
correct.
they
can
use
the
mountaintop
removal
method
of
mining
which
essentially
slices
off
the
peak
of
the
mountain
rather
than
gouging
out
strips
along
the
side
of
the
mountain.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i'm
not
sure
specifically
what
you
mean
by
flattening
it
and
covering
it,
but
in
fact,
again
with
respect
to
the
strip
mining,
the
surface
mining
on
the
side
of
the
mountain,
the
steep
slope
provisions
do
provide
variances
that
will
allow
the
maintenance
of
flat
benchland
if
that
is
necessary
for
public
use
or
a
higher
economic
use.
mr.
peter
buscemi
what
the
effect
on
commerce
is
of
strip
mining?
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
refer
you
to
the
findings
that
congress
made
in
section
101
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
precisely
my
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
section
101
of
the
statute
contains
congress's
findings
with
respect
to
the
environmental
impact
that
surface
mining
has.
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
section
101
of
the
statute
congress
has
found
that
coal
mining
operations
contribute
significantly
to
the
nation's
energy
requirements,
that
surface
mining
results
in
disturbance
of
surface
areas,
that
burden
and
adversely
affect
commerce
by
destroying
and
diminishing
the
utility
of
land
for
commercial,
industrial,
residential,
recreational,
agricultural,
and
forestry
purposes
by
causing
erosion
and
landslides,
by
contributing
to
floods,
by
polluting
the
water,
by
destroying
fish
and
wildlife
habitats,
by
impairing
natural
beauty,
by
damaging
the
property
of
citizens,
by
creating
hazards
dangerous
to
life
and
property--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
the
question
is
not
whether
every
individual
failure
to
restore
a
particular
surface
mine
to
its
approximate
original
contour
has
a
substantial
effect
on
commerce.
rather,
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
regulate
this
entire
activity
that
has
a
substantial
effect
on
commerce.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
can
point
to
a
particular
mine
and
identify
the
particular
effect
on
commerce
from
that
mine.
that
is
certainly
correct.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
form
of
regulation
that
congress
chooses,
there
must
be
a
rational
relationship
between
that
regulation
and
the
protection
and
the
regulation
of
commerce.
i
don't
think
congress
is
free
to
say
surface
mining
is
subject
to
regulation--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
now,
i
want
to
make
the
point--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
really
don't
know
how
to
respond
to
that
except
by
saying
that
the
list
that
i
just
read,
i
think,
indicates
that
there
is
a
substantial
effect
on
commerce.
certainly--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
example,
the
buffalo
creek
flood
disaster,
which
we've
cited
or
mentioned
in
one
of
the
briefs
and
which
is
mentioned
in
the
congressional
reports,
is
the
kind
of
disaster
that
congress
is
trying
to
avert
through
regulating
surface
mining,
and
i
think
that
where
hundreds
of
lives
are
lost,
there's
no
question
of
the--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
think,
for
example,
that
if
you
look
at
the
child
labor
legislation
that
this
court
upheld
under
the
commerce
clause
in
darby,
there's
no
question
that
congress
can
try
to
pursue
other
ends
in
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
clause
power.
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
as
far
as
i
can
understand
their
argument,
plaintiffs
don't
disagree
with
any
of
what
we've
been
saying
so
far.
their
point
is
that
the
surface
mining
act
affects
land
use
and
land
use
is
something
that
is
committed
exclusively
by
the
constitution
to
the
states,
and
that
that's
why
this
statute
exceeds
the
commerce
clause.
and
they
cite
this
court
to
the
decision
in
mccready
v.
virginia
in
1877,
and
they
talk
about
the
separation
of
production
and
commerce.
but,
as
the
court
held
in
darby
and
in
jones
&
laughlin
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to,
and
in
wickard
v.
filburn,
and
brightwood
dairy
and
a
host
of
other
cases,
that
the
rigid
separation
of
production
and
commerce
is
no
longer
the
rule
that's
followed
by
this
court.
mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that,
for
example,
in
your
dissent
in
this
court
in
fry
v.
united
states,
you
make
the
point
that
there
is
a
very
broad
discretion
in
congress
to
make
findings,
and
that's
part
of
what
congress
is
entitled
to
do,
and
you
made
that
point,
i
believe,
in
the
connection
of
united
states
v.
california,
which
you
specifically
said
you
thought
was
a
correct
decision
because
congress
had
made
certain
findings
about
the
impact
of
railroad
hazards
on
public
safety
and
on
commerce.
it
is
true
that
congress
does
have
an
extremely
broad
factfinding
capability
and
discretion,
but
i
don't...
that
does
not
mean
that
there
is
no
review
whatsoever.
there
must
be
a
rational
basis
for
a
factual
finding
that
congress
has
made,
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
record
in
this
case,
which
includes
volumes
and
volumes
of
hearings
and
evidence
of
the
negative
effects
that
surface
mining
has
had,
demonstrates
that
there
is
a
basis
for
the
congressional
findings.
now,
there
are,
by
the
way,
a
number
of
federal
statutes
that
affect
land
use.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
about
that,
and
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
district
court
and
what
appellees
mean
when
they
say
that
congress
is
not
free
to
effect
land
use,
because,
for
example,
the
clean
air
act
and
the
clean
water
act,
the
historical
preservation
statutes
in
the
federal
code
that
we
discussed
in
the
grand
central
station
brief,
the
wild
and
scenic
rivers
act,
a
number
of
these
statutes
have
effects
on
land
use,
and
plaintiffs,
i
don't
believe,
contend
that
all
of
those
statutes
go
beyond
the
commerce
clause.
there's
nothing
about
the
phrase
"land
use"
that's
sacrosanct
under
the
constitution.
i
mean,
the
constitution
does
not
say
that
states
are
the
only
governmental
entities
entitled
to
regulate
land
use.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
here
the
commerce
clause
power
is
expressly
granted.
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
i've
given
my
best
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
that
congress
has
found
that
it
affects
interstate
commerce
in
several
ways
and
i
think
that
those
findings
are
rational
findings
and
they're
supported
by
the
evidence
in
the
legislative
record,
in
the
committee
reports,
in
the
hearings,
and
so
on.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
even
the
record
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
provides
several
examples
of...
the
district
court's
own
opinion
says
that
in
the
absence
of
this
legislation,
or
if
this
legislation
is
invalidated,
there
will
be
negative
consequences,
not
only
for
coal
mining
itself,
but
also
for
the
safety
and
the
health
of
the
people
in
mining
communities.
now,
of
course--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
exactly
right.
that's
exactly
the
point
i
was
just
about
to
make,
because
from
this
point--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--the
district
court
ruled
in
our
favor.
that's
not
true
in
the
indiana
case,
but
the
district
court
here
sustained
the
statute
on
the
commerce
clause
ground.
now,
admittedly,
this
commerce
clause-tenth
amendment
or
federal
system
argument
emerges
to
some
extent
in...
this
court
in
national
league
of
cities
said
that
the
statute
there
was
unquestionably
valid
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
that
the
tenth
amendment
or
the
state-federal
relationship
in
our
constitutional
system
imposed
some
limitations
on
congress's
power
to
exercise
the
commerce
clause
delegated
power.
so
that
that
was...
even
in
national
league
of
cities
there
was
no
question
that
the
commerce
clause
power
alone
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
congressional
action.
the
question
is
whether
there
was
some
additional
limit.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
first
point
on
which
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
secretary,
and
that
is
on
this
tenth
amendment
argument.
but
this
statute
is
far
different
from
the
one
that
the
court
considered
in
national
league
of
cities,
and
the
reaffirmation
of
the
decision
in
united
states
v.
california,
in
national
league
of
cities,
i
think
is
very
instructive
because
there,
in
california,
we
had
a
federal
statute
that
was
being
applied
directly
to
the
states.
this
statute
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states
in
any
way.
this
statute
applies
only
to
coal
mine
operators.
the
federal
government
does
not
require
the
states
to
undertake
any
measures
whatsoever.
if
the
states
do
not
wish
to
participate
in
the
regulatory
program
that
the
federal
statute
establishes,
they
need
not
do
so.
if
they
wish
to
do
so,
they
can
submit
a
proposed
program
to
the
secretary
and...
by
the
way,
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
discretion
left
to
the
states
in
those
proposed
programs.
in
fact,
in
section
101(f)
of
the
act
congress
itself
stated
that
because
of
the
diversity
in
terrain
and
climate,
chemical
and
other
physical
conditions,
the
primary
governmental
responsibility
should
rest
with
the
states.
that
was
congress'
whole
plan
under
this
statute.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
reviewing
a
request
for
preliminary
injunction
in
the
rule,
the
regulation
review
proceeding
that's
going
on
there
right
now,
denied
the
preliminary
injunction
and
in
an
opinion
by
the
court...
the
panel
included
judge
tamm,
judge
mckinnon,
and
district
judge
greene...
announced
that
this
statute
was
truly
an
exemplary
piece
of
federalist
legislation
because
of
the
interaction
between
the
state
and
the
federal
governments.
and
i
think
that
congress
has
tried
to
strike
the
balance
in
a
fair
way
here
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
without
requiring
the
states
to
do
anything.
the
states
may...
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
leeway
in
framing
these
proposed
permanent
programs,
and
several
of
those
proposed
programs
have
already
been
approved,
including
one
by
the
state
of
west
virginia.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
a
state,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
free
to
decide
that
it
will
not
regulate
surface
mining
at
all,
but
in
that
event
the
federal
government
will
regulate
surface
mining.
mr.
peter
buscemi
under
the
commerce
clause.
that's
correct.
and
my
only
point,
at
this
stage,
is
that
the
tenth
amendment
does
not
restrict
the
congressional
decision
to
do
that
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
national
league
of
cities,
there
is
nothing
in
the
tenth
amendment
that
prohibits
regulation
of
individual
entrepreneurs
in
private
business.
that
distinction
was
expressly
preserved.
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
at
this
point,
and
i
think
i
will
address
the
taking
questions
in
connection
with
the
indiana
case,
since
they
are
exactly
the
same.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
couple
of
things
in
connection
with
this
tenth
amendment
commerce
clause
argument.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
zoning
statute
in
the
way
that
expression
is
ordinarily
used.
this
is
not
an
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
change
the
communities'
maps
in
the
state
of
virginia.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
is
in
the
next
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
will
say
that,
again,
there
is
nothing
in
the
prime
farmland
regulations
that
attempts
to
tell
a
local
community
how
to
use
its
land
or
what
areas
are
to
be
used
for
residential
purposes
or
commercial
purpose
or
anything.
all
of
this
goes
only
to
surface
mining.
and
moreover
it's
not
a
prohibition
on
surface
mining.
it's
just
a
statutory
provision
that
says
that
if
you're
going
to
surface
mine,
you've
got
to
do
it
in
this
way,
and
you've
got
to
restore
the
land
so
you
don't
cause
damage.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
and
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
preserve
the
productive
capacity
of
the
farmland.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
bond,
the
full
amount
of
the
bond,
and
if
i
understand
section
519
of
the
act,
is
not
released
until
after
five
years,
but
60
percent
of
the
bond
is
released
in
a
much
shorter
time,
as
soon
as
the
approximate
original
contour
is
restored.
i
think
section
519
will
make
that
quite
clear.
and
moreover,
i
do
want
to
respond
to
this
business
about
covering
the
high
wall,
because
mr.
coleman--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--oh,
well,
the
consequence
is
that
there's
only
a
small
amount
of
the
bond
is
retained
for
that
full
five-year
period,
and
if
the
mine
operator
or
the
owner
of
the
land
believes
that
the
financial--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--oh,
within
the
five
years
the
owner
may
put
the
land
back
into
a
flattened
state
if
necessary,
if
he
wishes
to
do
so,
if
the
financial
rewards
are
as
great
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes.
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
perhaps,
mr.
justice
white,
by
sacrificing
part
of
the
bond.
but
this
is
how
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
connects
to
yours,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
is
nothing
in
the
variance
procedure
that
prohibits
the
covering
of
the
high
wall
and
still
leaving
of
a
substantial
amount
of
flat
benchland.
all
congress
was
trying
to
do
with
respect
to
covering
the
high
wall
is
to
prevent
the
open
vertical
face
from
still
showing.
once
there
is
land
that
is
placed
back
against
that
and
sloped
down
and
restabilized,
flat
benchland
can
still
be
left
and
still
comply
with
that.
now,
there's
no--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--oh,
benchland
is
the
horizontal
portion.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
word
bench
is
designed
to
indicate
that
it's
up
above,
it's
on
the
mountainside.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it's
the
horizontal
portion
of
the
cut
into
the
side
of
the
mountain.
when
the
mountain
started
out
it
was
just
one
straight
line
and
then
they
cut
out
at
the
corner,
as
they
go
around
the
mountain.
and
the
flat
part
is
called
a
bench.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
pictures,
for
example,
here
in
the
committee
reports,
you
will
see
that
it
has
been
done.
pennsylvania
and
ohio
have
both
had
statutes
requiring
this
similar
kind
of
restoration
and
it
is
practical,
and
congress
found
that
it
was
so.
mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
that
may
well
be
his
argument,
but
i
think
that
congress
has
found
that
that
is
not
so,
and
i
think
that
many
of
these
benches
are
wide
enough--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--the
district
court
also
said
that
compliance
with
the
approximate
original
contour
requirement
was
physically
impossible.
but
we
know
from
the
pictures
in
the
legislative
record
that
it's
not,
because
it's
been
done.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
the
state
of
west
virginia
has
had
no
problem
in
complying
with
this
statute.
they
have
in
fact
submitted
an
acceptable
program
to
the
secretary
which
has
just
been
approved,
and
i
think
that
the
topographical
conditions
there
are
very
similar
to
what
they
are
in
the
western
district
of--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
don't
think
they
are.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
would
say
not,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
it
is
in
the
statute,
and
so
we're
telling
you
about
it.
but
i
don't
think
it's
absolutely
necessary.
thank
you.
