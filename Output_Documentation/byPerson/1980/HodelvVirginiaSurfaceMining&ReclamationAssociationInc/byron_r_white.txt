justice
white
mr.
buscemi,
what
does
that
investigation
show
the
effect
on
commerce
is
or
may
be
if
there
is
surface
mining
of
coal
without
restoring
the...
say,
the
high
wall?
justice
white
i
can
understand
why
surface
mining
might
be
said
to
affect
commerce,
but
that
wouldn't
mean
that
anything
that
congress
said,
ordered
with
respect
to
surface
mining
would
have
an
effect
on
commerce.
justice
white
well,
you
mean
anything
that
affects
the
environment
affects
commerce?
is
that
your
suggestion?
justice
white
well,
what
if...
what
if
virginia
had
a
law
that
required,
when
you
surface
mine
on
these
steep
areas,
that
when
you're
through
mining
you
flatten
them
and
cover
them.
now,
you
suggest
that
the
united
states
would
be
empowered
to
say,
because
of
its
effect
on
commerce,
would
be
empowered
to
say,
no,
you
may
not
flatten
them,
you
must
rebuild
them
and
reestablish
their
original
contour?
justice
white
well,
i'm
asking
you
what
that
is.
what
difference
does
it
make
to
commerce
whether
they
flatten
the
land
and
cover
it
or
restore
it
to
the
contour?
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
white
so
you
suggest
that
if
miners
want
to
not
restore
its
original
contour
in
these
steep
places,
they
need
not?
justice
white
well,
so
you're
not
answering
my
question,
again.
suppose
that
virginia
says,
go
ahead
and
gouge
out
and
strip
mine
the
way
you're
doing
it,
but
then
flatten
it.
instead
of
recontouring
the
area,
flatten
it
out,
just
flatten,
make
it
flat,
and
cover
it.
now,
the
united
states
could
nevertheless
require
that
they
restore
the
contour
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
white
well,
you
still
haven't
suggested
to
me
what
the
effect
on
commerce
is.
justice
white
no,
of
not
restoring
the
contour
but
flattening
it
and
covering
it
some
other
way.
justice
white
well,
don't
refer
me,
i
want
to
ask...
you
can
tell
me
what--
--we
have
no
way
of
reviewing
those
findings.
justice
white
well,
you
go
ahead
and
tell
me
what
impact
on
commerce
it
has.
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
white
i
can
understand
all
of
that
but
i
still
don't
identify
in
that
listing
any
specific
impact
on
commerce
by
a
failure
to
restore
the
original
contour
when
these
steep
places
are
mined.
justice
white
so
your
answer
to
me
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
particular
phase
that's
regulated
has
any
effect
on
commerce,
as
long
as
strip
mining
is
subject
to
regulation,
that's
the
end
of
the?
justice
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
i
take
it,
i
think
i
did
read
something
in
the
brief
or
in
the
papers
somewhere
that
if
the
land
could
be
flattened
instead
of
recontoured
and
restored,
it
might
well
be
of
considerable
value.
justice
white
now,
i
suppose
that
even
if
you
didn't
mine
it
and
flattened
it,
it
would
be
of
considerable
value?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
the
federal
government,
this
law
wouldn't
forbid
the
next
day
after
you've
restored
all
these
contours
and
all
these
high...
and
covered
all
the
high
walls,
if
for
some
other
reason
you
decided
to
flatten
the
land?
justice
white
five
years.
justice
white
what
happens
if
you
didn't
mine
it
in
the
first
place?
you
could
just--
justice
white
--take
the
whole
mountain
away
and
since...
and
have
it--
justice
white
--and
develop
your
land
that
way?
rather
than
taking
the
coal
out
first?
justice
white
well,
what...
the
only
taking
there
can
possibly
be,
then,
i
suppose,
is
in
the
sense
that
it
forbids
you
from
taking
the
coal?
because
you
could
now
go
ahead
and
flatten
the
land
and
build
a
school
or
a
factory
on
it
without
mining
it.
justice
white
oh,
i
know,
but
if
you
believe
your
allegation
that
if
you
flatten
the
land
it's
of
great
value?
justice
white
which
you
do
say
so.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
need
to
mine
it
to
have
it
be
of
value
if
you
flattened
it?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
either
under
the
tenth
amendment
or
under
the
fifth
or
both,
the
federal
government
could
not
forbid--
justice
white
--the
strip
mining
of
this
land,
just
flat.
just
an
outright
ban
on
strip
mining?
justice
white
yes,
but
it
does
say
that
if
a
state
wants
to
permit,
or
private
owners
want
to
strip
mine
and
then
use
it
for
something
besides
farmland,
the
federal
government
says
you
may
not
do
that,
at
least
without
first
making
it
back
into
farmland.
justice
white
by
sacrificing
his
bond.
