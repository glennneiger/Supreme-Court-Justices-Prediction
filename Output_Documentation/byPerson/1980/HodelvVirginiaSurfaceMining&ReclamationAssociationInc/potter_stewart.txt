justice
stewart
on
this
issue,
you're
the
respondent,
aren't
you?
justice
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
your
favor
on
this
issue?
justice
stewart
is
this,
then,
a
matter
of
the
extent
of
the
commerce
power,
or
is
it
a
matter
of
an
impediment,
in
this
case
a
constitutional
impediment,
erected
by
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments,
perhaps,
to
the
exercise
by
congress
of
the
commerce
power?
justice
stewart
as
i
understand
the
national
league
of
cities,
which
is
a
case
cited
a
good
deal
by
both
sides,
at
least
in
their
briefs
and
relied
on
considerably
by
you,
as
i
understand
that
case,
it
didn't
go
to
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power--
justice
stewart
--but
rather
to
an
impediment
to
the
exercise
of
the
commerce
power.
justice
stewart
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
i
mean,
in
other
words,
nobody
could
quarrel
with
the
scope
of
the
commerce
power.
if
congress
passed
a
law
regulating
newspapers,
that...
some
of
them
go
to
two
or
three
or
more
states,
but
it
might
run
directly
afoul
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
stewart
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
find.
justice
stewart
the
district
court.
justice
stewart
of
course
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
i
suppose
there
would
have
been
a
considerable
doubt
about
the
power
of
a
state
to
regulate
or
determine
that.
justice
stewart
there
were
no
zoning
laws.
justice
stewart
and
the
enforcement
of
local
criminal
law.
justice
stewart
and
yet,
how
do
you
reconcile
a
case
like
perez
v.
the
united
states?
justice
stewart
well,
i'd
succeed...
as
you
know,
i
dissented
in
that
case,
but
i
was
alone.
justice
stewart
no,
i'm
serious
in
my
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
case
runs
exactly
against
everything
you've
been
arguing
to
us.
justice
stewart
i
don't
understand
those
terms
and
i
can't
visualize
that.
justice
stewart
high
wall
is
a
vertical
wall?
justice
stewart
well,
the
requirement
of
filling
up
the
high
wall
completely
cancels
out
the
variance?
justice
stewart
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
stewart
what's
benchland?
justice
stewart
so
why
not
just
call
it
flat
land?
justice
stewart
it's
a
plateau?
justice
stewart
i
get
you.
yes,
but
the
attorney
general
says
that
that's
just
a
piece
of
rock
and
you
can't
put
anything
on
it,
it
won't
stand
that.
