justice
rehnquist
mr.
buscemi,
supposing
that
that
statute
at
the
phase
you
now
describe
didn't
talk
about
coal
at
all,
it
simply
talked
about
the
desirability
of
zoning
on
a
national
level,
and
congress
passed
a
law
saying
that
for
any
state
that
doesn't
zone
land
and
keep
a
certain
amount
of
prime
farm
land
in
existence
that
is
now
in
existence,
we
will
supersede
that
state's
regulatory
power
with
our
own
zoning
act.
do
you
think
it
has
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
do
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
chief
justice
hughes'
opinion
in
jones
&
laughlin
v.
nlrb,
when
he
was
upholding
the
national
labor
relations
statute,
he
said
that,
regarding
the
commerce
clause,
"undoubtedly
the
scope
of
this
power
must
be
considered
in
the
light
of
our
dual
system
of
government
and
may
not
be
extended
so
as
to
embrace
effects
upon
interstate
commerce
so
indirect
and
remote
that
to
embrace
them
in
view
of
our
complex
society
would
effectually
obliterate
the
distinction
between
what
is
national
and
what
is
local
and
create
a
completely
centralized
government.
"
now,
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
the
law
has
gone
so
much
beyond
that
that
that
is
no
longer
the
limit
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
there
is
no
rigid
separation,
then
it
seems
to
me
you're
just
pushing
it
to
the
outer
edge
and
saying
that
congress
can
supersede
any
state
authority
by
simply
a
set
of
findings
which
are
unreviewable
in
this
court,
or
any
other
court.
justice
rehnquist
but
a
state
is
not
free
to
decide
that
it
will
have
no
program?
justice
rehnquist
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
the
theory
at
any
rate
of
people
who
framed
the
constitution
the
idea
that
the
powers
of
government
resided
in
the
states
to
innovate
as
they
would
or
would
not
and
they
delegated
certain
powers
to
congress?
justice
rehnquist
the
federal
government,
although
perhaps
somewhat
fictionally
in
the
last
30
or
40
years,
has
been
referred
to
as
a
government
of
limited
powers.
justice
rehnquist
what
about
the
prime
farmland
regulation?
