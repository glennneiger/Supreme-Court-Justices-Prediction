mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
we
are
really
talking
about
the
idea
of
a
state.
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
something
is
too
local
to
be
reached
by
the
congress
through
the
exercise
of
its
authority
under
the
commerce
clause.
that
is
settled.
it's
not
even
a
case
that
involves
whether
the
congress
can
do
things
that
affect
state
functions,
because
that
is
also
settled.
environmental
laws
have
some
impact
on
that.
here
we're
talking,
on
the
other
hand,
about
a
wholesale
displacement
of
integral
state
functions,
because
the
act
in
question
results
in
the
abridgment
of
state
power
to
shape
its
communities
and
to
shape
its
future.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
you
know,
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
not
the
first,
that
the
commerce
power
was
sufficient.
i
would
urge
to
the
court
that
taking
the
commerce
power
this
far
would
stretch
it
to
the
breaking
point,
and
i
am
sympathetic
with
counsel--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
focus
on,
because
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court,
and
it's
the--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--in
this
case.
i
think
that--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--well,
that's
right,
and
i'm
not
going
to
concede
that
the
commerce
power
can
be
stretched
this
far.
but
even
if
it
were
found
that
it
could--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--as
the
court
has
said--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--it
still
collides
with
the
idea
of
federalism,
which
is
the
essence
of
american
democracy.
the
idea
that
the
people
speak
not
just
through
the
congress
but
that
they
speak
through
the
constitution,
which
means
that
there
is
a
role
that
exists,
that's
real,
that's
tangible,
that's
reserved
to
the
states
and
cannot
be
abridged.
the
flaw
in
this
case
is
not
that
it
touches
land
use,
because
this
court
has
held
that
congress
can
provide
who
must
be
served
in
restaurants,
how
much
can
be
grown
on
property,
who
it
can
be
sold
to.
but
this
decision
of
the
congress
erodes
the
whole
power
of
self-determination
because
it
prohibits
to
a
community
from
saying
what
goes
where.
no
one
will
contest
but
that
the
state
is
free
to
say
where
its
capital
will
be
located,
where
its
county
seat
is
to
be
located,
and
until
this
hour,
it
has
not
been
seriously
contested
that
the
question
of
community
planning
to
determine
the
layout
of
the
community,
its
shape,
its
face,
its
map,
is
integral
to
the
authority
and
the
integrity
of
a
system
of
state
responsibilities
in
a
constitutional
framework.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that
may
be
true;
in
the
last
80
years,
i
suppose,
it's
become
a
traditional
function
of
state
government,
recognized
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
as
recently
as
last
term
that
the
state
does
have
considerable
authority
in
community
planning.
and
even
in
earlier
times
it
was
the
state,
after
all,
that
mapped
out
the
roads
and
streets
and
the
confines--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--there
were
no
zoning
laws.
i
think
the
first
zoning
law
was
a
20th
century
development.
but
it's
not
the
question
of
the
period
of
time,
how
long
it's
been
in
effect,
whether
it's
a
traditional
function
or
not,
it's
how
important
it
is,
and
how
much
of
it
is
deep-seated
in
the
way
states
operate
today.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
they
were
not.
and
there
has
been
no
change
since
that
time.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
i
don't
concede
that--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--arguendo,
and
i
think
that...
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
talk
about
whether
or
not
this
power
had
been
given
rise
to
by
the
states,
or
exercised
by
the
states
themselves.
and
it
probably
wasn't
in
as
thoroughgoing
a
manner
as
it
is
now,
but
i
think
there
was
always
the
idea
of
community
planning.
after
all,
justice
chase
told
us
in
these
two
1869
cases
that
a
state
is
really
defined
as
territory,
people,
and
government,
and
that
the
overriding
idea
is
the
idea
of
a
community.
and
what
we're
arguing
here
is
not
some
doctrinaire
view
of
localism
but
the
idea
of
self-determination,
that
this
is
really
a
promoter
of
democracy.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that
was;
yes.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
that's
one
of
the
happy
by-products
of
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
entire
structure
that
one
state,
as
justice
brandeis
says,
is
free
to
experiment
and
not
put
the
whole
nation
in
peril,
that
legislation
that
is
novel
can
be
tried
in
one
state.
if
it
works
well
there
it
can
be
adopted
other
places,
but
it
doesn't
run
the
risk
of
making
a
national,
a
mistake
that's
hard
to
rectify
and
doesn't
take
into
account
the
differences
from
locality
to
locality.
i
think
that
this
act
of
congress
is
a
quantum
leap
into
the
vitals
of
the
tenth
amendment.
because
it
does
preempt
essential
attributes
of
state
sovereignty
and
the
scheme
is
exceedingly
intrusive.
we're
not
talking
here
about
extractive
techniques,
we're
not
talking
about
how
you
transport
coal
once
it
has
been
mined,
we're
not
talking
about
pollution
control.
we're
talking
about
the
shape
of
a
community.
and
i
think
in
answer
to
the
question
put
to
counsel
before
i
arose,
chief
justice
marshall
has
told
us
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
congressional
findings,
if
those
findings
in
fact
are
a
pretext
for
taking
on
authority
that
it
doesn't
have.
the
character
of
a
community
really
is
founded
in
land.
now,
i
don't
contest
that
indirectly
congress
can
reach
local
uses,
that
it
can
in
some
ways
affect
the
private
use
of
land.
but
here
it
is
taking
away
from
a
community
the
control
over
its
own
map.
the
congress
can
pass
clearly
and
constitutionally
a
whole
range
of
regulations
to
affect
all
manner
of
subjects,
but
not
to
displace
as
it
does
here
reserved
powers
to
the
state.
this
is
really,
if
i
might
say,
and
i
hope
it
will
be,
a
usery
ii,
because--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--well,
i'd
say,
first,
that
the
findings
of
congress
are
not
conclusive.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
if
there
was
such
a
finding,
i
would
believe
that
the
law
should
be
in
that
case
that
if
the
means
for
effectuating
the
end
of
an
abating
clause
is
so
intrusive
of
state
powers,
that
the
usery
opinion
would
come
into
effect
and
would
prohibit
the
means.
in
effect,
it
would
be
a
kind
of
balance.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
it's
intrusive,
and
of
course,
as
the
court
knows,
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
law
that
these
slopes
did
not
themselves
cause
floods.
in
southwest
virginia,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
in
buchanan
and
dickenson
and
russell
and
lee
and
scott
and
tazewell
and
wise
counties,
so
much
land
is
so
steep-sloped
that
if
this
act
is
upheld,
those
communities
in
the
state
of
virginia
are
going
to
lose
control
of
their
destiny.
and
i
think
that
this
case
draws
into
question
our
whole
system
of
local
governance.
land
use
planning
is
an
integral
part
of
statehood,
just
as
fire
protection,
police
protection,
sanitation,
parks
and
recreation.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
and
taxation.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
reconcile
that
too?
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
i
think
you
were
on
the
right
track
in
your...
it's
clear,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
state
and
its
people--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--well,
i
think
it
does
too;
and
i've
been
before
the
court
on
previous
occasions
to
urge
that
much
of
our
criminal
law
is
being
usurped
by
the
writ
of
the
habeas
corpus,
but
you've
told
me
about
that
and
i
won't
raise
it
again.
but
i
think
it's
a
serious
question.
i
just
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
to
urge
before
the
court
today
that
the
congress
can't
zone
the
whole
character
of
a
community.
now,
it's
clear
that
while
there
are
other
significant
issues
in
this
case,
the
diminution
of
value
to
the
property
as
the
result
of
the
original
approximate
contour
requirement
is
a
serious
question
of
constitutional
dimensions,
because
investment
backed
expectations
have
been
from
time
out
of
mind
that
decisions
about
land
use,
certainly
in
the
20th
century,
if
they're
made
by
anybody
except
the
people
themselves,
will
be
made
by
the
state
and
not
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
well,
i
think...
i
can
say
this
about
it,
that
it
has
no
benefit
to
virginia,
first
of
all,
factually,
because
the
high
wall
must
still
be
filled
back
in;
there
still
must
be
backfilling.
so
a
variance
is
of
no
benefit
to
us
at
all.
we
still
have
to
comply
with
the
law
of
gravity
which
really
overrules
the
law
in
this
case,
because
we
can't
fill
it
back
and
make
it
stay.
these
slopes
are
so
extremely
steep
that
when
you
put
the
fill
material
back
in
at
an
angle
like
this,
the
sedimentation
just...
it
won't
hold;
it
won't
bind
to
the
rock,
and
it
will
drift
away,
and
it
makes
it
impossible,
as
the
district
court
has
found,
to
do
that.
but
the
question
of
if
it
were
administered
in
a
manner
not
to
intrude
upon
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
authority
of
the
states
to
be
masters
of
their
own
destiny,
it
would
be
an
open
question.
i
would
think
it
would
still
be
so
intrusive
to
say
to
virginia,
you
could
only
have
coal
mined
and
the
land
taken
care
of
at
all
if
you
do
it
according
to
the
federal
law.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
the
original
approximate
contour
permits
of
a
variation,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
another
provision
requires
that
the
high
wall
must
still
be
backfilled
in.
and
so,
as
the
court
has
said
on
page
36-a
of
the
appendix,
"for
all
practical
purposes
the
backfilling
stipulation
destroys
the
usefulness
of
the
variance,
since
the
high
wall
must
still
be
covered.
"
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
contour
mining
is
involved
in
these
counties
in
the
following
manner.
someone
goes
into
the
side
of
a
mountain
where
you
have
these
veins
of
coal
that
are
maybe
two
to
three
feet
in
depth
and
they
outcrop
all
the
way
up
the
mountain.
they
go
in
and
cut
their
initial
cut,
which
leaves
a
bench
and
a
high
wall.
and
according
to
the
act,
the
overburden,
the
material
that's
dug
out--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--it's
like
a
cliff.
they'll
just
dig
straight
into
it
till
they
come
to
a
90-degree
angle.
the
overburden
is
then
required,
under
the
act,
to
be
put
back
down
in
a
valley
and
you
go
all
the
way
around
the
mountain.
the
way
it
works
in
southwest
virginia,
you
contour
right
around
the
side
of
the
mountain.
we
don't
really
have,
as
the
court
has
found,
any
of
this
top
of
the
mountain
mining.
it's
not
practical
down
there.
then,
after
you
get
started,
under
the
act,
you
take
the
overburden
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
put
it
back
up
on
your
bench,
and
then
you
backfill
all
the
way
around,
and
the
high
wall
under
the
act
has
to
be
covered
up
completely,
even
though
the
act
says
there
is
a
variance
under
the
original
approximate
contour,
if
you
have
to
fill
the
back
wall
up.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
have
said
before,
the
people,
territory,
and
government
add
up
to
a
state,
and
the
primary
concept
is
a
community.
there
are
certain
functions
that
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
to
be
essential
to
the
separate
and
independent
existence
of
a
state.
nothing
permits
the
direct
abridgment
of
certain
powers.
the
act
in
question
displaces
the
state's
freedom
to
structure
its
integral
operations
of
traditional
government
functions,
and
this
law
clearly
does
not
comport
with
a
federal
system
which
is
the
essence
of
our
system
of
democracy.
chief
justice
chase's
words
are
perhaps
best
on
this
point
when
he
said
that
our
republic
is
founded
in
a
constitution
which
in
all
of
its
provisions
looks
to
an
indestructible
union
composed
of
indestructible
states.
the
questions
raised
in
this
case
are
serious
and
of
constitutional
moment
because
if
those
communities
in
the
state
of
virginia
cannot
determine
what
the
face
and
shape
and
map
of
those
communities
are
going
to
be,
then
we
have
no
limits
to
the
commerce
power
anywhere
in
the
constitution,
and
to
cabin
and
to
curb
it
someday
in
the
future
will
be
even
more
difficult.
this
is
the
best
case
that
the
court
now
has
before
it
to
make
plain
what
has
been
thought
for
a
long
time,
that
there
are
limits
to
the
commerce
power,
that
those
limits
are
contained
in
the
constitution
itself,
and
that
when
the
commerce
power
is
exercised
in
a
way
to
undo
the
right
of
a
state
or
locality
to
be
master
of
its
destiny,
they
are
not
constitutional.
the
question
of
taking
has
been
amply
brought
out
in
the
brief.
the
court
has
found,
and
in
this
case
the
court
i
know
will
give
due
deference
to
the
findings
of
the
court
in
this
case
which
finds
that
the
land
is
of
no
benefit
to
the
landowners
except
that
it
can
be
surface-mined.
it
is
so
steep
and
of
so
little
value
that
this
act
in
effect
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
and
there's
an
anomaly
here,
because
if
i
own
a
mountain
and
decide
to
flatten
it,
and
built
a
school
in
the
exact
countours
that
the
man
who
owns
the
mountain
next
to
me
does,
but
first
takes
the
coal
out,
i
can
do
it,
i
can
put
my
school
or
shopping
center
there,
but
he
can't.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
not
tomorrow,
because
the
regulations
that
have
been
promulgated
say
that
the
bond
has
to
remain
in
effect
for
five
years.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
so
you
sit
there
and
wait
for
five
years
and
then
you
can
come
back
and
remove
the
overburden
all
over--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--exactly.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
dump
it
down
the
hill.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
you
take
the
coal
out
first
you're
prohibited
for
a
period
of
five
years
from
putting
that
land
to
its
only
economical
use,
which
is
a
flat
land
on
which
a
school
or
a
hospital
or
a
shopping
center
or
an
industrial
development
can
be
constructed.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
do
that
if
you
weren't
going
to
get
paid
for
getting
the
coal
out
first.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
but
i
think
that
the
court
recognizes
still
that
one
of
the
important
factors
in
taking
is
the
diminution
of
value.
obviously
the
diminution
of
value
is
pretty
large
if
you've
got
valuable
coal
in
your
mountain
and
you
can't
take
it
out
because
you
can't
afford
to
put
it
back--
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
--that's
right.
mr.
j.
marshall
coleman
i
would
guess
that
it
could.
no...
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much.
