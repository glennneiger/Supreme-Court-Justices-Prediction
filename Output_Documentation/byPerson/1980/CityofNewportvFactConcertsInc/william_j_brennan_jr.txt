justice
jr.
and
furthermore,
mr.
wells,
i
gather
you
say
that...
i
guess
you've
settled
that
the
1983
liability
of
a
municipality
requires
the
plaintiff
to
prove
that
it
is
a
matter
of
municipal
policy?
justice
jr.
not
just
accident,
but
affirmative
policy:
the
municipality
has
violated
the
federal
constitutional
statutory
rights
of
the
plaintiff,
on
purpose,
done
it
on
purpose.
justice
jr.
and
notwithstanding
all
that,
you
say,
no
punitive
damages?
justice
jr.
of
course,
the
municipality
has
no
immunity
defense
either.
justice
jr.
after
city
of
independence.
justice
jr.
is
rhode
island
one
of
them?
justice
jr.
mr.
wells,
as
you've
been
talking
deterrents,
you've
been
arguing
no
deterrents,
am
i
wrong?
it
seems
to
me
when
i
was
in
practice
we
used
to
talk
about
punitive
damages
as
"smart
money".
justice
jr.
that's
a
different
element
from
deterrents,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
understood
it
to
mean.
to
make
it
hurt.
justice
jr.
it
smarts,
and
you
did
it
to
punish
somebody,
if
you
please,
for
having
done
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
jury
said--
justice
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
the
punitive
awards
against
the
individual
councilmen
have
not
been
appealed?
justice
jr.
you
mean,
a
cage?
justice
jr.
now,
what
they
did
was
deny
a
permit,
was
that
it?
justice
jr.
and
did
they
cancel
the
license?
justice
jr.
is
this
the
old
newport
jazz
festival
of
years
back
or
what?
justice
jr.
you
say
that
monell
and
such
narrowed
it--
justice
jr.
--abolishing
respondeat
superior,
because
it
requires
now,
before
a
municipality
may
be
liable,
proof
of
policy.
justice
jr.
and
i
gather
your
argument
also
is
that
policy
necessarily
means
proof
of
intention?
justice
jr.
to
deny
the
constitutional
or
federal
statutory--
justice
jr.
--well,
mr.
decof,
what
of
the
situation
in
this
very
case,
for
example?
i
suppose
it's
possible
the
jury
could
have
found
the
municipality
liable
as
having
a
policy,
and
yet...
but
has
no
immunity
defense,
and
yet
the
individual
councilmen
would
have
had
an
immunity
defense,
and
the
jury
might
have
found
them,
no
cause
of
action
as
against
them
based
on
an
immunity
defense--
justice
jr.
--but
a
finding
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the
municipality.
what
do
you
say
then
about
punitive
damages?
justice
jr.
under
1983?
