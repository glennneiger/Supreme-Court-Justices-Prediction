justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
judgments
related
to
this?
the
trial
judge
reduced
the
punitive
damage
award
against
the
city
from
$200,000
to
$75,000,
as
i
remember
it.
and
was
there
not
also
a
punitive
damage
award
against
other
defendants?
justice
stevens
for
how
much,
and
is
that
a
joint
and
several
liability,
or
a
separate
judgment?
justice
stevens
you're
way
over
75
by
now.
justice
stevens
you're
way
over
75
with
two
over
40
and--
justice
stevens
--well,
now,
were
those...
if
they
collected
those,
that
75
from
the
individuals,
could
they
get
this
75
from
the
city
in
addition?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
the
record
tells
us
whether
the
city
or
some
insurance
company
or
who
will
actually
pay
the
punitive
damage
award
against
the
individuals?
