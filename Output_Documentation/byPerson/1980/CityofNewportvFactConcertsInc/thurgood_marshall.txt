marshall
they
are
the
same
people
that
are
on
the
jury
too,
aren't
they?
justice
marshall
do
you
mean
that
there
are
people
on
juries
in
rhode
island
that
are
not
taxpayers?
justice
marshall
who
are
not
taxpayers?
justice
marshall
in
this
day
and
age,
who
is
not
a
taxpayer?
justice
marshall
how
could
they
be?
justice
marshall
don't
you
have
sales
tax
in
rhode
island?
do
you?
justice
marshall
but
they
are
taxpayers.
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
identical.
i
said
they
were
of
interest.
justice
marshall
that's
all
i
said.
and
all
you
should
have
said
was
"yes",
and
you
would
have
saved
all
of
this
trouble.
i
took
it
that
what
you
meant
was,
these
aren't
taxpayers
who
are
going
to
share
in
the
burden
of
this
verdict?
justice
marshall
what
is
this?
the
right
to
hear
the
music
or
the
right
to
play
the
music?
justice
marshall
before
you
get
to
all
the
facts,
answer
my
question.
justice
marshall
so
the
question
was
the
right
to
hear
it
or
the
right
to
play
it?
justice
marshall
and
that
affects
a
whole
lot
of
people.
justice
marshall
yes,
it
really
does.
is
there
any
analogy
between
this
and
the
sound
truck
cases,
the
right
to
control
sound
trucks
going
up
and
down
the
streets
in
a
case
some
years
ago
here?
justice
marshall
what's
a
tiger
case?
justice
marshall
the
newport
festival
is
now
in
new
york
city,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
it
isn't
even
up
there.
justice
marshall
and
it
wasn't
up
there
this
time
either,
was
it?
justice
marshall
it
was
riding
on
the
name,
yes.
justice
marshall
but
they
are
not
here.
justice
marshall
they
are
not
here,
are
they?
justice
marshall
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't
appeal
that?
justice
marshall
they
did?
justice
marshall
the
councilmen
are
not
here,
are
they?
justice
marshall
about
two-thirds
of
your
time
you've
been
quoting
councilmen,
and
they're
not
here.
justice
marshall
if
you
get
the
punitive
damages,
would
that
be
easier
to
collect
than
these?
would
more
damages
be
easier
to
collect
than
less
damages?
justice
marshall
so
here
you
want
to
go
against
the
municipality?
justice
marshall
and
what
did
the
municipality
do?
justice
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
marshall
do
you
want
the
payment...
do
you
want
to
charge,
to
use
your
own
words,
the
innocent
taxpayer?
justice
marshall
that's
who
you
want
to
collect
from.
justice
marshall
the
case
that
you
had,
you'd
be
bleeding
about
this
innocent
taxpayer
and
that's
who
you
want
to
pay
it.
