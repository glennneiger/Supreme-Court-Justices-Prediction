mr.
guy
j.
wells
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
this
afternoon
to
decide
whether
municipal
governments
all
across
this
nation
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
new
and
potentially
ruinous
form
of
damage
assessment,
a
form
of
damage
assessment
that
clearly
was
never
contemplated
by
the
42nd
congress.
it
clearly
is
founded
in
no
strong
policy
purpose.
and
it
wholly
fails
to
accomplish
any
of
the
remedial
purposes
of
section
1983.
an
award
of
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality
lacks
either
a
historic
or
a
societal
justification.
now,
an
affirmative
answer
to
the
question
presented...
that
is
to
say,
is
a
municipality
liable
for
punitive
damages
in
a
1983
case...
an
affirmative
answer
to
that
question,
it
seems
to
me,
will
wreak
havoc
with
the
balance
of
governmental
powers
in
the
united
states
without
producing
any
significant
corresponding
social
purpose,
even
aside
from
the
questions
of
division
of
governmental
powers,
what
logic
or
reason
supports
a
damage
structure
which
punishes
the
innocent
without
deterring
the
guilty.
now,
going
to
the
historic
background
of
1983,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
punitive
damage
awards
against
municipalities
were
wholly
beyond
the
ken
of
the
42nd
congress.
up
until
1871
no
court
in
this
country,
with
one
exception...
and
that
exception
was
clearly
remedied
very
shortly
thereafter...
no
court
of
the
united
states
had
ever
upheld
a
punitive
damage
award
against
a
municipality.
and
the
lawyer
members
of
the
42nd
congress
couldn't
have
helped
but
know
that.
there
was
a
plethora
of
authority
on
that
subject
at
that
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
none
of
the
courts
of
england
had
ever
upheld
a
punitive
damages
award
against
a
municipality.
if
one
wants
to
look
at
legislative
history
as
this
court
has
done
in
considering
the
question
of
compensatory
awards
against
municipalities,
one
only
has
to
look
at
the
remarks
of
congressman
kerr,
congressman
butler,
and
congressman
poland.
now,
admittedly,
those
remarks
were
directed
to
debate
on
the
sherman
amendment,
but
we
must
remember
that
the
sherman
amendment
was
aimed
directly
at
municipalities,
the
sherman
act
which
passed
the
senate
and
died
in
the
house.
and
each
of
those
gentlemen
speaking
to
the
question
of
the
impact
of
the
sherman
act
indicated
that
it
was
intended,
and
they
believed
it
was
intended,
to
be
entirely
remedial.
i
believe
representative
blair
said,
it
is
not
punitive
or
penal
but
remedial
only.
and
i
believe
that
one
can
read
that
as
representing
the
thinking
of
even
some
of
the
most
radical
members
of
the
42nd
congress.
i
suggest
that
a
punitive
award
would
have
been
totally
abhorrent.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
i
am
limited
here
to
talking
because
of
the--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--no,
no,
sir.
i
am
suggesting
here
that
i
am
talking
only
about
punitive
damages
against
municipalities.
i
recognize
that
this
court--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--it
does,
sir,
yes.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
i
believe
representative
butler
was.
i
think
perhaps
representative
kerr
was
an
opponent.
but
it's
interesting
that
they
were
in
complete
agreement
with
respect
to
the
import
of
that
act.
and
of
course
the
sherman
act
was
a
precursor
of
1983.
now,
the
reasons
why
i
think
that
a
punitive
award
against
the
city
was
abhorrent
to
congress
in
1871,
the
reasons
for
that
are
as
compelling
today
as
they
were
then;
even
perhaps
more
compelling.
obviously,
an
award
of
punitive
damages
has
an
immeasurable
impact
upon
the
financial
structure
of
a
city
and
today
we
have
seen,
like,
for
instance,
the
examples
of
new
york,
cleveland,
boston;
we
know
about
them
simply
because
they
are
matters
of
national
interest
and
we
read
about
them
all
the
time;
but
i
suggest
that
they
are
multiplied
a
thousandfold
in
smaller
municipalities
throughout
this
country.
and
one
only
has
to
read
the
briefs,
particularly
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
briefs
of
the
national
institute
of
municipal
law
officers,
to
understand
the
real
menace
or
the
real
sword
of
damocles
that
is
hanging
over
the
heads
of
our
cities
and
towns.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
you
see,
perhaps
that
is
so.
if
they
like
them
i
guess
they
can
take
their
chances.
in
this
case
newport
attempted
not
to
take
its
chances,
but
beyond
that
the
scope
of
1983
is
so
broad
and
i'm
sure
this
court
is
aware
that
today
1983
cases
are
multiplying
like
rabbits.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes,
i
say
that,
sir.
and
i
say
that--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--that's
true,
sir.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
no
punitive
damages
against
the
municipality.
and
i
say
that
because
what
you
are
doing--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--that's
quite
true.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
that's
quite
true,
sir.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes,
sir.
but
i
suggest
that
the
reason
municipalities
ought
to
be
immune
from
an
award
of
punitive
damages
is
that
it
is
clear
that
the
function
of
punitive
damages
is
to
punish
someone,
and
to
make
an
award
of
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality
does
not
punish
anyone.
the
burden
of
a
punitive
damages
award
against
a
municipality
is
a
burden
borne
solely
by
a
taxpayer
at
the
time
the
additional
tax
is
assessed
or
by
the
person
whose
municipal
services
are
curtailed
as
a
result
of
having
to
take
out
of
the
budget
whatever
the
punitive
damage
award
is.
those
people
are
clearly
innocent.
they
are
not
the
actors
in
this
drama.
they
are
simply
people
who
have
to
come
up
with
the
money.
a
number
of--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
because,
for
instance,
this
case
was
tried--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--oh,
yes,
sir;
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
and
there
are
people
on
juries--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--well,
there
are
people
who
are
not
taxpayers
on
juries,
and--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--well,
there
may
be--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--well,
but
they...
they
don't
go
to
the
municipalities.
the
only
tax
base
in
rhode
island
in
the
municipalities
is
property
tax.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
true,
but
you
see,
again,
in
rhode
island,
we
will
be
drawing
juries,
any
jury
in
our
federal
court
comes
from
every
city
and
town
in
the
state,
so
in
a
trial
against
the
city
of
newport,
for
instance,
the
plaintiff
would
excuse,
and
properly
so,
all
residents
of
newport.
so
he
might
have
residents
of
providence,
warwick,
east
providence,
sitting
in
a
case
to
assess
punitive
damages
against
the
city
of
newport.
so
the
jury's
interests
are
not
necessarily
identical
with
the
interests
of
the
people
of
newport.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
true.
and
you
see,
you
will
have
some
persons--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--you
can't
buy
insurance
against
punitive
damages,
your
honor.
or,
i
think
you
cannot
buy
it...
and
many
states
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
do
not
permit
insurance
against
punitive
damages.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
i
have
never
known
of
a
policy
issued
in
rhode
island
that
covered
punitive
damages.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
in
automobile
cases
they're
excluded.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
under
the
statutory
policy
in
rhode
island,
that's
excluded.
punitive
damages
are
excluded.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
no,
sir.
well,
it
would
be
an
automobile
assault.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
that's
right.
but,
you
see,
further,
a
number
of
people
who
are
taxpayers
may
not
have
been
taxpayers
in
the
city
at
the
time
the
wrong
was
committed
but
who
moved
to
the
city
before
the
assessment
of
taxes
was
made.
similarly,
a
number
of
taxpayers
in
the
city
at
the
time
the
wrong
was
committed
may
have
moved
and
escaped
liability
altogether.
so,
again,
i
suggest
that
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality
serves
really
no
deterrent
purpose.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
one
of
the
things
that
the
trial
judge
said
in
passing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
judgment
n.o.v.
he
said,
well...
and
i'm
paraphrasing
this,
now...
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
on
the
taxpayers
of
the
city
may
have
an
influence,
a
beneficial
influence
on
the
next
election:
they'll
kick
the
rascals
out.
now,
i
think
that's
an
interesting
intrusion,
if
that
is
what
it
is,
of
the
federal
court
into
local
or
municipal
affairs.
but,
secondly,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
and
if
we
take
a
look
at
this
case,
the
wrong,
such
as
it
was...
and
i
suppose
we're
now
beyond
the
point
where
i
can
argue
that
it
wasn't...
but
the
wrong
occurred
in
august
of
1975.
since
then
we've
had
the
'76
election,
we've
had
the
'78
election.
then
we
had
the
trial.
we've
had
the
'80
election.
and,
of
course,
the
assessment
of
damages
won't
be
made
until
after
a
decision
on
the
issue
before
us
today
is
reached.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes,
he
did.
yes,
what
he
did
in
that
case,
he
decided...
the
original
award
against
the
city
was
$200,000,
and
against
the
individual
councilmen
in
varying
amounts
added
up
to
$75,000.
and
judge
pettine
reasoned,
and
i
think
correctly,
if
we
are
to
have
an
award
of
punitive
damages
that
the
city
could
not
be
more
guilty
than
the
councilmen
who
actually
committed
the
act.
what
will
happen
if
we're
talking
about
focusing
voter
outrage
on
elected
officials,
the
voter
outrage
won't
be
focused,
if
assessment
of
taxes
is
what
will
do
it,
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
only
thing
that
will
do
it,
the
voter
outrage
won't
be
focused
until
the
assessment
which
will
be
by
a
council
at
least
six
years
away
from
the
act
itself,
and
they
may
not
be
the
rascals
that
need
to
be
turned
out
at
all.
so
i
think
the
argument
that
punitive
damages
ought
to
be
awarded
as
a
deterrent
because
they'll
focus
attention
on
the
malefactors
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
in
the
light
of
practicalities.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
no,
your
honor.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
your
honor,
i
understand
that
and
i
had
intended
to
address
it
a
little
later
on,
but--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--i
should...
no,
i'll
meet
the
argument
now.
i
might
say,
i
did
not
try
that
case.
i
wasn't
retained
until
after
the
verdict.
if
there
was
ever
a
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
cries
out
for
the
application
of
the
plain
error
rule
or
the
relaxation
of
rule
51,
it
is
this
one.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
quite
true.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
troubled,
and
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
grappled
with
the
problem
when
they
could
have
said,
it's
rule
51
and
we're
not
going
to
even
listen
to
you.
i
think,
as
i
say,
they
were
troubled.
i
believe
a
fair
reading
of
judge
pettine's
opinion
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
indicates
that
he
was
somewhat
troubled.
and
i
suggest
again
that
the
court
should
relax
the
rule
here
for
two
real
reasons.
first
of
all...
and
again,
if
one
looks
at
the
amici
briefs,
this
is
a
problem
that
is
floating
around
all
over
the
country.
and
sooner
or
later
this
court
is
going
to
be
faced,
perhaps
in
a
better
procedural
context--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--well,
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
is
going
to
end
up
here
sooner
or
later
and
probably,
considering
the
volume
of
cases,
it's
from
the
point
of
view
of
judicial
efficiency,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
municipal
stability,
it
might
be
better
to
have
the
question
answered
as
quickly
as
possible.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
this
is
a
little
different
because
of
the
volume
of
cases
in
which
the
punitive
damages
issue
is
a
real
issue.
and,
secondly,
because
i
suppose
with
the
exception
of
people
who
live
on
indian
reservations,
for
instance,
or
federal
enclaves,
every
american
lives
in
a
city
or
town,
and
i
doubt
that
there
are
many
cities
or
towns
in
the
united
states
who
are
not
presently
having
some
forms
of
financial
problems,
and
to
settle
an
issue
of
this
kind
early,
i
think,
perhaps
stabilizes
their
relationships
with
the
government,
it
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
assess
the
kinds
of
things
that
they
are
going
to
do.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
really
believed
it
was
plain
error,
and
that
that's
why
you
find
that
language
you
referred
to
as
kind
of
fuzzy
language,
in
what
is
apparently
close
to
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
the
question
was
raised
below.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes,
there
were.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
no,
no.
there
were
five
councilmen,
and
a
mayor.
and
there
were
varying
awards
of
punitive
damages
against
them
which
totaled
$75,000.
i
believe
there
were
two
of
$40,000
and
a
couple
of
ten
and
a
couple
of
five,
something--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--pardon?
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
i
don't
have
the
precise
numbers
in
mind.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
absolutely,
and
that's
the
interesting
thing
about
punitive
damages,
because,
for
instance,
there
was
a
$72,000
compensatory
damage
award
against
the
councilmen
and
against
the
city.
now,
satisfaction
by
one
of
those
of
the
$72,000
satisfies
the
entire
compensatory
damage
award.
but
the
punitive
damage
awards
are
all
cumulative,
and
again,
this
is
one
of
the
problems.
in
owen
you
decide
that
you
can
collect
compensatory
damages.
and
that
makes
the
plaintiff
whole.
but
the
punitive
damages
as
to
him
represent
a
windfall.
the
only
justification
for
them
can
be
punishment,
and
against
a
municipality,
as
i
suggest,
you're
really
punishing
the
innocent.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
the
record
does
not
disclose
that,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
know
that
it
will
be
satisfied.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
yes,
sir,
i've
seen
that
phrase.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
well,
i've
never
been
sure
what
the
adjective
"smart"
meant,
whether
it's
"smarts"
or--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--yes.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
precisely,
but--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--that's
true.
and
the
problem
is,
or
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
is,
that...
while
i
know
that
this
court
has
never
precisely
passed
on
punitive
damages
in
1983
cases,
they're
being
assessed
against
individuals
as
they
were
in
this
case,
all
the
time.
and
so,
in
assessing,
for
instance,
as
against
the
councilmen
in
this
case,
you
are
making
an
example
of
them
as
actors,
but
in
assessing
it
against
a
municipality
you're
really
not
making
an
example
of
anybody
but
the
poor
taxpayer.
i
suggest
that
there
is
another
reason,
and
perhaps
it
is
more
procedural
than
anything
else,
that
militates
against
this.
as
i
have
always
understood
the
law
to
be,
the
wealth
of
the
actor
played
a
part
in
the
assessment
of
punitive
damages.
if
you
were
a
very
wealthy
man,
the
jury
was
entitled
to
know
that,
assess
a
larger
amount
of
damages
against
you,
because
they
had
to
do
something
that
would
hurt
you,
that
would
smart.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
absolutely
none,
and
there's
absolutely
none
against
the
municipality.
and
of
course
the
municipality's,
i
suppose,
power
to
tax
is
limited
only
by
the
real
property...
at
least
in
rhode
island...
within
its
corporate
bounds.
but
how
do
you
measure
what
its
wealth
is?
it
may
have
long-term
commitments,
it
may
be
building
a
school,
it
may
be
doing
a
variety
of
things,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
an
evidentiary
point
of
view
you
would
end
up
with
weeks
and
weeks
of
discussions
of
municipal
finances
before
you
ever
found
out
how
wealthy
the
city
really
was
or
how
poor
it
really
was.
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
another
reason
why
the
punitive
damages
scheme
doesn't
fit
in
with
municipalities.
but
just
to
conclude,
again,
historically--
mr.
guy
j.
wells
--no,
your
honor,
they
were
not.
again,
i
say,
historically,
there's
no
reason
for
anyone
to
suspect
that
the
congress
intended
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality;
that
it
serves
no
societal
purpose;
and
that
it
really
punishes
the
innocent
rather
than
the
guilty
actors.
there
are
remedies
against
the
actors
that
are
imposing;
there
are
criminal
sanctions
in
the
appropriate
case;
there
are
injunctive
relief;
there
are
punitive
damages
awarded
against
an
individual.
and
to
suggest
that
an
additional
award
against
a
municipality
is
going
to
deter
that
individual
from
acting
just
doesn't
make
sense.
he's
more
worried
about
his
own
pocketbook
than
he
is
about
the
city's
pocketbook.
for
these
reasons,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
1st
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
guy
j.
wells
no,
your
honor.
