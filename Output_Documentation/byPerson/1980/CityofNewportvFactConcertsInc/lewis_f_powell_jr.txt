justice
jr.
mr.
decof,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
indemnification?
in
your
opinion,
is
a
city
permitted,
does
it
have
the
authority
to
indemnify
council
members
whom
you
say
maliciously
violated
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
jr.
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
city
attorney.
but
you
accepted
it,
did
you?
justice
jr.
i
understand.
so
you
accepted
it
for
your
client?
justice
jr.
and
you
didn't
consider
the
power
and
authority
of
the
city
to
enter
into
that
sort
of
an
agreement?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
then.
if
cities
may
indemnify
councilmen
who
deliberately
violate
the
constitution
for
any
punitive
damages
assessed
against
them,
what
deterrence
is
there
in
granting
punitive
judgments
even
against
the
individuals?
