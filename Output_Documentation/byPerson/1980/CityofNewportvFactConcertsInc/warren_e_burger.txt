we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
city
of
newport
v.
fact
concerts.
mr.
wells,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
you'd
make
an
exception
of
those
cities
and
towns
that
happen
to
like
rock
concerts?
chief
justice
burger
--well,
it's
another
form
of
exemplary,
to
make
an
example,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
was
there
any
showing
here
as
to
the
resources
of
the
individual
defendants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
decof.
chief
justice
burger
how
does
that
relate
to
this
kind
of
an
award
in
this
setting?
chief
justice
burger
was
it
not
pursued
in
that
court
beyond
a
temporary
restraining
order?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
how
do
we
know
whether
the
judge
was
right
or
not?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
go
back
to
a
reference
you
made
to
a
stipulation
with
your
friend.
chief
justice
burger
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
judgments
which
are
now
firm
and
unreviewable
against
the
individuals
will
be
paid
for
by
the
municipality?
chief
justice
burger
now?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
so
that,
even
if
you
do
not
prevail
here,
you
are
going
to
collect?
chief
justice
burger
it's
implicit,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wells?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
