mr.
leonard
decof
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
wells'
argument
is
bottomed
on
the
allegation
that
the
innocent
taxpayers
would
be
the
ones
who'll
bear
the
burden
of
a
punitive
damage
award.
this
argument
could
be
made
against
every
provision
of
1983:
the
innocent
taxpayers
bearing
the
burden
of
a
compensatory
award,
or
the
innocent
taxpayers
bearing
the
burden
of
injunctive
relief.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
punitive
damage
award
is
the
least
expensive
kind
of
deterrent
that
we
can
buy.
in
any
given
case,
injunctive
relief
provided
under
1983
will
normally
be
far
more
expensive
than
a
given
punitive
damage
award.
prison
reform,
for
example,
goes
on
for
years
and
years.
it
costs
all
kinds
of
money,
into
the
millions.
it's
far
more
intrusive.
mr.
leonard
decof
with
reference...
mr.
wells
was
making
the
argument
that
the
innocent
taxpayer
carries
the
burden
of
the
punitive
damage
award.
that
same
argument
could
be
made
with
reference
to
injunctive
relief,
or
reference
to
compensatory
damages.
i
submit
that
the
punitive
damage
award
is
necessary
under
1983,
especially
since
carey
v.
piphus,
because
of
the
reason
that
mr.
wells
and
the
city
of
newport
tried
to
overlook,
the
deterrence
which
this
court
has
acknowledged
to
be
a
primary
underlying
premise
of
1983.
since
carey
v.
piphus,
where
the
courts
were
struggling
to
find
some
grounds
in
between
punitive
and
compensatory
for
awarding
a
substantial
sum
of
money
for,
i
think,
what
prosser
would
refer
to
as
"the
petty
outrages".
and
the
court
there
held
there
could
be
nothing
more
than
nominal
damages
for
violation
of
procedural
due
process
or
whatever.
there's
a
whole
spectrum
of
cases
which
would
support
nothing
more
than
nominal
damages.
how
much
is
it
worth
to
go
to
an
unsegregated
school?
how
much
is
an
individual's
voting
rights
worth?
how
much
is
it
worth
to
deliver
a
sermon
uncontrolled
by
any
censor?
and
so
on
down
the
line;
i
don't
have
to
belabor
the
obvious.
and
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
this
leaves
a
big
hole
in
1983,
because
these
petty
outrages
are
the
easiest
inflicted
and
the
most
insidious
and
the
most
difficult
to
guard
against.
mr.
leonard
decof
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
to
the
individual,
what
your
honor
has
just
stated
illustrates--
mr.
leonard
decof
--you
can't
show
damages.
but
they
are
very
damaging,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
sense
that
they
humiliate,
that
they
embarrass;
to
the
individual
they
are
very
damaging
and
they
occur
repeatedly.
the
"nice"
person
can
easily
focus
on
and
relate
to
outrages
such
as
whippings,
lynchings,
beatings,
and
the
like,
but
the
nice
person
isn't
so
easily
offended
by
the
gentleman's
agreement
type
of
discrimination,
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
the
most
difficult
to
police.
the
courts
have
struggled
with
years
over--
mr.
leonard
decof
--this
case...
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
facts;
i
know
the
facts
are
not
before
the
court
but
they--
mr.
leonard
decof
--this
case
was
a
case
where
the
city
of
newport
wanted
to
dictate
what
kind
of
music
would
be
played.
mr.
leonard
decof
it's
the
right
to
perform
it.
that
was
the
specific
question
here,
but
that
also
relates
to
the
right
to
hear
it
by
the
public,
but
what
they--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
with
reference
to
those
cases,
your
honor,
we
get
into
the
question
of
public
nuisance,
public
safety.
public
safety
was
raised
here.
the
jury
found
it
to
be
a
spurious
defense.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
just
touch
on
the
facts
because
this
is
a
classic
example
of
why
nothing
but
punitive
damages
will
serve
to
answer
the
problem.
the
councilmen
in
this
case,
four
of
the
six
councilmen
and
the
mayor,
were
the
very
same
people
who
had
only
the
very
same
year
been
enjoined
by
the
very
same
chief
judge
for
a
similar
violation,
for
limiting
the
freedom
of
expression
or
the
right
of
free
speech.
this
was
the
"tiger
cage"
case
where
some
people
wanted
to
place
a
tiger
cage
case
in
a
public
park
to
demonstrate--
mr.
leonard
decof
--please,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
decof
it
was
a
tiger
cage;
yes.
yes,
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
protest
against
the
vietnam
war,
that
we
were
incarcerating
vietnamese
prisoners
in
a
tiger
cage.
and
the
city
of
newport,
this
very
council,
refused
to
issue
the
license.
and
this
very
court
enjoined
them
and
said,
this
is
a
violation
of
free
speech
and
you
must
issue
this
license.
the
city
solicitor--
mr.
leonard
decof
--that
is
cited,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
41
and
in
the
record
appendix
which
was
filed
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
at
page
305.
mr.
leonard
decof
page
41,
your
honor.
and
that
was
the
tiger
cage
case.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
it
isn't
a
case
citation.
what
this
is,
your
honor,
is
a
record
of
the
testimony
of
the
individual
who
was
being
cross-examined
about
that
case,
having
appeared
in
that
case--
mr.
leonard
decof
--the
case
never
went
further
than
the
restraining
order
so
there
is
no
appellate
citation
of
that
case,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
leonard
decof
it
did
not
come
here,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
no.
when
i
said
"this
court"
i
meant--
mr.
leonard
decof
--the
district;
yes.
judge
pettine's
court.
and
that
case
occurred
within
months
before
this
incident
occurred.
mr.
leonard
decof
it
was
not
pursued
in
that
court,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
the
problem,
whether
the
judge
was
right
or
not,
if
the
court
please,
the
question
is
a
question
of
knowledge,
foreknowledge
by
this
council
in
going
back
in
again
and
doing
the
same
thing.
they
accepted,
or
the
city
solicitor
accepted
the
judge's
opinion,
and
the
city
solicitor
in
this
case
advised
the
city
council
and
the
mayor
that
they
had
no
right
to
do
what
they
intended
to
do.
in
spite
of
that
they
went
forward
and
did
it.
because
of
that
they
couched
their
denial
and
disguised
it
with
a
ruse,
claiming
that
a
portion
of
the
contract
had
been
violated,
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
about
this.
and
so
they
went
ahead
and
did
what
they
knew
they
shouldn't
have
done,
and
then
disguised
it.
furthermore,
these
same
councilmen,
particularly
councilman
west,
who
was--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no,
your
honor,
what
they
did
was,
my
clients,
facts
concerts,
had
a
license
from
the
city
of
newport
to
promote
a
musical
concert
at
fort
adams,
and
they
had
lined
up
the
greatest
jazz
stars
in
the
country,
and
one
of
them,
outstanding
performer
sarah
vaughn,
had
to
cancel
out.
and
my
clients
engaged
blood,
sweat
and
tears
to
take
her
place.
the
city
of
newport
upon
finding
this
out
said,
if
blood,
sweat
and
tears
appears
on
this
program,
we
would
cancel
your
license.
and
that's
what
set
the
facts
going
forward.
mr.
leonard
decof
they
did
cancel
the
license,
your
honor,
but
on
the
pretext,
which
the
jury
found
to
be
a
ruse,
of
some
chairs
not
having
been
wired
together.
they
canceled--
mr.
leonard
decof
--this
is...
that
was...
there's
a
jazz
festival
in
newport
every
year.
this
was...
the
old
newport
jazz
festival
was
run
by
george
wein.
this
was
run
for
the
first
time
by
my
clients
who
were
new
promoters.
by
the
way--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
this
was...
it
had
a
different
name.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
it
was
a
jazz
festival
at
newport.
mr.
leonard
decof
what
i
say
to
that
is
that
carey
v.
piphus,
your
honor,
was
footnoted
to
the
effect
that...
i
think
i
paraphrase
correctly...
this
is
not
to
say
that
we
indicate
that
punitive
damages
would
not
be
properly
awarded
in
the
proper
case.
in
carey
v.
piphus
there
was
no
evidence
of
punitive
damages;
there
was
no
set
of
facts.
in
carey
v.
piphus
i
think
it
was
footnote
9
stated
that
we
don't
mean
to
indicate
that
punitive
damages
would
not
be
recoverable
in
the
proper
case;
and
then
went
on
to
cite
a
number
of
lower
court
cases,
circuit
court
holdings,
where
punitive
damages
had
been
awarded
and
cert
had
been
denied.
and
in
carlson
v.
green
mr.
justice
brennan
indicated
again
in
dictum
that
punitive
damages
would
be
recoverable
on
the
proper
set
of
facts
and
cited
the
footnote
in
carey
v.
piphus.
so
although
it
was
dictum,
i
would
urge
this
court
that
this
court
has
at
least
edged
toward--
mr.
leonard
decof
--i
take
issue
with
that
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
in
those
days,
and
even
today,
with
every
state
that
has
a
statute
that
does
not
allow
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality,
that
state
also
has
respondeat
superior,
strict
liability,
liability
without
fault.
and
that
was
the
context
in
the
background
of
the
common
law--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
say
that
it
was
qualitatively
different
in
the
sense
that
it
was
liability
without
fault,
and
i
compare
it,
even
the
statutes
today,
to
the
workers'
compensation
acts
where--
mr.
leonard
decof
--a
state
said,
we
will
assume
liability,
but
we'll
put
a
cap
on
it;
this
is
the
trade-off.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
decof
but
i
think
also,
your
honor--
mr.
leonard
decof
--if
the
court
please--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
this
is...
you
took
away
respondeat
superior
and
you
established
municipal
liability--
mr.
leonard
decof
--and
to
my
way
of
thinking,
you
narrowed--
mr.
leonard
decof
--not
really
because
of
that.
i
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
court
historically
has
not
opted
for
a
mechanical
adoption
of
the
common
law.
they
will
adopt
the
common
law
if
it
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
purposes
of
1983,
and
a
major
purpose
of
1983
is
deterrence
and--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
precisely,
your
honor.
precisely.
and
when
the
court
came
along
later...
so
for
now
there
is
no
liability
without
fault.
now,
for
us
to
talk
about
a
situation
which
would
absolve
municipalities
of
the
most
egregious
intentional
malicious
violations
of
the
civil
rights
act,
i
think
we're
not
talking
about
an
extension
of
monell,
we're
talking
about
something
that
naturally
comes
before
monell.
i
would
think
this
court
would
think
first,
of
course,
the
purposeful
act
should
be
punished.
we'll
talk
later
about
taking
away
the
good
faith
defense,
which
was
done.
mr.
leonard
decof
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
exactly,
your
honor;
if
the
taking
away
of
a
good
faith
defense
does
not
mean
there
will
be
liability
without
fault.
fault
must
still
be
proven
even
though
it
may
be
in
good
faith.
and
another
corollary
to
this
is,
there
is
a
gap
between
absence
of
good
faith
and
proof
of
malice.
one
thing
that
would
be
accomplished
if
punitive
damages
were
allowed,
not
only
would
good
faith
be
an
allowable
defense
to
the
punitive
damages,
but
the
good
faith
would
be
presumed
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
municipality
because
it
would
be
the
affirmative
burden
of
the
plaintiff
to
show,
to
prove
malice.
mr.
leonard
decof
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
if...
but
they
would
have
had
to
find
that
the
municipality
acted
maliciously.
your
honor
points
up
the
example,
for
example,
of
the
statute
which
is
wrongfully
and
maliciously
enacted
but
carried
out
in
good
faith
by
somebody
else,
maybe
years
later
down
the
line.
it's
one
reason
why
we
need
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality.
you
may
not
find
the
person
who
enacted
that.
and
the
good
faith
would
be
a
defense.
or
supposing
a
police
chief
said
to
one
of
his
policemen,
go
out
on
the
street
every
night
and
frisk
everybody.
now,
that
policeman,
if
he
does
it
in
good
faith,
will
not
be
held
liable.
so
there's
a
tremendous
gap
that
punitive
damages
is
the
only
answer
to.
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
i
may
continue
to
show
how
it
classically
demanded
it,
the
councilmen
here,
besides
changing
their
stories
and
going
through
the
rules
and
having
had
foreknowledge,
stated
they
would
do
it
again.
councilman
west--
mr.
leonard
decof
--but
they
were
the
city,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
if
your
honor
please--
mr.
leonard
decof
--they
did.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
no,
that's
not
before
this
court.
it
was
appealed
to
the
1st
circuit.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
but
if
your
honor
please,
the
councilmen
were
the
city,
because
they
acted
by
unanimous
vote.
mr.
leonard
decof
because...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
this,
if
the
city
is
the
recipient,
or
the
target
of
award,
an
award
for
the
punitive
damages,
then
that
is
passed
on,
the
attention
is
directed
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
taxpayer
does
something
about
removing
those
offending
councilmen.
the
city
can
only
act
through
its
officers.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
yes,
they
were,
your
honor,
in
separate
amounts.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
they
totaled
$75,000
against
the
councilmen
and
the
mayor
and
they
totaled
$75,000,
as
reduced,
against
the
city.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
now,
your
honor.
sir?
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
not
a
penny
has
been
collected,
and
there's--
mr.
leonard
decof
--that's
another
question,
your
honor.
this
is
another
reason
for
the
need
for
the
punitive
damages
against
a
city.
one
of
the
purposes
of
1983
is
to
encourage
injured
plaintiffs
to
bring
their
actions.
if
they
can't
recover
more
than
nominal
damages,
they
won't
bring
them
just
to
recover
attorneys'
fees,
and
attorneys'
fees
are
allowable
for
that
purpose,
to
give
incentive.
one
of
the
reasons
that,
again,
they
might
not
bring
them
is
because
people
on
city
councils
ordinarily
cannot
respond
to
a
judgment.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
don't
know--
mr.
leonard
decof
--i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
collectible
or
not.
mr.
leonard
decof
the
judgments
are
on
appeal,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
leonard
decof
there
is
no
supersedeas
bond
filed
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
decof
there
was...
mr.
wells,
i
think,
inadvertently
erred
before
the
court.
because
of
the
problem
of
collecting
a
judgment
against
these
individuals,
a
stipulation
was
filed
and
an
agreement
was
reached
between
mr.
wells
and
myself
that
the
city,
the
need
for
the
city
to
file
a
supersedeas
bond
would
be
waived
if
the
city
would
indemnify
the
councilmen
for
the
judgments
against
them.
and
that
agreement
was
entered,
so
nothing
has
been
collected.
but
i
think
the
argument--
mr.
leonard
decof
--if
the
court
please,
the
damages
would
be
easier
to
collect
against
the
municipality
than
the
individuals.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that's
a
confirmation--
mr.
leonard
decof
--the
municipality,
acting
through
all
its
councilmen
and
its
mayor--
mr.
leonard
decof
--interfered
with
the
right
of
free--
mr.
leonard
decof
--if
the
court
please--
mr.
leonard
decof
--if
the
court
please--
mr.
leonard
decof
--i
don't
think
i
referred
to
them,
i
think
mr.
wells
referred
to
them
as
innocent
taxpayers.
i
urge
the
court
that
the
government
is
of
the
people
and
the
government
is
the
people,
and
we're
not
just
concerned
with
the
people
of
the
city
of
newport
or
the
state
of
rhode
island.
we're
concerned
with
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
it's
to
the
interest
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
these
losses
be
borne
by
the
taxpayers
of
whatever
locality
because
this
is
the
only
way
to
deter
this
from
happening
again
in
the
future.
this
is
the
point
i
urge
on
the
court.
mr.
leonard
decof
because
we
have
two
different
concepts,
your
honor.
that
is
liability,
totally
without
fault,
respondeat
superior.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
municipality
is
at
fault;
it
can
only
operate
through
its
agents
in
the
same
way
as
a
private
corporation.
mr.
leonard
decof
as
far
as...
but
it
operates
through
its
agents,
but
at
least
fault
must
be
found.
first,
there
are
these
protections.
number
one,
it
must
be
an
act
of
the
municipality,
and
number
two,
there
must
be
fault.
with
respondeat
superior,
if
an
agent
who
drives
a
garbage
truck
knocks
someone
down,
the
municipality
can
be
held
at
fault,
even
if
it
has
no
fault.
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
not
now,
your
honor,
but
under
respondeat
superior,
although--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
in
the
context
of
the
fact,
if
it
were
a
non-delegable
duty,
the
municipality,
in
my
opinion,
would
be
liable.
it
has
its
duties--
mr.
leonard
decof
--not
under
1983,
your
honor,
no.
i--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no.
i
would
say,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
decof
this
is
the
agreement,
that
the
municipality,
they
are--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no,
not
paid
for,
your
honor;
indemnification,
which
to
my
mind
would
mean,
if
the
others
don't
pay
it,
then
the
municipality
will.
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
not...
no.
what's
involved
here
is
$75,000
and
a
massive
principal
of
punitive
damages.
we
would
collect
the
remainder
of
the
award,
the
compensatory
and
the
punitive
damages
against
the
individuals
the
only
thing
before
this
court
is
a
$75,000
award
for
punitive
damages
against
the
city
of
newport--
mr.
leonard
decof
--your
honor
has
raised
a
very
good
question,
and--
mr.
leonard
decof
--i
am
not
the
city
attorney.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think,
in
this
case,
it
was
my
considered
judgment
to
accept
this
and
wrestle
with
that
problem
later
for
this
reason:
it
would
have
been
extremely
hard
to
collect
this
judgment
against
the
individual
councilmen.
one
was--
mr.
leonard
decof
--well,
you
said,
if
cities
may,
but
cities
don't
always.
and
very
frequently
the
individuals
who
have
committed
these
acts,
by
the
time
the
case
goes
to
court,
someone
else
is
in
office
and
they
don't
control
the
council
and
maybe
then
the
city
wouldn't
vote
to
indemnify.
but,
from
my
standpoint,
the
most
important
deterrent
is
the
deterrent
that
goes
against
the
city
because,
as
i
said,
the
city
is
there,
it's
permanent,
it
has
some
control
over
its
policies,
it
can
do
something
about
these
things.
it
can
see
that
these
things
are
not
done
again.
i
would
like
to
finally
touch
on
rule
51.
finally,
these
people
had
all,
had
indicated
that
they
would
do
it
again
if
given
the
chance,
and
so,
in
this
case,
again,
when
i
say
councilmen,
the
city
acted
through
its
councilmen,
we
have
a
situation
where
an
intentional
act
was
done,
it
was
done
with
knowledge
that
it
was
wrong--
mr.
leonard
decof
--policy
is
just
one
area
of--
mr.
leonard
decof
--no,
it's
true;
they
couldn't
bind
their
successors.
but,
again,
stopping
them,
an
injunction
hadn't
deterred
them
in
the
past,
and
the
threat
of
compensatory
damages
hadn't
deterred
them
in
the
past,
and
maybe
the
only
thing
that
would
deter
them
would
be
the
threat
of
punitive
damages
against
the
city,
so
that
the
city
would
say,
don't
do
this
anymore.
finally,
on
rule
51,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
wells'
argument
to
this
is,
this
is
an
important
question,
so
let's
blink
aside
rule
51.
and
i
submit,
that
argument
can
be
made
in
many,
many
cases
that
come
before
this
court.
rule
51
is
a
most
important
rule
for
the
orderly
processing
of
cases
and
i
think
that
for
this
court
to
say,
this
is
a
question
that
ought
to
be
decided,
we'll
overlook
rule
51,
would
be
an
invitation--
mr.
leonard
decof
--i
understand,
but
this
would
have
to
fall,
this
issue
was
raised
below.
the
attorney
for
the
city
of
newport
had
a
great
deal
of
notice
all
through
the
trial
that
this
was
an
issue.
memoranda
were
requested
by
the
judge
and
filed
by
me
and
given
to
him.
he
was
asked
specifically
by
the
judge
a
number
of
times
for
his
memorandum
on
punitive
damages.
he
was
asked
specifically
at
the
end
of
the
case,
do
you
have
any
objection
to
the
charge?
and
so
they
can't
complain
that
there
was
no
notice,
and
i
submit--
mr.
leonard
decof
--this
is
not
plain
error.
mr.
leonard
decof
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
i
cannot
agree
with
mr.
wells'
interpretation
that
they
felt
it
was
plain
error
because
the
exact
language
was,
"where
the
law
is
in
such
a
state
of
flux
and
there
is
no
appellate
decision
to
the
contrary,
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
say
that
the
trial
judge's
punitive
damage
instruction
was
plain
error.
"
mr.
leonard
decof
no,
they
didn't
say,
"even
if
error".
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think
they're
saying,
your
honor,
that
erring
on
the
side
of
caution
they're
saying
there's
no
way
we
can
say
this
is
plain
error
because
there
are
no
cases
to
the
contrary.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
your
honor;
yes.
mr.
leonard
decof
yes,
but
i
would
interpret
this
as
their
saying,
this
is
not
plain
error.
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
say
this
is
plain
error.
certainly,
it
doesn't
indicate
the
contrary
to
me.
mr.
leonard
decof
i
think
that's
an
old
harvard
law
school
case,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
on
my
moot
court
team
in
harvard
law
school,
your
honor,
we
had
this
in
our
briefs,
and
it's
been
used--
mr.
leonard
decof
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
decof
thank
you
very
much.
