justice

mr.
wells,
judge
pettine
did
grant
a
remittitur
of
the
punitive
damages,
didn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wells,
let
me
ask
you
this,
if
i
may,
along
the
lines
of
justice
white's
question.
on
page
a-15
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
is
the
last
paragraph
of
the
court
of
appeals'
appendix,
where
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"in
short,
the
present
state
of
the
law
as
to
municipal
liability
is
such
that
we
cannot
with
confidence
predict
its
future
course.
"
"where
the
law
is
in
such
a
state
of
flux
and
there
is
no
appellate
decision
to
the
contrary,
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
say
that
the
trial
judge's
punitive
damages
instruction
was
plain
error.
"
"see
united
states
v.
petrozziello.
"
"nor
is
this
a
case
containing
such
a
peculiar
circumstance
as
to
warrant
noticing
error
to
prevent
a
clear
miscarriage
of
justice.
"
do
you
read
that
as
a
flat
refusal
to
notice
the
error?
i
thought
it
was
a
little
bit
fuzzy
myself,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
saying
in
so
many
words
that
we
will
not
notice
the
error.
justice
rehnquist
that
could
be
said
with
respect
to
plain
and
flagrant
violations
of
the
rules
for
preserving
errors
through
the...
but
we
know
we
didn't
assert
it
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
didn't
raise
it
as
a
question
to
be
presented
on
this
petition,
but
it's
a
question
that
needs
answering
sooner
or
later
so
let's
answer
it
now.
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say,
we
ought
to
"relax"
the
rule
as
to
noticing
plain
error,
are
you
saving
that
we
should
review
the
court
of
appeals'
refusal
to
note
plain
error,
or
that
in
effect
the
court
of
appeals
did
regard
this
as
plain
error
and,
as
you
say,
grappled
with
it
in
an
entire
paragraph
rather
than
just
brushing
it
off
and
saying,
it
wasn't
raised?
justice
rehnquist
what
case
was
that?
where
do
we
find
that?
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
joint
appendix
cite?
justice
rehnquist
is
the
joint
appendix
the
tan?
justice
rehnquist
just
glancing
at
it,
page
41,
i
don't
see
a
case
citation.
justice
rehnquist
oh.
what's
the
citation
to
the
case
in
which
this
court
enjoined
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
it
came
here
and
was
heard,
i--
justice
rehnquist
--i
thought
you
said
it
was
this
court's
case?
justice
rehnquist
oh...
the
district
court.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
decof,
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
carey
v.
piphus
at
256
of
435,
where
it
says
that,
"to
the
extent
that
congress
intended
that
awards
under
section
1983
should
deter
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
meant
to
establish
a
deterrent
more
formidable
than
that
inherent
in
the
award
of
compensatory
damages?
"
justice
rehnquist
under
rhode
island
law,
can't
you
go
after
a
judgment
debtor
if
there
is
no
supersedeas
bond?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
concept
of
a
non-delegable
duty?
can
the
municipality
be
held
for
that
when
it
employs
an
independent
contractor
to
provide,
say,
policing
for
an
affair
like
this
and
the
federal
court
says,
that
was
a
non-delegable
duty,
you're
liable?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that...
i
meant
under
1983.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
decof,
why
then
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
in
judge
bownes'
opinion,
at
page
815,
didn't
they
simply
have
a
one-sentence
statement
saying
that--
justice
rehnquist
--this
is
not
plain
error;
no
objection
to
the
instruction;
period.
justice
rehnquist
to
say,
"we're
hard
pressed
to
say
it
was
plain
error.
"
isn't
the
same
thing
as
saying
it's
not
plain
error.
justice
rehnquist
it's
weaseling
a
little
more.
