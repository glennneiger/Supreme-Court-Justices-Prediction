justice
white
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
punitive
damages
would
have
been
improper
in
just
the
ordinary
case.
it's
just
against
the
municipalities?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
is
your
argument
that
no
punitive
damages
against
municipalities
because
no
punitive
damages
against
anyone?
justice
white
the
legislative
history
you're
citing
goes
only
to,
or
the
case
law
that
you're
citing
goes
only
to
municipalities?
justice
white
but
you
say
that
the
issue
is
whether
punitive
damages
would
ever
be
allowed
against
a
municipality?
justice
white
and
that
even
if
there's
a
deliberate
denial
of
first
amendment
rights
or
malice
or
what
have
you,
the
normal
underpinnings
of
punitive
damages,
if
they're
all
there,
nevertheless,
no
damages
like
that
against
a
municipality?
justice
white
no
insurance?
justice
white
even
in
auto--
justice
white
--you
mean
that
you
can
buy
it
for
that?
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
so
that
you
don't
get
coverage
for
reckless--
justice
white
--which
would
be
uninsurable?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
for
a
moment,
what
your
response
is
now
to
the
argument
that
this
issue
isn't
really
properly
before
us
in
the
sense
that
if
there's
an
argument
like
this
in
this
court,
how
could
it
possibly
have
been
plain
error?
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said;
it
wasn't
plain
error,
even
if
it
was
error.
and
you
failed
to
object
to
the
instruction;
and
do
we
just
sweep
that
under
the
rug,
or
what?
justice
white
we
cannot
because
the
respondent
is
defending
the
judgment
below
on
that
ground.
justice
white
excuse
me;
you
take
your
own
time.
justice
white
you
mean,
for
relaxing
the
plain
error
rule?
justice
white
of
course,
it
may
be
that
a
good
answer
to
my
question
is,
well,
i
rely
on
the
grant
of
certiorari,
which
is
limited
to
one
question.
justice
white
of
course,
you
could
say,
you
could
ask
us
to
waive
our
own
rule
against
considering
questions
not
raised
below
but
presented
here.
justice
white
well,
do
you
take
issue
with
the
submission
that
at
the
time
1983
was
adopted
the
controlling
case
law
was
against
punitive
damages
against
municipalities?
justice
white
that
may
be,
but
then
your
answer
to
me
is,
no,
you
do
not
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
the
law
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
1983
did
not
normally
contemplate
the...
for
whatever
reason--
justice
white
--did
not
contemplate
the
issuance,
or
the
imposing
of
punitive
damages
on
municipalities.
justice
white
so,
i
guess--
justice
white
--in
holding
that
municipalities
are
subject
to
1983,
in
monell--
justice
white
--we
said,
but
only
if
it's
municipal
policy.
justice
white
and
so
we
did,
we
apparently,
according
to
your
reading
of
the
cases,
we
construed
1983
not
to
reflect
the
common
law
in
that
case.
justice
white
because
we
didn't
permit
respondeat
superior.
justice
white
and
you
say
that's
why
you--
justice
white
--should
have
punitive
damages?
this
policy?
justice
white
why
then
would
you
limit
compensatory
damages
to,
against
a
municipality,
to
instances
where
it's
municipal
policy
rather
than
purely
respondeat
superior?
why
shouldn't
the
municipality,
which
is
the
government
of
the
people,
be
responsible
for
its
actors,
its
officer
actors?
justice
white
for
punitive
damages,
you
necessarily
have
to
rely
on
the
mental
attitude
of
the
actor
officers
and
their
conduct.
justice
white
and
hence
impute
that
kind
of
conduct
to
the
municipality,
which
is
making
them
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
others.
justice
white
well,
then,
how
about
compensatory
damages?
justice
white
well...
not
in
a
1983
action.
justice
white
yes,
exactly.
even
if
he
did
it
intentionally.
justice
white
well,
the
city...
you
couldn't
say
that's
policy?
justice
white
because
they
couldn't
bind
their
successors.
justice
white
well,
there
have
been
a
good
many
cases
here,
even
in
the
few
years
i've
been
here,
in
which
the
court
has
dealt
with
cases
which
weren't
even
raised
below,
dealt
with
issues
from
federal
courts
that
weren't
even
raised
below,
whether
plain
error
or
not.
justice
white
even
if
error?
justice
white
mr.
decof,
i'm
curious.
is
this
an
old
rhode
island
word
or
a
phrase,
"travel
of
the
case"?
justice
white
oh,
is
it
harvard?
since
when?
here's
a
fairly
young
harvard
graduate.
he's
glad
to
know
about
that.
