justice
white
does
this
go
for
the
entire
staff
of
the
president?
justice
white
you'll
just
go
no
farther
than
necessary
down
the
line?
justice
white
well,
is
it
your
submission
that
it
works
both
ways,
that
if...
not
only
for
advice
to
the
president,
but
the
execution
of
acts
or
duties
or
statements
that
the
president
directs
a
subordinate
to
commit?
justice
white
which
one
is
that?
justice
white
all
right.
but
whether
or
not
it's
carrying
out
an
order
of
the
president
or
giving
him
some
advice,
either
one?
justice
white
for
both...
either
kinds
of?
justice
white
i
understand
that;
i
understand
that.
but
which
is
it
in
this
case?
is
it
carrying
out
the
orders
of
the
president
or
giving
him
advice,
or
both?
justice
white
and
so
we
don't
need
to
get
to
giving
him
advice?
justice
white
do
you
think,
mr.
attorney
general,
there's
really
much
difference
between
deciding
the
good
faith
immunity
question
and
retroactivity?
if
the
law
wasn't
settled
it
isn't
retroactive
in
the
case
then?
justice
white
well,
what's
the
difference,
i
wonder?
has
there
been
a
remand
here?
justice
white
could
i
ask,
at
some
point
in
this
process
there
was
a
presidential
authorization
or
an
order
for
the
imposition
of
wiretaps?
justice
white
well,
now,
there
was
an
order
like
that?
justice
white
and
he
didn't
do
it
out
of
the
blue.
i
suppose
someone
recommended
to
him
that
he?
justice
white
and
they
advised
him
to
do
it?
including
dr.
kissinger,
i
suppose?
justice
white
he
never
ordered
it?
justice
white
i
know.
but
did
he
ever
order
it,
or
just
authorize
it?
justice
white
no,
just
any
wiretap,
for
this
purpose?
did
he
order
it
or
not?
justice
white
all
right.
and
so
that
he
said
that
to
whoever
had
the
responsibility
to
make
those
decisions?
justice
white
so,
if
kissinger
participated
in
the
imposition
of
the
taps,
it
isn't...
you
aren't
suggesting
that
he
was
acting
without
authority?
justice
white
so
he
was
exercising
the
authority
that
the
presidential
order
anticipated
that
he
carry
out?
justice
white
i
understand
you
have--
justice
white
--but
nevertheless,
kissinger
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority?
justice
white
and
within
the
scope
of
the
order?
justice
white
oh,
i
understand
that;
yes.
justice
white
well,
mr.
lynch,
is
there
any
decision
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
you
know
of
that
in
talking
about
executive
immunity
that
suggests
that
it
ever
has
extended
or
should
extend
to
criminal
immunity...
immunity
from
crime?
justice
white
aside
from
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
which
is
of
constitutional
dimension?
justice
white
so,
you
don't
think
the
government's
suggesting
that
the
president's
absolutely
immune
under
the
criminal
laws,
do
you?
justice
white
then
don't
say
that
they
are
suggesting
it,
that
their
immunity
is
unlimited.
justice
white
and
even
within
the
area
of
performing
his
presidential
duties,
i
don't
see
any
suggestion
that
he's
immune
from
violating
the
criminal
laws.
justice
white
well,
then,
but
you
said
a
minute
ago
the
government
was
suggesting
that
the
president
could
go
out
and
torture
someone
into
making
a
confession
and
that
he
would
be
immune
under
their
theory.
do
you
think
they
really
suggest
that?
justice
white
no,
i
said,
you
said
he
would
be
immune
from
having
subjected
someone
to
torture.
justice
white
you
mean
under
civil
liability?
justice
white
not
criminal?
justice
white
and,
mr.
lynch,
do
you
think
the
government
suggests
that
a
course
of
conduct
by
the
president
is
not
subject
to
an
injunction
suit
or
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
white
so
that
it's
just
damages
we're
talking
about,
not
just
immune
from
civil
suit,
but
from
damages?
justice
white
that's
what
we're
talking
about?
