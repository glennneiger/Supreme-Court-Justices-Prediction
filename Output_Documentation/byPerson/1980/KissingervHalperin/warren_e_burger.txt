we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
kissinger
v.
halperin.
mr.
solicitor

chief
justice
burger
what
kind
of
derivative
immunity
have
we
allowed
to
members
of
the
senate
or
the
congress?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
have
a
vague
recollection
that
chief
justice
warren
addressed
this
question
in
some
case;
that
is,
the
derivative
immunity.
do
you
recall
off
the
top
of
your
head
what
case
that
was?
chief
justice
burger
well,
no
matter.
no
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lynch.
chief
justice
burger
to
whom
was
that
information
conveyed
by
the
fbi?
chief
justice
burger
at
this
period
was
dr.
halperin
still
on
the
staff?
chief
justice
burger
then,
on
the
civil
side,
would
you
say
that
that
automatically
excluded
any
recovery
against
the
government
as
such?
civil?
chief
justice
burger
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
recovery
there,
under
the
civil
side?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
seem
to
concede
that
judges
are
above
the
law.
chief
justice
burger
so
that,
while
all
of
our
proceedings
and
all
other
judicial
proceedings
can
be
conducted
in
the
open,
you
concede
that
all
the
executive
functions
cannot
be
in
the
open?
chief
justice
burger
does
it
not
also
argue
equally
for?
chief
justice
burger
what
areas
of
the
function
of
a
governor
must
be
conducted
with
great
secrecy
and
privacy
as
compared
with
a
president
or
the
secretary
of
state,
and
secretary
of
defense,
for
example.
chief
justice
burger
that
was
a
question,
whether
he
was
dealing
with
an
insurrection,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
consider
that
comparable
to
dealing
with
some
of
our
active
adversaries
in
the
world?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
