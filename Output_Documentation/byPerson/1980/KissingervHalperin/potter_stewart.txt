justice
stewart
was
that
21
months
after
it
had
been
installed?
justice
stewart
i
notice,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
the
respondents
here
are
morton
halperin,
et
al.,
and
that's
the
members
of
his
family?
justice
stewart
and
that's
it?
they
were
the
plaintiffs?
justice
stewart
the
plaintiffs
were
all
halperins?
justice
stewart
well,
they
have
in
this
case
because
of
the
derivative
immunity
that
they
enjoy
from
the
presidential
immunity.
that's
your
argument,
at
least.
justice
stewart
and
this
is
true
because
they're
acting
in
effectuation
of
a
specific
program
for
which
he,
personally,
was
specifically
responsible?
justice
stewart
and
because
the
same
argument,
i
suppose,
could
be
made
for
any
white
house
aide
who's
acting
in
accord
with
general
authority
given
by
a
president.
justice
stewart
the
new
question
involved
in
the
so-called
keith
case,
as
you
call
it,
u.s.
v.
u.s.
district
court,
was
whether
or
not
a
warrant
was
required.
wasn't
that
the
new
question?
justice
stewart
well,
certainly
it
was
never
contended
that
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
was
a
constitutional
search
or
seizure,
was
it?
justice
stewart
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
was
reasonable.
justice
stewart
that
was
colonel
haig
at
that
time?
justice
stewart
well,
that
per
se
is
not
a
constitutional
violation,
is
it?
justice
stewart
i
thought
your
lawsuit
was
based
upon
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
stewart
the
order.
the
order
you
say
was
unconstitutional.
they
ordered
the
wiretap.
justice
stewart
now,
what
you've
told
us
might
be
a
reason
that
it
was
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
stewart
and
it
wasn't
a
bona
fide
foreign
security
tap.
justice
stewart
and
did
he
ever
thereafter
return
to
government
employment?
justice
stewart
and
of
course,
if
there's
absolute
presidential
immunity,
there's
absolute
presidential
immunity,
and
that
would
apply
if
a
president
should
go
out
and
put
his
hand
over
the
mouth
of
a
private
citizen
so
the
private
citizen
couldn't
speak.
justice
stewart
exactly.
justice
stewart
well,
there's
no
cause
of
action
there?
