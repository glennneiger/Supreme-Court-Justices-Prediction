justice
stevens
can
i
just
clear
up
one
point
of
confusion
on
my
part?
there
is
no
title
iii
issue
here,
not
because
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment,
but
rather
because--
justice
stevens
--you
did
not
petition
that;
right.
justice
stevens
would
that
also
apply
to
the
fbi
agents
who
did
the
actual
listening?
justice
stevens
and
the
phone
company?
justice
stevens
mr.
lynch,
for
purposes
of
the
president's
immunity,
is
there
a
difference
between
the
period
from
may,
'69,
to
may,
'70,
and
the
period
after
may,
'70?
justice
stevens
but
legally,
is
there
a
legal
difference
between
the
two?
justice
stevens
the
difference
is
one
just
of
motive,
and
motive
would
be
irrelevant
under
absolute
immunity.
justice
stevens
so
if
you're
right
after
may
'70,
you're
also
right
before
may,
1970?
justice
stevens
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
government's
position,
because
they
argue
there
should
be
a
functional
analysis
of
what
the
president
does,
just
as
the
judge
would
not
be
immune
if
he
went
out
and
wrestled
somebody
to
ground
in
something
totally
unrelated
to
judicial
proceeding.
don't
they
make
the
same--
justice
stevens
--they
do
make
this
functional
analysis--
--well,
so
long
as
he's
carrying
out
the
presidential
office,
and
that
was
true
in
stump
v.
sparkman.
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
say
he's
absolutely
immune
when
he
signs
a
bill
into
law,
for
example?
justice
stevens
so,
you
would
agree
there
is
some
absolute
immunity
for
the
president?
justice
stevens
well,
it
could
very
quickly,
but
is
he
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
which
would
mean
he's
entitled
to
win
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
without
any
showing
of
facts
other
than
that
all
he
did
was
sign
a
bill?
seems
to
me,
if
you
admit
that,
you're
admitting
the
government's
functional
analysis
approach.
justice
stevens
and
i
know
you'd
prefer
not
to,
but--
justice
stevens
--but
do
you
seriously
contend
that
he
has
no
absolutely
immunity?
say
he
orders
troops
into
battle
or
something
like
that?
it's
still
just
a
qualified
immunity?
justice
stevens
but
didn't
you
just
admit
the
partisan
political
purposes
are
only
relevant
to
motive?
they're
not
relevant
to
whether
or
not
there's
an
absolute
immunity.
