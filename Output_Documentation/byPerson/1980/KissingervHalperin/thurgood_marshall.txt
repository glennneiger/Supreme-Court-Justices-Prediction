well,
how
big
a
list
does
that
include?
justice
marshall
well,
don't
we
have
to
in
an
opinion,
say,
that
certain
people
have
this
great
immunity
end
others
don't?
justice
marshall
or
do
we
leave
the
same
worry
in
their
minds?
justice
marshall
well,
is
that
anybody
the
president
asks?
would
that
apply
to
a
private
individual
whose
advice
is
sought?
justice
marshall
well,
should
we
say
so?
justice
marshall
i
think
the
whole
thing
is...
i
personally
think
the
whole
thing's
involved,
as
to
how
far
a
president
can
go
in
authorizing
individuals
to
violate
people's
rights.
justice

who
had
possession
of
the
logs?
the
fbi
or
the
white
mouse?
justice

the
logs
of
the
wiretaps.
who
had
possession
of
those?
justice

number

you
couldn't
go
publicly
out
in
a
courtroom
or
anyplace
publicly
and
ask
for
permission
to
tap
somebody's
phone.
that
wouldn't
be
very
helpful,
would
it?
justice
marshall
case
number
one,
which
makes
it
a
little
different.
and
could
you
hold
your
meetings
in
public
if
you
were
trying
to
decide
whether
you
were
going
to
take
some
particular
military
action
or
diplomatic
sanction
against
another
country?
