mr.
mark
h.
lynch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
more
about
the
facts
of
this
case
against
which
petitioners'
legal
argument
must
be
measured.
to
begin
with
petitioner
kissinger,
our
case
against
him
is
not
based
on
any
advice.
indeed,
our
case
against
any
of
the
petitioners
is
not
based
on
the
giving
of
advice.
in
fact
i'd
be
hard
pressed
to
frame
a
complaint
under
bivens
that
was
based
on
the
giving
of
advice.
our
case
against
petitioner
kissinger
is
based
on
his
role
in
selecting
morton
halperin
as
a
surveillance
target.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
misspoke
when
he
said
that
fbi
director
hoover
assembled
the
list
of
wiretap
targets.
in
fact,
the
list
was
assembled
by
dr.
kissinger
at
the
national
security
council,
that
put
halperin
on
the
list
to
be
wiretapped.
he
put
halperin
on
the
list
to
be
wiretapped
despite
the
fact
that
dr.
kissinger
knew
that
halperin
did
not
have
access
to
the
information
related
to
the
b-52
bombing
story,
which
was
the
leak
that
triggered
the
wiretaps.
and
in
fact,
dr.
kissinger
also
knew
that
mr.
halperin
had
very
little
access
to
the
information
which
appeared
in
previous
leaks.
in
fact,
when
dr.
kissinger
asked
his
aide,
general
haig,
to
prepare
a
list
of
people
who
had
access
to
the
b-52
bombing
story,
haig
did
not
put
halperin's
name
on
the
list,
but
instead,
at
kissinger's
direction,
halperin's
name
was
put
on
the
list
and
it
was
transmitted
over
to
the
fbi.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i'm
sorry.
well,
it
was
colonel
haig
at
that
time,
and
later
he
was
promoted
to
general.
furthermore,
with
respect
to
our
case
against
kissinger,
it
is
based
on
his
role
in
keeping
the
wiretap
on.
there
were
a
number
of
instances
when
the
fbi
suggested
that
the
wiretap
be
taken
off,
in
the
very
early
days,
because
it
was
not
revealing
any
indication
that
halperin
was
a
leaker.
yet,
kissinger
persisted
through
haig
in
keeping
a
tap
on
halperin.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
in
some
instances
it
was
related
by
assistant
director
sullivan
through
haig.
and
there
is
one
point,
on
june
4th,
when
haig
prepares
a
memorandum
for
kissinger
to
serve
as
the
basis
of
a
discussion
with
hoover,
and
kissinger
testified
that
he
followed
the
outlines
for
that
memorandum,
and
haig
suggested
to
kissinger
and
kissinger
in
fact
spoke
to
hoover
about
the
fact
that
although
there
is
no
indication
that
halpirin
is
a
leaker,
we
should
keep
his
wiretap
on
for
at
least
two
more
weeks
to
establish
a
pattern
of
innocence.
so
he
was
very
directly
involved.
and
the
testimony
from
the
fbi
officials
indicates
that
they
regarded
kissinger
as
the
person
who
would
put
the
taps
on,
and
indeed
make
the
decisions
to
take
the
taps
off.
there
is
also
testimony
from
attorney
general
mitchell
that
kissinger
was
the
person
who
had
the
authority
to
finger
targets
and
to
decide
when
it
was
time
to
take
them
off.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
the
actual
logs
were
kept
at
the
fbi
summaries
were
made
and
sent
over
to
the
white
house.
early
in
the
surveillance
haig
went
to
sullivan's
office
and
literally
sat
down
and
read
the
legs.
sullivan
also
testified
at
one
point
kissinger
came
over
to
read
the
log.
kissinger
disputes
that;
we're
not
sure.
this
is
all
on
summary
judgment.
but
later
on
this
took
too
much
of
haig's
time
to
come
over
and
read
the
log
so
the
fbi
began
preparing
summary
letters
and
sending
them
over
to
the
white
house.
they
were
delivered
to
haig,
who
was
then
to
furnish
them
to
kissinger.
they
were
also
delivered
first
to
ehrlichman,
who
would
give
them
to
haldeman,
who
then
took
them
in
to
the
president,
and
there
is
testimony
that
he
actually
did
take
them
in
to
the
president
and
discuss
them
with
him.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes.
let
me
get
to
the
theory
of
our
case
against
nixon.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
there
was
an
order.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
no,
no.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
nixon
authorized
a
program
to
investigate
leaks
that
would
include
the
use
of
wiretapping,
if
necessary.
less
intrusive
means
were
supposed
to
be
used
initially,
interviews
and
physical
surveillance
and
so
on.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
but
so
far
as
we
know,
nixon
did
not
target
kissinger
at
the
beginning
of
the
wiretap.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
the
wiretapping
of
halperin?
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
he
said,
use
it
if
necessary.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
said,
go
ahead
and
wiretap.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
he
said...
yes,
he
said
that
to...
well,
he
very
simply
said,
i
want
it
done.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
in
the
selecting
of
people?
no.
he
was
told
to
do
that.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes.
but
now,
it's
important
to
understand
that
nixon
gave
him
three
criteria
for
selecting
people.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
and
halperin
fit
within
none
of
those.
xx--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes,
except
that
he--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes,
subject
of
course
to
the
limitation
that
the
fourth
amendment
places
on
the
exercise
of
this
authority.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
didn't
want
to
lose
that.
i
want
to
reiterate
that
our
case
against
nixon
is
not
based
on
telling
his
subordinates
to
go
out
and
investigate
leaks.
we
wouldn't
sue
him
if
that's
all
he
did.
our
case
against
nixon
is
based
on
his
very
personal
and
direct
and
continuing
involvement
in
the
use
of
this
information
for
partisan
political
activities.
this
point
is
probably
best
demonstrated
by
the
meeting
that
he
had
with
hoover--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--no.
this--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--that's
our
cause
of
action--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes.
without
warrants.
we
say
that
is
unconstitutional,
and
even
if
you
could
get
away
with
wiretapping
without
a
warrant
in
1969,
to
wiretap
for
this
length
of
time,
to
wiretap
people
for
whom
there
was
no
good
reason
to
wiretap
under
the
purported
purpose
of
the
wiretap,
would--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes.
yes,
sir.
i'm
explaining
now
why
nixon
is
in
this
case.
and
i
think
this
demonstrates
why
qualified
rather
than
absolute
immunity
is
an
appropriate
rule
to
apply
to
the
president,
quite
contrary
to
the
government's
position.
on
may
12,
1970,
nixon
met
with
hoover.
this
was
the
height
of
the
controversy
over
the
president's
decision
to
insert
troops
into
cambodia.
hoover
prepared
a
brief
of
the
highlights
of
the
surveillance
that
had
been
gleaned
in
the
two
weeks
since
the
cambodian
invasion
decision,
and
he
reviewed
those
with
the
president
at
this
meeting.
with
respect
to
halperin,
the
highlights
of
the
surveillance
included
the
information
that
halperin
planned
to
resign
his
consultant
status
with
the
national
security
council
in
order
to
protest
the
invasion;
that
halperin
planned
to
go
to
work
for
senator
fulbright
to
work
against
the
war;
and
that
halperin
and
other
individuals
were
setting
up
an
organization
to
oppose
the
war.
at
that
meeting
nixon
directed
hoover
to
no
longer
send
reports,
the
summary
letters,
to
kissinger
but
to
direct
them
exclusively
to
haldeman,
the
president's
alter
ego.
and
at
that
point
the
information
reported
in
the
summary
letters,
the
political
content
of
that
information,
becomes
much,
much
more
pronounced.
you
get
information
such
as
the
fact
that
halperin
is
lobbying
with
the
republican
senators
with
respect
to
legislation
that
was
pending
then
to
cut
funds
off
for
the
war,
and
the
white
house
wonders,
for
example,
if
senator
cotton
is
marginal
on
this
issue.
you
get
information
about
halperin's
attempts
to
set
up
this
organization
that
i
mentioned
earlier.
halperin
then
began
cooperating
with
john
gardner
in
common
cause.
the
white
house
learned
the
nature
of
the
foreign
policy
positions--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--no.
he
had
been
a
consultant.
let
me
give
you
the
chronology.
may
1969,
the
wiretap
was
put
on.
he's
cut
off
from
access
to
classified
information.
september
1969...
he
can't
do
much
without
classified
information
at
the
nsc,
so
he
resigns,
over
kissinger's
objection.
kissinger
offers
to
try
to
persuade
him
to
stay
on,
so
they
compromise
and
agree
that
halperin
will
be
a
consultant.
halperin
maintains
that
consultancy
from
september,
1969,
although
it
was
minimal,
until
may,
1970,
when
he
resigns
altogether
from
the
government
in
protest
of
the
cambodian
invasion.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
no,
he
hasn't.
he...
well,
he's
had
some
other
consulting
contracts,
i
think,
with
the
atomic
energy
commission.
but
that
may
even
have
been
before
may,
1970.
but
he
never
returned
to
full-time
government
service.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
our
case
gets...
clearly
gets
much
stronger
after
may,
1970.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
with
respect--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--that's
right.
it
goes
to
the
showing
you
have
to
make
under
the
qualified
immunity.
and
our
position--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
sure.
he
could
have
decided
the
way
to
find
out
about
these
leaks
was
to
go
pick
halperin
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
torture
him,
and
under
the
governments
position
he's
absolutely
wrong.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
we
think
that's
no
way
to
run
a
government.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
they
haven't
suggested
any
limiting
factor
that
i
can
discern,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
but
if...
yes,
yes.
but,
you
see,
the
presidency,
as
they
say...
correctly,
i
think,
although
for
the
wrong
purpose...
the
scope
of
the
president's
office
is
so
broad,
it's
not
limited
like
the
judicial
function
of
a
judge,
where
he
would
wrestle
someone
down
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes.
i
think
he
probably--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--i
would.
i
think
analytically
a
more
precise
way
to
say
it
is
that
the
scope
of
his
discretion
is
so
wide
in
some
areas
that
qualified
immunity
tends
to
merge
into
absolute
immunity.
i
would
prefer
to
call
it--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--a
district
court
would
throw
the
case
out
very
quickly.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
and
it's
a
slippery
slope,
to
try
to
decide
where
to
draw
the
line.
and
that's
why
i
would
prefer
to
call
it
qualified
immunity--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--with
a
very
broad
expansion
in
some
areas.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
practically,
i
don't
contend
that;
no.
and
i
think
ordering
troops
into
battle,
negotiating
treaties,
that
sort
of
thing.
but
where
he
comes
down
and
intrudes
himself
into
the
life
of
one
family
of
five
people
and
starts
listening
to
their
most
private
telephone
conversations
for
partisan
political
purposes,
that--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--that's
true.
well,
i
think
that's
an
aspect--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--and
which
is
very
limited
to
legislative
activity.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
no,
i
don't
think
they
do
suggest
that.
but
criminal
action--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--well,
it's
unlimited
with
respect
to
civil
suits.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that,
mr.
justice
white.
my
whole
discussion
is
within
the
context
of
civil
suits,
to
redress
violations
of...
civil
rights.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
if,
for
a
civil
suit
by
the
victim?
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
under
the
government's
argument--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--civil
liability
would
be
immune.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
not
criminal.
and
as
i
say,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
whole
discussion
relates
to
civil
suits
for
constitutional
violations.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that
depends
on
the
vagaries
of
whether
you
can
recover
under
the
federal
tort
claims
actions.
and
that
is
a--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--yes.
and
there
are
lots
of
problems
in
proceeding
under
the--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--no,
they
don't
suggest
that.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
they
want
to--
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
--that's
right.
turning
to
the
policy
rationale
for
the
qualified
immunity
applying
to
the
president
which
is
the
position
we
urge,
in
favor
of
qualified
immunity,
of
the
policies
which
this
court
recognized
in
butz
v.
economou,
the
first
of
all
is
the
importance
of
enabling
a
citizen
to
recover
for
the
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
secondly
is
the
interest
in
deterring
officials
from
undertaking
actions
which
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens.
and
in
butz
the
court
stressed
that
the
higher
an
executive
official
is,
the
greater
his
power
and
the
greater
his
capacity
to
inflict
harm,
and
therefore
the
need
for
deterrence
is
correspondingly
great.
we
submit
that
under
that
analysis
that
the
deterring
interest
is
at
its
peak
when
you're
dealing
with
the
president,
because
he
of
course
is
the
chief
executive
officer
with
the
greatest
degree
of
wherewithal
to
inflict
harm
on
people.
and
third,
and
most
fundamentally,
the
principle
that
in
this
country
no
man
is
above
the
law,
and
all
executive
officers
should
have
to
face
suit
if
in
fact
they
clearly
have
engaged
in
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
yes,
your
honor.
well,
they're
not
above
the
law.
they're
in
an
area...
yes,
they
have
absolute
immunity.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about
that.
but
the
policy
justification
for
that
is
much
different.
as
the
court
said
in
butz,
the
cluster
of
immunities
that
attach
to
participants
in
the
judicial
process
arises
from
the
nature
of
the
judicial
process.
it's
open,
it's
adversarial,
and
above
all,
errors
are
generally
correctable
on
appeal.
and
therefore
the
balance
has
been
struck
in
favor
of
absolute
immunity.
when
you're
dealing
with
the
executive
branch,
frequently
the
actions
are
not
open,
and
when
you're
dealing
with
violations
of
constitutional
rights,
there
is
no
appeal.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
bivens,
for
people
in
the
halperin
shoes,
it's
damages
or
nothing.
against
these
interests,
the
government
identifies
a
number
of
countervailing
interests
which
in
our
view
are
not
sufficient
to
alter
the
balance
that
was
struck.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
of
course
not.
that's
a
big
problem.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
no,
generally
that
has
to
be
conducted
privately.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that's
right.
and
that's
one
of
the
distinctions
between
executive
and
judicial
proceedings
that
argues
against
absolute
immunity
for
executive
officers.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
well,
i
think
if
you're
worried
about
the
disclosure
of
state
secrets,
for
example,
that
privilege
is
absolute,
and
if
a
damage
claimant
runs
into
a
properly
claimed
state
secret
privilege
assertion,
he
may
well
lose
the
suit.
the
suit
will
be
dismissed.
in
fact,
there's
a
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
halkin
v.
helms,
598
f.
2d
1,
where
that
precise
result
obtained,
and
i
was
involved
in
it
and
unhappily
lost.
we
couldn't
overcome
the
state
secrets
privilege.
so
those
interests
will
be
protected,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
principal
countervailing
interest
which
the
government
identifies
to
argue
against
the
qualified
immunity,
is
the
inhibition
on
the
president's
time
that
defending
such
suits
will
occasion.
bearing
in
mind...
and
it
has
to
be
borne
foremost
in
mind,
the
president
enjoys
the
greatest
degree
of
protection
of
any
official
under
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine.
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine,
as
was
spelled
out
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes,
which
in
fact
involved
the
chief
executive
officer
of
a
state...
which
while
not
obviously
on
all
fours
is
similar
to
the
situation...
very
clearly
spelled
out
the
principles
that
the
greater
an
official's
responsibilities,
the
wider
the
scope
of
his
discretion,
the
greater
the
exigencies
under
which
he
must
make
decisions,
the
greater
his
opportunity
to
prevail
under
qualified
immunity
will
be.
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
president
is
likely
to
escape
suits
in
all
situations
except
where
it
is
shown
that
he
is
directly
and
personally
involved
on
a
continuing
basis
in
the
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
such
as
is
demonstrated
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
well,
for
example,
the
government
of
governor
rhodes
in
scheuer
was
dealing
with
an
insurrection
at
kent
state
university,
and
he
had
to
decide
how
to
deploy
the
national
guard.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
well,
it
was...
it
was
a
very
violent
and
turbulent
situation.
whether
it
could
be
legally
defined
as
an
insurrection,
i
may
have
overspoke
on
that.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
no,
i
think
the
president,
because
the
president's
responsibility
in
dealing
in
foreign
policy
is
even
more
complex,
more
difficult
to
put
your
finger
on
the
optimum
right
course,
as
judge
leventhal
called
it,
the
president's
immunity
is
very
great
at
that
level.
and
gets
to
the
point,
where
as
i
was
speaking
with
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
was
probably
alive
with
absolute
immunity,
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
if
it
was...
if
the
effort
was
solely
to
identify
the
source
of
the
leak
during
world
war
ii,
i
would
say
that's
a
national
security
foreign
policy
problem.
but
if
the
wiretaps
continued
for
21
months
and
no
information,
no
evidence
of
leaking
had
come
in,
then
you'd
begin
to
suspect
that
the
purpose
had
shifted.
mr.
mark
h.
lynch
that's
entirely
possible.
and
the
theory
of
our
case
depends
very
heavily,
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
on
the
various
time
sequences
over
this
21-month
period.
it
may
be
in
fact
very
difficult
for
us
to
recover
for
the
first
week.
the
petitioners
may
be
able
to
make
a
very
strong
good
faith
showing
at
that
point.
but
when
you
get
out
to
the
end
of
the
21
months,
we
think
we
should
have
a
much
easier
time
to
recover,
assuming
we
get
over
this
absolute
immunity
hurdle.
one
of
the
other
interests
that
the
government
has
identified
as
militating
in
favor
of
an
absolute
immunity
is
the
artfulness,
or
the
danger
of
artful
pleading,
and
the
fact
that
the
president
will
be
ensnared
in
insubstantial
lawsuits.
again,
this
is,
the
empirical
evidence
does
not
support
this
argument,
and
in
this
case
we
have
very
solid
evidence
to
support
our
claims,
and
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
judge
gesell
in
his
concurrence
proposed
a
higher
standard
for
a
plaintiff's
overcoming
summary
judgment,
while
he
advocated
that
higher
standard
he
certainly
didn't
suggest
that
we
hadn't
met
it
in
this
case.
the
courts
in
our
view
have
such,
the
district
courts
have
such
great
discretion
in
the
timing
and
scheduling
of
suits
that
they
can
use
their
ingenuity
and
the
flexibility
that's
vested
in
them
under
the
federal
rules
to
make
accommodations
for
the
president's
time,
so
that
if
you
get
one
of
these
situations
where
the
president
is
deeply
involved
in
a
clear
violation
of
constitutional
rights
and
it
is
necessary
to
procure
his
evidence,
that
can
be
done
with
a
minimum
of
imposition
on
his
time.
if
contrary
to
our
submission
the
court
decides
that
absolute
immunity
is
appropriate
for
the
president,
we
of
course
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
contention
that
the
petitioners
kissinger,
mitchell,
and
haldeman
enjoyed
derivative
immunity.
if
the
court
were
to
accept
this
doctrine
it
would
substantially
erode
the
system
of
deterrence
that
the
court
has
sought
to
foster
in
butz.
in
other
words,
if
the
president
is
free
to
violate
constitutional
rights
with
impunity,
it's
essential
and
absolutely
important
that
his
associates
be
constrained
from
doing
so.
i
think,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
don't
have
anything
further
i
need
to
say.
