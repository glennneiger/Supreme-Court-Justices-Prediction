mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
requires
this
court
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
nation
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
personal
immunity
of
the
president
of
the
united
stales
and
his
closest
advisors
for
money
damages
arising
from
the
claimed
violation
of
constitutional
rights
resulting
from
the
performance
of
his
official
duties.
in
butz
v.
economou,
decided
during
the
1977
term,
the
court
held
that
although
a
qualified
immunity
from
damages
liability
should
be
the
general
rule
for
executive
officials
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
there
are
some
officials
whose
special
functions
require
a
full
exemption
from
such
liability.
we
submit
that
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
constitutional
head
of
the
second
branch
of
government,
is
preeminently
such
an
official,
and
that
officers
carrying
out
his
express
directions
should
be
protected
by
an
immunity
derivative
of
his.
the
facts
in
this
case
may
be
succinctly
stated.
between
february
and
april,
1969,
when
the
nation
was
engaged
in
armed
conflict
in
southeast
asia,
the
president
and
several
of
his
top
advisors
were
deeply
concerned
about
unauthorized
disclosures
to
the
news
media
of
confidential
information,
including
foreign
policy
documents.
the
president
feared
that
the
unauthorized
disclosure
of
this
material
would
jeopardize
the
government's
foreign
policy
initiatives,
and
would
seriously
undermine
the
confidence
of
our
allies
in
our
reliability
about
classified
disclosures
to
us.
the
nature
of
some
of
the
unauthorized
disclosures
made
the
national
security
council
a
likely
source
of
the
security
leaks.
accordingly,
the
president
met
with
the
attorney
general,
the
director
of
the
national
security
council,
and
the
director
of
the
fbi,
to
discuss
remedial
measures.
upon
the
advice
of
the
fbi
director,
that
electronic
surveillance
would
be
a
method
of
discovering
the
source
of
the
leaks,
the
president
authorized
the
use
of
wiretaps.
the
fbi
director
prepared
a
list
of
officials
in
the
office
of
the
national
security
council
advisor
who
had
access
to
documents
similar
to
those
that
were
released,
and
who
possessed
other
characteristics
that
suggested
that
they
might
be
likely
sources
of
the
unauthorized
disclosures.
this
list
included
the
name
of
dr.
halperin,
principal
respondent
in
this
case.
the
attorney
general
approved
the
installation
of
a
tap
on
the
residence
phone
of
dr.
halperin
and
that
was
accomplished
in
may,
1969.
summaries
of
information
obtained
from
this
disclosure
were
prepared
and
disseminated,
ultimately
through
the
assistant
to
the
president,
mr.
haldeman,
another
one
of
the
petitioners,
who
would
bring
pertinent
data
to
the
attention
of
the
president
and
to
the
director
of
the
national
security
council.
the
tap
failed
to
reveal
that
dr.
halperin
was
the
source
of
the
leaks,
and
it
was
removed
from
the
telephone
on
his
residence
in
february,
1971.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
two
years
later,
when
dr.
halperin
learned
of
the
tap,
he,
his
wife,
and
children
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
this
action,
alleging
that
the
wiretap
was
unlawful
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
under
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
petitioners,
other
federal
defendants,
and
the
telephone
company
were
named
as
defendants
and
monetary
damages,
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
were
sought.
after
extensive
discovery,
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
title
iii
claim...
that's
the
omnibus
crime
and
safe
streets
act...
was
granted,
and
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
appeal.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
these
are
his
wife
and
children,
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
are
the
respondents.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
plaintiffs
are
all
halperins.
they
are
respondents
here.
addressing
the
fourth
amendment
claims,
although
it
recognized
that
there
was
justifiably
grave
concern
in
1969
over
jeaks
and...
and
i'd
like
to
quote...
"even
granting
the
inapplicability
of
the
general
warrant
requirement,
the
district
court
held
that
the
wiretap
was
constitutionally
unreasonable
because
it
was
continued
for
21
months
without
an
effort
to
minimize
the
number
or
type
of
conversations
overheard.
"
the
court
imposed
liability
in
the
following
manner:
upon
the
former
president
for
not
imposing
temporal
or
informational
limits
on
the
taps;
upon
the
attorney
general
for
having
failed
to
carry
out
review
and
renewal
obligations
over
the
21-month
period;
upon
the
assistant
to
the
president
for
having
reviewed
the
information
for
over
a
year
without
recommending
termination,
for
disseminating
information,
and
for
purposes
unrelated
to
the
original
justification.
it
found
no
liability--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--we
did
not
petition.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
district
court
found
no
liability
on
the
part
of
dr.
kissinger.
the
district
court
also
determined
that
the
president
and
the
other
petitioners
were
not
entitled
to
an
absolute
immunity
for
damages
liability
and
although
their
conduct
was
not...
and
i
would
like
to
quote...
"a
wanton,
reckless,
or
malicious
disregard.
"
of
respondents'
rights,
nevertheless
they
were
not
entitled
to
a
qualified
good
faith
immunity
from
damages
liability
because...
and
i'd
like
to
quote
again...
"their
activities
relating
to
the
wiretap's
continuance
were
unreasonable,
and
in
violation
of
established
fourth
amendment
rights.
"
and
because
"they
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
established
law.
"
since
respondents
proved
no
actual
injury,
they
were
given
the
relief
of
having
certain
exonerating
material
placed
in
dr.
halperin's
file
and
they
were
awarded
nominal
damages,
one
dollar.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
it
held,
first,
that
the
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
a
warrant
for
electronic
surveillance...
and
there
was
none
here...
in
national
security
cases
would
be
applied
retroactively
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
in
damages.
it
also
concluded
that
petitioners'
failure
to
terminate
the
tap
within
a
reasonable
time
also
gave
rise
to
a
damages
action
for
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
also
concluded
that
petitioners
are
not
entitled
to
an
absolute
immunity
from
damages
nor
to
a
qualified
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law
with
respect
to
the
continuance
of
the
taps,
because
there
were
no
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
the
surveillance
was
in
accord
with
the
constitution.
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
when
the
continuation
of
the
wiretap
became
unreasonable,
and
whether
petitioners
acted
in
good
faith
in
authorizing
a
warrantless
electronic
interception
for
national
security
purposes
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
united
states
district
court,
a
case
that's
known
as
the
keith
case.
it
held
that
respondents
could
be
awarded
damages
for
emotional
distress
and
for
other
intangible
injuries,
and
it
reversed
the
award
of
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
dr.
kissinger
and
remanded.
now,
at
the
outset,
we
contend
that
to
subject
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
personal
damages
for
official
acts
in
his
capacity
as
the
nation's
chief
executive
is
contrary
to
compelling
reasons
of
public
policy
as
well
as
to
the
design
of
the
constitution.
we
submit
that
absolute
immunity
is
absolutely
necessary
to
protect
the
decision-making
processes
of
the
president
in
his
conduct
of
the
official
business.
the
risk
of
personal
liability
would
inhibit
the
fearless
and
decisive
exercise
of
presidential
authority
which
the
nation
has
a
right
to
expect.
just
as
a
judge,
who
this
court
has
determined
enjoys
absolute
immunity,
must
make
decisions
in
controversies
fraught
with
passion,
and
so
must
presidents
often
make
discretionary
decisions
about
controversial
issues
that
affect
the
lives
of
virtually
every
american,
especially
in
areas
of
national
defense
and
foreign
affairs
which
are
involved
in
this
litigation,
the
president's
discharge
of
these
duties
should
be
motivated
solely
by
his
concern
for
the
good
of
the
nation,
and
not
at
all
by
the
fear
of
damages
awards.
and
these
fears,
we
submit,
are
not
de
minimis.
in
butz
v.
economou,
the
ad
damnum
was
$32
million.
it
is
manifest,
we
submit,
that
a
qualified
immunity
is
inadequate
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
the
vigorous
and
fearless
performance
of
a
president's
constitutional
duties.
the
skillful
pleader
can
easily
avoid
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
alleging
malice,
bad
faith,
and
unreasonableness,
and
impose
on
the
president
the
burden
of
the
time,
the
expense,
the
personal
anxiety,
and
the
inevitable
distraction
of
litigation.
judge
gesell,
the
only
district
judge
who
was
a
member
of
the
appellate
panel
in
this
case,
directed
our
attention
to
what
he
called
the
increasing
frequency
by
which
plaintiffs
are
"filing
suits
seeking
damage
awards
against
high
government
officials
in
their
personal
capacities,
based
on
alleged
constitutional
torts.
"
and
he
expressed
grave
doubts
whether
the
usual
tests
apply
to
determine
the
existence
of
genuine
issues
of
controverted
fact
would
afford
any
protection
to
a
president
from
extensive
discovery
delving
into
his
innermost
thoughts
and
probing
his
mind
to
determine
whether
and
how
he
acted
in
his
official
capacity.
we
submit
that
in
a
subsequent
matter,
as
we
point
out
in
footnote
34
on
page
37
of
our
brief,
that
this
court's
expectation
in
butz,
that
"insubstantial
lawsuits
can
be
quickly
terminated
by
federal
courts.
"
alert
to
the
possibility
of
artful
pleading,
and
that
"firm
application
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
will
insure
that
federal
officials
are
not
harassed
by
frivolous
lawsuits.
"
has
not
been
realized,
as
a
separate
opinion
of
mr.
justice
powell
asserts
in
hanrahan
v.
hampton,
which
has
been
characterized
as
the
longest
jury
trial
in
the
history
of
united
states
courts,
and
must
go
back
again
for
several
months
of
trial
to
determine
whether
a
qualified
immunity
which
was
given
to
the
federal
defendants
in
that
case
was
available
to
them.
we
next
contend
that
absolute
presidential
immunity
should
extend
to
officials
who
acted
at
his
direct
and
express
direction
to
carry
out
his
authority.
it
is
obvious
that
a
president
can
only
act
per
alios
and
if
his
alter
egos
do
not
enjoy
the
same
absolute
immunity
which
we
submit
he
should
receive,
then
the
public
interest
in
his
fearless
discharge
of
his
constitutional
duties
will
be
utterly
frustrated.
we
also
contend
that
an
absolute
immunity
for
damages
should
attach
to
the
giving
of
advice
to
the
president
pursuant
to
article
ii,
section
2,
of
the
united
states
constitution
by
the
heads
of
his
departments.
the
fear
of
personal
liability
on
the
part
of
a
department
head
who
is
asked
to
render
advice
to
the
president
would
deprive
the
chief
executive
officer
of
exactly
what
the
constitution
intended
for
him
to
receive,
the
best
judgment,
the
honest,
frank
and
considered
opinion
of
his
subordinate.
however,
in
this
case,
to
deny
absolute
immunity
would
dry
up
the
source
of
the
kind
of
advice
that
would
be
necessary
for
the
discharge
of
the
public's
business.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
we
think
that
we
can
avoid
that
question
here,
because
we
submit--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
think
mr.
justice
white,
that
these
are
separate
things.
one
is
the
immunity
derivative
of
the
president,
which
would
shield
a
person
who
might
not
have
it
in
his
own
behalf.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
feel
that
that
should
be
the
basis
for
the
disposition
of
this
litigation--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--we
think
there
should
be
an
absolute
immunity
for
both.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
for
either
or
both,
but
we
think
the
court
can
avoid
determining
whether
the
subordinate
has
an
absolute
immunity
at
all.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
executing
the
orders
of
the
president
and
so
therefore
it
would
be
derivative
of
his
absolute--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--we
submit
it;
it
is
not
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
think,
again...
i
can't
answer
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
we
can
focus--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
think
we
can
focus
on
the
petitioners
in
this
case
and
say
that
they
have
it,
and
we
can
wait
until
another
day
to
determine
whether
someone
with
lesser
rank
in
the
executive
department
should
enjoy
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
we
follow
that
approach,
we
needn't
reach
the
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
think
not,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
it's
not
involved
in
this
case.
if
the
court
wishes
to
express
itself,
of
course
it
will.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
derivative
immunity
which
we
claim
for
him
would
protect
these
persons
here
without
determining
what
inherent
immunity
they
themselves
possess.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
submit,
to
focus
on
another
branch
of
government,
it's
clear
that
a
judge
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity
has
an
absolute
immunity.
we
suggest
that
if
he
directed
a
member
of
the
staff
of
the
court,
specifically,
to
do
something
which
if
he
did
himself
would
afford
him
the
absolute
immunity,
that
that
person
would
enjoy
an
immunity
derivative
of
him.
the
clerk
of
the
court,
for
example.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
where
the...
in
the
gravel
case,
where
the
legislator
himself
would
enjoy
immunity,
if
the
chief
counsel
of
a
committee
acted
at
his
direction,
he
would
be
protected
by
the
derivative
immunity.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
legislator
would
not
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
then
neither
would
the
person
who
acted
at
his
express
direction.
we
contend
here
that
this
is
specifically
within
the
president's
constitutional
authority,
the
areas
in
which
he
acted,
and
that
he
expressly
authorized
this
step
to
take
place.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
and
therefore,
that
he
should
have,
these
persons
should
have
a
derivative--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
think
it
should.
i
think,
analytically,
it
should,
if
expressly
directed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
the
telephone
company
is
out
of
the
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
i
would
prefer
to
let
them
speak
for
themselves
if
i
don't
have
to.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
although
the
opinion
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
dwelled
at
some
length
on
the
absence
of
a
specific
constitutional
grant
of
immunity.
we
submit
that
the
third
branch
has
no
express
grant
of
immunity,
yet
every
judge,
justice
enjoys
an
absolute
immunity
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity;
but
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
speaks
of
that.
this
court
has
also
decided
in
imbler
v.
pachtman
that
a
prosecuting
attorney
functioning
qua
prosecuting
attorney
also
enjoys
an
absolute
immunity
and
there's
nothing
in
article
ii
of
the
constitution
that
affords
him
that
immunity
either.
so
we
think
it's
not
of
consequence--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it
may
have
been
the
gravel
case.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
he
would
not
have
been...
that
would
have
been
after.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
do
not.
it
may
occur
to
me,
and
if
it
does,
i
would
like
the
privilege
of
calling
it
to
the
chic
justice's
attention.
we
also
suggest
that
even
if
the
court
should
decide
that
petitioners
are
entitled
only
to
a
qualified
immunity,
they
are
nevertheless
entitled
to
a
qualified
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law.
qualified
immunity
occurs,
as
we
understand
it,
when
two
elements
are
satisfied:
first,
there
must
be
the
absence
of
malice
or
bad
faith;
and
second,
there
must
be
an
objective
test
that
the
conduct
is
reasonable,
that
there
was
no
settled
or
clearly
established
law
relating
to
the
alleged
violation.
now,
the
court
here
did
not
hold
that
there
was
malice
or
bad
faith.
the
court
instead
claimed
that
there
was
clear
established
law
violated
which
we
contend,
and
we
believe
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
is
erroneous.
we
submit
that
in
1969
when
these
taps
were
established,
it
was
far
from
being
clear
and
established
what
the
requirement
was,
either
for
warrants
or
reasonableness
in
national
security
wiretaps.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
only
two
years
before
these
wiretaps
were
initiated
that
this
court
first
held
that
electronic
surveillance
was
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
first
case
to
impose
a
warrant
requirement
for
electronic
surveillance
of
this
sort
was
the
so-called
keith
case
which
was
decided
after
the
taps
were
terminated
here,
and
that
concerned
surveillance
for
domestic
security,
and
not
foreign
national
security
surveillance.
and
it
wasn't
until
after
that
that
any
court
first
spoke
to
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
national
service
surveillance
for
foreign
security
purposes.
and
as
this
court
itself
said
in
the
keith
case,
it
was
addressing
a
matter
which
had
never
been
addressed
before
by
this
court.
and
we
believe
that
in
the
light
of
this
demonstration,
for
the
court
below
to
have
said
that
this
was
in
violation
of
settled
or
clearly
established
law
is
highly
erroneous,
that
it
is
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct.
well,
but
that's
involved
in
this
case,
too.
we're
just
saying
that
the
law
was
developing
in
this
area
of
what
is
required
for
electronic
surveillance,
what
is
required
for
electronic
surveillance
for
national
security
reasons
involving
domestic
persons,
and
what
is
involved
in--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--well,
that's--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
we
submit
that
in
the
field
of
the
area
of
national
security,
it
may
not
be
appropriate
to
take
the
test
of
reasonableness
from
criminal
cases,
and
apply
it.
for
example,
i
say
it
without
knowing
this
to
be
the
fact,
but
i
believe
that
there
is
a
basis
for
it,
that
we
may
be
conducting
national
security
wiretaps
that
have
had
several
years'
duration,
in
some
areas;
and
it
may
be
reasonable
in
the
context
of
foreign
surveillance
for
national
security
reasons.
whereas
to
conduct
surveillance
for
a
criminal
law
purpose
of
a
domestic
person,
might
be
unreasonable
if
it's
more
than
a
matter
of
a
few
days.
and
so
we
submit
that
this
is
an
evolving
area
of
the
law,
and
that
it
certainly
isn't
settled
or
clearly
established
law,
and
that
the
court
below
erred
in
asserting
that
it
was,
in
denying
even
a
qualified
immunity,
which
it
would
have
in
the
absence
of
malice,
and
in
the
absence
of
bad
faith,
in
the
absence
of
violation
of
clearly
established
law.
we
also
suggest
that,
as
butz
v.
economou
suggested,
the
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity
is
not
rigid,
it's
also
an
evolving
doctrine,
being
a
court-made
doctrine.
and
that
it
varies
with
the
scope
of
discretion
and
responsibility
of
the
office.
and
although
the
form
it
took
in
butz
v.
economou
was
a
bad
faith,
the
existence
of
bad
faith
or
the
violation
of
settled
or
clearly
established
law,
we
suggest
that
for
the
president
and
his
closest
advisors,
a
much
more
useful
formulation
of
qualified
immunity
would
eliminate
the
subjective
element
of
bad
faith
or
malice,
and
hold
only
the
objective
test
of
a
violation
of
settled
or
clearly
established
law.
and
we
suggest
this
for
the
following
reason.
this
would
permit
a
court
to
determine
the
question
of
damages
liability
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
make
unnecessary
the
deposing
of
the
president
and
his
closest
aides,
the
submission
to
them
of
interrogatories
to
answer,
and
possibly
the
necessity
of
trial.
and
still
it
would
afford
protection,
because
any
violation
of
settled
or
clearly
established
law
which
could
be
determined
objectively
would
curb
the
kinds
of
excesses
that
this
court
should
be
concerned
about
in
balancing
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
recompense
against
the
interest
of
the
entire
nation
in
the
conduct
of
the
office
of
the
president,
which
we
submit
is
seriously
undermined
by
either
the
absence
of
an
absolute
immunity
or
the
failure
to
construct
the
kind
of
qualified
immunity
that
he
might
have,
which
could
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
rather
than
as
a
matter
of
fact.
finally,
we
argue
that
judicial
decisions
establishing
constitutional
standards
for
national
security
surveillance
which
were
announced
after
the
halperin
wiretap
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
permit
an
award
of
personal
damages
for
federal
officials.
clearly,
those
decisions
are
all
subsequent
to
the
termination
of
the
tap
on
dr.
halperin's
phone,
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
applied
them
retroactively,
mistakenly,
we
believe,
under
the
standards
expressed
in
chevron.
the
standards
in
chevron
were
three.
the
first
was
whether
the
new
rule
was
foreshadowed
by
existing
law,
or
whether
it
established
an
overruling
of
a
longstanding
precedent.
and
we
suggest
that
this
court's
opening
language
in
the
keith
case
indicates
that
this
certainly
is
not
an
area
that
was
foreshadowed.
we
also
suggest
that
the
second
test
in
chevron
is
whether
it
serves
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule.
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule,
as
we
understand
it,
is
to
deter
conduct,
and
this
court
has
said
many
times...
in
linkletter,
for
example
that
conduct
that
has
already
occurred
is
not
deterred
by
imposing
personal
liability
after
the
fact.
and
the
third
standard
is
whether
the
retroactive
application
would
be
unfair,
and
we
submit
it
would
be
eminently
unfair
because
the
entire
genius
of
our
legal
system
is
not
to
hold
a
person
to
a
standard
genius
of
conduct
of
which
he
had
no
notice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they're
certainly
related,
and--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--in
making
the
determination,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
there
is
no
difference.
it
just
depends
upon
which
analysis
you
wish.
i'd
like
to...
and
there
has
not
been
a
remand
yet.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
if
this
court
decides
that
there
should
not
be
a
retrospective
application
of
the
decisions
creating
damages
liability
for
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
that
it
would
be
possible
to
avoid
an
expression
at
all
upon
the
matter
of
absolute
immunity,
if
the
court
desired
to
reach
that
point.
and
we
feel
that
these
two
areas
afford
the
people
of
the
united
states
the
protection
that
they
require
under
these
circumstances.
thank
you.
