justice
jr.
mr.
lynch,
let's
think
about
world
war
ii.
assume
that
president
roosevelt
had
reason
to
believe
that
one
of
his
personal
staff
members
who
was
conscientiously
opposed
to
any
war
was
leaking
information
with
respect
to
military
operations.
would
the
president's
efforts
to
locate
or
identify
that
individual
be
political,
as
i
think
your
argument
suggests,
or
would
they
be
in
connection
with
national
security
and
foreign
policy?
justice
jr.
so
the
purpose
could
shift,
even
though
it
started
out
quite
properly,
could
it?
