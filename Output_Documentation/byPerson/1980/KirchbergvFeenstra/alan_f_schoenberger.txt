mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
entitled
kirchberg
v.
feenstra,
is
a
case
that
has
gone
back
several
years,
and
i
would
like
to
review
some
of
the
facts
before
proceeding
into
argument.
in
1974,
mr.
karl
jean
kirchberg,
my
client,
decided
to
represent
harold
feenstra,
based
upon
charges
filed
by
mrs.
feenstra
against
mr.
feenstra
on
the
basis
of
crimes
against
nature.
my
client
accepted
a
mortgage
on
the
feenstra
household
based
upon
the
law
existing
at
that
time,
articles
2404
of
the
louisiana
civil
code,
and
articles
2334,
read
in
pari
materia.
thereafter,
mr.
harold
feenstra
did
not
pay
the
indebtedness
owed
to
mr.
kirchberg,
and
mr.
kirchberg,
proceeding
by
executory
process,
or
as
it's
called
in
the
civilian
phraseology,
the
law
of
louisiana,
via
executiva,
which
is
a
quick
seizure
and
sale,
proceeded
in
the
lower
courts
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
civil
district
court
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
yes,
sir.
mrs.
feenstra's
counsel
filed
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
what
we
call
a
tro,
and
finally
a
permanent
injunction.
and
they
claim,
of
course,
that
mr.
kirchberg
was
engaging
himself
as
a
creditor
and
money
lender
under
the
truth
in
lending
act.
mr.
kirchberg
thereafter
filed
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
and
the
case
was
allotted
to
the
hon.
judge
morey
sear,
and
at
that
time
he
prayed
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
he
had
not
violated
the
truth
in
lending
act,
and
that
issue
was
later
settled
and
compromised
agreeable
to
all
parties.
but
mrs.
feenstra,
lo
and
behold,
counterclaims.
in
her
counterclaim,
she
argues,
or
she
claimed,
that
article
2404,
louisiana
head
and
master
provision,
is
unconstitutional,
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
now
it
is
important
to
note
that
initially
there
was
some
discrepancy.
it
would
appear
from
the
record
that
the
original
counterclaim
was
to
article
2334,
was
the
article
which
was
unconstitutional.
however,
judge
morey
sear
evidently
felt
that
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
was
article
2404,
the
head
and
master
article.
thereafter,
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district,
mr.
kirchberg
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
saying
that
there
are
no
material
issues
of
fact,
that
indeed
he
should
be
able
to
proceed
via
executiva,
and
he
won
by
way
of
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
honorable
judge
sear,
looking
at
louisiana
law
and
looking
toward
this
honorable
court's
guidance
in
labine
v.
vincent
held
that
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
would
be
granted.
thereafter,
joan
feenstra
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
that
decision
the
holding
was
that
article
2404
was
unconstitutional,
and
the
decision
was
reversed,
but
applied
prospectively.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
we
do
not
believe
that
it
does,
your
honor,
and
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
problem.
having
laid
down
this
basic
structure
of
where
we
are
moving,
let
me--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--your
honor,
we
are
saying
that
if
the
decision
applies
it
is
purely
prospectively.
only
under
linkletter
does--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--your
honor,
it
says,
reversed,
applied
prospectively,
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
your
honor,
this
is
part
of
the
problem.
the
mortgage,
the
underlying
mortgage
was
executed
and
filed
on
october
22,
1974.
the
5th
circuit
never
said
that
the
underlying
mortgage
is
invalid.
it
only
said
that
article
2404
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
no,
no,
your
honor.
we
are
arguing
that
if
this
is
applied
purely
prospectively,
and
looks
to
the
future,
then
it
cannot
look
to
the
past,
and
it
cannot
look
to
1974,
when
karl
jean
kirchberg
relied
upon
the
civil
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
i...
this--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
your
honor,
this
was
one
possibility,
and
i
had
to
juggle
with
this
problem--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
your
honor,
it's...
and
the
other
way
in
which
i
have
viewed
this
particular
decision
is
that
maybe
it
does
apply
to
the
parties
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
but
since
it
looks
prospectively,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
mortgage
as
recorded
in
1974,
because...
and
this
is
the
important
point
to
note,
we
look
at
the
5th
circuit
language,
the
very
end
of
the
opinion.
it
says:
"we
reverse.
"
"we
apply
prospectively,
because
not
to
do
so
would
create
substantial
hardship
within
the
state
of
louisiana.
"
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
it
is
with
respect
to
the
mortgage,
your
honor,
but
the
situation
of
the
case
is
such
that
it
moved
up
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
indeed,
if
the
5th
circuit
is
making
any
sense...
and
indeed,
corpus
christi,
also
another
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
mentioned
the
substantial
hardship.
it
must
mean
that
mr.
kirchberg's
mortgage
is
valid
as
of
the
date
of
october,
1974,
because
if
it
is
not
then
we
do
have
that
substantial
hardship,
because
the
new
law
did
not
come
into
effect
till
january
1,
1980.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
we
have
six
years.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
the
relief
that
we
would
have
this
court
grant
is
that
article
2404
would
be
declared
constitutional,
and
that
mr.
karl
jean
kirchberg
could
proceed
via
executiva
to
have
the
feenstra
home
seized
and
sold.
this
would
be
the
relief
that
we
would
ask.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
the
other
way
of
proceeding
through
this.
having--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
well,
the
case
or
controversy
would
involve
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
between
mr.
kirchberg
and
joan
paillot
feenstra
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
article
2404.
i
realize
the
difficulties,
your
honors,
and
i've
thought
about
this
in
depth,
and
it
is
a
problem,
it
is
a
problem,
it's
a
serious
problem.
and
that
is
why
we
are
here,
and
that
is
why
i'm
addressing
the
three
issues
before
the
court.
maybe
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
proceed
first
with
the
issue
of
article
2404
as
it
is.
and
of
course,
beginning...
of
course
we
begin
with
the
private
law
of
louisiana
contained
therein
in
the
civil
code
of
our
state,
in
which
article
1
states
clearly,
"law
is
a
solemn
expression
of
legislative
will.
"
of
course,
the
law
of
stare
decisis
does
not
technically
apply
in
louisiana.
we
look
to
our
legislature
in
determining
in
true
civilian
fashion
as
is
done
in
quebec
and
is
applied
in
france
as
to
what
the
law
is.
we
come
to,
article
17
which
states
clearly,
"all
laws
are
to
be
read
in
pari
materia.
"
when
one
particular
provision
of
the
civil
code
of
louisiana
does
not
clearly
enunciate
the
law
or
if
it
enunciates
the
law
in
a
fashion
which
can
be
viewed
as
only
leading
to
one
principle,
we
look
to
the
other
code
articles
which
emanate
from
that
particular
system.
article
2404.
article
17
is
the
article
applying
to
the
in
pari
materia
rule
which
is
used
by
civilians
in
interpreting
a
law
in
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
the
law
would
be
what
this
honorable
court
would
say
the
law
is.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
what
the
constitution
is
and
how
this
honorable
court
would
interpret
the
constitution.
if
we
turn
to
article
2404,
we
read
that
the
husband
is
the
head
and
master
of
the
community.
he
manages
the
community,
he
disposes
of
its
assets.
we
read
this
in
pari
materia
with
article
2334
which
as
originally
enacted
in
1962...
and
this
is
the
provision
that
we
are
looking
at...
stated
that
the
husband
could
not
alienate
the
community
immovable
property
where
the
woman,
the
wife,
had
filed
a
declaration
of
homestead
in
the
mortgage
and
conveyance
office
where
the
parish,
where
the
property
was
situated.
2334
was
then
later
amended
in
1977
to
state
that
community
immovable
property
could
not
be
alienated
unless
the
wife
filed
a
declaration
stating
to
the
effect
that
her
consent
was
not
required.
so
we're
looking
at
earlier
article
2334,
valid
as
of
1962,
valid
until
january
1,
1977,
and
we're
looking
at
article
2404,
and
we
are
looking
at
this
law
and
we're
looking
at
october,
1977,
when
these
events
occurred.
and
this
is
the
system
of
law
which
is
applied
at
this
time.
in
my
brief,
your
honors,
we
have
attempted
to
point
out
the
unique
circumstances
of
louisiana
law,
we
have
pointed
to
the
fact
that
joan
paillot
feenstra
had
a
remedy
which
was
a
very,
very
easy
and
a
very
simple
remedy,
filing
the
declaration
of
homestead.
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
ignored
that
issue
and
immediately
jumped
to
the
fact
that
an
antenuptial
agreement
could
have
been
entered
into
between
the
parties
before
the
marriage
in
which
the
parties
would
be
separate
in
property
or
they
would
not
have
community
property,
or
that
the
husband
alone
could
not
mortgage
the
household.
and
they
go
into
the
point
of
transactional
cause
and
the
great
expense
of
retaining
an
attorney
before
entering
into
marriage
in
louisiana.
but
the
fact
is
that
no
attorney
was
ever
needed.
the
fact
is
that
no
antenuptial
agreement
was
ever
needed
to
remedy
the
situation.
we're
not
looking
at
$300,
$400,
$500,
although
i
do
not
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
amount
of
attorney's
fees.
all
we
are
looking
at
is
a
simple
declaration,
a
simple,
simple,
very
inexpensive
declaration
in
the
notarial
archives
of
orleans
parish
and
the
custodian,
of
the
records
stating
to
the
effect
that
this
community
house
cannot
be
alienated
or
mortgaged
by
my
husband
without
my
consent.
so
we
feel--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
your
honor,
we
of
course
first
address
the
issue
of
article
2404,
and
that
the
third
point
i
did
ask,
does
the
decision
apply
to
my
client
and
to
joan
paillot
feenstra
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
my
client
to
have
the
house
seized
and
sold,
or
does
it
not
mean
that?
and
my
feeling
was
that
that
issue
was
subsumed
within
the
issues
that
this
court
would
tell
us
what
prospectivity
means
in
this
particular
circumstance.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
did
not.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
that
there
is
no
case
or
controversy,
your
honor.
but
clearly,
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
because
the
mortgage
stands
in
orleans
parish
and
mr.
kirchberg,
due
to
the
injunctions,
cannot
seize
the
house,
and
the
house
is
encumbered.
so
we
stand
in
this
dilemma
of
a
house
that's
encumbered
with
a
mortgage,
without
an
order
saying
to
the
seneschal
of
the
parish
orleans,
you
are
notified
to
seize
this
particular
property,
advertise
it
for
sale,
and
to
sell
the
property.
and
we
stand
in
this
dilemma.
it's
a
dilemma
that
both
parties
face.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
maybe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
the
supreme
court,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
i
don't--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
your
honor,
not
in
a
situation
such
as
this.
they
would
probably
be
looking
to
this
court's
guidance,
in
terms
of
resolving
the
conflict.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
well,
your
honor--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
your
honor,
if
an
order
would
proceed
from
this
court
that
article
2404
is
constitutional,
then
clearly
the
house
can
be
seized
and
sold,
if
an
order
would
proceed.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
yes,
your
honor,
that
article--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
that
is
the
first
issue
in
our
statement
of
jurisdiction:
is
article
2404
unconstitutional?
and
we
believe
that
it
is
not.
if
we
were
looking
at
a
formal
antenuptial
agreement,
we
could
agree
that
the
situation
would
be
quite
burdensome.
but
considering
the
small
amount
of
fees,
of
filing
fees--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--yes,
your
honor,
except
that--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
i
felt
that
since
this
case
was
in
the
federal
system
that
it
should
more
up
appropriately
through
the
federal
system,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
well,
your
honor,
what
we
are
saying--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
with
the
injunction,
your
honor,
no;
that
is
part
of
the
problem.
and
we
do
not
feel
that
the
5th
circuit
opinion
is
clear,
and
that
is
why
we
appealed
the
case.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
but
it
did
not
say
that.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
except,
your
honor,
that
according
to
linkletter
the
federal
courts
can
apply
cases
prospectively
only,
future
prospectivity
there
is
nothing--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--there
is
no
direct
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
case
was
decided
in
our
favor,
and
there
is
no
statement
to
the
effect
that
it
was
decided
exactly
in
favor
of
mrs.
feenstra.
there
was
no
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
mortgage
was
invalid
or
that
the
mortgage--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--unless,
your
honor,
as
i
feel,
that
it
was
decided
in
our
favor
and
looked
toward
the
future
from
the
date
of
december
12,
1979,
on,
and
that
the
prior
mortgage
was
valid,
because
if
it
were
not
valid
then
we
would
be
in
substantial
chaos
in
louisiana,
because
the
law
of
the
case
could
not
apply
to
mr.
kirchberg
alone--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--because
that
would
be
unfair.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
because
if
it
applies
to
mr.
kirchberg
under
mcduffy
v.
weil,
all
mortgages
in
louisiana
are
only
valid
from
the
date
of
recordation
and
filing,
and
therefore,
if
the
law
of
the
5th
circuit
is
that
article...
well,
obviously,
the
2404
is
unconstitutional.
and
if
it
applies
to
mr.
kirchberg,
it
applies
from
1974
or.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
that
was
reversed.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
it
would
follow,
your
honor,
that
it
was
a
reversal
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and...
but
in
terms
of
application,
of
that
judgment,
that
is
another
problem.
and
from
what
date,
and
in
what
circumstances
would
that
apply,
is
again
unknown.
if
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
not
said
to
apply
this
case
would
cause
substantial
hardship,
if
applied
retrospectively,
citing
cipriano
v.
city
of
houma,
the
case
involving
the
property
bond
voting
restrictions
to
people
who
did
not
own
property,
then
it
would
be
much
more
clear.
your
honor,
we
would--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--he
did
cite
the
case.
he
did
cite
the
case,
your
honor,
but
then
he
said
he
would--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--she;
yes.
your
honor,
we
will
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
your
honor,
we
received
the
original
opinion
and
we
duplicated
that
opinion,
the
slip
decision,
and
then
we
proceeded
to
copy
the
further
west
opinion
also.
so
that
there
would
be
all
decisions
before
the
court,
because
we
want
the
court
to
have
all
the
relevant
cases.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
there
isn't,
your
honor,
but
we
just
felt
that
we
should
follow--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
we--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--it
just
said--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--reversed,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
okay.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
we
would
probably
have--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--well,
no,
your
honor,
but
there
would
have
been
a
controversy
as
to
the
enforcement
of
the
mortgage,
and
i
imagine
we
would
have
had
to
appeal
through
the
federal
system
again,
another
time.
okay.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
a
few
brief
comments.
i
would
first
like
to
say
that
in
terms
of
my
client's
reliance
upon
the
law,
we
would
point
out
that
article
2404
was
valid
in
1974
and
we
would
say
there
was
no
other
law
to
rely
upon,
and
he
relied
upon
the
law
at
that
time,
when
these
acts
were
executed.
we
would
also
say
that
in
terms
of--
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
--right,
right.
but...
yes.
and,
your
honor,
we
would
also
say
that
this
decision
would
have
effects
potentially
damaging.
a
wife,
under
kirchberg
v.
feenstra,
the
5th
circuit
holding,
could
renounce
payment
on
mortgages
executed
by
the
husband
alone,
so
creditors
under
this
holding
would
be
prejudiced
by
the
holding.
so
we
do
have
problems,
and
we
do
have
the
problem
that
the
mortgage
was
executed
in
1974
and
if
an
order
should
proceed
from
this
court
cancelling
the
inscription
of
the
mortgage,
the
mortgage
would
have
to
be
cancelled
as
it
would
relate
back
to
the
date
of
october,
1974,
and
therefore
all
the
other
mortgages
similarly
situated
after
october,
1974,
would
be
affected
by
this
holding.
mr.
alan
f.
schoenberger
well,
your
honor,
we
did
not
feel
that
it
was
in
fraud
of
the
interest
of
the
wife.
