ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellant
kirchberg
in
this
case
has
apparently
confused
what
is
a
very
simple
case
before
this
court,
and
that
is
whether
article
2404
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
whether
the
5th
circuit
lower
court
opinion
should
be
applied
to
the
parties
litigant.
it
was
not
until
the
appeal
to
this
court
that
the
issue
of
whether
ms.
feenstra
should
be
included
in
the
holding
of...
an
unconstitutional
holding
of
the
article
24
has
been
raised,
and
it
was
raised
by
mr.
kirchberg
as
an
11th
hour
attempt
to
save
his
mortgage.
at
the
court
below,
at
the
district
court,
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
governor
of
louisiana
was
included
as
a
defendant
in
ms.
feenstra's
counterclaim.
they
prepared
a
brief
to
the
5th
circuit
on
appeal
which
stated,
if
the
5th
circuit
holds
article
2404
unconstitutional
and
if
it
applies
its
decision
prospectively
only,
then
mrs.
feenstra
would
be
the
only
person
who
would
benefit
from
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
therefore,
the
state
of
louisiana
and
ms.
feenstra
were
in
agreement
at
that
point
that
a
prospective-only
ruling
should
include
the
parties
before
the
court.
mr.
kirchberg--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--an
unconstitutional
holding
that
article
2404
would
apply
to
the
parties
litigant.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
exactly.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
exactly.
and
at
no
time--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
and
the
5th
circuit
went
to
a
great
effort.
half
of
its
opinion
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
case
or
controversy
before
them,
and
then
to
hold
that
the
decision
should
not
be
applied
to
ms.
feenstra
would
be
absolute,
an
advisory
opinion.
this
is
especially
so
since
article
2404
has
been
repealed
and
after
january
1,
1980,
does
not,
there
is
no
longer
head
and
master,
in
louisiana
and
no
such
mortgages
with
just
the
husband's
signature
can
be
allowed
to
stand.
therefore,
any--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
those
executed
after
1980.
but
in
practicality,
ms.
feenstra
is
the
only
person
with
a
home
that
stands
to
lose
at
this
point.
since
1977,
january
1,
1977,
the
louisiana
legislature
amended
article
2334,
under
which
a
husband
would
be
no
longer
able
to
mortgage
without
his
wife's
consent.
and
therefore
any
mortgages
signed
after
1977
on
property
held
in
names
of
both
spouses
could
not
be
mortgaged
or
alienated
merely
by
the
husband's
signature
only.
so,
in
practicality,
this
is
not
a
problem.
there
is
no
economic
chaos
in
the
state
of
louisiana
at
this
time
because
of
an
unconstitutional
holding.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
there
is
in
no
sense
a
holding,
or
as
ms.
feenstra
is
seeking
to
have
held,
that
the
community
property
system
is
unconstitutional.
she
is
merely
speaking
about
the
head
and
master
managerial
powers
over
the
community
property,
the
real
community
property
of
parties.
and
louisiana
is
the
only
community
property
state
that
has
such
a
provision
in
its
legislation.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
my
understanding
is
that
louisiana
is
at
this
point,
was...
in
1976
when
this
lawsuit
was
brought,
was
the
only
state
with
that
kind
of
provision,
but
i
certainly
may
be
incorrect,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
a
holding,
prospective-only
holding
in
this
case
would
also
go
against
the
holdings
in
prospective
cases
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
corpus
christi
parish
credit
union
v.
martin
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
but
in
a
three-justice
dissent
they
clearly
said
that
article
2404
had
to
be
found
constitutional,
that
it
should
be
applied
prospective
only,
because
of
the
subsequent
inequity
that
could
result
from
a
retroactive
holding,
but
that
of
course
the
parties
before
them
should
be
included
in
that.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
that
was
the
three-justice
dissent
in
corpus
christi,
your
honor,
and
it
is
the
only
case
law
where
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
grappled
with
an
unconstitutional
holding
of
article
2404
and
come
up
with
a
solution
as
far
as
application
to
the
parties,
or
retroactive
application.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
that
is
correct.
but
in
lake,
inc.,
v.
louisiana
power
&
light,
330
so.2d
914,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
hold,
make
a
prospective-only
decision
and
specifically
included
the
parties
before
the
case.
so
they
have
spoken
on
prospective-only
and
have
shown
their
intention
to
keep
the
parties
before
them.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
absolutely,
and
a
case
in
controversy
is
at
the
basis
of
the
appellee's
claim
that
she
has
included
in
the
5th
circuit.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
appellee's
motion
for
affirmance
before
this
court,
in
the
appeal
before
this
court,
appellee
pointed
out
that
the
5th
circuit
was
empowered
to
decide
whether
its
holding
prospective-only
applied
to
the
parties
litigant,
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
appeal
to
come
before
this
court
on
that
issue.
i'd
also
like
to
speak
to
a
point
made
by
mr.
kirchberg's
attorney
that
he
relied
on
article
2404
to
his
detriment.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
give
evidence
of
his
reliance.
he
received
a
note
signed
by
mr.
feenstra
in
october,
1974,
on
a
debt
of
$3,000,
and
five
days
later
he
returned
to
prison
where
mr.
feenstra
was
and
got
him
to
sign
the
mortgage.
i'm
sure
mr.
kirchberg
was
aware
at
this
time
there
would
be
no
way
in
which
mrs.
feenstra
would
agree
to
such
a
mortgage
and
therefore
he
was
merely
trying
to
cover
his
options.
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
was
relying
on
it.
he
also
was
an
attorney
and
practicing
for
several
years
in
domestic
relations
work,
and
he
was
in
process
of
this
kind
of
work
at
the
time
that
labine
and
frontiero
were
decided,
so
he
should
have
been
aware
of
those
holdings.
furthermore,
in
practice,
there
are
no
other
cases
of
this
type
pending,
and
no
other
mortgages
known
to
be
foreclosed
in
louisiana.
the
state
of--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--well,
as
i
stated
before,
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
and
i
doubt
that
any
could
be,
because
i
did
not
believe
that
they
were
able
to
have
the
husband
alienating
community
property
without
the
wife's
consent,
as
louisiana
did.
further,
there's...
the
state
of
louisiana
was
my
opposing
counsel
below
at
the
5th
circuit;
however,
they
chose
not
to
appeal
this
decision.
and
their
conspicuous
absence
in
this
appeal
would
point
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
that
an
unconstitutional
holding,
in
particular
to
mrs.
feenstra
and
the
mortgage
on
her
home,
would
cause
chaos
in
the
commercial
transactions
of
louisiana.
obviously,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
deemed
its
citizens
secure
and
the
code
secure,
and
has
failed
to
join
mr.
kirchberg
in
his
appeal.
in
fact
they
had
moved
to
dismiss
on
those
grounds
and
they
moved
as
appellees.
so
they
are,
at
this
stage
of
the
appeal,
joint
appellees.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
yes,
which
was...
well,
they'd
moved
to
dismiss
as
moot,
but
they
also
made
much
of...
their
motion
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
a
case
or
controversy
below,
and
now
they
find
that
the
repeal
of
the
head
and
master
statutes,
article
2404,
in
their
opinion
that
was
moot.
but,
it
was
incorrectly
so
because
any
mortgage
signed
after
january
1,
1980,
would
be
affected,
but
not
mrs.
feenstra's
mortgage,
so
there's
definitely
a
live
controversy,
case
in
controversy
before
this
court--
but
in
their
motion
to
dismiss
they
made
a
point
that
the
5th
circuit
could
reopen
its
mandate
and
determine
what
they
meant
by
a
prospective-only
holding.
this
court
has
continually
in
article
iii
cases
recognized
the
power
of
finding,
making
a
decision
prospective
only,
but
in
all
times
where
an
article
iii
case
in
controversy
was
presented
the
decision
applied
to
the
parties
litigant,
and
i
think
this
is
agreed
upon
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
as
to
appellant
kirchberg's
contention
that
there
is
no
need
to
reach
the
issue
of
unconstitutionality
because
of
mrs.
feenstra's
ability
to
file
a
declaration
of
homestead,
this
was
a
very
serious
burden
imposed
upon
married
women
in
louisiana,
and
under
the
statute
this
declaration
was
only
allowed
to
be
made
six
months
after
the
property
was
purchased
by
the
wife.
the
statute
provided--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--after
the
first
six
months.
the
first
six
months
after
the
property
was
purchased
the
state
of
louisiana
left
those
six
months
for
the
husband
to
file
a
declaration
of
family
homestead,
but
if
he
neglected
to
within
those
six
months
then
they
empowered
the
wife,
so
potentially
a
husband
can
mortgage
the
property
without
his
wife's
consent
and
the
declaration
would
be
useless
to
her
if
it
was
done
within
the
first
six
months
after
purchase.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
an
antenuptial
agreement
was
possible
under
louisiana
law,
but
appellee
feenstra
would
maintain
that
at
all
points
that
that
was
not,
did
not
cure
the
burdens
on
her;
that
an
antenuptial
contract
would
have
to
be
signed
by
both
the
parties,
and
a
husband
therefore
would
have
to
give
up,
be
required
to
give
up
the
power
that
louisiana
had
given
him
under
the
head
and
master
principle.
and
this
is...
the
wife
would
be
seeking
an
antenuptial
agreement
under...
it's
definitely
an
unequal
bargaining
position.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
i
suppose;
yes.
--but
this
declaration
merely
enhances
and
buttresses
the
fact
that
mrs.
feenstra
has
been
discriminated
against
and
her
rights
of
equal
protection
have
been
violated.
under
louisiana
law
as
it
applied
to
her,
the
burdens
were
all
on
her
to
cure
a
basically
unequal
law,
and
in
no
sense,
no
matter
what
she
did,
would
she
ever
be
able
to
proceed
in
the
power
that
her
husband
had
under
head
and
master,
and
that
would
be
having
total
authority
and
managerial
authority
over
the
community
property;
no
matter
what
she
did
would
she
be
able
to
be
in
that...
stand
in
that
position.
appellee
seems
to
have
not
created
her
own
predicament;
the
state
of
louisiana
has
by
choosing
for
her
a
system
under
which
she
has
no
managerial
rights
over
her
own
property.
article
2404
would
force
her
to
relinquish
all
of
her
contribution.
the
basis
of
community
property
is
that
a
husband
and
wife
contribute
equally
to
the
marriage
and
therefore
own
jointly
all
the
assets
of
that
community.
yet
article
2404
only
gives
the
wife
an
imperfect
ownership
right
in
her
own
property
and
gives
the
husband
a
perfect
right
over
the
entire,
her
half
and
his
half.
and
it
is
not
until
the
marriage
is
dissolved
or
his
death
that
she
would
be
able
to
sue
for
fraud
or
to
gain
her
ownership
rights
if
no
fraud
was
committed
or
if
the
assets
were
not
structured.
by
the
louisiana
system
of
choosing
management
by
the
husband
alone,
it
is
definitely
calling
for
a
different
treatment
of
otherwise
similarly
situated
married
persons,
and
this
different
treatment
is
based
on
sex.
it
is
impossible
to
view
the
article
in
any
other
terms
but
a
denial
of
her
equal
protection.
the
opt-out
provisions,
the
antenuptial
contract,
the
declarations
that
were
made,
are
all
forms
in
which
she
the
wife
must,
has
the
burden
of
correcting
a
definitely
inequitable
situation,
yet
the
husband
never
has
that
burden.
the
ability
of
mrs.
feenstra
to
declare
a
family
home
was
not
made
light
by
the
5th
circuit.
they
merely
pointed
out
that
she
would
have
an
additional
economic
and
legal
burden
and
the
transactional
costs
added
to
the
wife
and
not
being
added
to
the
husband
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
there
is
no
declaration
or
contract
under
this
louisiana
head-and-master
system
which
could
ever
give
the
wife
a
favorable
position
of
managerial
control.
i
would
like
to
add
that
the
power
of
the
wife
to
renounce
the
community
under
article
2410
which
was
presented
as
a
balance
to
the
head
and
master
system
is
not
a
balance,
that
the
code
was
not
balanced
equally
and
it
is
balanced
inequitably
against
the
wife.
the
wife
had
all
the
disadvantages
and
none
of
the
advantages
over
her
property.
under
article
2410
the
wife
has
the
right
to
renounce
at
the
dissolution
of
a
marriage
if
her
husband
has
run
up
debts
that
exceed
the
assets
of
the
community.
now,
how
such
a
article
can
be
conceived
to
balance
the
head
and
master
system
against
her
is
unbelievable
to
me.
fortunately,
this
is
also
repealed
and
now,
in
louisiana,
there
is
a
strong
community
property
system,
a
healthy,
live
community
property
system,
but
without
the
discriminatory
provisions.
the
louisiana
legislature
in
its
wisdom
has
adopted
a
gender-neutral
system
where
both
husbands
and
wives
manage
equally
their
property
and
have
avoided,
and
have
chosen
the
least
discriminatory
manner
possible
of
regulating
marital
property
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties.
and
therefore
there
is
really
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
situation
of
havoc
or
that
the
code
has
been
harmed
or
is
unhealthy
situation
at
this
point.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
the
state
of
louisiana
was
enforcing
by
the
mortgage
an
unconstitutional--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--yes.
and
that
the
marriage
be
declared
null
and
void.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
below
in
the
5th
circuit;
yes.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
there
is
really
none
at
this
time.
the
state
is
in
agreement,
apparently
by
their
failure
to
appeal
the
unconstitutional
holding
below
that
the
state--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--absolutely.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
yes,
with
respect
to
any
other
mortgage
signed--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
well,
it
might
not,
but
fortunately
that
has
all
been
solved
by
the
repeal
of
that
act
as
of
january
1,
1980.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
that
also
includes
movables
too,
and
that
is
something
that
is
totally
out
of
the
realm
of
what
the
5th
circuit
decision
on
articles...
what
they
declared
as
unconstitutional.
so
i
suppose
they
declared
the
entire
article
unconstitutional.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
that's
true;
so--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--yes;
a
mortgage
on
property
held
in
both
their
names,
community
property,
or
of
property
held
in
the
name
of
one
spouse
would
have
to
be
signed
by
both
parties.
in
effect
that--
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
--yes.
community
property;
that
only
refers
to
community
property.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
question
that
justice
blackmun
asked
of
my
opposing
counsel,
and
that
was,
why
the
5th
circuit
made
two
separate
decisions
that
look
exactly
the
same?
there
is
one
footnote
in
the
second
decision
that
was
added.
their
opinion
was
originally
amended
and
that
footnote
concerned
the
decision
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
corpus
christi,
and
that's
why
it
was
the
necessity
of
including
both
decisions
in
there.
they
are
not
exactly
the
same.
i
would
like
to
conclude
just
on
the
idea
that
understanding
the
facts
in
this
case
are
really
understanding
how
the
law
discriminates
against
women
in
louisiana.
and
mrs.
feenstra
filed
criminal
charges
against
her
husband
to
avoid
his
further
molestation
of
her
child.
she
was
merely
protecting
her
family
and
her
own
daughter
from
her
husband.
ms.
barbara
hausman-smith
it
has
to
do
with
it
in
the
fact
that
it
enhances
the
actual
discrimination
against
her,
because
mr.
kirchberg
is
asking
that
louisiana
enforce
the
mortgage
under
which
she
would
lose
her
home
for
no
other
reason
than
her
opposition
to
the
party
that's
seeking
the
mortgage.
those
are
legal
fees
performed
by
mr.
kirchberg,
that
is
the
separation
and
the
so-called
representation
in
the
criminal
charges
were
in
direct
opposition
to
her
interests,
and
yet
she
is
the
one
that
stands
to
lose
from
this.
thank
you.
