justice
stewart
they
decided
the
case.
and
a
federal,
any
federal
court,
including
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
has
to
decide
cases
before
it,
one
way
or
the
other.
and
it
can't
give
advisory
opinions,
and
it's
the
very
fact
it
decided
the
case
leads
to
the
inference,
i
suppose,
i
would
suppose,
that
my
brother
rehnquist
has
suggested,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
even
if
we
can
do
it
prospectively
only,
linkletter
didn't
say
that.
but
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean.
but
in
any
event,
a
court
always
decides
the
case
before
it
in
favor
of
one
party
or
the
other,
and
there's
no
indication
here
that
the
court
decided
this
case
in
your
favor,
is
there?
justice
stewart
well,
it
was
either
decided
against
you
or
it
wasn't
decided
at
all,
wasn't
it,
in
your
case?
justice
stewart
why
not?
justice
stewart
why?
justice
stewart
she
did,
isn't
it
a
she?
justice
stewart
and
since
january
1,
1980,
under
the
then
and
now-existing
statutes
of
louisiana,
a
mortgage
such
as
that
involved
in
this
case
would
have
had
to
have
been
signed
by
a
husband
and
wife,
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
if
the
property
had
been
acquired
during
the
marriage?
