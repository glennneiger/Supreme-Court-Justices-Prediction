the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
solve
all
of
that
dilemma?
justice

of
louisiana,
solve
all
of
your
dilemma?
justice
marshall
don't
you
have
any
title-clearing
cases
down

clear
title
down
there?
clear
the
title?
justice
marshall
we
would
give
them
guidance
in
how
to
enforce
their,
own
statutes?
justice
marshall
we
would
give
them
guidance
in
how
to
clear
up
a
case?
justice
marshall
that's
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
marshall
i
just
wondered
what
you
wanted
us
to
do.
justice
marshall
but
the
judge
did
cite
that
case.
justice
marshall
but
these
are
just
counterclaims
you've
filed.
the
original
action
was
by
the
appellant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
circuit
court
of
the
fifth
circuit.
in
this
case,
we
consider
rather
a
new
--
and
now
superseded
louisiana
statute
which
gave
the
husband
a
unilateral
power
to
dispose
a
community
property
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
his
wife
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
this
statute
allowed
appellee's
husband
to
execute
a
mortgage
in
favor
of
appellant
on
the
home
he
jointly
owned
with
appellee.
when
the
appellant
attempted
to
foreclose
on
the
mortgage
and
evict
the
appellee,
she
brought
this
challenge
to
the
federal
court
to
the
validity
of
the
mortgage
and
on
the
ground
that
it
was
executed
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
unconstitutionally
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
sex.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
in
favor
of
the
appellee,
finding
the
louisiana
statute
unconstitutional
and
the
mortgage
invalid.
appellant
then
appealed
to
this
court,
the
reasons
for
our
decision
are
more
fully
set
out
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
would
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
hold
it
under
our
decisions.
when
a
statute
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
sex,
the
burden
rests
on
the
party
defending
the
statute
to
show
that
it's
substantially
furthers
an
important
governmental
objective.
because
the
appellant
failed
to
carry
this
burden,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
this
fifth
circuit
in
validating
the
louisiana
statute
and
the
mortgage
executed
pursuant
to
it.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
in
which
justice
rehnquist
joined.
