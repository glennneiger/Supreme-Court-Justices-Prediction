justice
rehnquist
but
then
there's
no
case
or
controversy,
no
live
case
or
controversy,
it's
just
purely
a
decision
of
an
abstract
proposition
which
doesn't
have
any
effect
on
concrete
rights
of
the
parties.
justice
rehnquist
but
to
say
that
it
applies
to
the
parties
but
not
to
the
mortgage
is
really
kind
of
a
conundrum
because
the
only
controversy
between
the
parties
is
with
respect
to
the
mortgage,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
what
relief
do
you
want
here?
justice
rehnquist
what
relief
do
you
want
here?
justice
rehnquist
but
then,
what
controversy
would
the
court
of
appeals
have
adjudicated
within
the--
--we
would
then
dismiss
the
appeal,
i
suppose,
as
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
want
us
to
apply
that
rule
to
our
constitution?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
5th
circuit
had
said
that
at
least
as
between
you
and
your
opponent,
the
mortgage
was
invalid.
justice
rehnquist
ms.
hausman-smith,
hasn't
there
always
been
kind
of
an
uneasiness
with
the
case
in
controversy
requirement
about
this
court's
retroactivity
holdings,
and
prospective-only
holdings?
you
have
to
have
a
concrete
case
or
controversy
and
yet
you
want
to
avoid
undue
hardship
to
people
who
have
relied
on
preexisting
law.
justice
rehnquist
but
louisiana
is
not
the
only
state
that
operates
under
a
community
property
system.
the
other
states
that
have
community
property
systems
are
in
other
federal
circuits,
so
that
there...
it's
by
no
means
a
symmetrical
result
as
if
the
5th
circuit
were
the
only
court
that
were
ever
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
type
of
statute
and
declare
it
unconstitutional
but
prospective
only.
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
law
may
have
changed
since
i
practised
in
arizona
but
arizona
had
a
community
property
statute
where
the
husband
could
alienate
property
on
his
own
signature
unless
it
was
in
fraud
of
the
rights
of
the
wife.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
may--
justice
rehnquist
of
course
they
may
not
have
the
same
case
or
controversy
requirements
that
the
federal
judicial
system
has.
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
other
community
property
states
though
that
are
in
the
9th
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
actually,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
moved
to
dismiss
as
moot,
hasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
an
antenuptial
agreement?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
an
antenuptial
agreement,
she
can
refuse
to
marry
him,
i
suppose.
justice
rehnquist
counsel,
how
about
the
second
paragraph
of
what
used
to
be
article
2404
where
it
describes
the
role
of
the
husband
in
marriage,
and
where
it
says
he
can
make
no
conveyance
inter
vivos
by
a
gratuitous
title
of
the
immovables
of
the
community?
that
would
sound
to
me
not
to
fall
within
the
proscription
of
the
5th
circuit's
reasoning.
justice
rehnquist
but
we
still
have
the
problem
of
the
time
between
the
handing
down
of
the
5th
circuit's
decision
and
the
adoption
of
the
new
system
on
january
1.
justice
rehnquist
it's
on
page
a42
of
the
statement
of
jurisdiction.
justice
rehnquist
but
actually,
as
to
the
immovables,
the
statute
already
proscribed
them.
