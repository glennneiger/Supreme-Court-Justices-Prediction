e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
the
case
of
kirchberg
v.
feenstra.
mr.
schoenberger,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
foreclosure
in
any
other
state,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
couldn't
you...
i'll
put
it
this
way,
could
you
have
just
simply
commenced
your
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
the
5th
circuit
meant
what
it
seemed
to
have
said,
that
this
was
prospective
only,
and
then
let
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
wrestle
with
that
problem?
chief
justice
burger
what
was
there
to
prevent
you
from
doing
that
after
the
5th
circuit
came
down?
chief
justice
burger
you're
asking
us
to
clarify
something
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
clear
to
you
and
that's
what
it
amounts
to,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
you
come
to
us
without
knowing
whether,
what
the
louisiana
courts
would
have
done
or
whether
you
could
have
proceeded
with
this
foreclosure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
hausman-smith.
chief
justice
burger
any
of
them,
or
those
executed
after
1980?
chief
justice
burger
within
the
first
six
months
or
after
the
first
six
months?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
schoenberger?
you
have
a
couple
of
minutes
left.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
5th
circuit
acknowledged
that,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
kirchberg
against
feenstra
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
