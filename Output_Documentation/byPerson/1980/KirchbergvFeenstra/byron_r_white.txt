justice
white
to
whom?
do
you
think
it
applied
to
the
parties,
or
not?
justice
white
well,
if
you
didn't
think
it
applied
to
you,
why
did
you
appeal?
why
did
you
come
here
at
all
if
you
didn't
think
that--
justice
white
--well,
does
it
apply
to
your
client
or
doesn't
it?
justice
white
you
just
told
me
you
didn't
think
it
applied
to
your
client.
justice
white
well,
what
is...
so,
you
want
to
come
up
here
to
have
us
declare
your
mortgage
invalid?
justice
white
--i
suppose
one
of
your
questions,
if
you
want
to
ask
back,
is
why
did
we
ever
grant
it?
justice
white
you'd
be
just
as
happy,
i
suppose,
if
you
had
a
ruling
that
whatever
the
court
of
appeals
said
didn't
invalidate
your
mortgage?
justice
white
and
if
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
as
not
invalidating
your
mortgage,
you'd
be
very
happy.
justice
white
no,
it
said...
it
says,
"and
we
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
"
justice
white
so
on
the
remand,
what
would
have
happened?
if
you
hadn't
have
come
here?
justice
white
had
trouble
enforcing
your
mortgage,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean,
include
them?
what
would
include
them?
justice
white
but
not
to
other--
justice
white
--other
people
who
had
made
mortgages
before?
justice
white
so
it's
not
a
ruling
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court?
justice
white
what
was
your
claim
against
the
state
of
louisiana?
justice
white
so
you
asked
that
there
be,
that
the
provision
be
declared
unconstitutional
and
the
state
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
it?
justice
white
and
what
do
you
think
is
left
of...
you
won
your
case,
didn't
you?
justice
white
and
what
do
you
think...
what
relief
against
the
state
is
left
after
its
prospective
ruling?
justice
white
i
would
say
that,
isn't
your
position
that
the
state
is
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
provision
with
respect
to
your
mortgage?
justice
white
but
it
is
not
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
provision
with
respect
to
any
other
mortgage?
