justice
blackmun
isn't
your
relief
really
one
directed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
clarification
of
its
judgment
rather
than
here?
justice
blackmun
did
you
ask
the
5th
circuit
for
clarification
of
its
judgment?
justice
blackmun
so
both
of
you
come
up
here
not
knowing
what
the
judgment
means.
and
this
is
the
gist
of
the
state
of
louisiana's
motion
to
dismiss,
as
i
read
it.
justice
blackmun
well,
if
you
got
together,
you
could
sell
it.
justice
blackmun
well,
counsel,
at
least,
however,
you
prevailed
in
the
district
court
before
judge
sear?
justice
blackmun
and
that
was
reversed?
justice
blackmun
does
it
follow
that
that's
a
decision
against
your
client?
justice
blackmun
before
you
sit
down,
counsel,
the
statement
of
jurisdiction,
which
was
prepared
by
your
client
has
what
looks
to
me
like
a
duplication
of
the
5th
circuit's
opinion.
justice
blackmun
is
that
a
correct
duplication
or
does
one
take
precedence
over
the
other?
justice
blackmun
well,
is
there
a
distinction
between
the
two
opinions?
justice
blackmun
but
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
remand,
wasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
reversed
the
proceedings.
justice
blackmun
--did
you
say
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion?
