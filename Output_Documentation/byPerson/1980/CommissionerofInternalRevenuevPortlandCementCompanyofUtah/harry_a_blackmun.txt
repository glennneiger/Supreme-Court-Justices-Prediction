justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
--
mr.
smith,
if
the
court
below
it
agreed
with
you
that
the
first
marketable
product
was
both
bulk
and
bagged
cement,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
have
excluded
any
cost
from
the
denominator.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know,
but
it
--
it
said
that
the
first
marketable
product
was
bulk
cement.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
this
event,
you
should
throw
out
some
costs
from
the
denominator.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
your
first
question,
if
you
went
on
the
first
question,
you
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
there's
no
suggestion
that
they
would
throw
those
costs
out
of
the
denominator
even
if
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
even
if
the
first
marketable
product
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
was
bagged
cement.
