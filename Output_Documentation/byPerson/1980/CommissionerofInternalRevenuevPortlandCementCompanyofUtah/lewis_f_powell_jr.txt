justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
a
case
involving
a
rather
technical
question
of
federal
taxation.
it
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
respondent
is
an
integrated
miner
and
manufacturer
of
cement
with
a
mining
plants
in
utah.
the
question
presented
involves
the
applicability
of
an
equation.
one
used
to
determine
the
proper
depletion,
deduction
allowable
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
were
asked
to
decide
which
of
respondent's
products
in
the
combined
mining,
manufacturing
operations
was
the
first
marketable
product
for
purposes
of
the
equation.
there
is
a
flat
conflict
among
the
circuits
on
this
question.
as
an
oral
summary
of
our
opinion
in
this
tax
case
would
highly
be
enlightening.
i
will
simply
say
that
for
the
reasons
stated
at
some
length
in
the
opinion
filed
this
morning,
we
agree
anonymously
with
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
