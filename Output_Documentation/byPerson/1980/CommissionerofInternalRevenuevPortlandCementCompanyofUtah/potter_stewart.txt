now,
the
two
questions
are
separate.
they're
--
they're
interrelated,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
they
have
to
kind
of
be
answered
the
same
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
consistently.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
exactly.
no.

(inaudible)
justice

on
the
tax
--
this
tax
return,
did
the
taxpayer
--
or
with
respect
to
gross
sales
cost,
on
--
an
office
administrative
cost,
did
the
taxpayer
seek
to
exclude
them
entirely
or
to
place
some
of
them
in
the
numerator?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
tax
take
--
take
a
different
position
on
that
that
it
did
in
the
court
below?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
to
echo
my
brother
blackmun's
question,
what
if
your
client
sold
all
of
the
cement
in
bags
and
always
had
and
always
will?
justice
potter
stewart
bagging
would
clearly
be
part
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
however,
if
a
competitor
sold
all
of
cement
in
bulk?the
--
the
difference
of
the
mined
product
would
be
different
between
the
two
companies,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
being
identical
product.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
different
from,
say,
you
have
three
or
four
methods
of
sales,
some
you
sell
through
distributors
and
some
on
commission
and
some
through
door-to-door
salesmen,
and
there
are
different
sales
costs
per
10%
of
your
business
and
another
20
and
another
50,
but
it's
still
all
cement
would
use
--
and
--
and
as
those
proportions
vary
from
year
to
year,
the
value
of
the
--
of
the
mined
product
would
also
vary
from
year
to
year,
as
i
suppose.
would
you
say
that
nevertheless,
those
are
--
would
you
say
that's
all
one
marketable
product
or
does
it
--
does
it
change
from
time
to
time?
same
as
none
of
them
was
in
bags
but
some
of
it
was
sold
in
smaller
quantities
at
somewhat
different
prices
because
of
different
sales
techniques.
how
is
that
any
different
than
the
--
the
bagging
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
leaving
out
transportation
because
i'm
just
focusing
on
sales
costs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
exactly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
like
--
like
they
say
the
bags
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
allocated
to
both,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
that
goes
into
the
total
figure,
doesn't
it?
just
as
the
sales
costs
go
into
the
total
figure.
and
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
in
the
general
sales
manager.
how
--
what
is
the
--
to
his
salary?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you
did
in
your
tax
return?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes
or
no,
did
you
or
did
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
that
in
itself
is
something
of
a
fiction.
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
point
is
that
this
taxpayer
elected
to
