mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
seems
to
have
been
cast
in
terms
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
a
mathematical,
automatically
functioning
formula,
rather
than
in
terms
of
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
purpose
for
which
that
formula
is
being
applied.
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
is
to
ascertain
an
integrated
miner's
gross
income
from
mining.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
bulk
cement.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
and
bulk
cement
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
not
really.
that
is
--
that
is
the
product
that
is
sold
in
a
substantial
quantity.
and
indeed,
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
correctly
recognized,
bagging
is
something
that
occurs
additionally
and
it
has
a
discrete
income
component.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
it
is
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
i
do
not
agree
with
mr.
smith.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
no,
there
are
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
i
certainly
do
because
bulk
cement
is
sold
in
significant
quantities.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
indeed,
approximately
95%
in
bulk.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
it
is
the
first
product
reached.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
no,
it
would
not
because
you
have
to
have
sufficient
sales
to
establish
the
price
so
that
you
have
a
--
a
meaningful
first
marketable
product.
just
as
in
the
case
of
a
representative
field
price
at
--
where
the
product
is
sold
after
mining
ends.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
cases
in
the
depletion
area
under
the
representative
market
or
field
price
generally
are
found
at
10%,
15%,
20%.
it
has
to
be
determined
with
reference
to
the
realities
of
the
market.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
sales
figures
should
include
the
gross
sales
of
bulk
cement
and
the
sales
value
of
the
cement
which
is
sold
in
bags
because
that
also
is
the
product
of
cement
rock
which
was
mined
by
the
taxpayer
and
manufactured
into
finished
cement.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
you
have
to
include
an
income
figure
for
cement
sold
in
bags
and
the
proportionate
profit
formula
contemplates
this
because
it
takes
actual
sales
of
the
first
marketable
product,
sales
of
cement
in
bulk
and
with
respect
to
products
that
are
second
or
third,
they
further
processed
or
product
after
first
marketable
product,
they
take
a
constructed
sales
value
derived
from
the
sales
value
applied
to
the
first
marketable
product.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
it
is
the
activity
of
putting
it
into
a
bag,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
not
in
the
sense
usually
used
in
the
depletion
area,
it
is
not.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
taxpayer
took
the
--
what
is
the
less
favorable
position,
namely,
less
favorable
to
itself
or
the
actual
sales
price
less
the
bagging
cost
because
in
this
case,
as
the
court
has
noted,
the
bagging
cost
exceeded
the
bag
premium,
the
additional
revenue
generated
by
selling
the
cement
in
bags
rather
than
in
bulk.
and
so
the
taxpayer
took
sales
figure
of
cement
sold
in
bags,
reduced
that
by
the
cost
of
bagging,
which
was
greater
really
than
the
additional
income
generated
by
it.
and
put
that
in
the
sales
figure
that
then
was
allocated
in
accordance
with
the
proportionate
profits
formula.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
taxpayer
was
following
the
law
as
had
been
set
forth
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
1968
in
the
ideal
basic
case
when
it
interpreted
the
manner
in
which
the
proportionate
profits
formula
functioned
in
the
case
of
a
cement
manufacturer.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is,
within
the
regulation,
room
to
find
a
result
which
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
regulation.
the
language
mr.
smith
read
to
us
which
said
that
the
bulk
and
packaged
products
are
considered
to
be
essentially
the
same
product.
it
doesn't
say
they
are.
it
says
they
are
considered
to
be.
that
is
language
of
--
of
presumption,
not
language
of
absoluteness.
and
when
a
result
occurs
under
regulatory
language
that
clearly
is
at
conflict
with
a
purpose
of
the
language,
then
seems
to
me
that
this
language
is
susceptible
of
being
interpreted
in
a
manner
as
to
cure
the
--
the
distortion
which
will
result
under
mr.
smith's
interpretation.
and
indeed,
i
think
that
distortion
should
be
focused
on
because
it
is
material
to
--
to
realize
the
manner
in
which
the
purpose
of
the
--
applying
the
formula
is
being
frustrated.
now,
let's
return
momentarily,
the
purpose
is
to
determine
the
gross
income
from
mining.
that
is
the
value
of
the
taxpayer's
mineral
that
could
have
been
realized
had
it
been
sold
after
mining
process's
end.
so,
we're
looking
to
a
market
value
for
the
raw
mineral
product.
that's
the
purpose
for
which
the
formula
is
being
applied.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
mining
process
ends
at
the
point
of
kiln
feed.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
well,
that
is
introduced
into
the
--
the
kiln,
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer
with
respect
to
that.
but
the
taxpayer's
cement
rock
under
the
government's
interpretation
would
have
one
value
if
that
cement
rock
was
manufactured
into
finished
cement
and
sold
as
bulk
cement.
but
a
different
value,
the
same
identical
mineral,
would
have
a
different
value
if
it
was
manufactured
into
finished
cement
and
sold
in
bags
or
looked
at
differently.
if
in
a
given
year,
the
taxpayer
sold
5%
of
its
cement
rock
in
the
form
of
finished
cement
in
bags,
the
cement
rock
on
an
overall
basis
would
have
one
value.
the
next
year
it
sells
20%
in
bags
and
the
same
cement
rock
from
the
same
quarry,
assume
the
same
economic
conditions,
drops
in
value.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
went
down
to
zero
instead
of
7%
it
had
here,
the
cement
rock
changes
value.
now,
this
--
this
is
the
identical
mineral,
which
under
the
--
the
government's
theory
is
having
a
change
in
value
because
of
this
bagging
activity,
an
activity
which
occurs
after
all
mining
and
all
manufacturing
processes
have
been
completed.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
if
the
--
all
of
the
cement
were
sold
in
bags,
bagged
cement
would
be
the
first
marketable
product
because
what
is
being
looked
to
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
then
bagging
would
be
part
of
the
cost
in
arriving
at
that
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
--
because
what
is
being
looked
to
is
what
is
the
point
in
the
activity
of
getting
to
market
when
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
under
--
under
the
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
under
the
proportionate
profits
formula,
yes.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
and
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
there
would
be
--
because
of
the
--
the
manner
in
which
the
formula,
mathematical
formula
operates,
there
would
be
a
different
result.
well,
the
question
is
in
this
case,
there
are
actual
facts.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
there
are
actual
facts
which
can
be
looked
to
avoid
what
is
an
unrealistic
result
from
the
application
of
mechanical
formula.
and
that
really
is
the
question.
can
actual
facts
be
taken
into
account?
the
bagging
cost
and
the
amount
of
additional
income
because
it
is
clear
on
the
record
that
the
taxpayer
realized
a
certain
increment
of
revenue
when
it
sold
cement
in
bags
rather
than
in
bulk,
an
additional
amount
of
revenue.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
one
--
since
the
--
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
different
in
two
reasons
because
in
--
in
the
first,
there
may
be
sales
much
closer
to
the
--
the
manufacturing
plant
itself
and
so
as
they're
moved
away
from
that
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
other
--
the
other
thing
is
that
sales
costs.
sales
costs
are
costs
which
a
number
of
the
courts
said
they've
looked
at
it,
the
lower
courts,
have
decided
are
costs
allocable
both
to
the
mining
and
the
manufacturing
activity.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
and
so
they
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
--
they
allocate
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
they
allocate
them
--
well,
the
--
the
government
though,
under
its
interpretation
of
the
formula
would
allocate
the
cost
of
bagging
solely,
solely
to
the
manufacturing
non-mining
side.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
well,
the
--
the
manner
in
which
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
the
salary
of
a
general
sales
manager
should
be
treated
as
both
in
the
numerator
of
the
formula
and
in
the
denominator.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
again,
following
the
tenth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
interpretation
or
--
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
no,
because
that
is
not
the
manner
in
which
the
tenth
circuit
interprets
it.
mr.
dennis
p.
bedell
exactly,
exactly.
it
is
contemplated
by
the
--
the
statute
not
only
by
the
language
that
it'd
be
reasonable
but
that
it
take
into
account
the
variations
in
different
cases.
obviously,
administrative
convenience
and
simplicity
require
ignoring
some
variations,
but
when
you
have
variations
that
are
supported
by
definite
facts
such
as
in
this
case,
peculiar
circumstances
is
what
we
have
here,
and
ascertainable
income
item
and
ascertainable
costs
associated
with
the
bagging
activity,
then
that
is
the
type
of
case
which
it
should
be
dealt
with,
and
indeed
that
is
what
the
tenth
circuit
has
consistently
held
that
the
ideal
basic
case
in
1968,
the
portland
cement
company
of
utah
case
in
1969,
and
then
in
this
case.
because
the
--
of
this
actual
fact,
it
is
a
factor
which
can
be
taken
into
account
and
supports
the
determination
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
held
that
the
first
marketable
product
was
cement
in
bulk.
the
--
the
confusion
between
the
premise,
the
premise
of
the
proportionate
profits
formula
and
the
purpose
which
it
serves
of
trying
to
find
gross
income
from
mining
has
clouded
the
issue
in
--
in
many
--
that
the
context
has
been
looked
at
up
to
now.
there
is
distortion
which
occurs
if
additional
processes
farther
away
from
the
crude
mineral
product
which
is
being
valued
are
taken
into
account.
the
tenth
circuit
realized
that
and
the
tenth
circuit
because
it
realized
that
the
purpose
of
the
proportionate
profits
formula
is
to
value
the
mineral
product
found
a
place
closest
to
the
mine,
closest
to
the
point
where
the
mineral
product
is,
and
that
is
cement
in
bulk
and
treated
that
as
the
first
marketable
product
so
that
it
was
the
starting
point
for
the
application
of
this
mathematical
formula.
to
ascertain
the
market
value,
it
did
away
with
the
recognized
distorting
effects
which
occur
if
additional
activities
on
which
a
profit
is
not
earned
are
--
are
included
in
the
computation
in
the
same
manner
--
in
the
same
manner
as
the
regulations
explicitly
recognized
with
respect
to
purchased
transportation.
purchased
transportation
by
common
carrier
to
the
customer
to
deliver
the
material
to
the
customer
is
specifically
excluded.
why?
because
there
is
a
reason.
it
is
not
reasonable
to
presume
that
the
miner
earns
a
profit
on
the
transportation
because
the
carrier
earns
it.
the
evidence
of
a
tariff
demonstrates
that.
here,
the
facts,
the
evidence
of
the
bagging
premium
and
the
bagging
costs
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
attribute
any
further
profit
to
the
bagging
activity,
and
so
the
tenth
circuit
excluded
that
from
the
computation
in
a
similar
manner
by
its
determination
that
the
first
marketable
product
is
cement
in
bulk.
the
--
the
result
of
making
the
proportionate
profits
method
work
in
the
best
manner
it
can
to
serve
its
purpose
can
be
accomplished
as
the
tenth
circuit
did
or
by
finding
implicit
in
the
regulatory
language,
flexibility,
to
make
its
application
a
reasonable
one,
one
consistent
with
the
actual
facts.
i
thank
the
court.
