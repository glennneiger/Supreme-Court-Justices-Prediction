justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
right
there,
that
gross
sales
figure?
that
is
the
actual
--
that
isn't
the
constructed
figure,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
an
actual
figure
representing
the
sales
price
of
the
finished
product
whatever
that
product
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
first
marketable
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
if
it
normally,
that
--
that
price
would
be
enough
to
cover
all
costs,
anyway
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
they'll
go
broke.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
--
it's
--
so
it's
the
gross
sales
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
could
include
the
first
question
and
still
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
change
the
--
the
denominator,
could
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
--
exactly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
companies
that
sell
on
delivered
price
basis
and
they
pay
for
transportation?
you
don't
include
transportation.
you
--
you
deduct
transportation
costs
from
gross
sales
price,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ones
you
don't
make
a
profit
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
not
--
so
you
did
not
include
all
elements
of
gross
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
isn't
it
included?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
company
doesn't
make
a
profit
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
yes,
i'm
right
that
the
company
itself
doesn't
make
a
profit
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
they
didn't
make
any
profit
on
its
bagging?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
don't
want
to
worry
about
it
but
that's
the
very
worry
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
--
that
it
is
not
stipulated
that
he
made
a
profit
on
his
bagging
expense
on
the
bag.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
claim
is
that
he
loses,
that
it
cost
him
more
to
bag
than
he
--
than
he
adds
to
the
price
from
the
bagging.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
except
the
transportation
because
he
doesn't
make
a
profit
on
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
point
is
that
he
doesn't
make
a
profit
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
is
defining
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
taxpayer
price
list
said,
i'll
--
i'll
sell
cement
to
you
either
in
bags
or
in
gross
for
exactly
the
same
price
per
hundred?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
if
he
had
had
a
price
list
that
says
i'll
sell
you
bulk
cement
for
$2
and
bagged
cement
for
$2.10?
so,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
his
price
list
is
or
what
the
cost
of
bagging.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
your
case
if
it
were
stipulated
that
the
cost
of
bagging
was
20
cents,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
suggestion
is
that's
--
that's
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
isn't,
you
lose,
but
if
it
is,
you
should
win.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
source
of
the
language,
first
marketable
product?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
regulations
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
first
marketable
product
is
a
product
of
the
commissioner's
mine?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
isn't
that
a
little
--
isn't
it
a
little
strange
to
say
that
--
that
there
are
three
products
that
are
the
first
marketable
product
even
though
bulk
cement
--
you
have
to
do
something
else
to
it
to
get
it
in
the
bags?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
have
to
do
something
else
to
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
get
it
in
the
cement
block.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
costs
you
money
to
do
it
and
yet
you
say
all
three
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
what
about
the
bagged
cement?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
costs
him
money
if
there's
a
whole
new
--
another
process
to
go
through
to
put
in
bags.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
how
can
there
be
two
first
marketable
products?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that's
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
--
there's
--
although
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tenth
circuit
--
justice
white
you
say
bagged
--
you
say
bagged
cement
is
not
the
--
one
of
the
first
marketable
products
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
line
of
demarcation,
50%,
40%?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
do
you
want
it
to
--
to
be
included
in
your
gross
sales
figure,
the
multiplier
there?
you
--
you
just
want
the
--
yours
--
the
--
your
gross
sales
of
bulk
cement
in
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
that
--
you
--
you
say
along
with
mr.
smith
then
that
you
include
in
the
sales
figure
the
--
the
cement
sold
in
bags?
