mr.
stuart
a.
smith
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
income
tax
case
here
--
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
questions
involve
an
application
of
a
well-established
formula
method
set
out
in
the
regulations
for
more
than
40
years
for
measuring
the
gross
income
from
mining
of
a
taxpayer
who
mines
and,
thereafter,
produces
a
finished
manufactured
product,
the
so-called
integrated
miner-manufacturer.
the
object
of
the
formula
which
we
also
call
the
proportionate
profits
method
is
to
determine
the
price
at
which
the
taxpayer
would
have
sold
his
mine
or
to
itself
in
a
hypothetical
sale,
so
as
to
confine
the
depletion
deduction
to
its
intended
purpose
of
compensating
for
the
exhaustion
of
the
mineral
deposit.
the
depletion
deduction
is
a
fixed
percentage
of
gross
income
from
mining.
the
method,
the
proportionate
profits
method,
is
employed
as
it
was
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
representative
field
price
or
sales
of
actual
sales
at
the
cut-off
point
at
--
at
the
point
in
which
the
mining
activity
ceases
or
whether
it's
essentially
at
arm's
length.
and
the
underlying
theory
of
the
proportionate
profits
method,
which
is
a
cost
ratio
method
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
--
at
page
3,
it's
a
formula
which
essentially
multiplies
a
fraction,
the
numerator
of
which
is
mining
costs
over
total
costs,
that
is,
mining
plus
non-mining
costs
times
the
gross
sales
of
the
first
marketable
product
which
here
is
finished
portland
cement
and
that
figure
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
the
first
marketable
product.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
and
the
theory
of
the
--
the
underlying
theory
of
the
method
is
that
each
dollar
of
costs
earns
its
proportionate
share
of
gross
sales
and
thereby
of
profits.
and
the
questions
in
this
case
are
two
and
they
involve
a
--
they
may
involve
--
both
involve
detailed
applications
of
the
method.
the
first
question
involves
--
is
--
is
whether
the
gross
sales
figure,
that
is,
the
multiplier
of
the
first
marketable
product
includes
bulk
and
bagged
cement
as
the
regulations
require
or
whether
as
respondent
contends
simply
bulk
cement.
and
the
second
question
involves
the
denominator
of
the
fraction,
that
is,
the
total
cost
and
whether
the
--
whether
those
--
whether
that
denominator
should
include
costs
of
bags,
bagging,
storage,
distribution
and
sales
should
be
included
as
the
regulations
require.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
questions
are
interrelated.
i
think
the
--
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
facts
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
my
--
my
understanding
is
that
he
sought
to
exclude
them
entirely.
that
--
that's
basically
the
position
--
that's
basically
the
position
of
the
court
below
which
is
we
set
forth
in
our
petition
in
our
brief
is
really
--
has
been
out
of
line
with
not
only
the
regulations
but
with
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
so.
my
understanding
in
looking
at
the
briefs
now
is
the
taxpayer
is
--
is
seeking
a
prorated
--
prorated
approach.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it's
hard
to
tell.
i
mean,
i
can't
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
yes,
so,
it
more
or
less
then
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
i
--
they
said
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
i
really
win
on
the
first
question
as
a
logical
matter,
the
second
question
is
a
subsidiary
question
which
takes
care
of
itself
but
it's
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
it's
hard
--
it's
hard
to
know
exactly
how
the
court
below
felt
about
this
question
generally
because
it
had
--
this
question
has
been
kicking
around
in
the
tenth
circuit
ever
since
the
--
it's
the
idea
of
basic
test.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
the
--
what
the
tenth
circuit
has
said
and
which
we
take
strong
disagreement
with
is
that
the
first
marketable
product
was
bulk
cement.
let
me
just
simply
sketch
out
the
facts
which
are
relatively
simple.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
sell
mostly
bulk
cement.
the
bagged
cement,
accounts
for
about
7%
or
8%
of
its
--
7
or
8,
so
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
cement
in
bags,
it's
the
same
product.
it's
whether
it's
sold
in
a
railroad
car,
whether
it's
packed
in
bags
pursuant
to
particular
kind
of
customer
demand,
the
cement
in
bags.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple.
this
respondent,
like
all
others,
in
the
cement
industry
is
an
integrated
mine
--
miner-manufacturer
of
portland
cement.
the
mining
process
involves
a
quarrying
and
a
digging
of
this
cement
rock.
it's
a
calcium
carbonate
kind
of
rock.
it's
reduced
in
size.
it's
then
ground
to
a
high
degree
of
fineness.
water
is
added
to
produce
something
called
the
“slurry”
and
then
that
slurry
is
stored
in
tanks
and
agitated
to
maintain
uniform
mixture
until
--
until
such
time
as
it
passes
through
the
manufacturing
process.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
agreed
because
the
mining
process,
and
congress
has
you
know
ratified
this
in
section
613
(c)
(4)
(f)
which
was
enacted
in
response
to
the
court's
cannelton
decision,
the
mining
process
stops
at
the
kiln
feed.
everything
after
that
is
non-mining
and
then
this
liquid
slurry,
as
i
have
adverted,
is
then
fed
into
these
rotary
kilns
and
that
--
which
are
fired
and
a
hard
substance
called
a
“clinker”
is
ultimately
formed.
that
clinker
is
cooled,
ground
up
with
purchased
gypsum
to
produce
the
finished
cement
and
then
there's
a
final
grinding
and
then
the
finished
cement
is
stored
in
silos.
some
of
the
cement
is
sold
in
bulk,
in
tank
cars
or
piggyback
or
gondola
cars,
a
variety
of
different
forms
for
large
consumers
that
need
--
that
need
cement
in
that
kind
of
quantity.but
the
important
thing
is
that
cement
has
to
be
kept
dry,
otherwise,
it
becomes
wet,
it
becomes
worthless.
so
some
people
don't
need
that
much
cement
and
if
--
and
for
those
customers,
this
manufacturer,
as
well
as
all
to
others
in
the
integrated
industry,
pack
the
bag
--
pack
the
cement
in
bags
of
these
--
which
are
a
standard
94-pound
weight,
as
i
understand.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
then
i
--
i
--
we'd
have
a
different
case
but
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
quarrel.
i
mean,
essentially,
it
would
be
the
same
marketable
product,
in
our
view,
would
still
be
cement,
the
bagging
cost
would
be
a
cost
of
sale
and
we
would
contend
that
that
would
be
--
that
that
would
have
to
go
into
the
denominator
and
the
bagging
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
premium
would
go
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
but
i
assume
that
this
taxpayer
couldn't
really
argue
that
anything
else
was
a
first
marketable
product.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
concrete,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
should
know
this,
because
i'm
a
city
boy,
i
think
is
--
it
--
is
what
happens
when
the
cement
is
put
in
the
building
and
hardens.
i
think
you
talk
about
a
concrete
sidewalk.
i
don't
think
you
talk
about
a
cement
sidewalk,
but
i
could
be
wrong
on
that.
well,
the
--
this
taxpayer,
the
respondent
computed
its
gross
income
from
mining
in
accordance
with
the
proportionate
profits
method.
indeed,
it
had
to
because,
as
i
said,
there
is
no
representative
field
price
and
it
did
not
sell,
and
as
nor
did
anyone
in
this
industry
sell
kiln
feed,
so
there's
no
way
to
know
how
much
kiln
feed
would
sell
for.
but
contrary
to
the
command
of
the
regulations
and
i
have
to
emphasize
that
these
regulations
which
are
set
forth
in
detail
and
are
at
the
appendix
to
our
brief
are
detailed
and
more
or
less
preempt
this
area
and
preempt
it
in
accordance
with
a
command
of
congress
in
section
611(a)
that
the
commission
to
promulgate
such
regulations,
the
respondent
computed
its
gross
income
by
excluding
bagged
cement
from
the
computation
and
by
excluding
the
cost
of
bagging,
storage,
distribution
and
sales
from
the
total
costs
element
in
the
form
and
of
the
so-called
“the
--
the
denominator
in
that
fraction.”
the
tax
court
in
this
case
upheld
the
respondent
because
the
tax
court
has
a
rule
in
which
it
will
follow
the
relevant
circuit
to
which
a
case
will
go,
the
so-called
“golsen
rule”
and
since
the
court
of
--
this
court
of
appeals
had
already
expressed
itself
in
the
idea
of
basic
case,
that's
why
the
tax
court
held
the
way
it
did
and
the
court
of
appeals
followed
its
idea
of
basic
decision.
now,
in
our
view
with
respect
to
the
first
question,
the
respondent's
first
marketable
product
is
finished
cement,
regardless
of
the
form
of
packaging.
as
i
said,
the
theory
of
the
proportionate
profits
method
is
that
each
dollar
of
costs
produces
the
same
percentage
of
profits
to
exclude
any
costs
or
any
element
of
any
aspect
of
gross
sales
received
in
production
or
a
sale
of
the
first
marketable
product
ompromises
the
integrity
of
the
formula.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
only
certain
kinds
of
transportation,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
essentially,
if
--
if
they're
delivered
over,
they
would
transport
it
and
it's
the
transport
as
profit.
that
is
--
that
is
an
accommodation
that
the
regulations
make
with
respect
to
purchase
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
that
--
that
as
i
understand
is
the
only
element
of
gross
sales
that
is
not
included.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it's
not
included
as
i
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
the
company
--
basically,
because
it's
to
transport
is
profit
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
company
does
not
make
a
profit
on
the
transportation
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
--
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
worry
about
that
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it's
not
the
very
worry
in
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no,
it
isn't,
mr.
justice
white.
and
the
reason
it
isn't
is
because
the
--
the
respondent
--
because
it's
been
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
respondent
realized
the
net
profit
on
the
sale
of
each
bag
of
cement
and
it
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
if
you
--
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
it
is
not
stipulated
that
he
made
a
profits
on
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
the
--
but
the
point
of
the
proportionate
profits
method
is
that
it
has
to
measure
the
sales
of
the
--
of
a
finished
product
and
part
of
the
--
and
the
--
with
this
respondent
as
well
as
all
other
cement-integrated
producers
sold
bagged
cement
in
response
to
a
customer
demand,
put
cement
in
bags
and
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
relevant
fact
is
that
this
respondent
earned
a
profit
on
each
bag
of
cement
that
it
sold.
and
once
it
is
assumed
that
that
is
a
profitable
aspect
of
its
business,
all
of
that
has
to
go
into
the
equation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
except
transportation
because
transportation
basically
is
taken
out
of
his
hands
and
put
into
the
hands
of
the
transporter.
and
the
point
--
our
point
is
with
respect
to
transportation
that
i
know
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly,
but
--
but
he
--
but
he
did
make
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
bagged
cement
and
i
think
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
conditions
of
the
regulation,
the
purchase
--
transportation
regulations
are
set
forth
at
page
13(a)
of
our
--
of
our
appendix
to
our
brief
and
you
can
see
that
the
conditions
are
very
narrow.
it
says
which
are
--
it's
not
transportation
conducted
by
the
taxpayer
but
which
is
performed
in
conveyances
owned
or
leased
by
persons
other
than
the
taxpayer
rather
than
in
conveyances
owned
or
leased
by
the
taxpayer
which
are
performed
solely
to
deliver
the
taxpayer's
minerals
and
mineral
products
to
the
customer
rather
than
to
transport
such
minerals
or
products
for
packaging
or
other
additional
processing
which
you
charge
the
customers
in
such
a
way
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
ordinarily
earn
any
profit
with
respect
to
such
transportation.
now,
that
is
the
--
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
arguable
exception
to
the
integrity
of
the
method
because
the
method
demands
that
all
--
the
method
won't
work
with
respect
to
carving
out
that
aspect
of
gross
income
from
mining
unless
the
denominator
in
that
fraction
includes
all
of
the
costs
and
the
multiplier
includes
the
gross
income
from
mining
and
since
this
taxpayer
sold
cement
in
bags
and
charged
a
price
for
it,
that
whole
price
has
to
be
included
because
if
--
because
if
it
isn't,
you
--
you
don't
get
--
its
an
approximated
method
but
the
approximation
you
know
starts
to
depart
from
the
intended
ambit
of
the
depletion
allowance
which
is
to
compensate
for
the
exhaustion
of
the
mineral
deposit
and
not
to
--
and
not
to
provide
any
deduction
for
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
non-mining
--
non-
mining
activity.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
for
exactly
the
same
price
per
hundred?
then
i
assume
--
then
i
assume
that
you
know
people
will
either
take
it
one
way
or
another.
that
--
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
taxpayer
is
not
making
a
profit.
all
it
means
is
that
he's
selling
bagged
cement
for
--
for
less.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it
doesn't
make
any
--
well,
it
does
make
it,
in
your
example,
it
makes
a
difference,
but
the
point
is
that
his
gross
sale
of
a
--
of
his
first
marketable
product
in
--
in
that
--
in
the
--
in
your
latter
example
is
either
$2
or
$2.10.
and
we
assume
as
the
--
as
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
me
that
the
cost
of
bagging,
and
in
fact
it
was
--
you
know,
essentially,
that
there
was
a
disparity
between
the
bagging
premium
and
the
bagging
cost
in
this
case.
but
--
but
essentially
all
that
means
is
that
he's
selling
the
cement
for
less.
i
mean
we
have
to
assume
that
this
taxpayer
sold
bagged
cement,
and
you
know
the
third
circuit
more
or
less
inferred
that
in
whitehall
and
though
--
and
there's
an
array
of
on
the
part
of
authority
that
rejects
the
notion
that
you
can
simply
say,
“well,
the
bagging
aspects
of
this
thing
are
just
an
entirely
different
business
and
that
we're
going
to
ignore
them
because
it's
--
because
the
regulations
provide
with
explicit
direction
that
the
first
marketable
product
is
cement
no
matter
--
what
--
no
matter
how
it's
packaged
in
either
bulk
or
bagged
form.”
if
i
can
--
can
refer
the
court
to
page
8(a)
of
our
appendix
which
says
here,
“the
first
marketable
product
meets
the
product,
produced
by
the
taxpayer
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
non-mining
processes
in
a
form
or
condition
in
which
such
product
or
products
are
first
marketed
in
significant
quantities
by
the
taxpayers.”
and
then
with
specific
reference
to
the
cement
industry,
they
say
here,
“for
example,
if
the
a
cement
manufacturer
sells
his
own
finished
cement
of
various
types
in
bulk
and
bags
and
also
sells
concrete
blocks
or
dry
ready-mixed
aggregates
containing
additives,
the
finished
cement
of
various
types
in
bulk
and
bags
constitutes
the
first
marketable
product.”
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
we
should
win
because
--
because
the
statute
simply
permits
the
commissioner
to
--
permits
a
reasonable
allowance
and
also,
this
case
has
been
made
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
or
his
delegate.
now
the
--
that's
a
very
broad
delegation.
we
view
those
regulations
as
legislative
in
type
and
this
court
has
held
in
cases
which
are
legion
that
the
commissioner's
regulations
are
entitled
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
is
the
--
i
assume
that
the
source
of
the
first
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
not
in
the
statute
but
i
assume
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
based
--
based
upon
his
reading
of
the
--
of
this
court's
decision
in
cannelton
sewer
pipe
which
talked
about
commercially
marketable
pipe.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
put
it
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
in
the
bag.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
--
oh
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no.
that's
not
what
i
said.
that
the
--
the
block
is
--
is
not
the
first
marketable
product.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no,
i
didn't.
he
also
--
it
says
the
finished
cement
of
various
types
in
bulk
and
bags
constitutes
the
first
marketable
product
but
the
blocks
and
the
aggregates
and
the
(inaudible)
or
whatever,
that's
a
different
product.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
bags
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
course
there
--
no,
there's
only
one
first
marketable
product,
cement,
no
matter
how
it's
packaged.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
in
our
view,
bagging
is
not
--
is
not
a
chemical
or
a
physical
process
that
adds
--
that
--
that
alters
the
character
of
the
--
of
the
manufactured
product.
the
manufactured
product
is
portland
cement
whether
it's
in
a
railroad
car,
the
fifth
circuit
stated
this
with
excruciating
detail,
whether
its
in
a
railroad
car
or
a
piggyback
or
whatever,
it's
still
cement
and
if
you
put
it
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
--
oh
well,
that's
really
a
mischaracterization
of
the
government's
position.
the
government
argues
that
the
first
marketable
product
is
finished
cement
no
matter
how
it's
packaged.
i'm
reading
this
most
charitably,
i
would
assume
that
what
the
court
meant
is
that
the
government
seeks
to
have
bagged
cement
included
in
the
first
marketable
product
because
it's
the
--
it's
the
same
cement.
it's
simply
put
in
a
bag.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right.
i
mean,
the
--
the
tenth
circuit
took
the
position
that
bulk
cement
was
the
first
product
and
bagged
cement
was
the
second
product,
but
--
the
putting
something
in
a
bag
is
not
the
chemical
or
physical
processing
that
the
court
in
cannelton
adverted
to
when
it
tried
to
fix
the
cut-off
point
as
to
when
mining
stops
and
when
manufacturing
begins.
and
you
know,
put
--
the
bagging
is
clearly
part
of
the
manufacturing
cost
but
it
goes
into
the
sales
of
what
this
respondent
and
all
other
integrated
producers
sell
as
the
first
marketable
product.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
have
to
--
it
would
have
to
be
included
in
the
gross
sales
of
the
first
marketable
product
and
--
then
it
would
be
--
you
know
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
it
may
--
it
may
affect
the
--
the
amount
of
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly.
and
went
on
--
and
--
and
the
suggestion
on
the
--
the
argument
that
i'm
making
is
simply
not
one
that's
based
up
upon
regulations
that
we
contend
deserve
great
deference
as
legislative
regulations.
the
court
has
held
in
a
variety
of
depletion
cases
that
the
commissioner
has
special
powers
in
the
depletion
area
because
the
legislative
authority
delegated
the
--
the
authority
delegated
to
him
is
so
broad,
but
in
the
--
but
--
but
the
respondent
is
faced
with
an
array
of
appellate
decisions
in
which
the
court
below
is
--
stands
as
the
sole
exception
that
the
first
marketable
product
in
this
area
is
bulk
and
bagged
cement.
that
is,
finished
cement.
i
would
like
--
since
the
second
question
is
a
subsidiary
one
and
i
assume
that
costs
necessarily,
include
in
the
denominator,
flow
from
the
first
--
from
the
first
opinion
i
--
from
the
first
question,
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
it's
the
same
bread.
and
if
there
are
tax
deductions
that
--
or
computation
that
flow
from
--
from
that
that
involve
gross
sales,
if
the
--
if
the
supermarket
in
the
united
states
has
to
sell
some,
has
to
raise
the
price
to
take
into
account
the
bag
or
if
it
doesn't,
that
--
those
sales
have
to
be
included
in
gross
sales.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
respondent's
emphasis
on
--
on
actual
facts
is
--
is
belied
by
the
--
by
the
provisions
of
the
regulations
which
provide
that
if
--
that
the
commissioner
may
determine
that
a
method
of
computation
is
more
appropriate
than
the
proportionate
profits
method
or
the
method
being
used
by
the
taxpayer
and
that
the
taxpayer
can
request
such
a
determination
of
an
alternative
method.
here,
the
taxpayer
has,
because
of
its
integrated
status,
and
the
absence
of
a
--
of
a
representative
field
price
has
invoked
the
proportionate
profits
method
of
computing
its
gross
income
from
mining.
it
hasn't
sought
to
bring
any
actual
facts
to
the
commissioner
before
--
before
going
into
this
litigation.
the
proportionate
profits
method
provides
in
detail
the
--
the
language
i
read
to
the
court
about
a
cement
manufacturer.
when
we
talk
about
flexibility
of
the
regulations,
the
regulations
provide
at
page
21(a)
of
our
appendix
with
precise
reference
to
this
case,
“if
a
cement
manufacturer,”
et
cetera,
et
cetera
there
is
no
room
for
any
flexible
reading.
what
the
respondent
seeks
in
this
case
is
nothing
less
than
an
invalidation
of
these
regulations
which
three
courts
of
appeals
have
approved
and
which
the
court
below
stands
in
sole
and
persistent
invalidation
of.
and
there's
no
way
that
one
can
read
these
regulations
in
a
flexible
way
to
take
account
of
what
this
--
of
what
respondent
seeks
in
this
case,
which
in
our
view,
is
nothing
less
than
an
expanded
depletion
allowance
that
would
include
part
of
its
non-mining
income.
the
cost
ratio
method
is
indeed
an
--
an
approximation,
but
it
is
an
approximation
which
is
designed
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
each
dollar
of
costs
produces
a
proportionate
amount
of
--
of
gross
sales
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
of
course,
it's
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
of
course,
it's
a
fiction
but
it's
an
approximation
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
which
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there's
no
really
better
way
to
do
it,
and
regulations
like
that,
the
choice
that
the
commissioner
makes
in
--
in
areas
like
a
technical
area
like
depletion,
and
in
other
areas
of
the
code
have
been
consistently
upheld
by
this
court
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
and
by
the
courts
as
basically
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
elected
the
proportionate
profits
method
and
you
can't
simply
elect
parts
of
the
proportionate
profits
method.
putting
a
cement
--
putting
cement
in
a
bag
is,
in
our
view,
and
in
the
view
of
the
regulations,
not
processing.
it
doesn't
alter
the
character
of
the
cement.
the
cement,
whether
it's
in
a
tank
car
or
whether
it's
in
a
bag,
is
still
portland
cement.
that
was
the
respondent's
first
marketable
product
and
it's
the
gross
sales
of
those
things.
if
the
--
if
the
taxpayer
had
sold
portland
cement
at
a
great
killing,
at
a
very
high
price,
whether
--
it
would
still
be
in
gross
sales
and
it
was
a
--
you
know,
it
may
produce
some
variations
or
some
distortions,
or
if
the
market
goes
down,
it
would
still
be
in
gross
sales.
and
the
fact
that,
you
know,
it
sought
to
satisfy
a
particular
kind
of
demand
of
a
small
--
of
small
customers
in
this
--
in
the
construction
industry
for
94-pound
bags
of
cement,
that
was
part
of
its
business.
and
if
it's
part
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
of
its
business
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
sales
expense
after
bagging
to
get
it
to
the
customer
is
a
--
is
--
goes
into
the
denominator.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
and
for
--
and
for
all
those
purposes
we
think
the
reason
--
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
