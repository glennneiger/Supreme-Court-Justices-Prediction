on
the
portion
of
the
gross
sales
that
represent
product
that
was
bagged,
what
is
the
constructive
--
the
sales
price
that
the
taxpayer
contended
for?
is
it
the
equivalent
of
the
unbagged
cement
or
is
it
the
actual
price
less
the
bagging
cost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that's
consistent
with
your
basic
position
that
the
sales
cost
is
the
cost
of
the
unbagged
cement.
i
mean
the
sales
price
is
the
price
of
the
unbagged
cement?
it
may
have
been
good
tactics
to
do
it
that
way
because
i
see
what
you're
saying
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
somewhat
inconsistent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree,
by
the
way,
that
the
government's
position
is
the
one
that
the
regulation
commands
and
so
you
must
--
you
must
attack
the
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
say
if
for
the
same
reason
that
sales
expense
after
bagging
is
included?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
same
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
same
reason?
