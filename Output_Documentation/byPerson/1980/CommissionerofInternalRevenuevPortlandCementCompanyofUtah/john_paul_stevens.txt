well,
so

but
your

but
if
--
if
your
first
marketable
product
is
bulk
cement

justice
john
paul

you're
certainly
not
going
to
include
in
the
denominator
the
cost
of
bagging.

mr.
smith

justice

is
it
agreed
that
the

the
mining
phase
stops
at
the
point
where

justice
john

mr.
smith,
i
suppose
it
never
happens,
but
suppose
this
manufacturer
sold
everything
in

in
bags,
would
you
have
a
different
case?

justice

mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
prompted
by
some
of
mr.
justice
white's
question?
as
i
understand
your
position
as
a
matter
of
fact
(inaudible)
with
the
taxpayer
as
they
made
a
profit
on
the
bagged
cement
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
they
wouldn't
sell
it
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
profit
on
the
bagged
cement
is
less
than
the
profit
on
the
other
cement
because
the
bags
are
more
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
costly
than
the
bagging
premium.
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
your
analysis
of
the
case,
even
if
they
lost
money
on
the
bagging
--
the
bagged
cement,
say,
the
bags
were
so
terribly
expensive,
they
packed
them
up
in
christmas
packages
or
something.
they
lost
money
on
the
bags
but
you'd
still
make
the
same
position

john
paul
stevens
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
your
point
of
view,
just
as
if
they
maybe
had
a
price
cut
during
february
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
lost
money
for
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
three
or
four
weeks
the
--
you'd
still
use
the
same
basic
ingredients
(voice

--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
now,
what
if
the
situation
were
reversed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
there
were
more
in
bags
than
in
bulk,
only
1%
of
bulk,
would
your
position
here
be
exactly
the
same?
