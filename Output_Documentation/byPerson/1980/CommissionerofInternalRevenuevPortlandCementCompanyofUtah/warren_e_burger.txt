thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
commissioner
of

cement
company.
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready,
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
do
they
sell
most
of
by
the
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
would
take
the
same
position
that
he
does
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
once
--
one
answer
might
be
that
the
reason
you're
here
is
because
the
tenth
circuit,
from
your
point
of
view,
did
not
understand
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
one
more
question.
does
your
case
really
boil
down
and
perhaps
oversimplified,
something
like
the
difference
between
buying
a
loaf
of
bread
in
paris
where
you
put
it
under
your
arm,
and
buying
one
at
the
supermarket
here
where
it's
all
wrapped
up
in
a
package?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bedell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
--
let
me
put
it
--
let
me
put
--
i
--
i'm
alternately
confused
in
finding
the
case
simplified.
when
--
when
and
what
is
it
that
can
be
first
be
sold?
what
can
first
be
sold
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
--
is
the
case
any
more
complicated
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
sounds
as
though
you
agree
with
mr.
smith
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
i
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounds
as
though
you
do,
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
bulk
than
bag.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
did
the
process
end
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
carry
it
one
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
step
further,
what
if
the
industry
as
a
whole
sold
largely
or
totally
in
bulk
and
this
one
manufacturer
sold
it
just
in
bags?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
smith,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
against
portland
cement
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
