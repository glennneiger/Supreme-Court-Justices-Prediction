justice
william

rehnquist
well,
mr.
smith,
is
that
consistent
with
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
at
14(a)
of
the
petition
down
towards
the
bottom
where
the
court
there
says,
â€œthe
government
seeks
to
have
"bagged
cement"
be
the
"first
marketable
product"
and
to
so
include
the
expenses
associated
with
the
bag?
does
the
government
take
the
same
position?
justice

well,
mr.
bedell
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
--
if
one
reads
the
statutory
language
itself,
the
611(a),
the
general
rule
in
talking
about
mines,
it
says
that
the
allowance
for
depletion,
for
depreciation
improvements
according
to
the
peculiar
conditions
in
each
case,
such
reasonable
allowance
in
all
cases
to
be
made
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
or
his
delegate,
is
it
conceivable
in
--
in
view
of
that
reference
to
peculiar
cases
that
the
numerator
or
denominator
were
worked
out
by
the
--
could
itself
be
unreasonable
in
some
cases?
