justice
stevens
mr.
harbison,
i
understand
what
you're
saying
when
the
money
changes
hand.
but
part
of
the
attack
on
the
rule
is
an
overbreadth
attack,
that
it's
overbroad
because
it
covers
the
handout
of
written
material
even
though
these
people
want
to
get
money
for
it.
how
do
you
defend
the
prohibition
if
you
don't
rely
on
littering?
how
do
you
defend
the
prohibition
of
handing
out
material
for
no
money?
justice
stevens
well
let's
assume
for
the
moment...
i
mean,
one
argument
you
make
is
there
should
be
no
overbreadth
analysis.
but
assume
for
a
moment
we
were
going
to
say,
yes,
we'll
look
at
it
under
overbreadth.
do
you
defend
the
rule
to...
say,
the
plaintiffs
here
just
wanted
to
hand
out
leaflets
like
a
political
candidate.
do
you
defend
the
rule
as
applied
just
to
that
and,
if
so,
why,
if
it's
not
based
on
littering?
justice
stevens
i
want
to
know
what
your
justification
for
that
component
is.
justice
stevens
it's
a
card
that
says,
vote
for
me
for
county
assessor,
or
something,
but
it's
a--
justice
stevens
isn't
there
another
response
to
that
argument,
and
that
is
that
they
do
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
persuade
orally
the
people
to
go
over
to
the
booth?
justice
stevens
i
thought
it
was
clear...
maybe
i
missed
it,
but
i
thought
it
was
clear
that
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
to
accost
somebody
in
the
common
grounds
of
the
fair
and
say,
we
would
like
to
sell
you
some
literature
which
you
must
purchase
over
at
our
booth.
you
don't
think
that's
clear?
justice
stevens
well,
the
purpose
is
you
confine
the
exchange
of
money
to
booths.
justice
stevens
well,
no,
they
prohibit
the
handing
out
literature--
justice
stevens
--but
no
physical
transfer
of
any
chattel
one
way
or
the
other
except
at
the
booth.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
that
your
adversary
doesn't
read
the
rule
that
way?
justice
stevens
all
they
did
was
enjoin
its
enforcement
against
these
litigants.
justice
stevens
well,
even
under
their
holding
i
don't
think
the
candidate
for
political
office
could
get
the
benefit
of
this
rule.
justice
stevens
well,
yes,
their
order
is
very
specific
on
a-68.
it
just
enjoins
the
application
of
the
rule
to
these
litigants.
justice
stevens
and
it
also
emphasized
the
special
character
of
these
litigants
in
its
opinion.
justice
stevens
what
i'm
saying
is,
they
clearly
have
not
decided
anything
other
than
the
fact
that
these
litigants
are
entitled
to
relief.
but
you
agree
with
the
dissenters
to
that
extent?
justice
stevens
no,
we
got
into
this
because
justice
white
asked
you
if
the
rule
was
invalid
on
its
face
or
if
the
lower
court
had
so
held,
and
i
say,
it
clearly
did
not
so
hold.
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
refinement
here
and
that
is
that
theoretically,
at
least,
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
the
correct
answer,
the
rule
might
be
overbroad
only
to
the
extent
that
it
prohibited
the
free
handing
out
of
literature.
and
if
the
ruling
on
that
ground
was
the
ultimate
decision,
that
wouldn't
do
your
clients
any
good.
justice
stevens
as
i
understand
it,
they
don't
want
to
do
that.
part
of
their
mission
is
to
get
money--
justice
stevens
--isn't
it
part
of
their
religious
mission
to
get
the
money
at
the
time--
justice
stevens
--they
engage
in
this
transaction
because
they
don't
give
these
things
away.
justice
stevens
mr.
harbison,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
rule?
i
thought
i
understood
it
before
but
i'm
not
sure
i
do
now.
in
the
stipulation,
the
rule
is
quoted
and
it
refers
to
"sale
or
distribution
of
any
merchandise,
including
printed
or
written
material,
except
under
license
issued
for
from
the
society
and/or
from
a
duly
licensed
location.
"
now,
as
i
read
that,
it
does
contemplate
some
licenses
for
distribution
that
are
roving
licenses,
in
effect.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
you
don't
even
have
any
roving
hot
dog
vendors
or
anything
like
that
or?
justice
stevens
good
humor
man
or
anything
like
that?
