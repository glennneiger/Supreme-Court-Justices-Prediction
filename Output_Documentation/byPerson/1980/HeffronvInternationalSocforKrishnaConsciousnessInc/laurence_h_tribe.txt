mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
in
this
case
seeks
to
expel
from
the
open
and
public
areas
of
the
state
fair
and
to
corral
in
these
fixed
booths,
which
indeed,
as
mr.
harbison
points
out,
are
sometimes
inside
building,
exercises
of
speech,
press,
and
religion,
which
clearly
lie
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
i
think
a
number
of
the
questions
that
have
been
directed
to
mr.
harbison
expose
in
a
way
that
perhaps
the
record
and
the
briefs
alone
would
not
have
done
quite
so
dramatically
the
sweep
and
breadth
of
this
rule.
mr.
justice
white
asked,
what
about
a
politician
walking
around
with
information
on
a
sign?
and
mr.
harbison
says,
perhaps
that
would
be
allowed.
but
it
appears,
in
the
stipulated
facts,
as
one
might
expect,
since
a
rule
against
exhibiting
or
distributing
literature
can
hardly
draw
much
of
a
line
between
what
you
wear
on
your
back
and
what
you
put
in
your
palm
and
what
you
hand
to
someone,
it
appears
that
that
might
not
be
allowed
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
we
needn't
urge
this
court
to
reach
that
issue,
but
it
does
make
clear
how
broad
the
rule
is.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
overbreadth
position
that
we
take
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
is
well
founded
in
the
schaumberg
case
itself.
that
is,
we
are
dealing
here
with
activity
that
is
hardly
at
the
periphery
of
the
first
amendment.
we're
dealing
here
with
core
first
amendment
activity,
distributing
literature,
and
the
fact
that
the
law
does
reach
that
far
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
court
should
strike
it
down.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
it's
not
arbitrary.
it's
simply
a
flat
exclusion,
and
i
think
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
dissent
below
rightly
pointed
out
that
we
were
not
claiming
any
special
treatment.
others
would
potentially
be
eligible
to
seek
exemption.
but
as
this
court
last
month
said
in
thomas
v.
indiana
review
board,
simply
conjuring
up
an
unmanageable
number
of
requests
for
exemptions
without
proof
in
the
record
that
it
would
indeed
be
unmanageable
through
some
neutral
feeling
on
numbers,
is
not
a
permissible
basis
for
suppressing
protected
activity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
afraid,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
can't
share
that
presumption.
the
business
of
wandering
around
in
the
heat
of
a
minnesota
state
fair
hoping
to
attract
attention
is
not
an
obviously
pleasant
alternative
to
a
nicely
rented,
probably
air
conditioned
booth.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
guess
that
the
decision
will
not
turn
on
the
temperature
of
minnesota
in
the
summer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
we
certainly
haven't
abandoned
the
argument
that
the
claim
is
stronger
here,
nor
did
we
argue
below,
which
is
suggested
by
some
notion
of
abandonment,
that
a
special
exemption
was
warranted.
as
justice
todd
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
on
page
72--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
correct.
we
think
that
that
makes
the
claim
even
more
dramatic,
but
we
believe
that
it
would
not
be
principled
to
limit
the
exemption
just
to
one
religious
group.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
language
of
the
rule,
we
agree,
pre
dates
their
arrival,
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
rule
on
its
face
says
nothing
about
solicitation.
it's
simply
been
interpreted
to
encompass
solicitation
now.
and
the
record
doesn't
itself
illuminate
the
question
of
why
the
rule
has
been
broadened
to
deal
with
solicitation.
in
light
of
the
problem
suggested,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
by
your
question,
about
the
degree
to
which
one
is
genuinely
free
in
the
state
fair
of
minnesota
under
this
rule,
looked
at
on
its
face,
to
wander
around
and
proselytize
orally.
we
are
assured
by
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
that
one
could
quite
freely
indicate
verbally,
as
long
as
one
didn't
have
a
sign
on
or
hand
out
anything,
that
one
represented
a
certain
religion
which
was
in
need
of
funds,
that
there
was
a
booth
back
there,
that
contributions
might
be
made
at
the
booth.
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
where
the
line
is
ever
going
to
be
drawn
between
that
and
solicitation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
am
certain
you
could,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
if
you
added
political
and
charitable
organizations,
there
might
be
more
still.
but
even
if
you
take
the
attorney
general's
representation
and
attempt
to
paint
the
chaos
at
its
worst,
that
perhaps
there
would
be
a
thousand
proselytizers
and
solicitors
and
distributors
in
an
area
where
there
are
over
115,000
visitors
a
day,
even
if
we
assume
at
worst
that
one
out
of
100
people
is
trying
to
persuade
someone
else
to
give
money
to
a
fledgling
religion
or
to
a
rising
candidacy,
it
seems
to
me
the
proposition
that
that
in
itself
is
the
sort
of
specter
the
state
can
shut
down
protected
speech
and
religious
exercise
to
avoid
will
be
consistent
with
the
judgments
of
this
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
so
it
isn't
all
that
bad.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
so
it
isn't
all
that
bad
if
all
this
should
materialize,
i
suppose.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
i'm
curious
why
that
hasn't
happened
in
state
fair
after
state
fair
where
the
lower
courts
have
ruled
at
the
behest
of
the
krishna
consciousness
group
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
ban
solicitation
and
distribution.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
is
true
that
the
new
york
district
court
ruling
now
pending
in
this
court
seeking
certiorari
before
judgment
has
gone
the
other
way,
but
in
the
majority
of
cases,
in
the
4th
circuit,
in
the
7th
circuit,
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
in
a
number
of
cases
over
the
past
four
or
five
years,
i
would
say
the
trend
has
been
to
say
that
because
this
is
obviously
a
public
forum,
a
literal
marketplace
of
ideas,
and
because
the
concerns
about
congestion
and
fraud
can
be
more
narrowly
met,
that
there
has
to
be
a
relaxation
of
the
rule
when
it
comes
to
a
religious
group.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
historically,
the
fairs
of
europe
and
leipzig
and
in
other
places
surely
were
primarily
religious
activities.
they
did
become
more
secular
but
the
history
of
the
minnesota
state
fair,
not
a
typical
in
this
country,
shows
that
it
has
been
a
literal
crossroads
of
cultural,
religious,
political,
as
well
as
commercial
activity.
it
was
the
favorite
stopping
point
of
presidential
candidates
in
the
early
20th
century.
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
it
is
a
less
appropriate
place
for
the
exchange
of
ideas
than
streets
and
parks
where
people
usually
go
to
get
some
place
or
to
enjoy
themselves.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
it
is
less
appropriate
in
any
sense
than
the
other
places
that
this
court
has
suggested
are
public
fora.
and
in
this
kind
of
public
forum
to
have
a
total
ban
on
even
distribution
of
literature
with
no
commercial
element,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
with
no
problem
of
littering,
when
there
are
other
methods
of
dealing
with
fraud
and
congestion,
seems
to
us
to
be
grossly
overbroad.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
putting
some
reasonable
ceiling
numerically,
as
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
said
they
would
be
willing
to
live
with,
is
perfectly
constitutional.
the
fact
that
something
is
a
public
forum...
a
courtroom...
a
public
forum
in
which
people
can
come
and
listen,
doesn't
mean
that
more
people
than
can
be
accommodated
for
its
purpose
must
be
permitted
to
be
there.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
be
so
incompatible
with
the
function
and
decorum
of
this
courtroom,
for
the
people
here
to
walk
around,
in
contrast
with
the
state
fair,
that
i'm
sure
the
answer's
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
the
quiet
and
tranquillity
and
the
educational
function
of
these
halls
is
incompatible
with
that
kind
of
wandering,
although
i
must
admit
i
haven't
carefully
enough
thought
about
it
to
want
to
be
held
to
that.
a
state
fair
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
surely.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
educational,
not
in
the
sense
that
a
library
is,
where
people
wander
and
carefully,
quietly,
calmly
select.
it's
educational
in
the
sense
that
the
cross
fire
of
ideas
and
options
and
opinions
makes
it
a
saturation
place
for
exposure.
it's
for
that
very
reason
that
respondents
find
it
such
an
attractive
and
important
place
to
expose
people
to
the
possibility
that
what
the
respondents
believe
in
really
merits
their
attention.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
because
people
come
to
this
court
for
a
much
more
specific
purpose
and
with
a
particular
event
or
set
of
events
in
mind,
it
would
not
be
nearly
so
difficult
to
justify
the
proposition
that
the
purposes
of
the
court,
like
the
purposes
of
a
library
or
of
the
white
house
or
of
some
other
special
building,
are
incompatible
with
quite
the
same
kind
of
robust,
wide
open
discussion
and
distribution
and
solicitation
that
clearly
is
compatible
with
the
function
of
a
fair.
but
again
this
court
needn't
decide
exactly
how
many
institutions
and
fora
are
brought
within
the
principle.
there's
no
claim
made
by
the
state
of
minnesota
in
this
case,
and
no
proposition
adduced
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
to
the
effect
that
the
purposes
of
the
fair
are
compromised
by
the
very
presence
of
these
people.
what
is
claimed,
rather,
is
that
if
they
engage
in
certain
kinds
of
excessive
or
abusive
behavior,
which
incidentally
has
not
been
found
here...
there
are
simply
some
unverified
complaints
and
four
signed
complaints...
if
they
engage
in
that
kind
of
behavior,
or
if
they
blocked
entranceways
or
get
in
the
way
of
certain
queues
and
lines,
that
they
then
may
pose
an
administrative
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that's...
certainly,
mr.
justice.
and
the
only
kind
of
deference
that
i
would
suggest
even
remotely
to
that
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
that
its
proximity
to
the
situation
and
its
sensitivity
to
the
purposes
that
the
state
of
minnesota
seeks
to
advance
are
at
least
as
likely
to
be
reflected
in
its
judgment
as
this
court
indicated
was
true
in
michael
m.
v.
superior
court
of
sonoma
county,
not
long
ago,
when
deference
was
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
where
that
court
had
upheld
rather
than
struck
down
a
law
of
the
state
that
seemed
appropriate.
we
simply
suggest
that
if
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
sees
no
difficulty
with
less
restrictive
modes
of
achieving
the
state's
goals
and
if
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
doesn't
indicate
that
this
state
fair
is
somehow
more
like
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
than
like
the
fairs
of
early
america
and
of
europe,
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
to
view
the
case
in
other
than
the
context
of
a
conventional
public
forum.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
not
have
one
additional
argument
that
i
think
is
one
that
strengthens
the
case.
i
think
the
result
ought
to
be
the
same.
but
i
think
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
viewed
the
record
as
it
did
is
helpful.
it
makes
it
less
problematic
than
it
otherwise
might
for
this
court
to
speculate
on
the
purposes
of
the
rule
and
the
way
in
which
it
operates.
now,
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
rule--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
as
long
as
the
limitation
on
area
did
not,
was
not
designed
to
shunt
the
devotees
into
places
where
in
effect
they
could
neither
be
seen
nor
heard,
as
long
as
in
effect
they
were
prevented
simply
from
blocking
access,
then
we
do
think
that
area
limitations,
as
have
been
upheld
before,
would
be
okay.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
excluded
from
other
booths?
i
suppose
interference
with
what's
going
on
in
other
booths
is
something--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
as
long
as
all
people
are
granted
some--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
that
probably
would
be
all
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
can
be
heard
and
seen,
but
that's
an
important,
i
think,
additional
point,
and
that
is,
we
suggested
that
the
primary
operation
of
the
booth
rule,
since
it's
so
obviously
overbroad
and
imprecise
with
respect
to
the
goals
of
fraud,
safety,
congestion,
and
the
like,
is
to
limit
distribution
and
receipt
of
religious
literature
and
solicitation
and
the
making
of
religious
contributions,
to
those
people
who
already
know
about,
feel
some
sympathy
toward,
and
are
willing
to
be
publicly
associated
with
the
very
kinds
of
groups
that
are
going
to
need
most
to
engage
in
a
kind
of
outreach
program.
and
the
response
of
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
to
the
suggestion
that
people
might
actually
feel
stigmatized
at
going
over
to
and
publicly
indicating
interest
in
the
hare
krishnas,
was
interesting.
their
response
is
that
it's
preposterous
to
suppose
any
such
thing,
page
15
of
their
brief;
that
alleged
fear,
they
say,
does
not
seem
to
prevent
fairgoers
from
going
to
the
carnival
freak
shows
and
similar
attractions.
that
is,
they
are
comparing
those
who
assert
fundamental
first
amendment
rights
to
freak
shows.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
to
some
extent.
but
if
they
persuade
too
effectively,
might
they
not
be
guilty
of
soliciting?
that
is,
as
this
court
thought
in
thomas
v.
collins,
there
may
not
be
any
very
bright
line
between
saying
the
union
is
your
only
real
source
of
protection
and
saying,
join
the
union.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
because...
i
don't
think
it
is
clear,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
reason
i
don't
is
that
just
as
this
court
in
primus
thought
that
a
representation
by
the
attorney
general
was
not
necessarily
conclusive
on
the
point
when
the
rule
itself
is
vague,
so,
too,
here,
if
someone
were
to
walk
around
and
say,
devotion
to
krishna
consciousness
means
sacrifice
of
the
material
things
to
which
you
are
enslaved,
and
that's
where
you
can
give
money,
it
would
not
at
all
surprise
me
if
that
were
to
be
regarded
as
solicitation.
but
i
think
there
is
a
dilemma
here.
because
if
that
is
not
a
forbidden
form
of
solicitation,
then
we
fail
to
understand
any
conceivable
purpose
that
can
be
served
by
banning
solicitation
and
not
banning
that
kind
of
advocacy.
that
is,
as
the
court
below
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
parts
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
not
just
the
exchange
of
money.
that
is,
this
court
has...
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
suggestion
that
although
the
solicitation
may
occur
out
in
the
fairground,
the
final
transaction
must
occur
in
the
booth.
that
was
the
compromise
suggested
by
the
dissenting
opinion,
and
that
is
the
solution
that
one
other
lower
federal
court
proposed.
what
is
proposed
and
defended
here
is
not
a
rule
that
you
can
say
anything
you
want
and
hand
out
literature
as
long
as
the
money
doesn't
change
except
back
at
the
booth.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
even
solicitation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
also,
but
also
solicitation.
that
is,
they
also
forbid
oral
as
well
as
written
solicitation
of
contributions
in
the
fairgrounds.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
he
probably
does
but
we
will
see.
that
is,
the
difference
between
us
is
on
what
constitutes
solicitation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
what
i'd
be
curious
to
know
is
whether
the
attorney
general
of
minnesota
can
square
with
this
record
the
proposition
that
if
the
devotees
of
the
krishna
society
were
specifically
to
say
orally
in
the
fairgrounds,
please
give
us
one
dollar,
whether
that
would
not
clearly
violate
this
rule?
we
believe
that
there's
no
doubt
on
this
record
that
it
would,
and
the
line
drawing--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
place
at
which
it
is
ultimately
given
determines
whether
the
solicitation
of
contributions
is
protected
or
unprotected.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
disagreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
stipulated
facts
say
that
soliciting
in
the
fairgrounds
is
forbidden
as
well
as--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--soliciting
for
contributions,
not
membership.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
apparently.
although
the
line
between
soliciting
for
support
and
soliciting
for
contributions
is
too
vague.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
says
it's
forbidden.
soliciting,
by
which
it
is
clear
is
meant
soliciting
for
contributions,
is
forbidden
in
the
fairgrounds
outside
a
booth,
and
the
entire
disagreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
below
is
whether
that
is
too
broad.
but
even
if
one
were
to
look
at
a
much
narrower
rule
that
says,
it's
okay
to
solicit
contributions
as
long
as
the
ultimate
donation
is
made
at
the
booth.
nothing
has
been
shown
here
to
justify
that.
there
is
speculation,
surely
not
meeting
this
court's
standard
in
thomas
v.
indiana
review
board,
that
maybe
there'd
be
some
confusion
if
money
were
to
change
hands
in
the
middle
of
a
fair.
well,
i
find
that
preposterous.
the
idea
that
it
would
be
confusing
or
a
source
of
congestion
for
people
to
hand
money
to
one
another
in
the
thoroughfares
of
a
state
fair
is
rather
hard
to
believe;
and
moreover,
the
notion
that
it
is
permissible
to
limit
donations
to
a
religion
to
those
people
who
are
willing
not
only
to
make
the
donation
but
walk
a
mile
in
order
to
make
it;
that
is,
go
all
the
way
over
to
the
booth
and
give
their
25
cents
or
one
dollar.
it's
also
incompatible
with
the
protected
nature
of
the
right
to
solicit
donations.
it's
as
though
we
were
to
tell
an
ordinary
church
that
it
couldn't
pass
a
collection
plate
but
could
only
take
pledges
for
remote
contributions.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yeah.
grabbing?
surely,
the
state
can
forbid
that.
and
in
this
case
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
right
the
respondents
seek
is
the
right
to
do
anything
coercive
or
intrusive.
there
is
no
denial
in
the
record
that
the
religion
in
question
teaches
that
that
kind
of
coercive
behavior
is
immoral
and
impermissible.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
are
four
sworn
affidavits
which
have
not
been
subjected
to
the
process
of
cross
examination
or
trial.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
we
think
that
the
issue
is
one
of
the
facial
validity
of
this
rule,
and
we
think
it
would
be
far
more
pernicious
to
sacrifice
the
principle
that
the
validity
of
the
rule
cannot
be
sustained
by
a
few
episodes,
even
if
true,
of
misconduct,
than
to
get
involved
in
a
sideshow
of
disputing
those
particular
episodes.
but
i
simply
point
out
that
it's
not
as
though
we
have
here
a
finding
by
the
courts
below
that
the
organization
is
guilty
of
some
kind
of
systematic
misconduct.
it's
not
as
though
we
have
a
record
on
the
basis
of
which
such
a
finding
could
be
made,
and
it's
not
as
though
we
have
a
rule
that
is
narrowly
targeted
to
any
kind
of
misconduct.
this
is
not
a
rule
which
specifically
forbids
particular
kinds
of
abusive
behavior.
this
is
a
rule
which
says,
you
can't
solicit
in
the
fairgrounds
at
all.
you
can't
distribute
or
exhibit
literature
in
the
fairgrounds
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
on
its
face
with
respect
to
a
certain
category
of
protected
behavior,
that
is,
we
don't
challenge
it--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
suppose
there
would
be
some...
well,
we're
all
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
distinction
this
court
drew
in
village
of
schaumberg
v.
citizens
for
a
better
environment
between
the
category
of
activities
as
applied
to
which
the
75
percent
rule
in
that
case
was
unconstitutional,
and
other
kinds
of
activities,
raising
money
for
more
conventional
charities
unconnected
with
advocacy
as
to
which
it
might
not
be
unconstitutional,
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
distinction
as
the
one
we
seek
to
draw
here.
that
is,
just
as
this
court
in
the
pair
of
cases
represented
by
martin
v.
struthers
and
breard
v.
alexandria,
suggested
that
it's
permissible
to
forbid
door
to
door
distribution
of
purely
commercial
material
but
not
permissible
to
do
so
with
respect
to
religion
and
politics,
so
that
kind
of
a
distinction,
we
think,
is
vital
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
think
it
would
be.
we
certainly
don't
challenge
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
minnesota
court's
opinion
said
that
it
could
not
constitutionally
be
applied
to
these
respondents.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
therefore,
that
it
was
not
valid--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--redraw
it
or
more
narrowly
construe
it.
that
is,
i
don't
think
that...
so,
this
court--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
do
it,
but
i
think
that
even
in
schaumberg--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
was
not
clear
that
one
had
to
go
back
to
a
legislative
drawing
board.
it
might
be
clearer
that
a
lower
court
might
be
able
to
redraw
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
don't
know
what
they
would
do.
as
matters
now
stood,
they
said
that
the
rule...
in
a
footnote
they
indicated
the
rule
could
constitutionally
be
applied
to
commercial
vendors
of
literature
and
of
other
materials.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
didn't
address
severability.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
they
did
not
strike
it
down
on
a
ground
as
broad
as
we
think
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
dissenting
justices
didn't
quite
agree.
justice
todd,
joined
by
two
other
members
of
that
court,
said
that
although
the
majority
might
not
have
adverted
to
it,
because
the
respondents
here
made
no
claim
for
some
special
treatment
and
because
no
principled
line
could
be
drawn
between
religion
and
politics
in
this
context,
indeed,
other
groups
would
be
exempt.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
except
the
majority
didn't
disagree.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
that
is
the
only
order
we
think
this
court
needs
to
affirm.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
insofar
as
that
made
it
easier
to
decide
the
case.
what
we
are--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
that
extent,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
it's
right
that
we
agree
that
no
principled
line
could
be
drawn
and
we
don't
urge
this
court
on
what
we
think
would
be
a
disingenuous
basis
to
uphold
what
would
be
a
very
narrow
decision.
we
think
it
really
is
broader,
broader
than
that,
necessarily.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
clearly
did
not
so
hold.
we
think
it
clearly
is,
however,
invalid
on
its
face.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
not...
i
don't
think
it
would
give
us
any
more
relief.
it
might
give
more
solace
to
a
number
of
other
organizations
that
believe
that
the
rule
inhibits
their
first
amendment
rights
and
because
we
are
making
an
overbroad
attack.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
an
ironic--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
the
answer
is
that
we
are
arguing
that
whether
or
not
all
of
the
activity
in
which
respondents
have
engaged
and
seek
to
engage
come
within
the
protected
core,
we
are
entitled
to
have
the
rule
struck
down
insofar
as
its
enforcement
against
us
with
respect
to
the
proposed
activities
is
contemplated.
in
that
sense,
even
though
clearly
we
are
not
among
the
many
other
organizations
whose
rights
we
would
seek
to
champion,
and
even
though
we
are
not,
as
perhaps
the
citizens
for
a
better
environment
was
in
the
schaumberg
case,
in
the
troublesome
position
of
not
even
being
able
to
plausibly
claim,
or
at
least
not
being
able
convincingly
to
show
that
we
are
likely
to
be
in
the
core,
we
are
not
invoking
overbreadth
out
of
necessity,
but
it's
not
a
gratuitous
invocation
because
we
do
think
it
important
to
explain
why
all
of
the
allegations
about
possible
misconduct
are
irrelevant.
they're
irrelevant
because
the
claim
made
here
is
that
it
would
not
be
constitutional
to
apply
the
booth
rule
to
prevent
the
activities
that
we
in
out
complaint
sought
to
engage
in.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
do
them
some
good,
but
they--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
would
much
rather
do
more.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
is
their
religious...
it
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
is
part
of
their
religious
mission,
but
it
would
not
be
incompatible
with
the
religion
if
that
was
the
best
that
one
could
possibly
do,
to
hand
out
literature
which
exposed
people
to
the
religion
and
informed
them
of
how
they
might
make
subsequent
contributions.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
