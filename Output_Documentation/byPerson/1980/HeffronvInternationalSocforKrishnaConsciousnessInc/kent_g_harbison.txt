mr.
kent
g.
harbison
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
kent
harbison
and
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
those
minnesota
officials
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
managing
the
annual
minnesota
state
fair.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
that
state
fair,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment,
may
enforce
a
rule
that
essentially
provides
that
all
those
persons
or
organizations
who
participate
in
the
annual
affair
who
desire
to
sell
products,
solicit
monetary
donations,
or
distribute
literature
or
any
other
materials,
whether
it
be
flags,
flowers,
or
whatever,
may
do
so,
but
only
from
rented
booths
or
similar
fixed
locations
on
the
ground.
this
case
began
in
august
of
1977
when
the
respondents,
the
krishna
society,
commenced
a
lawsuit
in
the
state
district
court
and
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
from
that
court
enjoining
the
fair
from
enforcing
that
rule
as
it
applies
to
them
during
that
year's
fair.
the
restraining
order,
however,
also
enjoined
the
krishnas
themselves
from
selling
any
of
these
items
that
i've
mentioned
on
a
peripatetic
basis
throughout
the
fairgrounds.
in
other
words,
the
effect
of
that
restraining
order
was
to
say,
the
state
fair
cannot
require
these
respondents
to
engage
in
these
activities
only
at
a
booth,
but
they
must
be
permitted
to
do
it
throughout
the
fairgrounds.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
since
that
restraining
order?
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
the
restraining
order
applied
to
the
'77
fair.
in
1978,
just
before
the
1978
fair,
the
state
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
state
fair.
therefore,
the
booth
rule
was
applied
during
the
1978
fair
because
the
state
had
received
a
favorable
decision.
that
was
then
appealed
by
the
respondents
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court
which
reversed
that
decision
in
a
5-to-3
opinion.
that
decision
did
not
come
down
until,
as
i
recall
it,
just
before
the
1980
fair.
this
court
then
accepted
the
case
to
review
it
in
january
of
this
year.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
they
did
not
have
a
booth
and
the
record
doesn't
indicate
whether
or
not
they
solicited
during
the
'78
or
'79
or
'80
fairs,
in
part
because
the
record,
the
trial
court
record
was
closed
at
that
time.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
i'll
attempt
to
see
if
i
can
add
some
definition
to
that.
the
policy
has
always
been,
not
just
at
that
time
or
even
now,
under
the
booth
rule...
and
that's
the
rule
we're
talking
about
here...
that
the
state
fair
would
not
try
to
prevent
anyone
from
engaging
in
oral
conversations,
and
the
phrase
"proselytizing",
the
way
i've
intended
to
use
it
in
the
brief
and
i
think
the
way
the
minnesota
supreme
court
viewed
it,
meant
the
practice
of
talking
to
someone
and
trying
to
convert
them
to
a
particular
group's
religious
or
political
beliefs.
that
statement
on
pages
35
and
36
is
not
meant
to
indicate
that
that's
somehow
a
change
of
policy.
that's
the
way
it
has
always
been
under
the
booth
rule.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
anyone,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--exactly
right,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
only
prerequisite
to
gaining
entrance
to
access
inside
the
fairgrounds
is
the
payment
of
a
customary
admission
fee.
that's
the
only
prerequisite.
once
a
person
gets
into
the
fairgrounds,
the
booth
rule
has
no
relationship
to
them
whatsoever
so
long
as
they
engage
in
the
activities
you're
describing.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
so
long
as
they
don't
try
to
collect
money
or
sell
things
or
distribute
things
in
that
connection.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
that
he
may
not
distribute
literature
or
any
other
kinds
of
materials.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
and
part
of
the
reason
as
indicated
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
with
respect
to
these
respondents...
and
i
think
they
indicate
this
in
paragraph
11
of
the
stipulation...
that
they
don't
merely
want
to
just
distribute
the
flowers
and
the
books
and
the
magazines
and
the
buttons
or
whatever
it
may
be,
but
indeed,
they
want
to
collect
money
for
them.
so
there
is
always
the
monetary
exchange
that
accompanies
that
sort
of
activity.
i'd
like
to
give
the
court
a
little
bit
of
a
factual
outline
of
what
the
fair
is
like
and
the
types
of
crowds
and
congestion
that
we're
describing
in
our
brief.
the
fair
is
held
every
year
for
a
12-day
period
in
a
permanently
enclosed
fairgrounds
occupying
about
125
acres
in
st.
paul,
minnesota.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
only
about
40
to
45
of
those
acres,
or
about
one
third
of
that
area,
comprises
that
part
of
the
fairgrounds
where
most
of
the
booth
operations
and
the
fairgoing
traffic
occurs.
the
rest
of
it
is
parking
lots
and
storage
facilities
and
so
forth.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
there's
a
racetrack,
your
honor.
there's
a
racetrack
that's
connected
with
the
grandstand
that...
i
don't
think
the
record
indicates...
but
it
seats
several
thousand
people.
there
are
in
an
average
year
more
than
1.3
million
people
who
attend
this
12-day
event
and
i
emphasize
it's
not
merely
just
a
location,
but
it
is
an
event
that
the
state
stages
for
a
limited
period
each
year.
that
breaks
down
to
about
115,000
people
per
day
during
the
week
in
this
40-to-45
acre
area,
and
approximately
160,000
people
per
day
on
weekends.
and
as
i
said,
the
only
requirement
for
those
people
to
get
into
the
fairgrounds
is
if
they
pay
the
customary
admission
fee.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
i
personally
don't
know
that
and
i
don't
the
record
indicates
that
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
minnesota
state
fair
has
for
many
years
been
among
the
top
two
or
three
state
fairs
in
the
country
in
terms
of
size
and
number
of
fairgoers.
the
booth
rule
that
were
talking
about
is
an
inherent
inseparable
part
of
the
state
fair,
and
that's
in
part
because
the
state
fair
has
a
system
called
the
space
rental
system.
and
under
that
the
state
fair
enters
into
lease
agreements
with
all
these
organizations
and
people
who
desire
to
sell
and
solicit
and
distribute
materials.
under
these
lease
agreements
these
people
and
organizations
are
required
to
conduct
these
activities
at
a
booth
that
requires
them
to
post
an
identification
sign
that
clearly
in
some
manner
informs
the
fairgoing
public
as
to
who
they
are
or
at
least
gives
them
some
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
booth
operation.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
yes,
your
honor.
the
booth
rule
in
a
sense
is
somewhat
of
a
misnomer
in
that
we're
not
talking
only
about
little
stands
and
booths
but
i
am
using
the
term
to
mean
fixed
locations
generally.
sometimes
it's
inside
buildings,
sometimes
it's
a
location
known
as
machinery
hill
that
perhaps
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
these
are
all
organizations
that
have
rented
booths
for
a
number
of
years
from
the
state
fair.
in
fact,
there
are
approximately
1,400
booth
operations
on
the
fairgrounds
during
the
period
covered
by
this
case,
and
these
organizations
that
you're
referring
to,
your
honor,
represent
at
least
40
of
the
organizations
who
at
the
time
were
considered
to
qualify
probably
as
religious
or
political
or
news
media
type
organizations.
i
think
under
the
respondents'
current
proposal
in
their
brief,
that
this
be
expanded
to
include
charitable
and
noncommercial
organizations
as
well.
i
think
it's
likely
that
a
significant
number,
in
addition
to
these,
of
the
1,400
booth
operators
would
qualify
under
that
definition,
whatever
the
definition
may
be.
but
the
rule,
again,
doesn't
have
any
effect
whatsoever
on
the
ability
or
the
right
of
anyone
to
engage
in
some
communications
or
proselytizing,
however
you
want
to
phrase
it.
it
relates
primarily
to
the
distribution
and
the
monetary
activities.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
a
religious
organization
whose
members
engage
in
an
activity
known
as
sankirtan.
that
consists
of
a
number
of
aspects,
singing,
dancing,
chanting,
selling
not
only
books
but
other
tokens,
and
soliciting
donations.
the
first
aspects
of
that,
the
first
three,
the
singing,
dancing,
and
chanting,
the
respondents
don't
claim
or
aren't
pressing
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
we're
aware
of
as
covered
by
their
first
amendment
arguments.
in
other
words,
they're
not...
perhaps
they
would
be
covered
by
it,
i
suppose,
but
they're
not
pressing
those
claims.
we're
only
worried
about
the
latter
three.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
they
would
not
be
able
to
do
that,
i
think.
and
not
only
so
much
because
of
the
booth
rule
but
because
of
the
state
fair
management's
inherent
responsibility,
as
this
court
recognized
in
cox
v.
new
hampshire,
which
involved
public
streets,
the
responsibility
to
maintain
some
order
so
that
they're
not
overlapping
parades,
if
you
will.
and
i
suggest
that
in
this
case
there
is
even
more
evidence
than
there
was
in
cox
v.
new
hampshire
that
that
sort
of
conflict
would
be
posed.
the
state
fair
would
have
a
right
and
an
obligation,
in
fact,
to
the
public
to
control
that
sort
of
activity.
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
couldn't
occur.
it
just
means
it
would
have
to
be
done
in
an
orderly
fashion
so
that
there
would
be
some
order
in
an
already
crowded
area,
40
to
45
acres,
which
on
a
typical
day
would
have
between
100,000
and
200,000
people.
i'd
like
to
mention
one
more
factual
point
here,
i
think
that
is
of
interest
to
this
case,
and
that
is,
after
the
1977
restraining
order,
there
were
about
17
or
18
members
of
iskcon
or
krishnas
who
did
participate
in
the
fair
and
engage
in
these
activities
outside
the
confines
of
a
booth.
that
was
consistent
with
the
restraining
order.
what
was
not
consistent,
however,
was
the
fact
that
they
did
sell,
they
did
engage
in
sales.
the
restraining
order
basically
said
that
if
you
wish
to
sell
something
you
still
have
to
do
that
from
a
booth,
but
the
other
aspects
of
the
booth
rule
we
enjoin...
the
court,
meaning
"we"...
enjoin
as
to
the
krishnas.
in
addition,
the
record
shows
that
even
just
during
this
five
or
six
day
period
when
these
sales
and
solicitations
were
taking
place,
the
krishnas
represented...
i
should
say,
misrepresented
themselves
to
the
potential
donors
and
purchasers,
indicating
that
they
represented
something
called
the
division
of
natural
resources,
and
schools
for
needy
and
handicapped
children,
drug
treatment
programs,
and
indeed
the
state
fair
itself.
and
there
is
also
evidence
that
these
sorts
of
things
took
place
with
respect
to
donors
who
were
minors.
it's
been
suggested
by
the
respondents
that
this
booth
rule
is
a
totally
preclusive
regulation,
and
it
strikes
me
that
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
ever
to
have
any
sort
of
regulations
that
weren't
preclusive
in
some
way,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
apply
the
balancing
test,
the
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
test,
because
there
was
always
going
to
be
some
preclusion.
in
fact,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
alternative
suggested
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
by
the
respondents
themselves
as
alleging,
allegedly,
less
restrictive
alternatives.
they
themselves
involve
some
preclusive
aspects
and
again,
the
booth
rule,
not
only
does
and
doesn't
do
what
i've
already
discussed,
but
it
doesn't
give
the
state
fair
or
any
state
official
any
discretion
whatsoever
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
shall
abide
by
the
rule
or
whether
they
shall
not.
it's
applied
nondiscriminatorily
on
its
face,
and
as
applied
it
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to
the
ideology
or
the
content
of
anyone's
political
or
religious
beliefs.
and
as
i
said,
it
doesn't
prohibit
any
sort
of
oral
proselytizing
or
oral
conversations
at
all.
one
of
the
things
at
this
stage
of
the
case
that
i
think
is
critical
is
that
the
respondents
have
now
abandoned
what
i
believe
to
be
the
basis,
the
key
basis,
for
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
decision.
that
is,
they're
no
longer
making
a
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
single
exemption
from
the
booth
rule
because
of
some
unique
status
that
they
have
because
of
this
practice
of
sankirtan.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
it
may
be
overstating
it
to
say
they
have
totally
abandoned
it.
it
sounds
to
me
in
their
brief
now
as
if
they're
making
some
sort
of
an
alternative
argument.
but
what
sticks
out
to
me,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
i
think
they
are
recognizing
that
those
aspects
of
ankirtan
that
involve
religious
solicitations
or
whatever
are
no
different
than
those
of
any
other
political
or
religious
organization.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
exactly,
your
honor,
and
that's
my
point.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
pardon
me?
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
the
free
exercise
rights
could
be
elevated
over
free
speech
or
free
association
rights.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
there
are
absolutely
no
exceptions
to
the
booth
rule
with
respect
to
the
sales
and
monetary
exchanges
and
distributions
of
materials.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
in
this
case
it's
important.
it
still
has
a
relevance.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
stickers
or--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
but
in
this
case
there
is
still
some
relevance
regarding
the
control
on
fraudulent
practices.
because
if
you
look
at
the
record,
and
even
the
stipulation,
again,
in
paragraph
11,
the
respondents
don't
merely
want
to
just
distribute
the
books
or
the
flowers
or
the
incense
or
the
flags.
they
want
to
get
money
for
them.
now,
whether
that
call
that
a
sale
or
a
donation,
it's
not
just
a
pure
distribution
activity.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
money
involved,
your
honor,
and
the
record
already
indicates
that
they
have
in
getting
this
money
have
represented
themselves
to
be
agents
of
organizations
for
which
they
are
not.
and
beyond
that,
with
respect--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--your
honor,
they
could
do
that
in
a
booth
and
we
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
deceptive
sales
don't
take
place
at
booths,
they
surely
do.
but
what
the
booth
rule
does
is
provide
some
accountability,
some
control
of
the
fair,
because
the
booth
operators
have
a
contract
with
the
fair,
the
fair
knows
who
the
owners
and
operators
of
the
booth
are,
they
know
where
they're
located,
the
booths
must
have
identification
signs
identifying
who
they
are
and
what
their
purposes
are.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
in
a
pure
distribution
setting
without
any
monetary
exchange
that
it's
still
possible
to
have
some
misrepresentation
as
to
what
it
is,
whether
it
be
a
record,
as
it
was
in
the
new
york
case,
or--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--i
think,
your
honor,
it's
still
possible
to
have
that
but
beyond
that
there
are
other
public
purposes
that
this
booth
rule
serves.
and
in
fact,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
expressly
found
that
even
the
public
purpose,
the
governmental
interest
of
providing
order
and
in
traffic
control
and
minimizing
congestion
in
an
already
crowded
place
is
a
substantial
governmental
interest
that
is
significantly
furthered
by
the
booth
rule.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
littering
would
be
a
problem
under
that,
but
we
don't
advance
that
as
a
justification
for
the
rule.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
we
wouldn't
have
egresses
i
suppose,
your
honor.
well,
i
think...
we
know
that,
we
recognize
that,
your
honor.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
to
the
extent
that
happens,
and
we
acknowledge
it,
the
state
fair
is
more
able
to
control
that
sort
of
thing
at
a
booth
because
they
know
who
the
people
are.
but,
if
one
has
a
roving
solicitor
or
vendor
walking
among
150,000,
200,000
people
on
a
given
day,
in
a
40
to
45-acre
area,
and
sells
somebody
a
record
that's
supposed
to
be
a
religious
record
and
it
turns
out
to
be
something
totally
different,
or
any
other
example,
by
the
time
that
the
purchaser
or
the
donor
is
aware
of
that,
there's
no
way
you
can
do
anything
about
it.
now,
it
might
be
a
little
bit
easier
to
pick
out
somebody
in
this
kind
of
a
crowd
if
they
somehow
appeared
unique,
but
the
indications
are
that
these
roving
vendors
and
solicitors
look
pretty
much
like
everyone
else.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
with
respect
to
the
overbreadth
attack
even,
it
seems
to
me,
under
this
court's
decisions
such
as
in
broadrick,
even
in
first
amendment
cases,
that
should
not
automatically
be
applied
and
in
fact,
i
think,
the
phrase,
"substantial"--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
just
one
component
of
it.
but
beyond
that--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--our
argument
is
that
it...
especially
in
contrast
with
the
way
the
fairgrounds
and
the
fair
is
set
up
now,
if
you
have
someone
walking
around
the
fairgrounds
handing
out
materials...
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
start
drawing
lines
between
the
kinds
of
things
that
would
be
distributed,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
had
that
sort
of
activity
going
on
with
not
just
the
krishnas
but
10
or
20
or
30
representatives
from
perhaps
30
to
60
or
70
groups,
that
inevitably
is
going
to
draw
more
attention
and
going
to
cause
or
create
more
or
less
moving
pockets
or
moving
congested
crowds,
because
of
the
fact
that
someone
is
doing
something
unique
on
the
fairgrounds,
especially
giving
something
away
free,
i
think
that's
going
to--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--your
honor,
but
my
point
would
be,
with
respect
to
that,
that
those
fairgoers
may
not
know
that
right
away
until
they
actually
get
up
there
and
receive
it,
but
if
all
of
a
sudden
the
crowd
becomes
aware
of
the
fact
that
dozens
of
people
are
walking
around
passing
out
materials
and
they're
going
to
inevitably
be
attracted
by
that.
whereas,
they
wouldn't
be
if
people
were
just
talking.
that's
how--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--your
honor,
that
sort
of
thing,
to
my
knowledge
of
the
record,
hasn't
happened,
and
my
point
would
be
that
the
booth
rule
doesn't
have
to
be
perfect.
what
it
has
to
be
is
a
reasonable
attempt
to
accommodate
a
number
of
conflicting
interests.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
also
related,
i
would
think,
to
the
protection
of
the
fairgoers'
rights
of
privacy
themselves,
particularly
when
we're
talking
about
the
potential
of
dozens
or
maybe
several
hundred
solicitors.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
if
the
record
indicates
that,
but
to
my
knowledge
it
was
sometime
in
may
or
june
of
1977.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
this
booth
rule
has
been
in
existence
since
1966,
at
least,
and
that's
before
the
krishnas
were
even
in
this
country.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
absolutely
nothing.
in
fact,
your
honor,
they
did
not
apply
for
booth
space.
they
were
informed
that
the
booth
rule
existed
and
they
informed
the
fair
that
they
didn't
feel
they
had
to
submit
to
it.
i'd
like
to
make
one
comment
about
another
argument
that's
raised
in
the
respondents'
brief,
and
that
is
that
the
primary
purpose,
despite
what
i've
just
gone
through
on
these
other
purposes,
the
primary
purpose
of
this
rule
is
alleged
to
be
to
insulate
potentially
receptive
listeners
or
audiences
from
all
communications.
they
have
to
take
some
affirmative
step.
that
is
just
plain
wrong.
first,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
implicit
in
that
some
sort
of
improper
motivation
and
i
think
the
comment
i
just
made
about
when
the
booth
rule
was
enacted
cuts
against
that.
but,
the
only
difference
with
respect
to
that
context,
the
only
difference
between
a
booth
operator
and
a
roving
vendor
is
the
ability
to
pursue
and
follow
an
unwilling
audience
or
listener
or
purchaser
or
donor.
a
booth
operator
cannot
go
after
a
fairgoer
who
walks
by
the
booth
and
declines
the
sales
pitch
or
the
solicitation.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
it
doesn't
show,
your
honor.
but
i
would
think
that
under
the
booth
rule
it's
pretty
clear
that
whether
they're
standing
in
front
of
it
or
behind
it
they've
got
to
stay
generally
in
that
location.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
the
state
of
minnesota
does,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
this
is,
your
honor.
the
record
is
pretty
much
silent
on
that
but
to
my
knowledge
the
state
fair
does
not
even
receive
a
legislative
appropriation
from
the
state
of
minnesota.
it's
a
self--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--sustaining,
self
supporting
enterprise.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
your
honor,
i
don't
know
and
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that.
i
am
sure
the
total
gross
revenues...
and
i
don't
know
how
it
would
be
broken
down,
would
be
well
over
a
million
dollars.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
one
final
point
here
and
then
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
and
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
booth
rule
does
not
prohibit
booth
operators
from
talking
to
fairgoers
as
they
walk
around,
or
trying
to
sell
them
something
or
solicit
donations.
roving
solicitors
simply
have
moving
booths,
that's
all
it
is.
but
the
booth
operator
doesn't
have
the
advantage
to
follow,
pursue,
harass,
however
you'd
like
to
characterize
it,
fairgoers
who
aren't
interested.
and
i
submit
that's
not
enough
of
a
justification.
the
alternatives
to
the
booth
rule
that
are
alleged
to
be
less
restrictive
are
both
unworkable
and
i
suspect
constitutionally
suspect
because
they
would
turn
what
is
now
a
a
non
content
directed
rule
into
a
regulation
that
inherently
is
going
to
require
the
state
fair
to
look
into
the
content
and
the
religious
basis
of
the
organizations.
they're
suggesting
that
the
state
fair
could
do
this
by
registering
all
organizations
who
are
charitable
or
noncommercial,
whomever
they
may
be.
the
problem
with
that
is,
how
does
the
fair
determine
that?
that
sounds
to
me
like
the
kind
of
regulation
this
court
struck
down
in
cantwell
v.
connecticut.
i
don't
think
the
state
fair,
even
if
they're
qualified,
would
constitutionally
be
able
to
do
that.
the
numerical
limitations
that
have
been
suggested,
the
requirement
to
wear
identification
badges,
sound
nice
in
the
abstract
but
in
practice
they
wouldn't
work;
the
state
fair
would
have
no
way
to
guarantee
that
they
were
being
complied
with.
what
we
have
here
is
not
an
attempt
to
suppress
communication
but
an
attempt
by
the
state
fair
along
this
less
restrictive
continuum
to
draw
the
line.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
i'd
like
to
take
up,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
that
very
point.
under
minnesota
statutes,
every
law
in
minnesota
is
severable
unless
it's
expressly
provided
not
to
be.
furthermore,
the
comment
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
suggested
some
lesser
restrictive
alternatives
to
the
rule
has
to
be
taken
with
the
understanding
that
their
decision
was
based
upon
the
assumption
that
they
were
dealing
only
with
one
organization,
not
with
potentially
30,
40,
50,
100,
whatever
it
might
be.
i
suggest
that
in
light
of
the
fact
that
they
found
substantial
public
purposes
furthered
by
the
rule,
they
would
have
concluded
very
likely
that
in
a
different
way,
because
their
allegedly
less
restrictive
alternatives
would
not
fit
in
the
same
context.
so
the
basis
for
those
alternatives
is
no
longer
there.
without
the
booth
rule
i'm
suggesting
that
the
entire
nature
of
the
state
fair
would
be
changed
drastically
and
that's
one
of
the
factors
this
court
has
typically
looked
at,
the
nature
of
the
forum
here.
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
the
event
of
the
annual
state
fair
is
not
on
the
same
plane,
it's
not
the
same
as
a
public
park
or
a
public
street
corner.
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
i
think
the
literal
language
of
it
on
the
face
would
indicate
that,
but
it's
never
been
applied
outside
the
booth
context
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court
interpretive--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--no,
your
honor,
there
are
no
roving--
mr.
kent
g.
harbison
--sales
activities
whatsoever.
thank
you.
