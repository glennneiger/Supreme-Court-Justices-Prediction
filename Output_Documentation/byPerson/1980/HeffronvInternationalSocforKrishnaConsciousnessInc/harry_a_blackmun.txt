justice

mr.
harbison,
does
the
record
show
what
happened
in
succeeding
years?
justice
blackmun
you
spoke
of
the
1977
fair.
what
about
'78,
'79,
'80?
justice
blackmun
well,
let
me
ask
specifically,
did
the
krishna
group
have
a
booth
in
'78,
'79,
or
'80,
and
did
they
solicit
at
all
on
the
grounds
during
those
years?
justice
blackmun
mr.
tribe,
i
think
a
minute
ago
you
conceded
that
a
reasonable
limitation
on
numbers
would
be
constitutional?
justice
blackmun
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
a
reasonable
limitation
on
area?
justice
blackmun
well,
certainly,
they
can
be
heard
and
seen
in
a
booth
that
they
have.
