justice
white
well,
but,
it
does
prevent
the
distribution
of
any
piece
of
paper?
if
the
man...
if
one
of
the
solicitors
makes
a
speech
to
somebody,
which
you
say
he
can
do,
but
then
says,
here's
a
copy
of
what
i
said,
he
may
not
do
that?
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
white
or
a
candidate
for
a
political
office?
justice
white
or
a
candidate
for
a
political
office,
i
suppose.
justice
white
--well,
you...
i
take
it
that
if
the
county
officer
who
is
running
for
office
puts
a
sign
on
his
back,
vote
for
me,
with
his
picture
on,
or
on
his
hat,
on
his
straw
hat,
you'd
let
him
do
that,
and
you'd
let
him
stop
people
and
try
them
into
voting
for
him.
and
it
might
even
be
that
it
would
be
simpler
to
let
him
pass
out
a
card
rather
than
to
try
to
buttonhole
people
and
talk
to
them.
justice
white
well,
mr.
tribe,
would
you
think
the
fair
could
say,
well,
there's
150,000
a
day,
perhaps
we
could
put
up
with
500
wandering
people
who
are
soliciting
and
we'll
put
the
names
in
a
hat
and
draw
by
lot
as
to
who
gets
in
that
day?
justice
white
well,
what
about...
what
if
they
were
excluded
from
other
booths?
justice
white
well,
i
mean,
just
keep
them
out.
say,
if
they're
permitted
to
solicit,
or...
you
cannot
solicit
in
somebody
else's
booth?
justice
white
or
in
somebody
else's...
or
in
the
queues
lined
up
at
somebody
else's
booth?
justice
white
well,
what's
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
is
forbidden?
justice
white
well,
that's
not
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
white
just
tell
me
what's
in
the
record.
justice
white
but
not
soliciting
for
membership?
justice
white
so
you
can
solicit
for
support?
justice
white
so
there's
nothing
in
the
argument,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
any
more
than
that.
to
say
that
soliciting...
does
the
stipulation
say
it's
permitted
or
forbidden?
justice
white
well,
what
did
the...
didn't
the
minnesota
court
strike
it
down
on
its
face?
justice
white
and
therefore
what?
justice
white
isn't
your
overbreadth
argument,
though,
isn't
the
bottom
line
that
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
that
if
they
want
to
apply
it
to
a
permissible
category
of
activity,
they
should
redraw
it?
justice
white
we
can't
do
that.
they
can't
proceed--
justice
white
--oh,
yes.
justice
white
so...
but
you
don't
know
what
the
minnesota
court
did?
justice
white
did
they
say
whether
the
ordinance
was
severable
in
the
sense?
justice
white
would
it
give
you
more
relief
than
you
got
if
it
were
stricken
down
on
its
face?
justice
white
well,
why
are
you
entitled
to
urge
us
to
declare
it
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
as
long
as
it's
unconstitutional
as
to
you?
