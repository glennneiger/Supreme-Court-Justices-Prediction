that
is,
other
fairgoers
could?
justice
stewart
or
anybody
inside
the
premises
could
try
to
convince
anybody
else
of
the
wisdom
of
his
religious
or
other
ideological
beliefs
and
direct
such
a
person
to
the
krishna
booth?
justice
stewart
so
long
as
they
don't
try
to
collect
money
or
sell
something?
justice
stewart
so,
in
short,
your
answer
to
my
brother
stevens,
i
gather,
is
you
justify
it
on
the
basis
of
crowd
control
or
traffic
control.
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
who
owns
the
fairgrounds?
justice
stewart
is
this
a...
and
the
booth
rule
involves
the
charge
of
rentals
for
the
booths,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
is
this
a
revenue
raising
measure
of
any
consequence?
justice
stewart
self-supporting?
justice
stewart
and
how
much
is
raised
by
these
booth
rentals?
justice
stewart
well,
isn't
every
prospective
booth
renter's
behavior
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
aren't
we
all,
in
other
words?
justice
stewart
yes.
justice
stewart
so
this
booth
rule
might,
you
think,
be
constitutionally
valid
as
it
applied
to
purely
commercial
booth
renters?
justice
stewart
and
you
agree
with
that?
i'm
not
sure
that
the
dissenting
opinion
is
the
best
guide
as
to
what
the
majority
meant.
