we'll

mr.

chief
justice

what
else
is
there?
an
athletic
field?
or
a
racetrack,
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
burger
has
it
always
been
that
size,
or
was
it
expanded
after
the
automobile
age
came
along?
chief
justice
burger
when
you
speak
of
the
booths,
are
you
including
under
that
term
the
halls
and
areas
where
they
have
farm
machinery
and
other
machinery?
chief
justice
burger
suppose
the
american
legion
drum
and
bugle
corps
wanted
to
have
a
parade
through
the
streets
and
through
the
area
to
stimulate
patriotic
reactions,
could
they
do
that
under
these
regulations?
chief
justice
burger
do
the
candidates
and
the
parties
have
booths?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
wish
to
save
any
rebuttal
time,
this
is
the
time
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
burger
do
we
have
to
decide
that
issue
here?
chief
justice
burger
when
someone
puts
one
of
these
boards
on
back
and
front
like
advertising
for
a
restaurant,
then
we'll
decide
that
case.
chief
justice
burger
but
aren't
there
going
to
be
a
large
number
of
people,
as
suggested
in
justice
todd's
dissent,
at
a-73
of
the
joint
appendix,
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
make
the
same
claim
as
your
clients,
that
they
should
be
able
to
freely
roam
and
proselytize?
and
he
comments
there
that
under
the
existing
rule
fair
officials
cannot
arbitrarily
determine
that
some
exhibitors
are
free
to
roam
the
fair
grounds
while
others
are
not.
chief
justice
burger
but
when
you
have
it
in
the
record,
all
that
list
of
people
who
have
previously
paid
for
booths,
presumably
all
of
them
would
do
the
same
thing
your
clients
have
done.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
tribe,
i
read
recently,
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
vouch
for
what
i
read
in
the
newspaper,
but
it
suggested
that
there
were
153
religious
organizations
in
the
state
of
california
alone
that
would
qualify
under
this
category.
now
assume
that's
very
high.
could
we
take
judicial
notice,
do
you
think,
that
there
must
be
at
least
100
religious
organizations
in
the
united
states
that
could
avail
themselves
of
what
you
are
urging?
chief
justice
burger
well,
would
people
be
permitted
to
walk
around
this
courtroom
of
any
courtroom?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
out
in
the
halls,
where
we
have
exhibits,
and
the
museum
downstairs?
chief
justice
burger
is
not
a
state
fair
fundamentally
an
educational
function
and
in
a
state
like
minnesota,
agriculture
and
agricultural
machinery,
and
a
great
many
other
things?
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
lower
great
hall
here,
to
pursue
that,
is
a
museum
of
sorts
and
people
look
at
the
pictures
of
the
justices
of
times
gone
by
and
read
their
biographies
attached,
and
look
at
a
great
many
things
relating
to
the
court's
history.
they
are
free
to
talk
about
it
all
they
want
as
long
as
they
don't
create
a
disturbance.
how
would
the
peripatetic
missionary
be
any
more
or
less
a
problem
downstairs
than
at
the
state
fair?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
