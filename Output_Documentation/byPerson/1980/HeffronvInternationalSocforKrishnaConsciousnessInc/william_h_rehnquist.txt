justice
rehnquist
mr.
harbison,
following
up
on
justice
blackmun's
question,
at
pages
35
and
36
of
your
brief,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
you
make
the
statement,
"in
fact,
even
under
current
state
fair
policy,
krishnas
could
proselytize
among
and
speak
with
fairgoers
and
then
direct
interested
donors
or
purchasers
to
their
booth.
"
now,
does
that
represent
a
change
in
the
regulation
or
does
that
represent
your
definition
of
proselytize
as
opposed
to
solicit?
the
words
"proselytize"
and
"solicit"
have
been
used
kind
of
interchangeably
and
confusingly,
given
all
the
court
opinions
and
briefs
in
the
case.
justice
rehnquist
how
many
acres
of
that
are
actually
devoted
to
booths?
justice
rehnquist
is
the
statement
in
your
joint
appendix
at
a-49...
a-52
listing
all
the
organizations,
the
seventh
day
adventists,
the
lutheran
council,
abortion
rights
council,
the
american
association
for
retired
persons,
et
cetera,
are
those
all
people
who
have
rented
booths?
justice
rehnquist
well,
at
page
47
of
their
brief
they
say,
"respondents
seek
no
unique
treatment
within
this
category.
"
i
would
take
that
to
mean
that
they
would
agree
that
other
organizations
should
be
treated
the
same
as
they
should.
justice
rehnquist
well,
p.
t.
barnum
would
roll
over
in
his
grave
if
deception
were
absolutely
prohibited
at
state
fairs.
p.
t.
barnum
wouldn't
be
the
only
one.
justice
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
whether
barkers
are
permitted
outside
of
the
booths
or
inside
the
booths?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
that
minnesota
was
a
cool
state.
justice
rehnquist
that
to
me
isn't
a
specter.
i
mean,
the
primary
purpose
of
state
fairs
in
their
origin
was
pie
contests
and
corn
contests
and
so
forth.
justice
rehnquist
what?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you
have
all
of
these
roving
groups
around
the
pedestrian
malls,
they
will
come
to
take
over
the
state
fair
and
the
kind
of
agricultural
aspect
of
the
thing
will
totally
disappear.
justice
rehnquist
what
about
the
new
york
district
court
ruling?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
a
fairground
a
"marketplace
of
ideas"
as
much
as
a
marketplace
for
wares?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
we
felt
bound
by
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota's
decision,
presumably
we
would
not
have
granted
certiorari.
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
this
be
different
if
it
came
from
the
8th
circuit
rather
than
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota?
justice
rehnquist
on
page
35
and
36
of
his
brief
he
says,
"in
fact,
even
under
current
state
fair
policy,
krishnas
could
proselytize
among
and
speak
with
fairgoers
and
then
direct
interested
donors
or
purchasers
to
their
booth.
"
justice
rehnquist
even
if
they
said,
give
it
at
the
booth?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
state
is
forbidden
from
enacting
an
ordinance
that
prohibits
a
devotee
of
a
religion
from
suddenly
grabbing
a
pedestrian
off
the
mall
and
saying,
listen,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
my
religion
for
three
or
four
minutes.
you
stay
here
and
listen
to
me.
justice
rehnquist
but
there
are
also
affidavits
of
some
misrepresentation.
justice
rehnquist
were
you
denied...
did
you
request
and
were
denied
that
opportunity?
justice
rehnquist
so
is
it
your
position
that
the
rule,
the
booth
rule,
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
