justice
jr.
you
mean
they've
abandoned
the
sankirtan
argument,
do
you
think?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
your
justifications
have
been,
as
i
recall
it,
safety
and
the
prevention
of
fraudulent
practices.
on
the
latter,
prevention
of
fraudulent
practices,
how
does
a
prohibition
against
distribution
of
literature
further
that
interest?
i'm
not
speaking
now
of
the
fund
raising
but
the
distribution
of--
justice
jr.
--i
gather
a
political
candidate
can't
distribute
a
little--
justice
jr.
--sticker;
whatever.
justice
jr.
well,
i
don't
quite...
how
does
that
make
it
fraudulent?
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
harbison,
your
answer
to
me
is
that
prevention
of
deceptive
practices
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
circulars
and
that
sort
of
thing,
is
only
when
joined
with
effort
to
sell.
is
that
it?
i
mean,
the
political
candidate
who
does
nothing
but
pass
them
around,
you
would
not
defend
that
as
necessary
to?
justice
jr.
well,
again,
i
go
to
the
political
candidate.
he
just
wants
to
hand
out
something
with
his
picture
on
it
and
something
about
his
biography
or
something
like
that.
justice
jr.
how
about
littering?
is
there
any?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
harbison,
when
did
the
krishnas
first
request
booth
space
at
this
fair?
justice
jr.
and
was
this
after
this
booth
rule
had
first
been
promulgated?
justice
jr.
so
that
at
least
its
promulgation
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
arrival
of
the
krishnas?
justice
jr.
mr.
tribe,
did
i
understand
you
just
to
suggest
that
you've
abandoned
the
uniqueness,
sankirtan
argument?
justice
jr.
your
position
now
is
not
that
you're
entitled
to
special
consideration
based
on
the
sankirtan
argument,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
this
booth
rule
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
arrival,
chronologically,
with
the?
justice
jr.
overbreadth
usually
applies
when
it's
not
unconstitutional
as
to
you
but
it
may
be
as
to
others,
doesn't
it?
