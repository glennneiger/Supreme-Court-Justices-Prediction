paul

do
you
contend,
mr.
goldberg,
that
the
reasoning
of
this
recent
order
would
have
applied
if
they
had
asked,
or
if
they'd
filed
back
in
1962
or
'63?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
think
the
reasoning
of
this
order
would
have
applied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
based
on
the
fact
that
they
were
so
late.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
came
in
'62
and
said,
we
want
to
get
the
higher
rate
for
the
period
'62
to
'72,
the
next
ten
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
know
whether
the
commission
would
have
let
them
do
it
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
deny
that
it
was
at
least
possible
the
commission
would
have
let
them
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
doesn't
that
mean
that
it
was
at
least
a
possibility
that
it
would
have
been
done
had
they
been
able
to
act
promptly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
who's
responsible
for
the
fact
that
they
were
unable
to
go
in
in
'62?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
read
the
contract
the
other
way.
now,
that
depends
on
how
one
reads
the
contract.
but
if
we
assume
that
the
louisiana
court
correctly
reads
the
contract
and
that
you
did
have
a
duty
to
notify
them,
then
are
you
not
responsible
for
the
delay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
court
said,
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
we
think
it's
more
likely
they
would
than
they
would
have
not.
and
as
i
understand,
the
commission
said,
well,
we
don't
know
what
we
would
have
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
all
i
asked
you
was
whether
or
not
it
were
possible
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
could
have
ruled
in
favor
of
allowing
the
higher
rate,
back
if
they'd
made
a
timely
filing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us
we
assume
for
purposes
of
whether
the
filed
rate
doctrine
applies
or
not
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
favored
nations
agreement,
the
duty
and
all
the
rest.
and
you
argue,
well,
nevertheless,
the
filed
rate
doctrine
precludes
the
higher
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
correct
that
that
case
really
just
held
that
that
precluded
them
from
having
a
claim
under
the
federal
statute.
it
didn't
really
decide
whether
there
might
a
state
law
claim
of
some
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
case
did
arise
in
the
federal
judicial
system
and
the
first
question
is
whether
federal
jurisdiction--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
not
have
maintained
an
action
for
violation
of
the
federal
power
act
in
the
state
court
but
the
court
really
didn't
have
any
occasion
to
decide
whether
there
was
any
breach
of
fiduciary
relationship
that
might
give
rise
to
a
common
law
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
wasn't
before
the
court.
