mr.
james
fleet
howell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondents
respectfully
submit
that
the
core
fundamental
issue
presented
in
this
case
involves
the
separate
and
independent
obligation
of
the
petitioner
herein,
arkansas
louisiana
gas
company,
to
respond
in
compensatory
damages
out
of
its
own
assets
and
profits
for
the
actual
losses
that
it
wrongfully
caused
the
15
individual
respondents
herein
to
sustain
and
incur
from
september,
1961,
through
december,
1975,
by
continuously
breaching
and
violating
their
favored
nations
rights
under
the
'52
contract
and
by
uncooperatively
and
effectively
withholding
all
of
the
true,
relevant,
and
material
facts
concerning
that
breach
of
contract
from
respondents
from
1961
through
1975.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
statement
of
the
situation
concerning
the
payments
that
arkla
made
to
the
united
states
government
by
opposing
counsel
are
not
precisely
consistent
with
the
contracts
between
arkla
and
the
united
states
government.
an
examination
of
section
2(n)
of
the
1961
protective
lease
contract,
exhibit
p-45,
reflects
that
that
contract
anticipated
the
situation
that
actually
existed
between
arkla
and
the
government.
in
other
words,
arkla
was
in
a
dual
capacity.
it
was
not
the
typical
lessee.
it
was
a
lessee
that
was
also
a
pipeline
purchaser
that
owned
and
operated
a
pipeline
system
and
a
gas
processing
plant
in
the
sligo
field,
and
under
section
2(n)
of
that
government
lease
contract
arkla
was
obligated
contractually
to
purchase
the
government's
gas
at
reasonable
rates
and
reasonable
prices.
and
the
government
did
require
arkla
to
pay
the
prices
the
government
felt
was
reasonable
for
the
government's
royalty
gas
as
delivered
into
arkla's
sligo
pipeline
system.
as
evidenced
by
exhibit
p-82,
arkla
and
the
government
negotiated
as
to
the
price
that
arkla
would
have
to
pay
to
the
government
for
the
government's
royalty
gas
and
the
explicit
language
of
that
letter
contract,
exhibit
p-82,
sets
forth
so
many
cents
per
mcf
to
be
paid
by
arkla
for
the
government's
royalty
gas.
now,
with
respect
to
the
problem
that
these
respondents
had
in
discovering
and
obtaining
the
true
facts
concerning
arkla's
payments
of
higher
prices
to
the
united
states
government
for
the
government's
royalty
gas
produced
in
the
sligo
field
and
delivered
into
arkla's
sligo
pipeline
system
and
into
arkla's
sligo
gas
processing
plant,
i
think
we
must
begin
with
the
fact
that
at
the
time
it
became
necessary
for
arkla
to
arrive
at
a
price
that
it
would
pay
the
government,
one
of
their
officials,
mr.
j.
c.
templeton,
a
vice
president
who
was
in
charge
of
negotiating
price
on
behalf
of
arkla
with
the
government,
wrote
a
memorandum
on
november
17,
1961,
to
mr.
b.
e.
harrell,
the
senior
vice
president
who
actually
negotiated
our
'52
contract
on
behalf
of
arkla,
and
inquired
of
mr.
harrell,
what
price
should
we
pay
the
government?
mr.
harrell
came
back
with
a
memorandum
dated
november
20,
1961,
which
is
in
evidence
as
exhibit
p-58,
wherein
he
said,
"i
have
no
particular
opinion
as
to
what
price
arkla
should
pay
the
government
but
i
do
wish
to
point
out
that
we
have
a
favored
nations
contract
with
mr.
w.
e.
hall
et
al.
and
they
are
receiving
approximately
8-1/2
cents
at
this
time.
"
here
is
the
company
official
who
was
very
familiar
with
the
negotiations
that
led
to
the
perfection
of
the
'52
contract
and
he
said,
i
do
not
know
whether
payment
of
a
higher
price
to
the
government
would
breach,
activate,
or
trigger
this
favored
nations
clause.
but
if
it
does,
it
could
cost
arkla
millions
of
dollars
during
the
life
of
the
'52
contract.
so,
in
arkla's...
in
the
mind
of
their
chief
vice
president
who
negotiated
the
contract
with
respondents
in
'52,
there
was
a
serious
question
about
whether
the
payment
of
a
higher
price
to
the
government
would
activate
or
trigger
this
favored
nations
clause.
one
month
later,
on
december
27,
1961,
the
corporate
counsel,
mr.
robert
roberts,
jr.,
had
received
a
copy
of
mr.
harrell's
warning
memorandum,
wrote
the
company,
and
said,
in
connection
with
the
government
lease
contract...
and
this
memorandum
is
in
evidence
as
exhibit
p-62,
he
said,
it's
a
very
difficult
problem
in
connection
with
the
government
lease,
and
arkla
doesn't
want
to
buy
any
gas
or
set
a
price.
so,
with
that
background,
let's
look
at
what
happened
from
1961
forward.
as
testified
to
by
frank
hall,
he
and
his
now-deceased
father,
w.
e.
hall,
sr.,
went
to
arkla's
office
month
after
month,
year
after
year,
from
'61
to
'73,
to
seek
to
determine
if
arkla
was
paying
anybody
else
a
higher
price
in
the
sligo
field,
obviously
to
see
if
they
had
any
rights
under
their
favored
nations
clause.
each
time
mr.
harrell
and
mr.
miles,
primarily
on
behalf
of
arkla,
told
them
that
they
were
receiving
the
highest
prices
that
arkla
paid
to
anyone
else
in
the
sligo
field,
that
mr.
hall
was
a
royalty
owner,
he
was
an
overriding
royalty
interest
owner,
and
a
working
interest
owner,
and
he
didn't
delineate,
are
you
paying
a
higher
price
for
royalty
gas
or
are
you
paying
a
higher
price
for
working
interest
gas,
he
just
said,
are
you
paying
anyone
else
in
the
field
a
higher
price?
on
each
occasion,
they
were
told,
you're
getting
the
highest
price
that
we're
paying
to
anyone
else
in
the
field.
now,
these
people
relied
upon
this,
they
believed
it
in
good
faith,
and
they
had
no
way
to
check.
there
was
nothing
of
record
as
to
what
price
arkla
was
paying
the
government.
they
didn't
even
know
they
were
taking
any
of
the
government's
royalty
gas
into
their
pipeline
system,
or
into
their
sligo
plant.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
i
think...
yes,
sir,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
we
sued
for
breach
of
contract
because
they
destroyed
these
people's
contractual
rights
and
their
rights
to
enforce
and
implement
their
contractual
rights
consistent
with
all
applicable
laws,
rules,
and
regulations.
and--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
the
damages
should
be
measured
by
what
the
united
states
government
received,
your
honor.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
it's
award
of
damages
measured
by--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
well,
i
think
it
can
be
styled
that
way
semantically
but
i
would
say
from
the
legal
proposition
it
would
be
the
payment
of
damages
by
arkla--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir,
and
in
that
regard--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--your
honor,
i
think,
perhaps
in
this
context,
we
filed
a
petition
with
the
federal
power
commission
on
june
30,
1976.
we
asked
them
to
clarify
what
we
could
and
would
have
received
as
contractually
authorized
if
we
had
been
able
to
file,
if
we'd
have
had
the
true
facts
to
make
a
section
4(d)
notice
filing.
and
they
set
forth
rather
explicitly
and
expressly
that
if
we
were
contractually
authorized
to
receive
the
same
prices
that
the
government
received
from
arkla
for
its
gas
and
for
the
liquids
and
the
condensate,
that,
one,
if
it
was
a
severable
price
for
the
liquids
and
the
condensate
like
the
government
received,
there
would
have
been
no
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
liquids
and
the
condensate.
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
contract
law.
and
they
said,
with
respect
to
the
dry
residue
gas,
if
we
were
contractually
authorized
and
if
we'd
have
filed
for
the
same
price
that
the
government
received
for
the
dry
residue
gas,
these
are
the
maximum
area
rate
ceilings
up
to
which
we
would
have
approved.
and
they
said,
not
maybe,
or
possibly,
they
said,
we
would
have
approved
your
contractually
authorized
prices
up
to
these
area
rate
ceilings.
and
that
was
filed
in
evidence.
that's
exhibit
d-59,
your
honor.
it's
a
november
8,
1976,
order
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
the
commission
deferred
to
the
courts,
your
honor,
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
were
contractually
authorized.
in
other
words,
we
brought
the
suit
in
state
court,
and
part
of
our
proof
was
to
prove--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--your
honor,
i
interpret
it
that
way
and
i
think
the
louisiana
courts
did
too,
because
the
order
clearly
says,
if
you
would
have
filed
and
if
you
were
contractually
authorized,
these
are
the
rates--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir.
it's
exhibit
d-59.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
183.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir,
and
it
was
cited
by
the
louisiana
court
in
its
opinion
in
the
appendix
at
the
top
of
page
62,
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
specifically
relied
upon
the
federal
power
commission's
november
8,
1976,
order.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
no,
sir.
in
what
you
call
a
retroactive
rate
increase,
your
honor--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--your
honor,
they
defer
to
the
courts,
recognizing
that
the
courts
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
breach
of
contract--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
well,
at
the
time
we
found
out
about
it,
your
honors,
in
1974--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir,
that
is
the
problem.
that
is
the
problem.
and
it's
our
position
that
arkla's
breach
of
the
contract
and
withholding
of
the
facts
gave
rise
to
a
separate
and
independent
cause
of
action
under
state
law
for
recovery
of
damages
to
be
paid
by
arkla
and
the
stockholders
and
not
to
be
included
in
arkla's
rate
base
or
passed
on
to
consumers.
and
i
believe
this
court
in
1961,
as
i
read
the
pan
american
petroleum
v.
superior
court
of
delaware,
recognized
that
the
natural
gas
act,
which
effectuated
a
stream
of
regulation
based
on
private
contracts,
held
that
these
common
law
contract
rights
were
not
abrogated
or
destroyed
by
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
we
were
still
afforded
rights
to
be
treated
as
we
should
have
been
treated
and
that
is,
the
fact
should
have
been
disclosed.
these
parties
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
file
their
section
4(d)
notices
and
put
their
contractually
authorized
prices
into
effect.
mr.
justice
stevens
posed
the
question
as
to
what
would
have
happened
in
'61
if
we
would
have
known
about
this
information.
we
would
have
filed
a
section
4(d)
notice
with
the
commission.
if
there
was
any
dispute
at
that
time
about
whether
or
not
we
were
contractually
authorized,
the
chances
are,
i
submit,
based
on
the
commission's
long-time
policy
of
deferring
contractual
questions
to
the
courts,
they
would
have
deferred
us
to
the
courts
at
that
time.
we
would
have
gone
to
court
to
determine
if
we
were
contractually
authorized
a
higher
price,
the
court
would
have
decided
it,
and
then
prospectively
we
could
have
received
whatever
the
court
said
we
were
contractually
authorized
to,
consistent
with
the
commission's
area
rate
ceilings.
but
that
whole
process
was
prevented
from
occurring
because
they
withheld
the
facts
and
failed
to
comply
with
their
affirmative
duty
to
disclose
the
true
facts.
i
think
it's
adequately
been
discussed
in
other--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir,
they--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
just
a
breach
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
disclose
true
and
material
facts
relative
to
contractual
rights.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
after
the
louisiana
supreme
court
rendered
its
judgment
on
march
5,
1979,
they
issued
an
order
on
april
25,
1979,
and
they
said
that
we're
not
interested
in
the
damages
awarded
for
the
liquids
and
the
condensate,
based
on
what
the
government
received.
we
are
interested
in
the
damages
awarded
on
the
dry
residue
gas
by
the
louisiana
courts.
and
they
ordered
us
to
file
copies
of
our
complaints,
our
amended
complaint,
and
all
copies
of
all
the
damages
evidence,
and
summaries
of
how
the
courts
awarded
damages
for
the
dry
residue
gas,
the
difference
between
what
we
received
and
what
the
government
received
during
this
period
'61
to
'72.
and
we
filed
that
and
they
issued
an
order
on
may
18,
1979,
saying
that
our
damages
were
measured
by
what
the
government
received
and
what
the
government
received
was
fair
and
square
with
the
natural
gas
act,
below
the
area
rate
ceilings,
and
no
jurisdiction
over
the
condensate
and
the
liquids.
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
after
1972
when
the
small
producer
act
came
into
effect
and
these
people
were
given
small
producer
status,
that
is
simply
a
breach
of
contract
matter
in
which
you
recover
those
damages.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
did
not
have
to
make
a
filing.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
but
the
commission
has
held
that
we
were,
arkla
has
treated
us
as
such,
and
i
really
think
that's--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--that's
correct.
and
it's
our
position
from
'61
to
'72
it
made
no
difference
with
respect
to
the
condensate
and
the
liquids,
that
we
should
have
been
paid
the
same
as
the
government
got
because
because
the
commission
has
said,
if
there's
a
severable
price
paid
to
the
government,
which
there
was,
we
should
have
the
same--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--we've
been
caught
in
a
catch-22,
your
honor,
that
arkla,
by
withholding
the
facts.
and
in
the
order,
they
refer
to
the
note,
no.
5,
1980
order,
the
commission
said,
we
refuse
to
go
back
20
years
to
see
what
would
have
been
approved.
well,
in
their
november
8,
1976,
order,
they
said,
if
you
were
contractually
authorized,
we
would
have
approved
up
to
these
maximum
area
rate
ceilings.
we
defer
to
the
courts
to
find
out
if
you
were
contractually
authorized.
so
after
the
louisiana
supreme
court
had
rendered
its
judgment,
staff
counsel
issued
a
brief
saying,
in
order
for
us
to
get
the
damages
for
the
dry
residue
gas
from
'61
to
'72,
we
should
seek
a
waiver
of
the
section
4(d)
notice
filing
based
upon
arkla's
withholding
of
the
facts
in
the
prevention
of
performance
in
estoppel.
so,
we
filed
for
the
waiver
alleging
that
our
prices
were
below
area
rate
ceilings,
that
we
were
prevented
from
filing,
there
was
no
humanly
possible
way
that
we
could
make
the
filing.
and
the
commission
ruled
that
in
essence
we're
denying
the
waiver
because
it
goes
back
20
years.
and
that
goes
into
the
catch-22...
it
goes
back
20
years
because
they
effectively
withheld
the
fact
the
court
needs.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
no,
sir,
they
have
the
authority
to
grant
a
waiver
and
they
granted
it
in
20-some-odd
cases
that
we
cited
to
the
commission...
plaquemines,
piqua,
and
other
decisions...
they've
granted
waivers;
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
no,
sir,
we've
taken
an
appeal
from
their
denial
of
the
waiver
to
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
it's
pending
there.
the
ferc
in...
the
petitioner
herein
has
asked
that
court
to
hold
that
proceeding
in
abeyance
until
this
court
rules.
now,
where
we
are
procedurally,
if
you
think
it's
necessary
for
us
to
get
a
waiver--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
waiver
issue
is
essential
to
us
getting
damages
for
the
dry
residue
gas
from
'61
to
'72
and
this
court
doesn't
feel
that
it
can
address
the
waiver
head-on
in
this
breach
of
contract
case,
then
i
think
certainly
we're
entitled
to
go
through
the
process
to--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--yes,
sir,
and
entitled
to
finish
it.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
the
commission
said
that
it
just
goes
back
too
far,
it...
they
say
the
equities
are
on
our
side
in
the
original
order
that
they
issued.
they
supported
our
rates
and
said
they
were
below
area
rates.
they
took
that
out,
that
footnote
out
in
the
errata
notice,
but
simply,
they
say,
it
just
goes
back
too
far
and
we
don't
want
to
get
into
a
position
of
speculating
what
someone
else
might
have
interpreted
the
contract
back
in
1961.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
sir?
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir,
but
it's
being
applied
to
us
when
we
were
prevented
from
taking
the
action
necessary
to
implement
our
rights
at
that
time.
we're
saying
arkla
is
estopped
to
rely
on
its
own
breach
of
contract
and
its
own
withholding
of
the
facts
which
prevented
us
from
implementing
our
contractual
rights
consistent
with
the
section
4(d)
notice
filings
from
'61
to
'72
with
respect
to
the
dry
residue
gas.
and
that
that's
really
why
we've
been
damaged.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
it
was
taken--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--the
rehearing
was
denied,
i
believe,
january
2...
the
waiver
was
denied
on
november
5,
1980.
we
filed
application--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--no,
sir,
i
believe
you
granted
certiorari
january
19
of
this
year,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
we
filed
may
25,
1979.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
i
believe
it
was
january
7
or
8
of
this
year.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
the
other
side,
the
petitioner
herein,
made
a
filing
showing
that
our
application
for
rehearing
with
the
ferc
had
been
denied.
we
made
a
filing
to
inform
the
court
that
it
had
been
denied,
of
course,
but
that
we
had
taken
the
appeal
to
the
5th
circuit.
i
think
it
was
done
by
me,
so
the
letter
would
be,
a
copy
of
the
petition
for
appeal
attached.
i
believe
that
was
the
method
by
which
it
was
attached.
your
honor,
i
think
examination
of
what
happened
in
the
case
of
western
natural
v.
cities
service
gas
co.,
a
case
arising
through
the
oklahoma
state
courts,
this
court
having
denied
cert
and
dismissed
the
appeal,
and
then
the
adjunct
case
going
before
the
fpc
and
before
the
d.
c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
where
cities
service
gas
company
breached
and
violated
a
1949
private
gas
sales
contract...
ours
was
a
1952
contract.
they
withheld
their
cooperation,
that
is
cities
service
gas
co.
withheld
its
cooperation,
prevented
western
natural
from
getting
an
abandonment
under
section
7(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
they
prevented
western
natural
from
filing
a
new
contract
with
the
commission
as
a
new
rate
schedule
under
section
4
of
the
act,
and
they
prevented
western
natural
from
getting
higher
prices
for
its
gas
sold
in
interstate
commerce.
western
natural
went
to
court,
that
proved
that
cities
service
had
withheld
its
cooperation,
preventing
them
from
getting
commission
approval
to
abandon
and
to
file
a
new
contract
with
the
commission.
they
recovered
compensatory
damages
for
the
breach
of
contract
and
for
failure
to
cooperate
of
over
$5
million.
the
oklahoma
court
of
appeal
affirmed
that
judgment,
this
court
denied
the
cities
service's
appeal,
and
dismissed
its
petition
for
certiorari.
then
it
went
before
the
fpc
and
the
fpc
recognized
and
delineated
between
the
obligation
of
a
pipeline
company
to
pay
just
and
reasonable
area
rates
for
natural
gas
sold
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
obligation
of
a
pipeline
company
to
respond
to
compensatory
damages
out
of
its
own
pocket
for
losses
caused
by
the
breach
and
violation
of
private
contractual
agreement.
and
i
thnk
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
clearly
recognizes
that
there
must
be
some
measure
of
protection
for
people
who
sign
these
contracts,
because
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
the
natural
gas
act
did
not
destroy
the
integrity
of
private
supply
contracts,
but
if
this
court
holds
that
we're
caught
in
a
catch-22,
where
they
breach
the
contract,
withhold
the
facts,
prevent
us
from
making
a
notice
filing,
then
we
cannot
recover
damages,
then
in
truth,
in
fact,
the
integrity
of
this
contract
is
completely
destroyed.
fifteen
citizens
who
contracted
in
good
faith
with
arkla
have
been
wrongfully
injured
and
damaged,
and
i
just
think
the
result
is
so
inequitable,
especially
in
light
of
the
fundamental
priinciples
that
this
court
has
passed
down
case
after
case
starting
with
united
states
versus
peck
in
1880,
that
a
party
to
a
contract
that
prevents
the
performance
of
that
contract
may
not
rely
upon
its
own
breach
of
contract,
its
own
inequities,
its
own
fault,
to
escape
its
own
liability
for
the
losses
caused
by
that
breach
of
contract.
and
i
respectuflly
submit
under
the
rational
of
this
court's
deicions
in
naacp
versus
fdc
decided
by
this
court
in
1976
that
a
pipeline
company,
whether
it
breaches
civil
rights,
employment
rights,
rights
under
contracts,
or
commits
torts,
the
damages
that
it
must
pay
because
of
these
types
of
conduct,
or
these
types
of
injuries
must
be
absorbed
by
the
company
out
of
its
own
private
corporate
assets
and
profits
and
not
included
in
its
rate
base
or
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
because
breaching
contracts
or
injuring
someone
through
the
violation
of
their
civil
rights
or
their
employment
opportunities
is
not
a
legitimate
function
of
a
pipeline
company.
a
pipeline
company
is
supposed
to
honor
contracts.
it's
supposed
to
fulfill
contracts.
it's
supposed
to
honor
people's
civil
rights
as
well
as
their
private
rights.
and
if
the
court
is
worried
about
the
consumers
having
to
pay
any
of
these
damages
by
arkla
passing
it
through,
arkla
has
to
pursue
that
through
a
separate
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
receive
commission
approval.
if
the
commission
is
concerned
about
arkla
trying
to
pass
any
of
this
corporate
damage
obligation
on
to
the
public,
the
commission
can
simply
deny
the
attempt
to
pass
through
and
make
arkla,
the
wrongdoer
that
caused
these
losses
and
damages,
simply
stand
behind
its
obligation
to
make
these
people
whole.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
your
honor,
not
as
long
as
they
were
withholding
the
facts,
and
i
was
getting
to
that
a
while
ago.
mr.
frank
hall,
one
of
the
respondents,
was
having
lunch
at
the
freeport
petroleum
club
in
january,
1974,
when
he
inadvertently
overheard
a
conversation
between
two
gentlemen
assumed
to
be
employees
of
arkla
talking
about
the
prices
that
arkla
was
paying
the
government.
that's
the
first
time
any
of
these
respondents
had
any
idea
that
arkla
was
paying
a
higher
price
to
the
government
or
paying
any
price
to
the
government
at
all,
and
so,
if
laches
would
occur,
it
would
seem
like
january
of
'74
would
be
the
earliest
time
that
they
could
have
taken
any
action,
and
what
they
did
after
that
was,
they
wrote
letters
to
arkla
and
called
arkla
and
asked
them
to
give
them
the
facts.
and
arkla
continued
to
withhold
the
facts.
will
hall,
jr.,
wrote
letters
to
the
department
of
the
interior
and
asked
them
to
tell
him
what
prices
arkla
was
paying
the
government.
the
department
of
interior
took
the
position
that
that
was
privileged
proprietary
information,
what
the
department
of
interior
was
receiving
for
we,
the
people's
royalty
gas,
and
refused
to
give
them
the
information.
so
they
had
to
hire
me
in
may
of
1974
to
simply
obtain
the
facts.
they
didn't
have
the
facts
when
they
retained
me
in
1974,
and
pursuant
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
i
finally
received
the
information.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
immediately
before
the
noon
recess
i
was
addressing
some
questions
about
laches,
and
would
like
to
follow
that
through,
your
honors.
as
i
was
saying,
that
i
had
not
been
able
on
behalf
of
my
clients
to
obtain
the
true
facts
until
i
received
a
letter
from
the
united
states
department
of
interior
dated
june
24,
1974.
that's
in
evidence
as
exhibit
p-142,
where
the
department
of
interior
advised
me
on
behalf
of
these
respondents
as
to
the
actual
prices
that
the
government
had
been
receiving
from
arkla
for
its
royalty
gas
in
sligo
field.
at
that
time
i
made
a
written
demand
upon
arkla
for
a
full
disclosure
of
all
of
the
true
facts,
specifically,
copies
of
their
contracts
with
the
government
and
specifically
all
of
the
information
concerning
the
prices
that
arkla
had
been,
was
then
paying
to
the
united
states
government,
copies
of
checks,
and
other
sales
reports
and
production
reports.
and
that
amicable
plan
was
rejected.
in
essence
they
forced
us
to
file
a
lawsuit
to
judicially
discover
all
of
the
truth,
relevant
material,
and
necessary
facts
from
arkla's
own
files
and
records.
and
as
the
record
in
this
case
will
reflect,
we
went
through
about
two
years
of
litigation
which
were
devoted
solely
to
discovery.
we
had
to
file
motion
after
motion
and
obtain
order
after
order
in
order
to
obtain
all
of
the
true
facts
necessary
to
prove
the
breach
of
contract
and
to
prove
the
losses
and
damages.
and
the
issue
concerning
obtaining
a
waiver
of
the
notice
filing
requirement
only
came
up,
as
i
said,
in
1979,
when
the
ferc
staff
counsel
suggested
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
damages
for
the
dry
residue
gas
from
'61
to
'72,
that
we
should
think
of
obtaining
a
waiver
of
the
notice
filing
requirement,
which
we
very
promptly
filed
for
in
may
of
1979.
and
the
waiver
application
was
based
on
two
contentions,
one
in
light
of
the
western
natural
v.
cities
service
litigation
that
a
waiver
should
not
be
necessary
when
it's
a
breach
of
contract
that
prevented
you
from
making
the
filing
in
the
first
instance.
but
that
if
it
was,
we
were
entitled
to
it,
because
arkla,
by
breaching
the
contract
and
withholding
the
facts
from
respondents
for
14
years
and
then
requiring
respondents
to
go
through
six
years
of
litigation
to
discover
and
prove
the
true
facts,
certainly
the
20-year
period
that
had
elapsed
was
the
fault
of
arkla
and
not
the
fault
of
these
respondents.
and,
of
course,
after
the
waiver
was
denied
on
november
5,
1980,
we
immediately
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
with
the
commission
which
was
denied
on
january
2.
mr.
james
fleet
howell
yes,
sir.
the
two
leading
appellate
decisions
from
the
d.
c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
are
the
plaquemines
case,
decided
in
1971.
the
commission
had
declined
to
grant
a
waiver
of
a
section
4(d)
notice
filing
for
a
five-year
period
prior
to
'71,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
d.
c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
commission
to
grant
a
waiver
if
it
found
that
the
prices
provided
for
under
the
contract
were
below
area
rate
ceilings.
and
so
it
reversed
and
remanded
to
the
commission
to
grant
the
waiver.
in
the
piqua
case,
decided
by
the
commission
in
1978,
the
commission
granted
a
waiver
saying
that
the
commission
had
a
long
history
of
granting
waivers
where
through
some
inequity
there
was
the
noncompliance
with
the
procedural
notice
filing
requirement.
and
they
said,
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
contract
and
the
true
intentions
of
the
parties,
they
should
grant
a
waiver
to
clear
up
the
absence
of
the
prospective
notice
filing
requirement.
so
that--
mr.
james
fleet
howell
--i've
never
been
more
shocked
in
my
life,
your
honor,
to
be
quite
frank.
we
felt
that...
and
even
the
commission
recognized
that
the
louisiana
courts
had
held,
the
courts
to
whom
the
commission
had
deferred,
had
held
that
arkla
in
breach
of
its
contractual
obligations
failed
to
disclose
the
facts.
thank
you.
