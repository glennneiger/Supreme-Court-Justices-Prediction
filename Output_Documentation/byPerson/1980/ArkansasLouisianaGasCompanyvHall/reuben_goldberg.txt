mr.
reuben
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
suit
filed
by
the
respondents
in
the
state
court
of
louisiana
with
respect
to
a
contract
that
is
on
file
with
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
as
the
respondent's
rate
schedule
no.
4.
in
that
suit
they
sought
damages
which
were
in
fact
a
claim
for
a
retroactive
rate
increase
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
respondents
were
successful
in
that
suit
and
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
violated
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
violated
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
and
its
exclusive
rate
jurisdiction
and
commission
regulations.
and
i
should
say
to
the
court
that
these
positions
were
steadfastly
maintained
through
each
of
the
courts
through
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
trial
court
as
well
as
the
courts
of
appeal.
the
contract
between
petitioner
and
respondents
provides
for
the
sale
by
respondents
to
petitioner
at
the
wellhead
of
the
entire
stream
of
wet
gas
from
respondents'
wells
located
in
the
sligo
field
in
north
louisiana.
i
should
say
at
this
point
that
gas
is
known
as
wet
gas
when
the
gas
stream
contains
liquefiable
hydrocarbons.
these
liquefiable
hydrocarbons
exist
in
the
gas
stream
in
a
gaseous
state
and
they
are
extractable
through
a
simple
process
at
a
processing
plant
at
the
surface.
when
these
liquefiable
hydrocarbons
have
been
extracted,
the
gas
stream
is
known
as
dry
gas
or
residue
gas,
and
the
terms
are
used
interchangeably.
now,
to
return
to
the
contract
which
is
at
the
seat
of
this
case,
the
negotiations
leading
to
its
execution
were
quite
lengthy.
the
respondents
wanted
a
provision
included
in
the
contract
which
is
known
in
the
industry
as
a
favored
nation
provision.
they
wanted
one
that
would
escalate
fixed
prices
that
had
been
agreed
to
in
the
contract
if
any
buyer
of
gas
in
the
sligo
field
paid
any
seller
a
price
higher
than
the
fixed
prices
in
the
contract.
they
also
wanted
the
favored
nation
provision
to
apply
to
liquefiable
hydrocarbons
and
to
condensate,
which
is
a
form
of
crude
oil
that
at
the
surface
without
any
processing
drops
out;
it
becomes
a
liquid
and
drops
out
in
the
separator.
the
favored
nation
provision
that
finally
emerged
when
the
petitioner
rejected
these
proposals
of
respondent
is
the
one
that
appears
in
the
contract.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
99.
it
does
not
apply
to
hydrocarbons
and
condensate
and
is
triggered
only
by
the
purchase
of
gas
by
petitioner
in
the
sligo
field
from...
and
i
quote
these
words,
because
they
are
important...
"another
party
seller"
at
a
price
higher
than
the
fixed
prices
established
in
the
contract
for
the
wet
gas.
the
favored
nation
provision
provides
that
in
determining
whether
a
given
price
is
in
fact
a
higher
price,
the
provisions
of
the
contracts
being
compared
bearing
on
that
determination
such
as
point
of
delivery,
delivery
pressure,
are
to
be
compared
and
adjustments
made
for
the
differences
between
them.
only
when
the
differences
are
found
and
adjustments
are
made
for
them
can
it
be
known
whether
in
fact
the
favored
nation
was
triggered.
petitioner
also
agreed
to
a
proposal
that
had
been
made
by
respondents
for
the
elimination
from
the
contract
of
payments
for
extracted
liquids
in
return
for
an
increase
in
the
price
for
the
gas
of
1/4
of
a
cent.
the
favored
nation
provision
during
the
negotiations
received
so
much
attention
and
was
so
carefully
dealt
with
by
the
petitioner
that
it
actually
became
thereafter
the
model
for
petitioner's
favored
nation
provisions
in
contracts.
in
1954,
after
this
court
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case
had
declared
that
producers
of
natural
gas
selling
gas
in
interstate
commerce
were
subject
to
the
natural
gas
act,
the
respondents
filed
a
contract
and
secured
from
the
commission
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
make
the
sales
as
required
by
the
act.
and
as
i
have
said
before,
at
the
outset,
it's
the
respondents'
rate
schedule
no.
4
on
file
with
the
commission.
some
years
later,
in
1961,
the
petitioner
acquired
an
interest
in
a
united
states
government
mineral
lease
of
lands
in
the
sligo
field,
the
very
same
field.
petitioner,
having
acquired
that
interest,
thereby
became
obligated
to
make
royalty
payments
to
the
united
states
for
the
value
of
the
extracted
liquid
hydrocarbons
and
condensate
and
for
the
value
of
the
residue
or
dry
gas.
the
lands
involved
in
the
government
lease
had
been
withheld
for
a
time
by
the
government
from
production
and
development
but
it
developed
that
adjacent
landowners
were
draining
the
minerals
from
underneath
the
government
lands
and
the
government
opened
them
up
to
development
and
that
produced
the
government
lease.
and
it
is
interesting
that
the
hall
group...
i
refer
to
the
respondents
sometimes
as
the
hall
group...
had
land
adjacent
to
the
government
lease.
petitioner's
acquisition
of
the
interest
in
the
government
lease
was
not
concealed
from
anyone.
the
petitioner
had
no
reason
to
keep
the
matter
hidden;
it
did
not
keep
it
hidden;
and
it
could
not
have
been
kept
hidden
from
knowledgeable,
active
oil
and
gas
men
such
as
existed
in
the
hall
group.
additionally,
the
papers
assigning
the
interest
to
the
petitioner
and
the
approval
of
the
assignment
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
it
was
recorded
in
the
recorder's
office
of
bossier
parish,
and
actually,
in
the
1962
report
to
its
stockholders,
the
petitioner
discussed
in
that
report
its
interest
in
the
lease
and
its
activities
thereunder.
and
i
should
say
right
here
that
despite
the
charges
of
fraudulent
concealment
by
the
respondents
in
the
lower
courts,
the
trial
court
made
no
findings
on
the
point.
the
intermediate
court
of
appeal,
the
court
of
appeal
of
louisiana,
found
that
there
was
no
fraudulent
concealment
and
that
finding
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
the
fact
is
there
was
no
concealment
of
any
kind
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
lease,
fraudulent
or
otherwise.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i'm
not
sure
that
they
expressly
stated
that
claim
but
our
position
is--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--no,
their
claim
of
a
breach
of
contract
is
that
the
royalty
payments
made
under
the
government
lease
constituted
a
purchase
from
a
party
seller,
the
government,
of
gas,
and
that
therefore,
since
that's
the
language
of
the
favored
nation
provision,
and
they
claim
that
it
was
a
higher
price
than
the
fixed
prices
in
the
contract,
and
therefore,
they
said,
the
favored
nation
provision
was
triggered.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
no,
it's
our
position
that
settled
louisiana
law
as
well
as
federal
law
says
that
a
royalty
payment
is
not
a
purchase
of
gas.
the
reason
is
that
a--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
our
defense
to
the
contract
action--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--well,
we
also--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--we
also
say
that
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
favored
nation
provision
was
not
triggered
because
the
royalty
payments
did
not
constitute
a
purchase
and
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
in
error.
in
actual
fact,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
court
of
appeal
agreed
with
the
petitioner
that
under
settled
state
and
federal
jurisprudence
the
royalty
payments
did
not
constitute
a
purchase,
but
it
went
on,
nevertheless,
to
hold,
that
there
was
a
triggering
by
reason
of
the
royalty
payments,
we
say,
and
that
decision
ignored
the
commonly
understood
and
accepted
usage
of
the
phrase
"purchase"--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--what
we've
asked
you
to
do
here--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--whether
the
award
of
the
court
below
violated
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
violated
the
primary
jurisdiction
and
exclusive
rate
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
and
regulations
of
the
commission.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
don't
know
what
they
would
have
done
but
that's
what
they
should
have
done.
that's
what
they
should
have
done.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
and
even
if
they
didn't
know
it
and
found
out
for
the
first
time
in
'74...
let's
assume
that
for
the
sake
of
argument...
their
proper
course
of
action
was
to
go
to
the
commission.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
finally
did
go
to
the
commission
recently
asking
for
a
waiver
of
the
filing
requirements,
recognizing
that
they
were
in
jeopardy
without
that
waiver.
so
that
if
they
had
asked
for
the
waiver
at
that
time,
at
any
time
earlier
than
1974,
they
would
have
been
confronted
by
the
same
proposition,
that
the
commission
has
denied
on
the
merits
that
request
for
a
waiver
in
a
very
well
reasoned
order
which
is
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
but
i
think
we
started
out
on
the
proposition
as
to
whether
they
had
made
some
other
claim
and
i
don't
recall
that
they
made
any
other
claim
other
than
the
royalty
payments
constituted
the
purchase.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
in
1962
they
were
asking
for
an
increase
back
to
1961--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--yes,
i--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--we
would
have
had
the
same
considerations
that
the
commission
refers
to.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
don't
think
they
could
come
in
and--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--we
do
not.
we
do
not.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
well,
the
present
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
as
presently
constituted
has
said
in
their
order
that
they
hesitate
to
speculate
on
what
the
commission
would
have
done.
i
do,
too.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
i
suppose
that
possibility
could
exist.
the
possibility
could
exist
also
that
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
demonstrate
either
that
there
was
triggering
or
that
it
was
in
fact
a
higher
price.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
not
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner,
we
submit,
did
everything
that
was
required
of
it,
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
contract,
nothing--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--if
you
assume
that
we
had
a
duty,
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
we
would
be
responsible
for
the
delay
if
that
is
the
federal
jurisprudence,
because
this
contract
is
not
controlled
by
state
jurisdiction,
state
jurisprudence.
it
is
a
contract
on
file
as
a
rate
schedule.
as
a
rate
schedule
under
the
natural
gas
act
it
is
the
federal
jurisprudence
that
determines
how
that
contract
is
to
be
handled
and
interpreted,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
public
interest
requirements
of
the
natural
gas
act.
this
is
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
state
court's
decision.
the
state
court
referred
to
article
2040
of
the
louisiana
civil
code
and
determined
that
under
that
civil
code
provision
there
was
a
duty
upon...
that
being,
not
a
duty,
but
that
the
petitioner
had
prevented
the
respondents
from
complying
with
the
rate
change
filing
requirements
of
the
act,
and
that
therefore
they
should
be
deemed
as
having
fulfilled
those
requirements.
and
i
point
out
in
that
connection
that
the
court
also
recognized
when
it
said
that,
that
it
was
dealing
with
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
it
had
to
meet
the
next
requirement,
would
the
commission
have
allowed
it?
and
it
concluded,
yes,
the
commission
would
have
allowed
it,
and
the
commission
has
told
you
in...
told
the
court--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--i
think
that
we
could
have
demonstrated
to
the
commission--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--we
didn't
because
they
made
no
filing,
but
if
you're
asking
me
to
speculate--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--if
they
also
met
the
qualifications
of
the
favored...
the
commission
would
have
had
to
find
that
the
favored
nation
was
triggered
because
the
royalty
payments
constituted
a
purchase
from
any
party
seller.
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
the
commission
could
have
decided
that.
the
jurisprudence
was
against
that
decision
and
a
royalty
interest
has
no
gas
to
sell.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
that's
right,
because
the
allowance
by
the
court
below
violates
the
determinations
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
it
violates
the
commission's
ceiling
prices.
i
would
point
out
also
that
the
commission
in
that
order
of
november
5,
1980,
which
is
part
of,
attached
to
our
reply
brief
as
an
appendix,
that
the
commission
points
out
that
its
review
of
the
record
reveals
to
it,
and
it
concludes,
that
arkla
could
reasonably
have
assumed
that
the
royalty
payments
did
not
trigger
the
favored
nation
provision.
and
i
submit
that,
under
those
circumstances,
if
we
could
have
reasonably
assumed
that,
i
think
the
more
reasonable
inference
is
that
we
could
have
demonstrated
to
the
commission,
if
back
in
1962,
perhaps,
and
the
commission
would
not
in
1962
have
found
that
the
favored
nation
provisions
had
been
triggered.
the
file
doctrine
says,
the
filed
rate
doctrine
says
that
no
one
can
claim
a
rate
as
a
legal
right
that
is
other
than
the
filed
rate,
and
that
not
even
a
court
can
authorize
commerce
in
the
commodity
on
other
terms.
now,
the
courts
below
sought
to
avoid
the
filed
rate
doctrine
by
labeling
respondents'
claim
as
a
claim
for
damages.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes,
but
i'd
like
to
say
first,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
back
to
the
states.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
and
we
say,
also,
that
if
you
read
montana-dakota,
in
that
situation,
where
the
filed
rate
doctrine
was
held
to
apply,
the
complainant
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
under
the
thumb
of
a
parent
corporation,
was
clearly
prevented
from
going
before
the
commission
and
protesting
the
rates
involved.
nevertheless,
it
was
held
that
the
filed
rate
doctrine
precluded
them
from
having
a
claim.
and
we
say
that
that
is
no
less
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
no,
we
think
that
if
you
read
the
case
as
a
whole--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--they
sought
to
draw
a
right
to
their
cause
of
action
from
the
terms
of
the
federal
power
act
itself.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
but
a
reading
of
that
decision
clearly
demonstrates
that
even
if
they
had
gone
to
the
state
court
they
could
not
have
maintained
that
action,
and
that
they--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--i
think
the--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--i
think
the
language
of
the
court
in
that
case
clearly
says
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
federal
power
act
there
is
no
recourse
available
to
the
state
court
either.
if
they
had
any
recourse
it
would
have
been
only
to
the
commission.
if
the
respondents
here
had
any
recourse
it
was
only
to
the
commission
and
they
have
gone
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
has
pretty
well
indicated
in
that
order
of
november
5,
1980,
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
relief
that
they
claim.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
undertakes
to
assert
that
the
contract
is
to
be
interpreted
on
the
basis
of
state
law
and
that
it
derives
its
force
and
effect
from
state
law.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it
derives
its
force
and
effect,
particularly
with
respect
to
rate
matters,
from
the
natural
gas
act,
and
it
is
federal
jurisprudence
that
determines
how
that
contract
is
to
be
interpreted.
and
under
federal
jurisdiction...
i
refer
particularly
to
the
mobile
case...
there
is
no
purchase
of
gas
associated
with
the
payment
of
a
royalty.
when
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
held
that
the
commission
would
undoubtedly
have
allowed
the
rate
had
they
gone
to
the
commission
at
an
earlier
time,
we
think
the
court
was
induced
to
make
that
statement
by
a
statement
by
the
commission
in
an
earlier
order
it
had
issued
in
which
it
said
that
the
rates
did
not
exceed
the
ceiling
prices.
the
commission
has
since
that
time
advised
that
it
was
in
error
because
it
thought
the
sale
was
a
sale
at
the
plant
and
not
a
sale
at
the
wellhead.
as
a
sale
at
the
wellhead
it
clearly
exceeded
the
ceiling
prices
and
the
commission
says
very
clearly
it
was
a
violation
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction,
the
commission's
exclusive
rate
jurisdiction
extends
not
only
to
the
unit
rates
and
charges
and
to
all
classifications,
practices
and
regulations
affecting,
such
rates
and
charges,
but...
and
i
quote...
"to
all
contracts
which
in
any
manner
affect
or
relate
to
such
rates,
charges,
or
to
classification
of
the
services.
"
i'd
like
to
go
on
but
i
would
love
also
to
preserve
some
five
minutes,
and
i
notice
my
light
is
on.
thank
you.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
just
a
few
things
here.
counsel
referred
to
section
2(n)
of
the
government
lease
as
having
some
bearing
on
this
case.
it
has
absolutely
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
case.
the
government
had
no
gas
to
sell,
and
it
never
tendered
any
gas
to
arkla
which
arkla
would
have
had
to
purchase.
arkla
produced
its
own
gas
and
it
made
royalty
payments.
the
government
under
the
lease
had
the
option
to
take
gas
in
kind
instead
of
accepting
royalty
payments.
if
it
had
exercised
that
option,
it
would
have
had
gas
to
sell,
gas
it
would
have
sold.
and
in
order
to
have,
to
assure
itself
of
a
purchaser,
section
(n)
was
in
the
provisions,
but
if
it
did
not
exercise
that
option
section
(n)
was
entirely
irrelevant.
counsel
keeps
saying
that
they
purchased
residue
gas
and
the
commission
was
misled
at
one
time
too,
and
it
has
corrected
itself.
it
was
basing
its
opinion
that
there
was
no
breach
in
the
ceiling
prices,
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
thought
residue
gas
had
been
purchased.
and
if
the
court
will
refer
to
our
reply
brief
at
pages
11
and
12
you
will
find
the
commission's
statement
retracting
their
earlier
statement
and
explaining
why
they
had
been
misled.
now,
counsel
also
referred
to
a
legal
opinion
which
he
said
demonstrated
a
reference
to
the
difficulty
of
the
problem.
that
legal
opinion
had
nothing
to
do
with
triggering.
it
was
related,
triggering
of
the
favored
nation
clause.
it
was
related
to
balancing
takes
from
other
producers,
from
a
number
of
producers,
how
you
balance
takes.
there
was
a
legal
opinion
dealing
with
triggering.
when
the
government
demanded
rents
or
royalty
payments
in
excess
of
the
fixed
prices
in
the
contract,
arkla
was
concerned
about
agreeing
to
that
without
first
knowing
whether
it
would
trigger
favored
nation
provisions
and
it
submitted
the
question
to
its
counsel
and
its
counsel
said,
favored
nations
will
not
be
triggered
by
the
royal
payment.
a
royalty
payment
is
not
a
purchase
of
gas
under
well-settled
federal
and
state
jurisdiction.
now--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--page
11
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes;
yes.
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
11
and
the
top
of
page
12;
there's
a
two-paragraph
quotation.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
yes.
there
is
a
small
producer
issue
in
the
case.
we
discussed
it
in
our
brief,
but
i
just
simply
haven't
had
the
time
to
get
to
it.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
not
unless
they
can
demonstrate...
there
still
is
the
question,
even
if
you're
a
small
producer.
the
small
producer
exemption
says,
you
don't
have
to
make
a
filing
to
get
the
rate
increase
but
you
still
have
to
demonstrate,
you
still
have
to
show
that
the
increase
is
contractually
authorized
and
that
it
is
reasonable.
so
that--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--well,
that's
a
question
for
the
commission.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
because
it's
within
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction
and
in
its
exclusive--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--no,
i
don't
think
the
commission
said
that.
the
commission
did
say,
in
some
order,
that
there
were
five
of
the
respondents
that
had
small
producer
certificates
but
that
the
benefit
of
the
small
producer
exemption
was
available
to
all
of
the
respondents.
it
did
say
that.
and
that's...
that's
on
appeal--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--no,
i
don't
think
that
you
could
say
that,
because...
may
i
just--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--it's
on
appeal
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
reuben
goldberg
it's
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
what
i
did
want
to
indicate,
that
the
perception
of
the
case
and
the
development
of
its
attitude
towards
its
primary
jurisdiction
and
exclusive
rate
jurisdiction
is
very
interesting.
when
we
first--
mr.
reuben
goldberg
--thank
you.
