justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
the
respondents'
position
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
goldberg,
is
that
arkla
had
a
duty
under
the
contract
to
report
that
they
were
getting
a
higher
price
from
the
united
states
than
they
were
getting
from
the
respondents.
that's
their
position,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
the
complaint
here...
i
understood
from
the
briefs
that,
in
effect,
what
they're
saying
is,
you
breached
the
contract
by
not
formally
advising
them
you
were
getting
a
higher
price
from
the
united
states
than
you
were
getting
from
them,
and
that
this
is
a
breach
of
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
recall
it,
you
argue
in
the
briefs
that
purchase,
you
didn't
realize
that
the
contract
provision
came
within
purchase
until
that
was
decided
in
'78,
wasn't
it,
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
1978
did
not
the
louisiana
courts
construe
the
word
"purchase"
as
including
what
happened
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
didn't
know
about
it,
you
say,
until
1978?
but
wouldn't
that
be
a
defense
to
a
contract
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
you're
arguing
that
primary
jurisdiction,
they
have
no
jurisdiction
to
do
this
at
all.
but
if
it's
a
simple
contract
claim,
breach
of
contract
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
had
that
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
is
that
anything
we
can
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
federal
question
involved
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
the
respondents
had
known
that
the
favored
nation
clause
was
triggered,
if
you
had
told
them
so,
or
at
least
had
given
them
the
information
on
which
they
could
conclude
that,
i
take
it
between
'62
and
'72
they
might
have
gone
to
the
federal
commission
and
got
approval
of
the
rates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
they...
well,
they
didn't
know,
they
didn't
know;
you
didn't
tell
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose,
mr.
goldberg,
your
position
would
be
that
it
applied
even,
even
had
arkla
here
deliberately
and
intentionally
not
informed
the
respondents
that
they
were
getting
a
higher
rate
in
a
situation
where
they
should
have
given
it?
i
guess
you'd
still
say
that
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
nevertheless,
they
can't
prevail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
but
answer
my
question.
am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
how
far
you
would
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
howell,
what
would
be
the...
if
you're
right
and
we
were
to
affirm--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--what
damages
would
you
recover,
say,
for
the
period
from
'62
through
'72?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
difference
between
what
you're
getting
and
what
the
united
states
got?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
then
that's
really
in
effect
the
rate
increase,
isn't
it,
for
that
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
that's
the
name
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
effect
it's
the
same
thing
as
a
rate
increase.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
it
would
an
amount
of
money--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--without
prior
commission
approval
which
would
be
exactly
what
you
would
have
sought
in
the
way
of
approval
of
a
rate
increase
had
you
known
about
this
deal
with
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
that
have
some
significance
on
the
real
issue
we've
got
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
telling
me
then,
actually,
you
in
effect
had
commission
approval
on
the
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get,
mr.
howell,
did
the
commission
in
effect
tell
you,
if
you
can
get
approval
of
the...
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
contract
here
and
you
were
entitled
to
it,
consider
that
we've
approved
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
order
in
our
appendix?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--well,
was
the
position,
mr.
howell,
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
grant
a
waiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
judgment
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--is
it
pending
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
going
to
say,
if
you
lose
here,
is
the
issue
of
a
waiver
still
open
in
the
5th
circuit
or
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
already
there,
i
gather,
and--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that,
mr.
howell?
frankly,
i
ask
because
i
don't
remember
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
many
precedents,
mr.
howell,
waivers
by
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
were
surprised
when
you
got
the
denial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
were
about
to
say
that
that's
on
appeal
anyway,
weren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
well,
that's
where
it
presently
sits?
