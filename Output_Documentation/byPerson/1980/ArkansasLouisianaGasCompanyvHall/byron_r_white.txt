justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
if
you
had,
say,
in
1972
on
3,
you
had
gone
to
the
commission
and
asked
for
a
rate
increase,
saying
that
you
were
contractually
permitted
to
increase
the
rates
and
please
give
us
permission
to
charge
a
higher
rate,
and
the
commission
had
said
fine,
that's
fine,
now,
that
certainly
would
have
been
permission
for
you
prospectively
to
file,
to
charge
higher
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
commission
authorized
to
give
retroactive
effect
to
any
rate
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
question
that
my
brother
brennan
asked
you,
was,
do
you
interpret
the
commission's
response
to
what
you
did
file
as
saying,
we
consent
to
your
charging
higher
rates
from
1961
up
to...
i
don't
think
they
have
the
authority
to
make
rate
increases
retroactive.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
were
conceded
that
the
contract
permitted
you
to...
if
there
was
no
question
whatsoever
about
that,
the
commission
would...
the
most
the
commission
could
do
is
say,
prospectively,
you
may
charge
higher
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
the
commission,
the
commission
opposes
the
result
you
want
to
reach
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
the
ground
that
this
would
undercut
their
authority
despite
the
claim
of...
your
claim
based
on
the
equities,
and
despite
your
in
effect
claiming
estoppel--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
misrepresentation
or
whatever?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
commission...
that's
the
commission's
position,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
'72
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least,
any
producer
who
was
a
small
producer
entitled
to
be
exempt
from
filing?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
some
argument
about
whether
all
of
them
are
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
from
'72
on,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
commission
position
is,
though,
from
'61
to
'72,
as
to
the
dry
gas
residue,
you're
not
entitled
to
any--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
waiver
appeal
taken?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
after...
that
was
after
we
granted
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
year,
did
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
knew
that
the
waiver
had
been
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
argument
in
this
case
about...
or
i'll
put
it
the
other
way...
must
we
decide
whether
these
companies
are
small
companies
that
are
freed
from
the
filing
requirements
as
of
'72?
is
there
an
issue
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
mean,
if
someone
is
a
small
producer,
then
from
'72
on
there
is
no
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
it'd
all
go
back
to
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
commission
in
this
very
case
said
that
to
the
extent
these
companies
are
small
producers,
then
it's
up
to
the
state
court
after
'72?
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
the
commission
washed
its
hands
of
the
whole
matter
then,
with
respect
to
post-'72
rate
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
want
to
extend
your
time,
mr.
goldberg.
