justice
white
would
that
have
been
dispositive
in
itself
or
not?
justice
white
would
the
result
have
been
the
same
if
the
constitutional
claim
had
not
been
reached?
justice
white
so
the
right
to
treatment
is
constitutionally
based,
is
that
the
holding?
justice
white
well,
the
new
statutory
basis
was
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
though?
justice
white
at
the
request
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
well,
in
any
of
the
briefs,
at
that
stage,
was
there
any
claim
that
the
developmental
and
disabled
act
rested
on
any
power
other
than
the
spending
power?
was
there
any
claim
that
it
was
a
congressional
effort
to
enforce
either
the
eighth
amendment
or
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
due
process
clause?
justice
white
you
read
them
that
way
here,
though,
don't
you?
justice
white
you
read
the
briefs
here
to
make
that
claim,
don't
you?
justice
white
do
you
feel
compelled
to
respond
to
that
argument
here,
as
stated?
justice
white
to
that
very
argument
that
you
just
are
reciting.
justice
white
no,
that
it's
a...
that
this
statute
is
an
exercise
of
some
power
other
than
the
spending
power.
justice
white
is
your
argument
that
if
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
enforcing
the
act
that
the
court
of
appeals
construed
and
applied,
if
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
that
enforcement
had
done,
had
ordered
what
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
as
a
condition
for
federal
funding,
would
you
say
that
they
would
have
exceeded
their
powers
in
this
area?
justice
white
assume
that
they
wouldn't,
assume
that
if
the
administrative
agency,
if
it
had
ordered
that,
that
would
have
been
within
the
act.
then,
i
suppose
someplace
you've
got
to
have...
a
court
somewhere
has
got
to
tell
an
agency
or
has
got
to
tell
a
state
what
is...
to
settle
disputes
as
to
what
the
act--
justice
white
--you
would
have
ended
up
in
a
court
somewhere.
justice
white
but
you
say
an
agency
couldn't
have
done.
justice
white
i
suppose
your
argument
also
is
that
even
if
the
agency
could
have
done
it,
the
proper
way
of
enforcing
would
be
through
the
agency
rather
than
a
direct
suit
in
court
like
this?
justice
white
well,
mr.
klein,
you
say
this
is
just
a
conditional
program,
a
grants-on-condition.
but
are
the
conditions
directly
enforceable
in
your
view,
in
court,
without
action
by
the
agency?
justice
white
but
you
won
on
your
constitutional
argument
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
people
who
hadn't
been
institutionalized?
justice
white
and
are
you
defending
the
judgment
below
on
that
ground?
justice
white
so,
rosado
is
irrelevant
if
you're
right
on
the
section
5?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
what
is
the
usual
pattern
for
any
of
these
patients
at
pennhurst
having
been
put
there
in
the
first
place?
are
they
civil
proceedings
that
have
institutionalized
them?
justice
white
but
you
don't...
aside
from
your
claims
about
treatment
and
habilitation,
you
don't
suggest
that
the
institutionalization
of
any
of
these
patients
has
been
unconstitutional?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
you
say
about
half
of
them
have
been
sort
of
voluntary,
so-called
voluntary
institutionalization
occurs?
justice
white
and
the
other
half
is
that
they
were--
justice
white
--at
the
request
of?
justice
white
and
based
on
findings
that
they
are
of
danger
to
themselves
or
others?
justice
white
but
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption,
i
gather,
that
except
for
your
claims
about
habilitation
and
treatment,
these
people
have
been
properly
institutionalized?
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
require
pennhurst
to
be
closed
anyway.
justice
white
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
say,
close
down
pennhurst?
justice
white
well,
general,
was
there
ever
an
indication
by
the
secretary
that
the
state's
compliance
with
the
conditions
of
the
statute
was
unsatisfactory?
justice
white
well,
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
are
you
representing
the
agency
that
administers
this
program
or
not?
justice
white
whether
it
wants
you
to
or
not?
which
is
a
perfectly--
justice
white
--perfectly
recurring
situation.
justice
white
you're
just
doing
your
duty,
aren't
you?
justice
white
whether,
you
disagree
with
the
agency
or
not?
that's
characteristic.
justice
white
well,
i've
been
there.
justice
white
just
about;
yes.
then
you're
representing
the
congress
that
enacted
this
legislation?
justice
white
whether
or
not
the
congress
knows
you
are,
or
not.
justice
white
mr.
days,
could
i
ask,
is
there
any
evidence
whatsoever,
that
the
agency
administering
this
statute
had
a
view
about
the
reach
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
the
pennhurst
situation?
is
there
some
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
agency
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
white
i
take
it,
when
you
speak
about...
the
way
you
spoke
about
public
funds,
you
are
relying
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
enforcement
power?
yes,
you
are.
is
that
right?
justice
white
you're
just
not
speaking
to
the
spending
power,
as
general
days
is?
justice
white
not
to
reach
state
funds
except
as
tied
to
federal?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
when
was
6010
passed?
justice
white
mr.
klein,
i
was
about
to
ask
your
colleague
before
he
ceded
his
time
whether
he
agreed
that
the
money
was
available?
justice
white
the
claim
is
that
one
justification
for
the
injunction
is
that
the
money
is
there
and
the
state
just
refuses
to
spend
it
in
accordance
with
the
act.
justice
white
well,
did
the
court
find
the
money
was
available?
justice
white
is
there
a
short
answer
to
my
question?
i
guess
there
isn't,
really?
justice
white
you're
saying,
when
the
government
grant
comes,
it's
your
money,
and
then
the
only
way
to
enforce
it
is
to
enjoin
its
use,
except
in
compliance
with
the
act.
justice
white
mr.
klein,
could
i
just
ask
you...
i
should
have
asked
general
days.
what
is
the
authority
for
the
federal
government
to
intervene
in
this
case,
do
you
know?
is
it
provided
for
in
the
act?
justice
white
is
that
a
general
statute?
