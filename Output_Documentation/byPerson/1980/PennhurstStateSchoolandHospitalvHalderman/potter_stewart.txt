justice

but,
you've
indicated
that
the
district
court
relied
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
stewart
what
if
any
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
did
the
court
rely
on?
justice
stewart
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
stewart
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth.
justice
stewart
of
course,
we're
not
reviewing
that
judgment,
are
we?
justice
stewart
did
the
district
court
rely
at
all
upon
the
developmentally
disabled
assistance
and
bill
of
rights
act?
justice
stewart
did
the
district
court
rely
at
all
upon
that
statute?
justice
stewart
and
there
was
no
basis
in
the
district
court?
justice
stewart
general
warshaw,
where
is
the
text
of
6010
upon
which
the--
justice
stewart
--where,
if
you
know,
the
page?
justice
stewart
it
was
under
professor
hohfeld's
analysis,
whenever,
there's
a
right,
whenever
anybody
has
a
right,
somebody
else
has
a
duty.
justice
stewart
do
you
remember
that?
that's
a
little
old-fashioned
now.
that
was
very
much
in
style
when
i
was
in
law
school.
justice
stewart
no,
there's
a
freedom,
there's
a
freedom.
that's
precisely
what
the
court
has
not
found,
in
my
view,
that
there's
a
right.
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
it's
important,
sometimes,
to
be
a
little
bit
accurate
in
momentous
analysis.
justice
stewart
it's
freedom.
if
somebody
has
a
right,
somebody
else
has
a
duty.
at
least
that's
the
way
i
was
taught.
justice
stewart
is
it
the
expression
of
or
the
creation
of?
justice
stewart
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
the
creation
of
a
right,
a
statutory
creation,
a
congressional
creation
of
a
right--
justice
stewart
--not
manifested
before.
justice
stewart
correct.
justice
stewart
of
course,
even
if
you're
quite
wrong
and
even
if
congress
purported
to
create
rights
and
duties,
there's
a
question
of
its
power,
isn't
there?
justice
stewart
how
many
states
have
accepted
these
funds?
justice
stewart
one
recently,
i
think,
withdrew,
did
it
not?
justice
stewart
eliminated
what?
justice
stewart
where
are
they
enunciated
in
the
constitution?
i
think
that
was
my
brother
rehnquist's--
justice
stewart
mr.
ferleger,
assuming
the
statute
says
precisely
what
you
submit
it
says,
your
position
is,
i
gather,
that
congress
had
the
power
to
enact
this
statute
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
stewart
you
don't
rely
at
all
upon
the
spending
power
of
congress?
justice
stewart
not
from
spending
power?
justice
stewart
the
spending
power
generally
is,
it's
well
established,
that
congress
can
grant,
as
to
a
state...
a
state
helps,
say,
in
building
a
bridge,
so
long
as
the
bridge
meets
certain
specifications.
and
then
if
the
state
accepts
the
federal
help,
the
bridge
has
to
meet
those
specifications,
same
as
they
do
with
a
highway
or
a
welfare
program
or
whatever.
justice
stewart
i
know,
but
the
offer
is
not
nearly
so
explicit
here,
is
it?
you
will
at
least
concede
that?
that
the
offer
of
federal
aid
under
this
program
is
not
nearly
so
explicit
as
the
conditional
done
accepting
the
conditions?
justice
stewart
my
only
point
is
that
before
you
answer,
the
money
expended
by
the
federal
government
under
this
program
is
very
inadequate
to
meet
the
so-called
conditions
of
the
grant.
justice
stewart
so,
including
medicaid
and
all
the
rest?
justice
stewart
you
think
this
is
a
post-medicaid
imposition
of
a
condition
on
the
receipt
of
medicaid,
for
example?
justice
stewart
so
your
position
is
that
any
state
that
accepts
medicaid
is
bound
by
what
you
say,
6010
of
this
statute
requires?
justice
stewart
well,
there
are
all
sorts
of
affirmative
obligations
if
a
state
voluntarily
accepts
the
conditions
of
of
welfare,
of
a
highway
program,
or
or
building
a
bridge.
but
the
state
has
an
option
to
accept
the
federal
grant
under
those
conditions
or
not
to
accept
it
at
all.
justice
stewart
that's
established.
but
here
the
conditions
were
hardly
made
clear
when
medicaid
was
enacted,
for
example.
justice
stewart
after,
after
the
original
grant?
justice
stewart
can
congress
in
1960
say,
we
grant
you
x
million
dollars
on
these
conditions
and
the
state
accepts
the
money
on
those
conditions
and
complies
with
the
conditions,
and
then
in
1970
can
congress
come
along
and
impose
additional
conditions
upon
the
1960
grant?
that's
the
question
here,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
statute
and
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stewart
well,
then,
if...
and
then,
you
take
that
position,
you
also
take
that
position
that
6010
was
enacted
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
spending
power?
justice
stewart
even
if
there's
no
spending
under
the
statute?
justice
stewart
under
some
other,
auspices?
justice
stewart
don't
you
think
that
part
of
the
established
validity
of
the
conditional
spending
power
assumes
that
there
shall
be
a
knowing
acceptance
of
the
conditions
on
the
part
of
the
state,
rather
than
a
hidden,
the
acceptance
that
they
only
learn
about
afterwards.
justice
stewart
well,
don't
you
think
that
the
whole
validity
of
the
concept
depends
upon
that?
justice
stewart
the
spending
power
is
based
upon
the
proposition
that
a
state
is
free
to
accept
or
to
reject
the
offer
of
federal
funds,
conditioned
upon
meeting
certain
requirements.
and
doesn't
freedom
of
choice
imply
knowledge
of
what
the
conditions
are?
justice
stewart
well,
pennsylvania
seems
to
be
quite
surprised
in
this
lawsuit.
justice
stewart
well,
if
6010
was
enacted
exclusively
under
congress's
spending
power,
then
i
suppose
the
state
could
withdraw,
and
not
accept
any
federal
spending.
justice
stewart
if
on
the
other
hand
it
were
enacted
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
perhaps
a
state
couldn't
withdraw.
justice
stewart
they
cannot
quit.
well,
he
doesn't
need
to
take
a
position.
justice
stewart
oh,
no,
no.
but
they
can
make
you
a
grant
of
aid
for
a
highway
program
or
a
welfare
program
or
whatever,
based
upon
the
program's
meeting
certain
specifications,
and
you
have
to
spend
your
funds
to
meet
those
specifications
if
you
get
federal
aid.
justice
stewart
and
if
you
accept
this,
your
program
has
to
meet
these
specifications.
