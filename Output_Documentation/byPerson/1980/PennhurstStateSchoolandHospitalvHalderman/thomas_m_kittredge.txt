mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
counties
surrounding
pennhurst.
i
think
in
the
first
instance
it's
necessary
to
focus
on
the
express
language
of
section
6010(1),
which
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
below
in
the
3rd
circuit.
that
language
speaks
of
right,
it
doesn't
speak
of
duties
or
obligations
in
the
states.
yet
it
is
precisely
those
duties
and
obligations
which
the
court
below
has
in
fact
found,
not
only
in
the
states
but
in
their
political
subdivisions.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
having
first
posited
that
in
fact
section
6010(1)
creates
the
obligation
in
a
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
to
provide
community
living
arrangements
to
all
developmentally
disabled
persons,
except
for
those
rare
cases
that
judge
gibbons
in
the
court
below
mentioned.
and
then
look
at
the
legislative
history.
there
are
very
anomalous
things
that
immediately
appear.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
in
the
1975
conference
report.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
assisting
the
states
in
monitoring,
in
developing
plans,
in
coordinating
services.
nowhere
does
it
say
anything
with
respect
to
imposing
on
the
states
an
obligation
such
as
found
by
the
3rd
circuit.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
think
this
court
dealt
directly
with
that
question,
with
respect
to--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--i
think
this
court
has
found
that,
for
example,
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
abortions.
i
think
in
harris
v.
mcrae,
however,
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--what
would
be
the
right,
then,
that
was
found
by
the
3rd
circuit?
it
would
be
the
right
to
an
entitlement,
to
have
the
states
pay
for
something,
to
provide
a
service.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that's
a
very
different
thing
than
saying,
for
example,
that
someone
has
the
right
to
free
speech,
or
freedom
of
the
press.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
if
that
is
so,
and
if
that
was
the
intention
of
congress,
i
submit,
sir,
that
they
would
have
plainly
said
so.
and
i
don't
think
that
they
did
intend
that,
and
certainly
they
never
plainly
said
so.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
think
that
6010
is
an
expression
of
what
the
congress
regarded
as
a
statement
of
the
obvious,
that
the
mentally
retarded
do
have
a
right
to
receive
humane,
decent,
appropriate
treatment
and
services.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
don't
think
it's
any
of
those,
sir.
i
think
it
is
their
human
right
and
it
was
not
meant
by
the
congress
to
be
anything
more
than
expression
of
a
right
such
as
that
people
have
a
right
to
clean
air,
for
example.
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--pardon,
sir?
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
it
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--if,
in
fact,
congress
meant
to
create
a
right...
"create",
in
an
operative
sense--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--they
wouldn't
have
said,
as
they
did
in
the
1978
amendment,
that
they
were
describing.
the
1978
amendment
to
section
6010
says,
that
it's
"the
rights
described
in
this
chapter.
"
not
the
rights
created
in
this
chapter.
they
didn't
view
those
rights
as
operative
things
entitling
people,
all
of
the
developmentally
disabled
in
the
united
states,
to
receive
appropriate
services,
treatment,
and
habilitation.
they
were
expressing,
i
think,
a
hortatory
view
on
all
of
those,
the
federal
government
and
the
states,
who
are
responsible
in
our
society
to
provide
services
to
those
who
need
them.
granting
the
developmentally
disabled
assistance
and
bill
of
rights
act...
and
if
i
can,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
that
as
the
dd
act,
simply
because
the
other
is
so
long...
discrete
obligations
were
imposed
on
the
states.
in
fact,
the
congress
did
so
very
distinctly
and
explicitly.
and
mr.
warshaw
has
already
mentioned
section
6011,
where
the
individualized
habilitation
plan
requirement
was
imposed
on
the
states
for
those
persons
receiving
services
from
programs
funded
by
the
dd
act.
and
in
6012,
with
respect
to
the
creation
of
a
system
to
protect
and
advocate
the
rights
of
the
disabled.
in
1978,
when
it
was
amended--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--it
does
indeed;
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
that's
exactly
right,
quite;
i
do,
sir.
i
think
you
can
at
least
logically
make
some
kind
of
a
distinction
between
6010(3)
which
at
least
does
speak
in
terms
of
obligations,
and
6010(1)
and
(2),
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
section
6010(3)
creates
an
obligation
in
the
states
either,
other
than
those
obligations
which
are
already
in
the
states,
with
respect
to
medicaid
regulations,
for
example,
and
so
on.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
that's
correct.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--oh,
absolutely,
sir.
absolutely.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
discussion
of
the
constitutional
predicate
for
this
particular
section
as
it
was
construing
it
mentioned
both
the
spending
power
in
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment...
i
must
confess
it
is
not
clear,
at
least
to
me,
which
of
those
predicates
the
3rd
circuit
relied
on.
in
any
event,
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
rely
on
the
spending
power,
because
if
in
fact
the
spending
power
is
the
sole
predicate
for
that
enactment,
there
are
two
results.
first
of
all,
there's
no
showing
for
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
any
of
the
counties
are
recipients
of
dd
act
funds.
and
secondly,
even
if
you
assume
that
everybody
involved
in
this
litigation
was
in
fact
a
recipient
of
dd
act
funds,
the
result
of
the
finding,
a
reading
of
6010
such
as
in
the
court
below,
would
simply
result
in
every
state
disdaining
dd
act
monies
from
now
on.
they
would
walk
away
from
it.
they
would
look
at
the
enormous
obligations
created
by
what
the
3rd
circuit
has
declared,
they
would
look
at
the
de
minimis
funding
provided
under
the
dd
act,
and
i
mean
that
in
a
relative
sense,
and
they
would
simply
say,
no,
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
believe
that
all
50
have.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
believe,
in
saturday's
paper,
it
was
reported
that
the
state
of
virginia
has
told
the
federal
government
that
it
can
keep
its
dd
act
money.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
if
you
assume
that
the
constitutional
predicate
of
6010
as
found
by
the
court
below
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
enforcement
power
in
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
you
have
to
determine
what
it
is,
what
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
right
that
is
being
enforced?
now,
there
have
been
some
courts
in
this
country
who
have
found
a
right
to
treatment
to
arise
from
the
liberty
interest
implications,
placing
a
person
in
the
custody
of
the
state.
but
all
of
those
have
been
focused
on
institutionalized
persons.
no
court
of
which
i'm
aware,
at
least,
has
ever
found
a
generalized
right
to
treatment
in
all
persons
developmentally
disabled
or
mentally
retarded
persons,
in
the
united
states,
whether
they
are
in
institutions
or
not.
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
1978
amendment
it
is
expressly
declared
that
there
are
more
than
two
million
developmentally
disabled
persons
in
the
united
states.
approximately
150,000
of
those
are
in
public
institutions.
if
you
speak
in
terms
of
a
right
to
treatment
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
i
understand
the
rationale
of
that
right
to
treatment,
you
have
to
focus
on
those
who
are
in
public
institutions.
the
remainder,
the
vast
majority
of
the
two
million,
no
court
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
ever
found
to
have
a
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
treatment.
thus--
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
--i
don't
believe
it
has,
sir.
no;
and
i
think
it's
important
that
the
court
recognize
that
in
fact
the
holding
of
the
3rd
circuit
is
not
restricted
to
pennhurst.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
for
respondents
here
suggests
without
quite
saying
so
that
the
focus
of
this
case
is
the
people
at
pennhurst.
i
submit
that
that's
not
true,
that
if
you
look
at
the
holding
in
the
3rd
circuit,
that's
not
what
the
3rd
circuit
said.
moreover,
the
relief
granted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
directed
the
creation
of
community
living
arrangements,
not
merely
for
the
1,000
people
at
pennhurst,
but
for
the
2,300
people
on
the
pennhurst
waiting
list
who
have
never
been
in
pennhurst,
who
are
not
now
in
pennhurst,
who
are
not
subject
to
state
institutionalization,
and
whose
fourteenth
amendment
rights
certainly
have
never
been
implicated.
not
only
that,
the
3rd
circuit
in
the
person
of
judge
gibbons
specifically
said
that
its
holding
in
that
case
applied
to
future
applicants
for
services,
not
simply
those
currently
receiving
services.
it
is,
i
think,
therefore
quite
clear
that
judge
gibbons
was
finding
a
6010
right
to
treatment
for
all
developmentally
disabled
persons.
if
you
read
the
section
that
is
being
relied
upon,
it
says,
"persons
with
developmental
disabilities
have
a
right
to
appropriate
treatment.
"
etcetera.
it
does
not
say,
institutionalized
persons
with
developmental
disabilities
have
a
right.
the
district
court
in
south
dakota
on
september
26,
1980,
found
in
the
case
of
henkin
v.
south
dakota
that
the
state
of
south
dakota
under
the
dd
act
as
construed
by
the
3rd
circuit
in
halderman,
had
an
obligation
to
fund
the
placement
in
a
private
facility
of
a
24-year-old
retarded
citizen
of
south
dakota.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
don't
offhand.
if
in
fact,
in
1975
or
1978,
the
congress
had
meant
to
impose
this
kind
of
a
fiscal
burden
on
the
state,
to
provide
these
services
to
all
developmentally
disabled
persons,
i
submit
there
would
have
been
some
mention
of
it
in
the
legislative
history.
certainly
congress
is
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
fiscal
resources
available
to
the
states
and
the
counties
are
very
limited
in
nature.
there
would
have
been
some
discussion,
certainly,
at
least,
as
to
how
much
all
of
this
was
going
to
cost.
yet
there
is
no
such
discussion
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
believe
that
the
congress
could
reasonably
have
blinded
itself
to
the
effect
of
what
it
was
doing
in
a
fiscal
sense.
and
i
think,
if
you
read
the
statute
as
we
have
suggested
it
should
be
construed,
you
avoid
that
problem.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
believe
it's
cited
in
an
amicus
brief.
i
don't
have
a
citation
simply
because
i
got
it
from
lexus.
mr.
thomas
m.
kittredge
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
so,
sir.
