justice
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question
along
those
lines?
may
a
state
withdraw
entirely,
now,
from
any
federal
support
for
this
sort
of
program?
justice
jr.
what
is
your
answer
to
it?
justice
jr.
how
would
it
do
that?
justice
jr.
i've
understood
you
to
argue
that,
you're
talking
about
constitutional
rights,
if
they
are
constitutional
rights,
even
if
a
state
withdrew,
do
you
suggest
a
federal
court
would
be
obligated
to
construe
and
apply
those
rights?
justice
jr.
even
if
the
only
funding
came
from
a
state?
justice
jr.
even
if
the
only
funds
for
these
institutions
and
for
these
patients
came
from
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
rights
you
have
described
would
still
be
enforceable
by
a
federal
court?
justice
jr.
mr.
days,
before
you
proceed,
perhaps
you
can
help
me
on
this
question.
is
the
government's
only
interest
the
result
of
federal
funds
being
implicated?
i'm
talking
now
about
a
legal
interest?
justice
jr.
is
it
your
position
that
that's
entirely
on
the
statute
and
the
acceptance
by
the
government
of
federal
monies?
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
you're
not
making
any
constitutional
claim
at
all?
justice
jr.
general
day,
just
to
clarify
my
thinking,
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
act
would
not
have
any
applicability
whatever,
the
dd
act,
unless
federal
funds
were
being
provided
under
it?
justice
jr.
you're
saying,
if
medicaid
funds
are
flowing,
the
obligations
of
6010
would
apply?
justice
jr.
may
i
interrupt
long
enough
to
ask
you
a
question
about
how
you
think
6010(3)
would
actually
operate
under
these
circumstances?
let's
assume
it
would
take
$100
million
for
the
state
to
comply
with
the
obligations,
the
conditions,
the
requirements
of
6010(3).
and
let's
assume
further,
the
federal
government
was
willing
to
put
up
$1
million,
leaving
$99
million
to
be
put
up
by
the
state
legislature.
and
let's
assume
the
state
legislature
said,
we
don't
have
$99
million,
we
have...
say...
$79
million.
may
a
federal
court
issue
an
injunction
against
the
state
legislature
to
borrow
the
money
and
put
the
additional
funds
up?
justice
jr.
where
would
you
draw
the--
justice
jr.
--but
i'm
asking
what
is
a
hypothetical
question.
i
want
to
know
under
what
circumstances
may
a
federal
court
issue
an
injunction
against
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
to
provide
such
additional
state
funds
as
may
be
necessary
to
meet
these
standards?
justice
jr.
but
what
happens?
would
all
funds
be
cut
off
to
these
institutions
in
those
circumstances?
justice
jr.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
6010(3)
authorized
the
federal
courts
to
cut
off
those
federal
and
state
funds.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
