mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
many
members
of
the
court
have
addressed
questions
to
my
colleagues
about
the
extent
to
which
the
dd
act
and
the
rights
recognized
under
6010
flow
from
the
constitution,
particularly
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
section
5,
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
insofar
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned
the
spending
power
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
address
the
extent
to
which
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
might
justify
the
affording
of
the
rights
that
are
contained
in
6010.
congress
passed
the
dd
act
because
it
wanted
to
insure
that
federal
funds
were
not
used
to
maintain
developmentally
disabled
persons
in
custodial
institutions
under
conditions
that
produced
regression
and
brought
affirmative
harm
to
such
persons.
it
decided
upon
the
course
that
it
took
in
1975
based
upon
over
a
decade
of
efforts
to
encourage,
if
you
will,
the
states
and
recipients
of
federal
funds
to
move
toward
deinstitutionalization,
to
move
toward
community
habilitation
of
people
otherwise
institutionalized.
the
thrust
of
6010
can
be
understood,
we
submit,
only
by
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
looking
at
what
the
two
houses
of
congress
initially
attempted
to
achieve
and
how
the
compromise
that
produced
the
dd
act
came
about.
the
senate
in
1974
and
'75
was
concerned
with
the
extent
to
which
people
in
institutions
like
pennhurst
were
having
their
rights,
both
constitutional
and
civil
rights,
violated.
it
made
these
determinations
based
upon
court
decisions
such
as
judge
johnson's
decision
in
the
wyatt
series
of
cases,
decisions
with
respect
to
willowbrook,
and
other
institutions
around
the
country.
it
also
had
legislative
hearings
and
debates
that
focused
on
this
question
of
the
rights
of
people
in
institutions
and
how
they
could
be
protected.
the
senate
bill
ultimately
contained
the
section
called
title
ii,
and
it
was
entitled,
the
bill
of
rights.
it
contained
detailed
specifications
with
respect
to
standards
for
the
provision
of
care,
not
only
to
the
institutionalized,
but
to
people
in
community-based
services
for
the
developmentally
disabled
as
well.
this
section,
title
ii,
called
400
pages.
the
house
version,
in
contrast,
was
very
consistent
with
what
congress
had
done
in
the
past,
since
1963,
in
response
to
a
message
from
president
john
kennedy
that
there
was
a
need
to
move
away
from
institutionalization
of
mentally
retarded
people
to
community
treatment
in
which,
essentially,
what
the
government
did
was
provide
funds
to
the
states
that
they
were
willing
to
accept
certain
conditions.
it
was
clear
that
if
those
conditions
were
not
met,
then
the
funds
would
be
cut
off.
so
this
focus
was
on
how
to
provide
additional
funds
and
how
to
insure
that
those
funds
provided
under
the
dd
act
would
be
adequately
utilized.
but
i
think
the
legislative
history
reflects
the
fact
that
both
houses
were
concerned
about
conditions
in
institutions
where
individuals
were
subjected
to
inhumane
conditions
and
nonhabilitative
situations.
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
dd
act,
one
need
only
substitute
the
name
iq
points
instead
of
gaining
iq
points
by
being
institutionalized,
and
where
they
are--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--this
record,
mr.
chief
justice,
speaks
very
strongly
to
the
point
that
however
pennsylvania
officials
have
tried
to
fix
up
pennhurst,
the
conditions
recur.
there
have
been
efforts
since
1950
to
paint
up
and
fix
up
pennhurst,
but
as
the
experts
and
other
observers
who
testified
in
this
case
revealed,
there
is
something
about
that
isolated
congregate
facility
that
tends
to
produce
the
conditions
that
time
and
time
again
were
found
by
people
who
visited
pennhurst.
it
was
not
something
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
there
is
evidence
in
this
record,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
people
in
pennhurst
were
not
cared
for,
were
not
attended
to,
produced
the
type
of
regression
that
they
experienced.
there
were
children
who
went
into
pennhurst
who
were
able
to
say
a
few
words
before
they
went
there
and
when
their
parents
came
to
visit
them
a
couple
of
weeks
or
a
couple
of
months
later,
they
could
not
speak.
there
were
children
who
could
walk
who
were
left
in
positions
on
the
floor
such
that
their
limbs
atrophied.
that
was
caused
by
pennhurst.
those
people
were
able
to
function,
they
were
able
to
do
very
rudimentary
reasoning
steps
that
no
longer
were
available
to
them
after
they
were
in
pennhurst
for
awhile,
and
of
course
the
physical
harm
that
people
suffered
was
clearly
the
result
of
the
institution...
bitings,
attacks
by
inmates,
by
persons
in
the
institution
upon
other
persons,
by
staff
upon
the
residents,
these
were
things
that
were
produced
by
the
institutionalization,
not
a
natural
consequence
of
the
lack
of
development
of
those
persons
in
pennhurst.
the
record
reflects
that
had
they
stayed
at
home
they
probably
would
have
been
in
better
position
now
than
they
have
been
after,
as
the
record
shows,
an
average
of
21
years
in
an
institution.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that
the
experts
have
testified
uniformly
that
it
does
not
come
from
the
abandonment,
it
comes
from
conditions
in
the
institution.
and
if
i
may
emphasize,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
not
here
urging
this
court,
or
in
fact
the
lower
courts,
to
make
policy
determinations,
to
make
technical
medical
determinations.
what
we
argue
before
the
court
is
that
congress
made
these
determinations
after
over
a
decade
of
considering
these
problems.
after
some
four
years
of
hearings
about
conditions
in
these
institutions,
it
had
reached
the
judgment
that
something
more
than
providing
funds
had
to
be
done
by
the
congress,
there
had
to
be
an
affirmative
effort
to
protect
the
rights
of
people
who
were
found
in
institutions
like
pennhurst.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
habilitation
plan
submitted
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it's
my
understanding
that
while
there
was
paper
compliance
with
some
of
these
requirements,
there
was
not
the
indication
that
in
all
respects
habilitation
plans
had
been
provided.
and
of
course,
in
pennsylvania,
contrary
to
what
mr.
kittredge
said,
the
record
reflects
that
the
counties
received
$600,000
in
i
believe
'75
or
'76
under
the
dd
act.
many
of
the
funds
did
not
go
to,
or
in
fact,
none
of
the
funds
went
to
institutions
like
pennhurst.
they
went
to
services
to
people
who
were
outside
institutions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
not
that
i'm
aware,
your
honor.
there
was
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
agency
that's
responsible
for
administering
this
program
has
never
raised
any
questions
about
what
was
going
on
there.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
is
true,
but
i
think
one
has
to
view
that
in
the
context
of
the
particular
action
of
the
united
states
in
this
case.
after
all,
the
united
states
came
into
this
litigation
to
represent
five--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--we
are
representing
the
united
states
and
to
the
extent
that
we're
representing
the
united
states,
we
represent
the
agency
that's
involved
in
the
transferring
of
funds.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
with
all
due
respect--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
right.
the
attorney
general--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
we've
always
understood--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--mr.
justice
white,
we
have
always--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--am
i
preaching
to
the
choir
in
this
regard,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right,
because,
we
think
that
the
congress
did
what
it
was
supposed
to
do.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
about--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
have
a
distinct
impression
that
the
congress
does
know
that
i'm
here,
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
to
rebut
something
that
was
said
by
mr.
warshaw.
we
did
get
into
this
case
before
the
dd
act
existed,
and
that
was
known
to
hew,
it
was
known
to
the
secretary.
and
secondly,
it
is
not
true
that
the
agency
has
continued
to
provide
medicaid
funds
to
pennhurst
unmindful
of
the
terrible
conditions
in
that
institution.
as
i
think
the
briefs
reflect,
only
16
of
the
40
units
at
pennhurst
have
been
certified
under
medicaid,
and
what
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
wants
to
do
is
spend
$4
million
to
try
to
fix
up
the
institution
so
it
can
qualify
for
medicaid
funds.
so
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
only
thing
that's
been
happening
insofar
as
the
government
was
concerned
was
this
lawsuit
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--excuse
me?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no.
my
remark
was
simply
to
indicate
that
contrary
to
mr.
warshaw's
suggestion,
it
is
not
just
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
that
has
expressed
a
concern
about
the
conditions
in
pennhurst.
the
secretary
of
hew
and
now
hhs
has
taken
action
to
try
to
improve
specific
conditions
in
that
institution.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
we
intervened
in
the
case
before
the
statutory
issues
were
presented.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right,
we
did
not.
what
we
did
was
simply
argue,
as
did
the
original
plaintiffs,
that
there
were
violations
of
the
constitution
reflected
in
the
conditions
in
the
institution.
and
after
all,
at
that
time,
as
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
has
pointed
out,
there
was
no
request
for
deinstitutionalization.
it
was
simply
a
request
to
include
a
condition.
but
we
took
the
position
before
the
district
court
and
in
fact
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
enough
in
this
record
to
establish
a
violation
of
constitutional
principles.
but
as
i
think
all
of
us
have
recognized,
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
those
issues
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
has
relied
upon
the
statute,
the
statute
reflects
congressional
policy
with
respect
to
people
in
institutions,
and
the
decision
ought
to
turn
on
that
particular
statutory
construction.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
court
believes
that
the
dd
act
does
not
provide
an
adequate
basis
for
the
relief
below,
we
think
that
a
remand
is
appropriate,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
address
the
constitutional
questions.
getting
back
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
act--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
let
me
explain
our
intervention,
mr.
justice
powell.
we
intervened
expressing
the
various
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
interest
of
the
united
states
was
in
the
fact
that
substantial
amounts
of
federal
funds
were
going
to
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
under
circumstances
that
appeared
to
produce
harm
for
the
people
in
the
institution.
so
that
was
our
reason
for
becoming
involved;
we
did
not
go
into
the
case
merely
because
we
were
theoretically
interested
in
constitutional
questions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
try
to
accomplish
that
on
a
daily
basis.
it's
not
always
possible
and
in
any
event,
as
this
court
well
knows,
congress
has
acknowledged
how
difficult
it
is
for
an
agency
to
cut
off
funds
to
people
who
are
in
need
of
assistance.
in
many
instances
the
preferable
approach
would
be
to
go
to
court
to
try
to
establish
the
rights
and
get
specific
performance,
if
you
will,
as
opposed
to
going
through
a
process
that
would
cut
off
the
funds.
in
any
event,
under
this
particular
legislative
arrangement,
even
if
the
funds
had
been
cut
off
under
the
dd
act,
medicaid
funds
and
other
funds
would
continue
to
flow.
what
we
think
the
dd
act
represents
is
a
compromise
between
the
senate
and
house
versions.
the
senate
wanted
to
cut
off
all
federal
funds
if
there
were
not
compliance
with
the
400
pages
of
detailed
standards.
the
house
did
not
want
to
do
that.
the
compromise
is,
cut
off
funds
that
flow
to
the
recipient
under
the
dd
act.
if
there
are
other
funds
flowing,
it
does
not
indicate
that
the
secretary
can
cut
off
those
funds,
but
it
does
provide
the
predicate
for
a
person
who
believes
that
he
or
she
is
being
harmed
by
a
particular
situation
to
go
into
court
and
get
relief.
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
compromise.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
would
take...
absolutely.
it
became
clearer
and
clearer,
mr.
justice
marshall,
particularly
after
the
court
of
appeals
asked
for
a
specific
briefing,
that
the
dd
act
was
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
not
exactly
correct,
mr.
justice
powell.
there
are
two
parts
of
this.
if
funds
go
to
the
commonwealth
under
the
dd
act
and
the
commonwealth
rejects
the
dd
act
funds,
then
that
takes
out
of
the
picture
the
administrative
process,
that
is,
the
requirement
of
planning,
the
review
of
the
plan
by
the
secretary,
imposition
of
the
plan,
and
then
some
review
by
the
secretary
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
compliance.
if
there
is
noncompliance,
the
funds
are
cut
off.
and
that's
what
happens
if
funds
are
flowing
under
the
dd
act,
or
if
they
cease
to
flow.
but
that
does
not
affect
the
right
of
a
person
under
6010
to
get
relief
if
non-dd
federal
funds
are
flowing
to
the
recipient
state.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
absolutely
our
position,
mr.
justice
powell.
there
has
been
a
suggestion--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor;
we
are
not
here--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--even
if
there
were
no
spending
under
this
statute,
as
long
as
there
was
spending
under
other
federal
programs.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
the
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
and
for
the
counties
and
for
the
parents-staff
association
argue
that
these
rights
contained
in
6010
are
prefatory.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth,
if
one
looks
at
the
record.
the
senate
was
really
trying
to
establish
rights
that
would
be
recognized
in
the
handling
of
federal
funds.
it
has
said
so
in
many
instances;
it
said
so
in
the
introductory
provision,
general
findings;
then
it
got
to
specific
findings
of
the
rights.
at
the
end
of
6010
there
is
a
comparison
between
the
rights
that
are
created
under
6010
and
other
constitutional
and
similar
rights.
there
is
the
application
of
6010
to
the
state
plan
provision.
the
congress
has
time
and
time
again
in
the
statute
indicated
that
it's
talking
more
about
wish
fulfillment.
in
fact
that
is
the
history
of
congress's
original
attempts
in
this
regard,
since
1963,
trying
to
encourage,
trying
to
prod.
and
what
the
legislative
history
reflected
was
that
it
was
not
working.
in
fact,
senator
javits
referred
to
the
fact,
not
only
that
states
weren't
doing
a
sufficient
job,
and
that
the
congressional
will
was
not
being
satisfied
in
these
programs,
he
pointed
to
insensitivity
on
the
part
of
federal
agencies
with
respect
to
this,
that
the
agencies
were
not
doing
enough
to
recognize
these
rights.
so,
that
this
is
far
from
a
prefatory
standard
of
congress.
we
believe--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--there
is
certainly
nothing
definitive.
i
think
counsel
for
the
other
side
is
correct
in
indicating
that
the
agency
has
spent
its
time
encouraging
through
its
regulations
and
dealing
more
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
as
presumptions
against
institutionalization,
and
the
need
to
move
people
out
of
these
institutions
as
quickly
as
possible.
mr.

my
response,
once
again,
goes
back
to
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
on
several
occasions
referred
to
the
need
to
use
dd
funds
to
leverage
the
use
of
other
federal
and
state
monies
to
provide
assistance
to
the
developmentally
disabled.
so
congress
was
really
thinking
in
terms
of
the
entire
pot
of
federal
money
going
to
assist
developmentally
disabled
people.
and
i
think
there
are
references
in
the
briefs
of,
the
brief
of
parc
and
of
halderman,
to
the
fact
that
there
are
some
$3
billion
being
spent
by
the
federal
government
to
assist
states
in
meeting
the
needs
of
the
developmentally
disabled.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
certainly
it's
preferable
for
congress--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
don't
think
that
the
whole
validity
depends
upon
that.
i
think
that
the
states
were
not--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
what
congress
has
said
in
6010
is
not
that
the
states
are
going
to
have
their
other
federal
funds
terminated
under
the
dd
act;
that's
perhaps
another
lawsuit.
what
congress
said
was,
insofar
as
those
funds
are
flowing
to
the
state,
then
individuals
who
are
in
those
institutions
may
have
a
right
to
bring
suit
against
you,
recipient
of
those
other
federal
funds.
so,
in
terms
of
the
administrative
process,
i
don't
think
there's
any
surprise
associated
with
the
dd
act.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
perhaps
i
should
say,
no
reasonable
surprise
associated
with
that
arrangement,
particularly
during
this
long
relationship
between
the
congress
and
the
states
in
terms
of
effort
to
assist
the
developmentally
disabled.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
came
out
of
the
congress
like
a
phoenix
from
the
ashes.
it's
part
of
a
continuum
of
relationship
between
states
that
have
received
billions
of
dollars
over
the
years
from
the
federal
government.
so,
for
one,
i
don't
think
that
the
congress
has
in
any
way
abused
or
violated
its
spending
power.
it's
done
what
it
felt
was
appropriate,
given
the
lack
of
movement
in
this
regard
over
such
a
long
period
of
time.
thank
you
very
much.
