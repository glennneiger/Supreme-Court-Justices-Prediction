mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
that
the
issue
is
the
rights
and
the
concomitant
duties,
and
i
think
the
question
here
is
legally
enforceable
rights
as
distinguished
from
the
variety
of
vague
ways
in
which
the
term
is
used.
i
think
it
helps
in
understanding
the
analysis
to
take
a
precise
look
at
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
to
the
legally
enforceable
rights
under
this
statute.
first
of
all,
it
found
that
for
each
person
at
pennhurst
as
well
as
on
the
waiting
list,
you
have
to
have
an
individual
determination
by
a
court
or
master
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
an
institution
as
compared
to
a
community
facility.
this
has
to
be
court
or
master-determined.
secondly,
in
that
determination
there
is
a
legal
presumption
in
favor
of
community
placement.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
way
this
works
in
pennsylvania
is,
the
court
has
established
a
master's
office.
this
is
not
a
master.
this
is
an
office
of
more
than
ten
people
that
is
now
operating
the
system
in
pennsylvania.
to
date
it
has
cost
approximately
$2
million
to
fund
that
office,
and
its
budget
is
$60,000
per
month
in
the
future.
this
office
reviews
all
the
actions
at
pennhurst
itself--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--from
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
the
district
court
ordered
the
state
to
pay
those
monies
and
the
state
is
currently
paying
them,
sir.
this
office
has
an
office
at
pennhurst
and
it
reviews
all
the
actions
out
there.
in
addition,
it
has
devised
a
systemic
community
placement
program.
it
also
works
with
the
parent,
a
member
of
the
treatment
team
at
pennhurst,
a
friend-advocate
also
authorized
by
the
court,
as
well
as
others,
to
devise
community
services
for
each
individual.
they
actually
get
a
place
in
position
in
the
community.
when
that
is
done,
if
there
is
no
objection,
with
the
masters'
approval
a
person
is
put
in
the
community
facility.
if
there
is
objection,
there
is
yet
a
second
master
who
has
been
appointed,
called
the
hearing
master.
then
you
go
before
the
hearing
master
and
you
have
to
prove
if
you
object
to
the
community
placement,
that
this
community
placement
would
be
worse
than
pennhurst.
at
the
hearing
master's
hearing
you
have
a
variety
of
due
process
rights,
including
the
right
to
subpoena
people.
the
hearing
master
has
paid
attorneys'
fees
to
people
appearing
before
him,
also
charged
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
some
of
these
hearings
have
gone
on
for
several
days.
now
this
is
the
duty
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
the
statute,
and
we
suggest,
every
state
has
institutions
with
people
housed
in
them
now,
so
what
the
court
was
finding
is
a
massive,
nothing
short
of
a
massive
federal
takeover
of
the
state
systems.
i
would
suggest
that
that
was
not
only
not
contemplated
by
congress
but
indeed
would
raise
the
gravest
of
constitutional
issues,
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
second.
now,
the
court
found
this
mandate,
this
broad
mandate,
in
the
two
findings
of
right.
and
again,
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
this
process.
congress
often
describes
findings
and
then
goes
on
to
implement
them.
and
here
it
makes
broad
statements
of
rights,
clearly
not
legally
enforceable
rights,
but
it
went
on
to
implement
them
in
the
statute
in
a
way
different,
perhaps,
from
that
which
the
respondents
would
urge,
and
in
a
certain
way
more
modest,
but
in
our
view
much
more
sensible.
first,
as
to
the
issue
of
deinstitutionalization,
that
is,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
congress
wanted
these
individual
determinations
and
virtually
everyone
in
the
community.
congress
in
1975
had
two
very
specific
requirements.
first,
it
asked
the
states
as
part
of
their
plan
to
devise
a
plan
to
eliminate
inappropriate
institutionalization
and
also
to
improve
conditions
for
those
for
whom
institutionalization
was
necessary.
at
that
point
congress
said,
the
states
have
an
obligation
under
this
act,
a
concrete
legal
obligation
to
devote
at
least
ten
percent
in
1976
of
their
monies
for
deinstitutionalization
under
the
act;
that
is,
ten
percent
of
the
federal
grant,
and
in
later
years
they
have
to
devote
30
percent
of
the
federal
grant.
and
congress
realized
that
deinstitutionalization
was
costly
and
the
legislative
history
says,
in
fact,
we
therefore
appropriate
additional
funds
so
that
the
states
will
have
the
monies
from
their
ten
percent
and
in
later
years
30
percent.
now
that
is
an
important
and
by
no
means
insignificant
step
which,
nevertheless,
is
not
the
one
the
court
of
appeals
found.
however,
the
legislative
history
goes
further,
because
in
1978
congress
amended
the
act...
this
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
'79.
it
did
two
very
significant
things
for
present
purposes.
one,
it
eliminated
the
mandate
for
a
plan
for
deinstitutionalization.
they
had
had
three
years,
the
institutionalization
had
taken
place;
again,
at
a
rate,
perhaps,
different
than
the
respondents
would
prefer.
but
it
had
taken
place.
second
of
all,
they
eliminated
the
earmark
provision.
rather,
they
said,
now--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
earmarking
funds
for
deinstitutionalization.
they
said,
rather,
you've
got
four
priority
areas
under
the
dd
act,
and
you
can
put
your
money
in
any
one
of
these,
sixty-five
percent
of
the
federal
grant.
and
the
four
areas
were
case
management
services,
child
development
services,
community
living
services,
or
non-vocational
social
development
services.
without
going
into
the
details
of
what
those
are,
it's
clear
that
the
states
in
'78
forward
could
continue
to
target
dd
monies
for
deinstitutionalization.
it's
also
clear
that
they
could
move
in
entirely
different
areas,
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
has
moved
them
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction.
congress
made
it
clear
that
all
the
monies
under
the
dd
act
could
be
used
for
institutional
improvements,
and
the
quote
from
the
legislative
history
is
"increasing
the
capacity
of
institutions
and
agencies
to
provide
or
coordinate
services
or
to
train
personnel.
"
so
it's
very
clear
that
congress
spoke
on
the
issues
that
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
extrapolate
upon,
only
it
spoke
in
a
way
that
declares
very
different
policy
than
others
might
have.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think,
your
honor,
congress
could
describe
conditions
as
a
condition
of
funding,
so
long
as
those
conditions
in
themselves
were
not
unconstitutional.
i
have
no
question
that
so
long...
that
is,
congress,
i
assume,
like
the
rest
of
us,
could
say,
if
you
want
federal
funds,
you
have
to
meet
certain
conditions.
now,
the
remedy
there
is
the
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised.
from
rosado
forward,
this
court
has
made
the
clear
the
remedy
is
to
give
the
choice
to
the
states.
and
i
don't
want
to
look
at
it
as
a
fund
cut-off,
because
that
puts
the
moving
hand
on
the
federal
government.
rather,
the
remedy
is
to
the
state.
either
you
comply
with
the
conditions
or
you
withdraw
from
our
program.
now,
rosado...
justice
harlan
made
this
very
clear...
in
rosado
you're
dealing
with
welfare
payments,
where
the
federal
government
is
involved
for
a
lot
of
money,
unlike
the
dd
act.
and,
second
of
all,
in
rosado
it
was
a
discrete
dollar
amount.
here
you're
talking
about
a
massive
takeover
of
the
state
system,
the
right
to
treat--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--mr.
justice
white,
if
the
conditions
are
as
i
describe
them,
they're
not
directly
enforceable
in
court.
of
course,
the
welfare
conditions
in
rosado
are
enforceable,
but
the
remedy
is
different.
if
the
conditions
are
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
said
they
were,
then
i
think
under
thiboutot
you
can
enforce
those.
however,
we
don't
think
those
conditions,
we
don't
think
this
statute
confers
entitlements,
and
i'm
making
an
alternative
argument
that,
if
it
did,
contrary
to
our
opinion,
that
nevertheless
the
relief
should
have
been
as
designed
in
rosado.
now,
going
on
in
terms
of
what
those
conditions
were,
if
you
look
at
the
conference
report,
the
legislative
history
in
'75,
congress
made
clear
that
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
sections
that
follow
it...
you
see
there
were
three
titles
to
the
bill;
title
ii
came
out
of
the
senate
bill,
and
it
was
a
bill
that
had
elaborate
standards
for
all
facilities.
the
house
had
no
such
provision.
they
compromised
and
the
compromise
came
out
with
a
three-section
title
ii:
section
6010,
which
was
these
findings;
6011
on
the
individual
habilitation
plans;
and
6012
on
creating
a
protection
and
advocacy
service.
and
congress
specifically
said
in
the
conference
report,
6010...
and
this
is
the
language...
"specifies
rights,
requires
habilitation
plans,
and
requires
protection
in
advocacy.
"
so
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
understood
the
difference
between
a
declaration
or
description
and
the
imposing
of
a
legal
right
or
a
legal
duty.
moreover,
in
the
report,
it
talks
about
the
discrete
standards
of
6010(3),
as
your
honor,
justice
stevens,
asked
about,
and
it
says,
as
to
those:
"in
themselves
we
realize
they
will
not
insure
quality
treatment
or
habilitation.
"
"therefore,
we
have
no
intention
to
displace
or
supplant
other
higher
standards
either
required
by
the
medicaid
statutes
or
other
state
statutes.
"
so,
again,
throughout,
congress
saw
the
limited
purpose
that
was
involved
here.
now,
i
think
the
final,
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
the
inappropriateness
of
what
went
on
below,
congress
right
in
the
opening
sections
of
the
statutes
specifically
eschews
any
desire
to
take
over
the
operation
of
a
state
plan.
it
makes
that
clear,
that
there
should
be
no
federal
takeover.
what
we
have
here
is
a
massive
federal
takeover.
one
last
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
you
have
raised
the
constitutional
issue
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
and
i
think
that's
an
issue
that
comes
up
in
part
because
in
order
to
make
this
a
mandate
that's
enforceable
other
than
for
the
option
of
fund
cutoffs,
it
would
have
to
be
pursuant
to
fourteen
and
five,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
somehow
thought
it
didn't
have
to
reach
that
issue.
of
course,
this
court
needn't
reach
that
issue,
or
the
constitutional
issue,
if
it
agrees
with
our
reading
of
the
statute.
i
would
only
say
that
the
law,
it
seems
to
me
is
clear,
and
we
would
certainly
welcome
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
rather
than
a
remand.
we
could
not
bring
it
to
this
court
because
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
opinion
on
a
narrow
statutory
ground;
respondents
chose
not
to
seek
the
constitution
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
require
the
states
to
devise
an
alternative
system
of
care
and
to
invoke
any
such
requirement
as
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
in
1970,
in
state
v.
sanchez,
this
court
dismissed
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question
that
issue.
no
federal
district
court...
and
the
court
is
aware
that
federal
district
courts
have
been
active
in
this
area...
no
federal
district
court
has
ever
upheld
a
right
to
create
alternative
facilities
for
the
mentally
ill
or
the
mentally
retarded
in
a
disputed
case.
it
has
never
happened,
and
as
i
say,
this
court
has
summarily
rejected
it.
so
i
think
this
court,
if
it
deems
it
appropriate,
has
to
reach
an
issue,
can
go
right
ahead
to
each
issue,
and
we
welcome
resolution
of
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it's
possible
for
the
court--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--maybe.
i'd
better
let
him
answer
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
takes
me
back
to
what
i
think
the
starting
point
is,
and
i
think
it
was
not
fully
addressed.
i
am
reminded
of
professor
cox's
statement
when
one
talks
about
the
right
to
appropriate
treatment.
i
was
thinking,
as
i
listened
to
the
argument
today,
that
right,
once
loosed,
is
not
easily
cabined.
and
of
course
the
respondent
would
fill
it
up
in
a
way
that
suits
their
view
of
the
state
of
the
art,
or
the
current
knowledge.
i
think
congress
was
much
more
specific
in
how
it
did
it.
two
critical
points:
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
act
is
there
empower
of
federal
court
to
make
individualized
determinations
and
nowhere
does
it
require
a
legal
presumption
of
deinstitutionalization.
to
the
extent
that
pennhurst
is
deficient...
and
every
institution,
of
course,
will
have
deficiencies;
i
think
we
live
in
the
real
world...
pennhurst
should
be
improved.
but
i
think
a
very
telling
point
has
been
omitted
by
my
colleagues.
they
have
a
philosophy.
i
represent
the
parents,
virtually
all
the
parents
and
the
guardians
of
people
at
the
facilities
who
are
strongly
opposed
to
deinstitutionalization
for
the
very
severely
and
profoundly
retarded
people.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
there
are
some
parents
who
are
not
members
of
the
organization,
your
honor;
yes,
that's
correct.
the
organization
has
most
of
the
parents.
one
small
point:
the
named
plaintiff
in
the
case
withdrew
from
this
case
precisely
because
she
opposed
the
philosophy.
but
the
key
point
is
that
these
parents,
despite
the
shortcomings
of
pennhurst...
and
lord
knows,
they'd
like
to
see
them
improved...
they
want
to
have
their
children
remain
there,
their
adult
children
even.
and
these
people
are
being
put
through,
under
this
statute,
lengthy
hearings
to
defend
their
philosophy.
i
suggest
there
is
no
way
that
congress
has
the
power
to
force
them
to
do
that.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
issue...
no,
that
issue
was
raised.
in
fact,
the
court
declined
to
grant
certiorari
on
the
issue.
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
were
split
at
the
time
over
the
standing
of
the
united
states
to
participate...
united
states
v.
solomon,
united
states
v.
mattson...
had
rejected
it.
the
3rd
circuit
upheld
it
as
a
general
enforcement
provision.
to
some
degree,
on
a
going
forward
basis,
your
honor,
the
issue
is
moot
because
congress
has
passed
a
statute
authorizing
the
united
states
in
the
future
to
participate.
and
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court's
finding.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
a
general
statute.
it's
called
something
like,
1980,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
