mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction
at
each
point
dispositive
of
the
issues
here.
the
congress
having
studied
over
12
years,
from
1963,
and
then
intensively
over
four
legislative
years,
1972
to
1975,
came
to
certain
conclusions
about
the
situation
of
severely
retarded
people,
about
their
human
possibilities,
about
the
necessary
conditions
for
realizing
those
possibilities,
and
about
the
persistent
destruction
large
isolated
institutions
impose
upon
retarded
people.
6010
is
both
a
deinstitutionalization
statute
and
an
anti-dumping
statute.
what
is
required
in
the
statutory
language
are
residential
programs
designed
to
maximize
developmental
potential
and
in
the
least
restrictive
setting.
the
states
must
move
severely
retarded
people
out
of
large
isolated
institutions
and,
more,
they
must
provide
structured
habilitative
residential
programs
in
their
stead.
the
congress
did
not
leave
the
states
naked
in
the
face
of
this
duty.
the
congress,
as
my
colleagues
have
adverted,
was
aware,
and
indeed
legislated
with
particular
awareness
that
there
were
massive
amounts
of
federal
funds
being
spent
upon
residential
facilities
and
for
retardation
services,
and
they
legislated
to
redirect
those
funds
as
well
as
the
state
funds
being
so
spent
to
community
care.
mr.
justice
powell,
justice
stewart,
the
congress
used
the
phrase,
6010.
and
whenever
the
congress
has
used
that
phrase,
rather
than
"federal
financial
assistance",
it
has
done
so
advisedly
to
reach
both
the
full
run
of
relevant
federal
funding
strings,
and
state
and
local
funds
as
well.
it
comes,
justice
white,
perhaps
more
easily
to
my
lips
than
to
general
days',
to
point
out
that
the
congress
was
moved
in
significant
part
to
act
in
section
6010
because
of
its
impatience
with
the
federal
executive's
actions
with
respect
to
these
institutions.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
indeed
they
do,
justice
rehnquist
and
6010
in
the
four
years
immediately
before
its
development
came
significantly
from
what
the
congress
had
learned
in
the
course
of
exercising
that
budgetary
oversight.
senator
javits
in
introducing
the
bill,
and
his
statement
pervades
the
legislative
history,
said
it
was
intended
to
end,
to
change
and
to
end
the
insensitive
federal
financial
support
for
facilities
which
provide
inhumane
treatment
to
retarded
people.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
your
honor,
the
spending
power
is
perfectly
adequate
to
reach--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
and
in
harris
v.
mcrae,
this
court
pointed
out
that
not
only
are
state
funds
which
match
federal
funds
reached,
but
the
congress
has
on
occasion,
in
title
xix,
for
example,
and
here,
i
suggest,
also
reached
to
state
funds
which
are
not
matching
funds
but
which
are
invoked
for,
similar
purposes
to
those
that
the
federal-state
funds
would
be
invoked
for.
in
january,
1975,
at
argument
here,
a
justice
of
the
court
raised
the
single
question
asked
in
o'connor
v.
donaldson
about
retardation,
and
made
an
observation
that
i
think
vividly
showed
what
it
was
that
congress
did
nine
months
later
in
section
6010.
the
observation...
and
i
quote...
was,
"states
have
said,
we're
going
to
institutionalize
these
people
in
order
to
give
them
the
best
custodial
care
we
can,
that
is,
decent
and
civilized
care,
but
they're
untreatable,
and
we're
just
going
to
keep
them
in
an
institution
indefinitely.
"
i
continue
with
the
observation:
"presumptively,
these
people
in
the
then
state
of
the
art
were
not
curable.
"
"retardation
was
a
permanent
condition
and
one
of
indefinite
duration,
and
the
ideal
was
to
provide
decent
custodial
care
to
relieve
the
families
of
the
economic,
social,
and
psychological
damage
which
might
follow
from
the
presence
of
the
retarded
person
in
that
household.
"
i
close
the
quotation
with
the
observation:
the
state
of
the
art
has
changed;
the
congress
has
so
found,
and
legislated
in
6010,
as
well
as
in
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children
act
and
in
several
other--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--pardon
me,
justice--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--1975,
justice
rehnquist.
it
was
signed--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--in
january,
1975.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
no,
sir;
oh,
no,
sir.
for
many
long
decades,
as
the
congress
found,
the
technology
had
been
such
that
retarded
people,
severely
retarded
people
in
particular,
were
known
to
have
the
capability
to
learn
and
grow
and
develop
in
the
presence
of
the
proper
education
and
training
technology.
it
was
not
a
new
fact;
it
was
quite
an
old
one.
the
congress
found
that
fact
as
a
predicate
for
acting
in
6010,
as
in
the
related
statutes
of
the
early
1970s.
the
situation,
therefore,
as
the
congressional
judgment
again
indicates,
is
that
the
choice
is
no
longer
warehousing
on
the
one
hand,
of
severely
retarded
people,
or
on
the
other,
imposing
damage
upon
families.
there
is
a
third
choice,
which
affirms
the
humanity
and
citizenship
of
retarded
people,
and
it
is
the
choice
which
the
congress
required
the
states
to
make
in
section
6010,
namely:
to
provide
habilitating
residential
programs.
the
congress
prohibited
custodial
care,
and
required
developmental
services.
that
is
plainly
the
case
on
the
face
of
6010,
and
the
senate
report
accompanying
the
bill
of
rights
said,
expressly,
custodial
care,
which
is
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
certain
individuals
are
essentially
incapable
and
"must
be
rejected".
now,
with
this
prohibition
of
custodial
care,
of
warehousing,
and
the
requirement
of
habilitation,
large
isolated
institutions
lost
any
reason
they
might
have
had
for
being,
let
alone
the
invidious
reasons
which
prompted
their
original
creation
some
seven
decades
ago.
at
their
very
best,
large
isolated
state
institutions
for
the
retarded
had
been
custodial.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
your
honor,
mr.
justice
blackmun's
concurring
opinion
in
usery
may
have
spoken
to
the
question.
of
course,
there
is
a
point,
both
in
terms
of
the
magnitude
of
the
federal
funds
made
available
under
the
spending
power,
and
in
terms
of
the
relationship
between
the
purpose
the
congress
undertakes,
and
the
purposes
for
which
those
funds
were
appropriated
in
the
first
place,
which,
if
not
present,
would
void
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
case
does
not
raise
that
question
for
two
reasons,
both
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
and
in
the
record
of
this
case.
first,
your
honor,
as
the
court
below
found,
the
cost
of
providing,
habilitating
small-scale,
family-scale
residential
programs
in
the
community
to
the
people
at
pennhurst
is
less
than
the
cost
of
the
destructive
care
at
pennhurst.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
your
honor,
under
no
circumstances,
it
would
be
my
view,
could
a
federal
court
to
issue
an
injunction
against
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
one
remedial
alternative
for
the
district
court
would
be
to
enjoin
the
use
of
federal
funds,
which
are
well
in
excess
of
$150
million
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
no,
your
honor,
on
the
contrary.
and,
forgive
me,
but
the
question
you
are
raising,
i
take
it,
goes
to
whether,
as
petitioners
assert,
without
really
a
very
clear
basis
in
rosado
itself,
that
the
district
court
is
limited
from
issuing
affirmative
relief
to
perform
the
purpose,
to
overcome
the
evil
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
overcome,
or
is
limited
to
an
injunction
to
cut
off
funds.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
district
court
would,
could,
or
should
issue
an
order
cutting
off
federal
or
state
funds.
rather,
your
honor,
as
the
series
of
cases
under
the
social
security
act
following
rosado
that
were
often
before
this
court,
townsend
and
swank
and
the
rest,
i
think
show,
the
federal
district
courts
do
properly
enjoin
the
performance
of
the
required
behavior.
of
course,
it
is
open
to
the
state
at
any
point
to
come
forward
and
say,
we
quit,
not
just
the
dd
act
program,
but
title
19
and
title
20,
and
then,
that
of
course...
if
there
is
any
question
at
all,
it
is
that
very
difficult
constitutional
question
left
open
in
the
prince
edward
county
case.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
that
such
would
violate
the
right
declared
in
section
1,
in
terms
quite
like
the
civil
rights
act,
1982,
where
title
i
of
the
civil
rights
act--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
are
faced
with
neither
horn
of
the
dilemma
in
this
case,
and
the
court
is
not
required
to
reach
that
question.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
exactly,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--yes,
your
honor,
i
take
that
position
as
a
matter
of
reading
the
statute.
that
question,
i
think,
is
not
raised
by
this
case.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
i
did.
and
i
thought
justice
stewart
and
i
were
both
pursuing
it
in
the
question
he
and
you
raised
that
the
statute
is
based
also
in
the
section
5
power
as
well
as
the
spending
power.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
however--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--exactly,
your
honor.
and
assuming
that
this
is
a
proper
exercise
of
congress's
plenary
powers,
the
answer
must
be,
yes.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
how
does
the
court
enforce
it?
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
well,
your
honor,
ultimately;
of
course.
the
federal
courts--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--your
honor,
in
that
eventuality
i
think
a
court
would
be
hardpressed
to
find...
to
invent...
to
create
benefit.
the
federal
courts'
remedial
powers
are
broad,
flexible,
and
most
deep,
and
in
the
circumstances
which
this
case,
like
most
civil
rights
or
social
security
act
cases
present,
the
problem
of
no
funds,
the
problem
of
a
complete
inability
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
discharge
the
statutory
duty
is
not
present,
as
it
is
not
present
here,
and
the
congress
knew
and
expected
it
would
not,
for,
the
congress,
dating
back
several
decades,
has
been
providing
rich
federal
funding
streams
for
retardation
services.
the
states'
own
spending
for
retardation
services
dates
back
to
the
first
decades
of
this
century.
the
commitments,
political
and
otherwise,
on
the
part
of
the
political
branches
of
the
government,
make
it
unlikely
that
circumstance
would
arise.
in
any
event,
with
respect
to
this
case,
the
provision
of
habilitative
residential
services
is
well
within
the
range
of
the
very
pennhurst
budget
itself,
were
that
budget,
as
we
suggest
6010
requires,
redirected
to
the
provision
of
habilitative
residential
arrangements.
thank
you.
