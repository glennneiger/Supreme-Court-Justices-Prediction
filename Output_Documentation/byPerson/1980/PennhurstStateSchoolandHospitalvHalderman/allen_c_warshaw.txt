mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
action
was
commenced
in
may
of
1974
by
a
resident
at
pennhurst
state
school
and
hospital.
by
her
original
complaint
that
plaintiff
sought
damages
and
sought
improved
conditions
at
pennhurst.
pennhurst
is
one
of
ten
state-owned
and
operated
institutions
for
the
retarded
in
pennsylvania.
it
is
located
approximately
30
miles
from
philadelphia
in
a
rural
setting
and
facilities
range
from
modern
modular
buildings
to
old
renovated
hospital-type
buildings.
at
the
time
of
trial
it
had
a
population
of
approximately
1,230
patients.
that
was
down
from
4,000
in
the
mid-'60s
to
1,900
in
the
early
'70s,
to
1,200
in
1977.
at
the
same
time
it's
staff
was
approximately
1,500.
of
its
population,
approximately
75
percent
of
that
population
was
severely
or
profoundly
retarded.
that
means
an
iq
of
below
36,
as
compared
to
the
general
population
of
the
retarded
where
only
five
percent
fit
into
that
classification.
that
is
a
number
which
increased
drastically
as
the
population
of
pennhurst
decreased
and
deinstitutionalization
occurred.
while
by
the
original
complaint
plaintiffs
sought
only
damages
and
improved
conditions
at
pennhurst,
subsequently
there
were
two
additional
parties
who
joined
by
intervention.
one
of
those
parties,
the
pennsylvania
association
for
retarded
citizens,
added
statutory
claims,
added
additional
parties...
namely,
the
counties
surrounding
pennhurst...
and
in
addition
changed
the
request
for
relief
to
one
requesting
the
closing
of
pennhurst,
and
an
order
requiring
the
counties
and
the
state
to
create
and
fund
community
placements
for
all
residents
at
pennhurst
and
all
those
awaiting
placement
at
pennhurst.
at
approximately
the
same
time
the
second
intervenor
was,
of
course,
the
united
states,
which
mirrored
the
constitutional
claims
of
the
original
plaintiff.
at
about
the
same
time
the
district
court
certified
a
class
which
consisted
of
those
at
pennhurst
and
those
on
the
waiting
list
at
pennhurst,
approximately
2,000
persons,
and
in
addition
anyone
who
might
in
the
future
be
admitted
to
pennhurst.
in
december
of
1977
after
trial
in
the
spring
of
1977,
the
district
court
issued
its
opinion
and
finding,
finding
that
pennhurst
did
violate
the
constitutional
and
one
statutory
right
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
statutory
right
was
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
section
504?
i
believe,
as
decided
by
the
district
court
it
would
have
required
the
closing
of
pennhurst.
it
mirrored
its
equal
protection
finding
which
was
that
pennhurst
as
a
large,
isolated
institution--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--i'm
not
sure
that
there
would
have
been
a
right
to
treatment
under
504.
i
think
there
was
simply
a
right
not
to
be
excluded
from
community
activities
and
federal
programs--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--by
the
district
court.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
the
due
process
clause
and
the
quid
pro
quo
theory
of
right
to
treatment.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir,
and
also
the
eight
amendment
in
terms
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
those
holdings
in
our
understanding
are
not
before
the
court
today.
because
the...
well,
i
should
also
describe
the
order
of
the
district
court.
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
that
pennhurst
be
closed,
that
the
state
and
counties
create
community
placements
for
all
those
at
pennhurst,
and
all
those
2,000
on
its
waiting
list;
and
that
a
master
supervise
and
direct
those
activities
as
well
as
the
interim
operation
of
pennhurst.
the
court
of
appeals
broke
entirely
new
ground.
it
asked
for
a
separate
briefing
on
and
decided
the
case
under
the
developmental
disabilities
act,
the
developmentally
disabled
assistance
and
bill
of
rights
act.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
as
i
read
the
opinion,
it
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
and
found
that
the
spending
power
had
been
exercised.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
that
is
part
of
our
position,
certainly.
the
violation
here
is
to
use
federal
funds
and
violate
the
conditions
of
those
federal
funds.
therefore
the
remedy
is
to
cut
off
the
federal
funds,
if
in
fact
a
violation
is
found.
that
is
our
position
on
the
remedy;
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
no,
sir,
i
think,
both
the
courts...
as
i
understand
it,
certainly
the
district
court
recognized
that
there
is
no
affirmative
constitutional
right
to
provide
treatment.
what
it
said
was,
in
essence
was,
if
you
do,
you
must
meet
certain
standards.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
no,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem
if
pennsylvania
decided...
as
it
is
not
likely
to
do,
of
course...
that
it
would
drop
mental
retardation
services.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
excuse
me?
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
no,
sir.
it
was
in
the
final
amended
complaints
of
one
of
the
intervenors
and
the
original
plaintiff.
it
was,
so
far
as
i
know,
not
briefed
post
trial.
it
was
not
briefed
post
trial
and
it
was
not
briefed--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--it
was
considered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
it
was,
on
the
request--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--of
the
court
of
appeals.
none
of
the
parties
asserted
it
in
their
original
briefs.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
i
don't
think
anybody...
there
are
references
to
katzenbach,
which
of
course
would
be
the
relevant
decision
in
the
series
of
voting
rights
cases.
i
don't
read
the
briefs
to
expressly
assert
the
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
excuse
me?
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
think
at
least
one
of
the
respondents
certainly
claimed
that
this
was
an
exercise
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
power.
once
again,
not
directly,
they
cite
the
case
and
in
that
particular
brief,
which
is
the
parc
brief,
the
pennsylvania
association
for
retarded
citizens
brief;
they
refer
to
katzenbach.
and
as
i
understand
it,
as
they
go
along
they
then
contend
that
this
is
a
statute
which
sets
conditions
for
all
federal
funding.
i
don't
think--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--to
the
constitutional
argument?
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
the
argument
that
it
is
a
condition
of
all
federal
funding?
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
your
honor,
yes.
first
of
all,
on
the
basis
of
statutory
construction,
and
that
is
that
the
statute
will
not
stand
that
construction.
in
finding...
and
perhaps
it's
best
to
discuss
the
statute...
in
finding
a
right
to
treatment
in
this
statute,
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
a
section
entitled
"congressional
findings
respecting
the
rights
of
the
developmentally
disabled.
"
i
think
the
most
important
point
to
remember
is
that
this
court
has
never
found
substantive
rights
in
congressional
findings.
congressional
findings
set
a
predicate
for
congressional
action
and
for
the
courts
they
provide
a
means
of
interpreting
the
substantive
provisions
of
congressional
acts.
they
do
not
create
rights
in
and
of
themselves.
certainly
as
this
court
noted
in
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis,
when
congress
intends
to
impose
rights,
it
knows
how
to
do
so.
and
generally,
as
this
court
also
noted,
in
harris
v.
mcrae,
when
it
does
so
it
provides
funding
to
assist
in
the
implementation
of
those
obligations.
in
this
case
it
did
neither,
as
to
section
6010.
in
stark
contrast,
when
it
imposed
obligations...
and
once
again,
this
is
my
point:
the
obligations
in
the
act
do
not,
on
its
face,
go
beyond
the
funding.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
you
have
to
answer
the
first
adversely
to
us,
which
is
a
point
i
can't
reach,
i
just
don't
think
you
can
answer
that
first
question
adversely
to
us,
namely
that
the
act
goes
beyond
the
funding
under
the
statute
before
you
even
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
and
that
is
the
power,
if
congress
had
wished
to
impose
conditions
beyond
funding
under
the
act,
could
they
have
done
so?
and
we
contend,
first,
that
they
did
not.
and,
secondly,
that
they
could
not.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
it
is
cited
throughout
the
briefs.
i
was
referring
in
there
to
the
joint
appendix
on
the
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
submitted
as
the
appendix,
as
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
excuse
me.
it's
on
page
198(a).
it
is
also
cited
in
more
complete
text
at
page
171(a)
of
the
intervening
petitioners'--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--in
the
blue
appendix,
it
would
be
at
page
171(a),
and
that
is
the
more
complete
version.
once
again,
in
stark
contrast
to
section
6010,
when
congress
intended
to
impose
conditions
under
this
act
and
impose
obligations,
it
did
so
clearly,
it
did
so
by...
and
it
also
provided
funding
for
those
obligations.
it
did
provide
funding
for
protection
and
advocacy
systems,
saying
that
the
developmentally
disabled
should
have
available
counsel
and
advocacy
services
to
protect
their
rights
in
social
security
matters,
in
constitutional
matters,
in
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
and
administrative
hearings,
and
they
required
the
states
to
meet
certain
conditions
in
establishing
that
program.
but
they
did
provide
funding
for
that
as
well.
and,
explicitly,
the
conditions
of
that
funding
are
attached
to
the
funding.
secondly,
they
provided
for
certain
kinds
of
special
projects.
once
again
conditions
of
those
specials
projects
are
conditioned
on
receiving
funding
and
the
conditions
are
explicit.
finally,
they
provided
funding
for
states
which
wish
to
participate
in
the
planning,
coordination,
and
provision
of
services
advantages
of
the
act.
and
they
say,
if
you
want
these
funds,
you
must
submit
a
state
plan.
and
that
state
plan
must
comply
to
certain
requirements.
and
if
it
doesn't
comply,
you
don't
get
the
state
money.
and
those
conditions
are
very
specific.
and
in
addition
in
every
one
that
is
program-related,
it
is
additionally
limited.
it
is
limited
specifically
to
programs
assisted
by
funds
received
under
the
act.
the
creation
of
an
individualized
habilitation
plan,
which
was
described
by
trial
and
i
believe
in
the
legislative
history
as
a
crucial
element
of
treatment
for
the
retarded,
is
explicitly
made
a
requirement
only
for
those
who
are
in-program,
receiving
assistance
under
the
act.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
we
are
talking
about
a
specific
habilitation
program,
not
the
generic
mental
retardation
program.
the
conference
report
is
explicit
on
that.
we
are
talking
about
an
individual
person's
program,
and
that
program
must
meet
that
requirement,
not
the
generic
program.
the
second
requirement
which
has
some
relevance
in
this
case
is
the
requirement
that
the
rights
of
persons
in
programs
assisted
under
this
act
be
protected
consistent
with
section
6010.
i
submit
to
you
those
two
provisions
would
be
meaningless
if
6010
had
some
broader
application
or
had
any
application
in
terms
of
creating
rights.
the
act
does
do
important
things.
it
helps
the
states
to
plan
and
coordinate
their
services,
it
helps
them
to
work
through
demonstration
models
to
improve
their
services
for
the
retarded.
the
planning
and
coordination
aspect
is
probably
what
congress
has
focused
on
most,
in
terms
of
gap-filling,
in
terms
of
the
failure
of
certain
programs
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
retarded.
the
act
serves
an
important
purpose.
it
does
not
serve
the
broad
purposes
attributed
to
it
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
does
not
impose
the
kinds
of
obligations
that
that
court
found.
finally,
i
think
there
are
two
additional
points.
first,
when
this
court
interprets
federal
statutes,
i
think
it
does
defer
to
the
view
of
the
federal
government,
but
when
it
does
so
the
view
of
the
federal
government
that
it
defers
to
is
the
view
of
those
which
are
charged
with
implementing
the
statute.
and
if
you
look
at
those
views
as
manifested
by
how
they
implemented
this
statute,
there
are
several
problems.
indeed
none
of
their
activities,
none
of
their
actions
support
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
view
of
the
respondents
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
pennsylvania
has
received
uninterrupted
funding
under
the
developmentally
disabled
act.
certainly
hhs
does
not
believe
we
violated
that
act.
secondly,
the
regulations
provide
no
support
for
the
proposition
that
6010
is
mandatory.
it
describes
those,
its
references
to
deinstitutionalization
are
directory,
and
it
has
no
references
to
standards
for
institutions.
thirdly,
to
the
extent
that
anybody
can
argue
in
this
case
that
medicaid
funds
or
other
federal
funds
are
conditioned
on
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
act,
hhs
again
does
not
agree
and
neither
do
we,
because
they
have
supplied
uninterrupted
and
substantial
funding
for
pennhurst.
finally,
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
perhaps
even
today,
to
the
extent
that
the
thrust...
and
this
provided
a
thrust,
or
is
argued
to
provide
a
total
thrust
for
federal
funding,
the
federal
government
was
making
it
extremely
difficult...
and
the
record
is
clear
on
this...
if
not
impossible
to
receive
funding
for
community
placements.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir,
i
would
have.
but
i
think
the
important--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--certainly.
if
they'd
attempted
to
cut
off
our
funds,
there
is
an
appellate
process
and
i
suspect
we
would
have
utilized
it.
they
did
not
though,
and
the
point
i'm
making--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--i
believe
that
appellate
process
ended
up
in
court.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
they
could
not
have
done
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here.
and
they
did
not
attempt
to.
their
regulations
simply
don't
attempt
to.
and
that's
the
point
i'm
making.
if
you
look
at
their
actions,
interpreting
the
act...
in
1977,
i
believe,
their
regulations
were
published...
they
clearly
didn't
read
the
act
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did.
they
did
not
view
it
as
being
mandatory.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir.
that
is
our
position.
one
final
point,
if
i
may,
and
that
is,
at
trial
it
was
clear...
and,
in
fact,
in
the
halderman
respondents'
brief
it
is
conceded,
pennsylvania
has
been
a
leader
in
the
creation
of
community
programs.
it
has
created
them
well,
it
has
monitored
them
well,
it
has
moved
people
reasonably
well.
if
this
act
was
intended
to
put
our
community
placement
programs
under
direct
court
supervision...
and
let
me
point
out
that
this
was
not
a
conditioned
right,
this
was
not
a
phased-in
right.
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
this
right
went
into
effect
immediately
upon
passage
of
the
act,
this
obligation.
so,
theoretically,
immediately
upon
enactment
we
were
subject
to
court
supervision.
if
we
were
subject
to
court
supervision
as
a
leader
in
this
field,
what
did
that
mean
for
49
other
states?
and
is
that
what
congress
intended,
to
have
the
courts
become
case
managers,
in
essence,
for
the
mentally
retarded?
i
don't
believe
it
is
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
will
find
it
is.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
i'd
like
to
yield
my
time
to
mr.
klein
to
present
rebuttal
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners,
if
that
would
be
acceptable
to
you.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
your
honor,
there
are
two
branches
to
that
argument.
one
finds--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--if
found
that
there
was
$18
million
which
had
not
yet
been
spent,
but
it
had
been
committed
to
projects.
it
was
committed
to
creating
community
service
projects
as
opposed
to
community
living
arrangements.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
there
isn't.
we
would
contest
the
proposition
that
every
cla
is
cheaper
than
residential
placement,
and
we
would
say,
we
don't
know
whether
the
total
cost
of
the
entire
community
placement
program
would
exceed
that
of
residential
placement.
and
we
would
contend
that
there
is
a
substantial
transition
cost,
because
pennhurst
so
long
as
one
person
is
there
is
still
going
to
have
a
substantial
overhead.
so
to
talk
in
terms
of
comparing
costs
and
the
facilities
costs,
there
is
no
simple
answer.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
i
don't
think
on
a
federal
grant
statute
they
can
tell
us
how
to
spend
our
funds.
i
think
they
can
condition
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds
and
say
in
order
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
this
act--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
an
affirmative
order
against
the
state
to
spend
its
funds.
the
remedy
is
to
cut
off
the
federal
funds.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir.
the
federal
government
in
condition
of
a
grant
can
say
to
you,
we
give
you
this
much,
you
must
supplement
that
with
your
own
funds.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
yes,
sir.
i
understood
the
question,
though,
to
go
to
the
power
of
a
federal
court
in
enforcing
that
condition
and
order
us
to
spend--
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
--yes,
sir.
