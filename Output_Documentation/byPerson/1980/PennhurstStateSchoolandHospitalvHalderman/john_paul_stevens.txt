mr.
kittredge,
what
do
you
think
section
6010
does
mean?
justice
stevens
what
kind
of
right
is
it?
is
it
a
state
law
right,
a
federal
statutory
right,
or
a
constitutional
right?
justice
stevens
before
you
leave
the
section
6010,
is
it
not
correct
that
section
6010(3)
describes
an
obligation?
justice
stevens
do
you
just...
you
construe
that
as
creating
a
new
obligation
or
merely
a
prefatory-lire
6010(1)
and
(2)?
justice
stevens
well,
is
it
correct
then
that
under
your
reading
of
the
statute...
and
it
may
well
be
right...
that
the
statute
has
the
same
right-creating
and
duty-creating
effect
if
6010
were
totally
eliminated
from
the
statute?
justice
stevens
mr.
ferleger,
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
finish?
you
started
by
pointing
out
that
in
your
view
the
central
fact
is
that
the
residents
of
pennhurst
are
in
fact
harmed
by
being
residents
of
pennhurst.
judge
seitz
in
his
dissent
ends
up
by
saying
that
it
remains
open
to
you
to
show
that
the
particular
mode
of
treatment
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
state's
purpose
in
confining
people
at
pennhurst.
have
you,
in
your
view
of
the
record,
already
proved
that
as
to
every
resident
of
pennhurst?
justice
stevens
now,
if
that's
true,
judge
seitz's
view
of
the
law
requires
the
same
result
as
the
majority?
justice
stevens
just
a
different
legal
predicate
for
the
same
relief?
justice
stevens
but
the
difference,
i
suppose,
is
that
it
would
remain
open
to
your
opponents
to
make
sufficiently
dramatic
changes
in
pennhurst
so
that
the
purpose
of
confinement
would
be
fulfilled?
justice
stevens
but,
general
days,
is
it
not
correct
that
in
this
litigation
the
united
states
did
not
raise
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
violation
of
this
statute
until
after
the
3rd
circuit
on
its
own
motion
brought
the
issue
into
the
case?
justice
stevens
and
in
your
intervention
you
did
not
allege
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
general
days,
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
that
if
this
is
just
an
exercise
of
the
spending
power,
the
amount
of
money
appropriated
by
the
federal
government
is
wholly
inadequate
to
achieve
the
purposes
that
your
construction
of
the
statute
would
require?
justice
stevens
but
he
has
taken
a
position.
you
are
arguing,
are
you
not,
that
there
is
an
affirmative
obligation
comply
with
the
statute,
regardless
of
the
spending
power?
that's
the
way
i
understood
your
argument.
justice
stevens
you
did?
well,
i'm
not
sure
your
answer
to
justice
powell
really
confronts
the
problem,
because
admittedly
you
might
not,
a
federal
court
might
not
enjoin
the
legislature.
the
question
perhaps
should
be,
could
they
enjoin
these
parties
requiring
that
it
do
just
what
the
district
court
did,
in
the
face
of
a
showing
that
the
money
isn't
there?
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
is,
yes,
they
could.
justice
stevens
it's
not
a
defense
to
a
constitutional
violation
or
to
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute
that
i
don't
have
enough
money
to
comply.
