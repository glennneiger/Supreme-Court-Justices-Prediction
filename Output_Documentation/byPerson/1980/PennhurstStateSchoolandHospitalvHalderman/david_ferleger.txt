mr.
david
ferleger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
monumental
inhumanity
of
our
nation's
institutions
for
the
retarded
cannot
be
encompassed
in
any
recital
of
the
abuse
and
neglect
which
the
lower
courts
found
at
pennhurst.
because
the
enforced
inactivity,
the
unbroken
aloneness,
pale
beside
the
central
fact
that
brings
us
to
this
court,
and
that
fact
is
the
affirmative
regression
and
harms
caused
to
people
at
pennhurst
xx
but
the
fact
that
people
at
pennhurst
there
for
retardation
habilitation
go
backwards;
people
became
more
retarded.
people
lose
skills
that
they
had
when
they
entered
the
institution.
that
tragedy
in
essence
is
a
lack
of
life,
a
lack
of
the
challenges
and
changes
and
questions
that
life
presents
to
us
that
we
need,
and
retarded
people
equally
need,
to
develop.
that
denial
for
the
retarded
is
what
is
called
the
denial
of
habilitation.
mr.
david
ferleger
we
would
have
been
in
this
court
on
constitutional
grounds
had
congress
not
enacted
the
act
after
i
filed
the
lawsuit
in
1974.
mr.
david
ferleger
we're
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
the
states
to
provide
protection
from
denial
of
particular
constitutional
rights,
which
include
the
right
to
habilitation.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
sorts
of
rights
i'm
discussing
are
rights
enunciated
in
this
court
in
rodriguez,
the
right
to
more
than
zero
education.
the
right--
mr.
david
ferleger
--in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause,
and
in
the
eighth
amendment,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
a
denial
of
a
right
to
care
once
someone
is
in
a
retardation
program
is,
i
think,
different
than
a
refusal
of
the
state
to
create
such
a
program.
what
we
have
here
are
people
institutionalized,
already
harmed
by
the
state,
already
subjected,
in
jackson
v.
indiana's
words,
"to
institutionalization
the
purpose
and
the
nature
and
duration
of
which
have
no
relation
to
its
purpose.
"
but
even--
mr.
david
ferleger
--no,
i
would
not.
i
would
not
make
that
argument.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
and
it's
our
position--
mr.
david
ferleger
--yes,
we
do.
we
join
in
defending
the
court
below.
but,
of
course,
this
court
need
not
reach
that
particular
issue,
because
under
the
standards
enunciated
most
recently
in
fullilove
and
related
cases,
this
court
has
found
that
congress
may
elaborate
on
fourteenth
amendment
protections
through
enforcing
the
amendment
under
the
section
5.
and
that
sort
of
enforcement,
remedial
enforcement,
is
exactly
what
the
congress
intended
to
do
in
enacting
the
developmental
disabilities
act.
throughout
the
legislative
history
it's
clear
that
the
congress
intended
to
enforce
and
remedy
violations
of
the
constitution,
including
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
ferleger
pennsylvania
has
been
a
leader
in
this
field.
pennsylvania
has
created
as
of
1976
community
services
that
had
served
more
than
3,000
individuals.
so
that,
for
pennsylvania,
the
expansion
and
transfer
of
resources
to
the
community
has
not
been
and
will
not
be
a
difficult
task.
we're
not
talking,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
about
creating
new
services.
we're
talking
about
a
retardation
program
that
needs
its
resources
shifted.
there
already
is
in
pennsylvania
millions
of
dollars
of
funds
available
and
unspent
for
community
services,
unspent
since
1970.
there
is
available
in
the
country
more
than
$3
billion
today
in
federal
money
going
to
retardation
services,
all
of
which
can
be
used
to
continue
to
provide
the
services
but
now
provide
habilitation,
and
not
custodial
care,
not
regression.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
don't
agree.
i
think
that
this
court
can
find,
and
in
fact
it
appears
from
the
argument
so
far
to
be
conceded,
that
people
at
pennhurst
have
been
denied
habilitation.
once
that
judicial
determination
of
liability
is
made,
the
next
question
is
remedy.
and
as
to
remedy,
i
believe,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
that
the
remedy
for
each
state
is
going
to
be
different.
the
nature
of
the
creation,
the
way
in
which
it
proceeds,
will
be
different
in
the
various
states.
pennsylvania,
it
happens,
has
funds
available,
has
a
program
in
place,
and
the
creation
of
an
ihp,
individual
habilitation
plan,
and
services,
is
something
that
pennsylvania
is
doing;
the
federal
court
is
not
doing
it,
the
special
master
is
not
doing
it.
pennsylvania
is
doing
it
and
has
done
it,
and
from
all
indications
in
the
record
intended
to
close
pennhurst
by
1983.
so
that
the
remedy
question
in
this
case,
i
submit,
is
an
easy
one,
and
the
liability
question
appears
to
be
virtually
conceded.
congress
was
not
content
with
prohibiting
abuse
or
enhancing
the
institutions.
congress
instead
demanded
that
people
not
be
dumped
from
inadequate
institutions
into
more
inadequate
care
in
the
community.
congress
did
not
create
a
right
to
lose
your
abilities
by
leaving
the
institution.
congress
required
an
affirmative
right
to
habilitation.
this
is
an
anti-dumping
case.
this
case
seeks
to
assure
services,
not
to
deny
services
to
people.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
and
mr.--
mr.
david
ferleger
--both
the
spending
power
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
the
court...
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
said
in
fullilove,
congress
used
an
amalgam
of
its
power.
and
i
want
to
correct
a
statement
earlier.
at
pages
117(a)
to
118(a),
the
3rd
circuit's
opinion,
they
exclusively
held
that
the
rights
of
6010
come
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
ferleger
they
said
that
because
they
rested
it
on
that
they
don't
have
to
reach
the
more
difficult
questions--
mr.
david
ferleger
--that
is
correct.
and
that
is
true
here,
because
the
state
has
failed,
and
the
facts
are
not
contested.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
not
correct
and
let
me
explain
why.
congress
was
very
clear
in
'75
and
again
in
1978
that
its
intention--
mr.
david
ferleger
--and
that
is
why
congress
said,
we
are
creating
the
dd
program
to
meld,
in
congress's
words,
"into
a
cohesive
client-centered
thrust"
all
the
other
multi-habilitative
programs.
mr.
david
ferleger
medicaid,
medicare,
vocational
rehabilitation,
right
to
education
for
the
handicapped...
congress
noted
all
those
in--
mr.
david
ferleger
--this
is
a
requirement
that
the
funds
under
medicaid,
funds
which
go
to
pennhurst,
for
example,
be
used
to
provide
habilitation,
not
to
make
people
regress.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
he
doesn't
quite
say
that.
he
says
in
rosado
v.
wyman
that
the
plaintiffs
below
are
entitled
to
an
injunction
saying,
no
funds.
nowhere
in
that
opinion
does
justice
harlan
say
that
that's
the
only
remedy.
and
in
fact
the
district
court
had
in
that
case
issued
an
order
to
the
state
regarding
the
benefits
and
the
question
of
whether
to
funds
is
the
only
remedy
was
not
before
the
court
in
rosado.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
lau
v.
nichols
the
court
said...
and
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
in
fullilove
in
a
separate
section
repeats
the
language...
that
affirmative
relief
is
possible
and
required
even
though
there
was
a
cutoff
remedy
available
to
provide
education
for
the
chinese
students.
mr.
david
ferleger
oh,
that's...
i'm
talking
about
a
section
5
case,
not
simply
the
spending
power
case.
in
this
case
i
think
we
have
both.
and
i
agree
that
there
are
constitutional
difficulties
with
imposing
affirmative
obligations
under
the
spending
power.
i
think
the
section
5
power
is
what
gives--
mr.
david
ferleger
--section
5?
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
for
example.
but
under
the
dd
act
congress
can
create
obligations.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
medicaid
is
one
example,
and
it
seems--
mr.
david
ferleger
--no
upon
the
1960
funds,
but
upon
all
the
funds
that
continue...
$3
billion
this
year...
to
pour
into
these
institutions,
congress
can
impose
those
conditions,
and
change
the
conditions,
as
congress
does
frequently.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
a
difficult
question,
mr.
justice
powell,
because--
mr.
david
ferleger
--although
it's
not
raised
by
this
case,
my
answer
would
be
that
a
state
could
only
withdraw
if
it
assured
that
the
people
who
had
been
and
are
being
benefited
by
the
funds
are
not
harmed.
the
difficulty
that
that
would--
mr.
david
ferleger
--the
difficulty
of
the
question
is
that
people
currently
receiving
services,
i
think,
would
need
to
be
assured
of
a
lack
of
further
harm
for
the
state
to
withdraw.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
a
court
would
be
obligated.
mr.
david
ferleger
excuse
me?
yes.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes,
they
would.
in
this
case,
because
congress
was
remedying
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
congress
can
make
determinations
as
to
remedy
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
this
court
having
to
find
a
specific
constitutional
right.
mr.
david
ferleger
if
congress
cut
off
appropriations?
mr.
david
ferleger
then,
your
honor,
we'd
be
back
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
david
ferleger
in
that
situation,
in
pennsylvania,
for
my
clients
at
pennhurst--
mr.
david
ferleger
--no,
no.
we
would
be
in
court
on
the
constitutional
issues,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
ferleger
not
against
the
congress,
not
against
the
federal
government,
but
against
the
state--
mr.
david
ferleger
--for
denying
people's
rights
at
the
institution.
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
david
ferleger
it's
not
assuming
the
burden;
states
have
the
burden.
mr.
david
ferleger
i'm
talking
about
the
dollar
amount
also,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
uncontested
facts
in
this
case
show,
and
the
national
information
in
the
amicus
briefs
is
identical,
and
congress
found
it
to
be
true,
that
the
institutional
care
would
more
than
cover
the
community
care.
there's
no
new
dollars
being
demanded
from
the
states.
the
money
is
there,
in
pennsylvania
and
across
the
country,
the
state
money
that
already
is
supporting
the
institutions.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
issue
then
would
be
whether...
whatever
the
state
did
in
that
case
to
the
retarded
individuals
would
continue
to
be
a
harm
to
them,
in
which
case
i
think
the
constitution
would
be
violated.
mr.
david
ferleger
and
in
that
case
i
think
the
court
could
affirmatively
require
a
protection
from
harm,
the
sorts
the
compensatory
relief
that
the
court
found
justified
in
milliken
v.
bradley.
the
counseling,
the
assistance,
the
same
sorts
of
relief
in
milliken.
mr.
david
ferleger
half
the
residents
are
committed
by
a
court.
about
half,
according
to
the
record,
are
committed
through
application
of
parents
or
guardians.
however,
all--
mr.
david
ferleger
--the
procedures?
mr.
david
ferleger
no,
we
do
not
challenge
the
procedures.
all
but
two
of
the
residents
are
over
18.
all
but
two
of
the
current
1,000
residents
of
pennhurst
are
adults.
mr.
david
ferleger
were
originally
committed
that
way.
the
difficulty
is--
mr.
david
ferleger
--committed
by
a
court.
mr.
david
ferleger
of
various
parties.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
current
law,
because
of
goldy
v.
beal,
a
case
striking
down
the
commitment
statute,
the
current
law
cited
in
my
brief,
goldy
v.
beal
and
implementing
regulations,
is
that
no
one
can
be
committed
by
a
court
to
pennhurst
or
any
other
retardation
institution
unless
there's
a
finding
that
no
community
service
can
be
made
available.
that
is
a
state
regulation
and
a
consent
decree
issued
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
david
ferleger
committed
in
accordance
with
the
statutes
in
effect
at
the
time.
however,
the
district
court
found
that
for
those
residents
who
say,
i
want
to
leave,
pennhurst
goes
to
court
to
commit
them.
if
you
don't
say
anything,
even
if
you're
50
or
80
years
old,
then
pennhurst
assumes
you
still
want
to
be
there.
so
that
the
district
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld,
that
every
resident
is
there
involuntarily.
mr.
david
ferleger
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
david
ferleger
it
was
in
pennsylvania
court.
mr.
david
ferleger
it
was
not
a
state
court;
it
was
a
federal
court.
mr.
david
ferleger
your
honor,
we
have
proved
that
five
times
over.
the
state
has--
mr.
david
ferleger
--yes,
it
does.
absolutely,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
we
have
shown
and
there's
no
contest
that
for
every
person
at
pennhurst,
community
life
is
not
only
possible,
but
there
is
someone
with
the
same
disabilities
now
living
in
the
community
and
getting
proper
community
services.
mr.
david
ferleger
that's
correct.
and
they
have
never
suggested
that
they
could
do
that
or
that
they
would
want
to
do
it.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
court
of
appeals
requires
an
individual
determination,
as
congress
expected,
of
what
people
need.
and
that
is--
mr.
david
ferleger
--in
fact,
it
specifically
says
they
are
not
finding
that
pennhurst
must
be
closed.
thank
you.
