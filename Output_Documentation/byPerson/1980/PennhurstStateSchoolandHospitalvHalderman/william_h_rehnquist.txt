justice
rehnquist
mr.
warshaw,
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
what
power
to
legislate
do
you
understand
it
thought
that
congress
was
acting
under
when
it
passed
this
developmental
act?
justice
rehnquist
if
it's
simply
the
spending
power,
isn't
the
ordinary
remedy
for
the
violation
of
the
spending
power
the
cutting
off
of
funds?
justice
rehnquist
though
those
are
really
two
discrete
questions,
aren't
they?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
the
second
ground
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
purported
to
avoid
the
constitutional
questions,
really
necessarily
implicating
constitutional
questions
through
the
back
door?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
3rd
circuit
has
not,
then,
avoided
a
constitutional
question
by
its
second
holding?
justice
rehnquist
where
do
those
funds
come
from?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
ferleger,
you
say
that
it's
this
situation
which
brings
you
to
this
court.
would
you
say
you
would
be
in
this
court
in
the
same
posture
had
it
not
been
for
the
congressional
enactments
of
'77
and
'78?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
each
state
to
provide
some
sort
of
care
for
the
type
of
people
you
describe?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
rehnquist
what
if,
unlike
jackson
v.
indiana,
the
state
simply
had
never
set
about
to
create
any
sort
of
institutions
for
the
mentally
retarded?
would
you
say
that
the
federal
constitution
required
them
affirmatively
to
set
up
such?
justice
rehnquist
but
we
have
to
presumably
write
a
principal
opinion,
if
we
sustain
your
position.
and
it
can't
be
on
the
basis
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
millions
of
dollars
unspent
that
it
could
just
as
easily
transfer
to
the
kind
of
facilities
you
wish.
it
has
to
be
something
applicable
to
all
fifty
states.
justice
rehnquist
but
even
if
that
be
true,
what
do
you
do
with
justice
harlan's
language
of
rosado
v.
wyman,
where
he
says
that
if
you
don't
like
it,
just
don't
take
the
funds?
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
say
the
strong
implication
of
the
rosado
opinion
is
just
a
cutoff
of
funds?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
was
something
that
was
based
not
just
on
the
spending
power?
justice
rehnquist
what
court
was
it
that
decided
goldy
v.
beal?
justice
rehnquist
so
it
was
not
a
pennsylvania
court?
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
it
was
not
a
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
general
days,
in
section
6011
of
what
has
been
referred
to
as
d&d,
it
starts
out
with
the
statement,
"conditions
for
receiving
state
allotment:
the
secretary
shall
require
as
a
condition
to
a
state's
receiving
an
allotment
under
subchapter
3
of
this
chapter
that
the
state
provide
the
secretary
with
satisfactory
assurances.
"
was
that
complied
with
in
each
year
subsequent
to
the
adoption?
did
the
the
secretary
receive
assurances
and
did
she
approve
them,
or,
did
he
approve
them,
whoever
the
secretary
was?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
commonwealth
isn't
challenging
the
secretary's
determination.
justice
rehnquist
the
commonwealth
isn't
challenging
the
secretary's
determination.
justice
rehnquist
but
mr.
days,
couldn't
you
have
prevented
that
somehow
within
the
executive
branch?
if
one
arm
of
the
executive
branch
was
doling
out
these
funds
and
the
justice
department
felt
that
it
was
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
couldn't
that
have
been
corrected
short
of
the
federal
courts?
justice
rehnquist
but
doesn't
congress
have
budgetary
control
over
the
federal
executive
institutions
and
oversight
powers
too?
justice
rehnquist
when
was
6010?
justice
rehnquist
and
when
was
this
comment
that
you
have
referred
to?
justice
rehnquist
it
was
sometime
during
the
year
1975
that
the
state
of
the
art
changed?
justice
rehnquist
but
then,
wouldn't
that
be
a
violation
of
the
statutory
act,
the
bill
of
rights,
if
the
states
simply
say
they
quit
and
are
not
providing
these
mental
patients
with
any
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
congress
has
announced
they
have?
justice
rehnquist
which
horn
of
the
dilemma
do
you
choose?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stewart's
question
a
moment
ago
that
no
federal
court
could
enjoin
the
pennsylvania
legislature
to
appropriate
funds
to
implement
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
pennhurst,
the
first
of
the
cases
which
we
have
filed
an
opinion
with
the
clerk
with
today,
the
respondents
are
patients
at
the
pennhurst
state
school
and
hospital,
an
institution
in
pennsylvania
for
the
care
and
treatment
of
the
mentally
retarded.
they
brought
suit
against
pennhurst
and
various
officials
responsible
for
its
operations
alleging
that
the
inhumane
and
dangerous
conditions
deprived
them
of
various
constitutional
and
statutory
rights.
they
urge
that
pennhurst
be
closed
and
that
they
be
moved
to
smaller
less
isolated
institutions.
the
federal
district
court
found
that
certain
of
the
claimed
rights
were
violated
and
granted
the
relief
sought.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed
on
different
grounds.
it
construed
the
developmentally
disabled
assistance
and
bill
of
rights
act
of
1975
enacted
by
congress
and
founded
section
6010
of
that
act
created
of
mentally
retarded
persons,
a
“right
to
appropriate
treatment”
in
the
“least
restrictive
environment”.
the
act
itself
established
a
federal-state
grant
program
whereby
the
federal
government
will
provide
financial
assistance
to
any
state
which
agrees
to
comply
with
certain
conditions.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
because
pennsylvania
accepted
federal
funds
under
the
act,
it
was
bound
under
section
6010
to
provide
appropriate
treatments
of
--
of
patients
of
pennhurst.
we
disagree
in
an
opinion
which
we
have
filed
today
with
the
court
--
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
in
our
view,
section
6010
only
expresses
a
congressional
preference
for
certain
kinds
of
treatment.
it
does
not
grant
rights
to
patients
or
require
the
states
to
provide
special
treatment.
we
do
find,
however,
that
certain
other
sections
of
the
act
which
were
not
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
may
place
certain
conditions
on
the
state.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall
has
filed
a
dissent
in
part.
