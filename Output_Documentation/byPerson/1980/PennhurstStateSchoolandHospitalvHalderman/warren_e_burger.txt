chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
first
this
morning
pennhurst
state
school
and
hospital
v.
halderman
and
the
consolidated
cases.
mr.
warshaw,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
if
the
state
of
pennsylvania
simply
threw
up
its
hands
and
said,
this
whole
problem
is
just
insoluble;
we
can't
cope
with
it.
so,
we'll
close
all
the
institutions
and
let
things
be
cared
for
as
they
were
100
years
ago
or
150
years
ago,
would
you
think
a
constitutional
question
would
arise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kittredge.
chief
justice
burger
if
it
isn't
there,
will
you
supply
it
to
us?
chief
justice
burger
if
you're
not
sure
that
it's
in
the
amicus
brief.
it
might
be
helpful
if
you'd
give
us
a
copy
of
it
if
it
isn't
published
formally
in
fed.
sup.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
burger
could
congress
have
prescribed
all
of
the
conditions
and
limitations
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
laid
down?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferleger.
chief
justice
burger
--then
you
don't
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
could,
or
any
other
state,
could
close
all
of
its
institutions
and
simply
say,
people
will
have
to
take
care
of
their
own,
as
they
did
100
or
200
years
ago?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
congress
cut
off
appropriations
for
the
6010-type
programs?
chief
justice
burger
just
stopped
appropriating
money?
chief
justice
burger
now,
the
state
then
must
assume
all
the
burden
on?
chief
justice
burger
no,
the
dollar...
i'm
talking
about
the
dollar
amount.
chief
justice
burger
now,
then,
take
it
one
more
step.
when
the
state
of
pennsylvania
stops
appropriating
money,
just
says,
we
can't
afford
this
program,
or
we
think
it's
wasteful,
or
whatever,
the
legislature
just
doesn't
give
it
any
more
money.
what
then?
chief
justice
burger
and
what
would
be
the
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
days.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
anything,
mr.
days,
is
there
anything
in
the
evidence
that
demonstrates
that
it
is
the
custody
that
has
caused
that,
or
is
it
possible
that
that
was
the
natural
course
of
the
unfortunate
condition?
chief
justice
burger
the
point
i
was
inquiring
about
was,
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
that
a
particular
patient
who
has
suffered
regression,
may
not
have
suffered
that
same
regression
if
they
had
stayed
at
home,
or
been
somewhere
else?
chief
justice
burger
do
the
experts
really
know
whether
this
regression...
and
take
the
child,
the
younger
person...
comes
from
the
environment
or
comes
from
a
sense
of
abandonment
by
the
parents?
do
they
really
know
which?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gilhool.
chief
justice
burger
let's
take
it
one
more
step.
how
do
they
enforce
it?
chief
justice
burger
how
do
the
courts
enforce
this?
by
contempt?
chief
justice
burger
now,
let's
assume
the
money,
this
state
money
just
stops,
and
no
more
state
money
is
available,
and
what's
the
remedy
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
something?
chief
justice
burger
i
guess
there
isn't
a
short
answer.
thank
you.
would
you
agree...
well,
let
me
pursue
that.
would
you
agree
that...
if
the
state
money,
the
state
has
money
available,
which
is
subject
to
the
conditions
of
the
federal
grant,
that
a
federal
court
could
direct
and
require
to
be
spent
to
implement
and
carry
out
the
federal
conditions?
chief
justice
burger
they
can
only
stop
the
federal
flow
of
funds,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
and
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
pennhurst
state
school
&
hospital
against
halderman
and
the
consolidated
cases
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
along
with
a
second
case,
united
parcel
service,
incorporated
against
mitchell.
