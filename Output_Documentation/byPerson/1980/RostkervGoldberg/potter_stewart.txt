justice
stewart
do
all
males
in
that
age
group
have
to
register?
justice
stewart
but
all
males
including
ministers
and--
justice
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general...
we
began
interrupting
you
with
our
questions
and
i'm
now
continuing
the
interruption...
you
stated
that
the
three-judge
district
court
held
that
this
statute
was
constitutionally
invalid
because
it
invidiously
discriminated
against
men?
justice
stewart
that's
clear,
is
it?
justice
stewart
and
you
don't
have
to
say
that
only
gender
base?
justice
stewart
correct.
justice
stewart
of
course,
korematsu
was
decided
at
a
time
when
it
had
not
been
held
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
incorporated
the
standards
of
equal
protection.
that
was
first
held
in
bolling
v.
sharpe,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
and
korematsu
antedated
that
decision.
justice
stewart
that
was
the
other
one.
justice
stewart
wouldn't
that
objective
be
equally
undermined
by
excluding
everybody
under
18
and
everybody
over
26?
justice
stewart
that
includes
an
awful
lot
of
people
with
a
lot
of
different
and
varied
experiences.
justice
stewart
that
the
military
could
well
use,
i
suppose.
justice
stewart
you
did
not
attack
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute
based
upon
its
discrimination
in
favor
of
everybody
in
this
country
under
18
years
of
age
and
everybody
in
this
country
over
26
years
of
age?
justice
stewart
that
was
within
the
military
as
well.
justice
stewart
that
was
within
the
military.
justice
stewart
it
was
not
a
court
opinion
in
frontiero,
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
not
a
court
opinion,
so
it's
difficult
to
say
what
it
was
based
on.
justice
stewart
reed
v.
reed,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
the
test
is
a
test
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as--
justice
stewart
like
kahn
and
shevin?
justice
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me...
maybe
i'm
out
of
step,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
the
cart
before
the
horse.
i
don't
think,
i
have
never
understood
that
it
was
up
to
the
government
to
justify
an
act
of
congress.
i
had
thought
that
an
act
of
congress
is
presumptively
valid,
and
that
it's
up
to
you
to
show
why
it's
invalid.
justice
stewart
well,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
congress
here
exercised
one
of
its
explicit
powers
under
the
constitution
and
with
that
you
don't
agree?
you
do
agree.
justice
stewart
and
i
didn't
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
suggest,
and
i
hope
he
didn't
suggest,
that
congress
even
in
the
exercise
of
an
explicit
power
such
as
this
is
not
governed
by
the
explicit
prohibitions
in
the
constitution,
and
one
of
them
is
contained
in
the
fifth
amendment,
and
that's
the
one
upon
which
you
rely.
and
that's
really
the
issue
here.
but
the
statute
is
presumptively
valid,
isn't
it,
like
any
statute
enacted
by
any
legislature?
justice
stewart
there
is
no
question
of
the
power.
justice
stewart
and
the
question
is,
is
that
power
limited
or
prohibited?
justice
stewart
well,
perhaps...
maybe
the
court
has
said
that,
but
i
trust
i
never
have
because
i
don't
think
they're
defending
a
statute,
i
think
you're
attacking
it.
