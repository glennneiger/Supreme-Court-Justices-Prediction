mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
there
are
four
propositions,
none
of
which
is
seriously
disputed
in
this
case,
which
place
into
perspective
just
what
is
and
what
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
think
these
are
four
points
of
reference
of
which
we
ought
not
lose
sight.
first,
registering
women
for
the
draft
does
not
dictate
any
number
of
women
who
will
be
drafted
nor
the
roles
which
they
would
fill
if
they
were
drafted.
instead,
registration
of
women
opens
the
possibility
of
drafting
women
to
fill
the
very
positions
in
which
they
may
now
or
in
the
future
serve
as
volunteers
if
there
is
not
an
adequate
rate
of
volunteers
for
those
positions.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
the
case.
one
of
the
issues
that
the
district
court
specifically
said
was
not
before
it
and
would
in
fact
be
inconsistent
with
its
rationale
and
the
rationale
of
this
suit
is--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--inconsistent
in
that
the
theory
of
this
suit
and
the
theory
of
the
district
court
was
that
you
register
people
as
an
inventory.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
register
equally
as
insurance
against
an
unpredictable
future.
we
don't
know
what
needs
are
going
to
eventuate.
we
don't
know
what
the
assignment
policies
are
going
to
be
when
they
do.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true,
that
we
can
say
that
none
will
be
drafted.
the
important
point
is,
we
don't
know
who
will
be
drafted.
if
most--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--it
is
safe
to
assume,
i
think,
that
over--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--no,
your
honor,
i
have
to
disagree
with
that.
there
is,
of
course,
a
connection
between
registration
and
drafting.
but
what's
important
is
that
the
connection
is
not
that
we
draft
everyone
we
register
or
that
we
draft
randomly--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--i
would
concede,
indeed,
i
would
embrace
the
point
that
the
military
needs
at
the
time
that
mobilization
is
necessary
ought
to
dictate
the
proportion
in
which
men
or
women
are
drafted.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
there
may
be
at
a
given
time.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
it
would
support
a
differential
induction.
it
would
not
support
a
differential
registration.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
yes;
based
upon
military
needs.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case.
questions
of
constitutionality
and
retroactivity
would,
i
think,
generally
be
resolved
against
the
retroactivity
of
the
decision.
in
a
case
like
this
i
would
note
that
both
the
factual
setting
and
the
legal
standard
have
been
developing
over
time
and
i
don't
see
the
kinds
of
clear
signposts
to
retroactivity
that
are
usually
associated
with
rendering
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
to
be--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
i
think
that
the
court
decided
that
in
feeney
and
noting
in
feeney
that
the
result
of
the
veterans'
preference
winds
up
disproportionately
favoring
men
was
a
function
of
the
service,
which,
incidentally,
was
a
result
of
the
inequality
of
conscription,
among
other
things.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
require
the
voiding
of
any
veterans'
preference
statutes
because
the
fact
is
still
that
the
people
served
and
earned
their
veterans'
preference
as
opposed
to
being
registered
to
serve.
and
i
think
that,
again,
we
come
to
the
question,
we
can
no
more
say
who
would
have
been
drafted
than
we
can
say
who
will
be
drafted.
and
it's
that,
particularly
that
prospective
uncertainty
that
we
don't
know
today
what
the
military
needs
will
be
if
and
when
we
ever
have
to
draft,
that
is
really
the
distinction
between
registration
on
the
one
hand
and
conscription
on
the
other.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
well,
we
go
well
beyond
saying--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--that's
true,
your
honor.
we
do
go
well
beyond
saying
that
what
congress
did
was
merely
illogical.
it
was
in
fact
directly
contrary
to
the
ostensible
purpose,
the
declared
purpose
of
the
statute
and
for
that
reason
could
even
be
fairly
characterized
as
not
having
a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
articulated
or
obvious
governmental
interest.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
deny
the
existence
of
such
a
statute.
with
respect
to
the
army,
there
is
none.
with
respect
to
the
navy,
there
is
no
statute
barring
women
from
combat,
merely
from
assignment
to
ships
or
airplanes
with
combat
missions.
for
example,
in
the
navy,
women
are
eligible
for
assignment
to
the
seals,
which
is
the
navy
version
of
the
green
beret
special
forces.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
you
mean
the
statute?
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
it
would
not
directly
implicate
that
statute.
i
would
point
out
that
for
now
several
years
both
the
air
force
and
the
navy,
which
are
the
only
two
services
subject
to
such
statutes,
have
been
requesting
the
repeal
of
such
statutes
on
grounds
having
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
registration
or
the
draft,
but
merely
having
to
do
with
their
own
military
management.
so
what
we're
really
talking
about
is,
i
think,
the
army
situation
where
the
army
now
has
the
right
to
decide
assignment
questions
according
to
its
own
lights,
according
to
its
own
perceived
needs,
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
which
distinguishes
particularly
admiral
hayward's
testimony,
because
when
he
said,
we
will
be
able
to
fill
it,
he
was
talking
about
the
navy
and
the
naval
requirement
for
women
is
very
small
because
the
freedom
of
assignment
in
the
navy
is
very
small.
in
the
army
it's
a
very
different
case.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
this
case
does
not
raise
that.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
no.
it's
irrelevant
to
the
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
that
is
correct.
indeed,
the...
one
of
the
most
important
points
that
i
would
hope
to
make
is
that
the
district
court
assumed
the
continuing
applicability
of
all
current
limitations
in
all
services
on
numbers
and
assignments
of
women,
and
still
found
as
a
fact
that
all-male
registration
did
not
enhance
military
flexibility
or
the
ability
of
the
nation
to
respond
to
the
full
range
of
possible
futures
which
might
confront
us.
more
importantly,
in
fact,
it
found
that
the
exclusion
of
women
from
registration
undermined
military
flexibility
and
that
is
a
finding
of
fact
which
has
not
been
attacked
here
as
clearly
erroneous.
and
on
the
record,
i
submit,
could
not
be
attacked
as
clearly
erroneous--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
well,
the
finding
of
fact
that
military
flexibility
is
in
fact
undermined
by
exclusion
does
not
depend
upon
what
test
is
used
in
the
analysis.
that's
a
finding
of
fact
that
is
based
directly
on
the
testimony
of
the
military,
and
i
would
only
comment
here
what
the
testimony
of
all
of
the
joint
chiefs
was,
and
that
was,
we
should
register--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
no,
your
honor.
we
certainly
would
concede
the
legitimacy
of
the
governmental
interest
in
raising
an
adequate
armed
force.
that
is
indeed
the
statutory
purpose.
what
it
would
go
to
is
the
rational
relationship,
or
on
a
heightened
scrutiny
basis,
the
substantial
and
close
relationship
to
that
interest,
and
in
fact
the
finding
of
facts
here
as
supported
by
the
overwhelming
record
is
that
the
exclusion
of
women
from
registration,
which
means
excluding
them
from
the
pool
of
people
to
whom
we
can
turn
in
time
of
war,
in
time
of
emergency,
for
the
skills
that
we
know
they
do
possess
and
the
very
skills
that
we
have
sought
to
bring
into
the
armed
forces
by
increasing
the
female
volunteer
rate
and
the
level
or
volunteer
soldiers,
we
would
exclude
ourselves
from
being
able
to
turn
to
those
and
the
district
court
found,
and
i
submit,
correctly,
certainly
not
clearly
erroneously,
that
that
objective
is
undermined
by
excluding
women
from
the
registration
pool.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
i
think
not.
we
again
have
a
great
body
of--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
and
under
certain
circumstances,
eligibility
for
induction
continues
well
past
the
age
of
26.
the
important
thing
is,
here
we
focus
on
registration.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
no,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons
i
don't
think
an
age
discrimination
case
would
have
been
appropriate.
first,
the
age
discrimination
standard
is
clearly
the
lowest
standard.
and,
more
importantly,
there
are
a
great
number
of
reasons
consistent
with
the
statute,
particularly
the
maintenance
of
a
strong
economy
and
to
minimize
as
equitable,
fair,
disruption
of
life
that
would
be
supported
by
limiting
the
exposure
and...
here
again,
we're
talking
of
exposure
of
induction.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
and
that's
what
i'm
saying,
that--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--and
to
the
extent
that
they
generally
have
continued
service
obligations
and
so
are
within
the
reach
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
well,
to
start
with,
the
policy
decision
to
exclude
women
which
was
made
in
1948
was
not
a
considered
decision
at
all.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
testimony
as
to
what
a
suitable
age
for
exposure
to
service
would
be.
there
was
no
such
consideration
of
including
or
excluding
women
using
traditional
statutory
interpretation
methods,
the
contemporaneous
statutory
history
before
the
same
committees,
the
same
congress,
at
the
same
time,
the
women's
armed
service
integration
act,
i
think
was
quite
fairly
characterized
by
the
district
court
as
having
been
passed
in
an
atmosphere
permeated
with
chauvinism.
there
were...
the
only
testimony--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--where
the
atmosphere
is
shown
in
specific
testimony,
in
specific
statements.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
i
think
that
in
the
arlington
heights
case
where
the
question
came
up,
starting,
if
it's
not
clear
on
its
face,
we
then
look
for
congressional
intent,
indeed,
in
this
very
statute
on
the
amendment
that
was
considered
in
o'brien,
where
you
looked
to
whether
there
was
any
evidence
of
an
improper
intent.
now,
in
that
case,
of
course,
you
found
that
there
was
none.
in
the
case
that's
before
you
today,
the
clear
testimony
and
the
clear
statements
before
congress
in
1948
to
the
effect
that,
well,
no
one
would
want
a
wave
officer
commanding
him,
that
the
men
would
object
to
being
under
the
command
of
women,
that
women
would
get
married
and
so
never
qualify
for
pensions;
the
entire
atmosphere...
and,
perhaps
atmosphere
was
the
wrong
word
for
the
district
court
to
use.
but
the
record
is
clear
that
there
was
nothing
beyond
stereotypical
consideration.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
yes,
i
believe
you
can.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
particularly,
because
the
defense
for
the
statute
even
under
the
rational
relationship
test
is
the
military
flexibility
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
has
described
and
because
that
argument
simply
does
not
relate
in
any
rational
way
to
either
the
facts
or
the
intent
of
the
statute,
the
function
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
well,
in
fact,
there
is
no
substantial
basis
in
the
record
for
believing
that
we
can
with
confidence
predict
that
we
will
be--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--yes.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
in
the
record.
we
have
history,
to
start
with,
that--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--the
record
before
the
trial
court
and
the
record
before
congress.
there
was
great
overlap
between
the
two.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
if
it
could
be
stated
that
we
can
safely
predict
that
there
would
not
arise
a
situation
where
volunteers
would
be
inadequate,
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
but
that's
not
what
we
face
with
registration.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
yes,
if
we
had
a
guarantee,
yes,
is
really
would
not
be
needed;
the
answer
is
yes.
and
that
goes,
i
think,
to
the
very
distinction
between
registration,
which
is
insurance
against
failing
to
have
volunteers
and
providing
against
the
broad
range
of
unpredictable
futures
which
do
confront
us,
and
conscription,
which
is
the
decision
when
one
of
those
futures
becomes
our
present,
to
say,
these
are
what
our
needs
are.
we
either
have
or
don't
have
enough
volunteers;
we
need
to
draft
for
certain
positions.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
first
of
all,
this
court,
although
often
asked
to,
has
never
accepted
a
military
relationship
or
national
defense
exception
to
normal
standards
of
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
parker,
like
glines
and
huff,
and
greer
v.
spock,
are
so-called
military
enclave
cases,
and
they
all
go
off
on
parker
v.
levy's
language
about
the
military
being
a
separate
society
unto
itself
internally
requiring
for
matters
of
discipline
and
base
morale
a
separate
standard.
this
statute--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--that's
within
a
military
enclave.
this
is
not
a
military
enclave
case,
this
is
more
like
snepp.
indeed,
i
think
that's
the
only
situation
where
this
particular
act
has
been
brought
into
question.
and
there
the
court
required
the
government
to
show
that
the
distinction
drawn
was
strictly
justified
by
a
substantial
governmental
interest
in
waiting
for
it.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
with
schlesinger
v.
ballard,
there
are
a
number
of
distinguishing
characteristics--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
that
was
most
directly
within
the
military.
it
was
an
internal
matter
to
the
military
where
it
was
promotion
geared
to
the
military's
express
desire
for
the
proper
pyramid
of
promotions.
frontiero
was
also
internal
to
the
military.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
in
frontiero
the
holding,
i
believe,
was
that
the
distinction
drawn--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--it
was
within
the
military,
but
because
the
distinction
drawn
was
based
on
stereotype,
it
failed
the
heightened
scrutiny.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
heightened
scrutiny.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
definitely
not
the
rational
relationship.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
there
was
a
plurality
opinion
in
frontiero--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--the
fifth
vote
was
based
on...
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
fifth
vote
was
based
upon
an
application
of
a
test
that
went
far
beyond
rational
basis.
it
was
in
effect,
i
think,
a
heightened--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--it
was
reed;
exactly.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
it's
a
heightened
scrutiny
but--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--as
it
applies
to
gender,
which
was
a
close
and
substantial
relationship.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
it
looks
for
a
substantial
relationship,
and
that,
i
think,
craig
v.
boren
says
that's
what
reed
says.
schlesinger's
important,
really
for
the
ways
in
which
it
differs
from
this
case.
every
case,
i
think,
in
this
court
that
has
ever
cited
schlesinger,
and
has
purported
to
follow
schlesinger,
has
emphasized
that
schlesinger
was
a
compensatory
ameliatory
act,
that
in
fact
it
was
uniquely
so,
because
the
very
men
who
brought
that
action
were
the
precise
men
who
had
benefited
from
the
assignment
differential,
which
means
access
to
promotion
differential,
and
so
that
case
really
is
perhaps
the
archetype
of
compensatory--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--like
kahn
and
shevin.
it
is
usually
cited
seriatim
to
kahn
and
shevin.
the
other
thing
is,
of
course,
schlesinger
was
an
internal
military
case,
and
most
importantly,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
differentiating
it
between
this
case,
other
than
the
internal
military
matter,
is
that
the
basis
of
classification
was
not
simply
gender.
the
explicit
basis
of
classification
was
gender
except
where
the
access
to
the
promotions
was
equal,
at
which
point
there
was
no
differentiation.
this
court
emphasized
it,
i
think,
at
least
three
times
in
schlesinger,
that
where
men
and
women,
for
instance,
in
the
medical
corps
or
the
legal
corps...
several
other
corps...
had
equal
access
to
assignments
geared
to
foster
promotions,
there
was
no
difference
in
the
time
permitted
to
achieve
promotion.
and
that,
i
think,
is
very,
very
important.
the
other
thing
is
that
historically
schlesinger
was
not
based,
even
arguably,
on
stereotypes.
it
was
demonstrably
based
upon
a
recent
congressional
reconsideration
in
1967,
in
fact,
of
precisely
what
was
going
on.
they
found
that
there
was
still
a
gap
in
assignability,
and
there
was
still
a
gap,
most
particularly
in
how
long
it
was
taking
men
and
women
to
achieve
promotions.
and
so
congress
there
did
reenact,
literally,
as
opposed
to
what
happened
here,
major
provisions
of
that
entire
series
of
statutes,
so
there
really
was
congressional
consideration
there.
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
the
only
one
that
didn't
come
up,
actually,
in
the
questioning
is
that
in
order
to
justify
male-only
registration,
the
burden
of
the
appellant
at
trial
and
to
prove
that
it
was
accomplished
at
trial
here,
was
to
prove
a
need
to
exclude
women
from
registration.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
except
where
that
act
draws
some
form
of
discriminatory--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--if
it
was
an
assignment
that--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--i
think
not,
as
this
court
said
as
recently
as--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--there's
no
question
of
the
power--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--i
would
go
one
step
further,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
when
a
legislature,
including
congress,
enacts
a
statute
based
upon
gender
and
the
distinction
of
gender
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is
based
upon
gender,
it
is
the
burden
of
those
defending
the
statute
to
come
forth
and
establish
by
empirical
evidence,
in
fact--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--but,
your
honor,
once
the
attack
shows
that
it
was
gender-based
discrimination,
this
court--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--your
honor,
that
would
affect
registration
only
if
two
different
statutes
were
involved,
one,
a
statutory
prohibition
on
women
participating
in
certain
close
combat
activities,
and
the
other,
more
importantly,
a
change
in
the
military
selective
service
act
limiting
the
induction
of
people
to
people
who
will
be
assigned
to
those
prohibited
roles,
because
otherwise
we
are
conflicting
with
history
and
congress
did
not
mean
to
conflict
with
history
because
we
have
always,
as
the
testimony
of
general
tice
and
all
the
generals
is
clear,
we
have
always
drafted
a
very
substantial,
indeed,
often
a
majority
of
draftees
specifically
for
the
noncombat
areas.
and
most
importantly,
the
argument
of
flexibility
was
specifically
refuted
by
general
abrams
and
other
generals
in
the
testimony
because
we
are
saying
that
there
is
a
certain
number
of
women
that
the
military
wants
to
have,
welcomes,
thinks
is
the
optimal
number
for
the
defense
of
the
country.
you
cannot
at
the
one
point
say
that
that
is
the
military
opinion
and
at
the
same
time
say
that
if
those
slots
are
filled
with
draftees
rather
than
volunteers,
we
undermine
flexibility.
the
testimony
of
every
defense
department
witness
and
every
military
witness
was
that
all
of
those
criteria,
the
reach-back,
the
flexibility,
the
rotation,
the
promotion
rotations,
the
assignment
rotation,
were
all
taken
fully
into
account
when
the
military
said,
please
let
us
register
women,
and
let
us
decide
whether
they
should
be
drafted,
if
and
when
the
time
for
a
draft
comes.
general
abrams
said
that
he
didn't
favor
drafting
women
at
the
time
because
he
didn't
favor
drafting
men
at
the
time.
they
were
in
an
all-volunteer
mode,
as
he
said,
and
that
since
present
needs
for
both
men
and
women
were
being
met
with
volunteers,
he
didn't
favor
drafting
anybody
at
that
time.
secretary
brown
kept
saying
to
congress,
let
us
register
people
now;
and
then,
when
we
see
what
the
need
is,
we
can
draft
them.
this
was
what
we
came
within
a
hair's-breadth
of
doing
in
world
war
ii
with
respect
to
nurses.
i
would
only
point
that
the
utilization
question
is
contrary
to
what
the
government
says.
for
example,
ministers
are
required--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--it
would
be
a
different
matter
of
somehow
meeting
an
evidentiary
burden.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
they
didn't.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
general
eisenhower's
statement
to
the
congress
in
1948
was,
if
we
ever
have
another
war,
we
have
got
to
draft
women.
and
that
was
based
upon
their
performance
even
in
the
more
limited
numbers
and
roles
that
were
used
in
world
war
ii.
i
would
point
out
that--
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
--yes,
i
think
the
district
court
specifically
rejected
a
number
of
them.
mr.
donald
l.
weinberg
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
read
that.
the
treatment
of
what
happened
in
1980
as
congressional
action
was...
the
conference
report
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
include
women.
it
did
not
find
an
affirmative
need
to
exclude
women:
again,
congress
was
dealing,
i
think,
with
the
wrong
question
in
that
respect.
more
importantly,
perhaps,
the
activity
of
congress
in
1980
was
not
a
reenactment
or
reconsideration
of
this
situation.
the
appropriations
aspect
of
it,
the
house
joint
resolution,
didn't
even
mention
the
word
"registration".
it
was
a
transfer
of
otherwise
unobligated
funds
from
the
air
force
to
selective
service
for
the
purpose
of
salaries
and
expenses.
i
think
ex
parte
endo
with
its
requirement
for
explicit
mention
of
a
particular
expenditure
rationale
says
that
that
would
not
suffice.
now,
with
respect
to
s.
2294,
the
authorizations
act,
again--
