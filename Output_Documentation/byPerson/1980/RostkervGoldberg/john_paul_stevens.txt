because
it's
always
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
matter
what
test
you
apply,
it
will
always
fall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
it
not
true
that
your
entire
argument
assumes
that
that
decision
is
a
constitutional
decision,
to
keep
women
out
of
combat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
interest
do
your
clients
have
in
having
women
registered
if
there
are
none
of
them
going
to
be
drafted?
it
seems
here
there's
no
interest
whatsoever
in
just
pure
registration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
must
assume
that
some
of
them
will
be
drafted
or
there's
nothing
worth
fighting
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore
there
is
a
connection
between
registration
and
drafting,
so
your
first
proposition
is
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
that
the
government
may
draft
in
unequal
numbers,
that
they
could
set
quotas
that
75
percent
of
the
draftees
will
be
male
and
25
percent
will
be
female?
do
you
concede
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
concede
that
there
are
different
military
needs
for
men
and
for
women?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
today?
they
need
650,000
men
and
80,000
women.
is
that
a
legitimate
constitutional
difference
in
need?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
concede
that
a
differential
induction
would
be
constitutionally
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
only
talking
about
registration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
from
what
you
suggest,
you
might
as
well
register
everybody
over
26
and
get
a
much
larger
pool
to
draw
from.
there
are
a
lot
of
retirees,
for
example,
who
can
perform
noncombatant
service
very
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
weinberg,
before
you...
i
see
your
light
was
gone
on...
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
be
interested
in
hearing
what
the
other
three
of
the
four
points
are
that
were
controlling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
the
burden
shift
as
soon
as
the
government
does...
and
you've
conceded
they've
done
here...
show
there's
a
difference
in
military
need
based
on
sex?
you
conceded
that's
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
just
ask
if
the
case
would
be
different
in
constitutional
terms
if
the
military
had
taken
the
position,
we
don't
like
women,
we
don't
want
any
of
them
in
the
army?
would
it
be
a
different
constitutional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
they
might
have
said
in
1948,
by
the
way.
