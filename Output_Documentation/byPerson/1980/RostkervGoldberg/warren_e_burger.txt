chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
used
the
term,
"reactivated".
when
that
original
action
in
the
three-judge
district
court
was
brought
in
'71...
was
it?
1971?
was
the
statute
we're
now
concerned
with
in
the
pleadings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
have
no
problem
about
the
action
being
the
proper
vehicle
for
the
issues
that
are
not
here?
chief
justice
burger
and
you
say
that
would
not
be
legitimate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
anything
in
article
i,
section
8,
that
limits
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
just
in
time
of
war?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
supposing...
i
suppose
you
could
concede
that
this
was
an
unwise
statute
that
congress
made
the
wrong
decision
in
the
circumstance
but
that
doesn't
make
it
unconstitutional,
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
admiral
hayward
and
general
wilson
both
testify
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
nothing
unusual
about
the
congress
not
agreeing
with
the
executive
branch
on
a
particular
issue,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
supported...
that
was
supported,
i
repeat,
by
the
testimony
of
admiral
hayward
and
general
wilson,
the
commandant
of
the
marine
corps
that
they
could
get
all
they
needed
on
volunteer
service.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weinberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
weinberg,
up
to
now
your
arguments,
at
least
as
i
follow
it,
is
that
there
were
better
ways
to
do
it
than
congress
did,
there
were
more
logical
ways,
but,
does
that
make
it,
the
failure
to
do
that,
does
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
got
that
far
yet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
a
lot
of
former
servicemen
are
over
26--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
the
policy
question
involved
in
fixing
the
ages
and
the
policy
question
made
at
this
stage
for
limited
purposes
of
excluding
women?
aren't
they
equally
policy
decisions
by
congress,
whether
wise
or
unwise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
when
is
it
the
function
of
the
courts
to
inquire
into
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
legislative
branch
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
a
case
of
our
court,
this
court,
that...
do
you
suggest
that
that's
a
proper
criterion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
read
the
testimony
as
well
as
the
district
judge
could
read
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you're
going
beyond
justice
powell's
question
now.
your
time
has
expired,
unless
justice
powell
wishes
to?
yes,
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted,
gentlemen.
thank
you
very
much.
