except,
i
suppose,
that
people
who
are
in
certain
classifications
might
be
assigned
outside
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor,
how
did
congress
make
that
decision?
currently?
perhaps
they
did
when
they
passed
the
law
originally?
they
refused
to
change
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
have
taken
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
a
proposal
that
failed
to
come
out
of
committee
or
was
voted
down
on
the
floor
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
ever
get
on
the
floor?
was
it
ever
voted
down,
actually?
was
it
just
a
committee
failing
to
report
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
not
so-called
congressional
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
they
shifted
funds
for
the
registration
of
males.
but
there's
nothing
in
that
resolution
which
indicates
what
congress
thought
about
these
factors.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
conference
report
was
adopted
by
both
houses?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
military
testify
against
the
registration
of
women?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
the
question
is
registration,
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
people
who
testified
must
have
thought
they
could
be
separated,
because
they
testified
in
favor
of
registration.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
can
be
separated?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
registration
means
mobilization
of
women,
or
that
it
just
means
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
initially
military
people
testified
in
favor
of,
defense
department
representatives
testified
in
favor
of
registering
women.
did
they
change
their
mind,
or
was
that
their
consistent
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
from
a
military
standpoint
there
was
not
only
no
objection
to
registering
women
but
they
supported
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
but
nevertheless,
congress
overruled
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
an
adequate
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question
be
that
you
need
them
in
the
military
but
you
don't
need
to
register
them?
justice
white
well,
we
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
that
is
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
it's
just
a
rational
relationship,
i
would
think
if
you,
unless
you
disbelieve
that
you
could
get
as
many
women
as
you
wanted,
or
that
were
needed,
on
a
voluntary
basis,
it
would
be
quite
rational
to
decide
not
to
go
through
the
entire
rigamarole
of
registration
and
the
drafting
of
women
just
to
get
the
ones
you
could
get
without
any
expense
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
read
the
record
different
than
you
did
and
then
thought
that
there
was
not
only
ample
basis
in
the
record
but
a
finding,
and
evidence,
that
you
can
get
the
women
without
registration?
what
then,
under
the
rational
relationship
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
would
that
satisfy
the
rational
relationship
test?
justice
white
what
was
the
holding
in
frontiero?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
in
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
failed
heightened
scrutiny?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
rational
relationship?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
fifth
vote
based
on?
