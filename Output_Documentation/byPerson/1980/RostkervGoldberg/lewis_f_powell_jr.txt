justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
mccree,
solicitor
general,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
conference
report
explicitly
approved
the
findings
by
the
senate
armed
services
committee,
on
page
100
of
the
conference
report
on
the
defense
department
authorization
act.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
at
this
point
and
ask,
is
it
not
possible
that
your
next
suit,
if
you
win
this
one,
and
if
women
were
not
drafted
on
an
equal
basis
with
men,
would
not
the
same
men
who
are
complaining
here
today
bring
suit
on
that
basis?
if
not,
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
inconsistent
in
what
way?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
register
them
equally.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
weinberg,
you
have
emphasized
the
testimony
and
i
quite
agree
with
you,
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would,
of
some
of
the
military
men.
i
think
you
can
find
conflicting
statements
if
you
read
in
all.
but
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
this.
the
armed
services
committee
of
the
united
states
senate
by
a
vote
of
twelve
to
five
reached
an
entirely
different
result
from
the
one
that
you
reached,
and
they
heard
the
testimony,
not
only
this
year
but
they've
been
hearing
it
for
years.
now,
did
the
district
court
reject
specifically
a
single
one
of
the
11
findings
made
by
the
senate
armed
services
committee
that
were
in
turn
approved
by
the
conferees
of
both
houses
and
in
turn
by
both
houses
of
congress?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
eleven?
if
so,
do
we
accept
the
rejection
by
the
district
court
that
tried
a
lawsuit
that
were
contrary
to
the
findings
of
the
united
states
congress?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
if
so
what
authority
justifies
us
in
doing
that?
