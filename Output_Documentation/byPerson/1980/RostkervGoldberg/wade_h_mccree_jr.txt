mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
military
selective
service
act
by
providing
for
a
male-only
registration
and
classification
for
possible
induction
into
the
armed
services
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
invidiously
discriminating
against
males.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
determining
that
the
male-only
registration
provision
of
the
military
selective
service
act
offends
the
constitution
and
enjoining
proceedings
pursuant
to
that
act.
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
about
the
facts
giving
rise
to
this
controversy.
since
1948
the
military
selective
service
act
has
provided
for
the
registration
of
males
between
the
ages
of
18
and
26
and
their
classification
and
induction
into
the
armed
services.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
all
male
citizens
and
all
male
resident
aliens;
only
aliens
not
in
non-immigrant
status.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
all
of
them
register,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
classification
system
provides
for
exemptions
and
deferments.
this
condition
continued
until
1973
when
the
congress
decided
to
experiment
with
an
all-volunteer
army
and
the
conscription
provision
of
the
statute
was
removed.
however,
the
registration
and
classification
provisions
continued,
as
they
do
today,
in
effect.
but
in
1975
the
president
decided
to
discontinue
the
classification
of
persons
under
the
military
selective
service
act
and
this
was
the
condition
until
1980
when
the
president
of
the
united
states
sent
a
message
to
the
congress
indicating
his
desire
because
of
foreign
policy
and
military
exigencies
to
reactivate
the
registration
procedures
and
he
also
requested
them
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
requirements
for
registration
and
classification
to
include
females.
the
three-judge
case
which
was--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it
is
not.
it
doesn't
forbid
the
list
for
any
purposes
other
than
that
the
stated
purposes,
but
it
states
the
purpose
for
which
it
would
be
used.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
may--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--if
you're
inquiring
for
service
other
than
within
the
armed
services,
my
understanding
is
that
it
does
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
for
induction
into
the
military
services.
it's
not
a
universal
service
act,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
was
certainly
done
under
the
act
and
i
assume
it
was
done
lawfully.
noncombatant
service,
within
the
service,
and
other
service
related
to
the
national
welfare,
i
think,
was
the
rubric
that
was
used
during
world
war
ii,
the
korean
war,
and
the
southeast
asian
hostilities.
the
president
requested
the
congress
to
shift
funds
from
the
department
of
defense
to
the
inactive
selective
service
machinery
to
reactivate
it,
to
commence
the
registration
of
males
and
females,
as
he
requested,
under
this
message
that
he
sent.
the
congress
considered
the
message
and
by
joint
resolution
transferred
funds
from
the
department
of
the
defense
to
the
selective
service
agency
to
permit
it
to
function,
but
denied
the
request
to
expand
the
selective
service
requirement
to
have
women
register.
the
three-judge
case
which
had
been
commenced
earlier
in
philadelphia
was
then
reactivated
and
the
court
determined
that
by
reason
of
the
non-inclusion
of
women
that
there
was
an
invidious
discrimination
against
males,
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
offended
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
enjoined
further
classification.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
statute
was
still
in
effect
but
in
1975
the
president
discontinued
registration
under
the
statute,
so
the
statute
still
authorized
the
president
by
proclamation
to
reinstitute
registration.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
do
not
raise
this
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
we
don't
raise
it
now.
we
believe
the
matter
is
properly
before
the
court
and
we
certainly
would
rather
have
the
court
adjudicate
it
now
than
to
wait
until
a
genuine
emergency
with
an
injunction
preventing
the
president
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
country.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
authorizes
him
by
proclamation.
it
does--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--he
did
issue
a
proclamation
requiring
young
men
who
were
born
in
1960
and
1961
to
register
and
then
on
a
continuing
basis
persons
who
were
born
after
january
1,
1963,
on
or
before
the
30
days
prior
to
their
18th
birthday.
and
that
is
continuing
now
under
a
stay
granted
by
this
court
following
our
appeal
from
the
determination
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
were
they
amended
in
the
court
below,
mr.
justice?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes.
the
pleadings
were
and
parties
were
added
because
some
of
the
original
parties
were
beyond
the
registration
limit
at
that
time,
the
26
age.
persons
were
added
so
that
there
was
an
appropriate
class
of
persons
who
were
subject
to
the
requirement
of
registration.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
aimed
at
the
old
statute
because
the
statute
wasn't
changed
to
require
the
registration
of
women,
and
it's
still
a
male-only
registration
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
what's
before
the
court
at
this
time,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
against
men.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
clear.
it
was
a
determination
and
in
fact
a
challenge
was
not
made
that
it
invidiously
discriminated
against
women.
other
grounds
were
asserted
that
the
court
didn't
pass
on.
they
asserted
that
it
took
property
without
due
process
of
law,
that
it
violated
the
prohibition
against
involuntary
servitude.
but
those
contentions
were
found
to
be
insufficient
and
only
on
the
invidious
discrimination
against
males
was
the
statute
held
invalid.
the
court
below
employed
what
this
court
has
called
in
some
of
its
decisions
an
intermediate
level
of
scrutiny
that
required
that
the
draft
registration
be
substantially
related
to
an
important
governmental
objective.
and
the
court
below
determined
that
the
findings
of
the
congress
on
the
question
of
military
need
did
not
show
an
important
governmental
objective
or
substantial
relation
thereto,
and
made
a
very
extended
examination
of
what
it
regarded
the
showing
that
the
government
had
made.
we
contend
essentially
two
things
here.
first
we
assert
that
because
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
a
power
expressly
granted
to
the
congress
by
the
constitution,
article
i,
section
8,
to
raise
an
army,
that
the
court
should
apply
the
rational
relationship
standard
in
determining
this
validity.
we
submit
that
raising
an
army
and
conducting
war
is
sui
generis.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
we
would
take
that.
i
think
we
might
do
that,
but
we
would
say--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--but
we
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
rationally
related
to
an
important
governmental
objective,
because--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--a
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate...
the
court
is
correct...
a
legitimate
governmental
objective.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
we
would
say
that
would
not
be
a
legitimate
governmental--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--we
submit
that
it
would
and--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--and
not
racial.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
not
religious.
we
say
that
it
would
not
be
a
legitimate
governmental
objective.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
believe
gender
base
is
related
to
a
legitimate
governmental
relationship
for
the
reason
that--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--no,
not
only
gender
base,
but
we
just
say
the
gender
base
would
satisfy
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh,
i
think
i
follow
the
court's
question.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
look
at
the
court's
question
in
this
way.
historically,
and
in
the
interpretations
by
this
court,
race
is
no
longer
an
appropriate
classification
for
the
disparate
treatment
of
anybody
in
this
country
anymore.
and
i
think,
if
i
can
say
anything
that
i
believe
categorically,
that's
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
always
irrational.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
wouldn't
pass
the
first
level
of
scrutiny.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
we
think
that
this
matter
should
be
determined
in
the
first
level
of
scrutiny,
as
i
suggested,
because
of
the
sui
generis
nature
of
raising
an
army
to
prepare
for
war.
the
congress
is
full
of
references
to
this,
and
of
course,
article
i,
section
8,
specifically
empowers
the
congress
to
raise
armies,
to
wage
war
and
make
rules
for
that
in--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
would
think
this
court
would
decide
korematsu
differently
today.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
korematsu
certainly
did.
hirabayashi,
was
that
the
other--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--the
other
one,
that
was
decided
with
it.
and
i
would
say
that
even
viewing
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
the
court
would
now,
as
applying,
it
would
decide
korematsu
differently.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
that's...
i
agree.
i
can't
argue
with
that.
i
certainly
can't
quarrel
with
that
assertion.
but
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
told
the...
the
constitution
tells
the
congress,
you
raise
the
armies,
you
make
rules
for
their
governance,
vest
in
them
an
authority
that
tells
the
courts
that
this
is
something
that
you
should
approach
with
great
deference
to
the
congressional
primacy
in
this
area.
there
are
many
other
areas
in
the
constitution,
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
that
point
up
this
special
circumstance.
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
for
example,
can
be
suspended
in
time
of
invasion.
and
the
9th
circuit
did
uphold
a
suspension
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
world
war
ii,
although
there
had
not
been
a
physical
invasion
of
the
hawaiian
islands;
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
this
case.
but
it's
some
evidence
of
what
the
constitution
intended
the
relationship
of
the
court
and
the
congress
and
the
executive
branch
to
be
in
this
extraordinary
circumstance
of
waging
war
or
preparing
to
wage
war.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
limitation.
it's
an
authorization
just
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
and
naval
forces.
it
doesn't
restrict
it
to
time
of
war
at
all,
and
it
tells,
as
we
respectfully
submit,
it
tells
the
courts
that
this
is
a
matter
where
great
deference
should
be
paid
to
congressional
determination.
and
the
congress
determined
in
this
case
that
in
the
event
of
a
mobilization
what
would
be
necessary
would
be
raising
an
effective
army
expeditiously.
and
to
do
this
it
would
require
flexibility.
and
the
flexibility
that
it
would
be
afforded
as
the
record
clearly
establishes
is
to
have
persons
who
could
perform
combatant
as
well
as
noncombatant
roles
in
the
armed
services.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
pleases.
there
is
evidence
before
the
court
that
although
women
can
perform
and
have
performed
and
still
do
perform
effectively
and
with
great
credit
in
noncombatant
roles
that
they
are
not
eligible
by
statute
and
policy
for
certain
roles
in
actual
close
combat
and
that
it
is--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
think
it
does,
because
at
this
time,
at
the
time
of
mobilization,
what
would
be
necessary
would
be
persons
who
could
be
rotated
among
all
of
the
military
roles
that
might
be
required,
and
although
women
could
perform
and
do
perform
and
have
performed
efficiently
in
the
noncombatant
roles,
they
couldn't
be
rotated,
and
flexibility
is
what
is
needed,
initially,
at
the
time
of
mobilization.
there
is
evidence
that
through
volunteer
activity
it
is
anticipated
that
a
sufficient
number
of
women
would
be
available
in
the
event
of
the
mobilization
that
was
projected
by
the
armed
services
witnesses
who
testified
here--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--no
one
challenges
it
in
this
litigation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
certainly
assert
that.
i
think
if
we
defer
to
the
congress
it
really
means
that
we
defer
to
the
right
to
be
wrong.
if
we
just
defer
to
them
when
we're
right,
it's
not
much
of...
it's
not
really
deferring.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that,
but
the
congress,
by
statute,
has
provided
that
women
are
not
eligible
to
perform
certain
functions
and
the
army
has
policies
that
they
shall
not,
too.
now,
the
fact
that
a
person
can
pilot
an
airplane
and
even
function
as
crew--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--and
some
men
who
cannot.
the
congress
can
make
this
kind
of
determination
if
it's
something
that's
peculiarly
committed
to
them
and
the
military
people
will
do
it
too.
the
problem
really--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--the
congress
refused
to
change
it--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--which
would
have
taken
legislation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
were
proposals
in
both
houses
and
on
pages
29
through
31
of
the
government's
brief
we
set
forth
in
the
margin
the
committee
action
where
this
was
considered
fully
and--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
believe
it
was
a
committee
failing
to
report
it
out,
but
i--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--no,
but
this
was
before
the
congress,
and
the
congress
did
enact
a
joint
resolution
shifting
funds--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--which
means
that
they
considered
this,
funds--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
appreciate
that
reference
and
i
would
suggest,
too,
that
senate
report
no.
96-826
on
page
159
also
adopts
the
committee
report
and
makes--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--by
both
houses.
and
it
makes
this
specific
finding
that
there
was
no
established
military
need
to
include
women
in
the
selective
service
system.
now,
we
don't
contend,
in
further
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
women
cannot
perform
a
wide
variety
of
roles,
but
the
military
has
made
this
determination
and
the
congress
has
made
this
determination
and
it
would
be
against
the
law
to
employ
them
in
certain
kinds
of
military
activity
at
this
time.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
assumes...
you
mean,
assumes
the
validity
of
the
statute--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that
excludes
them
from
this
purpose?
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
does,
but
that's
not
under
attack.
no
one
has
attacked
this
statute.
no
one
has
attacked
these
policies.
and
we
submit
further
that
it's...
we
should
defer,
the
court
should
defer
to
the
determination
of
the
military
in
a
matter
as
vital
as
this
at
this
time.
now,
it
may
be
that
they'll
expand
the
selective
service
at
another
time
when
it
appears
that
it
would
be
militarily
sound
to
do
this.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
military
initially
supported
the
registration
of
women--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--but
at
the
same
time
testified
that
they
would
not
be
inducted--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--for
the
purpose
of
mobilization.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
the
question
is
registration
but
registration
can't
be
divorced
from
classification
and
induction,
because
they
are
registered
to
be
eligible--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--but
they
also
testified
against
induction.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
they
can,
for
the
purposes
of
symbolism.
but
people
are
registered
in
order
to
establish
an
eligible
pool
of
persons
who
can
be
inducted.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
just
think
the
court
cannot
divorce
from
its
consideration
of
registration
the
purpose
for
which
it's
done.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
an
arbitrary
act
to
register--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--yes,
if
the
court
please.
but
their
needs
at
this
time
for
mobilization
are
for
persons
who
would
afford
them
the
maximum
flexibility,
who
even,
put
in
the
nursing
situation,
initially,
could
be
used
for
combat,
close
combat
situation,
if
required.
and
they
anticipated--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
can't
testify
about
vietnam.
i
know
something
about
world
war
ii,
and
i
know
that
the
attrition
was
always
at
the
front.
you
might
have,
say,
100
percent
of
your
personnel
and
90
percent
may
be
support
and
ten
percent
is
actively
engaged,
but
your
turnover
is
in
the
ten
percent.
and
then
you
have
to
have
the
flexibility
to
move
other
people
in
there
in
times
of
emergencies.
for
example,
the
battle
of
the
bulge
at
the
ardennes,
where
cooks,
bakers,
everybody
who
could
carry
a
rifle
was
pressed
into
service,
those
are
roles
forbidden
today
by
statute
and
policy
to
women,
for
women
to
perform,
and
the
testimony
here
is
that
the
initial
needs
at
mobilization
would
be
for
persons
who
could
be
rotated
into
any
situation
where
there
may
be
a
military
need
and
all
we
are
arguing
here
is
that
the
all-male
registration
at
this
time
be
granted.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
those
are
the
figures
that
i
recall.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
he
thought
the
80,000
women
would
be
furnished
by
volunteer--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--this
was
their
experience
in
the
light
of
females
volunteering
for
the
service.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
congress
decided
against
them.
they
did
not...
no,
they
did
not
change
their
mind.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
except
their
testimony
has
to
be
understood
in
the
light
of
their
further
testimony
that
even
if
we
registered
them
that
we
would
not
induct
them.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
the
congress,
to
which
the
constitution
gave
the
authority
to
raise
an
army,
decided
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
that
they
would
like
to
register
women
but
they
would
not
induct
them,
decided
not
to
provide
for
the
registration
of
women
at
this
time.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
not
in
my
experience,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
believe
that
we
satisfied
craig
v.
boren.
we
believe
here
that
this
is
an
important
governmental
objective
to
raise
an
army
and
we
believe
that
registration
is
substantially
related
to
it,
and
registration
of
men
is,
in
the
light
of--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--oh,
i
don't
think
there
must
be
a
showing
that
women
would
cause
some
kind
of
problem.
i
think
we
have
to
show--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
don't
even
think
we'd
have
to
show
that
women
are
not
needed.
i
think
we'd
have
to
show
that
to
adopt
this
policy
would
create
a
greater
likelihood
of
achieving
the
important
objective,
than
the
rational
level
cases
that
it
would
be
somehow
related
to
achieving
that--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
appreciate
that
suggestion--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--just
one
other
thought,
if
i
may
have
just
one
moment.
the
congress
may
also
have
determined
that
to
process
women
registrants
at
this
time,
since
we're
talking
about
51
percent
of
the
population,
they'd
need
to
allocate
twice
as
many
resources
just
for
the
registration
and
classification,
and
if
they're
not
going
to
induct
at
this
time--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
think
it's
more
than
that.
it's
an
argument
of
talking
about
finite
resources
and
how
they
should
be
allocated.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
