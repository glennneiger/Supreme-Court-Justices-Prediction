justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
mccree,
may
i
ask,
is
the
statute
one
that
simply
authorizes
the
president
by
proclamation
to
require
registration
or
that
it
directs
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
after
this
1980
action
in
congress
he
did
issue
a
proclamation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
certain
truth
to
the
saying
that
civil
liberties
get
their
greatest
protection
after
the
war
is
over,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
am
i
right
in
my
assumption
that
no
one
challenges
the
statutory
provision
that
women
shall
not
be
sent
into
combat?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
veterans'
preference
acts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
veterans'
preference
acts
dating
from
previous
draft
acts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
you
don't
challenge
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
use
of
women
in
certain
combat
positions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
a
decision
in
your
favor
here
have
any
effect
on
navy
policies?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
challenge
here
the
freedom
of
assignment
in
the...
rather,
the
limitation
of
freedom
of
assignment
in
the
navy
or
the
air
force?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
challenge
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
not
necessarily
true
at
all.
when
you're
mustered
out
you're
generally
given
the
option
whether
to
remain
in
the
reserve
or
not,
and
i
at
least,
speaking
from
my
own
experience
in
the
second
world
war,
i
opted
for
just
getting
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
record
are
you
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
parker
v.
levy?
justice
rehnquist
and
we
said
there
that
the
constitutional
first
amendment
overbreadth
attack
that
was
available
in
the
nonmilitary
context
was
not
available
in
the
military
context.
justice
rehnquist
what
about
ballard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--reed
v.
reed
just
says
this
court
scrutinizes
cases
that
are
brought
before
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
the
kassel
opinion
handed
down
this
morning.
