justice
jr.
--might
i
ask,
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
the
registration
statute
explicit
as
to
the
permissible
uses
of
the
registration
lists?
justice
jr.
well,
what
i'm
getting
at,
of
course,
is,
may
the
registration
lists
be
used,
for
example,
to
staff
nonmilitary
jobs?
justice
jr.
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
during
the
war,
do
you
recall,
when
not
we,
but
our
allies
had
all
kinds
of
registration
lists
which
they
then
used
to
bring
women
into
war
industries.
justice
jr.
it
does
not.
justice
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
take
that
position
if
the
classification
was
one
that
was
racially
discriminatory,
based
on
the
authority
to
raise?
justice
jr.
if
it
was
decided,
it
said,
would
have
registered
only
negroes
and
no
whites?
justice
jr.
i
thought
a
rational
basis
test
doesn't
talk
about
an
important
government
objective.
legitimate,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
then
gender-based
discrimination
could
be
supported
as
related
to
a
legitimate
governmental
objective;
not
racial?
justice
jr.
how
about
religious?
only
jews
shall
be
registered.
justice
jr.
only
gender
base;
sex?
justice
jr.
what
i'm
thinking
of,
other
bases:
race,
religion.
--we've
always
talked
about--
justice
jr.
--we've
always
talked
about
something
more
than
the
rational
basis
aspect.
justice
jr.
i
take
it,
in
what
you
said
earlier
about
always
irrationality
in
the
case
of
racial
discrimination,
you're
suggesting
then
korematsu
has
been
overruled?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
there
wasn't
any
evidence,
or
was
there...
was
there
any
evidence
before
the
congress
that
registration
of
women
would
negatively
affect
the
military
capacity?
justice
jr.
well,
does
that
add
up
to
evidence
that
registration
of
women
who
surely
are
being
used
and
could
be
used
in
other
capacities
than
combat,
does
that
add
up
to
any
evidence
that
the
registration
of
women
in
and
of
itself
would
negatively
affect
it.
justice
jr.
and
we
know
some
men
who
cannot.
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
mr.
solicitor
general--
justice
jr.
--the
same
committee
report,
if
i
recall
it,
of
the
armed
services,
in
any
event,
also
made
a
finding,
didn't
it,
that
there
were,
grave
shortages
also
exist
for
army
surgeons
and
nurses?
and
might
not
induction
be
limited
to
registrants,
women
registrants
for
jobs
like
that?
justice
jr.
how
much
of
that
was
done
in
vietnam?
what
percentage
of...
do
you
have
any
statistic
of
what
the
percentage
was
of
those
who
went
to
vietnam
ever
actually
saw
combat?
justice
jr.
didn't
the
director
of
selective
service
testify
here
that
if
we
had
to
mount
an
effort
in
europe
we'd
need
650,000
males
and
80,000
women?
justice
jr.
well,
wasn't
that
in
support
of
the
idea
that
we
ought
to
register
women
so
that
we
can
get
that
80,000
even
in
a
period
of
mobilization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
rationality
test
is
applicable
here
but
some
heightened
test
like
craig
v.
boren...
your
time's
running
out...
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
say
there
has
to
be
the
heightened
scrutiny
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
"substantially
related",
is
that
because
of
some
finding
that
women
are
not
needed
in
the
military,
or
must
there
be
some
burden
that
the
registration
of
women
would
affirmatively
cause
some
kind
of
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
would
you
have
to
show
that
under
the
heightened
scrutiny
would
you
at
least
have
to
show
that
women
are
not
needed
in
the
military?
justice
jr.
isn't
that
just
an
argument
of
administrative
convenience?
justice
jr.
mr.
weinberg,
the
district
court's
analysis,
of
course,
was
in
the
context
of
the
heightened
scrutiny
test,
the
craig
v.
boren
test,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
suppose
we
don't
agree
that
was
correct,
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
government's
argument
that
in
any
event
what
ought
to
be
applied
here
is
the
rational
basis
test,
and
by
any
measure
that
that
test
is
satisfied?
justice
jr.
what's
this
go
to,
the
legitimacy
of
the
government
interest?
what?
justice
jr.
what
does
it
go
to?
the
legitimacy
of
the
governmental
interest?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
weinberg,
if
we
disagree
with
the
district
court
and
with
you
that
there
ought
to
be
a
heightened
scrutiny
standard
here
and
agree
with
the
government
that
that
it
should
just
be
the
rational
basis
test,
can
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
justice
jr.
how?
justice
jr.
well,
is
there
any
basis
for
our
believing
that
we
can't?
justice
jr.
in
the
record?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
weinberg,
finally,
why
isn't
the
rationality
test,
in
light
of
the
clauses
of
the
constitution
we're
dealing
with,
the
proper
test
here?
justice
jr.
what
about
schlesinger
v.
ballard?
justice
jr.
why
doesn't
reed
apply?
