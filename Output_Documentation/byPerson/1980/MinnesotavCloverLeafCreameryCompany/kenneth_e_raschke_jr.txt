mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
minnesota
is
here
today
asking
this
court
to
review
and
reverse
a
decision
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
which
struck
down
supposedly
on
equal
protection
grounds
a
minnesota
law
which
would
have
stopped
the
sale
at
retail
in
minnesota
of
milk
in
single-use
throwaway
bottles
which
are
made
100
percent
from
oil
and
natural
gas
resources.
in
reality,
however,
this
case
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
we
should
return
to
the
days
when
the
courts
under
the
banner
of
substantive
due
process
interposed
their
judgment
upon
the
legislature
in
terms
of
determining
the
wisdom
and
expediency
of
given
pieces
of
legislation
and
weighing
evidence
and
testimony
pro
and
con
to
determine
whether
a
particular
piece
of
legislation
will
best
do
the
job
set
out
for
it.
the
statute
in
question
was
proposed
by
the
minnesota
pollution
control
agency
and
passed
by
the
legislature
in
the
spring
of
1977
as
an
implementation
of
general
state
policy
and
additionally
as
a
reaction
to
a
specific
set
of
circumstances
which
were
then
existing
within
the
state.
in
general,
the
agency
and
the
legislature
recognized
the
ridiculous
waste
of
resources
and
energy,
and
particularly
fossil
fuels,
in
many
circumstances,
as
well
as
the
unnecessary
disposal
problems
which
had
been
created
by
the
proliferation
of
single-use
packaging
which
serves
no
other
purpose
but
convenience.
the
legislative
policy
was
to
discourage
such
packaging,
and
the
plastic
jug
here
in
issue
is
a
prime
example
of
that
type
of
a
package;
and
encourage
better
alternatives
where
they're
available,
in
this
case
alternatives
such
as
returnable
containers
either
in
plastic
or
glass,
which
have
a
long
history
in
the
milk
industry.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
do
i
personally
feel
they
were,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
this
bill
originally
was
introduced
in
the
form
of
banning
specifically
the
plastic
jug
in
reaction
to
a
then-pending
move
by
major
dairies
within
the
state
to
commit
a
lot
of
money
and
capital
expenditures
in
long-term
commitments
to
the
throwaway
plastic
jug.
at
one
point
in
time
there
was
an
amendment
proposed
that
would
have
banned
paper
but
it
passed
in
the
form
originally
introduced
banning
only
the
plastic
jug.
i
think
the
idea
was
to
wait
and
see
what
sort
of
effect
this
act
would
have
had.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
was
necessarily
at
all
political
in
the
sense
of
reacting
without
legitimate
policy
to
specific
pressure
groups.
i
think
it
was
clear
from
the
motives
of
the
agencies
that
supported
the
bill
as
well
as
many
of
the
statements
made
in
debate
that
the
idea
of
the
bill
was
to
stop
a
trend
that
the
legislature
and
the
agency
saw
as
harmful.
and
that
was
the
situation
in
which
we
were
committing
ourselves
to
going
down
the
road
of
throwaway
containers
which
would...
all
parties,
i
think,
here,
concede
that
it
was
not
the
best
environmental
alternative.
the
specific
situation
that
the
legislature
was
reacting
to,
as
i
indicated
in
my
prior
answer,
is
that
the
milk
industry,
major
dairies
within
the
state,
were
on
the
verge
of
spending
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
commitment
to
long-term
production
of
these
plastic
jugs,
and
the
machinery
necessary
to
produce
these
plastic
jugs
is
both
expensive
and
has
a
long
useful
life.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
production
within
the
state;
that's
true.
it
was
recognized
that
the
paper
container
is
not
the
environmental
ideal.
the
paper
container
became
common
during
the
<nineteen
sixties>
[=
1960s].
however,
it
was
further
recognized
that
to
permit
this
move
to
plastic
would
lock
us
into
a
situation
which
would
virtually
eliminate
any
chance
of
movement
to
environmentally
preferable
alternatives.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
there's
only
one
sort
of
paper
container
which
was
at
issue.
we
talk
primarily
about
the
gallon-size
container
because
the
plastic
is
only
sold
in
gallon-size,
and
the
data
and
the
studies
only
contained...
there
was
one
sort
of
paper
container.
the
act
was
never
permitted
to
take
effect
because
this
trial
was
commenced
in
the
fall
of
1977
before
the
1978
effective
date.
the
'78
trial
took
on
what
can
best
be
described
as
the
tone
of
the
legislative
hearing.
there
were
copious
amounts
of
data,
government
reports,
which
were
used...
the
same
reports
used
by
both
sides
in
supporting
their
positions.
opinions,
expert
and
non-expert
alike,
were
offered
on
the
question
of
whether
the
plastic
jug
is
the
single
worst
container
from
an
environmental
standpoint
or
merely
the
second-worst
container
possible
for
the
sale
of
milk.
speculation
and
ideas
were
offered
concerning
whether
the
milk
industry
would
or
would
not
have
a
greater
tendency
to
go
to
preferable
containers
with
or
without
the
plastic
jug.
and
when
it
was
over--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--during
the
last
three
years
while
this
case
was
in
litigation,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
i
don't
believe
the
record
reflects
that
at
all.
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
record
which
makes
reference.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
idea,
your
honor,
was
to
prevent
the
situation
in
which
the
industry
was
permitted
to
go
ahead
and
make
these
types
of
investments
and
then
later
complain
of
the
tremendous
impact
it
would
have
on
them
to
then
come
back
and
ban
either
the
plastic
or
the
paper.
i
don't
think
that
has
significance
in
viewing
the
rational
basis
of
the
legislature.
otherwise
any
attempt
of
this
sort
could
be
defeated
by
the
regulated
industry
running
out,
making
the
commitments,
and
by
defeating
themselves
in
attempting
to
defeat
the
legislative
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
there's
nothing
i'm
aware
of
in
the
public
record,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we're
doing,
or
what
may
be
happening
is
that
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
minnesota
as
well
as
perhaps
other
places
is
waiting
to
see
the
outcome
of
this
case,
and
to
see
whether
the
legislature
will
indeed
be
permitted
to
proceed
a
step
at
a
time.
a
look
at
the--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
goal
of
the
legislature,
your
honor,
is
to
proceed
a
step
at
a
time
beginning
with
the
least
intrusive
sort
of
regulation.
now,
this
statute--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--in...
well,
in
moving
in
the
direction
of
our
goal,
this
statute
has
never
been
permitted
to
take
effect.
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
the
salutary
sort
of
effect
that
we
hope
for
it.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
i
think
the
legislation--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--that
could
be
done,
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
a
point
of
constitutional
significance,
but--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--that's
perhaps--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--there
are
a
number
of
other
factors.
both
the
parties
here
that
have
been
selling
milk
in
plastic
containers
and
other
dairies,
most
other
dairies
in
the
state
of
minnesota,
are
selling
milk
in
paper
containers,
either
paper
containers
in
addition
to
plastic
or
paper
containers
themselves.
and
one
of
the
rational
reasons
why
the
legislature
could
well
have
chosen
to
first
halt
plastic
and
hope
for
some
voluntary
movement
towards
better
containers
is
that
if
you
pick
a
point
in
time
and
ban
both
plastic
and
the
paper
containers
at
the
same
time
you've
got
almost
every
dairy
in
minnesota
scrambling
to
convert.
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
for
the
legislature
to
take
the
point
of
view
that
we'll
stop
the
plastic
container,
which
is
the
single
greatest
competitive
enemy
to
better
containers.
the
record
shows
that
at
least
in
other
states
the
plastic
throwaway
jug
has
made
its
gains
at
the
expense
of
returnables.
one
party,
wells
dairy
from
iowa,
purchased
a
plant
which
was
producing
in
pouch-type
containers,
which
the
data
shows
are
environmentally
preferable,
and
discontinued
that
in
order
to
go
to
the
plastic.
so,
hopefully,
if
we
remove
the
greatest
single
competitive
enemy
to
more
environmentally
sound
containers,
there
may
be
some
voluntary
movement
in
that
area.
and
i
think
that's
a
judgment
that
the
legislature
is
entitled
to
make.
certainly
the
option
that
you
suggest
and
the
option
that
was
suggested
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court
would
more
quickly
accomplish
the
environmental
goal,
but
i
think
that
it's
at
the
expense
of
other
things.
i
think
the
past
decisions
of
this
court
in
many
cases
permits
the
legislature
to
choose
a
step
at
a
time
approach
if
it
feels
that
that
is
called
for
in
the
given
situation.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
you
may.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
problems,
many
problems,
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
i
think
the
problem
with
the
district
court
was
that
it
clearly
said
that
it
felt
it
was
its
job
to
review,
weigh,
and
balance
the
evidence,
because
the
district
court
saw
itself
as
the
initial
fact
finder.
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
first
of
all,
did
not
i
believe
adopt
the
finding
that
the
act
had
a
protectionist
motive.
i
think
the
supreme
court,
our
supreme
court
noted
at
a-35,
i
think
it
is,
in
the
appendix,
that
the
act
unquestionably
deals
with
a
proper
public
purpose,
thus
rejecting
the
theory
of
the
trial
court.
but
a
problem
that
our
supreme
court
shared
with
the
trial
court
is
that
they
tended
to
agree
that
the
trial
court
was
the
basic
fact
finder
rather
than
the
legislature.
so
it's
our
contention
that
based
on
opinions
of
this
court,
recently
reaffirmed
in
such
cases
as
exxon
v.
governor
of
maryland,
city
of
new
orleans
v.
dukes,
is
that
it
is
the
legislative
judgment
that
must
stand,
so
long
as
there's
any
rational
basis
to
support
it.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
85,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
a-5?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
oh,
petition
for
cert.
i
was
looking
at
the
appendix.
a-5?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
well,
our
supreme
court
did
not
reach
the
commerce
clause
issue
and
i
guess
i
read
that
particular
phrase
as
referring
to
what...
and
what
comes
after,
concerning--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
i
think
it's
directly
inconsistent,
and
i
don't
think
by
affirming,
by
saying
that
they
were
generally
affirming
the
trial
court's
standards
that
they
were
getting
to
that
point.
the
important
thing
is
that
our
court
after
having
said
this,
(a)
was
looking
at
its
function
as
reviewing
the
trial
court's
findings;
and
(b)
undertook
the
task
of
determining
which
of
admittedly
admissible
evidence
was
more
or
less
credible
than
others,
in
making
the
ultimate
conclusions
about
which
type
of
regulation
would
be
best
effective
and
what
the
court
felt
was
the
single
worst
container.
it's
clear
that
on
a
proper
form
of
analysis
that
the
act
must
stand.
first
of
all,
there
is
data
on
the
record
that
clearly
demonstrates
the
plastic
jug
is
an
environmentally
poor
container.
second,
there's
clear
data
on
the
record
which
shows
that
it's
the
greatest
waster
of
fossil
fuel
energy
and
will
take
up
the
most
space
in
landfills.
it's
the
greatest
competitive
barrier
to
better
containers.
we're
on
the
verge
of
a...
we're
on
the
verge
of
long-term
commitments
to
that.
if
we
add
the
competitive
advantage
together
with
these
long-term
commitments
and
the
incentive
to
produce
and
promote
the
throwaway
container
that
that
would
entail,
we
would
virtually
guarantee
no
movement
towards
the
goal
of
better
containers.
the
plaintiffs
here,
as
we've
been
discussing
previously,
have
sought
to
make
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--we
could
do
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
legitimate
legislative
choice,
but
what
we're
arguing
here
is
that
it
is
not
a
constitutionally
mandated
legislative
choice.
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
for
a
number
of
years
have
clearly
indicated
that
legislation
is
not
to
be
struck
down
because
it
proceeds
one
step
at
a
time,
and
goes
not
as
far
as
it
might
go
to
better
accomplish
the
goal.
and
city
of
new
orleans
v.
dukes,
was
the
latest
case
of
that
type.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
the
legislative--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--i
think
the
legislature
can
be
allowed
to
take
the
first
step
without
being
constitutionally
required
to
guarantee
when
that
second
step
will
occur.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
in
the
railway
express
case--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--in
the
railway
express
case
this
court
indicated
that
the
legislature
is
free
to
address
one
portion
of
the
problem
and
leave
other
portions
for
a
later
time.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
the
second
step
must
be
guaranteed
at
least--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
yes,
it
has.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
i
guess
the
legislature
ought
to
be
entitled
after
this
case
is
over
and
hopefully
this
court
would
reverse
the
minnesota
decision
and
allow
this
step
to
take
effect
to
see
how
less
restrictive,
less
onerous
regulations
work
before
we're
constitutionally
required
by
court
decree
to
take
the
most
intrusive
measure
in
accomplishing
the
goal.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
they
are.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
well,
we're
trying
to
stop
the
major
financial
commitments,
for
one
thing.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
we
are
not
aware
that
those
commitments
have
been
made.
i'm
not
aware,
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
those
investments
have
been
made.
we
know
that
there
is
sale
taking
place
in
plastic,
but
as
i
said
before,
if
we're
allowed
to
base
a
constitutional
decision
on
the
efforts
of
the
industry
to
defeat
the
goals,
no
regulation
of
that
type
can
stand.
we
can't
continue
indefinitely
using
up
valuable
energy
and
solid
waste
resources.
the
important
point
here
is
that
these
jugs
are
made
100
percent
from
fossil
fuel
energy,
when
there
are
viable
alternatives
that
can
be
used.
this--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--i've
granted
ten
minutes
to
mr.
dalton
of
the
solicitor's
office
and
if
he
has
any
time
left
i
would
like
to
rebut.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
just
a
couple
of
further
comments,
your
honor.
i
am
not
aware
that
the
minnesota
constitution
contains
anything
directly
parallel
to
the
u.s.
equal
protection
clause.
i
was
just
paging
through
to
find
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
at
a-8,
they
do
not
cite
any
state
constitutional
provision
to
base
their
equal
protection
argument
in
the
complaint.
secondly,
mr.
keyes
mentioned
that
plastic
burns
at
a
higher
btu
value.
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
that.
it
has
a
whole
lot
more
energy
locked
up
in
it.
the
trial
court
found
that
it
has
three
times,
roughly,
the
energy
that
the
paperboard
container
has
in
it.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
protecting
the
pulpwood
industry,
there's
no
evidence
on
record
that
demonstrates
that
these
paperboard
containers
actually
come
from
any
minnesota
paper
products
as
opposed
to
products
of
any
one
of
a
large
number
of
other
states
which
are
engaged
in
the
paper
industry.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
well,
i
don't...
if
you're
asking
me
whether
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
are
numerous
cases
involving
paper--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--i
think
that's
judicially
noticeable.
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
with
respect
to
discrimination...
paper?
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
the
act
makes
no
distinction
whatsoever
with
respect
to
where
the
containers,
raw
materials,
or
anything
else
came--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--the
state
supreme
court
found--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--with
respect
to--
mr.
kenneth
e.
raschke,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there
was
any
finding
with
respect
to
where
the
paper
for
the
paperboard
container
comes
from,
whether
within
or
without
the
state.
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
make
that
distinction.
certainly
the
statute
in
its
effects
in
its
entirety
placed
a
primary
impact
on
local
interests,
the
local
dairies
and
the
retailers
that
would
like
to
be
able
to
sell
this
milk.
it's
only
after
you
get
two
or
three
steps
removed
in
terms
of
regulation
that
we
even
get
the
plastic
industry,
who
makes
something
that
happens
to
go
into
one
use,
one
container.
i
thank
you.
