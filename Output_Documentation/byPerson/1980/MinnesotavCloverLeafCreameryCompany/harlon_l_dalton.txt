mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
propose
to
first
explain
the
federal
government's
interest
in
and
participation
in
this
case;
and
secondly,
to
capsulize
more
briefly
than
i
had
expected
where
the
minnesota
supreme
court
went
wrong.
and
then
i
will
turn
to
the
commerce
clause
issues
that
i
think
are
behind
mr.
justice
powell's
questions.
the
federal
interest
in
this
case
is
really
two-fold.
first,
we
wish
to
encourage
efforts
like
that
of
minnesota
to
conserve
nonrenewable
fossil
fuels.
the
recent
opinions
of
this
court
and
several
recent
enactments
of
the
congress
have
manifested
the
important
national
interest
in
conservation
of
nonrenewable
resources.
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
however,
in
our
view
took
insufficient
notice
of
this
statutory
purpose
and
concluded
that
the
use
of
oil
and
gas
in
plastic
containers,
plastic
milk
containers,
was
small
and
that
in
any
event
plastic
can
be
recycled.
therefore
there
was
no
need
to
give
serious
attention
to
the
problem
of
depletion
of
non-renewable
fuels.
the
problem
is
that
if
you
multiply
the
oil
and
gas
used
in
milk
cartons
in
minnesota
across
50
states,
a
cross-patching
not
only
for
milk
but
for
other
beverages
and
foodstuffs
and
over
time,
then
the
problem
may
indeed
be
substantial.
as
for
the
question
of
the
recycling
of
plastic,
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
plastic
container
in
minnesota
or
anywhere
else,
in
fact,
is
recycled
or
that
recycling
is
feasible.
the
legislature
certainly
could
have
concluded
to
the
contrary,
and
in
any
event,
even
if
recycling
of
plastic
was
a
way
of
reducing
the
dependence
on
non-renewable
fuels,
the
legislature
was
free
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
choice
to
select
another
alternative
for
dealing
with
the
problem
of
solid
waste
disposal
and
energy
misuse.
the
second
government
interest,
federal
governmental
interest
in
this
case,
is
in
solid
waste
disposal
generally
and
more
particularly
in
beverage
container
disposal.
there
are
a
series
of
federal
statutes
that
bear
upon
this
question,
most
particularly
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
1976.
a
federal
interagency
commission
convened
pursuant
to
that
statute
addressed
the
question
of
beverage
containers,
beverage
container
disposal,
contemplated
whether
or
not
to
pass
a
national
statute
and
decided
instead
to
look
to
the
states
and
see
what
the
states'
experience
would
be
in
various
methods
directed
to
beverage
container
disposal.
now,
that
proposal
was
directed
to
beer
and
soft
drink
containers
but
the
same
notion
of
using
the
states
as
a
laboratory
applies
with
equal
force
to
milk
containers.
indeed
not
only
is
it
in
the
federal
government's
interest
to
use
the
states'
experimentations
in
this
area
as
a
laboratory,
it's
in
the
interest
of
each
of
the
individual
states
including
minnesota
to
take
a
step
and
look
empirically
at
their
experience
and
then
take
the
next
step.
the
experience
of
vermont
in
this
respect,
we
find,
very
instructive,
and
that's
detailed
in
footnote
6
of
our
brief.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no,
i'm
saying
there's
a
federal
interest
in
leaving
minnesota
free
to
choose
paper
over
plastic,
and
then
in
seeing
whether
that
in
fact
does
advance
the
statutory
goals
of
the--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--i
think
the
federal
government
has
a
very
clear
preference
for
returnable
bottles.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
only
to
the
extent
that
plastic
does
use
nonrenewable
fossil
fuels.
to
that
extent.
assuming
the
paper
and
plastic--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--yes;
my
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
assuming
that
they
are?
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
assume
that
in
other
respects
they
are
environmentally
equally
destructive
or
harmful
or
nondestructive,
that
the
federal
government's
preference
for
conserving
fossil
fuels
would
make
plastic
preferable
over
paper.
we
have
not
made
an
independent
judgment
of
whether
in
fact
plastic
as
opposed
to
paper
is
more
environmentally
disruptive.
the
state
of
minnesota's
legislature
has
made
that
judgment--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--okay.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
in
that
case
the
answer
must
be,
yes,
given
the
federal
interest
in
conservation
of
fossil
fuels.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
we
would
have
an
interest
in
that
statute
because
we
have
an
interest
in
seeing
whether
that
process
is
an
appropriate
one
or
a
successful
one
in
leading
toward
the
ultimate
goal
of
returnable
containers.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
that
would
also
withstand
a
rational
scrutiny
test,
which
is
the
only
one
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
precisely.
i'd
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
question
of
pulp
and
the
fact
that
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record...
at
least,
statements
by
legislators...
that
this
bill
is
related
to
the
interests
of
the
timber
industry
in
minnesota.
first
off,
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
united
states
v.
o'brien
that
legislation
which
on
its
face
is
constitutional
ought
not
to
be
struck
down
because
some
legislators
have
made
statements
without
which
the
statute
would
survive.
secondly,
it's
not
a
sufficient
criticism
to
say
that
a
statute
is
in
part
politically
motivated.
legislatures
are
supposed
to
take
into
account
the
political,
that
is
the
economic
and
the
social
interests
of
their
citizens.
what
they
can't
do
is
to
place
burdens
on
interstate
commerce
that
violate
the
commerce
clause.
our
position
is
that
this
statute
does
not
do
that.
this
statute
is
not
protectionist
on
its
face.
there
are
statutory
purposes
which
are
set
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
this
statute
is
not
protectionist
in
effect.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
correct
in
noting
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
essentially
disavowed
the
district
court's
factual
finding
that
the
statute
had
a
protectionist
purpose.
nor
is
the
statute
protectionist
in
terms
of
the
means
that
are
chosen
to
effect
its
purposes,
as
was
the
case,
in
the
case
last
term,
lewis
v.
bt
investment,
the
florida
case
involving--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--no,
i'm
certainly
not
saying
that
by
simply
enunciating
what
legislative
purposes
that
seem
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause,
a
state
can
insulate
that
statute
from
commerce
clause
challenge.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
a
protectionist
purpose
and--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--but
our
position
is
that
the
supreme
court--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--again,
please?
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no,
on
the
contrary.
i
think
that
the
district
court
found
to
the
contrary
because
it
weighed
and
sifted
the
evidence,
because
it
took
the
wrong
approach,
in
essence.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
effect
of
the
statute,
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
out-of-state
paper
interests
from
producing
paper
cartons
and
marketing
them
in
minnesota.
it
doesn't
prohibit
in-state
minnesota
plastics
manufacturers
from
manufacturing
plastic
cartons
and
shipping
them
out
of
the
state.
there
is
no
barrier
to
interstate
commerce.
what
the
statute
does
is
prohibit
a
product,
not
the
product
manufactured
at
a
particular
location.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
my
understanding
is
that
there
were
not
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
enacted,
but
that
there
was
a
move
afoot
to
have
in-state
manufacturing
of
plastic
cartons.
that's
part
of
what
motivated
the
statute.
that's
part
of
the
capital
investment
to
which
mr.
raschke
referred
that
indeed
was
the
impetus
for
the
statute.
well,
i'll
cede
the
balance
of
my
time
back
to
the
petitioner.
