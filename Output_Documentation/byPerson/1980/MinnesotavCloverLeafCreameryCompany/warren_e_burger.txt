production

chief
justice
burger
are
the
paper-type
containers
divided
into
two
categories,
one
readily
destructible
and
the
other
not
so
readily
destructible?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
you
can't
take
the
next
step
until
this
case
is
resolved,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now.
you're
cutting
into
your
colleague's
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
dalton.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
the
premise
here
that
the
pulp
used
in
the
other
containers
is
a
renewable,
because
it's
a
fast
growth?
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
keyes.
chief
justice
burger
sooner
or
later,
mr.
keyes,
someone
must
dispose
of
the
container,
whatever
it
is,
must
they
not?
chief
justice
burger
it
may
even
take
about
four
drinks
but
it
is--
chief
justice
burger
--and
are
these
plastic
containers
combustible?
chief
justice
burger
no
one
knows
really
very
much
about
this
problem
as
yet,
do
we?
scientists,
environmentalists,
governments,
it's
really...
we're
going
into
a
fog
bank,
aren't
we,
to
a
large
extent?
chief
justice
burger
i
was
speaking
of
experience.
there's
very
little
experience
to
go
on,
isn't
that
true?

the
technology?
chief
justice
burger
what
out-of-state
industry
as
of
the
present
time,
or
at
the
time
of
beginning
of
the
litigation,
was
being
banned?
chief
justice
burger
generally?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
understood
the
state
to
say
that
they
were
going
to
set
up
a
plant
in
minnesota,
and
that
this
was
what
brought
up,
one
of
the
things
that
brought
up
the
legislation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
keyes.
mr.
raschke,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
a
couple
of
minutes
left.
chief
justice
burger
--well,
did
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
say
they
were
judicially
noticing
this
production
and
resource
factor?
did
its
opinion
mention
that?
chief
justice
burger
no,
did
they
refer
to
the
fact
that...
the
source
of
these
containers,
whether
they
were
made
inside
or
outside
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

thank
you,
