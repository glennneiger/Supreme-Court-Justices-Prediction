justice
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute?
justice
jr.
you
make
the
argument
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
decided
this
case
on
substantive
due
process
analysis,
and
i
would
certainly
agree
there's
a
good
deal
of
language
in
the
opinion
that
i
would
construe
that
way.
and
yet
i
also
read
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
saying
positively
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
despite
what
the
legislature
said,
was
discriminatory.
its
purpose
was
to
discriminate
against
the
plastic
industry,
not
represented
in
minnesota,
but
outside
of
that
state.
and
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court
were
found
by
the
supreme
court
on
an
independent
review
of
the
evidence
to
be
incorrect.
so
what
do
we
do
with
those
findings?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
what
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
said?
look
at
page
a-5
of
the
petition.
down
near
the
middle
of
the
paragraph
that
begins
on
the
middle
of
that
page.
justice
jr.
a-5,
the
third
sentence
in
the
paragraph
beginning,
"we
are
aware".
on
a-5?
justice
jr.
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
jr.
it's
the
paragraph
beginning,
"we
are
aware"?
justice
jr.
the
third
sentence:
"based
upon
the
relevant
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
supported
by
the
record,
and
upon
our
own
independent
review
of
documentary
sources,
we
believe
the
evidence
conclusively
demonstrates
that
the
discrimination
against
plastic
nonrefillables.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
pick
up
equal
protection
analysis
which
was
the
analysis
relied
upon
primarily
by
the
courts
below.
but
the
commerce
clause
issue
is
the
one
that
concerns
me,
and
i
think
that
language
by
the
supreme
court
can
be
read
as
confirming
the
finding
of
fact
with
respect
to
discrimination
made
by
the
trial
court,
unless
you
have
some
explanation
for
it
that
hasn't
occurred
to
me
at
the
moment.
justice
jr.
it's
been
three
years
now,
hasn't
it?
justice
jr.
you
are
not
saying,
i
am
sure,
that
the
legislative
purpose
would
prevent
any
factual
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
this
statute
really
was
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce,
are
you?
justice
jr.
well,
the
district
court
found
to
the
contrary.
justice
jr.
you
want
us
to
weigh
the
evidence?
justice
jr.
you
want
us
to
weigh
the
evidence?
justice
jr.
are
there
any
plastic
manufacturers
in
minnesota?
