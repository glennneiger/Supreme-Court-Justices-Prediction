mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
today
has
before
it
a
unique
minnesota
statute.
it's
a
criminal
act
that
hasn't
been
adopted
by
any
other
legislature
in
the
united
states.
it
affects
only
milk.
milk
cannot
be
packaged
or
sold
at
retail
in
minnesota
in
a
gallon,
plastic,
non-returnable
container.
it
does
not
affect
windshield
wiper
fluid
or
kerosene
or
any
other
liquid
substance.
it's
an
absolute
bar,
and
it
is
not
an
anti-littering
statute.
the
state
of
minnesota
has
been
referring
in
their
brief
to
throwaway
bottles.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
talks
about
the
anti-littering
statutes
which
have
been
held
constitutional
throughout
this
country.
this
is
not
an
anti-littering
statute
on
either
side.
nobody
drinks
milk
and
throws
the
bottle
out
the
window,
whether
it's
a
plastic
bottle
or
a
paperboard
bottle.
therefore,
the
question
is
simply--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--surely.
surely.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
they
don't
litter
it,
your
honor.
they
do
not
litter
the
container.
that's
our
position.
obviously,
it
has
to
be
disposed
of
some
way,
either
by
recycling,
by
combustion,
or
by
landfill,
are
the
basic--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--they
are
completely
combustible.
no
noxious
gases
of
any
kind,
completely
combustible
at
a
higher,
much
higher
btu
temperature
than
are
the
paperboard,
your
honor.
they
are
also
completely
recycleable,
and
contrary
to
the
solicitor
general's
statement,
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
in
the
trial
of
the
recycling
programs
which
are
in
practice
in
minnesota
right
now.
furthermore,
this
is
not
a
novel
product
for
minnesota--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--i
do
not
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
there
was
evidence
produced.
there
was
evidence
produced
which
the
court
found
preponderant,
rated
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
obviously
there
was
evidence
produced
at
the
trial;
that
was
what
the
trial
was
for.
there
was
also
evidence,
i'm
sure,
produced
before
legislative
hearings.
but
i
would
say
that
the
result
of
the
lower
minnesota
court's
decision,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
minnesota
court
understands
those
principles
on
which
it
must
decide
these
constitutional
issues,
found
that
the
plaintiffs
had
sustained
the
tremendous
burden
which
is
placed
upon
them
in
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
i
assure
you
that
we
would
not
be
here
if
it
had
said
no
plastic
or
no
paper
right
now.
five
years
from
now,
i
don't
know.
i
can
tell
you
this,
mr.
justice
white,
however,
that
at
the
trial
the
head
of
the
pollution
control
agency
in
minnesota
said
there
were
no
plans
whatsoever
by
that
agency
to
introduce
any
legislation
in
regard
to
any
other
type
of
milk
container.
we
also
had
a
witness
from
the
environmental
protection
agency
from
washington,
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
lower
court
in
minnesota,
who
testified
that
there
were
no
federal
statutes
or
regulations
contemplated
in
regard
to
regulating
plastic
containers.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
we
did
have,
of
course,
the
mri
report
which,
and
the
expert
witnesses
from
both
sides
who
testified
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
very
little
experience
in
this
type
of
statute,
your
honor,
yes.
and
also
i
would
agree
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--technology?
right.
because
we
talk
about
nonrenewable
resources
being
used
here
to
make
plastic.
plastic
can
be
made
out
of
anything
with
carbon
and
hydrogen.
it
can
be
made
out
of
air,
made
out
of
grass.
as
of
now
petrochemicals
are
being
used
because
they
used
to
be
burned
off,
not
flared
off.
they
never...
the
plastic
which
goes
into
the
polyethylene
is
not
a
component
of
the
heating
fuel
which
the
state
seems
to
indicate
we're
being
deprived
of
in
this
matter.
they
used
to
be
flared
off;
they're
now
being
used
in
this
country
for
petrochemicals.
the
minnesota
court
found
two
basic
factors.
one,
both
courts
found
there
was
no
rational
nexus
between
what
the
state
of
minnesota
said
it
wanted
to
accomplish,
that
is,
environmental
purpose,
and
the
means
selected
to
accomplish
it,
that
is,
banning
this
container
of
one
liquid.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
we
submit,
not
on
the
evidence.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
would
it
be
rationally--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--yes.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
well,
for
two
reasons
in
this
case.
one,
plastic
has
been
there
for
ten
or
twelve
years.
second,
the
second--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--all
right.
that
is,
that
the
trial
court
found
after
taking
voluminous
evidence
that
in
minnesota
there
would
be
no
return
to
returnables.
if
plastic
is
abandoned,
the
housewife
and
the
dairy
would
go
only
to
the
paperboard,
nonrefillable,
nonreturnable
container.
the
evidence...
that
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
upon
the
evidence
in
this
case.
so,
when
we're
talking
about
this
type
of
statute
promoting
refillables,
it
just
as
a
practical
matter
does
not
do
it.
furthermore,
the
department
of
agriculture
of
minnesota
is
opposed
to
refillables.
the
city
of
rochester
would
not
permit
refillables
because
of
the
fact
that
the
sewage
system
couldn't
stand
it
from
the
washing
at
the
home
and
the
washing
at
the
dairy.
there
was
much
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
yes,
it
is.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
that's
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
because
the
half
that
they
are
going
to
take
out
isn't
going
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
getting
refillables.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
not
necessarily,
when...
100
percent
of
the
consumers
would
then
go
to
the
paperboard,
as
the
evidence
showed.
you
wouldn't
get
refillables.
they
didn't
get
them
in
canada
in
ontario,
where
they
banned
both.
in
canada
they
go
to
the
polyethylene
nonrefillable
soft
plastic.
the
housewife
will
not
go
to
refillables.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
if
there
was,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
don't
recall
it.
however,
i
do
believe
that,
obviously,
there
was
conflicting
evidence
on
many
points
in
this
case,
and
the
court
did
make
a
determination
on
what
it
considered
to
be
the
great
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
minnesota
courts
found,
again...
if
there
is...
plastic
is
banned,
there
is
no
return
to
refillables,
and
the
milk
market
will
be
preempted
by
paperboard.
there
are
no
plans
as
i
indicated
for
federal
or
state
additional
regulation,
by
the
commission
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
what
if
they
had
said
that?
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
i
certainly
believe
so.
i
think
the
court
in
its--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--yes.
and
i
think
the
minnesota
courts
took
that
position.
i
think
this
court
has
taken
that
position
in--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--i
would
say
in
the
hunt
v.--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--the
apple
case.
a
new
jersey
case,
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey.
and
in
craig
v.
boren,
and
in
raymond
motor
freight,
all
of
which,
the
state
had
an
ostensible
purpose.
and
the
trial
court
found
on
the
basis
of
voluminous
evidence
that
that
purpose
was
not
being
effected
by
the
statute.
and
because
of
that,
this
court
found,
or
agreed,
that
the
mere
statement--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--well,
the
standard
as
i
understand
it...
and
i
think
the
standard
our
supreme
court
used...
is
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
the
legislature
to
have
conceived
that
these
means
would
bring
about
the
end
that
they
sought
to
bring
about.
and
i
believe
the
dukes
standard
on
equal
protection
is
the
one
that
was
followed
by
our
supreme
court.
the
minnesota
courts
found,
both
the
supreme
court
and
the
lower
court,
that
the
big
problem
with
disposable
waste
today
is
landfills,
and
the
effect
that
refuse
has
on
landfills.
it
found
that
because
plastic
is
not
biodegradable...
and
this
is
not
an
anti-litter
statute...
there
is
no
leaching
of
the
surface
waters
through
the
vegetable
matter
into
the
underground
aquifers
which
are
so
important
in
our
state,
and
i'm
sure
in
most
state;
no
methane
gas.
in
fact,
many...
the
evidence
showed
that
many
landfills
are
lined
with
plastic
to
stop
the
leaching.
furthermore,
you
have
stable
landfills.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
plastic
is
completely
recycleable
and
completely
combustible.
none
of
those
are
properties
of
the
so-called
paperboard
container,
which
incidentally
is
coated
with
plastic;
not
the
wax
that
you
used
to
get
years
ago,
it's
plastic-coated,
melded.
furthermore,
the
court
found,
both
courts,
that
plastic
containers
are
as
environmentally
sound
as
paperboard
in
a
number
of
other
matters,
and
in
no
case
is
it
inferior.
therefore
they
found
that
the
statute
is
really
not
an
environmental
statute.
the
statute
is
not
an
environmental
statute;
the
statute
is
for
the
purpose
of...
the
lower
court:
insulating
local
industry
from
out-of-state
competition;
and
the
supreme
court:
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--i
believe
it
is.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
the
supreme
court
said,
we
do
not
address
it
because
we
don't
have
to,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
pardon?
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
you
get
it
on
the
same
basis
that
you
got
the
barchi,
when
an
issue
was
not
litigated
in
barchi,
you
asked
that
it
be
briefed.
beazer...
new
york
city
transit
authority
v.
beazer,
where
the
lower
trial
court
decided
a
case
on
the
constitutional
issue,
filing
the
statutory
issues,
and
the
circuit
court,
if
i
recall,
addressed
only
one
of
the
issues,
and
you
decided
on
the
statutory
issues.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
we
did.
we
relied
on
it
in
both
courts
below,
we
briefed
it
in
both
courts.
we
briefed
it
in
our
opposition
to
cert
in
this
court.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
we
won
on
all
grounds
except
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
due
process,
substantive
due
process
and
equal
protection
were
both
based
on
the
rationality
nexus.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
and
so
it
didn't
address
it
too
well.
minnesota
did
not
decide
it
on
the
commerce
clause
issue
because
it
said
it
did
not--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--solely
on
equal
protection.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
there
is,
your
honor,
but
there
is
no
commerce
clause.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
we
did
not.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
because
the
two
clauses
are
identical,
and
we
felt
that
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--that
would
have
been...
we
didn't
understand
that.
it
was
our
feeling
that
if
the
two
are
identical
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--the
persons,
your
honor,
are
the
suppliers,
fabricators,
and--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--not
the
dairies;
no.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
they
are.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
it's
on
their
behalf
to
the
extent
that
they
fabricate
plastic
milk
bottles
in
minnesota.
some
of
the
dairies
do.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
pardon?
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
our
client
is
a
dairy
who
fabricates
these
plastic
milk
containers.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
not
to
the
extent
that
the
plastic
container,
we
feel,
or
at
least
the
evidence
showed,
was
a
much
more
attractive
container
and
permits
the
sale--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--not
internally.
however,
milk
is
competing
at
all
times
with
many
other,
with
soft
drinks
and
many
other
liquids.
and
in
that
case
the
package
or
container,
we
believe,
does
assist
the
sale
of
milk
by
these
dairies.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
it
does
when
there's
no
rational
basis
for
it.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
again,
i
think
that
there's
no
rational
nexus
for
the
discrimination
generally
speaking.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
i
don't
have
any
cases--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--what
is
the?
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
the
only--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--they're
both
liquids,
but--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--that's...
the
dairies,
i
believe,
find
that
in
order
to
compete
in
the
liquid,
consumer
market,
they
should
have
an
attractive
package
and
should
be
entitled
to
use
a
package
which
is
not
an
environmentally
harmful
package,
and
we're
back
again
to
the
lack
of
rationality
for
the
discrimination,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
we
submit
that
the
state
of
minnesota,
and
the
evidence
shows,
could
not
pass
an
effective
littering
bill,
or
could
not
pass
an
effective
container
deposit
bill.
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
do
it
politically.
so
out-of-state
interests
were
banned.
there
was
no
political
problem
whatsoever
with
the
banning
of
out-of-state
interests.
but
the
local
interests
such
as
the
can
manufacturers
and
others
who
would
be
affected
by
an
effect;
litter
or
container
deposit
bill
were
not
affected
by
this
legislation,
because
politically,
they
could
not
have
been.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
the
plastic
industry.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
no,
no,
only
in
regard
to
the
making
of
milk
bottles,
plastic
containers.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
i
was
very
unaware
of
that,
and
it
never
has
happened.
there
is
no...
there
are
fabricating
plants
in
minnesota
which
utilize
out-of-state
machinery
and
utilize
out-of-state
polyethylene,
but
there
are
no
plants
in
minnesota,
no
plastic
plants
in
minnesota.
there
are
none.
there
is,
however,
a
very
strong
can
lobby
in
the
state.
the
discrimination
in
this
matter,
we
submit,
for
interstate
commerce
purposes,
is
between
producers
of
milk
containers.
we
further
submit
that
the
movement
of
plastic
containers,
raw
material,
equipment,
is
halted
at
the
border
of
minnesota.
it
can't
get
into
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
retail.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
this
is
our
interstate
commerce,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
evidence
was
clear
that
phillips
petroleum
would
lose
about
half
a
million
dollars
annually
as
a
result
of
this
statute.
the
hoover
company
has
already
lost
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
and
it
would
be
absolutely
foreclosed
from
the
minnesota
market.
the
wells
dairy
in
le
mars,
iowa,
would
not
be
able
to
ship
about
a
million
gallons
of
plastic-contained
milk
into
minnesota
if
this
statute
were
permitted.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
yes...
i
don't
know
that
i
would.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
on
commerce--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--on
commerce;
yes.
that's
correct.
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
timber
interests
were
to
be
protected.
it's
the
third
largest
employer
in
our
state...
that
was
in
the
legislative
history.
the
plastic
industry
was
referred
to
by
the
author
of
the
bill
as
the
boys
in
the
alligator
shoes
from
new
york
and
chicago
who
were
going
to
come
in
our
state
and
tell
us
how
to
run
it;
no
importation
of
competing
petrochemicals
or
plastics
from
out-of-state.
further,
this
court
has
stated
that
protectionism
can
arise
from
the
effect
of
a
statute
as
well
as
from
a
protectionist
legislative
motion.
very
few
legislatures
state
exactly
that
they
are
going
to
cast
an
undue
burden
on
commerce.
but
the
practical
effect
of
the
statute...
and
which
it
is
here...
no
chemical
industry
in
minnesota,
no
plastic
industry;
there
is
an
extensive
timber
industry.
this
court
is
aware
of
a
number
of
recent
cases
by
hit,
just
in
regard
to
this
point.
the
evidence
convinced
the
minnesota
court
that
the
purported
state
goal
was
environmental
protection,
was
illusory.
at
least
the
trial
court
found
that.
and
that's
the
same
result
as
this
court
determined
in
regard
to
raymond
motor
transport.
then
the
state
of
wisconsin
said,
we're
going
to
promote
highway
safety.
this
court
said,
the
evidence
did
not
permit
that.

and
lewis:
we're
going
to
protect
the
consumer.
this
court
after
an
examination
of
the
evidence
found
in
the
contrary.
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey,
environment
and
public
health
were
going
to
be
supported
by
this
statute.
this
court
after
review
of
the
evidence
found
that
it
was
illusory.
a
slight
or
non-existent
legitimate
state
purpose
cannot
justify
a
burden
on
commerce,
even
though
the
burden
is
slight.
that
is
what
i
believe
this
court
has
said
in
these
matters,
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
commerce
clause
argument.
the
minnesota
court
also
found
that
equal
protection
was
violated
on
the
basis
of
no
rational
nexus.
i
am
aware
of
the
three-tiered
approach
used
by
this
court
in
that
matter
and
of
course
if
the
approach
should
be
abandoned,
we
submit
that
minnesota's
justification
of
the
statute
is
insufficient
to
support
the
discrimination
between
milk
containers.
there's
just
no...
whether
it's
rational
basis
or
whether
it's
substantial
state
purpose.
even
if
the
minnesota
end
be
legitimate,
the
court
held
that
the
means
selected
did
not
effect
an
appropriate
governmental
interest,
and
whereas
here
we
contend
that
the
end
is
not
legitimate,
the
discriminatory
classification
cannot
be
related
to
a
proper
state
interest.
now,
we're
aware,
and
our
court
was
aware
of
railway
express,
of
dukes,
and
williamson.
those
cases
held
that
legislatures
are
free
to
at
least
perceive
evils
on
a
step
by
step
basis.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
as
long
as
it's
a
step.
and
our
supreme
court--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--that's
what
our
supreme
court
said.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
and
the
district
court.
and
again,
on
the
basis
that
a
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
begins
with
one
foot
forward,
is
valid
only
if
that
foot
is
forward,
we
submit,
and
sideways
or
backwards
doesn't...
the
aphorism
is
untrue.
we
submit
that
that
is
what
our
court
held
on
the
basis
of
voluminous
findings
of
fact,
that
the
step
is
not
a
forward
step,
and
because
of
that
the
statute
cannot
be
justified
under
the
commerce
clause,
we
submit,
and
also
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
determined,
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
over
and
over.
yes,
they
argued
that--
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
--your
honor,
they
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
on
the
basis
that
legislative
enactments
cannot
be
examined
by
the
courts.
they
lost
that
in
the
district
court.
they
argued
it
again
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
supreme
court.
the
minnesota
court
held
that
the
courts
could
not
and
should
not
abandon
their
role
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
statutes.
that
is
simply
what
they
held.
mr.
leonard
j.
keyes
i
don't
know
that
we
did.
i
don't
know
that
we
would.
i
do
know
that
our
minnesota
court
was
certainly
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
not
super-legislatures
and
that
they
have
a
distinctive
role
in
the
constitutionality
of
statutes.
and
they
exercised
it.
