the
other
case,
minnesota
versus
clover
leaf
creamery
company,
in
1977,
the
minnesota
legislature
enacted
the
statute
banning
the
sale
of
milk
and
plastic
nonreturnable,
nonrefillable
containers
but
permitting
such
sale
in
other
nonreturnable,
nonrefillable
containers,
such
as
paperboard
milk
cartons.
and
respondents
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
is
violated
on
the
equal
protection
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
sustained
the
challenge
on
the
equal
protection
ground
without
reaching
the
commerce
clause
challenge.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
minnesota
legislature
recited
expressly
in
a
preamble
to
the
act
that
the
purposes
of
its
passage
were
to
promote
resource
conservation,
ease
solid
waste
disposal
problems
and
conserve
energy.
and
all
of
the
parties
are
in
agreement
that
these
are
entirely
legitimate
state
purposes.
the
equal
protection
inquiry
has
thus
narrowed
to
the
inquiry
whether
the
legislative
classification
distinguishing
between
plastic
and
nonplastic
nonreturnable
milk
containers
is
rationally
achieve
to
the
--
related
rather
to
achievement
of
the
statutory
purposes.
in
other
words,
voluminous
evidence
bearing
on
that
subject
before
the
minnesota
legislature
prior
to
enactment
of
the
law
and
the
minnesota
district
court
in
this
proceeding
also
had
voluminous
evidence
on
the
question.
we
hold
however
that
where
as
plainly
was
the
case
here,
there
was
evidence
before
the
minnesota
legislature
reasonably
supporting
the
classifications
even
though
conflicting
with
other
evidence
before
the
legislature.
litigants
may
not
procure
in
validation
of
the
legislation
merely
by
tendering
evidence
in
court
that
the
legislature
was
mistaken
in
its
choice.
insofar
as
the
ban
of
the
act
is
limited
to
plastic
containers,
we
hold
further
that
this
is
a
case
for
application
of
the
well
settled
principle
that
a
legislature,
without
violating
the
equal
protection
clause,
need
not
strike
at
all
evils
at
the
same
time
or
on
the
same
way,
but
may
implement
its
program
step
by
step
adopting
regulations
that
only
partially
ameliorate
a
perceived
evil
and
deferring
complete
elimination
of
the
evil
to
future
regulations.
in
other
words,
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
deny
the
state
of
minnesota
the
authority
to
ban
one
type
of
milk
container,
in
this
instance
plastic,
conceded
the
cause
environmental
problems,
merely
because
another
type
paperboard
containers
already
established
in
the
minnesota
market
are
permitted
to
continue
in
use.
the
minnesota
legislature
on
the
record
before
it
could
rationally
have
decided
that
its
ban
on
plastic
might
foster
greater
use
of
environmentally
desirable
alternatives.
although
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
not
address
the
commerce
clause
challenge,
our
opinion
does
so
and
here
also,
we
hold
the
challenges
without
merit.
the
statute
does
not
as
claimed
affect
simple
protectionism
favoring
in-state
manufacturers
and
the
cardboard
container
over
out-of-state
manufacturers
of
plastic
containers.
rather
the
statute
regulates
evenhandedly
by
prohibiting
all
milk
retailers
from
selling
their
products
and
plastic
without
regard
to
whether
the
milk,
the
containers
of
the
sellers
are
from
outside
the
state.
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
is
reversed,
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
