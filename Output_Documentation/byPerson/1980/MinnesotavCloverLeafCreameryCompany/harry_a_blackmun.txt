justice
blackmun
do
you
think
the
minnesota
legislature
is
about
next
time
to
ban
paper
containers?
justice
blackmun
well,
whether...
was
there
legislation
introduced
to
that
effect
in
the
session
in
which
this
one
was
passed?
justice
blackmun
well,
the
milk
industry
and
the
pulpwood
industry
in
minnesota
both
have
clout,
and...
i
guess
my
question
is,
how
political
this
is,
rather
than
how
environmentally
protective?
