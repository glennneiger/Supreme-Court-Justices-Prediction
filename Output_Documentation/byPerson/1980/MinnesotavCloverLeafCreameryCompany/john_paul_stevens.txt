justice
stevens
general
raschke,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
happened
during
the
last
three
years?
did
they
all
convert
to
plastic?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
if
they
have
in
fact
all
converted,
as
i
guess
they've
been
permitted
to
do,
then
the
reason
for
the
legislation
would
have
passed,
wouldn't
it?
the
idea
was
to
stop
them
from
doing
that.
justice
stevens
and
the
second
question,
this
perhaps
duplicates
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked,
but
as
i
understand
it,
part
of
the
rationale
was,
you've
to
stop
this
because
we're
going
to
get
rid
of
all
disposable
containers
and
paper
containers
would
be
next.
has
there
been
any
activity
to
get
rid
of
the
paper
containers
at
all?
is
there
anything
on
the
public
record,
subsequent
to
1977?
justice
stevens
i
don't
see
how
the
outcome,
whichever
way
the
case
is
decided,
if
the
goal
really
is
to
get
rid
of
these
containers,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
they
don't
enact
the
second
statute.
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
least
offensive
regulation
is
to
let
the
paper
containers
continue
forever,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
but
i
don't
understand
why
not.
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
disposable
containers,
why
don't
you
say,
no
paper
containers
after
five
years,
or
whatever
the
time
would
be?
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
remove
the
constitutional
argument
that
your
court
relied
on.
justice
stevens
it
would
remove
any
constitutional
question
and
it
would
clearly
accomplish
your
environmental
goal.
the
fact
that
you
don't
do
it
makes
one
wonder
whether
that's
really
the
purpose
of
the
legislation.
justice
stevens
--i
don't
understand
that
last
argument
guaranteeing
it.
all
they
have
to
do
is
ban
the
other
container
too,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
the
difference
with
the
dukes
case
is,
it
was
clear
from
that
legislation
that
as
time
passed
on
the
people
who
were
then
in
business
would
go
out
of
business.
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
say
that
you're
ever
going
to
prohibit
paper
containers.
justice
stevens
this
is
no
one
step
at
a
time
argument.
it's
just
one
step,
period,
is
what
you're
saying.
you're
going
to
take
one
step
with
no
desire
to
take
the
other
step.
justice
stevens
or
even
to
have
any
indication
that
it
ever
intends
to
take
the
second
step.
justice
stevens
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
dalton,
can
i
ask
you,
on
this
question
of
federal
interest,
if
there
is
a
choice
presented
in
any
commerce
situation
between
using
plastic
containers
and
paper
containers
for
dairy
products,
are
you
saying
that
there's
a
federal
interest
in
choosing
paper
over
plastic?
justice
stevens
is
the
federal
government
indifferent
as
to
whether
paper
or
plastic
is
used,
or
does
it
have
a
preference?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that
but
if
there's
a
choice
between
two
disposables,
one
paper
and
one
plastic,
does
the
federal
government
have
an
interest
in
one
over
the
other?
justice
stevens
well,
then
your
answer
is,
yes.
justice
stevens
you
do.
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
preferring
plastic
disposable
containers
over
paper
disposable
containers?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
we
shouldn't
make
assumptions.
you're
telling
us
what
the
federal
government's
interest
is,
and
presumably
you've
made
the
factual
determination
that
makes
one
preferable
to
the
other.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
i'm
curious
about
the
federal
interest
in
this
particular
issue,
and
is
there
a
federal
interest
in
preferring
plastic
over
paper
in
disposable
containers?
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
whether
you've
answered
this
or
not.
justice
stevens
seems
to
me
it's
a
yes
or
no
question.
justice
stevens
would
you
have
the
same
interest
if
a
neighboring
state
said,
we
will
allow
plastic
but
not
paper,
because
we
think
that's
environmentally
superior?
would
you
also
say
that
choice
should
be
defended
in
the
same
rationale?
justice
stevens
mr.
keyes,
isn't
there
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
with
respect
to
gallon
jugs,
if
you
ban
plastic,
they
will
go
back
to
glass
instead
of
the
paper,
because
the
paper
gallon
container,
as
opposed
to
the
quart
or
half-gallon,
is
pretty
unsatisfactory?
justice
stevens
now,
the
dairies
are
parties
to
this
litigation?
justice
stevens
so
this
argument
isn't
really
advanced
on
their
behalf?
justice
stevens
they
may
want
to,
but
how
are
they
being
treated
differently
than
any
other
dairy?
every
dairy
has
the
right
to
sell
milk
in
paper
containers
but
not
in
plastic
containers.
aren't
all
dairies
being
treated
alike?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
you
think
it's
better
and
it's
irrational.
i'm
just
addressing
myself
to
the
equal
protection
theory.
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
in
which
all
businesses
within
the
state
are
treated
alike,
it's
just
that
they
can't
engage
in
the
laundry
business
or
the
plastics
business,
whatever
it
might
be.
does
that
violate
equal
protection
clause?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
i
asked
if
there
is
any
precedent
for
holding
that
denying
a
business
the
right
to
engage
in
a
particular
kind
of
activity
violates
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
stevens
do
you
have
any
cases
for
that
proposition?
justice
stevens
your
answer
is,
no,
you
don't
have
any
cases
for
that
proposition?
