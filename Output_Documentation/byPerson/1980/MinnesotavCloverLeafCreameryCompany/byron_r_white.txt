justice
white
well,
didn't
the
supreme
court
also
say
that
specifically
the
stated
legislative
finding
of
the
act
is
that
nonrefillable
milk
containers
present
solid
waste
problems
and
the
stated
legislative
goal
is
that
the
use
of
returnable
milk
containers
should
be
encouraged?
and
then
it
said,
"the
act,
undoubtedly,
deals
with
legitimate
state
interests.
"
justice
white
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
the
trial
court's--
justice
white
it's
been
three
years
now,
hasn't
it?
justice
white
and
have
you
begun
to
take
the
second
step
or
not?
justice
white
well,
so,
has
the
result
of
this
case
been
that
plastics
are
now
being
used?
justice
white
so
the
rationale
has
disappeared
now
for
saying
that
we
started
with
plastics
because
they
really
hadn't
come
in
yet?
justice
white
well,
that's
past
now,
isn't
it?
justice
white
would
you
be
here
if
the
statute
had
said,
no
plastics
and
also
no
paper,
five
years
from
now?
justice
white
suppose
that
at
the
time
the
legislation
was
passed
the
industry
was
using
plastic
and
paper
half
and
half,
and
the
minnesota
court
said,
well,
we
want
to
get
to
returnables
and
we're
going
to
start
with
plastic.
so
no
plastic.
wouldn't
that
be
rationally
connected
with
it?
justice
white
well,
it
may
not
be.
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
would
be
constitutional.
i
just
said--
justice
white
--would
it
be
rationally
connected?
if
prevented
half
the
nonreturnables,
i
suppose
it's
rationally
connected,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
why
isn't
it
rationally
connected
if
the
legislature
said,
well,
plastic's
about
to
come,
we're
going
to
keep
it
from
coming?
justice
white
well,
then,
you're
back
in
my
first
question,
then.
justice
white
that
may
be
so
but
if
the
statute
had
banned
all
nonreturnables,
that
certainly
is
rationally
connected
to
an
end,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
they
wouldn't
have
gone
on
using
nonreturnables.
justice
white
they
would
have
shifted
to
glass
or
something.
justice
white
well,
then,
why
can't
the
legislature
say,
half
at
a
time?
justice
white
it
would
be
one
step,
though.
you
can't
say
that--
justice
white
--so,
if
the
legislature
had
started
with
paper,
you
would
suggest
that
everybody
would
have
gone
to
plastic?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
legislative
findings
had
in
so
many
words
found
that,
if
we
ban
plastic,
there
will
be
a
substantial
switch
to
returnables?
justice
white
yes,
what
if
they
had
said
that,
and
then...
is
a
court
then
free
to
refind
that,
to
make
some
contrary
findings?
justice
white
do
you
have
to
take
that
position?
i
suppose
you
do,
don't
you?
justice
white
in
what
case
is
that?
justice
white
in
the
apple
case?
justice
white
well,
what
is
the
standard?
that
there
isn't
any
rational
basis
for
the
legislative
finding,
or
that,
although
it
may
be
rational,
we
find
the
facts
to
the
contrary?
what
is
the
standard?
justice
white
then
you
won
in
the
district
court
on
all
your
grounds,
didn't
you?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
it
was
just
on
equal
protection,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
was
there
an
equal
protection
clause
in
the
minnesota
constitution?
justice
white
i
understand
that.
so...
but
you
didn't
present
any
state
grounds?
justice
white
why
didn't
you?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you'd
have
won
on
the
state
ground,
they
could
never
have
come
here.
justice
white
if
the
two
are
identical,
you
would
have
won
on
the
state
ground
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
and
there
would
have
been
no
resort
to
this
court.
mr.
keyes,
on
the
equal
protection
theory
of
the
case,
the
equal
protection
clause
says
that
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
who
are
the
persons
that
you
say
have
been
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
justice
white
they're
not
the
dairies?
justice
white
well,
if
they
had
banned
both
plastic
and
paper,
i
suppose
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
white
well,
why
not,
if--
justice
white
--it
would
still
keep
these,
the
very
people
out
that
you
just
mentioned?
justice
white
as
long
as
it's
a
step.
justice
white
but
this
is
a
non-step,
you
say?
justice
white
and
the
district
court?
justice
white
did
the
state
ever
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
was
disentitled
to
second
guess
the
findings
of
the
legislature?
justice
white
and
the
minnesota...
so
the
minnesota
court
in
effect
says,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
state
supreme
court
and
courts
are
perfectly
allowed
and
it's
permissible
to
look
into
legislative
findings.
justice
white
well,
mightn't
you
get
a
different
answer
to
that
question
in
terms
of
whether
you're
relying
on
the
federal
constitution
or
the
state?
justice
white
would
that
be
a
matter
outside
judicial
notice?
i
suppose
you
would
suggest
it
is.
justice
white
is
that
a
matter
outside
of
judicial
notice
or...
i
suppose
you'd
say
it
is.
justice
white
does
the
fact
that
trees
grow
in
minnesota--
justice
white
what
did
the
district
court
find?
justice
white
what
did
the
district
court
find?
