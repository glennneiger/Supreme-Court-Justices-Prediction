he
says
it's
not
that
he
wants
to
have,
he's
entitled
to
have;
that's
your
argument.
justice
stewart
but
against
his
will?
justice
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
as
suggested
by
my
brother
powell
is
a
little
bit
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
the
statute
doesn't
impose
a
duty
upon
an
employer
to
make
reasonable
efforts,
but
it
says--
justice
stewart
--it
seems
to
give
absolute
entitlements.

requirement
is
an
absolute
duty.
justice
stewart
if
the
statute
means
what
you
say
it
means.
justice
stewart
well,
no,
it
doesn't--
--where
is
that

justice
stewart
but
here,
if
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
40
hours
a

and
not
entitled
simply
to
his
employer's
making
reasonable
efforts
to
see
to
it
that
he
has
40
hours.
justice
stewart
well,
he
gets
paid
as
a
reservist.
justice
stewart
he
gets
pay
on
his
weekends
as
a
reservist,
but
not
from
this--
