justice
white
well,
did
the
employer
treat
this
reservist
like
he
treated
other
employees
who
wanted
to
be
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
submission
is
that
he's
not
entitled
to
do
that,
that
he...
that
the
statute
puts
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
requires
him
to
treat
the
reservists
more
favorably
than
others,
including
more
favorably
with
respect
to
absences?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
just
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
he
is
to
give
more
favorable
treatment
to
these
absences
than
to
other?
justice
white
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
rescheduling,
does
it?
justice
white
it
does
give
him,
certainly,
something
other
employees
don't
have.
he
can
be
away
for
reserve
duty
and
still
maintain
his
seniority
and
other
things,
so
certainly
there
is
a
statute
here
directed
to
reservists,
but...
it
specifically
says
what
the
employer
may
not
deprive
him
of,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
his
having
to
change
his
shifts
or
anything.
justice
white
the
right
to
work
40
hours?
justice
white
where
is
the
right,
where's
that
in,
the
source
of
any
right
to
work
40
hours
a
week?
justice
white
yes,
but
who
guaranteed
him
the
right
to
work
40
hours
a
week?
justice
white
where
was
that
guaranteed
him?
justice
white
what
if
there
are
two
employees;
this
man
goes
off
to
reserve
duty
and
the
employer
says,
fine,
i'll
reschedule,
i'll
try
to
work
it
out,
and
he
does,
and
then
a
man
comes
to
him
and
says,
i
understand
so
and
so
is
getting
off
for
reserve
duty
and
gets
rescheduled.
every
time
he
goes
to
reserve
duty
i
want
to
go
fishing,
for
the
same
amount
of
time
and
please
reschedule
me,
just
the
same
schedule.
and
the
employer
says,
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind.
you
can't;
or,
i
will
not
do
it.
now,
you
say
that
the
employer
certainly
could
say
that
in
the
latter
case,
but
he
couldn't
say
that
to
the
reservist?
justice
white
he
certainly
is
being
favored,
isn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
so
you
do
say
that
it
is
a
special
treatment,
that
the
act
does
give
him
special
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
is
not
satisfied
by
treating
the
reservist
like
everyone
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
argument
about
that.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
congress
intended
to
give
him
preference
for
his
being
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
voluntary
trades
have
been
exhausted
in
this
case,
haven't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
mean
other
employees
would
have
to
work
fewer
weekend
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
works
more
weekend
days
than
would
be
normal
and
the
company
only
needs
a
total
of
x
weekend
days,
i'm
not
saying
that
other
employees
wouldn't
welcome
the
opportunity
to
work
fewer
weekend
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
might
be
two
in
january
and
none
in
february,
instead
of
one
in
each
month?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
this
isn't
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
mcauliffe,
when
you
grant
him
a
leave
of
absence,
which
you
agree
you
have
to
do
without
firing
him...
he
can
be
away
from
work,
and
he
won't
be
paid
under
your
submission,
but
he
can't
be
fired
for
being
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
do
when
he's
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
position.
you
certainly
need
to
fill
the
job
while
he's
away.
so
what
do
you
do?
require
other
employees
to
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
do
it?
do
you
assign
people
who
should
be
off
on
the
weekend
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
paying
him
but
not
the
fellow
who's
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
cost
you
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
a
way
of
it
not
costing
you
any
money
to
accommodate
yourself
to
the
leave
of
absence?
you
could
let
him
be
away
and
not
fire
him,
and
still
get
the
work
done
by
your
extra
crew?
justice
white
yes,
i
know,
you
have
to...
but
that
isn't
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
this
purpose;
for
this
particular
purpose.
they
didn't
say
you
had
to
treat
him
the
same
for
seniority.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
must
do
what
the
government
says,
i
take
it
you'll
be
doing
more
than
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
calls
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
it
violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
you
to
do
what
the
government
says?
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
impossible,
it
isn't
impossible
to
give
him
his
40
hours.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
be
in
any
case,
would
it?
justice
white
all
the
employer
would
have
to
do
is
to
pay
overtime.
justice
white
i
know,
but
if
he's
gone
on
weekends,
you
can
assign
somebody
else
to
work
for
him.
or
pay
him
even
though
he's
not
there.
justice
white
so,
he
has
the
right
to
work
40
hours
and
not
just
the
right
to
a
leave?
