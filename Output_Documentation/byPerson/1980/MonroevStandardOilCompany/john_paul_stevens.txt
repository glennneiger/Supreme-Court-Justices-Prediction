justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
distinction
of
the
hardison
case
now?
supposing
here...
and
i
don't
think
the
record
tells
us
whether
this
is
true
or
not,
but
suppose
it
was
here,
in
order
to
accommodate
his
desire
to
be
off
on
the
days
where
he
had
reserve
obligations,
one
out
of
every
four
weekends,
the
schedule
would
require
some
other
employee
to
work
more
weekends
than
he
wanted.
now,
let's
assume
it's
undesirable
to
work
weekends.
does
your
position
apply
even
if
the
rescheduling
would
impose,
may
give
him
a
preference
at
times
of
desirable
work?
or
does
it
only
relate
to
the
cases
where,
given
the
requirement
of
meeting
his
demands,
everybody
still
has
the
same
employment
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he's
getting
more
than
equal
treatment,
if
other
employees
have
to
take
some
undesirable
work.
that
seems
to
be
rather
clear
in
that
case.
i
don't
know
whether
this
fellow's
in
that
category
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
point
is
that
if
the
company
could
rearrange
the
schedules
in
a
way
that
didn't
put
any
other
employee
in
any
worse
position
than
they're
in
under
the
normal
scheduling,
that
then
he
has
the
right
to
reschedule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
question
would
be
comparable
if
he
wanted
to
work
during
august
when
they
scheduled
him
for
vacation,
and
he
had
to
go
to
the
reserves
in
july.
then
it
would
be
like
your
first
and
third,
and
second
and
fourth.
i
understand
you
to
be
arguing,
yes,
he
has
a
right
to
have
his
vacation
in
the
month
in
which
the
reserve
obligation
falls.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
tell
whether
it
can
be
accommodated?
there's
always
a
little
extra
work
if
they
stop
using
the
a-m
schedule.
what
is
the
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true,
as
justice
white
suggests,
that
the
statute
is
therefore
giving
him
something
no
other
employee
has?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
got
a
right
to
some
kind
of
special
consideration
at
the
time
the
work
schedule
is
prepared?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
saying
that
he's
the
only
one
in
the
store
who
can
say,
i
want
to
take
my
vacation
in
july,
or
i'm
the
only
one
in
the
store
who
says,
even
though
my
name
begins
with
a,
i
want
to
have
my
first
and
third
with
the
n?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcauliffe,
could
i
interrupt
with
a
question,
because
it
affects
the
argument
right
here?
i
didn't
know
from
the
record
that
there
were
seven
weekends
off
and
45
on,
but
i'm
sure
that's
correct
if
you
tell
us
that.
are
you
also
telling
us
that
you
could
not
schedule
this
man
so
he'd
have
12
weekends
off
but
still
work
the
same
number
of
saturdays
and
sundays?
in
other
words,
he'd
have
to
work
both
days
on
more
weekends,
to
work
the
same
number
of
total
weekend
days?
are
you
saying
you
couldn't
do
that,
because
of
the
schedule?
there's
my
question
to
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
the
one
at
page
29?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can
change...
i
still
don't
think
you've
answered
my
question.
my
question
is
whether
he
could
be
scheduled
with
the
number
of
days
off
he
needs,
the
number
of
saturdays
and
sundays
off
to
accommodate
his
reserve
obligation,
without
requiring
any
other
other
employee
in
the
plant
to
work
any
more
saturdays
or
sundays
than
they
now
have
to
work
under
the
regular
routine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
you
may
have
more
than
one
service
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
this
one
question.
maybe
you
were
going
to
address
it.
in
your
brief
you
say,
"this
case
presents
a
radically
different
issue
from
that
presented
in
the
safeway
case
in
the
5th
circuit.
"
do
you
think
the
5th
circuit
case
was
correctly
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
seems
to
me
your
position
really
is
inconsistent
with
the
5th
circuit's
holding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
way
to
put
the
question,
i
suppose,
would
you
think
this
case
would
be
different
if
instead,
if
the
agreement,
instead
of
giving
the
employees
a
right
to
be
scheduled
for
40
hours,
had
said
they
have
a
right
to
work
40
hours?
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
would
still
be
that
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
seems
to
me
you'd
still
argue
they've
got
to
show
up
for
work
to
get...
if
you
offer
them
the
job
for
40
hours,
that
satisfies
your
requirement
under
the
agreement
and
it
also
would
meet
the
statute.
