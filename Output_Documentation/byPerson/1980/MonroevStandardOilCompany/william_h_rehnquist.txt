justice
rehnquist
but
under
your
theory,
every
time
that
a
worker
is
dissatisfied
with
the
employer's
effort
to
accommodate,
it
would
be
a
question
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
court,
whether
there
had
been
good
faith
effort
to
accommodate
him.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
it's
a
very
flexible
type
of
thing,
that
the
employer
does
not
have
to--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you've
also
got
seven
days
a
week,
24
hours
a
day,
scheduling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
question
about
that
being
violated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
statute
had
been
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
korean
war
when,
let's
say,
someone
like
ted
williams
was
called
back
into
the
service?
do
you
think
after
a
two-year
tour
of
duty
in
korea
the
veteran
could
come
back
and
say,
i
want
to
be
paid
for
all
the
time
i
was
away?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
horowitz,
supposing
that
this
man
had
a
two-week
summer
duty
and
when
he
came
back
from
it
he
gets
paid
so
much
for
being
in
the
reserves,
he
couldn't
claim
the
complete
wages
that
he
would
have
received,
but
he
made
a
claim
against
the
employer
for
the
difference
between
what
he
got
paid
by
the
government
for
his
reserve
duty
and
what
he
would
have
made
had
he
stayed
at
the
plant
and
worked?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
it's
seasonal
employment
and
his
reserve
duty
occurs
during
the
season,
he
has
no
claim?
a
cannery-type
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
rule
were
that
there's
a
one-month
vacation
for
all
employees,
and
the
vacation
for
a-to-m
employees
is
july
and
the
vacation
for
n-to-z
employees
is
august,
and
some
have
scheduled,
say,
refresher
teaching
courses,
some
have
scheduled
vacations
with
their
families,
some
have
scheduled
any
number
of
things.
would
you
say
that
the
reservist
has
a
right
to
insist
that
he
get
the
vacation
time
contrary
to
policy
because
of
his
one-month
reserve
duty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
his
reserve
duty
comes
in
august,
and
he
wants
a
vacation,
but
he's
also
a
member
of
the
reserves?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
regard
the
reserve
duty
as
vacation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
guarantee
that
he
will
be
paid
during
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
congress
pass
the
most
recent
amendment
to
the
veterans
reemployment
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
dumped,
in
effect,
after
a
pro
forma
compliance
with
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
the
company
have
at
least
undertaken
on
its
own
to
have
solicited
other
employees
to
see
if
they
wanted
to
take
this
man's
place
while
he
was
at
camp,
rather
than
leaving
it
totally
up
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
you
yourself,
as
my
brother
stewart
suggested,
construing
it
more
narrowly
than
it's
literally
written?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
horiwitz,
when
congress
enacted
this
statute
and
its
amendments,
did
it
confide
its
administration
to
the
department
of
defense
or
department
of
labor,
or
did
it
not
confide
it
to
any
of
the
administrative
departments?
