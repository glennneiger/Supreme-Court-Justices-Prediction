chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
monroe
v.
standard
oil.
mr.
horowitz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
this
statute
is
comparable
to
what
some
states
have,
with
special
provisions
made
for
people
called
for
jury
service?
is
military
service
in
the
same
ball
park
as
jury
service?
chief
justice
burger
well,
that's
what
he
was
employed
for.
the
employer
would
have
been
glad
to
have
him,
if
he
had
worked
the
40
hours
he
wanted
him
to
work.
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
it
a
question
of
a
guarantee,
counsel?
or
is
it
simply
that,
were
it
not
for
his
reservist
status,
he
would
work
40
hours
a
week,
and
it's
because
of
his
reservist
status
that
he's
put
in
what
you
regard
as
a
position
of
discrimination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
congress
made
any
provision
for
going
fishing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
fundamentally
different
from
the
situation
of
a
man
who's
gone
to
korea
or
vietnam
or
wherever?
he
comes
back
and
is
given
"special
treatment"
by
getting
seniority
for
service
he
did
not
perform
for
the
employer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mcauliffe,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
a
reservist
in
this
setting
is
just
like
some
fellow
who
is
moonlighting,
working
for
a
seven-eleven
store
or?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
singled
out
this
one
category
of
people,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
did
that
to
encourage
people
to
go
into
the
military
reserve,
did
they
not?
do
you
doubt
this
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
assume
it.
is
there
any
doubt
about
it
in
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
had
been
100,
for
example,
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
someone
would
put
that
in
evidence
as
distinguished
from
five
or
ten?
chief
justice
burger
to
try
to
accommodate
100
reservists
would
be
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
problem,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me.
i
think
mr.
justice
stevens
had
a
question
for
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
horowitz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
