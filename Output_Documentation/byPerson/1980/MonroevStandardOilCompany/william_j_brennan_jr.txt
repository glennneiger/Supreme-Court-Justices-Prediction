justice
jr.
do
you
have
suggestions,
mr.
horowitz,
how
do
you
think
the
employer
should
accommodate
to
satisfy
his
obligation
under
the
statute?
justice
jr.
all
right,
let's
start
with
these.
justice
jr.
suppose
that's
tried
and
that
doesn't
work,
then
what?
what
should
the
employer
do?
justice
jr.
at
least
by
that
method
he
can't
accommodate
him.
justice
jr.
so
that
he
works
five
days
other
than
the
weekend?
justice
jr.
are
the
problems
of
accommodation,
mr.
horowitz,
any
different
under
this
statute
than
under
those
statutes
that
the
congress
has
enacted
requiring
accommodation
of
religious
preferences?
justice
jr.
more
required
here?
even
though
that's
rather
constitutionally
based,
isn't
it,
under
title
vii?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
mr.
mcauliffe,
as
i
understand
your
submission,
it
is
that
all
that
congress
required
you
to
do
was
(a)
let
him
have
a
leave
of
absence,
and
(b)
on
his
return
give
him
what
the
statute
expressly
identifies,
namely,
restore
seniority,
status,
pay,
and
vacation.
and
that's
all
you
have
to
do
because
congress
didn't
say
you
had
to
do
any
more?
justice
jr.
he
comes
back
with
the
same
seniority
as
if
he'd
not
taken
a
leave
of
absence,
under
the
statute,
doesn't
he?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
that's
the
same
wording
that's
appeared
in
some
of
these
veterans
return
statutes.
justice
jr.
well,
my
question
was
going
to
be,
haven't
we
had
some
of
our
cases
under
the
veterans
return
statutes
that
have
interpreted
this
wording
a
little
more
broadly
than
you
submit?
you
don't
think
so?
justice
jr.
at
least
the
union
will
probably
say
so.
justice
jr.
and
is
the
union
in
here?
