mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit.
the
issue
involves
the
construction
of
section
38
u.s.c.
2021(b)(3),
a
section
of
what
are
commonly
known
as
the
veterans's
reemployment
rights
provisions.
this
section,
enacted
in
1968,
provides
that
reservists
"shall
not
be
denied
retention
in
employment,
or
any
promotion
or
other
incident
or
advantage
of
employment
because
of
any
obligation
as
a
member
of
a
reserve
component
of
the
armed
forces.
"
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
petitioner
is
employed
at
respondent's
refinery
in
lima,
ohio.
this
refinery
operates
around
the
clock,
seven
days
a
week,
three
eight-hour
shifts
per
day.
each
employee
works
five
days
per
week
for
a
total
of
40
hours,
according
to
a
rotating
shift
schedule
that
is
established
by
the
respondent.
during
1975
and
1976
petitioner
was
a
member
of
a
reserve
component
of
the
armed
forces,
which
entailed
certain
training
obligations.
as
a
general
rule
he
was
required
to
train
with
his
unit
on
one
weekend
per
month.
in
establishing
the
shift
schedule,
respondent
took
no
cognizance
of
petitioner's
training
obligations
and
therefore
petitioner
was
frequently
scheduled
to
work
on
weekend
days
that
conflicted
with
his
training
obligations.
thus,
unless
he
was
able
to
arrange
a
voluntary
exchange
of
shifts
with
a
fellow
employee,
petitioner
was
unable
to
work
40
hours
during
those
weeks,
and
respondent
made
other
arrangements
for
other
employees
to
substitute
for
him.
as
a
result,
petitioner
lost
192
hours
of
work
and
salary
over
a
15-month
period.
now,
the
parties
entered
into
a
stipulation
in
the
district
court
and
stipulated
that
respondent
took
no
steps
to
provide
petitioner
with
any
work
hours
during
these
weeks
to
substitute
for
those
lost
as
a
result
of
his
military
obligations.
petitioner
brought
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
alleging
that
respondent's
failure
to
attempt
to
accommodate
his
reserve
obligations
violated
his
statutory
rights
guaranteed
by
section
2021(b)(3).
based
upon
a
stipulated
set
of
facts
the
district
court
granted
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
held
that
respondent
had
denied
the
petitioner
the
right
to
a
40-hour
week,
an
incident
or
advantage
of
employment
under
the
act
by
refusing
to
take
account
of
his
reserve
obligations
in
its
scheduling.
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
right
to
be
scheduled
for
a
40-hour
work
week
at
respondent's
refinery
was
an
incident
or
advantage
of
employment
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
court
and
with
other
courts
of
appeals
as
to
the
scope
of
the
protection
that
the
statute
provides
such
a
benefit.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
section
2021(b)(3)
protects
reservists
only
against
intentional
unequal
treatment
or
on-the-job
bias
by
their
employers.
however,
if
a
reservist
is
denied
an
employment
benefit
because
of
the
operation
of
"a
facially
neutral
rule"
that
is
applied
uniformly
to
all
employees,
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
statute
is
not
violated.
applying
these
principles
to
this
case,
the
court
held
that
respondent
had
not
violated
the
act.
petitioner's
work
schedule
was
established
without
regard
to
his
training
obligations
and
his
training-related
absences
were
treated
just
as
other
nonmilitary
absences
of
another
employee
would
have
been
treated.
thus,
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
neutral
treatment,
not
bias,
was
shown.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
principles
on
which
the
court
based
its
decision
stem
from
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
statute.
congress
did
not
intend
that
employers
would
be
permitted
blindly
to
follow
rules
that,
although
neutral
on
their
face,
have
an
inevitable
adverse
effect
on
reservists
not
in
situations
where
that
adverse
impact
can
be
completely
eliminated
if
the
employer
seeks
to
accommodate
rather
than
simply
ignore
the
fact
of
petitioner's
reserve
obligations.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
you
mean,
on
these
specific
facts?
it
depends,
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
okay,
well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
the
actual
means
of
accommodation
is
really
an
issue
in
this
case
because
the
record
reveals
that
the
employer
made
no
effort
to
make
any
arrangements.
often
it
can
be
arranged
simply
by
exchanging
shifts.
for
example,
in
this
case,
other
employees
had
to
take
respondent's
shift,
employees
that
work
on
a
so-called
extra
board,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
why
petitioner
couldn't
then
have
taken
shifts
caused
by
the
extra
board
employees.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
other
words,
it's
impossible
for
the
employer
to
accommodate
in
that
sense?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
would
also
suggest
that
he
should
have
taken
account
of
these
obligations
in
the
schedule
itself.
in
other
words,
first,
have
a
schedule
for
petitioner's
off
weekends,
on
those
weekends
when
he
had
military
obligations,
and
then
fill
in
his
schedule
around
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
only
in
the
week
that
he
has
the
reserve
obligations.
he
would
still
work
the
same
number
of
weekends
over
the
course
of
the
year,
as
everyone
else.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
he's
dissatisfied
with
the
accommodation.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
benefit
is
denied
to
him.
now,
if
the
employer
didn't
give
him
a
40-hour
work
week,
for
example.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
courts...
the
courts
are
not
going
to
be
overrun
by
cases
now
deciding
what's
reasonable
accommodation.
there's
been
a
lot
of
litigation
in
this
area
already,
and
it's
always
been
a
dispute
over
what
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is.
there's
never
been
any
question
in
these
other
cases
that
the
employer
couldn't
accommodate.
in
most
situations
it's
no
trouble
at
all.
for
example,
in
the
5th
circuit
case,
in
the
west
case,
which
we've
asserted
as
directly
in
conflict
with
this
one,
the
employer
conceded
that
it
was
no
trouble
to
arrange
the
schedule
that
way.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
may
raise
a
slightly
more
difficult
question
because
you
have
a
small
plant
and
it's
making--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
but
the
reservist
is
going
to
be
there
for
five
days,
so
it's
not
clear
that
there's
any
difficulty
in
scheduling
him
for
those
five
days.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
he
treated
his
reserve
absences
just
as
if
they
were
personal
leaves
of
absence
for
whatever
reason--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
congress
has
enacted
a
special
statute
that
provides
for
special
treatment
of
reservists--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
treating
the
reservist
more
favorably.
the
end
result--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--what
we
contend
is
that
the
employer
has
to
give
special
treatment
to
the
absences.
the
statute's
not
satisfied
simply
by--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it's
not
permitted
to
treat
an
absence
for
reserve
duty
as
if
it
was
any
other
sort
of
absence.
now,
the
bottom
line
is
not
more
favorable
treatment
for
the
reservist.
he
ends
up
with
the
same
benefits
that
all
the
other
employees
have.
it's
just
the
recognition
by
congress
that
these
are
absences
that
the
reservists
have
no
control
over.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
it's
in
the
same
ball
park.
congress
has
specifically
put
it
in
a
special
category.
they've
asked
employers
to
take
certain
steps
so
that
people
are
not,
do
not
automatically
lose
benefits
in
their
civilian
employment
because
they
have
to
enter
into
this
military
service.
this
is
a
recognition
that
military
service
is
important
for
this
country
and
they
want
to
encourage
people
to
do
it,
not
be
discouraged.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
it's
quite
different
than
under
title
vii,
because
the
situation
under
title
vii,
it's
a
complete
anti-discrimination
statute
that
intends
to
prohibit
discrimination
against
all
groups
of
employees,
religious
being
one.
but
here
there
is
a
specific
statute
directed
at
military
absences.
so
i
think
that
there
may
be
some
more
accommodation
required
here
than
there
is
in
the
title
vii
problem.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
the
accommodation
is
just
statutorily
based.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
think
that
twa
v.
hardison
really
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
case.
first
of
all--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
for
several
reasons.
one,
the
statute
is
completely
different.
the
purposes
of
the
statute
are
quite
different.
i
mean,
here
you
have
a
specific
statute
aimed
at
a
particular
group
of
employees.
there
you
have
complete
anti-discrimination.
now,
you
have
to
recognize,
in
hardison
the
employee
himself
was
asking
for
preferential
treatment.
he
didn't
want
to
work
on
any
saturdays
at
all,
so
he
was
asking
for
a
schedule
that
was
better
than
what
the
other
employees
were
entitled
to,
even
though
those
employees
had
greater
seniority.
now,
here,
the
respondent's
just
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
work.
and
the
schedule
is
going
to
end
up
being
the
same,
in
the
final
analysis.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
are
two
different
sections
that
apply
to
reservists.
one
is
section
2024(d),
first
enacted
in
1960,
that
says
that
a
reservist
has
a
right
to
a
leave
of
absence
when
he
has
reserve
duty
and
when
he
returns
from
that
leave
of
absence
he's
entitled
to
be
restored
to
his
employment
with
the
same
seniority,
vacation,
et
cetera.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no
question
about
that
being
violated
here.
but
congress
had
enacted
an
additional
section,
several
years
later,
to
increase
the
protection
for
reservists,
and
in
that
section
the
statutory
language
is
that
"the
reservist
may
not
be
denied
retention
of
employment.
"
et
cetera
"or
other
incident
or
advantages
of
employment
because
of
his
reserve
obligations.
"
now,
in
its
literal
terms,
that
statute
has
been
violated
here.
both
courts
found
that
the
right
to
a
40-hour
work
week
at
the
refinery
was
an
incident
or
advantage
of
employment
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
right
to
work.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
right
to
work
40
hours
a
week
is
based
on
the
employer's
practice
at
this
particular
refinery.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
this
is
a
right
that
is
granted
to
employees.
employees
want
to
be
able
to
depend
upon
a
certain
amount
of
guaranteed
income.
i
mean,
the
right
to
a
40-hour
work
week
is
not
a
benefit
for
employers,
it's
a
benefit
for
employees.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
right
is
guaranteed
by
the
employer.
it
was
not
a
guarantee
of--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--by
custom
and
practice
at
the
refinery.
that's
a
factual
finding
by
both
courts
below.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he's
denied
meaningful
right
to
work
40
hours
a
week
because
of
his
reserve
status.
now,
it's
true
that
they
scheduled
him,
on
schedule,
for
40
hours,
but
they
scheduled
him
at
times
that
they
knew
he
could
not
work.
i'm
not
probably
responsive
to
the
questions
but
that's
not
a
meaningful--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--okay,
we're
not
asking
for
the
reservist
to
be
given
a
preference.
it's
hard
to
answer
completely
in
the
abstract
as
to
what
is
reasonable
or
not.
i
mean,
if
the
fact
that
other
employees
would
have
to
work
more
weekends,
or
if
it
might
interfere
with
some
seniority
system,
there
is
certainly
strong
evidence
that
it's
an
unreasonable
accommodation.
because,
i'm
just
reluctant
to
admit
that
there
might
be
some--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
we
absolutely
concede
that
he's
not
entitled
to
work
fewer
weekends
than
the
other
employees,
although
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
he
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
that's
clear,
as
far
as
it
goes;
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
you've
put
your
finger
on
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
he's
not
being
favored,
because
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to
go
fishing
either.
i
mean,
this
is
just
a
special
treatment
of
this
particular
category
of
absences
that
congress
has
mandated.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
requires
the
employer
to
treat
his
absences
differently.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
not
satisfied
by
treating
his
absences
like
other
absences.
i
still
maintain
that
the
bottom
line
as
to
what
the
reservist
gets
is
the
same.
he
works
the
same
number
of
weekends,
the
same
number
of
hours.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
that's
the
precise
analogy.
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
under
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
reemployment
rights
statutes
the
employer
is
not
entitled
to
treat
a
veteran's
absences
the
same
as
he
treats
absences
of--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--clearly
not.
our
contention
here
is
that
he
has
a
right
to
work
40
hours
during
the
week
when
he's
present
at
work.
now,
on
these
weekends
that
he
misses,
he's
there
at
work,
during
the
week,
for
five
days
of
the
week,
and
we're
just
asking
that
he
be
entitled
to
work
on
those
five
days.
now,
if
he's
gone
for
two
years,
he's
not
at
the
plant.
he
can't
work
40
hours
for
any
of
those
weeks.
so
he's
not
been
denied
that
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
excuse
me,
justice
blackmun.
there's
no
way
they
can
accommodate
him.
i'm
sorry;
go
ahead.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there's
no
official
union
presence.
i
mean,
i
think
union
employers
are
often
reluctant
to
give
these
benefits,
or
to
give
this
treatment
to
reservists
unless
they're
required
to
do
so
by
the
courts,
because
they're
a
little
concerned
that
the
unions
will
complain.
i
mean,
i
think
that
perhaps
explains
why
even
though
it
may
not
have
been
very
difficult
for
them
to
accommodate
the
reservists,
they
chose
not
to
and
chose
to
litigate
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
standard
oil
is
unionized?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
we
can
assume
that;
yes.
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved.
now,
this
case
is
basically
one
of
statutory
construction.
apart
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
i've
already
alluded
to,
there
are
several
principles
of
statutory
construction
this
court
has
established
under
the
veterans
provisions,
and
each
of
these
points
towards
petitioner's
construction
of
the
statute.
first,
it's
always
been
recognized
that
the
provisions
ought
to
be
given
liberal
construction
in
favor
of
the
veteran
or,
as
in
this
case,
the
reservist.
now,
despite
this
command,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
a
very
narrow
view
of
the
protection
here
because
there
was
no
clear
and
unambiguous
legislative
mandate
to
the
contrary.
this
rejection
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
to
be
a
plausible
interpretation
is
completely
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
established
as
the
rule
for
construing
the
statute.
secondly,
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
underlying
purpose
of
these
provisions,
and
that
is
that
servicemen
not
be
disadvantaged
by
serving
their
country,
to
the
extent
possible.
in
alabama
power
this
court
stated
this
principle
thusly:
"the
provisions
evidence
congress's
desire
to
minimize
the
destruction
in
individuals'
lives
resulting
from
military
needs.
"
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we
said
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
basis
for
such
a
claim,
unless
there
is
some
other
employment
benefit
i'm
not
aware
of.
but
on
this
benefit
we're
talking
about
in
this
case,
the
right
to
a
40-hour
work
week,
he
was
not
denied
that
right,
if
he's
gone
for
two
weeks.
if
he's
gone
for
a
whole
week,
there's
no
way
the
employer
can
schedule
him
for
40
hours
of
work
that
week,
so
he's
not
entitled
to
anything.
we're
not...
he's
just
asking
for
the
right
to
work,
he's
not
asking
to
be
paid
for
hours
that
he
does
not
work.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
situation
you're
talking
about.
if
there's
a
way
that
they
can
work
it
out,
that
he
can
work
the
hours,
then
he
has
a
claim.
if
there
isn't,
there
isn't.
now,
congress
enacted
this
statute
against
the
background
of
these
principles
of
construction
that
i've
discussed.
they
deliberately
enacted
the
statute
using
broad
language.
they
used
the
words,
"any
incident
or
advantage
of
employment.
"
and
they
used
the
words,
"that
the
reservist
shall
not
be
denied
these
benefits.
"
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
statute
be
interpreted
as
narrowly
as
it
has
been.
now,
i
think
the
waters
in
this
case
have
been
muddied
a
little
bit
by
the
facts,
which
as
i
pointed
out
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
are
not
really
at
issue
in
this
case.
perhaps
i
could
focus
the
issue
a
little
better
by
giving
you
different
examples.
let's
suppose
the
reservist
worked
at
a
store
where
each
employee
was
entitled
to
two
weekends
of
work
in
a
given
month
at
double
pay,
and
the
employer
has
historically
divided
the
weekends
on
an
alphabetical
basis.
those
employees
in
the
first
half
of
the
alphabet
work
on
the
first
and
third
weekends
of
each
month,
those
in
the
second
half
of
the
alphabet
worked
on
the
second
and
fourth
weekends
of
each
month.
now,
mr.
andrews,
who
works
at
the
store,
joins
the
reserves
and
now
has
an
obligation
to
attend
reserve
duty
on
the
third
weekend
of
those
months.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
employer
has
a
duty,
since
it
is
no
trouble
for
him
at
all,
to
schedule
andrews
on
the
second
and
the
fourth
weekend
of
those
months
and
schedule
someone
else
on
the
first
and
the
third
weekends,
even
though
that
violates
his
long-established
rule
of
how
he
allocates
the
weekends.
the
court
of
appeals
position
is
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
rely
on
his
rule.
the
rule
is
facially
neutral,
does
not
discriminate
against
reservists,
and
therefore
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
for
him.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
you're
suggesting
this
one
month
reserve
duty
falls
in
july,
for
example,
and
that's
when
he's
scheduled
for
vacation?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
not
sure
what
employment
benefit
he's
being
denied
if
his
reserve
duty
comes
out
on
his
vacation.
i
mean,
that's
the
optimum
situation,
that's
the
idea
that
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
he
can't...
well,
let
me
backtrack.
i
think
he--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
doesn't
even
really
raise
the
issue,
i
think,
that's
presented
here,
because
section
2024(d)
guarantees
him
a
leave
of
absence
and
guarantees
that
he
can
come
back
with
his
vacation
intact.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
that's
right;
it
doesn't
guarantee
that
he'll
be
paid.
but
if
he
comes
back
at
the
end
of
july
he
will
still
be
entitled
to
vacation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
all
right,
assuming
that
it
can
be
accommodated,
now--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
it's
just
a
reasonableness
test.
it's
hard
to
identify
in
the
abstract.
i
mean,
certainly
the
fact
that
they
had
to
do
a
little
extra
work,
change
from
a-to-m
to
n-to-z.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
just
has
a
right
to
the
same
benefit--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--he
can't
say
that
i
want
to
have
my
first
and
third...
the
same
as
any
other
employee.
if
he
has
any
reason
that
he
wants
his
vacation
in
july,
it's
too
bad.
but
if
it
conflicts,
if
it's
because
it
conflicts
with
his
reserve
obligation,
then
he
does
have
a
right
not
to
have
the
benefit
denied
to
him.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
congress
has
guaranteed
him
these
employment
benefits
to
the
extent
that
if
they
can
be
accommodated.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
have
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
that
reservists
cannot
be
denied
these
benefits.
now,
we
are
willing
to
admit
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
employers
need
to
take
unreasonable
measures
in
order
to
assure
employees
these
benefits--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
the
statute
imposed
a
duty
on
the
employer.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
an
absolute
duty;
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there's
an
absolute
duty.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
another
portion
of
the
statute
the
congress
made
clear
in
2021(a)
that
it
did
not
require
the
employer
to
take
unreasonable
measures.
that's
in
connection
with
reinstating
veterans.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
this
is
at
the
end.
well,
it's
not
reprinted,
because
it's
not
germane
to
this
case,
but
in
fact,
there's
a
specific
statement
in
the
statute
that
employers
are
not
required
to
reinstate
veterans
where
it
will
be
unreasonable
or
unduly
burdensome
to
do
so,
and
we--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--he's
entitled
to
40
hours
a
week,
to
work
40
hours
a
week.
but
if
it's
impossible
for
him
to
work
40
hours
that
week,
it's
recognized
that
congress
wouldn't
haven't
intended
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
everybody's
entitled
to
40
hours
a
week.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
not
in
this
case,
it's
not
impossible.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
sure,
it's
impossible--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
if
he's
gone
for
the
whole
week,
it's
impossible
to
schedule
him
to
work
40
hours
during
that
week.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
that's
not
giving
him...
the
employment
benefit
is
the
right
to
work,
not
the
right
to
be
paid
for
not
working.
we're
just
saying
that
he's
entitled
to
be
given
the
employment
benefit
at
issue,
which
is
working
for
40
hours.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
and
i
think
a
lot
of
discussion
here
has
completely
ignored
the
fact
that
congress
passed
this
statute,
2021(b)(3).
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
the
respondent
indicated
that
the
reservist
has
only
certain
limited
rights,
and
those
are
the
rights
that
are
guaranteed
by
2024(d).
there
is
another
statute
here
and
respondent
will
either
have
us
ignore
this
statute
or
restrict
it
to
discharges,
which
is
plain
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
it's
not
restricted
to
discharge
or,
as
the
court
of
appeals
so
narrowly
construed
the
statute
as
to
make
it
almost
meaningless.
and
they
did
that
by--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
statute
has
to
be
construed
in
line
with
what
we
think
congress's
intent
would
be.
now,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
this
entire
statute
is
to
be
read
together
as
one
piece.
now,
there
is
this
unreasonability
requirement
in
another
part
of
the
statute.
they
didn't
specifically
repeat
it
in
this
particular
amendment,
but
it's
reasonable
to
assume
the
congress
would
have
thought
the
same
thing;
the
same
policies
applied.
the
policy,
as
to
reservists...
inequality
in
employment
be
minimized.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
other
words,
if
he
has
a
two-week
vacation
with
pay,
generally,
and
then
he
takes
these
two
weeks
off
on
reserve
duty.
he's
not
required
to
count
those
two
weeks
as
his
two
weeks'
vacation.
he
takes
the
two
weeks
off,
he's
not
paid
for
these
two
weeks.
and
then
later
he
could
take
his
vacation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes;
assuming
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
without
pay.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
some
pay.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
doesn't
get...
it
doesn't
go;
it's
not
the
same
pay.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
may
be
away
a
total
of
a
month,
yes.
he's
entitled
to
take
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
mean,
the
veterans
reemployment
or
the
statutes
in
general
are
administered
by
the
department
of
labor.
