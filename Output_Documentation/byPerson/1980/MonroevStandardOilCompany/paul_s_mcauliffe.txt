mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
during
the
course
of
an
average
year
each
hourly
employee
at
sohio's
petroleum
refinery
in
lima,
ohio,
will
have
seven
weekends
scheduled
off
from
work,
during
that
year.
for
the
other
45
weekends
of
the
calendar
year,
that
employee
will
be
scheduled
to
work:
on
30
of
those
weekends
working
both
saturday
and
sunday;
on
the
other
15
working
one
or
the
other.
there
is
a
reason
why
life
appears
to
be
so
draconian
at
the
refinery,
and
that
is
because,
like
most
petroleum
refineries
and
like
many
other
workplaces
in
this
country,
the
refinery
operates
seven
days
a
week,
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
a
year.
that
means
that
on
every
weekend
a
full
operating
work
force
is
required
to
run
that
refinery.
if
weekends
were
staffed
on
a
voluntary
basis,
in
most
cases
there
would
be
serious
practical
problems
getting
a
full
on
a
weekend.
for
that
reason
sohio
has
developed
at
this
refinery,
subject
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
exists
with
the
oil,
chemical,
and
atomic
workers,
a
system
of
routine
rotating
scheduling
of
weekend
work
on
an
involuntary
basis.
under
this
system,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record,
every
employee
will
have
on
the
average
seven
weekends
off
per
year,
that
i
have
mentioned.
in
this
case
we're
dealing
with
one
of
these
employee's
who
was
a
member
at
the
time
in
question
of
the
ohio
national
guard.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
well,
first,
in
response
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
this
schedule
itself
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
and
was
part
of
the
stipulation,
and
you
can--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--pages
29
through
39.
if
you
go--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--if
you
go
through
the
rotation
scheme
in
there,
you
will
find
it
works
out
on
the
average
to
seven
weekends
off
per
year.
but
the
difficulty
in
rescheduling
is
the
fact
that
even
to
just
shift
one
day
at
a
time
on
a
weekend,
you
are
requiring
another
employee
who
would
otherwise
have
had,
say,
the
saturday
off,
to
work
on
that
saturday.
and
then--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--that's
correct.
and
we--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides,
whenever
the
regular
work
schedule,
whenever
an
employee
has
a
conflict,
he
can
change
voluntarily.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
given
the
facts
we
have
in
this
case,
that
could
be
done,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
number
of
days,
if
we're
talking
about,
12
months,
24
days,
the
total
number
of
weekend
days
off
he
would
normally
have
would
be
29,
so
we're
talking
about
a
redistribution
of
his
weekend
days
as
well
as
the
days
of
the
other
employees.
as
a
practical
matter,
in
most
cases,
we'll
be
talking
about
more
than
the
24
days,
because
the
reservist
will
also
be
gone
for
two
weeks
for
the
summer
training
camp
obligation.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
so
you
might
be
able
to
accomplish
it
by
juggling
the
days
around.
you're
still--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--no,
no,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
he'd
be
working
more
days.
their
distribution
would
be
different.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
the
total
number
during
the
course
of
the
year
could
be
set
up
so
that
the
number
of
days,
enough
days,
would
be
the
same.
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
i
think
it's
in
keeping
with
the
statute
when
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute
and
at
the
workplaces
of
this
facility.
first
of
all,
we're
talking
about
sohio
having
taken
the
specific
steps
that
were
required
by
the
statute
to
grant
a--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
and
we
contend
that
that--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--the
steps
that
were
taken
were
the
steps
taken
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
calling
for
voluntary
exchanges.
other
than
that,
no
steps
were
taken
to
rearrange
the
schedule.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
true,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
we
contend
that
there
was
no
obligation.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
i
missed...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
what
we
see
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
problems
of
somebody
who
is
in
effect
holding
two
different
jobs.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
full-time
employee
at
sohio's
lima,
ohio,
refinery,
and
has
certain
rights
and
obligations
that
go
with
that
status
of
being
an
employee.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
not
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
congress
has
and
congress
has
enacted
very
specific
accommodation
requirements
that--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--i
assume
that
they
did,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
no,
i
don't
think
so.
but
what
congress
has
done
with
regard
to
the
reserves
is
to
create
very
specific
special
rights
to
accommodation
that
do
not
exist
for
other
employees.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
the
right
that
congress
has
created
is,
first,
the
right
when
there
is
a
conflict
to
relieve
this
employee
of
his
obligation
to
work
his
regular
schedule
and
to
grant
that
employee
a
leave
of
absence,
to
reinstate
that
employee
at
the
termination
of
that,
and
to
protect
his
seniority,
his
status,
just
as
you
would
have
to
do
for
someone
who
was
in
the
regular
military.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
when
he
is
away?
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
while
he's
away,
you
fill
the
job
on
a
temporary
basis
and
that
can
be
done--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--there
are
two
methods
that
were
used
at
this
workplace.
one
would
be
to
assign
an
employee
if
one
is
available
from
a
floating
crew
called
"the
extra
board"
at
the
facility
who
would
not
have
a
regular
schedule
and
who
would
be
available
to
fill
temporary
vacancies.
that
person
would
then
work
that
day
or
two
days,
as
the--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--that's
correct.
if
no
one
were
available
from
that
crew,
then
you
would
fill
it
as
an
overtime
job.
under
this
agreement
it
has
to
be
voluntary.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that
would
cost
premium
pay;
time
and
a
half.
the
rearrangement
of
schedules
that
the
government
is
suggesting
in
this
case
would
require
us
to
take
an
employee
in
the
same
classification
as
petitioner,
require
him
to
work
that
particular
weekend
instead,
still
at
his
regular
pay,
no
premium
pay,
because
everybody
is
still
just
working
a
40-hour
week
under
this
theory.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
vacancy
is
filled
now
under
the
provisions
of...
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct.
in
some
cases
there
may
be
some
premium
pay
involved
but
that
wasn't
done
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
well,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
the
right
to
seniority
that
is
protected
is
a
very
broad
right.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
there's
no
contention
here.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
yes,
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--the
wording
is
precisely
the
same
with
one
difference,
and
that
is
that
provisions
relating
to
reservists
also
use
the
word
"vacation",
because
there's
a
specific
protection
for
the
reservist
that
he
cannot
be
charged
any
vacation
time--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--i
don't
believe
so.
the
cases
under
the
veterans
reemployment
act
apply
to
veterans;
have
said
that
the
seniority
that's
protected
can
and
should
be
interpreted
when
you're
talking
about
seniority
to
protect
the
veteran,
or
in
this
case
the
reservist,
protect
that
absence,
give
them
protections
that
may
not
exist
elsewhere.
the
difference
between
our
position
and
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
we
freely
concede
that
the
leave
of
absence
is
to
be
treated
better,
and,
in
fact,
it
is,
because
of
the
leave
of
absence,
because
of
the
seniority
protection.
the
government's
argument
is
that
there
is
an
obligation
of
reasonable
accommodation
out
there
that
requires
even
more.
what
it
requires
is
that
the
work
schedule
be
changed
so
that
there
is
no
absence
at
all.
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
better
treatment,
should
there
be
an
absence.
we
freely
concede
that
that
is
required
by
this
court's
decisions
and
we
have
in
fact
done
that
in
this
case;
there
is
no
dispute
that
we
have
done
that.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
no,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
passage
which
mr.
justice
marshall
was
reciting
refers
to
the
version
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
government
relies,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reads
that
as
requiring
neutral
treatment.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
congress
passed
this
because
when
they
first
enacted
the
reinstatement
protection
for
reservist
in
1960
they
left
a
gap
in
protection,
when
you
compare
that
to
the
protection
they
had
already
provided
for
the
regular
military.
the
statutes
that
apply
to
the
regular
military
create
two
kinds
of
statutory
protection.
the
first
is
a
reinstatement
right
with
protection
of
seniority
and
status.
congress
enacted
that
for
reservists
in
24(d)
in
1960.
there
is
a
second
provision
of
the
statute
that
relates
to
the
regular
military
that
protects
them
against
discharge
without
cause
for
a
fixed
period
after
their
return
to
work.
the
reasons
for
that
being
to
prevent
the
case
where
a
veteran
would
be
reinstated,
given
full
seniority
protection,
and
then
once
that
had
been
done,
a
few
weeks
down
the
road
that
person
would
be
released
from
employment.
in
1960,
when
congress
specifically
extended
the
statute
to
the
reservists,
they
provided
no
comparable
protection,
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
that
led
to
the
passage
of
21(b)(3),
the
specific
concern
of
the
department
of
labor
in
proposing
the
legislation,
or
the
department
of
defense
in
supporting
it,
was
that
there
were
instances
of
employees
being
reinstated
after
having
exercised
their
reservist
rights
and
then
being
discharged
from
employment
or
denied
promotions
or
suffering
other
adverse
treatment.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct.
absent
21(b)(3),
there
would
be
no
protection
under
the
statute
in
that
case,
and
that's
the
reason
congress
enacted
it.
and
that
is...
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
that
was
their
purpose
and
this
comes
clear
as
well
if
you
look
at
the
interpretations
that
have
been
issued
under
the
statute
by
the
department
of
labor
from
that
time
to
this
date,
which
has
specifically
described
21(b)(3)
as
a
section
designed
to
protect
against
discharges,
protect
against
denials
of
promotion
or
other
discrimination.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
i
think
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
to
that
question
is
that
it
probably
would
and
i
answer--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--the
facts
are
that
the
scheduling
practice
that
has
been
followed
under
the
agreement
is
the
one
that's
set
forth
in
the
record.
there
never
has
been
any
attempt
to
follow
a
different
practice.
the
agreement,
while
it
may
be
silent
on
this
specific
work
schedules,
the
agreement
does
have
a
specific
mechanism
for
resolving
schedule
conflicts--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--yes,
sir.
there
is
a
union
at
this
facility.
it
is
local--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--no,
they
are
not.
the
union
has--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--well,
there
is...
the
union
is
not
a
party
to
this
litigation.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
i
suspect
that--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--it
certainly
would
be.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
it
could
have
been
done.
i
am
sure
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
do
that,
but
we're
facing
facts
where
we
know
that
solicitation
was
already
done
by
the
employee
affected
and
there
was
no
one
willing
to
exchange
on
a
voluntary
basis.
we
could...
as
we
read
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
place
here,
we
would
not
have
the
right
to
force
somebody
to
make
the
shift.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
at
the
time
in
question,
approximately,
i
think
it's
561
employees
at
this
time.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
the
record
is
silent
on
that
question
other
than
to
note
this
one
petitioner
involved
is
a
member
of
the
reserves.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
yes,
it
certainly
would
be.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
well,
you
run
into
the
answer
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
stevens
before,
what
will
work
in
the
case
of
one
employee
won't
work
as
you
get,
get
more
and
more,
perhaps,
more
and
more
employees
involved.
we
don't
have
any
specific
knowledge
in
the
record
of
this
case,
how
many
employees
are
affected.
i
think
in
terms
of
reading--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
no,
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
i
think
the
5th
circuit
holding
was
incorrect
and
also
that
the
logic
that
it
followed
in
getting
to
that
holding
was
incorrect.
that's
what
i'll--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--i
think
this
case
reflects
in
a
way
that
the
west
case
in
the
5th
circuit
does
not,
some
of
the
difficulties
with
trying
to
develop
an
accommodation
scheme,
because
you
do
have
a
fixed
schedule,
you
do
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
limits
flexibility
in
changing
that
schedule,
which
was
not,
at
least
not
in
the
record,
as
far
as
we
know
in
the--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--it
would
not.
it
would...
the
answer
to
that
question
would
depend
somewhat
upon
how
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
construed
and
whether
that
was
actually
construed
as
a
guarantee
of
40
hours
per
week,
a
guarantee
that
the
employer
would
assure
on
a
regular
basis
for
the
right--
mr.
paul
s.
mcauliffe
--that's
precisely
our
argument,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
principal
difference
in
reading,
in
our
reading
of
the
statute
and
the
reading
that
the
petitioner
urges,
does
come
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
requirement
that
applies.
it's
our
position
that
there
is
not,
and
that,
first,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
section
21(b)(3)
which
even
hints
at
there
being
a
reasonable
accommodation
requirement.
you
also
have
the
fact
that
in
another
section
of
the
same
statute
congress
spoke
very
specifically
to
what
types
of
accommodation
should
be
provided
when
you
have
a
conflict
between
a
reservist
schedule
and
a
regular
work
schedule.
i'm
referring
to
section
24(d).
you
also
have
a
very
clear
legislative
history
of
section
21(b)(3)
which
shows
that
its
purpose
was
to
protect
against
discriminatory
treatment.
we
submit
that
there's
no
basis
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
to
support
the
interpretation
that
the
government
has
urged
upon
you
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
reading
that
we
think
is
the
proper
reading
of
21(b)(3)
is
the
only
reading
that
is
consistent
with
the
structure
of
the
statute,
with
the
legislative
history,
with
the
administrative
guidance
that
employers
have
gotten
for
ten
years
from
the
department
of
labor
on
what
their
obligations
are,
as
well
as
the
best
reading
consistent
with
the
use
of
judicial
resources
to
reconcile
claims
of
what
may
or
may
not,
within
a
particular
set
of
facts,
be
reasonable
accommodation.
in
our
view
the
congress
in
24(d)
specifically
addressed
this
question,
and
gave
very
detailed,
specific,
and
workable
rules
for
employers
to
follow.
and
our
contention
is
that
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
sohio
has
met
all
of
its
obligations
with
regard
to
the
reserve
absence,
with
regard
to
the
need
to
provide
reinstatement
rights,
and
with
regard
to
21(b)(3)
and
its
protection
against
discriminatory
treatment.
i
thank
the
court.
