justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
why
you
don't
see
twa
v.
hardison
as
being
in
your
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't...
can
i
assume
that
standard
oil
has
a
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
your
admissions
you
say
that
the
defendant
took
no
steps
to
provide
plaintiff
with
substituted
work
hours.
no
effort,
no
steps,
rather;
no...
none.
not
even
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that's
in
keeping
with
the
statute,
to,
make
no
effort?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
admission,
"they
had
made
no
steps
to
provide
plaintiff
with
sixteen
substituted
working
hours
to
make
up
for
his
lost
work.
"
that's
all
that
it
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
means
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
even
ask
if
somebody
wanted
to
take
this
man's
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
under
the
collective
agreement
the
man
has
to
take
the
steps,
the
worker
has
to
make
the
steps.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
still
means
that
the
defendant
did
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
would
assume,
i
could
assume
there
were
ten
million
people
waiting
there
to
do
it,
if
they'd
just
ask.
justice
marshall
well,
you
can't
dispute
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
that
word
"no"
is
awfully--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
all
that
was
required
was
that
he
be
treated
exactly
like
everybody
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
they
said
over
and
over
again.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
all
the
findings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
a
party,
but
it's
in
the
findings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
paid
a
union
worker
a
single
salary
for
a
double
salary
job,
wouldn't
it
be
a
violation
of
the
union
contract?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
so.
i
wouldn't
advise
trying
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anybody
else
in
that
plant
entitled
to
40
hours
a
week?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
horowitz,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
i'm
not
entirely
clear
as
to
what
the
duty
is
with
respect
to
the
two
weeks'
summer
training
for
reservists.
does
the
reservist
have
a
right
not
only
to
be
absent
for
those
two
weeks
but
in
addition
to
have
his
two
weeks
vacation
with
pay,
so
he's
away
four
weeks
in
the
summer?
