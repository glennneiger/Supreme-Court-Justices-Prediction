justice
jr.
does
it
show
how
many
reservists
are
employed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
horowitz,
the
government's
position
is
that
only
reasonable
efforts
to
accommodate
the
needs
of
a
reservist
are
required
under
the
statute.
the
statute
itself
is
rather
positive,
isn't
it?
2021(b)(3)
provides
in
effect
that
any
person
who
holds
a
position
described
in
the
statute
shall
not
be
denied
other
incident
or
advantage.
do
you
interpret
that
to
require
only
reasonable
effort?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
he's
entitled,
i
suppose,
under
this
union
bargaining
contract,
as
in
most,
to
a
period
off
with
pay?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
a
reservist
entitled,
in
addition
to
that,
to
take
off
two
additional
weeks
to
fulfill
his
reserve
requirements--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--without
pay.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--the
result
is
he
may
be
away
a
month?
