justice
stevens
would
not
the
revenue
protection
rationale
apply
equally
to
the
door
slots?
justice
stevens
is
the
recipient
of
this
illegal
mail
guilty
of
any
offense?
justice
stevens
is
it
fair
to
infer,
mr.
kneedler,
that
the
clutter
problem
that
gave
rise
to
the
statute
maybe
hasn't
been
solved.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there's
any
less
clutter
after
the
statute
was
passed
than
before?
are
people
obeying
the
statute,
i
suppose
is
what
i'm
asking?
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
i
wasn't
familiar
with
that
part
that
you
called
my
attention
to,
about
all
the
requests
for
paying
postage
on
unmailable
matter.
does
the
record
tell
us
how
much
in
dollars
the
government
has
collected
in
that
manner?
justice
stevens
but
is
it
in
the
millions
of
dollars?
or
is
is
a
few
hundred?
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
one
procedural
question
now?
as
i
remember,
when
we
first
took
the
case
it
was
from
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
remanded
for
trial,
is
that
right?
or
did
we
take
it
directly
from
the
district
court?
justice
stevens
and
wasn't
your
appeal
from
that
order?
justice
stevens
from
the
district
court's
order
after?
justice
stevens
i
was
under
the
impression
we
had
taken
the
case
from
the
court
of
appeals'
remand
order
but
that's
incorrect?
justice
stevens
i
know
it
was
remanded,
but
i--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
the
construction
point
of
1696,
i
notice
the
next
sentence
of
the
statute
after
the
one
quoted
in
the
amicus
brief
says
that
whenever
more
than
25
such
letters
or
packets
are
conveyed
or
transmitted
by
such
special
messenger,
the
requirements
of
section
500,
title
39,
should
be
met.
were
they
more
than
25
letters
typically
delivered
by
these
young
people?
justice
stevens
the
exemption...
but
then
the
exemption
would
not
necessarily...
i
don't
know
what
title
39,
section
500,
is,
do
you
know
what?
justice
stevens
so
this
is
really
a
pretty
new
argument,
then,
isn't
it?
