justice
jr.
and
these
cluster
boxes
have
to
be
lockable,
do
they
not?
justice
jr.
there
has
to
be
a
key
on
them?
it
can't
be
one
that
you
just
pull
open?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
what
about
those
that
you
can
just
pull
open?
i'm
thinking
of
rural
delivery.
justice
jr.
they
don't
have
locks
on
them.
justice
jr.
everyone
drops
newspapers
and
everything
else
in
them.
justice
jr.
even
in
those?
even
though
they're
not
lockable?
justice
jr.
well,
what
are
non
lockable
bins
or
troughs
under
that
regulation?
justice
jr.
therefore,
i
take
it,
a
civic
association
that
drops
a
leaflet
on
that
trough
or
table
doesn't
violate
the
statute?
justice
jr.
now,
there's
one
other
thing,
mr.
kneedler,
i
gather.
this
statute
is
violated
only
when
the
deposit
is
of
mailable
matter?
justice
jr.
without
having
stamped
it?
justice
jr.
which
i
gather
would
not
include
pornographic
material,
for
example?
that's
not
mailable
matter,
is
it?
or
explosives,
or
snakes.
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
isn't
there
a
definition
in
the
statute
of
what
constitutes
mailable
matter?
justice
jr.
and
it
says
pornography
is
not
mailable
matter.
justice
jr.
so
i
gather
you
can
drop
that
in
without
violating
this
statute
at
least.
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
well,
that's
not
true
everywhere,
mr.
kneedler.
if
you've
ever
been
on
nantucket
island
you
will
discover
that
there's
only
one
box.
the
newspaper
and
everything
else
goes
into
it.
justice
jr.
and
it's
not
locked.
and
i
gather
that...
are
those
depositors
violating
this
statute?
justice
jr.
well,
when
i
get
up
there
this
summer
i'll
tell
them.
what
makes
you
think
we'll
return?
justice
jr.
are
there
many
prosecutions--
justice
jr.
getting
back,
mr.
kneedler,
to
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
i
gather
junk
mail
which
is
stamped,
if
stolen,
that's
a
crime,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
it
might
be
third
class
or
whatever
it
may
be,
but
if
it's
revenue
producing,
it
can
be
junk
mail
but
as
long
as
it's
been
revenue
producing,
whatever
the
rate
may
be,
its
theft
is
a
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
i'm
not
speaking
to
that.
i'm
speaking
only
to
that
which
is
stamped.
justice
jr.
lord
knows
all
of
us
get
a
lot
of
stamped
junk
mail--
justice
jr.
--it's
going
just
as
far
as
the
first
waste
paper
basket.
justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
hammer,
that
starts
out
with
"this
chapter".
is
that
the
chapter
that
includes
1725?
justice
jr.
does
that
affirmatively
appear
in
this
record
that
those
who
made
this
distribution--
justice
jr.
--are
volunteers
without
compensation?
justice
jr.
where?
justice
jr.
mr.
hammer,
who
is
e
payson
clark,
jr.?
justice
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
ask,
i
notice
at
page
38
of
the
transcript,
there's
his
testimony.
"now,
mr.
clark,
can
you
tell
us
in
terms
of
these
hand
distributions,
who
makes
them?
"
"the
people
who
make
them,
can
you
tell
us?
"
the
answer:
"the
people
who
are
active
in
the
affairs
of
the
civic
association,
of
which
i
am
only
one
representative,
go
from
door
to
door
and
insert
these
civic
community
notices
in
the
private
mailboxes
of
the
homeowners.
"
next
question:
"to
your
knowledge,
are
any
of
these
people
ever
paid?
"
answer:
"no
adult,
to
my
knowledge,
has
ever
asked
for
or
received
any
compensation
for
this
activity,
but
youngsters
in
the
community,
by
their
parents,
and
sometimes
possibly
from
the
civic
association,
would
be
given
50
cents
or
a
dollar
or
so,
a
little
family
stipend,
for
going
down
one
side
of
the
street
while
the
parent
is
working
the
other
side
of
the
street.
"
is
that
the
testimony
you're
talking
about?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know
the
youngsters
get
paid
though,
don't
they?
justice
jr.
is
that
the
only
testimony
we
have?
is
it--
justice
jr.
well,
i
suggest
one
thing,
mr.
hammer.
what
this
statute
says,
the
chapter
shall
not
prohibit
the
conveyance
or
transmission
of
letters
or
packets
by
private
hands
without
compensation.
it
doesn't
say,
shall
not
prohibit
the
deposit
in
mailboxes.
justice
jr.
i
gather
you
agree
you'd
have
a
stronger
argument
if
the
word,
"nor
deposit
in
mailboxes"--
justice
jr.
mr.
hammer,
you
suggested
earlier
that
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history,
i
thought
you
said,
could
be
limited
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
and
construction.
the
words,
statements
of
accounts,
i
guess
that's
just
the
ordinary
bills
i
get,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
circulars.
that's
rather
broad,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
are
you
suggesting
circulars
ought
to
be
limited
to
commercial
advertisements
and
that
sort
of
thing,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
well,
of
course,
this
is,
deposit
any
mailable
matter,
and
then
such
as...
in
other
words,
for
example.
isn't
that
right?
justice
jr.
how
about
election
circulars?
candidates?
has
the
statute
been
enforced
against
them?
