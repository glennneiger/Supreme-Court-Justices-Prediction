even
if
the
owner
says
to
the
carrier,
please
put
it
in
the
box,
it's
raining,
and
he...
the
consent
of
the
owner
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
violation?
justice
white
that's
easy.
but
what
if
you'd
just
as
soon
have
one
box?
then
that's
against
the
rules?
justice
white
well,
there's
no
general
prohibition
against
anybody
but
a
mailman
putting
anything
in
the
box?
i
take
it
this
statute
wouldn't
be
violated
if
somebody
put
a
stamp
on
it
and
delivered
it
himself?
justice
white
because,
just
because
he
doesn't
trust
the
postal
service
to
get
it
there.
justice
white
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
a
stamp
on
it?
justice
white
but
it
does
sort
of
undercut
the
notion
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
statute
is
that
it
clutters
up
the
mailbox.
you
can
clutter
it
up
as
much
as
you
want
if
you
put
a
stamp
on
it?
justice
white
but
still
part
of
your
argument
is
that
he
has
to
sort
it
out,
sort
out
this
stuff
that
is
dropped
in.
he
has
to
sort
that
out
from
the
outgoing
mail?
justice
white
that
part
of
it
is
not...
he'd
still
have
to
sort
out
the
mail?

justice

what
do
you
mean,
paid
for?
they
weren't
paid

then?
justice
white
who
does?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
executive
secretary,
the
paid
executive
secretary
of
one
of
them
did
it?
justice
white
well,
he's
just
on
a
salary.
this
just
happens
to
be
part
of
his
job.
justice

an
awful
lot
of
civic
associations
have
rather
large
staffs.
well,

isn't
exactly
a
poor
area,
is
it?
justice
white
--has
this
argument
ever
been
surfaced
in
this
case
before?
justice
white
--what
about
if
the
utility
company,
the
utility
company
hires
a
special
messenger
to
deliver
its
bills,
it
would
not
violate
the
statute
either
under
your
view
of--
justice
white
--well,
the
statute
says,
"or
by
special
messenger
employed
for
the
particular
occasion.
"
that's
your
very
same
statute
that
you're
relying
on.
justice
white
i
think
you
would.
you
would
have
to
read
it
some
way.
like
read
it
out.
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
what
this
statute
says.
justice
white
that's
the
only
one,
that
i
mentioned.
justice
white
well,
your
construction,
in
any
event...
if
you
win
this
case,
there
will
be

other
people
besides
civic

that
would
benefit?
