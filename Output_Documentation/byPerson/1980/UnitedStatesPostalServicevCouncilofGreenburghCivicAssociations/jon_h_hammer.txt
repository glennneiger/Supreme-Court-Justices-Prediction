mr.
jon
h.
hammer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
there
are
significant
first
amendment
issues
presented
by
this
case:
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--we
don't
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
rights
that
we
seek
to
assert
permit
us
to
invade
anybody's
sacred
rights
of
privacy.
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
rowan
indicates
that
the
homeowner
may
make
that
decision.
there
are
local
law
devices
such
as
no
trespassing
signs
and
things
of
that
nature
whereby
the
homeowner
can
preclude
any
type
of
distribution.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
i
think,
with
respect
to
the
mailbox,
the
answer
is
yes,
<mister>
[=
mr.]
chief
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
correct.
i
believe
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
yes.
i
believe,
however,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
nonconstitutional
issues
if
the
court
sees
fit.
and
i
would
like
to
allude
to
that
briefly.
my
adversary
indicated
in
referring
to
1725,
the
various
provisions
of
the
statute;
but
he
did
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
it
requires
an
intent
to
avoid
the
payment
of
the
postage,
an
intent,
a
criminal
statute
requiring
intent.
the
companion
section
of
this
chapter,
18
usc
1696,
provides
an
exemption
to
the
private
express
statute
which
permits
an
uncompensated
individual
to
deliver
mail--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--the
statute
is
18
usc,
section
1696.
i
believe
it's
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
amici,
of
the
civil
liberties
union,
at
page
21,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
green.
and
i
believe
that
that
section
provides
that
in
effect
a
noncompensated
volunteer
may
deliver
postage,
may
deliver
matter.
if
that
is
the
case,
anybody
distributing
material
under
1725--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--yes,
it
is.
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it's
the
same
chapter.
and
our
argument
is
that
if
there
is
no
need
to
require
the
payment
of
postage
for
a
noncompensated
individual,
how
can
he
possibly
under
1725
have
the
intent
to
avoid
the
payment
of
postage
if
no
postage
is
required?
i
believe
that
the
record
is
clear
that
the
civic
individuals
in
this
case,
and
all
those
such
as
the
amici
and
the
representative
civic
groups
throughout
the
united
states,
and
we
believe
that
we
are
representative
of
them,
are
volunteers
acting
without
compensation.
so
i
submit
that
1725--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--are
volunteers
without?
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
i
believe
that
is
in
the
appendix.
i'm
not
certain,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
i
can
cite
you
to
the
direct
page,
but
i
believe
that
the
testimony
of
numerous
civic
experts
indicated
that
none
of
these
individuals
were
ever
paid,
and
that
is
the
normal
procedure
for
civic
associations
in
terms
of
their
modus
operandi.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
what
we
have
tried
to
do
in
this
action,
even
though
we
could
not
bring
a
class
action
for
logistical
purposes...
the
problems
were
too
great,
that
the
testimony
of
the
civic
representatives
who
testified
in
this
case
were
not
simply
from
sawmill
valley
or
from
greenburgh.
they
were
from
other
areas,
connecticut,
new
jersey,
white
plains,
queens--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--yes.
and
in
addition,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
prior
court
of
appeals
proceeding,
which
was
remanded
back,
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
you
point
out,
there
were
affidavits
submitted
in
that
case
from
civic
representatives
in
new
hampshire
and
in
colorado
who
testified,
this
is
the
common
procedure,
the
way
it
is
pursued
throughout
the
united
states.
so
i
believe,
even
though
we
have
not
obtained
testimony
from
civic
representatives
from
50
states,
we
have
obtained
testimony
from
representative
groups
of
civic
associations.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
they
do
it
as
a
voluntary
service
to--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--the
members
of
the
civic
associations,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
then,
mr.
justice,
the
provisions
of
section--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--that...
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be,
in
an
affluent
area,
there
might
be
such
a
paid
executive,
although
we--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--it's
a
middle
class
area,
mr.
justice,
and
i
might
state
that
it
has
an
average
treasury
that
runs
approximately
150.
its
family
dues
are
about
$2
to
$5
per
year.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
mr.
justice,
in
the
town
of
greenburgh,
which
is
within,
the
sawmill
valley
is
included
within,
there
are
upper
income
areas,
there
are
middle
income
areas,
and
there
are
lower
income
areas.
indeed,
in
my
own
civic
association,
there
is
a
public
housing
project
of
people
who
are
required
to
be
of
low
income.
those
people
pay
no
dues
to
out
civic
association
because
they
cannot
afford
to
pay
any
dues,
even
$2
to
$5
a
year.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
e
payson
clark,
jr.,
mr.
justice,
is
sitting
here
at
the
counsel
table.
he
is
an
attorney.
he
was
a
civic
representative
in
the
town
of
greenburgh--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
thank
you,
mr.
justice
for--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--that's
true,
they
might.
sometimes,
it's
a
family
necessity,
mr.
justice,
to
make
this
payment.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
are
testimony
from
other
civic
representatives,
not
all
of
which
is
included
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
all
of
which
is
obviously
included
in
the
trial
transcript,
from
other
civic
associations,
in
other
areas,
that
people
never
receive
any
compensation
of
any
material
nature
other
than
these
de
minimis
payments,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
the
question
about
payment?
or
this
particular?
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
obvious
that
it
was
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
that
came
up
on
the
court's
motion,
granting
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that
statute?
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
it
doesn't
have
any,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
it's
just
that
i
was
attempting
to
give
the
court
a
possible
basis
for
determining
this
case
on
nonconstitutional
grounds.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
because
the
private
express
statute
exemptions
state
that
a
person
may
deliver
if
he
receives
no
compensation.
and
if
he
receives
no
compensation,
and
if
he
may
thereby
deliver,
how
under
the
section
which
is
before
the
court
may
he
have
an
intent
to
avoid
the
postage?
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
it
would
seem,
as
a
matter
of
logic
and
common
sense,
that
if
it
says,
you
may
transport
or
convey,
that
would
imply
that
you
would
have
to
convey
it
to
the
place
where
the
homeowner
may
be
likely
to
receive
it,
and
the
entire
frame
of
testimony
in
this
case
was
such
that
the
only
logical
appropriate
traditional
historical
place
where
homeowners
could
expect
to
receive
these
public
interest
civic
distributions--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--that's
true.
it
would
be
much
stronger
in
that
case,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
he
would
be
compensated,
mr.
justice--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--yes,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
have
to
read
that
as
meaning--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
i
would
have
to
assume
that
the
statutory
intendment
was
to
provide
that
this
special
messenger
was
to
be
compensated.
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
in
that
case.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
this
statute
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
i
think
1725
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
i
think
the
questions
with
respect
to
slots
created
ambiguity,
both
at
the
course
of
trial
where
one
government
witness
testified
it
was
covered
by
the
statute
and
one
testified
it
was
not.
the
post
office
issued
post
trial
regulations
deleting
the
problem
of
the
slot.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
state
this.
i
think
the
answer
is
probably
yes,
but
i
think
that
it's
clear
from
the--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--no,
i
think
you're
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
would
state
this,
that
we
are
dealing
here
not
with
commercial
distributions
but
with
the
core
first
amendment
distributions
of
political,
civic,
and
community
minded
information.
the
type
of
information
upon
which--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--in
terms
of
reliability
of
delivery,
yes.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what...
i
think--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--that's
correct.
and
i
would
have
two
answers
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is
a
statutory
construction
point.
i
think
that
the
provisions
of
this
statute
which
refer
to
circulars,
statements
of
account,
and
sale
bills,
and
the
legislative
history
confirms
this,
indicate
that
this
statute
was
intended
in
1934
to
cover
only
commercial
material,
not
noncommercial
material.
i
think
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
indicates
that.
and
this
court
could
determine
this
issue
without
regard
to
the
questions
of
commercial
distributions.
that's
one
answer,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
second
answer
is
that
i
think
that
this
court
in
the
cases
last
term,
the
consolidated
edison
case
and
the
central
hudson
case,
indicate
that
even
though
commercial
distributions
do
have
a
first
amendment
right
and
i
believe
that
the
trend
of
the
decisions
in
this
court
confirms
that,
there
is
still
a
greater
degree
of
protection
necessarily
afforded
to
noncommercial
distributions:
the
political,
civic,
and
public
interest
material
which
we
seek
to
distribute,
which
the
amici
seek
to
distribute,
and
which
all
the
representative
civic
groups
throughout
the
united
states
seek
to
distribute.
i
believe
that
the
compelling
government
interest,
if
any,
which
the
post
office
seeks
to
assert
here,
is
not
well
taken.
they
assert
a
loss
of
revenue,
and
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
if
a
person
can
deposit,
or
distribute
as
a
volunteer
under
1696,
regardless
of
how
ambiguous
that
statute
may
be,
then
there
cannot
be
any
concern
for
loss
of
revenue.
in
the
second
case,
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
there
has
been
wholesale
violation
of
this
statute
for
many
years.
we
don't
claim
any
invidious
discriminatory
nonenforcement,
but
the
trial
judge
took
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
this
statute
appears
to
be
more
honored
in
the
breach
than
in
the
enforcement
since
its
enactment
in
1934.
and
if
that
be
the
case,
then
i
think
there
is
very
little
possibility
of
any
revenue
or
adverse
revenue--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
read
into
the
minds
of
the
trial
court,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
only
in
view
of
the
fact
that--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
i
think
judge
conner
gave
it
serious
thought
but
he
also
based
it
on
the
testimony
in
the
case,
because
he
commented
that
people
testified
before
him
that
for
a
period
of
many
years
they
had
been
violating
this
statute,
knowingly
and
out
of
necessity.
in
fact,
the
appellee
council
of
greenburgh
civic
associations
knowingly
violated
this
statute
in
order
to
distribute
public
interest
material
on
a
referendum.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
of
necessity,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
turns
on
the
question
of
dollars
and
cents.
i
think
that
if
we
are
to
enforce
this
statute,
and
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
enforce
this
statute,
the
practical
first
amendment
for
the
great
mass
of
the
citizenry
who
seek
to
become
involved
in
their
community,
who
seek
to
exercise
their
rights
as
citizens,
to
become
involved
in
the
civic
and
political
process,
which
i
think
are
commingled
as
one,
would
be
denied.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
no,
mr.
justice,
i
would
not
make
that
point
and
i
would
not
submit
that
that
is
our
point.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
we
do
not
ask
to
utilize
the
postal
facilities.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
not...
i
state
that
financial
considerations
are
a
crucial
consideration,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
terms
of
considering
whether
this
court
shall
deprive
individual
citizens
and
civic
groups
of
their
only
practical
historical
means
of
distribution.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that
indigent
individual
can
do
as
our
civic
appellees
can
do,
he
can...
as
we
submit
they
should
be
able
to
do...
he
can
take
that
distribution
and
deposit
it
in
the
recipient's
mailbox
if
it
is
a
public
interest
civic
or
political
distribution.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
mr.
justice,
we
were
somewhat
encumbered
with
the
question
of
economics
and
logistics
in
proceeding
to
trial,
but
as
i
mentioned
previously,
there
were
affidavits
on
the
previous
summary
judgment
proceedings
from
a
civic
representative
from
the
vicinity
or
denver,
colorado.
so
we
did--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--that
was...
yes.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
yes,
sir.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--i
think
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is,
yes.
i
think
if
we
proceed
on
the
normal
statutory
construction
principles,
in
this
case
the
principle
of
noscitur
a
sociis,
that
language
is
known
by
the
company
it
keeps.
i
believe
that
it
clearly
indicates
that
statements
of
account--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
that
gets
into
the
gist
of
generis
concept,
which
i
think
leads
to
the
same
conclusion,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
it
should
be
commercial
only.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
which
is
before
this
court
indicates
that
the
reason
this
statute
was
enacted
was
because
utility
companies
in
the
1930s
were
using
this
as
a
device
to
distribute
their
bills.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
record
of
any
civic
violations,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
appendix
which
shows
that
there
has
never
been
any
record
of
a
civic
association
violation
of
this
statute
until
the
enforcement
threats
which
precipitated
this
litigation.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
i
believe
that
it
has
in
a
happenstantial
fashion,
mr.
justice
white.
in
other
words,
there
have
been
evidences--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--i
would
believe
that
all
noncommercial
public
interest
and
civic
oriented
material,
which
would
include
certainly
political
candidates,
because
we--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--under
virginia
board?
yes,
they
are,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
believe
that
under
the
central
hudson
case
there
is
still
an
indication
by
this
court,
and
in
the
opinion,
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
powell,
that
the
commercial
first
amendment
rights
are
still
of
a
lower
priority,
and
entitled
to
a
lesser
degree
of
constitutional
protection
than
these
rights
which
we
are
now
arguing
before
this
court.
i
believe
that
commercial
entities
have
the
financial
wherewithal
and
the
financial
desire
to
find
alternative
means
of
distribution.
we
have
none--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--no,
it
does
not,
but
but
i
believe
that
in
construing
a
statute
under
the
first
amendment,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
have
to
look...
and
we
don't
maintain
that
the
statute
is
facially
invalid...
the
statute,
the
government
argues,
is
content
neutral.
and
that
is
a
label
that
they
seek
to
attribute
to
it.
but
i
submit
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
in
terms
of
its
practical
application,
the
practical
realities
of
how
it
is
applied.
the
particular
environment
to
which
i
believe
this
court
referred
in
tinker
v.
des
moines
school
district,
that
i
think
is
the
threshold
question
which
this
court
has
to
answer.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
we
are
denied,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--mr.
chief
justice,
throughout
the
course
of
the
trial
and
as
a
result
of
the
remand
from
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit,
which
asked
the
trial
court
to
go
into
these
questions,
a
great
deal
of
the
testimony,
perhaps
almost
90
percent
of
it,
from
the
civic
association
side,
was
taken
up
with
exploring
these
alternative
devices,
and
civic
experts
from
a
great
variety
of
areas,
admittedly
not
west
of
the
hudson
except
in
one
case,
showed
that
these
other
methods
were
not
practicably
feasible.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well,
except--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--two
answers,
i
might
submit,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
first
case,
these
civic
experts
were
individuals
who
had
spent
a
great
part
of
their
adult
lives
on
weekends
and
on
various
times
in
the
community
distributing
materials
and
considering
alternatives.
they
found
these
other
alternatives--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
i
believe
probably
judicial
experts
are
forced
to
work
on
weekends.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
well--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--well,
i
meant,
mr.
justice,
that
the
distributions
of
this
type
of
material
is
generally
done
on
weekends
because--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--no,
no,
mr.
justice,
except--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--we
state
that
noncommercial
distributions
are
not
covered
by
the
statute.
that's--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--i
believe
it
is
there,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
the
statutory
construction
issue,
in
terms
of
commercial
noncommercial,
was
alluded
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
on
remand.
the
district
judge
did
not
consider
it
after
the
trial.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that
may
well
be,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
would
certainly
hope
that
this
court
would
be
able
to
provide
the
district
court
with
some
guidance,
perhaps
as
to
the
construction
of
the
statute.
i
would
also
like
to--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--in
some
cases
there
might
be.
in
many
cases
a
young
person
might,
or
with
a
parent
might
cover
ten
or
twelve
homes
on
a
particular
block
or
a
particular
street.
a
particular
civic
association--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--i
do
not,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
yes,
it
is,
and
i--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--yes,
it
was,
mr.
justice--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--yes.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
for
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
we
raised
the
statutory
construction
argument,
commercial
as
opposed
to
noncommercial.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
not
that
one.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
chief
justice's
comments
before
i
conclude,
about
the
civic
experts.
the
trial
judge
specifically
made
findings
of
fact
with
respect
to
these
alternative
means
of
delivery,
and
he
found
they
were
not
viable
methods
of
delivery.
i
believe
that
under
rule
52
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
we
should
accept
these
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
and
i
believe
that
much
of
our
brief
was
devoted
to
that
discussion.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
they
are
not
only
not
clearly
erroneous,
they
are
clearly
supported
by
every
piece
of
evidence
that
was
submitted.
because
the
post
office
submitted
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
not
when
a
statute
has
been
the
subject
of
wholesale
violation
for
a
period
of
40
years
or
45
years
since
its
enactment,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
the
authority
for
that
is
the
testimony
of
the--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--there's...
i
don't
believe
there's
anything
in
our
brief
to
cover
that.
it
was
a
factual
point
that
was
brought
out--
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
--i
don't
have
one
at
my
fingertips,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
i
concede
there
is
no
doctrine
of
laches
against
the
united
states
of
america
or
even
against
the
united
states
postal
service.
but
i
would
submit
also
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
case
in
its
cumulative
effect.
the
cumulative
effect
of
this
case
is
to
deny
distributions
under
the
first
amendment,
the
core
distributions
under
the
first
amendment.
the
participatory
democracy
which
is
essential
if
the
average
citizen
is
to
have
any
say
and
any
responsibility
in
the
operations
of
his
governments,
and
i
submit
that
if
this
method
is
denied,
the
facts
demonstrate
that
there
are
no
alternatives,
that
there
are
no
effective
alternatives
except
the
alternatives
which
are
available
by
reason
of
the
dollar,
and
i
submit
that
is
not
feasible.
i
see
my
time
is
concluded.
thank
you.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
was
a
permanent
injunction
that
was
entered.
there
was
no
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
jon
h.
hammer
that's
correct;
that's
correct.
