side
by
side,
one
has
a
"mail
box"
on
it
like
the

a
mail

be?

the
difference
be?

you
want
in

couldn't

anything

justice
marshall
--doesn't
anybody
move
around
at
election
time
and
see
four
and
five
things
stuck
in
people's
mailboxes?
i
mean,
you're
losing
a
lot
of
money.
you
could
lock
them
up.
i
mean,
any
election
time
you
get
four
and
five
every
day.
justice
marshall

that
in

marshall

people
get
paid.
justice
marshall
i
don't
think
so.

marshall

was
the
basis
for
that
judicial
notice?
or,
i
should
say,
what
if
any?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
what
did
he
say?
did
he
give
any
basis
for
it?
justice
marshall
or
did
it
come
out
of
the
clear
blue?
justice
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
other
expert
that
only
works
on
weekends?

marshall
i
said,

people
got
their
expertise
on
weekends.
justice
marshall
aren't
you
really
asking
for
an
exception
to
the
statute?
justice
marshall
well,
what
do
you
call
it?
justice
marshall
if
that
had
been
written
into
the
statute,
it
would
be
all
right?
