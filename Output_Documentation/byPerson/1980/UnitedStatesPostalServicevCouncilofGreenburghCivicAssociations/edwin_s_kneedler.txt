mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
that
court
held
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellees
an
act
of
congress
governing
the
deposit
of
materials
into
letter
boxes
used
by
the
postal
service
for
the
delivery
of
united
states
mail.
the
statutory
provision
involved
is
section
1725
of
title
18,
united
states
code.
that
section
prohibits
the
knowing
and
willful
deposit
of
any
mailable
matter
on
which
postage
has
not
been
paid
into
a
letter
box
that
has
been
established
by
the
postal
service
or
has
been
accepted
or
approved
by
the
postal
service
for
the
receipt
or
delivery
of
mail
along
any
mail
route.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
general,
the
boxes
are
furnished
by
the
mail
customer
but
the
postal
service
regulations
require
the
furnishing
of
an
appropriate
receptacle
for
the
receipt
of
mail
as
a
condition
to
the
delivery
of
mail--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
the
customer's
expense.
there
are
circumstances,
i
am
informed
by
the
postal
service,
in
which
the
postal
service
itself
will
construct
letter
boxes.
this
is
a
program
of
relatively
recent
origin.
it
occurs
particularly
in
new
subdivisions
where
the
builder
has
perhaps
neglected
to
put
in
what
are
called
cluster
boxes,
which
are
groups
of
boxes
at
the
end
of
the
block
to
serve
all
the
houses
up
the
block.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
postal
service
will
pay
for
those
letter
boxes
because
there
occasionally
have
been
disputes
as
to
whether
the
builder
or
the
homeowners
or
whoever--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
postal
service
has
the
keys;
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
the
owner
would...
the
person
to
whom
the
mailbox
pertains
would
only
have
a
key
to
his
own
individual
piece
of
the
box.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
the
cluster
boxes...
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
they
don't.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
under
the
statute,
other
persons
are
not
permitted
to
deposit
other
materials
into
those
boxes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
yes,
this
statute
applies
to
boxes,
whether
they
are
locked
or
unlocked.
it
applies--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
non
lockable
bins
and
troughs
are
really
a
very
narrow
category
of
situations.
it
occurs
in
apartment
buildings
where
there
is
frequently
a
line
of
boxes,
one
for
each
individual
apartment,
where
letters
are
received.
but
if
the
carrier
brings
larger
parcels
that
won't
fit
into
the
box,
then
they
are
frequently
deposited
in
a
trough
or
occasionally
on
a
table
to
be
picked
up
by
the
customer,
much
as
a
letter
carrier
might
leave
a
package
on
someone's
stoop
if
it
was
otherwise
protected,
or...
even
though
it
won't
fit
in
the
mailbox,
it
can
still
be
delivered.
so
that
is
not
regarded
as
a
receptacle
or
a
letter
box.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
in
this
case,
in
fact,
that
several
civic
associations
had
left
leaflets
on
the
trough
or
on
tables
available
for
the
furnishing
of
mail.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
the
postal
service
in
its
domestic
mail
manual
which
contains
the
regulations
for
these
and
a
number
of
other
functions
of
the
service,
provides
specifications
for
mailboxes,
the
size,
et
cetera,
and
also
contains
provisions
for
approval
of
certain
models
of
letter
boxes,
although
there
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
does.
it
applies
to
any
mailbox
which
is
either
put
up
by
the
postal
service
or
any
letter
box
that
is
furnished
by
the
individual
postal
customer
to
receive
the
mail.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
even
though
it's
not
locked.
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
reports
on
the
statute
when
it
was
enacted
in
1934...
that's
when
it
was
adopted...
specify
several
reasons.
one
was
the
protection
of
the
mail
revenue.
what
was
happening
in
the
1930s
is
that
a
number
of
business
concerns
were
delivering
their
own
bills
or
circulars,
that
type
of
thing,
which
they
were
authorized
to
do
under
the
private
express
statutes.
those
statutes
permit
a
person
to
carry
his
own
mail
to
a
home,
and
what
happened
is
these
companies
were
having
their
circulars
and
bills
delivered
to
premises
outside
of
the
mails,
but
they
were
using
the
letter
box
that
had
been
established
or
erected
on
mail
routes
for
the
receipt
of
the
u.s.
mail,
and
congress
determined
that
this
practice
of
delivering
things
outside
of
the
mail,
yet
using
the
mailbox,
was
depriving
the
postal
service
of
revenue.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
statute
does
not
extend
to
mail
slots.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
one
practical
difference
is
that
there
is
really
no
receptacle,
no
equivalent
of
a
mailbox
when
something
is
put
through
the
slot.
it
just
goes
into
the
home.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
the
receptacle
is
the
whole
home
and
i
think
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
exactly.
and
there
is
a
recognition,
i
think,
of
there
being
some
alternative
way
of
the
homeowner
getting
other
things
through
the
mail.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
a
mail
box
or
a
slot?
yes,
you
can--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
that
would
be
protruding.
otherwise,
it
can
be
placed
in
the
letter
box.
but
the
statute
does
only
apply
to
the
letter
boxes.
this
statute,
as
an--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
could
conceivably
but
this
statute
has
to
be
considered
against,
for
this
purpose,
the
private
express
statutes
which
have...
traditionally
the
postal
service
has
had
a
monopoly
in
the
areas
where
it
operates
since
the
1790s,
but
these
private
express
statutes
allow
other
persons,
as
i
mentioned,
to
deliver
their
own
mail,
and
the
carrier
can
deliver,
the
private
carrier
can
carry
the
mail
and
the
mail
slot
provides
a
reasonable
way
for
the
delivery
of
the
mail.
but
this
again--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
we
don't.
and
there's
another
factor
i
would
like
to
mention,
though,
and
that
is
that,
as
i
mentioned,
the
domestic
mail
manual
requires
the
customer
to
furnish
a
letter
box
as
a
condition
to
receiving
the
mail,
and
as
a
result
of
that
acceptance
of
the
letter
box
by
the
postal
service,
that
letter
box
in
effect
becomes
part
of
the
postal
delivery
system.
for
example,
as
a
result
of
that
acceptance
both
the
sender
and
recipient
of
mail
benefit
from
federal
criminal
statutes
which
bar
a
person
from
destroying
a
letter
box
that
is
on
the
outside
of
the
house
or
by
the
curb
and
also
from
tampering
with
the
mail
that
is
inside
such
a
letter
box.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
without--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
would
think
on...
perhaps
on
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
i'm
not
aware
that
the
statute
has
come
up,
or
has
been
applied
in
that
fashion.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
there
is...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
would...
well,
i
suppose
that's
correct.
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
that
the
description's
been--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
it's
mailed
it
would
not
be.
i
mean,
some
newspapers
are
mailed
by
second
class
postage,
which
is
available
for
a
publication.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
it
prohibits
only
the
deposit.
but
if
it
is
placed
in
the
letter
box
without
the
payment
of
the
established
postage,
then
that
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--you
mean,
by
private
carrier?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
there
are
alternatives.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
newspapers,
there
are
two
alternatives
that
come
to
mind.
one
is
a
number
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
a
number
of
newspapers
furnish
a
little
tube
they
can--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
against
the
law.
the
statute...
it
would
also
be
possible
in
the
case
of
a
newspaper,
for
example,
if
it
was
inclement
weather,
to
wrap
the
newspaper
in
a
plastic
bag
which
is
frequently
done.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
i
mentioned,
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1934,
but
the
postmaster
general
had
adopted
regulations
going
back
as
far
as
1907
to
prohibit
the
deposit
of
mailable
matter
in
postal
boxes
without
the
payment
of
postage.
one
of
the
purposes
that
i
mentioned
of
the
statute
has
been
to
raise
revenue
but
there
are
others.
another
purpose
noted
by
congress
in
1934
when
it
enacted
the
statute
was
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
clutter
in
mailboxes.
and
this
concern
is
elaborated
upon
in
a
statement
issued
by
the
postmaster
general
in
that
same
year
when
he
adopted
a
similar
prohibition
by
regulation
for
city
and
village
routes.
the
postmaster
general
stated
that
the
post
office
department...
this
statement,
incidentally,
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
postmaster
general
stated
that
the
post
office
department
had
been
deluged
with
complaints
by
citizens
that
their
private
mailboxes
were
being
filled
with
political
advertisements,
other
advertisements,
circulars,
bills,
and
the
postmaster
general
noted
that
this
clutter
particularly
in
urban
areas
had
caused
some
delay
for
the
letter
carriers,
and
because
of
difficulties
of
placing
the
mail--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i'm
talking
about
the
delay
in
the
letter
carrier's
making
his
rounds.
there
was
testimony
at
trial
in
this
case
that
if
a
letter
carrier
had
to
come
up
to
a
box
and
it's
filled
with
circulars
and
other
items
that
have
been
deposited
by
others,
the
letter
carrier
could
not
simply
deposit
the
incoming
mail
into
the
mailbox.
he
would
have
to
withdraw
the
other
materials,
sort
through
them,
and
see
if
perhaps
some
of
them
had
been
left
by
the
postal
customer
to
be
taken
away,
and
also
sort
through
them
to
see
whether
there
might
be
violations
of
the
private
express
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
volume
iii
of
the
record
in
this
court
contains
dozens
of
copies
of
letters
sent
out
by
the
postal
service
just
in
the
northeast
region
to
people
who
had
deposited
materials
in
postal
boxes
without
the
payment
of
postage
on
them,
and
what
the
postal
service
will
typically
do
rather
than
prosecuting
someone
is
to
demand
the
payment
of
postage
on
these
materials.
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
the
person
who
had
deposited
the
materials
will
comply
and
pay
the
postage.
so
that
the
record
does
establish
a
pattern
of
enforcement.
that's
not
to
say
that
there
are
not
some
occasions
in
which
the
statute
is
perhaps
violated,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
it
is
being
ignored
in
a
wholesale
fashion.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
have...
i'm
informed
that
there
has
just
been
one
attempted
prosecution,
and
as
i
understand
it
did
not
result
in
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
those
circulars
under
the
statute,
if
they're
to
be
deposited
in
the
letter
box,
are
to
have
the
proper
postage
attached
to
them.
also,
the
fact
that
there
are
no
criminal
prosecutions
does
not
reflect
a
lack
of
enforcement
effort
by
the
postal
service
under
this
statute.
i
should
make
that
clear.
so
the
postal
service
has
attempted
to
recover
the
postage
from
those
persons
who
deposit
the
mail
into
the
receptacle.
i
should
also
point
out--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it's
more
than
a
few
hundred.
as
i
recall,
there's
a
discussion
of
a
thousand
or
several
thousand
in
just
one
postal
inspection
area.
the
difficulty
with
statistics,
though,
is
that
the
responsibility
for
enforcing
the
prohibition
at
the
first
level
rests
with
the
postmaster
of
each
post
office,
and
it's
frequently
done
on
an
informal
basis,
even
a
telephone
call
to
the
person
who
deposited
the
material,
and
then
that
person
may
pay
in
several
dollars,
or
if
it's
just
several
pieces,
it
may
be
less
than
a
dollar.
so
that
to
my
knowledge
there
was
no
collection
of
this
information
from
all
post
offices
around
the
country.
what
evidence
there
was
in
the
record
concerned
situations
where
the
postmaster,
individual
postmaster
had
been
unable
to
collect
by
this
method
and
it
was
referred
to
the
postal
inspection
service
for
additional
efforts
to
collect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
when--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
i
think
would
not
be
because
the
statute,
i
believe,
specifically
refers
to
theft
of
the
mail.
i
don't
believe
these
other
materials
would
be
regarded
as
the
mail.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
would
not.
and
in
fact
the
alternative
of
furnishing
a
separate
receptacle
for
the
receipt
of
items
other
than
the
mail
was
one
of
the
alternatives
that
was
mentioned
during
the
debates
in
1932
on
a
predecessor
bill
to
the
one,
the
statute
eventually
enacted
in
1934
that
all
the
congress
has
done
is
limit
the
use
of
the
mailbox,
which
after
all
exists
because
of
the
postal
service.
congress
has
not
sought
in
this
statute
in
any
way
to
regulate
any
other
means
of
delivery
by
a
person
to
another
home
or
to
a
business.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe...
it
certainly
is
if
it's
mailed.
my
uncertainty
is
whether
materials
that
are
deposited
with
the
postage
into
the
letter
box
with
a
permanent
postage--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
right.
yes,
that
is
a
crime,
too.
it
is
a
crime.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
it
is
a
crime.
it
is
a
crime
to
steal
that.
now,
the
appellees
challenge
this
statute
under
the
first
amendment,
but...
and
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellees.
what
the
district
court
did
was
balance
what
it
perceived
to
be
the
postal
service's
need
to
enforce
this
statute
against
these
particular
civic
associations,
against
what
it
perceived
to
be
the
limitations
on
their
first
amendment
rights
if
the
appellees
were
forced
to
comply
with
the
statute.
in
our
view
this
ad
hoc
balancing
approach
fails
to
give
sufficient
deference
to
congress's
judgment
regarding
the
need
for
the
statute
in
the
generality
of
cases
and
it
would
also
make
vulnerable
many
statutes
or
regulations
of
general
applicability
adopted
by
the
postal
service
or
by
congress
to
regulate
a
mail
delivery
system
of
nationwide
scope.
the
district
court
apparently
believed
that
it
was
required
to
balance
the
need
for
the
statute
against
the
asserted
infringement--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
that
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
remanded
to
the
district
court
saying
it
should
not
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
from
the
district
court's
order
after
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--from
the
district
court's,
after
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
complaint.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
there
was
a
trial.
so
this
case,
this
appeal
is
directly
from
the
district
court.
now,
the
district
court
apparently
believed
that
some
balancing
was
appropriate
here
because
the
statute
infringed
on
appellees'
first
amendment
rights.
this
assertive
infringement
could
have
two
aspects.
one,
that
the
statute
somehow
inhibits
other
alternative
means
other
than
deposit
of
something
in
the
mailbox,
for
communicating.
or
it
could
be
a
contention
that
charging
postage
for
the
use
of
the
mailbox
itself
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
district
court
seems
to
have
believed
that
because
there
was
testimony
for
appellees
that
these
other
methods
of
delivery
were
unsatisfactory,
that
the
statute
somehow
inhibited
or
infringed
on
the
appellees'
right
to
deliver
materials.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
did
not,
but
it
did
hold
that
appellees
have
a
right
of
access
to
a
part
of
the
postal
system,
not
the
entire
part,
not
the
delivery
part,
but
to
the
letter
box,
which
is
the
terminus
or
the
end
of
the
delivery
process.
and
as
to
that,
the
district
court
clearly
held
that
these
appellees
have
a
right
of
access
to
that
without
paying
the
established
postage.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
will.
now--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
or,
one
of
the
justifications
appellees
advanced
below
for
using,
for
depositing
items
in
letter
boxes
free
of
charge
was
that
if
they
used
the
mail
the
process
would
be
too
slow
and
they
couldn't
inform
residents
of
the
need
to
attend
meetings
that
were
coming
up
very
quickly.
and
that
rationale--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
and
they
could
deliver
it
as
quickly
as
they
wanted.
so
that
certainly
is
no
reason
why
the
statute
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
believe
it
does
undercut
that
rationale,
because
one
of
the
concerns
is
that
it
will
increase
the
cost
to
the
postal
service
if
the
letter
carrier
has
to
go
to
the
box
and
sort
through
materials.
but
if
the
person
who
deposits
something
in
the
letter
box
pays
postage
on
it,
then
the
postal
service
is
being
reimbursed
to
the
extent
of
the
postage
for
the
additional
effort
of
the
letter
carrier
going
through
the
box.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
still
has
to
do
it
but
the
basis
of
that
argument
was
that
this
would
increase
the
cost
of
the
mail
delivery
system.
but
to
the
extent
someone
puts
postage
on
the
letter,
then
the
government
is
being
reimbursed
for
that
extra
effort.
i
did
want
to
make
one
point,
though,
regarding
the
asserted
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights.
and
that
is
that
the
other
alternatives
that
are
available
to
appellees,
such
as
placing
circulars
on
doorknobs,
or
behind
a
screen
door,
or
knocking
on
the
door
and
handing
a
circular
directly
to
the
customer
or
to
the
resident,
these
other
alternatives
exist
whether
or
not
the
resident
erects
a
mailbox.
and
therefore
the
erection
of
the
mailbox
and
the
postal
service's
approval
or
acceptance
of
that
mailbox
for
delivery
of
mail
has
absolutely
no
effect
on
all
the
other
alternatives
that
are
open
to
an
individual
for
the
delivery
of
messages.
so
the
erection
of
a
mailbox
cannot
be
said
in
any
respect
to
infringe
upon
the
appellees'
first
amendment
rights.
so
the
claim
would
have
to
be
reduced
to
the
assertion
that
appellees
have
a
right
of
access
to
the
mailbox
itself
irrespective
of
how
available
other
alternatives
may
be
to
them.
it's
a
claim
that
they
have
a
right
of
access
to
the
mailbox
itself,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
congress
cannot
establish
reasonable
postage
fees
for
the
use
of
facilities
related
to
the
mail.
the
postal
service
has
existed
as
long
as
the
first
amendment
in
this
country
and
has
charged
postage
for
the
use
of
the
mails,
and
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
in
our
view
to
suggest
that
significant
first
amendment
questions
are
raised
when
congress
establishes
a
rate
classification
system
for
the
use
of
postal
facilities
that
is
nondiscriminatory,
as
this
one
is,
and
is
reasonable.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
several
points.
one,
earlier
when
i
was
questioned
about
the
criminal
statutes
prohibiting
the
taking
of
materials
out
of
a
letter
box,
i
looked
back
at
18
united
states
code
1702
and
1708,
which
both
refer
to
the
taking
of
a
letter
from
an
authorized
receptacle
without
regard
to
whether
that
letter
was
sent
through
the
mail.
so,
according
to
the
terms
of
these
statutes,
it
would
appear
that
even
appellees'
materials
once
placed
in
a
letter
box
would
then,
if
they
had
placed
postage
on
them,
would
then
be
protected
by
these
federal
statutes,
and
so
they
would
in
effect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--these
criminal
statutes
do
not
contain...
they
just
refer
to...
well,
"letter"
is
among
several.
they
prefer
to
"parcel"
and
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
just
says,
"letter,
postal
card,
or
package.
"
without
qualification.
but
also,
with
respect
to
the
argument
based
on
the
private
express
statutes,
18
united
states
code
1694
and
1696,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
section
1725,
which
was
involved
here,
was
enacted
against
the
background
of
private
utility
companies
who
were
relying
on
the
private
express
statutes
to
carry
or
transmit
their
own
materials
outside
of
the
mail.
and
yet
congress
enacted
this
statute
to
prohibit
those
companies
from
using
a
facility
of
the
mail,
in
this
case,
the
letter
box,
to
effectuate
the
delivery
of
the
materials
they
had
carried.
so,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
there's,
i
think,
simply
no
room
for
the
argument
that
letters
that
are
delivered
to
a
home
under
the
private
express
statutes
are
somehow
exempt
from
the
prohibition
of
1725.
that
would
be
directly
contrary--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--mr.
justice
stewart,
that
was
footnote
4
on
page
31a
of
our
jurisdictional
statement,
and
there
the
district
court
did
reject
those
arguments.
now,
this
was
in
the
district
court's
first
opinion
before
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
one
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
our
argument
regarding
the
validity
of
the
statute
does
not
depend
on
factual
showings
in
the
district
court
regarding
the
adequacy
of
alternatives.
in
fact,
we
believe
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
the
complaint
the
first
time
around.
and
that
is
because
the
effectiveness
of
the
alternative
means
of
delivery
that
appellees
have
is
totally
unaffected
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
mailbox.
congress
is
not
obligated
by
the
first
amendment
to
provide
a
postal
service
or
mailboxes
and
in
the
absence,
if
congress
declined
to
do
so,
there
could
be
no
first
amendment
argument
that
congress
was
somehow
required
to
furnish
postal
boxes
for
the
delivery
of
mail.
and
since
the
mere
placement
of
a
postal
box
on
a
residence
does
not
change
the
effectiveness
of
the
available
alternatives.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
