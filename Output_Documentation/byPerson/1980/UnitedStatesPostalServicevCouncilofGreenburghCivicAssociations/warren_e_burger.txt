chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
postal
service
v.
council
of
greenburgh
civic
associations.
mr.
kneedler,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
i
believe
that
a
person
may
go
into
almost
any
hardware
store
and
buy
a
metal
box
which
has
imprinted
on
it
in
some
way,
usually
by
relief,
u.s.
mail>
["].
now,
are
those...
i
seem
to
recall,
they
have
some
indication
that
they
are
approved
by
the
postal
service?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
there
another
factor?
it
happens
that
my
mailbox
is
some
distance
from
my
house.
our
outgoing
mail
is
placed
in
the
box
in
the
morning
before
the
mailman
arrives
on
the
assumption,
correctly,
i
think,
that
the
mailman
will
take
that
mail
and
put
it
in
the
stream
of
outgoing
mail.
you
can't
do
that
with
a
mail
slot.
chief
justice
burger
you
can't
do
it
if
it's
inside
the
slot.
you'd
have
to
have
it
protruding.
chief
justice
burger
you
might
have
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
from
some
court
before
you
knew
whether
it
was
pornographic
material
or
not.
mr.
kneedler,
in
our
place
of
residence
in
fairfax
county
we
have
a
curbside
mailbox
and
the
morning
newspaper
is,
every
day,
stuck
in
the
mailbox.
i
take
it
that's
a
technical
violation
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
suppose
we
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact,
since
we
see
it
as
we
drive
down
the
roads,
that
the
newspapers
furnish
a
circular
mail
chute
with
the
name
of
the
newspaper
on
it.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
a
federal
crime
to
steal
a
piece
of
mail
after
it's
once
inside
that
box?
chief
justice
burger
whether
it's
outgoing
or
incoming
mail?
chief
justice
burger
what
about
theft
of
some
of
the
junk
that's
put
in
there?
is
that
a
federal
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
you
have
a
first
amendment
right
to...
does
anyone
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
walk
into
a
private
property
and
open
the
door
and
put
something
behind
the
screen
door?
chief
justice
burger
must
the
homeowner
put
a
no
trespassing
sign
up
in
order
to
preserve
his
right
to
privacy?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
hammer,
if
the
federal
express
or
united
parcel
service
delivering
some
piece
of
material...
i
suppose
we
can't
use
the
word
"mail"...
put
it
in
one
of
these
boxes,
they'd
be
violating
the
statute,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
burger
well,
aren't
they
direct
competitors?
haven't
they
taken
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
business
away
from
the
post
office?
chief
justice
burger
probably?
well,
if
you
rely
on
the
wall
street
journal
on
the
revenues
of
federal
express
and
united
parcel
service,
there
can't
be
any
question
about
it,
can
there?
chief
justice
burger
but
your
posture
would
be
the
same,
i
should
think,
on
the
first
amendment,
if
you
wanted
to
be
sure
to
get
delivery
and
couldn't
depend
on
the
mail,
the
postal
service,
that
you
engaged
united
parcel
service
or
federal
express
to
make
your
deliveries
for
you.
chief
justice
burger
and
that's
taking
business
away
from
the
postal
service
and
using
one
of
their
facilities,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
take
you
back
a
moment.
you
made
a
statement,
something
to
the
effect
that
if
you
can't
put
it
in
the
mailbox
you
are
denied
access
to
delivery.
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
burger
why
can't
you
put
it
behind
the
screen
door,
put
it
on
the
porch,
put
it
in
a
dozen
other
places?
chief
justice
burger
if
the
twelve
apostles
said
black
was
white,
no
court
has
to
believe
it.
these
experts
don't
know
any
more
about
it
than
anyone
else
in
the
world.
chief
justice
burger
there
are
hot
unlimited,
but
a
dozen
other
places
to
make
this
delivery.
chief
justice
burger
you
submit
they're
clearly
erroneous,
isn't
that
it?
chief
justice
burger
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
if
a
statute
isn't
enforced
some
kind
of
a
special
doctrine
of
laches
runs
against
the
government.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
