justice
rehnquist
and
that's
true
even
though
the
box
is
privately
owned?
justice
rehnquist
if
it's
simply
brought
by
a
carrier
and
stuck
in
the
box?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
homeowner
put
up
a
regulation
mailbox
and
then
in
the
center
of
his
yard
put
up
a
bushel
basket
and
said,
non
mailable
matter,
and
all
the
political
circulars
and
civic
meeting
notices
and
so
forth
were
supposed
to
go
in
there?
would
it
be
any
violation
of
any
federal
statute
to
take
something
out
of
that
bushel
basket?
justice
rehnquist
--do
you
think
the
district
court
held
that
the
appellees
had
a
right
to
have
the
post
office
department
carry
their
circulars
free
of
postage?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
post
office
will
carry
any
of
appellees'
circulars
if
they
just
pay
some
postage
on
it?
justice
rehnquist
under
village
of
schaumberg,
i
would
think,
even
under
circulars,
he
would
have
to,
wouldn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
can
talk
about
the
normal
procedure
for
the
sawmill
valley
civic
association,
presumably,
but
do
you
think
you
can
speak
uniformly
of
the
civic
associations
for
50
states?
justice
rehnquist
all
over
the
country.
justice
rehnquist
the
borough
or
township
of
sawmill
valley
is
not
below
the
poverty
line?
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
someone
who
is
not
paid
for
violating
a
statute
doesn't
violate
it?
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
"of
necessity".
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
would
you
say
that
a
person
could
take
an
unstamped
letter
to
the
post
office
and
say,
i
have
had
kind
of
a
bad
year
this
year,
i
can't
afford
a
stamp,
but
the
first
amendment
requires
you
to
deliver
it
for
me?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
commercial?
after
virginia
board
of
pharmacy,
aren't
they
entitled
to
first
amendment
rights?
justice
rehnquist
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
who
can
afford
it
and
who
can't.
justice
rehnquist
this
was
a
civil
action,
was
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
brought
by
your
clients?
justice
rehnquist
you
didn't
raise
the
statutory
argument
in
your
lower
court
argument?
justice
rehnquist
but
not
the
statutory
argument
you've
raised
here?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
try
a
statute
the
way
you
litigate
ordinary
individuals?
isn't
there
a
presumption
of
validity
in
favor
of
every
federal
statute
that
congress
chooses
to
enact?
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that?
justice
rehnquist
i
mean
a
case
authority
from
this
court.
that
the
ordinary
presumption
is
inapplicable.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
was
asking
for
a
case.
