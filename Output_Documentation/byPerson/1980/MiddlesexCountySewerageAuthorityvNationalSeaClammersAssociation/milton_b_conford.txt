mr.
milton
b.
conford
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
action
present
important
questions
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
adoption
of
recent
comprehensive
water
pollution
legislation.
one
of
these
statutes,
commonly
known
as
the
clean
water
act,
adopted
in
1972
is
an
extensive
revision
of
previous
federal
water
pollution
legislation.
the
second
statute
involved,
commonly
known
as
the
ocean
dumping
act,
adopted
in
1972,
and
also
amended
in
1977.
this
is
an
action
brought
by
an
association
of
fishermen
claiming
to
have
been
injured
by
pollution
of
the
ocean
by
some
six
or
seven
new
jersey
sewerage
agencies
and
several
new
york
agencies,
all
public
agencies.
the
action
of
the
plaintiff
is
couched
in
several
counts,
the
major
one,
based
upon
violation
of
these
statutes.
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
defendants
based
upon
jurisdictional
and
substantive
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
reversed,
and
remanded
for
trial.
three
issues
evolved
from
the
differences
of
opinion
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
which
this
court
has
certified
for
consideration
today.
these
are,
first,
whether
there
was
an
implied
private
remedy
flowing
from
these
statutes.
secondly,
whether
private
parties'
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
invoke
the
federal
common
law
nuisance
remedy
declared
by
this
court
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee.
and
third,
whether
if
there
is
such
status
for
a
private
action
it
has
been
preempted
by
the
clean
water
act
and
the
ocean
dumping
act
in
relation
to
the
complaint
in
this
case.
in
view
of
the
time
constraints
that
i
am
under
in
this
matter,
i
propose
with
the
court's
leave
to
address
the
second
and
third
issues,
on
which
i
am
opposed
both
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
respondents.
the
solicitor
general
supports
us
only
on
the
first
issue,
that
concerning
whether
there
was
an
implied
cause
of
action.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
he
agrees
with
us
that
there
is
not.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
the
case?
no.
if
there
is
no
implied
cause
of
action
there
may
be
a
federal
common
law
nuisance
action.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
that
is
right.
i
turn
to
the
second
issue,
which
will
be
found
to
share
a
common
rationale
with
the
third
issue
as
i
develop
it.
that
is,
whether
this
court
should
today
declare
that
there
is
an
across
the
board
remedy
available
to
anybody
based
on
common
law
nuisance.
an
inquiry
into
that
question
cannot
be
approached
without
a
consideration
of
the
context
of
the
comprehensive
statutes
as
they
now
exist.
in
short
the
issue
is,
should
this
court
now
declare
that
there
is
a
broad
based,
across
the
board,
available
to
anybody,
federal
cause
of
action
for
nuisance
in
the
context
of
the
simultaneous
existence
of
these
comprehensive
regulatory
water
pollution
statutes?
i
submit
that
consideration
of
the
traditional,
well
known
bases
for
the
court
enunciating
federal
common
law
should
dictate
that
such
a
cause
of
action
should
not
exist.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
should
supplement
what
i
said
before
the
recess
by
indicating
that
all
of
the
sewerage
agencies
in
this
case
possessed
united
states
epa
permits,
both
for
the
sewage
effluent
and
the
sewage
sludge
dumping
which
are
complained
of
in
this
action.
now,
as
i
said
before
the
recess,
our
conception
of
the
applicability
of
federal
common
law
should
in
the
context
of
the
presently
existing
situation,
not
that
which
existed
when
this
court
last
decided
this
question
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee.
what
we
are
now
confronted
with
is
the
question
of
whether
federal
common
law
should
exist
on
an
across
the
board
basis
in
the
context
of
the
comprehensive
regulatory
mechanism
which
is
constituted
both
by
the
clean
water
act
and
the
ocean
dumping
act.
our
study
of
the
occasions
for
declaring
federal
common
law
as
declared
by
this
court
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
appropriate
occasion
now
to
declare
federal
common
law
of
the
extent
demanded
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
one
illustration
of
traditional
application
of
federal
common
law
is
where
a
state
is
a
party
to
an
action,
either
a
state
against
another
state
or
a
state
against
citizens
of
another
state.
in
that
situation,
based
upon
the
constitution,
there
are
being
no
statute
applicable
this
court
by
necessity
has
had
to
declare
federal
common
law.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
what
i'm
trying
to
do,
justice
brennan,
is
to
indicate
that
of
the
generally
accepted
criteria
for
applying
federal
common
law,
none
is
appropriate
to
the
present
situation.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
where
there's
a
statute?
mr.
milton
b.
conford
where
there's
a
federal
statute?
mr.
milton
b.
conford
except
to
the
extent
that
it
is
thought
necessary
to
supply
statutory
interstices.
we
maintain
that
in
this
case
not
only
is
there
not
the
situation
of
a
state
party,
but
there
is
no
occasion
for
applying
interstices.
what
we
have
here
is
clearly
not
a
situation
of
interstitial
law.
we
have
an
alternate
rival
system
attempted
to
be
set
forth:
to
wit,
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance,
under
which
a
judge,
as
justice
douglas
said
in
the
milwaukee
case,
operates
according
to
no
fixed
rules
but
he
is
the
chancellor,
exercising
his
informed
judgement
as
to
what
should
be.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
no,
it
was
said
in
the
context
of
a
state
party
suit.
and
that's
why
i
say
it
is
not
applicable
here.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
exactly.
and
the
court,
in
an
effort
to
serve
its
policy
of
not
taking
original
jurisdiction,
labored
to
find
an
alternate
basis
for
jurisdiction
because
of
its
felt
need
that
a
state
affected
by
pollution
coming
from
another
state
ought
to
be
afforded
a
remedy.
now,
another
common
basis
for
applying
federal
common
law
or
creating
federal
common
law
is
when
implicated
a
distinct
federal
policy,
sometimes
statutory
and
sometimes
not,
but
the
necessity
of
supplying
uniformity
so
that
the
same
rule
applies
in
all
circumstances,
whether
federal
or
state.
we
submit
that
that
criterion
for
the
creation
of
federal
common
law
equally
does
not
exist
here.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
yes.
that
was
the
determination
that
there
should
be
an
action
to
enforce
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
applied
uniformly,
whether--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--nationally,
whether
the
problem
arose
either
in
state
or
federal
system.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
now,
clearly,
that
does
not
apply
here,
the
objective
of
uniformity.
when
you
have
two
systems,
one,
federal
nuisance
law
and
the
other,
a
regulated
statutory
system,
it's
the
opposite
of
uniformity.
depending
upon
the
plaintiff's
choice
to
go
tort
law
or
go
statutory
law,
you
can
have
two
entirely
different
results.
and
even
in
the
tort
situation
itself,
there
is
a
built
in
factor
against
uniformity,
because
two
federal
district
court
judges
hearing
approximately
the
same
kind
of
a
nuisance
case
could
arrive
at
different
subjective
judgments
as
to
whether
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
was
reasonable.
so
we
submit,
there
again,
there
is
no
uniformity
purpose
in
setting
up
these
remedies
side
by
side.
i
can't
think
of
any
other
appropriate
federal
law
basis
that
would
be
applicable
to
these
situations.
i
think
having
negated
those
which
are
generally
understood
and
generally
applicable,
it
must
follow
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
create
the
federal
common
law
remedy
which
our
adversaries
advocate.
now,
that
leads
me
to
the
issue
of
preemption.
we
have
an
unusual
type
of
preemption
here.
it
is
not
federal
statute
against
state
statute.
it
is
federal
statute
against
federal
common
law.
for
this
purpose
i
assume
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
there
would
be
a
federal
across
the
board
common
law
remedy.
the
applicable
rule
in
this
situation
is
illustrated
by
arizona
v.
california,
in
which
this
court
held
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
court
had
created
a
common
law
of
equitable
apportionment
of
waters
in
an
interstate
stream,
nevertheless,
when
the
congress
adopted
specific
legislation
reallocating
the
distribution
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river,
that
settled
the
question
and
it
supplanted
federal
common
law
of
equitable
apportionment
of
water.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
whatever
it
is--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--but
it's
a
type
of
preemption,
and
this
court
has
certified--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--well,
i
think
this
court
certified
the
question
in
those
terms,
because
justice
douglas
suggested
in
the
milwaukee
case
that
a
time
might
come
when
comprehensive
federal
water
pollution
legislation
might
preempt
the
common
law.
i
agree
with
you
that
conceptually
it
is
not
preemption,
it's
displacement,
because
congress
has
the
last
word.
if
congress
decides
that
the
law
should
be
thus
and
so
and
it
is
contrary
to
pre
existing
federal
common
law,
that's
it,
and--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--exactly.
and
we
maintain
that
that
is
the
situation
here.
now,
central
to
this
inquiry
is
a
question
of,
does
the
reorganization
of
the
federal
water
pollution
act,
is
it
of
a
scope
which
should
cause
a
different
approach
than
that
which
existed
when
the
rudimentary
water
pollution
statute
existed
prior
to
1972?
this
court
has
been
instructed
on
that
question
by
the
very
able
opinion
of
judge
tone
in
the
7th
circuit,
in
the
illinois-milwaukee
case
which
you
heard
in
december,
which
contains
a
very
comprehensive
discussion
of
the
differences
between
the
rudimentary
water
pollution
statute
as
it
existed
prior
to
1972
and
as
it
exists
now.
but
i
think
the
best
and
most
pithy
summary
of
what
congress
intended
to
do
and
what
thought
of
the
old
statute
is
a
quotation
from
the
public
works
committee
report
on
the
1972
amendments.
and
here's
what
they
said:
"water
pollution
control
in
the
past
has
been
all
too
often
sporadic,
inconsistent,
and
improvised
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
"
they
said,
"our
major
purpose
in
adopting
this
legislation
is
to
establish
a
comprehensive,
longrange
policy
for
the
elimination
of
water
pollution,
making
it
clear,
to
industry
and
municipalities
alike
what
the
water
pollution
performance
will
be
expected
of
them
during
the
coming
decade.
"
that
states
it
better
than
i
possibly
could.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
yes,
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that
now.
i
was
going
to
do
it
later.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
i
say
it
does
not.
in
the
first
place,
the
reference
is
to
statutes
and
common
law.
in
my
judgment
the
legislature
did
not
actually
mean
federal
common
law
when
it
said
common
law.
when
congress
talks
about
common
law,
ordinarily
i
think
they
mean
state
common
law,
general
common
law.
secondly--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--you
mean,
whether
it
does?
mr.
milton
b.
conford
it
does
not?
that's
my
opinion.
secondly,
the
argument
that
it
means
federal
law
is
hardly
realistic
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
concept
concerning
federal
common
law
in
the
water
pollution
area
was
only
developed
by
this
court
in
1972.
this
legislation
was
going
through
the
legislature
and
had
adopted
this
language
before
the
court
spoke
in
1972
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee.
and,
thirdly,
if
it
were
to
be
accepted
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
did
mean
federal
common
law,
that
then
puts
the
ball
back
in
this
court's
jurisdiction,
because
it
is
for
this
court
to
say
what
is
appropriate
federal
common
law
in
that
context.
and
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
already
developed
indicating
why
federal
common
law
in
this
area
would
be
inappropriate,
that
takes
care
of
the
savings
clause,
i
believe,
completely.
now,
what
they
did
mean
by
the
savings
clause,
in
my
judgment,
was
state
statutes
and
state
common
law.
for
example,
the
water
pollution
act
specifically
invites
states
to
participate
by
adopting
more
stringent
regulations,
by
setting
up
area
wide
water
quality
standards,
and
new
jersey,
in
fact,
has
adopted
legislation
along
both
of
these
lines.
new
jersey
adopted
in
1977
both
a
water
pollution
control
act
consistent
with
the
federal
act,
and
an
area--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--exactly.
but
you
could
have
state
common
law.
for
example,
there
could
be
a
state
nuisance
action,
there
could
be
a
state
trespass
action--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--the
new
jersey
courts
could
adopt
the
standards
contained
in
the
statute
and
in
the
regulations
as
appropriate
standards
for
conduct
in
common
law
actions.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
they
would
have
to
be
more
stringent
as
far
as
pollution
permits
are
concerned,
but
they
could,
in
this
case,
fill
in
interstices
in
the
federal
regulations.
if
there
were
a
specific
situation
based
upon
water
quality
of
a
particular
body
of
water
that
epa
had
not
regulated,
the
state
of
new
jersey
could
do
so.
and
those
standards
would
apply
in
a
new
jersey
state
court
common
law
action.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
if
it
were
inconsistent--
mr.
milton
b.
conford
--it
is
permitted
to
be
more
strict.
the
statute
expressly
permits
it
to
be
more
strict.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
state
common
law
would
come
along
if
there
were
an
action
for
trespass,
an
action
for
negligence,
an
action
for
nuisance
based
on
water
pollution.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
i
think
so.
the
state
statute
could
not
supersede,
could
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
statute
or
federal
regulations
except
to
the
extent
that
a
permit
could
be
more
stringent.
the
state
could
require
a
more
stringent
regulation,
because
the
clean
water
act
expressly
permits
that.
now,
our
adversaries
would
argue
that
there
should
not
be
preemption
in
the
loose
sense
that
i've
been
using
the
for
the
reason
that
all
that
the
clean
water
act
and
the
ocean
dumping
act
purport
to
do
is
to
set
standards
but
not
to
affirmatively,
but
not
to
constitute
an
affirmative
policy
which
would
be
impervious
to
a
common
law
action.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
only
as
to
their
territorial
waters.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
inside;
not
the
ocean.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
i
believe
so,
three
miles
from
the
shoreline.
evidence
of
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
give
agencies
involved
in
this
situation,
whether
industrial
or
public,
time
and
reasonable
standards,
not
perfection,
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
clean
water
act
contains
a
very
numerous
set
of
time
regulations.
certain
things
have
to
be
done
180
days
after
the
statute
is
adopted,
certain
things
have
to
be
done
300
days
later.
by
1977
the
public
sewerage
agencies
must
achieve
secondary
treatment.
by
1983
they
must
achieve
what
is
described
as
the
best
practicable
waste
treatment
technology
over
the
life
of
the
works.
in
the
case
of
certain
industrial
pollutants
that
are
particularly
harmful...
i'm
now
paraphrasing...
congress
has
said
that
there
should
be
obtained
the
best
available
technology
achievable
to
result
in
reasonable
progress
to
elimination
of
pollution.
i
therefore
suggest
that
there
is
an
affirmative
congressional
not
only
to
permit
these
agencies
to
meet
these
standard,
but
to
be
given
time.
congress
realized
that
a
pollution
situation
which
has
developed
for
decades
couldn't
be
solved
overnight,
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
time
stages
in
which
these
agencies
could
achieve
the
goal
of
approaching
a
pollution
free
situation.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
milton
b.
conford
nothing
further,
sir;
thank
you.
