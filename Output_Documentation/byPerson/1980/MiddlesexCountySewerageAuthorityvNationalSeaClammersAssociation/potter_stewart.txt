justice
stewart
he
agrees
with
you
that
there
is
not?
justice
stewart
would
that
be
illustrated
by
the
lincoln
mills
kind
of
case?
justice
stewart
and
that
it
should
be--
justice
stewart
--uniformly;
nationally
applicable.
justice
stewart
is
it
your
position
that
the
savings
clause
did
no
more
than
preserve
previously
existing
rights
of
action,
whatever
they
may
have
been,
if
any?
justice
stewart
or
that
it
had,
it
preserved
some
sort
of
private
rights
of
actions,
depending
upon
this
very
statute?
justice
stewart
the
savings
clause
didn't,
certainly?
justice
stewart
preserve
preexisting
causes,
if
any?
justice
stewart
well,
then,
wasn't...
isn't
mr.
justice
stevens
correct
in
suggesting
that
until
this
statute
came
along
there
was
no
such
right
of
action?
even
conceivably.
justice
stewart
it
does.
justice
stewart
there
weren't;
there
were
not.
the
concept
didn't
exist,
did
it?
justice
stewart
was
there
a
common
law
nuisance
right
of
action
in
a
federal
court
with
no
diversity--
justice
stewart
--yes,
i
know,
but
the
state
was
a
plaintiff
there.
i'm
talking
about--
justice
stewart
--a
private
nuisance
action.
was
there
any
such
thing?
do
you
know
of
any?
can
you
cite
us
any?
justice
stewart
which
was
the
state,
the
state
was
the
plaintiff
there.
justice
stewart
although
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
about
what
remedies
existed,
if
any.
justice
stewart
and
will
you
tell
me
again
what
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
is?
justice
stewart
so
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
of
a
common
law
nuisance
cause
of
action
because
of
1331?
justice
stewart
and
this
is
only
because
this
is
an
interstate
nuisance?
justice
stewart
but
that
wouldn't
be
1331
jurisdiction?
justice
stewart
that
would
be
the
other
jurisdictional
statutes--
justice
stewart
--and
a
federal
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction,
would
it?
justice
stewart
well,
at
the
time
that
was
formulated
in
congress,
had
there
been
any
cases
affirming
the
existence
of
a
private
action
for
damages
for
nuisance
in
a
federal
court
invoking
independent
federal
jurisdiction
of
it?
justice
stewart
except
for
the
misnomer,
"savings
clause",
and
you
say
it's
a
misnomer?
justice
stewart
until
this
case,
have
there
been
independent
actions
by
private
parties
for
damages
for
nuisances
invoking
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
stewart
did
that
invoke
federal
jurisdiction
under
1331?
justice
stewart
it
wasn't
a
diversity
case?
justice
stewart
so,
it
was
thought,
there
held
to
involve
a
federal
question?
