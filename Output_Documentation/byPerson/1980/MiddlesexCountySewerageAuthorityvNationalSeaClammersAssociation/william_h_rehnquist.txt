justice
rehnquist
it's
just
like
a
superseding
statute.
justice
rehnquist
otherwise
you'd
overrule
erie
v.
tompkins,
wouldn't
you?
justice
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that,
when
the
federal
statute
provides
for
effluent
limitations
and
specific
permits
and
so
forth,
and
a
federal
nuisance
remedy
could
simply
involve
a
single
federal
judge
saying,
well,
i
don't
think
the
epa
or
whoever
it
is
that
administers
the
effluent
permits
acted
with
sufficient
stringency
here.
i'm
going
to
reduce
the
effluent
limit.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
federal
judge
could
go
beyond
the
permit
and
say,
well,
this
permit
allows
too
much
effluent
and
under
the
common
law
of
nuisance
i'm
going
to
say
it's
only
half
as
much?
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
a
statutory
review
provision
for
epa
that
a
person
dissatisfied
by
the
permit
issued
can
appeal
<epa's>
[=
epa's]
actions?
justice
rehnquist
but
can't
that
be
read
as
simply
preempting,
federal
law
preempting
state
law
and
not
necessarily
precluding
federal
law
preempting
preexisting
federal
common
law?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
in
the
illinois
v.
city
of
milwaukee,
the
court
was
quite
specific
about
stating
that
perhaps
eventually
federal
common
law
would
be
superseded
by
a
federal
statute
too.
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
didn't
congress
simply
endorse
the
common
law
of
nuisance
rather
than
provide
for
a
whole
series
of
effluent
limitations
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
the
epa
issues
specific
permits,
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
to
permit
dumping,
and
allow
review
of
each
of
those
actions
in
federal
courts?
justice
rehnquist
a
savings
clause
ordinarily
is
just
that,
a
time
lock,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
your
byram
river
case,
supposing
there
had
been
an
effluent
permit
granted,
and
the
district
court
said,
we
think
epa
was
just
all
off
base
here,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
cut
the
amount
of
effluent
in
half.
now,
do
you
think
that
congress
welcomed
that
sort
of
conflict
when
it
adopted
the
water
pollution
control
act?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
person
who
has
the
effluent
permit
supposed
to
do
when
the
district
judge
tells
him,
no,
you
can
only
do
half
of
what
the
epa
has
told
you
you
can
do?
