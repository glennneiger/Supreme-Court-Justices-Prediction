justice

well,
is
this
an
argument,
judge
conford?
in
light
of
the
statutes,
there's
just
no
room
for
that.
justice
jr.
without
regard
to
others?
in
any
event,
where
there's
a
statute
that
regulates
the
subject
matter.
justice
jr.
a
federal
statute.
justice
jr.
that
displaces
any
room
for
federal
common
law.
justice
jr.
the
word,
then,
is
either
supplanted,
displaced,
whatever
it
is--
justice
jr.
--but
it's
not
preemption,
because
preemption
is
reserved
usually,
as
you
said,
to
state
and
federal
controversies.
justice
jr.
well,
maybe
it
would
be
easier
to
understand
if
we
didn't
use
the
word,
preemption.
justice
jr.
i
gather
the
test,
whether
the
state
rule,
whether
it's
statutory
or
judicial
may
operate,
depends
on
whether
it's
more
stringent
than
the
federal
regulations.
justice
jr.
if
it
held
up
to
a
higher
standard
than
the
federal
statute?
justice
jr.
or
still
more
stringent?
justice
jr.
that's
three
mile
limit,
isn't
it,
along
the
coast?
