chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
middlesex
county
sewerage
authority
v.
the
national
sea
clammers.
mr.
conford,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
i
see.
yes.
but
he
disagrees
with
you
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
on
that
point.
0
[recess.]
mr.
conford,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
burger
well,
then
that
was
said
in
the
context...
or
put
it
another
way,
was
that
said
in
the
context
of
a
private
party
suit?
chief
justice
burger
which
began
as
an
original
jurisdiction,
case.
chief
justice
burger
well,
isn't
that
true
throughout
the
law?
common
on
law
without
any
adjectives
means...
does
not
embrace
federal
common
law.
chief
justice
burger
does
not.
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting,
from
what
you
say,
is
it
possible
that
each
of
the
coastal
states
could
have
a
standard
more
stringent
than
the
federal
with
respect
to
offshore?
chief
justice
burger
inside?
not
the
offshore?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
now
into
your
colleague's
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
horowitz?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you're
referring
to
a
nuisance
suit,
common
law
nuisance
claim
that's
preserved?
what
is
preserved?
would
you
give
us
some
concrete
illustrations?
chief
justice
burger
that's
where
you
and
mr.
conford
part
company,
at
that
point?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
what
was
there
to
save?
what
federal
rule--
chief
justice
burger
--whatever
existed.
well,
isn't
there
some
truth
to
what
judge
conford
said
that
the
court
more
or
less
cast
about
for
a
reason
to
give
the
state
of
illinois
another
forum
in
which
to
try
its
case
than
this
one,
by
saying
that
federal
common
law
was
available?
chief
justice
burger
just
one
question,
if
i
may,
before
you
sit
down.
on
this
matter
of
uniformity
that
you
seem
to
press,
taking
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
illustration:
one
district
judge
has
imposed
a
more
stringent
standard;
the
one
in
the
next
district
might
go
the
other
way.
is
that
not
so?
another
district
judge
in
the
same
circuit?
and
until
the
circuit
settled
it,
you'd
have
no
uniformity.
chief
justice
burger
you
wouldn't
have
any
uniformity
until
finally
all
of
these
cases
would
work
their
way
through
the
circuits
by
conflicts
up
to
this
court.
you
may
have
two,
three,
five
years
before
you'd
have
any
uniformity
in
this
field.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
corbin.
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
an
assumption,
that
congress
was
buying
a
pig
in
a
poke?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
judge
conford,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
