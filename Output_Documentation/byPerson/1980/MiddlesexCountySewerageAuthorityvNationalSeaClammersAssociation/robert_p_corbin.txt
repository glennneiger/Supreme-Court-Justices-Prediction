mr.
robert
p.
corbin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
brief
review
of
the
factual
background
of
this
case
that
is
submitted
is
helpful
to
a
full
consideration
of
the
significant
environmental
issues
present.
my
clients
are
the
national
sea
clammers
association
and
mr.
gosta
lovgren,
individuals
who
are
commercial
fishermen
and
ply
their
trade
in
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
ocean
immediately
adjacent
to
the
state
of
new
jersey.
during
the
summer
of
1976
there
occurred
what
may
be
described
as
a
rapid
and
massive
growth
of
algae
in
the
geographic
area
ranging
from
the
southwest
portion
of
long
island
to
a
point
approximately
due
east
of
the
southern
tip
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
specifically,
what
we
complain
about
is
that
when
this
massive
algal
bloom
died,
it
settled
on
the
ocean
floor
creating
a
condition
of
oxygen
deficiency
or
anoxia
in
and
about
the
waters
on
the
ocean
floor.
as
a
result,
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
death
and
destruction
to
the
marine
and
other
life
of
the
ocean,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
the
ocean
bottom
dwellers
who
were
not
equipped
to
escape
the
blighted
area.
the
impact
of
this
algal
bloom
was
especially
deleterious
since
july
is
the
normal
spawning
season,
so
it
had
an
impact
not
only
on
the
existing
stocks
of
fish
and
shellfish
but
future
stocks
of
marine
life
in
and
about
the
blighted
area.
as
a
result
of
this
the
commercial
fishing/clamming
related
industries
were
virtually
destroyed.
in
their
complaint
we
have
alleged
that
this
algal
bloom
resulted
from
two
differing
types
of
conduct.
it
was
first
alleged
that
the
city
of
new
york
and
various
other
new
york
and
new
jersey
municipalities
discharge
sewage
sludge
and
other
waste
materials,
many
of
which
are
highly
toxic,
into
the
hudson
river
and
new
york
harbor
where
it
is
then
carried
out
into
the
atlantic
ocean.
the
second
and
somewhat
different
aspect
of
the
causal
part
of
this
problem
arises
from
the
fact
that
various
municipalities
ostensibly
under
the
aegis
of
the
army
corps
of
engineers
directly
dump
similar
materials,
including
very
highly
toxic
substances,
directly
into
the
atlantic
ocean
where
it
was
actually
transported
out
by
boat
and
by
barge.
of
the
three
issues
that
this
court
designated
to
entertain
argument
on,
we
first
present
argument
with
respect
to
our
position
that
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
has
not
been
preempted
since
this
court's
first
recognition
of
that
remedy
in
the
leading
decision
of
illinois
v.
city
of
milwaukee.
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
there
are
at
least
three
arguments
which
we
maintain
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
not
only
continues
but
is
available
for
my
clients
in
this
case.
first,
an
analysis
of
the
two
statutes,
of
the
two
environmental
statutes
with
which
we
are
involved.
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
and
its
amendments,
and
the
marine
protection
research
and
sanctuaries
act
indicate
that
where
congress
has
chosen
to
preempt
an
area
either
entirely
or
partially,
it
has
done
so
expressly.
to
cite
but
two
examples.
first,
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act,
as
i
believe
judge
conford
has
already
noted,
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
has
preempted
the
authority
of
a
state,
of
any
municipality
within
the
state,
or
of
any
similar
agency
from
adopting
or
enforcing...
yes,
sir?
from
adopting
or
enforcing
any
effluent
standard
or
limitation
less
stringent
than
that
adopted
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
federal
statutes.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
would
have
been
much
more
explicit.
i
would
further
suggest
that
that
provision
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
must
also
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
savings
clause
of
that
statute,
which
i
believe
is
even
clearer
statutory
language
to
this
court
that
they
did
not
intend
to
preempt
the
rights
and
remedies
that
already
existed
at
the
time
that
the
savings
clause
was
enacted.
i
would
also
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
savings
clause
which
indicates,
other
than
perhaps
the
misnomer
which
has
been
attached
to
it,
to
suggest
that
that
only
reserved
rights
and
remedies
which
existed
as
of
the
time
it
was
enacted,
as
opposed
to
the
rights
and
remedies
which
would
grow
out
of
a
developing
state
or
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
or
in
other
environmental
areas--
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
--i
would
certainly
concede,
your
honor,
that
that
argument
was
made,
but
with
respect,
we
would
submit
that
if
that
time
is
ever
going
to
come,
it
certainly
hasn't
come
now.
i
think
at
the
time
the
federal
environmental
statutes
were
enacted,
at
least
a
part
of
the
congressional
purpose
and
design
was
the
recognition
that
the
previously
existing
statutes
were
inadequate
in
a
number
of
respects,
not
the
least
of
which
was
the
fact
that
whereas
the
previous
emphasis
for
environmental
protection
was
thrust
upon
the
states,
it
was
determined
that
for
whatever
reason
the
states
were
simply
not
carrying
out
those
dictates.
i
think
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
provisions
of
the
two
statutes,
the
clean
water
act
and
amendments,
and
the
ocean
dumping
act,
indicates
that
the
approach
currently
taken
by
congress
is
to
afford
a
full
panoply
of
federal
protection,
but
that
that
protection
to
be
provided
is
not
antagonistic
but
rather
will
be
coextensive
with
the
availability
of
private
enforcement,
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
suit
where
you
have
individuals
who
are
not
just
claiming
that
the
water
that
was
polluted
smelled
bad,
that
they
couldn't
fish
or
boat
or
enjoy
other
recreational
activities
normally
attendant
with
the
atlantic
ocean.
these
men's
businesses
were
destroyed.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
i
would
submit,
respectfully,
your
honor,
that
indeed
congress
did
endorse
precisely
that,
namely,
the
continued
availability
of
the
private
damage
remedy
where
damages
can
be
shown.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
from
the
1972
senate
report
which
considered
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
and
clearly
and
unambiguously
indicated
that
the
private
damage
remedy
remains
where
damages
could
be
shown,
as
indeed
we
maintain
our
clients
can
show.
and
they
also
indicated
that
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
act
would
not
be
a
defense
to
a
common
law
action
for
damages.
so,
i
think,
as
i
attempted
to
indicate
earlier,
congress
declared,
took
a
completely
different
approach
from
the
earlier
approach.
yes,
there
would
be
a
full
panoply,
a
comprehensive
regulatory
and
statutory
framework.
far
from
viewing
the
continued
existence
of
a
private
remedy
as
being
antagonistic
to
that,
as
i
believe
my
opponent
has
suggested,
congress
chose
to
permit
that
as
a
welcome
conflict,
if
indeed
there
was
a
conflict.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
there
had
been
no
such
cases
at
that
time.
but
we
would
submit
that
the
savings
clause
cannot
be
read
to
mean
that
it
only
preserves
rights
which
existed
as
of
the
date
of
its
enactment.
there
is
simply
nothing
to
suggest
that
this
court
today,
in
1981,
in
evaluating
our
case,
must
determine
what
rights
and
remedies
if
any
my
clients
had
in
1972
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
when
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicate
that
there
was
a
time
lock
on
a
court's
analysis
as
to--
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
--exactly.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
i
would
agree
that
if
it
was
a
true
savings
clause
it
would
be
that.
unfortunately,
that
misnomer,
as
i
have
phrased
it,
has
been
attached
and,
i
believe,
incorrectly.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
yes,
there
have,
your
honor.
we
cited
one
in
our
brief,
if
i
may,
the
byram
river
decision.
yes,
your
honor,
the
byram
river
v.
village
of
port
chester,
a
southern
district
of
new
york
decision
from
1975.
i
might
also
add
that--
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
--yes,
your
honor.
they
held
that
standing
to
sue
under--
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
--no,
your
honor.
the
specific
jurisdiction
for
the
district
court
was
under
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
was
proceeding
into
the
second
point
of
our
argument,
namely,
that
the
clauses...
i
hesitate
to
use
the
word
1972,
we
submit
clearly
and
unambiguously
indicates
that,
yes,
in
a
sense,
these
were
savings
clauses,
because
they
most
certainly
preserved
all
rights
and
remedies
existing
as
of
the
date
the
statute
was
enacted.
however,
they
do
not
have,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested,
a
time
lock
to
preclude
the
continued
availability
of
new
rights
and
remedies
which
might
be
developed
in
the
future
by
judge
made
law
under
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
i
would
not
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
sir,
particularly
if
one
remembers
the
history
of
the
development
of
this
statute.
the
previous
statute
was,
i
believe,
woefully
inadequate
both
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
area
covered
as
well
as
the
inadequate
remedies
which
were
provided.
indeed,
that
was
one
of
the
very
reasons
cited
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
illinois
v.
city
of
milwaukee
where
there
was
not
even
a
mandatory
conciliation
or
arbitration
type
provision
with
respect
to
disputes
over
interstate
pollution.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
yes,
i
do,
sir,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
so
called
conflict,
we
certainly
recognize
it
as
a
real
one,
but
would
submit
that
the
conflict
of
that
nature
already
exists
and
indeed
my
opponent
urges
that
it
continue
to
exist.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
greater
conflict
or
potential
conflict
with
respect
to
what
we
are
asking
than
the
situation
exists
under
illinois
v.
city
of
milwaukee
where
in
your
example,
if
i
may
borrow
it,
sir,
the
judge
says,
well,
i
can't
award
damages,
but
i'm
going
to
order
you
to
completely
stop
dumping,
and
therefore
be
limited
to
injunctive
relief.
i
believe
that
that
capability,
that
potential
for
conflict,
is
indeed
welcome.
to
cite
but
another
example,
that
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
the
states
are
free
to
adopt
more
stringent
limitations,
effluent
limitations,
than
are
prescribed,
if
at
all,
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
well,
before
that
question
is
reached,
sir,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
further
safeguard
for
that
person,
and
that
is
particularly
with
respect
to
the
standards
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
something
is
in
violation
of
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
or,
indeed,
constitutes
a
public
nuisance.
though
we
don't
believe
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
issue,
we
would
certainly
be
satisfied
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
standard
suggested
by
the
3rd
circuit
which,
as
you
know,
was
the
restatement
of
torts,
definition
of
a
public
nuisance.
not
only
must
the
existence
of
the
public
nuisance
be
determined,
but
the
comments,
the
official
comments
to
that
restatement
provision
suggest
that
where,
as
our
opponents
have
suggested,
there
is
a
comprehensive
legislative
or
regulatory
framework
which
has
been
imposed
to
prescribe
or
regulate
a
given
conduct,
the
courts
are
especially
loath
to
describe
the
conduct
regulated
as
being
a
violation
of
a
common
law.
so
i
do
not
see
that
there
would
be
any
particular
difficulty
with
a
federal
judge
being
confronted
with
that
situation.
we
will
frankly
concede
that
we
have,
even
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
findings
of
the
3rd
circuit,
my
clients
have
a
difficult
road
ahead
of
them
in
terms
of
the
evidentiary
burdens
to
be
overcome.
we
would
only
ask
that
we
be
given
the
opportunity
to
meet
those
burdens
at
trial.
one
other
comment
which
i
wish
to
address
with
respect
to
the
continued
need
for
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
as
my
opponent
has
indicated
previously,
the
state
authority
to
regulate
to
the
extent
to
which
it
exists
at
all
on
the
atlantic
ocean
goes
no
further
out
than
the
three
mile
limit.
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint
a
situation
where
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
pollution
within
that
three
mile
limit,
but
there
is
also
a
certain
degree
of
pollution
from
this
algal
bloom
in
the
next
area
going
geographically
from
the
shore,
and
that
is
in
the
12-mile-limit
area.
we
submit
that
the
only
law
which
can
apply
in
that
area
within
the
12-mile
limit
in
which
the
states
do
not
have
any
authority
to
regulate
has
to
be
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance,
and
indeed
the
geographic
area,
or
at
least
a
portion
thereof,
which
was
affected
is
precisely
one
of
the
remaining
interstices
in
which
the
federal
common
law
must
apply.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
we...
our
thrust
is
twofold.
contrary
to
the
assertions
in
some
of
the
briefs,
it
has
never
been
established
as
a
matter
of
record,
and
indeed
we
intend
to
plead,
as
we
have
alleged,
that
permits
under
both
statutes,
the
dumping
permits
under
the
ocean
dumping
act
and
the
permits
to
discharge
the
sewage
and
sludge,
that
those
dumping
and
discharging
activities
were
in
violation
of
permits
which
were
issued
as
well
as
the
rules
and
regulations
under
which
the
permits
are
issued.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
without
giving
the
60
days,
or--
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
--i
believe
we
could.
however,
we
may--
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
--well,
the
difficulty
with
that,
your
honor,
as
we
argued
unsuccessfully
to
the
district
court,
somewhat
more
successfully
to
the
3rd
circuit...
as
your
honor
may
recall,
the
<third>
[=
3rd]
circuit
indicated
that
could
have
been
an
alternate
basis
to
support
our
federal
statutory
claims.
we
filed
our
complaint
in
january
of
'77.
the
conduct
about
which
we
complain,
and
its
effect,
was
over
by
the
fall
of
1977.
it
was
rather
futile
to
request
an
end
to
the
activity
that
had
already
destroyed
the
fishing
industry
off
the
coast
of
new
jersey.
mr.
robert
p.
corbin
that's
correct,
sir.
and,
i
may
also
add
that
neither
of
the
two
statutes
permitted
private
damage
claims.
contrary
to
the
assertions
of
judge
conford
that
what
we
were
seeking
is
a
broad
and
far
ranging
sort
of
relief,
the
relief
which
we
request
and
which
we
submit
we
are
entitled
to
under
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
is
going
to
involve
a
relatively
small
class
of
individuals.
we
request
this
court
not
to
adopt
the
narrow
and
overly
restrictive
reading
of
the
rationale
of
this
court's
1972
decision
of
illinois
v.
city
of
milwaukee.
as
that
court
indicated,
it
was
not
merely
the
character
of
the
parties,
the
fact
that
a
plaintiff
was
suing
a
sovereign
entity
not
within
its
own
jurisdiction,
that
led
the
court
to
apply
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
the
court
held
there,
and
we
maintain
that
holding
is
applicable
here,
that
where
there
are,
such
as
here,
an
involvement
of
an
interstate
waterway,
particularly
a
situation
where
there
is
truly
an
interstice,
or
actually,
a
vacuum,
with
respect
to
the
non
application
of
any
other
law
other
than
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance,
that
certainly
the
rationale
of
the
city
of
milwaukee
decision
remains.
i
believe
my
time
has
ended,
unless
there
are
any
questions.
thank
you.
