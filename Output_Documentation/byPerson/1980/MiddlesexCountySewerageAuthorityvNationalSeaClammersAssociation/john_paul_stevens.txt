justice

before
you
finish
with
your
argument,
will
you
explain
your
position
with
regard
to
the
savings
clauses?
justice
stevens
but
are
you
saying
that
the
state
law
could
only
apply
in
an
interstitial
sense?
what
about
a
case
in
which
the
state
seeks
to
impose
common
law
rule
that
is
directly
governed...
say,
the
federal
permit
says,
ten
parts
and
the
state
common
law
rule
says--
justice
stevens
--more
strict?
more
strict?
if
you
comply
with
both,
by
complying
with
state--
justice
stevens
--even
though
it's
the
state
common
law?
justice
stevens
it
would
not
be
a
defense
to
the
state
common
law
action
if
there
was
compliance
with
a
federal
permit?
justice
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
before
you
leave
the
savings
clause,
you
construe
it
as
applying
only
to
preexisting
remedies.
was
there
a
previous...
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
was
there
a
remedy
for
violating
an
effluent
standard?
isn't
that
a
concept
that
was
created
by
the
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
the
rational
explanation
being
that
if
there
is
another
remedy
created
under
this
statute
to
enforce
an
effluent
limitation,
we
don't
want
to
tamper
with
that
remedy.
and
you're
saying,
yes,
but
the
only
other
remedy
under
this
statute
is
the
citizen
suit
provision:
there's
no
implied
remedy.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
don't
read
it
that
way,
that
language
is
clearly
superfluous.
it
would
mean
the
same
thing
if
you
just
took
out
"effluent
standard
limitations".
justice
stevens
mr.
corbin,
may
i
just
ask...
i
understand
your
common
law
theory,
but
your
statutory
theory,
your
implied
cause
of
action
theory,
do
you
allege
that
the
defendants
violated
the
effluent
limitation?
justice
stevens
are
you
still
able
to
make
those
claims
by
giving
the
60-day
notice?
justice
stevens
no,
with,
giving,
say
you
did
it,
you
gave
notice
today?
could
you
still
make
those
claims?
justice
stevens
why
couldn't
we
have
avoided
the
whole
implied
cause
of
action
issue
by
having
you
give
notice
a
couple
of
years
ago?
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see,
and
your
60-day...
that
claim
would
not
be
a
damage
claim,
would
it?
