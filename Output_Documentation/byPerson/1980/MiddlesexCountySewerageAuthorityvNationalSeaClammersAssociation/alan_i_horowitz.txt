mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
issue
of
the
existence
of
an
implied
private
right
of
action
under
the
clean
water
and
the
ocean
dumping
acts.
on
this
issue,
the
federal
petitioners
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
private
right
of
action
should
be
implied
under
both
of
these
statutes,
apart
from
the
citizen's
suit
provisions,
thus
enabling
the
respondents,
because
they
allege
economic
injury
from
pollution,
to
this
lawsuit
both
for
injunctive
and
monetary
relief
and
against
both
the
dischargers
of
pollution
and
the
government
agencies
responsible
for
administering
these
statutes.
the
standards
for
determining
whether
violations
of
a
regulatory
statute
might
form
the
basis
for
an
implied
private
right
of
action
are
by
now
well
established
by
this
court.
the
fundamental
inquiry
is
into
the
congressional
intent.
and,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
transamerica
cases,
when
congress
explicitly
provides
one
remedy
for
violations
of
a
statute,
it
is
strong
evidence
that
it
did
not
intend
that
another
private
remedy
be
implied.
in
this
case
there
can
be
little
doubt
regarding
congress's
intent.
both
statutes
contain
detailed
provisions
authorizing
suits
by
private
parties
as
an
aid
to
enforcement
of
the
statutes.
these
provisions
are
modeled
on
a
prototype
enacted
in
the
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1970
after
extensive
congressional
debate.
i
will
focus
here
on
the
specific
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
clean
water
act.
i
believe
a
similar
analysis
is
applicable
to
the
analogous
provision
under
the
ocean
dumping
act.
section
505
of
the
clean
water
act
authorizes
a
citizen
suit
only
in
certain
specified
circumstances.
a
citizen
may
sue
any
discharger
who
is
violating
an
effluent
limitation
established
under
the
act
or
a
related
order
of
the
administrator
of
epa.
the
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
in
such
suits
to
enforce
the
limitation
and
to
assess
the
civil
penalties
against
the
violator.
a
citizen
may
also
sue
the
administrator
himself
to
compel
him
to
perform
a
mandatory
duty
under
the
statute.
moreover,
the
act
establishes
certain
specific
procedural
limitations
on
this
action.
these
relate
to
notice
that
must
be
given
to
epa
prior
to
suit,
to
abstention
from
suit
when
the
government
is
pursuing
its
own
enforcement
remedies,
and
to
venue.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
nor
any
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
create
by
implication
yet
another
private
cause
of
action
for
claims
that
cannot
be
brought
under
the
citizen
suit
provision,
as
plaintiffs'
claims
in
this
case
concededly
were
not
brought
under
the
citizen
suit
provision.
the
savings
clause
to
which
respondents
point
as
authority
for
this
implied
right
of
action
means
simply
what
it
says.
preexisting
statutory
rights
and
common
law
remedies
are
preserved.
thus,
in
these
statutes,
congress's
intent
is
clear.
congress
carefully
considered
the
extent
to
which
it
wished
to
create
a
private
right
of
action,
and
it
intended
to
create
only
the
right
that
it
specified.
now,
in
our
brief
we
have
also
discussed
the
other
cort
v.
ash
factors
and
i
will
mention
here
only
that,
for
reasons
explained
there,
it
also
counsels
against
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action.
i
would
like
to
note
here,
however,
that
a
refusal
to
imply
the
private
right
of
action
sought
by
the
respondents
is
quite
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
these
statutes.
the
primary
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
clean
water
act
as
well
as
the
ocean
dumping
act
was
to
place
certain
federal
limitations
on
effluent
discharges
into
our
nation's
waters,
and
to
provide
for
enforcement
of
these
limitations.
congress
carved
out
a
role
in
this
scheme
for
citizen
participation
but
only
as
an
aid
to
enforcement,
for
which
the
primary
responsibility
rests
with
the
federal
government.
congress
did
not
deal
specifically
in
these
statutes
with
remedies
to
compensate
individuals
for
pollution
damage
that
they
suffer
except
to
note
that
the
act
did
not
take
away
any
existing
remedies.
thus
no
private
right
of
action
to
compensate
the
plaintiffs
need
be
implied.
other
remedies
which
were
preserved
by
the
savings
clause
are
their
recourse
for
the
adverse
effect
of
pollution
that
they
suffer.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
the
simplest
explanation
of
that
language
in
the
statute
is
that
the
citizen
suit
provisions
specifically
refer
to
suits
to
enforce
effluent
limitations.
that
is
the
only
type
of
suit
that
one
might
have
thought
would
have
been
preempted
by
that
language.
therefore
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
that
congress
used
the
words
"effluent
limitation"
again
in
the
savings
clause,
just
to
make
it
clear
it's
referring
back
to
the
original
language
in
the
citizen
suit
provisions.
now,
certainly--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
don't
think
it...
it
did
not
create
any
new
causes
of
action.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
savings
clause
didn't;
right.
but
it
intended
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--preserve
every
single
action
that
had
existed
before.
in
other
words,
to
make
clear
that
the
citizen
suit
provision
was
establishing
a
new
private
action
limited
to
those--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
citizen
suit
provision
refers
to
any
other
relief,
it
doesn't
refer
only
to
effluent
limitations.
it
does
refer
to
the
phrase
"effluent
limitation"--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--but
it
said...
i
don't
think
there
were
these
effluent
limitations
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
the
concept
didn't
exist;
that's
correct.
so
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
certainly,
the
common
law
nuisance
remedy
was
preserved;
also
any
remedy
relating
to
water
pollution
under
any
other
statute.
states
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--as
far
as
the
federal
common
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
the
illinois
v.
milwaukee
case
was
decided
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
statute--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
state
was
the
plaintiff.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
because
the
illinois
v.
milwaukee
case
was
only
decided
a
couple
of
months
before
it
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
far
as
i
know,
no
private
party
had
sought
to
invoke
that
decision
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
act.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
congress
was
just
making
it
clear
that
they
were
saving
whatever
there
was
to
save.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
court
gave
many
explanations
for
why
it
was
implying
common
law.
it
didn't
say
that
this
was
to
be
applied,
to
be
restricted
only
to
cases
that
could
otherwise
be
brought
under
the
original
jurisdiction,
and
the
reason
for
finding
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
was
because
of
the
overriding
federal
interest
in
interstate
pollution;
i
mean,
controlling
interstate
pollution.
i
don't
know
what
the
court's
reasoning
was,
but
they
didn't
say
that
they
were
doing
it
solely
to
divest
themselves
of
original
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
the
state
of
new
york
has
argued
in
its
brief
that
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
should
be
restricted
to
cases
that
could
otherwise
be
brought
under
this
court's
original
jurisdiction,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
that
and
i
don't
think
that
the
reasons
that
the
court
gave
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee
support
that
contention.
i
guess
i'm
starting
to
get
into
the
second
issue
here,
and
if
i
can
just,
if
i
could
respond
one
more
time
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question:
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
best
way
to
draft
the
savings
clause,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
they
used
the
word
"effluent"...
there
is
a
rational
explanation
for
their
use
of
the
words
"effluent
limitation".
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
just
seems
inconceivable
that
in
enacting
this
detailed
citizen
remedy
that
congress
intended
to
imply
some
other
remedy
without
saving
so,
and
by
doing
it
in
this
very
mystical
fashion,
using
the
word
"effluent
limitation"
in
the
saving
clause.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
clause
is
drafted
as
broadly
as
possible.
congress
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
they
weren't
taking
away
any
other
remedies.
now,
but...
there
may
be
some
superfluities.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
now...
well,
let
me
get
to
that
now,
i
guess.
on
the
issue
of
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance,
federal
petitioners
urge
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
now,
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee,
this
court
recognized
the
applicability
of
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
to
problems
of
interstate
pollution
because
of
the
overriding
federal
interest.
putting
aside
for
one
moment
the
question
of
whether
that's
since
been
preempted
by
congress,
the
question
here
is
whether
that
remedy
is
available
to
private
parties,
or
whether
it's
to
be
restricted
to
a
state,
the
context
in
which
it
was
previously
before
the
court.
extensive
water
pollution
does
not
respect
state
boundaries
as
it
travels
through
the
water.
now,
the
court
gave
several
examples
of
previous
decisions
where
it
had
noted
that
interstate
pollution,
both
air
and
water,
was
an
area
that
touched
upon
a
federal
interest
and
required
implication
of
a
federal
remedy.
in
the
words
of
judge
friendly,
"the
interstate
nature
of
the
controversy
here
makes
it
inappropriate
that
the
law
of
either
state
should
govern.
"
now,
given
the
existence
of
this
federal
common
law,
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
made
available
to
private
parties.
this
court
specifically
noted
in
the
milwaukee
case
that
the
existence
of
a
common
law
in
that
case
was
not
the
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
state.
the
interest
in
uniformity
and
difficulties
in
applying
state
law
equally
support
the
application
of
federal
common
law
whether
the
plaintiff
is
the
united
states
or
a
private
party.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
under
section
1331(a),
because
there's
a
federal
common
law.
the
reason
for
the
implication
of
the
federal
common
law
is
the
need
for
a
uniform
standard
to
apply
to
an
incident
of
interstate
pollution,
as
pollution
crosses
individual
state
boundaries.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
it
presents
a
federal
question,
the
federal
question
being
under
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i'm
not
seeking
to
overrule
erie
v.
tompkins.
there
may
be
federal
interests,
for
example,
the
united
states
as
a
plaintiff,
that
may
be
with
or...
as
an
intrastate--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
certainly,
where
a
private
party
brings
a
suit
and
there's
no
interstate
effects,
we
agree
that
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
does
not
apply.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
because
there's
no
federal
question.
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
does
not
apply.
so
a
suit
could
not
be
brought
in
the
federal
court,
it
would
be
restricted
to
a
state
remedy.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
points
on
the
preemption
argument
which
judge
conford
has
focussed
on.
first
of
all,
it
is
abundantly
clear
from
these
statutes
that
there
was
no
intent
to
preempt
the
common
law
of
nuisance,
neither
the
clean
water
act
nor
the
ocean
dumping
act.
this
is
clear
both
from
the
legislative
history
and
from
the
savings
clause,
and
in
the
clean
water
act
the
legislative
history
specifically
referred
to
actions
that
have
been
brought
under
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
now,
the
other
bases
that
are
ordinarily
looked
at
for
this
court
for
preemption,
at
least
in
the
state
context,
also
do
not
apply
here.
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
remedy
and
these
statutes.
similarly,
the
fact
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
that's...
considering
the
preemption
clause
i
think
it's
important
to
draw
a
distinction
between
whether
a
cause
of
action
for
nuisance
exists
at
all
and
what
standards
are
to
be
applied
on
the
merits
in
determining
whether
there's
a
nuisance.
now,
this
court
said
in
milwaukee
that
the
standards
established
under
the
federal
acts
will
be
highly
relevant
to
determining
whether
a
nuisance
exists.
now,
if
there's
a
permit...
and
i
should
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
discharges
were
in
violation
of
permits,
so
there
really
is
no
defense
at
all
because
of
the
permit.
if
there's
a
permit,
then
that
permit
is
relevant
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
nuisance
to
the
extent
of
what
epa
considered
in
issuing
the
permit.
now,
what--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--unless
he
found
some
deficiency
in
what
epa
did,
i
wouldn't--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
but
there
are
gaps
in
the
statute.
the
clean
water
act
does
not
control
every
kind
of
discharge.
there
are
certain
conditions
listed
in
our
brief
in
the
milwaukee
case,
but
there
are
certain
aspects
of
discharges
that
were
not
covered
by--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
perhaps
there's
a
little
confusion
here.
the
choices,
as
i
understand
it,
the
municipal
petitioners
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
no
nuisance
remedy,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
remedy
or
whether
the
plaintiffs
must
resort
to
a
state
remedy.
so
if
the
goal
of
uniformity
is
advanced
by
having
a
federal
remedy,
in
a
case
like
this
where
you
have
pollution
and
pollution
effects
in
two
different
states
as
well
as
in
the
ocean,
if
there's
a
federal
remedy,
this
can
all
be
resolved
by
one
judge
in
one
court
in
one
action.
if
there
are
state
remedies
there
will
have
to
be
a
suit
in
new
york,
i
suppose,
a
suit
in
new
jersey,
possibly
a
suit
in
federal
court.
and
the
result
may
be
three
different
determinations
by
three
different
standards,
all
to
the
same
conduct.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
think
the
uniformity
rationale
is
much
better
served
by
federal
action.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
you
would
have
uniformity
in
a
particular...
as
far
as
a
particular
pollution
incident.
now,
it's
possible
that
you
would
have
a
different
standard
applied
in
some
suit
in
the
state
of
washington
and
in
some
suit
in
the
state
of
florida,
but
the
clean
water
act
itself
takes
account
of
that
sort
of
disparity.
it
entitles
states
to
have
their
own
more
stringent
limitations
thank
you.
