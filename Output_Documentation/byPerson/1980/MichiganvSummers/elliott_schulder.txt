mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
brief
time
available
to
me
i
would
like
to
address
the
aspect
of
this
case
that
is
of
primary
concern
to
the
federal
government.
we
view
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
as
sweeping
well
beyond
the
context
of
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
michigan
supreme
court
properly
read
this
court's
decision
in
dunaway
v.
new
york,
to
hold
that
any
detention
of
a
suspect
beyond
a
momentary
stop
for
brief
questioning
is
not
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment,
regardless
of
its
reasonableness
unless
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
suspect
on
criminal
charges.
we
believe
that
this
decision
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
basic
approach
in
this
area
of
fourth
amendment
law,
and
that
it
unjustifiably
precludes
law
enforcement
officers
from
engaging
in
appropriate
and
legitimate
law
enforcement
investigative
activities.
in
dunaway
the
court
held
that
the
detention
of
a
suspect
for
custodial
interrogation
required
probable
cause
for
his
arrest.
we
believe
that
that
was
undoubtedly
a
correct
result.
the
detention
process
itself
is
an
unstructured
and
potentially
open
ended
one.
moreover,
as
justice
stevens
noted
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dunaway,
the
possibility
of
obtaining
a
confession
may
increase
in
direct
proportion
to
the
length
of
the
detention.
most
importantly,
we
submit,
the
police
could
prolong
investigative
stops
in
every
case
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion,
if
they
could
simply
justify
the
detention
on
the
need
for
continued
interrogation.
thus,
as
the
court
held
in
dunaway,
to
have
allowed
prolonged
detention
in
that
case
simply
on
the
justification
of
custodial
interrogation,
would
have
permitted
the
police
to
go
well
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
stop
standard
that
the
court
developed
in
terry
and
its
progeny.
however,
as
mr.
justice
white
emphasized
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
dunaway,
there
is
room
within
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
fourth
amendment's
reasonableness
standard,
to
accommodate
certain
exceptions
to
the
normal
rule
of
probable
cause
where
flexibility
is
essential.
terry
provides
a
case
in
point.
the
detention
in
terry
was
momentary.
it
occurred
as
the
officer
observed
terry
and
his
companions
parading
around
in
front
of
a
store
and
looking
as
if
they
were
about
to
commit
daylight
armed
robbery.
the
officer
in
that
case
approached,
asked
a
question
of
the
suspects,
and
when
the
suspects
muttered
a
response
he
seized
terry,
turned
him
around,
patted
the
outside
pockets
of
his
coat,
discovered
a
weapon.
that
detention,
although
it
took
only
several
seconds,
the
court
held
was
a
seizure
of
the
person
under
the
fourth
amendment.
however,
since
the
seizure
was
so
different
from
the
type
of
intrusion
that
accompanies
an
arrest,
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
narrow
exception
to
the
probable
cause
requirement,
and
that
reasonable
suspicion
alone
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
stop
and
the
frisk
of
terry.
now,
in
subsequent
cases,
the
court
has
applied
the
terry
reasonable
suspicion
standard
to
stops
of
automobiles
and
in
brignoni-ponce
the
court
noted
that
the
stop
in
that
case
involved
simply
the
asking
of
several
questions.
the
government
had
stated
that
the
stops
had
taken
usually
no
more
than
one
minute.
in
martinez-fuerte,
however,
involving
fixed
checkpoint
stops,
the
government
in
its
brief
pointed
out
that
the
average
length
of
detention
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
was
from
three
to
five
minutes.
that
was
at
the
secondary
area
where
the
officers
in
their
discretion
were
able
to
direct
drivers
over
for
further
investigation.
and
that
detention
occurred
without
any
requirement
of
reasonable
suspicion
at
all.
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
this
case
held
that
any
detention
for
more
than
a
brief
or
momentary
period
is
per
se
unreasonable
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
without
regard
to
the
particular
circumstances
that
may
justify
the
detention.
we
believe
that
this
approach
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment's
central
notion
of
reasonableness,
it's
also
unduly
restrictive
of
legitimate
law
enforcement
activities.
there
are
numerous
occasions
when
a
suspect's
responses
to
an
officer's
questions
may
intensify
the
officer's
suspicions
and
yet
not
necessarily
provide
probable
cause
to
arrest.
in
these
situations
the
police
may
attempt
to
maintain
the
status
quo
for
a
limited
period
in
order
to
determine
whether
to
arrest
or
release
the
suspect.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
have
given
several
examples,
such
as
the
situation
where
the
police
responding
to
a
report
of
a
burglary
or
robbery
see
a
suspect
near
the
scene
of
a
crime,
pick
him
up,
and
return
him
to
the
scene
for
possible
identification
at
a
show
up.
similarly
there
is
a
situation
involving
a
computer
check
where
the
police
stop
an
automobile
which
they
suspect
reasonably,
but
have
no
probable
cause
to
believe,
is
stolen.
they
then
radio
in
to
headquarters
for
a
check
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
automobile
has
been
reported
as
stolen.
under
the
michigan
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case
these
reasonable
examples
of
good
police
work
would
not
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
we
wish
to
stress
that
our
position
here
will
not
leave
the
police
in
an
unstructured
situation
where
they
may
arbitrarily
detain
suspects
for
extended
periods
on
no
more
than
a
whim.
in
the
first
place,
the
officer
must
have
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
the
individual
is
involved
in
criminal
activity
before
he
may
stop
the
individual
for
brief
inquiry.
in
order
to
detain
the
individual
further
after
the
individual
has
responded
to
the
officer's
questions
the
officer
must
have
in
mind
a
specific,
independent
avenue
of
investigation
that
requires
the
continued
presence
of
the
suspect,
and
that
is
reasonably
likely
to
resolve
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other,
that
is,
whether
to
release
or
arrest
the
suspect
within
a
relatively
short
time.
the
police
may
not
detain
a
suspect
on
the
basis
of
a
vague
hope
that
somehow
evidence
of
his
criminal
conduct
will
materialize.
this
case
provides
a
good
illustration
of
a
situation--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--we
have
not
addressed
the
situation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
under
our
rationale,
the
police
would
not
be
authorized
to
stop
a
person
simply
because
he
happens
to
be,
and
detain
a
person
for
the
entire
duration
of
the
execution
of
the
warrant,
simply
because
he
happens
to
be
leaving
the
premises.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
if
the
police
made
inquiry
and
determined
that
the
person
lived
on
the
premises
or
had
some
kind
of
ongoing
connection
with
the
premises--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--oh.
certainly.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
detention
in
this
case
fits
perfectly
within
our
theory,
that
is,
as
the
respondent
was
leaving
the
house,
the
police
stopped
him,
they
ascertained
that
he
lived
on
the
premises,
and
they
detained
him
there
during
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
we
justify,
in
contrast
to
the
state,
the
primary
justification
for
the
detention
in
our
view...
and
i'd
like
to
address
something
that
justice
white
had
mentioned
earlier...
our
primary,
the
way
we
view
the
case,
the
primary
justification
for
detention
here
is
to
see
whether
or
not
the
police
would
have
sufficient
evidence
to
arrest
the
respondent
after
the
search
was
completed.
we
believe
that--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
we
would
still
say
that
detention
of
a
person
for
the
period,
of
a
person
connected
with
the
premises
for
the
period
of
ascertaining
whether
there
was
or
was
not
drugs
or
other
contraband
sought
in
the
warrant,
would
still
be
reasonable.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
suppose
you
found
the
heroin
and
then
you
were
able
to
discover
that
he
in
fact
was
connected
to
the
heroin?
mr.
elliott
schulder
by
asking,
by
inquiring
of
the
suspect;
that's
correct.
that
will
certainly
provide
proper
support--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
we
would
agree
with
that
submission.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we're
not
saying
that
the
police
would
not
be
able
to
search
people
in
the
house
if
they
have
sufficient
basis
to
believe
that
the
people
may
have
weapons
on
their
persons.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
would
agree
that
a
policeman
would
properly--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--for
his
own
safety;
and
the
fourth
amendment
would
not
preclude
him
from
taking
that
type
of
action.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
might
be
true.
thank
you.
