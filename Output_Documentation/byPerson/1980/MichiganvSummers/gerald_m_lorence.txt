mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
the
court
first
on
the
detention
matter.
the
search
warrant
was
obtained
for
actions
that
took
place
the
night
before
at
this
residence
of
the
respondent.
under
michigan
law
an
affiant
or
an
informant
through
an
affiant,
in
this
case
it
was
the
affiant
police
officer,
went
to
a
magistrate
and
presented
what
he
swore
to
occurred
the
night
before
the
alleged
entry
with
the
search
warrant.
under
michigan
law
such
actions
must
satisfy
the
examination
of
the
magistrate,
who
is
the
issuing
force
for
a
search
warrant.
in
this
particular
case
a
search
warrant
was
issued
under
the
authority
of
a
magistrate
for
the
premises
for
the
purposes
of
searching
the
premises
only...
and
that
"only"
is
just
my
word...
to
seize,
secure,
tabulate,
make
return
according
to
law,
of
the
following
property
and
things.
one,
heroin;
two,
any
other
narcotic
material
and
paraphernalia.
nothing
more.
now,
if
that
examining
magistrate
was
sufficiently
convinced
that
a
search
warrant
should
be
issued
for
persons
or
a
person,
that
would
have
been
done.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
just
like
ybarra,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
just
like
ybarra.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
greg
was
the
bartender.
the
search
warrant
specified
the
bartender,
greg,
in
the--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--not
if
they
want
a
search
warrant.
in
this
particular
case
they
wanted
a
search
warrant
for
the
premises.
if
they
have
names
of
persons
or
a
person
with
a
sufficient
description
that
satisfies
the
requirement
of
the
magistrate,
such
search
warrant...
and
it's
very
common
in
michigan
and
in
detroit,
where
this
case
originated,
for
the
search
warrant
to
specify
not
only
the
contraband
to
be
seized
and
that
the
house
be
searched
for
such
items,
but
also
any
person
or
persons.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
place
to
be
seized,
and...
place
to
be
searched
and
a
person
to
be
seized.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
person,
contrary
to
what's
been
said
here,
should
have
and
does
have
greater
rights
in
his
residence,
in
a
private
place,
than
in
a
public
place.
ybarra
guarantees
the
fourth
amendment
rights
to
the
patrons
of
that
bar
and
the
prosecutor...
or,
it
is
the
petitioner
here,
is
asserting
that
a
person
in
his
own
private
dwelling,
or
in
this
particular
place
in
this
particular
situation,
outside
the
private
dwelling,
has
less
rights.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
that
may
be
so,
but
i
think--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--the
individual,
wherever
he
is,
has
a
right
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
don't
think
just
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
lives
in
a
house...
and
that's
the
only
information
that
the
police
officers
had
when
they
detained
and
seized
the
respondent
in
this
case...
was
sufficient
probable
cause,
and
it
wasn't
a
reason
to
detain
him,
and
wasn't
a
reason,
wouldn't
be
a
reason
to
search
him.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
in
this
particular
situation,
after
the
search
warrant
was
gotten,
and
they,
the
police
officers...
and
you're
talking
about
seven
police
officers,
a
precinct
narcotic
unit,
coming
up
the
street,
getting
out
of
their
vehicles,
and
stopping
and
detaining
the
respondent
in
this
matter
outside
the
premises.
i
think
they
had
a
right--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--knowing
that
he
just
came
out
of
the
house.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
that's
what
they
said,
that
they
saw
him
coming
out
of
the
house.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
we--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--yes.
we
call
it
curtilage.
i
know
this
court
hasn't
spoken
of
curtilage,
probably,
in
40
or
50
years,
but
he
was
not
inside
the
premises,
he
wasn't
on
the
porch,
he
was
on
the
sidewalk
going
to
the
street.
detroit
is
uncommon
to
many
other
places
in
terms
of
the
way
people
live
in
housing
structures.
we
have
a
predominance
of
single
dwelling
homes
in
our
city
as
opposed
to
washington
or
new
york,
where
there
are
many
apartment
structures,
and
sometimes
the
buildings
come
right
up
to
the
sidewalk.
here
we
have
a
single
dwelling
home
in
a
residential
area,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
across
the
street
from
a
school,
and
there
is
a
porch
that
comes
out
of
the
house,
then
there
are
steps,
and
then
there
is
a
walk
down
to
the
common
sidewalk
that
goes
along
the
street
and
then
some
area
between
that
sidewalk
and
the
street.
now,
when
the
police
officers
came
up
and
detained
mr.
summers,
they
had
a
right
under
terry
to
do
that.
i
believe
they
do.
and
they
had
a
right
to
give
him
a
search,
a
pat
down,
for
a
weapon.
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
did
not
feel
that
they
were
in
any
danger,
and
they
did
not
feel
that
it
warranted
a
search
or
pat
down.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
under
the
situation
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
i
think
under
certain
cases
there
are
limited
inquiry.
i
mean,
this
court
has
spoken
about,
doesn't
a
police
officer
have
a
right
to
come
up
to
an
individual
on
the
street
and
ask
him
a
question?
now,
the
respondent
here
wasn't
exactly
on
the
street,
but
i
do
think
that
they
had
a
right
to
come
up
and
inquire.
they
made
an
inquiry.
do
you
live
here?
the
respondent
said,
yes,
i
live
here.
now,
i
think
that
the
police
officers
had
a
right
for
a
brief
momentary
detention
to
inquire,
to
guarantee
their
safety,
to
find
out,
who
is
this
man?
at
that
particular
point,
i
think
that
is
legitimate
police
inquiry.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
but
they
didn't
inquire
anything.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
after
that,
that
detention
was
a
seizure
and
it
was
in
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
right.
and
i
feel
that
under
circumstances
that
seizure
took
place
the
minute
they
turned
him
around,
and
they
took
him
back
onto
the
porch.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
whether
or
not
this
was
an
illegal
detention?
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
have
any
probable
cause
to
detain
him
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
of
the
respondent.
and
in
your
particular
situation
i
think
they
would
have
even
less
to
detain
him.
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
they
detained
him
was
an
intrusion
on
his
expectation
and
right
of
privacy.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
unless
they
had
anything
further;
unless
they
had
probable
cause
to
do
what
they
did.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
said,
yes.
i
think
they
could
ask
to
have,
the
police
had
a
right
to
ask
him.
if
i
understand
your
question,
they
asked
him
a
question
which
i
believe
they
legitimately
had
a
right
to
ask.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
correct.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
this
court
has
already
responded
in
terms
of
a
situation
like
that.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
he
could
have
said,
goodbye.
i
don't
want
to
answer
your
questions,
and
walk
off;
at
least,
try
to
walk
off.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
that
would
be
a...
i
think
that
would
be
evasive
and
give
the
police
room.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
at
10:10
p.m.
on
a
dark
night,
coming
out
of
this
house?
i
have
some
question
about
that.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
that
whether
of
not
he
responds
either
way,
they
have
a
right
to
ask
that
question
and
he
has
a
right
to
answer
any
way
he
wants.
i
don't
believe
that
it
gives
any
reason
for
the
police
to
be
suspicious,
to
detain
him,
to
take
him
back
into
the
premises.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
say
that.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
they
have
a
search
warrant
for
the
premises.
they
didn't
have
a
search
warrant
for
him,
they
didn't
even
have
any
description
in
their
search
warrant
that
a
person
of
the
respondent's
character
and
description
was
wanted.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
so
i--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--in
this
particular
situation
of
the
respondent,
they
didn't
have
any
probable
cause.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
i
think
if
there
is
probable
cause,
that
there
is
a
reason
to
detain
him,
at
least
momentarily.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
make
a
terry-type
stop
and
investigation.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
no,
i
think
with
the
probable
cause
that
you
have
indicated--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--no,
you
indicated
that
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
the
detention
in
the
case
of
the
respondent
with
a
search
warrant
in
the
hands
of
the
police
officers
is
different
from
the
circumstance
that
has
been
given
by
justice
white.
and
i
think
that
there
isn't
any
probable
cause
in
the
case
of
the
respondent
in
my
case
and
there
wasn't
any
reason
to
detain
him,
they
didn't
have
any
probable
cause.
just
the
fact
that
he
lived,
he
said
that
he
lived
in
the
premises.
i
think
you
have
a
situation
where
there
is
someone
who
indicates
that
someone
was
murdered
in
this
house,
where
you
do
have
probable
cause.
and
i
think
you
have
a
right
to
detain.
there
are
certain--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--i
think
it
comes
down
to
the
intrusion
on
a
person's
right
against
an
illegal,
unreasonable
stop
and--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--i
think
that
it
comes
down
to
any
situation
where
somebody
coming
out
of
the
premises,
like
in
the
particular
case
of
the
respondent,
where
they
do
not
have
probable
cause
in
terms
of
the
respondent
or
any
person
that
comes
out,
that
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
detain
any
more
than
to
make
the
inquiry
of
whether
or
not
you
live
there
or
what
your
name
is,
or
what's
your
address,
or
to
secure
that
person
in
terms
of
any
potential
weapons,
if
the
police
officers
think
that
they
have
weapons.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
outside
the
house,
your
honor?
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
don't--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--no,
i
don't
think
that
they
should
have
turned
him
loose.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
they
should
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
search
him.
they
did
not
have--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--well,
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that.
they
knew
where
he
lived,
they
had
the
ability
to
get
his
name
and
address.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
all
right,
they--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--inside
the
house?
i--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--they
should
have
advised
him
of
his
miranda
warnings,
because
a
police
officer
said
that
he
made
an
initial--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--i
don't
think
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
that
they
had
no
other
choice
than
to
let
him
go.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
back,
your
honors,
to--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--if
i
was
correct,
they
wouldn't
have
taken
him
inside
the
premises.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
right.
now,
let's
go
back
to
the
detention.
the
detention
outside
the
premises
involved
taking
of
the
respondent
back
onto
the
porch
and
using
him
as
an
instrument
to
gain
entry
into
a
premises.
now,
we've
been
talking
and
the
solicitor
general's
been
talking
about
duration,
in
terms
of
dunaway.
i
think
that
there
is
duration
here
but
i
think
there
is
something
more
grievous.
i
think
the
fact
that
this
precinct
narcotic
team
armed
with
flak
jackets,
long
guns,
guns
drawn,
and
a
battering
ram,
coming
up
the
walk,
detaining
the
respondent--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--yes,
but
taking
this
civilian,
not
knowing
who
he
is
other
than
the
fact
that
he
resides
in
the
house,
i
don't
think
under
any
rule
justifies
taking
him
to
that
front
door,
using
him
as
an
instrument
to
gain
entry--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--but
battering
that
door
down,
knowing
as
this
court
has
said
many
times
what
kind
of
actions
and
activities
go
inside
a
place
where
drugs
are
kept
or
sold,
placed
the
respondent
in
a
situation
where
he
could
have
been
the
first
one
to
catch
a
salvo
of
gunshots
and
been
killed
right
on
the
spot.
i
think
that--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
police
officers
in
their
difficult
task
take--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--and
that's
why
terry
has
become
a
limited
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
but
here
you
have
a
man
who
has
not
taken
on
the
responsibility
and
the
dangerous
responsibility
that
police
officers
take
on,
who
is
made
a
volunteer
who
is
placed
in
front
of
that
door.
he
presses
that
doorbell,
yes,
and
the
man
that
comes
to
the
door
sees
that
there
are
people
on
that
porch,
slams
the
door,
the
battering
ram
goes
in,
and
mr.
summers
is
kept
right
there,
without
a
flak
jacket,
without
any
responsibility,
to
take
care
of
himself.
he's
placed
in
a
position
where
i
can't
think
of
anything
that's
more
serious
than
this
in
terms
of
denying
his
personal
liberties.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
believe
that
the
detention--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--i
think
the
detention,
the
violations
of
his
fourth
amendment
right
were
so
severe
outside
the
premises
that
their
taking
him
into
the
premises
denied
him--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--if
they
had
left
him
without
any
controls,
without
any
threat,
then
he
was
left
to
go
his
way
and
to
exercise
his
freedom
of
movement.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
no,
i
think
any--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--yes,
the
same
argument.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes,
i
do.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
well,
if
he
had
given
them
the
key,
i
think
they
still
could
not
have
seized
him,
detained
him,
and
taken
him
back
into
the
premises.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
that's
correct.
they
didn't
do
that.
i
think
the
detention,
once
they
went
onto
the
porch
and
took
him
onto
the
porch,
i
think
that
was
the
detention,
the
seizure,
and
the
arrest.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
he
had
a
right
to
keep
the
key.
i
don't
think
he
had
a
duty
to
give
them
the
key.
i
don't
think
he
had
a
duty
to
help
them
open
up
the
door.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
i
think
perhaps
they
could
have
inquired
but
they
didn't,
in
this
particular
matter,
inquire
beyond
the
fact
about,
if
whether
or
not
he
lived
in
the
premises,
and
whether
or
not
he
could
open
up
the
door.
i
think
each
human
being
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
which
is
guaranteed
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
any
kind
of
intrusion
beyond
the
exceptions
that
have
been
carved
out
by
this
court,
like
the
border
cases,
like
the
terry-type
search,
i
think
are
a
violation
of
the
person's
expectation
of
privacy,
of
his
person.
i
think
in
this
particular
situation
the
respondent
came
out
of
his
premises
late
at
night.
he
had
every
expectation
of
privacy
as
he
was
coming
down
the
steps
of
his
home,
and
down
the
sidewalk,
and
when
the
officers
detained
him
i
think
that
violated
his
fourth
amendment
right
to
privacy.
i'm
sorry,
isn't
the
red
light
at--
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
--all
right,
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
being
a
colonial
response
to
the
english
practice,
against
general
warrants,
is
a
firm
basis
for
this
court
to
continue
the
practice
of
holding
that
the
fourth
amendment
guarantees
each
individual
a
right
to
be
secure
in
his
person,
his
house,
his
papers,
and
effects,
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
carve
out
another
exception
in
the
terry
line,
in
the
border
cases.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
but
i
don't
think
that
it
was
depriving
a
person
of
his
guaranteed
right
to
be
free
from
any
seizures
or
searches?
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
right.
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
continue
protecting
an
individual's
fourth
amendment
right
and
not
expand
the
doctrine
of
terry
v.
ohio
and
the
border
cases,
and
expand
upon
those
to
create
anything
in
terms
of
a
good
faith
exception
or
a
balancing
test,
because
i
believe
that
if
police
officers,
in
a
situation
like
the
respondent's,
who
have
a
search
warrant
for
the
premises,
detain
and
deprive
a
person
of
their
right
of
privacy
on
the
outside
of
the
premises
for
which
they
have
a
search
warrant,
they
could
stop
not
only
the
mailman
but
a
lady
with
a
baby
buggy,
or
a
nine
year
old
boy
coming
out
of
the
premises,
and
take
him
back
into
a
situation
that
would
be
dangerous
and
also
search
him.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
search
warrant
for
the
premises
under
our
law
in
the
state
of
michigan,
permit
a
search
beyond
the
bounds
that
are
outlined
in
a
search
warrant.
and
in
this
particular
case
the
search
warrant
said,
premises.
it
didn't
say
anything
about
persons
coming
out
of
the
premises,
and
i
think
the
police
officers
had
a
duty
to
let
that
person
go
after
they
inquired
as
to
who
he
was
and
were
sufficiently
satisfied
that
that
person
wasn't
a
danger
to
them.
they
didn't
search
mr.
summers
for
any
weapons
when
he
was
stopped
on
the
sidewalk,
so
they
didn't
feel
the
danger,
as
in
terry.
mr.
gerald
m.
lorence
yes,
i...
they
decided
on
the
detention
matter
and
they
found
that
there
was
an
illegal
detention
and
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
on
that
basis
they
made
their
decision.
thank
you,
your
honors.
