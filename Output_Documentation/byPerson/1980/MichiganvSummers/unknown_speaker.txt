unknown
speaker
this
would
go
to
anybody
who
was
on
the
premises?
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory,
if
there
were,
let
us
say,
six
or
eight
men
in
the
house
and,
as
the
officers
entered,
all
of
them
rushed
toward
the
door
and
wanted
to
get
out,
they
could
be
stopped
long
enough,
on
your
theory,
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
supports...
you
don't
think
you
could
hold
a
person
just
because,
if
you
find
something
in
the
house,
you
could
arrest
the
owner
of
the
house?
unknown
speaker
that's
another
argument?
unknown
speaker
right;
right.
going
back
to
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
which
by
coincidence
happens
to
be
the
same
number,
is
it
your
theory
that
if
the
eight
people
immediately
wanted
to
dash
out
of
the
house,
the
officers
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
which
was
the
owner
or
who
were
the
owners,
and
therefore
they
could
detain
all
of
them
long
enough
to
consummate
the
execution
of
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baughman,
is
there
a
presumption
in
michigan
that
the
owner
of
the
house
is
responsible
for
what's
in
it?
unknown
speaker
in
thought
that
would
be
a
solution
to
your
problem.
unknown
speaker
did
you
present
this
first
theory
that
you
are
presenting
to
us,
below?
unknown
speaker
that
was
rejected?
unknown
speaker
but
the
way
the
events
happened,
they
didn't
search
the
men
until
after
they
had
found
something
else
in
the
house?
unknown
speaker
they
just
held
them?
although
you
would
have
said,
you
could
search
him
immediately?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baughman,
on
this
first
theory,
is
this
just
the
theory
you
advance
with
respect
to
a
home?
you
wouldn't
make
the
same
argument
in
a
commercial
establishment,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
how
you
distinguish
ybarra,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baughman,
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
you
when
you
apply
for
the
warrant
to
ask
the
magistrate
to
include
in
the
scope
of
the
area
to
be
searched
all
persons
found
on
the
premises?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
done
here?
unknown
speaker
or
in
clothes
in
the
closet.
unknown
speaker
of
course--
unknown
speaker
--the
magistrate
would
normally
assume
you'd
search
the
nightstands.
would
the
magistrates
in
michigan
normally
assume
that
everybody
in
the
premises
would
also
be
searched?
unknown
speaker
isn't
this
really
a
question
of
construing
constructing
the
warrant?
which
would
be
kind
of
a
matter
of
local
practice,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
you've
got
me
confused.
but
they
didn't
search
him
until
after
they
found
the
dope?
unknown
speaker
so
they
didn't
assume
that
this
warrant
authorized
them
to
search
him?
right?
unknown
speaker
but
we're
reviewing
here
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
supreme
court
of
michigan,
are
we
not?
because,
since
they
took
the
case
and
decided
it
on
a
different
ground
than
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
so,
in
effect,
you
would
say,
they
necessarily
rejected
this
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
rejected
in
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
added
before
that
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
at
the
threshold
who
is
the
owner
or
who
are
the
owners,
and
who
may
be
customers,
visitors,
or
neighbors.
unknown
speaker
how
long
a
period
do
you
have
to
resolve
that
dilemma?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
search
and
find
that
the
man's
got
a
big
packet
of
heroin
in
his
pocket,
do
you
mean
they're
not
going
to
arrest
him?
unknown
speaker
he
would
be
arrested,
then,
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--in
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
but
how
would
a
person
satisfy
the
officers
on
the
ground
at
the
time
that
he
was
neither
the
owner
nor
had
any
connection
with
the
premises
if
it
turned
out
that
he
had
no
contraband
on
his
person?
unknown
speaker
but
he
would
have
been
detained
long
enough
to--
unknown
speaker
--submit
to
the
search.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
take
it
your
second
position
is
that
even
if
they'd
have
searched
him
on
the
doorstep
and
found
nothing
on
him,
that
you
would
have
been
authorized
to
hold
him
until
the
search
of
the
house
was
over?
unknown
speaker
yes.
on
the
grounds
that
if
you
find
something
in
the
house
you
will
have
reasonable
cause
to
arrest
him.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
if
they
searched
him
right
away,
they
could
say
that
nevertheless
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
a
fellow
says,
i
just
want
to
go
on
my
way.
i'm
going
to
get
in
my
car
and
drive
away.
unknown
speaker
only
for
safety
reasons?
unknown
speaker
because
you
may
be
able
to
arrest
him?
unknown
speaker
or
that
he
can.
unknown
speaker
seems
to
me
that
you
must
reach
the
detention
issue
before
you
reach
your
warrant
issue,
because
the
defendant
wouldn't
have
been
on
the
premises
if
you
hadn't
detained
him.
he
was
outside
when
you
met
him.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
warrant
gives
you
the
right
to
search
people
out
in
front
of
the
building?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
he
get
inside?
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
so
it's
anybody
who
was
in
the
premises
at
any
time
after
the
warrant
is
issued?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
deliveryman
leaving
the
premises?
does
it
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
he
said
he
was
a
resident,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
sort
of
the
rule
that
applies
here?
unknown
speaker
suppose
on
the
mailman
circumstance
that
you
described,
and
assume
that
the
house
had
been
under
surveillance
for
three
or
four
hours
and
the
surveilling
officers
who
were
there
before
the
warrant
was
executed
had
reported
to
the
senior
official
that
the
mailman
had
been
in
the
house
for
three
hours,
then
there
might
be
some
reasonable
ground
to
think
that
the
mailman
was
not
engaged
in
the
delivery
of
mail,
would
it
not?
and
would
you
say
they
might
be
able
to
search
him?
unknown
speaker
he
might
be
delivering
something
other
than
mail?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
ought
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
mailman
and
the
man
in
the
mailman's
uniform,
because
if
he's
a
legitimate
mailman
and
you
arrest
him,
i
think
you're
going
to
be
in
a
little
trouble.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that's
what
the
chief
justice
meant
was
the
man
in
the
uniform.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baughman,
did
they
search
the
other
six?
unknown
speaker
they
searched
those?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
michigan
law,
or
are
there
some
limits
under
michigan
law
as
to
whom
you
can
arrest
if
you
find
heroin
in
his
house?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
michigan
law,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
of
michigan?
we
haven't
anything
to
do
with
that.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
detaining
him
didn't
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
then
could
he
be
arrested,
and
then
could
he
be
searched?
unknown
speaker
but
the
dissenters
did
reach
that
question?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
consenters
conceded
that
under
michigan
law
something
found
in
the
basement
of
the
house
owned
by
somebody
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
that
somebody
of
possessing--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
baughman,
have
you
told
us
how
long
respondent
was
detained
before
he
was
searched?
unknown
speaker
is
signed
at
what
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
do
you
adopt
the
state's
first
position?
i
don't
think
you
quite
are
adopting
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
specifically,
could
they
detain
someone
leaving
a
house
because
they
had
a
warrant
to
search
the
house,
under
your
rationale
you're
now
advancing?
unknown
speaker
that
would
not
constitute
sufficient
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
had
some
connection
to
criminal
activity?
unknown
speaker
which
they
did
here.
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
was
clear
fourth
amendment
law
to
the
effect
that
just
because
you
discover
heroin
in
a
house
doesn't
mean
you
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
anybody
on
the
premises?
unknown
speaker
why?
if
you...
suppose
you
found
the
heroin
but
you
still
couldn't
arrest
him?
unknown
speaker
by
asking?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
position
is,
though,
that
at
least,
if
you
found
heroin
in
the
house,
you
should
be
able
to
arrest,
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
owner?
unknown
speaker
let
me
give
you
a
slightly
different
hypothetical.
you
have
a
warrant
to
search
a
house
owned
by
a
named
and
described
person
for
weapons
thought
to
be
on
the
way
to
delivery
to
the
ira
in
ireland.
would
not
the
police
be
able
to
search
every
person
in
that
house
immediately
on
the
terry
concept?
unknown
speaker
i'm
giving
you
the
facts.
would
a
policeman
in
his
right
mind
not
want
to
search
every
person
in
that
house
if
they're
there
for
the
purpose
of
finding
weapons
that
would--
unknown
speaker
--for
his
own
safety?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
different
for
the
search
for
some
other
kind
of
a
commodity.
unknown
speaker
is
it
frequent,
frequent
in
michigan
that
search
warrants
are
issued
to
search
people?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this--
unknown
speaker
--well,
usually
if
you've
got
probable
cause
to
think
somebody's
got
contraband
on
them
you
get
an
arrest
warrant,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
warrant
should
specify
the
places
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
to
be
seized.
now,
is
that
what
you
do
in
michigan?
unknown
speaker
you
specify
the
persons
to
be
seized--
unknown
speaker
--or
searched?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
different.
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
a
public
place
like
a
bar,
the
bar
in
ybarra,
and
a
private
dwelling?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
to
the
notion
that
in
a
public
bar
or
restaurant
there
is
no
assumption
that
any
one
of
the
individuals
has
any
connection
with
or
knowledge
of
the
others,
whereas
in
a
private
home,
if
you
have
eight
people
there,
there
is
some
possibly
reasonable
assumption
that
they
have
some
connection
with
each
other,
or
they
wouldn't
be
gathered
there?
unknown
speaker
may
be?
or
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
in
the
constitutional
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
order
for
any
sort
of
detention
to
take
place?
unknown
speaker
knowing
that
he
just
came
out
of
the
house?
unknown
speaker
no
dispute
about
that?
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
premises
in
the
sense
that
he
is
on
the
land
to
which
that
house
is
attached?
on
the
door
step?
unknown
speaker
was
he
or
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
that
the
only
thing
that
you
can
do
on
less
than
probable
cause,
then,
is
a
pat
down
for
weapons?
unknown
speaker
well,
generally?
i
mean,
how
about
martinez-fuerte,
brignoni-ponce,
pennsylvania
v.
mimms?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
fact
that
he
lives
there
and
they
have
a
warrant
to
search
the
place
for
drugs?
doesn't
that
permit
further
inquiry
of
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
that
permit
further
detention
of
him?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
make
any
difference,
then,
whether
he
lived
there
or
not,
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
said
that,
i
do
not
live
here?
you
would
say
they
could
not
detain
him.
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing
when
he
answered
that
he
could
live
there.
unknown
speaker
i'm
merely
saying
that,
as
i
understand
your
theory,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
said
he
lived
there
or
that
he
did
not
live
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
if
their
detention
was
to
simply
question
and
ask
him
whether
he
lived
there,
and
the
reply
under
your
theory
was
bound
to
be
unhelpful
for
the
police
one
way
or
the
other.
why
do
you
say
they
had
a
right
to
ask
him
whether
he
lived
there
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
my
brothers
blackmun
and
rehnquist
are
correct,
aren't
they,
in
what
their
question
suggests,
that
if
you
are
correct,
that
it
was
violative
of
your
client's
constitutional
rights
to
seize
him
after
he
said,
yes,
he
lived
there?
certainly
you
would
be
correct
if
the
answer
had
been,
no,
i
don't
live
here.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
what
the
answer
to
the
question
was.
unknown
speaker
while
the...
certainly
the
police
were,
as
you
can
see,
were
free
to
ask
the
question,
it
was
kind
of
a
pointless
question
if
whatever
the
answer
was,
they
were
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
your
submission.
i
understand
that.
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
he
says,
i'm
just
an
encyclopedia
salesman,
and
was
only
in
the
house
for
a
few
minutes,
do
they
have
to
believe
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
might...
let's
assume
he
might
be
an
encyclopedia
salesman.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
say
that,
when
he
said,
no,
i
live
here,
it
was
a
violation
of
his
rights.
but
you
suggest
it
would
not
have
been
if
he'd
said
he
didn't
live
there
but
was
just
a
casual
visitor,
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
just
now.
how
can
that
follow?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought
your
position
was.
well,
that's
a
meaningless
charade,
then.
you
say
they
have
a
right
to
ask
him
the
question
but
regardless
of
what
answer
they
get
from
him,
they
can
do
nothing
that
they
couldn't
have
done
had
they
never
asked
the
question
in
the
first
place.
that's
your
position?
what
if
he
said,
it's
none
of
your
business?
unknown
speaker
and
that
doesn't
give
the
officers
any
extra
reason?
that's
what
you
suggest?
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
police
have,
are
suddenly
told
by
a
man
who
comes
into
the
police
station
that
he's
just
come
from
an
address,
and
he
knows
that
one
of
the
undercover
agents
has
been
murdered
in
that
house
by
somebody
in
that
house.
he
doesn't
know
who
did
it,
but
he
knows
he's
dead
and
somebody
did
it
there.
and
they
go
to
the...
and
everybody
agrees
there's
probable
cause
to
go
search
the
house,
and
they
get
a
warrant
to
search
the
house,
and
as
they
approach
here
come
six
people
out
of
the
house.
can't
they
detain
them
until
they've...
all
they're
trying
to,
see
if
there's
a
dead
man
in
the
house?
you
say,
no,
absolutely
not.
unknown
speaker
they
have
probable
cause,
everybody
concedes
that
probable
cause
to
believe
that
somebody
in
that
house
killed
somebody
and
that
the
body's
there.
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
my
question?
unknown
speaker
each
person?
each
person
until
they
find
the
body
and
then
try
to
figure
out
who's
responsible?
do
they
have
to...
can't
they
hold
them
for
a
reasonable
time
to
inquire,
to
see
if
they
can
find
out
which
of
the
six
people
may
be
implicated?
or
maybe
they
all
are?
unknown
speaker
then
that's
all?
if
the
fellow,
if...
in
my
example,
if
six
people
exit
from
the
house
and
they
want
to
inquire,
make
some
inquiries
from
them,
and
each
of
them
says,
none
of
your
business,
they
must
let
them
go?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
probable
cause
as
i...
the
only
facts
i
changed
was
change
cocaine
or
drugs
to
a
murder.
that's
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
probable
cause,
i
said
there
was
a
murder
in
the
house
and
that
somebody
in
the
house
was
responsible
for
it.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
heroin
or
a
dead
body,
for
these
purposes,
if
that's
the
information?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference?
in
each
case
it's
a
felony,
one
a
little
more
gruesome
than
the
other,
perhaps,
and
i'm
not
sure
which
is
worse.
but
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it's
all
right
to
intrude
if
maybe
there's
a
dead
body
in
there
but
it's
not
all
right
to
intrude
if
there
is
a
lot
of
heroin?
unknown
speaker
i've
got
a
real
problem.
the
police
have
a
search
warrant
to
search
this
house
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
they
search
the
house
and
they
found
the
heroin.
right?
and
this
man
said
he
lived
in
that
house.
what
should
the
police
then
do?
say,
would
you
mind
waiting
here
until
we
get
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
this
very
case.
after
they
found
the
heroin,
what
should
they
have
done
insofar
as
this
man
was
concerned?
turned
him
loose?
unknown
speaker
say,
bye
bye,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
should
they
have
done?
unknown
speaker
what
should
they
do
with
him
in
the
meantime?
turn
him
loose?
unknown
speaker
they
had
his
name
and
address
then.
unknown
speaker
what
should
they
have
done?
unknown
speaker
no,
sir.
my
story
is,
after
they
found
the
heroin
and
they
came
out
and
looked
at
him
and
said,
you're
the
one
who
said
you
lived
in
that
house,
right?
at
that
stage,
what
should
they
have
done?
unknown
speaker
and
could
they
have
arrested
him
after
the
miranda
warnings?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
should
they
do,
let
him
go?
unknown
speaker
but
to
let
him
go?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
final
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question
is
that
they
simply
have
to
let
him
go
at
that
point?
well,
if
you're
correct,
they
wouldn't
have
had
him,
he
wouldn't
have
been
there.
unknown
speaker
he
wouldn't
have
been
there
at
the
time
they
discovered
narcotics
in
the
basement.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
correct.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
narcotic
trade
uses
those
too,
you
know.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
didn't
work.
unknown
speaker
that
sometimes
has
happened
to
the
officers
on
the
outside
when
they
made
the
entry
on
the
inside,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
rationale
of
chief
justice
warren
in
terry,
to
try
to
make
sure
that
at
least
the
odds
are
leveled
off
between--
unknown
speaker
--and
for
that
reason
we
should
reverse
his
conviction
for
heroin?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
something
missing
in
between
those
two?
unknown
speaker
would
your
case
be
the
same
if
they
didn't...
if
they
had
left
him
outside
in
the
street
sitting
on
a
featherbed?
would
your
position
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
i
said.
i
said,
instead
of
taking
him
to
the
front
door,
they
had
held
him
sitting
on
a
featherbed
on
the
porch.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
oh,
you
think
this
just
adds
on?
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
they
used
him
at
the
door?
what
if
they'd
simply
asked
him
for
the
key,
if
he
said
he
lived
there?
unknown
speaker
that
would
obviate
the
necessity
for
his
going
back
and
himself
ringing
the
doorbell
and
exposing
himself
to
all
this
possible
danger
which
you
have
just
described.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
had
asked
him
for
the
key
and
he'd
said,
i
have
it
but
i
won't
give
it
to
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
his
refusal
to
give
them
the
key
would
have
given
the
police
grounds
for
any
additional
inquiries
or
any
additional
detention?
unknown
speaker
to
continue
the
practice
adopted
in
1961
in
mapp
v.
ohio?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
think
we
were
doing
in
mapp
v.
ohio?
we
were
certainly
rewriting
something
in
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
no.
it
was
imposing
a
requirement
on
the
states
that
hadn't
previously
been
imposed
on
them.
we
overruled
wolff
v.
colorado
and
imposed
upon
the
states,
presumably
as
part
of
the
constitution,
the
obligation
to
enforce
an
exclusionary
rule.
that's
what
mapp
v.
ohio
did.
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
decided
this
case
on
federal
grounds
only?
unknown
speaker
we
have
just
heard
from
michigan
counsel
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
decision
rested
on
federal
grounds.
unknown
speaker
and
on
no
state
ground?
unknown
speaker
well,
since
when
do
we
dismiss
in
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
but
the
highest
court
in
the
state
has
now
certainly
given
some
indication
that
it
thought
it
was
necessary.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
reasonable
or
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
infer
from
that
that
they
thought
they
had
to
reach
the
federal
grounds?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
the
states'
highest
courts,
and
particularly
this
one,
in
my
observation,
goes
out
of
its
way
to
avoid
a
remand,
and
put
it
on
state
grounds,
if
they
can
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
with
justice
williams'
dissent
at
appendix
27,
where
it
says,
after
his
name,
"for
reversal"?
i
would
assume
from
that
that
he
thought
that
if
his
principles
were
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
reversed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ennis,
supposing
we
sent
it
back
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
we
don't
care
to
decide
the
michigan
view,
we
think
that
federal
law
requires
this
result.
we
decided
the
case
on
that
ground,
that's
our
opinion,
and
we're
not
going
to
say
anything
about
state
law.
they
can't
make
us
say
anything
about
state
law.
how
can
we
tell
them
to
decide
it
on
state
law
grounds?
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
its
judgment
will
stand
and
it
will
stand
on
federal
grounds.
unknown
speaker
if
we
find
that
this
writ
is
improvidently
granted,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
line.
it
wouldn't
go
back
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
what
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
on
your
submission,
mr.
ennis,
every
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
highest
court
of
a
state
placing
it
openly
on
federal
grounds
and
on
federal
grounds
and
on
no
state
grounds
would
then
lead
us,
if
not
require
us,
to
remand
to
say,
isn't
there
a
state
ground
on
which
you
can
reach
this
result?
unknown
speaker
are
those
judgments
before
us?
unknown
speaker
are
those
judgments
before
us?
unknown
speaker
the
lower
court
judgments?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
solve
the
problem?
we
can
only
pass
on
one.
unknown
speaker
and
the
one
that
we
have
before
us,
would
you
agree
that
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
to
point
out
that
they
were
ruling
on
federal
and
not
state
grounds?
unknown
speaker
and
if
that's
true,
why
send
it
back
and
say,
is
that
what
you
were
doing?
unknown
speaker
but
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
didn't
do
that
here.
and
in
zucchini,
which
we
decided
two
or
three
years
ago,
which
came
up
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
we
said
that
there
may
be
adequate
state
grounds
for
it,
but
the
ohio
court
placed
it
on
federal
grounds,
and
we
will
decide
the
federal
question
so
that
the
state
court
will
feel
free
to
decide
it
under
state
law,
knowing
there
is
no
federal
impediment.
unknown
speaker
but
why
didn't
they
do
it
here?
unknown
speaker
where
does
this
suggestion
of
yours
stop?
every
time
there's
a
decision
rested,
rested
affirmatively
on
a
federal
ground,
what
are
we
to
do?
vacate
and
send
back
to
a
state
court
and
say,
now,
look,
maybe
you
could
have
rested
this
on
a
state
ground
and
until
you
tell
us
you
can't
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
the
federal
question?
does
it
go
that
far?
unknown
speaker
have
we
had
anything
like
this
before,
where
it
was
suggested--
unknown
speaker
--but
as
justice
marshall
suggested
to
you,
is
not
the
fact
that
two
lower
state
courts
decided
on
other
grounds
make
it
more
apparent
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
went
out
of
its
way
to
put
it
on
federal
grounds
and
to
reject
the
state
grounds?
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
did
not
want
to
get
into
the
facts,
but
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you
that
i
put
to
your
colleague.
suppose
a
warrant
were
to
search
for
machine
guns
and
hand
grenades
that
were
about
to
be
sent
to
the
ira
in
ireland,
and
they
send
a
team
of
seven
or
eight
officers
out,
adequately
prepared
for
that.
then
do
you
think
they
may
not
detain
the
man
at
the
door?
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
"george"
named
by
the
informant,
by
the
affiant.
unknown
speaker
the
warrant
didn't
authorize
any
search
or
seizure
of
george,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
and
was
george
ever
found?
unknown
speaker
he's
not
involved
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
know
this
is
the
only
george
of
the
search,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
people
in
that
business
don't
usually
give
their
right
names.
unknown
speaker
but
the
warrant,
in
any
event,
didn't
authorize
any
search
or
seizure
of
any
person,
george
or
anybody
else?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock
[=
10:00].
