mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
few
moments
to
review
the
facts
in
this
case.
but
before
i
do
i
would
like
to
first
state
concisely
the
framework
in
which
the
state
of
michigan
views
this
case.
we
view
this
as
a
warrants
case
involving
an
issue
as
to
the
scope
of
the
search
allowed
under
a
warrant
which
is
directed
at
premises
involving
an
issue
as
to
the
authority
given
to
the
executing
officers
by
the
warrant
itself
to
detain
persons
on
or
departing
from
the
premises
for
a
period
of
time
reasonable
and
necessary
to
insure
the
full
and
faithful
execution
of
that
warrant.
now,
the
facts
are
these.
one
october
tenth
at
approximately
10:10
p.m.
a
team
of
detroit
police
officers
arrived
at
a
residence
in
the
city
of
detroit
to
execute
a
search
warrant
for
narcotics
and
narcotics
paraphernalia.
the
affidavit
in
support
of
that
warrant
indicated
that
a
purchase
of
heroin
had
been
made
inside
that
residence
the
day
previous
from
a
black
male
known
as
george.
as
the
officers
arrived
to
execute
the
warrant
they
observed
respondent,
george
summers,
come
out
of
the
house
and
proceed
down
the
front
steps.
they
stopped
him
and
asked
him
if
he
lived
in
the
house.
he
answered
affirmatively
and
was
shown
a
copy
of
the
search
warrant
and
asked
if
he
could
get
the
officers
inside
the
house.
he
responded
that
he
had
left
his
keys
inside
but
could
ring
someone
over
the
intercom.
he
did
so
and
a
person
later
known
to
be
dwight
calhoun
answered
the
door
by
opening
the
inner
door.
he
realized
the
officers'
authority
and
purpose.
he
slammed
that
door
shut
and
the
door
was
then
broken
down
by
the
police.
mr.
summers
was
then
brought
inside
the
dwelling
and
taken
into
the
living
room.
once
the
premises
were
secured,
and
by
that
i
mean,
once
mr.
summers
and
the
other
seven
persons
who
were
present
in
the
house
at
the
time
were
gathered
in
the
living
room,
one
officer
as
part
of
his
duties
in
executing
the
warrant
went
to
the
basement
to
search,
and
there
he
found
heroin,
in
the
basement.
mr.
summers
was
then
arrested
for
the
possession
of
this
heroin,
the
heroin
found
in
the
basement,
and
a
search
of
his
person
incident
to
that
arrest
revealed
heroin
also
in
his
jacket
pocket.
it
was
the
heroin
in
his
jacket
pocket
which
ultimately
formed
the
basis
of
the
charge
against
him.
he
was
bound
over
for
trial
on
that
charge
but
the
charge
was
dismissed
by
the
trial
judge.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
dismissal,
holding
that
the
arrest
for
possession
of
the
heroin
in
the
basement
was
without
probable
cause
because
the
officers
did
not
possess
sufficient
facts
to
sustain
conviction
on
that
charge.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
also
rejected
the
argument
that
mr.
summers
could
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
itself.
the
michigan
supreme
court
granted
leave
on
those
issues
but
decided
the
case
on
a
different
issue
after
this
court's
decision
in
dunaway
v.
new
york,
holding
that
the
initial
detention
of
mr.
summers
when
he
was
brought
from
the
porch
inside
the
house
was
without
probable
cause
and
that
being
without
probable
cause
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
this
court
then
granted
certiorari.
it
is
our
position,
first,
that
the
search
of
mr.
summers
was
justifiable
under
the
search
warrant
itself,
that
a
search
warrant
for
private
premises
allows
a
search
of
reasonable
scope
and
intensity
of
persons
present
on
the
premises
where
the
items
particularized
in
the
warrant
might
be
found
on
the
person.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
officers
in
this
case--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct,
anyone.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
it
would
be...
in
this
case
there
in
fact
were
eight
persons
on
the
premises,
and
under
our
first
argument
the
search,
that
the
people
could
be
searched
under
the
warrant
itself,
all
those
persons
pockets,
their
outer
clothing,
could
be
searched
for
the
items
named
in
the
warrant,
assuming,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
items
are
of
the
type
which
could
be
concealed
or
found
on
the
person.
if
there
was
typewriters
or
something
like
that,
then
they
could
not
be
searched,
because
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
expect
to
find
the
items
on
the
person.
the
officers
did
not,
of
course,
in
this
case
search
mr.
summers
on
the
basis
of
the
warrant,
but
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
officers
have
the
subjective
legal
justification
which
supports
their
action
so
long
as
we
objectively,
the
law
does
support
the
action
which
was
taken.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
that
the
search
warrant
does
support
the
search
of
mr.
summers.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it's
first
our
position
that
without
regard
to
whether
they
had
found
the
heroin
in
the
house
they
could--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes,
that
they
could
have
searched
mr.
summers
simply
as
they
could
have
searched
a
nightstand
or
a
desk
drawer
because
the
heroin
could
be
inside.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
it
would
be
our
theory,
as
i
will
explain
more
fully
in
a
moment,
that
even
if
a
person
were
to
say,
i
am
not
the
owner,
i
am
a
visitor
or
i
am
a
neighbor,
that
the
officers
would
not
have
to
rely
on
that
declaration,
but
that
they
would
nonetheless
be
allowed
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
to
search
all
the
persons
present
on
the
premises
for
the
items
named,
in
this
case
for
heroin,
if
the
items
might
be
found
on
the
person.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
there's
not.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
unfortunately,
no,
there's
not.
in
fact,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
in
part
on
the
fact
that
under
a
peculiar
michigan
law
it's
circumstantial
evidence.
michigan
holds...
however,
there's
some
dispute
as
to
this...
that
you
need
to
negative
all
theories
consistent
with
innocence
to
support
a
conviction
on
circumstantial
evidence.
and
therefore,
ordinarily,
when
there
is
more
than
one
occupant
of
the
home,
you
can't
convict
anybody
for
possession
of
an
item
found
in
a
common
area.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
was
rejected
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
although
the
michigan
supreme
court
granted
leave
on
that
issue
and
in
fact
did
not
grant
leave
on
the
detention
issue,
which
they
ultimately
decided
the
case
on.
they
didn't
reach
the
search
warrant
issue.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
they
did
not
search
them--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
we
would
take
that
position,
although
we
will
also
argue
alternatively
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
wrong
in
assuming
this
court
would
reject
the
ground
that
he
could
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant.
then
we
will
argue
that
he
nonetheless
could
have
been
detained,
and
once
the
heroin
was
found
in
the
basement
they
did
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him,
and
discover
the
heroin
in
his
pocket.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
we
would
not
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
and
let
me
turn
quickly
to
ybarra.
in
that
case,
of
course,
this
court
held
that
a
search
warrant
for
ybarra
did
not
permit
a
search
of
the
patrons
in
the
bar.
we
believe
first,
that
this
is
distinguishable
in
that
mr.
summers
had
a
relationship
to
the
premises
in
this
case,
the
premises
to
be
searched,
and
that
he
was
an
occupant
owner
of
the
premises;
whereas
the
patrons
in
the
aurora
tap-tavern
in
ybarra
had
no
nexus
to
the
premises
at
all.
under
a
traditional
scope
and
intensity
analysis,
a
search
warrant
allows
the
search
of
places
within
the
premises
where
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
items
might
be
found.
of
course
you
can't
search
for
typewriters
in
desk
drawers
but
you
could
search
for
packages
of
heroin
in
desk
drawers.
we
believe
that
ybarra
should
be
read
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
to
find
items
named
in
a
search
warrant
on
patrons
in
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
but
we
do
contend
that
the
showing
of
probable
cause
which
was
required
to
justify
the
intrusion
into
the
private
dwelling
in
this
case
should
be
viewed
as
comprehending
within
its
scope
a
search
of
persons
on
the
premises
who
have
a
nexus
to
the
premises--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct,
sir.
that
could
be
done,
but--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that
was
not
done
here.
but
our
point
is
that
a
search
warrant
is
ia
an
anticipatory
authorization
to
search.
for
example,
you
would
not
have
to
state
in
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
or
have
detailed
in
the
authorization
that
you
wish
to
search
all
nightstands
found
in
premises,
or
you
would
not
have
to
detail
that
you
wish
to
search
all
closets
or
all
shelves.
the
warrant
authorizes
that
by
allowing
a
search
of
the
premises.
now,
if
persons
may
be
searched
under
a
warrant
for
premises
because
the
items
might
be
found
on
their
person,
as
they
might
be
found
in
desk
drawers
or
nightstands--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--correct.
--then
i
don't
believe
that
adding
that
language
necessarily
serves
any
purpose,
although
of
course
we'd
be
very
happy--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--if
the
police
had
done
that.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i
don't
think
they
would
assume
that.
i
don't
know
if
they
would
assume--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
i
think...
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
particularity
requirement
prevented
them
from
viewing
a
warrant
for
premises
as
including
the
persons
on
the
premises
within
it,
but
they--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--they
said
the
particularity
requirement
referred
to
marin
v.
united
states,
so
i
think
they
were
referring
to
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
that's
correct.
that
is,
the
police,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
did
not
search
mr.
summers
on
the
basis
of
the
warrant,
but
i
think
that
search
can
nonetheless
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
warrant,
because
his
persons
person
is
a
place
within
the
premises
where
the
items
might
be
found.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
the
michigan
supreme
court
granted
leave
on
the
search
warrant
issue
but
didn't
reach
it.
i
find
their
failure
to
reach
it
somewhat
inexplicable
because
i
believe
that
an
adverse
decision
on
the
detention
issue,
as
they
decided,
doesn't
necessarily
end
the
case
if
in
fact
mr.
summers
can
be
searched
on
the
authority
of
the
warrant.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
that
could
fairly
be
said,
that
it
needed
to
be
reached
and
wasn't.
i
can't
really
explain
exactly
why
they
didn't,
but
i
don't
believe,
if
this
court
were
to
find
or
that
court
were
to
find
that
mr.
summers
could
have
been
searched
under
the
warrant,
then
their
decision
on
the
detention
issue
did
not
end
the
case,
or
solve
the
case,
and
of
course
our
cert
petition
raised
all
three
issues,
which
this
court
granted.
i
believe
the
issue
is
properly
here.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
was
rejected
in
the
court
of
appeals,
explicitly.
the
nexus
to
the
premises
distinction,
which
i've
just
made
as
to
why,
as
to
how
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
ybarra,
because
mr.
summers
did
have
a
nexus
to
the
premises,
is
a
sufficient,
but
we
submit
it
to
be
not
a
necessary
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
because
we
believe
that
more
importantly,
as
i
mentioned
earlier
to
mr.
justice
stevens
in
answer
to
his
question,
is
the
fact
that
this
was
a
private
residence
rather
than
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
the
difficulty
with
the
relationship
of
to
the
person
to
the
premises
or
the
nexus
test
is
that
in
most
cases
the
police
will
not
have
any
idea
of
the
relationship
of
the
people
to
the
premises,
and
in
fact
people
may
lie
about
their
relationship
to
the
premises
if
questions
are
asked.
as
judge
campbell
said
in
the
micheli
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
"when
the
stranger
in
the
betting
parlor
solemnly
announces
that
he
is
the
family
doctor,
i
would
not
require
the
police
to
believe
him
or
inquire
further
before
searching
his
bag.
"
now,
that
case,
of
course,
involved
the
search
of
personal
effects
rather
than
the
person,
but
i
believe
the
logic
of
the
decision
applies
also
to
persons.
if
a
person
is
to
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant,
a
nexus
test,
we
believe,
is
not
an
appropriate
test
to
be
required,
that
this
court
should
allow
the
to
search
of
the
person
on
the
premises
simply
because
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
items
named
in
the
warrant
might
be
in
their
pockets.
particularly
when
a
knock
and
announce
requirement
is
considered,
and
michigan
has
a
knock
and
announce
statute
and
case
law
which
requires
that
the
officers
wait
until
a
person
in
the
room
furthest
from
the
door
can
get
to
the
door
to
answer
it.
particularly
when
those
requirements
are
considered,
the
authority
to
search
persons
on
the
premises
makes
sense.
i
would
hasten
to
add
here
that
although
i
am
pointing
out
that
the
fact
that
the
warrant
could
be
frustrated
is
a
justification
for
allowing
a
search
of
persons
on
the
premises,
it's
not
the
sole
one.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
allow
a
search
of
persons
on
private
premises
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
simply
because
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
persons
on
the
premises
might
have
the
items
on
their
person.
people
are
protected
by--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
in
this
case--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it
would
be
our
position
that
the
police
do
not
have
to
resolve
that
dilemma.
they
may
simply
search
all
the
persons
on
the
premises,
the
outer
clothing,
for
the
items
named
in
the
warrant.
because
as
judge
campbell
said,
the
police
shouldn't
be
allowed
necessarily
to
even
believe
what
they're
told,
if
they
make
inquiry,
because
they
may
be
lied
to.
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
inquire
further
or
to
believe
the
questions.
they
should
simply
be
allowed
to
search,
make
a
reasonable
search
for
the
items.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
then
these...
the
person--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--he
may
be
arrested
for
possessing
the
heroin;
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
for
example,
in
this
case,
if
the
officers
had
immediately
searched
mr.
summers
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
rather
than
searching
the
basement
first
and
finding
heroin,
and
found
the
heroin
in
his
pocket,
he
would
have
been
arrested
for
possessing
that
heroin.
the
search
warrant
gave
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
heroin
on
the
premises
and
one
place
it
was
was
in
his
pocket,
and
he
would
be
arrested
for
possessing
it.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
if
he
had
no
contraband
on
his
person
i'd
assume
that
he
would
not
be
arrested
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
to--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--be
searched.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
but
in
many
occasions,
i
would
imagine,
a
search
warrant
may
be
authorized
for
a
particular
place
or
a
particular
person
where
in
fact
there
is
no
contraband
and
none
will
ever
be
found.
a
person
will
have
submitted
to
the
search
and
nothing
will
have
been
found
and
they
will
go
on
their
way
and
there
will
be
no
arrest.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
and
if--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it's
not
our
position
that
that's
why
he
can
be
held
during
the
search
to
see
if
they
might
later
arrest
him.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
in
order
to
assure
the
full
and
faithful
execution
of
the
warrant,
that
all
the
persons
on
the
premises
should
be
able
to
be
detained
during
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
it
avoids
frustration
in
that
the
items
could
be
picked
up
and
hidden,
and
to
protect
the
officers,
while
they
execute
the
warrant,
from
people
milling
about
or
even
from
going
outside
and
causing
them
some
harm.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
wait
here
until
we
execute
the
warrant.
stay
in
the
spot.
you,
officer,
watch
these
eight
people
while
we
execute
the
search
warrant,
and
then
when
we're
done
you
can
be
released.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think,
and
i'll
turn
to
the
second
argument
now,
that
the
police
have
the
right
to
say,
you
can
go
on
your
way
when
we're
done
here,
but
in
the
meantime
wait
until
we
finish--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--for
safety
reasons
and--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
i
think
because
he
may
be
able
to
frustrate
the
warrant.
if...
let
me
turn
to
the
second
argument
and
assume,
assume
that
this
court
holds
that
a
person
cannot
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
or
that
he
can.
and
he
has
been
and
there's
nothing
found
on
his
person.
in
this
case,
there
were
eight
people
on
the
premises,
and
since
only
dwight
calhoun
and
mr.
summers
were
charged,
i'm
assuming,
i
believe
the
record
indicates
that
the
other
six
were
searched,
after
the
heroin
was
found
in
the
basement,
that
nothing
was
found
on
them,
and
they
were
allowed
to
go
on
their
way.
but
they
were
detained.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--no,
but
i
think,
i
would
argue--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
would
argue
that
the
warrant
gives...
if
the
warrant
gives
authority
to
search
people
on
the
premises,
it
also
gives
authority
to
search
those
who
come
out
of
the
premises
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
officers
as
they
approach.
for
example--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--no,
not
necessarily.
i
think
if
a
person
were
to
approach
the
premises
after
the
officers
were
already
executing,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
give
them
grounds
to
search
those
persons.
it's
persons
on
or
departing
from.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
would
say--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
would
think
that
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
unless
under
a
particular
case
it
was
clear
to
any
reasonable
man
that
this
person
could
not
have
any
connection
with
the
premises
at
all.
a
man
in
a
mailman's
outfit
is
walking
out
with
a
pouch.
i
think
they
could
not
search
him
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant,
but
if,
as
the
officers
approached
to
execute
a
search
warrant,
a
suitcase
came
flying
out
the
window,
i
would
think
that
the
fact
that
the
suitcase
is
now
outside
the
premises
would
not
remove
it
from
coverage
of
the
warrant,
because
it
had
just
been
inside.
if
person
can
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant,
the
fact
that
they
were
observed
to
depart
in
the
eyes
of
the
officers
as
they
approached
shouldn't
moot
the
question.
the
question
remains,
can
they
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
or
can't
they?
we
submit
that
they
can.
but
even
if
they
can't,
or
if
they
have
been
and
nothing
found,
we
submit
that
in
this
case
that
respondent
could
be
searched
and
that
the
heroin
in
his
jacket
pocket
was
nonetheless
properly
discovered
because
the
warrant
itself
should
be
viewed
as
granting
authority
to
the
executing
officers
to
detain
persons
on
or
departing
from
the
premises
for
a
period
of
time
which
is
reasonable
and
necessary
to
insure
the
full
and
faithful
execution
of
the
warrant.
and
we
say
that
without
regard
to
any
individualized
suspicion
that
any
particular
person
on
the
premises
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
what
we're
asking
for
is,
rather
than
a
necessarily
a
case
by
case
analysis,
is
for
this
court
to
recognize
a
generic
class,
if
you
will,
of
detentions
forfeiting
the
seizure
of
the
person
which
are
reasonable,
although
there
is
not
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
person,
or
necessarily
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
they're
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
now,
with
mr.
summers,
he
had
said
that
he
lived
in
the
home
and
had
left
his
keys
inside,
and
there
having
been
a
purchase
of
heroin
made
the
day
before,
it
could
be
argued
that
there
was
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
was
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
but
as
to
the
other
six
people
in
the
house,
perhaps
you
couldn't
say
that.
but,
nonetheless,
we
would
argue
that
all
those
persons
could
be
detained
in
the
living
room,
as
they
were,
for
a
period
of
time
reasonable
and
necessary
to
allow
the
officers
to
fully
execute,
and
safely
execute
the
command
of
the
court
which
ordered
them
to
search
the
premises
without
regard
to
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes,
under
those
circumstances
they
would.
i
think
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
our
position
is
that
the
police
should
be
able
to
detain
anyone
on
or
departing
from
the
premises
for
a
period
of
time
reasonable
and
necessary
to
insure
the
full
and
safe
execution
of
the
warrant.
in
the
circumstances
that
your
honor
has
described,
i
think
that
would
fit
that
test.
it
would
be
necessary
to
detain
the
mailman
in
order
to
fully
and
faithfully
execute
the
warrant,
although
i
think
in
that
example
also...
back
to
our
first
issue,
the
search
warrant,
that
the
mailman
under
those
circumstances
could
probably
be
searched
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant
if--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
believe
that's
probably
correct.
i
think
that
the
example
given
was
probably
a
courier
acting
as
a
mailman.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
our
position
is,
on
this
detention
issue,
that
the
fourth
amendment
contains
two
separate
and
independent
clauses,
a
reasonableness
clause
and
a
warrant
clause,
and
that
the
warrant
clause
is
textually
linked
to
the
probable
cause
concept,
but
that
arrests,
seizures
of
the
person,
do
not
generally
fall
within
the
warrant
clause
and
that
even
when
they
do,
as
in
payton
v.
new
york,
the
concern
of
the
court
is
not
with
the
warrantless
seizure
of
the
person
but
with
the
warrantless
entering
into
the
dwelling
to
effectuate
that
arrest.
so
we
believe
that
seizures
of
the
person
should
be
reviewed
for
reasonableness
and
that
detention
of
the
persons
on
or
departing
from
private
premises
when
a
search
warrant
is
about
to
be
executed
is
a
class
of
reasonable
detentions
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we
go
through
a
number
of
cases
from
this
court
in
our
brief,
and
this
court
always
expresses
the
test
as
striking
a
balance
between
the
public
interest
and
the
individual's
right
to
personal
security
free
from
the
arbitrary
interference
by
law
enforcement
officials.
and
we
believe
that
the
teaching
of
those
cases
is
that
detentions
are
constitutional,
if
reasonable.
and
that
reasonableness
is
a
balancing
between
governmental
interest
and
the
individual's
interest
in
personal
liberty.
the
more
severe
the
intrusion,
the
more
information
and
the
higher
the
governmental
interest
that's
required
to
justify
it.
arrest
to
hold
someone
to
answer
for
a
crime
requires
what
we
would
call
probable
cause
in
the
traditional
sense,
because
as
stated
by
chief
justice
warren
in
the
terry
case,
an
arrest
is
the
initial
stage
in
a
criminal
prosecution
and
it
is
inevitably
accompanied
by
future
interference
with
the
individual's
freedom
of
movement,
whether
or
not
trial
and
conviction
ultimately
follows.
detentions
for
custodial
interrogations,
as
this
court
held
in
dunaway,
require
traditional
probable
cause
because
they
are
in
many
respects
indistinguishable
from
an
arrest
to
hold
someone
to
answer
for
a
crime.
other
classes
of
detentions,
this
court
has
held,
do
not
require
probable
cause
in
the
traditional
sense,
terry
stops,
certain
sorts
of
border
stops.
and
we
submit
that
a
search
warrant
itself
should
be
viewed
as
authorizing
a
class
of
reasonable
detentions,
as
i've
said,
those
detentions
which
are
reasonable
and
necessary
for
the
full
and
safe
execution
of
the
warrant.
that
authority
should
be
implied
from
the
fact
of
the
warrant
itself.
the
governmental
interest
in
allowing
this
class
of
detentions,
we
believe,
is
a
weighty
one,
insuring
the
full
execution
of
the
warrant,
avoidance
in
many
cases
of
frustration
of
the
warrant...
since,
as
i've
said,
the
police
have
to
knock
and
announce.
and
even
in
this
case,
although
mr.
summers
was
coming
out
of
the
premises
as
the
officers
approached
and
we
don't
know
what
he
had
seen
or
hadn't
seen,
it
is
certainly
not
inconceivable
that
he
saw
the
eight
officers
arriving,
and
put
the
item
in
his
pocket
and
attempted
to
leave.
and
it's
certainly
not
inconceivable
that
were
he
allowed
to
go
about
his
business
outside,
that
he
might,
as
the
michigan
supreme
court
dissenters
noted,
summon
aid
to
interfere
with
the
execution
of
the
warrant
or
interfere
with
it
himself
from
the
outside.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
they
did
after
they
found
the
heroin
in
the
basement.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
person
outside
the
premises
might
be
more
dangerous
than
persons
inside
the
premises,
so
i
don't
believe
that
the
fact
that
mr.
summers
was
coming
out
changes
our
position.
persons
on
or
departing
from
the
premises
should
be
able
to
be
detained
to
insure
the
full
execution
of
the
warrant
and
the
faithful
execution
of
a
warrant.
a
magistrate
has
determined
in
this...
after
all,
in
these
cases,
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
items
related
to
criminal
activity
may
be
found
on
the
premises.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
there's
some
controversy
as
to
that.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
held
that
you
couldn't
even
arrest
the
owner
because
you
wouldn't
have
sufficient
facts
to
convict.
we
believe
they
applied
the
wrong
standard,
three
justices
in
the
michigan
supreme
court.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
michigan...
i
believe
that's
an
incorrect
statement
in
this
particular
case
also
of
michigan
law.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i
believe
that
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
mr.
summers
was
properly
detained
initially,
then
i
think
what
this
court
could
do--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--didn't
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
as
the
michigan
supreme
court
held,
then
the
issue
that
would
remain
would
be,
could
he
be
arrested
validly
on
probable
cause
for
the
heroin
found
in
the
basement?
and
the
michigan
supreme
court--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--right.
and
the
michigan
supreme
counrt
didn't
reach
that
question
because
of
their
decision
on
the
threshold
question
of
the
initial
detention,
which
they
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
the
dissenters
did
and
would
have
found
probable
cause:
we're
confident
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
right.
the
dissenters
pointed
to
law
from
this
court
and
from
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
the
past,
which
holds
that
an
officer
is...
probable
cause
exists
when
a
lay
person,
a
person
of
reasonable
caution
and
prudence
would
believe
that
a
crime
was
being
committed,
not
whether
the
officers
have
sufficient
evidence
to
convict.
we
believe
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
erred
in
that
and
that
if
the
michigan
supreme
court
reaches
the
question,
we're
confident
they'll,
they'll
also
reach
that
position.
but
they
didn't
reach
it.
and
they
didn't
reach
it
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
dunaway
v.
new
york.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
the
search
began
at
10:10
p.m.,
approximately,
the
officers
testified.
and
the
return
to
the
search
warrant,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
is
signed
both
by
mr.
summers...
pardon?
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it's
signed
at
11
o'clock.
so,
at
the
outside,
the
search
took
50
minutes.
and
i
would
be
assuming
that
respondent...
i
would
assume
that
respondent
was
arrested
sometime
prior
to
that,
after
the
heroin
was
discovered
in
the
basement.
at
the
outside,
it's
50
minutes.
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
just
like
to
take
a
moment
to
again
emphasize
the
distinction
in
our
ground
on
the
detention
issue.
we
see
this,
as
i
said,
as
a
warrants
case.
we
believe
that
respondent,
that
persons
on
the
premises
or
departing
from
the
premises
where
a
warrant
is
going
to
be
executed
may
be
detained
while
the
warrant
is
executed
regardless
of
any
individualized,
particularized,
terry-type
suspicion
that
that
person
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
there
may
have
been
such
a
suspicion
as
to
mr.
summers.
there
probably
was
not
such
a
suspicion
as
to
the
other
six
people
in
the
house
other
than
mr.
calhoun.
we
submit
that
they
could
all
be
detained
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
there's...
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
george
summers
is
the
george
or
whether
someone
else
is
the
george.
the
record
does
not
state
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
it
depends
on
whether
george
summers
is
the
george
and
we
don't
know
that.
we
just...
i
can't
say
whether
he
is--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no.
of
course,
it's
our
position
that
it
authorized
the
search
of...
of
anyone,
but
not...
didn't
specifically
name
anybody.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
it
is
an
error
to
view
the
permissible
scope
of
fourth
amendment
detentions
as
only
existing
in
a
criminal
context
somewhere
between
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause.
reasonable
detentions
may
occur
without
any
particularized
suspicion
as
to
any
individual,
as
this
court
has
held
in
border
cases.
for
example,
in
material
witness
cases.
people
can
be
held
against
their
wills
to
be
witnesses
in
cases.
those
detentions
are
without
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion,
or
anything
that
those
persons
are
involved
in
criminal
activity,
but
they're
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
believe
they
do
fall
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
of
the
governmental
interest
involved.
we
are
submitting
that
there
is
a
class
of
detentions
here
of
persons
on
or
departing
from
the
premises
that
is
reasonable,
to
insure
the
full
and
faithful
execution
of
the
warrant,
without
