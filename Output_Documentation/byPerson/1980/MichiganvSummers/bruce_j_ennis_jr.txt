mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
greatly
appreciate
the
court's
permission
to
argue
as
amicus
in
this
complex
and
important
case.
i
will
not
address
the
merits.
rather,
i
will
argue
that
there
are
both
jurisdictional
and
policy
grounds
why
the
court
should
not
resolve
the
merits
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
should
instead
either
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
or
remand
for
clarification.
briefly,
as
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
ruled,
there
are
adequate
and
independent
state
law
grounds
that
would
support
the
same
judgment
and
would
require
exclusion
of
the
evidence
regardless
of
this
court's
rulings
on
any
of
the
federal
questions
presented
by
petitioner.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
did
rest
on
a
federal
ground.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
and
on
no
state
ground.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
principle
that
emerges
from
all
of
this
court's
cases
on
adequate
and
independent
state
law
grounds
is
that
this
court
will
not
review
a
state
court
judgement
unless
the
decision
on
the
federal
ground
was
necessary
to
that
judgment
and
in
this
case,
given
the
rulings
of
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
which
both
reached
the
same
judgment
on
state
law
grounds,
it
cannot
be
said
that
it
was
necessary.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
highest
court
in
the
state
has
not
reached
either
of
the
state
law
grounds
that
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
relied
upon.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
infer
from
that
fact
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
can't
second
guess
the
thinking
behind
the
michigan
supreme
court's
majority
opinion.
i
can
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
michigan
is
a
single
court
of
appeals
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
state.
that
court
has
ruled
on
state
law
grounds
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
must
be
excluded.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me
be
candid,
your
honor.
the
case
hinges
on
a
michigan
case
called
people
v.
davenport
and
it
is
true
that
the
minority
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
had
misinterpreted
that
people
v.
davenport
case,
but
the
majority
did
not
go
along
with
that
view.
they
expressed
no
view
whatsoever
on
the
point.
it
can
be
said,
however,
that
in
the
majority
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
mr.
justice
levin,
who,
while
he
was
on
the
court
of
appeals,
was
the
author
of
the
people
v.
davenport
opinion.
at
the
very
least,
at
the
very
least,
if
there
is
some
ambiguity
about
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
would
rule
on
these
state
law
grounds,
it
certainly
cannot
be
said
by
this
court
that
michigan
law
would
authorize
the
detention
and
search
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
given
what
mr.
justice
jackson
said
for
the
court
in
herb
v.
pitcairn,
that
the
court
from
the
time
of
its
foundation
has
adhered
to
the
principle
that
it
will
not
review
judgements
of
state
courts
that
rest
on
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
if
the
same
judgement
would
be
rendered
by
the
state
courts
after
we
corrected
its
views
of
federal
laws--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
this
court
cannot
force
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
decide
the
case
on
state
law
grounds.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
what
could
happen
in
that
circumstance
is
it
could
go
back
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
they
could
decide
to
decide
the
case
on
the
state
law
grounds
for
which
they
originally
granted
leave
to
appeal.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i
suggested,
your
honor,
that
an
alternative
method
of
proceeding
would
be
as
this
court
did
in
krivda,
to
vacate
and
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
for
clarification.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
not,
because
i'm
not
arguing
for
the
purely
speculative
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
state
law
ground.
this
case
is
unique
from
all
the
previous
cases
i
am
aware
of
in
this
court
on
adequate
state
law
ground
issues
in
that
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
expressly
rule
on
state
law
grounds,
so
it
is
not
speculative
to
suggest
that
there
might
be
a
state
law
ground.
in
fact,
there
has
been
a
ruling
that
there
is.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
which
judgments,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
they
are
not
directly
before
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it
is
certainly
true.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
even
if
there
would
be
no
jurisdictional
bar
to
this
court
entertaining
the
case,
as
i
think
there
is,
there
is
a
very
strong
policy
reason
under
ashwander
for
this
court
not
to
grant
cert
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
because
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
resolve
these
very
difficult
and
important
federal
constitutional
questions
in
order
for
the
same
judgment
to
stand
on
state
law
grounds.
in
those
circumstances
i
think
it
is
at
least
appropriate
to
vacate
and
remand
to
the
state
court
for
clarification.
in
that
connection,
let
me
point
out
something
that
is
not
mentioned
in
my
amicus
brief,
and
that
is
that
michigan
has
since
1919
adopted
its
own
state
exclusionary
rule,
immediately
after
weeks,
and
in
people
v.
beavers...
decided
393
michigan
554...
the
michigan
supreme
court
ruled
that
they
will
apply
their
state
exclusionary
rule
even
in
circumstances
where
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
do
not
require
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
slightly
different
in
that
the
question
there
is
whether
the
state
court
acted
under
what
it
believed
to
be
the
compulsion
of
overriding
federal
law.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
in
fact,
the
case
law
in
michigan,
if
you
will
look
into
it,
indicates
that
the
michigan
courts
apply
under
their
own
fourth
amendment
principles,
give
more
protection
to
defendants
than
would
probably
be
required
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
they
also
apply
a
state
exclusionary
rule
that
excludes
evidence
that
would
not
have
to
be
excluded
under
the
federal
exclusionary
rule.
they
are
not
acting
under
compulsion
of
federal
law
by
being
more
protective
of
individual
rights.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
and
that's
why
i
think,
given
the
two
lower
court
decisions
so
that
it's
not
just
speculative
possibility
that
it
could
be
done,
it
would
certainly
be
consistent
with
ashwander
for
this
court
to
vacate
and
remand
for
clarification.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
it
does
not
go
that
far,
your
honor.
let
me
suggest
some
limiting
principles.
first,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
should
vacate
and
remand
whenever
there
is
simply
a
speculative
possibility
that
a
state
law
ground
might
be
adequate
and
independent.
i
am
only
suggesting
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
ruled
that
there
is
such
state
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
never
before
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
i
believe
this
case
is
unique,
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
determine.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
it
may
be
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
decided
simply
to
discuss
these
questions
in
chronological
order,
and
the
first
issue
that
comes
up
is
the
legality
of
the
detention.
it
may
be
that
was
the
sole
basis
of
why
they
addressed
the
detention
issue
rather
than
the
subsequent
state
law
issues
that
were
found
dispositive
in
the
lower
courts.
i
think
in
those
circumstances
a
remand
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question
can
probably
be
resolved
under
existing
law,
under
terry
v.
ohio.
obviously,
as
you
are
aware,
your
honor,
terry
does
permit
a
pat
down
for
weapons
in
circumstances
where
the
police
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
a
person
might
be
armed
and
dangerous,
even
if
they
do
not
have
probable
cause
to
detain
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time
or
to
arrest.
the
interesting
point
here
is
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
even
consider
whether
terry,
existing
law,
would
have
authorized
that
kind
of
a
search
involved
in
this
case,
because
it
went
off
on
the
quite
different
ground,
under
dunaway,
that
there
could
be
no
detention
whatsoever.
that,
i
think,
is
an
additional
reason
why
cert
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
if
the
court
decides
to
reach
that
question,
since
that
particular
question,
the
scope
of
terry
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
has
never
been
considered
by
the
michigan
supreme
court.
again,
i
do
appreciate
the
permission
to
argue
as
amicus.
thank
you
very
much.
