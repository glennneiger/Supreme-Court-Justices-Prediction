mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
like
many
other
tax
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
in
recent
terms,
this
case
is
governed
by
longstanding
treasury
regulations
that
explicitly
support
the
internal
revenue
service's
position.
the
regulations
in
question
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
the
appendix,
page
7a.
they
say,
in
defining
wages
for
both
fica
and
futa
purposes...
the
regulations
on
this
score
are
identical...
"ordinarily,
facilities
or
privileges
such
as
entertainment,
medical
services,
or
so
called
courtesy
discounts,
furnished
or
offered
by
an
employer
to
his
employees
generally
are
not
considered
as
remuneration
for
employment
if
such
facilities
or
privileges
are
of
relatively
small
value
and
are
offered
or
furnished
by
the
employer
merely
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
health,
good
will,
contentment,
or
efficiency
of
his
employees.
"
but
then,
in
language
that
we
consider
crucial,
the
regulation
goes
on
to
say,
"the
term
"facilities
or
privileges",
however,
does
not
ordinarily
include
the
value
of
meals
or
lodging
furnished,
for
example,
to
restaurant
or
hotel
employees,
or
to
seamen
or
other
employees
aboard
vessels,
since
generally
these
items
constitute
an
appreciable
part
of
the
total
remuneration
of
such
employees.
"
we
consider
that
the
language
of
this
regulation,
which
has
been
extant
since
1940,
some
41
years,
control
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
a
fica
and
a
futa
regulation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
applicable
to
both,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
to
both
taxes
under
fica;
exactly.
these
regulations
are,
of
course,
consistent
with
the
statutory
definition
of
wages
as
all
remuneration
for
employment,
including
the
cash
value
of
all
remuneration
paid
in
any
other
medium
than
cash.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
these
regulations...
to
trace
the
history
in
some
detail,
the
regulations
first
came
out
in
1936,
right
after
social
security
was
enacted.
from
1936
to
1940,
the
futa
regulations
for
some
peculiar
reason
incorporated
the
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine
that
petitioner
relies
upon
in
this
case.
in
1940,
the
fica
regulations,
and
indeed
the
analog
of
the
social
security
regulations,
never
included
the
convenience
of
the
employer
doctrine.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
contemporaneous
construction,
that
was
short
lived
in
the
sense
that
it
was
only
for
four
years.
and
the
initial
regulation
was
at
variance
on
futa.
the
point
that
we
stress
is
that
in
1940
that
was
corrected
and
since
1940,
for
the
last
41
years,
the
regulations
have
consistently
required
that
meals
and
lodging
be
included
in
the
tax
base.
those
regulations,
we
submit,
are
consistent
with
the
committee
reports
which
accompanied
the
enactment
of
the
social
security
legislation,
indicating
that
wages
were
to
include
compensation
paid
in
any
form,
such
as
room
and
board.
and
viewed
against
the
background
of
the
way...
when
social
security
was
enacted
in
the
mid-1930s,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
suggest
that
many
people
worked
for
little
more
than
room
and
board,
and
congress
was
terribly
concerned
that
those
people
be
covered
and
that
they
get
benefits
consistent
with
those
wages.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
without
meals
or
lodging.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
any
event--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--he
doesn't,
and
i
find
that
quite
peculiar,
because--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
if
i
may
explain
his
argument...
but
i
would
like
to
do
so
by
first--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--he
disagrees
with
me,
but
we
would
submit
that
he
is
wrong.
the
regulations--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--exactly.
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
true.
his
only
point--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--exactly.
may
i
simply
suggest,
on
that
four
year
period
from
1936
to
1940,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
a
similar
problem
a
few
terms
ago
in
the
national
muffler
dealers
association
case.
indeed,
where
the
regulations
were
amended
after
about
eight
or
nine
years
from
the...
i
think
from
1919
to
1927,
the
regulations
were
at
variance
with
the
way
they
were
finally
recast.
but
our
point
simply
is
that
the
regulations
now
that
have
been
extant
for
41
years
have
been
extant
during
a
period
in
which
congress
recodified
the
tax
law
in
1954
and
there
were
a
number
of
appellate
decisions
that
upheld
the
inclusion
of
meals
and
lodgings.
and
to
point
simply
that
the
result
would
be
otherwise
with
respect
to
income
tax
purposes,
for
income
tax
purposes,
or
income
tax
withholding
purposes,
is
really
beside
the
point.
i
mean,
nobody's
quarreling
here
that
these
meals
and
lodging
were
excludable
under
119
and
i
think,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
reason
they're
excluded
from
income
tax
withholding
is
simply
they're
not
subject
to
income
tax,
so
why
should
they
be
subject
to
income
tax
withholding?
the
court
of
appeals
here,
below,
said
the
same
thing.
a
rationale
is
not
difficult
to
surmise,
because
income
tax
withholding
is
to
set
aside
amounts
to
pay
the
recipient's
income
taxes.
there
isn't
any
income
tax
due
on
this
by
operation
of
statute,
section
119,
which
the
court
dealt
with
a
few
terms
ago
in
the
kowalski
case.
now--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--three.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
let's
see,
the
9th
circuit
and
the
6th
circuit
and
the
4th
circuit
support
our
position
in
addition
to
the
5th
circuit.
the
court
of
claims
has
rejected
our
position,
and
the
7th
circuit
in
the
oscar
mayer
case
has
rejected
our
position.
and
this
leads
me
to
what
i
think
is
really
the
nub
of
the
problem
here.
the
nub
of
the
problem
here
is
that
the
court
of
claims
in
hotel
conquistador
and
the
7th
circuit
in
oscar
mayer
believe
that
the
climate
somehow
changed
in
this
area
after
this
court
decided
the
central
illinois
public
service
company
case.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
here
correctly
found
that
that
question
in
that
case
does
not
bear
on
this
case.
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
issue
before
the
court
there
was
reimbursements
for
noon
meals.
and
we
argued
that
those
reimbursements
were
subject
to
income
tax
withholding.
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
stressed
heavily
the
fact
that
the
employer
in
that
case
in
1963
could
not
reasonably
have
been
held
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
required
to
withhold
on
such
meal
reimbursements.
and
because
of
that
so
called
unfair
notice
or
lack
of
notice,
the
court
was
unwilling
to
impose
secondary
tax
liability
on
the
employer
in
that
case.
if
i
may
just
read
a
few
excerpts
from
the
court's
opinion,
where
the
court
says
at
page
32,
"in
1963
not
one
regulation
or
ruling
required
withholding
on
any
travel
expense
reimbursement.
"
"the
intimation
was
quite
the
other
way.
"
"no
employer
in
viewing
the
regulations
in
1963
could
reasonably
suspect
that
a
withholding
obligation
existed.
"
"the
first
published
pronouncement
by
the
internal
revenue
service
with
respect
to
withholding
came
only
in
1969.
"
many
years
after...
well,
six
years
after
the
tax
year
in
that
case.
those
considerations
don't
bear
here.
there
can
be
no
question
that
since
1940
employers
were
on
notice,
employers
like
rowan
company,
that
they
were
required
to
include
meals
and
lodging
in
fica
and
futa,
whatever
the
income
tax
or
the
income
tax
withholding
situation
might
have
been.
indeed,
the
service
in
the
1940s
was
publishing
rulings
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
the
result
would
be
different
under
income
tax
withholding.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
we
don't
take
that
position
because
we
all
benefit
from
the
court's
statement
in
that
respect.
here
congress--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
no.
i
think
our
position
is
strongly
buttressed
by
these
regulations
which
have
survived
reenactment
and,
as
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
instances,
that
treasury
regulations
in
that
kind
of
context,
which
survive
reenactments
of
the
statute,
which
are
extant
during
a
probative
appellate
decisions
which
can
reasonably
be
believed
to
have
come
to
the
attention
of
congress,
that
those
kinds
of
regulations
have
the
effect
of
law.
the
court
has
said
that
in
the
cammarano
case
and
in
the
correll
case.
and
we
think
that
the
differences,
the
qualitative
differences
between
the
kind
of
case
that
we
brought
to
the
court
in
central
illinois
and
this
case
are
very
marked.
in
central
illinois,
i
argued
to
this
court
that
the
correll
rule
had
to
be
imported
into
the
withholding
tax
regulations,
and
the
court
rejected
that,
because
the
correll
rule
came
many
years
after
the
regulations,
and
in
fact
the
regulations
that
the
court
cited
in
the
central
illinois
case
could
reasonably
have
been
read
to
support
the
taxpayer's
position
in
that
case.
here
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
regulations
fit
this
case
like
a
glove.
these
are
meals
and
lodging
afforded
to
seamen
and
people
who
work
on
vessels,
they
constitute
an
appreciable
part
of
their
remuneration--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
i'm
saying
that
wages
for
purposes
of
fica
and
futa,
under
the
social
security
statute--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--is
a
different
kind
of
concept.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
congress
wanted
it
to
be
larger,
and
we
think
that,
unlike
our
case
in
central
illinois,
congress
explicitly
indicated
that
it
wanted
it
to
be
larger.
the
treasury
has
specifically
indicated
that
it
wanted
it
to
be
larger
by
regulations
that
explicitly
govern
the
case,
and
it
wasn't--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
yes,
in
a
sense.
for
example,
the
regulations
under
withholding
point
to
the
fact
that,
you
know,
they
have
a
cross
reference
to
section
119.
it
says
meals
and
lodging
that
is
excludable
for
income
tax
purposes
are
excludable
for
wages
for
purposes
of
the
income
tax
withholding.
see
section
1.119-1.
and
the
point
simply
is,
there's
no
point
in
withholding
income
taxes
from
amounts
that
are
not
subject
to
income
tax.
this
is...
the
social
security
system,
we
submit,
is
a
completely
different
system.
it's
a
completely
different
statutory
system
designed
to
afford
benefits.
the
court
has
said
that
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
social
security
tax
cases.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
there's
no
vested
right
in
the
benefit
but
we
think
that
given
the
court's
careful
construction
of
its
opinion
in
central
illinois
indicating
that
the
government's
view
was
not
to
prevail
because
of
the
lack
of
notice
to
the
affected
industry,
simply
doesn't
apply
here
where
the
notice
could
not
have
been
more
explicitly
stated.
there
can
be
no
question
here
that
these
meals
and
lodging
constitute
17
percent
of
these
employees'
cash
wages.
that
is
an
appreciable
part
of
their
wages.
it's
on
a
daily
basis.
nobody
can
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
the
regulation
fits
this
case.
and
while
the
taxpayer
here
attempts
to
argue
to
the
contrary,
the
argument
really
is
an
assault
on
these
regulations,
and
for
the
taxpayer
to
prevail,
i
would
suggest
the
regulations
would
have
to
be
declared
invalid.
i
see
no
basis
for
declaring
them
invalid,
given
the
fact
that
they
have
been
outstanding
for
such
a
long
time
and
have
been...
where
the
affected
industries
that
supply
meals
and
lodging
to
their
employees
have
long
been
on
notice
of
the
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
that's
so.
but
given
the
committee
reports'
plainly
stated
intention
to
include
room
and
board
in
taxable
wages
in
1935,
i
don't
see
how
they
could
be
outside
the
congressional...
congress
indicated
that
it
wanted
to
include
this
kind
of
compensation
in
taxable
wages
for
social
security,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
at
that
time
the
convenience
of
the
employer
test
for
income
tax
purposes
had
been
around
for
quite
some
time.
it
just
doesn't
apply
here,
and
the
service
has
indicated
that
it
doesn't
apply,
it
has
indicated
for
the
last
45
years
that
it
doesn't
apply
here.
that's
why
central
illinois,
we
suggest,
has
no
bearing
on
this
case,
and
indeed,
one
of
the
other
aspects
of
central
illinois
was
the
fact
that
the
court
intimated
that
it
was...
that
they
thought
that
perhaps
the
cash
payments
in
kowalski...
that
the
cash
payments,
or
the
income
tax
aspects
of
the
cash
payments,
weren't
really
clear
until
this
court's
opinion
in
kowalski.
assuming
that
that
was
the
case,
that
consideration
has
no
application
here
where
everyone
has
long
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
meals
and
lodging
furnished
to
seamen
aboard
vessels...
nothing
could
be
more
applicable,
i
submit.
and
given
the
court's
many
quoted
statements
about
the
deference
to
be
given
treasury
regulations,
here
the
treasury
has
issued
a
regulation
that
carefully
and
explicitly
is
addressed
to
this
very
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
suggest
that
the
fact
that
they
could
be
but
weren't
really
is
not
a
qualitative
difference
in
terms
of
seamen.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
here
the
affected
employees
were
60
miles
out
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
as
a
practicable
matter,
if
they
were
going
to
do
their
work
in
an
efficient
way,
i
would
suggest
that
they
really
couldn't
have--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
think--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
case
as
it
comes
to
the
court,
and
here
i
would
suggest
that
the
rule
has
been
settled
in
this
area.
and
indeed,
until
the
court
of
claims
broke
stride
in
hotel
conquistador
and
the
7th
circuit
in
oscar
mayer,
it
had
been
settled
among
the
lower
courts
that
the
rule
was
in
our
favor.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
may
well
be
the
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
isn't
that
really
a
question
of
tax
policy
for
the
treasury
rather
than
for
the
department
of
justice?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
assume
that
social
security
funds
go
into
special--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--those
funds
would
be
increased
if
we
win.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
they
also
go
in
to
fund
these
pensions.
i
mean
that's
the
point--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
would
hope
not.
i
mean...
i
hope
it
earns
income.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
covered
by
section
3121(a)(7)(a),
which
excludes
meals
and
lodging,
these
non
cash
benefits
from
wages
for
domestic
workers,
for
both
and
fica
and
futa--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--right,
and
perforce
for
income
tax
purposes
under
section
119.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
any
event,
to
summarize
simply,
we
don't
really
think
that
central
illinois
has
altered
what
we
think
was
the
settled
rule
before
it
with
respect
to
social
security
and
futa
and
we
don't
think
it
has
any
bearing
on
this
case.
what
is
germane
are
these
long
standing
treasury
regulations
which
we
believe,
having
survived
reenactment,
having
survived
a
probative
appellate
decisions,
and
having
been
issued
against
the
background
of
a
long
standing
and
consistent
body
of
revenue
rulings
that
have
put
the
affected
