they
are
not
subject
to--
justice
jr.
--the
employees
don't
have
to
include
these
for
income
tax
purposes?
justice
jr.
but
the
reason...
is
that
the
reason
for
that,
since
they're
not
subject
to
tax?
why
wouldn't
you
withhold?
justice
jr.
my
question
was--
justice
jr.
--no,
but
isn't
it
logical,
if
they're
not
to
be
included
as
income
for
tax
purposes,
you
wouldn't
include
them
for
withholding
purposes,
would
you?
