mr.
smith,
following
up
on
justice
rehnquist's
question,
there
you
said
that
the
two
concepts
were
the
same
and
we
said,
no,
the
concept
of
income
is
the
larger
concept
and
wages
are
smaller.
here
you're
saying
wages
is
a
larger
concept
than
income.
justice
stevens
it's
a
larger
concept
than
income
for
income
tax
purposes.
justice
stevens
but
then
larger.
justice
stevens
if
congress
had
said
explicitly,
wages
shall
include
matters
that
are
not
income?
