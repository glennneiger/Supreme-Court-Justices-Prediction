justice
stewart
in
that
case,
perhaps
the
members
of
the
court
are...
perhaps
you
don't
have
a
court
here,
because
i'd
venture
to
guess
that
most
if
not
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
have
such
household
employees,
at
least
part
time.
justice
stewart
by
statute.
justice
stewart
you
say
there
are
four,
and
that's
repeated
in
the
briefs,
and
i'm
sure
there
are,
but
i
count
only
three,
the
income
taxes
and
fica
and
futa.
justice
stewart
i
see.
justice
stewart
since
there
are
two
ficas--
justice
stewart
and
to
both
taxes
under
fica?
justice
stewart
well,
i
would
almost
hope
it
were.
mr.
smith,
we
asked
mr.
worthy
about
the
meals
furnished
to
household
employees
and
his
response
was
that
they're
covered
by
a
specific
statute.
justice
stewart
for
both,
for
tax
purposes.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
revenue
ruling.
justice
stewart
right.
i
thought
that
gcms
were
still
going
in
1957.
i
understand.
