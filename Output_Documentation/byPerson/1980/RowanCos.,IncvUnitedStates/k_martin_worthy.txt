mr.
k.
martin
worthy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
meals
and
lodging
furnished
without
charge
to
employees
solely
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
are
wages
subject
to
social
security,
that
is,
fica
and
futa
taxes.
the
court
below
said
yes.
we
think
that
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
central
illinois
public
service
company
in
1978,
emphasizing
that
wages
is
a
narrowly
defined
term,
much
narrower
than
income,
the
legislative
history
of
social
security
and
income
tax
withholding
indicating
that
congress
intended
that
the
same
wage
base,
the
same
exact
tax
base
of
wages
with
the
same
definition,
be
used
for
all
employment
tax
purposes,
and
the
60-year
history
of
rulings,
regulations,
and
cases
that
meals
and
lodging
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
are
not
income,
the
answer
is
clearly
that
they
are
not
subject
to
tax.
the
essential
facts
are
undisputed.
the
petitioner
operates
oil
and
gas
drilling
rigs
up
to
60
miles
offshore,
with
crews
of
up
to
a
dozen
people.
because
it's
too
costly
for
the
crews
to
leave
at
the
end
of
each
shift--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--the
crews
to
leave
the--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--the
employer.
the
record
shows
that
the
expense
of
transporting
the
men
back
and
forth
from
the
shore
to
the
rig
is
borne
by
the
employer
and
borne
during
the
employer's
time.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
on
company
time.
they
are
paid
while
they
are
being
transported.
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
yes,
sir.
the
figure
is--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--$275
to
$350
per
crew
per
trip,
which
breaks
down
to
about
$25
to
$29
per
man,
with
a
12-man
crew
as
compared
to
about
$6
a
day
for
furnishing
food
and
lodging
aboard
the
rig.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
yes,
sir,
about
five
times
as
much
as
the
food
and
lodging.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
unless
they
are
awfully
hungry,
but
i
believe
it's
been
stipulated
that
the
value
of
the
food
and
lodging
is
$6
per
man
per
day,
as
compared
to
the
$29
cost
per
man
per
day
to
transport
them
back
and
forth
to
shore.
and
as
a
result,
therefore,
they
were
kept
aboard
for
12-hour
shifts
for
ten
days
and
then
every
five
days
a
crew
went
ashore
and
for
five
days
off
when
a
new
crew
came
aboard.
and
so
lodging
was
furnished
aboard
with
three
meals
a
day,
cafeteria
style,
at
petitioner's
expense,
to
each
crew
member
during
the
time
he
remained
aboard.
now,
when
he
was
aboard,
off
duty,
a
member
of
a
crew
was
not
expected
to
perform
any
services.
there
was
no
agreement
to
furnish
the
food
or
lodging,
and
there
was
no
cash
allowance
if
meals
or
lodging
were
refused,
and
the
petitioner
had
no
obligation
to
transport
the
crew
members
back
ashore
at
the
end
of
each
shift,
the
only
obligation
being
at
the
end
of
the
10-day
shift.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
i
don't
think
it's
any
difference
in
principle,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
however,
i
should
say
in
candor--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--i
should
say,
in
all
candor,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
by
statute
the
meals
and
lodging
furnished
to
household
employees
are
exempt.
i
don't
think
the
principle
is
any
different,
but
the
exemption
is
provided
by
statute
in
the
case
of
domestic
employees.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
i
think
i
should
be
perfectly
fair
about
that.
now,
no
meals
or
lodging
were
provided
to
the
crew
members
during
their
off
duty
days
and
they
had
to
obtain
meals
and
lodging,
and
maintain
regular
lodging
ashore
for
their
use
during
the
five
days
they
were
off
duty
at
their
own
expense.
and
the
court
should
know
that
in
addition
to
the
offshore
rigs,
the
petitioner
also
operated
land
based
rigs.
land-based
crews
were
paid
substantially
the
same
cash
wages
as
the
offshore
crews
but
the
land
based
crews
went
home
every
night
and
they
were
not
furnished
any
meals
or
lodging
at
the
petitioner's
expense.
now,
the
government
admits
that
the
meals
and
lodging
were
provided
as
a
result
of
a
unilateral
decision
by
petitioner
based
on
its
own
economic
reasons
and
that
since
they
were
furnished
for
the
convenience
of
the
taxpayer
as
an
employer,
they
are
not
wages
subject
to
income
tax
withholding.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
they
are
not
subject
to;
they
are
not
wages
subject
to
income
tax.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
that's
correct,
sir,
but
not
only
that,
but
more
significantly
they
are
not
within
the
definition
of
wages
for
income
tax
withholding
purposes,
the
income
tax
withholding
being
one
of
the
four
employment
taxes
imposed.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
no,
sir.
it's
been
established
since
at
least
1919
in
all
the
rulings
and
regulations
and
cases
which
were
reviewed
very
thoroughly
by
this
court
in
the
kowalski
case
just
four
years
ago,
that
meals
and
lodging
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
have
consistently
been
held
not
to
be
income,
even
though
the
statute
defined
income
to
include
wages.
and
that's
been
the
rule
established--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--for
the
last
62
years.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
certainly
that's
logical,
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
i
should
point
out
that
in
the
central
illinois
case,
just
two
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
meal
reimbursements
were
subject
to
income
tax.
however,
they
were
not
subject
to
withholding
tax,
simply
because
they
were
not
wages,
and
income
tax
withholding
is
imposed
on
wages,
which
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
is
a
much
narrower
term
than
income.
now,
aside
from
income
tax
withholding,
the
other
three
employment
taxes
are
an
employee
income
tax
under
the
social
security
act
or
fica,
which
is
also
subject
to
withholding;
an
excise
tax
on
employers
under
the
social
security
act
or
fica,
in
the
identical
amount;
and
federal
unemployment
insurance
tax
on
employers
or
futa.
now,
all
four
of
these
taxes,
the
income
tax
withholding
and
the
three
social
security
taxes,
are
imposed
on
wages.
and
as
acknowledged
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
government,
wages
are
defined
for
all
four
employment
tax
purposes
in
essentially
identical
terms,
as
all
remuneration
for
services
or
employment.
and
as
i've
suggested,
for
over
60...
yes,
sir?
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
well,
fica
consists
of
two
taxes.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
there's
one
tax
which
is
by
statute
an
income
tax,
which
is
highly
significant;
it's
a
tax
on
income
limited
to
the
wages
of
employees,
which
is
withheld
by
the
employer;
and
a
tax
in
an
additional
amount...
the
first
tax
is
borne
by
the
employee
through
the
withholding
system.
the
second
fica
tax
is
on
the
employer,
borne
by
the
employer
and
paid
by
the
employer.
it
has
the
identical
tax
base
in
the
identical
amount.
and
the
third
social
security
tax
is
futa,
which
is
borne
entirely
by
the
employer.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
there
are
two
ficas.
it
is
a
bit
confusing,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--yes,
sir,
it
is
common,
and
the
service
has
ruled
that
the
employer
can
do
so
without
that
additional
tax
being
counted
as
wages
as
a
part
of
the
tax
base.
now,
as
i
previously
indicated,
for
62
years
meals
and
lodging
furnished
employees
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
have
been
recognized
as
not
being
remuneration
for
services,
and
therefore
not
income
for
income
tax
purposes,
even
though
the
revenue
acts
from
1918
on
repeatedly
defined
income
as
including
wages
of
whatever
kind
and
in
whatever
form
paid.
thus,
although
the
government
in
its
briefs
only
talks
about
codification
of
the
convenience
of
the
employer
rule
in
1954,
in
section
119,
it
was
well
understood
that
wages
did
not
include
meals
and
lodging
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
when
the
social
security
taxes
were
enacted
in
1935.
and
the
reason,
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
reviewing
the
cases
and
rulings
in
kowalski
four
years
ago,
is
that
such
items
simply
are
not
compensation
for
services
and
hence
not
income.
income
tax
withholding
came
in
in
1942,
requiring
employers
to
withhold
income
tax
on
wages
paid
their
employees.
the
service
almost
immediately
issued
regulation
115
which,
if
i
may
quote,
"provides
that
if
living
quarters
or
meals
are
furnished
to
an
employee
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
the
value
thereof
need
not
be
included
as
wages
subject
to
withholding.
"
now,
this
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
income
tax
withholding
statute
is
highly
significant
because
this
was
long
before
codification
of
the
convenience
rule
in
section
119
and
it's
significant
because
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
income
tax
withholding,
in
which
congress
expressed
a
clear
and
specific
intent
to
adopt
as
a
definitional
base
for
income
tax
withholding
exactly
the
identical
base
previously
adopted
for
social
security
taxes.
then
still
later,
in
1978,
when
section
119
was
amended
by
congress
to
make
the
exclusion
apply
to
meals
furnished
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer,
although
the
employer
imposes
a
partial
charge,
senator
long,
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
and
manager
of
the
bill
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
stated
on
the
senate
floor
that
it
was
expected
that
"an
item
excluded
from
gross
income
under
the
convenience
of
employer
test
will
also
be
excluded
from
the
definition
of
wages
for
all
payroll
tax
purposes,
specifically
including
income
tax
withholding,
social
security
or
fica,
and
futa
tax.
"
in
central
illinois,
this
court
found
that
even
though
lunch
payments
received
by
employees
were
subject
to
income
tax
in
their
hands,
they
simply
were
not
wages
subject
to
income
tax
withholding.
the
government
had
contended
there,
as
it
contends
here,
that
since
the
payments
at
issue
were
part
of
the
employment
relationship
and
a
part
of
the
total
of
the
personal
benefits
that
arose
out
of
that
relationship,
they
necessarily
constituted
wages.
this
court,
however,
rejected
what
it
described
as
"such
an
expansive
and
sweeping
definition
of
wages.
"
finding
such
contention
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
of
setting
forth
a
standard
that
is
wages,
which
the
court
described
as
being
intentionally
narrow
and
precise.
the
court
emphasized
that
the
base
is
limited
to
wages
and
that
such
term
is
limited
by
statute
in
the
case
of
income
tax
withholding
to
mean
"all
remuneration
for
services
performed
by
an
employee
for
his
employer.
"
essentially,
the
identical
words
of
the
fica
and
futa
tax
statutes.
the
court
also
emphasized
that
the
term
"wages"
makes
the
tax
base
much
narrower
than
subjectability
to
income
taxation.
now,
it's
true
the
government
has
cited
some
authority
for
contrary
conclusion.
although
the
9th
circuit
in
pacific
american
fisheries
in
1943,
long
before
central
illinois
was
decided
by
this
case,
suggested...
and
it's
only
a
suggestion...
that
the
convenience
of
the
employer
test
might
be
inapplicable
for
social
security
tax
purposes,
and
such
suggestion
was
later
cited
by
approval
by
a
district
court
in
the
kresge
cases
and
by
another
district
court
in
the
goldsboro
case.
such
statements
are
all
dicta
in
those
cases
because
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases,
pacific
american
fisheries,
kresge,
and
goldsboro,
it
was
found
that
the
meals
or
lodging
involved
were
not
furnished
as
a
convenience
to
the
employer,
as
has
been
conceded
here.
now,
the
government
has
not
been
wholly
consistent
in
its
position
on
this
question.
immediately
after
the
social
security
tax
was
enacted
in
1935,
the
service
in
1936
issued
regulation
90,
specifically
adopting
the
convenience
of
the
employer
test
for
futa
tax
purposes.
and
in
1937
the
service
repeated
that
position
in
social
security
tax
ruling
110
and
interestingly
enough,
citing
there
as
authority
for
its
position
that
meals
and
lodging
for
the
convenience
of
the
employer
were
not
subject
to
social
security
tax,
its
previous
income
tax
ruling
in
1920
to
the
same
effect.
now
the
government
makes
essentially
four
arguments.
it
points
out
that
it
revised
its
regulations
in
1940
to
exclude
mention
of
the
convenience
of
employer
test.
and
it
claims
that
such
regulations
were
issued
pursuant
to
specific
grant
of
statutory
authority
to
the
social
security
board
and
the
treasury,
and
notes
that
such
regulations,
it
says,
have
been
in
effect
for
40
years
and
that
the
underlying
purpose
of
social
security
justifies
a
different
result
for
income
tax
and
social
security
tax
purposes.
but
we
submit
that
the
government
is
simply
wrong.
there
is
no
specific
statutory
authority.
the
only
authority
to
issue
a
regulation
cited
by
the
government
is
in
internal
revenue
code
section
7805(a)
authorizing
the
issuance
of
interpretive
and
procedural
regulations
for
the
entire
internal
revenue
code.
and
as
professor
davis
has
pointed
out
in
his
treatise
on
administrative
law
at
section
503,
nearly
all
treasury
regulations
are
interpretative
and
not
legislative
regulations.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
blackmun?
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
this
court
in
1945,
in
overturning
an
administrative
determination
as
to
whether
certain
payments
were
wages
for
social
security
purposes,
under
the
very
identical
language
and
under
the
very
identical
act
as
is
involved
here,
said,
"congress
might
have
delegated
to
the
social
security
board
to
determine
what
compensation
paid
should
be
treated
as
wages.
"
"congress
did
neither.
"
congress
used
a
well
understood
word,
the
court
said,
wages,
to
indicate
the
receipts
which
were
to
govern
taxes
and
benefits
under
the
social
security
act.
now,
in
the
royster
case,
the
government
told
the
4th
circuit
on
brief
in
1972
that
"we
agree
with
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
term
"wages"
has
the
same
meaning
for
all
of
the
employment
taxes
involved.
"
the
government
told
the
court
of
claims
the
same
thing
in
the
conquistador
case
in
1978,
when
they
expected
this
court
to
affirm
rather
than
reverse
central
illinois.
and
the
4th
circuit
in
the
royster
case
and
the
7th
circuit
in
the
recent
oscar
mayer
case
have
all
agreed
that
the
term
wages
has
the
same
essential
meaning
in
the
income
tax
withholding
fica
and
futa
tax
situations.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
lower
court
was
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
repeatedly
refers
to
this
longstanding
treasury
regulation
issued
in
1940.
i
would
remind
the
court
that
as
late
as
1957
in
revenue
ruling
57-471,
in
interpreting
this
very
regulation,
the
internal
revenue
service
said
that
social
security
tax
ruling
302
which
had
invoked
the
convenience
of
the
employer
test
and
said
that
meals
and
lodging
for
the
convenience
were
excludable,
were
still
in
full
force
and
effect.
thus,
the
service
itself,
despite
the
notice
supposedly
given
under
the
regulation,
was
still
interpreting
its
own
regulation
17
years
later
as
applying
the
convenience
of
employer
rule.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
no,
sir.
this
case...
let
me
explain.
in
57-171,
the
service
issued
a
sort
of
a
bifurcated
opinion.
it
ruled
in
that
case
that
meals
and
lodging
for
the
convenience
of
restaurant
employees
were
subject
to
social
security
tax
but
for
reasons
that
fully
escape
me
meals
and
lodging
furnished
for
the
convenience
of
other
employees,
including
bank
and
trust
company
employees,
were
not
subject
to
social
security
tax.
and
it
was
not
until
19--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--that
is
a
revenue
ruling.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
gcms
are
no
longer
issued.
they're
now
called
revenue
rulings,
in
whatever
form,
by
whomever
issued.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
i
assume
so.
most
revenue
rulings
are
prompted
by--
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
--specific
facts.
however,
the
ruling
does
recite
that
sst-302
is
still
in
full
force
and
effect.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
well,
with
all
due
respect,
since
i
filed
many
gcms
myself,
i
can
tell
you
that
they
were
discontinued,
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
1954.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
as
far
as
being
published.
they
are
still
issued,
but
not
published.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
that's
probably
true,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
k.
martin
worthy
certainly,
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
these
people
to
get
meals
and
lodging.
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
that
i
believe
the
government
is
in
error
when
it
says
that
the
4th
circuit
has
held
in
its
favor.
i
believe
the
4th
circuit
in
the
royster
case
made
quite
clear
that
it
considers
the
rules
to
be
identical,
just
as
the
government
had
urged
in
that
case,
for
fica,
futa,
and
income
tax
purposes.
i
believe
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
