i
realize
this
hypothetical
example
is
vastly
different
factually.
but
is
it
much
different
in
principle
from
a
household
which
employs
a
housekeeper
to
come
in
one
day
a
week
and,
for
their
convenience
or
for
her
convenience
furnishes
her
lunch?
justice
rehnquist
--isn't
it
fairly
common
for,
say,
again,
an
employer
of
a
domestic
to
agree
to
pay
the
domestic's
share
of
the
narrower
wage?
justice
rehnquist
now,
were
these
regulations
adopted
in
1954?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
one
of
the
sets
of
regulations,
at
any
rate,
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
government's
present
position?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
was
covered
as
a
saturday
evening
post
carrier.
justice
rehnquist
that's
how
i
got
my
social
security
card.
justice
rehnquist
how
many
courts
of
appeals
have
supported
your
position
other
than
the
5th
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
and
how
many
opposed
it?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
let
me
ask
you
about
a
sentence
on
page
28
of
the
central
illinois
public
service
company
case,
the
beginning,
after
iv,
where
the
court
says,
"the
government
straightforwardly
and
simplistically
argues
that
the
definition
of
3401(a)
corresponds
to
the
first
category
of
gross
income
set
forth
in
section
61(a)(1),
and
that
the
two
statutes,
although
not
entirely
congruent
in
their
relationship,
have
equivalent
scope.
"
do
you
still
take
that
position?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
just
backing
off
one
step
at
a
time.
justice
rehnquist
and
yet
there's
no
vested
right
in
the
benefit.
justice
rehnquist
if
they're
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
congressional
authorization
to
the
commissioner,
they
would
be.
justice
rehnquist
they
go
into
a
special
fund
which
in
turn
buys
government
bonds.
justice
rehnquist
that's
how
the
pensions
are
funded,
with
government
bonds.
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
it
were
set
aside
in
a
vault
somewhere.
