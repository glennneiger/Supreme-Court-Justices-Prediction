mr.
g.
duane
vieth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
regulation
of
the
board
of
governors,
which
is
in
issue
here,
as
well
as
the
interpretive
ruling
of
the
board
which
accompanied
that
order,
were
issued
under
section
4(c)(8)
of
the
bank
holding
company
act.
that
act,
in
general,
prohibits
bank
holding
companies
from
engaging
in
any
non-banking
activities
or
acquiring
subsidiaries
so
engaged.
however,
section
4(c)(8)
does
authorize
the
board
to
permit
certain
non-banking
activities
by
holding
companies
and
their
affiliates,
provided
that
those
activities
are...
and
i
quote
the
statutory
language...
"so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
"
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
the
kind
of
activities
that
the
board's
regulation
and
interpretative
ruling
have
permitted
here
are
activities
that
are
prohibited
to
banks
under
the
glass-steagall
act.
in
that
respect
we
take
direct
contention
with
counsel
for
the
board.
we
submit
that
if
those
activities
are
prohibited
to
banks
by
the
fundamental
national
policy
which
is
embodied
in
the
glass-steagall
act,
then
the
board
may
not
lawfully
find
that
such
activities
are
so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
this
court
in
1971
in
the
camp
decision
set
aside
a
regulation
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
which
authorized
national
banks
to
create
what
amounted
to
open-end
investment
companies
denominated
as
commingled
investment
accounts.
the
court
held
that
such
investment
activity...
company
activity
by
banks
violated
the
glass-steagall
act.
less
than
six
weeks
after
this
court's
decision
in
camp,
the
board
of
governors
promulgated
in
preliminary
form
the
regulation
here
in
issue.
and
as
i've
indicated,
that
regulation
authorized
bank
holding
companies
and
their
affiliates
to
act
as
investment
advisors
to
investment
companies.
now,
it
is
our
first
proposition
that
the
regulation
as
applied
to
banks,
and
if
it
were
to
apply
to
banks,
does
permit
conduct
which
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
in
order
to
illustrate
that
point
it
is
necessary
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
what
is
involved
here
is
the
sponsorship,
with
all
the
term
implies,
the
sponsorship
by
holding
companies
of
investment
companies.
that
narrow
issue
is
the
only
issue
which
is
before
the
court.
after
the
decision
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
below,
the
board
of
governors
petitioned
the
court
for
reconsideration,
and
specifically
pointed
out
that
the
breadth
of
the
court's
order
was
to
outlaw
the
mere
furnishing
of
investment
advice
as
distinct
from
sponsoring
of
investment
companies,
and
protested
the
court's
order
in
that
regard.
in
direct
response
to
this
complaint
the
court
of
appeals
amended
its
opinion
by
adding
a
sentence
to
footnote
13
which
said,
in
substance,
under
the
circumstances
the
court
did
not
reach
and
should
not
be
taken
as
expressing
any
opinion
on
the
question
of
whether
bank
holding
companies
or
their
affiliates
may
either
under
the
regulation
in
issue
or
perhaps
under
one
more
narrowly
drawn
by
the
board,
could
render
solely
investment
advice
as
distinct,
in
the
court's
words,
"as
distinct
from
sponsoring,
organizing,
managing,
or
controlling
such
companies.
"
accordingly,
the
question
of
providing
mere
investment
advice
to
investment
companies
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
narrow
issue
before
this
court
is
the
lawfulness
of
a
regulation
and
the
interpretive
ruling
which
specifically
permits
holding
companies
to
sponsor
investment
companies.
now,
in
order
to
understand
the
importance
of
that
distinction,
i
think
it
would
be
wise
for
me
at
this
point
to
set
forth
the
significant
role
played
by
a
sponsor
in
the
creation
and
organization
and
management
of
an
investment
company,
and
the
activities
the
sponsor
engages
in
with
respect
to
the
issuance
and
sale
of
securities
by
the
investment
company.
it
is
of
fundamental
importance
in
this
regard
to
recognize
and
understand
that
an
investment
company
is
typically
a
naked
shell,
whether
it's
in
corporate
form
or
whether
in
trust
form
or
some
other
form.
usually
it
is
corporate.
but
the
investment
company
itself
has
no
officers,
it
has
no
office,
it
has
no
office
staff.
all
of
the
operating
functions
of
the
typical
investment
company
are
supplied
by
the
sponsor,
the
investment
adviser.
the
sponsor
arranges
for
the
incorporation,
or
rather,
formation
of
the
investment
company.
the
sponsor
registers
the
investment
company
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1340.
the
sponsor
registers
the
securities
to
be
issued
and
sold
by
the
investment
company
with
the
sec
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
the
sponsor
contracts
on
behalf
of
the
investment
company
with
an
underwriter
who
will
distribute
the
company's
securities
to
the
investing
public.
as
the
record
herein
shows,
and
i
believe
this
factor
is
of
utmost
importance,
the
sponsor
in
many
cases
itself
indemnifies
the
underwriter
against
liabilities
which
the
underwriter
may
incur
under
the
federal
securities
laws
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
the
investment
company's
securities.
now,
this
practice
is
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
ordinary
issue
of
corporate
securities
by
a
manufacturing
corporation
or
a
trading
corporation
such
as
a
general
motors.
if
general
motors
issues
securities,
as
it
does
regularly,
it
of
course
must
indemnify
the
underwriter
and
it
and
it
alone
does
indemnify
the
underwriter
against
these
liabilities.
but
in
the
case
of
an
investment
company,
the
sponsor
as
well,
in
addition
to
the
investment
company,
will
issue
the
indemnification.
thereafter
the
sponsor
causes
the
investment
company
to
issue
its
shares
for
sale.
now,
this
initial
activity
of
any
investment
company,
whether
it's
open-end
or
closed-end,
centers
on
the
issuance,
sale,
and
distribution
and
underwriting
of
the
securities
of
the
investment
company.
those
four
words
are
words
taken
directly
from
sections
21
and
16
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
it
is
this
sale
of
securities
which
aggregates
the
capital
for
the
speculative
investment
activities
in
which
the
investment
company
will
engage
under
the
direction
and
management
of
the
sponsor.
as
is
summarized
in
the
affidavit
of
robert
augenblick
in
the
record
herein,
who
at
that
time
was
president
of
the
respondent
investment
company
institute,
appearing
at
record
2283,
paragraph
6,
of
that
affidavit,
the
statement
is
made:
"without
a
successful
initial
sale
of
securities
to
establish
the
pool
of
funds
for
investment
purposes,
a
closed-end
investment
company
cannot
be
a
successful
enterprise.
"
"the
sponsors
and
organizers
of
new
closed-end
investment
companies
are
directly
responsible
for
arranging
for
this
sale
of
securities.
"
now,
of
course,
the
reason
why
the
sponsor
is
responsible
for
these
securities
activities,
including
the
all-important
factor
of
indemnification
of
the
underwriter,
is
of
course
clear.
the
investment
company
itself
does
not
have
the
capability
to
perform
these
or
any
other
activities
for
itself.
there
is
no
one
other
than
the
sponsor
to
perform
them.
and
i
should
emphasize
that
all
of
these
securities
activities
that
i
have
indicated
are
performed
by
the
sponsor,
are
within
the
limits,
are
authorized
by
the
board's
regulation
and
are
within
the
limits
of
the
restrictions
which
counsel
has
referred
to
and
which
are
set
forth
in
the
board's
interpretive
rulings.
now,
we
submit
that
under
the
camp
decision
and
under
the
plain
language
of
sections
21
and
16
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
for
a
bank
to
engage
in
this
type
of
sponsorship
activity,
sponsorship
of
an
investment
company,
it
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
record
in
this
case
over
the
question
of
whether
the
board's
regulation
purports
to
authorize
banks
which
are
members
of
a
holding
company
complex
in
addition
to
bank
holding
companies
and
their
non-bank
affiliates.
whether
the
board's
order
authorizes
the
banks
to
engage
in
these
sponsorship
activities,
notwithstanding
the
language
of
its
interpretive
ruling
which
clearly
states
that
the
term
"bank
holding
companies"
includes
both
banks
and
non-bank
subsidiaries
and
authorizes
the
activity
set
forth...
notwithstanding
that
specific
language,
the
board
now
takes
the
position
that
it
did
not
intend
in
its
ruling
to
authorize
banks
to
do
anything
under
its
regulation.
however,
the
record
shows
that
while,
from
passage
of
glass-steagall
until
1971,
no
banks
had
sponsored
closed-end
investment
companies
in
this
country,
a
flurry
of
closed-end
investment
companies,
many
of
which
were
sponsored
by
banks,
were
organized
following
the
board's
regulation,
and
the
prospectuses
for
a
good
many
of
those
investment
companies,
specifically
referred
to
the
board's
regulation
as
authority
for
the
banks
to
engage
in
the
activities.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
the
ambiguity
in
the
board's
ruling
but
finally
decided
to
accept
the
board's
current
explanation
of
its
limited
intent.
now,
however
this
issue
may
be,
we
submit
that
the
issue
of
whether
banks
may
lawfully
act
as
sponsors
to
closed-end
investment
companies
is
squarely
presented
in
this
case.
as
counsel
has
indicated
in
his
argument,
and
has
forcefully
urged
in
the
reply
brief
for
the
board
as
well
as
in
the
proceedings
before
the
board
itself,
the
contention
is
squarely
made
that
banks
may
sponsor
closed-end
investment
companies
provided
they
operate
within
the
limitations
and
the
restrictions
of
the
board's
rulings.
we
submit,
on
the
contrary,
that
for
a
bank
to
engage
in
the
sponsorship
of
investment
companies,
to
engage
in
the
activities
which
i
have
just
recounted,
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
we
submit
that
it
follows
that
if
conduct
by
a
bank
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
fundamental
national
policy
of
glass-steagall,
then
it
cannot
be
held
that
that
activity
is
so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
the
proper
incident
thereto.
section
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act
in
terms
prohibits
any
bank
from
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
selling,
or
distributing
securities.
we
submit
that
the
activities
which
i
have
outlined
clearly
constitute
the
business
of
issuing
and
selling
securities.
without
the
successful
issuance
and
sale
of
these
securities,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
investment
company
could
not
operate.
and
as
i
have
noted,
the
sponsor
is
the
only
one
to
conduct
those
operations
for
the
investment
company.
now,
the
board
urges
that
section
21
would
not
be
violated
by
a
bank
because
of
the
restrictions
on
the
marketing
activity
which
counsel
has
referred
to,
and
which
are
set
fourth
in
the
record.
it
contends
that
those
restrictions
prevent
the
bank
from
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing,
underwriting,
selling,
or
distributing
securities.
but
for
the
reasons
we
have
shown,
during
this
initial
organization
and
sponsorship
of
a
closed-end
investment
company,
the
principal
business
of
that
company,
indeed,
virtually
the
only
business
of
the
company
and
of
its
sponsor
is
the
issuance
and
sale
of
the
investment
company's
securities.
this,
we
submit,
is
clearly
engagement
by
the
sponsor
in
the
business
of
issuing
and
selling
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
21.
the
other
section
of
the
glass-steagall
act
which
would
be
violated
by
a
bank
which
would
engage
in
this
sponsorship
activity
is
section
16,
which
is
applicable
to
national
banks
and
state
banks
which
are
members
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
that
section
provides
that
the
business
of
dealing
in
securities
and
stock
by
a
national
bank
or
a
state
member
bank
shall
be
limited
to
purchasing
and
selling
such
securities
without
recourse,
solely
upon
the
order
and
for
the
account
of
customers.
now,
with
respect
to
this
section,
the
board
contends
that
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
for
the
investment
company,
which
as
you
read
it
involves
purchases
and
sales
for
a
bank
customer,
as
permitted
by
section
16,
the
argument
is
that
a
bank
may
create
its
own
customer
and
then
conduct
securities
activities
for
that
customer,
and
that
is
within
an
exception
set
forth
in
section
16.
we
submit
that
this
identical
argument
was
submitted
to
this
court
back
in
1970
with
respect
to
the
camp
decision,
where
it
was
urged
that
the
commingled
investment
fund
created
by
the
bank
in
that
case
was
nothing
more
than
a
bank
customer
or
perhaps
the
investors
in
that
fund
were
a
series
of
bank
customers
and
that
what
the
bank
was
doing
did
not
violate
section
16.
in
the
camp
decision
this
court
clearly
distinguished
between
the
activities
of
a
bank
in
undertaking
to
purchase
stock
for
the
account
of
its
individual
customers...
and
i'm
quoting
the
language
of
the
court,
there,
on
the
one
hand,
and
again,
in
the
language
of
the
court,
the
operation
of
an
investment
fund
on
the
other.
i
am
quoting
from
page
638
of
the
court's
opinion
in
which
the
court
said,
referring
to
certain
hazards
with
respect
to
bank
involvement
in
investment
company
activity,
"these
are
all
hazards
that
are
not
present
when
a
bank
undertakes
to
purchase
stock
for
the
account
of
its
individual
customers
or
to
commingle
assets
which
it
has
received
for
a
true
fiduciary
purpose
rather
than
for
investment.
"
"these
activities,
unlike
the
operation
of
an
investment
fund,
do
not
give
rise
to
a
promotional
or
salesman's
stake
in
a
particular
investment.
"
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
i
am
reading
from
camp.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
it
was
mr.
justice
blackmun
who
did
dissent.
now,
this
is
page
638
of
camp.
"they
do
not
involve
an
enterprise
in
direct
competition
with
aggressively
promoted
funds.
"
"they
do
not
entail
a
threat
to
public
confidence.
"
and
so
forth.
and
then
the
court
concluded:
"in
short,
there
is
a
plain
difference
between
the
sale
of
fiduciary
services
and
the
sale
of
investments.
"
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation.
we
submit
that,
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
rejected
that
argument
in
camp,
it
should
be
rejected
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
no,
sir,
camp
dealt
with
an
open-end
fund
that
was
directly
sponsored
by
the
bank.
we
submit
also
that
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
suggests
that
the
formation
of
investment
companies
of
this
kind
was
one
of
the
evils
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with,
particularly
when
it
was
dealing
with
so-called
bank
affiliates.
in
the
legislative
proceedings,
particularly
the
hearings
before
the
subcommittee
of
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee,
the
landmark
hearings
with
respect
to
glass-steagall
in
the
71st
congress,
an
intensive
investigation
of
security
affiliates
was
undertaken.
and
i
quote
now
from
the
hearings,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
51,
"an
analysis
of
the
operations
of
a
number
of
typical
security
affiliates
reveals
a
wide
variety
of
activities.
"
"the
more
important
functions
which
they
exercise
are
the
following.
"
and
then
number
one
was
acting
as
a
wholesaler
of
securities;
number
two,
a
retailer
of
securities;
number
three,
holding
and
finance
companies;
and
now
we
come
to
the
important
one
that
i'd
like
to
quote,
number
four.
that
is,
exercise
the
following:
"(4)
investment
trusts...
buying,
and
selling
securities
acquired
purely
for
investment
or
speculative
purposes.
"
now,
we
submit
that
the
kind
of
a
security
affiliate
referred
to
by
the
congress
under
item
4
in
those
hearings
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
an
affiliate
that's
involved
in
this
case,
namely
a
closed-end
investment
company
which
buys
and
sells
securities
acquired
purely
for
investment
or
speculative
purposes.
now,
as
the
board
has
indicated
and
as
the
record
shows,
the
board
has
drawn
a
distinction
between
sponsorship
of
closed-end
funds
and
sponsorship
of
open-end
funds.
the
board
concedes
that
sponsorship
of
an
open-end
fund
is
prohibited,
but
it
holds
that
a
sponsorship
of
a
closed-end
fund
is
permitted.
and
yet,
the
fact
is
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
investment
companies
and
investment
trusts
which
were
in
existence
in
1929
and
1930
at
the
time
the
glass-steagall
legislation
was
being
considered,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
them
were
closed-end
funds.
in
fact,
the
sec
records
which
are
cited
at
page
27
of
our
brief
show
that
of
all
assets
held
by
investment
companies
in
1929
and
1930,
95
percent
were
closed-end
companies
and
only
five
percent
were
open-end
companies.
so
we
submit
that
not
only
does
the
language
of
glass-steagall
prohibit
bank
sponsorship
of
closed-end
investment
companies,
but
the
legislative
history
discloses
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
prohibit
that
sponsorship.
and
this
court's
camp
decision,
of
course,
is
squarely
in
point.
now,
we
come
then
to
the
second
leg
of
our
argument.
if
in
fact
banks
are
prohibited
from
sponsoring
closed-end
investment
companies,
as
we
submit
unmistakably
they
are,
then
we
further
submit
that
the
board
may
not
lawfully
under
section
4(c)(8)
permit
bank
holding
companies
to
engage
in
those
identical
activities
on
the
ground
that
they
are...
i'm
quoting
the
statute,
"so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
"
counsel
for
the
board
argues
that
bank
holding
company
legislation
was
intended
to
permit
the
board
to
authorize
activities
in
which
banks
may
not
engage.
and
that
of
course,
is
true,
to
a
limited
extent.
the
holding
company
act
does
permit
the
board
to
authorize
holding
companies
to
engage
in
activities
which
would
be
ultra
vires
of
banking.
but
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
something
far
more
than
activities
which
would
be
merely
ultra
vires.
what
is
involved
here
are
activities
that
are
specifically
prohibited
by
the
fundamental
national
policy
which
is
embodied
in
glass-steagall,
acts
which,
under
section
21,
we
submit
it
would
be
illegal
for
a
bank
engage
in.
it
is
our
position
that
under
section
4(c)(8)
the
standard
of
closely
related
and
proper
incident
cannot
be
met
by
permitting
activities
by
a
holding
company
which
are
so
positively
prohibited
to
banks
themselves.
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
1956
act
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
administered
by
the
board
following
passage
makes
this
clear.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
chairman
martin...
william
mcchesney
martin...
was
chairman
of
the
board
at
the
time
the
1956
holding
company
act
was
passed,
and
was
chairman
of
the
board
throughout
its
entire
administration
right
until
the
1970
amendments
to
that
act
were
passed.
chairman
martin
testified
in
1969
in
connection
with
the
1970
amendments,
in
referring
to
the
holding
company
act,
he
said,
"the
congress
took
steps
years
ago
in
the
banking
act
of
1933.
"
--i
interpolate,
the
glass-steagall
act...
"to
separate
banking
from
non-banking
businesses,
policy
that
was
reinforced
by
the
bank
holding
company
act
of
1956,
as
to
companies
that
owned
two
or
more
banks.
"
i
think
chairman
martin
was
clearly
correct,
that
the
congress
in
passing
the
holding
company
act
intended
to
reinforce
the
policies
and
principles
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
so
far
as
is
known,
no
holding
company
attempted
to
sponsor
an
investment
company,
closed-end
or
open-end,
during
the
period
between
1956
and
1970.
and
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
1956
act
would
not
have
permitted
that
sort
of
activity.
the
only
question
remaining,
then,
is
whether
the
1970
amendments
to
section
4(c)(8)
somehow
or
other
demonstrated
a
congressional
intent
to
broaden
the
power
of
the
board
to
authorize
activities
by
bank
holding
companies.
now,
as
the
court
below
noted,
there
was
a
massive
struggle
in
connection
with
the
1970
amendments
between
the
congressional
proponents
of
much
broadened
permissible
activities
for
bank
holding
companies,
and
the
congressional
opponents
of
such
broadening,
and
who
intended
to
restrict
even
further
the
permissible
activity
of
bank
holding
companies.
in
the
middle
of
that
struggle,
i
might
say,
was
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
which
came
down
on
the
side
of
some
broadening
and
suggested
that
the
language
so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
an
incident
thereto,
be
eliminated
and
that
a
functionally
related
test
be
substituted.
i
might
also
say
that
during
the
course
of
that
legislative
struggle
an
attempt
was
made
to
resolve
by
congressional
action
the
very
issue
which
was
wending
its
way
through
the
federal
court
system
and
ultimately
decided
by
this
court
in
1971,
in
the
camp
case.
now,
the
outcome
of
that
struggle
was,
as
the
court
below
indicated,
a
compromise.
in
the
first
place,
the
attempt
to
legislate
the
result
in
the
camp
case
failed.
secondly,
the
position,
which
was
essentially
the
position
of
the
administration
at
that
time,
substantially
broadened;
section
4(c)(8)
was
not
adopted.
the
board
of
governors'
proposed
middle
ground
or
compromise
substituting
the
language
"functionally
related"
was
not
adopted.
and
i
might
say
that
in
submitting
that
proposed
middle
ground,
the
board
suggested
that
one
of
the
types
of
activities
that
in
its
view
would
be
within
the
standard
of
"functionally
related",
was
acting
as
an
investment
advisor
to
investment
companies.
the
senate
basically
had
been
in
favor
of
the
broadening
of
the
activities
permissible
to
bank
holding
companies.
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
other
hand
was
more
or
less
determined
not
to
permit
the
broadening.
and
indeed,
the
bill
that
passed
the
house
of
representatives
contained
a
so-called
negative
laundry
list
specifically
outlawing
certain
types
of
activities
to
bank
holding
companies
and
banks
and
their
affiliates.
and
one
of
the
items
on
the
negative
laundry
list
was
the
kind
of
activity
involved
in
this
case,
the
sponsorship
of
investment
companies.
as
the
final
bill
makes
clear,
neither
side
clearly
prevailed
in
this
struggle.
but
i
think
that
the
important
thing
for
this
court
to
recognize
is
that
the
language
of
section
4(c)(8)
insofar
as
it's
relevant
to
this
proceeding
remained
exactly
the
same.
the
test
had
been
in
1956
and
from
then
on
so
closely
related
to
the
business
of
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
after
the
1970
amendments,
that
same
language
remained
the
same.
there
was
only
one
change
and
that
is
that
the
words,
"the
business
of
banking"
were
removed
from
the
standard.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
that
deletion
was
made
solely
to
overcome
a
series
of
rulings
by
the
board
which
previously
had
held
under
the
1956
act
that
the
activities
which
were
lawful
for
a
bank
holding
company
had
to
be
related
directly
to
the
banks
which
were
owned
or
controlled
by
that
holding
company.
in
other
words,
the
holding
companies
could
not
engage
broadly
in
that
type
of
activity
but
had
to
limit
their
activities
to
support
of
the
very
banks
in
their
own
holding
company
complex.
that
limitation
was
removed
but
only
that;
that
was
the
only
effect
of
a
change
in
the
1970
amendments.
so
that
we
submit,
once
again,
that
activity
of
the
kind
that
is
involved
here...
and
it
is
only
sponsorship
of
closed-end
investment
companies...
is
not
permissible
to
banks.
it's
directly
prohibited
to
banks
under
the
glass-steagall
act,
and
that
it
may
not
then
lawfully
be
held
that
such
activity,
which
is
positively
prohibited
to
banks,
may
be
characterized
as
so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes,
sir.
it
is
made
up
of
virtually
all
of
the
open-end
investment
companies
in
this
country,
their
investment
advisors,
and
their
principal
underwriters.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes.
one
of
our
members
would
have
had
standing
to
seek
review--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--well,
in
the
first
place,
if
your
honor
please,
under
section
1850,
12
u.s.c.
1850
of
the
holding
company
act,
a
competitor
has
standing
to
challenge
a
ruling
of
the
board,
and
i
believe
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
sierra
case
an
association
of
competitors
also
has
standing
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
individual
members.
and
indeed
the
standing
question
was
squarely
raised
and
disposed
of
by
this
court
in
the
1971
camp
case.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
yes,
sir,
i
do.
and
that
is
alleged
in
the
record,
as
the
court
below
notes,
it
was
alleged
in
the
proceedings
before
the
board
and,
indeed,
in
the
first
time
around
in
proceedings
before
the
district
court.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
it
was
a
restrictive
view
of
standing,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
i
believe
it
was
case
or
controversy.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well,
in
the
first
place--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--i'm
trying
to
think,
i
guess
the
1970
amendment
that
i
refer
to,
that
conferred
the
standing,
was
a
month
or
two
before--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--i
was
going
to
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
within
a...
i
believe
the
1970
amendments
were
passed
in
december
of
1970.
this
court's
decision
in
camp
was
in
april
of
1971,
and
clearly,
and
squarely
dealt
with
that
issue,
that
issue
which,
incidentally,
was
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
camp
case
and
argued
in
the
briefs
and
before
this
court.
it
was
not
argued
in
this
case.
i
should
say,
it
was
argued
before
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
well,
yes,
it
was
open
again...
against
open-end
in
a
sense,
but--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--yes,
sir,
but
it
has
been
alleged,
and
the
court
has
accepted
and
it's
not
been
challenged
by
the
government,
so
far
as
i
know--
mr.
g.
duane
vieth
--that
they
are
competitors.
it
was
alleged
that
they're
not
competitors
and
it
has
not
been
challenged,
that
allegation
has
not
been
challenged.
