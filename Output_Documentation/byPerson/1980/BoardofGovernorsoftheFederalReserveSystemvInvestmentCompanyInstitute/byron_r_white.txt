mr.
vieth,
could
i
ask
you
something
i
should
have
asked
you
earlier?
justice
white
your
client
is
an
institute
made
up
of
open-end
investment
companies?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
one
of
your
members
as
well
have
sought
review
of
this
ruling?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
either
one
of
you
have
standing
to
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
curious
about
the...
you
say
open-end
companies
and
closed-end
companies
compete?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
in
old
cases
that
say
competitors
don't
have
standing
to
sue?
was
it
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
what?
of
case
or
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
congress
just
create
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
it
were
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
just
can't
confer
standing
unless
there's
a
case
or
controversy,--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
know,
but
it
wasn't...
open-end
companies
were
involved
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
this
is
closed
against
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
are
competitors?
