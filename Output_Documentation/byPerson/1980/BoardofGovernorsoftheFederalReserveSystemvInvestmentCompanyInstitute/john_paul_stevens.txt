justice
john
paul
stevens
this
--
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
ruling
by
the
federal
reserve
board
which
interprets
the
bank
holding
company
act
to
allow
investment
advisory
services
to
be
performed
for
closed-end
investment
companies
by
nonbank
subsidiaries
of
bank
holding
companies.
the
ruling
was
challenged
by
an
association
of
open-end
investment
companies
and
held
to
be
invalid
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
in
an
opinion
which
we
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
explained
at
some
length
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
action
of
the
federal
reserve
board
was
consistent
with
the
statutes
that
are
connected
with
this
--
this
matter
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
insofar
as
the
members
of
the
court
who
participated.
there
are
six
members
who
participated.
justices
stewart,
powell,
and
rehnquist
did
not
participate
in
the
decision
of
the
case.
