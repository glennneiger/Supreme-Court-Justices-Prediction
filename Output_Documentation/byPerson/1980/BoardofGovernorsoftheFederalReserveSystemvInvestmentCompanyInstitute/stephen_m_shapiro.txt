mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
set
aside
a
regulation
of
the
federal
reserve
board
which
authorizes
bank
holding
companies
and
their
non-bank
subsidiaries
to
organize
and
manage
closed-end
investment
companies
within
a
framework
of
restrictions
and
safeguards
prescribed
by
the
board.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
board's
regulation
infringes
either
the
glass-steagall
act
or
the
bank
holding
company
act.
we
contend
that
neither
statute
stands
in
the
way
of
the
board's
regulation,
and
that
the
regulation
is
a
lawful
exercise
of
the
authority
vested
in
the
board
by
congress.
after
summarizing
the
essential
provisions
of
the
regulation,
i'd
like
to
explain
why
it's
consistent
with
both
of
these
statutes.
in
a
nutshell,
the
board's
regulation
permits
bank
holding
companies
and
their
non-bank
subsidiaries
to
organize
or
sponsor
a
closed-end
investment
company
and
then
to
manage
the
company
and
its
investment
portfolio.
after
a
public
hearing
the
board
determined
that
this
activity
is
closely
related
to
banking
and
is
a
proper
incident.
but
to
insure
that
the
authorized
activity
would
not
infringe
the
glass-steagall
act,
the
board
prescribed
a
code
of
restrictions,
restrictions
which
it
pointed
out
were
even
more
stringent
than
necessary
to
satisfy
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
restrictions
provide
that
bank
holding
companies
may
sponsor
and
organize
only
closed-end
investment
companies
which
issue
their
securities
infrequently.
they
may
not
participate
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
offering,
sale,
or
distribution
of
the
securities
of
an
investment
company.
the
holding
company
and
its
subsidiaries
are
forbidden
to
distribute
prospectuses
or
sales
literature,
to
give
the
names
of
bank
customers
to
the
investment
company
or
its
underwriters,
to
express
opinions
about
the
investment
company
shares,
or
to
purchase
any
of
those
shares
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
to
insure
that
bank
assets
are
not
placed
at
risk,
bank
holding
companies
and
their
subsidiaries
are
forbidden
to
buy
shares
of
the
investment
company
for
their
own
account
or
to
lend
any
money
to
the
investment
company.
despite
these
and
other
safeguards
which
were
prescribed
by
the
board,
respondent
investment
company
institute
argued
before
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
board's
regulation
violated
sections
16
and
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
both
contentions.
nonetheless,
the
court
ruled
that
the
board's
regulation
was
invalid
under
the
bank
holding
company
act.
the
court
identified
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
which
led
to
that
conclusion,
but
instead
relied
on
what
it
called
the
policies
of
the
glass-steagall
act
which,
it
said,
carried
forward
and
informed
the
meaning
of
the
later
enacted
bank
holding
company
act.
the
objection
to
this
ruling
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
either
the
glass-steagall
act
or
the
bank
holding
company
act
which
supports
the
court
of
appeals
policy
analysis.
indeed,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
need
look
no
further
than
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutes
themselves
in
order
to
affirm
the
action
of
the
administrative
agency.
examination
of
the
literal
terms
of
the
glass-steagall
act
shows
that
there
is
no
provision
which
forbids
what
the
board
has
permitted.
congress
prescribed
several
provisions
in
the
glass-steagall
act,
which
apply
to
different
entities
in
the
bank
holding
company
system.
separate
rules
are
prescribed
for
banks
and
for
bank
affiliates
such
as
bank
holding
companies.
bank
affiliates
are
forbidden
to
engage
principally
in
the
issuance,
underwriting,
or
distribution
of
securities.
neither
a
closed-end
investment
company
nor
a
bank
holding
company
which
manages
the
investment
company
would
run
afoul
of
that
statutory
provision.
a
closed-end
investment
company
does
not
engage
principally
in
the
issuance
or
distribution
of
securities
because
by
definition
a
closed
end
investment
company
is
a
company
which
issues
its
shares
only
when
it's
organized
and
on
infrequent
occasions
thereafter.
in
this
respect
it's
identical
with
any
other
business
corporation,
including
banks
and
bank
holding
companies
themselves,
which
issue
their
securities
when
they're
organized.
it's
quite
the
opposite
of
an
open
end
investment
company
which
continuously
engages
in
securities
issuance
or
an
investment
banking
firm
which
is
continuously
engaged
in
offering
and
distributing
securities
to
the
investing
public.
if
congress
had
meant
to
prohibit
affiliations
between
banks
and
all
companies
that
offer
securities
when
they're
organized,
it
surely
would
not
have
written
the
statute
the
way
it
did.
it
would
have
forbidden
all
corporate
affiliates
that
issue
securities,
not
just
affiliates
that
issue
securities
principally,
or
engage
principally
in
the
issuance
of
securities.
nor
is
it
possible,
we
submit,
for
a
bank
holding
company
that
manages
a
closed-end
investment
company
to
become
principally
engaged
in
the
issuance
and
distribution
of
securities
in
violation
of
section
20.
the
bank
holding
company
does
not
issue
any
securities
at
all
under
this
regulation,
and
is
completely
insulated
from
the
process
by
which
the
securities
of
the
investment
company
are
distributed
and
underwritten
to
the
public.
respondent's
contrary
views
under
the
glass-steagall
act
rest
largely
on
this
court's
decision
in
investment
company
institute
v.
camp,
but
that
case
is
different,
we
submit,
from
this
case
in
almost
every
relevant
respect.
camp
dealt
with
the
activities
of
a
bank,
not
a
bank
affiliate
such
as
a
bank
holding
company.
the
court
held
in
camp
that
a
bank
could
not
issue
and
underwrite
the
securities
of
an
investment
fund,
which
the
court
said
was
the
equivalent
of
an
open-end
fund
or
a
mutual
fund.
in
this
case
the
board
has
forbidden
banks,
bank
holding
companies,
and
their
non-bank
subsidiaries
to
engage
in
underwriting
or
promotional
activities
of
any
kind.
and
in
addition
the
board
was
at
pains
to
prescribe
safeguards
to
prevent
the
kinds
of
abuses
and
unsound
banking
practices
which
this
court
discussed
in
camp.
most
importantly,
bank
assets
are
not
permitted
to
be
placed
at
risk
under
this
regulation.
no
entity
in
the
holding
company
system
can
buy
securities
from
the
investment
company
advisee
or
lend
any
money
to
it.
in
short,
there
is
no
more
risk
of
financial
loss
and
no
more
risk
of
unsound
banking
practices
than
when
a
bank
sets
up
and
manages
a
common
trust
fund
or
a
pooled
employee
benefit
fund
within
its
own
trust
department.
respondent
devotes
considerable
argument
in
its
brief
to
the
idea
that
a
bank
holding
company
for
a
non-bank
subsidiary
operating
under
this
regulation
might
violate
section
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
there
are
two
separate
answers
to
this
assertion.
in
the
first
place,
section
21
applies
only
to
deposit-receiving
entities
as
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
federal
reserve
board
agreed.
it
therefore
has
no
bearing
on
the
activities
of
bank
holding
companies
and
their
non-bank
subsidiaries
which
do
not
engage
in
the
business
of
receiving
deposits.
and
in
the
second
place,
even
if
section
21
did
apply
to
a
bank
holding
company,
it
would
not
be
violated
by
the
activities
which
the
board
has
permitted
here.
section
21
forbids
engaging
in
the
business
of
issuing
or
underwriting
securities.
bank
holding
companies
are
not
the
issuers
of
any
securities
under
this
regulation
and
they're
completely
cut
off
from
the
process
by
which
the
securities
of
the
investment
company
are
underwritten
and
distributed
to
the
public.
in
sum,
we
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
glass-steagall
act
that
forbids
the
activities
which
the
board
has
permitted.
nor
is
it
appropriate,
we
submit,
to
infer
policies
from
the
act
which
differ
from
its
plain
meaning.
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
potential
dangers
that
can
result
from
particular
involvement
in
given
securities
activities
by
banking
organizations.
in
light
of
that
potential,
it
prohibited
certain
activities
and
it
left
certain
other
activities
untouched.
as
governor
myer
of
the
federal
reserve
board
testified
before
congress
in
1933,
and
i
quote,
"it's
impossible
to
classify
absolutely
all
affiliates
that
engage
in
securities
transactions
as
wicked
and
vicious.
"
senator
glass
replied,
"we're
not
classifying
all
of
them,
and
we're
not
intending
to
reach
all
of
them.
"
this
is
a
significant
colloquy,
we
submit,
between
the
senate
draftsman
for
the
glass-steagall
act,
the
principal
draftsman,
and
the
governor
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
who
proposed
the
language
which
congress
later
adopted
in
section
20.
in
light
of
this
measured
statutory
objective,
there
is
no
warrant
for
extending
the
carefully
formulated
prohibitions
which
congress
has
actually
enacted.
respondent's
assertions
find
no
more
support
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
than
they
do
under
glass-steagall.
the
board
adopted
this
regulation
under
section
4(c)(8)
of
the
bank
holding
company
act.
that's
a
provision
which
empowers
the
board
to
designate
certain
nonbanking
activities
as
closely
related
to
banking
and
as
proper
incidents.
section
4(c)(8)
itself
neither
permits
nor
prohibits
any
particular
activities.
it
leaves
to
the
expert
judgment
of
the
board
the
question
whether
a
given
activity
is
closely
related
to
banking
and
is
a
proper
incident.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
provision
vests
in
the
board
a
significant
amount
of
discretion,
as
this
court
observed
last
term
in
the
bt
investment
managers
case.
it's
plain
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
it
contains
no
prohibition
against
sponsorship
and
management
of
a
closed
end
investment
company.
nor
should
any
such
prohibition
be
implied.
section
4(c)(7)
of
the
act,
which
is
the
next-door
neighbor,
if
you
will
of
section
4(c)(8),
expressly
provides
that
bank
holding
companies
may
purchase
any
or
all
of
the
shares
of
a
closed-end
investment
company.
and
under
the
statute
they're
also
permitted
to
provide
management
services
and
to
control
the
investment
company
subsidiary.
congress's
express
approval
of
these
activities
for
bank
holding
companies
under
section
4(c)(7)
is
a
rather
clear
indication
that
it
did
not
mean
to
foreclose
the
more
limited
activities
at
issue
in
this
case
under
the
flexible
standard
of
section
4(c)(8).
the
legislative
history
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
is
completely
barren
of
any
indication
that
congress
meant
to
forbid
sponsorship
and
management
of
a
closed-end
investment
company.
in
fact,
the
senate
report
that
accompanied
the
1970
amendments
states
explicitly
that
section
4(c)(8)
was
not
intended
to
prejudice
the
right
of
bank
holding
companies
to
operate
investment
companies
to
the
extent
permitted
under
existing
law.
and
as
the
chairman
of
the
conference
committee
that
produced
the
current
version
of
section
4(c)(8)
emphasized,
this
statute
was
not
intended
to
enlarge
or
to
contract
the
prohibitions
contained
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
in
short,
section
4(c)(8)
contains
no
prohibition
of
the
activities
that
are
in
question
here.
and
since
the
glass-steagall
act
does
not
forbid
those
activities
either,
the
glass-steagall
act
can
hardly
be
relied
on
as
a
basis
for
narrowly
interpreting
section
4(c)(8)
to
foreclose
those
same
activities.
respondent's
central
argument
under
the
bank
holding
company
act
is
that
bank
holding
companies
should
not
be
permitted
to
engage
in
this
activity
because
this
activity
would
be
improper
if
undertaken
by
a
bank.
with
deference
to
counsel,
i
am
compelled
to
say
that
this
argument
is
both
irrelevant
and
it's
erroneous.
we
say
it's
irrelevant
because
both
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
the
glass-steagall
act
recognize
that
bank
holding
companies
may
engage
in
a
significantly
broader
range
of
securities-related
activities
than
may
banks.
we
say
the
argument
is
erroneous
because
even
banks
may
engage
in
this
activity
if
they
adhere
faithfully
to
the
restrictions
and
the
safeguards
prescribed
by
the
board.
those
restrictions
assure
that
the
investment
advisor
neither
underwrites
securities
nor
invests
any
assets
in
the
investment
company
or
purchases
any
of
the
securities.
for
this
reason
there
is
no
way
that
a
bank
operating
within
the
board's
restrictions
would
infringe
the
glass-steagall
act
prohibitions
and
standards
which
apply
to
banks.
i
should
also
make
brief
reference
to
the
policy
arguments
that
respondent
asserts
at
the
end
of
its
brief.
those
contentions,
we
submit,
are
properly
addressed
to
congress
and
not
to
the
judiciary.
in
the
camp
case
this
court
relied
on
considerations
of
general
statutory
purpose
and
policy
as
additional
reasons
for
enforcing
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute.
but
in
his
case
respondent
is
raising
policy
arguments
as
a
reason
to
enlarge
the
literal
terms
and
prohibitions
of
the
statute.
as
this
court's
recent
decisions
make
clear,
this
is
an
inappropriate
judicial
function.
statutes
can't
be
revised
in
light
of
policy
arguments,
and
it's
especially
inappropriate
here
where
respondent
asks
the
court,
in
effect,
to
formulate
new
prohibitions
to
protect
it
against
competition,
competition
which
the
antitrust
division
pointed
out
before
the
board
would
be
highly
beneficial
to
the
investing
public.
as
was
shown
in
our
briefs,
the
potential
hazards
that
respondent
discusses
are
amply
protected
against
under
existing
law.
and
if
new
abuses
should
arise,
the
board
is
competent
to
deal
with
them
as
it
explained
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
i
should
like
to
conclude
this
perhaps
too-technical
discussion
by
recalling
that
the
statutes
that
are
before
the
court
today
are
statutes
that
congress
charged
the
board
with
enforcing.
as
this
court
stated
only
two
terms
ago
in
reference
to
the
board,
in
the
first
lincolnwood
case,
"courts
should
defer
to
an
agency's
construction
of
its
own
statutory
mandate.
"
the
reason
for
that
deference
was
explained
by
justices
frankfurter
and
rutledge
in
their
concurring
opinion
in
board
of
governors
v.
agnew,
and
i
quote:
"not
only
because
congress
has
committed
the
system's
operation
to
their
hands,
but
also
because
the
system
itself
is
a
highly
specialized
and
technical
one
requiring
expert
and
coordinated
judgment
in
all
its
phases.
"
i
think
their
judgment
should
be
conclusive
on
any
matter
such
as
this
which--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--he
was
referring
to
the
federal
reserve
board's
supervision
of
the
securities
industry
in
an
analogous
situation,
and
he
said
that,
"the
board's
judgment
should
be
conclusive
on
any
matter
such
as
this
which
is
open
to
reasonable
differences
of
opinion.
"
in
this
case
we
submit,
the
board's
interpretation
rests
comfortably
on
the
literal
text
of
the
statutory
provisions.
but
even
if
the
matter
were
subject
to
ambiguity,
the
court
below
should
have
deferred
to
the
board's
expert
judgment
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
require.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
ask
your
permission
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
not
detain
the
court
over-long.
all
of
the
arguments,
i
believe,
that
have
been
raised
here
today
by
respondent
are
addressed
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
won't
rehash
those
matters.
i
would
like
to
leave
one
parting
thought
with
the
court,
however,
and
that
is
that
this
is
obviously
a
complicated
case,
the
facts
themselves,
the
particularities
of
the
financial
institutions,
and
the
statutes
are
complicated.
and
the
court
will
be
without
a
compass,
i
would
submit,
unless
it
returns
to
the
plain
meaning
of
these
statutes,
the
literal
terms.
section
20
of
the
glass-steagall
act
says
that
affiliates
of
banks,
including
bank
holding
companies,
may
not
engage
principally
in
the
issuance
or
underwriting
of
securities.
now
this
regulation
doesn't
permit
any
bank
holding
company
or
any
bank
to
engage
in
those
activities
at

section
4(c)(8)
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
vests
in
the
board
the
decision
whether
a
particular
activity
is
closely
related
to
banking
and
is
a
proper
incident.
the
question
whether
you
have
a
proper
incident
turns
on
a
weighing
of
social
benefits
against
disadvantages,
conflicts
of
interest,
et
cetera;
factors
that
congress
has
enumerated
in
the
statute
for
the
board
to
consider.
again,
there
is
no
prohibition
in
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
of
the
activities
that
are
permitted
here.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
for
a
point-by-point
response
to
the
contentions
that
have
been
raised
today.
thank
you.
