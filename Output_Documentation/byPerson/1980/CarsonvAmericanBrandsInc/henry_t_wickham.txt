mr.
henry
t.
wickham
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
counsel
left
out
another
very
good
reason
to
avoid
piecemeal
litigation,
and
i
think
that
the
two
opinions
filed
in
the
4th
circuit
bear
this
out,
and
that
is
they're
interfering
with
the
orderly
processes
of
trial
court.
and
i
think
the
reading
of
the
two
opinions
in
the
4th
circuit
shows
exactly
the
type
of
jungle
that
we're
getting
ourselves
into,
permitting
appeals
of
the
nature
that
stands
before
this
court.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that's
correct,
but
it's
also
the
views
expressed
by
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
concerning
what
the
trial
court
did
hold.
did
he
hold
conclusively
that
the
plaintiffs
had
no
case
on
the
merits,
or
did
he
hold
his
actions
were
a
collateral
order?
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
it
just
shows
you
where
the
appellate
court
should
not
be,
in
an
order
of
this
type.
the
dissenting
opinion
went
on
to
say
that
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion,
that...
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
it
went
into
the
merits
of
the
case
and
stated
what
they
thought
were
the
merits
of
this
case,
and
i
think
that
this
whole
case
illustrates
that
this
type
of
order
should
be,
could
not
be
appealed
until
it
becomes
final.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
your
honor,
after
28
months
had
passed
from
the
time
the
trial
court
had
this
case
until
it
got
back,
we
did
file
a
motion
requesting
a
pretrial
conference
for
the
purpose
of
setting
a
trial
date,
and
in
that
motion
we
stated
that
we
now
withdrew
consent
to
the
proposed
decree.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
we
went
to
the
pretrial
conference
and
the
trial
date
was
set
for
this
case.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no
further
order
was
entered
or
no
further
mention
was
made
of
the
respondent's
motion
to
withdraw
its
consent.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
we
did
not
make
any
formal
motion
except
in
the
motion
to
ask
for
a
pretrial
conference
and
to
set
a
trial
date.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
we
took,
actually,
no
position,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
we
feel
that
changed
circumstances
would
be
a
consideration
for
the
trial
court
if
we'd
made
a
formal
motion
to
withdraw
out
consent.
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
rule
60(b)
motion.
in
effect,
the
consent
decree
could
be
entered
and
then
it
would
be
a
60(b)
motion.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir,
that
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
why
we're
here
today,
as
i
see
it
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
was
made
after
the
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case.
we
made
no
request
at
all
when
this
case
was
appealed
from
the
trial
court
and
then
some
28
months
later
it
finally
got
back
to
the
trial
court
and
at
that
time
we
made
a
request
for
a
jury
trial.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
think
it
would
have
any
jurisdiction
at
that
time.
i
think
that
was--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
know
we
had
withdrawn
our
consent.
our
consent
was
not
withdrawn
until
after
the
court
of
appeals...
after
the
mandate
issued
and
it
had
returned
to
the
district
court,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
the
district
court
granted
a
stay
of
these
proceedings
pending
the
petition
for
cert
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct;
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
theoretically
that
would
be
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
then,
theoretically,
the
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
but
hardly
would
the
district
court
assert
such
jurisdiction
pending
the
decision
of
the
4th
circuit.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
but
we
did
not
make
any
decision
to
withdraw
our
consent
until
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
handed
down
its
mandate,
your
honor.
i
guess
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that...
because
i
don't
think
it's
very
material
to,
really,
what
we've
got
to
get
at
here,
insofar
as
to
whether
or
not
the
4th
circuit
has
applied
the
proper
test
laid
down
by
coopers
&
lybrand
and
by
gardner,
to
see
whether
or
not
this
order
was
indeed
appealable
under
either
section
1291
or
1292(a)(1).
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
we
take
that
position,
that
that
is
one
aspect
of
withdrawal
of
consent
is
a
contractual
relationship,
and
if
we
violate
it
is
the
remedy
a
suit
for
damages
or
what?
the
law
is
not
clear
on
that
subject
at
all,
as
far
as
we
could
find
out.
but
we
contend
here
that
the
so-called
weber-type
rights
that
the
petitioners
claim
they
have
lost
by
this
denial
of
appeal
are,
after
all,
private
rights.
it's
a
voluntary,
weber-type
right,
which
was
made
between
the
unions
and
the
company,
and
that
same
right
could
be
agreed
upon
between
the
parties,
and
this
case
could
be
dismissed
agreed,
with
prejudice,
and
the
plaintiffs
would
lose
none
of
their
rights,
the
so-called
weber-type
rights.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
certainly
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
you
know--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--justice
powell
asked
what
the
provisions
of
the
consent
decree
were.
the
main
provisions
were--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--we
agreed.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
we
indeed
agreed
to
the
entry
of
the
consent
decree;
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
the
only
part
that
would
be
negated,
it
seems
to
me...
we
could
still
enter
into
a
private
agreement-like...
a
someone
pointed
out
a
little
while
ago,
many
cases
are
settled,
agreed,
and
the
cases
are
dismissed.
so
the
only
thing
that's
really
we're
lacking
here
insofar
as
the
plaintiffs
are
concerned
would
be
a
contempt
proceeding
if
the
respondents
had
indeed
violated
their
agreement.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
doesn't
necessarily
do
so
unless
one
of
the
parties
would
insist
upon
a
consent
decree
should
always
be
protected
by
a
contempt
proceedings
for
a
violation.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
heard
that
suggestion,
but
this
is
a
private
action
case.
this
is
not
the
government...
it's
not
the
eeoc
or
any
government
agency
in
this
case,
your
honor.
so
what...
i
think
the
considerations
are
a
little
different.
it's
no...
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
us
entering
into
a
contract
and--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
you'll
find
it
starting
on
page
26a,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that
is
the
agreement.
is
that
what
you
asked
me?
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
that's
all
we
have.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
no
separate
agreement,
no,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
it's
no
separate
agreement.
we
presented
this
proposed
consent
decree
jointly
at
the
last
pretrial
conference
before
trial.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
and
we
moved
for
its
adoption
at
that
time.
so
that
there,
really
is
no
separate
contract?
no
separate
agreement;
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
there's
no
obligation
on
anybody's
part,
that's
correct,
but
there's
also
nothing
to
prevent
the
parties
from
negotiating
a
different
type
of
agreement.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that
has
not
been
done.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
ah--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--well,
we
agreed
to
propose
the
consent
decree
found
in
the
appendix
to
the...
to
the
court,
justice
white.
--it's
hard
for
me
to
really
say
that
we
have
agreed
because
everybody's
looking
toward
a
consent
decree,
at
least
the
plaintiffs
were
looking
for
the
consent
decree,
and
they
appealed
the
refusal
to
enter
that
order.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
and
then
the
court
asked
us
to
file
memos
in
support
of
that
decree.
and
then--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--that's
correct.
well,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
it
was
an
oral
motion
made
at
the
final
pretrial
conference.
the
decree
was
presented
to
the
court
at
the
final
pretrial
conference
and--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--and
every
party
moved
to--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--that's
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
it
was
by
oral
motion.
we
requested
the
court
to
have
this
proposed
decree
at
the
final
pretrial
conference.
i
don't
think
you'll
find
a
formal
motion
on
that.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
the
district
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
it
seems
clear
that
this
is
not
a
final
order
under
1291
for
the...
the
court
did
make
a
collateral
determination
and
that...
it's
also
equally
clear
that
it's
not
a
final
order
under
1291
because
the
order
did
not
conclusively
determine
claims
for
injunctive
relief,
and
also
it's
clear
that
it's
not
final
under
1291
because
the
petitioner
can
have
an
effective
review
of
this
order
prior
to
and
after
final
judgment.
now,
the
same
test
seems
to
apply
as
laid
down
by
gardner
for
the
refusal
of
the
injunction
relief.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
well,
i
think
that
if
you
read
it--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
but
it's
our
position
that
under
rule
1292(a)(1)
the
test
is
whether
or
not
these
petitioners
were--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--and
if
not,
this
type
of
injunctive
relief
is
not
such
that
it's
covered
by
the
provisions
of
1292(a)(1),
and
it's
very
clear
that
if
it
had
effective
review,
number
one,
as
you
pointed
out,
they
could
ask
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
they
could
have
asked
for
that
either
before
or
after
the
refusal
of
consent
decree.
that
would
certainly
be
appealable,
the
refusal
of
that.
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
i
don't
think
it
is
usual
procedure,
but
it
shows
that...
it
shows
that
if
you
don't
ask
for
a
preliminary
injunction
you
must
not
feel
that
you
have
any
reparable
interest
to
protect,
or
to
lose,
so
to
speak.
all
i'm
saying
to
you,
justice
marshall,
is
that
under
the
test
laid
down
in
gardner,
that
is
an
avenue
open
to
the
petitioners,
and
then--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--yes,
sir,
and
it's--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--and
that's...
and
certainly
after
final
judgment
it's
reviewable,
and
effectively
reviewable,
because
if
after
trial
on
the
merits
the
petitioners
got
more
than
the
consent
decree
gave
them,
they
certainly
wouldn't
be
harmed.
and
if
they
got
less,
they
could
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
facts
entitle
them
to
more,
entitle
them
to
exactly
the
same
relief
that
the
consent
decree
gave
them,
or
even
more
than
that.
so,
they
got
effective
review
in
this
case.
and
finally,
it's
very
clear
that--
mr.
henry
t.
wickham
--well,
i'm
saying
that
to
have
effective
review,
there's
not
a
final
order
within
the
meaning
of
section
1292(a)(2),
justice
marshall.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
as
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
or
has
not
conclusively
passed
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
claim,
the
court
itself,
the
district
court
itself,
started
out
and
says,
"the
plaintiffs
have
included
a
statement
of
facts
in
their
brief
in
support
of
the
proposed
consent
decree.
"
"for
this
purpose
only
we
accept
these
facts
to
be
true.
"
now,
with
that
statement
it's
very
clear
that
the
court
below,
district
court
below
did
not
conclusively
find
against
the
plaintiffs.
and
if
you
look
at
the
plaintiffs'
brief
and
the
statement
of
facts
in
their
brief,
you'll
see
a
lot
more
facts
in
there,
a
lot
more
facts,
but
they
didn't
present
those
facts
to
the
court
below.
now,
you
read
those
facts,
and
the
respondents
are
very
bad
people,
effectual
discrimination
is
still
present
everywhere.
those
facts
could
have
been
presented
to
the
trial
court.
why
they
weren't?
i
don't
know
but
it
shows
that
the
district
court
did
not
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
their
claim
for
injunctive
relief.
thank
you,
your
honors.
