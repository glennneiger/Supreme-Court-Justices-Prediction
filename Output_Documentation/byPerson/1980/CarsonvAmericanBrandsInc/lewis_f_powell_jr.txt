mr.
dalton,
before
you
proceed
would
you
state
precisely
the
elements
of
the
injunction
as
you
perceive
them,
the
injunction
that
was
denied?
justice
jr.
prohibiting
what?
prohibiting
discrimination?
justice
jr.
well,
i
can
ask
mr.
williams
when
he
resumes
his
argument.
justice
jr.
--mr.
wickham,
was
the
request
for
the
setting
of
the
trial
date
made
before
or
after
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case?
justice
jr.
is
it
correct,
then,
mr.
wickham
to
say
that
the
consent
decree
contained
the
settlement
agreement
of
the
parties?
justice
jr.
and
you
wished
to
have
the
court
approve
it.
justice
jr.
yes,
yes.
