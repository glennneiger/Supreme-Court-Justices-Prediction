marshall
why
would
that
be?
but
normally
when
three
people
go
into
court
together
to
get
a
consent
decree,
it's
not
normal
for
one
side
to
also
ask
for
preliminary
injunction,
is
it?
is
that
the
usual
procedure?
justice
marshall
yes,
i
know,
but
you
have
to
consider
gardner
along
with
general
electric
and--
justice
marshall
--you
have
to
consider
them
together.
justice
marshall
they're
not
objecting
to
the
review,
they're
objecting
to
the
results
of
review.
justice
marshall
--what
do
you
mean
if
they
did
not
withdraw
it,
they
said
they
would.
"in
support
of
this
motion,
the
defendants
assert
that
they
do
not
now
consent
to
the
entry
of
the
proposed
agreement.
"
justice
marshall
what
does
that
mean?
justice
marshall
that
doesn't
mean
they're
withdrawing
it.
justice
marshall
if
they
want
to
withdraw,
they
withdraw.
they
don't
say
that
word.
justice
marshall
but
don't
you
usually
file
a
motion?
justice
marshall
but
this
was
a
motion
to
ask
for
a
pretrial
conference.
justice
marshall
that's
what
the
motion
is.
justice
marshall
this
isn't
a
motion
to
withdraw.
justice
marshall
this
isn't
a
motion
to
withdraw
consent.
justice
marshall
and
they
say
that
this
will
be
presented
to
the
court
at
the
pretrial
conference.
the
record
says
that.
justice
marshall
then
it
was
unnecessary
to
withdraw
the
consent.
justice
marshall
but
you
didn't
sign
this,
this
written
consent.
justice
marshall
yes,
down
at
the
bottom.
justice
marshall
are
you
attacking
the
consent
decree
on
its
merits?
justice
marshall
the
one
that
you
agreed
to?
justice
marshall
as
of
right
now
you're
not
quarreling
with
the
merits...
with
the
merits
of
it?
justice
marshall
you
did
sign
it?
justice
marshall
you
don't
want
to
go
behind
that
now,
do
you?
justice
marshall
well,
show
me
where
you
withdrew.
justice
marshall
that
you
wanted
to
withdraw
it.
justice
marshall
that's
right,
and
you
wanted
that
to
be
discussed
at
the
pretrial
conference.
was
it
discussed?
justice
marshall
well,
why
did
you
ask
to
do
it
if
you
didn't
want
to
do
it?
justice
marshall
how
do
we
stand
now?
are
you
with
the
consent
decree
or
not?
justice
marshall
you're
against
it
now?
justice
marshall
you
want
your
signature
off
of
it.
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
necessarily
would
have
had
the
right
to
withdraw
your
consent.
you
simply
said
you
wanted
to
withdraw
it
if
legally
permissible.
