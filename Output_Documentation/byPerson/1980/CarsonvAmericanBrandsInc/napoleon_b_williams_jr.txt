mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit.
the
issue
presented
for
decision
in
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
an
employment
discrimination
suit
commenced
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
42
u.s.c.
1981.
it
is
a
case
of
first
impression
for
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit
sitting
en
banc
with
circuit
judge
hall
writing
the
opinion
for
the
majority,
held
in
the
decision
of
that
court
that
the
petitioners
could
not
appeal
an
order
of
the
district
court
below
which
rejected
the
parties'
jointly
proposed
consent
decree
on
the
grounds
that
the
injunctive
provisions
of
that
decree
were
in
violation
of
title
vii,
and
on
the
grounds
that
the
enforcement
of
those
provisions
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
that
they
are
free
to
withdraw.
we
think
that
is
a
matter
of
contractual
obligation.
they
made
a
motion
in
the
district
court;
that
court
has
stayed
all
further
consideration
of
this
matter
until
a
decision
by
this
court.
your
honor,
chief
judge
haynsworth
and
circuit
judges
winter
and
butzner
dissented.
they
believe
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
appealable
under
section
1292(a)(1)
as
an
interlocutory
order
denying
an
injunction.
the
petitioners
believe
that
the
4th
circuit
made
an
error
in
holding
that
this
order
could
not
be
immediately
appealable.
in
our
brief,
petitioners
presented
two
arguments
in
support
of
the
appealability
of
the
district
court
order.
first,
we
believe
that
the
order
is
appealable
as
an
order
denying
an
injunction
under
section
1292(a)(1).
secondly,
we
believe
that
it
is
appealable
under
the
collateral
order
exception
that
this
court
announced
with
regard
to
section
1291
in
cohen
v.
beneficial
industrial
loan
company.
before
i
present
my
argument
on
the...
mr.
justice?
would
you
feel
that
it
qualifies
under
both
sections?
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor,
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
order
said
so
many
things
that
it
had
the
effect
of
deciding
some
things
on
the
merits
and
some
things
that
were
collateral
to
the
merits.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
would.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
also,
if
your
honor
would
take
a
look
at
the
decision
by
the
4th
circuit
below,
it's
quite
clear
that
one
of
the
decisions
that
the
4th
circuit
felt
was
dispositive
of
the
matter
was
the
2nd
circuit
decision
in
seigal
v.
merrick,
which
was
decided
entirely
under
section
1291.
your
honor,
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
background
to
this
case.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
once
an
appellate
court
has
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
that
the
court
has
it
can
then
reach
out
and
decide
all
other
issues
in
the
case
that
require
reversal.
your
honor,
this
suit
concerns
employment
discrimination
in
the
tobacco
industry.
this
is
an
industry
which
has
had
a
long
history
of
official
segregation
and
discrimination
with
respect
to
blacks.
the
parties
have
reached
a
proposed
consent
order
in
this
case.
this
is
an
order,
your
honor,
which
was
reached
after
long
discussions
and
after
extensive
discovery.
it
was
a
matter
that
was
reached
after
the
parties
were
quite
aware,
in
part
because
of
the
discovery,
of
the
basic
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
their
case.
the
heart
of
the
consent
decree
was
contained
in
a
series
of
provisions
which
enjoin
the
employer
and
the
unions
from
further
discriminating
against
the
plaintiffs.
moreover,
that
consent
degree
had
provisions
which
require
the
employer
and
the
unions
to
take
remedial
action
with
respect
to
changing
the
seniority
and
the
transfer
rules
so
that
those
rules
will
not
further
discriminate
against
seasonal
workers.
in
common
with
other
consent
decrees,
your
honor,
that
settlement
also
had
an
exculpatory
clause
whereby
the
respondents
could
suffer
the
injury
of
a
judgment
against
them
without
admitting
liability.
because
this
action
was
a
class
action,
it
was
necessary
to
get
approval
of
the
district
court
under
rule
23(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
parties
by
virtue
of
this
rule
went
to
the
district
court.
now,
at
this
point,
and
for
the
first
time,
your
honor,
the
parties
found
themselves
at
loggerheads
with
the
district
court
over
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
proposed
settlement.
the
district
court
by
virtue
of
its
powers
under
rule
23(e)
decided
that
the
proposed
consent
decree
with
respect
to
those
injunctive
provisions
to
which
i
referred
a
moment
ago
was
illegal,
because
those
provisions,
it
said,
violated
title
vii
and
the
enforcement
of
those
provisions
by
a
federal
court,
it
said,
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
actions
which
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
petitioners
sought
review
of
that
determination
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
decided
that
it
was
not
appealable.
they
said
it
was
not
appealable
because
that
decision
by
the
district
court
was
simply
what
it
deemed
a
step
toward
trial.
that
court
did
not
deem
the
matter
to
be
a
decision
of
the
district
court
which
passed
on
the
merits
of
the
action
commenced
by
the
plaintiff.
that
was
rather
surprising,
your
honors,
since
that
same
court
also
said
that
it
was
not
appealable,
no
matter
what
the
reasons
were
for
the
district
court
refusing
the
injunctive
decree.
now,
let
me
give
you
some
of
the
reasons
for
refusing
that
decree,
which
were
stated
by
the
district
court
in
the
opinion
that
accompanied
this
order.
first,
the
district
court
said
that
preferential
treatment
on
the
basis
of
race
was
unlawful
except
in
those
cases
where
the
defendants
had
themselves
committed
discrimination
against
those
persons
who
were
part
of
the
plaintiffs'
class.
secondly
it
said
that
since
all
of
the
seasonal
workers
were
black
any
relief
that
was
given
to
seasonal
workers
would
in
effect
be
preferential
treatment
based
upon
race
and
therefore
barred,
again,
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
also
by
title
vii.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
yes?
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
the
only
reason
for
going
into
the
merits
at
all
is
so
that
this
court
can
make
a
preliminary
assessment
as
to
whether
or
not
with
respect
to
the
argument
under
section
1292(a)
the
merits
were
touched
upon
by
the
decree,
and
also
to
see
if
the
collateral
interests
which
the
petitioners
claim
were
adversely
affected
were
separate
and
apart
from
those
merits.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
your
honor,
we
had
not
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
in
view
of
the
determination
made
by
the
district
court,
it
is
quite
clear
that
a
preliminary
injunction
would
not
and
could
not
have
been
granted,
because
that
court
found
that
there
were
no
vestiges
of
discrimination
to
be
corrected
or
remedied.
and
given
the
fact
that
it
is
necessary
with
respect
to
a
preliminary
injunction
to
establish
that
you
have
a
prima
facie
case
or
that
you
have
a
substantial
chance
of
prevailing
on
the
merits,
it
was
clear
to
the
petitioners
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
clear
to
the
district
court
as
well
that
burden
could
not
have
been
met
by
petitioners.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
a
denial
of
a
temporary
restraining
order?
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor,
but
with
respect
to
the
denial
of
the
temporary
restraining
order,
i
think
the
law
is
quite
clear
that
is
not
appealable
under
section
1292(a)(1),
although
the
denial
of
a
preliminary
injunction
is
of
course
appealable.
one
further
thing
which
the
district
court
said,
and
i
think
i
basically
mentioned
this
before,
your
honor,
is
that
despite
the
long
history
of
segregation
and
discrimination
which
had
existed
in
the
tobacco
industry,
that
there
were
no
vestiges
of
discrimination
to
be
overcome.
now,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
before
to
your
honors,
petitioners
have
two
arguments
which
they
wish
to
present
to
this
court,
one
based
on
section
1292(a)(1)
and
one
based
on
the
collateral
order
doctrine.
common
to
these
arguments
are
certain
policy
considerations
which
i
think
must
be
kept
in
mind
as
you
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
order
was
appealable.
the
first
point
which
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
there
comes
a
time
in
every
lawsuit
when
the
parties
have
to
make
a
basic
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
which
will
be
settled
or
a
case
which
will
be
litigated.
petitioners
believe
that
sound
judicial
administration
requires
that
artificial
barriers
not
be
put
in
the
place
of
parties
attempting
to
reach
settlement
in
a
case.
whether
a
settlement
can
be
reached
in
any
case,
your
honor,
is
a
function
of
many
factors.
one
factor
that
the
parties
will
always
consider
is
the
expense
of
further
litigation,
especially
the
expense
of
further
litigation
in
relationship
to
the
expenses
which
have
already
been
incurred.
another
factor...
and
this
is
a
factor,
we
think,
your
honor,
which
is
quite
important
in
racial
discrimination
cases
and
in
labor
management
cases,
and
that
is
the
desirability
which
the
parties
have
to
keep
down
forces
of
civil
strife
in
the
workplace.
we
think,
your
honor,
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
endorsed
the
idea
that
voluntary
settlement
and
cooperation
should
be
preferred
means
of
resolving,
racial
discrimination
cases
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
a
third
factor
which
affects
settlement
possibilities
would
be
the
parties'
assessment
of
their
chances
of
winning
or
losing
a
lawsuit.
now,
this
is
an
assessment,
your
honor,
which
will
of
course
depend
upon
the
time.
the
further
a
lawsuit
progresses,
the
more
likely
the
parties
will
tend
to
reach
a
different
assessment
as
to
their
chances
of
prevailing,
and
therefore
the
terms
of
a
settlement
will
vary
with
the
progress
of
time.
therefore,
your
honor,
in
a
case
like
this,
if
the
parties
are
denied
the
settlement
that
they
themselves
want
and
are
forced
to
litigate
further
then
the
parties
are
being
put
in
a
position
whereby
they
may
never
be
able
to
retrieve
the
opportunity
which
they
once
had.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
light
of
your
past
decisions,
it
is
quite
clear
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
has
decided
that
piecemeal
adjudication
is
bad
is
because
of
the
expense
and
the
time
that
it
consumes,
and
also
the
cost
to
the
parties
and
the
court
and
the
public
interest
as
a
whole.
and
here
one
of
the
factors
we're
considering
is
the
question
of
cost
and
the
question
of
time
and
expense.
so,
in
this
particular
instance,
your
honor,
i
think
that
where
you
have
parties
who
do
not
themselves
want
to
litigate
and
who
are
trying
not
to
litigate,
that
to
give
them
the
opportunity
not
to
litigate
is
the
policy
that
best
furthers
the
policies
behind
the
avoidance
of
piecemeal
litigation.
if
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
district
court
erects
a
legal
barrier
to
the
parties'
ability
to
settle
the
case,
that
matter
should
be
reviewed,
we
believe,
by
an
appellate
court
so
that
the
parties
can
determine
if
they
can
or
should
not
go
further.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
exactly
the
case
here.
if
an
appeal
were
allowed
and
if
this
case
were
decided
favorably
to
the
petitioners,
that
would
be
an
end
to
this
litigation.
any
other
course,
we
think,
would
result
in
litigation
for
at
least
the
next
two
or
three
years.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
the
parties
would
have
suffered
in
that
particular
case
would
have
been
a
certain
amount
of
delay
if
it
comes
out
adversely,
in
this
case,
for
example,
to
the
petitioners.
but
here
you
have
parties
who
have
been
willing,
certainly
up
until
now,
to
settle
their
claim,
so
that
if
it
were
determined
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
its
ascertainment
of
the
legal
principles
that
govern
decision
in
this
case,
then
that
would
have
helped
the
parties
to
have
resolved
this
matter
prior
to
the
matter
coming
to
this
court.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
no,
we
don't
think
the
argument
leads
to
that
conclusion,
your
honor.
we
think
that
it's,
for
the
reason
that
was
indicated
in
goldstein
v.
cox.
goldstein
points
out
that
your
decision
in
switzerland
cheese
was
not
an
order
denying
an
injunction
because
the
decision
in
that
case
turned
upon
an
assessment
of
the
facts,
not
on
a
determination
of
the
legal
principles.
where
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
made
and
it
is
denied
as
a
matter
of
law,
then
goldstein
v.
cox
makes
it
clear
that
is
for
this
court
an
open
question.
but
also,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
it's
clear
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
reached
the
merits.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
further
discussion
five
minutes
of
rebuttal
time.
my
white
light
is
on,
my
time
is
concluded.
thank
you.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
it
would
not
be
appealable,
your
honor.
that
would
simply
be
a
step
towards
further
litigation
of
the
case,
and
also
it
would
not
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
minutes
your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
case
is
moot.
the
case
is
most
only
if
the
denial
of
the
proposed
consent
decree
is
not
appealable.
but
that
is
the
very
question
that
we
have
been
trying
to
seek
review.
your
honor,
one
of
the
advices
which--
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
--the
consent
decree--
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
--but
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
matter,
your
honor.
that
would
be
the--
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
--well,
that's
the
submission,
your
honor,
but
that's
no
basis
in
fact--
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
--well,
we
believe
that
whether
or
not
one
can
withdraw
from
a
proposed
consent
decree
would
depend
upon
elements
of
basic
contract
law,
as
well
as
upon
the
principles
set
forth
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that's
manifested
by
the
conduct
of
the
parties,
and
we
think
that's
manifested
by
their
written
signatures
to
the
agreement
that
was
being
moved
for
the
court
to
accept.
but,
your
honor,
one
of
the
things
that
i
want
to
point
cut
with
respect
to
allowing
a
district
court
to
make
a
legal
determination
as
to
what
is
allowable
or
not
allowable
without
giving
the
power
of
review
with
respect
to
that
determination,
is
that
in
effect
it
does
affect
the
parties'
agreement
to
come
to
terms
even
out
of
court.
were
the
parties
in
this
case
to
try
to
enter
into
an
agreement
that
would
basically
achieve
the
same
thing
as
this
proposed
consent
decree,
then
the
parties
would
find
that
with
respect
to
third
parties,
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
the
legality
of
what
they
were
doing
because
of
noncompliance
with
rule
23(e).
two,
they
would
find
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
could
be
used
as
a
basis
to
collaterally
attack
the
validity
of
that
out-of-court
agreement
which
they
were
then
trying
to
voluntarily
comply
with.
your
honor,
we
think
that
a
consent
decree
is
needed
in
addition
to
any
type
of
agreement
that
the
parties
might
reach
voluntarily
in
a
case
like
this,
in
part
because
of
the
need,
as
this
court
found
in
united
steelworkers
of
america
v.
weber,
to
decide
the
rights
of
third
parties.
secondly,
we
think
that
it
is
needed
because
of
the
need
for
enforcement
with
respect
to
those
kinds
of
mandatory
things
that
the
parties
are
supposed
to
do
or
not
to
do.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
did
decide
the
rights
of
third
parties
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
that
agreement.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
mr.
napoleon
b.
williams,
jr.
yes,
it
did
involve
some
notice,
but
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
those
provisions
are
adequate,
your
honor.
but
we
don't
think
that
that
would
affect
the
parties'
ability
to
settle
the
case
as
such.
so,
thank
you.
