mr.
jay
j.
levit
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court:
the
reason
the
unions
didn't
make
a
formal
motion
to
withdraw
their
consent
was
because
it
obviously
wasn't
necessary.
the
district
court
judge
had
refused
to
enter
the
consent
decree.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
i'm
talking,
your
honor,
with
respect...
when
the
case
was
remanded
from
the
4th
circuit
back
to
the
district
court
judge,
and
then
at
the
time
that
a
pretrial
conference
was
requested
by
the
respondents,
in
that
motion
requesting
a
pretrial
conference,
the
respondents
stated
that
they
withdrew
their
consent.
they
said
nothing
more
except
to
say
that
they
withdrew
their
consent.
and
at
some
time
during
the
discussion
between
the
court
and
counsel
the
question
was
raised
by
one
of
the
justices,
were
any
formal
grounds
for
withdrawal
of
consent
set
out?
and
i
felt
that
it
would
be--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
that
means
that
the
consent--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--oh,
i
would
submit,
your
honor--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--well,
they
do
say,
your
honor;
that
they
no
longer
consent,
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that's
the
same
thing
as
withdrawing
your
consent.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
oh,
this
was
in
a
motion.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
it's
a
statement--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--well,
your
honor,
the
reason--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--there
was
no
need
for
a
motion,
your
honor.
the
reason
there
wasn't
a
need
for
a
formal
motion
to
withdraw
consent
is
because
the
district
court
judge
had
refused
to
enter
the
consent
decree,
so
it
was
unnecessary
to
move
him
to
do
what
he
had
already
done.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
we
wanted
to,
make
it
a
matter
of
record
that
the
consent
didn't
exist.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
no,
i
signed
it,
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
page
67.
no,
68a.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
we
did
sign
it,
your
honor,
the
unions
did
sign
that.
and
we
joined
in
that
motion.
but
we
felt,
at
least
it
was
our
position,
that
no
formal
withdrawal
was
necessary
for
those
reasons.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
we
made
a...
well,
at
the
time
that
the
consent
decree
was
proposed
to
the
district
court,
there
were
supporting
memoranda
filed
by
the
parties
in
support
of
the
entry
of
the
decree,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
i
believe
it
was
posed
when
we
presented
it
to
the
district
court.
we
stated
that
we
had
a
consent
decree
form
and
i
believe
counsel
wrote
the
district
court
a
letter
indicating
that
a
consent
decree
would
be
forth-coming
to
the
court,
that
the
parties
were
proposing
to
the
court.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
the
two
things
occurred
in
such--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--such
distant
points
of
time,
your
honor.
that's
the
time
that
the
district...
the
consent
decree
was
presented
and
the
time
that
it
went...
and
the
appeal
time,
and
the
remand
back,
was
a
couple
of
years,
and
of
course,
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
mention
was
that
the
evils
of
piecemeal
litigation
certainly
involve
the
appellate
court
getting
involved
in
the
trial
process.
now,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
distinguished
the
court's
decision
in
switzerland
cheese
on
the
ground
that
that
was
just
a
denial
of
motion
for
summary
judgment,
that
there
were
material
issues
of
fact.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
we
may
have
and
do
have
basically
the
same
thing
here.
if
you
look
at
the
proposed
consent
decree,
you'll
see
recitations
in
there
where
it's
recited
that
the
district
court
judge
has
reviewed
the
extensive
discovery,
and
there
was
extensive
discovery
in
this
case.
there
were
numerous
depositions
and
extensive
written
interrogatories,
and
production
of
documents.
and
it
recites
that
the
district
court
has
reviewed
the
discovery
in
this
case.
so,
the
district
court
in
denying
entry
of
a
consent
decree
may
very
well
have
done
so
for
principles
and
on
standards
which
would
be
quite
similar
in
denying
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
in
that
respect--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--i
think
that
the
reasons
that
he
gave
would
very
well
encompass
precisely
what
i'm
presenting
to
you
that
he
felt
that
it
was
improper
for
several
reasons
that
he
stated
but
there's
no
question
that
he
did
review
the
record,
that
he
did
review
the
extensive
discovery
involved
in
the
case.
and
for
the
appellate
court
to
take
that
prerogative
away
from
him
when
he
may
feel
that
there's
a
material
issue
of
fact...
and
i
think
it's
apparent
that
he
did
feel
that.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
point
is
that
the
appellate
court
would
have
to
get
involved
in
the
trial
process,
and
the
appellate
court
obviously
didn't
go
through
the
discovery.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
i
don't
think
the
appellate
court
reviewed
the
discovery
in
this
case.
and
that's
the
point
that
we're
trying
to
make,
is
that
the
appellate
court
did
not
review
the
discovery
in
this
case
the
way
the
district
court
judge
did,
and
that's
why
the
appellate
court
would
not
properly
get
involved
in
the
trial
process
here.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
your
honor--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--i
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
so,
your
honor,
because
we
can't
ignore
the
terms
of
the
proposed
consent
decree.
and
right
at
the
outset
of
the
proposed
consent
decree
the
parties
state
that
they
want
to
avoid
the
time
and
expense
of
litigation.
and
perhaps
even
more
than
the
expense
of
litigation
in
this
case
is
the
time.
after
all,
the
union
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
administer
and
the
company
has
a
business
to
run,
and
when
these
parties
entered
into
this
proposed
consent
decree
it
was
with
the
anticipation
it
would
be
entered
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
and
it
may
very
well,
from
the
union's
point
of
view
as
a
collective
bargaining
contract
administrator
result
in
utter
chaos.
time
may
be
very,
very
much
more
important
than
expense
here,
for--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--but
also,
your
honor,
it
goes
very
much
to
the
merits
of
the
proposed
decree
itself,
because
the
parties
weren't
getting
what
they
bargained
for.
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
a
bargain,
the
parties
are
not
getting
what
they
bargained
for,
and
what
they
expressly
bargained
for,
right
at
the
outset
of
the--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--i'm
saying
that
the--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--the
one
that
we
agreed
to
we
would
have
been
happy
with
if
it
had
been
promptly
entered.
but
what
we
anticipate--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--we're
not...
what
we're
saying
now
is--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--yes,
we
did.
there's
no
question
about
that.
yes
we
did.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
we
have
withdrawn
our
consent
to
it.
we
feel
that
we
have
a
basic
right
to
do
so.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
we
withdrew
when
we
stated
in
the
motion
to
the--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--that
we
no
longer
consented.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
there
was
no
need
to
discuss
it.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
because
we
wanted
to
make
it
a
matter
of
record
that
our
consent
no
longer
existed
on
that
document.
we
didn't
feel
that
we
needed
to
set
forth
formal
grounds
or
make
a
motion
to
have
it
withdrawn
because
the
judge
had
already
refused
to
enter
it,
and
we
felt
it
wasn't
necessary
under
the
circumstances
to
do
it.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
we
don't--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--yes.
that
doesn't
mean
that--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--that's
correct.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
well,
i
think
it
does.
because
i
think
that
it's...
if
there
is
no--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--but
if
there
is...
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
if
there
is
no
existing
consent
decree,
then--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--but
if
there
isn't
one
now--
mr.
jay
j.
levit
--if
there
isn't
one
now,
it's
an
exercise
in
futility.
mr.
jay
j.
levit
absolutely.
it
has
become
moot.
there
is
no
case
or
controversy,
is
our
position.
