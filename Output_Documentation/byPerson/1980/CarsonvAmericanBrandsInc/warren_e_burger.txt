we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
79-1236,
carson
et
al.
v.
american
brands,
inc..
mr.
williams,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
williams,
i
get
some
impression
from
the
papers
that
the
respondents
may
have
a
different
view
about
going
ahead
with
the
consent
decree.
whenever
you
wish,
would
you
comment
on
whether
that
is
the
fact,
if
you
know
it,
and
if
so,
are
they
free
to
withdraw?
and
of
course
your
friend
will
tell
us
something
about
that
too,
perhaps.
chief
justice
burger
which
way,
mr.
williams,
do
you
think
the
negative
aspects
of
piecemeal
appeals
cuts
in
this
case?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
not
generally
true
that
on
the
problem
of
piecemeal
appeals
that
one
of
the
propositions
is
that
if
it
comes
out
one
way,
it
will
terminate
the
litigation,
and
if
it
comes
out
the
other
way,
it
does
not?
isn't
that
always
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dalton.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
any
reason
why
the
parties
could
not
abide
all
the
terms
of
the
consent
decree
if
they
were
in
the
posture
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
abide
those
conditions
voluntarily
even
if
a
district
judge
would
not
accept
the
decree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
dalton.
mr.
wickham.
chief
justice
burger
what
is
held
up
by
the
district
court's
action,
except
its
proceeding
with
the
trial?
is
that
what
you're
referring
to,
that
the
trial
cannot
proceed
in
the
district
court
now?
chief
justice
burger
at
some
point
would
you
comment
on
whether
your
client
wishes
to
withdraw
and
if
so
whether
you
may
withdraw
or
whether
you're
bound
by
some
contractual
consideration?
chief
justice
burger
what
jurisdiction
did
the
district
court
have
after
a
notice
of
appeal
was
filed?
chief
justice
burger
once
the
notice
of
appeal
had
been
filed,
the
district
court
could
not
address
itself
to
the
question
whether
you
have
the
authority--
chief
justice
burger
--or
the
power
to
withdraw
your
consent.
chief
justice
burger
was
that
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
burger
but
in
the
interim,
between
the
time
the
district
court
acted
initially
and
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
acted,
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
was
there?
chief
justice
burger
--i
understand
that
second
point.
you
won't
know
that
for
some
little
time
yet,
will
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levit.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
union
did
not
want
to
undermine
the
consent
decree.
why
would
they
make
a--
chief
justice

e.
burger
mr.
williams,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
brennan
has
two
opinions
to
announce
for
the
court.
