justice
stevens
in
that
motion,
although
it
wasn't
a
motion
to
withdraw
your
consent,
did
you
allege
a
right
to
withdraw
or
take
the
position
you
had
a
right
to
withdraw
by
reason
of
changed
circumstances,
or
you
just
changed
your
mind
about?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
see.
a
motion,
a
post-decree
motion,
but
we
would
still
have
the
problem
here
of
whether
refusal
to
enter
the
decree
was
to
refuse
that
or
an
injunction--
justice
stevens
mr.
wickham,
i
don't
understand.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
holding
the
order
was
not
appealable,
i
don't
why
a
notice
of
appeal
would
deprive
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction,
because
the
notice
of
appeal
would
be
a
nullity.
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
that
the
issue
we're
called
upon
to
decide
today?
if
the
appeal
was
improper--
justice
stevens
--if
it
was
an
improper
appeal,
then
the
appeal
didn't
have
any
effect
on
the
district
court--
justice
stevens
but
mr.
levit,
didn't
he
tell
us
why
he
did
so?
didn't
he
give
his
reasons?
weren't
his
reasons
legal
reasons
rather
than
the
reasons
you
now
describe?
justice
stevens
well,
but
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
whether
he
acted
properly
in
refusing
to
enter
the
decree,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stevens
anytime
you
review
a
complicated
matter
you
have
to
look
at
the
record.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
point
that
two
years
went
by
after
you
made
your
motion,
and
so
that
you
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
allege
changed
circumstances...
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
order
was
appealable
and
sent
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
should
hold
that
the
district
court
committed
error
in
refusing
to
enter
the
decree,
i
suppose
it
would
have
the
power
to
reverse
and
say
the
decree
should
have
been
entered.
and
therefore
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
allege
some
kind
of
post-decree
events
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
bargain.
justice
stevens
but
i
suppose
the
review
will
take
place
as
of
the
date
that
the
district
judge
acted,
and
he
either
committed
error
on
that
date
or
he
acted
properly,
one
of
the
two.
justice
stevens
well,
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
whether
the
district
judge
should
be
affirmed
or
reversed,
rather
than
to
whether
anything's
appealable.
justice
stevens
mr.
williams,
before
you
sit
down,
maybe
it's
in
the
papers,
but
i
did
want
to
clear
up
one
thing
about
the
procedure.
the
proposed
decree
purports,
as
i
understand
it,
to
get
rid
of
all
damages...
for
all
members
of
the
class.
did
the
procedure
that
was
contemplated
involve
notice
to
the
class?
