justice
rehnquist
before
you
do
that,
counsel,
since
as
i
understand
the
cohen
doctrine
it
has
to
be
not
related
to
the
merits,
if
you
were
successful
in
appealing
this
order
under
the
cohen
doctrine,
could
you
appeal
that
part
that
related
to
the
merits,
too.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
williams?
justice
rehnquist
the
merits
aren't
before
us,
are
they?
justice
rehnquist
just
the
appealability,
whether
the
district
court
was
right
or
wrong
in
what
he
said
about
the
propriety
of
the
decree.
justice
rehnquist
had
you
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
a
denial
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
appealable?
justice
rehnquist
did
you
ask
for
ex
parte
pending
a
hearing
on
a
request
for
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
rehnquist
could
i
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
williams?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
district
court
had
said
there
is
now
pending
in
the
4th
circuit
a
case
which
will
decide
the
legality
of
this
consent
order
and
i
think
it
will
be
decided
in
about
three
or
four
months
so
i'm
going
to
withhold
my
consent
until
the
4th
circuit
hands
down
its
opinion.
would
you
say
that
sort
of
a
refusal
to
enter
a
consent
decree
by
the
district
court
may
allow
you
to
appeal?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
dalton,
you
don't
suggest
that
eeoc
or
title
vii
actions
are
governed
by
different
rules
of
appealability
than
are
set
forth
in
1291
or
1292?
justice
rehnquist
it
the
district
court
was
deprived
of
jurisdiction
and
in
fact
the
order...
then
it
must
be
because
there
was
a
right
to
appeal,
and
if
it
retained
jurisdiction,
it
must
be
because
the
appeal
was
improper
and
it
just
chose
to
await
the
outcome
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
rehnquist
if
you
didn't
withdraw
your
consent,
wouldn't
the
agreement
that
you
entered
into
be
enforceable
as
a
private
contract?
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
could
in
fact
sue
you
on
the
contract,
i
take
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
yet
that
part
of
the
obligation,
because
of
rule
23,
can
be
negated
by
the
trial
judge
if
he
refuses
to
approve
it,
i
suppose.
justice
rehnquist
but
if
you
entered
a
25-paragraph
settlement
agreement
and
one
of
the
paragraphs
says,
we
will
enter
a
consent
decree,
and
the
district
court
rejects
the
consent
decree,
that
doesn't
necessarily
void
the
other
24
paragraphs
of
the
agreement
that
you've
entered
into
voluntarily.
