did
you
argue
the
cohen
matter
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
i
suppose
part
of
your
argument
is
that
if
you
allow
an
appeal
you
avoid
piecemeal
litigation,
because
if
the
appeal
comes
out
a
certain
way
the
case
is
over.
justice
white
but,
you're
making
more
of
a
cohen's
argument
now
than
anything,
i
take
it,
and
this
kind
of
an
argument
would
lead
you
to
say
that
any
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
would
be
appealable;
because
if
that
denial
is
reversed,
the
case
is
over.
justice
white
mr.
dalton,
i
take
it
that
under
your
argument
and
that
of
your
colleague,
that
the
denial
of
the
consent
decree
would
be
appealable
by
either
party?
justice
white
or
both?
justice
white
and
does
that
cause
you
any
kind
of
problem?
justice
white
they'd
both
be
taking
the
same
position?
justice
white
i
would
suppose
that
in
some
cases
it
might
be
the
other
side
that
would
be
most
eager
to
have
the
consent
decree
entered?
justice
white
most
times
they
do,
in
private
litigation.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
the
contract
has
a
clause
in
it
whereby
your
clients
agree
to
the
entry
of
a
consent
decree?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
the
government
suggests
that
it
wouldn't
enter
into
any
settlements
except
in
connection
with
a
consent
degree.
justice
white
is
the
consent
decree...
is
the
agreement
in
the
record?
justice
white
it
isn't
in
the
printed
record,
is
it?
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
all
right.
i
had
looked
for
that;
i
didn't
find
it.
thank
you
very
much.
that's
just
the
consent
decree
on--
justice
white
so
there
would
be
nothing...
if
the
judge
refuses
to
enter,
the
decree,
the
motions
are
just
denied
and
there
is
no
obligation
on
anybody's
part
from
there
on,
of
any
kind.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
hasn't
been
done.
justice
white
--are
the
motions
in
the
printed
record?
but
i
suppose
they're
in
the
record
of
trial
here.
justice
white
--was
that
by
oral
motion
or
by
agreement?
justice
white
well,
the
proposed
decree
here,
the
first
paragraph,
is
that,
your
client
agrees
that...
and
a
permanent
injunction
entered
against
them
enjoining
discrimination,
and
then,
paragraph
3,
it
provides
for
further
injunctive
relief,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
you
certainly...
if
you
didn't
live
up
to
this
decree
which
contained
an
injunction,
you
would
be
subject
to
contempt.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
well,
there
never
was
any
problem
about
withdrawing
consent.
actually,
you
filed
a
motion,
or
you'd
made
an
oral
motion
to
enter
the
decree?
justice
white
but
there...
was
there
an
oral
motion,
was
there?
or
was
it--
justice
white
--well,
you
really...
what
you're
really
saying,
that
you
withdraw...
you're
interested
in
withdrawing
your
motion
that
the
consent
decree
be
entered.
justice
white
but
your
motion
was
denied?
justice
white
--suppose
the
consent
decree
had
said,
until
this
case
becomes
final
either
party
may
withdraw
from
it.
suppose
it
said
that
and
while
the
case
was
on
appeal
one
of
the
parties
withdraws?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
what's
so
different.
the
submission
is
that
either
party
was
free
to
withdraw
and
that
one
of
them
has
withdrawn.
that's
the
submission.
justice
white
what
do
you
disagree
with
in
that
submission?
justice
white
where
do
you
find
the
agreement
that
the
consent
decree
be
entered?
