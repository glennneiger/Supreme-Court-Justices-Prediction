isn't
it?
justice
stewart
all
i
want
to
know
is--
justice
stewart
--about
the
one
provision.
didn't
you
agree
to
the
entry
of
the
consent
decree?
justice
stewart
and
so
that
is
part
of
your
contractual
obligation?
justice
stewart
every
party
moved
for--
justice
stewart
--that
must
have
been
by
agreement,
via--
justice
stewart
well,
really
none
of
this
goes
to
the
issues
before
us,
which
is
the
appealability
of
the
denial
of
the
entry
of
the
decree.
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
what
happened
two
years
later
is
really
not...
it
hardly
bears
on
that
issue,
does
it?
justice
stewart
there
was
at
the
time
that
it
was
appealed.
justice
stewart
it's
not
being
appealed.
justice
stewart
so
you're
really,
your
argument
is
really
that
the
case
has
become
moot?
justice
stewart
the
weber
case
didn't
involve
any
consent
decree,
that
was
simply
an
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
labor
union.
