mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
more
often
than
not
title
vii
suits
brought
by
the
government
end
up
in
consent
decrees,
thus
encouraging
voluntary
compliance
and
maximizing
limited
federal
law
enforcement
resources.
indeed,
before
even
commencing
lawsuits,
the
justice
department
typically
contacts
potential
defendants
and
invites
them
to
sit
down
and
discuss
settlement,
and
advises
them
that
should
settlement
be
reached,
that
agreement
must
be
memorialized
in
a
consent
decree.
thus
to
the
extent
that
the
government
is
forced
to
try
cases
which
but
for
the
district
court's
unreasoned
objection
would
result
in
a
settlement
that's
fair
to
the
defendants
and
that
advances
the
rights
of
the
parties,
our
ability
to
vigorously
enforce
title
vii
and
related
statutes
is
seriously
undermined.
now,
we
submit
that
this
is
appealed
from...
is
appealed
both
as
an
order
refusing
an
injunction
and
as
a
collateral
order.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no,
not
at
all.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
special
rule
relating
to
title
vii.
but
our
peculiar
interest
in
the
case
results
from
our
experience
under
title
vii.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
my
understanding
is
that
there
is
a
general
element
of
prohibiting
discrimination
in
the
future,
that
there
were--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--yes.
that
there
are
mandatory
features
of
the
injunction.
for
example,
the
requirement
that
supervisory...
that
hereinafter
blacks
be
hired
into
supervisory
positions
until
one-third
of
the
supervisors
are
blacks.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
i
can
do
it
but
it's
going
to
stretch
me
a
bit.
common
to
all
appealability
theories,
in
our
view,
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
order
at
issue
is
reviewable
following
final
judgment.
as
my
brother
mr.
williams
indicated,
settlements
are
based
upon
the
parties'
assessment
of
the
strength
and
weaknesses
of
their
own
cases,
their
assessment
of
the
facts
that
the
court
is
likely
to
find
credible.
after
the
evidence
is
in,
those
perceptions
change.
indeed,
they're
replaced
by
knowledge
of
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
cases,
of
the
parties'
respective
cases,
by
knowledge
of
what
aspects
of
your...
what
vulnerabilities
in
your
own
case
have
managed
to
escape
detection.
and
once
the
final
judgment
is
in,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
court
of
appeals
can
never
return
to
the
state
of
facts
or
perceptions
that
existed
at
the
time
the
consent
decree
was
entered
into.
because
if
the
litigated
judgment
is
not
defective
for
reasons
under
it,
in
order
to
return
to
the
settlement
proposal
that
arguably
was
improperly
rejected
by
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
would
in
essence
have
to
base
its
reversal
on
facts
other
than
those
proved
at
trial,
and
on
merits
other
than
those,
if
they
appear
following
a
fully
litigated
case.
nor
can
prejudgment
review
be
presumed
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
there's
no
parallel
in
this
kind
of
situation
to
rule
23(c)(1)
in
the
class
action
context
where
the
rule
invites
the
court
to
periodically
reconsider
the
propriety
of
the
class.
certainly
a
refusal
of
a
consent
decree
is
final
as
to
the
terms
in
that
particular
consent
decree.
moreover,
the
notion
that
the
court
of
appeals
touched
upon
of
reconsideration
of
the
consent
decree,
in
this
case
by
the
district
court,
is
meaningless
in
cases
such
as
this
one,
and
such
as
the
city
of
alexandria
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
in
which
the
district
court
premised
their
refusal
to
enter
the
decree
on
their
view
that
the
decree
itself
has
unlawful
provisions
and
has
no
basis
in
fact,
because
there's
no
admission
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
even
in
a
case
where
the
court
premises
its
refusal
to
enter
the
decree
on
more
equitable
kinds
of
considerations
rather
than
legal,
reconsideration...
the
possibility
that
order
may
be
reconsidered
at
some
point
by
the
district
court
is
not
an
appropriate
basis
for
denying
appealability.
for
example,
the
case
of
santana
v.
collazo,
a
case
that
began
in
the
district
court
of
puerto
rico
and
that
ultimately
wound
up
in
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals,
index
no.
79-1531,
the
private
plaintiffs
and
the
justice
department
as
intervenors
on
their
side
submitted
three
successive,
entered
into
three
successive
consent
decrees
with
their
adversaries,
who
were
the
authorities
in
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
responsible
for
the
juvenile
justice
system.
on
each
occasion...
the
first
occasion
was
the
district
court
asked
the
parties
to
make
certain
modifications
in
the
consent
decree.
the
parties
returned
to
the
table,
made
modifications,
and
in
each
instance
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
consent
decree.
so
even
where
the
court
ostensibly
is
not
basing
its
rejection
on
a
view
of
the
scope
of
title
vii,
this
motion
for
reconsideration
is
not
the
boon
that
one
would
guess
from
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--oh,
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
there
may
be
difficulties,
as
indeed
there
were
in
this
case,
where
no
one
wants
to...
well,
in
this
case
what
happened
was
that
the
plaintiffs
sought
to
appeal
the
denial
of
the
consent
decree
and
the
respondent
defendants
wanted
to
take
no
position
on
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
because
they
felt
there
were
not
in
an
adversary
posture.
courts
have
tried
various
means
of
dealing
with
that
problem.
some
courts
have
invited
the
u.s.
attorney
to
file
a
brief.
others
have
appointed
counsel
for
purposes
of
the
appeal
to
take
the
other
side.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
indeed,
indeed.
as
this
court
said
in
weber,
there
are
often
business
reasons
why
employers
very
much
want
to
enter
into
consent
decrees.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
it
is
certain
it's
true
that
parties
can
enter
into
private
settlements
of
lawsuits
and
any
time
a
party--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--indeed.
and
it
is
certainly
true
that
when
parties
come
to
the
point
where
they
are
willing
to
agree
to
terms
of
a
settlement,
they
are
much
more
inclined
to
abide
by
them
voluntarily
than
not.
however,
the
justice
department
routinely
enters
into
consent
decrees
because
they
are
enforceable
by,
among
other
sanctions,
contempt,
and
because
in
the
event
of
changed
circumstances
it's
often
much
more
useful
to
put
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
agreement
should
be
modified
or
indeed
dissolved
to
an
impartial
judicial
tribunal
rather
than
to
parties.
so
while
it
is
certainly
possible
that
parties
could
enter
into
a
private
agreement,
consent
decree
is
in
the
judgment
of
the
government
a
much
more
useful
device
all
around,
from
the
standpoint
of
all
the
parties
and
the
court.
i'd
like
to
touch
upon
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
question
about
which
way
the
evils
of
piecemeal
adjudication
cut.
i
agree
with
my
brother
that
the
general
notion
that
interlocutory
appeals
slow
down
the
trial
process
is
not
in
this
context
a
terribly
useful
sense.
what
the
parties
are
trying
to
do
in
a
consent
decree
is
to
end
the
litigation.
it's
true,
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out,
that
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
summary
judgment
motion.
but
what's
left
after
a
summary
judgment
motion
even
if
a
denial
is
upheld
on
appeal
are
only
those
issues
as
to
which
there
is
legitimate
dispute,
so
that
even
though
there
may
be
a
trial
afterward
it's
a
very
truncated
trial,
and
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
full
trial
on
the
merits.
moreover,
there
are
other
independent
reasons
why
this
court
unanimously
concluded,
i
think
correctly,
that
a
refusal
to
enter
a
summary
judgment
motion
is
not
appealable,
and
those
factors
are
not
present
here.
moreover,
i
don't
think
that
the
floodgate
of
litigation
feared
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
appropriate,
is
on
balance
a
reasonable
fear,
when
we're
talking
about
refusals
to
enter
consent
decrees.
to
the
extent
that
other
reasonable
alternative
decrees
are
available,
it
seems
to
me
it's
in
the
parties'
perceived
interests
to
search
out
and
reach
for
those
agreements.
the
very
factors
that
led
the
parties
enter
a
settlement
in
the
first
place
that
mr.
williams
outlined
and
the
desire
to
avoid
the
expense
and
delay
of
litigation
would
lead
them
to
reach
other
reasonable
agreements.
the
kinds
of
cases
that
would
result
in
an
appeal
are
precisely
like
those
at
bar
where
the
court's
refusal
to
enter
the
decree
is
based
upon
a
misapprehension
of
the
scope
of
the
statute
or
if
the
requirements
of
the
law.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
