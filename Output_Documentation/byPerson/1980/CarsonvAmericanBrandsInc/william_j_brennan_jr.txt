the
first,
79-1236,
carson
versus
american
brands,
inc.
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it's
a
class
action
under
42
u.s.c.
1981
and
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
to
remedy
alleged
discrimination
in
hiring,
promotion,
transfer,
and
training
opportunities
on
racial
grounds.
the
parties
to
this
suit
arrived
at
a
settlement
agreement
that
would
have
required
the
respondent
employer
to
give
hiring
and
seniority
preferences
to
black
employees
and
would
have
permanently
enjoined
the
respondents
from
discrimination
against
black
employees.
and
the
parties
after
reaching
the
agreement
jointly
moved
the
district
court
to
approve
and
under
their
proposed
consent
decree.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
petitioners
then
sought
to
appeal
the
denial
embodied
in
an
interlocutory
order
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
court
sitting
en
banc
dismissed
the
appeal
for
want
of
the
jurisdiction
holding
that
the
refusal
of
the
district
court
to
enter
the
consent
decree
was
neither
an
appealable
collateral
order
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1291
nor
an
appealable
interlocutory
order
refusing
an
injunction
under
28
u.s.c.
1292
(a)
(1).
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
we
unanimously
hold
that
the
order
denying
the
motion
to
enter
the
consent
decree
was
an
interlocutory
order
refusing
an
injunction
under
1292
(a)
(1).
we
accordingly
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
without
reaching
the
question
whether
the
order
was
also
appealable
under
28
u.s.c.
1291.
