it
would
be
a
new
trial?
justice
stevens
but
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
conclude
that
the
state
courts
do
have
jurisdiction,
might
it
not
also
follow
that
the
state
courts
can
apply
their
own
rules
of
damages?
and
in
which
event
they
might
not
have
to
give
the
liepelt
instruction?
justice
stevens
is
there
a
federal
measure
of
damages
in
things
like
mental
suffering
and
loss
of
consortium
and
all
that?
is
there
a
federal--
--no,
but
there
is
about
taxes.
justice
stevens
no,
but,
you
know,
some
of
these
like
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
all,
there
have
been
different
rules
of
damages
with
the
state
or
federal--
justice
stevens
--so
there's
no
federal
rule
of
damages
applicable
with
respect
to
just
the
measure
of
damages,
putting
aside
taxation
for
the
moment?
