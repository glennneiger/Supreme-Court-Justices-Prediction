justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
'53
act
was
primarily
thought
of
in
terms
of
personal
injury
jurisdiction?
justice
rehnquist
you're
paraphrasing
now
from
pages
3
and
4
of
your
brief?
justice
rehnquist
i
was
just
going
to
say,
it's
on
page
three
of
your
brief,
section
b
of
the
statute
says
the
united
states
district
courts
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
cases
and
controversies.
it
does
not
say
original
and
exclusive,
and
certainly
in
fela
cases
and
in
1983
cases
the
federal
courts
are
the
primary
fora
but
nonetheless
state
courts
can
entertain
1983
actions
and
it's
my
understanding
that
state
courts
can
entertain
fela
actions.
justice
rehnquist
in
our
own
article
iii
jurisdiction,
as
you
no
doubt
know,
the
provision
is,
with
respect
to
some
kinds
of
cases
our
jurisdiction
is
original
and
exclusive,
and
with
respect
to
others
it's
just
original
but
not
exclusive.
justice
rehnquist
a
state
court
is
generally
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
and
if
one
party
from
venezuela
sues
another
party
from
holland
over
an
accident
that
happened
500
miles
out
at
sea,
unless
there
is
some
federal
prohibition
or
statutory
enactment
prohibiting
it,
the
federal
court
can
take
jurisdiction
or
the
state
court
can
take
jurisdiction
of
that,
can't
it?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
bremen
v.
zapata?
justice
rehnquist
but
it
says,
"the
provisions
of
this
section".
it
doesn't
say
excludes
provisions
or
existing
law
that
may
be
found
in
other
sections.
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
why
the
texas
state
courts
can't
apply
federal
law
the
way
they
do
under
fela
and
under
1983?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
an
intermediate
ground
where
you
don't
cede
the
territory
back
but
you
say
that
federal
law
may
be
applied
in
the
courts
of
the
adjacent
state?
justice
rehnquist
did
these
accidents
take
place
on
artificial
islands?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
don't
you
have
some
trouble
with
rodrigue
on
which
you
rely
and
the
passage
that
says
a
compromise
emerged,
that
federal
law
would
prevail
but
that
the
states
would
have
some
jurisdiction
to
apply
that
federal
law
on
artificial
islands?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
rodrigue
it
says,
on
page
365,
that
the
special
relationship
between
the
men
working
on
these
artificial
islands
and
the
adjacent
shore
to
which
they
commute
to
visit
their
families
was
also
recognized
by
dropping
the
treatment
of
these
structures
as
vessels
and
instead
over
the
objections
of
the
administration
that
these
islands
were
not
really
located
within
the
states.
the
bill
was
amended
to
treat
them
as
if
they
were
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
located
within
a
state.

justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
was
just
a
codification.
justice
rehnquist
then
you
did
ask
for
the
instruction?
justice
rehnquist
res
judicata
would
prevent
that,
would
it
not?
sunshine
mining
v.
treinies
and
those
cases
say
that
even
though
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
when
it
started
out,
if
the
parties
litigated
the
issue
and
let
the
case
become
final,
it's
over;
you
can't
vacate
it.
