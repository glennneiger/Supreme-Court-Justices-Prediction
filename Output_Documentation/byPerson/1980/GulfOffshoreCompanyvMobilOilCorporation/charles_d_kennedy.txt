mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals,
14th
judicial
district,
on
a
matter
raising
two
issues.
first,
there's
an
issue
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
the
state
of
texas
to
consider
and
try
and
hear
cases
arising
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
the
second
issue
is
an
issue
involving
the
applicability
of
this
court's
ruling
in
the
case
of
liepelt
which
finds
that
juries
are
knowledgeable
taxpayers
of
this
country...
i'm
paraphrasing...
and
that
therefore
the
trial
court
has
the
duty
of
performing
and
providing
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
the
effect
of
federal
income
taxation
on
jury
damage
awards.
i'd
like
to
first
turn
briefly
to
what
i
feel
is
the
threshold
question,
and
that
is
the
question
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
allow
the
courts
of
many
states
to
take
jurisdiction
for
matters
arising
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
in
1953
the
outer
continental
shelf
was
becoming
a
very
vital
area.
the
congress
of
this
country
felt
at
that
time
that
there
must
be
a
necessity
for
jurisdiction
over
this
developing
area.
this
is
not
a
situation
of
the
congress
going
into
a
state
and
buying
land
or
taking
land
away
from
an
already
existing
state.
this
had
already
been
laid
to
rest
in
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
california.
california
had
claimed
ownership
of
the
tidelands.
the
state
found
that
the
united
states
had
paramount
jurisdiction
over
the
tidelands.
because
of
the
historic
nature
of
the
state's
claim
to
rights
in
the
tideland
areas,
congress
passed,
also
in
1953,
the
submerged
lands
act
which
ceded
to
the
states
that
area
lying
offshore
of
their
land
areas
that
had
historically
been
claimed
by
the
states.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
thought
of
to
encompass
the
entire
activities
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
beyond
the
submerged
land
act's
ceding
of
rights
to
territorial
waters
of
the
state.
the
personal
injury
aspect
of
this
case
comes
up
incidental.
this
is
really
a
case
involving
a
contractual
dispute
between
the
pool
corporation,
who
is
a
drilling
contractor,
and
mobil
oil
company,
who
was
the
leasor
of
the
area
that
was
being
drilled.
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
below
was
an
employee
of
pool
corporation,
an
employee
of
my
client.
on
the
basis
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
mr.
gaedecke,
the
plaintiff's
sole
remedy
against
pool
corporation
was
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
which
is
definitely
adopted
as
the
exclusive
remedy
of
employees
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
also
recognizes
the
right
of
third
party
suits
by
such
employees
under
section
905(b)
if
it
happens
to
be
due
to
the
negligence
of
a
vessel,
under
section
33
if
it
is
due
to
any
other
type
of
third
party
action.
so
this
all,
the
plaintiff's
primary
claim
had
to
arise
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
and
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
thereby
extended.
we
move
then
to
an
area
where
because
of
international
implication
the
government
had
severe
reservations
of
attempting
to
take
sovereignty
beyond
the
states'
historical
territorial
limits.
they
adopted
the
procedure
set
out
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
which
was
a
horizontal
extension
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
to
cover
the
subsoils,
seabeds,
and
any
artificial
islands
constructed
thereon.
the
act
specifically
did
not
attempt
to
take
on
any
jurisdiction
over
the
high
seas,
leaving
that
to
the
maritime
and
admiralty
courts.
the
act
itself,
after
first
providing
for
this
extension
of
jurisdiction,
then
turned
its
attention
to
what
laws
would
be
applicable
in
this
outer
continental
shelf
area,
in
this
new
area
of
jurisdiction
for
the
federal
government.
they
first
said
that
federal
law
and
regulations
are
applicable.
they
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
interior
the
right
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
which
were
made
applicable.
then,
in
order
to
plug
any
potential
gaps
or
voids
in
the
federal
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time,
they
said
that
we
are
going
to
adopt
as
federal
law
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
i'm
paraphrasing;
yes.
they
said...
i'm
paraphrasing
this...
that
if
there
is
a
void,
if
congress
has
not
acted,
or
if
there
has
been
no
rule
or
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
then,
to
fill
these
voids,
we
will
adopt,
or
we
will
have
as
surrogate
for
federal
law...
surrogate
federal
law...
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state.
but,
in
the
act
itself...
and
i
think
the
act
itself
clearly
shows
that
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction.
they
put
a
caveat...
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
and
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
the
enactment,
in
its
entirety,
to
see
the
congressional
scheme,
and
after
we
get
through
that,
i
think
that
the
congressional
scheme
within
the
act
itself
will
be
sufficient.
but
even
if
you
get
beyond
that,
then
you're
left
with
the
legislative
intent
which
i'll
go
into
in
a
minute.
the
caveat
that
was
put
in
the
act
in
subsection
(a)(2),
after
they
say,
"will
adopt
state
law
as
surrogate
federal
law.
"
says,
"all
applicable
laws
shall
be
administered
and
enforced
by
the
appropriate
officers
and
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
no.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
because
i
think
this
is
the
clear
congressional
intent.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
that's
right.
the
reason
i
think
congress
did
not
feel
compelled
to
include
this
word
1978
amendments
to
this
act,
even
dropped
out
the
word
"original",
was
because
this
was
an
area
where
there
was
no
concurrent
jurisdiction,
where
the
states
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
so
the
federal
government
went
out
and
said,
we
are
taking
jurisdiction
over
this
area.
and
therefore
the
word
"original"
and
the
word--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--i
think...
of
course,
if
we're
getting
out
to
sea
i
think
we're
getting
into
an
entirely
different
area,
where
we're
getting
into
the
admiralty
and
maritime
courts.
whether
the
states
have
any
jurisdiction
between
foreign
nationals
for
injuries
on
the
high
sea,
my
recollection
is
that
it's
exclusively
federal
at
that
point,
when
you
have
foreign
nationals
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
the
federal
courts
took
jurisdiction
over
that.
it
was
a
federal
court
case
arising
in
admiralty,
i
believe.
in
subsection
(3)
of
the
same
portion
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
i
think
even
further
confirmed
what
the
congressional
intent
was.
they
say
that
the
adoption
of
the
state
law
as
the
law
of
the
united
states
shall
never
be
interpreted
as
a
basis
for
claiming
any
interest
in
or
any
jurisdiction
on
behalf
of
any
state
for
any
purpose
over
the
seabeds
and
subsoil
of
the
outer
continental
shelf;
which
to
me
i
find
very
exclusive
in
its--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
any
existing
law
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
1953
act
that
gave
any
general
jurisdiction
to
state
courts
over
what
happens
on
the
high
seas
or,
at
that
time,
the
outer
continental
shelf.
prior
to
1953
there
was
no
outer
continental
shelf
as
we
know
it
now;
it
was
all
high
seas.
this
was
just
the
ground
under
the
high
seas.
the
congressional
intent
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history.
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
interior
and
insular
affairs,
which
is
the
majority
report,
the
court
will
recall
this
case,
this
act,
came
first
through
the
house,
was
sent
to
the
senate.
the
senate
deleted
practically
all
of
the
house
act,
substituted
their
own.
the
commerce
committee
accepted
it
and
then
it
became
law.
so
therefore
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
was
actually
the
majority
report.
it
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
assert
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
over
the
seabed,
subsoil,
and
artificial
islands.
they
said
that
we're
going
to
carry
out
this
primary
purpose
of
the
measure,
the
asserting
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
by
developing
a
body
of
law
which
is
going
to
extend
exclusively
to
this
area.
this
body
of
law
is
going
to
consist
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
in
the
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government.
next,
it's
going
to
incorporate
the
regulations,
rules,
and
operating
orders
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
and
three,
in
the
absence
of
any
applicable
federal
law
or
adequate
secretary's
regulation,
the
civil
and
criminal
law
of
the
state
adjacent
will
be
adopted
as
federal
law.
so,
here
again,
they
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
compelling
reasons
for
this
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
itself.
jurisdiction
could
have
been
ceded
by
the
federal
government
to
state
governments.
i
think,
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
since
we
have
no
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
begin
with
or
no
state
jurisdiction
over
this
area
to
begin
with,
there
was
a
taking
enacted
by
congress,
ceding
it
back
as
they
did
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
saying,
okay,
mr.
louisiana,
mr.
texas,
we
give
you
the
right
over
this
area.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
indicate
that
this
was
an
intent
of
congress.
in
fact,
the
minority
people
definitely
recognized
that
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress.
congress
wanted
the
adjacent
states
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
control
of
this
area
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
because
with
all
the
international
implications
that
were
then
involved,
congress
was
obviously
worried
at
that
time
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
hue
and
outcry
from
our
world
friends
that
we
were
trying
to
take
over
the
sovereignty
of
this
seabed
area.
that's
why
they
were
so
careful
in
placing
this,
i
feel,
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
to
rule
and
regulate
without
interference
from
the
many
states.
we're
talking
about
not
just
one
or
two
states
that
might
have
an
interest
in...
the
outer
continental
shelf
extends,
of
course,
completely
around
the
continental
united
states,
varying
in
size
from
250
miles
off
the
new
england
coast
to
50
to
150
miles
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
to
as
little
as
five
to
40
miles
off
california.
then,
when
you
get
to
alaska,
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
bigger
than
the
state
of
alaska
itself.
so
this
is
the
area
that
we
are
talking
about
that
congress
was
so
deeply
involved
in
and
interested
in.
the
act's
history
and
the
minority
report,
if
the
court
will
recall,
mr.
justice
white
has
had
an
opportunity
to
review
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
at
some
length
in
the
rodrigue
opinion.
i
think
from
a
reading
of
that
opinion
it
shows
a
clear
indication
of
the
vesting
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
as
noted
by
mr.
justice
white,
it
states
that
"on
the
other
hand,
federal
enforcement
of
the
law
in
this
area
was
insisted
upon
by
the
department
of
justice
and
there
was
substantial
doubt
whether
state
law
and
jurisdiction
could
or
should
be
extended
to
these
structures.
"
"a
federal
solution
was
thought
necessary.
"
the
legislative
history...
one
thing,
i
think,
should
be
pointed,
was,
this
act
was
fought
and
fought
bitterly
by
the
senators
from
louisiana,
the
senators
from
texas,
but
primarily
led
by
the
senators
from
louisiana.
senator
ellender,
the
senior
senator
from
louisiana,
offered
an
amendment
where,
and
described
in
his
own
words,
"my
amendment
is
very
simple.
"
"it
would
clarify
a
multiplicity
of
problems
which
are
bound
to
arise.
"
"it
would
give
coastal
states
the
right
to
extend
their
jurisdictions
to
these
lands.
"
"for
what
purposes?
"
"merely
for
the
purpose
of
administering
the
criminal
and
civil
laws
which
may
appertain
to
that
area.
"
and
this
amendment
was
defeated
by
congress.
again,
we
urge
it.
senator
long
from
louisiana
filed
a
subsequent
amendment
trying
to
get
congress
to
adopt
it,
accepting
for
the
most
part
all
of
senator
ellender's
original
amendment,
but
deleting
any
possibility
of
confusion
that
the
amendment
may
in
some
way
provide
for
the
taxing
powers
of
the
states.
we
thought
maybe
that
was
what
the
congress
was
looking
at,
just
simply
that
they
were
afraid
this
was
going
to
give
the
states
taxing
powers.
so,
he
specifically
deletes
that,
senator
long
does,
and
that
amendment
was
defeated
after
floor
argument.
senator
long
then
submitted
another
amendment;
it
was
a
compromise
amendment
with
the
majority
leaders,
and
simply
added
the
word
"adjacent
state"
to
what
law
was
to
be
adopted
as
federal
law,
because
the
original
act
said,
just
the
nearest
point
of
land,
the
law
would
apply.
so
they
put
in
this
adjacent
state
rule
instead
of
the
nearest
point
of
land.
and
that
is
what
was
finally
enacted.
senator
long
filed
the
minority
report
and
recognized
in
his
minority
report
that
there
was
no
state
court
jurisdiction
as
far
as
this
act
was
concerned,
and
that
was
his
brief
or
his
minority
report.
he
was
still
unhappy
and
dissatisfied
with
the
congressional
action,
so
i
think
there
was
clear
legislative
intent
as
to
what
congress
was
proposing
to
do.
now,
this
case
in
25
years
up
to
1978,
this
legislation,
had
already
been
piecemealed
and
added
to,
in
a
piecemeal
sort
of
way.
in
1978
there
was
a
codification
of
various
laws
and
rules
and
various
regulations
into
what's
been
referred
to
as
the
1978
amendments.
i
would
simply
like
to
point
out
that
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
the
1978
amendments
did
not
in
any
way
change
the
jurisdictional
approach.
it
was
simply
a
recodification.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
i
don't
believe
rodrigue,
your
honor,
in
rodrigue,
that
was
at
all
the
holding.
rodrigue
was
simply,
was
this
a
maritime
case
or
was
this
an
outer
continental
shelf
lands
case?
and
the
maritime
law--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--the
whole
approach
there
is
applicable
law.
this
was
the
question
in
rodrigue.
what
is
the
applicable
law?
and
the
applicable
law,
as
recognized
by
rodrigue,
is
going
to
be
federal
law.
they
do
not
adopt
admiralty
and
maritime
law.
that
was
the
effect
of
it.
and
they
simply
go
back
and
reiterate
the
standards
of
law
that's
applied
under
the
act.
first,
federal
law;
second,
rules
and
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
interior;
and
then,
if
there
is
no
applicable
federal
law,
then
you
look
to
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state,
not
as
state
law,
not
as
an
erie
type
of
court,
but
as
a
federal
law.
and
i
think
the
1978
amendments
clearly
show
what
has
happened
in
this
area.
when
you
started
in
1953,
there
were
a
lot
of
areas
where
there
might
have
been
voids,
where
there
was
no
applicable
federal
law
at
that
time
and
they
needed
something
to
look
to,
to
build
and
evolve
a
federal
law.
the
1978
amendments
strengthened
the
control
of
the
federal
government
over
civil
suits.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
well,
it
was
a
codification
as
far
as
all
of
these
piecemeal
legislations
that
have
been
adopted
over
the
25-year
period
from
'53
to
'78.
these
were
recodified
into
this
one
act.
a
lot
of
the
rules
and
regulations
were
referred
to
and
brought
into
the
act.
but,
really,
then
it
strengthens
it.
and
let,
if
i
may
point
out
the
strengthening,
it
provided
that
there
was
a
law
with,
in
suit,
in
federal
court,
to
compel
compliance
with
the
act,
and
with
any
regulations.
now,
there
might
have
been
a
void
there,
so
that
they
thought
they
had
to
do
that.
but
even
more
important,
as
a
second
item,
they
provided
a
suit
for
damages
to
any
resident
who
is
in
any
manner
injured,
be
it
any
personal
injury
or
any
other
type
of
injury
due
to
an
operator's,
such
as
mining
people,
noncompliance
with
a
rule,
regulation,
or
permit
issued
pursuant
to
the
act,
and
in
connection
with
what's
been
referred
to
as
a
citizen's
suit,
they
granted
award
of
attorneys'
fees
to
be
added
on
to
the
damages,
and
they
granted
the
award
of
witness
fees.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
you're
referring
to
the
liepelt
construction
now,
your
honor?
there's
no
doubt
after
having
tried
the
case,
they
were
implying
texas
laws,
as
a
procedural
type
of
law.
no,
the
appellate
court
did
not
really
address
it
in
view
of
the
liepelt
decision,
but
the
liepelt
decision
didn't
come
down
until
after
the
appellate
court's
opinion.
i
can't
say
that
i...
i
really
don't
know
what
was
in
the
judge's
mind;
it
was
just,
as
the
record
will
reflect,
one
of
the
basic
issues.
but
i
was
representing
a
third-party
defendant.
did
i
even
have
a
right
to
raise
this
issue?
don't
i
even
have
a
right
to
ask
for
this
instruction?
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
as
to
whether
this
is
texas
law?
well,
of
course,
texas
law
would
not
even
apply
in
this
case,
your
honor,
even
if
you
say
that
state
courts
have
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
this
happened
off
the
coast
of
louisiana.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
i
think
it's
very
clear.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
it
was
not,
at
that
time.
but,
it's
been
referred
to
that
you'd
have
to
be
omniscient
to
ever
have
decided
that
the
supreme
court
would
do
what
they
did.
i
say
this
is
not
true.
this
is
an
instruction
we've
been
fighting
for
and
asked
for
for
years,
and
if...
i'm
no
more
omnipotent
than
any
other
defense
attorney;
and
it's
an
instruction
that
i
think
and
felt
had
to
be
asked
for
under
the
federal
law.
we
knew
we
were
dealing
with
federal
law.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
we
did
ask
for
the
instruction;
it
was
refused.
the
instruction
that
i
asked
for
is
almost
right
in
line
with
the
instruction
that
was
in
the
liepelt
case.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
well,
i
didn't
really
anticipate
the
liepelt
decision
but
i
knew
sooner
or
later
that
the
law
had
to
recognize
the
fact
that
juries
were
continuously
being
confused
by
the
fact
that
nobody
would
tell
them
what
effect
taxes
had
on
them.
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
thing
clear,
it
is
our
position
that
the
liepelt
opinion
simply
requires
an
instruction
by
the
judge
to
the
jury
that
they
should
neither
take
it,
neither
increase
nor
delete
anything
from
their
award
because
of
federal
income
tax
and
it
is
that
the
award
is
not
subject
to
federal
taxation.
i
think
this
is
what
the
court
has
done
in
liepelt.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
then
i
think
the
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
what?
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
if
remanded,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
at
least
on
damages.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
yes,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--is
what?
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
the
jury
found
the
damages.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
all
in
one
proceeding.
there
has
been
no
appeal
taken
from
the
jury's
award
against
mobil.
the
only
appeal
before
this
court
is
on
mobil's
claim
over
against
us
for
indemnity.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
not
as
long
as
it's
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
this
is
not
applying
straight
law
as
an
erie
court
would.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
is
federal
law--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--there
is
about
taxes,
there
is
about
interest.
i
have
referred
the
court--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--rodrigue
has
thrown
that
out,
sir;
that
is
not
applicable.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
there
may
be
in
certain
areas,
your
honor.
i
can't
really
answer
it.
i
know
that
as
to
the
interest
on
awards
on
judgment,
like
an
aymond
opinion
out
of
the
5th
circuit,
that
there,
there
is
a
federal
law.
liepelt,
there
is
a
federal
law.
so--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--in
this
area--
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
--right.
mr.
charles
d.
kennedy
thank
you,
your
honor.
