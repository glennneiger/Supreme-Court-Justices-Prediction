mr.
frank
e.
caton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
objective
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
is
clearly
stated
in
the
presidential
proclamation
1945,
in
the
congressional
record,
and
in
the
act
itself.
it
says
specifically
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
resources
in
the
shelf.
and
that
is
what
the
states
and
the
federal
government
were
fighting
over,
the
resources.
they
gave
no
deliberate
attention
to
what
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
these
disputes
arising
out
of
the
act
on
the
shelf.
no
one
has
taken
the
position
on
the
respondents'
side
of
the
aisle
that
we
are
asking
that
the
courts
of
the
states
have
sole
jurisdiction
of
these
cases.
the
administration
complained
about
those
provisions
in
the
act
originally
which
would
provide,
apparently,
for
sole
jurisdiction
in
state
courts.
and
they
insisted
that
the
act
be
amended
so
as
to
provide
that
you
would
treat
those
fixed
structures
and
fixed
platforms
as
if
they
were
an
area
of
federal...
a
federal
enclave;
that's
what
they
were
to
be
treated
as,
as
an
area
of
federal
jurisdiction
located
within
a
state.
we
say
that
that
falls
directly
in
line
with
this
court's
opinion
expressed
by
justice
marshall
in
the
evans
case
out
of
the
state
of
maryland,
when
we
had
a
federal
enclave
in
which
the
voters
complained
that
they
were
being
deprived
by
the
commissioners
of
maryland
of
their
voting
rights.
and
the
court's
clear
statement
in
there
was
that
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
residents
of
a
federal
enclave
within
the
state,
that
the
state
courts
had
jurisdiction
and
the
state
courts
had
process
over
those
certain
residents
of
that
federal
enclave.
the
act
says
specifically
that
you
will
treat
those
platforms
as
federal
enclaves.
now,
the
claflin
v.
houseman
decision
which
came
one
year
after
the
federal
lower
court
system
was
established,
1876,
actually
addresses
the
very
contentions
which
are
being
made
by
gulf
offshore
in
this
case.
they
say
that
jurisdiction,
exclusive
jurisdiction,
in
a
sovereign
follows
the
sovereignty.
and
that
a
state
court
is
not
entitled
to
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
that
was
put
to
rest
in
houseman,
specifically.
justice
story
in
the
martin
v.
hunter
case
had
agreed
with
that
proposition
and
was
disagreed
with
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
by
justice
bradley
and
in
it
he
said,
that
that
general
principle,
that
where
the
state
courts
had
historic
concurrent
jurisdiction,
you
are
not
going
to
take
that
away
from
them
unless
you
do
what
mr.
hamilton
said
you
must
do
in
no.
82
of
the
federalist
papers.
he
said
you
can
only
do
that
in
three
ways.
you
can
do
it
by
express
language
in
the
statute;
you
can,
secondly,
do
it,
if
it's
not
express
language,
you
can
give
it
by
express
language
a
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
deny
the
state
courts
jurisdiction.
that's
the
second
way.
if
you
can't
do
it
in
those
two
ways,
then
you
must
show
that
the
exercise
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts
is
simply
incompatible
by
the
nature
of
the
case
itself
with
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts.
now,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
we
cannot
fathom
why
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
outer
continental
shelf
lands
cases
should
not
be
handled
by
a
state
court.
the
objective
of
the
act
is
not
being
offended
in
any
way
by
state
court
jurisdiction,
there
is
very
little
difference
in
the
discovery
rules.
there
is
no
federal
specialty
which
has
been
built
up
over
the
years
in
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
cases
which
give
the
federal
courts
some
particular
specialized
knowledge
or
expertise
over
this
type
of
case
in
any
way.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
gulf
offshore's
brief
they
cite
in
support
of
one
of
their
positions
a
case
called,
in
re
dearborn.
that
case
arose
off
the
texas
coast
on
a
fixed
platform.
five
or
six
men
were
killed
because
of
an
explosion
and
fire.
one
of
those
men
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
monk,
whose
survivors
filed
an
action
in
the
state
district
court
in
texas.
that
case
was
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
and
it
was
joined
in
with
all
of
the
other
survivors'
actions
arising
out
of
the
case.
that
case
went
to
conclusion,
went
through
the
5th
circuit,
cert
was
denied
by
this
court.
are
we
now
to
take
the
position
that
that
case,
that
all
of
the
judgments
entered
in
that
case,
are
void
because
that
derivative
jurisdiction
which
the
federal
court
had
to
depend
on
in
order
to
hold
that
monk
case
in
his
court...
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
is
derivative--
mr.
frank
e.
caton
--i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
really
trying
to
make
is
that
under
the
lambert
run
coal
company
line
of
cases,
it's
clear
that
a
federal
court
cannot
take
jurisdiction
in
a
removed
action
unless
the
state
court
had
original
jurisdiction
of
that
case.
now,
if
that's
the
case...
and
i
think
that
it
is...
judge
rubin,
whom
they
rely
on,
is
the
only
federal
lower
court
who
has
held
that
the
state
courts
don't
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
he
should
have
dismissed
the
fluor
case
because
the
state
court,
he
said,
didn't
have
jurisdiction
originally.
he
should
have
simply
dismissed
it,
and
he
did
not
do
that.
it's
just
inconsistent
that
he
could
rely
on
the
contention
that
the
federal
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
then
say
that
the
state
court,
he
had
derivative
jurisdiction
out
of
that
same
state
court.
now,
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
objective
of
developing
the
riches,
the
resources
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
congress
simply
passed
two
acts.
it
passed
the
submerged
lands
act,
which
was
called
the
quitclaim
legislation
which
gave
the
gulf
states
a
three
marine
leagues
area
off
their
low
mean
tide
shore,
and
it
gave
the
ocean
states
a
three
statute
mile
area
off
their
coast.
then
it
came
along
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
case
and
said,
now
we're
going
to
take
care
of
two
things:
we
are
going
to
provide
for
development
of
those
riches,
and
we
are
going
to
provide
for
what
you
are
going
with
the
revenue
that
you
obtain
from
those
riches.
that's
all
they
said.
i
think,
when
we
get
back
to
the
claflin
v.
houseman
rule,
which
says
that
unless
you
can
meet
one
of
the
tests
which
were
established
by
mr.
hamilton,
that
i've
already
mentioned,
then
you
cannot
take
away
from
the
state
courts
their
historic
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
these
cases.
now,
i
don't
dispute
that
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
created
a
new
statutory
remedy,
and
we
started
from
scratch
with
a
federal
law
which
we
have
to
apply
as
surrogate
federal
law,
but
it
is
not
a
new
remedy.
and
strangely
enough,
in
the
houseman
case,
again,
mr.
bradley
anticipated
that,
justice
bradley,
and
he
said
specifically,
that
it
was
mentioned
by
justice
story.
he
said
it
was
indeed
intimated
by
mr.
justice
story
over
a
dictum
in
martin
v.
hunter
that
the
state
courts
could
not
take
cognizance
of
cases
arising
under
the
constitution,
laws,
and
treaties
of
the
united
states,
as
no
such
jurisdiction
existed
before
the
constitution
was
adopted.
"this
is
true
as
to
jurisdiction
depending
on
united
states
authority,
but
the
same
jurisdiction
existed,
at
least
to
a
certain
extent,
under
the
authority
of
the
states.
"
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"the
change
of
authority
creating
the
right
did
not
change
the
nature
of
the
right
itself.
"
we
are
simply
saying
that
this
is
a
simple,
common
law
negligence
action.
the
character
of
that
right
wasn't
changed
because
the
federal
government
declares
initial
jurisdiction
over
that
territory,
and
the
practical
question
to
ask,
then,
is,
what
is
going
to
happen
when
i
get
this
$183
sworn
account
case
that
i
have
in
my
office,
and
i
give
it
to
a
federal
judge...
he's
got
600
or
700
cases
on
his
docket...
and
tell
him
that
you
must
rule
on
that
case
because
we
can't
take
that
to
the
county
court.
if
we
are
really
looking
at
the
pragmatic
factors,
because
congress
didn't
and
we
therefore
have
to
do
it,
how
can
we
be
pragmatic
and
take
the
position
that
we
are
going
to
congest
the
federal
court
dockets
more
by
giving
them
all
of
the
cases
and
controversies
which
were
traditionally
handled
by
state
courts
and
turn
those
into
the
hands
of
federal
courts?
that
is
not
being
pragmatic.
the
act
does
not
say,
exclusions.
the
idea
that
because
you
do
not
say,
we
are
granting
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
the
state
courts,
has
been
ridiculed
many
times
by
the
treatise
writers,
including
professor
redish,
because
that's
begging
the
question.
the
fact
that
you
do
not
grant
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
the
state
courts
means
nothing.
you
don't
grant
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
the
state
courts,
you
take
it
away;
that's
what
congress
does.
there
is
no
prohibition
against
state
jurisdiction
in
the
act,
so
that
you
can't
meet
the
second
test
that
mr.
hamilton
established,
and
no
viable
or
justifiable
reason
has
been
suggested
why
we
should
dump
these
cases
on
the
federal
district
court.
there
is
no
pragmatic
reason
for
it.
i
would
like
to
say,
with
respect
to
the
liepelt
decision--
mr.
frank
e.
caton
--no,
that
is
something
i'm
sure
that
a
number
of
judges
i
know
would
like
to
see
happen,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
e.
caton
federal
courts.
i
have
no
preference.
it's
like
asking
a
marine
in
a
foxhole
whether
he
prefers
strafing
or
bombing,
which
court
i'm
in,
so
i
don't
see
any
preference.
i
would
like
to
say
with
respect
to
the
liepelt
decision,
briefly,
the
reason
why
the
district
court
judge
in
the
state,
the
trial
judge,
didn't
have
anything
in
his
mind
was
because
the
jury
didn't
have
anything
in
their
minds.
and
they
didn't
have
anything
in
their
minds
because
they
didn't
have
any
evidence,
and
i'm
saying
that
the
liepelt
decision
doesn't
say
you
can
give
that...
that
very...
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
that
is
a
confusing
instruction
in
the
absence
of
explanation.
the
only
explanation
you
can
give--
mr.
frank
e.
caton
--well,
your
honor,
it
was
on
the
books.
it
simply
wasn't
in
the
appellate
books
but
everybody
knew
that
that
case
was
about
to
be
decided.
mr.
frank
e.
caton
but
the
arguments
that
were
being
made
in
this
court--
mr.
frank
e.
caton
--that's
right,
it
was
not
binding,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
e.
caton
your
honor,
there's
a
very
simple
explanation
for
that.
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
if
it
is,
the
federal
law
provides
clearly
that
you
may
not
give
an
instruction
in
the
absence
of
evidence.
that's
not
a
state
rule.
mr.
frank
e.
caton
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
frank
e.
caton
--there
is
no
evidence,
your
honor,
but...
all
right,
i'll
tell
you
the
evidence
that
i
think
should
have
been
put
in,
briefly,
one
of
the
instructions.
they
should
have
put
in
the
code
section
which
says
that
these
awards
are
not
subject
to
taxation.
they
should
have
put
in
the
1040
instruction
book,
they
should
have
put
in
the
1040--
mr.
frank
e.
caton
--the
form
1040;
the
irs
1040
instruction
book.
they
should
have
put
in
the
tax
table.
they
could
have
at
least
argued
with
that
information,
could
simply
have
been
put
in,
they
could
have
argued
from
that
and
explained
to
the
jury...
or
better
still,
they
could
have
done
what
the
leipelt
court
suggested,
offer
expert
testimony
to
explain
to
the
jury
rather
than
to
confuse
them,
what
that
instruction
meant.
but
the
idea
that
that
was
a
state
procedural
rule
is
accurate,
but
it's
also
a
federal
procedural
rule;
that's
clear.
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
that
you
may
not
give
an
instruction,
an
explanatory
instruction,
in
the
absence
of
clear
evidence
in
the
record.
and
i'm
saying
that
the
people
who
are
complaining
about
the
judges'
failure
to
do
that
are
asking
the
judge
to
give
an
instruction
on
no
evidence.
mr.
frank
e.
caton
you'd
give
them
the
second
chance
to
do
what
they
should
have
done
the
first
time.
that's
offer
evidence.
thank
you,
your
honors.
