justice
jr.
and
again,
it
doesn't
say
"exclusively".
justice
jr.
but
you
want
us
to
read
it
that
way,
i
take
it?
justice
jr.
you
mean
federal
court
judges?
justice
jr.
what's
the
evidence
that's
missing,
mr.
caton?
justice
jr.
1040
what?
justice
jr.
mr.
jamail,
may
i
get
back
to
the
liepelt
question
again?
justice
jr.
i
gather...
do
i
correctly
understand
your
argument?
even
if
this
case
were
tried
the
day
after
liepelt's
decision
here,
you'd
be
arguing
just
as
you
are
now?
justice
jr.
i
know.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
you'd
be
arguing
that
no
liepelt
construction
was
required,
notwithstanding
the
case
is
tried
after
liepelt?
justice
jr.
well,
you
would
say
it
would
be
error
to
give
it.
not
only
that
it
wasn't
required,
it
would
be
error
to
give
it?
