justice
white
so
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts,
but
agree
with
you
on
the
instruction?
justice
white
would
it
be
a
new
trial
then?
justice
white
on
liability
or
damages
or
what?
justice
white
but,
of
course,
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
this
first...
it
would
wipe
out
the
entire--
justice
white
--is
it...
the
jury
set
the
damages?
justice
white
the
jury
found
the
damages?
justice
white
all
in
one
proceeding?
justice
white
well,
maybe
you
could
suggest
some
way
that
we
could
hold
that
the
state
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
white
was
liepelt
on
the
books
when
the
trial
took
place?
justice
white
about
to
be,
but
it
wasn't?
justice
white
yes,
i
know,
but
it
wasn't,
but
it
wasn't--
justice
white
--your
argument
goes
at
least
as
far
as
that
we
shouldn't
decide
the
instruction
should
have
been
given.
but
why
shouldn't
we
remand
to
see
if
the
district
judge,
the
trial
judge
thought
that
this
was
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
he
should
decide
whether
it
should
be
given?
justice
white
it
may
be
but
then
we
ought
to
have
the
district
judge
decide
that.
you
are
asking
us
to
look
at
the
record
and
come
up
with
our
own
view
of
the
facts.
justice
white
so
you're
just
saying
that
if
we
remand
it
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
liepelt,
it
would
just
be
a
useless
act?
justice
white
what
about
a
case
in
the
federal
court,
the
same
kind
of
a
case
as
this
one,
in
the
federal
court
that's
filed
and
tried
tomorrow?
would
it
be
error
to
give
the
liepelt
instruction?
justice
white
not
to
give
it;
yes;
not
to
give
it.
justice
white
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
about
that.
i
asked
you
about
this
kind
of
case.
justice
white
i'm
asking
you
about
it,
about
this
kind
of
a
case
that
arises
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
under
this...
and
it's
federal
law
borrowing
state
law
except
to
the
extent
that
it's
inconsistent?
justice
white
well,
we
aren't...
we
were
extending
it
to
a
statutory,
to
a
claim
under
a
statute,
aren't
we?
justice
white
you
didn't
say
we'd
borrowed
state
law.
it
says,
federal
law.
justice
white
well,
it
certainly
wasn't
brought
under
state
law.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
how
could
it
be?
justice
white
oh,
so
you're
saying
this
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
doesn't
apply
at
all?
justice
white
is
it
federal
or
law
or
not,
that
controls
this
case?
justice
white
it's
only
borrowed.
it's
only
federal
law
borrowing
state
law.
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law
then?
justice
white
well,
okay.
you
can
have
it
your
way.
justice
white
well,
the
exclusive
argument...
if
you're
right,
the
exclusive
argument
is
beside
the
point,
because
it's
state
law,
and
obviously
you're
not
going
to
have
some
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
over
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
justice
white
so
it
is
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute?
justice
white
there's
nothing
wrong
with
being
cross-wise
with
me.
many
people
are.
