mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represented
mr.
gaedecke
in
the
trial
below
and
up
to
and
including
this
point
he
was
injured
in
1975.
the
act
that
petitioners
ask
this
court
to
now
construe
by
adding
the
word
1953.
it
was
amended
in
1978.
mr.
gaedecke's
case
did
not
go
to
trial
until
after
the
act
had
been
amended.
the
act
was
amended
in
september,
1978.
mr.
gaedecke's
case
went
to
trial
in
november,
1978.
mr.
gaedecke
was
30
years
of
age.
the
evidence
in
the
case,
as
elicited
by
me
from
the
doctors,
from
expert
testimony,
showed
that
his
lost
earnings
would
exceed
by
twice
what
the
jury
assessed
as
damages.
he
had
major
surgery
three
times,
spinal
surgery.
it
differs...
it
bring
this
to
the
court's
attention
to
show
the
difference
between
gaedecke
and
liepelt.
leipelt
was
this
court
construing
a
federal
statute,
where
the
damages
were
confined
to
net
pecuniary
loss.
no
such
test
exists
in
gaedecke.
so,
if
the
instruction
is
correct
in
liepelt,
there
is
no
reason
to
extend
it
to
a
common
law
negligence
action
where
pain
and
suffering
are
la
major
element
of
that
cause
of
action
damagewise.
and
what
other
differences
do
we
have?
in
liepelt,
we
had
the,
in
that
case,
the
we
had
the
complaining
party
attempting
to
introduce
evidence
showing
what
tax
brackets,
and
the
evidence
regarding
income
tax,
and
then
that
evidence
was
denied
by
the
trial
judge
and
he
was
not
allowed
the
instruction.
in
this
case,
all
we
had
was,
counsel
for
petitioner,
after
all
of
the
evidence
was
closed
and
the
case
was
over,
handing
the
trial
judge
a
piece
of
paper
asking
for
an
instruction.
the
louisiana
law
forbade
this.
the
texas
law
procedurally
forbade
this.
liepelt
had
not
been
handed
down.
we
must
look
at
this
case
as--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--i
believe
that
it
would
be
error
not
to
give
it
in
a
fela
case.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
an
fela
case.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
a
common
law
tort
action?
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
i
think
that
unless
this
court
desires
to
extend
the
liepelt
rule
to
a
common
law
tort
damage
element
action,
which
it
did
not
do
in
the
fela
case,
because
you
were
looking
at
a
net
pecuniary
loss,
where
income
taxes
may
have
been--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--aha,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
so.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
this
action
was
brought
under
a
common
law
tort.
the
second
most
important
document,
in
reply
to
your
question--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--the
action?
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
well,
it
most
certainly
was,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
because,
your
honor,
of
the
savings
to
suitors
clause
of
the
1789
judiciary
act
gave
them
this
right
unless--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
it
is
state
law,
and
you've
so
stated--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--borrowed,
begged,
or
bought,
your
honor,
it's
still
state
law.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
well,
your
honor,
unless
we're
ready
to
repeal
the
1789
judiciary
act,
the
savings
to
suitors
clause,
it's
still
state
law.
where
in
the
act...
and
i
have
asked,
in
my
brief,
for
petitioner
to
point
out
so
we
would
know,
where
in
the
act
does
it
give
mr.
gaedecke
or
anybody
else
the
right
to
bring
suit?
it
has
none.
the
section
he
refers
to,
your
honor,
is
section
2,
which
was
brought
about
after
olsen
v.
shell,
when
justice
brown
ruled
that
there
was
no
remedy
under
this
act,
and
it
was
put
in
to,
for
one
reason
only,
your
honor,
not
common
law
actions.
and
all
one
need
do
is
read
it,
and
it
says,
for
violations
of
rules
or
regulations,
not
common
law...
rules
and
regulations
are
not
common
law.
and
it
is
very
clear...
we
must
assume,
correctly
or
incorrectly,
that
some
of
the
members
can
read
and
write
the
rudimentary
english
language.
now,
the
only
time
7
under
section
of
"citizens'
rights
to
sue",
and
it
says,
"when
a
suit
is
brought
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
then
jurisdiction
lies
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
and
the
deal
is
exclusive
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia.
"
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
but
we
have
to
address
it,
because
this
court
does
have
the
right
to
interpret
that
statute,
and
i
must
address
myself--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--no,
it
is
a
cause
of
action
applying
state
law,
and
if
we're
going
to
be
semantical,
state
law
under
the
statute.
but
it's
still
state
law,
and
state
law
forbade
us
to
submit
an
income
tax
instruction.
and,
another
thing,
procedurally
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
the
power
if
monger
v.
florida
is
still
the
law
to
address
itself
to
this
question,
because
under
the
texas
procedural
law
counsel
has
the
responsibility
not
only
to
present
the
issue
to
the
court
but
to
have
it
marked
"refused"
and
made
a
part
of
the
record.
this
was
not
done
in
this
case.
issue
no.
c,
which
he
relies
on
is
not
marked
"refused"
in
any
way.
we
have
no
way
to
know
whether
or
not
the
judge
refused
it.
procedurally
he
did
not
comply
with
everything
he
must
do
in
order
for
this
court
to
rule
on
the
matter.
jurisdiction,
if
i
may,
again.
never
do
we
see
the
word,
and
i
would
like
to...
original
jurisdiction
has
meaning
in
only
one
context,
that
is
when
it
is
applied
in
relation
to
appellate
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
that
i
don't
need
to
dwell
upon
that.
but
as
i
can
say
it
no
better
than
justice
brennan
said
it
in
sun
ship
v.
pennsylvania,
if
counsel's
argument
is
that
exclusion
of
the
word
"original"
then
made
it
necessary
for
you
to
interpret
it
as
meaning
"exclusive",
then
that
is
a
tour
de
force
of
statutory
interpretation,
and
i
begged
and
borrowed
the
words
from
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
i
would
have
to,
because
liepelt
was
talking
about
an
fela
case.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
yes,
and
i
hope
and
pray
that
that's
what
this
court
will
write.
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
i
think
it
would
be
under
the
existing
louisiana
law,
as
it
was
at
the
time,
justice
white,
because
we
had
case
law,
louisiana
law,
and
incidentally,
there
is
no
confusion
under
which
law
this
case
was
tried
under.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
emphatically
states
it
was
tried
under
louisiana
law
and
it
was,
using
the
texas
rules
of
procedure,
which
we
were
required
to
do.
now,
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
crosswise
with
you,
this
is...
the
only
one
who
gets
hurt
in
this
is
mr.
gaedecke.
look
at
the
miscarriage
of--
mr.
joseph
d.
jamail
--i'm
crosswise
with
too
many
people
already.
let
me
say
this
to
you,
and
seriously
so,
what
happens
to
poor
mr.
gaedecke?
the
respondent
lays
back
until
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
and
then
says
you
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
over
here.
and
then
he
comes
in
and
says,
no
jurisdiction.
now,
what
happens
to
mr.
gaedecke?
the
court
can
say,
well,
we
will
rely
on
justice
potter
stewart's
opinion
in
the
chevron
v.
huson
which
said
that,
well,
it
would
be
too
harsh
and
too
unjust
to
send
it
back
now
because
where
is
his
remedy?
but
i'm
not
relying
on
that.
this
is
not...
i'm
saying
the
law
itself,
the
act
itself,
imposes
no
exclusive
jurisdiction.
i
hope
that
that's
been
made
clear
and
hopefully
this
court
will
not
by
judicial
fiat
say,
all
right,
we're
going
to
say
exclusive
jurisdictions.
and
incidentally
the
character
of
what
happened...
we
can't
listen
to
floor
debates
by
senators
and
congressmen
who
are
interested
in
gloamming
off
some
of
the
profits
from
the
undersea
belt.
what
you've
got
to
do
is
take
it
in
context.
what
did
the
explanation
committee
of
the
floor
managers
of
the
bill
tell
us?
what
does
that
teach
us?
it
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
ever
be
construed
to
put
a
limit
on
anyone's
remedy
for
injury
or
death.
now,
again,
we
must
assume
congress
can
read
and
write
english.
some
may
not,
but
here
we
must.
they
said
what
they
wanted
to
say.
they
had
two
cracks
at
it
to
say
"exclusive"
and
both
times
turned
it
down.
originally,
and
in
the
amendments.
but
back
to
liepelt.
if
the
court
is
going
to
extend
liepelt...
and
i'm
asking
the
court
to
do
it
in
a
"sunburst"
sort
of
way
and
not
make
it
retroactive
with
the
harshness
that
would
result
to
this
man,
simply
because
the
case
was
tried,
as
it
had
to
be,
of
necessity,
under
the
rules
that
existed
at
the
time,
and
both
louisiana
substantive
law
and
texas
procedural
law
forbade
its
inclusion,
the
texas
substantive
law.
he
is
not
properly
before
this
court
on
the
issue
of
liepelt,
unless
you
want
to
overrule
monger
v.
florida.
and
that's
made
clear
in
our
brief.
and
i
can
only
hope
that
the
court
will
not
inflict
us...
we
have
to
try
lawsuits...
with
the
further
burden,
as
counsel
for
respondent
suggests,
a
new
body
of
federal
law.
what's
it
going
to
be
called?
nobody
intended
that.
it's
already
very
difficult
to
try
one
of
these
cases,
and
the
court
said
that,
and
everyone,
i
think,
will
agree
that
the
courts
below
are
doing
all
they
can
to
interpret.
i
think,
whatever
happens,
there
ought
to
be
a
clear
enunciation,
first
that
there
is
no
exclusivity
in
the
federal
court
for
this
type
of
action
for
if
there
had
meant
to
be
congress
would
have
told
us
so.
secondly,
that
we
will
not
further
encroach
on
state
jurisdiction
by
judicial
fiat.
and
thirdly,
that
we
will
not
extend
liepelt
beyond
what
it
was
intended
to
do.
for
what
is
a
jury
to
do
with
an
instruction
without
evidence?
are
they
to
go
in
and
then
sit
back
in
the
jury
room
and
say,
well,
i
wonder
what
bracket
he'll
be
in?
will
somebody
go
to
the
phone
and
call
h.
r.
block,
maybe
he
can
help
us.
what
do
we
do
with
this?
it's
already
enough
confusion.
i
say
that
there
must
be
evidence.
and
if
the
court
is
just
going
to
issue
a
ukase,
a
decree,
that
says,
evidence
or
not,
the
instruction
should
be
granted,
then
how
do
we
do
this
in
the
face
of
the
penrod
cases,
starnes
and
johnson
cases,
where
the
court
has
ruled...
i
was
the
lawyer
that
tried
those
also,
unfortunately...
that
inflation
cannot
be
considered?
well,
what
is
more
speculative
than
what
is
going
to
happen
to
us
taxwise?
is
inflation
more
speculative?
it's
omitted
because
even
evidence
is
omitted
in
a
diversity
case,
which
that
was.
so,
i
am
asking
this
court
to
confine
liepelt
to
what
it's
meant
to
be,
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute,
and
a
death
case
at
that,
where
the
net
pecuniary
loss
is
the
damage
issue
involved;
and
not
to
insert
it
into
the
common
law
tort
action
where
there
are
other
elements
of
damages;
and
certainly
to
hold
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
and
to
consider
the
fact
of
the
injustice
that
will
occur
to
gaedecke
if
this
case
is
reversed,
and
if
this
court
holds
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
lies
in
the
federal
courts.
