justice
blackmun
mr.
evans,
let
me
go
back
to
the
prior
question.
suppose
this
case
had
been
instituted
by
a
foster
parent,
not
the
state.
would
you
be
here?
justice
blackmun
mr.
odom,
let
me
follow
through
on
one
factual
thing
that
disturbs
me.
does
the
record
disclose
whether
between
the
removal
in
1975
and
the
termination
in
1978
a
department
social
worker
ever
contacted
the
petitioner
or
her
mother?
justice
blackmun
and
what
does
it
show?
justice
blackmun
on
several
occasions?
