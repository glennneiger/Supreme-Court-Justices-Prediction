mr.
leowen
evans
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
appointed
counsel
is
a
process
that
is
due
indigent
parents
when
the
state
initiates
actions
to
terminate
their
parental
rights.
the
state
of
north
carolina
terminated
the
parental
rights
of
abby
gail
lassiter,
an
indigent
imprisoned
mother,
without
affording
her
the
assistance
of
appointed
counsel.
this
contested
proceeding
was
initiated
and
prosecuted
by
the
state
through
its
authorized
official,
the
durham
county
department
of
social
services,
the
respondent
before
this
honorable
court.
the
respondent
was
represented
by
staff
attorneys,
and
by
a
social
worker.
in
rendering
its
decision
to
terminate
parental
rights,
the
trial
court
expressly
stated
that
it
relied
upon
the
testimony
before
the
court
and
the
record
before
the
court.
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
decision,
holding
that
the
right
to
family
integrity
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
that
the
state
has
invaded
this
constitutionally
protected
right,
but
that
this
invasion
was
not
so
serious
or
unreasonable
as
to
compel
the
court
to
hold
that
appointed
counsel
was
a
process
that
was
constitutionally
due
the
poor.
to
the
contrary,
mr.
justices,
appointed
counsel
is
a
process
that
must
be
due
if
indigent
parents
are
to
be
afforded
an
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
termination
proceedings.
there
is
a
per
se
need
for
appointed
counsel
because
of
the
inherent
risk
that
exists
otherwise.
mr.
leowen
evans
no,
mr.
justice,
not
a
purely
civil
proceeding.
this
court
hasn't
gone
beyond...
hasn't
appointed
counsel
in
a
purely
civil
proceeding.
this
court
has
held
that
in
a
noncriminal
proceeding,
such
as
gagnon,
that
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
may
exist.
mr.
leowen
evans
pardon?
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
in
gault.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
i...
a
plurality
of
the
court
recognized
in
vitek
v.
jones
the
need
for
appointed
counsel.
mr.
leowen
evans
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
all
parties
involved
have
a
compelling
reason
to
prevent
erroneous
terminations.
mr.
leowen
evans
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
was
the
rationale
for
gault.
however,
in
vitek
v.
jones,
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
transfer
of
a
prisoner
to
a
mental
institution
involuntarily.
there
was
no
question
about
his
right
to
freedom
from
bodily
restraint
being
involved
there.
that
right
had
already
been
extinguished
and
the
majority
of
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
a
right
to...
i'm
sorry...
a
plurality
of
the
court
recognized
there
was
a
need
for
appointed
counsel
in
those
cases
to
protect
the
interests
involved.
practical
considerations
will
not
mitigate
against
the
indigent
parent's
compelling
need
to
be
heard.
specifically,
the
case
at
bench
is
distinguishable
from
the
vast
majority
of
civil
cases.
fiscal
and
administrative
burdens
involved
do
not
justify
the
denial
of
such
fundamental
right.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
no.
mr.
leowen
evans
well,
mr.
justice,
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
vast
majority
of
civil
cases
under--
mr.
leowen
evans
--well,
this
court
has
recognized,
mr.
justice,
that
the
right
to
integrity
of
the
family
unit
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
a
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
liberty
interest.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
that,
mr.
justice,
on
the
weight
of
the
liberty
interest
involved.
mr.
leowen
evans
the
right
to
one's
children,
the
right
to
keep
one's
relationship
intact
with
his
child
is
more
fundamental
than
property
interests.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
right
to
integrity
of
the
family
unit
is
far
more
precious
than
property
rights,
comes
that...
this
right
comes
to
the
court
with
more
respect
than
those
liberties
arrived
from
strictly
economic
arrangements.
lower
courts
have
recognized
that
the
integrity
of
the
parent
child
relationship
may
be
more
precious
than
freedom
from
bodily
restraint.
even
some
lower
courts
have
recognized
that
the
right
to
integrity
of
the
parent
child
relationship
is
more
precious
than
the
right
to
life
itself.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
liberty
interests
are
more
fundamental
than
property
interests.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
right.
and
stanley
said
expressly
that
the
liberty
interest
involved
there
was
far
more
precious
than
property
rights,
and
was
more
precious
than
those
liberty
interests
derived
from
shifting
the
economic
arrangements.
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
a
per
se
need
for
appointed
counsel.
they
justify
this
position
on
the
fact
that
inherent
risk
cause
erroneous
terminations
in
such
cases.
these
inherent
risks
are
that
the
poor
be
overborne
by
the
resources
of
the
state,
that
the
final
decision
terminating
parental
rights
will
be
based
on
incompetent
and
inadmissible
evidence.
thirdly,
that
existing
procedural
safeguards
will
be
lost,
and
fourthly,
that
crucial
factual
disputes
and
complex
issues
will
go
unresolved.
the
case
at
bench
is
certainly
illustrative
of
each
of
these
inherent
risks.
mr.
leowen
evans
the...
not
in
every
civil
case,
mr.
justice.
in
the
majority
of
civil
cases,
you
have
private
party
initiating
and
prosecuting
the
action.
however,
in
the
case
at
bench,
we
have
the
state
initiating
and
prosecuting
the
action.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
that
situation
you
do
have
the
state
acting.
and
you
may
well
have
to
look
to
other
aspects
of
this
case
for
distinction,
distinguishing
this
case
from
that
case.
now,
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
the
vast
majority
of
civil
cases
under
each
prong
of
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
analysis.
under
the
first
prong,
the--
mr.
leowen
evans
--in
north
carolina,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
so.
the
initiation
of
the
action
by
a
private
party
there
would
be
the
only
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case.
in
a
foster
parent
case
you
would
have
the
state
having
a
substantial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
you
would
have
the
state
having
a
parens
patriae
duty
to
protect
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
family,
and
indeed
you
would
have,
if
there's
an
answer
filed
in
that
case,
if
the
indigent
parent
files
an
answer
in
that
case,
you
would
have
the
state
appointing
counsel
to
represent
the
child.
so
in
essence
you
would
have
a
possibility
of
the
very
same
case
here.
an
attorney
for
the
child
could
very
well
be
the
adversary
to
the
parent
rather
than
an
attorney
for
the
state.
in
distinguishing
this
case
from
the
vast
majority
of
civil
cases,
under
each
prong
of
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
analysis
we
can
distinguish
this
case.
the
first
prong
of
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
analysis
is
the
protectable
interest
implicated
by
the
governmental
action.
we've
already
discussed
that
this
case
deals
with
the
government
initiating
and
prosecuting
an
action.
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
we
simply
do
not
have
that.
this
case
deals
with
a
basic
human
right,
the
right
to
integrity
of
the
parent
child
relationship.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
so.
mr.
leowen
evans
i
think
that
my
argument
that
this
case
would
be
distinguished
from
those
cases
would
apply.
mr.
leowen
evans
again,
the
interest
that
is
implicated.
in
that
case--
mr.
leowen
evans
--i
would
think
that
it
could
be
either,
but
it
would
be
distinguishable
from
this
case
on
the
weight
of
the
interest
involved.
this
case
deals
with
perhaps
the
most
basic
right
known
to
man.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice,
and
perhaps
in
future
cases
this
court
may
weigh
the
factors
involved
and
decide
that
that
should
be
protected.
mr.
leowen
evans
i
would
certainly
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
face
up
to
it
but
the
court
definitely
can
distinguish
this
case
from
those
cases.
it
would
not
be
automatic.
mr.
leowen
evans
mr.
justice,
certainly
i
think
the
child
should
be
represented
in
these
cases.
however,
i
am
not
sure
as
to
whether
this
court--
mr.
leowen
evans
--pardon?
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
the
reason
that
a
public
counsel
was
granted,
need
to
be
granted
in
these
cases,
is
that
there's
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts,
that
needs
to
be
protected.
now,
i
recognize
the--
mr.
leowen
evans
--yes,
but
this
court
has
not
recognized
as
of
yet,
mr.
justice,
that
the
child
has
a
constitutionally
protected
right
in
the
integrity
of
the
family.
and
that
is
a
point
of
distinction.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
state
of
north
carolina
does
grant--
mr.
leowen
evans
--okay.
the
new
stat?
the
joint
appendix
on
page
20
or
the
brief?
mr.
leowen
evans
okay.
that
statute
says,
mr.
justice,
that
in
abuse
and
neglect
and
dependency
cases,
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
will
be
granted
to
indigent
parents.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice,
it
does.
mr.
leowen
evans
well,
mr.
justice,
it--
mr.
leowen
evans
--i
think
it
shows
that...
a
basic
inconsistency.
the
recognizing
of
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
for
parents,
indigent
parents,
in
abuse,
neglect,
and
dependency
cases
in
which
the
parental
rights
is
faced
with
a
temporary
removal,
but
not
recognizing
the
same
right
in
a
case
in
which
the
parental
rights
is
faced
with
a
total
severance,
certainly
is
inconsistent.
mr.
leowen
evans
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
there
may
even
be
an
equal
protection
argument.
we
do
not
reach
that
today.
the
argument
that
we
have
made
today
is
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
appointment
of
counsel
in
these
cases.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
an
action
that's
filed
in
juvenile
court.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
i
think
this--
mr.
leowen
evans
--yes,
the
action
was
filed
by
a
juvenile,
or
juvenile--
mr.
leowen
evans
--well,
this
statute
was
passed
after
the
case
at
bench.
mr.
leowen
evans
right.
and
it
applies
only
in
abuse,
neglect,
and
dependency
cases.
this
is
a
termination
case.
mr.
leowen
evans
and
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
right
to
retain
counsel
was
granted
at
those
proceedings,
are
granted
at
those
proceedings.
all
parties
involved
have
a
compelling
reason
to
prevent
the
erroneous
deprivations
of
parental
rights.
the
parent
has
a
compelling
interest
of
preventing
a
denial
of
her
right
to
care,
custody,
and
companionship
to
her
child.
she
has
the
compelling
interest
of
maintaining
the
right
to
transfer
cultural
or
religious
and
political
values
to
the
next
generation.
the
child
loses
his
right
to
receive
care,
custody,
and
companionship
and
love
from
his
mother,
from
his
brothers
and
sisters,
and
from
his
grandparents.
the
child
also
loses
the
right
to
receive
its
cultural,
religious,
and
political
heritage,
or
the
cultural,
religious,
and
political
heritage
of
his
people.
mr.
leowen
evans
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
i
think
a
guardian
ad
litem
should
be
appointed,
mr.
justice,
but
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
leowen
evans
--no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
the
right
should
certainly
be
protected,
but
first
the
court
would
have
to
recognize
that
the
child's
right
to
integrity
of
the
family
unit
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
and
as
of
this
point
the
court
hasn't
recognized
that.
society...
the
state
has
a
substantial
interest
in
preventing
erroneous
deprivations
also.
the
state
has
the
parens
patriae
duty
to
protect
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
the
best
interests
of
children
simply
are
not
protected
by
allowing
erroneous
deprivations
of
parental
rights.
the
state
has
a
substantial
interest
in
protecting
the
family
unit.
the
family
unit
is
responsible
for
transferring
sacred
societal
values
such
as
morals,
cultural
beliefs,
and
political
values.
the
state
cannot
transfer
these
values
and
once
the
child
is
placed
into
foster
case,
then
the
state
is
confronted
with
the
problem
of,
how
do
we
prepare
this
child
for
his
future
obligations,
such
as
these
sacred
values
that
are
needed
for
a
well
rounded
child
in
our
society?
mr.
leowen
evans
next
year,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
well,
mr.
justice,
there
is
the
grandmother
in
this
case,
who
appeared
at
the
termination
of
parental
rights
hearing,
stated
that
she
was
willing
to
take
this
child
and
take
care
of
the
child.
she
is
presently
taking
care
of
petitioner's
other
four
children,
and
certainly
the...
if
the
state
had
placed
this
child
with
the
grandmother,
then
this
child's
parent
child
relationship
could
have
remained
intact.
this
child's--
mr.
leowen
evans
--but
this?
that
is
in
the
trial
transcript.
mr.
leowen
evans
it
is
lodged.
mr.
leowen
evans
the
mother,
mr.
justice.
the
state
alleged
that
the
mother
did
not
make
a
constructive
plan
for
the
future
of
her
child.
this
indigent
imprisoned
mother
made
perhaps
the
only
plan.
she
asked
that
her
child
be
placed
with
a
member
of
the
extended
family.
an
indigent
imprisoned
person
cannot
make
any
other
plans,
and
must
look
to
the
family,
its
family,
to
help
her.
and
this
plan
would
have
been
the
most
constructive
plan
for
everybody
involved.
it
would
have
kept
the
parent
child
relationship
intact;
this
lady
is
getting
out
in
a
year;
she
can
come
home
to
her
family.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes.
mr.
leowen
evans
well,
mr.
justice,
that
aspect
of
the
case
is
before
the
court
from
the
perspective
that
the
parent
in
this
case
lost
certain
procedural
due
process
rights.
she
lost
her
right
to
be
able
to
present
favorable
evidence.
she
had
favorable
defenses
to
present
in
this
case.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
there
are
three
basic
defenses
that
she
had
had
that
were
meritorious,
that
certainly
counsel
could
have
presented
for
her.
mr.
leowen
evans
she
was
brought
to
the
hearing,
mr.
justice.
yet
she
was
unable
to
cross
examine
the
social
worker
that
testified
against
her.
the
trial
transcript
indicates
that
she
continually
tried
to
testify
while
she
was
supposed
to
be
cross
examining.
the
juvenile
court
continually
admonished
her
to
stop
doing
so,
and
finally
she
gave
up
her
efforts
to
cross
examine.
in
the
process
she
also
gave
up
her
right
to
contest
the
veracity
of
this
proceedings.
mr.
justice,
i
see
that
i
have
five
minutes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leowen
evans
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
there
are
several
points
i
wanted
to
address
that
the
court
raised.
the
first
is,
drawing
a
line.
this
case
is
certainly
distinguishable
from
the
majority
of
civil
cases.
this
case
is
formal
and
complex;
adversarial...
not
informal.
the
full
panoply
of
evidentiary
rules
apply.
the
full
panoply
of
procedural
safeguards
apply.
a
formal
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
must
be
made.
it's
judicial,
not
administrative;
governmentally
initiated,
prosecuted,
and
financed.
the
records
that
are
used
and
the
testimony
that
are
used
in
these
cases
often
involve
testimony
by
a
paid

a
paid
state
agent.
likewise,
you
can
look
to
each
of
the
prongs
of
mathews
to
find
points
of
distinction.
under
the
first
point,
state
initiated,
state
prosecuted,
the
fundamentalness
of
the
interests.
under
the
governmental
interest
involved
we
have
the
government
moving
as
a
party,
we
have
the
government
having
a
substantial
parens
patriae
interest.
we
just
don't
have
that
in
other
cases.
under
the
third
prong
of
mathews
v.
eldridge
we
have
the
government
overbearing
the
indigent
parent
by
his
resources
and
advocacy
skills.
in
the
vast
majority
of
civil
cases,
we
simply
just
do
not
have
that.
mr.
leowen

no,

amendment

stewart.
as
far
as
the
questions
as
to
what
effort
this
parent...
these...
the
family
made
towards
obtaining
this
child
after
the
child
went
into
foster
care,
at
the
very
outset
the
grandmother
asked
the
department
of
social
services
to
place
the
child
with
her.
the
mother
wanted
the
child
to
be
placed
with
her.
you
can
find
reference
to
this
request
in
the
trial
transcript
at
page
52.
mr.
leowen
evans
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
was
an
allegation
by
the
social
worker
that
she
said
that
she
could
not
take
care
of
the
child,
that
members
of
her
church
said
that
she
could
not
take
care
of
the
child.
however,
at
the
trial
the
grandmother
testified
that
she
never
made
such
statements
and
indeed,
that
she
never
would
make
such
statements,
because
these
five
children
involved
are
her
only
grandchildren.
she
has
four
children.
petitioner
is
the
only
child
that
has
children,
and
she
said
that
this
is
my
only
family
and
there's
no
way
that
i
would
give
up
that
right.
likewise,
in
reference
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
about
diligent
effort,
the
department
of
social
services
did
not
make
a
diligent
effort
in
this
case
to
try
to
strengthen
the
parent
child
relationship.
the
department
made
only
one
visit
to
this
parent
during
the
two
years
in
issue,
one
visit.
this
visit
was
made
three
months
prior
to
filing
a
termination
of
parental
rights
petition,
and
the
visit
was
made
for
the
express
purpose
to
ask
the
parent
to
give
up
her
parent
child
relationship.
two
years,
one
visit,
asking
the
parent
to
give
up
the
parent
child
relationship,
certainly
cannot
be
classified
as
a
diligent
effort
to
strengthen
the
parent
child
relationship.
in
reference
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
questions
about
abuse
and
neglect,
abuse
and
neglect
are
grounds
for
termination
of
parental
rights
in
north
carolina.
so
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
prior
adjudication
in
which
the
child
is
actually
put
into
the
custody
of
dss,
of
department
of
social
services,
and
be
any
subsequent
termination
action
under
certain
situations--
mr.
leowen
evans
--yes.
thank
you.
