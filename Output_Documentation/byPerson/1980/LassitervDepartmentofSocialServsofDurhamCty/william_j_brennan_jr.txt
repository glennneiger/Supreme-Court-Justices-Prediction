justice
jr.
has
the
court
required
appointed
counsel
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
as
a
constitutional
requirement?
justice
jr.
well,
suppose,
mr.
evans,
you
had
a
profession
that
required
a
state
license
in
order
to
practice,
and
a
proceeding
was
brought
to
revoke,
by
the
state,
to
revoke
the
practitioner's
license
and
he
were
indigent.
would
your
argument
today
apply
in
this
case
also?
justice
jr.
you
think
so?
justice
jr.
on
what
ground
would
you
distinguish
it?
justice
jr.
that
certainly
would
be...
a
license,
what
would
it
be?
a
property
interest,
a
liberty
interest,
or
both?
justice
jr.
well,
here's
a
man
about
to
lose
his
livelihood.
he
may
no
longer
practice
his
profession.
isn't
that
a
rather
significant
interest?
justice
jr.
well,
then
you
do
concede
that
if
we
agree
with
you
in
this
case,
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
contain
it
out
of
the
principle
to
this
kind
of
case.
we're
going
to
have
to
face
up
to
it
in
a
lot
of
other
types
of
cases,
aren't
we?
justice
jr.
what's
the
reach
of
this
statute,
mr.
evans?
what
is
a
juvenile
petition?
what's
that
refer
to?
a
particular
kind
of
proceeding
or
something?
justice
jr.
and
which
is
not
this
case?
justice
jr.
in
this
case?
was
this
case
brought
by
something
called
juvenile
petition?
justice
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
why
doesn't
this
statute
apply
then,
as
my
brother
marshall
suggested?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know
but,
why
shouldn't
we
send
it
back
and
ask
your
state
courts
to
look
at
the
case
in
light
of
that
statute?
justice
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
jr.
so
this
is
limited,
then?
justice
jr.
this
statute
quite
definitely
does
not
apply
in
that
proceeding?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
odom,
do
i
understand
that
presently,
under
your
present
law,
there
could
not
be
a
termination
proceeding
until
there
had
first
been
a
custody
proceeding
at
which
the
custody
was
turned
over
to
a
state
agency?
justice
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
jr.
all
right.
but
now,
under
your
present
regime,
under
this
new
statute,
the
mother
would
have
had
counsel
at
the
custody
proceeding?
justice
jr.
and,
at
least
she'd
have
had
counsel
there?
justice
jr.
and
she
might
have
prevailed
against
the
award
of
custody
to
the
state
agency,
which
would
have
meant
there
would
never
be
a
termination
proceeding.
is
that
correct?
justice
jr.
at
least
one
initiated
by
the
state
agency.
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
well,
then,
there
is
some
connection
between
this
new
statute
and
this
case,
isn't
there?
justice
jr.
later
in
the
termination
proceeding?
justice
jr.
then,
i
do
suggest
there's
some
relevance
of
this
new
statute
to
this
case.
justice
jr.
mr.
odom,
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
i
think
you
told
me
earlier,
did
you
not,
that
under
the
present
regime
the
custody
aspect
calls
for
counsel
by
statute,
now
must
be
provided?
justice
jr.
if
that
results
in
the
transfer
of
custody
to
a
state
agency,
which
then
initiates
a
proceeding
to
terminate
the
parental
relationship,
then
counsel
as
a
matter
of
practice,
even
though
the
statute
doesn't
require
it,
is
provided
at
the
termination
hearing
also?
justice
jr.
does
the
court...
is
the
practice
in
fact
to
do
it?
justice
jr.
has
there
been
any
effort
to
have
the
legislature
address
it?
i
just
wonder,
why
the
distinction
between
the
custody
and
the
termination
procedures?
justice
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
anyway,
mr.
shaber,
your
legislature
has
never
expressly
addressed
the
question,
why
not
also
counsel
at
the
termination
hearing?
justice
jr.
i
see.
