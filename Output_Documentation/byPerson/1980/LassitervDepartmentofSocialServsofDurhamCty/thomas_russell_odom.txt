mr.
thomas
russell
odom
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
under
north
carolina
law
there
are
two
different
proceedings
by
which
the
department
of
social
services
makes
an
effort
to
address
family
problems.
the
statute
provides,
the
statutory
scheme
provides
that
the
department
of
social
services
must
investigate
and
to
the
extent
necessary
intervene
in
those
cases
where
parents
can
no
longer
be
presumed
to
be
giving
proper
care
and
supervision
to
their
children.
those
cases
i
will
denominate
custody
cases
which
in
addressing
the
statute
that
was
called
into
question
a
few
minutes
ago
i
will
also
call
abuse,
neglect,
and
dependency
proceedings.
it
is
this
proceeding
which
represents
the
initial
intrusion
into
the
family
unit,
into
what
mr.
evans
would
call
the
family
integrity.
the
child
is
still
with
the
parents,
the
parents
are
presumed,
as
they
are
entitled
to,
to
be
providing
proper
care
and
supervision.
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
department
of
social
services
that
they
are
not,
and
the
department
brings
this
action
to
court.
because
it
is
the
initial
and
most,
i
would
argue,
significant
intrusion
into
the
family
unit,
the
legislature
of
north
carolina
has
provided
that
both
the
parent
and
the
child
be
provided
with
an
attorney
if
they
cannot
afford
one.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
you
asked
about
earlier.
now,
there
is
a
different
statutory
scheme
in
north
carolina
for
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
that
is
a
totally
separate
proceeding
from
the
abuse,
neglect,
dependency
custody
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
at
the
initial
custody
hearing,
if
the
court
determines
that
the
child
is
to
be
removed
and
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
department
of
social
services,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case
in
may
of
1975,
the
department's
interest
tends
to
shift
very
subtly
from
that
of
parens
patriae
to
in
loco
parentis.
the
court
has
given
the
department
of
social
services
certain
responsibilities
in
providing
for
the
interests
of
this
individual
child.
there
are
provisions
in
the
law
that
are
being
refined
constantly
by
which
the
court
can
direct
both
the
parents
and
the
department
of
social
services
to
work
together
to
try
to
reunify
this
family,
to
put
the
child
back
into
the
home.
there
are
provisions
in
the
law
now
that
require
that
the
custody
decision
that
removed
the
child
be
reviewed
every
six
months
to
make
sure
that
the
court's
mandate
is
being
followed.
now,
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
that
statutory
provision
has
been
enacted
subsequent
to
this.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
family,
once
the
child
was
removed
from
the
home,
the
family
abandoned
this
child,
in
foster
care.
the
mother
testified
that
she
had
seen
him
once
or
twice,
she
had
in
fact
visited
with
him
once
at
the
request
of
the
social
worker,
but
she
had
not
seen
him
any
other
time.
and
there
was
a
period
of
more
than
a
year
from
the
time
that
the
child
was
in
fact
removed
from
her
custody
until
she
went
into
prison,
at
which
time
or
during
which
time
you
could
presume
that
she
had
the
freedom
to
make
some
contest
or
some--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir.
it
was...
well,
this
record
was
before,
the
initial
custody
proceeding
was
tried
before
this
very
judge
who
looked
back
through
the
file
and
made
a
determination
that--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--yes,
sir.
the
juvenile--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--he
has
the
right
under
north
carolina
law.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
he
could
have
contested
it
but
it
would
have
been
a
fruitless
contest
under
north
carolina
law.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
well,
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
argue
the
ineffectiveness
of
lawyers,
but
i'm
saying
that
the
statutory
scheme
on
balance
would
make
their
effectiveness
in
this
kind
of
proceeding
minimal,
as
compared
to
the
state's
interest
in
not
requiring
by
statute
that
they
be
appointed.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
the
department
of
social
services
cannot
initiate--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--until
they
had
in
fact
been
given
custody
by
a
court's--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
many
judges
tend
to...
if
in
fact,
this
case
arose
after
the
effective
date
of
that
statute
in
january
of
1980,
the
court
will
continue
the
appointment
of
counsel
so
that
if
in
fact
the
child
is
removed
at
a
hearing
at
which
the
parent
was
represented,
that
the
parent
will
have
the
benefit
of
continued--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--if
in
fact
it
comes
up
in
a
termination
court--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--it
can
be
construed
in
that
fashion
subsequent
to
the
effective
date,
but
of
course
this
all
started
before
then.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
happened--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--he
did
under
the
old
statute,
and
i'll
explain
why.
the
department,
as
i
pointed
out,
takes
on
the
role
of
in
loco
parentis,
the
parent
role
to
the
child,
and
is
therefore
presumed
to
be
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
in
the
majority
of
these
cases
in
the
index
to
our
brief
we
try
to
point
out
some
statistics
that
we
were
able
to
find...
that
in
the
majority
of
these
cases
the
department
has
long
since
exhausted
all
other
alternatives
for
reuniting
the
family,
and
that
by
the
time
they
bring
this
action
that
is
a
hopeless
cause.
in
only
two
cases
out
of
768
did
the
court
find
in
a
termination
action
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
termination.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
but
there
was
conflicting
testimony,
mr.
justice
marshall,
to
the
effect
that
the
grandmother
had
in
fact
told
the
case
worker
in
discussions
about
that,
that
she
couldn't
take
care
of
the
child.
there
was
a
flat
out
contradiction--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--that
is
correct.
but
the
distinction
here--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--i
think
if
you
could
understand
what
actually
happened
in
practice,
you
could
see
why
the
interest
of
the
state
in
not
doing
it
is
substantial
enough
to
not
require
it,
especially
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
what
generally
happens
as
a
result
of
the
child
being
removed
is
that
not
only
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--well,
also
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
the
uncontroverted
fact
that
the
woman
made
no
effort
to
see
the
child
after
he
was
removed
and--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--when
a
parent's
child,
when
this
woman's
child
was
removed
from
her,
had
she...
she
didn't
even
appear
at
the
custody
hearing
which
took
the
child
away
from
her.
that's
uncontroverted.
she
was
given
two
different
notices
of
that
hearing.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
it's
uncontested.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
it
is
understood
by
everyone
that
she
was
given
notice
of
the
original
hearing.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
all
right.
it's
in
the
trial
transcript,
the
fact
that
she
did
not
appear
and
was
given
notice
of
the--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--i'm
not
sure
under
north
carolina--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--that's
what
it
says;
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir,
that
was
the
comment--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--in
question
now.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
she
waived
her
right
to
appear
at
that
hearing
and
contest
the
removal
of
the
child
from
her,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
in
this
proceeding.
she...
well,
she
didn't
ask
for
help
in
this
proceeding.
what
she
said
was,
judge,
i've
been
talking
with
this
lawyer
about
post
conviction
proceedings
for
four
months.
give
me
some
time
to
go
talk
to
him.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
but
she
didn't
ask
the
court--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--she
was
brought
to
the
hearing.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
it
does.
keep
reading
on
down.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
but
it
says
that
she
stated
to
the
court...
and
she
had
to
be
present
to
the
court
to
state
it...
she
was
in
fact
brought
to
the
hearing,
but
she
didn't
ask--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--she
did
not
ask
for
an
appointed
counsel.
she
gave
testimony--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--she
was
but
she
was
brought
to
the
hearing.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
when
she
was
brought
to
the
hearing,
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
she
has
not
been
out
of
custody
since--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--she
had
a
lawyer.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
but
she
never
bothered
to
mention
to
it
to
him.
if
her
right
to
this
child
was
so
fundamental,
more
precious
than
the
right
to
life
itself,
it's
inconceivable
that
she
wouldn't
have
said--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--it's
retained
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
it's
inconceivable
that
she
could
not
have
at
least
mentioned
the
proceeding
to
him.
she--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--she
could
write.
she
could
write.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
she
obtained
one
through
her
mother
who--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--but
she
was
communicating
with
him,
and
the
big
issue
was
that
she
had...
and
the
point
to
be
made
from
this
is
that
if
she
in
fact
were
so
concerned--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--no,
sir,
i
never
did.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
but
she
did
say
that
she
had
never
mentioned
this
proceeding
to
him
but
had
been
communicating
with
him
throughout.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
no,
sir,
and
we
would
not
purport
to
even
argue
that.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes.
i
would--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--i'm
not
arguing
that
counsel
would
not
have
been
effective
in
perhaps
presenting
testimony
to
the
court.
i
am
saying
that
under
the
facts
of
the
case
this
decision
that
was
made
in
the
trial
court
was
correct.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
it's
possible,
i
suppose,
that
the
legislature
could
do
that,
but
i
think
it
would
fly
in
the
face
of
an
inherent
presumption
that
in
any
kind
of
legal
action
that
was
in
fact
brought
in
a
court
of
law,
a
person
is
entitled
to
appear
by
retained
counsel.
now--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
one
that
would
be
given
a
great
deal
of
attention.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
what
would
happen,
i
think,
what
would
happen,
the
legislature
could
do,
in
north
carolina,
it
could
create
an
administrative
body
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
department
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
woman's
rights
to
the
child
would
be
totally
and
permanently
severed.
but
they
chose
not
to
do
that.
they
chose
to
make
it,
in
fact,
a
judicial
proceeding
to
take
out
of
the
hands
of
the
department
of
social
services
the
right
to
make
that
determination,
and
they
did
that
because
of
the
recognition
of
the
legislature
of
the
importance
of
the
family
right.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
the
court
tends
to
extend
the
appointment
of
counsel--
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
--my
experience
has
been
that
some
judges
do
and
some
judges
don't.
there
is
some
discrepancy
from
judicial
district
to
judicial
district.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
it
does.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
it
shows
that
she
contacted
the
mother
and
discussed
with
her
the
idea
of
perhaps
giving
the
child
up
for
adoption
or
terminating
her
rights
or
asking
her
what
she
wanted
to
do
with
the
child,
and
all
she
said
was,
i
want
the
child
to
live
with
my
mother.
the
social
worker
then
contacted
the
mother
and...
at
least
the
transcript...
this
particular
record
does
not,
but
mr.
evans
had
the
transcript
lodged
with
the
court...
shows
that
the
worker
says
she
contacted
the
grandmother
on
several
occasions
and
was
told
by
the
grandmother,
i
can't
take
care
of
the
child.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
that's
what
the
transcript
says;
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
no,
sir,
that
was
prior
to
her
going
to
jail.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
i
thought
you
had
asked
me
a
question.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
immediately
preceding.
but
the
first
year
after
the
child
was
removed
from
her
custody,
she
was
not
in
jail,
for
in
fact,
for
some
13
or
14
months
after
he
was
removed
and
placed
in
a
foster
home,
she
was
not
in
jail,
she
was
out
on
the
street.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
what
the
transcript
shows
is
that
she
hadn't
seen
him
at
all
since
he
had
been
removed,
but
two
or
three
times,
those
occurring
when,
in
fact,
she
was
out
on
the
street.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
in
fact,
though,
the
petition
was
brought
on
two
grounds
and
the
court
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law
that
she
had
failed
to
maintain
concern
or
responsibility
as
to
the
child's
welfare.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
fact
that
a
parent
is
in
prison
does
not
prevent
them
from
maintaining
concern
or
responsibility
as
to
the
child's
welfare.
and
she
had
made
no
effort
to
do
that.
now,
i
wouldn't
argue
that
it
would
have
prevented
a
finding
that
she
had
willfully
abandoned
him,
and
that
was
not
alleged
in
this
case.
i
think,
in
trying
to
sum
up,
the
obverse
of
the
problem
that
we're
struggling
with
is,
if
this
court
requires
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
a
civil
action
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
court
will
be
hard
pressed
to
limit
it
and
will
be
placed
in
the
position,
from
here
on,
of
making
a
determination
as
to
what
right
is
most
fundamental
enough
to
require
it,
and
those
that
are
not
fundamental
enough
to
require
it.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
russell
odom
thank
you.
