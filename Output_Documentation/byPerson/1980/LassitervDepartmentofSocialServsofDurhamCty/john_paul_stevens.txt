justice
stevens
mr.
evans,
you're
arguing
the
right
of
the
child,
right
now.
was
there
a
guardian
ad
litem
in
this
case?
there
was
not,
was
there?
justice
stevens
would
that
also
be
constitutional
error,
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
you
think
the
constitution
requires...
in
other
words,
is
it
a
necessary
consequence
of
agreeing
with
you
that
we
should
appoint
two
lawyers
in
every
parental
termination
case?
justice
stevens
well,
why
not?
because,
why
isn't
the
child's
interest
that
you're
just
arguing
now,
also
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
and
be
sure
that
there
aren't
arguments
with
regard
to
the
child's
interest
that
are
possibly
conflicting
with
the
parents
that
might
be
overlooked
in
the
proceeding?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
odom,
when
a
lawyer
is
appointed
pursuant
to
the
new
statute
and
for
an
indigent,
which,
as
the
statute
requires,
is
that
lawyer
paid
by
the
state?
justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt?
why
isn't
the
same
conflict
present
at
the
termination
hearing?
justice
stevens
it's
kind
of
ironic,
because
at
the
first
hearing
it
has
a
greater
interest
in
the
parent's
side
of
the
potential
controversy
and
yet
the
parent
has
an
independent
right
to
counsel.
at
the
second
hearing
nobody
speaks
for
the
parent
except
a
parent
who,
presumably,
sometimes
cannot
do
so
effectively.
justice
stevens
but
there
are
very
few
civil
situations
in
which
a
state
sues
indigent
litigants.
justice
stevens
by
hypothesis,
somebody
who
owns
a
lot
of
real
estate
normally
is
not
indigent.
justice
stevens
is
it
also
true
that
there
are
a
great
many
more
custody
hearings
than
there
are
termination
hearings?
justice
stevens
so
the
legislature
might
have
been
more
aware
of
the
problem
there?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
american
bar
association
has
taken
the
position
it
does
in
this
litigation
because
it's
looking
to
the
long
run
best
interest
of
employment
for
lawyers?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
this
may
have
an
impact
on
the
small
claims
courts
in
the
states
where
they
preclude
any
lawyers,
along
the
lines
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
suggestion?
