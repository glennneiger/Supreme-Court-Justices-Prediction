justice
stewart
gault,
the
gault
case?
justice
stewart
and
the
state,
at
least,
denominated
that
a
noncriminal
proceeding.
justice
stewart
no.
the
answer
is,
no.
justice
stewart
well,
now,
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
you
say
that
the
constitution
protects
family
integrity?
justice
stewart
and
while
you
may
or
may
not
be
right,
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
explicit
words
of
the
constitution
that
do
protect
that.
justice
stewart
but
the
constitution
explicitly
protects
a
person
from
being
deprived
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law,
and
that's
what
happens
in
the
mine
run,
run
of
the
mill
civil
case
if
the
defendant
loses.
he
is
deprived
of
his
property,
some
of
his
property,
if
there's
a
judgment
against
him
for
money.
and
therefore,
why
doesn't
your
argument
apply
in
spades
to
every
civil
case?
justice
stewart
only
in
that
this
one
does
not
involve
something
explicitly
protected
by
the
constitution.
justice
stewart
well,
but
the...
and
that's
by
judicial
decision
of
this
court,
assuming
you're
correct.
justice
stewart
but
the
constitution
literally
and
explicitly
protects
somebody
from
losing
his
property
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
stewart
so
why
isn't
that
an
a
fortiori
case?
an
ordinary
run
of
the
mill
civil
case?
justice
stewart
you
think
that
something
that
this
court
has
dreamed
up
is
more
weighty
than
something
that's
in
the
constitution
itself?
justice
stewart
well,
that
has
to
be
your
argument,
i
expect,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
the
inference
is
that
had
she
been
represented
by
counsel
those
rights
would
have
been
preserved
and
not
lost?
justice
stewart
and
the
decision
would
have
been
right
and
not
wrong?
justice
stewart
under
the
new
statute,
that's
correct?
in
a
custody
proceeding?
justice
stewart
and
typically,
as
in
this
case,
a
termination
proceeding
takes
place
only
after
there
has
been
a
loss
by
the
parent
of
custody?
justice
stewart
although
it's
not
necessarily
so
in
all
situations?
justice
stewart
then
it
is
necessarily
so?
justice
stewart
that
was
what
you
said
in
answer
to
my
brother
brennan
earlier.
justice
stewart
but
there
are
some
situations
in
which
there
can
be
a
termination
hearing
without
an
antecedent
custody
proceeding.
justice
stewart
not
when
they're
brought--
justice
stewart
--but
they're
very
rare?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
his
wife
married
somebody
else?
justice
stewart
his
former
wife?
justice
stewart
and
yet
it's
not
your
contention
that
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution,
is
it?
justice
stewart
and
that's
the
line
that
the
constitution
draws,
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
justice
stewart
which
guarantees
counsel
in
all
criminal
prosecutions?
