before
we
leave
that,
mr.
evans,
is
it
not
inherent
in
the
rationale
of
the
gault
and
the
other
cases
that
because
the
juvenile
proceeding
was
so
nearly
a
criminal
proceeding,
that
the
criminal
safeguards
in
various
respects
had
to
be
incorporated?
isn't
that
the
rationale?
chief
justice
burger
--isn't
each
of
those
characteristics
present
in
the
civil
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
putting
to
you?
is
that
not
a
potential
in
every
civil
case?
chief
justice
burger
and
you're
making
an
equal
protection
argument
there?
this
is
the
choice
of
the
legislature,
to
provide
counsel
in
that
situation.
now,
are
you
suggesting
it's
going
to
have
unequal
protection,
not
to
supply
it
here?
chief
justice
burger
well,
now
you're
addressing
the
proposition
that
the
decision
of
the
court
was
wrong.
it
made
a
bad
and
unwise
decision.
chief
justice
burger
that's
not
before
us,
is
it?
chief
justice

did
they
allow
her...
was
she
paroled

explain
to

how
