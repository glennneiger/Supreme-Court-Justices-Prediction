justice
marshall
didn't
stanley
v.
illinois
say
just
that?
justice
marshall
that
there
was
a
liberty
interest
in
keeping
the
family
together?
justice
marshall
stanley
said
that--
justice
marshall
mr.
evans,
hasn't
the
state
of
north
carolina
already
recognized
that
and
passed
a
statute
giving
counsel
in
juvenile
hearings?
justice
marshall
so
they
do
recognize
that
where
you're
taking
children
from
the
parents,
in
some
instances
you're
entitled
to
counsel?
justice
marshall
but
what
effect
does
that
have
on
this
case?
justice
marshall
if
any?
justice
marshall
mr.
evans,
when
will
this
woman,
the
mother,
be
eligible
for
parole?
justice
marshall
next
year.
i
was
wondering,
you
were
talking
about
the
family
unit.
there
is
no
family
unit
now.
justice
marshall
that's
all
in
the
record?
justice
marshall
so
there
is
in
the
transcript,
and
it's
lodged
here.
justice
marshall
thank
you.
so,
who
is
it
that
should
have
the
appointed
counsel?
the
grandmother
or
the
mother
here?
justice
marshall
this
was
testimony
at
the
hearing?
justice
marshall
without
a
lawyer?
justice
marshall
did
he
have
a
right
to
do
that?
justice
marshall
well,
was
anybody
there
to
contest
whether
he
had
that
right?
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean...
what
did
the...
could
a
lawyer
contest
that?
justice
marshall
well,
then
it's
your
point
it
wouldn't
do
them
any
good
to
have
had
a
lawyer
anyhow.
i
hope
you're
not
arguing
that.
justice
marshall
but
in
this
case
there
was
testimony
that
the
grandmother
wanted
the
child?
justice
marshall
well,
one
thing,
as
i
understand
it,
is
north
carolina
says
you
need
two
counsel,
one
for
the
child
and
one
for
the
parent
in
a
temporary
procedure.
but
you
don't
need
any
for
a
permanent
procedure?
justice
marshall
what
else
do
i
need
to
rule
against
you
than
that?
justice
marshall
well,
what
can
i
do
generally?
i
don't
have
the
slightest
idea
what
generally
happens
in
north
carolina,
but
i
do
have
a
record
of
this
case.
justice
marshall
and
it's
also
in
this
record,
uncontroverted,
that
she
didn't
have
counsel
who
could
have
told
her
that.
justice
marshall
what
do
you
mean,
uncontroverted?
justice
marshall
well,
how
can
she
contest
without
a
lawyer?
justice
marshall
well,
it's
not
to
me,
unless
you
show
it
to
me
in
the
record.
justice
marshall
well,
on
page
16
of
that
same
record,
appendix,
narrative
of
testimony,
"although
respondent
stated
to
the
court
that
she
had
informed
officials
at
the
north
carolina
correctional
center
for
women,
officials
at
that
institution.
"
--those
officials
"took
no
action
to
help
respondent
receive
the
assistance
of
legal
counsel.
"
is
that
correct?
justice
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
marshall
it
has
your
signature
on
it.
i
take
it
that
your
comment
was
directed
at
the
earlier
hearing?
justice
marshall
well,
then
you
say,
at
the
first
hearing
she
waived
this
future
hearing?
justice
marshall
well,
it
says
here
she
asked
for
help.
justice
marshall
did
she...
could
you
read
what,
hear
what
i
said.
she
asked
the
correctional
center.
justice
marshall
well,
she
wasn't
anyplace
else
but
in
jail.
she
wasn't
out
walking
down
the
street.
justice
marshall
this
doesn't
say
it
here.
justice
marshall
where
does
it
say
she
was
brought
to
the
hearing
on
that
paragraph?
i'm
talking
about
the
bottom
of
the
first
paragraph,
which
you
agreed
is
the
narrative
of
the
testimony.
justice
marshall
this
says
that--
justice
marshall
--now,
this
woman
was
in
jail?
justice
marshall
well,
was
she
in
custody?
justice
marshall
was
she
ever
out
of
custody?
justice
marshall
well,
how
could
she
get
a
lawyer
while
she
was
in
custody?
justice
marshall
for
her
criminal
affair.
justice
marshall
is
this
a
lawyer
of
her
own
choice
or
an
appointed
lawyer?
justice
marshall
yes.
and
he
was
retained
for
a
criminal
conviction.
does
this
lawyer
do
civil
practice?
justice
marshall
well,
where
do
i
find
that?
justice
marshall
to
me
it's
unimportant
whether
she
mentioned
to
"ab-ab".
the
point
was,
she
mentioned
it
to
the
authorities
and
she
couldn't
do
anything
without
the
permission
of
those
authorities
in
that
prison.
she
couldn't
do
anything
without
their
permission.
correct?
justice
marshall
well,
how
could
she
get
a
lawyer
by
writing?
justice
marshall
well,
where
is
he
in
this
case?
he
was
hired
for
one
deal,
not
for
two.
justice
marshall
did
you
at
the
hearing
ask
her
why
she
didn't
say
it?
justice
marshall
that's
your
answer.
so
i
don't
know,
because
you
didn't
give
me
the
information.
justice
marshall
she
needed
counsel.
don't
you
agree
she
needed
counsel?
justice
marshall
she...
well,
who
was
protecting
her
rights?
do
you
think
the
state,
in
respect
to
this
very
question,
do
you
think
the
state
could
have
prevented
her
from
having
counsel?
justice
marshall
at
least
two
times
you
said
that
she
saw...
only
two
times
in
the
year
she
saw
her
son?
was
that
the
time
she
was
in
jail?
justice
marshall
well,
i
was
reading
the
transcript
and
i
have
great
difficulty
with
it.
go
ahead.
i'm
going
to
finish
reading
this
transcript.
justice
marshall
yes,
that's
the
question
i
asked
you.
she
was
in
jail
the
year
before?
justice
marshall
but
the
record
says
she
was
in
jail.
at
that
time,
you
said,
she
didn't
see
him
for
the
first
year.
for
the
last
year
she
only
saw
him
twice.
justice
marshall
well,
i'll
take
a
look
at
it
and
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
justice
marshall
mr.
odom,
you
personally,
as...
what?
the
assistant
county
attorney?
justice
marshall
--was
assigned
to
this
case
and
you
were
there
from
the
beginning
to
the
end?
justice
marshall
thank
you.
