justice
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
gone,
counsel,
ever
gone
beyond
the
criminal
proceedings
in
requiring
states
to
appoint
counsel
in
particular
proceedings?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
evans,
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
do
you
think
this
court
is
free
to
say
that
one
is
more
important
than
the
other,
when
the
constitution
has
equated
them?
justice
rehnquist
what
about
a
state
condemnation
action,
where
the
state
initiates
an
action
to
condemn
so
much
of
your
property?
justice
rehnquist
with
respect
to
that
statute,
mr.
evans,
it
reads,
"in
cases
where
the
juvenile
petition
alleges
that
a
juvenile
is
abused,
neglected,
or
dependent,
the
parent
has
a
right
to
counsel
and
to
appointed
counsel
in
cases
of
indigency,
unless
the
parent
waives
the
right.
"
does
that
suggest
that
even
a
parent
who
could
retain
counsel
if
he
were
not
indigent,
or
she
were
not
indigent,
did
not
before
the
enactment
of
that
statute
have
the
right
to
appear
by
counsel?
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
at
those
proceedings
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
was
anybody
permitted
to
have
an
attorney?
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
the
child
have
a
right
to
counsel
too?
justice
rehnquist
well,
following
up
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
why
couldn't
the
state
say
that
neither
retained
nor
appointed
counsel
shall
represent
anybody
in
these
proceedings?
it's
too
destructive
of
the
family
relationship
to
have
every
incident
magnified
and
made
into
an
adversarial
situation,
so
that
we're
simply
going
to
conduct
these
hearing
without
any
lawyers,
because
we
think
lawyers
louse
up
families.
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
presumption
fostered
by
the
legal
profession,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
constitutional.
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
would
because
most
judges
are
lawyers.
