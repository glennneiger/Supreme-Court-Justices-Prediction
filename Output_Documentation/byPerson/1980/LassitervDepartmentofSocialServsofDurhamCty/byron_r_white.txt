well,
surely
your
rule
would
require
that
the
child
be
represented?
justice
white
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
fortiori.
justice
white
i
would
think
it
would
be
an
a
fortiori
argument,
at
least
the
parent
is
an
adult,
and
supposedly
capable
of
representing
himself.
i
suppose
guardians
ad
litem
are
really
appointed
because
the
child
is
a
minor.
is
that
right?
justice
white
but
your
argument,
i
would
think,
would
require
the
appointment
of
a
counsel
for
the
child.
justice
white
but
that
is
a
two
way
street,
the
integrity
of
the
parent
child
relationship.
justice
white
well,
certainly
if
there
was
a
relinquishment
proceeding,
where
the
parent
was
going
to
relinquish
the
child
to
the
state,
i
would
suppose
your
argument
would
be
that
the
child
would
have
to
be
represented?
well,
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
statute
says
on
page
20?
the
new
statute?
what
is
the
statute
in
the
joint
appendix?
the
joint
appendix
at
page
20.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
the
state
did,
would
it
be
unconstitutional
to
keep
her
retained
counsel
out
of
the
hearing?
justice
white
why?
she
doesn't
need
counsel.
