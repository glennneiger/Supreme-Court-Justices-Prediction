mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
perhaps
i
might
begin,
justice
rehnquist,
by
following
up
on
your
question
about
whether
or
not
the
state
could
dispense
with
counsel
altogether
in
these
hearings.
and
frankly,
sir,
i
think
not,
notwithstanding
parham
v.
j.r.
and
the
reason
i
think
not
is
that
the
degree
of
importance
that's
attached
to
the
family
relationship
in
stanley
v.
illinois
and
the
other
child
custody
cases
is
such
that
the
court
would
not
be
able
to
hold
that
counsel
could
be
barred
from
the
hearings.
justice
brennan,
you
asked
if
counsel
that
are
appointed
in
neglect
cases
carry
over?
mr.
odom
says
that
in
practice
they
sometimes
do.
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
state
that
they
necessarily
are
entitled
to
carry
over,
although
that
is
the
practice
of
many
state
district
court
judges.
the
question
simply
has
not
been
addressed
in
north
carolina
law.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
your
honor,
i
can
suggest
a
couple
of
possible
distinctions.
i
should
say
more
than
possible;
i
think
they
are
the
distinctions.
first
is
this,
that
the
intrusion
at
the
time
of
the
neglect
hearing
is
really
the
more
important
intrusion
because
that's
what
separates
a
child
from
the
parent
and
disrupts
the
care
and
companionship
of
the
child.
that's
what
really
sunders
the
family,
and
from
that
point
on
what
the
parent
has
is
not
an
interest
in
the
companionship
of
the
child
but
the
expectation
that
with
the
help
of
the
state
the
child
may
come
back
some
time
in
the
future.
that
interest
is
a
much
lower
interest.
the
second
point
is
this,
that
the
county
department
of
social
services
being
charged
with
this
obligation
to
try
and
restore
the
family,
and
having
this
obligation
not
only
from
the
time
of
the
neglect
hearing
on,
but
prior
to
the
neglect
hearing,
finds
itself
in
sort
of
a
conflict
of
interest
situation.
it's
supposed
to
protect
the
child
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
it's
supposed
to
try
and
put
the
family
back
together.
and
one
way
to
keep
the
county
department
of
social
services
out
of
trouble
given
this
inherent
conflict
in
its
responsibilities
is
to
appoint
an
attorney
for
the
child
and
an
attorney
for
the
parent,
and
that's
what
the
state
does.
the
third
point,
i
think,
is
that
very
often,
although
not
always,
the
neglect...
sir?
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
by
the
time
the
termination
hearing
comes
along,
justice
stevens,
the
county
department
of
social
services
has
made
a
decision
that
the
child
cannot
go
home
and
should
not
go
home.
it
no
longer
has
an
obligation
to
try
and
restore
that
family.
it
is
exclusively
concerned
with
trying
to
protect
the
best
interests
of
the
child
throughout
the
rest
of
its
life.
and
so
it's
not
divided;
it
no
longer
has--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--yes,
sir,
your
honor,
i
concede
the
irony
in
that,
and
i
would
nevertheless
suggest
that
the
reason
is
that
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
termination
action,
the
state's
interest
is
really
not
readily
distinguishable
from
the
interest
of
any
other
private
person
who
under
the
termination
statute
might
also
have
had
standing
to
bring
a
termination
of
parental
rights
action.
once
the
state...
it
settles
in
civil
cases
generally...
the
state
stands
as
a
private
litigant
and
may
bring
its
resources
to
bear
against
its
opponent.
and
when
you
eliminate
that
conflict
of
interest--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--your
honor,
proportionately,
yes,
but
in
fact
i
think
it's
not
uncommon.
condemnation
cases
would
be
a--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--your
honor,
i
do
a
lot
of
food
stamp
law
and
afdc
law,
and
i
find
a
lot
of
people
with
a
small
parcel
of
property
who
have
nothing
else,
and
their
prospect
would
be,
mortgage
the
property.
and
perhaps
they
couldn't
do
that
because
of
flaws
in
the
title
and
so
on,
or
don't
eat.
so,
i
think
that
there
are
indigent
persons
who
nonetheless
would
be
subject
to
a
property
condemnation
hearing.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
your
honor,
mr.
odom
includes
in
the
appendix
to
his
brief
two
bills
which
did
go
before
the
general
assembly
but
which
did
not
pass.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
i
ought
to
tell
the
court
at
this
juncture
that
i
have
also
drafted
a
bill
which
i
understand
will
be
submitted
at
this
session.
it
was
drafted
at
the
behest
of
certain
members
of
the
general
assembly.
whether
or
not
it
will
pass
i
do
not
know.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
very
many
more.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
yes,
sir,
that
is
a
possibility,
but
i
don't
know--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
your
honor,
i
think,
in
all
instances
where
the
government
would--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--it
is
necessarily
so.
because
the
county
department
of
social
services
first
has
to
get
custody--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--yes.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
not
when
they're
brought
by
the
county--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--yes,
sir;
when
they're
brought
by
private
parties.
i'm
sorry.
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
i
would
think
that
they're
on
the
order
of
50
or
60
a
year.
typically,
they
involve
stepparent
adoptions.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
if
i
might,
let
me
speak
very
briefly
to
the
prospect
that
this
decision
might
be
held
to
be
retroactive.
the
state
recognizes
that
it
is
asking
this
court
to
do
something
which
it
has
only
done
once
before,
and
that
was
in
morrissey
v.
brewer.
we
are
saying
that
if
the
petitioner
prevails
on
this
case,
we
would
like
language
in
the
opinion
such
as
is
in
morrissey
to
the
effect
that
it
is
wholly
prospective.
justice
stevens
saw
fit
to
speak
to
the
question
of
retroactive
and
prospective
application
in
caban
v.
mohammed.
justice
frankfurter
did
the
same
in
his
separate
opinion
in
griffin
v.
illinois.
we
think
that
this
is
really
a
unique
case.
there
are
children
in
north
carolina
who
have
been
adopted,
whose
families
are
settled.
they
ought
not
run
the
risk
if
this
decision,
if
against
us,
is
retroactive.
likewise,
there
are
children
in
north
carolina
whose
parental
rights
have
been
terminated
and
they--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court:
if
i
may
follow
up
on
a
question
that
justice
brennan
posed
before
lunch,
the
question
about
whether
or
not
you
can
draw
lines
between
categories
of
cases.
justice
brennan
asked,
what
would
happen
if
perhaps
a
termination
of
parental
rights
action
were
brought
by
a
private
party
instead
of
by
a
county
department
of
social
services?
and
in
fact
that
case
exists.
it's
being
held
in
abeyance
in
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina
pending
the
result
in
this
decision.
but
there
is
a
husband
who
is
asserting
that
he
has
a
right
to
an
appointed
attorney
in
a
termination
of
parental
rights
action
which
was
prosecuted
by
his
wife,
without
any
other
government
involvement
in
that.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
ah,
yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
yes,
sir.
his
former
wife.
similarly,
there's
a
case
pending
in
north
carolina--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--no,
sir,
he
doesn't.
it
is
more
ironic
than
that,
justice
burger,
because
the
man
prevailed
in
the
termination
action.
this
is
a
1983
action
on
behalf
of
the
winner
saying
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
won
i
should
have
had
an
attorney
at
the
earlier
case.
it's
an
interesting
little
case.
we've
got
a
case
in
north
carolina
where
the
question
is
whether
there
should
be
appointed
counsel
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
a
child
support
action
which
was
prosecuted
by
the
county.
and
you
know
that
in
the
light
of
boddie
v.
connecticut,
there
have
been
two
state
supreme
court
cases
where
the
question
is,
whether
or
not
a
respondent
in
a
domestic
action
has
got
a
right
to
a
court
appointed
attorney.
now,
this
line,
between
cases
involving
personal
liberty
and
your
physical
freedom,
and
all
the
other
kind
of
civil
cases,
is
under
assault
all
over
the
country.
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
needs
to
consider
that
very
carefully
and
that
if
they
do
they're
going
to
remember
that
the
history
of
the
right
to
counsel
in
a
criminal
case
is
one
which
shows
that
distinctions
based
on
degree,
distinctions
based
on
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
are
not
distinctions
which
are
going
to
be
able
to
hold
over
time,
we've
moved
from
powell
to
argersinger
and
scott.
what
happens
is--
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
--justice
stevens,
i
think
not.
i
think
the
bar
association,
and
throughout
its
entire
history,
has
emphasized
the
importance
of
counsel
and
it
is
strongly
committed
to
provide
lawyers
for
everybody.
look
at
their
position
on
law
school
enrollments,
and
compare
it,
perhaps,
to
the
position
of
the
american
medical
association
in
a
similar
situation.
mr.
steven
mansfield
shaber
i
suggested
to
justice
rehnquist
that
the
counsel
would
have
to
be
provided
in
those
instances...
perhaps
not
in
your
hypothetical...
simply
because
this
right
to
family
integrity
has
been
given
special
treatment
by
this
court
in
stanley
and
the
following
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
