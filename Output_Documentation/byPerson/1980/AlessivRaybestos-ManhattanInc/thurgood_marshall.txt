if
a
man
retires
by
age,
he
gets
workmen's
compensation?
justice
marshall
well,
how
much
does
he
get?
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean,
if
he
retires
at
65,
he
gets
a
certain
amount
of
money?
justice
marshall
regardless
of
his
condition?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
what
i
would
think
so,
but
you
say
that
automatically
if
he
retired
he
gets
workmen's
compensation?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
marshall
but
the
workmen's
compensation
is
based
on
the
disability,
not
his
age?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
what
i
thought.
