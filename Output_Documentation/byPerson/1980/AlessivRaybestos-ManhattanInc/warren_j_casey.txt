mr.
warren
j.
casey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
vesting
question
i'd
like
to
address
three
short
points.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
we're
dealing
with
private
contracts.
agreements
by
the
private
parties
deal
in
their
own
way
with
economic
security
during
retirement.
in
agreeing
to
set
up
a
retirement
plan
for
its
employees,
the
employer
faces
two
competing
interests.
the
employees
want
the
employer
to
agree
to
pay
them
and
to
assure
them
some
level
of
monthly
income
during
retirement.
the
employer
as
a
businessman
is
willing
to
incur
some
level
of
retirement
costs
for
his
employees
but
no
more.
the
private
retirement
contract
reflects
how
these
two
competing
interests,
retirement
costs
and
monthly
payments,
were
balanced
by
the
parties.
the
benefit
agreed
upon
under
the
raybestos
plan
is
an
integrated
benefit.
the
plan
takes
into
account
any
benefits
paid
by
raybestos
during
retirement
under
the
workers'
compensation
program.
this
was
the
benefit
decided
upon
by
the
parties
in
collective
bargaining
as
stated
in
the
plan
document,
both
before
and
after
erisa.
the
vesting
rules,
which
are
at
issue
here,
operate
on
that
integrated
benefit.
the
right
to
that
integrated
benefit,
whether
the
plan
integrates
with
social
security,
railroad
retirement,
or
as
here,
the
benefits
paid
by
raybestos
at
the
same
time
during
retirement
under
the
workers'
compensation
program,
the
right
to
that
integrated
benefit
vests
and
is
nonforfeitable.
the
plan
assure
a
defined
level
of
monthly
income
during
retirement.
there
is
never
any
moment
when
the
plan
participant
does
not
receive
that
monthly
income
during
retirement
assured
by
the
private
plan.
when,
for
example,
the
plan
member's
also
receiving
certain
periodic
income
under
the
workers'
compensation
program
during
retirement,
and
that
statutory
payment
ceases
for
whatever
reason
or
is
even
taken
away
retroactively,
the
private
plan
assures
a
defined
monthly
benefit.
there
is
never
a
moment
when
that
assured
monthly
benefit
is
conditional
or
not
fully
enforceable
against
the
private
plan.
mr.
warren
j.
casey
exactly,
your
honor.
the
employer
takes
into
account
any
other
periodic
income
under
the
workers'
compensation
program.
it
did
not,
for
example,
offset
with
social
security,
which
was
another
permissible
offset.
rather,
the
employer
took
into
account
that
a
plan
member
may
also
be
receiving
by
raybestos
certain
periodic
income
under
the
workers'
compensation
program
during
retirement,
and
it
assures
each
plan
member,
it
addresses
the
economic
security
for
each
plan
member.
in
setting
up
the
plan
it
assures
each
employee
who
vests
this
defined
level
of
monthly
income
assured
by
the
private
plan,
and
the
right
to
that
integrated
benefit;
whether
it's
zero
or
$100
a
month,
it's
an
integrated
benefit.
the
right
to
that
integrated
benefit,
to
that
monthly
income
assured
by
the
private
plan
is
nonforfeitable.
this
integration
was
approved
prior
to
erisa,
first
in
the
1968
revenue
ruling,
which
mr.
reich
alluded
to,
and
also
in
the
comprehensive
guides
for
pension
plan
qualification
which
were
published
and
republished
during
congress's
consideration
of
the
erisa
bills.
those
comprehensive
guides
brought
together
in
a
simple
approach
the
general
requirements
of
the
government
for
the
qualification
of
retirement
plans.
they
stated
what
integration
with
what
statutory
income
programs
during
retirement
may
be
permissible
under
the
tax
code.
erisa
is
a
highly
technical,
highly
specific
statute,
the
result
of
a
decade
of
study
of
the
private
retirement
system.
when
congress
intended
to
effect
subsequent
changes
in
the
existing
rules,
it
acted
with
precision.
nowhere
in
the
statute
or
in
the
thousands
of
pages
of
legislative
history
did
congress
ever
prohibit
this
integrated
benefit
or
did
it
ever
suggest
to
the
treasury
department
and
to
the
private
parties
who
draft
these
contracts
that
the
integrated
benefit
should
be
prohibited
under
the
vesting
rules.
it
simply
never
was,
prior
to
erisa,
nor
was
there
any
time
after
erisa,
was
there
any
inconsistency
between
a
private
plan
agreeing
to
provide
an
integrated
benefit
during
retirement,
fully
financed
by
the
plan's
sponsor,
and
the
entirely
separate
requirement
that
the
employee's
property
right
to
that
integrated
benefit
must
at
all
times
be
unconditional
and
fully
enforceable
against
the
private
plan.
there
is
never
any
reduction
in
the
monthly
income
assured
by
raybestos
under
the
private
plan,
and
all
paid
by
raybestos.
mr.
warren
j.
casey
your
honor,
mr.
gettis
basically
argues
that
erisa
does
not
preempt
and
includes
express
relief
from
preemption
for
any
state
law
related
to
retirement
plans
so
long
as
it
is
part
of
the
workers'
compensation
statute.
this
simply
misstates
the
statute.
the
statute
relieves
from
all
the
coverage
provisions
of
erisa,
including
the
vesting
funding,
any
plan
that's
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
the
workers'
compensation
law.
as
mr.
gettis
stated
and
it
has
always
been
agreed,
that
these
plans
simply
are
not
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
the
workers'
compensation
law.
this
1977
new
jersey
statute
directly
prohibits
a
private
plan
from
providing
a
benefit
during
retirement
integrated
with
other
benefits
the
private
employer
pays
at
the
same
time,
concurrently,
periodically,
with
that
retirement
income.
it
directly
regulates
these
private
retirement
plans
and
directly
regulates
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
retirement
plans.
it
affects
nothing
else
other
than
retirement
plans.
for
that
reason
it's
preempted
under
4(b)
assertion.
mr.
warren
j.
casey
justice
brennan,
under
most
state
workers'
compensation
laws,
an
employer
may
either
pay
into
a
state
fund
an
insurance
premium
which
will
then
fund
the
periodic
income
for
the
disability
or
it
may
make
arrangements
with
a
private
insurer.
the
third
possibility
is
for
an
employer
to
be
a
self
insurer.
in
order
to
be
a
self
insurer
he
just
can't
say,
i'm
going
to
agree
to
pay
these
benefits.
he
has
to,
i
believe
in
just
about
every
state,
have
an
approved
plan,
a
plan
approved
by
the
state,
which
specifies
what,
for
example,
the
claims
processing
procedures
often
are
part
of
these
things.
but
assuming--
mr.
warren
j.
casey
--as
i
recall,
the
legislative
history
in
that
provision
is
very
scant.
however,
as
i
recall,
the
legislative
history
does
note
that
there
was
no
reason
to
worry
about
the
vesting
and
funding
of
these
plans,
because
they're
totally
divorced
from
a
private
employer
plan
which
is
voluntary,
are
going
to
provide
a
period
income
benefit
during
retirement.
this
raybestos
plan
was
a
collectively
bargained
plan.
this
was
a
benefit,
it
was
a
voluntary
plan
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
agreed
to
in
1967.
and
this
is
the
benefit
it
provides.
thank
you.
