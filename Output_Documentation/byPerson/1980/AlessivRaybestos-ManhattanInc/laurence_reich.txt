mr.
laurence
reich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court:
is
the
right
of
a
defined
pension
plan
such
as
the
general
motors
and
raybestos-manhattan
plans
to
continue
since
erisa
as
before,
to
integrate
workers'
compensation
benefits
with
pension
plan
benefits?
integration
describes
a
benefit
structure
by
which
a
pension
plan
takes
into
account
employer
financed
benefits
under
a
governmental
benefit
plan.
in
determining
employer
financed
pension
plan
benefits,
whether
by
way
of
reduction
or
offset,
the
right
of
integration
of
benefits
proceeds
from
the
basic
structure
of
pension
plans
in
the
united
states,
the
fundamental
proposition
that
whether
an
employer
furnishes
post
retirement
income
to
its
employees
and
how
much
that
employer
furnishes
to
its
employees
is
a
matter
of
determination
in
the
first
instance
by
the
employer
and
in
the
case
of
a
collectively
bargained
plan,
such
as
the
two
plans
involved
in
these
cases,
a
matter
of
contract
between
the
employer
and
the
union
representing
the
employees.
integration
has
been
an
integral
part
of
pension
plan
benefit
structure
in
the
united
states
since
at
least
1942
when
it
was
expressly
approved
by
what
is
now
section
401(a)(5)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
social
security
is
indeed
the
most
universal
and
ubiquitous
of
these
benefits
that
is
integrated.
however,
it
is
by
no
means
the
only
benefit.
another
is
railroad
retirement
benefits,
and
third
is
workers'
compensation
benefits.
in
1968
workers'
compensation
benefits
were
held
subject
to
integration
by
the
internal
revenue
service
in
a
ruling,
revenue
ruling
68-243.
that
ruling
has
been
twice
republished
in
the
internal
revenue
service's
guide
to
qualification
of
pension,
profit-sharing,
and
stock
bonus
plans,
the
bible
of
the
internal
revenue
service
up
to
the
time
that
erisa
was
enacted.
the
last
republication
was
in
irs
publication
778.
we
know
that
publication
778
was
before
the
committees
that
wrote
erisa.
further,
workers'
compensation
integration
is
an
integral
part
of
the
pension
plan
structure
in
the
steel,
automotive,
and
telephone
industries.
it
surely
could
not
have
escaped
the
attention
of
congress.
section
203(a)
refers
indeed
to
forfeitures.
it
simply
states
that
each
pension
plan
shall
provide
that
an
employee's
right
to
his
normal
retirement
benefit
is
nonforfeitable
upon
the
attainment
of
normal
retirement
age.
now,
the
concept
of
nonforfeitability
did
not
spring
out
of
erisa.
indeed,
it
existed
at
the
time
erisa
was
enacted.
it
dates
back
at
least
to
section
401(a)(7)
which
was
introduced
into
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1962.
section
401(a)(7)
at
that
time
provided
merely
for
nonforfeitability
upon
plan
termination
or
discontinuance
of
contributions,
saying
essentially
the
same
thing.
erisa,
indeed,
expanded
the
application
of
the
concept
of
nonforfeitability
contained
in
section
401(a)(7).
now,
as
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
i
think,
observed,
the
3rd
circuit's
argument
in
its
opinion
was
that
section
203(a)
if
it
is
deemed
to
include
workers'
compensation
integration
as
a
forfeiture
must
include
every
integrated
offset
as
a
forfeiture.
to
do
that
requires
ignoring
the
plain
evidence
in
erisa
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
disturb
social
security
integration,
which
is
merely
one
of
the
integrating
offsets
available.
that
evidence
exists
in
section
401(a)(15)
of
the
code
and
section
206(b)
of
erisa.
contrary
to
the
petitioners'
and
appellants'
argument,
those
sections
do
not
authorize
social
security
or
railroad
retirement
benefit
integration.
they
merely
describe
a
limitation
upon
that
integration,
a
limitation,
moreover,
which
was
neither
new
to
erisa...
on
the
contrary,
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
the
two
sections
merely
codified
with
a
slight
extension
the
preexisting
irs
administrative
practice
on
limiting
social
security
integration.
now,
section
203(a)
requires
that
the
employee's
right
to
his
normal
retirement
benefit
be
nonforfeitable.
it
does
not
say
what
that
normal
retirement
benefit
is
to
be.
neither
does
the
section
3(19)
definition
of
nonforfeitable.
it
merely
refers
to
the
benefit
under
the
plan,
as
does
the
section
3(22)
definition
of
normal
retirement
benefit.
therefore
what
is
nonforfeitable
is
the
benefit
which
the
plan
provides;
in
this
case
that
benefit
has
never
been
anything
other
than
a
benefit
integrated
with
workers'
compensation
benefits.
and,
indeed,
since
mr.
sachs
has
referred
to
the
time
span
within
which
this
particular
provision
has
been
in
the
general
motors
pension
plan,
i
should
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
it
was
in
the
general
motors
hourly
rate
pension
plan,
the
plan
before
the
court,
from
1950
to
1961.
it
was
absent
from
1961
to
1970.
it
has
been
in
the
plan
from
1970
to
and
including
the
present
date.
it
is
not
something
which
was
sprung
upon
these
employees,
aside
from
the
fact
that,
of
course,
it
was
negotiated
by
their
union
shortly
before
they
retired.
it
was
a
fixture
of
the
plan.
it's
absent--
mr.
laurence
reich
--no,
sir.
if
the
treasury
regulation
didn't
exist,
i
submit
that
this
court
would
have
to
invent
it,
as
it
were.
the
treasury
regulation
merely
stands
as
very
strong,
persuasive
proof
that
what
the
statutory
analysis
shows
is
indeed
the
way
the
treasury
department
views
it,
and
the
treasury
department
has,
of
course,
been
expressly
authorized,
whether
the
regulation
be
considered
legislative
or
interpretative,
the
treasury
department
has
been
given
the
right,
power,
of
rulemaking
by
section
3002(c)
of
erisa.
mr.
laurence
reich
yes.
my
argument
does
not
depend
at
all
upon
it.
my
argument--
mr.
laurence
reich
--no,
sir,
it
would
not,
because--
mr.
laurence
reich
--no,
sir,
because
it's
a
fixture
of
the
plan,
a
fixture
of
the
plan
permitted
by
section
401(a)(5).
the
concept
of
integration,
as
i
started
with,
is
limited
to
a
situation
in
which
the
benefit
being
offset
is
a
benefit
under
a
governmental
plan,
and
i
refer
to
the
statute.
401(a)(5)
provides
for...
integration--
mr.
laurence
reich
--this
appears
in
the
petitioners'
and
appellants'
briefs
in
the
appendix,
i
know.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
is
section
401(a)(5)
of
the
code,
26
u.s.c.--
mr.
laurence
reich
--yes.
it
provides
that
a
plan
shall
not
be
considered
discriminatory
in
the
meaning
of
401(a)(4)
merely
because
contributions
or
benefits
differ
because
of
any
retirement
benefits
created
under
state
or
federal
law,
and
the
entire
principle
of
integration
permitted
by
the
internal
revenue
service
under
401(a)(5)
since
its
inception
in
1942
has
been
that
the,
only
the
statutory
benefits,
may
be
offset.
mr.
laurence
reich
i
submit
that
when
it
is
income
provided
as
post
retirement
income
to
a
retiree,
it
replaces--
mr.
laurence
reich
--yes.
mr.
laurence
reich
but
social
security
disability
benefits
are
also
benefits
for
disability,
although
it
need
not
be
work
connected.
the
work
connected
aspect
is
not
material,
i
should
say.
mr.
laurence
reich
it
is
compensation
for
a
disability,
it
is
compensation
for
a
disability
whether
it
is
injury,
accident,
or
occupational
disease.
it
is
compensation
for
a
disability
which
is--
mr.
laurence
reich
--well,
indeed,
when
the
period
for
which
it
is,
or
the
disability
covers
a
period
of
retirement,
i
suggest
that
it
should
so
be
considered
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
retirement
is,
the
concept
of
retirement
is
not
limited
to
retirement
for
age.
mr.
laurence
reich
no,
it's
been...
there
has
been
a
distinction
drawn
by
the
internal
revenue
service
in
holding
that
state
law
common
law
actions
may
not,
the
common
law
damages
may
not
be
offset.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
is
a
treasury--
mr.
laurence
reich
--oh,
yes,
sir.
i'm
saying,
i'm
distinguishing
between...
i'm
saying
that
the
regulation
411(a)(4)(a)
if
it
didn't
exist
would
nevertheless
have
to
exist,
the
rule
would
be
the
same.
it
has
been
declared
by
the
treasury
that
the
treasury
declaration
is
correct.
it
is
i
believe
manifest
from
the
legislative
history.
section
401(a)(5)
was
reenacted
by
erisa
without
material
change.
it
was
reenacted
by
erisa
with
the
administrative
interpretation
that
it
is
applicable
to
workers'
compensation
integration
as
well
as
the
social
security
integration
as
well
as
to
railroad
retirement
integration.
if
the
court
is
to
say
that
section
203
was
intended
to
preclude
integration
of
any
kind
of
benefits,
then
the
court
must
in
fact
suggest
that
congress
intended
in
section
203(a)
which
did
not
speak
of
integration,
to
overrule
and
implicitly
repeal
section
401(a)(5)
under
which
integration
exists
and
has
existed
for
40
years
under
which
workers'
compensation
benefit
integration
specifically
had
existed
for
at
least
six
years
prior
to
the
enactment.
mr.
laurence
reich
401(a)(5)--
mr.
laurence
reich
--1021,
i
believe
it
is,
in
title
ii.
mr.
laurence
reich
1016.
it's
in
section
1016,
which
merely--
mr.
laurence
reich
--that
was
part
of
erisa.
mr.
laurence
reich
oh,
the
1016
is
merely
a--
mr.
laurence
reich
--no,
it
is
not,
sir,
the
text
of
401(a)(5)
as
it
was
amended.
what
title
ii
did,
section
1016
is
a
part
of
title
ii
of
erisa.
what
title
ii
of
erisa
did--
mr.
laurence
reich
--the
code
citation
is
section
401(a)(5).
mr.
laurence
reich
it
is
not
in
the
code,
as
far
as
i
understand.
mr.
laurence
reich
it
is
merely
a
part
of
the
public
law.
what
it
did
was
simply
say,
section
401(a)(5)
is
hereby
amended
to
provide
as
follows.
the
codification
of
the
amendment
appears
within
the
code.
it
is
in
the
code
but
merely
the
enacting
section
is
not
in
the
code.
it
was
under--
mr.
laurence
reich
--not
in
title
29.
it
is
in
title
26,
because
it
was
an
amendment--
mr.
laurence
reich
--yes,
sir,
i'll
be
happy
to
do
so.
mr.
laurence
reich
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
before
recess,
the
text
of
section
401(a)(5)
of
the
code
as
it
was
amended
by
erisa
is
to
be
found
in
26
u.s.c.,
section
401(a)(5).
the
amendment
to
it
was
accomplished
by
section
1012(b)
of
public
law
93-406.
i
call
the
court's
attention
in
this
regard
to
page
18,
footnote
18,
of
the
brief
of
appellees
in
the
alessi
case
which
describes
the
manner
in
which
title
i
was
incorporated
into...
and
also
footnote
6
of
the
same
brief,
which
describe
the
manner
in
which
title
i
was
incorporated
into
title
29,
and
title
i
of
erisa
incorporated
into
title
29
of
the
u.s.
code;
title
ii,
amendments,
were
incorporated
into
title
26
of
the
u.s.
code.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
shortly
before
recess,
we
suggest
that
retirement
has
always
covered
termination
of
employment
for
age,
service,
disability,
or
any
of
those
three,
just
as
the
social
security
act
benefits
covered
benefits
for
age
and
disability,
just
as
the
railroad
retirement
act
covers
benefits
for
age
and
disability.
mr.
laurence
reich
yes,
but
when...
you
can,
but
you
can
also
get
workmen's
compensation
when
you
are
retired.
when
you
are
retired
the
workmen's
compensation
is
providing
an
income
relating
to
disability,
and
the
normal
retirement
benefit
as
defined
in
section
3(22)
of
erisa
does
include
a
retirement
benefit
for
disability
within
the
normal
retirement
benefit,
so
the
normal
retirement
benefit
subsumes
within
it--
mr.
laurence
reich
--it
is
not
necessarily
to
presume
that
he
would
have.
the
concept
of
section
401(a)(5)
is
that
the
employer
has
funded
two
sets
of
benefits
to
provide
income,
he's
funded
the
plan
benefit;
he
has
funded
the
disability
benefit
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law.
they
both
are
providing
income
during
his
retirement,
whether
the
retirement
is
occasioned
by
the
disability
or
whether
the
retirement
was
occasioned
by
age
and--
mr.
laurence
reich
--he
can
under
the
laws
of
many
states
and
new
jersey
is
one
of
those.
mr.
laurence
reich
if
he's
retired
and
wasn't
working
he
can,
and
in
fact
as
was
pointed
out,
the
general
motors
plan
provision
covers
only
cases
in
which
he
has
applied
after,
more
than
two
years
after
he
retired.
he
can
under
state
law,
get
benefits
under
workmen's
compensation
law
for
disability,
even
after
he
has
retired.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
would
depend
upon
the
award
and
the
particular
state.
mr.
laurence
reich
yes.
yes,
justice
marshall,
he
does.
mr.
laurence
reich
well,
regardless
of
his
physical?
it
would
relate
to
his
physical
condition,
i
would
suggest.
mr.
laurence
reich
no,
sir,
no
i
did
not.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
laurence
reich
i
said
he
may
get
disability
retirement
benefits...
disability
benefits
or
workers'
compensation
after
he
retires.
mr.
laurence
reich
that
is
correct.
mr.
laurence
reich
no,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
otherwise,
justice
marshall.
if
i
did,
i--
mr.
laurence
reich
--that's
right,
an
injury
or
other
disability.
mr.
laurence
reich
no,
there
would
not.
mr.
laurence
reich
it's
only
where
the
same
employer
funds
both
the
workmen's
compensation
benefits
and
the
pension
benefits,
if
he
got
the
benefits
from
another
employer,
then--
mr.
laurence
reich
--the
plan
would
take
no
offset.
