justice
stewart
that
rather
circular
statutory
argument
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
the
treasury
regulation,
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
but
your
argument
didn't
depend
at
all
upon
that
regulation?
justice
stewart
and
in
other
words,
your
argument
would
allow
a
plan
to
offset
by
the
amount
of
recovery
in
a
common
law
court,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
it
hasn't
always
been
a
fixture
of
the
plan,
and--
justice
stewart
--where
does
this
appear?
justice
stewart
401(a)(5).
it's
on
page
1a
of
the
appellants'
brief
in
the?
justice
stewart
of
course...
well,
workmen's
compensation
is
not
the
same
as
retirement
benefits.
justice
stewart
workmen's
compensation
is
compensation
for
illness
or
accident,
employment
connected,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
it's
not
a
retirement
plan.
justice
stewart
well,
in
any
event,
compensation,
workmens'
compensation,
is
compensation
for
injury
or
accident.
it
is
not
a
pension
benefit.
justice
stewart
and
it's
not
generally...
i
doubt
that
it
would
be
generally
considered
as
a
retirement
benefit,
if
you're
relying
on
that
language
of
the
statute.
justice
stewart
well,
i
suppose
a
judgment
in
a
state
court
would
be
the
same
argument,
a
retirement
benefit
created
under
state
law.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
a
treasury
regulation.
justice
stewart
it
has
no...
it
plays
no
part
in
your
present
statutory?
justice
stewart
but
you
can
get
workmen's
compensation
without
retiring.
