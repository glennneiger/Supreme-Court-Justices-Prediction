mr.
marc
c.
gettis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
is
now
in
possession
of
a
handful
of
briefs
from
respondent,
appellant,
and
various
amici,
all
of
which
briefs
cite
the
same
legislative
history
and
quote
the
same
statements
from
senators
williams
and
javits
and
representative
dent
regarding
the
broad
nature
of
preemption
under
section
514
of
erisa.
petitioners
herein
have
never
contended
otherwise.
we've
agreed
all
along
that
section
514
does
provide
for
broad
preemption.
however,
we
find
it
remarkable
that
all
but
one
of
these
briefs
virtually
ignore
the
existence
of
section
4(b)(3)
of
erisa.
that
section
provides
an
express
exception
to
preemption.
among
other
things,
it
exempts
pension
plans
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
state
workers'
compensation
laws.
it
exempts
these
plans
from
title
i,
and
section
514
is
a
provision
of
title
i
of
erisa.
therefore,
in
section
4(b)(3)
congress
has
recognized
explicitly
that
certain
areas
of
traditional
state
interest
are
exempt
from
preemption
under
erisa.
erisa
has
an
internal
provision
right
within
the
statute
allowing
state
regulation
of
workers'
compensation,
even
if
that
regulation
may
relate
to
pension
plans.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
are
you
referring
to
the
treasury
regulation?
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
we
do
contend
that
this
is
unauthorized
and
contrary
to
the
statute.
what
i
was
just--
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
--yes,
but
i
do
concur
that
that
regulation
is
invalid
and
unauthorized.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
statute
itself
permits
state
regulation
of
workers'
compensation,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
employment
relationship,
including
workers'
compensation,
which
protects
against
injury
suffered
in
the
course
of
employment,
is
a
traditional
area
of
state
interest.
a
number
of
cases
have
been
cited
standing
for
the
proposition
of
broad
preemption.
but
other
than
the
decision
of
the
3rd
circuit
below,
no
case
has
held
a
state
workers'
compensation
statute
preempted.
in
fact,
one
district
court
and
one
court
of
appeals,
the
9th
circuit,
has
recognized
workers'
compensation
laws
of
states
as
an
exception
to
the
preemption
doctrine
of
erisa.
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
under
4(b)(3)
should
not
be,
as
our
adversaries
suggest,
whether
a
plan
is
exempt
under
4(b)(3).
rather
it
must
be
to
the
statute.
if
a
plan
maintained
to
comply
with
a
state
workers'
compensation
law
is
exempt
from
erisa
preemption,
a
fortiori
the
underlying
workers'
compensation
statute
must
be
preempted.
the
fact
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
had
a
workers'
compensation
statute
in
effect
since
1911
and
has
continuously
regulated
the
area
for
over
70
years
shows
that
this
is
a
strong
area
of
state
interest
and
has
been
traditionally
regulated
by
the
state.
in
enacting
chapter
156
as
an
amendment
to
the
new
jersey
workers'
compensation
act,
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
expressed
its
policy
to
protect
workers'
compensation
benefits
to
insure
that
a
compensation
award
adjudged
by
a
tribunal
must
be
paid.
there
is
another
area
of
traditional
state
interest
which
has
been
ruled
an
exception
to
erisa
preemption.
that
is
the
area
of
domestic
relations
and
support.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
4(b)(3)
of
erisa
perhaps
was
cited
as
29
u.s.c.
1003(b).
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
your
honor,
that's
quoted
at
page
19
of
the
reply
brief,
and
i
believe
it
also
appears
in
the
main
brief
at
page
44...
of
the
petitioners'
brief,
that
is.
in
the
area
of
domestic
relations
and
support,
preemption
challenges
have
been
litigated
under
erisa
where
a
state
court
has
ordered
a
pensioner's
pension
benefits
to
be
garnished
or
severed
to
satisfy
that
worker's
obligations
under
state
laws,
either
support
obligations
or
community
property
laws.
two
courts
of
appeals,
both
the
2nd
circuit
and
the
9th
circuit,
have
held
that
such
state
laws
are
not
preempted
under
erisa,
that
these
laws
only
marginally
affect
pension
plans
and
are
within
an
area
of
strong
state
interest.
one
court
of
appeals
which
has
not
permitted
a
state
court
to
garnish
a
pension
has
done
so
under
section
206
of
erisa,
and
did
not
engage
in
any
preemption
analysis
of
the
state
law.
we
agree
with
our
adversaries'
contention
that
erisa
preemption
is
intended
to
assist
in
the
congressional
goal
of
providing
for
uniform
regulation
of
pension
plans,
but
our
adversaries
incorrectly
assert
that
the
new
jersey
law
in
question
frustrates
this
purpose.
in
fact,
it
is
the
use
of
the
pension
offset
by
general
motors
and
raybestos-manhattan
which
frustrates
this
purpose.
due
to
the
offset
of
workers'
compensation
benefits,
the
pension
benefits
may
vary
from
state
to
state,
depending
on
the
particular
workers'
compensation
statutory
scheme
in
the
state.
a
finding
that
chapter
156
of
the
new
jersey
laws
of
1977
is
valid,
if
anything
would
assist
in
achieving
the
congressional
goal
of
uniformity
of
pension
plan
regulation.
our
adversaries
have
tailored
their
arguments
depending
upon
which
issue
in
this
case
they're
addressing.
when
arguing
that
chapter
156
of
the
new
jersey
statutes
is
preempted,
our
adversaries
claim
that
new
jersey
is
attempting
to
regulate
pension
plans
and
such
regulation
is
not
permitted
by
erisa.
when
arguing
against
nonforfeitability
under
erisa,
our
adversaries
suggest
that
erisa
does
not
protect
state
workers'
compensation
awards.
it
is
clear
that
the
new
jersey
statute
in
question
protects
workers'
compensation
awards
whereas
erisa
protects
pension
benefits.
these
are
separate
benefits.
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
section
203
does
not
prohibit
the
offset
in
question,
which
of
course
petitioners
strongly
suggest
it
does,
chapter
156
of
the
new
jersey
laws
would
still
stand
as
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state
police
power.
even
if
this
court
were
to
hold
section
203
not
prohibiting
the
offset,
it
still
cannot
in
any
way
be
said
that
the
permitting
of
such
offset
was
a
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
erisa.
congress
clearly
set
forth
its
purposes
in
section
2
of
erisa
to
prohibit
certain
abuses
which
had
taken
place.
they
set
forth
vesting
standards,
minimum
funding
standards,
disclosure
requirements,
and
fiduciary
requirements.
in
no
way
did
congress
show
any
intent
to
permit
offsets
of
workers'
compensation.
therefore,
the
state
law
in
its
attempt
to
protect
workers'
compensation
benefits
does
not
in
any
way
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
attainment
of
congressional
objectives
and
goals
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
enacting
erisa.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
your
preemption
is--
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
have
never
contended
otherwise.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
however,
the
preemption
provision,
section
514,
is
a
part
of
title
i.
what
petitioners
are
contending--
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
--that
is
not
this
plan.
what
we
suggest
is
that
the
inquiry
is
not
whether
the
plan
is
a
4(b)(3)
plan,
but
rather
to
the
underlying
workers'
compensation
law.
in
other
words,
if
a
plan
is
maintained
to
comply
for
workers'
compensation
purposes
and
that
plan
is
exempt
under
erisa,
it
must
follow
that
the
underlying
workers'
compensation
law
enacted
by
the
state
with
which
that
plan,
for
which
it
was
created,
must
not
be
preempted.
if
a
plan
is
exempt,
it's
not
possible
that
the
underlying
state
statute
is
not
exempt.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
well,
we
suggest
that
in
4(b)(3)
congress
has
shown
an
intent
to
allow
states
to
regulate
certain
areas,
traditionally
within
state
regulation,
not
to
regulate
pensions
but
to
regulate
these
particular
areas,
and
should
that
regulation
"relate
to
pension
plans",
that
will
not
invalidate
the
state
statute.
mr.
marc
c.
gettis
thank
you.
