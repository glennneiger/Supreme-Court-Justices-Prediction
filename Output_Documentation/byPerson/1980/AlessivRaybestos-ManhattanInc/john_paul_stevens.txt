justice
stevens
mr.
sachs,
let
me
just...
this
suddenness
of
it,
it's
been
a
part
of
the
plan
for
quite
some
time?
justice
stevens
were
these
plans
the
product
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
stevens
well,
usually
they
are,
where
you've
got
a
union
involved,
and
the
terms
of
the
plan
are
usually
a
key
thing
in
negotiation.
justice
stevens
isn't
it
fair
to
assume
the
union
knew
about
this
offset
provision?
it's
not
something
like
fine
print
at
the
bottom
of
the
contract
or
anything
like
this.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
it
seems
to
me
you're
making
sort
of
an
equitable
argument
when
we
really
have
a
rather
dry
statutory
question.
justice
stevens
you'd
make
the
same
argument,
even
if
this
had
been
in
the
plan
for
40
years
and
everybody
knew
about
it,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
stevens
mr.
sachs,
would
you
address
this
very
narrow
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
made?
you
say
that
this
is
forfeiture
and
it's
not
permitted
forfeiture
under
subparagraph
(3).
well,
they
say,
well,
if
that
argument
follows,
then
also
an
offset
for
social
security
benefits
would
be
a
forfeiture--
justice
stevens
--and
it
is
clear
that
that's
permitted.
how
would
you
get
out
of
that?
justice
stevens
are
they
a
forfeiture
or
not?
justice
stevens
if
they're
not
a
forfeiture,
how
can
you
be
so
sure
this
is
a
forfeiture?
that's
the--
justice
stevens
--so
your
argument
is
that
it's
not
a
forfeiture
because
there's
evidence
congress
specifically
intended
to
permit
this
kind
of
offset.
they
argue
there's
comparable
evidence
with
respect
to
workmen's
compensation
because
of
the
history
of
the
treasury
regulation.
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
justice
stevens
mr.
gettis,
can
i
interrupt
you
again,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i've
caught
it?
i'm
not...
you
said
4(b)(3)
is
the
section
you
read
before?
justice
stevens
is
that
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
stevens
do
you
happen
to
know
the
page?
do
you
have
it
under
a
different
number,
mr.
gettis?
justice
stevens
1003(b).
justice
stevens
mr.
gettis,
let
me
just...
because
i
frankly
had
missed
the
point.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
i'm
reading
from
your
blue
brief
at
page
44,
and
i
don't
have
the
full
text
of
the
statute
before
me,
but
the
section
on
which
you
rely,
the
4(b)(3),
is
described
as
providing
a
plan
"maintained
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
applicable
workmen's
compensation
laws.
"
is
not
subject
to
title
i.
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
quite
like
an
exception
from
the
preemption
section,
is
it?
justice
stevens
and
furthermore,
this
is
not
a
plan
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
the
state
workmen's
compensation
law.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
well,
the
preemption
does
not
apply
to
plans
maintained
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
state...
which
is
not
this
plan.
justice
stevens
i
don't
follow
the
argument.
what
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
says
is
that
a
workmen's
comp.
plan
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
federal
statute.
justice
stevens
could
you
give
me
the
code
cite
to
401(a)(5)?
justice
stevens
mr.
reich,
i
confess
i
had
misunderstood
part
of
your
argument.
401(a)(5)
is
not
part
of
erisa?
justice
stevens
did
you
say
it
was
reenacted
in
erisa,
and
in
what
section
of
erisa
is
401(a)(5)?
justice
stevens
is
there
a
1016?
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
where
is
that?
justice
stevens
i
know,
but
where
in?
justice
stevens
is
it
printed
here
somewhere?
justice
stevens
could
you
give
me
the
code
citation
of
1016?
justice
stevens
no,
i
want
the
code
citation
of
the
statute,
the
part
of
erisa
that
reenacts
401(a)(5).
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
well,
after
lunch,
will
you
tell
me
where
i
can
find
401(a)(5)
in
erisa,
if
i
can?
in
title
29
of
the
united
states
code?
justice
stevens
well,
you
said
it
was
reenacted
as
part
of
erisa.
you
tell
me
after
lunch
where
to
look
for
it.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
though,
that's
related
to
one
i
know
that
justice
rehnquist
asked?
in
this
case
the
reason
the
man
gets
workmen's
compensation
as
well
as
the
retirement
benefits
is
because
his
right
to
workmen's
compensation
depends
on
an
injury
he
suffered
while
he
was
employed
by
the
employer
who
also
funded
the
retirement
plan?
justice
stevens
what
would
the
retirement
plan
and
what
would
the
law
be
if
after
his
retirement
he
went
to
work
for
an
entirely
different
employer
and
was
injured
and
then
became
entitled
to
workmen's
compensation
as
a
result
of
that
injury?
would
there
be
an
offset
there?
justice
stevens
because
it's
not
funded?
justice
stevens
there's
no
offset.
