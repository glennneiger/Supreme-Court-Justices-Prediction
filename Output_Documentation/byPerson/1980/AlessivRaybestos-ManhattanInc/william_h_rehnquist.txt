justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
if
i
may.
this
erisa
statute
does
give
authority
to
the
treasury
department
to
issue
regulations,
does
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
administering
an
act?
justice
rehnquist
counsel,
the
internal
revenue
service
i
had
always
supposed
to
be
part
of
the
treasury
department.
justice
rehnquist
so
that,
isn't
it
rather
unlikely
that
the
administrator
of
erisa
for
treasury
would
be
at
odds
with
the
administrator
of
the
irs?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
had
said
that
the
irs
took
a
different
view?
justice
rehnquist
your
contention,
then,
is
that
the
regulation
is
invalid?
justice
rehnquist
and
it's
invalid
across
the
board?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
contend
that
the
regulation
previously
discussed
is
unauthorized
by
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
you're
addressing
the
preemption
act?
justice
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
a
retired
person
getting
workmen's
compensation.
presumably
he
would
have
retired
and
then
taken
another
job?
justice
rehnquist
how?
if
it's
not
arising
in
the
course
of
employment,
if
he
had
retired
and
wasn't
working,
that
is?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
raybestos
collective
bargaining
contract
expressly
contemplated
workmen's
compensation
payments
as
a
part
of
the
pension
plan?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
is
what
you
would
call
a
typographical
error
or
omission?
justice
rehnquist
if
one
were
to
turn
to
the
original
source
one
would
find
the
thing
that
you
state
it
was?
