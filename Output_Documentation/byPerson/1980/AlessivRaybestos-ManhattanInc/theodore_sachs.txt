mr.
theodore
sachs
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
involves
consolidated
matters
arising
from
the
3rd
circuit
on
appeal
from
and
certiorari
to
the
3rd
circuit.
i'm
of
counsel
in
the
alessi
v.
raybestos
matter,
and
with
the
court's
permission
i'll
address
the
203(a)
issue
of
erisa
and
mr.
gettis
will
then
address
the
preemption
question.
the
3rd
circuit
decided
in
this
matter
that
notwithstanding
the
very
broad
nonforfeitability
guarantees
in
section
203(a)
of
the
pension
reform
act
with
respect
to
normal
retirement
benefits,
that
a
workmen's
compensation
offset
provision
in
a
retirement
plan
did
not
violate
that
statute.
the
decision
and
analysis
of
the
3rd
circuit
has
been
disagreed
with
by
at
least
one
other
circuit,
the
6th,
and
by
at
least
seven
district
courts.
and
i
will
respectfully
suggest
that
the
3rd
circuit
paid
excessive
attention
to
form
and
indeed
to
the
form
of
a
regulation
whose
nature
the
intended
beneficiary,
the
irs,
does
not
agree
with.
the
fact
of
the
matter
in
this
situation
is
that
normal
retirement
benefits
earned
over
the
life
careers,
working
careers
of
the
affected
individuals,
have
indeed
been
forfeited,
and
that
is
seen
very
directly
by
looking
at
the
facts.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
theodore
sachs
no,
that
is
correct.
there
is
certain
administrative
authority
with
respect
to
treasury;
there
is
certain
administrative
authority
with
respect
to
the
department
of
labor.
but
there
is
none
of
the
kind
of
administrative
or
rule
making
authority
which
the
3rd
circuit
conceived
to
be
applicable
and
which
the
internal
revenue
service
renounces.
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
claim
legislative
rule
making
authority
which
the
3rd
circuit
found.
treasury
purports
to
find
that
authority
in
an
interpretive
basis.
but
the
interpretive
basis,
we
submit,
is
contrary
to
the
statute
in
question
and
indeed
the
argument
made
by
the
government
brief
here
is
contrary
to
the
argument
which
it
made
below.
there
is
a
diametrical
change
in
position.
if
i
may,
the
specific
facts
will
highlight
how
the
statutory
provision
directly
works.
each
of
these
employees
had
put
in,
in
the
case
of
raybestos,
more
than
30
years
when
they
retired
in
'72
and
'73.
they
earned
normal
retirement
benefits.
i
emphasize
there
was
no
disability
pension
question
here;
they
earned
normal
retirement
benefits.
each
had
reached
age
65.
similarly,
in
the
case
of
the
general
motors
plan.
each
had
reached
normal
retirement
age
of
65
and
had
rendered
a
number
of
years
of
service
almost
as
much.
they
in
fact
began
to
receive
100
percent
of
the
normal
retirement
benefits
under
the
plan.
they
did
so
for
several
years,
and
then
a
funny
thing
happened.
they
made
an
application
for
partial
permanent
disability
under
the
new
jersey
workers
compensation
statute
and
they
were
awarded
that.
this
was
for
a
variety
of
permanent
occupational
diseases
and
injuries,
including
pulmonary
conditions,
asbestosis,
other
serious
disabling
conditions,
and
at
that
point
invoking
the
respective
plans,
general
motors
and
raybestos-manhattan
cut
off
the
pensions.
the
pensions
ceased
at
that
point
in
an
effort
at
recoupment
by
both
companies
of
an
amount
equivalent
to
the
workers'
compensation
awards.
they
did
so
in
the
case
of
gm
under
a
plan
which
is
plainly
conditioning
the
benefits
upon
forbearance
from
filing
that
workers
comp.
claim.
if
the
individuals
in
the
gm
plan
had
not
filed
for
workers'
compensation,
they
would
have
continued
to
receive
their
pension,
and
indeed
had
they
filed
their
application
for
workers'
compensation
within
two
years
after
they
had
retired,
under
the
plan
itself
gm
could
not
have
claimed
an
offset.
so
there
was
a
double
condition
here:
one,
in
the
first
place,
filing
for
workers'
comp.
cut
off
the
pension;
in
the
second
place,
if
that
claim
were
not
filed
within
two
years,
the
pension
was
cut
off.
in
the
raybestos
plan
the
specific
language
begins,
"notwithstanding
the
other
provisions
of
this
article
6,
the
following
condition
shall
apply
to
the
payment
of
retirement
income.
"
and
then
under
this
extraordinary
clause
in
the
raybestos
plan,
a
whole
array
of
benefits,
collateral
benefits,
which
the
employee
might
receive
are
then
used
to
invoke
a
forfeiture
to
cut
off
his
pension.
not
merely
workers'
compensation
or
occupational
disease,
but
unemployment
compensation,
a
factor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
which
the
internal
revenue
service
itself
doesn't
recognize;
cash
sickness
benefits,
which
internal
revenue
has
not
recognized.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
i'm
not
suggesting
a
disparity
of
views
as
between
treasury
and
irs.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
oh,
i
am
saying
that,
sir,
with
respect
to
the
specific
elements
that
are
part
of
the
offset
in
the
raybestos
plan.
the
treasury
rulings,
pre
erisa,
which
had
been
invoked
by
the
various
defendants
here
and
the
various
amici
supporting
their
position
don't
go
so
far
as
to
permit
what
raybestos
has
done
and
claimed
here,
as
part
of
this
plan.
irs,
we
sought
to
suggest
in
the
briefs
and
other
courts
have
recognized,
has
drawn
absolutely
irrational
lines
as
to
what
kind
of
offset
is
permitted
or
what
kind
of
offset
is
not
permitted,
and
all
i
was
meaning
to
suggest,
your
honor,
in
my
last
comment,
is
that
there
are
elements
within
the
raybestos
plan
which
don't
satisfy
even
the
irrational
standards
of
treasury,
as
those
had
been
enunciated
in
a
variety
of
treasury
rulings.
the
point
i
seek
to
make
here
is
that
the
reality
which
is
confronted
here
is
that
each
of
these
individuals
who
received
a
normal
retirement
benefit
on
account
of
age
and
service
suddenly
had
that
benefit
divested.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
workmens'--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--it
has
not,
your
honor,
with
all
respect.
the
gm
offset
came
in
in
1970,
two
years
before
the
petitioners
retired.
mr.
theodore
sachs
it's
difficult
to
answer
that
yes
or
no,
your
honor.
they
were
the--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--there
are
aspects,
your
honor,
there
are
aspects
of
the
present
plan
of
general
motors
which
are
of
the
power
of
collective
bargaining,
the
product
of
collective
bargaining.
there
are
aspects
of--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
the
union
was
aware
of
that,
but
your
honor's
question
was
related
to
the
length
and
duration
of
these
clauses,
and
my
response
is
that
they
came
into
the
contracts
in
1970
virtually
at
end
of
the
working
career
of
these
employees.
the
employees
had
worked
28,
29
years.
they
came
in
at
the
tail
end
of
that.
mr.
theodore
sachs
well,
the
equitable
argument
is
relevant,
your
honor,
because
of
the
congressional
purpose,
and
that
is
the
key,
i
would
respectfully
submit.
congress
said
this
is
not--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--absolutely
no
question,
your
honor.
i
would
certainly
be
making
that
argument.
but
i
make
the
point
because
there
is
a
claim
of
reliance,
there
is
a
claim
on
contractual
provisions,
as
though
that
could
somehow
overcome
the
statute.
but
there
is
no
reliance,
in
fact.
the
point,
additionally,
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
workmen's
compensation
benefits
which
was
awarded
under
new
jersey
law
had
no
relationship
to
wage
loss,
was
not
dependent
on
wage
loss,
and
in
fact
it
would
have
been
paid
and
could
have
been
paid
had
the
claim
been
made
while
these
men
were
still
working
and
had
not
retired.
so
that
we
ought
to
dismiss
from
the
picture
any
suggestion
here
that
they
are
somehow
receiving
workmen's
comp.,
something
beyond
what
they
otherwise
could
have
received.
these
are
different
benefits.
the
retirement
benefit
was
earned.
but,
directly
responsive
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens,
congress
said
in
enacting
this
statute
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
reform.
that's
why
this
is
called
a
pension
reform
act;
this
is
a
broad
remedial
statute.
and
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
and
the
debates
make
absolutely
clear
it
wanted
to
do,
was
inject
notions
of
equity,
so
that
workers'
legitimate
expectations
could
be
realized.
and
there
were
two
particular
areas
in
the
matter
of
vesting
that
we're
talking
about,
in
addition
to
the
other
remedies
this
statute
was
designed
to
achieve
which
are
pertinent
here.
when
we're
talking
about
vesting,
what
congress
wanted
to
assure
is,
one,
that
when
the
time
for
retirement
came,
there
would
be
money
in
the
coffers
to
pay
the
pension.
and
that's
what
this
court
dealt
with
in
nachman.
and
the
other
thing
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
sure
that
the
small
print
would
not
take
away
what
the
employee
anticipated
over
his
working
career
he
was
in
fact
going
to
receive.
and
that
is
why,
based
upon
the
findings
of
congress,
that
workers
with
long
years
of
service
and
significant
periods
of
service
were
losing
the
retirement
benefits
on
which
they
had
planned
for
a
working
career
lifetime.
congress
enunciated
an
extraordinarily
broad
rule
in
section
203(a).
it's
stated
that
all
is
forbidden
except
which
we
permit
with
respect
to
normal
retirement
benefits.
203(a)
says
that
a
worker
is
entitled,
and
coupling
this
with
definitions
in
(3),
part
19,
of
the
act,
"a
worker
is
entitled
to
an
unconditional
right
to
fulfillment
of
his
normal
retirement
benefit
when
he
reaches
normal
retirement
age
and
when
he
attains
any
of
the
alternative
minimum
mandatory
vesting
schedules
of
the
act.
"
now,
when
congress
intended
exceptions
it
said
what
it
wanted
to
do.
and
in
203(a)(3)
it
stated
the
exceptions
which
it
was
willing
to
recognize,
and
this
is
not
one
of
them.
congress
did
not
permit
any
exception
for
workers'
compensation,
never;
never
in
this
act,
never
before
this
act,
never
in
any
pre
erisa
history
has
congress
ever
acknowledged
the
euphemism
which
is
used
by
the
defendants
that
this
has
something
to
do
with
integration,
the
euphemism
with
which
the
3rd
circuit
was,
unfortunately,
taken.
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
your
honor.
the
regulation
is
invalid
for
numerous
reasons.
mr.
theodore
sachs
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
certainly
it
is
invalid
in
application
here.
the
regulation
to
which
the
3rd
circuit
gave
dispositive
deference
for
all
practical
purposes
says
that
you
can
set
off
benefits...
unqualified
word:
benefits...
created
under
state
or
federal
law
and
social
security
benefits,
as
an
offset
against
normal
retirement
benefits.
there
isn't
a
shred
of
a
support
for
that
in
the
statute,
it
flies
in
the
face
of
the
broad
and
unqualified
provision
of
203(a),
unqualified
except
of
course
for
the
specific
exceptions
to
203(a),
which
are
enumerated,
and
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
this.
the
6th
circuit--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--yes.
mr.
theodore
sachs
your
honor,
there
is
absolutely
no
question
that
social
security
offsets
are
permitted.
mr.
theodore
sachs
they
are
not
a
forfeiture
because--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--they
are
not
a
forfeiture
because
congress
independently
addressed
in
erisa
social
security
integration.
we
have
had
social
security
integration
since
1942.
ironically,
social
security
came
first;
pensions,
as
we
know
them
now,
were
treated
by
congress
in
1942
as
a
supplement
to
social
security
and
the
integration,
were
that--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--your
honor,
if
i
may,
not
merely
evidence;
the
statute
does
speak
explicitly
to
social
security
in
206(b)
of
erisa
and
in
401(a)(15)
of
the
tax
code,
which
was
added
by
erisa,
congress
agonized
about
integration
of
social
security
benefits.
congress
didn't
see
this
as
a
solution,
it
saw
it
as
a
problem,
that
of
social
security
benefits.
and
the
compromise
which
congress
reached
in
enacting
erisa
was
to
say
for
the
moment,
we'll
freeze
social
security
levels
of
integration
so
that
if
they
go
up,
you
can't
cut
down
the
amount
of
pension
which
is
otherwise
going
to
be
payable.
but
the
point,
your
honor,
is
they
addressed
social
security
as
such,
explicitly
legislated
on
social
security
as
such.
the
3rd
circuit
somehow
had
the
notion
that
we
were
claiming
that
if
you
can't
fix
social
security
under
one
of
the
sections
to
203(a),
it
can't
stand.
social
security
integration
doesn't
relate
to
203(a)
and
isn't
dependent
on
it.
it
is
independently
dealt
with.
social
security
came
into
the
picture
again
in
1942,
and
has
been
carried
forward
in
the
tax
code
for
totally
unrelated
reasons.
treasury
was
never
in
the
business
of
evaluating
the
fairness
of
workers'
benefits
or
assuring
that
they
would
not
be
lost
except
only
in
the
context,
very
peripherally,
of
making
sure
under
401(a),
which
is
the
section
on
tax
preference
for
pension
plans,
of
making
sure
that
there
would
not
be
discrimination
in
favor
of
higher
compensated
persons
and
officers.
as
part
of
that
analysis,
congress
in
permitting
the
supplementing
of
social
security
benefits
said,
okay,
we
recognize
that
if
we
permit
the
so
called
integration,
lower
compensated
employees
might
lose
out;
we'll
make
an
exception
in
that.
they
did
it
in
'42
and
they
continued
it
ever
after.
in
1974
and
in
preceding
years,
when
congress
considered
adoption
of
this
statute,
they
were
very
much
concerned
about
that,
and
they
thought
there
was
a
social
problem.
but
they
also
recognized
that
there
were
cost
factors
as
to
social
security,
and
the
compromise
is
what
i
have
indicated.
but
that
whole
discrete
history
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
entire
new
set
of
regulations
which
congress
imposed
under
203(a).
it
recognized
it
was
dealing
with
new
standards.
indeed,
in
the
3rd
circuit
analysis,
it
carried
the
social
security
comparison
so
far
as
to
say,
well,
you
can
have
social
security
disability
offsets
against
normal
retirement
benefits.
and
again,
it
unfortunately
was
persuaded
of
something
that
can't
be
a
fact,
because
social
security
disability
benefits
end
at
age
65
and
retirement
benefits
begin,
your
normal
retirement,
at
65.
and
the
3rd
circuit
was
dealing
with
an
illusory
problem.
the
situation...
seeing
that
my
time
is
up,
your
honors,
and
i
want
to
reserve
time,
i
might
just--
mr.
theodore
sachs
--yes.
i
want
to
reserve
some
rebuttal
time.
the
point
i
simply
want
to
conclude
with
is
that
congress
intended
here
to
comprehensively
protect
normal
retirement
benefits
on
the
theory
that
these
are
the
workers'
own
wages,
but
deferred.
and
consequently,
when
he
loses
those
deferred
wages
at
time
of
retirement
through
any
device
whether
it
is
sophisticated
or
simple
minded,
as
this
court
has
said
in
other
contexts,
that
is
prohibited.
the
3rd
circuit
turned
the
rule
around,
since
the
statute
says
all
which
is
not
permitted
is
prohibited,
that
should
be
the
in
jure
and
the
forfeiture
should
be
reversed.
i'll
reserve
my
time,
with
the
court's
permission.
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
sachs
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
submit
that
it's
an
extraordinary
mode
of
interpreting
a
pension
reform
law
to
look
at
prior
practices
which
we
submit
congress
intended
to
end,
because
they
were
abuses.
now,
it's
been
suggested
to
you
that
nothing
has
changed.
i
suggest
to
you
that
by
this
act
everything
has
changed.
in
the
first
place,
those
practices
which
are
sought
to
be
escalated
here
into
justification
for
continuation
of
the
practices
were
never
permissible
before.
26
u.s.c.
401(a)(5)
which
appears
at
1a
of
appellants'
appendix
indicates
that
this
word
integration,
which
doesn't
appear
in
the
plan,
but
it's
the
euphemism
which
now
permeates
all
the
briefs...
401(a)(5)
says
that
the
difference
may
be
permitted
"because
of
any
retirement
benefits
created
under
state
or
federal
law.
"
now,
the
u.s.
brief
to
the
3rd
circuit
acknowledged
that
the
word
retirement
had
to
be
read
into
the
regulation
it
was
relying
on.
unless
the
conclusion
can
be
reached
that
men
suffer
disabilities
and
occupational
injuries
and
occupational
diseases
as
part
of
a
claimed
retirement
plan,
it
makes
a
mockery
of
this
law.
in
fact,
we
demonstrated
in
the
brief,
in
our
reply
brief
citing
the
legislative
history...
page
8
of
appellants'
reply
brief,
that
congress
intended
in
203(a)
supplemental
and
additional
requirements,
in
addition
to
401(a)(5),
even
a
401(a)(5)
as
a
tax
measure
for
anti
discrimination...
totally
unrelated
purposes...
made
any
sense.
but
i
am
constrained
to
point
out
to
the
court
in
the
light
of
the
argument
made
that
there
is
a
misquotation
in
the
appellees'
brief,
i'm
sure
inadvertent.
but
if
you
will
look
at
page
26
of
the
brief
of
appellees,
which
talks
about
the
alleged
change,
fact
that
there
is
no
change,
the
sentence
reads,
purporting
to
quote
from
the
committee
report:
"moreover,
the
conferees
intend
that
the
anti
discrimination
rules
of
present
law
are
not
to
be
changed.
"
the
legislative
history,
at
3
legislative
history
4544,
inserts
after
the
word
"law"
the
phrase,
"in
areas
other
than
the
vesting
schedule.
"
so
the
sentence
should
read:
"moreover,
the
conferees
intend
that
the
anti
discrimination
rules
of
present
law
in
areas
other
than
the
vesting
schedule
are
not
to
be
changed.
"
mr.
theodore
sachs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
sachs
the
words
i
just
read,
your
honor,
"in
areas
other
than
the
vesting
schedule.
"
and
of
course,
the
vesting
schedule
is
203(a).
and
that's
precisely
what
congress
was
adding
as
a
new
and
independent
requirement
which
did
not
previously
exist.
the
problem
with
the
arguments
of
appellees
is
they
make
203(a)
a
dead
letter.
you
don't
need
any
exceptions
for
203(a),
as
they
do
exist,
if
their
arguments
hold
any
water,
because
those
provisions
would
be
superfluous
and
they
would
be
redundant.
there's
no
need,
if
you
can
put
it
all
in
the
plan
and
write
it
off.
these
men
lost
their
benefits.
they
paid
for
them
with
their
livelihood,
and
those
benefits
should
be
restored.
thank
you,
your
honors.
