mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
much
the
same
as
the
virginia
case,
and
with
respect
to
at
least
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
commerce
clause,
i'm
pretty
much
content
to
rely
on
what
has
already
been
said
and
what's
said
in
the
brief.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
the
statutory
provisions
challenged
here
are
different
and
far
more
numerous
than
those
invalidated
by
the
virginia
district
court,
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
describing
briefly
the
portions
of
the
act
that
are
at
issue
here.
the
first
group
of
statutory
provisions
are
the
so-called
prime
farmland
provisions.
those
are
six
subsections
of
the
act
that
impose
special
requirements
where
a
mine
operator
proposes
to
undertake
surface
mining
operations
on
lands
that
satisfy
the
secretary
of
agriculture's
definition
of
prime
farmland...
and
this
is
something
that
tends
to
be
ignored
in
the
district
court's
consideration
of
the
case
and
in
appellees'
brief...
that
historically
have
been
used
for
intensive
agricultural
purposes.
so
this
is
just
not
some
land
that
someone
classifies
as
prime
farmland
on
the
basis
of
a
soil
sample.
this
is
land
that
has
been
used
intensively
for
agricultural
purposes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
not
what
the
statute
does,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
statute
only
says
that
if
surface
mining
is
undertaken
on
prime
farmland,
then
before
the
permit
is
issued
the
operator
has
to
to
demonstrate
that
his
technological
capability
to
restore
that
land
to
equivalent
or
higher
levels
of
yield
as
non-mined
prime
farmland
in
the
surrounding
area
under
equivalent
levels
of
management.
so
the
statute
simply
says
that
if
you've
got
prime
farmland
and
it's
been
used
as
prime
farmland,
and
you
propose
to
surface
mine
it,
when
you
finish
you've
got
to
put
it
back
into
the
same
productive
condition
that
it
was
in
before.
mr.
peter
buscemi
there
is
the
provision
that
there
has
to
be
revegetation
and
that
revegetation
has
to
exist
for
a
period
of
five
years.
there
is
some
question
about
how
the
act
is
interpreted
and
applied
in
this
respect.
the
secretary
issued
a
regulation
requiring
the
growing
of
row
crops.
that
regulation
was
invalidated
by
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
secretary
has
appealed
that
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
but
of
course
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
right
now
what
the
d.c.
circuit
will
do
or
whether
the
new
administration
will
continue
all
of
these
policies,
including
this
one.
so
that,
at
least,
as
for
right
now,
the
row
crop
regulation
is
not
in
effect
and
all
we're
talking
about
is
revegetation.
now,
the
operator
will
also
have
to
show
that
he
can
meet
the
soil
reconstruction
standards
for
prime
farmland.
they
require
that
the
different
topsoil
layers
be
removed
separately
and
restored
separately.
there
are
also
a
number
of
other
generally
applicable
provisions,
that
is,
not
applicable
only
to
prime
farmland,
that
were
challenged
in
the
indiana
case
and
not
in
the
virginia
case.
they
include
the
general
requirement
that
topsoil
be
removed
separately
and
the
general
requirement
for
the
submission
of
reclamation
plans
before
the
beginning
of
surface
mining.
these
plans
are
supposed
to
tell
the
regulatory
authority,
whether
it's
a
state
authority
or
the
federal
authority,
what
the
premining
use
of
the
land
is,
what
the
postmining
proposed
use
is,
and
describe
the
methods
by
which
the
postmining
use
will
be
achieved.
and
finally
there's
a
challenge
in
the
indiana
case
to
sections
522(a),
(c),
and
(d)
of
the
act,
also
not
challenged
in
the
virginia
case,
that
involve
the
establishment
of
procedures
for
designating
land
as
unsuitable
for
surface
mining.
section
522(e),
which
is
the
statute
that
prohibits
mining
within
specified
areas
of
roads,
schools,
parks,
and
churches,
and
so
on,
was
also
challenged
in
the
indiana
case
as
was
the
civil
penalty
provision.
now,
perhaps
i
can
talk
first,
since
i
didn't
reach
it
in
the
other
case,
about
the
just
compensation
clause
point.
in
this
case,
as
in
the
virginia
case,
our
first
position
is
that
the
just
compensation
argument
is
premature
here
because
we're
not
focussing
on
any
particular
piece
of
land.
that
makes
the
case
different
from
the
vast
majority
if
not
all
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
considered
taking
challenges
to
state
or
federal
regulatory
actions.
neither
the
plaintiffs
in
the
indiana
case
nor
those
in
the
virginia
case
have
focussed
on
any
particular
piece
of
property--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
this
court
said
in
agins
v.
tiburon,
just
last
term,
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
mere
enactment
of
the
statute
constitutes
a
taking,
because
we
don't
know
how
the
statute
is
going
to
apply
to
a
particular
piece
of
property.
we
can
evaluate
the
other
beneficial
uses
that
might
be
available
to
the
property
owner.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
tucker
act
certainly
does
provide
a
monetary
remedy
for
alleged
violations
of
the
constitution.
now
whether
the
tucker
act
would
give
a
remedy
to
an
individual
landowner
on
the
basis
of
a
regulatory
piece
of
legislation
like
this
is
something
that
has
not
really
been
addressed
by
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
one
indication
in
the
eastport
shipping
case
that
was
cited
in
the
brief
that
perhaps
the
court
of
claims
would
think
that
the
tucker
act
jurisdiction
does
not
go
that
far,
but
i
completely
agree,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act
is
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
by
the
court
before
addressing
this
just
compensation
clause
question
because
if
the
alleged
taking
of
a
particular
piece
of
property
can
be
redressed
through
the
providing
of
compensation,
then
there's
no
constitutional
violation,
because
the
just
compensation
clause
requires
only
compensation,
it
doesn't
prohibit--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
right.
and
i
think
that
it's
important...
i
mean,
i
think
that
that
just--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes,
it
is.
i
mean,
i
think
that
just
supports
the
general
notion
that
these
taking
questions
ought
to
be
addressed
in
the
context
of
the
application
of
the
statute
to
particular
pieces
of
property
rather
than
in
the
context
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
because
we
just
don't
know
how
the
statute
is
going
to
be
applied
in
a
particular
circumstance.
now,
i
do
want
to
say
in
connection
with
the
taking
argument
in
the
indiana
case
just
a
little
bit
about
this
high
levels
of
management
business
that
is
emphasized
by
the
district
court,
and
also
in
the
briefs
of
appellees.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
talks
about
high
levels
of
management
so
far
as
restoration
of
prime
farmland
to
productivity
levels
obtained
at
high
levels
of
management.
that's
something
that
the
district
courts
have
injected
into
the
case
by
saying
that
we're
going
to
define
high
levels
of
management
as
those
producing
yields
that
are
impossible
to
reach
after
surface
mining,
and
then
concluding
that
the
statute
imposes
an
impossible
burden.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
exactly.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
my
point
is
only
that
the
standard
is
not
high
levels
of
management,
as
if
that
is
something
separate
and
apart--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
all
it's
saying
is
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
right.
there's
the
question
of
reestablishing
the
yields
that
would
be
obtained
before
the
surface
mining
began.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
and
i
think,
by
the
way,
as
we
mention
in
our
brief
on
page
34,
note
20,
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
was
that
land
can
be
restored
to
its
levels
of
productivity
after
surface
mining.
this
is
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
exists
in
the
virginia
case
on
the
taking
question.
the
district
court
in
the
virginia
case
said
that
restoration
approximating
the
original
contour
is
physically
and
economically
impossible.
well,
that
just
ignored
the
finding
of
congress
to
the
contrary.
and
it
ignored
the
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
contrary,
it
ignored
the
pennsylvania
and
the
ohio
experience.
now,
finally,
in
connection
with
the
taking
argument,
i
just
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
analogy
here
to
the
nuisance
cases
or
the
noxious
use
cases.
this
is
a...
surface
mining
creates
much
of
the
same
kind
of
effect.
this
is
not
an
economic
enterprise
that
is
totally
without
its
disadvantages
to
the
surrounding
community.
congress
has
found
that
there
are
many
disadvantages.
and
in
that
respect
it's
very
much
like
the
brickyard
in
hadacheck
or
the
cedar
grove
in
miller
v.
schoene,
or
the
brewery
in
mugler.
all
of
these
things
have
their
value;
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
the
court
has
found
that
because
of
the
impact
on
the
surrounding
communities
there
is
room
for
regulation
without
a
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
i
think
that
those
cases
are
instructive
in
this
context.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
that's
right.
that's
what
i
was...
i
didn't
reach
that
in
the
virginia
case
and
i
did
want
to
address
it
briefly.
mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice,
i
thought
he
was
saying
both,
and
i
could
be
corrected
on
that,
but
we
did
quote
the
sentence
in
his...
on
page
110
of
the
appendix.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
the...
you
know,
that
letter
is
instructive
for
another
reason
as
well,
because
if
focuses
on
the
debate
that
was
in
congress
with
respect
to
the
prime
farmlands.
when
congress
considered
this,
there
was
a
recommendation
from
the
administration
that
surface
mining
be
banned,
or
at
least
that
a
moratorium
be
declared
on
surface
mining
on
prime
farmlands.
and
congress
decided
not
to
do
that.
and
the
reason
it
decided
not
to
do
it
was
because
its
investigation
indicated
that
the
land
could
be
properly
restored
after
surface
mining
was
completed.
and
that's
why
congress
chose
to
act
in
the
way
it
did,
rather
than
the
way
that
the
administration
had
requested.
and
i
think
mr.
conlon's
letter
is
addressed
to
the
moratorium
possibility.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
certainly
the
congress
thought
that
it
was
feasible.
and
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
indication
here
that
with
respect
to
any
particular
piece
of
property
it
is
not
feasible.
i
mean,
there
hasn't
been...
to
some
extent
this
statute
may
be
a
technology-forcing
statute.
we
don't
yet
know.
it
may
be
that
thus
far
surface
mined
prime
farmland
has
not
been
restored.
but
congress
at
least
thought
that
it
could
be
restored
to
the
equivalent
levels
of
yield
and
thus
far
that
has
not
been
shown
to
be
incorrect
with
respect
to
any
particular
piece
of
land.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
word
premature
implies
a
timing
element
that's
not
the
sole
content
of
the
argument.
what
we're
saying
really
is
that
if
a
particular
mine
operator
has
investigated
the
prospects
for
surface
mining
on
his
property
and
has
also
investigated
whatever
variance
procedures
may
be
available...
now
if
they're
not,
if
they're
not
available--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--on
the
prime
farms...
i'm
talking
of
the
virginia
case...
and
if
he's
further
investigated
the
possibility
of
restoring
the
land
and
he's
concluded
on
the
basis
of
all
of
that
information
that
it
is
either
impossible
or
impractical,
and
moreover
he's
concluded
that
there
are
no
other
beneficial
uses
of
this
land,
then
it
may
be
appropriate
for
him
to
come
and
say
that,
well,
my
property
has
been
taken.
but--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
but
i
think
the
application
of
the
statute
may
well
vary
from
place
to
place.
it
may
be--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
one
of
the
critical
inquiries
that
the
court
engages
in
when
it
looks
to
see
whether
there
has
been
a
taking
is
to
look
at
the
other
uses
for
the
property.
and
that's
why
we're
talking
merely
about
the
focus
on
a
particular
piece
of
property
rather
than
on
the
mere
enactment--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
at
least
that
historically
has
had
this
intensive
agricultural
cultivation.
whether
in
the
immediate
year
or
two
before
mining,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessarily
the
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
regardless
of
of
what
it's
being
used
for
at
the
time,
there
may
be
other
beneficial
uses
that
are
available
for
that
land.
i
mean,
the
court
said
in
andrus
v.
allard
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
bundle
of
property
rights,
not
just
to
a
single
strand.
but
if
it
turns
out
that
this
land
is
usable
not
only
for
farming
but
also
for
an
airport
and
also
for
any
number
of
other
things,
that
may
well
color
the
way
the
court
will
look
at
a
taking
question
focused
solely
on
the
operation
of
the
surface
mining
act.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
but,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
that's
a
very
good
example
of
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make.
there
was
a
particular
piece
of
property
involved
in
that
case.
that
was
a
case
that
was
brought
by
a
particular
property
owner
to
prevent
the
homeowner
from
taking
advantage
of
the
pennsylvania
state
law.
i
don't
know
what
the
relief
was
that
was
granted
in
that
case,
whether
it
was
an
across-the-board
injunction
or
whether
it
was
an
injunction
strictly
speaking
that
ran
only
to
that
one
piece
of
land,
but
in
any
event
the
critical
point
is
that
the
challenge
was
made
in
the
context
of
a
particular
factual
situation.
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
holmes'
opinion
for
the
court
focused
on
the
private
relationship
between
the
coal
company
and
the
landowner.
the
court
was
simply
unwilling
to
allow
the
landowner
to
rely
on
this
intervening
pennsylvania
state
law
to
get
out
from
under
the
burden
of
his
bargain
that
he
had
struck
on
an
arm's
length
basis.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
mahon
that
the
court
disagreed
with
the
general
principle
stated
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
dissent,
which
i
believe
was
joined
by
several
other
members
of
the
court.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
mahon,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
the...
at
least,
as
to
the
section
522(e)
of
the
act,
which
is
also
part
of
this
taking
problem,
the
valid
existing
rights
provision
in
522(e)
might
well
have
obviated
the
mahon
problem
if
it
were
to
arise
under
the
act
in
connection
with
one
of
the
prohibitions
in
522(e).
now,
that's
not
true,
of
course,
with
respect
to
the
prime
farmlands,
because
that's
not
subject
to
valid
existing
rights.
but
i
just
do
want
to
make
that
point.
finally,
i
do
want
to
address
just
briefly
the
due
process
clause
challenges
here.
there
are
two
of
them.
the
first
one
deals
with
the
summary
cessation
order
procedure
under
521(a)(2).
now,
again,
we
begin
with
the
same
kind
of
argument.
no
one
in
indiana
and
perhaps
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
virginia
case...
but
that
was
not
in
the
record
at
trial...
but
as
far
as
we
know
from
the
record,
certainly,
none
of
these
people
have
ever
been
subjected
to
summary
cessation
orders,
or
to
the
imposition
of
civil
penalties.
and
we
think
that
under
those
circumstances
the
due
process
challenge
is
premature
and
that
i
mean
in
a
real
timing
sense,
rather
that
as
far
as
focusing
on
a
particular
case.
we
just
haven't
had
these
things
apply
to
these
plaintiffs
yet.
in
any
event,
we
don't
think
that
either
the
civil
penalty
provisions
in
section
518
or
the
summary
cessation
orders
deprive
mine
operators
of
due
process.
the
only
time
that
a
cessation
order
will
be
issued
in
a
summary
fashion
before
there's
notice
given
and
an
opportunity
for
abatement
is
when
the
inspector
determines
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
or
a
violation
of
the
permit
condition
that
creates
an
imminent
danger
to
the
health
or
safety
of
the
public,
or
is
causing
or
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
cause
significant
imminent
environmental
harm
to
the
land
air
or
water
resources.
now,
that
standard,
we
suggest,
is
very
similar
to
standards
that
this
court
has
already
upheld
for
summary
administrative
action.
and
also
other
federal
courts,
such
as
the
fourth
circuit,
in
sink
v.
morton,
arose
under
the
mine
safety
and
health
act,
but
involves
very
similar
standing.
now,
of
course,
the
district
court
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
some
of
these
summary
cessation
orders
may
have
been
issued
to
mine
operators
other
than
the
plaintiffs
erroneously
and
in
the
first
few
months
of
the
statute's
effectiveness
i
gather
that
there
were
a
small
number
of
erroneous
summary
cessation
orders.
in
fact,
the
one
that
was
issued
to
paramount
mining
corporation,
which
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
virginia
case,
was
issued
erroneously
and
it
was
reversed
approximately
two
months
later
when
there
was
an
administrative
hearing
held.
and
in
the
interim
there
is
no
indication
whatever
that
there
was
any
harm
suffered
by
the
company.
it
was
simply
a
question
of
whether
they
could
dump
spoil
in
one
area
rather
than
another.
but,
in
any
event,
that's
not
the
relevant
inquiry,
and
i
just
want
to
make
that
point
clear.
the
question
is
not
whether
inspectors
may
have
made
errors
in
particular
cases,
but
whether
the
whole
process
is
deficient.
we
don't
think
that
it
is,
because
congress
could
legitimately
decide
that
when
an
on-site
inspection
reveals
such
an
imminent
danger
to
the
public
or
to
the
environment,
something
has
to
be
done
about
it
beforehand.
and
then
congress
has
tried
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
mine
operator
by
allowing
him
to
seek
temporary
relief
from
the
secretary
and
requiring
the
secretary
to
react
in
five
days,
in
that
circumstance.
now,
with
respect
to
the
civil
penalty
provisions,
there
are
just
a
few
points
to
be
made.
first
of
all,
there
are
no
penalties
that
are
finally
imposed
until
after
there
has
been
full
administrative
review
of
it.
mr.
peter
buscemi
you
have
to
pay
the
penalty
only
if
you
wish
to
seek
review
of
the
amount
of
penalty.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
don't
know
if
there's
precedent
for
the
particular
procedure
of
paying
a
civil
penalty
under,
you
know,
one
of
these--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--but
there's
certainly
a
deprivation
of
property
before
a
hearing.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
and
i
think
this
is--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--this
is...
exactly.
i
think
this
is
analogous
to
to
that.
mr.
peter
buscemi
exactly.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
when
the
congress
had
found
that
under
the
mine
safety
and
health
act
there
was
a
substantial
difficulty
in
collecting
civil
penalties
from
mine
operators,
and
i
think
that
that's
what
pushed
congress
into
enacting
the
statute.
i
think
that
the
secretary
in
interpreting
and
applying
the
statute
has
found
that
generally
speaking
mine
operators
who
are
willing
to
seek
administrative
review
at
all
are
mine
operators
who
are
willing
to
pay
the
penalties,
if
administrative
review
ultimately
results
in
their
being
found
liable.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
don't
think...
see,
that's
the
point,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
not
true.
they
can
seek
administrative
review
and
obtain
a
full
review
of
the
fact
of
the
violation
as
the
secretary
has
been
applying
the
act
without
paying
any
money
in.
that's
the
point
that
i
want
to
make.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
true,
but
my
point
is
that
the
reason
the
secretary
has
permitted
this
and
has
not
interpreted...
a
large
part
of
the
reason
the
secretary
has
not
insisted
on
payment
under
518,
even
to
obtain
review
of
the
fact
of
the
violation,
is
that
the
biggest
problem
that
the
secretaries
of
interior
and
labor
have
had
under
these
statutes
in
mine
operation
was
more
the
process
altogether
and
not
mine
operators
who
come
in
seeking
administrative
review
and
then
try
to
refuse
to
pay.
i
mean,
that
is...
by
experience
that's
not
been
the
problem.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
is
analogous,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
here
we
have
an
interest-bearing
account.
it's
not
as
though
the
use
of
the
money
is
being--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--it's
not
as
if
they're
losing
the
use
of
the
money
during
that
time.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
true;
that's
true.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
certainly
agree,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
a
private
landowner
who
claims
a
taking
can
bring
a
tucker
act
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
whether
the
court
of
claims
will
find
that
the
tucker
act
jurisdiction
was
intended
to
permit
recovery
on
the
basis
of
a
regulatory
statute
like
this,
or
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
called
earlier,
inverse
condemnation,
i'm
not
certain.
i
don't
know
whether
the
tucker
act
jurisdiction
has
ever
been
invoked
in
a
case
like
that
and
has
resulted
in
a
monetary
recovery.
as
i
say,
in
the
eastport
shipping
case
that
we've
cited,
the
court
of
claims,
i
think,
expressed
some
misgivings
about
that.
i
don't
know
what
the
court
would
do
if
it
were
faced
with
the
question,
but
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
opposing
counsel
just
now
indicates
what
the
government
would
see
as
the
way
in
which
this
kind
of
issue
can
be
appropriately
resolved,
and
that
is
if
an
individual
mine
operator
or
prospective
mine
operator
or
landowner
applies
for
a
permit
to
mine
a
certain
kind
of
land,
and
he
maintains
that
he
just
does
not
have
the
capability
to
restore
it
to
its
equivalent
levels
of
yield--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--or
he
does
his
best
and
the
government
says
he
failed.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
you
can
certainly
assume
that
one
of
two
things
available
to
a
private
owner,
if
he
can
establish
that
his
property
has
been
taken:
you
can
assume
either
that
there
is
a
court
of
claims
remedy
under
the
tucker
act
for
money
damages,
or
that
at
least
with
respect
to
a
particular
piece
of
property,
that
there
is
a
district
court
equitable
remedy
available
in
the
form
of
an
injunction
under
the
statute
as
applied
to
that
statute,
and
that's
the
problem
that
we
encounter
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
right
now,
at
least,
we're
confronted
with
plaintiffs
who
would
be
very
happy
with
an
injunction.
that's
exactly
what
they
want.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
and
that's
presumably
all
that
they
want.
so
i
think
that
that's
how
we
would
envision
the
thing
working.
mr.
peter
buscemi
absolutely
not.
but--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
would
say
that
they
would
not
win
on
the
merits,
but
mr.
justice
powell's
question,
i
thought,
was
what
do
they
do
and
how
do
they
go
about
it.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
that
statement
is
correct
under
this
court's
decisions.
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
a
taking.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
because
i
think
that
part
of
mr.
justice
powell's
hypothetical
was
that
no
other
beneficial
use
would
be
available.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that
would
be
the
case,
if
they--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
under
those
circumstances
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
not
find
a
taking.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
the
new
york
landmark
statute
made
the
thirty-foot
house
above
grand
central
station
unusable
too,
but
the
court
sustained
that.
and
i
think
that
that
is
typical
of
the
court's
approach
in
these
taking
questions.
it
has
looked
at
the
entire
bundle
of
of--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
think
that
that
would
not
be
a
taking;
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
commerce
clause
question,
as
i
say,
i
will
give
essentially
the
same
answer
that
i
gave
you
earlier,
and
that
is
that
congress
would
have
to
find
that
that
was
a
reasonable
measure
under
the
commerce
clause.
but
i
think
that
my
answer
is
that
under
the
circumstances,
and
what
we
already
have
seen
in
the
legislative
record,
that
probably
would
be
defended
under
the
commerce
clause.
after
all,
the
very
task
force
report
that
plaintiffs
rely
on
and
the
district
court
relied
on
has
established
that
21
million
acres
of
prime
farmland
is
subject
to
surface
mining.
and
right
now,
of
course,
as
it
turns
out,
the
problem
has
not
gotten
to
that
dimension
yet.
we
only
have
approximately
21-,
22,000
acres
a
year
that
are
being
mined.
but
i
think
that
the...
i'm
sorry,
did
i
say
twenty?
it's
seven
million
acres,
which
is
an
area
larger
than
the
state
of
delaware.
i
think
that's
a
substantial
figure
and
i
think
that
congress
could
rely
on
it
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
true,
and
that's
the
situation
that
was
presented
to
the
court
in
pennsylvania
coal
v.
mahon.
and
if
the
court
had
a
situation
like
that
and
if
the
court
further
found
that
there
was
just
no
other
way
for
the
mine
operator,
prospective
mine
operator
to
make
use
of
his
property,
then
a
taking
might
be
found
there.
i'm
not...
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that
would
depend
on
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
at
law.
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
that
event
compensation
would
be
adequate.
my
hesitation
is
only
because
i
do
not
know
of
any
court
of
claims
case
that
has
compensated
a
landowner
for
federal
action
of
this
regulatory
nature.
if
the
compensation
were
available,
there
would
be
no
equitable
relief.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
correct.
the
virginia
situation--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
correct.
the
virginia
situation
may
well
present
different
geographical
characteristics
but
i
should
also
point
out,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
the
district
court
also
found
that
if
some
of
that
land
was
leveled
off
into
benches,
it
went
up
to
$300,000
an
acre.
so,
i
mean,
there's
a
little
bit
of
inconsistency
there.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you.
