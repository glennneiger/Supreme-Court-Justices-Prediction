justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kelly,
at
some
convenient
point
in
your
argument
will
you
address
the
question
of
what
remedies
if
any
individual
landowners
would
have,
assuming
the
government
wins
this
case?
and
assuming
also
an
individual
landowner
can
prove
that
all
beneficial
use
of
his
property
has
been
denied
him
by
the
enforcement
of
this
statute?
you
address
it
at
your
convenience.
i
just
don't
want
it
overlooked.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
may
be
as
adequate
as
anybody
can
inform
me
today,
but
i
really
don't
understand
what
opportunities
property
owners
will
have
if
they
can
prove
later,
assuming
the
government
wins,
that
they
can
prove
that
they
have
no
beneficial
interest
left
in
their
proper
as
a
result
of
this
act.
justice
jr.
maybe
the
solicitor
general
should
address
that
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
him.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
buscemi,
do
you
agree
that
the
tucker
act
will
be
available
to
a
private
landowner
who
claims
a
taking?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
deciding
this
case,
should
we
assume
that
there
may
be
an
opportunity
to
litigate
in
the
event
a
private
owner
thinks
his
property
has
been
taken?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
buscemi,
in
virginia,
in
southwest
virginia
where
there
are
only
steep
hills
but
no
farmland
or
very
little
farmland,
the
district
judge
in
the
virginia
case
found
that
in
many
instances
the
land
had
no
value
whatever
under
the
administration
of
this
act,
so
that
could
conceivably
be
different
from
land
in
another
state
where
an
individual
or
a
company
owned
both
the
surface
and
the
mineral
rights.
he
could
continue
to
farm
that
land.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
virginia
you
could
own
a
mountainside
that
had
no
utility
in
the
world
other
than
to
strip
mine.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i've
seen
a
few
mountaintops
taken
off,
but
not
many.
