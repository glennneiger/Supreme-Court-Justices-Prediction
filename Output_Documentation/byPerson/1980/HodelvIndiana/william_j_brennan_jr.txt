justice
jr.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that,
mr.
buscemi.
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
if
the
tucker
act
in
just
compensation
cases
reaches
only
eminent
domain
cases,
that
is
where
the
government
initiates
the
condemnation,
if
that's
all,
then
we
do
have
a
constitutional
question.
whereas
if
the
tucker
act
reaches
also
so-called
inverse
condemnation,
whether
regulation
or
whatever
it
may
be,
in
and
of
itself,
constitutes
a
taking
and
provides
compensation,
then
we
don't
reach
the
constitutional
question?
justice
jr.
is
that
true
also
in
the
other
case?
justice
jr.
well,
what
happens
in
that
case
if
he
doesn't
want
an
injunction,
he
wants
damages?
