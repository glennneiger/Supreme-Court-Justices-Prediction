justice

stewart
well,
the
statute
requires
a
comparison
with
the
same
level
of
management
as
had
heretofore
been
given.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if,
in
the
past,
that
level
had
been
a
high
level
of
management,
then
there's
sense
in
what
the
district
court
said,
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
equivalent
level
of
management?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
same
level
of
management.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
level
anterior
to
the
strip
mining
has
been
a
high
level
of
management,
then
one
must
compare
what
a
high
level
of
management
would
produce
after
the
strip
mining.
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
same
level
of
management?
justice
stewart
this
is
the
procedural
due
process
issue?
justice
stewart
seizing
property?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
have
to
be
willing
in
order
to
seek
administrative
review.
that
is
the
point.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
they
lose...
they
can't
quarrel
about
the
amount.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose,
if
a
plaintiff
claims
that
his
property
has
been
taken
by
the
government
without
compensation,
and
if
the
government
is
the
federal
government,
as
it
is
here,
he
can
under
the
tucker
act
go
into
the
court
of
claims
and
make
that
claim,
and
claim
for
compensation
for
the
taking
of
his
property,
can't
he,
at
any
time?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
becomes
an
issue
in
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly,
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
compensated
for
property
that
is
taken
from
you
by
the
federal
government.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
would
think
that
it
wouldn't
take
too
ingenious
a
lawyer
to
file
such
a
complaint.
justice
stewart
but
some
of
these
coal
companies
don't
own
the
farmland
as
farmland.
they
just
own
the
minerals
under
it,
and
certainly
any
such
legislation
as
described
hypothetically
by
my
brother
white
would
take
all
of
their
property,
wouldn't
it?
