justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
your
position
that
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
can
freeze
that
classification?
if
it
was
once
used
as
prime
farmland,
it's
going
to
be
prime
farmland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
interpreting
a
california
statute
where
the
california
courts
had
held
there
was
no
such
thing
as
inverse
condemnation.
and
as
i
understand,
the
tucker
act
provides
that
there
is
inverse
condemnation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
goes
to
the
taking
argument
and
not
to
the
commerce
clause
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
following
up
on
justice
stevens'
question,
how
do
you
treat
a
case
such
as
mahon
v.
pennsylvania
coal
company,
in
which
justice
holmes'
opinion
says
the
regulation
is
unconstitutional
because
you've
crossed
the
boundary
between
regulation
and
taking?
and
it
was
an
action
to
have
the
regulation
declared
unconstitutional.
but
there
was
no
particular
property
involved,
it
was
the
statewide
regulation
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
an
analogy
to
a
supersedeas
bond
in
a
regular
trial
court
civil
damages
action
where
you
can
appeal,
but
you
have
to
post
a
bond
in
order
to
prevent
a
levy
on
your
property
if
you
have
lost
as
a
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
haven't
had
the...
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
you
haven't
had
the
full
hearing
and
then
tried
to
appeal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
national
league
of
cities
depended
upon
the
fact
that
the
subjects
of
the
regulation
were
themselves
states,
did
it
not?
is
it
the
contention
of
indiana
here
that
indiana
or
its
subsidiary
municipal
corporations
own
prime
farmland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
it's
justifiable
under
the
commerce
clause?
