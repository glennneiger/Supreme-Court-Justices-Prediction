mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
mr.
justice
powell,
i
will
do
that
at
the
end.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
the
government
has
articulated
the
main
difference
between
the
indiana
case
and
the
virginia
case,
and
that
is
that
we
encompass
some
21
different
or
additional
subsections
of
the
statute,
and
before
getting
into
the
tenth
amendment
issue
or
the
federalism
issue
i
would
like
to
go
into
some
further
explanation
of
the
various
sections
of
the
statute
that
are
involved
under
the
tenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
commerce
clause.
we
have
divided
those
into
four
basic
groups,
and
the
first
group
would
be
the
prime
farmland
provisions.
and
i
don't
think
at
this
point
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
effect
of
the
prime
farmland
provisions.
the
effects
of
the
prime
farmland
provisions,
quite
simply,
are
that
at
the
conclusion
of
taking
the
coal
out
of
the
ground
you've
got
to
put
everything
back
in,
in
three
separate
layers,
and
that
land
has
to
be
farmed,
minimally,
for
five
years.
and
as
the
district
court
in
the
star
coal
company
case
in
ohio
found...
or
in
iowa
found,
it
may
even
take
20
years
of
farming
to
get
that
land
back
to
the
point
of
equivalent
levels
of
yield
under
high
levels
of
management.
that
term,
high
levels
of
management,
as
an
aside
here,
is
found
in
the
act.
"high
levels
of
management"
were
used
by
the
secretary.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
where
it
comes
from.
but
in
any
event,
prime
farmland
provisions
were
intended
by
congress
to
require
a
farming
use
and
allowed
no
other
uses,
no
other
variances.
it
was
expressed
by
at
least
three
senators
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
at
the
time
it
was
introduced.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
expressed
in
the
terms,
we
don't
want
any
state
bureaucrat
to
have
the
discretion
to
allow
some
other
land
use.
and
that's
how
it
was
expressed.
and
that's
how
it
was
put
in
the
act,
and
that
is
the
way
it's
going
to
be
enforced
either
by
the
federal
government
or
by
the
states
under
the
threat
of
the
federal
government.
now,
the
government
has
said
that
this
is
the
regulation
of
private
activity.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thrust
goes
far
beyond
private
activity.
it
goes
directly
into
land
use.
and
i
think
that
under
the
tenth
amendment
issue,
at
least,
the
initial
question
that
must
be
decided
is,
what
is
land
use
planning
and
activity
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned
and
in
relationship
to
national
league
of
cities,
that's
been
heretofore
decided?
and
to
me,
i
think
national
league
of
cities
was
the
beginning,
at
least,
of
defining
what
is
an
area
of
sovereignty
in
which
the
federal
government
cannot
intrude
that's
going
to
be
held
to
the
states?
and
it
also
started
to
state
what
it's
not
going
to
be.
and
quite
candidly
with
the
court,
i
don't
think
i
can
say
that
land
use
planning
is
wholly
a
governmental
service,
if
you
will,
but
i
can
certainly
say
it
is
not
simply
the
regulation
of
private
activities
relating
directly
to
commerce.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
precisely
what
was
said
in
there,
but
i
think
there
were
two
things
that
were
important
to
the
court
in
nlc.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
was
important
was
that
there
was
a
direct
command
speaking
to
the
state.
i
think
the
second
thing
that
was
important
was
what
it
spoke
about,
and
maybe
what
it
spoke
about
was
more
important
than
that
it
actually
did
speak
to
the
state.
and
i
think
land
use
planning,
if
we
are
to
make
a
comparison
to
the
second
tier,
if
you
will,
of
national
league
of
cities,
i
think
it's
much
more
akin
to
that
than
anything
else.
i
think
land
use
planning
and
control
involves
matters
that
transcend
mere
economics
and
commerce.
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
what
a
community's
going
to
be
like.
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
it
on
many
different
occasions,
land
use
planning
is
an
instrument
to
create
a
quality
of
life
and
a
character
within
a
community.
now,
if
this
power...
of
the
states,
if
you
will;
it's
used
to
do
that...
it
seems
to
me
is
equal
to
the
services
that
were
relied
upon,
at
least
in
part,
in
national
league
of
cities
to
get
the
court
to
where
it
got.
now,
to
carry
it
one
step
further,
i
think
within
the
tenth
amendment
there
is
room...
and
i
think
it
is
in
the
intent,
if
you
will,
of
the
framers...
that
the
states
not
only
were
to
be
a
government
to
give
governmental
services.
the
states...
if
a
state
is
going
to
be
a
government,
it
has
to
have
something
more
than
the
right
to
have
employees
to
run
police
departments
and
schools
and
hospitals.
a
state,
i
believe,
must
have
some
independent
sphere
of
governance.
i
can't
say
that
that
is
precisely
what
national
league
of
cities
said,
but
i
think,
if
our
constitutional
framework
is
to
make
any
sense
whatsoever,
if
the
states
are
to
govern,
if
they're
to
have
some
degree
of
independence,
there
must
be
then
some
independent
sphere
of
government,
or
governance,
if
you
will.
i
think
the
only
real
question
remaining
after
national
league
of
cities
would
be,
how
is
that
to
be
defined,
where
are
we
to
go
with
that?
and
i
think
that
once
an
area
like
land
use
planning
comes
before
the
court
and
it
has
the
attributes
that
land
use
planning
does,
and
that
is
that
it
concerns
matters
that
are
so
peculiar
to
each
given
community
they
can
only
be
determined
by
looking
at
a
wide
diversity
of
climate,
geography,
geology,
preferences,
and
character.
and
when
you
are
required
to
come
to
different
policies
based
on
these
peculiar
matters
that
are
so
central
locally,
i
think
that
may
well
qualify
as
an
independent
sphere
of
governance.
i
think
as
chief
justice
burger's
question
at
the
outset,
as
to
what
does
the
tenth
amendment
mean,
i
think
it
has
to
mean
that
there
is
some
sphere
of
governance
left
to
the
states.
and
i
think
part
of
that
has
to
be
land
use
planning
and
control.
and
i
think
once
that
issue
and
question
is
resolved,
i
think
the
next
problem
is,
where
do
we
go
from
there?
because
we
admit,
in
the
state
of
indiana,
and
the
coal
companies
admit,
that
there
is
in
fact
areas,
possibly,
where
land
use
planning
might
become
tangentially
involved.
we
cannot
take
the
position
that
it
is
always
separate
and
apart
from
the
power
of
the
federal
government.
and
we
would
propose
that
if
this
is
a
central
right,
if
you
will,
under
the
first
ten
amendments,
that
the
court
simply
go
into
the
weighing
and
balancing
process
that
it
has
gone
into
in
making
these
types
of
determinations
in
other
amendment
cases.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
well,
i
would
certainly
think
that
to
the
extent
that
nuclear
waste
had
a
potential
for
an
interstate
spillover
effect,
from
one
state
to
another,
that
this
might
be
an
area
where
the
federal
interest
might
indeed
be
permanent.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
well,
i
think
even
if
there
is
a
compelling
national
interest
here,
at
least
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
cases
where
you
have
a
suspect
class,
there
is
still
the
next
level
of
inquiry,
and
that
is,
is
there
a
less
intrusive
means
of
doing
this?
in
other
words,
just
finding
a
paramount
national
interest
in
the
sense
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
cases,
as
i
would
understand
it,
is
not
sufficient.
the
court
would
then
have
to
focus
on
the
nature
and
the
means
that
the
federal
government
did
use.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
i
think
so,
mr.
justice;
yes.
definitely.
i
don't
think
there
are
any
absolute
lines,
and
i
think
that's
why
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court
may
want
to
go
into
a
fourteenth
amendment
type
of
analysis.
i
think
it
does
this
in
other
commerce
clause
situations
where
the
federal
government
has
not
stepped
in
with
regulations
and
a
state
has
stepped
in
and
is
regulated,
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
that's
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
the
court
looks
to
the
policy
that
the
state
is
pursuing
when
it
does
come
into
that
area,
and
it
balances
whether
or
not
the
benefits
of
the
state
policy
are
out
of
proportion
or
in
proportion
to
the
burdens
on
interstate
commerce
that
are
created
by
it.
so
i
don't
think
the
test
that
we're
suggesting
is
anything
that's
unfamiliar
to
this
court
in
the
past,
and
in
fact,
i
think
it's
very
consistent
with
it.
and
insofar
as
weighing
these
facts,
i
would
like
to
go
for
a
minute
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
effects
on
the
state
of
indiana
with
regard
to
the
prime
farmland
provisions.
i
think...
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
where
they
came
from...
i
think
the
prime
farmland
provisions
came
from
land
use
policies,
a
land
use
conflict,
if
you
will,
in
the
state
of
illinois.
i
think
you
can
trace
right
through
the
senate
history.
and
over
there
the
state
of
illinois
has
an
abundance
of
underground
mineable
reserves.
eighty
percent
of
their
coal
reserves
are
mineable
by
the
underground
method.
indiana
to
date...
less
than
one
percent
of
our
actual
coal
is
mined
by
the
underground
method.
we
cannot
mine
coal
in
indiana
by
the
underground
method.
we
do
not
have
the
conflict
between
surface
mine
and
prime
farmland
that's
present
in
the
state
of
illinois.
and
the
state
of
illinois
dealt
with
this
problem.
although
senator
stevenson
said
he
didn't
like
the
state
bureaucrat
having
the
discretion
to
do
what
they
were
going
to
do
in
illinois...
that
is
to
say,
whether
to
use
this
prime
farmland
or
not,
indiana
doesn't
have
that
problem.
but
we
have
six
counties
in
southern
indiana
whose
whole
way
of
life
is
wrapped
up
with
coal
mining.
it
has
come
to
life
in
the
last
ten
years
because
of
coal
mining.
we
have
one
county
down
there,
50
percent
of
its
tax
revenues
are
directly
related
to
surface
coal
mining.
that
is
related
to
land
use.
that
is
how
integral
land
use
is
to
the
character
and
quality
of
a
community.
it
stands
based
upon
dictates
from
far
away,
people,
senators,
who
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
in
southern
indiana.
they
would
no
more
recognize
a
high
wall
in
a
four-foot
seam
of
coal
than
contour
mining,
and
they
really
wouldn't
know
what
it's
all
about.
but
they
do
in
southern
indiana,
they
deal
with
the
problem.
in
fact,
prior
to
the
1977
surface
mining,
our
two-way
water
quality
study
showed
that
surface
mining
in
the
state
of
indiana
was
not...
and
i
repeat,
not
contributing
to
the
interstate
spillover.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
there
certainly
has,
your
honor.
there
has,
but
insofar
as
surface
mining
in
illinois
is
concerned,
only
about
50
percent
of
their
coal
is
produced
by
surface
mining.
fifty
percent
is
produced
by
underground
mining.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
i
use
that
for
the
split,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
50
percent
of
their
present
production
is
mined
by
underground
coal,
the
underground
method.
in
indiana
less
than
one
percent
is
mined
by
the
underground
method.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
i
think
also
attention
needs
to
be
focused
upon
section
522
and
the
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
force
the
states
to
zone
land
as
unsuitable
for
surface
mining.
i
have
a
very,
very
difficult
time
conceiving
of
any
relationship
whatsoever
of
the
zoning
of
land
as
being
unsuitable
for
surface
mining
and
its
connection
to
interstate
commerce.
try
as
i
might,
i
find
it
inconceivable
that
there
is
any
connection
whatsoever.
insofar
as
522(e)
and
(4)
are
concerned,
they
don't
deal
with
surface
mining
of
coal.
they
deal
with
surface
mining
operations.
we,
the
industry,
can't
even
drive
a
truck,
if
you
will,
within
300
feet
of
a
cemetery.
now
what
is
the
relationship
to
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
burger
asked
about
life.
counsel
went
to
darby.
but
the
justification
in
darby
was
not
the
life.
it
had
to
do
with
the
unfair
method
of
competition
that
the
court
found.
it
found
a
justifiable
effect
on
interstate
commerce
to
protect
tangentially
the
life.
there
is
no
tangential
or
even
indirect
effect
on
commerce
that's
protected
by
anything
within
section
522.
and
insofar
as
the
approximate
original
contour
provision
is
concerned,
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause,
we
cannot
find,
i
could
not
find,
the
district
court
could
not
find
anything
within
the
entire
history
of
this
act
before
the
senate
that
would
relate
approximate
original
contour
to
any
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
even
if
we
went
to
water
pollution.
all
of
the
justification,
all
of
the
justification
mentioned
by
the
senate,
the
house,
went
to
water
pollution
on
steep
slopes
and
mountain
tops.
it
didn't
have
a
thing
to
do
with
water
pollution
on
flat
land.
and
in
indiana
we
have
areas
that
are
not
flat
but
they
aren't
steep
slope.
and
because
of
the
approximate
original
contour,
insofar
as
land
use
is
concerned,
we
couldn't
go
out
and
build
an
airport
on
that
after
we
mined
it.
approximate
original
contour
would
restrict
the
land
use
of
that,
at
least
until
after
revegetation
is
completed.
either
under
the
commerce
clause
or
under
the
tenth
amendment,
the
original
contour
falls,
either
way.
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment...
unless
the
court
would
have
any
questions
at
this
point
on
either
the
commerce
clause
arguments
or
the
tenth
amendment,
i'll
proceed
to
the
fifth.
coming
down
to
the
fifth
amendment,
i
think
the
first
question
i'd
like
to
deal
with,
and
that
is
the
tucker
act.
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
is
not
at
all
certain
that
the
federal
government
is
going
to
be
the
government
that
is
using
or
regulated
by
the
prime
farmland
provisions,
nor
is
it
certain
that
they're
going
to
be
the
regulatory
agency
under
522,
so
how
can
it
be
said
that
the
tucker
act
is
going
to
be
an
adequate
remedy?
it
may
not
even
be
the
federal
government.
it
may
be
the
state
of
indiana.
and
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
timeliness
of
the
remedy
is
concerned,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
states
who
i
believe
and
as
the
indiana
legislature
so
found...
which
is
entitled
to
some
degree
of
presumption
of
rationality...
it
is
being
coerced
into
enacting
these
provisions...
i
think
this
court
would,
ought
to
be
concerned
with
whether
this
is
going
to
be
a
taking
and
the
state's
going
to
have
to
pay
for
it.
how
can
the
states
evaluate
whether
or
not
they
want
to
enact
522
or
the
prime
farmland
provisions
when
they
don't
know
whether
it's
going
to
cost
them
$1
or
$50
million?
so,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
strong
public
policy
behind
proceedings
with
a
decision
of
the
taking
issues,
because
the
states
are
sitting
back...
some
of
them
have
enacted
statutes;
they're
submitting
programs;
they
need
to
know.
and
if
it
is
a
taking,
and
a
wrongful
taking,
they
may
not
want
to
have
those
provisions
be
a
part
of
their
program
because
they
may
not
be
able
to
afford
it.
insofar
as
the
high
level
of
management
is
concerned,
again--
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
--only
insofar
as
prohibiting
mining
in
the
indiana
case.
we
challenged,
and
the
district
court
found
with
respect
to
the
prime
farmland
that
it
presents
an
unconstitutional
taking
because
of
the
high
level
of
management
potential
that
we
have
to
meet
in
restoring,
and
the
fact
that
we
could
not
get
a
permit
to
do
that
because
we
couldn't
prove
we
could
do
it.
so
therefore
we
couldn't
mine
the
coal.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
insofar
as
surface
mining
in
indiana
is
concerned,
we
have...
and
i
think
it's
in
exhibit
three,
mr.
justice
stevens,
sets
forth
the
nature
of
the
surface
mineable
reserves
and
the
extent
of
the
prime
farmland.
now,
that
shows
it
to
be
fairly
extensive.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
all
of
the
dark
green
is
75
percent
prime
farmland
and
the
yellow
is
25
percent
prime
farmland.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
there
is
no
coal.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
and
i
think
that
is
something
that's
quite
obvious
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
the
land
use
concept
in
indiana.
we
have
a
map
in
here
that
shows
where
the
prime
farmland
is
throughout
the
state,
and
we
also
have
a
map
that
shows
where
it
is
overlying
the
coal,
and
i
think
the
illustration
is
quite
dramatic
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
the
conflict
between
prime
farmland.
the
highest
quality
and
the
best
prime
farmland,
anyone
from
the
state
of
indiana
knows,
is
up
north.
and
even
what
the
federal
government
has
labeled
as
prime
farmland
down
there,
there
isn't
a
farmer
in
the
state
of
indiana
that
would
call
that
prime
farmland.
prime
farmland
up
north
is
$4,500
an
acre.
you
can't
find
$4,500
an
acre
prime
farmland
in
southern
indiana.
the
six
counties
that
account
for
80
percent
of
the
product
of
coal
account
for
four
percent
of
the
production
of
agricultural
products.
there
is
no
conflict
down
there.
but
in
any
event,
i've
digressed
a
little
bit
away
from
the
taking,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
the
remedies
question,
insofar
as
mr.
justice
powell
has
asked,
i
think
i've
addressed
myself
to
that
insofar
as
the
tucker
act
is
concerned.
did
that
adequately
respond
to
your
inquiry
at
the
outset?
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
i
think
that
issue
will--
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
--i
think
i
can
only
make
one
statement
in
that
regard,
and
that
is
that
most
coal
companies
in
indiana
own
or
lease
only
the
coal.
they
may
have
surface
rights,
and
in
other
situations
they
may
have
an
interest
the
coal
as
well
as
own
the
surface
rights.
now,
if
i
understand
the
court's
cases
to
date,
ranging
from
penn
central
to
the
mahon
case,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
decide
that
a
sheer
or
mere
destruction
of
the
coal
is
not
a
taking
if
you
still
own
the
surface.
and
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
very
serious
policy
issue
insofar
as
making
that
decision
in
this
case
would
be
concerned.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
the
federal
government
is
doing
it.
but
in
this
case--
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
--it
could
be.
but
i...
the
government
doesn't
want
to
concede
that
they
have
the
remedy.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
well,
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
no,
that's
true.
but
i
think
there
is
an
irreparable
harm
beyond
that.
let
us
say
there
isn't
a
taking,
and
we
go
ahead
and
buy
this
land.
don't
we
have
irreparable
harm
because
we
bought
the
land,
put
the
investment
in,
and
if
an
80
percent
reduction
of
our
$12
million
isn't
enough
to
get
us
to
a
taking,
we
certainly
have
suffered
irreparable
harm.
and
the
tucker
act
isn't
going
to
help
us
because
there
wasn't
a
taking.
but
we've
been
irreparably
harmed
because
we've
put
our
money
in
and
we've
lost
80
percent
of
$12
million,
let
us
say.
isn't
that
irreparable
harm?
isn't
that
sufficient
for
a
court
to
go
ahead
and
make
a
declaratory
judgment
at
this
point
to
save
us,
the
industry,
if
you
will,
from
losing
80
percent
of
the
cost
of
what
we're
going
to
put
our
money
in?
aren't
we
entitled
to
know
if
it's
going
to
be
a
taking?
do
we
have
to
gamble?
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
my
only
answer
to
that
would
be,
your
honor,
if
nine
members
of
this
court
sometimes
don't
agree
on
what
is
a
taking,
how
can
our
clients
as
businessmen
really
have--
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
unconstitutional,
even
if
there's
no
taking,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
we're
entitled
to
the
remedy
of
a
declaratory
judgment
at
this
point
as
to
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't,
because
if
it's
not
a
taking
and
we
don't
have
the
right
to
get
our
money
back,
we
don't
want
to
put
our
money
into
prime
farmland,
under
prime
farmland,
when
we
can't
mine
the
coal.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
i
guess
that's...
i
guess
i
would
state
it
at
this
point
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
because
the
states
at
this
point
need
to
know
that.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
the
technological
capability,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
right.
that's
true.
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
insofar
as
the
property
is
concerned,
at
this
point,
our
clients
have
not
and
in
all
probability
that
is
due
to
the
grandfather
clause
that
is
present.
the
grandfather
clause
will
probably
come
to
an
end
insofar
as--
mr.
g.
daniel
kelly,
jr.
--that's
true,
and
there's
a
lot
of
litigation
over
the
extent
and
the
meaning
of
the
grandfather
clause,
so
that
there
is
some
type
of
preexisting
property
right
that
is
protected,
but
it's
coming
to
a
head
very
quickly.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
