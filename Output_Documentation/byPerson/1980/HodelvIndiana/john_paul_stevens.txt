mr.
buscemi,
could
you
help
me
on
your
argument
that
the
taking
issue
is
raised
prematurely
and
we'd
be
better
off
to
wait
till
a
specific
case
arose
involving
specific
parcel.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
thinking
of
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
issue
might
arise,
because
you
surely
couldn't
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act
till
the
property
had
been
taken.
i
don't
suppose
any
taking
would
occur
if
somebody
just
didn't
use
his
farm.
how
does
the...
at
what
point
would
a
taking
in
a
specific
future
case...
you
say
we
should
wait
for
a
future
case.
tell
me
how
you
think
it
could
arise
and
what
would
be
taken?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they're
not,
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
all
prospective
operators
would
be
in
the
same
boat.
they
all
have
to
restore
the
land
to
agricultural
condition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
only
variance
i
think
of
is
where
the
postmining
use
might
be,
say,
an
airport,
where
you
wouldn't
want
to
farm
on
it.
but
why
couldn't
he
just
build
the
airport
ahead
of
time?
then
we
get
back
to
the...
i
don't
see
the
hypothetical
case
of
the
taking,
frankly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
by
hypothesis
every
parcel
we're
talking
about
would
be
one
that
is
being
used
for
farming
immediately
before
the
mining
occurred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
direct,
though.
you
have
to
pay
the
penalty
before
you
get
the
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
precedent
for
that
particular
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
always
some
reason
for
an
immediate
seizure
of
the
property.
there's
no
particular
reason
for
making
the
defendant
pay
his
fine
in
advance,
is
there?
just
the
security,
that
you're
sure
you
get
the
money,
but
that's
not
exactly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
very
powerful
argument,
is
it?
i
mean,
you're
generally
dealing
with
solvent
people
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
fine
anybody,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
be
analogous
if
you
had
to
post
a
bond
before
you
could
file
your
answer.
in
other
words,
you've
got
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kelly,
let
me
push
you
with
a
question
on
it.
supposing
we
had
the
problem
of
nuclear
waste
disposal,
could
the
federal
government
regulate
the
kinds
of
land
in
which
the
nuclear
waste
may
be
deposited,
and
so
forth?
you
can't
dump
it
in
a
lake,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
congress
found
in
the
coal
area
that
there's
an
interstate
spillover?
the
facts
aren't
very
persuasive,
i
realize;
you've
done
a
very
good
job
on
that.
but
supposing
they
had
found
that
they
wanted
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
minimum
land
preserved
for
agricultural
uses?
and
that
would
have
an
interstate
spillover
because
the
agricultural
market
is
essentially
an
interstate
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
your
land
use
planning
exception,
or
land
use
control,
is
something
that
the
federal
government
can
invade
only
when
there
is
no
less
intrusive
means
of
doing
it?
it's
that
kind
of...
rather
than
an
absolute
line?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kelly,
would
you
help
me
a
little
more
on
the
taking
issue?
what
do
you
contend
constitutes
a
taking?
is
it
being
required
to
restore
the
land
to
its
original
use,
or
is
it
prohibiting
mining
in
cases
where
you
could
never
restore
it
to
original
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
apply
to
all
of
the
surface
mining,
or
just
the
certain
parcels
of
land,
or
how
widespread
is
this
defect
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
all
the
darkened
part
of
that
exhibit
prime
farmland?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
balance
of
the
state
that's
not
shaded
at
all,
is
there
no
coal
there?
there's
coal
in
other
parts
of
the?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
coal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
if
you
presume
the
statute
is
constitutional,
you
shouldn't
buy
the
land
unless
you
think
you
can
make
some
money
mining
it,
bearing
the
cost
of
restoring
it
to
its
original
condition.
you
can
make
that
decision
before
you
spend
the
$12
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
complaining
if,
even
if
there's
no
taking,
you
say
it
should
be
unconstitutional,
which
is
a
little
different
argument
than
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
supposing
that
with
respect
to
90
percent
of
the
mineable
land
in
indiana,
it
can
be
restored
and
maybe
five
or
ten
percent
cannot
be.
is
that
a
reason
for
holding
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional,
or
for
giving
a
remedy
in
the
five
or
ten
percent
of
the
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
concede
that
if
there
are,
say,
in
95
percent
of
the
cases
the
statute
works
fine,
but
five
percent
of
the
cases
they
can
prove
they
couldn't
restore
the
land
to
the
original
condition.
do
you
concede
that
that
would
establish
a
taking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
so
you'd
say,
they
don't
have
a
remedy
either?
