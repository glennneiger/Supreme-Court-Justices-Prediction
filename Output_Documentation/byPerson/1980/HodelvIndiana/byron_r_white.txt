justice
white
and
to
keep
it
that
way
for
five
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
have
to...
before
you
mine,
you
want
to
get,
you
have
to
have
a
permit
to
open
up
a
bond.
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
you
have
the
capability
of
restoring--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
suppose
that
you
go
in
and
you
say,
i
want
a
permit
to
mine,
but
i'll
demonstrate
to
you
that
i
have
no...
that
this,
i
just
can't
do
it,
and
if
the
government
denies
you
a
permit,
what
it's
saying
to
you
is
that
you
cannot
mine
your
coal.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
at
that
point
you've
been
deprived
of
your
mineral
interest,
you
would
say,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
done
this
with
any
particular
piece
of
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
doing
the
mining...
so
far
you've
been
able
to
mine
under
the
grandfather
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
he
does
his
best
to
prove
to
the
government
and
the
government
says,
you've
failed
to
prove
it,
no
permit.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
then
they
can
mine
the
coal?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
they
win
on
the
merits,
if
they
could
prove
that
in
five
percent
of
the
cases
it
would
just
be
impossible
to
restore
this
land.
and
the
court
just
says,
well,
we
agree
with
you,
but
mr.
buscemi
here
says
that
wouldn't
be
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
can
go
on
being
used
as
farmland.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
makes
their
mineral
interest
unusable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
then,
you
would
say
that
if
the
federal
government
had
just
passed
a
law
that
said,
there
will
be
no
more
strip
mining
in
indiana...
well,
there
will
be
no
more
strip
mining
under
any
prime
farmlands
no
matter
what,
with
just
a
flat
prohibition,
the
land
remains
quite
usable
as
prime
farmland.
you
would
just
say
that's
not
a
taking?
justice
white
and
avoid
an
injunction
issue
if
there
were
an
adequate
remedy
at
law?
justice
white
well,
compensation
would
be
adequate,
wouldn't
it?
