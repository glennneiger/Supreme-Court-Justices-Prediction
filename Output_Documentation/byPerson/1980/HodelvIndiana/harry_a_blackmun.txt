well,
in
past
years
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
surface
mining
in
the
state
of
illinois.
justice
blackmun
well,
of
course,
statistically
that
doesn't
mean
anything.
they
may
have
a
lot
more
coal
than
indiana
has.
justice
blackmun
and
i
say
those
statistics
don't
really
mean
very
much
unless
they're
taken
in
the
context
of
the
total
production
in
each
state.
go
ahead.
