we
will
proceed
to
hear
arguments
in
the
related
case
of
the
secretary
v.
indiana.
mr.
buscemi,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
issue
could
be
raised
at
a
later
point
by
another
litigant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
haven't
read
mr.
conlon's
letter
in
full,
but
when
he
states
that
the
coal
industry
is
quite
capable,
do
you
mean,
is
he
saying
it's
physically
possible
or
economically
feasible
or
both?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
have
that
before
me.
some
parts
of
it
have
an
ambiguity
in
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
the
specific
illustration
he's
giving,
it
apparently...
he
regards
it
as
economically
feasible.
but
i
wondered...
you
seem
to
be
relying
on
that
as
a
general
proposition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kelly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
