justice
white
well,
when
did
the
change
of
circumstance
take
place
in
these
proceedings?
justice
white
yes,
when
did
they
separate?
justice
white
well,
was
it
before
or
after
the
case
went
through
the
delaware
courts?
justice
white
did
the
delaware
supreme
court
know
these
facts?
justice
white
well,
do
you
suppose
the
same
thing
would
have
happened...
do
you
think
the
same
termination
of
parental
rights
would
have
occurred
if
the
facts
that
now
exist
had
existed
at
the
time
of
the
petition
to
terminate
parental
rights?
justice
white
yes.
and
the
marriage
of
the
mother?
justice
white
it
was
never
given
to
the
trial
court,
though?
justice
white
did
you
ask
them
to?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
that's
why
i'm
asking
you,
you
never--
justice
white
--well,
i
would
have
supposed
you
might
have
had
an
easier
time
in
the
trial
court
on
these
facts,
wouldn't
you?
just
on
parental
termination,
because
you're
not
asking,
you're
not
objecting
right
now
to
the
change
of
custody.
justice
white
no.
justice
white
you're
interested
in
having
the
termination
of
parental
rights
overturned?
justice
white
but
you've
never
asked
anybody...
this
judgment
isn't
final
yet,
is
it?
justice
white
no,
it
isn't--
justice
white
--if
isn't
final.
justice
white
but
you've
never
asked
a
delaware
court
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
new
facts,
have
you?
justice
white
so
you
don't
really...
you
don't
really
say
that
the
welfare
of
the
children
is
necessarily
an
insufficient
standard.
if
a
state
happened
to
construe
that
standard
as
requiring
some
showing
of
injury
to
the
children,
you
wouldn't
have
any
objection
to
it.
justice
white
no,
i'm
not
saying
legislature.
i
said
the
state
court
construed
it
that
way.
justice
white
or
in
any
specific
case,
if
in
applying
the
welfare
of
the
children
standard
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
found
that
there
was
harm
to
the
children?
i
don't
know
how
you'd--
justice
white
--you
wouldn't
require
the
same
standard
for
termination
of
custody,
would
you?
justice
white
it
is
in
a
sense
because
i
take
it
that
you
would
say,
if
the
state
had
custody
of
the
children,
and
validly
so,
that
there
could
never
be
an
adoption,
unless
your
standard
is
satisfied?
justice
white
so
unless
the
state
could
prove
that,
the
state
would
always
just
have
to
retain
custody?
justice
white
and
you
would
be
required
not
to
put
these
children
in
any
kind
of
a
permanent
family?
justice
white
so
are
you
saying
custody
then
rests
on
the
same
standard
or
not?
justice
white
well,
mrs
small,
has
there
ever
been
a
request
to
reconsider
this
case
in
light
of
the
current
facts?
justice
white
do
you
think
this
represents
a
judgment
by
the
delaware
supreme
court
that
these
changed
circumstances
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
the?
justice
white
yes,
but
some
of
the
problems
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
proceeding
in
the
trial
court
didn't
exist
anymore,
did
they?
they
weren't
living
together
incestuously,
the
lady
was
married.
now--
justice
white
--so
you
really
can't
say
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
has
acted
on
a
request
to
remand
for
further
proceedings
in
light
of
the
changed
circumstances?
justice
white
in
delaware,
does
this
same
statute
govern
removing
children
from
the
custody
of
the
parents?
justice
white
well,
what
if
this
case
were
pending
now
in
the
delaware
supreme
court?
suppose
it
had
just
been
filed.
suppose
it
was
filed
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
the
day
after
the
new
statute
was
passed.
under
what
law
would
the
delaware
court
review
the
case?
justice
white
yes?
justice
white
it
wouldn't
review
it
in
the
light
of
the
new
statute?
justice
white
that's
a
little
odd,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
it
could
remand
to
see
if
the
trial
court...
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
new
statute.
wouldn't
that
be
the
thing
to
do?
justice
white
but
our
rule
here
normally
is
in
civil
cases
to
adjudge
a
case
in
the
light
of
the
current
law,
the
current
statute.
why
shouldn't
we
remand
for
reconsideration
to
see
if
the
new
statute
makes
any
difference
to
the
delaware
courts?
justice
white
well,
i'm
really
wanting
a
legal
answer.
justice
white
which
will
probably
be
the
same
thing,
so
go
ahead.
justice
white
why
is
that?
delaware
has
replaced
its
statute.
justice
white
well,
but
it's
nevertheless
replaced
the
statute.
it
isn't
the
same
standard,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
then,
why
shouldn't...
in
a
case
that's
not
final,
why
shouldn't
these
parents
now
have
their
case
judged
in
the
light
of
the
current
state
standards?
and
why
should
we
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
that's
been
replaced?
