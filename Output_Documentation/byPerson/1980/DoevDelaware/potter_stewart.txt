justice
stewart
well,
if
the
delaware
legislature
should
say
that
a
mother
and
father
who
were
living
in
an
incestuous
relationship
are
unfitted
as
parents
and
that
that
alone
is
ground
for
termination
of
the
parental
rights,
that
would
certainly
eliminate
the
vagueness
problem.
justice
stewart
but
as
i
understand
your
answers
to
questions
propounded
to
you
by
my
colleagues,
that
would
not
eliminate
either
of
the
other
two
problems
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
and
is
my
understanding
correct?
justice
stewart
but
the
court
has.
the
court
has
construed
this
statute
to
mean
that.
justice
stewart
right.
correct.
justice
stewart
so,
in
other
words,
it
would
not
eliminate
your
other
two
challenges
to
the
legislation?
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
is
my
understanding
correct?
that's
my
only
question.
justice
stewart
well,
not
your
personal
belief.
your
belief
as
an
advocate
here,
before
this
court.
justice
stewart
it
would
not.
it
would
eliminate
the
vagueness
problem,
clearly.
justice
stewart
right.
