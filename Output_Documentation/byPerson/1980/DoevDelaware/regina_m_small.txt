ms.
regina
m.
small
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
abstruse
academic
and
abstract
principles
of
constitutional
law
but
as
the
justice'
questions
have
demonstrated,
cases
that
come
to
this
court
are
neither
abstruse,
abstract,
or
academic.
this
case
involves
five
children
and
their
biologic
parents,
and
the
right
of
those
parents
now
separated,
and
the
mother
remarried
and
raising
the
child
of
her
present
husband,
to
regain
parental
rights...
if
this
order
is
final
except
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
finally
final
because
it's
before
the
court...
to
regain
the
right
to
some
form
of
contact
with
these
children
and
perhaps
some
custody
at
some
future
time
after
planning,
according
to
counsel.
ms.
roe
testified
at
the
tpr
hearing
that
what
she
wanted
was
to
keep
a
good
home
for
them,
the
children,
to
keep
them
clothed
and
fed
good.
that
was
her
concept
of
parenting
duties.
the
testimony
in
the
record...
and
there
is
the
transcript
of
a
five
day
trial
on
remand
to
the
delaware
superior
court
which
conducted
the
termination
hearing,
the
record
before
that
court
indicates
that
in
visitation
and
the
time
between
the
removal
on
custody
grounds
of
these
children
and
the
termination
hearing,
ms.
roe
was
not
particularly
interested
in
the
children,
unable
to
relate
to
them.
the
social
worker
who
participated
in
the
visitations
testified
at
one
point
that
the
young
child,
a
baby
at
that
time,
charles,
was
brought
in,
cried.
the
mother
was
unable
to
comfort
him,
unable
to
bring
any
emotional
succor
to
him,
and
the
foster
mother
who
was
in
the
building
at
the
time
of
this
visitation
had
to
be
brought
in
to
calm
the
child
down
so
that
the
visitation
could
continue
for
but
a
short
time.
the
mother
made
no
emotional
responses
when
the
children
left,
no--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--my
recollection
is
that
he
was
an
infant,
justice
stevens.
he
would
have
been--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--but
the
foster
mother
was
able
to
calm
him
very
quickly.
ms.
regina
m.
small
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
does,
and
more
often
than
once,
but
this
is
the
reaction
that
happened
in
a
specific
visitation
session.
and
the
testimony
was
that
beyond
this
particular
visitation
session...
in
fact,
when
the
children
were
in
voluntary
custody
of
the
division,
the
eldest
two,
amy
and
bill,
ms.
roe
indicated
no
particular
interest
in
where
the
children
were
or
how--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--that's
a
question
i
ask
myself
without
a
good
answer,
justice
stevens.
the
children
in
this
case
have
not
seen
their
parents
since--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--they
made
some
efforts
through
the
division
and
through
counsel
to--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--and
they
were
denied.
they
also--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--they
made
an
attempt
in
1977,
december
of
1977,
more
than
a
year
and
four
months
after
the
first
termination
hearing,
to
obtain
a
stay
of
the
termination
hearing
for
the
purposes
of
obtaining
visitation
rights.
that
application
was
made
to
the
trial
court
as
delaware
procedure
requires.
it
was
denied,
the
application
was
not
renewed
in
the
delaware
supreme
court.
and
so
a
full
year
and
eight
months
after
the
last
of
the
children
were
removed
from
their
custody,
much
less
their
parental
control,
was
the
first
time
they
made
an
application
to
the
court
to
stay
the
order
so
that
they
could--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--yes,
they
had,
and
they
continued--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--that's
correct.
ms.
regina
m.
small
and
they
had
the
opportunity
to
make
the
application
to
the
delaware
supreme
court
and
did
not
do
so.
ms.
regina
m.
small
no,
justice
stevens,
there
has
not
been
and
in
fact,
at
the
time
of
oral
argument
before
the
delaware
supreme
court,
as
the
full
opinion
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
discloses,
the
delaware
supreme
court
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
mr.
doe
was
living
in
georgia.
ms.
regina
m.
small
i
think
it
undoubtedly
does
because
not
only
was
mr.
doe's
parental
rights
terminated
but
ms.
roe's
parental
rights
were
terminated
also.
and
there
was
evidence
with
respect
to
each
of
the
parents
put
forward
in
the
termination
trial.
and
on
the
basis
that--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--that's
correct.
however,
no
application
was
made
to
the
delaware
supreme
court,
although
it
was
upon
question--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--undoubtedly
they
have
not
acted
because
they
have
not
been
requested
to
act,
although
it
was
a
question
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
which
elicited
the
information
on
the
present
condition,
then
present
condition,
1978,
of
the
parents
of
these
children.
so
that
fact
was
clearly
before
them,
that
ms.
roe
was
married
to
another
man
and
raising
his
child--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--no,
it
does
not,
justice
white.
the
first
point
i
should
make
is
that
this
statute
is
now
repealed
and
we're
only
talking
about
nine
children
who
would
be
affected
by
the
decision
of
this
court,
the
five
children
here
and
the
four
children
in
able
v.
delaware
case
where
the
appeal
has
not--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--if
the
appeal
were
pending
on...
if
the
appeals
were
filed
the
day
after
the
new
statute
was
enacted,
as
i
understand
your
question--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--the
delaware
supreme
court
would
review
the
case
under
the
statute
existing
at
the
time
of
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
ms.
regina
m.
small
with
the--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--with
the
attack
made
on
appeal,
i
can't
see
how
the
court
could
review
it
in
light
of
the
new
statute
except
to
say--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--you
anticipated
my
exception:
except
to
say
that
it
could
take
cognizance
of
the
record
and
make
a
determination
on
its
own
from
the
record,
or
more
likely,
to
remand
to
the
trial
court.
but
at
the
time
of
the
termination
the
now
repealed
statute
was
the
one
that
governed.
ms.
regina
m.
small
i
can
only
give
a
practical
answer
to
that
question,
justice
white.
that
is--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--then
i
shall
attempt
to
give
a
legal
answer.
ms.
regina
m.
small
a
remand
of
this
case
for
application
of
the
present
delaware
statute
by
the
delaware
courts
would
be
no
more
and
no
less
than
a
tacit
recognition
that
the
former
statute
was
vague
and
likely--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--as
part
of
a
more
comprehensive
statutory--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--no,
it's...
the
language
of
the
statute
is
different,
although
in
the
generic
terms
both
unfitness
and
best
interests
are
still
required.
in
fact,
the
new
statute
is
remarkably
similar
in
its
language
to
the
statutes
to
which
the
appellants
point
the
court
in
the
appendices
to
their
brief
as
being
models
of
the
kind
of
flexibility
that
is
required.
ms.
regina
m.
small
that
leads
me
only
to
my
practical
answer
that
it
will
be
several
more
years
before
there
can
be
permanent
placement
for
these
children.
the
state
thinks
that
that
would
be
travesty.
delaware's
termination
of
parental
rights
statute,
the
tpr
statute,
is
not,
as
counsel
suggests,
unique.
we
know
of
no
state
which
doesn't
have
a
similar
statutory
provision.
in
fact,
in
appellants'
brief
at
page
32,
notes
52
and
53,
in
making
their
standard
of
proof
argument,
the
appellants
list
a
number
of
states
that
use
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
of
proof
in
termination
of
parental
rights
standards,
parental
rights
acts.
so
i
would
assume
that
they
will
concede
that
there
are
other
tpr
statutes.
in
fact,
delaware
was
in
the
forefront
of
having
statutes
which
require
both
the
best
interest
and
the
fitness
of
the
parents
to
be
considered
with
the
cline
case
in
1967,
the
very
standards
which
this
court
has
alluded
to
in
both
offer
and
in
kilwarren.
counsel
in
his
brief
recitation
of
the
facts
seems
to
pass
over
the
years
intervening
between
the
first
contact
between
doe
and
roe
and
the
division
of
social
services,
and
the
time
at
which
the
termination
of
parental
rights
action
was
filed.
in
those
three
years
there
was
continued
contact
between
the
agency
and
the
family.
the
children
were
first
placed
voluntarily,
because
mr.
doe
came
to
the
agency
and
said
that
he
was
not
able
at
that
time
to
provide
support
for
his
family.
after
helping
him
obtain
employment
and
helping
the
family
find
a
nice
home,
the
younger
of
the
two
children
at
that
time,
bill,
was
replaced
in
the
home.
the
division
observed
the
family
life,
was
satisfied
that
at
that
point
in
1973
the
family
was
coping,
providing
stability
for
the
one
child
replaced,
the
elder
child,
amy,
shortly
thereafter.
the
reaction
to
that
was
that
mr.
doe
quit
his
job
very
promptly;
he
went
out
and
found
another,
was
fired.
the
family
moved
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
the
night
before
a
worker
was
to
make
a
regular
visit,
leaving
no
forwarding
address.
from
that
time
on
the
relationships
between
the
division
and
the
family
continued
to
increase.
the
division's
policy
is
to
maintain
the
family
unit
whenever
possible,
and
when
it
becomes
impossible
by
reason
of
incapability
or
failure
of
the
parents
to
be
able
to
provide
the
nurturing
stable
environment
that
the
child
has
a
right
to,
and
family
integrity,
then
the
division
believes
that
a
permanent
placement
alternative
as
close
to
the
family
situation
that
is
a
new
adoptive
family
is
the
preferable
one.
and
in
fact
the
record
discloses
that
it
was
not
until
the
division
made
the
determination
that
these
children
should
be
put
in
adoptive
care
where
they
could
be
received
into
a
new
family,
albeit
not
a
biologic
one,
but
a
new
family,
that
the
tpr
was
filed.
ms.
regina
m.
small
the
record
does
not
disclose
that.
they
are
in
four
families.
the
twins
are
in
the
same
placement,
the
youngsters.
ms.
regina
m.
small
the
record
does
not
disclose
that,
justice
marshall.
a
reference
to
miss
kinkaid's
testimony
at
the
trial,
termination
trial,
is
where
that
information
comes
from.
miss
kinkaid,
who
was
a
psychologist
employed
by
the
division
to
test
and
observe
these
children,
testified...
and
her
testimony
can
be
found
at
page
241
of
the
record...
that
she
thought
from
some
information
she
saw
that
was
provided
by
either
the
division
or
children's
bureau,
that
amy
had
been
in
nine
placements.
on
our
cross
examination
she
was
asked,
"nine
placements,
foster
placements"?
and
she
said,
"no,
i
think
it's
nine.
"
"well.
"
--and
i'm
paraphrasing...
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
check
i'm
not
sure.
the
next
piece
of
evidence
that
was
put
before
her
was
the
records
of
the
state
hospital,
the
child
psychiatric
center
where
amy
was
tested
several
years
before.
and
at
that
point
there
was
a
showing
that
she
had
been
in
three
foster
placements.
her
placement
worker
testified--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--yes.
and--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--yes,
the
agency--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--there
was
no
affirmative
showing
to
contradict
that
rather
questionable
recollection
on
miss
kinkaid's
part.
ms.
regina
m.
small
it
could
have
been
done.
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
the
child
has
been
in
a
total
of
six
placements,
including
with
her
own
family,
in
her
entire
life
till
today.
but
that's
not
on
the
record.
the
evidence,
though,
that
is
on
the
record
that
is
alluded
to
to
support
nine
placements
does
not
support
nine
placements.
ms.
regina
m.
small
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
regina
m.
small
neither
do
i,
justice
marshall.
ms.
regina
m.
small
i
think
you
can
draw
no
conclusion
from
that,
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
back
to
the
time
of
the
termination
proceeding
and
ms.
roe's
interest
in
regaining
custody
of
her
children
i
think
is
belied
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
for
example,
when
the
sexual
misconduct
charge
was
filed
against
mr.
doe,
custody
of
their
then
three
children
was
in
the
state,
actual
physical
custody,
as
well
as
legal
custody;
and
then
when
roe
disappeared
for
a
period
of
four
months
after
the
charge
was
filed,
leaving
the
state,
making
no
attempts
to
have
any
contact
with
her
children
at
that
point.
the
record
does
disclose
history
of
instability
in
the
family
that
relates
both
to
mr.
doe
and
ms.
roe,
and
a
lack
on
her
part
of
any
strong
emotional
attachment
to
any
of
the
children.
the
youngest
have
been
out
of
the
home
since
under
the
age
of
six
months.
ms.
regina
m.
small
the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
i
can
point
to
as
her
positive
assertions
are
the
testimony
which
i
quoted--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--she
now
seeks,
as
i
understand
it
from
her
affidavit
in
forma
pauperis
contact,
i
understand
from
counsel's
argument
this
morning,
that
they
would
seek
to
reunite
the
family.
i
understand
from
a
quotation
in
the
local
newspaper
yesterday
that
he
didn't
know
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
the
children.
this
is
a
perplexing
point
for
the
division
as
well
as
it
clearly
is
for
the
court.
ms.
regina
m.
small
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
she
has
abandoned
the
children,
which
is
a
separate
basis
for
termination.
her
parental
rights
were
terminated
on
the
basis
of
her
individual
unfitness
without
regard
to
mr.
doe,
except
that
one
of
the
reasons
was
they
lived
in
an
incestuous
relationship.
ms.
regina
m.
small
i
have
only
counsel's
representation
to
rely
upon
and--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--the
record's
been
closed
in
this
case
since
december,
1976,
justice
marshall.
ms.
regina
m.
small
that's
correct.
ms.
regina
m.
small
no,
and
that's
what
counsel
admitted
in
his
opening
statement,
that--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--he
did
say
that,
your
honor.
ms.
regina
m.
small
no,
your
honor,
we
have
not
conducted
discovery
in
this
case
while
it
was
before
the
court,
didn't
think
it
appropriate.
ms.
regina
m.
small
there
is,
we
believe,
before
the
court
one
properly
raised
constitutional
issue
and
that's
the
attack
on
the
former
delaware
statute
for
vagueness.
the
standard
and
the
rationale
for
a
vagueness
standard
is
that
the
state
in
enacting
legislation
which
affects
individuals
should
put
the
reasonable
man
on
notice
as
to
what
conduct
is
prohibited
so
that
he
may
act
accordingly
and
so
that
in
applying
such
standards
the
courts
may
determine
without
a
discriminatory
or
standardless
application
whether
the
statute
is
in
force.
we
think
that
the
former
delaware
statute
survives
an
attack
as
void
for
vague.
it
is
not
a
question
of
what's
preferable
draftsmanship.
the
question
is
whether
it
meets
the
threshold
requirements,
either
on
its
face
or
assuming,
not
on
its
face,
through
narrowing
interpretations
of
the
delaware
courts.
the
statute
says
that
parental
rights
may
be
terminated
when
one
is
considered
not
fitted
to
exercise
parental
duties.
that
seems
to
me
to
be...
and
to
the
delaware
courts...
to
be
a
standard
that
is
comprehensible
by
the
ordinary
person:
care,
feeding,
clothing,
providing
for
the
emotional
needs,
and
the
need
to
stay
in
out
of
the
rain,
plaintiffs
submit
that
there
are
no
slide
rule
calculations
for
determining
what's
a
statute
which
would
survive
the
void
for
vagueness
attack,
and
as
the
amici
agree,
there
should
be
in
the
case
of
child
custody
some
flexibility
for
determining
the
statutes.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
referring
to
the
dictionary
definition
has
suggested
that
the
statute
is
on
its
face
sufficient
to
give
standards.
even
if
it's
not
the
delaware
courts
have
over
the
years
interpreted
the
statute
so
that
any
reasonable
person
ought
to
know
what
conduct
is
proscribed.

the
question--

--as
to
the

justice
stewart,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
until--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--until
motion
for
reargument.
as
to
the
former,
the
argument
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
was
that
the
standard
of
proof
was
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
appellants
correctly
point
out
in
their
reply
brief
that
they
make
reference
to
the
addington
case
in
their
reply
brief
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
and
in
their
motion
for
reargument.
but
they
do
not
discuss
the
context
in
which
that
reference
was
made.
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof
issue,
addington
is
cited
in
their
reply
brief
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
directly
after
the
positive
statement
that
the
standard
of
proof
in
this
case
must
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
regina
m.
small
the
case
was
cited.
ms.
regina
m.
small
that
is
correct.
the
standard
which
was
urged
was
not
the
standard
which
is
now
urged
in
this
court.
ms.
regina
m.
small
well,
my
answer
suggests
two
things,
justice
brennan.
first,
the
change
in
the
statute
enacted
this
summer
does
not
add
the
best
interests
standard.
that
has
been
a
standard
by
statute
or
by
court
decisions
since
before
1967.
the
change
was
in
the
phraseology
respecting
fitted
or
not
fitted.
to
answer,
i
think,
the
thrust
of
your
real
question
now,
i
can
only
suggest
that
the
new
statute
is
presently
under
constitutional
attack
for
the
same
reasons
in
the
delaware
state
courts
and
it's
likely
that--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--in
light
of
the
new
statute?
ms.
regina
m.
small
no,
we
do
not
know,
although--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--well,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
even
the
appellants
would
agree
that
the
new
statute,
although
they
won't
concede
it's
constitutionally
acceptable,
is
better
than
the
old
statute
and
that
the
delaware
supreme
court
did
not
find
the
old
statute
vague,
and
for
a
determination
of
parental
rights
under
that
statute
they
would
likely
affirm
that
as
precedent.
ms.
regina
m.
small
that's
correct.
because
in
delaware
termination
of
parental
rights
is
a
prerequisite
for
the
adoption--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--in
some
states--
ms.
regina
m.
small
--that's
correct.
ms.
regina
m.
small
certainly,
justice
white.
