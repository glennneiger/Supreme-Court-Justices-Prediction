justice
stevens
mr.
myers,
do
you
agree
or
what
is
your
view
on
whether
the
issues
are
the
same
for
the
mother
and
the
father?
now,
the
reason
i
ask
that,
there's
the
evidence
of
the
offensive
touching
as
to
the
father
and
the
alcoholism...
at
least
at
some
time
in
the
past...
as
to
the
father,
and
one
thing
and
another.
but
now
the
parents
are
in
different
places
and
presumably
it
would
make
a
difference
as
to
which
parent
had
the
contact
with
the
child.
do
you
concede
that
if
the
order
is
proper
as
to
one
parent,
it's
proper
as
to
both?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
is
it
the
same
issue
as
to
both?
justice
stevens
i
understand
on
your
harm
argument,
but
on
the
best
interests
of
the
child
argument,
perhaps
now
that
they're
separated
there's
at
least
an
arguable
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
stevens
in
fact,
are
their
interests
entirely
parallel?
are
they
the
same?
i
know
you
represent
them
both,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
one
were
representing
the
mother
separately
perhaps
the
mother
could
make
some
arguments
the
father
can't
make.
justice
stevens
how
old
was
the
child
then?
justice
stevens
there
are
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
a
child
may
continue
to
cry.
justice
stevens
mrs.
small,
why
do
you
suppose
they're
still
litigating
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
they
did
make
efforts
to
and
they
were
denied
access
to
the
children?
justice
stevens
and
they
were
denied.
justice
stevens
well,
what
were
they
supposed
to
do
after
that?
other
than
fight
this
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
had
they
made
informal
requests
to
the
agency?
justice
stevens
made
and
denied.
had
they
regularly
been
denied?
justice
stevens
maybe
they
got
a
little
discouraged.
and
then
they
tried
in
court,
and
they
were
denied
in
court.
justice
stevens
ms.
small,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
all
the
children
are
in
the
same
family.
are
they
perhaps
in
five
separate
families?
