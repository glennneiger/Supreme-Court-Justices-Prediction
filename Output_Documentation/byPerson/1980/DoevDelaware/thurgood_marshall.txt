justice
marshall
physical
or
mental
harm?
justice
marshall
i
just
wanted
to
know,
do
i
have
to
get
degree
in
psychiatry
to
decide
the
case?
justice
marshall
the
problem
i
have
is
that
you
admit
that
they're
living
in
incest;
they
were.
justice
marshall
and
you
don't
think
that
a
child
brought
up
in
the
home
of
two
criminals
continuing
to
practice
their
criminality
is
not
a
good
home?
justice
marshall
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
what
you
think
about
it.
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
well,
suppose
a
state
has
murder
as
a
misdemeanor,
would
a
home
of
husband,
mother
and
father
convicted
murderers,
making
murder
their
pastime,
be
a
decent
home,
in
your
opinion?
justice
marshall
so
it's
perfectly
all
right
to
live
in
the
home
of
murderers?
what's
your
position?
justice
marshall
the
record
does
show
that
one
was
in
nine
families
in
one
year.
justice
marshall
but
didn't
you
have
a
record
of
your
own
where
the
child
was?
justice
marshall
didn't
the
agency
have
a
record?
justice
marshall
well,
didn't
the
agency
put
the
record
in
to
contradict
that?
justice
marshall
but
you
could
have
done
it,
couldn't
you?
justice
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
present
husband
will
take
the
five
children?
