mr.
gary
a.
myers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
by
two
parents,
john
doe
and
jane
roe,
from
a
final
decision
of
the
delaware
supreme
court.
by
this
appeal
they
seek
to
overturn
lower
court
orders
which
permanently
and
irrevocably
terminated
all
of
their
relationships
with
their
five
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
parents...
if
this
order
was
vacated
at
this
time,
custody
would
still
remain
within
the
state.
hopefully
we
could
meet
with
representatives
of
the
state,
establish
visitation
with
these
children,
with
the
eventual
goal
of
the
mother
regaining
them
in
her
custody.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
mother
regaining
them
in
her
custody.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
he
is
more
than
willing
to
allow
the
mother
to
have
custody
and
allow
him
to
have
reasonable
visitation
rights
so
he
can
maintain
his
fatherly
role
with
the
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
state
has
resisted
efforts
for
the--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--since
1975.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
father
lives
and
works
in
atlanta
and
the
mother
lives
with
her
stepson
and
her
husband,
and
remains
in
delaware.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
yes.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
no,
i
think
they
want
to
regain
their
children
back
into
their
own
family,
into
their
own
family.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
mother
wants
to--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--well,
i
think
the
mother
had
a
family
relationship
with
her
children
before
the
state
intervened
in
this
family
and
she
is
more
than
willing
to
again
create
those
day
to
day
attachments.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
they
range
in
ages
from
six
through
nine.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
yes.
there
is
a...
their
ages
are...
the
oldest
one
is
nine,
and
the
two
youngest
ones
who
are
twins
are
six
now.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
below
was
a
termination
of
parental
rights
proceeding,
or
a
tpr.
that
proceeding
is
unique
in
delaware.
it
seeks
not
only
just
to
remove
children
from
the
custody
of
their
parents;
rather
it
seeks
to
forever
break
the
parent
child
relationship.
it
is
not
a
temporary
removal
of
a
child.
in
the
words
of
the
delaware
statute,
its
sole
purpose
is
"to
make
parents
and
the
children
as
if
they
were
and
have
always
been
strangers.
"
it's
in
effect
a
death
penalty
for
the
family.
this
appeal
raises
three
questions
against
the
tpr
outlined
above.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
a
tpr
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
an
adoption.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
as
to
the
parent,
it
makes
him
a
stranger.
it
doesn't
necessarily
guarantee
to
the
child
that
there's
going
to
be
a
replacement.
as
i
said,
this
appeal
raises
three
questions
against
the
termination
order
below.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
statutory
standards
used
to
break
up
this
family
were
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
second
standard
is
whether
the
state
could
proceed
to
break
up
this
family
in
a
judicial
proceeding
using
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
the
third
standard
is
whether
the
state
could
break
up
this
family
without
demonstrating
that
any
of
the
conduct
alleged
against
these
parents
had
caused
any
actual,
substantial
harm
to
the
children.
briefly
stated,
the
facts
of
the
case
were
these.
john
doe
and
jane
roe
were
half
brother
and
sister,
and
beginning
in
the
1970s
they
lived
together
and
had
five
children.
the
delaware
state
welfare
agency,
the
division
of
social
services,
knew
about
mr.
and
mrs.
doe's
relationship
since
1972,
and
had
previously
indicated
to
them
that
that
relationship
would
not
be
a
factor
that
the
division
would
consider
about
them
raising
their
children.
however,
in
early
1975
workers
from
the
division
went
to
the
local
attorney
general,
the
attorney
that
advised
them.
he
told
them
at
that
meeting
that
so
long
as
there
were
children
in
the
doe
home,
they
would
not
be
able
to
prove
the
does
were
unfit
parents
and
would
not
be
able
to
get
a
termination
of
parental
rights.
at
that
meeting,
then,
it
was
decided
that
in
order
to
remove
the
children
from
the
home
the
parents
would
be
charged
with
the
criminal
charge
of
incest.
once
they
were
charged
with
that,
the
division
would
then
proceed
to
obtain
custody
of
the
children
and
then
file
a
termination
of
parental
rights
as
to
all
of
their
children.
that
plan
of
action
by
the
division
was
followed
through.
within
a
week
after
the
meeting
the
attorney
general
brought
a
criminal
charge
of
incest
against
the
parents.
the
parents
were
incarcerated
in
default
of
a
$1,000
bond
for
19
days.
given
their
absence,
the
division
of
social
service
was
in
effect
given
temporary
custody
of
the
children.
subsequently,
the
parents
were
convicted
of
the
criminal
charge
of
incest,
a
misdemeanor
in
delaware,
and
permanent
custody
of
the
children
was
given
to
the
division.
what's
important
to
note
about
the
incest
conviction
is
that,
as
the
parents
testified,
after
the
conviction
of
the
misdemeanor
they
were
told
by
the
presiding
judge
that
presided
at
that
trial
that
if
they
underwent
sterilization
that
would
be
a
substantial
factor
in
them
regaining
their
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
yes,
they
did.
anxious
to
get
their
children
back,
and
relying
on
that
advice,
they
underwent
sterilization.
within
a
week
after
undergoing
that
sterilization
the
division
told
them
that
they
were
going
to
terminate
all
their
parental
rights.
the
division--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--yes,
he
did.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
don't
believe
so.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that,
but
to
my
knowledge
he
wasn't.
the
division
then
filed
the
termination
of
parental
rights
proceeding.
the
statute
under
which
they
based
that
provision
was
a
former
delaware
provision
which
allowed
the
termination
if
the
parents
were
not
fitted
to
continue
to
exercise
parental
rights.
that
short
phrase
was
the
sum
extent
of
the
statutory
definition
of
when
a
termination
could
go
forward.
in
its
original
petition
the
division
alleged
that
the
not
fitted
conduct
sufficient
to
trigger
the
statute
was
their
half
brother
and
half
sister
relationship.
it's
this
conduct
that
the
division
had
known
about
for
almost
three
years
and
had
in
fact
told
them
in
the
past
that
it
wasn't
going
to
be
used
against
them.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
we
contend
also
that
"best
interest"
is
just
as
vague
as
"not
fitted"
language.
the
triggering
criteria
to
get
to
"best
interest"
is
in
effect
the
"not
fitted"
standard.
unless
you
can
go
forward
on
"not
fitted",
i
don't
think
that
"best
interest"
as
a
matter
of
state
law
comes
into
play.
and
both
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court
emphatically
stated
that
the
half
brother...
half
sister
relationship
was
the
disqualifying,
triggering
criterion
of
"not
fitted".
mr.
gary
a.
myers
it's
a
precondition.
if
in
effect
the
precondition
has
been
met,
then
it
would
have
to
go
into
"best
interest".
i
think
this
opinion
points
out
exactly
the
limited
scope
the
delaware
supreme
court
has
read
into
the
term
"best
interest".
i
think
that
the
phrase
itself
is
a
comparative
phrase
and
it
requires
looking
at
all
the
elements
concerning
the
child.
how
the
trial
court
and...
both...
the
supreme
court
construed
it
was
that
they
were
again
merely
looking
not
to
any
harm
to
the
children
that
had
occurred
but
rather
to
some
sort
of
conduct
of
the
parents
in
the
abstract.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
don't
think
the
order
is
proper
as
to
either
parent.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
yes,
i
think...
again,
there's
no
conduct
on
behalf
of
either
parent,
particularly
the
mother,
but
even
to
the
father's
conduct,
there's
no
conduct
on
his
part
which
was
shown
that
any
of
that
conduct
caused
harm
to
his
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
i
think
the
best
interests--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--well,
i
think
once
the
order
terminating
both
of
their
parental
rights,
in
effect
giving
their
children
to
strangers,
is
vacated,
then
in
effect
those
interests,
the
state
courts
may
have
to
adjudicate
those
interests
if
they
decide
they
conflict.
my
discussions
with
the
parents
at
this
point
is
that
they
don't
seem
to
conflict.
she
is
more
than
willing
to
have
custody
and
he
is
willing
to
have
that.
she
is
more
than
willing
to
allow
him
to
have
visitation,
given
the
distance
he
is
away,
and
she's
more
than
willing
to
allow
that.
that's
the
discussions
we've
had.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
when
did
they
separate?
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
record
below
does
not
reflect
that.
she
was
married
in
july
of
1977.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
they
had
separated
prior
to
the
final
opinion
of
the
delaware
supreme
court.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
they
knew
they
were
separated.
in
the
delaware
supreme
court
opinion...
appendix.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
you
mean
the
parties'
separation?
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
can
only
speculate
that
that
information
was
given
to
the
delaware
supreme
court
and
was--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--no.
but
it
was
given
to
the
delaware
supreme
court
and
they
didn't
think
a
remand
with
those
new
facts
was
appropriate.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
no,
because
we
believe
that
even
though
those
facts
existed
in
'75--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--there
was
no
specific
request
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
to
remand
with
those
factual
situations
changed.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
the
parents
aren't
seeking
if
this
order
would
be
overturned
to
get
their
children
back,
given
the
passage
of
time,
the
next
day.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
they
want
to
regain
contact
with
the
children
and
work
towards
eventually
having
them
reintegrated
into
their
home.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
that's
correct;
as
a
starting
point.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
yes,
i
believe
it
is,
if
it...
well--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--not
by
direct
appeal,
it's
not.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
until
you
rule
it's
not
final.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
no.
those
facts
have
been
told
to
the
delaware
supreme
court.
as
i
indicated,
originally,
the
trial
court
agreed
with
the
division
that
the
half
brother...
half
sister
relationship
of
the
parents
wasn't
sufficient
to
be
the
"not
fitted"
conduct.
an
appeal
was
then
taken
to
the
delaware
supreme
court.
the
delaware
supreme
court
did
not
reach
any
of
the
legal
issues
but
remanded
it
back
to
the
trial
court
to
have
a
separate
findings
made
on
the
second
statutory
standard
of
"best
interests".
a
five
day
trial
was
held
in
the
trial
court
and
as
i
indicated,
although
the
term
"best
interest"
seems
to
mandate
some
sort
of
comparative
analysis,
the
trial
court
and
the
state
resisted
any
efforts
by
the
parents
to
show
what
type
of
care
the
children
were
receiving
while
they
were
in
the
state's
custody.
what
information
did
leak
through
is
that
the
oldest
child
had
been,
during
her
period,
while
she
was
in
the
state's
custody,
had
been
shuffled
back
and
forth
between
nine
different
foster
care
placements.
at
the
end
of
that
the
trial
court
entered
a
final
judgment
indicating
that
it
found
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
children
to
terminate
their
parental
rights,
based
on
several
factors.
one
was
frequent
moves
of
the
parents,
as
mr.
doe
frequently
changed
jobs.
the
second
was
the
half
brother
and
half
sister
relationship
of
the
parents.
and
the
third
was
the
prior
conviction
mr.
doe
had
suffered
for
a
misdemeanor
of
offensive
touching.
that
last
factor
was
a
hotly
contested
issue.
it
arose
in
1973
when
the
division
charged
mr.
doe
with
sexually
assaulting
one
of
his
daughters.
after
a
trial
on
that
matter
he
was
acquitted
of
any
sexual
offense.
he
did
suffer
an
offensive
touching
conviction
and
was
placed
on
probation.
he
described
the
conduct
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
conviction.
it
was
playfully
placing
his
tongue
on
his
2-1/2-year-old
daughter's
nose
and
mouth.
again,
the
case
was
returned
to
the
delaware
supreme
court.
they
rejected
the
parents'
vagueness
challenge
to
the
statutory
standards,
they
upheld
the
trial
court's
use
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
they
found
specifically
that
the
half
brother...
half
sister
relationship
was
the
triggering
criterion,
not
fitted
criterion.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
we
think
that
the
only
interest
that
the
state
can
assert
in
a
termination
of
parental
rights
that's
so
compelling
is
prevention
of
actual
substantial
or
imminent
harm
to
the
children.
any
less
intrusion
without
proving
that
is
not
permissible.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
pardon
me,
justice
marshall?
mr.
gary
a.
myers
physical
harm,
surely,
and
mental
harm
when
it's
characterized
by
some
overt
symptoms,
not
merely
speculation,
but
symptoms
such
as
aggressiveness
withdrawal
and
so
forth.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
i
think
the
trial
courts
decide
these
types
of
issues
every
day
and
it's
not
difficult
to
show
those
types
of
actual
harm.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
think
that
the
appropriate
way
for
state
legislatures
to
go
in
this
field
is,
in
effect,
to
spell
out
the
criteria
of
harm.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
think
that's
required
so
that
individual
social
workers
or
judges
don't
in
effect
define
within
vague
statutes
what
their
own
ideas
of
good
parenting
or
bad
parenting
are.
it's
a
legislative
choice
and
the
legislature
should
set
those
criteria.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
think
that's
why
the
legislature
should
look
to
harm
to
the
children
rather
than
trying
to
detail
any
right
or
wrong
parent.
if
there's
any
harm
to
children
they're
in
effect
looking
to
the
welfare
of
the
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
if
the
legislature
defined
the
welfare--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--a
construction
that
would
limit
welfare
to
harm,
i
think,
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
if
the
harm
was
in
effect
actual
harm
or
imminent
threat
of
actual
harm,
whether
that
be
psychological
or
physical.
the
problem
with
dealing
with
it
on
a
case
to
case
basis
without
any
criteria
of
what
the
legislature
has
denominated
as
harmful
is
that
that's
an
easy
way
for
judges
in
effect
to
impose
their
own
values.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
that
case
is
not
before
you
today.
i
think
the
state
can
by
imposing--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--unless
returning
these
children
to
their
parents
would
cause
them
actual
harm.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
when
the
state
is
trying
to
take
children
from
both
of
their
parents
and
give
them
to
someone--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--well,
i
think
they
can
return
to
their
natural
family,
if
the
state
in
effect
can't
show
that
it's
going
to
cause
harm
that
the--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--well,
i
think
that
any
time
the
state
seeks
to
intrude
in
a
family,
that
in
effect
the
state
surely
has
to
show
some
possibility
of
harm
at
the
custody
stage
and
much
more
at
the
termination
state
where
in
effect
it's
permanent.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
there's
been
no
finding
below
and
i
think
that
that's
the
responsibility
of
the
state
court.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
i
think
that
any
of
the
criteria
that
the
trial
court
lists,
frequent
moves
of
the
family,
the
half
brother
and
half
sister
relationship,
would
not
support
a
finding
of
sufficient
harm
for
them
to
in
effect
permanently
break
up
this
family.
the
moving
of
a
family
as
the
father
changed
jobs
is
something
that
occurs
to
millions
of
american
families,
i
believe.
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
the
half
brother...
half
sister
relationship
which
showed
that
that
caused
any
harm
to
these
children
who
were
already
in
existence.
the
experts
brought
forth
by
the
state
who
generally
had
never
seen
the
parents
nor
the
children
even
in
that
situation
disclaimed
any
reliance
upon
the
half
brother...
half
sister
relationship
as
causing
any
harm
to
the
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
they
were
half
brother
and
half
sister
and
had
five
children
and
they
were
convicted
of
the
crime.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
that's
a
decision
that
the
delaware
legislature
has
not
made
and
that's
a
problem
with
the
"not
fitted"
conduct.
there's
no
explicit
grounds
in
delaware
that
says
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
means
the
forfeiture
of
your
children.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
my
personal
opinion?
mr.
gary
a.
myers
in
the
absence
of
showing
any
of
the
types
of
harm
i've
outlined
before,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
state
had
any
reason
to
take
children
from
both
of
these
parents.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
absent
the
showing
that
the
conviction
and
the
conduct
that
caused
the
conviction
harmed
the
child,
there
should
be
no
reason
for
the
state
to
intervene.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
think,
in
the
absence
of
harm,
i
think
it
has--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--well,
i
think
my
response
would
be
twofold.
initially,
in
effect
stating
standards
of
conduct
as
to
how
you
drive
an
automobile,
how
you
run
a
commercial
business,
where
there
may
be
accepted
standards
outside
the
law,
is
a
lot
different
than
when
a
state
tries
to
interfere
in
a
family,
something
this
court
has
recognized
as
a
fundamental
interest
to
both
the
parents
and
the
children.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
while
we're
not
asking
for
absolute
certainty,
the
delaware
statute
used
against
these
parents
without
any
statutory
definition,
without
any
narrow
construction,
is
surely
vague.
it
doesn't
give
any
guidance
to
anyone
either
under
the
"not
fitted"
standard
or
the
"best
interest"
standard.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
i
think
this
court
has
now
in
effect
required
the
states
to
in
effect
take
into
those...
to
legislate
and
make
law
the
types
of
factors
the
jury
would
consider.
that's
what
basically,
as
we've
pointed
out
the
examples
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
and
some
of
the
amici
point
out,
that
that
would
be
the
proper
way
for
the
courts
to
go
about
this
procedure,
not
try
to
detail
and
outline
every
type
of
conduct
a
parent
can
or
cannot
do,
but
in
effect
delineate
the
types
of
harm
that
will
be
sufficient
and
will
allow
judges
to
decide
whether
in
effect
parental
rights
should
be
forever
forfeit.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
i
think--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--that's
a
difficult
issue.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
and
it
should
be
decided
on
that
case
if
the
legislature
makes
that
choice.
the
delaware
legislature
has
not
made
that
choice.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
to
say
that
conviction
of
a
misdemeanor
of
incest
was
the
triggering
criterion.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
as
i
responded
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
my
feeling
is,
in
the
absence
of
a
final
determination
that
that
conduct
caused
harm
to
the
children--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--no,
no.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
as
to
my
personal
belief
whether
that
would
be--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--no.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
surely
it
would
eliminate
the
vagueness
problem,
but
not
the
substantive
due
process
problem.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i'll
just
briefly
point
out
that
the
third
issue
presented
to
this
court
is
the
proper
standards
of
proof.
recently
in
addington
v.
texas
this
court
has
outlined
those
factors
where
the
constitution
compels
states
to
require
in
its
judicial
proceeding
something
beyond
a
mere
preponderance
of
evidence,
and
to
apply
the
addington
criteria
of
loss
of
liberty,
stigmatization,
and
the
possibility
of
decisions
based
on
unauthorized
conduct.
those
factors
clearly
are
present
in
a
tpr.
there
is
an
additional
criterion,
as
i
pointed
out,
in
a
tpr
that
wasn't
present
in
addington.
in
addington
an
original
commitment
could
in
effect
be
changed,
an
erroneous
original
commitment
could
be
changed.
in
a
tpr
an
original
erroneous
termination
is
forever.
it
cannot
be
changed.
and
despite
the
state's
protest
i
don't
think
a
higher
standard
of
proof
as
we
asked
for
causes
any
problems.
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
numerous
states
have
adopted
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
and
when
congress
has
spoken
on
the
issue
it
has
required
a
showing
of
harm,
and
has
required
a
showing
of
harm
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
did
so
analogizing
that
tpr
was
in
effect
a
greater
punishment
than
a
criminal
conviction.
in
sum,
unless
the
lower
courts
are
reversed,
the
state
of
delaware
will
have
taken
these
children
from
their
parents
under
an
ill
defined
standard
by
proving
its
case
by
a
mere
preponderance
of
evidence,
and
without
any
demonstration
that
any
of
the
children
had
been
harmed
by
the
parents'
conduct.
in
so
doing,
because
of
the
sterilization,
the
state
will
have
taken
the
only
children
these
parents
will
ever
have.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
at
this
point,
concerning
the
remand
question,
i
think
the
remand
question
and
the
questions
we've
been
posed
concerning
the
vagueness
issues,
regardless
of
the
change
in
the
statutory
language
of
the
new
section,
i
think
the
other
two
constitutional
issues
which
we
raised
are
properly
before
the
court
and
would
have
to
be
decided
regardless
of
any
remand.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
well,
i
think
that
the
standard
of
proof
argument
is
not
going
to
disappear,
and
a
remand
may
entail
another
evidentiary
hearing
and
to
allow
it
to
go
forward
under
what
we
contend
is
an
impermissible
standard
of
proof
should
not
be--
mr.
gary
a.
myers
--well,
i
think
the
lower
courts
need
some
instructions.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
and
again,
i
would
point
out
as
to
the
substantive
due
process,
i
think
it's
before
this
court
because
i
think
the
delaware
court
in
this
case
and
other
cases,
what
few
there
are,
has
indicated
that
it's
not
going
to
require
harm
and
we
think
that's
the
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
parents
it
would
be
whether
they
presently
meet
whatever
statutory
requirements
the
state
courts
would
apply.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
i
would
respectfully
beg
off
on
that
because
i'm
not
sure
whether
delaware
would
apply
the
present
law.
mr.
gary
a.
myers
thank
you.
