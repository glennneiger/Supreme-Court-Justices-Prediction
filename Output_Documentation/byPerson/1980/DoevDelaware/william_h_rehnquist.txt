justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
myers,
in
reading
the
opinion
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
at
page
199
of
atlantic,
2d,
the
court
says
that
"under
our
statute
there
must
also
be
a
finding
that
the
termination
of
parental
rights
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
"
indicating
that
parental
unfitness
is
not
by
itself
sufficient.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
it
wouldn't
have
been
sufficient,
as
i
read
the
delaware
supreme
court
opinion.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
myers,
is
it
part
of
your
position
that
a
state
may
not
ever
terminate
parental
rights?
justice
rehnquist
then
you
think
also
that
the
criteria
for
termination
have
to
be
spelled
out
in
some
detail,
i
take
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
appropriate
isn't
really
what
i
had
in
mind,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
constitutional
question.
you
think
the
states
are
required
to
list
factors?
justice
rehnquist
i'm
just
trying
to
get
your
position.
well,
haven't
courts
run
into
problems
before
when
they
have
attempted
to
lay
down
very
definite
criteria
such
as
justice
holmes
in
the
earlier
days
of
railroads,
when
he
said,
we
declare
it
to
be
negligent
as
a
matter
of
law
when
you
come
to
a
railway
crossing
and
fail
to
obey
the
"stop,
look,
and
listen.
"
sign,
or
when
in
the
mcgautha
opinion
justice
harlan
referred
to
the
royal
commission
report
saying
that
it
had
just
proved
impossible,
virtually,
to
define
the
standards
that
made
one
subject
to
capital
punishment,
that
there's
necessarily
an
element
of
vagueness
there.
negligence
embraces
so
many
situations
in
the
tort
field
that
i
don't
think
any
court
today
says
that
it's
vague
because
all
we
require
is
negligence
and
the
jury
deliberates
as
to
what
is
negligent
and
what
is
not.
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
capital
punishment
in
the
mcgautha
case?
