well,
am
i
correct
that
neither
mother
nor
father
has
seen
these
children
in
several
years?
justice
jr.
no,
no;
but
they
have
not
seen
the
children
in
several
years,
have
they?
justice
jr.
they
are
now
separated,
are
they
not?
justice
jr.
she
is
now
married?
justice
jr.
but
all
they
want,
really,
is
access
to
these
children,
just
want
to
know
where
they
are,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
there
are
five
children?
justice
jr.
and
she
wants
all
five?
and
how
old
are
the
children
now?
justice
jr.
six
through
nine?
five
of
them?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
when
it
ends
the
relationship
with
the
parents
i
gather
it
has
the
same
effect
as
an
adoption,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
no,
but
in
terms
of
termination
of
any
relationship
of
parent
and
child,
doesn't
it
have
the
same
effect
as
an
adoption?
justice
jr.
and
did
they?
