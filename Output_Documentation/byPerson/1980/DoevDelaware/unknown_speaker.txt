unknown
speaker
i'm
getting
back
to
what
justice
white
was
talking
about,
i
don't
know
what
we've
got
here.
the
one
side--
unknown
speaker
--one
side
argues
that
this
lady
is
dying
to
get
these
children
back,
and
the
record
shows
she
is
married
to
another
man
whom
nobody
vouches
for.
now,
what
conclusion
can
i
draw?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
deny
that
she
wants
these
children?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
this
suit
one
example
of
positive
assertion?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
any
evidence
that
she
does
not
want
them,
and
if
so
why
haven't
they
given
it
to
her?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is,
fit
or
unfit,
it
is
true
that
she
wants
the
children?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
anything
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
to
the
contrary?
the
answer
is,
no.
right?
so,
we'll
just
take
that
point.
i'm
not
saying
how
important
it
is.
doe
and
roe
are
no
longer
living
together?
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
obviously,
if
they...
they
couldn't
both
want
the
children
as
parents
of
the
children
and
as
co
homemakers
for
the
children
because
they're
not
co
homemakers
anymore
for
even
themselves,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
he
also
said
that
she
wanted
them.
he
said
positively
that
she
wanted
the
children.
what
becomes
of
john
doe
then?
but
the
question
is,
did
he
say
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
thank
you.
now,
do
you
have
anything
to
contradict
that,
any
fact?
unknown
speaker
ms.
small,
i'd
be
interested
in
your
discussion
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
i
thought
we
took
this
case
to
consider.
unknown
speaker
now,
mrs.
small,
you
said
that
you
thought
that
only
one
constitutional
issue
is
properly
here.
counsel
for
the
appellants
says
that
three
constitutional
issues
are
properly
here.
why
do
you
think
the
others
are
not
properly
here?
unknown
speaker
i.e.,
the
burden
of
proof,
and
the
substantive
due
process
standard,
as
he
calls
it,
that
any
state
need
establish
that
there
be
harm
to
the
children
before
it
can
terminate
the
parents'
relationship.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
second
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
you
concede
that--
unknown
speaker
--the
argument
was
clearly
made
that
a
standard
of
proof
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
was
constitutionally
impermissible
and
insufficient.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
small,
may
i
ask
you
this?
this
has
reference
to
delaware's
new
statute.
i've
just
looked
at
it
and
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
the
standard
under
the
new
statute,
which
is
best
interests
of
the
children,
is
surely
quite
different
from
the
standard
under
the
old
statute
of
not
fitted.
and
my
question
to
you
is
this,
in
bell
and
maryland,
where
we
vacated
a
state
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
judgment
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
new
law
in
the
state
of
maryland,
we
relied
on
patterson
and
alabama
in
294
united
states
600,
where
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
stated
the
following,
and
my
question
to
you
is,
why
isn't
this
statement
applicable
in
this
case?
chief
justice
hughes
said,
"we
have
frequently
held
that
in
the
exercise
of
our
appellate
jurisdiction
we
have
power
not
only
to
correct
error
in
the
judgment
under
review
but
to
make
such
disposition
of
the
case
as
justice
requires.
"
"and
in
determining
what
justice
does
require,
the
court
is
bound
to
consider
any
change
either
in
fact
or
in
law
which
has
supervened
since
the
judgment
was
entered.
"
"we
may
recognize
such
a
change,
which
may
affect
the
result,
by
setting
aside
the
judgment
and
remanding
the
case
so
that
the
state
court
may
be
free
to
act.
"
"we
have
said
that
to
do
this
is
not
to
review
in
any
proper
sense
of
the
term
the
decision
of
the
state
court
upon
a
non
federal
question
but
only
to
deal
appropriately
with
a
matter
arising
since
its
judgment
and
having
a
bearing
upon
the
right
disposition
of
the
case.
"
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
neither
you
nor
we,
i
gather,
really
know
what
the
delaware
state
courts
would
do
if
we
sent
this
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
how
they
would
interpret
it,
how
they
would
deal
with
any
constitutional
challenge
to
it,
we
don't
know,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
we
ought
not
decide
the
constitutional
questions
tendered
if
the
delaware
courts
would
on
reconsideration
apply
that
new
statute,
should
we?
unknown
speaker
your
practical,
your
so
called
practical
answer
to
my
brother
white
earlier,
however,
would
still
be
applicable
here,
that
any
delay
would
delay
the
potential
adoption
of
these
children.
unknown
speaker
of
course
it
is.
it
is
anywhere.
unknown
speaker
a
child
can't
have
two
mothers
and
two
fathers.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
rather
have
a
remand,
though,
than
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
whole
point,
i
gather,
of
chief
justice
hughes'
statement
in
the
patterson
case,
and
it's
been
followed
in
a
great
many
others,
including
bell
and
maryland
where
it
was
quoted,
is
that
this
court
ought
not
determine
constitutional
questions
if
perhaps
they
will
disappear
on
reconsideration
under
the
new
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
you
may
win.
unknown
speaker
you
may
win,
and
then
we
may
never
have
to
decide
the
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
myers,
under
your
view
of
the
law,
if
there
were
a
remand
and
a
new
hearing,
what
would
the
issue
be
at
the
hearing,
whether
the
parents
are
presently
unfit
or
whether
they
were
unfit
in
1976?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
present
law.
under
the
present
law.
the
facts
are
quite
different
than
they
were
five
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it.
i
understand
you
would
like
to
have
a
decision
here;
yes.
