mr.
c.
lee
reeves
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
petitioner
j.
truett
payne
company.
we
filed
this
secondary
line
robinson-patman
act
price
discrimination
case,
resulted
in
a
verdict
and
judgment
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
after
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict
was
denied,
in
the
5th
circuit
it
was
appealed
and
the
5th
circuit
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
plaintiff,
petitioner
in
this
instance,
must
prove
the
specific
lost
sales
or
lost
profits.
and
that
is
the
only
method
of
proving
the
fact
of
the
injury.
and
a
second
and
underlying
factor
in
the
reversal
was
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
prove
a
reasonable
estimate
of
the
amount
of
the
price
discrimination
or
damage
and
that
the
actual
amount
of
the
discrimination
was
not
sufficient
by
which
the
court
could
estimate
the
damage,
or
by
which
the
jury
could
estimate
the
damage.
this
court
is
faced
with
the
damage
issues
under
the
robinson-patman
act
and
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
which
bring
into
focus
the
5th
circuit's
requirement
of
a
plaintiff
proving
specific
lost
profits
or
lost
sales
as
the
only
means
of
recovering
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
and
whether
or
not
that
requirement
imposes
an
inflated
standard
of
proof
thereby
effectively
denying
private
attorney
generals
the
ability
to
enforce
the
act
and
recover
for
a
wrong;
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
the
amount
of
the
price
differential
is
sufficient
evidence
to
give
a
reasonable
and
proper
estimate
of
the
amount
of
the
damage.
the
5th
circuit
in
its
opinion
misconstrues
not
only
the
law
but
i
believe
in
misconstruing
the
law
underlying
the
problem
was
misconstruing
payne's
position.
it
stated
that
payne
claimed
that
in
a
total
vacuum
price
discrimination
alone
was
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
an
injury
under
section
4
of
the
act,
of
the
clayton
act.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
totally
ignored
this
court's
findings
and
holdings
in
bruce's
juices
case,
in
1947,
and
the
ftc
v.
morton
salt
case
in
1948.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
say
that
if
price
discrimination
alone
with
absolutely
no
other
evidence
is
the
only
evidence
before
the
court,
then
i
would
say
that
that's
true;
that
price
discrimination
in
a
vacuum
cannot
be
found
to
cause
injury.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
think
you
have
got
to
go
farther.
i
would
not
mind
that
finding.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
but
i
would
submit
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
that
in
this
case
there
was
substantial
corroborating
evidence
supporting
an
inference
of
injury
resulting
from
substantial
price
discrimination
taking
place,
occurring
in
a
market
where
there
was
keen
competition
and
in
the
face
of
tight
profit
margins,
and
where
the
substantial
price
discrimination
could
have
been
reflected
in
the
retail
sales
price.
now,
under
those
circumstances
the
5th
circuit
didn't
address
that,
it
just
said,
the
only
way
that
you
could
prove
injury
is
to
show
proof
of
lost
sales
and
lost
profits,
but
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case
the
jury,
the
fact
finder,
whether
it
be
a
jury
or
a
court,
could
have
inferred
injury
from
the
existence
of
those
factors,
plus
the
price
discrimination
itself.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
that
this
court
need
not
address
whether
or
not
price
discrimination
standing
alone
in
a
vacuum
gives
rise
to
injury
or
competitive
injury.
because
the
facts
of
this
case
show
a
substantial
supporting...
substantial
corroborating
evidence
supporting
not
only
the
proof
of
actual
competitive
injury,
not
just
a
finding
of
a
likelihood
or
probability
of
injury,
but
testimony
that
competition
itself
was
harmed,
and
support
an
inference
that
would
support
the
jury's
finding
which
could
give
rise
to
an
inference
of
damage
to
the
disfavored
purchaser.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
under
the...
no
other
rebutting
evidence
whatsoever,
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do.
because
that
would
then
be
a
case
where
you
would
have
price
discrimination,
not
in
a
vacuum,
but
disregarding
mr.
payne's
testimony,
which
the
5th
circuit
discounts
by
saying
that
this
is
a
conclusion
of
one
of
the
injured
parties,
i
still
say
that
it
is
corroborating
evidence
which
put
together
with
the
vast
amount
of
other
corroborating
evidence
would
permit
at
least,
at
the
very
least,
the
jury
to
determine
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
there
was
damage.
and
the
5th
circuit
says,
it
doesn't
address
these
other--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--i
believe,
under
even
the
standards
that
this
court
has
established
on
proof
of
damage
and
proof
of
amount
of
damage,
that
you
would
have
to
go
farther
than
just
mere
self
serving
conclusions
in
the
absence
of
any
other
supporting
evidence.
however,
if...
like
in
this
case...
the
amounts
of
the
price
discriminations
which
resulted...
chrysler,
in
a
rebate
program...
let
me
just
go
into
the
background
just
a
moment,
if
it
please
the
court.
rebate
programs
were
formulated
by
chrysler
whereby
the
amount
of
money
that
was
paid
to
the
competing
dealers
in
the
birmingham
market
was
determined
by
a
quota
that
was
reached,
or
not
reached,
by
the
competing
dealers.
the
quotas
were
different
for
each
dealer,
and
the
price
rebate
would
thereby
lower
the
price
and
cause
the
discrimination,
if
everybody
were
not
rebated
the
same
price
on
the
same
model
automobile.
and
in
this
case
there
was
evidence
of
substantial
amounts
of
discrimination
occurring,
sometimes
several
hundred
dollars
per
automobile,
in
a
period...
we're
talking
about
50
or
more
automobiles
a
month,
and
these
rebate
programs
lasted
two
and
three
months
in
duration.
so,
when
you
put
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
together
with
mr.
payne's
testimony,
the
actual
fact
of
the
price
discrimination,
the
duration
of
the
substantial
nature
of
it,
and
the
amounts
of
it,
then
i
say
that
that
would
be
an
issue
that
should
be
submitted
to
the
trier
of
fact,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
trier
of
fact
could
infer
damage
without
proof
of
specific
lost
sales
or
lost
profits.
the
testimony
in
this
case
showed
that
during
a
3-1/2-year
period
from
approximately
december,
1970...
november,
1973...
may,
1974,
when
payne
went
out
of
business,
that
the
price
discrimination
totalled
about
$81,000.
there
were
16
rebate
programs
which
caused
the
price
discrimination,
and
of
those
16
programs
13
caused
damage
to
payne,
and
that
damaged...
that
payne
was
not
favored,
he
was
a
disfavored
dealer
in
those
13.
of
those
other
three
programs,
one
of
the
programs
was
a
program
that
had
a
quota
established
by
chrysler
by
which
the
dealer
had
to
reach
that
quota
in
order
to
get
paid
and
payne
reached
that
one
quota
and
did
not
get
injured
in
that
program.
the
other
two
programs
where
there
was
no
discrimination
were
an
across
the
board
percentage
rebate
to
everybody
on
a
per
car
basis,
so
there
was
no
discrimination
at
all.
so,
out
of
those
16
programs
over
a
3-1/2-year
period,
payne
was
injured,
was
a
disfavored
dealer
in
13
of
them.
there
was
testimony
not
only
by
payne
that
his
company
lost
business
in
the
form
of
lost
sales,
but
also
that
his
company
in
order
to
maintain
sales
had
to
overallow
on
the
used
car
trade
in
and
that
was
a
factor
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
ignatin
and
in
the
testimony,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
chrysler's
witnesses
which
analyzed
the
used
car
business
of
payne,
saying
that,
one,
that
the
main
problem
with
payne
was
its
used
car
business
was
losing
money.
so
you've
got
the
fact
that
payne
testified
that
he
was
overallowing
in
order
to
get
business
coupled
with
the
corroborating
testimony
that
there
was
a
real
problem
in
the
used
car
business,
coupled
with
a
factor
of
substantial,
sustained
price
discriminations
over
3-1/2
years.
there
was
testimony
of
an
actual
decline
in
the
market,
percentage
of
the
market
that
payne
had
from
1971
and
1972.
there
was
also
testimony
that
the
price
discrimination
adversely
affected
competition
and
injured
competition
because
it
had
a
two
pronged
effect.
the
first
thing
was
that
it
did
not
permit
payne
to
compete
on
an
even
and
equal
basis.
he
was
at
a
trade
disadvantage
because
his
cars
cost
more
than
the
other
competing
dealers.
secondly,
the
price
of
a
new
car
is
determined
by
the
discounting
off
of
the
list
price,
and
everybody
knows
that,
and
the
economist
that
analyzed
the
industry
in
birmingham
determined
that
because
the
competing
dealers,
the
favored
dealers,
did
not
have
to
discount
off
list
price
quite
as
much
as
they
otherwise
would
have
since
they
were
favored
and
payne
was
not
favored
with
the
rebate,
with
the
price
discrimination,
and
because
payne
could
not
discount
off
list
price
as
much
as
he
otherwise
would
have
done
because
of
the
lack
of
the
price
rebate,
that
that
raised
the
price,
the
ultimate
retail
price
to
the
consumer
in
the
market
to
a
slight
degree.
and
the
5th
circuit
in
its
opinion
did
not
consider
all
of
this
evidence
as
giving
rise
at
least
to
the
submission
to
a
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
injury
in
fact
under
the
antitrust
laws
could
be
caused.
the
5th
circuit
said
that
the
only
way
you
can
prove
injury
is
to
prove
lost
profits
or
lost
sales.
this
court
considered
the
same
issue
in
a
different
context
in
bruce's
juices
v.
american
can
company,
and
in
that
case,
although
the
ultimate
finding
was
much
narrower,
the
court
was
faced
with
an
analysis
exactly
the
same
as
in
this
case,
because
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
said
that
the
price
discrimination
statute
ought
to
void
the
contract
involved
in
the
transaction
where
there
was
price
discrimination.
the
court
said,
and
the
plaintiff
also
said,
that
the
treble
damage
remedy
under
the
robinson-patman
act
was
ineffective.
this
court
said,
no,
because
all
that
there
would
be
normal,
or
all
that
would
be
necessary
in
the
absence
of
extraordinary
circumstances
would
be
to
prove
the
substantial
price
differential,
and
that
would
be
damage,
and
the
amount
of
that
damage
would
be
that
differential.
in
that
finding,
and
it's
more
than
mere
dictum...
i
know
that
chrysler
characterized
it
as
dictum...
but
this
court
had
to
analyze
how
you
would
prove
price
discrimination
how
you
would
prove
damage
under
the
act
that
would
be
an
effective
remedy.
and
it
recognized
that,
it
recognized
what
chrysler
ignores,
and
what
the
5th
circuit
ignores,
and
that
is
that
the
defendant
in
a
price
discrimination
case
would
always
have
the
chance
of
rebutting
the
inference
of
injury.
it's
not
an
automatic
injury
rule,
despite
their
characterization
of
it;
it
gives
rise
to
an
inference
of
injury.
the
factfinder
should
be
allowed
to
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
injury
or
not.
and
if
substantial
evidence
is
introduced
by
the
defendant
showing
that
these
"extraordinary
circumstances"
exist
in
the
marketplace,
then
price
discrimination,
whether
it
be
substantial
or
sustained,
is
not
going
to
give
rise
to
the
damage.
but
it
is
a
jury
issue.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
only
in
the
context,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
of
the
competition
in
the
market,
because
that
in
effect
reduced
the
price.
there
was
testimony
by
both
the
expert
witnesses
that
that
reduced
the
price
of
automobiles
and
that
the
automobiles,
originally,
each
model
was
priced
the
same.
therefore,
the
product
that
was
being
sold
in
the
market
was
costed,
cost
more
to
payne
than
it
did
to
the
other
dealers
who
were
competing
in
that
very
same
time
frame
under
that
very
same
program
for
the
sale
to
the
very
same
customers
in
that
market,
and
that
put
payne
at
a
total
disadvantage
in
sales.
now,
there
are
several
things
that
can
happen
when
that
occurs.
the
disfavored
purchaser
could
keep
his
same
price
and
eat
the
higher
cost,
and
reduce
the
profit.
or
he
could
have
passed
the
price
increase,
the
higher
cost,
along
to
the
customer,
in
which
there's
an
expectation
of
lost
sales.
but
this
court
has
said
in
hanover
shoe
case
and
in
the
illinois
brisk
case
that
it
is
insurmountable
almost
to
predict
the
effect
of
the
higher
cost
of
a
product
upon,
or
measure
the
effect
a
higher
cost
will
have
on
the
sales
of
a
company.
and
therefore,
to
require
proof
of
an
actual
loss
in
sales
volume
traceable
directly
to
the
price
discrimination
as
the
only
means
of
proving
the
fact
of
damage,
flies
in
the
face
of
what
this
court
has
said
is
the
policy
behind
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
to
a
certain
extent
it's
true
that
chrysler's
rebates
lessened
the
price,
the
ultimate
price
of
the
car
to
my
client.
but
it
didn't,
it
put
our
client
at
a
disadvantage,
because
our
client
had
a
higher
cost
on
those
very
same
cars
than
the
favored
dealers.
i
think
that
what
you
may
be
getting
at
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
there
was
a
benefit
to
my
client,
does
that
countervail
away
against
the
fact
that
there
was
a
larger
benefit
to
his
competitor?
and
i
submit
that
the
answer
is
an
unqualified
no;
it
doesn't
matter
that
payne
received
a
benefit,
because
ultimately
the
other
people,
the
competing
dealers,
received
a
less
priced
automobile
and
were
able
to
take
away
either
sales
either
profits,
or
either
use
more
customer
attracting
services
and
get
the
business
and
let
payne
not
withstand
the
difficult
times
in
the
market
that
eventually
caused
its
demise.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
it
is.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
it's
an
injury
to
competition;
yes,
it
is.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i
read
their
opinion
correctly,
stated
that
the
proof
of
price
discrimination
by
itself
does
not
prove
competitive
injury,
nor
does
it
prove--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--that's
correct.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
it
did
not--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--that's...
right.
they
never
addressed
whether
or
not
under
the
elements
of
section
2(a)
of
the
act
were
met.
but
it
simply
went
off
on
the
fact
that
no
injury,
according
to
it,
was
proved,
because
no
lost
profits
and
no
lost
sales
were
shown.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
absolutely.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
think
that
the
5th
circuit
recognized
that.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
well,
they
distinguished
paying
more
for
cars
and
lost
profits.
they
distinguished
that
by
saying
under
the
enterprise
doctrine
that
just
means
that
my
client
was
not
as
well
off
as
the
more
favored
dealers.
it
did
not...
this
is
their
rationale,
this
is
the
5th
circuit
rationale...
that
it
didn't
damage
payne
because
he
had
to
pay
a
higher
price,
it
merely
made
the
other
competitors
in
a
better
position.
well,
that's
turning
the
whole
theory
of
price
discrimination
on
its
head,
as
it
were,
because
the
evil
that
price
discrimination
is
designed
to
remedy
is
the
difference,
the
lower
cost,
to
the
favored
dealer.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
say
it's
an
overcharge
or
an
undercharge,
it's
still
an
injury
in
the
form
of
eventually--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--yes,
you
can,
mr.
justice
white.
that
ignores
the
economic
reality
of
the
marketplace
in
that
had
the
disfavored
dealer
received
a
lower
cost,
it
might
have
and
could
have
theoretically
in
a
competitive
market
reduced
its
sales
price,
retail
sales
price,
maximized
its
volume,
keeping
the
same
profit
margin,
and
thereby,
since
it
had
more
volume
and
more
profit...
more
volume
times
the
same
profit
margin,
it
lost
profits.
and
that
is
the
whole
theory
of
our
economic
system.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
well,
the
favored
dealer
may
not
have
wanted
to
pick
up
sales.
it
could
have
kept
its
same
price.
i
believe
that's
what
your
hypothetical
envisioned.
and
therefore
it
could
have
done
a
lot
of
things.
it
could
have
cut
back
on
its
advertising,
it
could
have
pocketed
the
additional
profit,
it
could
have
done
a
lot
of
things.
but
the
end
result
is
that
because
the
favored
dealer
has
a
lower
cost
the
economic
opportunities,
the
position
in
the
market
of
the
disfavored
purchaser
is
injured.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
morton
salt.
and
it
used
the
words,
"there
is
an
obvious
inference
of
damage.
"
to
a
merchant
that
pays
a
higher
price
for
the
same
product
than
its
competing
merchants
and
the
competing
seller.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
i
mentioned
just
briefly
that
the
economist
testified
that
the
price
discrimination
resulted
in
a
two
pronged
effect.
number
one,
it
made
my
client
less
able
to
compete,
less
able
to
have
as
much
profit.
secondly,
it
raised
slightly
the
retail
sales
price
to
the
ultimate
consumer
in
the
market.
therefore
you
have
two
types
of
injuries
to
competition.
certainly
competition
is
supposed
to
envision
the
most
efficient
use
of
resources
to
get
the
lowest
price
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
as,
in
his
view,
that
was
the
effect
of
that
type
of
rebate
program.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
that's
another
piece
of
corroborating
evidence
that
supports--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--that's
true,
but
the
court
of
appeals
again
took
the
position,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
despite
the
expert
testimony
by
dr.
ignatin
that
the
price
discrimination...
if
there
had
not
been
any
price
discrimination,
payne
would
not
have
gone
out
of
business.
they
said
that's
just
not
supportable.
why?
i
don't
know.
it
may
have
been
that
in
a
footnote
to
the
opinion
in
the
5th
circuit
they
said
that
dr.
ignatin
prefaced
his
testimony
about
that
by
saying
that
it
was
speculation.
well,
that
is
an
inaccurate
statement
and
i
mentioned
that
in
my
brief
on
the
merits,
and
the
5th
circuit
just
made
an
error,
because
i
cited
to
the
record
where
he
answered
a
question,
that
it's
speculative.
he
answered
in
that
fashion,
to
a
question
from
counsel
for
chrysler
that,
is
there
any
way
to
formulate
a
rebate
program
that
does
not
discriminate?
he
said,
well,
it's
speculative,
but
i
can
tell
you
this,
had
there
not
been
any
discrimination,
absent
that,
payne
would
not
have
gone
out
of
business.
and
that
was
the
testimony,
and
how
that
can
be
discounted
when
an
expert
economist...
that's
the
only
way
we
can
try
to
prove
injury
is
to
get
someone
other
than
conclusory
statements
which
the
5th
circuit
has
said
is
not
permissible.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
think
that's
a
good
inference,
if
you
will,
from
the
reading
of
the
5th
circuit's
opinion
but
i
would
like
to
say
also
that
the
statutory
requirements
under
section
2(a)
are
even
less
than
showing
injury
to
competition.
all
you
need
to
show
is
a
probability
of
injury
to
competition.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
to
show
a
violation--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--not
the
competition,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
he
could
prove
injury
to
the
business,
the
disfavored
purchaser,
because
he
is...
competition.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think,
in
your
way
of
saying
it,
because
proof
of
injury
to
the
business
is
proof
of
injury
to
competition.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
powell.
we
contend
that
injury
to
a
business
is
in
fact
injury
to
competition.
if
you
have
less
competitors,
if
one
is
put
out
of
the
market,
if
one
is
less
able
to
compete,
or
for
whatever
reason,
then
that
in
itself
weakens
competition
and
is
injury
to
competition
as
well
under
section
2(a)
of
the
act,
as
well
as
the
injury
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
if
you
prove
discrimination
that
is
sufficient
to
show
or
allow
a
jury
to
reach
the
inference
of
injury,
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
not
just...
for
instance
this
is
not
a
per
se,
this
is
not
an
automatic,
it's
got
to
be
sufficient
discrimination
to
permit
the
reasonable
inference.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
was
holding
in
morton
salt.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
am.
i'm
saying
it
both
ways.
there
is
adequate
evidence,
statistical
evidence
of
tight
profits,
testimony
of
lost
sales,
testimony
that
people
came
into
the
shop
and
were
shopping
competition
saying
that
they
couldn't
buy
at
payne
because
it
was
high,
or
wouldn't
buy
at
payne.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
do,
and
the
8th
circuit's,
and
the
7th
circuit's,
in
bargain
car
wash,
mr.
justice
white,
as
not
permitting...
or
not
saying
automatic
damage,
because
it
is,
there's
always
the
possibility
of
rebuttal
by
the
defendant
if
the
extraordinary
circumstances
this
court
talked
about
in
bruce's
juices
are
present.
for
instance,
if
there
is
such
an
inelastic
market
that
it
really
doesn't
matter--
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
--that
is
the
presumption...
the
presumptive
damage
rule
was
in
the
senate's
version
of
the
bill.
it
was
eliminated
in
conference
due
to
legislative
bargaining
without
comment.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
if
you
utilize
that
negative
inference
just
because
it
was
originally
in
there,
without
finding
out
the
real
reason
behind
why
it
was
eliminated,
then
you
totally
disregard
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
c.
lee
reeves
i
say
that
this
court
should
reaffirm
the
minimum
damage
rule
that
it
indicated
in
bruce's
juices
and
in
morton
salt
which
permits
an
inference
of
damage,
at
least
in
that
amount,
subject
to
rebuttal,
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
at
one
point
a
provision
of
presumptive
damages
does
not
mean
that
that,
the
elimination
of
it
by
congress
meant
that
congress
didn't
want
that
type
rule,
because
that
rule
was
redundant.
it
was
always
extant
under
the
clayton
act,
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
as
is
pointed
out
in
our
original
brief
and
reply
brief;
i
think
the
ladoga
decision
permitted
it.
thank
you.
