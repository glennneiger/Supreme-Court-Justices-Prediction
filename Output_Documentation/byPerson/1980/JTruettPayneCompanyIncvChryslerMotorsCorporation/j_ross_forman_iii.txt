mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
must
a
private
plaintiff
prove
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
recover
treble
damages
for
an
alleged
violation
of
section
2(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act?
the
5th
circuit
in
its
holding
in
applying
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
the
brunswick
decision
held
that
more
than
a
mere
threat
of
anti
competitive
injury
had
to
be
shown
to
entitle
recovery
of
treble
damages.
it
held
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
go
further
and
show
that
it
had
in
fact
suffered
antitrust
injury
as
a
result
in
this
case
of
the
sales
incentive
programs,
and
provide
some
useful
measure
of
the
amount
of
such
injury.
the
court
analyzed
what
the
robinson-patman
act
was
designed,
or
the
injury
it
was
designed
to
prevent,
and
held
that
in
order
to
prove
a
case
of
damages
the
petitioner,
or
the
plaintiff,
had
to
show
that
competitive
use
was
made
of
a
price
advantage
by
a
favored
competitor,
and
that
as
a
result
of
this
competitive
use
competition
was
injured
by
profits
being
drawn,
or
sales
being
drawn
from
the
injured
or
from--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--i
think
the
5th
circuit
said
they
had
not
decided
that
issue.
i
think
what
they
were
saying
was
that,
well,
he
really
had
to
go
further.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
there
was
not
causation.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
that
the
significance
is
that
to
show
the
substantive
violation
of
2(a)
you
only,
at
least
under
morton
salt
and
that
ftc
action,
you
only
have
to
show
a
reasonable
possibility
that
injury
might
result
from
a
price
discrimination.
the
court
said
at
that
showing,
even
if
such
a
showing
had
been
made
in
this
case,
that
that
was
not
significant
or
substantial
enough
to
allow
recovery
of
injury.
you
had
to
go
forward
and
show
that
the
injury
to
competition
had
in
fact
occurred
and
that
the
plaintiff
was
injured
because
of
this
injury.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
not
necessarily,
if
it
didn't
affect
the
competition,
it
if
was
no...
it
seems
to
me
there
may
not
have
been
competition
in
that
hypothetical,
but
i
say,
if
you--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
i
would
think
that
under
the
structure
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
there
probably
would
not
be
a
violation.
i
think
the
act
is
not
designed
to--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--i
think
it
would
not
be
under
2(a)
because
the
act
is
not
designed,
i
think,
to
insure
that
everybody
is
going
to
pay
the
same
unit
price
for
what
they
purchase.
i
think
the
act
is
only
there
to
remedy
a
situation
where
the
competition
between
the
favored
and
the
disfavored
dealer
is
disrupted
because
of
a
payment
of
a
lower
price.
but
some
competitive
use
has
to
be
made
by
the
favored
dealer.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
it
may
threaten
his
effectiveness,
but
until
something
actually
happens
i
don't
believe
he
has
a
cause
of
action.
plus,
i
think
in
this
case
he
would
have
to
go
ahead
and
prove
that
it
did
threaten
his
ability
to
compete.
i
know
mr.
reeves
used
the
example
that,
well,
if
he's
paying
more,
it
may
have
inhibited
his
ability
because
he
couldn't
lower
his
price
and
thereby
draw
more
sales,
and
so
forth.
that's
purely
hypothetical.
there's
no
proof
in
this
case
that
mr.
payne
would
have
lowered
his
price,
there's
no
proof
of
what
would
have
happened
if
he
had
lowered
the
price
of
his
cars,
whether
he
would
have
attracted
new
sales.
there's
no
evidence
as
to
what
profit
he
may
have
realized
if
he
had
done
that.
there's
simply
no
proof
in
this
case
that
he
did
suffer
any
antitrust
injury.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
to
himself.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
correct.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
then
you've
got
a
price
fixing
conspiracy.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
i
think
you
would
because
that
case
is
an
overcharge
case.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
price
discrimination--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--i
think
the
difference
is
in
the
design
of
the
two
acts.
in
the
overcharge
cases
it's
always
assumed
that
the
person
is
paying
more
than
the
competitive
price.
he's
paying
more
than
he
would
have
if
there
had
been
no
conspiracy.
if
there
was
no
conspiracy
he
would
have
paid
less.
in
a
price
discrimination
case...
and
this
is
a
good
example,
in
this
case,
when
mr.
payne
and
the
other
dealers
in
the
birmingham
area
purchased
their
cars,
they
were
paying
the
same
price,
there'd
be
no
violation
or
alleged
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
all
right,
only
when
a
car
is
later
sold
under
one
of
these
sales
incentive
programs
can
there
even
be
any
arguable
price
discrimination.
now,
if
there
had
been
no
incentive
programs
the
fellow
would
not
have
been
paying
a
lower
price,
mr.
payne
would
not
have
been
paying
a
lower
price
for
his
cars.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
so
if
chrysler
had
lowered
the--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
he'd
have
been
a
little
bit
better
off,
but
i
think
the
key
in
the
section
2(a)
case
is
how
much
worse
off
you
are
because
somebody
else
received
a
lower
price
than
you
did.
i
think
if
the
act
was
structured
purely
to
look
at
the
benefits
to
one
dealer,
it
probably
would
have
been
worded
differently.
you
probably
would
not
have
had
the
injury
to
competition.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
just
made
less
money
out
of
it.
i
would
think
you
have
not
really
shown
any
injury
to
competition
because
he's
paying
more.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
i
think
in
the
sherman
act
case
you
don't
have
to
show
any
competition.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
is
maybe
the
answer,
you
don't
have
to
show
that
mr.
payne
was
competing
with
anybody.
if
they
raised
the
price
by
fixing
it,
he
has
a
cause
of
action
there
but
by
the
robinson-patman
act
you've
got
to
have
two
sales.
you've
got
to
have
two
sales
to
compare,
and
somebody
has
to
have
received
a
lower
price
and
made
some
competitive
use
of
that
lower
price.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
there
is
in
terms
of
antitrust
injury,
which
is
the
injury
that
is
defined
in
brunswick
that
flows
from
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
violation.
and
i
think
you
could
perhaps
look
at
the
reasoning
behind
the
enactment
of
robinson-patman,
and
what
was
congress
trying
to
do?
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
they
were
trying
to
prevent
an
underselling.
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
the
growth
of
the
chain
stores
at
the
expense
of
the
independent
retailer.
they
were
concerned
about
their
ability
to
undersell
the
independent
retailer
and
draw
sales
from
the
independent
retailer
or
draw
profits
if
the
fellow
tried
to
compete,
match
that
competition.
now,
if
they
designed
the
robinson-patman
act,
i
think,
to
remedy
that
situation
where
profits
were
being
drawn
away
from
the
disfavored
competitor.
and
i
think
that
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
when
reading
this
statute.
they
were
not
concerned
necessarily
with
fixing
a
uniform
price.
i
think
that's
important
also.
congress
only
wanted
to
remedy
a
situation
where
there
had
been
or
possibly
would
be
competitive
injury.
and
under
brunswick
you
had
to
go
forward
and
prove
that
there
was
in
fact
competitive
injury
to
be
entitled
to
recover.
plaintiff's
reliance
on
morton
salt
does
not
help
him
in
this
case,
because
that
was
not
a
damage
case.
section
4
of
the
act
was
not
involved
in
any
manner.
all
the
court
held
there
was
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
allow
the
ftc
to
infer
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
there
might
be
injury
to
competition.
it
is
true
that
the
morton
salt
case
showed,
or
said,
you
didn't
necessarily
have
to
show
injury
to
competition
or
that
competitive
use
was
actually
made
of
the
price
advantage.
however,
that
case
is
not
applicable
because
brunswick
has
held
that
you've
got
to
go
further
than
that.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
it
would
bar
him
proceeding.
but
there
you're
not
concerned
with
treble
damages.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
there's
an
awful
difference
between
an
injunctive
action
to
prevent
future
violations,
or
even
future
injury,
than
in
a
treble
damage
case
where
you
actually
are
recovering
substantial
amounts
of
damage.
and
to
do
that
you've
got
to
prove
that
you
were
in
fact
damaged.
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
there.
petitioner
has
stated
in
his
argument
that
there
was
substantial
proof,
corroborating
proof
of
antitrust
injury
in
this
case.
he
talked
about
underselling,
proof
of
underselling
by
the
other
competitors,
he
talked
about
lost
sales,
he
talked
about
forcing
business...
mr.
payne
was
forcing
business,
he
talked
about
having
to
overallow
on
used
cars.
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
to
substantiate
those
accusations
are
mr.
payne's
bare
allegations
to
that
effect.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
and
i
would
suggest
that
he
had
to
go
forward
and
show
that
he
lost
sales.
to
prove
you
lost
sales
is
something
that's
done
every
day
in
antitrust.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
he'd
have
a
number,
then,
to
give
you,
but
he's
submitted
no
number
here
of
the
number
of
automobiles--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
i
think
he
should
have
something--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--i
would
submit
that
you
probably
do.
you
should
have
some
evidence
there
to
corroborate
what
he
says.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
because
if
you
don't,
i
don't
think
you
have
any
protection
for
the
defendant.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
don't
see
how.
this
case,
of
what
that
damage
was;
unless
he
shows
some
lost
sales
or
some
measure
of
it.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
he
said,
i
would
have
made
$80,000
in
profit?
i
would
hope
he
could
substantiate
that
by
some
records.
i
think
that's
the
only
protection
a
defendant
has.
otherwise
the
plaintiff
could
say
anything.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
you
have
to
prove
it
with
some
evidence,
some
statistical
evidence.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
it
isn't
evidence
because
there
is
not
enough
there
to
protect
a
defendant.
he
is
free
to
say
anything
he
wants
to
say,
and
unless...
where
you're
attempting
to
recover
treble
damages,
you
ought
to
have
to
really
prove
what
in
effect
you're
saying.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
it's
insufficient
evidence
to
substantiate
the
verdict.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
he
has
to
have
some
substance
behind
it.
i
think
if
he's
got
some
way
to
correlate
what
he
says--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--correct.
he's
saying
nothing
other
than
what
he
says
in
his
complaint,
really,
is
a
complaint
enough
to
establish
a
case?
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
you
may
have
the
best
evidence
rule
there
would
be
applicable,
to
show
the
bills
rather
than
showing
his
pure
testimony
of
what
he
claims
he
paid.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
provided
you
didn't
object
on
best
evidence,
or
demanding
best
evidence.
i
think
there
the
bills
would
be
the
best
evidence.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
he
might
in
that
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
he
didn't
produce
any
records
other
than
his
financial
statements
which
were
submitted
to
chrysler.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
parts
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
think
we
demanded
all
the
documents
that
he
had.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
at
trial
we
didn't.
it
turned
out
we
didn't
get
them
all,
but--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
it
was
not...
no,
he
overruled
us,
your
honor.
he
allowed
that
document
into
evidence
which
is
one
of
our,
another
grounds
on
appeal
in
this
case.
but
it
says
to
me
basically
that
if
mr.
payne
can
merely
say
without
even
giving
any
figures
of
any
kind
that
he
was
undersold
by
his
competitors,
that
he
lost
sales,
that
he
forced
business,
that
he
overallowed
on
used
cars,
well,
you
can
just
read
in
his
complaint,
and
that
would
substantiate
a
finding.
in
fact,
i
think
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
he
didn't
overallow,
that
he
didn't
force
business,
and
he
didn't
lose
sales.
and
i
think
that's
borne
out
by
the
statistical
evidence
that
i
have
on
page
8
of
my
brief...
page
10;
i'm
sorry,
a
chart
that
compares
the
sales
of
the
various
dealers,
compares
the
gross
profits
of
the
various
dealers.
there
mr.
payne
was
realizing
the
highest
average
gross
profit
of
any
of
the
dealers,
of
the
four
dealers,
with
whom
he
alleged
he
competed.
that
certainly
is
not
evidence
of
him
having
to
force
business,
plus
it
appears
that
his--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
he
claimed
in
his
brief
that,
every
sale,
there
was
a
discrimination.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
it
did
vary
among
styles.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
he
determined
that
on
about
whether
he
was
the
most
favored
dealer,
is
what
it
boils
down
to.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
an
important
issue
or
point
in
this
case,
is
that
under
these
programs
there
was
no
one
favored
dealer.
the
programs
lasted
only
some
three
months
at
a
time,
and
who
was
the
favored
dealer
varied
between
all
four
of
them,
including
mr.
payne.
and
i
think
the...
if
i
can
make
reference
to
the
joint
appendix,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
271
which
shows
the
average
difference
per
unit
over
a
three
year
period
that
was
realized
by
the
incentive
payments.
the
difference
worked
out
to
be
only
$11
among
the
most
favored,
so
called
most
favored
dealer,
which
was
central,
and
the
least
favored,
who
was
roebuck,
$51
per
car.
i
think
that
shows
the
inherent
fairness
of
these
programs,
how
everything
did
tend
to
equalize
out
and
that
there
would
not
have
been
any
competitive
injury.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
i
think
he
also
has
to
show
that
there
was
in
fact
actual
competitive
injury,
and
that--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
he
claimed...
the
violation
had
to
occur
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
right,
but
the
violation
had
to
occur
prior
to
him
going
out
of
business.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
i
think
there's
also
evidence
in
the
case
that
the
reason
that...
and
i
think
this
average
gross
profit
on
the
retail
sales
demonstrates
that
his
new
car
sales
was
not
hurting.
he
was
realizing
the
best
profit
of
any
of
the
dealers
on
the
new
car
sales,
and
that's
the
area
where
the
sales
incentive
programs
would
have
affected
him.
what
his
problem
was
as
demonstrated
by
the
statistical
evidence
in
here,
is
in
his
used
car
operation.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
they
cover
his
sales
for
the
entire
year,
but
as
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
indicated,
i
think,
on
footnote
3
of
his
brief,
he
says,
"it
is
obvious
that
there
were
rebates
paid
on
almost
every
single
car
sold
at
retail
by
the
various
dealers.
"
i
submit
in
that
instance
that
the
averaging
is
a
fair
way
to
look
at
it.
in
fact,
he
tried
to
make
use
of
averaging
in
his
brief
when
he
tried
to
show
a
tight
profit
margin.
he
averaged
the
profits
over
an
entire
year.
and
if
he
should
have
broken
that
down
by
the
sales
incentive
programs,
if
we
should
have,
he
should
have
also.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
it
shows
that
his
used
cars
was
low
and
that's
on
page
269.
however,
mr.
payne
himself...
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
to
relate
that
low
used
car
profit
to
these
sales
incentive
programs.
mr.
payne
indicated
that
the
reason
for
that
low
profit
was
that
he
was
forced
to
wholesale
his
used
cars.
and
that
was
the
reason
for
low
profit.
and
i
think
that
mr.
payne's
testimony
there
certainly
ought
to
make
that
point
clear,
or
certainly
require
him
to
come
forward
and
show
some
actual
transaction
where
he
actually
did
overallow
on
a
used
car,
if
in
fact
he
ever
did.
that's
really
evidence
that
chrysler
can't
produce,
whether
he
overallowed.
that's
something
that's
in
his
peculiar
knowledge,
that's
something
that
he
has
to--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--i
would
think
he'd
have
to
come
forward
with
some
documents
to
show,
and
there
shouldn't
be--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
if
it's
within
the
company,
it
certainly
is,
within
his
accountant...
they
certainly
could
have
shown
a
transaction
and
said,
look,
this
car,
we
overvalued
it,
at
this
price.
and
in
fact
there's
no
way
you
can
say
from
these
used
car
profits,
or
let
me
say
it
this
way,
to
show
an
overallowance.
you
would
have
had
to
have
some
testimony
as
to
what
value
they
entered
the
used
cars
on
their
books
at,
whether
it
was
at
the
inflated
value,
or
whether
it
was
at
the
retail
value.
there
was
no
evidence
to
that
effect,
no
showing
to
that
effect.
and
i
might
go
on
to
show,
even
if
this
court
should
feel
that
there
was
some
proof
of
an
antitrust
injury,
that
the
plaintiff
still
is
not
entitled
to
recover,
because
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
amount
of
that
injury.
the
plaintiff's
case
rests
entirely
on
this
court
allowing
price
discrimination
to
be
the
proper
measure
of
damage.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
there
was
a
verdict,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
we
did
object
to
some
instruction.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
the
5th
circuit
didn't
reach
that
issue.
there
were
several
issues
raised
before
the
5th
circuit
which
were
not
decided
by
the
court
because
they
decided
on
failure
to
prove
antitrust
injury.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
that
was
submitted,
which
is
evident
from
a
review
of
the
record,
is
this
mathematical
calculation
of
what
they
considered
was
the
price
discrimination.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
they
would
have
had
to,
your
honor,
because
there
was
no
other
evidence.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
we
did
object
to
some
instructions,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
i
don't
think
we
did--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--we
did
not
on
the
math
because
he
said
that
the
price
discrimination
is
not
a
proper
measure.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
that's
our
point,
here,
that
there
wasn't
any.
the
only
thing
they
could
have
based
it
on
was
the
price
discrimination,
that's
what
the
plaintiff
argued
in
his
closing
argument.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
but
those...
they
allow
some
reasonable
means
of
reflecting
the
antitrust
injury.
here
there
is
no...
they
didn't
reflect
any
lost
sales
or
the
amount
of
any
overallowance
or
the
amount
of
profits
that
were
drawn
from
him
in
forcing
business.
he
merely
said,
here's
a
mathematical
calculation,
this
is
the
price
discrimination,
and
we
should
be
entitled
to
it.
in
fact,
i
think
the--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--that's
right,
but
he
offered
no
showing
of
what
the
profit
would
have
been
in
a
normal
everyday--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--he
stated
purely--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--he
said
we
lost--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--but
there
was
no
measure
of
what
the
profits
would
have
been
from
losing
those
lost
sales.
there
was
no
measure
whatsoever,
there
was
no
number
of
lost
sales.
there
is
no
way
they
could
have
determined
the
amount
of
the
damage.
in
fact,
i
think
the
very
way
they
computed
the
price
discrimination
in
this
case
shows
that
it
couldn't
reflect
any
antitrust
injury.
what
they
did
was
simply
divide
the
number
of
cars
they
sold
during
a
program
period
into
the
amount
of
money
that
was
received
by
the
dealer.
when
mr.
payne
didn't
receive
the
highest
per
unit
rebate
he
took
the
difference
between
what
the
highest
dealer
received
and
what
he
received,
and
multiplied
that
by
the
number
of
cars
that
he
was
selling.
in
that
instance,
he
stated
he
was
injured
more
by
the
more
cars
he
sold,
not
by
the
less
cars.
i
say
that
no
way
that
type
evidence
is
reflective
of
any
antitrust
injury.
in
fact,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
were
to
overrule
or
reverse
the
5th
circuit,
you
would
in
fact
be
adopting
the
automatic
damage
rule
which
i
thought
the
plaintiff
was
advocating;
at
least
i
thought
he
was
in
his
initial
brief.
it
would
be
absolutely
no
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
a
robinson-patman
act.
all
he'd
have
to
do
is
to
by
some
mathematical
calculation
to
show
a
price
difference,
come
in
and
say,
these
are
my
competitors.
they
allowed,
because
of
this
price
difference,
they
could
undersell
me,
i
lost
business,
i
overallowed
on
used
cars.
here
is
the
difference.
award
that
to
me.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
he
did
not,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--no,
your
honor,
he
didn't,
but
there
wasn't
any,
that's
the
point.
i
think
review
of
the
record,
he
was
in
error.
and
that's
what
the
5th
circuit
found
after
reviewing
his
transcript.
they
found
no
supporting
evidence
to
support
the--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--correct.
for
they
had
to
say
that
was
not
sufficient
evidence--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--i
would
hope,
without
arguing...
this
is
evidence
that
they
could
indeed...
he
should
have
been
able
to
produce
them.
this
plaintiff
is
asking
for
treble
damages.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
well,
then,
you
will
come
to
the
measure
of,
did
he--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--well,
then
i
think
you
can
tell
them
that
he
provide
a
reasonable
measure
of
the
amount
of
his
injury.
he
didn't.
he
relied
purely
on
the
amount
of
price
discrimination,
which
congress...
they
have
considered
that
matter,
and
they
simply
rejected
it
when
they
adopted
the
robinson-patman
act,
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
some
detail.
and
i
think,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statutory
offense
like
this,
this
court
must
consider
what
congress
did,
and
if
congress
rejected
that
remedy,
this
court
should
not
come
forward
and
provide
such
a
remedy.
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
he
did,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
j.
ross
forman,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
said
it
was
not
the
measure
of
damage,
but
the...
as
the
5th
circuit
said,
there
wasn't
any
other
evidence
in
the
case.
thank
you.
