justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
concede
that
findings
of
discrimination
under
the
act,
without
any
evidence
sufficient
to
survive
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
dealing
with
causation
and
damage,
would
be
insufficient
to
support
a
monetary
award?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
mr.
payne's
testimony
itself
without
the
testimony
of
dr.
ignatin
would
have
required
the
district
court
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
damages
and
required
it
to
accept
an
award
of
damages
that
was
within
the
range
of
his
testimony?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
have
only
these
two
questions
on
the
damage
issue,
and
they're
put
to
mr.
payne
by
mr.
payne's
counsel,
"mr.
payne,
were
you
damaged
by
this
price
discrimination?
"
answer:
"yes".
question:
"how
much"?

is
that
submissible
to
the
jury
on
the
damage
issue
and
sustainable?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
all
of
the
bruce's
juices
language
on
page

330
u.s.,
where
the
court
says
that
the
plaintiff
here
is
not
complaining
of
the
high
price
of
the
object
sold,
but
it's
complaining
that
he
didn't
get
enough
of
what
he
wanted,
in
effect?
in
other
words,
that
to
analogize
to
your
case
in
my
mind
at
any
rate
you're
complaining
not
of
the
discount
and
rebates
as
such
but
that
other
people
got
more
of
them
than
your
client?
justice
rehnquist
in
bruce's
juices,
on
page
746
the
court
is
discussing
the
refusal
to
outlaw
these
discounts
flatly,
and
it
says,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
"they
become
illegal
only
under
certain
conditions
and
when
they
are
illegal
it
is
as
much
a
violation
to
accept
or
receive
as
to
allow
them.
"
"bruce,
in
one
of
the
years
included
in
its
balance
of
account,
purchased
more
than
a
half
million
dollars
of
cans
on
which
it
received
precisely
the
kind
and
amount
of
discount
that
now
it
asserts
to
be
illegal.
"
isn't
that
to
a
certain
extent
true
of
your
client?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
his
testimony
evidence?
justice
rehnquist
conclusory
is
something
that
one
usually
hears
applied
to
pleadings
rather
than
evidence.
suppose
in
a
personal
injury
action,
a
plaintiff
gets
on
the
stand
and
says,
i
paid
out
of
pocket
$2,500
in
medical
bills,
and
he's
not
cross
examined
about
it
and
it's
a
bench
trial
and
the
judge
makes
a
finding
of
fact,
the
plaintiff
paid
out
of
pocket
$2,500
in
medical
bills.
the
plaintiff
has
never
produced
a
single
bill.
justice
rehnquist
--do
you
say
that
the
jury's
rendition
of
a
money
judgment
for
you
is
inconsistent
with
the
doctrines
of
rko
v.
bigelow,
and
story
parchment
where
you're
talking
about
business
damages
and
their
inherent
difficulty
of
proof?
justice
rehnquist
so
that
if
you
prove
discrimination,
you're
entitled
to
damages?
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
the
congressional
history,
where
they
had
a
presumptive
damage
provision
and
they
eliminated
it
during
the
course
of
enacting
the
robinson-patman
act?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
there
is
a
presumption
of
damage?
