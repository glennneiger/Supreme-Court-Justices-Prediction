what
records,
if
any,
did
mr.
payne
produce?
justice
jr.
did
you
demand
any
records,
any
of
the
records
you
are
now
talking
about?
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
jr.
well,
did
counsel
for
chrysler
demand--
justice
jr.
--and
how
did
the
court
rule
on
that?
justice
jr.
did
the
trial
court
sustain
your
request
that
all
documents
be
produced?
justice
jr.
mr.
reeves,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
the
outset?
in
the
summary
of
your
argument,
the
first
sentence
states,
"the
plaintiff
in
a
private
price
discrimination
action
must
only
prove
sufficient
price
discrimination
from
which
a
jury
can
infer
injury
to
competition.
"
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
opinion,
as
i
read
it,
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
you
were
arguing
and
relying
on
the
automatic
damage
concept.
have
you
changed
your
position
on
that?
