justice
stevens
mr.
reeves,
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
of
injury
to
competition
other
than
the
injury
to
your
client?
justice
stevens
he
testified
that
the
market
price
as
a
whole
was
raised
by
reason
of
the
discrimination?
justice
stevens
but
that's
only
corroborating
if
you
assume
that
he
went
out
of
business
because
of
the
price
discrimination.
that's
the
allegation
that
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with.
justice
stevens
is
this
much
true,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
believing
there
was
a
violation,
or
at
least
assuming
there
was
a
violation,
it
must
have
assumed
that
at
least
some
of
the
expert's
testimony
was
truthful,
at
least
the
part
about
raising
prices?
if
it
disregarded
all
the
testimony
about
hurting
your
client,
because
injury
to
competition
is
an
ingredient
of
a
statutory
violation,
so
they
apparently
believed
part
of
what...
were
willing
to
assume
that
part
of
his
testimony
was
credible
and
part
may
not
have
been.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
forman,
supposing
that
the
two
dealers
handled
both
the
chrysler
cars
and
also
general
motors
cars,
and
general
motors
and
chrysler
agreed
to
charge
a
higher
price
to
one
than
the
other.
and
they
did
that,
and
they
nevertheless
continued
to
sell
500
cars
apiece.
would
there
be
any
violation
of
law?
justice
stevens
you've
got
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
would
you
have
any
injury
to
either
one
of
them?
justice
stevens
what
assurance...
whether
you
call
it
an
overcharge
or
price
discrimination,
how
does
it
differ
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
the
person
who
makes
less
money
than
if
the
illegality
had
not
been
present?
justice
stevens
well,
how
can
you
say
that?
if
there
had
been
no
incentive
programs,
maybe
we
would
just
would
have
had
a
uniform
price
reduction
to
both.
instead
of
charging
initially
a
higher
price
followed
by
rebate,
you
might
start
out
with
a
lower
net
price
in
the
first
instance
to
avoid
the
violation.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
instead
of
initially
charging
$5,000
and
later
rebating
$500,
you
might
initially
just
charge
$4,500.
that
would
be...
and
if
you
did
that,
instead
of
having
a
rebate
program,
i
suppose
that
the
disfavored
purchaser
would
have
been
better
off.
justice
stevens
would
the
case
be
different
if
instead
of
a
rebate
you
originally
had
a
list
price
of
$4,500
and
then
without
announcing
it
publicly
they
wrote
a
letter
to
payne
that
said
that
we've
decided
to
charge
you
$5,000
a
car
from
now
on,
and
they
just
raised
the
price
to
payne
without...
payne
never
did
know
what
his
competitors
were
getting,
anything
like
that?
secretly,
he
had
to
pay
a
higher
price.
would
he
have
a
cause
of
action?
he
still
sold
the
same
amount
of
cars,
just
made
less
money
on
each
one.
justice
stevens
but
if
they
raised
the
price
by
agreeing
with
their
competitor
to
do
it,
why
then,
of
course
he
would
have
an
injury?
and
in
the
first
case
there
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
basic
substantive
statute.
in
the
second
case
there
would
be,
because
you'd
have
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices,
which
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
in
each
case
there
might
be
proof
of
injury.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
the
argument
how
one
may
be
a
violation
of
law
and
the
other
is
not.
i'm
just...
because
this
case
turns
on
whether
there
is
an
injury
to
the
plaintiff.
i'm
just
questioning
in
terms
of
injury
to
the
plaintiff,
is
there
really
a
difference,
a
meaningful
difference
between
the
two
cases?
justice
stevens
but
it
is
applicable
to
suggest
that
my
hypothetical,
or
maybe
justice
white's
hypothetical,
that
sales
to
two
different
prices,
where
there
is
no
transfer
of
business
back
and
forth,
would
violate
the
robinson-patman
act
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
commission?
justice
stevens
do
those
figures
relate
to
the
models
on
which
he
claimed
there
was
a
price
discrimination?
justice
stevens
i
understand
him
to
say
there
was
a
price
discrimination
on
some
at
some
periods
of
time,
and
some
models,
but
not
constantly?
justice
stevens
and
i
thought
he
said
some
of
the
rebate
programs
were
lawful
and
some
were
unlawful?
justice
stevens
of
course,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
violation,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
he
did
go
out
of
business,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
that's
a
fact
that's
consistent,
at
least,
with
his
testimony,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
right,
but
the
fact
that
he
did
not
survive
in
the
competitive
market
is
consistent
with
his
theory
that
he
suffered
some
harm
that
caused
him
some--
justice
stevens
--i
still
am
not
sure
you
answered
my
question,
whether
those
profit
margins
on
the
new
car
sales
on
page
10
of
your
brief
related
to
the
models
and
the
periods
of
time
when
the
price
discrimination
claimed
to
be
illegal
was
in
effect?
or
do
they
cover
his
sales?
justice
stevens
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
used
car
business
and
how
much
they
made
on
over
allowances,
or
something
like
that,
on
each
used
car
transaction.
is
there
record
evidence
supporting
his
arguments
on
that?
justice
stevens
if
it's
within
his
peculiar
knowledge
and
he
gives
testimony
that's
based
on
his
peculiar
knowledge
would
that
be
sufficient
to
support
a
conclusion
on
the
testimony?
justice
stevens
if
there's
documents,
then
it's
just
not
within
his
peculiar
knowledge.
then
you're
saying
it's
available?
justice
stevens
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
remedy
too
didn't
he,
in
his
instructions?
justice
stevens
he
gave
the
instruction
on
that
precise
point
that
you
wanted?
