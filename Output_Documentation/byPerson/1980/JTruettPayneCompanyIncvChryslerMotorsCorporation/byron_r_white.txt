justice
white
well,
what
about
price
discrimination
plus
the
fact
that
the
two
customers
are
competitive?
is
that
enough?
justice
white
well,
i
wouldn't
think
you
would;
yes.
justice
white
well,
counsel,
suppose
before
a
discrimination
takes
place,
two
competitors
are
each
selling
500
cars
a
year
and
then
the
manufacturer
lowers
the
price
to
one
of
the
dealers
but
not
to
the
other.
afterwards,
they
are
both
selling
500
cars
a
year,
and
the
only
thing
that's
happened
is
that
the
disfavored
dealer
is
not
making
the
same
profit
as
his
competitor,
and
he
has
lost
profits,
but
he
hasn't
lost
any
sales.
he's
lost
profits.
now
is
that
enough
to
give
rise
to
injury?
justice
white
well,
is
that
an
injury
to
competition?
justice
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
here
assume
an
injury
to
competition
but
then
just
say,
the
injury
to
competition,
there's
no
proof
that
it
caused
any
injury
to
your
client?
justice
white
so
it
necessarily
said
that
even
if
there
was
a
violation
there
was
not
causation.
justice
white
well,
if...
why
didn't
you
just
take
the...
if
you
really
are
prepared
to
support
your
answer
to
my
question
of
a
while
ago,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
whether
your
client
lost
sales
in
this
case
or
not,
he
paid
more
for
his
cars,
and
therefore
he
lost
some
profits.
justice
white
that's
all
you
have
to
say.
justice
white
well,
but
they
didn't.
they
said
that--
justice
white
--well,
my
example
to
you,
though,
the
500-car
example,
the
disfavored
dealer
is
making
the
same
profit,
after
the
discrimination.
he
just
isn't
making
the
profit
his
competitor
is.
can
you
say
he
lost
profits?
justice
white
the
fact
is,
though,
that
after
the
discrimination,
in
my
example,
the
favored
dealer
didn't
pick
up
any
sales.
justice
white
that
may
be
so
to
show
a
violation.
justice
white
but
you
don't...
doesn't
a
treble
damage
claimant
have
to
prove
an
actual
injury
to
competition?
justice
white
that
is,
you
say
even
if
it
were
found
that
there
actually
was
not,
or
even
if...
you
could
say,
even
though
there's
no
proof
of
actual
injury
to
competition,
the
plaintiff
could
recover?
justice
white
well,
don't
you
think
we
have
to
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
white
yes;
even
if
there
was.
so
there
wasn't
causation?
justice
white
however,
there
was
an
injury.
justice
white
well,
what
about
in
my
example
of
the
two
dealers
with
each
selling
500
cars?
suppose
i
vary
that.
each
of
them
is
selling
500
cars
before
a
discrimination
takes
place.
and
then
the
manufacturer
raises
the
price
to
the
disfavored
dealer,
keeps
the
price
the
same
to
the
favored
dealer,
and
afterwards
they
both
sell
exactly
the
same
number
of
cars;
the
only
thing
is,
the
disfavored
dealer
isn't
making
the
same
unit
profit,
net
profit,
that
he
was
before.
is
that
proof
of
injury
to
his
business?
justice
white
well,
they
were
both
competing
with
one
another.
i
certainly
will
put
that
in,
in
it.
but
the
only
thing
that
happens,
they
both
sell
the
same
number
of
cars
afterwards,
but
the
disfavored
dealer
isn't
making...
he's
just
lost
profits,
that's
all.
justice
white
there
would
not
be
injury,
you
think,
or
what?
justice
white
but
if
his...
the
lowering
of
his
profits
certainly
makes
him
less
effective,
threatens
his
effectiveness
as
a
competitor?
justice
white
well,
you
can
say
that
they're
just
bare
allegations
but
he
did
say
he
lost
sales.
justice
white
well,
he
says,
i
own
the
business,
i
know
how
many
cars
i've
been
selling
lately,
and
i
know
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
sell
as
many
cars
as
i
used
to.
justice
white
well,
if
he
had
just
said,
by
the
way,
and
what
i
mean
is,
i
lost
20
sales.
that
would
be
enough?
justice
white
or
does
he...
should
he
have
to
call
an
accountant
and
get
out
his
records,
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
white
well,
why
do
you
need
corroboration?
you
need
corroboration
in
some
rare
kinds
of
cases
but--
justice
white
--well,
the
court
could
say,
i
just
don't
believe
you.
but
are
you
going
to
say,
well,
we
believe
you,
but
you
need
some
corroboration,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
court
believes
him,
that
he
did
lose
sales?
could
they
give
judgment?
justice
white
well,
he
says,
i
lost
sales
in
the
amount
of
$80,000,
out
of
which
i
could
have
have
made
$80,000
in
profit.
is
that
enough?
justice
white
well,
if
the
judge
were
to
say
to
him,
i
believe
you
all
right,
but
you
have
to
prove
it
with
some
papers?
is
that
what
you
suggest?
justice
white
even
though
you
may
believe
him?
justice
white
was
there
a
verdict
in
this
case?
justice
white
and
did
you
object
to
any
of
the
instructions?
justice
white
of
course,
you
don't
argue
now
that
there
are
any
instructional
problems?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
the
jury
must
have
decided
not
only
that
there
was
proof
of
injury
but
they
knew
how
much
it
was?
justice
white
well,
you
think
the
jury
departed
from
its
instructions?
justice
white
but
you
don't
complain
about
the
instructions
about
causation
and
the
fact
of
injury
and
the
amount?
the
instructions
are
all
right
in
that
regard?
justice
white
on
those
particular
ones
or
not?
justice
white
in
any
event,
the
jury
did
not--
justice
white
--but
the
jury
certainly
thought
there
was
some
evidence
of...
i
know
you
say
there
wasn't,
but--
justice
white
well,
he
went
on,
then.
you
agree
he
went
on
and
said,
and
said
that
he
lost
sales.
justice
white
yes,
i
know,
but
he
testified
as
to
that,
didn't
he?
justice
white
didn't
he
testify
in
court
on
that?
justice
white
and
the
jury
must
have
believed
him.
or
they
could
have.
justice
white
didn't
you...
i
suppose
you
asked
the
judge
not
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury,
give
the
case
to
the
jury
at
all?
justice
white
and
after
verdict
you
asked
for
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict?
justice
white
and
the
judge
disagreed
with
you?
justice
white
so
he
didn't
buy
your
argument
of
no
evidence?
justice
white
and
he
didn't
buy
your
argument
there
wasn't
evidence
about
amount?
justice
white
i
know,
but
they
had
to
do
away
with
his
own
testimony
as
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
anything.
justice
white
what
if
they
were
wrong
on
that?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that?
what
if
we
say,
well,
that
was
evidence,
and
if
the...
and...
it
was
entitled
to
be
credited
by
the
judge
or
the
jury.
then
what?
justice
white
i
know
you
think
we'd
be
wrong,
but
what
should
we
do
if
we
are
so
grossly
erroneous?
justice
white
well,
are
you
saying
that
even
if
this
owner
hadn't
got
on
the
stand
and
said
he
lost
sales
or
profits,
that
you
should
win?
justice
white
would
you
defend
the
9th
circuit's
view
of
the
robinson-patman
act?
