justice
stewart
it
began
its
opinion
by
saying
that
it
didn't
need
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
justice
stewart
and
if
there
had
been
a
violation
of
it...
but
i
guess
it
proceeded
to
assume
that
there
had
been
one,
and
if
there
had
been
one,
then
there
was
an
injury
to
competition.
justice
stewart
i
see.
well,
and
the
very
fact
that
your
client
went
out
of
business
resulting
in
three
competitors
for
selling
chrysler-plymouths
instead
of
four
would
be
an
injury
to
competition,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
therefore,
in
answer
to
my
brother
white's
question,
your
answer
would
be
that
in
his
hypothetical
case
there
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
because
there
would
not
be
injury
to
competition,
since
each
dealer
continued
to
sell
the
same
number
of
cars
as
he
had
in
the
past.
justice
stewart
therefore,
you
wouldn't
get
to
the
next
step
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
had
shown
injury?
justice
stewart
because
there
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
stewart
first
of
all,
you
have
to
show
a
violation
of
the
law.
justice
stewart
well,
you're
not
saying
it's
not
evidence,
you're
saying
it's
insufficient
evidence?
