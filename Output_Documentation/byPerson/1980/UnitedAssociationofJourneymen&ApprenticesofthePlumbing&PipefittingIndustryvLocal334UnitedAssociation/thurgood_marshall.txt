within
the

you
might
wait
till
the
end;
you
might
not
agree.
within
the
meaning
of
301,
that's
my
question?
justice
marshall
my
question
was,
within
301,
which
you
and
i
both
understand
is
not
state
law?
justice
marshall
what
kind
of
contract
do
you
think
they
meant?
justice
marshall
any
legislative
history
to
help
you
that
you
haven't
mentioned?
but
i
mean,
is
there
any
that
you
didn't
mention?
justice
marshall
what
says
that
this
is
not
a
contract?
justice
marshall
a
little
jump
there,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
well,
if
it's
not
a
contract,
what
is
it?
an
agreement?
justice
marshall
oh,
it
is.
justice
marshall
what
is
a
contract--
justice
marshall
--in
other
words,
your
whole
position
is
it
should
be
governed
by
state
law
in
a
state
court
and
not
the
federal
courts?
justice
marshall
that's
your
problem.
