justice

well,
there
is
that
other
view
that
the
union
constitution
shouldn't
ever
be
within
this.
justice
white
that
would
make
it
simple
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
mr.
gold,
do
you
have
any
examples
in
301
cases
of
borrowing
state
law
with
the
result
that
you
do
not
have
uniform
rule?
justice
white
so
you
would
suggest...
you
don't
suggest
that
as
an
ironclad
rule
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
301
and
of
lincoln
mills
was
to
end
up
with
a
uniform
federal
rule
in
every
contracts
case?
justice
white
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
its
history
to
say
that
in
the
proper
cases
you
could
borrow?
justice
white
if
there's
no
grievance
procedure
provided
in
the
contract,
he
can
certainly
sue.
justice
white
yes,
yes.
but
if
there's
a
grievance
procedure
he
must
follow
it.
justice
white
but
not
without
that
allegation.
justice
white
--yes,
but
it
can
be
after
it
gets
in
the
federal
court.
and
you
wouldn't
say,
if
the
case
was
filed
there
initially,
that
you
would
determine
jurisdiction
solely
on
the
face
of
the
complaint?
you'd
either
have
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
and
there
would
be
a
hearing,
and
similarly
after
removal.
justice
white
all
right.
that
may
be
so.
how
about
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
justice
white
but
if
this
suit
had
been
filed
in
the
federal
court
in
the
first
instance
and
there
had
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
section
301
did
not
provide
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
there
would
have
been
an
argument
on
the
law.
and
if
the
district
court
agreed,
it
would
have
been
dismissed.
justice
white
and
that
wouldn't
necessarily...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wouldn't
be
a
hearing
on
the
merits?
justice
white
and
your
position
is,
it
should
be
yes?
