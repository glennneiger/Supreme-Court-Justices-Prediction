mr.
john
axelrod
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
apparent
seriousness,
the
united
association
asked
this
court
to
literally
interpret
the
provision
in
section
301
which
provides
jurisdiction
for
suits
upon
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
beginning
at
least
in
1819
with
the
dartmouth
college
case
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
meaning
of
contract
is
not
clear
and
that
the
word
contract
cannot
be
literally
construed.
in
lion
dry
goods,
where
this
court
for
the
first
time
discussed
the
definition
of
the
word
contract
in
section
301,
the
court
again
said
the
definition
is
not
without
ambiguity.
in
sidell
the
7th
circuit
in
a
case
similar
to
this
again
said,
this
issue
is
not
without
ambiguity.
but
assuming
that
this
court
will
choose
to
interpret
the
statute
literally
and
to
conclude
that
any
dispute
between
a
local
union
and
a
national
union
is
a
contract
between
labor
organizations,
this
court
will
then
direct
federal
courts
to
supervise
the
most
mundane
relationships
between
local
union
and
parent
and
member.
for
example,
a
constitutional
provision
requires
a
two
thirds
vote
at
a
convention
prior
to
the
raising
of
dues.
at
the
constitutional
convention
the
presiding
officer
says
he
will
take
a
standing
vote,
and
he
determines
on
the
basis
of
this
standing
vote
that
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
delegates
to
the
convention
favor
the
dues
increase.
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
presiding
officer's
count
and
that
dispute
is
then
sued
upon
in
federal
court.
writing
for
the
7th
circuit
in
rota
v.
brac,
mr.
justice
stevens
said
that
that
would
not
be
a
federal
issue,
that
that
was
only
a
state
law
issue.
more
recently,
in
new
york
state,
there
was
a
state
court
action
to
determine
whether
a
bylaw
committee
had
the
authority
to
table
a
proposed
amendment
which
would
require
the
use
of
voting
machines.
that
was
a
state
law
at
issue
which
united
association
would
now
have
raised
to
the
level
of
a
federal
issue.
a
member
of
one
local
union
desires
to
transfer
to
another
local
union
and
the
local
union
that
he
seeks
to
join
says,
no.
the
member
claims
that
is
a
violation
of
his
right
to
transfer
between
local
unions,
a
right
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
his
local
union.
in
vincent
v.
plumbers
the
united
association
here
argued
that
that
was
not
a
federal
issue,
that
was
a
state
issue.
mr.
john
axelrod
the
statute
does
not
say
lawsuits
between
labor
organizations,
it
says
suits
on
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
mr.
john
axelrod
in
smith
v.
evening
news
this
court
said
that
the
word
"between"
modifies
suits
rather
than
contracts.
mr.
john
axelrod
and
since
smith
v.
evening
news,
individual
employees
have
been
permitted
to
sue
alleging
violation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
john
axelrod
not
necessarily.
i
think--
mr.
john
axelrod
--under
the
landrum-griffin
act,
your
honor,
a
member
has
the
right
to
examine
the
books
and
a
right
to
have
an
accountant
examine
the
books
of
the
local
union.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
correct.
and
if--
mr.
john
axelrod
--the
suit
would
not,
arising
under
the
contract
or
under
the
construction,
then
301--
mr.
john
axelrod
--i
presume
so.
mr.
john
axelrod
in
smith
v.
evening
news,
this
court
stated
that
the
word
301
related
to
suits
between...
related
to
contracts
between
employer
and
labor
organization
rather
than
suits
between
employer
and
labor
organization.
and
it
permitted
an
individual
employee
who
wanted
to
allege
a
breach
of
contract
to
sue
in
federal
court
or
to
sue
in
state
court
alleging
a
breach
of
a
contractual
obligation
owed
to
him.
insofar
as
smith
would
apply
to
this
case,
if
an
individual
employee
could
sue
upon
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
which
he
is
at
best
a
third
party
beneficiary,
then
an
individual
union
member
could
sue
under
a
union
constitution
which
he
is
at
least
a
third
party
beneficiary
of.
it
is
also
clear
that
an
individual
union
member
is
a
party
to
the
union
constitution.
mr.
john
axelrod
he
can
sue
the
employer
individually
but
he
must
also
allege
a
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
john
axelrod
that
was
the
situation
in
smith.
mr.
john
axelrod
he
must
follow
it,
but
he
can
sue
the
employer
if
he
will
allege
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
correct.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
smith.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
also
a
relatively
mundane
one,
the
issue
of
whether
the
word
86
of
the
united
association's
contract
permits
the
severance
of
a
local
into
two
constituent
parts
in
the
guise
of
merging
nine
locals
into
three.
since
1957
when
the
first
section
301
case
involving
union
constitution
reached
the
courts
of
appeals,
with
but
one
exception
prior
to
this
case
national
unions
have
always
argued
that
this
type
of
case
should
be
considered
in
state
courts.
the
one
exception
prior
to
the
instant
case
is
the
sombrotto
case,
and
in
this
case,
when
the
suit
was
filed
in
state
court,
the
united
association
removed.
as
the
4th
circuit
stated
in
parks,
"there
is
no
clear
indication
of
what
congress
meant
in
the
suits
between
labor
organizations
of
section
301,
but
it
is
clear
that,
with
but
two
exceptions,
national
unions
have
never
taken
the
position
now
urged
in
this
court
by
the
united
association.
"
"it
is
clear
that
national
unions
have
never
sought
day
to
day
supervision
of
the
internal
affairs
of
unions.
"
the
key
to
the
interpretation
of
section
301
is
of
course
garnered
from
the
legislative
intent.
the
legislative
intent
must
begin
with
some
consideration
of
what
a
union
is.
in
both
its
original
brief
and
in
its
reply
brief
the
united
association
says,
"union
members
should
remain
free
to
decide
what
the
provisions
of
their
constitution
shall
be.
"
the
united
association's
constitution
provides
for
two
methods
of
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
first
is
at
its
constitutional
conventions
and
its
conventions
at
which
members
are
represented
in
a
form
of
representational
government.
and
the
second
is
by
referendum
in
which
each
member
of
the
association
has
the
right
to
cast
a
vote
to
determine
what
the
parameters
of
its
constitution
will
be.
mr.
john
axelrod
it
suggests
that
the
constitution
is
controlled
by
the
membership
rather
than
by
local
unions.
mr.
john
axelrod
it
is
when
you
are
asked
to
hold
that
the
constitution
is
a
contract
between
national
and
local
unions.
mr.
john
axelrod
i'm
arguing
that
it
is
a
contract.
mr.
john
axelrod
it
is
a
contract
between
member
and
national
union
or
member
and
local
union.
mr.
john
axelrod
it
is
a
contract.
it
is
not
a
contract
between
labor
organizations.
mr.
john
axelrod
within
the
meaning
of
state
law
it
has
always
been
interpreted
to
be
a
contract.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
correct.
i
do
not
believe
congress
meant
union
constitutions
to
be
a
contract
within
the
meaning
of
this
section.
section
301
was
enacted--
mr.
john
axelrod
--i
think
they
meant
no
raiding
agreements,
jurisdictional
dispute
resolution
agreements
between
unrelated
labor
organizations.
i
do
not
believe
they
meant
contracts
between
related
organizations.
mr.
john
axelrod
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
of
which
section
301
is
a
significant
portion,
is
replete
with
examples
in
which
the
congress
said
we
are
not
attempting
to
interfere
in
the
day
to
day
organization
of
a
labor
organization.
senator
taft
said,
we
are
not
telling
members
how
they
should
vote,
we
are
not
telling
labor
organizations
how
they
should
organize.
the
purpose
of
section
301--
mr.
john
axelrod
--it
suggests--
mr.
john
axelrod
--it's
clear
that
in
section
8
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
congress
was
not
attempting
to
work
to--
mr.
john
axelrod
--it
is
a
contract--
mr.
john
axelrod
--but
not
a
contract
between
labor
organizations.
mr.
john
axelrod
it's
a
contract
under
state
law
between
member
and
union,
a
contract
which
also
governs
how
the
subsidiaries
or
how
the
membership
organizes
into
small
groups.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
correct.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
my
position;
yes.
the
purposes
of
section
301
were
to
prevent
disruptions
in
interstate
commerce
caused
by
unions
which
breach
collective
bargaining
agreements,
or
caused
by
secondary
boycotts
or
caused
by
union
misconduct
in
organizing
campaigns.
it's
clear
that
the
impetus
for
section
8(b)
of
the
act
came
from
employers
who
were
complaining
to
congress.
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
member
of
a
labor
organization
complained
to
congress
and
said,
i
cannot
enforce
the
provisions
of
my
union
constitution.
and
the
reason
that
no
individual
member
was
complaining
was
because
in
at
least
45
of
the
then-48
states
and
perhaps
in
47
of
the
48
states,
individual
union
members
had
the
right
to
sue
either
their
union
or
the
officers
of
their
union
who
allegedly
breached
the
union
constitution.
now
that
right
was
not
perfect,
but
it
was
effective,
and
a
member
who
was
illegally
expelled
from
the
union
or
disciplined
by
the
union
in
violation
of
the
union's
constitution,
had
a
right
in
the
vast
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states
to
sue
to
obtain
reinstatement.
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
local
union
officer
complained
to
congress
and
said,
i
can't
get
my
international
union
to
follow
the
dictates
of
its
constitution,
because
under
the
law
of
associations
or
under
the
state
law
concerning
property
members
of
a
labor
organization
and
officers
of
the
labor
organization
had
the
right
to
sue
in
state
court
to
enforce
the
union
constitution.
that
right
has
existed
since
the
late
1800s.
the
issue
in
section
301,
therefore,
is
what
type
of
contracts
between
labor
organizations
presented
the
same
problem
which
employers
faced
in
section
301
litigation
under
collective
bargaining
agreements?
because
members
always
had
the
right
to
sue
their
union
under
the
law
of
associations,
the
issue
is
then,
which
contracts
between
labor
organizations
involved
entities
which
were
not
part
of
the
same
association?
the
labor
organizations
which
are
not
part
of
the
same
association
within
the
meaning
of
the
state
laws
were
a
suit
between
one
national
union
and
another
national
union,
a
contract
between
two
national
unions
involving
no
raid
agreements,
involving
jurisdictional
dispute
mechanisms,
involving
the
affiliation
into
a
confederation
such
as
the
afl
cio.
those
were
the
types
of
contracts
which
could
not
be
litigated
simply
because
the
parties
to
the
contracts
were
not
part
of
the
same
association
and
did
not
have
the
right
of
recourse
to
state
law
under
the
law
of
associations
which
was
prevalent
in
almost
all
of
the
states.
if
you
accept
the
position
of
the
united
association
in
this
case
this
court
will
be
requiring
the
federalization
of
yet
another
area
of
state
law.
now,
in
the
first
case
in
each
of
these
areas
of
state
law,
it
will
be
simple
to
say
that
we
will
apply
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
problem
arose.
but
that
law
will
then
become
federal
law,
and
if
the
law
in
new
jersey
regarding
the
disposition
of
the
property
of
a
local
union
is
different
from
the
law
in
new
york,
in
the
second
case
in
new
york
you
have
a
conflict
between
a
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
federal
law.
since
1907
at
least,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
two
law
review
articles
we
cite
concerning
disposition
of
property,
the
states
have
always
controlled
that
issue.
if--
mr.
john
axelrod
--the
only
area...
that's
correct,
but
then
there
would
be
no
uniformity
which
seems
to
be
the
goal--
mr.
john
axelrod
--that's
contrary
to
the
thrust--
mr.
john
axelrod
--that's
the
sole
exception
to
the
general
proposition
that
uniformity
is
the
goal
of
section
301
cases.
mr.
john
axelrod
no,
because
this
court
in
boeing
accepted
the
proposition
that
state
courts
were
the
proper
forum
for
determining
certain
types
of
labor
disputes.
this
court
in
gonzales
said
that
state
courts
were
the
proper
forum
for
determining
expulsion
or
wrongful
discipline
cases.
uniformity
is
not
the
goal--
mr.
john
axelrod
--that's
correct.
we're
saying
that
these
internal
union
disputes
are
not
federal
labor
law
questions.
mr.
john
axelrod
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
john
axelrod
yes?
mr.
john
axelrod
well,
i'd
first
like
to
state
that
i
disagree
with
mr.
gold's
interpretation
of
the
state
laws.
in
trial,
which
is
the
6th
circuit
case
i
think
he's
relying
upon,
the
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
reach
the
section
301
breach
of
the
union
constitution
issue
because
all
these
facts
can
be
determined
in
the
fair
representation
case
which
we
have
before
us.
so
we're
not
going
to
reach
section
301.
in
parks,
which
i
believe
is
the
4th
circuit
case
he
is
relying
upon,
the
court
said,
this
is
dispute
has
a
traumatic
impact
on
interstate
commerce
on
labor
management
relations.
and
the
dispute
there
involved
the
right
to
strike,
the
union's
right
to
strike.
i
think
parks
can
be
properly
classified
as
one
of
the
court's
taking
the
intermediate
position.
now,
under
our
interpretation
of
the
intermediate
position,
we
would
take
the
position
espoused
by
parks,
by
baker,
by
1199,
by
sidell,
by
local
1219
of
the
carpenters.
all
of
those
cases
deal
with
disputes
in
which
all
of
those
cases
take
the
position
that
there
must
be
concrete
evidence
of
a
disruption
in
labor
management
relations.
mr.
john
axelrod
all
of
those
cases
deal
with
inspection
of
the
complaint.
and
inspection
of
the
complaint
is
particularly
important
here
because
this
is
a
removal
case
and
the
issue
of
removal,
the
appropriateness
of
removal,
must
be
determined
from
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
complaint
says,
we
have
bargaining
relationships
with
a
number
of
employers.
if
this
order
of
consolidation
goes
forward,
our
members
will
be
hurt.
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
will
be
disruption
in
labor
management
relations.
sidell
alleged
a
disruption
in
labor
management
relations.
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
not.
the
most
that
can
be
read
into
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
one
set
of
stable
management
labor
relations
will
be
supplanted
by
a
second
set
of
stable
management
relations,
labor
management
relations.
the
only
harm
suffered
by
anyone
if
the
order
the
consolidation
is
implemented
in
this
case
is
the
harm
to
the
members
of
local
334
who
will
then
be
forced
to
choose
between
seeking
referrals
as
plumbers
and
seeking
referrals
as
pipefitters,
whereas
in
the
past
they
had
the
right
to
be
referred
either
plumbers
or
as
pipefitters.
they
will
also
be
forced
to
compete
with
a
vastly
larger
number
of
plumbers
and
pipefitters
within
the
geographical
jurisdiction
which
used
to
be
local
334's.
the
harm
in
this
case
is
suffered
by
union
members
and
it
is
harm
by
union
members
which
the
united
association
tells
us
does
not
raise
a
federal
case
because
the
united
association
would
not
permit
individual
members
to
sue
in
federal
court
even
upon
alleged
violations
of
the
international
constitution.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
harm
to
an
employer
of
any
disruption
in
labor
management
relations.
so
even
if
you
apply
the
substantial
impact
test
which
the
3rd
circuit
applied,
we
think
the
3rd
circuit
reached
the
proper
conclusion.
in
local
1219,
which
the
united
association
relies
upon,
there
was
an
ongoing
dispute
between
the
seven
local
unions
and
that
ongoing
dispute
prompted
a
number
of
employers
to
file
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
obviously,
in
that
case,
employers
were
involved
and
employers
were
harmed.
employers
were
forced
to
make
difficult
choices
between
competing
claims
for
recognition.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
an
employer
was
forced
to
make
any
choice.
if
the
order
of
consolidation
was
enforced,
local
334
would
cease
its
existence
and
other
local
unions
would
assume
its
contracts.
if
the
order
is
not
enforced,
local
334
will
remain
in
existence
and
there
will
be
no
change.
mr.
john
axelrod
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
govern
removability.
in
this
case,
even
if
you
consider
the
united
association's
answer,
the
united
associations'
answer
denied
that
there
was
even
any
harm
to
any
employees,
any
members.
mr.
john
axelrod
not
in
a
removal
case.
mr.
john
axelrod
after
removal,
the
motion
to
remand
in
a
removal
case
is
determined
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
and
there
is
not
an
evidentiary
hearing.
there
is
not
discovery.
mr.
john
axelrod
the
pending
question,
i
believe,
is
whether
there
would
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
if
the
court
adopts
the
substantial
impact
test.
and
the
answer
is,
perhaps.
the
majority
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
in
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
alleged
section
301
jurisdiction
have
looked
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
they
have
considered
whether
the
complaint
states
broad
conclusory
allegations
or
whether
the
complaint
states
specific
facts
which
demonstrate
an
impact
on
labor
management
relations.
mr.
john
axelrod
that's
correct.
there
was
an
argument
on
the
law
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
position
of
the
united
association
here.
mr.
john
axelrod
but
in
the
normal
case,
if
there
are
conflicting
factual
allegations,
the
motion
to
dismiss
would
under
section
301
and
the
other
party
controverted
those
facts,
then
there
would
have
to
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
there
was
section
301
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
axelrod
it
would
be
a
hearing
solely
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
in
many
cases
interpreting
the
landrum-griffin
act
this
court
has
held
that
the
landrum-griffin
act
was
congress's
first
attempt
to
regulate
internal
union
affairs.
if
this
court
holds
today
that
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
permits
the
federal
courts
to
interpret
union
constitutions,
the
court
will
be
holding
that
in
1947
congress
enacted
a
much
more
pervasive,
much
more
regulatory
scheme
than
it
had
done
in
1959.
mr.
john
axelrod
two
separate
unions?
if
by
that
you
mean
two
national
unions?
mr.
john
axelrod
two
separate
national
unions,
i
think
congress
did
provide
jurisdiction
to
interpret
and
revolve
disputes
on
contracts
between
two
separate
national
unions.
but
what
congress
was
not
doing
was
resolving
internal
union
disputes.
the
case
before
us
today
is
precisely
an
internal
union
dispute.
what
does
the
constitution
of
the
united
association
mean?
that
is
of
no
concern
on
the
facts
of
this
case
to
anyone
except
the
members
of
the
united
association
and
the
association
itself.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
any
employer
is
adversely
affected.
there
is
no
allegation
that
any
employer
in
this
case
would
prefer
to
deal
with
local
334
as
opposed
to
local
14
or
local
274.
absent
that
allegation,
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
any
impact
on
labor
management
relations.
and
the
united
association
does
not
allege
otherwise.
mr.
john
axelrod
section
301
was
designed
to
resolve
disputes
affecting
interstate
commerce
and
the
court
perhaps
could
conclude
that
a
contract
for
the
sale
of
real
estate
or
a
lease
of
office
space
was
not
a
contract
affecting
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
axelrod
perhaps.
probably--
mr.
john
axelrod
--section
301
provides
jurisdiction
under
the
commerce
clause
and
on
one
interpretation
of
the
section
anything
a
union
does
effects
commerce.
mr.
john
axelrod
if
section
301
is
interpreted
to
the
extent
you
propose,
then
it
will--
mr.
john
axelrod
--section
301
does
not
distinguish
between
types
of
suits
and
types
of
contracts.
if
the
contract
is
between
labor
organizations
and
if
the
contract
is
covered
by
section
301,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
which
would
say,
apply
federal
common
law
in
certain
disputes
and
apply
state
law
in
others.
the
hoosier-cardinal
exception
is,
as
i
stated,
the
only
exception
that
we're
aware
of.
in
the
mason
tenders
case,
judge
friendly
urged
this
court...
urged
that
section
301
be
interpreted
to
apply
jurisdictional
only
over
contracts
between
unrelated
national
labor
organizations.
