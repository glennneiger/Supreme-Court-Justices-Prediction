justice
stevens
what
kind
of
law
will
govern
this
dispute?
federal
law
of
interpreting
international
union
constitutions?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
of
course,
there's
a
lot
of
federal
law
with
respect
to
collective
bargaining
agreements,
but
is
there
any
body
of
federal
common
law
dealing
with
fights
between
unions
to
which
there
are
contracts?
you
know,
the
contract
between
two
unions
could
cover
all
sorts
of
different
things.
would
all
of
those
contractual
disputes
be
governed
by
federal
law
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
well,
say,
we'll
say
one
labor
union
rented
office
space
in
new
jersey
to
another
labor
union,
entered
into
a
contract,
and
one
of
them
breached
the
contract.
would
that
be
actionable
in
federal
court?
justice
stevens
and
federal
law
would
govern
the
dispute?
justice
stevens
mr.
gold,
let
me
take
you...
a
little
more
extreme
example.
say
one
union
sells
out
its
office
building
to
an
entirely
unrelated
union
but
it
is
also
a
union.
it
takes
back
a
first
mortgage
and
a
lot
of
notes
and
so
forth,
and
there's
a
foreclosure.
they
could
foreclose
in
the
federal
court
and
federal
law
would
govern
the
foreclosure
proceeding.
justice
stevens
mr.
gold,
are
you
arguing
in
effect
that
in
constitutional
terms,
going
back
to
article
iii,
that
every
time...
this
statute
having
been
enacted,
every
time
one
union
sues
another
it's
a
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution,
regardless
of
what...
even
if
they
say
that
they're
suing
them
for
some
kind
of
a
state
tort
or
whatever
it
might
be?
justice
stevens
of
course,
here
you
have
rather
comprehensive
regulation
by
statute
of
the
relationship
between
the
collective
bargaining
agent
on
the
one
hand
and
the
employer
on
the
other.
there
really
are
no
set
of
federal
rules
of
which
i
am
aware
that
comprehensively
regulate
relationships
among
different
labor
unions,
which
may
or
may
not
be
affiliates,
which
may
enter
into
all
sorts
of
contracts.
and
you're
suggesting
that
there's
a
very
broad
grant,
by
the
creation
of
a
very
broad
area
of
federal
law
that
every
such
contract
shall
hereafter
be
interpreted
by
reference
to
some
substantive
rule
of
federal
law
that
has
not
yet
been
identified.
justice
stevens
but
in
terms
of
statute
or
the
constitution,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
unions
are
affiliated?
justice
stevens
but
you
also
are
contending
then
that
there
is
some
federal
rule
of
law
that
answers
this
dispute?
justice
stevens
mr.
axelrod,
what
law
does
apply
to
this
case
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
mr.
axelrod,
can
i
ask
you,
do
you
take
the
position
that
any
dispute
between
two
international
unions,
arising
out
of
a
contract
between
two
international
unions,
even
one
for
the
sale
of
an
office
building
or
something,
would
give
rise
to
jurisdiction
under
this
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
assuming
it's
a
contract
that
effects
interstate
commerce
but
has
no
other
relationship
to
any
federal
statute,
just
it's
a
lot
of
money
involved
or
maybe
it's
on
the
border
between
two
states
or
something,
would
say
there's
federal
jurisdiction
of
that
suit?
justice
stevens
what
federal
question
would
it
present?
justice
stevens
the
fact
that
it
affects
commerce,
doesn't
it
also
have
to
arise
under
a
federal
law
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution?
justice
stevens
well,
all
301
tells
upon
us
about
is
the
parties.
it
doesn't
tell
us
anything
about
the
federal
law
that
would
govern.
i
mean,
in
that
kind
of
a
suit--
--well,
that
is
true
so
far
as
the
statute
goes,
but
that's...
to
make
that
statement
is
to
disregard
all
the--
--there's
a
lot
of
law
about
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
there's
a
lot
of
federal
law
about
what
kind
of,
you
know,
what
federal
rule
should
apply
to
them,
but
there's
no
federal
law
that
i
know
of
that
tells
me
what
should
be
done
when
one
union
sells
a
building
to
another.
justice
stevens
why
wouldn't
he
be
able
to
sue
on
the
theory
that
the
constitution
is
a
contract
between
the
international
and
the
local
and
one
of
the
provisions
in
that
contract
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual
who
might
be
disciplined?
justice
stevens
no,
on
their
own
right
but
they're
saying
that
if
there
was
a
breach
of
a
contractual
provision
between
the
international
and
the
local,
it
was
made
for
his
benefit.
justice
stevens
well,
no,
supposing
the
local
and
the
international
enter
into
a
side
agreement
saying,
we
hereby
agree
between
us
that
there
shall
be
no
discipline
of
any
member
of
our
local
except
under
the
following
circumstances;
if
it's
that
clear?
