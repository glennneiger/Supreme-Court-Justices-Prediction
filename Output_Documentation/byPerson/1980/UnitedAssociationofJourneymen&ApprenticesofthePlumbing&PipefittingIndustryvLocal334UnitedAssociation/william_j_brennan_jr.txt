mr.
gold,
if
there
isn't
any
present
federal
law
we
have
to
fashion
it
for
you.
justice
jr.
i
mean,
isn't
that
what
lincoln
mills
held?
justice
jr.
mr.
gold,
i
thought
mr.
axelrod
argued
that
a
union
international
constitution
is
not
a
kind
of
contract
with
its
constituent
locals,
but
it
is
a
contract
with
the
union
members,
and
therefore
not
a
contract
between
labor
organizations,
which
is
the
language
of
301.
