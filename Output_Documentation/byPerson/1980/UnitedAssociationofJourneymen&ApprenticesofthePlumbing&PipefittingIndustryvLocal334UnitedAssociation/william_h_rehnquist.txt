justice
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
isn't
there
a
certain
undesirability
in
the
test
advanced
by
the
last
six
circuits
that
you
mentioned,
you
don't
know
when
you
go
into
court
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
or
not,
depending
on
a
whole
bunch
of
factors?
justice
rehnquist
yes
wouldn't
preclude
a
state
action,
would
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
section
301(a)
by
its
terms
has
simply
conferred
jurisdiction,
it
doesn't
say
what
body
of
law
shall
be
applied.
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
we're
bound
by
lincoln
mills
to
construe
the
example
justice
stevens
gave
you
as
governed
by
federal
law?
justice
rehnquist
certainly
in
diversity
cases
we
provide
jurisdiction
without
providing
substantive
law.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
axelrod,
would
you
state
once
more
what
you
just
said
about
the
holding
in
smith
v.
evening
news?
justice
rehnquist
can
a
union
member,
as
the
law
presently
stands,
bring
an
individual
suit,
not
against
the
union
for
failure
to
represent
him
correctly,
but
simply
against
the
employer
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
under
section
301?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
there
is
no
grievance
procedure
he
may
sue
the
employer
directly,
as
the
second
step.
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
just
saying
that
attaching
the
word
"labor"
to
any
number
of
kind
of
disputes
that
may
involve
a
labor
organization
does
not
automatically
make
it
a
federal
labor
law
question?
justice
rehnquist
but
then
you
don't
know
until
after
the
lawsuit
is
over
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
or
not.
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
not
traversable
by
the
union
on
remand,
or
on
a
removal
to
federal
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
at
any
rate
there
could
be
no
hearing
or
factual
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
affected
commerce
or--
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
there
some
difference
between
union
affairs
in
the
sense
of
the
relation
of
the
members
of
the
union
to
the
union
itself
as
opposed
to
the
relationship
between
two
separate
unions?
justice
rehnquist
two
separate
locals
or
two
separate
nationals.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
if
i
may;
before
you
sit
down.
in
the
unlikely
event
that
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
were
to
lease
a
floor
of
the
afl-cio
building
here
in
washington--
justice
rehnquist
--it
is
truly
a
hypothetical.
would
a
dispute
between
them
over
that
contract,
could
that
be
brought
in
federal
court
under
301?
