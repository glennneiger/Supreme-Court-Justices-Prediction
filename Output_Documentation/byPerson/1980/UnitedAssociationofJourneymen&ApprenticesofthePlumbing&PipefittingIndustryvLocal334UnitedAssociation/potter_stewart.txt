justice
stewart
but
the
state
is
obligated
to
apply
federal
substantive
law?
justice
stewart
in
that
case
or
in
lucas
flour,
i've
forgotten
which.
justice
stewart
well,
now,
in
lucas
flour
we
said
we
hold
that
in
case
such
as
this,
incompatible
doctrines
of
local
law
must
give
way
to
principles
of
federal
law.
but
first
of
all,
i
think
you'd
have
to
find
that
there's
something
in
the
local
law
that's
incompatible,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stewart
well,
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
language
of
301
because
we're
talking
here
about
language
of
301
that
confers
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts
of
lawsuits
between
any
labor
organizations;
in
your
case
it's
an
individual.
justice
stewart
i
see.
justice
stewart
i
see.
justice
stewart
--301
confers
jurisdiction
only
over
suits
for
violations
of
contracts.
justice
stewart
i
see.
justice
stewart
well,
maybe
the
federal
law
would
be
that
in
every
case
of
this
type
the
federal
law
incorporates
the
law
of
whatever
state
the
controversy
arose
in.
so
there
would
be
no
conflict
then.
justice
stewart
well,
but
maybe
the
federal
law
would
be
that
in
this
or
that
or
the
other
area
there
need
not
be
uniformity.
justice
stewart
it's
not
contrary
to
a
case
like
hoosier-cardinal.
