mr.

i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
axelrod.
chief
justice
burger
but
then
your...
you
make
that
point,
i
suppose,
or
would
make
that
point
if
a
suit
for
an
accounting
were
brought,
which
would
be
an
equity
action,
and
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
statutes.
is
that
your
point?
or
that's
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
point
you
make?
chief
justice
burger
unless
the
equity
action
for
an
accounting
were
based
upon
a
contract.
but
if
it
was
just
no
contract
alleged
but
was
a
suit
for
an
accounting,
you--
chief
justice
burger
if
they
wanted
an
accounting
suit,
they'd
operate
under
landrum-griffin.
chief
justice
burger
well,
would
you
argue
that
uniformity
was
the
pervasive
concept
of
the
labor
laws,
the
federal
labor
laws?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
answer
that
at
1
o'clock,
counsel.

you've

the
pending
questions

you,
