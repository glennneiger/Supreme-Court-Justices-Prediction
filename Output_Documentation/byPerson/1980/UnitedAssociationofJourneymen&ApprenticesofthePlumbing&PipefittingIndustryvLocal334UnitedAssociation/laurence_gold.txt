mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
3rd
circuit
concerns
the
status
of
suits
brought
on
national
union
constitutions
under
section
301
of
the
labor-management
relations
act
of
1947.
that
provision
states,
and
i
quote
from
page
2
of
our
opening
brief,
the
blue
brief:
"suits
for
violations
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
as
defined
in
the
act
or
between
any
such
labor
organizations
may
be
brought
in
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties,
without
respect
to
the
amount
in
controversy
or
without
regard
to
the
citizenship
of
the
parties.
"
this
case,
as
that
makes
clear,
is
about
the
second
clause
of
that
section.
at
the
present
time,
three
courts
of
appeals,
the
2nd,
4th,
and
6th
have
taken
the
position
that
national
union
constitutions
are
within
that
jurisdictional
grant.
one
court
of
appeals,
the
10th,
has
taken
the
opposite
view,
and
six
other
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
the
view
that
the
jurisdictional
question
depends
on
whether
the
actions
affect
labor
management
relations
and
have
stated
that
test
in
widely
varying
ways.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
our
position,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
part
for
the
consideration
you
just
stated,
is
that
national
constitutions
fit
the
language
of
the
statute,
fit
the
purposes
of
section
301,
and
are
within
the
section.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
better
view
is
that
the
parties
by
their
pleadings
or
the
courts
by
going
though
a
factual
inquiry
should
be
deciding
this
matter
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
we
think
that
that
complicates
the
administration
of
the
law
and
is
not
necessary
in
any
way
to
carry
out
the
proper
view
of
the
statute.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
risks
of
disagreeing
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
or
of
agreeing
with
him,
are
there.
there
are
two
different
straightforward
views,
one,
yes,
and
one,
no.
we
believe
that
for
the
reasons
i
am
going
to
state
yes
is
the
proper
answer
rather
than
no.
obviously,
if
the
court
doesn't
agree
that
yes
is
the
answer
and
maybe
would
be
a
better
answer
as
far
as
we're
concerned
than
no,
but
we
do
think
that
yes
is
the
proper
approach.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
under
dowd
box
v.
courtney
the
jurisdiction
under
301
is
the
jurisdiction
both
in
the
federal
courts
and
in
the
state
courts.
section
301
does
not
displace
state
court
jurisdiction.
it
supplements
it
with
federal
court
jurisdiction.
the
court
has
so
held.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
under
textile
workers
v.
lincoln
mills,
the
section
301
law
is
federal.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
task,
and
our
view
would
be
the
same
as
the
task
the
court
outlined
in
a
case
like
carbon
fuel
in
444
u.s.
where
you
dealt
with
the
question
of
how
to
interpret
a
collective
agreement.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
insofar
as
the
contract
is
between
the
organizations.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
that
that
would
be.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right.
now--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that
would
be
right,
your
honor,
and
i
would--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--and
lincoln
mills,
as
i
remember
it...
i
don't
have
the
quotation
before
me...
suggested
that
one
source
of
federal
law,
even
in
the
collective
bargaining
area,
would
be
the
law
that
had
been
developed
in
the
states.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
would
think
that
in
most
cases
the
federal
law
would
adopt
the
state
law,
but
there
is
no
dispute,
unless
we're
going
to
throw
the
statute
entirely
over
our
shoulder,
that
it
covers
contracts
between
labor
organizations.
the
posit
which
is
opposed
to
our
view
that
the
statute
means
what
it
says
that
there
ought
to
be
coverage
only
for
contracts
between
unrelated
labor
organizations.
your
examples
have
been
between
unrelated
organizations,
and
it
is
more
common,
i
think,
to
have
those
kinds
of
property
or
contractual
relations
between
unrelated
organizations
than
otherwise.
what
would
happen
if
you
were
to
cut
out
agreements
between
related
organizations
is
that
the
section
would
not
cover
matters
which
we
think
certainly
were
at
the
forefront
of
congress's
attention,
agreements
about
work
jurisdiction,
who
should
be
the
collective
representative,
mergers,
affiliations,
no
raiding,
pacts
within
unions.
all
of
these
matters,
which
certainly
on
any
fair
meaning
of
the
term
affect
how
management
and
labor
work
out
their
disputes,
would
be
within
the
section.
i
do
not
know
in
terms
of
the
series
of
hypotheticals
you
have
given
any
indication,
aside
from
the
theory
that
you
would
import
a
limitation
on
affecting
labor
management
relations,
to
reach
the
result
that
an
agreement
between
union
a
and
union
b
concerning
a
promissory
note,
which
is
one
of
the
examples
given
by
respondent,
would
be
outside
the
section
if
the
entities
are
unrelated.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
but
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
the
court
in
the
lincoln
mills
decision,
it
construed
section
301
to
call
for
the
creation
not
only
of
jurisdiction
but
of
federal
law.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
would
be,
that
you
would
reenter
the
very
difficult
dispute
which
the
court
confronted
first
in
the
westinghouse
case
and
then
in
lincoln
mills
as
to
constitutional
questions,
whether
you
can
simply
provide
jurisdiction
without
substantive
law.
it
was
not
without
quite
a
lengthy
and
considered
dialogue
within
the
court
that
that
conclusion
was
reached,
and
over
a
very
vigorous
dissent
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
that
is
provided
for
in
the
constitution.
the
question,
as
i
remember
lincoln
mills,
was
whether
under
the
commerce
clause
congress
could
do
the
same,
and
the
answer
was
(a)
that
it
was
congress's
intent,
reading
all
the
material,
to
provide
for
a
body
of
federal
law,
and
(b)
that
that
intent
had
to
be
read
against
the
background
of
a
constitutional
doubt.
but,
in
saying
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
had
a
situation
in
which
local
a
rented
a
building
to
local
b
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
federal
law
would
be
a
law
different
from
the
law
of
the
state.
that
would
be
a
natural
place
to
absorb
the
state
law.
after
all,
the
purpose
of
section
301
overall
was
to
deal
with
the
difficulties
and
imperfections
of
state
law
in
permitting
parties
to
enforce
contracts.
that
was
the
overriding
interest
to
the
extent
that
federal
law--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--on
statutes
of
limitation,
at
least,
outside
of
the
area
which
we
hope
the
court
will
reach
on
duty
of,
hybrid
duty
of
fair
representation,
section
301
cases.
that
is
an
area
where
the
court
concluded--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
i
think
the
court--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
if
i
can
backtrack
just
very
briefly
to
the
facts,
this
case
concerns
an
effort
by
the
international
union
to
merge
local
unions
in
an
area
of
new
jersey.
the
international
union
proceeded
as
provided
under
the
international
constitution,
an
order
of
consolidation
was
promulgated,
a
hearing
was
held,
in
which
the
affected
unions
could
state
their
views,
a
hearing
officer's
decision
was
issued,
it
was
reviewed
by
the
international
president
and
by
the
general
executive
board
and
finally
promulgated.
at
that
point
one
of
the
local
unions
affected
by
the
proposed
merger
went
into
state
court.
there
was
a
complaint
and
an
amended
complaint.
the
amended
complaint,
which
is
on
page,
begins
on
page
54
of
the
appendix,
states
among
other
points
that
the
defendant
is
an
international
labor
organization
consisting
of
many
locals
in
new
jersey
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
united
states
and
canada,
and
that
the
relationship...
rights
and
duties...
between
local
334
and
the
international
is
governed
by
the
said
constitution.
the
gravamen
of
the
first
count
was
that
the
actions
of
the
general
president
do
not
constitute
a
consolidation
of
local
unions
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
therefore
the
order
insofar
as
it
applies
to
plaintiff
is
illegal.
plainly
from
what
i
have
said,
the
issue
and
the
primary
issue
between
the
parties
was
the
meaning
of
section
86
of
the
national
constitution
which
is
set
out
at
page
25
of
the
record
and
provides
for
the
merger
of
local
unions.
our
basic
position
is
that
national
constitutions
insofar
as
they
determine
the
relationship
between
the
national
and
locals,
and
between
locals
inter
se,
are
contracts
between
labor
organizations
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce.
we
are
proceeding
in
this
instance
without
secondary
guidance
aside
from
the
words
of
the
statute
to
which
i
have
already
referred.
the
second
clause,
the
clause
on
contracts
between
labor
organizations,
was
added
in
conference
and
the
conferees
did
not
explain
their
intent.
in
that
instance
we
believe,
in
such
an
instance
we
believe
that
the
proper
approach
is
to
consult
the
ordinary
contemporaneous
meaning
of
the
terms,
and
as
we
show
at
some
length
on
our
brief,
both
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
under
the
current,
leading
coronado
case
of
this
court
by
mr.
chief
justice
taft
and
uniformly,
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
under
state
law,
constitutions
have
been
regarded
as
contracts
in
the
law.
after
all,
they
are
agreements,
serious
agreements,
which
the
parties
intend
to
define
their
relationship
and
the
courts
have
recognized
them
as
such.
we
think,
too,
that
the
reading
we
suggest
is
in
accord
with
the
basic
purpose
of
section
301.
as
i
have
already
stated,
congress
was
concerned
about
the
difficulties
of
bringing
suit
against
unions
as
unincorporated
associations.
congress
didn't
overestimate
that
difficulty.
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
are
very
careful
compilations
of
the
diversity
in
state
law
on
the
question
of
how
to
sue
an
unincorporated
association,
when
you
can
get
jurisdiction,
when
you
can't,
what
the
prerequisites
are,
and
the
difficulties
of
obtaining
relief.
the
purpose
of
section
301
is
to
end
those
difficulties
and
to
provide
in
congress's
terms
a
high
level
of
responsibility
between
labor
organizations
and
employers
when
they
enter
into
agreements,
and
obviously
between
labor
organizations
because
that
is
what
the
language
says.
i
think,
too,
that
the
evolution
of
the
section,
the
fact
the
congress
completed
its
work
in
the
house
and
the
senate
and
went
to
conference
and
said,
this
section
is
incomplete
as
it
stands
because
it
only
covers
contracts
between
employers
and
labor
organizations,
indicates
that
congress
must
have
been
of
the
view
that
contracts
between
labor
organizations
ought
to
be
enforceable
in
the
same
way
as
contracts
between
labor
organizations
and
employers
in
order
to
accomplish
the
congressional
end,
and
we
think
that
in
light
of
what
congress
said
and
what
it
did
that
the
language
ought
to
be
accorded
its
fair
meaning.
we
think
that
this
case
is
very
much
like
harrison
v.
ppg
industries
in
446
u.s.
where
you
had
to
grapple
with
a
jurisdictional
provision
dealing
with
the
scope
of
authority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
under,
i
believe
it
was,
the
clean
water
act
and
the
question
was
whether
any
other
final
action
meant
any
other
final
action
or
only
some
final
actions.
we
think
in
this
instance
contracts
means
it
is
ordinarily,
contracts
between
labor
organizations
means
what
that
term
would
normally
have
meant
to
the
people
who
drafted
the
section,
who
were
well
aware--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
it
has
to
be
a
suit
on
a
contract
between
two
labor
organizations
and
congress
decided
that
in
preference
to
the
variation,
complexity,
and
difficulty
of
determining
when
such
suits
will
be
entertained,
that
it
was
going
to
state
a
federal
law
which
again,
as
the
court
said
in
carbon
fuel
and
was
presaged
by
the
coronado
case
in
which
the
entities,
the
national
union...
the
national
unions,
if
there
are
two;
the
local
unions
if
there
are
two;
the
national
and
the
local,
if
that
is
the
situation;
are
to
be
treated
as
entities
very
much
like
corporations,
that's
the
model.
and
you
were
going
to
permit
suit.
now,
the
court
in
lincoln
mills,
when
it
was
confronted
with
the
question
of
could
congress
so
act,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
congress's
intent
and
it
might
have
been
a
necessity
to
provide
a
body
of
federal
law.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
i'm
not
contending
anything
concerning
the
relations,
the
contractual
relations
between
unaffiliated
labor
organizations.
that
isn't
in
this
case.
this
case
is
whether
agreements--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--oh,
i
agree
that
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
dispute
about
the
point
you
just
raised.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
understand
except
if
we
go
to
the
expedient
of
saying
that
the
contract
has
to
be
one
which
relates
to
labor
management
relations,
how
the
statute
could
possibly
be
said
not
to
cover
contracts
between
unrelated
labor
organizations.
i
know
of
no
case
which
suggests
that
the
statute
would
not
do
so,
but
the
dispute
between
the
parties
here
is
whether
that
rule
even
assuming
the
gloss
of
affecting
labor
management
relations,
applies
at
all
to
national
constitutions.
we're
not
talking
of,
this
is
not
suit
on
a
promissory
note.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
an
international
union
sought
to
merge
local
unions
in
a
way
which
would
change
the
hiring
hall
patterns
in
the
area
and
change
the
nature
of
the
collective
bargaining
representative.
certainly
we
believe
that
in
that
situation,
since
the
fight
was
over
what
the
national
constitution
meant,
since
national
constitutions
have
been
understood
to
be
contracts,
and
since
on
any...
what
we
would
consider,
under
any
sensible
view,
the
merger
affects
labor
management
relations,
that's
within
301.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
we
say
that
the
federal,
the
question
of
how
to
interpret
this
section,
just
as
the
question
of
how
the
courts
act
in
interpreting
a
collective
agreement,
is
to
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
rather
than
state
law.
after
all,
this
is
a
law
of
contracts.
we're
not
talking
about
the
federal
courts
saying
what
the
relationship
should
be.
the
only
federal
law
concerns
the
rules
of
construction
and
interpretation.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
i
would
think
that...
and
that
was
why
i
answered
mr.
justice
white's
question
the
way
i
did.
where
the
federal
courts
have
to
create
a
body
of
law,
we
don't
believe
that
the
normal
course
is
to
start
from
scratch.
it's
a
process
of
incorporation
except
in
the
case
of
incompatibility.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
visualize
an
incompatibility
between
federal
law
if
the
dispute
is
on
whether
a
local
union
which
owes
another
local
union
that
is
unrelated
$500
has
in
fact
violated
a
promissory
note.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
time
i'd
like
to
try
to
cover
four
basic
points.
the
central
argument
that
has
continuously
been
made
by
respondent
in
this
case
is
that
section
301
does
not
cover
contracts
between
related
organizations.
it
would
read
the
section
to
say,
contracts
between
nonrelated
organizations,
even
though
that
is
not
the
word
of
the
statute.
we
think
that
that
position
which
is
based
on
the
policy
against
regulating
internal
affairs,
stated
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
is
wrong
in
principle.
first
of
all,
as
section
301(a)'s
first
clause
shows,
the
clause
on
collective
bargaining
and
other
contracts
between
employers
and
unions,
congress
at
the
time
passed
section
8(d)
of
the
nlra
which
says
the
government
can't
control
the
substantive
terms
of
bargaining,
and
passed
section
301
which
says
that
the
bargain
reached
by
the
employer
and
union
is
enforceable.
obviously,
congress
was
not
using
the
concept
of
regulation
in
the
sense
of
enforcing
an
agreement
between
parties.
indeed,
we
think
that
respondent
overstates
the
policy
against
intervening
in
union
affairs.
as
this
court
said
in
the
boeing
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
one
in
point
and
cited
by
respondent,
and
i'm
quoting
from
412
u.s.
73,
"the
reason
for
this
determination
not
to
reach
certain
fines
was
that
congress
had
not
intended
by
enacting
section
8(b)(1)(a)
to
regulate
the
internal
affairs
of
the
unions
to
the
extent
that
would
be
required
in
order
to
base
unfair
labor
practice
charges
on
the
levying
of
such
fines.
"
in
other
respects
congress
did
indeed
regulate
in
any
terms.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
that
is
the
second
argument
that
respondent
makes.
it
is
made
for
the
first
time
on
oral
argument
but
it's
never
been
contented
before.
we
think
it
is
contrary
to
the
law.
the
case
respondent
cited
in
its
brief
fittingly
enough
is
from
new
jersey,
harris
v.
geier,
and
the
language
which
we
quote
in
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
brief,
page
5,
is
that
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
international
brotherhood
constitute
a
contract
between
the
members
of
local
461
inter
se
and
between
them
and
the
general
body
of
membership
of
the
brotherhood,
and
between
the
local
and
the
joint
council
and
other
agencies
of
the
brotherhood.
this
suit
is
a
suit
by
a
local
union
seeking
to
keep
its
work
and
territorial
jurisdiction
and
its
charter
from
the
ua.
it's
suit
between
two
organizations
about
their
relationship
and
in
common
sense
and
in
the
law
it's
a
suit
between
labor
organizations.
mr.
axelrod
is
quite
right,
and
we
agree,
and
we
said
we
agreed,
in
our
reply
brief,
that
there
are
other
suits
based
on
union
constitutions
which
concern
the
contract
between
the
union
and
the
member.
if
a
union
member
complains
about
discipline,
as
the
quotation
i
read
indicates,
he
is
suing
on
his
contract
with
the
union
and
under
the
plain
language
of
section
301(a)
that
suit
is
not
covered
any
more
than
a
suit
by
an
individual
against
an
employer
based
on
a
separate
employment
contract
allowed
by
a
collective
agreement
is
a
suit
within
section
301.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
he
may
able
to
sue
in
a
case
like
this.
in
other
words,
individuals
might
be
able
to
sue
on
behalf
of
their
local
where
they're
bringing--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--but
the
union
constitution
is
two
contracts
or
two
types
of
contracts.
insofar
as
the
member
has
a
right
not
to
be
disciplined,
that's
his
contract
with
the
organization,
would
be
a
misnomer.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
if
there
were
a
clear
case
of
that
kind
then
the
situation
would
be
equivalent
to
the
situation
of
smith
v.
evening
news,
but
if
it
is
not
that
clear,
the
historic
understanding
is
that
you
have
a
series
of
contracts
intermixed.
and
sometimes
you're
suing
on
one
and
sometimes
on
the
other.
this
happens
to
be
the
kind
of
suit
that
is
within
301,
and
normal...
every
one
of
the
examples
that
mr.
axelrod
gave
of
member
suits
is
the
kind
which
we
think
is
basically
on
a
contract
between
a
member
of
the
organization
and
not
under
301.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
this
is
truly
a
hypothetical.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
unless
the
view
of
the
circuits
which
have
said
that
there
has
to
be
an
effect
on
labor
relations
is
excepted,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be,
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
we
think
that
that
is
the
view.
let
me
just
note
that
in
lincoln
mills
the
court
said
that
state
law,
if
compatible
with
the
purpose
of
section
301,
may
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
find
the
rule
that
will
best
effectuate
the
federal
policy.
that
would
seem
to
be
that
kind
of
situation.
alternatively,
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
effects
test,
we
think
it
has
to
be
in
terms
of
classes
of
cases.
certainly
a
no
raid
agreement,
a
merger
agreement,
that
determines
who
the
collective
bargaining
representative
is,
is
within
the
class
of
cases
where
you
have
an
effect
on
labor
relations.
if
you
don't
have
a
class
based
test,
then
you're
going
to
get
into
the
point
you
raised
originally
where
you're
going
to
have
a
side
trial,
or
else
you're
going
to
allow
the
plaintiff
by
his
pleadings
to
determine
whether
federal
law
applies
or
state
law
applies.
so
our
basic
position
is,
congress
has
told
us
what
it
wanted.
it
has
not
used
any
modifiers.
the
situation
is
like
harrison
v.
ppg.
our
second
position
is
that
if
an
effect
is
necessary,
it
ought
to
be
in
terms
of
a
class
of
cases
and
certainly
what
we
have
here,
which
determines
who
the
collective
bargaining
representative
is,
who
faces
the
employer,
what
the
territorial
and
trade
jurisdiction
is
within
that
effects
test,
whether
or
not
the
dispute
is
between
related
organizations
or
unrelated
organizations.
thank
you.
