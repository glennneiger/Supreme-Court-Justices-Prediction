justice

but,
mr.
smith,
the
one
year
isn't
based
on
the
anticipated
period
of
mining
out
a
coal
seam,
is
it?
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ten-year
presumed
life
of--
justice
stevens
--you
mean
the
one-year
is?
justice
stevens
or
the
ten-year?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
what
i'm
saying,
the
one-year
is
not
related
to
any
prediction
about
how
long
it
takes
to
exhaust
a
coal
mine;
maybe
ten
years
would
be.
justice
stevens
there
aren't
very
many
coal
mines
that
operate
for
one
day,
are
there?
justice
stevens
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government's
interest,
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
a
depletion
allowance,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
government
whether...
say
it
takes
20
years
to
mine
out
a
coal,
or
ten
years
to
exhaust
a
coal
mine,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
there
were
20
different
operators,
each
of
whom
succeeded
one
another
at
six-month
intervals
or
ten
at
one-year
intervals,
or
one
for
working
the
whole
20
years?
why
isn't
there
the
same
amount
of
coal
being
mined
and
depleted
and
the
same
reason
for
the
depletion
allowance,
regardless
of
the
period
that
the
lease
is
in
effect?
justice
stevens
well,
the
person
who
is
the
miner
at
the
time
mines
it
and
sells
it.
he
has
the
title
to
the
coal
and
he
sells
it.
justice
stevens
but
only
one
person
has
a
right
to
sell
the
coal.
justice
stevens
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
sell
the
coal.
they
had
to
sell
it
to
the
lessor
at
a
fixed
price.
justice
stevens
they
mined
on
a
contract.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
you're
responding
to
my
question.
in
terms
of
tax
policy,
say
you
have
a
20-year
life
of
a
mine
and
one,
say
one
person
was
going
to
mine
it
out
and
get
the
full
depletion
allowance.
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
government
whether
one
person
does
it
for
20
years
four
people
do
it
for
five
years
each,
or
40
people
do
it
for
three
months?
justice
stevens
you
don't
care
how
it's
decided,
so
long
as
you
get
a
ruling?
justice
stevens
mr.
smith,
can
i
summarize
it
just
to
be
sure
i
have
it
right?
if
you
had
the
20-year
lease
situation,
the
lessor
would
get
both
capital
gains
treatment
and
cost
depletion?
justice
stevens
and
he
would
get
that
in
this
case
regardless
of
how
we
decide
it?
justice
stevens
but
wouldn't
you
agree,
mr.
smith,
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
even
if
they'd
been
20-year
deals,
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
economic
interest
on
the
part
of
the--
justice
stevens
mr.
katz,
i
understood
mr.
smith
to
be
saying
that
he
was
referring,
not
to
percentage
depletion,
but
rather
to
what
he
called
a
"cost
depletion",
which
as
i
understand
it
is
really
nothing
more
than
the
cost
in
any
capital
gains
transaction,
and
you're--
justice
stevens
--well,
you
agree
that
they
do
get
the
ten
cents
in
your
hypothetical
example?
justice
stevens
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
we
call
it
cost
depletion
or
not.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
mr.
smith
did
not
suggest
that
the
lessor
got
percentage
depletion.
at
least
i
certainly
didn't
understand
him
to
suggest
that.
justice
stevens
well,
i
thought
he
referred
to
cost
depletion
there
too.
so
i
may
have--
justice
stevens
--it
doesn't
matter.
we...
all
right,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
we've
heard
him
before.
justice
stevens
--well,
based
on
that
theory,
it
would
be
a
function
of
the
cost
invested
in
it.
it's
not
related
to
cost
at
all,
it's
related
to
sales
price.
