mr.
stuart
a.
smith
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
three
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
they
involve
an
important
question
of
taxation
in
the
mineral
area,
as
to
which
there
is
a
conflict
of
decisions
in
the
lower
courts.
specifically,
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
provision
in
a
mineral
lease
permitting
the
lessor
to
terminate
the
lease
on
30
days'
notice
without
any
cause
deprives
the
lessee
of
an
economic
interest
in
the
minerals
in
place
so
that
the
lessee
is
not
entitled
to
the
depletion
deduction
permitted
under
section
611(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
facts
of
all
three
cases
are
virtually
identical
and
can
be
summarized
briefly
as
follows:
respondents
are
all
direct--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--there
are
some
differences,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
for
the
purposes,
i
think,
that
the
case
has
come
here...
i
think
neither
party
thinks
the
differences
are
germane,
but,
you're
right,
there
are
some
minor
differences.
principally,
the
respondents
are
all
lessees
under
coal
leases
and
as
under
these
leases
they
were
authorized
to
remove
coal,
in
consideration
of
a
stated
royalty
per
ton.
the
leases
each
permitted
respondents
to
sell
coal,
the
coal
that
was
extracted,
to
anyone
at
any
price.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
surely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
we
don't
concede
that
point,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
we
think
it's
a
little
late
in
the
day
for
the
respondent
swank
to
be
raising
it,
because
while...
may
i
refer
the
court
to
pages
54a
and
55a
of
the
appendix,
which
discusses
this
problem
and
specifically
paragraph
(c)
on
page
55a
which
says:
"statements
to
the
effect
that
northumberland
county
would
not
terminate
a
lease
except
for
cause
were
made
to
various
individual
mine
operators
including
taxpayer,
in
public
meetings
of
the
commissioners,
and
reported
in
the
press.
"
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
and
this
is
from
the
stipulation
of
facts:
"however,
no
assurance
was
given
that
the
county
commissioners
could
not
cancel
a
lease
without
cause.
"
i
think
that
the
court
of
claims
assumed
for
purposes
of
its
decision
that
the
swank
lease
was
a
termination
without
cause.
respondent
swank
never
took
exception
to
that
finding
and
i
think
that
for
purposes...
as
the
case
comes
here,
i
think
that
is
agreed,
that
must
be
agreed,
that
the
swank
lease
as
well
as
the
bull
run
and
black
hawk
lease
all
provided
for
termination
without
cause.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
that...
because
if
the
lease
were
terminated
for
cause...
and
in
fact,
there
were
other
provisions
of
these
leases
that
were
terminable,
because,
for
example,
if
the
respondents
didn't
pay
their
rent
or
their
royalties,
the
leases
were
terminable.
we're
not
contending
that
that
deprives
the
lessee
of
the
depletion
deduction.
in
any
event,
each
lease
provided,
as
i
said,
that
the
lessor
could
terminate
without
cause
on
30
days'
notice,
and
it
was
on
this
basis
that
the
internal
revenue
service
disallowed
the
respondents'
depletion
deductions
on
the
ground
that
none
of
the
respondents
had
an
economic
interest
in
the
minerals
covered
by
their
leases.
the
court
of
claims
decided
otherwise
on
the
authority
of
its
earlier
decision
in
bakertown
coal
company,
which
essentially
presents
the
same
question.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
internal
revenue
service's
position,
and
it
is
our
position,
that
one
year
is
the
line.
in
other
words,
a
cancellation
on
one
year's
notice
and
beyond
is
all
right,
but
anything
less
than
a
year
violates
or
undermines--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
no;
essentially,
it
does
deprive
the
lessee
of
the
economic
interest
in
the
coal
in
place,
because--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
on
the
basis,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
of
a
long-standing
published
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
so-called
gcm.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
it's
an
announced
position
which
is
30
years--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--a
gcm
is
an
old
form
of
ruling
called
general
counsel's
memorandum.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
this
is
a
classic
statement
in
the
depletion
area
because
what
it
did
was,
to
permit
lessees
like
an
operator
in
this
situation,
but
announced
that
if
the
lease...
the
lease
had
to
be
for
more
than
a
nominal
period.
it
could
only
be
terminable
on
more
than
nominal
notice,
and
the
service
announced
in
that
case
that
generally
one
year
was
the
rule.
and
in
fact,
the
service
has
ruled
subsequently,
more
recently...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
can
cite
the
court
to
two
revenue
rulings
that
i
think
bring
this
matter
up
to
date:
revenue
ruling
74-506
and
74-507,
which
were
cited
at
1974-2,
cumulative
bulletin
178
and
179,
which
more
or
less
reaffirmed
the
one-year
rule.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
are
not.
i
just
discovered
these
two
rulings
in
preparation
for
the
argument.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
with
the
one-year
rule.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
no,
they
don't.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
particular
ruling
that
involves
coals
particular
ruling
that
talks
about
the
one-year
rule,
involves
coal,
74-507.
74-506
deals
with
phosphate
rock
deposits,
and
in
that
particular
instance
the
taxpayer-lessee
had
a
five-year
lease
and
then
he
renewed
it
for
another
six
months.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
these
are
revenue
rulings.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
the
service
takes
the
position
that
one
year
is
the
general
rule
of
thumb,
and
the
taxpayer...
the
general
principle
is
that
the
taxpayer
has
to
have
the
right
to
mine
the
deposit
to
exhaustion
in
order
to
have
an
economic
interest
in
minerals
in
place.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
coal
rate
is
ten
percent,
and
these
two
rulings
that
i've
adverted
to,
which
talk
about
the
one-year
rule,
are
in
the
context
of
coal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
that's
simply
a
rate
that's
negotiated
between
industries
and
the
congress,
i
think,
and
the
treasury.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
rates
in
the
code.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
but
it's
a
general
rule
of
thumb
that
if
you
had...
basically,
since
the
general
principle
is
that
you
have
to
have
something
substantial,
you
have
to
have
a
capital
interest
in
minerals
in
place.
and
simply
to
say,
you
know,
if
you
have
like
a
one...
a
right
to
do
something
for
one
day,
it
wouldn't
be
a
terribly
significant
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
but
in
fact,
the
rhetorical
question
that
the
court
of
claims
asked
in
bakertown
about
it,
saying
that
this
is
not
a
one-day
case,
apparently
there
is
a
case
now
pending
before
the
court
of
claims
involving
a
one-day
termination
in
turquoise
mining.
but
anyway,
the
basic
point
is
that
in
order
to
have
this
right
to
mine
a
deposit
to
exhaustion...
and
it's
basically
what
the
court
talked
about
in
paragon
and
in
parsons--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
simply,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
question
of
who
has
it,
since
the
general
rule--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--exactly,
exactly.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
people
involved
in
mining
operations,
extracting
of
minerals
who
have
something
much
less
than
an
economic
interest
to
satisfy.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
only
one
person
has
a
right
to
sell
the
coal,
but
indeed,
in
parsons
and
in
paragon,
the
taxpayers
before
the
court...
those
are
the
two
decisions
that
we
think
bear
very
heavily
on
the
question
before
the
court...
in
both
those
cases
the
miners
there
were
the
only
persons
who
had
the
right
to
have
the
coal,
and
the
court
held
that
they
didn't
get
the
depletion
allowance
because
they
didn't
satisfy
the
economic
interests.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
they...
yes;
indeed,
they
had
to
sell--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--exactly.
but
they
were
selling
the
coal.
here,
of
course...
that's
true;
they
did
have
the
right
to
sell
the
coal
to
anyone
they
pleased,
at
any
price.
but
we
submit
that
the
terminability
clause,
that
that
right
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
terminability
clause.
it's
simply
like
saying.
i
have
a
five-year,
lease
on
an
apartment
and
my
landlord--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
but
essentially,
the
reason
this
case
is
here,
in
order
to
have
the
court
announce
a
rule
that
both
lessors
and
lessees
and
the
treasury
will
honor
as
the
uniform
rule.
as
matters
now
stand,
in
the
court
of
claims
the
rule
is
one
way,
and
in
the
3rd
circuit
the
rule
is
another.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i'd
like
to...
i
would
not
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
this
was
an
overwhelming
important
question
of
tax
policy,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
bar
and
the
treasury
depend
upon
the
application
of
uniform
rules,
and
we
think
that
the
uniform
rule
in
this
case
ought
to
be
that
the
termination
clause
should
be
regarded
as
a
powerful
right
against
which
all
other
rights
must
be
subordinated.
and
indeed,
this
concept
is
not
foreign
to
the
tax
law.
although
the
respondent
suggests
that
this
is
a
terrible
thing
that
the
treasury
is
imposing
upon
this
in
the
area
of
trusts,
in
the
area
of
estate
taxes,
the
right
to
revoke
or
the
right
to
pull
back
something
is
extremely
important,
and
we
submit
that
here,
where
the
lessor
has
the
right
to
cancel
a
lease
without
any
cause
at
all,
essentially
saying,
get
out
in
30
days,
really
reduces
these
respondents
to
having
nothing
more
than
a
right
to
mine
an
additional
30
days
of
coal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
if
each
operator...
okay.
well,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
swank,
that
the
lessor
in
swank
is
a
municipality
or
a
county
is
simply
a
fortuity
and
i'm
not
really
sure
that
the
depreciation--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--right.
well,
the
answer,
i
suppose,
is
to
have
appropriate
counsel
and
claim
it
in
a
variety
of
years
so
that
when
it
gets
disallowed
in
one
year
you
don't
lose
it
completely.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
on
the
question
of
the
other
two
respondents
which
were
taxpayers,
those
respondents
get
cost
depreciation
and
capital
gains
under
section
631.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
owners.
and
the
capital
gains...
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
points
that
the
court
of
claims
made
that
we
think
is
so
ill
taken,
that
they
said,
my
goodness,
we've
got
to
give
it
to
these
respondents
because
otherwise
nobody
will
get
it,
and
that's
simply
not
the
case.
the
owners
in
those
cases
will
get
631(c)
capital
gains
treatment,
which
is
a
special
provision
in
the
code
only
for
coal
and
iron
ore,
and
it's
really
quite
beneficial,
and
it's
really
hard,
it's
really
hard
to
accept
the
force
of
the
court
of
claims'
point
on
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
now,
getting
back
to
what
i
think
is...
to
be
sure,
the
court
in
parsons
and
in
paragon
did
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
contractors
in
those
cases
had
the
right
to
sell
coal
to
anyone
they
chose.
but
i
think
that
that
doesn't
diminish
the
force
of
the
court's
"emphasis"
in
both
those
cases
on
the
termination
provisions
in
those
contracts.
in
both...
in
fact,
in
parsons,
the
court
mentioned
it
on
three
different
occasions.
it
talks
about
it
every
time
it
described
the
contracts.
it
talked
about
them
being--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--what?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
was
one
of
the
times
it
mentioned
it
but
on
pages
224,
225,
and
226...
i
think
225
is
where
the
seven
factors
are
sketched
out.
the
court
talked
about
termination,
and
indeed,
the
court
talked
about
termination
in
paragon
as
well,
and
referred
back
to
swank.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
depletion
allowance
does
not
go
to
both
people
on
the
same
income;
that
is
true.
that
is
what
the
court
has
said.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
fact,
i
don't
think
they
could,
because
i
think
that
the
transaction
would
still
fit
section
631(c).
it
would
be
a
transfer
with
a
retained
economic
interest.
and
as
i
understand
the
matter,
the
owners
have
their
overriding
royalty
is
a
retained
economic
interest.
they
would
continue
to
get
capital
gains
treatment
on
their
royalties.
they
get
capital
gains
treatment
no
matter
how
the
court
decides.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
the
lessee
has
an
uncancellable...
if
the
lessee
has
a
noncancellable
lease
for
20
years,
then
the
lessee
gets
percentage
depletion.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
owner
gets
capital
gains
on
his
royalties
and
also,
as
i
understand
it,
he
can
claim
cost
depletion.
in
other
words,
on
each
dollar
that
he
gets
back--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
don't
think
it
would
affect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
because
i
think
the
owner
here
would
continue
to
get,
only
because...
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
say
this.
your
general--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--your
general
statement
about
sharing
depletion
deductions
is
correct,
but
it's
not
true
for
purposes
of
coal,
because
it's
a
peculiar
rule
of
section
631(c)
which
says
that,
you
know,
in
such
a
situation
the
owner
of
the
coal
deposit
is
not
eligible
for
percentage
depletion.
so
he
can't
get
it.
and
in
fact,
the
court
of
claims
in
bakertown,
in
the
bakertown
coal
company,
i
think
at
footnote
2--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--he
has
an
economic
interest
in
the
minerals
in
place.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
gets
percentage
depletion.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
does
the
landowner
get?
the
land-owner
gets
on
his
retained
royalty,
under
section
631(c),
because
he
has
made
a
transfer
that
fits
that
section,
he
gets
capital
gains
treatment
on
his
royalties,
the
basis
of
which--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--under
section
631(c).
it
says
that
you
get
capital
gains
treatment--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
have,
in
my
view,
no
effect
on
the
landlord,
because
this
still
would
be
a
section
631(c)
case.
the
other
thing
really
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
lessee
is
eligible
for
percentage
depletion.
the
lessor,
because
of
the
peculiar...
section
631(c)
is
not
elective
and
if
you
make
a
transfer
like
that
in
the
coal
area,
you
are
not
eligible
for
percentage
depletion.
the
statute
is
clear
on
that.
it's
a
special
benefit
for
transfers
of
coal
deposit...
you
know,
interests
in
coal
deposits
and
more
or
less,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
trade-off
that
says,
you
don't
get
percentage
depletion
on
your
overriding
royalties
the
way
you
would
if
you
were
in
oil
or
a
variety
of
other
minerals
but
you'll
get
capital
gains
treatment
and,
you
know,
correspondingly,
cost
depletion.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right;
that's
right.
well,
getting
back
to
what
i
think
is
sort
of
germane
here,
and
that
is,
on
the
question
of
the
importance
of
the
terminability
provision,
in
parsons,
like
this
case,
there
were
clear
and
explicit
termination
clauses
in
the
contracts.
but
in
paragon,
the
importance
of
terminability
to
the
court
was
so
significant
that
the
court
implied
a
termination
right
on
the
behalf
of
the
lessors,
on
the
fact
that
the
contractors
could
have
walked
off
at
any
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
is
true,
that
is
true,
because...
exactly.
but
in
our
view,
and
i
think
that,
really,
this
is
the
important
thing,
that
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more,
that
if
you
can't
sell
the
coal
to
anyone
you
please
but
you
have
to
sell
it
to
the
lessor,
you
really
are
a
kind
of
glorified
coal
miner.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
of
termination
on
30
days'
notice
without
cause
is
an
equally
important
right
that
subordinates
the
whole
thing,
because
it
basically
says,
the
whole
deal,
i
can
nullify
the
whole
deal
anytime
i
want.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
operating
under
those
kinds
of
restraints
you
don't
really
have
much
of
a
deal
anymore
than
you
would
if
you
had
to
sell
the
coal
to
the
lessor.
it
seems
to
me
that
both
those
factors
are
of
equal
weight.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
do
i
see
any?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
it
seems
to
me
that
paragon
follows
the
rule
of
parsons.
and
indeed,
that
was
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
other
points
that
the
respondents
make
and
the
court
of
claims
made
is
that,
well,
it's
very
nice
to
talk
about
termination
and
the
terminability,
but
that's
really
a
wholly
theoretical
thing
and
here
nobody
terminated.
what
does
that
matter?
it's
kind
of
instructive...
i
was
reading
the
dissent
in
parsons,
in
paragon
this
morning,
and
the
dissent
made
much
the
same
complaint
that
the
respondents
do
here
in
which
the
court
of
claims...
it's
incredible
that
no
one
has
sort
of
made
the
analogy
that
the
same
complaint...
the
court
tries
to
assimilate
this
case
to
parsons
by
stating
that
paragon
could
have
terminated
the
interest
of
the
operators.
but
the
actual
facts
are
really
that
paragon
never
gave
the
slightest
intimation
that
it
might
terminate
anyone's
contract,
and
in
our
view
it's
the
right
to
terminate
that's
important,
because
depletion
and
the
allowances
that
flow
from
these
mining
contracts
necessarily
have
to
turn
on
the
rights.
the
statute
has
to
be
administered
in
accordance
with
the
rights
that
the
parties
set
forth
in
their
contracts.
and,
indeed--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes,
in
our
view
it
does
equate.
they
are
equivalents
for
these
purposes.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
aren't
property
law
distinctions
but
i
think
the
court
has
said
often
in
this
area
that
property
law
really
has
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
governing
principles
in
this
area.
so,
essentially,
in
our
view,
these
respondent-lessees
are
much
like
tenants
at
sufferance.
they
can
be
ejected
at
any
time,
and
if
they
are
ejected
at
any
time...
they
can
be
ejected
at
any
time.
whether
in
fact
they
are
or
they
aren't
is
irrelevant.
the
essential
point
is
that
they
don't
have
an
economic
interest
in
coal
in
place,
and
if
they
don't
have
that
they
don't
get
the
depletion
allowance.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
just
have
a
couple
of
points.
as
i
understand
why
the
gcm
which
has
been
bandied
about
today
has
been
rendered
obsolete,
it's
simply
because
it's
been
subsumed
in
other
authorities
including
this
court's
decisions
in
parsons
and
in
paragon,
and
in
the
rulings
which
i
cited
today.
i
don't
think
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
notions
that
congress
enacted
the
depletion
deduction.
i
think
we
can
all
agree
on
that.
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
these
respondents
have
an
economic
interest
in
coal
in
place.
and
in
our
view,
they
don't
have
any
more
than
the
right
to
stay
there;
and
they
didn't
have
any
more
than
a
right
to
stay
there,
more
than
an
additional
30
days.
and
in
our
view,
that
is
not
significant
enough
to
have
an
economic
interest
in
coal
in
place.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
is
absolutely
irrelevant.
you
cannot
administer
the
statute,
in
our
view,
on
the
basis
of
the
hindsight,
look-back.
thank
you.
