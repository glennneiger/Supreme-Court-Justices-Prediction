but
there
are
some
differences,
aren't
there,
mr.
smith?
justice
blackmun
could
i
interrupt
you
at
that
point?
justice
blackmun
there
is
talk
in
one
of
the
briefs...
i
think
it's
swank...
that
the
county
agreed
not
to
terminate
the
lease.
do
you
agree
or
concede
that
point,
or
do
you
not?
justice
blackmun
well,
of
course,
in
these
cases,
maybe
it
doesn't
fit
the
theory,
but
certainly
the
cutting
edge
of
the
cases
are
these:
in
swank,
if
the
operator
doesn't
get
the
allowance,
nobody
does,
because
the
lessor
is
a
tax-free
municipality.
so
the
government
benefits.
in
the
other
two,
i
think
the
facts
are
that
each
operator
mined
to
exhaustion.
justice
blackmun
if
it
weren't
for
the
government's
advantage,
just
as
in
the
old
days
when
a
taxpayer
tried
to
prove
the
year
of
loss
of
a
bad
debt,
he
always
guessed
wrong.
justice
blackmun
well,
mr.
smith,
i
understand
your
position,
i'm
just--
justice
blackmun
--thinking
of
the--
justice
blackmun
--the
owners
do.
the
owners
do.
justice
blackmun
i
take
it,
mr.
smith,
that
a
mining
contract,
in
paragon
and
parsons,
equates
in
your
view
with
a
mining
lease,
such
as
we
have
here.
justice
blackmun
well,
in
the
old
days,
a
gcm
was
pretty
high
up
in
the
hierarchy.
