justice
rehnquist
and
is
that
a
one-year,
on
the
basis
of
a
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
--well,
i've
heard
of
id's
and
treasury
regionations,
but
gcm?
justice
rehnquist
gcms.
justice
rehnquist
are
they
in
the
appendix?
justice
rehnquist
does
the
service
take
the
position
that
one
year
is
the
cut-off
line
on
every
type
of
case?
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
smith,
do
you
see
any
tension
or
inconsistency
between
parsons
and
paragon?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
then
you
say
that
the
regulation
issued
under
631
is
not
valid?
if
it
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
one-year
period?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mentioned
in
my
comment
to
mr.
smith
that
i
had
never
heard
of
gcm.
there
are
lots
of
parts
of
the
tax
court
i've
never
heard
of
too,
but
you
say
they
don't
have
the
force
of
a
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
how
long,
in
fact
where
each
of
these
leases
mined
by
the
claimants?
justice
rehnquist
when
they
set
27
percent
for
oil,
they
didn't
really
think
that
the
oil
was
going
to
be
necessarily
played
out
in
three
years?
