justice
stewart
and
it's
only
if
they
did
that
the
issue
is
here
at
all.
justice
stewart
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
it's
all
right
or
whether
it
violates
something.
it
is
a--
justice
stewart
--whether
or
not
he
can
take
the
deduction.
justice
stewart
--well,
only
with
coal?
justice
stewart
because
the
percentage
depletions
are
quite
different--
justice
stewart
--depending
upon
different
presumptions
as
to
how
long
it's
going
to
take
to
exhaust
the
resource.
justice
stewart
and
maybe
one
year
would
be
right
for
some
minerals,
and
quite
wrong
for
others.
justice
stewart
what
are
those,
gcms?
justice
stewart
you
might
have
an
allowable
depletion
allowance
deduction
of,
say,
25
percent
and
that
would
be
based
upon
the
presumption
that
the
asset
is
going
to
be
fully
depletable
in
four
years.
you
might
have
on
allowable
depletion
allowance
deduction
of
ten
percent,
which
would
be
based
upon
the
presumption
that
the
asset
is
going
to
be
fully
depletable
in
ten
years.
and
this
rate
is
one
year.
justice
stewart
and
in
this
case
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
the
lease
were
just
a
day-to-day
lease
terminable
at
will,
so
long
as
in
fact
the
lessee
stays
there
and
mined
it
through
a
taxable
year,
then
he's
entitled
to
the
percentage
depletion?
justice
stewart
well,
i
think
you
told
us
why.
you
think--
justice
stewart
--that's
right.
justice
stewart
and
the
theory
is...
and
perhaps
it
is
just
a
theory,
because
i
think
the
ten
percent
is
probably
a
politically
negotiated
figure--
justice
stewart
--but
the
theory
must
be
then
that
the
ordinary
mine
run
coal
mine,
the
asset
is
wasted
and
depleted
at
the
end
of
ten
years.
justice
stewart
well,
that
must
be
the
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
what
other
theory
could
possibly
support
any
depletion
at
all,
or
particularly
a
ten
percent
depletion?
justice
stewart
it's
a
wasting
asset
that's
completely
exhausted
in
ten
years.
that
must
be
the
underlying
proposition.
justice
stewart
in
order
to
have
any
depletion
allowance
deduction,
you
must
have
a
wasting
asset.
justice
stewart
and
then,
in
your
view,
the
fact
that
they
did
stay
there
and
mine
the
coal
until
it
was
exhausted
in
two
out
of
these
three
cases
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
