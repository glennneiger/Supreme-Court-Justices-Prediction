justice
white
and
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
they
had...
if
you
accepted--
justice
white
so
depletion
to
the
operator
is
giving
an
additional
allowance?
justice
white
one
of
the
seven
factors.
justice
white
as
one
of
the
seven
factors?
justice
white
mr.
smith,
are
you
finished?
justice
white
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
your
argument
that
in
the
two
cases
the
owner
was
in
effect
getting
the
allowance.
suppose
it
were
held
that
this
lessee
here
did
have
an
economic
interest
in
the
minerals
in
place,
my
experience
always
was
that
the
depletion
allowance
is
going
to
go
to
one
or
the
other
but
not
to
both.
justice
white
well,
now,
what
if
this
court
ruled
that...
with
the
court
of
claims...
but,
said,
well,
we
don't
need
to
decide
whether
the
owner
is
getting
depletion
or
not,
could
the
service
do
anything
about
it?
could
they
deny
the
capitals
gains
treatment
to
the
lessor?
justice
white
but,
if
a
lessee
has
an
uncancellable
lease
for
20
years,
the
depletion
allowance
is
shared,
isn't
it?
justice
white
percentage
depletion.
justice
white
and
what
does
the
owner
get?
justice
white
on
that,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
again,
what
if
we
held
in
this
case
that
the
lessee
had
an
economic
interest
in
the--
justice
white
--wouldn't
it
affect
the
amount
of
depletion
the
owner--
justice
white
--in
effect?
justice
white
your
answers
sound
inconsistent,
i'm
not
sure.
justice
white
well,
so
i'll
ask
you
again,
what
about
in
a
coal
mining
case
where
the
lessee
has
a
lease
that's
good
for
20
years?
now
he
has
an
economic
interest
in
the
minerals
in
place.
justice
white
and
he
gets...
what
kind
of
depletion
does
he
get?
justice
white
he
gets
percentage
depletion.
what
does
the
landowner
get?
justice
white
under
what
section?
justice
white
all
right.
what
if
we
ruled
in
this
case,
having
decided
the
very
case
we
just
described,
we
said,
well
this
case
that
we
now
have
before
us,
this
swank
case,
is
exactly
like
that
one.
we
looked
at
all
the
facts
here,
and
it's
just
like
having
a
lease
for
20
years.
justice
white
well,
then,
what
have
we
said
now?
what
about
the
effect
on
the
landowner
then?
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
designed
to
let
him
recover
his
capital
in
a?
justice
white
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
that
was
the
conventional
purpose,
to
take
the
place
of
depletion?
justice
white
and
so,
to
the
extent
that
someone
else
gets
depletion,
well,
at
least
i
wouldn't
suppose
that
people
ought
to
get
depletion
on
the
same
assets?
justice
white
on
the
same
interest?
justice
white
which
is
negotiated,
i
suppose,
on
some
assumptions
about
depletion?
justice
white
you're
talking
about
the
cost
of
the
mineral
to
him,
in
place?
justice
white
you
say
that's
just
another
lawyer's
opinion
then?
justice
white
it
doesn't
come
from
the
secretary,
though.
justice
white
it
doesn't
come
from
the
secretary
or
the
commissioner.
justice
white
but
all
your
mining
and
sales
costs
are
deductible.
justice
white
what's
the
justification
for
depleting
that
mineral
in
place?
justice
white
where
did
percentage
depletion
come
from?
that
just
didn't
come
off
some
tree
somewhere.
congress
had
some
purpose
in--
justice
white
--then
you
had
cost
completion.
justice
white
and
that
was
very
complicated.
justice
white
well,
they
have
the
same
sorts
of
figures
for
all
the
minerals,
don't
they?
justice
white
and
it
is
a
rough
approximation
of
the
rate
as
which
some
resource
is
being
depleted?
justice
white
there's
another
drive,
and
that
is
to
promote
exploration
and
discovery.
