mr.
leroy
katz
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
we
are
exactly
at
odds
with
the
statements
which
have
been
made
by
the
government
in
this
case.
he
is
wrong
in
stating
that
the
lessor
gets,
besides
capital
gains,
gets
cost
depletion.
it's
just
not
true,
your
honors.
section
631
specifically
says
that
the
lessor
shall
no
longer
get
any
depletion
and
in
its
place
the
lessor
will
get
capital
gains
on
the
royalties
which
he
receives.
mr.
leroy
katz
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
leroy
katz
--yes.
mr.
leroy
katz
to
take
the
place
of
depletion;
that's
right.
they--
mr.
leroy
katz
--absolutely...
on
the
same
asset,
but
not
on
the
same...
not
get
the
same
depletion--
mr.
leroy
katz
--yes,
sir,
on
the
same
interest.
and
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
situation,
your
honor.
you
see,
in
a
lease
he
gets
a
royalty.
that's
what--
mr.
leroy
katz
--that's
correct.
mr.
leroy
katz
no,
sir.
well--
mr.
leroy
katz
--the
intricacies
of
the
market
determine
whether
or
not
a
lessor
is
going
to
lease
his
property
to
a
lessee
and
what
the
royalty
rate
will
be.
now,
when
he
has
to
figure
what
his
capital
gain
is,
he
has
to
figure
his
cost
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
if
you
bought
a
piece
of
machinery
and
later
sold
it,
to
see
whether
you
had
a
capital
gain
you
have
to
figure
his
cost.
that
is
what
the
government
in
its
631(c)
statute
say,
that
they
must
figure
their
cost
and
then
take
capital
gains
on
it.
but
the
important
thing
is--
mr.
leroy
katz
--yes,
if,
for
example,
if
you
had
paid
for
your
property
$100,000,
for
example,
and
then
you
had
a
million
tons
of
coal
in
that
property,
and
then
you
leased
it
to
a
lessee,
your
unit
cost
in
that
is
a
million
divided
by
a
hundred
thousand,
ten
cents;
ten
cents
a
ton.
and
then,
if
you
go
from
there
and
see
what
the
lessee,
how
many
tons
he
mines
and
the
royalty
that
he
gets
from
that,
you
can
figure
what
your
cost
is,
and
based
upon
that
cost
then
you
determine
what
your
capital
gain
is.
but
the
important
thing
is,
your
honor,
is
that
leaves
nothing...
we
do
not
describe
what
the
lessee
is
to
get.
you
see,
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
is
based
upon
gross
income
from
mining.
so
that
means,
what
is
the
coal
sold
for
on
the
market
and
what
did
the
lessee,
who
had
the
absolute
right,
as
soon
as
he
cut
that
coal
out
of
the
mountain
and
as
soon
as
he
brought
it
in
and
had
it
cleaned,
he
had
to
sell
it;
he
was
responsible
for
it.
he
had
to
take
the
risk
of
the
loss,
he
had
all
of
the
obligations
of
an
owner.
and
he
had
to
sell
that
coal.
now,
for
example,
you
give
the
lessor
25
cents.
according
to
his
theory,
that's
all
there
is
in
the
way
of
depletion.
not
so.
if
the
lessee
sells
that
coal
for,
say,
$30
a
ton,
his
depletion
is
based
upon
that
$30
a
ton
less
the
25
cents
that
he
gave
to
the
lessor.
now,
that
is
the
depletion
that
we're
talking
about.
and
the
government
would
say
that,
no,
that's
not
right.
we
say
it
can't
be
any
other
way,
your
honors.
it
cannot
be
any
other
way.
we
have
lost
the
depletion
allowance,
and
we
say
that
nobody...
and
i
repeat,
what
we're
talking
about
here,
and
what
we
have
been
denied
by
their
appeal...
we
were
granted
in
the
court
of
claims...
what
we
have
been
denied
is
the
percentage
depletion
which
is
based
upon
the
gross
income
from
the
mining
of
that
coal,
which
we
did
in
every
taxable
year
in
this
case.
that
includes
swank,
that
includes
bull
run,
and
it
includes
black
hawk.
now
you
tell
me
why
we
are
not
entitled
to
that
depletion
allowance
which
the
federal
government,
by
virtue
of
this
congress,
has
given
us,
and
said
we
are
entitled
to
it?
no
one
else,
and
i
repeat
it
again,
no
one
else
can
claim
that
depletion,
and
no
one
else
will
get
it
if
we
don't.
and
that's
true
of
swank,
of
course,
because
the
governmental
agency
in
northumberland
county
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
it.
but
it
is
also
true
in
bull
run
and
it
is
true
in
black
hawk.
mr.
leroy
katz
no,
there's
no
such
regulation
as
that,
your
honor.
what
he
is
talking
about
was
a
general
counsel's
memorandum
which
came
out
in
1950
and
which
they
have
now
abandoned.
general
counsel's
memorandums
do
not
have
the
force
of
regulations;
they
don't
have
the
force
of
a
revenue
ruling;
they
are
just
an
opinion
from
the
general
counsel's
office
and
they
are
not
the
law.
mr.
leroy
katz
absolutely
not,
no,
sir.
and
i
might
add
this,
that
i
was
in
the
bakertown
case
in
the
court
of
claims,
which
we
won,
and
which
the
government
did
not
appeal.
that
was
in
1973.
from
1973
on
to
this
date,
to
this
very
date,
the
government
has
made
no
attempt
to
put
a
regulation
in
explaining
what
they
think
of.
they
have
withdrawn
the
gcm
that
the
government
contends
is
their
rule
of
thumb.
why
they
withdrew
it
i
don't
know,
but
it's
gone.
mr.
leroy
katz
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
it
does
not
have
the
power
of
a
regulation
or
revenue
ruling.
and
of
course
the
regulation
is
the
next
thing
to
law,
but...
and
of
course
that
can
be
objected
to
too,
but
that
has
the...
powerful
act.
but
we
don't
have
it.
it's
been
withdrawn,
so
that
shows
you
what
you
can
do
with
the
general
counsel's
memorandum.
but
after
one
year--
mr.
leroy
katz
--well,
it's
an
important
opinion
because
it
comes
from
the
general
counsel,
but
it
does
not
have
the
force
of
law
and
doesn't
have
the--
mr.
leroy
katz
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leroy
katz
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
and
assuredly,
your
honor,
that
under
those
circumstances
we've
also
got
to
remember,
as
far
as...
the
government
in
its
brief
has
been
arguing
that
this
depletion
allowance
is
what
the
lessor
is
entitled
to
and
what
he
gets.
no
such
thing.
he
gets
no
depletion
allowance.
now,
i
also
want
to
call
the
court'
attention
to
the
fact,
to
strengthen
it,
that
under
the
depletion
deduction...
under
section
611,
it
says
this:
"no
depletion
deduction"...
no
depletion
deduction...
"shall
be
allowed
the
owner
with
respect
to
any
coal.
"
--i'm
leaving
out
the
other
minerals...
"that
such
owner
has
disposed
of
under
any
form
of
contract
by
virtue
of
which
he
retains
an
economic
interest
in
such
coal,
if
such
disposal
is
considered
a
sale
of
the
coal
under
section
631(c).
"
now,
how
he
can
say
that
they
are
going
to
get
some
depletion,
the
owner,
under
631
is
beyond
me,
because
i'm
just
reading
it
right
cut
of
the
book.
mr.
leroy
katz
that's
right.
mr.
leroy
katz
oh,
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
leroy
katz
well,
but...
that's
just
the
method
of
figuring
the...
he
gets
a
better
deal,
your
honor--
mr.
leroy
katz
--well...
no,
he
did
not.
but
in
his
brief
he
used
those
terms
that
the
owner
was
entitled
to
the
depletion
in
this
case,
and
this
case
involves
percentage
depletion,
does
not
involve
cost
depletion.
mr.
leroy
katz
no,
sir,
he
does
not.
mr.
leroy
katz
now,
he
says
there's
no
difference
between
a
lease
and
a
contract.
let
me
say
this.
we
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
distinction
between
what
we
have
here
and
what
we
have
in
paragon
jewel,
which
was
also
my
case.
your
honor,
in
paragon
jewel
we
had
a
contractor
who
was
mining
coal
for
the
lessee.
and
i
might
say
this,
in
the...
i'm
not
accusing
him
of
trying
to
confuse
the
court,
but
he
kept
saying
in
his
brief--
mr.
leroy
katz
--oh,
all
right.
anyhow,
the
contractor
in
that
case
was
mining
the
coal
for
the
lessee.
he
was...
he
did
not
depend
upon
what
the
lessee
got
for
the
coal
on
the
open
market.
he
was
paid
a
certain
amount
per
ton.
he
was
required
to
bring
the
coal
to
the
lessee's
tipple.
he
was
required
to
give
it
to
the
lessee
who
then
in
turn
sold
it,
and
who
was
responsible
for
what
happened
on
the
market,
whether
he
made
money
or
whether
he
lost
money.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
contractor,
this
court
said,
was
not
entitled
to
any
depletion
allowance.
they
didn't
base
it
on
the
terminability.
he
had
no
economic
interest
in
the
coal
in
place,
because
all
he
was
doing
was
getting
paid
for
work
which
he
performed
and
before
he
walked
into
that
mine
he
knew
exactly
how
much
he
was
going
to
get
for
every
ton
of
coal
he
pulled
out,
irrespective
of
what
the
lessee,
paragon,
got
in
that
case.
now,
that's
the
difference.
but,
now,
here
the
government
has
conceded
that
we
have
a
valid
lease.
the
government
concedes
that
absent
this
termination
clause,
that
we
had
all
the
rights,
all
the
privileges,
all
of
the
duties
of
any
lessee.
in
the
case
of
black
hawk,
we
had
to
even
have
a
minimum
royalty.
we
had
to
pay
$5,000
a
year
whether
we
mined
a
ton
of
coal
or
not.
mr.
leroy
katz
all
right,
sir,
in
the
case
of
black
hawk,
we
mined
it
for
13
years,
to
exhaustion.
we
mined
every
drop
of
coal
out.
in
the
case
of
bull
run,
they
mined
it
for
11
years,
and
mined
every
drop
of
coal
out,
to
exhaustion.
it
just
happened
that
way.
in
swank,
there
were
two
leases.
one,
they
had
to
abandon
after
a
year
because
they
had
a
slide;
and
the
other,
they
mined
for
the
two
years
when
it
was
transferred
to
someone
else.
but
in
each
of
the
instances
that
i
have
named,
we
have
mined
that
coal
through
every
tax
year.
we
think
this
is
an
important
item.
the
question
that
we
have
mined
that
coal
in
the
tax
years
in
issue,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
were
we
entitled
to
the
depletion
allowance
during
the
tax
years
in
issue?
well,
we
mined
it.
why
shouldn't
we
get
it?
it
is
not
like
paragon
where
in
that
case
two
people
were
claiming
the
same
depletion,
the
same
percentage
depletion.
the
miner,
the
contract
miner
said,
i
am
entitled
to
it
on
what
i
got
paid,
which
is
$10.
we
contend
that
the
lessee
was
entitled
to
it
because
he
ran
the
risk
of
the
market,
and
that
he
had
the
economic
interest
in
the
coal
in
place.
so,
that
was
the
difference
between
the
two,
and
between
what
we
have
here
and
what
we
had
in
paragon.
mr.
leroy
katz
absolutely,
yes.
because,
let
me
explain
why,
though,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
katz
well,
i
mean,
you've
got
to
remember
something
about
percentage
depletion.
it's
not
a
right
that
you
get
just
by
signing
the
lease,
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
can
go
and
take
a
deduction.
first
of
all,
you've
got
to
mine
the
coal.
mr.
leroy
katz
secondly,
you've
got
to
sell
it.
and,
most
importantly,
you've
got
to
sell
it
at
a
profit.
and
if
you
don't
combine
all
of
those
three
factors,
you
don't
get
a
dime's
worth
of
percentage
depletion.
mr.
leroy
katz
yes.
well,
the
calculation
for
percentage
depletion
tell
you
how
to
calculate
it.
mr.
leroy
katz
shown
costs
are
deducted,
yes.
mr.
leroy
katz
because
the
statutes
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
it.
we
get
a
ten
percent--
mr.
leroy
katz
--it
came
this
way.
at
first,
way
back
there,
in
the
early
years,
in
1918
and
before,
we
had
what
was
called
discovery
depletion.
mr.
leroy
katz
and
then
came
the
cost
depletion.
mr.
leroy
katz
yes.
and
now
we're...
then
we
came
to
percentage
depletion,
and
the
congress
just
said
that
for
coal
we're
going
to
give
you
ten
percent.
mr.
leroy
katz
yes.
mr.
leroy
katz
well,
they
don't
say
that.
mr.
leroy
katz
well,
i
can't
say
that
that
is
the
theory
that
it
would
be
ten
years
because
i
don't
believe
it
has
any
relation.
mr.
leroy
katz
i
don't
believe
that
the
congress--
mr.
leroy
katz
--well,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
well,
they'd
have
to
say--
mr.
leroy
katz
--every
mineral
has
a
different--
mr.
leroy
katz
--well,
let
me
say
this,
your
honor--
mr.
leroy
katz
--no,
that's
correct.
and
they
didn't
in
the
case
of
coal,
for
example.
it
used
to
be
five
percent.
mr.
leroy
katz
it
wasn't
the
theory
that
they
later
said,
well,
it
ought
to
be
ten
percent
because
they
could
mine
it
more
quickly.
i
don't
believe
that's...
i
think
it
is
just
political.
mr.
leroy
katz
not
related
to
cost
at
all.
there's
no
relation.
mr.
leroy
katz
yes.
it's
to
promote
discovery,
your
honor,
and
it's
to
reimburse
the
one
who
has
to
mine
that
coal
for
the
capital
which
he
expends.
i
mean,
this
court
has
said--
mr.
leroy
katz
--yes,
that's
correct.
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
in
this
case,
it's
ten
percent,
but
it's
not
just
ten
percent
flat.
it's
ten
percent
of
the
gross
income
not
to
exceed
50
percent
of
your
net
income
after
you've
figured
out
your
net
income.
so
that
is
what
it
is.
contrary
to
what
my
opponent
has
stated
here,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
should
be
given,
to
us.
the
government
is
not
injured
because
the
congress
has
told
us
we
are
entitled
to
that
depletion.
not
only
that,
your
honor,
if
i
may
make
this
point,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
we
mine
ten
tons
or
a
million
tons,
is
this
court
going
to
get
into
this
debate
that
we
have
now
in
the
tax
court?
they
have
said,
no;
30
days
is
not
enough;
60
days
is
not
enough;
they
have
just
come
out
with
a
case
in
which
they
say,
well,
120
days
is.
now,
is
this
court
going
to
say,
well,
we're
going
to
fix
a
year
or
five
years
or
six
months,
is
that
the
job
of
this
court?
why
isn't
the
government
asking
for,
one,
legislation,
or
two,
to
put
down
some
regulations
that
we
know
how
to
follow?
and
we
feel
that
unless
they
do
that
they
should
not
bring
us
into
court
every
time
they
decide
that
they
don't
want
to
give
out
the
depletion
allowance.
we've
fought
it
in
parsons
v.
smith.
we
had
to
fight
in
paragon
jewel.
i
fought
it
in
