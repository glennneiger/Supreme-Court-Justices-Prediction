justice

no,
were
offering
them
ten
percent
when
they
get
paid
according
to
scale.
justice
stevens
and
isn't
it
almost
inevitable
that
that
would
happen,
that
the
agents
would
begin
collecting
commissions
when
their
clients
were
being
paid
scale?
justice
stevens
that's
what
you're
complaining
about,
so
i
assume--
justice
stevens
--don't
we
have
to
presume
that
if
you
prevail
some,
at
least
some
agents
will
start
collecting
some
commissions
when
their
clients
work
for
scale?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
inevitable.
now,
if
that
happens,
it
seems
to
me
there's
going
to
be
more
money
flowing
into
agents'
pockets
and
more
competition
for
these
jobs.
isn't
that
almost
inevitable?
justice
stevens
there
may
be
more
agents,
too.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
saying
it's
inequitable.
i'm
not
arguing
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
are
asking
that
the
market
be
opened
up.
that's
the
theory
of
your
case.
justice
stevens
it
means
you
are
asking
for
more
competition.
now,
whether--
justice
stevens
what
do
the
personal
managers
do?
do
they
get
employment
for
their
clients?
justice
stevens
but
then
they're
really
not
comparable
to
agents.
at
least,
their
principal
function
is
not
to
find
jobs
and
so
forth.
justice
stevens
they
are
sort
of
like
a
teacher
or
something
like
that,
would
you
say?
justice
stevens
--would
it
be
legal
if
the
agreement
provided
that
the
costs
of
operating
the
hiring
hall
be
paid
by
the
employers?
justice
stevens
mr.
lurie,
would
your
theory
make
it
appropriate
for
a
union
to
franchise
acting
teachers?
justice
stevens
because
isn't
it
inevitably
true
that
when
you
don't
allow
that
to
happen,
there
are
fewer
agents?
justice
stevens
so
it
is
not
in
your
interest
to
maximize
the
number
of
agents.
justice
stevens
well,
but
isn't
it
simple
economics,
as
i
suggested
to
your
learned
opponent,
that
if
you
cut
off
one
major
source
of
income
into
the
industry,
namely,
commissions
on
people
who
work
at
scale,
and
lots
of
people
work
at
scale,
don't
they?
there'll
be
less
money
available
to
pay
agents
and
obviously
there'll
be
fewer
agents.
justice
stevens
i
was
questioning
your
argument
that
you
desired
to
increase
competition.
i
thought
your
argument
is
that
you
have
a
perfect
legal
right
to
suppress
competition,
because
you're
surely
doing
that.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
more
question.
there's
a
question,
what's
an
exorbitant
commission?
i
guess
in
the
view
of
the
union,
anytime
an
actor
nets
less
than
scale
because
he
pays
the
commission,
he
pays
an
exorbitant
commission.
justice
stevens
mr.
lurie,
before
you
sit
down,
just
as
a
matter
of
personal
curiosity,
how
old
a
union
is
equity?
justice
stevens
mr.
gold,
i
wanted
to
ask
perhaps
two
questions.
justice
stevens
the
question,
i
guess,
then
is
whether
the
agents
are
in...
in
which
market
are
the
agents
placed?
