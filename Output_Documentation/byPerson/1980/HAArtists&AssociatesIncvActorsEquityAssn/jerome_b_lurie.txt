mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court:
equity
is
a
union
of
approximately
23,000
members.
they
work
throughout
the
country,
not
just
in
new
york
state,
and
they
are
engaged,
or
seeking
employment,
throughout
the
country
in
the
legitimate
theater.
at
any
one
time
the
overwhelming
majority
of
equity
members
are
unemployed.
they
are
constantly
seeking
employment
and
there
was
a
finding
in
the
district
court
that
producers
as
a
general
practice
seek
actors
through
agents
and
actors
who
do
not
have
agents
do
not
have
the
same
access
to
employment
as
actors
who
do
have
agents.
as
a
consequence
of
the--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--it
may
be
that
it
is
true
in
some
instances,
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
there
were
a
union
in
a
similar
position
where
the
actors
could
only
get
jobs
through
certain
specific
employment
agencies,
that
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
do
something
about
it.
for
example,
a
union
i
know
in
the
restaurant
industry
in
new
york
signed
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
all
the
employers
which
said
that
employees
could
only
be
engaged
through
the
new
york
state
employment
service,
because
they
didn't
want
their
members
who
would
be
hired
for
jobs
to
pay
employment
agency
fees.
they
were
protecting,
in
that
case,
it
seems
to
me,
the
minimum
wage.
unions
in
other
industries
solve
this
problem
by
establishing
a
hiring
hall.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
what
they
have
done,
if
your
honor
please,
is
limit
commissions
to
ten
percent.
that
is
not
all
that
we
do
in
this
situation.
secondly,
even
though
they
have
limited
commissions
to
ten
percent,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that's
no
reason
why
the
union
should
not
utilize
its
best
efforts
to
see
to
it
that
the
actors
do
not
have
to
pay
unreasonable
commissions.
the
fact
that
the
state
has
legislated
doesn't
mean
that
we
can't
act.
the
state
legislating
doesn't
make
something
that
would
be
legal
if
they
had
not
legislated
illegal
because
they
did
legislate.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
that's
right.
in
addition,
if
your
honor
please,
these
agents
operate
not
just
in
new
york
city,
although
the
bulk
of
them
are
in
new
york
city
and
some
of
them
are
in
los
angeles,
but
they
operate
throughout
the
country,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
which
indicates
that
all
states
throughout
the
country
where
actors
perform
in
the
legitimate
theater
have
the
same
rules
and
regulations.
but
we
do
license
or
franchise
agents
throughout
the
country.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
enter
into
such
an
agreement
with
the
producers.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
but
because
of
peculiarities
of
this
industry--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
than
this?
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
it
would
be
exempt
under
the
antitrust
laws.
hiring--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--no
more
and
no
less.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
yes.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
well,
i
think
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
often
ruled
in
this
matter
that
if
the
employers
contribute
toward
the
hiring
hall
an
amount
which
relates,
or,
for
example,
an
employee,
those
hiring
halls
have
to
be
without
discrimination
and
any
individual
theoretically
can
walk
in
and
be
sent
out,
and
he
can
be
charged
a
fee
commensurate
with
the
cost
of
operating
his
share
of
the
hiring.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
well,
if
your
honor
please,
absolutely.
i
mean,
the
circuit
court
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
found
that
although
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
cost
of
the
operation,
that
there
was
one
full-time
employee
and
other
people
involved,
and
that
as
$12,000
was
the
total
that
was
paid
by
the
agents,
that
it
clearly
was
commensurate
with
the
cost
of
the
operation.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
no,
it
would
not,
if
your
honor
please.
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
had
that
question
come
up
the
other
day
in
a
different
way.
there
are
a
group
of
casting
agents
in
new
york
who
cast
for
various
theaters,
like
the
public
theater
and
other
theaters
which
are
constantly
casting,
and
those
casting
agents
have
been
giving
courses,
they
are
teaching
courses
on
how
to
audition.
and
there
has
been
a
tremendous
uproar
in
equity
because
the
equity
members
say,
in
order
to
get
jobs
in
the
theaters
where
these
people
cast,
you
have
to
take
the
course
of
the
casting
agent.
and
of
course,
it
came
up,
did
we
have
a
right
to
do
anything
about
that?
and
i
said
to
the
union,
very
explicitly,
we
do
not
have
a
right.
so
we
can
tell
our
members,
you
may
not
go
to
those
courses
if
you
don't
want
to,
and
we
will
possibly
discipline
you
for
going
to
those
courses,
but
you
have
no
right
to
take
any
action
against
the
casting
directors.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
if
your
honor
please,
disciplining
our
members
means
anything
which
is
permissible
and
reasonable
under
the
internal...
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
of
the
union.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
yes.
i
would
say
we
could
fine;
we
might
have
some
problem
in
expulsion,
there
are
various...
but
i'm
really
not
prepared
to
discuss
that
aspect
at
this
moment.
but
i
think
you
could
take
any
usual,
normal
union
disciplinary
action.
we
could
fine
them,
and
indeed
in
this
case,
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
is
quite
clear
that
when
we
were
having
a
dispute
with
the
agents
about
the
rules
that
we
were
going
to
promulgate,
we
informed
our
members...
and
by
the
way,
this
is
the...
there
is
a
finding
in
this
case
by
the
district
court,
not
disturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
there
is
no
combination
between
this
union
and
the
producers
in
an
effort
to
enforce
this
system.
there
is
also
a
finding
in
district
court
that
there
is
no
conspiracy
between
tara
and
the
union.
and
by
the
way,
if
i
may
say
to
the
court--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--the
agency
agreement
does
say,
but
we--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--there
is
an
agreement,
if
your
honor
please,
but
let
me
say,
number
one,
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
anybody
or
any
agent
who
is
prepared
to
meet
and
conform
with
the
regulations
cannot
be
licensed.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
well,
let
me
say
that--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--yes,
i
would
think
that
that
would
change
the
situation.
i
don't
think
that
situation
could
ever
come
about
because
it
is
the
interest
of
equity
to
have
as
many
agents
as
possible,
and
have
as
many
members
represented
by
agents.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
well,
if
your
honor--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--well,
i
suppose
that
it
is
possible.
there
is
certainly
no
evidence--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--if
your
honor
please,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
i
know
of
that
any
agent
has
ever
been
denied
access...
has
not
come
into
the
agency
business
because
of
that,
or
that
any
agent
has
ever
dropped
out
because
of
that.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it
is...
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
think
it's
clear
in
the
theatrical
industry
that
people
work
for
scale
actors
not
because
they
want
to.
indeed,
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
any
agent
to
take
any
actor
on
as
client.
they
work
for
scale
actors
because
they
figure
that
if
they
catch
al
pacino
when
he's
doing
"the
indian
wants
the
bronx"
off
broadway,
that
several
years
later
al
pacino
is
going
to
be
making
a
million
dollars
a
picture
and
they're
going
to
get
ten
percent
of
that.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
although
there
may
be
some
correlation
between
what
you
postulated,
and
i
would
say
that
logic
probably
supports
it,
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect,
and
further,
that
most
of
these
agents
do
not
work
just
in
the
theater.
a
lot
of
agents
work
in
the
theater,
as
he
indicated,
in
the
motion
picture
business,
and
in
connection
with
radio
and
television.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
didn't
say
we
didn't
have
a
right
to
do
this.
i
said,
really
what
i
was
saying
is
that
it
is
in
the
interest
of
equity,
and
they
do
a
balancing,
just
as
this
court
does
often,
between
the
problem
of
regulating
the
agents
and
protecting
their
members,
and
protecting
them
from
abuses.
you
know,
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
before
that
there
were
no
abuses.
well,
these
regulations
have
been
in
effect
since
1928,
but
the
history
of
what
happened
prior
to
1928
is
replete
with
abuses.
in
the
edelstein
case
in
the
2nd
circuit,
there
were
affidavits
which
indicated
all
sorts
of
problems
including
excessive
commissions
and
so
on.
and
what
petitioner
is
arguing
is
that
because
these--
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
--well,
if
your
honor
please,
first,
what
happened
was
that
equity
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
abuses
which
were
so
prevalent
lobbied
for
the
passage
of
the
new
york
state
law.
when
it
was
passed
there
were
finding
that
it
was
not
being
effectively
enforced.
they
found,
for
example,
that
under
the
new
york
state
law
it
was
quite
easy
for
somebody,
an
agent,
to
say,
well,
when
you
sign
with
us
you've
got
to
give
us
a
bonus.
and
if
you
get
a
job,
we'd
like
you
to
give
us
a
christmas
present.
and
this
was...
in
the
record
the
joint
appendix
here,
you
will
see
an
excerpt
from
"the
revolt
of
the
actors"
which
does
state
just
that.
it
is
also
true
that
having
found
that
under
this
court's
decision
the
jersey
law
was
not
going
to
be
enforced,
and
everybody
thought
it
would
apply
to
the
new
york
law,
then
equity
really
went
to
town
and
set
up
these
regulations.
but
there
were
abuses
before
the
regulations
and
to
condemn
or
say
something
is
not
necessary
because
it
succeeded
in
its
objectives
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
two...
correct.
our
position
is
that
we
have
negotiated
this
contract
and
this
scale
for
the
actor.
for
example,
traditionally,
in
the
business,
chorus
kids,
the
chorus
actors,
never
have
commissioned
an
agent
because
there
isn't
anything
an
agent
can
do
for
them.
they
can't
find
access
to
jobs
for
them
and
they
can't
get
them
any
more
than
the
minimum
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that's
it.
we
think
that
anything
which
invades
the
minimum
that
we
struggled
to
fight
for
and
that
we've
gotten
for
them
is
excessive.
we
also
think
anything
in
excess
of
the
regulations
are
excessive,
and
we
feel
that
if
we
are
within
the
statutory
exemption,
that
we
have
a
right
to
set
these
rules.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
equity
was
formed
around
the
turn
of
the
century.
it's
about...
i
think
it
was
1914...
around...
that's
not
the
turn...
around
1914,
there
was
a
group
called
the
white
rats
who
organized
the
union.
they
were
a
bunch
of
actors
who...
actors
had
been
terribly
depressed.
i
mean,
without
a
union,
the
strange
thing
about
this
profession
is
that
they
beg
you
for
the
right
to
work
for
nothing,
and
one
of
the
big
struggles
equity
has
with
its
members
is
to
say,
you
may
not
do
this.
they
are
so
desperate
to
work.
they
are
performers
and
they
want
to
be
seen.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
that
old.
mr.
jerome
b.
lurie
actors'
equity
association;
i
think
so.
they
were
originally
called
the
white
rats,
and
that
was
the
group
that
organized
equity.
