justice
rehnquist
mr.
breindel,
before
you
get
to
that,
am
i
correct
in
thinking
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
finding
as
to
whether
this
conduct
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
act?
justice
rehnquist
it
simply
went
directly
to
the
labor
exemption
without
determining
whether
the
conduct
would
be
actionable
under
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
rehnquist
is
it
rather
they
are
licensed
under
the
general
new
york
law
of
regulating
kickbacks
by
employment
agencies?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
it
a
type
of
law
such
as
that
that
was
originally
invalidated
in
the
'20s
by
the
case
of
ribnik
v.
mcbride--
justice
rehnquist
--and
then
later,
of
that
case
being
later
overruled
by
the
olson
case?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
true
of
a
lot
of
employment
agencies,
or
rather
employers
seeking
employees
through
employment
agencies,
entirely
outside
of
the
actors'
field?
justice
rehnquist
the
state
of
new
york
has
addressed
it
too,
has
it
not,
by
limiting
the
amount,
or
prohibiting
any
kickbacks
to
the
employer
from
the
employment
agency?
justice
rehnquist
right.
the
state
legislation
doesn't
prohibit
an
employment
agency
from
charging
only
five
percent
or
zero
percent,
does
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
it
would
be
prohibited
in
an
open
shop
state,
would
it
not?
it
probably
would
be,
but
that's
a
question
for
the
labor
laws--
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
disciplining
your
members
meant
imposition
of
a
fine
such
as--
justice
rehnquist
--and
under
our
boeing
decision
which
leaves
the
substantiality
of
the
fine
to
the
state
courts?
justice
rehnquist
wasn't
that
partly
because
this
court
had
then
held
that
new
york
state
couldn't
regulate
employment
agencies,
or
agents?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
what
about
the
fact
in
carroll
that
the
orchestra
leaders
there
actually
played
as
musicians
with
the
dance
bands?
do
you
regard
that
as
a
distinction
of
no
significance?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say,
if
this
system
were
suspect,
the
presence
of
the
fee
might
render
it--
justice
rehnquist
--but
here
the
employer
doesn't--
justice
rehnquist
--actually,
neither
are
express
statutory
exemptions.
they
are
referred
to
in
the
terminology
of--
justice
rehnquist
--one
is
no
more
express
than
the
other,
though?
justice
rehnquist
could
i
ask
you
one...
do
you
think
all
decisions
to
move
from
new
york
to
the
west
coast
are
motivated
by
actors'
equity
practices?
