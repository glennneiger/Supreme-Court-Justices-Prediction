mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
that
mr.
lurie
has
expressed
indicates
why
all
of
us
on
the
union
side
of
this
issue
believe
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
carroll.
the
court
in
that
instance
addressed
itself
to
the
use
of
booking
agents
by
musicians
and
the
situation
faced
by
all
of
the
theatrical
unions
is
roughly
the
same.
it
is
a
situation
in
which
work
is
intermittent,
in
which
there
are
many
more
competitors
for
jobs
than
there
are
jobs,
and
where
the
traditional
pattern
is
that
there
is
an
intermediary
between
the
purchaser
of
labor
and
those
people
who
are
offering
themselves
for
employment.
mr.
laurence
gold
for
the
purpose
here
we
think
it
is
irrelevant
because
carroll
concerned
many
issues
and
one
issue
was
the
extent
to
which
you
could,
to
which
the
union
could
regulate
the
orchestra
leaders.
another
issue
was
the
extent
to
which
you
could
regulate
booking
agents
and
that
booking
agents
question
was
dealt
with
separately.
indeed
we
think
the
question
here
is
somewhat
easier
because
all
of
the
individuals
who
are
in
competition
for
these
jobs
are
true
employees.
the
question
is
whether
when
you
have
this
two-step
process
of
getting
a
job,
first
to
get
an
agent
and
then
to
get
the
employment,
the
union
is
limited
to
only
dealing
with
the
person
offering
the
job
or
can
regulate
that
intermediary
stage,
and
we
believe
that
if
the
union
can
only
sign
the
collective
agreement
and
get
scale
in
this
set-up
where
there
is
a
two-step
process,
it
can't
do
its
job,
because--
mr.
laurence
gold
--that
point
is
treated
in
the
brief
of
the
union,
and
the
record
in
the
carroll
case
shows
that
there
were
collective
agreements
in
the
steady
engagement
field
in
carroll,
and
that
was
covered
by
musicians'
booking
agents'
rules
just
as
the
rest
of
the
engagements
were
covered.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
carroll
made
absolutely
no
distinction.
this
was
the
point
that
was
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
every
one
of
the
efforts
that
the
petitioners
make
to
distinguish
carroll
fail.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
my
view
on
the
fee
is
that
if
the
rest
of
the
system
were
in
any
way
suspect
that
might
not
stand,
but
if
we
are
correct
that
the
whole
point
and
purpose
of
the
system
is
employee
protective,
we
certainly
believe
that
the
fee
which
barely
covers
the
cost
of
the
system
would
be
lawful.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
part.
mr.
laurence
gold
let
me...
you
raised
the
question,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
laurence
gold
--no,
i
would
agree
entirely.
but
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
in
a
hiring
hall
situation
the
employer
pays.
the
norm
is
that
the
employer
pays.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
if
the
system
were
otherwise
no
good,
and
i
was
trying
to
defend
the
charging
of
the
fee
for
a
system
which
was
otherwise
not
in
the
labor
exemption,
i
don't
think
i
could
succeed
on
that
point
standing
alone.
but
i
do
argue
to
you
that
if
the
whole
point
and
purpose
of
the
system
isn't
proper
under
carroll
and
within
the
labor
exemption,
i
don't
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
cost
of
the
system
is
shared
by
the
union
and
the
employer
invalidates
the
system
or
even
invalidates
that
one
provision
any
more
than
i
believe
that
a
perfectly
lawful
hiring
hall
could
possibly
be
invalidated
under
the
long-standing
practice
that
it's
the
employer
who
pays
the
cost
of
the
hall
either
in
whole
or
in
part.
mr.
laurence
gold
because
if
it's
the
employer
who
pays,
or
it
isn't
the
agents
who
pay
in
this
instance,
then
it's
the
members
who
pay.
and
that
ultimately
is
subject,
if
you're
in
the
labor
market
area,
which
is
settled
by
the
back-and-forth
between
the
varying
groups
depending
on
their
economic
strength
and
not
by
the
law.
mr.
laurence
gold
i'm
not
positive
where
the
line
is
but
i
can
indicate
what
we
think
the
theory
is,
and
what
we
understand
the
basic
point
of
the
labor
exemption
to
be.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
basic
point
of
the
labor
exemption
is
that
there
are
two
different
systems
that
congress
has
decreed.
one
is
the
antitrust
system
which
regulates
product
markets,
and
business
markets
in
general.
the
other
is
a
system
where
employees
are
permitted
to
combine
to
protect
themselves
against
job
and
wage
competition
in
the
labor
market.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
would
seem
to
me
that
was
certainly
stretching
the
concept
of
the
employees'
labor
market
to
its
very
end.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
correct,
but
in
this
instance
what
we
rely
on
very
heavily
is
that
we're
in
the
heart
and
soul
of
these
employees'
job
market.
the
findings
are
that
the
agent
stands
between
the
employee
and
the
job.
he
is
the
means.
in
that
situation
we
believe
that
no
matter
how
you
cut
this,
whether
you
do
it
under
the
statutory
exemption
or
you
do
it
under
the
non-statutory
exemption,
that
the
union
is
regulating
the
matter
of
immediate
and
direct
concern.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
think
they're
all
express.
congress
has
been
at
this
for
some
time.
there's
section
6;
there's
section
2.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
they
are
equal.
i
guess
i
would
put
that
affirmatively
that
they
are
equally,
but
plainly
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
hutcheson
and
as
mr.
justice
powell
said
in
connell,
the
basic
task
here
is
harmonizing
these
two
different
systems,
reading
these
series
of
laws
together
in
a
way
that
makes
sense,
and
the
basic
point
that
we
think
has
emerged
from
all
of
that
jurisprudence
is
that
if
the
union
is
regulating
the
matter
of
direct
and
immediate
concern
and
its
employees'
job
market,
that
is
within
the
labor
exemption,
obviously.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
depends
on
the
test
you
apply
to
determine
what
the
meaning
of
the
labor
exemption
is.
it's
not
absolutely
plain
that
the
labor
exemption
permits
unions
to
do
absolutely
anything.
mr.
laurence
gold
tara.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
we
would
have
to
show
that
the
union
was
operating
to
advance
a
direct
and
immediate
interest.
i
don't
know
how,
on
the
facts
you
give
we
would
possibly
show
it.
the
point
though
is
that
if
we
are
operating
to
advance
a
direct
and
immediate
interest,
it
appears
to
us
that
the
fact
that
there
is
an
effect
on
a
business
market
cannot
be
sufficient
to
invalidate
our
system
because
if
that's
true,
then
there's
nothing
left
of
congress's
determination
that
the
labor
market
can
be
regulated
in
this
way.
there'll
always
be
an
effect.
the
jewel
tea--
mr.
laurence
gold
--yes.
i
can
think
of
at
least
two
occasions
on
which
it's
been
made,
one
of
which
was
alluded
to
from
the
bench.
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
jewel
tea
has
been
the
theme
on
which
i've
been
addressing
variations.
i
also--
mr.
laurence
gold
--i
read
his
opinion
to
say,
if
the
issue
is
of
direct
and
immediate
union
concern,
and
there
the
direct
and
immediate
union
labor
market
concern
was
the
desire
of
those
employees
not
to
work
at
night;
the
fact
that
there
is
also
an
effect
on
the
product
market
is
not
sufficient.
and
then
the
contrast
is
if
you
regulate
the
product
market
directly
with
the
hope
that
you
will
get
some
benefit
eventually,
and
the
example
would
be
that
given
in
pennington,
where
the
union
hoped
to
regulate
the
product
market
in
terms
of
who
would
enter
and
who
would
not
in
the
hope
that
eventually
it
could
get
higher
wages.
the
example
i
just
gave
is
an
instance,
and
allen
bradley
would
be
another,
where
the
union
is
outside
the
labor
exemption.
we
believe
the
test
for
determining
when
it's
inside
the
labor
exemption
is
basically
that
i've
just
articulated,
that
the
fact
that
there's
a
consequential
effect
or
an
effect
on
the
product
market
is
not
enough
to
defeat
the
exemption.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
that
some
of
the
academic
commentary
doesn't
do
the
opinions
justice,
necessarily--
mr.
laurence
gold
--i
was
going
to
say
that
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case,
he
notes
that
the
center
of
the
labor
exemption
is
where
the
union
is
attempting
to
regulate
in
order
to
prevent
wage
and
job
competition
among
its
members
in
its
labor
market,
and
we
think
that
that's
important.
after
all,
the
exemption--
mr.
laurence
gold
--well,
you're
going
to
have,
in
effect...
we
make
an
argument,
it's
point
two
of
our
amicus
brief,
that
an
agent
because
he
deals
in
the
services
of
employees
doesn't
really
have
a
product
market
in
the
classic
sense.
but
as
jewel
tea
shows,
you
can
regulate
in
the
labor
market
and
that
has
an
effect
on
the
product
market
as
well;
they
intersect
and
we
think
the
exemption,
our
labor
exemption
does
not
require
that
we
show
that
there's
no
effect
on
the
product
market,
because
if
we
had
to
show
that
we
really
have
to
defend
ourselves
on
the
merits
against
the
antitrust
claim.
after
all,
if
there's
no
effect
on
the
product
market
there's
no
restraint
on
trade.
we
think
what...
it's
sufficient,
given
these
two
schemes,
if
we
show
we're
staying
in
our
basic
area,
and
there
are
only
consequences.
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you
very
much.
