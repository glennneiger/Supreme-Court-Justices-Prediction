justice
blackmun
has
it
always
had
the
name,
equity?
justice
blackmun
mr.
gold,
before
you
sit
down,
you
touched
upon
this
distinction
between
focusing
on
the
labor
market
and
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
product
market.
has
this
court
ever
in
so
many
words
up
to
this
point
made
that
distinction
in
focus?
justice
blackmun
does
his
opinion
really
make
that
distinction?
he
said
even
in
the
product
market
it's
still
all
right,
within
the
exemption,
if
it's
the
least
restrictive
possibility,
as
i
read
it.
justice
blackmun
mr.
gold,
what
is
your
second
case?
--there's
recent
academic
commentary
to
this
effect
that
seems
to
be
emerging.
