mr.
howard
breindel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
which
involves
the
very
difficult
and
complex
interplay
of
our
federal
antitrust
laws
which
promote
competition,
our
federal
labor
laws
which
tend
to
stifle
competition,
and
a
labor
exemption
which
attempts
to
accommodate
these
conflicting
laws.
there
is
very
little
dispute
over
the
basic
operative
facts
here.
equity
is
a
union
whose
23,000
members
include
virtually
every
actor
who
is
allowed
to
appear
on
the
legitimate
stage
in
the
united
states.
petitioners
are
theatrical
agents
located
in
new
york
city.
they
represent
actors
who
belong
to
actors'
equity.
although
they
are
independent
contractors,
the
petitioners
as
agents
perform
services
and
in
effect
work
for
the
actors
who
are
members
of
actor's
equity.
all
of
the
petitioners
are
regulated
and
licensed
as
employment
agencies
under
new
york
state
law.
all
are
members
of
natr,
the
national
association
of
talent
representatives,
a
trade
association
of
theatrical
agents
located
in
new
york
city.
tara
is
a
similar
trade
association
of
theatrical
agents
located
in
new
york
city.
the
members
of
tara
compete
with
the
members
of
natr.
most
of
the
petitioners
are
very
small
agencies.
they
employ
no
more
than
two
or
three
agents
and
they
very
rarely
represent
stars.
tara's
members,
on
the
other
hand,
include
such
industry
giants
as
william
morris,
and
international
creative
management,
each
of
whom
alone
employ
approximately
200
agents.
they
represent
many,
many
stars
and
they
very
rarely
get
a
job
for
one
of
their
clients
at
a
scale
or
minimum
wage.
for
the
last
50
years
or
so
equity's
franchising
rules
have
been
in
effect.
the
rules
were
last
revised
in
october,
1977,
pursuant
to
an
agreement
between
equity
and
tara.
equity
and
tara's
franchise
rules
provide
that
equity
members
cannot
deal
with
non-franchised
agents,
they
provide
the
maximum
commissions
which
equity
agents
may
charge,
they
provide
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
agents
may
charge
commissions.
agents
may
not
charge
commissions
on
a
scale
job,
they
may
not
charge
commission
on
a
chorus
job,
and
they
may
not
charge
commission
on
rehearsal
pay.
mr.
howard
breindel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
breindel
it
isn't
very
likely
because
most
of
the
agents
will
also
place
actors
in
non-equity
jobs,
but
there
are
many
petitioners
who
place
a
lot
of
actors
in
scale
jobs;
scale
jobs
predominate
over
non-scale
jobs.
mr.
howard
breindel
well,
they
will
do
it
for
nothing
because
the
actors
are
their
clients,
they
want
to
accommodate
these
actors,
they
hope
that
maybe
some
day
an
actor
will
become
a
star.
but
the
basic
reason
they
do
it
for
nothing
is--
mr.
howard
breindel
--if
he
stays
with
him.
but
the
basic
reason
why
agents
will
get
actors
scale
jobs
is
they
don't
set
out
to
get
an
actor
a
scale
job.
they
go
to
the
producer
and
they
say,
i
have
a
terrific
actor
for
you.
the
producer
says,
all
right,
but
i'm
only
going
to
pay
you
scale.
well,
the
agent
has
now
gotten
the
producer
interested;
he's
going
to
allow
his
client,
the
actor,
to
have
the
opportunity
to
work
for
scale,
even
though
the
agent
in
his
own
self
interest
tried
to
get
the
actor
above
scale.
the
franchise
rules,
in
addition,
provide
that
all
disputes
between
an
actor
and
an
agent
must
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
they
provide
that
the
union
may
discipline
the
agents.
this
discipline
can
include
fines
of
up
to
$5,000,
forfeiture
of
commissions,
and
revocation
of
the
franchise.
in
addition,
agents
must--
mr.
howard
breindel
--it's
strictly
prohibited.
mr.
howard
breindel
by
the
equity's--
mr.
howard
breindel
--well,
i
believe
it's
prohibited
by
equity's
rules
and
by-laws.
mr.
howard
breindel
well,
i
think
the
basic
reason
is
there's
no
need
for
producers
to
pay
agents.
the
agents
are
knocking
on
the
producers'
door.
equity
has
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
all
theatrical
producers
who
employ
equity
members.
thus
it
has
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
nine
separate
groups
of
producers.
it's
probably
best
known
for
its
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
league
of
new
york
theaters,
which
governs
wages
and
working
conditions
on
broadway.
these
agreements
are
all
negotiated
by
equity
and
the
producers.
the
agents
do
not
participate
in
the
negotiations
for
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
an
actor
is
free
to
negotiate
a
wage
above
the
minimum
set
forth
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
neither
the
actor,
the
producer,
nor
the
agent
may
diminish
the
minimum
or
scale
wage
set
forth
in
an
equity
collective
bargaining
agreement.
under
equity's
system
the
equity
producer
directly
pays
the
equity
actor.
in
addition
the
equity
producer
must
post
a
bond
guaranteeing
payment
of
scale
wages
to
union
members.
the
primary
legal
issue
before
us
today
is
the
applicability
of
the
statutory
labor
exemption
to
equity's
franchising
system.
if
the
agent
is
a
part
of
the
union's
labor
group,
the
statutory
exemption
is
applicable.
under
carroll
independent--
mr.
howard
breindel
--that's
correct.
mr.
howard
breindel
that
is
correct.
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
reached
only
one
issue
and
that
was
the
applicability
of
the
statutory
labor
exemption.
under
carroll,
independent
contractors
such
as
the
theatrical
agents
in
this
case
are
part
of
the
union's
labor
group
if
there
is
present
a
job
or
wage
competition
or
some
other
economic
interrelationship
affecting
a
legitimate
union
interest
between
the
union
member
and
the
actor.
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
carroll,
no
court
had
ever
held
that
a
non-union
member
was
a
part
of
a
labor
group
unless
the
non-union
member
was
in
a
wage
or
job
competition,
or
performed
basically
the
same
function
as
the
union
member.
in
carroll,
for
the
first
time,
the
court
held
that
a
non-union
member
who
was
not
in
a
wage
or
job
competition
could
be
part
of
the
union's
labor
group.
mr.
howard
breindel
i
believe
so.
it's
our
position
that
carroll
is
a
very
unique
decision
which
should
be
confined
to
peculiar
facts.
in
carroll
the
supreme
court
was
dealing
with
the
afm's
activities
in
the
unusual
one-shot
club
date
music
field.
the
primary
purpose
of
unions
is
the
negotiation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
nevertheless,
in
the
club
date
music
industry
there
are
no
collective
bargaining
agreements.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
and
the
unions
haven't
cited
any
exceptions,
the
club
date
music
industry
is
the
only
industry
where
you
have
unions
and
no
collective
bargaining
agreements.
this
is
apparently
due
to
the
very
diverse
nature
of
the
club
date
music
employers.
these
employers
generally
hire
bands
for
non-commercial
purposes
sporadically,
often
once
in
a
lifetime.
a
typical
club
date
employer
is
the
father
of
the
bride
who
hires
a
band
for
his
daughter's
wedding.
it's
obviously
impossible
for
the
afm
to
negotiate
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
a
group
as
diverse
as
fathers
of
the
bride.
because
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
carroll,
the
union
in
order
to
insure
that
its
musician
members
got
scale
wages
unilaterally
mandated
scale
wages.
now,
in
carroll,
in
order
to
provide
that
agents
would
then
not
book
jobs
for
union
members
at
less
than
scale,
they
had
to
regulate
the
agents.
in
carroll
the
club
date
employers,
the
fathers
of
the
bride,
did
not
pay
the
union
member
musicians
directly.
this
is
unlike
the
situation
of
equity
where
equity
producers
directly
play
equity
actors.
in
carroll
the
club
date
employers
paid
the
orchestra
leaders
who
often
function
also
as
booking
agents.
accordingly,
if
the
agents
were
not
regulated
by
the
union,
there
was
no
assurance
that
the
agents
would
pay
scale
or
any
other
wages
over
to
the
union
members.
the
carroll
court
predicated
its
regulation
of
agents
upon
two
very
specific
findings
of
fact,
and
i
quote
them:
"the
booking
agent
regulations
were
adopted
because
of
experience
that
(1)
many
booking
agents
charged
exorbitant
fees
to
members,
and
(2)
booked
engagements
for
musicians
at
wages
which
were
below
union
scale.
"
this
is
from
page
113.
here,
as
i
previously
noted,
it
is
impossible
for
a
theatrical
agent
to
book
a
job
for
an
equity
member
at
less
than
scale
because
of
equity's
collective
bargaining
agreement.
thus,
equity
has
not
even
attempted
to
prove
that
since
the
advent
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
any
theatrical
agent
ever
booked
a
job
for
any
equity
member
at
less
than
scale.
mr.
howard
breindel
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
breindel
i
don't
believe--
mr.
howard
breindel
--well,
he
may
be...
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
he's
netting
less
than
scale,
but
what
happens
is,
an
equity
producer
pays
an
actor.
the
actor
cashes
his
check.
he
has
disposable
income.
he
can
pay
his
landlord,
he
can
pay
his
doctor,
he
can
pay
his
grocer,
and
he
may
even
pay
his
agent,
but
it's
coming
out
of
disposable
income.
now--
mr.
howard
breindel
--not
under
new
york
state
law
which
governs
each
and
every
petitioner
in
this
action.
the
crux
of
carroll,
i
think,
is
illustrated
by
the
afm's
licensing
agreement
in
carroll.
the
afm's
licensing
agreement
in
carroll
restricted
booking
agents
from
booking
jobs
for
union
members
at
less
than
scale
wage.
if
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
carroll,
as
we
have
in
equity,
that
provision
in
that
licensing
regulation
would
be
totally
useless,
and
unnecessary.
with
respect
to
the
carroll
finding
of
fact
that
agents
charged
exorbitant
commissions,
i
first
note
that
in
carroll
the
afm
permitted
the
booking
agents
to
charge
a
commission
of
15
percent.
now,
there's
no
evidence
that
any
theatrical
agent
ever
charged
an
actor
a
commission
of
15
percent,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
a
theatrical
agent
ever
charged
an
actor
a
commission
in
excess
of
ten
percent.
unlike
the
situation
in
carroll,
our
agents
are
all
regulated
and
licensed
as
employment
agencies
by
new
york
state
law,
and
as
such
they
cannot
charge
more
than
ten
percent.
i
must
stress
that
in
carroll--
mr.
howard
breindel
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
a
specific
law
which
licenses
employment
agencies
which
has
very
specific
provisions
dealing
with
the
actual
employment
agencies.
mr.
howard
breindel
yes,
it
is.
mr.
howard
breindel
it
is,
precisely.
in
carroll,
again,
i
must
stress
that
the
agency
regulations
were
predicated
solely
upon
the
effect
that
agents
had
upon
the
union
member
scale
wages.
contrary
to
the
union's
arguments
here,
the
carroll
court
did
not
in
any
way
rely
on
such
arguments
as
agents
control
access
to
employment,
or
that
it's
necessary
to
regulate
agents'
commissions
to
eliminate
wage
competition
between
union
members.
the
unions
offer
three
reasons
to
justify
their
pervasive
and
exhaustive
regulation
of
agents.
they
say
agents
control
access
to
employment,
they
say
that
the
prohibition
of
commissions
on
scale
jobs
is
necessary
to
prevent
invasion
of
union-negotiated
minimums,
and
they
say
that
the
regulation
of
agents'
commissions
is
necessary
somehow
to
eliminate
wage
competition
among
union
members.
taken
separately
or
collectively,
these
reasons
do
not
justify
equity's
exhaustive
regulation
of
agents.
assuming
that
it
is
the
agents
rather
than
the
producers
who
control
access
to
employment
and
recognizing
that
agents
admittedly
have
greater
access
to
most
employers
than
do
most
actors,
that
circumstance
just
does
not
justify
the
existence
of
equity's
pervasive
franchising
system
because
it's
not
intimately
related
to
wages,
hours,
or
working
conditions,
which
are
the
subject
of
numerous
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
unions
have
not
cited
any
case
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
union
is
justified
in
imposing
restraints
of
trade
upon
independent
business
persons
simply
because
those
business
persons
have
greater
access
to
potential
employers
than
union
members.
virtually
every
employment
agency
exists
in
business
because
that
employment
agency
has
greater
access
to
an
employer
than
the
applicant
does.
this
is
true
for
employment
agencies
who
place
dishwashers,
who
place
corporate
executives,
who
place
lawyers.
why
should
a
union
member
be
treated
any
differently
than
any
applicant
who
gets
a
job
from
an
employment
agency
which
is
licensed
and
regulated?
finally,
in
this
connection,
i
would
note,
it's
the
unions
who
control
access
to
the
employment
of
agents.
the
regulation
of
agents'
commissions
is
not
necessary
to
prevent
wage
competition
among
union
members.
now,
there
was
no
such
argument
made
by
the
unions
below
and
there
was
no
such
finding
by
the
district
court.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
here
held
that
the
union,
equity,
could
not
eliminate
wage
competition
without
regulating
agents'
commissions.
there
was
absolutely
no
finding
of
fact
in
the
record
to
justify
that
conclusion.
there
was
no
evidence
offered
that
if
you
struck
the
franchising
system
it
would
result
in
actors
competing
with
each
other
for
agents'
service.
and
there
was
no
such
evidence
offered
because
equity
never
made
that
argument.
mr.
howard
breindel
if
there
was
proof
like
that,
it
might
support
the
court
of
appeals's
conclusion
that
it's
necessary
to
regulate
agents'
commissions.
mr.
howard
breindel
yes.
mr.
howard
breindel
well,
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
competition
the
union
has
been
talking
about.
mr.
howard
breindel
i
would
say,
no,
your
honor,
because
the
elimination
of
wage
competition--
mr.
howard
breindel
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
it
doesn't
follow,
because
the
elimination
of
wage
competition,
which
is
a
traditional
union
labor
objective,
is
the
kind
of
elimination
of
competition
between
union
members
involved
in
dealing
with
employers,
not
union
members
competing
for
the
services
of
people
such
as
actors
who
perform
services
in
turn
for
the
union
members.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
what
would
happen
if
the
franchising
system
was
struck.
i
submit
that
what
would
happen
would
be,
actors
would
continue
to
pay
agents
their
traditional
ten
percent
commission
permitted
by
new
york
state
law.
if,
despite
the
lack
of
evidence,
the
actors
then
wanted
to
compete
for
an
agent's
services,
they
would
have
to
compete
by
offering
the
agent
a
commission
in
excess
of
ten
percent,
which
is
simply
not
allowable
under
new
york
state
law.
mr.
howard
breindel
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
breindel
i
don't
know
if
it's
inevitable,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
the
agents--
mr.
howard
breindel
--well,
the
agents
are
now
obtaining
scale
jobs
for
union
members
without
any
commission
whatsoever,
so
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
might,
if
the
prohibition
was
struck,
they
might
obtain
scale
jobs
for
actors
at
the
commission
less
than
ten
percent.
if
they
can
do
it
for
nothing,
it
stands
to
reason
that
they
can
do
it
for
something
less
than
ten
percent.
mr.
howard
breindel
i
think
that's
a
fair
presumption.
mr.
howard
breindel
well,
i
think
there
would
be
more
monies
flowing
into
agents'
pockets,
but
it
will
soon--
mr.
howard
breindel
--it
will
simply
be
money
that
agents
have
earned.
mr.
howard
breindel
well,
let's
turn
to
a
very
practical--
mr.
howard
breindel
--yes.
yes.
but
let's
turn
to
a
very
practical
example,
the
new
york
chapter
of
screen
actors
guild,
sag.
that
particular
organization
permits
its
members
to
pay
commissions
on
scale
jobs
to
agents.
now
sag
has
submitted
a
brief
to
this
court.
nowhere
in
this
brief
does
sag
contend
that
its
new
york
actors
who
pay
commissions
on
scale
jobs
have
as
a
result
not
received
the
minimum
wage
set
forth
in
sag's
collective
bargaining
agreements.
nowhere
does
sag
contend
that
its
members
who
pay
commissions
on
scale
jobs
have
engaged
in
wage
competition.
nowhere
does
sag
contend
that
its
new
york
members--
mr.
howard
breindel
--they
might,
but
there's
no
evidence
of
that
on
this
record.
mr.
howard
breindel
that's
not
only
suggested,
it
states
it,
but
without
any
record
cite.
mr.
howard
breindel
that's
a
possibility--
mr.
howard
breindel
--that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
breindel
exactly.
mr.
howard
breindel
the
merits
technically
are
whether
or
not
the
union's
franchising
agreement
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
was
not
decided
by
either
court,
although
it
was
fully
argued.
mr.
howard
breindel
correct.
let
me,
if
i
might,
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
franchise
fees.
there
is
a
deafening
silence
from
the
unions
with
respect
to
their
lack
of
efforts
to
justify
the
imposition
of
franchise
fees
upon
agents.
the
only
thing
said
is
an
incorrect
statement
by
equity
that
there
was
a
factual
finding
in
the
court
below
that
equity's
franchise
fees
were
cost
justified.
now,
there's
nothing
in
equity's
by-laws,
in
its
constitution,
or
in
its
agreement
with
tara,
which
requires
equity
to
limit
its
franchise
fees
to
the
cost
it
incurs
in
administering
the
franchise
system.
now,
apart
from
this,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not,
are
equity's
franchise
fees
cost
justified?
the
issue
is,
should
carroll
be
extended
to
permit
equity
to
extract
franchise
fees
from
agents
regardless
of
the
amount?
the
justifications
given
by
the
union
for
regulating
agents
and
agents'
commissions
do
not
give
any
support
whatsoever
to
the
extraction
of
franchise
fees
from
agents.
if
the
union
did
not
collect
another
dime
in
franchise
fees
from
agents,
this
would
not
interfere
with
union
wage
scales,
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
union
goal
of
eliminating
wage
competition,
it
would
not
interfere
with
the
union's
collective
bargaining
agreement--
mr.
howard
breindel
--exactly.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
over
that.
that's
one
of
the
prices
agents
must
pay.
mr.
howard
breindel
the
argument
for--
mr.
howard
breindel
--well,
i
would
say
the
union
has
a
legal
monopoly
over
the
labor
market
of
its
union
members.
but
the
cases
are
clear
that
when
you
abuse
and
misuse
a
legal
monopoly
such
as
here,
by
extracting
franchise
fees
from
independent
businesspersons,
you've
abused
and
misused
your
monopoly
power.
i
think
that's
clear
under
such
cases
as
united
states
v.
griffith
and
the
ottertail
case.
it's
an
improper
extension
of
a
legal
monopoly.
mr.
howard
breindel
well,
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
i
think
the
franchise
agreement
between
equity
and
tara,
which
mandates
that
all
franchised
agents
pay
franchise
fees
is
that
type
of
conspiracy
or
agreement
which
we
are
alleging.
mr.
howard
breindel
yes.
mr.
howard
breindel
absolutely.
and
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
by
judge
motley
who
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
tara,
the
franchised
agents
who
are
parties
to
the
franchise
agreement
with
equity
specifically
requested
equity
to
enforce
that
rule.
but
in
connection
with--
mr.
howard
breindel
--yes.
there's
no
dispute
over
that
fact.
if
you
find
that
agents
are
part
of
the
non-labor
group,
then
the
franchise
agreement
which
is
between
equity
and
tara,
a
group
of
agents--
mr.
howard
breindel
--not
really.
the
union
shop
structure
pertains
to
a
very
legitimate
traditional
union
labor
objective.
that
is,
getting
and
keeping
more
jobs
for
union
members.
the
franchise
agreement
which,
for
example,
fixes
the
prices
and
commissions
that
agents
may
charge,
simply
goes
totally
beyond
that.
the
imposition
of
franchise
fees
similarly
does.
mr.
howard
breindel
for
equity
the
franchise
fee,
the
initial
franchise
fee,
is
$200.
and
then
the
annual
franchise
fee
for
an
agent
is
$60
and
for
a
subagent
$40.
mr.
howard
breindel
it's
not
very
much,
but
for
these
petitioners'
agents,
who
don't
make
very
much,
it
seems
to
be
a
lot
to
them.
moreover,
there
are
other
unions
such
as
sag
which
charge
thousands
of
dollars
in
franchise
fees.
mr.
howard
breindel
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
howard
breindel
screen
actors
guild.
mr.
howard
breindel
sag.
now,
what
will
happen
here--
mr.
howard
breindel
--it's
basically
the
same.
that's
why
sag
has
submitted
an
amicus
curiae
brief,
because
their
arrangement
is
basically
the
same
as
equity.
mr.
howard
breindel
the
new
york
chapter,
not
the
los
angeles
chapter,
or
the
chicago
chapter.
mr.
howard
breindel
right.
correct.
but
not
any
of
the
other
chapters
of
sag.
what's
going
to
happen
here
if
the
franchising
system
is
illegal?
the
primary
purpose
for
which
equity
exists,
to
negotiate
collective
bargaining
agreements,
will
remain
unchanged.
equity
is
free
to
bargain
collectively,
and
its
collective
bargaining
agreements
will
not
be
affected
in
any
way.
the
business
of
finding
employment
for
actors,
i
submit,
will
continue
unchanged
except
that
agents
will
now
be
free
to
compete
with
each
other
and
will
be
free
of
union
domination.
in
this
connection
let
me
point
out
that
there
are
personal
managers
who
represent
equity
actors.
these
personal
managers
charge
a
commission.
that
commission
is
not
regulated
by
equity,
nor
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
personal
managers
represent
equity
actors
regulated
by
actor's
equity.
moreover,
the
personal
managers,
unlike
our
theatrical
agents,
are
not
regulated
by
any
state
law.
nevertheless,
equity
continues
to
exist--
mr.
howard
breindel
--that's
a
disputed
issue.
they're
not
supposed
to.
they
perform
other
services,
such
as
getting
them
coaching
lessons,
teaching
them
how
to
dress,
holding
their
hands.
mr.
howard
breindel
theoretically,
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
breindel
they're
a
teacher,
a
confidant,
in
place--
mr.
howard
breindel
--it's
like
a
stage
mother.
mr.
howard
breindel
right.
mr.
howard
breindel
if
the
franchising
system
is
struck
down,
the
agents
will
now
be
able
to
bargain
with
equity
as
employers
do
on
equal
terms.
this
will
replace
the
present
bargaining
situation
where
equity
tells
the
agents
to
take
it
or
leave
it.
thus,
howard
hausman,
who's
the
chief
negotiator
for
tara
with
equity,
mr.
hausman
is
himself
an
agent
and
a
william
morris
agent.
he
testified
as
to
the
last
negotiations
between
equity
and
tara,
and
this
is
what
he
said
and
i
quote:
"we
all
considered
that
equity's
point
of
view
was
indefensible,
outrageous,
horrible,
wrong,
simply
because
they
were
expecting
agents
to
subsidize
the
lowest
paid
actors,
somehow,
to
work
for
them
without
getting
paid.
"
"we
still
feel
that
way.
"
"we
accepted
a
deal
under
which
that
was
imposed
on
us.
"
if
the
court
strikes
down
the
franchising
system,
it
will
simply
mean
that
equity
is
no
longer
free
to
impose
a
group
boycott
upon
agents.
it's
no
longer
free
to
fix
the
prices
of
agents.
it's
no
longer
free
to
force
agents
to
work
for
nothing,
and
to
do
so
with
immunity
by
hiding
behind
a
statutory
exemption
which
was
designed
for
totally
different
purposes.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
breindel
yes.
mr.
howard
breindel
very
briefly,
in
connection
with
mr.
lurie's
statement
that
there
was
no--
mr.
howard
breindel
--in
connection
with
mr.
lurie's
statement
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
was
aware
of
that
agents
are
leaving
the
field
or
are
reluctant
to
enter
it,
let
me
quote
from
page
196
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
a
letter
from
the
president
of
tara
to
equity.
tara's
president
said
this:
"many
of
our
members"...
that
is,
the
agents...
"doubt
whether
they
can
long
continue
in
the
field.
"
"without
naming
names,
we
all
know
that
many
fine
and
trusted
agents
have
deserted
the
ranks,
either
going
into
other
fields
such
as
personal
management
or
moving
to
the
west
coast.
"
"many
of
those
who
function
now
in
the
field
of
equity
get
their
living
from
other
sources
such
as
commercials,
other
motion
picture
deals,
and
so
forth.
"
"other
agents
have
had
to
give
up
their
independence
and
merge
with
bigger
offices,
but
even
the
big
and
powerful
agencies
find
it
now
unprofitable
to
handle
work
in
the
theater,
especially
the
representation
of
the
average
income-earning
equity
member.
"
thank
you.
mr.
howard
breindel
no,
i
don't.
