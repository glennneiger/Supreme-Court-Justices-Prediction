justice
white
i
gather
then
that
if
an
agent
all
year
long
never
got
a
job
for
any
of
his
clients
above
scale
he
wouldn't
make
anything?
justice
white
and
that
isn't
very
likely,
though,
is
it?
justice
white
so,
why
will
agents
do
that
for
nothing?
justice
white
and
then
he'll
be
paid
a
good
deal
above
scale
and
he
could
make
up
to
ten
percent?
justice
white
do
producers
ever
pay
agents?
justice
white
by
whom?
justice
white
under
state
law
or
by...
or
both?
justice
white
that's
because
it
necessarily
would
follow
that
if
they
weren't
paying
the
agent
maybe
they
would
have
paid
the
actor?
justice
white
but
if
you're
right,
it
would
mean
that
the
agent
would
be
free
and
the
actor
would
be
free
to
let
the
agent
collect,
say,
ten
percent
of
a
scale
wage
as
a
commission?
justice
white
and
that
means
that
the
actor
is
getting
less
than
scale?
justice
white
he's
netting
less
than
scale?
justice
white
and
he
can't
pay
him
more
than
ten
percent,
anyway?
justice
white
well,
what
if
there
were
proof
like
that?
justice
white
you
mean
its
conclusion
that
this
is
within
the
exemption?
justice
white
you
mean,
if
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
competition
among
actors
in
the
sense
that
one,
some
actors
would
offer
agents
five
percent,
and
others
eight
percent,
and
others
nine
percent,
and
others
ten
percent?
is
that
the
kind
of
competition
you're
talking
about?
justice
white
well,
suppose
there
was
proof
that
that
would
happen,
absent
this
system?
would
that
put
this
system
within
the
exemption?
justice
white
well,
then,
you
should
argue
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
their
conclusion
doesn't
follow?
justice
white
--but
they
do,
they
might
engage
in
competition
for
agents'
services
by
offering
higher
commissions.
justice
white
does
the
amicus
brief
suggest
that
actors
offer
different
amounts
to
agents
or
not?
justice
white
well,
of
course,
you
are
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
presumably,
unless
you
can
point
to
some
federal
law
that
the
defendants
have
violated,
you
ought
not
to
prevail,
and
even
if
you
win
here
on
the
labor
exemption
argument,
the
case
still
would
have
to
go
back
to
find
out
whether
the
practices
were
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
white
but
the
courts
below
just
didn't
let
you
get
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
white
and,
i
take
it
that
unless
someone...
if
somebody
says
i'll
live
up
to
all
your
rules
for
the
franchise
fee,
he
is
then
out
of
business?
i
mean,
he
cannot
represent
equity's
members?
justice
white
and
in
which
event
your
argument
for
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
would
be
what?
justice
white
say
you
win.
how
would
you
argue
that
as
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
white
so
you
think
you
have
to
go
at
it
on
the
monopoly
side
rather
than
on
any
conspiracy
or
agreement
side?
justice
white
and
it
is
part
of
the
agreement
between...
is
it
a
part
of
the
franchise
agreement
between
equity
and
the
franchised
agents--
justice
white
--that
they
won't
deal
with
others?
justice
white
so
this
is
an
agreement
between,
you
say,
between
independent
businessmen
and
the
union
not
to
deal
with
other
businessmen?
justice
white
well,
that's
not
very
much
these
days.
justice
white
but
they
don't...
that's
a
different
arrangement,
isn't
it?
justice
white
they
permit,
they
allow
commissions
for
scale
wages?
justice
white
the
new
york
chapter
allows
commissions
on
scale
jobs?
justice
white
well,
would
you
say,
for
the
purposes
of
the
exemption,
which
is
what
we're
arguing,
that
this
case
is
comparable
to
what
it
would
be
if
the
producers
and
the
union
had
had
an
agreement
which
provided
that
the
producers
would
secure
actors
only
through
a
union,
you
might
call
it
a
hiring
hall?
justice
white
well,
suppose
they
did?
justice
white
i
know,
but
suppose
they
did,
would
it
be
any
more
suspect
than
this
one,
or
any
less?
justice
white
would
it
be
any
more
exempt
or
any
less
exempt
under
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
white
yes.
wouldn't
it
be
essentially
the
same?
justice
white
but
no
more
and
no
less
than?
justice
white
isn't
there...
the
agents
who
are
franchised
don't
insist
that
the
union
not
deal
with
other
agents?
justice
white
yes,
so
there
is
an
agreement,
whether
you
call
it
a
conspiracy
or
not,
that
they
won't
deal
with
other
agents
who
won't
pay
the
franchise
fee.
justice
white
would
you
think
it
would
be
different
for
purposes
of
the
exemption
if
it
were
otherwise,
that
the
union
simply
made
an
agreement
with
a
group
of
agents
not
to
deal
with
anybody
else,
even
if
they
were
willing
to
live
up
to
all
the
rules?
justice
white
but
is
it
any
different?
justice
white
but
that
isn't
this
case,
is
it?
well,
that
can't
be
true,
because
if
that
were
true
you'd
allow
commissions
on
scale,
for
people
that
have
been
on
a
scale.
justice
white
even
sarah
bernhardt
had
problems?
justice
white
what
about
the
fee?
justice
white
should
be
paid
for
by
the--
justice
white
--by
the
agents?
justice
white
that
certainly
wasn't
covered
by
carroll.
justice
white
--mr.
gold,
i'm
just
curious.
here
we
are
dealing
in
the
labor,
at
least
we're
dealing
with
jobs.
suppose
the
union
and
its
members
simply
announced
that
none
of
the
members
of
this
union
will
deal
with
any
attorneys
who
charge
more
than
x
dollars
an
hour.
we'll
deal
with
anybody
who
will,
but
we
just
won't
deal
with
anybody
who
won't...
who
charge
any
more.
or
doctors,
that
they
have
to...
we'll
deal
with
them
if
they
have
a
satisfactory
scale.
that
may
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws
but
would
it
be
within
the
labor
agreement?
justice
white
and
in
my
example,
that's
not
the
labor
market.
justice
white
it
may
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws
but
it
does--
justice
white
well,
do
you
say
the
same,
mr.
gold,
if
access
was
limited
here,
if
only
a
selected
group
of
agents
were
franchised?
justice
white
i
agree
with
you
but
now
suppose
the
agents
have...
what's
their
organization?
justice
white
tara.
they
have
an
agreement
with
equity
and
only
tara
members
can
deal.
