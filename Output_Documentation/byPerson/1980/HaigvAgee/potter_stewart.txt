so
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
stewart
and
with
reference,
i
think,
to
all
members
of
the
armed
services
who
leave
the
country
under
orders,
because
they're
ordered
to.
justice
stewart
a
soldier
doesn't
need
a
passport.
justice
stewart
to
be
sent
to
west
germany.
justice
stewart
but
even
after
1856,
for
many
years,
almost
a
century
or
more,
a
passport
was
not
a
travel
control
document
as
such,
was
it?
justice
stewart
well,
on
the
other
hand,
you
can
kind
of
turn
that
argument
around
and
say
that
so
long
as
a
passport
was
no
more
than
a
letter
of
introduction,
so
to
speak,
that
maybe
it
was
in
the
discretion
of
the
president
not
to
give
such
a
letter
to
anybody
whose
morals
he
didn't
like,
but
it
wouldn't
affect
that
person
very
much.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
and
in
this
case
the
effect
of
the
revocation
of
the
passport
was
to
bring
the
man
home
and
make
him
stay
there?
to
his
home,
back
in
our
country?
justice
stewart
and
that
wouldn't
have
been
the
effect
of
the
revocation
of
a
passport
in
the
19th
century?
justice
stewart
in
the
19th
century?
justice
stewart
and
it
most
recently
amended
the
statute
in
1978,
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
also
limited
the
secretary's
power--
justice
stewart
--on
area
restrictions.
justice
stewart
i
know,
but
that's
why--
--it
involved
membership
in
the
communist
party,
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
there
is
no
first
amendment
in
that
there's
no
written
constitution
in
england.
justice
stewart
well,
how
can
actions
taken
in
england
violate
the
law
of
the
united
states?
suppose
he
killed
somebody
at
the
press
conference,
could
he
be
prosecuted
over
here?
justice
stewart
that's
a
violation
of
the
law
of
great
britain.
