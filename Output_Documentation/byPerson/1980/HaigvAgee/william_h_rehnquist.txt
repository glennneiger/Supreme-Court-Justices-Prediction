justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
when
was
the
respondent
issued
his
passport?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
the
issuance
of
the
press
release?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
which
perhaps
i
ought
to
know
the
answer
to
but
don't.
what
is
the
purpose
of
a
passport?
it's
been
my
own
experience
in
the
couple
of
times
i've
been
abroad
other
than
in
the
army
that
you
don't
need
a
passport
to
get
out
of
this
country.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
if
the
president
should
appoint
mr.
x
as
his
ambassador
plenipotentiary
to
the
middle
east
and
direct
the
secretary
of
state
who
is
his
employee
to
issue
a
passport
to
him,
that
congress
could
prohibit
the
issuance
of
that
passport?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
congress
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
take
this
hypothetical,
that
the
congress
decides
that
there
are
just
too
many
people
leaving
the
country
and
traveling
around
and
as
a
result
we're
having
to
provide
too
much
protection
in
the
way
of
military
force
abroad,
because
they're
getting
into
trouble.
so
we
don't
want
anybody
leaving
the
country
and
therefore
we
forbid
the
issuance
of
passports.
do
you
think--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
also
held
in
curtiss-wright
that
the
president
is
the
sole
organ
of
execution
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
supposing
a
person
right
now
were
to
apply
for
a
passport
to
go
to
salvador,
and
when
asked
the
purpose
of
his
journey,
to
say,
to
denounce
the
united
states
policy
in
salvador
in
supporting
the
junta,
however
one
pronounces
it
in
spanish.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
secretary
of
state
says,
i
just
will
not
issue
a
passport
for
that
purpose.
do
you
think
that
he
can
consistently
do
that
in
the
light
of
our
previous
cases?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
renewed.
do
you
also
have
the
data
on
when
it
was
issued?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
wulf,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
that
congress
can
limit
the
president's
authority
to
revoke
or
grant
a
passport
to
someone
whom
he
has
previously
issued
it
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
if
the
president
appoints
an
ambassador
to
italy
and
trouble
comes
up
in
italy
and
the
president
summons
the
ambassador
home,
that
the
ambassador
can
simply
stay
in
italy
and
keep
his
passport,
saying
i've
got
a
right
to
travel
and
i'm
not
going
to
come
home?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
wouldn't
be
ambassador
for
long,
i'm
sure,
but--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
reject--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
reject
the
court
of
appeals'
distinction,
then?
that
although
there
may
be
authority
not
to
issue,
there
is
no
authority
to
revoke?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
all
of
your
answer
exclude
"in
time
of
declared
war"?
