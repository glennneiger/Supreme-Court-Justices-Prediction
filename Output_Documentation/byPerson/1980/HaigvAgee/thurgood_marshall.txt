well,
could
he
be
charged
with
a
crime
if
he
were
in
the
united
states
and
said
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
doesn't
have
a
gun,
i
don't
know
what
crime
he
committed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
willing
to
go
that
far
afield.
i'm
willing
to
say,
if
he
talks
over
here
the
exact
same
words
he's
charged
with
talking
over
there,
you
couldn't
do
anything
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
are
not
punishable
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
have
to
say
that
taking
his
passport
is
not
punishment.
don't
you
have
to
say
that?
justice
marshall
