justice
john
paul
stevens
what,
as
a
practical
matter,
happened
when
it
was
revoked?
did
he
turn
it
in
and
did
he
come
back
to
the
united
states?
does
the
record
tell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
question
whether
he
can
use
that
card
for
extended
travel
a
question
of
whatever
law
he,
the
country
he
seeks
to
travel
to
or
from?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
far
as
american
law
is
concerned,
the
only
thing
that...
it
doesn't
prejudice
his
ability
to
come
back
to
the
united
states,
and
apparently
he
doesn't
want
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
did
he
couldn't
get
out
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wulf,
can
i
ask
what
your
position
is
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
revoke
a
passport
for
matters
such
as
writing
bad
checks,
being
convicted
of
crimes,
or
something
of
that
kind,
non-political
in
context,
but
is
there
authority
for
the
secretary
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
does
not
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
agree
that
that's
a
proper
basis
for
revocation
of
a
passport,
and
if
so,
what's
the
authority
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
kent
create
an
authority
that
did
not
previously
exist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
did
it
find
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
history,
rather
than
in
any
written
regulation
or
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
sort
of
like
to
figure
out
where
the
thing
started.
i
mean,
where
did
the
original
power
revoke
for
that
reason
come
from?
there
must
have
been
a
first
case,
when
there
would
have
been
no
prior
history
to
justify
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wulf,
let's
put
these
facts
to
one
side
for
a
moment
and
put
to
one
side
cases
in
which
there
are
preexisting
contracts
restraints
or
violations
of
law;
just
the
conduct
of
an
american
citizen
while
abroad.
does
the
united
states
have
any
control
over
what
a
citizen
may
do
other
than
by
trying
to
restrict
his
right
to
travel
by
revoking
his
passport?
if
it
has
any.
maybe
it
has
none,
which
is
essentially
your
position--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
it
has,
other
than
extraterritorial
crime,
which
is
a
rather...
there
are
instances,
of
course,
but
other
than
that,
if
it
is
to
impose
any
meaningful
control
over
what
our
citizens
abroad
may
do
that
may
impact
on
national
security
or
anything
else,
it
must
be
through
this
device,
must
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
precisely,
the
issue
is
whether
the
regulation
issued
pursuant
to
the
statute
that
congress
did
enact
was
within
the
power
of
the
president
as
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
state
under
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
regulation
purports
to
have
been
issued
pursuant
to
the
statute
which
says,
it
gives
the
power
initially
to
the
president,
and
he's
redelegated
it
to
the
secretary
of
state.
