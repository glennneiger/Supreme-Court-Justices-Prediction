justice
white
and
not
controverted?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
a
specific
statute
which
permits
revocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
has
there
been
a
regulation
which
permits
the
secretary
to
revoke?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
now
one,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
revocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
covering
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has...
when
was
the
travel
act
passed,
8
u.s.c.
1185?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
there
been,
was
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
have
there
been...
has
that
been
reenacted
since
1926?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
prior
to
that,
or
at
least
since
that,
there
have
been,
you
say,
express
regulations
permitting
revocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
the
22
u.s.c.
211(a)
which
authorizes
the
secretary
to
grant
passports?
has
that
been
reenacted
recently?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
it
been
amended
since?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hasn't
the
process,
though,
for
issuing
passports
been
revised
in
the
last
20
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
don't
you...
didn't
you
used
to
be
able
to
get
it
at
some
district
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
something
a
little
different
than
justice
rehnquist's.
but
even
if
you
couldn't
retrieve
a
passport
for
the
reason
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
that
doesn't
cover
this
case
where
the
threat
is
to
the
lives
of
other
american
citizens.
justice
white
well,
your
affidavit
in
the
record
says
it
was
issued
march
30,
'73,
and
expires
on
march
29,
1983.
justice
white
and
it's
been
renewed
now
until
'83?
justice
white
well,
i'm
just
reading
from
your
affidavit,
that's
all.
justice
white
that's
what
you
say.
justice
white
but
you
say
it
was
issued
on
march
30,
'73?
and
do
not
suggest
that
it
was
renewed,
but
it
was?
you
said--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
same
statement
says,
there
were
numerous
other
refusals
for
security
reasons,
in
addition
to
the
ones
that
might
be
harmful
to
relations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
kent
involve
a
revocation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
so
you
do
say
that
despite
the
absence
of
any
express
power
to
revoke
in
the
secretary,
the
secretary
at
least
for
some
reason
may
revoke
a
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
can
refuse
for
a
reason
he
can
revoke
for
the
same
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wulf,
suppose
then
that
mr.
agee
or
somebody
else
applies
for
a
passport
and
he
says,
i
know
i'm
subject
to
a
secrecy
agreement
but
i
want
to
go
england
and
reveal
the
names
of
people
that
i
am
forbidden
to
reveal
here,
and
if
i
go
to
england
i
can
do
it
and
probably
get
away
with
it.
but
i
fully
intend
to
breach
my
contract
by
going
abroad.
and
the
secretary
says,
well,
awfully
sorry,
you're
subject
to
the
agreement
and
you're
not
going
to
get
a
passport.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
he's
in
england.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
were,
if
congress
did
pass
the
law
you
referred
to
and
made
it
a
crime
to
do
that,
and
a
person
applied
for
a
passport
and
the
secretary
says,
what
are
you...
somehow
the
secretary
knew
and
he
freely
conceded
that
he
was
going
to
go
abroad
and
break
that
law,
could
he
refuse
a
passport?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wulf,
you
would
like
to
put
mr.
agee
in
the
same
category
as
any
other
citizen,
and
treat
him
like
any
other
citizen.
i
would
think
you
might
win
with
any
other
citizen
and
still
lose
about
mr.
agee.
the
logic
would
be
because
he
is
subject
to
an
agreement
which
you
agree
binds
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
don't
but
he
isn't,
in
that
regard
he's
not
like
just
any
other
citizen.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
other
citizens
aren't
subject
to
the
agreement,
though.
at
least
you
have
to
concede
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'd
take--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
suppose
you'd
take
the
same
position
if
the
secrecy
agreement
said,
nor
will
i
travel
abroad
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
implicit
authorization
to
do
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
to
revoke
for
these
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
agree
that
there
is
a
power
to
revoke?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
right
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
a
historical
practice
of
revoking--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
not
for
the
reasons
claimed?
