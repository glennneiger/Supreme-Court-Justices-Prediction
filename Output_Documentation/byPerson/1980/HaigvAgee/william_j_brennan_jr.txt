justice
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
as
to
the
subject
of
revocation,
insofar
as
there
are
any
constitutional
implications,
it's
irrelevant
that
congress
has
not
expressly
given
the
secretary
of
state
power
to
revoke?
justice
jr.
well,
you're
not
suggesting
either,
are
you,
that
the
power
to
revoke
depends
upon
some
statutory
authority?
justice
jr.
and
so
far,
at
least,
knowing
that
there
were
such
regulations,
it
never
did
anything
to--
justice
jr.
--in
any
way
modify
or
repeal
them
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
the
statutory
authority
is
requisite;
if
it
is
at
all,
it's
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
you
call
those
activities?
political
activities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
in
that
connection,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
notice
in
footnote
7
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
a
footnote
at
14a
which
recites,
based
on
statistics
supplied
by
the
secretary,
that
in
1955
21
passport
applications
were
refused,
and
in
1956
ten
such
applications
refused
because
the
applicants
were
"participants
in
political
affairs"
is
there
any
record
as
to
what
the
particular
participation
was
in
those
instances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
kent
v.
dulles
rather--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--sort
of
required
at
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--well,
does
this
case
involve
something
more,
like
kent
v.
dulles,
or
are
the
areas
of
restriction
similar?
justice
jr.
well,
kent
v.
dulles
involved,
did
it
not,
preaching
communist
doctrine?
justice
jr.
there's
a
preaching
aspect
of
it,
and
there,
i
was
thinking
about
my
brother
rehnquist's
hypothetical
to
you.
justice
jr.
and
their
preaching
communist
doctrine
he
said
you
couldn't
refuse
a
passport
to
go
and
do
that.
justice
jr.
and
the
difference
from
going
to
salvador?
justice
jr.
how
is
the
salvador
one
involved
in
this?
justice
jr.
well,
might
i
ask,
mr.
wulf,
the
same
question
i
asked
of
the
solicitor
general
about
that
information
in
footnote
7
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
is
that
the
fact,
do
you
know?
it's
at
page
14a
of
the
petition
for
cert.
it
states
that
21
passport
applications
in
'55
and
ten
passport
applications
in
'56
were
refused
because
the
applicants
were
"participants
in
political
affairs
abroad
whose
activities
were
deemed
harmful
to
good
relations.
"
do
you
know
what
those
cases
are?
justice
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
be
significant
in
terms
of
the
issue
you're
now
arguing
if
that
were
so?
justice
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
wulf,
that
we're
not
told
how
many
of
those
36-odd
were
bad
check,
unpaid
debt,
difficulty
with
the
police,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
was
to
see
if
we
could
find
out.
justice
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
now,
mr.
wulf,
as
in
kent,
that
mr.
agee's
activities
have
first
amendment
protection?
justice
jr.
--i
know,
but
what
was
the
constitutional
protection
for
whatever
the
activities
were
that
were
involved
in
kent,
wasn't
it
in
every
instance
the
first
amendment?
justice
jr.
mr.
wulf,
i
don't
think
you've
answered
mr.
justice
stewart
or
justice
white.
justice
jr.
well,
suppose
it's
not
a
crime
by
the
law
of
the
foreign
state?
i
think
that's
justice
stewart's
question.
justice
jr.
even
though
the
conduct's
committed
abroad,
where
it's
not
a
crime?
justice
jr.
get
an
injunction
before
he
gets
on
the
plane.
justice
jr.
well,
anyway,
mr.
wulf,
you
would
argue
that
if
there
were
explicit
statutory
authorization
to
revoke
for
this
kind
of
conduct,
the
statute
to
that
extent
was
unconstitutional
because
this
kind
of
conduct
has
first
amendment
protection?
