i
think
you

proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
its
origins,
mr.
solicitor
general,
was
it
not
in
effect
a
letter
of
introduction
from
the
president
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
are
there
not
extant
passports
given
190
and
180
years
ago
that
were
personally
signed
by
the
president?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
wulf.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--which
of
our
prior
cases,
mr.
wulf,
would
you
think
presented
conduct
and
acts
comparable
to
that
of
the
respondent
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
disclosure
of
national
security
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.

did
any
of
the
people
involved
in
any
of
that
litigation
get
themselves
involved
in
releasing
classified
information
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
might
be
suspicion,
founded
or
not
founded,
but
how
does
that
compare
with
the
statements
released
by
mr.
agee
in
the
london
press
conference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
worse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
think
that
the
in
personam
restraint
of
an
american
court
injunction
would
follow
him
in
london
or
beirut
or
wherever?
an
in
personam--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
times
in
the
past
have
there
been
conduct
that
is
directly
comparable
to
this
by
an
american
passport
holder?
you
were
talking
about
a
history,
so,
if
the
events
never
occurred,
there
wouldn't
be
any
history.
are
there
others?

you,
gentlemen,

case
is
submitted.
