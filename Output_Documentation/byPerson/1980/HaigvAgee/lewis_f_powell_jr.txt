justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wulf,
is
it
your
position
that
the
first
amendment
protects
everything
that
mr.
agee
is
said
to
have
stated
in
his
press
release
in
london
in
1974,
including
the
exposing
of
cia
agents
abroad?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
even
if
exposing
the
agents,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
argued,
resulted
in
their
death,
is
that
a
proper
exercise
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is
proof
of
an
agent
dying
as
a
result
of
mr.
agee's
disclosures;
i
just
don't
know.
but
i
would
think
the
occupation
is
sufficiently
hazardous
without
having
one's
name
publicly
revealed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
that
sort
of
legislation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
it
adopted--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--even
if
the
statute
is
otherwise
valid?
not
void
for
vagueness?
the
first
amendment
protects
a
right
to
disclose
publicly
secret
agents
of
the
united
states
wherever
they
may
be?
that's
your
position?
