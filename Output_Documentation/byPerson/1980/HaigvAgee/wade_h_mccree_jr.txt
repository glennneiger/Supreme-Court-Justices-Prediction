mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
president
of
the
united
states
acting
through
the
secretary
of
state
has
the
authority
to
revoke
the
passport
of
an
american
citizen
whose
international
travel
activities
concededly
have
caused
and
will
continue
to
cause
serious
damage
to
the
national
security
and
to
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
found
in
28
u.s.c.
2254(1),
and
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
this
controversy
may
be
succinctly
stated.
for
11
years,
from
1957
until
1968,
respondent,
an
american
citizen,
was
employed
by
the
central
intelligence
agency
in
the
course
of
which
employment
he
took
an
oath
which
this
court
considered
in
snepp
recently,
not
to
divulge,
except
upon
prior
approval,
any
information
gained
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
during
the
course
of
his
employment
he
became
acquainted
with
the
techniques
of
intelligence
gathering
of
the
central
intelligence
agency,
and
learned
the
identities
of
many
covert
operatives
who
were
employed
by
or
utilized
by
that
agency.
many
of
these
persons
are
still
employed
abroad
by
the
agency.
in
1974
respondent
publicly
announced
his
intention
to
disrupt
and
to
destroy
the
central
intelligence
agency.
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
footnote
2
on
page
3
of
our
brief
in
which,
in
an
extraordinary
press
release
in
london
on
october
3,
1974,
he
said...
and
i'll
just
mention
the
first
paragraph:
"today
i
announced
a
new
campaign
to
fight
the
united
states
cia
wherever
it
is
operating.
"
"this
campaign
will
have
two
main
functions:
first,
to
expose
cia
officers
and
agents
and
to
take
the
measures
necessary
to
drive
them
out
of
the
countries
where
they
are
operating;
secondly,
to
seek
within
the
united
states
to
have
the
cia
abolished.
"
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it's
in
an
affidavit
that
was
filed
with
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
not
controverted.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
his
passport...
i
can't
answer
that
precisely
without
reference
to
the
record,
but
his
passport
was
issued,
i
believe,
before
he
terminated
his
employment,
which
would
be
1968,
because...
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
before
the
issuance
of
the
press
release.
but
i
can't
tell
you
specifically,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
can
furnish
that
if
it
becomes
relevant.
the
respondent
has
traveled
abroad
extensively
from
his
current
residence
in
the
federal
republic
of
germany,
and
is
purported
to
identify
cia
agents,
employees,
and
sources
in
several
countries.
these
activities
have
resulted
in
a
number
of
understandable
consequences,
including
his
exclusion
from
four
west
european
countries
because
of
these
activities.
on
one
occasion
his
coauthor
of
a
book
in
kingston,
jamaica,
identified
15
reported
cia
agents
whose
homes...
the
homes
of
two
of
which
were
violently
attacked
by
armed
men
subsequent
to
the
disclosure.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
a
passport
is
currently
required
both
to
enter
and
to
leave
the
united
states
under
an
act
of
congress
in
1978,
unless
the
president
provides
otherwise
by
rule.
and
he
has
provided
otherwise
by
rule
with
reference
to
any
country,
i
believe,
in
this
hemisphere
except
cuba,
and
certain
western
european
countries
do
not
require
it
either.
but
there
is
such
a
statute--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--and
that
would
of
course--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--of
course
he
does
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
that's,
of
course,
not
inconsistent,
either,
with
the
presidential
rule
which
exempts
non-military
personnel
from
leaving
the
country.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
not,
and
i'm
confident
he
could
not,
and
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
general
rule
which
would
exclude
a
person.
certainly,
the
authorization
vested
in
the
president
in
the
travel
control
act
of
1978
would
more
than
cover
that,
because
the
president
can
exempt
from
the
operation
of
this
statute,
which
forbids
departure
and
reentry
without
a
passport,
according
to
rules
and
regulations
that
he
might
promulgate.
there
are...
to
reply
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
first
question,
the
passport
as
i
understand
it
serves
two
purposes.
first,
the
purpose
of
identifying
the
bearer
as
a
citizen
or
a
national
of
the
issuing
nation;
and
second,
to
request
free
passage
for
him
from
a
foreign
nation
as
well
as
the
efforts
of
the
foreign
nation
to
facilitate
his
travel.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
was
essentially
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
very
well
may
have
been
because
before
1856
the
congress
did
not
enter
this
area
of
passport
control
at
all.
before
1856,
the
first
passport
act,
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
secretary
of
state,
and
indeed
other
persons,
including
governors,
mayors,
and
in
some
instances
notaries
public
executed,
issued
passports,
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
of
1856,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
was
to
restrict
the
issuance
just
to
the
secretary
of
state,
acting
under
the
president
of
the
united
states,
under
such
rules
and
regulations
as
he
might
promulgate.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
and
except
in
time
of
war,
there
were
few
instances
when
it
occurred.
as
we
show
historically
in
our
brief,
in
the
war
of
1812,
for
example,
for
the
first
time
that
we
could
trace,
a
passport
was
required
for
travel
control,
and
this
applied
to
persons
who
had
crossed
the
enemy
lines.
i
think
this
was
in
1815.
the
second
time
i
believe
it
happened
was
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war,
when
again
a
travel
control
statute
was
enacted.
the
third
time
was
1918,
just
after
the
first
world
war,
when
again
a
travel
control
statute
was
issued.
and
part
of
our
argument,
of
course,
is
that
when
these
travel
control
statutes...
and
i
could
take
the
others
from
1918.
there
was
1941,
and
1952,
and
then
1978.
when
each
of
these
travel
control
statutes
was
passed,
they
assumed
that
the
president
would
be
issuing
and
refusing
to
issue
passports,
because
a
travel
control
act
would
make
sense
to
require
a
passport
if
it
didn't
emanate
from
someplace,
nor
would
it
make
sense
if
there
was
not
the
power
to
revoke
or,
indeed,
to
decline
its
issuance.
and
we
contend
that
this
is
evidence
that
the
congress
intended
the
secretary
of
state
to
have
the
authority
which
we
insist
he
possessed
here
to
revoke
respondent's
passport.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
there
have
been
instances
when
the
president
has
endeavored
to
do
that,
just
because
he
didn't
approve
of
someone's
political
beliefs,
for
example.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
that's
the
kent
case,
where
this
court
without
reaching
the
constitutional
contention
that
was
made
there,
held
that
a
passport
could
not
be
denied
a
person
because
of
his
political
affiliation.
and
later
when
the
congress
attempted
to
do
that,
in
aptheker
and
dayton
this
court
determined
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
do
it.
we're
not
contending
for
thought
control,
or
the
control
of
associations
here.
we're
contending
that
when
a
citizen's
activities,
not
his
thoughts,
abroad
are
causing
or
are
likely
to
cause
serious
damage
to
the
national
security
and
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states,
that
the
president
has
the
power
not
to
issue
the
passport
or,
if
having
issued
it,
to
revoke
it.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case
when
in
december,
1979,
just
a
month
after
the
seizure
of
the
hostages
in
teheran,
and
after
this
extraordinary
statement
at
a
press
conference
by
the
respondent,
the
secretary
of
state
notified
respondent
that
his
passport
had
been
revoked
and
told
him
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
the
appropriate
regulation,
and
offered
to
hold
an
expedited
hearing
in
west
germany
where
respondent
lives.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
would
be
the
purpose
of
it.
or
certainly
to
deprive
him--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--without
a
travel
control;
that's
correct.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
without
a
travel
control
statute,
concomitant
travel
control
statute,
which
we
say
must
be
considered
in
pari
materia
with
this
passport
control.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i'm
advised
that
he
went
to
the
consulate
where
he
tendered
it
for
validation,
and
it
was
taken
up
by
the
employee
at
the
consulate,
and
he
was
given
instead
an
identification
card
which
would
permit
him
to
return
home,
but
he
cannot
use
for
extended
travels,
and
so
physically
his
passport
has
been
cancelled.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
may
be,
because
another
country
can
of
course,
a
sovereign
country
can
have
its
own--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that's...
well,
he
may
want
to
do
that
but
in
any
event
he
could
not--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--he
would
not
get
out
again.
also,
it
does
not
identify
him
as
a
person
who
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
united
states
in
that
country.
and
it's...
anyone
who's...
as
of
course
the
members
of
the
court
have
done,
who
have
traveled
internationally,
recognize
that
it's
better
to
be
with
a
passport
than
without
a
passport.
that's
the
issue...
but
that's
the
only
sanction
which
has
been
imposed
upon
him
for
these
activities
here.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
no
specific...
there
is
not.
no,
sir.
there
is
not.
in
1926,
july
3,
the
last
of
the
series
of
statutes
authorizing
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
the
secretary
of
state
to
issue
passports,
in
accordance
with
rules
and
regulations,
does
not
contain
either
the
power
to
refuse
or
to
revoke--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--we...
in
our--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--yes,
the
current
one,
i
believe,
was
enacted
in
1968,
but
there
have
been
regulations
and
rules
of
the
department
of
state
going
back
before
the
statute
of
1856.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
with
respect
to
denial
and
revocation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
some
of
them.
we
have
instances
in
our
brief.
for
example,
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
where
we
discuss
the
passport
act
of
1856.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
current
one
was
july
3,
1926.
but
it's--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it's
the
successor
of
the
act
of
1856.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
has
not.
the
current
act
is
the
1926
act,
the
passport
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
since
that
there
have
been
several
regulations
and
rules
promulgated.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
before
that.
we
set
some
of
them
out
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
and
26;
again
on
page
29
and
30
of
our
brief;
again
on
pages
35
and
36
of
our
brief.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
not
since
1926.
but
as
we
show--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it
has
not.
but
as
we
show...
it
has
not
been
amended
with
reference
to
the
claimed
authorization
here.
it
has
been
amended,
i
believe,
insofar
as
it
pertains
to
area,
to
permissible
areas,
where
the
holder
of
a
passport
can
go.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh,
from
time
to
time
there
have
been--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--oh,
yes,
it's
been
changed
several
times,
and
our
point,
and
our
argument
is,
that
with
the
changes,
as
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
where
the
delegated
power
to
be
issued
from
courts
to
passport
offices
and
so
forth,
the
congress
being
aware
of
this
practice
by
the
secretary
of
state
has
never
seen
fit
to
withdraw
the
power
to
deny
the
issuance
on
the
one
hand,
or
to
deny
the
power
to
revoke
a
passport
once
issued
on
the
other,
for
the
reason
involved
here,
and
that
is
the
national
security
of
the
country,
which--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that
would
raise
a
constitutional
question,
at
a
minimum,
because
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
international
travel
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
although
entitled
to
lesser
protection
than
intrastate
travel.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
that,
of
course,
is
the
separation
of
powers
argument,
which
would
also
be
involved
were
there
to
be
such
a
situation
as
the
court
has
propounded.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
would
contend
that.
but
we
are
not
claiming
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation
the
inherent
power
to
revoke,
because
we--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--not
at
all,
but
we're
willing
to
address
this
question
as
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
it,
which
was
to
see
whether
the
congress
impliedly
granted
the
authority
to
revoke
when
it
granted
the
authority
to
grant.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
never
took
any
steps.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
never
did
with
reference
to
either
of
these
matters.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
1978
it
amended
the
travel
control
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
limited
the
area--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--and
it
did
not
do
this,
being
fully
aware
of
these
matters.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
this
is
certainly
our
contention.
the
court
below
followed
that
analysis
to
see
whether
there
was
congressional
grant
of
authorization
by
implication,
because
concededly
it
is
not
expressly
there,
and
it
found
that
there
was
not
because
there
was
not
what
it
regarded
as
a
consistent
and
unequivocal
practice,
which
we
believe
is
just
blinking
at
the
history
which
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
which
the
dissenting
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
set
forth
with
great
feeling
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
the
court
below
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
questions
that
respondent
raised,
and
we
don't
think
these
constitutional
questions
are
substantial.
respondent
here
is
not
being
punished
for
speech
or
association,
but
for
activity,
for,
as
he
put
it
best
in
his
own
press
release,
"for
seeking
to
disrupt
and
destroy.
"
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
they
are
political
activities
and
more.
they
are
certainly
activities
creating
serious
danger
to
the
national
security.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
in
some
instances
there
are,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
others,
there
are
not.
there
was
a
period
when
what
is
perhaps
this
century's
"communist"
and
last
century's
syndicalist
or
anarchist,
where
passports
were
denied
for
reasons
of--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--but
kent...
that's
right.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
kent
v.
dulles,
and
aptheker,
and
dayton,
threw
all
of
that
out.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no,
this
case
involves
identifying
a
covert
employee,
an
undercover
employee
of
our
intelligence
service,
and
leaving
him
to
the
tender
mercies
of
whatever
might
happen
to
a
person
so
identified
in
a
country
where
we
haven't
the
power
to
protect
him.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
correct.
he
did
nothing
other
than
words,
but
these
words
were
as
deadly
as
bullets.
in
kingston,
jamaica,
after
the
coauthor,
his
coauthor
of
a
book,
identified
15
agents,
the
homes
of
two
of
them
were
attacked
violently
by
armed
men,
and
if
words
will
precipitate
that
and
they're
uttered
with
the
knowledge
that
they
will--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--he
might.
i
suppose
a
holdup
man
who
says,
stick
'em
up,
and
maybe
doesn't
brandish
a
gun
at
all--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know,
if
he
puts
a
person
in
fear
of
his
life
and
extracts
his
wallet
from
him...
well--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--you
might
not.
but
we
are
not
claiming
that
he
committed
a
crime
that's
indictable,
that's
an
indictable
offense.
but
we're
claiming
that
these
are
activities
that
go
beyond
pure
speech.
this
is
not--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it
may
not
be
punishable,
we're
not
contending
that
it's
punishable
here,
but
we're
saying
that
it
creates
a
serious--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it's
a
form
of
punishment,
but
it's
not
criminal
punishment.
it's
an
implementation
of
the
national
security.
if
this
nation
cannot
have
operatives
abroad
who
can
keep
it
advised
of
intelligence
matters
that
may
affect
our
security,
certainly
the
safety
of
every
one
of
us
is
diminished.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
say,
yes,
he
can.
because
we
have
to
vest
these...
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
secretary
of
state
working
under
him
are
charged
with
conducting
the
foreign
policy
of
the
nation,
and
the
freedom
of
speech
that
we
enjoy
domestically
may
be
different
from
that
that
we
can
exercise
in
this
context.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
that's
quite
different,
perhaps--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--well,
it
was
both,
as
i
understand
it.
it
was
membership
and
policy--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--oh,
i
think--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--because
there
was
no
showing,
there
was
no
contention--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--there
was
no
contention
made
that
that
damaged
the
national
security.
now,
if
our
national
security--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--well,
it
just
might,
because
it
might
be
a
provocation
that
would
involve
us
militarily.
for
example...
and
i'm
out
of
the
record
in
answering
this...
but
just
recently
two
americans
have
been
killed
in
salvador.
apparently
they
were
some
kinds
of
undercover
persons
working
under
the
cover
of
a
labor
organization,
and
if
this
person
identified
them
as
not
being
what
they
appeared
to
be
but
as
undercover
operatives
and
it
resulted
in
their
deaths,
it
seems
to
me
a
rule
that
would
deprive
the
president
of
the
united
states
from--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
there
is
any.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
have
60
seconds
left
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
two
matters.
first,
in
response
to
counsel's
claim
about
the
effect
and
the
intent
of
the
1978
amendments,
i
would
refer
you
to
page
47
of
our
brief,
where
we
set
forth
the
senate
report
which
makes
it
clear,
and
i
read:
"the
committee
recognizes
clearly
that
the
passport
authority
should
not
be
restricted
in
any
way
which
would
limit
the
president's
ability
to
control
the
departure
of
united
states
citizens
to
foreign
countries
when
such
travel
is
inconsistent
with
a
greater
government
interest.
"
the
other
matter
to
which
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention,
if
i
may,
is
on
this
seven-page
reply
memorandum
that
we
filed
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
where
we
set
forth
the
colloquy
conducted
by
the
court
and
counsel
in
the
district
court,
where
counsel
under
very
careful
questioning
concedes
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
determination
of
the
validity
of
this
regulation,
he
concedes
that
his
client
was
causing
or
likely
to
cause
serious
damage
to
the
national
security.
and
i
suggest,
therefore,
that
he
admits
that
he
is
fully
within
the
ambit
of
this
regulation
which
means
that
this
court
needn't
decide
the
question
whether
his
conduct
was
within
the
regulation.
of
course,
it
leaves
the
constitutional
question
as
well
as
the
statutory
authorization
question
to
be
determined.
and
with
that,
we
would
submit
our
case
on
the
briefs.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you.
