mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
sorry
justice
rehnquist
had
to
leave
because
i
did
just
want
to
start
by
specifically
answering
one
factual
question.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
just
want
to
answer
one
question
which
you
asked
the
solicitor
general
that
has
to
do
with
when
mr.
agee's
passport
was
last
renewed.
it
was
last
renewed
in
1978,
which
was
after
that
press
release,
and
after
his
principal
book
was
published
in
1975.
this
case
involves
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
assume
it
was
issued
five
years
previously
thereto;
i
think
five
years
is
now
the
standard
period.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
an
error.
it
was
issued
in
'73.
it
expired
in
'78--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--and
is
renewed--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--it
must
be
a
typographical
error.
i
know
that
his
passport
expired,
the
one
that
was
revoked,
expired,
was
to
expire
in
1983.
it
was
issued--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--yes.
oh;
i'm
sorry.
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
was
renewed
in
'78;
yes.
because
they're
only
good
for
five
years.
this
case
does
involve
the
constitutional
right
to
travel.
according
to
doctrine
by
this
court
in
kent
and
zemel,
the
power
to
issue
passports
is
a
power
that
ultimately
is
within
the
authority
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
and
congress
must
authorize
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
any
curtailment
on
the
right
to
travel.
the
government,
of
course,
concedes
that
there's
no
explicit
authorization
in
this
case,
and
the
task
of
this
court
is
to
see
whether
it
can
divine
from
the
history
presented
to
it
by
the
government
and
by
ourselves
as
well
whether
there
is
any
implicit
authorization
which
has
to
be
based
as
the
court
held
in
kent
and
zemel
on
a
substantial
and
consistent
administrative
practice.
i
would
like
to
just
summarize
our
argument
in
a
nutshell
and
then
treat
each
of
the
separate
arguments
individually.
our
first
argument
is
that
kent
itself
disposes
of
this
case,
because
kent,
taken
together
with
its
companion
case
dayton,
in
fact
was
a
case
which
dealt
with
matters
of
national
security
and
foreign
policy
considerations.
it
was
not
merely
a
case
confined
to
speech
and
association,
as
the
government
would
have
the
court
see
it.
two,
should
the
court
disagree
with
our
analysis
about
the
extent
of
kent,
then
we
can
show
historically
that
there
is
a
total
absence
of
any
substantial
and
consistent
practice,
which
is
required
to
find
that
congress
implicitly
authorized
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case.
both
of
those
arguments
are
supported
by
the
fact
that
after
kent
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1958,
the
then
administration
tried
very,
very
hard,
and
very,
very
unsuccessfully
to
secure
legislation
which
would
authorize
the
very
kind
of
authority
which
it
has
exercised
in
this
case
against
mr.
agee.
and
finally,
looking
around
for
what
the
intention
of
congress
actually
is,
we
come
to
the
amendments
in
1978,
substantial
amendments
in
1978,
of
section
211(a),
which
is
the
fundamental
passport
authority,
and
section
1185,
which
is
the
lineal
descendent
of
all
of
the
wartime
national
emergency
provisions.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
according
to
the
decision
in
kent,
he
has
plenary...
congress
has
plenary
authority.
the
authority
resides
in
congress,
it
does
not
reside
in
the
executive
branch.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
he
can
certainly
be
deposed
and--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--not
at
all.
yes.
i
think
he
can
refuse
to
come
home.
in
that
case
he
would
presumably
have
a
diplomatic
passport;
he
might
have
to
turn
that
one
in.
he'd
be
entitled
to
reissuance
of
a
standard
passport
if
he
was
no
longer
ambassador.
in
1978,
explicitly,
congress
expressed
what
its
intentions
were,
and
its
intentions
there
were
to
withdraw
whatever
authority
the
court
had
allowed
it
to
exercise
in
the
area
of
geographical
restrictions,
in
the
zemel
case;
and
secondly,
it
revoked
section
1185
of
the
title
viii,
which
was
the
travel
control
statute,
and
reversed
the
purpose
of
that
statute
180
degrees
and
required,
although
it
still
requires
that
passports
be
used
for
entry
and
exit
by
citizens
of
the
united
states,
the
purpose
is
not
to
allow
the
executive
branch
to
exercise
travel
control
over
citizens
who
hold
passports,
but
to
facilitate...
and
that
is
explicitly
what
is
in
all
of
the
congressional
history
relating
to
1185...
to
facilitate
travel
of
american
citizens
because
of
the
now
general
requirement
abroad
that
travelers
present
passports
upon
entry
to
foreign
countries.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
kent
involved
the
same
kind
of
considerations
that
are
involved
here.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--well,
the
kent
decision,
particularly
the
kent
dissent;
and
of
course
we
all
remember
the
history
of
that
period
when
travel
by
american
communists
and
communist
sympathizers
was
prohibited,
during
the
'50s.
all
of
the
expressions,
all
of
the
explanations
about
why
that
was
being
done
had
to
do
with
considerations
which
were
identical
to
the
kind
of
national
security
and
foreign
policy
concerns
expressed
by
the
government
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
party
in
dayton
v.
united
states,
which
was
a
companion
case
to
kent,
the
basis
on
which
his
passport
was
refused
at
that
time,
which
led
to
the
decision
here,
was
that
it
was
thought
that
he
had
something
to
do...
and
i
quote
from
the
charges
against
him...
something
to
do
with
the
rosenberg
espionage
ring,
and
that
he
was
at
a
meeting
somewhere
in
new
york
where
information
was
prepared
for
delivery
to
a
foreign
nation.
there
was
no
charge--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--oh,
i
would
think
they
would
be
worse,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
statements
that
mr.
agee
released
are
expressions,
political
expressions
which
are
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
there's
no
first
amendment
protection
to
engage
in
espionage
or
sabotage.
i
think
the
dayton
case
is
worse
than
the
agee
case.
i
don't
think
the
agee
case
is
bad,
but
i
think
that
in
the
government's
terms
dayton
is
worse.
our
brief
essentially
here
today
is
that
given
the
government's
best
case,
in
its
brief,
in
terms
of
the
historical
information
which
it
has
provided
the
court,
that
this
court
cannot
confidently
conclude
that
the
congress
has
implicitly
authorized
the
power
which
the
government
seeks
to
exercise
here,
that
the
government's
best
case
leaves
it
very
doubtful,
leaves
it
very
ambiguous,
leaves
it
very
uncertain,
about
whether
the
kind
of
implicit
authorization
which
is
required
has
been
found,
will
be
found
in
this
case.
and
that
this
court
ought
not
guess
about
whether
there
is
any
such
implicit--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--no,
i
don't
know
what
they
are,
and
neither
does
the
government,
your
honor,
because
there's
absolutely
no
explanation
about
those
in
the
documents
where
they
appear.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
they
are
insignificant,
your
honor,
because
there's
no
explanation
about
what
they
mean.
and
they're
as
insignificant
as
are
the
other
statistics
which
the
government
has
provided
to
the
court,
because
of
the
admixture
of
the
kinds
of...
i'm
looking
for
the...
because
of
the
different
kinds
of
categories
under
which
those
various
passports
were
revoked,
or
refused.
and
it's
in
our
brief,
what
is
lumped
together,
there
were
in
1955
refusal
of
passports
in
six
cases.
at
the
same
time
there
were
persons
whose
previous
conduct
abroad
has
been
such
as
to
bring
discredit
on
the
united
states
and
cause
difficulty
for
other
americans,
gave
bad
checks,
left
unpaid
debts,
had
difficulties
with
police,
et
cetera.
there's
another
category
in
'56
which
refers
to--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--we
can't
find
out,
because
they--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--well,
their
saying
it
isn't
proof
that
it
exists,
your
honor,
and
they
can't
produce
the
proof
because...
well,
they
haven't
produced
it;
perhaps
they
can
but
they
haven't
here,
and
they
have
to
rely
on
the
record
which
they
presented
to
the
court
here.
the
fact
is
that
i
think
that
those
statistics
are
completely
useless
because
of
the
totally
inadequate
description
of
what
they
were
all
about.
i
mean,
if
there
are
56
such
cases,
55
of
them
could
have
been
for
bad
checks
and
one
of
them
might
have
been
for
something
related
to
foreign
policy
and
national
security.
but
i
think
that
this
court
can't
make
a
decision
based
upon
that
kind
of
data
which
is
just
totally
insufficient.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i'm
sorry?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
we
won't
disqualify
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
he
doesn't
have
authority.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
right.
if
that
was
done
abroad,
if
it's
not
a
crime
within
the
united
states...
it
might
be,
under
some
statute;
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
conclusively...
but
if
it's
according
to
kent,
there
are
only
two
grounds
upon
which
the
executive
branch
can
refuse
to
issue
passports.
one,
whether
or
not
the
applicant
is
a
citizen;
and
two,
whether
the
applicant
is
trying
to
escape
the
foils
of
the
law,
as
the
opinion
put
it.
it's
pretty
clear
that
what
they
mean
is
whether
the
applicant
has
committed
a
crime
within
the
united
states.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
authority
for
that
is
that
kent
found
that
that
was--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--kent
found
the
authority
when
it
hadn't
been
previously
looked
for.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
history.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
absolutely;
absolutely.
because
the
only
statute
is
211(a)
which
broadly
confers
the
power
to
issue
passports--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--there
were
first
cases
in
the
19th
century
which
are
described
in
one
or
another
of
the
briefs
before
the
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
kent
was
a
refusal.
frankly,
i
lump
them
together,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
wouldn't
deny
that.
we
haven't
argued
that
there's...
we
haven't
argued
a
distinction
between
a
refusal
to
issue
and
a
revocation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
wouldn't
contest
that;
no.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
i
go
beyond
that,
of
course,
because
i
think
kent
is
broader
than
merely
a
first
amendment
case.
we
believe
that
kent
and
dayton,
taken
together,
involve
the
same
kind
of
national
security-foreign
relations
concerns
which
are--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
argue
the
distinction
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
sir.
it
is
our
position
that
that
is--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--oh,
it's
protected
with
respect
to
american
law.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
there
is
no
claim
at
all
here
that
his
revelations
have
resulted
in
anybody's
death.
in
fact,
there's
a
specific
disclaimer
in
one
of
the
affidavits
that's
in
the
record
that
nothing
that
he
has
said
has
resulted
in
the
death
or
injury
of
any
member
of
the
cia.
and
that's
at
116a
of
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--well,
as
you
presumably
know,
your
honor,
there
has
been
attempts
continually
being
made
for
the
last
year
or
two
in
congress
to
adopt
a
statute
which
would
make
it
a
crime
to
identify
cia
and
other
covert
action--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--and
the
congress
has
been
unsuccessful
in
doing
it,
and
no
bill
has
been
acted
on,
no
statute
has
been
adopted.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
until
then,
if
such
a
statute
should
be
adopted,
i
dare
say
that
the
question
of
constitutionality
will
be
here
soon
enough.
in
the
meantime,
i
believe
that
that
kind
of
identification
is
indeed
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
general
that
is
my
position.
in
particular,
i
would
say
that
mr.
agee,
like
mr.
snepp,
would
be
subject
to
the
same
terms
of
the
secrecy
agreement,
to
the
same
terms
of
the
secrecy
agreement
that
he
executed.
and
in
fact,
he
us
now
subject
to
that
agreement.
there
is
an
injunction
outstanding
against
him,
which
he
is
complying
with.
so
whatever...
as
of
the
past
few
months.
so
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
before
then,
he
is
now
bound
by
that
injunction.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
would
think
that
that's
not
the
remedy.
the
remedy
is
not
to
deprive
him
of
a
passport.
the
remedy
is
to
proceed
on
a
contempt
citation
against
him
under
the
injunction.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
when
he
comes
back,
if
he
comes
back.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
answer
is
that
if
he
has
so
conducted
himself
that
he
is
not...
has
committed
a
crime
which
is
only
a
crime
by
the
law
of
a
foreign
state,
he
can't
be,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
it's
a
crime
by
the
law
of
the
united
states,
he
can
be
prosecuted
here,
of
course.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
might
in
some
circumstances.
i
think
there
are
some
extraterritorial
problems--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--i
said
i
do
not
believe
so,
and
i
believe
his
remedy
is
in
the
criminal
law,
or
if
there's
an
injunction,
for
contempt.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
perhaps
they
can
get
an
injunction
to
enforce
the
injunction
against
him
prohibiting
him
from
revealing
information.
but
apart
from
that,
i
believe
that
there
is
no
authority
to
withhold
his
passport.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
might
well,
it
might
well.
i
could
see
that
kind
of
an
injunction
which
is
breached
abroad
being
basis
for
a
contempt
citation
here.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
wouldn't
shock
me
very
much.
i
must
say,
though,
that
this
concentration
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
i
beg
your
leave,
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
really
with
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
why
the
government
has
concentrated
on
the
facts
in
this
case
in
trying
to
make--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--i
think
it
has
none
unless
there
is
an
extraterritorial
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
it
must
be.
but
the
issue
today
is
whether
congress
declares
that
it
will
be.
i
mean,
that's
the
issue
today.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
disagree.
the
issue
is,
whether
there
was
any
authority
for
the
regulation
at
all.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
has
any
bearing
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
for
purposes
of
travel
i
believe
he
is
like
any
other
citizen,
and
i
don't
see
how--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--i
concede
that,
but
i
also
would
argue
that
that
agreement
is
subject
to
independent
enforcement,
which
has
no
bearing
on
the
question,
the
basic
question
here
about
congressional
authorization.
i
mean,
obviously,
i
would
like
you
all
to
forget
about
the
facts
of
the
agee
case,
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
and--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--in
terms
of
what
the
issue
is
before
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
might
take
a
different
position,
but
it
doesn't
say
that,
of
course,
so
i
don't
have
to
take
any
position.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
we
don't
deny
that
in
times
of
declared
war
there
can
be
restrictions,
limitations
imposed
on
travel
which
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
and
of
course
congress
has
adopted
such
legislation
in
1918,
1941,
and
related
legislation
in
1952.
but
none
of
that
is
in
effect
now,
of
course,
including
the
1952
legislation,
since
that
national
emergency
is
no
longer
in
effect.
there
is
no
national
emergency.
our
second
argument,
of
course,
goes
to
the
question
whether
there
is
any
proof
presented,
historical
proof
presented
to
you
by
the
government
which
would
persuade
you
that
there
is
the
necessary
consistent
history
of
administrative
practice
which
is
necessary
to
find
authorization.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
government
described
seven
in
its
brief,
extending
from
1906
to
1970,
and
then,
of
course,
it
also
lumps
together
those
other--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--well,
there
were
62
in
their
opening
brief.
it
turns
out
to
be
100
in
their
reply
brief,
of
those
nondescript
cases
out
of
the
statistics.
specifically
they
refer
to
seven
cases
in
the
last
75
years
which
they
claim
as
the
basis
for
their
support
of
an
administrative
practice.
they're
in
the
brief
and
it
was
only
one
of
them,
in
1970,
which
was
in
fact
under
the
same
regulation.
the
others
weren't
under
any
regulation
at
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
was...
they
were
just
under
the
claimed
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
state.
as
i
said
in
opening,
i
think
that
these
examples
of
administrative
practice
presented
to
the
court
by
the
government
are
far
too
ambiguous,
far
too
uncertain
a
basis
upon
which
this
court
ought
to
rest
its
judgment
that
they
will
find
implicit
authorization.
i
think
that
that--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--implicit
authorization
for
the
regulation
applied
here
against
mr.
agee.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
to
refuse
passports--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
--yes.
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
quite;
quite
right.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
precisely;
yes.
and
with
that...
and
the
court
ought
not
make
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
here.
that
decision
ought
to
be,
the
court
ought
to
require,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
constitutional
right,
that
congress
exclusively
say
what
its
intentions
are
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
power
which
is
asserted
in
the
regulation
before
the
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
would
make
that
argument,
but
then
we
would
deal
squarely
with
the
constitutionality
in
first
amendment
terms
of
the
authority
which
was
concededly
granted
to
the
executive
branch.
but
today
we
don't
believe
that
that
authority
exists.
i
think
that
the
1978
amendments
really
settle
this
case.
there
congress
revoked
what
authority
this
court
had
given
to
the
government
in
the
zemel
case
regarding
geographical
restrictions,
which
certainly
shows
an
intent
to
withdraw
whatever
authority
the
executive
branch
had
with
respect
to
national
security
and
foreign
policy
considerations.
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
