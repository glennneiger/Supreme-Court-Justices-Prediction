unknown
speaker
is
there
a
good
map,
mr.
pierce?
there's
a
rather
poor
map
on
a59.
unknown
speaker
a
little
bit
better.
unknown
speaker
now,
on
that
one,
are
the
colors
significant?
the
yellow--
--west
drive
is
in
blue,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
one
on
the
north?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
side,
that's
on
the
other
side
of
the
highway?
of
what
street?
unknown
speaker
jackson.
unknown
speaker
and
the
barrier
about
which
which
we're
speaking
is
at
the
intersection
of
west
drive
and
jackson?
unknown
speaker
on
the
west
side
of
it?
or
the
left
hand
side
on
this
map?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
pierce.
on
this
map,
could
you
roughly
give
me
the
boundaries
of
hein
park?
unknown
speaker
and
where
are
you
looking
now,
mr.
pierce?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
pretty
good
one
on
144
of
the
appendix--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
it
is.
144
seems
to
me
to
be
very
legible.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
small
point,
but
that
north
parkway,
i
gather,
is
quite
a
different
street
than
the
north
drive
shown
on
number
144?
unknown
speaker
that's
within
hein
park?
unknown
speaker
and
then,
overton
park,
which
has
been
the
subject
of
previous
litigation
in
this
court--
unknown
speaker
--is
a
large
park,
south.
unknown
speaker
the
largest
one
in
town,
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
racial
composition
of
the
planning
commission?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pierce,
does
the
record
contain
a
transcript
of
the
proceedings
before
the
city
council?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
vote,
mr.
pierce?
unknown
speaker
and
the
three
black
members
voted
against?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pierce,
does
the
record
tell
us
why
this
happened
at
the
particular
time
in
history
it
did?
in
other
words,
were
there
changes
in
traffic
patterns
or
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
residential
neighborhood,
either
in
hein
park
or
out,
or
why
did
this
happen
when
it
did?
unknown
speaker
largely
white?
unknown
speaker
was
that
traffic
white
or
black?
unknown
speaker
was
that
traffic
getting
more
and
more
black?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
contradict
that?
unknown
speaker
then,
it's
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
before
you
can
get
to
that
there's
the
preliminary
question
about
whether
or
not
section
1982
even
in
the
presence
of
racial
intent
can
apply
in
circumstances
such
as
these
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
ever
make
that
claim
in
the
courts
below?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
not
as
much;
any?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
that
discrete
issue,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
certainly
pleaded
in
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pierce,
what
do
you
mean
by
requirement
of
intent?
supposing
one
of
the
residents
of
hein
park
was
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
and
openly
and
notoriously
disliked
persons
of
the
black
race
and
said
so
repeatedly
and
said,
that's
the
reason
he
wanted
to
close
off
the
drive.
would
that
have
made
it
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
intent?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
all
the
property
owners
part
of
the
decisional
process?
don't
they
all
have
to
consent?
well,
they
are
to
an
extent,
but
only
in
the
fact
that
they
are
a
competing
interest,
the
same
that
the
opponents
are
part
of
the
policymaking.
the
decisionmakers,
the
true
decisionmakers
which
in
this
instance
was
the
council,
they've
got
to
weigh
these
interests,
they've
got
to
determine,
make
political
decisions.
mr.
pierce,
is
it
your
position
that
the
only
way
this
case
can
be
upheld
would
be
for
the
council
to
have
adopted
a
resolution
that
we
are
doing
this
for
the
sole
purpose
of
denying
these
people
their
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
short
of
that?
unknown
speaker
what's
short
of
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
do
a
little
psychoanalyzing
of
the
minds
of
the
council.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
arlington
heights
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause
case,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
this...
at
least,
one
aspect
of
this
case
is
it's
a
statutory
case
under
1982.
unknown
speaker
although
there
is
also
reliance
on
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pierce,
before
you
sit
down--
unknown
speaker
--the
district
judge
in
his
opinion
that
appears
on
page
a-34
set
forth
the
five
factors
that
the
court
had
identified
in
arlington
heights
that
should
be
considered
in
a
case
of
this
kind
arising
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
said,
as
i
understood
it,
that
he
considered
those
five
factors
in
weighing
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
one?
unknown
speaker
trezevant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
are
you
through
with
your
map
for
the
moment?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
asked,
there's
quite
a
difference
between
that
map
and
the
map
your
adversary
showed
us
and
i
don't
know
who's
right.
but
he
shows,
the
map
that's
at
the
back
of
the
hein
park
brief,
does
not
show
the
entrance
to
the
zoo
where
yours
does.
it
shows
the
entrance
to
the
zoo
at
the
end
of
university
avenue.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
this,
what's
in
the
record
here
is
wrong,
and
the
entrance
is
right
at
the
end
of
west
drive.
because
i
had
the
impression,
very
candidly,
that
looking
at
their
map,
that
one
who
went
to
the
zoo
would
go
down
university
avenue.
but
looking
at
your
map,
i
would
assume
they'd
go
right
straight
down
west
park.
and
the
judge
didn't
say
anything
about
the
entrance
to
the
zoo.
unknown
speaker
the
same.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
think
the
map
submitted
by
the
hein
park
group
is
quite
deceptive,
if
that's
a
correct
presentation.
but
anyway,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
hard
to
see
that.
we
can't
get
it
any
higher?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
on
the
map
point,
is
everything
south
of
north
parkway
a
part
of
overton
park,
in
this
area,
including
the
zoo?
unknown
speaker
so
the
zoo
is
just
one
of
the
features
of
overton
park?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
on
all
of
these
things
you're
telling
us
certainly
relate
to
the
wisdom
of
the
decisions
made
by
these
various
bodies,
but
are
there
very
many
street
closings
in
which
there
are
not
disputes,
arguments
over
whether
it
should
or
should
not
be
closed?
unknown
speaker
but
your
claim
here
really
isn't
one
of
denial
of
procedural
due
process.
you
would
say,
if
you'd
had
all
the
procedure
in
the
world,
at
least,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
said
it
would
still
be
a
violation
of
1982,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
chambliss,
that
irrespective
of
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
racial
motivation
or
intent
has
to
be
proved
under
1982,
irrespective
of
that,
that
for
procedural
due
process
reasons
you're
entitled
to
an
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
going
to
get
to
the
question
whether
1982
was--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
thirteenth,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
we
should
read
their
opinion
as
saying
that
even
if
intent
is
necessary,
it
is
present
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
and
without
ruling
on
whether
intent
is
an
essential
element,
if
it
is,
it's
here?
unknown
speaker
intent,
mr.
chambliss...
intent
to
be
inferred
from
impact
or
express,
or
proof
of
express
impact?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
let
me
try
what
my
brother
brennan
was
talking
about.
if
this
court
decides
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
and
we
don't
go
any
further,
would
you
be
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
you're
getting
me
worried
as
to
whether
that's
true
or
not.
unknown
speaker
they
said
it
was
a
badge
of
servitude.
as
i
read
their
opinion,
they
didn't
conclude
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
question
of
specific
intent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
a
1982.
what
does
badge
of
slavery
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
more
directly.
is
"badge
of
slavery"
a
code
word
for
intent?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
for
violation
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
if
there
is
a
"badge
of
slavery",
that's
a
violation
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
without
regard
to
whether
it's
done
intentionally
or
otherwise.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
language
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
says.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
that
the
court
made
findings,
you're
speaking
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
arlington
heights
a
fourteenth
amendment
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position,
then,
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
intent,
or
that
it
simply
found
intent
was
unnecessary
to
find
a
violation
of
1982?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
would
the
argument
be
different
if
hein
park
were
an
integrated
neighborhood?
unknown
speaker
because
your
opponent
said...
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
record,
but
your
opponent
said
it's
now
an
integrated
neighborhood.
unknown
speaker
see,
the
legal
issue
in
some
ways
would
remain
the
same,
because
the
impact
would
still
be
on
excluding
traffic
that
was
primarily
black.
and
i'm
wondering
if
you
would
have
the
same
theory
if
an
integrated
neighborhood
interested
in
reducing
the
amount
of
traffic
to
which...
when
children
play
in
the
streets
and
that
sort
of
thing,
were
to
cut
off
a
traffic
flow
that
was
primarily
black,
but
the
neighborhood
itself
was
mixed?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
change
it.
supposing
all
the
facts
were
exactly
the
same
in
this
case,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
residents
of
hein
park
were
half
black
and
half
white.
would
you
make
the
same
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reason
for
it
is,
the
impact
of
the
interference
with
traffic
would
still
be
primarily
against
blacks.
unknown
speaker
can
it
ever
be
legitimate
to
block
a
street
that
is
primarily
used
by
blacks?
unknown
speaker
when
some
of
the
people
who
benefit
from
the
blocking
are
white?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chambliss,
before
you
sit
down,
do
you
have
any
comment
at
all
on
palmer
v.
thompson,
the
swimming
pool
case?
unknown
speaker
it
is
correct
that
the
map
in
the
hein
park
amicus
brief
leaves
out--
unknown
speaker
--the
zoo
entrance
that
mr.
chambliss'
map
shows,
and
that's
a
rather
material
fact.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
the
shortest...
you
do
agree
his
map
is
correct?
unknown
speaker
so,
at
the
least
it's
a
lot
closer
to
the
south
end
of
west
drive
than
the
map
in
the
hein
park
brief
would
suggest?
unknown
speaker
but
no
map
was
introduced
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
it
worried
me
as
to
what
we're
dealing
with.
well,
there
are
official
city
maps
of
memphis,
aren't
there?
unknown
speaker
you
can
find
them
from
any
chamber
of
commerce,
i
suppose,
or
travel
agency.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
somebody
give
us
one?
unknown
speaker
or
could
we
buy
one?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there's
a
trial
exhibit
13.
i
don't
know
how
far
it
goes,
but
at
page
132
of
the
appendix,
and
then
at
144
and
145
in
the
appendix
you
come
up
with
the
map
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think,
earlier
referred
to.
now,
was
that
map
ever
introduced
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
would
ask
one
other
point
of
information.
when
was
the
entrance
to
the
zoo
changed
from
near
university
avenue
to
where
it
presently
is?
unknown
speaker
was
it
before
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
that
change
took
place
after
the
council's
decision?
unknown
speaker
so
the
hein
park
people
got
us
a
pretty
old
map,
is
what
happened.
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
submit
another
map,
you
and
your
counsel,
you
friend
and
you
will
agree
on
the
map?
unknown
speaker
then
the
entrance
wasn't
closed
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
really
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
find
out?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
can
get
agreement
from
mr.
chambliss
on
the
date?
