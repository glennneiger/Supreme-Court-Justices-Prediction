justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case,
the
city
of
memphis
against
greene
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
arose
as
a
result
of
a
decision
by
the
city
of
memphis
to
close
the
north
end
of
a
street
that
traverses
a
white
residential
community
known
as
hein
park.
although
the
street
closing
will
not
cut
off
access
to
hein
park,
it
will
require
the
diversion
of
a
substantial
volume
of
traffic
that
heretofore
has
gone
through
that
community
on
its
way
to
the
central
district
of
the
city.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
drivers
who
will
be
inconvenienced
by
the
closing
reside
in
black
neighborhoods
to
the
north
of
hein
park
and
the
fact
that
the
benefits
of
the
closing
will
inure
it
to
the
white
residents
of
hein
park.
this
action
was
brought
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
black
plaintiffs
who
contended
that
the
closing
violated
a
federal
statute
42
u.s.c.
section
1982
which
provides
that
all
citizens
shall
have
the
same
right
as
it
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens
to
inherit,
purchase,
sell,
hold,
and
convey
real
and
personal
property.
after
extensive
proceedings
in
the
lower
courts,
the
district
court
ultimate
found
that
the
closing
was
not
motivated
by
any
racial
hostility
and
that
its
adverse
impact
on
the
plaintiff
class
was
not
sufficiently
significant
to
constitute
a
violation
either
of
the
statute
or
of
the
thirteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
without
setting
aside
any
of
the
specific
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court.
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
closing
is
adequately
justified
by
the
city's
interest
in
managing
the
flow
of
traffic
within
its
boundaries
and
attempting
to
preserve
the
comparative
quiet
of
the
residential
neighborhood
and
that
it
does
not
have
the
kind
of
impact
on
the
property
interest
of
the
plaintiff
class
to
bring
it
within
the
reach
of
section
1982.
we
also
hold
that
the
closing
did
not
violate
the
thirteenth
amendment.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
and
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
