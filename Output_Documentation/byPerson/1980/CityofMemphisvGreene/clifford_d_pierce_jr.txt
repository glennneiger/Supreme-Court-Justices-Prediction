mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
memphis
petitioned
for
certiorari
in
this
court
solely
because
of
what
we
perceive
to
be
a
clear
and
inherent
danger
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
6th
circuit
to
the
ability
of
this
nation's
cities
to
effectively
balance
all
the
conflicting
interests
which
come
before
them
and
effectively
govern.
in
short,
we
saw
the
danger
which
we
believe
judge
celebrezze
saw,
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
judge
celebrezze
having
been
mayor
of
one
of
the
great
cities
of
this
country,
and
also,
some
of
the
concerns
that
were
expressed
by
this
court
in
washington
v.
davis.
in
every
democracy,
the
legislative
and
administrative
parts
of
that
democracy
have
the
burden
to
weigh
conflicting
and
competing
interests.
inevitably,
in
any
such
decision,
there
will
be
winners
and
losers.
and
depending
upon
whose
ox
is
gored,
the
party
that
is
not
successful
will
feel
either
irritated
or
disappointed
or
in
some
respects
angered.
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
started
as
a
routine
street
closing.
it
started,
not
with
the
city
itself,
but
with
residents
of
a
small
winding
neighborhood
street
in
a
subdivision
known
as
hein
park.
the
reason
which
these
neighbors
gave
abutting
this
street
was
the
fact
that
this
very
narrow,
less
than
two-lane
street,
or
approximately
two-lane
street,
had
taken
on
a
tremendous
amount
of
traffic.
they
sought
to
control
the
traffic
going
through
that
small
residential
neighborhood.
they
sought
to
protect
the
pedestrians,
both
those
living
within
the
neighborhood
and
without
the
neighborhood,
particularly
the
children
who
were
walking
to
and
from
school.
they
also
sought
to
control
litter
and
pollution,
things
that
go
with
traffic,
unfortunately,
and
things
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
being
a
legitimate
purpose
to
control.
west
drive
itself,
as
i
have
indicated,
is
a
very
narrow,
winding,
almost
country-type
street.
there
are
no
curbs
or
gutters
or
sidewalks.
it
is,
at
its
entrance
into
jackson
avenue,
about
25
feet
wide.
if
cars
are
parked
on
either
side,
it
ceases
to
be
a
two-lane
street.
hein
park
itself
is
a
small
in-town,
inner
city
neighborhood
approximately
60
years
old.
the
geographical
borders
are
such
that
it
is
bordered
on
three
sides
by
major
streets,
four
and
six-lane
streets,
most
of
which
carry
heavy
commercial
traffic.
west
drive,
as
it
comes
into
jackson
avenue,
which
is
one
of
these
major
commercial
streets
and
is
on
the
north
side,
is,
as
i
have
indicated,
25
feet
wide.
jackson
avenue--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--it's
an
extremely
poor
map,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
is
a
slightly
better
map
in
the
brief
submitted
by
the
amicus
curiae
from
the
hein
park
civic
association.
it
is
at
least
more
legible.
i
regret
sincerely
there
is
not
a
better
map.
i
think
that
that,
although
it's
not
drawn
to
scale,
i
believe
that
you
can
judge
the
streets
better
from--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--yes,
i
believe
that's
clearer.
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes.
west
drive.
and
what's
springdale?
is
that
the
wide
street
you
mentioned?
springdale
is
the
wide
street.
yes,
sir,
it's
in
yellow.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
that's
the
one
on
the
north;
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
that
is
on
the
other
side
of
jackson
avenue.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
jackson
avenue
is
approximately
six
lanes
wide.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
well,
it...
across
it;
yes,
sir.
now,
a
word
about
hein
park,
about
the
subdivision
itself.
as
i've
stated,
it
is
a
small
in-town
neighborhood,
an
inner
city
neighborhood.
the
streets
are
small
and
winding,
the
houses
vary
from
rather
small
homes
to
rather
large
homes.
one
thing
i
think
is
particularly
significant
in
view
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
is
that
there
are,
in
addition
to
west
drive,
there
are
seven
other
entrances
into
this
subdivision.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
the
boundaries
of
hein
park,
your
honor,
would
be--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
this
is
the
map
that
is
attached
to
the
brief
submitted
by
the
hein
park
civic
association;
not
very
good,
but
it's
the
best
we
have.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
but
it's
virtually
illegible.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
that's
correct.
--you're
right.
that
does
not
include
the
whole
hein
park.
it
does
include
just
basically
west
drive
and
center
drive.
that
might
give
some
better
idea
of
the
location
of
the
barrier
and
how
it
fits
into
west
drive.
it
does
not
include
all
of
hein
park.
hein
park,
as
we
look
to
the
map
in
the
amicus
brief,
is
bounded
by
jackson
avenue
on
the
north,
trezevant
street
on
the
east,
north
parkway
on
the
south,
and,
actually,
charles
place,
which
runs
into
west
drive,
on
the
west.
to
the
west
of
that
is
southwestern
university.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
north
parkway
is
a
major
thoroughfare.
north
drive
is,
if
anything
smaller
than
west
drive.
it's
a
very
narrow,
small--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--within
hein
park;
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir?
is
to
the
south.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir,
a
very
large
park,
and
as
seen
on
this
map--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--located
to
the
south;
yes,
sir.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
map
will
show
this,
there
are
seven
other
entrances
into
hein
park,
including
two
from
the
north,
so
that,
one
of
the
complaints
made
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
was
that
they
wanted
to
come
down
springdale
street,
and
that
they
were
being
effectively
shut
out
of
hein
park
and
would
not
to
be
permitted
to
come
into
hein
park
for
racial
or
other
reasons.
actually,
all
they
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
make
a
turn
either
to
the
east
or
to
the
west
of
about
100
feet.
if
they
turn
to
the
east
100
feet,
they
can
proceed
into
cypress
drive,
which
runs
into
center
drive,
which
runs
right
into
north
parkway.
if
they
go
to
the
west,
they
can
go
about
100
feet,
they
can
go
into
charles
place,
which
runs
into
west
drive,
and
they
will
be
back
out
again
at
the
parkway.
the
other
entrances
into
hein
park
are
at
north
drive
and
at
east
drive,
on
the
east,
of
course;
center
drive
on
the
west,
on
the
south;
and
charles
place,
which
runs
in,
in
effect,
from
southwestern,
to
the
west.
that
i
think
would
indicate
the
traffic
patterns,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
is
indicated
in
the
testimony,
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
city
to
support
inner
city
neighborhoods.
this
is
certainly
an
inner
city
neighborhood,
and
one
deemed
worthy
of
support,
as
are
all.
the
neighbors
themselves
sought
what
we
believe
were
legitimate
constitutional
reasons
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
within
that
neighborhood.
the
disparate
impact,
if
it
exists,
i
believe
was
properly
pointed
out
by
judge
celebrezze,
really
exists
between
residents
and
nonresidents.
it
is
perhaps
a
little
more
convenient
for
those
living
on
west
drive,
that
they
would
be
most
likely
to
proceed
to
the
south
and
to
go
onto
north
parkway,
than
the
others,
who
may
want
to
come
across,
but
that
it
is
certainly
not
a
racial
impact,
really
one
of
geography.
the
record
reflects,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
proper
procedures
were
followed
in
this
case.
the
residents
filed
a
petition,
they
went
before
the
planning
commission.
the
planning
commission
did
as
it
does
in
all
other
types
of
street
closings
and
alley
closings.
it
made
an
inquiry
of
all
the
city
divisions
and
asked
for
the
opinion
of
the
division
officers
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
closed.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
the
planning
commission,
your
honor?
the
planning
commission,
your
honor,
is
made
up...
i'm
not
certain
of
the
racial
makeup
of
the
planning
commission.
i'm
confident
there
are
some
black
members
of
the
planning
commission.
the
city
council
has
three
black
councilmen
out
of
13.
the
planning
commission
is
merely
a
recommending
body.
all
land
use
matters
go
before
the
planning
commission
for
its
recommendation.
the
planning
commission
itself
is
made
up
of
citizen
members,
some
appointed
by
the
city
and
some
appointed
by
the
country.
the
planning
commission
has
a
staff,
of
course,
of
professionals.
and
then
the
board
members
themselves
vote
and
pass
their
recommendations
on
along
to
the
city
council,
which
must
vote
it
up
or
down.
the
record
does
reflect
that
proper
hearings
were
made,
that
a
hearing
took
place
before
the
planning
commission,
a
hearing
took
place
before
the
city
council.
this
was
a
contested
matter.
it
certainly
was
not
something
that
was
breezed
or
slipped
through.
there
were
some
very
strong
opinions
about
it,
one
reason
being
it
was
the
first
time
it
had
really
been
done.
on
a
number
of
occasions
streets
had
been
closed.
most
of
them
had
not
been
opened
before;
they
had
been
dedicated
to
the
city
but
had
not
been
opened
to
through
traffic.
on
other
occasions
alleys
had
been
closed
that
actually
had
been
opened
to
through
traffic
but
were
closed
on
request
of
property
owners
that
abutted
the
alleys.
this
case
was
handled
just
like
every
other
case.
there
was
a
very
active
hearing
before
the
council,
and
i
might
state
to
your
honors
that
in
the
hearing
before
the
council
race
was
really
not
an
issue.
i
think
one
gentleman
made
some
comments
about
the
racial
aspect
of
it.
but
really,
virtually
none
of
the
complainants
at
that
particular
time,
white
or
black,
made
any
comment
about
the
racial
aspect
of
it.
none
of
the
councilmen,
certainly
not
the
black
councilmen
or
the
white
councilmen,
made
any
comment
whatsoever
about
this
being
a
racial
matter.
it
was
debated,
i
think,
because
it
was
unusual.
it
was
because
this
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
this
type
of
planning,
too,
had
been
used
to
present--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
yes,
sir.
it
was
not
until
after
the
hearing,
mr.
justice
stevens,
when
the
city
council
had
listened
to
both
sides,
had
debated
among
itself,
had
taken
a
vote
and
decided,
not
unanimously,
i
might
add,
on
a
split
vote,
had
decided
that
this
was
a
proper
tool,
that
it
was
a
reasonable--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--the
vote,
i
think,
was
7-5,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
not
until
after
this
time
that
the
matter
of
race
come
up,
and
it
came
up
on
a
petition
to
rehear,
and
ultimately
a
petition
to
reopen.
now,
one
word
with
respect
to
the
barrier
itself.
the
barrier
is
not
the
berlin
wall.
the
way
it
is
established,
it
consists
of
two
low
curbs,
one
abutting
jackson
avenue,
one
abutting
west
drive.
there
is
a
small
planting
area
between
jackson
avenue
and
the
sidewalk.
there
is
then
a
sidewalk
which
is
a
continuation
of
all
the
other
sidewalks
along
jackson
avenue,
which
abuts
the
blacktop.
so
one
point
that
was
raised
by
the
plaintiffs
in
their
brief
that
there
would
be
a
problem
with
pedestrian
traffic
is
simply
not
true.
there
is
no
way
that
there
would
be
a
trespass,
technical
or
otherwise,
for
pedestrians
desiring
to
come
off
of
jackson
avenue
and
go
onto
west
drive.
they
can
walk
down
the
blacktop,
or
under
our
city
ordinances,
where
there
are
no
sidewalks,
they're
permitted
to
walk
within
10
feet
off
the
road,
without
any
danger
of
trespassing.
so
there
is
no
technical
trespass
or
otherwise.
now,
the
court
is,
i'm
certain,
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
original
petition,
complaint,
filed
in
this
cause
was
dismissed
and
this
case
went
to
the
6th
circuit.
and
the
court
remanded
that
back
to
the
district
court,
setting
out
some
rather
basic
ground
rules,
primarily
a
ground
rule
that
for
the
plaintiffs
to
prevail
there
had
to
be
discriminatory
intent,
and
intent
shown
that
the
city
of
memphis
had
granted
to
these
residents
of
this
predominantly
white,
or
white
residential
area,
a
right
that
they
had
not
granted
to
black
citizens
within
the
city
of
memphis.
during
the
hearing
of
the
trial
court,
that
statement
from
the
6th
circuit,
which
it
later
in
greene
ii
stated
was
dicta,
we
urged
that
upon
the
court,
that
that
was
really
the
issue
facing
him,
judge
mcrae,
in
that
hearing,
on
the
whole
matter.
the
judge
did
not
agree
with
that.
instead
he
had
a
full
hearing.
he
had,
in
effect,
an
arlington
heights
hearing.
he
let
everything
in.
the
plaintiffs
were
permitted
to
produce
every
bit
of
evidence
they
had
with
respect
to
racial
impact,
and
with
respect
to
racial
intent.
the
respondents
have
argued
that
the
trial
judge...
and
so
did
the
majority
in
the
6th
circuit...
argued
that
the
trial
judge
had
felt
himself
too
constrained
by
the
mandate
of
the
6th
circuit
in
greene
i.
and
it
was
because
of
that
constraint
that
he
found
no
intent.
it's
simply
not
true.
as
i
indicated,
the
record
will
indicate
a
very
full
hearing
on
this
matter.
all
issues
were
debated.
and
at
the
conclusion,
the
trial
court
determined
that
certainly
no
starkness
existed
on
which
to
place
a
badge
of
slavery.
he
determined
that
on
the
record
before
him,
the
proof
adduced
in
that
case
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
proving
that
there
was
any
discriminatory
intent
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
memphis,
in
placing
this
barrier
at
west
drive.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
your
honor,
the
record
reflects
that
approximately
three
years
before...
i
think,
back
in
1970,
the
neighbors
became
concerned
about
the
traffic
pattern,
and
if
i
may
digress
one
minute
to
say
something
about
the
hein
park
neighborhood,
as
i
indicated
to
you,
this
neighborhood
is
about
60
years
old,
and
for
a
long
period
of
time
it
was
made
up
of
a
lot
of
original
residents,
senior
citizen,
elderly
people.
since
that
time,
and
in
the
past
decade
or
so,
younger
people
and
young
middle-aged
people
have
moved
into
this
neighborhood,
have
reclaimed
these
old
houses,
and
have
started
to
repair
them
and
fix
them
up
and
turn
them
into
a
better
neighborhood.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
largely
white,
but
it
is
now
integrated,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
the
advent
of
young,
small
children
was
something
new
in
hein
park.
there
really
had
not
been
many
of
them
around.
all
of
a
sudden,
there
were
a
lot
of
them
around.
and
i
think
this
created
a
very
real
concern
for
the
citizens
in
hein
park,
and
they
started
about
1970
feeling
a
great
concern
about
this.
and
they
talked
to
people
within
the
city,
they
talked
to
bob
fosnaugh,
who
was
then
the
traffic
engineer,
and
they
had
suggested
trying
to
close
off
the
whole
park,
to
see
if
they
couldn't
do
something
about
this.
that
was
obviously
rejected
as
being
unreasonable,
but
a
suggestion
was
made
to
them
at
that
time
that
the
real
culprit
in
this
area
was
the
traffic
that
was
coming
through
west
drive,
that
if
they
could
somehow
shut
off
that
major...
what
had
become
a
country
lane
into
a
major
thoroughfare
through
a
very
small,
quiet
residential
area,
if
they
could
protect
that
neighborhood
they
could
protect
those
children.
and
this
suggestion,
really,
of
just
stopping
traffic
at
that
one
point
came
originally
from
someone
within
the
city
saying,
that's
something
you
might
point
toward.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
justice
marshall,
i'm
not...
i
think
the
court
indicated
that
it
was.
the
area
to
the
north--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--probably
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
it.
i
would
state
that
the--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the
area
to
the
north
is
in
a
sense
divided.
as
you
go
down
springdale,
the
area
east
of
springdale
is
predominantly
black.
the
area
west
of
springdale
is
predominantly
white.
so
there
is
a
mixture,
certainly,
of
white
and
black
traffic
through
there.
but
the
court
found
that
the
impact
would
be
more
on
black
citizens
than
on
white
citizens,
so
i'm
stuck
with
that.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
an
absence
of
intent
was
found
by
the
district
court.
it
was
found
by
judge
celebrezze,
and
possibly
by
the
majority
of
the
6th
circuit.
we
have
some
problems
understanding
exactly
what
they've
said.
but
judge
celebrezze
is
certainly
of
the
opinion
that
the
6th
circuit
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
1982.
we
believe
that
1982
does
and
should
require
a
finding
of
racial
motivation
and
intent.
the
decisions
of
this
court
would
indicate
that
is
a
path
which
this
court
would
have
us
follow.
going
back
to
the
dicta
in
jones
v.
alfred
h.
mayer,
talking
about
all
racially
motivated
conduct,
and
following
the
line
of
cases
of
this
court,
in
washington
v.
davis,
in
arlington
heights,
and
in
personnel
administrator
v.
feeney,
the
path
which
this
court
has
indicated
to
us
is
that
racially
motivated,
racial
intent
should
be
a
requirement
under
1982.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i
agree.
i
agree,
your
honor.
that
is
a
question.
i'm
very
frank
to
admit
we
have
trouble
with
understanding
the
majority
opinion.
judge--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--that
1982
is
not
applicable?
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
was
really
raised
as
much.
it
was
suggested.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i
can't
say
if
it
was
any
at
all.
it
was
mentioned,
your
honor--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
it
was
pleaded
in
the
complaint,
yes,
your
honor.
but
as
i
say,
as
judge
celebrezze
indicated,
he
felt
that
the
district
judge
certainly
treated
this
as
1983
case,
or
as
a
case
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
an
equal
protection
case.
but
the
6th
circuit,
the
majority
opinion,
seems
to
indicate
that
they
find
it
a
1982
violation.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
the
intent,
i
believe,
has
to
run
to
the
intent
of
the
decisionmakers,
and
here
it
is
the
decision-making
by
the
city
council.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that's
not
so.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
that
is
not
my
statement.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
what's
short
of
that?
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
this
court
in
arlington
heights,
mr.
justice
marshall,
has
set
a
standard,
has
set
a
basis.
it
has
softened,
in
effect,
the
requirements
that
it
might
have
found
in
washington
v.
davis,
by
saying
that
the
court
should
make
a
sensitive
inquiry
into
the
background,
and
the
question
was
asked
of
me
whether
or
not,
solely
because
some...
some...
we
had
a
bigot
in
hein
park
who
was
a
member
of
the
klan,
that
solely
because
of
his
reasoning
that
it
should
be
considered
constitutionally
improper?
i
don't
think
that
just
solely
because
of
that
it
should
be.
but
that
is
something
to
took
at,
that
is
something
that
is
a
factor
that
can
be
considered
in
all
of
the
relevant
circumstances
as
indicated
in
the
arlington
heights
case,
and
i
think
that
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
think
that
the
court
can
look
at
the
record,
it
can
look
at
what
was
said,
it
can
look
at
whether
it's
a
totally
different
concept,
it
can
look
at
whether
the
procedure
was
followed,
it
can
look
if
the
substantive
things
were
true.
all
the
tests
set
out
in
arlington,
i
think,
are
the
kinds
of
tests
that
should
be
used
to
determine,
because
obviously--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is,
and...
but
there's
at
stake--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--there
is
a
distinction
between
this
and
what
this
court
did
in
griggs,
because
griggs
was
approaching
a
title
vii
question.
1982,
of
course,
is
under
the
old
civil
rights
statutes.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
very
broad,
with
no
restrictions.
and
as
i
think
judge
celebrezze
saw,
that
to
permit
it
without
any
kind
of
restrictions
would
put
this
court
and
all
courts
in
a
situation
where
they
would
be
weighing
these
policy
decisions
that
the
congress
had
never
weighed,
purely
under
the
guise
of
construing
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
justice
powell?
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
think
this
case
was
tried
as
an
arlington
heights
case.
i
think
it
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
that
test
that
this
court
established
in
arlington
heights.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
that
i
have,
i'm
sure,
a
very
short
period
of
time
to
cover
a
lot
of
ground.
number
one,
due
process
is
not
an
issue,
if
the
court
please.
this
is...
the
whole
argument
mr.
chambliss
has
been
making
about
procedures
were
not
followed,
this
was
brought
up
and
discussed
ad
nauseam
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
both
of
those
decisions,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
found
no
due
process
violations.
they
found
that
the
procedures
were
proper
and
it
was
not
appealed
from,
and
i
believe
it's
been
foreclosed
in
this
court.
mr.
chambliss
keeps
mentioning
about
sidewalks.
there
are
sidewalks,
and
there
is
proof
in
the
record
that
there
are
areas
all
over
memphis,
in
black
neighborhoods
and
white
neighborhoods,
mixed
neighborhoods,
where
there
are
no
sidewalks,
where
there
are
no
curbs
and
gutters.
there
are
reasons
for
that.
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
issue
here.
it
was
brought
up
originally
in
the
original
complaint
that
was
filed
by
mr.
greene
in
his
official,
first
complaint;
which
i
think
there
were
four
complaints
filed
before
the
case
ever
got
up.
that
was
one
of
his
original
complaints.
the
question
of
speed
breakers.
under
the
common
law
of
tennessee,
cities
may
not
have
speed
breakers
on
through
streets,
on
open
streets.
so
that
was
foreclosed.
that
question
was
asked
by
a
member
of
the
city
council
and
he
was
advised
of
that
fact
at
that
particular
time.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
map
situation,
mr.
justice
stevens
made
some
statements
about
that.
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
deceive
on
anyone's
part.
if
i
may
see
mr.--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i
think
the
reason
that
it
does--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--i
don't
agree
it's
correct.
i
believe
it
is
closer.
university,
as
shown
in
the
brief
attached
to
the
appendix,
and
actually
in
the
brief
attached
to
the
brief
submitted
by
the
hein
park
civic
club,
is
shown
as
being
opened,
and
opened
into
the
park.
actually,
that
has
now
been
closed.
this
entrance
is
farther
down,
and
it
is
in
between
university
and
west.
traffic
coming
down
university
would
turn
this
way;
traffic
coming
down
west
or
coming
down
trezevant,
or
coming
down
center
drive
would
turn
that
way.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir;
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
can't
speak
to
that,
other
than
the
maps
that
were
put
in
as
part
of
the
planning
commission
procedure
at
that
time.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
certainly,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we'll
be
happy--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--we'll
be
happy
to
supply
those.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
we'll
be
happy
to
supply
those,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
try
the
case
originally
before
the
district
court.
i
do
not
recall
if
it
was
or
not.
it
is
part
of
the
record,
i
believe.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm--
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
--no,
not
before
the
trial.
no,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
no,
excuse
me.
you
mean,
before
the
actual
hearing
in
1978?
yes,
sir,
it
was
closed
long
before
that.
i'm
not
certain
when,
but
it's
been
closed
a
good
bit
of
time.
i
doubt
if
it
was
closed
in
1973
or
earlier
than
that.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i'm
afraid
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
the
first
request?
that
really
goes
back,
i
believe,
to
1970.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
no,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
d.
pierce,
jr.
mr.
chambliss
and
i
will
get
together
on
that,
and
advise
the
court.
