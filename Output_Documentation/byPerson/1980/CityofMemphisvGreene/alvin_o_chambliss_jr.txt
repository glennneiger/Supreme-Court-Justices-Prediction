mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.

[recess.]
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
start
off
by
attempting
to
explain
to
you
the
situation
here
as
it
relates
to
the
community-factor
situation.
now,
the
judge
found
in
effect
that
hein
park
is
bounded
by
jackson
ave.
on
the
north,
university
street
to
the
west;
to
the
east,
trezevant
avenue,
and
to
the
south--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--trezevant.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
yes.
and
to
the
south,
north
parkway.
the
court
found
as
a
fact,
and
we
contended,
that
the
lower
court's
findings
of
fact
was
correct
but
the
conclusions
of
law,
was
incorrect.
they
found,
first
of
all,
that
hein
park
was
a
community
that
was
developed
in
1940
for
exclusively
white
and
the
character
of
that
community
remained.
they
found,
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
area
to
the
north,
the
vollintine
and
evergreen
area,
was
predominantly
black.
the
district
court
found...
the
following
facts
and
sequence
of
events.
on
or
around
1970
the
residents
in
hein
park
filed
application
with
the
city
to
get
the
street
closed.
that
application
was
summarily
denied.
another
application
was
filed
in
'72;
that
was
rejected.
and
i
think
the
city
planner
did
tell
them
that
instead
of
trying
to
close
all
of
the
street,
they
should
close
the
street
here,
and
pursue
it
at
jackson
avenue.
and
i
must
add
that
springdale
is
the
logical
extension
of
west
drive.
so
they
closed...
there
was
a
planning
commission
hearing.
now,
let
me
explain
to
the
court
here,
that
at
the
planning
commission
hearing
no
one
received
notice
other
than
the
residents
of
hein
park.
the
plan...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
does
not
disclose
in
the
district
court
just
when
that
planning
commission
hearing
was
held.
we
do
also
know
that
the
application
for
the
closure
was
filed
in
july,
i
think
july
9,
1973,
and
the
planning
commission
decided
on
november
3,
1973,
to
recommend
closure.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
yes.
it's
a
replica.
the
clerk
had
another
copy
that
was
loaned.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
it's
incorrect,
your
honor,
if
that's
what
it
shows.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
that's
the
issue
in
this
particular
case,
that's
one
of
the
main
issues.
most
of
the
residents
from
the
vollintine
area
used
this
passage
for
the
snowden
elementary
school--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--that
they
used
this
entrance
right
there...
snowden,
many
walked
to
snowden
elementary
school.
many
used
this
entrance
at
jackson
avenue
and
springdale
to
go
to
the
park
and
zoo,
and
as
you
can
see,
there
are
many,
many
amenities
in
that
park
and
zoo,
and
of
course
this
court
is
well
aware
of
overton
park
v.
volpe,
where
you
set
out
what's
in
that
park.
but
i
submit
on
the
procedure
issue...
are
i
think
we
need
to
get
the
facts
straight
on
procedure--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--yes.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
public
hearing
was
scheduled
and
then
from
the
record,
and
abruptly
not
scheduled.
they
decided
to
close
the
street
one
month
ahead
of
the
public...
well,
they
decided
to
close,
not
have
the
public
hearing,
but
rather
to
have
a
closed
planning
commission
hearing.
now,
at
this
planning
commission
hearing,
the
only
persons
who
were
invited
to
that
hearing
was
the
people
in
this
area.
there
was
two
families,
white
families,
that
objected
to
the
closing.
ms.
sarah
terry,
and
the
thomas
family
objected
to
this
closing.
at
the
time
they
were
told
that
everybody
that
abutted
the
affected
area
would
have
to
sign
the
petition.
once
ms.
sarah
terry
and
ms.
thomas
decided
not
to
participate,
then
they
changed
their
procedure
and
they
basically
decided
that
if
these
two
homeowners
would--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--if
the
two
northernmost-homeowners
would
consent
to
add
their
names
to
the
petition,
the
city
in
effect
would
deed
the
land,
a
25-foot
slip
of
land
in
the
middle,
here,
and
half
would
go
here
and
half
would
go
here.
they
put
up
barricades,
extensions
of
the
sidewalks,
with
little
holes
and
with
dirt,
and
of
course
they
extended
this
sidewalk
across
it.
that
was
the
plan
that
was
submitted
for
the
closing,
after
modification.
there
was
a
public
hearing
without
notice
held
in
january,
i
think
january
29.
and
at
that
hearing
there
were
approximately
40
or
50
people
against
the
closing,
and
of
course
there
was
numerous
other
people,
hein
park
residents,
who
were
in
favor
of
the
closing.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
many,
many
features
of
overton
park
here,
and
i
think,
i
submit
that
in
the
brief
they
talk
about
there's
not
far
to
go,
and
what's
been
cut
off
from
the
distance,
but
most
of
these
people
rely
on
this
area,
not
only
to
go
to
the
park
and
the
zoo,
there's
an
academy
of
arts,
the
shell
where
children
play,
there's
a
swimming
pool
out
in
this
area,
and
there's
a
golf
course,
there's
brooks
memorial
art
gallery,
and
various
other
things
not
shown
here.
but
that's,
as
i
see
it,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
have
traffic.
now,
there's
been
no
showing
in
the
record
that
there
was
heavy
commercial
traffic.
all
the
traffic
that
was
offensive
and
it's
in
the
record,
and
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
"undesirable"
traffic
out,
and
we
submit
that
those
are
catch-all
phrases.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
bringing
our
tension,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
the
unique
fact
here
justifies
the
relief.
i
start
off
by
saying
that
in
your
decision,
richards,
arlington
county
v.
richards,
if
we
could
start
off
on
that
particular
case.
now,
that
was
a
case
in
arlington
where
they
were
talking
about
off-street
parking
by
i
guess
residents
here,
commuters.
but
in
that
particular
case,
it
was
significantly
different.
first
of
all,
there
was
the
elaborate
hearing
procedure.
there
was
a
statutory
scheming
that
was
applied
equally
to
the
whole
county;
pursuant
to
that
claim,
that
scheme,
they
came
up
with
a
formula,
not
just
one
particular
area,
but
they
came
up
with
a
general
formula
whereby
if
a
certain
amount
of
cars
was
in
a
neighborhood,
the
city
manager
would
take
a
survey.
then
those
people,
in
effect
would
apply.
and
of
course
we
submit
in
this
particular
case,
we
think
that's
a
municipal
land
use
case.
again,
i
think
it's
a
disputed
matter,
that
this
is
not
a
traditional
land
use
case,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
there's
testimony
in
the
record
from
the
city
planner,
mr.
miller,
that
the
reason
why
the
city
didn't
use...
well,
usually
land-use
matter
zoning,
they
use
an
ordinance,
and
of
course
that
takes
public
hearings,
notice,
an
elaborate
scheme.
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
was
basically,
somebody
decided
to
accomplish
indirectly
what
they
couldn't
accomplish
directly.
they
had
a
hearing
before
the
public,
the
planning
commission.
thereafter
they
had
a
city
council
hearing
when
no
notice
was
given
out.
well,
the
record
indicates
that
ms.
terry,
who
was
a
white
landowner
here
that
objected,
was
given
written
notice
of
the
hearing.
people
showed
up
at
the
hearing,
the
allotted
15
minutes
to
the
pros
and
cons,
and
then
voted
on
it,
on
the
closing.
now,
after
they
voted
on
the
closing,
there
was
another
hearing
that
was
held
to
reconsider.
there
was...
it
is
a
part
of
the
record,
in
that
particular
hearing
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
serious
procedural
due
process
problem.
so
they
decided
to
vote,
not
rule
on
it,
on
the
reconsideration
then;
they
took
it
over
to
another,
to
the
26th,
that's
in
the
record.
on
the
26th
of
february,
1974,
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
councilmen
thought
that
they
had
violated
the
law.
they
basically
said,
we
have
some
serious
problems
with
notice.
they
then
decided
that
they
would
have
a
public
hearing,
which
they
had
on
march
5,
which
was
2-1/2,
three
months
after
they
closed
the
street.
and
once
they
had
the
public
hearing,
they
decided
not
to
reopen
it.
the
public
hearing
was
more
or
less
on
whether
or
not
it
should
be
reopened.
and
i
submit
the
record
will
indicate
that
there
was
a
serious
procedural
violation
of
due
process
and
then
was
substantive
proceeding
that
was
also
applicable
in
this
case.
for
an
example,
initially,
and
the
record
would
indicate,
that
all
of
the
property
owners
were
told
that
they
had
to
sign
the
petition.
they
signed
the
petition;
everything
was
in
order.
but--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
that's
right,
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
saying,
and
i
have
a...
what
i'm
trying
to
say
here
is
that
the
trial
court
made
the
correct
finding.
there
were
little
if
any
additional
findings
made
by
the
6th
circuit.
i'm
basically
saying
there
were
a
lot
of
other
findings
that
could
have
been
made
that
weren't
made
either
by
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
for
an
example,
and
i'm
just...
one,
and
i
could
go
on,
but
i
was
saying
of
the
serious
due
process
problem
that
was
not
found
inadequate
by
the
lower
court
and
it's
not
in
the
6th
circuit.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
was
raised
but
i
don't
think
it
was
pressed
that
hard,
but
it
was
raised.
it's
in
the
brief;
that's
correct.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
correct.
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
several
things.
i
think
that--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i'll
start
now,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
there
are
two
decisions
that...
this
decision,
of
course,
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
a
5th
circuit
decision,
jennings
v.
patterson;
i
think
it's
a
1974,
judge
roman.
in
that
particular
decision,
i
think
it
was
gates
v.
georgia
for
an
almost
identical
thing
occurred.
basically
there
was
a
street
closure.
the
city
took
no
steps
but
the
street
closure
was
at
the
point
where
the
black
community
and
the
white
community
met.
and
there
was
one
white
person,
a
white
family
that
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
barricade,
and
of
course
they
had
free
access
to
and
from.
of
course,
the
5th
circuit
had
no
problem
under
both
1982
and
1983
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
saying
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
law.
now,
in
our
particular
case
here,
we
take
two
positions.
we
take,
first
of
all,
we
are
not
sure
and
we
think
that
the
6th
circuit
had
an
adequate
basis
for
either
ruling
under
1982
or
1983,
first
of
all.
and
the
fourteenth
or
the
fifteenth
amendments.
i
take
a
firm
position,
however--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--yes,
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
take
a
firm
position
though,
your
honor,
that
the
1982
statutory
claim
and
that
we
take
the
position
that
the
question
of
whether
intent
of
public
discrimination
is
really
not
before
this
court,
but
if
it
were
i
think
that
we
could
prevail
on
that,
by
the
mere
fact
that--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
a
correct
reading
of
the
6th
circuit
opinion
shows
clearly
that
they
basically
said
that
we
leave
open
the
question
of
whether
or
not
1982
will
be,
leave
open
for
the
intent,
to
show
a
violation
of
1982.
they
left
that
question
open.
it's
in
the
opinion.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
correct.
and
i
submit
that
everything
i
have
said
is
in
addition
to--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--i
think
your
honor,
you
have
impact
plus
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
under
the
arlington
heights,
the
first
that
they
were
talking
about,
and
taking
the
admonition
of
this
particular
court,
the
district
court
found
that
they
had
a
disproportionate
impact
on
the
black
community.
they
made
three
findings
on
impact,
so
impact
is
there.
as
to
the
second
point,
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear
that
the
historical
development
of
the
decision
shows
clearly
that
not
only
were
there
irregularities
in
terms
of
the
procedure
but
i
think
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
official
actions
of
the
decisionmakers
were
less
than
good
faith
because
even
the
people,
the
white
people
who
appeared...
let's
take
for
an
example
ms.
terry,
she--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
several
factors
here,
and
the
6th
circuit
did
not
rule
specifically
on
the
question
of
intent.
they
had
1982
and
1983
and
it
basically
says,
we
find
that
there
was
action
on
both,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
if
you
go
back
to
arlington
heights
and
the
necessity
of
inquiring,
and
you
go
to
the
five
admonitions
of
the
court,
i
think
they
found
each
one.
i
think
there
was
a
substantial
departure
from
the
substantive
area
of
the
law,
i.e.,
they
first
said
everybody
had
to
sign
the
petition,
then
they
changed
in
the
minutes
and
the
record.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
procedural
problems,
you'll
find
that
the
whole
notice
and
the
whole
nature
of
what
was
going
on
was
stark.
the
court
made
a
finding,
this
was
the
first
time
that
there
had
ever
been
a
major
street
closing,
a
thoroughfare.
now,
when
the
case
originally
went
to
the
6th
circuit
and
was
remanded
back,
the
6th
circuit
basically
said
that
to
show
1982
and
1983
you
must
show
number
one,
that
grieved...
that
whites
were
given
or
conferred
benefits
that
blacks
were
denied,
and
you
must
show
that
the
officials
acted
with
racial
angles.
now--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
the
badge
of
slavery
comes
in
in
terms
of
the
barricade.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
property
here--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--i
would
say,
yes,
it
has
to
be.
yes.
and
under
the
limited
1983
and
thirteenth
amendment
cases.
i
wouldn't
apply
this
to
employment,
i
wouldn't
apply
this
to
public--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--that's
correct.
the
thirteenth
amendment,
that's
the
position
we
take,
your
honor.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
self-executing
it
and
proclaiming
universal
freedom.
we
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
if
and
when
you
look
at
this
particular
case,
if
you
look
at
the
aggregate,
and
if
you
take
the
arlington
heights
prerequisites,
you'll
find
each
and
every
one
of
those
elements
there.
the
court
made
findings
that
these
people
up
here
didn't
want
the
black
people
in
the
neighborhood;
the
court
made
finding
that
the
property
here
would
be
appreciated
while
this
property
here
would
be
depreciated.
they
made
excellent
findings,
they
just
ruled
the
other
way.
they
just...
the
threshold
on
the
intent
question
was
just,
we
think,
too
high.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
made
very
little
change
to
it.
the
case
that
you
have
in
this
particular
court
is
pretty
much
the
same
case
you
had
in
the
district
court.
the
only
thing
is,
the
court,
basically,
we
see
impact,
but
we
don't
think
there
was
intent
and
purpose.
that's
what
the
district
court
said.
the
court
of
appeals,
basically,
expanded
on
that
and
he
said,
looking
at
this
thing
from
an
arlington
heights
perspective,
we
find
that
there
was
indeed
a
badge
of
slavery
by
the
mere
fact
that
the
aggregate
of
the
situation
coupled
with
the
impact,
coupled
with
the
statement
that
they
didn't
want
these
people
here,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
they
said
this
was
the
first
time
the
city
had
ever
used
a
street
enclosure...
unused
street.
let
me
say
that
again.
the
procedure
that
was
used
was
unused
streets
and
alleys
closed.
there
had
never
been
any
challenge
to
an
unused
street
and
alley
procedure.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
inferred
intent,
we're
dealing
with
circumstantial
evidence.
when
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
the
decisionmakers
meant,
i
think
that
process
that
this
court
announced
is
very
helpful
and
the
district
court,
i
think,
went
through
that
process,
like
able
counsel
here
stated.
but
i
just
think
that
the
threshold
of
the
1982
and
the
whole
intent
element
was
just
a
little
too
high.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
two
things.
i
have
to
answer
that
way.
xx
one,
that
intent
was
unnecessary,
but
intent,
it
was
found
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
that,
and
i
started
off
by
saying,
i
think
this
is
a
very
bad
case
to
deal
with
the
question
of
intent
because
the
record
clearly
shows
all
kinds
of
irregularities,
violations,
and
departure
from
normal
procedure,
and
i
think
on
the
evidence
credited
to
the
district
court,
that
we
prevail
on
the
issue
of
intent.
he
made
findings
of
that.
he
made
findings
about
the
disparate
treatment,
he
made
findings
about
the
first
time
this
procedure
was
being
used,
he
made
findings
the
whites
here
didn't
want
the
blacks
in
the
neighborhood.
there
was
also
additional
evidence
to
show
that
they
wanted
to
cut
out
the
undesirable
element,
there
were
alternative
routes.
for
an
example,
why,
if
you
want
to
stop
the
traffic,
why
not
close
the
street
at
the
southern
end?
or
why
not
put
speed
breakers?
or...
and
this
is
also,
he
found
this,
that
historically
this
neighborhood
is
the
only
area
that
is
without
sidewalks,
so
if
you're
talking
about
safety
of
the
children,
and
there
is
a
law
in
the
city
that
basically
says,
sidewalks
are
a
prerogative,
that
you
consider
a
sidewalk.
schools,
public
playground,
and
parks.
now,
all
of
these
areas,
all
the
black
area
is
sidewalked,
but
west
hein
park
historically
has
never
had
sidewalks.
so
if
you're
thinking
about,
if
you're
talking
about
safety
of
the
children,
why
not
erect
sidewalks?
they
didn't
consider
that.
we
talked
about
putting
speed
breakers.
they
wouldn't
consider
that.
one
council
member
said
that,
when
the
compromise
was
being
worked
out,
she
said,
in
essence,
anything
other
than
a
complete
closure,
we
were
not
going
to
settle
for.
so
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
all
of
the
facts
in
the
circumstances,
using
the
sensitive
inquiry,
that
the
court
will
in
fact
affirm
the
6th
circuit
opinion
of
the
other
court.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
on
these
facts--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
the
judge
made
findings
and
the
findings
are
on
page...
of
the
joint--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
question,
sir.
i
think
that
you
have
several
things
going
here.
you
have
action
to
perpetuate
the
past
effect
of
discrimination.
but
over
and
above
anything,
that
you
have
here
a
departure
from
everything
that
the
city
followed
as
it
relates
to
the--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
really...
i
don't
quite
understand;
if
you
could--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--i
don't
think
but,
see,
i'm
not...
i'm
not,
this
is
a
racial
discrimination
case,
not...
i
don't
doubt
the
wisdom
of
a
city
to
use
its
police
power
for
legitimate
objectives.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
oh,
i
think
in
some
cases--
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
--well,
i
would
say,
in
some
circumstances,
your
honor.
i'm
not
going
to
go
that
far
and
say,
ever.
i
would
say,
in
some
circumstances.
i
think
if
you...
if
a
city
had
the
authority
to
close
a
street
and
they
had
public
hearings
and
it
was
shown,
as
it
was
shown
in
the
arlington
v.
richards
case,
i
think
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
neighborhood
is
black
or
white
if
in
fact
it
is
done
pursuant
to
an
overall
scheme.
now,
some
other
things.
the
city
council
had
before
it
at
this
hearing
some
other
areas
in
the
city
who
had
applied
to
have,
like
here,
to
have
their
street
closed.
i
think
it's
a
dangerous
precedent,
and
i
think
that
for
that
reason
alone
that
the
court
should
look
at
this
very,
very
closely.
mr.
alvin
o.
chambliss,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
i
think
this
case
is
much
different
from
palmer
because
in
palmer
blacks
and
whites
were
denied
the
swimming,
you
know,
swimming...
they
just
closed.
jackson,
mississippi,
just
closed
the
swimming
pool
altogether.
and
i
think
that
this
particular
court
basically
took
the
position
that
there
was
nothing
wrong.
i
think
there
was
an
additional
factor
that
the
city
was
losing
money,
and
that
basically
the
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
look
into
the
motives
of
why
people
vote
for
certain
things,
because
this
is
a
political
give
and
take.
i
think
that's
correct
in
an
appropriate
setting,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
this
is
a
very
different
case,
because
everything
in
this
case
was
done
that
was
contrary
to
the
way
the
city
normally
did
things.
and
i
think
that
given
the
fact
that
this
was
a
black
community,
given
the
fact
that
there
was
a
substantial
departure,
i
think
it's
just...
thank
you.
