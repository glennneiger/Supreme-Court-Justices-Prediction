justice
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
set
aside
the
existing
regulations
of
the
secretary,
did
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
was
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
rehnquist
well
where
you
have
to
show
they
are
either
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
contrary
to
law?
justice
rehnquist
well
i'm
referring
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
rehnquist
we
often
don't
know,
of
course,
with
this
court
of
appeals.
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
true
also
that
under
the
statute,
49
u.s.c.
1396a,
appendix
h,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
these
numbers
and
letters
are
kind
of
difficult
to
cope
with,
but
section
17(b)
in
the
middle
of
the
page
of
35(a)
says
"a
state
plan
for
said
medical
assistance
must
provide
for
taking
into
account
only
such
income
and
resources
as
are...
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary,
available
to
the
applicant
or
recipient
in
determining
his
eligibility
for
such
aid,
assistance
or
recipience.
"
now,
you
have
to
show,
don't
you,
that
that
portion
of
the
secretary's
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
that
congressional
directive
was
either
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
contrary
to
law:
justice
rehnquist
--but
what
congress
said
was
that
the
secretary
shall
issue
regulations
that
shall
define
this--
justice
rehnquist
--distribution...
and
you,
to
say
that
spouses
are
placed
in
an
impossible
situation,
may
lead
one
court
or
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
regulation
is
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
contrary
to
law.
but
congress
did
authorize
the
secretary
to
define
what
shall
be
available.
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
claiming
as
the
result
of
examples
like
that,
that
deeming
is
totally
improper
under
the
statute,
or
that
a
hearing
has
to
be
held
in
every
case?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
what
do
you
make
of
the
subsection
(b)
of
17,
where
it
says
"available"
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
that
the
secretary
shall
prescribe.
don't
you
think
the
secretary
can
prescribe
general
regulations
that
may...
hit
an
occasional
person
very
hard,
but
in
the
interest
of
administrative
convenience
follow
the
congressional
line?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
they
ask
congress
to
change
the
law?
justice
rehnquist
well
do
you
think
the
federal
statute
places
some
limit
on
what
a
state
court
might
do
under
your
theory
as
to
allowing
recovery
by
the
state
from
one
spouse
or
another?
justice
rehnquist
but
in
cases
like
weinberger
v.
salfi,
we've
said
that
the...
you
don't
have
to
have
an
individualized
determination
in
every
cases.
the
secretary
may
propound
a
general
regulation
that
is
adequate
for
most
cases.
there
may
be
some
hard
cases,
but
when
you
are
administering
a
complex
system
of
social
insurance,
you
are
not
required
to
have
an
individualized
hearing.
justice
rehnquist
but
here,
the
statute
says
available
as
prescribed
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
in
effect,
you
are
challenging
the
statute
to...
for
not
having
included
the
adjective
"actually".
