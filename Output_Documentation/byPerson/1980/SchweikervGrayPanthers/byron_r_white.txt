justice
white
could
i
ask,
that
new
regulations
have
been
issued
finally?
justice
white
and
if
you
win
this
case
what
happens
to
them?
justice
white
well
did
he
need
to
issue
the
regulations
under
the...
was
he
ordered
to
issue
them?
justice
white
did
he
ever
ask
for
a
stay?
justice
white
including
here,
i
suppose?
justice
white
well
he
says
if
i
win
this
case
i
may
revise
these
regulations.
justice
white
--well
when
would
it
ever
be
necessary
to...
i
suppose
if
the
secretary
loses
the
case,
but
on
a
ground
that's
different
from
the
court
of
appeals,
maybe
he
would
have
to
issue
some
different
regulations,
is
that
what
he
means?
justice
white
well
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
reversed,
outright,
and
say
the
secretary
is
told
that
you
were
right
the
first
time?
what
happens
then?
do
you
know?
does
the
secretary
say
what
he
would
do
then,
or
not?
