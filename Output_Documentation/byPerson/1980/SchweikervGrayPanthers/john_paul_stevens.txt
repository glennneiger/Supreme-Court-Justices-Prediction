justice
stevens
and
whether
or
not
he
does,
he's
asserting
the
right
to
do
so,
that's
what
you're
here
for,
why
you're
here?
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
while
you
are
on
the
legislative
history...
although
i
understand
you
are
directing
yourself
now
to
this
question
of
spouses,
what
about
the
house
report
that
is
quoted
on
page
42
of
your
opponent's
brief,
which
says
that
another
provision
that
is
included
that
requires
states
to
take
into
account
"only
such
income
and
resources
as
are
actually
available
to
the
applicant.
"
and
then
they
also
quote
a
comment
by
senator
ribicoff
that
says
the
bill
will
require
only
income
and
resources
actually
available
to
the
applicant
to
be
considered
in
the...
does
that,
what
is
your
comment
on
those--
justice
stevens
--but
can
the
secretary
pass
standards
that
include
the
deemed
income
to
be
available
when
it
is
not
actually
available?
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
stevens
would
you...
is
it
your
view
that
if
the
statute
included
the
words
"actually
available"
we'd
still
have
the
same
case?
justice
stevens
we've
just
inserted
the
word
"actually"
in
the
statute,
which
is
not
there,
but
the
word
"actually"
is
in
the
legislative
history.
would
that
make
any
difference
to
your
argument?
justice
stevens
mr.
jones,
could
i
ask
you
another
question?
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
basic
issue
here
would
have
been
the
same
if...
i
guess
the
regulations
has
been
the
same
ever
since
1965,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
but
on
this
particular
issue,
on
the
deeming
issue?
justice
stevens
and
some
states
have
done
that
since
the
beginning
evidently?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
this
issue
wasn't
litigated
somewhere
between
1965
and
1972?
justice
stevens
because
it
could
have
been,
couldn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
as
i
understand
it,
some
of
the
states
had,
although
hadn't
been
using
ssi
standards
because
there
was
no
ssi,
they
had
been
using
the
same
approach
to
the
joint
income.
justice
stevens
well
no,
i
know,
but
wasn't
the
effect
of
that
to
say
there
are
a
group
of
states
that
can
follow
the
same
rules
they
used
to
follow
from
'65
to
'72?
justice
stevens
it's
those
states
we're
now
concerned
with,
and
i
don't
understand
why
this
issue
didn't
arise
somewhere
along
the
line
a
lot
earlier?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
it's
not...
i'm
not,
no
reason
to
blame
you
for
it,
i'm
not...
don't
mean
that,
but
i
just
don't
understand
it,
why
it
takes
so
long
for
such
a...
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fairly
obvious
problem,
about
which--
justice
stevens
--reasonable
men
could
differ.
justice
stevens
well
unless
it
was
a
violation
of
law
in
1972?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well
may
i
ask
what--
--mr.
deford,
do
you...
excuse
me...
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
as
rejecting
your
basic
theory;
because
they
in
effect
held,
as
i
understand
it,
that
deeming
is
permitted
under
certain
circumstances.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
deford,
i
think
you
have
still
another
hurdle,
because
as
i
understood
your
opponent,
he
conceded
for
purposes
of
argument
that
even
if
the
word
"actually"
could
be
considered
to
be
a
part
of
the
statute,
and
it
wouldn't
change
his
basic
argument.
that
even
if
it
read
"actually
available",
still,
what
is
actually
available
must
be
defined
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
while
you
are
stopped,
what
is
your
view
of
the
sort
of
standards
he
should
write
under
clause
(b)?
if
he
can't
write
standards
that
say
when
income
shall
be
deemed
attributable
to
one
spouse
or
the
other,
what
kind
of
standards...
are
those...
is
that
just
a
procedural
concept
in
your
view?
justice
stevens
yes,
what
should...
what
kind
of
standards
should
he
be
writing
to
determine
what
income
is
available
if
he
isn't
adopting
some
rather
arbitrary
rules,
saying
well,
if
the
husband
makes
3x,
why
certain
percentages--
justice
stevens
--but
if
the
statute
means
what
you
say,
you
didn't
even
need
those
regulations,
it
would
have
been
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
my
question
though,
is
directed
at
what
do
you
think
congress
meant?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you
wouldn't
even
need
a
regulation
to
implement
(b)
if
it
means,
and
i
certainly
understand
your
very
persuasive
argument,
it
means
that
it's
got
to
be
actually
available.
but
i
don't
know
why
the
statute
wouldn't
take
care
of
it
and
why
do
you
need
a
regulation
that
says
yes,
we
mean
it's
got
to
be
actually
available.
justice
stevens
what
it
does,
mr.
deford,
on
the
very
example
you
give...
let
me
just
be
sure
what
your
view
is...
your
view
is
that
under
the
statute
the
husband
is
entitled
to
be
institutionalized,
but
the
state
could
nevertheless
bring
a
lawsuit
against
the
spouse
and--
justice
stevens
--get
an
order
requiring
her
to
turn
over
$80
a
month.
justice
stevens
it
may
end
up
in
the...
economically
in
the
same
harsh
position,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
stevens
but
is
the
deeming...
is
it
arbitrary
then
because
it
imposes
a
greater
financial
burden
on
the
spouse
than
state
law
would
impose,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
stevens
well,
i
was
under
a
misapprehension,
because
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
were
assuming
that
the
secretary
could
not
deny
the
medical
benefit
to
one
spouse
but
would
nevertheless
have
a
remedy
in
state
court
to
collect
the
$80
a
month.
but
you're
not,
you're
saying
there
is--
justice
stevens
--well,
let's
take
the
hard
cases,
let's
take
this
very
case.
is
it
your
view
that
the
secretary
not
only
must
accept
the
incapacitated
spouse,
but
may
not
recover
the
$80
from
the
other
spouse
in
a
subsequent
proceeding?
justice
stevens
mr.
deford,
would
you
comment
just
very
briefly
on
the
government's
second
argument
which,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
deeming
is
permitted
under
ssi
and
it's
not
realistic
to
assume
congress
intended
the
209(b)
option
to
prohibit
deeming
if
it
is
permitted
in
the
more
liberal
option.
justice
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
just
for
one
preliminary?
do
you
agree
that
deeming
is
permitted
in
the
ssi
situation?
