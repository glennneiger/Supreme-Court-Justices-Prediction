you
mean,
if
there's
a
reversal
there
will
have
to
be
a
revision?
justice
jr.
there
wouldn't
have
to
be,
would
there?
justice
jr.
well,
all
he
says,
and
this
is
in
that
footnote
on
page

it
may
be
necessary
to
revise
them.
justice
jr.
well,
if
there's
a
reversal,
i
suppose--
justice
jr.
--he
still
wouldn't
require...
having
a
reversal
wouldn't
require
him
to
do
anything.
justice
jr.
he
says
it
may
be
necessary,
whatever
that
is
supposed--
justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
what
is
the
significance
of
what
you
just
said
to
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
what's
it's
relevance?
justice
jr.
you
don't
suggest
the
case
isn't
a
live
case?
