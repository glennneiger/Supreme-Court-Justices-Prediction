mr.
george
w.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress'
use
of
the
term
"available
income"
in
the
medicaid
statute
was
intended
to
preclude
the
consideration
of
the
income
of
an
institutionalized
applicant's
spouse
for
the
purpose
of
making
medicaid
determinations.
respondent
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
challenging
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
on
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
the
regulations
required
all
participating
states
to
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
in
limited
circumstances,
but
also
permitted
some
states
to
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
more
broadly.
the
district
court
held
the
regulations
invalid
on
statutory
grounds,
and
therefore
did
not
consider
the
constitutional
arguments.
on
appeal,
the
d.c.
circuit
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
the
secretary
had
failed
to
consider
certain
factors
and
policy
concerns
that
the
court
thought
relevant.
one
judge
dissented.
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
court
on
remand,
the
secretary
has
now
published
new
regulations
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals.
while
it
is
difficult
to
determine
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
the
court
erred
in
invalidating
the
secretary's
regulations.
congress
expressly
authorized
the
secretary
to
define
the
term
"available
income"
for
purposes
of
the
medicaid
statute.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
regulations
may
be
modified.
in
the
preamble
to
the
regulations
the
secretary
pointed
out
that
the
regulations
were
based
solely
on
the
analysis
of
the
district,
the
d.c.
circuit,
and...
which
had,
in
effect,
rejected
the
secretary's
legal
analysis--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--yes.
in
fact,
the
district
court--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--several
times.
and
denied.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no
stay
was
asked
for
in
this
court.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
secretary
has
indicated
that
depending
on
the
nature
of
this
court's
disposition
of
this
case,
the
regulations
would
probably...
may
have
to
be
revised
and
of
course,
rescinded
first
and
then
revised.
mr.
george
w.
jones
yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
there
wouldn't
have
to
be,
but
since
the
secretary
was
in
effect
ordered
to
disregard
his
own
analysis
of
the
statutory
provisions,
and
instead,
published
regulations
based
upon
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
that...
if
the
analysis
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
held
to
be
wrong,
the
secretary
would
of
course
have
to
reconsider
the
regulations.
mr.
george
w.
jones
depending
on
the
nature
of
this
court's
disposition.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
but
the
secretary
was
in
effect
ordered--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well,
no.
he
says
if--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--the
supreme
court
grants--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no,
the
secretary
doesn't.
and
the
secretary
didn't
know
whether
the
court
was
going
to
grant--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--yes.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
sure.
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
statement
in
the
preamble
to
the
regulations.
mr.
george
w.
jones
excuse
me?
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
for
sure.
congress
has
expressly
authorized
the
secretary
to
define
the
term
"available
income"
for
purposes
of
the
medicaid
statute.
and
this
court's
decision
in
batterton
v.
francis
makes
it
plain
that
an
agency's
exercise
of
such
express
statutory
authority
may
only
be
set
aside
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
on
which
it
is
based,
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
otherwise
unlawful.
disagreement
with
the
judgment
necessarily
implicit
in
such
an
exercise
of
authority
is
insufficient.
the
court
of
appeals
first
agreed
with
the
secretary
that
the
congress'
use
of
the
term
"available
income"
was
not
intended
to
preclude
consideration
of
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse.
although
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
that
distinguishes
between
spouses
who
are
living
together
and
those
who
are
separated
by
institutionalization,
the
court
of
appeals
inferred
from
the
legislative
history,
a
congressional
intention
to
create
such
a
distinction.
the
basis
for
this
inference
was
a
statement
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
the
states
would
be
precluded
from
assuming
the
availability
of
the
income
of
an
absent
father,
or
on
the
basis
of
a
court
support
order.
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
this
statement
suggested
a
general
intention
to
treat
spouses
living
together
different
from
those
who
are
separated
by
institutionalization.
the
statement
provides
only
the
most
tenuous
support
for
the
court's
inference,
and
it
is
plainly
insufficient
to
support
invalidation
of
the
secretary's
regulations.
as
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged,
congress
has
stated
that
it
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
secretary
and
not
the
courts,
to
determine
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
income
of
the
medicaid
applicant's
spouse
will
be
considered
for
the
purposes
of
determining
medicaid
eligibility
and
the
amount
of
assistance.
without
substantially
more
support
than
that
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
the
secretary's
exercise
of
that
responsibility
should
be
upheld.
the
secretary
has
consistently
interpreted
the
term
"available
income"
to
include
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
whether
they
live
together
or
not.
both
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
or
the
statute
support
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
in
the
provision
of
the
medicaid
act
dealing
exclusively
with
state
eligibility
criteria,
congress
provided
that
only
available
income
should
be
considered.
in
this
same
provision,
congress
also
stated
that
the
states
could
consider
the
financial
responsibility
of
the
applicant's
spouse
for
the
purpose
of
making
medicaid
determinations
and
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
amount
of
assistance
an
applicant
might
be
entitled
to.
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
expressly
stated
its
view
that
spouses
should
be
expected
to
support
each
other.
congress
did
not
distinguish
between
spouses
living
together
and
those
who
are
separated
by
institutionalization,
or
for
some
other
reason,
nor
was
the
secretary
required
to
do
so.
respondent
contends
that
the
states
may
only
consider
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
by
filing
an
independent
lawsuit
under
generally
applicable
civil
or
criminal
support
statutes.
this
court
should
reject
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
the
states
may
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
for
the
purpose
of
determining
medicaid
eligibility
and
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
amount
of
assistance
an
applicant
may
be
entitled
to.
this
is
an
initial
step.
respondent
has
never
attempted...
or,
never
explained
how
filing
an
independent
lawsuit
under
a
generally
applicable
civil
or
criminal
statute
can
be
said
to
be
considering
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
for
the
purpose
of
making
medicaid
determinations.
second,
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
require
the
filing
of
thousands
of
tiny
lawsuits,
sometimes
perhaps
several
against
the
same
individual,
since
the
payments
are
made
by
the
state
monthly
or
quarterly
and
the
spouse...
and,
at
the
same
time
the
state
would
be
continuing
to
pay
benefits
to
an
individual
who
may
or
may
not
be
eligible
for
benefits.
and
finally,
if
congress
intended
to
create
such
a
distinction
or
such
an
administrative
scheme
which
would
have
required
the
states
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
filing
all
of
these
lawsuits,
trying
to
recover
money
that
they
shouldn't
have
had
to
pay
out
in
the
first
place,
one
would
expect
that
something
in
the
legislative
history
would
have
been
said
about
this.
there
is
absolutely
no
support
in
the
legislative
history
suggesting
that
congress
intended
for
the
states
to
consider
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
for
the
purpose
of
determining
medicaid
eligibility
by
filing
an
independent
lawsuit.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
the
omission
from
the
quotation
here
is
that
the
states
were
to
take
into
account
income
that
was...
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary,
actually
available
to
the
applicant.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well,
to
put
the
question
that
way
is
almost
to
assume
the
answer,
because
the
available,
for
purposes
of
the
medicaid
statute,
is
determined
by
the
secretary
and
income
that
the
applicant's
spouse
actually
receives
is
actually
available.
the
secretary
and
congress,
have
always
interpreted
the
term
"available
income"
for
purposes
of
the
medicaid
statute
to
include
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse.
mr.
george
w.
jones
if
the
statute
also
said
"actually
available"
as
determined
in
accordance
with--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--i
think
not.
respondent
also
contends
that
the
word
"available"--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--yes.
the
language
of
the
two
provisions,
in
batterton
v.
francis...
the
secretary
was
authorized
to
prescribe
standards
for
determining
unemployment,
for
defining
the
term
"unemployment".
in
this
case,
in
almost
identical
language,
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
prescribe
the
standards
for
determining
what
is
"available
income".
mr.
george
w.
jones
but
the
majority
opinion
is
controlling
here.
the
respondent
contends
that
the
term
"available
income"
includes
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
only
if
it
is
actually
contributed
in
some
sense.
congress
however,
used
the
term
"available
income"
and
not
contributed.
furthermore,
congress
expressly
authorized
the
states
to
consider
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse.
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
might
be
said
that
congress
clearly
did
not
intend
the
term
"available"
to
be
interpreted
to
exclude
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
since
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
further
provision
that
the
states
could
consider
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
that
was
prohibited
in
the
preceding
section.
in
addition
to
authorizing
the
states
to
consider
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse,
congress
delegated
responsibility
to
the
secretary
for
giving
further
content
to
that
term.
the
secretary
has
never
construed
the
term
to
exclude
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
simply
because
the
spouse
refused
to
turn
it
over
to
the
applicant;
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
even
suggests
that
interpretation
of
the
language
and
there's
certainly
nothing
that
requires
the
secretary
to
adopt
that
construction.
absent
compelling
evidence
that
the
secretary
has
grossly
misconceived
congress'
intent,
this
court
should
decline
respondent's
invitation
to
disregard
the
interpretation
of
the
agency
congress
has
expressly
authorized
to
define
the
statutory
term.
the
last
part
of
our
brief
is
devoted
to
explaining
the
analysis
that
led
to
the
particular
regulations
in
this
case.
and
we
recognized,
as
respondents
point
out,
the
complexity
of
that
analysis.
and
i
would
like
to
try
briefly
to
explain
what
the
analysis
was
that
led
to
the
regulations.
following
the
enactment
of
the
supplemental
security
income
program
for
the
aged,
blind
and
disabled
in
1972,
the
secretary
published
regulations
reflecting
the
impact
of
this
new
legislation.
all
participating
states
were
required
to
consider
the
income
of
a
medicaid
applicant's
spouse
to
the
extent
that
it
would
be
considered
in
determining
ssi
eligibility.
the
states
that
exercised
the
209(b)
option
were
permitted
to
consider
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse
to
the
extent
that
they
did
so
in
1972
even
if
it
would
not
be
considered
in
determining
ssi
eligibility.
and
thus,
the
secretary's
regulations
established
a
kind
of
maximum
and
minimum
extent
to
which
states
may
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
for
purposes
of
determining
medicaid.
the
secretary's
regulations
are
based
on
the
very
careful
analysis
of
two
exceedingly
complex
social
welfare
statutes.
they
are
not
based
on
the
notion
that
congress'
reasons
for
adopting
the
particular
ssi
provisions
are
directly
applicable
in
the
medicaid
context,
nor
did
the
secretary
assume
that
congress
intended
in
some
sense
to
prescribe
rules
for
determining
what
income
is
available
for
purposes
of
the
medicaid
program.
rather,
as
i
said,
the
regulations
are
derived
from
an
analysis
of
the
interlocking
provisions
of
the
medicaid
and
ssi
statutes.
these
regulations
cannot
reasonably
be
characterized
as
arbitrary
or
capricious.
section
1902(a)(10)
of
the
medicaid
statute
establishes
the
basic
scope
of
the
medicaid
program.
more
important
for
present
purposes,
that
provision
establishes
or
provides
the
key
to
understanding
the
analysis
that
led
to
the
regulations
challenged
here.
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
statutes
the
secretary
requires
the
states
to
consider
the
income
to
the
extent
that
it
would
be
considered
in
determining
ssi
eligibility.
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
209(b)
option,
the
secretary
permits
the
states
to
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
to
the
extent
they
did
so
in
1972.
under
the
first
provision
of
section
1902(a)(10),
all
states,
all
participating
states,
are
required
to
provide
medicaid
benefits
to
every
aged,
blind,
disabled
individual
receiving
benefits
under
the
ssi
program.
now
putting
to
one
side
for
the
moment
the
209(b)
option,
it
is
clear
that
the
secretary
could
not
permit
any
state
to
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
if
it
would
not
be
considered
in
determining
ssi
eligibility.
otherwise,
individuals
who
were
receiving
ssi
benefits
could
be
found
ineligible
for
medicaid
contrary
to
the
very
clear
command
of
section
1902(a)(10)(a)
that
all
ssi
recipients
be
covered.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
aged,
blind
or
disabled
individuals
who
are
ineligible
for
ssi
benefits
are
also
ineligible
for
medicaid,
unless
the
state...
unless
they
meet
the
requirements
of
one
of
the
very
carefully
circumscribed
optional
group
provisions
and
the
state
has
decided
to
provide
medicaid
benefits
to
that
particular
group.
now
again
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
209(b)
option,
it
follows
that
the
secretary
cannot...
it
follows
that
the
states
must
consider
the
income
of
all
applicants
and
their
spouses
to
the
extent
that
it
would
be
considered
under
the
ssi
statute.
otherwise,
even
if
an
individual
is
ineligible
for
ssi
benefits
he
could
be
found
eligible
for
medicaid,
even
if
the
state
doesn't
provide
benefits
to
any
of
the
optional
coverage
groups;
a
result
that
is
manifestly
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
secretary
obviously
cannot
redetermine
the
eligibility
of
every
person
covered
every
state
plan.
there
are
certain
optional
coverage
provisions
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
describe
them
in
detail
here...
it
should
be
emphasized
however,
that
each
of
them
is
subject
to
its
own
set
of
very
carefully
drawn
limitations.
because
of
the
inequity
of
permitting
the
states
to
use
one
method
for
determining
the,
for
calculating
the
income
of
the
optional
coverage
groups,
and
another
method
for
calculating
the
income
of
the
mandatory
coverage
groups,
the
secretary
has
required
the
states
to
use
the
same
method
for
calculating
the
income
of
both.
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
respondent
challenges
that
aspect
of
the
secretary's
regulations.
thus,
unless
the
209(b)
option
requires
a
different
kind
of
analysis,
the
relationship
between
the
medicaid
and
ssi
statutes
not
only
supports
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
regulations
but
virtually
compels
those
regulations.
the
language,
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
209(b)
option
all
support
the
secretary's
conclusion
that
the
provision
does
not
require
a
different
analysis.
by
its
terms,
the
provision
simply
gives
the
states
an
option
to
deny
medicaid
coverage
to
those
individuals
the
states
would
otherwise
be
required
to
cover.
as
i
pointed
out
however,
the
only
individuals
the
state
is
required
to
cover
are
ssi
recipients,
under
section
1902(a)(10)(a).
the
primary
effect
of
the
209(b)
option
then
is
simply
to
give
the
states
a
partial
exemption
from
the
otherwise
applicable
requirements
of
that
provision.
the
legislative
history
makes
virtually
indisputable
what
seems
apparent
from
the
terms
of
the
provision.
in
explaining
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
provision,
both
the
senate
committee
and
the
house
committee
pointed
out
that
the
provision
was
simply
intended
to
allow
the
states
to
exclude
from
mandatory
medicaid
coverage
there
individuals
it
would
not
have
been
required
to
cover
before
the
ssi
program
was
adopted.
the
states
were
to
be
permitted
to
exclude
from
coverage
those
individuals
who
were
newly
eligible,
that
is,
those
who
became
eligible
for
mandatory
medicaid
coverage
because
the
scope
of
coverage
under
the
ssi
statute
was
broader
than
that
of
the
old
categorical
assistance
programs
that
it
replaced.
with
one
arguable
exception,
209(b)
states
like
ssi
states
are
only
entitled
to
federal
financial
assistance
for
providing
medicaid
benefits
to
an
individual
who
is
ineligible
for
ssi
if
the
state
provides
benefits
pursuant
to
one
of
the
optional
provisions.
thus,
all
states
must
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
would
be
considered
in
determining
ssi
eligibility.
otherwise,
the
secretary
would
be
obliged
to
redetermine
the
eligibility
of
every
person
covered
under
every
state
plan
in
order...
or
before
he
could
determine
whether
the
state
federal
financial
assistance,
an
impossible
administrative
burden
and
surely
not
one
congress
intended
to
impose.
mr.
george
w.
jones
no.
they've
gone
through
a
series
of--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--the
regulations
have
always
permitted
the
states
to
include
or
consider
the
income
of
an
applicant's
spouse,
whether
they
live
together
or
not.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--it
could
have
been.
there
were
several,
a
number
of
district
court
decisions
which
aren't
very
carefully
analyzed,
but
the...
the
problem
apparently,
was
that
when
the
secretary
published
these
new
regulations
the
provision
was
explicitly
put
in
that
the
states
would
be
obliged
to
use
the
ssi
standards,
and
that
brought
home
to
everybody,
i
presume--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--right.
and
in
fact,
the
secretary,
in
the
preamble
to
the
regulations,
indicates
that
in
large
part,
or
most
of
the
states,
the
ssi
states,
would
be
limited
in
the
extent
that
they
would
be
considering
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouse.
so
it
was
a
benefit
for
medicaid
applicants
in
all
of
those
ssi
states.
congress'
purpose
in--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--right.
because
the
209(b)
option
wasn't
adopted
until
1972.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
george
w.
jones
well--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--well
i
think--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--as
justice...
as
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
the
real
problem
here
and
the
thing
that
has
caused
the
commotion,
i
guess,
is
that
congress
has
allowed
the
209(b)
states
to
use
the
1972
levels,
and
over
the
course
of
the
years,
since
1972,
inflation
has
increased
substantially.
and
although
all
of
the
states,
all
the
209(b)
states
i
think
have
raised
the
level
somewhat
since
1972,
they
are
still
lower
in
many
cases
than
the
ssi
standards.
and
i
think
it's
the
inflation
factor
that
has
generated
the
controversy
surrounding
the
regulations
now.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
purpose
of
the
209(b)
option
was
to
permit
the
states
to
consider
the
income...
or
to
exclude
from
medicaid
coverage,
all
of
those
individuals
who
wouldn't
have
been
eligible
in
1972,
and
if
the
states
were
validly
considering
the
income
of
the
applicant's
spouses
in
1972,
the
secretary
has
no
power
to
require
them
to
ignore
that
income
today
and
provide
medicaid
coverage
even
if
the
individual
is
receiving
ssi
benefits.
mr.
george
w.
jones
that's
right,
if
they
were
validly
considering--
mr.
george
w.
jones
--the
income.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
w.
jones
the
first
point
that
i
want
to
make
in
my
three
minutes
is
that
respondent's
emphasis,
one,
the
levels
with
the
hypotheticals
of
mrs.
ford
or
mr.
ford,
i
guess,
is
inappropriate
in
this
case
because
the
level
of
benefits
or
the
levels...
or
the
amount
of
the
contribution
the
state
requires
the
spouse
to
make
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
secretary's
regulations
were
invalid
for
failure
to
distinguish
between
spouses
living
together
and
those
who
were
separated
by
institutionalization.
the
level,
the
amount
of
the
contribution
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
secretary's
regulations
did
not
prescribe
the
amount
of
the
contribution,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
invalidate
the
regulations
because
of
the
amount
of
the
contribution
asked.
now,
in
response,
my
own
hypothetical
might
be
useful.
respondent's
position
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
money
the
spouse
has,
as
long
as
he
refuses
to
contribute
it.
now,
if
a
spouse
has
$100,000
of
income,
mr.
deford
says
most
of
these
people
don't
have
$100,000
of
income.
but
as
he
pointed
out,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
he
did,
as
long
as
he
refuses
to
contribute
it,
the
applicant
is
eligible
for
medicaid
and
the
state
is
obliged
to
pay
out
benefits
while,
or
in
the
interim,
while
it
tries
to
collect
this
money
from
the
spouse
who
may
or
may
not
have
money
available
for
the
state
to
attach,
assuming
of
course,
that
the
state
has
such
a
statute
under
which
it
could
pursue
the
spouse.
we
are
informed
that
there
are
some
states
who
don't.
now,
it's
conceivable
that
the
states
could
adopt
a
statute
that
would
allow
them
to
do
this,
but
it's
not
clear
that
all
states
do
have
those
programs,
those
statutes.
the
final
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
respondent
has
suggested
that
the
209(b)
option
doesn't
do
what
we
say
it
does.
i'd
like
to
just
read
briefly
from
the
senate
report
describing
that
option.
"the
209(b)
option
gives
states
the
option
of
covering
under
medicaid,
aged,
blind
and
disabled
persons
made
newly
eligible
for
cash
assistance
as
a
result
of
the
increases
in
payment
levels
to
these
persons
provided
under
the
bill,
the
ssi
statute.
"
"no
state
would
be
required
to
furnish
medical
assistance
to
any
individual
receiving
aid
as
a
needy
aged,
blind
or
disabled
adult,
unless
the
state
would
be
required
or
would
have
been
required
under
its
1972
plan.
"
there's
no
other
way
to
read
that
language.
my
time
is
up.
