stewart
will
these
new
regulations
be
rescinded
if
you
prevail
in
this
litigation?
justice
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
amicus
brief--
justice
stewart
--there's
more
than
one?
justice
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
one
filed
by
john
h.
ford,
lana
carter
and
others?
justice
stewart
well,
you
differ
with
government
counsel
as
to--
justice
stewart
--what
the
statute
says,
don't
you?
justice
stewart
well
it
also
says
that
an
option
state
can
go
back
to
the
regime
that
it
administered
from
1965
to
1972,
if
the
dates
are
right.
justice
stewart
yes,
in
'72,
so
long
as
it
was
lawful.
but
that,
it
need
not
give
medicaid
to
anybody
who
is
not
eligible
under
ssi,
that
is,
i
think
that's
the
government's
position.
justice
stewart
and
you
disagree?
and
you
disagree
as
to
what
the
statute
provides.
