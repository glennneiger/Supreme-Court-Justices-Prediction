we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
schweiker,
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
v.
gray
panthers.
mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
did
he
make
these
new
regulations
under
the
coercive
impact
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision?
chief
justice
burger
so
the
odds
are
that
he
will
re
examine
them
at
the
very
least,
and
see
whether
he
wants
to
stay
with
them
if
you
prevail
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
deford.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
not
generally
true
that
under
state
law,
take
a
hypothetical
case,
a
man
and
wife
are
separated
but
not
divorced,
and
the
wife
is
affluent,
has
millions,
and
the
husband
falls
on
evil
times
and
can't
take
care
of
himself,
under
state
law
in
most
states
cannot
the
one
spouse
be
required
to--
chief
justice
burger
--no
question
about
it,
is
there?
chief
justice
burger
my
hypothetical
was
wealthy,
even
if
not
wealthy,
whatever
the
other
spouse
has
must
be
employed
to--
chief
justice
burger
--i
see.
so
that
they
can
maintain
their
own
support.
chief
justice
burger
but
if
there's
enough
for
both
it
must
be
shared,
is
it?
chief
justice
burger
non-institutional,
i
guess,
why
do
you
make
the
difference
between
institutionalized
and
non
institutionalized?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
they
are
separated
first
and
then
after
the
separation
one
of
them
becomes
institutionalized
and
the
other
one
has
resources,
those
resources
may
be
reached?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
referring
to
the
use
of
the
term
"actually
available"?
chief
justice
burger
but
isn't
that
a
term
that
could
have
so
readily
been
put
into
the
statute
that
if
congress
intended
that
they
would
have
said
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
burger
where
did
they
say
that?
chief
justice
burger
legislative
history,
not
in
the
statute?
not
in
the
legislation.
chief
justice
burger
you
are
challenging...
you
are
in
effect
challenging
the
statute
here?
chief
justice
burger
then
you
don't
distinguish
between
whether
it
is
$500
a
month
or
$5000
a
month,
that
the
spouse
has,
apparently?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jones,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
