mr.
gill
de
ford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
begin,
i
would
like
to
clarify
two
points
which
were
raised
in
the
questioning
of
mr.
jones.
first,
i'd
like
to
note
that
the
preamble
to
the
regulations
which
were
finally
promulgated
in
december,
1980,
pursuant
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
has
been
misinterpreted.
they
did
not
require
that
the
secretary
only
consider
the
policy
factors
outlined
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision.
i'd
like
to
read
briefly
from
the
end
of
the
court
of
appeals'
majority
decision,
to
make
that
point.
this
appears
on
page
12(a)
of
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari:
"in
issuing
regulations
implementing
the
209(b)
option,
the
secretary
is
required
to
consider
those
policy
concerns
outlined
in
part
above,
which
congress
intended
would
guide
for
discretion
in
determining
under
what
circumstances
and
to
what
extent
deeming
would
be
permitted.
"
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
was
to
outline
two
factors,
at
least,
which
the
secretary
should
take
into
account
in
promulgating
new
regulations.
but
the
secretary's
regulations,
as
the
preamble
indicates,
took
into
account
several
other
factors.
and
so
it
is
not
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
told
the
secretary
what
she
had
to
do.
all
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
say,
go
back,
look
at
this
issue
again,
take
into
account
policy
factors
which
you've
never
considered
before
and
then
promulgate
new
regulations
in
light
of
those
policy
considerations.
mr.
gill
de
ford
the
court
of
appeals
did
affirm
the
district
court's
invalidation
of
those
regulations,
that's
true.
mr.
gill
de
ford
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
gill
de
ford
well,
your
honor,
i
assume
you
refer
to
the
batterton
standard
which
is
quoted...
which
quotes
the
apa--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--i
would
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
been
acting
under
that
aspect
of
the
act.
mr.
gill
de
ford
well,
assuming
since
they
referred
throughout
the
decision,
both
to
batterton
and
to
overton
park,
citizens
for
overton
park,
i
assume
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
using
the
apa
standard
in
making
its
determination.
mr.
gill
de
ford
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was,
in
certain
circumstances
deeming
was
not
permitted
and
in
certain
circumstances
it
was
permitted,
specifically
where
the
spouses
were
still
living
together,
but
in
certain
circumstances
especially
where
they
were
separated,
and
especially
where
they
were
separated
under
certain
conditions,
deeming
was
not
permitted.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
tell
the
secretary
what
regulations,
at
that
time,
she
had
to
come
up
with.
it
only
outlined
those
factors
and
said
deeming
is
a
different
ballgame
when
the
spouses
are
separated,
and
it
should
not
be
permitted
at
that
time.
mr.
gill
de
ford
well
the
issue
was
raised
before
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
told
the
secretary
what
exactly--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--your
honor,
i
simply
wanted
to
clarify
what
i
consider
a
point
which
was
made--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--no,
i
certainly
don't,
your
honor.
one
other
point
which
was
raised
at
the
end
of
the
other
discussion
was
the
reason
why
this
issue
was
not
raised
until
1974,
i
believe,
was
the
first
case.
we
speculate
that
the
major
reason
was
not
just
inflation,
but
the
inflationary
cost
of
nursing
home
care.
and
since
that
has
gone
up
dramatically
in
the
last
six
or
seven
years,
it
has
cost
the
nursing
homes
much
more
to
take
care
of
people
and
therefore,
there's
a
much
greater
need
for
the
government
at
least...
there's
been
much
more
expenses
for
the
government,
both
state
and
federal;
and
therefore,
there's
been
a
greater
need
to
attempt
to
deem
income
from
a
non
institutionalized
spouse.
mr.
gill
de
ford
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
i
consider--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--no
question
that
this...
i
think
virtually
every
state
has
spousal
responsibility
laws,
which
allow
the
state
to
force
the
contribution,
an
appropriate
contribution
from
the
wealthy
spouse,
if
that's
what
it
is,
and
to
go
into
state
courts
and
demand
that
contribution
be
provided;
the
same
way
a
state
can
obtain
a
contribution
from
an
absent
father.
mr.
gill
de
ford
not
whatever,
the
other
spouse
has
to
have
sufficient
income--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--exactly.
so
that
they
may
maintain
their
own
support.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that's
correct.
we
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
non
institutionalized
spouses
have
an
obligation
under
state
law
to
support
the
individual
in
the
institution.
the
only
issue--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--for
purposes
of
support.
because
when
spouses
are
living
together
as
a
general
practice,
one
spouse
is
going
to
almost
automatically
have
to
take
care
of
the
other
spouse.
the
payment
for
a
mortgage
or
for
rent,
the
payment
for
food,
the
payment
for
utility
costs,
will
automatically
be
available
to
the
other
spouse.
mr.
gill
de
ford
through
the
state's
judicial
processes,
that's
correct.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
that...
that
the
regulations
are
inconsistent
with
that
statute,
as
is
fleshed
out
by
the
legislative
history.
i'd
like
to
reiterate
what
the
issue
is
of
this
case,
because
i
believe
it
was
misstated
by
the
government.
the
issue
here
is
whether
congress
intended
that
an
arbitrary
portion
of
a
non
institutionalized
spouse's
income
can
be
conclusively
presumed
available
to
the
institutionalized
spouse
who
is
applying
for
medicaid
without
regard
to
whether
in
fact
that
income
is
available.
without
the
requirement
that
the
income
be
actually
available,
be
in
the
hands
of
the
institutionalized
spouse,
before
it
is
considered
by
the
state,
the
spouses
are
placed
in
an
impossible
dilemma.
their
choice
is
between
the
denial
of
necessary
health
care
to
the
individual
in
the
institution
and
a
sub
poverty
standard
of
living
for
the
other.
mr.
gill
de
ford
shall
define
what
is
available.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that's
correct,
your
honor;
that
is
right
in
the
statute,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
but
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
that
congress
did
not
leave
us
with
the
word
"available"
in
the
statute.
it
provided
a
rather
extensive
background
for
that
in
the
legislative
history
which
goes
into
considerably
greater
detail.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that's
one
instance,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
think
congress'
thinking
was
that
available
meant
"actually
available".
mr.
gill
de
ford
well,
because
of
other
instances
in
the
legislative
history.
for
instance,
congress
also
says
that
the
income
must
be
in
fact
available,
that
also
appeared
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
gill
de
ford
in
the
same
portion
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
gill
de
ford
not
in
the
legislation
itself,
that's
correct.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
think
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
itself,
has
in
some
senses
recognized
what
i
believe
most
people
would
believe
actually
available
and
income
in
fact
mean,
which
is
income
actually
in
the
hands
of,
in
the
control
of,
the
institutionalized
spouse.
in
the
guidelines
and
regulations
which
preceded
the
regulations
which
were
challenged
in
this
case,
the
secretary
himself
used
the
expression
actually
available
from
1966
through
1977,
in
the
medical...
in
supplement
(b)
to
the
handbook
of
medical
assistance,
the
secretary
said
that
only
income
in
hand
or
under
the
control
of
the
institutionalized
spouse
could
be
taken
into
consideration.
i
think
hhs
in
some
sense,
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
understood
what
congress
had
in
mind.
moreover,
i
think
when
congress
expects
that
there
will
be
deeming,
that
it
can
differentiate
that.
for
instance
in
the
ssi
statute,
there's
an
indication
that
it
understands
that
deeming
is
the
contrary
to
available
income.
i
believe
it's
42
u.s.c.
section
1382c(f)(1),
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
points
out
that
although
the
income...
that
income
between
spouses
in
certain
situations
should
be
deemed
even
if
it
is
not
available
to
the
other
spouse.
so
i
think
congress
sees
available
to
mean
what
i
assume
most
people
would
assume
it
to
mean,
which
is
that
spouse
who
is
going
to
have
medicaid
eligibility
determined,
must
have
that
income
in
hand
or
available
to
her.
and
if
the
income
is
still
in
the
hands
of
the
other
spouse,
and
for
whatever
reason,
either
because
that
spouse
does
not
want
to
contribute
or
feels
that
he
or
she
simply
cannot
contribute,
that
income
will
not
be
in
the
hands
of
the
individual
in
the
institution.
she
will
not
have
access
to
it,
in
order
to
afford
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
care.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--until
that
will...
is
probated,
the
income
is
not
available
or
is
certainly
not
in
hand
of
the
individual
who
might
have
access
to
it
at
some
point
later
in
the
future.
mr.
gill
de
ford
there's
a
difference,
but
i
think
the
secretary--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--well
i
think
the
secretary
has
understood
that
in
this
context,
given
the
legislative
history,
congress
intended
that
available
meant
in
hand,
because
it
was
the
secretary
who
repeatedly
interpreted
the
word
"available"
to
mean
in
hand
or
under
the
control
of
the
applicant
spouse.
mr.
gill
de
ford
as
to
what
the
regulation
should
look
like?
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
think
the
secretary
has,
in
fact,
promulgated
those
regulations.
that
was
done
back
in
november
of
1979,
after
the
district-court
decision,
before
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
those
regulations
were
never
finally...
were
never
published
in
final
form.
they
were
promulgated.
those
regulations
said
that
only
income
which
is
actually
being
contributed
to
the
institutionalized
spouse
can
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
gill
de
ford
well
i
must
say
that
the
words
"actually
available"
in
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
when
i
first
read
them,
suggested
to
me
that
the
secretary
was
not,
himself,
following
his
own
regulations.
if
"actually
available"
and
"income
in
hand"
and
"income
under
the
control
of",
does
not
mean
income
which
the
institutionalized
spouse,
him
or
herself
actually
has.
i
really
do
not
know
what
it
meant.
in
fact,
it's
our
position
that
hew
and
hss
have
been
inconsistent
in
dealing
with
this
statute.
for
11
years,
the
regulations--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--i
can't
think
of
an
example
off
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor,
but
i
suppose
there
would
be
instances
in
which
income
might
ultimately
be
considered
available
to
someone
and
should
be
considered
available,
which
that
individual
does
not
have.
maybe
the
example
is
as...
that
justice
marshall
suggested,
of
money
that
ultimately
will
be
probated...
maybe
in
some
circumstances
that
might
be
considered
available.
i
don't
think
it
should,
but
i
think
there
could
be
instances
in
which
available
might
be
stretched
somewhat.
i
don't
think
this
is
one
of
those
instances
and
i
think
congress
made
that
clear
in
the
legislative
history.
i
think
we've
been
discussing
this
morning
a
rather
dry
situation,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
bring
it
into
some
human
terms.
in
the
record
below
we
did
introduce
affidavits
indicating
how
deeming
actually
operates
with
flesh
and
blood
people.
i'd
like
to
briefly
illustrate,
by
going
through
the
fact
situation
of
one
of
the
individuals
described
in
the
amicus
brief,
how
deeming
does
in
fact
operate.
in
that
particular
case,
which
i
said
is
discussed
in
greater
detail,
as
are
other
cases,
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
husband
was
extremely
sick,
had
organic
brain
syndrome,
and
the
wife
was
attempting
to
care
for
him
at
home
and
did
so
for
about
8
or
9
months.
finally
because
of
his
illness--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--i'm
talking
about--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that's
correct.
that's
the
one.
the
wife
was
finally,
after
8
or
9
months,
unable
to
care
for
her
husband
at
home
and
was
forced
to
put
him
into
a
nursing
home.
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
deeming
regulations
took
hold.
the
wife's
total
income
was
only
$241
per
month
in
social
security
disability
benefits.
as
the
record
in
that
case
reflected,
this
was
just
barely
enough
for
her
to
get
by,
at
a
subsistent
standard
of
living.
the
state
of
north
carolina
determined
that
she
should
be
allowed
to
keep
only
$162
per
month
and
about
1/3
of
her
total
income
was
then
to
be
deemed
available
to
the
individual
in
the
institution.
it
then
became
impossible
for
her
to
get
by,
and
she
was
faced
with
what
we
think
in
the
common
and
regular
dilemma
faced
by
individuals
in
which
deeming...
against
whom
deeming
is
applied.
the
wife
had
the
choice
of
paying
the
deemed
amount
and
then
herself
living
without
sufficient
food,
shelter,
utility,
or
of
not
paying
the
deemed
amount
and
having
her
husband
evicted
from
the
nursing
home,
which
is
the
ultimate
effect
of
that
non
payment
of
the
deemed
amount.
mr.
gill
de
ford
claiming,
your
honor,
that
in
order
for
the
state
to
demand
a
payment
from
the
spouse
outside
of
an
institution,
if
that
spouse
refuses
to
cooperate
voluntarily,
that
the
state
would
have
to
use
its
relative
responsibility
laws
which
the
medicaid
statute
specifically
allows
it
to
do
in
clause
(d)
of
subsection
17,
and
go
into
court,
and
at
that
point
a
determination
would
be
made
as
to
what
a
reasonable
contribution
should
be.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
think
as
a
general
rule,
the
secretary
obviously
has
a
right
to
promulgate
fairly
general
regulations.
but
this
is
not
an
isolated
instance.
this
is
happening
regularly
throughout
the
country
to
a
large
number
of
people.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
think
the
law
as
it
is
now
set
up
takes
into
account
this
situation.
congress
itself--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
don't
think--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--i
don't
think
the
state
would
be
able
to
go
into
a
state
court
of
law
and
get
a
judge
to
order
a
woman
whose
income
is
only
$240
a
month
to
pay
a
third
of
that
income
to
the
institution,
if
that's
going
to
force
her
to
live
in
a
sub
poverty
standard
at
living.
i
think
that's
the
key
print,
that
deeming
is
an
arbitrary
system--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--it's
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
it
is
administratively
convenient
to
the
state,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
but
that
administrative
convenience
is
far
outweighed
by
the
terrible
burden
it
places
on
both
spouses.
and
that
was
the
burden
that
congress
sought
to
avoid.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i'm
saying
that
in
many
instances,
the
non
institutionalized
spouse
would
have
sufficient
income--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--i'm
saying
that
the
state
could
go
into
court
and
might
be
able
to
get
some
money
out
of
her.
but
i
doubt
that
a
state
court
would
order
someone
to
pay
one
third
of
their
income,
in
that
instance.
whereas
deeming
automatically
allows
the
state
to
do
that,
without
going
to
any
of
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
non
institutionalized
spouse
might
have.
i
think
in
a
state
court
the
judge
would
evaluate
what
the
necessary
expenses
of
that
person
were,
have
them
prove
what
they
needed
to
get
by,
some
sort
of
basic
standard
of
existence.
but
i
don't...
i
think
the
more
common
example
would
be
someone
who
perhaps
had
$400
a
month
income.
now
the
state...
under
deeming,
that
person
would
be
forced
to
give
up,
in
this
state,
$240
a
month,
down
to
$160.
i
think
the
state
court
might
order
that
person
to
pay
$50
or
$60
or
$80
or
$100.
but
i
don't
think
they
would
force
them
into
poverty
as
the
price
for
obtaining
necessary
health
care
for
the
other
individual.
mr.
gill
de
ford
no,
the
federal
statute
simply
gives
the
state
the
right
to
use
its
responsibility
laws
for
spouses.
it
takes
that
right
away
for
virtually
every
other
relative
except
parents,
in
clause
(d).
but
the
federal
government
does
not
impose
on
the
state
how
much
it
might
ultimately
recover
from
that
individual
through
the
regular
judicial
process.
our
argument
here
is
that
deeming
is
an
entirely
arbitrary
process,
which
precludes
the
individual
from
showing,
the
non
institutionalized
spouse
from
showing
what
his
or
her
necessary
basic
expenses
are.
the
normal
judicial
process
would
allow
that
individual
to
make
a
proof
as
to
what
income
that
individual
needs
to
get
by.
mr.
gill
de
ford
well
first,
your
honor,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
salfi
was
a
statutory
case;
i
think
there
was
a
statute
which
was
challenged,
not
a
regulation.
we
say
that
the
statute
here
requires
that
available
income
only
be
taken
into
consideration.
i
believe
in
salfi
it
was
a
statute
which
was
challenged
on
constitutional
grounds,
and
this
court--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
not
only
implicit,
but
explicit
in
everything
congress
has
said
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
case,
both
by
individuals--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--no,
your
honor.
we're
simply
saying
that
the
word
"available"
in
the
statute
must
be
interpreted
in
at
least
this
context,
to
mean
only
income
which
is
actually
there.
when
the
spouses
are
separated,
when
the
spouses
are
no
longer
living
together,
the
logical
basis
for
deeming
which
is
couples,
spouses
contributing
to
each
other,
no
longer
exists...
they
are
living
at
different
places
and
one
of
them
is
living
in
an
institution.
it's
simply
illogical
and
irrational
to
pretend
that
the
income
of
one
spouse
is
necessarily
and
automatically
available
to
the
other
individual.
there
is
no
longer
any
logical
basis
for
deeming
in
that
context.
mr.
gill
de
ford
i
don't
distinguish,
but
i
think
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
this,
spouses
do
want
to
contribute
to
each
other,
they
do
not
want
to
leave
the
other
hanging
in
the
nursing
home
and
say,
good
luck.
a
person
with
$5000
is
likely
to
make
the
best
contribution
that
he
or
she
can
make.
i'd
also
say
that
a
person
who
has
$5000
a
month
income,
the
spouse
probably
would
not
be
eligible
for
medicaid,
if
that's
the
person
making
the
contribution.
if
the
spouse
with
$5000...
if
that
person
simply
refuses
to
make
the
contribution,
then
the
state
has
the
right
to
go
into
state
court
and
obtain
a
necessary
contribution,
and
a
reasonable
contribution.
i'd
like
to
point
but
also,
that
this
court
in
similar
cases
involving
the
afdc
program
has
apparently
shown
some
disenchantment
with
exactly
the
procedure
used
here,
and
in
van
lare
v.
hurley
and
lewis
v.
martin,
this
court
emphasized
that
states
cannot
include
income
available
to
an
applicant
for
afdc
which
is
not
in
fact
available.
one
of
those
cases,
the
court
stated
that
the
bread
can
only
be
counted
when
it
is
actually
set
on
the
table.
there's
another
important
aspect
of
those
two
cases.
in
van
lare,
the
court
noted
that
deeming
in
that
context,
directed
against
a
lodger
living
in
the
house,
who
might
not
be
contributing
to
the
support
of
the
applicant
child,
that
the
state
could
not
move
against
the
lodger
by
essentially
holding
that
child
blackmail.
and
that
is
exactly
what
deeming
in
this
context
amounts
to.
the
state
is
using
the
guilt
or
whatever
of
the
non
institutionalized
spouse...
about
the
institutionalized
spouse,
in
order
to
force
a
support
payment.
and
that
support
payment,
we
submit,
can
only
be
obtained
through
the
regular
state
judicial
process.
the
state
cannot
say
to
the
non
institutionalized
spouse,
well,
you
can
either
contribute
the
$150
a
month,
or
ultimately
your
spouse
is
going
to
be
evicted
from
the
nursing
home.
the
purpose
of
the
medicaid
program
was
to
guarantee
that
individuals
who
needed
necessary
health
care
and
did
not
have
sufficient
income
regardless
of
the
reason
why
they
didn't
have
sufficient
income,
would
obtain
needed
health
care.
in
this
instance,
that
health
care
is
ultimately
going
to
be
denied
because
the
state
is
trying
to
force
the
other
spouse
to
cooperate.
it's
trying
to
put...
is
putting
and
is
holding
the
institutionalized
spouse,
essentially
a
hostage,
in
this
game
in
an
effort
to
obtain
support
from
the
non
institutionalized
spouse.
mr.
gill
de
ford
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
with
the
government's
interpretation
of
209(b)
option.
the
209(b)
option
is
not
necessarily
a
more
restrictive
or
a
less
liberal
program
than
the
ssi
procedure.
209(b)
option
is
essentially
an
effort
to
give
the
states
the
flexibility--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--no.
i
don't,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
there's
a
stronger
argument
in
that
instance,
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
medicaid
statute
and
the
ssi
statute.
but
i
think
there's
also
a
strong
argument
that
subsection
17
of
the
medicaid
statute
precludes
deeming
in
either
kind
of
state.
but
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
209(b)
options
essentially
gives
the
states
the
right
to
choose
whatever
medicaid
rules
they
want,
with
only
one
proviso...
that
they
cannot
be
any
more
restrictive
than
those
in
effect
in
1972.
it
was
an
effort
to
give
the
states
some
flexibility;
they
could
choose
to
go
with
ssi,
as
about
two
thirds
of
the
states
have
done.
that
gives
the
states
much
more
administrative
convenience
because
the
social
security
administration
will
then
determine
medicaid
eligibility
for
them
and
they
don't
have
to
go
through
that
process.
if
the
states
want
to
use
more
restrictive
rules,
they
can
by
choosing
a
209(b)
option.
they
then
have
the
administrative
burdens
which
comes
with
that.
at
the
same
time,
however,
they
are
required
to
use
the
spend
down
mechanism,
which
is
probably
the
most
liberal
element
that
congress
has
included
in
the
medicaid
statute.
and
that
allows
individuals
whose
incomes
might
be
slightly
over
the
cash
assistance
levels
to
spend
down
and
obtain
eligibility.
the
209(b)
option
was
a
choice
that
congress
gave
the
states.
it
set
no
maximum
eligibility
levels
for
those
states
which
chose
the
209(b)
option.
therefore,
we
don't
believe
that
the
ssi
statute
is
in
any
way
related
to
this
particular
case
involving
209(b)--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
de
ford
the
statute
does
not
say
anything
about
maximum
eligibility
levels.
it
begins
by
saying
that
notwithstanding--
mr.
gill
de
ford
--as
long
as
it
was
in
effect
in
1972.
mr.
gill
de
ford
that
is
the
government's
position,
but
the
statute
does
not
say
that.
mr.
gill
de
ford
the
statute
has
no
language
about
using
the
ssi
rules
as
the
most
liberal
which
a
state
can
use.
any
other
questions.
thank
you.
