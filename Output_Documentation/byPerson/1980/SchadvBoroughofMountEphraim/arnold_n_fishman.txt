mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
less
than
5,000
people,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
is
being
decided
here
today
is
the
right
and
power
of
a
small
residential
community,
primarily
residential
community,
to
determine
its
character.
in
every
residential
community
traffic
patterns
create
major
arteries.
the
land
fronting
on
those
arteries
by
virtue
of
the
traffic
patterns
becomes
unuseable
for
residential
use
and
suitable
for
commercial
purposes.
at
the
same
time
the
residents
of
those
communities
demand
and
desire
that
some
of
their
commercial
needs
be
met
within
the
community.
in
that
context
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
has
adopted
a
comprehensive
zoning
ordinance
in
an
effort
to
accommodate
all
of
these
interests.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
that
this
ordinance
regulates
between
live
entertainment
and
nonlive
entertainment.
and
yet
if
you
will
look
at
the
ordinance
itself
entertainment
is
not
addressed
at
all.
what
we
have
created
here
is
a
retail
zone
for
the
sale
of
retail
products
and
services
to
the
local
inhabitants.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that
moving
picture
theater,
your
honor,
would
be
a
nonconforming
use--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--that's
correct.
it
is
correct
from--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--but
it
is
correct
on
a
basis,
not
that
we
distinguish
live
entertainment
and
nonlive
entertainment.
it
was
felt,
since
the
movies
which
are
viewed
are
movies
that
sold
by
the
appellant,
certainly
we
can't
regulate
how
these
people
sell
their
product.
if
they
want
to
permit
somebody
to
view
the
product...
in
the
same
way
that
you
can
walk
into
a
bookstore
and
leaf
through
the
book
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
want
to
buy
it...
if
they
want
to
permit
you
to
view
the
film
prior
to
its
purchase,
certainly
the
borough
cannot
regulate
how
they
sell
their
product.
i
can
remember
times
when
if
you
wanted
to
buy
a
phonograph
record
you
went
into
a
store
and
you
took
the
record,
you
put
it
on
a
phonograph,
and
you
listened
to
it.
if
you
liked
it,
you
bought
it.
if
you
didn't,
you
didn't.
there
was
no
move
against
the
filmed
entertainment
because
it
was
felt
that
the
borough
could
not
regulate
the
way
in
which
these
products
were
sold.
and
what
this
is
is
a
zone
for
selling
things
to
the
consuming
public
of
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim.
it
is
not--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--judge
deighan's
rationale
as
i
understand
it
is,
he
found
that
appellant's
live
entertainment
was
first
amendment
protected,
but
was
nonetheless
subject
to
the
reasonable
exercise
of
the
zoning
power
of
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim.
you
have
to
appreciate,
your
honor,
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a,
well,
mr.
abrams
indicated
that
perhaps
there
would
be
a
community
small
enough
and
sleepy
enough...
i
think
i
represent
that
community.
mount
ephraim
is
less
than
one
square
mile,
it
has
less
than
5,000
people,
it
has
less
than
2,000
homes.
it
exists
on
the
periphery
of
the
philadelphia
market
area.
these
uses
are
accommodated
not
only
in
camden
county
but
in
philadelphia
county
and
in
the
surrounding
areas.
we
have
a
true
bedroom
community
here.
it's
got
three
zones,
or
one
or
two,
basically,
distinction,
single
family,
multi
family;
and
commercial.
and
we
have
defined
that
commercial
zone
by
listing
those
uses
which
we
permit.
and
in
case
there
be
any
doubt
about
our
attempting
to
establish
a
retail
sales
zone,
the
ordinance
provides
retail
stores
such
as,
but
not
limited
to,
and
then
it
lists
a
lot
of
things.
so
there
is
no...
when
you
talk
about,
can
you
have
a
flower
shop?
the
answer
is
yes.
can
you
have
a
gift
shop?
of
course.
even
if
they're
not
in
there.
the
answer
is--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
you
can
have
all
of
those
things.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that's
correct.
that's
a
separate
provision
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
absolutely.
for
example,
there
is
nothing
in
the
ordinance
which
gives
the
appellant
the
right
specifically
to
sell
films.
but
surely
the
borough
couldn't
distinguish
between
selling
records,
selling
books,
selling
films.
this
is
a
zone
to
sell
things
to
the
community.
so
we
never
moved
against
the
sale
of
films,
and
we
can't
move,
in
my
opinion,
at
least,
against
the
way
in
which
those
films
are
sold.
but
this
is
not
an
entertainment
zone.
entertainment
is
afforded
through--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
don't
think
the
borough
could
prohibit
the
record
shop
from
charging
the
customer
a
dime
or
a
quarter
to
listen
to
the
record
even
if
he
was
going
to
buy
it.
i
don't
think
that
the
borough
has
a
right
to
get
behind
the
cash
register
and
tell
somebody
how
to
run
his
business.
this
matter
arises
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution
where
the
burden
is
clearly
on
the
state
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
we
couldn't
pick
what
we
considered
to
be
close
situations.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
don't
think
any
of
that
is
involved.
what
is
involved
is
that
if
you
view
a
film
in
a
peepshow,
you
can
then
come
down
and
purchase
that
film.
and
once
you--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--no.
you
pay
money
for
that
viewing.
i
don't
see,
however,
where
that
makes
any
constitutional
significance
at
all.
additionally,
what
i
fail
to
appreciate
about
the
appellants'
argument,
it
seems
as
though
everyone
is
willing
to
concede
that
in
a
residential
zone
the
outlawing
or
prohibition
of
any
of
the
matters
that
we've
been
talking
about
now
is
permissible,
and
yet
the
appellant
would
have
you
believe
that
commercial
is
an
all
or
nothing
proposition,
and
i
don't
really
understand
that
argument.
certainly,
if
some
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
between
commercial
uses
can
be
found,
then
a
classification
based
upon
this
kind
of
commercial
or
that
kind
of
commercial
has
got
to
be
as
constitutionally
sound
as
a
classification
based
upon
residential--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--i
agree
that
the
ordinance
prohibits
the
utilization
of
land
and
structures
in
the
commercial
zone--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--for
any
live
entertainment,
shakespeare--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that's
incorrect.
if
a
person...
a
lot
of
examples
have
been
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
have
christmas
carols
at
the
office
christmas
party.
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
it
would
ban
a
theater.
it
would
not
necessarily
ban
a
play.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
at
the
point
that
the
structure
or
land
ceases
to
be
an
office
or
a
home
and
becomes
either
a
theater
or
an
opera
house
or
a
concert
hall
or
a
sports
arena
or
whatever,
at
that
point
it
offends
the
zoning
ordinance
because
this
ordinance
is
created
as
a
retail
sales
zone
to
satisfy
the
immediate
needs--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--you're
asking
for
a
compelling
state
interest?
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
didn't
think
i
do
because
i
don't
really
think
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
but
i'll
be
privileged
to
respond
to
the
question.
i
think
that
a
compelling
state
interest--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--absolutely.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
absolutely.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
certainly;
and
has.
at
least,
and
has
if
they're
going
to
utilize
the
land
or
structures
of
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim,
it
has.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
don't
think
you
could...
no,
you
cannot,
your
honor,
you
cannot.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
the
line
may...
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
at
the
moment
that
the
structure
in
which
it
is
being
performed
ceases
to
become
a
high
school
and
becomes
something
other
than
that.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
yes,
it
does--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--perhaps
not
on
a
one
time
basis,
but--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--"deegan".
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
well,
i
think
there
are
several
justifications.
one
is
that
zoning
in
and
of
itself
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
i
think
that
the
combining
of
compatible
uses
into
zones
and
the
blending
of
compatible
zones
into
a
comprehensive
zoning
ordinance
of
compatible
zones
into
a
comprehensive
zoning
ordinance
is
as
has
been
said
by
this
court
the
most
essential
function
performed
by
local
government
because
it's
in
that
way
that
the
quality
of
life
in
these
communities
can
be
preserved.
officially,
the
devotion
of
the
limited
amount
of
commercial
space
that
a
town
like
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
has
to
the
satisfaction
of
immediate
needs
of
the
residents
of
a
borough
is
certainly
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
avoidance
of
those
problems
inherent
in
the
omitted
uses
of
live
entertainment,
like
traffic,
crowds,
parking,
trash,
demands
for
medical
and
police
facilities,
the
avoidance
of
these
things
for
a
borough
like
mount
ephraim
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
so
at
each
of
these
levels
i
think
a
compelling
state
interest
has
been
shown.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
you
have
to
appreciate,
your
honor,
that
that
movie--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--you
have
to
appreciate
that
that
movie
is
a
nonconforming
use
in
our
borough,
your
honor.
it
precedes
anyone's
memory,
it
precedes
any
zoning
ordinance,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
movie
would
be
a
permissible
use
were
it
to
move
into
town
today.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i'm
at
a
loss,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
no,
because
that
is...
at
least,
it
could
be
argued
and
it
probably
would
be
argued
that
that
is
the
method
by
which
they
choose
to
sell
their
movies.
in
that
way
it
would
become
an
accessory
use
to
their
sale
of
films,
which
is
clearly
permitted,
even
though
not
specifically
mentioned,
under
the
phrase,
"retail
stores
such
as.
"
"but
not
limited
to.
"
additionally,--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--are
we
discussing
the
movie,
sir?
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
this
motion
picture,
or
a
movie?
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
yes,
sir.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
believe
so,
sir.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
yes,
it
could
be
so
viewed.
and
the
first
place,
of
course,
didn't
get
there
because
we
just
didn't
close
our
eyes
and
permit
it
to
come
in
in
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
it
got
there
before
the
ordinance,
and
our
ordinance
has
a
saving
nonconforming
use
provision
across
the
board.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
think
so,
although
that's
not
present
at
all.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
understand
this,
your
honor,
but
it
exists.
i
think
mr.
levy
was
questioned
about
that
in
appellant's
exhibit.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
no,
sir.
a
movie
in
a
dinner
theater,
i
don't
think
would
be
an
accessory
use.
there
are
only
three--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--the
land
of
the
borough--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--that's
correct.
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
has
created
a
commercial
zone
to
satisfy
the
immediate
needs
of
the
residents.
it's
a
bedroom
community.
if
you
come
home
at
night
and
you
forgot
to
buy
your
bread,
your
milk,
your
gift--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--i
think
so,
sir.
we
proceeded
on
the
theory
of
live
entertainment
in
the
municipal
court
because
we
wanted
as
narrow
an
imposition
as
possible.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
thank
you.

[recess.]
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
submitted
by
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
that
this
ordinance
passes
every
constitutional
test
developed
under
the
first
amendment.
we
passed
the
o'brien
test,
in
that
clearly
the
ordinance
is
within
the
power
of
government
and
clearly
is
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression.
these
points
are
actually
conceded
by
the
appellant.
the
appellant,
however,
denies
that
we
advance
a
significant
governmental
interest
or
that
the
ordinance
is
sufficiently
narrow
so
as
to
not
impinge
upon
the
first
amendment
any
more
than
is
necessary.
we
submit
that
we
do
advance
a
significant
governmental
interest,
as
i've
said
before,
because
zoning
in
and
of
itself
is
not
just
a
significant
governmental
interest
but
perhaps
the
most
essential
governmental
interest
served
by
any
local
community.
in
addition,
what
we
have
really
striven
to
do
in
this
matter
is
devote
the
limited
amount
of
commercial
land
which
fronts
on
this
main
highway
through
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
to
satisfy
the
immediate
needs
of
the
residents
of
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim,
and
in
so
doing
we
contend
that
we
advance
a
significant
governmental
interest.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
that
i've
handled,
only
one,
and
that's
all
i
would
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
this
is
the
only
attempt
at
entertainment
that
has
ever
come
into
the
town
of
mount
ephraim
that
i
am
aware
of,
and
i've
been
its
prosecutor
for
a
number
of
years,
sir.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
there
are
three
restaurants
in
the
town
that
offer
music
with
the
meal.
the
municipal
court
found
that
that
music
with
a
meal
is
an
accessory
use
and
in
addition
to
that
a
hearing
was
held
on
the
issue
of
selective
enforcement,
which
was
the
only
testimony
ever
taken
in
this
matter,
and
at
that
hearing
everyone
testified
that
those
uses
predated
any
ordinance
that
anyone
could
remember.
so
that
they
would
be
the
only
live
entertainment
in
the
town,
and
they
would
be
there
by
virtue
of
the
nonconforming
use,
and
also--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--or
the
only
nonconforming
entertainment;
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
well,
we
don't
ban
entertainment.
what
we
do
is
we
regulate
the
use
of
buildings
and
structures
within
the
town.
if
someone
wanted,
for
example--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--that's
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
this
zone
has
been
created
in
order
to
sell
things
and
provide
those--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--that's
correct.
entertainment
is
accommodated
throughout
the
county
of
camden;
specifically,
live
nude
entertainment
is
accommodated
throughout
the
county
of
camden,
and
it
has
to
be
remembered
that
the
traditional
concepts
of
zoning...
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
my
brief
is
village
of
valley
view
v.
proffett.
and
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
traditional
concepts
of
zoning
envision
a
community
as
a
self
contained
unit
containing
its
own...
or,
a
municipality
as
a
self
contained
unit,
and
containing
its
own
residential,
commercial,
and
industrial
areas.
mount
ephraim,
like
valley
view,
is
on
the
periphery
of
a
huge
metropolitan
center
and
it
is
not
a
self
contained
unit,
it
is,
as
they
said
in
that
case,
merely
an
adventitious
fragment
of
the
social
and
economic
whole,
and
as
such
what
is
really
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
or
any
such
small
residential
community
has
the
right
and
the
power
to
determine
its
character,
what
it's
going
to
look
like
in
the
future.
we
have
a
town
in
mount
ephraim
called
tavestock.
according
to
the
1980
census
figures,
tavestock
has
four
homes
and
nine
residents.
certainly
an
inappropriate
town
for
entertainment.
we
have
another
town
called
pine
valley
borough,
has
24
residents
and
14
homes,
another
town
in
which
uses
of
this
nature
or
entertainment
in
general
just
doesn't
make
sense.
the
county
of
camden
is
comprised
of
37
separate
municipalities.
some
of
those
municipalities
are
the
type
of
municipalities
where
this
use
would
properly
be
accommodated
and
in
some
of
those
municipalities
it
just
really
doesn't
make
sense.
this
court
in
young
v.
american
mini
theatres
sustained
a
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction
for
the
city
of
detroit.
implicit
in
that
decision
is
that
the
city
of
detroit
could
prohibit
these
uses
or
any
entertainment
uses
or
any
commercial
uses
or
commercial
speech
uses
from
the
residential
areas
of
detroit.
well,
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
is
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
those
residential
areas
of
a
large
metropolitan
area.
the
fact
that
we
have
37
governing
bodies
instead
of,
let's
say,
a
county
wide
planning
board...
if
we
had
a
county
wide
planning
board,
it
would
be
extremely
rational
to
not
permit
mount
ephraim
to
have
an
entertainment
zone.
it's
just
not
that
kind
of
a
town.
the
entertainment
zone
would
most
probably
be
located
in
more
of
the
downtown
area.
we're
on
the
outskirts
of
a
large
market
area.
the
philadelphia
market
area
encompasses
five
counties
in
pennsylvania
and
three
counties
in
new
jersey,
and
certainly
every
municipality
encompassed
within
that
sprawling
megalopolis
does
not
need
to
accommodate
all
commercial
uses,
be
they
constitutionally
protected
or
not.
i
maintained
initially
that
this
really...
i
submit
that
there
are
really
no
constitutional
issues
presented
in
this
matter.
i
say
that
because
it
would
seem
to
me
of
necessity
that
before
a
content
neutral
zoning
ordinance,
clearly
valid
on
its
face,
can
be
held
to
implicate
first
amendment
principles,
there
must
of
necessity
be
some
type
of
a
constitutional
showing
that
the
use
is
not
accommodated
elsewhere
in
the
community
at
large,
and
there
should
also
be
some
obligation
to
establish
that
the
proposed
site
of
this
use
is
at
least
reasonably
suitable
to
accommodate
the
use.
there's
been
no
showing;
the
record
is
barren
with
respect
to
that.
this
could,
for
example,
and
does,
according
to
the
strip
type
commercial
uses
that
have
grown
up
in
the
town
of
mount
ephraim,
backs
up
on
residences,
on
home
upon
home
upon
home.
that's
an
inappropriate
place
to
place
this
kind
of
a
use.
the
library
of
congress,
as
wonderful
an
institution
as
that
may
be,
just
doesn't
belong
everywhere.
there
are
some
places
where
that
is
inappropriate.
and
the
real
issue
before
this
court
is,
who
is
to
decide
where
these
uses
are
appropriate?
appellants'
argument
would
have
you
graft
on
every
such
zoning
ordinance,
change
the
definition
of
every
such
zoning
ordinance
to
include
constitutionally
permissible
uses.
and
in
so
doing
you
are
really
being
asked
to
homogenize
zoning
at
the
national
level.
if
there
is
anything
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
homogenization
at
the
national
level,
it's
zoning.
at
the
municipal
level,
where
these
zoning
decisions
are
made,
you
have
decisions
like,
let's
not
put
the
drainage
ditch
here
because
mrs.
jones'
septic
tank
backs
up
when
it
rains
now.
there
is
local
expertise
that
goes
into
the
creation
of
a
comprehensive
zoning
ordinance
at
the
local
level
which
this
court
should
not
interfere
with.
there
is
expertise
that
really
must
of
necessity
be
deferred
to.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
you
phrase
it
negatively.
i'd
rather
phrase
it
positively,
if
i
may,
to
answer
your
question.
we
haven't
decided
not
to
have
entertainment.
what
we
have
decided
is
to
create
a
zone
which
is
devoted
to
selling
things
that
satisfy
the
immediate
needs
of
the
residents.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
yes,
you
can,
sir.
you
can
sell
newspapers,
you
can
sell
almost--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--oh,
frankly,
i--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--i
agree.
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
think
that's
probably
accurate.
what
we're
trying
to
achieve
here
is
to
create
a
commercial
zone
to
satisfy
the
immediate
needs
of
the
residents
of
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
and
that's
what
we've
done,
or
that's
what
we've
striven
to
do,
and
to
engraft
upon
that
definition
all
constitutionally
protected
uses
would
bring
about
bizarre
results.
the
illustration
that
justice
marshall
just
gave.
certainly
newspapers
are
constitutionally
protected,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
can
put
up
the
large
newspaper
factories
that
are
necessary
to
create,
the
printing
presses
that
are
necessary
to
create
a
newspaper
in
any
place.
there
are
some
places
where
that
use
is
inappropriate.
now,
if
a
newspaper
could
come
to
our
courts...
our
courts
are
sensitive
to
these
problems.
in
the
mt.
laurel
decision
which
i'm
sure
you
gentlemen
are
familiar
with,
coming
out
of
new
jersey...
i
think
it's
been
before
this
court...
we
found
that
a
constitutional
right
was
being
denied,
not
just
by
one
municipality
but
by
zoning
ordinances
throughout
burlington
county
and
camden
county
as
well.
if
a
newspaper
could
come
to...
it
wouldn't
have
to
get
to
this
court,
if
it
would
come
to
our
local
courts...
and
say,
listen,
we've
looked
at
all
of
the
zoning
ordinances
available
and
the
only
place
we
can
print
our
papers
is
west
of
the
mississippi
river,
a
constitutional
issue
has
clearly
been
presented.
and
if
the
proposed
site
is
a
site
reasonably
which
would
accommodate
that
use,
i
think
our
courts
would
be
sensitive
to
that.
but
there
is
no
showing
here
that
this
use
is
in
any
way
denied
access
to
the
market,
not
just
within
the
confines
of
this
one
square
mile,
but
in
the
community
at
large.
and
so
long
as
it
is
accommodated
in
the
community
at
large,
then
this
ordinance
becomes
just
a
reasonable
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
time
is
not
implicated
in
any
way,
manner
directs
itself
to
the
live
entertainment,
and
place,
in
one
sense,
is
no
place
in
mount
ephraim--
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
--on
a
commercial
basis?
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
a
school?
mr.
arnold
n.
fishman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
that
would
be
my
opinion.
i
would
so
urge
a
court,
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
local
courts
would
follow
my
need,
but
i
do
believe
that
what
we
have
striven
to
do
was
accommodate
just
the
immediate
needs
of
the
borough
in
terms
of,
have
i
forgotten
something?
i
can
send
my
kid
to
the
store.
he
can
buy
those
things
which
we're
going
to
need.
thank
you.
