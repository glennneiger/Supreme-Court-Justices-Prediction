justice
white
well,
the
courts
of
new
jersey
have
interpreted
this
ordinance
to
forbid
what
you
want
to
do.
justice
white
so
it's
been
officially
interpreted
and
applied
to
you,
your
client.
justice
white
well,
it's
been
applied
to
you
because
you're
wanting
to
show
what
the
courts
of
new
jersey
have
held
to
be
live
entertainment,
and
that
is
banned
by
this
ordinance.
justice
white
and
so,
as
applied
to
you,
you're
claiming
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
justice
white
and
then
you
also
say,
i
suppose,
that
you're
entitled
because
it's
a
first
amendment
case
to
say
that
because
it
also
bans
bookstores,
that
the
ordinance
is
invalid?
justice
white
well,
i
mean...
well,
you
mean
as
applied?
justice
white
how
do
you
know
it
doesn't
ban
bookstores?
justice
white
i
see.
all
right.
well,
do
you
contend
that
a
town
such
as
mount
ephraim
could
not
totally
ban
any
commercial
enterprise?
justice
white
well,
you
can
say
it's
a
time,
place,
and
manner
provision
in
the
sense
that
it
permits
entertainment
in
certain
ways,
but
it
doesn't
permit
live
entertainment.
justice
white
i
don't
know
why
you
aren't
in
a
position
to
make
that
argument
now,
because
that's
why
your
operation
is
in
trouble
on
account
of
the
ordinance,
because
it
is
live
entertainment
according
to
the
authorities.
justice
white
how
about
newspapers?
justice
white
but,
you
do
agree,
or
don't
you,
that
the
ordinance
bans
all
live
entertainment?
justice
white
for
any
live
entertainment?
justice
white
and,
of
course,
i
take
it
that
a
live
entertainment
is
not
permitted
in
any
other
zone?
justice
white
so
there
is
no
live
entertainment
in
the
borough?
justice
white
but
there
is
no
commercial
live
entertainment?
justice
white
in
the
city?
justice
white
and
so
it
would
ban
a
play,
any
kind
of
a
play,
for
example?
justice
white
well,
it
would
ban
a
commercial
theater.
justice
white
or
a
circus.
justice
white
and
it
would
ban
any
kind
of
commercial
live
entertainment,
any
kind
of
live
entertainment
for
which
a
fee
is
charged
for
profit,
profit
making?
justice
white
now,
what's
your
justification
for
saying
that
the
ordinance
is
valid
even
though
it
forbids
any,
although
it
forbids
among
other
things
a
commercial
theater
with
a
live
cast?
justice
white
yes.
what
is
your...
well,
i'm
asking
your
justification.
i
don't
know
whether
you
concede
that
you
have
to
show
a
compelling
interest.
justice
white
well,
you
would
agree
that
live
entertainment
in
some
forms,
at
least,
is
entitled
to
first
amendment
protection?
justice
white
like
a
theater?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
that
covers
the
situation
if
the
owner
of
the
motion
picture
theater
says,
by
the
way,
i
would...
three
nights
a
week
are
going
to
be
movies
and
three
nights
a
week
are
going
to
be
plays?
justice
white
that,
you
would
say,
movies
are
all
right
and
plays
are
not,
or
not?
justice
white
well,
what
about...
does
the
ordinance
ban
the
showing
in
this
store
that
we
have
here,
this
adult
bookstore,
of
movies?
justice
white
well,
if
a...
could
there
be
a
dinner
theater
that
didn't
have
a
live
play
but
which
showed
movies
in
connection
with
their
restaurant
operation?
justice
white
you're
really
saying
that
since
it's
not
permitted
there's
no
entertainment
of
any
kind
permitted
in
the
borough
commercially?
justice
white
whether
it's
live
or
not
live?
justice
white
do
you
think
that's
the
way
your
new
jersey
courts
construed
this
ordinance
as
banning
all
entertainment
rather
than
just
all
live
entertainment?
justice
white
or
the
only
entertainment?
justice
white
or
any
entertainment,
conforming
or
nonconforming.
justice
white
i
know,
but
there
can't
be
any
commercial
business
in
entertainment
in
a
building?
justice
white
you
can't
sell
entertainment
under
the
zoning
ordinance?
justice
white
could
you
have
a
commercial
adult
education
establishment
in
mount
ephraim
along
the
strip
there?
you
are
teaching
people
how
to
be
mechanics
or
how
to
vote,
or
things
about
citizenship?
people
are
just,
are
willing
to
pay
to
learn
something,
so
they--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
commercial
school,
proprietary
school.
