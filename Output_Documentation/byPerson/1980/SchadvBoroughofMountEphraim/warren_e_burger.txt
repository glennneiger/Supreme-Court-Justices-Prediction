chief

warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
schad
v.
borough
of
mount
ephraim.
mr.
levy,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
is
this
what
is
euphemistically
called
an
adult
bookstore?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
attacking
this
ordinance
on
its
face,
or
as
applied
to
you?
chief
justice
burger
that
wasn't
a
first
amendment
case,
really,
was
it?
that
was
the
21st
amendment.
chief
justice
burger
no,
it--
chief
justice
burger
--the
21st
amendment
was
what
controlled
larue.
chief
justice
burger
i
would
think
that
larue
reflects
the
idea
that
a
state
may
prohibit
the
sale
of
salted
peanuts
or
potato
chips
in
a
bar
if
it
wants
to.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
go
back
to
what
you
had
said
before.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
municipality
could
not
ban
all
filling
stations?
chief
justice
burger
they
could,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
burger
then
they
could
ban
all
grocery
stores?
chief
justice
burger
just
because
they
don't
want
any
filling
stations,
they
don't
want
any
grocery
stores.
chief
justice
burger
and
they
could
ban
all
liquor
establishments,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
say
they
can't
ban
a
theater?
chief
justice
burger
of
the
kind
you've
got
here?
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you
see
the
belle
terre
case
as
aiding
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
finish
your
sentence;
yes.
chief
justice
burger
i
think
that
answers
my
question
that
i
put
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
levy.
mr.
fishman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
at
1
o'clock.
you
have
some
remaining
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fishman,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
