mr.
levy,
i
should
know,
but
is
mount
ephraim
in
burlington?
justice
jr.
what
county
is
mount
ephraim
in?
i
should
know--
justice
jr.
--oh,
is
it
in
camden?
justice
jr.
where?
south
of
the
city?
justice
jr.
small?
justice
jr.
and
a
very
small
borough,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
i
gather,
mr.
levy,
that
what,
the
key
to
judge
deighan's
opinion
is
that
one
sentence,
is
it,
at
page
12a:
"live
entertainment
is
simply
not
a
permitted
use
in
any
establishment,
regardless
to
whether
there
is
a
relationship
to
nude
entertainment.
"
this
is
the
key
to
it,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
just
across
the
board
barred
any
live
entertainment,
clothed
or
unclothed.
justice
jr.
and
i
gather,
at
least
we've
had
cases
that
indicate
that
live
entertainment
often
has
communicative
aspects
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
play
"hair"...
i've
forgotten
the
name
of
the
case--
justice
jr.
even
the
high
school
play
in
the
movie
theater
would
be
barred
if
they
charged
money
to
raise
money
to
go
to
a
football
game
or
something?
justice
jr.
would
it
not
be?
the
high
school
play--
justice
jr.
--no,
no,
i
asked
about
your
existing
motion
picture
theater.
you
answered
my
brother
marshall
that
it
would
bar
a
play
in
the
motion
picture
theater.
justice
jr.
it
would
bar
the
high
school
putting
on
its
play
in
the?
justice
jr.
well,
that
is
certainly
not
the
way
i
read,
and
i
gather
that's
as
my
brother
stewart
suggested
to
you
earlier,
that's
what
we
have
to
take
as
the
reach
of
this
ordinance,
what
judge
deighan...
is
that
the
way
you
pronounce
it?
justice
jr.
the
way,
that
sentence
i
read
your
colleague
earlier,
that
it
does
not
grant
any
kind
of
live
entertainment.
and
what
is
your...
you
were
going
to
suggest
to
me
what
the
justification
was
for
that.
justice
jr.
but
i
know,
mr.
fishman,
but
don't
we
have
to...
the
only
opinion,
as
justice
stewart
reminded
you
earlier,
is
the
county
court
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
that's
all
we
know
about
what
the
meaning
of
this
ordinance
that
has
been--
