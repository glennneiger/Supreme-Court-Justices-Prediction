what
sort
of
commercial
establishments
are
permitted?
are
there
motion
picture
theaters
and?
justice
stevens
and
taverns?
justice
stevens
restaurants?
justice
stevens
--mr.
levy?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
levy,
please?
justice
stevens
if
the
ordinance
had
totally
banned
motion
pictures,
which
i
thought
it
did,
but
you
told
us
there
is
in
fact
a
motion
picture
theater
on
this
street,
but
that's
a
protected
form
of
communication,
would
you
say
such
an
ordinance
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
it
seems
perfectly
clear,
so
there's
no
vagueness
problem.
justice
stevens
you
have
the
right
to
do
that
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
stevens
so
then
in
a
criminal
trial
the
prosecutor
has
the
burden
of
setting
forth
the
factual
justification
for
the
ordinance?
justice
stevens
the
issue
would
be
the
same
if
it
were
a
motion
picture
theater
or
if
it's
a
place
where
they
have
live
entertainment?
justice
stevens
it'
your
point,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
point.
your
point
is
that
certain
retail
establishments,
even
if
not
expressly
mentioned,
would
be
permitted
because
these
retails
that
are
listed
are
illustrative
of
the
total
rather
than?
justice
stevens
i
was
under
the
impression
that
when
a
customer
viewed
one
of
these
films,
he
had
to
put
a
coin
in
the
viewing--
justice
stevens
--well,
that's
a
little
different
from
the
record
sales,
or
you're
just
doing
it
to
see
if
you
want
to
buy
it.
justice
stevens
mr.
fishman,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
about
the
motion
picture
theater.
you're
saying
this
is
a
nonconforming
use,
meaning
that
it
was
in
existence
before
the
ordinance
was
passed--
justice
stevens
--the
motion
picture
theater.
does
that
mean
that--
justice
stevens
--no,
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
theater,
the--
justice
stevens
--does
that
mean
that
if
someone
else
wanted
to
open
a
motion
picture
theater
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
ordinance?
justice
stevens
so
that
in
a
way
this
is
like,
the
same
case
as
if
this
is
the
second...
this
is
an
application
to...
i
mean,
it's
not
application,
but
if
it
were,
to
be
a
second
place
of
entertainment
within
the
area?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
if
they
had
had
vaudeville
in
that
motion
picture
theater
before
the
ordinance
was
passed,
presumably
they
could
continue
to
have
it
then?
that
would
be
an
exception
to
the
live
entertainment?
justice
stevens
well,
we
didn't
even
know
about
the
motion
picture
theater
until
you
told
us
about
it.
it's
not
even
in
the
record.
