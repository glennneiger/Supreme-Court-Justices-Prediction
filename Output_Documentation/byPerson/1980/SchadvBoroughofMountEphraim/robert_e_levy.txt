mr.
robert
e.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
appellant
in
this
matter
is
a
business
enterprise
that
commenced
its
business
in
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
in
1973.
at
that
time
there
was
a
zoning
ordinance
that
was
in
effect.
the
business
of
the
appellant
was
that
it
sold
at
retail
books,
magazines,
and
films,
and
at
the
same
time
it
operated
an
enterprise
that
is
referred
to
as
a
peepshow
operation.
these
are
booths
which
are
individual
booths
which
have
a
projector
and
a
screen
upon
which
images
can
be
seen.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
euphemistically,
realistically,
and
directly,
sir,
it's
called
an
adult
bookstore.
in
1976,
some
three
years
after
it
began
this
operation,
it
attempted
to
expand
that
operation
by
having
the
equivalent
of
film,
or
in
the
same
location
as
the
film,
in
these
peepshow
booths--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
levy
this
is
in
camden
county,
judge.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
it's
in
camden
county,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
it
is
to
the
south,
and,
i
believe,
to
the
east
of
the
city.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
it's
on
the
black
horse
pike
on
the
way
to
atlantic
city
from
the
camden-philadelphia
area.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
it's
a
small
borough.
it's
about
17
miles,
i
would
estimate,
from
the
city
of
camden
and
from
the
river
which
divides
pennsylvania
from
new
jersey.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
it's
zoned,
if
i
understand,
sir,
in
two
zones.
it
has
a
residential
zone
and
it
provides
for
both
multifamily
and
single
family
in
a
residential
zone,
and
then
it
has
a
commercial
zone.
the
black
horse
pike,
which
is
the
main
artery
between
camden
and
atlantic
city,
cuts
right
through
the
borough.
for
250
feet
on
each
side
of
the
black
horse
pike
you
have
a
commercial
zone,
and
then
the
balance
of
the
community
is
residential,
either
multi
or
single
family.
it
does
not
have
any
zone
that
provides
for
industrial
use.
it's
solely
commercial.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
and/or
residential.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
may
i
call
on
my--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--i
think
that
they
would
have
to
go
beyond
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
in
order
to
provide
sufficient
occupations
for
the--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--that's
right.
there
are,
along
the
entire
length
of
the
black
horse
pike,
on
both
sides,
it
is
commercially
occupied
and
active.
but
there
would
not
be
sufficient
opportunity
for
all
the
inhabitants
to
work.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
would
think
not.
i
think
that
maybe
at
some
time
it
might
have
been.
it
is
certainly,
i
think--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--more
suburban
than
it
is
urban.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
there
is
a
motion
picture
theater.
there
are
restaurants.
there
are
car
showrooms,
used
car
showrooms.
there
are
basically
supermarket
type
as
well
as
discount
type
stores
that
can
be
found
within
the
community.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
taverns?
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
there
are
taverns,
there
are
restaurants
with
liquor
licenses,
and
within
some
of
those
there
is
the
live
entertainment
about
which
we
had
some
colloquy
in
the
lower
courts.
at
the
time
that
we
went
ahead
and
we
put
in
the
peepshow
operation
we
did
it
on
the
strength
of
the
content
of
the
zoning
ordinance.
that's
the
zoning
ordinance
that
said
that
there
was
no
objection
at
all
to
what
has
now
been
determined
to
be
other
than
live
entertainment.
and
we
were
then
confronted
with
the
fact
that
live
entertainment
is
not
a
permitted
use
but
is
prohibited.
and
as
one
looks
at
the
zoning
ordinance
it
becomes
terribly
difficult
to
be
able
to
find
out
how
it
is
that
there
has
been
a
determination
of
such
a
distinction
since
entertainment
is
not
addressed
in
that
ordinance
at
all.
it
does
not
appear.
since
we
are
in
a
commercial
zone,
we
concerned
ourselves
primarily
with
the
commercial
aspect
of
that
zoning
ordinance,
but
there
is
nothing
even
in
the
residential
parts
of
this
ordinance
that
in
any
way
relate
to
entertainment.
now,
an
ad
hoc
determination
has
obviously
been
made
that
commercial
live
entertainment
across
the
board
is
not
a
permitted
use,
but
somehow
or
other
commercial
non
live
entertainment,
which
includes
the
motion
picture
theater,
which
includes
the
fact
that
we
have
been
providing
in
the
peepshow
booths
a
nonlive
type
of
operation.
now,
to
carry
on
the
anomaly
of
this,
if
we
were
to
go
along
with
what
has
been
proposed
to
us,
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
show
a
young
lady
dancing
alive,
nude
or
otherwise,
but
that
i
could
have
taken
a
videotape
of
that
earlier
in
the
morning
and
i
could
present
the
exact
same
performance
on
videotape
in
the
same
booth.
now,
the
question
became,
and
i
think
it's
a
threshold
question,
do
we
have
a
first
amendment
situation
here?
is
the
communicative
quality
of
what
it
is
that
we
are
proposing
specifically,
and
with
respect
to
all
other
entertainment
that's
banned?
do
we
have
a
first
amendment
situation?
because
if
we
do,
then
the
fact
that
there
is
a
power
on
the
part
of
the
municipality
to
enact
zoning,
would
not
in
and
of
itself
immediately
then
set
forth
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
issue?
what
we
have
here
is
a
zoning
issue,
but
it's
a
zoning
issue
where
in
the
very
terms
of
that
zoning
ordinance,
we
have
a
burden,
a
restraint,
an
impingement,
and
finally
a
total
prohibition
of
a
form
of
communication.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
yes,
sir,
at
99-15b,
i
believe,
is
its
designation.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
if
that
is
to
be
interpreted
as
it's
presently
being
interpreted,
i
would
imagine
that
if
you
had
dead
flowers
they
would
be
permitted,
but
live
ones,
because
they
are
live
entertainment--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--no,
sir.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
there
is
one.
it's
right
on
the
black
horse
pike
and
would
be
just
somewhat
to
the
east
of
our
location.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
do
not
see
them
here.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
books
are
allowed
to
be
sold...
between
gifts
and
stationery.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i've
had
the
problem
from
the
outset,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
cannot
literally
come
here
and
say
to
you
that
this
ordinance
is
defective
as
it's
written.
as
it's
written,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
defect.
as
it
is
being
interpreted
and
applied,
there
seems
to
be
an
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights
by
setting
forth
that
everything
that's
not
expressly
permitted
here,
they
are
literally
then
coming
forth
and
saying,
that
bookstores
or
means
of
live
communication
offerings
are
not
permitted.
therefore
i
am
in
a
quandary
because
i
can't
say
to
you
that
this
is
defective
and
therefore
has
to
be
declared
invalid,
but
i
must
say
that
if
this
is
the
springboard
for
the
position
they've
taken,
that
there
has
to
be
a
curbing
on
the
interpretation
that
is
being
placed.
the
ad
hoc
determination
i
stress,
because
the
building
inspector,
who
may
be
the
source
of
our
original
complaints,
changes.
from
time
to
time
officials
do
change
and
the
next
one
may
come
along
and
read
it
even
more
severely
and
now
say,
from
this
text,
even
nonlive
entertainment
is
going
to
be
prohibited.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
exactly.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
if
the
lack
of
any
issue
ever
reaching
a
court
with
respect
to
what
we
do
in
this
location
is
the
equivalent
of
having
approved
what
we're
doing,
it
may
well
be
that
if
they're
sustained
with
this
ordinance
on
the
basis
of
live,
that
they
can
come
back
tomorrow
and
on
the
basis
of
this
ordinance
now
attack
nonlive.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
as
applied
to
us,
and
as
applied
across
the
board.
i
feel
that
we
do
have
standing
just
as
a
citizen
with
respect
to
any
ordinance
that
either
as
written
or
applied
would
have
any
sort
of
effect
of
restraint
on
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
there
is
no
question
that
we
are
arguing
about
its
application
to
us.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
no,
it
doesn't
ban
bookstores.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
as
applied,
as
we
look
at
this
ordinance,
the
fair
warning
that
we
would
normally
be
entitled
to
when
we
are
beginning
to
use
our
enterprise,
i
look
at
this
ordinance
and
i
realize
that
for
three
years
i've
been
allowed
to
offer--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--because
it
specifically
sets
forth
that
as
a
permitted
use
there
are
books.
on
page
3.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
no.
what
happens
is
this:
were
we
to
have
an
ordinance
before
us
that
deals
with
the
desire
to
form
a
noncommercial
entity,
i
would
have
some
difficulty
setting
forth
that
there
has
been
an
infringement
upon
our
rights.
the
moment
the
door
is
open
to
commercial
enterprise,
then
i
think
the
burden
is
on
the
community
to
justify
the
elimination
of
some
and
the
propagation
or
fostering
of
others.
and
we
do
have
some
rules
that
will
set
that
forth.
one
is,
can
they
do
it?
yes,
they
are
empowered
to
enact
zoning
ordinances.
secondly,
that
it
must
be
a
purpose
other
than
that
which
is
the
regulation
of
freedom
of
speech.
and
therefore
this
is
an
omnibus
type
zoning
ordinance.
the
concept
is
to
develop
the
community,
and
therefore
it
is
not
directed
toward
the
regulation
of
freedom
of
speech.
the
third
aspect,
however,
the
moment
they
open
that
unit
to
commercial
enterprises,
is
there
a
substantial,
compelling
reason
that's
being
advanced
by
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
and
is
there
any
other
way
in
which
that
could
have
been
accomplished,
the
furthering
of
that
purpose,
other
than
by
the
total
ban?
and
actually
in
this
instance,
when
we
look
around
the
entire
country
and
we
realize
that
live
entertainment
is
basically
the
rule,
not
the
exception,
it
is
obvious
that
in
the
light
of
regulation
there
are
less
stringent
methods
of
coping
and
curbing
live
entertainment,
not
its
total
ban.
and
if
we
get
into
the
question
again
where
a
community
wants
to
restrict
something
and
allow
others,
into
time,
place,
and
manner,
i
submit
that
there
must
be
the
existence
of
that
which
is
going
to
be
regulated,
and
if
it
doesn't
exist
then
there
can't
be
any
implication
of
time,
place,
or
manner.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
all
right.
let's
submit
that
if
it
were
to
set
forth
that,
if
they
had
given
us
the
benefit
of
an
enactment,
where
time,
place,
and
manner
sets
forth,
no
live,
at
least
under
those
circumstances
we
could
begin
to
question
why
there
is
the
restriction
on
live
as
opposed
to
nonrestriction
of
anything
else.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
according
to
their
reading
of
it.
they
claim
that
there
is
a
restriction
on
live
entertainment.
we
have
set
it
forth,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
due
process
an
equal
protection
of
the
law
argument
here
that
there
is
no
rational
distinction
that
has
been
set
forth
and
if
there
be
the
ability
to
rationally
distinguish
between
live
and
nonlive
entertainment,
we
must
note
the
compelling
force
that
led
to
that
distinction
to
see
if
it's
furthered.
what
is
more
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
zoning
than
if
we
can
show
the
same
performance
on
film
and
can't
show
it
alive?
now,
if
we
get
into
the
questions
that
arose
in
something
like
california
v.
larue,
where
there
at
least
were
hearings
and
there
was
a
full
setting
forth
of
what
it
is
that
was
the
concern
of
the
community
and
what
they
wanted
to
eliminate--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--yes,
but
isn't...
well,
it
was
first
amendment,
but
then
it
was
also--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--one
that
dealt
with
the
21st
amendment.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
well,
what
happened
is
that
it
originally
got
up
before
the
court,
i
think
it
started,
at
least
the
people
who
were
affected
basically
by
larue...
were
talking
in
terms
of
first
amendment...
and
we
found
now
that
there
was
an
interplay
between
the
first
and
the
21st
amendment.
and
then
we
found
out--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--all
right.
i
have
no
problem
with
that,
but
i
think
before
we
get
to
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
a
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
reasoning
that
was
utilized
in
larue
is
the
type
of
reasoning
that
would
be
required,
necessary,
and
essential
in
the
event
that
a
distinction
was
going
to
be
drawn
between
the
live
entertainment
and
the
nonlive
entertainment.
what
are
the
consequences,
what
is
it
that
is
trying
to
be
avoided
by
drawing
that
distinction?
is
it
going
to
be
a
question
of
traffic?
all
communities
have
a
problem
with
traffic.
in
fact
we
couldn't
possibly
generate
the
traffic
of
a
supermarket.
that's
why
we
have
traffic
rules,
that's
why
we
have
policemen,
and
we
don't
come
along
and
ban
all
supermarkets
because
it
creates
a
problem.
it's
possible
no
matter
where
that
there
could
be
unruliness.
we
don't
ban
every
type
of
activity
where
unruliness
may
follow.
what
we
do
is
that
we
form
other
means
of
curbing,
the
less
restrictive
manner
of
achieving
the
purpose
that's
involved
in
the
enactment
and
the
doctrine
of
any
zoning
ordinance.
and
this
is
implicit
where
there
is
a
first
amendment
or
a
fundamental
right,
that
these
must
be
adhered
to;
they
must
be
within
the
contemplation
of
the
community.
here,
through
four
courts,
we
have
yet
to
hear
any
substantial,
compelling,
or
any
other
type
of
interest
to
be
furthered
by
the
restriction
on
live
entertainment.
and
therefore
i
submit
that
time,
place,
and
manner
has
not
been
able
to
be
brought
into
this
matter
because
there
is
no
item
that's
recognized
as
being
worthy,
or
the
object
of
regulation.
unless
we
have
live
entertainment,
then
we
can't
begin
to
talk
about
its
regulation
in
time,
place,
and
manner.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
yes,
and
what
he
did
is,
he--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--as
a
consequence
of
a
zoning
ordinance,
both
of
the
judges
did
that.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
they
do.
what
it
also
means
is
that
across
the
board
live
entertainment
is
not
deemed
to
be
non
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
we
have
in
the
doran
v.
salem
inn
cases
the
fact
that
under
certain
circumstances
it
may
well
be,
but
we
haven't
even
been
given
the
opportunity
of
determining
whether
in
our
situation,
are
we
entitled
to
that
protection?
and
is
there
anything
at
all
that
we
do
that
may
thereafter
take
from
us
that
protection?
we
have
been
told
across
the
board,
from
the
very
outset,
no
way;
you
can't
do
it.
because
we
have
the
power
to
enact
zoning
and
it
is
given
a
presumption
of
validity;
that's
it.
and
throughout
all
of
the
documents
submitted
throughout
all
of
the
courts
including
this
one,
we
have
emphasized
that
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case;
it's
a
zoning
case.
but
i
submit
that
it's
a
combination
of
the
two.
it's
a
zoning
case
which
does
impinge
upon
first
amendment
freedoms
and
therefore
the
community
now
has
the
burden
of
establishing
the
necessity
for
banning
totally
and
would
equally
have
had
the
problem
had
it
not
been
a
total
ban,
to
set
forth
how
much
of
a
ban
it
could
justify
in
terms
of
some
sort
of
interest
which
it
was
attempting
to
further
and--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--without
infringing
beyond
that
which
would
become
necessary--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--yes,
sir,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
would
say
that--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--i
would
say
that,
again,
we
would
have
the
problem
of
putting
the
community
to
the
test.
a
community
can
enact
and
there's
nothing
i
can
do
to
prevent
it
from
enacting,
but
the
moment
it
enacts
and
my
toes
are
stepped
upon,
i
have
the
right
to
go
in
and
set
forth
that
this
is
a
prior
restraint.
i
have
the
right
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
validity
of
what
you've
enacted
and
you
must
now
justify
for
me--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--what
i
do
is,
i
attempt
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
statute
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
and
therefore
contain
it
within
that.
i
have
made
my--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--he
has
that
burden.
i
challenge
the
validity
of
the
statute
and
i
feel
that,
presumptively,
the
moment
that
there
is
a
challenge
and
that
i
can
show
the
court
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
involved,
that
it
now
becomes
the
obligation
on
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
community
to
justify
that
cutting
back
on
what
would
be
a
presumptive,
protected
right.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
would
say
it's
exactly
the
same
wherever
there's
a
first
amendment
issue
involved.
the
community
must
support
and
substantiate
its
cutting
back,
its
restraint.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
have
said
that,
and
if
that
were
part
of
the
unspoken
part
of
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
then
i
would
have
answered
it
the
same
way.
i
understood
his
question
to
say
that
they
were
going
to
only
rule
out
motion
picture
theaters.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
a
community
can
set
forth
that
it
will
be
totally
residential,
and
i
think
it
might
meet
all
of
the
o'brien
problems.
i
think
it
has
the
right
to
make
that
sort
of
an
enactment.
i
think
there's
a
purpose
that
would
be
served.
i
think
you
could
set
forth
that
that
purpose
would
be
furthered
by
the
fact
that
we
eliminate
all
commerce.
we
don't
want
trucks
who
are
delivering,
we
don't
want
any
of
those
things,
and
that
it
possibly
is
the
most
least
restrictive
method
of
coping
with
that.
but
the
moment
they
open
the
door
to
discount
stores
and
gasoline
stations...
by
the
way,
if
you
look
at
this
ordinance,
it's
strange;
it
doesn't
even
allow
gasoline
stations
as
a
permitted
use.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
it's
not
listed
here,
unless
it's
an
accessory
use
to
books
or
stationery,
which
are
both
allowed.
but
then
you'd
have
to
make
a
quality
judgment
of
accessory
use.
but
i
submit
that
if
they
wanted
to
eliminate
all
commerce,
that
that
would
be
then
necessary
that
they
eliminate
all
commerce.
and
then
we
have
the
problem
of,
if
a
doctor
or
dentist
has
his
office
within
the
town,
have
they
really
strictly
kept
it
to
all
commerce?
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
would
have
some
problem
being
able
to
speak
as
forcibly
about
the
situation
as
i
do
about
this
situation.
i
would
have
some
difficulty
with
some
of
the
prongs
of
what
i
call
the
o'brien
test.
there's
no
question
that
two
of
those
are
satisfied
immediately.
they
have
complied.
they
have
the
power,
and
it
is
not
addressed
to
first
amendment
rights
directly.
there
are
other
purposes
which
are
being
furthered.
whether
or
not
they
will...
that
purpose
will
be
furthered
by
the
total
ban
may
well
be
something
that
we
have
to
think
about
in
terms
of
that
which
preceded
the
enactment
and
then
further,
whether
or
not
there's
any
other
less
restrictive
manner
in
which
that
type
of
purpose
can
be
served.
and
therefore
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
enlargement
of
the
proposition
to
include
whatever
factual
situation
there
was,
what
it
is
that
they're
trying
to
undo
or
prevent
happening?
but
at
least
if
they
would
follow
the
same
possible
course
and
road,
and
meet
all
of
these
problems
that
are
their
obligation
and
their
burden,
it
may
well
be
the
courts
would
decide
that
you
could
have
a
totally
residential
and
noncommercial
unit.
but
once
the
door
is
opened
and
a
distinction
is
made
with
respect
to
any
commerce,
then
i
think
you
have
to
treat
it
as
if
it's
a
community
with
commerce
and
then
under
what
guise
or
right
could
they
prevent
us
from
bringing
in
our
form
of
commerce?
now,
there
have
been
some
other
suggestions
as
to
what
it
is
that
we
might
be
able
to
do
here.
you
have
to
understand
that
at
the
time
that
we
became
aware
of
the
interpretation
of
this
ordinance,
it
was
a
consequence
of
being
served
with
criminal
process,
so
we
were
already
in
the
courts.
a
suggestion
that
we
go
ahead
and
get
a
variance
i
think
would
violate
both
freedman
and
blount.
there
is
just
no
way
at
all
that
we
can
get
a
speedy
determination
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
not
cast
upon
the
community.
in
a
variance
we
take
on
all
the
burdens
of
showing
that
we
will
not
in
any
way
transgress
what
it
is
is
the
purpose
of
the
enactment
of
the
zoning
ordinance
and
that
we
won't
be
violating
health,
welfare,
morals,
and
the
rest.
there
is
a
further
suggestion
in
the
documents
that
have
been
presented
to
you,
that
we
have
a
right
to
go
into
chancery
and
that
we
can
get
a
restraining
order.
and
what
happens
is
that
that
rule
in
chancery
deals
with
civil
cases
and
we
were
already
in
a
criminal
case.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
courts
will
begin
to
in
any
way
enjoin
pending
criminal
proceedings,
donbrowski
v.
pfister
being
one
of
the
cases
that
specifically
sets
forth.
that
is
a
rare,
rare
exception.
it
is
not
the
rule.
and
then
lastly,
when
we
have
the
entire
question
of
declaratory
judgment.
we
were
beyond
declaratory
judgment
at
that
point
on
a
civil
basis.
we
were
already
in
the
criminal
courts,
and
declaratory
judgment
is
that
there
may
well
be
a
controversy
between
individuals
that
can
be
resolved
by
means
of
this
method.
so
that
at
the
time
that
we
were
presented
with
process,
there
was
really
nothing
that
we
could
do
except
go
along
with
the
process,
fight
it
in
the
criminal
court,
raise
all
of
the
constitutional
questions,
and
then
discover
that
the
local
court
said,
if
it's
nude
dancing...
not
live
entertainment,
by
the
way...
if
it's
nude
dancing,
it's
not
protected
speech
at
all.
then
we
get
into
the
county
court,
which
is
an
appeal
but
called
a
trial
de
novo.
there
we
find
that
the
court
says,
well,
there
are
first
amendment
guarantees
involved
in
dancing,
but
they
don't
apply
in
this
case.
and
why
not?
we
were
never
told
why
they
don't
apply
here
at
all.
and
then
we
find
that
the
appellate
division
affirms
basically
for
the
opinion
of
the
judge
in
the
county
court,
but
without
any
elaboration
or
without
any
clarification.
the
supreme
court
refuses
our
petition
for
certification,
dismisses
our
appeal,
and
we
never
get
a
determination
on
the
issue
of
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
no,
i
didn't
say
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
i
say
it
could.
i'm
saying--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--it
could,
but
again
subject
to
challenge
as
to
the
basis
upon
which
there
is
this--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--and
if
they--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--and
if
they
did,
sir--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--no,
what
i've
said
is
that--
mr.
robert
e.
levy
--my
answer
with
respect
to
the
theater
was
that
if
they,
they
cannot
ban
a
theater
if
there
are
other
commercial
uses
without
being
subject
to
a
challenge.
that
could
be
a
first
amendment
challenge.
i
submit
that
there
can
be
an
attempt
to
ban
other
commercial
enterprise
which
is
not
protected
by
one
of
the
first
ten
amendments.
but
that
again,
that
type
of
banning
would
be
subject
to
some
form
of
review,
and
if
there
were
an
equivalent
use
in
terms
of
whatever
it
be,
traffic,
congregation
of
people,
littering,
whatever
it
is
that
may
be
their
concern,
if
there
is
a
comparable
use
that
is
being
allowed,
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
question,
either
equal
protection
of
the
law,
or
any
other
aspect
that
would
then
allow
them
to
make
that
distinction.
a
ration
would
have
to
come
from
them
as
to
why
there
is
that
distinction,
so
that
we
don't
have
gasoline
stations,
but
that
we
could
have
coalyards,
and
that
i
could
go
down
and
fill
up
my
car
with
coal
and
take
it
home
for
my
stove.
and
i
think
that
in
each
instance
there
is
power,
but
that
the
power
does
not
mean
that
there
is
then
a
necessity
for
an
abdication
of
objection
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
affected
by
it.
and
when
we
went
into
the
question
of
a
fundamental
right
where
there
is
first
amendment,
the
requirement
on
the
part
of
the
state
is
not
only
brought
to
bear
sooner
but
it's
a
deeper
problem
that
they
have.
this
court
has
put
it
on
the
basis
of
careful
scrutiny.
and
every
time
this
court
has
talked
of
careful
scrutiny,
it
has
basically
set
aside
any
presumptions
of
validity
in
terms
of
an
enactment.
it
does
not
cloak
it
with
the
presumption
of
validity
that
would
be
whether
or
not
a
fundamental
right.
and
i
think
the
two
cases
of
the
village
of
belle
terre
and
the
east
cleveland
case
seems
to
set
forth
what
the
attitude
of
this
court
has
been
in
the
past
relative
to
the
question
of
when
there
is
a
fundamental
right
and
when
there
is
not
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
well,
in
belle
terre
what
we
have
is,
there
was
an
attempt
to
pass
an
ordinance,
or
there
was
an
ordinance
passed,
setting
forth
that
there
would
be
an
allowance,
or
a
disallowance
of
family
and
friends,
but
that
would
keep
the
basic
family
unit
as
one
that
could
rent,
but
that
there
could
be
a
preventation
of
anyone
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
family.
and
it
was
set
forth
that
this
isn't
a
social
right.
the
family
itself
is
basically
something
that
is
recognized
by
the
courts
as
something
that
should
be
in
some
way
or
other
advanced
in
all
the
methods
possible.
and
therefore
the
statute
itself...
shall
i
finish?
mr.
robert
e.
levy
in
belle
terre
they
did
not
sustain.
they
sustained
the
prohibition
against
renting
in
terms
of
other
than
family.
the
court
recognized
as
a
fundamental
right
the
preservation
of
the
family
and
in
east
cleveland,
where
there
was
a
distinction
drawn
between
members
of
the
family.
they
created
degrees
of
family.
it
was
then
set
forth
that
that
would
violate
the
recognized
fundamental
right
and
therefore
there
was
no
presumption
of
validity
granted
to
the
ordinance
in
east
cleveland,
but
rather
with
careful
scrutiny
the
community
was
put
to
the
test
of
having
to
prove
what
it
is
that
was
its
purpose
in
distinguishing
between
cousins
because
of
the
consanguineous
situation.
mr.
robert
e.
levy
thank
you,
sir.
