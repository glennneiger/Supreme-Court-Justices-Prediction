justice
rehnquist
but
didn't
you
agree
that
a
community
could
zone
out
entirely
commercial
uses
and
make
it
entirely
residential?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
they
did
strictly
keep
it
to
all
commerce,
they
could
exclude
people
who
wanted
to
purvey
books,
movies
or
anything
else,
so
long
as
they
just
made
it
an
absolute
flat
ban.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
peepshow
is
more
a
matter
of
consumption
than
being
on
consignment
or
return
in
ten
days
and
you
get
your
money
back.
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
get
to
view
it
for
nothing,
do
you?
justice
rehnquist
would
you
also
agree
that
the
borough
of
mount
ephraim
is
entitled
to
prohibit,
say,
a
rock
concert
that
is
apt
to
draw
50,000
people
from
philadelphia
and
atlantic
city
because
of
the
congestion
problems
involved,
even
though
it
does
involve
live
entertainment?
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
it
also
precedes
the
song,
"new
york
throughway's
closed,
man.
