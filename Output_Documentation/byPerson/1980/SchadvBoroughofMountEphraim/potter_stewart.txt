justice
stewart
would
you
tell
us
a
little
more
about
mount
ephraim?
how's
it
zoned
and
so
on?
justice
stewart
commercial
or,
and
residential?
justice
stewart
and
what's
its
population?
justice
stewart
and
do
the
residents
live
and
work...
they're
living
there,
of
course.
do
they
work
in
the
community,
or
more
particularly,
do
they
commute
to
camden
and
philadelphia?
justice
stewart
except,
of
course,
for
your
client
and
others
similarly
situated,
who
run
commercial
establishments
in
the
community?
justice
stewart
employment,
there;
yes.
is
it
a
farming
community?
justice
stewart
but
not
now?
justice
stewart
the
ordinance
in
question
is
the
one
that
appears
on
page
3
of
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
stewart
all
right.
then
it's
99-15b,
b(1).
and
then
follows
by
saying
"all
uses
not
expressly
permitted
are
prohibited.
"
justice
stewart
and
i
suppose
"dinners"
means
"diners",
doesn't
it?
i
suppose
that
these
restaurants
can
serve
breakfast
and
lunch.
but,
for
example...
well,
let's
see.
i
don't
see
flower
stores,
for
example.
are
they
prohibited?
justice
stewart
well,
nurseries
is
here.
nurseries,
but
not
florists.
but
on
the
sixth
line
it
refers
to
"flowers".
i
suppose
that
would
cover
florists.
moving
picture
theaters?
are
they
here?
justice
stewart
are
newsstands
here?
justice
stewart
bookstores?
yes,
books
are.
justice
stewart
yes.
what
is
your
contention
that
is
defective
in
this
zoning
ordinance
or
in
this
conviction
of
your
client?
justice
stewart
of
course,
as
my
brother
white
earlier
said,
what
we
have
before
us
is
the
ordinance
as
construed
by
the
new
jersey
courts.
justice
stewart
and
the
ordinance
doesn't
even
seem
to
allow
moving
picture
theaters,
but
there
is
one
in
town,
we've
been
told.
justice
stewart
but
in
any
event,
we've
been
told
that
whatever
this
ordinance
may
seem
on
its
face
to
say,
what
it
does
do
is
permit
moving
pictures
and
an
adult
bookstore
but
not
live
entertainment.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stewart
and
therefore
that's
the
ordinance
as
it
comes
to
us,
just
as
though
it
were
written
in
so
many
words,
in
the
ordinance.
justice
stewart
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
reasoning
of
judge
deighan,
which
is
the
only
full
dress
opinion
we
seem
to
have
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
well,
flowers
are
mentioned,
as
was
brought
to
my
attention.
justice
stewart
then
it
says,
all
uses
not
expressly
permitted
are
prohibited.
