well,
it
is
true
that
a
duty
could
exist
to
every
single
member
of
the
public.
that's
just
another
way
of
saying
it.
that's
true
of
maritime
law
or
land-based
tort
law.
justice
stewart
regardless
of
any
special
relationship,
just
there's
a
duty
to
every
member
of
the
public
to
not
injure
that
person
negligently.
justice
stewart
or
with
fault,
to
use
the
admiralty
wording.
justice
stewart
no,
except
most
of
the
cases
are
seaworthiness
cases,
because
from
the
plaintiff's
point
of
view,
seaworthiness,
unseaworthiness
is
much
easier
to
prove
than
negligence.
justice
stewart
so
you
could
always
go
with
unseaworthiness,
if
you
were
a
plaintiff's
lawyer.
justice
stewart
that
language
that
my
brother
brennan
has
read
says
nothing
of
liability
to
anybody
else.
it's
just
his
responsibility
to
do
it.
justice
stewart
that's
the
difference
between
unseaworthiness
and
negligence;
yes.
