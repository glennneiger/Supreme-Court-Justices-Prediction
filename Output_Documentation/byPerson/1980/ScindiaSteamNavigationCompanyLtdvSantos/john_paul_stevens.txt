justice
stevens
mr.
staring,
what
in
your
view,
what
was
the
duty
of
the
vessel
owner
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
the
winch?
did
he
have
any
duty
to
the
longshoreman
and
if
so,
what
was
it?
justice
stevens
no
duty
whatsoever,
even
if
the
winch
were
defective,
he
knew
it
was
defective,
he
knew
it
was
dangerous,
he
knew
that
people
would
be
working
with
it.
justice
stevens
and
i'm
saying,
what
the
duty
is,
not
what
the
facts
show.
justice
stevens
superior
to
whom?
justice
stevens
supposing
they
have
equal
knowledge.
if
they
both
know
it's
defective?
is
there
any
duty
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
secretary
of
labor's
requirement
that
defects
in
the
winch
be
reported
to
the
vessel
owner?
why
do
they
have
that
requirement,
then?
justice
stevens
then
he
has
the
duty
to
repair,
right?
justice
stevens
no
duty?
justice
stevens
maybe
the
stevedore
hasn't.
maybe
the
stevedore
says,
the
winch
seems
to
be
acting
up
a
little
bit.
i
don't
know
much
about
this
particular
winch,
but
it
looks
fishy
to
me.
and
what
does
the
vessel
owner
have
to
do
then?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i
want
to
ask
about
duty.
does
he
have
any
duty?
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
you
say
he
has
a
duty,
then
you've
got
sieracki
right
back.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
when
you
say
"superior
knowledge",
superior
to
whom,
to
the
stevedore
or
the
longshoreman?
justice
stevens
because
the
restatement
talks
about
the
invitee
who's
injured.
justice
stevens
i
know
you're
not
relying
on
the
restatement,
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
quite
a
difference,
whether
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
boss
or
the
employee.
superior
to
the
plaintiff,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
stevens
crew
other
than
the
plaintiff,
the
man
running
the
winch
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
plaintiff
himself
doesn't
have
any
knowledge
whatsoever?
is
he
somehow...
the
knowledge
of
his
employer
imputed
to
him?
justice
stevens
i'm
sure
it's
possible
if
they'd
enter
into
an
agreement
that
the
stevedore
would
assume
all
risk
of
liability,
he
could
do
that.
justice
stevens
there's
a
difference
between
proving
negligence
and
proving
under...
what
was
the
doctrine
before?
unseaworthiness,
there's
difference
between
negligence
and
unseaworthiness,
isn't
there?
justice
stevens
mr.
grutz,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
meaning
as
applied
to
this
particular
case?
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
that
there
has
to
be
evidence
beyond
evidence
that
the
winch
was
defective?
in
other
words,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
evidence
of
notice
to
the
shipowner?
justice
stevens
so
that
you
would
not
contend
that
you
are
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
merely
by
proving
a
defect
in
the
the
winch?
justice
stevens
and
what
in
this
record
is
there
to
indicate
that
the
vessel
owner
had
any
notice
of
the
defective
winch?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
stevedore
was
running
it
for
more
than
2-1/2
days.
justice
stevens
is
this
true,
the
stevedore
had
been
on
the
job
more
than
2-1/2
days?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
still
puzzled.
do
you
have
to
prove
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
before
the
stevedore
went
on
the
job?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
how
does
the
2-1/2
day
testimony
tend
to
prove
that
the
vessel
owner
knew
anything?
justice
stevens
well,
the
test
is
whether
he
had
reason
to
know,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
i'm
still
puzzled.
i
hate
to
reveal
my
ignorance
about
this
question
of
notice
to
the
vessel
owner.
and,
as
justice
powell
pointed
out,
it's
not
like
a
store
where
you're
in
a
public
area.
does
the
record
tell
us...
and,
again,
maybe
i
should
know
this...
whether
personnel,
rather,
employees
of
the
vessel
owner
were
regularly
aboard
the
ship
during
the
loading
operation?
justice
stevens
and
the
various
people
who
testified,
as
i
understand
it,
are
all
longshoremen?
justice
stevens
i
see,
were
back
and
forth,
on
and
off?
justice
stevens
in
places
where
they
would
have
seen
the
winch,
is
that
the
theory
that?
justice
stevens
it
isn't
as
though
it
was
a
fully
manned
vessel
with
a
lot
of
people
representing
the
vessel,
is
it?
justice
stevens
but...
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you
right
there?
as
i
understood
your
opening
argument,
you
did
not
buy
100
percent
the
restatement's
formulation
of
the
standard
of
duty.
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
to?
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
written
materials
that
tells
us
precisely
what
your
position
is?
justice
stevens
because
i
sort
of
had
the
view
you
were
adopting
the
restatement
position.
