justice
jr.
now,
mr.
staring,
where
is
it
in
the
statute
you
said
supports
this
interpretation?
justice
jr.
this
being
the
duties
you
read
us.
i
thought
you
said
those
were
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
labor?
justice
jr.
and
we
don't
find
this
in
the
'72
amendments,
we
find
it
in
these
regulations
issued
under
the
older
statute?
justice
jr.
mr.
staring,
incidentally,
on
the
issue
of
superior
knowledge,
does
the
shipowner
before
he
turns
ships'
equipment
over
to
a
stevedoring
company,
have
any
duty
of
inspection
of
the
equipment,
to
find
out
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
it?
justice
jr.
unless
he
happens
to
stumble
on
knowledge
of
the
defect,
he
has
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
duty
to
say
a
word
to
the
stevedore
about
it?
does
he?
justice
jr.
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
which--
justice
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
duty
of
the
shipowner?
was
there
a
uniform
national
federal
standard?
justice
jr.
what
was
that?
justice
jr.
well,
specifically
as
to
duty?
justice
jr.
well,
what
i
was
asking,
mr.
grutz,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
addresses
itself
specifically
to
the
duty
of
the
shipowner
to
the
longshoreman?
justice
jr.
well,
what
does
it
say?
justice
jr.
well,
what's
the
previous
sentence
mean,
mr.
grutz?
justice
jr.
"will
still
be
required
to
exercise
the
same
care
as
landbased
person
in
providing
a
safe
place
to
work.
"
justice
jr.
well,
i
must
say,
mr.
grutz,
that
at
page
i-10:
"nothing
in
this
bill
is
intended
to
derogate
from
the
vessel's
responsibility
to
take
appropriate
corrective
action
where
it
knows
or
should
have
known
about
a
dangerous
condition.
"
seems
to
be
contrary
to
the
argument
of
your
colleague,
that
all
they
have
to
do
is,
if
he
knows
about
something,
tell
the
stevedore
about
it?
justice
jr.
no,
the
next
paragraph
illustrates
what
it--
justice
jr.
--it
talks
about
a
longshoreman
who
slips
on
an
oil
spill
on
a
vessel's
deck.
justice
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
rely
on
what
they
said
on
i-11:
"under
this
standard"...
that
is,
the
negligence
standard...
"as
adopted
by
the
committee,
there
will
of
course
be
disputes
as
to
whether
the
vessel
was
negligent
in
a
particular
case.
"
"such
issues
can
only
be
resolved
through
the
application
of
accepted
principles
of
tort
law
and
of
the
ordinary
process
of
litigation,
just
as
they
are
in
cases
involving
alleged
negligence
by
landbased
third
parties.
"
justice
jr.
if
the
condition
existed
for
2-1/2
days
wouldn't
that
create
a
jury
question?
whether
or
not
he
has
reason
to
know?
justice
jr.
it's
the
ordinary
negligence
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
if
you
slip
on
something
in
the
department
store,
that's
all
you
have
to
prove,
that
it
was
there
long
enough
that
he
should
have
known
about
it.
justice
jr.
they
might
have
been
oil
spill
examples
in
department
stores.
justice
jr.
and,
in
that
sense,
the
landbased
rule
and
this
rule
would
be
the
same.
justice
jr.
well,
as
a
state
court
judge
for
a
lot
of
years,
i
had
a
number
of
them.
justice
jr.
well,
i
suppose,
in
federal
employer
liability
cases,
in
jones
act
cases,
we
have
a
single
federal
standard
of
negligence,
don't
we?
justice
jr.
and
that
hasn't
been
affected
by
any
state
law
changes
in
the
negligence
standards,
if
there
have
been
any.
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
argument
would
be,
if
we
can
have
it
under
those
two
statutes,
surely
we
can
have
a
uniform
federal
standard
here.
justice
jr.
why
visit
that
responsibility
on
the
injured
longshoreman?
