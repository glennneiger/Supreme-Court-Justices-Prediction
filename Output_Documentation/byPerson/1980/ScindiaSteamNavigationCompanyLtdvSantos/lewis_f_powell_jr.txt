justice
jr.
mr.
grutz,
it's
agreed
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
stevedore
had
control
of
the
workplace.
is
that
correct?
justice
jr.
it
says,
"and
particularly
the
foreman,
hatchtender
and
winchdriver.
"
--oh,
the
stevedore
"through
its
employees,
and
particularly.
"
those
employees,
"was
in
control
of
the
loading
at
the
no.
3
hatch
on
the
evening
of
plaintiff's
accident.
"
justice
jr.
is
it
clear
that
they
were
not
in
control
of
the
winch?
justice
jr.
as
to
whatever
the
stevedore
had
control,
the
analogy
of
a
storeowner
would
be
incomplete,
would
it
not?
justice
jr.
you
discussed
at
one
point
a
little
earlier
in
the
argument
the
possible
analogy
of
a
landbased
store
owner
for,
say,
a
grease
spot
on
the
floor,
but
in
this
case,
to
the
extent
that
the
stevedore
company
controlled
the
workplace,
that
would
be
different
from
a
store,
where
the
storeowner
himself
controlled
the
workplace.
