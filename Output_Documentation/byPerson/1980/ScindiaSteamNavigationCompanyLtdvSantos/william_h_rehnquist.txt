justice
rehnquist
well,
another
purpose
was
to
get
rid
of
a
sieracki-type
cause
of
action,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
even
simple
negligence
traditionally
outlined
in
terms
of
duty
and
breach
of
duty
owed
to
a
particular
person
or
group
of
persons?

rehnquist
driving
an
automobile.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
shipowner
and
the
employee
had
equal
knowledge?
do
you
say
that...
do
you
concede
that
the
stevedore
can
recover
from
the
shipowner?
justice
rehnquist
the
longshoreman.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
statute
in
'72
said
that
it
wanted
to
go
to
landbased
principles
of
negligence
rather
than
maritime
law?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
grutz,
if
we
apply
landbased
principles
of
negligence
in
this
area
as
set
out
in
the
restatement
or
in
some
other
treatise
or
some
other
line
of
cases,
do
you
lose
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say,
congress
has
in
effect
given
us
no
guidance
and
we've
simply
got
to
choose
from
among
the
various
courts
of
appeals,
or--
justice
rehnquist
from
this
court?
justice
rehnquist
that
was
just
a
refusal
to
overrule
sieracki,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
where
does
one
find
this
in
the...
is
it
in
that
committee
report,
or?
justice
rehnquist
is
it
a
joint
house-senate
report?
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
not
in
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
would
be
the
difference
if
the
shipowner
has
an
obligation
to
provide
a
safe
place
to
work
and
sieracki
is
done
away
with?
justice
rehnquist
and
to
whom
must
the
notice
run?
to
the--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
on
the
other
side,
to
the
stevedore
employer
or
to
the
actual
longshoreman?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
notice
of
the
unsafe
condition.
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
plaintiff
knew
there
was
an
open
and
obvious
danger,
why
shouldn't
he
have
been
barred?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
could
just
as
well
be
a
fellow
servant
or
a
failure
to
submit
sufficient
proof
to
the
district
court.
justice
rehnquist
why
didn't
congress
put
this
in
the
statute
rather
than
leaving
it
all
to
a
joint
congressional
committee
report
if
it
was
this
critical?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
that's
certainly
a
rejection
of
the
landowner-invitee
landbased
test.
justice
rehnquist
but
several
circuits
have
adopted
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles
under
the
statute,
maybe.
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
there
is
any
landbased
element
or
component
to
this
new
standard
laid
down
in
1972
or
preserved
in
1972,
as
you
say,
would
you
say
it
changes
as
state
law
changes,
or
is
it
fixed
as
of
1972?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
it
doesn't?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
court--
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of
any
number
of
possible
negligence
tests.
they
may
differ
now
or
they
may
change
in
the
future.
justice
rehnquist
the
finding
here
was
that
the
stevedore
had
control
of
the
loading
at
the
no.

justice
rehnquist
well,
the
longshoreman
wants
the
money.
