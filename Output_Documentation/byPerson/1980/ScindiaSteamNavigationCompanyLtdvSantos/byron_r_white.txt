justice
white
let's
suppose,
when
the
job
starts,
they
hire
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
says,
by
the
way,
this
winch
is
acting
up
a
little,
but
i
think
if
you're
really
careful
with
it,
it'll
be
all
right.
and
the
stevedore
says,
well,
i'll
watch
it.
and
it
does
what
it
did
in
this
case.
now,
all
the
shipowner's
done
is
to
point
out
a
piece
of
defective
machinery
and
the
stevedore
says,
well,
we'll
go
ahead
anyway,
in
effect.
he
goes
ahead
and
somebody
gets
hurt.
justice
white
so
you...
the
short
answer
is
that
the
extent
of
his
duty
is
to
make
known
any
unsafe
things
that
are
known
to
him,
the
shipowner,
that
is?
justice
white
and
that
he
has
no
affirmative
duty
to
repair
the
winch?
justice
white
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
longshoreman?
justice
white
so
in
my
example
to
you
you
would
say,
is
that
the
stevedore,
if
he
didn't
like
it,
he
didn't
want
to
work
with
it,
if
his
judgment
was
that
the
winch
was
unsafe
or
that
he
didn't
want
to
take
the
risk,
that
he
would
just
not
work.
he'd
say,
either
fix
it
or
get
another
stevedore.
justice
white
do
you
think
that's
what
the
restatement
standard
means?
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
rejected
the
landbased
restatement
standard,
duty
of
the
landowner.
and
didn't
you
urge
that
that
should
govern
or
not?
justice
white
did
you
in
the
court
of
appeals
urge
that?
justice
white
but
was
it
urged?
justice
white
and
do
you
agree
that
it's--
justice
white
--well,
i'm
wondering,
because
the
last
part
of
that
standard
says,
with
regard
to
the
landowner,
"he
should
realize
that
it
involves
an
unreasonable
risk
of
harm
and
fails
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
protect
the
invitees
against
the
danger.
"
now,
you
say
all
he
has
to
do
to
protect
the
invitees
against
the
danger
is
to
tell
them
about
it.
justice
white
well,
in
this
case,
for
example,
all
he
would
have
to
do
is
tell
them
about
the--
justice
white
--a
fortiori,
in
this
case,
if
he
didn't
know
about
it
in
advance
but
suppose
the
stevedore
told
him
that,
gee,
you've
got
a
defective
crane
here,
and
he
just
shrugged
his
shoulders.
it's
the
same
thing.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
just...
i
should
know
this.
in
an
ordinary
negligence
action,
if
there
is
such
a
thing,
by
a
longshoreman
against
a
shipowner
claiming
negligence,
is
the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
available
to
the
shipowner?
justice
white
or
to
anyone
else?
and
the
same
with
respect
to
contributory
negligence.
except
to
say
they
divide...
it's
comparative
fault?
justice
white
except
for
that?
justice
white
and
part
of
the
argument
here
is
that
the
ali
standard
really
recognizes
assumption
of
risk.
justice
white
i'm
sure
it
isn't.
justice
white
--but
it
doesn't
say
what
the
extent
of
the
duty
of
the
shipowner
is,
though.
justice
white
that's
the
argument.
justice
white
well,
it
must
have
been
before--
justice
white
--weren't
most
cases
on
the
seaworthiness
basis?
justice
white
well,
where
do
you
get
much
law
about
negligence
before
'72?
justice
white
it
was
between
the
shipowner
and
the
longshoremen.
justice
white
well,
it
sounds
like
the
committee
at
least
thought
that
under
ordinary
landbased
law,
the
injured
longshoreman
would
recover
on
this
oil
spill
matter.
justice
white
they
may
have
been
wrong
about
what
they
thought
landbased
law
was.
justice
white
or
thought
it
was.
justice
white
you
seem
to
think
that
that
would
be
enough
under
landbased
law
to
warn
him.
justice
white
you
say,
the
regular
landbased
rule
is
inconsistent
with
your
submission.
justice
white
with
your
submission
and
with--
justice
white
--even
though
this
committee
report
keeps
referring
to
landbased
standards.
justice
white
--don't
all
the
courts
of
appeals
agree
that
the
statute
intended
a
uniform
test?
justice
white
why
shouldn't
he
have
quit
work?
justice
white
well,
but
you
just
gave
me
the
answer
that
he
should
have
quit
work.
justice
white
and
if
he'd
have
quit
work,
the
longshoreman
wouldn't
have
been
working.
if
the
stevedore
had
said,
we've
got
a
bad
winch
here,
i've
got
to
tell
the
shipowner
and
wait
till
he
fixes
it,
because
i
have
no
right
to
fix
it.
justice
white
so,
what's...
shouldn't
it
also
be
open
to
question
as
to
whether
the
stevedore
has
the
duty,
as
soon
as
reasonably
possible,
to
notify
a
shipowner
about
a
defective
winch?
why
should
it
be
left
to,
"should
have
known"?
couldn't
the
stevedore
have
told
him,
as
soon
as
he
knew
the
winch
was
defective?
he
knew
it
for
2-1/2
days.
justice
white
well,
what
if
there
was
something
that...
what
if
this
had
gone
on
for
a
week?
you'll
just
say,
well,
there's
all
the
more
reason
for
the
shipowner
knowing
it?
justice
white
you
don't
think
there's
ever...
it
never
should
make
a
difference
if
the
stevedore
didn't
give
notice
to
the
shipowner
about
the
defect?
justice
white
even
though
the
longshoreman
is
covered
by
the
work-pay
compensation
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
is
scindia
steam
navigation
company
against
santos.
here,
santos,
a
longshoreman,
was
injured
while
he
was
loading
sacks
of
wheat
into
the
hold
of
petitioner's
vessel.
he
sued
the
--
the
shipowner
claiming
that
his
injury
was
due
to
the
ship's
defective
crane
and
winch.
his
assertion
was
that
the
shipowner
had
negligently
permitted
the
longshoreman
to
use
the
crane.
the
suit
was
brought
under
section
905
(b)
of
title
33
of
the
united
states
code
which
was
enacted
1972
and
which
specifically
permits
an
injured
longshoreman
to
recover
damages
from
the
shipowner
if
he
can
prove
his
injuries
were
caused
by
the
shipowner's
negligence.
the
section
905
(b),
however,
didn't
define
negligence
and
it
has
been
left
largely
to
the
courts
to
spill
out
the
standard
care
that
shipowner
must
satisfy
in
the
enumerable
circumstances
in
which
negligence
may
be
claimed.
the
lower
federal
courts
have
been
in
somewhat
state
of
disarray
to
have
it
construe
and
apply
section
905
(b).
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
shipowner,
an
action
which
perhaps
have
been
quite
proper
if
its
view
of
a
--
it's
a
trial
judge's
view
of
section
905
(b)
had
been
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
it
wasn't
and
set
aside
the
judgment
and
ordered
the
case
to
go
to
trial.
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
--
the
ninth
circuit.
we
agree
that
summary
judgment
was
improper
in
this
case.
we
have
filed
an
opinion
however,
which
differs
substantially
from
the
views
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
how
section
905
(b)
should
be
construed
and
applied.
the
court
is
unanimous
except
that
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
also,
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined.
justice
powell
also
has
concurred
and
his
opinion
is
joined
by
justice
rehnquist.
