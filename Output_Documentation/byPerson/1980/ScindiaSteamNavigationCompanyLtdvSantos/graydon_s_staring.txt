mr.
graydon
s.
staring
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
to
the
court
one
of
the
four
principal
purposes
for
which
the
1972
amendments
to
the
longshoremen's
act
were
made,
according
to
the
senate
committee
report,
and
that
purpose,
as
the
report
stated
it,
was
to
provide
a
special
cause
of
action
for
damages
against
third
parties.
the
court
below,
and
the
respondent
here--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
i
was
simply
quoting
from
the
four
stated
purposes,
stated
principal
purposes
in
the
senate
report,
and
i
think
that
probably
that
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
sieracki
was
subsumed
in
that
statement
in
this
purpose,
to
provide
a
new
or
specified
cause
of
action.
i
quite
agree
that
that
was
the
intent.
very
much
a
part
of
it.
the
court
below,
and
the
respondent
here
in
defining
that
specified
cause
of
action
would,
we
submit,
impose
upon
the
vessel
a
responsibility
for
longshoremen's
injury
which
is
without
counterpart
in
any
significant
body
of
law,
and
let
me
explain
it.
first,
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
of
the
relations
involved.
the
longshoreman
here,
as
in
most
such
cases,
was
not
an
employee
of
the
shipowner,
and
thus
the
shipowner
was
not
by
virtue
of
that
relationship
under
those
special
duties
of
care
which
employers
traditionally
have
toward
their
direct
employees.
the
longshoreman
was,
instead,
as
usual,
an
employee
of
an
expert
independent
stevedoring
company.
this
court
in
italia,
some
years
ago,
noted
that
such
companies
are
usually
in
the
best
position
to
enforce
safety
for
their
employees.
this
is
because
the
stevedore
contractor
is
in
practical
control
of
the
area
that's
been
turned
over
to
him,
is
in
control
of
the
operations
he's
conducting
there,
and
of
the
men
who
are
doing
it.
but
more
than
that,
the
stevedore
contractor
here
as
in
other
cases
has
imposed
upon
him
by
positive
law
under
section
41
of
the
longshoremen's
act
and
the
numerous
regulations
which
are
issued
by
the
department
of
labor,
a
primary
and
very
positive
duty
of
care
for
the
safety
of
his
employees
in
the
work.
and
before
we
get
farther
into
this
case,
let
me
point
to
the
specific
regulation
which
bears
most
sharply
on
this
case.
there
is,
or
was
at
the
time
of
this
case,
as
there
still
is,
a
regulation
issued
by
the
department
of
labor
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
that
any
defect
or
malfunction
of
a
winch
be
reported
immediately
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
vessel.
but
what
is
much
more,
the
regulation
goes
on
and
says
that
in
the
case
of
an
electrical
winch,
when
the
electromagnetic
or
other
service
brake
is
unable
to
hold
the
load,
as
is
alleged
in
this
case,
the
winch
shall
not
be
used.
and
thus
the
stevedore
contractor
was
confronted
with
positive
law
commanding
him
to
report
immediately
and
not
to
use
the
winch
if
that
defect
manifested
itself.
against
that
background,
then,
we
ask
what
was
the
duty
of
the
vessel
owner?
the
respondent
here
in
his
brief
says
that
the
essential
question
is
not
one
of
duty
but
whether
his
"interests
are
entitled
to
be
protected
against
the
defendant's
conduct.
"
and
to
that
we
ask
rhetorically,
what
conduct?
because
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
this
field
between
conduct
and--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--i
think
that
is...
yes,
i
do
think
that
is
very
common,
and
i
think
that
in
any
ordinary
negligence
case
one
must
first
find
the
duty
based
upon
some
status
or
relationship
which
imposes
upon
the
defendant
an
obligation
to
look
out
for
another.
now,
in
some
instances,
the
status
or
relationship
is
simply
proximity,
such
as
my
proximity
to
another
man
which
puts
me
in
a
position
to
hurt
him.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that
has
not
been
the
traditional
maritime
law,
no,
sir.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
well,
i
think
i
must
agree
that
such
a
duty
can
exist;
yes.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes.
but
negligence,
again--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--a
duty
not
to
conduct
ourselves
in
a
way
which
carelessly
or
recklessly
endangers
those
about
us;
yes.
i
quite
agree
with
that.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
if
the
condition
of
the
winch...
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
do
not
think
that
the
vessel
owner
had
any
duty
to
the
longshoreman
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
winch.
i
would--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--ah,
now--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--all
right.
the
vessel
owner
has
no
duty,
i
submit,
with
respect
to
the
condition
of
the
winch
unless
he
was
in
a
position
of
superior
knowledge
or
superior
means
of
preventing
harm.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
superior
knowledge.
if,
therefore,
he
was
as--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--superior
to
the
stevedore
company.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
think
he
has
none.
i
think
that
in
that
situation
i
would
pose
the
question
whether
the
shipowner
cannot
reasonably
hire
a
stevedore
who
is
subject
to
the
legal
mandate
that
i've
described
and
look
to
the
stevedore
to
see
that
his
longshoremen
are
not
subjected
to
the
danger.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
in
order
that
the
vessel
owner
can
then
make
repairs
if
repairs
should
be
made.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
well,
he
doesn't
have
a
duty
as
such,
he
has
an
opportunity.
he
has
an
opportunity
to
repair.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
since
the
stevedore,
if
he
has
obeyed
the
regulation,
has
stopped
work,
it's
a
question
whether
the
shipowner's
duties--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--the
vessel
owner
then
has,
i
would
say,
an
opportunity
to
repair
it
and
certainly--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--i
beg...
your
honor.
i
agree.
he
has
a
duty.
in
certain
circumstances--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
he
has
a
duty,
then,
to
look
into
the
condition
of
the
winch
and
exercise
due
care
with
respect
to
whether
it
is
operating
properly
before
the
stevedore
goes
forward
and
works
with
it
further.
but
he
does
not
have
an
absolute
duty
as
under
sieracki
to
see
if
that
winch
is
free
of
defect.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no.
your
honor,
is
your
honor
using
the
term
stevedore
here
to
mean
the
longshoreman?
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
if
the
knowledge
is
equal,
then
we
do
not
concede
that
a
recovery
can
be
had
from
the
vessel.
let
me--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--what
has
happened,
your
honor,
in
that
case,
is
that
the
vessel
owner
has
pointed
out
a
report
of,
let
us
say,
a
winch
that
operates
less
than
perfectly.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
a
defect
or
not,
but
it
doesn't...
maybe
not
be
operating
perfectly.
and
the
stevedore,
who
is
an
expert
in
this
field
and
in
the
matter
of
safety
for
his
employees
in
this
field,
is
then
asked
to
consider
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
safe
operating
winch.
and
he
may
be
looked
to,
we
submit,
to
make
that
determination.
and
if
he
thinks--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
he
has
no
affirmative
duty
in
that
circumstance
to
repair
the
winch
for
the
benefit
of
the
stevedore
and
the
longshoreman.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that's
right.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
statute
that
i
point
to
is
not
in
the
amendments,
your
honor,
but
is
section
41
of
the
longshoremen's
act,
which
has
been
there
somewhat
more
years
than
the
1972
amendments.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
your
honor,
the
statute
is
the
general
direction
and
the
authority
for
the
regulations,
and
then
regulations
have
been
issued
under
that
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
respondent,
here,
of
course,
says
no
to
the
question
whether
the
vessel
owner
may
look
to
the
stevedore
in
the
circumstances
which
we
have
just
been
discussing;
and
we
say,
seeks
to
impose
on
the
vessel
a
novel
responsibility,
one
which
if
accepted
would
be
peculiar
to
the
maritime
law.
and
so
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
that
counsels
us
that
under
section
5
of
the
act,
as
amended,
landbased
law
is
to
be
applied,
and
we
are
to
reject...
and
i
quote
here,
"reject
any
theory
of
liability,
and
specifically
to
reject
any
nondelegable
duty
of
a
shipowner.
"
i'd
like
to
address
for
just
a
moment
the
meaning
of
this
term,
"nondelegable
duty"
and
what
might
be
meant
by
its
absence,
once
it's
rejected.
we
don't
ordinarily
delegate
duties.
we
delegate
powers
and
we
delegate
functions,
and
what
in
context
this
term
means
is
a
duty
which
someone
is
required
to
retain
after
he
has
delegated
by
contract
the
function
which
is
related
to
it.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
the
maritime
industry,
and
the
longshoremen's
act,
what
congress
meant
here
when
they
rejected
the
nondelegable
duty
was
to
insure
that
a
shipowner
hereafter
would
have
the
capacity
to
contract
work
out
free
of
a
retained
duty
to
oversee
that
work,
to
protect
workmen
involved
from
the
consequences
of
the
work.
now,
provided,
of
course,
that
the
shipowner
has
truly
delegated
the
work,
turned
over
the
control
of
it,
which
of
course
means
that
he
must
have
disclosed
what
he
had
superior
knowledge
of
or
made
available
the
superior
means
which
he
might
have
had.
because
if
he
has
not
done
that,
he
has
not
fully
delegated.
but
surely
congress
intended,
if
nondelegable
duty
means
anything,
that
the
shipowner
was
in
the
future
to
be
in
the
position
of
contracting
work
out
with
those
consequences--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--oh,
he
would
say,
fix
it,
and
he
would
go
on
standby
and
collect
his
charges
for
doing
nothing
until
you
have.
and...
or
until
you've
got
another
stevedore.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
do
urge--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--i
did
not
handle
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
at
this...
it
was
urged
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
i
agree
that
that
would
be
a
good
standard
to
apply.
but
may
i
say,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--your
honor,
if
he
should,
in
many
instances
that's
what--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--if
he
had
known
about
it
in
advance.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
stevedore
knows
it
and
is
asserted
to
have
known
it
throughout
the
record
and
did
not
stop
work,
as
he
was
commanded
by
law
to
do,
and
it
would
do
no
good
to
tell
him.
we
have
no
record,
and
the
judge
below
had
no
record
to
indicate
that
the
vessel
knew
this
in
advance
of
the
stevedore,
and
it
didn't
matter,
because
the
stevedore
knew
it
well
in
advance
of
the
accident.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
none
has
been
established
by
law,
none
is
shown
in
the
record
of
this
case.
there
is
no
general
legal
duty
of
inspecting
the
premises,
inspecting
the
equipments
other
than
what
is
imposed
by
coast
guard
and
other
applicable
regulations.
but
they
do
not
enter
the
record
here.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that
is
generally
correct.
he
has
no
way
to
do
this,
but
he
engages
the
stevedore
as
was
cited
in
the
hugev
case
as
an
expert
in
the
field
who
knows
that
he
meets
vessels
that
come
in
in
all
kinds
of
conditions
and
for
all
sorts...
because
of
all
sorts
of
stresses,
and
may
encounter
many
of
these
things
as
familiar
conditions.
i'd
like
to
dilate
a
little
bit
more
on
this
distinction
between
latent
and
obvious
or
known
defects
which
you
are
focusing
on.
this
is
very
much
at
the
heart
of
the
contention
here
that
the
doctrine
of
assumption
of
risk
is
somehow
involved.
the
key
to
the
question
is
the
validity
of
the
distinction
between
latency
and
knowledge
or
obviousness.
this
court,
years
after
it
had
disposed
of
the
question
of
assumption
of
risk
in
the
maritime
law,
has
continued
to
recognize
in
its
jurisprudence
the
distinction
between
latency
and
knowledge
and
the
significance
of
those
facts.
in
weyerhaeuser
v.
nacirema
in
1958,
the
court
noted
the
significance
of
latency
as
giving
rise
to
a
need
to
warn,
and
by
implication
in
contrast,
to
a
known,
obvious
condition.
the
following
year,
1959,
in
west
v.
united
states,
this
court
observed
the
same
distinction
again.
in
1969,
this
court
decided
federal
marine
terminals
v.
burnside,
and
in
that
case
quoted
in
full
the
portions
from
the
hugev
case
in
the
9th
circuit
and
the
mickle
case,
which
we
have
relied
on
and
quoted
in
our
briefs...
quoted
them,
i
venture
to
say,
with
at
least
a
modicum
of
approval.
and
those
sections
of
those
quotations
were
explicit
on
the
distinction
between
latency
and
knowledge
obviousness.
this
case
quoted
them
in
close
conjunction
with
citation
and
quotation,
and
indeed
application
of
its
kermarec
case,
which
has
also
been
urged
here
by
the
respondent,
and
incorrectly,
we
think,
as
a
reason
why
our
formulation
cannot
be
applied.
let
me
come
back
for
a
moment
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
white
focused
on
which
concerned
the
343
and
343(a).
we
do
not
embrace
343
and
343(a),
precisely
because
they
have
been
embraced
somewhere
and
rejected
somewhere.
when
the
state
court
cases
which
form
the
body
of
law
from
which
these
rules
must
be
drawn
are
examined,
we
find,
of
course,
that
some
of
them
deal
with
real
property,
some
of
them
deal
with
other
matters.
the
restatement
synthesizes
them
and
formulates
their
rules,
and
if
we
choose
to
use
the
restatement,
as
a
number
of
courts
below
have
done,
we
still
have
choices
within
the
restatement.
but
the
result
doesn't
make
much
difference,
or
any
at
all.
whether
you
choose
from
the
restatement
those
sections
which
have
to
do
with
real
property
and
analogize
the
vessel
to
real
property,
or
choose
sections
which
relate
to
chattels,
since
the
vessel
is
in
law
and
in
fact
a
chattel,
the
result
comes
out
the
same
way,
because
the
principle
is
the
same,
and
it's
expressed
in
both
sections,
that
the
vessel
is
only
liable
in
those
case.
the
occupier,
the
furnisher
of
the
chattel,
the
vessel
is
only
liable
on
the
basis
of
superior
knowledge,
means,
and
control.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
superior
to
the
stevedore.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
difficulty
about
the
restatement
formulation
is
this:
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--i
don't
just
mean
superior
to
the
plaintiff.
i
do
mean
superior
to
the
stevedore
and
his
crew.
let
me
say
this
about--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--all
of
them,
including
the
plaintiff.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
the
employer...
the
question
of...
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
you
are
going
to
abolish
nondelegable
duty,
it
has
to
be
possible
to
delegate
to
a
contractor
as
one
can
under
the
great
body
of
state
land
law
the
responsibility
for
protecting
your
employees
from
dangers
of
this
sort
by
inspecting,
examining,
supervising,
and
stopping
them
from
doing
unsafe
things.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
but
if
the
shipowner
is
going
to
continue
then
to
have
a
direct
duty
of
care
for
all
these
longshore
employees
exactly
as
though
they
were
his
employees
and
his
seamen,
his
duty
having
by
this
act
been
restricted
only
as
it
pertains
to
that
person
or
that
corporation
called
the
stevedore,
then
this
change
in
the
law
was
a
very,
very
hollow
change
indeed.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
there
is,
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
shipowner
does
not
have
a
duty
to
oversee
to
prevent
the
consequences
of
known
and
obvious
conditions
which
are
known
to
or
obvious
to
the
employee.
but
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
the
restatement
speaks
only
bilaterally.
and
that's
one
of
the
shortcomings
of
its
sections.
even
343,
343(a)
are
inadequate,
as
judge
friendly
has
pointed
out
somewhere;
they
set
too
liberal
a
standard,
because
they
don't
take
into
account
the
existence
of
an
intermediary
who
is
an
expert
stevedore
contractor
specially
charged
with
the
function
of
safety
by
law
and
by
contract.
they
don't
take
that
into
account.
and
they
deal
with
the
individual
invitee,
the
individual
person,
always,
coming
on
board
without
anybody
else
to
protect
his
interests
except
the
furnisher
of
the
chattel,
except
the
furnisher
of
the
premises.
and
in
the
case
we
deal
with,
we
deal
with
something
that
the
restatement
doesn't
contemplate
at
all,
which
is
the
special
circumstance
of
the
existence
of
this
expert
contractor
charged
by
law
with
a
program
of
safety.
i
should
like
to
say--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--the
defense
of
assumption
of
risk
is
not
generally
available
in
maritime
law
to
a
shipowner
or
to
anyone
else.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes,
sir.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes,
sir.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
except
that
it
wants
to
preserve
the
elimination
of
the
bar
of
assumption
of
risk,
and
the
bar
of
contributory
negligence.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
that's
not
my
argument.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
but
the
argument
is
made
and
we
think
it
is
fallacious
because...
for
reasons
which
we
have
discussed
in
my
brief.
i
want
to
reserve
a
couple
of
moments,
if
i
may,
and
before
doing
so,
may
i
just
draw
one
brief
parallel--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--all
right.
i
had
better
start
reserving
now,
then.
thank
you.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
may
it
please
the
court:
there
was
discussion
here
as
to
whether
the
passage
of
time
should
be
taken
as
charging
the
vessel,
passage
of
time
alone
should
be
taken
as
charging
the
vessel
with
notice
of
a
defect.
that
was
exactly
the
problem
in
the
albanese
case
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
that
if
it
determined
the
condition
had
existed
long
enough,
to
charge
the
shipowner
with
notice
of
it;
they
could
hold
the
shipowner.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit
said,
that
was
erroneous.
this
court
said,
we
believe
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous,
and
therefore
set
it
aside,
citing
as
the
single
case
of
gutierrez
v.
waterman
steamship,
which
was
aptly
cited
for
the
purpose.
this
was
one
of
the
cases
which
was
cited
as
in
the
legislative
history
as
one
which...
it
was
not
supposed
to
happen
again,
in
principle
at
least.
now,
the
gutierrez
case,
which
had
been
cited
here
as
authority
for
the
albanese
case,
was
a
case
which
itself
explicitly
rested
upon
nondelegable
duty.
well,
this
court
said,
as
a
basis
for
its
decision,
the
shipowner
had
an
absolute
and
nondelegable
duty
of
care
toward
petitioner
and
not
to
create
this
risk
for
him.
and
you
were
dealing
with
negligence
at
that
time.
there
are,
however,
other
negligence
cases,
not
so
many
for
the
reason
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
others
pointed
out,
but
there
are
other
negligence
cases
before
1972,
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
and
which
we
submit
are
harmonious
with
the
formulation
of
duty
which
the
restatement
would
lay
down
and
which
we
have
adopted
here.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
no.
i
said,
we
don't
have
to
buy
it.
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
we
have
stated--
mr.
graydon
s.
staring
--no.
we
have
stated
it
separately,
and
not
in
restatement
terms,
and
we
feel
it
can
be
reconciled
or
can
be
supported
by
the
restatement,
by
any
of
a
number
of
other
sources.
the
oil
spill
was
discussed
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
as
we
read
the
oil
spill
illustration,
it
illustrates
the
difference
between
unseaworthiness
before
and
negligence
after.
and
where
it
refers
to
notice,
what
it
means
is
that
in
negligence
notice
is
necessary,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
notice
is
always
sufficient.
there
are
instances,
of
course,
in
which
the
vessel
owner
would
be
held
for
the
oil
spill,
and
instances
in
which
he
wouldn't.
it
depends
on
whether
the
spill
is
obvious
or
not,
whether
it's
in
an
area
that's
under
the
control
of
the
stevedore,
whether
it
was
created
by
the
vessel's
personnel,
when
it
was
created,
and
so
on.
if
it's
an
oil
spill
in
an
area
over
which
the
vessel
has
retained
essential
control
but
which
longshoremen
have
to
pass
through,
that
presents
an
entirely
different
situation
and
one
which
arises
in
the
course
of
work.
so,
there's
no
pat
result
so
far
as
oil
spills
are
concerned.
finally,
it
was
suggested...
it's
been
suggested
that
there
was
a
big
difference
here,
whether...
as
to
what
rule
you
might
apply
to
the
stevedore
and
to
the
longshoreman
himself.
and
i'd
like
to
suggest
that,
as
was
explicitly
said
by
this
court
in
federal
marine
terminals
v.
burnside,
if
kermarec
does
mean
anything
in
these
circumstances
in
abolishing
the
distinction
between
licensees
and
invitees
and
other
irrational
distinctions,
it
means
as
was
pointed
out
in
federal
marine
terminals
v.
burnside
that
the
same
rule
of
duty,
the
same
duty
of
care
applies
to
the
stevedore
contractor
and
to
his
employees
and
that
that
distinction
should
not
be
made.
that
was
quite
explicit
there.
the
fortuity,
finally,
of
presence
of
someone
on
the
vessel
should
not
determine
the
duty.
there
is
no
duty
to
be
there
and
inspect,
as
this
court
recognized
in
west,
and
therefore
no
special
duty
because
one
happens
to
be
there.
thank
you,
your
honors.
