mr.
james
a.
grutz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
james
grutz.
i
represent
the
respondent,
lauro
de
los
santos,
individual
longshoreman,
who
was
injured
in
the
way
that
is
described
in
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
brief.
i
would
like
to
start
with
what
i
believe
the
amendments,
1972
amendments,
did
in
this
case,
or
as
they
apply
to
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
amendments
said
that
if
there
was
negligence
and
that
negligence
of
a
shipowner
injured
a
longshoreman,
that
he
had
a
suit
for
negligence
against
the
shipowner.
secondly,
it
did
away
with
any
indemnity
actions
by
the
shipowner
against
the
stevedoring
company
for
the
breach
of
the
warranty
of
workmanlike
service.
that's
the
ryan
case.
and
thirdly,
it
did
away
with
the
doctrine
of
unseaworthiness.
there
is
no
mention
in
the
statute
about
standards
involving
landbased
duties.
there
is
no
mention
in
the
statute
about
invitees.
there
is
no
mention
in
the
statute
about
independent
contractors,
and
so
forth.
there
is
simply
the
statement
that
negligence
actions
are
permitted
by
longshoremen
who
are
injured
against
shipowners.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
landbased,
your
honor,
is
not
a
term
of
art.
it
can
mean
probably
150
different
things.
for
instance,
within
the
law
of
invitees,
the
premises
liability
areas
of
landbased
law
probably...
there
are
50
different
tests
within
the
united
states.
there
are
probably
three
or
four
different
subtests
within
each
of
those
tests
within
the
united
states.
so,
i
don't
know
what
landbased
means,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
no,
i
think
congress
has
given
us
some
guides,
your
honor.
i
think
the
congress
intended
and
i
think
the
statute
is
clear,
and
unambiguous.
the
statute
does
away
with
unseaworthiness,
with
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness.
it
preserves
the
maritime
negligence
action
which
existed
prior
to
the
amendments.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
it
doesn't
say
what
it
is
but
i
think
that
it's--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--that's
correct.
it
doesn't
say
what
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
negligence
cases
which
existed
prior
to
the
amendments,
and
that
they
are
said
then
to
have
adopted
what
the
courts
had
said
about
what
those
duties
were.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
now,
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
statute
is
clear
and
the
legislative
history
is
not
necessary.
but
all
the
courts
that
have
examined
the
question
have
found
it
helpful
to
go
to
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history,
i
maintain,
is
perfectly
consistent
with
my
position.
that
is,
the
legislative
history
discusses
several
items.
number
one,
they
wanted
a
uniform
national
federal
standard,
and
i
would
submit
that
prior
to
the
amendments
there
was
a
national,
uniform
federal
standard,
and
it
was
the
general
maritime
law--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
it
was
the
general
maritime
law
as
it
applied
to
negligence
actions.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
as
to
duty,
it
came
out
of
the
various
cases
that
were,
that
wended
their
way
up
the
court
system
in
those
decisions.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
most
cases
were
on
the
seaworthiness
basis.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
well,
you
get
it--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--most
of
the
time
it's
connected.
most
of
the
time
they
overlap.
but
there
are
some
cases,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--well,
i
think
that
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn
recognizes
a
duty
that--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--but
it
also
recognized
the
fact
that
sieracki
did
not
do
away
with
the
negligence
action.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
much
easier
to
prove?
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct.
and
so,
most
of
the
cases
that
come
up
are
in
that
vein;
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
it
says
that
the
shipowner
owes
a
duty
of
due
care
under
the
circumstances
to
maintain
a
safe
place
to
work
and
to
correct
dangerous
conditions
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
yes,
sir.
it's
page
i-10
of
the
appendix
to
my
brief.
i
put
the
whole
committee
report
as--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--yes,
yes.
the
language
is
exactly
the
same
in
both.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
the
language
in
the
senate
report...
and
it's
identical
in
the
house
report...
is
that
nothing...
"thus,
nothing
in
this
bill
is
intended
to
derogate
from
the
vessel's
responsibility
to
take
appropriate
corrective
action
where
it
knows
or
should
have
known
about
a
dangerous
condition.
"
mr.
james
a.
grutz
and
the
one
before
that--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--all
right.
i
think
it
means
that
the
shipowner
has
an
obligation
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
make
sure
that
the
working
place
is
safe.
the
landbased
language
is
used...
it's
in
several
instances
in
the
legislative
history.
and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
landbased
language
is
not
used
as
a
term
of
art,
it
is
used
as
a
descriptive
term
which
differentiates
it
from
the
sieracki
unseaworthiness
cases
which
are
being
done
away
with
by
the
amendments
to
the
act.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
well,
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
notice.
the
difference
between
a
seaworthiness
case
and
a
negligence
case
is
basically
notice.
and
i
think
that
a
full
reading
of
the
committee
report
points
out
the
difference,
and
i
think
this
court
in
cases
has
recognized
the
difference.
in
gutierrez
there's
a
discussion
of
the
difference
between
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
in
one
case
the
actor
to
be
negligent
must
be
put
on
notice
or
have
an
opportunity
to
know,
either
actual
or
constructive
notice,
of
the
the
danger.
otherwise,
he
cannot
be
said
to
have
the
duty.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
to
the
shipowner.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
oh,
the
notice
as
regards
contributory
negligence
or
comparative
negligence?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
it
is
my
position
that
the
notice
would
have
to
run
to
the
individual
longshoreman,
because
he's
the
one...
for
instance,
in
this
case...
that
the
district
court
said,
knew
and
appreciated
this
particular
risk,
and
subjected
himself
to
it.
so
that
he
barred
the
district
court
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
barred
the
plaintiff
from
any
recovery
or
from
ever
going
to
the
jury
on
the
basis,
simply,
of
was
there
an
open
and
obvious
danger?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
as
a
matter
of
law,
your
honor,
he
cannot
be
barred
because
the
open
and
obvious
danger
becomes
assumption
of
the
risk.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
evidence
put
on
that
there
was
negligence,
that
there
was
a
failure
to
remedy
the
winch,
which
was
an
integral
part
of
the
ship,
and
the
shipowner
reserved
the
right
by
regulation
and
by
practice
to
repair
that
winch,
that
to
simply
say
that
if
a
longshoreman
recognized
some
danger,
an
individual
longshoreman
recognized
some
danger,
that
he
as
a
matter
of
law
cannot
recover,
is
simply
to
say
that
he
then
knows
and
appreciates
a
risk,
accepts
the
risk,
and
then
we're
into
the
assumption
of
risk
argument,
which
congress
in
the
legislative
reports
has
proscribed.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
absolutely.
and
the
oil
spill
example--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--but
the
responsibility
to
someone
else--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--it
illustrates
it
perfectly.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
and
it
talks
about
the
notice.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
so
the
illustration--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--i
think
congress
did
not
put
it
in
the
statute
because
they
assumed
that
negligence
had
a
meaning,
that
the
significant
meaning
of
negligence...
that
there
had
been
a
negligence
action
preserved
in
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
ever
since
its
inception...
and
that
it
had
a
meaning
which
they
were
willing
to
accept.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
that
they're
saying
that
to
resolve
these
questions,
there
are
going
to
be
trials,
there
are
going
to
be
cases
submitted
to
factfinders
to
decide
whether
there
was
the
failure
to
operate
with
ordinary
care.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
absolutely.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
right.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--that's
correct.
there's
no
doubt
that
they
are
indicating
their
belief
that
sieracki...
they
take
two
oil
spill
examples
and
juxtapose
them,
the
first
one,
they
say
there
is
no
notice
but
under
sieracki
the
longshoreman
could
recover.
the
second
one,
they
describe,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
read
here,
and
what
is
retained,
then,
is
the
negligence
action.
and
so
they
believe...
yes...
that
he
can
recover.
and
earlier
in
the
discussions
they
advocate
that
this
is
good,
this
is
something
that
they
want
to
preserve,
because
it
encourages
safety
considerations.
so
that
mr.
staring's
approach
would
be
that
if
the
danger
is
open
and
obvious
enough,
that
a
longshoreman
walking
up
the
gangplank
could
or
should
have
seen
grease
on
the
deck
or
you-name-it,
the
winch
is
rusty,
there
is
a
hole
in
the
deck,
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
or
there's
a
sign
saying,
here
are
all
the
deficiencies
of
this
vessel,
that
at
that
point
they're
immunized.
now,
that
is
not
consistent
with
what
the
legislative
history
says
over
and
over
again,
that
nothing
in
this
bill
is
to
derogate
from
their
duty
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
furnish
a
safe
place
for
this
person
to
work.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
it
may
very
well
be.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
it's
an
advisor
to
congress,
a
law
clerk,
perhaps,
or
a...
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
legislative
clerk
of
some
sort
who
is...
the
problem,
though,
is
that
they
have
misunderstood,
i
think,
the
impact
of
landbased.
landbased
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
convey
anything.
there
can
be
so
many
meanings
for
the
term
that
all
it
does
is
confuse,
and
it's
only--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--yes,
sir?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
there
has
to
be
evidence
of
either
actual
or
constructive
notice
of
some
sort;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
absolutely
not.
i
have
to
come
within
the
guidelines
of
the
second
oil
spill
example
where--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--reasonable
notice.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
well,
there's
this,
that
the
winch
had
been
malfunctioning
for
about
2-1/2
days
prior
to
this
accident.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
the
stevedore
was
running
it...
by
the
evidence,
your
honor,
this
was
the
third
report.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
don't
think
that's
in
the
record
as
such.
i
think
that
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
the
stevedore's
use
of
the
winch
was
contemporaneous
with
testimony
about
the
malfunctioning
of
the
winch.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
no.
and
the
reason
i
say
that--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--it's...
it
was
there
that
the--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--whether
he
should
have
known.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
whether
he
should
have
known
under
the
circumstances
that
the--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--that's
the
lettuce
leaf
on
the
floor
in
the
grocery
store.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
absolutely.
it
was
there
long
enough...
so
that
in
terms
of
reasonable
care,
the
owner
of
the
establishment
could
have
discovered
the
situation.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
there's
no
question
in
my
mind,
your
honor,
that
the
landowner-invitee
test
is
absolutely
inconsistent
and
incompatible
with
the
amendments
to
the
statute.
there's
absolutely
no
question
about
it.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct,
and
i
think
they're
wrong.
and
i
think
they've
recognized
their
errors.
if
you
read
gay
and
napoli,
the
thrust
of
those
opinions
talks
about
adopting
343
and
343(a)
but
there
is
a
lot
of
cautioning
going
on
within
the
course
of
their
discussions,
so
that
they
know
they're
treading
on
very
thin
ice,
and
the
problem
is,
is
that
you
get
into
situations
in
which
you
take
from
the
jury,
that
the
questions
by
simply
focusing
on,
was
it
open
and
apparent?
and
so
that,
if
the
inquiry
begins
and
ends
with,
was
it
open
and
apparent,
you
foreclose
the
longshoreman
from
ever
looking
at
the
negligence
of
the
shipowner.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
the
statute
does
not
talk
about
invitees,
landbased
law,
independent
contractor,
et
cetera.
it
talks
about
maintaining
the
negligence
action.
the
legislative
history
talks
about
retaining
the
negligence
action.
and
the
retention
of
the
negligence
standard,
i
would
submit,
means
that
if
the
shipowner
has
failed
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
fix
something...
in
other
words,
there
is
a
duty
to
do
something
about
it,
it
isn't
simply
to
warn,
it
isn't
simply
to
say,
you
should
have
seen
it,
therefore
it's
your
problem.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
well,
under
the
343--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--343
and
343(a)
is;
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
about
other
landbased
law,
but
the
ones
that
have
been
suggested
here
are
definitely
inconsistent--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--and
with
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
it's
been
suggested
in
some
of
these
cases
that
the
use
of
that
term
is
not
a
term
of
art.
it
is
simply
a
descriptive
term
which
differentiates
the
former
seaworthiness
warranty
versus
negligence.
and
i
think
that's...
if
you
read
the
two
oil
spill
examples,
it
becomes
clear,
that
what
we're
talking
about--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--they
could
have
been,
absolutely.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
am
reluctant
to
say,
yes,
because
i
don't
know
what
the
landbased
rule
means,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--i
think
that
the
state
courts
are
all
tending
toward
the
duty
of
a
person,
of
a
landowner,
to
exercise
reasonable
care
under
the
circumstances,
which
is
exactly
the
standard
of
care
which
the
9th
circuit
adopted
in
this
case.
so
that
the
tendency
is
that
direction,
your
honor,
even
though
there
are
remnants
of
the
old,
of
the
feudal
idea
that
the
landowner
is
king
on
his
premises
and
nobody
shall
tread
there,
and
he's
in
a
special
status.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
if
the
court
adopts
343
and
343(a),
it's
dependent
on
state
law,
the
law
of--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--pardon?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
if
it
doesn't,
i
think
the
9th
circuit
test
and
the
kermarec
test
are
statements
of
a
test
which
are
uniform
and
federal,
and
would--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--absolutely.
they
want
a
uniform
test.
the
problem
is
that
you...
if
you
incorporate,
generally
speaking,
the
343
and
343(a)
test,
we
don't
know
the
various
ways
in
which
it's
been
interpreted
by
all
the
different
jurisdictions.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
what
we've
got
with
the
9th
circuit
opinion
is
a
negligence
test
that
everyone
can
understand.
it's
easy
of
application,
it's
simple,
it's
practical,
and
it's
correct
in
the
sense
that
there
preserves
the
negligence
action.
it
does
not
bring
into
the
picture
the
sieracki
doctrine
again.
it
has
to
be
notice,
either
constructive
or
actual,
in
order
for
a
longshoreman
to
recover.
and
so
that,
i
would
submit,
that
the
decision
and
the
test
which
is
stated
by
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
the
correct
one.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct,
but
i
would
assume
it's
because--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--absolutely.
there's
no
question
about
it,
but
one
way
of
doing
it
is
not
to
incorporate
by
reference
feudalism.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
absolutely.
at
the
9th
circuit
it
was
asked,
well
what
about
all
of
these
opinions?
because
most
of
the
opinions
were
the
other
direction
at
that
time,
and
i
stated
that
i
believed
that
they
were
in
left
field
and
that
they
simply
were
wrong.
you
cannot
reconcile
343
and
343(a)
in
its
use
of
assumption
of
risk
and
contributory
negligence
with
what
congress
was
saying
here.
congress
said
very
clearly
in
the
reports
that
assumption
of
the
risk
has
no
place
in
these
cases
and
that
contributory
negligence
has
no
place
in
these
cases,
and
yet
the
district
court
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
law
said
that
once
mr.
santos
saw
some
danger,
he
was
forever
foreclosed
from
going
any
further.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
under
the
standard
of
the
9th
circuit?
oh,
yes,
certainly
there
is,
if
there
is...
in
other
words,
if
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
brought
as
a
respondent
i
would
have
the
obligation
of
putting
on
some
evidence
that
there
was
some
notice
to
the
shipowner
of
a
defect.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
no.
it
isn't,
your
honor.
the
joint
appendix
in,
i
think
it's
paragraph
7,
page
11,
the
pretrial
states
that
the...
i
think
it
says
control
of
the
workplace.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
right.
that's
correct.
they
were
in
control
of
the
loading,
but
they
were
not
in
control
of
the
winch.
they
were
in
control,
but
they
were
allowed...
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
grutz
yes.
i
think
the
regulation
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
indicates
that
in
the
case
of
a
malfunctioning
electrical
winch,
the
stevedore
company
has
absolutely
no
right
to
touch
or
try
to
repair
that
winch.
so
the
only
person
or
entity
that
has
the
power
to
remedy
what
we
advocate
is
going
wrong
on
the
ship
at
the
time
of
this
injury
is
the
shipowner.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
the
analogy
of
what,
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct.
but,
again,
i
think
what
you
get
down
to
is,
what
does
the
workplace
mean?
what
is
the...
i'm
sorry...
what
does
control
mean?
control
over
the
workplace
is
different
than
control
over
the
winch.
in
other
words,
the
ability
to
repair
the
difficulty
was
within...
the
shipowner.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
control
of
the
loading,
yes,
sir.
but
not
control
of
the
winch,
not
control
of
the
ability
to
remedy
the
problem
with
the
winch.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
why
shouldn't
he?
he
probably
should
have,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
said,
perhaps
he
should
have
quit
work.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
there
is
inference
from
the
evidence
that
he
did
tell
him,
but
it's
an
inference,
i
suppose.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
absolutely.
i
don't
think
the
injured
longshoreman...
in
fact,
there's
evidence
in
this
case
the
injured
longshoreman
didn't
even
know
or
appreciate
what
it
was
that
the
specific--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--he
was
trying
to
do
his
job,
he
was
working.
he
was...
he
had
a
sense
of
duty
to
clean
up
a
mess
and
that's
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
i
think
there's...
yes,
sir.
i
think
there's
all
the
more
reason
for
the--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--not
in
terms
of
the
tort
action,
the
negligence
tort
action
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
individual.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
injured
longshoreman.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
the
statute,
the
discussion
in
the
legislative
reports,
support
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
yes.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record--
mr.
james
a.
grutz
--that's
correct.
the
only
persons
who
testified
are
longshoremen.
and
they
testified
that
the
representatives
of
the
shipowner
were
back
and
forth
in
the
area.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
in
the
area.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
yes.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
the
evidence,
again,
is...
this
was
summary
judgment,
your
honor,
so
there
isn't
very
much
evidence.
but
the
evidence
is
that
the
representatives
of
the
shipowner
were
back
and
forth
in
the
area
where
this
was
going
on.
mr.
james
a.
grutz
and
there's
also
evidence
that
on
the
first
day
the
winch
driver
reported
to
his
supervisor
that
the
winch
was
jumpy,
it
was
not
holding,
the
brakes
were
not
holding,
and
at
that
time
he
was
told
that
the
day
shift
was
having
trouble
with
it
too,
but
that
they
could
not
do
anything
with
it.
and
i
think
there's
an
inference
that
the
"they"
that
they're
talking
about
was
the
shipowner.
because
"they"
were
the
only
ones
who
had
the
ability.
thank
you.
