justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
company,
and
the
individual
and
american
express;
could
american
express
have
gone
after
him
for
the
personal
charges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
do
you
make
then,
of
the
first
clause
of
section
104(1),
credit
transactions
involving
extensions
of
credit
for
business
or
commercial
purposes...
are
not
covered
by
the
subsection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
won
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
did
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
doesn't
that
mean
that
all
inferences
have
to
be
resolved
against
your
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
unless...
notwithstanding
his
failure
to
produce
affidavits,
there
was
a
genuine
issue
as
to
material
fact,
in
which
case
you
were
not
entitled
to
prevail.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
the
truth-in-lending
act
doesn't
deal
with
proper
business
etiquette,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
an
argument
over
a
bill
or
an
argument
over
a
plane
reservation
or
something
like
that
paid
for
with
a
credit
card
would
come
within
the
truth-in-lending
act
simply
because
it
was
a
violation
of
good
etiquette?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
summarize
in
about
two
sentences
what
you
think
american
express
should
have
done
under
the
statute
here
which
it
did
not
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
what
you
claim
was
erroneously
done
here,
when
the
credit
card
was
cut
in
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
going
to
happen
if
you
win?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
win?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean
in...
with
respect
to
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
since
there
isn't
any
money
involved,
what
happens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
just
kind
of
a...
like
they
used
to
say
in
michigan,
litigation
was
the
winter
sport
of
farmers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
look
at
the
application
on
page
27a
of
the
joint
appendix
at
the
very
bottom
there,
it's
in
small
print
"the
undersigned
individual
and
company
join
in
this
application.
"
and
apparently,
is
that
your
father's
signature
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
uncle's.
is
there
any
indication
in...
either
of
the...
either
the
district
court
proceedings
or
the
court
of
appeals,
what
american
express
would
have
done
if
your
uncle
or
your
father
had
refused
to
sign
those
portions
of
the
application?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
only
if
they
use
an
american
express
credit
card.
it
isn't
as
if
some
deal
not
involving
a
credit
card
arose.
