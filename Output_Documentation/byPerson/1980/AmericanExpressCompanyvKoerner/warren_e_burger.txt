chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
american
express
co.
v.
koerner.
mr.
greene,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
say
that
the
company
stood
behind
it.
are
you
suggesting
that
american
express
was
looking
only
to
the
corporation,
not
to
the
individuals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
clarify,
because
i
wasn't
sure
what
you
meant,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
relationship
between
american
express
and
mr.
koerner,
and
american
express
and
the
other
four
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
individually.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
the
record
show
as
to
the
payment
of
these
accounts?
payment
by
the
checks
of
the
corporation
in
all
instances,
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
are
we
to
infer
from
that
that
sometimes
the
employees
used
it
for
personal
purposes,
and
then
paid
with
a
personal
check,
but
when
it
was
for
a
corporate
purpose
it
was
paid
for
by
a
corporate
check?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
extent,
mr.
greene,
is
that
an
analogy
with
a
letter
of
credit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
koerner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
that
american
express
knows,
how
do
they
know?
because
personal
checks
were
sent
sometime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
american
express
have
an
obligation
to
find
out
whether
the
credit
was
extended
for
the
purchase
of
perfume
in
paris
or
an
airline
ticket,
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
greene?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
