mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
i
am
very
honored
and
pleased
to
be
here.
i
am
also
pleased
and
honored
that
this
narrow
and
somewhat
unique
case
as
important
as
it
is
to
my
family,
was
important
enough
to
merit
the
consideration
of
this
court.
this
is
a
litigation
that
need
never
have
happened.
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
man
of
principle
was
embarrassed
for
no
reason
by
employees
of
american
express
as
impersonal
as
the
computers
that
they
served.
this
is
a
lack
of...
this
case
arose
because
of
a
lack
of
good
manners
and
proper
etiquette
and
breakdown
of
proper
business
practices.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
well
in
a
way,
this...
the
fair
credit
billing
act
in
a
way
does.
what
they've
done
is,
they've
imposed
as
a
matter
of
law,
what
is
ordinarily
good
practice,
which
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
most
creditors
have
done
anyway.
that's
the
reason
i
mentioned
that.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no,
not
at
all.
what
happened
is--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--that's
correct.
what
would
have
happened
though,
here,
is
that--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--what
would
have
happened
here
is...
what
my
father
was
looking
for
was
an
apology,
and
this
suit
would
never
have
been
brought.
we
sent
a
draft
suit
to
american
express,
looking
for
an
apology
which
never
happened,
and
then
like,
things
got...
really
grew
and
grew
and
grew.
by
the
way,
you'd
be
interested
to
know
last
week
my
father
received
three
invitations
from
american
express
to
join...
two
corporate
and
one
personal.
john
e.
koerner
&
company
was
formed
in
1907
by
my
grandfather,
as
a
flower
wholesaler.
in
1965...
by
1965,
my
father
and
his
two
brothers,
both
of
whom
are
now
deceased,
were
the
managers
of
the
company.
in
1965,
they
made
a
decision
to
go
to
credit
cards,
company
credit
cards,
rather
than
use
individual
credit
or
cash
advances.
and
this
particular
card
my
father
signed
as
a
joint
applicant,
jointly
and
severally,
or
under
louisiana
law
what
they
call
in
solido
liable.
and
there
was
no
restriction
on
the
card
at
the
time
to
show
that
it
was
restricted
as
to
credit
or
as
to
use.
now,
there
was
no
credit
information
requested
of
the
individuals,
but
it
is
the
policy
of
credit
card
companies
to
investigate
the
individual's
credit
reference
in
a
closely
held
corporation,
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
either
way
as
to
whether
that
was
done.
if
you
remember
mr.
greene's
response
to
your
honors'
questions
indicated,
i
think,
some
ambiguity
as
to
whether
that
was
done
or
not.
so
i
don't
think
the
record
is
clear,
and
if
there's
any
inference
to
be
drawn,
it's...
the
inference
would
be
that
they
may
well
have
looked
to
the
individual's
credit
background.
my
father
is
well
known
to
the
whitney
bank
and
the
hibernia
bank,
and
to
the
international
milling
company.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
correct.
but
it
is
very
simple,
particularly
in
1965,
to
simply
run
a
credit
check
on
the
mainly
liable
individuals.
and
in
addition
to
that,
if
they
didn't
want
some
credit
of
the
individuals,
why
make
them
co-principals
and
jointly
and
severally
liable?
now,
what
happened
is
that
eventually...
one
other
thing
that's
interesting
about
this
is
that
the
credit
card
application
was
in
1965,
which
is
several
years
predating
the
truth-in-lending
act,
so
what
american
express
wishes
us
to
do
is
to
look
back
to
a
time
in
the
past
when
the
truth-in-lending
act
had
not
been
enacted,
nor
had
the
credit
card
amendments
been
enacted
in
order
to
find
a
manifestation
of
the
will
of
the
parties.
in
addition,
what's
interesting
here
is
that
during
that
intervening
period
of
time
in
the
'70's,
american
express
did
send
the
company
a...
let's
see,
the
method
by
which
a
complaint
could
be
made
and
acknowledged.
and
that's
reported
at...
in
judge
ball's
opinion
at
444
f.
supp.
at
342,
note
32.
he...
we
did
not
contend
that
was
an
estoppel
on
american
express,
because
that
wouldn't
affect
the
statutory
construction.
but
it
is
evidence
of
the
will
of
the
parties,
that
is,
one
of
the
only
manifestations
that
the
parties
have
made
that
there
is
some
will
that
this
should
be...
considered
consumer
credit.
now,
in
1975,
because
of
lack
of
use
by
mr.
john
e.
koerner,
jr.
and
personal
use
by
my
cousin,
ralph,
and
also
the
fact
that
bankamericards
were
free
and
had
no
fee,
they
decided
to
go
to
bankamericards
primarily.
with
regard
to
my
father,
he
kept
his
business
american
express
card
because
it
was
convenient
to
use
in
europe
on
european
trips
and
on
trips,
whether
it
was...
where
bankamericards
were
not
recognized.
now,
at
that
time,
they
sent
two
cards
back
but
were
never
credited.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
flight
insurance
that
was
automatically
billed
to
the
card.
for
a
period
of
time
that
was
a
satisfactory
arrangement,
then
it
was
cancelled.
they
continued
to
bill
the
koerner
company,
for
the
personal...
for
the
flight
insurance.
my
father
authorized
payment
for
a
while,
sending
letters
saying,
do
something.
but
then
it
got
to
the
point
where
he
felt
that
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
their
attention
was
just
to
simply
not
pay
and
send
them
a
letter
explaining
why
they
would
not
pay,
which
is
the
procedure
that
is
set
up
under
the
act.
now,
in
september
of
1976,
which
is
the
month
of
the
credit
card
revocation,
as
late
as
that
month,
my
father
sent
in
personal
checks
for
personal
business...
for
personal
use
of
the
card
during
that
month
or
the
preceding
month.
there
were
numerous
personal
checks
sent
over
a
period
of
time.
we
did
not
submit
an
affidavit,
but
we
did
answer
interrogatories
in
which
we
lined
out
some
of
the
personal
uses
that
he
was
able
to
find
by
going
through
his
cancelled
checks.
so,
for
a
period
of
time,
even
to
the
same
month
involved,
the
checks
individually
were
sent,
by
my
father
on
his
personal
account
for
personal
uses.
now,
in
1976--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--certainly.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
both.
okay,
first--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
we
require
both.
however,
we
have
both.
the
first
thing
is,
he's
jointly
and
severally
liable,
which...
i
don't
know
what
the
common
law
is,
but
under
louisiana
law,
that
means
he
is
a
co-principal.
so
that's
one--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--okay,
the
statute
protects
consumers.
he
is
a
consumer,
the
card
was
issued
to
him.
the
credit
card
application
talks
about
joining
in
the
application
with
the
company,
but
my
uncle
john,
he
was
an
individual
applicant.
so
the
card
was
issued
to
him
and
to
the
company,
jointly,
with
his
name
on
it
and
with
the
company's
name
on
it.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
that
is
one
possibility.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
correct.
but
that's...
i
think
it's
nice
to
have
both
though.
but
what
happens
here
is
that
there's...
in
addition
to
that,
on
the
revocation
there
were
no
extensions
of
credit.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
acknowledge
the
dispute.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
that...
even
an
apology
afterwards
would
have
worked.
but
beforehand,
this...
remember
there's
a
year
of
correspondence
between
the
company,
on
behalf
of
my
father
and
american
express.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
the
statute
requires
that
while
there
is
a
dispute,
and
american
express,
the
issuer
is
notified
of
the
dispute,
that
they
do
not
revoke
the
card
until
they
take
certain
steps,
that's
all.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
correct.
in
other
words,
what
happened
is
that...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
date
of
the
revocation
there
was
no
further
money
paid
on
the
account,
because
the
account
was
credited
in
full
by
american
express.
all
of
the
$55
worth
of
disputed
charges
were
acknowledged
and
credited
out,
as
having
been
improper.
there
was
never
any
money
paid.
so,
we
have
the
strongest
possible
situation.
we
have
no
extensions
of
credit
that
were
in
dispute;
merely
improper
charges
by
american
express
that
should
never
have
been
made.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
in
this
particular,
what's
going
to
happen--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--okay.
in
louisiana--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--it
will
reverse
the
summary
judgment.
i
don't
think
there's
any
money
to
be
involved,
because
the
remedy
under
the
act
is
if
there
is
a
dispute.
from
what
i
can
see,
there's
a
dispute
and
they
don't
acknowledge
it,
whatever
is
in
dispute
the
company
waives.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
it's
just
a
matter
of
principles.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
well,
of
course
what
happens
is
that
we
have
a
public
interest
in
this,
is
that,
we
are
appearing
in
a
way,
as
a
private
attorney
general
seeking
to
enforce
a
right
of
consumers
under
the
act.
and
the
act
provides
for
costs,
attorneys
fees
and
certain
out-of-pocket
expenses,
under,
i
think
it's
15
u.s.c.
1640.
and
so,
it's
not...
what's
happened
is
that
we
have
undergone
a
great
deal
of
time...
trouble--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
we
decide
whether
we
wish
to
go
forward
with
a
certification
of
a
class,
or
whether
at
that
point
the
case
should
be
over.
what
happened
is
that
there's
no
dispute
that
the
billings
in
question
were
in
error,
they've
been
credited
out.
so
the
first
prong
of
the
relief
was
voluntarily
granted.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
it
is
stipulated
by
the
parties.
i
believe
those
facts
are
stipulated.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
he's
paid
me,
we've
paid
costs
as
we've
gone
along,
in
addition,
he's
incurred
attorneys
fees.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
correct.
and
also
we
have,
the
class
has
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
it
also,
both
retrospective
and
prospective
relief.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
i
think
there's
a
statute
of
limitation
of
$100,000.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
oh
no,
it's
not
moot.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
we
filed
for
certification
of
the
class,
and
when
the
mandate
was
stayed,
we
suspended
the
action
in
the
district
court.
one
of
the
arguments
that
american
express
makes
talks
about
the
legislative
history.
it's
obvious
that
the
fair
credit
billing
act
was
part,
in
a
way,
in
the
truth-in-lending
act,
and
that
1603
should
not
be
applicable.
the
legislative
history
of
the
new
amendments
is
very
interesting,
because
what
happens
is
that
there
were
two
titles
to
it,
that's...
there
were
three.
the
first
title
incorporated
the
1974
amendments,
one
of
which
was
the
revocation
provision.
and
there
were
some
technical
amendments
that
were
talked
about
from
a
year
before,
from
the...
and
what
happened
in
the
legislative
history
it's
s
2616,
they
said,
"to
remove
any
possible
uncertainty
relating
to
the
coverage
of
all
credit
cards
under
the
act's
credit
card
amendments
section
135
should
be
added
as
follows.
"
--and
then
they
exempted
from
the
first
three
of
the
'70,
but
they
never
ever
thought
about
the
'74
act.
and
what
happened
is,
we
have
an
act
that
was,
i
don't
think
anybody
ever
really
considered
the
effect
of
what
they
were
doing.
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
they
really
should
have
thought
more
fully
about
the
consequences
of
whether
the
business
exemption
might
be
contended
to
be
applicable
to
the
'74
amendments.
now,
my
contention
is
that
the
'74
amendment
with
regard
to
revocation
is
like
the
unauthorized
use
in
that
you
don't
have
a
credit
transaction
and
that
it's
only
to
credit
transactions
that
the
exemption
would
apply
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
what
was?
i'm
sorry?
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was...
they
would
not
apply
it
because
the
man
was
a
consumer.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no.
what
they
did
was,
they
termed
it
an
obviously
difficult
question--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--and
ducked
it.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
that
is
an
available
alternative
grounds
for
consideration
by
the
court.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
certainly.
that
was
the
main
contention
that
we
urged
and
it
was
only
as
an
alternative
that
the
fifth
circuit
took
the
idea
that
under
the
louisiana
law,
the
man
was
a
consumer
because
of
the
in
solido
provisions,
and
the
agreement
between
the
parties.
american
express'
argument
at
the
present
time
is
that
you
should
go
all
the
way
back
to
1965
to
try
to
decipher,
give
a
presumption
of
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
but
it
seems
like
a
total
fiction.
what
happens
is
that
american
express
over
a
period
of
years,
knows
that
this
card
has
been
used
for
personal
purposes
because
they
paid
by
personal
checks.
why
should
we
use
that
as
a
manifestation
of
the
will
of
the
parties?
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no.
but
i
think
that
what
we're
doing
is
we're
looking
for
any
objective
manifestation
of
the
will
of
the
parties,
rather
than
using
the
fiction.
american
express
either
has
to
say
you
can
only
use
it
for
business
purpose,
or
we've...
somebody
has
to
say
something.
because
what
happens
here
is
we
have
an
absolute,
we
have
a
neutral
factual
background,
except
for
receipt
and
acceptance
by
american
express
of
personal
checks.
the...
i
think
some
burden
has
to
be
on
the
card
issuer,
at
the
renewal,
to
make
it
clear--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--yes.
in
a
way,
that's
true.
but
what
happens
here
is
we
have
a
relationship
that
predates
the
statute,
so
at
some
point
or
other
in
the
relationship,
they
had
to
make
a
decision
on
whether
to
comply
or
not.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
well
they...
they
don't
seem
to
be
able
to
differentiate
the
correspondence
from
the
company
saying
something
is
wrong,
i
mean
if
they
have
that
burden,
why
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
differentiate
between
personal
checks
and
not?
what
happens
here
is
you
have
an
account
where
there
is
the
capacity
to
incur
personal
obligations.
and
we
have
situation
where,
as
i
read,
and
under
the
louisiana
law,
my
father
was
responsible
for
every
debt
on
the
credit
card.
i
wonder
what
the
collection
agent
would
have
done
if
the
company
had
refused
to
pay.
would
they
have
put
it
on
my
father's--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--no,
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
that
says
that.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
oh
well,
that's
true.
in
other
words,
what
happens
is--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--they
would
have
gone
for
my
father.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
they
sent
it
to
the
company.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
15
u.s.c.
1637
provides
that
you're
supposed
to
give
individual
notice
to
the
consumer.
and
i
allege
that
that
was
violated
also.
that's
also,
i
think,
one
of
the
administrative
interpretations
suggest
that
they
should
have
sent...
using
the
same
language,
that
they
should
have
sent
a
notice
to
the
consumer.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
that's
my
uncle's.
my
father's
is
on
the
following
page.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no.
that
wasn't
something
that
was
important
at
the
time.
what
has
happened...
well,
the
same
thing
with
regard
to,
i
think
we
have
to
look
to
the...
to
what
happened
in
1976,
and
not
looking
at
1981
amendments
and
things
of
this
nature.
what
was
the
relationship
of
the
parties
at
the
time?
they
had
sent
a
disclosure
statement
talking
about
credit
revocation.
that
was
one
objective
manifestation
of
the
will
of
the
parties
initiated
by
american
express.
the
obverse
or
converse
was
the
acceptance
of
personal
checks
for
a
number
of
personal
transactions.
under
those
circumstances,
the
burden
was
on
american
express.
american
express...
most
credit
card
issuers
in
my
experience
comply...
whether
it's
business
card
or
personal
card...
they
comply
with
the
credit
revocation
statute
under
any
circumstances
because
it's
good
business
to
do
so.
it's
no
more
trouble
to
do
so;
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
easier
than
as
mr.
greene
says...
only
ten
percent
of
their
cards
are
business
cards...
are
issued
to
corporations.
the
other
90
percent
are
personal.
it
seems
to
me
it
would
probably
be...
much
easier.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
no.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
the
reason
was
to
avoid
the
company
advancing,
or
him
advancing
his
own
personal
funds
to
the
company,
rather
than
use
of
the
credit
card.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
well
okay.
what
happened--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
that
the
company
pays
for.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
true,
but
he's
a
principal
of
the
company.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
$20,
for
free?
no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
the
reason
he
shouldn't,
is
that
for
this
card...
every
transaction
makes
american
express
money,
whether
they
choose--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--correct.
and
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--well
what
happened
is,
in
1965
that
was
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
because
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
personal
card
or
business
card
or
whatever.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
agreed.
i
think
that
that's
american
express'
argument;
that
that's
the
time
when
you
look
to
the
objective
manifestation
of
the
will
of
the
parties.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
the
company--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--the
company
was
billed
in
1975.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
at
that
time--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
precisely.
but--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--that's
true,
that
would
be
the
quid
pro
quo.
he
would
not
be--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--he
would
not
be
getting
a
free
ride
therefore,
because
he
swapped
the
$20--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--yes
sir.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
that
was.
but
the--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--he
did
not
play
the
$20,
but--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--the
company.
of
which
he
was
vice
president.
but
on
the
other
hand,
he
swapped
unlimited
liability
for
any
use
by
the
company.
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
only
for
his
own
use.
but
what
happens
if
my
cousin
ralph
decides
to
run
off
with--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--well
american
express,
by
the
terms
of
the
application,
invited
him
to
become
liable
for
any
use
by
other
people
that
they
issued
the
card
to.
they
issued
four
cards
to
the
koerner
company
and
its
employees.
and
so
my
father,
under
louisiana
law,
and
the
terms
of
the
application,
was
stuck
if
american
express
chose
to
do
so,
for
what
my
cousin
ralph
did,
my
uncle
john,
anyone
else--
mr.
louis
r.
koerner,
jr.
--precisely.
this
is
only
american
express
credit
card.
in
other
words,
what
happened
is
that
american
express
wished
to
get
the
personal
liability
of
each
of
the
cardholders
for
all
of
the
debts
on
all
of
the
cards
of
the
whole
of
the
company.
and
that
is
a
mighty
tough
bargain
for
not
having
to
pay
$20.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
your
honors?
thank
you
very
much.
