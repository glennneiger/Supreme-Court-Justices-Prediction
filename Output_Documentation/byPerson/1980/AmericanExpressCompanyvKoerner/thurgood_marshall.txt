apologize?
isn't
that
the
word
you
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
does
a
whole
lot
of
things,
but
it
doesn't
require
apologies,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
what
does
the
statute
require?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
what
they
could
do,
they
could
have
looked
to
the
contract
which
said
you
can
negotiate
that
point.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
did
so.
it
said
that
among
the
people...
you
can
negotiate
as
to
who
should
be
responsible.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--so
they
could
have
done
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
did
they
send
the
bill
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
listen,
if--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--if
the
respondent
in
this
case
had
taken
out
a
personal
american
express
card
and
paid
for
it
then
he
wouldn't
have
this
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
was
the
only
reason
for
doing
this
to
save
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
was
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he'd
have
an
american
express
credit
card,
just
like
he
had
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
would
have
paid
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
he's
got
one
for
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
to
him,
it's
free.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
should
he
give
up
something
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
the
only
way
for
american
express
to
make
money
is
for
you
to
pay
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
and
he
didn't
want
to
pay,
so
he
goes
under
the
company's,
and
now
he
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
cannot
expect
to
be
bound
by
1965.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
did
you
bill
him
in
1975?
justice
thurgood
marshall
1980?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can't
we
look
at
that?
instead
of
looking
at
'65?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
at
that
time,
he
was
getting
a
free
ride?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--not
a
free
ride.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
wasn't
paying...
so
far,
as
the
annual
$20
cost...
did
you
hear
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
a
free
ride
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
pay
the
$20,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
paid
the
$20?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he
have
had
that
if
he'd
have
had
his
own
card?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can't
get
involved
with
your
cousin
and
your
uncle.
i'm
talking
about
this
case
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
a
family
affair,
let
the
family
work
it
out.
but
don't
bother
us
with
it.
