did
the
company
investigate
the
credit
rating
of
any
of
mr.
koerner...
or
of
any
of
the
other
four
employees?
justice
stewart
but
it
could
have
gone
after
the
individual
for
all
of
the
charges,
couldn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
your...
that
argument
depends
upon
the
hypothesis,
does
it
not,
that
the
extension
of
credit
occurs
when
the
card
is
issued?
justice
stewart
yes.
justice
stewart
and
i
thought
of
a
credit
card,
or
at
least
it
can
be
argued,
that
a
credit
card
is
no
more
than
an
agreement
to
extend
credit
in
the
future.
justice
stewart
even
though
the
card
is
put
by
the
cardholder
into
his
desk
drawer
and
never
used?
justice
stewart
that's
an
extension
of
credit?
justice
stewart
it's
not...
well,
it's
an
agreement
to
extend
credit
in
the
future,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
well,
it
has
to
be
to
support
your
argument,
does
it
not?
justice
stewart
to
support
your
statutory
argument?
justice
stewart
there's
no
question
here
that
there
was
a
violation
of
law?
justice
stewart
if
this
was
covered
by
law.
justice
stewart
but
the
credit
information
was
submitted
only
with
respect
to
the
corporation?
justice
stewart
what's
the...
what
stake
does
your
client
have
in
this
controversy
now
that
would
qualify
as
article
iii
standing?
justice
stewart
this
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
stewart
the
inapplicability?
justice
stewart
yes.
but
had
it
been
a
business
card.
your
present
argument
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
in
any
event
this
particular
provision
is
not
applicable.
justice
stewart
and
that
was
not
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stewart
correct.
justice
stewart
right.
