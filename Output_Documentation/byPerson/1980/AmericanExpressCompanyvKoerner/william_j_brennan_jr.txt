justice
jr.
well
mr.
greene,
isn't
your
position
pretty
much
that
the
key
really
is
the
purpose
of
the
extension
of
credit...
and
where
the
purpose
is
business
and
it
is
established
here
by
the
application
form
itself
as
being
for
business...
that
brings
you
within
the
exemption?
justice
jr.
so
mr.
greene,
what's
the
significance
of
the
last
sentence
of
letter
727,
"however
we
suspect
that
few
cards,
if
any,
which
are
issued
with
a
corporation
as
the
cardholder
would
fall
within
this
category.
"
isn't
there
an
implication
in
that
that
there
might
be
some
cards?
justice
jr.
i
mean,
although
ostensibly
a
business
card,
where
in
fact
it
is
established
that
it
was
primarily
for
personal
use,
this
suggests
that
while
ordinarily
that
wouldn't
happen
with
a
corporate
card,
it
might
happen.
justice
jr.
you
mean,
at
the
time
of
the
issuance?
justice
jr.
well
i
gather
probably
american
express
would
not
have
issued
a
card
in
the
name
of
the
company
then,
would
it?
justice
jr.
well
let's
see,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
summary
judgment?
justice
jr.
so
now
you're
supposed
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court?
justice
jr.
what
happens
in
the
trial
court?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
won't
the
district
court
have
to
agree
with
that
proposition?
justice
jr.
what
happens
if
you
lose,
we
affirm?
what
goes
on
in
the
district
court?
justice
jr.
and
suppose
the
court
refuses
to
certify
the
class,
then
what?
justice
jr.
how
about
the
damages
for
humiliation,
ripping
your
card
up,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
is
that
independently,
or
is
that--
justice
jr.
--was
all?
