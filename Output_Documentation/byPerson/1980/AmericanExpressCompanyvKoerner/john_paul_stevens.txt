mr.
koerner,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
basic
theory
here?
is
it
that
the
individual
is
jointly
liable
on
the
account,
or
is
it
that
the
individual
made
some
personal
use
of
the
account.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
require
both,
or...
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
how
does...
we
have
to
relate
it
back
to
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
under
that
construction,
you
would
win,
if
all
of
the
transactions
were
business
transactions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
possibility
is
that
if
there's
any
one
personal
transaction
on
the
account,
you
would
win
even
if
he
weren't
jointly
liable,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
koerner,
you
filed
this
as
a
class
action,
didn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
has
the
class
been
certified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
because
the
district
court
ruled
against
you
on
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
now,
i
suppose,
on
remand
it
would
be
open
to
certify
a
class
and
recover
the
ten
million
dollars
or
whatever
it
is
you
sued
for,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ten
thousand
dollars.
whatever
it
is,
but
if
there
are
other
members
of
the
class
who
have
a
similar
claim,
i
suppose
the
case
is
not
moot,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
koerner,
if
you
wait
till
the
account
is
paid,
isn't
that
too
late
for
them
to
comply
with
the
pre-extension
of
credit
disclosure
requirement?
if
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
paid
the
check
personally,
that's
a
little
late
for
them
to
comply
with
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
assuming
the
computer
can
differentiate
between
personal
checks
and
other
kinds
of
checks?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
why
do
you
say
yes?
wasn't
the
individual
liable
on
the
account?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
he
liable
for
all
of
the
company
debts,
not
only
his
own,
under
the
agreement?
so
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
greene,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
question
about...
i
think
judge
wisdom's
theory.
why
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
only
consideration
for
the
guarantee...
it
isn't
a
guarantee...
but
the
joint
responsibility
for
the
account
on
the
part
of
the
individual,
was
that
the
individual
was
going
to
get
individual
credit
for
consumer
purposes,
for
non-business
purposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
not
a
surety,
as
i
understand
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well
what
could
the
individual
possibly
be
doing
for
which
he
would
accept
individual
liability
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
in
the
nature
of
a
surety
relationship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
have
this
agreement,
say
somebody
like
u.s.
steel...
a
very
large
corporation,
they
have
cards
for
literally
dozens
of
people,
i
suppose,
do
they
assume
individual
liability
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
analogy
wouldn't
apply
there.
it's
not
because
you're
concerned
about
the
credit
investigations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
frequent
situation
where
you
have
an
individual
on
a
company
card
is
that
everybody
expects
him
to
use
it
for
personal
purposes.
