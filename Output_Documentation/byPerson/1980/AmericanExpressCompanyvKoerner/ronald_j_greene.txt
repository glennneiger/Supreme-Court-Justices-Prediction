mr.
ronald
j.
greene
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
turns
on
what
we
view
as
a
relatively
simple
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
requires
the
court
to
construe
the
meaning
of
section
104(1)
of
the
truth-in-lending
act.
that
section
provides
an
exemption
from
the
entire
act
for
business
credit
transactions.
the
precise
statutory
language
is,
"transactions
involving
extensions
of
credit
for
business
or
commercial
purposes.
"
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
this
language
makes
the
truth-in-lending
act
inapplicable
to
the
business
credit
cards
issued
by
american
express
to
the
company
for
which
respondent
works.
now
american
express
says
that
the
exemption
applies
because
the
cards
in
question
were
business
cards,
obtained
by
a
business
enterprise
for
business
purposes.
respondent
counters
that
the
exemption
should
not
apply
because
he,
together
with
his
employer,
was
jointly
liable
for
any
charges
on
the
account
and
because
allegedly,
on
some
occasions
he
used
the
card
to
make
personal
purchases.
now,
time
permitting,
there
are
three
basic
points
that
i'd
like
to
cover
this
morning.
first,
i'd
like
to
review
briefly
the
precise
statutory
language
that
we
feel
is
dispositive.
it
is
our
position
that
this
language
clearly
and
without
any
equivocation,
exempts
all
business
card
systems
from
the
truth-in-lending
act.
second,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
position
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
taken
on
the
issues
before
the
court.
under
this
court's
decision
in
ford
motor
v.
milhollin,
the
rulings
of
the
federal
reserve
board
are,
we
think,
dispositive.
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
touch
on
the
fundamental
policy
considerations
that
we
think
are
reflected
in
the
business
credit
exemption.
and
the
fifth
circuit
decision
which
we've
asked
this
court
to
reverse
is
particularly
troublesome
because
it
reflects
an
insensitivity
to
these
fundamental
policy
considerations.
and
also,
because
it
might
lead
to
the
imposition
of
an
exceptionally
complicated
and
convoluted
regulatory
scheme
in
an
area
where
congress
and
the
federal
reserve
board
never
thought
that
it
should
be
applied.
application
of
those
regulations
in
this
area
would
impose
wholly
unnecessary
regulatory
costs
in
an
area
that
congress
specifically
decided
it
was
not
going
to
regulate.
now,
there
are
no
disputes
about
the
facts
in
this
case;
it
comes
here
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
mr.
koerner,
the
respondent,
was
an
officer
of
the
john
e.
koerner
&
co.
in
1965,
the
company
applied
to
american
express
for
issuance
of
a
company
card
for
mr.
koerner's
use.
other
employees
also
were
to
receive
cards;
five
cards
were
ultimately
issued
on
this
account.
american
express
checked
out
the
company's
credit,
and
issued
all
five
cards.
it
also
obtained
mr.
koerner's
individual
signature,
and
that
made
him
liable
together
with
the
company
for
any
charges
on
his
particular
card...
not
on
the
other
four
cards,
but
on
his
particular
card.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
no,
mr.
justice,
just
the
company.
if
you
look
at
the
application
form
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
27a,
you
will
see
that
there
are
listed
there
credit
references
of
the
company,
whitney
national
bank,
hibernia
national
bank,
and
so
on.
international
milling
company.
these
are
credit
references
of
the
company
and
it
was
the
company's
credit
that
stood
behind
the
account.
you
will
also
see
from
that
application
form
that
it
notes
in--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well
technically,
the
individual
employees
were
jointly
liable
with
the
company
for
any
charges
on
their
particular
cards.
what
i
was
pointing
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
the
credit
checks
that
were
made
and
that
are
made,
for
company
cards,
look
to
the
company's
credit
worthiness
as
the
basis
for--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
no.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
it
could
have,
mr.
justice.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
it
does
not,
it
goes
after
the
company.
in
this
case,
the
record
reflects
that
all
the
bills
were
sent
to
the
company
at
the
company
address.
the
correspondence
relating
to
the
billing
error
inquiries
were
between
the
company
bookkeeper
and
american
express.
ordinarily,
with
these
accounts,
it
is
the
company
that
is
primarily
involved.
there
are--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--it
could
have.
it
could
have.
the
purpose
for
the
individual
liability
is
primarily
to
assure
the
company,
the
koerner
company,
in
this
case,
against
misuse
of
the
cards
by
their
employees.
there
are,
under
section
135
of
the
truth-in-lending
act,
where
you
have
a
business
card
system
where
ten
or
more
cards
are
issued...
that
wouldn't
have
applied
in
this
case...
but
where
there
are
ten
or
more
cards,
the
credit
card
issuer
and
the
company
getting
the
cards
are
allowed
by
contract
to
negotiate
between
themselves
any
division
of
liability
they
want
to
negotiate
without
regard
to
the
$50
limit
on
liability
for
unauthorized
use
of
credit
cards
that
would
otherwise
apply.
and
what
often
happens
in
these
company
card
situations
is
that
american
express
will
reach
an
agreement
with
the
company
that
will
allow
the
company,
in
the
case
of
an
employee
who
leaves
town
without
paying
his
bills,
the
company
will
inform
american
express,
cancel
the
card
and
then
american
express
will
go
after
the
employee
rather
than
the
company.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
no,
there
were
apparently
some
instances
where
personal
checks
of
the
employees
were
also
sent,
as
well
as
company
checks.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
that's
possible,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
record
does
not
reflect
that.
in
our
view,
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
case,
however.
the
question
is,
in
our
mind,
as
far
as
the
application
of
the
business
credit
exemption
is
concerned
is
whether
the
card
was
issued
for
a
business
purpose,
not
whether
it
was
used
for
a
business
purpose.
a
creditor
must
know
when
a
credit
card
is
opened,
whether
the
account
is
covered
by
the
truth-in-lending
act,
or
whether
it
is
exempt.
the
most
important
reason
is
found
in
section
127
of
the
truth-in-lending
act
which
requires
initial
disclosures
to
be
sent
to
all
cardholders
before
the
first
transaction
on
the
account.
so
you
have
to
send
out
these
initial
disclosures
before
any
charges
have
been
made
at
all.
and
the
creditor
has
to
know,
at
that
time,
whether
the
card
is
going
to
be
covered
by
the
act
and
therefore
the
disclosures
have
to
be
sent,
or
whether
it's
exempt.
and
the
federal
reserve
board
has
taken
precisely
this
position
in
its
newly
issued
regulation
z,
which
came
out
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
where
it,
in
its
new
definition
of
cardholder,
defines
a
cardholder
as
a
person
to
whom
a
card
is
issued
for
consumer
credit
purposes.
the
question
is
the
purpose
for
the
issuance
of
the
card,
it's
a
prospective
kind
of
test.
it's
very
similar
to
a
situation
outside
the
credit
card
area
where
you
might
have
a
loan
that's
taken
out
at
the
bank.
the
lender
at
the
time
the
loan
is
taken
out
must
make
the
decision
whether
of
the
truth-in-lending
disclosures.
and
he
hands
over
the
loan
proceeds
and
once
the
customer
leaves
the
bank
he
could
use
that
money
for
whatever
he
pleases.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
yes,
your
honor.
it
makes
the
initial
disclosures
before
the
first
use
of
the
card
and
then
american
express,
at
least,
makes
new
disclosures
each
year.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well
it
must
make
initial
disclosures
at
the
beginning--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--a
renewal
card
was
sent.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
there
are
disclosures.
i
don't
believe
they
are
required,
except
where
there's
a
change
in
terms.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
american
express
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
card
was
being
used
for,
or
whether
those
purchases
are
personal
or
business;
all
it
gets
are
copies
of
the
credit
card
slips
from
the
merchant.
they
can't
tell
whether
that's
a
personal
use
or
a
business
use;
it
has
to
rely
upon
the
representations
that
are
made
to
it
at
the
time
the
account
is
issued.
and
in
this
case,
the
application
form
which
mr.
koerner
signed
and
which
the
company
signed
as
well,
clearly
labels
the
application
as
one
for
a
company
account.
perhaps
i
could--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well,
that
may
not
indicate
that
the
charges
were
business
charges.
i,
for
example,
have
a
company
american
express
card
from
my
law
firm,
and
i
often
pay
for
the
charges
with
a
personal
check
and
then
receive
petty
cash
from
the
company,
from
the
law
firm,
in
reimbursement.
the
nature
of
the
payment
doesn't
necessarily
determine
the
issue.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
it's...
in
this
case,
there
is
a
contract,
your
honor.
there
is
a
contract
between
american
express--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--agreement.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
and
it's
a
matter
that
has
to
be
determined
at
the
outset,
before
the
account
is
used.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well
an
extension
of
credit--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--certainly
occurs
then.
i
wouldn't--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well,
the
definition
of
credit
contained
in
the
truth-in-lending
act
is
broad
enough
so
that
the
opening
of
an
account
has
to
be
viewed
as
an
extension
of
credit.
if
it
weren't--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well
certainly--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--an
extension
of
credit
is
the
right
to
defer
payment.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
yes,
and
that
constitutes
an
extension
of
credit.
for
example,
if
american
express
were
to
discriminate
against
someone
in
opening
accounts,
and
let's
say,
refused
to
open
accounts
for
women,
under
the
equal
credit
act,
the
refusal
to
open
an
account
for
a
woman
would
be
a
refusal
to
extend
credit
and
would
give
her
a
right
of
action.
the
opening
of
an
account
is...
has
to
be,
an
extension
of
credit.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
it
has
to
be
an
extension
of
credit;
i'm
not
denying
that
it's
used
for--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
i
think
that
language
is
crucial
to
us,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
indicates
clearly
that
you
can
have
extensions
of
credit
within
an
overall
transaction.
the
language
is,
transactions
involving
extensions
of
credit
for
business
or
commercial
purposes.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
precisely.
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
i
could
conceive
of
a
case,
your
honor,
where
if
someone
were
to
come
into
american
express
and
say,
two
years
later,
i
got
a
business
card
from
you
but
i'd
like
to
change
it
over
into
a
personal
card.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
i
would...
that
should
hardly
entitle
him
to--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--no,
it
wouldn't.
because
the
credit
transaction
here
was
a
business
credit
transaction.
i
should
point
out,
that
american
express
issues
two
kinds
of
cards:
it
issues
personal
cards,
and
those
are
the
vast
majority
of
all
cards
that
are
issued;
something
like
90
percent
of
the
cards.
and
it
issues
company,
or,
corporate
cards,
which
are
the
kinds
of
cards
involved
in
this
case.
now
mr.
koerner
individually,
could
have
applied
for
a
personal
card
on
a
different
application
form
and
he...
if
he
qualified
for
credit...
could
have
received
it.
and
then
he
would
have
received
all
of
the
disclosures
under
truth-in-lending,
and
all
of
the
protections.
if
he
did
not,
the
company
applied
for
a
business
account,
and
then
the
company
authorized
a
card
to
be
delivered
to
mr.
koerner
and
the
four
other
employees.
that
changes
the
nature
of
the
transaction.
the
company
name
was
on
the
card,
the
company
received
the
bills,
the
company's
credit
was
at
stake;
this
is
a
business
credit
transaction
and
the
agreement
between
american
express
and
the
company
makes
it
so.
perhaps,
if
i...
if
we
look
a
little
bit
at
the
particular
section
of
the
act
that
american
express
was
charged
with
violating,
you
will
see
why
an
account
can't
be
half
fish
and
half
fowl,
why
it
has
to
be
all
business
or
all
personal.
section
161
of
the
act
applies
only
to
open-end,
consumer
credit
plans,
that's
the
statutory
language.
now,
an
open-end
credit
plan
by
its
very
nature
involves
a
continual
flow
of
credit
extensions,
as
part
of
an
overall
credit
plan.
now,
a
creditor,
in
order
to
comply
with
the
fair
credit
billing
provisions,
has
to
set
up
a
complete
compliance
program
to
assure
that
the
statutory
deadlines,
that
are
set
in
section
161,
are
satisfied.
you
have
to
respond
within
30
days,
and
then
within
90
days
in
specific
ways,
and
you
have
to
conduct
certain
kinds
of
investigations
within
certain
time
periods.
the
creditor
has
to
set
up
these
procedures
for
a
category
of
account,
and
when
it
gets
an
inquiry
it
has
to
know
whether
to
assign
it
the
deadline
that
the
statute
requires
or
whether
not
to
assign
it
a
deadline.
the
inquiry,
the
credit
card
issuer
will
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
inquiry
relates
to
a
personal
charge
or
to
a
business
charge.
in
fact,
it
may
relate
to
no
charge
at
all,
it
may
be
a
use...
a
charge
that
appears
on
the
statement
where
the
cardholder
had
never
made
any
purchase.
it
might
just
be
an
error
on
the
bill.
or
it
might
be
one
of
the
statutory
definitions
of
the
billing
error
is
a
mistake
in
computation.
it
might
be
a
mistake
in
adding
up
a
number
of
charges,
some
of
which
were
business
and
some
of
which
were
personal.
so,
the
creditor
has
to
know,
to
comply
with
that
section,
whether
the
account
is
fish
or
fowl;
whether
it
is
business
or
personal.
and
in
this
case,
this
account
was
categorized
as
a
business
account.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
it's
very
similar,
your
honor;
that
would
involve
an
agreement
by
a
creditor
to
make
extensions
of
credit
in
the
future,
and
if
that
agreement
were
between
a
lender
and
a
business
debtor,
it
would
not
be
covered
by
truth-in-lending.
section
103(h)
of
the
act
confirms
this
reading.
that
section
defines
consumer,
and
consumer
credit
in
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act,
like
161
that
i
was
talking
about
a
moment
ago,
use
the
word
consumer.
now
section
103(h)
says
that
consumer
credit
is
credit
primarily
for
personal,
family
or
household
purposes.
it
has
the
word
primarily
in
it.
that,
in
our
view,
reflects
that
you
can
have
a
mixed
purpose
account,
and
that
the
creditor
has
to
make
a
judgment
at
the
outset,
admittedly
at
the
risk
of
making
a
mistake
and
then
being
liable
under
the
law.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
there
might
be,
and
i
don't--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--it
might
happen,
and
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
this
case
arises
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
put
in
the
record
the
application
forms,
it
is
admitted
through
discovery
that
all
billing
was
to
the
koerner
company
as
a
business
account,
that's
an
admission
of
the
plaintiff,
we
have
the
contract
in
the
record
which
says
it's
a
company
account,
and
the
plaintiff
put
in
no
evidence
indicating
that
this
was
to
be
a
personal
account.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
at
the
time
of
the
issuance.
i
assume
that
if
somebody
sent
in
the
same
company
card
application
form
that's
in
the
record
and
put
a
cover
letter
on
the
front
of
it,
saying
i
need
this
card
for
personal
purposes,
that
would
change
the
case
significantly.
but
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--if
that,
the
procedures
are
if
that
were
to
happen,
it
would
issue
a
personal
card,
which
as
i
said,
is
the
vast
majority
of
the
cards
that
american
express
issues.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
we
did,
mr.
justice--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well
of
course
it
does,
but
in
this
case,
we
put
in
the
evidence
that
i've
cited,
and
under
rule
56
the
plaintiff
was
required
to
come
in
with
any
affidavits
to
counter
that
that
were
required,
and
he
didn't
put
in
any.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
if
there
were
an
issue
of
material
fact,
but
we
don't
believe
there
is
an
issue
of
material
fact
because
of
the
explicit
agreement
among
the
three
involved
parties:
the
john
koerner
company,
louis
koerner
and
american
express
company,
a
contract
that
this
was
to
be
a
company
account
and
a
stipulation
during
discovery
that
all
billing
was
done
as
a
business
account.
we
think
that
that's
sufficient
to
support
summary
judgment.
summary
judgment
is
really
the
common
mode
of
proceeding
in
most
of
these
truth-in-lending
cases,
because
in
most
cases
the
issues
will
turn
on
a
construction
of
contractual
agreements
or
language
in
a
form,
and
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
cases
to
come
up
in
summary
judgment
contexts.
the
mourning
v.
family
publications
services,
inc.
case
that
this
court
decided
was
a
summary
judgment
case.
and
most
of
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
cases
are
summary
judgment
cases.
the
issue
is
one
of
construction
of
the
agreement
in
question.
i'd
like
just
to
mention
before
my
time
for
my
main
argument
is
concluded,
the
most
recent
actions
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
under
the
truth-in-lending
simplification
and
reform
act
of
1980,
the
federal
reserve
board
was
required
to
issue
by
april
1,
'81,
a
totally
revised
regulation
z.
and
it
did
that
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
the
crucial
sections
of
that
regulation.
that
new
regulation
is
now
in
effect,
and
governs
the
actions
of
creditors
at
this
time.
the
1980
statute
did
not
amend
any
of
the
sections
of
the
law
that
we've
been
talking
about
this
morning.
it
did,
however
require
the
new
regulation
and
in
the
new
regulation,
the
board,
in
its
commentary
on
the
sections
that
i've
set
forth
in
the
brief
notes,
and
we
have
the
quotation...
in
footnote
10,
on
page
9,
that
the
new
regulation
is
simply
an
interpretation
of
both
the
old
and
the
new
law
and
not
a
change
in
law.
and
that
new
regulation
follows
the
approach
that
i
outlined
this
morning,
it
talks
about
the
issuance
of
a
card
and
defines
whether
it's
a
business
or
a
consumer
card
by
the
purpose
for
which
the
card
is
issued.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
just
a
few
minor
points.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
from
american
express'
standpoint,
an
academic
dispute.
we
were
sued
for
half
a
million
dollars.
the
complaint
talked
about
10
million
or
something
like
that,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--it
will
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
certify
the
case
as
a
class
action.
if
it
is
certified
as
a
class
action,
then
under
section
130
of
the
truth-in-lending
act
there
are
statutory
damages
of
$500,000
for
the
class;
$500,000
or
one
percent
of
the
net
worth
of
the
creditor,
whichever
is
less.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
then
it
would
go
forward
as
an
individual
action,
as
to
mr.
koerner,
and
there
are
statutory
damages
there
of
$100.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
there
would
be
arguments
as
to
whether
the
$100
statutory
damages--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--would
preclude
such
other
damages.
so
we
were
in
this
case,
defending
it,
not
because
we
didn't
want
to
apologize
to
somebody,
but
because
we
were
sued
for
a
half
a
million
dollars.
now,
the
second--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well,
i
don't
know.
on
that
point,
mr.
koerner
said
that
it
was
undisputed
that
we
had
violated
the
law.
that's
not
entirely
correct.
this
case
arises
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
i
think
the
court
has
to
assume
that
if
the
act
applies
it
was
violated.
but
if
it
were
remanded
for
trial,
mr.
koerner
would
have
to
put
on
evidence
that
would
show
that
we
did
in
fact
violate
the
law,
that
there
was
a
dispute,
that
it
was
properly
sent
in,
there's
an
extremely
technical
definition
of
what
has
to
be
a
proper
written
notification
of
a
billing
error
and
whether
it
was
sent
in
within
the
statutory--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--i
believe
we
did.
we
moved
to
dismiss.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
i'll
check
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
it's
in
my
records.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
we
certainly
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
on
summary
judgment,
you
have
to
assume
the
facts.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
that's
not--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--that's
not
clear
at
all.
i
think
the
basic
problem
with
judge
wisdom's
contention
is
that
he
seems
to
equate
individual
liability
with
the
fact
that
you
have
a
consumer
credit
transaction
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
oh,
mr.
justice,
that
happens
all
the
time.
in
all...
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
it's
a
common
practice
for
creditors
to
require
individuals,
especially
in
cases
of
small
businesses,
new
businesses,
unincorporated
businesses,
to
assume
liability
for
business
debts.
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
well,
it
could
be
a
joint
liability.
that
happens
as
well.
oftentimes
in
the
case
of
a
new
business
with--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--yes.
we
made,
we
have
some
customers--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--no,
but
it
might
well
with
the
koerner
company.
certainly
with
u.s.
steel,
the
purpose
for
the
individual
liability
is
somewhat
different,
the
purpose
of
control
of
individual
employees'
expenditures
and
the
allocation
of
liability
as
among
the
card
issuer...
card
issuing
company
and
the
employee,--
mr.
ronald
j.
greene
--well,
you
might
assume
that,
but
in
this
case,
we
have
a
contract
that
says
that
it's
a
business
account,
and
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
