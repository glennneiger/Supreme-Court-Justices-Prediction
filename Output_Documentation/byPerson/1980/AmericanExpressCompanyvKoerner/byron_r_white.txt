justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
greene,
there
are...
do
you...
does
the
company
make
the
disclosures
every
time
it
issues
a
new
card,
every
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
must
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'm
asking
you
how
about
on
reissue?
when...
i
suppose
this
card
was
reissued
every
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
there
are
disclosures
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
a
card
like
this
is
never
used
for
business
purposes,
as
it
turns
out,
it's
used
completely
for
personal
use.
it
never...
and
the
employee
makes
the
payments
directly
to
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
every
payment...
the
payment
for
every
charge
on
the
card
is
made
by
him
personally,
and
not
by
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
isn't
the
purpose,
it's
what
somebody
says
the
purpose
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
your
theory
is.
it
isn't
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
matter
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--contractual
representation.
justice
white
even
if,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
false,
the
purpose
is
false?
in
the
sense
that
it's
never
used,
and--
justice
white
--well,
i
can
certainly
conceive
of
a
situation
where
someone
couldn't
get
a
card
of
his
own
but
he
could
get
one
with
the
company's
name
on
it
and
he
never
intended
to
use
it
for
business
purposes.
solely
personal.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
change
your
case.
justice
white
did
you
urge
it
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
but
you
didn't
want
to
apologize?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you...
you
answered,
i
suppose,
before
the
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
deny
the
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
all
right.
i
just
wanted
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
would
think
he
alleged
the
facts
and
that
you
either
denied
them
or
admitted
them?
