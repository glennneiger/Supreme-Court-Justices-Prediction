mr.
james
d.
weill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
supplemental
security
income
program
is
a
wholly
federal
program,
providing
public
assistance
benefits
to
indigent,
aged,
blind
and
disabled
people.
one
important
component
of
that
program
is
this
grant
of
$25
a
month
income
maintenance
for
those
people
who
reside
in
public
or
private
medical
institutions.
the
government
has
tried
to
characterize
the
program
as
excluding
residents
of
public
institutions
generally,
and
as
involving
no
discrimination
at
all
against
the
mentally
ill.
but
this
ignores
the
broad
grant
of
eligibility
to
virtually
all
aged,
blind
and
disabled
residents
of
medical
institutions
whether
public
or
private,
and
the
contrasting
special
exclusionary
rules
for
certain
mental
institution
residents.
the
framework
is
created
by
the
incorporation
of
the
receipt
of
medicaid
as
the
trigger
for
ssi
eligibility.
but
under
the
medicaid
statute,
virtually
all
residents
of
medical
institutions
get
medicaid.
that
includes
residents
of
hospitals,
including
specialty
hospitals
and
residents
of
hospitals
and
wards
treating
psychiatric
diseases.
it
includes
skilled
nursing
homes
and
intermediate
care
facilities;
medicaid
also
includes
people
over
65
and
under
22
in
mental
hospitals.
the
group
that
is
excluded
from
medicaid
is
the
group
of
persons
22
to
64
in
mental
hospitals.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that's
correct,
in
legion
v.
weinberger.
mr.
james
d.
weill
and
we
are
not
taking
issue
with
medicaid
exclusion.
in
legion,
the
court
locked
to
specific
reasons
that
congress
had
articulated
in
the
medicaid
exclusion,
that
it
felt
were
substantial
reasons.
and
we're
not
challenging
that
in
any
sense.
we're
looking
at
the
linkage
here,
to
ssi.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that's
right.
no
dispute.
but
it
is
appellees,
who
are
22
to
64,
and
in
public
mental
hospitals,
who
are
excluded
from
ssi
because
they
are
excluded
from
medicaid.
the
ssi
program,
let
me
first
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
nature
of
the
discrimination.
the
government
has
argued
that
this
doesn't
discriminate
at
all
against
the
mentally
ill.
we
agree
the
statute
discriminates
to
some
extent
among
mental
patients
as
well
as
against
mental
patients,
but
that
doesn't
alter
the
nature
of
the
case.
this
court
has
frequently
considered
cases
in
which
statutes
discriminated
both
among
and
against
women,
illegitimate
children,
and
aliens.
but
the
court
in
each
case
identified
the
discrimination...
the
discriminated
group,
as
aliens,
women
or
illegitimate
children.
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
medical
assistance
provisions
that
have
been
incorporated
into
ssi,
demonstrates
mental
health
status
of
appellees
plays
a
key
role
in
the
discrimination.
the
original
medical
assistance
provisions
excluded
persons
who
were
diagnosed
as
having
psychosis
and
being
treated
in
a
medical
institution
as
a
result
thereof.
those
provisions
have
been
narrowed
since
the
current
provision,
excludes
the
appellees
from
medicaid
because
they
reside
in
an
institution
for
mental
diseases.
and
it
is
this
exclusion
that
section
1611(e)(1)(b)
incorporates
into
the
ssi
statute.
thus,
the
secretary's
suggestion
that
mental
health
status
of
appellees
is
irrelevant
to
the
ssi
exclusion
is
incorrect.
the
$25
benefit
at
issue
here
is
in
some
senses
small
but
its
significance
to
the
appellees
is
great.
for
residents
of
a
mental
hospital,
as
for
residents
of
any
other
medical
institution,
the
$25
a
month
grant
represents
the
ability
to
obtain
the
rudiments
of
a
barely
decent
existence.
it's
used
to
purchase
personal
clothing,
eyeglasses,
articles
necessary
for
personal
care,
reading
material,
or
to
pay
the
costs
of
transportation
for
trips
when
they
are
permitted
by
the
hospital,
to
visit
relatives
or
friends,
or
to
participate
partially
in
the
life
of
the
society
outside
of
the
institution.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes.
by
definition,
the
members
of
the
class
are
indigent
and
eligible,
except
for
the
exclusion
caused
by
section
1611(e)(1).
mr.
james
d.
weill
it
demonstrates
that
the
appellees
needs
for
the
items
are
identical
and
appellees
are
identically
situated
vis
a
vis
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
the
people
who
are
receiving
the
benefits.
that's
all--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--that's
correct.
the
record
shows
that
and
the
government
doesn't
dispute
that.
mr.
james
d.
weill
it
was
congress
that
made
the
determination
that
medical
institutions,
by
and
large,
do
not
provide
these
items.
we
are
relying,
we
don't
have
affidavits
from
every
medical
institution
in
the
country
or
in
the
region,
but
we
are
relying
on
the
congressional
determination
that
institutions
meet
the
food,
shelter
and
medical
needs
of
recipients,
but
by
and
large,
do
not
meet
the
needs
for
these
types
of
items.
the
secretary
has
not
disputed
that.
mr.
schulder
suggested
that
the
new
york
brief,
amicus
brief,
indicates
that
new
york
does
make
a
grant
payment
of
this
sort.
i
disagree
with
his
reading
of
that
brief.
i
think
what
he's
referring
to
is
a
statement
in
the
brief
that
new
york
allows
people
who
have
income
from
other
sources
to
retain,
including
ssi,
to
retain
the
$25
or
comparable
amount,
for
these
possessions,
or
to
buy
these
items.
but
the
new
york
brief
does
not
say
that
new
york
itself
makes
a
grant
for
these
items.
so
appellees
have
been
denied
this
grant--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--new
york
is
on
our
side
of
the
case,
representing
the
interests
of
the
residents
of
its
mental
hospitals,
as
is
pennsylvania.
they
are
here
not,
not
necessarily
out
of
the
economic
interests
of
new
york
of
pennsylvania,
but
on
behalf
of
the
residents
of
their
mental
hospitals.
mr.
james
d.
weill
correct.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
it's
not
clear
to
what
extent
their
own
treasuries
are
bearing
any
of
the
responsibility
now.
mr.
james
d.
weill
now,
yes,
they
must
be
bearing
some
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
it's...
it
varies
from
institution
to
institution.
i
mean,
with
the
affidavits
and...
from
the
illinois
institutions
that
are
in
the
record,
describe
the
patients
begging
visitors
and
relatives
who
come
to
the
institution
for
money
to
buy
some
of
these
items.
the
institutions
in
illinois
that
they
reside
in
do
provide
institutional
clothing
for
them,
not
personal
clothing.
it
varies
from
institution
to
institution.
but
congress,
i
keep
returning
to
the
point
that
congress
has
made
a
determination
here
that
people
in
medical
institutions
need
this
grant.
congress
has
not
said
why
residents
of
mental
hospitals
aged
22
to
64
as
residents
of
medical
institutions,
don't
need
this
grant,
that
all
other
residents
of
medical
institutions
get,
assuming
that
they
are
aged,
blind,
disabled
and
indigent.
okay.
and
this
denial
has
occurred
not
only
without
the
slightest
suggestion
from
congress
of
a
reason
for
it,
but
the
secretary
has
also
not
articulated
any
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
unlike
many
of
the
public
assistance
cases
on
which
the
secretary
relies,
in
this
case
congress
did
not
differentiate
between
the
covered
group
and
the
uncovered
group
on
the
basis
of
a
judgment
of
differing
economic
need.
and
the
government
concedes
that
appellees
needs
for
ssi
are
the
same
as
that
of
other
residents
of
medical
institutions.
mr.
james
d.
weill
--that's
correct.
we're
not
making
a
statutory
argument;
we
are
challenging
the
statutory
exclusion.
but
congress,
all
that
the
legislative
history
says,
it's
not
directed
solely
to
people
in
medicaid
institutions,
but
it's
directed
generally
to
residents
of
medical
institutions.
for
residents
of
medical
institutions,
both
the
house
and
the
committee
reports
say,
"while
most
subsistence
needs
are
met
by
the
institution
and
therefore
full
ssi
benefits
are
not
needed,
some
payment
is
necessary
for
remaining
subsistence
needs
not
supplied
by
the
institution.
"
the
government
does
dispute
that
the
appellees
are
identically
situated
with
regard
to
this
determination
and
this
need.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
i
intend
to,
your
honor.
if
i
may
say
one
other
thing
first,
about
the
government's
rational
basis,
rationale.
because
we
do
believe
that
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
heightened
scrutiny
here,
that
the
exclusion
is
so
patently
irrational
that
the
court
can
strike
it
down
on
irrational
basis
grounds
without
reaching
heightened
scrutiny.
the
secretary's
sole
contention
is
that
congress
will
simply
say,
well
maybe
the
states
will
take
care
of
these
personal
needs
for
people
who
are
not
in
institutions
that
aren't
receiving
medicaid.
but
that
argument
is
flawed
in
several
respects.
first,
the
argument
is
simply
conclusory,
it's
merely
descriptive
of
the
statutory
result,
but
has
no
content
that's
related
to
a
function
of
the
ssi
program
or
the
medicaid
program,
or
any
other
concrete
concept
of
governmental
interest.
second,
it
misapprehends
the
nature
of
the
ssi
program.
congress
created
ssi
to
take
over
existing
state
income
maintenance
responsibilities,
in
part
because
of
the
inadequacies
of
the
prior
state
income
maintenance
programs.
ssi
dramatically
altered
the
previous
governmental
roles
and
responsibilities
for
providing
public
assistance
to
the
aged,
blind
or
disabled.
when
the
federal
government
has
created
a
federal
program,
like
ssi,
like
food
stamps,
like
social
security,
to
meet
a
perceived
need,
irrational
discrimination
in
that
program
between
similarly
situated
people
can't
be
justified.
and
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
it
can
be
justified
by
a
hypothesis
that
the
need
may
be
met
by
the
state.
that
approach
would
simply
subvert
the
congressional
determination,
like
the
one
here,
that
such
needs
were
not
being
met,
or
were
not
being
adequately
met,
or
should
be
part
of
a
federal
income
maintenance
program.
in
the
social
security,
illegitimacy
and
gender
discrimination
cases,
the
court
has
never
suggested
that
state
afdc
programs,
which
would
cover
illegitimate
children
or
women
and
children,
justify
exclusion
from
social
security.
the
same
is
true
with
the
food
stamp
cases
the
court
has
decided
on
constitutional
grounds,
moreno
and
murry.
traditional
state
assistance
roles
are
no
excuse
for
irrational
exclusion
in
federal
programs.
third,
the
federal
$25
grant
is
a
federal
grant
to
meet
a
congressionally
determined
element
of
need
for
people
in
medical
institutions
generally.
it's
not
simply
a
bonus
for
the
happenstance
of
eligibility
for
medicaid
programs.
as
the
secretary
agrees,
the
needs
of
appellees
exist,
regardless
of
whether
medicaid
subsidizes
the
state's
cost
for
institutional
care.
but
the
government's
argument
ignores
the
congressional
determination
of
purpose
and
the
importance
of
the
ssi
benefit
itself,
and
the
importance
of
the
federal
role
on
income
maintenance.
congress
found
this
to
be
an
unmet
need.
there
is
no
indication
that
any
state,
including
new
york,
provides
such
a
grant
to
meet
these
needs;
medicaid
is
withheld
in
part
because
states
are
not
meeting
the
needs
of
mental
hospital
residents,
that's
why
congress
originally
did
not
give
the
appellees
medicaid
and
we
do
not
dispute
that.
but
to
withhold
the
federal
ssi
personal
needs
grant,
because
congress
didn't
want
to
subsidize
the
inadequate
state
medical
care
for
appellees,
turns
rationality
on
its
head
and
merely
penalizes
the
mental
patients
for
the
inadequacies
of
the
states.
the
secretary's
argument
also
assumes,
incorrectly,
that
there
is
an
absolute
consistent
link
between
medicaid
and
ssi
eligibility.
and
there
is
not.
there
are
groups
of
residents
of
institutions,
including
medical
institutions,
that
get
ssi
even
though
they
don't
get
medicaid.
that
includes
residents
of
private
mental
hospitals
aged
22
to
64,
includes
residents
of
educational
and
vocational
schools,
and
residents
of
public
non-medical
institutions
with
fewer
than
16
residents.
all
these
groups
get
ssi
benefits,
and
not
medicaid.
the
government--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--the
person
might
have
medicare
paying
part
of
the
bill,
there
are
some
people
eligible
for
medicare
but
not
social
security.
or
there
may
be
contributions
from
a
church
group
or
some
other
governmental
contribution
from
the
state.
under
the
ssi
rules,
in
that
situation,
i
believe
that
church
and
governmental
contributions
to
the
cost
of
care
are
not
considered
income
to
the
person.
mr.
james
d.
weill
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says.
and
i
don't
believe
they
would
necessarily
be
rare.
mr.
james
d.
weill
rare.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well
it's
not
a
situation
that
normally
arises,
it
would
depend
on
the
structure
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
james
d.
weill
in
that
situation
there's
no
violation
of
equal
protection.
mr.
james
d.
weill
if
there
were
a
statute
that
said
anybody
could
work
on
a
federal
dam
except...
they
had
to
be
employed
or
be
a
contractor
for
a
federal
dam,
except
women,
or
except
blacks,
or
except
persons
who
were
in
a
mental
institution
within
the
last
ten
years;
that
raises
equal
protection
questions.
there's
an
entitlement
there
and
an
exclusion
from
that
entitlement.
not
all
federal
programs,
funding
programs,
create
the
types
of
entitlement
that
social
security
and
ssi
do.
and
in
certain
circumstances,
some
exclusions
from
those
entitlements
are
subject
to
equal
protection...
become
equal
protection
violations.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that's
correct.
but
they
are
excluded
on
the
basis
of
a
factor
that's
irrelevant,
not
only
to
the
primary
purposes
of
the
program,
but
to
any
governmental
interests
at
all.
and
this
court
has
consistently
said,
in
entitlement
programs,
that
an
exclusion
has
to
have
a
rational
basis
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
the
government
here
has
not
come
up
with
any
legitimate
governmental
interests,
except
the
conclusory
one
that
i
just
mentioned,
that's
inconsistent--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--that's
inconsistent
with
the
program.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well
that's
never
been
held
by
this
court.
the
mere
desire
not
to
make
a
group
eligible--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--pardon
me.
i
believe
there
are
two
questions
there.
the
fiscal
considerations
that
are
involved
have
never
alone
been
held
by
this
court
to
constitute
a
rational
basis.
we
discussed
that
in
the
motion
to
affirm.
the
government
here
has
not
pressed
the
fiscal
ground;
i
would
add
that
the
30...
in
answer
to
the
first
question,
mr.
schulder,
the
30
million
dollar
estimate
is
an
estimate
that
the
government
made
of
what
the
cost
would
be
if
every
mental
patient
in
a
public
hospital
aged
22
to
64
in
the
country
got
ssi.
there
are
about
100,000
such
persons,
if
each
person
got
it
each
month
that
would
be
about
30
million
dollars.
the
government
conceded
that
that
estimate
did
not
discount
for
all
the
various
other
factors
that
would
go
into
reducing
that
figure:
some
of
those
people
aren't
disabled,
some
of
them
have
outside
income
and
resources,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
mr.
james
d.
weill
pardon?
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
i
was
just
answering
the
previous
question.
the
amount
of
the
money,
unless
the
amount
is
tremendous,
as
was
a
factor
in
medicaid
exclusion,
where
it
came
to
billions
of
dollars
a
year,
money
alone
has
not
been
a
basis
for
upholding
an
otherwise
invidious,
discriminatory
classification.
and
as
far
as
the
rationale
that
congress
just
didn't
want
to
give
it
to
this
group,
that's
not
a
rationale
that
the
court
has
accepted.
in
moreno,
the
court
said
that
a
bare
congressional
desire
to
harm
is
not
a
legitimate
governmental
interest--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--well,
the
things
like
line-drawing
as
i
understand
it,
are
elements
that
go
into
why
this
court
gives
some
deference
to
legislative
judgments,
because
the
legislature
has
to
draw
lines.
mr.
james
d.
weill
a
great
deal
of
deference.
but
that
does
not
make
line-drawing
itself
a
rational
basis
for
an
exclusion.
there
has
to
be
something
beyond
just
the
fact
that,
oh
well,
congress
drew
the
line
there.
well,
in
dandridge,
the
court
said
that
classifications
don't
have
to
be
imperfect.
and
several
months
later
in
moreno,
the
court
said
well,
this
classification
like
that
in
dandridge,
is
not
only
imperfect,
it
has
no
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
classifications
are
not
valid
because
they
are
imperfect.
mr.
james
d.
weill
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
james
d.
weill
the
legislative,
both
the
house
and
the
committee
reports
are
both...
provide
not
only
no
reason
for
the
exclusion,
they
provide
no
basis
for
suggesting
that
congress
understood
that
the
exclusion
was
occurring.
mr.
james
d.
weill
while
the
court,
the
court
could
certainly
look
beyond
what
congress
says,
in
identifying
a
rational
basis
for
discrimination,
if
there
is
one,
there
are
situations
where
legislative
silence
or
confusion
simply
reinforced
the
conclusion
that
the
discrimination
is
not
a
product
or
any
rational
congressional
scheme.
that's...
the
court
said
that
in
schlesinger
and
johnson
v.
robison,
and
the
illinois
state
board
of
elections
commissioner's
case.
here,
you
just
can't
tell
what
congress
was
doing,
what
it
would
have
said
to
justify
the
denial
of
the
grant,
and
contrary
to
the
government's
rather
offhand
argument,
appellees
are
in
no
political
situation
to
seek
relief
from
congress.
they
can't
vote,
and
it
is
evident
from
the
ssi
history
and
the
medicaid
history,
that
congress
has
frequently
noted
the
inability
of
the
mentally
ill
to
obtain
equal
amount
of
discriminatory
treatment
from
congress
because
they
can't
vote.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
the
median
stay
is
41
days,
but
voting
disqualifications
don't
necessarily
relate
in
most
states,
simply
to
being
in
an
institution.
most
states
disqualify
people
who
have
been
found
incompetent
or
have
been
found
insane
or
have
been
committed,
until
there
is
a
restoration
of
rights.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
some
of
them
might
eventually,
although,
by
that
point
they
have
presumably
moved
on
to
other
interests.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--none
of
any
significance,
that
i
know
of.
the
lack
of
a
vote
for
people
in
institutions
and
for
the
people
who
have
been
labelled
mentally
ill,
generally,
by
the
state,
is
in
part
why,
if
the
court
finds
the
discrimination
survives
the
rational
basis
test,
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
heightened
scrutiny.
the
criteria
the
court
has
used
to
invoke
heightened
scrutiny
establishes
propriety
to
discrimination
against
the
mentally
ill.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
we
are
arguing
that
the
court
can
and
should
first
invalidate
the
statute
under
the
rational
basis
test.
if
the
court
finds
that
the
statute
meets
the
rational
basis
test,
then
it
is
appropriate
to
strike
down
the
statute
under
the
heightened
scrutiny
standard,
akin
to
that
applied
by
the
district
court.
we
are
not
asking
for
strict
scrutiny,
we're
asking
for
a
form
of
heightened
scrutiny,
somewhat
like
that
applied
in
craig
v.
boren.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well
that's--
mr.
james
d.
weill
--the
district
court
used
the
phrase
quasi-heightened
scrutiny,
in
wengler
this
court
used
the
phrase
heightened
scrutiny,
and
i'll
stick
with
this
court's
phrase
of
heightened
scrutiny.
importance
of
political
powerlessness,
not
just
not
having
a
vote,
but
being
confined
in
institutions,
being
stigmatized,
and
having
lack
of
political
power
escalate
because
of
the
relationship
between
these
factors,
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
for
many
years.
it
was
recognized
as
early
as
yick
wo
v.
hopkins,
and
this
court
has
since
indicated
in
cases
like
ratzenbach
v.
morgan,
that
non-discriminatory
treatment
in
governmental
services
is
normally
secured
by
the
franchise.
when
political
powerlessness
is
exacerbated
by
insularity,
they
have
usually
become,
perhaps,
the
crucial
indicia
of
heightened
scrutiny.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
i
don't.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no.
minorities
exist
in
many
forms
in
our
society.
on
any
political
issue
there
is
a
minority
which
may
be
small,
but
if
that
minority
can
vote
and
participate
and
it's
not
stigmatized,
it
can
trade
in
the
legislative
marketplace.
a
minority
that
cannot
vote
and
that
is
stigmatized
cannot
do
that,
and
they
are
so
totally
shut
out,
so
they
are
not
like
the
minority
of
50,000
ophthalmologists
in
the
lee
optical...
this
is
a
different
type
of
minority
of
50,000
people.
it's
precisely
like
the
aliens.
aliens
cannot
vote,
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
given
heightened
scrutiny
to
discriminations
against
aliens
are
precisely
applicable
here.
aliens
can't
vote,
their
situation
is
not
immutable,
since
they
become
citizens.
but
the
voting
factor
and
historical
discrimination
and
the
stigma,
have
been
the
crucial
factors
that
have
led
this
court
to
give
heightened
scrutiny
to
aliens.
thank
you.
