justice
rehnquist
this
court
has
never
held
that
mental
illness
is
a
suspect
classification,
has
it?
justice
rehnquist
well
that's
pretty
much
the
boren
test,
i
guess,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well
if
congress
inadvertently
enacts
a
piece
of
legislation,
does
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
has
the...
the
benefit
that
goes
with
the
receiving
of
the
$25
a
month
got
to
do
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
but
not,
you
can't
rule
out
the
fact
that
if
they
got
in
from
the
federal
government,
their
own
treasuries
wouldn't
have
to
bear
any
of
the
cognate
responsibilities?
justice
rehnquist
but
surely
you
don't
deny
that
the
congressional
statutory
scheme
as
written
has
the
effect
that
the
only
way
your
clients
can
get
the
money
is
to
hold
it
unconstitutional?
justice
rehnquist
no,
we
don't
deny
that.
the
statute
has
that
effect,
legislative
history
does
not
describe
the
statute
as
it
passed,
we
believe.
there
is--
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
don't
have
legislative
history,
you
have
legislation
which
prevents
it?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
they
were
virtually
identical
and
congress
simply
chose
to
spend
its
money
on
the
one
in
utah
rather
than
the
one
in
wyoming?
justice
rehnquist
well
why
is
there
in
yours?
justice
rehnquist
what
sort
of
entitlement
is
it
that
you
say
congress
has
created
here,
since,
as
i
understood
it,
reading
the
statute
as
written,
your
class
is
clearly
excluded?
justice
rehnquist
well--
justice
rehnquist
--they
don't
want
to
pay
out
the
money?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
about
the
dandridge
case?
justice
rehnquist
not
a
desire
to
harm,
that
was
a
withholding
of
food
stamps,
as
i
recall,
from
people
whom
it
was
felt,
congress
felt,
shouldn't
have
food
stamps.
this
may
just
as
well
be
a
desire
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
as
to
how
much
we're
going
to
fund
into
these
programs.
justice
rehnquist
well
presumably,
we
give
a
great
deal
of
deference.
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you--
--on
the
question
of
economy,
isn't
it
true
that
the
record
is
not
clear
that
there
was
any
legislative
interest
in
that.
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
that's
right.
justice
rehnquist
well
if
the
government
is
right
about
the
average
stay
in
a
private
mental
institution
being
41
days,
one
would
think
that
many
people
who
have
been
in
private
mental
institutions,
are
capable
and
eligible
to
vote
if
they
wish
to
vote,
in
most
elections.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
all
of
these
people
who
are
denied
benefits
will
never
again
be
allowed
to
vote?
justice
rehnquist
well,
and
if
they
were
sufficiently
offended
by
the
congressional
classification,
wouldn't
they
register
their
protest
in
the
ballot
box?
