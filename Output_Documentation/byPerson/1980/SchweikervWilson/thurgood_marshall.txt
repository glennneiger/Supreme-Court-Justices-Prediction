well,
mr.
schulder,
if
you
admit
people
to
schools
you
can't
discriminate,
can
you?
so
if
you
let
them
in
this
program,
how
can
you
discriminate
against
them
after
you
admit
them,
and
say
that
we're
not
discriminating,
because
we
did
admit
them.
justice
marshall
aren't
you
saying
we
didn't
discriminate
as
much?
justice
marshall
i
thought
you
said
that
the
reason
that
was
not
discriminatory
was
because
they
did
recognize
them
in
one
instance?
justice
marshall
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
that
and
the
school.
you
say
okay,
we're
not
discriminating,
we'll
let
you
in
the
school,
but
we
will
educate
you
in
the
basement.
justice
marshall
to
put
it
more
precisely
we'll
let
you
in
the
school,
but
you
can't
get
the
$25
that
everybody
else
gets.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
marshall
who
are
not
mentally
ill?
justice
marshall
do
you
have
any
information
that
any
of
them
are
organized?
justice
marshall
any
insane
people...
do
you
know
of
any
organizations
of
insane
people?
