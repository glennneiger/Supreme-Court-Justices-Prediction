justice

in
total
dollars,
how
much
are
we
talking
about,
any
idea?
justice
blackmun
overall,
overall
to
the
government;
how
much
annually?
justice
blackmun
annually.
justice
blackmun
incidentally,
appellee
wilson
is
no
longer
in
the
case,
is
he?
justice
blackmun
mr.
schulder,
let
me
go
at
it
another
committed
to
public
mental
hospitals.
suppose
you're
wrong
about
the
type
of
classifcation
this
is.
and
if
it
is
one
that
is
based
in
part
on
age,
that
isn't
the
end
of
your
case
is
it?
justice
blackmun
i
was
wondering
whether
you're
bogging
down
on
the
first
point.
i'd
like
to
hear
about
the
rest
of
it.
justice
blackmun
so
in
your
view
then,
the
record
shows
that
people
in
public
mental
institutions
do
not
receive
similar
items?
justice
blackmun
no,
i
didn't
say
the
same
$25,
but
i
meant
similar
care
provided
by
the
institution.
justice
blackmun
well
on
that
basis,
why
is
new
york
on
your
side
of
the
case?
justice
blackmun
just
some
good
charitable,
generous
approach?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
is
formally
harris,
secretary
against
wilson
and
now,
schweiker
secretary
against
wilson
comes
to
us
by
way
of
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
supplemental
security
income
program
which
is
part
of
the
social
security
program
provides
a
subsistence
allowance
to
the
needy
aged,
and
blind,
and
disabled
persons.
inmates
of
public
institutions
however
generally
are
excluded
from
this
program.
but
there
is
an
exception
to
this
exclusion
and
that
under
the
act
a
reduced
amount
of
ssi
benefits
amounting
to
comfort
money
is
provided
to
and
otherwise
eligible
person
in
the
facility
that
receives
medicaid
funds
for
his
care.
the
appellees
reside
in
public
mental
institutions
that
do
not
receive
medicaid
funds
for
their
care.
they
brought
this
class
action
in
federal
court
challenging
their
exclusion
from
the
reduced
ssi
benefits.
the
district
court
held
that
the
exclusion
was
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
the
ground
that
the
classification
had
no
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislation.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reversed
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
appellees'
rights
to
equal
protection
were
not
violated
by
the
denial
of
ssi
benefits.
congress
made
an
acceptable
distinction
not
between
the
mentally
ill,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
nonmentally
ill
in
the
other,
but
between
residence
in
public
institutions
receiving
medicaid
funds
and
those
in
institutions
not
receiving
such
funds.
the
classification
is
to
be
judged
under
the
rational-basis
standard
and
this
does
not
allow
us
to
substitute
our
personal
notions
of
good
public
policy
for
those
of
the
congress.
it
was
not
irrational
for
congress
to
elect,
in
view
of
budgetary
constrains
to
shoulder
only
part
of
the
burden
of
supplying
this
comfort
money
allowance,
leaving
to
the
states
the
primary
responsibility
for
making
the
allowance
to
those
who
reside
in
state-run
institutions.
i
am
authorized
to
say
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he's
joined
therein
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall
and
stevens.
