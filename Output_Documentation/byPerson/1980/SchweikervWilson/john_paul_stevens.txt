mr.
schulder,
could
i
just
ask
one
question--
justice
stevens
--following
up
on
what
justice
blackmun
said,
in
computing
the
30
million
dollars,
do
you
just
take
the
number
of
persons
in
mental
institutions
who,
and
multiply
that
by
the
$25
figure,
is
that
how
you
do
it?
it's
an
awful
lot
of
people
if
you
are
up
to
30
million
dollars.
or
is
there
any
other
cost,
other
than
the
$25,
in
arriving--
justice
stevens
--can
you
translate
the
30
million
to
the
number
of
persons?
do
you
know
how
many
people
are...
have
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case?
well,
don't
try
to...
if
you
don't
have
it,
then
okay.
justice
stevens
i
have
some
difficulty
following
that
argument.
supposing
that
they
said
you
are
eligible
for
ssi,
one
ground
would
be
mental
illness,
but
then
they
said,
however,
mentally
ill
people
get
half
the
benefits
everybody
else
gets.
they
would
get
in
because
they
are
mentally
ill,
but
then
they
only
get
a
lesser
benefit.
couldn't
they
then
still
claim
the
classification
was
based
on
mental
illness?
justice
stevens
but
i'm
just,
i'm
just
directing
my
question
at
your
point
that
because
they
get
initial
eligibility
by
reason
of
mental
illness,
therefore
nothing
else
done
by
reason
of
mental
illness
can
be
based
on
mental
illness.
justice
stevens
--do
i
correctly
understand
that
if
congress
did
fund
the
mental
institution
program
with
medicaid,
that
the
government
would
concede
that
they
could
not
constitutionally
deny
the
mental
patients
the
$25?
justice
stevens
i
understand
the
statute
would
take
care
of
it,
but
assume
that
they
have
adopted
a
plan...
with
an
amendment
that
provided
federal
funding
for
mental
institutions
and
for
these
mental
patients,
but
nevertheless,
retained
the
exclusion
of
the
$25
for
these
people...
as
i
understand
your
argument,
that
would
be
unconstitutional
and
irrational.
justice
stevens
yes.
so
you
rest
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
funding
is
provided
by
the
states
exclusively
without
any
federal
support?
justice
stevens
and
does
that
mean
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
state
is
given
the
equivalent
of
$25,
or
just
the
mere
fact
that
because
it's
a
different
source
of
funding,
we
don't
care
whether
they
get
the
$25?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
why
new
york
is
against
you,
here.
they
want
to
be
relieved.
justice
stevens
mr.
weill,
i
am
puzzled
by
the
private
mental
institution.
how
could
someone
be
a
resident
of
a
private
mental
institution,
and
be
able
to
afford
a
private
mental
institution
and
also
be
on
ssi?
justice
stevens
i
see.
those
would
probably
be
fairly
rare,
though,
i
mean
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
tell
us--
