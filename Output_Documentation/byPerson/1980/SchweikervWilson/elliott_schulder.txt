mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
question
presented
is
whether
section
1611(e)(1)
of
the
social
security
act
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment's
due
process
clause
by
excluding
from
certain
public
assistance
benefits
under
the
supplemental
security
income
program
otherwise
eligible
individuals
who
are
residents
of
public
institutions
and
whose
care
and
treatment
are
not
funded
under
the
medicaid
program.
in
order
to
gain
a
proper
understanding
of
this
question,
it
is
necessary
to
explore
the
interaction
of
medicaid
and
ssi
statutes
that
give
rise
to
the
equal
protection
issue
here.
under
medicaid,
the
federal
government
provides
financial
assistance
to
those
states
that
choose
to
reimburse
certain
costs
of
medical
treatment
for
needy
persons.
the
medicaid
program
generally
covers
in-patient
and
out-patient
care
for
physical
and
mental
illnesses,
but
it
excludes
coverage
for
treatment
of
persons
aged
21
through
64,
in
an
institution
for
treatment
of
tuberculosis
or
mental
diseases.
since
appellees
are
between
21
and
64
years
of
age
and
are
patients
in
mental
institutions,
their
treatment
is
not
funded
under
medicaid.
the
validity
of
the
medicaid
mental
institution
exclusion
was
upheld
in
this
court's
summary
affirmance
in
legion
v.
richardson,
and
appellees
do
not
challenge
their
exclusion
from
medicaid
coverage
in
this
litigation.
under
the
ssi
program,
which
was
in
effect
on
january
1st,
1974,
the
federal
government
provides
monthly
cash
assistance
to
indigent,
aged,
blind
and
disabled
persons.
a
person
is
considered
disabled
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
if
he
is
unable
to
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
any
medically
determinable
physical
or
mental
impairment.
currently
a
standard
ssi
benefit
amounts
to
$238
per
month.
in
section--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--in
terms
of
the
particular
benefit
at
issue
here,
while
we've
stated--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--we've
stated
the
figure
would
be
in
the
vicinity
of
30
million
dollars,
although
it's
difficult
to
compute
it
with--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--precision.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
the
only
two
appellees...
the
only
two
named
appellees
who
are
still
in
the
case
are
appellee
simmons
and
turney.
but
the
case
was
certified
by
the
district
court
as
a
class
action.
section
1611(e)(1)
of
the
statute
at
issue
here
provides
that
an
otherwise
eligible
person
who
resides
in
a
public
institution
is
ineligible
for
full
ssi
benefits.
mr.
elliott
schulder
surely.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
that's
the
only
cost
that
was
considered
here,
but
it
was
done
on
a,
i
believe,
a
nationwide
basis.
the
class
that
was
certified
in
this
case
is
limited
to
one
of
the
regions
that's
covered
by
the
social
security
administration.
mr.
elliott
schulder
as
i
was
saying,
section
1611(e)(1),
the
statute
at
issue
here
provides
for
an
exclusion
from
ssi
benefits
generally,
of
all
persons
who
are
residents
in
public
institutions.
however,
the
statute
provides
that
a
small,
$25
a
month
benefit
for
"comfort
items"
to
those
individuals
who
reside
in
a
medical
facility
which
is
receiving
a
payment
under
the
medicaid
program
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
their
care
and
treatment.
the
purpose
of
this
reduced
monthly
benefit,
as
expressed
in
the
legislative
history,
is
to
allow
the
recipient
to
purchase
small
comfort
items,
such
as
magazines,
stationery
or
clothing,
not
supplied
by
the
institution.
the
statute,
the
statutory
exclusion
and
exemption
at
issue
here
has
the
effect
of
denying
ssi
payments
to
all
residents
of
public
institutions
whose
treatment,
for
whatever
reason,
is
not
funded
under
medicaid.
because
of
their
exclusion
from
medicaid,
persons
between
21
and
64
years
of
age
who
reside
in
public
mental
institutions
are
not
eligible
for
the
reduced
ssi
benefit.
appellees
are
indigent
individuals
between
21
and
64
years
of
age,
who
are
disabled
by
reason
of
mental
impairment.
they
thus
satisfy
the
general
eligibility
requirements
for
ssi.
however,
because
appellees
are
hospitalized
in
public
mental
institutions,
under
the
operation
of
section
1611(e)(1)
they
are
ineligible
for
ssi
benefits.
they
are
ineligible
for
the
full
ssi
benefit,
because
they
are
housed
in
a
public
institution.
and
they
also
do
not
receive
the
reduced
benefit
for
comfort
items
because
their
treatment
in
a
mental
institution
is
not
funded
under
the
medicaid
program.
appellees
brought
this
lawsuit
for
declaratory
relief
on
april...
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
section
1611(e)(1)
on
equal
protection
grounds.
district
court,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
certified
the
case
as
a
class
action
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
appellees.
the
district
court
first
concluded
that
the
statute
invidiously
discriminates
against
the
mentally
ill,
it
then
determined
that
classifications
based
on
mental
illness
are
sufficiently
similar
to
suspect
classifications,
such
as
race
or
natural
origin
to
require
a
stricter
standard
of
review
than
is
normally
applicable
in
reviewing
social
welfare
legislation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
actually
what
the
district
court
held
in
this
case
was
that
mental
illness
was
a
quasi-suspect
classification
and
thus
entitled
to
an
intermediate
or
heightened
level
of
scrutiny.
the
only
two
federal
courts
of
which
i
am
aware,
that
have
specifically
addressed
the
question,
have
held
that
mentally
ill
individuals...
or
classifications,
are
not
entitled
to
any
kind
of
heightened
or
strict
scrutiny.
we
have
cited
those
in
our
brief.
the
district
court
ruled
in
this
case
that
mental
health
classifications
must
serve
important
governmental
interests
and
must
be
substantially
related
to
achievement
of
those
objectives.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
the
court
held
that
the
statute
in
this
case
failed
to
pass
muster
under
this
heightened
standard.
in
addition,
the
court
expressed
the
view
that
the
statute
appeared
to
be
an
accidental
by-product
of
the
legislature
rather
than
a
deliberate
means
of
serving
a
legislative
end.
the
case
here
presents
a
problem
of
line-drawing
in
enactment
of
social
welfare
legislation.
in
enacting
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
here,
congress
drew
the
line
at
providing
ssi
benefits
to
public
institution
residents
whose
treatment
was
partially
funded
by
the
federal
government
under
the
medicaid
program,
while
leaving
it
to
the
states
and
local
governments
to
provide
for
the
comfort
needs
of
public
institution
residents
whose
care
was
wholly
funded
by
state
and
local
government
sources.
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
rationally
based
on
considerations
of
conserving
economic
resources
and
of
respect
for
the
responsibilities
of
state
and
local
governments
for
caring
for
those
who
are
within...
caring
for
the
comfort
needs
of
those
within
public
institutions
that
are
wholly
funded
by
those
local
governments.
the
district
court,
however,
held
that
the
classification
at
issue
here
is
based
on
mental
health.
we
submit
that
the
court's
conclusion
that
this
statute
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
mental
health,
is
incorrect,
and
in
fact
the
court's
conclusion
that
the
statute
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
mental
health
ignores
the
fact
that
individuals
such
as
appellees,
who
are
disabled
by
reason
of
mental
impairment
are
included
within
the
ssi
program
in
the
first
place,
precisely
because
their
mental
condition
is
severe
enough
to
warrant...
to
constitute
a
disability,
and
to
warrant
benefits
under
the
ssi
program.
appellees
arguments
and
the
conclusions
of
the
district
court,
therefore,
rest
and
fall
on
this
tortology.
moreover,
it
is
important
in
this
case
to
focus
on
precisely
what
kind
of--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--but
that's
not
the
classification
at
issue
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
may
be
true,
that
merely
because
a
class
of
people
are
included
within
the
statute
initially
and
then
not
given
equal
treatment
with
other
beneficiaries,
that
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
statute
did
not
discriminate
against
them.
but
one
of
the
points
that
we
are
trying
to
make
here
is
that
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
statute
invidiously
discriminates
against
them
and
the
court's
ascribing
some
kind
of
antipathetic
attitude
on
the
part
of
congress
toward
the
mentally
ill,
simply
is
unfounded
in
the
context
of
a
statute
that
singles
out
people
who
are
mentally
impaired
for
special
treatment
and
inclusion
in
the
program
in
the
first
instance.
and
in
fact,
the
statutory
exclusion
at
issue
here
does
not
exclude
the
mentally
ill
across
the
board;
in
fact,
there
are
large
numbers
of
mentally
ill
individuals
who
do
qualify
for
the
reduced
ssi
benefit.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we're
not--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no.
because
the
specific
statutory
exclusion
that
we're
dealing
with
here
does
not
single
out
any
one
group
of
individuals.
it
draws
a
bright
line
between
those
public
institution
residents
who
are
receiving
medicaid
funding
for
their
care
and
treatment
and
those
who
are
not.
it's
not
based
in
terms
of
mental
illness
or
even
residence
in
a
mental
institution.
the
line
that
was
drawn
here
is
based
on
a
neutral
factor
of
medicaid
eligibility
versus
non-medicaid
eligibility.
we
submit
that
that
distinction
only
has
to
serve
a
rational
basis
and
that
the
rational
basis
is
present
to
uphold
the
statutory
distinction
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
but
as
i
explained
in
answering
mr.
justice
stevens'
question,
we're
not
saying
that--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
what
we're
saying
is,
that
the
district
court's
finding--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
this
legislative
scheme
does
not
manifest
or
reflect
any
kind
of
antipathetic
attitude
on
the
part
of
congress
toward
the
mentally
ill.
it
draws
the
line
at
which
some
mentally
ill
are
excluded
and
some
people
who
are
not
mentally
ill
are
excluded.
and
these
people
are
excluded
for
reasons
wholly
unrelated
to
their
mental
health
status.
and
it
includes
people
who
happen
to
be
mentally
ill,
and
it
includes
other
individuals.
also
in
that
regard--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
but
who
may
be
disabled
for
other
reasons
and
who
reside
in
public
institutions,
and
whose
treatment
is
covered
under
medicaid.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
it
certainly
would
not
be.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
would
argue
that
if
the
ssi
exclusionary
provision
is
read
together
with
the
medicaid
eligibility
provision
that
sprecifically
applies
to
the
appellees,
the
only
factors
that
are
really
at
issue
here
are
age
and
presence
in
a
public
mental
institution.
and
we
submit
that
niether
of
these
two
factors
requires
a
heightened
level
of
scrutiny.
first
of
all,
this
court
held
in
massachussettes
retirement
board
versus
mergy
and
vance
versus
bradley
that
age
isn't
a
factor
that
requires
heightened
scrutiny.
as
to
presence
in
public
mental
institutions,
the
fact
that
certain
indivduals
have
to
go
to
a
public
mental
institution
because
of
indigency
does
not
require
heightened
scrutiney
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
harris
versus
mccray.
indigency
is
not
a
factor
that
calls
for
any
heightened
judicial
review.
similarly,
presence
in
a
public
mental
institution
is
not
an
immutable
condition
determend
by
accent
of
birth.
some
of
appelleees,
as
the
record
points
out,
were
voluntarily
committed
to
public
mental
hospitals.
in
fact,
appellees
brief
points
out
on
page
28,
footnote
12,
that
the
medium
length
of
stay
in
a
mental
hospital
is
41
days.
on
the
basis
of
that
bit
of
evidence,
we
submit
that
presence
in
a
mental
institution
certainly
is
not
an
immutable
characteristic.
and
third,
the
political
powerlessness
of
public
mental
institution
residents
is
based,
at
least
in
part,
on
legitimate
considerations
that
these
people
are
simply
unable
to
contribute
equally
to
the
political
process.
this
is
not
a
factor
like
sex
or
race,
where
disparate
treatment
is
not
a
function
of
ability,
but
is
simply
a
function
of
stereotyped
views
and
discriminatory
treatment.
it's
more
like
the
factors
of
intelligence
or
physical
disability
that
were
discussed
in
the
plurality
opinion
of
frontiero.
because
the
statute
does
not
discriminate
against
the
suspect
or
quasi-suspect
group,
we
submit
that
it
need
only
have
a
rational
basis
to
pass
muster.
as
we've
shown
in
our
brief,
the
statute
meets
this
test.
congress
could
limit
benefits
to
those
it
was
already
helping
under
other
programs,
such
as
the
medicaid
program
here,
and
it
could
determine
that
the
needs
of
these...
of
others
who
are
not
covered
under
medicaid
should
continue
to
be
met
by
the
states.
now,
appellees
argue
that
the
same
reasons
that
support
the
medicaid
exclusion
that
was
upheld
in
legion
do
not
support
the
ssi
exclusion
here.
but
we
do
not
argue
that
precisely
the
same
reasons
support
both
exclusions;
medicaid
and
ssi
are
two
separate
programs.
in
enacting
the
statutory
exclusion
here,
congress
was
painting
with
a
broad
brush
and
was
not
limiting
the
exclusion
to
those
within
a
particular
medicaid
eligibility
provision
at
issue
in
legion.
the
line
in
this
case
is
one
between
public
institution
residents
whose
treatment
is
funded
by
medicaid,
and
those
whose
treatment
is
not
funded
by
medicaid.
to
say
that
congress
had
to
consider
a
separate--
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
under
the
operation
of
the
statute--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
believe
it
probably
would
be
and
we
would--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
think
the
latter
would
be
the
proper
consideration,
although
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
states
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
point
out
that...
at
least,
the
state
of
new
york
does
provide
this
type
of
benefit
out
of
its
own
funds.
i'm
not
sure
whether
other
states
similarly
provide
for
this
benefit.
in
sum,
our
submission
is--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
our
position
in
a
nutshell
is
that
at
least
where
a
statutory
distinction
is
based
on
a
neutral
factor
such
as
medicaid
eligibility,
the
classification
should
be
judged
on
its
own
terms
and
not
in
terms
of
the
specific
impact
on
the
various
subgroups
that
happen
to
be
affected
by
it.
finally,
we
submit
that
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
the
district
court,
the
statute
here
is
not
the
product
of
congressional
inadvertence.
in
the
same
legislative
package
that
contained
the
ssi
provision
at
issue
here,
congress
also
provided
for
expanding
medicaid
to
include
coverage
of
those
under
21.
congress
also
considered,
and
rejected
in
conference,
a
proposal
to
set
up
demonstrations
projects
to
study
the
feasibility
of
expanding
medicaid
coverage
to
those
mental
institution
residents
between
the
ages
of
21
and
64.
the
brief
of
the
private
psychiatric
hospital
association
supports
us
in
our
contention
that
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
and
knew
the
impact
of
what
it
was
doing
when
it
enacted
the
statute
at
issue
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
not
necessarily,
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
the
next
thing
i
was
about
to
say
was
that
if
appellees
have
any
problem
with
the
statute
and
believe
that
congress
did
inadvertently
exclude
them,
then
their
remedy
is
with
congress
and
not
with
the
courts.
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
here
and
we
have
stated
in
our
briefs,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
time
remaining.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
would
just
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
mr.
weill's
argument
that
section
1611(e)(1)
is
inconsistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
ssi
program.
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit,
in
its
opinion
in

deals
with
this
specific
objection.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case
refers
to
the
legislative
history
as
indicating
that
congress
considered
efficient
and
an
economical
method
of
providing
ssi
assistance
as
one
of
the
important
factors
that
it
was
taking
into
consideration
in
structuring
the
ssi
program.
and
the
secretary
has
also
interpreted
this
provision
as
reflecting
congressional
intent
to
prevent
the
shift
of
public
institutional
programs
which
are
traditionally
the
responsibility
of
state
and
local
governments,
to
the
federal
government.
thank
you.
