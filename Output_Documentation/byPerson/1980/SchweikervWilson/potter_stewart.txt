there
are
a
large
number
of
non-mentally
ill
people
who
do
not.
justice
stewart
did
i
correctly
understand
mr.
schulder
to
tell
us
that
the
court
has,
through
summary
affirmance
upheld
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
medicaid?
justice
stewart
okay.
justice
stewart
right.
so...
but
you're
proceeding
on
the
premise
that
the
medicaid
exclusions
are
valid?
justice
stewart
--necessarily
be
what?
justice
stewart
rare.
well,
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
federal
program
that
simply
doles
out
federal
money
on
a...
basis
of
perceived
need,
do
you
think
that
your
analysis
can
be
carried
over
so
that
a
corps
of
engineers
dam
approved
in
utah
and
a
corps
of
engineers
dam
disapproved
in
wyoming
would
leave
wyoming
to
have
a
right
to
claim
in
this
court
that
the
wyoming
dam
should
have
been
funded
rather
than
the
utah
dam?
