we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
lehman
v.
nakshian.
mr.
kneedler,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
express
in
tort
claims
act,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
this
a
suit
at
common
law
in
the
traditional
terms?
was
there
a
suit
at
common
law
against
the
united
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
one
step
removed,
you
suggest,
from
the
usual
post-events
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
years
removed
would
this
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mrs.
barry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
the
kind
of
an
action
that
existed
at
the
time
the
seventh
amendment
was
adopted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
that
case
involve
a
situation
with
sovereign
immunity
being
waived?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
think
that
makes
some
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
mrs.
barry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue,
mrs.
barry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
it
makes
any
difference
whether
they
express
that
view
as
members
of
congress,
later
members
of
congress,
or
future
members
of
congress,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
order
to
do
that,
the
best
way
would
be
to
take
a
poll
of
the
congress,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
those
cases
involve
the
surrender
of
sovereign
immunity
by
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
was
it
imposed
on
them
from
the
outside?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested
this
morning,
they
know
what
words
to
use
the
other
way
too,
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
in
saying
what
they
mean,
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
has
done
it
both
ways
in
different
settings,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
