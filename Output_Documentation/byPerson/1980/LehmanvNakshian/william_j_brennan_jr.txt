justice
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
government's
position
anyway
is
that
yit
has
to
be
explicit,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
you
can't
find
it
by
implication?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kneedler,
as
i
recall
it,
lorillard
emphasized
legal
relief
in
7(c),
didn't
it,
as
a
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
jury
trial
was
intended
there.
the
words
15(c),
don't
they?
justice
jr.
and
i
notice
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
a
number
of
senators
and
congressmen,
or
all
they
all
congressmen?
justice
jr.
all
congressmen.
they
seem
to
think
that
they
meant
by
legal
relief
to
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
jury
trial.
it
doesn't
say
whether
they
voted
on
this
bill
or
not.
i
don't
find
that.
justice
jr.
even
when
there
were
that
many?
justice
jr.
quite
a
few
of
these,
i
think,
were
there.
claude
pepper,
for
example.
