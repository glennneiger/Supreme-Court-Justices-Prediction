mr.
kneedler,
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
distinguish
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
the
federal
tort
claims
act
provides
for
suits
against
the
government
but
does
not
allow
jury
trials.
justice
rehnquist
it
could
be
implicit
even
among
private
parties,
as
in
parklane
hosiery.
justice
rehnquist
you
could
turn
that
argument
around,
could
you
not,
and
say
that
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
it
knew
how
to
bar
the
right
to
jury
trials
and
when
it
has
not
done
so
there
is
a
right
to
jury
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rule
38,
by
its
terms,
certainly...
at
least
the
copy
i
have,
is
maybe
outdated...
doesn't
expressly
bar
a
jury
trial
in
a
claim
against
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
doesn't
the
seventh
amendment
come
into
play?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
that
38
simply
doesn't
apply
to
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
curtis
v.
loether
and
the
other,
the
district
of
columbia
case
and
the
7th
circuit
case
where
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
wasn't
given
by
statute,
but
this
court
found
it
was
given
by
the
seventh
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
pfitsch
turn
almost
entirely
on
the
court
in
which
the
case
is
authorized
to
be
brought?
doesn't
justice
brandeis's
opinion
there
say,
since
congress
authorized
suit
to
be
brought
in
the
district
court,
and
in
district
court
you
get
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
said
so
in
so
many
words,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
barry,
i
suppose
there
was
no
lever
act,
as
involved
in
the
pfitsch
case,
at
common
law
in
1791?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
barry,
you
can
see
our
difficulty
with
the
case
is
that
it
would
have
been
so
easily
resolved
by
congress
if
it
had
said
there
will
be
a
right
to
jury
trial
or
there
won't
be
a
right
to
jury
trial.
and
here
we're
left
with
a
kind
of
fuzzy
legislative
history
and
implications
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
point
was
that
congress
in
'46
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
when
it
had
not
been
around
at
all,
so
to
speak,
found
itself
perfectly
able
to
say,
there
shall
be
no
right
of
jury
trial.
and
it
could
have
gone
one
way
or
the
other
in
this
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
also
a
standard
principle
that
the
government
waives
its
sovereign
immunity
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
stated
by
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
the
collector
was
the
defendant
rather
than
the
united
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
the
reason
assigned,
at
any
rate,
even
though
it
was
concededly
artificial
or
antiquated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
louis
xiv
say
about
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
l'etat,
c'est
moi.
