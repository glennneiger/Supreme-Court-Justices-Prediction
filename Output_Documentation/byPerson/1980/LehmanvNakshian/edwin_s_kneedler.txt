mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
congress
has
granted
a
statutory
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
suits
against
the
federal
government
under
section
15(c)
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
that
act
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
in
employment
by
private
employers
as
well
as
by
the
federal
government
and
state
and
local
governments.
the
first
14
sections
of
the
act
contain
the
substantive
and
remedial
provisions
generally
applicable
to
private
employers
and
to
state
and
local
governments.
section
7
of
the
act
deems
age
discrimination
by
these
employers
to
be
violations
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
provides
for
enforcement
in
accordance
with
powers,
remedies,
and
procedures
contained
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
section
7(c)
then
authorizes
a
person
aggrieved
by
age
discrimination
by
private
employers
and
state
and
local
governments
to
bring
civil
action
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
for
appropriate
equitable
or
legal
relief.
section
7(c)
expressly
provides
for
trial
by
jury
in
suits
under
that
section.
the
united
states
is
expressly
excluded
from
the
definition
of
the
term
14
sections
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
instead,
age
discrimination
in
federal
employment
is
separately
addressed
in
section
15.
for
example,
subsection
(a)
of
section
15
states
a
distinct
substantive
prohibition
providing
that
all
personnel
actions
in
the
federal
government
are
to
be
made
free
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age.
subsection
(b)
then
empowers
the
civil
service
commission,
now
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
after
the
reorganization
plan,
to
enforce
this
prohibition
through
appropriate
remedies
including
reinstatement
or
hiring
with
or
without
back
pay.
section
15(c)
then
authorizes
a
person
aggrieved
by
employment
discrimination
in
the
federal
sector
to
bring
a
civil
action
in
any
federal
district
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
for
appropriate
legal
or
equitable
relief.
section
15(c),
unlike
section
7(c)
applicable
to
the
other
employers,
does
not
contain
an
express
grant
of
the
jury
trial
right.
respondent
brought
this
action
under
the
age
discrimination
act
in
1978,
alleging
discrimination
by
the
secretary
of
navy
and
certain
subordinate
officials.
according
to
the
complaint,
respondent's
permanent
position
was
abolished
in
1975
and
she
worked
for
the
next
three
years
in
another
position
on
a
continuing
but
temporary
basis.
she
alleged
that
officials
of
the
department
had
denied
her
reassignment
and
promotional
opportunities
on
the
basis
of
age
during
that
three-year
period.
to
remedy
that
alleged
discrimination
she
sought
in
this
case
a
retroactive
promotion
as
well
as
an
award
of
back
pay
measured
by
the
difference
between
what
she
actually
earned
and
what
she
would
have
earned
in
the
department
of
the
navy
in
the
absence
of
the
alleged
discrimination.
respondent
demanded
a
jury
trial
on
her
age
discrimination
claim.
the
government
moved
to
strike
that
demand
for
a
jury
trial.
the
district
court
denied
the
government's
motion
to
strike
concluding
that
congress
intended
to
permit
jury
trials
against
the
federal
government
under
section
15.
the
district
court
did
however
certify
the
jury
trial
issue
for
interlocutory
appeal
under
28
usc
1292(b).
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
petition
for
interlocutory
review.
the
court
of
appeals
observed
that
the
seventh
amendment
guarantee
of
trial
by
jury
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
that
guarantee
does
not
apply
in
suits
against
the
federal
government.
the
court
of
appeals
also
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
explicit
statutory
grant
of
the
jury
trial
right
in
section
15.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
a
right
to
jury
trial
could
be
inferred
in
section
15.
it
relied
on
two
factors.
first,
it
concluded
that
the
jury
trial
right
could
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
congress
had
provided
for
these
suits
against
the
federal
government
to
be
brought
in
federal
district
court
rather
than
in
the
court
of
claims.
second,
the
court
found
this
inference
from
the
federal
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
federal
district
courts
to
be
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
section
15
authorizes
the
court
to
award
legal
or
equitable
relief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
i
recall,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
address
the
question
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes,
what...
this
is
now
codified
in
28
united
states
code
2402,
that
suits
against
the
federal
government
under
1346
are
to
be
tried
without
a
jury
with
one
exception,
that's
in
tax
refund
suits.
but
the
origin
of
that
prohibition
is
in
the
tucker
act
of
1887
and
in
the
original
tucker
act
one
house
of
congress
had
provided
that
jury
trials,
had
permanently
authorized
jury
trials
in
those
claims
that
were
brought
in
district
courts
at
that
time
and
as
well
in
the
circuit
courts,
and
that
one
house
had
expressly
granted
it,
the
other
house
had
expressly
prohibited
it.
so
that
it's
not
surprising
that
in
resolving
the
disagreement
between
the
two
houses
that
congress
expressly
resolved
it
and
barred
jury
trials
in
suits
under
the
tucker
act.
in
fact,
we
believe
that's
strongly
indicative
of
congress's
intent
in
these
matters.
when
its
attention
was
actually
focused
on
the
question,
it
resolved
the
question
against
the
availability
of
jury
trial.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
there
was
not.
no,
in
that
sense,
no.
it
was
not.
this
court
held
a
hundred
years
ago
in
the
mcelrath
decision
that
the
seventh
amendment
has
no
application
in
suits
against
the
sovereign
because
suits
against
the
sovereign
were
unknown
at
common
law
or
at
the
very
least,
if
they
could
be
analogized
to
common
law,
it
could
not
have
been
asserted
that
the
jury
trial
right
that
was
preserved
in
the
seventh
amendment
contemplated
a
jury
trial
right
against
the
federal
government.
so
it
is
not
a
suit
at
common
law.
just
to
complete
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
tort
claims
act
congress
simply
picked
up
the
bar
to
jury
trials
that
was
contained
in
the
tucker
act
and
decided
to
incorporate
it
in
the
tort
claims
act,
and
in
fact
in
consideration
of
the
tort
claims
bill
in
1940
in
the
house
there
was
a
proposal
to
amend
the
bill
to
allow
jury
trials
and
that
was
defeated,
again
by
reference
to
the
tucker
act.
so
the
provisions
barring
jury
trials
in
our
view
reflect
that
when
congress
focuses
on
the
question
it
decides
it
does
not
want
jury
trials.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
plainly
erred
in
finding
the
jury
trial
right
in
section
15
of
the
age
discrimination
act.
as
i
pointed
out,
these
suits
are
not
suits
covered
by
the
seventh
amendment.
respondent
concedes
as
much
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held.
accordingly,
there
can
be
no
right
to
jury
trial
unless
congress
has
affirmatively
recognized
that
right.
respondent
concedes
this
as
well,
and
in
fact
this
conclusion
is
compelled
by
rule
38(a)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
under
rule
38(a)
where
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
apply
there
is
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
any
civil
action
brought
in
federal
district
court
except
as
given
by
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
in
the
text,
the
legislative
history,
or
the
background
of
section
15
of
the
age
discrimination
act
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
grant
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
suits
against
the
federal
government.
to
the
contrary,
all
the
indicia
of
congressional
intent
point
in
the
opposite
direction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
our
position
is
that
it
does
have
to
be
explicit
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's
correct.
a
right
to...
of
course,
in
a
suit
between
private
parties
where
the
seventh
amendment
applies.
right;
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct;
yes.
we're
not
addressing
the
question
of
suits
against
private
parties,
nor
where
the
seventh
amendment
applies,
or,
for
instance,
the
application
of
principles
of
collateral
estoppel.
well,
in
looking
at
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
it's
a
bivens-type
action,
then
that
is
a
suit,
that
would
be
a
suit
while
arising
out
of
his
official
duties,
it's
a
suit
in
his
personal
capacity.
when
an
officer
is
personally
liable
under
no
situation
is
it
our
understanding
that
the
seventh
amendment
itself
would
guarantee
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct
it
would
be
deemed
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
which
would
invoke
all
normal
rules
as
if
the
united
states
were
the
injured
party.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
in
looking
at
the
congressional
intent
under
section
15
we
must
of
course
start
with
the
language
of
the
act
itself.
as
i
mentioned
before,
section
15(c)
contains
no
reference
to
jury
trials.
section
7(c)
on
the
other
hand,
which
applies
to
civil
actions
brought
against
all
other
employers
covered
by
the
act,
expressly
provides
for
jury
trials.
therefore,
congress
has
demonstrated
in
the
very
statute
that's
under
consideration
here
that
it
knows
how
to
provide
for
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
when
it
wants
to
do
so,
and
yet
declined
to
grant
that
right
in
suits
against
the
federal
government.
under
settled
principles
of
statutory
constructions,
then,
we
submit,
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
is
that
there
is
to
such
right
under
section
15(c).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
under
rule
38
certainly
now
the
question
we
believe
has
to
be
whether
congress
affirmatively
granted
it,
granted
the
right,
because
rule
38
provides
for
trial
by
jury
guaranteed
by
the
seventh
amendment,
whereas
given
by
an
act
of
congress
the
mere
absence
of
a
prohibition
does
not
in
our
view
constitute
the
grant
of
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
particularly
when
considered
against
the
background
of
congress's
general
practice
of
not
granting
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
in,
for
instance,
the
complete
range
of
cases
subject
to
the
tucker
act,
which
includes
all
monetary
claims
under
the
constitution
under
any
statute,
under
any
contract,
and
all
claims
for
liquidated
or
unliquidated
damages
sounding
in
tort.
that
is
a
broad
jurisdictional
grant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
enacted
in
1946.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
adopted,
i
believe,
in
1937
or
1938.
but,
as
i
say,
the
committee
reports
on
the
tort
claims
act
do
not
really
discuss
the
question.
for
instance,
in
my
quick
looking
at
them,
there
was
no
reference
to
the
fact
that
if
we
don't
prohibit
it,
it's
granted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
it
simply
picked
up
the
preexisting
provision
in
the
tucker
act
because
the
last
phrase
that
i
quoted
was
from
the
tucker
act,
referred
to
suits
for
liquidated
or
unliquidated
damages
not
sounding
in
tort,
and
congress
in
the
tort
claims
act
was
effectively
filling
a
gap
in
the
tucker
act
and
so
it
was
natural
that
it
would
also
invoke
the
jury
trial
prohibition,
but
i
don't
think
any
inference
can
be
drawn
that
it
thought
it
had
to
prohibit--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
they
do,
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
in
lorillard
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
emphasized
the
use
of
the
word
"legal"
by
reference
to
its
accepted
connotation
under
the
seventh
amendment.
the
court
stated
that
in
suits
for
legal
relief,
when
legal
issues
are
to
be
decided,
the
seventh
amendment
ordinarily
requires
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
the
court
then
concluded
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
this
interpretation
and
intended
that
when
it
used
the
word
"legal"
to
receive
into
the
age
act
the
jury
trial
right
that
ordinarily
attaches
because
of
the
seventh
amendment.
that
analysis,
we
submit,
has
no
application
here,
because
the
seventh
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
suits
against
the
federal
government,
and
therefore
by
using
the
word
"legal"
congress
could
not
be
expected
to
have
attached
any
significance
to
it
for
jury
trial
purposes.
in
fact,
again,
against
the
background
of
the
tort
claims
act
and
the
tucker
act,
even
in
suits
that
are
concededly
of
a
type
that
would
entitle
a
private
party
to
a
jury
trial,
congress
has
established
a
different
rule
for
suits
against
the
federal
government
and
it's
consistent
with
this
practice
for
congress
not
to
have
affirmatively
provided
a
jury
trial
right
in
suits
against
the
federal
government
under
the
age
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
they're
all
congressmen;
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
didn't
trace
whether
each
of
them
did.
i
think
it's
a
familiar
principle,
though,
that
the
views
of
individual
members
post-enactment,
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
particular--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
would
submit
that
it
is.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
this...
the
act
was
extended
to
the
federal
goverment
in
1974
so
this
would
be
six
years,
seven
years.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
congressman
pepper
certainly
was
in
office--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
it
does
say,
in
the
basic
provisions
dealing
with
jury
trials,
that
there
should
be
a
right
to
jury
trial
as
guaranteed
by
the
seventh
amendment
or
as
given
by
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
absent...
if
a
party
does
not
fall
into
one
of
those
two
categories,
then...
or
if
a
case
does
not,
then
it
would
seem
a
party
to
that
case
does
not
have
a
right
to
demand
a
jury
trial.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
a
suit
against
the
federal
government?
i
mean,
in
a
suit
against
a
private
party
it
certainly
would
and
you
wouldn't
even
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
an
act
of
congress
had
granted
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
if
the
suit
is
one
that
falls
under
the
seventh
amendment
guarantee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
it
does
apply,
but
what
it
requires
is
that
you
find,
not
that
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
federal
government,
so
that
part
of
the
jury
trial
right
that's
preserved
in
rule
38(a)
does
not
apply
to
the
federal
government.
but
if
congress
affirmatively
grants
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
a
suit
against
the
federal
government,
then
that
comes
in
under
the
second
provision
in
rule
38(a)
that
there's
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
as
given
by
a
statute
of
the
united
states.
so,
in
that
sense,
rule
38
certainly
does
apply.
it
just
requires
you
to
look
outside
of
rule
38
to
some
statutes
to
find
an
affirmative
grant
of
jury
trial.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct;
yes.
but
those
cases
would
have
no
application
here
because
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
apply
to
suits
against
the
united
states.
we're
only
speaking
of
suits
against
the
united
states,
in
which
it
has
been
settled
by
this
court
that
there's
no
right
given
by
the
seventh
amendment
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that's
basically
correct.
the
only
reason
i
mention
it
is
because
the
case
that
seems
to
be
principally
relied
upon
for
the
proposition
that
providing
for
suits
to
be
brought
in
federal
district
court
implies
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
against
the
united
states
was
a
case
by
the
name
of
united
states
v.
pfitsch,
which
is,
for
instance,
the
only
authority
cited
in
the
moore
treatise
for
that
proposition.
but
pfitsch
arise
prior
to
the
adoption
of
rule
38
and
its
analysis
was
not
really
that
the
lever
act,
which
was
the
statute
involved
in
that
case,
itself
contained
a
grant
of
the
jury
trial
right.
it
seemed
to
be
more
that
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
district
court
jurisdiction
that
provided
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
and
we
think
it's
clear,
whatever
the
rule
would
have
been
before
the
adoption
of
rule
38(a),
that
there
is
no
general
inherent
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
civil
actions
in
federal
district
court,
that
rule
38(a)
establishes
a
mechanism
for
determining
when
there
is
such
a
right,
and,
namely,
whether
the
seventh
amendment
applies,
or
you
have
to
look
to
the
statute
for
a
grant
of
the
jury
trial
right.
and
so,
to
that
extent
i
think
that
whatever
the
application
of
pfitsch
may
have
been
at
a
prior
time,
rule
38(a)
requires
that
you
look
to
a
statute.
aside
from
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
which
as
i
mentioned
distinguishes
on
its
face
suits
against
the
federal
government,
i
think
it's
also
significant
that
there's
not
one
mention
in
the
legislative
history
of
a
reference
to
trial
by
jury
in
suits
against
the
federal
government.
this
is...
we
think
this
silence
is
particularly
telling
against
the
general
practice
of
congress
not
providing
for
jury
trials
in
those
case.
indeed,
the
most
recent
situation
of
which
we
are
aware
in
which
congress
has
actually
granted
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
in
tax
refund
suits
against
the
federal
government
brought
in
federal
district
court.
congress
affirmatively
granted
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
such
suits
in
1954.
but
the
house,
at
that
time,
for
example,
viewed
this
as
a
harmful
precedent
if
congress
was
going
to
provide
for
jury
trial
in
suits
against
the
federal
government
generally,
and
the
house's
resistance
was
sufficiently
strong
that
it
held
up
the
reporting
out
of
the
conference
committee
of
a
bill
authorizing
jury
trials
for
almost
a
year.
the
house
finally
acceded
to
the
provision
in
the
senate
bill
because
of
special
situations
involved
in
tax
refund
suits.
we
think
that
this
demonstrates
that
when
congress
focuses
on
the
question,
at
the
very
least
it
generates
controversy
within
the
congress,
and
surely
if
congress
had
intended
to
depart
from
its
normal
practice
in
the
age
discrimination
act
we
would
expect
some
debate
on
it,
instead
we
have
silence.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that's
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
but
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
indicia
of
legislative
intent,
if
we
look
beyond
the
face
of
the
statute,
which
we
submit
isn't
even
necessary
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
dispositive.
i
do
think,
though,
that
the
background
against
which
congress
legislates
in
this
area
is
at
least
of
some
relevance.
and
i
also
think
that
the
manner
in
which
congress
created
a
separate
section
15
also
reinforces
that
conclusion.
when
the
age
discrimination
act
was
extended
to
federal
employees
in
1974,
there
was
initially
a
proposal
to
bring
federal
employees
in
under
the
provisions
of
the
first
14
sections
of
the
act,
which
incorporate
the
fair
labor
standards
act
procedures.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
primary
basis
of
this
court's
holding
in
lorillard,
finding
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
under
section
7,
was
the
incorporation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
procedures.
but
when
congress
finally
enacted
the
1974
amendments,
it
did
not
bring
the
federal
government
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
procedures.
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
congress
instead
enacted
a
separate
section
15
which
was
not
patterned
after
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
doesn't
incorporate
those
enforcement
procedures.
it's
instead
patterned
after
title
vii,
after
section
717
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
prohibits
other
types
of
discrimination
in
federal
employment,
and
that
selection
of
the
title
vii
model
for
federal
employees
rather
than
the
fair
labor
standards
act
model,
is
doubly
pertinent
on
the
jury
trial
question.
in
other
words,
not
only
did
congress
reject
the
fair
labor
standards
act
model,
upon
which
this
court
had
relied
in
lorillard,
subsequently
relied;
it
adopted
the
title
vii
model
and
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
has
not
been
recognized
in
suits
brought
under
title
vii,
even
against
private
employers.
so
that
the
only
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
way
in
which
congress
structured
section
15
is
that
it
did
not
intend
for
there
to
be
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
and
this
inference
drawn
from
the
manner
in
which
section
15
was
formulated
in
1974
was
only
strengthened
in
1978,
we
submit,
when
congress
amended
the
statute
in
a
number
of
respects.
first,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
it
was
in
1978
that
congress
amended
section
7
to
provide
for
the
jury
trial
right
in
suits
under
that
section
and
didn't
under
section
15.
beyond
that,
congress
enacted
a
new
subsection
(f)
in
section
15
dealing
with
federal
employment,
which
provides
that
personnel
actions
in
the
federal
sector
are
not
to
be
subject
to
or
affected
by
any
other
provision
of
the
act
except
one
provision
in
section
12
dealing
with
the
upper
age
limit
for
federal
employees.
and
the
conference
report
states
that
this
new
subsection
(f)
makes
clear
that
section
15
is
independent
of
any
other
provision
of
the
act.
subsection
(f)
and
the
jury
trial
provision
in
private
sector
cases
were
both
considered
by
the
conference
committee.
they
were
both
enacted
by
the
congress
and
we
submit
that
given
this
reminder,
very
vivid
reminder
in
the
new
subsection
(f),
that
section
15
is
entirely
separate
and
does
not
incorporate
the
types
of
procedures
and
remedies
that
are
available
in
suits
against
private
employers
under
section
7.
given
that
reminder
that
it's
separate,
the
fact
that
congress
enacted
a
jury
trial
right
under
section
7
and
not
under
section
15,
we
again
think
is
very
telling
because
it
could
not
have
overlooked,
given
the
separate
nature
of
these
provisions,
it
could
not
have
overlooked
the
need
to
amend
section
15
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
are
several
things
about
pfitsch.
one,
congress
had
focused
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
it
had
considered
a
provision
to
have
these
cases
brought
under
the
tucker
act
and
rejected
it.
and
the
court
could
conceive
of
no
rational
ground
for
doing
this
except
to
provide
for
jury
trial
rights
so
the
rationale
of
pfitsch
is
the
congress
focused
on
the
question,
but
beyond
that,
as
i
mentioned,
pfitsch
also
seems
to
depend
on
the
notion
that
there
is
something
inherent
in
district
court
jurisdiction,
not
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
granted
a
right,
but
there
was
a
right
that
somehow
attached
because
the
case
was
brought
in
federal
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
it
says,
it
said
that
the
trial
would
be
according
to
the
ordinary
procedures
of
suits
of
law
in
federal
district
court.
now,
since
pfitsch
was
decided
under
rule
38(a),
one
of
the
ordinary
procedures
is
that
there
is
not
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
unless
the
seventh
amendment
applies
or
the
jury
trial
right
is
granted
by
a
statute
of
congress.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
one
explanation
for
this
is
that
at
the
time
pfitsch
was
decided
there
was
the
former
28
united
states
code
770
which
provided
a
statutory
right
for
trial
by
jury
in
suits
at
law
in
the
federal
district
courts.
this
was
repealed
in
1948,
so
it's
conceivable
that
in
pfitsch
the
court
was
relying
on
that
statutory
ground.
but
that,
as
i
say,
that
general
statutory
provision
was
repealed
in
1948.
it
was
essentially
unnecessary
because
the
seventh
amendment,
in
large
effect
it
then
implemented
the
seventh
amendment.
it
was
contained
in
the
original
judiciary
act
of
1789.
but
rule
38
made
it
largely
unnecessary
because
rule
38
expressly
itself
protects
the
jury
trial
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
could,
please.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
quick
point.
i'd
just
like
to
emphasize
that
in
1978
when
congress
affirmatively
granted
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
suits
under
section
7(c),
and
did
not
do
so
under
section
15(c),
it
also
enacted
the
new
subsection
(f)
which
says,
"any
personnel
action
of
a
federal
department
shall
not
be
subject
to
or
affected
by
any
provision
of
this
act.
"
at
section
12,
dealing
with
the
upper
age
limitation.
given
this
reminder,
and
codified
expression
of
congressional
intent
in
the
statute,
that
section
15
is
distinct
from
section
7,
we
submit
that
congress
could
not
have
been
under
the
impression
that
the
same
rule
would
be
applied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
mr.
justice
stewart--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
of
course,
there
is
a
standard
statute
of
limitations
provisions
for
suits
against
the
government
under
28
united
states
code
2401,
for
suits
against
the
government
generally.
insofar
as
she
was
suggesting
that
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
wouldn't
apply--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--section
15--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
that's
true,
but
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
new
subsection
accomplished
anything
that
wasn't
in
the
statute
before.
all
it
did
was
reiterate
what
was
implicit
in
the
structure
of
the
statute,
because
subsection
(f)
contained
separate
substantive
provisions.
there's
no
need
to
refer
back
to
the
other
provisions
that
contain
separate
remedial
and
enforcement
provisions,
and
separate...
authorizes
the
civil
service
commission
with
a
separate
authority
to
fashion
bona
fide
occupational
qualifications.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
is
the
correct
conclusion,
that
congress
deliberately
chose
to
do
that;
yes.
