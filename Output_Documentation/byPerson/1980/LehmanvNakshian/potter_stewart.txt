justice
stewart
but
the
reason,
it
has
to
be
explicit
when
it's
an
action
against
the
united
states
government.
justice
stewart
that's
the
only
time
in
your
argument
that
it
has
to
be
explicit.
justice
stewart
and
the
doctrine
coming
from
ex
parte
young
was
only
in
equity,
it
wasn't
a
suit
for
damages?
justice
stewart
was
rule
38
or
its
predecessor,
did
it
say
the
same
thing
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
stewart
in
'46
or
'47,
i
think.
justice
stewart
well,
under
your
argument,
congress
didn't
need
to
provide,
explicitly
provide
what
it
did
provide?
justice
stewart
that
kind
of
argument
is
pretty
well
foreclosed
by
what
we
said
in
the
last
term
in
the
ppg
opinion,
isn't
it?
you
can't
require
congress
to
have
a
controversy
or
discussion.
justice
stewart
let's
consider
the
face
of
the
statute.
that's
what
ppg
said.
the
argument
was
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
make
the
drastic
change
that
it
did
make,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
would
have
talked
about
it.
and
we
said,
that's
nonsense.
you
can't
pursue
the
theory
of
the
dog
that
didn't
bark.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
mrs.
barry
says
that
this
argument,
the
logic
of
this
argument
would
mean
that
none
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
are
applicable
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
liquidated
damages
or
statute
of
limitations
or--
justice
potter
stewart
--right.
justice
potter
stewart
she
said
the
logic
of
your
argument
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
content,
and
you
say
that
the
logical
conclusion
of
your
argument
is
the
correct
conclusion.
