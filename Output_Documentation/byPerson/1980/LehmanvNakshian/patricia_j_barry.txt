ms.
patricia
j.
barry
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
parties
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
suits
against
the
federal
government
under
the
adea,
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act.
respondent
has
no
quarrel
with
petitioner
when
he
states
that
the
government
must
consent
in
order
to
be
sued.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
no,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
in
the
pernell
case
this
court
indicated
that
often
the
common
law
theory
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
as
it
existed
in
1789
or
in
1791
is
often
extended
if
it
can
be
analogized.
that
is,
if
the
remedy
that
you
have--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--no,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
a
landlord-tenant
case
coming
out
of
here
out
of
the
district
of
columbia.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
for
the
following
reasons.
i
believe
that
the
petitioner
confuses
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
with
an
unproved
and
an
unauthorized
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
from
jury
trials.
now,
if
the
petitioner
is
correct
that
in
order
for
a
jury
trial
to
be
obtained
when
the
government
is
sued
and
the
statute
is
silent,
then
the
instructional
guidance
set
out
by
this
court
in
pfitsch,
law,
wickwire,
and
the
accord
in
galloway
makes
no
sense,
because
in
all
of
those
instances
the
analysis
set
out
by
the
supreme
court
was
that
where
you
had
a
case
that
was
considered
an
action
at
law
and
there
was
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
at
least
with
respect
to
law
and
pfitsch,
the
conclusion
was
that
congress
intended
a
right
to
jury
trial.
now,
this
is
precisely
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
when
it
went
to
the
language
of
section
15.
as
petitioner
has
indicated
to
you,
there
was
heavy
reliance
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
fact
that
section
15(c)
talks
about
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
courts.
the
second
reliance
is
the
fact
that
section
15(c)
is
identical
in
its
language
to
section
7(c)
and
this
court
relied
upon
the
language,
legal
relief.
mr.
justice
marshall
writing
for
the
majority
in
lorillard
found
that
the
congress
is
imputed
with
having
knowledge
of
the
well
developed
common
law
meaning
of
the
term,
legal
relief.
and
therefore
concluded
that
congress
knows
what
it's
doing
when
it
uses
certain
terms
and
therefore
on
that
basis
as
well
as
other
bases
this
court
concluded
a
right
to
jury
trial
under
7(c).
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
!
i
think
that
dealt
with
compensation,
when
the
government
was
setting
up
requisitions
for...
i
think
it
occurred
during
world
war
i.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
and
i
don't
think
that
kind
of
writ
could
be
obtained
in
the
common
law
courts
of
the
king,
back
in
1789
and
1791.
now,
again
referring
to
the
language
of
section
15,
to
quote
this
court
in
pfitsch,
"all
difficulties
of
construction
vanish
if
we
are
willing
to
give
to
the
words
of
section
15,
"deliberately
adopted",
their
natural
meaning.
"
i
have
already
addressed
myself
to
the
language
of
the
fact
that
legal
relief
is
contained
in
section
15(c).
and
again
i
want
to
add
that
it
states
identically
the
same
statement
that
is
found
in
section
7(c),
that
is
a
person
aggrieved
by
age
discrimination
in
the
federal
sector
of
employment
is
entitled
to
bring
a
civil
action
in
a
federal
district
court
for
such
legal
and
equitable
relief
as
will
effectuate
the
purposes
of
this
chapter,
this
chapter
being
the
adea.
now,
petitioner
claims
that
section
15
is
really
different,
that
it
was
really
modeled
after
title
vii.
well,
as,
again
in
lorillard,
as
justice
marshall
noted,
section
4
of
the
adea
which
contains
the
prohibitions
against
age
discrimination
were
lifted,
or
derived,
in
haec
verba,
from
the
prohibitions
found
in
42
usc
2000(e)-2(a)(1).
but
this
court
said,
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
is
title
vii
overlay
and
that
there
is
language
found
from
tittle
vii,
you've
got
to
go
to
the
remedies
and
procedures.
and
in
here,
in
section
15,
as
well
as
section
15(c),
there
is
a
dramatic
departure
from
what
is
found
in
title
vii,
just
as
there
is
a
dramatic
departure
from
what
is
found
in
title
vii
in
the
section
7
or
the
other
portion
of
the
adea.
and
what
is
that?
there
is
an
opportunity
to
bypass
the
administrative
remedy
set
out
in
section
15(b)
for
the
federal
employee
and
there
is
significantly
the
right
to
seek
legal
relief.
that
term
vii.
the
only
mention
you
have
in
title
vii
of
any
description
of
relief
is
the
equitable
relief.
now,
the
petitioner
at
page
38
of
his
brief
says
that
we
should
not
ascribe
or
we
should
not
impute
to
congress
the
common
law
meaning
of
legal
relief
when
it
is
found
in
section
15(c)
because
congress
and
the
seventh
amendment
have
always
treated
the
issue
of
jury
trial
differently
in
the
context
of
actions
at
law
against
the
government.
well,
the
seventh
amendment
has
no
applicability
here
because
once
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
that
drops
out
of
the
picture,
and
then
the
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction
obtain.
and
you
go
to
the
statute--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--yes,
sir,
and
as
i
understand
that
this
court
has
held
in
pfitsch,
law,
wickwire,
and
galloway.
also,
in
the
3rd
circuit
the
collins
case,
which
i
found
to
be
a
rather
interesting
case.
the
3rd
circuit
found
that
the
impact
of
the
seventh
amendment
was
no
longer
present
once
the
government
of
the
virgin
islands
had
waived
immunity
and
allowed
itself
to
be
sued
in
a
tort
action.
then
it
said
it
was
free
of
the
impact
of
the
seventh
amendment.
then
the
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction
then
became
applicable.
and,
furthermore,
in
the
3rd
circuit,
in
that
collins
case,
that
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
were
two
critical
determinants
present,
which
were
the
two
same
determinants
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
here
in
miss
nakshian's
case,
concluding
that
there
was
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
with
respect
to
how
congress
has
treated
the
issue
of
jury
trials
differently,
i'm
uncertain
what
is
meant
by
that
language
except
that
there
have
been
instances,
as
the
petitioner
has
submitted
in
his
argument,
where
congress
has
expressly
denied
a
right
to
jury
trial.
one
of
them
is
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
another
is
actions,
all
actions
tried
under
the
tucker
act,
and
there
is
another
one
which
is
actions
to
quiet
title
found
at
28
usc
2409(a).
now,
on
the
other
hand,
congress
has
deemed
fit
to
expressly
grant
jury
trials.
those
are
found
in
the
tax
refund
suit
and
in
the
national
war
risk
insurance
act
and
world
war
veterans
act
cases,
and
national
life
insurance
act
cases.
but
in
those
instances
congress
was
already
responding
to
a
situation
in
which
the
case
law
had
already
established
a
right
to
jury
trial.
now,
with
respect
to
the
reliance
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
fact
that
there
was
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts,
again
pfitsch
states
that
the
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
of
importance
not
only
because
of
the
questions
directly
involved
but
because
the
answer
given
to
it
will
determine
incidentally
whether
plaintiffs
who
proceed
under
section
10
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
and
then
it
went
on
to
hold
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
establishes
as
an
incident
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
and
that
has
subsequently
been
followed
by
other
courts
of
appeals
including
the
collins
case,
whitney
v.
united
states,
hacker
v.
united
states.
now,
the
petitioner
for
the
first
time,
before
the
supreme
court
argued
that
the
language
found
in
section
15(f)
means
that
the
other
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
set
out
on
the
other
section
of
the
act
do
not
apply
to
actions
brought
by
persons
aggrieved
by
federal
age
discrimination.
your
honors,
if
we
follow
the
logic
of
what
the
petitioner
is
saying,
we
will
in
effect
have
a
situation
where
courts
will
be
completely
left
without
guidance
as
to
what
the
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
are
with
respect
to
federal
adea
cases.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
according
to
the
petitioner's
arguments
made
in
his
brief
as
well
as
in
his
reply
brief,
courts
would
not
be
allowed
to
turn
to
other
sections
of
the
adea
and
to
pertinent
portions
of
the
flsa
for
guidance.
for
example,
section
4
contains
prohibitions
against
age
discrimination.
however,
if
section
15(f)
is
interpreted
the
way
the
petitioner
would
have
you
interpret
it,
the
court
can't
go
over
this
to
find
out
what
would
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
age
discrimination.
furthermore,
we
can't
get...
according
to
the
petitioner's
argument...
we
cannot
get
liquidated
damages.
federal
employees
or
those
aggrieved
by
the
federal
sector
of
employment
could
not
get
attorneys'
fees
and
costs.
now,
petitioner
has
conceded
that
federal
employees
are
entitled
to
liquidated
damages
under
the
flsa,
as
reaffirmed
in
29
usc
404(f).
however,
they're
saying
by
the
logic
of
15(f),
you
don't
get
liquidated
damages
under
the
adea.
furthermore,
even
if
we
can
assume
that
section
15(f)
means
that
the
other
provisions
of
the
adea
do
not
apply
to
the
federal
sector,
you
still
have,
or
one
is
confronted
with,
the
situation
that
you
still
have
the
phrase,
legal
relief,
found
in
section
15(c).
you
still
have
section
15(c)
identical
to
the
language
of
7(c),
on
which
this
court
primarily
based
its
conclusion
that
public
employers
and
private
sector
employers
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
right.
now,
we
content
that
the
reason
that
congress
didn't
bother
to
amend
15(c)
in
1978...
well,
it
was
probably
an
oversight,
because
the
main
purpose
of
the
'78
amendments
was
not
being
focused
on
the
right
of
a
jury
trial.
that
was,
as
you
all
know,
was
incidentally
raised
october
19,
1977,
when
hr
5383
came
over
from
congress
over
to
the
senate
for
deliberation,
and
at
that
time
senator
kennedy
made
this
relatively
small
jury
trial
amendment
to
section
7.
it
is
codified
at
section
7(c)(2).
the
reason,
i
contend,
that
congress
did
not
bother
to
amend
section
15(c)
at
the
same
time
is
not
because
they
were
deliberately
going
to
deny
a
right
of
jury
trial
to
parties
bringing
actions
involving
the
federal
government,
simply
because
it
would
have
been
mere
surplusage.
congress
didn't
bother
defining
the
prohibitions
of
age
discrimination
in
section
15;
didn't
bother
defining
the
statute
of
limitations...
that's
found
in
29
usc
255;
didn't
bother
instructing
the
court
as
to
the
specificity
of
legal
and
equitable
relief
found
in
section
7(b);
didn't
bother
telling
the
government
you
have
to
post
notices--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--which
is
exactly
why
i
think
we're
before
this
court
today
is
that
the
problem,
i
believe,
that
came
up
in
october
of
'77
was,
first
of
all,
the
focus
of
the
'78
amendments
was
on
the
mandatory
retirement
age
and
then
eliminating
the
upper
age
ceiling
for
federal
employees.
they
wanted
to
expand
the
rights
of
federal
employees
and
in
fact
did
so
to
a
greater
degree
than
they
did
for
people
covered
under
the
other
sections
of
the
act.
for
example,
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
40
and
you're
protected
under
the
adea
if
you're
a
federal
employee
or
a
person
aggrieved
by
the
federal
sector
of
employment.
however,
you
do
have
restrictions,
qualifications
set
out
in
other
portions
of
the
adea
that
we
contend
section
15(f)
means
you
don't
apply
it
to
federal
employees.
for
example,
having
to
retire
at
70
or
if
you're
a
professor,
maybe
teaching
at
nih,
you're
not
going
to
have,
i
think
it's
section
12(c)
or
12(d)
applied
to
you.
i
think
that
was
the
focus.
furthermore,
the
only
cases
coming
up
at
that
time...
you
have
to
keep
in
mind,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
1967
the
age
act
had
been
around
for
a
number
of
years.
people
had
ripened,
the
courts
were
getting
a
handle
on
how
to
treat
the
private
sector
employment.
whereas,
the
public
employers,
we
attorneys
in
the
public,
you
know,
were
just
getting
into
it.
that
provision,
the
adea
was
not
amended
until
'74,
so
by
'77
federal
employees
weren't
even
thinking
of--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--your
honor,
i
think
i
can
distinguish
that
situation,
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act
at
1346(b)
is
simply
that
one
section
found
under
a
general
statute
that
did
not
allow
jury
trials
in
the
first
place.
i
think
it
can
be
distinguished
here
because
there
is
the
standard
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
says
acts
are
construed
in
pari
materia
whenever
that
can
be
done.
and
in
the
same
fashion,
i
think
that
congress
automatically
assumes
that
all
of
the
other
sections
of
the
act,
1
through
14,
16
and
17,
would
automatically
be
applied
to
section
15
unless
you
end
up
with
absurd
results--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
the
same
thing
as
what
the
petitioner
is
saying
that
there
is
a
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
against
jury
trials
unless
there
is
an
express
grant,
at
least,
as
i
understand
the
case
law
precedent
in
this
area
where
courts
have
been
called
upon
to
construe
the
mode
of
trial
procedure
where
the
statute
is
silent
and
the
government
is
being
sued,
and
the
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction
obtain.
i
want
to
add,
also,
your
honor,
that
while
we
have
approached
both
in
our
briefs
that,
and
certainly
because
the
court
of
appeals
relies
on
the
language
found
in
section
15,
i've
seen
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
express
grant
found
at
7(c)(2)
would
not
apply
to
section
15(f).
in
fact,
the
1974
amendments
stated
that
the
purpose
of
extending
the
rights
of...
or
rather,
extending
the
adea
protection
to
federal
employees
was
being
done
in
the
same
fashion
as
what
was
being
accomplished
for
the
private
sector
employees.
again,
in
1978,
the
jury
trial
amendment
was
an
incident
to
a
much
more
overpowering
interest
on
the
part
of
congress,
and
that
was
the
mandatory
retirement
age,
eliminating
the
upper
age
ceiling
for
federal
employees
and
also
trying
to
straighten
out
the
4(f)(2)
defense
set
up
by
employers
under
the...
you
know,
with
all
the
involuntary
retirements
that
were
occurring
under
the
pension
benefits
set
out
in
section
4(f)(2)
of
the
act.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
in
march
15,
1974,
hr
93-9113,
it
stated
that
the
committee
expects
that
expanded
coverage
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
law
will
remove
discriminatory
barriers
against
employment
of
older
workers
in
government
jobs
at
the
federal
and
local
government
levels,
as
it
has
and
continues
to
do
in
private
employment.
now,
this
is
important
because
in
'74
the
law
was
amended
to
include
all
public
employers.
however,
public
employers
were
included
by
simply
amending
the
definitions,
i
believe,
found
in
630.
section
15
came
in
to
give
jurisdiction
to
the
civil
service
commission,
not
because
there
was
an
absolute
analysis
of
section
15
to
section
717,
but
only
because
the
civil
service
commission
had
historically
had
jurisdiction
over
all
kinds
of
matters
regarding
federal
employees.
it
clearly
at
that
time
had
title
vii
jurisdiction
and
then,
simultaneously
in
1974,
was
given
jurisdiction
of
flsa
claims.
now,
the
reorganization
act,
i
contend,
to
a
certain
extent
has
mooted
that
distinction,
because
the
civil
service
commission
no
longer
has
jurisdiction
of
the
title
vii
complaints
nor
of
adea
complaints.
that,
along
with
the
relinquishment
of
the
dol
jurisdiction
over
adea
claims,
has
been
sent
over
to
the
eeoc.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
reorganization
plan
of
president
carter
was
that
he
was
very
concerned
with
the
fact
that
there
was
not
uniformity
of
result
being
obtained
because
of
the
different
agencies'
controlling
or
trying
to
administer
the
antidiscrimination
statutes
for
various
employers.
and
he
said,
the
reason
we
want
to
send
it
over
to
eeoc
is
because
eeoc
has
a
long
history
and
expertise
in
administering
and
resolving
complaints
of
discrimination.
if
we
use
the
reasoning
of
petitioner
section
15(f),
then
we
will
obtain
wholly
incongruous
results
in
that
that
desire
of
president
carter
will
not
be
met
by
the
reorganization
plan.
for
the
reasons
that
i've
just
stated,
we
will
not
be
able
to
get
liquidated
damages,
we
will
not
be
able
to
get
attorneys'
fees
and
costs,
we
will
not
be
able
to
do...
we
will
not
have
to
do
an
opt-in
class
action,
we
have
a
different
way
of
going
under,
we
will
go
under
rule

ms.
patricia
j.
barry
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honors,
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
asked
mr.
kneedler
whether
or
not
all
of
the
congresspeople
whose
names
appear
as
amici
on
the
brief
had
voted
on
the
'78
amendments.
it
was
brought
to
my
attention
that
except
for
mr.
lantos,
mr.
wyden,
and
mr.
frank,
and
possibly
mr.
jeffords,
aside
from
those
three
or
possibly
four,
all
of
the
members
who
appear
as
amici
on
the
brief--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--oh,
only
in
response
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
well,
your
honor,
i
thought
that
in
response
to
the
justice's
question
that
perhaps
the
intent,
those
who
wrote
up
the
'78
amendments,
who
were
close
to
the
law
and
writing
up
the
conference
reports
surrounding
hr--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--yes,
sir;
yes,
indeed,
the
best
kind
of
legislative
history
is
that
that
is
contemporaneous
with
the
law.
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
argument
presented
in
his
brief
regarding
"deep
pocket",
i
don't
believe
that
that
theory
is
applicable
to
to
the
instant
case
for
the
following
reasons.
in
fact,
an
age
case
is
the
kind
of
case
that
is
a
well
set
up
kind
of
case
for
juries
in
that
juries
are
limited
to
amounts
owing,
which
generally
take
the
form
of
back
pay,
and
liquidated
damages
becomes
the
measure
of
that
pecuniary
loss.
the
trend
of
the
case
law
at
this
time,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
3rd,
the
4th,
and
the
5th
circuits,
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
compensatory
or
punitive
damages.
and
in
fact,
at
page
14
of
the
conference
report,
it
states
that
the
adea
as
amended
by
this
act
does
not
provide
remedies
of
a
punitive
nature,
and
that
the
liquidated
damages
become
a
substitute
to
compensate
for
compensatory
damages
that
are
too
obscure
to
define
in
any
other
way.
i
might
add
that
this
court
unhesitatingly
applied
the
right
of
a
jury
trial
in
1978
to
state
employers,
or
to
other
public
employers,
unhesitatingly
where
the
theory
of
the
"deep
pocket"
would
have
as
much
applicability
as
it
would
in
the
instant
case.
now,
on
this--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--your
honor,
in
that
one--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--i
believe
it
was
imposed
upon
them
from
the
outside
in
1974
when
congress
amended
630
to
include
the
definition
of
state
employers
under
the
purview
of
the
act.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
rule
38(a)...
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
was
the
statutory
grant
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
i
believe
that
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing
is
that
in
order
for
38(a)
to
apply
in
the
instant
case
there
has
to
be
an
express
grant
of
jury
trial.
again,
i
believe
that
that
is
based,
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
brief,
on
a
presumption
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
that
again
is
confused
with
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize,
drops
out
of
the
picture
once
the
government
has
consented
to
be
sued.
and
then,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
as
the
3rd
circuit
held
in
the
collins
case,
as
it
was
held
in
the
monolith
case,
the
statutory
principles,
or
rather
the
principles
of
statutory
construction
become
applicable
and
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
is
no
longer
of
any
concern.
and
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
i
believe
that
that
was
the
instruction
set
out
by
this
court
in
law,
pfitsch,
wickwire,
and
galloway.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
state
that
based
upon
the
language
of
the
act,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
by
analyzing
section
15,
there
is
an
implied
right
of
jury
trial.
and
certainly,
as
has
been
indicated
in
prior
occasions
dealing
with
the
federal
torts
claims
act,
dealing
with
actions
to
quiet
title
to
real
estate
in
which
the
government
is
a
party,
congress
knows
how
to
deny
a
jury
trial,
and
expressly
chose
not
to
take
such
a
deliberate
act
in
the
case
of
the
adea.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
in
making
an
express
grant
of
jury
trial?
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
yes,
sir,
which
they
did
in
section
7(c)(2),
probably
operating
under
the--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
have
allowed
an
express
grant
of
jury
trial
as
the
petitioner
conceded
for
tax
refund
suits.
but
again,
your
honor,
as
i
recall
the
history
of
that
particular
statute,
it
was
already
a
matter
of
case
law
under,
revised
statutory--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--i
note
the
petitioner
raised
that
but
i
think
it's
a
very
artificial
one.
for
example,
in
the
legislative
history
surrounding,
there
was
a
senate
report
that
came
out
and
the
senators
who
signed
off
said
that
it
was
an
artificial,
fictional
kind
of
thing
that
really
no
longer
had
an
applicability
because
the
commissioner
never
paid
the
bill.
everybody
knew
that
the
federal
government
really
paid
it
and
the
u.s.
attorney
defended
it--
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
with...
in
passing
in
dicta,
that
i
believe
that
this
court
found
in
wickwire
that
it
really
came
from
a
fair
implication
from
the
statutory
language,
that
is,
it
was
an
action
at
law.
and
in
fact
it
was
noted
that
the
petitioner
in
that
case...
oh,
i'm
sorry,
the
respondent,
which
was
the
government,
indicated
that,
you
know,
the
seventh
amendment
applied,
and
this
court
chastised
the
government
for
making
such
an
argument
and,
said,
no
it
came
from
the
implication
of
the
statutory
language
and
that
it
was
an
action
at
law.
thus,
i
would
say,
your
honors,
that
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
is
well
grounded
in
precedent,
when
it
held
that
there
is
an
implied
right
to
a
jury
trial
by
the
fact
that
congress
vested
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts
and
by
the
fact
that
it
used
the
identical
language
found
in
section
7(c)
when
it
developed
section
15(c)
and
used
the
term
"legal
relief".
now,
as
theodore
roosevelt
said,
he
asked
the
question,
who
is
the
government?
the
government
is
all
of
us
in
this
room.
it
is
you
and
it
is
i,
and
to
paraphrase
the
words
of
justice
sneed
concurring
in
franquez
v.
united
states,
he
states,
"i
am
unwilling
to
assume
that
jury
trials
will
not
adequately
protect
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
for
it
is
after
all
only
placing
the
interest
of
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
ourselves.
"
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
being
the
sun
king,
i'm
sure
he
identified
the
state
with
himself.
ms.
patricia
j.
barry
i
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention,
your
honors.
