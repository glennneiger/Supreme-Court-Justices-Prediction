justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that's
brought
to
mind
that,
what
would
you
say
about
a
suit
against
an
officer
of
the
united
states,
the
attorney
general
or
someone,
in
his
official
capacity,
seeking
damages
of
a
bivens
character,
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there...
maybe
i'm
just
totally
off
base.
is
there
a
possibility
of
an
action
against
someone
in
his
official
capacity...
then
it
would
be
like
a
suit
against
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
your
reading
of
rule
38
just
a
way
of
saying,
the
question
is
whether
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
or
is
not
given
by
a
statute?
that's
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
rule
38
doesn't
add
or
subtract
from
anything
as
i
see
it.
