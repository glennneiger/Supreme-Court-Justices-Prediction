mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
brings
an
ex
post
facto
question
before
the
court,
challenging
the
application
to
this
petitioner
of
a
florida
statute
reducing
the
statutory
gain
time
formula
available
to
those
incarcerated
in
florida.
although
not
a
class
action
it
has
potential
consequences
to
as
many
as
16,000
persons
sentenced
in
florida
prior
to
january
1,
1979.
a
statement
of
the
rather
brief
facts
delineates
the
issue
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
in
1976
weaver,
following
a
negotiated
plea
bargain,
was
sentenced
to
15
years
in
the
penitentiary.
florida
law
at
that
time
prescribed
a
gain
time
formula
which
was
mandated
upon
good
conduct.
we
use
"gain
time"
as
an
expression
in
florida.
some
states:
"good
time".
in
common
vernacular,
time
off
for
good
behavior.
the
state
concedes
with
great
candor
that
all
one
needed
to
do
under
the
florida
statute,
and
i
quote,
was
"stay
out
of
trouble".
the
time
was
earned
each
month.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
so
called
new
law,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
added
the
phrase,
"at
beginning
of
each
month".
but
if
you
read
both
statutes,
you
will
see
in
subsection
1(c)
of
the
so
called
old
law,
or
first
statute,
that
it
is
added
each
month.
as
a
matter
of
administrative
convenience
alone,
when
the
prisoner
is
introduced
to
the
system,
a
so
called
tentative
expiration
date
is
calculated
on
the
assumption
that
he
would
earn
all
of
the
time.
this
is
done
under
both
statutes.
in
1978
florida
reduced
the
formula,
the
former
formula
which
was
set
out
in
brief
as
the
so
called
5-10-15,
reduced
to
3-6-9,
a
40
percent
reduction
applied
from
january
1,
1979,
forward.
the
effect
of
this
upon
my
client
is
that
if
he
had
earned
all
of
the
time
under
the
old
statute
he
would
have
been
required
to
serve
only
8-1/2
years.
under
the
new
statute,
11
years.
thus
the
burden
of
the
two
years.
upon
petition
by
several
pro
se
petitioners
acting
separately
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
ruling
was
had
which
is
now
the
subject
of
the
petition
before
this
court.
acting
pro
se,
without
oral
argument,
and
i
must
say,
in
candor,
without
discussion
of
the
controlling
authorities
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
past,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
in
effect
that
this
act
of
the
florida
legislature
was
an
act
of
legislative
grace
which
of
course
is
a
monumental
begging
of
the
question.
the
establishment
of
the
system
in
the
first
instance
is
the
act
of
grace.
but
the
amendment,
alteration,
and
change
is
not
an
act
of
grace,
and
that
was
the
issue
not
discussed.
that
doctrine,
of
course,
has
been
discredited
in
virtually
every
state
in
which
this
issue
has
arisen,
and
in
comparable
situations
it
has
been
discredited,
we
feel,
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
once
the
state
adopts
an
early
release
procedure,
be
it
parole
or
otherwise,
it
may
not
change
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
not
for
those
who
are
already
in
the
system,
your
honor,
because
that
brings
me
immediately,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
classic
definitions
which
the
court
has
given
to
an
ex
post
facto
loss,
it's
the
calder
case
in
1798,
in
which
we
speak
of
the
critical
time
is
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
calder
limits
it
to
criminal
cases
and
a
perhaps
small
area
of
penalties
or
forfeitures.
beyond
that
the
effective
time
is
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
thereafter,
under
calder,
adoption
of
a
legislative
act
which
would
allow
a
greater
penalty
is
an
ex
post
facto
law.
in
1883,
for
example,
in
kring,
the
court
expressed
it
slightly
differently,
stating
that
with
relation
to
the
consequences
of
the
offense,
that
which
alters
the
situation
of
the
defendant
or
prisoner
to
his
disadvantage,
is
a
forbidden
ex
post
facto
law.
we
do
not
need
to
go
to
parole,
pardon,
things
of
that
type,
because
we
are
confronted
here
with
gain
time,
which
the
state
again
concedes,
pages
5
and
6
of
its
brief,
gain
time
has
the
effect
of
determining
the
time
of
confinement.
and
of
course,
confinement
being
the
antithesis
of
liberty,
and
the
extension
of
it,
or
the
diminution
of
it
obviously
affects
the
penalty.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
that
was
our
opinion,
although
of
course
you
would
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
you're
only
dealing
with
the
gain
time,
but
i
would
feel
that
that
would
follow.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
there
are
some
differences
between
parole,
obviously
it
being
a
much
more
subjective
matter.
we
have,
for
example,
outlined
in
our
brief
the
various
types
of
early
release
provisions
which
florida
does
have
and
then
contrast
it
with
the
so
called
statutory
gain
time,
the
time
off
for
good
behavior
with
which
we
are
concerned
here,
and
so
called--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--there
are
cases
on
that,
your
honor.
the
question
would
be
whether
that
ultimately
amounted
to
a
procedural
change
or
it
would
bring
us
to
the
fourth
classification
which
is
set
out
in
calder,
that
which
changes
the
testimony,
or
the
nature
of
the
testimony,
to
the
point
where
it
would
on
the
one
hand
insure
a
conviction
and
without
it,
on
the
other
hand,
there
would
be
no
conviction.
then
one
would
have
the
fourth
category
in
calder.
so
i
would
think
the
conflicting
arguments
to
be
advanced
on
the
one
hand
from
your
procedural
change,
which
is
not
ex
post
facto;
on
the
other
hand,
a
change
of
such
significance
that
it
falls
within
the
fourth
category
of
calder.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
it
might
very
well
be
xx
the
fourth
definition
of
calder,
although
there
are
some
interesting
cases
which
we
did
not
brief
because
i
sought
only
to
brief
those
decisions
of
the
court
which
related
to
punishment.
this
is
the
third
category
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
chase.
there
are,
i
would
suggest
to
you,
if
it
was
clear
that
the
admission
of
this
evidence...
for
example,
the
changing
of
the
nature
of
the
testimony,
which
i
believe
is
the
phrase
in
calder...
for
example,
you'll
find
that
quoted,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
page
20
of
our
brief:
"every
law
that
alters
the
legal
rules
of
evidence
and
receives
less
or
different
testimony
than
the
law
required
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
"
we
need
not
go
that
far
in
this
case.
we
contend
the
case
is
almost
squarely
within
lindsey
v.
washington,
a
1937
case,
in
which
the
court
held
that
that
which
had
been
formerly
a
permissive
sentence
now
made
mandatory
subsequent
to
the
commission
of
the
crime
was
a
forbidden
ex
post
facto
law;
followed
by
the
per
curiam
affirmance
of
the
three
judge
district
court
in
massachusetts
in
1968
in
greenfield,
which
held
that
there,
subsequent
to
the
crime,
massachusetts
adopted
a
statute
which
precluded
parole
violators
from
earning
gain
time
for
the
first
six
months
after
reincarceration,
that
also
being
held
a
prohibited
ex
post
facto
law.
it's
interesting
to
compare
the
result
in
that
case
with
this
case.
in
massachusetts
the
petitioner,
greenfield,
lost
100
percent
of
the
opportunity
to
achieve
gain
time
for
six
months.
in
this
case
my
client
loses
40
percent
for
12
years.
and
i've
measured
that
in
the
brief,
and
i
think
you
can
see
the
distinction
in
the
materiality
and
the
substantiality
of
the
burden
imposed
upon
him.
as
i
say--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
indeed
it
would.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
could
not
agree
with
you
more.
the
distinction
need
not
be
made
in
this
case
because
the
extending
amendment
comes
not
merely
after
sentencing,
but
after
approximately
2-1/2
years
of
acquisition
of
time
under
the
old
formula.
i
may
say,
it's
particularly
significant
and
i
agree
with
you
completely,
because
this
comes
as
a
result
of
a
plea
bargain.
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
number
of
remonstrances
to
trial
judges
in
their
seminars;
keep
in
mind
what
the
man
will
really
serve.
we
all
know
that
in
the
combative
atmosphere
of
the
criminal
justice
system
the
ultimate...
to
use
perhaps
an
analogy
familiar
in
another
situation,
the
bottom
line
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is,
how
much
time
must
i
actually
serve?
not
what
is
written
on
the
paper,
but
how
long
will
i
be
there
and
how
long
will
i
lose
my
liberty?
i
think
that
that
point
could
very
well
be
made.
the
problem,
however,
is
that
from
the
time
of
calder,
the
date
of
the
crime--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
a
plea
bargaining
situation,
one
surrenders
certain
rights.
this
man
pled
guilty.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
i
think
not
for
this
purpose.
i
simply
point
out
that
if
one
goes
to
reliance,
if
one
deals
with
the
test
enunciated
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that
is,
no
vesting,
no
right
of
reliance,
then
one
can
make
an
argument.
here
there
is,
in
this
case,
indeed
reliance.
of
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--beyond
that,
i
think...
if
i
might
pursue
that
just
for
a
moment,
the
trial
judge
himself
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
it.
let
us
suggest
that
florida
abolishes
gain
time
january
1,
1979.
the
trial
judge
did
not
intend
for
the
man
actually
to
spend
15
years,
he
measured
it
by
the
law
in
effect
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
is
entitled,
if
the
court
please,
when
he
enters
into
the
judicial
system,
to
believe
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
means
what
it
says
and
that
the
law
and
rules
cannot
be
changed.
and
i
think
to
that
extent
society
should
be
concerned
about
what
he
relied
upon;
yes,
indeed.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
all
right.
that...
that...
yes,
sir.
and
that
brings--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--that's
correct.
it
was
not
taken
away
from
him
in
the
sense
of
recalculation
under
the
new
formula.
and
that
brings
me
directly
to
one
of
the
answers
which
the
state
gives.
this
is
not
retroactive
because
we
only
take
it
from
this
day
forward,
we
don't
take
that
which
was
already
earned.
that
is
not
even
a
good
argument
under
florida
law,
and
it's
one
reason
that
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
even
deal
with
it.
florida,
for
example,
defines
a
retrospective
or
retroactive
statute
as
one
which
attaches
a
disability
to
a
prior
act.
and
of
course,
obviously
this
does.
this
court
in
kring,
which
i
mentioned
earlier,
spoke
of
attaching
consequences
to
prior
acts.
this
clearly
is
aimed
at
the
measure
of
punishment,
and
therefore
is
retroactive.
one
is
not
in
prison
merely
to
acquire
or
to
lose
gain
time.
one
is
there
serving
a
sentence
as
a
result
of
criminal
misconduct.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
well,
in
dobbert
the
court
did
not
answer
the
question
because
the
man
was
sentenced
to
death
and
did
not
get
the
life
sentence,
but
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--we
know
that
he
is
losing
this
time
each
month,
your
honor,
from
january
1,
1979.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
the
state
says,
the
words
under
the
old
statute
were,
"faithful,
diligent,
industrious,
orderly,
and
peaceful;
good
conduct.
"
under
the
new
statute,
"satisfactory"
and
"acceptable".
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
no,
indeed,
your
honor.
that
comes
from
the
denial
of
the
gain
time
for
the
lack
of
good
conduct,
which
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
he
also
may
forfeit
prior
earned
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
as
a
matter
of
mathematics,
he
was
in
the
ten
day
a
month
category
at
the
time
the
statute
went
into
effect.
he
is
now
in
the
six
days--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes.
that's
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
but
the
court
said,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
if
in
fact
petitioner
dobbert
had
not
been
condemned
to
death
but
had
been
sentenced
to
the
life
imprisonment
and
had
to
serve
the
25
years,
my
recollection
is
the
court
said,
there
would
be
a
very
serious
ex
post
facto
question.
and
i
believe
under
the
decided
precedents...
in
fact,
i
would
say
that
would
be
governed
almost
completely
by
lindsey
v.
washington,
which
you
distinguished
in
your
opinion.
remembering
also
that
in
that
case
dobbert
made
what
i
would
regard
as
virtually
a
sophistry
that
he
wasn't
governed
by
either
statute
because
there
wasn't
a
valid
capital
offense
statute
in
effect
in
florida
at
that
time.
it
is
argued
by
the
state
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
in
unearned
gain
time,
and
therefore
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
not
applicable.
in
other
words,
if
we
do
not
reach
procedural
due
process
in
the
cause,
then
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
i
submit
that
those
are
both
mutually
independent.
we
mention
such
cases
as
greenfield
and
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
in
our
brief
to
point
out
that
the
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
gain
time
once
acquired
is
a
liberty
interest,
and
once
you
lose
earned
gain
time
for
disciplinary
reasons,
it
must
be
done
with
certain
minimal
procedural
due
process.
my
point
in
citing
those
cases
is
not
to
suggest
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
at
all,
but
merely
to
point
out
that
by
definition
the
right
to
acquire
a
liberty
interest
necessarily
affects
liberty
in
the
first
instance,
thus
affects
punishment,
and
thus
is
within
those
cases
which
we
cite
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
lindsey?
i
think
lindsey
is
clearly
in
point
in
our
situation,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
all
right.
it
was
a
washington
statute
which
provided,
as
i
recall,
the
period
was
15
years,
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
that
was
permissive.
it
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
i
recall
it
was
15
years.
it
was
within
the
sentencing
range
of
the
judge;
subsequent
to
the
commission
of
the
offense
it
was
made
mandatory.
forgive
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
the
number
but
the
point
is
that
what
was
formerly
the
outer
limit
of
his
discretion
became
a
minimum.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
my
recollection...
i
do
not
recall--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--yes,
he
was.
and
the
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
but
the
court
said
that
it
need
not
inquire
whether
technically
that
was
an
increase
in
punishment
because
it
violated
the
statute;
that
he
had
the
right
to
go
before
the
judge
and
receive
consideration
by
a
trial
judge
who
was
not
obliged
to
sentence
him
ten
to
15
years,
but
he
might
very
well,
under
the
former
statute.
and
i
think
obviously
that's
a
much
more
ethereal
concept
than
the
one
my
client--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--well,
that's
what
this
court
held;
yes,
indeed.
because
he
was
sentenced
to
death,
and
so
it
made
no
difference.
it
was
purely
theoretical.
i
think
i
have
a
stronger
case
than
lindsey,
and
of
course
dobbert
had
no
case.
i
would
say
quite
briefly
in
closing--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
i
had
just
passed
that
over
because
i
saw
my
time
was
running
out.
i
say,
we
have
printed
in
the
reply,
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
a
comparison
of
the
former
statutory
gain
time,
the
permissive
statutes
which
are
not
mentioned
by
the
state,
the
administrative
rules
which
were
adopted
by
the
division
of
corrections
pursuant
to
those
permissive
statutes,
which
altogether
permitted
my
client
both
to
have
the
benefit
of
the
5-10-15
formula.
that's
substantially
all.
i
don't
believe
that
i
quite
explained
away
the
going
to
college
or
the
disability,
but
there's
nothing
on
this
record
that
shows
that
my
client
is
even
qualified
to
do
that,
so
i
think
that
on
the
whole
i
have
made
a
case
in
our
reply
brief
that
what
the
state
says
is
simply
not
the
case,
and
that
the
only
change
in
the
law
is
the
one
which
the
supreme
court
of
florida
says
at
the
outset
of
its
brief
opinion.
the
difference
in
this
statute
is
we
formerly
had
a
5-10-15
formula;
we
now
have
a
3-6-9.
that's
the
question
only.
i
think
florida
should
have
kept
its
word
and
that
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
have
his
gain
time
calculated
from
that
day
forward
under
the
old
formula.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
only
have
a
few
brief
points.
not
only
did
the
supreme
court
of
florida
not
consider
the
so
called
ameliorative
effects
of
this
statute,
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
appendix.
you
will
find
the
response
of
the
attorney
general
to
the
pro
se
petition.
you'll
find
the
argument
wasn't
even
made.
and
the
obvious
reason
it
wasn't
made,
is
if
you
lay
them
down
time
doesn't
permit.
mr.
justice
marshall
correctly
points
out,
the
regulations,
the
permissive,
general
statutes,
which
were
merely
incorporated
together
in
a
codification
of
the
new
law,
show
that
the
difference
is
just
what
the
court
said,
they
changed
the
schedule.
mr.
allbritton
says
my
client
has
been
deprived
of
nothing.
he
has
been
deprived
of
the
statutorily
guaranteed
right
to
acquire
gain
time
which
the
state
says
he
could
do,
"merely
by
staying
out
of
trouble.
"
now,
let
me
go
quite
quickly
to
one
of
the
points
raised
by
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
your
honor,
here's
the
situation
on
that.
actually,
there's
still
a
third
statute,
and
i
don't
want
to
confuse
things,
but
the
ultimate
effect
of
it
was
that
under
the
new
law
they
add
the
word
monthly
in
the
early
portion
of
the
statute.
but
if
you
will
read
subsection
1(c)
at
the
end
of
the
15-day
provision
into
the
9-day
provision,
you
will
see
that
the
gain
time
is
credited
each
month.
under
both
statutes
the
state
still
calculates
the
tentative
date
because
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
under
the
new
law--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
they
gave--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--no
sir--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--because
there's
no
change.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
no,
sir.
let
me
go
very
quickly.
need
it
be
a
part
of
the
sentence?
i
suppose
that
is
tied
to
the
word
"annexed"
in
the
third
category
in
calder.
first,
let
me
say,
mr.
justice
chase
adds
at
the
end,
"or
similar
laws".
i
know
of
no
case
that
says
they
must
be
physically
tied
the
one
to
the
other,
that
the
judge
must
breathe
the
words,
you're
sentenced
to
so
many
years
subject
to
all
of
the
laws
of
florida.
if
one
so
desires,
i
have
cited
in
my
reply
brief,
the
fact
that
indeed
florida
biennially
and
before
this
time,
reenacts
in
its
entirety
all
of
its
criminal
statutes...
all
of
its
statutes,
indeed.
so
they
are
enacted
at
the
same
time.
finally,
i
think
the
court
disposed
of
that
point
in
the
lindsey
case
which
we
discussed
earlier,
because
it
said
we
need
not
go
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
technically
a
change
in
the
punishment
annexed.
and
let
me
finally
say
that
if
that
is
the
law
of
florida,
then
florida
can
change
all
of
its
sentences,
because
your
honors
can
look
at
the
florida
statutes
and
see
that
it
merely
provides
that
murder
is
a
certain
type
of
felony,
burglary
is
a
certain
type
of
felony,
and
all
of
the
punishments
are
somewhere
else.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
corporate
and
antitrust
litigation.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
the
scafati
case?
i
found
it
by
first
finding
it
in
the
district
court
opinions
and
then
finding
the
per
curiam
affirmance.
i
believe
your
honor
noted
in
that
case
that
you
would
have
granted
oral
argument
as
opposed
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--we
had
westlaw,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
i
found
that
in
that
manner.
i
might
say,
finally,
and
quite
briefly
in
closing,
if
you
read
the
district
court
opinion
by
circuit
judge
aldrich
you
will
find
that
the
provisions
in
massachusetts
are
almost
identical
to
florida,
even
down
to
the
calculating
of
the
up
front
time.
absolutely
no
difference,
except
greenfield
came
out
immeasurably
better
that
weaver
would
under
what
florida
tries
to
do
to
him
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
the
district
court,
indeed
it
did.
massachusetts
had
a
better
argument.
if
i
could
pursue
that
a
moment--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--no,
sir,
it
came
from
a
three
judge
district
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--enjoining
the
enforcement
of
the
massachusetts
statute,
the
opinion
written
by
circuit
judge
bailey
aldrich.
i
might
give
you,
if
i
could--
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
--the
chronology
was,
commission
of
the
offense,
sentencing.
and
at
that
point
massachusetts
changed
the
law
which
provided
that
henceforth
parole
violators
who
are
reincarcerated
would
lose
the
right
to
acquire
gain
time
for
the
first
six
months
of
the
reincarceration.
the
statute
had
a
savings
clause.
it
saved
its
effect
for
all
those
out
on
parole.
it
did
not
save
it
for
those
in
prison
but
not
yet
on
parole.
the
commonwealth
made
what
i
thought
was
a
rather
good
argument
that
by
thereafter
accepting
parole
scafati
in
effect
was
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
time
of
the
parole.
the
three
judge
district
court
rejected
that
argument
and
cited
many
of
the
cases
which
we
cite
and
so
held
in
that
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
macdonald,
jr.
i
think
lindsey
does,
and
i
think
then
one
must
go
back
to
the
more
generalized
pronouncements
which
take
us
back
to
kring,
cummings,
and
all
the
way
back
to
calder,
as
to
the
nature
of
punishment.
but
i
think
lindsey
and
scafati
are
the
closest
and
finally,
as
i
say,
virtually
every
state
court
which
has
passed
upon
this
has
held
in
our
direction.
thank
you
very
much.
