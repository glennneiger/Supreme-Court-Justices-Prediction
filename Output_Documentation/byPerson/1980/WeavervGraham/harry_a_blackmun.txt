justice
blackmun
mr.
macdonald,
straighten
me
out
on
one
detail.
he
was
sentenced
in
'76
originally?
justice
blackmun
the
statute
was
changed
in
'78?
justice
blackmun
and
what
about
the
gain
time
that
he
"earned"
up
to
that
time?
was
that
under
the
old
system?
justice
blackmun
that
was
never
taken
away
from
him?
justice
blackmun
but
counsel,
i
come
back
again.
then
you
are
relying
on
these
additional
provisions?
justice
blackmun
in
other
words
you
would
not
be
here
if
they
were
not
present
in
your
statute?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
wonder
why
you
make
this
concession?
justice
blackmun
i
wonder
why
you
make
this
concession.
isn't
your
case
just
as
strong
in
theory
at
least,
without
these
additional
provisions?
justice
blackmun
well,
in
essence,
isn't
your
argument
that
all
that
lies
ahead
after
the
change
in
the
statute
was
an
expectation
on
which
he
may
not
rely?
