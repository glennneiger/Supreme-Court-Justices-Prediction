before
you
do,
mr.
macdonald,
apparently
there
was
another
change,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
between
the
two
laws.
one
is
that
at
least
administratively
the
credit
was
given
right
at
the
beginning
and
the
provisional
time
of
release
was
set
right
at
the
beginning.
and
then,
under
the
contemporary
law,
the
credit
is
given
only
when
it
accrues,
is
that
right?
justice
stewart
that's
fine...
up
front
in
quotations,
is
it?
justice
stewart
so
in
other
words
you
make
no
point
of
that?
justice
stewart
all
right.
justice
stewart
that
was
my
only
question.
