justice
rehnquist
and
that
was
by
statute?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
florida
after
the
commission
of
the
offense
but
previous
to
the
trial
expanded
the
type
of
information
that
could
be
used
by
the
trial
judge
in
sentencing
the
defendant,
if
he
were
convicted.
this
new
information
would
be
admissible
under
the
new
system
but
not
under
the
old
system.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
ex
post
facto?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
dobbert,
then,
because
there
in
the
new
statute
it
was
provided
for
a
minimum
of
25
years,
which
the
old
statute
had
not
provided?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
we
still
don't
know
how
much
time
your
man
has
got,
sir?
justice
rehnquist
wasn't
there
some
discretion?
justice
rehnquist
what
about
if
you
take
it
from
the
time
of
the
offense,
the
promise,
as
we're
calling
legislative
enactments
here,
in
dobbert
was
that
you
were
going
to
serve
a
minimum
of
25
years
regardless
under
the
new
statute?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
a
pretty
theoretical
distinction?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
that
a
pretty
theoretical
distinction?
i
mean,
if
somewhere
on
the
statute
books
is
contained
a
method
for
calculating
gain
time
and
it's
changed
during
the
course
of
a
prisoner's
imprisonment,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
in
the
sentencing
section
of
the
code
or
in
some
other,
or
in
the
penal
institution
section
of
the
code?
justice
rehnquist
--but
when
this
law
went
into
effect,
the
minimum
that
this
defendant
could
have
received
went
up,
didn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
there's
more
discretion?
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
discretion
that
can
be
used
against
him
as
well
as
for
him?
justice
rehnquist
can
i
just
ask
you
one
of
the...
an
admittedly
extreme
example
so
that
i
at
least
understand
what
your
argument
or
charge
is.
supposing
he
is
sentenced
to
15
years
and
the
legislature
has
not
provided
any
gain
time
at
all,
and
he
is
on
the
last
day
of
his
15th
year
and
the
legislature
changes
the
sentence
of
his
crime
to
20
years.
and
he
goes
to
pick
up
his
stuff
at
the
warden's
office
and
the
warden
says,
sorry,
you're
going
to
have
to
serve
an
extra
five
years
because
the
legislature
just
changed
the
statute.
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
