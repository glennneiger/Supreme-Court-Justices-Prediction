justice
white
but
you're
saying
that
he
can
behave
all
he
wants
to,
but
he
will
earn
less
good
time
every
day
than
he
did
before?
justice
white
and
hence
he's
been
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
earn
2x
good
time
instead
of
x?
justice
white
at
the
time
he
went
into
prison
the
promise
was,
every
day
you're
good
you
earn
ten
days?
justice
white
and
that
promise
was
changed
to
every
day
you're
good
you
get
five,
or
whatever
the
figure
is?
justice
white
that's
one
ground
for
your
case?
justice
white
and
tell
me
why.
justice
white
it
required
a
penalty
of
15
years?
justice
white
well,
what
was
the
authorized
penalty
at
the
time
of
the
crime
in
lindsey?
justice
white
so
what
was
he
sentenced
to,
though?
justice
white
wasn't
he
sentenced
to
15
years?
justice
white
now,
here's
a
law
that
says,
at
the
time
of
the
crime
you
can
be
punished
up
to
15
years.
he
is
sentenced
to
15
years?
justice
white
then,
the
law
is
changed
to
15
years?
said
15
years
mandatory?
justice
white
you
think
that's
different
from
dobbert,
you
say?
justice
white
mr.
attorney
general,
suppose
the
criminal
statute
providing
for
the
penalty
said,
the
penalty
for
this
crime
shall
be
15
years,
less
any
good
time
earned
at
the
rate
of
five
days
for
every
day
of
good
behavior.
i
suppose
you
would
be
here
arguing
the
same
thing,
that
the
legislature
after
a
fellow
is
sentenced
under
that
provision,
that
the
legislature
could
amend
that
penalty
provision
by
saying,
less
two
days
for
every
day
of
good
behavior?
justice
white
wouldn't
your
argument
follow?
justice
white
i
understand
that.
justice
white
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless,
if
prior
to
amendment
the
warden
refused
to
give
him
good
time
for
days
that
he
behaved,
i
suppose
the
warden
would
be
in
trouble,
wouldn't
he?
justice
white
well,
the
warden
couldn't...
the
warden
couldn't
tell
him
in
advance
either
that,
well,
you
may
have
earned
a
lot
of
good
time
up
to
date,
but
from
here
on
you
don't
earn
any
good
time.
justice
white
no,
i'm
sure
he
wouldn't.
he'd
know
better.
justice
white
what
do
you
do
with...
what
was
the
name
of
that
case,
that
your
colleagues
rely
on
here?
scafati?
what
do
you
do
about
that
case?
justice
white
so
you're
deprived
of
the
right
to
earn
good
time
credits
for
six
months?
justice
white
so
you
distinguish
your
case
from
scafati
in
saying
that
the
good
time
statute
was
separate
from
the
sentencing
statute?
justice
white
it
has
to
for
you
to
win,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
i'm
just
curious,
do
you
practice
criminal
law?
justice
white
i'm
just
curious.
how
did
you
come
across
the
scafati
case?
justice
white
and
you
found
that...
you
were
looking
through.
did
you
look...
were
you
looking
in
lexis
for
the
district
court
cases--
justice
white
--the
westlaw,
and
you
found
the
district
court
cases
included
in
scafati--
justice
white
--and
then
went
to
westlaw,
and
it
said
there,
affirmed?
justice
white
of
course,
scafati
didn't...
the
per
curiam
affirmance
didn't
cite
any
authority,
did
it?
justice
white
did
the
district
court?
justice
white
what
did
the...
was
scafati,
didn't
that
come
from
a
state
court?
justice
white
three-judge
district
court.
justice
white
and
what
did
they
rely
on?
justice
white
like
what?
do
you
think
there
are
cases
other
than
scafati
in
this
court--
justice
white
--that
hold
squarely
on
this
one?
