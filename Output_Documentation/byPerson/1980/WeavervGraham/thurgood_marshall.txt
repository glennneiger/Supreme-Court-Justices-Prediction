justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
you
do
recognize
that
this
man
loses
four
days
a
month?
justice
marshall
but
he
still
loses
the
four
days?
justice
marshall
he
still
loses
four
days?
justice
marshall
what
you're
saying
is,
although
he
loses
four
days,
he
can
get
some
more
days
out
of
something
else?
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
marshall
but
you
still
admit
he
loses
more
than
four
days?
justice
marshall
no,
doesn't
he
lose
four
days?
justice
marshall
can
he
get
ten
days
like
he
did
before?
justice
marshall
can
he
get
ten--
justice
marshall
--so
he
loses
four?
justice
marshall
sure.
he
can
get
it
in
a
lot
of
ways.
he
can--
--counsel,
without
these
additional
provisions
you'd
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
marshall
after
it's
given?
justice
marshall
it
can
be
withdrawn
after
it's
given?
justice
marshall
what
about
all
this
grace?
justice
marshall
well,
why
would
he
have
any
rights
under
this
last
question
you
answered?
why
would
he
have
any
rights
at
all
if
it
was
grace?
justice
marshall
and
the
state
can
take
it
away?
justice
marshall
such
as
due
process?
justice
marshall
oh,
ex
post
facto.
justice
marshall
no,
mr.
attorney
general,
i
just
want
to
know
what
articles
of
the
constitution
do
not
apply
to
"grace"
matters?
justice
marshall
i'm
not
worried
about
what
i
know.
i'm
asking
you
the
question.
justice
marshall
well,
was
this
man
with
four
days
a
month
withdrawn?
justice
marshall
well,
suppose
i
look
at
that
plus
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner?
justice
marshall
i
said,
all
of
what
you
said,
plus
that.
justice
marshall
is
this
man
old
or
ill?
justice
marshall
well,
how
can
you
claim
that
it'll
help
him?
justice
marshall
if
he
gets
ill
or
old--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
that
court
rejected
petitioner's
effort
to
obtain
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
which
the
petitioner
challenged
the
application
of
a
florida
statute
enacted
after
the
day
of
his
defense.
that
statute
reduced
the
availability
of
what's
called
gain-time
for
good
conduct.
to
this
gain-time
provision,
the
state
rewards
each
prisoner
for
good
conduct
and
obedience
to
prison
rules
by
shortening
the
portion
of
his
sentence
he
must
serve.
the
new
florida
statute
reduced
the
amount
of
his
gain-time
for
good
conduct.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
petitioner's
claim
that
this
reduction
violated
the
constitution
ban
against
ex
post
facto
laws
and
we
hold
that
the
application
of
florida's
new
gain-time
statute
to
petitioner,
it
does
in
fact
constitute
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
ban
as
applied
to
petitioner.
the
statute
alters
the
consequences
of
a
crime
already
completed.
for
the
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
florida's
new
gain-time
provision
constricts
petitioner's
opportunity
to
earn
early
release
and
thus
makes
the
consequence
of
his
crime
worse
than
when
the
crime
occurred.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
therefore
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
the
chief
justice
had
joined.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
