mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
i
understand
the
issue
urged
upon
this
court,
it
is
that
the
application
of
florida's
new
gain
time
statute
in
the
computation
of
gain
time
makes
the
statute
an
ex
post
facto
law
as
applied
to
petitioner.
this
same
issue
was
rejected
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
as
i
understand
it,
the
basis
for
the
ex
post
facto
claim
is
that
section
944.275
permits
the
accumulation
of
a
lesser
amount
of
gain
time
than
did
the
old
statute,
section
944.27.
the
respondent
contends
that
florida's
new
gain
time
statute
is
not
ex
post
facto,
because
it
does
not
apply
a
new
punitive
measure
to
a
crime
already
consummated
to
the
detriment
or
material
disadvantage
of
the
wrongdoer.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
necessary
ingredient
in
order
to
support
an
ex
post
facto
claim,
and
this
court
so
held,
i
believe,
in
dobbert
v.
florida.
the
statute
is
remedial
and
constitutes
a
procedural
change
in
the
statutory
mechanism
designed
for
the
purpose
of
granting
gain
time
to
deserving
prisoners.
the
statute
deprives
petitioner
of
nothing
that
he
has
already
earned,
and
at
this
point
let
me
urge
upon
the
court
that
i
believe
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
under
this
court's
holding
in
beazell
v.
ohio,
that
the
prohibition
against
ex
post
facto
laws
does
not
limit
the
legislative
control
of
remedies
and
modes
of
procedure.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
hopt
v.
utah
ably
pinpoints
the
position
of
the
respondent
here,
and
i
quote
very
briefly.
it
says,
"the
crime
for
which
the
present
defendant
was
indicted,
the
punishment
prescribed
therefor,
and
the
quantity
or
the
degree
of
proof
necessary
to
establish
his
guilt,
all
remain
unaffected.
"
and
i
submit
to
you
that
those
same
remarks
could
be
applied
to
the
statute
that
is
here
under
attack.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
true,
but
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--yes,
i
would
follow
the
same
argument.
i
want
to
point
out,
sir,
that
your
argument
assumes
something
that
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
at
all.
the
statute
in
this
case,
the
gain
time
statute
is
no
part
of
the
sentencing
proceeding
at
all,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
all
right,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
he
would
be
in
trouble;
yes.
because
the
man
had
earned
it.
he
had
earned
the
right,
then;
absolutely.
and
he
would
have
a
colorful
due
process
argument.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
justice
white,
you're
assuming
things
that
i
don't
believe
exist
at
all.
i
can't
accept
that.
i
don't
believe
any
warden
is
going
to
tell
any
prisoner
that
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
would
hope
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
i
want
to
point
out
that
although
the
new
gain
time
statute
does
reduce
the
fixed
amount
of
calendar
statutory
gain
time
from
the
fixed
formula
of
5,
10,
and
15,
to
3,
6,
and
9.
however,
sir,
by
virtue
of
additional
provisions
contained
therein,
the
new
statute
provides
greater
opportunity
to
accumulate
a
greater
amount
of
gain
time
than
did
the
old
statute.
now,
let
me
illustrate
this
with
just
three
examples.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
necessarily.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
more
so;
yes,
sir.
more
than--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--he
could
lose
four
days.
that's
true.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
necessarily.
no,
sir,
i
won't
admit
that
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
under
the
statutory--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--5,
10,
and
15;
no.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
he
can
get
it
in
other
ways.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i'd
still
be
making
the
argument
based
primarily
on
the
fact
that
under
florida
law
parole
and
probation
and
gain
time
are
a
matter
of
legislative
grace.
just
because
we
have
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
prisoner
is
automatically
declared
to
have
a
liberty
interest
therein.
we
have
it.
it
was
given
at
the
grace
of
the
legislature,
and
it
can
be
withdrawn
at
the
grace
of
the
legislature
almost
at
will.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
after
it's
given.
but--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--just
hear
me
out,
please,
sir.
it
can
be
withdrawn,
yes,
because
they
didn't
have
to
give
it
in
the
first
place.
but
in
so
doing
they
cannot
deprive
a
man
of
the
gain
time
that
he
has
already
earned;
oh,
no.
i'm
not
arguing
that
and
i
don't
wish
to
be
understood
that
way
at
all.
they
can
withdraw
it,
but
the
gain
time
the
man
has
already
earned,
he
cannot
be
deprived
of
that
by
a
legislative
act.
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that
case
is
an
illustration
of
what
we
spoke
about
just
minutes
ago.
in
the
scafati
case
and
under
massachusetts,
the
good
time
credits
adhere
in
the
sentence
imposed.
after
scafati
was
sentenced
and
he
went
to
the
penal
institution,
he
was
then
paroled
and
he
was
returned
therefore
because
he
violated
the
parole.
now
then,
in
the
interim,
in
the
interim,
after
scafati
was
sentenced,
if
the
court
please,
they
passed
a
law
which
says
that
if
a
man
is
paroled
and
violates
the
conditions
thereof
and
is
returned
to
the
penal
institution,
he
is
deprived
of
good
time
credits
for
the
first
six
months
after
his
return.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
that's
it.
now,
and
since,
sir,
the
good
time
adheres
in
the
sentence
under
massachusetts
law,
if
the
court
please,
the
original
sentence
imposed
is
necessarily
lengthened;
has
to
be.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely;
absolutely.
and
that
is
a
marked
distinction.
there
are
two
kinds
of
good
time
statutes
on
the
books,
those
which
adhere
in
the
sentencing
and
those
which
are
no
part
of
it,
just
as
this
man
here.
the
good
time
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
he
received
his
time
in
1976
was
no
part
of
the
sentencing
proceedings
whatsoever.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
beg
pardon?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
makes
it
a
very
strong
distinction,
absolutely,
sir;
absolutely.
because
if
it
adheres
in
his
summons,
if
the
court
please,
then
he
cannot
be
deprived
of
it
by
an
ex
post
facto
law.
but
under
the
florida
law
it
does
not
so
do,
and
it
does
not
apply
retroactively.
the
statute
which
is
attacked
here
does
not
apply
retroactively
at
all.
in
fact,
it
gives
the
man
more
of
an
opportunity
to
earn
gain
time
than
he
had
under
the
old
statute.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out,
if
i
may,
please,
three
distinctions
on
this,
because
i
think
they
are
material.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court
touched
on
that
in
the
harris
case;
no,
sir.
they
did
rely
on
the
fact
that
under
dear
v.
mayo,
mayo
v.
lukers,
and
other
cases,
that
under
florida
law
that
probation,
parole,
and
gain
time
are
a
matter
of
legislative
grace
and
can
be
changed,
modified,
withdrawn,
at
any
time,
as
long,
sir,
as
they
don't
deprive
the
man
of
anything
that
he
has
previously
gained
under
the
old
law.
now,
that
would
be
wrong.
i'll
admit
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
the
maximum
went
down
but
the
minimum
went
up.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
there
is
more
discretion.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
that's
true.
if
he
violates
the
rules
of
the
institution,
gain
time
can
be
taken
away
from
him.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
the
greenholtz
case
touches
on
that.
a
man
doesn't
acquire
a
vested
interest
in
parole
just
because
there
is
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
but
now,
if
he
is
eligible,
and
the
requirements
are
not
changed
and
the
parole
board
applies
wrong
criteria
or
impermissible
criteria,
then
you
have
a
different
case.
but
that
isn't
the
problem
with--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--it
is
grace.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
because
even
though
it
is
grace,
the
state
gave
the
grace
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
as
long
as
they
don't
deprive
him
of
anything,
they
can;
yes.
as
long
as
they
don't
deprive
him
of
anything.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
due
process
or
anything
else.
absolutely.
but
the
man
has
a
vested
interest
in
parole.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
then
they
can't
deprive
him
of
it
by
saying
we're
going
to
withdraw
the
parole
statute.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
all
of
the
constitution
applies,
i'm
sure,
as
you
well
know,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir,
the
procedural
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
does
apply
to
grace,
absolutely
it
does.
it
can
be
released
in
that
way,
if
a
man
by
the
withdrawal
of
that
grace,
he's
been
deprived
of
a
protectable
interest.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
if
you
look
to
nothing
more,
sir,
than
the
rigid
formula
of
5,
10,
and
15,
as
compared
with
the
new
statute's
3,
6,
and
9.
if
you
look
only
to
that,
you
exclude
everything
else,
then
he
loses;
that's
true.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
i
hope
you'll
read
mine
too.
that's
fine
if
you
look
at
his
reply
brief,
because
that's
all
he
wants
the
court
to
view
is
the
reduction
in
the
5,
10,
15.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
fine,
but
it's
my
argument,
and
i
haven't
yet
been
able
to
get
it
out,
that
by
addition,
by
virtue
of
additional
provisions
contained
in
the
new
statute,
that
the
man
has
a
right
to
earn
a
greater
amount
of
gain
time
under
the
new
statute
than
he
had
under
the
old.
absolutely.
and
i'd
like
to
give...
still
like
to
give
you
three
examples
of
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
i
certainly
am.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
would
not
be
here
making
the
same
argument
that
i
am.
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
may
be
in
theory,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
afraid
it
would
be
not.
hopefully
that
it
would,
that
i
could
prevail
on
an
argument
that
the
gain
time
is
a
matter
of
legislative
grace,
that
the
man
didn't
have
any
right
whatsoever
to
assume
that
this
gain
time
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced,
was
going
to
stay
in
effect
and
not
be
changed.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
all
he
has
in
support
of
his
argument
here.
it's
all
he
has...
he's
saying
here,
and
he
has
to
say
here,
that
he
has
a
constitutionally
protectable
interest
in
gain
time
to
be
earned
at
a
given
rate
in
the
future.
he
has
to
maintain
that
or
else
i
don't
see
how
be
can
prevail
in
this
court.
and
under
the
case
law
that
i
have
in
my
brief,
i
don't
believe
that
he
has
a
protectable
interest
under
the
constitution.
if
he
doesn't
have
a
protectable
interest,
then
against
what
is
the
ex
post
facto
clause
supposed
to
operate?
against
what
evil
is
the
ex
post
facto
clause
supposed
to
protect
him
if
in
the
first
instance
he
doesn't
have
a
constitutionally
protected
interest?
i
say
to
you
that
in
that
case
he
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
placed
in
a
materially
more
disadvantaged
position
than
he
was
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
new
statute,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
it
would,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
would
indeed.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
think
it
would;
i
think
it
would,
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
would,
because
that
we're
dealing
with
something
that
is
taking
place
at
sentencing.
that
is,
the
new
law
that
you
assume
to
be
passed
will
have
made
the
imposition
of
the
15-year
sentence
mandatory,
and
that
would
be
harsher.
i
think
that
that
would
be
ex
post
facto.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
know
what
they'd
do
in
that
case
at
all,
i
really
don't.
you
can
guess
this
way
or
that
way,
but
it's
hard
to
say.
i
can't
even
predict
what
this
court
is
going
do
in
the
case.
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
thing
in
the
new
statute,
and
this,
i
think,
is
new
in
penology.
the
new
statute
permits
the
accumulation
of
gain
time
by
any
prisoner
who
because
of
age,
illness,
because
he's
infirm,
or
for
some
other
reason
he
cannot
participate
in
a
work
release
program;
now,
even
though
he
can't
build
gain
time
in
a
work
release
program,
he
can
still
be
given
gain
time
because
the
man
is
old.
he's
ill,
and
under
the
old
statute
there
was
no
comparable
provision
at
all.
and
one
more--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--i
don't
know.
i've
never
seen
the
man.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
it
could
help
him.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
it
can
help
him,
yes.
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
new
statute
has
more
generous
provisions
in
it
than
did
the
old.
for
example,
you
can
go
to
school.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
he
wants
to
go
to
school
or
not;
he
may.
but
if
he
participates
in
an
approved
course
of
education,
this
means
that
he
can
receive
gain
time
therefor,
and
under
the
old
statute
this
could
not
have
been
done
at
all.
i
rely
also
on
singleton
v.
shafer,
trantino
v.
department
of
corrections.
all
of
those
cases
are
in
the
brief
that
i
have
submitted
to
the
court
and
i
write
much
better
than
i
speak,
so
i'll
leave
that
with
you
at
this
time.
thank
you.
