mr.
macdonald,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
you
suggest
that
a
state
could
not
abolish
parole
entirely?
chief
justice
burger
your
case
really
comes
down
to
the
proposition
that
you
expressed
when
you
said,
the
state
which
had
a
parole
system
could
not
abolish
it
with
respect
to
prisoners
already
convicted
while
that
parole
system
was
on
the
books.
chief
justice
burger
how
do
you
distinguish?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
a
state
adopts
a
code
of
evidence
under
the
new
code,
after
a
given
person
has
committed
a
crime,
before
he
is
tried,
before
he
is
charged
with
the
crime.
and
in
the
new
code
certain
evidence
which
was
previously
inadmissible
is
now
made
admissible.
is
that
ex
post
facto?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
judicial
system,
or
the
society
must
respond
to
what
the
convicted
criminal
thinks
about
the
whole
problem,
by
that
bottom
line
suggestion?
chief
justice
burger
well,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
person
pleads
guilty
or
is
found
guilty,
for
this
purpose?
chief
justice
burger
--that's
quite
a
different
thing
from
what
the
defendant
expects
or
anticipates,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
it
takes
away
the
incentive
to
behave
himself
in
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allbritton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
macdonald?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
weaver
against
florida
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren

burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
