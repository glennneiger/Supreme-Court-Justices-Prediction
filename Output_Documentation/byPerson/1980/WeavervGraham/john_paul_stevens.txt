justice
stevens
mr.
macdonald,
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question.
i
understand
that
generally
the
ex
post
facto
cases
speak
in
terms
of
the
date
of
the
offense.
justice
stevens
but
would
it
not
be
more
appropriate
in
this
case
to
focus
on
the
date
of
the
sentencing
or
the
date
of
the
conviction,
because--
justice
stevens
--as
of
the
date
of
the
trial
the
judge
could
adjust
or...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
the
offense
occurred
before
and
then
he
was
tried
afterwards,
i
couldn't
see
there'd
be
any
unfairness.
justice
stevens
mr.
macdonald,
before
you
close,
do
you
have
any
response
to
the
state's
argument
that
by
virtue
of
liberalizing
the
opportunities
for
extra
gain
time,
that
the
package
as
a
whole
is
actually
more--
justice
stevens
before
you
do
that,
if
i
may
just
be
clear
on
one
thing.
if
i
remember
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion,
they
don't
rely
at
all
on
this
particular
argument
you're
about
to
make,
do
they?
they
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
state
can
reduce,
change
the
formula
in
a
way
adverse
to
the
present...
so
this
is
a
separate
argument;
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida's--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
your
basic
theory
before
we
get
to
whether
the
package
is
better
or
worse.
under
your
view
that
there's
a
difference
between
gain
time
already
earned,
and
gain
time
that
would
be
earned
after
the
statute
became
effective,
what
if
the
man
had
after,
say,
three
years
in
prison,
become
eligible
to
be
considered
for
parole,
but
two
weeks
before
his
parole
hearing
was
set
the
new
statute
was
passed
saying,
you
don't
become
eligible
for
parole
unless
you've
been
in
for
at
least
ten
years,
or
something
like
that,
so
he
lost
eligibility
for
parole,
but
did
not
lose
parole
itself.
would
that
be
retroactive
or
not?
justice
stevens
till
he
actually
gets
it.
justice
stevens
let's
modify
that
just
to
this...
supposing
the
statute
said,
your
sentence
shall
be
from
one
to
15
years
and
the
warden,
depending
on
how
you
behave
in
prison,
shall
decide
when
you
get
out,
within
that
range.
and
then
after
he
starts
to
serve,
with
no
definite
promise
of
when
he'll
get
out,
a
new
statute
is
passed
saying
everybody
in
that
category
must
serve
the
full
15
years.
would
that
violate
the
ex
post
facto
law?
he
wouldn't
have
had
any
right
to
get
out
when
the
statute
was
passed.
it
would
be
just
like
this
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
it
would
be
like
this
case?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
change
it
a
little
bit.
instead
of
saying,
serve
15
years,
he
gets
out
when
the
warden
xx
parole
him
within
the
15-year
period,
and
then
later
on
you
pass
a
statute
saying,
we
don't
have
any
more
parole.
