justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
have
your
federal
jurisdiction
here?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
1331
requires
$10,000?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
we
should
treat
it
as
if
it
had
been
filed
after
the
amendment
eliminated
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
then
you
run
into
a
question,
do
you
not,
as
to
whether
this
is
a
proper
1343
jurisdiction
case
under
the
houston
welfare
rights
v.
chapman
decision
of
this
court?
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
is
no
doubt
there's
a
1983
cause
of
action
but
thiboutot
came
from
a
state
court--
justice
rehnquist
--which
is
a
court,
presumably
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
we
affirmed
the
state
court.
here
the
federal
courts
are
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
section
1343
is
more
limited,
we
held
in
houston,
than
is
1983.
justice
rehnquist
at
what
level
were
these
decisions
rendered?
justice
rehnquist
can
you...
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
rehnquist
now,
what
is
a
piq?
is
that
issued
by
a
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
can
we
find
it
in
cfr
or?
justice
rehnquist
where
would
one
look
for
it?
justice
rehnquist
which
of
those
most
strongly
supports
your
position?
justice
rehnquist
and
where
are
they?
i
mean,
what
citations?
where
would
one
look
for
them?
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
in
your
blue
brief?
justice
rehnquist
at
what
page?
if
you
don't
have
it
right
off
hand,
just
go
on,
if
it's
in
the
brief.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
rehnquist
now,
when
you
say
hhs,
you're
referring
to
the
piq
that
you
referred
to?
justice
rehnquist
i
realize
that.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
when
you
say
it
is
determined
that
this
is
in
doubt,
you're
referring
to
the
piq
that
you--
justice
rehnquist
--but
can
you
identify
them
any
further
than
saying
that
they're
in
the
cch?
they're
not
in
the
federal--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
the
regional
director
may
have
made
a
mistaken
interpretation
of
the
secretary's
views,
though.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
agree,
but
with
not
having
the
piq
in
front
of
me
i'm
unable
to
form
a
judgment.
justice
rehnquist
in
your
point
that
the
regulation
permits
differential
only
on
the
basis
of
resources.
in
effect,
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
could
and
partially
was
held
by
the
9th
circuit
to
be
just
that,
pertinent
based
on
differential
resources,
was
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
could
it
not
just
as
easily
have
held
that
it
was
a
treatment
differential...
agreed...
but
based
on
difference
in
resources
which
is
permitted
under
regulations?
justice
rehnquist
well,
look
at
your
brief
on
page
22
and
the
two
regulations
you've
just
cited,
which
say
that
the
two
categories
must
be
treated
identically
except
for
income
and
resources.
justice
rehnquist
your
blue
brief.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
california--
--the
state
could
turn
them
down,
i
take
it,
then?
justice
rehnquist
it
could
notify
them
to
apply,
but
it
could
turn
them
down.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
would
be
in
a
state
proceeding?
