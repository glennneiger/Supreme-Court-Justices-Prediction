we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
beltran
v.
myers.
mr.
deford,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
now,
what's
the
underlying
policy
purpose
behind
that
kind
of
a
statute?
chief
justice
burger
that
sort
of
pattern
has
permeated
the
statutes
right
back
to
the
original
welfare
cases
30
or
40
years
ago,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
parents
can't
give
their
home
or
their
bank
account
or
their
stocks
and
bonds
to
their
children
and
then
go
on
relief
or?
chief
justice
burger
what
is
the
consequence
of
the
9th
circuit
opinion?
is
it
anything
more
than
that
the
children
or
the
other
transferees
who
receive
the
parents'
money,
bank
accounts,
stocks,
or
whatever,
must
disgorge
and
use
that
money
to
pay?
chief
justice
burger
of
course,
there's
some
importance
as
to
the
motive
of
the
person
who
made
the
transfer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
magasin.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
magasin,
is
it
limited
to
relatives?
chief
justice
burger
any
third
person?
chief
justice
burger
to
children.
chief
justice
burger
the
letter
merely
raises
an
issue
and
there
must
be
a
proceeding
of
some
kind
to
determine
whether
that
suggestion
is
correct.
chief
justice
burger
so
you're
telling
us,
in
effect,
that
whatever
the
position
was
of
the
regional
director
or
washington
on
this
subject,
it
was
never
pursued,
never
carried
out?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
there
was
no
request
here?
chief
justice
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
regulation
or
the
statute
which
has
the
presumption
reach
the
level
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption
after
a
lapse
of
time?
or
is
there
no
time
factor?
chief
justice
burger
no,
the
period...
they
could
have
had
a
hearing;
they
didn't
ask
for
one.
they
didn't
pursue
any
such
remedy.
at
some
point
that
presumption
must
achieve
a
greater
status
by
the
failure
to
challenge
it,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
0
[recess.]
you
may
continue,
mr.
magasin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
burger
would
you
have
to
say
anything
about
the
failure
to
ask
for
a
hearing
for
a
determination
to
change
the
presumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
more
of
those
cases
we
get,
the
greater
will
be
the
span
of
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
