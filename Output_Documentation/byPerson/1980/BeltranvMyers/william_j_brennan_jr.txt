justice
jr.
what
did
you
say
piq
stands
for?
justice
jr.
wait
till
next
year.
justice
jr.
well,
didn't
your
brother
tell
us
that
recently
a
regional
director,
i
think,
has
advised
california
that
it's
not
in
compliance?
justice
jr.
how
long
has
this
case
been
going
on?
justice
jr.
and
meanwhile
california
has
been
administering
its
transfer
of
assets
rule?
justice
jr.
how
long
may
benefits
be
denied?
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
the
value
had
been
eaten
up
by
the?
justice
jr.
i
see.
was
that
for
a
long
period,
in
her
case?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
weren't
these
assets
houses
that
she...
that
they
turned
over?
justice
jr.
was
it
one
house
or
two
houses?
justice
jr.
i
thought
there
were
two
houses.
justice
jr.
yes,
and
then
one...
the
elderly
couple,
they're
in
their
late
80s,
aren't
they?
justice
jr.
88
or
something?
i
thought
they
continued
to
live
there?
justice
jr.
well,
how
do
you
go
about
evaluating
under
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
what's
been
transferred?
justice
jr.
a
homestead,
for
example,
might
be
if
it's
the
only
place
an
elderly
couple
like
this
can
live?
justice
jr.
was
this
valuation
arrived
at
at
some
kind
of
formal
hearing
or
what?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
since
suspension
of
assistance
is
only
for
so
long
as
it
takes
to
exhaust
the
value
of
the
transferred
asset,
there
must
be
some
proceeding
by
which
the
value
is
put
on
those
transferred
assets,
isn't
there?
justice
jr.
who
makes
that
determination?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
jr.
and
is
there
a
hearing
that?
justice
jr.
and
we
put
a
value
on
your
transfer
of
$50,000
and
until
that's
eaten
up
you
are
no
longer
entitled
to
assistance.
