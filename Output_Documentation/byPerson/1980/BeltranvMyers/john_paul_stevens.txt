justice
stevens
mr.
deford,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
as
i
understand
your
statement
of
the
facts,
she
was
eligible
for
ssi
benefits?
justice
stevens
oh,
but
she
was
not
actually
receiving
them?
she
couldn't
claim
under
subparagraph
(a)
then?
see,
i
thought--
justice
stevens
--well,
then,
it
seems
to
me,
if
your
facts
are
right,
she's
eligible
under
(a)
and
you
don't
even
have
to
reach
the
comparability
clause.
justice
stevens
mr.
magasin,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
can
i
just
ask
you
a
question
about
that.
supposing
the
transfer
is
of
sufficient
assets
to
bring
the
transferor
down
into
an
income
level
that
will
make
him
or
her
eligible
for
ssi
benefits,
would
he
not
then
be
eligible
under
subparagraph
(a)?
justice
stevens
and
it
was
deliberate
and
all
the
rest.
but
as
i
understand
it,
we're
really
only
dealing
with
the
transfers
that
are
not
quite
as
large
as
they
might
have
been
and
even
under
your
view
they
could
transfer
some
more
assets
in
order
to
get
down
under
the
ssi
level
and
then
become
eligible.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
then
if
they're
qualified
for
ssi,
they
automatically
get
the
medicaid
too,
even
if
they
got
to
be
qualified
by
reason
of
a
transfer
of
assets?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
comparable
refers
to?
comparable
to
what,
in
your
view
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
my
question
is,
how
do
you
read
it?
justice
stevens
i
still
don't
understand
how
you
read
it.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
that
the
standards
for
determining
ssi
eligibility
must
be
comparable
to
the
standards
for
determining
medicaid
eligibility?
justice
stevens
and
in
ssi
eligibility,
it
does
prohibit
the
transfer
of
assets
rule?
justice
stevens
so
if
the
comparability
concept
includes
it,
you'd
say
the
the
same
rule
would
apply?
