mr.
gill
deford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
of
this
case
is
the
disparate
treatment
of
a
discrete
class
of
medicaid
recipients
by
the
state
of
california.
california's
decision
to
participate
in
the
federal
medicaid
system
guarantees
that
it
will
be
reimbursed
50
percent
of
its
cost
by
the
federal
government.
however,
at
the
same
time
california
is
obligated
to
comply
with
controlling
federal
law.
mr.
gill
deford
in
the
district
court?
mr.
gill
deford
we
had
it...
we
alleged
jurisdiction
under
both
1331
and
under
1343.
the
federal
district
court
found
jurisdiction
under
both
of
those
grants.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
not
to
look
at
1343,
but
did
find
jurisdiction
under
1331.
either
of
them
are
cause
of
actions
1983.
mr.
gill
deford
at
the
time
this
case
was
brought
it
did.
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
found
there
was
$10,000
in
controversy.
since
then,
of
course,
the
statute
has
been
amended
to
eliminate
the
$10,000.
mr.
gill
deford
yes.
mr.
gill
deford
for
instance,
the
main
plaintiff,
your
honor,
has
bills
to
the
nursing
home
in
excess
of
$14,000
because
of
unpaid
nursing
home
bills.
mr.
gill
deford
at
the
time
the
case
was
brought
she
would
not
have
had
bills
in
the
amount
of
$10,000.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
since
the
case
was
still
going
on
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
changed,
i
would
think
that
even
if
there
was
less
than
$10,000
in
controversy
when
it
was
brought,
she
would
have
had
jurisdiction
under
1331
in
any
event.
mr.
gill
deford
i
believe
the
amendment
allowed
for
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
courts
for
any
case
then
pending.
in
any
event,
as
i've
said,
there
was
also
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
found
under
1343,
which
does
not
require
an
amount
in
controversy.
mr.
gill
deford
that
was
what
the
9th
circuit
was
concerned
about.
however,
your
honor,
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
of
last
summer
in
state
of
maine
v.
thiboutot
there
is
definitely
a
1983
cause
of
action.
mr.
gill
deford
that's
correct.
mr.
gill
deford
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
did
allege
both
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
under
1983,
and
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
in
hagans
v.
lavine,
chapman
did
not
alter
the
hagans
v.
lavine
decision,
so
there
is
pendent
jurisdiction
over
the
statutory
claims
which
we
raised
in
the
district
court
and
which
are
now
before
this
court.
the
specific
concern
here
is
with
the
state's
application
of
what
is
commonly
known
as
a
transfer
of
assets
or
divestment
rule
against
one
group
of
medicaid
recipients
known
as
the
medically
needy
while
a
corresponding
group
of
medicaid
recipients
known
as
the
categorically
needy
are
not
subject
to
such
a
rule
and
as
even
california
admits
cannot
be
subject
to
such
a
rule
under
federal
law.
mr.
gill
deford
the
transfer
of
assets
statute?
my
assumption
is,
based
on
the
briefs
filed
by
the
state
of
california
that
the
purpose
is
to
avoid
individuals
who
have
sufficient
wealth
to
take
care
of
themselves
from
forcing
themselves
onto
the
public
welfare
rolls.
mr.
gill
deford
i
believe
that's
true;
yes,
sir.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
that
was
exactly
what
congress
has
said
can
be
done,
both
with
respect
to
the
federal
government's
supplemental
security
income
program,
which
provides
cash
assistance
and
with
respect
to
the
categorically
needy
who
are
those
medicaid
recipients,
especially
the
aged,
blind,
and
disabled,
who
are
eligible
for
ssi
supplemental
security
income,
and
are
then
automatically
eligible
for
medicaid
as
categorically
needy.
the
medically
needy,
by
contrast,
although
they
are
also
aged,
blind,
and
disabled,
are
not
eligible
for
ssi
cash
benefits,
but
congress
has
determined
that
they
should
be
eligible
for
medicaid
once
they
have
spent
down
their
income
to
the
level
of
impoverishment
determined
by
congress
and
by
the
federal
agency.
as
far
as
congress
is
concerned,
once
a
medically
needy
individual,
when
his
income
is
over
the
categorical
eligibility
levels,
spends
down,
that
person
is
to
be
treated
the
same
as
if
he
or
she
had
originally
been
found
eligible
for
medicaid
automatically
as
categorically
needy.
the
state
has
argued
throughout
that
its
transfer
rule
applied
only
to
the
medically
needy
does
not
violate
the
federal
medicaid
statute.
it
is
our
feeling,
however,
that
the
statute
is
supported
by
its
legislative
history
and
by
the
repeated
statements
of
the
responsible
federal
agency,
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
does
not
permit
more
restrictive
treatment
against
the
medically
needy
than
against
the
categorically
needy.
the
9th
circuit
to
a
great
extent
agreed
with
us
on
that
point,
that
there
was
a
general
requirement
of
comparability
between
the
medically
and
categorically
needy.
where
the
9th
circuit
disagreed,
however,
was
in
determining
that
the
transfer
rule
was
not
necessarily
a
violation
of
the
comparability
requirement,
as
there
were
other
rules
which
were
the
same
between
the
categorically
and
medically
needy.
therefore,
the
9th
circuit
determined
that
one
different
rule
wouldn't
necessarily
violate
a
comparability
requirement.
this
interpretation,
however,
directly
contradicts
the
longstanding
decisions,
the
consistent
and
longstanding
interpretations
of
the
responsible
federal
agency,
hhs,
and
its
predecessor,
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
mr.
gill
deford
these
decisions
were
rendered
from
the
main
offices
in
washington,
sent
out
to
the
regional
offices
throughout
the
country,
which
then
have
notified
the
various
state
administrators
on
various
occasions.
mr.
gill
deford
the
only...
we
do
not
have
in
the
record
the
original
statement
which
is
known
as
a
piq.
piq
no.
77
was
sent
out
in,
i
believe,
in
1977,
to
the
various
regional
administrators
informing
them
specifically
that
transfer
of
assets
rules
could
not
be
applied
only
to
the
medically
needy.
what
is
in
the
record,
however,
is
a
letter
that
the
regional
administrator
for
the
region
which
california
is
in,
sent
to
defendant
myers
informing
her
that
the
california
rule
was
violative
of
the
federal
law.
mr.
gill
deford
it's
not
a
regulation.
it
is
a
specific
guideline
establishing
how
hew
and
now
hhs
interprets
the
way
the
statutes
and
regulations
of
the
federal
government
should
work
together.
mr.
gill
deford
no,
it's
not
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
mr.
gill
deford
presumably...
it's
not
published,
your
honor.
one
has
to
be
a
regional
administrator
or
to
have
received
a
copy
from
hhs
in
washington.
on
the
other
hand,
there
have
been
other
published
documents
from
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
which
have
appeared
in
various
other
publications
which
indicate
specifically
on
this
point,
and
then
again
on
the
general
point
of
comparability
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy,
that
this
treatment
is
impermissible.
mr.
gill
deford
all
of
the
documents
which
i'm
referring
to
now
state
both
the
general
rule
and
a
specific
rule.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
as
i
said,
none
of
them
are
code
of
federal
regulations
documents.
one
of
the
publications
that
we
have
cited
is
published
in
the
cch
medicare
and
medicaid
guide.
it
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
and
it
is
a
document
which
hhs
says,
"we
have
been
besieged
with
a
number
of
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
one
can
apply
the
transfer
rule
only
to
the
medically
needy.
"
the
question
is
very
specifically
answered
with
specific
references
to
the
regulations
and
to
the
statute.
mr.
gill
deford
there
is
a
citation
to
that
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
deford
i
don't
have
it
but
it
is
in
there.
mr.
gill
deford
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know.
mr.
gill
deford
yes,
definitely,
your
honor.
the
interpretation
which
plaintiffs
are
offering
of
the
statute
and
of
the
regulations
is
not
one
which
we
have
invented
off
the
top
of
our
heads.
it
is
one
which
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
then
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
its
predecessor,
have
repeatedly
and
consistently
announced.
in
evaluating
that
reasonable
and
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
2nd
circuit,
the
4th
circuit,
a
federal
judge
in
boston,
and
a
new
york
state
appellate
court
have
all
agreed
that
it
is
a
reasonable
determination
of
the
responsible
federal
agency.
mr.
justice
marshall
last
summer
in
denying
new
york's
request
for
a
stay
in
the
caldwell
v.
blum
case,
also
noted
that
it
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
social
security
act.
i'd
like
to
briefly
go
through
the
facts
of
this
case
because
i
do
think
they
provide
an
important
lesson
in
how
california
applies
its
transfer
of
assets
rule.
for
the
most
part
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
this
case
was
resolved
in
the
district
court
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
two
major
important
facts
undisputed
are
these,
that
antonia
beltran
did
transfer
property
for
less
than
fair
market
value,
and
secondly,
that
but
for
that
transfer
and
the
application
of
california's
transfer
of
assets
rule,
she
would
have
been
eligible
at
all
relevant
times
for
medically
needy
medicaid
coverage.
specifically,
in
february,
1977,
she
and
her
husband
gave
their
property
to
their
three
adult
children.
at
that
time
mrs.
beltran
was
not
medi-cal.
as
far
as
the
record
shows
she
was
not
even
aware
that
medi-cal
existed.
i
should
note
that
medi-cal
was
california's
name
for
the
federal
medicaid
program.
three
months
later,
at
the
insistence
of
her
doctor,
she
applied
for
and
received
categorical
coverage
in
the
form
of
a
homemaker
chore
services
individual
who
is
paid
by
the
state
to
come
in
and
help
people
who
are
unable
to
cook
and
take
care
of
themselves.
at
the
same
time
the
social
worker
determined
that
she
was
eligible
for
medicaid.
as
near
as
we
can
determine,
it's
never
been
specifically
cleared
up
if
that
was
categorically
needy
medicaid
coverage
that
she
was
found
eligible
for.
so
that
within
three
months
of
the
transfer
she
was
found
eligible
for
medicaid.
about
ten
months
later
she
was
forced
to
go
into
the
nursing
home.
at
that
time,
of
course,
her
homemaker
chore
services
were
cut
off.
for
reasons
which
have
never
been
clarified,
she
remained
eligible
for
medi-cal
until
august
of
1978.
she
was
then
found
ineligible
and
she
reapplied
two
months
later.
at
that
time
she
was
forced
to
apply
as
a
medically
needy
individual,
not
a
categorically
needy
individual.
several
months
after
that
the
state
for
the
first
time
found
her
ineligible
for
medicaid,
based
on
the
transfer
of
assets
which
had
taken
place
in
february,
1977.
thus,
in
the
course
of
two
years,
she
was
first...
after
the
transfer,
she
was
first
found
eligible
for
medicaid
as
categorically
needy,
and
then
found
ineligible
for
medicaid
as
medically
needy.
after
being
denied
eligibility
she
filed
a
motion
to
intervene
in
the
then-pending
dawson
v.
beach
case,
which
was
on
the
verge
of
being
resolved
by
summary
judgment
motions.
the
defendants
did
not
oppose
that
motion,
and
she
was
permitted
to
intervene.
i
should
also
add,
it's
not
on
the
record,
but
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
know
that
after
the
9th
circuit's
decision
in
may,
1980,
mrs.
beltran
reapplied
for
medically
needy
eligibility
on
the
premise
that
the
period
of
ineligibility
which
the
state
had
previously
determined
was
too
long.
she
was
found
eligible
at
that
time,
retroactive
to
march
1,
1980.
as
a
result,
mrs.
beltran's
period
of
ineligibility
ran
for
16
months,
from
september,
1978,
to
february,
1980.
during
that
period,
as
i've
noted,
she
ran
up
nursing
home
bills
of
just
under.
$15,000
and
those
bills
remain
unpaid.
mr.
gill
deford
i
don't
think
she
ever
received
ssi
benefits
because
i
don't
think
she
applied
for
ssi
benefits.
mr.
gill
deford
she
was
eligible
for
ssi
benefits
and
i
believe
that
because
the
state
has
admitted
she
was--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
believe
subparagraph
(b)
allows
an
individual
to
claim
whether
or
not
they
are
receiving
the
benefits.
mr.
gill
deford
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
when
she
went
into
the
nursing
home
she
could
no
longer
apply
or
be
eligible
for
ssi
benefits.
she
had
to
apply
as
medically
needy
at
that
point,
and
so
that
changed
the
whole
process.
the
basis
of
our
argument,
and
that
on
which
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
has
rested
its
interpretation,
is
42
usc...
i'm
sorry
to
give
this
lengthy
cite,
but
it's
the
only
one
we
have...
section
1396a(a)(10)(c)(i),
which
is
as
far
down
as
the
medicaid
statute
goes.
mr.
gill
deford
that
statute
defines
the
medically
needy
and
it
defines
them
as
identical
to
the
categorically
needy
in
every
respect
save
one,
and
that
is
that
they
have
greater
income
or
resources,
greater
gross
income
or
resources
before
the
cost
of
medical
care
is
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
gill
deford
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
i
believe
it
is.
congress
concluded
that
the
medically
needy,
once
their
medical
costs
were
taken
into
consideration,
were
virtually
identical
with
the
categorically
needy.
they
were
equally
impoverished
and
therefore
equally
deserving
of
medicaid
coverage.
that
statute
essentially
says
that
except
for
income
and
resources,
this
individual
is
identical
with
an
ssi
recipient,
is
identical
with
someone
eligible
for
categorical
coverage.
the
statute
essentially
asks
the
state
to
make
this
inquiry:
but
for
this
individual's
income
and
resources,
which
are
over
the
categorical
levels,
would
this
individual
be
eligible
for
ssi?
if
the
answer
is
ssi
recipient,
the
same
is
a
categorically
needy
individual.
consequently,
hhs
has
determined
regularly
and
repeatedly
that
on
the
basis
of
this
statute
a
state
cannot
apply
more
restrictive
rules
to
the
medically
needy
than
to
the
categorically
needy.
as
a
result
of
that
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
apply
transfer
rules
only
to
the
medically
needy
and
to
disenfranchise
them
from
eligibility
when
the
identically
situated
categorically
needy
individual
remains
eligible
for
benefits
regardless
of
any
transfers
that
that
person
may
have
undertaken.
mr.
gill
deford
hhs
is
the
department
of
health
and
human
services--
mr.
gill
deford
--at
the
time
the
piq
came
out
it
was
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
mr.
gill
deford
the
piq
and
other
publications
which
hhs
and
its
predecessor,
hew,
have
put
out
at
various
times
in
the
last
few
years.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
there
is
a...
the
guideline
which
i
was
referring
to
earlier,
your
honor,
is
known
as
the
hcfa...
which
stands
for
health
care
financing
administration,
which
is
the
part
of
hhs
which
is
in
charge
of
medicaid
rules...
regional
office
manual
part
6,
medicaid
guideline
and
transmittal
no.
31.
it
is
that
which
is
reprinted
in
cch
medicare-medicaid
guide,
and
which
we
have
cited
in
the
brief.
and
that
it
bases
its
decision
on
the
regulations
and
on
the
statute
to
determine
that
they
cannot
treat
the
medically
needy
differently
from
the
categorically
needy,
and
therefore
cannot
apply
the
transfer
rule.
that
is
the
official
guideline
issued
by
hhs.
mr.
gill
deford
the
state
does
have
to
submit
a
plan.
mr.
gill
deford
that's
correct.
it
has
to
have
a
state
plan
approved--
mr.
gill
deford
--the
plan
has
retained
approval.
mr.
gill
deford
no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
has
moved
against
the
state
of
california--
mr.
gill
deford
--well,
it
began,
i
believe,
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
this--
mr.
gill
deford
--yes.
it's
specifically
on
this
issue.
hhs
has
informed
california
that
it
is
out
of
compliance
with
federal
law--
mr.
gill
deford
--yes,
it
is.
a
letter
that
was
sent
to
defendant
myers--
mr.
gill
deford
--yes,
it's
attached--
mr.
gill
deford
--no,
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
it's
attached,
i
believe,
to
our
summary
judgment
motion
or
to
our
reply
and
therefore
is
in
the
record.
mr.
gill
deford
as
far
as
i
know,
california
does
not
dispute
that
it
is
applying
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
to
the
medically
needy--
mr.
gill
deford
--no,
it
was
signed
by
the
regional
director
of
the
region
in
which
california
is.
mr.
gill
deford
yes,
but
that
letter
is
based
on
what
hhs
as
an
entity
in
washington
has
said
is
the
proper
authority.
and
the
regional
director
speaks
for
the
secretary,
he's
not
speaking
on
his
own
authority.
mr.
gill
deford
your
honor,
i
don't
think,
given
what
the
piq
says
and
given
what
other
guidelines
say,
that
the
regional
director
could
have
made
a
mistake
on
this
point.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
the
publication
which
i
have
mentioned
which
we
have
cited
sets
this
out
quite
explicitly
and
it
was
a
publication,
it
has
been
a
publication
available
to
all
the
states.
mr.
gill
deford
i'm
not
aware,
your
honor,
of
what
the
rule
is
on
that.
i
should
point
out
that,
as
i
noted
before,
hhs
has
developed
this
policy
with
respect
to
transfer
of
assets
rules
based
on
explicit
regulations.
42
cfr
section
435.401(c)(2)
implements
the
statute
by
stating
with
no
exception
that
a
state
cannot
apply
more
restrictive
rules
to
the
medically
needy
than
to
the
categorically
needy.
that
is
the
general
rule
and
it
is
set
out
quite
explicitly
in
the
regulation.
specifically,
hhs
has
implemented
this
policy
in
435.840(a)
and.841(a)
by
saying
that
a
state
must
use
the
most
liberal
resource
standards
in
determining
medically
needy
eligibility
which
are
used
in
the
categorical
programs
of
afdc
or
ssi.
obviously,
if
there's
no
transfer
rule
applicable
to
ssi
recipients,
the
most
liberal
resource
standard
would
be
no
transfer
rule
for
medically
needy
applicants.
furthermore,
in
435.845(b),
the
regulation
specifically
requires
that
in
determining
available
income
and
resources
a
state
can
only
look
to
those
resources
which
the
individual
has
at
present
or
up
to
six
months
in
the
future.
it
forbids
a
state
implicitly
to
look
at
any
resource
which
the
individual
had
in
the
past,
regardless
of
why
the
individual
no
longer
has
that
resource.
mr.
gill
deford
i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
your
honor.
the
9th
circuit
held
that
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
was
a
financial
condition
of
eligibility.
it
was
quite
explicit
on
that.
mr.
gill
deford
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
aspect
of
the
opinion,
your
honor.
i
guess
i'm
not
following
the
questioning.
mr.
gill
deford
regular
or
reply
brief,
your
honor?
mr.
gill
deford
right.
the
except-for-income-and-resources
clause
means
that...
it
does
not
mean
that
we
eliminate
financial
conditions
of
eligibility
from
this
general
standard.
that
language
is
taken
directly,
quoted
from
the
statute
itself.
all
that
means
is
that
when
evaluating
who
we
have
here,
you
determine
through
the
except-for-income-and-resources
clause
whether
we
have
a
medically
needy
person
or
a
categorically
needy
person.
that
language
is
directly
out
of
the
statute
except
for
income
and
resources.
and
it
means
that
a
state
determines
an
individual
should
be
eligible
for
medically
needy
as
if
they
were
an
ssi
person,
because
we
don't
look
at
income
and
resources,
we
look
only
at
their
categorical
status.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
could.
mr.
gill
deford
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
save
that
for
rebuttal
but
i'll
speak
now
to
that.
the
public
law
96-611,
section
5,
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
december
of
1980
does
modify
the
congressional
policy
towards
transfer
of
assets.
it
allows
a
state
to
implement
a
rule
which
denies
eligibility
to
a
medicaid
recipient
who
has
transferred
assets
in
the
past
with
the
intent
of
attaining
eligibility
for
medicaid.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recognize,
however,
that
that
statute
continues
the
general
congressional
policy
that
the
medically
need
should
be
treated
no
more
restrictively
than
the
categorically
needy.
congress
still
requires
that
both
the
medically
needy
and
categorically
needy
be
treated
the
same.
a
state
would
not
be
able
to
apply
that
transfer
rule
to
only
one
group
or
the
other.
mr.
gill
deford
the
amendment
to
the
statute
does
not
go
into
effect
for
medicaid
reasons
until
july
1,
1981.
consequently,
the
present
law,
whatever
that
is,
will
be
in
effect
until
that
date.
so
there
are
people
now
in
california
who
have
been
and
will
continue
to
be
denied
eligibility
based
on
the
present
california
transfer
of
assets
rule.
mr.
gill
deford
the
general
importance
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
money
involved
both
to
the
state
and
federal
governments
is
obviously
reduced
because
states
will
now
be
able
to
deny
eligibility.
on
the
other
hand,
the
general
rule
of
the
importance
of
comparability
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy
remains
an
important
issue
in
a
number
of
other
areas.
moreover,
there
are
thousands
of
californians
who
have
been
affected
by
this
transfer
rule
who
are
presumably
members
of
this
class,
and
who
now
owe
nursing
homes
many
thousands
of
dollars.
so
it
remains
significant
in
that
respect.
i
admit
that,
obviously,
since
this
law
will
change
on
july
1,
it
does
not
have
the
same
significance
it
had
when
this
court
granted
cert
in
november.
i
would
just
remind
the
court
that
we
did
make
a
motion
summarily
to
reverse
this
case
after
the
new
statute
came
down
and
the
court
denied
that
motion.
we
felt
that
the
new
statute,
and
still
do,
explicitly
suggests,
at
least
in
the
legislative
history,
that
the
entire
focus
of
the
new
legislation
is
to
replace
a
vacuum,
that
prior
to
the
new
legislation
a
state
could
not
utilize
a
transfer
of
assets
rule
but
now
under
the
new
legislation
effective
july
1
it
can
utilize
a
transfer
rule.
and
to
corroborate
that
entire
impression,
the
present
california
law
violates
controlling
federal
law.
mr.
gill
deford
in
many
instances
the
children
don't
have
the
money.
they've
already
used
it.
in
any
event
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue
here,
your
honor.
there's
no
dispute
that
all
these
transfers
were
legal
and
binding
transfers.
what
california
is
doing
is
that
if
anyone
is
at
fault
it
is
probably
the
person
who
received
the
property.
but
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
individual
who
needs
the
medicaid
coverage,
who
needs
the
health
care
coverage.
and
that
individual
is
left
holding
the
bill.
mr.
gill
deford
i
believe
there
is
some
importance
and
congress
has
recognized
that
in
new
legislation,
but
the
motive
as
it's
described
in
the
new
legislation
is
not
nearly
as
restrictive
as
is
described
in
the
present
california
law,
especially
as
the
present
california
law
is
implemented.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
if
i
could.
mr.
gill
deford
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gill
deford
the
appropriate
relief
now
would
be
for
the
district
court
to
notify
the
members
of
the
class
of
the
decision
of
this
court,
if
it
reverses,
and
to
allow
those
individuals
to
apply
for
the
state
administrative
processes
to
obtain
the
amount
of
benefits
which
they
have
been
denied
by
the
illegal
transfer
of
assets
rule
in
the
past.
mr.
gill
deford
no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
quern
v.
jordan
specifically
deals
with
that
issue
in
which
this
court
determined
that
notification
does
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment,
where
a
federal
court
ordered
payment...
in
that
calendar--
mr.
gill
deford
--the
state
could
turn
them
down?
i
believe
the
state
would
have
to
notify
them.
mr.
gill
deford
not
on
the
basis
of
the
transfer
of
assets
rule,
your
honor.
it
would
have
to
notify
them
that
if
they
had
otherwise
been
eligible
except
for
this
rule,
which
has
since
been
declared
invalid,
they
would
have
the
opportunity
of
recovering
the
amount
of
benefits
which
they
had
lost
or
had
otherwise
to
pay
out.
mr.
gill
deford
it
would
be
for
the
state
proceedings
in
compliance
with
quern
v.
jordan
theory.
mr.
gill
deford
probably,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court
could
not
rule
until
nearly
the
time
in
which
the
boren/long
amendment
goes
into
effect
for
medicaid
applicants,
injunctive
relief
would
only
affect
a
very
few
number
of
applicants
in
the
future.
mr.
gill
deford
reimbursement,
i
think,
we
would
need
an
injunctive
relief
order
to
get
reimbursement
for
the
members
of
the
class,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
the
reason
we
didn't
ask
for
determination
is
two-fold.
first,
it
was
faster
to
go
through
a
federal
court.
this
case
was
already
pending,
all
mrs.
beltran
had
to
do
was
to
intervene.
the
administrative
process
in
california
takes
six
to
ten
months.
this
process
only
took
three
months
to
get
a
decision
in
the
district
court.
more
important,
a
decision
of
the
other
main
plaintiff,
mr.
manahan,
should
be
read
by
this
court
to
indicate
the
unlikelihood
that
an
individual
will
succeed
in
an
administrative
hearing.
that
person
actually
won
his
fair
hearing
and
then
was
reversed
by
the
director,
by
the
defendant
in
this
case
without
any
opportunity
to
explain
his
situation.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
it's
just
that
this
case
was
about
to
go
off
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
we
had
virtually
completed
discovery,
so
the
case
was
in
its
final
stages
and
mrs.
beltran's
initial
decision
was--
mr.
gill
deford
--as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it
is.
mr.
gill
deford
thank
you.
