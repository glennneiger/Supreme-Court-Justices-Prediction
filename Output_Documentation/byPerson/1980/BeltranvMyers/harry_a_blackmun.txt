justice
blackmun
yes,
but
where
did
they
find
the
$10,000?
justice
blackmun
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
they
found
it
prospectively?
justice
blackmun
therefore
is
there
1331
jurisdiction?
justice
blackmun
mr.
deford,
somewhere,
at
your
leisure,
will
you
be
sure
to
comment
on
the
boren/long
amendment?
justice
blackmun
well,
do
you
want
to
make
any
comment
on
these
amendments?
justice
blackmun
well,
my
question
is,
in
the
light
of
the
amendment
to
the
statute,
what
continuing
general
importance
does
this
case
have?
justice
blackmun
well,
it'll
be
important,
as
all
these
cases
are,
to
the
litigants
all
right.
i
wondered
what...
isn't
the
general
importance
of
the
issue
on
which
the
courts
of
appeal
have
divided,
much
less
as
a
result
of
the
boren-long
amendment?
