mr.
richard
j.
magasin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
california's
transfer
of
assets
rule
conflicts
with
the
federal
medicaid
statute.
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
denies
benefits
to
a
medically
needy
individual
who
has
transferred
his
assets
so
as
to
qualify
for
medical
assistance.
it
is
apparent
that
the
federal
supremacy
clause
should
not
be
employed
to
void
provisions
of
a
state
program
unless
there
is
clear
congressional
intent
to
do
so.
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
is
designed
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
medicaid
program
by
protecting
the
public
treasury
and
insuring
that
benefits
are
paid
to
those
truly
in
need.
it
denies
eligibility
to
those
individuals
who
manufacture
eligibility
by
transferring
their
assets
to
relatives
in
order
to
qualify
for
medical
assistance.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
no,
it
would
be--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--correct.
the
most
common
situation
would
be
a
transfer
to
relatives.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
children:
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
to
the
extent
that
there
would
be
a
transfer.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
to
the
extent
they
transferred
all
of
their
assets
and
also
with
the
income
and
resource
level
requirements
of
ssi,
conceivably
they
could
qualify
for
ssi
and
be
eligible--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--yes.
the
reason
for
this
is
because
under
the
ssi
program
we're
obligated
to
follow
the
ssi
standard,
so
under
the
ssi
program,
at
least
prior
to
the
boren/long
amendment,
a
transfer
of
assets
even
for
a
valuable
consideration
to
a
relative
or
to
a
friend
would
make
him
eligible.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
the
striking
down
of
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
will
in
effect
serve
to
benefit
the
inheritance
of
relatives
and
this
will
clearly
be
at
the
expense
of
the
taxpayers.
of
course
these
policy
considerations
would
carry
little
weight
in
the
face
of
explicit
federal
statutes
prohibiting
a
state's
transfer
of
assets
rule.
however,
this
is
not
the
case.
the
petitioner
cannot
point
to
a
single
statute
which
specifically
precludes
a
state
from
employing
this
rule.
this
is
even
more
apparent
when
one
reviews
the
facts
in
this
case
in
the
overall
administration
of
the
medicaid
and
medi-cal
programs
and
the
specific
statutes
and
regulations
under
consideration.
the
medicaid
program
was
established
by
title
xix
of
the
social
security
act.
it
is
a
cooperative
federal-state
program.
its
purpose
is
to
provide
medical
assistance
to
needy
individuals.
to
participate
states
must
comply
with
certain
requirements.
first,
they
must
adopt
a
state
plan
which
meets
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
i
may
comment
that
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
as
well
as
the
secretary
of
hew
has
consistently
approved
california's
state
plan
and
in
fact
we've
been
receiving
billions
of
dollars
in
federal
aid.
in
addition,
the
states
must--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--in
1978
we
received
a
letter
from
a
regional
director
advising
california
that
it
was
in
noncompliance.
however,
no
formal
noncompliance
hearings
have
been
held,
which
is
the
prerogative
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
pursuant
to
title
xix.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
this
lawsuit
was
commenced
in
1978.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
after
the
letter.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
precisely.
there's
a
special
administrative
proceeding
whereby
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
affords
notice
and
there's
a
hearing
and
the
secretary
has
the
option
of
cutting
off
funds.
this
has
not
been
the
case
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
the
state
must
provide
medical
assistance
to
a
statutorily
defined
group
of
needy
persons.
this
group
is
called
the
categorically
needy.
now,
to
qualify
as
categorically
needy,
two
criteria
must
be
satisfied.
first,
the
individual
must
be
aged,
blind,
or
disabled,
and
secondly
he
must
qualify
for
financial
assistance
under
either
one
of
two
welfare
programs.
this
includes
the
ssi
program,
the
supplemental
security
income
for
aged,
blind,
and
disabled
under
title
xvi;
or
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
under
title
iv(a).
now,
it
should
be
noted
here
that
the
categorically
needy
are
eligible
for
financial
assistance
under
these
programs
because
they
do
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
for
their
own
essentials.
of
necessity
it
makes
sense
that
states
be
required
to
provide
medical
assistance
to
these
individuals.
now,
there
is
another
group
of
individuals,
and
this
is
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about,
the
medically
needy.
now,
states
have
the
option
of
covering
the
medically
needy.
we
should
emphasize
the
states
have
the
option
of
participating
in
the
medicaid
program.
so,
arguably
it
was
never
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
medically
needy
get
benefits
automatically.
states
would
have
to
participate
in
the
program
first,
and
then
the
states
would
have
to
opt
to
serve
this
group.
now,
the
medically
needy
consists
of
all
the
individuals
who
would
qualify
for
ssi
or
afdc
except
they
have
sufficient
income
and
resources
to
cover
their
essentials
apart
from
their
medical
expenses.
so,
conceivably,
anyone
can
be
considered
a
potentially
medically
needy
person,
anyone
with
substantial
assets
facing
potentially
substantial
medical
expenses
could
fall
into
this
class
so
long
as
they
are
aged,
blind,
or
disabled.
now,
they
begin
to
receive
medical
assistance
after
they
incur
medical
expenses
which
reduce
their
income
and
assets
below
a
prescribed
level.
so
the
medically
needy
must
incur
medical
expenses
before
they
become
eligible.
that's
a
very
important
difference,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
they
have
sufficient
income
and
resources
or,
arguably,
they
have
sufficient
income
and
resources
which
will
be
applied
toward
their
medical
expenses.
now,
california
has
obviously
chosen
to
participate
in
the
medi-cal
program,
and
as
i
indicated,
the
state
plan
has
been
approved.
and
california
has
opted
to
provide
this
coverage
to
this
medically
needy
group.
many
states
don't
even
get
into
coverage
to
medically
needy
individuals.
as
part
of
its
plan
california
has
adopted
the
transfer
of
assets
rule.
now,
what
is
this
rule?
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
any
transfer
of
assets
for
less
than
adequate
consideration
within
two
years
prior
to
applying
was
made
with
the
intent
to
qualify
for
medical
assistance.
now,
to
rebut
the
presumption,
the
applicant
may
produce
evidence
that
adequate
resources
were
available
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
for
their
support
and
medical
care
considering
such
things
as
the
applicant's
competency
and
life
expectancy
and
health
at
the
time.
if
the
applicant
fails
to
rebut
the
presumption,
then
the
states
can
deny
benefits.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
benefits
are
denied
for
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
value
of
the
asset
would
have
sustained
their
needs
including
their
medical
expenses.
that's
why
mrs.
beltran
ultimately
attained
eligibility.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
exactly.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
it
was
very
interesting.
her
eligibility
was
estimated
as
a
great
period
of
time
but
as
it
turned
out
it
was
only
for
a
couple
of
years.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
mrs.
beltran
had
sufficient
assets
that
could
have
been
used
to
support
her
present
need,
medical
needs.
she
had
them.
however,
she
transferred
her
assets
for
less
than
adequate
consideration
with
the
intent
to
qualify
for
assistance
and
this
transfer
was
made
to
her
children.
now
what's
very
important
here
is
that
she
never
bothered
to
request
a
fair
hearing
to
produce
evidence
to
rebut
the
presumption.
in
fact,
the
facts
here
are
a
bit
confusing.
we
don't
know
what...
arguably
mrs.
beltran
could
have
rebutted
the
presumption
if
she
could
have
shown
at
the
time
that
she
had
sufficient
assets
to
meet
her
present
needs
considering
such
things
as
her
health
and
life
expectancy.
so
she
didn't
even
bother
to
request
a
fair
hearing.
now,
she
was
disqualified
for
medical
assistance
under
the
medically
needy
program.
we
submit
that
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
is
consistent
with
the
medicaid
program.
as
i
indicated,
it's
to
protect
the
public
treasury
and
to
insure
the
benefits
of
aid
to
those
truly
in
need.
now,
it
should
be
noted
here
that
without
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
aged,
blind,
and
disabled
individuals
would
be
able
to
transfer
their
assets
and
not
use
them
to
defray
the
cost
of
their
medical
expenses,
thus
encumbering
the
program
with
substantial
expense.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
nationwide,
aged,
blind,
and
disabled
individuals
become
most
likely
to
require
hospital,
skilled
nursing
and
intermediate
care
facility
services,
which
are
the
most
costly
under
the
program.
individuals
who
in
addition,
elderly
individuals
who
enter
nursing
homes,
may
remain
there
for
a
long
period
of
time
or,
unfortunately,
permanently.
in
new
york,
for
example,
it
is
estimated
that
a
single
month
of
nursing
care
was
as
much
as
$2,000.
per
year.
so
this
is
really
a
very
significant
group
of
benefits
we're
talking
about
here.
now,
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
also
has
another
purpose
that
discourages
the
intentional
divestment
of
assets.
that
is,
it
prevents
individuals
with
substantial
assets
from
transferring
their
property.
now,
the
senate
finance
committee,
interestingly
enough,
noted
that
the
transfer
of
assets
in
good
faith...
you
know,
you
didn't
know
about
medi-cal,
you
didn't
know
about
benefits...
is
really
very
rare.
it's
rare,
and...
as
the
senate
finance
committee
found
out,
also,
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
by
some
courts
has
been
found
to
implement
another
important
policy
procedure
under
the
social
security
act.
that
procedure
is
a
fraud
preventive
measure.
now,
arguably,
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
is
not
in
the
type
of
fraud
that
we
normally
think
of.
however,
an
application
for
medical
assistance
made
after
a
transfer
of
assets
is
a
type
of
misrepresentation
as
to
the
applicant's
available
resources.
on
the
one
hand
he
comes
in
and
he
says
i
don't
have
any
resources;
yet,
before,
he
did.
and
this
misrepresentation
is
made
at
the
expense
of
the
public
treasury.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
yes,
yes.
in
beltran
the
house
was
transferred
to
the
children.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
i
believe--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--there
may
have
been
two
parcels
of
property.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
i
believe
so.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
to
be
quite
candid
with
the
court,
there
was
never
a
fair
hearing
so
these
facts
never
came
out.
those
are
the
facts
that
petitioner
represents
to
us
and
to
the
extent
those
are
true,
that
clearly
is--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--well,
the
first
thing
we
look
at
is
to
determine
whether
or...
we
look
at
the
asset
being
transferred.
not
all
assets...
for
example,
some
assets
are
excluded.
for
example--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--yes.
a
home
is
not,
for
example,
considered
for
purposes
of
establishing
eligibility
under
the
medi-cal
program.
a
car;
certain
income-producing
real
property;
they
are
personal
effects.
all
of
these
types
of
factors
are
not
really
considered.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
essentially,
what
happens
is
an
applicant
goes
into
the
office
and
presents
certain
factors.
now,
in
this
situation,
when
it
was
disclosed
that
in
fact
there
was
a
transfer
of
assets,
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
presumption
arose
and
the
petitioner
had
the
ability
to
request
a
fair
hearing
to
be
able
to
show
that
she
could
rebut
the
presumption.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
yes.
for
example,
if
the
home
is
valued,
say,
at
$20,000
and
it
is
transferred,
then
if
it's
determined
that
that
$20,000
was--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--that
would
be
the
local
welfare
office.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
they
can
request
a
hearing.
normally,
what
happens
is
there's
a
notice
of
action
which
goes
out
saying,
you
are
being
denied
benefits.
then,
that--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--exactly.
in
addition,
the
notice
says,
you
may
request
a
fair
hearing
to
produce
evidence
to
rebut
the
presumption.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
there
was
no
request
here:
yes.
the
transferred
assets--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--you
mean
with
respect
to
the
period
of
eligibility?
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
to
the
extent
that
it's
not
rebutted,
yes,
to
that
extent
the
presumption
would
hold
up
and
then
my
answer
is,
yes.
it
also
should
be
noted
that
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
embodies
a
well-recognized
prohibition
known
to
the
law
for
many
years
against
fraudulent
transfers
to
defraud
creditors.
this
is
known
in
bankruptcy
law
and
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
finally,
turning
to
the
specific
statutes
at
issue
in
this
matter,
it
should
be
emphasized
that
there
is
no
statute
under
title
xix
which
specifically
prohibits
a
transfer
of
assets
rule.
and
it
should
also
be
noted
that
states
have
considerable
flexibility
in
the
administration
of
the
program.
this
is
a
cooperative
federal-state
program
which
gives
the
states
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility
in
considering
various
eligibility
requirements.
now,
turning
now
to
section...
now,
to
repeat
that
long
section
1396a(a)(10)(c)(i),
a
look
at
that
statute,
which
is
the
guiding
principle
here,
there
is
no
statement
about
a
transfer
of
assets.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
can't
impose
a
transfer
of
assets
rule.
in
addition,
the
only...
and
we
look
at
the
other
portions
of
the
statute,
now,
it
may
be
read
as
requiring
that
the
evaluation
of
the
applicant's
income
and
resources
be
determined
by
using
comparable
standards.
so
then
one
wonders,
what
is
comparable
standards?
and
the
9th
circuit
found
that
comparable
standards
by
virtue
of
webster's
is
not
identical
standards.
comparable
standards
are
similar
standards,
and
clearly
california
applies
similar
standards
to
its--
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
--as
i
have
previously
indicated,
there
is
no
statute
under
title
xix
which
specifically
prohibits
a
transfer
of
assets
rule.
a
transfer
of
assets
rule
is,
first
of
all,
consistent
with
42
usc
1396a(a)(10)(c),
and
as
i
indicated,
the
plain
language
of
the
section
does
not
preclude
such
a
rule.
the
first
part
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
medically
needy
group
includes
all
individuals
who
would,
except
for
income
and
resources,
be
eligible
for
ssi.
now
this
section
may
be
read
as
specifically
excluding
income
and
resources
and
it
equates
the
ssi
eligibility
to
the
medically
needy
eligibility
requirement.
now
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
can
clearly
be
construed
as
a
financial
eligibility
requirement
which
pertains
to
the
applicant's
income
and
resources,
and
therefore
clearly
comes
within
the
exception
to
the
first
clause
of
the
statute.
now,
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
the
gist
of
which
provides
that
the
medically
needy
group
includes
all
of
those
individuals
who
have
insufficient
income
and
resources
as
determined
under
comparable
standards
to
pay
for
their
own
medical
care.
now,
this
section
may
be
read
as
requiring
that
the
evaluation
of
the
applicant's
income
and
resources
be
determined
by
using
comparable
standards.
and
as
i
indicated,
comparable
does
not
necessarily
mean
identical;
only
similar.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
well,
the
9th
circuit
found
that
the
comparability
in
this
clause
referred
to...
they
didn't
specifically
say
it,
but
they
read
it
that
it
might
require
comparability
between
the
categorically
needy
and
the
medically
needy.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
legislative
intent
which
suggests
that
comparability
between
these
groups
was
never
intended
by
the
second
part
of
the
statute.
mr.

well,
i
would
submit
that
the
legislative
intent
seems
to
be
clear
in
this
regard.
however,
i
would
give
more
credibility
to
the
9th
circuit's
opinion
in
this
matter.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
i
would
submit
that
there
would
be
comparability
between
the
medically
needy
and
the
categorically
needy.
as
i
said,
there
is
a
conflicting
interpretation
of
those
words.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
yes,
this
reading.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
magasin
no,
i
would
submit
that
this
excepts
our
income
and
resource
standards,
that
they
don't
have
to
be
the
same,
that
you
could
have
a
transfer
of
assets
restriction
and
this
would
be
similar,
but
not
necessarily
identical.
now,
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
is
also
consistent
with
42
usc
section
1396a
(a)(17)(b).
now,
this
section
requires
that
only
available
income
and
resources
considered
in
making
eligibility
determinations
be
considered
under
the
medicaid
program.
now,
when
you
look
at
this
statute,
which
is
also
supposed
to
conflict
with
the
transfer
of
assets
provision,
we
notice
that
there
is
no
plain
preclusion
of
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
in
this
section
either.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
prevents
the
consideration
of
a
transferred
asset
as
available.
in
fact,
the
purpose
of
the
availability
rule
prevents
the
counting
of
assets
of
a
relative
as
available
to
the
applicant.
transfer
of
assets
rule...
this
section
is
not
meant
to
apply
to
a
person
who
manufactures
eligibility
by
giving
away
assets
that
could
be
used
for
medical
expenses.
now,
the
transfer
of
assets
rule
is
also
consistent
with
a
federal
regulation
which
the
petitioners
cite.
this
is
42
cfr,
section
435.401(c).
now
this
section
in
effect
provides
that
states
not
use
requirements
for
determining
eligibility
for
the
medically
needy
which
are
more
restrictive
than
those
used
for
the
categorically
needy.
now,
we
submit
that
this
section
does
not
apply
to
a
financial
eligibility
requirement
such
as
the
transfer
of
assets
rules.
we
base
this
opinion
as
follows.
the
section
was
found
under
the
general
heading
and
title,
"subpart
(e),
general
eligibility
requirements.
"
now
subpart
(e)
does
not
apply
to
financial
eligibility
conditions.
it
applies
to
citizenship,
alienage,
or
state
residents.
now,
further
support
for
this
interpretation
is
found
in
a
prior
wording
of
that
section.
the
prior
wording
specifically
states
that
it
is
meant
to
refer
to
nonfinancial
eligibility
requirements.
now,
it's
very
interesting
to
note
is
that
within
part
435
of
the
cfrs,
subpart
(i)
specifically
covers
financial
eligibility
requirements
for
the
medically
needy.
in
this
section
it
would
be
logical
you
would
see
a
transfer
of
assets
restriction.
there
is
no
such
restriction
in
subpart
(i)
which
specifically
deals
with
income
and
resource
requirements
for
the
medically
needy.
i
would
like
to
also
discuss
the
boren/long
amendment.
now,
it
has
been
argued
that
the
boren/long
amendment
precludes
the
imposition
of
a
transfer
of
assets
rule
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
law.
now,
the
law
itself
was
signed
into
effect
on
december
28,
1980,
and
has
been
designated
public
law
96-611,
section
5.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
it
not
only
permits
transfer
of
assets
rules
in
a
title
xix
program
but
it
also
permits
them
in
a
title
xvi
program,
the
ssi-ssp
programs.
now,
it's
also
very
interesting
to
note
is
that
congress
in
these
provisions
of
the
boren/long
amendment,
these
provisions
are
very
similar
to
california's
transfer
of
assets
restriction.
there
are
some
differences
but
they
are
very
similar.
congress's
intent
in
enacting
this
boren/long
amendment
was
to
correct
an
abusive
practice
whereby
individuals
transfer
substantial
assets
to
relatives
to
qualify
for
medical
assistance.
so
congress
recognized
the
problem
that
california
had
noted
all
along.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
not
every
amendment
of
a
statute
demonstrates
legislative
intent
to
make
a
change
in
the
substance
of
a
preexisting
law.
we
would
submit
that
the
boren/long
amendment
constitutes
an
exclusive
permission
to
the
states
to
impose
a
transfer
of
assets
rule,
and
this
is
further
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
certain
reports
of
the
senate
finance
committee
suggest
that
the
amendment
was
the
result
of
congressional
desire
to
remedy
the
effect
of
erroneous
court
decisions
striking
down
the
rule,
so
apparently
congress
was
aware
at
this
time
of
these
decisions
perhaps
in
the
2nd
and
4th
circuits
striking
down
the
rule
and
said,
we
don't
want
to
give
credibility
to
those
decisions,
we
are
enacting
this
provision,
and
we
want
to
make
sure
that
it
is
not
intended
to
show
that
we
agree
with
those
decisions
striking
down
the
rule.
based
on
the
foregoing,
the
9th
circuit
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
this
concludes
our
presentation.
