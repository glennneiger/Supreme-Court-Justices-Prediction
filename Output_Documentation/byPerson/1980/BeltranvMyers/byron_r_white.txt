it
may
be
official
but
doesn't
the
state
have
to
submit
a
plan?
justice
white
and
doesn't
it,
before
it
gets
federal
funds,
it
has
to
have
it
approved?

and

no

a
letter
like

usually,

the
outcome
of

letter
doesn't
constitute
a
determination
of
noncompliance,

it?
justice

are
civil
cases
tried
that
fast?
justice

three
months
isn't
the
rule,
isn't
it?
