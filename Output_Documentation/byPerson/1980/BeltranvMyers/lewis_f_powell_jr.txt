justice
jr.
mr.
deford,
before
you
commence,
may
i
ask
what
relief
you
now
think
would
be
appropriate
in
light
of
the
amendment
to
the
statute?
justice
jr.
would
you
have
any
problem
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
jr.
you
also
requested
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
would
either
of
those
give
you
anything
that...
in
light
of
the
statutory
change?
justice
jr.
so
your
principal
reliance
would
be
on
reimbursement.
