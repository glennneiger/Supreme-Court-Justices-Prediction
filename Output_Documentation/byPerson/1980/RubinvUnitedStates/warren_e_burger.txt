we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
william
rubin
v.
united
states,
79-1013.
mr.
bender,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
foreclosed
on
a
default
it
would
be
an
investor,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
the
transaction
was
initiated,
it
had
to
contemplate
the
risks,
the
investor-type
risks;
does
not
every
bank
do
that
with
respect
to
collateral?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
bank
was
induced
to
part
with
some
of
its
funds,
conditionally
of
course,
but
to
part
with
some
of
its
funds
in
reliance
upon
what
was
tendered
to
them,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
it
was
interested
in
getting
it's
capital
back.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
burger
well
if
we
have
a
literal
statutory
construction
available,
why
do
we
look
at
legislative
history?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
ruben
against
the
united
states,

for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed

the

of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice

filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
