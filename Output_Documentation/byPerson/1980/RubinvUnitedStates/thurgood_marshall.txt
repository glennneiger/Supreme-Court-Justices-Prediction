who
owned
the
securities?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
worried
about
the
fact
that
if
i
own
something
i
can
spend
it,
and
the
owners
of
these
securities
couldn't
spend
them,
could
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know,
they
were
simply
pledged?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
were
pledged,
weren't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
couldn't
be
sold
by
the
owner,
could
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
problems,
i
know
the
technicalities
of
the
stocks,
but
the
fact
that
he
says
mr.
bank,
i
want
to
sell
you
$50,000
worth
of
stock,
and
says
mr.
bank,
i
want
the
$50,000
and
i'll
let
you
hold
this
stock.
that
seems
so
close
to
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
the
same
stock.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
talking
about
fraud,
now.
justice
marshall
you're
not
talking
about,
you
know,
niceties.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
have
great
difficulty
upholding,
sanctioning
and
permitting
to
continue,
frauds.
i
have
great
difficulty
doing
that.
