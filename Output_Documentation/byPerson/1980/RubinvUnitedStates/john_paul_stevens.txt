question:
mr.
bender,
that
doesn't
estop
the
solicitor
general
from
doing
further
research,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
suppose
this
issue
will
only
come
up
in
criminal
cases?
because
in
a
civil
case,
if
you've
got
a
loan
secured
by
stock
you've
got
your
liability
established
by
the
note.
so
there's
really
no
reason
to
fuss
about
it
in
a
civil
case,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
that
you've
been
interrupted,
mr.
shapiro,
how
do
you
respond
to
mr.
bender's
argument
that
it
took
the
sec
a
long
time
to
realize
that
this
language
covered
a
pledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
is
that
argument
really
critical
to
your
position?
i
was
wondering,
supposing
you
had...
here
you
say,
there
was
fraud
that
misrepresented
the
value
of
the
securities,
the
ownership
and
the
fictitious
quotations
and
all
the
rest.
but
supposing
you
had
a
loan
in
which
the
borrower
gave
the
bank
a
fraudulent
balance
sheet
and
pledged
general
motors
stock
that
was
in
fact
worth...
listed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
worth
precisely
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
worth,
would
that
violate
the
securities
act
under
your
view
of
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
security,
it
would
be
a
fraud
in
connection
with
the
pledge
of
the
stock,
it's
all
one
ball
of
wax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you're
right,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
there
have
to
be
a
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
something
such
as
the
value
or
nature
or
ownership
of
the
security
itself,
as
part
of
the
government's
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
are
in
1975?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
surely
wouldn't
contend
that
the
'33
and
'34
acts
were
primarily
directed
at
the
mafia,
would
you?
