mr.
louis
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court:
the
question
before
this
court
is
a
single
point,
referred
to
in
point
1
of
petitioner's
brief,
and
that
is
whether
the
pledge
of
securities
as
collateral
for
a
loan
is
a
sale
or
a
purchase
for
the
purpose
of
invoking
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
acts.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
pledge
is
not
a
sale
or
purchase
under
either
the
1933
definition
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
act,
or
under
section
10(b)
and
rule
10b-5
of
the
1934
act.
the
pledge
occurred
in
this
case
as
the
result
of
series
of
loans
totaling
approximately
$475,000,
by
tri-state
energy,
a
corporation,
by
whom
petitioner
was
employed
from
october
19th,
1972,
through
december
6th,
1972.
that
is
to
say,
the
loans
were
obtained
over
that
period,
october
19th,
1972,
through
december
the
6th,
1972.
the
loans
were
evidenced
by
promissory
notes
that
were
executed
by
the
borrower
corporation
and
were
individually
guaranteed
by
some
of
the
officers,
including
the
petitioner
who
was
not
a
stockholder
of
the
corporation.
side
collateral
was
given
for
the
loan.
and
at
page
8
of
petitioner's
brief,
the
principal
witness
for
the
government,
an
employee
of
the
bank,
describes
his
definition
of
side
collateral
to
be:
that
when
the
loan
was
made
initially
the
loan
was
envisioned
that
it
would
be
repaid
from
the
ongoing
operations
of
the
corporation,
namely
from
the
sale
of
coal
or
natural
gas,
the
collateral
was
taken
as
a
secondary
source
of
repayment
in
the
event
that
the
primary
source,
the
ongoing
operations
of
the
corporation
didn't
materialize.
also
given
by
the
borrowers
at
the
time
were
blank
stock
powers,
corporate
resolutions
authorizing
the
pledging
and
hypothecation
of
securities
of
the
stock
as
security
for
the
loan.
the
loan
was
defaulted,
and
i
don't
think
it's
disputed
here
that
the
bank
sued
the
petitioner
in
the
state
court,
in
new
york,
on
the
promissory
note
based
upon
his
individual
guaranty.
the
evidence
of
the
lawsuit
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
at
174(a),
which
is
an
affidavit
of
confession
of
judgment.
it
is
undisputed
that
there
was
no
foreclosure
of
the
securities
by
the
bank,
so
that
actually
this
court
does
not
really
have
to
reach
any
interest
in
what
may
have
occurred,
or
interest
in
the
securities
as
to
what
may
occur
if
there
was
a
foreclosure.
to
that
extent,
the
fifth
and
the
seventh
circuit
courts
which
support
petitioner's
position
here,
and
goes
that
far,
we
submit,
is
unnecessary
for
this
court's
decision
any
more
than
the
second
circuit
court's
decision
in
mallis,
bankers
trust
company
against
mallis,
which
considers
the
release
of
the
security
by
the
bank
or
the
pledgee
as
being
a
sale
within
the
anti-fraud
provisions,
is
likewise
unnecessary
to
reach
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
charge
is
set
forth,
that
is,
the
indictment
in
this
case,
is
set
forth
in
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief.
this
was
a
conspiracy
plus
two
substantive
counts,
counts
i,
ii,
and
iii.
the
conspiracy
encompassed
a
charge
of
violating
three
objects:
the
only
one
that
we're
concerned
with
is
the
one
which
charged
a
violation
of
section
17(a)(1)
in
the
offer
and
sale
of
a
security,
pursuant
to
a
scheme
to
defraud.
and
that
was
under
section
77x
of
the
1933
securities
act.
i
should
add
that
petitioner
was
acquitted
of
the
substantive
charge
in
count
iii,
which
was
a
violation
of
section
17(a)(1)
of
the
1933
act.
he
was
convicted
of
the
conspiracy
which
encompassed
the
three
objects.
with
respect
to
the
second
count
which
was
a
substantive
count,
also
one
of
the
objects
of
the
conspiracy,
to
defraud
the
bank
of
the
half
million
dollars
in
violation
of
section
1014
of
title
18,
the
jury
had...
and
incidentally,
which
subsumed
all
of
the
alleged
fraud
in
the
pledging
of
the
securities
in
count
i,
and
that
appears
at
page
28
of
our
brief
footnote
in
the
statement
of
the
prosecutor,
the
jury
did
not
reach
a
verdict
on
count
ii.
but
the
prosecutor,
after
the
jury
had
convicted
of
conspiracy,
agreed
to
concede
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
petitioner
does
not
mount
any
challenge
to
the
fraud
alleged
in
this
case,
and
of
course,
that's
prominently
brought
out
by
my
learned
brother;
but
the
fact
is
that
since
the
issue,
we
feel,
is
one
of
law,
we
assume
the
fraud
for
that
purpose.
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
we
concede
the
fraud.
petitioner
contends
that
no
matter
how
the
fraud
alleged
in
the
pledge
of
the
collateral,
the
pledge
transaction
did
not
constitute
a
sale
under
section
17(a)(1)
of
the
1933
act
or
section
10b
or
rule
10b-5
of
the
1934
act,
and
that
therefore,
the
conviction
must
be
reversed.
now
we
take
this
position
because
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
with
which
we
agree,
we
believe
that
if
we
were
to,
as
the
government
argues,
or
my
learned
brother
argues,
extend
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
1933
act
to
a
pledge,
an
ordinary,
garden
variety
pledge
of
stock
as
collateral
for
a
loan
to
the
terms
sale
in
the
1933
act
or
purchase
in
the
1934
act,
it
would
add
a
gloss
to
the
operative
language
of
the
statute
which,
we
submit,
was
not
intended
by
congress
in
view
of
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
of
those
words,
sale
and
purchase.
mr.
louis
bender
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
personally
do
not.
i
do
say,
however,
that
the
courts
of
appeal
in
the
fifth
and
the
seventh
circuits
do
say
that
the
language
is
broad
enough
in
the
sense
that
it
includes
a
disposition
of
an
interest
in
the
security
as
being
broad
enough
to
include
a
pledge.
and
the
reason
why
i
don't,
frankly,
think
so,
is
because
i
think
that
what
a
pledger
does
in...
and
what
he
did
in
this
case...
is
simply
to
buy
credit.
he
doesn't
sell
anything.
and
then
the
motion--
mr.
louis
bender
--the
word
disposition,
under
the
webster's
dictionary,
is
such
a
broad
thing,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
even
includes
a
donation,
a
giving.
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
you
could
say
that
the
realities
of
the
transaction
is
that
a
pledger
says
to
a
bank,
i'm
going
to
borrow
half
a
million
dollars
from
you
and
i'm
going
to
put
up
security,
i'm
going
to
give
you
an
agreement.
and
that
agreement
is
that
in
the
event
i
default
on
this
loan,
you
have
an
interest
in
my
collateral.
so
that
actually
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
most
a
pledger
does
is
give
an
agreement
that
if
there's
a
default
the
bank
will
acquire
an
interest.
but
there
is
not
an
effective
in
present
disposition
of
an
interest
at
the
time
the
collateral
agreement
is
entered
into.
in
any
event,
even
if
we
were
to
assume
as
my
learned
brother
stresses
that
the
literal
definition
of
the
statute,
clearly
embraces
a
pledge,
it
must
be
apparent
that
if
congress
intended
to
include
a
pledge
in
the
definition,
it
would
have
said
so.
it
did
so,
but
a
year
later,
in
1935;
that
is
two
years
later,
in
the
public
utility
holding
act,
which
i
will
come
to--
mr.
louis
bender
--my
learned
brother
also
finds
in
the
legislative
history,
a
very
distinct
congressional
intention
to
include
a
pledge
in
the
definition.
i
must
confess
that
the
courts
below,
that
are
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
seventh,
find
no
such
clear
legislative
history.
i
must
confess
further
that
the
legislative
history
as
set
forth
is
rather
suspect.
and
the
reason
why
i
say
that
is
because
on
november
10th,
1977,
right
before
this
court,
in
the
bankers
trust
company
against
mallis
argument,
that's
number
76-1359
at
page
45
of
the
transcript,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
powell
who
asked
the
question,
"is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
either
act
of
1933
or
1934
that
supports
your
position
that
a
pledge
is
a
sale?
"
mr.
pitt,
who
has
been
identified
as
general
counsel
of
the
sec,
"if
there
is
anything
or
something
specific
on
pledges,
i
must
confess
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
"
secondly--
mr.
louis
bender
no,
it...
it
does
not,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
if
that
was
the
only
area
in
which
there
might
have
been
a
difference,
i
would
be
hard
put
to
say
the
legislative
history
is
suspect.
but
i
have
an
even
more
significant
fact,
and
that
is
that
the
sec
conceded
before
this
very
court
on
the
same
argument,
that
it
had
never
taken
a
position
that
the
securities
act
of
1933
or
1934
embraced
in
its
definition
a
congressional
intent
to
include
pledges.
mr.
louis
bender
well,
except
that
the,
in
the
government's
position...
i
mean,
since
these
cases
all
come
up,
for
example,
gentile,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
on
a
criminal
case.
but
all
the
other
cases
are
civil
cases.
mr.
louis
bender
there
are
civil
cases
under
17(a)(1),
and
civil
cases
where,
under
10(b)(5).
and
for
example,
the...
i
believe,
so
that
actually,
to
answer
your
question,
although
the
government,
or
my
learned
brother
would
like
to
separate
this
issue
by
saying
that
this
is
a
criminal
case
it
should
not
and
will
not
affect
what
may
happen
as
far
as
civil
actions
are
concerned.
the
fact
remains
that
the
securities
exchange
commission's
general
counsel
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
indicate
that
the
same
rule
that
would
apply
in
the
criminal
case,
at
least
with
respect
to
whether
a
pledge
of
collateral
for
a
loan
is
a
sale,
would
apply
in
any
civil
action.
and
the
courts
seem
generally
to
take
that
position.
and
of
course,
the
general
counsel
of
the
sec
told
this
court
the
last
time
that
you
also
can't
separate
the
1933
act
definitions
from
the
1934,
even
though
there's
a
slight
difference
in
the
wording.
because
the
statutes
are
entire
materia,
they
said,
so
that
what
you
hold
with
regard
to
the
definition
of
a
sale
under
the
1933
act
applies
under
the
1934
act.
when
congress
wanted
to
say
that
a
pledge
was
a
sale,
it
had
no
trouble
saying
so;
and
it
did
so
in
the
public
utility
holding
act.
mr.
louis
bender
it
is...
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
louis
bender
yes,
you're
absolutely
right.
it
was
a
year
after
the
1934
act.
but
the
point
is,
that
if,
as
the
government
argues,
the
1933
congress
that
passed
the
securities
act
of
1933
had
before
it
a
1929
definition
of
the
uniform
sales
of
securities
act,
and
presumably
adopted
that
definition
which
included
a
pledge,
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
congress,
passing
the
public
utility
holding
act
in
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
the
administrative
agency
enforcing
that
act
and
certainly
didn't
have
before
it
the
1933
and
1934
definitions
of
sale,
and
yet
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
include
a
pledge
as
a
sale--
mr.
louis
bender
--well
as
i
said
before,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
fifth
and
the
seventh
circuits
seem
to
agree
that
it's
broad
enough.
that
the
language
itself
is
broad
enough
to
include
a
pledge.
what
i...
what
they
say,
however,
is
that
the
economic
underlying
realities
of
a
pledge
indicate
that
it's
so
far
from
what
a
sale
or
a
purchase
really
was
intended
by
congress,
that
the
literal
interpretation
should
not
be
followed
in
the
sense
of
reality.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
set
forth
in
the
totally
different
kind
of
rights
that
exist
as
between
a
pledge
and
as
between
an
actual
sale.
and
the
fact
remains
that
for
25
years,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
the
administrative
agency
who
sat
with
the
congress
at
the
time
that
this
act
was
enacted,
never
took
a
public
position
that
a
pledge
was
included.
it
was
only
until
the
late
1950's
that
they
conceded
that
they
did;
and
it's
interesting,
because
professor
loss
points
out
that
it
was
only
when
the
guild
films
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
on
which
the
second
circuit's
gentile
decision
relies
came
down
did
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
adopt
the
decision
to
its
corporate
bosom
and
take
the
position
that
a
pledge
was
included
as
a
sale.
now
my
learned
brother
makes
no
mention
in
his
brief
as
to
why,
if
the
legislative
history
intended
to
include
a
pledge
even
though
it
didn't
say
so,
why
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
never
took
that
position
publicly.
and
this
court
had
occasion
to
remark
about
the
divergent
views
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
the
international
brotherhood
case,
dealing
with
the
includability
of
the
noncontributory
pension.
i
believe
mr.
justice
powell,
speaking
for
the
court,
said
"when
the
instant
litigation
arose,
the
public
record
reveals
no
evidence
that
the
sec
had
ever
considered
the
securities
acts
applicable
to
a
non-contributory
pension.
"
similarly
here,
the
sec
never
took
the
position
that
pledges
were
included
in
the
act.
and
as
i
say,
the
public
utility
holding
act,
in
1935,
clearly
includes
pledge
in
its
definition
of
a
sale.
now
my
learned
brother
says
that
we
shouldn't
look
to
what
congress
did
in
1935
to
determine
what
it
did
or
intended
to
do
in
1933.
this
court,
we
submit,
had
no
trouble
in
doing
just
that
very
thing,
even
where
a
greater
span
existed
between
the
1933
and
1934
acts
in
the
international
brotherhood
case
against
daniel.
now
my
learned
brother
says
that
congress
intended
to
protect
banks,
corporate
businesses,
lenders...
even
if
the
bank
was
not
an
investor
in
this
particular
instance
and
of
course
the
bank,
really,
if
you
look
at
the
underlying
transactions,
was
not
an
investor.
mr.
louis
bender
it
might
very
well,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
as
i
say,
that
is
an
issue
that
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach.
mr.
louis
bender
it
certainly
does.
and
i
think
that
they
would
be
foolish
not
to.
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
when
they
entered
into
the
transaction
and
they
simply
got
a
contract
right
to
acquire
an
interest,
that
that...
any
fraud
involved
in
that
kind
of
a
pledge
would
constitute
a
sale.
the
issue
we
have
here
is
there
was
no
foreclosure.
and
what
we're
dealing
with
is
an
ordinary
garden
variety
pledge
at
the
moment
of
the
pledge,
not
what
might
happen
when
there's
a
foreclosure.
mr.
louis
bender
that,
i
believe,
is...
would
be
normally
so
in
the
ordinary
pledge
case.
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
normally
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
here,
the
loan,
the
first
part
of
the
loan
at
least
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
prior
to
the
fact
that
any
security
was
put
up...
although,
there
was
an
agreement
that
collateral
security
would
be
supplied.
but
the
primary
purpose
was
not
for
the
bank
to
require
an
interest
in
the
securities;
the
primary
purpose
was
for
the
bank
to
make
a
loan
and
get
paid.
and
this
was
the
intention
of
the
bank,
this
was
the
intention
as
far
as
the
pledge
agreement
is
concerned.
and
it
seems
to
me,
we
submit,
that
in
determining
whether
you
have
a
sale
or
a
disposition
of
an
interest,
and
congress
intended
a
pledge
to
be
covered,
you've
got
to
look
at
what
the
realities
of
the
situation
was.
now
we
raised,
petitioner
raised
the
fact
that
the
bank
was
not
interested
at
the
time
of
the
pledge
in
obtaining
any
profits
on
the
securities,
the
bank
was
not
interested
in
making
anything
more
on
its
loan
than
interest,
which
it
was
to
get.
and
the
government--
mr.
louis
bender
--well
of
course,
i
mean
plus
its
capital.
but
it
was
not
interested
in
trading
on
the
securities,
mr.
chief
justice.
or
at
least
making
any
money
on
the
sale
of
a
security
at
the
time
that
it
was
entering
into
the
loan
transaction.
it
was
solely
interested
in
making
a
loan,
getting
its
interest,
and
then
in
getting
a
repayment
of
the
loan
at
the
time.
mr.
louis
bender
if
the
government
relies...
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
the
government
relies
substantially
upon
that,
i
think
this
case
is
totally
inapposite.
in
that
case,
you
had
a
clear
appearance
of
a
sale;
there,
the
defendant
calls
up
his
broker
and
says
i
want
you
to
sell
short
securities.
the
broker
sells
short
the
securities
at
a
time
when
the
defendant
didn't
own
the
securities.
so
that
you
actually
have,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
quite
properly
pointed
out,
an
absolute
sale
that
occurred.
either
you
had
a
sale,
an
offer
and
a
sale
at
the
time
the
sale
was
requested,
or
you
certainly
had
an
attempt
to
sale
when
the
securities
were
disposed
of.
and
this
was
a
part
of
the
entire
selling
process.
this
is
totally
unlike
what
we
have
here.
if
you
had
any
fraud
here
at
all,
the
fraud,
which
is
essential,
occurred
in
the
obtaining
of
the
credit.
and
that
was
not
the
fraud
in
connection
with
the
offer
and
sale
of
a
security.
now,
the
government,
i
mean
my
learned
brother--
mr.
louis
bender
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
louis
bender
the--
mr.
louis
bender
--some
of
these
securities
were
rented?
mr.
louis
bender
no,
no.
no,
according
to
the
record,
mr.
justice
marshall,
there's
no
question,
some
of
them
were
rented.
mr.
louis
bender
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
louis
bender
well
there
is,
there's
contradictory
evidence
to
that
extent.
there
is
an
agreement
by
the
rental
to
the
corporation
which
permits
the
bank
to
dispose
of
it
just
as
if
the
borrower
owned
the
stock.
and
it's
a
perfectly
legitimate
transaction.
but
it
seems
to
me
that,
i
have
to
stand
on
the
assumption
and
i
am
doing
that
here--
mr.
louis
bender
--well--
mr.
louis
bender
--well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
know,
if--
mr.
louis
bender
--yes,
if
congress--
mr.
louis
bender
--yes,
that's
true.
congress
however,
did
not
intend
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
or
the
securities
acts
to
be
the
panacea
for
penalizing
all
the
frauds
that
existed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
case,
we
are
confronted
with
the--
mr.
louis
bender
--well
i
don't
disagree
with
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
but
i
do
say
that
there's
sufficient
other
statutory,
federal
and
state
law
to
protect
any
individual
who
is
victimized
by
fraud.
we
have
a
very
narrow
technical
question:
whether
or
not
the
securities
law
was
intended
to
punish
anyone
for
committing
a
fraud
under
these
circumstances
if
it
was
not
technically
an
offer
and
sale,
then
there
are
other
provisions,
just
like
1014
of
title
18
there
are
state
court
provisions.
the
government
indicates
that
there
was
evidence
before
the
congress
in
1975
that
were...
that
it
appeared
that
organized
crime
and
mafia
were
utilizing
pledges
to...
may
i
just
conclude...
to
obtain
monies
on
securities.
well
it's,
i
mean,
it's
incredible
that
congress
would
say
that
sec
enforcement
personnel
would
go
out
and
mount
a
challenge
to
mafia
on
the
pledges.
certainly
there
are
other
law
enforcement
agencies
that
are
quite
capable
of
doing
this.
mr.
louis
bender
that
is
correct;
that
is
quite
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
and
in
that
case,
even
though
as
you
point
out,
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
that
because
one
of
the
frauds
involved
is...
one
of
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
act,
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
extend
the
operative
language
beyond
what
congress
intended.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
