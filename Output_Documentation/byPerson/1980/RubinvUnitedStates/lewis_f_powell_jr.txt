justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
interrupt
you
a
minute?
the
evils
that
brought
about
the
enactment
of
the
act
of
'33
related
primarily
to
the
stock
markets
of
the
united
states.
what
evils
did
congress
intend
to
protect
banks,
like
bankers
trust
company,
from,
when
it
enacted
the
act
of
1933?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
the
great
banks
of
our
country
the
members
of
the
public
who
congress
intended
to
protect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
there
any
evidence
that
the
bank
needed
this
protection?
the
bank
makes
loans
primarily
on
other
considerations.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
yet
the
language
of
10(b)
is
quite
different
from
the
language
of
this
act
of
'33;
it's
not
as
broad?
