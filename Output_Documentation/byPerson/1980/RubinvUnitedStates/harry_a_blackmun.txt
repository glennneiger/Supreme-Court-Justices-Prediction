well
mr.
bender,
do
you
concede,
however,
that
the
literal
language
of
the
definition
of
sale
in
the
'33
act
is
broad
enough
to
embrace
a
pledge
transaction?
justice
blackmun
which
is
the...
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
rest,
pivot
his
case
more
on
the
word
sale
than
on
the
word
dispose.
i'll
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
his
willingness
to
do
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bender,
this
investor
approach
is
somewhat
impinged
upon
by
the
court's
decision
in
the
united
states
against
naftalin,
isn't
it?
and
i
notice
you
don't
cite
that,
although
the
government
in
its
brief,
seems
to
give
a
lot
of
attention
to
it.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bender,
certainly
under
the
recent
aaron
case,
the
court
drew
almost
precisely
the
distinction
to
which
you
just
made
reference,
is
that
not
so?
