what
does
the
word
disposition
include
other
than
sale,
if
you're
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
different
congress
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
different
congress,
so
one
was
1933
and
one
was
1935.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
in
the
'33
act
definition,
where
it's
defining
sale,
it
says
it
"shall
include
every
contract
of
sale.
"
so
i
suppose
that
goes
further
than
an
actual
physical
delivery,
right
there,
when
you're
talking
about
a
contract
of
sale,
would
include
an
agreement
to
transfer
possession
in
60
days
or
disposition...
now
that,
wouldn't
that
include
any
agreement
to
transfer
by
pledge,
if
disposition
is
such
a
broad
gauge
term,
as
you
have
suggested?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
don't
mean
that
there
were
no
instances
of
the
fraudulent
pledges
between
1933
and
1958?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
take
that
argument
seriously?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
even
if
they
were
of
no
importance
to
the
federal
government,
if
congress
is
exercising
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
has
made
it
a
crime,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
story?
