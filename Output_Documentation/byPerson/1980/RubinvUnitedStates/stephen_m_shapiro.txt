mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
contends
that
section
17(a)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
prohibits
fraudulent
pledges
of
securities.
in
making
this
contention,
we
rely
on
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
those
terms
in
1933
and
the
legislative
history.
i'd
like
to
take
up
each
of
these
points
in
turn
with
a
concluding
reference
to
petitioner's
policy
arguments.
section
17(a)
forbids
fraudulent
or
deceptive
practices
of
any
kind
in
the
offer
or
sale
of
securities.
petitioner
doesn't
deny
that
he
and
his
co-conspirators
pledged
securities
with
the
bank
or
that
they
deliberately
made
misrepresentations
about
the
value,
marketability
and
ownership
of
those
securities.
instead
he
contends
that
pledge
transactions
should
not
be
deemed
to
be
offers
or
sales
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
in
our
submission
the
literal
terms
of
the
securities
act
leave
no
room
to
doubt
that
the
petitioner
both
offered
and
sold
securities.
under
the
statute,
the
word
sale
is
not
limited
to
a
common
law
sale
in
which
title
or
fee
simple
ownership
is
transferred.
it
expressly
includes
every,
and
i
emphasize
the
word
every,
disposition
of
an
interest
in
a
security
for
value.
the
word
offer
is
defined
by
congress
in
equally
expansive
terms.
the
word
offer
includes
every
attempt
to
dispose
of
an
interest
in
a
security
for
value.
petitioner
and
his
co-conspirators
offered
and
sold
securities
because
they
attempted
to
and
did
convey
a
legal
interest
in
those
securities
to
the
bank-pledgee.
the
bank
stipulated
that
it
would
not
part
with
its
money
without
obtaining
that
legal
interest.
the
interest
of
course
was
the
pledgee's
legal
right
to
possess
the
securities
and
to
sell
them
in
the
event
of
a
default
for
its
own
benefit.
that
legal
interest
which
petitioner
correctly
describes
in
his
brief
as
a
security
interest
was
formalized
by
stock
powers
and
powers
of
attorney
which
gave
the
bank
the
right
to
sell
those
securities
if
necessary
to
satisfy
its
economic
claim.
if
congress
had
meant
to
exclude
this
well-recognized
legal
interest
of
a
pledgee
from
the
definition
of
offer
and
sale,
it
surely
would
not
have
used
the
language
that
it
did
in
the
securities
act.
it
would
be
a
remarkable
example
of
legislative
inattention
if
congress
wrote
this
statute
to
extend
to
every
disposition
of
an
interest
in
a
security.
if
it
really
had
meant
to
say
every
disposition
of
an
interest
except
for
a
pledge.
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
interest,
which
congress
used
without
qualification,
is
the
legally
enforceable
right
to
have
an
advantage
accruing
from
some
thing,
or
any
right
in
the
nature
of
property
but
less
than
title.
it
was
settled
law
in
1933
that
a
pledgee
obtained
just
such
a
legal
right.
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
learned
treatises
of
the
time,
confirmed
that
a
pledgee
received
a
special
property
interest
in
pledged
securities
and
that
it
gave
value
for
that
special
property
interest
when
it
extended
credit.
indeed,
by
1933,
it
was
a
black
letter
principle
of
commercial
law
that
a
pledgee
that
received
negotiable
securities
without
notice
of
adverse
claims,
enjoyed
the
status
of
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value,
whose
legal
interest
was
superior
to
that
of
third
parties,
claiming
prior
ownership
rights.
in
short,
looking
to
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
terms
used
by
congress
when
the
securities
act
was
enacted,
it's
clear
that
the
petitioner's
pledge
of
securities
was
a
disposition
of
an
interest
in
those
securities
for
value.
i
might
add
in
this
connection
that
although
mr.
bender
has
addressed
the
question
in
this
case
with
great
competence,
i
have
yet
to
hear
him
explain
to
the
court
what
it
was
that
the
bank
got,
if
it
wasn't
a
legal
interest
in
these
pledged
securities.
petitioner
of
course
also
argues
that
the
court
should
not
apply
the
statute
literally,
as
congress
has
written
it,
because
the
legislative
history
doesn't
refer
to
pledge
transactions.
that
omission
however,
is
not
sufficing,
because
the
legislative
history
doesn't
describe
any
of
the
interests
that
congress
meant
to
embrace
within
its
definition
of
offer
and
sale.
congress
took
care
of
the
problem
of
specifying
which
transactions
it
meant
to
cover,
by
drafting
the
statute
to
apply
to
every
disposition
of
an
interest
in
a
security.
and
even
more
fundamentally,
omissions
from
the
legislative
history
can't
nullify
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
as
this
court
pointed
out,
last
term,
in
harrison
v.
p.p.g.
industries,
where
the
court
stated
and
i
quote,
"it
would
be
a
strange
cannon
of
statutory
construction
that
would
require
congress
to
state
in
committee
reports
or
elsewhere,
that
which
is
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
"
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
from
these
remarks
that
the
legislative
history
doesn't
shed
light
on
the
issue
in
this
case.
it
does
shed
substantial
light
and
confirms
the
appropriateness
of
the
literal
statutory
construction.
in
the
first
place--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
completely
unnecessary,
your
honor,
if...
unless
the
legislative
history
were
to
completely
conflict
with
the
plain
meaning,
the
legislative
history
is
merely
icing
on
the
cake.
and
we
offer
it
in
that
spirit,
because
the
literal
terms
of
this
statute
do
prohibit
fraud
in
the
pledge
of
securities.
but
just
to
assure
the
court
that
there
is
no
disharmony
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
plain
text,
i'll
refer
briefly
to
the
antecedents
of
the
statute.
this
history
shows
that
congress
intended
its
definitions
of
offer
and
sale
to
be
broad
and
expansive
definitions,
as
this
court
recently
emphasized
in
united
states
against
naftalin.
for
this
reason,
the
statutory
definitions
which
reach
every
disposition
or
attempt
to
dispose
of
an
interest
in
a
security
for
value,
should
not
be
given
an
interpretation
which
narrows
the
broad
language
deliberately
selected
by
congress.
in
the
second
place,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
based
its
definitional
language
on
the
language
used
in
the
uniform
sale
of
securities
act
of
1929.
the
literal
terms
of
that
uniform
act
apply
to
pledge
transactions
and
the
language
was
so
construed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
one
year
before
congress
incorporated
that
language.
this
re-inforces
the
ordinary
presumption
that
congress
intended
that
the
language
that
it
used
would
be
given
a
literal
statutory
construction.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
evil
is
fraud
and
the
disposition
of
an
interest
in
a
security
for
value--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
believe
that
they
clearly
were.
we
refer
to
the
preamble
of
the
securities
act
of
'34,
a
companion
piece
of
legislation--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
as
i
hope...
i
hope
to
take
this
point
up
at
some
length,
in
the
preamble
to
the
'34
act,
congress
pointed
out
the
deceptive
and
manipulative
practices
affecting
securities
interfered
with
bank
evaluation
of
collateral
pledged
for
loans.
that
was
specifically
addressed
by
congress
only
one
year
after
the
enactment
of
the
'33
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
agree
that
the
definitional
language
in
the
two
statutes
can
be
distinguished,
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
but
i
was
merely
responding
on
the
level
of
the
evils
that
congress
was
concerned
with
during
this
era.
and
congress
did
identify
this
very
evil
in
1934.
because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
would
respond
by
saying
that
the
first
time
that
it
came
up
which
was
1958,
the
sec
filed
an
action
to
restrain
the
fraudulent
pledges
and
it
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit,
that
was
the
first
occasion
that
it
arose
and
the
commission
has
taken
that
position
ever
since.
so
there
is
no
hiatus
in
the
commission's
interpretation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
were
none
that
were...
that
i'm
aware
of
that
were
brought
to
the
commission's
attention.
certainly
the
commission
never
interpreted
the
statute
differently
than
it
is
now
interpreting
it;
it's
been
a
consistent
interpretation
ever
since
this
issue
first
came
up
in
litigation
in
'58.
because
the
language
that
congress
has
used
is
unambiguous
and
is
not
at
odds
with
the
legislative
history,
it's
unnecessary
to
dwell
at
any
length
on
the
contentions
of
policy
or
statutory
purpose
that
petitioner
has
presented
in
his
brief.
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
those
contentions
are
supportive
of
his
position.
to
the
extent
that
policy
is
relevant
here,
it
supports
the
government's
interpretation.
petitioner,
of
course,
argues
that
section
17(a)
should
protect
investors
only,
and
not
defrauded
banks.
that's
the
very
line
of
argument
that
this
court
rejected
in
united
states
against
naftalin.
in
naftalin,
the
defendant
defrauded
several
brokerage
houses
which
served
as
financial
intermediaries;
they
weren't
investors,
they
didn't
purchase
securities.
this
court,
nonetheless,
applied
the
statute
literally,
concluding
that
it
forbids
all
fraudulent
devices
and
transactions
that
meet
the
statutory
definition
of
offer
or
sale,
regardless
of
the
identity
of
the
victim.
the
statute
protects
honest
businesses,
as
well
as
investors,
as
this
court
held
unequivocally
in
naftalin.
petitioner
also
argues
that
the
bank
here
assumed
a
commercial
risk
rather
than
an
investment
risk,
and
therefore
his
fraud
should
be
immune
to
punishment.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
suggests
that
the
nature
of
the
risk
assumed
by
the
victim
of
the
fraud
has
any
relevance.
i
need
hardly
point
out,
moreover,
that
congress
has
not
defined
these
terms
investment
risk
and
commercial
risk,
which
petitioner
relies
on.
it
would
therefore
be
most
inappropriate
to
construe
a
criminal
statute
such
as
section
17(a)
by
reference
to
these
undefined
concepts.
congress
has
drafted
the
statute
without
ambiguities,
to
apply
to
every
disposition
of
an
interest
in
a
security
for
value.
it
makes
no
difference
that
that
disposition
occurs
in
a
commercial
or
a
business
environment,
or
that
involves
a
risk
that
might
be
characterized
as
having
commercial
attributes.
i
should
point
out,
also,
in
this
connection
that
although
petitioner
asks
the
court
to
look
to
the
economic
realities
of
the
transactions
in
which
he
engaged,
the
reality
of
those
transactions
was
that
the
bank
gave
value
and
acquired
an
interest
in
several
hundred
thousand
shares
of
stock.
the
bank
attempted
to
obtain
the
same
kind
of
high
quality
investment
range
securities
that
an
investor
might
select.
and
the
fraud
practiced
on
the
bank
deceived
it,
into
believing
that
it
was
obtaining
valuable
securities
traded
on
the
public
securities
markets--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
would
present
the
question
whether
the
fraud
was
in
the
disposition
of
the
security
for
value.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
possible
that
that
would...
the
language
is
in,
rather
than
in
connection
with,
section
10(b)
says
"in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale--
"
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--17(a)
says
"in
a
disposition
of
an
interest
or
security.
"
--and
it
may
be
that
those
fraudulent
representations
are
sufficiently
related
to
the
disposition
of
an
interest
to
be
embraced;
that
would
be
a
factual
question
i
would
submit,
that
would
be
presented
to
the
finder
of
fact.
but
it
may
be
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
would
certainly
be
covered,
and
it
may
be
that
the
statute
reaches
a
bit
beyond
that,
but--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
don't
have
to
reach
that
here,
since
the
fraud
went
directly
to
the
value
of
these
certificates.
petitioner
finally
argues
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
federal
government
to
concern
itself
with
fraudulent
pledges
which
he
believes
to
be
a
matter
of
primary
concern
to
the
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
take
it
terribly
seriously,
no.
most
banks
today
are
insured
by
the
federal
government,
and
the
welfare
of
those
banks
and
the
nation's
banking
system,
is
of
profound
importance
to
the
federal
government.
it's
therefore
not
surprising
that
congress
expected
that
the
federal
securities
laws
would
play
an
important
role
in
protecting
banks
against
this
kind
of
misconduct.
as
congress
stated,
in
the
securities
exchange
act,
"federal
regulation
and
control
of
securities
transactions
is
essential.
"
and
i
quote,
"to
protect
and
make
more
effective
the
national
banking
system
and
the
federal
reserve
system.
"
congress
expressly
declared
that
manipulation
of
securities
prices
is
injurious
to
the
national
banking
system
because
it
tends
to
"prevent
the
fair
valuation
of
collateral
for
bank
loans
and
obstructs
the
effective
operation
of
the
national
banking
system.
"
in
this
case,
petitioner's
activities
had
precisely
that
effect.
petitioner
prevented
the
fair
valuation
of
collateral
for
bank
loans
through
manipulation
and
deception
which
caused
the
bank
to
believe
that
it
was
receiving
valuable
securities
rather
than
worthless
pieces
of
paper.
the
hearings
that
preceded
the
1975
amendments
to
the
federal
securities
laws
reiterate
that
fraudulent
pledges
are
of
great
importance
to
the
federal
government.
those
hearings
which
are
summarized
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
point
out
that
organized
criminal
groups
today
prey
on
federally
insured
banks
by
pledging
worthless,
counterfeit,
and
stolen
securities
on
a
massive
scale.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
quite
agree,
your
honor,
i
quite
agree.
i
only
raised
this
in
response
to
the
argument
that
policy
works
against
the
position
we're
taking.
we
think
policy
considerations
strongly
support
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
as
your
honor
suggests,
the
plain
meaning
is
dispositive
here,
and
that's...
we
rely
four-square
on
the
plain
meaning
principle.
but
in
response
to
petitioner,
i
merely
point
out
the
grave
policy
issues
that
are
stake
here.
congressman
pepper
summarized
those
issues
in
the
hearings
on
conversion
of
worthless
securities,
where
he
stated,
"our
investigation
discloses
that
there
is
a
national
apparatus
of
individuals
who
are
continually
engaged
in
organized
criminal
conduct,
directly
concerned
with
commercial
transactions.
"
"the
essence
of
their
activities
is
to
give
worthless
securities
a
facade
of
value
and
respectability,
and
then
convert
the
worthless
paper
into
hard
cash.
"
"these
individuals
move
across
state
lines,
victimizing
small
banks,
insurance
companies
and
stock
brokerage
institutions.
"
"local
law
enforcement
is
entirely
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
scheme
which
is
planned
in
california,
prepared
in
new
jersey,
and
executed
in
ohio.
"
these
hearings
refer
again
and
again,
to
fraudulent
pledges
as
primary
means
for
victimizing
banking
institutions.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
are,
your
honor.
we
refer
to
them
not
as
legislative
history,
but
as
answers
to
the
policy
arguments
that
the
federal
government
isn't
concerned
in
this
area.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no
sir.
they
were
directed
at
frauds
of
all
kinds,
including
organized
crime
frauds.
as
senator
jackson
concluded
in
the
hearings
on
thefts
and
frauds,
and
i
quote,
"the
situation
is
so
dangerous
and
serious,
and
strong
federal
action
is
warranted.
"
in
sum,
if
this
court
were
disposed
to
look
to
policy
considerations
in
this
case,
those
considerations
provide
additional
compelling
reasons
for
enforcing
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
precisely
as
congress
has
written
them.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
