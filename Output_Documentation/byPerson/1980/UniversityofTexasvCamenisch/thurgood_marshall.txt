mr.
zwiener,
do
you
know
of
any
evidence
that
is
less
reliable
in
a
courtroom
than
a
newspaper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
the
$31,000?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
true
that
$31
million
to
texas
is
like
$31,000
to
most
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
say
that
it's
not
in
this
case,
rather
than
to
continue
to
say
it's
irrelevant?
justice
marshall
you're
digging
deeper
all
the
time.
well,
the
statute
imposes
no
such
requirement
or
criterion
whatsoever.
justice
marshall
did
you
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
that
point?
