he
might
even
be
more
qualified
because

yes,
but,
mr.
pollak,
what
if
the
all
of
the
$31
million
was
specifically
allocated
to
other
programs
within
the
university?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
a
problem;
you
would
have
a
little
problem
then,
wouldn't
you?
what...
does
the
record
show
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
show
that
any
of
the
$31
million
is
sort
of
a
block
grant
to
the
university
to
do
with
it
what
it
wants
to
do?
justice
white
well,
does
it
disclose
any
part
of
it
goes
for
overhead,
administration,
research,
generally,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
white
well,
that
might
be
all,
technically,
logically,
it
could
be
for,
all
$31
million
is
allocated
to
another
single
program
within
the
university.
it
could
be.
