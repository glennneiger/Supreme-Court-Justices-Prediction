mr.
buscemi,
before
you
commence,
may
i
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions?
would
the
government's
position
be
the
same
if
the
funding
were
$31,000
rather
than
$31
million,
just
generally
to
the
university?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
suppose
my
question
is
whether
or
not
the
government
has
the
authority
under
the
constitution
to
order
the
elimination
of
what's
characterized
as
this
discrimination,
but
irrespective
of
funding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know.
i
just
wondered
whether
it
had
been
considered.
my
next
question
is
whether
or
not
in
light
of
the
position
in
your
brief
that
the
need
of
the
particular
student
is
wholly
irrelevant.
is
that
issue
before
the
court,
financial
need?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
that's
my
second
question.
but
the
first
one,
i
don't
think
it's
made
clear
in
the
assignments
in
the
petition
in
which
it
states
the
question,
that
that
question
is
before
us.
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
not
before
us
at
this
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
the
question's
here,
the
government's
position
is
that
financial
need
is
irrelevant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
really
think
the
congress
of
the
united
states
intended
financial
need
to
be
irrelevant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
without
regard
to
the
federal
funds
provided,
and
without
regard
to
the
financial
need
of
the
individual
that
claimed
this
help?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
suggested
$31,000
instead
of
$31
million.
