mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
my
argument
to
the
primary
issue
here,
which
is
whether
regulation
84.44(d)
is
within
the
authority
conferred
by
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
as
that
regulation
was
applied
in
this
case
to
require
provision
of
an
interpreter
to
a
qualified
handicapped
person
who
had
been
admitted
to
the
master's
degree
program
of
texas
university
in
education.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
sir,
we
accept
that,
that's
the
interpretation
in
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion
for
the
unanimous
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
it's
admitted
in
spite
of,
and
that's
clearly
made
in
the
powell
opinion
for
the
court
in
southeastern
community
college,
and
this
case
does
not
re-present
that
issue;
indeed
the
hew
regulations
make
that
clear.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
to
the
extent
that
the
argument
presented
by
my
worthy
colleague
suggested
that
we're
taking
a
position
that
persons
may
be
required
to
be
admitted
who
cannot
press
the
buttons.
we
are
not
taking
that
position.
indeed,
your
honor,
the
case
comes
to
the
court
on
a
stipulated
record
which
we
think
is
significant.
it
provides
(1)
that
camenisch
is
a
deaf
man;
(2)
that
he
is
a
qualified
handicapped
person,
meeting
all
the
academic
and
technical
requirements
of
the
program;
(3)
that
he
needs
the
services
of
an
interpreter--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that's
correct.
indeed,
the
record
establishes
that
this
man
has
gone
through,
completed,
and
received
his
master's
degree,
so
he--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that's
correct.
that
is
a
stipulated
fact,
texas
has
stipulated
he
is
a
qualified
handicapped
individual.
that
is
a
major
distinction,
from
this
case,
from
the
southeastern
community
college
case,
which
was
an
admissions
case.
now--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--there
is
no
suggestion--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--that's
correct.
we
know
from
the
record
that
he
was
the
acting
dean,
at
the
time
the
case
arose,
of
the
east
campus
of
the
school
for
the
deaf
of
the
university
of
texas.
now--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--we
are
speaking
about,
mr.
justice
stewart,
subpart
(e)
which
applies
only
to
postsecondary
institutions;
that's
correct.
and
84.44(d)
applies
to
postsecondary
institutions.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
elementary
and
secondary
schools,
which
is
a
different
subpart,
do
have
a
requirement
for
the
children
to
be
provided
with
interpreters,
as
hew
has
interpreted
its
regulations.
that
is
not
raised
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think,
while
the
hew
regulations
for
higher
education
have
been
drawn
with
the
concerns
expressed
by
universities
and
colleges
during
the
comment
period
respecting
costs,
and
so
as
to
provide
a
limited
obligation.
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
"the
obligation"
runs
throughout,
because
i
think
it's--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--the
obligation
imposed
by
the
statute
runs
throughout;
that's
right.
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
its
application
has
drawn
regulations
which
limit
the
obligation
in
several
respects,
and
i
am
not
master
of
the
regulations
which
they
have
drawn
respecting
the
elementary
and
secondary
schools,
since
that
was
not
the
issue
that
arises
here,
but
rather
84.44(d)
as
your
honor
suggests,
which
applies
to
the
postsecondary
schools.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
don't
represent
that.
what
i
was
representing
was
that
hew
in
44(d)
drew
a
limited
regulation
which
there's
some
indication
in
mr.
zwiener's
argument
that
the
university
may
in
certain
circumstances
not
be
required
to
provide
an
interpreter.
for
instance,
if
it's
a
laboratory
course
where
oral
communication
is
not
relevant,
it
would
not
need
an
interpreter,
but
if
the
situation
is
such
where
a
transcript
of
the
classroom
proceedings
or
classroom
notes
could
be
provided,
the
university
can
take
that
route.
additionally,
hew
has
indicated
that
there
are
other
sources
of
funding
and
that
its
purpose
is
to
assist
the
recipients
of
federal
funds
in
utilizing
vocational
education
funds
or
private
charitable
funds
or
other
sources
of
money.
so
that
in
drawing
the
regulation,
there
was
some
attention
paid
to
tailoring
it
to
these
financial
concerns.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
record
and
stipulation
indicates
that
mr.
camenisch
and
his
wife
had
earnings
in
excess
of
$23,000.
mr.
camenisch's
earnings
were
$11,600,
i
believe.
the
record
shows
that
the
university
received
an
application
for
financial
aid
from
mr.
camenisch
and
that
it
found
him
not
eligible
for
financial
aid.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
university
of
texas
has
urged
that
the
regulation
is
satisfied
by
a
financial
means
test.
and
indeed,
we
believe
it
is
not
satisfied.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
take
the
same
position,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
statute
does
not
make
lack
of
financial
means
a
condition
of
the
rights
which
it
guarantees;
that
is
our
position.
and,
indeed,
the
hew
regulations
have
been
interpreted
by
the
agency
charged
with
their
interpretation
so
as
to
not
permit
a
financial
means
test
to
be
applied.
we
do
not
understand,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
texas
has
urged
upon
this
court
that
it
satisfies
the
regulation
except
as
it
may
have
argued
this
morning
by
a
financial
means
test.
we
understand,
looking
at
page
10
of
its
brief,
that
texas
says
that,
concedes
that
44(d)
of
the
hew
regulations
provides
an
entitlement
to
the
provision
of
an
interpreter,
and
so
we
come
before
the
court
this
morning
and
urge
that
44(d)
with
its
provision
of
the
entitlement
is
within
the
statute
and
lawful,
and
entitles
mr.
camenisch
as
the
two
courts
below
ruled
to
the
provision
of
the
interpreter;
and
we
say
that
the
legislative
history
and
words
of
504
show
that
congress
had
in
mind
an
equal
opportunity
for
the
handicapped,
that
it
sought
to
provide
against
the
effective
exclusion
of
the
handicapped
from
programs
to
which
they
were
admitted.
indeed,
that
is
a
particular
emphasis
in
the
'73
act
legislative
history
that
there
was
a
concern...
senator
humphrey
expresses
it...
that
the
concern
is
not
only
prejudice,
but
the
presence
of
barriers,
the
lack
of
services,
which
effectively
exclude
the
handicapped,
and
we
have
here
a
qualified
handicapped
person;
he's
admitted
to
the
program;
the
absence
of
a
service
effectively
excludes
him
from
a
classroom
proceeding
with--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--your
honor,
the
stipulation
provides...
pages
30,
31,
and
32...
that
the
university
of
texas
receives
$31.4
million.
that's
on
page
32
of
the
appendix.
the
stipulation
further
provides
that
this
man
is
admitted
to
the
graduate
program
in
the
university.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
program
specificity
issue
has
been
presented
to
any
of
the
courts
below,
that
it
was
not
briefed,
it
was
not
argued,
it
was
not
decided,
and
indeed
to
the
extent
that
it
is
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
it
was
not
ruled
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit.
and
i
believe
i'm
correct
as
to
the
decisions
of
the
court,
that
where
an
issue
was
not
presented,
briefed,
argued,
decided
below,
and
then
is
put
into
a
petition
for
rehearing,
that
that
issue
does
not--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--my
position
is
that
the
aid
received
by
this
university,
$31.4
million,
aid
to
the
university
satisfies
the
requirement
of
504.
mr.
camenisch
is
an
admitted
student
to
the
university.
the
stipulation
provides
the
university
receives
$31.4
million.
that's
satisfied.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
issue
has
not
been
litigated
and
presented,
and
indeed
there
are
interrogatories
in
the
tail
end
of
this
brief
in
which
mr.
camenisch
sought,
following
the
decision
on
the
preliminary
injunction,
this
case
arises
before
this
court
on
a
preliminary
injunction
needed
by
mr.
camenisch
in
order
that
he
could
attend
the
summer
session.
there
are
interrogatories
in
the
case
which
was
proceeding
ahead
on
the
merits,
in
which
mr.
camenisch
sought
to
elicit,
more
particularly,
information
as
to
the
aid
received
by
the
university
of
texas.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
be
making
that
argument
but
i
would
also
be
strengthened
with
the
detail
of
the
type
of
aid
which
the
university
received.
i
am
not
in
that
position,
mr.
justice--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--my
position
is
that
the
program
to
which
mr.
camenisch
by
the
record
has
been
admitted
is
the
university
program,
and
the
university
program
receives
$31.4
million,
so
that
any
program
specificity--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--where
the
record
shows
that
the
student
has
been
admitted
to
the
program
of
the
university.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--well,
we
would
have
a
different
situation--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--it
does
not
show
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
does
not
show
that
either.
the
extent
of
the
record,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--it's...
i
think
the
limit
is
the
statement
that
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
receives
federal
financial
assistance
in
excess
of
$31.4
million.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
could
be,
your
honor,
and
that
issue
was
not
litigated
below
and
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
urge
the
court
to
proceed
on
the
premise
that
that
requirement
is
satisfied,
but
i
urge
the
court
preliminarily
that
the
issue
is
not
here
and
as
in
lau
and
as
in,
i
believe,
bakke,
the
program
specificity
issue
can
be
passed.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
were
filed
after
the
preliminary
injunction
had
been
granted
by
the
court,
your
honor.
texas
moved
to
stay
further
proceedings
and
the
court
granted
the
stay.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
justice
rehnquist,
they
have
not
been
pursued.
the
case
is
waiting
on
the
merits
below.
and,
indeed,
as
to
the
program
specificity
matter,
that
issue
is
capable
of
going
forward
on
the
merits
just
as
down
below.
this
case
is
here
on
the
review
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
the
interrogatories
are
directed,
i
thought,
to
the
university
of
texas.
i
thought
they
were
directed
to
the
university.
plaintiffs
request
of
defendants,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
on
page
a-75.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
we
come
here--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--the
remaining
proceedings
would
be
pursued
in
light
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
if
that
contention
is
made
against
us,
we
would
endeavor
to
prove
that.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
am
here...
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
the
issue
is
before
the
united
states
supreme
court,
but
i'm
here--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--i
believe
that
in
terms
of
the
way
the
issue
rests
before
the
court,
we
have
proved
enough;
yes,
sir.
i
want
to...
my
time
is
fleeting,
and
i
want
to
at
least
state
that
we
believe
that
this
court
may
hold
the
auxiliary
aid
interpreter
regulation
44(d)
to
be
within
section
504,
consistent,
wholly
consistent
with
this
court's
unanimous
opinion
in
davis.
we
are
not
here
urging
that
there
be
retreat
from
the
davis
case.
that
case
is
decided
and
it
is
a
different
case.
it
is
an
admissions
case,
it
is
significantly
distinguished
from
what
we
have
here
today.
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
ms.
davis
was
an
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
person.
could
she
meet
the
physical
qualifications
needed
for
the
safety
of
the
patients
in
the
program
of
study,
the
clinical
program,
and
could
she
serve
as
a
registered
nurse
in
the
various
activities
of
the
job?
the
college
said
no
and
this
court
decided
that
issue
and
said
she
was
not
an
otherwise
qualified
person,
and
that
the
modifications
that
would
be
required
to
permit
her
to
be
admitted
were
so
substantial
that
they
would
constitute
a
proscribed
or
not-authorized
affirmative
action.
look
at
the
differences
with
camenisch.
he's
a
qualified
handicapped
person;
he's
been
admitted
to
the
program
by
the
university.
there
is
no
modification
of
the
academic
program
required,
there
is
no
lowering
of
standards
required.
the
hew
regs
read
directly
on
the
camenisch
request.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
this
case
involves...
pardon
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
he
does.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
first,
i
would
say
that
there
are
three
provisions
that
congress
has
chosen
to
apply.
there
shall
be
no
denial
of
benefits,
there
shall
be
no
exclusion
from
participation,
and
otherwise,
discrimination
is
proscribed.
and
we
say
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
before
you
to
decide,
and
that
we
cannot
come
to
you
with
all
of
the
permutations
and
differences
which
other
cases
may
present.
the
issue
that
the
camenisch
case
presents
is
the
need
for
an
interpreter
explicitly
provided
by
the
hew
regulations
and
i
might
say,
that
that
reading
of
the
language
of
504...
the
language
of
504
is
comparable
to
the
language
of
title
vi,
and
hew's
reading
of
that
language
has
been
consistent
now
for
over
a
decade.
it
read
the
language
of
title
vi,
which
this
court
interpreted
in
lau,
to
require
the
elimination
of
communication
barriers.
this
court
unanimously
in
lau
affirmed
that
regulation.
it
reads
the
same
language
which,
mr.
justice
stevens,
you
and
i
are
discussing,
this
discrimination
exclusion
benefit
language,
to
require
the
elimination
of
a
communications
barrier.
in
this
case
consistent
interpretation
of
the
regulations
is
entitled
to
weight.
we
do
not
believe
that
what
is
required
here
is
affirmative
action.
we
believe
it
is
the
steps
which
the
court
affirmed
in
lau,
not
affirmative
action.
thank
you.
