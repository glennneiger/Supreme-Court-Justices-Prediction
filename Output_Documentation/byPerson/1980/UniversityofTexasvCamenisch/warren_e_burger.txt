chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
university
of
texas
v.
camenisch.
mr.
zwiener.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
correctly
understand
that
he
has
been
allowed
to
have
interpreters
in
the
classes
from
time
to
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
the
record
show,
if
anything,
mr.
pollak,
about
the
financial
ability
of
this
respondent
to
provide
his
own
interpreters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
would
you
say
if
the
record
showed
that
he
had
an
income
of
$100,000
a
year
from
a
family
trust
or
otherwise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
university
must
provide
the
expense
of
an
interpreter
even
if
the
individual
student
has
very
large
means
of
his
own?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
buscemi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
record
showed
a
million-dollar
grant
to
the
medical
school,
and
this
student
is
not
part
of
the
medical
school...
a
$1
million
grant
to
conduct
research
on
cancer.
then
does
that
invoke
the
provisions
of
504,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
position
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
in
relation
to
what
mr.
justice
powell
was
asking
you,
and
what
i
have
put
to
mr.
pollak.
if
it
were
shown
on
this
record
that
this
man
had
$100,000
a
year
income
from
a
trust
from
his
grandfather
or
any
other
source,
do
you
say
that
that's
irrelevant
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose,
mr.
buscemi,
that
suddenly
someone
shows
up
from
poland
or
czechoslovakia
to
get
a
master's
degree
or
a
phd
and
can't
speak
english.
would
you
say
that
lau
would
require,
lau
and
504
here
would
require
the
university
of
texas
to
provide
all
the
necessary
aid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no;
he
can't
speak
english.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
my
hypothesis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
