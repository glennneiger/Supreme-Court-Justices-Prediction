mr.
zwiener,
i
take
it
your
real
position
is
that
the
regulation
that
the
government
has
promulgated
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute,
is
that?
because
you
would
concede
that
the
regulation
would
require
that
you
provide
the
interpreter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
basically,
the
question
is
whether
the
regulation
is
valid
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
university
of
texas
is
the
recipient
of
over
$31
million
of
federal
assistance
and
has
agreed
to
comply
with
section
504
as
a
condition
to
continued
receipt
of
federal
funds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
right,
then,
you
could
have
denied
this
man
admission
to
the
university,
period.
is
that
right,
just
on
the
ground
that
you
don't
like
deaf
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
agree
to
programs
that
are
supported
with
federal
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
wants
to
be,
say,
an
english
major
and
the
english
department
doesn't
get
any
federal
funds,
you
could
say,
we
don't
want
deaf
people
in
the
english
department.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you,
what
is
it
that
would
prevent
you
from
saying
that?
why
couldn't
you
say
that?
just
say,
we
don't
allow
deaf
people
in
the
english
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
you,
you
keep
saying
you
can't
do
it.
but
is
there
a
federal
law
that
prevented
you
from
doing
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
do
not...
what
happens
to
your
argument
that
that
only
applies
to
programs
that
are
funded
with
federal
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
could
in
the
english
department
say,
we
don't
want
deaf
people,
under
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
very
possibly.
under
your
argument
you
have
an
absolute
right
to.
justice
stevens
if
you're
right
about
that;
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
or
not.
justice
stevens
well,
even
assuming
it's
before,
if
you're
right
as
a
legal
matter,
you
have
proved
the
jurisdictional
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pollak,
that
case
involved
the
meaning
of
the
word
"qualified"
in
the
statute.
this
case
involves
the
meaning
of
the
word
"discrimination"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
i
have
is,
how
far
must
one
go
to
comply
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
not
discriminating?
how
far?
that's
sort
of
this
parade
of
horribles
that
your
opponent
raises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
limit
on
the
university's
obligations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
still
not
decided
who
has
to
pay
for
the
interpreter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
issue,
isn't
it,
who
has
to
pay
the
$3,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
university
had
no
statutory
obligation
to
pay
him,
they
can
get
their
money
back
from
this
student.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
what
is
the
source...
i
may
have
just
lost
it
in
the
papers...
the
source
of
the
government's
view
and
your
colleague's
view
that
financial
need
is
irrelevant?
because
84.44(d)
talks
about
such
steps
as
are
necessary,
and
if
they
were
not
necessary
as
a
financial
matter,
would
they
clearly
be
necessary
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
in
the
regulation
itself?
it's
an
interpretation
that
they're?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then,
well,
it's
really
not
necessary
because
he
can
afford
his
own
interpreter?
