justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
zwiener,
your
position
is
that
there's
absolutely
no
affirmative
obligation
under
any
circumstances
toward
the
handicapped?
no
affirmative
obligation?
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
there
is
no
way
of
getting
to
classes
except
by
climbing
several
flights
of
stairs
and
you
have
a
handicapped
person
who
has
to
use
a
wheelchair.
do
you
have
to
provide
a
ramp?
justice
jr.
do
you
have
to
provide
a
ramp
for
that
handicapped
person?
justice
jr.
say
not?
justice
jr.
i'm
assuming
that's
what
it
is,
it's
a
program.
you
do
have
programs.
he
wants
to
be
a
teacher,
for
example.
he
can't
get
to
the
classrooms
unless
he
has--
justice
jr.
--right.
and
you
don't
even
have
to
provide
a
ramp,
in
those
circumstances?
justice
jr.
unless
you
get
the
federal
money
to
finance
the
program?
justice
jr.
and
what's
the
source
of
the
obligation
to
make
that
kind
of
accommodation?
504?
justice
jr.
i'd
still
like
to
know
what's
the
source
of
the
obligation
to
make
that
accommodation.
is
it
504?
justice
jr.
what
i
was--
justice
jr.
--wasn't
davis
a
construction
of
504?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
but
you
are
conceding,
contrary
to
what
you
told
me
at
the
outset
of
your
argument,
that
there
are
some
things
you
have
to
do
for
the
handicapped
under
504.
is
that
right?
if
the
program
receives
federal
assistance?
justice
jr.
does
your
state
statute
reach
so
far
as
to
require
that
you
provide
the
deaf
with
an
interpreter?
justice
jr.
mr.
pollak,
what's
the
evidence
as
to
the
amount
of
the
federal
support
for
this
particular
program?
justice
jr.
let's
get
to
the
merits.
suppose
it
had
been
argued
and
decided
below,
what
would
your
position
here
be?
or
suppose
it
is
jurisdictional?
justice
jr.
i
know,
mr.
pollak,
but
are
we
to
assume
that
$31
million,
whether
or
not
it
supports
this
particular
program,
satisfies
504,
or
are
we
to
assume
that
$31
million,
because
it's
not
otherwise
litigated,
includes
funds,
federal
funds,
to
support
this
program?
which
is
it?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
mr.
pollak,
that's
just
the
point;
it
wasn't.
justice
jr.
what
premise
are
we
to
proceed
on?
that
the
$31
million
satisfies
504
whether
or
not
it
supports
this
particular
program?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
pollak,
to
the
extent
your
case
is
a
1983
action
under
maine
v.
thiboutot,
you
have
to
prove
the
violation
of
the
federal
statute
or
the
constitution,
but
it's
only
the
federal
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
when
do
you
do
that?
now,
if
you
prevail
today,
then
you
go
back
for
a
trial,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
be
an
element
of
your
cause
of
action
to
prove
that
this
particular
program
under
504
was
in
fact
a
program
receiving
federal
financial
assistance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
the
entire
university
educational
program
was
a
"program"
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
in
which
event
you
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
allocation.
justice
jr.
and
the
plaintiff
simply
would
not
have
proved
a
cause
of
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
we
have
only
the
temporary
injunction
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
are
further
proceedings
before
there's
a
final
judgment
on
this,
is
that
it?
