mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
and
especially
the
last
provision
of
that
act,
section
504,
which
reads,
"no
other
qualified
handicapped
individual
will
be
excluded
from
or
denied
the
benefits
in
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
"
now,
in
the
rehabilitation
act
there
were
many
sections,
there
were
many
programs,
all
of
which
set
up
appropriated
money
to
accomplish
the
program.
504
and
503
were
sort
of
catch-all
statutes
at
the
end:
you
will
not
discriminate
against
the
handicapped
in
any
program
receiving
financial
assistance.
petitioners'
first
point,
and
i
think
i
can
characterize
it
as
what
we
consider
the
most
important
point,
is
that
504
does
not
require
the
expenditure
of
any
money
by
an
institution,
no
affirmative
action;
it's
a
neutral
statute
which
says
that
we
will
not
discriminate
the
handicapped.
you
can
participate;
we
will
not
deny
you
participation
in
a
program
or
activity
if
you
are
able
to
participate
in
it.
we
say
that
for
the
federal
government
to
require
any
type
of
affirmative
action
toward
the
handicapped,
it
will
require
a
statute
that's
tied
to
the
spending
power
of
congress.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause,
again
only
requires
the
states
to
be
neutral.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
would
say
not.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
would
say
not,
unless
it's
a
program
in
which,
which
is
designed
to
educate
this
handicapped
in
some
way.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
we
would
also
say,
we
would
also
say
that
it's
not
an
affirmative
action
statute
under
any...
circumstance.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true.
that's
what
we
would
say.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
what
we're
saying.
now,
as
i
said,
we
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
no
more,
so
we
do
have
to
tie,
congress
cannot
dictate
to
the
states
or
to
state
institutions
or
a
private
employer
that
they
provide
affirmative
action
unless
they
tie
it
to
some
money
given
for
a
particular
program
which
the
handicapped
is
a
beneficiary
of.
now,
i
think
we
need
to
make
one
point
clear.
the
university
of
texas,
who
is
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
is
not
heartless,
nor
are
the
other
institutions
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
this
case
itself
will
not
bankrupt
the
university
of
texas,
nor
will
it
bankrupt
the
smallest
state
college
in
texas,
the
interpreter
in
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
your
honor,
that
has
helped
the
university
of
texas
and
texas
a&m.
the
other
universities
down
there
are
not
pleased
with
the
fact
that
these
two
institutions
are
getting
it
all.
well,
to
be
perfectly
frank,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
university
of
texas
may
be
the
richest
university
in
the
country
now,
more
heavily
endowed
because
of
its
oil
properties
than
even
harvard
university.
but
what
frightens
everybody
is
not
this
case.
what
worries
all
state
institutions,
whether
they
be
of
higher
education
or
other,
is
that
the
handicapped
tie
their
demands
to
mainstream
100
deaf
students
at
the
university
of
texas.
we
cannot
segregate
them;
they
want
to
be
separate
in
the
class,
with
an
interpreter
for
each
one.
and
just
take
camenisch
here,
walter
camenisch.
he
got
an
interpreter
to
finish
his
master's
degree.
suppose
he
wished
to
continue
in
a
phd
program,
no
program
having
any
federal
financial
aid?
and
by
the
way,
the
university
of
texas
does
get
a
lot
of
grants,
but
they're
specific
grants
for
research,
that
are
sitting
over
here.
most
of
them,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
are
not
even
close
to
the
main
campus
of
the
university,
they're
out
at
the
balcones
research
center.
there
are
proposals
made,
certain
things
done,
and
we
say
that
program
does
not
infect
the
rest
of
the
university.
but
to
get
back
to
walter
camenisch,
he
gets
his
phd
with
the
services
of
an
interpreter,
the
entire
time,
paid
for
by
the
university
of
texas.
then
he
wishes
to
become
a
faculty
member
of
the
university
of
texas.
he's
otherwise
qualified,
if
he
didn't
have
the
deaf
problem,
but
since
he
can't
communicate
with
students,
they
gave
him
a
job,
the
university
makes
him
an
associate,
or
an
assistant
professor;
he
spends
the
rest
of
his
career,
academic
career,
with
an
interpreter
that
the
university
must
provide
him
under
the
theory
that
walter
camenisch,
the
respondent,
and
the
other
amici
that
support
their
position
want.
now,
to
carry
it
to
the
extreme...
and
really
this
is...
if
you
read
the
briefs,
and,
gosh,
i
can't
even
remember
them
all,
because
they're
just
too
many;
it's
difficult
for
me
to
decide
who
supports
what
position,
but
otherwise...
he's
otherwise
qualified,
without
the
handicap.
now,
this
statute
now
applies
to
the
federal
government.
it
didn't.
and
they're
required
to
take
affirmative
action
under
it;
there's
been
amendments,
but
they
left
the
states
out
when
they
put
the
part
about
the
federal
government.
but
here
is
a
man
who
wants
to
be
a
fighter
pilot
without
hands.
he's
otherwise
qualified;
he's
got
a
good
mind,
he
can
read
the
gauges.
he
just
can't
move
the
buttons,
punch
the
buttons
and
the
dials.
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him?
a
ruling,
like
what's
asked
for
by
the
respondent,
will
put
this
court,
and
all
the
courts,
and
all
the
institutions,
the
federal
government,
not
only
the
states,
in
a
situation
of
with
a
little
affirmative
action,
or
a
whole
lot
of
it,
in
the
case
of
a
fighter
pilot
without
hands.
where
does
it
stop,
is
the
point
i'm
making?
now,
again,
the
university
of
texas
is
not
heartless,
and
even
in
its
deaf
programs...
i
mean,
even
in
its
academic
programs,
it
does
provide
deaf
interpreters
where
there's
a
financial
need.
there
have
been
millions
of
dollars
spent,
some
of
it
federal
money,
some
of
it
state
money.
we've
got
a
state
statute
that
forbids
us
from
discriminating
against
the
handicapped
and
makes
us
make
building
alterations.
so
we
have
spent
a
lot
of
money.
my
feelings
and
sentiments...
i
was
interested,
coming
in
last
night,
picking
up
a
paper,
hearing
about
the
unfortunate
tragedy
as
far
as
the
president
is
concerned,
but
the
paper
that
i
picked
up:
u.s.
regulations>
["]--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--you're
right,
your
honor.
you're
right,
your
honor.
i
certainly
endorse
that,
but
here,
george
washington
university
is
worrying
about
it
and
they're
worrying
about
elevators
for,
i
believe,
seven
handicapped
people;
seven.
so
the
expenditure,
they're
just...
you
have
to
spend
too
much
for
the
return.
and
again,
i'm
not
unsympathetic
to
the
handicapped
but
society
can
only
support
so
much,
and
we're
saying
that
this
statute,
as
respondents
would
have
us
to
interpret
it,
just
the
imagination
boggles.
and
that
is
why
we're
up
here
with
this
case.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
it's
also
a
question
whether
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit
is
correct
in
saying,
not
just
under
the
regulations,
i
think,
but
i
think
they
went
under
the
statute,
so
we
do
have
that
decision.
we're
saying
that
that's
incorrect.
we're
saying,
as
many
courts
have
interpreted
this
statute,
that
they're
incorrect.
now,
our
second
point
is
that
504
does
not
confer
a
private
cause
of
action.
i
would
have
rather
argued
this
point
before
this
court
decided
maine
v.
thiboutot,
because
i'm
not
sure
exactly
how
to
handle
this
private
cause
of
action
now,
since
perhaps
we
don't
have
to
state
it
but
just
have
a
statute
and
have
a
beneficiary,
and
then
we
have
a
1983
cause
of
action.
but
i
would
say
that
congress
can
enact
a
statute
like
this
one,
and
certainly
it
could
have
put
explicit
language
in
the
statute
that
would
say,
private
plaintiffs
cannot
bring
suit;
we
do
not
mean
this
statute
to
cover
that
type
of
situation.
again,
as
i
say,
i
would
have
been
much
more
comfortable
arguing
this
point
before
the
maine
v.
thiboutot
case,
if
i
am
pronouncing
it
anywhere
close
to
being
right.
now,
something
that's
not
in
our
brief
is
an
amendment
to
the
rehabilitation
statute,
which
is
505.
and
i
point
this
out.
i
feel
that
the
respondent
in
the
principal
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
civil
liberties
union
and
its
companion
amici
are
misquoting
505.
they
say
that
now
that
we
have
505,
which
does
permit
private
causes
of
action
in
certain
circumstances,
there's
no
question.
however,
they
talk
in
terms
of
a
private
cause
of
action
going
to
504.
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
it
goes
to
501,
which
is
an
employment
type
of
statute,
and
under
that
statute
a
private
cause
of
action
is
authorized.
all
the
remedies
provided
by
title
vi
are
authorized,
but
not
504,
as
is
said
by
respondent,
and
also
the
brief
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
its
companions
on
the
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
the
strongest
evidence,
i
think,
that
we
have
of
congressional
intent,
is
that
they
did
provide
a
private
cause
of
action
for
a
program
designed
to
increase
the
employment
of
the
handicapped,
which
is
501,
but
did
not;
504.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
i'm
reading
the
statute
correctly.
now,
our
third
point
is...
and
this
is
critical;
it
ties
into
the
first
point...
that
504
refers
to
a
program
and
activity
that
receives
federal
financial
assistance
and
that's
what
it
means,
a
program
and
activity.
just
because
the
university
of
texas
maritime
center
down
on
the
coast
gets
a
grant
to
study
the
fishing
conditions
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
doesn't
mean
that
504
applies
to
freshman
english
in
austin.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
are
saying
that--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--that's
true.
it
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
in
the
5th
circuit.
i
did
not
try
this
case
in
the
trial
court
nor
i
didn't
handle
the
original
brief.
i
did
make
the
argument
for
the
first
time
in
the
5th
circuit
and
put
the
argument
into
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
and
then
before
this
court.
we
say
that
it
is
properly
before
this
court
because
it's
a
jurisdictional
question.
you
see,
it's
a
threshold
question.
a
plaintiff
cannot
show
that
he's
entitled
to
any
relief
without
first
showing
that
the
program
about
which
he's
complaining
receives
federal
financial
assistance.
again,
we're
saying
that's
a
threshold
question
which
must
be
proved.
now,
we
do
have
some
briefs
here
that
say
that
it's
our
burden
to
prove
that
the
program
does
not.
i
would
say
that
would
go
in
the
teeth
of
a
very,
of
a
decision
this
court
rendered
just
a
short
time
ago
involving
a
texas
agency,
the
texas
department
of
human
resources
v.
burdine,
where
someone
sues
because
he's
been
discriminated
against;
he's
got
to
show
a
little
discrimination
first
before
the
defendant
has
to
do
anything.
and
we're
saying
that
this
question,
the
program-specific,
is
jurisdictional.
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
it
before
he
could
even
go
forward
with
anything
in
his
case.
and
i
would
try
a
case
that
way
the
next
time
we
go
around.
and
we
say
that
burdine
mandates
the
fact,
the
premise,
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
we
did
stipulate
that
the
university
got
$31
million.
we
didn't
stipulate,
so
far
as
i
know,
that
we
agreed
to
comply.
now,
each
program,
each
program
that's
funded
by
the
federal
government...
and
i
would
say
that
of
that
$31
million
i
don't
know
that
anybody
knows
whether
those
are
student
loans,
by
the
way,
or
whether
it's
just
grants
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
let's
take
the
ordinary
grant.
a
proposal
may
be
paid
to
the
university
or
sometimes
the
federal
government,
some
agency
that
needs
some
research
done,
will
come
to
the
state.
they
will
get
together,
agree
on
what
will
be
done;
the
federal
government
will
advance
the
money;
they'll
have
a
budget,
so
much
for
salary,
so
much
for
this,
so
much
for
that.
and
the
federal
government,
the
state
government,
or
the
particular
agency
involved,
with
respect
to
that
program,
will
agree
not
to
discriminate
under
title
vi
and
sometimes
under
504,
although
a
lot
of
the
grants
have
not
yet
gotten
504
into
them.
but
that
is
true.
we
say
we
agree
not
to
discriminate
with
respect
to
this
grant
and
with
respect
to
dispersal
of
this
federal
money
which
we're
getting.
so,
i
would
say
that
we
haven't
stipulated
ourselves
out
of
court.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir,
we
could
not
do
that.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir,
we
could
not
do
that.
we
could
deny
him
admission
to
the
university
if
he
did
not
have
the
entrance
requirements,
even
though
he
would
say,
i
had
a
more
difficult
getting
my
education
because
i
am
deaf
and
therefore
i
am
not
in
the
top
quarter
of
my
class,
or
i
don't
have
a
certain
score
on
the
sat.
i
have
a
difficult
time
passing
these
tests
because
of
my
disability.
but
we
could
not...
if
he
had
the
scores...
we
could
not
say,
we
do
not
like
deaf
people--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--we
don't
like
blind
people,
we
don't
like
funny-looking
people--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--we
could
say
it,
and
i
would
say
that
if
we
did
that,
and
they
were
otherwise
qualified,
brought
their
own
interpreter
along,
were
able--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--504;
it's
in
the
statute.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
all
right;
you're
right,
your
honor,
you're
right.
because--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--we
very
possibly
could,
under
the
ultimate--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir,
he
was
always
allowed
interpreters,
and
we
would
say,
the
reasonable
accommodation
which
southeast
community
college
v.
davis
refers
to
is
permitting
an
interpreter
to
be
present,
permitting
an
interpreter
to
distract,
if
you
will...
and
there
are
some
people
that
fussed
about
some
of
our
city
council
meetings.
they
said
that
the
interpreter
up
there
bothers
me,
i
can't
keep
track
of
what's
going
on.
but,
yes,
i
think
we
have
to
make
that
accommodation,
perhaps.
and
we
would
have
to...
a
professor
who
had
a
rule
that
lectures
could
not
be
tape-recorded
might
have
to
bend
that
rule
for
the
blind
student
so
he
could
record
the
lectures.
that
kind
of
accommodation.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
say...
without
buying
all
of
my
argument,
my
argument
ultimately
goes,
as
indicated,
to
the
fact
that
504
doesn't
require
us
to
do
anything
unless
the
program
receives
federal
financial
monies.
but
if
it
has
any
effect
on
just
a
general
handicap
situation...
you
see,
i
would
say,
ultimately--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--well,
i
would
say
it's
this
court's
opinion
in
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis.
my
argument,
of
course,
goes
a
little
further
than
that.
my
argument
goes
to
the
fact
that
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--doesn't
protect
the
handicapped,
and
therefore--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--yes,
sir.
and
that's
why
i
would
say
that
davis
maybe
requires
us
to
do
that
even
though
using
my
argument,
and
you've
already
adopted
that--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--if
the
program
receives
federal
assistance.
now,
i'm
not...
i
must
be
dense
this
morning.
since
this
court
construed
504
to
do
something,
i'm
saying
that
you
have
decided
it
must
do
something.
now,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
your
honor,
and
your
question,
in
a
way,
our
state
statute...
we
have
a
state
antidiscrimination
statute
that
would
require
us
to
admit
the
deaf
student
and
not
discriminate
on
account
of
this
particular
handicap,
and
we
say
that's
entirely
within
the
powers
of
the
state
without
the
federal
government.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
actually,
one
of
the
problems
that
we've
had
in
this
case,
and
again
i
think
these
monies
are
confused
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs...
there's
a
lot
of
money
that
goes
to
the
states
for
assistance
to
the
handicapped,
but
it
does
not
go
to
the
universities,
it
goes
to
the
texas
rehabilitation
commission.
by
the
way,
texas
has
a
constitutional
amendment
that
says
we
cannot
give
money
away,
which
this
would
be.
we
had
to
have
a
constitutional
amendment
to
permit
the
rehabilitation
commission
to
give
money
to
the
handicapped.
we
had
to
have
a
similar
one,
it
was
an
earlier
one,
for
our
welfare
department.
so,
you
know,
there
isn't
any,
but
there's
a
lot
of
money
that
goes
to
the
texas
rehabilitation
commission
and
other
rehabilitation
commissions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
respondents
have
been
suing
the
rehabilitation
commissions
and
been
winning
some
of
the
cases,
and
probably
more
justifiably
so.
and
perhaps
they
should
be
the
persons
primarily
responsible.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
to
reply
to
the
respondents
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
if
i
might,
your
honor.
the
program-specific
situation
was
considered
by
the
5th
circuit
probably
as
early
as
any
court.
in
the
finch
case,
which
was
cited
in
my
brief...
and
i
think
that
their
logic
was
excellent
here;
this
was
a
title
vi
case,
a
public
school
that
did
receive
some
federal
monies.
but
the
court
said,
just
because
there
were
problems
somewhere
in
the
school,
we
are
not
going
to
cut
off
all
the
federal
monies
and
do
away
with
a
lot
of
beneficial
programs.
the
money
had
to
be
identified
with
the
program.
that
was
a
'67
case,
i
think,
long
before
this
came
up,
and
i
would
like
to
say
a
word,
i
think,
about
lau.
well,
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
regulations,
if
the
court
will
permit.
the
regulations
are
strange
because
apparently
a
person
has
to
buy
his
wheelchair
but
he
may
be
able
to
get
some
sort
of
tape
to
help
study,
so
there
is
absolutely
no
consistency
with
what
is
required
by
the
hew
regulations.
but
we
are
not
really
complaining
about
the
regulations
except
to
say
that
the
statute
doesn't
permit
any
of
them.
but
they
are
strange.
i
don't
know
what
we'd
do
with
eyeglasses
for
those
that
are
severely
handicapped.
and
the
danger
that
occurred
to
me
when
the
arguments
were
being
made,
one
of
the
dangers
of
this
504
is
that
we
had
an
employee
at
the
university
of
texas
health
science
center
at
tyler,
he
was
almost
blind.
he
could
see
with
things,
perhaps,
an
inch
from
him.
he
was
employed
to
work
on
wards
and
read
charts,
to
fill
syringes.
he
represented
at
the
time
that
he
came
with
us
that
new
technology
would
permit
him
to
get
new
glasses
that
he
would
be
able
to
handle
his
work
problem.
well,
that
didn't
work
out
that
way,
and
it
was
not
good.
he
couldn't
read
the
charts.
he
could
not
read
the
markings
on
the
syringes
that
he
filled.
and
he
was
working
with
patients
that
were
not
seriously
ill,
but
he
could
have
by
some
of
his
activities
made
them
so,
rendered
them
so.
hew
investigated
and
said,
you've
got
to
get
somebody
to
make
the
rounds
with
him
to
read
the
charts.
you've
got
to
get
him
a
syringe
that
has
raised
characters
on
it
so
that
he
will
be
able
to
fill
it
properly,
i
think
it's
just
outrageous,
but
that's
what
scares
us;
not
this
case.
that's
the
thing
that
scares
us.
now--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--and
in
this
case,
to
summarize,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
504
requires
the
universities
to
do
nothing;
not,
certainly
not
to
spend
money.
with
respect
to
lau,
lau
was
not
decided
under
the
constitution,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
was
under
title
vi
and
in
that
case
there
was
no
question
of
program
specific;
everybody
assumed
that
the
school
district
got
substantial
federal
support.
title
vi
says
you
will
not
discriminate
with
respect
to
race.
now,
i
would
say
that
lau
was
probably
wrongly
decided.
i
would
decide
it
differently
because
i
would
say
that
title
vi
says
we
cannot
discriminate
in
a
program
receiving
federal
financial
aid,
but
it
doesn't
require
us
to
go
out
of
our
way
not
to
"discriminate".
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
we
were
talking
earlier,
your
honor,
that
the
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not,
has
nothing
to
say
about
handicap
for
discrimination.
all
we
have
to
do
is
treat
them
neutral.
if
they
can't
play
football
and
they
have
no
legs,
well,
that's
all
we're
required
to
do;
they
can
have
a
chance
to
come
out.
we
would
say
the
constitution...
and
that's
why
i
say
that
lau
may
be
wrongly
decided
from
the
viewpoint
i'm
advancing
here,
that
unless
you
tie
a
direction
to
the
states
or
to
private
industry
not
to
discriminate
against
the
handicapped
to
money,
then
there
is
no
federal
power
to
prevent
discrimination
against
the
handicapped.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
addresses?
yes,
sir.
it
says,
very
simply,
that
a
recipient
will
not
discriminate
against
the
handicapped
in
any
program
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
now,
if
the
program
receives
federal
financial
assistance
and
we
agree
that
we
will
not
discriminate,
if
we
just
agree
not
to
discriminate,
i
might
say
that
we
don't
have
to
do
anything.
we
offered
them
the
job
merely
because
we
don't
like
the
deaf,
we
can't
refuse
to
do
it,
but
we
don't
have
to
help
them.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
may
be
misstating
it,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--i
didn't...
i
don't
see
that
he
did
state
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
but--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--but
not
on
that
ground;
no,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir,
they
did.
which
is
why
i
talked
about
the
constitution
today,
because
i'm
worrying
about
maine
v.
thiboutot
and
then
this
statute.
but
again,
because
it's
a
private
cause
of
action,
i
think
there'll
be
certain
statutes
that
you
might
say
a
plaintiff
is
a
beneficiary
of
that
would
not
permit
a
private
cause
of
action
to
be
brought,
and
i
would
say
this
is
very
close
to
one
because
there
was
a
very
recent
amendment.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
it
does
say
that.
i
didn't
mean
to
misrepresent
to
the
court,
i
was
just
not
familiar
with
it.
he
does
say--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
we
did
or
not.
i
would
say
that
the
arguments
i've
advanced
here
make
all
that
immaterial.
i
noticed,
in
closing,
that
the
court
had
a
case
in
december,
pennhurst
state
school
and
hospital
v.
halderman,
in
which--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--there
was
discussion
about
the
spending
power
and
the
powers
of
congress
to
do
certain
things.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
thank
you.
