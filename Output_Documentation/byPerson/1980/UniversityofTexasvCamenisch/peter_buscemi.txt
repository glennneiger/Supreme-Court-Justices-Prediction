mr.
peter
buscemi
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
with
a
yes
or
no.
i
think
if
i
had
to
i
would
say
yes,
mr.
justice
powell,
but
i
would
also
say
that
one
of
the
critical
points
in
these
cases,
cases
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act,
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments,
section
504,
is
that
the
recipient
of
federal
funds'
obligation
under
the
statute
as
a
practical
matter
is
invariably
conditioned
by
the
amount
of
federal
aid
that
is
received.
there
is
naturally
a
cost-benefit
calculus,
or
calculation,
that
is
made
by
any
recipient
of
federal
funds.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
issue
is
certainly
not
before
the
court
today.
mr.
peter
buscemi
my
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
powell,
is
that
financial
need
is
not
a
relevant
criterion
under
the
regulation.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
financial
need
is
an
appropriate
criterion
has
been
abandoned
at
this
point
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
don't
think
that
it's
the
theory
on
which
they
bring
the
case
here,
although
i
suppose
that
if
financial
need,
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
financial
need,
notwithstanding
the
regulation,
is
an
appropriate
factor
that
petitioners
might
be
entitled
to
some
relief
from
the
preliminary
injunction.
so
i
don't
want...
i
mean,
they're
challenging
the
preliminary
injunction
but
the
theory
on
which
they're
challenging
it,
the
question
presented,
if
i
understand
the
petition
correctly,
is
not
whether
financial
need
is
an
appropriate
factor,
but
only
whether
section
504
requires
the
expenditure
of
any
money
at
all.
mr.
peter
buscemi
under
this
regulation;
that
is
true.
we
have
not
taken
a
position,
mr.
justice
powell,
whether
a
regulation...
that
should
this
regulation
be
changed,
for
example,
to
make
financial
need
a
relevant
criterion,
whether
such
a
regulation
would
or
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
the
congress
of
the
united
states
intended
to
give
to
funding
agencies
the
power
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
to
implement
the
antidiscrimination,
the
antiexclusion
guarantees
of
section
504.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
certainly
not
without
regard
to
the
federal
funds
provided,
because
as
i
said
at
the
very
beginning,
if
there
were
no
federal
funds
provided--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--if
there
was
$31,000
provided,
the
university
would
of
course
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
that
amount
of
aid
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
imposition
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
the
university
might
well
conclude
that
it
would
rather
do
without.
that's
one--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
one
of
the
areas--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--mr.
justice
marshall,
as
i
understand
the
record,
it
indicates
that
the
$31
million
is
approximately
one-sixth
to
one-seventh
of
the
university
of
texas's
annual
budget.
mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
say
that
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language,
program,
or
activity
is
a
very
difficult
one
that
has
arisen
under
title
vi
and
title
ix,
and
section
504.
there
has
recently
been
a
decision
in
the
district
court
in
michigan
holding
that
an
athletic
program
in
a
university
that
does
receive
substantial
federal
funds
is
nevertheless
not
a
covered
program
or
activity
because
the
federal
funds
do
not
specifically
support
the
athletic
program.
now,
we
don't
know,
in
this
case,
what
particular
activities
of
the
university
are
supported
by
the
$31
million,
but
it
is
not
the
government's
position
that
part
of
that
$31
million
must
go
directly,
for
example,
to
a
professor
who
has
taught
mr.
camenisch
before
he
can
be
covered
by
this
statute.
program
or
activity
has
to
be
defined
in
a
somewhat
broader
way.
now
how
broad
it
should
be,
whether
as
respondent
contends,
it
should
cover
the
entire
university,
the
minute
any
federal
funds
are
received,
or
whether
it
should
be
restricted,
for
example,
to
the
graduate
school
of
arts
and
sciences,
or
to
an
undergraduate
program,
is
not
before
the
court
and
because
that's
difficult--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
the
characterization
of
that
as
jurisdictional,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
it
would
have
no
substantive
obligation
under
the
statutes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
but
i
think
this
court
would
still
have
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
exactly.
i
think
that
is
the
distinction
that
i
want
to
draw
here.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
there
was
really
nothing
that
respondent
could
do
to
avoid
the
situation.
he
went
into
the
district
court
and
said,
i
am
entitled
to
an
interpreter.
the
district
court
said,
give
him
an
interpreter.
and
then
there
was
an
immediate
appeal
by
the
university
of
texas.
there
has
never
been
any
consideration
of
what
the
appropriate
burden
of
proof
should
be,
whether
the
respondent
should
have
to
show
that
the
money
went
to
a
program
or
activity
in
which
he
participated,
or
whether
the
university
is
in
a
better
position
to,
you
know,
prove
that
question
because
they
are
the
ones
who
know
where
the
money
went.
so
all
of
that
is
open.
if
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
5th
circuit,
this
case
is
not
over.
as
respondent
points
out
in
a
footnote
in
his
brief,
there
doesn't
even
need
to
be
a
remand.
there's
automatically
going
to
be
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
in
which
this
and
other
issues
that
may
not
have
been
raised
before--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
there
is
a
substantial
question,
and
i
think
this
is
jurisdictional
under
article
iii.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
mootness
here
and
it
depends
on
how
the
preliminary
injunction
is
characterized.
if
the
injunction
bond
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
then
this
court
retains
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
injunction
bond
is
only
something
that
goes
to
the
ultimate
merits
and
the
preliminary
injunction
is
only
designed
to
hold
the
respondent
harmless
while
the
litigation
is
pending--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--then
the
preliminary
injunction
no
longer
has
any
effect
and
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
this
petition
is
no
longer--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--oh,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
peter
buscemi
just
the
question
of
how
this
petition
should
be
disposed
of.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
that's
why
the
injunction
bond
is
keeping
the
controversy
alive.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
that's
one
of
the
cases
that's
relevant
to
that.
mr.
peter
buscemi
under
the
regulation
that
has
been
promulgated
by
hew
in
implementation
of
this
statute,
financial
need
is
not
a
relevant
criterion.
and
i
wanted
to
respond...
this
gives
me
an
opportunity,
mr.
chief
justice...
to
the
question
mr.
justice
stevens
posed
to
my
colleague
and
that
is,
how
far
do
we
say
that
one
has
to
go
in
order
to
avoid
the
discrimination?
because
i
think
that
is
the
critical
question
in
the
case.
and
the
government's
answer
is,
that
one
has
to
go
as
far
as
the
reasonable
regulations
of
the
agencies
charged
with
enforcing
the
statute
require.
that
is
the
typical
answer
that
the
court
has
given
to
cases
in
which
congress
has
given
to
the
administrative
agencies
a
broad
delegation
of
power
to
enforce
a
particular
provision.
it's
the
rule
that
the
court
applied
in
mourning,
it's
the
rule
the
court
applied
in
thorpe,
and
it's
the
rule
that
the
court
applied
in
lau
under
a
statute
that
is
very
similar
to
this
one,
but
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
provides,
just
as
this
statute
does,
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination.
and
hew
promulgated
regulations
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose
that
said
that
bilingual
instruction
or
some
other
method
of
getting
through
to
oriental
children
in
the
san
francisco
school
district
was
necessary
to
make
the
educational
opportunity
meaningful.
that
surely
would
have
required
the
expenditure
of
some
funds.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
of
course
section
504
would
have
no
application
for
someone,
it
would
be
a
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin,
i
suppose,
what
you're
referring
to.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
don't
think
that
qualifies
as
a
handicap
within
the
meaning
of
section
504.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
correct.
in
any
event,
the
lau
decision
was
not
under
section
504.
it
was
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act,
and
the
question
that
your
honor
poses
is
the
very
question
that
was
reserved
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
you
joined,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
whether,
the
same
result
in
lau
would
have
been
required
had
there
been,
not
1,800
or
3,000
oriental
children
in
the
san
francisco
school
district
that
could
not
understand
their
instruction
but
only
one?
and
we
don't
know
exactly
how
the
regulations
would
have
treated
just
that
one
student.
but
here
the
regulations
are
clearly
designed
to
treat
individual
handicapped
persons.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that
was
the
argument,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
petitioners
made
in
the
district
court.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
agency's
interpretation
of
its
own
regulation
should
govern.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
i
mean,
i
will
have
to
concede
that
the
phase,
"take
such
steps
as
are
necessary.
"
concedes--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that
would
be
a
possible
argument,
and
that's
the
argument
that
was
made,
because
in
the
district
court
petitioners
assumed
that
they
were
required
to
make
some
financial
expenditures
in
some
circumstances
under
the
act.
that's
one
of
the
things
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
it's
only
now
that
they
say
nothing
at
all.
but
they
argued
solely
on
the
basis
of
this
language.
but
it
seems
to
us,
and
petitioners
now
concede
that
this
language
requires
them
to
pay,
irrespective
of
financial
need...
they've
abandoned
that
argument.
and
furthermore,
even
if
they
had
not,
the
consistent
construction
by
the
agency
of
its
own
regulations,
we
believe,
should
govern.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i'll
be
happy
to
adopt
your
formulation,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that
is
not
part
of
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
statute
certainly
does
not
refer
to
financial
need;
that's--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--thank
you.
