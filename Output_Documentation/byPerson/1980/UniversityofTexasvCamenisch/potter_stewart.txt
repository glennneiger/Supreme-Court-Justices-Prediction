justice
stewart
this
argument,
according
to
your
brother,
was
not
raised
until
now,
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
--it's
pretty
clear,
is
it
not,
that
the
statute
does
not
and
cannot
mean
exactly
what
it
says?
it
says
that
no
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
shall
solely
by
reason
of
his
handicap
be
excluded
from
participation
in
any
program
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
well,
let's
assume
a
blind
person
who
would
like
to
be
a
bus
driver
in
a
city
transportation
system
that
receives
federal
assistance,
and
except
for
his
blindness
he
would
be
qualified
but
he
can
clearly
be
excluded
from
being
a
bus
driver
because
of
his
handicap,
because
he's
blind.
justice
stewart
but
the
statute
does
not
mean
precisely
what
it
says?
justice
stewart
well,
the
would-be
airplane
pilot
without
hands
presents
that
issue.
justice
stewart
and
that
he
is
such,
quite
apart
from
his
handicap?
justice
stewart
he's
not
somebody
who
would
be
qualified
except
for
his
handicap.
he
is
somebody
who
is
qualified
despite
his
handicap.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
the
regulations
impose
this
obligation
only
in
institutions
of
higher
learning,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
any
such
requirement
on
secondary
institutions
or
below?
justice
stewart
but,
i
would
think
if
the
statute
means
what
you
say
it
means,
then
the
obligation
would
run
throughout.
justice
stewart
well,
the
statute
doesn't
seem
to
permit
any
compromise
or
accommodation.
it's
either
an
obligation
or
it
isn't.
justice
stewart
and
there
is
a
different
and
lesser
obligation
imposed
upon
secondary
and
primary
educational
institutions?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
sense
it
is
jurisdictional,
and
therefore
in
a
sense
it
is
before
the
court.
let's
assume
that
all
of
this
$31
million
went
to
a
program
operated
by
the
university
down
on
the
gulf,
not
even
in
austin,
in
marine
biology.
then,
unless
the
respondent
is
correct
in
his
broad
argument,
this
should
not
be
a
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance
in
which
the
respondent
is
engaged.
and--
justice
potter
stewart
--well,
let's
say
this
institution
received
no
federal
aid
at
all.
that
would
be
jurisdictional.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
and
it
would
be
jurisdictional.
this
statute
would
be
totally
inapplicable,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
the
question
of
mootness
in
this
case?
the
respondent
has
graduated
and
got
his
degree,
hasn't
he?
justice
stewart
and
he
was
held
harmless,
and
he
has
his
degree
and
he's
gone
and
left
the
university,
hasn't
he?
justice
stewart
nobody
has
to
pay
for
the
interpreter
anymore.
he's
left
the
university.
justice
stewart
well,
this
case
is
the
case
we
have
before
us.
justice
stewart
did
the
plaintiff's
complaint
allege
that
the
program
in
which
he
was
enrolled
received
federal
financial
assistance?
justice
stewart
well,
then,
he
didn't
state
a
case,
did
he?
justice
stewart
well,
that's
quite
important,
i
think.
justice
stewart
i
think
for
your
clarification,
counsel,
i
have
found
the
answer
to
my
question
on
a-5,
paragraph
5,
paragraph
5
of
the
complaint,
which
appears
on
a-5.
justice
stewart
"a
private
institution
of
higher
learning
which
receives
federal
financial
assistance.
"
"and
you
did
not
deny
that
in
your
answer?
"
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
case
i
am
authorized
to
announce
this
morning
is
university
of
texas
against
camenisch,
number
80-317,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
on
march
1,
1978,
the
respondent,
a
deaf
graduate
student
at
the
university
of
texas
filed
a
complaint
alleging
that
the
university
had
violated
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
which
provides
that,
"no
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
in
the
united
states
shall,
solely
by
reason
of
his
handicap,
be
excluded
from
the
participation
in,
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
university
received
federal
funds
and
that
the
university
had
discriminatorily
refused
to
pay
for
a
sign
language
interpreter
for
the
respondent.
the
complaint
asked
that
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas
grant
the
declaratory
relief
and
preliminary
and
permanently
order
the
university
to
appoint
an
interpreter
for
the
plaintiff
while
he
was
a
student
in
good
standing
there.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
which
as
modified
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
by
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
had
acted,
the
university
had
obeyed
the
injunction
by
paying
for
the
interpreter
and
the
respondent
had
been
graduated.
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
only
issue
presently
before
us,
the
correctness
of
the
decision
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction
has
become
moot.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
trial
on
the
merits.
the
chief
justice,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
