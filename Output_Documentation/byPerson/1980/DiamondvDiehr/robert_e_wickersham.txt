mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
does
indeed
involve
the
statutory
construction
of
section
101
and
the
word
"process"
and
we're
all
agreed
on
that.
both
gottschalk
v.
benson
and
parker
v.
flook
make
it
clear
that
one
index
of
having
a
process
which
is
patentable
subject
matter
is
the
transformation
of
state,
changing
something
from
one
thing
to
quite
another
thing.
now,
this
messy,
circular
piece
of
uncured
synthetic
rubber
is
our
starting
material,
or
one
of
the
starting
materials.
i
don't
know
that
you
can
use
it
for
anything
except
to
make
something
else
out
of
it.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
this
is
the
resultant...
thank
you,
judge...
this
is
the
product
as
it
comes
out
to
the
mold,
bonded
to
a
metal
ring
and
changed
permanently,
both
chemically
and
physically
to
an
entirely
different
shape
which
it
will
hold,
and
to
a
chemical
state
that
will
enable
it
to
obtain
the
desired
rigidity
and
other
characteristics
so
that
it
will
operate.
this
particular
device
is
used
as
an
oil
seal
or
shaft
seal
to
prevent
oil
from
running
out
of
a
railroad
roller
bearing
and
thereby
having
the
bearing
burn
up
and
stop
the
whole
train.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
here
is
a
small
one,
a
piece
of
"prets",
still
substantially
useless.
and
here
is
the
precision
product
made
from
it.
this
one
has
been
trimmed,
the
other
one
had
not.
this
is
used
on
an
automobile.
and
those
of
you
who
have
had
to
replace
a
transmission
due
to
a
faulty
oil
seal
or
perhaps
a
wheel
bearing
or
something
will
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
an
important
use
of
the
product.
this
is
what
my
client
mainly
makes.
it
does
make
some
other
products,
such
as
o-rings,
which
are
used
in
some
other
places.
but
basically
the
process
that
we're
involved
with,
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
process,
is
to
change
this
floppy,
rather
useless
material
as
it
stands,
into
a
completely
different
state
or
thing.
and
that
is
done
by
a
process
known
as
molding
under
pressure
with
heat.
the
fact
is
that
chemicals
can
often
change
from
one
chemical
to
another
just
by
the
application
of
heat.
that
is
what
we
are
getting
here.
technically
it's
called
cross-linking.
but
the
fact
is
that
when
we
come
to
cure
it
we
run
into
problems,
and
our
problem
was
that
curing
became
mainly
a
matter
of
guesswork.
we
have
this
equation,
it's
called
the
arrhenius
equation.
i
don't
expect
you
necessarily
to
remember
the
name.
he
was
a
distinguished
swedish
chemist
and
he
received
the
nobel
prize,
not
for
the
equation,
perhaps,
but
for
his
work,
and
this
was
one
of
the
good
fruits
of
his
work.
it's
admittedly
very
old.
we
could
use
that
before,
and
we
could
calculate
with
or
without
a
computer
or
calculator
how
long
we
thought
it
would
take
to
cure.
but
we
really
didn't
know
what
temperature
the
mold
was
at.
we
heat
the
mold
but
molds
have
to
be
opened
to
put
the
material
into
them.
so
we'd
open
the
mold
and
the
operators
would
take
different
times
to
fill
the
mold.
a
typical
cavity
might
have
64
or
128
cavities,
all
to
be
filled.
it
might
have
somewhat
fewer.
you
close
the
mold
and
start
the
time
going.
it
may
be
at
a
different
temperature
from
one
operation
to
another.
a
thermostat...
there
are
two
thermostats
are
on
the
machine,
and
when
it
reaches
a
certain
critical
temperature,
the
upper
end
of
the
temperature-curing
range,
the
thermostat
cuts
it
off
and
it
begins
to
cool
again
until
it
reaches
the
thermostat
at
the
lower
end
of
the
range
and
then
heat
comes
on
again,
and
it
goes
on
and
off,
and
on
and
off,
during
the
curing
process.
but
what
temperature
is
the
material
at
in
the
mold?
well,
we
don't
know
unless
we
actually
find
some
way
of
measuring
it
in
the
mold.
and
when
we
do,
we
find
that
it's
at
different
temperatures
at
different
times.
now,
the
thing
that
this
invention
found
as
a
use
for
a
digital
computer
is
that
combining
that
with
a
constant
temperature
monitoring
located
in
the
mold,
but
not
at
the
cavity,
but
near
the
cavity,
would
enable
us
to
get
readings
often...
well,
constantly,
in
fact,
and
to
calculate
them
segment
by
segment
all
through.
so
when
the
mold's
warming
up,
it's
being
calculated.
that
time
doesn't
result
in
very
much
cure
but
it
has
some
and
we
know
what
it
was
at.
when
it
gets
up
into
the
range
it's
calculated
each
time
at
the
temperature
that
it
is
now.
and
this
constant
reading
of
the
temperature
by
a,
in
a
means
that
will
not
injure
the
product
combined
with
the
constant
recalculation,
not
just
a
calculation...
because
if
we
got
just
one
calculation,
we
wouldn't
be
any
better
off
than
we
were
before,
to
enable
us
to
get
a
better
product--
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
--yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
there
are
quite
a
few
differences
in
there.
the
first
is
that
our
claimed
method
is
a
claim
for
a
process
for
molding
a
precision
synthetic
rubber
product,
whereas,
as
noted
in
the
majority
opinion
particularly
the
alarm
limit
is
a
number
and
the
claim
was
directed
in
that,
to
calculating
a
number
and
then
by
some
means
or
other
which
could
have
been
manual
simply
resetting
the
alarm,
which
is
a
post-solution
step.
in
that
case
the
only
novelty
was
said
to
be
the
equation.
in
our
case
the
equation
is
certainly
not
novel.
we
contend
that
the
combination
has
been
held
novel
by
the
examiner
since
he
withdrew
his
103
rejection
on
the
grounds
of
obviousness,
and
he
never
did
make
a
102
rejection
showing
that
he
didn't
believe
that
there
was
any
lack
of
novelty
in
our
case.
does
that
answer
the
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun?
i
don't
want
to
answer
something
you
didn't
ask,
instead.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
very
good;
all
right.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
see.
well,
i
have...
i
feel
i
have
very
little
difficulty
in
doing
that,
because,
in
the
first
place,
we
have
a
process
that
really
changes
a
material
object.
they
didn't
have
that.
you
see,
we're
not
claiming
a
number.
and
we're
not
manufacturing
numbers.
we're
not
manufacturing
digits
or
binary
coded
decimal
digits
or
a
mathematical
calculation.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
although
novelty
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
question--
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
--on
a
101
issue,
i'll
certainly
tell
you.
the
novelty
in
it,
which
resides
in
the
invention
as
a
whole,
is
the
combination
of
constant
temperature
reading
at
a
place
where
it
will
not
injure
the
product,
combined
with
constant
recalculation.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
using
the
computer.
oh,
there's
no
other
way
to
do
that
good
calculation
that
i
know
of.
i
mean,
you
could
get
a
mathematical
genius
to
do
it
mentally;
it
wouldn't
help
the
novelty
of
the
case
any.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
mr.
justice
white,
if
that
was
it,
i
don't
think
i'd
have
gotten
this
far.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
wouldn't.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
not
exactly,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
problem
in
the
sense
of
knowing
that
you
wanted
to
get
an
exact
cure
and
knowing
that
if
you
knew
the
time
when
you
had
an
exact
cure
you
could
open
it,
that
certainly,
that
part
of
it
was
known.
but
up
to
this
time
the
recalculation
at
frequent
intervals
was
not
at
least
made
use
of,
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
of
course,
that's
more
of
a
novelty--
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
--that
is
true.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
don't
think
we
ever
know
the
number;
we
know
the
product.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
it
could
be
expressed
as
a
number,
mr.
justice
stevens.
actually,
i
don't
believe
in
our
process
that
we
ever
bother
with
what
the
number
is.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
once
our
prime
time
is
reached,
the
mold
opens,
it's
done,
and
we
take
the
thing
out
before
it
overcures.
of
course,
earthquakes
can
be
expressed
as
numbers
but
they're
not
numbers.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
that's
true,
that's
true.
they
might
cost
more
than
the
computer
these
days,
but
that's
true.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
completely
right.
very
few
inventors
just
think
about
what
they
want
to
invent.
some
do,
but
very
few.
and
this
was
made
to
solve
a
problem.
as
you
may
have
noticed,
we've
made
more
than
$400
million
worth
of
these
products
since
we
did
it
and
it
saved
us
about
$25
million,
which
isn't
bad.
the
problem
that
we
had,
for
one
thing,
was
that
by,
when
we
overcured,
as
we
had
to
do
if
we
were
going
to
make
sure
it
was
not
undercured,
that
we
tied
up
all
our
machines.
and
so
we've
been
able
to
increase
production
perhaps
by
ten
percent
at
least,
i
understand,
maybe
more
than
that.
it's
not
quite
clear,
but
the
idea
is,
we've
gotten
much
better
products
and
we
can
produce
more
of
them
in
the
same
time
from
the
same
machines.
i
think
that's
a
very
substantial
indication
that
there's
something
here
that
would
be
patentable.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
it
is,
it
is.
it's
an
indication
also
that
if
you
could
do
it
beforehand
you'd
have
done
it
beforehand.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
don't
think
they
would,
the
way
our
claims
are
worded,
but
it
would
be
an
interesting
case.
i
think,
as
you'll
notice,
our
claims
as
stated,
except
for
claim
11,
the
presence
or
the
digital
computer,
because
we
thought
that
was
the
practical
way
to
do
it.
remember,
we
didn't
know
that
flook
was
going
to
be
decided
when
we
wrote
these
claims.
we
weren't
aware
of
what
the
court
was
going
to
do
in
that
kind
of
thing,
and
the
claims,
i
hope,
are
somewhat
artfully
drawn
from
the
sense
of
patent
law,
because
that's
supposed
to
be
my
profession.
but
they're
not
artfully
drawn
to
get
around
any
particular
decision
anywhere.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
of
course,
we
couldn't
assume
anything
else
here.
it
definitely
was
old
anyway,
whether
we
would
assume
it
or
not.
with
us,
the
point
was
to
put
these
process
elements
together.
process
elements
are
somewhat
different
from
machine
elements,
but
the
operation
is
basically
the
same.
if
we
had
the
computer
and
didn't
monitor
the
temperature
the
way
we
did
or
didn't
use
it
for
frequent
recalculation,
then
we
wouldn't
have
the
same
thing.
i
believe
i
should
touch
a
little
on
the
point
that
the
solicitor
general
brought
up,
that
of
some
prior
art
and
things.
as
i
understand
it,
the
section
101
issue
is
to
be
decided
before
one
goes
into
the
prior
art
and
there's
a
sentence
in
the
case
of
parker
v.
flook
that
says
so,
as
to
the
art
that
he
is
using,
the
gates
and
davis
patents.
i
should
point
out
that
the
examiner
had
considered
them
and
withdrawn
his
section
103
objection
over
them,
and
that
should
indicate
that
at
least
to
one
experienced
man
it
was
not
an
obvious
thing
to
do.
part
of
the
difference
in
those
resided
in
the
product,
of
course.
in
both
those
patents
they're
talking
about
making
rubber
tires,
which
are
rather
huge
things
and
what
we
would
not
call,
in
our
particular
field,
a
precision-molded
product.
you
can
see
on
the
rubber
tires
when
you
get
a
new
one
all
the
flash,
the
extra
material
that's
there.
you
can
see
that
although
it
has
a
certain
definition
and
such,
it's
still
relatively
a
crude
product,
at
least
compared
to
what
we
have.
we
could
not
stick
a
probe
through
our
material
without
completely
ruining
it.
we
couldn't
even
have
capacitance
measuring
devices
going
across
it
starting
from
the
mold
without
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
trying
to
get
a
product
out
of
it
that
would
be
a
satisfactory
product.
it
would
be
too
rough.
it
would
have
these
bumps
on
it.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
in
the
flook
case
seem
to
have
agreed
that
section
101
does
not
call
for
considering
section
102
or
section
103.
that
is
the
exact
conclusion
to
which
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
came
and
why
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
didn't
disturb,
so-called,
the
findings,
so-called,
of
the
patent
office
board
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
think
it
suggested
or
held
that;
i
do.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
think
that
basically,
of
course,
you're
right.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
with
you.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
in
that
sense
and
that
sense
alone,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
the
section
102
and
103
considerations
go
much
deeper
than
that,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
congress
at
any
rate
thought
they
were
separate
and
said
that
they'd
split
the
statute
in
two.
the
section
101
covered
basically
the
classes
of
things
which
could
be
patented,
section
102
covered
the
novelty,
and
section
103
the
question
of
obviousness.
and
i
think
basically
that's
what's
intended.
i
would
say...
you
asked
a
question
about
types
of
inventions
that
do
not
come
under
section
101.
there
are
many,
many
such.
methods
of
doing
business,
for
example;
sales
programs;
the
ideas
for
books,
or
plots.
you
can
enumerate
them
forever.
there's
many
things
that
don't
come
under
section
1.
basically,
section
101,
i
believe,
was
intended
to
protect
inventors
who
came
up
with
something
of
a
physical
embodiment,
some
way
or
other;
at
least
a
physical
embodiment.
now,
numbers
are
not
really
physically
embodied
even
when
we
write
them
out,
as
digits,
in
the
arabic
system.
that's
simply
a
symbol.
the
number
itself
is
still
a
concept.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
intended
by
any
of
the
writers
of
the
constitution
or
the
legislators
in
congress,
at
any
time,
that
people
be
able
to
patent
their
concepts.
but
when
it
gets
down
to
having
something
that
can
be
reduced
to
a
physical
status,
whether
it's
a
composition
of
matter
as
it
was
in
chakrabarty,
under
one
interpretation
anyway;
process
is
under
another,
whether
it's
a
machine
or
whether
it's
some
sort
of
article
that
you
can
sell,
any
of
those
things,
i
think,
certainly
justify
a
patent
as
far
as
section
101
is
concerned.
as
far
as
sections
102
and
103
are
concerned,
examination
is
pretty
strict
at
the
patent
office.
the
product
that
we
have
here,
for
example,
this
little
thing
here,
has
at
least
two
patents
that
cover
it
as
a
product,
because
there
were
two
inventive
concepts
that
were
then
physically
embodied.
that
doesn't
count
the
process.
we
make
other
things
that
aren't
patentable,
or
patented
by
our
process.
i
hope
that
we've
arrived
at
most
of
the
question
because
i
certainly
want
to
take
care
of
any
questions
that
you
have
while
i'm
here.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
these
two
cases?
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i
would
say
they're
quite
different.
i'm
not
trying
to
get
anything
on
a
machine,
they're
not
trying
to
get
anything
on
a
process.
they
impressed
me
that
the
only
thing
they
really
have
in
common
is
the
use
of
section
101
and
the
contention
by
the
commissioner
that
they
both
involve
computer
programs.
by
the
way,
here's
a
computer
program,
some
300
pages,
which
is
used
in
this
process.
we
didn't
disclose
it
in
the
patent
application
because
it
wasn't
necessary,
but
that
is
a
printout
of
the
program.
the
actual
program
are
the
instructions,
of
course,
that
go
into
the
machines
in
the
computer.
we're
not
trying
to
patent
that.
we
don't
want
to
patent
it,
even
if
we
could,
i
couldn't
write
a
claim
300
pages
long
to
cover
it.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
any
computer
is
useless
without
some
program,
once
you
get...
that
is,
except
as
an
object
to
sell
or
something
of
that
nature.
and
so
it's
going
to
be
programmed
some
way
or
other.
but
the
specific
programming
will
depend
on
the
rubber
that
you're
going
to
use,
the
kind
of
mold
you're
using,
its
shape,
and
all
that.
now,
we
have
this,
because
this
controls,
in
effect,
the
whole
plant.
we
can
use
one
computer
to
control
60
machines
and
do
it,
in
the
same
plant.
so
that
we
are
able
to
get
a
lot
of
mileage
out
of
the
computer,
but
we
don't
make
computers
and
we
don't
usually
come
up
with
computer
programs.
we
usually
simply
make
oil
seals,
shaft
seals,
rings
of
that
kind,
and
then
other
products
that
aren't
related
at
all
to
this
invention.
what
we're
interested
in
protecting
is
that.
we're
interested
in
being
able
to
keep
our
competitors
from
using
it
without
a
license
from
us.
we're
not
interest
at
all
in
protecting
the
program.
the
flow
sheets
that
the
government
contends
are
the
program
are...
well,
they
certainly
tell
a
lot
about
the
program,
they
enable
someone
to
use
it.
but
that's
going
to
be
printed
in
the
patent;
we
don't
care
if
it's
printed
in
the
newspapers.
we
don't
care
if
it's
distributed
to
everybody
in
our
business.
they
can
put
it
into
their
computers
if
they
want
to
as
long
as
they
don't
make
these
rubber
products.
the
case,
to
me,
is
an
important
one
from
the
stand-point
of
patent
law
because
up
until
a
short
time
ago
when
the
solicitor
made
his
statement
toward
the
end
of
his
argument,
i
believed
that
they
were
trying
to
say
that
the
use
of
a
computer
in
any
way,
or
program,
made
the
whole
process
unpatentable
no
matter
what
it
was.
i
found
out
he
doesn't
make
that
contention
and
i'm
very
much
relieved
by
it.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
he
does;
yes.
now,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i've
never
given
it
much
thought
whether
a
computer
program
is
patentable
because
computer
programs
are
so
long,
so
unwieldy,
that
i
just
can't
see
anybody
applying
for
a
patent
on
it.
that
may
not
be
the
thoughts
of
people
in
the
software
industry
but
i
don't
have
any
clients
in
that
field
myself.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
well,
that's
another
interesting
idea.
of
course,
that
wouldn't
protect
us
at
all.
we're
trying
to
protect
our
rubber
molding
product
and
you
can't
copyright
that
kind
of
thing.
that's
up
to
congress
right
now
and
i
hope
they
can
work
out
something
that
will
be
for
the
best
of
the
country,
whatever
it
is.
are
there
any
further
questions?
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i'm
really
basically
finished.
mr.
robert
e.
wickersham
i'll
be
happy
to
continue
if
you
want,
a
little
at
a
time.
thank
you,
then.
