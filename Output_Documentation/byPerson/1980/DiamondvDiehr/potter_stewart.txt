justice
stewart
but
this
is
a
machine
patent
in
the
terms
of
the
patent
law?
justice
stewart
to
flook.
justice
stewart
now,
in
flook
the
court
summarized
its
own
holding
by
saying,
very
simply,
"our
holding
today
is
that
a
claim
for
an
improved
method
of
calculation
even
when
tied
to
a
specific
end
use
is
unpatentable
subject
matter
under
section
101.
"
that's
the
way
the
court
itself
summarized
its
holding.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
that's
what
the
court
said
its
holding
was.
justice
stewart
well,
i
don't
see...
mr.
wallace,
i
didn't
understand
that
was
what
was
at
issue
in
flook
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
understood
it
that
way.
as
justice
stevens
has
suggested
by
his
question
this
morning,
what
flook
decided
was,
where
the
only
claim
of
the
applicant
for
a
patent
is
something
that's
just
a
better
method
of
calculating,
you
can
do
it
faster
on
a
computer
than
you
can
do
it
with
a
pencil
and
paper,
for
example,
then
that's
not
patentable
subject
matter
under
101.
despite
the
dissenting
opinion,
the
court's
opinion
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
interrelationship
of
101
and
102
and
103,
did
it
say
anything
about
it?
justice
stewart
i'm
not
the
best
one
in
the
world
to
say
what
flook
meant,
because
i
didn't
agree
with
it.
justice
stewart
well,
isn't
it
pretty
well
settled
that
the
scope
of
a
patent
is
to
be
measured
by
the
claims
of
the
applicant?
justice
stewart
the
prior
art
has
something
to
do
with
novelty
and
obviousness
and
things
like
that.
justice
stewart
well,
what,
mr.
wallace,
if
an
applicant
for
a
patent
said...
it's
a
machine
that
previously,
all
previous
machines
had
used
spring-wind,
spring-wound
mechanisms
to
open
a
gate,
say.
and
this
applicant
said,
the
difference
now
in
this
combination
is
that
i
use
gravity
to
do
it.
would
that
be
patentable
or
not?
justice
stewart
well,
would
it
be...
or
not?
justice
stewart
everything
else
is
the
same
but
i've
worked
out
a
way
to
use
gravity
to
do
this.
it
used
to
be
expensive
and
cumbersome--
justice
stewart
--the
difference
is,
it
uses
gravity
and
it
used
to
be
spring-actuated.
justice
stewart
all
for
the
same
purpose:
to
open
the
gate.
justice
stewart
would
that
be
patentable
or
not
under
your
argument?
justice
stewart
you're
using
it
very
effectively.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
an
indication
of
utility.
