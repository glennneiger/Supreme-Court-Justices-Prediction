mr.
wallace,
let
me...
since
you've
had
a
half-hour
of
argument
and
are
going
to
have
another
half
hour,
i
feel
more
at
liberty
to
interrupt
you
at
the
very
beginning.
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
did
of
your
opponent
in
the
prior
case,
do
you
think
the
patent
law
of
101
is
different
for
computers
than
it
is
for
other
patentable
objects?
justice
rehnquist
incidentally,
what
is
an
algorithm?
justice
rehnquist
the
word
has
a
much
broader
application.
justice
rehnquist
does
that
distinction
make
any
rational
sense
at
all,
to
say
that
a
known
scientific
principle
can
be
patented
but
an
unknown
one
can't
be?
justice
rehnquist
whether
it
was
described
as
a
machine
patent
or
a
process
patent?
justice
rehnquist
i
understand.
well,
don't
most
inventors
begin
their
inventing
work
trying
to
solve
a
particular
problem
rather
than
just
sitting
down
and
saying,
what
will
i
invent
today?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
gould
and
davis
patent
was
a
good
patent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
process
for
curing
synthetic
rubber
which
includes
in
several
of
its
steps
the
use
of
a
mathematical
formula
and
a
programmed
digital
computer
is
subject
matter
eligible
for
patent
protection
under
35
u.s.c.
section
101.
that
section
provides
for
the
issuance
of
patents
to
whoever
invents
or
discovers
any
new
or
useful
process,
machines,
manufacture
or
composition
of
matter
or
any
new
and
useful
improvement
thereof.
the
respondents
claim
to
have
invented
a
process
that
will
ensure
the
creation
of
a
perfectly
cured
rubber
product.
previously,
the
industry
have
been
unable
to
obtain
a
perfect
cure
because
it
could
not
precisely
measure
the
temperature
inside
the
molding
press,
thus
making
it
difficult
to
make
the
necessary
computations
to
determine
how
long
the
cure
should
take.
respondents
characterized
their
contribution
to
the
art
as
inhering
in
the
process
of
constantly
measuring
and
finding
the
temperature
inside
the
mold
and
feeding
these
temperature
measurements
into
a
computer
which
calculates
the
proper
cure
time
and
then
signals
the
device
to
open
the
press
at
the
completion
of
the
cure.
a
process
is
eligible
for
patent
protection
if
it
transforms
or
reduces
an
article
to
a
different
state
or
thing.
processes
for
curing
rubber
have
historically
been
eligible
for
patent
protection
and
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
respondents'
claim
involves
the
transformation
of
an
article
in
this
case
uncured
synthetic
rubber
into
a
different
state.
we
hope
the
respondents'
process
for
patent
protection
does
not
lose
its
eligibility
under
section
101
because
it
uses
as
a
mathematical
formula
and
a
program
digital
computer
and
several
of
its
steps.
while
a
mathematical
formula,
like
a
law
of
nature,
cannot
be
the
subject
of
a
patent.
respondents
do
not
seek
to
patent
a
mathematical
formula,
instead
they
seek
protection
for
a
complete
process
for
curing
synthetic
rubber
beginning
with
the
loading
of
a
mold
with
uncured
rubber
and
ending
with
the
opening
of
the
press
at
the
completion
of
the
cure.
a
claim
drawn
to
subject
matter
otherwise
statutory
does
not
become
nonstatutory
simply
because
it
uses
a
mathematical
formula,
computer
program
or
digital
computer.
respondents'
claims
must
be
considered
as
a
whole
because
we
do
not
view
their
claims
as
an
attempt
to
patent
a
mathematical
formula,
but
rather
to
be
drawn
to
an
industrial
process
for
the
molding
of
rubber
products.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
with
which
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun
joined.
