justice

mr.
wallace,
when
would...
when
could
you
get
a
patent
for
a
process
or
a
machine
that
as
one
of
its
elements
has
unpatentable
subject
matter
in
it?
you
don't
say
that
just
because
a
patent,
the
claims
of
a
patent
include
an
element
that's
unpatentable,
that
there's
no
patent?
justice
white
well,
what
if
there's
no
novelty--
justice
white
--well,
what
if
you
take
the
elements
apart
and
you
don't
find
any
novelty
in
any
one
claim
or
one
element
except
in
the
unpatentable
subject
matter,
but
there's
novelty
in
the
combination?
can
that--
justice
white
--you
don't
think
either
one...
here
you
say
there's
neither
novelty
in
any
other
element
nor
in
the
combination?
justice
white
it's
another
flook.
justice
white
well,
is
the
end
result
of
the
government's
position
that
no
computer
program
is
patentable?
that
isn't...
this
court
has
said
that--
justice
white
--has
so
far
said
that
it
wasn't
holding
that,
but
your
result
sounds
like
you
suggest
that
should
be
the
new
result.
justice
white
no,
but...
i
understand
that
but
you
are
now
answering
a
different
question
than
i
asked
you.
justice
white
nor
any
other
computer
program
that
you
can
think
of?
justice
white
well,
what's
new
about
your
process?
you
told
us
that
it's
an
old
idea
to
cure
this,
so
what's
the...
apparently
there's
some
novelty
in
the
use
of
the
computer
or
not?
justice
white
i
understand.
justice
white
using
the
computer?
justice
white
but
if
the
only
novel
element
in
here
was
the
use
of
the
computer?
justice
white
no,
you
certainly
wouldn't.
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
justice
white
suppose
the
claims
of
a
patent
clearly
encompass
some
unpatentable
subject
matter
and
it's
completely
agreed
that
that
unpatentable
subject
matter
is
a
discovery
in
the
sense
that
it's
new
and
novel,
but
didn't
flook
suggest
or
hold
that
if
that's
the
only
thing
new
or
novel
in
the
claims,
that
there
is
no
patentable
issue?
justice
white
well,
then,
mustn't
you,
if
you
find
an
unpatentable
element
in
the
claims,
mustn't
you
inquire
whether
there's
something
else
that
would
entitle
you
to
a
patent
in
the
claims?
justice
white
and
in
that
sense...
well,
in
that
sense,
then,
you
do
inquire
into
these
other
elements?
justice
white
well,
all
right,
but
don't
say
then
that
those
elements
are
wholly
foreign
under
flook.
justice
white
well,
it
may
be,
but
they--
justice
white
but
he
does
apparently
claim
that
no
computer
program
is
patentable.
