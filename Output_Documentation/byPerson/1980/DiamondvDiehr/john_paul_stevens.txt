justice
stevens
well,
before
you
sit
down,
let
me
just
ask
a
question
about
the
difference
between
this
case
and
flook.
flook
suggested
that
the
analysis
would
proceed
by
assuming
that
the
formula
was
in
the
prior
art
or
was
well
known
and
then
looking
for
something
else
that
was
claimed
to
have
been
discovered.
here
everybody
agrees
that
the
formula
for
figuring
out
how
long
to
cure
the
rubber
was
well
known.
the...
i
forget
the
name
of
the
formula...
but
that
was
well
known.
as
i
understand
it,
the
claim
is
that
it
was
a
new
idea
to
realize
that
a
computer
could
make
use
of
this
well-known
formula
when
it
was
attached
to
measuring
devices
within
the
oven
and
cause
this
desired
result
to
occur.
i
suppose
they're
claiming
that
discovery
of
the
fact
that
a
computer
and
the
appropriate
program
will
do
something
that
could
be
figured
out
before
is
itself
proper
ground
for
getting
a
patent,
which
is
a
little
bit
different
than
the
issue
in
flook.
justice
stevens
as
a
case
involving
the
creation
of
a
new
computer
program
to
implement
a
well-known
formula.
justice
stevens
that's
what
you'd--
justice
stevens
mr.
wickersham,
isn't
it
true
that
the
process
was
all
well
known
except
the
problem
of
knowing
when
to
stop
cooking?
when
to
open
the
oven?
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand
that,
but
what
the
recalculation
at
frequent
intervals
does
is
tell
you
the
precise
moment
when
you
should
discontinue
the
curing
process.
justice
stevens
which
in
effect
could
be
described
as
a
number,
because
it's
a
certain
number
of
minutes
or
seconds
from
the
time
you
started
the
cooking.
justice
stevens
they
didn't
in
parker
against
flook
either,
until
they
got...
they
kept
updating
it
and
it's
a
constantly
changing
number.
but
this
is
also
a
number
that
you
don't
know
of
until
you
get
there,
until
these
two
factors
coincide.
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
is
it
correct
that
if
you
had
all
the
monitoring
devices
and
they
transmitted
the
temperature
and
time
onto
a
screen,
constantly
changing
so
that
you
could
always
look
at
it,
and
you
had
a
mathematical
genius
who
could
do
this
formula
in
a
second
or
two,
you
wouldn't
need
the
computer?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
what
utility
is.
mr.
wickersham,
if
one
of
your
competitors
were
to
hire
the
mathematical
genius
i
described,
would
they
be
infringing?
justice
stevens
no,
and
you
make
the
assumption
that
flook
mandates,
namely,
that
the
mathematical
formula
is
one
to
be
assumed
to
be
well-known,
and
here,
in
fact,
it
was.
justice
stevens
--do
you
think
the
issues
in
these
two
cases
are
pretty
much
the
same,
or
different?
justice
stevens
yes--
justice
stevens
--you
want
to
patent
the
idea
of
using
that
program
or
one
like
it
to
figure
out
how
long
to
cook
the
rubber?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that's
really
unrelated
to
this
legislative
problem?
supposing
the
gould
patent
in
this
case
had
never
issued
but
was
just
applied
for,
and
it
had
whatever
claims
it
has
in
it
now,
13
or
14
claims.
and
there
was
a
claim
15
that
said
that
everything
in
the
preceding
claims
except
that
all
the
mathematical
calculations
shall
be
performed
by
means
of
a
digital
computer,
would
the
entire
patent
application
be
patentable
subject
matter,
and
or
if
all
but
the
last
claim
would,
would
the
last
claim
not
be
patentable
subject
matter
because
of
the
reference
i
include
in
it?
justice
stevens
what's
puzzling
about
this
case
is,
you
rely
on
the
earlier
patent
application
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
novelty
in
much
of
this
process,
but
they
argue,
they
come
back
and
say,
yes
but
that
does
demonstrate
that
the
process
is
patentable
subject
matter,
because
a
patent
issued
on
it.
and
the
only
thing
that's
happened
is,
they've
added
something
in
here.
does
that
destroy
what
would
otherwise
be
patentable
subject
matter
simply
because
they
say
you
can
do
a
lot
of
the
operations
in
the
process
by
having
the
mathematics
done
by
a
computer
instead
of
a
genius?
justice
stevens
and
what
you'd
say
to
my
hypothetical
is
that
last
claim
would
then
be
rejected
because
the
only
thing
that
was
additional
in
that
is
the
use
of
the
computer,
which
would
not
make
it
patentable?
