mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
case
is
factually
very
similar
to
parker
against
flook.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
it's
different
for
computers.
as
i
mentioned
in
the
last
case,
there
have
been
patents
issued
on
new
computer
machines.
this
case
cites
examples
of
patents
that
have
been
issued
on
processes
involving
the
use
of
a
computer
as
being
the
prior
art
that
anticipated
everything
claimed
in
this
process
other
than
the
algorithm,
the
new
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we've
talked
about
this
in
the
past.
the
court
defined
it
in
benson.
we
have
given
a
definition
in
our
brief
in
bradley
from
a
manual
on
computers.
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
computer
technology,
we
roughly
equate
it
to
a
computer
program,
because
it's
a
sequence
of
step-by-step
mathematical
sequences
to
be
performed
by
the
digital
computer.
of
course,
it
operates
only
in
a
mathematical
fashion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
a
broader
definition
in
webster's.
we've
attempted
some
in
our
brief
in
bradley,
to
state
that
we're
not
trying
to
use
the
word
in
an
all-embracing
fashion
which
would
extend
to
some
valid
process
patents,
as
we
understand
what
process
patents
are,
but
we're
confining
it
to
the
solution
of
a
sequence
of
mathematical
steps.
the
program
is
a
sequence
of
mathematical
steps,
which
is
the
only
thing
that
a
digital
computer
can
function,
with
respect
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
was
a
claim
on
a
composition
of
matter
rather
than
a
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
one
sense,
any
machine
or
any
composition
of
matter
is
a
process.
but
for
purposes
of
patent
law,
the
two
are
in
separate
categories.
scientifically,
it's
true
that
process
is
involved
in
any
of
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
true
in
the
preceding
case.
in
this,
the
present
case,
the
diehr
case
involves
a
process
claim.
it's
much
closer
in
form--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
flook,
and
differs
in
that
respect
from
chakrabarty.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
last
sentence
of
footnote
18
of
the
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
is
the
sentence
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
accepted
as
the
limit
of
the
holding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
understand
that.
what
we
regard
as
the
interpretation
of
section
101
that
i've
referred
to
in
flook
is
in
the
two
paragraphs
of
the
text
of
the
court's
opinion,
on
pages
593
and
594
of
that
volume.
and
that
is
the
portion
of
the
opinion
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
declined
to
follow
in
analyzing
subsequent
cases,
instead
relying
on
this
sentence
that
you
just
read,
mr.
justice,
from
a
footnote
in
the
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
aware
of
what
the
arguments
were
last
term
in
chakrabarty.
i
see
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion,
however,
that
really
has
much
bearing
on
the
issue
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
no
such
contention
before
the
court
in
the
present
case
by
any
party,
but
i
don't
see
that
there's
much
bearing
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
thought
what
we
were
arguing
is
that
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
101
in
flook
requires
an
inquiry
to
be
made
in
the
processing
of
patent
claims
to
see
whether
the
claim
of
novelty
inheres
in
a
scientific
principle,
formula,
or
other
aspect
of
what
this
court
has
referred
to
as
"the
basic
currency
of
technological
advance.
"
which
cannot
be
preempted
through
patent
claims.
and
what
was
at
issue
basically
in
flook,
as
we
understand
it,
was
whether
the
questions
of
novelty
and
obviousness
under
sections
102
and
103
would
be
the
only
possible
limitations
on
efforts
to
exclude
others
from
the
use
of
scientific
principles
and
mathematical
formulas.
and
if
those
were
related
to
end
uses
in
the
patent
claims
and
the
inquiries
under
102
and
103
showed
them
not
to
be
obvious
and
to
be
new,
then
others
could
be
excluded
from
using
those
scientific
principles
in
relation
to
those
particular
end
uses;
or
whether
section
101
precluded
claimants
from
trying
to
exclude
others
from
the
use
of
these
basic
elements
of
scientific
knowledge
even
though
they
have
novel
claims
to
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
did.
at
the
bottom
of
page
592
of
volume
437.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
specifically
addresses
this
question:
"respondent
argues
that
this
approach"...
namely,
the
court's
approach...
"improperly
imports
into
section
1
the
considerations
of
inventiveness
which
are
the
proper
concerns
of
sections
102
and
103.
"
"this
argument
is
based
on
two
fundamental
misconceptions.
"
then
the
succeeding
two
paragraphs
are
what
we
consider
to
be
the
heart
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
101
adopted
in
the
flook
case,
and
which
is
the
bone
of
contention
here.
unless
the
flook
holding
is
to
be
merely
a
guide
to
the
drafting
of
claims,
obviously
anyone
can
avoid
drafting
his
claim
so
that
the
only
thing
claimed
is
the
new
formula
or
new
scientific
principle,
and
the
board
of
patent
appeals,
in
order
to
make
the
holding
something
meaningful,
has,
we
think,
quite
rightly
construed
it
necessarily
to
mean
that
they
have
to
analyze
the
claims
to
see
whether
the
only
thing
that
is
novel
in
the
claims
is
the
scientific
principle,
formula,
or
other
fundamental
truth.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
do
measure
it
by
the
claims
but
they
analyze
the
claims
in
light
of
the
prior
art,
and
it's
all
part
of
the
examination
of
the
prior
art.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does.
the
patent
office
makes
the
inquiry
for
section
101,
102,
and
103
purposes
all
in
the
same
examination
of
prior
art.
but
even
if
there's
a
claim
to
a
novel,
unobvious
formula
or
scientific
truth
involved,
if
that's
the
only
novelty
that
inheres
in
the
claims
in
light
of
that
examination
of
prior
art,
then
it's
not
patentable
subject
matter
under
flook.
that
is
our
understanding
of
flook.
otherwise,
flook
becomes
nothing
but
a
guide
to
the
drafting
of
claims
and
scientific
principles
and
formulas
will
be
precluded
through
skillful
drafting
of
patent
claims.
the
reason
we
brought
flook
to
the
court
in
the
first
place
was
because
benson
had
left
this
question
unclear
and
had
gone
strictly
with
the
ccpa
on
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
of
course,
if
there's
novelty
other
than
novelty
in
the
scientific
principle
or
fundamental
truth,
then,
of
course,
it's
a
proper
claim
under
101--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
then
their
question
of
obviousness
and
so
forth
is
addressed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
can
be
novelty
in
a
combination
that
will
support
a
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
nor
in
the
combination.
the
finding
is
that
the
novelty
inhered
only
in
the
program
itself--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
sounds
to
me
as
if
it
might
not
be,
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
know--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--just
on
the
basis
of
that
hypothetical,
but
gravity
is
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
then
you
say
you've
worked
out
a
way,
if
that
way
is
something
different
from
the
previous
way--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
if
the
gravity
is
used
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
the
spring
action
and
there's
nothing
novel
except
the
use
of
the
scientific
principle
for--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
same
purpose
may
not
be
in
the
same
way.
seems
to
me
that
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
depend
on
the
answer
to
whether
it
was
being
used
in
the
same
way
as
the
spring.
if
it
were
it
would
not
be
patentable,
and
if
it
were
not,
it
would
be
patentable
subject
matter.
i
think
that
is
the
basic
meaning
of
flook,
that
there
has
to
be
some
novelty
other
than
a
novel
scientific
principle.
and
indeed,
there
can
be
a
valid
claim
under
section
101
even
if
the
scientific
principle
is
not
novel,
but
if
a
conventional
scientific
principle
is
used
in
a
novel
way.
the
court
recognized
that
in
the
opinion
of
flook.
it
happened
that
it
was
a
novel
scientific
principle
in
flook.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
isn't
the
principle
that
can
be
patented,
it's
only
the
new
use
of
it.
i
mean,
most
inventions
involve
new
use
of
familiar
substances,
principles,
or
ways
of
going
about
things,
where
it's
building
on
existing
technology.
the
effort
in
flook
was
to
prevent
the
patent
system
from
being
used
to
preempt
others
from
using
the
scientific
principles,
even
for
particular
end
uses.
and
that's
what
i
thought
was
the
prevailing
view
in
this
court
in
deciding
the
case
and
explaining
the
basis
for
its
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
our
position.
i
can't
really
be
responsible
for
what
other
writers
might
have
to
say
about
flook.
our
position
is
the
one
stated
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
course
of
our
argument,
that
flook
involved
an
interpretation
of
section
101
of
the
patent
laws
which
congress
is
free
to
change
if
congress
is
dissatisfied
with
it,
and
i
think
that
under
its
established
jurisprudence
the
members
of
this
court
should
adhere
to
that
interpretation
until
congress
sees
fit
to
change
it.
the
interpretation
is
laid
out
on
the
pages
of
the
united
states
reports.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
see
that
chakrabarty
undertook
to
repudiate
that
interpretation
of
section
101,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
understand
that
the
government
argued
for
a
contrary
result
in
chakrabarty,
but
i
think
that
the
result
reached
in
chakrabarty
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
court's
interpretation
of
section
101
in
flook--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
program's
been--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
refer
to
the
prior
art
here,
the
gould
and
davis
patent
referred
to
on
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
those
patents
described
a
similar
process
to
the
one
claimed
here
and
as
we
mention
on
page
9,
suggested
using
a
computer
device
to
determine
the
state
of
cure.
that
was
a
novel
process
on
which
a
patent
was
issued
and
there
are
many
novel
processes
involving
the
use
of
computers
on
which
patents
do
issue
and
patents
can
be
valid.
we're
not
saying
that
the
use
of
a
computer
in
a
process
means
that
the
process
is
not
a
patentable
process
under
101.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
computer
program
itself
would
not
be
patentable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
a
digital
computer,
that
is
correct,
because
it
involves
a
sequence
of
mathematical
steps.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
whether
the
program
was
described
either
way,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
computer
machines
are
patentable,
novel
machines.
and
indeed
the
coulter
machine
in
the
preceding
case
was
patented
and
is
the
basis
for
the
honeywell
computer
that's
being
manufactured.
the
question
is
whether
adding
a
program
to
it
results
in
another
patentable
machine,
which
in
effect
would
extend
the
life
of
the
patent
as
we
see
it.
i
don't
want
to
argue
the
preceding
case,
but
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
either
processes
or
machines
are
not
patentable
simply
because
computers
are
involved.
that's
a
distortion
of
our
position
that's
raised
by
some
of
the
amicus
briefs.
it
obviously
is
not
our
position.
i
think
i've
made
clear
our
understanding
of
what
the
court
accomplished
in
flook
and
the
reason
why
flook
was
here.
the
dissenting
opinion
in
flook,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
concluded
with
a
reference
to
a
number
of
pre-flook
decisions
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
interpreting
benson
and
referred
to
those
as
presenting
the
same
basic
issue.
in
looking
at
those
cases
again
and
comparing
them
with
the
present
opinion
and
other
post-flook
opinions
of
that
court,
the
striking
thing
to
us
is,
how
little
difference
there
is
in
the
analysis
approach
an
approach
being
used
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
prior
to
the
decision
in
flook
that
court
took
the
view
that
the
holding
in
benson
was
really
limited
to
an
effort
to
wholly
preempt
a
mathematical
formula.
the
same
basic
analysis
has
been
used
in
subsequent
cases,
although
the
court
does
recognize
that
under
flook
if
the
claim
is
on
the
mathematical
formula,
even
though
it
may
not
wholly
preempt
it
because
it's
limited
to
particular
end
uses
then
flook
does
have
to
control
that
kind
of
case.
but
the
kind
of
analysis
described
in
the
portions
of
the
court's
opinion
that
i've
referred
to
in
detail
here,
when
it's
used
by
the
board
of
appeals,
as
we
think
it
should
be
under
this
court's
decision,
has
been
criticized
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
they
have
really
limited
the
holding
to
those
two
basic
propositions,
that
if
the
claim
is
of
a
mathematical
formula
or
would
wholly
preempt
a
mathematical
formula,
then
those
decisions
would
preclude
the
granting
of
a
patent.
otherwise
the
analysis
should
proceed
the
way
it
did
in
the
pre-flook
cases.
and
that
is
what
we
seek
clarification
of
in
bringing
these
cases
here
today,
because
our
understanding
of
the
court's
interpretation
of
section
101
in
flook
and
what
we
were
asking
the
court
to
do
in
flook
is
quite
different
from
that.
and
the
way
the
patent
office
has
been
administering
flook
is
quite
different
from
that.
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
the
extent
that
was
the
claim,
the
davis
and
gould
application
referred
to
on
page
9
of
our
brief
had
described
the
use
of
a
computer
to
do
this
similar
thing.
and
what
the
board
found
here
to
be
the
contribution,
to
be
the
novel
thing,
was
the
devising
of
the
computer
program.
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
agreed
that
the
application
indeed
disclosed
a
computer
program.
the
board
found
that
to
be
the
only
contribution,
the
only
novel
thing
in
light
of
the
prior
art
in
this
application.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
refused
to
pass
on
that
question
because
it
thought
that
inquiry
was
beside
the
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes;
in
a
conventional
process.
it's
programming
a
computer
so
that
the
computer
can
be
used
in
a
conventional
process
to
implement
a
known
formula,
and
using
the
conventional
way
of
programming
a
digital
computer,
which
is
a
sequence
of
mathematical
steps.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'll
try
to
be
brief.
we
recognize
that
the
process
described
in
detail
in
respondents'
brief
and
described
during
the
oral
argument
is
a
useful
technological
process,
as
indeed
was
the
process
of
updating
the
alarm
limits
in
flook
for
the
purpose
of
producing
certain
petrochemicals
and
other
use
in
the
hydrocarbon
industry,
not
just
to
use
to
get
a
number,
after
all.
but
it
was
being
applied
to
the
manufacturing
processes
of
catalytic
conversion.
and,
indeed,
there
is
a
patent
on
basically
the
same
process
that
has
been
described
in
so
much
detail,
that
is
the
gould
and
davis
patent
which
was
cited
by
the
examiner
as
the
prior
art.
and
in
comparing
this
application
with
the
prior
art,
the
determination
was
made
that
what
was
disclosed
here
was
a
computer
program
and
that
everything
else
in
the
application
was
conventional,
was
known
in
the
prior
art,
was
the
familiar
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
no
reason
to
think
otherwise.
it
was
issued
by
the
patent
office.
it
has
not
been
challenged
in
infringement
litigation.
we
think
processes
of
this
kind
can
be
patentable.
it
probably
was
a
good
patent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
known;
that's
right.
whether
it
was
prior
art
doesn't
depend
on
whether
it
was
a
valid
patent.
it
was
prior
art.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
regardless
of
whatever
factual
contentions
are
made
here
about
whether
all
of
the
novelty
inhered
in
the
computer
program,
we've
tried
to
answer
those
in
our
brief.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
board,
not
disturbed
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
computer
programs
can
be
novel
and
not
obvious.
and
the
question
that
the
patent
office
has
been
faced
with,
the
question
that
was
before
this
court
in
benson
and
again
in
flook,
is
whether
there's
any
limitation
in
the
patent
law
on
awarding
the
patents
when
you
have
a
computer
program
or
other
sequence
of
mathematical
or
scientific
steps
that
is
novel
and
not
obvious,
and
there's
an
attempt
being
made
to
exclude
others
from
using
it,
perhaps
for
particular
end
uses.
and
i
want
to
remind
the
court
that
in
the
benson
case
the
court
quoted
from
the
president's
commission
on
the
patent
system,
which
said
that
the
programs
themselves
were
nor
statutory
subject
matter,
and,
then,
the
indirect
attempts
to
obtain
patents
by
drafting
claims
as
a
process
or
a
machine
or
components
thereof,
programmed
in
a
given
manner
rather
than
as
a
program
itself,
should
not
be
permitted.
and
the
reasons
why
that
commission
said
they
should
not
be
permitted
were
that
reliable
searches
would
not
be
feasible
or
economic
because
of
the
tremendous
volume
of
prior
art
being
generated.
without
this
search
the
patenting
of
programs
would
be
tantamount
to
mere
registration,
and
the
presumption
of
validity
would
be
all
but
nonexistent.
and
the
creation
of
programs
has
undergone
substantial
and
satisfactory
growth
in
the
absence
of
patent
protection
and
in
the
meantime
copyright
protection
for
programs
is
available.
that
is
the
legislative
question
that
this
court
has
twice
said
it
is
up
to
congress
to
address,
whether
in
whatever
form
and
effort
to
get
patents
on
processes
or
machines
where
the
only
element
of
novelty
is
in
the
computer
program
should
be
permissible,
as
long
as
those
programs
are
not
obvious
or
novel.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
mere
suggestion
of
the
use
of
a
digital
computer
would
not
make
the
application
unpatentable.
actually
they
did
suggest
the
use
of
a
digital
computer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
true
of
a
process
application
or
a
machine
application.
the
prior
art
shows
that
patents
do
issue
for
processes
and
for
machines,
and
if
flook
is
to
mean
anything,
it
must
be
more
than
a
guide
to
the
drafting
of
these
claims,
so
that
there's
always
a
claim
beyond
the
novel
formula
itself
in
the
application.
it
must
mean
that
the
application
is
analyzed
to
see
whether
the
only
novelty
inheres
in
the
scientific
principle
or
formula.
and
that
is
our
point,
in
bringing
these
cases
to
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
be
rejected
just
as
the
one
claim
in
morse
was
rejected,
that
the
court
referred
to
in
flook.
