did
chakrabarty
involve
a
process,
a
composition
of
matter?
chief
justice
burger
when
you
compose
disparate
elements,
is
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
government
thought
that
in
the
chakrabarty
arguments
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
hadn't
followed
flook
but
really
didn't
seem
to
have
the
credence
to
go
with
that.
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
about
the
statement
in
chakrabarty
that
"flook
did
not
announce
any
new
principle
that
inventions
in
areas
not
contemplated
by
congress
when
patent
laws
were
enacted
are
per
se
unpatentable?
"
chief
justice
burger
aren't
you
pretty
close
to
that,
your
argument?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
wallace,
there
are
some
writers
who
purport
to
be
authorities
on
the
subject
who
said
that
what
the
central
element
of
flook
was
that
when
the
courts
are
dealing
with
areas
not
foreseen
by
congress,
the
court
should
go
very
slowly
and
that
was
reiterated
in
chakrabarty.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
then
chakrabarty
was
a
dubious
holding
under
your
present
view?
