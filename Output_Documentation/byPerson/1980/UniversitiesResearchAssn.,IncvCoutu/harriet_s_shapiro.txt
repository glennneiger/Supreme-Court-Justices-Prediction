ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
suit
against
a
federal
contractor
based
solely
on
the
davis-bacon
act.
it's
not
a
suit
to
review
agency
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
an
administrative
procedure
act
suit
would
raise
different
issues
between
different
parties
and
require
the
consideration
of
different
fundamental
legislative
policies.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
neither
my
brief
nor
my
remarks
today
deal
with
the
issues
or
the
policies
that
would
have
to
be
considered
in
an
administrative
procedure
act
suit.
we've
taken
no
position
on
those
issues
and
i'm
not
authorized
to
speak
for
the
government
concerning
them.
the
question
here
is
only
whether
the
contractor
employee
has
a
right
to
relief
against
the
contractor
in
an
implied
private
cause
of
action
under
the
davis-bacon
act
itself.
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
reason
why
we
believe
that
under
the
cort
v.
ash
test
there
is
no
such
implied
cause
of
action.
and
we
have
emphasized
there
the
indications
of
legislative
intent
as
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
require.
this
morning,
however,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
third
cort
v.
ash
factor,
and
discuss
briefly
why
we
believe
that
the
implication
of
a
private
cause
of
action
is
not
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
legislative
purpose.
that
purpose
was
to
assure
the
payment
of
prevailing
wages
by
government
construction
contractors
without
disrupting
the
federal
procurement
process.
the
express
remedies
provided
are
the
result
of
the
congressional
balancing
of
these
potentially
competing
federal
interests.
the
remedies
are
designed
to
protect
the
laborer's
wages
without
interfering
unduly
with
efficient
procurement.
that
congressional
balancing
was
originally
made
in
the
1930s
when
government
procurement
contracts
were
far
simpler
than
the
one
before
the
court
in
this
case.
today
the
act
still
covers
the
traditional
brick-and-mortar
contracts.
it
also
covers
contracts
for
construction
that
is
necessary
for
the
highly
technical
federal
programs
at
the
department
of
energy
as
well
as
at
nasa
and
the
defense
department.
these
two
types
of
contracts
are
in
many
ways
quite
different
in
terms
both
of
the
need
of
the
laborers
for
the
additional
protections
that
a
private
cause
of
action
would
afford,
and
of
the
potential
of
such
a
cause
of
action
for
disrupting
procurement.
these
differences
simply
highlight
the
importance
of
maintaining
the
balance
congress
struck
in
an
earlier
day.
mr.
mann
has
described
briefly
how
the
fermilab
is
run
under
the
prime
contract
at
issue
here.
that
operation
is
typical
of
many
large,
long-term
federal
contracts
for
work
at
the
frontiers
of
science
and
technology.
i
want
to
add
to
his
description
only
the
statement...
at
the
fermilab
the
davis-bacon
decisions
are
made
by
a
committee
composed
of
agency
experts
and
if
the
decisions
that
the
private
work
projects
are
submitted
to
the
committee,
the
committee
makes
a
recommendation
as
to
whether
the
project
involves
davis-bacon
work
or
not.
if
the
committee
recommends
to
the
manager
and
the
contracting
officer
that
davis-bacon
work
is
involved,
that
work
is
subcontracted
out
to
a
contractor
who
works
under
the
davis-bacon
act,
with
the
davis-bacon
clauses
in
his
contract,
using
building
trades
union
employees.
the
operation
of
this
system
is
monitored.
the
agency
has
extensive
reviews
to
make
sure
that
the
contracts
for
construction
work
include
the
davis-bacon
clauses.
it
also
conducts
enforcement
investigations
at
the
site
to
make
sure
that
the
work
is
performed
as
required
by
the
contract
and
consistently
with
the
contract.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
in
your
hypothetical
the
provisions
are
in
the
contract?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
probably
not
in
the
federal
court.
it
would
be--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--he
would
have
an
action
on
his
contract.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
wouldn't
be
on
the
davis-bacon
act.
it
would
be...
well,
the
contract
would--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--he's
a
third-party
beneficiary
of
the
contract
that
was
written.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
correct?
he
also
has--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
but...
in
that
he
certainly
has
an
express
remedy
under
the
davis-bacon
act
too.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
like
the
miller
act
bond.
i
mean,
it's
the--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes,
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
and--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
that's
basically
one...
that's
what
we
thought
was
involved
in
the
mcdaniel
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
but--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--in
your
case
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
davis-bacon
act,
because--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
what
the
davis-bacon
act
requires
is
that
the
provisions
be
put
in
the
contract.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
gives
certain
remedies
that
are
available
but
the
contract...
i
mean--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--no,
i
mean,
where
he
has
under...
whatever
remedy
he
has
under
state
law
is
not
on
the
davis-bacon
act,
it's
on
the
contract
provisions
which
require
payment
of
the
wages
that
he
didn't
get.
mr.
mann
has
emphasized
the
difficulties
that
implication
of
a
private
cause
of
action
would
cause
for
government
procurement
from
the
contractor's
point
of
view.
there
are
also
problems
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
agency
that
is
using
these
highly
specialized,
expert
contractors
to
achieve
important
federal
goals.
the
interface
between
construction,
alteration,
and
repair
work
covered
by
davis-bacon
and
installation,
experimental,
or
maintenance
work
that
is
not
covered
will
often
be
very
hard
to
identify
under
prime
contracts
like
the
one
here.
moreover,
the
various
work
projects
must
be
closely
coordinated
and
labor
disputes
avoided.
for
all
these
reasons,
it
is
important
that
decisions
concerning
davis-bacon
coverage
be
made
by
people
who
are
very
familiar
with
the
technical
program
involved,
and
that
those
decisions
be
made
promptly,
with
finality,
and
consistently,
for
all
work
within
the
scope
of
the
contract.
the
possibility
of
a
court
acting
as
an
independent
decisionmaker
in
a
private
cause
of
action
threatens
the
effective
operation
of
this
system.
the
more
independent
decisionmakers
there
are
in
terms
of
number
of
district
courts,
courts
of
appeals,
the
harder--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
don't
believe--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes,
we
did.
our
position
in
mcdaniel
was
basically,
first,
the
7th
circuit's
opinion
was
somewhat
cloudy,
and
to
us
it
read
as
though
what
they
were
saying
was
that
they
believed
that
there
was
an
express
davis-bacon
clause
in
the
contract.
and
for
the
reasons
that
we
just
discussed
under
that
theory,
we
believe
that
the
7th
circuit
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
there
wasn't
1331
or
1337
jurisdiction,
but
that
there
would
be
a
contract
action
in
the
state
court.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
so
that,
on
that
theory...
and
we
didn't
think
that...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
decision--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--but,
the
petitioner
in
mcdaniel
had
not
raised
that
particular
question.
we
did
discuss
in
mcdaniel
the
reasons
why
we
thought
that
if
the
court
had
been
reaching
the
question
that
the
7th
circuit
clearly
reached
here
it
was
incorrect
because
of
the
application
of
the
cort
v.
ash
factors.
but
we
recommended
no
certiorari
because
we
just
didn't
think
that
case
was
a
clear
enough
case;
this
one
is.
my
final
point
is
that
at
least
in
the
particular
situation
that
we
have
here,
there
are
significant
nonjudicial
methods
for
the
laborer
to
assure,
to
be
sure
that
the
agency
is
not
acting
in
an
arbitrary
manner.
these
controls
are
non-judicial
but
the
fact
is
that
the
construction
trades
are
highly
unionized,
since
all
davis-bacon
work
is
required
to
be
performed
by
subcontract,
those
unions
have
a
real
interest
in
policing
the
agencies'
implementation
of
the
act,
so
that
their
employers
get
as
much
of
the
total
work
at
the
projects
as
possible.
and
they
have
ample
means
of
assuring
that
the
agency
will
consider
their
view
seriously.
these
basically
are,
negotiation
locally
in
washington
with
the
procuring
agency,
and
through
consultation
with
the
department
of
labor.
in
short,
particularly
in
the
context
of
contracts
like
this
one,
the
davis-bacon
act
is
effectively
enforced
through
negotiations
between
union
and
agency.
implication
of
a
private
cause
of
action
in
this
context
is
not
necessary
to
achieve
the
act's
purposes.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
the
time
for
petitioner.
