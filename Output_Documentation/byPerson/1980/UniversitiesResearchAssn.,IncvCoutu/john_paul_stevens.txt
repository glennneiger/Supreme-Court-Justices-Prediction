justice
stevens
mr.
mann,
could
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
assume
here
there
had
been
a
predetermination
that
some
part
of
the
construction
work
on
the
laboratory
would
be
covered
by
davis-bacon.
and
the
laboratory
did
not
pay
those...
and
it
was
performed
by
their
own
people.
and
supposing
an
employee
didn't
know
about
that
till
the
contract
was
performed
and
then
he
had
gotten
less
than
the
davis-bacon
act
provided,
would
he
have
in
your
view
of
the
law,
have
a
private
cause
of
action
against
your
client
for
the
difference
between
what
he
was
paid
and
what
he
actually
should
have
been
paid?
justice
stevens
did
you
take
that
position
in
the
7th
circuit?
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
raise
that
in
the
7th
circuit?
justice
stevens
or
in
the
trial
court?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
the
distinction
between
predetermination
and
postdetermination,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
a
different
question
than
the
question
whether
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
and
it
seemed
to
me
in
your
brief
the
issue
was
rather
clear,
that
you
basically
were
arguing
about
whether
they
decided
in
advance
of
performance
of
the
contract
there
was
any
davis-bacon
act
work
and
you
said,
no,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
that
doesn't
require
us
to
think
at
all
about
private
cause
of
action,
as
i
see
it.
justice
stevens
but
would
you
say
the
contracting
agency
could,
after
the
contract
was
performed,
come
in
and
say,
we'd
like
to
make
a
new,
a
postcontract
coverage
determination?
justice
stevens
well,
if
they
assume
the
responsibility
for
paying
the
difference,
i
suppose
anybody
could
do
that.
justice
stevens
but
assuming
they're
saying,
no.
we
paid
you
the
contract
amount
and
we
just
now
realized
we
should
have
made
a
davis-bacon
act
determination.
we
failed
to
do
it.
they
can't
do
that
either,
can
they,
in
your
view
of
the
law?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
it's
the
same
whether
the
government
were
the
plaintiff
or
the
employee
was
the
plaintiff?
justice
stevens
so
the
private
cause
of
action
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
red
herring
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
well,
if
he's
just
saying,
i
want
an
amendment.
but
if
his
theory
is,
it
clearly
says
it's
davis-bacon
act
work,
i
provided
it
and
the
contract
provided
for
it,
you're
saying,
well,
he
could
sue
in
the
state
court.
justice
stevens
so
the
public
policy
in
the
private
cause
of
action
issue
is
just
a
question
of
where
he
sues.
justice
stevens
mrs.
shapiro,
in
a
case
such
as
you're
describing
where
there
is
a
clear
determination
that
the
davis-bacon
act
is
to
be
performed
and
to
be
paid
for
at
the
regular
rates,
assume
there
was
a
slip-up
and
for
some
reason
an
employee
did
not
get
paid
the
amount
required
by
the
statute
and
by
the
predetermination
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
for
some
reason
the
government
missed
it
in
its
review
and
paid
out
the
contract.
would
the
employee
in
your
view
have
a
cause
of
action
against
his
employer
for
the
difference
between
what
he
was
paid
and
what
he
should
have
been
paid?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
he
would
only
be...
in
the
federal
court
he'd
have
such
a
cause
of
action?
justice
stevens
why
not
in
a
federal?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
he
didn't
have
a
contract
with
the
employer,
but
he
had
a
contract
for
a
lesser
amount
with
the
employer.
justice
stevens
and
in
your
view
he'd
have
the
remedy
but
would
be
confined
to
the
state
court?
justice
stevens
so
you
ask
us
basically
to
overrule--
--unless
there's
diversity
jurisdiction
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
yes,
and
there's
no
federal
remedy
for
violation--
justice
stevens
--well,
if
he
has
a
remedy...
does
he
have
a
remedy?
justice
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
a
case
where
there
was
a
slipup
and
they
paid
out,
and
the
bond
was
discharged.
justice
stevens
and
sometime
later
he
then
could
sue
his
employer
but
you'd
say,
just
as
a
matter
of
third-party
beneficiary
of
a
contract,
but
he
has
no
federally
protected
rights.
justice
stevens
that's
the
government's
position?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
he
was
still
within
the
cort
v.
ash
test
of
a
person
who
was
specifically
intended
to
be
the
specific
beneficiary
of
the
statute
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
if
the
likelihood
of
a
slip-up
is
so
remote
that
he
wouldn't--
justice
stevens
--well,
he
wasn't
paid
as
the--
justice
stevens
--the
act
does
not
require
that
the
contract
be
performed
in
accordance
with
the
law?
justice
stevens
well,
then
he
shouldn't
even
have
a
remedy
under
state
law,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
because
the
law,
as
you
said,
has
been
complied
with.
the
government
just
slipped
up.
justice
stevens
mrs.
shapiro,
can
i
just
refresh
my
recollection?
the
government
took
a
contrary
position
when
it
filed
its
memorandum
in
connection
with
the
sur-petition
in
mcdaniel,
did
they
not,
on
the
private
cause
of
action
issue?
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens
you
took
the
position
in
that
case
that
the
7th
circuit
was
wrong?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
your
view
then
was
there
was
never
any
federal
implied
cause
of
action
under
any
circumstances?
justice
stevens
do
you
rely
on
paragraph
33,
is
that
the
paragraph
you
rely
on
for
that,
or
is
it
a
different
paragraph?
justice
stevens
but
don't
you
run
into
the
same
problem
justice
stewart
just
identified,
though,
the
very
fact
that
it
was
not
subsequently
modified
tends
to
indicate
that
the
two
parties
agreed
that
no
davis-bacon
act
work
had
been
performed?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
nye,
just
sticking
with
that
for
just
a
second,
is
it
not
true
that
if
that
happened
the
way
you
describe,
the
government
had
a
duty
not
to
pay
the
contract
price
until
they
were
satisfied
that
the
employees
had
been
paid
the
appropriate
wages,
isn't
that
true?
justice
stevens
well,
is
it
not
true
as
a
sort
of
a
general
proposition
that
the
government
has
a
duty
not
to
pay
out
in
full
on
the
contract
until
it's
satisfied
that
there's
been
no
violation
of
the
davis-bacon
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question
in
response
to
something
mr.
nye
had
said?
if
those
letters
that
are
referred
to
in
the
appendix...
and
very
honestly,
i
don't
have
them
in
mind...
if
they
do
unambiguously
state
that,
if
employees
of
the
contractor
do
perform
any
davis-bacon
work,
then
they
shall
be
paid
at
davis-bacon
rates,
if
they
so
provide,
then
do
you
have
a
duty
to
pay
at
the
rate
he
claims?
