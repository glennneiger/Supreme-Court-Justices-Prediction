justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
statute
called
the
davis-bacon
act
provides
that
advertised
specifications
for
federal
construction
contracts
shall
contain
a
provision
stating
the
minimum
wages
to
be
paid.
those
wages
must
be
based
on
what
the
secretary
of
labor
determines
to
be
prevailing
in
the
locality.
the
act
further
provides
that
every
contract
based
on
such
specifications
shall
contain
a
stipulation
that
the
contractor
will
pay
wages
not
less
than
those
stated
in
the
specifications.
the
petitioner,
universities
research
association,
made
a
contract
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
provide
scientific
and
management
services
to
the
united
states
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
a
fermi
national
accelerator
laboratory,
a
high-energy
physics
research
facility.
it
was
administratively
determined
however,
not
to
call
for
work
subject
to
the
davis-bacon
act
and
the
contract
therefore,
contained
no
prevailing
wage
stipulation.
respondent,
a
former
employee
of
the
petitioner,
brought
suit
behalf
of
himself
and
others
seeking
damages
on
the
theory
that
the
petitioner
had
violated
the
act
by
failing
to
pay
prevailing
wages
for
the
construction
work.
the
federal
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
the
petitioner
or
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
however
reversed.
it
held
that
if
the
petitioner
actually
performed
davis-bacon
act
work
with
its
own
employees,
the
respondent
became
entitled
to
the
prevailing
wages
and
it
remanded
the
case
so
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
if
it
could.
that
petitioner
had
used
him
in
his
class
to
perform
davis-bacon
act
work.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
act
does
not
confer
upon
an
employee
a
private
right
of
action
for
back
wages
under
a
contract
that
has
been
administratively
determined
not
to
call
for
work
subject
to
the
act.
we
find
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
authorize
such
a
suit
that
the
act's
legislative
history
supports
this
conclusion
and
that
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
also
points
in
this
direction.
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
under
a
contract
that
does
not
contain
prevailing
wage
stipulations
would
destroy
the
careful
balance
the
act
strikes
between
the
interest
of
contractors
and
those
of
their
employees.
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
also
would
introduce
substantial
uncertainty
and
the
government
contracting
and
would
undercut
the
elaborated
administrative
scheme
that
has
been
promulgated
to
assure
consistency
in
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
the
act.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
