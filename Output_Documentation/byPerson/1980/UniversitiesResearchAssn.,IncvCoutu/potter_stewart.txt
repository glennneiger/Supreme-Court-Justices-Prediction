justice

and
that
was
in
the
mcdaniel
case
by
hypothesis,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
so,
if
there
is
no...
so,
in
other
words,
the
question
addressed
in
part
ii
of
your
brief
is
the
threshold
question,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
right.
if
the
answer
to
that
is,
no,
there's
no
private
cause
of
action
at
least
in
the
federal
courts.
then
that's
the
end
of
this
case,
without
getting
into
matter
addressed
in
part
i
of
your
brief.
justice
stewart
if
there's
no
private
right
of
action
in
federal
district
court,
that's
the
end
of
that
case.
justice
stewart
well,
that
"long
list
of
stipulations",
as
you
call
it,
is
required
by
the
davis-bacon
act,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
and
therefore
its
absence
indicates
that
the
parties
determined
that
the
davis-bacon
act
is
inapplicable.
justice
stewart
i
see.
mr.
nye,
in
this
connection,
earlier,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
contract
has
a
provision
that
says
if
this
eventuality
comes
to
pass
then
they
shall
be
paid
at
davis-bacon
rates.
justice
stewart
i
thought,
rather,
that
the
specific
question
exposed
by
my
brother
white
was
one
that
the
government
took
no
position
on?
but
wouldn't
it
be
very
odd
to
say
it's
subject
to
a
judicial
review
but
that
this
case
must
be
dismissed,
because
where
there
is
no
agency
determination
at
all--
