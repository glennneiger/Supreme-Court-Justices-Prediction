justice

--that
was
available
then?
justice
white
i
know.
but
there
was
one,
wasn't
there,
prior
to
the
contract
issuance?
justice
white
after...
i
know,
after
the
contract
issued.
justice
white
well,
how
about
before?
justice
white
so,
any
time
the
agency
issues
a
contract
and
has
made
a
determination
that
there
is
no
coverage,
that
it
isn't
covered,
i
suppose
you
would...
the
contract
would
issue
and
there
wouldn't
be
a
surety
bond,
and
in
any
of
those
circumstances
if
you
allege
that
the
agency
mistakenly
decided
that
there
was
no
coverage,
you
would
have...
you
should
be
able
to
have
the
court
redetermine
coverage.
justice
white
yes.
well,
that's
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
white
oh.
justice
white
i
know,
but
they
didn't...
but
they
didn't
provide
for
it.
justice
white
i
take
it
that
the
heart
of
the
government's
submission
is
that
the
agency
determination
of
coverage
is
just
unreviewable?
justice
white
i
know
that,
but
don't
you
understand
the
government
to
assert
what
i
say?
justice
white
and
that
if
the
agency
makes
a
determination
before
contracting
and
that
is
subject
to
appeal,
i
suppose,
to
the
department
of
labor,
but
the
department
of
labor's
decision
may
or
may
not
bind
the
agency.
but
in
any
event
the
government's
submission
is
that
those
determinations
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
white
--or
where
there
wasn't...
at
least,
where
there's
no
administrative
remedy
now?
