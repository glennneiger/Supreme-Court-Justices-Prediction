justice
rehnquist
in
this
case
there
never
would
have
been
a
lawsuit
had
not
a
private
individual
claiming
a
private
cause
of
action
under
the
davis-bacon
act
brought
it,
would
there?
justice
rehnquist
why'd
you
sue
in
federal
court
rather
that
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
that
refers
to
the
miller
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
that
may
be,
but
it
would
not
seem
to
me
to
necessarily
follow
that
because
the
employer
hasn't
provided
a
bond
which
congress
has
required
him
to
file,
that
gives
an
employee
a
private
right
of
action
in
a
federal
court.
justice
rehnquist
we
granted
certiorari
here
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
7th
circuit.
justice
rehnquist
did
they
say
in
so
many
words
that
an
employee
shall
have
a
private
right
of
action
against
an
employer
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
davis-bacon
act?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean...
certainly;
you're
a
lawyer,
i
was
a
lawyer
and
like
to
think
of
myself
as
still
being
one.
one
could
point
to
a
section
that
says,
either
an
employee
shall
have
a
cause
of
an
action
in
united
states
district
court
in
the
jurisdiction
where
he
performs
the
labor.
you
have
to
admit
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
rehnquist
where?
justice
rehnquist
give
me
the
exact
language
of
section
3(b)
as
you
rely
on
it.
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
refers
to...
that
refers
back
to
the
right
of
action
conferred
by
law
upon
persons
furnishing
labor
or
material.
it's
derivative.
justice
rehnquist
but
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
a
contractor
went
into
bankruptcy,
the
miller
act
funds
were
exhausted,
and
even
given
the
wage
priority,
your
clients
simply
couldn't
recover?
justice
rehnquist
--but
that
isn't
the
same
question
as
saying
where
they
have
a
right
to
sue
on
those
contracts.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
reply
brief
at
pages
14
and
15,
as
to
his
account
of
how
he
claims
to
have
raised
it
in
the
7th
circuit
treatment
of
mcdaniel
i,
mcdaniel
ii?
do
you
say...
you
have
not
had
a
chance
to
reply
to
that.
is
he
simply
being
factually
inaccurate?
justice
rehnquist
well,
no,
don't--
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
nye,
considering
the
fact
that
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction,
on
what
jurisdictional
section
of
the
title
28
do
you
rely
for
being
in
court
here?
