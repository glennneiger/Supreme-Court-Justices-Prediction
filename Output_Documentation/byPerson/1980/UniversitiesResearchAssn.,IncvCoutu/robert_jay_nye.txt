mr.
robert
jay
nye
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
on
that
last
point
about
sufficient
nonjudicial
controls
to
be
sure
that
the
davis-bacon
act
will
be
implemented
and
applied
by
reason
of
negotiations
between
unions
and
agencies,
i
wish
to
advise
the
court
if
the
court
does
not
already
know
that
i
represent
an
individual
and
a
class
of
individuals.
i
do
not
represent
a
union.
i
am
here
representing
wage
earners
who
have
been
requested
by
their
employer,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
to
do
certain
work
which
manifestly
is
under
a
davis-bacon
act
contract.
it
says,
"for
construction,
alteration,
repair.
"
and
everything
else
that
the
davis-bacon
act
requires.
these
people
did
perform
that
work,
we
are
not
at
the
stage
yet
in
this
case
where
it
can
be
said
to
this
court
that
they
did
not...
this
case
arose
on
a
summary
judgment,
just
on
a
legal
issue.
they
performed
that
work
and
they
were
not
paid
the
prevailing
wages
required
by
the
davis-bacon
act
and
established
by
the
secretary
of
labor's
predeterminations
of
wages.
now,
on
that
predetermination
point--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--because,
your
honor,
we
have
a
federal
right
of
action.
number
one,
because,
number
one,
the
statute
gives
it
to
us.
section
3(b)
of
the
statute
says...
and
this
court
in
its
binghamton
decision
refers
to
that
as
being
an
employee
right
of
action
against
his
contractor.
that
statute
reads:
"the
right
of
action
and/or
of
intervention
against
the
contractor
and
his
sureties
conferred
by
law
upon
pertinent
persons
furnishing
labor
or
materials.
"
mr.
robert
jay
nye
well,
if
it
does,
your
honor,
and
if
it
is
to
be
so
construed,
it
was
not
so
construed
in
the
binghamton
case,
but
of
course
that
case
did
not
involve
the
question.
if
it
is
to
be
construed
as
being
only
an
action
on
a
surety
payment
bond...
it
doesn't
talk
about
the
miller
act
bond,
but
on
a
surety
payment
bond,
then
we
have
the
anomaly
in
this
case
of
the
contractor
failing
to
furnish
the
surety
payment
bond
that
congress
requires
with
respect
to
construction
contracts,
and
therefore
the
employes
again
are
placed
in
a
position
of
not
being
able
to
sue.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
if
the
court
please,
the
question,
as
the
7th
circuit
has
said
in
the
mcdaniel
cases,
is
not
the
existence
of
a
private
right
of
action.
congress
intended
a
private
right
of
action.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
yes,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
that,
and
i
understand
that.
and
i
am
submitting
to
the
court
that
congress
has
created
in
favor
of
employees
a
private
right
of
action.
they
intended
one
where
they
cannot--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--in
my
interpretation
of
that
language--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--i
say...
i
must
take
two
positions,
your
honor.
i
say
it
does--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--grant
the
employee
that
right
of
action.
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
may
be
on
a
payment
surety
bond,
the
surety
bond,
after
all,
is
simply
security
to
assure
payment
of
an
obligation.
when
the
congress
talks
about
the
right
of
action
given
to
an
employee
in
section
3(b)
of
this
act,
they
have
given
a
right
of
action
to
that
employee.
they
have
assured
to
him
a
private
remedy
in
the
event
that
none
of
the
other
remedies
are
available.
and
in
this
case,
none
of
the
other
remedies
are
available.
the
government
did
not--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--i
am
quoting
it.
i
have
that
language
itself...
the
employee
shall
have
"the
right
of
action
and/or
of
intervention
against
the
contractors
and
their
sureties
conferred
by
law
upon
persons
furnishing
labor
or
materials.
"
now,
that
is
the
statute
and
that
with
reference--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--well,
that
may
be
the
decision
of
this
court.
it
has
been
the
decision
of
the
7th
circuit,
that
may
also
be
the
decision
of
this
court.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
does
refer
back
to
some
payment
bond
that
is
required
and
that
payment
bond
does
not
exist,
i
am
saying,
because
congress
intended
a
right
of
action,
this
court
must
recognize
that
there
is
by
implication,
at
least,
some
remedy
when
this
statutory
remedy
is
rendered
ineffective
and
unavailable
to
the
employees,
certainly
through
no
fault
of
the
employees
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
if
they
can't
recover,
they
can't
recover,
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
funds.
if
the
employer
is
bankrupt
and
there
are
no
funds
available
from
an
estate,
from
a
bankrupt
estate
with
which
to
to
pay
the
employees,
they
cannot
recover.
but
that's
whether
or
not
the
remedy
is
worthwhile,
whether
or
not
there
will
actually
be
recovery
on
a
remedy.
that's
not
the
existence
of
the
remedy
itself.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
the
1964
amendments
to
my
recollection,
your
honor,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
the
right
of
action.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
representative
goodell
in
his
attempt
to
place
an
amendment
in
the
act,
which
did
not
pass,
sought
to
open
up
the
entire
area
of
judicial
review
concerning
all
aspects
of
the
act,
at
least
according
to
his
proposed
bill,
his
proposed
amendments.
however,
other
statements
by
legislators,
for
example,
representative
fogarty
and
others,
and
representative
goodell
himself,
recognized
that
the
basic
purpose
of
that
proposed
amendment
by
that
representative,
was
to
render
the
secretary
of
labor's
predeterminations
of
prevailing
wages,
what
the
prevailing
wages
in
a
community
are,
subject
to
judicial
review.
and
because
the
congress
has
always
determined
that
that
question
should
not
be
open
to
judicial
review
as
well
as
for
other
nongermane
reasons,
congress
did
not
adopt
that
view.
congress
did
not,
therefore,
open
up
the
question
of
predeterminations
of
wage
rates,
what
they
are
in
a
community,
to
judicial
review.
but
the
question
of
predetermination
of
anything
else
has
never
been
an
issue
in
the
act.
that
has
never
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
any
government
agency,
one
way
or
another.
counsel
attempts
to
use
the
word
predetermination
in
a
very
broad
way,
and
the
davis-bacon
act
is
a
very
simple
statute.
it
says
that
the
secretary
of
labor
shall
make
predeterminations
of
wage
rates,
and
he
does,
and
they
are
published
in
the
federal
register
for
each
county
and
metropolitan
area
around
the
country,
and
that's
all
that
he
is
supposed
to
predetermine.
now,
what
the
petitioner
seeks
to
say,
that
there
should
be
and
must
be,
in
order
for
the
davis-bacon
act
to
work,
there
must
be
a
predetermination
by
a
government
agency
that
a
contract
is
a
construction
contract.
well,
the
solicitor
of
labor
in
his
testimony
in
1962,
among
others,
has
said
that
when
congress
enacted
the
davis-bacon
act
in
1931
and
amended
it
substantially
in
1935,
congress
did
not
use
the
words
"construction,
alteration,
or
repair,
including
painting
and
decorating.
"
to
mean
something
special,
or
something
that
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
some
technicians
at
some
government
agency,
or
something
difficult
of
interpretation.
the
solicitor
of
labor
at
that
time
and
all
of
the
authorities
who
have
referred
to
it
have
talked
about
the
fact
that
congress
meant
the
ordinary
meaning
of
those
words,
and
courts
can
make
those
determinations.
we
have
cited
the
recent
cortelyou
of
one
of
our
circuits
in
which
the
court
held
specifically,
very
recently,
that
the
work
that
was
before
it
clearly
was
pursuant
to
a
contract
calling
for
"construction,
alteration,
or
repair,
including
painting
or
decorating.
"
now,
i
have
asserted
in
my
brief
that
the
right
of
action
question
was
never
briefed,
argued,
or
whatever,
before
the
lower
courts.
this
summary
judgment
matter
arose
when
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
discovery
at
that
time,
by
the
way,
was
stayed
to
permit
the
court
to
rule
on
that
legal
question.
that
summary
judgment
motion
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
of
petitioner's
counsel
saying,
"no
davis-bacon
act
stipulations
have
been
included
within
or
are
incorporated
within
the
government
contract
here
in
question.
"
i
am
paraphrasing
a
bit
there.
but
that's
the
issue,
that's
the
issue
that
was
raised
before
the
trial
court,
that
is
the...
this
contract
does
not
contain
davis-bacon
act
stipulations,
that
was
the
issue
raised
before
the
trial
court
and
that
was
the
issue
argued
and
dealt
with
in
the
7th
circuit.
there
was
no
right
of
action
issue
at
that
time.
and
the
7th
circuit
said,
and
i
respectfully
submit,
correctly...
and
indeed
it
must
be
so
held...
that
a
statute
that
is
a
mandatory
statute,
a
statute
that
says
that
certain
things
shall
occur
is
incorporated
by
operation
of
law
if
it
is
not
within
a
contract
in
itself,
or
if
it
is
there
by
reference
if
it
is
referred
to
by
the
parties.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
also,
that
the
davis-bacon
act
is
expressly
within
our
contract,
notwithstanding
the
summary
judgment
granted
by
the
trial
court,
because
among
other
things
this
is...
the
fact
that
davis-bacon
was
referred
to
in
correspondence
between
the
aec
at
that
time
and
our
petitioner.
the
requirement
on
the
petitioner
is
that
such
construction
work
which
is
called
for
by
this
contract
would
be
subcontracted
to
subcontractors
with
the
petitioner
having
the
obligation
to
make
sure
that
davis-bacon
stipulations
were
included
in
all
those
subcontracts.
and
there
was
the
further
agreement
between
them
by
memorandum
which
we
were
able
to
discover...
by
the
way,
through
freedom
of
information
act
procedures,
not
through
the
discovery
that
we
were
able
to
get
by
that
time...
there
was
the
further
memorandum
of
understanding
that
if
the
petitioner
does
any
of
this
work
with
its
own
employees...
that's
our
case...
its
own
employees,
then
the
contract
will
be
modified.
the
general
contract,
this
prime
contract,
will
be
modified
to
require
that
the
petitioner
pay
its
own
employees
the
prevailing
wages
required
by
the
davis-bacon
act.
how
can
anybody
say
that
the
davis-bacon
act
is
not
express
in
that
contract?
and
even
if
it
isn't,
even
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
davis-bacon
act
is
not
referred
to
in
that
contract
and
that
they
are
not
bound
by
express
contract,
they
are
certainly
bound
by
the
principle
that
mandatory
statutes
which
affect
government
contracts
are
in
those
contracts
by
operation
of
law.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
that's
a
separate
question.
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
was
never
raised
below,
and
i
raise
that
here.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
well,
if
i
may
examine
that?
mr.
robert
jay
nye
he
did
not
raise
it,
it
was
not
dealt
with
in
that.
you
can
look
at
his
briefs,
in
his
briefs
in
that
court.
his
brief
in
that
court
does
not
talk
about
the
right
of
action;
indeed,
does
not
go
into
that
question
at
all.
he
was
placing
all
of
his
reliance
on
the
question
of
contract
interpretation.
and
that
was
all
that
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals,
except
for
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
points.
but
on
this
contract
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
my
clients,
these
wage
earners,
should
have
exhausted
whatever
administrative
remedies
there
might
be
before
going
to
the
federal
courts.
and
at
that
time
the
7th
circuit
mentioned
the
petitioner
has
not
suggested
any
such
administrative
remedy,
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
find
one.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
or
is
available
today,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
no,
your
honor.
the
government
in
their
briefs,
in
this
case,
in
their
amicus
brief,
has
mentioned
that
there
is
no
administrative
remedy
available
to
a
wage
earner
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
that's
right.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
he
was
not
a
wage
earner
for
this
petitioner
before,
your
honor.
he
didn't
know
that
he
was
going
to
be
working
for
these
people.
there
was
no
way.
there
was
no
way,
absolutely,
for
this
wage
earner
or
his
class
members,
not
having
been
employed,
not
knowing
whether
they
would
ever
be
employed,
not
knowing
that
the
government
was
going
to
contract
with
universities
research
associates,
that
there
was
any
issue
to
be
raised.
they
didn't...
they
have
no
interest
in
it.
their
interest
developed
when
they
became
employed
and
when
it
was
determined
by
them...
and
of
course
this
is
postcontracting...
that
they
were
not
being
paid
the
proper
minimum
wages.
and
as
to
that,
the
government
agrees,
there
is
no
administrative
remedy.
indeed,
in
the
1962
hearings
before
congress
concerning
the
administration
of
the
davis-bacon
act...
it
is
very
interesting
to
read
these;
i've
cited
them
in
my
brief.
the
representatives
of
the
comptroller
general's
office
has
said,
there
are,
there
is
no
agreement
among
the
agencies
as
to
who
has
what
kinds
of
enforcement
powers.
and
the
comptroller
general
also
says,
the
secretary
of
labor
believes
he
does,
we
believe
we
do.
and
then
the
secretary
of
labor's
representative
said
the
same
thing,
there
is
no
agreement;
we
believe
we
do,
and
they
believe
they
do.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
section
1337,
your
honor,
a
civil
action,
a
civil
case
arising
under
any
statute,
any
federal
statute
affecting
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
one
of
the
powers
exercised
by
congress
in
enacting
the
davis-bacon
act.
that
is
the
jurisdictional
prerequisite,
the
right
of
action
is
referred
to
by
congress.
to
the
extent
that
this
court
elects
to
determine
the
question
of
the
existence
of
a
right
of
action,
i
should
point
out
that
i'm
not
asking
this
court
nor
have
i
ever
asked
that
this
court
or
any
court
in
this
case
consider
that
there
is
an
alternative
private
remedy
to
an
employee
which
he
can
voluntarily
use
and
disregard
any
other
private
remedy
that
congress
may
have
given
him,
such
as
that
one
under
section
3(b),
talking
about
the
right
of
action
against
the
contractor
and
his
sureties,
which
congress
has
given
to
him.
i
have
not
said
that
a
wage
earner
has
the
right
to
disregard
express
remedies.
i
have
said,
if
an
alternative
is
required,
if
that
statute,
if
that
section
is
interpreted
as
meaning
only
action
under
some
payment
bond,
then
there
must
be...
since
congress
intended...
a
right
of
these
individuals
to
recover
their
unpaid
wages,
for
these
individuals
to
have
a
right
of
action
directly
against
the
contractor,
but
only
if
the
original
statutory
remedies
are
unavailable,
and
ineffective
in
the
ways
that
they
are
in
this
case.
now,
i
should
be
very
frank
with
this
court
to
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
thus
far
to
demonstrate
that
the
remedies
are
unavailable
or
ineffective
in
this
case.
that
was
shown
in
the
mcdaniel
case
because
that
was
in
issue,
and
we
presented
affidavits
below
in
the
trial
court
demonstrating
that
the
employer...
that
was
university
of
chicago
operating
argonne
national
lab...
had
not
furnished
the
necessary
surety
payment
bond
and
that
the
comptroller
general
had
not
withheld
certain
payments
in
order
to
pay
employees,
as
well
as
a
couple
of
other
miscellaneous
items
like
blacklisting,
which
of
course
would
not
be
done
in
this
kind
of
an
instance,
and
one
other
minor
administrative
item.
there
we
made
our
record.
here
we
never
had
a
record,
had
an
opportunity
to
make
the
record
concerning
the
unavailability
or
ineffectiveness
of
this
right
of
action,
if
it
is
so
interpreted,
if
it
is
so
limited
to
action
only
on
a
surety
bond.
here
we
have
to...
if
the
court
is
going
to
rule
on
this
question
of
the
existence
of
a
right
of
action,
this
court
must
in
order
to
be
fair
presume
that
the
situation
is
as
it
was
in
mcdaniel,
and
which
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
in
this
case
that
the
situation
was
the
same,
that
our
petitioner
has
not
submitted
miller
act
bonds
or
any
other
kind
of
surety
payment
bond
that
the
employee
can
proceed
upon,
and
that
the
comptroller
general
has
not
withheld
sums
to
assure
payment
to
these
laborers.
certainly
this
court,
unless
it
makes
that
presumption
cannot
rule
appropriately
on
my
opponent's
suggestion
that
there
is
no
right
of
action
existing
under
circumstances
such
as
these.
i
am
not...
and
i
make
this
clear
again...
i
am
not
asserting
that
there's
an
alternate
implied
right
of
action
for
use
by
employees
under
any
and
all
circumstances
as
an
alternative
to
going
through
the
surety
payment
bond
procedure
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
in
that
way.
i
am
saying
that
if
those
remedies
are
rendered
ineffective
and
unavailable
and
particularly
if
they're
rendered
ineffective
and
unavailable
because
of
action
or
inaction
by
the
contractor
and
maybe
cooperation
by
the
government,
that
the
employee
does
have
this
right
of
action.
congress
intended
it,
and
the
courts
should
make
sure
that--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--well,
i
know
that
your
honor
wants
direct
answers
so
i'm
going
to
give
you
one:
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
that's
true.
and
may...
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
there
is
no
coverage
determination
saying
that
the
davis-bacon
act
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
if
the
court
please,
they
referred
to
it,
they
spoke
about
it,
they
did
everything
except
put
a
long
list
of
stipulations
in
the
contract.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
government
and
my
opponent
have
not
referred
to
any
government
agency
determination
that
this
is
not
a
davis-bacon
act
contract.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
the
davis-bacon
act
requires
that
there
be
certain
stipulations;
that's--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--well...
or
the
parties...
well,
i
know
the
reason
why
they
did
not
include
that:
because
they
intended
that
all
davis-bacon
work
under
this
davis-bacon
contract
was
to
be
subcontracted,
and
that
the
subcontracts
would
include
those
stipulations.
but
here
we
are
asserting...
and
we
are
at
the
stage
where
this
must
be
accepted
by
the
court.
we
are
asserting
on
behalf
of
these
laborers
that
they
did
certain
amounts
of
the
davis-bacon
act
work.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
that's
what
i
contend,
even--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--no,
it's
a
letter,
a
memorandum
of
understanding
in
our
joint
appendix.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
later
pages.
two
letters;
excuse
me:
one
at
the
time
of
the
original
signing
of
the
contract
in
1968,
and
again
in
a
memorandum
of
understanding
that
i
was
able
to
discover
when
modification
14
was
made
by
the
parties.
modification
14
was
the
big
modification
of
this
contract,
so
at
both
times
the
government
and
the
petitioner
agreed
between
themselves
that
in
the
event
that
the
contractor
does
any
of
this
work
with
its
own
work
force...
and
these
employees
whom
i
represent
are
in
its
own
work
force...
that
the
contract
will
be
modified.
and
i
say
it
is
modified
thereby
to
include
the
davis-bacon
act
stipulations
concerning
these
employees.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
well,
if
the
court
please,
even
this
davis-bacon
committee...
it's
an
informal
committee;
it's
not
as
formal
as
counsel
would
let
us
believe,
and
i
was
present
at
the
depositions
where
it
was
described.
this
informal
davis-bacon
act
committee
of
three
people
in
the
local
abc
office
was
presented
with
requests
for
davis-bacon
act
determinations...
they're
referred
to
in
my
brief
also...
approximately
135
during
the
period
of
years,
for
various
kinds
of
work.
and
126
of
those
requests
were
returned
by
this
davis-bacon
act
committee
saying,
this
is
davis-bacon
act
work.
now,
i
submit
that
certain
of
the
davis-bacon
act
work
done
under
this
contract,
and
maybe
a
lot
of
it
that
was
done
pursuant
to
those
determinations...
determinations,
now,
if
we
need
determinations...
by
the
government
agency
here
involved,
certain
of
that
work
was
done
by
my
people.
and
if
so,
they
are
entitled
to
be
paid.
congress
intended
it,
and
nobody,
not
their
decision...
not
to
call
this
a
davis-bacon
act
contract...
not
their
decision,
not--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--well,
there's
question
as
to
how
that's
effectuated,
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
know
how
that's
done.
the
davis-bacon
act
itself
does
not
say
how
that
shall
be
done.
all
we
know
is
that
the
comptroller
general
is
supposed
to
withhold
certain
sums
of
money.
we
don't
know
who
asks
the
comptroller
general
to
do
it
or
how
the
comptroller
general
decides
that.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
i
think
that
there
is
such
a
duty.
i
think
there
is.
i'm
not
proceeding
on
that
duty.
i'm
not
suing
the
government
in
this
case.
i'm
proceeding
against
my
client's
employer
because
the
obligation
of
the
davis-bacon
act
is
upon
the
employer
to
pay,
and
it's
been
referred
to
again
and
again
by
congress
and
by
the
courts
as
being...
and
by
this
court...
as
being
a
statute
that
requires
the
payment
to
laborers
and
mechanics
concerning
government
contracts
involving
construction,
alteration
and
repair,
including
painting
and
decorating,
of
wages
which
the
secretary
of
labor
has
determined
are
the
prevailing
wages
in
a
particular
area
for
that
type
of
work.
by
the
way,
the
government
in
its
brief
has
also
said
that
if
we
look
at
the
payment
schedules...
some
of
which
the
petitioner
has
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
if
we
look
at
payment
schedules,
the
government
has
said
it
is
clear
that
certain
of
the
amounts
received
by
my
clients...
actually
received...
were
less
than
what
the
prevailing
wages
would
have
required
that
they
be
paid.
so
we
have...
there
is
no
question
that
these
people
have
not
been
paid
what
they
are
owed.
there
is
no
question
that
congress
commanded
that
the
prevailing
wage
principle
be
effectuated.
and
by
the
way,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
comptroller
general
has
just
done
a
survey
and
there
are
77
statutes
concerning
federally
assisted
contract
situations,
77
statutes
in
which
the
davis-bacon
act
is
referred
to
and
in
these
77
statutes
it
is
required
that
davis-bacon
obligations
be
performed,
that
payment
of
wages
be
made
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
wage
principle
of
the
davis-bacon
act
and
the
davis-bacon
act
is
cited
in
each
of
those
statutes.
i
don't
know
what
effect
if
any
this
court's
decision
will
have
on
the
41
state
"little
davis-bacon
acts"
which
exist
throughout
the
country.
i'm
not
representing
that
it
will
have
or
not
have
any
effect,
but
it
shows
the
pervading
effect
and
acceptance
of
the
prevailing
wage
principle,
not
only
by
congress
in
the
davis-bacon
act,
not
only
by
congress
in
the
77
other
statutes
that
refer
to
federally
assisted
programs
and
construction,
but
also
throughout
the
rest
of
these
united
states.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
if
the
court
please,
i
suggest
that
the
agency
has
no
function
in
deciding
or
not
deciding
with
any
binding
effect
that
a
contract
is
covered
or
not.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
jay
nye
i
assume
that
that's
what
they
are
saying,
and
to
that
extent--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--it
is--
mr.
robert
jay
nye
--there
is
no...
absolutely,
there
is
no
administrative
remedy.
if
there
were
one
we
wouldn't
be
going
through
the
courts.
we
would
be
proceeding
with
a
much
easier
administrative
remedy,
but
we
have
none,
if
the
court
please.
it
is
our
view
and
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
