mr.
robert
e.
mann
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
davis-bacon
act
a
federal
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
revise
a
public
contract
upon
suit
by
a
private
party
against
a
private
contractor
without
regard
to
the
actions
or
inactions
of
the
agency
party
to
the
contract.
the
case
arises
at
the
fermi
national
accelerator
lab
near
batavia,
illinois,
which
is
a
high
energy
physics
research
establishment
housing
the
world's
largest
proton
accelerator.
the
petitioner
is
an
association
of
universities
which
has
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
federal
government,
originally
through
the
atomic
energy
commission,
and
more
recently
with
the
department
of
energy,
to
manage
the
fermi
national
accelerator
laboratory.
all
funds
for
the
construction
and
management
of
the
laboratory
are
supplied
by
the
federal
government
through
provisions
in
the
contract.
the
petitioner's
role
is
that
of
manager,
to
supervise
construction,
to
supervise
the
operation,
and
to
supervise
the
maintenance
of
the
facility.
to
carry
out
its
responsibilities,
the
petitioner
association
is
authorized
by
the
government
to
hire
individuals
to
work
in
various
categories,
such
as
physicist,
engineer,
technician,
clerical
person,
et
cetera,
and
all
funds
for
the
compensation
of
those
persons
are
provided
by
the
federal
government
in
accordance
with
the
contract.
there
are
rate
schedules
attached
to
the
contract
which
have
been
agreed
to
by
the
government
as
appropriate
for
payment
of
the
individuals
employed
by
the
petitioner.
the
claimant
in
this
case
maintains
that
notwithstanding
his
employment
as
an
electronics
technician,
that
is,
one
assigned
to
monitor
computers,
operate
accelerators,
and
assist
in
research
functions,
he
should
have
been
paid
at
area
electrician
construction
rates
pursuant
to
the
davis-bacon
act.
the
contract
specifically
provides
that
the
parties
did
not
contemplate
performance
of
construction
work
by
persons
employed
by
the
association,
and
therefore
there
are
no
davis-bacon
act
stipulations
in
the
contract.
the
federal
district
court
issued
two
rulings.
the
first
ruling
held
that
in
the
absence
of
an
express
davis-bacon
act
provision
in
the
contract
there
could
be
no
right
of
recovery.
the
case
was
left
open
for
purposes
of
allowing
the
plaintiff
to
show
if
he
could
that
the
government
had
made
separate
determinations
regarding
his
work
as
being
construction
in
nature.
after
the
taking
of
a
number
of
depositions,
other
discovery,
freedom
of
information
act
requests,
the
plaintiff
was
forced
to
conclude
that
he
could
show
no
prior
agency
determination
that
his
work
was
in
fact
covered
by
the
davis-bacon
act.
consequently,
the
federal
district
court
granted
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
upon
that
result.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
effect,
held
that
regardless
of
the
express
inclusion
of
davis-bacon
act
provisions
in
this
contract,
they
were
included
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
the
federal
district
court
would
have
authority
in
effect
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency
regarding
the
construction
nature
of
the
plaintiff's
work,
to
set
an
appropriate
wage
scale,
and
to
set
up
an
appropriate
classification.
in
doing
so
it
extrapolated
from
its
1977
mcdaniel
case
in
which
it
held
that
there
was
an
implied
right
of
action
to
enforce
express
contract
terms
setting
forth
davis-bacon
act
requirements.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
proceeding
arising
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
challenging
agency
action.
it
is
not
a
proceeding
arising
under
a
contract
action
based
upon
express
contract
commitments.
our
petitioner
here
has
never
entered
into
a
contract
agreeing
to
pay
davis-bacon
act
rates.
it
is
not
an
action
to
enforce
a
self-enforcing
statute,
such
as
an
equal
opportunity
clause,
which
is
directed
to
the
beneficiary
party
without
regard
to
government
actions.
this
is
an
action
which
attempts
to
maintain
a
private
cause
of
action
to
secure
a
judicial
determination
as
to
coverage
of
the
davis-bacon
act,
application
of
particular
wages
and
classifications.
the
effect
is
to
substitute
the
federal
courts
for
the
agencies'
contracting
officers
regarding
these
matters
of
coverage,
classification,
and
rates.
not
only
that,
the
action
is
brought
against
a
not-for-profit
entity
which
does
not
stand
to
gain
or
lose,
depending
on
what
rates
are
paid
to
the
employees.
and
it
is
brought
after
the
contract
has
already
been
performed.
it
is
not
being
brought
in
anticipation
of
the
contract,
as
some
recent
cases
have
been
brought,
but
after
the
contract
was
performed
the
federal
district
court
was
asked
to
revise
the
contract
to
include
specific
davis-bacon
act
provisions
and
to
hold
the
defendant
not-for-profit
contractor
liable
without
regard
to
the
agency
action
that
it
had
contracted
with.
as
the
court
undoubtedly
knows,
the
davis-bacon
act
emerged
along
with
other
pieces
of
legislation
in
the
same
legislative
era
of
the
'30s,
including
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
walsh-healey
act,
and
of
course
the
davis-bacon
act
and
other
provisions
requiring
the
payment
of
wages
at
certain
levels
in
order
to
rectify
conditions
that
had
resulted
from
the
depression.
there
are
significant
differences,
however,
between
the
davis
bacon-act
and
the
walsh-healey
act,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
on
the
other.
the
same
congress
that
enacted
these
statutes
provided
that
the
davis-bacon
act
and
walsh-healey
act
policies
would
be
enforced
through
the
vehicle
of
contract,
and
not
only
through
the
vehicle
of
contract
but
through
the
vehicle
of
administrative
pre-determination
of
what
the
obligations
would
be.
conversely,
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
the
universal
minimum
wage
and
hours
of
work
standard
was
set
and
the
parties
affected
by
that
were
expressly
given
the
right
to
file
suit
to
enforce
their
rights
independently
of
the
government
to
secure
their
wages.
congress
was
concerned
about
the
social
goal
that
it
had,
that
is,
to
make
sure
that
local
wage
and
labor
markets
were
not
disrupted,
but
also
was
concerned
about
maintaining
efficiency
in
government
contracting.
and
so
it
struck
a
balance.
it
struck
a
balance
in
the
davis-bacon
act,
and
the
fulcrum
of
that
balance
is
the
concept
of
predetermination,
so
that
before
the
contract
is
gone
into
and
executed,
all
parties
know
what
their
obligations
are
and
no
one
can
be
heard
to
complain
if
the
obligations
prove
too
onerous.
what
we
have
here
is
an
attempt
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondents
to
upset
that
fulcrum,
to
establish
a
principle
whereby
the
federal
courts
after
the
contract
has
been
executed,
notwithstanding
the
predetermination
concept,
are
in
a
position
to
go
back
and
determine
that
something
should
have
been
paid
at
a
different
rate
than
it
was.
the
concept
of
predetermination,
which
is
embedded
in
the
davis-bacon
act,
was
a
topic
of
the
legislative
amendments
to
that
act
in
1935.
prior
to
1935
there
was
no
provision
for
predetermination.
in
1935,
after
a
four-year
history
of
some
confusion
in
applying
the
law,
congress
expressly
amended
it
to
provide
for
predetermination,
so
that
the
contract
would
carry
the
obligations
and
not
some
implied
obligations
based
upon
a
post-analysis
of
the
work.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
we
have
taken
the
position
on
that
question,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
there
is
under
the
act
no
private
right
of
action
at
all,
even
to
recover
under
express
provisions.
there
may
be
a
right
of
action
in
a
state
court,
under
a
state
common
law
theory
of
third-party
beneficiary,
but
not
in
federal
court,
because
there's
no
real
federal
question
there;
it's
a
contract
question
involved
there.
so
we've
taken
the
position
that
even
if
there
were
an
express
contract
that
there
would
not
be
a
private
right
to
go
to
court.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
position
of
the
7th
circuit...
that
question
was
not
asked
in
the
7th
circuit,
and
that
issue
was
not
actually
before
us.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
in
the
trial
court
the
question
of
the
private
right
of
action
per
se
was
raised
in
the
context
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
revise
the
contract.
that
is,
we
didn't
really
address
the
issue
whether
in
general
there
is
a
private
right
to
enforce
a
specific
clause,
but
whether
there
is
a
private
right
to
obtain
the
court
determination
of
the
fundamental
issues
of
coverage,
of
classification
of
rate,
that
was
the
issue
presented
to
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
held
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
davis-bacon
act
to
in
effect
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
contracting
officer's
judgment,
at
least
without
having
had
some
effort
by
the
contracting
officer
to
be
involved,
some
appeal
to
him,
some--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--well,
i
believe
the
private
cause
of
action
comes
in,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
in
the
context
of
this
case,
to
in
effect
secure
a
coverage
determination
by
the
federal
court
as
opposed
to
the
contracting
agency.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
i
believe
that
the
evolved
law
under
the
davis-bacon
act
would
hold
that
if
the
agency
wishes
to
come
in
and
amend
the
contract,
the
agency
may
find
itself
liable
for
increased
cost,
as
an
amendment
for
the
convenience
of
the
government,
for
example.
i
believe
there
have
been
comptroller
general
decisions
and
perhaps
some
court
of
claims
decisions
which
say
that
the
government
does
not
have
as
a
matter
of
right
the
right
to
come
in
and
amend
its
determination,
and
yet
still
hold
the
contractor
unequivocally
liable
as
though
the
amendment
had
occurred
at
the
outset.
but
i
believe
that
the
concept
of
predetermination
is
flexible
enough
to
permit
the
agency
itself,
upon
its
own
motion
or
upon
the
appeal
of
some
party
to--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--that's
correct.
and--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--our
view
of
the
law
is
that
they
cannot.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
well,
except
that
the
private
cause
of
action
raises
a
question
as
to
who
is
going
to
control
the
terms
of
the
contract.
i
think
it's
one
thing
if
one
of
the
contracting
parties,
that
is,
the
government,
moves
to
amend
the
contract
for
its
advantage
in
one
way
or
another.
but
these
are
after
all
public
contracts
and
there's
public
policy
as
well
as
economics
involved,
and
for
a
third
party
to
come
in
and
say,
irrespective
of
what
the
agency
thinks
about
how
the
law
should
be
applied,
i
believe
this
was
davis-bacon
work
and
i
want
an
amendment;
we
believe
that
that
raises--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--i
would
assume
that.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
there's
an
express
term
in
the
contract,
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
there
is
a--
mr.
robert
e.
mann
--by
hypothesis;
that's
correct.
the
7th
circuit
in
both
mcdaniel
i
and
mcdaniel
ii
indicated
in
the
course
of
their
opinion
that
they
assumed
that
there
were
express
provisions.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
so
far
as
we
know,
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
only
lawsuit
that
has
been
brought
is
by
the
private
individual.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
the
private
cause
of
action
right?
mr.
robert
e.
mann
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
express
terms,
clearly
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
create
the
terms
that
are
being
enforced.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
that's
the
end
of
the
court
case.
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
this
time
i'm
ceding
my
time
to
ms.
shapiro
to
express
the
views
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
just
one,
comment,
jr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
reemphasize
that
it
is
our
position
that
in
order
to
hold
the
contractor
liable,
there
must
be
an
affirmative
predetermination
of
coverage,
and
the
coverage
must
be
not
only
the
wage
rates
but
the
existence
of
the
coverage
of
the
act
as
well,
because
the
agency
making
that
determination
is
the
other
contracting
party.
and
that
concept
is
embodied
in
the
comment
that
mr.
nye
referred
to
with
respect
to
the
contract,
which
is
shown
on
pages
62
and
63
of
the
appendix,
where
it
indicates
that
if
the
atomic
energy
commission
determines
that
work
is
covered
by
davis-bacon,
then
the
contract
will
be
amended.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
if
they
provided
that,
yes,
sir.
what
the
provisions
of
the
letter
agreement
say
is
that
if
the
atomic
energy
commission
determines
both
the
need
for
our
employees
to
do
the
work
and
that
the
work
is
covered,
then
the
contract
will
be
amended.
mr.
robert
e.
mann
right.
in
advance.
if
we
agree...
it's
in
advance.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
