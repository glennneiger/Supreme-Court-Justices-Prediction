mr.
robert
h.
friebert
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
robert
friebert
and
i
represent
the
state
party
in
this
action.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think,
asked
one
of
the
critical
questions
and
that
is
whether
this
election
is
a
part
of
the
constitutional
electoral
process.
it
is.
it's
the
beginning
of
the
electoral
process
by
which
states
nominate
and
elect
electors
to
elect
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
it's
up
to
the
state
to
determine
how--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--to
choose
their
electors.
and
in
wisconsin
it's
a
very
complex
process.
it's
a
complex
process
throughout
the
country.
it
starts
with,
in
wisconsin,
primaries
which,
in
wisconsin,
has
decided
that
every
citizen
should
have
an
opportunity
at
least
once
every
four
years
to
determine
who
they
want
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
not
wait
until
november
when
the
choices
are
narrowed
by
the
national
parties.
and
so
that's
the
beginning
of
the
process
which
culminates
in
the
national
party
having
automatic
ballot
access
in
wisconsin,
just
by
having
the
results
of
nominating
convention...
it's
automatically
on
the
ballot
with
the
party
name
listed.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
i
would
say
that.
absolutely.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
national
party
is
regulated
as
to
when
these
primaries
take
place.
i
think
that
what
is
being
missed
here...
excuse
me--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--it
may,
to
a
point.
it
can
regulate
it
to
achieve
a
certain
state
fundamental
interest.
for
example,
i
think
it
could
regulate
the
caucus
to
make
sure
that
blacks
and
other
minorities
are
not
interfered
with
in
their
right
to
associate
and
that
has
been
long
held
in
the
united
states
v.
classic.
once
it's
conceded
that
we
have
a
public--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--i
think,
i
think
when--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
the
white
primary
cases
and
there's
a
generic
statement,
did
involve
blacks.
the
point
is
that
when
we
have
a
decision
like
moose
lodge
from
the
court,
we
have,
i
believe,
a
statement
from
the
court
that
in
order
for
any
of
the
14th,
15th
amendment
grants
to
be
applicable
you
must
have
a
finding
that
the
particular
activity
involved
constitutes
public
action.
and
i
think
that
it's
very
clear
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
especially
footnote
16
in
buckley
v.
valeo,
that
at
this
point
in
our
history
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
primary
contests,
party
primary
contests
are
elections
and
that
they
can
be
heavily
regulated
because
there
is
a
public
action
that
is
taking
place
and
that
there
would
be
a
certain
amount
of
retreat
from
that
if
we
could
say
that
this
reform
measure
at
the
turn
of
the
century
from
wisconsin
which
outlawed
the
very
thing
that
the
national
party
wanted
to
superimpose
in
wisconsin...
the
very
thing
that
was
done
in
michigan.
in
michigan,
the
attorney
general
declared
that
their
open
primary
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
the
whole
process
was
displaced
with
a
party
caucus
where
there
were
fees
to
be
paid
and
as
a
result,
only
15,000
people
determined
the
delegates
from
the
state
of
michigan.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
the
way
this
country
has
gone
and
that
is
not
the
direction
that
it
should
go;
that
it's
a
step
back
and
that
a
reform
measure
to
increase
voter
participation
in
election
process
has
been
viewed
as,
in
buckley,
with
great
favor.
and
in
this
context,
we're
not
talking
about
the
seating
of
delegates.
we...
the
wisconsin
statute
couldn't
care
less
who
are
the
delegates.
the
only
thing
that
it
has
focused
upon
is
the
apportionment
process
by
which
the
will
of
the
voters
at
the
primary
becomes
effective
and
that's
the
reason
the
injunction
was
entered.
it
is
very
narrow
in
scope.
and
beyond
that,
in
all
of
the
other
party
business,
the
wisconsin
statute
couldn't
care
less.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
the
theory
on
which
the
injunction
was
entered
is
the
basic
power
that
a
state
has
when
it
is
in
the
regulating
area
of
voter
qualifications
to
make
its
laws
effective.
and
in
light
of
cousins,
and
the
kind
of
meshing
of
kinds
of
public
action
by
a
national
party
and
private
action,
it
should
be
done
in
the
least
offensive
manner
to
make
the
law
effective.
the
citizens
of
wisconsin
have
a
constitutional
right
as...
or
a
right
as
created
by
the
legislature
of
wisconsin
to
vote
in
these
primaries,
then
the
law
can
be
made
effective
in
a
way
which
doesn't
impair
the
associational
interests
of
the
national
party.
and
i
think
that
that's
what
this
court
indicated
in
rosario,
for
example,
that
by
saying
the
states
can
regulate
they
can
make
their
laws
effective.
and
it's
in
a
very,
very
unoffensive
way
that
the
law
is
made
effective.
indeed--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
i
think
it's
an
illusory
controversy,
they
come...
the
national
party
comes
in
and
claims
a
great
deprivation
of
the
first
amendment
rights
without
in
any
way
demonstrating
that
any
of
their
other
programs
for
selecting
delegates
would
have
any
different
kind
of
apportionment.
i
think
that
they
have
the
burden
in
claiming
the
first
amendment
rights
violations,
not
to
speculate
about
just
what
the
impact
would
be.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
don't
get
into
the
state
justification--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--yes.
but
it
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far,
because
they,
the
national
party--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--i
agree.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
don't
back,
i
back
away...
the
way
the
state
party
way
of
presenting
the
brief,
because
i
don't
have
to
reach
that
question,
because
of
several
reasons.
one,
if
it
is
recognized
that
this
is
a
public
interest
or
public
action
activity
by
the
national
party,
then
it
seems
to
follow,
it
can
be
regulated.
and
by
definition,
almost
by
constitutional
definition,
it
is
not
a
first
amendment
problem.
secondly,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
context
of
apportionment
of
delegate
strength
among
various
contenders
for
president
that
anything
would
be
any
different
if
a
different
method
were
used.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no.
it's
a
part
of
the
process
which
results
in...
result
of
that
convention
gets
automatic
valid
access.
the
party
can't
go
walk
down
a
one-way
street.
they
love
the
automatic
ballot
access,
they
love
having
their
name
on
the
wisconsin
ballot,
they
love
the
context
and
the
appointments
that
they
get
in
wisconsin
just
by
virtue
of
being
a
party,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
intertwining
is
a
two-way
street.
and
i
think
that
that...
the
two-way
street
is
that
it
is
private,
in
some
respects
as
is
stated
in
cousins
and
it
is
public
in
other
respects,
especially
when
we're
talking
about
the
critical
franchise
which
is
given
by
a
state.
and
in
federal
elections
it
can
be
further
regulated
by
congress
if
it
chooses
to
come
into
the
area.
so
that
the
full
extent
of
the
national
party's
position
is
that
wisconsin
could
conduct
a
closed
primary
only
if
they
wanted
a
closed
primary.
if
they
wanted
caucuses,
they
could
outlaw
it
too.
it's
the
full
extent...
of
their
position
is
that
these
state
laws
only
are
enforced
if
they
want
then
to
be
enforced.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
national
party,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
they
just
won't
let
them
be...
any
meaning
to
them.
they
are
perfectly
valid
and
the
state
of
wisconsin
can
go
out
and
have
an
intellectual
exercise--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--i
think
cousins
v.
wigoda,
it
doesn't...
it's
not
the
best
applicable
case
to
this.
i
think
it
is
buckley...
but
cousins
had
as
one
of
its
major,
major
aspects
is
that
they
were
concerned
there
with
who
were
the
delegates,
which
we
are
not
concerned
with
here,
here
we
are
concerned
with
who
are
the
voters.
and
that
is
a
completely
different
question,
and
i
think
extremely
important--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--we
care
how
they
vote
at
the
convention
on
the
first
ballot,
and
beyond,
and
that's
the
only
thing
we
care
about.
nothing
else.
we
don't
care
who
does
it.
that
is
a
private
matter.
i
think
it
accommodates
cousins.
but
cousins
involved
a...
there
was
no
conflict
between
a
state
law
in
cousins
as
such,
and
a
party
rule,
because--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--no,
the
illinois
law
was
neutral
on
the
process
by
which
delegates
could
be
chosen.
what
happened
there
is,
we
had
an
intra-party
squabble
between
people
in
the
chicago
area
who
were
enforcing
a
slate.
and
that
was
the
real
underlying
fight.
and
then
they
hid
under
the
illinois
law,
to
say,
now
you've
got
to
accept
our
previous
violation
to
the
rule,
i
think
that
that's
what
is
underneath
cousins.
very
much
what's
underneath
cousins.
they
used
the
illinois
law
as
a
refuge
in
an
attempt
to
circumvent
the
national
rules,
that
that's
what
was
at
stake
and
therefore
is
a
complete--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--no,
it's
not...
the
state
party
of
wisconsin
is
not
the
wisconsin
legislature
and
what
we
had
in
illinois
was
a
state
party
or
a
chicago
party
attempting
by
its
slate-making
processes--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--it
did
comply
fully,
but
they
didn't
comply
with
the
party
rule--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--because
they
were
slate-making;
they
was
no
juggernaut
between
the
state
party,
the
national
rules
and
the
illinois
law,
which
is
true
here,
and
besides
that,
it
was
going
to
a
different
interest.
in
this
case,
we
are
in
the
interest
of
apportioning
the
will
of
the
wisconsin
voters
to
the
choices
made
in
the
party.
that
was
not
an
issue
in
illinois;
illinois
does
not
have,
i
don't
believe,
a
choice,
or
at
least
not
in
1976
or
'72,
a
binding
primary,
it
was
advisory
only.
so
the
illinois--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--yes,
but
not
the
more
fundamental
point
as
to
who
should
be
president
of
the
united
states,
that's
a
lot
more
important
to
the
public
than
who
the
delegates
are,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
on
the
nomination
process,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
in
effectuating
the
will--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--oh,
i
think
it's
the
first
step
in
the
process
by
which
people
become
president
or
nominees
for
president
of
the
united
states,
and
it
is
intertwined
in
the
voter
qualification
dowers
that
we
have
as
a
state,
subject
to
congressional
regulation
in
a
federal
election
and
also
under
the
12th
amendment
as
a
part
of
a
complex
process
for
its
electors--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--that's
a
choice
that
the
wisconsin
statute
gives;
a
winner
take
all
statute.
the
wisconsin
statute
allows
a
winner
take
all,
but
the
party
can
choose
apportion
and
the
party
has
chosen
apportionment
in
this
instance.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
thank
you.
