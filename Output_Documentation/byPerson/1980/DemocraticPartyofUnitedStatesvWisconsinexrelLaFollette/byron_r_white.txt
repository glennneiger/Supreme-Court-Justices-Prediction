justice
white
well
why...
tell
me
why
the
case
isn't
moot,
then?
i
thought
your
claim
was
that
you
wanted
to
be...
the
party
wanted
to
be
free
from
this
kind
of
a
statute.
or
from
this
state
effort
to
throw
primaries
open
to
possible
members
of
the
other
party.
justice
white
i
see.
where
is
the
order,
mr.
eastman,
do
you
know?
justice
white
well
it
just
says
the
presidential
preference
primary.
to
the
democratic
national...
you
mean,
that's
all
the
primaries
from
here
on
in?
justice
white
i
don't
know
why
you
don't...
i
don't
know
why
you
back
off
from
saying
your
claim
is
that
the
statute,
that
the
open
primary
is
unconstitutional.
justice
white
well
i
thought
you
just
said
that
except
for
this
order
there's
nothing
wrong
with
an
open
primary
statute.
justice
white
it
was--
justice
white
--so
you
are
saying
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
the
face
of
a
contrary
party
rule?
justice
white
well
i
know
that
your
court
said
the
impact
was
speculative
and
therefore
the
case
was
over
just
on
that
ground.
justice
white
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
even
if
it
isn't...
even
if
it
were
substantial
there's
a
state
justification.
justice
white
now,
do
you
make
that
claim
too?
justice
white
you
mean,
you
stop
short
of
that?
justice
white
the
state
court
went
that
far,
and
if
it
easier
to
accept
that
branch
of
its
judgment
than
the
other--
justice
white
--or
do
you,
you
back
away
from
that
part
of
it,
though.
justice
white
even
if
the
state
said
apportion
according
to
the
vote
and
the
democratic
party
said
winner
take
all?
justice
white
it's
true,
you
would
take
the
same
position
both
ways?
justice
white
--because
the
statute
is
still
of
operative
force.
justice
white
it
would
be
the
same
issue,
wouldn't
it?
