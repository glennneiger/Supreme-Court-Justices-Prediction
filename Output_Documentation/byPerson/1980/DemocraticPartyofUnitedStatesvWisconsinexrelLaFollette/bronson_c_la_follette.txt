mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
want
to
make
a
correction
on
the
factual
circumstances
concerning
the
montana
presidential
primary.
this
is
contained
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
montana
and
the
state
of
washington
on
page
3,
i
believe
it
is.
there,
the
procedure
for
the
montana
primary
is
set
forth
and
under
montana
law,
each
political
party
has
the
right
to
choose
its
method
for
selection
of
delegates
and
under
that
law
in
1980,
the
democratic
party
of
montana
chose
to
select
its
delegates
through
the
open
primary.
and
as
stated
there,
that's
a
policy
which
also
violates
the
rules
of
the
democratic
national
committee.
so
wisconsin
is
not
the
only
court...
excuse
me,
the
only
state
that
has...
is
subject
to
the
rule
of...
in
conflict
with
state
law
in
this
case.
i
will
address
the
impact
of
the
party
rule
upon
the
state
electoral
and
political
process.
wisconsin
voter
surveys
indicate
that
the
largest
class
of
party
identifiers
in
wisconsin
as
well
as
in
most
states
of
the
country
identify
themselves
as
political
independents.
at
stake
here
is
the
impact
of
the
rule
upon
independents,
republicans,
minor
party
adherents
and
others
who
value
their
privacy.
what
are
their
rights
under
the
party
rule?
there
are
absolutely
none.
on
the
other
hand
under
the
authority
of
article
ii,
section
1,
wisconsin
law
recognizes
and
protects
their
rights
to
participate
in
the
candidate
selection
process
leading
to
the
election
of
the
highest
office
in
the
land.
and
it
protects
those
rights
to
participate
in
a
free
and
open
manner
without
a
declaration
of
party
loyalty
as
a
condition
of
exercising
the
basic
right
of
all,
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
the
root
of
all
basic
rights,
the
right
to
vote.
what
are
the
interests
that
the
wisconsin
open
primary
serves?
it's
important
to
note
that
the
direct
primary,
wisconsin
being
the
first
state
to
enact
such
a
law
in
1905,
was
a
reform
effort
to
cleanse
the
political
process,
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
dominated
by
special
interests
who
controlled
the
selection
of
candidates
through
the
political
caucuses.
these
privacy
interests
are
eloquently
stated
by
the
amicus
brief
of
washington
and
montana,
and
the
brief
of
editor
maraniss,
i
won't
go
into
them
here.
this
interest
broadly
serves
the
expansion
of
the
franchise,
it
encourages
i
voting,
and
it
works.
wisconsin
has
been
in
the
top
three
of
voter
participation
turnout
in
the
presidential
elections
in
this
past
decade.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
no
case
thus
far
decided
by
this
court
has
struck
down
a
law
which
expanded
the
franchise
to
too
many
people
and
there
is
no
reasonable
justification
by
the
appellant
to
do
so
now.
our
system--
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
--this
court
has
recognized
that
states
asserting
authority
under
article
ii
of
the
constitution
have...
are...
have
wide
interests
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
primary
elections
and
determining
the
qualification
of
voters
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process;
storer
v.
brown,
and
most
recently,
marchioro,
are
relevant
on
this
point.
and
of
course
we
must
remember,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish,
the
types
of
political
activities
that
a
party
engages
in.
number
one,
it's
obviously
a
most
important
process,
we
call
the
public
function.
and
that
is
the
gathering
together
of
individuals
in
a
political
convention
to
select
one
of
the
two
candidates
who
ultimately
will
become
president
of
the
united
states.
this
process,
we
contend,
is
part
of
an
overall
electoral
process
which
states--
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
--it
is
no
part
of
the
constitutional
electoral
process.
the
party
also
gathers
together
in
convention
to
conduct
many
other
kinds
of
activities.
it
writes
a
platform,
it
establishes
rules,
it
does
many
things
that
govern
the
internal
or
intra-party
affairs
of
the
convention.
and
we
contend
that
this
distinction
must
be
given
great
weight
by
this
court
in
permitting
states
to
establish
voter
qualifications
for
citizens
within
their
borders.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
your
honor,
the
record
which
has
been
stipulated
here
contains
all
of
the
relevant
studies
and
scholarly
articles
which
relate
to
that
question
and
they
all
conclude
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
raiding
in
this
case.
and
in
fact,
their
own
document,
the
winograd
commission,
concludes
that
whether
or
not
the
wisconsin
law
has
experienced
raiding
is
speculative,
merely
speculation.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
not
when
important
constitutional
concerns
that
are
properly
arrested
for
the
authority
of
the
state.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
marchioro
said,
recognized
that
the
important
role
that
the
parties
play
in
the
selection
of
national
and
state
candidates
grants
significant
authority
in
the
states
to
regulate
those
elections
in
terms
of
all
of
the
regulations
that
election
laws
presume,
voter
qualifications,
to...
in
order
to
insure
the
integrity
of
that
process.
that
is
the
constitutional
principle
that
we
believe
is
enunciated
in
a
long
line
of
cases
relating
to
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
i'd
like
to
address
that
question,
your
honor.
yes,
i
believe
that's--
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
--right,
i
certainly
will.
i
believe
that
that's
a
very
important
issue.
the
question
of
the
extent
and
whether
or
not
the
wisconsin
order
has
chosen
the
narrowest
means
possible
to
effectuate
its
purpose.
first
of
all,
let's
examine
the
form
of
the
injunction
in
cousins.
in
cousins,
there
was
a
state
court
injunction
which
was
issued
against
named
individuals
which
forbade
them
from
directly
associating
with
a
political
convention
which
they
wanted
to
associate
with
and
which
wanted
them
to
come
in
and
be
delegates.
and
a
criminal
contempt
process
was
pending
at
the
time
that
these
issues
came
before
this
court,
having
of
course
been
stayed
by
the
lower
courts.
the...
probably
the
issue
involved
in
that
case,
involved
the
affirmative
action
rules
of
the
parties
as
far
as
slate-making,
as
far
as
age,
race,
sex;
those
kinds
of
qualifications
were
at
issue
in
that
case.
and
there
was
an
intervention
by
a
state
court,
telling
the
party
and
the
delegates
who
were
chosen
by
private
caucuses
pursuant
to
party
rules,
that
met
all
of
these
qualifications
that
those
folks
couldn't
go
to
the
democratic
national
convention
as
delegates
because
these
other
folks
were
elected
under
state
law
and
state
law
prevails.
now
as
far
as
voting
qualification...
there's
one
thing
that
hasn't
been
said
yet.
and
that
is
that
under
wisconsin
direct
open
primary,
we
vote
for
candidates,
we
vote
for
president,
we
vote
for
the
names
on
the
ballot
in
the
wisconsin
democratic
party...
are
the
party
of
candidates
for
president.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
process
under
state
law
which
selects
the
delegates.
under
the
state
law
the
delegates
are
selected
after
the
primary
is
over
with,
by
the
state
party,
under
state
law
they
must
be
party
members,
they
must
be...
they
must
take,
the
only
issue
that
the
party
has,
is
that
they
must
take
a
pledge
under
state
law
to
vote
in
accordance
with
the
apportionment
that
are
the
results
of
the
primary
election.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
the
party
disagrees
with.
otherwise,
these
folks
comply
with
state
law,
they
are
chosen
by
the
party,
and
the
only
interference
by
this
wisconsin
court
order,
which
is
the
narrowest
that
could
possibly
be
drawn
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
primary
which
is
to
guarantee
the
vote
of
those
people
that
went
into
the
privacy
of
their
voting
booth
and
voted
for
those
particular
candidates.
and
we
feel
that
cousins
is
not
applicable
here,
and
in
fact,
we
would
draw
your
attention
to
buckley
v.
valeo
which
is,
we
feel,
much
more
in
point
as
far
as
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
where
this
court
recognized
that
in
the
question
of
disclosure
of
campaign
contributions,
that
public
disclosure
of
contributions
to
candidates
in
political
parties
will
deter
some
individuals
who
otherwise
might
contribute.
in
some
instances,
disclosure
may
even
expose
those
contributors
to
harassment
and
retaliation.
that's
u.s....
424
u.s.
at
68.
we
feel
that
the
minimum
intrusion
by
the
court
order
in
this...
in
the
court
below,
has...
certainly
does
not
rise
to
the
test
that
this
court
has
applied
that
it's
necessary
that
the
appellants
here
have
the
burden
to
show
that
they
have
been
substantially
interfered
with
in
their
associational
rights.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
it
is
a
matter
of
disenfranchisement.
and
i
would
also
point
out
the
wisconsin
open
primary
is
held
in
conjunction
with
the
spring
election
on
the
same
day
in
wisconsin
in
which
literally
thousands
of
our
locally
elected
officials,
our
judiciary,
our
mayors,
our
city
councilmen,
our
town
board
members,
are
all
elected
on
the
same
day
in
a
nonpartisan
election.
and
to
require
the
state
to
change
its
law
and
force
people
who
want
to
vote
in
these
elections
to
declare
their
party
allegiance
would
certainly
frustrate
the
very
substantial
purpose
in
wisconsin's
electoral
process.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
well,
we
contend
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
refuse.
they
must
meet
the
burden
that
this
court
has
laid
down
in
claiming
infringement
of
constitutional
rights
that
they
must
be
substantial.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
i
would
say
we
have
the
right--
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
--yes,
we
have
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
bronson
c.
la
follette
as
far
as
our
law
is
concerned.
thank
you.
