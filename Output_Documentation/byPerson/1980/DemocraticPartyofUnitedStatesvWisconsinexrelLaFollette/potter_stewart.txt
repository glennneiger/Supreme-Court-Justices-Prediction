justice
stewart
well
as
far
as
the
constitution
goes,
the
state
could
do
precisely
that,
couldn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
just
sort
of
be
completely
oblivious
to
the
republican
and
democratic
conventions
and
to
their
nominees.
justice
stewart
as
far
as
the
constitution
goes.
justice
stewart
because
the
state
hasn't
done
anything
like
that,
has
it?
justice
stewart
do
you
know
where
the
order
is,
in
the--
justice
stewart
--thank
you.
what
color?
justice
stewart
42(a)?
justice
stewart
but
not
over
30
pages.
justice
stewart
the
point
is
that
the
state
can't
tell
the
moose
lodge
who
to
take
as
its
members.
and
that's
state
action,
and
that
was
the
chief
justice's
question.
justice
stewart
and
we
had
a
case
here
in
this
court,
one
of
the
parties
to
whom
which
was
moose
lodge,
but
that's
quite
different.
justice
stewart
the
question
there
was
whether
the
action
of
that
organization
was
state
action,
that's
quite
a
different
question.
in
all
of
this,
i
think
you
ought
to
put
a
little
caveat
and
take
a
look
at
u.s.
against
classic,
when
you
say
how
private
primaries
are.
justice
stewart
it's
no
part
of
the
constitutional
electoral
process?
justice
stewart
well
now,
the
choosing
of
electors
is
in
the
constitution;
there's
nothing
in
there
about
political
parties.
justice
stewart
to
choose
their
electors,
yes.
justice
stewart
well
now,
that's
the
issue
here,
isn't
it,
as
my
brother
stevens
has
indicated?
your
state's
supreme
court
has
said
that
this
state
law
is
binding
on
the
democratic
national
committee
and
i'm,
when
i
use
the
word
binding,
i'm
quoting
from
the
injunction
they
ordered.
justice
stewart
and
that
is
what
makes
the
controversy
here,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
mr.
eastman,
the
wisconsin
delegation
was
in
fact,
seated
last
summer,
was
it
not?
justice
stewart
although
there
was
a
stay
of
the...
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
order,
was
there
not?
justice
stewart
so
there's
really
no
alternative,
at
least
there
was
no
other
delegation?
justice
stewart
and
why
isn't
this
moot?
justice
stewart
now
the
democratic
party
has
rules,
does
it
not,
requiring
that
state
delegations
be
representative
of
various,
or
have
certain
quotas
of
various
age
groups
and
genders
and...
there
being
only
two
genders...
and
be
racially
diverse
in
some
of
them,
does
it
not?
justice
stewart
so
that
if
a
state
law
should
say,
men
only
for
example,
or
people
only
over
35,
or
something
like
that,
that
would
also
in
your
view
be
unconstitutional
because
it
would
impair
your
constitutional
right
of
free
association?
justice
stewart
it
wasn't
a
state
action?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
eastman,
do
you...
so
if
this
injunction
order
were
revoked
at
this
time,
you
would
say
there's
still
a
case
or
controversy
here
that
should
be
decided?
if
the
injunction
were
revoked--
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
the
charter
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
united
states
provides
that
delegates
to
its
national
convention
shall
be
chosen
through
procedures
in
which
only
democrats
can
participate.
consistently
with
the
charter,
the
national
party's
delegate
selection
rules
provide
that
only
those
who
are
willing
to
affiliate
publicly
with
the
democratic
party
may
participate
in
the
process
of
selecting
delegates
to
the
party's
national
convention.
the
question
on
this
appeal
is
whether
wisconsin
may
successfully
insist
that
its
delegates
to
the
convention
be
seated,
even
though
those
delegates
are
chosen
through
a
process
that
includes
a
binding
state
preference
primary
election
in
which
voters
do
not
declare
their
party
affiliation.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
held
that
the
national
convention
is
bound
by
the
wisconsin
primary
election
results,
and
cannot
refuse
to
seat
the
delegates
chosen
in
accord
with
wisconsin
law.
for
the
reasons
set
out
at
some
length
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
the
judgement
is
reversed.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
