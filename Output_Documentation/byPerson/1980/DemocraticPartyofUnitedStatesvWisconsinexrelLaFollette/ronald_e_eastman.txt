mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
in
the
case,
in
this
case,
are
relatively
simple.
under
the
wisconsin
primary
election
statute,
a
voter
may
vote
in
the
presidential
preference
primary
of
any
party
he
or
she
chooses
without
regard
for
the
voter's
affiliation
or
any
declarations
of
support
for
the
party.
the
democratic
party,
in
contrast,
has
for
years
believed
that
only
democrats
should
participate
in
this
process
of
selecting
its
candidates.
over
the
years,
since
the
party
reform
effort
began
in
1968,
the
party
has
developed
a
rule
implementing
that
principle.
the
rule
provides
that
only
publicly
declared
democrats
may
participate
in
the
processes
of
selecting
the
democratic
nominee.
and
that
is
true
whether
those
processes
are
a
primary,
a
caucus
or
a
convention
system.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
think
the...
i
don't
believe
they
could
do
that.
but
i
believe
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--well
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
question--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--the
question
is
not
who
the
electors
would
be
in
the
electoral
college;
the
question
is,
who
will
be
the
delegates
to
the
democratic
national
convention.
now
there's
a
slight
difference
of
opinion,
or
at
least,
difference
of
emphasis
between
the
two
appellees,
as
to
what
exactly
is
the
state's
authority
to
enact
a
statute
regulating
the
primaries
of
major
political
parties;
that
is,
that
the
process
by
which
the
delegates
for
the
national
convention
are
chosen.
but
it
may
not
be
article
ii.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
well
i
had
a
sense
that
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
that
would
probably
preclude
that.
it
might
well
be
a
denial
of
the
federal
right
to
vote--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--i
think
as
far
as
the
constitution's
literal
language,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that
might
be
possible,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don't
think--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
well
i
think
that's
correct,
absolutely.
it's
not
the
case
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
state
has
enacted
primary
election
statutes
and
whether
it
has
done
so
pursuant
to
its
article
ii
power
or
whether
its
enactment
of
primary
statutes
is
pursuant
to
some
other
power,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
now
that
it's
legislated,
it
can
only
act
within
the
confines
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
thought
i
did,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
would
be
reluctant,
almost
as
an
academic
matter,
to
concede
that.
but
it's
not
relevant,
i
mean,
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
state
has
enacted
primary
election
statutes.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
has
interpreted
those
primary
election
statutes,
that
primary
election
statute,
as
precluding
the
democratic
party
from
seating
delegates,
any
delegates
other
than
those
who
comply
with
the
primary
election
statute.
so
yes,
i
could
concede
that
it's
simply
not
an
issue.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
don't
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
it
wouldn't
be
dictating
to
the
democratic
party
how
it
conducted
its
convention
and
which
delegates
it
selected.
it
may
raise
other
issues
and
other
problems,
but
it
wouldn't
raise
the
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it
wouldn't
be
dictating
how
they
selected
their
nominees
because
as
far
as
wisconsin's
nominees
were
selected...
as
far
as
the
state
of
wisconsin
was
concerned
the
nomination
of
the
major
parties
would
be
irrelevant,
under
your
hypothesis.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
there
are
only
two,
mr.
justice
blackmun;
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
state
of
michigan.
now
the
state
of
montana
has
come
before
the
court
as
an
amicus
and
claimed
that
it
has
an
open
primary.
i
must
say
i
don't
read
the
statute
that
way,
and
they
cited
no
authority
that
indicated
that
they
do
have
an
open
primary.
they
have
an
open
primary
but
it's
not
binding
on
the
delegates.
and
because
of
that,
it's
really
not...
that
the
primary
statute
wouldn't
be
affected
by
this
case.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that's
sufficient
under
the
national
rule.
the
national
rule,
rule
2(a),
requires
a
public
declaration
of
affiliation.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
the
details
of
voting
are
left
to
the
state
party
and
to
state
law,
and
it
varies
from
state
to
state.
in
some
states,
the
voter
is
handed
a
democratic
ballot;
in
some
states,
he
goes
into
the
voting
booth
and
makes
his
selection
after
having
declared,
after
he
made
the
declaration
outside
the
voting
booth.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
no.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
no.
the
state
party
would
have
to
make
arrangements
to
ensure
that
he
had
made
his
declaration
and
voted--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--separate
voting
machines
or
blocking
off
the
republican
and
independent
lines,
or
whatever
third
party--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--that's
correct.
but
again,
the
details
of
implementing
the
party
rule
are
not
dictated
by
the
national
party,
those
are
left
to
the
state--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--it's
simpler,
but
there
are
numerous
states
that
have
closed
primaries.
29
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
closed
primaries
and--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--i
think
that's
generally
the
correct
history--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
end
of
the
exercise
is
not
the
election
of
a
public
official,
the
end
of
the
exercise
is
the
selection
of
delegates
to
a
national
convention
who
are
committed
to
vote
for
particular
nominees.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
latter
is
closer
to
our
position.
in
other
words,--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--i
think
it's
a
proper
appeal
because
the
wisconsin
statute,
as
applied
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and,
i
think,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
order
was
faithful
to
the
statute's
requirements,
not
an
opinion,
but
the
order.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
think
that
the
statute
as
applied
to
the
democratic
party
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court:
the
order
of
the
wisconsin
court
effectively
requires
the
party
to
seek
delegates
chosen
in
accordance
with
the
open
primary
statute
and
in
conflict
with
the
party's
determination
about
who
ought
to
participate
in
this
process.
this
is
not
a
case,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
statute,
where
the
wisconsin
statute
or
the
court's
order
says
to
the
party,
if
you
want
to
use
our
electoral
machinery,
our
election
machinery,
you
must
permit...
you
must
permit
non-democrats
to
participate
in
the
primary
process.
there
is
a
case
instead
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
dictate
to
the
party
and
to
the
party's
convention
which
delegates
it
has
to
seat.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
believe
so.
the
wisconsin
court
order
actually
was
a
declaration.
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
had
already
taken
steps
to
obtain
an
injunction
in
new
york
where
the
convention
was
held,
had
that
been
necessary.
so
yes,
i
think
they
would
have
probably
held...
the
national
party
and
the
democratic
national
committee
were
respondents
in
the
original
action
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
i
presume,
would
have
been
held
in
contempt
had
that...
had
the
democratic
party
violated
the
order.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it
did
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
had
the
litigation
never
been
brought,
i
believe
that
the
national
party
would
have
run
an
alternate
delegate
selection
system,
or,
hopefully
with
the
cooperation
of
the
state
party,
and
a
different
slate
of
delegates
would
have
been
seated.
the
national
party,
at
the
time
the
stay
was
issued
was
unfortunately
and
regrettably
not
in
a
position
to
run
an
alternate
delegate
selection
system,
partly
because
there
wasn't
sufficient
time
and
partly
because
the
dnc
didn't
have
the
resources
to
do
it.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it's...
we
contend
that
the
wisconsin
statute
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--there
would
be
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that
sort
of
statute.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
the
case
is
not
moot,
justice
white,
because
one,
the
wisconsin
order
was
not
limited
to
the
1980
convention;
the
order
has
continuing
effect
and
would
continue
to
require
the
democratic
party
in
the
1984
convention
to
seek
delegates
selected
in
accordance
with
the
open
primary.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
sir?
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
yes,
the
order
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
42(a).
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
blue,
and
thick;
it's
the
thick
blue.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it's
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
as
you
know,
the
democratic
party
is
not
always
of
one
mind
on
many
of
the
issues
that
it
confronts.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it
is
not
a
monolith,
for
good
or
for
ill.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
the
state
party
is
content
with
the
system.
the
national
party,
however,
is
a
national
association
made
up
of
the
state
parties
of
50
states
and
recognized
entities
from
other
jurisdictions.
and
that
really
goes,
in
a
way,
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
in
this
case
named
in
cousins
v.
wigoda,
and
that
is
that
the
national
party
wishes
to
have
national
standards
that
apply
to
its
processes
for
selecting
a
nominee.
it
has
numerous
standards.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
there
is
that
risk,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
it
has
happened
on
occasion.
but
i
assume
you...
there
is
the
risk
that
the
national
convention
might
refuse
to
abide
by
the
rules
that
the
national
party
had
set
earlier
for
the
selection
of
delegates.
i
assume
that's
your
question,
and
indeed
that
happened
in
o'brien
v.
brown,
in
california.
but
that's
a
very
rare
case
indeed.
we
don't
anticipate
it
happening--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--it's
rare
for
delegates
not
to
be
seated
when
the
selection
process
otherwise
complied
with
all
the
national
party's
rules
for
selecting
the
delegates.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
the
case
is
not
moot
because
the
wisconsin
court's
order,
which
i
think
faithfully
reflects
the
wisconsin
statute
as
applied
to
the
democratic
party,
continues
to
require
the
democratic
party
to
seat
delegates
from
wisconsin
that
are
selected
in
part
by
non-democrats.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
interpret
that
as
being
generic
and
in
any
event,
as
i
said,
the
order
itself
is
consistent
with
the
wisconsin
statute
which
requires
the
national--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--i
didn't...
if
i
appeared
to
back
off
it,
i
didn't
mean
to,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--i
hope
i
didn't
say
that.
what
i
said
was--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--there's
nothing
wrong
with
an
open
primary
statute
as
applied
to
another
political
party,
specifically,
for
example,
the
republican
party
which
has
no
objection
to
a...
an
open
primary.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
exactly.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
justice
rehnquist,
the
wisconsin
court
did
not
leave
us
that
option.
the
wisconsin
court,
effectively
directs
the
party
to
seat
delegates
selected
in
accordance
with
the
open
primary
and
not
by
some
other
process.
now
the
order
stated
as
if
it
were
a
negative
order,
but
the
net
effect
of
it
is
that
it
requires
the
parties
to
seat
and--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--the
state
has
no
power,
because
when,
if
it
tries
to
do
so,
it
violates
the
parties'
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
believe
that's
quite
different,
justice
rehnquist.
even
if
the
state
had
specified
the
electors,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
could
nonetheless
specify
the
delegates
to
the
national
party's
convention
because
even
if
wisconsin
chose
that
scheme,
the
national
party
would
still
hold
a
convention
to
produce
a
nominee
to
run
for
president,
president
of
the
entire
united
states,
and
those
delegates,
the
delegates
from
wisconsin
would
still
reflect
a
set
of
rules
for
selecting
delegates
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
party's
rule.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
the
question
of
whether
and
under
what
circumstances
the
democratic
parties'
action...
state
action
is
not
presented
by
the
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
think
it
is
a
private
organization
but
this
case
is
much
different
from
the
moose
lodge
case.
this
is
not
a
case
where--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
yes,
i
understand
that,
justice
stewart.
and
that's
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is...
that's
exactly...
that's
our
view.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that's
right,
justice
marshall.
this
is
not
a
case--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--that's
right.
this
is
not
a
case
that
involves
the
question
whether
the
parties
rules
violate
an
individual's
constitutional
rights
or
whether
the
party
is
exercising
some
authority
outside
the
confines
of
the
bill
of
rights,
that's
a
different
case,
it's
not
this
one.
the
case
here
is
what
the
state's
power
is
with
regard
to
the
party,
not
what
the
party's
is
with
regard
to
some
individual.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
the
question
whether
a
national
political
party
is
purely
a
private
institution
is
one
that
i
do
not
think
has
to
be
answered
here
and
it
involves
questions
that
this
court
has
not
really
answered
in
similar
cases.
the
question
whether
the
party
is
purely
private
or
in
some
sense
it
exercises
state
action
simply
isn't
presented,
as
it
was
not
presented
in
cousins
v.
wigoda,
and
the
court
and
the
concurrence,
the
majority...
and
the
concurrence
specifically
noted
that.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
we
would
have
no
objection
to
a
wisconsin
statute
that
did
not
bind
the
democratic
party
to
accept
delegates
selected--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
feel
the
need
to
say
anything
further,
but
i'm
prepared
to
answer
questions.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
no,
it
would
not,
so
long
as
the
primary
was
an
open
primary
and
non-democrats--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
process
of
selecting
the
nominee,
not
merely
delegates
who
are
bound
to
hold
their
hands
up
to
cast
a
predetermined
vote.
although
i
might
add,
actually
the
delegates
functions
are
mightily
affected
by
the
candidate
apportioning,
because
the
candidate
gets
a
certain
number
of
members
on
the
credentials
committee,
a
certain
number
on
the
platform
committee
and
a
certain
number
on
the--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--yes,
it
was,
justice
stewart.
again--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--yes.
and
the
party
very
much
appreciated
being
able
to...
the
court's
stay,
which
was
issued
sua
sponte,
and
having
the
ability
to
make
that
decision
free
of
the
compulsion
of
the
wisconsin
court's
order,
there
simply
wasn't
enough
time
left
or
really
the
resources,
unfortunately,
for
the
party
to
go
out
and
run
an
alternate
delegate
selection
system,
the
national
party,
without
the
cooperation
of
the
state
party.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that
there
was
no
other
delegation,
it
was
impractical
for
us
to
try
to
create
one.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it
isn't
moot
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
wisconsin
court
order
as
i
mentioned
has
continuing
effect.
secondly,
the
issue
is
not
only
capable
of
repetition
but
it's
almost
virtually
certain
to
be
repeated,
because
i...
there's...
i
see
no
evidence
that
wisconsin
is
going
to
change
its
statute
and
i
see
very,
very
strong
evidence
that
the
democratic
party
is
not
going
to
change
its
democrats
only
rule.
and
furthermore,
it
will
almost
certainly
evade
review
if
the
case
doesn't...
the
issue
will
almost
certainly
evade
review
if
the
court
doesn't
decide
it
now,
because
by
the
time
the
controversy
arises,
in
the
nature
of
the
process
of
approving
delegate
selection
plans
and
so
on
before
the
convention,
the
controversy
won't
really
arise
as
it
didn't
this
time,
until
about
eight
months
before
the
wisconsin
primary
election
which
is
held
in
april,
and
about
it
a
year
before
the
convention,
as
was
the
case
this
time,
and
that
simply
isn't
enough
time
to
get
a
conclusive
final
adjudication
of
the
constitutional
issues
which
have
been
raised
here.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
if
i
understand
your
hypothesis
to
be
that
the
issue
would
not
be
necessarily
closed
versus
open
primary--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--but
the
apportionment
of
delegates--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--yes,
apportionment
of
delegates
selected
from
the
state,
but
actually
selected
to...
by
the
state
party
to
be
at
the
convention,
yes,
i
would
say
that
the
democratic
national
convention
and
the
democratic
party
could
decide
on
the
apportionment
of
delegates
from
the
state
on
the
method
of
apportionment,
and
that
if
the
state
mandated
a
different
one,
the
state
could
not
constitutionally
enforce
that
different
allocation.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
i
think
that's
correct.
and
the
fact
that
the
democratic
party--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--yes.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
it
has
guidelines
to
provide
certain
affirmative
action
steps
and
in
fact,
it
did
require
this
year
that
50
percent
of
the
delegates
are
women.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
so
long
as
there
was
a
contrary
party
rule,
yes.
now
i'm
not
addressing...
i'm
not
addressing
if
it
would
be
a...
there
may
well
be
other
constitutional
constraints
on
the
democratic
party's
choices
and
that
gets
into
a
whole
question
that's
not
presented
here,
of
whether
the
party's
action
is
a
state
action
and
so
forth
and
whether
it
can...
whether,
certain
individuals
can
be
precluded,
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
that
is
our
view,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
in
fact,
that
very
issue
was
brought
up
in
the
context
of
the
republican
party's
allocation
of
its
delegates
in
certain
states,
in
a
case
decided
by
the
d.c.
circuit
not
long
ago,
the
ripon
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
and
the
d.
c.
circuit
said
that
the,
state
party...
that
the
republican
party
had
a
right
to
determine
its
own
apportionment.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
no,
it
wasn't
quite
the
same
thing.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
yes.
because--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--yes.
i
believe
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
declaration
is
faithful
to
what
the
statute
has--
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
--while
i
can't
imagine
the
democratic
party
adopting
that
rule,
i
would
take
the
same
position.
mr.
ronald
e.
eastman
yes.
