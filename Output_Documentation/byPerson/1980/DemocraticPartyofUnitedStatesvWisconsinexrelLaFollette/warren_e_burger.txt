chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
democratic
party
of
the
united
states
v.
la
follette.
mr.
eastman,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
but
for
purposes
of
your
case
you
can
concede
that
the
state
could
do
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested.
but
that
they
haven't
tried
that
route.
chief
justice
burger
well
that's
on
the
theory
that
the
primary
is
a
substitute
for
the
party
convention,
historically,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
quasi-private
or
quasi-public.
it
isn't
like
an
election
in
that
sense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
counsel,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
burger
are
they
open
to
the
risk
that
the
national
convention
might
decline
to
seat
the
delegation
that
is
so
selected?
chief
justice
burger
wouldn't
it
be
rare
for
delegates
not
to
be
seated?
chief
justice
burger
and
you
said
the
wisconsin...
you
say
the
wisconsin
court
has
no
jurisdiction
whatever
to
tell
the
democratic
party
what
standard
should
be
followed
for
seating
delegates
to
its
convention?
or,
and
the
state
has
no
power?
chief
justice
burger
it's
made
the
final
order
here,
though.
it's
a
court
which
has
made
the
final
order.
and
yet
you
concede
that
the
state
legislature
under
the
constitution
can
specify
who
the
delegates
to
any...
to
who
the
electors
may
be.
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
burger
i
think
what
your
position
must
be,
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
through
its
courts
or
legislature,
has
no
more
authority
to
tell
the
democratic
party
which
delegates
should
be
seated
than
it
would
with
the
moose
lodge
or
the
knight's
of
columbus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
burger
primaries
and
general
election,
both?
chief
justice
burger
has
it
been
known,
mr.
attorney
general,
or
at
least
has
it
been
thought
and
said
that
sometimes
the
opposing
political
party
will
enter
the
primary
if
an
open
primary
is
available,
for
purposes
of
confusing
and
embarrassing
the
opposition?
chief
justice
burger
but
what
you're
saying
then,
is
that
the
democratic
national
convention
meeting
off
in
memphis,
tennessee
or
in
new
york
cannot
have
a
different
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
burger
what
is
the
constitutional
concern
in
a
primary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
friebert.
chief
justice
burger
what
about
the
states
which
begin
this
process
at
the
precinct
level
with
caucuses?
would
you
say
the
precinct
caucus
process
is
part
of
the
constitutional
electoral
process?
chief
justice
burger
that
the
state
could
regulate
that
the
caucuses
must
take
place
between
7
o'clock
and
10
o'clock
in
a
home
on
the
main
street
or
something
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
burger
the
state
legislature,
you
say,
may
regulate
the
caucus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
eastman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
democratic
party
of
the
united
states
against
la
follette
will
be
announced
by
justice
stewart.
