justice
stevens
mr.
eastman,
do
you
contend
the
wisconsin
statute
is
unconstitutional,
or
merely
that
the
national
party
need
not
seat
delegates
selected
pursuant
to
the
wisconsin
statute?
justice
stevens
that's
what
i
understand
it
to
be,
and
if
so,
is
it
a
proper
appeal?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
eastman,
may
i
pursue
that
subject
a
moment?
if
this
litigation
had
never
been
brought,
i
suppose
the
situation
when
the
convention
arrived
would
have
been
much
as
it
was
in
fact,
because
the
order
was
stayed,
if
i
remember
correctly.
justice
stevens
and
the
national
committee
went
ahead
and
seated
the
delegates
anyway.
justice
stevens
does
the
national
committee
really
have
much
interest
in
the
issue?
i
understand
they
want
to
be
out,
free
of
an
order,
compelling
them
to
seat
them.
but
supposing
the
litigation
had
never
been
brought,
presumably
they
would
have
just
gone
ahead
and
seated
the
delegates.
justice
stevens
right,
yes.
you
don't
contend
that
there's
anything
unconstitutional
about
the
wisconsin
statute,
do
you?
justice
stevens
well,
if
you're
ordered
to
comply
with
it,
suppose...
if
you're
ordered
to
comply
with
it,
now
we
covered
that
before
lunch,
that's
unconstitutional
under
your
view.
but
supposing
they
just
have
a
statute,
say
well
we're
going
to
elect
people
in
this
fashion
and
the
national
committee
can
take
our
delegates
or
leave
them,
as
it
chooses.
justice
stevens
mr.
eastman,
i
think
you've
answered
a
question
i
asked
you
in
two
different
ways
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
your
considered
answer.
i
understand
your
argument
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
may
not
compel
the
national
party
to
accept
the
delegates
elected
pursuant
to
an
open
primary.
but
assume
that
we
vacated
that
judgment
and
just
left
the
statute
standing
and
then
left
the
matter
so
that
you
could
either
take
them
or
leave
them,
depending
on
your
own
rules.
would
you
then
have
any
objection
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
says
that
if
we're
going
to
elect
delegates
we're
going
to
do
it
with
an
open
primary.
justice
stevens
so
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
rather
merely
as
applied
to
compelling
to
accept
their
people?
justice
stevens
mr.
la
follette,
could
i
ask
you
just
one
sort
of
basic
question?
assuming
we
agree
completely
with
you
that
it's
perfectly
proper
for
the
state
to
have
an
open
primary
form
of
election
and
that
all
the
reasons
you
advance
are
valid,
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
requires
the
national
convention
to
accept
delegates
elected
in
a
manner
that
doesn't
comply
with
their
rules?
justice
stevens
general
la
follette,
your
opponent
says
they
are
not
going
to
require
you
to
change
the
law.
they
simply
won't
seat
your
delegates.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
say
that,
mr.
friebert,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
haven't
explained
how
you
justify
the
injunction.
let
me
put
it
this
way,
it
seems
to
me
one
could
agree
with
every
word
in
justice
abrahamson's
opinion,
and
still
not
quite
understand
the
theory
on
which
she
entered
the
injunction,
on
which
the
court
entered
the
injunction.
justice
stevens
that
isn't
quite...
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
their
position.
they
said
they
are
perfectly
valid
laws,
they
just
won't
seat
your
delegates.
justice
stevens
just
as
they
did
in
cousins
v.
wigoda,
that
delegation
was
elected
pursuant
to
illinois
law
and
they
refused
to
seat
then.
justice
stevens
well
if
you're
not
concerned
with
who
the
delegates
are,
you
can't
possibly
justify
the
injunction.
justice
stevens
yes
there
was,
the
illinois
law
provided
one
method
of
election
and
the
other
slate
was
not
elected
pursuant
to
that
method.
justice
stevens
well
aren't
you
using
wisconsin
law
in
an
effort
to
circumvent
the
national
rule
in
exactly
the
same
way?
you're
not
complying
with
the
national
rule
so
you're
circumventing
it.
justice
stevens
which
complied
fully
with
the
illinois
statute.
justice
stevens
didn't
comply
with
the
parry
rule,
it's
precisely
the
same
situation
here.
justice
stevens
it's
binding
with
respect
to
who
the
delegates
would
be.
justice
stevens
mr.
friebert,
why
couldn't
the
state
interest
you
described
be
adequately
protected
by
a
statute
that
said
whoever
the
delegates
are
they
shall
vote,
at
least
on
the
first
ballot
or
on
the
second
ballot,
for
the
presidential
candidate
who
receives
the
largest
vote
in
the
primary?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
one
question.
supposing
the
wisconsin
statute
divided
by
districts,
says
that
the
person...
the
presidential
candidate
who
receives
the
most
votes
in
a
given
delegate
district,
however
they
are
apportioned,
shall
be
the
candidate
for
whom
the
delegates
from
wisconsin
shall
vote.
in
other,
words,
you
could
pick
the
delegates,
but
on
the
first
ballot
they've
got
to
vote
for
the
people
that
represent
the
majority.
would
that
comply
with
your
rules?
justice
stevens
so
the
open
primary
objective
is
not
merely
the
selection
of
delegates
but
also
the
determination
of
the
person
for
whom
they
might
vote?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
eastman,
i
suppose
you'd
take
the
same
position
if
the
democratic
party
rule
said
no
delegate
shall
be
seated
unless
his
loyalty
to
the
democratic
party
shall
be
certified
by
the
state
chairman?
