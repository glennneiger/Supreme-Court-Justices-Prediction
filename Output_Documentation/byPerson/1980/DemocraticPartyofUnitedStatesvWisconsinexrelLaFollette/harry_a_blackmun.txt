mr.
eastman,
how
many
states
do
you
know
have
open
primaries
today?
justice
blackmun
well
does
your
proposal...
what
does
your
proposal
involve;
someone
declares
his
party
affiliation
as
he
comes
into
the
polling
place,
is
that
sufficient?
justice
blackmun
and
then
what
do
you
do,
hand
him
a
democratic
ballot,
or
a
republican
whatever-it-is
that
he
declares?
justice
blackmun
so
that
he
can't
cross
over
in
the--
justice
blackmun
--if
it's
machine
voting,
he
might
cross
over
after
he
gets
into
the
cubicle.
justice
blackmun
and
then...
such
as
separate
voting
machines
for
each
party?
justice
blackmun
as
each
voter
comes
in?
justice
blackmun
no,
but
you're
making
substantial
detail.
i've
lived
through
a
couple
of
these
things;
my
home
state
used
to
have
an
open
primary.
i'm
surprised
you
didn't
name
it.
i
thought
they
still
did,
but
maybe
not.
and,
both
machines
and
otherwise.
and
it's
a
lot
simpler
with
an
open
primary
than
it
is
with
a
closed
one.
justice
blackmun
mr.
eastman,
isn't
it
a
little
unseemly
that
the
state
party
of
your
own
party
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
counsel
table
here?
justice
blackmun
i
suppose
that's
the
only
obvious
answer
you
could
give.
not
a
monolith,
in
other
words?
justice
blackmun
but
it
does
demonstrate,
that
they
are
content
with
the
wisconsin
statute
and
system?
