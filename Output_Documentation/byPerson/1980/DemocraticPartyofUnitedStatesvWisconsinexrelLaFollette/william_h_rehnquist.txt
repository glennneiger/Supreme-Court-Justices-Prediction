justice
rehnquist
mr.
eastman,
i
take
it
we
have
to
deal
here
with
the
article
ii,
section
1
provision,
each
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
shall
direct
a
number
of
electors
equal
to
the
whole
number
of
senators
and
representatives
to
which
the
state
may
be
entitled.
what
if
the
wisconsin
legislature
had
simply
provided
that
13
or
14
people
should
be
the
electors
to
the
electoral
college
in
december,
1980,
in
washington,
in
this
particular
election?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
believe
they
could
do
that?
justice
rehnquist
it's
a--
justice
rehnquist
--the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
appoint,
not
regulate
the
selection
of...
well,
what
if
the
state
just
decided
to
dispense
with
any
sort
of
intervening
elections
or
caucuses
or
anything
else
and
said,
we
hereby
appoint
john
doe,
richard
roe,
et
cetera,
as
wisconsin's
elector
to
the
electoral
college
in
december,
1980?
justice
rehnquist
but
certainly
an
act
of
the
wisconsin
legislature
that
just
named
certain
electors
would
likewise
have
all
the
objections
to
which
you
pose
to
the
wisconsin
open
primary
law,
would
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
it
would
be
dictating
to
both
parties,
it
would
be
dictating
to
both
parties,
in
effect.
justice
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
would
have
done
had
the
national
party
failed
to
comply?
would
they
have
held
the
people
in
contempt?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
not
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face,
so
to
speak,
why
isn't
this
case
moot?
justice
rehnquist
well
why
can't
the
democrats
simply
set
up
their
own
machinery
for
choosing
delegates
in
wisconsin
and
outside
of
the
state
system
and
in
full
compliance
with
the
national
democratic
standards
and
send
them
to
the
democratic
national
committee,
then?
justice
rehnquist
well
but
are
you
saying
that
the
democratic
national
committee's
action
in
various
aspects
is
not
"state
action"?
justice
rehnquist
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
say
it's
just
like
the
moose
lodge
or
the
knights
of
columbus,
which
clearly
are
private
organizations.
are
you
saying
that
the
democratic
national
committee
is
a
private
organization
in
the
same
sense?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
eastman,
i
think
you...
excuse
me.
if
a
party
is
a
purely
private
organization,
then
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
constitutional
provisions
that
don't
apply
to
it
and
very
few
that
do.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
believe,
general
la
follette,
that
it
appears
in
the
record,
but
wasn't
one
of
the
great
battles
after
the
english
or
formats
of
the
19th
century,
where
they
had
enfranchised
people
to
obtain
a
secret
ballot
because
the
landlord
simply
stood
at
the
polling
place
and
if
the
person
had
to
declare
himself
openly
and
orally
it
was
just
about
like
being
disenfranchised.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
friebert,
what
if
the
democratic
national
committee
had
never
come
into
the
wisconsin
courts,
and
the
wisconsin
primary
had
proceeded
according
to
wisconsin
law
and
then
when
it
came
time
for
credentials
hearings
or
a
seating
at
the
democratic
national
committee,
the
democratic
national
committee
simply
refused
to
seat
the
wisconsin
delegates?
do
you
think
that
would
be
permissible?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
they,
you
mean
the
democratic
national
party?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
eastman,
would
you
say
that,
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
constitutionally
prohibited
from
legislating,
allowing
a
closed
primary
as
you
want,
the
declaration
of
the
democratic
loyalty,
but
saying
that
delegates
from
the
fourth
and
fifth,
votes
from
the
fourth
and
fifth
districts
shall
be
counted
as
electing
so
many
delegates;
in
other
words,
having
a
congressional
district
apportionment?
justice
rehnquist
right.
justice
rehnquist
right.
justice
rehnquist
you
do
adhere
to
the
view
that
if
the
wisconsin
legislature
says
half
of
the
population
of
the
state
lives
in
the
lake
shore
counties
and
half
of
the
population
lives
in
the
other
half
of
the
state,
then
half
of
the
delegates
shall
be
elected
by
the
lake
shore
county
closed
declared
democrats
and
half
shall
be
elected
by
the
other
declared
democrats?
