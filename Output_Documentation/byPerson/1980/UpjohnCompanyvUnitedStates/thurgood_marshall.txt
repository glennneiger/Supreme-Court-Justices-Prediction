what
would
happen
if
you
get
two
corporations
and
one
gets
his
general
counsel
to
do
it
and
another
one
gets
its
vice
president
who
is
not
a
lawyer
to
do
the
exact
same
thing?
one's
governed
by
one
rule
and
the
other
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
next
corporation
did
the
exact
same
thing
with
a
man
who
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
bar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
question
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
questionnaire.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
client
it
would
be
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
buy
that,
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble.
i
can't
hold
you
to
it.
i
can't
hold
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
glad
to
see
somebody
else
recognize
the
difference
between
a
lawyer
and
a
member
of
the
bar.
thank
you.
