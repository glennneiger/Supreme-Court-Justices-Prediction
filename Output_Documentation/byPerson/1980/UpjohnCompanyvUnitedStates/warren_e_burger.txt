chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted,
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
upjohn
company
v.
united
states.
mr.
gribbon,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
the
first
thing
a
lawyer
should
do
when
he
is
confronted
with
a
problem
by
a
client
is
to
get
the
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
he
can't
have
any
opinion
about
the
law
until
he
has
some
facts
to
which
to
apply
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
would
have
a
tendency
to
lead
lawyers
to
write
less
and
have
long
distance
telephone
calls
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
a
lawyer
from
whom
advice
is
sought
properly
perform
his
function
if
there
isn't
a
complete
and
free
flow
of
information,
factual
material
from
the
client
to
the
attorney,
whether
it's
a
corporation,
an
individual,
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
the
primary
source
the
client
in
most
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
in
some
circumstances,
mr.
wallace,
the
lawyer
would
be
precluded
from
even
conceding
or
responding
with
an
answer
that
he
was
representing
the
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
thinking
of
a
situation
specifically
where
a
government
agent
would
come
to
a
lawyer
and
say,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
client,
naming
the
client.
and
first,
i
understand
you
are
representing
this
man
or
this
company.
is
the
lawyer
free
or
not
free
to
say,
i
will
not
discuss
anything
with
you
including
whether
i
am
or
whether
i
am
not
representing
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
surely,
many
lawyers
have
acted
on
that
assumption
that
they
would
not
respond
to
any
questions
about
whether
they
represented
a
given
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
bears
on
how
far
the
relationship
can
be
penetrated,
does
it
not?
they
can
be--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
gribbon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
upjohn
company
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
