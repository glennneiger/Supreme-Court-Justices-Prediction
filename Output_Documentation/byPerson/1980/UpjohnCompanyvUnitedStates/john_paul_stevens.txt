justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gribbon,
one
minor
detail.
did
you
give
them
the
blank
questionnaire?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no
answers
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gribbon,
supposing
when
he
got
all
through
when
his
investigation,
he
said
to
the
president,
my
advice
to
you
is
to
fire
the
ten
branch
managers.
would
the
privilege
survive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
really
inquiring
is,
how
do
we
know
whether
the
advice
that
this
executive,
who
is
both
a
lawyer
and
an
executive,
gives
is
properly
considered
legal
advice,
because
it
may
well
be
kind
of
a
blend
of
management
and
legal
advice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
just
ask
one
background
question?
you
suggest
this
is
more
or
less
the
common
law
test,
by
virtue
of
history,
am
i
not
correct
in
remembering
that
judge
kirkpatrick's
opinion
is
the
first
announcement
of
this
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
a
replacement,
or
at
the
time
it
was
being
considered
as...
an
alternative
that
was
considered
was
the
radiant
burners
test
of
no
privilege
at
all.
so
there
isn't
really
any
law
in
common
law
that
supports
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
one
case,
the
radiant
burners
case,
denied
it,
and
that
was
rejected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question...
two
kind
of
factual
questions,
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
do
you
have
the
identity
of
the
people
who
received
the
questionnaires
for
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reason
why
the
government
couldn't
have...
it
has
the
questionnaire,
i
understand.
it
couldn't
have
just
sent
the
same
questionnaire
to
all
these
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
wondering
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
presumably
they'd
be
truthful
answers;
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask,
on
the
interview
aspect
of
the
inquiry,
it's
the
government's
view,
i
gather,
that
if
these
people
had
been,
say,
grand
jury
witnesses
or
something
like
that,
but
junior
employees,
but
they
were
interviewed
after
testifying
before
a
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
corporation
as
to
what
position
to
take
in
response
to
a
pending
indictment,
something
like
that,
there'd
be
no
privilege
attached
to
those
interviews?
because
the
people,
by
hypothesis,
were
not...
the
witnesses
would
not
be
in
the
control
group.
the
fact
that
it's
a
tax
investigation
isn't
particularly
important
in
your
analysis.
the
relevant
test
is
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
apply
the
test,
mr.
wallace,
would
it
not
be
true
that
say,
you
had
an
insurance
manager
or
somebody
who
handled
personal
injury
settlements.
communications
between
him
and
the
lawyer
would
be
privileged
but
the
interview
between
the
lawyer
and
the
truck
driver
and
the
man
who
loaded
the
truck
about
what
happened
at
the
accident
scene,
all
that
would
be
open
season.
there
would
be
no
privilege.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no
privilege
would
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
no,
i
see.
there
would
not
be
attorney-client
privilege.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
would
be
just
like
third-party
witnesses
as
far
as
the
test
was
concerned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they're
not
treated
as
third-party
witnesses
in
court,
are
they?
in
court
they're
treated...
well,
they'd
have
to
be
a
managing
agent,
wouldn't
they?
