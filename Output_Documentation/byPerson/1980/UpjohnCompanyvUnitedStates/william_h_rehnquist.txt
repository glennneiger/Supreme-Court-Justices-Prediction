by
the

your
client?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gribbon,
what
if
the
general
counsel
without
the
authorization
of
the
board
simply
felt
that
there's
something
wrong
here
and
i'm
going
to
blow
the
whistle
on
this
board
because
i
think
they're
covering
up
some
stuff,
and
went
around
and
conducted
exactly
the
same
interviews?
would
you
claim
the
same
privilege
for
him
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
couldn't
rely
on
it
at
all
if
they
had
not
preserved
it
on
their
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
tension
in
more
ways
than
one
here,
isn't
there?
because
the
corporation
as
you
describe
it
is
a
very
abstract
entity
and...
the
board
of
directors
are
human
beings
who
may
have
tensions
and
conflicting
interests
themselves.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
outside
of
the
attorney-client
field
for
a
precedent,
do
you?
how
about
cardozo's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
clark,
where
he
says
that
if
the
information
communicated
suggests
fraud
or
crime,
it's
not
privileged.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
appropriate
or
necessary
that
we
fish
or
cut
bait
right
at
this
moment
in
view
of
the
wording
of
the
rules?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
choose
for
all
time
between
one
and
the
other
in
every
given
possible
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
common
law
developed
over
three
or
four
centuries
and
it
certainly
grew
by
accretion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
yours
easy
to
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
january
1976,
the
petitioner
here,
upjohn
company
learned
from
it’s
auditors
that
one
of
its
foreign
subsidiaries
had
made
payments
to
foreign
government
officials
in
order
to
obtain
business
from
that
government.
the
company
began
an
internal
investigation
into
such
and
questionable
payments.
the
investigation
was
conducted
by
the
company's
general
counsel
and
he
sought
information
in
order
that
he
could
give
the
company
legal
advise
considering
the
payments.
the
company
sent
questionnaires
seeking
information
about
the
questionable
--
questionable
payments
to
its
foreign
managers
and
counsel
conducted
interviews
with
these
managers
and
their
officials.
the
attorney
took
notes
of
the
interview.
eventually,
the
company
voluntarily
disclosed
information
about
the
questionable
payments
to
the
sec
and
to
the
irs.
the
irs
immediately
began
an
investigation
into
the
tax
consequences
of
the
payments
and
sought
to
subpoena
the
completed
questionnaires
in
counsel’s
notes
of
interviews
with
company
employees.
the
company
resisted
disclosure
of
these
materials
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
protected
from
disclosure
by
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
by
the
work-product
doctrine.
the
lower
courts'
decision
we
are
reviewing
here
held
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
did
not
apply
to
protect
the
materials
here
because
the
employees
who
had
communicated
with
counsel
were
not
in
a
position
to
control,
as
they
put
it,
a
final
decision
on
what
legal
action
the
company
might
take.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
also
held
that
the
work-product
doctrine
did
not
apply
their
proceedings
to
enforce
tax
summonses.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
court,
we
reject
the
narrow
test
applied
by
the
lower
courts
for
the
application
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
the
employees
involved
in
this
case
had
the
information
company
counsel
needed
in
order
to
inform
and
advise
the
company.
the
attorney-client
privilege
exists
to
encourage
the
communication
of
such
information
to
counsel,
so
that
counsel
can
carry
out
his
professional
mission.
if
the
purpose
of
the
attorney-client
privileges
is
to
be
served,
the
communications
involved
in
this
case
must
be
protected.
we
also
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
ruling
that
the
work-product
doctrine
did
not
apply.
the
doctrine
protects
against
disclosure
of
material
prepared
by
attorneys
in
an
anticipation
of
litigation
to
preserve
with
privacy
necessary
for
the
proper
functioning
of
counsel
in
our
adversary
system.
not
only
does
the
doctrine
apply
here
but
it
applies
with
peculiar
force.
the
materials
sought
was
counsel's
note
based
on
oral
interviews
which
this
court
has
recognized
as
being
entitled
to
special
work
product
protection
since
it
reveals
the
attorneys'
mental
process
in
evaluating
what
the
witness
is
saying.
we're
not
sure
any
showing
of
necessity
could
ever
justify
the
disclosure
of
such
work
product
but
we
leave
the
question
of
whether
adequate
necessity
has
been
shown
to
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
in
the
first
instance.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
therefore
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
