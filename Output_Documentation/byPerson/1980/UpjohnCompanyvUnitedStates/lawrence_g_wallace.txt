mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
question
before
the
court
is
how
to
accommodate
the
attorney-client
privilege
to
the
corporate
form
of
doing
business.
analytically,
at
one
logical
extreme,
the
privilege
would
not
apply
at
all
to
corporations,
because
it's
only
the
corporation
who
is
the
client
and
it
is
only
to
the
entity
that
the
lawyer
owes
his
professional
responsibility
and
the
communications
by
necessity
are
with
individuals
to
whom
the
lawyer
does
not
owe
this
kind
of
fiduciary
responsibility.
we
do
not
advocate
this
approach
to
it,
but
this
is
one
analytical,
logical
extreme.
at
the
other
logical
extreme,
all
communications
between
an
attorney
for
the
entity
and
any
employee
of
the
entity
would
be
privileged.
because
the
entity
can
communicate
only
through
its
employees,
this
would
result
in
a
much
more
expansive
scope
of
the
privilege
in
the
corporate
form
of
doing
business
than
what
we
understand
the
privilege
to
be
with
respect
to
employees
of
a
proprietorship
or
of
a
partnership
and
indeed,
what
the
court
in
hickman
v.
taylor
understood
the
scope
of
the
privilege
to
be
with
respect
to
employees
of
a
partnership.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
acting
as
an
agent.
but
there
is
considerable
ambiguity
in
the
law
about
that.
i
really
planned
to
get
to
that
a
little
bit
later
on,
but
there's
a
difference
between
acting
as
an
agent
and
communicating
what
the
client
knows
and
wishes
to
communicate.
the
classic
example
is
the
translator,
or
a
communication
from
the
agent
who
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--himself...
imparting
his
own
knowledge
that
the
client
may
not
know.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
there
has
been
much
confusion
in
analysis
about
this.
between
the
two
extremes
that
i
have
posed,
no
approach
to
accommodating
the
privilege
to
the
corporate
form
of
doing
business
is
without
some
analytical
inconsistency.
and
yet
we
think
that
a
reasonable
accommodation
should
be
made,
and
that
the
privilege
does
apply,
and
the
courts
have
strained
to
make
a
reasonable
accommodation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
under
rule
501
of
the
rules
of
evidence
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
are
to
apply
the
common
law
interpreted
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience
to
federal
question
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
metes
and
bounds.
now,
there
is
an
attraction
for
the
legal
profession,
one
might
even
say
a
temptation,
to
take
an
expansive
view
of
this
particular
privilege,
a
view
that
would
encourage
communication
as
much
as
possible
to
attorneys
and
thus
enable
them
to
improve
their
representation
of
clients,
and
incidentally
reduce
the
possibilities
that
they
may
have
to
be
in
the
capacity
of
witnesses
at
any
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
lawyer
has
to
get
information
from
whatever
sources
he
can
and
of
course--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
the
primary
source,
but
the
point
i
was
about
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
indeed
the
information
that
the
lawyer
is
able
to
secure
and
the
services
that
he
would
be
able
to
perform
for
the
client
would
be
enhanced
if
the
privilege
were
to
extend
to
third
party
witnesses
that
the
lawyer
wants
to
interview
in
doing
the
client's
business,
and
it
has
never
been
contended
that
the
privilege
extends
that
far.
our
position
is
that
the
proper
starting
point
in
approaching
the
question
of
how
best
to
accommodate
it
is
the
starting
point
that
this
court
has
used
with
respect
to
all
privileges,
and
that
is
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
every
man's
evidence
and
that
each
privilege
should
be
construed
no
more
broadly
than
necessary
to
protect
the
weighty
and
legitimate
competing
interest.
this
is
the
approach
that
has
been
used
in
construing
the
president's
executive
privilege
and
construing
privileges
asserted
on
behalf
of
the
press--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
indeed,
in
a
more
recent
opinion
this
court
said
that
the
same
principle
applies
to
this
privilege
and
to
the
legal
profession,
and
that
is
fisher
against
the
united
states.
from
this
starting
point,
and
with
a
view
toward
the
need
to
encourage
legal
advice
to
corporations
and
to
encourage
corporate
self-regulation
and
with
a
view
toward
concerns
of
the
federal
government
itself,
we
concluded
after
a
survey
of
the
views
of
a
large
number
of
government
agencies...
i
might
say,
an
unusually
large
number
in
preparing
the
brief
for
this
court...
to
ask
this
court
to
adopt
the
so-called
control
group
test
which
has
been
the
prevalent
approach
in
this
area.
and
i
might
add
that
no
agency
that
we
consulted
dissented
from
this
conclusion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
understand
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
willing
to
make
the
argument
of
whether
or
not
that
is
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
about
the
position
to
take
with
respect
to
corporations.
there
was
some
awareness
that
the
decision
here
might
affect
privilege
within
the
government,
but
it...
that's
affected
by
so
many
other
laws
at
this
point,
mr.
justice,
that
we're
not
sure
that
it
would
have
a
meaningful
impact.
in
any
event,
in
all
candor,
the
agency
that
showed
the
most
interest
in
the
question,
outside
of
the
department
of
justice,
was
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
which
is
not
concerned
about
disclosures
from
itself.
now,
the
advantages
that
we
see
in
the
control
group
test
include
in
no
small
measure
its
simplicity
and
its
flexibility,
its
adaptability
to
the
situation
of
the
particular
legal
advice
being
sought,
and
the
particular
information
being
secured.
and
we
regard
it
as
a
proper
analog
to
the
application
of
the
privilege
in
a
non-corporate
context.
speaking
of
its
simplicity,
unlike
the
other
tests
that
have
been
proposed,
where
there
seems
to
be
constant
discussion
of
possible
qualifications
or
refinements,
the
control
group
test
has
remained
unchanged
since
its
original
formulation
by
judge
kirkpatrick
in
1962
in
a
case
which
we
quoted,
page
37
of
our
brief,
the
city
of
philadelphia
v.
westinghouse
corporation.
it's
the
test
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence,
which
six
states
have
adopted
by
statute
during
the
1970s.
and
while
some
other
states
have
taken
a
different
view
in
their
judicial
decisions,
it
has
been
the
prevalent
view
in
the
federal
courts
as
well
as
perhaps
the
prevalent
view
in
the
states.
many
of
the
states
decisions
don't
speak
specifically
to
this
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the...
a
draft
originally
control
group
test
but
after
this
court's
4-to-4
affirmance
in
the
harper
case,
that
was
changed
to
not
to
try
to
resolve
it,
just
to
leave
the
question
unresolved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
way
it
went
to
congress.
i
think
directly
because
of
this
court's
decision.
indeed,
the
8th
circuit's
en
banc
decision
in
diversified
industries
in
1977
referred
to
the
control
group
test
which
that
court
was
rejecting
as
the
most
widely
used
test,
and
the
test
that
predominates.
that's
on
page
608
of
volume
572
of
the
federal
reporter,
2d,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
perhaps
that
is
the
test
that
reflects
the
common
law
at
that
time,
which
the
court
of
course
is
free
to
interpret
in
light
of
reason
and
experience
in
applying
section
501.
the
main
thing
that
has
happened
since
that
decision
of
the
8th
circuit
is
that
two
more
courts
of
appeals
have
spoken
on
the
subject.
and
both
of
them
have
adopted
the
control
group
test.
the
court
below
is
the
second
of
these.
the
first
of
the
courts
to
do
this
was
the
3rd
circuit
in
1979
in
an
opinion
by
chief
judge
seitz,
a
former
chancellor
of
the
state
of
delaware,
who
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
informed
judges
on
the
federal
bench
about
the
realities
of
corporate
life,
and
of
corporate
legal
practice.
in
our
view--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--you
are
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
not
a
law
in
common
law
but
we
have
to
under
section
501
use
whatever
common
law
has
been
developed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
other
than
what
mr.
justice
stevens
has
suggested,
the
possibility
that
there
was
no
privilege
at
all,
there
really
hadn't
been
developed
any
test
in
the
corporate
context.
indeed--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i'm
not
aware
of
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
other
than
radiant
burner
i'm
not
aware
of
early
law
on
the
question.
the
canons
of
ethics
and
most
legal
writings
have
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
you
know
who
the
client
is
and
it's
the
communications
from
the
client
that
are
privileged
and
have
given
scant
attention
to
this
problem
of
the
client
as
an
entity
other
than
to
say
that
the
lawyer's
duties
are
to
the
entity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
necessarily,
but
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the
rationale
adopted
won't
cut
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
is
correct.
it's
possible
that
the
court's
decision
here
could
be
distinguished
in
some
way
in
a
future
case,
depending
on
how
it's
written,
but
nothing
has
occurred
to
me
that
wouldn't
require
the
court
to
consider
the
rationale
of
the
two
principal
tests
that
have
been
developed,
other
than
the
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance,
which
we
have
raised.
but
we're
not
urging
the
court
to
avoid
the
principal
question
on
which
it
granted
certiorari.
we
felt
constrained
to
raise
them
in
our
analysis
of
what
was
presented
here.
now,
i'd
like
with
the
court's
permission
to
turn--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
believe
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
we
have
the
current
addresses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
not
sure
we
have
the
current
addresses.
some
of
them
are
no
longer
employed
by
the
company,
but
we
could
send
them.
but
they
would
not
be
under
legal
compulsion
to
answer
them,
nor
would
we
have
any
way
of
knowing
whether
the
answers
are
the
same
as
the
answers
that
they
gave
to
mr.
thomas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
were
answered.
there
is
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
company
has
instructed
them
not
to
disclose
anything
except
with
respect
to
those
transactions
that
the
company
has
decided
bear
on
the
company's
tax
liabilities.
the
problem
with
these
payments
is
that
for
the
most
part
they're
to
third
persons...
and
what
the
company
was
trying
to...
rather
than
to
government
officials.
and
the
company
was
trying
to
find
out,
according
to
its
testimony,
whether
those
were
legitimate
commissions
to
non-governmental
persons
or
whether
those
persons
were
in
effect
a
conduit
for
payment
to
a
public
official.
and
the
company
having
sorted
out
for
itself,
is
asking
the
internal
revenue
service
to
accept
its
judgment
about
which
ones
may
be
pertinent
to
its
tax
liability.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
the
opinion
of
the
3rd
circuit,
to
which
i
want
to
commend
the
court's
attention,
is
to
us
the
most
penetrating
opinion
written
in
this
field,
because
it
refers
to
and
responds
to
all
of
the
authorities
on
which
the
petitioners
rely
here
in
advocating
that
it's
time
for
the
control
group
test
to
be
abandoned,
and
responds,
we
think,
in
a
very
convincing
way.
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
some
excerpts
from
chief
judge
seitz's
opinion
for
the
3rd
circuit,
interspersed
with
some
comments
of
our
own.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not
relate
to
the
work
product
question,
although
work
product
is
referred
to
in
the
course
of
the
discussion.
and
the
first
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognizes
is
that
criticism
of
the
control
group
test
usually
begins
with
the
observation
that
in
the
corporate
setting
the
people
who
know
the
relevant
facts
and
the
people
who
make
the
decisions
are
seldom
the
same.
and
if
an
attorney
is
to
give
sound
advice
to
the
control
group,
he
must
secure
information
from
outside
the
control
group.
and
the
court
says,
"although
we
agree
that
an
attorney
often
needs
to
secure
information
from
lower
echelon
employees,
we
are
not
convinced
that
extension
of
the
corporation's
attorney-client
privilege
would
enhance
his
or
her
ability
to
secure
that
information.
"
"the
confidentiality
offered
to
non-control
group
employees
would
be
quite
illusory
from
their
standpoint,
because
they
have
no
control
over
the
privilege
itself.
"
"their
communications
remain
confidential
only
in
the
sense
that
they
are
not
released
to
outsiders,
and
only
as
long
as
the
corporate
control
group
desires
to
assert
the
privilege.
"
"if
the
employees
had
engaged
in
questionable
activity
the
corporation
clearly
would
have
the
power
to
waive
the
privilege
and
to
turn
the
employees'
statements
over
to
law
enforcement
officials.
"
"privilege
or
no
privilege,
lower
level
employees
would
confide
in
corporate
counsel
at
their
own
risk.
"
"conversely,
where
no
questionable
activity
is
involved,
non-control
group
employees
have
little
reason
not
to
relate
information
to
corporate
counsel,
especially
where
a
superior
has
instructed
them
to
do
so.
"
now,
this
seems
to
us
to
be
directly
relevant
to
the
usual
approach
of
trying
to
determine
whether
a
substantial
and
weighty
competing
interest
requires
a
privilege
to
be
more
broadly
construed
than
its
applicability
to
those
who
have
the
authority
to
seek
the
advice
of
counsel,
to
act
on
the
advice
that
is
sought,
and
indeed
to
waive
the
privilege.
ordinarily,
in
a
lawyer-client
relationship,
the
attorney
can
disclose
the
confidential
communication
to
no
one
else.
here
you
start
off
on
the
premise
that
it's
being
secured
in
order
to
be
disclosed
to
other
higher
officials
in
the
corporation,
or
in
this
case,
perhaps,
to
be
acted
on
by
the
general
counsel
himself
in
one
of
his
other
capacities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
what
the
american
bar
association
is
now
struggling
with
in
revising
the
code
of
ethics
that
was
adopted
as
recently
as
1970,
but
one
of
the
shortcomings
that
the
committee
working
on
them
now
has
found
is
that
it
doesn't
adequately
address
this
problem
of
who
is
the
client,
and
the
draft
now
being
circulated
includes
a
provision
for
giving
a
so-called
miranda-type
warning
to
the
employee
when
counsel
is
interviewing
the
employee
so
that
the
employee
knows
that
he's
not
really
going
to
have
the
benefits
of
the
confidential
communication.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
my
understanding
is
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
never
has
extended
to
the
fact
of
representation,
that
it
did
not
protect
from
disclosure
whether
or
not
the
attorney
represented
the
individual.
that
has
been
my
understanding.
it
isn't
a
matter
that
we
looked
into
with
reference
to
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
did,
they
were
in
error,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
as
i
say,
it's
not
a
matter
we
looked
into
with
reference
to
this
case.
the
attorney
in
this
case
is
the
attorney
for
the
corporation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
always
thought
that
it
did
not
extend
either
to
the
identity
of
the
client
or
to
the
fees,
if
i
recollect
the
law
correctly.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that's
an
arguable
question
under
the
subject
matter
test.
you
posited
the
question
under
the
subject
matter
test.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
surely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
would
certainly
want
to
argue
that
using
the
attorney
as
a
conduit
in
that
fashion
would
not
insulate
from
discovery,
what
would
otherwise
be
discoverable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
either
test
we
would
make
that
argument.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
one
has
to
inquire
who
it
is
that
has
the
authority
to
ask
for
the
legal
advice
and
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
the
control
group
with
respect
to
that
question
is
whoever
in
the
corporation
has
the
authority
to
direct
counsel
as
to
what
to
do
in
the
case,
whether
to
settle
for
a
certain
figure
or
to
litigate,
or
something.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
someone
has
directed
the
foreman
about
who
will
represent
the
corporation
in
these
circumstances
so
that
the
foreman
knows
what
to
say
to
the
person
on
the
other
side
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
control
group
has
to
be
whoever
can
make
the
decision
or
contribute
substantially
to
the
decision
with
respect
to
how
the
litigation
should
be
resolved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--not
open
season.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
work
product--
--and
that
is
a
qualifying
exception--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's...
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
an
absolute
bar.
the
work
product
privilege
is
what
was
involved
in--
qualified
privilege.
--hickman
v.
taylor,
and
that
indeed
was
interviews
of
witnesses.
they
were
called
in
the
opinion,
but
they
were--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
would
be
treated
like
third-party
witnesses.
and
indeed,
at
one
point
in
the
hickman
opinion
they
were
referred
to
as
if
they
were
third
parties,
even
though
they
were
actually
employees--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
privilege
but
only
if
he
communicated
with
someone
who
had
authority
to
act
on
his
legal
advice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
it
seems
to
be
the
implication,
and
it
isn't
something
that
we've
given
attention
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
it's
something
that
could
be
reserved
for
another
day,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
have
limited
time.
i
do
want
to
mention
that
in
the
3rd
circuit's
opinion
the
court
also
directed
its
attention
to
other
asserted
problems
with
the
control
group
test
and
answered
them
in
ways
that
all
we
can
do
is
at
this
point
commend
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
contention
that
in
some
way
the
use
of
legal
services
will
be
diminished
by
a
narrow
privilege
or
a
narrower
scope
to
the
privilege
should
be
reflected
upon
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
couch,
which
noted
that
there
is
no
privilege
at
all
for
communications
between
an
accountant
and
his
client.
my
time
has
expired.
