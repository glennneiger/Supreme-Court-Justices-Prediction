mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
writ
has
been
issued
in
this
case
to
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
6th
circuit
in
which
both
in
applying
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
the
work
product
rule
sharply
curtails
the
ability
of
a
client
to
obtain
informed
legal
advice.
i
shall
devote
the
bulk
of
my
argument
to
that
part
of
the
decision
which
limits
the
scope
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
in
the
case
of
the
corporation.
and
thereafter
i
will
briefly
discuss
what
is
left
of
the
work
product
issue
in
the
light
of
the
solicitor
general's
concession
that
the
6th
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
there
was
no
such
protection
in
response
to
a
summons
from
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
court
below
held
in
the
case
of
a
corporation,
the
attorney-client
privilege
protects
only
communications
between
a
limited
number
of
corporate
officials
and
the
corporation's
lawyer,
those
officials
being
the
ones
who
have
the
authority
to
act
for
the
corporation
upon
such
advice
as
is
given
by
the
lawyer.
in
so
limiting
the
privilege
the
6th
circuit
associated
itself
with
with
the
3rd
and
the
10th
circuits
and
disagreed
with
the
decisions
of
the
7th
and
8th
circuits.
those
circuits
have
adopted
the
so-called
subject
matter
test
pursuant
to
which
the
attorney-client
privilege
extends
to
communications
between
the
corporation's
lawyers
and
employees
of
the
corporation
who
communicate
with
the
lawyer
concerning
matters
within
the
scope
of
their
responsibilities
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
legal
advice
or
guidance.
the
decision
of
the
7th
circuit
adopting
this
subject
matter
test,
decker
v.
harper
&
row,
was
affirmed
here
almost
ten
years
ago
by
an
equally
divided
court.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
this
test,
the
subject
matter
test,
is
more
consistent
with
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
in
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
this
case
arises
in
these
circumstances.
upjohn
is
a
manufacturer
and
seller
of
pharmaceuticals
in
the
united
states
and
some
150
foreign
countries.
early
in
1976
gerard
thomas,
upjohn's
general
counsel,
who
is
also
a
director
and
officer
of
the
company,
was
informed
by
the
company's
independent
accountants
that
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
some
of
upjohn's
foreign
affiliates
had
made
payments
to
or
for
the
benefit
of
foreign
governmental
officials
in
the
promotion
of
upjohn
business.
mr.
thomas
with
the
advice
of
outside
counsel
and
with
the
full
support
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
set
about
conducting
an
investigation
to
put
himself
in
a
position
to
render
legal
advice
to
the
corporation
concerning
all
aspects
of
these
payments,
including
the
possibility
of
civil
and
criminal
litigation.
the
investigation
that
mr.
thomas
and
outside
counsel
conducted
consisted
really
of
two
parts.
one
was
a
questionnaire
prepared
by
them
which
was
sent
to
some
53
managers
of
upjohn's
foreign
affiliates
asking
them
to
put
down
on
paper
whatever
knowledge
they
had
about
possible
payments
to
or
for
the
benefit
of
foreign
governments.
each
of
these
men
was
advised
that
his
response
would
be
treated
as
confidential
and
to
this
day
it
has
been
so
treated.
now,
the
second
part
of
the
investigation
consisted
of
interviews
conducted
by
mr.
thomas
and
outside
counsel
of
some
86
employees
of
upjohn
and
its
subsidiaries
which
had
responsibility
of
one
kind
or
another
with
respect
to
payments
made
in
foreign
countries.
some
of
those
were
within
the
united
states
and
some
of
them
were
outside
the
united
states.
the
interviewing
lawyers
made
handwritten
notes
during
the
course
of
those
interviews.
the
record
shows
that
those
notes
reflect
factual
information
obtained
from
the
employees
as
well
as
the
lawyers'
impressions,
conclusions,
opinions,
and
speculations
at
the
time.
shortly
after
this
investigation
was
completed,
upjohn
filed
a
form
8-k
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
described
in
generic
terms
without
naming
countries
or
specific
amounts
that
there
had
been
some
payments.
that
was
the
last
heard
from
the
sec.
at
no
time
did
the
sec
investigate
or
charge
any
kind
of
securities
act
violations
on
the
part
of
upjohn.
now,
a
copy
of
this
report
was
simultaneously
submitted
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
thereupon
the
service
commenced
an
investigation
of
upjohn--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--it
was
submitted
by
my
client.
upjohn
submitted
it
to
the
internal
revenue
service
at
the
same
time
or
simultaneously
with
the
submission
to
the
sec.
the
revenue
service
very
shortly
thereafter
commenced
an
investigation
of
the
tax
years
that
were
involved
in
this
report
and
at
the
very
outset
of
its
investigation,
before
any
witnesses
had
been
interrogated,
any
documents
examined,
a
special
agent
served
upon
mr.
thomas
the
summons
in
question
here.
that
summons
specifically
asked
for
production
of
the
questionnaires
that
had
been
obtained
from
upjohn's
employees
and
for
all
of
the
notes
of
interviews
conducted
by
upjohn.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they're
both
work
product
and
both
covered
by
the
privilege.
both
work
product,
because
they
were
done
in
contemplation
of
litigation.
at
this...
and
one
of
the
magistrates
so
found
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
corporation
is
the
beneficiary.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
client;
the
corporation.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
it
is
the
corporation
and
mr.--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--only
the
client
can
assert
the
privilege.
and
the
client
can
reject
it,
waive
it,
or
do
anything
he
wants
to--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--the
lawyer
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
work
product.
there
is
that
difference.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
on
that
one.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
record
shows
it
to
this
extent,
at
the
time
the
summons
was
issued
some
25
of
the
86
interviewees
had
been
talked
to
by
the
service.
i
am
informed
that
since
that
time
approximately
20
more
have
been
talked
to,
so
that
a
number,
but
less
than
half,
have
been
interrogated
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
they
should
have.
they
apparently
are
not
satisfied
that
they
have
found
a
way,
and
this
is
really
the
point
i
want
to
make
here,
that
during
the
course
of
this
investigation
and
before
an
action
was
filed
in
court
to
enforce
the
summons,
upjohn
cooperated
with
the
internal
revenue
service
and
really
gave
them
everything
they
could
reasonably
ask
for
except
the
questionnaires
and
the
lawyers'
notes,
and
responded
to
almost
300
document
requests.
they
gave
them
a
list
of
the
people
who
had
been
interviewed
and
had
submitted
questionnaires,
told
them
what
their
positions
were,
cooperated
in
permitting
them
to
be
examined.
on
one
point
they
did
have
a
difference
with
the
revenue
service.
that
is,
upjohn's
lawyers
took
the
position
that
they
instructed
their
witnesses
not
to
respond
to
questions
that
did
not
have
an
impact
on
upjohn's
united
states
income
tax
returns.
now,
the
revenue
service
never
did
pursue
that
matter.
they
never
sought
the
summons
directed
to
the
witness
and
indeed
subsequently
the
service
in
a
published
opinion
just
really
acquiesced,
substantially,
in
that
position,
that
is
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
something
that
has
to
do
with
u.s.
income
taxes.
ultimately,
of
course,
this
action
was
filed
in
court
seeking
to
enforce
the
summons
directed
at
the
questionnaire
and
the
interview
notes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
they
have
the
blank
questionnaire
and
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--no
answers.
the
district
court
adopted
the
view
of
a
magistrate
to
whom
he
had
referred
this
matter.
which
held
that
the
control
group
test
should
apply
as
far
as
the
attorney-client
privilege
was
concerned,
and
further
that
none
of
the
people
who
had
been
interviewed
or
sent
questionnaires
were
within
the
control
group.
he
also
found
that
there
had
been
a
showing
of
need
on
the
part
of
the
service
for
the
work
product
and
directed
that
all
of
the
interviews
and
questionnaires
be
turned
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
finding
of
the
district
court
and
the
magistrate
so
far
as
the
control
group
test
was
concerned.
it
did
remand
for
a
determination
as
to
whether
any
members
of
this
group
could
be
regarded
as
within
the
control
group.
so
far
as
the
work
product
is
concerned,
in
a
footnote
it
rather
cursorily
said,
there
is
no
work
product
when
it
comes
to
answering
a
summons
from
the
internal
revenue
service.
now,
that
is
the
portion
of
the
opinion
which
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded
is
in
error.
now,
on
brief...
i'll
treat
this
briefly...
the
solicitor
general
has
tendered
two
reasons
why
he
says,
despite
the
grant
of
the
writ
the
court
should
not
resolve
the
scope
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
i
submit
that
neither
of
these,
neither
of
which
was
mentioned
in
his
acquiescence
in
the
grant
of
the
writ
that
neither
of
them
has
merit.
it
is
now
urged
that
the
investigation
conducted
by
mr.
thomas,
upjohn's
general
counsel,
with
the
assistance
of
outside
counsel,
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
legal
advice.
now,
this
contention
was
not
even
advanced
by
any
of
the
government
people
in
the
courts
below.
the
magistrate
found,
as
did
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
put
mr.
thomas
in
the
position
to
render
legal
advice
to
the
corporation
with
respect
to
all
of
these
matters.
and
that
finding
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
and
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
don't
think
the
privilege
would
apply.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
when
he's
acting
in
his
legal
capacity.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
not
in
non-legal
capacities.
now
this...
he
can
have
some
non-legal
duties.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case,
when
the
chairman
says
to
him,
look,
this
may
be
troublesome.
go
out
and
find
out
what
you
can
about
it
and
tell
us
what
our
legal
situation
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no...
and
advice.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
conceivably,
at
least
as
far
as
human
beings
are
concerned--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--but
i
think
that
mr.
thomas
as
a
trained
lawyer
and
the
company's
chief
lawyer,
particularly
with
the
assistance
of
outside
counsel,
was
in
a
far
better
position
to
ask
the
right
questions
and
to
get
the
answers,
and
to
formulate
what
was
necessary
for
him
to
give
the
corporation
truly
decent
legal
advice.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
were
factual,
largely,
but
inquiries
as
to
when
did
you
do
it,
who
was
present,
were
you
aware
of
the
laws,
things
of
that
kind,
the
very
things
that
a
lawyer
would
do
when
a
client
walks
into
the
office
and
says,
i
may
be
in
trouble
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
but
i
don't
think
they
do
it
as
well,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
the
privilege
has
been
given
to
the
lawyer
and
not
to
the
financial
adviser.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
that's
a
preliminary
question,
but
in
asking
him
what
he
does
he
maybe
comes
up
with
something.
well,
i
was
there,
i
wasn't
there,
so-and-so
was
there,
three
other
people
were
there.
in
all
legal
investigations
there
are
factual
inquiries.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
or
any
opinion
he
has
about
the
law
without
the
necessary
facts
isn't
worth
very
much.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
if
he
was
acting
for
the
corporation
and
i
think
in
the
case
you
have
given
he
would
be
acting
for
the
best
interests
of
the
corporation,
i
think
the
corporation
would
have
the
privilege.
now,
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
waive
it,
but
the
corporation
would
have
the
privilege
for
whatever
materials
and
whatever
opinions
and
whatever
impressions
he
gathered
with
respect
to
his
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
the
indications
are
that
in
that
situation
where
a
senior
official
not
a
lawyer
did
the
job
that
no
privilege
would
attach.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
more
than
a
member
of
the
bar?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
a
trained
lawyer.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
but
i
say...
well,
it
might
be
or
it
might
not.
that's--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--well,
if
you'd--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--if
a
finance
president
can
do
exactly
the
same
job
that
a
trained
lawyer
can
do,
then
i
have
to
go
along
with
your
answer.
but
the
theory
on
which
the
privilege
has
been
there,
the
theory
on
which
lawyers
work
is
that
they
bring
some
insight,
they
bring
some
skill
to
this
matter,
in
developing
the
facts
and
in
forming
opinions
that
can't
be
done
by
the
personnel
director
or
by
the
financial
vice
president
or
even
by
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--i
think
the
privilege
would
survive
as
to
the
communications.
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
privilege
on
the
advice,
fire
the
10
managers.
but
i
think
on
the
communications
that
the
managers
i
presume
you're
speaking
of,
your
honor,
may--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--well,
i
suppose
that's
probably
true
even
if
an
outside
counsel
had
done
it
entirely.
we're
not
in
airtight
compartments.
but
in
this
case,
where
there
clearly
were
legal
problems,
not
only
domestic
tax
problems,
sec
problems,
shareholder
suits,
but
local
problems
in
the
country
in
which
they
were
operating,
you
clearly
needed
a
trained
lawyer
to
find
the
facts
and
assess
them.
and
that's
what
mr.
thomas
did.
i
suppose
the
ultimate
answer
to
what
you're
suggesting
is
an
in
camera
examination
by
a
judge
to
see
whether
the
matters
that
were
here
are
privileged
or
not.
i
think
most
judges
prefer
not
to
do
that
and
i
think
in
this
case
it
wasn't
necessary
and
it
wasn't
done.
but
on
the
face
of
it,
what
mr.
thomas
assisted
by
outside
counsel
was
doing
was
a
lawyer's
job
and
not...
he's
not
a
financial
man
anyway.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
government
now
feels
that
they'd
like
to
back
away
from
the
scope
question
by
saying
it
wasn't
legal
advice.
that's
a
rather
late
entry
in
the
matter
and
i
submit
that
it
is
clearly
on
this
record
in
both
the
courts
below
and
the
magistrate,
who
were
not
particularly
sympathetic
to
upjohn's
position,
assumed
and
found
that
it
was
legal
advice.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
they're
probably
entitled.
i
believe
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
they
can
make
almost
any
kind
of
an
argument
of
this
kind.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
necessarily.
it's
just
another
ground.
i
raise
it
because
i
think
their
tardiness
in
bringing
it
forth
is
a
very
good
indication
of
the
validity
of
the
argument
that
they're
putting
to
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
they
didn't,
they
didn't
preserve
the
matter
of
whether
it
was
legal
advice.
that
came
into
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
in
the
respondent's
brief.
now,
the
waiver
point,
the
second
point,
was
made
by
the
government
below
but
it
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
second
reason
they
have
suggested
for
not
getting
to
the
scope
of
the
privilege
is
that
upjohn
by
cooperating
with
the
internal
revenue
service
and
giving
them
various
facts
regarding
these
payments
waived
the
privilege.
and
to
that
one,
the
law
is
clear
that
it
is
only
when
you
give
up
communications
that
you
are
in
a
position
to
waiver,
and
not
simply
when
you
give
facts
that
may
have
been
disclosed,
may
have
been
obtained,
even
in
the
course
of
an
investigation.
but
on
that
one
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
against
them,
and
there
was
nothing
in
their
response
to
the
petition
for
cert
which
said
anything
about
that
point.
in
that
respect,
the
lower
federal
courts
have
recently
in
a
number
of
opinions
said
that
where
a
corporation
or
anybody
else
is
voluntarily
cooperating
with
the
law
enforcement
authorities,
that
that
in
and
of
itself
would
not
be
regarded
as
a
waiver
of
whatever
privilege
that
they
might
have.
but,
basically,
the
waiver
comes
down
to
waiving
something
that
was
communicated,
and
that
wasn't
done
here.
i
submit,
therefore,
that
the
court
should
proceed
to
resolve
this
matter
of
the
scope
of
the
privilege
which
has
bred
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
for
about
20
years
now.
and
while
this
case
involves
a
corporation,
i
submit
there
is
no
reason
in
principle
why
what
is
decided
here
should
not
be
equally
applicable
to
any
other
organization
whose
structure
is
such
that
many
people
can
act
for
it
and
bind
it,
but
only
a
relatively
few
are
able
to
make
the
decisions.
now,
examples
of
such
organizations
would
be
agencies
of
the
federal
government,
labor
unions,
fraternal
organizations.
this
point
is
particularly
emphasized
in
the
brief
filed
here
on
behalf
of
the
federal
bar
association,
which
points
out
that
agencies
of
the
federal
government
will
be
handicapped
in
their
ability
to
carry
on
if
this
control
group
test
as
adopted
by
the
lower
court
is
to
be
adopted
by
this
court.
it's
been
generally
agreed
that
the
justification
for
the
privilege
is
to
promote
observance
of
the
law
and
effective
administration
of
justice.
it
does
this
by
permitting
attorneys
to
gain
and
become
fully
informed
of
the
relevant
facts.
as
this
court
earlier
this
year
in
the
trammell
case,
in
discussing
the
attorney-client
privilege,
said,
that
the
basis
for
it
is
to
permit
the
lawyer
to
know
everything
about
the
client's
reasons
for
seeking
representation
if
his
professional
mission
is
to
be
carried
out.
corporations...
certainly
no
less
and
i
submit,
to
a
greater
extent
than
individuals...
require
legal
advice.
most
of
the
business
of
this
country
is
conducted
by
corporations.
they
are
daily
met
with
a
maze
of
laws
and
regulations.
i
would
note
that
the
interest
of
the
bar
which
is
shown
here
by
briefs
filed
in
support
of
petitioners'
position
should
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
the
scope
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
merely
a
convenience
for
lawyers
in
the
practice
of
their
profession.
if
the
control
group
test
were
to
be
adopted,
i
am
sure
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
professional
frustration
on
the
part
of
lawyers
in
trying
to
advise
corporations.
but
the
real
losers,
if
that
test
is
applied,
is
not
going
to
be
the
lawyers.
it's
the
clients
who
need
legal
guidance,
corporations,
government
agencies,
and
other
organizations
of
that
kind
where
the
authority
is
greatly
diffused
and
yet
where
individuals
without
authority
can
certainly
bind
the
corporation.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
can't
say
certainly
that
it
would
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
everything
they
do
in
advising
their
client
is
going
to
be
turned
over
to
their
adversary,
it's
just
human
nature
that
they're
going
to
be
more
careful,
which
is
unfortunate.
they
should
be
candid
at
all
times.
the
ethics
call
for
them
to
be
candid.
and
what's
going
to
happen
if
their
intimate
conversations
with
clients
and
from
the
lawyer's
point
of
view,
these
employees,
whether
they're
decision
makers
or
not,
are
clients,
because
they
are
giving
them
facts
that
are
necessary
for
the
lawyer
to
have
in
order
to
advise
the
corporation.
two
reasons,
basically,
as
i
understand
it
in
all
that
has
been
written
about
the
control
group
test
since
judge
kirkpatrick
first
set
it
out
about
20
years
ago,
two
reasons
appear
to
be
what
come
forward
as
the
reason
why
the
control
group
test
should
be
adopted.
first
of
these
is
simply
that
there's
no
necessity
for
it.
it
is
argued
that
corporate
employees,
unlike
other
individuals,
will
speak
candidly,
voluntarily,
whether
there's
a
privilege
or
not.
they
don't
have
the
apprehensions
of
ordinary
individuals,
or
if
they
do,
they
will
subordinate
them
to
the
will
of
the
superior
officer.
now,
i
think
one
looks
back
at
the
privilege
itself
insofar
as
an
individual
is
concerned,
it
probably
never
could
be
established
that
in
fact
the
privilege
is
necessary
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
be
candid
and
frank
with
their
lawyers.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
apart
from
the
privilege
which
would
indicate
such
candor.
on
the
other
hand
experience
shows
that
many
people
do
not
speak
candidly.
for
a
couple
of
centuries
we
have
embraced
the
notion
that
it
is
helpful
not
to
the
individuals
involved
but
to
the
effective
administration
of
justice
to
encourage
people,
all
kinds
of
people,
to
be
completely
candid
by
letting
them
know
that
what
they
say
to
their
lawyer
is
not
going
to
be
used
the
next
day
against
them.
so
therefore,
i
think
the
no
necessity
argument
really
is
without
merit.
it
is
true,
as
the
proponents
of
the
control
test
urge,
that
the
employee
does
not
get
complete
protection.
the
protection
the
client
protects,
the
privilege
is
not
his,
it's
the
corporation's.
that
is
true,
of
course,
not
only
of
the
subordinate
employees
but
also
of
the
management
employees.
and
just
because
they're
management
today
doesn't
mean
that
they're
going
to
be
management
tomorrow,
because
the
directors
are
not
going
to
waive
that
privilege.
the
privilege
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
but
in
this
respect
the
employees
are
in
this
position
of
tension
between
their
individual
likes
and
dislikes
and
those
of
the
organizations
to
which
they
belong,
but
it's
not
at
all
unique--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--i
think
that's
right.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
it
was
so
abstract,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
different
people
that
are
involved
and
ultimately,
i
presume,
the
shareholders.
and
in
some
instances
shareholders
have
come
in
and
waived
the
privilege.
that
isn't
so
likely
in
a
big,
publicly
held
corporation,
but
it's
not
impossible.
and
certainly
the
directors,
certainly
a
new
management
can
come
in,
so
that
on
this
ground
there
is
really
no
solid
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
subordinate
employees
who
fairly
frequently
will
have
the
facts
that
are
necessary
to
give
informed
information,
and
the
top
management
people.
neither
group
has
complete
protection
in
the
way
that
an
individual
does.
but
they
do
have
some
protection,
and
experience
shows
that
it
has
been
exceedingly
helpful
in
obtaining
their
cooperation
and
experience
shows
that
in
most
instances
the
corporation
does
not
lightly
waive
that
privilege.
it
behaves
as
upjohn
is
behaving
here,
zealously
guarding
the
privilege
of
some
80
employees
throughout
the
world.
the
second
argument
that
is
made
for
the
control
group
test
is
something
in
the
nature
of
saying
that
it
hides
facts
from
discovery
and
it
also
enables
the
top
management
to
close
its
eyes
to
disagreeable
facts.
now,
as
to
the
discovery
argument,
i
submit,
though
it
has
often
been
made
it
is
without
merit,
because
the
privilege
does
not
hide
facts
from
discovery.
indeed,
rule
33
of
the
federal
rules
requires
that
a
corporation
go
on
out
and
get
all
the
facts
that
all
of
its
employees
have,
so
that
if
you
work
under
the
rules
you
can
get
all
these
facts.
all
that
is
hidden,
all
that
is
kept
from
disclosure,
is
the
communication.
indeed,
in
this
case
the
internal
revenue
service--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--generally
speaking...
yes,
on
the
theory
that
the
lawyer
can't
really
give
the
advice
without
incorporating
some
of
the
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
the
way
that
we
would
have
it
interpreted
here.
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
in
this
case,
rather
than
hindering
the
internal
revenue
service
in
its
efforts,
what
upjohn
has
given
to
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
result
of
this
precautionary
investigation
that
it
undertook,
has
given
them
an
ideal
road
map
to
the
repositories
of
the
information.
it
hasn't
given
them
the
lawyers'
analysis
of
the
facts,
or
the
impressions
they
had
but
it
has
certainly
given
them
everything
short
of
that,
and
in
most
instances
that's
one
of
the
risks
that
a
corporation
takes
when
it
embarks
on
an
investigation
of
this
sort.
now,
so
far
as
insulating
the
top
management
from
disagreeable
facts,
i
submit
that
that
is
sheer
speculation.
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
in
this
case,
there's
no
evidence
in
any
other
case
that's
been
cited
that
that
is
likely
to
be
the
fact.
it's
true
that
the
top
management
doesn't
know
all
the
facts
of
corporate
actions.
but
that
isn't
the
result
of
the
privilege
or
the
lack
of
the
privilege.
that
reflects
the
breadth
and
complexity
of
the
modern
corporation's
activities.
and
surely
there
may
be
some
changes
in
corporate
governments;
it's
been
under
discussion
for
a
long
time.
but
i
would
submit
that
whatever
changes
are
made
in
the
relations
between
shareholders,
directors,
public
bodies,
the
public
interest
is
still
going
to
require
that
observance
of
the
law
and
the
efficient
administration
of
the
justice
are
best
served
by
having
a
corporation
get
a
full
opportunity
to
have
informed
legal
advice.
for
all
the
reasons
i've
submitted,
the
subject
matter
test
rather
than
the
control
group
test
stands
the
best
chance
of
achieving
those
objectives.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
may
it
please
the
court:
i
should
like
to
remark
on
two
matters
covered
by
opposing
counsel.
first,
mr.
justice
white,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
was
law
before
radiant
burners
and
judge
kirkpatrick's
opinion.
in
1950
judge
wyzanski
in
the
united
shoe
machinery
case,
a
characteristically
scholarly
opinion,
enunciated
the
subject
matter
test,
and
as
far
as
i
know
it
was
never
questioned.
it
was
taken
to
be
the
law
thereafter.
judge
kirkpatrick
in
the
early
60s
articulated
this
test,
and
i
think
the
problem
with
it
is
that
he
made
the
assumption
that
the
subordinate
employees
are
not
part
of
the
corporation,
they
are
witnesses.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
don't
think
he
had...
if
it
was
there?
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
whether
he
distinguished
it
or
not.
he
had
radiant
burners
in
front
of
him,
but
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
was
well
publicized
and
was
really
hornbook
law
at
that
time
until
judge
kirkpatrick's
decision
came
along.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
he
took
the
view
that
anybody
outside
the
control
group
was
simply
a
witness
or
an
observer
and
should
be
treated
that
way.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
just
an
incorrect
view.
these
people
that
mr.
thomas
and
outside
counsel
interviewed
are
the
actors,
they're
the
participants.
it
isn't
the
control
group
back
in
kalamazoo
that's
going
to
know
anything
about
this
matter
if
it's
ever
litigated.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
i
believe
there'd
been
very
little.
i
think
it
has
simply
been
assumed
that
when
you
spoke
with
a
client,
anybody
who
was
a
part
of
the
client
was
entitled
to
have
the
privileged
communication.
and
the
employees
were
required
to--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--not
really...
he
more
or
less
did.
it
was
put
to
him
in
the
course
of
a
discovery
proceeding
in
a
major
antitrust
case,
and
then
he
resolved
it,
and
i
think
it
was
consistent
with
what
had
been
in
the
law
before
then.
now,
it
is
this
distinction
of
who
is
the
client
and
who
is
the
witness
or
observer
that
i
think
is
basically
incorrect
in
the
control
group
test,
because
i
don't
think
it
meets
the
question
that
the
lawyer
has
got
to
be
completely
informed
and
the
only
way
he's
going
to
be
informed
is
by
talking
with
those
who
were
doing
the
questioned
action--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
--it
has,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
agents
of
an
individual
are
covered
by
the
privilege.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
employees?
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
there
are
cases,
they
do
mix
up
the
work
product
with
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
attorney-client
privilege?
yes,
your
honor.
the
ordinary
master-servant
relationship.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
code
of
evidence
came
out
that
way
without
very
much
discussion
and
has
been
adopted
without
very
much
discussion.
the
reason
cases
in
the
state
courts
now
deal
with
this
matter
and
tend
very
strongly
to
go
to
the
subject
matter
test
as
being
more
responsive
to
the
purposes
of
the
privilege.
let
me
finally
comment,
counsel's
contention
that
the
control
group
test
is
simple
and
easy
to
apply
couldn't
be
more
misleading.
it
is
dreadfully
difficult
to
apply,
because
until
after
the
fact
you
don't
know
who
is
in
the
control
group.
there
are
cases
that
say
a
vice
president
is
and
cases
that
say
a
vice
president
isn't.
and
as
long
as
it
is
unpredictable,
like
that,
you've
got
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
assume
that
very
few
people
are
going
to
be
in
there.
for
predictability,
the
subject
matter
test
has
all
the
advantages.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
a
complex
subject.
there
are
a
lot
of
tantalizing
questions,
but
i
think
as
a
test
it
is
far
easier,
far
more
predictable
than
the
control
group
test.
in
closing,
your
honor,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
i
think
justice
stevens'
questions
about
why
the
internal
revenue
service
didn't
go
after
the
people
who
were
interviewed
and
who
signed
these
questionnaires
really
discloses
what
the
internal
revenue
service
is
doing
here.
they're
not
interested
in
the
facts,
they
either
have
them
or
they
can
get
them.
what
they
want
is
the
lawyer's
input.
and
that's
what
we're
fighting
about
here.
