justice
stewart
is
it
your
submission,
mr.
gribbon,
that
both
items
requested
were
work
product?
justice
stewart
i
know
we're
part
in
that
aspect
of
the
case
now.
justice
stewart
i
know
we're
talking
now
about
the
privilege,
not
about
work
product.
justice
stewart
and
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
quite
apart
from
what
the
scope
of
the
privilege
may
be
in
this
context
or
any
other,
who
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
privilege?
justice
stewart
the
client?
justice
stewart
not
the
lawyer,
the
client?
justice
stewart
so
only
the
client
would--
justice
stewart
--but
the
lawyer
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
work
product?
justice
stewart
right.
all
right.
mr.
gribbon,
while
we
have
you
interrupted,
does
the
record
show
how
many
of
the
interviewees
have
been
talked
to
by
the
government?
justice
stewart
if
mr.
thomas,
even
though
he'd
gone
to
law
school
were,
say,
vice
president
in
charge
of
personnel,
and
had
sent
out
this
questionnaire,
would--
justice
stewart
--so
when
does
it
apply?
justice
stewart
not
to
any--
justice
stewart
--well,
tell
us
what
the
factual
situation
is.
or
his
personal
situation
is.
justice
stewart
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry,
wasn't
it?
and
that
could
have
been
delegated,
at
least
arguably,
just
as
well
to
the
vice-president
in
charge
of
finance?
justice
stewart
even
though
that
vice
president
might
be
a
member
of
the
bar
somewhere,
he
wouldn't
be
acting
as
a
lawyer.
he
was
getting
factual
information.
justice
stewart
weren't
they
factual
inquiries?
justice
stewart
other
people
might
do
it
too.
justice
stewart
what
did
you
do,
and
when
did
you
do
it?
justice
stewart
the
privilege
generally
covers
both
the
communications
from
the
client
to
the
lawyer
as
well
as
the
advice
that
the
lawyer
gives
the
client,
isn't
that
correct?
it's
a
two-way
communication
between
the
two,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
without
having
factual
knowledge.
so
the
privilege,
quite
apart
again
from
the
particular
scope
of
the
privilege
with
respect
to
a
corporate
client,
the
privilege
generally
covers
the
two-way
communications
between
lawyer
and
client?
justice
stewart
doesn't
the
privilege
extend
to
any
agent
of
a
client
who's
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
client?
justice
stewart
imparting
his
own
impressions.
justice
stewart
we're
dealing
here
only
with
a
proposed
evidentiary
rule
in
the
federal
courts.
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
and
that's...
those
are
the
metes
and
bounds
of
our
inquiry.
justice
stewart
i
suppose
whatever
evidentiary
rule
is
established
in
this
case
would
be...
arguably,
at
least,
equally
applicable
to
a
governmental
agency,
wouldn't
it,
federal
governmental
agency?
justice
stewart
well,
wouldn't
it
be?
that's
a
question.
justice
stewart
i'm
not
sure
either.
justice
stewart
but
it
wasn't
in
that
connection
that
you
conducted
an
investigation
or
an
inquiry
among
the
various
agencies?
