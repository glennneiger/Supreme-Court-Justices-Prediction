unknown
speaker
which
the
principal
may
not
know.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
the
way
it
went
to
congress?
unknown
speaker
and
you'd
say
that,
mr.
wallace,
under
either
test?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
this
question
arises,
i
suppose,
most
frequently,
or
at
least
frequently,
not
in
the
international
context
of
this
case
but
rather
in
the
more
mundane
case
of
a
truck
owned
by
the
corporation
getting
involved
in
an
automobile
accident
or
a
products
liability
claim
or
something
like
that,
in
which
the
lawyer
is
going
to
talk
to
the
employees
of
the
corporation
that
are
directly
involved,
and
probably
the
top
officers
or
directors
of
the
corporation
don't
know
or
care
anything
about
that
particular
lawsuit.
how
would
your
test
apply
there?
how
would
either
test
apply
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lawyer
represents
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
will
be
liable
under
respondeat
superior
if
it's
found
that
its
agent
was
liable
in
driving
the
truck,
or
if
its
product
was
what
caused
harm.
unknown
speaker
well,
nobody
directs...
the
foreman,
the
man's
foreman
just
said,
our
lawyer
is
joe
smith,
call
him,
mr.
joseph
smith.
nobody
who's
very
high
in
the
corporation
ever
knows
about
this,
or
cares
about
it.
unknown
speaker
presumably
somebody
in
the
control
group
or
the
control
group
generally
decided
to
hire
mr.
joseph
smith
as
its
general
counsel,
smith
&
jones.
but
from
then
on,
the
general
counsel
just
does
that
kind
of
work
for
the
corporation.
and
many
of
these,
much
of
its
legal
work,
would
be
in
cases
about
which
the
higher
echelon
control
group
would
not
know
or
care.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
just
wanted
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
wanted
to
find
out
what
your
position
was.
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
judge
wyzanski's
opinion?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gribbon,
when
you
talk
about
decisions
in
the
federal
court.
but
i
suppose
that
there
must
have
been
a
lot
of
state
litigation
involving
these
questions?
unknown
speaker
did
judge
wyzanski
treat
it
as
if
he
was
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
gribbon,
has
there
been
some
litigation,
either
in
the
state
or
federal
courts,
where
in
an
individual
proprietorship
when
the
same
question
comes
up
about
employees
of
the
individual
proprietorship?
unknown
speaker
or
employees
of
a
partnership?
unknown
speaker
or
agents'
employees?
unknown
speaker
say
there's
an
individual
proprietorship
and
he
has
an
employee
that
drives
a
truck,
who
gets
in
a
wreck,
and
the
individual
proprietor
tells
a
lawyer
to
go
out
and
investigate
that,
and
he
does.
and
the
truck
driver
is
told
to
cooperate
with
the
lawyer,
and
he
does.
now,
are
there
cases
like
that
around
saying
it's
privileged?
unknown
speaker
but
are
there
attorney-client
privilege
cases
that
say
that's
privileged?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
that
the
uniform
rules
came
out
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
