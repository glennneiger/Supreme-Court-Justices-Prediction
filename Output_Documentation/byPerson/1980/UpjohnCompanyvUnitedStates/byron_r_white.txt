but
this
is...
this
wasn't
the
rationale
below,
i
take
it,
whether
it
was
legal
advice
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government
would
like
to
make
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
make,
as
a
respondent
entitled
to
make
this
argument?
or
would
it
change
their
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
it
would
expand
their
relief.
justice
white
did
the
proposed
rules
of
evidence
for
the
federal
courts
prior
to
their
amendment
in
congress
take
a
position
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
test
or
was
there
before
that,
before
the
control
group
test
was
invented?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
been
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
direct
itself
to
both
the
privilege
and
to
the
work
product?
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
wallace,
under
the
subject
matter
test,
if
the
lawyer
makes
the
investigation
and
collects
the
statements
from
the
witnesses
and
then
writes
an
opinion
letter
to
a
member
of
the
control
group
who
asked
him
to
do
it,
and
who
had
told
the
employees
to
cooperate,
he
writes
a
letter
but
he
attaches
all
the
statements.
are
those
statements
privileged
in
the
hands
of
the
member
of
the
control
group
from
discovery
from
that
member
by
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
suppose
a
member
of
the
control
group
himself
had
carried
out
the
investigation
and
had
collected
all
the
statements
from
the
witnesses,
surely
you
could
get
them
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
instead
he
tells
the
lawyer
to
gather
them,
and
the
lawyer
gathers
them
and
then
gives
them
to
the
control
group
member.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
corporation
has
a
general
counsel
and
he's
just
simply
authorized
to
settle
or
litigate
all
personal
injury
actions
against
the
corporation,
and
he
does
the
investigations
and
does
the
settling,
and
he
just
sends
something
to
the
treasurer
when
he
settles
one.
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
corporation
has
no...
there
is
no
privilege
in
that
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
although
he
is
the
sole
person
who
is
authorized,
who
has
been
authorized
to
make
these
settlements
and
decide
them
on
the
part
of
the
corporation,
he
would
not
be
a
control
group
person
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
and
you
wouldn't
recognize
that
he's
communicating
with
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'll
just
say,
in
that
circumstance
there
just
isn't
any
attorney-client
privilege?
