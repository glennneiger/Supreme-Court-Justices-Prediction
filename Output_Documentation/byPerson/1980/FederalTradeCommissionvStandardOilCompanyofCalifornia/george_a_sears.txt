mr.
george
a.
sears
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
george
a.
sears
--i'd
be
glad
to
do
that,
your
honor.
the
cases
present
entirely
disparate
issues.
the
only
party
to
this
case
is
the
standard
oil
company
of
california.
in
the
indiana
case
seven
of
the
eight
respondents
in
docket
8934
are
the
plaintiffs
in
that
suit.
the
issue
in
the
indiana
case
goes
to
a
denial
of
due
process
to
respondents
because
of
a
denial
of
discovery
in
docket
8934
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
the
orders
of
the
judge
which
prompted
the
indiana
case
were
orders
which
denied
respondents
any
discovery
until
after
complaint
counsel
had
completed
their
discovery
and
had
perhaps
further
defined
the
issues
in
the
case.
the
suit
before
judge
mcnagny
contended
that
such
a
denial
of
discovery
per
se
was
a
denial
of
due
process
in
the
circumstances
of
the
litigation.
judge
mcnagny
agreed
with
that
and
he
voided
it,
the
two
orders
in
question,
of
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
directed
that
the
administrative
law
judge
should
reconsider
discovery
applications
by
the
respondents.
i
think
from
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you'll
understand
that
the
issue
there
is
entirely
disparate
from
the
issue
presented
here
today.
it
was
made
explicitly
clear
in
the
pleadings
in
the
indiana
case
that
no
challenge
was
being
made
to
the
reason
to
believe
of
the
commission
at
the
time
it
issued
the
complaint
in
the
case.
that
was
explicitly
clear
in
that
case.
that
issue,
the
absence
of
reason
to
believe
that
standard
of
california
had
violated
section
5
before
the
complaint
issued
is
the
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case
exclusively.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
allegations
in
standard's
complaint
state
a
claim
for
relief.
there
is
no
evidentiary
record.
the
9th
circuit
held
that
the
allegations
of
standard's
complaint
and
the
reasonable
inferences
therefrom
state
a
claim
for
relief
on
account
of
conduct
of
the
commission
which
is
in
violation
of
constitutional
and
statutory
requirements.
standard's
claim
is
that
the
commission
charged
standard
with
a
federal
offense
without
reason
to
believe
that
standard
had
violated
the
law,
that
is,
without
any
basis
to
relate
conduct
to
standard
in
the
relevant
geographic
area
to
a
violation
of
section
5
of
the
ftc
act.
the
commission's
position
in
the
case
is
that
whether
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
standard
had
violated
section
5
is
not
subject
to
review
in
any
court
at
any
time,
and
that
the
basis
for
its
action,
however
invidious
and
unrelated
to
statutory
requirement,
may
never
be
examined
by
a
court.
that
commission
assertion
of
unreviewable
prerogative
cannot
be
squared
with
due
process
safeguards
or
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
george
a.
sears
i'd
like
to
comment
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
cases
which
i
cite
in
our
brief
show
that
upon
a
proper
showing,
an
examination
may
be
made
into
the
question
of
whether
an
indictment
has
been
handed
down
without
any
evidence,
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence,
to
show
probable
cause
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime.
that
kind
of
an
examination
may
be
made
on
a
proper
showing.
i
am
asserting
the
same
line
of
reasoning
here,
adding
only
this
comment,
that
this
is
a
stronger
case
for
examining
the
basis
for
commission
action.
the
reason
is
that,
conceptually,
the
grand
jury
stands
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
citizen
charged
with
crime.
mr.
george
a.
sears
--may
i
just
finish
my
sentence,
your
honor?
mr.
george
a.
sears
--whereas
in
this
case
obviously
the
commission
itself
is
prosecutor
here
as
well
as
judge
under
the
ftc
act
and
the
commission
acts
directly
upon
the
citizens,
the
person.
that's
why
i'm
suggesting
this
is
a
stronger
reason
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
absence
of
basis
for
commission
action.
now,
sir,
costello.
as
i
have
stated
and
quoted
in
my
brief,
justice
burton's
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
makes
explicit
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
an
examination
into
the
adequacy
or
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
on
the
one
hand
and
the
absence
of
evidence,
a
no-evidence
situation,
no
evidence
to
relate
conduct
of
defendant
to
commission
of
offense,
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
george
a.
sears
again,
sir,
as
the
cases
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
demonstrate,
that
is
done.
mr.
george
a.
sears
i
submit,
sir,
that
costello
from
this
court
supports
that,
that
it
directly
supports
that.
mr.
george
a.
sears
it
may
be,
your
honor,
though
i
couldn't
testify
to
that.
i'm
not
familiar
standing
here
with
thompson
v.
louisville,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
sears
in
that
case,
your
honor,
it
supports
this
case,
because
my
contention
here
is
that
the
commission
issued
the
complaint
in
docket
8934,
having
before
it
no
evidence
which
could
support
any
inference--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--because,
again,
of
reasons
which
i
have
laid
out
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
that
the
commission
felt
intense
pressure
in
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
that
time.
mr.
george
a.
sears
well,
your
honor--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--let
me
put
it
a
little
differently,
if
i
might.
let
me
suggest
that
what
the
commission
more
likely
thought
to
itself
if,
here
we've
had
a
winter
of
people
shivering
in
their
homes
with
fuel
oil
shortages,
and
we've
had
a
spring
when
people
are
cursing
in
lines
in
gas
stations
and
we
think
that
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
jump
on
the
bandwagon,
to
get
out
front,
and
let
people
know
that
we
are
trying
to
do
something
to
confront
a
situation
of
obvious
public
concern.
mr.
george
a.
sears
no,
i
don't
say
that
either,
sir.
again,
as
i've
laid
out
in
my
complaint
in
the
case,
i
think
that
senator
jackson's
actions
were
highly
significant.
they
brought
to
bear
in
a
specific
time
period
a
focus
of
pressure
on
the
commission
which
led
it
to
act
and
which,
i
suggest,
led
it
to
act
rashly
and
unlawfully,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
here.
mr.
george
a.
sears
well,
let
me...
let
me
talk
around
the
corners
of
that
a
little
bit.
i
am
not
here
to
charge
commissioners
with
bad
faith,
with...
for
example,
responding
to
your
honor's
suggestion
that
they
somehow
acted
fraudulently
in
the
circumstances,
knowing
that
they
had
no
basis
on
which
to
act.
i'm
not
here
suggesting
or
arguing
that.
i
don't
need
to
do
that,
that's
not
the
drive
of
the
case.
the
drive
of
the
case
is
that,
in
fact,
the
commissioners
had
no
basis
on
which
to
relate
conduct
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
california
in
the
relevant
geographic
area
of
the
east
and
gulf
coast
states
of
the
united
states,
to
a
violation
of
section
5
of
the
ftc
act.
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
george
a.
sears
let
me
state
it
in
my
view,
sir,
what
it
is
that
the
commission
should
do.
the
commission
should
with
draw
the
complaint,
for
the
law
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
point.
the
statute
is
explicit
that
a
complaint
may
be
issued
by
the
commissioner
only
upon
the
basis
of
a
reason
to
believe
determination
that
the
respondent
has
violated
section
5.
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
they
must
withdraw
the
complaint.
mr.
george
a.
sears
they
must,
for
the
reason
i've
already
stated,
an
explicit
legal
requirement,
they
must
withdraw
the
present
complaint.
now,
what,
sir,
the
commission
might
elect
to
do
in
that
circumstance
is
obviously
something
i
would
not
predict.
one
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances,
one
of
the
very
important
considerations
that
exists
here,
is
that
this
case,
if
it
were
to
proceed
on
this
unlawfully
issued
complaint,
would
conduct
an
examination
into
a
period
of
time
prior
to
july,
1973,
when
the
complaint
issued.
that's
the
period
on
which
it
must
make
a
determination
of
liabilities,
as
your
honor
well
knows.
as
your
honor
equally
well
knows,
the
petroleum
world
today
is
an
entirely
new
world
from
what
it
was
prior
to
july
1973.
we
have
a
department
of
energy,
20,000
employees
plus;
we
have
pervasive
regulation
of
the
industry;
the
entire
international
and
national
oil
world
is
a
new
world.
in
that
circumstance,
sir,
i
don't
know
what
the
commission
might
choose
to
do.
it
is
not
going
to
lose
anything
which
it
has
done
to
date,
however.
let
me
make
that
very
clear
to
your
honor.
all
the
commission
has
done
to
date
in
this
case
is
to
secure
production
of
massive
volumes
of
documents
from
the
eight
respondents.
those
documents
are
not
going
to
disappear
if
the
complaint
were
properly
to
be
withdrawn.
they
would
remain
available
to
the
commission,
to
be
applied
in
what
would
then
be
a
proper
investigation
of
what
the
world
of
today
is
like.
if
they
chose
after
that
examination
to
reissue
a
complaint
on
a
proper
basis,
they
then
could
do
that.
sir?
mr.
george
a.
sears
or...
and
as
well;
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
a.
sears
i
have
not
made
myself
fully
clear,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
sears
well,
i
am
saying
to
you,
sir,
that
the
commission,
the
commission
may
or
may
not
today
have
reason
to
believe
that
standard
of
california
has
violated
the
law.
it
may
assert
that,
but
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honor
that
you
are
assuming
something
that
very
plainly
is
not
in
evidence.
mr.
george
a.
sears
there
is
a
presumption
of
regularity,
which
is,
as
your
honor
knows,
a
rebuttable
presumption,
and
the
point
of
this
complaint
is
that
standard
of
california
has
shown
a
proper
basis
for
a
judicial
inquiry
into
whether
the
commission,
when
it
issued
the
complaint,
did
have
any
basis
for
a
reason
to
believe
determination.
that's
exactly
the--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--the
complaint
includes
as
all
commission
complaints
include,
a
recital,
a
formal
recital
at
the
outset,
that
there
has
been
a
finding
of
reason
to
believe,
and
that
the
action
is
in
the
public
interest.
the
contention
here,
sir,
again
is
that
there
has
been
a
basis
shown,
a
prima
facie
basis
for
a
judicial
inquiry
shown
in
the
allegations
of
standard's
complaint,
indicating
that
in
this
extraordinary
instance...
and
to
repeat,
there
were
extraordinary
circumstances
that
preceded
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
of
july,
1973.
in
this
instance
those
are
truly
bare
recitals.
there
is
not
a
fact
behind
them
which
would
serve
to
relate
the
conduct
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
california
in
the
relevant
area
on
the
one
hand,
to
a
violation
of
section
5
on
the
other.
mr.
george
a.
sears
that's
an
interesting
question,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
answer
is,
yes,
i
would
still
be
here.
mr.
george
a.
sears
i'll
tell
you
why
i
hesitated:
because
it
is
the
existence
of
the
jackson
letter
coupled
with
subsequent
developments
of
public
record
that
provided
very
apparent
reason
for
inquiry
into
what
if
anything
it
was
the
commission
had
done.
mr.
george
a.
sears
there
may
be
an
inquiry
into
motive
of
an
agency
in
appropriate
cases,
sir.
there
may
be.
i
think
i
need
not
go
that
far
in
this
case.
the
core
of
this
case
goes
to
the
absence
of
any
basis
for
commission
action.
that's
what
this
case
goes...
as
your
honor
very
well
knows,
federal
judges
make
determinations
of
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
committed
a
crime,
every
day
of
their
lives.
and
they
make
those
determinations
without
any
suggestion
from
a
prosecutor
that
that
kind
of
an
evaluation
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
basis
for
probable
cause,
either
invades
the
prosecutor's
mental
processes,
or
incurs
the
proper
exercise
of
his
prosecutorial
discretion.
as
i
say,
your
honor
well
knows
that
isn't
the
case.
probable
cause
reviews
are
made
every
day.
mr.
george
a.
sears
no,
i
would
think
that
would
clearly
not
vitiate
that
conviction.
mr.
george
a.
sears
no,
that
would
not
vitiate
that
conviction.
mr.
george
a.
sears
well,
that
is
why
i
was
responding
the
way
i
was.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
here
in
this
case
is
entirely
different
than
the
one
you
posed.
it's
simply
a
different
issue.
mr.
george
a.
sears
your
honor,
one
of
the
great
things
about
the
united
states
is
that
the
courts
are
open
to
litigants.
there
may
be
other
claims
of
this
kind
advanced,
but
i
am
not
aware,
to
take
a
federal
example,
that
there
has
been
any
abuse
of
the
provisions
of
rule
12
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
which
permit
an
examination
into
absence
of
probable
cause
to
support
either
information
or
indictment.
i'm
not
aware
that
there
has
been
any
abuse
of
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
permits
an
immediate
inquiry
into
whether
there
was
any
support
for
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
i'm
not
aware
that
that
exists,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
two
more
factors
that
apply
here.
what
has
been
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
and
i
think
what
was
approved
by
this
court
in
dunlop
v.
bachowski
is
a
very
narrow
scope
of
review.
it
is
a
most
stringent
standard
which
we
must
meet
in
this
case,
or
which
other
prospective
litigants
must
make
in
some
other
case.
i
think
that
the
threat
of
some
kind
of
massive
infusion
of
cases
into
this
judicial
system
is
simply
not
true
in
fact.
mr.
george
a.
sears
the
federal
trade
commission
act
permits
complaints
to
issue
on
the
vote
of
three
commissioners.
and
assuming
for
a
moment,
sir,
and
i
think
this
is
the
direction
of
your
question,
that
the
three
commissioners
had
factual
foundation
for
their
determination
of
reason
to
believe.
let
me
assume
that
with
you.
then
i
think
we
have
a
situation
which
is
quite
close
to
the
boise-cascade
case
which
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
this
morning.
i
am
answering
your
question
by
saying
that
then,
in
that
case,
i
think
the
complaint
issuance
would
be
proper.
you
had
three
proper
votes
for
the
issuance
of
a
complaint.
and
again,
that
was
true
in
boise-cascade.
mr.
george
a.
sears
that's
precisely
my
analogy...
the
different...
the
concerns--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--yes.
the
court
of
appeals
held--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--well,
let
me
address
that.
i
thought
that
perhaps--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--let
me
state
what
my
understanding
of
the
narrow
scope
of
review
directed
by
the
9th
circuit
is.
mr.
george
a.
sears
we
have
to
go
to
the
court's
language,
of
course.
mr.
george
a.
sears
the
court
said
this
in
its
opinion:
"a
restriction
on
the
ftc's
discretion
is
embodied
in
the
very
terms
of
15
u.s.c.
45(b).
"
"the
ftc
must
first
in
fact
make
a
reason
to
believe
determination
that
the
law
has
been
violated.
"
"see
hunt
foods
and
industries,
286
f.
2d
803,
806.
"
at
that
page
the
relevant
sentence
from
the
hunt
foods
case,
also
a
9th
circuit
decision,
says,
"the
commission
cannot
have
reason
to
believe
unless
it
is
in
possession
of
facts
warranting
such
a
belief.
"
now,
coming
back
to
where
we
started
on
this,
your
honor,
yes,
i
am
saying
that
the
reason
to
believe
review,
that
very
narrow
review,
open
to
the
district
court,
is
comparable
to
the
very
narrow
review
permitted
to
a
district
judge
of
whether
there
is
probable
cause.
mr.
george
a.
sears
i
think
not,
your
honor,
for
the
reason--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--if
i
may,
sir,
i
know
no
way--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--the
answer
to
your
question,
sir,
is,
yes,
i
would
be
entitled
to
proceed
to
explore,
as
the
9th
circuit
said,
as
you
interpret
the
opinion,
whether
a
determination
of
reason
to
believe
was
made
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
george
a.
sears
that's
correct,
your
honor;
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
a.
sears
not
whether
it
was
correct
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
and
again,
the
9th
circuit
made
this
explicit
in
its
opinion.
and
that's...
the
9th
circuit
said
that
the
district
court,
on
review,
may
not
substitute
its
view
of
what
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
5
for
that
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
it
said
that,
and
that's
why
i'm
saying
there
is
such
a
very
narrow
scope
of
review
that
is
directed
by
the
9th
circuit.
it
is
the
kind
of
very
narrow
review
that
was
directed
by
this
court
in
dunlop
v.
bachowski.
mr.
george
a.
sears
that's
what
the
court
said;
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
a.
sears
that
happens
to
be
what
it
held;
right.
mr.
george
a.
sears
i
am,
sir,
and
again--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--i
don't
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
am
not
seeking
relief,
i
am
not
seeking
relief
in
docket
8934,
your
honor.
i
have
filed
an
independent
suit
in
united
states
district
court,
which
is
my
proper
remedy.
mr.
george
a.
sears
oh,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
with
great
deference,
your
honor.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
have
read
to
you--
mr.
george
a.
sears
--i
have
read
to
you
the
precise
sentences
from
the
9th
circuit,
which
to
my
mind
indicate
the
definition
of
a
very
narrow
scope
of
review
directed
by
the
court.
i'm
going
to
have
to
stand
on
that
statement
and
not
repeat
myself.
mr.
george
a.
sears
the
nature
of
standard's
claim
points
the
way
to
the
necessary
relief
in
district
court
and
dissolves
arguments
about
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
and
finality
of
administrative...
agency
action.
standard
brought
its
suit
in
district
court
because
it
has
no
other
remedy
for
the
commission
wrongdoing
in
question.
it
is
essential
in
this
connection
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
commission
has
a
prosecutorial
function
as
well
as
an
adjudicative
role.
the
adjudicative
proceedings
in
docket
8934
are
directed
to
commission
allegations
against
respondents,
not
to
determination
of
wrongful
conduct
by
the
commission
itself.
there
will
be
no
record
in
docket
8934
of
the
conduct
of
the
commission
in
issue
for
any
ultimate
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
upon
a
cease
and
desist
order
against
the
respondents.
the
unlawful
commission
conduct
here
in
issue
is
not
a
procedural
ruling
or
other
action
by
the
commission
in
its
adjudicative
role
in
the
course
of
docket
8934.
it
is
unlawful
conduct
by
the
commission
in
its
prosecutorial
function,
antecedent
to
commencement
of
docket
8934.
there's
a
crucial
distinction.
now,
standard
accordingly
has
no
administrative
remedy
to
exhaust,
nor
any
judicial
remedy
in
a
court
of
appeals.
there
is
no
question
about
the
finality
of
the
commission's
denial
of
standard's
right
to
due
process
in
regard
to
the
charges
the
commission
issued
against
standard.
standard's
suit
in
district
court
is
the
only
remedy
it
has,
it
is
the
remedy
that
the
law
provides
for
the
commission's
unconstitutional
and
unlawful
conduct
here
in
issue.
thank
you,
your
honor.
