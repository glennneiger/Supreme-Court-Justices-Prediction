justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
in
an
administrative
proceeding
such
as
this,
does
the
main
information-seeking
process
occur
in
the
pleading
stage
or
in
the
discovery
stage?
that
is,
could
the
commission
simply
issue
a
complaint
in
the
language
of
the
statute
and
serve
it
on
the
respondent
and
the
respondent
simply
file
a
general
denial
and
then
go
to
discovery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
one
go
further
than
that
in
the
court
system
and
say
that
if
a
prosecutor
initiates
a
prosecution
a
defendant
can't
come
in
and
have
it
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
the
prosecutor
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
evidence
would
prove
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
it
really
require
any
probing
at
all
if
five
commissioners
all
signed
a
piece
of
paper
and
verified
it
saying,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
unfair
practices
took
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sears,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
costello
case
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
suggest
then
that
in
a
federal
court
a
defendant
could
come
in
and
move
to
dismiss
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
the
government
simply
had
no
evidence
to
prove
its
case?
justice
rehnquist
are
there
any
cases
from
this
court
support
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
don't
we
have
to
say
that
every
time
a
respondent
is
made
a
party
by
the
federal
trade
commission
that
party
has
a
right
to
go
into
federal
district
court
before
there's
been
any
trial
before
the
administrative
law
judge
and
say,
the
agency
doesn't
have
any
facts
to
back
up
its
allegations?
