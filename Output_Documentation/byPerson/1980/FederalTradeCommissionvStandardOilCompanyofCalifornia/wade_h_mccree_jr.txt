mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
trade
commission
act
of
1914
provides
in
part
that
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
or
affecting
commerce
are
declared
unlawful.
and
it
further
provides
that
whenever
the
commission
shall
have
reason
to
believe
that
any
corporation
is
using
any
unfair
method
of
competition
and
if
it
shall
appear
to
the
commission
that
a
proceeding
in
respect
thereof
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
public,
it
shall
issue
and
serve
on
the
respondent
a
complaint,
which
requires
an
answer,
administer
the
proceedings
to
establish
the
proof
of
the
allegations
set
out
therein,
and
then
the
issuance,
in
case
the
allegations
are
established,
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
which,
unless
overturned
by
a
court
on
review
or
unless
the
period
for
review,
which
is
60
days,
has
expired,
then
becomes
enforceable.
this
case
presents
important
questions
of
administrative
law
and
it
requires
the
court
to
answer
a
question
that
might
be
stated
as
follows:
this
case
requires
the
court
to
decide
whether
during
the
pendency
of
an
administrative
proceeding
a
district
court
that
concededly
cannot
review
the
sufficiency
of
what
is
alleged
in
the
agency
complaint
to
constitute
its
reason
to
believe
that
certain
firms
have
violated
the
law,
can
nevertheless
determine
whether
the
agency
in
fact
made
the
reason
to
believe
determination
that
caused
it
to
file
the
complaint.
the
case
arises
out
of
the
following
factual
situation.
the
federal
trade
commission
in
1971
authorized
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
the
structure
of
the
petroleum
industry
caused
it,
or
contributed
to
its
engaging
in
unfair
trade
practices.
the
investigation
was
concerned
with
competition,
principally
at
the
refining
end
of
the
petroleum
industry,
and
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
crude
oil
or
importation
end
of
it.
the
method
in
which
the
staff
conducted
the
investigation
consisted
essentially
of
seeking
information
from
independent
operators
and
not
directly
from
the
principal
vertically
integrated
corporations
by
calling
in
their
officers
or
by
subpoenaing
their
records.
it
also
consisted
of
seeking
information
from
several
governmental
agencies
that
had
the
responsibility
of
collecting
data
about
the
petroleum
industry.
this
began
in
1971.
in
1973
when
the
nation
first
experienced
an
acute
fuel
shortage,
senator
henry
jackson
sent
a
letter
to
the
federal
trade
commission
chairman
requesting
that
within
30
days
the
commission
write
a
report
on
the
relationship
between
the
structure
of
the
petroleum
industry
and
the
shortage
of
petroleum
products
that
was
afflicting
the
country.
that
was
may,
1973.
on
july
6,
1973,
the
federal
trade
commission
submitted
to
senator
jackson
a
commission
report
entitled,
"preliminary
federal
trade
commission
staff
report
on
its
investigation
of
the
petroleum
industry.
"
and
it
indicated
that
this
report
had
not
yet
been
evaluated
by
the
commission,
nor
did
the
findings
and
conclusions
necessarily
reflect
those
of
the
commission.
it
also
asked
that
the
report
not
be
given
undue
publicity
because
it
might
jeopardize
subsequent
prosecution.
on
july
13,
seven
days
later,
senator
jackson
released
the
preliminary
report
for
publication
as
a
committee
report.
on
july
18,
then,
the
commission,
having
on
the
previous
july
17
issued
a
report
stating
that
it
intended
to
file
a
complaint,
caused
its
complaint
to
be
filed
naming
the
eight
petroleum
companies
that
were
respondents
before
the
commission
and
are
respondents
here,
charging
that
they
were
violating
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
that
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
that
fact
existed,
and
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
proceed
to
a
hearing
on
the
allegations
that
the
complaint
set
forth,
describing
the
acts
and
practices
claimed
to
be
in
violation
of
the
act.
standard
oil
of
california,
one
of
the
eight
named
petroleum
companies,
moved
the
commission
to
dismiss
its
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
the
commission
did
not
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
respondent
had
violated
the
law
at
the
time
it
issued
the
complaint,
and
that
the
proceeding
was
not
in
the
public
interest.
the
commission
denied
these
motions
by
order
of
february
12,
1974.
respondent
then
sought
reconsideration
of
this
order
and
on
june
4,
1974,
the
commission
denied
the
motion
for
rehearing
and
reiterated
its
previous
determination
that
the
adequacy
of
the
commission's
"reason
to
believe"
that
a
violation
of
the
law
had
occurred,
and
its
belief
that
a
proceeding
would
be
in
the
public
interest,
was
not
litigable.
the
commission
staff
then
proceeded
with
discovery
to
prepare
to
prove
the
allegations
set
forth
in
the
administrative
complaint
and
standard
oil
of
california
and
the
other
seven
respondent
petroleum
companies
vigorously
resisted
its
efforts
for
discovery.
eleven
months
later,
on
may
1,
1975,
standard
oil
of
california
filed
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
for
declaratory
relief,
contending
that
the
federal
trade
commission
did
not
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
violation
of
law
had
occurred
at
the
time
it
filed
its
complaint.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
proceeding
in
indiana,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
a
similar
proceeding
brought
by
standard
oil
of
indiana,
another
one
of
the
eight
respondents,
also
asserting
that
the
commission
did
not
have
reason
to
believe
that
section
5
of
the
act
had
been
violated
at
the
time
it
filed
its
petition,
its
administrative
complaint.
that
matter
was
decided
as
far
as
its
result
is
concerned
favorably
to
the
commission,
because
the
district
court,
although
looking
into
the
matter,
concluded
that
the
commission
had
reason
to
believe
and
therefore
the
commission
was
successful
at
the
district
court
level.
an
appeal
was
noticed
in
that
and
dismissed,
i
believe,
but
there
is
no
court
of
appeals
decision
pending
with
reference
to
that,
and
as
far
as
i
am
aware
that
matter
rests.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i
think
it
has
no
precedential
value
for
this
purpose,
it
just
shows
that
another
district
court
thought
that
it
could
at
that
stage
of
the
administrative
proceeding
look
into
the
adequacy
of
the
reason
to
believe
standard,
or
look
into
whether
the
commission
did
in
fact
make
the
reason
to
believe
determination.
but
it's
not
a
precedent
for
us
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
more
recently,
in
a
case
called
boise-cascade,
that
was
decided
last
may,
the...
i
believe...
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
delaware
decided
that
a
district
court
could
not
look
into
the
sufficiency
of
a
reason
to
believe
determination.
and
if
the
indiana
case
is
a
precedent
against
the
commission,
certainly
the
boise-cascade
case
is
a
precedent
for
the
commission.
but
we
think
that
neither
is
even
instructive
to
this
court,
except
for
the
favorable
language
that
we
find
in
the
boise-cascade
case,
which
effectively
follows
the
language
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
matter
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
where
standard
oil
of
california
filed
the
complaint
to
which
i
just
made
reference.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
it
is
the
only
one
before
us
in
this
case;
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
not.
i
think
the
commission
must
have
reason
to
believe.
i
don't
think
it
could
do
it
capriciously,
and
if
the
justice's
inquiry
looks
to
that
point,
i
would
say,
it
cannot
do
it
capriciously.
it
must
have
reason
to
believe,
but
it's
our
contention
that
what
constitutes
reason
to
believe
as
the
argument
will
develop
is
a
matter
that
is
not
reviewable
by
the
court,
that
if
it's
agency
action
it
is
action
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
agency
and
therefore
is
not
reviewable.
we
would
liken
it
to
prosecutorial
discretion
to
initiate
a
prosecution.
responsibly,
a
prosecutor
would
not
initiate
a
prosecution
unless
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
some
basis
for
it.
but
we
submit
that
ordinarily
a
court
will
not
inquire
into
the
reason
why
a
prosecutor
decided
to
initiate
a
fraud
proceeding.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
right.
he
cannot
do
that.
we
quite
agree.
and
we
contend
that
he
cannot
do
it
here
either.
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
upon
entertaining
this
complaint
that
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
other
relief
proceeded
essentially
to
determine,
first,
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
reason
to
believe,
the
sufficiency
of
the
facts
that
gave
the
commission
reason
to
believe
as
it
recited
was
committed
to
agency
discretion
and
was
not
reviewable
for
the
district
court.
and
neither
side
disagrees
with
that
determination.
he
then
dismissed
the
action
brought
before
him.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
for
the
9th
circuit,
two
members
of
a
three-judge
panel
agreed
first
with
the
determination
of
the
district
court,
agreeing
that
the...
well,
i'm
ahead
of
myself.
i'll
take
it
step
by
step
if
i
may.
first,
it
determined
that
it
was
agency
action
to
file
the
complaint,
which
is
something
with
which
we
disagree
and
i'll
talk
about
it
in
a
few
moments.
second,
it
determined
that
whether
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
the
act
had
been
violated
was
agency
action
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
agency,
and
therefore
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
could
not
be
reviewed
by
the
court.
however...
and
we
think
it's
a
little
extraordinary...
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
decide
that
judicial
review
is
available
with
respect
to
whether
the
commission
did
in
fact
make
a
reason
to
believe
determination,
and
that
there
was
law
to
apply,
as
this
court
used
this
phrase,
in
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park
v.
volpe,
and
it
vacated
the
judgment
of
dismissal
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
district
judge
with
instructions
to
find
out,
did
the
commission
in
fact
make
a
reason
to
believe
determination,
which
determination
is
unreviewable,
as
it
decided.
that's
the
status
in
which
this
matter
confronts
the
court
this
morning.
one
judge
dissented
on
the
ground
that
the
commission's
action
initiating
the
administrative
proceeding
is
in
essence
an
exercise
of
prosecutorial
discretion
and
as
such
is
exempted
from
judicial
review.
he
also
said
that
to
permit
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
determination
was
in
fact
made
would
require
an
impermissible
probing
into
the
mental
processes
of
the
commission
and
that
it
was
something
in
which
the
court
should
not
engage.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
we
contend
that
that's
really
what
we
have
here.
this
complaint
is
regular
on
its
face.
the
complaint
purports
to
be
issued
pursuant
to
the
authorization
of
the
commission,
the
complaint
recites
that
a
reason
to
believe
determination
was
made,
the
complaint
is
attested
to
by
the
secretary
of
the
commission
and
is
in
every
respect
in
proper
form.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals
did
what
we
regard
as
an
extraordinary
thing
and
suggests
that
the
complaint
that
was
filed
before
the
district
court
is
sufficient
to
raise
that
question.
and
i
think
it's
very
much
like
questioning
an
indictment
handed
down
by
a
grand
jury.
it's
in
proper
form,
it's
signed
by
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
recites
that
a
majority
of
the
grand
jurors
agree
to
the
allegations
set
forth
in
the
indictment,
and
then
the
defendant
is
permitted,
before
any
proof
is
introduced,
to
say,
i
don't
think
they
really
agreed
to
that.
and
the
court
would
investigate
to
see
whether
or
not
that
happened.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
perhaps
in
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
but
when
the
indictment
is
fair
on
its
face,
there's
no
suggestion
that
it's
a
forgery,
there's
no
suggestion
that
it
was
altered,
it
just
relates
to
the
mental
processes
of
the
grand
juror,
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
what
respondent,
standard
oil
of
california,
asserts,
essentially,
is
that
the
decision
to
file
the
administrative
complaint
was
motivated
politically
because
of
the
intervention
of
senator
jackson
who
made
this
inquiry.
and
that
is
really
the
essence
of
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
it
certainly
would
be
a
waste
of
judicial
time
and
a
waste
of
administrative
time
to
do
that,
because
they
could
do
exactly
what
you
suggest.
they
could
dismiss
it
and
have
a
resolution.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it's
certainly
passing
strange
that
the
commission
would
keep
it
alive
under
all
those
circumstances
if
it
had
not
at
least
ratified
its
act
of
filing
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
commission
had
any
doubt
about
it,
and
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
decision
to
file
the
complaint
should
be
insulated
from
judicial
review,
because
if
the
commission
recognized
that
it
made
a
mistake,
we
would
expect
it
to
behave
responsibly
and
to
strike
its
complaint.
the
fact
that
it
proceeds
with
it...
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
proceeded
here
through
some
very
arduous
and
not
too
productive
discovery.
i'm
advised
that
there
have
been
almost
400
proceedings
relating
to
the
commission's
effort
to
get
discovery
in
this
matter,
and
that
there
have
been
14
or
15
lawsuits
filed,
matters
of
various
sorts,
to
quash
subpoenas,
the
matter
to
which
the
chief
justice
referred
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana,
and
this
matter,
and
others.
while
the
commission
tried
to
establish
something,
that
curiously
enough
someone
said,
they
didn't
really
intend
to
file.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
arguendo,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can
make
that
concession,
and
i
think
this
happens
sometimes
in
the
criminal
area
where
a
prosecution
takes
place
because
the
public
is
insistent
upon
the
solving
of
some
crime
that
vexes
it,
and
sometimes
perhaps
in
those
instances
a
grand
jury
may
return
an
indictment
with
unseemly
haste.
the
question,
of
course,
becomes
whether
they
actually
did
it,
and
the
proof
of
the
sufficiency
of
it
comes
in
its
capacity
to
sustain
it
later
on.
and
if
the
commission
in
this
case
cannot
sustain
these
allegations,
of
course
there
will
be
no
cease
and
desist
order,
which
is
the
sanction
that
the
commission
would
impose
if
its
staff
in
presenting
evidence
could
establish
these
facts.
and
that's
a
higher
standard
than
reason
to
believe,
which
is
a
very
vague
standard.
also,
i
would
like
to
comment
too,
further
stimulated
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
political
inquiry
doesn't
of
itself
vitiate
the
proceeding
or
suggest
that
there's
not
reason
to
believe.
the
congress
has
responsibility
for
the
same
matters
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has,
to
see
that
there
are
not
anticompetitive
activities
in
the
petroleum
market.
and
for
it
to
make
an
inquiry
of
an
agency
that
was
created
with
the
primary
function
to
oversee
these
matters
seems
to
me
the
most
responsible
kind
of
legislative
action
that
could
take
place.
and
nowhere
does
standard
oil
of
california
assert
that
senator
jackson
required
them
to
file
an
action,
or
even
suggested
that
they
file
an
action.
his
was
an
inquiry
about
their
investigation,
which
commenced
in
1971
and
it
proceeded
for
17
months
before
the
fuel
crisis
stimulated
him
in
his
capacity
as
chairman
of
the
permanent
investigations
subcommittee
of
the
senate,
to
make
this
inquiry.
our
argument,
essentially,
is
as
follows.
first,
we
suggest
that
the
issuance
of
an
administrative
complaint
is
not
agency
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
think
it
is.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
your
question
probably
results
from
the
fact
that
we
did
not
use
that
very
language
when
we
filed
our
petition,
but
we
did
use
this
language,
that
the
matter
is
not
final
agency
action.
now,
if
it's
to
be
final
agency
action,
it
has
to
be
agency
action
in
the
first
place,
and
so
the
first--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--it
is
ultimately,
except
it
can't...
if
it's
not
agency
action
at
all,
it
can't
be
final
agency
action,
and
we
suggest
that--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
would
prefer
to
win
on
the
argument
i've
made
up
to
now.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion
and
that
it
is
not
reviewable.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
should
decide
this
is
agency
action
and
wishes
to
agree
with
our
contention
that
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion,
we'd
be
very
pleased
to
win
on
that
basis.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i'm
pleased
to
have
the
court
make
that
inquiry
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
on
proper
analysis
it
isn't
agency
action,
because
the
administrative
procedures
act
defines
agency
action
as
a
number
of
things,
none
of
which
remotely
resembles
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
entirely
correct.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
i
have
about
five
minutes
remaining.
with
the
permission
of
the
court
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
court's
permission,
we
will
rest
our
argument
on
our
brief.
