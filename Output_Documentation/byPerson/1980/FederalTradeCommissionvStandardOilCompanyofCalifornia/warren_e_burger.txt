chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
federal
trade
commission
v.
standard
oil
company
of
california.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
at
some
point
to
mention
the
proceeding
in
indiana?
at
your
own
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say
is
the
impact
of
that
holding
on
this
case,
if
any?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
there
be
a
preliminary
proceeding
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
whether
a
grand
jury
had
ever
indeed
handed
down,
or
whether,
on
the
contrary,
a
fraud
was
being
perpetrated
on
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you,
mr.
solicitor
general,
concede
arguendo...
and
assume,
arguendo...
that
the
commission
may
have
acted
with
unseemly
haste
in
responding
to
the
congressional
inquiry
and
yet
take
the
position
that
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
central
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
we
need
to
deal
with
that
at
all,
or
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
isn't
subject
to
judicial
review,
then
no
matter
how
we
describe
it
it
isn't
final
agency
action.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
there
are
only
three
minutes
remaining,
counsel,
before
lunch.
i
think
we'll
not
ask
you
to
divide
your
argument,
so
we'll
resume
at
this
point,
mr.
sears,
at
1
o'clock.

[recess.]
mr.
sears,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
comment
on
the
possible
implications
of
the
indiana
holding
where
we
have
the
same
parties?
there's
certainly
an
interconnection
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
would
necessarily
reject
any
analogy
between
the
indictments
by
a
grand
jury
and
the
action
and
the
action
taken
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
concede
that
it's
regular
on
its
face?
the
complaint
is
regular
on
its
face?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
record
were
opened
and
we
knew
or
it
was
stipulated
that
three
commissioners
thought
there
was
reason
to
believe,
and
two
thought
there
was
not
reason
to
believe.
what
would
that
do?
what
impact
would
that
have?
it
would
show
among
other
things
that
the
matter
was
contested,
and
therefore
perhaps
more
closely
examined,
at
least
under
some
theories,
than
a
unanimous
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
