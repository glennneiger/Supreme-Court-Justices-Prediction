justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
the
federal
trade
commission
against
standard
oil
of
california,
the
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
an
administrative
law
question
of
some
importance.
in
1973,
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
a
complaint
against
eight
oil
companies
including
the
respondent,
the
standard
oil
of
california,
charging
violations
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
respondent
is
sued
in
the
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
commission
had
issued
its
complaint
without
having
reason
to
believe
that
violations
had
occurred.
the
season
to
believe
a
statutory
term
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
commission's
authority
to
issue
complaints.
the
district
court
dismissed
respondent's
complaint
but
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
it
held
that
the
district
court
should
have
inquired
whether
in
fact
a
sufficient
investigation
had
been
made.
in
our
view,
the
commission's
issuance
of
its
complaint
is
not
final
agency
action
under
section
10
(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
mere
issuance
is
not
a
definitive
ruling
and
it
had
no
legal
or
practical
effect
on
respondent
other
than
the
expense
and
disruption
that
attends
any
major
litigation
in
the
absence
of
final
agency
action,
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
is
not
judicially
reviewable
before
administrative
adjudication
is
concluded.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens,
while
concurring
into
judgment
has
filed
a
separate
opinion.
in
the
second
of
these
cases
--
oh,
i
should
have
announced
that
mr.
justice
stewart
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case
that
i
have
just
announced.
