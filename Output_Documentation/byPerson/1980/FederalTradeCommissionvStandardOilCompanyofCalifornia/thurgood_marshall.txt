mr.
sears,
let
me
try
it
another
way.
if
the
letter
from
senator
jackson
was
not
here,
would
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
would
you
be
alleging
or
indicating
or
urging?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
the
right
to
inquire
into
the
motive
of
a
government
agency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
sears,
if
you
go
to
prosecutorial
discretion,
then
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble.
suppose
you
show
in
a
case
that
a
man
convicted
of
eight
crimes,
the
conviction
was
set
up
by
a
man
that
wrote
a
letter
and
said,
i
think
this
man
committed
some
crimes.
would
that
vitiate
that
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
a
senator
had
written
a
letter,
would
it
vitiate
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
where
do
you
get
your
prosecutorial
discretion
in
this
case?
it's
not
here.
it's
not
the
same
thing,
is
it?
i
thought
you
said
that
in
the
beginning,
that
it
was
not
the
same
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
