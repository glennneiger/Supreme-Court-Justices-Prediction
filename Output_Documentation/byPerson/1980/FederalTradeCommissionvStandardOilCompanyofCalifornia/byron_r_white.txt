justice
white
that
really
is
directed
at
a
different
point,
isn't
it,
not
final
agency
action?
justice
white
well,
would
you
be
as
satisfied
with
winning
on
the
argument
you've
made
up
to
now
as
you
would
on
this
one?
justice
white
namely,
that
it's
committed
to
agency
discretion?
justice
white
even
though
it's
agency
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
courts
review,
must
review,
or
that
you're
entitled
to
have
the
courts
review
whether
or
not
there
was
actually
probable
cause
to
issue
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
only
thing
that
was
reviewable
was
whether
they
had
purported
to
make
the
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
reject?
what
did
you
claim
that
it
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
had
misunderstood
then,
apparently.
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
whether
or
not
there
was
actually
probable
cause
to
issue
the
complaint,
or
reasonable
cause
to
issue
the
complaint,
it
wasn't
reviewable.
but
whether
or
not
the
commission
had
made
such
a
determination
was
an
open
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
suppose
for
the
moment
that
i
am
correct
in
reading
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
the
way
i
do.
just
suppose
that.
would
you
be
entitled
to
urge
what
you're
now
urging,
as
a
respondent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there...
do
you
suppose
there's
an
answer
to
my
question,
or
do
you
have
an
answer
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
whether
a
determination
had
been
made,
not
whether
it
was
a
correct
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
now
urging
that
it
is
also
open
to
a
court
in
this
case
to
say
whether
the
determination
was
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
what
the
court
of
appeals
said?
"under
this
standard
a
determination
by
the
ftc
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
a
violation
of
law
has
occurred
is
within
the
agency's
discretion
and
not
reviewable
in
the
district
court
under
the
apa.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
it
held.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
suggesting,
however,
that
whether
there
is
reason
to
believe,
is
open
to
review.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
again
suggest
to
you
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
urge
that
as
a
respondent
without
having
cross-petitioner,
because
it
expands
the
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
sustain,
if
we
agreed
with
everything
you've
argued
today,
you
would
get
more
relief
cut
of
this
court
than
the
court
of
appeals
gave
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
blame
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
well,
that's
fair
enough.
