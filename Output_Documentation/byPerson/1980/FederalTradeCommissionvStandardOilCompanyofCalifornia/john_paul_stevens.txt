justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
of
your
interpretation
of
the
9th
circuit
opinion,
assuming
the
following.
assume
that
somehow
or
other
the
facts
came
to
light
and
there
was
in
fact
political
motivation
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
but
by
the
time
the
commission
responded
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
which
i
understand
they
did
some
months
later,
they
had
reviewed
the
matter
and
then
decided
in
an
orderly
way
at
a
meeting
of
the
full
commission
that
there
was
then
reason
to
believe
the
case
should
go
forward.
but
they
didn't
have
the
reason
to
believe
it
at
the
time
they
filed
the
complaint.
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
would
say
should
be
done
about
that?
would
they
make
you
dismiss
the
complaint
and
start
all
over
and
file
a
new
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
may
in
effect
be
contending
that...
this
is
some
years
ago,
but
in
all
these
years
the
commission
still
hasn't
made
its
determination
that
there's
reason
to
believe
there's
a
violation.
they're
still
keeping
the
case
alive.
is
that
what
they
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--doesn't
the
very
fact
you're
here
defending
what
the
commission
did
implicitly
indicate
that
somebody
has
reason
to
believe
the
case
ought
to
go
forward.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sears,
supposing
that
we
affirm
the
9th
circuit?
the
case
is
sent
back
to
district
court
and
the
commissioners
file
an
affidavit
in
that
court
which
says
in
substance,
well,
they're
right,
we
jumped
the
gun,
we
had
suspicion
but
we
didn't
have
any
facts,
but
we've
been
studying
the
matter
during
the
last
couple
of
years
and
we
are
now
satisfied
there
is
reason
to
believe
standard
has
violated
the
law.
what
should
the
district
court
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they
add
to
their
affidavit
that
we
could
remedy
this
situation
either
by
withdrawing
the
complaint
or
by
amending
the
complaint
and
saying
that
as
of
the
present
we
have
reason
to
believe
there
is
a
violation.
we
don't
want
to
lose
the
benefit
of
the
discovery
we've
had,
so
it's
sort
of
a
futile
gesture
to
start
all
over.
are
they
still
required
by
law
to
move
to
withdraw
the
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
do
it
for
the
period
prior
to
1973,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
don't
understand
what
you
accomplish
by
this
lawsuit.
they
are
now
electing
to
go
forward
on
their
existing
complaint,
which
you
strongly
suggest
they
think
they
hope
to
prove
their
allegations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
in
evidence
if
the
commission
resisted
your
motion
to
dismiss
and
they're
still
defending
their
right
to
prosecute
this
action,
and
we
presume
that
public
agencies
are
acting
in
good
faith
for
the
most
part;
they
are
public
officers
and
i
think
there
is
some
presumption
of
validity
to
their
action.
