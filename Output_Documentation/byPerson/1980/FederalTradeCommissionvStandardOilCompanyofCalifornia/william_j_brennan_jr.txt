justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
standard
oil
of
california
is
the
only
one
of
the
eight
respondents
before
us
in
this
case.
justice
jr.
well,
this
is
an
approach
something
like
thompson
v.
louisville,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
that
was
a
case
of
no
relevant
evidence
whatsoever.
justice
jr.
and
why
do
you
say
it
issued
the
complaint,
mr.
sears?
justice
jr.
you
mean,
they
got
together
and
said,
we
can't
resist
this
pressure
of
senator
jackson
and
let's
just
go
ahead
and
do
it
even
though
we
have
no
evidence
whatever?
justice
jr.
would
they
go
that
far?
justice
jr.
so
that
senator
jackson's
interest
was
no
part
of
this?
justice
jr.
i
gather
your
argument
does...
but
your
argument
does
suggest
that
they
knew
that
they
had
absolutely
no
evidence
to
support
the
issuance
of
the
complaint,
no
reason
to
believe.
