mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
on
this
appeal
is
whether
or
not
a
state
statute
which
purports
to
make
all
interest
earned
on
certain
court
registry
monies,
public
monies
in
an
ultimate
sense,
violates
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
article
iv,
section
4,
thereof.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
this
is
a
basic
property
question
which
could
be
boiled
down
in
a
very
few
words,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
a
question
as
follows:
is
interest
earned
on
monies
held
by
a
court
property
in
a
constitutionally
protected
sense
within
the
parameters
of
the
federal
constitution?
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
has
so
held
for
a
long
time.
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
will
either
rise
or
fall
on
that
particular
question,
but
insofar
as
article
iv,
section
4
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
receding
from
its
position
that
the
article
iv,
section
4
provision
is
political
and
give
it
some
judicial
life
in
situations
where
it
may
be
merited.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
we
believe
it
was
and
we
believe
that
the
record
will
so
reflect.
there
were
due
process
and
equal
protection
arguments
made.
there
was
a
claim
that
this
statute
created
a
taking
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
indeed
it
was.
the
facts
of
the
case,
if
i
may
deal
with
them
for
a
moment,
are
these.
approximately
four
years
ago
a
pharmaceutical
firm
in
seminole
county,
florida,
which
is
just
north
of
orlando,
found
itself
in
grave
financial
difficulties.
that
firm
was
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies.
webb's
attempted
to
find
a
way
out
other
than
bankruptcy
and
towards
such
end
it
entered
into
an
agreement
with
eckerd's
of
college
park,
a
larger,
hopefully
more
solvent
firm,
for
the
purchase
of
the
assets
of
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies
by
eckerd's.
that
step,
that
sale,
was
to
be
effective
pursuant
to
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
in
particular
chapter
676.6106,
the
bulk
sales
provision
of
the
uniform
commercial
code.
the
bulk
sales
provision
as
adopted
in
florida
contains
certain
optional
language,
and
that
optional
language
as
adopted
in
florida
provides
that
in
the
event
of
a
bulk
sale,
if
the
claims
of
creditors
appear
to
exceed
the
purchase
price...
which
was
in
fact
the
case
here...
the
purchaser
may
interplead,
pay
into
court
the
purchase
price,
and
in
so
doing,
if
an
interpleader
action
is
taken
and
if
interpleader
is
permitted,
the
statute
provides
the
bulk
sales
statute.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
think
not,
but
as
to
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
makes
the
appellant's
case
stronger,
because
the
uniform
commercial
code,
mr.
chief
justice,
provides
that
if
an
interpleader
is
taken,
the
money
"shall
be
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court."
on
court
order.
chapter
28,
and
in
particular
the
statute
which
we
seek
here
to
have
held
unconstitutional,
florida
statute
28.33,
directs
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
may
hold
the
money
at
interest.
but
interestingly
enough
in
the
case
before
the
court
today,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
money
was
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
as
is
clearly
revealed
in
the
appendix,
the
trial
court
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
clerk
was
asserting
a
claim
to
the
interest
which
would
be
earned,
sizeable
in
light
of
the
principal
sum
being
$1.8
million,
and
consequently
the
trial
judge
specifically
directed
before
the
money
was
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
that
he
was
reserving
ruling
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
clerk
would
be
entitled
to
this
interest.
we
add,
additionally,
that
in
florida,
pursuant
to
another
statute,
28.24,
the
clerk
received
a
fee
of
over
$9,200
for
holding
this
money.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
we're
not
complaining
about
that,
but
we
believe
that
that
leads
to
an
incongruous
result
which
is
that
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
provides
in
its
substance
that
it
exists
for
the
protection
of
trade,
and
the
bulk
sales
act,
which
provides
that
it
exists
for
the
protection
of
creditors,
creates
a
situation
here
where,
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
florida
statute
28.33,
the
creditors
are
actually
receiving
less
back
from
the
court
than
was
paid
in,
despite
the
fact
that
in
the
year's
time
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
held
this
money
prior
to
my
appointment
as
receiver,
there
was
approximately
$93,000
of
interest
earned
on
this
money.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
that
raises
an
extremely
interesting
question
to
which
i
don't
know
the
answer.
certainly
if
what
had
been
paid
into
court
were
something
other
than
cash,
it
would
seem
that
logic
and
good
sense
would
dictate
that
the
accretions
would
follow
the
principal.
in
other
words,
if
for
some
reason
the
court
were
holding
breeding
livestock,
if
the
court
were
holding
coupon
bonds,
something
of
that
nature,
it
would
seem
inequitable
for
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
clip
the
bonds
and
go
and
collect
the
interest
and
keep
them
for
the
account
of
the
court.
we
also
believe
that,
even
more
egregious,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
ultimately
this
money
is
returned
to
the
general
fund
of
the
county.
that
isn't
the
matter
in
dispute.
that
was
conceded
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
but,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
florida
has
considered
that
matter
in
three
cases,
fitz
v.
watson,
mordt
v.
robinson,
and
another
which
escapes
me
at
this
moment.
and
in
those
three
cases
the
court
ruled,
where
in
fact
money
had
been
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
and
where
in
fact
the
banks
failed,
that
the
loss
of
the
principal
as
well
as
the
interest
lay
on
the
shoulders
of
those
persons
ultimately
found
entitled
to
the
principal
sum.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--or
the
party
paying
the
money
in.
it's
a
law
of
florida
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
general
rule,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
when
money
is
paid
into
court
as
a
matter
of
equity
title
passes
at
the
time
of
payment
from
the
party
paying
money
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
if
he
asserts
no
claim
thereto,
automatically
to
the
person
ultimately
entitled
to
that
fund
even
if
that
person
cannot
at
the
time
of
payment
be
ascertained
with
certainty.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
citation
from
florida
jurisprudence,
but
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
three
florida
supreme
court
decisions.
they
are,
masser
v.
london
operating
company,
mordt
v.
robinson,
and
fitz
v.
watson.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
suppose,
mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct.
but
i
am
thinking
that
in
a
sense
while
the
money
reposes
in
the
court
it
is
constructively
in
the
hands
of
the
clerk.
he
is
the
one
who
is
responsible
for
those
funds.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
think
that
in
that
situation
there
would
be
no
claim
to
interest
because
none
would
have
been
created.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
believe
that
the
argument
could
be
made,
mr.
justice,
that
if
the
investment
were
made
in
the
discretion
of
the
clerk
pursuant
to
a
statute
which
provided
that
the
money
be
invested,
there
might
be
a
slightly
different
way
of
looking
at
the
problem
than
we
have
here,
where
the
clerk
was
acting
under
court
order,
and
we're
saying
that
the
court's
order
would
have
to
take
precedence
over
the
statute.
but
more
important
than
that
is
what
we
believe
is
the
ultimate
issue,
which
is
whether
or
not
this
interest
constitutes
property
in
a
federally
protected
sense.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
believe
that
the
rules
governing
any
fiduciary
relationship
would
apply
to
a
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
florida
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
are
rules
in
other
statutes
which
have
not
been
cited
to
the
court
which
govern
the
investment
of
public
money.
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
declared
that
this
was
"public
money".
the
florida
supreme
court
declared,
"there
is
no
unconstitutional
taking
because
interest
earned
on
the
clerk
of
the
court's
registry
account
is
not
private
property."
it
premised
this
on
the
fact,
i
believe,
in
my
reading
of
the
decisions,
that
while
the
money
was
held
by
the
government,
while
it
was
held
by
the
clerk
as
a
representative
of
florida
government,
the
character
of
that
money
changed
from
private
money
to
public
money.
but
it
should
be
urged,
i
believe,
that
the
individual
claimants
to
this
fund
who
at
the
time
numbered
somewhere
between
200
and
300
had
no
way
of
actually
going
down
to
the
courthouse
and
applying
for
their
money
and
getting
it
promptly.
this
was
so
because
the
validity
of
the
claims
was
in
dispute
as
were
the
amounts
of
the
claims.
and
ultimately
there
were
certain
adversary
actions
taken...
this
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
record
and
i'll
limit
myself,
except
to
say
that
it
was
not
possible
for
the
claimants
to
then
go
to
the
courthouse
and
get
that
which
the
stakeholder
had
said
was
theirs.
it
also
appears
from
the
record
that
when
the
stakeholder
paid
the
money
into
court,
eckerd's
of
college
park,
it
paid
the
money
into
court
with
interest,
although
it
was
not
required
so
to
do.
if
i
may
continue
with
my
argument,
this
court
has
long
ago
stated
a
principle
of
basic
equity
law
which
we
believe
is
totally
applicable
here.
it
was
stated
through
mr.
justice
johnson
in
a
case
styled
himely
v.
rose,
where
he
said
that
interest
is
to
principal
as
fruit
is
to
the
tree.
and
insofar
as
the
federal
courts
have
reviewed
this
particular
question,
we
believe
that
the
preponderance
of
authority
is
supportive
of
the
position
taken
by
the
receiver,
and
on
behalf
of
the
creditors
of
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
according
to
my
reading
of
it,
it
does
not
require
it,
but
in
at
least
three
circuits
it
has
been
held
that
it
is
altogether
proper
for
interest
to
be
earned
upon
this
money
and
if
and
when
earned
the
money
should
be
paid
over
to
the
ultimate
recipient
of
the
fund.
and
the
authorities
that
i
would
cite
to
the
court
for
that
are,
in
the
5th
circuit,
which
is
our
circuit
in
florida,
the
case
of
talcott
v.
allahabad
bank,
which
was
a
complex
piece
of
federal
litigation
heard
in
savannah,
georgia,
by
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals.
his
decision,
which
in
part
awarded
interest...
although
that
was
not
the
only
issue...
was
subsequently
appealed
to
the
5th
circuit.
the
5th
circuit
affirmed
saying
that
the
award
of
interest
was
proper.
in
another
case
styled
murphy
v.
travelers
insurance
company,
the
5th
circuit
applied
the
texas
rule
because
it
was
subject
to
the
laws
of
texas
and
awarded
interest.
those
are
both
cases
from
the
early
1970s.
the
7th
circuit
in
a
case
styled
brooks
v.
woodington
said
that
it
was
proper
to
award
interest.
and
the
8th
circuit
did
so
in
the
case
of
baxter
v.
united
forest
products.
there
are
also
decisions
cited
in
our
briefs
from
many
lower
courts,
one
out
of
the,
i
believe,
the
western
district
of
missouri,
where
the
award
of
interest
has
been
upheld.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--and,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
where
he
has
done
so
because
as
in
our
case
the
court
ordered
that
the
money
be
held
at
interest.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
don't
think
you'd
have
a
claim
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
interest
would
have
been
created.
i'm
not
arguing
here
today
that
the
rules
applicable
to
interpleader,
the
common
law
equity
rules
and
the
rules
governing
the
registry
of
the
courts
require
that
money
be
invested
at
interest,
but
rather
that
when
interest
is
earned,
that
interest
becomes
the
property
of
the
ultimate
owner
of
the
principal,
it
being
a
rule
of
equity
and
i
believe
a
rule
followed
by
both
the
federal
courts
and
the
majority
of
state
courts
that
the
interest
follows
the
principal
as
a
matter
of
natural
right
as
well
as
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
don't
believe
i
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
there
is
no
contrary
case
law
that
i
can
find
in
the
state
of
florida.
i
believe
that
in
effect
this
was
a
case
of
first
impression
insofar
as
it
related
to
interest
on
private
monies
held
in
the
court
registry.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
the
case
was
initiated
by
the
purchaser
of
the
assets
of
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies,
eckerd's
of
college
park,
which
was
a
stakeholder.
they
paid
the
purchase
price
into
the
registry
of
the
court
and
then--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--because
the
uniform
commercial
code
at
676.6106
provides
for
that
procedure
with
specificity.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
this
is
one
way
that
a
purchaser
of
business
assets,
where
the
business,
in
effect,
owes
more
than
it's
receiving
for
its
assets,
one
way
where
the
purchaser
can
obtain
clear
title.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
the
purpose
of
the
bulk
sales
act
is
to
see
the
creditors
get
notice.
a
further
purpose
of--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--i
would
argue,
mr.
justice,
that
it
is
a
taking
of
property,
to
take
interest,
and
if
interest--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--this
statute
was
adopted
in
florida
approximately
in
1972
or
'73.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
mr.
justice.
one
of
the
things
that
this
statute
says
is
that
the
clerk
"may"
deposit
money
in
interest-bearing
accounts.
the
court
has
said--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--that's
correct.
but
it
says
earlier
on,
"monies
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court
shall
be
deposited
in
interest-bearing
certificates
at
the
discretion
of
the
clerk."
in
this
case
we
believe--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--that's
correct.
in
this
case
the
court
acted
even
before
the
clerk
had
an
opportunity,
telling
the
clerk
in
advance
of
receiving
the
first
dollar,
as
the
appendix
will
reveal,
a
day
before,
that
this
money
was
going
to
be
held
at
interest
and
the
court
would
determine
later
on
whether
or
not
this
interest
would
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
clerk
or
to
the
benefit
of
the
court,
and--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--mr.
justice
white,
the
county
will
be
arguing,
i'm
sure,
in
just
a
few
moments
that
the
other
device
is
me.
i
was
appointed
as
receiver
to
hold
this
money
for
the
court
and
to
obtain
interest
for
the
court
as
well
as
to
make
distribution
to
the
creditors.
however,
we
think
that
that
is
a
little...
it
strains
reason,
that
the
court
can--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--i
believe
that
the
state
commits
a
constitutional
violation,
and
we
are
arguing
in
this
case
that
the
state
commits
a
constitutional
violation
where
in
the
event
there
is
a
crucial--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--in
that
situation
we
say
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
justice
white,
the
uniform
commercial
code
says,
"the
court
shall
require
the
consideration
to
be
deposited
into
the
registry
of
the
court."
and
that's
at
676.
106,
subsection
4.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
that
is
an
option
with
the
interpleader
who
is
seeking
to
be
discharged
from
the
proceedings,
a
person,
the
stakeholder,
who
has
no
further
claim.
but
at
this
point
the
identity
of
the
claimants
to
the
fund
may
or
may
not
be
ascertained
with
certainty.
they
certainly
are
not
in
the
position
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
that's
correct.
the
state
courts,
which
have
considered
this
problem,
have
for
the
most
part,
we
believe,
found
a
constitutional
problem
to
exist,
a
due
process
problem,
a
problem
of
taking
without
compensation,
a
taxation
on
the
courts.
the
texas
case
of
sellers
v.
harris
county
involved
$1
million
being
interpleaded
into
the
local
court
in
texas.
there
was
a
statute
similar
to
the
statute
in
florida.
the
texas
court
said
that
the
taking
of
interest
was
unconscionable,
that
the
county
would
profit
enormously
and
unfairly
if
the
litigation
lasted
for
more
than
a
short
period
of
time...
half
as
much
money
being
involved
in
texas
as
was
involved
in
the
case
here...
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
citing
myles
salt,
found
there
to
be
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
in
a
similar
case,
mcmillan
v.
robeson
county,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said
that
there
were
constitutional
problems,
due
process
problems,
where
interest
earned
on
registry
monies
became
property
of
the
state
without
an
effort
to
give
notice
to
the
ultimate
owners
of
those
funds
that
the
money
was
there
so
that
they
could
come
into
court
and
"fortify
themselves"
with
constitutional
safeguards.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
don't
personally
see
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
may
be
great
wisdom
to
what
you're
saying.
it
reminds
me,
though,
of
a
case
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
malin
v.
lamoure
county,
where
the
probate
fees
in
north
dakota
were
set
to
depend
on
how
much
money
was
involved
in
the
estate.
and
a
constitutional
argument
was
made
that
since
the
fees
charged
became
very,
very
large
as
the
size
of
an
estate
went
up,
that
this
was
a
tax
upon
access
to
the
courts
rather
than
a
fee.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
if
you
have
a
million
dollars
at
registry
earning
10
percent,
the
tax
could
be
$100,000
a
year;
$2
million,
it
could
be
$200,000
a
year
without
any
regard
to
the
benefit
which
the
fund
had
received.
and
this
is
on
top
of
the
fact
that
the
clerk
has
already
received
a
fee
under
28.24
for
his
services.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
would
still
make
the
same
argument.
if
that
fee
were
not
in
the
statute,
we
would
have
a
case
essentially
on
all
fours
with
the
sellers
case
in
texas.
in
sellers
there
was
no
fee,
and
the
appellate
court,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
determined
that
the
proper
fashion
in
which
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue,
avoid
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
still
treat
the
clerk
fairly,
was
merely
to
award
the
clerk
a
fair
sum
of
money
in
consideration
of
his
efforts.
we
would
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
purposes
of
rebuttal,
if
we
may.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
this
seller
did
go
into
involuntary
bankruptcy
and
through
an
arrangement
with
the
bankruptcy
court
which
i
don't
entirely
understand,
there
were
essentially
two
proceedings,
one
in
the
state
court,
one
in
the
federal
court.
we
distributed
the
assets--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--i
did
too,
but
there
was
an
election
made
in
this
case
prior
to
my
appointment
to
permit
the
state
court
proceedings
to
continue
to
their
conclusion.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
would
agree
with
you
but
that
did
not,
in
fact,
happen.
there
was
a
bankruptcy
proceeding--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--the
creditors
were
the
ones
who
originally
raised
this
issue.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
no.
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
i
believe,
was
precipitated
for
different
reasons
with
which
i
am
not
familiar.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
blackmun,
to
respond
to
that
for
a
moment,
looking
at
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
"it
is
the
statute
itself
which
gives
the
authority
to
the
clerk
and
outlines
the
method
of
disposition."
so
i
believe,
insofar
as
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
requirement
or
an
option
to
investment,
that
helps.
i
believe
that
the
statute
by
plain
reading
indicates
that
the
clerk
may
invest
at
interest
but
is
not
so
required.
as
far
as
the
characterization--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--to
our
knowledge,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
correct.
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
special
consideration
given
to
this
statement
by
the
florida
supreme
court:
"these
funds
are
considered
"public
money"
from
the
time
they
are
deposited
in
the
general
registry
of
the
court
to
the
time
they
leave
the
account."
i
would
point
out
as
well,
that
in
condemnation
cases
in
florida,
florida
follows
the
rule
set
out
in
the
case
of
sarasota
v.
burch,
that
interest
on
condemnation
monies
follows
the
principal.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
know,
and
i
have
never
been
asked
that
question
before.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
in
closing
that
the
situation
here
is
analogous
to
love
and
marriage.
you
can't
have
one
without
the
other.
you
can't
have
principal
without
interest,
you
can't
have
love
without
marriage.
it's
true
that
you
can
have
physical
love
without
the
benefit
of
marriage
and
that
you
could
have
principal
without
benefit
of
interest,
but
if
there's
going
to
be
a
marriage
one
has
to
have
love
to
sustain
it,
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
interest
one
must
own
the
principal
to
receive
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
already
distributed
to
the
creditors
the
bulk
of
the
estate.
my
fee
was
a
small
portion
of
the
amount
of
interest
which
was
earned
on
it
during
the
time
that
i
held
it,
so
that
the
creditors
benefited
from
the
money
being
held
outside
the
court
in
that
they
received
a
portion
of
interest.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
possible.
i
don't
know
that
it
is
applicable
to
this
particular
case,
but
it
is
indeed
possible.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
on
this
appeal
is
whether
or
not
a
state
statute
which
purports
to
make
all
interest
earned
on
certain
court
registry
monies,
public
monies
in
an
ultimate
sense,
violates
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
article
iv,
section
4,
thereof.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
this
is
a
basic
property
question
which
could
be
boiled
down
in
a
very
few
words,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
a
question
as
follows:
is
interest
earned
on
monies
held
by
a
court
property
in
a
constitutionally
protected
sense
within
the
parameters
of
the
federal
constitution?
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
has
so
held
for
a
long
time.
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
will
either
rise
or
fall
on
that
particular
question,
but
insofar
as
article
iv,
section
4
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
receding
from
its
position
that
the
article
iv,
section
4
provision
is
political
and
give
it
some
judicial
life
in
situations
where
it
may
be
merited.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
we
believe
it
was
and
we
believe
that
the
record
will
so
reflect.
there
were
due
process
and
equal
protection
arguments
made.
there
was
a
claim
that
this
statute
created
a
taking
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
indeed
it
was.
the
facts
of
the
case,
if
i
may
deal
with
them
for
a
moment,
are
these.
approximately
four
years
ago
a
pharmaceutical
firm
in
seminole
county,
florida,
which
is
just
north
of
orlando,
found
itself
in
grave
financial
difficulties.
that
firm
was
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies.
webb's
attempted
to
find
a
way
out
other
than
bankruptcy
and
towards
such
end
it
entered
into
an
agreement
with
eckerd's
of
college
park,
a
larger,
hopefully
more
solvent
firm,
for
the
purchase
of
the
assets
of
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies
by
eckerd's.
that
step,
that
sale,
was
to
be
effective
pursuant
to
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
in
particular
chapter
676.6106,
the
bulk
sales
provision
of
the
uniform
commercial
code.
the
bulk
sales
provision
as
adopted
in
florida
contains
certain
optional
language,
and
that
optional
language
as
adopted
in
florida
provides
that
in
the
event
of
a
bulk
sale,
if
the
claims
of
creditors
appear
to
exceed
the
purchase
price...
which
was
in
fact
the
case
here...
the
purchaser
may
interplead,
pay
into
court
the
purchase
price,
and
in
so
doing,
if
an
interpleader
action
is
taken
and
if
interpleader
is
permitted,
the
statute
provides
the
bulk
sales
statute.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
think
not,
but
as
to
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
makes
the
appellant's
case
stronger,
because
the
uniform
commercial
code,
mr.
chief
justice,
provides
that
if
an
interpleader
is
taken,
the
money
"shall
be
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court."
on
court
order.
chapter
28,
and
in
particular
the
statute
which
we
seek
here
to
have
held
unconstitutional,
florida
statute
28.33,
directs
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
may
hold
the
money
at
interest.
but
interestingly
enough
in
the
case
before
the
court
today,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
money
was
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
as
is
clearly
revealed
in
the
appendix,
the
trial
court
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
clerk
was
asserting
a
claim
to
the
interest
which
would
be
earned,
sizeable
in
light
of
the
principal
sum
being
$1.8
million,
and
consequently
the
trial
judge
specifically
directed
before
the
money
was
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
that
he
was
reserving
ruling
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
clerk
would
be
entitled
to
this
interest.
we
add,
additionally,
that
in
florida,
pursuant
to
another
statute,
28.24,
the
clerk
received
a
fee
of
over
$9,200
for
holding
this
money.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
we're
not
complaining
about
that,
but
we
believe
that
that
leads
to
an
incongruous
result
which
is
that
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
provides
in
its
substance
that
it
exists
for
the
protection
of
trade,
and
the
bulk
sales
act,
which
provides
that
it
exists
for
the
protection
of
creditors,
creates
a
situation
here
where,
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
florida
statute
28.33,
the
creditors
are
actually
receiving
less
back
from
the
court
than
was
paid
in,
despite
the
fact
that
in
the
year's
time
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
held
this
money
prior
to
my
appointment
as
receiver,
there
was
approximately
$93,000
of
interest
earned
on
this
money.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
that
raises
an
extremely
interesting
question
to
which
i
don't
know
the
answer.
certainly
if
what
had
been
paid
into
court
were
something
other
than
cash,
it
would
seem
that
logic
and
good
sense
would
dictate
that
the
accretions
would
follow
the
principal.
in
other
words,
if
for
some
reason
the
court
were
holding
breeding
livestock,
if
the
court
were
holding
coupon
bonds,
something
of
that
nature,
it
would
seem
inequitable
for
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
clip
the
bonds
and
go
and
collect
the
interest
and
keep
them
for
the
account
of
the
court.
we
also
believe
that,
even
more
egregious,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
ultimately
this
money
is
returned
to
the
general
fund
of
the
county.
that
isn't
the
matter
in
dispute.
that
was
conceded
in
the
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
but,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
florida
has
considered
that
matter
in
three
cases,
fitz
v.
watson,
mordt
v.
robinson,
and
another
which
escapes
me
at
this
moment.
and
in
those
three
cases
the
court
ruled,
where
in
fact
money
had
been
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
and
where
in
fact
the
banks
failed,
that
the
loss
of
the
principal
as
well
as
the
interest
lay
on
the
shoulders
of
those
persons
ultimately
found
entitled
to
the
principal
sum.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--or
the
party
paying
the
money
in.
it's
a
law
of
florida
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
the
general
rule,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
when
money
is
paid
into
court
as
a
matter
of
equity
title
passes
at
the
time
of
payment
from
the
party
paying
money
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
if
he
asserts
no
claim
thereto,
automatically
to
the
person
ultimately
entitled
to
that
fund
even
if
that
person
cannot
at
the
time
of
payment
be
ascertained
with
certainty.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
citation
from
florida
jurisprudence,
but
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
three
florida
supreme
court
decisions.
they
are,
masser
v.
london
operating
company,
mordt
v.
robinson,
and
fitz
v.
watson.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
suppose,
mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct.
but
i
am
thinking
that
in
a
sense
while
the
money
reposes
in
the
court
it
is
constructively
in
the
hands
of
the
clerk.
he
is
the
one
who
is
responsible
for
those
funds.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
think
that
in
that
situation
there
would
be
no
claim
to
interest
because
none
would
have
been
created.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
believe
that
the
argument
could
be
made,
mr.
justice,
that
if
the
investment
were
made
in
the
discretion
of
the
clerk
pursuant
to
a
statute
which
provided
that
the
money
be
invested,
there
might
be
a
slightly
different
way
of
looking
at
the
problem
than
we
have
here,
where
the
clerk
was
acting
under
court
order,
and
we're
saying
that
the
court's
order
would
have
to
take
precedence
over
the
statute.
but
more
important
than
that
is
what
we
believe
is
the
ultimate
issue,
which
is
whether
or
not
this
interest
constitutes
property
in
a
federally
protected
sense.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
believe
that
the
rules
governing
any
fiduciary
relationship
would
apply
to
a
clerk
of
the
court.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
florida
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
are
rules
in
other
statutes
which
have
not
been
cited
to
the
court
which
govern
the
investment
of
public
money.
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case,
because
the
florida
supreme
court
declared
that
this
was
"public
money".
the
florida
supreme
court
declared,
"there
is
no
unconstitutional
taking
because
interest
earned
on
the
clerk
of
the
court's
registry
account
is
not
private
property."
it
premised
this
on
the
fact,
i
believe,
in
my
reading
of
the
decisions,
that
while
the
money
was
held
by
the
government,
while
it
was
held
by
the
clerk
as
a
representative
of
florida
government,
the
character
of
that
money
changed
from
private
money
to
public
money.
but
it
should
be
urged,
i
believe,
that
the
individual
claimants
to
this
fund
who
at
the
time
numbered
somewhere
between
200
and
300
had
no
way
of
actually
going
down
to
the
courthouse
and
applying
for
their
money
and
getting
it
promptly.
this
was
so
because
the
validity
of
the
claims
was
in
dispute
as
were
the
amounts
of
the
claims.
and
ultimately
there
were
certain
adversary
actions
taken...
this
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
record
and
i'll
limit
myself,
except
to
say
that
it
was
not
possible
for
the
claimants
to
then
go
to
the
courthouse
and
get
that
which
the
stakeholder
had
said
was
theirs.
it
also
appears
from
the
record
that
when
the
stakeholder
paid
the
money
into
court,
eckerd's
of
college
park,
it
paid
the
money
into
court
with
interest,
although
it
was
not
required
so
to
do.
if
i
may
continue
with
my
argument,
this
court
has
long
ago
stated
a
principle
of
basic
equity
law
which
we
believe
is
totally
applicable
here.
it
was
stated
through
mr.
justice
johnson
in
a
case
styled
himely
v.
rose,
where
he
said
that
interest
is
to
principal
as
fruit
is
to
the
tree.
and
insofar
as
the
federal
courts
have
reviewed
this
particular
question,
we
believe
that
the
preponderance
of
authority
is
supportive
of
the
position
taken
by
the
receiver,
and
on
behalf
of
the
creditors
of
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
according
to
my
reading
of
it,
it
does
not
require
it,
but
in
at
least
three
circuits
it
has
been
held
that
it
is
altogether
proper
for
interest
to
be
earned
upon
this
money
and
if
and
when
earned
the
money
should
be
paid
over
to
the
ultimate
recipient
of
the
fund.
and
the
authorities
that
i
would
cite
to
the
court
for
that
are,
in
the
5th
circuit,
which
is
our
circuit
in
florida,
the
case
of
talcott
v.
allahabad
bank,
which
was
a
complex
piece
of
federal
litigation
heard
in
savannah,
georgia,
by
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals.
his
decision,
which
in
part
awarded
interest...
although
that
was
not
the
only
issue...
was
subsequently
appealed
to
the
5th
circuit.
the
5th
circuit
affirmed
saying
that
the
award
of
interest
was
proper.
in
another
case
styled
murphy
v.
travelers
insurance
company,
the
5th
circuit
applied
the
texas
rule
because
it
was
subject
to
the
laws
of
texas
and
awarded
interest.
those
are
both
cases
from
the
early
1970s.
the
7th
circuit
in
a
case
styled
brooks
v.
woodington
said
that
it
was
proper
to
award
interest.
and
the
8th
circuit
did
so
in
the
case
of
baxter
v.
united
forest
products.
there
are
also
decisions
cited
in
our
briefs
from
many
lower
courts,
one
out
of
the,
i
believe,
the
western
district
of
missouri,
where
the
award
of
interest
has
been
upheld.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--and,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
where
he
has
done
so
because
as
in
our
case
the
court
ordered
that
the
money
be
held
at
interest.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
don't
think
you'd
have
a
claim
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
interest
would
have
been
created.
i'm
not
arguing
here
today
that
the
rules
applicable
to
interpleader,
the
common
law
equity
rules
and
the
rules
governing
the
registry
of
the
courts
require
that
money
be
invested
at
interest,
but
rather
that
when
interest
is
earned,
that
interest
becomes
the
property
of
the
ultimate
owner
of
the
principal,
it
being
a
rule
of
equity
and
i
believe
a
rule
followed
by
both
the
federal
courts
and
the
majority
of
state
courts
that
the
interest
follows
the
principal
as
a
matter
of
natural
right
as
well
as
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
don't
believe
i
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
there
is
no
contrary
case
law
that
i
can
find
in
the
state
of
florida.
i
believe
that
in
effect
this
was
a
case
of
first
impression
insofar
as
it
related
to
interest
on
private
monies
held
in
the
court
registry.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
the
case
was
initiated
by
the
purchaser
of
the
assets
of
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies,
eckerd's
of
college
park,
which
was
a
stakeholder.
they
paid
the
purchase
price
into
the
registry
of
the
court
and
then--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--because
the
uniform
commercial
code
at
676.6106
provides
for
that
procedure
with
specificity.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
this
is
one
way
that
a
purchaser
of
business
assets,
where
the
business,
in
effect,
owes
more
than
it's
receiving
for
its
assets,
one
way
where
the
purchaser
can
obtain
clear
title.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
the
purpose
of
the
bulk
sales
act
is
to
see
the
creditors
get
notice.
a
further
purpose
of--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--i
would
argue,
mr.
justice,
that
it
is
a
taking
of
property,
to
take
interest,
and
if
interest--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--this
statute
was
adopted
in
florida
approximately
in
1972
or
'73.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
yes,
mr.
justice.
one
of
the
things
that
this
statute
says
is
that
the
clerk
"may"
deposit
money
in
interest-bearing
accounts.
the
court
has
said--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--that's
correct.
but
it
says
earlier
on,
"monies
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court
shall
be
deposited
in
interest-bearing
certificates
at
the
discretion
of
the
clerk."
in
this
case
we
believe--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--that's
correct.
in
this
case
the
court
acted
even
before
the
clerk
had
an
opportunity,
telling
the
clerk
in
advance
of
receiving
the
first
dollar,
as
the
appendix
will
reveal,
a
day
before,
that
this
money
was
going
to
be
held
at
interest
and
the
court
would
determine
later
on
whether
or
not
this
interest
would
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
clerk
or
to
the
benefit
of
the
court,
and--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--mr.
justice
white,
the
county
will
be
arguing,
i'm
sure,
in
just
a
few
moments
that
the
other
device
is
me.
i
was
appointed
as
receiver
to
hold
this
money
for
the
court
and
to
obtain
interest
for
the
court
as
well
as
to
make
distribution
to
the
creditors.
however,
we
think
that
that
is
a
little...
it
strains
reason,
that
the
court
can--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--i
believe
that
the
state
commits
a
constitutional
violation,
and
we
are
arguing
in
this
case
that
the
state
commits
a
constitutional
violation
where
in
the
event
there
is
a
crucial--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--in
that
situation
we
say
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
justice
white,
the
uniform
commercial
code
says,
"the
court
shall
require
the
consideration
to
be
deposited
into
the
registry
of
the
court."
and
that's
at
676.
106,
subsection
4.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
that
is
an
option
with
the
interpleader
who
is
seeking
to
be
discharged
from
the
proceedings,
a
person,
the
stakeholder,
who
has
no
further
claim.
but
at
this
point
the
identity
of
the
claimants
to
the
fund
may
or
may
not
be
ascertained
with
certainty.
they
certainly
are
not
in
the
position
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
that's
correct.
the
state
courts,
which
have
considered
this
problem,
have
for
the
most
part,
we
believe,
found
a
constitutional
problem
to
exist,
a
due
process
problem,
a
problem
of
taking
without
compensation,
a
taxation
on
the
courts.
the
texas
case
of
sellers
v.
harris
county
involved
$1
million
being
interpleaded
into
the
local
court
in
texas.
there
was
a
statute
similar
to
the
statute
in
florida.
the
texas
court
said
that
the
taking
of
interest
was
unconscionable,
that
the
county
would
profit
enormously
and
unfairly
if
the
litigation
lasted
for
more
than
a
short
period
of
time...
half
as
much
money
being
involved
in
texas
as
was
involved
in
the
case
here...
and
as
a
consequence
of
that,
citing
myles
salt,
found
there
to
be
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
in
a
similar
case,
mcmillan
v.
robeson
county,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said
that
there
were
constitutional
problems,
due
process
problems,
where
interest
earned
on
registry
monies
became
property
of
the
state
without
an
effort
to
give
notice
to
the
ultimate
owners
of
those
funds
that
the
money
was
there
so
that
they
could
come
into
court
and
"fortify
themselves"
with
constitutional
safeguards.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
don't
personally
see
it
that
way,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
may
be
great
wisdom
to
what
you're
saying.
it
reminds
me,
though,
of
a
case
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
malin
v.
lamoure
county,
where
the
probate
fees
in
north
dakota
were
set
to
depend
on
how
much
money
was
involved
in
the
estate.
and
a
constitutional
argument
was
made
that
since
the
fees
charged
became
very,
very
large
as
the
size
of
an
estate
went
up,
that
this
was
a
tax
upon
access
to
the
courts
rather
than
a
fee.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
if
you
have
a
million
dollars
at
registry
earning
10
percent,
the
tax
could
be
$100,000
a
year;
$2
million,
it
could
be
$200,000
a
year
without
any
regard
to
the
benefit
which
the
fund
had
received.
and
this
is
on
top
of
the
fact
that
the
clerk
has
already
received
a
fee
under
28.24
for
his
services.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
would
still
make
the
same
argument.
if
that
fee
were
not
in
the
statute,
we
would
have
a
case
essentially
on
all
fours
with
the
sellers
case
in
texas.
in
sellers
there
was
no
fee,
and
the
appellate
court,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
determined
that
the
proper
fashion
in
which
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue,
avoid
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
still
treat
the
clerk
fairly,
was
merely
to
award
the
clerk
a
fair
sum
of
money
in
consideration
of
his
efforts.
we
would
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
purposes
of
rebuttal,
if
we
may.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
this
seller
did
go
into
involuntary
bankruptcy
and
through
an
arrangement
with
the
bankruptcy
court
which
i
don't
entirely
understand,
there
were
essentially
two
proceedings,
one
in
the
state
court,
one
in
the
federal
court.
we
distributed
the
assets--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--i
did
too,
but
there
was
an
election
made
in
this
case
prior
to
my
appointment
to
permit
the
state
court
proceedings
to
continue
to
their
conclusion.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
i
would
agree
with
you
but
that
did
not,
in
fact,
happen.
there
was
a
bankruptcy
proceeding--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--the
creditors
were
the
ones
who
originally
raised
this
issue.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
no.
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
i
believe,
was
precipitated
for
different
reasons
with
which
i
am
not
familiar.
thank
you.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
blackmun,
to
respond
to
that
for
a
moment,
looking
at
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
"it
is
the
statute
itself
which
gives
the
authority
to
the
clerk
and
outlines
the
method
of
disposition."
so
i
believe,
insofar
as
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
requirement
or
an
option
to
investment,
that
helps.
i
believe
that
the
statute
by
plain
reading
indicates
that
the
clerk
may
invest
at
interest
but
is
not
so
required.
as
far
as
the
characterization--
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
--to
our
knowledge,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
correct.
i
would
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
special
consideration
given
to
this
statement
by
the
florida
supreme
court:
"these
funds
are
considered
"public
money"
from
the
time
they
are
deposited
in
the
general
registry
of
the
court
to
the
time
they
leave
the
account."
i
would
point
out
as
well,
that
in
condemnation
cases
in
florida,
florida
follows
the
rule
set
out
in
the
case
of
sarasota
v.
burch,
that
interest
on
condemnation
monies
follows
the
principal.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
know,
and
i
have
never
been
asked
that
question
before.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
in
closing
that
the
situation
here
is
analogous
to
love
and
marriage.
you
can't
have
one
without
the
other.
you
can't
have
principal
without
interest,
you
can't
have
love
without
marriage.
it's
true
that
you
can
have
physical
love
without
the
benefit
of
marriage
and
that
you
could
have
principal
without
benefit
of
interest,
but
if
there's
going
to
be
a
marriage
one
has
to
have
love
to
sustain
it,
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
interest
one
must
own
the
principal
to
receive
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
have
already
distributed
to
the
creditors
the
bulk
of
the
estate.
my
fee
was
a
small
portion
of
the
amount
of
interest
which
was
earned
on
it
during
the
time
that
i
held
it,
so
that
the
creditors
benefited
from
the
money
being
held
outside
the
court
in
that
they
received
a
portion
of
interest.
mr.
harvey
m.
alper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
possible.
i
don't
know
that
it
is
applicable
to
this
particular
case,
but
it
is
indeed
possible.
thank
you.
