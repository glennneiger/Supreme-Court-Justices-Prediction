79-1033,
webb's
against
beckwith
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
the
issue
is
whether
it
is
constitutional
for
a
county
to
take
as
its
own
under
the
authority
of
a
state
statute
the
interest
accruing
on
an
interpleader
fund
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
county
court
when
at
the
same
time
a
fee
prescribed
by
another
state
statute
is
also
charged
for
the
clerk's
services
in
receiving
the
fund
into
the
registry.
the
statute
which
is
the
subject
of
the
constitutional
challenge
here
is
section
28.33
of
the
florida
statutes.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
unanimously
hold
that
the
county's
taking
was
violative
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
neither
the
florida
legislature
by
statute
nor
the
florida
courts
by
judicial
decree
may
accomplish
the
result
they
sought
simply
by
recharacterizing
the
principal
of
the
deposited
and
concededly
private
fund
as
public
money
because
it
was
held
temporarily
by
the
court.
and
the
earnings
of
the
fund
are
incidents
of
ownership
of
the
fund
itself
and
are
property
just
as
the
fund
itself
is
property.
and
so
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
reversed.
