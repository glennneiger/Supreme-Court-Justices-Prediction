unknown
speaker
we
have
a
very
narrow
question,
then,
here
today
and,
from
your
point
of
view,
a
very
simple
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
haven't
we
held
for
a
long
time
that
the
republican
form
of
government
version
in
the
constitution
is
a
political
one
and
not
capable
of
judicial
enforcement?
unknown
speaker
was
the
constitutional
issue
raised
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
all
the
court
speaks
of
is
just
plain
constitutionality,
and...
as
i
read
your
appendix
and
jurisdictional
statement.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
a
lawsuit
was
involved
if
there's
a
deposit
in
the
registry
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
complaining
about
that?
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
complied
with
this
statute
by
depositing
in
kind
the
equivalent
amount
in
high
yield
government
bonds?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
getting
something,
though,
for
this
money
that's
being
held,
that
is
being
taken
by
the
clerk.
you're
getting
a
depositary
that
is
probably
absolutely
liable
in
the
event
of
theft
or
negligent
loss.
at
least
i've
looked
at
a
florida
case
that
would
suggest
that.
unknown
speaker
and
not
on
the
county
or
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
won't
burden
you
with
any
case
citations
because
i
don't
claim
to
be
an
authority
on
florida
law,
but
the
paragraph
which
i
have
found
in
florida
jurisprudence,
2d,
says,
"court
clerks
are
generally
required
by
statute
to
account
for
all
money
received
by
them
as
public
officers."
"it
would
appear
therefore
that
such
clerks
are
unconditionally
liable
as
insurers
for
the
loss
of
money
that
comes
into
their
hands
because
the
statutory
duty
to
account
is
an
absolute
one."
"thus,
an
action
may
be
brought
against
a
court
clerk
by
a
county
in
the
event
that
a
clerk
unlawfully
withholds
funds
from
it."
unknown
speaker
are
they
in
your
briefs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
that
you're
so
much
different.
those
cases
deal
with
loss,
not
by
the
clerk
but
by
somebody
else.
the
bank
failed.
he
put
them
in
the
bank,
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
he
himself
lost
it
he
would
still
be
absolutely
liable.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
law
didn't
require
an
investment
of
funds
in
the
court's
hands
and
the
court
didn't
invest?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
law
didn't
require
an
investment
but
the
clerk
did
invest
and
earned
interest?
then
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
claim,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
if
an
order
requires
investment
and
he
does
invest,
that
you
are
not
only
entitled
to
the
interest
but
to
the
best
interest
the
clerk
could
have
gotten?
unknown
speaker
sort
of
a
prudent
man
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
he
went
into
high
yield
governments,
he'd
be
on
pretty
safe--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there
is
a
federal
interpleader
act.
does
that
require
that
the
money
paid
into
court,
that
interest
be
paid
on
it?
unknown
speaker
where
the
clerk
has
in
fact
invested--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
what
if
under
a
particular
statute
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
court
or
clerk
invest
it
and
all
you
got
back
was
the
principal,
would
you
make
your
same
constitutional
arguments?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
a
new
rule
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
well,
had
the
florida
courts
held
to
this
effect
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
initiated
the
case
and
put
the
money
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
how
did
they
know
to
do
that?
had
the
creditors--
unknown
speaker
--but
how,
under
that
section...
is
it
perfectly
clear
to
everybody...
the
law
doesn't
require
anybody
to
go
through
this
procedure,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
one
way
also
where
the
creditors
can
be
protected.
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
case...
suppose
this
decision
had
been
made
by
the
florida
courts
ten
years
ago,
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
what
the
florida
law
was.
receiver's
monies
that
earn
money,
or
that
earn
interest,
the
interest
belongs
to
the
public,
belongs
to
the
court.
suppose
that
had
been
the
question
ruled
before
this
case
was
ever
started?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
does
provide
exactly
what
mr.
justice
white
suggests
in
his
question,
and
how
long
has
the
statute
been
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
so,
for
seven
or
eight
years,
this
has
been
the
law
of
florida,
so
far
as
the
statutory
law
goes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
further
says
that
"all
interest
accruing
from
monies
deposited
shall
be
deemed
income
of
the
office
of
the
clerk."
unknown
speaker
then
it
says,
if
he
does
do
that,
the
income
shall
be
his,
the
court's,
or
the
property
of
the
county.
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
other
device
to
accomplish
this
protection
for
the
purchaser
and
the
protection
of
the
creditors?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
you
have
two
ways
of
doing,
performing,
reaching
some
end,
and
one
of
them
requires
sacrificing
the
interest
and
the
other
one
doesn't,
then
you
choose
the
former.
are
you
going
to
say
that
the
state
is
committing
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
it
says
"will
provide"...
and
will
provide
this
mechanism
to
perform
this
distribution,
but
the
only
thing
is
that
we're
going
to
keep
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
could
have
gone
to
a
title
company
or
a
bank
and
deposited
the
money
with
them?
you
didn't
have
to
deposit
it
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
order
to--
--it
could
even
have
been
in
federal
bankruptcy,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
if
what?
it's
optional,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
they
didn't
make
any
election?
the
claimants
didn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
your
argument
spill
over
very
largely
into
the
probate
field
too,
where
there
are
frequently
funds
temporarily
held
in
the
custody
of
the
court?
wouldn't
it
require
radical
revision
of
some
of
the
probate
procedures
in
the
various
states?
unknown
speaker
now
suppose
that
fee
were
not
on
the
statute,
would
your
case
be
different?
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
think
this...
a
creditor
could
have
put
this
seller
into
involuntary
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
come
the
property
then...
i
thought
that
the
bankruptcy
court
inherited
the
bankrupt's
property.
unknown
speaker
because
if
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
took
over,
then
the
bankruptcy
rules
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
did
any
creditor
try
to
protect
himself
from
this
florida
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
would
think
they
would,
but
they
didn't
attempt
to
avoid
the
application
of
this
texas
provision
by
precipitating
a
bankruptcy
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
have
satisfied
the
statute
if
they
had
deposited
the
equivalent
amount
in
high
yield
government,
united
states
government
bonds?
unknown
speaker
then
what
would
the
clerk
be
doing
to
earn
all
this
interest
for
himself?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
clerk
gets
quite
a
large
fee
under
this
florida
supreme
court
decision,
or
he
gets
a
yield,
a
return
for
holding
this
money.
now,
if
they
had
deposited
that
amount
in
government
bonds,
all
he
would
have
had
to
do
was
put
it
in
a
safe
deposit
box
in
the
best
bank
and
once
in
a
while
go
down
and
cut
coupons.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
to
the
clerk,
but
it
goes
to...
it
doesn't
go
to
the
creditors
or
the
principals
involved
in
the
transaction,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is...
by
giving
it
a
name
the
court
can't
make
it
so,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
statute
said
that
in
a
proceeding
of
this
type
the
money
held
shall
be
deemed
to
be
held
by
the
individual,
shall
be
deemed
to
be
public
money
and
the
interest
shall
be
paid
to
the
county?
would
that
be
your
idea
of
due
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
say
you
are
begging
the
question
in
answering
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
$1.8
million
could
be
considered
property.
don't
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
that
in
a
proceeding
of
this
type
the
holder
of
the
$1.8
million
shall
be
from
this
moment
on
holding
government
money,
public
money,
the
interest
of
which
shall
be
paid
to
the
government.
would
that
be
due
process?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
due
process,
then
you
win.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
interest
become
public
money?
unknown
speaker
oh,
because
florida
law
says
so.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
said
that
the
principal
also
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
florida?
would
that
be
consistent
with
the
takings
clause?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
property.
unknown
speaker
let
me
pursue
that,
then.
if
a
client
deposits
some
money
with
a
lawyer
and
he
puts
it
in
an
account,
a
savings
account,
instead
of
just
a
non-interest
checking
account,
whose
property
is
the
interest
on
that
account?
does
it
belong
to
the
lawyer
or
the
client?
unknown
speaker
if
he
puts
it
in
the
savings
account
as
a
trust
account?
unknown
speaker
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
then...
but
you
don't
apply
that
proposition
of
law
here?
unknown
speaker
did
florida
law
require
that
this
money
be
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
in
order
for
the
sale
which
the
parties
contemplated
to
be
completed?
or
could
they
have
gone
about
it
another
way?
unknown
speaker
but
you
also
want
the
other
fee
too?
unknown
speaker
you
also
want
the
$9,500
fee
too?
$9,200?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
funds
he
handles,
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
other
statutory
fee
also.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
put
a
question
to
either
you
or
your
friend
yesterday.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
that.
suppose
they
had
put,
deposited
physically
high
yield
government
bonds
paying
8,
9,
10
percent
and
there
were
no
services
that
needed
to
be
performed,
no
investment
of
the
property,
just
a
matter
of
keeping
them
in
a
secure
place,
the
florida
statute
would
operate
on
the
coupons
that
were
clipped?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
your
opponent
here
sues
here
on
behalf
of
the
receiver
for
the
creditors,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
he
is
the
receiver.
and
under
florida
law
does
his
fee
for
services
as
receiver
come
off
the
top,
so
to
speak,
regardless
of
whether
the
creditors
are
paid
in
full
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
state
may
simply
define
property
in
any
way
it
wants
to
free
of
any
inhibitions
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
here
there
was
interest,
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
there
was
in
fact
interest
even
though
he...
perhaps
the
clerk
of
the
court
was
not
under
any
duty
to
invest
the
monies
in
a
way
that
would
create
interest,
but
here
he
did.
unknown
speaker
so
we're
really
talking
about
to
whom
does
that
interest
constitutionally
belong,
when
in
fact
there
was
interest.
unknown
speaker
in
state
law,
the
state
legislature
can't
just
by
calling
something
public
money
take
private
property
without
compensation
for
it.
he
couldn't
just
take
somebody's
house
in
florida
and
say,
hereafter
john
jones'
house
will
be
public
property.
he's
just
got
to
pay
john
jones
if
he
wants
to
take
it,
under
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
doesn't
really
answer
the
problem
here
to
say,
well,
this
is
public
property,
does
it?
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
own
money
i
have
a
common
law
right
to
keep
it.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
i
have
a
common
law
right
to
keep
that
money
if
i
get
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
he
didn't
get
the
money.
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
yesterday
that
the
state
can
say
that
that
whole
$1.8
million,
the
state
can
take
that
if
they
want
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
it
was
public
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
he
take
the
interest?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
created
the
interest?
unknown
speaker
and
the
vehicle
was
the
taking
of
the
property,
the
$1.8
million.
unknown
speaker
who
owned
that
$1.8
million
during
the
time?
unknown
speaker
and
when
it
was
put
in
the
registry
of
the
bank,
it
became
state
property.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was,
it
became
state
property?
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
state
property
can
the
state
not
take?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
it's
not
really
the
state's
property
to
do
what
it
wants
with
it,
is
it?
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
can
do
one
thing,
it
can
take
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
state
have
said
that
you
could
do
it?
that
you
could
collect
the
interest
on
that
property
and
keep
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
and
you
paid
$9,000
for
that.
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
and
in
addition
to
that
you...
i
hate
to
use
the
word...
confiscate
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do,
is
"cheat"?
unknown
speaker
well,
"take".
is
"take"
a
good
word?
unknown
speaker
the
interest
wasn't
taken?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
interest
taken?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statutory
requirements?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
statute
in
appendix
b
to
your
opponent's
brief,
investment
accounting
funds...
28.33,
which
provides
that
the
clerk
shall
make
an
estimate
of
his
projected
financial
needs
and
shall
invest
funds
in
designated
depositories.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
funds
described
in
that
statute
include
those
funds
that
a
private
party
deposits
with
the
clerk.
does
it
therefore
mean
that
the
clerk
could
use
those
funds
for
the
general
purposes
of
the
county?
because
they
come
within
the
statutory
description
of
all
funds
subject
to
his
control,
which
are
to
be
invested
in
a
particular
way?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
what's
to
prohibit
that?
unknown
speaker
more
specifically,
could
he
commingle
those
funds
with
county
funds?
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
this
statute
doesn't
require
separate
accounting
for
deposited
funds.
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
more
statutes
that
control
this
case
than
the
one
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
could
the
clerk
make
any
use
of
the
money
that's
deposited
with
him,
other
than
to
earn
interest
by
it,
by
its
deposit?
unknown
speaker
could
he
pledge
it
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
but
he
can
make
one
use
of
the
private
parties'
funds?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
happen
to
know,
because
i
don't
find
in
the
briefs,
the
citation
of
the
florida
statute
that
requires
the
clerk
to
keep
these
funds
separate?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
cited
in
the
briefs
or
the
opinion
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
had
had
a
million
dollars,
in
whatever
of
the
50
states
he
was,
a
state
court
couldn't
conclusively
characterize
it
as
public
money,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
there
comes
a
point
at
which
it
is
property
whether
the
state
court
says
it's
property
or
not.
unknown
speaker
the
one
thing
that's
clear
is
that
it's
not
owned
by
the
clerk
of
the
court,
isn't
it?
that
much
is
clear.
unknown
speaker
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
the
money
is
not
owned
by
the
county.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
one
little
trouble
with
your
statute.
this
is
a
sentence
from
28.33:
"monies
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court
shall
be
deposited
in
interest-bearing
certificates."
now,
if
it
stopped
there,
there
would
be
compulsion
to
make
it
productive.
but
it
goes
on
to
say,
"at
the
discretion
of
the
clerk."
i
think
there
were
remarks
made
yesterday
that
there
was
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
clerk
to
invest.
what
do
the
words,
modify?
i
would
have
thought
on
first
reading
that
it
meant
that
he
had
discretion
in
the
investments
he
selected
and
not
in
the
duty,
whether
to
invest
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
is
a
mandate
to
invest
and--
unknown
speaker
--the
discretion
is
as
to
the
selection
of
the
investment?
unknown
speaker
i
think
there
were
remarks
made
yesterday,
perhaps
by
your
opponent,
that
there
was
no
duty
to
invest.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
told
us
that
this
morning.
you've
told
us
that
this
morning,
have
you
not,
that
there
is
no
duty
on
the
clerk
to
invest
the
monies
that
are
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
misunderstood
you,
then.
but
in
any
event
your
position
now
is
that
he
must
invest?
unknown
speaker
okay.
maybe
mr.
alper
will
have
something
else
to
say
on
that.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
then,
you
are
in
disagreement
on
this.
maybe
it
isn't
very
important,
but
i
take
it
there
is
no
authoritative
florida
decision?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
at
this
point,
suppose
these
were
clearly
county
funds,
wholly
apart
from
eckerd's
and
webb's
and
so
forth.
and
the
county
had
an
excess
of
funds,
$1
million.
must
the
clerk
invest
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
alper,
in
your
receivership
presumably
there
are
monies
invested
with
banks
or
in
securities
that
will
eventually
bring
some
return
over
and
above
the
principal
they
started
out
with.
now,
in
the
final
accounting
of
the
receivership,
won't
the
accountant
and
the
receiver
and
the
attorney
be
paid
right
off
the
top
to
the
frequent,
not
necessarily
detriment,
but
so
that
the
creditors
may
not
even
receive
their
entire
principal?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
possible,
though,
under
florida
receivership
statutes
or
any
other
receivership
statutes,
that
a
receiver,
accountant,
lawyer,
anyone
else
who
aids
in
the
costs
of
administration
of
a
bankrupt
estate
or
receivership
estate
will
get
paid
first
so
that
the
creditors
get
only
a
portion
of
the
principal
and
no
interest,
even
though
there
may
have
been
interest
earned?
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
very
narrow
question,
then,
here
today
and,
from
your
point
of
view,
a
very
simple
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
haven't
we
held
for
a
long
time
that
the
republican
form
of
government
version
in
the
constitution
is
a
political
one
and
not
capable
of
judicial
enforcement?
unknown
speaker
was
the
constitutional
issue
raised
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
all
the
court
speaks
of
is
just
plain
constitutionality,
and...
as
i
read
your
appendix
and
jurisdictional
statement.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
a
lawsuit
was
involved
if
there's
a
deposit
in
the
registry
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
complaining
about
that?
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
complied
with
this
statute
by
depositing
in
kind
the
equivalent
amount
in
high
yield
government
bonds?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
getting
something,
though,
for
this
money
that's
being
held,
that
is
being
taken
by
the
clerk.
you're
getting
a
depositary
that
is
probably
absolutely
liable
in
the
event
of
theft
or
negligent
loss.
at
least
i've
looked
at
a
florida
case
that
would
suggest
that.
unknown
speaker
and
not
on
the
county
or
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
won't
burden
you
with
any
case
citations
because
i
don't
claim
to
be
an
authority
on
florida
law,
but
the
paragraph
which
i
have
found
in
florida
jurisprudence,
2d,
says,
"court
clerks
are
generally
required
by
statute
to
account
for
all
money
received
by
them
as
public
officers."
"it
would
appear
therefore
that
such
clerks
are
unconditionally
liable
as
insurers
for
the
loss
of
money
that
comes
into
their
hands
because
the
statutory
duty
to
account
is
an
absolute
one."
"thus,
an
action
may
be
brought
against
a
court
clerk
by
a
county
in
the
event
that
a
clerk
unlawfully
withholds
funds
from
it."
unknown
speaker
are
they
in
your
briefs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
that
you're
so
much
different.
those
cases
deal
with
loss,
not
by
the
clerk
but
by
somebody
else.
the
bank
failed.
he
put
them
in
the
bank,
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
he
himself
lost
it
he
would
still
be
absolutely
liable.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
law
didn't
require
an
investment
of
funds
in
the
court's
hands
and
the
court
didn't
invest?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
law
didn't
require
an
investment
but
the
clerk
did
invest
and
earned
interest?
then
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
claim,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
if
an
order
requires
investment
and
he
does
invest,
that
you
are
not
only
entitled
to
the
interest
but
to
the
best
interest
the
clerk
could
have
gotten?
unknown
speaker
sort
of
a
prudent
man
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
he
went
into
high
yield
governments,
he'd
be
on
pretty
safe--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there
is
a
federal
interpleader
act.
does
that
require
that
the
money
paid
into
court,
that
interest
be
paid
on
it?
unknown
speaker
where
the
clerk
has
in
fact
invested--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
what
if
under
a
particular
statute
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
court
or
clerk
invest
it
and
all
you
got
back
was
the
principal,
would
you
make
your
same
constitutional
arguments?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
a
new
rule
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
well,
had
the
florida
courts
held
to
this
effect
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
initiated
the
case
and
put
the
money
in
the
court?
unknown
speaker
how
did
they
know
to
do
that?
had
the
creditors--
unknown
speaker
--but
how,
under
that
section...
is
it
perfectly
clear
to
everybody...
the
law
doesn't
require
anybody
to
go
through
this
procedure,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
one
way
also
where
the
creditors
can
be
protected.
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
case...
suppose
this
decision
had
been
made
by
the
florida
courts
ten
years
ago,
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
what
the
florida
law
was.
receiver's
monies
that
earn
money,
or
that
earn
interest,
the
interest
belongs
to
the
public,
belongs
to
the
court.
suppose
that
had
been
the
question
ruled
before
this
case
was
ever
started?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
does
provide
exactly
what
mr.
justice
white
suggests
in
his
question,
and
how
long
has
the
statute
been
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
so,
for
seven
or
eight
years,
this
has
been
the
law
of
florida,
so
far
as
the
statutory
law
goes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
further
says
that
"all
interest
accruing
from
monies
deposited
shall
be
deemed
income
of
the
office
of
the
clerk."
unknown
speaker
then
it
says,
if
he
does
do
that,
the
income
shall
be
his,
the
court's,
or
the
property
of
the
county.
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
other
device
to
accomplish
this
protection
for
the
purchaser
and
the
protection
of
the
creditors?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
you
have
two
ways
of
doing,
performing,
reaching
some
end,
and
one
of
them
requires
sacrificing
the
interest
and
the
other
one
doesn't,
then
you
choose
the
former.
are
you
going
to
say
that
the
state
is
committing
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
it
says
"will
provide"...
and
will
provide
this
mechanism
to
perform
this
distribution,
but
the
only
thing
is
that
we're
going
to
keep
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
could
have
gone
to
a
title
company
or
a
bank
and
deposited
the
money
with
them?
you
didn't
have
to
deposit
it
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
order
to--
--it
could
even
have
been
in
federal
bankruptcy,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
if
what?
it's
optional,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
they
didn't
make
any
election?
the
claimants
didn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
your
argument
spill
over
very
largely
into
the
probate
field
too,
where
there
are
frequently
funds
temporarily
held
in
the
custody
of
the
court?
wouldn't
it
require
radical
revision
of
some
of
the
probate
procedures
in
the
various
states?
unknown
speaker
now
suppose
that
fee
were
not
on
the
statute,
would
your
case
be
different?
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
think
this...
a
creditor
could
have
put
this
seller
into
involuntary
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
come
the
property
then...
i
thought
that
the
bankruptcy
court
inherited
the
bankrupt's
property.
unknown
speaker
because
if
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
took
over,
then
the
bankruptcy
rules
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
did
any
creditor
try
to
protect
himself
from
this
florida
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
would
think
they
would,
but
they
didn't
attempt
to
avoid
the
application
of
this
texas
provision
by
precipitating
a
bankruptcy
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
have
satisfied
the
statute
if
they
had
deposited
the
equivalent
amount
in
high
yield
government,
united
states
government
bonds?
unknown
speaker
then
what
would
the
clerk
be
doing
to
earn
all
this
interest
for
himself?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
clerk
gets
quite
a
large
fee
under
this
florida
supreme
court
decision,
or
he
gets
a
yield,
a
return
for
holding
this
money.
now,
if
they
had
deposited
that
amount
in
government
bonds,
all
he
would
have
had
to
do
was
put
it
in
a
safe
deposit
box
in
the
best
bank
and
once
in
a
while
go
down
and
cut
coupons.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
to
the
clerk,
but
it
goes
to...
it
doesn't
go
to
the
creditors
or
the
principals
involved
in
the
transaction,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is...
by
giving
it
a
name
the
court
can't
make
it
so,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
statute
said
that
in
a
proceeding
of
this
type
the
money
held
shall
be
deemed
to
be
held
by
the
individual,
shall
be
deemed
to
be
public
money
and
the
interest
shall
be
paid
to
the
county?
would
that
be
your
idea
of
due
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
say
you
are
begging
the
question
in
answering
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
$1.8
million
could
be
considered
property.
don't
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
that
in
a
proceeding
of
this
type
the
holder
of
the
$1.8
million
shall
be
from
this
moment
on
holding
government
money,
public
money,
the
interest
of
which
shall
be
paid
to
the
government.
would
that
be
due
process?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
due
process,
then
you
win.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
interest
become
public
money?
unknown
speaker
oh,
because
florida
law
says
so.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
said
that
the
principal
also
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
florida?
would
that
be
consistent
with
the
takings
clause?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
property.
unknown
speaker
let
me
pursue
that,
then.
if
a
client
deposits
some
money
with
a
lawyer
and
he
puts
it
in
an
account,
a
savings
account,
instead
of
just
a
non-interest
checking
account,
whose
property
is
the
interest
on
that
account?
does
it
belong
to
the
lawyer
or
the
client?
unknown
speaker
if
he
puts
it
in
the
savings
account
as
a
trust
account?
unknown
speaker
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
then...
but
you
don't
apply
that
proposition
of
law
here?
unknown
speaker
did
florida
law
require
that
this
money
be
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court
in
order
for
the
sale
which
the
parties
contemplated
to
be
completed?
or
could
they
have
gone
about
it
another
way?
unknown
speaker
but
you
also
want
the
other
fee
too?
unknown
speaker
you
also
want
the
$9,500
fee
too?
$9,200?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
funds
he
handles,
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
other
statutory
fee
also.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
put
a
question
to
either
you
or
your
friend
yesterday.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
that.
suppose
they
had
put,
deposited
physically
high
yield
government
bonds
paying
8,
9,
10
percent
and
there
were
no
services
that
needed
to
be
performed,
no
investment
of
the
property,
just
a
matter
of
keeping
them
in
a
secure
place,
the
florida
statute
would
operate
on
the
coupons
that
were
clipped?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
your
opponent
here
sues
here
on
behalf
of
the
receiver
for
the
creditors,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
he
is
the
receiver.
and
under
florida
law
does
his
fee
for
services
as
receiver
come
off
the
top,
so
to
speak,
regardless
of
whether
the
creditors
are
paid
in
full
or
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
state
may
simply
define
property
in
any
way
it
wants
to
free
of
any
inhibitions
of
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
here
there
was
interest,
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
there
was
in
fact
interest
even
though
he...
perhaps
the
clerk
of
the
court
was
not
under
any
duty
to
invest
the
monies
in
a
way
that
would
create
interest,
but
here
he
did.
unknown
speaker
so
we're
really
talking
about
to
whom
does
that
interest
constitutionally
belong,
when
in
fact
there
was
interest.
unknown
speaker
in
state
law,
the
state
legislature
can't
just
by
calling
something
public
money
take
private
property
without
compensation
for
it.
he
couldn't
just
take
somebody's
house
in
florida
and
say,
hereafter
john
jones'
house
will
be
public
property.
he's
just
got
to
pay
john
jones
if
he
wants
to
take
it,
under
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
doesn't
really
answer
the
problem
here
to
say,
well,
this
is
public
property,
does
it?
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
own
money
i
have
a
common
law
right
to
keep
it.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
i
have
a
common
law
right
to
keep
that
money
if
i
get
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
he
didn't
get
the
money.
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
yesterday
that
the
state
can
say
that
that
whole
$1.8
million,
the
state
can
take
that
if
they
want
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
it
was
public
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
he
take
the
interest?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
created
the
interest?
unknown
speaker
and
the
vehicle
was
the
taking
of
the
property,
the
$1.8
million.
unknown
speaker
who
owned
that
$1.8
million
during
the
time?
unknown
speaker
and
when
it
was
put
in
the
registry
of
the
bank,
it
became
state
property.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was,
it
became
state
property?
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
state
property
can
the
state
not
take?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
it's
not
really
the
state's
property
to
do
what
it
wants
with
it,
is
it?
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
can
do
one
thing,
it
can
take
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
the
state
have
said
that
you
could
do
it?
that
you
could
collect
the
interest
on
that
property
and
keep
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
and
you
paid
$9,000
for
that.
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
and
in
addition
to
that
you...
i
hate
to
use
the
word...
confiscate
the
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do,
is
"cheat"?
unknown
speaker
well,
"take".
is
"take"
a
good
word?
unknown
speaker
the
interest
wasn't
taken?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
interest
taken?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statutory
requirements?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
statute
in
appendix
b
to
your
opponent's
brief,
investment
accounting
funds...
28.33,
which
provides
that
the
clerk
shall
make
an
estimate
of
his
projected
financial
needs
and
shall
invest
funds
in
designated
depositories.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
funds
described
in
that
statute
include
those
funds
that
a
private
party
deposits
with
the
clerk.
does
it
therefore
mean
that
the
clerk
could
use
those
funds
for
the
general
purposes
of
the
county?
because
they
come
within
the
statutory
description
of
all
funds
subject
to
his
control,
which
are
to
be
invested
in
a
particular
way?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
what's
to
prohibit
that?
unknown
speaker
more
specifically,
could
he
commingle
those
funds
with
county
funds?
and
if
not,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
this
statute
doesn't
require
separate
accounting
for
deposited
funds.
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
more
statutes
that
control
this
case
than
the
one
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
could
the
clerk
make
any
use
of
the
money
that's
deposited
with
him,
other
than
to
earn
interest
by
it,
by
its
deposit?
unknown
speaker
could
he
pledge
it
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
but
he
can
make
one
use
of
the
private
parties'
funds?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
do
you
happen
to
know,
because
i
don't
find
in
the
briefs,
the
citation
of
the
florida
statute
that
requires
the
clerk
to
keep
these
funds
separate?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
cited
in
the
briefs
or
the
opinion
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
had
had
a
million
dollars,
in
whatever
of
the
50
states
he
was,
a
state
court
couldn't
conclusively
characterize
it
as
public
money,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
there
comes
a
point
at
which
it
is
property
whether
the
state
court
says
it's
property
or
not.
unknown
speaker
the
one
thing
that's
clear
is
that
it's
not
owned
by
the
clerk
of
the
court,
isn't
it?
that
much
is
clear.
unknown
speaker
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
the
money
is
not
owned
by
the
county.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
one
little
trouble
with
your
statute.
this
is
a
sentence
from
28.33:
"monies
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court
shall
be
deposited
in
interest-bearing
certificates."
now,
if
it
stopped
there,
there
would
be
compulsion
to
make
it
productive.
but
it
goes
on
to
say,
"at
the
discretion
of
the
clerk."
i
think
there
were
remarks
made
yesterday
that
there
was
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
clerk
to
invest.
what
do
the
words,
modify?
i
would
have
thought
on
first
reading
that
it
meant
that
he
had
discretion
in
the
investments
he
selected
and
not
in
the
duty,
whether
to
invest
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
is
a
mandate
to
invest
and--
unknown
speaker
--the
discretion
is
as
to
the
selection
of
the
investment?
unknown
speaker
i
think
there
were
remarks
made
yesterday,
perhaps
by
your
opponent,
that
there
was
no
duty
to
invest.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
told
us
that
this
morning.
you've
told
us
that
this
morning,
have
you
not,
that
there
is
no
duty
on
the
clerk
to
invest
the
monies
that
are
paid
into
the
registry
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
misunderstood
you,
then.
but
in
any
event
your
position
now
is
that
he
must
invest?
unknown
speaker
okay.
maybe
mr.
alper
will
have
something
else
to
say
on
that.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
then,
you
are
in
disagreement
on
this.
maybe
it
isn't
very
important,
but
i
take
it
there
is
no
authoritative
florida
decision?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
at
this
point,
suppose
these
were
clearly
county
funds,
wholly
apart
from
eckerd's
and
webb's
and
so
forth.
and
the
county
had
an
excess
of
funds,
$1
million.
must
the
clerk
invest
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
alper,
in
your
receivership
presumably
there
are
monies
invested
with
banks
or
in
securities
that
will
eventually
bring
some
return
over
and
above
the
principal
they
started
out
with.
now,
in
the
final
accounting
of
the
receivership,
won't
the
accountant
and
the
receiver
and
the
attorney
be
paid
right
off
the
top
to
the
frequent,
not
necessarily
detriment,
but
so
that
the
creditors
may
not
even
receive
their
entire
principal?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
possible,
though,
under
florida
receivership
statutes
or
any
other
receivership
statutes,
that
a
receiver,
accountant,
lawyer,
anyone
else
who
aids
in
the
costs
of
administration
of
a
bankrupt
estate
or
receivership
estate
will
get
paid
first
so
that
the
creditors
get
only
a
portion
of
the
principal
and
no
interest,
even
though
there
may
have
been
interest
earned?
