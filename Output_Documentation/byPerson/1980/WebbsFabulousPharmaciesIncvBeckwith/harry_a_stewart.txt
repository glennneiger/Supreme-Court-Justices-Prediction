mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
basically
did
two
things.
the
first
thing
it
did
was
it
authorized
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
to
deposit
monies
that
were
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
interest-bearing
accounts.
the
second
thing--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--florida
law
authorizes
that;
yes.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
however,
this
is
not
money
that
necessarily
goes
to
the
clerk,
according
to
the--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
it
does
not.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
specifically
found
the
second
part
of
the
statute
that
created
the
interest,
that
gave
the
clerk
the
authority,
which
he
did
not
have
before
and
could
not
invest
without
such
authority,
once
they
gave
him
that
authority,
the
second
part
of
that
statute
dictated
the
disposition
of
the
funds,
the
interest
that
was
earned.
that,
and
as
i
will
point
out
later
on,
is
another
rule
applied
in
this
court
in
the
arnett
decision
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
which
says
that
one
cannot
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
an
important
part
of
the
act
while
claiming
rights
and
benefits
under
the
same
act.
and
that's
exactly
what's
being
done
here.
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
asking
that
the
clerk
be
allowed
to
put
the
interest
in,
just
like
the
act
says
and
without
the
act
he
couldn't
put
it
in.
but
he
is
saying
that
the
disposition
that
the
florida
legislature
made
of
the
funds
when
they
authorized
such
deposit
is
unconstitutional.
but
the
court
noted
that
it
was
the
statute
itself
that
created
the
authority
and
it
also
outlined
the
method
of
disposition.
the
court
found
as
a
matter
of
law
in
florida
that
these
funds
are
considered
public
funds
and
they
are
not
private
funds.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
precisely
the
issue.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
the
due
process
as
you
are
outlining
it
is
going
to
have
to
have
some
property
attached
to
it
before
you
can
apply
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
receiver
and
appellant
in
this
case
is
begging
the
question.
he
is
saying,
first,
i
have
property
and
i've
been
deprived
of
it--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
you
have
got
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
property
to
begin
with,
and
that's
what
this
statute
says
that
it
is
not
private
property.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
i
believe
it
would,
because
you
are
creating
the
very--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--you
are
creating
the
property
which
you
are
ultimately
disposing
of.
the
$1.8
million
is
not
in
question,
it's
the
interest
earned
on
that
property.
the
$1.8
million
was
paid
back
out.
if
fact,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
statutory
scheme
in
florida
was
that
the
money
be
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court,
the
clerk
would
earn
interest
on
those
monies,
those
monies
became
public
monies...
the
interest
only.
the
court,
after
one
year,
when
it
went
in,
the
court
knew
of
the
clerk's
claim.
after
one
year
that
money
came
out
of
the
registry
of
the
court
and
went
into
the
hands
of
the
receiver
and
was
invested
wherever
he
invested
it.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
because
florida
law--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--defines
property.
and
you've
got
to
look
to
some
manifestation
of
enactment
of
a
state
legislature
to
determine
what
your
property
rights
are.
florida
law
said,
when
you
turn
money
over
to
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court,
he
is
ultimately
responsible
for
that
money.
that
money
becomes
public
money.
they
authorize
interest
to
earned
on
that
money
and
the
interest
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
florida.
that's
florida
law.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no.
that
would...
well--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
money
going
in
is
property;
it
is
something
that
the
person
has
a
right
to,
they're
turning
it
over
to
the
court.
they
have
a
right
to
get
it
back,
but
they
have
no
right,
no
unilateral
expectation
to
earn
interest.
there's
no
common
law
right
to
earn
interest
on
monies,
otherwise
every
lawyer
in
the
united
states
would
have
a
very
serious
problem
with
his
trust
fund,
if
his
client
came
in
and
demanded
interest.
there's
no
statutory
requirement
that
they
pay
interest
on
trust
fund
monies.
there's
no
authority
for
the
clerk
to
invest
those
monies
and
earn
interest
in
the
state
of
florida
unless
he
has
statutory
authority,
which
the
statute
gives
him
and
at
the
same
time
says
where
the
interest
goes,
and
characterizes
that
interest
as
public
monies.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
those
monies...
under
florida
law
you
may
not
do
that.
he
has
misappropriated
that
money
and
can
be
held
liable.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
unless
he
pays
the
interest
of
that
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
to
the
owner
of
the
principal.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
but
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
him
to
invest
those
funds.
in
fact,
he's
precluded
from
doing
so.
but
if
he
does,
he
has
misappropriated
that
money
unless
that
money,
the
interest
earned,
goes
to
the
owner
of
the
principal.
but
that's
under
florida
law.
i
want
to
point
out,
again,
that
it's
very
important
that
you've
got
to
look
to
the
enactment
of
the
state
legislature
to
define
what
property
is
here.
and
the
florida
legislature
has
said
that
interest
earned
on
monies
in
the
registry
of
the
court
is
not
private
monies
but
public
monies.
this--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--they
not
only
could
have
gone
about
it
another
way,
after
one
year
they
did
go
about
it
another
way.
they
took
the
money
out
of
the
registry
of
the
court
and
turned
it
over
to
the
receiver
who
invested
the
money,
at
the
direction
of
the
court,
and
the
interest
earned
for
the
next
several
years
became
property
of
the
ultimate
owners
of
the
principal.
but
if
the
court
utilizes
the
statutory
vehicle
which
is
provided
to
earn
interest
on
that
money
through
the
clerk
of
the
court,
then
they've
got
to
use
the
statutory
vehicle
that
that
same
statute
requires
for
the
disposition
of
the
interest
earned.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
excuse
me?
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
that's
an
entirely
different
fee
for
the
setting
up
of
the
account
and
for
the
disposition
of
the
case
itself.
that's
a
separate
fee.
in
this
case,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
clerk
is
absolutely
liable
for
mishandling
of
the
funds.
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
funds
that
he
handles,
the
more
liability
he
incurs.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
that's
under
florida
law.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
this
court
that
we
started
yesterday
presents
a
very
simple
question.
that
question,
is
interest
earned
on
money
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
the
state
of
florida
private
property
which
can
be
afforded
the
protections
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution?
construing
florida
law,
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
no,
that
it
is
not
private
property,
that
it
is
in
fact
public
monies,
referring
to
the
interest.
there
is
no
common
law
right
to
earn
interest
on
monies.
if
you
earn
interest
on
money,
you've
got
to
look
to
a
statutory
right
or
a
contractual
right.
the
general
rule
is
that
if
interest
is
earned,
it
will
follow
the
principal
unless
otherwise
provided.
florida
provides
otherwise.
the
statutory
scheme
in
florida
says
that
the
government
will
benefit
from
that
interest
and
it
will
go
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people.
that
statutory
scheme
does
not
interfere
with
the
judiciary
in
any
way.
it
does
not
present
any
anti-republican
problems
for
this
court
to
be
considering.
in
the
jurisdictional
brief
that
i
presented
to
this
court,
i
represented
that
that
particular
argument
raised
by
appellant,
that
it
violates
the
separation
of
powers,
was
not
properly
raised
before
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
question
must
be
specifically
raised
and
stated
with
specificity.
the
question
before
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
one
that
they
answered
in
paragraph
5
of
their
opinion
stated
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
was
not
violated
as
it
applied
to
the
florida
constitution.
the
allegations
made
were
that
the
separation
of
powers
was
violated
according
to
the
florida
constitution
and
other
similar
provisions.
that
does
not
meet
the
rule
for
bringing
to
this
court
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
united
states
constitution.
the
cases
in
that
area,
however,
all
talk
about
one
branch
of
government
usurping
or
invading
the
powers
of
another
branch.
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
law
in
this
case
says
that
the
money
is
in
the
registry
of
the
court,
it
earns
interest,
and
that
interest
goes
to
the
county.
the
court
in
that
case
attempted
to
utilize
that
statutory
provision
by
picking
and
choosing
those
parts
that
it
liked
and
ignoring
the
parts
that
it
didn't
like.
if
there
were
any
usurpation
here,
it
was
by
the
judiciary
and
not
by
the
legislature.
the
court
finally
exercised
its
inherent
power,
took
the
money
out
of
the
registry
of
the
court,
put
it
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver,
where
then
the
interest
on
the
money,
on
the
principal
that
was
put
into
the
registry
of
the
court
in
this
interpleader
action,
went
to
those
people
who
were
ultimately
decided
to
be
the
owners
of
the
principal.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
it
applies
only
to
monies,
and
it
specifically
says,
monies.
if
it
were
held
in
custody,
simply
the
bonds,
the
physical
bonds
themselves,
whatever
coupons
would
accrue
or
interest
would
accrue
would
go
with
the
bonds.
but
if
money
is
deposited
and
the
statute
specifically
speaks
to
money,
then
interest
earned
on
that
money
must
go
to
the
county,
or
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
clerk
and
pass
it
through
to
the
county.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
my
opponent
here
is
the
receiver.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law;
yes,
sir.
the
problem
in
this
case
was,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
court
attempted
to
utilize
a
statutory
vehicle
selectively.
the
court
had
the
power,
the
inherent
power
all
the
time
to
put
the
money
with
the
receiver
and
earn
interest
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors.
if
equity
demands
it...
and
in
this
case
it
probably
did,
but
it
was
the
judge
who
didn't
take
action
until
one
year
after
the
monies
had
been
in
the
registry
of
the
court...
if
equity
demanded
that
interest
be
earned
on
as
huge
a
sum
of
money
as
this
was,
$1.8
million,
that
judge
should
have
at
that
time
not
left
the
money
in
the
registry
of
the
court
but
ordered
that
money
in
the
hands
of
a
receiver
to
earn
interest
for
the
beneficiaries,
for
the
creditors.
the
question
basically
is,
what
constitutes
property
rights?
this
court
in
1945
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
willow
river
power
corporation
indicated
that
not
all
economic
interests
are
property
rights.
only
those
economic
advantages
are
rights
which
are
backed
by
law.
the
case
most
often
cited
for
the
rationale
for
determining
property
rights
which
are
properly
protected
by
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
is
the
case
of
board
of
regents
v.
roth.
this
court
said
that
property
interests
are
not
created
by
the
constitution,
rather
they
are
created
and
their
dimensions
are
defined
by
existing
rules
or
understandings
that
stem
from
an
independent
source,
such
as
state
law.
in
this
regard
i
would
suggest
that
appellants'
brief
and
the
argument
before
this
court
is
more
important
for
what
it
does
not
say
than
for
what
it
does
say.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
but
i
believe
in
a
case
where
you
have
absolutely
no
common
law
rights,
where
you
must
look
to
a
statutory
right,
or
a
contractual
right,
that
that
would
be
the
case.
unless
there
was
a
common
law
right
to
property
that
you
can
show,
then
you
must
look
to
the
statutory
rights
which
would
be
created
by
the
state
legislature
or
some
contractual
right.
receiver
does
not
say
that
there
was
a
common
law
right
to
interest
because
there
is
no
common
law
right
to
interest.
he
does
not
point
to
a
federal
statute
which
allows
him
interest
or
gives
him
a
right
to
interest,
because
there
is
no
such
statute.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
yes,
there
certainly
was.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
there
was.
$92,000
worth.
that
sum
now
is
in
excess
of
$100,000
because
the
interest--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
that
wholly,
that
they
may
not
do
that.
in
this
case
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
what
we're
looking
for
is
a
definition
of
property
and
we're
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
cases
where
this
court
has
construed
that
definition
of
property.
if
i
own
a
home,
i
have
a
common
law
right.
there
is
a
right.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
you
have
no
common
law
right
to
earn
interest
on
that
money,
to
have
interest
paid
on
that
money.
you
have
a
statutory
right
and
a
contractual
right.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
you
do;
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is,
did
the
person
that
had
the
money--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
i
said
that
the
state
could
not
take
that
without
paying
just
compensation
for
it
because
that
is--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--because
there
is
no
right
to
earn
interest.
the
statute
created
the
interest.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
statute
created
the
vehicle
through
which
the
interest
was
earned.
without
the
statute--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
that
was
an
alternative
that
was
exercised--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--eckerd
of
college
park,
who
was
purchasing
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that
was
an
option
that
they
had,
to
put
it
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
interpleader,
which
they
did.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
according
to
florida
statute
that
became--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
not
without
just
compensation.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
real
property,
sir.
any
property
in
which
you
have
a
statutory
right,
any
real
property
or
any
property
defined
by
congress.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
question
here...
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
it
can
invest
that
money.
the
clerk
could
not
invest
that
money
without
statutory
authority.
we're
talking
about
interest
that
was
earned
that
may
not
otherwise
be
earned.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that
i
could
do
it?
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
well,
the
state
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
if
you
are
using
the
registry
of
the
court,
if
you
are
using
a
public
official,
when
you
give
that
public
official
money,
then
you
are
utilizing
that
state
public
official
and
that
that
money
becomes
public
money
and
he
is
responsible
for
that
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that
is
a
fee
that
you
must
pay,
yes.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
absolutely
not.
that's
not
a
proper
word
at
all.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
that's
not
a
proper
characterization
either.
a
proper
characterization
is--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--the
property
was
not
taken.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
interest
was
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court
to
be
public
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
money
was
put
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
justice
marshall,
by
eckerd
pharmacy.
that
was
an
option
they
had.
the
money
could
have
been
handled
by
the
bankruptcy
court;
the
money
could
have
been
handled
by
the
receiver
initially,
in
which
the
rules
of
the
court
would
apply...
in
the
former
the
rules
of
bankruptcy
would
apply.
they
opted
for
this
particular
remedy
and
when
they
do
they
must
follow
the
statutory
requirements
in
order
to
exercise
their
right
under
that
remedy.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no
sir,
he
may
not.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
funds
are
put
in,
into
the
registry
the
court
has.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
he
cannot
commingle
them
with
county
funds
which
may
be
spent
for
general
county
purposes--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--because
the
statute
specifically
requires
that
these
be
kept
in
a
separate
fund,
but
that
they
be
invested.
then,
at
the
end
of
every
year,
at
the
end
of
every
calendar
year--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no.
others
do.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
number
of
cases
have
been
cited
for
the
proposition
that
interest
should
go
to
the
successful
litigant.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
they
fall
into
two
categories.
one
is
that
there
is
no
state
or
federal
statute
involved,
and
in
that
case,
and
in
every
case
cited
where
they
fall
into
that
category,
the
courts
followed
the
general
rule,
that
is
the
interest
followed
the
principal.
that's
in
the
absence
of
a
state
or
federal
statute.
and
in
all
of
the
other
cases,
every
case
cited,
the
state
statutory
scheme
was
followed.
that
was
the
other
category;
it
was
where
the
cases
fall
where
there
is
a
statutory
scheme.
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
sellers
v.
harris
cited
by
appellant,
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
looked
at
two
articles
in
the
state
of
texas.
one
was
a
general...
characterized
and
i
quote,
"general
statute
on
public
monies".
the
other
was
a
comprehensive...
i
quote
again...
characterized
by
the
court
as
a
"comprehensive
statute"
for
handling
trust
funds.
the
court
in
that
case
decided
that
these
monies
are
trust
funds
and
applied
the
proper
statutory
scheme
to
them.
in
the
other
cases...
and,
for
instance,
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
v.
adams,
in
that
case
the
interest
didn't
go
to
the
successful
litigant.
the
interest
went
to
the
depositor
of
the
original
funds.
that
case...
if
that
case
were
followed,
the
person,
the
proper
party
to
get
the
interest
would
be
eckerd's,
not
the
receiver.
because
what
happened
there,
it
was
a
condemnation
case.
the
water
district
put
money
into
the
registry.
the
successful
litigants
were
those
people
whose
properties
were
taken;
they
took
their
money
out.
while
it
was
there
it
earned
interest.
it
didn't
go
to
the
property
owners.
it
went
back
to
the
water
district.
that
was
the
court's
version
in
metropolitan
water
district.
and
the
other
cases
are
the
same.
the
court
found
a
statutory
scheme
to
follow
and
they
followed
such
a
scheme.
appellant
has
shown
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
in
the
absence
of
a
general
statute.
he
has
cited
various
states
to
show
how
the
states
handle
the
same
problem.
it
becomes
painfully
obvious
that
state
statutory
schemes
vary
quite
broadly,
just
as
property
rights
vary
from
state
to
state.
water
right,
for
instance,
in
texas,
are...
almost--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
right
off
hand
i
do
not.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
at
the
time
that
was
really
not
a
question.
the
question
was...
that
we
have
addressed,
i
believe,
exhaustively...
is
whether
it
is
property
or
not,
to
make
that
determination.
i
believe
that's
the
key
here.
but
again,
property
rights
in
the
various
states
vary
widely.
for
instance,
as
i
pointed
out,
water
rights
in
texas
are
almost
diametrically
opposed
to
the
same
right
in
florida.
appellant
wasn't
in
a
texas
court,
he
wasn't
in
a
california
court,
he
wasn't
in
an
oregon
court,
he
was
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
that
court
characterized
the
money
under
florida
law
as
public
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
this
is
pre-judgment.
there's
no
determination
as
yet
by
the
court
as
to
who
owns
the
money.
so
the
money
when
its
goes
into
the
registry
of
the
court
in
that
instance
is
pre-judgment.
all
of
the
cases
that
say
that
interest
goes
to
the
owner
of
the
fund,
they
are
post-judgments,
where
the
principal
has
been
determined
and
the
court
is
holding
it
for
the
owner.
in
those
cases
interest--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has
said
what
constitutes
property
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
court
has
said
that
it's
a
matter
for
the
states
to
determine.
florida
has
characterized
the
money
in
question
here
as
public
and
not
private,
and
therefore
found
no
taking.
this
court
should
respect
the
right
of
the
florida
legislature
and
the
florida
supreme
court
to
say
what
is
property
in
florida.
florida
law
creates
the
property,
the
u.s.
constitution
protects
the
property,
not
vice
versa.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
my
interpretation
and
i
believe
the
court's,
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
interpretation
of
that
statute,
that
he
shall
invest
the
money.
the
discretion
is
where
he
invests
it.
there
are
a
number
of
things
under
florida
law
that
allows
him
to
invest
it
in
different
types
of
securities,
in
bonds
or--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
the
modification--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i
believe
you're
correct.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
statute
says
he
shall,
and
then
it's
modified,
with
the
modification
i
believe
as
to
the
clause
that
follows,
and
that
is
where
the
monies
get
invested.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
basically
did
two
things.
the
first
thing
it
did
was
it
authorized
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
to
deposit
monies
that
were
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
interest-bearing
accounts.
the
second
thing--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--florida
law
authorizes
that;
yes.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
however,
this
is
not
money
that
necessarily
goes
to
the
clerk,
according
to
the--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
it
does
not.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
specifically
found
the
second
part
of
the
statute
that
created
the
interest,
that
gave
the
clerk
the
authority,
which
he
did
not
have
before
and
could
not
invest
without
such
authority,
once
they
gave
him
that
authority,
the
second
part
of
that
statute
dictated
the
disposition
of
the
funds,
the
interest
that
was
earned.
that,
and
as
i
will
point
out
later
on,
is
another
rule
applied
in
this
court
in
the
arnett
decision
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
which
says
that
one
cannot
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
an
important
part
of
the
act
while
claiming
rights
and
benefits
under
the
same
act.
and
that's
exactly
what's
being
done
here.
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
asking
that
the
clerk
be
allowed
to
put
the
interest
in,
just
like
the
act
says
and
without
the
act
he
couldn't
put
it
in.
but
he
is
saying
that
the
disposition
that
the
florida
legislature
made
of
the
funds
when
they
authorized
such
deposit
is
unconstitutional.
but
the
court
noted
that
it
was
the
statute
itself
that
created
the
authority
and
it
also
outlined
the
method
of
disposition.
the
court
found
as
a
matter
of
law
in
florida
that
these
funds
are
considered
public
funds
and
they
are
not
private
funds.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
precisely
the
issue.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
the
due
process
as
you
are
outlining
it
is
going
to
have
to
have
some
property
attached
to
it
before
you
can
apply
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
receiver
and
appellant
in
this
case
is
begging
the
question.
he
is
saying,
first,
i
have
property
and
i've
been
deprived
of
it--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
you
have
got
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
property
to
begin
with,
and
that's
what
this
statute
says
that
it
is
not
private
property.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
i
believe
it
would,
because
you
are
creating
the
very--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--you
are
creating
the
property
which
you
are
ultimately
disposing
of.
the
$1.8
million
is
not
in
question,
it's
the
interest
earned
on
that
property.
the
$1.8
million
was
paid
back
out.
if
fact,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
statutory
scheme
in
florida
was
that
the
money
be
deposited
in
the
registry
of
the
court,
the
clerk
would
earn
interest
on
those
monies,
those
monies
became
public
monies...
the
interest
only.
the
court,
after
one
year,
when
it
went
in,
the
court
knew
of
the
clerk's
claim.
after
one
year
that
money
came
out
of
the
registry
of
the
court
and
went
into
the
hands
of
the
receiver
and
was
invested
wherever
he
invested
it.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
because
florida
law--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--defines
property.
and
you've
got
to
look
to
some
manifestation
of
enactment
of
a
state
legislature
to
determine
what
your
property
rights
are.
florida
law
said,
when
you
turn
money
over
to
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court,
he
is
ultimately
responsible
for
that
money.
that
money
becomes
public
money.
they
authorize
interest
to
earned
on
that
money
and
the
interest
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
florida.
that's
florida
law.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no.
that
would...
well--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
the
money
going
in
is
property;
it
is
something
that
the
person
has
a
right
to,
they're
turning
it
over
to
the
court.
they
have
a
right
to
get
it
back,
but
they
have
no
right,
no
unilateral
expectation
to
earn
interest.
there's
no
common
law
right
to
earn
interest
on
monies,
otherwise
every
lawyer
in
the
united
states
would
have
a
very
serious
problem
with
his
trust
fund,
if
his
client
came
in
and
demanded
interest.
there's
no
statutory
requirement
that
they
pay
interest
on
trust
fund
monies.
there's
no
authority
for
the
clerk
to
invest
those
monies
and
earn
interest
in
the
state
of
florida
unless
he
has
statutory
authority,
which
the
statute
gives
him
and
at
the
same
time
says
where
the
interest
goes,
and
characterizes
that
interest
as
public
monies.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
those
monies...
under
florida
law
you
may
not
do
that.
he
has
misappropriated
that
money
and
can
be
held
liable.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
unless
he
pays
the
interest
of
that
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
to
the
owner
of
the
principal.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
but
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
him
to
invest
those
funds.
in
fact,
he's
precluded
from
doing
so.
but
if
he
does,
he
has
misappropriated
that
money
unless
that
money,
the
interest
earned,
goes
to
the
owner
of
the
principal.
but
that's
under
florida
law.
i
want
to
point
out,
again,
that
it's
very
important
that
you've
got
to
look
to
the
enactment
of
the
state
legislature
to
define
what
property
is
here.
and
the
florida
legislature
has
said
that
interest
earned
on
monies
in
the
registry
of
the
court
is
not
private
monies
but
public
monies.
this--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--they
not
only
could
have
gone
about
it
another
way,
after
one
year
they
did
go
about
it
another
way.
they
took
the
money
out
of
the
registry
of
the
court
and
turned
it
over
to
the
receiver
who
invested
the
money,
at
the
direction
of
the
court,
and
the
interest
earned
for
the
next
several
years
became
property
of
the
ultimate
owners
of
the
principal.
but
if
the
court
utilizes
the
statutory
vehicle
which
is
provided
to
earn
interest
on
that
money
through
the
clerk
of
the
court,
then
they've
got
to
use
the
statutory
vehicle
that
that
same
statute
requires
for
the
disposition
of
the
interest
earned.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
excuse
me?
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
that's
an
entirely
different
fee
for
the
setting
up
of
the
account
and
for
the
disposition
of
the
case
itself.
that's
a
separate
fee.
in
this
case,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
clerk
is
absolutely
liable
for
mishandling
of
the
funds.
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
funds
that
he
handles,
the
more
liability
he
incurs.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
that's
under
florida
law.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
this
court
that
we
started
yesterday
presents
a
very
simple
question.
that
question,
is
interest
earned
on
money
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
the
state
of
florida
private
property
which
can
be
afforded
the
protections
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution?
construing
florida
law,
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
no,
that
it
is
not
private
property,
that
it
is
in
fact
public
monies,
referring
to
the
interest.
there
is
no
common
law
right
to
earn
interest
on
monies.
if
you
earn
interest
on
money,
you've
got
to
look
to
a
statutory
right
or
a
contractual
right.
the
general
rule
is
that
if
interest
is
earned,
it
will
follow
the
principal
unless
otherwise
provided.
florida
provides
otherwise.
the
statutory
scheme
in
florida
says
that
the
government
will
benefit
from
that
interest
and
it
will
go
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people.
that
statutory
scheme
does
not
interfere
with
the
judiciary
in
any
way.
it
does
not
present
any
anti-republican
problems
for
this
court
to
be
considering.
in
the
jurisdictional
brief
that
i
presented
to
this
court,
i
represented
that
that
particular
argument
raised
by
appellant,
that
it
violates
the
separation
of
powers,
was
not
properly
raised
before
the
florida
supreme
court.
the
question
must
be
specifically
raised
and
stated
with
specificity.
the
question
before
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
one
that
they
answered
in
paragraph
5
of
their
opinion
stated
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
was
not
violated
as
it
applied
to
the
florida
constitution.
the
allegations
made
were
that
the
separation
of
powers
was
violated
according
to
the
florida
constitution
and
other
similar
provisions.
that
does
not
meet
the
rule
for
bringing
to
this
court
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
united
states
constitution.
the
cases
in
that
area,
however,
all
talk
about
one
branch
of
government
usurping
or
invading
the
powers
of
another
branch.
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
law
in
this
case
says
that
the
money
is
in
the
registry
of
the
court,
it
earns
interest,
and
that
interest
goes
to
the
county.
the
court
in
that
case
attempted
to
utilize
that
statutory
provision
by
picking
and
choosing
those
parts
that
it
liked
and
ignoring
the
parts
that
it
didn't
like.
if
there
were
any
usurpation
here,
it
was
by
the
judiciary
and
not
by
the
legislature.
the
court
finally
exercised
its
inherent
power,
took
the
money
out
of
the
registry
of
the
court,
put
it
in
the
hands
of
the
receiver,
where
then
the
interest
on
the
money,
on
the
principal
that
was
put
into
the
registry
of
the
court
in
this
interpleader
action,
went
to
those
people
who
were
ultimately
decided
to
be
the
owners
of
the
principal.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
it
applies
only
to
monies,
and
it
specifically
says,
monies.
if
it
were
held
in
custody,
simply
the
bonds,
the
physical
bonds
themselves,
whatever
coupons
would
accrue
or
interest
would
accrue
would
go
with
the
bonds.
but
if
money
is
deposited
and
the
statute
specifically
speaks
to
money,
then
interest
earned
on
that
money
must
go
to
the
county,
or
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
clerk
and
pass
it
through
to
the
county.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
my
opponent
here
is
the
receiver.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law;
yes,
sir.
the
problem
in
this
case
was,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
court
attempted
to
utilize
a
statutory
vehicle
selectively.
the
court
had
the
power,
the
inherent
power
all
the
time
to
put
the
money
with
the
receiver
and
earn
interest
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors.
if
equity
demands
it...
and
in
this
case
it
probably
did,
but
it
was
the
judge
who
didn't
take
action
until
one
year
after
the
monies
had
been
in
the
registry
of
the
court...
if
equity
demanded
that
interest
be
earned
on
as
huge
a
sum
of
money
as
this
was,
$1.8
million,
that
judge
should
have
at
that
time
not
left
the
money
in
the
registry
of
the
court
but
ordered
that
money
in
the
hands
of
a
receiver
to
earn
interest
for
the
beneficiaries,
for
the
creditors.
the
question
basically
is,
what
constitutes
property
rights?
this
court
in
1945
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
willow
river
power
corporation
indicated
that
not
all
economic
interests
are
property
rights.
only
those
economic
advantages
are
rights
which
are
backed
by
law.
the
case
most
often
cited
for
the
rationale
for
determining
property
rights
which
are
properly
protected
by
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
is
the
case
of
board
of
regents
v.
roth.
this
court
said
that
property
interests
are
not
created
by
the
constitution,
rather
they
are
created
and
their
dimensions
are
defined
by
existing
rules
or
understandings
that
stem
from
an
independent
source,
such
as
state
law.
in
this
regard
i
would
suggest
that
appellants'
brief
and
the
argument
before
this
court
is
more
important
for
what
it
does
not
say
than
for
what
it
does
say.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
but
i
believe
in
a
case
where
you
have
absolutely
no
common
law
rights,
where
you
must
look
to
a
statutory
right,
or
a
contractual
right,
that
that
would
be
the
case.
unless
there
was
a
common
law
right
to
property
that
you
can
show,
then
you
must
look
to
the
statutory
rights
which
would
be
created
by
the
state
legislature
or
some
contractual
right.
receiver
does
not
say
that
there
was
a
common
law
right
to
interest
because
there
is
no
common
law
right
to
interest.
he
does
not
point
to
a
federal
statute
which
allows
him
interest
or
gives
him
a
right
to
interest,
because
there
is
no
such
statute.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
yes,
there
certainly
was.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
there
was.
$92,000
worth.
that
sum
now
is
in
excess
of
$100,000
because
the
interest--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
with
that
wholly,
that
they
may
not
do
that.
in
this
case
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
what
we're
looking
for
is
a
definition
of
property
and
we're
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
cases
where
this
court
has
construed
that
definition
of
property.
if
i
own
a
home,
i
have
a
common
law
right.
there
is
a
right.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
you
have
no
common
law
right
to
earn
interest
on
that
money,
to
have
interest
paid
on
that
money.
you
have
a
statutory
right
and
a
contractual
right.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
you
do;
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is,
did
the
person
that
had
the
money--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
i
said
that
the
state
could
not
take
that
without
paying
just
compensation
for
it
because
that
is--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--because
there
is
no
right
to
earn
interest.
the
statute
created
the
interest.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
statute
created
the
vehicle
through
which
the
interest
was
earned.
without
the
statute--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
that
was
an
alternative
that
was
exercised--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--eckerd
of
college
park,
who
was
purchasing
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that
was
an
option
that
they
had,
to
put
it
in
the
registry
of
the
court
in
interpleader,
which
they
did.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir,
according
to
florida
statute
that
became--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
not
without
just
compensation.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
real
property,
sir.
any
property
in
which
you
have
a
statutory
right,
any
real
property
or
any
property
defined
by
congress.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
question
here...
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
it
can
invest
that
money.
the
clerk
could
not
invest
that
money
without
statutory
authority.
we're
talking
about
interest
that
was
earned
that
may
not
otherwise
be
earned.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that
i
could
do
it?
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
well,
the
state
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
that
if
you
are
using
the
registry
of
the
court,
if
you
are
using
a
public
official,
when
you
give
that
public
official
money,
then
you
are
utilizing
that
state
public
official
and
that
that
money
becomes
public
money
and
he
is
responsible
for
that
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that
is
a
fee
that
you
must
pay,
yes.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
absolutely
not.
that's
not
a
proper
word
at
all.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
that's
not
a
proper
characterization
either.
a
proper
characterization
is--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--the
property
was
not
taken.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
interest
was
decided
by
the
florida
supreme
court
to
be
public
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
money
was
put
into
the
registry
of
the
court,
justice
marshall,
by
eckerd
pharmacy.
that
was
an
option
they
had.
the
money
could
have
been
handled
by
the
bankruptcy
court;
the
money
could
have
been
handled
by
the
receiver
initially,
in
which
the
rules
of
the
court
would
apply...
in
the
former
the
rules
of
bankruptcy
would
apply.
they
opted
for
this
particular
remedy
and
when
they
do
they
must
follow
the
statutory
requirements
in
order
to
exercise
their
right
under
that
remedy.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no
sir,
he
may
not.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
funds
are
put
in,
into
the
registry
the
court
has.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
he
cannot
commingle
them
with
county
funds
which
may
be
spent
for
general
county
purposes--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--because
the
statute
specifically
requires
that
these
be
kept
in
a
separate
fund,
but
that
they
be
invested.
then,
at
the
end
of
every
year,
at
the
end
of
every
calendar
year--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no.
others
do.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
number
of
cases
have
been
cited
for
the
proposition
that
interest
should
go
to
the
successful
litigant.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
they
fall
into
two
categories.
one
is
that
there
is
no
state
or
federal
statute
involved,
and
in
that
case,
and
in
every
case
cited
where
they
fall
into
that
category,
the
courts
followed
the
general
rule,
that
is
the
interest
followed
the
principal.
that's
in
the
absence
of
a
state
or
federal
statute.
and
in
all
of
the
other
cases,
every
case
cited,
the
state
statutory
scheme
was
followed.
that
was
the
other
category;
it
was
where
the
cases
fall
where
there
is
a
statutory
scheme.
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
sellers
v.
harris
cited
by
appellant,
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
looked
at
two
articles
in
the
state
of
texas.
one
was
a
general...
characterized
and
i
quote,
"general
statute
on
public
monies".
the
other
was
a
comprehensive...
i
quote
again...
characterized
by
the
court
as
a
"comprehensive
statute"
for
handling
trust
funds.
the
court
in
that
case
decided
that
these
monies
are
trust
funds
and
applied
the
proper
statutory
scheme
to
them.
in
the
other
cases...
and,
for
instance,
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
v.
adams,
in
that
case
the
interest
didn't
go
to
the
successful
litigant.
the
interest
went
to
the
depositor
of
the
original
funds.
that
case...
if
that
case
were
followed,
the
person,
the
proper
party
to
get
the
interest
would
be
eckerd's,
not
the
receiver.
because
what
happened
there,
it
was
a
condemnation
case.
the
water
district
put
money
into
the
registry.
the
successful
litigants
were
those
people
whose
properties
were
taken;
they
took
their
money
out.
while
it
was
there
it
earned
interest.
it
didn't
go
to
the
property
owners.
it
went
back
to
the
water
district.
that
was
the
court's
version
in
metropolitan
water
district.
and
the
other
cases
are
the
same.
the
court
found
a
statutory
scheme
to
follow
and
they
followed
such
a
scheme.
appellant
has
shown
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
in
the
absence
of
a
general
statute.
he
has
cited
various
states
to
show
how
the
states
handle
the
same
problem.
it
becomes
painfully
obvious
that
state
statutory
schemes
vary
quite
broadly,
just
as
property
rights
vary
from
state
to
state.
water
right,
for
instance,
in
texas,
are...
almost--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--no,
sir,
right
off
hand
i
do
not.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
at
the
time
that
was
really
not
a
question.
the
question
was...
that
we
have
addressed,
i
believe,
exhaustively...
is
whether
it
is
property
or
not,
to
make
that
determination.
i
believe
that's
the
key
here.
but
again,
property
rights
in
the
various
states
vary
widely.
for
instance,
as
i
pointed
out,
water
rights
in
texas
are
almost
diametrically
opposed
to
the
same
right
in
florida.
appellant
wasn't
in
a
texas
court,
he
wasn't
in
a
california
court,
he
wasn't
in
an
oregon
court,
he
was
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
that
court
characterized
the
money
under
florida
law
as
public
money.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
this
is
pre-judgment.
there's
no
determination
as
yet
by
the
court
as
to
who
owns
the
money.
so
the
money
when
its
goes
into
the
registry
of
the
court
in
that
instance
is
pre-judgment.
all
of
the
cases
that
say
that
interest
goes
to
the
owner
of
the
fund,
they
are
post-judgments,
where
the
principal
has
been
determined
and
the
court
is
holding
it
for
the
owner.
in
those
cases
interest--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
that's
correct.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has
said
what
constitutes
property
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
the
court
has
said
that
it's
a
matter
for
the
states
to
determine.
florida
has
characterized
the
money
in
question
here
as
public
and
not
private,
and
therefore
found
no
taking.
this
court
should
respect
the
right
of
the
florida
legislature
and
the
florida
supreme
court
to
say
what
is
property
in
florida.
florida
law
creates
the
property,
the
u.s.
constitution
protects
the
property,
not
vice
versa.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
my
interpretation
and
i
believe
the
court's,
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
interpretation
of
that
statute,
that
he
shall
invest
the
money.
the
discretion
is
where
he
invests
it.
there
are
a
number
of
things
under
florida
law
that
allows
him
to
invest
it
in
different
types
of
securities,
in
bonds
or--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
yes,
sir.
the
modification--
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
--i
believe
you're
correct.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
harry
a.
stewart
the
statute
says
he
shall,
and
then
it's
modified,
with
the
modification
i
believe
as
to
the
clause
that
follows,
and
that
is
where
the
monies
get
invested.
