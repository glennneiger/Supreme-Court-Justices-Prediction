mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
litigant
nor
lower
court
has
challenged
the
existence
of
an
undisputed
emergency
crisis
situation
which
prompted
the
executive's
action
here.
thus
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
the
executive
generally
may
settle
the
claims
of
united
states
nationals
against
foreign
states,
although
historically
he's
done
so.
rather
the
question
is
a
narrower
one
dealing
with
whether
he
may
do
so
in
such
an
international
crisis.
put
this
way,
the
question
highlights
the
reason
why
the
executive's
power
to
settle
claims
both
historically
and
doctrinally
has
been
held
to
be
a
necessary
element
of
the
foreign
affairs
power.
the
claims
are
more
than
mere
bargaining
chips
in
the
sense
that
one
might...
the
suggestion
was,
send
somebody
over
to
a
foreign
state
in
exchange
for
some
other
benefit
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
might
obtain
from
the
foreign
state.
rather,
the
claims
themselves
create
an
impediment,
a
barrier,
to
normal
foreign
relations.
potentially
they
do,
historically
they
have,
and
in
this
instance
they
have.
you
have
in
effect
a
confrontation
between
citizens
of
this
country
and
a
foreign
state.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
absolutely.
however--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that
would
raise
substantial
constitutional
questions.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
the
president...
that
president
may
have
signed
the
bill
but
the
question
is
whether
constitutionally
that
congress
and
that
president
can
limit
the
power
of
the
presidency
as
an
institution.
fortunately,
that
is
a
question,
that
kind
of
constitutional
confrontation
is
not
before
this
court.
what
you
have
is
a
pattern,
an
historical
pattern,
of
congressional
acquiescence
in
approval
of
and
facilitation
of
the
president's
foreign
claims
settlement
power.
and
this
pattern
continued
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
afterward.
the
very
congress
which
considered
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
enacted
it
in
1976
considered
amendments
to
something
called
the
case
act,
which
required
the
executive
to
make
reports
to
congress
whenever
he
entered
into
executive
agreements.
several
congressmen
introduced
amendments
to
the
case
act
which
would
have
given
congress
the
right
to
override
executive
agreements
by
concurrent
resolution
or
otherwise.
the
executive
branch...
the
state
department,
the
justice
department...
at
the
same
time
they
were
asking
the
congress
to
pass
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
which
after
all
the
executive
branch
drafted,
at
the
very
same
time
they
appeared
before
the
committees
in
congress
and
said,
don't
pass
this
act
limiting
the
executive
agreement
power.
they
canvassed
the
historical
exercise
of
it,
they
focused
particularly
on
the
claims
settlement
power,
on
this
court's
opinions
in
belmont
and
pink,
and
they
argued
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
congress
to
limit
the
executive
power
in
this
way,
particularly
with
respect
to
claims
settlement
agreements.
they
focused
on
that
in
their
arguments
to
congress.
congress,
of
course,
did
not
enact
the
act,
the
very
same
congress
which
did
enact
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
without
a
word
that
it
was
doing
anything
to
undermine
the
historical
claims
settlement
power.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act?
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
did
not
deal
with
the
claims
settlement
power.
that's
my
point.
one
year
later
congress
did
not
think
that
it
had
done
anything
to
undermine
the
claims
settlement
act
when
it
enacted
the
international
economic
powers
act,
because
that
congress,
while
it
limited
some
of
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
powers
in
times
of
peacetime
national
emergency,
it
specifically
said
these
limitations
do
not
affect
the
president's
power
to
settle
the
claims
of
united
states
nationals
against
foreign
states.
now,
if
the
congress
had
thought
that
it
had
taken
that
power
away
a
year
earlier
when
it
enacted
the
sovereign
immunities
act,
it
wouldn't
have
bothered
to
say
that
when
we're
enacting
the
emergency
economic
powers
act,
we're
not
taking
that
power
away.
there's
another
point
about
the
emergency
economic
powers
act
that
is
worth
emphasis.
pursuant
to
that
act
the
president
must
make
reports
to
the
congress
when
he
invokes
his
ieepa
powers.
he
must
say
what
he
has
done
and
why
he's
done
it.
and
the
congress
may
then
consider
whether
he
has
acted
improperly
and
by
concurrent
resolution,
not
a
statute,
it
can
override
the
president's
actions.
and
that
was
done
precisely
here.
the
president,
both
presidents,
made
reports
to
the
congress
as
to
what
they
did.
the
congress
held
hearings,
three
different
committee
hearings;
they
are
mentioned
in
our
brief.
the
senate
committee
issued
a
report;
there
was
no
resolution.
some
of
the
claimants
came
in
and
asked
the
congress
to
exercise
its
powers
to
block
the
implementation
of
the
algerian
declarations.
if
the
congress
didn't
think
there
was
a
problem,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
senate
report
indicated
a
continuing
recognition
of
the
executive
power
to
settle
claims
and
a
feeling
among
the
committee
that
this
power
was
necessary
if
the
united
states
executive
was
to
deal
with
an
equal
with
foreign
states.
so
that
what
you
have
here
are
both
political
branches
of
the
united
states
government
recognizing
this
power.
congress
has
set
the
terms
for
its
review
of
executive
implementation
of
the
ieepa
powers.
and
it
has
found
that
there
hasn't
been
a
problem
there.
i
think
under
those
circumstances
it
becomes
a
political
question,
it's
a
question
committed
to
the
political
branches.
congress
is
not
disenabled
from
acting
here.
it
can
exercise
its
power
if
it
feels
that
there
has
been
a
violation
and
if
it
doesn't
feel
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
oh,
absolutely.
what
i
meant
before
is
that
even
in
the
absence
of
any
kind
of
congressional
facilitation,
approval,
acquiescence,
the
president
would
have
the
power.
but
here
you
have
an
historical
pattern
going
back
to
the
earliest
days
of
the
republic,
of
both
political
branches
acting
together,
recognizing
the
power,
approving
the
power,
congress
enacting
statutes
to
facilitate
the
president's
exercise
of
the
power,
congressional
hearings
in
which
congress
continually...
it
echoes
throughout
the
entire
history
of
the
country,
congressmen
recognizing
the
executive
power,
stating,
of
course
the
executive...
this
is
all
detailed
in
the
appendix
b
to
our
brief.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
in
a
sense,
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
the
question
of
compensation.
if
there
is
going
to
be
compensation
for
a
taking,
of
course,
congress
has
to
provide
the
funds
and
it
has
to
provide
the
mechanism
for
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
taking
and
how
much.
so
in
that
sense
it's
a
political
question.
but
here...
and
this
is
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
raise...
here
there
has
been
a
remedy
created;
there
is
the
tucker
act.
i
agree
with
the
government,
it
took
a
while
for
them
to
come
around
to
our
point
of
view,
but
finally
they
have,
that
the
tucker
act
is
no
bar,
i
mean
that
section
1502
is
no
bar
to
a
tucker
act...
i
believe
your
question
before
as
to
whether,
isn't
that
a
complete
answer?
,
is
yes,
absolutely,
it's
a
complete
answer.
the
tucker
act
provides
a
remedy
at
law.
a
remedy
at
law
if
available
precludes
equitable
relief.
that's
one
of
the
oldest
principles
of
law
there
is.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
oh,
i'm
not
saying
there
was
a
taking.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
then,
i'll
correct
myself.
i
am
not
saying
there
was
a
taking.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
with
respect
to
the
attachments,
our
position
is
the
same
as
the
government's.
there
was
no
taking.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
right.
but
if
there
was
a
taking--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that's
correct.
my
point
is--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--i
don't
think
the
question
is
before
this
court.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
court
addresses
the
taking
issue,
it
should
hold
that
there
is
a
tucker
act
remedy.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
yeah.
and
that
that
is
a
complete
answer.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
i
agree
with
the
position
of
the
government,
the
attachment
issue
is--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--there
is
no
taking
by
the
attachment
issue
because,
for
the
very
reason
stated
by
the
government,
the
attachment
of
the
petitioner
came
secondarily
to
the
government's
assertion
of
a
paramount
federal
interest
over
these
assets.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
yes,
and
clearly
there
has
not
been
a
taking
at
this
time.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
i
think
this
means
my
time
is
up.
