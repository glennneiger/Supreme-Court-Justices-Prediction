justice
stevens
mr.
howard,
before
you
leave
the
forum
selection
clause,
has
the
district
court
in
this
case
decided
the
effect
of
that
clause
on
federal
jurisdiction
yet?
justice
stevens
was
that
perfectly
clear,
or
does
iran
possibly
take
the
position
that
the
clause
means
what
it
says?
justice
stevens
but
has
the
district
court
passed
on
that
contention
of
iran?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not
sure
i
made
my
question
clear.
putting
to
one
side
for
a
moment
the
tribunal--
justice
stevens
--they
might
argue
that
instead
of...
say
there
was
no
tribunal,
would
they
agree
that
they'd
have
to
litigate
in
a
united
states
court
as
opposed
to
an
iranian
court?
justice
stevens
and
the
federal
district
court
has
not
decided
one
way
or
the
other
on
it?
justice
stevens
or
as
pointed
in
actual
treaties
here,
you're
not
questioning
the
constitutionality
or
the
validity
of
the
treaties,
are
you?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
what
about,
why
do
we
worry
about
all
these
hypothetical
cases?
this
is
not
an
overbreadth
case.
i
mean,
supposing
it
does
authorize
some
things
that
couldn't
be
upheld,
couldn't
uphold?
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
stevens
well,
we
know
that
it
authorized
this
freeze
and
you
don't
contest
the
validity
of
this
freeze.
justice
stevens
and
therefore
you
don't
contest
the
validity
of
applying
this
statute
to
this
bundle
of
assets.
justice
stevens
mr.
howard,
let
me
test
your
suggestion
that
there's
no
power
to
send
the
assets
out
of
the
country.
what
if
at
the
time
of
the
initial
freeze
order
the
president
had
also
promulgated
another
regulation
saying
that
on
january
19
of
next
year
i
propose
to
do
the
following
with
the
assets,
which
in
fact
he
later
did.
and
that
in
the
meantime
attachments
may
take
place
but
they
will
only
be
effective
in
the
event
that
my
program
falls
through.
but
if
it
does
go
through
then
the
assets
will,
pursuant
to
the
freeze
order,
be
taken
out
of
the
country.
would
you
say
that
would
have
been
invalid?
justice
stevens
what
if
he
froze
and
said,
next
week
i'm
going
to
ship
all
of
these
assets
out
of
the
country?
could
he
have
done
that?
justice
stevens
what
if
he'd
frozen
on
whatever
the
date
of
the
freeze
was
and
said,
ten
days
from
now
all
of
these
assets
are
going
to
be
shipped
over
to
the
bank
of
england?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
all
he
can
do
under
your
view
is
maintain
the
status
quo?
justice
stevens
well,
say,
as
a
matter
of
administration
i'm
going
to
send
it
over
to
the
bank
of
england
so
it
will
be
free
from
attachments?
and
your
view
is
he
can't
do
that,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
well,
reaching
the
vesting
question--
justice
stevens
that
goes
to
whether
it
was
a
good
deal
or
not,
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
the
president
had
the
power
to
make
the
deal.
justice
stevens
i'm
puzzled
by
perhaps
the
same
question
that
justice
powell
has
asked.
but
i
understand
under
the
executive
order
they're
suspended,
which
means
that
if
the
tribunal
says,
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
they
could
be
refiled
in
a
federal
court.
would
that
not
violate
the
treaty,
the
algerian
declaration?
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
a
position
on
that
yet?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
on
that
point?
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
claims
now
pending
in
american
courts,
which
will
not
be
received
by
the
tribunal?
justice
stevens
the
united
states.
the
suspension
of
those
claims
in
compliance
with
its
obligation
under
the
treaty?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not...
i
didn't
say
that
it
would
require,
is
that
satisfaction
of
the
american
obligation
under
the
treaties,
to
have
the
claims
suspended,
merely
suspended
subject
to
reinstatement
if
the
arbitration
tribunal
refuses
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
talking
about
cases
in
which
the
tribunal
declines
jurisdiction.
and
as
i
understand
your
position,
they
should
decline
jurisdiction
of
some
of
these
claims.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
stevens
and
does
it
satisfy
the
united
states'
obligation
under
the
treaty,
merely
to
suspend
those
claims
pending
the
decision
of
whether
the
tribunal
takes
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
you'd
have
no
case
if
he
had
done
that?
justice
stevens
well,
wait
a
minute.
are
you
suggesting
the
only
possible
purpose
of
a
freeze
order
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
to
protect
american
creditors?
justice
stevens
there
are
many
other
purposes.
justice
stevens
and
support
the
war
effort
in
various
different
ways,
too.
justice
stevens
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
american
creditors,
and
that
could
be
true
of
freezes
as
well
as
vesting
orders.
justice
stevens
no,
but
you're
arguing
with
schooner
peggy
now,
saying
that's
not
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
justice
stevens
that's
right,
if
you
lose.
but
the
only
reason
you
lose
is
we've
decided
you
should
lose;
you
can't
have
this
prize
money--
--the
president
so
far
hasn't
quite
decided
that
my
client
should
lose.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
so
different
from
saying,
you
can't
have
this
attachment.
justice
stevens
--well,
they
say
it's
converted
into
a
claim,
which
is
what
was
in
the
schooner
peggy
case
too.
they're
saying
it's
really
no
more
than
a
claim
because
the
appellate
process
hasn't
run
its
course
yet.
