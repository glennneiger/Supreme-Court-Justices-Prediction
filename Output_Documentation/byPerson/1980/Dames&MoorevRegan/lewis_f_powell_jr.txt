justice
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
there
has
been
no
termination
provided
for
in
this
agreement?
no
termination
of
the
claims?
justice
jr.
your
opening
brief
says
there
has
been
a
termination.
your
opening
brief
also
says
the
agreement
provides
for
a
termination.
look
on
page
7.
justice
jr.
it's
the
first
full
paragraph.
"the
agreement
states
that
"the
purpose
of
both
parties"
is
"to
terminate
all
litigation".
"
and
it
goes
on--
justice
jr.
--yes,
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
but
you're
saying
that
that
purpose
is
not
accomplished?
justice
jr.
if
you
settle
a
claim,
mr.
solicitor
general,
don't
you
terminate
it?
justice
jr.
really?
justice
jr.
that
was
not
my
experience
in
practicing
law.
