what
was
the
basis
of
the
federal
district
court
jurisdiction,
mr.
howard?
justice
stewart
so
that
it
is
not
based
upon
diversity
of
citizenship?
justice
stewart
--and
who
picks
the
neutral
members,
the
so-called
neutral
members?
justice
stewart
by
the
other
members
of
the
court?
justice
stewart
three
united
states
arbitrators?
justice
stewart
if
it
does
cover
the
claims...
would
you
still
agree
that
it
was
a
constitutional
statute?
justice
stewart
in
other
words,
is
this
a
case
of
only
statutory
construction?
justice
stewart
even
if
expressly
authorized
to
do
so
by
congress,
both
houses
of
congress?
justice
stewart
i
thought
you
conceded
a
moment
ago
that
if
the
statute
clearly
authorized
the
president
to
do
what
he
did
in
this
case--
justice
stewart
--then
you
wouldn't
question
the
constitutional
power
of
the
congress
to
authorize
the
president
to
do
so,
but
would
say
that
the
only
constitutional
question
then
remaining
would
be
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
stewart
i
thought
you
had,
with
the
sole
exception
of
your
right
to
just
compensation
for
it.
justice
stewart
have
authorized
precisely
that.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
2,500
claims?
justice
stewart
well,
those
traditional
forces
didn't
seem
to
prevail
in
the
seizure
of
the
hostages
themselves,
did
they?
justice
stewart
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
justice
stewart
we're
not
dealing
here
with
an
assumption.
we're
dealing
with
an
historical
fact.
justice
stewart
yes?
justice
stewart
well,
but
so
far
in
your
argument,
you're
just
telling
us
what
a
good
deal
it
was.
justice
stewart
thus
far
your
entire
argument
has
just
been
directed
to
what
a
favorable,
how
much
all
these
claimants
have
been
helped.
justice
stewart
i
know.
justice
stewart
by
judge
mikva,
who
explicitly
disagreed.
justice
stewart
and
is
this
hostage
act,
is
that
what
it's
always
been
called?
justice
stewart
that's
an
extraordinary
power.
it
gives
him,
according
to
your
submission,
it
gives
him
anything
short
of
the
war
power.
in
other
words,
last
fall,
the
president
could
have
made
a
deal
and
put
you
as
a
hostage
and
exchanged
you
for
one
of
the
hostages
and
brought
him
home,
according
to
your
argument,
you
or
me.
not
justice
marshall,
perhaps.
justice
stewart
one
is,
did
the
president
have
power
to
do
this?
and
secondly,
if
as
you
say
he
did,
then
all
he
did
was
change,
all
that
happened
was,
not
the
ousting
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
but
a
change
in
the
substantive
law.
justice
stewart
they're
two
separate
issues.
justice
stewart
the
claim
is
that
there
has
been
a
taking
right
now,
and
that
the
taking
question
is
not
premature,
so
it
is
at
least...
something
that
is
before
us.
justice
stewart
of
course
you
do.
i
know--
justice
stewart
--but
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
is
whether
there's
been
a
taking
like--
justice
stewart
--well,
that's
your
submission;
yes.
i
understand
that.
justice
stewart
well,
the
rule
of
law
is
you
lose
in
this
case.
