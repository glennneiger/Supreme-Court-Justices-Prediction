mr.
c.
stephen
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i've
asked
the
marshal
to
divide
my
time
to
40
minutes
opening
and
20
minutes
rebuttal.
we
are
here
to
review
two
orders
of
a
federal
district
court
denying
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
in
granting
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
we
are
here
on
an
uncontested
factual
record.
the
government
did
not
put
in
any
factual
opposition
or
evidence
and
by
its
motion
under
rule
12(b)(6)
conceded
the
facts
as
pled.
the
suit
below
relates
to
an
earlier
lawsuit
that
was
filed
by
the
petitioner,
dames
&
moore,
against
the
state
of
iran,
an
agency
of
the
government
called
the
atomic
energy
organization
of
iran
and
several
iranian
banks
that
i
will
refer
to
as
the
bank
defendants.
in
that
lawsuit
the
facts
of
which
are
pled
in
the
complaint
below,
the
petitioner
obtained
attachment
orders
from
the
united
states
district
court.
those
attachment
orders
were
served
on
third
parties
and
property
of
various
of
the
bank
defendants
was
thereby
attached
as
security
for
any--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--the
federal
district
court
jurisdiction
was
premised
on
28
usc
section
1330,
and
the
provisions
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
in
particular
section
1605,
the
section
that
deals
with
whether
or
not
certain
states
are
immune
from
suit
and
sets
out
the
grounds
therein.
section
1330
provides
that
if
a
state
is
not
immune
from
suit
and
is
otherwise
served
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
those
sections,
that
personal
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction
are
automatically
conveyed
upon
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
it
was
not.
the
diversity
section
was
alleged
in
the
jurisdictional
allegation
in
that
complaint
and,
frankly,
it's
a
mistake.
but
the
appropriate
section
was
also
alleged
and
that
is
the
only
section
on
which
we
claimed
jurisdiction
in
that
lawsuit.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
there
were
some
negotiations
between
the
parties
prior
to
that
event
and
those
negotiations
were
not
successful.
they
occurred
in
about
september
and
october,
if
i
recall
correctly.
the
hostages
were
seized
in
early
november
and
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
mid-december.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
it
was
after
the
blocking
order;
yes.
in
that
lawsuit,
in
february
of
1981,
after
extensive
litigation
below
the
petitioner
obtained
a
separate
judgment
against
two
of
the
defendants,
the
state
of
iran,
and
the
atomic
energy
organization,
and
separate
judgment
was
entered
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
54(b).
the
lawsuit
went
on
with
respect
to
the
bank
defendants.
the
petitioner
commenced
efforts
to
levy
on
its
judgment
on
certain
iranian
property
in
the
state
of
washington.
and
the
case
stood
in
that
posture
when
petitioner
filed
the
lawsuit
that
is
now
before
the
court.
that
lawsuit
was
filed
in
reaction
to
the
algerian
declarations,
which
the
court
would
be
familiar
with,
and
the
executive
orders
that
were
promulgated
to
enforce,
carry
out
those
declarations.
in
the
declarations,
which
were
entered
into
on
january
19,
1981,
the
president
agreed...
and
i
would
stress,
the
president,
with
no
participation
by
the
congress...
we're
not
talking
about
a
treaty,
we're
not
talking
about
an
act
of
congress.
the
president
agreed
to
terminate
all
litigation
in
the
united
states
pending
against
iran.
he
agreed
to
nullify
all
judgments
and
all
attachments
against
the
iranians.
he
agreed
to
set
up
an
international
tribunal
which
would,
if
the
agreement
was
carried
out,
have
some
security
for
judgments
that
it
might
render.
it
would
have
a
billion
dollars.
beyond
that,
and
whether
that
tribunal
will
in
fact
be
set
up
and
operate
and
how
long
it
will
take
and
how
certain
its
results
will
be,
none
of
us
know.
the
tribunal
has
an
exclusion
for
its
jurisdiction,
for
claims
with
certain
forum
selection
clauses
favoring
iran,
and
i
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
the
text
of
that
exclusionary
clause
and
also
the
text
of
the
forum
selection
clause
that
appears
in
the
contract
of
petitioner.
it
is
our
position
that
petitioner's
chances
of
proceeding
in
that
tribunal
are
problematic.
i
don't
think
either
the
government
or
petitioner
can
establish
with
absolute
certainty
how
that
tribunal
would
rule,
but
i
think
that
we
can
bring
to
bear
our
own
analysis
on
those
two
provisions
and
conclude
at
a
minimum
that
things
do
not
look
entirely
bright
for
the
petitioner
in
that
tribunal.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
in
its
way,
in
its
brief,
it's
very
careful,
i
notice,
on
this.
it
says
that
the
clauses
may
not
be
binding;
the
word
in
the
government's
brief
is,
may
not
be
binding,
because
of
changed
circumstances,
and
that
the
government
is
urging
the
individual
companies
to
take
the
position
those
are
not
binding
clauses.
now,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
the
tribunal
will
agree
with
that,
and
i
must
say,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
to
me,
reading
the
text,
whether
the
text
of
the
algerian
declarations
even
makes
that
argument
availing,
because
it
talks
about
binding
contracts
with
clauses
providing
such
and
such.
it
doesn't
say,
"contracts
with
binding
clauses",
and
i
can't
tell
even
whether
the
word
"binding"
modifies
the
word
"contract"
or
modifies
the
word
"clause".
so,
in
any
event,
this
is
a
tribunal
that
is
going
to
be
one-third
iranian,
one-third
u.s.,
and
one-third
presumably
some
kind
of
neutral
representatives,
assuming
the
tribunal
operates
at
all.
and
we
simply
have
no
way
of
predicting
whether
or
not
we'll
be
able
to
have
our
claim
in
that
court.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
as
i
understand
it,
they
have
to
be
mutually
selected.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
by
the
two
adversary--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--the
government's
brief
advises
us...
none
of
this
is
in
the
record,
but
the
government's
brief
states
that
three
arbitrators
have
been
picked.
i
have
no
independent
knowledge
of
that
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
and
three
neutrals,
according
to
the
government's
brief.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
again
according
to
the
government's
brief,
the
iranians
have
named
their
three,
the
united
states
have
named
their
three,
and
the
other
three
have
been
selected
although
nothing
has
happened
yet.
they
are
going
to...
according
to
the
government's
brief,
again...
have
a
meeting
shortly
for
organizational
purposes.
in
the
meantime
we're
almost
six
months
from
the
agreement
and
the
so-called
settlements
that
were
supposed
to
take
place
before
the
tribunal
have
not
taken
place
at
all,
to
my
knowledge.
now,
as
i
indicated,
it's
very
unclear
whether
petitioner
can
go
to
this
tribunal
or
not.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no,
i
don't
think
that's
a
question
that...
first
of
all,
the
court
couldn't
dispositively
resolve
that
in
any
event.
as
i
understand
it,
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
tribunal
to
resolve
its
own
jurisdiction.
i
simply
present
the
petitioner's
case
to
you
as
one
in
which
it
is
hardly
clear
that
we
have
any
alternative
remedy,
although
it
is
also
my
position
that
even
if
we
have
clear
access
to
that
tribunal
that
the
president
is
without
power,
acting
alone,
to
take
us
out
of
the
united
states
district
court
where
the
congress
put
us
and
make
us
go
there.
now,
the
executive
orders--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--no.
the
united
states
in
its
initial
suggestions
of
interest
that
were
filed
in
these
cases
in
february
stated
that
the
courts
should
require
the
iranians
to
take
a
position
in
the
individual
case
as
to
whether
or
not
it
belonged
in
the
tribunal
or
in
the
district
court.
and
if,
for
example,
iran
agreed
that
you
couldn't
go
there,
then
the
case
could
proceed,
according
to
this
early
statement
of
interest.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
am
confident
iran
takes
the
position
that
the
clause
means
what
it
says.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no.
the
iranians
in
our
case
and
to
my
knowledge
in
all
cases
have
steadfastly
refused
to
accept
the
invitation
that
they
take
a
position.
i
believe...
you
can
ask
mr.
shack,
but
i
believe
their
position
is
that
they
have
no
requirement
to
take
a
position
in
district
court.
there
are
the
accords,
the
president
has
purported
to
suspend
all
claims
that
may
possibly
go
to
the
tribunal,
and
that's
the
end
of
it,
for
the
district
court.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
right.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
oh,
no.
i'm
sure
that
the
iranians
would
take
the
position
that
the
forum
selection
clause
in
our
contract
is
enforceable.
we
take
the
position
that
because
of
changed
circumstances
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--did
not
decide
that
question,
although
that
particular
question
was
not
contested
in
the
hearing
that
took
place
on
our
judgment.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
in
iran.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that
is
correct.
and
the
united
states
takes
the
position,
as
i
understand,
that
because
there
is
a
prelitigation
step,
admittedly,
in
iran
and
with
the
third
arbitrator
chosen
by
the
iranian
government,
that
therefore
we
are
not
committed
to
the
sole
jurisdiction
of
iranian
courts.
now,
that's
an
imaginative
interpretation
and
i
suppose
if
my
client
loses
this
case
i
may
be
someday
trying
to
make
that
argument
myself,
but
i'm
not
entirely
confident
that
i'm
going
to
succeed.
the
executive
has
now
implemented
these
accords
by
in
fact
promulgating
a
series
of
executive
orders,
and
those
executive
orders
purport
to
nullify
all
attachments
and
to
order
the
property
that
is
secured
by
those
attachments...
and
property
that's
not
secured
by
attachments...
back
to
iran
under
the
pain
of
criminal
penalties.
the
executive
has
not
simply
unfrozen
the
property,
to
let
it
be
in
the
marketplace
and
to
be
moved
by
the
iranians
or
attached,
as
the
litigation
process
may
determine,
but
rather
the
executive
has
ordered
the
property
out
of
the
country
and
has
set
criminal
penalties
for
anyone
who
does
not
cooperate
with
that.
in
a
later
executive
order
the
executive
has
suspended...
that's
the
word
of
the
order...
all
claims
in
the
united
states
now
against
iran,
and
indicated
that...
unless
it's
absolutely
clear
that
they
can't
go
to
the
tribunal
and
given
the
united
states's
interpretation,
no
claim
is
absolutely,
is
it
absolutely
clear
it
can't
go
to
the
tribunal.
so
that,
in
effect,
all
claims
against
the
iranians
have
been
suspended.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
in
logic
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
because
one
of
the
issues
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
executive
has
the
unfettered
discretion
to
settle
in
his
own
whim,
or
for
good
reason,
as
he
sees
it,
the
claims
of
americans
against
foreign
states.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
executive
has
that
power...
and
obviously
i
want
to
address
that...
if
the
executive
has
that
power
to
settle
a
claim,
i
suppose
he
can
also
give
away
the
security.
so,
in
that
sense,
the
order
by
president
reagan
might
be
regarded
as
going
further.
i
think
it
goes...
it
certainly
goes
further
in
terms
of
infringements
on
court
processes,
although
you
get
there
only,
i
think,
by
an
analytic
process.
all
that
it
purports
to
do
by
itself
is
suspend
the
filing.
now,
the
effect
of
these
orders
together
on
the
petitioner
and
its
case
is
frankly
devastating.
we
had
a
judgment
against
two
parties
we
were
in
the
process
of
trying
to
levy,
we
had
a
lawsuit
going
on
against
the
rest
of
the
parties
with
attachments;
it's
all
wiped
out.
our
judgment
is
nullified,
our
judgment
levies
are
nullified,
our
attachments
are
nullified,
we
can't
even
keep
suing
the
parties
who
were
still
before
the
district
court,
and
our
only
alternative
is
to
go
to
the
hague
with
the
time
and
expense
that's
involved
there
and
quite
possibly
be
told
that
we're
not
entitled
to
present
our
claim
there,
and
even
if
we
are
they
only
have
a
small
fraction
of
the
money
that's
necessary
to
pay
off
the
claims.
for
that
reason,
we
filed
an
action
below
seeking
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
and
as
indicated
in
the
briefs
the
government
filed
a
cross-motion
under
12(b)(6)
to
dismiss,
our
motion
was
denied,
and
the
government's
motion
was
granted,
and
the
district
court
has
indicated
in
its
memorandum
that
he
did
reach
the
merits,
if
you
will,
of
these
constitutional
issues
presented,
because
he
indicated
that
he
ruled
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
government.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
you
mean
on
the
forum
selection
clause?
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
we
presented
that
argument
to
the
district
court.
it
is
hard
for
me
to
know
what-all
thoughts
went
through
his
mind;
we
certainly
argued
the
taking
in
our
memorandum.
the
government
only
fleetingly
addressed
it,
as
i
recall,
in
its
papers.
the
argument
certainly
has
been
rejected
by
the
district
court.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
well,
we
didn't
actually
go
secure
them
in
the
sense
of
making
an
application.
the
executive,
i
think
through
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
promulgated
a
series
of
regulations
in
which
he
said,
judicial
proceedings
are
authorized.
and
then
a
subsequent
regulation
says,
the
authorization
for
judicial
proceedings
includes
attachments.
and
so
we
did
proceed
to
attach
with
those
regulations
in
effect,
although
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
case
of
zittman
v.
mcgrath
the
executive
do
not
have
the
power
to
prevent
those
attachments,
so
why--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--that's
right.
so
long
as
they
didn't
interfere
with
his
freezing
program.
so
long
as
they
didn't
interfere
with
his
freezing
program
we
could
get
them
anyway.
now--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--no,
i
think
orvis
deals
with
a
different
question.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
well,
they
both
deal
with
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
in
situations
in
which
the
alien
property
custodian
exercised
his
power
to
vest,
a
power
the
president
does
not
have--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--under
the
international
emergency
powers
act.
in
both
cases,
the
alien
property
custodian
vested
the
property.
in
one
case
he
purported
to
vest
only
whatever
the
enemy
had
and
the
other,
in
the
orvis
case
he
vested...
it's
called
a
res
vesting;
he
took
it.
and
the
court
in
orvis...
first
in
zittman,
they
said,
the
attachment
is
good
as
between
debtor
and
creditor,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
freeze
program
that
the
president
is
trying
to
carry
out.
but
in
orvis
he
did
a
res
vesting
and
the
court
said,
when
the
alien
property
custodian
takes
the
property,
when
he
seizes
it
and
vests
it
under
a
power
he
doesn't
have
now,
he
takes
free
of
the
attachment.
and
so
the
creditor
in
orvis
was
not
secured,
not
able
to
get
his
property
back
under
section
9
of
that
act,
but
became
an
unsecured
creditor
under
section
34
of
that
act,
none
of
which
protections
do
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
at
least
understand,
mr.
justice
white,
where
you
want
me
to
address
my
argument.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
never
before
in
american
history
has
a
president,
acting
alone
without
congress,
without
two-thirds
of
the
senate,
attempted
to
do
what
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
case.
never
has
a
president
acting
alone
taken
claims
pending
before
united
states
district
courts,
validly
and
enforceably
there
under
congressional
statute,
and
taken
them
out
of
those
courts
and
put
them
in
an
international
tribunal.
never.
never
before
has
a
president
acting
alone
or
acting
under
any
statutory
authority
that
now
exists,
or
acting
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
even
in
its
older
form,
never
has
a
president
acting
alone
attempted
to
transfer
out
of
the
country
valuable
assets
of
a
foreign
country
that
serve
as
potential
security
for
the
claims
of
american
citizens,
leaving
them
unpaid
and
without
any
practical
remedy.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
agree
with
you
completely.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
just
historically.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
he's
never
done
it.
never
happened.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
with
the
aid
of
a
treaty
at
least
we
have
similar
cases
to
the
present
case.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
certainly.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
exactly.
that
is
a
treaty
case.
and
then,
let
me
quite
clear
about
this.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
political
departments
of
the
government
acting
together
could
not
do
everything
that
has
been
done.
they
could,
although
they
would
have
to
pay
for
the
taking.
but
they
could
do
everything
that's
been
done.
the
question
is
whether
the
president
can
do
it,
acting
alone,
without
two-thirds
of
the
senate,
without
the
majority
of
both
houses
of
congress.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
yes.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
emergency
powers
act
is
unconstitutional.
we
do
contend
that
it
doesn't
cover
this
case.
and
even
if
it
does,
it
doesn't
cover
everything
that
was
done.
that
goes
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
the
order
suspending
the
claims
is
not
justified
by
that
act.
i
don't
think
anyone
seriously
contests
that.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
if,
to
the
extent
that
the
emergency
powers
act--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--only
as
to
the
transfer
of
the
assets,
mr.
justice,
only
as
to
the
transfer
of
the
assets.
it
remains
a
very
thorny
constitutional
question,
whether
the
president
can
dip
into
the
courts
and
pull
cases
out.
because--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--no...
well,
i
don't
think
the
government
seriously
contends
that
the
international
emergency
powers
act
authorized
the
president
to
take
those
cases
out
of
court.
they
do
contend,
quite
seriously,
that
it
authorized
them
to
send
the
property
back.
but
hypothetically--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--yes?
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
a
taking.
i
think
that's
correct.
if
the
statute
in
fact
authorized
everything
here--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--i
am,
yes;
if
that
statute
were
to
be
construed
to
authorize
everything,
although
none
of
the
courts
below
have
adopted
that
argument.
what
they
have
said
is
that
it
authorized
him
to
send
the
assets
back.
that's
all
they
have
found
that
the
international
powers
act
authorizes.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
yes,
judge
breyer
did.
i'm
sorry.
when
i
said
the
courts,
i
was
referring
to
majorities.
that
is
correct.
now,
perhaps
i
should
turn,
in
fact,
to
the
international
emergency
powers
act,
because
that
seems
to
be
the
first
question,
in
a
sense.
this
statute
is
a
very
old
statute,
it's
been
before
the
court
many
times
in
prior
forms.
the
language
of
the
statute
is
hodgepodge.
the
syntactic
structure,
you
have
seven
verbs
in
the
disjunctive,
followed
by
fourteen
nouns
in
the
disjunctive.
that's
98
combinations
of
things
the
president
can
do.
and
wait,
let's
see
what
he
can
do
them
to:
any
property
in
which
either
the
foreign
country
or
any
citizen
has
any
interest...
not
a
fee
interest;
any
interest,
and
not
only
is
it
the
foreign
country
or
the
citizen,
it's
any
foreign
country;
not
just
the
foreign
country
that
happens
to
have
provoked
the
emergency.
this
statute,
if
literally
read,
says
that
if
i
bought
a
house
and
needed
a
swing
loan
for
my
down
payment
and
i
had
a
neighbor
who
was
a
canadian
citizen
and
lent
me
some
money
and
i
put
a
third
trust
deed
on
my
house,
and
we
had
an
emergency
with
the
iranians,
the
president
could
make
me
deed
the
house
to
the
ayatollah.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no.
well,
maybe
i
went
too
far.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
if
the...
it
is
our
position
that
the
congress
could
in
fact
by
statute--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--have
authorized
that.
sure,
that
would
be
a
taking
for
public
use,
for
which
i
would
then
seek
compensation.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
correct.
but
our
position
is
that
it
can't
be
read
literally.
that
just
simply
doesn't
make
any
sense,
that
if
you
look--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--absolutely
not.
absolutely
not.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
the
hypothetical
is
offered
only
to
show
that
in
trying
to
figure
out
what
dimensions
to
give
to
the
statute,
you
can't
just
go
by
the
words.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
correct.
but
the
freeze--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
but
this
statute,
our
position
is,
this
statute
authorizes
the
president
to
unfreeze,
to
unfreeze.
he's
entitled
to
freeze,
and
he
can
unfreeze.
but
the
structure
of
the
statute
is
that
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
he
had
two
broad
powers,
and
the
cases
and
the
articles
that
we've
cited,
contemporaneous
with
that
act,
i
think
make
relatively
clear
that
the
bundle
of
words
that
we're
dealing
with
now
was
always
referred
to
as
the
freezing
or
the
blocking
power.
that's
the
freezing
or
the
blocking
power.
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
he
was
also
entitled
to
vest,
he
could
take
the
property
himself
and
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states,
although
if
he
did
that
he
was
obligated
ultimately
to
distribute
to
the
creditors
of
the
country
from
whom
he
took
it.
in
enacting
the
emergency
powers
act
the
congress
took
away
the
power
to
vest.
now,
in
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
if
you
just
look
at
that
statute
by
itself,
it
seems,
to
me
at
least,
inconceivable
that
the
president
could
when
he
vested,
he
was
required
to
hold
the
assets
and
ultimately
distribute
them
to
american
creditors.
it
seems
inconceivable
that
the
freezing
power
would
have
allowed
him
to
simply
send
the
assets
back
to
the
other
country.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
away
from
the
creditors.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no,
i
wouldn't...
i
do
argue
that.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
because
even
if
you
could
immunize
from
attachment,
mr.
justice,
even
if
you
could
immunize--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--i
understand,
but
nevertheless,
he
couldn't
send
the
property
back.
all
he
can
do
is
unfreeze.
he
has
the
power
to
freeze
and
block,
and
when
he
decides
that
it's
appropriate
to--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--that
depends
on
whether
or
not
he,
in
his
regulatory
scheme,
made
that
attachment
revocable
or
not.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
not
if
my
attachment
didn't
interfere
with
his
freeze
power.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
yes,
but
there's
yet
another
question,
mr.
justice,
which
is
in
some
sense
the
most
paramount
one.
can
he
send
the
property
back?
because,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
he
unfreezes,
we
will
all
be
at
the
courthouse
getting
new
attachments.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
if
my
attachment
is
not
worth
anything,
yes.
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
well,
no--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--oh,
as
far
as...
that's
correct.
but
our
position
is
that
even
if
he
can,
even
if
he
could
immunize
it
from
attachment,
the
most
he
can
do
is
freeze
the
property
and
keep
that
immunization
in
effect,
and
some
day
he's
got
to
unfreeze.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
because
it
is
the
same
words
that
are
in
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
that
are
construed
by
the
court
in
zittman,
and
the
court
in
zittman
says
that
if
the
attachment
doesn't
require
a
transfer
of
ownership
or
possession
and
they
distinguish
propper
v.
clark
on
that
basis,
it
doesn't
require
transfer
of
ownership
or
possession,
or
otherwise
interfere
with
the
freezing...
for
example,
i
suppose,
if
completing
the
attachment
required
moving
the
property
in
some
way
that
the
president
felt
took
it
out
of
his
control,
if
the
provisional
remedy
interferes
with
the
freeze,
then,
of
course,
he
can
regulate
or
prohibit
it.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
there
may
have
been...
the
claimant
in
orvis
was
not
licensed.
the
plaintiff
in
orvis
was
not
licensed.
he
had
an
unlicensed
attachment.
had
he
had
a
licensed
attachment,
he
would
have
won
the
case.
but
he
was
unlicensed
and
the
court
held
that
an
unlicensed
attachment
is
an
junior
right
when
the
president
vests;
something
he
can't
do
here;
he
can't
do
here.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
yes,
he
can't...
there's
nothing
that
allows
him
to
send
the
property
out
of
the
country.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
pardon?
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
and
anybody
who
doesn't
do
it
will
go
to
jail?
because
that's
where
it
now
sets.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
he
can't
do
that
under
the
freeze.
that's
not
freezing,
that's
not
freezing,
that's
moving...
that's
vesting
and
taking
the
property
away.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
right.
he
can
administer
the
property.
i
mean,
he
can
do
the
things
you
need
to
do
to
sell
it.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
yes.
that's
a
difficult
question,
i
must
admit;
that's
right
around
the
borderline.
but
i'm
trying
to
talk
about
a
difference
between
freezing
and
controlling
and
blocking
this
property,
and
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
he
could
then
take
step
two
and
take
it,
but
he
can't--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--right.
but
he
can't.
he
can't
do
that,
and
i
admit,
i
freely
admit,
that
there
are
words
in
the
statute
to
compel
a
transfer,
just
as
he
could
compel
me
to
transfer
my
house,
but
never
was
that
done.
and
it
couldn't
have
been
done
because
that
would
obviously
have
frustrated
american
creditors
who
were
to
be
protected
if
he
vested.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
correct.
on
the
issue
of
the
president's
power
alone,
the
government
has
put
in
a
lot
of
historical
information
which
they
say
amounts
to
a
practice,
a
consistent
practice
of
the
executive
to
do
just
what
he
has
done
here.
and
our
position
is
that
these
examples
and
these
precedents,
in
fact,
have
been
totally
stood
on
their
head.
that
is
to
say,
historically,
americans
with
claims
against
foreigners
were
disabled.
they
had
to
deal
with
the
sovereign
immunity
doctrine.
first
it
was
absolute,
then
restricted
but
not
applied
very
consistently.
even
if
they
could
get
around
immunity
they
had
no
way
of
getting
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
states,
so
they
had
to
try
to
work
out
some
quasi-in-rem
jurisdiction
and
if
they
ever
got
as
far
as
a
judgment
they
couldn't
enforce
it,
there
were
no
execution
provisions
in
this
country
for
the
enforcements
of
judgments
against
foreign
states.
so
that,
before
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
there
was
no
practical
way
to
really
sue
a
foreign
state
in
this
country.
and
naturally,
what
happened
is,
individuals
went
to
the
government
and
said,
please
help
us,
we
have
been
hurt,
our
property
has
been
expropriated,
or
they
breached
this
contract,
or
whatever
the
claims
were.
and
the
executive,
in
service
to
the
american
citizens,
has
tried
to
settle
many
of
those
claims
and
to
be
sure,
occasionally
a
citizen
has
been
unhappy
with
the
result
that
the
executive
may
have
obtained.
but
the
history
is
of
using
diplomacy
to
aid
the
private
citizen,
not
to
sacrifice
the
rights
of
the
citizen
to
aid
a
diplomatic
goal.
it's
totally
turned
around
here.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
was
intended
to
put
a
category
of
these
claims
into
the
courts
and
out
of
the
process
of
diplomatic
settlement.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
deals
only
with
immunity,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
settlement.
i
think
that
that
really
rather
misses
the
point.
immunity
is
a
way
of
deciding
which
track
you're
going
to
be
in.
are
you
going
to
litigate?
or
are
you
going
to
try
to
settle
it
diplomatically?
and
immunity
is
the
device
by
which
that
procedural
choice
is
made,
and
this
is
not
something
that
has
escaped
people
in
the
past.
let
me
quote
if
i
may,
please,
from
mr.
justice
stone,
chief
justice
at
the
time,
in
the
very
case
that
is
the
leading
case
on
absolute
sovereign
immunity,
ex
parte
peru,
and
there
the
secretary
made
a
suggestion
of
immunity,
and
the
chief
justice
says,
"when
the
secretary
elects,
as
he
may
and
he
appears
to
have
done
in
this
case.
"
--and
i
might
say,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
his
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity...
"when
he
elects
to
settle
claims
against
the
vessel
by
diplomatic
negotiations
between
the
two
countries
rather
than
by
continued
litigation
in
the
courts,
it
is
of
public
importance
that
the
action
of
the
political
arm
of
the
government
taken
within
its
appropriate
sphere
be
promptly
recognized.
"
now,
the
point
is
that
the
chief
justice
recognizes
that
the
immunity
decision
is
a
choice.
you
assert
it
because
you're
going
to
now
try
the
diplomatic
settlement
rather
than
litigation.
and
similarly,
in
testimony
before
the
house
committee,
in
enacting
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
the
justice
department...
witness:
mr.
ristau...
says,
"a
successful
plea
of
sovereign
immunity
interposed
by
a
state
does
not
terminate
the
claim.
"
"rather,
the
claim
is
merely
transferred
to
the
diplomatic
arena,
which
is
ill-suited
for
the
settlement
of
private
law
or
commercial
disputes.
"
now,
the
congress
has
decided
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
that
certain
classes
of
cases
shall
not
be
transferred
to
the
diplomatic
arena,
that
the
litigants
shall
be
given
the
powers
and
the
rights
that
go
with
litigation
in
this
country,
and
they
have
redefined
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
courts--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--it
does.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
certainly
our
position.
the
government
obliquely
questions
that
in
its
brief,
but
i
take
it
that
that
issue
is
not
here
before
the
court.
it
does
recognize
attachments
in
certain
circumstances
and,
more
importantly,
not
only
does
it
recognize
attachments,
for
the
first
time
in
united
states
history
it
has
execution
provisions.
you
can
do
something
with
a
judgment
if
you
get
it.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
accomplished
four
things.
it
codified
the
restrictive
principle
of
sovereign
immunity;
it
put
the
sovereign
immunity
decision
entirely
in
the
courts,
entirely
in
the
courts.
the
executive
was
to
be
taken
out
of
the
process;
no
more
politics.
the
legislative
history
is
full
of
this
talk,
we
don't
want
to
have
individuals'
claims
being
resolved
by
international
policy
considerations.
the
case,
rich
v.
naviera,
the
cuban
hijacking
and
the
eastern
airlines
hijacking,
was
in
front
of
them
at
that
very
time,
where
the
executive
had
traded
an
immunity
decision
to
get
the
plane
back.
and
they
were
very
unhappy
with
that
decision.
so
they
put
this
in
front
of
the
courts,
and
they
put
in
provisions
for
service
of
process,
which
was
effectively
a
way
of
getting
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
foreign
citizen,
which
you
could
never
do
before,
and
they
put
in
execution
provisions.
so
now
there
were
real
lawsuits--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that
is
theoretically
possible
but
it's
pretty
hard
to
read
the
language
of
the
fsia
that
way.
the
only
argument
that
i
have
heard
which
admittedly
was
accepted
by
one
judge,
although
interestingly
enough
he
said,
i
accept
this
argument
because
i
am
terrified
by
the
executive's
claim
to
this
inherent
settlement
power
which
it
could
use
at
any
time,
not
even
in
an
emergency
or
not,
that
judge
did
find
appealing
the
argument
that
ieepa
prohibits...
i
have
to
pick
out
the
magic
words...
prohibits
a
citizen
from
exercising
a
right
with
respect
to
iranian
property.
and
he
said,
i
think
filing
a
lawsuit
is
such
an
act.
now,
i
guess
i'd
want
to
say
two
things
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
traditional
government
argument
has
been
that
somehow
the
president
could
freeze
the
claim,
the
claim
of
the
united
states
citizen.
that
doesn't
work
out
very
well
because
it's
pretty
hard
to
say
that
the
claim
of
the
u.s.
citizen
against
iran
is
property
in
which
the
iranians
have
an
interest.
so
that
one
doesn't
work.
but
this
other
one,
that
judge
breyer
went
for,
i
think,
is
equally
unavailing
because
a
lawsuit
isn't
the
exercising
of
a
right
with
respect
to
property.
if
you
get
a
judgment
and
you
go
out
and
try
to
get
some
property,
then
you're
exercising
a
right
with
respect
to
property.
but
we
do
not
deny
that
the
executive,
as
long
as
the
emergency
continues,
could
prevent
execution,
he
could
freeze
and
he
could
stop
the
assets
from
being
transferred
to
the
particular
judgment
creditor.
but
it
would
be,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--because
they
don't
interfere
with
his
freeze.
the
execution,
mr.
justice
white,
would
take
the
property
away
from
the
president.
but
if
the
attachment
simply
lies
there
as
a
lien,
not
preventing
the
president
his
use
of
the
property--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--i
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
the
government
does
make
that
argument.
it's
made
in
a
half--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--i
think
it's
pretty
hard.
you've
got
to
stretch
the
words
even
of
that
statute,
to
say
that
he's
authorized
to
stop
the
lawsuit.
the
time
that
i
had
asked
the
marshal
to
hold
me
to
on
the
opening
argument
has
expired.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i'd
like
to
start
immediately
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
there
are
two
points
to
be
made.
first
of
all,
there
are
lots
of
things
that
impair
the
president's
ability
to
negotiate
with
a
hostile
foreign
country.
he
can't
write
a
check
on
the
treasury.
he
can't
send
the
assets
of
my
client
over
directly.
he
can't
even
send
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
are
many
things
that
he
might
want
to
do,
there
are
many
things
that
might
solve
the
problem,
that
might
make
negotiation
easier,
which
are
outside
of
his
power.
but
the
second
answer
is,
if
it
is
important
for
the
president
to
have
this
particular
power,
to
have
this
particular
power
to
regulate
suits
against
the
foreign
hostile
power
party
while
negotiating
with
him,
then
the
place
to
address
that
need
is
the
congress,
not
the
supreme
court.
he
should
go
to
congress
and
say,
i
can't
conduct
foreign
relations
without
this
power
and
the
congress--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--first,
there's
a
systematic
matter.
if
the
executive
believes
he
needs
this
authority
i
think
he
ought
to
go
to
congress
and
get
it,
although
in
the
hearings
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
enactment,
the
executive
said
he
didn't
need
it.
the
executive
specifically
said,
the
pressures
that
we
get
from
foreign
powers
to
settle
these
kinds
of
disputes,
and
particularly
these
commercial
disputes,
are
a
problem
for
us.
please
take
this
away.
this
isn't
a
question
of
conflict
between
congress
and
the
executive.
they
agreed
that
this
kind
of
claim
should
be
in
the
courts
and
not
before
the
executive.
if
the
executive
needs
the
power,
let's
say
in
this
particular
case
he
needs
the
power,
now,
to
deal
with
these
lawsuits.
in
fact,
let
me
tie
this
together
with
mr.
shack's
talking
about
the
agreement
and
whether
it's
enforceable
or
not.
and
what
would
be
the
consequences
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
these
acts
were
outside
the
power
of
the
president?
first
of
all,
the
reagan
administration
has
very
carefully
never
taken
a
position
as
to
whether
this
is
an
enforceable
agreement
under
international
law.
and
quite
frankly,
one
of
the
many
principles
of
international
law
is
that
agreements
entered
into
under
duress
with
a
gun
at
your
head
aren't
enforceable,
just
as
they
aren't
in
many
civilized
countries.
so
that
if
this
agreement
is
struck
down,
they
may
very
well
defend
on
that
ground.
now,
they
may
very
well
make
arguments
like,
damages,
your
man
isn't
entitled
to
all
this
$4
billion
back.
they
would
have
to
prove
that
they
wouldn't
lose
it
again
in
the
tribunal.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
the
united
states.
united
states.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no.
the
united
states
would.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
but
if
the
administration
believes
that
it's
in
its
interest,
in
its
foreign
policy
interest
to
go
through
with
this
agreement,
it
can
do
it.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that,
i
think,
is
a
question
for
neither
the
court
nor
for
me.
that's
a
question
for
the
president
and
the
congress.
if
the
congress
wants
the
administration
to
go
through--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--if
we
are
correct
that
some
of
the
things
that
the
president
agreed
to
do
are
outside
of
his
power
acting
alone,
then
he
needs
the
congress.
he
can
do
one
of
two
things.
he
can
go
across
the
street
and
convince
two-thirds
of
the
senate
to
ratify
a
treaty.
he
can
do
this
if
he
can
get
two-thirds
of
the
senate
to
go
along
with
him.
he
can
do
this
if
he
can
get
a
majority
of
the
congress--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--that's
right,
i
believe
that,
unfortunately,
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
either
one
is
quite
clear.
a
treaty,
properly
enacted
treaty
can
override
a
prior
act
of
congress.
i
think
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
could
be
overridden
by
a
treaty,
but
not
by
an
executive
agreement,
and
in
fact--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
taking
of
it.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
powers.
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
there
is
a
suggestion,
i
think,
that
goes
through
the
questioning,
that
this
problem
all
goes
away
if
it's
a
taking,
and
that
we
can
just
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
unfortunately,
there's
a
big
catch.
there
is
no
remedy
for
an
unauthorized
taking.
if
we
are
right
on
the
power
questions,
then
we
have
no
remedy,
because
no
one
is
liable
for
an
unauthorized
taking.
that
is
the
law
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
even
an
unlicensed
attachment.
the
attachment
in
orvis
was
unlicensed.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
well,
that's
the
government's
best
case.
orvis
is
the
jewel
in
their
crown.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
our
position
is
that--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
and
this
gets
back
to
some
of
the
questions
that
mr.
justice
stevens
was
asking.
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
the
president
was
not
empowered
to
take
away,
to
undercut,
to
remove
the
rights
of
american
citizens.
he
was
entitled
to
undercut
rights
of
foreign
powers.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
it's
the
freezing--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--the
freezing
language
is
the
same.
the
vesting
language
is
not
there.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
would
say
two
things.
number
one,
no
president
ever
did
it.
and
that
ought
to
tell
us
something.
no
president
ever
did
it
or
tried
it.
but
secondly,
wouldn't
it
have
been
crazy
to
have
a
rule
that
said,
if
the
president
takes
the
property,
he
has
to
hold
it
for
the
american
creditors?
he
takes
it
under
his
vesting
power;
he
has
to
hold
it
for
american
creditors.
but
under
the
freeze
he
can
send
it
back
free
and
clear?
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no,
i
say
that
since
he
couldn't
do
it
under
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
because
that
would
have
made
the
statute
crazy.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no,
no.
obviously,
it
was--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--first,
was
to
thwart
the
enemy,
and
to
make
sure
the
enemy
couldn't
get
access
to
its
own
property.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
right.
but
if
the
president--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--although
once
he
vested
he
had
to...
yeah,
there
was
a
whole
claims
procedure
set
up
to
satisfy
even
unsecured
creditors,
people
who
didn't
have
property
at
all
but
who
had
a
claim
against
that
particular
nation.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i'm
sorry.
i
haven't
heard
a
question
i
can
answer.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
couldn't
agree
more
with
the
fundamental
proposition.
there
isn't
any
precedent
here.
you,
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
are
going
to
make
new
law
in
this
case,
that
no
matter
what
you
decide,
you're
going
to
make
new
law.
and
that
is
the
state
of
the
record.
as
far
as
mr.
henkin's
treatise
is
concerned,
the
first
and
foremost
thing
about
it
is
what
you
said,
it
was
written
in
1972.
so
it
was
written
before
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
it
was
written
before
the
executive
and
the
president
agreed
to
take
certain
claims
and
put
them
in
american
courts.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
schooner
peggy
rule
of
law
analogy
is
quite
appropriate,
putting
apart
the
treaty
issue.
in
schooner
peggy
there
was
a
new
rule
of
law,
and
it
was,
the
plaintiff
loses.
that
was
the
new
rule
of
law.
there's
no...
tell
me
what
the
new
rule
of
law
here
is?
the
new
rule
of
law
is,
you
can't
be
in
this
court--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--no,
the
government
won't
concede
that.
the
rule
of
law
is
the
plaintiff
goes
to
another
court.
if
it's
not--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--but
it's
not
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
it's
not
a
substantive
rule
of
law.
it
says,
you
go
someplace
else
and
try.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no,
no.
schooner
peggy
wasn't,
go
to
another
court;
it
is,
you
lose.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
no,
i'm
saying,
the
president
is
saying,
i'm
not
going
to
decide
whether
you
win
or
lose
but
i'm
going
to
make
you
go
to
a
different
court
than
the
one
the
congress
put
you
in.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
believe
that
is
their
position.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
the
government's
position
is
that
our
judgment,
our
final
judgment,
which
surmounted
all
these
alleged
difficulties
that
we've
been
relieved
of,
has
been
annulled.
that's
the
government's
position.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
think
perhaps
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
me
to
engage
in
dialogue
about
whether
it's
a
new
rule
of
law
or
not,
because
it
does
obscure
the
most
important
point.
we
concede
that
by
treaty
the
president
and
two-thirds
of
the
senate
could
say,
we
changed
our
minds,
we
don't
want
these
commercial
cases,
at
least
not
this
bunch
or
these
kinds
or
these
situations,
have
to
watch
out
for
attainder
problems.
but
they
could,
in
fact,
alter
the
rules
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
but
it
wasn't
done.
it
wasn't
done
by
treaty.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
it
would
still
be
a
taking;
you
would
still
have
to
pay
for
it.
but
at
least
it
would
be
authorized.
but
in
the
current
situation
our
position
is
that
if
the
present
administration
wants
to
go
through
with
this,
they've
got
to
get
two-thirds
of
the
senate
or
get
the
majority
of
each
house
of
congress
and
appropriate
the
money.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
if
the
court
were
to
rule
for
the
petitioner,
and
there
are
future
negotiations
going
on
in
which
the
other
power
wants
to
achieve
some
results
in
courts,
i'd
say
the
president
had
better
go
to
the
congress
first
and
get
that
authority.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
rule
our
way,
that
it
would
be
rather
clear,
then,
that
the
president
couldn't
do
that,
and
that's
not
something
that
he
could
bargain
with.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
the
president's
inability
to
compromise
or
give
away
claims
pending
in
court
would
of
course
be...
if
he
couldn't
do
that,
that's
one
less
thing
that
he
can't
do...
it's
one
more
thing
that
he
can't
do.
but
he
also
can't
write
a
check
on
the
treasury.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
pardon?
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
that's
right.
and
many
things
that
a
president
can't
do
in
trying
to
deal
with
a
foreign
power.
he
has
limitations.
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
forbidden,
i
think,
is
too
strong
a
word.
i
think--
mr.
c.
stephen
howard
--the
two,
the
executive
and
the
congress
got
together,
and
they
agreed
that
this
should
be
outside
of
the
executive.
they
should
be
free
of
pressure.
now,
if
the
executive
were,
if
the
arguments
made
by
my
adversaries
were
correct,
the
executive
is
right
back
in
the
box.
every
time
a
suit
called
a
commercial
suit
now
is
filed,
the
foreign
power
who
doesn't
like
it
has
the
same
kind
of
opportunity
that
he
had
before
to
come
to
the
state
department
and
now,
he
doesn't
say,
would
you
suggest
immunity?
it's,
would
you
mind
settling
my
case?
i
think
we'll
able
to
conclude
that
other
matter
much
more
expeditiously.
and
that's
precisely
what
both
branches
of
the
government,
the
president
and
the
congress,
said
they
didn't
want
to
happen.
here
we
had
an
emergency;
no
one
doubts
that.
and
it
happened.
but
it's
in
emergencies
that
lines
get
crossed
that
shouldn't
be
crossed
and
that
this
court
should
draw.
i'll
conclude.
