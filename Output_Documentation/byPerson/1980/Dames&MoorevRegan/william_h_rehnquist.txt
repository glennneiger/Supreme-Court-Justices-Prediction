justice
rehnquist
mr.
howard,
your
lawsuit
was
not
commenced
until
after
the
seizure
of
the
hostages
by
iran,
was
it?
justice
rehnquist
was
that
after
the
blocking
order?
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
one
that
the
government
has
said
it
would
urge,
and
urge
the
american
petitioners
before
the
tribunal
to
urge
that
there
has
been
such
a
change
of
affairs
that--
justice
rehnquist
do
you
regard
the
later
executive
order
signed
by
president
reagan
as
going
further
than
the
executive
order
signed
by
president
carter?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
district
court
ruled
on
your
takings
clause
claim?
justice
rehnquist
no,
on
your
fifth
amendment--
justice
rehnquist
are
you
referring
to
the...
you're
not
referring
to
the
hostages
act?
you're
referring
to
the
ieepa?
justice
rehnquist
judge
breyer
was
the
first...
wasn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
--your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
is
based
on
the
existence
of
the
ieepa,
isn't
it?
not
just
on
the
president's
power
alone?
justice
rehnquist
the
ieepa
was
passed
the
year
after
that.
justice
rehnquist
so
that
presumably
congress
was
delegating
to
the
president
some
authority
belonging
to
the
political
branches
that
might
be
inconsistent
with
the
fsia?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
more
you
read
the
newspapers,
the
more
doubts
you
have.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
is
this
independent
of
any
compensation
clause
question?
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
government
position
on
that?
justice
rehnquist
so
the
government
doesn't
concede
they
would
have
any
remedy
under
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
if
in
fact
they
do
suffer
loss?
justice
rehnquist
well
but
then,
doesn't
the
government
have
to
answer
the
question,
what
if
they
go
through
all
these
steps
and
come
back
and
can
show
a
loss,
then
do
they
have
a
takings
claim?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
it
does--
justice
rehnquist
that
there
is
no
takings,
and
that
the
president
can
violate
the
bill
of
rights
on
his
own?
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
your
answer
to
justice
brennan
from
the
decision
in
the
railroad
reorganization
cases?
justice
rehnquist
but
there's
no
doubt
that
it
was
enacted
in
terms
by
congress
in
1868,
was
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lee,
let
me
quote
to
you,
if
i
may,
article
v
of
the
china
settlement
agreement,
signed
by
secretary
kreps
and
her
corresponding
chinese
official,
which
is
heavily
relied
on
in
the
government
because
it's
a
1979
document.
and
it
says,
"after
the
date
of
the
signature
of
this
agreement
neither
government
will
present
to
the
other
on
its
behalf
or
on
behalf
of
another
any
claim
encompassed
by
this
agreement.
"
"if
any
such
claim
is
presented
directly
by
a
national
of
one
country
to
the
government
of
another,
that
government
will
refer
it
to
the
government
of
the
national
who
presented
the
claim.
"
now,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
ousting
the
united
states
courts
of
jurisdiction
of
a
claim.
justice
rehnquist
so,
does
that
support
your
claims?
justice
rehnquist
we
aren't
governed
by
the
restatement
though,
are
we?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you...
do
you
disagree,
then,
with
justice
frankfurter's
statement
in
the
steel
seizure
cases
that
just
because
the
power
does
not
reside
in
the
president
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
as
a
whole
doesn't
have
it,
and
just
because
the
government
as
a
whole
has
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
president
by
himself
can
exercise
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
was
a
treaty,
not
any
executive
agreement.
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
think
the
constitution
talks
about--
--we're
getting
into
two
quite
separable
and
different
issues
here.
justice
rehnquist
well,
on
the
steel
seizure
cases,
president
truman's
order
was
posited
on
the
emergency
that
he
felt
existed
and
he
shut
down
the
steel
mills
in
the
korean
conflict.
and
yet
this
court
decided
against
him.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
shack,
what
if
that
agreement
had
included
a
provision
sending
justice
stewart
to
teheran
indefinitely?
now
that
he's
resigned--
--do
you
think
that
would
still
be
binding?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
question
that
we're
facing
here,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
part
of
the
agreement
had
provided
that
for
one
year
no
one
should
criticize
the
ayatollah
in
this
country?
would
the
united
states
be
liable
for
damages
if
any
person
in
this
country
criticized
the
ayatollah?
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
saying
that
under
international
law
they
are
bound
to
carry
out
an
agreement
if
such
an
executive
would
have
done
so.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
this
power
exists
in
the
president
without
any
congressional
delegation?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
congress
said
that
the
president
shall
not
in
the
future
settle
any
foreign
claims?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
president
signed
the
bill?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
you're
not
relying
just
on
the
president
acting
all
by
himself.
you
are
deriving
some
support
from
the
ieepa
end?
justice
rehnquist
not
the
bill
of
rights,
can't
be
overridden
like--
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
howard,
don't
you
think
there's
something
to
professor
henkin's
statement
in
his
treatise
on
international
law,
or
international
agreements,
in
1972,
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
adopted,
that
these
things
really
don't
fit
neatly
into
black
and
white
fields,
and
that
it's
kind
of
a
skewed
situation.
belmont
and
pink
came
up
in
connection
with
a
lump
sum
settlement
case.
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
came
up
in
connection
with
an
entirely
different
situation.
this
comes
up
with
an
entirely
different
situation,
that
to
try
to
piece
together
a
very
neat
set
of
precedents
each
of
which
is
reconcilable
with
one
another
may
just
be
impossible.
and
that
since
each
case
that
comes
here
kind
of
comes
out
of
a
particular
event,
there
just
may
not
be
much
jurisprudence
that
we
can
rely
on
or
lay
down
here.
witness
zittman
and
orvis.
justice
rehnquist
well,
he
can't
conscript
or
raise
and
support
armies
either.
justice
rehnquist
he
can't
raise
and
support
armies.
that's
a
power
entrusted
to
congress.
