justice
jr.
haven't
they
been
selected?
justice
jr.
but
the
other
six
haven't
been
picked,
have
they?
justice
jr.
is
there
any
suggestion
that
we
have
to
decide
whether
they
can
or
cannot...
whether
you
can
or
cannot
go?
justice
jr.
but,
in
any
event,
mr.
howard,
the
form
of
your
clause
requires
preliminary
conciliation
or
arbitration
by
the
three-member
group?
justice
jr.
before
the
clause,
at
least,
requires
you
to
go
to
the
courts
of
iran?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
howard,
your
attachments
were
obtained
based
on
licenses
that
you
secured
under
the
regulations?
justice
jr.
you
mean
that's
because
of
the
availability
of
other
fora?
justice
jr.
the
arbitration
commission
is
one
and
what,
the
courts
of
iran
are
another?
justice
jr.
and
as
for
this
petitioner,
there
is,
i
gather,
also
this
intermediate--
justice
jr.
--yes.
justice
jr.
well,
then,
do
i
understand,
the
government
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
mere
availability
of
another
forum
or
fora,
merely
that,
answers
the
taking
claim?
justice
jr.
that
wasn't
my
question.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
mere
availability
of
these
other
fora
in
and
of
itself
takes,
answers
the
taking
claim?
justice
jr.
it
may
be
at
the
end
of
the
road
they'd
still
have
a
taking
claim
but
not
until
they've
gone
to
the
end
of
the
road.
is
that
correct?
justice
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
lee,
i
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled
exactly
what
the
government's
position
is
as
to
what
if
any
part
of
the
taking
question
we
should
answer?
justice
jr.
either
as
to
the
attachments
or
the?
justice
jr.
so
there's
no
property--
justice
jr.
--now,
what
about
the
claim
settlement?
justice
jr.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals?
i
thought
only
judge
mcgowan
took
that?
justice
jr.
even
by
the
president
himself?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
lee,
i
think
it's
rather
important,
and
jurisdiction
strikes
me
as
quite
the
wrong
approach,
based
on
schooner
peggy.
the
argument
that
the
judiciary
was
stripped
of
jurisdiction,
finding
it
in
the
executive,
was
answered
by
saying,
no,
it
didn't.
justice
jr.
it
just
created
a
new
rule
of
law
which
it
was
the
duty
of
the
appellate
court
to
apply.
justice
jr.
then
are
you
withdrawing
all
this
jurisdictional?
justice
jr.
i
should
say
not.
justice
jr.
no
intrusion
on
the
judicial
power.
justice
jr.
primarily
the
1868
statute?
justice
jr.
mr.
lieberman,
does
your...
this
is
a
political
question...
argument
go
also
to
the
taking
issue?
justice
jr.
in
that
the
whole
works
should
be
dismissed
out
of
the
courts?
justice
jr.
a
court
of
claims
remedy
doesn't
solve
the
takings
question.
you
still
have
to
decide
there
was
a
taking.
justice
jr.
well,
you
were.
justice
jr.
my
problem
on
your
political
question
argument
is
going
to
suggest
that
we
couldn't,
it's
none
of
our
business
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
taking
or
not.
justice
jr.
you
don't
go
that
far?
justice
jr.
that's
not
my
question.
i'm
asking
whether
your
political
question
submission
embraces
whether
or
not
we
should
decide
whether
it's...
or
even
address
the
taking
issue.
justice
jr.
all
right.
then
we
do
address
it,
you
suggest?
justice
jr.
that
was
just
a
tag
end.
justice
jr.
the
new
law
here
is
the
plaintiff
loses.
justice
jr.
it
might
be
a
taking,
but
they--
