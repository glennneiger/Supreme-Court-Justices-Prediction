we
will
hear
arguments
this
morning
in
no.
80-2078,
dames
&
moore
v.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
mr.
howard,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
burger
how
would
that
be
enforced
if
the
government
of
iran?
chief
justice
burger
unless
iran
isolates
itself
totally
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and?
chief
justice
burger
on
foreign
policy,
foreign
relations
matters.
you're
limiting
that,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
burger
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
what
the
president
did
has
the
same
ultimate
consequence
as
though
congress
and
the
president
in
the
usual
legislating
function
adopted
new
substantive
law.
chief
justice
burger
it's
binding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shack.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lieberman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
lieberman.
mr.
howard,
somewhere,
at
your
own
convenience
in
your
rebuttal
time,
for
my
part
i'd
like
to
have
you
touch
on
something
which
we
have
touched
on
the
periphery
but
not
the
core,
at
least
in
my
view.
and
that
is,
how
the
president
of
the
united
states
exercising
his
article
ii
powers
to
conduct
foreign
relations
can
do
so
if
he
cannot
have
regulatory
power
over
suits,
just
hypothetically,
relations,
negotiations,
very
sensitive
negotiations,
whether
hostages
or
some
other
problems
being
conducted
and
250
or
2,500
or
25,000
american
citizens
are
going
to
bring
suits
against
that
other
government.
obviously
that
would
impair,
have
an
impact
on
the
negotiations.
now,
if
the
president
can't
do
that
under
his
article
ii
powers,
how
can
he
carry
out
those
powers?
chief
justice
burger
meanwhile,
in
the
situation
we
have
here,
the
hostages
wait
until
congress
acts,
or
some
delicate
negotiations
with
the
people's
republic
of
china,
for
example,
must
mark
time?
chief
justice
burger
who
would
raise
this
duress
defense?
chief
justice
burger
surely
not
iran?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
chief
justice
burger
but
realistically,
when
a
great
sovereign
has
negotiated
an
agreement,
even
under
duress
or
pressure,
but
having
reached
an
agreement,
can
the
sovereign
then
question
it
on
that
kind
of
a
ground?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
talking
about
congress
or
the
president?
not
just
the
president,
you
say?
chief
justice
burger
--let
me
go
back
to
my
original
hypothetical,
somewhat.
if
the
president
is
negotiating
in
some
delicate,
sensitive
foreign
relations
matter,
whether
like
the
hostages
or
others,
and
you
prevailed
in
this
case,
would
not
the
other
sovereign
in
negotiation
say,
well,
we
are
glad
to
treat
with
your
ambassador,
your
envoy,
but
before
we
conclude
anything
we
want
your
supreme
court
to
pass
on
whether
the
president
has
exceeded
his
powers.
isn't
that
a
natural
consequence
of
your
position?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
putting
you
in
the
negotiation,
and
the
foreign
sovereign
doesn't
say,
go
to
congress.
the
foreign
sovereign
having
heard
from
this
court
once
or
perhaps
on
several
occasions
says,
we
want
to
get
an
opinion
from
your
supreme
court
before
we
come
to
any
agreements
with
you
because
they're
the
last
word.
chief
justice
burger
and
you
suggest
that
would
not
impair
the
president's
power
to
conduct
foreign
relations
and
national
defense
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
