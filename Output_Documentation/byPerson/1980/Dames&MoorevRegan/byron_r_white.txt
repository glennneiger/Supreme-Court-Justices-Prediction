justice
white
--then
you
don't
think,
this
is
a
part
of
your
legal
argument,
i'm
sure,
you
don't
think
zittman
was
overruled
or
limited
by
orvis?
justice
white
yes,
well,
you
can
wait;
i
guess
you
can
wait
on
that.
well,
both
of
them
deal
with
the
twea,
don't
they,
which
was
in
effect
repealed
by
the
ieepa?
justice
white
under
the
ieepa?
justice
white
i'll
wait
until
the
legal
part
of
your
argument.
justice
white
that's
all
right;
go
ahead.
justice
white
well,
if
the
president
is
acting
pursuant
to
a
statute,
he's
hardly
acting
alone,
is
he?
justice
white
but
you
say
that
even
under--
justice
white
--even
with
or
without
congressional
agreement,
you
say
this
has
never
happened?
justice
white
how
about
with
the
aid
of
a
treaty?
justice
white
it
has
happened,
hasn't
it?
justice
white
and
the
schooner,
how
about
the
schooner
peggy?
justice
white
well,
then,
i
take
it
you
say
that
if
we
construe,
if
the
ieepa
is
construed
to
authorize
the
president
to
take
these
steps,
you
agree
that
it's
constitutional
in
this--
--but
they
might
have
to
pay.
they
might
have
to
pay.
justice
white
and
you
agree
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
white
--i
suppose
you
agree
that
congress
could
have
passed
a
statute...
and
of
course
it
has,
in
some
respects
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act...
but
it
could
have
a
statute
and
say,
property
of
foreign
countries
shall
not
be
subject
to
attachment
in
the
united
states.
justice
white
and
they
could
also
authorize
the
president
on
particular
occasions
to
immunize
foreign
property
from
attachment.
now,
you
have
to
argue
that
the
powers
of
the
president
under
the
ieepa,
including
the
power
to
freeze,
did
not
allow
him
to
put
out
an
order,
an
enforceable
order
immunizing
iranian
property
from
attachment.
you
have
to
argue
that.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know
why,
because--
justice
white
--well,
i'm
just
talking
about
the
attachment
issue,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
claim.
justice
white
i
know,
but
that
wouldn't
do
you
any
good
as
far
as
your
attachment
is
concerned.
if
the
president
has
immunized
iranian
property
from
attachment
and
he's
done
it
legally
pursuant
to
his
statutory
powers,
your
attachment
isn't
worth
a
plug
nickel,
it
wouldn't
seem
to
me.
justice
white
right.
and
i
know
what
you
argue,
that
he...
do
you
concede
he
had
the
power
to
license?
justice
white
i
know
you
have
to
argue
that,
but
if
we
happen
to
disagree
with
you
on
that,
then
the
only
question
is,
a
construction
of
his
order
as
to
whether
the
revocability
part
of
it
intended
to
be
revocable
retroactively.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
your
attachment
isn't
worth
anything,
you
certainly
haven't
been
deprived
of
any
property
by
the
vacators
of
your
attachments?
justice
white
and
that's
whether
or
not
he
can
send
the
property
back.
justice
white
if
it
isn't
going
to
do
you
any
good
as
far
as
attachments
are
concerned,
the
property
could
remain
here
as
long
as
his
order
immunizing
it
from
attachment...
your
attachment
isn't
worth
anything.
justice
white
well,
now,
i'm
very
interested
in
what
your
argument
is
as
to
whether
he
has
the
power
to
immunize
the
property
from
attachment,
which
he
purports
to
do
when
he
demands
a
license
to
attach.
now,
why
do
you
think
the
ieepa
does
not
authorize
the
president
to
relieve
foreign
property
from
the
burdens
of
attachment?
justice
white
of
course,
there
were
licenses
in
orvis,
weren't
there?
justice
white
i
take
it
that
act
also
recognizes
attachments
in
certain
circumstances?
justice
white
including
this
one?
justice
white
why
couldn't
he
stop
prejudgment
attachments,
then?
justice
white
i
take
it,
if
there
hadn't
been
the
freeze,
if
the
president
had
taken
no
action,
your
lawsuit
under
the
fsia
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
and
you
could
have
gotten
judgment
and
levied?
justice
white
but
the
government
says
the
president
is
authorized
by
the
ieepa
to
take
it
out
of
the
judicial
track
and
put
it
in
the
diplomatic.
justice
white
at
least,
that
the
president
is
empowered
to
stop
your
lawsuit
and
to
lift
your
attachments.
justice
white
so,
am
i
to
conclude
that
you
suggest
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
in
this
case,
or
that
the
issue
of
the
remedy
in
the
court
of
claims
may
be
decided?
justice
white
i
thought
the
government's
position
up
to
now
had
been
that
that
issue
was
premature
also.
justice
white
--you
suggest
what
the
answer
is.
justice
white
if
there's
still
a
taking,
you
think
there's
a
remedy
for
it?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
mr.
lee,
i
take
it
then
the
government
position
is
that
we
certainly
shouldn't
decide
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
one
that
the
tribunal
does
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know,
that's
not
so
clear.
the
argument's
pretty
strong,
at
least
in
some
of
the
cases
pending
around,
that
the
treaty
would
exclude
some
of
these
claims.
it
seems
to
be,
looks
clear,
and...
but
if
the
tribunal
does
not
have
jurisdiction
and
the
claimant
is
remitted
to
the
courts
and
he
gets
a
judgment,
what
the
treaty
has
done,
since
the
united
states
promised
to
end
all
suits,
in
the
instance
i
am
posing,
that
suit
wouldn't
be
over.
if
there
was
a
judgment,
however,
it
would
not
be
enforceable
anywhere
else
in
the
world,
would
it?
justice
white
so,
just
because
in
international
law
the
united
states
will
have
broken
its
treaty
obligation.
justice
white
well,
at
least,
mr.
lee,
it
seems
to
me
your
very
assertion
that
the
taking
question
is
premature
with
respect
to
the
claims
is
an
assertion
that
as
of
right
now
there
has
been
no
taking.
you
have
to
at
least
say
that,
don't
you?
justice
white
that's
the
united
states
position,
not
just
mr.
lee's,
i
take
it?
justice
white
are
you
speaking
of
the
1868
statute?
justice
white
why
don't
you
have...
you
have
that
here.
justice
white
you
have
a
judgment
of
a
district
court.
justice
white
well,
that
just
begs
the
question.
justice
white
well,
it
didn't
really,
did
it?
it
just
said,
it
just
said
it
changed
the
rule
of
law.
justice
white
the
court
said
that
the
appellate
court
should
apply
the
law
as
it
finds
it
on
appeal,
and
the
law
then
changed.
justice
white
it
wasn't
a
jurisdictional
decision,
was
it?
justice
white
and
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
president
by
himself
under
his
article
ii
powers
may
change
the
law
of
the
land
that
the
court
must
apply?
justice
white
well,
in
this
case.
in
this
case.
justice
white
and
without
a
treaty
or
without
acting
pursuant
to
any
statute.
and
there
schooner
peggy
doesn't
support
you
because
it
was
a
treaty.
justice
white
is
it
fair
to
ask
you
a
more
technical
question?
you've
addressed
it
in
your
main
brief.
in
the
orvis
case...
you're
familiar
with
it?
justice
white
if
the
president
had
not
vested
the
assets
in
that
case,
there
had
been
no
vesting
order,
just
the
freeze
followed
by
an
attachment,
would
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
have
allowed
the
president
to
unfreeze
the
assets
and
return
the
assets
to
the
foreign
nation
free
of
the
attachment?
justice
white
well,
orvis
said
that
the
attachment
was
good
against
the
foreign
country.
it
wasn't
good
against
the
president's
vesting,
but
it
was
perfectly
good
despite
the
freeze
against
the
foreign
debtor.
now,
how
can
you
say
what
you've
just
said?
justice
white
whether
there
was
a
taking
still
remains
to
be
decided.
justice
white
but
that's
a
remedy
there.
if
we
don't
decide
that
there
was
a
taking,
that
would
be
on
the
threshold
in
the
court
of
claims.
justice
white
--mr.
howard,
i'm
not
sure
i
asked
you
when
you
were
first
up,
but
the
question
i
asked
one
of
your
colleagues,
in
orvis
if
there
had
been
no
vesting,
the
lien,
the
attachment,
would
always
have
been
good
against
the
foreign
sovereign?
justice
white
yes,
and
doesn't...
the
president
could,
your
position
is,
could
not
have
transferred
those
assets
free
of
that
attachment?
justice
white
and
that's
what...
and
orvis
did
say
that
the
attachment
was
good
against
the--
justice
white
now,
do
you
have
any
further
argument
about
that?
is
there
any
case
or
any
other
cases
that
indicate
the
same
thing?
zittman,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
orvis...
but
orvis
said
that
the
lien
was
good
against
a
foreign
sovereign.
justice
white
williams
said
it
wasn't
good
against
the
president,
once
he
had
vested.
justice
white
your
argument
about
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
no
stronger
than
it
is
under
the
ieepa,
is
it?
it's
the
same
language,
isn't
it?
justice
white
except
for
the
vesting?
justice
white
what
authority,
do
you
say,
what
authority?
is
orvis
your
best
case
for
saying
that
he
would
have
no
authority...
in
orvis...
to
have
transferred
the
assets
to
the
foreign
nation
without
a
vesting
free
of
the
attachment?
justice
white
well,
that's
just
your
argument
in
this
respect.
shouldn't
you
make
the
same
crazy-sort-of-a-notion
argument
as
you
do
with
the
ieepa?
justice
white
well,
if
the
government
also,
though,
defends
the
dismissal?
of
this
case,
isn't
it?
on
the
grounds
that
there's
no
cause
of
action.
justice
white
which
means
that
there's
a
new
rule
of
law.
the
principle
of
the
action
brought
after--
justice
white
and
of
course,
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
he's
been
forbidden
to
do
this.
justice
white
all
right,
it's
been,
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
