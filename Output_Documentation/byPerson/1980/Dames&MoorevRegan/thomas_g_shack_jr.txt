mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
despite
the
plethora
of
briefs
and
the
numerous
parties
in
amici,
the
questions
presented
to
the
court
in
this
proceeding
are
not
particularly
abstruse.
they
do
not
require
broad
sweeping
pronouncements
from
the
court.
i
would
submit
that
the
attachment
issues
are
essentially
and
simply
issues
of
statutory
construction
and
should
be
governed
by
the
basic
principle
that
statutes
should
be
construed
so
as
to
avoid
conflicts
between
them
and
in
terms
of
international
law
statutes
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
cause
a
breach
of
an
international
agreement
or
international
law.
i
have
in
the
limited
time
four
simple
points
which
i
would
like
to
address.
the
first,
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
executed
an
international
agreement
between
the
parties
on
january
19,
1981.
both
of
the
sovereigns
are
in
the
process
of
implementing
their
obligations
under
the
agreement
and
each
expects
the
other
sovereign
to
continue
to
fulfill
those
obligations.
as
a
matter
of
international
law
it
is
a
well
recognized
principle
that
an
international
agreement
is
binding
despite
any
contrary
domestic
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
justice
stewart
would
probably
have
to
pack
a
bag
and...
the
short
answer
is,
to
whatever
extent
such
an
agreement
would
infringe
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
citizen
and
was
struck
down
as
being
unconstitutional,
it
would
not
be
binding
as
a
matter
of
domestic
law,
and
i
doubt
that
anyone
would
try
to
put
justice
stewart
on
a
plane.
but
whether
the
united
states
would
be
in
violation
of
such
an
agreement
and
thus
answerable
for
damages
in
such
an
event,
i
think
that
under
international
law
it
would
be.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
no,
that
is
not
the
question
that
we
are
faced
with
here
today.
the
basic
question
is,
there
is
an
agreement
between
the
two
countries,
the
united
states
is
under
an
obligation
to
accomplish,
to
restore
iran
to
its
financial
position
as
it
existed
prior
to
november
14,
1979,
and
to
accomplish
that
the
united
states
has
to
assure
the
free
mobility
of
iran's
assets
within
this
jurisdiction.
if
the
united
states
does
not
in
fact
accomplish
the
restoration
of
iran's
financial
position,
and
if
it
in
fact
does
not
accomplish
satisfaction
of
the
obligations
imposed
under
paragraphs
4
through
9
of
the
declarations,
specifically
the
transfer
of
specific
categories
of
assets
to
iran,
then
the
united
states
would
arguably
be
in
violation
of
the
agreement
and
under
international
law
liable
for
damages.
since
the
international
tribunal
which
has
been
referred
to
today
does
in
fact
exist,
and
since
it
does
in
fact
have
jurisdiction
over
disputes
of
this
nature
between
the
parties,
then
the
tribunal
would
be
in
a
position
and
arguably
has
the
authority
to
impose
a
damage
judgment
against
the
united
states
in
the
full
amount
of
iran's
assets
as
they
exist
in
this
country.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
well,
again,
despite
the
inconsistency
with
domestic
law,
the
united
states
would
be
obligated
by
virtue
of
its
good
faith
commitment
to
attempt
to
accomplish
the
objectives
of
the
agreement.
it
is
unlikely
that
any
executive
would
knowingly
or
willfully
attempt
to
deliberately
circumscribe
the
rights
of
a
citizen
or
citizens.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
yes,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
true.
if
the
executive
had
made
such
an
agreement,
the
united
states
would
be
obligated
to
attempt
to
carry
out
the
obligations
of
the
agreement.
i
observe
that
this
international
principle
which
says
that
international
law
is
binding
regardless
of
domestic
law
also
leads
me
to
the
fourth
point,
which
is
that
the
courts
of
this
country
have
traditionally
construed
domestic
law
in
such
a
way
as
wherever
possible
not
to
cause
a
breach
of
an
international
agreement
with
a
foreign
sovereign.
under
the
algerian
declarations,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
the
united
states
is
obligated
to
restore
iran's
financial
position
as
it
existed
prior
to
november
14,
1979,
and
to
assure
the
free
mobility
of
its
assets
within
this
jurisdiction
by
that
date.
as
i
said,
that's
paragraphs
4
through
9
and
the
trigger
date
on
that
requirement
is
july
19
of
this
year.
additionally,
the
united
states
has
other
obligations
under
the
agreement.
it's
obligated
under
general
principle
b
of
the
general...
there
are
two
basic
declarations.
there's
a
general
declaration
which
sets
forth
the
general
rights
and
responsibilities
or
obligations
of
the
parties,
and
the
second
declaration
which
essentially
establishes
the
international
arbitral
tribunal
and
which
sets
forth
the
basic
operating
procedures
for
that
tribunal.
but
under
the
general
principles,
general
agreement
or
general
principles,
the
united
states
is
also
obligated
to
terminate
all
legal
proceedings
in
the
united
states,
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
it's
obligated
to
nullify
all
attachments
and
judgments.
it's
obligated
to
prohibit
all
further
litigation
on
the
claims
which
are
the
subject
of
the
agreement,
and
it's
obligated
to
bring
about
the
termination
of
the
claims
through
binding
arbitration.
those
are
the
general
principles
which
bind
the
united
states.
there
are
others,
but
those
are
the
salient
ones
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
both
parties,
as
i've
said,
have
agreed
to
the
establishment
of
an
international
tribunal
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
american
claimants,
or
claims
of
the
respective
nationals
against
the
others.
iran,
however,
has--
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
--mr.
justice
stevens,
what
is
my
understanding
of
the
obligation
of
the?
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
yes,
the
clear
language
of
the
agreement
seems
to
require
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
well,
the
tribunal
itself
will
probably
be
the
ultimate
judge
of
that
since
it
has
jurisdiction
on
such
matters,
but
the
clear
language
requires
termination
rather
than
suspension.
presumably
the
united
states
in
any
dispute
on
that
matter
would
submit
to
the
tribunal
that
suspension
has
accomplished
the
same
thing
and
that
termination
will
follow
adjudications
or
awards
by
the
tribunal.
but
until--
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
--the
agreement
provides
that
where
there
is
a
specific
forum
clause
containing
specific
language
with
respect
to
iran's
jurisdiction
that
those
cases
will
not
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunal;
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
i
believe
that
it
would.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
well,
i
believe
the...
i
believe
that
the
power
of
the
executive...
or
the
power
of
the
congress
to
attach
the
assets
of
the
foreign
sovereign
is,
when
it's
specifically
enunciated,
prevails.
mr.
thomas
g.
shack,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
one
moment,
i'd
just
like
to
conclude.
iran
is
in
fact
fulfilling
its
obligations
under
the
agreement
by
appointing
arbitrators
and
the
arbitral
tribunal
is
in
existence
and
operating,
and
as
of
july
1
will
be
meeting
with
respect
to
establishing
new
procedures.
