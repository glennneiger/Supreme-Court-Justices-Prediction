mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
every
indication
that
if
you
look
at
the
situation
just
from
the
standpoint
of
the
claimants
themselves
in
this
case,
the
entire
body
of
american
claimants
taken
as
a
whole,
that
their
situation
today
is
much
better
than
it
was
prior
to
the
november
14,
1979,
order
before
the
government
ever
entered
this
picture.
on
the
one
hand
the
problems
that
the
claimants
faced
absent
any
kind
of
action
by
the
government
included
these.
there
were
serious
problems
in
most
of
the
cases
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
in
many
of
the
cases
there
were
also
both
sovereign
immunity
and
active
state
defenses,
and
with
regard
to
the
attachment
or
the
property
that
might
be
available
for
the
levy
of
execution
following
judgments,
if
any
were
ever
entered,
the
november,
1979,
order
was
made
in
response
to
reports
that
the
government
of
iran
was
about
to
withdraw
its
funds.
now,
contrast
that
with
the
circumstances
that
exist
because
of
the
acts
that
were
taken
by
the
president,
his
january
19
orders
and
the
subsequent
order
of
president
reagan
on
february
24.
in
the
first
place,
all
problems
of
jurisdiction,
sovereign
immunity,
and
act
of
state
have
been
stripped
away.
in
addition,
there
is
a
settlement
account
in
the
amount
of
$1
billion
that
is
established,
and
the
government
of
iran
has
guaranteed
to
pay
all
of
the
claims,
both
expropriation
and
commercial
claims,
presently
estimated
to
be
on
the
order
of
about
2,500.
and
that
when
the
settlement
account
drops
below--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
that
when
this
settlement
account
drops
below
one-half
million
dollars,
then
the
government
of
iran
is
obligated
to
replenish
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
traditional
ways
that
international
obligations
are
enforced.
their
obligation,
their
stature
in
the
community
of
nations
is
at
stake.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
another
available
remedy
because
of
this
settlement,
justice
stewart,
that
was
also
not
available
prior
to
the
agreement
itself,
and
that
is
that
any
of
the
tribunal's
awards
are
enforceable
in
the
courts
of
any
country
in
the
world.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
does
not,
and
of
course
this
court
cannot
know
and
no
one
can
know
to
what
extent
any
country
may
conform
with
its
international
obligations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
yet,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
it
would
be
improper
for
an
american
court
to
base
a
judgment
on
the
assumption
that
a
foreign
nation
will
or
will
not
conform
to
its
obligations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
historical
fact
also
includes
the
fact
that
in
addition
to
the
settlement
fund
in
the
initial
amount
of
$1
billion,
which
is
more
than
they
had
in
the
first
place--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--they
do
also
have
the
right
to
go
into
the
courts
of
any
country
in
the
world
and
when
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
country
that
is
very
active
in
commercial
oil
international
transactions,
the
likelihood
that
there
will
be
assets
available
in
many
countries
of
the
world
is
rather
high.
and
even--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--from
the
rest
of
the
world,
and
it
would
be
paying
a
very
high
price
if
it
did
that,
of
course.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
all
i'm
saying
is,
justice
stevens,
that
while
it
is
true,
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
pink,
that
this
kind
of
authority
in
the
president
has
a
much
broader
use
than
just
the
assurance
of
the
rights
of
american
claimants.
but
this
is
one
of
the
bargaining
chips,
if
you
will,
this
is
part
of
a
leverage
that
the
president
can
and
should
use
in
achieving
the
normalization
of
relations
with
foreign
countries.
my
only
point
is
that
in
this
case
the
body
of
american
claimants
taken
as
a
whole
is
much
better
off
than
they
were
prior
to
the
time
that
the
government
ever
entered
this
picture.
now
there
may--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
all
i
am
saying
is,
justice
stewart,
that
the
proposition
that
this
was
used
solely
as
a
bargaining
chip
for
the
release
of
the
hostages
does
not
tell
the
entire
story.
and
with
respect
even
to
the
question--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
so
far
i've
only
been
going
for
five
minutes
and
i
do
intend
to
get
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--this
was
solely
a
matter
of
flushing
out
the
facts.
let
me
come,
then,
to
the
legal
issue.
or,
let
me
cover
one
other
matter
insofar
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
and
that
is
these
forum
clauses.
even
there
the
claimants
are
considerably
better
off
because
of
the
fact
that
with
the
agreement
they
do
have
an
additional
argument
that
was
not
available
to
them
initially
flowing
from
the
combination
of
article
v,
which
refers
to,
specifically,
to
changed
circumstances,
and
article
ii,
which
talks
about
the
fact
that
it
must
be
a
binding
contract
which
in
turn
can
tie
back
to
article
v.
turning
then
to
the
law.
in
our
view,
there
is
a
single
issue
that
undergirds
both
of
the
questions,
that
is,
both
the
question
of
power
to
nullify
attachments
and
transfer
assets,
and
also
the
power
to
settle
claims.
and
it
concerns
the
power
of
the
president
to
act
in
an
international
crisis
whose
nature
and
magnitude
are
such
that
if
it
to
be
resolved
it
has
to
be
resolved
by
one
person
and
one
person
alone,
and
under
our
system
of
argument
that
person
is
the
president.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
i
hope
to
get
to
the
compensation--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
government's
position
on
compensation
is
this,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
petitioner's
claims
for
compensation
are
premature
at
this
time.
the
reason
that
they're
premature
is
that
no
one
knows
whether
they
have
suffered
any
damage
or
not
because
we
don't
know
and
we
cannot
know
that
unless
and
until
the
tribunal
has
completed
its
work.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
find
it
difficult
to
take
the
position
that
the
exception
that
judge
duffy
found
in
the
tucker
act
jurisdiction
under
the
treaty
exception
could
be
applicable.
and
the
reason
is
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
hughes
aircraft
v.
united
states,
that
turns
on
whether
"plaintiff's
claim
could
conceivably
exist
independently
of
and
separate
and
apart
from
the
subject
treaty.
"
and
this
one,
i
think,
simply
doesn't.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
i
think
it
is
premature
and
the
reason
that
it's
premature
is
because
of
the
fact
that
we
don't
know
as
of
this
point
in
time
whether
or
not
any
damage
has
been
suffered
or
will
be
suffered
by
these
claimants.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
principally
what
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--conciliation
effort.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because,
under
president
reagan's
february
24
order,
all
that
happens
to
these
federal
claims
is
that
they
are
suspended,
they
are
not
terminated,
and
in
the
event
that
the
tribunal
determines
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
then
that
suspension
itself
is
terminated
and
they
can
proceed
with
their
claims.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
makes
it--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
makes
it
premature
in
this
case--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no.
it
does
not.
it
is
conceivable--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
but
it
need
not
be
answered
in
this
case.
but
to
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
if
it
does--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
no;
no.
clearly
that
is
not.
but
that
rather--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
and
that
remedy
is
the
tucker
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
the
treaty
exception
simply
does
not
apply.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
have
been
suspended.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
language
of
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
those
are
the
algerian
declarations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that
that
was
the
purpose,
was
to
terminate.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
the
implementing
order
did
not
go
quite
that
far.
and
the
relevant
order
here
is
president
reagan's
order
of
february
24,
it
says
that
the
claims
are
suspended,
and
the
effect
is
this,
that
in
the
event
that
a
tribunal
determines
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
then
the
suspension
is
lifted
and
they're
free
to
pursue
the
remedy
in
the
courts.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
not
necessarily,
it's
more--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
it
is
settled
in
the
sense
that,
justice
powell,
that
it
is
suspended
in
the
courts.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
lose
the
case.
something
like
abstention,
they
simply
hold
onto
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to
await
the
outcome,
to
await
the
outcome
of
the
determination
by
the
tribunal.
in
the
event
that
the
tribunal
determines
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
then
they
are
free
to
pursue
their
claim
in
the
court.
in
the
event
that
the
tribunal
determines
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction,
then
it
is
terminated.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
a
question,
of
course,
for
another
day.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
certainly
do
not.
we
think
that
the
right
position
is
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
general
objective.
that
matter
of
terminating
the
claims
was
a
statement
that
was
made
at
the
beginning,
a
broad
statement
of
purpose,
and
our
position
would
be
that
the
suspension,
awaiting
the
outcome
of
the
determination
by
the
tribunal,
is
generally
consistent
with
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
not.
and
i--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
might
conceivably
be
an
argument
to
that
effect,
at
that
point
in
time.
i'd
like
to
come
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
think,
justice
brennan,
well,
my
end
of
that,
and
here
is
our
position.
we
think
that
you
could
decide
at
this
time
that
there
is
no
taking.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
either
as
to
the
attachments
or
the
claim
settlement.
and
briefly,
the
reason
is
this.
as
to
the
attachments,
it's
because
the
only
attachments
in
any
of
the
cases
that
are
at
issue
here,
were
attachments
that
were
secured
pursuant
to
the
revocable
license.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
they
derive
their
life
from
that
license
and
that
license
has
now
been
canceled.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
all
right,
now
as
to
the
claim
settlement,
it
turns
on
this
matter
that
we've
just
been
talking
about.
all
that
the
president
has
done
is
to
suspend
those
claims.
part
of
them,
the
tribunal
will
determine
that
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
as
to
those,
there
has
been
no
taking
because
they
can
come
back
into
court.
sans
attachment,
to
be
sure,
but
those
attachments
also
owed
their
life
to
the
license.
now,
with
regard
to
the
others,
where
the
tribunal
either
determines
that
to
make
an
award
or
not
to
make
an
award,
then
the
only
way
that
you
could
say
that
there
has
been
a
taking
is
to
say
that
by
settlement
of
a
dispute
through
another
alternative
means
of
dispute
resolution
is
a
taking.
and
particularly
in
today's
world,
with
all
the
attention
that
is
being
given
to
the
matter
of
alternative
means
of
dispute
resolution,
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
for
this
court
to
enter
a
judgment
that
settlement
through
alternative
means
of
dispute
resolution
raise
article
iii
problems.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
may
be...
those
of
course
are...
the
difference
there
is
differences
in
degree.
and
it's
a
question
of
imminence
and
the
court
may
well
want
to
say.
the
way
i
distinguish
it
is,
that
we
simply
cover
the
waterfront,
in
my
view,
with
all
of
the
actions
that
the
president
did
and
that
there
is
a
solid
basis
for
this
court
to
say
that
under
no
circumstance
can
there
be
a
taking,
because
you
have
both
the
attachments
covered
by
the
license
point
and
you
also
have
the
claim
settlement
authority
covered
by
the
fact
of
the
suspension.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
as
of
right
now,
there
certainly
has
not
been
a
taking.
now,
to
finish
it
on
out,
what
you
could
not
do
today
is
to
say
that
there
has
been
a
taking.
i
think
you
can
today
say
there
has
not.
what
you
could
not
do
today
is
to
say
that
there
has,
and
that
would
bring
you
to
the
question
that
everyone
wants
me
to
answer
and
that
i
think
i
have
answered,
and
that
is,
in
that
event
is
there
a
remedy?
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
as
i
read
that
treaty
exception
to
the
tucker
act,
that
there
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now
coming
to
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
president
to
transfer
the
assets
and
nullify
the
attachments,
it
is
agreed
on
all
sides
that
that
is
covered
by
the
ieepa,
and
i
think
little
more
need
be
said
by
that.
that
puts
it
in
category
one
of
justice
jackson's
three
categories.
i
understand
mr.
howard's
statement
that
it
is
very
broad
language,
but
i
think
that
relates
only
to
the
taking
question,
which
i've
already
covered,
and
does
not
pertain
to
the
president's
power.
moreover,
coming
out
of
this
court's
declarations
in
united
states
v.
pink
and
the
curtiss-wright
case,
there
is
certainly
a
great
deference
in
these
matters
of
delegations
of
broad
authority
to
the
president.
and
indeed,
in
the
ieepa
itself,
it
says
that
this
power
will
be
exercised
only
with
respect
to
an
unusual
and
extraordinary
threat
which
amounts
to
a
national
emergency.
let
me
come
then
to
what
i
regard
as
the
hardest
problem
in
the
case,
and
that
is,
this
power
of
the
president
to
settle
outstanding
claims.
there
is
no
question
that
this
aspect
of
the
case
does
not
fit
as
neatly
within
any
identifiable
congressional
statute
as
does
the
first
powers.
we
think,
for
openers,
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
was
exactly
right,
or
at
least
the
two
judges
who
agree
with
us
on
this
issue,
that
it
falls
within
the
hostage
act.
let
me
say
just
briefly
that
it
falls
squarely
within
the
exact
language
of
the
hostage
act.
there
is
some
question
whether
this
old
1868
statute
was
really
intended
to
deal
with
this
particular--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
judge
mcgowan,
but
also
judge
jameson
agreed
with
him
on
that
issue.
there
was
a
separate
opinion,
but--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
judge
mikva
was
on
the
other
side
of
that
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there's
some
dispute
about
that
also.
that
is
one
of
the
raging
debates
as
to
whether
it's
always
been
called
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
and
whatever
else
congress
did
or
did
not
intend
to
do,
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
president
the
kind
of
power
that
they
gave
him,
and
to
express
their
view
in
the
exact
language
that
they
used,
and
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--and
that
is
the
argument
against
using
this
statute
in
this
instance.
but
if
there
is
no
question
that
if
there
is
a
defect
in
that
respect,
it
is
a
defect
essentially
with
congress,
particularly
when
you
take
into
account
what
this
court
said
in
curtiss-wright
and
united
states
v.
pink
about
the
way
you
approach
the
congressional
authorizations
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs.
but
let
me
go
on,
now,
to
what
i
think
is
an
even
more
significant
point
in
this
respect.
and
that
is,
that
even
if
you
can't
fit
it
within...
even
if
you
were
to
decide
that
the
hostage
act
does
not
apply,
justice
jackson
in
the
guidelines
that
he
gave
indicated
that
you
get
the
additional
force
of
article
i
power
added
to
article
ii
power
when
you
have
the
implied
approval
of
congress.
this
simply
is
not
an
area
in
which
the
interbranch
relationships
between
congress
and
the
president
have
been
characterized
by
contention
and
by
interbranch
struggle.
rather,
it
has
been
an
area
in
which
there
has
been
a
continuing
recognition
by
congress
of
the
existence
of
claims
settlement
authority
and
periodic
enactments
to
support
it.
for
example,
at
the
time
that
the
ieepa
was
enacted,
the
congress
observed
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
authorized
blocking
orders
was
that
they
are
"generally
the
most
effective
means
of
achieving
settlement
of
united
states
claims.
"
and
in
addition,
in
such
enactments
as
the
international
claims
settlement
act
and
the
work
of
the
foreign
claims
settlement
commission
and
the
periodic
reenactment
by
congress
reflecting
the
work
of
that
commission,
in
the
reports
that
are
made
to
congress
under
the
ieepa,
and
generally
just
across
the
boards,
this
has
been
an
area
in
which
the
legislative
branch
has
recognized
the
existence
of
claims
settlement
authority
and
has
periodically
acted
to
implement
and
to
support
it.
now,
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
agree.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
no.
it
does
not
get
us
to
the
article
iii
question.
all
it
gets
us
to
is
the
fact
that
the
claims
settlement
authority
does
exist,
that
it
is
an
authority
that
is
of
longstanding
recognition
and
practice,
and
that
it
is
one
that
has
long
been
recognized
by
congress.
i
intend
to
come
to
the
article
iii
question
in
just
a
moment.
i
just
would
like
to...
well,
i'd
like
to
say
before
i
get
there,
that
in
addition
to
congressional
recognition
this
is
an
authority
that
in
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
quoting
professor
henkin,
"is
an
established
international
practice
reflecting
traditional
international
theory.
"
but
this
court
in
united
states
v.
pink
characterized
it
as
a
modest
implied
power
of
the
president
as
to
which
effectiveness
in
handling
the
delicate
problems
of
foreign
relations
requires
no
less.
and
finally,
it
is
a
practice
so
well
established
that
it
is
reflected
as
black-letter
law
in
section
213
of
the
second
restatement
of
the
foreign
relations
law
of
the
united
states.
so
we're
not
dealing
here
with
something
that
is
just
a
newcomer
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
proposition--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
no,
of
course
not.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
a
practice
that
is
well
recognized,
well
established,
recognized
not
only
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
pink,
and
it
has
a
long
paragraph
on
the
importance
of
claims
settlement
authority
by
scholars
and
by
congress
itself.
and
that
is
as
a
prelude
to
this
point,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
proposition
that
a
bill
that
was
drafted
and
lobbied
by
the
two
executive
branch
departments
that
most
depend
and
utilize
that
claims
settlement
authority,
would
have
had
as
its
purpose
to
take
away
that
very
authority
without
ever
saying
so,
almost
borders
on
the
absurd.
and
indeed,
the
few
references
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
to
claims
settlement
authority
are
to
the
effect
that
it
exists.
even
the
quote
from
mr.
ristau,
which
mr.
howard
referred
to,
acknowledges
the
existence
of
the
claims
settlement
authority.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question,
what
about
jurisdiction
and
what
about
settlement
of
the
claims
through
submitting
them
to
arbitration?
the
court
of
appeals...
both
of
them...
for
the
1st
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
correctly
reasoned
that
this
was
an
effort
not
to
modify
the
power
of
the
courts,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
to
decide
this
case,
but
rather
the
substantive
rule
of
law
that
the
courts
are
to
apply.
all
the
focus
of
all
of
the
executive
orders
is
very
careful
on
the
claim,
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
that
is
held
by
the
claimants
and
not
on
the
power
of
the
courts.
and
as
a
consequence,
the
judge
in
this
case
correctly
dismissed
this
case,
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
on
which
relief
could
be
granted.
now,
the
fact
is,
of
course,
that
as
a
result
of
something
that
the
government
has
done,
american
courts
will
not
be
deciding
some
of
these
cases.
but
there
are
a
number
of
instances
in
which
that
circumstance
is
true,
that
has
never
been
thought
to
give
rise
to
article
iii
problems.
for
example,
the
government
may
settle
a
case
after
it
is
pending
in
court.
in
addition,
prior
to
1976,
the
government
frequently
appeared
in
court
and
suggested
that
sovereign
immunity
applied,
and
that
had
the
effect
of
taking
the
case
away
from
the
courts.
and
finally,
it
persists
to
this
day
that
the
government
may
take
a
position
with
respect
to
act
of
state
that
has
the
effect
of
taking
the
case
out
of
the
courts.
now,
on
this
issue,
schooner
peggy
is
absolutely
dispositive.
when
mr.
howard
takes
the
position
that
with
respect
to
the
basic
issue
of
claims
settlement
authority
schooner
peggy
is
distinguishable
because
it
was
a
treaty,
parenthetically,
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
that
it's
true
that
schooner
peggy
did
involve
a
treaty,
but
when
by
the
time
you
combine
the
holding
and
the
rationale
in
schooner
peggy
with
the
rationale,
with
the
statement
by
this
court
in
pink
concerning
settlement
authority,
that
those
two
taken
together
make
a
pretty
powerful
argument
for
the
existence
of
settlement
authority.
but
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--by
the
president
himself;
that
is
correct,
as
a
matter
of
his
article
ii
power.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
do
agree
with
that
statement,
justice
rehnquist,
and
it
is
of
course
consistent
with
the
trichotomy,
if
you
will,
by
justice
jackson
in
that
same
case,
that
it's
simply
a
matter,
if
you
have
both
the
president
acting
with
his
article
ii
power
and
congress
acting
with
its
article
i
power,
then
it's
all
the
stronger.
and
if
you
have
the
congress
taken
away,
then
it's
weaker.
but
coming
back
to
the
point
of
claims
settlement
authority,
justice
frankfurter
also
said...
this
is
the
clearest
statement
that
you
have
anywhere...
in
united
states
v.
pink,
that
it
is
simply
indisputable
that
the
president
has
the
claims
settlement
authority.
but,
coming
back
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
schooner
peggy
may
or
may
not
be
distinguishable
on
the
basic
issue
of
the
president's
claims
settlement
authority.
we
think
that
peggy
plus
pink
makes
a
pretty
powerful
combination
in
that
respect.
but
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
schooner
peggy
is
absolutely
dispositive,
and
a
ruling
could
not
come
down
by
this
court
that
what
the
president
did
here
amounts
to
an
article
iii
violation
without
overruling
schooner
peggy
for
this
reason:
schooner
peggy
is
an
a
fortiori
case
from
dames
&
moore
on
this
issue,
because
what
you
had
in
schooner
peggy
was
a
final
judgment,
which
we
do
not
have
in
this...
excuse
me...
there
was
a
judgment
out
of
the
circuit
court
entitling
the
claimants
in
that
case
to
their
prize.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
except
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
that
judgment
was
entered
in
violation
of
the
president's
freeze
order
and--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
right;
all
right.
maybe
it's
not
a
fortiori.
i
think
it
is,
but
i'll
concede
for
the
moment
that
it's
not.
the
point
is
this
that
while
that
judgment
was
pending,
or
while
review
of
that
judgment
was
pending
before
this
court,
the
president
entered
into
a
treaty
which
was
approved
by
the
senate
depriving
this
court
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
it
changed
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
stand
corrected.
it
changed
the
rule
of
law.
and
that's
exactly
what
has
happened--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
right.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
point.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
point.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
what
the
court
said
in
schooner
peggy
is
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
marshall
made
it
very
clear
that
all
that
they
were
doing
there--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
and
now
my
point
is
this,
that
if
you
did
look
at
what
happened
in
schooner
peggy,
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
the
president
could
no
more
do
it
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
than
he
could
do
it
on
his
own.
and
that's
the
only
point
that
i'm
making,
i
apologize
for
that
confusion,
but
our
point
is
not
that
they
were
dealing
with
jurisdiction,
and
in
fact
the
court
made
it
very
clear
in
that
schooner
peggy
case
that
if
subsequent
to
the
judgment
and
before
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court
a
law
intervenes
and
positively
changes
the
rule
of
law
which
governs,
the
law
must
be
obeyed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
a
case
where
he
is
exercising--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
this
case,
that's
right,
under
the
facts
and
circumstances--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
was
a
treaty,
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
treaty
distinction
is
irrelevant
insofar
as
the
distinction
between
the
dispositive
rule
of
law,
supplying
the
rule
of
law
is
concerned.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
it
is
our
position--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
it
is
our
position
that
he
has
the
power
to
do
that,
pursuant
to
his
article
ii
power,
but
in
this
particular
case,
for
reasons
that
i've
discussed
just
a
moment
ago,
that
he
also
had
the
support
of
the
article
i
power
behind
him
for
the
reasons--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
one.
and
the
other
is
the
implied
authority
that
comes
from
the
continuing
pattern
of
cooperation
between
congress
and
the
president.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
without
any
question,
without
any
question,
in
these
foreign
relations
matters.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
except
that
we're
saying,
in
addition,
that
in
this
case
you
also
have
the
additional
force
of
the
congressional
directive
behind
it.
significant
in
that
respect,
that
in
enacting
the
ieepa
congress
clarified
that
nothing
in
that
act
was
intended
"to
impede
the
settlement
of
claims
of
united
states
citizens
against
foreign
countries.
"
and
that
brings
me
back
to
where
i
started,
and
that
is
that
the
principle
that
has
to
govern
both
of
the
questions
in
this
case
is
this,
that
a
crisis
such
as
that
which
we
underwent
in
this
country
for
14
months
does
not
occur
often.
but
on
those
rare
occasions
when
it
does
occur,
followed
by
the
opportunity
for
settlement
on
honorable
and
reasonable
terms,
then
someone
has
to
have
the
authority
to
decide
whether
to
settle
it
or
not.
and
this
is
your
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
does
fall
within
the
foreign
affairs
powers.
someone
has
to
be
able
to
act,
to
act
without
delay,
and
to
act
with
authority.
under
our
system
of
government
that
has
to
be
the
president.
i
submit
that
it
would
simply
be
unacceptable
for
this
nation
or
any
other
to
lack
that
kind
of
power
under
that
kind
of
circumstance.
it
would,
as
this
court
said
in
pink,
be
in
derogation
of
sovereignty
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh
the...
there
was
one
proposition,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
which
all
opinions
in
the
steel
seizure
case
were
in
agreement
and
that
is
that
this
was
one
of
the
cases
that
justice
jackson
would
have
said
fell
within
the
category
three;
that
is
where
he
had
acted
against
the
will
of
congress
and
in
our
view,
this
is
either
a
category
two
or
a
category
one
case,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
has
acted
with
power
of
something
more
than
just
his
own
article
ii
power,
but
that
in
any
event
his
article
ii
power
would
have
been
sufficient.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
submit
that
on
those
rare
occasions
when
a
crisis
such
as
that
that
occurred
does
occur
and
the
opportunity
for
settlement
occurs,
then
someone
has
to
have
the
power
to
act.
that
is
what
the
president
did
in
this
case.
fortunately,
he
acted
with
the
authority
of
congress
as
well
as
his
own
behind
him.
the
other
issues
concerning
possible
taking
are
completely
separate,
but
what
he
did
in
connection
with
the
settlement
of
claims,
the
nullification
of
attachments,
and
the
transfer
of
assets,
fell
well
within
his
powers,
both
as
supported
by
congress
and
also
under
article
ii.
