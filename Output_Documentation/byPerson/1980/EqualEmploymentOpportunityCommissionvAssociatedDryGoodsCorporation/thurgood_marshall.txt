now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
you
don't
have
full
disclosure
in
a
conciliatory
matter?
how
can
it
be
conciliatory
without
full
disclosure?
how
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
full
disclosure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
that
prompt
people
to
give
it?
justice

marshall
suppose
you're
representing
a
business
firm,
and
they
negotiate...
the
people
on
the
eeoc
say,
we
have
information
that
you
are
charged
with
discriminating
against
three
female
employees.
and
them
saying,
we
now
have
a
charge;
but,
we
have
admissions
from
your
staff
that
that
is
true.
well,
wouldn't
the
second
one
persuade
you
faster
than
the
first
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it?
