mr.
kaplan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
question
that
disclosure
would
facilitate
conciliation...
laying
aside
the
strictures
of
the
statute,
whatever
they
may
be?
chief
justice
burger
well,
does
that
amount
to
saying
that
while
litigation
is
conducted
in
a
goldfish
bowl,
conciliation
is
to
be
conducted
some
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
question
of
privacy
or
a
question
of
conciliation
being
conducted
with
full
knowledge
of
all
the
facts?
it
can
be
private
too,
can't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
be
within
the
authority
of
the
commission
acting
under
its
statutory
authority
to
have
a
regulation
that
any
information
disclosed
to
the
charging
party
or
a
complainant
could
not
be
made
public
without
the
approval
of
the
commission?
that
is,
to
have
a
regulation
that
would
implement
section
709(e)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
meet
your
problem,
wouldn't
it?
that
it
would
become
public
and
be
available
to
competitors
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
particular
words
are
you
now
relying
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
"shall
be
unlawful
to
make
public?
"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
specifically
i
gather
that
you
think
the
provision
in
regulation
1601.22
does
not
apply
to
"such
earlier
disclosures
to
charged
employees.
"
et
cetera,
is
beyond
the
authority
of
the
commission
under
709(e)
or
of
706(b)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
709(e),
would
it
not
serve
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
that
is,
to
protect
against
a
general
public
disclosure,
if
the
commission
provided
in
a
rule
or
regulation
that
this
early
disclosure
would
be
on
condition
that
it's
disclosed
only
to
the
party
for
the
purposes
of
conciliation
and
could
not
be
made
public
by
that
person?
would
that
not
carry
out
the
protective
aspects
of
709(e)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
he's
a
member
of
the
public
but
he's
a
member
of
the
public
different
from
all
other
members
of
the
public
in
the
sense
that
he
claims
to
have
a
complaint
and
may
have
a
valid
complaint
that
calls
for
a
remedy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
why
aren't
those
purposes
served
by
disclosure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
very
soon
after
that,
the
information
is
obtainable,
is
it
not,
and
may
be
used
against
them
by
the
charging
party?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sullivan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
saying
that
for
these
years
they
have
been
making
this
early
disclosure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
all
these
years,
they've
been
making
the
early
disclosure
that's
now
prohibited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
no
one
has
been
prosecuted
under
the
statute?
under
709(e)
they
would
be
subject
to
prosecution
if--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
courts
in
79-1068,
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
against
associated
dry
goods
corporation
will
be
announced
by
