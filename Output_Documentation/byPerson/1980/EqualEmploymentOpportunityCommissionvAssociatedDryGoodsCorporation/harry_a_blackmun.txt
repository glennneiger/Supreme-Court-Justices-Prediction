mr.
sullivan,
what
is
the
standard
which
you
are
proposing
to
us
that
should
be
followed
in
the
determination
of
this
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
certainly
you
want
to
cover
the
charging
parties
and
witnesses.
has
the
commission
been
consistent
in
its
approach
to
this
problem
over
the
years?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
initially,
didn't
they
speak
of
authorizing
disclosure
where
appropriate
or
necessary
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
commission's
functions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
is
it
that...
now,
i
get
back
to
my
first
question...
what
are
you
proposing
now
that
is
distinct
from
that
old
approach?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
sometimes
we
run
into
trouble
with
that.
the
new
standard
speaks
of
relief.
is
the
commission
authorized
to
assist
litigants
in
their
quest
for
relief?
