mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
you
is
whether
the
eeoc
special
disclosure
rules
and
regulations
conflict
with
section
709(e)
of
title
vii
and
foster
litigation
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
the
answer,
we
believe,
lies--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
i
believe
that
if
they
do
conflict
with
section
709(e),
yes--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--it
is
not
to
disclose.
the
answer,
we
think,
lies
in
the
rationale
for
the
rules
as
stated
in
the
rules
themselves.
a
reading
of
section
709
which
gives
proper
scope
to
the
text
and
purpose
of
the
act,
and
a
rule
prescribed
by
congress
for
this
agency
is
not
an
answer
which
is
found
in
the
eeoc
briefs
in
this
case.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
start
by
looking
at
the
statute
and
then
consider
the
rules,
and
then
examine
why
the
rules
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
statutory
provision.
709(e)
prohibits
any
officer
or
employee
of
the
commission
from
making
public
in
any
manner
whatever
any
information
obtained
by
the
commission
pursuant
to
its
investigative
authority
prior
to
suit.
in
our
view
this
language
is
clear
and
sweeping,
and
does
not
not
admit
of
exceptions.
public
disclosure
of
any
sort
is
banned.
the
commission,
though,
seeks
to
avoid
the
ban
by
carving
out
a
rather
large
exception
for
charging
parties
and
others,
saying
that
they
are
not
members
of
the
public,
except
that
its
own
rules
belie
this
intention.
first
of
all,
the
rules
state
who
can
see
investigative
files.
most
simply,
they
allow
a
charging
party,
after
180
days,
to
see
his
investigative
file.
but
the
charging
party,
and
his
lawyer
if
that
may
be
the
case,
aren't
the
only
ones
who
can
see
files.
aggrieved
persons
can
see
their
files.
those
filing
on
behalf
of
aggrieved
persons
can
see
the
files.
representatives
of
eeoc-funded
groups,
such
as
the
mexican-american
legal
defense
and
education
fund,
can
see
the
files
for
the
purpose
of
referring
cases
to
private
counsel
for
litigation.
finally,
the
commission
argues
that
witnesses
to
title
vii
proceedings
may
see
the
files.
what
they
can
see,
of
course,
further
expands
the
scope
of
disclosure.
a
charging
party
may
see
his
own
file,
to
be
sure.
but
he
may
also
see
related
files.
these
are
files
that
according
to
the
commission
allege
a
similar
base
of
discrimination
against
the
same
employer.
for
example,
someone
that's
alleging
national
origin
discrimination
in
one
plant,
let's
say
it's
a
clerical
employee,
that
person
may
examine
the
file
of
another
national
origin
claimant
for
the
same
employer
in
a
different
plant,
maybe
even
in
a
different
state,
working
as
a
factory
mechanic.
they
may
even
see
unrelated
files
where
in
the
commission's
view
the
treatment
accorded
one
group
is
probative
of
the
treatment
accorded
the
charging
party.
the
disclosure
thus
authorized
by
these
rules
can
grow
to
vast
proportions
when
we're
dealing
with
a
sizeable
company
employing
many
employees.
now,
what
is
worse,
i
think,
is
the
unauthorized
disclosures.
once
these
people
obtain
the
information
in
these
files,
they
can
give
the
contents
to
anyone
they
please.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
suggests
that
the
eeoc
says
it
cannot
prevent
this
secondary
disclosure,
can
only
ask
the
recipients
not
to
give
it
out.
we
think
that
the
commission
knows
better.
we
think
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
709(e)
bars
publication
to
the
charging
party
in
the
first
place,
and
that
eliminates
the
problem
of
the
secondary
disclosures.
thus,
in
our
view,
really,
this
court
need
not
reach
the
precise
issue
of
whether
a
particular
charging
party
is
a
member
of
the
public
with
respect
to
his
own
file,
because
clearly
the
totality
of
the
rules
which
are
sought
to
be
enforced
here
authorize
disclosure
to
the
public.
now
even
if
the
court,
though,
reaches
the
narrow
question,
we
think
that
the
results
should
be
the
same,
that
the
rule
should
be
rejected.
the
eeoc's
contention
seems
to
be
grounded
on
an
analogy
between
section
706
and
709.
they
say
that
since
disclosure
is
contemplated
between
the
parties
under
706,
the
same
contemplation
should
be
followed
with
respect
to
709.
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
the
different
congressional
concerns
that
lay
behind
these
statutes,
these
two
sections.
706
deals
with
charges
in
conciliation
information.
now,
it
seems
elementary
to
me
that
these
types
of
information
have
to
be
communicated
as
between
the
originator
and
the
charged
party
or
vice
versa.
certainly
someone
who's
being
accused
of
a
violation
of
title
vii
is
entitled
to
know
that
he's
being
accused
of
that
violation.
this
gives
the
agency
jurisdiction;
gives
the
respondent
notice.
it
justifies
the
intrusion
of
this
government
agency
on
the
private
affairs
of
a
corporation
and
its
employees.
i
think
it
smacks
of
due
process.
conciliation
is
also
in
a
sense
a
fancy
word
for
negotiating
an
agreement.
in
order
to
reach
a
meeting
of
the
minds
there
obviously
has
to
be
communication
on
a
two-way
street,
and
i
think
congress
recognized
this,
so
that
there
is
some
contemplated
disclosure
under
706
as
between
the
parties
to
a
proceeding.
but
what
about
709?
709
deals
with
investigations.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
elements
that
i
was
about
to
address.
there
is
a
question
of
volition
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
it...
not
the
disclosure
advocated
by
my
brother,
but
the
disclosure
which
the
charging
party
or
the
respondent
wishes
to
have
communicated
to
the
other
side.
it
is
a
question
of
negotiating
an
agreement
and
what
that
person
thinks
is
to
his
best
advantage
in
achieving
a
negotiated
settlement.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
yes,
i
do
believe
that
conciliation
must
be
conducted
privately
in
order
to
give
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
consider
various
proposals
and
weigh
them
without
the
pressure
of
public
view
on
what
they
are
doing.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
it
can
be...
well,
it
should
be
conducted
in
private,
yes.
but
the
question,
the
objective
in
a
conciliation
is
remedy.
how
shall
we
achieve
equal
employment
opportunity
and
overcome
whatever
discrimination
has
been
found?
and
i
think
that's
a
significant
consideration,
because
under
the
statutory
scheme
conciliation
occurs
after
the
commission
has
made
a
determination
of
reasonable
cause.
the
issue
of
liability
for
administrative
purposes
has
thus
been
resolved,
and
since
that
determination
also
under
the
commissions's
policy
authorizes
suit
by
the
commission
should
it
desire
to
do
so,
there
is
a
sufficient
clout
to
impel
a
respondent
to
try
to
reach
agreement
before
any
legal
action
is
taken.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary
for
a
conciliation
agreement
to
reexamine
the
whole
investigatory
record
as
the
commission
would
have
it
under
these
rules.
it
is
sufficient
that
appropriate
information
be
exchanged
to
enable
the
parties
to
reach
appropriate
settlement.
the
determination
can
determine
the
extent
of
liability.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
i
think
it's
quite
possible,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
the
disclosure
that
is
needed
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
reaching
agreement.
not
all
the
disclosure--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--no,
i
don't
believe
that's
absolutely
necessary,
not
to
the
extent
of
disclosing
particular
documents
in
the
investigative
file,
the
nitty-gritty
of
the
investigation
conducted
by
the
commission.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
pardon
me?
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
well,
if
they
are--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
your
honor
is
talking
now
about
disclosure
to
the
person
whose
agents
have
contributed
to...
have
made
these
statements.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
commission
cannot
show
a
charging
party
who
has
given
a
statement
a
copy
of
his
own
statement.
that
i
don't
think
is
really
the
issue
here.
nor
am
i
suggesting
that
the
employers
can't
call
up
the
commission
and
say,
listen,
we
gave
you
a
seniority
roster
the
other
day.
i'd
like
to
have
a
copy;
i
forgot
to
make
one.
these
originated
with
the
parties
themselves,
so
i
don't
see
a
problem
in
that
sort
of
disclosure.
it's
the
communication
of
the
basic
investigative
data
to
the
other
side.
and
in
response
to
the
question,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
get
into
that
sort
of
detail
in
executing
agreement.
i
mean,
if
this
is
what
the
commission
is
telling
the
employer...
listen,
we've
got
the
goods
on
you,
and
if
we
have
to
go
to
the
suit
on
this,
we're
going
to
make
it
stick...
well,
i
think
that's,
you
know,
that's
fine.
they
can
make
that
sort
of
representation
to
the
employer
who
gave
that
information.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
to
the
extent
that
it--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--well,
i
don't
think
a
regulation
that
simply
tracks
the
language
of
the
statute
is
particularly
necessary.
i
certainly,
you
know,
wouldn't
personally
have
an
objection
to
that
sort
of
regulation.
but
i
do
think
when
this
regulation
goes
beyond
the
statute
and
starts
in
fact
legislating,
as
we
perceive
this
regulation
to
be
doing,
then
i
think
the
commission
has
gone
too
far
and
has
exceeded
its
statutory
mandate.
i
think
the
statute
is
pretty
clear
on
its
face
and
doesn't
need
particular
elaborations.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i'm
referring,
your
honor,
to
the--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--i'm
concerned
with
the
disclosure
prior
to
the
filing
of
any
proceeding
under
the
title.
i
think
that's
where
we
are...
the
thrust
in
this
case
is
directed.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
is
sufficient
to
implement
the
policies
that
congress
intended
to
include
in
here.
so
i
don't
believe
that
there's
an
additional
regulation
that
is
essential
here.
i
hope
i
haven't--
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
--yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
have
that
right
to
carve
out
the
exception.
there
has
been
no
delegation
by
congress
for
them
to
tamper
with
the
statute
in
that
regard.
what
they
have
done,
if
i
just
may
continue
one
second,
it
seems
to
me,
is
carve
out
an
exception
and
then
legislate
within
it.
and
i
think
that's
where
they're
at
fault.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
i
think
that
ultimately
the
charging
party
is
in
fact
a
member
of
the
public
and
so
that
even
the
disclosure
to
him
is
improper.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
he
may,
he
may
not.
it's
a
judgment,
though,
i
think,
that
congress
has
made
in
terms
of
what
rights
this
person
ought
to
have
and
it
has
given
him
rather
substantial
rights.
however,
it
has
drawn
a
line
at
one
place,
and
the
line
it
has
drawn
is
the
filing
of
an
action,
as
we
read
this
statute.
and
thus
to
give
him
this
disclosure
before
that
occurs
is
simply
not
what
congress
intended.
if
the
eeoc
has
problems
with
this
statute...
and
from
what,
the
comments
of
my
learned
opponent,
he
seems
to
suggest
that
they
have,
in
terms
of
administering
the
statute...
the
remedy
does
not
lie
to
my
mind
in
cutting
statutory
corners
or,
indeed,
in
asking
the
courts
to
approve
this
kind
of
shorthand
approach.
rather,
it
lies
in
going
back
to
congress
and
saying,
we
can't
function
under
the
rules
that
you've
given
us;
do
something
else.
and
if
they
can
persuade
them,
fine.
if
they
can't,
they
will
have
to
just
live
with
the
situation
as
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
charging
party,
though,
as
the
eeoc
has
made
clear,
in
fact
is
an
agent
of
disclosure
which
is
going
to
result
in
a
general
dissemination
of
information,
and
in
fact
he
receives
information
from
a
variety
of
sources,
even
looking
at
his
own
file,
because
there
is
commingling
or
consolidation
which
occurs
in
these
cases.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
that
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
statute
which
call
attention
to
the
distinct,
intense,
"had".
i
think
reference
was
had
earlier
to
the
volitional
element
which
i
touched
upon.
certainly
no
one
compels
a
party
to
file
a
charge
or
engage
in
conciliation.
as
counsel
has
mentioned,
there
is
some
compulsory
element
in
terms
of
investigative
information,
and
congress
might
properly
take
consideration
of
that
in
imposing
a
stricter
limitation
on
the
use
of
that
information.
that
might
be
the
case
with
706-type
information.
the
duration
of
the
ban
on
disclosure
also
suggests
different
purposes.
conciliation
information
which
is
traditional
settlement
type
of
information
is
put
on
a
permanent
ban.
it
cannot
be
used
in
litigation
later
on.
i
think
this
conforms
to
general
understanding
on
settlement
information
throughout
the
law.
on
the
other
hand,
investigative
data
which
congress
recognized
might
be
of
use
to
the
charging
party,
or
indeed,
essential
in
this
title
vii
suit,
is
made
available
once
he
files
his
action.
i
don't
think
it's
too
much
to
ask,
or
that
it
was
arbitrary
of
congress
to
impose
the
requirement
at
the
filing
of
suit.
finally,
i
would
like
to
just
address
briefly
some
of
the
considerations
of
the
eeoc
in
trying
to
justify
this
rule.
they
say
that
these
rules
help
their
investigation
or
their
conciliation.
i
think
the
statements
in
the
rules
themselves
contain
the
negation
of
that
argument.
"the
stated
purpose
of
these
rules
is
to
cooperate
with
private
title
vii
litigants
and
to
lend
assistance
in
framing
proper
court
complaints.
"
i
think
that's
as
clear
as
can
be.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
investigation,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
conciliation,
it
has
to
do
with
litigation.
if
that
isn't
clear
enough,
i
think
the
reference
to
kessler
in
the
eeoc
special
disclosure
rules
furthers
that
conclusion.
"the
charging
party
literally
needs
all
the
help
he
can
get.
"
said
the
court
in
kessler,
in
order
to
procure
counsel,
convince
him
that
a
right
to
action
truly
exists
with
evidence
to
support
it,
and
to
prepare
and
file
suit
within
the
statutory
time
period.
this
goes
to
litigation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
investigation
or
conciliatory
functions.
in
fact,
if
it
were
investigation
that
the
commission
were
concerned
with,
why
does
it
put
a
bar
on
the
disclosure
to
employers,
of
the
information
in
these
files?
and
yet
that
prohibition
is
in
the
special
disclosure
rules.
obviously,
it's
not
concerned
with
having
employers
verify
the
statements
of
the
complainants.
in
short,
i
really
think
these
rules
are
going
to
harm
these
processes.
as
in
this
case,
the
employer
knows
this
information
is
going
to
be
turned
over
to
his
probable
adversary.
he's
not
going
to
be
willing
to
turn
over
vast
amounts
of
employment
data.
rather,
what
will
probably
happen
is
he'll
sit
back,
wait
for
subpoena
enforcement
proceedings,
and
then
in
the
context
of
those
proceedings
seek
to
get
a
protective
order
which
he
probably
was
entitled
to
under
the
statute
in
the
first
place.
now,
will
the
commission
get
its
data
eventually
through
these
court
proceedings?
in
most
cases
i
suspect
it
will;
the
definition
of
relevancy
in
investigations
is
quite
broad.
but
in
the
meantime,
what
happens?
there
are
long
delays,
there
is
needless
expense,
there
is
needless
acrimony
developed
in
terms
of
the
administration,
and
meanwhile
the
charging
party
gets
frustrated,
says,
this
government
agency
is
no
better
than
any
other
i've
dealt
with,
retains
a
private
lawyer
and
files
suit.
now,
that's
not
what
congress
wanted
in
title
vii.
it
wanted
the
peaceful
resolution
of
title
vii
complaints
through
the
agency's
own
processes,
investigation,
determination,
conciliation,
cooperation,
conference,
and
persuasion.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
because,
your
honor,
the
effect
of
the
disclosures
will
be
to
impede
the
submission
of
the
information
to
the
commission
in
the
first
place
from
the
person
who
has
it,
the
employer.
because
he's
going
to
be
concerned,
as
associated
and
horne's
were
in
this
case,
that
that
information
is
going
to
be
turned
around
and
used
against
them
in
a
lawsuit
by
that
charging
party.
and
let
us
remember,
it
is
primarily
the
function
of
the
commission
to
enforce
the
law.
mr.
roger
s.
kaplan
after
suit
is
filed,
your
honor,
it
may
be
obtained
and
used.
but
this
is
again,
as
i
pointed
out,
is
essentially
a
congressional
decision.
there
are
lines
drawn.
it
sometimes
may
seem
a
little
arbitrary,
i
suppose,
to
the
charging
party,
saying,
i
can't
get
it
on
the
179th
day
because
that
time
limit
hasn't
expired
but
on
day
181
all
i
have
to
do
is
march
into
the
commission
office
with
a
complaint
saying
u.
s.
district
court>
["],
and
i
can
get
the
information.
but
also,
there
is
the
fact
that
the
employer
can
get
protection
through
the
courts
by
taking
a
hard
line,
essentially,
in
these
proceedings,
because
he
knows
he's
not
going
to
get
the
protection
from
the
commission.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
this
type
of
turnover
facilitates
the
resolution
of
title
vii
complaints
in
the
manner
that
congress
intended.
finally,
i
think
that
the
section-by-section
analysis
of
title
vii
provides...
further
supports
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
want
this
kind
of
disclosure.
it
states
pretty
clearly
that
recourse
to
the
private
lawsuit
will
be
the
exception
and
not
the
rule,
and
that
the
vast
majority
of
complaints
will
be
handled
through
the
offices
of
the
eeoc.
so...
true...
congress
gave
the
eeoc
additional
some
additional
authority
in
1972
to
put
some
teeth
into
the
statute.
but
its
essential,
overriding
purpose
remains
the
same.
it
wanted
the
commission
to
resolve
these
complaints
to
the
extent
possible
through
its
own
offices
rather
than
through
private
litigation.
and
the
reason
is
quite
clear.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
some
of
its
earlier
decisions,
the
commission
is
a
public
agency
acting
in
the
public
interest.
it
is
not
fundamentally
concerned
with
the
private
interest
of
the
private
litigant
and
his
narrow
concerns.
it
is
trying
to
achieve
overall
compliance
with
the
law.
and
it
is
important
to
further
that
interest.
the
rules
are
not
calculated
to
do
that.
they
are
calculated
to
short
circuit
the
statutory
process,
force
complainants
out
of
the
administrative
process
and
into
private
lawsuits,
and
impede
the
functions
of
the
commission
as
congress
intended
them.
for
those
reasons
we
ask
that
you
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
