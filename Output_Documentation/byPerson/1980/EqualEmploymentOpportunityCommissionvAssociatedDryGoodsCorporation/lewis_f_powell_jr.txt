justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
sullivan,
would
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
20
and
help
me
a
bit
with
the
facts.
perhaps
you'd
better
look
first
at
page
19,
which
is
an
exhibit
to
the
complaint?
the
interrogatory?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
they
the
interrogatories
filed
by
the
commission?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
looking
for
the
moment
at
the
original
ones,
how
many
stores
did
those
questions
implicate?
it
says,
list
the
number
of
stores.
then,
for
each
attach
a
roster
of
each
store
having
a
tea
room
and
food
service.
and
then
dropping
on
down
to
17,
a
roster
of
all
food
service
personnel.
i
think
that
goes
back
either
to
'71
or
'69,
with
personnel
information
on
each.
and
then
in
19,
it
requires
a
very
extensive
disclosure,
apparently
of
a
host
of
people
who
weren't
involved
in
any
way
as
charging
parties.
is
that
correct?
and
are
we
talking
about
hundreds
of
people,
or
dozens,
or
thousands,
or
what?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
there
were
two
or
three
thousand
people
they
wanted
the
records
of?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
the
information
that
would
be
sought
and
ultimately,
perhaps,
reach
the
public
included
just
the
charging
parties
and
with
whom
they
worked,
or
perhaps
several
hundred
or
several
thousand
other
employees?
