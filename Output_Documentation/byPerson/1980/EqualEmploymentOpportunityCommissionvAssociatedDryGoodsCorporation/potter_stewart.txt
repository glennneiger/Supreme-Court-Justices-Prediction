justice
stewart
the
court
primarily
held
it
violated
709(e),
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
that's
certainly
the
statutory
provision
upon
which
respondent
primarily
relies.
justice
stewart
so
that
you
don't
really
accurately
state
the
question,
that
the
question
is
a
709(e)
question,
not
a
706(b)
and
709(e)
question.
justice
stewart
you're
talking
about
judge
winters'
opinion?
justice
stewart
in
every
case?
in
other
words,
mr.
sullivan,
is
it
your
submission
that
the
provisions
of
the
present
regulation,
1601.22,
allows
the
commission
to
disclose
before
legal
action
any
of
this
information
to
charging
parties
or
their
attorneys,
respondents
or
their
attorneys,
but
to
witnesses
only
where
disclosure
is
deemed
necessary
for
securing
appropriate
relief?
do
you
think
the
"where"
modifies
only
"witnesses"?
justice
stewart
because
of
the
lack
of
a
comma
after
the
word
witnesses?
justice
stewart
well,
709(e)
is
a
criminal
statute.
justice
stewart
and
it
doesn't
provide
any
defense,
even
if
it's
done
with
consent
of
one
or
more
of
the
interested
parties.
justice
stewart
well,
really,
if
we
find
they
conflict
with
709(e)
of
title
vii,
that's
the
end
of
our
inquiry,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
whether
or
not
they
foster
litigation,
whether
or
not
709(e)
is
wise
or
unwise,
is
none
of
our
business,
is
it?
justice
stewart
if
709(e)
is
part
of
what
your
brother
simply
just
called
the
statutory
mandate
of
the
commission,
then
that
is
its
mandate,
not
to
disclose.
justice
stewart
--there
are
two
or
three.
there's
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
isn't
there,
which
says
that
the
regulation
is
contrary
to
709(e).
justice
stewart
if
the
law
is
against
the
commission,
why
would
anybody
need
to
go
any
further?
justice
stewart
so
once
you
do
it
once
successfully
that's
the
end
of
it;
that's
what
the
law
is
in
that
circuit.
justice
stewart
apparently
the
commission
didn't
know,
because
it
asked
the
employer
to
list
the
number
of
stores
the
respondent
has
in
western
pennsylvania.
justice
stewart
so
we
don't
know--
justice
stewart
--the
answer.
and
we
don't
know
how
many
people
there
are.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
title
vii
of
the
civic
rights
act
of
1964
limits
the
authority
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
to
make
public
disclosure
of
information
it
has
obtained
in
investigating
and
attempting
to
resolve
a
claim
of
employment
discrimination.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
a
prelitigation
disclosure
of
information
in
a
commission
file
to
the
employee
who
filed
the
title
vii
claim
is
a
"public"
disclosure
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
restrictions.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
