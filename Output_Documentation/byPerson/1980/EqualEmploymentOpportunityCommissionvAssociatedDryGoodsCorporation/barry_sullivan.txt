mr.
barry
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
a
narrow
but
important
question
of
statutory
construction
regarding
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
question
is
whether
section
706(b)
and
709(e)
of
title
vii
which
prohibit
the
commission
from
disclosing
investigatory
information
to
the
public
prior
to
the
filing
of
a
suit
prohibit
disclosures
of
such
information
to
persons
immediately
involved
in
commission
proceedings.
this
is
a
narrow
question
in
two
senses.
first,
the
textual
question
is
a
narrow
one,
whether
the
words
of
the
statute,
"making
public",
includes
persons
who
are
immediately
involved
in
administrative
proceedings.
secondly,
in
context,
in
section
709(e)
of
the
statute,
it
is
clear
that
the
prohibition
on
making
public
this
information
applies
only
to
prelitigation
disclosure,
to
disclosures
that
are
made
prior
to
the
time
that
the
title
vii
action
is
brought.
therefore,
the
question
is
not
whether
disclosures
of
information
may
occur,
even
to
the
public,
but
the
timing
of
those
disclosures.
the
question
is
an
important
question
for
purposes
of
the
administration
of
title
vii,
because
the
answer
to
the
question,
whether
the
charging
parties
and
attorneys
and
respondents
and
material
witnesses
are
members
of
the
public
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
will
impact
on
the
commission's
administration
of
the
statute
in
investigation,
conciliation,
and
reasonable
cause
determination,
virtually
at
every
stage
of
the
commission's
processing
of
charges
of
employment
discrimination.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated.
in
november,
1971,
and
continuing
through
june,
1973,
seven
charges
of
employment
discrimination
were
filed
with
the
commission
against
the
joseph
horne
company,
a
pittsburgh
retailer,
and
the
subsidiary
of
respondent,
associated
dry
goods.
these
charges
alleged
discrimination...
these
charges
were
filed
by
seven
women.
in
six
of
the
cases
sex
discrimination
was
charged.
in
the
seventh
charge,
which
was
also
filed
by
a
woman,
racial
discrimination
was
charged.
three
of
the
charges
also
charged
retaliation.
in
february,
1974,
the
commission
began
its
investigation
by
asking
the
joseph
horne
company
to
produce
certain
evidence
that
the
commission
thought
relevant
to
these
charges.
basically,
the
evidence
that
was
requested
was
information
pertaining
to
the
company's
personnel
practices
and
employment
files
and
other
information
relating
to
the
departments
of
the
employer
in
which
these
seven
charging
parties
were
employed.
horne
declined
the
commission's
request
for
this
information
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
would
not
guarantee
at
that
point
that
information
thus
collected
would
not
be
disclosed
to
charging
parties
or
their
attorneys
or
to
witnesses
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
thereafter,
negotiations
followed.
they
were
eventually
unsuccessful.
the
commission
in
october,
1974,
issued
an
administrative
subpoena
for
purposes
of
acquiring
much
the
same
information.
in
june,
1975,
associated
brought
this
action
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
asserting
that
the
commission's
disclosure
policies
violated
sections
706(b)
and
709(e).
subsequently
the
commission
brought
an
action
itself
to
enforce
its
subpoena
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
the
two
suits
were
subsequently
consolidated
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia;
the
district
court
enforced
subpoena,
but
held
that
disclosure
to
the
parties
and
to
attorneys
would
do
violence
to
the
statutory
scheme
because
it
would
affect
conciliation
and
settlement,
and
therefore
held
that
the
parties
were
included
within
the
public
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
in
october,
1979,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
by
divided
vote.
the
question
the
court
of
appeals
determined
was
whether
disclosure
to
charging
parties
and
attorneys
prior
to
suit
violates
section
706(b)
and
709(e).
the
court
held
that
it
did.
judge
hall
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
believe,
mr.
justice--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
recognize
that
is
what
respondent
asserts,
mr.
justice.
however,
the
text
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
quite
clear
in
relying
on
both
of
the
sections.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
that
would
be
correct
although
i
don't
think
that
the
4th
circuit
was
correct
on
either
one.
mr.
barry
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
judge
hall
dissented
noting
that
the
decision
of
the
majority
was
not
based
on
statutory
construction,
but
was
based
on
policy
ground,
namely,
the
fear
that
disclosure
to
charging
parties
and
their
attorneys
would
contribute
to
litigation.
the
judge
also
noted
that
the
practical
effect
of
the
decision
was
to
require
charging
parties
to
file
lawsuits
in
order
to
determine
whether
their
charges
had
any
merit,
and
that
the
practical
effect
was
simply
to
delay
disclosure
to
the
parties,
not
to
deny
disclosure.
i
should
also
note,
however,
that
in
one
respect
judge
hall
did
not
agree
with
the
commission
in
that
judge
hall
believed
that
disclosure
of
materials
in
related
case
files
which
the
commission
believes
is
appropriate
was
not
valid.
the
decision
of
the
4th
circuit
simply
does
not
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
that's
presented
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
charging
parties
and
attorneys
were
members
of
the
public,
but
at
the
same
time
the
court
found
that
certain
disclosures
could
be
made
to
the
parties
during
the
administrative
process.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
information
could
not
be
disseminated
to
the
parties
in
haec
verba
but
that
the
commission
could
say
to
the
parties,
it
has
been
reported
that,
or
it
has
been
said
that,
and
then
effectively
convey
the
information
that
was
contained
in
the
file.
we
believe
that
does
not
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
that's
presented
in
this
case
because
section
709(e)
prevents
disclosure
to
the
public
in
any
manner
whatever.
the
solution
of
the
4th
circuit,
while
it
may
be
an
appropriate
solution
in
some
respects,
is
not
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
statutory
construction
that's
presented
in
this
case.
the
real
question
that
has
to
be
decided
with
respect
to
section
709(e)
and
with
respect
to
section
706(b)
is
whether
the
phrase,
"making
public"
is
meant
to
include
persons
who
are
directly
involved
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
moreover,
we
submit
that
the
4th
circuit's
construction
of
the
statute,
the
definition
of
"making
public"
which
was
accepted
by
the
courts
below,
is
erroneous
in
any
event.
although
706(b)
and
709(e)
are
read
together
as
they
must
be,
and
in
light
of
legislative
history,
that
the
prohibition
of
public
disclosure
means
the
prohibition
of
disclosing
information
to
the
general
public.
as
senator
humphrey
said
in
the
legislative
debates,
this
is
a
ban
on
publicizing.
however,
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
even
more
clear
when
these
provisions
are
read
against
the
statute
as
a
whole.
the
commission
has
the
duty
to
investigate
and
to
determine
reasonable
cause,
and
to
attempt
to
settle
disputes
through
informal
means
of
conciliation,
conference,
and
persuasion.
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
commission
to
successfully
and
effectively
undertake
and
complete
these
statutory
duties
if
they
could
not
disclose
material
to
charging
parties
and
to
material
witnesses
when
necessary.
it
is
particularly
obvious
in
the
investigation
stage
when
the
commission
is
presented
with
a
charge
of
discrimination
which
it
must
attempt
to
investigate
in
order
to
determine
whether
reasonable
cause
exists
to
believe
that
a
violation
of
the
statute
occurred.
the
respondent
here
asserts
that
nondisclosure
to
the
parties
would
forward
the
investigation
because
respondents
or
employers
would
be
more
likely
to
come
forward
with
information.
while
that
may
be
true,
two
points
must
be
made:
the
commission
has
compulsory
process
and
can
enforce
its
subpoenas
in
court,
so
essentially
the
respondent
is
saying
that
employers
will
come
forward
with
the
information
that
they're
required
by
statutes
to
come
forward
with
in
any
event.
secondly,
even
if
the
information
were
produced
by
employers
more
freely,
the
difficulty
is
that
all
of
the
information
that
they
might
provide
simply
would
not
advance
the
investigation
if
that
material
could
not
be
tested
during
the
investigation.
the
investigation
requires
more
than
the
receipt
of
one-sided
information.
it
requires
the
commission
to
go
out
and
try
to
verify
that
information
and
determine
its
truth.
with
respect
to
the
reasonable
cause
determination
the
same
principles
apply.
the
quality
of
that
determination
can
be
no
greater
than
the
quality
of
the
investigations
which
led
to
it.
mr.
barry
sullivan
mr.
justice,
i
believe--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--yes,
it
has,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
commission
first
formulated
regulations
to
deal
with
this
problem
in
1965
and
with
very
minor
changes
those
regulations
have
been
in
effect
since
then.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
don't
think
that
it's
distinct
at
all.
the
language
that
is
now
in
the
regulation
is
slightly
different
in
that
it
says,
"where
disclosure
is
deemed
necessary
for
securing
appropriate
relief.
"
when
that
change
was
made,
when
it
was
published
in
the
federal
register,
it
was
published
with
the
notation
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
don't
believe
that...
that
question
is
not
easy
to
answer,
mr.
justice.
the
commission
in
terms
is
authorized
to
cooperate
with
individuals.
that
authorization
occurs
in
section
2000(e)(4)(g)
of
the
enumeration
of
the
commission's
powers.
however,
i
wouldn't
rely
on
that
exclusively.
as
you
are
aware,
the
commission
has
the
right
to
bring
a
civil
complaint
itself
in
meritorious
cases.
and
if
the
commission
had
sufficient
resources
it
could
obviously
bring
a
civil
action
in
every
case
that
was
brought
before
it
in
which
the
charging
parties'
charge
was
deemed
to
have
sufficient
merit
to
go
forward.
however,
it
can't
do
that
because
it
doesn't
have
the
administrative
resources
to
do
it,
and
therefore
the
commission's
enforcement
of
title
vii
depends
in
large
part
on
private
actions
being
brought.
if
an
action
were
being
brought
by
the
commission
itself
in
a
title
vii
case,
clearly
the
investigative
files
that
were
in
its
possession
would
be
things
that
the
commission
could
use
in
framing
the
complaint.
and
if
the
charging
party
is
acting
effectively
as
a
private
attorney
general,
i
think
that
it's
implicit
in
the
statutory
framework
that
that
person
should
also
have
access
to
the
materials.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
that's
correct.
that
would
be
consistent
with
my
understanding.
i
think
that
it's
important--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--yes.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
understand
that
there
are
really
two
kinds
of
disclosures
that
go
on
during
the
course
of
the
administrative
process.
one
is
the
kind
of
disclosure
that
goes
on
during
conciliation
or
investigation,
and
those
are
by
and
large
limited
disclosures
in
which
the
commission
is
trying
to
investigate
and
conciliate
the
charge,
and
in
effect
is
filtering
the
information
to
the
parties
as
it
deems
necessary
to
forward
those
goals.
however,
the
commission
also
gives
the
charging
party
in
effect
a
last
clear
chance
in
prelitigation
disclosure
to
see
what's
in
the
case
file
in
order
to
make
a
determined
and
reasoned
decision
as
to
whether
to
go
forward
with
the
case.
and
when
the
attorney
who's
representing
the
charging
party
at
that
point
is
able
to
make
that
determination,
the
commission
believes
that
the
overall
purposes
of
title
vii
are
well
served,
because
the
attorney
is
more
likely
to
persuade
the
charging
party
at
that
point
that
a
meritorious
case
isn't
worth
bringing,
and
also
that
a
meritorious
case
is
worth
bringing.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
suppose
that
is
a
twist.
mr.
barry
sullivan
assuming
that
what
was
in
the
file
left
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
the
case
had
no
merit.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
that's
possible.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable...
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
construe
the
statute
as
requiring
that,
and
i
also
don't
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
effectively
delegate
its
authority
to
show
files
to
respondents,
because
i
think
that
might
cause
problems
in
more
cases
than
it
would
ease,
so
i--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
of
course
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
charging
party
in
those
circumstances,
if
that
were
the
construction
of
the
statute,
to
know
whether
it
was
being
given
all
of
the
material
that
was
actually
in
the
investigative
file.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
true.
i
think
that
it's
very
important
to
emphasize
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
simply
the
way
in
which
the
commission
has
chosen
to
structure
its
investigations
or
to
structure
its
administrative
processes.
but
what
is
at
issue
is
the
very
ability
of
the
commission
to
effectively
fulfill
its
statutory
mandate.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
will
be
brief,
your
honor.
i
would
like
first
to
comment
on
the
possibility
of
a
flood
of
litigation
that
will
arise
from
the
court's
upholding
of
the
commission's
construction
of
the
statute.
what
i
think
is
remarkable
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
been
enforcing
its
understanding
of
the
statute
according
to
these
regulations
for
the
last
16
years,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
very,
very
few
suits
have
been
brought
to
resist
the
commission's
understanding
of
the
statute.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
true,
and--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--to
my
knowledge
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
under
the
statute.
however,
there
has
also
been
no
flood
of
employer
litigation
going
into
court
to
try
to
stop
the
commission
from
enforcing
the
statute
in
this
way.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
case--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
that...
there
are
three
cases,
your
honor.
there
are
two
cases
which
are
against
the
commission
on
defense
on
grounds
that
are
not
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
barry
sullivan
and
in
the
5th
circuit
the
law
is
to
the
contrary.
however,
those...
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
7th
circuit
in
burlington
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
are
cases
that,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
distinguishable,
and
do
not
in
any
way
relate
to
the
precise
issue
that's
involved
here,
those
cases
involved
commissioner
charges.
they
did
not
involve
single
employee
charges.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
don't
believe
it
has,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
we
have,
we
will
concede
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
because
jurisdiction
hasn't
been
briefed,
or
the
cause
of
action
hasn't
been
briefed,
we
will
concede
that
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
probably
under
a
theory
like
chrysler
v.
brown,
relying
on
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
in
general--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
correct.
however,
i
would
assume
that
in
an
appropriate
case
this
issue
could
be
raised,
as
my
opponent
has
said,
in
an
action
that
the
commission
might
bring
to
enforce
a
subpoena.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
barry
sullivan
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
barry
sullivan
this
is
an
attachment
to
the
exhibit
a,
i
believe,
which
is
on
page
17
and
page
18,
and
these
are
the
questions
that
were
initially
asked
by
the
commission
of
joseph
horne.
subsequently
the
questions
were
refined
a
bit
and
as
they
appear
in
the
rider
to
the
subpoena,
they
are
reproduced
at
pages
40
through
42
of
the
appendix.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
haven't
reviewed
the
materials
that
were
actually
produced
in
response
to
the
subpoena
so
i'm
not
certain
of
what
the
answer
actually
is.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
question.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
very
few
stores
that
are
actually
involved,
but
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
we
don't
know.
mr.
barry
sullivan
we
don't
know
how
many
people
there
are.
however,
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
any
title
vii
case
information
has
to
be
acquired
concerning
the
whole
class,
whatever
that
relevant
classification
might
be.
it
might
be
the
members
of
a
particular
department
in
a
department
store
such
as
the
tea
room,
or
it
might
be
several
tea
rooms
might
be
amalgamated
under
one
administration
in
four
stores.
so
that
there's
always
the
necessity
for
going
beyond
the
immediate
facts
that
the
charging
party
has
raised.
thank
you.
