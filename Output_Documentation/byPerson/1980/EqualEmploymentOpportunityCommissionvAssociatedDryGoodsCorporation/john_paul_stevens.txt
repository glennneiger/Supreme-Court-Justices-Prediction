of
course,
for
the
former
alternative,
i
suppose
the
attorney
could
ask
the
respondent
for
authority
to
disclose
the
information
and
ask
the
respondent
directly
to
make
the
disclosure,
couldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
respondent
would
be
motivated
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
or
was
persuasive
in
favor
of
settlement,
which
is
a
hypothesis
that
you're
working
in?
justice
stevens
no,
but
the
hypothesis
is
that
the
company
would
be
persuaded
that
if
the
information
were
disclosed,
then
the
company
could
surely
disclose
it
without
any
violation
of
the
statute
test.
the
restriction
only
operates
against
the
commission,
doesn't
it?
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
commission
could
say,
there
is
more
information
in
the
file.
they
could
say
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
to
prohibit
the
commission
from
telling
the
charging
party
whether
or
not
there's
been
full
disclosure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan,
in
any
of
these
cases
has
the
question
ever
arisen
as
to
whether
the
employer
has
an
implied
private
cause
of
action
under
the
statute
to
institute
litigation
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
government
concede
there
is
such
an
implied--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
true
that
the
exclusive
provision
in
the
statute
relating
to
nondisclosure
is
a
criminal
penalty.
that's...
it
is
using
it
basically.
that's
the
only
prohibition
on
the
remedy
as
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
this
was
both
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
resistance
to
a
subpoena,
wasn't
it?
