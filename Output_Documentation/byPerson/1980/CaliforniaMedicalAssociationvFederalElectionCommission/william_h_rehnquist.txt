justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zimmerman,
i
gather
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
ninth
circuit
as
to
our
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
the
--
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
treatment
of
the
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
was
an
interlay
if
it
--
if
it
were
an
ordinary
case
and
not
an
fec
case,
clearly,
the
question
certified
by
judge
orrick
were
interlocutory
and
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
be
justified
in
simply
resting
its
jurisdiction
on
the
en
banc
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
--
the
majority
didn't
--
didn't
rest
on
--
on
that
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
--
doesn't
the
special
jurisdictional
provision
require
them
to
sit
en
banc
not
pursuant
to
rule
35?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
they
successfully
avoid
it?
look
at
page
826
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
delicate
questions
such
as
the
opposed
here
suggested
are
to
be
decided
only
when
they
sit.
we
think
the
better
course
is
to
let
our
decision
to
hear
the
case
en
banc
rest
on
our
authority
under
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
35.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
read
the
western
pacific
case,
345
u.s.?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
read
the
western
pacific
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
ever
read
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
every
single
dispute
between
the
federal
elections
commission
and
a
potential
contributor
come
up
under
these
jurisdictional
provisions
that
we've
been
discussing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
judge
kennedy's
observation
that
the
--
as
applied/facially
unconstitutional
distinction
is
a
rather
vague
and
metaphysical?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
if
congress
passed
an
amendment
to
the
statute,
next
year
you
would
be
entitled
of
the
same
rapid
fire
consideration
you've
got
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
agree
with
the
underlying
theory
of
the
buckley
decision
or
would
you
agree
that
the
underlying
theory
is
that
money
is
speech?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
presumably,
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
1907
and
the
amendments
to
it
in
the
late
1940's
applying
to
labor
unions
are
unconstitutional
to
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
corporations
persons
under
lease
since
first
national
bank
versus
bellotti?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
western
pacific
also
held
that
there
had
to
be
some
proceeding
for
a
hearing.
in
the
--
in
those
days,
there
just
wasn't
any
hearing
en
banc
in
the
ninth
--
in
the
ninth
circuit.
you
had
your
three-judge
opinion
and
you
had
filed
a
paper
with
the
clerk
asking
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
you
never
heard
anything
more
about
it.
and
this
court
held
that
the
court
was
free
to
establish
any
reasonable
proceedings
as
i
understand
it,
for
granting
or
denying
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
but
that
there
had
to
be
some
proceeding
whereby
the
petition
was
at
least
considered.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
were
we
to
review
the
exercise
of
their
decision
to
sit
en
banc
under
rule
35
because
that
does
lay
down
some
standards
for
a
court
convening
en
banc
under
rule
35,
an
exceptional
case
and
the
hearings
en
banc
are
not
favored
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
that.
i'm
not
sure
that's
responsive
to
your
--
to
your
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
procedurally
then,
you
agree
with
judge
wallace.
