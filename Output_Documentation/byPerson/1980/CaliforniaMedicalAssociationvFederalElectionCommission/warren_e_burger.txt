mr.

think
you

ready.

did
you
see
any
reason
why
congress
can't
tell
any
court
of
appeals
in
the
country
that
they
must
hear
certain
cases
en
banc?
chief
justice

well,
it
might
be
inconvenient,
but
would
it
--
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
chief

e.

under
this
act,
what
is
the
limit
that
each
doctor
involved
in
this
enterprise
may
contribute
to

chief

e.

what
if,
in
that
section
of
the

that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
read
to
you
they
had
said,
“we
are
in
doubt
as
to
the
source
of
our
jurisdiction
here,
so
we
will
consider
ourselves
sitting
under
437h
and
the
--
the
rule,”
both?
any
problem?
chief

and
if
they
have
the
requisite
number
of
people
there,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
are
--
under
which
statute
do
they
say
they're
sitting
any
more
than
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
they
did
or
did
not
wear
their
robes?

this
has
something
--
that
this
has
something
of
--
of
the
reading
of
the
common
law
pleadings
some
centuries
ago.
as
long
as
you'll
have
the
proper
people
there,
i
repeat,
what
difference
does
it
make?
which
statute
they
said
they
were
operating,
they
were
gathered
and
assembled
under?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
a
constitutional
objective
or
proper
constitutional
objective
in
limiting
what
you
call
the
proliferation
of
committees?
chief
justice
warren
e.

do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
