justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
that
--
whatever
problem
there
is
was
avoided.
justice
jr.
how
do
you
see
or
define
the
administrative
support?
justice
jr.
well,
for
example?
justice
jr.
in
any
event,
mr.
steele,
if
in
fact
from
my
understanding
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
and
i
know
you
argued
it.
but
if
it
did,
then
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
their
opinion
that
they
were
sitting
under
35
and
other
than
that
for
437h
would
be
immaterial?
