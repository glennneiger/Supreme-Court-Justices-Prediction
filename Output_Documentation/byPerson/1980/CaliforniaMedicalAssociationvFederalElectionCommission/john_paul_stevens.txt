i'm
not
too
sure
about
your
--
your
immediate
past
statement.
are
you
limiting
your
challenge
to
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
steele,
does
this
bring
you
out
that
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
this
had
to
be
a
437
en
banc
or
not
at
all,
and
that
really
was
a
437
en
banc
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
it
to
be
clear.
you
--
you
would
say
that
it
was
jurisdictional?
