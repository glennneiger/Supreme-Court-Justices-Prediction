mr.
charles
n.
steele
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
matters
here,
the
jurisdictional
matter
and
the
substantive
regulation.
while
i
will
try
and
use
the
majority
of
my
time
to
deal
with
the
substantive
regulation,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
jurisdictional
question
because
it
is
something
that
i
think
has
caused
great
difficult
to
the
courts
of
appeals
below.
the
question
is
really,
one,
i
think
of
--
of
statutory
interpretation
of
the
proper
interpretation
of
2
u.s.c.
437h.
we
urged
upon
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
as
we
have
urged
on
other
circuits
that
that
statute
should
be
narrowly
construed,
that
the
words
in
that
statute
as
may
be
appropriate
to
construe
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
do
not
mean
that
any
question
certified
up
to
the
court
must
be
dealt
with,
with
the
very
extraordinary
provisions
that
437h
provides,
not
only
of
en
banc
hearing
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
then
of
direct
route
--
right
of
appeal
to
this
court
in
--
in
an
error
of
course
when
there
has
been
at
least
in
other
instances
some
indication
of
trying
to
limit
that
kind
of
direct
appeal.
so
we
have
urged
that
there
should
be
a
narrow
interpretation
of
that
--
of
--
of
that
phrase
as
may
be
appropriate
and
that
in
circumstances
such
as
this
case
here,
where
there
was
already
a
proceeding
which
had
commenced
in
front
of
the
commission,
that
it
was
not
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
hear
--
to
hear
that
case.
the
court
of
appeals
took
what
seems
to
have
been
a
middle
course.
they
asked
us,
as
noted
in
the
record,
that
the
parties
addressed
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
that
they
sit
en
banc
and
then,
at
least,
in
our
opinion,
did
not
sit
pursuant
to
437h
because
they
specifically
said
that
they
would
not
follow
the
requirement
set
forth
in
the
statute
that
--
by
congress
--
that
they
be
required
to
sit
en
banc.
there
is
--
i
do
not
want
to
go
through
the
various
cases
that
have
dealt
with
437h
because
they
have
been
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief
and
in
our
opponent's
brief.
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
the
case
that
was
just
recently
decided
last
week
on
january
15th
in
fec
versus
lance,
which
is
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
note
21.
there,
in
a
subpoena,
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
commission
had
brought
an
enforcement
of
some
subpoena
action.
the
subpoena
was
enforced
early
in
1978.
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
that
action
and
stayed
that
action
pending
hearing
on
the
defenses
that
had
been
raised,
including
constitutional
defenses.
a
panel
decision
was
rendering
saying
that
the
subpoena
should
be
enforced,
that
it
did
not
find
the
defenses
acceptable,
but
that
due
to
the
presence
of
437h,
they
felt
that
the
constitutional
defenses
raised
as
a
subpoena
should
be
certified
to
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals,
in
the
decision
that
was
rendered
last
week,
following
the
ninth
circuit,
indicated
that
it
felt
that
due
to
the
same
kinds
of
considerations
that
had
bothered
the
--
the
ninth
circuit,
that
it
should
hear
that
case
pursuant
to
rule
35.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
they
did.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
the
--
the
of
the
panel
members,
there
was
some
disagreement
as
to
the
requirement
but
the
--
the
court
as
a
whole
in
a
--
in
a
vote
that
was
20-to-4
felt
that
they
should
sit
pursuant
to
rule
35.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
the
suggestion
is
that
they
felt
that
there
was
a
--
that
they
did
not
have
to
sit
pursuant
to
437h.
since
the
case
had
only
come
to
them
that
way
from
the
panel,
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
indication
they
would
have
--
have
judged
it
by
the
standards
of
rule
35.
again,
with
regards
to
the
underlying
constitutional
question
that
i
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
--
have
now
three
of
them
including
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
here,
i
think
the
considerations,
the
fears
are
set
forth
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below,
that
at
some
juncture,
a
command
to
the
courts
to
sit
en
banc
becomes
an
interference
with
the
internal
proceedings.
in
--
in
response
to
--
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
my
understanding
of
the
western
pacific
case
was
that
absent
a
statutory
provision
that
the
courts
of
appeals
were
free
to
set
rules
for
the
hearings
of
their
cases
en
banc.
it
would
seem
here
that
that
case
would
not
govern
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
specific
statutory
provision.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
correct,
resolving
the
conflict
with
the
third
circuit,
which
had
held
that
it
had
had
that
power
in
--
in
the
textile
mill's
case,
and
--
and
i
think
western
pacific
follows
that.
i
--
i
don't
think
it
reaches
the
--
the
question
here
where
congress
has
explicitly
put
forward
the
--
the
en
banc
requirement.
it
is
our
contention,
however,
that
that
--
that
is
--
it
does
seem
to
be
a
serious
question
if
one
--
one
that
does
seem
to
have
constitutional
dimensions
at
least
in
the
thought
of
many
of
the
judges
in
the
courts
below,
and
certainly
one
that
would
lend
support
in
our
mind
that
either
to
avoid
that
question
or
to
avoid
that
kind
of
use
of
resources
that
this
court
should
narrowly
construe
437h
as
a
whole
not
to
reach
such
cases
as
ones
like
this
where
the
commission,
after
an
investigation
and
a
notification
to
parties,
where
they
all
rule
out
to
raise
defenses
where
there
were
not
only
that
matters
that
are
at
issue
here,
but
were
matters
of
--
of
excessive
contributions
to
particular
candidates
raised,
failure
to
register
affiliation
that
when
proceedings
like
that
had
--
had
started
or
in
the
--
in
the
lance
case
where
in
effect,
the
commission,
under
a
command
to
investigate
things
expeditiously,
is
--
is
trying
to
obtain
enforcement
of
a
subpoena
that
to
read
437h
to
require
the
courts
of
appeals
to
sit,
listen
and
try
and
decide
in
--
in
a
very
--
in
the
most
abstract
kind
of
setting,
all
constitutional
questions
that
might
be
--
be
raised
is
--
is
not
--
is
--
is
certainly
not
a
good
use
of
judicial
resources
and
one
that
would
not
seem
to
be
mandated
by
the
words
of
the
statute
which,
as
i
say,
seem
to
leave
discretion
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
language
as
may
be
appropriate.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
correct.
they
have
dealt
with
it
in
various
different
ways.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
for
instance,
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
they
there
took
the
case
on
the
437h
certification
but
turned
around
and
said,
“but
the
only
way
we
can
see
to
deal
with
these
issues
that
are
being
raised
is
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
where
you
have,
in
effect,
the
trial
of
the
437g
proceeding.
all
of
the
defenses
were
raised
there.
the
commission
put
on
its
case,
the
defense
put
on
its
case,
it
came
back
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
it's
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
the
commission
is
wrong.
there
is
no
offense
stated.
so,
in
effect,
though,
they
retained
it
there
is
a
437h
case.
they
really,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
did
that
which
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court
should
indicate
to
the
courts
of
appeals
that
they
can
do
under
437h.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
that
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
almost
there
to
be
a
--
a
bootstrapping.
it
seems
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--
to
me
that
they
took
--
took
half
the
loaf
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--
and
i
would
argue
anyway
that
by
not
obeying
the
commands
of
437h,
they
therefore
despite
the
statement
in
their
--
in
their
opinion
were
not
hearing
the
case
pursuant
to
their
437h
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
they
said
they
were.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
those
issues
were
not
fully
explored
there,
but
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
and
that
the
decisions
that
they
--
that
the
decisions
they
reached
would
then
be
reached
in
the
course
of
the
437g
proceeding
which
is
presently
on
appeal
in
the
course
of
normal
events.
it's
on
appeal
in
front
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
we
--
we
would
say
it
was
jurisdictional
and
that
was
our
--
our
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit.
we
said
that
you
should
dismiss
alternately
if
you
conclude
that
you
have
437h
jurisdiction
that
you
should
decide
the
constitutional
questions.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
where
they
refuse
to
follow
--
i
think
the
problem
is
that
where
they
refuse
to
follow
the
commands
of
the
statute
for
them
than
to
say
that
they
were
sitting
under
that
jurisdiction
and
it
also
seems
to
me
that
the
--
though
there
are
--are
exceptions
i
know
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
they
would
have
to
be
--
they
would
have
to
find
and
you
would
have
to
approve
of
their
finding
jurisdiction
under
437h,
but
not
following
the
commands
of
en
banc
because
otherwise,
it
would
seem
or
at
least
we
would
argue
there
was
no
other
statute
that
gives
them
jurisdiction.
rule
35
certainly
doesn't
give
them
jurisdiction.it
would
be
like
an
interlocutory
appeal
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
--
which
could
not
have
been
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
that
it
was
not
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think,
however,
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
suggests
that
the
court
of
appeals
are
concerned
to
understand
whether
or
not
they
are
required
everytime
there
is
an
arguable
constitutional
question
that
comes
up,
as
to
whether
they
are
required
to
sit
en
banc
so
that
though
you
might
find
that
there
was
appropriate
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case
because
they
had
rested
it
in
part
on
437h,
though
i
would
argue
that
their
failure
to
follow
it
would
destroy
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
i
should
make
point
--
i
should
--
the
--
the
dependancy,
the
commission's
proceeding
had
been
pending
for
a
period
of
approximately
a
year,
and
we
would
rely
on
that
fact.
we
have
not
yet
filed
in
the
district
court.
we
had
announced
our
intention
to
in
order
to
try
and
see
if
we
could
settle
the
case
without
going
further,
but
--
but
dependency
of
the
procedures
because
what
seems
to
us,
the
unfortunate
result
here
is
that
you
really
get
a
bifurcation.
you've
got
a
bifurcation
in
the
sense
that
the
question,
the
constitutional
question
goes
up
in
its
various
form.
meanwhile,
the
other
proceeding
continues
and
you
get
a
waste
of
resources,
both
at
the
commission,
but
more
prominently
you
really
get
a
--
a
great
loss
of
resources,
i
think,
in
--
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
mean,
en
banc.
of
course,
the
first
circuit
is
now
being
split,
so
the
20-to-4
is
no
longer
there.
but
as
mr.
zimmerman
has
indicated,
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
is
now
approaching
that
difficulty,
too,
and
that's
an
immense
use
of
judicial
resources.
so
the
indication
that
they
could
narrowly
construe
their
jurisdiction
and
refuse
to
hear
those
questions,
i
think,
would
avoid
this
whole
question
of
whether
or
not
they're
required
to
sit
en
banc.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
of
course,
the
proceedings
in
front
of
the
commission
really
don't
begin
in
informal
ways
as
a
process
for
filing
of
a
complaint
and
notice
to
the
parties
which
sets
forth
this
factual
and
legal
basis.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
would
certainly
say
on
those
circumstances,
it
would
not.
i'm
sure
that
there
might
not
be
informal
proceedings
that
the
commission
if
it
was
holding
rule
makings
on
a
particular
subject
or
some
other
form
that
it
might
not
--
mr.
charles
n.
steele
no,
i
think
that
i'm
only
asking
you
to
--
to
say
that
the
--
the
statute
vests
in
the
courts
a
discretion
under
the
terms
as
may
be
appropriate
only
to
take
under
437h
jurisdiction
very,
very
specialized
kinds
of
cases
which
raise
basically
facial
issues.
i
--
i
must
agree
that
in
any
facial
issue,
you'd
probably
run
into
matters
of
statutory
construction
that
are
at
least
peripherally
related.
but
that
that
was
really
the
sole
purpose
of
437h.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
well,
you
have
--
you
have
a
facial
issue
here
as
well
issues
of
how
it's
applied
because
the
--
the
trial
in
the
court
below
is
related
to
questions
of
--
of
allocation,
was
related
to
other
offenses
so
that
you
--
you
may
have
a
facial
question,
but
you
may
never
reach
it,
which
is,
of
course,
the
other
reason
that
i
would
argue
that
you
should
limit
the
jurisdiction
is
because
you
--
you
may
never
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
it
may
be
resolved
in
other
fashions.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
line
between
--
you
--
you
asked
earlier
the
question
about
the
line
between
as
applied
and
facial,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
totally
clear
in
all
instances,
but
i
think
that's
a
basic
line
that
is
sufficiently
clear
that
that
should
be
hewed
to.
that
as
applied
is
really
remitted
by
the
statute
to
the
advisory
opinion
proceedings
in
the
437g
enforcement
proceedings.
i
would
note
from
--
in
contrast
to
when
--
when
the
statute
was
before
this
court
in
buckley
that
the
advisory
opinion
section
of
the
statute
has
been
altered
in
1979
amendments
to
allow
any
person
to
require
the
commission
an
interpretation
on
any
transaction
they're
involved
in
so
that
in
--
in
vagueness
terms,
the
problem
that
the
court
there
was
concerned
with
has
to
some
extent
been
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
an
advisory
opinion
proceeding
where
the
commission
can
indicate
its
--
its
interpretation
of
the
law
so
that
that
--
that
in
--
that
in
effect,
i
think
that
the
--
those
proceedings
in
front
of
the
commission
are
--
are
adequate
to
take
care
of
as
applied
situations
as
opposed
to
facial.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
substantive
issue
here
raised
because
it
seems
to
be
one
of
considerable
importance.
basically,
the
underlying
thrust
of
the
entire
statute,
which
i
think
that
appellants
here
do
not
really
contest
is
that
the
congress
had
a
right
to
battle
the
perception
that
sizable
campaign
contributions
channeled
through
various
sources
should
not
be
perceived
that
the
appearance
cannot
be
there
that
sizable
campaign
contributions,
not
the
public
interest
is
what
controls.
in
effect,
they
do
not
really
challenge
the
overall
interest
in
the
statute.
the
real
--
the
real
challenge,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
the
--
is
to
the
extent
of
the
limitation.
they
argue
that
the
statute
sweeps
too
broadly
that
the
statute,
could
and
does,
in
more
limited
means,
achieve
the
same
effect.
the
question
there,
it
seems
to
me
is
--
is
what
interests
are
at
stake?
you
have
in
effect
a
statute
which
seeks
to
protect
the
public
interest
against
the
corrupting
power
of
money
in
elections.
on
the
other
side,
you
clearly
have
important
individual
interests
at
stake,
individual
interest
in
speech
and
individual
interest
in
association,
and
those
are
very
precious
individual
freedoms.
but
this
is
not
a
statute
which
proscribes
all
kinds
of
speech.
indeed,
the
statute
speaks
very
narrowly.
each
one
of
the
individual
doctors,
the
43,000
doctors
that
are
members
of
this
association
can
give
that
association
$5000.
each
one
of
those
doctors
can
give
$1000
to
any
candidate
of
his
choice.
each
one
of
those
doctors
can
engage
in
activities,
volunteer
activities
which
are
extent
--
exempted
by
the
statute
from
--
from
the
contribution
definitions.
mr.
charles
n.
steele
yes,
the
individual
--
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
rationale
that
this
court
used
in
--
in
approving
the
$25,000
limitation
and
the
$1000
limitation
on
contributions
to
candidates
is
the
same
rationale
that
is
involved
here,
to
wit
that
you
do
not
have
the
situation,
i
mean,
in
effect
that
that
the
--
the
holding
in
buckley
in
that
area
was
that
the
contribution
limitation
served
a
strong
end
of
this
in
limiting
impropriety
from
permitting
unlimited
contributions.
congress
could,
and
this
is
quoting
from
page
30
of
buckley,
provide
that
the
opportunity
for
abuse
inherent
in
the
raising
of
large
contributions
could
be
controlled
by
contribution
limitations.
and
at
page
38
of
that
opinion,
in
validating
the
$25,000
limitation,
that
same
language
was
used.
and
what
congress
did
in
1976,
following
the
buckley
decision
in
its
attempt
to
try
and
put
the
statute,
to
enact
the
statutes
back
after
the
--
to
reenact
the
commission,
et
cetera,
what
it
did
was
to
say
that
--
well,
what
we
see
is
the
possibility
that
if
you
do
not
put
a
limitation
on
contributions
by
persons
to
committees,
that
you
will
have
inherent
in
that,
a
system
where
there
will
be
many
more
committees,
where
--
where
committees
either
by
direct
or
indirect
means,
people
will
not
be
abiding
by
the
contribution
limits
because
they
will
be
able
give
amounts
to
this
committee,
amounts
to
another
committee
because
persons,
unlike
individuals,
are
not
limited
so
that
association
such
as
--
as
cma
could
give
$5000
to
--
could
give
unlimited
amounts
without
the
$5000
limits
to
as
many
committees
as
they
wanted.
and
that
while
there
are
in
the
statutes,
the
narrow
prescriptions
which
mr.
zimmerman
has
referred
to,
441a(a)(7),
441a(a)(8),
441a(a)(5),
limiting
conduits,
limiting
making
as
a
contribution
anything
done
in
coordination
with
candidates
and
limiting
the
proliferation
of
committees
that
the
very
thrust
of
the
court's
reasoning
in
upholding
the
contributions
limit
previously
was
that
congress
did
not
need
to
rely
on
those
prohibitions,
that
the
--
that
the
contribution
limit
served
an
independent
purpose
by
--
as
the
quote
says,
“avoiding
the
opportunity
for
abuse
inherent
in
the
raising
of
large
contributions.”
mr.
charles
n.
steele
i
think
that
the
--
the
legitimate
constitutional
objective
there
is
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
congress
had
met
under
the
old
statutes
that
the
proliferation
of
committees
was
used
as
a
method
for
avoiding
the
contribution
limitations.
that
the
history
of
the
statutes
before
1971
and
the
history
of
the
hearings
particularly,
i
think,
in
the
47
hearings
are
full
of
the
instances
that
by
creating
a
--
a
variety
of
committees
that
the
then
existing
limitations
were
avoided,
and
that
--
so
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
distinct
constitutional
limit
--
a
constitutional
underpinning
for
the
limitation
of
the
proliferation
of
committees.
i
would
like
to
turn
momentarily
to
the
chores
that
there
is
discrimination
here,
in
the
sense
that
the
provision
limiting
unincorporated
associations,
all
persons
to
$5000
discriminates
in
a
way
against
--
against
those
organizations
because
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
which
are
separately
regulated
and
have
been
again
since
1907,
are
permitted
to
use
their
internal
funds
for
the
cost
of
the
administrative
cost,
the
--
the
very
argument
that
is
here
made
by
the
appellants.
in
effect,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
question
of
classification.
the
congress,
over
the
course
of
--
since
1907,
as
the
first
statute,
again
i
would
not
go
back
through
all
the
history
of
--
of
these
statutes
because
i
think
it's
set
forth
in
--
in
the
--
the
great
trilogy
of
cases
of
u.s.
versus
cio,
the
uaw
case
and
then
the
pipefitters
case
of
the
--
of
the
evolution
of
these
statutes.
but
the
provisions
now
in
441b,
back
then
in
18
u.s.c.
610,
are
really
a
product
of
the
dialogue
between
this
court
and
congress,
where
congress
having
put
a
total
prohibition
on
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
having
concluded
that
those
organizations,
because
of
their
direct
relationship
to
the
economy,
deserved
specialized
treatment.
having
put
that
total
prohibition
on
was
worn
by
this
court
that
that
prohibition
could
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
keeping
the
organization
from
fostering
its
communication
to
its
members
and
the
fostering
its
legitimate
purposes.
so
that
you
have
there
a
compromise
that
was
worked
out
back
and
forth,
of
course,
majorly
in
the
hansen
amendment
which
was
indirectly
before
this
court,
but
heavily
covered
in
the
pipefitters
decision,
saying
that
the
prohibition
of
direct
contribution
to
the
prohibition
of
making
direct
expenditures
in
--
in
elections
is
balanced
in
the
statute
by
provisions
that
specifically
provide
for
communication
and
specifically
resolve
the
then
unanswered
question
under
the
previous
statute
of
that
one
of
the
matters
that
could
be
done,
was
to
provide
for
this
kind
of
administrative
support.
to
suggest
as
the
dissent
below
does,
and
as
i
think
mr.
zimmerman
does
in
his
argument,
that
because
congress,
in
making
that
balancing
out,
has
allowed
corporations
and
labor
organizations
to
spend
those
administrative
expenses,
that
that
is
a
benefit
that
can
be
seen
apart
from
and
distinguished
from
the
overall
total
scheme
of
regulation,
which
substantially
prohibits
corporations
and
labor
organizations
in
a
way
that
no
other
persons
are,
is
to
suggest,
i
think,
as
the
--
as
the
court
--
majority
of
the
court
below
indicated
is
to
suggest
a
false
question.
because
in
effect,
the
classification
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
classification
of
corporations
and
--
and
labor
organizations
would
even
withstand
strict
scrutiny,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court,
in
looking
that,
has
ever
even
thought
that
strict
scrutiny
applied
to
such
a
classification.
but
those
organizations,
what
they
do
is
really
an
offshoot
of
their
economic
interest
and
that
very
powerful,
very
strong
economic
interest
is
what
has
led
to
the
congressional
regulation
of
them.
in
effect,
to
sum
up
the
commission's
argument
on
the
--
on
the
statutory
issue,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
$5000
limitation
on
contributions,
five
times
that
which
could
be
given
to,
by
an
individual
to
a
candidate
of
his
choice,
where
that
was
spoken
of,
as
or
be
it
a
limitation
on
the
matter
of
first
amendment
values
was
a
--
a
limitation
that
was
on
speech,
that
was
not
direct
speech,
but
was
really
speech
that
was
only
--
what
--
what
was
less
direct
than
the
independent
expenditures
issue,
and
the
same
limitation
on
the
$25,000
that
the
$5000
limitation
on
contributions
to
political
committees
serves
the
same
purposes
and
falls
well
within
the
parameters
of
this
court's
decision
on
contributions
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
similarly,
i
think
this
court
should
reject
the
argument
that
because
congress,
in
adhering
to
the
expressed
doubts
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
structure
of
610
and
now
441b,
had
worked
out
a
special
system
of
regulation
that
you
would
find
invidious
discrimination
because
of
that
careful
constitutional
balancing,
which
congress
went
through
in
response
to
this
court's
decisions.
thank
you.
