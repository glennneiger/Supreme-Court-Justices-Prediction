mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
under
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
it
comes
to
this
court
on
appeal
from
an
en
banc
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
sustained
the
validity
of
the
$5000
calendar
year
limitation
on
contributions
to
a
political
committee.
the
case
comes
here
by
way
of
the
unique
judicial
review
provisions
contained
in
2
u.s.c.
437h,
which
provide
for
the
filing
of
actions
to
construe
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
for
the
certification
of
those
actions
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
ultimate
review
on
appeal
in
this
court.
appellants
challenged
that
aspect
of
the
$5000
calendar
year
limit
which
restricts
the
administrative
support
and
unincorporated
association
may
contribute
to
its
political
committee.
appellants
claim
that
the
$5000
limit
violates
the
rights
under
the
first
amendment
and
that
the
statutory
scheme,
which
allows
corporations
and
labor
organizations
to
contribute
unlimited
amounts
of
administrative
support
to
their
political
committees
violates
the
equal
protection
rights
of
appellants.
the
term
“administrative
support”
as
used
by
the
parties
and
the
court
below
refers
to
anything
of
value
used
for
the
purpose
of
establishing,
administering
or
soliciting
contributions
to
the
political
committee.
the
appellant,
california
medical
association,
is
an
unincorporated
membership
organization.
its
membership
consists
of
approximately
25,000
physicians
who
practice
in
california.
the
cma
sponsors
a
political
action
committee
known
as
the
california
medical
political
action
committee.
calpac
receives
in
kind
administrative
support
from
cma.
calpac
also
receives
contributions
from
physicians
who
choose
to
contribute
to
them.
calpac
supports
candidates
who
run
for
federal
office
among
other
things.
appellants,
foster
and
rose
are
members
of
both
cma
and
calpac.
dr.
foster
is
the
treasurer
of
calpac
and
dr.
rose
is
a
past
president
of
cma
and
has
been
an
officer
in
calpac.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
i
--
i
agree
with
it,
your
honor.
they
found
that
they
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
they
--
the
majority
of
any
event,
your
honor,
didn't
hear
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
right.
they
initially,
of
course,
i
think,
convened
pursuant
to
437h.
however,
the
--
the
majority
based
its
decision
to
hear
the
case,
en
banc
at
least,
not
on
section
437h
but
on
rule
35.
but
that
only
deals
with
the
aspect
of
an
en
banc
panel
or
a
three-judge
panel,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
this
isn't
interlocutory
appeal.
it
isn't
a
certification
under
those
general
rules.
it's
a
special
statute
which
permits
a
certification
of
any
questions
of
constitutionality
arising
under
the
act.
it's
a
unique
provision.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
i
think
they
did,
your
honor.
as
i
read
the
decision,
they
--
they
didn't
set
en
banc
pursuant
to
437h.
they
sat
en
banc
pursuant
to
rule
35.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
it's
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
they
sat
en
banc
pursuant
to
rule
35.
and
i
under
that
last
week,
although
i
have
not
read
the
decision,
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
the
same
thing
in
a
case
which
has
been
cited
in
the
briefs,
fec
versus
lance.
in
that
case,
a
three-judge
panel
certified
constitutional
questions
to
the
en
banc
panel,
but
that
case
was
just
decided
and
i
only
get
this
through
counsel
from
the
--
the
commission
but
i
understand
that
they
chose
to
sit
pursuant
to
rule
35
and
hear
the
case
en
banc.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
the
important
aspect
with
respect
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
437h
(b)
is
not
whether
the
court
below
sat
en
banc
pursuant
to
437h
(a)
or
sat
en
banc
pursuant
to
rule
35,
but
rather,
whether
there
was
a
question
properly
certified
to
the
circuit
court
and
whether
there's
been
a
decision
on
that
matter.
now,
that's
what
section
437h
(b)
state.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
oh,
very
simple,
your
honor.
when
the
case
was
certified
to
the
court,
that
judge
browning,
the
presiding
judge
issued
an
order
asking
the
parties
to
direct
the
constitutionality
of
their
requirement
that
the
court
sit
en
banc.
his
question
to
counsel
was
directly
--
directed
at
the
issue
of
the
requirement
the
court
and
panel
itself
en
banc.
and
that
oral
argument,
there
was
considerable
debate
about
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
i
--
i
suspect
they're
doing
it
because
the
ninth
circuit
or
for
the
reason
the
ninth
circuit
indicated
that
they
wanted
to
avoid
that
question.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
that's
it,
your
honor.
the
question
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i
read
that,
your
honor,
as
meaning
to
sit
en
banc,
not
to
hear
the
case,
to
hear
the
case
en
banc.
the
question
that
the
court
was
confronted
with
in
which
--
which
they
addressed
to
counsel
was
why
do
we
have
to
get
together
en
banc?
at
that
time,
the
ninth
circuit
had
13
active
judges.
eleven
of
them
were
actually
in
panel
and
only
nine
participated
in
the
decision.
i
think
the
circuit
now
is
up
to
22
or
23.
it's
a
real
problem
in
getting
a
panel
that
large.
that
was
the
concern
that
--
that
judge
browning
had
when
he
asked
us
to
address
that
question.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
we
didn't,
your
honor.
not
at
all.
but
i
think
the
court
took
the
dispute
from
buckley
versus
valeo.
this
is
exactly
what
the
d.c.
circuit
did
in
that
case.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
i
--
i
don't
see
any
--
any
reason,
your
honor,
at
least,
initially.
now,
i
can
understand
if,
at
some
point,
congress
would
say
all
appeals
from
an
adverse
decision
of
social
security
hearing
officer
must
be
heard
by
an
en
banc
panel
of
the
appropriate
court
of
appeals.
well,
obviously,
the
court
should
be
inundated
with
litigation.
that
would
be
an
impossible
situation.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
only
if
it
involved
a
--
a
problem
with
the
separation
of
powers
which
a
massive
volume
of
--
of
litigation
might.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
--
any
problem
with
it
at
all.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that's
right,
your
honor,
that
the
court
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
not
recently,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i
--
i
may
have,
your
honor,
in
preparation
for
the
hearing
before
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
in
further
addressing
the
jurisdictional
question,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
take
a
look
at
the
procedural
history
of
the
case.
this
--
this
case
was
actually
filed
on
may
7,
1979.
however,
it's
important
to
note
that
earlier
on,
in
october
of
1978,
the
commission
found
reasonable
--
reason
to
believe
that
violations
of
the
$5000
limit
had
occurred
because
cma's
in-kind
support
of
calpac
exceeded
$5000
during
the
years
1976
through
1978.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
five
thousand
dollars,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
general
limit
on
contributions
to
a
political
committee
is
contained
in
this,
section
441(a)(1)(c).
it's
$5000.
i'm
sorry,
that
there's
a
parallel
provision
which
states
the
same
amount.
a
--
a
multi
candidate
committee
may
contribute
$5000
to
another
committee.
all
other
persons
may
contribute
$5000
to
a
political
committee.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
there
is
one
possible
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
there
are
two
problems,
your
honor.
one
is
there's
a
$25,000
maximum
aggregate
limit
per
year
on
individuals.
you
can
only
give
that
much
each
calendar
year.
secondly,
if
the
committees
are
in
any
way
affiliated,
the
anti-proliferation
rule
contained
in
441(a)(a)(5)
would
apply,
and
that
subjects
committees
under
common
control
to
a
maximum
aggregate
limit.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
these
provisions
only
involve
the
constitutionality
of
provisions
of
the
act.
and
indeed,
there
have
been
decisions
where
the
district
court
determined
that,
for
example,
the
constitutional
question
was
frivolous.
one
example
is
gifford
versus
congress,
and
the
district
judge
acting
to
screen
out
a
frivolous
lawsuit
that
dismissed
the
case.
so,
it's
not
every
case.
number
one,
where
a
constitutional
question
is
alleged,
which
will
come
up
under
these
provisions
and
secondly,
of
course,
if
a
none
--
if
--
if
the
case
does
not
involve
a
constitutional
issue,
these
provisions
aren't
available.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
i
--
i
think
i
do,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
makes
a
big
difference
in
this
case.
the
--
the
claim
is
really
our
facial
claims.
we
challenge
this
provision
on
its
face.
we're
most
interested
in
that
aspect
of
the
prohibition
which
limits
administrative
support
as
--
as
opposed
to
across
the
--
the
board
support
for
a
--
a
political
committee.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
as
long
as
the
requirements
of
article
iii
have
been
satisfied,
yes,
and
you
have
to
have
a
case
or
controversy.
you
have
to
have
a
party
that's
got
standing
to
bring
that
to
litigation.
but
if
the
requirements
of
article
iii
are
met
and
there
is
a
constitutional
question,
yes.
i
--
i
think
that's
true.
and
it
gets
to
the
point
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
your
honor,
it
--
i'm
not
sure
i
can
describe
it
only
as
that,
but
i
think
that
that's
the
way
it
frames
up.
we
--
we
questioned
441(a)(a)(1)(c),
that
provides
for
a
$5000
limit
on
contributions
to
a
political
committee.
however,
we
really
are
only
interested
in
that
prohibition
to
the
extent
that
on
its
face,
it
limits
administrative
support
for
a
political
committee
as
opposed
to
some
other
kind
of
support.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
it
does,
i
believe.
the
--
the
reference
is
in
the
complaint
and
the
answer
to
furnishing
goods
and
services
used
to
establish,
administer
and
solicit
contributions
to
calpac.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
it
would
include
everything,
your
honor.
and
--
and
the
way
this
works
is
these
things
are
just
provided
for
calpac.
it's
--
it's
provided
in
kind.
calpac
has
an
office
that
cma
provides
and
so
forth.
now,
if
i
may
turn
for
a
moment
to
--
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
--
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
nature
of
administrative
support.
in
this
--
in
this
instance,
it's
in
kind.
i'm
sure
there
are
cases
where
it
would
not
be
in
kind,
but
this
--
this
is
a
reference
to
all
support
use
for
establishing,
administering
or
soliciting
contributions
to
the
political
committee.
this
in-kind
support
does
a
couple
of
things,
number
one
it
enables
the
committee
to
function
without
any
offset
for
administrative
expenses.
in
other
words,
the
committee
can
collect
voluntary
contributions
from
various
donors,
and
use
those
donations
to
engage
in
political
action,
make
contributions
to
candidates,
make
independent
expenditures
otherwise
engaged
in
political
activity.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
some
of
the
arguments
which
would
go
to
invalidate
the
limit
with
respect
to
administrative
support
also
apply
to
the
statute
across
the
board.let
me
give
you
one
of
them.
the
next
status
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i
think
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
i
--
i
think
there
are
two
inquiries
that
have
to
be
made,
your
honor.
one,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
support
for
the
political
committee?
if
it's
administrative
support,
i
think
there's
absolutely
no
reason
to
presume
that
--
that
a
limit
on
that
administrative
support
prevents
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
which
is
the
underlying
rational
that
justifies
limits
at
all.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference,
your
honor,
presuming
of
course
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that
depends
on
the
reason
the
check
was
--
was
given
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
then,
if
it
was
used
only
for
those
purposes,
that's
fine,
your
honor.
there
is
no
problem.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
that's
--
that's
fine.
that
--
that
is
administrative
support.
there
is
no
problem
there.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
anything
of
value,
your
honor,
used
for
the
purpose
of
establishing,
administering
or
soliciting
contributions
to
political
committee.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
an
office,
staff,
the
secretary,
postage
expenses,
the
heat,
the
gas,
the
light
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
pardon
me?
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
the
cost
of
stationary
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
--
telephones,
by
all
means
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
--
postage
--
everything
--
printing
cost.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
then
it
depends
what
happens
to
the
balance
of
that
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
--
check
and
then
how
it's
used.
but
the
basic
nature
of
administrative
support
is
not
corruptive.
this
--
this
wherewithal
is
provided
for
the
committee
to
function.
it
allows
the
members
of
the
political
action
committee
to
engage
in
political
action.
and
there
is
no
inherent,
corruptive
potential
in
administrative
support.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
are
two
different
relationships
one
is
the
relationship
with
donor
to
committee.
the
second
is
the
relationship
of
committee
to
candidate
or
contributor
to
candidate.
that's
the
nexus
which
requires
regulation.
that's
the
regulation
which
the
court
sustained
in
the
buckley
decision,
to
prevent
quid
pro
quos.
this
is
one
step
removed.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
again,
it's
--
it's
not
something
given
to
a
candidate
at
all.
these
are
donations.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
nexus
is
donor
candidate,
then
there's
a
need
for
limits
and
regulation.
if
the
nexus
is
donor
and
committee,
i
would
say,
“no.”
now,
if
that
committee
happens
to
be
the
candidate's
authorized
committee,
that's
another
matter
all
together.
but
i'm
speaking
here
of
a
multi
candidate
committee
which
supports
a
number
of
different
candidates.
in
this
instance,
which
is
non-partisan
and
has
participated
on
that
basis
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
nexus
that's
being
regulated.
who
is
the
contribution
going
to?
but
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
cash
and
in-kind
support,
i
think
that
common
sense
says
that
administrative
support
given
in
kind
has
virtually
no
potential
to
be
corruptive.
cash
given
for
administrative
expenses,
perhaps,
has
that
potential,
if
it's
misused,
if
it's
not
used
for
administrative
services,
et
cetera.
that's
the
only
distinction
i
can
draw,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
think
as
long
as
this
wherewithal
is
used
for
administrative
purposes,
then,
there's
no
potential
of
corruption.
i
think
there's
only
the
most
attenuated
potential
for
corruption
with
contributions
to
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
but
again,
your
honor,
we're
not
dealing
with
the
contributor
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
(voice
overlap)
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that
will
be
wonderful,
your
honor,
because
that
means
that
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
if
i
was
a
committee,
your
honor?
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
if
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
and
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
if
your
support
is
to
a
political
committee
and
that
committee
uses
that
support
for
administrative
services,
the
--
the
real
potential
for
corruption
is
not
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
not
there,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
to
the
committee,
your
honor,
if
you
say
that
to
a
candidate,
that's
quite
another
matter.
but
if
you
say
to
a
political
committee,
we
will
provide
for
your
administrative
expenses,
that
would
allow
you
to
use
those
voluntary
contributions
you've
received
from
various
donors
in
order
to
make
contributions
to
candidates.
what
happens
there
is,
it
enhances
the
committee's
ability
to
make
contributions
and
otherwise
participate
in
a
political
process
because
the
voluntary
contributions
the
committee
receives
are
not
eaten
up
by
these
administrative
expenses.
each
dollar
that's
collected,
whether
it's
on
the
street
corner
or
from
an
individual
contributor
through
a
mail
solicitation,
can
be
used
for
political
action.
it
can
be
used
for
an
independent
expenditure
or
it
can
be
used
for
making
a
contribution
to
a
candidate.
and
you
don't
have
to
have
25
cents
or
35
cents
or
40
cents
going
to
pay
the
administrative
cost.
and
--
and
that's
the
important
thing.
that
--
that's
why
there's
an
important
associational
right
here
because
the
--
the
wherewithal
provided
by
cma
for
calpac
allows
calpac
to
--
to
function
effectively,
and
to
use
those
voluntary
contributions
calpac
receives
in
order
to
participate
in
a
political
process.
that's
the
magic
of
political
action
committees.
that's
where
it
comes
from.
when
somebody
subsidizes
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
when
someone
subsidizes
the
administrative
expenses,
it
enhances
the
committee's
value,
the
ability
to
engage
in
--
in
a
protected
speech
and
associational
activities.
now,
in
the
buckley
case,
the
court,
of
course,
found
the
contribution
limits
valid
but
invalidated
the
expenditure
limitations,
in
part,
i
think,
because
of
the
absence
of
any
quid
pro
quo
relationships
between
the
person
making
the
expenditures.
the
same
is
true
here.
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
relationship
between
cma
and
candidates.
cma
provides
administrative
support
to
calpac,
no
potential
for
corruption.
so,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
valid
governmental
purpose
served
by
this
regulation.
now,
secondly,
one
of
the
requirements
when
regulating
in
this
area
is
that
the
regulatory
means
be
narrowly
and
directly
defined
that
they
only
deal
with
that
part
of
the
situation
which
requires
regulation.
here,
the
regulations
are
over
broad.
they
regulate
all
support
for
political
committees,
not
just
in-kind
support,
not
just
administrative
support,
but
any
kind
of
support.
the
aclu
brief,
for
example,
points
out
that
if
support
for
a
political
committee
is
given
and
its
earmarked
for
--
for
independent
expenditures,
there's
no
corruptive
potential
to
that
and
it's
not
going
to
be
involved
in
the
candidate
contributor
nexus.
the
money
is
going
to
go
for
independent
expenditures.
the
corruption
and
prevention
of
corruption
rationale
does
not
apply.
the
same
is
true
of
the
administrative
support.
the
--
the
ban
regulates
too
broadly.
in
addition,
in
the
buckley
case,
the
court
found
that
--
that
there
has
to
be
an
absence
of
less
drastic
means.
and
i
think
in
--
in
this
instance,
there
are
less
drastic
needs,
already
operating,
already
available,
dealing
with
the
--
the
problem
of
corruption
and
the
--
the
prevention
of
the
appearance
of
corruption.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
absolutely,
your
honor.
money
is
speech.
money
is
association,
your
honor.
money
and
something
of
value
provided
to
a
political
action
committee
makes
that
committee
work.
it's
the
wherewithal
to
allow
individuals
to
solicit
contributions,
to
have
meetings,
to
make
decisions
on
how
to
contribute
to
candidates,
and
--
and
to
solicit
further
contributions.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
deals
with
an
entirely
different
problem.
the
problem
that
--
that
those
statutes
deal
with
is
number
one,
the
use
of
treasury
money.
that
is
the
vast
accumulations
of
wealth
acquired
by
corporations
and
labor
organizations,
number
one,
and
secondly,
the
non-voluntary
nature
of
the
use
of
that
money.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well
--
well,
they
are,
your
honor,
in
--
in
the
sense
that
corporations
have
first
amendment
rights.
and
i'm
not
--
not
here
to
defend
the
limits
on
corporate
labor
activity,
but
i
think
that
those
limits
were
imposed
for
different
reasons
than
the
limits
imposed
here.
getting
back
to
the
less
drastic
means
available,
just
for
a
moment,
the
act
contains
comprehensive
registration
requirements,
comprehensive
recording
requirements.
there
are
limits
on
contributions
by
individuals,
$1000
per
candidate
per
election.
there's
a
$5000
limit
on
contributions
by
multi
candidate
committees
to
candidates,
and
in
addition
there's
a
$25,000
limit
on
aggregate
contributions
during
a
year
by
an
individual.
in
addition,
there
are
several
anti-evasion
provisions
already
in
effect.
contributions
to
an
authorized
committee
are
considered
as
contributions
to
the
candidate.
expenditures
made
in
cooperation
or
in
coordination
with
a
candidate
are
treated
as
contributions
are
subject
to
the
limits.
the
republication
of
a
candidate's
printed
materials
or
messages
or
graphics
of
any
kind
is
treated
as
a
contribution,
earmarked
contributions,
that
is,
contributions
which
are
given
to
a
committee
with
a
designation.
this
contribution
shall
go
to
congressman
x
and
that
one
shall
go
to
congressman
y.
those
are
treated
as
contributions
by
the
contributor,
the
original
donor
and
the
committee
is
viewed
as
a
conduit
or
intermediary.
in
addition,
there's
the
anti-proliferation
rule.
committees
subject
to
common
control
are
subject
to
a
maximum
aggregate
limit.
so,
i
think
if
you
look
at
these
--
these
provisions,
in
light
of
the
commission's
extensive
regulations,
numerous
advisory
opinions,
you
have
to
come
back
with
a
conclusion
that
there's
a
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
already
in
place.
and
there
are
less
drastic
means
to
deal
with
problems
which
might
be
involved
when
there
is
support
provided
to
a
political
committee.
i
will
conclude
at
that
point
and
reserve
what
ever
time
is
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel's
interpretation
of
two
separate
provisions
regarding
jurisdiction
would,
in
effect,
merge
two
very
different
statutes.
one
looks
backwards.
it
deals
with
enforcement,
with
the
correction
of
a
wrong
already
done
with
the
potential
fine
for
a
violation,
and
that's
437g.
the
other
looks
forward.
it
allows
actions
for
declaratory
relief,
actions
to
construe
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
it's
an
extraordinary
provision
because
the
rights
involved
here
are
extraordinary.
it's
important
to
keep
the
distinction
clearly
in
mind
that
the
statutes
should
not
be
merged.
they're
separate
for
very
important
reason.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
yes,
your
honor,
and
--
and
to
cause
us
to
wait
for
the
commission
to
file
enforcement
proceeding,
and
to
wait
for
them
to
move
it
through
the
courts
and
--
and
to
rely
on
the
vagaries
of
their
administrative
processes
leading
up
to
an
enforcement
action,
means
that
we
have
to
put
off
the
resolution
of
those
questions.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
you
honor,
we
are
participating
in
the
--
in
the
political
process
and
the
commission
indicates
we've
violated
the
law
in
an
administrative
ruling.
we
have
no
recourse,
but
to
wait
for
them
to
do
something
or
to
bring
an
action,
to
construe
the
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that's
fine,
your
honor,
but
that's
done
then
at
--
at
our
peril
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
--
and
that's
the
purposes
of
this
section.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
well,
your
honor,
but
in
the
election
mockery
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
absolutely.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
it's
so
important
that
we
need
this
section.
secondly
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
they
did
go
ahead
simultaneously.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
that's
fine.
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
your
honor,
there
was
a
motion
to
stay
in
the
enforcement
action.
we
made
the
motion
to
preserve
you
know,
working
on
two
--
mr.
rick
c.
zimmerman
--
cases
at
once
and
judge
(inaudible)
denied
that.
