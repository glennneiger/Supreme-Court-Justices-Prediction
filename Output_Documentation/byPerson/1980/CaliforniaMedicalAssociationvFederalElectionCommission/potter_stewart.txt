justice
potter
stewart
but
what
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
the
--
in
their
opinion
on
the
(inaudible)
we
hear
the
appeal
en
banc
pursuant
to
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
page
--
number
35,
and
the
jurisdiction
is
conferred
by
among
others,
437h,
confirming
what
you've
just
told
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
in
mr.
justice
white's
example,
the
size
of
the
check
might
have
something
to
do
with
it.
if
i
had
check
for
$50
million
simply
because
it
was
labeled
for
administrative
support,
would
not
be
necessarily
for
administrative
support
if
the
showing
were
that
all
the
administrative
expenses,
however,
liberally
construed,
did
amount,
of
no
more
than
$50,000.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
although
every
--
as
i
understand
it,
at
least,
every
court
of
appeals
has
accepted
the
basic
appealability
provisions
of
437h
and
they
--
what
they've
done
is
duck
the
en
banc
requirement
of
437h.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
but
--
but
in
--
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
while
it
avoided
the
--
what
it
thought
to
be
the
--
an
issue,
a
serious
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
en
banc
requirement,
nonetheless
accepted
the
merits
of
the
appeal
under
437h,
although
i
guess
it
would
have
been
an
--
well,
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
not
appealable
under
the
general
appeal
statute.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
although
they
said
they
were.
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed,
that's
pretty
much
what
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
said
it
was
doing
in
buckley
against
valeo
in
a
case
in
which
we
accepted
jurisdiction
under
437h,
appellate
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
they
were
--
perhaps
they
were
not.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
contributions
go,
each
one
--
each
doctor
is
limited
to
a
total
of
$25,000
per
annum,
isn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
here,
the
--
your
defense
to
the
437g
action
was
precisely
the
same
as
your
offense
in
the
437h
action,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that's
the
--
that's
the
faith
of
most
litigants.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
can
just
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
think
is
right
and
then
--
and
then
will
bring
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
most
litigants
have
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
say
that
congress
has
provided
that
you
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
have
to
do
that.
