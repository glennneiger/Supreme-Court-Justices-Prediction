justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
they
report
to
sit
under
the
rule
rather
than
under
the
--
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
why
the
other
courts
are
doing
it,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
whether
or
not
congress
constantly
could
require
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
i
can
understand
that
argument
as
addressed
to
this
court,
but
i
have
trouble
following
it
addressed
to
the
courts
that
are
created
by
the
congress.
justice
white
anyway,
they
avoided
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
avoiding
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
jury's
counsel
pursue
or
press
rule
35
on
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
zimmerman,
does
the
record
tell
us
exactly
what
this
administrative
support
includes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
exam
does
include
the
telephone
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
judge
the
case
here
on
the
assumption
that
the
--
the
limit
that's
placed
on
contributions
to
these
committees
for
non-administrative
purposes
is
valid?
justice
white
well
--
justice
white
so
--
your
answer
is,
“no,
we
don't
judge
the
case
on
that
basis.”
justice
white
you
--
you
don't
concede
or
suggest
that
this
--
justice
white
--
statute
is
--
was
valid
or
is
otherwise
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
--
is
that
--
would
it
make
any
difference
if
they
gave
a
--
a
check
instead
for
administrative
support?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean?
what
would
be
--
would
that
be
administrative
support
under
your
approach
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
written
on
it,
what
it
was
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
they
could
--
they
just
put
in
their
bank
account
and
they'd
pay
their
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
extent
that's
used
for
administrative
purposes,
it
isn't
going
to
some
candidate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there's
no
connection
between
the
donor
and
the
candidate.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
difference
in
terms
of
corruptive
influence
between
what
was
giving
a
candidate
the
$200,000
in
cash
and
giving
him
an
airplane
and
a
van
to
go
around
with
him
and
pay
all
his
phone
bills
and
do
all
his
canvassing,
and
spend
$200,000.
now,
why
is
one
more
corruptive
than
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
if
you're
talking
about,
would
you
say
then
that
the
distinction
between
cash
and
administrative
support
would
not
be
a
valid
distinction
if
the
donations
are
right
to
a
candidate
as
opposed
to
a
committee?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
really
just
questioning
your
distinction
between
cash
and
administrative
support.
was
there
really
any
strength
to
that
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
it
depends
on
what
you
think
of
as
corruption
if
you're
talking
about
the
candidate
putting
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
just,
you
know,
using
it
for
personal
matters.
that's
one
thing,
but
we're
talking
about
filling
under
a
very
definite
obligation
to
a
donor.
i
don't
see
it
makes
much
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
just
--
i'm
just
now
questioning
the
validity
of
your
distinction
for
in-cash
and
in-kind.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
the
panel
members
sit
only
en
banc?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
35?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
suggest
whether
they
would
--
had
there
been
437
that
they
would
have
sat
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
steele,
am
i
not
correct
in
thinking
your
fundamental
position
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
--
everything
else
follows
from
that,
in
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
and
therefore,
an
appeal
was
properly
or
the
question
was
properly
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
if
in
fact
they
sat
en
banc,
then
there'll
be
no
--
no
jurisdictional
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
relies
on
the
fact
that
there
was
then
anything,
a
proceeding
before
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
view
with
the
jurisdiction
is
that
it
determines
on
a
proceeding
being
pending
before
the
commission?
as
soon
as
the
proceeding
is
instituted
before
the
commission
in
some
informal
way
the
district
court
will
lose
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
is
it
a
formal
proceeding
before
the
commission
would
oust
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction
under
437h?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
really
ask
is
to
rewrite
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
a
facial
issue
here,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
--
that
your
case
and
the
commission's
case,
if
it
brought
one,
couldn't
go
ahead
simultaneously.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
came
to
judgment
first
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
might
--
and
you
might
seek
review
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
remember
turning
that
--
