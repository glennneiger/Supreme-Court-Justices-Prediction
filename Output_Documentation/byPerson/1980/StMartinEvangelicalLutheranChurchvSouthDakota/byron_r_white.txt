suppose
there
had
never
been
that
third
exception?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
just
superfluous
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
on
nonparochial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
never
needed
to
exempt
the
kinds
of
schools
involved
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
that
was
never
the
view
of
the
service,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
issue
exemptions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
never
have
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you
never
knew
why
the
tax
wasn't
collected
from
religious
schools?
you
didn't
know
which
ones
of
the
exemptions
was
being
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
the
supreme
court
changed
its
mind,
the
south
dakota
statute
would
continue
to
mean
exactly
what
it
meant.
justice
white
and
the
department
of
labor.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
the
institutions
of
higher
learning
that
are
religious
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
for
purposes
of
the
statute?
why
wouldn't
an
institution
of
higher
learning
that
is
controlled
by
a
church,
why
wouldn't
it
fall
within
subsection
(a)
or
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it's
being,
it's
still
part
of
the
church?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
none
of
them...
i
mean,
all
of
them
are
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
them
are
included.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
none
of
them
are
exempt.
and
nobody
goes
through
this
routine
of
seeing
whether
they
are
performing
a
church
function
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
has
that
been
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
not
covered
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
repealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
know
that
colleges
were
exempt
under
that
section
rather
than
under
the
church
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
your
argument
be
different
if
the
exemption
that
was
repealed
had
exempted
the
employees
of
church-related
and
other
private
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
congress
had
thought
that
it
was
repealing
the
exemption
for
those
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
plain
language
of
(1)(a)
at
least,
to
be
exempt,
the
employment
has
to
be
of
the
church,
or
convention,
or
association
churches,
not
of
a
separate
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you'd
have
to
decide
what
"religion"
was,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
any
hearings
on
this
exemption?
when
it
was
repealed,
when
it
was
revoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
nothing
in
the
hearings,
no
data
in
the
hearings
as
to
what
kind
of
employees,
how
many
employees
were
being
affected?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
figure
was
242,000
employees
of
private
schools.
that's
what
the
figure
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
did
that
come
from?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
hearings
as
to
where
it
came
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
in
the
congressional
hearings?
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
in
the
hearings,
nothing
in
the
testimony
taken,
none
of
the
correspondence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
normally,
though...
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
normally,
when
you
use
the
word
"church"
you
think
about
a
church
school
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
ordinary
language
you'd
talk
about
those
things
as
different
entities.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
legally,
you're
quite
right.
but
most
people
would
say,
where
are
you
going
today?
you'd
usually
say,
i'm
going
to
school,
not
to
church.
justice
byron
r.
white
ask
anybody
where
he
works,
he
says,
i
work
at
the
baptist
school.
he
doesn't
say
i
work
for
a
church.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
an
elementary
school
operated
by
the
church
ever
be
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
something,
if
the
exemption
is
available,
the
authorities
would
have
to
decide.
they
would
have
to
decide
between
schools
that
were
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes
and
the
ones
that
were
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
sullivan...
except
for
one
thing.
suppose
you
lose
this
case,
that
the
exemption
is
not
available,
or
that
it
is
available.
what
do
you...
do
you
think
there
is
any
constitutional
question?
