we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
st.
martin's
evangelical
church
v.
south
dakota.
mr.
schilling,
i
think
you
may
now
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
because
of
the
interaction
with
the
federal
law
and
the
question
in
the
case,
that
that
alters
the
usual
rule
that
we
won't
reexamine
a
state
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
that
they
are
essentially
the
same,
substantially
the
same
as
the
sunday
school
classes
or
summer
school
classes
held
traditionally
at
lutheran
churches
and
others?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
it's
an
implement
of
the
faith
of
that
church?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state
has
police
power
to
require
attendance
at
primary
school,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
it
any
different
in
this
situation
from
the
schools
of
the
roman
catholic
churches
and
others
that
we
have
dealt
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
what
you
stand
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--but
you're
standing
on
(b)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--standing
on
(b).
that's
my?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
afraid
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
snyder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
building
is
relevant
at
all
to
the
legal
issues
in
this
case,
is
it
not
a
fact
that
in
many
cases
churches
and
parochial
schools
are
all
one
structure,
a
city
block,
one
part
of
it
assigned
for
worship
services,
and
one
part
assigned
for
teaching?
but
all
in
the
same
building.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
building
isn't
really
very
important
to
the
legal
issue,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
meierhenry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
take
it
your
point
is
that
if
they
share
some
of
these
things,
this
dilutes
the
church
or
religious
aspect.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
a
concrete
example.
the
cardinal
of
the
archidiocese
of
washington
has
a
residence
and
a
cook
and
a
housekeeper.
under
(a)
is
that
person
exempt,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
0
[recess.]
you
may
continue,
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
suggest
that
differs
from
the
states
which
require
attendance,
so
far
as
the
issues
here
are
concerned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
narrowly,
narrowly,
the
church's
embarking
in
this
enterprise
is
for
strictly
religious
purposes,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don't
want
the
public
school
system,
or
some
of
the
people
don't?
they
don't
want
the
public
school
system,
they
want
their
system
with
its
heavy
emphasis
on
training
in
faith
and
morals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
all
they
printed
in
that
print
shop
were
bibles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
it
is
in
the
roman
catholic
church.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
hypothetical
was
to
remove
from
all
doubts
the
factual
question
about
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
religious
document.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
seem
to
place
great
emphasis,
mr.
attorney
general,
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
committee,
a
board,
designated;
but
the
minister
of
the
church
can't
be
expected
to
run
everything.
can't
he
appropriately
delegate
the
detailed
management
of
the
school
to
the
subcommittee
of
the
church?
isn't
that
what
he
does
here?
they're
certainly
bound
to
be
church
members,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
you'd
have
a
committee
of
the
church
on
visitation
of
parishioners
and
a
whole
lot
of
other
things.
so
there's
no
corporate
veil
to
pierce
here,
is
there,
really?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--no,
but
there's
no
one
compels
them
to
work
for
one
of
these
institutions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
accept
that
broad
a
thing,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
exceptions
at
all.
chief
justice
burger
even
the
ministers
of
churches
will
sometimes
become
unemployed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
any
paid
teachers
in
sunday
schools,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
can't
answer
that
i
think
i
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
generally
speaking
in
this
country,
in
all
faiths,
sunday
school
teachers
are
volunteers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you're
taking
yourself
out
of
this
statute,
though,
i
suggest.
and
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
no,
i
think
your
time
has
expired
also.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
