justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
point
of
it
is
that
if
your
state
supreme
court
construed
the
statute
in
reliance
on
an
understanding
of
federal
law
that
we
say
was
erroneous,
and
we
send
it
back,
we
couldn't
change
it
from
your
state
supreme
court;
but
we
could
send
it
back
to
them,
that's
the
suggestion,
and
let
them
reconsider
their
interpretation
of
the
state
statute
in
light
of
what
we've
said
about
the
federal
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
might
have
another
case.
justice
jr.
if
you
can't
come
under
(a),
then
you'll
take
(b)?
justice
jr.
well,
your
problems
were
certainly
non-existent
before
they
repealed
(3).
justice
jr.
it
fell
right
under
(3)
and
now
you
say,
you
also
fall
under
(1)(a)
and
(1)(b)
if
you
can't
get
under
(1)(a)?
justice
jr.
where
did
those
figures
come
from,
those
242
and
261?
justice
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask,
i
gather
that
(a),
obviously,
is
limited;
(b)
can't
include
a
church,
because
(a)
is
the
exemption
for
a
church.
what
is
an
organization
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes,
et
cetera,
if
it's
neither
church
nor
parochial
school?
justice
jr.
seminaries,
you
mean?
justice
jr.
why
couldn't
they
say,
seminaries?
everyone
knows
what
a
seminary
is.
justice
jr.
if
they
have
a
diocesan
paper,
for
example,
and
they
have
their
own
print
shop,
would
the
printers,
do
you
think,
fall
under
(b)
as
exempt
under
(b)?
justice
jr.
well,
a
diocesan
paper
is
a
purely
religious
paper,
isn't
it?
newspaper?
