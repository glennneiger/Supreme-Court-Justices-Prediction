mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
morning
in
watertown,
south
dakota,
where
st.
martin's
lutheran
academy
is
located...
i
think
it's
important
to
note,
because
the
state
believes
the
second
part
of
petitioners'
claims
are
most
appropriate,
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
first
amendment...
this
morning
when
the
children
went
to
school
they
all
went
on
public
school
transportation.
some
of
those
children
went
to
a
public
school,
some
of
them
got
off
at
st.
martin's
academy.
and
throughout
the
day
these
children
who
went
on
different
tracks
were
constantly
involved
in
numerous
entanglements,
if
you
would.
they
both
ate
food
prepared
by
private
citizens,
but
the
food
probably
came
under
government
programs.
both
children
in
both
schools
could
have
had
speech
and
hearing
diagnostic
services
provided
for
them,
which
is
approved,
they
most
probably
used
library
books
furnished
by
either
state
or
federal
funds
at
st.
martin's
academy--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
not
so
much
that
as
to
the
point
made
by
my
colleague
that
there
will
be
entanglement,
should
this
one
small
portion
of
the
operation
of
these
parochial
schools
be
subject
to
some
taxation.
in
other
words,
some
extraction,
of
coming
under
the
unemployment
compensation
laws,
whether
that
will
so
entangle
the
state
with
the
operation
of
these
parochial
schools
as
to
violate
the
first
amendment.
my
example
mainly
goes
to
point
out,
if
it
will,
to
the
court,
that
this
is
really
not
an
issue,
because
this
entanglement,
by
the
acceptance
of
these
benefits
by
church
schools,
has
eliminated
that.
and
here
in
this
instance...
and
i
argue
on
behalf
of
the
state
for
what
you
will
call
the
people
employed
by
the
schools,
in
other
words,
the
cooks
and
the
janitors.
we
recognized
by
our
referee
below
and
in
our
supreme
court,
that
those
teachers
who
are
on
call,
who
are
part
of
a
religious
order
or
part
of
their
particular
religious
following,
that
they
are
exempted
under
section
(b)
of
the
exemptions.
so,
if
they
are
ministers,
they
are
not
covered
by
unemployment
insurance,
and
we
don't
make
the
claim
that
they
are.
what
we're
worried
about,
and
congress
was
worried
about
it
from
the
beginning
of
the
unemployment
law,
what
about
the
janitor
who
is
laid
off?
what
about--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
think
that
some
would
be
and
some
would
not
be,
depending
on
a
factual
determination.
as
brought
before
this
court,
those
members
of
the
wisconsin
evangelical
lutheran
church
who
were
called...
in
other
words,
their
contractual
relationship
with
the
school
is
such
that
they
are
considered
ministers
of
the
church,
teaching--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
correct.
i
think,
though,
that
if
you
look
at
the
exemptions
and
how
they
occurred,
from
'70
to
1976
to
the
present,
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
need
for
the
exemption
of
ministers
and
those
people
who
belong
to
a
religious
order,
for
the
first
exemption.
you
would
have
no
need
for
that
for
pastors
and
members
of
the
order.
and
the
third
exemption
prior
to
the
change,
which
we're
arguing
about,
had
to
do
with
schools.
and
everywhere
in
their
briefs
it
is
always,
"church
schools".
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it's
always
"church
school".
there's
always
an
adjective.
we're
talking
about
private
schools,
church
schools,
and
public
schools.
but
we're
always
talking
about
schools,
and
that's
what
the
referee,
operating
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
south
dakota,
found,
is
it
was
a
school
and
not
a
church,
and
not
subject
to
the
first
exemption.
because
if
that's
carried
to
a
logical
end,
a
religious
order
or
a
religious
society
could
declare
most
anything
to
be
in
the
furtherance
of
their
religion.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
we
don't
have
an
income
tax
in
our
state,
but
i
would
say
this,
that--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no.
the
second
part
of
the
exemption
we
recognize.
it
says,
"ministers".
and
we
have
in
this
case
given
to
them
this
exemption
as
to
ministers.
but
you
don't
have
to
be
a
minister--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
right.
but
you
don't
have
to
be
a
minister
to
be
a
cook,
or
a
minister
to
be
a
janitor.
and
that's
what
the
unemployment
law
is
talking
about.
because
if
they
closed
down
the
school,
those
people
who
are
in
the
teaching
ministry
are
called
to
another
place.
they're
not
unemployed.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
i
did
not
agree
under
(1)(a).
what
i
said
was,
i
think
that
the
state
can
make
the
determination
regardless
of
what
the
legal
or
the
paper
trail
of
the
legal
entity
is.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
did,
sir,
but
the
state
can
make
the
determination
of
what
is
a
church
purpose,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
guess
it's
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
argue
that
those
individuals--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
a
question
of
the
chief
justice,
when
we
broke
for
lunch,
we
would
point
out,
and
would
like
the
court
to
be
aware,
that
these
petitioners,
and
in
fact
all
of
the
lutheran
schools
in
the
state
of
south
dakota
have
submitted
themselves
to
the
state
and
are
accredited
schools.
but
i
want
to
point
that
we're
perhaps
a
unique
state.
we
require
education
in
south
dakota.
we
do
not
require
attendance
at
schools.
therefore,
you
could
educate
your
children
in
your
own
home
and
you
have
to
be
tested
to
show
that
you're
making
academic
progress.
but
you
are
not
required
by
compulsory
school
attendance
to
attend
a
school
in
south
dakota.
however,
these
petitioners,
in
both
instances,
have
submitted,
and
i've
lodged
with
the
court
the
documents,
a
copious
filing,
making
them
an
accredited
school
in
the
state
of
south
dakota.
and
that
is
the
only
time
in
our
legal
jargon
that
you
can
be
called
a
school
is
if
you
are
accredited.
you
are
either
a
school
and
accredited
under
the
state
auspices,
or
you're
not.
but
you
don't
have
to
be
a
school
and
you
comply
with
our
law
of
educating
your
children
either
by
doing
it
in
your
home
or
with
a
group
of
others.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
definition
and
the
exemptions,
and
i
think
that
we
recognize,
as
the
court
does,
that
this
does
have
to
be
applied
across
the
land.
and
when
one
is
in
the
employ,
as
an
exception,
of
a
church
or
convention
or
association
of
churches,
i
think
our
supreme
court
narrowly
interprets
that
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
that
would
probably
refer
to
the
cook
for
the
bishop
in
those
things
that
are
obviously
only
religious.
there
is
not
an
educational
purpose
in
being
a
cook
for
the
bishop.
what
there
goes
on
which
is
probably
closer
in
(b)
of
3309,
it
says:
"or
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes
and
which
is
operated,
supervised,
controlled,
or
principally
supported
by
a
church
or
convention
or
association
of
churches.
"
that's
close,
but
we
have
to
remember,
when
all
these
exemptions
were
entered,
number
(3)
was,
in
the
employ
of
a
school;
which
has
now
been
eliminated.
and
so,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
these
people
in
our
opinion,
as
the
documents
we
lodged
show,
which
were
lodged
for
accreditation
purposes,
they
were
filed
by
the
principal
of
the
school,
and
they
were
done
in
the
name
of
the
school.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
might
have
been.
but
in
south
dakota
they
could
not
have
been
a
school
without
meeting
accreditation
purposes;
in
other
words,
making
certain
statements
and
complying
with
certain
academic
standards,
and
employing
certain
types
of
teachers,
and
open
a
certain
number
of
days,
which
would
reduce
that
being
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
they
were
operated
primarily
as
an
educational
institution.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
believe
it
does,
because
what
our
appeals
referee
decided
and
our
supreme
court
decided
is
that
this
school,
st.
martin's
academy,
which
is
still
going
on,
was
not
primarily
for
religious
purposes
but
was
primarily
for
educational
purposes,
and
to
be
taught
with
religious
overtones,
you
might
say,
or
in
the
way
that
they
wish
to
do
it.
but
it
was
primarily
for
education.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
could
be,
but
there
is
a
desire
wherein
i
believe--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
then
we
are
told--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
it
would
be
those
instances
where
it
was
an
institution
to
train
ministers
and
only--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--seminaries?
it
could
be.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
it's
not
for
me
to...
but
i
think
that
it
also
goes
to
this
extent,
mr.
justice,
that
certain
publishing
duties,
perhaps
certain
insurance
duties,
that
would
only
have
something
to
do
with
perhaps
the
churches
themselves,
not
a
true
free
marketplace-type
company.
and
i
think
here
what
they're
saying
is
it's
limiting
it
because
they're
not
going
to
allow,
or
congress
is
not
going
to
allow
for
the
purposes
of
covering
employees
of
a
church-related
organization;
if
they
go
into
tuna
fishing,
or
lumbering,
a
lumber
company
or
mining.
so
it's
going
to
be
a
test--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
would
think
not
because
of
the
pilgrim
holiness
case
which
applied
the
minimum
wage
requirements
of
the
fair
labor
act,
because
in
that
case,
which
this
court
denied
cert;
it
was
a
lower
court
case,
but--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
it
would
be
much
closer
and
it
would
stand
the
test,
this
court
having
read--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
terms.
that
could
well
be,
then,
if
it
were
only
to
print
a
paper
for
dissemination
to
the
church.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
in
that
case
that
representing
a
state
i
would
say,
yes;
if
it
was
organized
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
not,
especially
in
this
case
where--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
that
that
would
be
a
duty
of
whatever
government
to
decide
that.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
think
because
at
the
time
it
was
passed
in
1970,
the
paragraph
(3)
directly
approached
schools.
it
says,
"in
the
employ
of
a
school
which
is
not
an
institution
of
higher
education.
"
and
i
think
congress
at
that
time
definitely
looked
at
schools,
as
some
of
the
underlying
congressional
language
reveals,
that
they
were
talking
about
schools--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
i
think
there
probably
would
be
a
great
number
of
them.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
can't
speak
and
i
don't
know
but
i
would
say
that
if
a
church
were
to
have
a
fleet
of
school
buses
that
were
organized
as
a
corporation,
only
to
bring
children
to
bible
classes
or
sunday
school
classes,
that
that
organization
could
be
organized
for
the
purposes
of
religion,
and
if
the
buses
were
not
used
in
general
commerce.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
there
could
be
a
great--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--but
i
think,
as
you
watch
the
legislative
history
of
1970,
they
specifically
approach
schools,
and
then
in
1978
they
specifically
said
that
schools,
whether
they're
public,
private,
or
parochial
schools,
would
not
have
an
exemption.
because
we
have
to
remember
that
this
act
was
passed
for
the
benefit
of
employees,
of
people
who
are
hired
by
others,
whether
they're
hired
by
schools,
or
whatever,
and
that
these
were
exemptions.
and
i
think
it
was
in
the
intent
of
congress,
as
they
have
consistently
broadened
unemployment
coverage,
was
to
narrow
the
scope
of
exemptions.
and
when
they
looked
at
the
schools,
they
said,
if
we
just
exempt
private
schools,
and
we
just
exempt
public
schools,
then
are
we
not
approaching
the
establishment
of
religion
if
we
just
overlook
those
religious
schools
and
just
those
employees
will
be
without
protection.
and
i
think
that's
a
logical
argument
as
to
why
that
each
employee,
whether
he's
working
in
a
private
school
that
may
be
started
by
environmentalists
to
promote
an
environmentalist
cause,
and
still
teach,
but
the
primary
purpose
is
education.
and
so,
when
these
schools,
in
our
states--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--and
that's
why
we
believe
that--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--then
there
would
have
to
be
a
decision
made,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
by
the
appeals
referee,
that
these
two
institutions
were
not
primarily
for
educational
purposes.
because
these
schools,
these
parochial
schools
in
our
state--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
right,
and
i
think
great
weight
has
to
be
given
to
the
appeals
referee
who
did
determine
these
issues.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
guess
that
is
in
my
mind
one
of
the
issues.
i
say
the
employer
is
the
school,
it
is
the
school,
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
but
the
fact
remains--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
factually
that's
correct.
the
legal
effect
of
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
bring
to
your
attention,
is
the
fact
that
also
their
description
of
a
church,
their
description
of
a
church
is
again
not
an
entity,
it's
an
organization
of
believers
or
followers,
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
simply
the
trail
of
the
dollar
that
ultimately
pays
for
this.
it
does
pass
through
the
church.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
i
believe
that
if
they
fall
under
any
exception,
it's
not
(a),
it's
(b),
which
is
an
organization--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
would
say
not.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
i
would
say,
not.
because
the
individual,
as
the
records
show
here,
the
individual
is
paid
by
the
church,
but
they're
employed
by
the
school
with
their
separate
board
to
oversee...
which
is
within
the
church,
but
it's
a
separate
board
which
hires
a
principal
and
eventually
runs
the
school,
the
entity.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
but
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
determination--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
again,
this
is
an
instance,
which
is
the
only
case
before
it,
but
our
determination
by
our
supreme
court
was
that
this
instance
fell
under
(b)
and
that
it
was
not
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
right;
there
is
no
exemption.
but
they
approached
from
that
standpoint,
that
it
was
not
primarily
for
religious
purposes,
but
also--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
i
don't
think
that
we
could
deny
a
church
the
opportunity...
as
a
wild
example...
to
buy
a
professional
baseball
team.
i
think
they
could
do
that,
and
i
think
they
could
set
up
their
accounting
practices
in
such
a
way
that
the
money
flowed
from
the
church,
but
that's
certainly
not
an
organization,
although
it's
operated
by
a
church
and
it's
supervised
by
a
church
and
owned,
but
it's
not
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i'm
not
here
arguing
the
intent
of
the
congress.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
interpreting
the
language
of
congress
when
they
set
out
the
three
exemptions,
i
think
it
was
clear
that
they
separated.
it's
for
this
court
obviously
to
decide
what
congress
intended
and
what
congress
wanted.
but
i'm
not
going
to
concede
that
they
are
employed
by
the
church.
they're
employed
by
the
school,
for
the
simple
reason...
and
this
court
on
many
occasions
has
pierced
corporate
veils.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
would
think
so;
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
think
there
is,
because
this
is
an
organization
which
congress
recognized,
that
there
were
going
to
be
organizations,
spin-offs
from
churches,
of
other
duties.
and
so
i
think
that's
why
it
comes
under
(b);
and
then
the
test,
is
it
primarily,
primarily
for
educational
purposes?
and
we
would
submit
that
it
isn't.
the
one
final
issue,
should
the
court--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
i
did...
the
employer
is
the
school,
which
is
a
subsidiary,
if
you
will,
of
the
church,
perhaps,
but
it
is
a
separate
entity,
and
it
is
intended,
as
these
schools,
and
they're
being
organized,
two,
three
a
day,
with
the
resultant
work
force,
and
they're
operated
for
different
reasons,
never
once
questioning
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
but
private
schools
with
religious
overtones
are
being
created
two
a
day
all
over
the
country.
and
i
suggest
that
that's
going
to
require
a
huge
labor
force.
our
citizens
do
not
go
to
their
parochial
school
and
bring
coal
to
start
the
fire.
they
hire
a
janitor.
they
do
not
take
turns
sweeping
out
the
hallways.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
but
the
intent
of
congress
is
for
one
reason,
under
the
unemployment
law,
those
people
who
are
thrown
out
of
work...
and
we're
talking
about
a
very
few
people
here,
as
i
think
we
recognize...
those
people
who
are
thrown
out
of
work
by
the
discontinuance
of
this
operation
should
be
covered
by
unemployment.
i
want
to
cover
one
thing
and
and
submit
the
rest
of
my
time--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
directed
us...
and
i
might
say,
i'm
like
two
bookends
here,
because
the
state's
in
between
having
our
funds
cut
off
by
the
federal
government,
and
be
attacked
on
this
side...
i
would
say
that
then
it's
a
test,
like
so
many
other
employment
tests,
where
are
his
duties
lodged?
and
in
that
regard,
i
want
to
talk
about
the
monetary
effect...
because
it's
very
vast,
and
it's
very
important
to
our
state,
which
is,
according
to
the
census
bureau,
the
poorest
state
in
the
union...
is
the
fact
that
money
will
flow
back
and
forth,
no
matter
what
this
court
decides.
and
secondly...
and
it's
important
to
note...
these
schools
need
not,
in
our
state,
under
our
system,
pay
any
tax
dollars,
none
whatsoever.
they
can
go
under
the
reimbursable
method,
which
is
allowed
for
these
schools,
and
they
are
not
required
to
pay
into
the
fund
any
dollars
unless
they
lay
someone
off,
and
then
they
must
agree
to
reimburse
the
person
that's
laid
off.
so
one
of
the
things
that
should
be
recognized
by
this
court,
although
we
have
talked
a
lot
of
words
and
been
in
a
lot
of
courts,
it
may
not
ever
result
in
anyone
drawing
unemployment
insurance
in
south
dakota.
because
if
they
are
a
minister,
and
they're
on
call,
they'll
move;
they
won't
submit
to
unemployment
insurance.
and
if
those
other
individuals
truly
work
for
the
church,
they'll
still
be
working
for
the
church
when
the
schools
close.
and
so--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
first
of
all
that
that
is
an
issue
that
probably
will
not
come
up
except
in
very
limited
circumstances.
but
i
would
say
this
that
that
test
is
one
like
every
other
employment
test,
and
i
think
that
a
hearing
referee
can
very
easily
recognize
that
there
is
a
different
standard
of
conduct
for
that
teacher
compared
to
a
public
school
teacher
or
a
private
school
teacher.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
time
and
indulgence.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
submit
my
time,
if
i
have
any
left,
to
my
colleague.
