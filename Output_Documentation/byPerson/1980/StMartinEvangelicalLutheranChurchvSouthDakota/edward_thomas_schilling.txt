mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
suggest
that
the
primary
question
before
the
court
is
whether
churches
that
operate
elementary
and
secondary
schools
are
exempt
from
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
which
is
known
as
futa,
as
that
act
is
applied
by
the
states.
if
the
court
should
find
that
these
schools
are
not,
these
churches
are
not
exempt,
then
we
have
a
second
question,
and
that
is
whether
coverage
under
futa
would
violate
either
or
both
of
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
petitioners
are
st.
martin
evangelical
lutheran
church,
which
is
separately
incorporated
under
south
dakota
law,
and
it
operates
an
elementary
day
school.
the
other
petitioner,
northwestern
lutheran
academy,
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
wisconsin
synod,
and
it
is
a
four-year
preparatory
school
for
entrance
into
one
of
the
synod
colleges
in
preparation
for
either
the
teaching
or
the
preaching
ministry.
it
should
be
noted
that
all
teachers
are
regarded
as
ministers
of
the
wisconsin
synod.
this
was
found
by
the
appeals
referee
in
the
original
administrative
hearing.
they
have
equal
status
with
their
preaching
minister
counterparts
and
voting
rights
on
doctrinal
matters
in
the
church.
now,
neither
of
these
schools
that
we're
talking
about
are
separately
incorporated.
prior
to
1970
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act
did
not
cover
nonprofit
or
tax-exempt
organizations.
in
1970,
however,
congress
required
the
states
to
cover
nonprofit
corporations
and
when
it
did
this
it
created
a
section
3309(b)
which
specifically
exempted
from
coverage
certain
nonprofit
employers
or
services.
now,
the
first
section,
3309(b)(1)
has
two
parts,
the
subsection
(a)
which
exempts
those
in
the
employ
of
a
church,
convention,
or
association
of
churches;
and
subsection
(b)
exempts
those
in
the
employ
of
an
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes
and,
which
is
not
an
issue
here,
which
organization
is
operated,
supervised,
controlled,
or
principally
supported
by
a
church,
convention,
or
association
of
churches.
subsection
(2)
deals
with
their
ministers
and
members
of
religious
orders.
subsection
(3)
exempted
those
in
the
employ
of
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
the
other
exemptions
are
not
pertinent
to
our
case.
in
1976
congress
again
amended
futa
effective
in
1978,
requiring
primarily
coverage
of
state
and
local
employees,
agricultural
workers,
and
domestic
workers.
and
when
congress
did
this
it
eliminated
that
elementary
and
secondary
school
exclusion,
and
this
is
where
the
controversy
begins.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
think
that
third
exception
was--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--i
think
it
had
no
effect
on
parochial
schools.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
it
did
on
other
nonprofit
schools,
and
perhaps
it
had
an
effect
on
public
schools.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
our
position,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that
was
not
the
view
of
the
labor
department
after
repeal.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
well,
i
think,
before,
mr.
justice,
it
never
had
occasion
to
arise,
and
i
don't
think
the
secretary
of
labor--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--no,
you
don't
get
an
exemption,
the
exemption
is
automatic,
mr.
justice.
i
mean,
if--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--you
don't
apply
or
do
anything
to
get
it.
it's
there
and
you
use
it.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
correct.
well,
after
this
exemption,
this
elementary
and
secondary
school
exemption
was
removed;
it
seems
that
the
state
bases
its
argument
on
repeal
of
this
subsection
(3).
we
maintain
that
the
statute
as
it
remains
is
clear,
and
that
the
statute
controls,
and
that
legislative
history
or
intent
is
really
not
an
issue.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i'm
talking
about
the
south
dakota
statute,
which
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
the
south
dakota
statute
is
so
closely
interwoven
with
the
federal
statute,
and--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--well,
i
suggest,
mr.
justice,
that
it
does
not
because
the
penalties
to
the
states,
if
they
don't
comply,
are
so
severe--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--mr.
justice,
i
think--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction
of
course
is
there
with
the
constitutional
question
we've
raised,
but
i
think
the
court
also,
without
the
constitutional
question,
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
question,
because
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
state
statute
and
the
federal
statute.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
think
that's
correct,
yes;
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
we
think
this
court
has
power,
mr.
justice,
to
overrule
and
reverse
the
south
dakota
supreme
court--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--if
you
did
not
want
to
get
to
the
constitutional
question,
yes,
mr.
justice.
and
we
don't
really
think
you
have
to
get
to
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that
might
be
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
i
think
we'd
have
to
come
back
if
they
would
not
follow
or
wish--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--and
we'd
have
another
case.
because
we
do
have
the
constitutional
issue.
i
think
that
the
south
dakota
supreme
court's
interpretation
was
so
heavily
reliant
on
what
the
secretary
of
labor
suggests
and
so
heavily
reliant
on
what
the
federal
statute
said,
because
they
kept
using
the
3309
provisions,
that
i
still
think
that
that
would
be
our
position,
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
aside
from
the
constitutional
question.
but
our
position
under
the
statute,
whether
it
be
south
dakota
or
the
federal
statute,
is
that
these
churches
are
exempt
either
under
subsection
(a)
because
the
services
performed
are
in
the
employ
of
a
church,
convention,
or
association
of
churches.
we
also
think
they
might
be
exempt
under
subsection
(b)
because
the
services
are
for
an
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
our
argument
primarily
is
based
on
the
statute.
i
will
first
discuss
(a).
i
think
under
subsection
(a)
we
have
to
define
the
simple
language,
"service
performed
in
the
employ
of
a
church.
"
and
i
think
we
have
to
define
what
the
word
"church"
means.
now,
the
south
dakota
appeals
referee
defined
the
word
"church"
very
narrowly.
he
said
that
the
word
"church"
meant
an
individual
house
of
worship,
as
has
been
interpreted
to
him
to
mean
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
we
think
the
appeals
referee
is
wrong--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--and
the
department
of
labor
is
wrong,
because
a
building
can't
employ
somebody.
i
think
that
the
facts
show
that
the
school
operated
by
st.
martin
church
is
not
separately
incorporated,
it's
not
a
legal
entity,
the
members
of
the
church
congregation
control
its
operation;
and,
number
three,
the
school
is
completely
financed
by
the
church.
if
the
tax
is
going
to
be
paid,
it's
going
to
be
paid
by
the
church.
likewise
northwestern
lutheran
academy
is
not
separately
incorporated.
its
control
is
by
the
synod,
and
its
principal
source
of
support
is
from
the
synod.
if
you
look
at
the
common
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
"church"
it
refers
to
a
body
or
organization
of
religious
believers,
and
that's,
i
think,
the
definition
that
we
should
use.
i
think
it's
interesting
that
when
congress
recodified
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1954,
it
stated
that
the
term
should
be
all-inclusive,
and
should
be
interpreted
to
include
other
organizations
which
as
integral
parts
of
the
church
are
engaged
in
carrying
out
the
church's
functions,
whether
individually
incorporated
or
not.
i
think
there
are
two
excellent
briefs
by
the
catholic
conference
and
by
the
lutheran
church-missouri
synod
that
trace
some
of
the
legislative
history.
from
time
to
time
congress
has
used
these
same
words,
"church,
convention,
or
association
of
churches.
"
and
of
course
it's
our
position
that
when
congress
did
this
it
kept
the
same
meaning.
we
think
congress
intended
a
broad
and
a
general
meaning.
now,
when
congress
recodified
the
code
in
1954,
the
words
"or
religious
order"
were
also
in
the
statute
they
were
talking
about.
and
those
words
"or
religious
order"
were
deleted,
because
i
think
congress
thought
that
that
would
limit
and
confuse
this
broad
definition
that
they
intended.
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae
implies
that
church
schools
are
not
exempt
under
this
section
because
they're
not
a
church.
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue.
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
these
church
schools,
or
the
services
performed
in
these
church
schools
which
are
not
separately
incorporated,
are
performing
services
in
the
employ
of
the
church.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
school
is
a
basic
part
of
the
church's
mission.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
the
state
rules
of
education?
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
mr.
justice,
the
state
heretofore
has
not
really
enforced
their
certification
requirements,
their
attendance
requirements.
they
do
submit
attendance
information.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
they
do.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
not
sunday
school.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
well,
sunday
schools
are
not
a
requirement
of
compulsory
school
attendance.
but
a
day
school
is--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--i
meant,
insofar
as
the
inculcation
of
religious
doctrine
goes,
i
did.
insofar
as
state
requirements
of
education,
i
did
not.
i
think
this
question
of
state
requirements
and
certification
is
one
that
might
very
well
get
to
this
court
some
day.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
it
does.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
no,
they
could
not.
i
think
that
would
violate
the
establishment
clause.
this
question
of
certification
has
been
before
three
states,
these
requirements.
and
i
understand
that
ohio,
vermont,
and
kentucky
courts
have
restrained
the
states
from
enforcing
their
certification
requirements
on
parochial
schools.
i
understand--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
correct.
the
membership
are
the
churches.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
i
do
dispute
that
finding
the
referee
found
that
religion
is
inculcated
in
everything
they
teach,
but
then
he
said
that
the
primary
purpose
was
education.
the
word
"primary"
means
fundamentally,
in
the
first
place,
or
of
first
importance.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
reason
that
churches
provide
a
school
system
that's
contiguous
with
that
which
the
state
provides
is
strictly
to
inculcate
religious
beliefs.
insofar
as
the
wisconsin
synod
goes,
its
constitution
provides
for
conserving
its
doctrine
and
for
extending
its
doctrine,
and
its
constitution
specifically
provides
for
schools.
i
think
the
purpose
of
schools
insofar
as--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--they
do;
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that
is
correct.
their
function
beyond
that
is
to
inculcate
the
religious
doctrine
into
everything
they
teach,
and
i
think
that
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
establishment
cases
in
the
early
'70s.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
think
the
situation
insofar
as
roman
catholic
schools
or
baptist
schools
is
all
the
same.
i
think
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about,
if
we're
talking
about
the
federal
statute,
is
so
broad
that
no
matter
what
the
organizational
structure
of
the
church,
it's
covered
under
this
exemption.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
peculiar
about
the
wisconsin
synod.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
they're
not
restricted.
primarily
attendance
is
for
those
who
are
lutheran.
i
think
they
would
take--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--i
can't
speak
for
the
catholic
parochial
schools.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
well,
i
think
they're
pretty
similar,
insofar
as
their...
similar
insofar
as
their
inculcating
of
religious
doctrine.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
don't
think
the
fact--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--we
emphasized
the
fact
that
they
are
not,
because
in
our
case,
of
course,
we
have
that
fact.
but
i
think,
if
you
read
congress's
statement,
which
also
appears
in
the
conferee
statement
when
they
recodified
the
code,
they
used
the
term,
that
whether
they're
carrying
out
the
function
of
the
church,
where
there
are
separate
corporations
"or
otherwise".
so
i
think
under
this
broad
definition
of
church,
convention,
or
association
of
churches,
they
were
all-inclusive,
no
matter
what
the
organizational
structure
of
a
particular
religious
body
is.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
dispositive
question.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
why
are
they
covered?
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
elementary
schools
and
secondary
schools.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
think
their
freedom's--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--but
i
don't
think
their
purpose
in
college
is
primarily
religious,
that
is
for
most
church
colleges.
some,
that
may
be
true,
but
i
think
for
most
church
colleges--
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
--they're
included.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
they're
not
exempt.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
insofar
as
colleges,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
think,
since
1970.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
they
were
not
covered
before.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
because
they
were
a
nonprofit
corporation.
nonprofit
corporations
were
not
included
within
the
provisions.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
then
that
was
repealed
in
1970.
at
which
time
they
created
this
subsection
(3).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
they
were
never
exempt.
because
congress
did
not
provide
an
exemption
for
them
unless
they
could
come
in
under
(1);
they
could
come
in
as
primarily
religious.
i
think
congress,
when
it
spoke...
when
congress
came
out
in
the
'69-'70,
when
they
brought
these
various
nonprofit
organizations
in,
specifically
said
in
its
reports
that
a
separately
incorporated
organization
like
an
orphanage
or
a
home
for
the
aged
would
not
be
covered.
and
it
specifically
said
that,
in
these
reports,
that
institutions
of
higher
education
were
meant
to
be
covered
unless
they
were
seminaries
or
novitiates
or
something
like
that.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
think
our
exemption
would
still
come
back
under
3309(b)(1),
either
(a)
or
(b).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
under
subsection
(a)?
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
except
for
congress's
definition?
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
but
they're
in
the
employ
of
a
church.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
right.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
it
might
then
come
under
(1)(b).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
don't
think
so,
because
when
congress
defined
the
words
"church,
convention,
or
association
of
churches.
"
it
used
that
language,
"separate
corporation
or
otherwise"
in
its
definition.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
if
you'd
look
strictly
at
the
statute,
then
it
would
appear
that
separate
incorporated
schools
would
not
come
under
the
subsection
(a).
they
would
have
to
find
their
way
into
subsection
(b).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
stand
on
both.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
we're
standing
primarily
on
(a).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
and
(b).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
then
we'll
take
(b).
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
aside
from
this
constitutional
question,
that
might
be
the
answer,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
quite
possible,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that
might
be,
but
we
might
have
the
establishment
problem.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
right;
we
had
no
problem.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
and
(1)(b).
or
we
have
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
well,
with
respect
to
those
numbers,
all
i
can
say
is,
in
a
footnote
in
that
report,
there
was
a
bigger
number
of
261,000,
instead
of
the
242,000.
that
referred
to
teachers,
that
261,000.
and
if
we
would
then
bring
in
our
cafeteria
workers
and
our
bus
drivers
and
our
janitors
and
the
other
school
people,
that
number
would
grow.
so
i
have
trouble
relating
this
242,000
figure.
the
only
thing
i
have
to
go
on
is
what
happened
in
the
alabama
v.
marshall
conformity
hearing
where
the
administrative
law
judge
rejected
reliance
on
it
based
on
testimony
that
had
taken
place
in
that
matter,
that
there
was
no
record
that
congress
understood
that
figure
and
there
was
no
supporting
data
with
the
figure,
and
then
of
course
he
refused
to
go
along
with
it
because
the
issues
involved...
what
he
said...
were
integral
church
functions.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
yes,
but
the
primary
hearings
were,
all
involved
the
public
or
the
state
and
local
employees.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
mr.
justice,
never
in
the
congressional
record
or
debates
does
the
word
"church"
or
"church
employees"
appear.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
i
don't
know.
i
think
there
was
examination
of
people
in
that
alabama...
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
alabama
case.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
no.
there
was
no
discussion
on
that
figure.
mr.
edward
thomas
schilling
none
that
i
found,
mr.
justice.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time.
