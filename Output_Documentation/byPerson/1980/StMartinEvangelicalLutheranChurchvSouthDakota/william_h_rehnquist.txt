justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
south
dakota
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
has
construed
the
south
dakota
statute,
aren't
we
bound
by
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying,
then,
it's
like
the
zacchini
v.
scripps
case
we
decided
two
or
three
years
ago
where
we
felt
that
the
state
court
might
have
decided
this
case
differently
had
they
not
been
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
federal
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unless,
under
cases
like
zacchini
or
benguet
consolidated
mines,
we
were
to
vacate
and
remand
for
reconsideration
free
of
any
misapprehension
the
state
court
might
have
had
about
the
federal
law
question
involved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
teachers?
are
they
covered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
they
not
have
been
both
a
school
and
also
an
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes
before
(3)
was
repealed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
you're
saying
is
that
by
qualifying
as
a
school
they
would
have
come
under
(3)
if
it
were
still
in
existence.
but
that
doesn't
really
go
to
the
(1)(b)
question,
does
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
just
their
description
of
the
church.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
tracking
of
(1)(b),
isn't
it,
where
it
says,
an
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
teacher
in
a
parochial
school
who's
fired
for
teaching
doctrinally
wrong
religion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
most
statutes
remedial?
aren't
they
intended
to
remedy
something?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
beneficent
ones?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
beneficent
ones?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
secretary
take
the
position
that
an
employee
of
a
seminary,
religious
seminary,
is
not
within
(b),
(1)(b)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
staff
committee
presentation,
occur
at
a
hearing
considering
the
bill?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
whether
the
report
was
ever
made
known
to
the
congress
before
the
law
was
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
seminaries
are
schools,
and
yet
they
were
not
subject
to
the
coverage
of
the
act.
