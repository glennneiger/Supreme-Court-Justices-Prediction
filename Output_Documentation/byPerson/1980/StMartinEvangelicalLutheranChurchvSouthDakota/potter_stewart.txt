justice
stewart
that
question
bothered
me,
in
reading
the
briefs
in
this
case,
and
the
only
discussion
of
it
i
found
was
in
footnote
2
of
the
government's
amicus
brief
which
is
rather
short;
it
may
be
correct.
but
you
don't...
none
of
the
parties...
don't
discuss
that
question,
whether
or
not
this
doesn't
involve
purely
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
stewart
but
the
state
supreme
court
seemed
to
be
talking
about
the
south
dakota
law,
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
it
sets
it
out
on
page
a-3
of
its
opinion,
and
that's
the
one
it
discusses.
justice
stewart
well,
suppose
we
ruled
that
the
federal
law
didn't
intend
to
subject
religious
schools
to
this
tax?
suppose
we
just
ruled
that?
you
would
still
be
subject
to
them
in
south
dakota,
until
the
legislature
acted.
justice
stewart
well,
not
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
south
dakota
statute.
this
court
lacks
the
power
to
do
that.
justice
stewart
you
referred
to
the
synod,
and
according
to
your
brief
the
membership
of
the
synod
is
the
churches
themselves
rather
than
church
officials,
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
in
the
lutheran
organization?
justice
stewart
the
dictionary
meaning
includes
both.
justice
stewart
so
the
synod
is
an
assembly
or
a
group
of
lutheran
churches,
not
of
people?
justice
stewart
but,
certainly,
logically,
they
wouldn't
even
exist
if
they
didn't
have
some
function
beyond
that.
justice
stewart
and
i
gather
from
what
you've
just
said,
or
said
a
few
moments
ago,
that
you
don't
think
that
the
question
of
whether
the
church
is
a
separate
corporation
is
a
dispositive
question?
justice
stewart
in
this
case
they
are
not.
justice
stewart
i
say,
in
this
case
they
are
not,
and
you
rather
emphasized
that
in
your
statement
of
the
facts.
justice
stewart
so
even
though
something
were
incorporated
separately
as
a
school,
albeit
a
parochial
school,
that
would
not
be
a
dispositive
question
in
your
submission?
justice
stewart
right.
now,
(b)
is
something
else
again.
justice
stewart
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
statutory
definition:
"in
the
employ
of
(a)
a
church
or
convention
or
association
of
churches.
"
this
is
not
a
school.
justice
stewart
of
a
church,
and
your
clients
are,
you
tell
us.
justice
stewart
but
it
would
be
dispositive
of
whether
or
not
there
were
a
separate
corporation,
wouldn't
it?
and
if
the
employment
were
by
a
school,
then
(1)(a)
wouldn't
cover
it.
justice
stewart
it
might
or
might
not
come
under
(1)(b).
justice
stewart
so
the
corporate
organization
is
dispositive,
at
least
with
respect
to
(1)(a).
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
i'm
looking
at
the
statute,
which
is
what
congress
enacted.
and
the
exemption
is
for
somebody
in
the
employ
or
a
church
or
a
convention
or
association
of
churches.
justice
stewart
he
stands
on
both--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
employees
in
question
were
in
the
employ
of
a
church,
in
one
case,
or
an
association
of
churches
in
the
other,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
however
defined.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
could
be
employed
by
a
church
and
work
in
some
other
building,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
or
you
could
work
in
a
church
building
and
be
employed
by
somebody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
school
does,
likewise?
justice
stewart
in
any
event,
all
of
them
are
in
the
employ,
either
of
st.
martin
evangelical
lutheran
church,
on
the
one
hand,
in
the
one
case,
or
by
the
synod
in
the
other
case.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stewart
whether
they're
cafeteria
employees
or
janitors
or
lay
teachers
or
whatever?
justice
stewart
it's
always
what?
justice
stewart
but
you
would
concede,
i
gather,
that
a
cook
in
a
church,
which
everybody
agreed
was
a
church,
a
church
building,
would
be
exempt
under
(1)(a),
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
then,
you
do
not
concede
that
when
the
statute
exempts
people
in
the
employ
of
a
church,
that
it
exempts
janitors
in
the
employ
of
the
church?
justice
stewart
in
my
hypothetical
case,
he
sweeps
up
the
church
building.
justice
stewart
and
he's
employed
by
the
church,
and
only
by
the
church.
and
he
knows
it
and
there's
no
argument
otherwise.
justice
stewart
well,
am
i
right
in
reading
the
statute
in
this
way,
that
exemption
no.
(1),
both
(a)
and
(b),
depends
upon
the
identity
of
the
employer,
by
contrast
with
exemption
no.
(2),
which
depends
entirely
upon
the
identity
of
the
employee?
justice
stewart
and
am
i
further
correct
in
my
understanding
that
in
this
case
the
employer
is
in
the
one
case
a
church
and
in
the
other
an
association
of
churches?
justice
stewart
well,
the
school
itself
is
not
an
entity,
is
it?
it's
not
a
corporation?
isn't
the
employer
who
pays
the
wages
the
church,
in
the
one
case,
and
an
association
of
churches,
i.e.,
the
synod,
in
the
other?
justice
stewart
am
i
correct
in
that,
factually?
justice
stewart
don't
they
literally
fall
within
(1)(a)?
justice
stewart
literally?
justice
stewart
maybe
we
differ
as
to
our
understanding
of
the
word
"employment"
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
employer
is
the
person
who
pays
your
salary
or
wages.
justice
stewart
"in
the
employ
of".
so
it's
the
identity
of
the
employer,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
"in
the
employ
of".
and
the
test
in
(1)
is
the
identify
of
the
employer,
by
contrast
with
the
test
in
(2),
which
is
the
identity
of
the
employee.
justice
stewart
so
it
doesn't
fall
under
(b),
because
it's
not
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
justice
stewart
but
that
would
be
the
employer,
in
your
hypothetical
case.
and
isn't
that
the
statutory
test?
the
identity
of
the
employer,
whatever
the
nature
of
the
employee's
duties,
under
(1)?
justice
stewart
if,
as
i
understood
you
to
agree
with
me,
the
test
under
(1)
is
the
identity
of
the
employer,
then
the
employer
is
the
church,
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes,
isn't
it,
and
as
in
any
church--
justice
stewart
well,
what
percentage
is
covered
by
it
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
whether
it's
98
or
97.
justice
stewart
but
the
decision
in
this
case
will
bear
on
what
percentage
is
covered
by
it.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
true
about
section
(2),
that
is,
what
is
your...
what
are
you?
are
you
a
minister
of
a
church?
but
the
inquiry
in
number
(1)
is,
who
are
you
employed
by?
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
number
(1)
doesn't
ask
at
all,
what
are
your
duties?
but
who
are
you
employed
by?
and
number
(2),
on
the
other
hand,
asks
exclusively,
what
do
you
do?
justice
stewart
according
to
the
secretary,
does
a
person,
in
order
to
be
exempt
from
the
unemployment
tax
act,
have
to
be
not
only
employed
by
that
house
of
worship
but
carry
out
his
duties
in
that
house
of
worship,
his
employment
duties?
justice
stewart
no,
in
most
cases
that
question
perhaps
needn't
be
asked,
but
i'm
asking
it.
not
for
most
cases,
but
what's
the
secretary's
point
of
view?
justice
stewart
well,
he
both
has
to
be
employed
by...
that
is
his
salary
has
to
be
paid
by
the
house
of
worship,
and
his
employment
duties
have
to
be
within
the
house
of
worship,
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
it
seems
to
me
it
would
exclude
people
who
are
literally
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
because
of
(1)(b)?
justice
stewart
the
(1)(a)
and
(b)
simply
inquires,
who
are
you
employed
by?
i
thought
you
had
agreed
with
that.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
it's
self-explanatory.
justice
stewart
and
that's
a
very
bright
line.
