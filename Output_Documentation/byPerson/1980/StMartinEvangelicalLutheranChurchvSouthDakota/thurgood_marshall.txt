thurgood
marshall
is
it
governed
by
state
rules?
does
it
follow
the
state
rules
for
education?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
supervise
those
schools?
do
they
enforce
the
attendance
laws?
does
the
state
enforce
the
attendance
laws?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
do
that
for
your
church
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
sunday
school?
do
that
for
your
sunday
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
you
don't,
so
they're
different,
aren't
they?
aren't
they
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
you
said
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
it
was
just
the
same
as
the
sunday
school.
you
didn't
really
mean
that,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
not,
under
the
religion
clauses,
compel
attendance
at
a
sunday
school.
the
state
of
south
dakota
couldn't
compel
people
to
go
to
sunday
school,
could
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
these
schools
restricted
to
lutheran
children,
or
can
other
children
attend?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
true
in
the
catholic
parochial
schools,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
just
a
minute
ago,
you
did
say
they
were
similar,
though.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
this
also
apply
to
a
church
hospital?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
there
possibly
would
be
one
that
wasn't
incorporated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
church,
i'm
talking
about
st.
isaac's
hospital
that's
three
blocks
away
from
the
church
but
it's
owned
by
the
church.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say...
you
charged
on;
i
told
you
the
facts.
is
it
a
part
or
not
a
part?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
paid
by
the--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--they
are
paid
by
the
hospital
but
the
money
comes
from
the
church?
justice
thurgood
marshall
general,
that's
the
point
i
want.
in
declaring
these
teachers
as
ministers,
does
the
state
consider
that
they're
ministers
for
income
tax
purposes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
considered
that
for
federal
income
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
that
applied,
of
course
that'd
apply
to
this
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
general,
how
come
is
it
impossible
for
a
school
to
be
an
"organization"?
why
can't
it
be
an
organization?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
any
other
"organization"
of
a
church
that
would
have
to
comply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
school
is
the
only
one
that
wouldn't
be,
is
the
only
organization
that
wouldn't
be
included.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
in
trouble
with
school
not
being
an
organization.
i
think
it
could
be
an
organization.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
primary
purpose
of
a
school
is
education.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
say
there's
another
one;
it's
religion.
if
they
wanted
just
education,
they'd
send
them
to
public
schools.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
can't
escape
that.
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
get
too
carried
away
with
this
building,
please.
because
i
know
of
a
church
in
washington
that
up
to
a
few
years
ago
met
in
hogate's
restaurant.
so
don't
get
too
hooked
up
on
that
building.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
in
our
church
we
called
him
a
sexton,
and
you'd
better
not
call
him
a
janitor.
