mr.
allen
r.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
amici
curiae,
the
states
of
alabama
and
nevada,
submit
that
in
order
to
resolve
this
case
the
court
need
look
no
further
than
the
plain
language
of
26
u.s.c.
section
3309(b)(1),
subsection
(a).
the
uncontradicted
facts
before
this
court
demonstrate
that
employees
of
church
schools
such
as
petitioners
are
"in
the
employ
of
a
church,
or
convention,
or
association
of
churches.
"
and
thus
fit
squarely
within
the
statutory
exemption
provided
by
congress.
the
question
that
was
raised
earlier
concerning
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
or
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
the
statutory
interpretation
here,
i
think
is
answered
by
two
factors.
number
one,
a
review
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
decision
makes
it
clear
they
are
relying
solely
on
their
understanding
of
congressional
intent
and
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
they
state
at
page
a-5
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
in
the
opinion
there,
"the
threshold
issue
is
congressional
intent.
"
and
i
think
the
language
of
that
opinion
is
clear,
that
they
are
relying
on
their
understanding
of
the
secretary
of
labor's
interpretation
and
of
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute.
under
those
circumstances,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
from
this
court
that
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
erroneous
understanding
of
federal
law
which
is
introduced
into
a
state
court
decision
is
properly
the
subject
of
federal
review
even
though
the
state
court
could
choose
voluntarily
to
read
its
own
statute
differently;
where
it
states
that
it
is
relying
on
its
understanding
of
federal
law,
this
court
can
correct
such
a
misapprehension.
i
think
one
of
the
best
cases
for
that
proposition
is
standard
oil
company
v.
johnson,
which
is
cited
at
316
us
481.
at
page
483
the
court
makes
it
quite
clear
that
it
will
review
an
interpretation
of
the
california
highway
tax,
because
the
california
court
interpreted
that
tax
by
reference
to
its
understanding
of
federal
law
concerning
the
definition
of
an
agency
or
a
part
of
the
united
states
government.
we
think,
equally
here,
the
state
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
federal
law,
and
it
has
interpreted
it
incorrectly.
in
considering
whether
church
school
employees
are
employed
by
a
church
as
required
for
the
(b)(1)(a)
exemption,
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
statute
and
the
implementing
regulations
expressly
define
the
words
"employer"
and
"employee",
and
they
define
them
so
as
to
incorporate
into
the
unemployment
compensation
law
the
common
law
rules
for
determining
whether
an
employer-employee
relationship
exists.
they
set
forth
such
factors
as
the
right
to
control
and
direct
the
individual's
work,
the
furnishing
of
the
place
or
tools
of
the
work,
and
the
right
to
discharge
the
individual.
in
this
case,
as
counsel
for
petitioners
has
already
indicated,
the
church
schools
involved
are
run
directly
by
the
church
or
the
synod.
they
have
no
separate
corporate
or
legal
existence,
and
therefore
these
schools
are
typical
of
the
great
variety
of
schools
that
are
described
in
the
stipulated
record
which
is
before
this
court
in
marshall
v.
alabama
and
nevada,
no.
8922.
while
those
stipulations
by
the
secretary
of
labor
are
not
binding
on
the
parties
here,
we
believe
they
are
helpful
in
understanding
the
position
of
the
department
of
labor,
which
position
was
then
adopted
by
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
in
the
decision
that's
under
review.
the
secretary
has
stipulated
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
our
states
all
of
the
catholic,
lutheran,
and
fundamental
baptist
church
schools
have
no
legal
existence
separate
from
their
respective
churches.
in
those
schools
church
officials
such
as
the
pastor
or
the
priest
hire
and
fire
all
the
employees
of
the
school.
church
officials
discipline
and
control
the
work
of
the
employees.
the
church
owns
the
building
in
which
the
school
operates.
the
employees'
salaries
are
paid
directly
from
the
church
bank
account.
therefore
we
believe
it
is
uncontradicted
that
every
key
element
of
the
common
law
definition
of
employment
as
incorporated
into
this
statutory
scheme
is
present
here.
nevertheless,
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
suggest
that
the
word
"church"
should
be
confined
to
mean
the
physical
house
of
worship
rather
than
the
legal
entity
that
owns
the
building
and
hires
the
employees.
as
is
set
forth
at
some
length
in
the
briefs
in
this
case,
congress
has
consistently
provided
for
a
broader
definition
of
"church"
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no,
sir,
i
think
you'd
normally--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--mr.
justice
white,
i
think
normally--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
does
depend--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
think
it
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
depends
somewhat
on
the
context
in
which
you're
speaking.
if
someone
says
on
sunday,
i'm
going
to
church,
they
may
perhaps
be
talking
about
the
building
or
they
may
be
talking
about
the
worship
service.
but
congress
used
the
word
"in
the
employ
of
the
church.
"
and
we
submit
that
a
church
building
cannot
employ
anyone,
that
in
the
context
of
who
is
the
employer,
when
congress
is
setting
out
a
statute
about
the
payment
of
wages,
about
the
withholding
of
taxes,
that
the
phrase,
in
that
context,
we
submit,
had
to
refer
to
the
definition
as
petitioners'
counsel
has
stated.
that
is
also
a
common
definition
of
"church",
which
is
the
body
of
believers,
the
legal
entity.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
the
secretary
defines
the
word
to
mean
the
building.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
can
define
the
statute
with
that
definition.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
perhaps
that's
their
point.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
we
submit
that
in
this
context
the
word
"church"
must
include
the
legal
entity
that
controls
the
building
and
that
hires
and
fires
the
employees.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that
is
exactly--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
don't
believe
it
is.
i
think
even
under
the
secretary's
interpretation
many
of
these
schools
since
they
are
in
the
same
building
perhaps
would
be
exempt.
but
we
submit
that
reliance
upon
what
building
the
school
is
in
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
we
think
that
were
congress
to
find
"employer"
in
this
statute
as
a
person
who
pays
wages,
then
in
the
same
statute,
when
they
use
the
phrase,
"in
the
employ
of
a
church.
"
we
submit
they
must
have
meant
"church"
to
mean
the
legal
entity
that
pays
wages,
the
association,
the
corporation.
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
employing
entities
within
the
meaning
of
that
legislative
language.
we
urge
this
court
to
reject
the
strained
and
contorted
reading
of
the
statutory
language--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
all
church
hospitals
are
separately
incorporated.
and
under
our
reading
of
the
statute--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--if,
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
the
hospital
were
part
of
the
church
itself,
were
not
separately
incorporated--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--if
it
is
part
of
the
church,
not
a
separate
corporation,
then
the
literal
language--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--what
i
mean
to
suggest,
mr.
justice,
is
that
if
the
employees
of
that
hospital
are
employed
by
the
church
entity,
as
in
this
case,
their
salaries
paid--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--from
the
church
account.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
if
the
hospital
has
a
separate
legal
identity,
in
other
words,
a
separate
bank
account,
a
separate
association,
corporation,
or
structure,
then
we
think
that
it
would
not
fit
within
the
language
of
(b)(1)(a).
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
think
that
a
separately
incorporated
school
would
in
most
instances
be
exempt
under
(b)(1)(b),
but
would
not
fit
(b)(1)(a)
language,
as
petitioners
do
here.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that's
only
true,
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
you
focus
on
private
schools.
and
in
fact,
that
language
which
you
just
quoted
was
directly
in
the
context
of
a
lengthy
discussion
of
state
and
public
schools,
which
was
the
primary
purpose
of
this
statute.
there
was
no
reference
in
that
whole
discussion
from
which
the
quotation
is
taken
about
private
schools
at
all,
much
less
church
schools.
in
fact,
the
words
242,000
figure
that
was
referred
to
earlier
is
simply
a
figure
in
a
table,
in
a
report,
opposite
the
phrase,
"nonprofit
organizations".
there
is
no
discussion
of
that
figure
as
to
what
is
included
within
that
number,
what
type
of
nonprofit
organizations,
and
the
record
in
the
alabama-nevada
case--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
agree,
the
great
majority
of
nonprofit
private
schools
are
parochial
schools
but
the
phrase,
nonprofit
schools,
was
not
in
the
language
that
you
quoted,
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
simply
said,
"all
educational
institutions".
the
public
schools,
of
course,
are
the
vast
preponderance
of
those,
and
were
being
discussed
in
that
section
of
the
legislative
history.
thank
you
very
much.
