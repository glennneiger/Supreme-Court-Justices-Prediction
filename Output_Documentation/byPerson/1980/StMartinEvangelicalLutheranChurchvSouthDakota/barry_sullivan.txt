mr.
barry
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
until
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
arose
and
addressed
the
question
of
the
coverage
of
the
statute
that's
involved
here,
i
had
not
heard
a
word
today
about
the
purposes
for
which
the
statute
that
is
being
construed,
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
was
enacted
by
congress.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
remedial
statute.
and
that's
perhaps
the
beginning
of
any
statutory
construction.
but
it's
not
simply
a
remedial
statute--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
that's
always
bothered
me,
about
how
you
distinguish
among
remedial
statutes.
mr.
barry
sullivan
pardon?
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
here,
as
this
court
has
said
in
california
department
of
human
resources
v.
java,
we
have
a
very
special
kind
of
remedial
statute.
we
have
a
statute
that
goes
to
the
very
subsistence
of
individual
citizens.
this
statute
was
informed
by
the
experience
of
the
great
depression
and
has
played
a
vital
role
in
our
society
since
that
time.
it
was
understood
by
congress
that
people
in
the
time
of
the
great
depression
suffered
unemployment,
and
the
result
of
this
unemployment,
after
a
protracted
time,
was
that
they
were
forced
to
accept
charity.
this
statute
represents
a
judgment
of
our
society
that
people
should
not
have
to
accept
charity,
that
they
should
be
able
to
participate
in
an
insurance
scheme
whereby
they
can
work
and
earn
benefits
for
the
day
when
they
may
become
unemployed.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
barry
sullivan
and,
in
fact,
98
percent
of
the
work
force
is
now
covered
by
this
statute
as
a
result
of
the
amendments--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
i
think
that
the
number
of
workers
that
are
involved
in--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
right.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
between
97
or
98
or
98-99,
which
is
why--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
right.
and
the
people
who
are
exempted
are
exempted
for
specific
reasons.
ministers
are
exempted
because
of
the
problems
that
may
arise
in
the
case
of
ministers,
also
for
the
reason
that
ministers
generally
aren't
laid
off
but
belong
to
a
church
who
continue
to
employ
them
and
may
not
suffer
the
same--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
right,
mr.
justice.
and
i'm
reaching
and
i
will
reach
that.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
think
i
might
subscribe
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
slight
differentiation
in
the
way
he
has
put
that,
because
i
have
the
sense
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
me,
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
distinction.
however,
i
think
in
construing
this
particular
statute,
something
has
been
overlooked
here.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
what
needs
to
be
pointed
out
here
is
that
this
construction
of
"church",
first
of
all,
is
not
as
irrational
as
it
sounds
on
its
face
when
put
in
the
argument
that
a
building
can
employ
anybody.
the
construction
the
secretary
has
given
to
it
is
as
a
house
of
worship,
meaning
the
core
religious,
establishment,
and
in
that
sense--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
i
would
think
that
in
most
cases--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
i
think
that
it
would
be,
that
the
person--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--no,
that's
not
it.
because
that
would
exclude,
obviously--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
correct,
and
i
would
say
that
the
source,
the
analogy
on
which
the
secretary
is
relying
here,
is
the
similar
problem
that's
been
worked
out
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cases,
where
we
have,
the
statutory
language
says,
employed
by
an
establishment.
mr.
barry
sullivan
the
establishment,
in
that
case,
refers
to
a
physical
or
geographical
location
from
which
a
person
may
go
out
to
work
in
some
other
place,
but
where
he
is
based.
and
in
that
case,
the
establishment
may
be
the
local
office
of
general
motors
and
his
employer
may
be
general
motors,
but
he
is
employed
by
the
establishment
for
the
purposes
of
the
act,
and
employed
by
the
church,
we
submit,
has
a
similar
meaning
in
this
statute.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
would
assume
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
hogate's
restaurant
paid
the
janitor,
and
that
consequently
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem
for
purposes
of
this
statute.
mr.
barry
sullivan
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
about
the
secretary's
construction
of
the
first
exemption
is
that
this
exemption
is
not
something,
that
this
construction
is
not
something
that
the
secretary
has
dreamed
up
out
of
whole
cloth
as
a
result
of
these
amendments.
this
is
an
exemption,
this
exemption
as
construed,
was
construed
by
the
secretary
in
1970
at
the
time
that
nonprofit
organizations
became
subject
to
the
act
and
it's
not
a
recent
development.
congress
amended
the
act
in
1976
knowing
that
this
is
the
way
the
secretary
of
labor
had
construed
the
act.
mr.
barry
sullivan
the
secretary's
position
is
that
any
employee
of
a
religious
seminary
would
not
be
subject
to
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
and
that
is,
i
think,
based
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendments.
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
1974
congress
provided
in
another
statute
for
the
coverage
of
the
same
people
who
are
being
covered
here,
and
consequently
petitioners'
argument
asked
the
court
to
believe
not
only
that
congress
was
unaware
of
what
the
secretary's
construction
of
the
exemptions
had
been,
but
also
that
congress,
without
saying
a
word,
intended
to
withdraw
coverage
that
it
had
already
provided.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
quite
an
assumption,
given
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
third,
petitioners'
argument
asks
that
the
court
believe
that
congress
was
simply
in
error
as
to
the
number
of
people
who
would
be
covered
by
this
statute.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
before
lunch
the
statement
was
made
that
in
this
chart
that
the
senate
finance
committee,
i
believe,
staff
prepared,
that
it
simply
said,
242,000
employees>
["]
against
the
category,
"nonprofit
organizations".
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
makes
perfect
sense
because
of
all
nonprofit
organizations,
and
the
various
ways
that
they
could
have
their
coverage
changed.
it
was
only
schools
that
were
in
issue
at
that
time,
and
so
that
all
of
those
employees
had
to
be
school
employees.
and
if
that
figure
did
not
cover
parochial
school
employees,
it
would
naturally
be
much,
much
lower.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
testimony.
it's
part
of
the...
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
and
it's
a
report
of
the
senate
committee.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that,
although
i
have
no
reason
to
assume
that
it
wasn't
made
available
to
congress.
it's
not
something
that
was
published
after
the
fact.
i
would
finally
like
to
point
out
that
both
congress
and
the
secretary
have
seen
the
need
here
for
a
bright
line
test.
i
think
the
need
has
been
pointed
out
adequately,
that
a
very
subjective
inquiry
would
be
necessitated
by
reading
the
(b)
exemption
of
the
statute
as
applicable
to
parochial
schools.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think
that--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
the
problem
is
this.
there's
been
a
lot
of--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
parochial
schools
as
if
they
were
marbles,
and
that
they
were
all
alike.
and
the
question
was
asked
this
morning,
are
all
church
schools
organized
in
the
same
way?
and
the
answer
was,
yes.
well,
i
defy
anybody
to
produce
evidence
for
me
that
all
denominations
organize
their
church
schools
in
the
same
way.
to
make
an
organization's
exemption
depend
on
whether
the
particular
doctrines
which
the
organization
espouses
allow
it
to
incorporate
is
ludicrous.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
was
concerned
with,
it's
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
secretary
has
adopted
the
construction
that
he
has,
to
say
that
schools
are
schools,
and
they're
going
to
be
subject
to
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
barry
sullivan
and
sunday
schools
are
schools,
and
they're
not
subject
to
the
act.
and
we
would
say
that
that
is
the
proper
analogy.
mr.
barry
sullivan
again,
i
cannot
speak
authoritatively
to
that.
i
wouldn't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
would
just
close
with
one
example
that
follows
up
on
something
that
the
chief
justice
said
this
morning.
and
that
is,
suppose
that
we
have
an
archdiocesan,
a
school
owned
by
the
archbishop
of
washington
in
the
city
of
washington,
and
he
decides
that
he
will
close
all
archdiocesan
schools
where
the
enrollment
falls
below
200
student
for
three
years
running.
the
parents
in
this
parish
decide
that
they
want
to
maintain
a
parochial
school
for
their
children
and
they
go
to
the
archbishop
and
they
say,
if
you
give
us
the
building
we
will
run
the
school.
they
incorporate,
they
run
the
school,
they
continue
to
have
the
same
teachers--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
question.
i
think
that
the
type
of
legislation
that
we
have
here
is
of
the
same
order
of
requiring
schools
to
have
fire
alarm
systems.
i
think
that
under
the
guidelines,
the
dicta
in
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters,
this
is
the
kind
of
concern
that
the
state
can
rightly
have
about
religious
schools.
thank
you.
