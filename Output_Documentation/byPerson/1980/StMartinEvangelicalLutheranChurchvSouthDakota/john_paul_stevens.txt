paul

mr.
schilling,
maybe
i'm
laboring
the
point,
but
the
referee
found,
as
i
remember,
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
school
was
education
rather
than
religious
training.
do
you
dispute
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
schools
do
perform
the
same
educational
function
that
public
schools
do
insofar
as
the
general
education
that
is
needed
by
a
child,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schilling,
insofar
as
you
rely
on
(b),
and
of
course
i
understand
you
disagree
with
the
referee's
characterization
as
to
"operated
primarily
for
educational
purposes",
but
would
it
not
be
necessary
in
every
case
involving
a
church-affiliated
school,
for
the
taxing
authorities
to
make
it
an
ad
hoc
decision
as
to
whether
that
particular
school
was
primarily
for
religious
purposes
or
primarily
for
educational
purposes,
rather
than
having
a
general
rule
that
would
cover
all
schools.
i
meant,
all
nonpublic
schools;
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
might
be
a
large
number
of
individual
determinations
that
would
have
to
be
made
in
order
to
determine
the
scope
of
(1)(b).
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
just
on
one
thing
that's
mentioned
in
the
opinion
below.
it's
the
number
of
employees
that
congress
thought
it
was
subjecting
to
the
statute.
they
used
a
figure
that
your
opponents
argue
demonstrates
they
must
have
been
intending
to
include
the
employees
of
parochial
schools
generally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
with
regard
to
the
legislative
history,
in
the
house
report
that
the
government
quotes
on
page
10
in
their
brief,
it's
stated
that
section
115(b)
also
has
the
effect
of
requiring
the
state
to
pay
unemployment
compensation
on
the
basis
of
services
performed,
for
all
educational
institutions.
do
you
think
they
really
didn't
mean
that?
86
percent,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
schools
involved
are
church-affiliated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
normally
when
one,
just
as
you
say,
when
you
work
for
a
school
or
a
church,
the
same
sort
of
question,
when
you
talk
about
private
schools,
private
secondary
schools,
for
the
most
part
you
are
encompassing
within
that
concept
a
very
large
number
of
parochial
schools,
aren't
you?
do
you
think
that
when
one
just
talks
about
private
schools,
he
intends
to
refer
to
nonreligious
private
schools?
just
in
terms
of
ordinary
meaning,
as
used
in
everyday
parlance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
"wages"
refer
to
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
"services
performed
in
the
employ
of.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
read
it
the
way
you're
doing
it
now.
and
a
church
is
certainly
an
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
say
they're
in
the
employ
of
a
church,
they
also
are
in
the
employ
of
an
organization
which
is
operated
primarily
for
religious
purposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
that
(1)
does
not
refer
to
the
employer,
it
refers
to
the
nature
of
the
services.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(1)
doesn't
refer
to
the
employer.
it
refers
to
the
nature
of
the
services.
well,
any
services
that
include
services
performed
in
the
employ
of.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
more
question,
if
i
may.
you
refer
to
the
janitor.
i
think
very
frequently
in
these
establishments
the
same
janitor
will
sweep
out
the
church
and
the
school.
is
he
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you'd
read
the
laundry
case
of
a
few
days
ago
you'd
find
that
it's
a
very
dangerous
thing
on
which
to
rely.
