justice
rehnquist
if
it
wasn't
appealable,
then
we
don't
ever
get
to
the
second
question?
justice
rehnquist
--why
was
it
any
concern
of
firestone's?
justice
rehnquist
well,
let's
assume
firestone,
for
a
moment,
doesn't
represent
the
public
interest
but
just
itself.
why
is
it
that
firestone
would
suffer
if
he
were
not
disqualified?
justice
rehnquist
would
the
options
open
to
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
as
to
insurability
or
not,
affect
recovery
against
firestone?
justice
rehnquist
your
answer
is
basically
that
firestone
might
have
to
pay
a
greater
or
lesser
amount
depending
on
how
much
insurability
there
was
in
its
policy
with
home,
is
that
correct?
justice
rehnquist
is
home
fire
firestone's
excess
insurer--
justice
rehnquist
you
would
come
out
differently,
then,
on
the
appealability
of
an
order
disqualifying
a
lawyer,
because
there
would
be
no
finality
under
cohen?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
lack
the
finality
element
in
cohen,
in
an
order
granting
disqualification,
don't
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
someone
who
might
be
sitting
in
a
courtroom
at
this
hearing,
in
the
spectator's
part,
could
get
up
and
move
for
disqualification
of
one
of
the
attorneys
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest?
justice
rehnquist
no,
that
wasn't
the
question.
the
question
was
whether
a
lay
person
who
presumably
has
as
much
interest
in
the
public
interest
being
enforced
as
attorneys
do
could
get
up
and
move
for
disqualification
of
one
of
the
attorneys
to
the
case
being
heard
on
the
grounds
of
conflict
of
interest?
justice
rehnquist
we
never
get
to
any
of
this
if
we
find
that
the
order
refusing
to
disqualify
was
not
appealable,
do
we?
justice
rehnquist
we
never
get
to
this
conflict
situation
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
order
refusing
to
disqualify
risjord
was
not
appealable?
justice
rehnquist
well,
don't
all
lawyers
use
tactical
and
strategic
weapons
in
trying
to
beat
their
opponents?
justice
rehnquist
as
an
element
necessary
for
certification,
you
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
a
probably
dispositive
issue
in
the
case,
don't
you?
justice
rehnquist
how
could
you
ever
say
that
the
disqualification
of
a
lawyer
was
a
probably
dispositive
issue
in
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
have
they
answered
the
question
that
i
just
put
to
you?
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
is
a
troublesome
point
for
me
because
in
both
the
recent
2nd
circuit
case
here
and
the
8th
circuit
here
they
first
hold
the
order
as
nonappealable,
and
then
they
go
ahead
and
decide
it.
