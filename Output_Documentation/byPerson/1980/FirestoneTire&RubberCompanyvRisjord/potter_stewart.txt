justice
stewart
mr.
grossman,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
to
ask
you
a
question
that
doesn't
really
go
to
the
merits
of
this
case
at
all?
in
the
respondent's
brief
i
notice
on
page
2
the
second
very
short,
one-sentence
paragraph
said
that,
"risjord
has
filed
complaints
on
behalf
of
a
plaintiff
against
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company,
alleging
identical
claims.
"
now,
would
a
judge
who
had
an
interest,
legal
or
equitable,
in
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company,
should
such
a
judge
consider
disqualifying
himself
from
this
litigation?
justice
stewart
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company.
justice
stewart
was
or
is
the
insurance
carrier
for
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company,
home?
justice
stewart
and
it's
not
a
part
of
this
litigation,
i
know.
justice
stewart
perhaps
your
brother
will
be
able
to
answer
my
question.
but
so
far
as
you're
concerned,
you
see
no--
justice
stewart
mr.
gibson,
is
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company
tangentially
involved
in
this
case?
justice
stewart
who
is
their
insurance
carrier?
justice
stewart
and
you
don't
know,
personally?
