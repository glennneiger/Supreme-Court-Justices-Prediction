justice
white
is
the
trend
the
same
way
with
respect
to
orders
granting
disqualification?
justice
white
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is,
yes?
the
trend
generally
is
to
treat
them
both...
is
not...
no,
it's
no?
to
treat
them
differently?
justice
white
was
there
any
discussion
in
the
trial
court
when
this
question
came
up
as
to
whether
the
judge
ought
to
entertain
this
suggestion
on
behalf
of
firestone?
justice
white
no,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
objection
ought
to
be
heard
at
all?
what
interest
did
the
objector
have
in
it?
did
the
judge
feel
that
there
was
really
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
white
i
know
you
do.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
understand;
that's
your
position
now.
but
was
that
position
expressed
in
the
trial
court?
justice
white
the
trial
judge
must
have
thought
it
was
a
suggestion
that
deserved
ruling
on?
justice
white
i'd
like
to
know.
i
wondered,
if
it
were
raised
there--
justice
white
--i
suppose
the
transcript
would
show
what
the
discussion
was?
