mr.
john
r.
gibson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
firestone,
that
has
never
been
a
client
of
risjord's,
seeks
his
disqualification.
this
case
involves
no
question
of
breach
of
confidential
information.
that
admission
is
made
abundantly
clear
in
the
reply
brief
filed
by
firestone
in
this
case.
the
only
question
relating
to
conflict
is
that...
and
again,
it
is
speculating
what
might
be...
that
risjord
in
representing
these
plaintiffs
could
guide
or
fashion
the
case
in
such
a
way
that
would
be
harmful
to
firestone
and
helpful
to
home.
now,
this
assumption
is
based
on
this
factual
situation,
and
it
is
one
in
which
the
complete
story
has
not
yet
come
out.
firestone
is
saying
that
the
risjord
theory
is
based
on
what
he
continuously
refers
to
in
his
brief
as
a
highly
unusual
intentional
tort
theory,
and
that
home
has
denied
coverage
for
this
theory.
now,
what
is
not
said
is
that
risjord
has
also
pleaded
counts
in
negligence
and
counts
in
defective
products
under
restatement
402(a),
alternative
counts.
he
has
also
pleaded,
as
was
brought
out
a
minute
ago,
these
same
theories
against
other
defendants,
goodyear,
budd,
kelsey-hayes,
and
we
simply
don't
know
who
has
their
coverage.
there
has
certainly
been
no
record
made
in
this
case
that
home
has
anything
to
do
with
those
parties.
now,
the
fallacy;
not
only
has
there
been
this
lack
of
disclosure
of
this
information,
but
the
fallacy
that
mr.
grossman,
that
firestone
must
face,
is
this...
and
i
think
the
district
judge
knew
when
he
heard
the
motion
for
disqualification,
the
common
practice
in
products
cases,
in
most
litigation,
is
that
the
plaintiff's
attorney
is
going
to
submit
all
of
the
evidence
he
has,
he's
going
to
submit
his
cases
in
the
alternative,
and
the
jury
then
or
the
judge
will
determine
what
the
basis
of
liability
is
going
to
be.
so
it
is
an
alternative
submission
which
is
undoubtedly
what
we're
going
to
have
in
this
case,
not
simply
a
guiding
and
fashioning
and
a
pursuing
of
one
theory
and
an
abandoning
of
the
other
theories.
that
simply
isn't
the
practicality
of
what
is
going
to
happen.
now,
the
real
conflict,
as
has
been
observed,
is
between
firestone
and
its
insurer
home.
and
there
is
a
lawsuit
that
has
been
filed
that
raises
that
particular
question.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
the
first
part
of
your
question?
mr.
john
r.
gibson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
this
court
decides
this
case
is
not
appealable,
in
the
recent
case
of
coopers
&
lybrand,
which
was
decided
in
1978,
the
court
found
that
the
death
knell
doctrine
didn't
apply,
the
cohen
doctrine
didn't
apply,
there
was
no
appeal,
and
you
don't
get
to
this
whole
question
of
conflict
and
consent,
which
is
tied
in
with
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
simply
isn't
necessary
to
go
that
far.
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
gone
the
next
step
and
decided
that
question.
some
of
them
haven't.
but
certainly
there
is
no
need
to
do
this.
but
all
of
these
facts
were
before
the
district
judge,
when
he
made
his
order
in
this
case,
and
following
that
he
fashioned
the
remedy
of
either
withdrawal
from
representation
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
clients,
or
obtaining
consents.
risjord
first
obtained
those
consents
from
the
plaintiffs
and
from
home
and
then,
following
that,
risjord
was
asked
to
withdraw
by
home,
and
he
did
withdraw,
and
following
that,
that
case,
that
one
case
was
the
one
case
that
risjord
had
represented
home
in
for
about
a
10-year
period.
we
have
the
deeply
rooted
argument,
we
have
the
martindale-hubbell
listing.
there
is
no
question
that
they'd
been
listed
as
a
client
in
martindale-hubbell.
but
the
facts
are
that
risjord
had
represented
home
in
that
one
fire
case,
and
they
were
simply
one
of
six
insurers
and
home
had
10
percent
of
the
risk.
and
the
case
was
referred
to
him
by
an
independent
adjuster.
that's
not
the
real
nature
of--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
mr.
risjord
in
his
testimony,
in
his
deposition
that
he
gave,
said
that
he
had
tried
to
get
a
change
made,
he
had
suggested
to
them
repeatedly
that
they
alphabetize
it,
and
he
finally
just
gave
up
on
it.
they
just
wouldn't
do
it.
they
were
certain
that--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--martindale
just
simply
would
not
alphabetize
it
for
him,
and
he
simply
gave
up
after
repeated
requests.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
that
is
his
testimony,
that
he
could
not
get
them
to
alphabetize
it.
and
that's
in
the
record
in
the
case.
but
the
question...
and
i
might
say,
of
course,
that
the
district
court
did
certify
this
case
under
1292(b),
but
firestone
elected
not
to
pursue
that
method
of
appeal,
so
that
they
appealed
under
1291.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i
cannot
say,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
passage
of
time
or...
i
just
don't
know.
but
they
elected...
now,
in
the
coopers
&
lybrand
case,
mr.
justice
stevens's
opinion
in
1978,
there
is
no
attempt
to
seek
the
1292
certification.
but
here
it
was
given
by
the
court
and
firestone
elected
not
to
do
so.
but
the
real
underlying
question
on
the
issue
of
appealability
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
is
simply
this,
the
cohen
doctrine
applies
to
a
small
class
of
cases.
it
is
an
exception
to
the
rules
of
final
decision
and
appealability,
and
the
question
before
this
court,
i
suggest,
is
should
this
limitation,
this
exception,
this
small
class
of
cases
be
expanded
to
include
a
type
of
case
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
found
is
disguised
harassment,
an
abused
procedure,
that
which
is
used
as
a
tactical
and
a
strategic
weapon.
now,
when
we
filed
our
brief
in
this
case,
i
think
on
page
21
we
cataloged
some
five
circuits
that
had
so
characterized
appeals
in
disqualification
cases.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
they
certainly
do,
but
the
courts
have
particularly
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
particular
subject
of
abuse,
and
the
five
circuits
have...
in
the
last
month
two
more
circuits
have
joined
the
procession.
the
3rd
circuit
in
the
p.
stone
case
which
we
have
in
our
supplemental
brief
joined
in
this
observation.
and
i
just
learned
yesterday
of
another
decision
from
the
1st
circuit.
and
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
provide
a
citation
of
this
case
to
the
court
by
letter.
but
the
1st
circuit
on
the
31st
of
october
of
this
year,
in
re:
continental
investment
corporation,
case
no.
80-1362,
also
made
a
similar
observation,
and
also
determined
that
cases
of
this
nature,
where
there
was
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
disqualify,
were
not
appealable.
there
has
been
a
consistent
movement
since
about
1976
away
from
the
rule
of
appealability.
when
this
case
came
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari,
firestone
referred
to
the
silver
chrysler
case
from
the
2nd
circuit
as
the
leading
case
for
the
rule
that
disqualification
denials
were
appealable.
in
may
of
this
year
that
decision
was
overruled
by
the
armstrong
case
in
the
2nd
circuit,
and
that
joined
the
procession
of
community
broadcasting
from
the
district
of
columbia,
melamed
from
the
6th
circuit,
this
case
below,
and
now,
october
31,
the
decision
of
the
1st
circuit
in
the
continental
investing
in
which
they
also
joined
in
the
ruling
that
these
cases
are
not
appealable.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
they
are
named
as
additional
defendants
in
a
number
of
the
cases
where
that's
applicable.
there
is
a
particular
case
against
goodyear
only
that's
part
of
this
record,
and
identical
claims
are
served
against
them.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
the
record
is
silent
on
that
subject.
i
would
certainly
think,
if
home
had
been
their
carrier,
we
would
have
known
about
it,
but
the
record
is
simply
silent
as
to
who
their...
we
know
that
home
is
firestone's
carrier,
but
the
record
is
silent
on
the
goodyear
carrier,
and
i
simply
have
to
assume
that
had
home
had
some
relation
to
any
of
the
other
defendants,
it
would
have
been
made
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i
do
not
know,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
this
is
the
only
motion
to
disqualify.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
firestone
who
is
arguing
here
that
what's
good
for
firestone
is
good
for
the
public,
is
the
only
person
making
the
complaint
in
this
disqualification
matter.
there
are
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
1978
decisions,
the
coopers
&
lybrand
case
that
i
referred
to;
and
u.s.
v.
macdonald,
mr.
justice
blackmun's
opinion,
in
which
the
cohen
doctrine
was
rejected.
coopers
&
lybrand
involved
denial
of
a
class
certification
motion,
macdonald
involved
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
a
speedy
trial
basis.
and
one
of
the
grounds
asserted
in
both
of
those
cases
was
that
those
particular
types
of
case
were
effectively
reviewable
on
appeal
after
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
and
i
would
suggest
in
this
case,
where
we
are
dealing
with
what
could
be
and
what
might
be
the
possibility
that
the
case
would
be
guided
or
fashioned
in
a
way
favorable
to
home
and
unfavorable
to
firestone,
that
it
can
only
be
effectively
reviewable
after
trial,
because
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
first,
the
court
might
rule
that
the
intentional
tort
theory
isn't
submissible
and
isn't
going
to
the
jury
at
all.
the
court
might
rule
that
all
theories
go,
in
which
case
we
don't
have
the
situation
that
firestone
complains
of
in
which
they're
simply
saying
that
it's
intentional
tort
only
and
there's
no
coverage,
and
therefore
the
the
load
is
all
on
firestone
and
goes
off
of
home.
we
simply
aren't
going
to
know.
so
the
case
is
really
only
effectively
reviewable
at
the
end
of
the
case.
and
these
courts
of
appeals
decisions
that
have
led
the
procession
away
from
appealability
have
based
their
reasoning
on
the
fact
that
these
cases
do
involve
factual
situations
and
they
are
effectively
reviewable
after
trial.
and
that's
community
broadcasting,
melamed,
armstrong,
and
the
new
continental
investment
case
that's
just
come
out.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
several
of
the
cases,
community
broadcasting,
melamed,
i
think
the
8th
circuit
in
this
case,
and
armstrong,
all
held
that
because
the
orders
granting
disqualification
parted
a
client
from
the
lawyer,
and
because
the
order
granting
really
certified
that
there
was
merit,
that
there
was
a
reason
for
treating
them
differently.
now,
armstrong
recognized
that
maybe
this
was
an
inconsistent
position,
and
the...
i
think
chief
judge
feinberg
in
his
majority
opinion
simply
accepted
the
fact
that
it
might
be
logically
inconsistent,
but
the
practicality
of
it
made
this
a
desirable
course.
i
think
the
1st
circuit
in
this
recent
opinion
simply
determined
that
it
would
not
reach
that
question.
but
i
think
there
is,
of
course--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--yes.
the
trend
is
to
treat
them
differently.
that's
correct,
your
honor;
that's
correct.
armstrong,
particularly,
pointed
out
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
trial
court
can
always
reconsider
the
motion,
that
protective
orders
can
be
issued,
and
that,
of
course,
reversal
and
a
new
trial
on
the
appellate
level
are
sufficient
remedies
to
take
care
of
the
particular
problem
involved
in
this
kind
of
case.
now,
the
recusal
cases
that
were
the
subject
a
minute
ago
are
one
specific
incident
where
courts
have
refused
appealability...
and
i
would
say
that
there
is
far
more
problem
from
the
public
perception
of
justice
so
far
as
recusal
motions
of
the
trial
judge
than
is
involved
in
the
attorney
situation.
certainly,
if
they're
even,
the
recusal
cases
are
strong
evidence
that
there
should
be
no
appeal
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
justice
stevens
in
coopers
&
lybrand
observed
that
rulings
on
venue,
summary
judgment,
and
discovery,
really
were
not
different
from
determinations
of
class
action
issues
that
were
involved
in
that
case
and
certainly
they
are
not
different
from
disqualification
motions.
there
are
other
issues.
now,
the
1st
circuit,
the
new
1st
circuit
decision,
armstrong,
both
pointed
to
the
important
legal
issue
as
an
aspect
of
the
cohen
doctrine.
armstrong
recognized
that
there
was
a
split
in
this
reasoning.
cohen
did
say
that
it
was
the
right
to
security
for
cost
that
was
the
issue
in
that
case
that
merited
appealability,
and
if
it
had
been
a
discretionary
ruling,
this
would
not
have
been
an
appealable
order.
again,
armstrong
goes
back
and
forth
on
whether
this
is
an
issue.
the
1st
circuit
new
decision
does
say
that
this
is
an
issue.
in
the
coopers
&
lybrand
decision,
mr.
justice
stevens
was
particularly
writing
about
the
death
knell
doctrine.
but
he
said
there
that
to
allow
appeals
from
cases
that
turned
on
the
facts
throws
the
appellate
court
into
the
trial
business,
and
obliterates
the
distinction
between
the
function
of
the
trial
court
and
the
function
of
the
appellate
court
as
has
been
set
out
in
the
statutory
scheme.
one
other
reason
for
the
importance
of
the
issue
being
a
factor
in
this
case
is
that
1292(b),
the
discretionary
appeal
statute,
did
not
exist
when
cohen
was
decided.
it
now
does
exist.
and
in
those
cases
where
there
is
the
possibility
of
irreparable
harm,
1292
is
available
and
1651
mandamus
is
also
available.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
well,
not...
i
think
under
1292(b)
a
legal
question
has
to
be
shown,
but
i
think
all
of
these
circuits
have
discussed
the
fact
that
these
discretionary
procedures
will
be
available
where
there
is
irreparable
damage
posed.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
do.
i
don't
think
they
do.
to
my
knowledge
they've
not.
two
other
issues
where
cohen
is
not
met
in
cases
of
this
kind:
separability
of
issues,
the
collateral
doctrine...
that's
the
very
wording,
that's
the
very
description
of
it...
simply
doesn't
apply
in
this
case,
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
has
been
filed
deals
with
this
question
because
the
entire
theory
of
firestone
is
that
the
trial
of
the
case
could
be
fashioned,
or
could
be
guided,
in
a
way
that
is
going
to
be
harmful
to
firestone
and
helpful
to
home.
and
we're
not
going
to
know,
really,
until
after
the
case
has
been
tried.
so
their
very
argument
in
this
case
is
tied
up
with
how
the
case
is
going
to
be
tried.
risjord--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--the
suggestion
on
behalf
of
firestone
that
it
consent?
your
honor,
i
think
the
record
on
that--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--this
is
the
point
that
we
raise
so
far
as
the
merits
of
this
case
are
concerned--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--that
firestone
was
never
a
client
of
risjord.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
and
that
the
disqualification
motion
should
only
have
been
available
to
a
client.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i
don't
think
there
was
discussion
of
it
at
the
time
the
trial
court
considered
this.
the
record
does
not
so
inform.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i
think
we'll
know--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--i
think
we
simply
can't
know.
the
trial
judge
found...
of
course--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--that's
been...
that's
in
the
record,
and
i
think
there's
no
discussion
of
that
at
all.
i
think
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
were
many
speculative
areas
raised
in
the
motions,
and
he
said,
i'm
going
to
disregard
all
of
those.
and
he
got
down
to
this
as
the
nub
of
it,
and
he
said,
any
possibility
of
adverse
effect
on
independent
representation
can
be
dispelled
by
filing
the
consents
or
by
withdrawal
from
the
one.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
the
trial
has
not
been
held
in
abeyance,
and
i
understand
discovery
has
proceeded
on.
in
this
particular
case
it
has
not
resulted
in
the
delay
that
many
of
the
courts
of
appeals
say
attend
the
filing
of
such
a
motion.
but--
mr.
john
r.
gibson
--in
this
case
discovery
activities
have
proceeded
on
and
i
think
they
are
still
a
ways
away
from
the
trial
of
the
first
case.
but,
of
course,
in
this
case
risjord
has
been
before
the
court
of
appeals,
firestone
has
been
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
discretionary
finding
of
the
trial
court
has
been
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
firestone
has
had
the
very
appeal
and
the
very
review
that
it
says
the
appealability
question
would
entitle
it
to.
and
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief
that
this
court
frequently
has
said,
where
two
courts,
where
a
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
passed
on
the
factual
considerations,
this
court
will
not
open
them
up
and
look
into
those
issues.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
i
think
as
a
matter
of
procedure
in
those
circuits,
these
orders
had
been
appealable
and
they
were
ruling
that
from
this
point
on
they
would
not
be
appealable,
so
that
the
lawyers
would
know
what
the
rule
is
going
to
be,
and
they
went
ahead
to
pass
on
the
merits,
because
the
change
was
made
in
these
cases.
now,
the
1st
circuit
didn't
do
that.
but
the
2nd
did,
the
6th
did,
the
8th
did.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's...
i
think
it
was
to
give
the
day
in
court,
to
go
the
extra
mile,
that
led
the
8th
circuit
as
well
as
the
2nd
and
the
6th
to
take
this
procedure,
because
then
the
new
procedure
was
spelled
out.
but
the
consents
were
obtained
and
were
filed.
the
withdrawal
took
place
and
really,
dr-5.105.
and
here
we
are
today
in
the
highest
court
of
the
land
that
is
a
court
of
law,
and
i
suggest
there
are
many
reasons
why
disciplinary
action
should
be
filed
with
the
state
court
disciplinary
mechanism.
we
have
one
in
missouri
that
is
appointed
by
the
missouri
supreme
court.
and
i
suggest
that's
an
appropriate
place
for
advancing
the
public
interest.
in
this
case
i
think
there
is
the
aspect
to
the
case
of
attempting
to
rid
oneself
of
a
very
vigorous
advocate,
a
lawyer
that
has
probed
deeply,
that
is...
i
think
publicity
in
a
companion
goodyear
case
was
one
of
the
grounds
in
this
motion
that
went
its
way.
they
have
probed
into
the
watergate
documents
deeply
to
find
a
connection
with
the
slush
fund
theory,
and
where
they're
going
with
that
i
don't
know,
but
we
have
a
vigorous
advocate,
and
as
these
courts
in
the
appealability
issues
rule,
the
tactical,
strategic
use
of
this,
the
disguised
harassment,
the
artifice
of
what
i
think
armstrong
refers
to
as
"the
artful
movement"
is
much
with
the
case.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
yes.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
well,
of
course,
i
think,
under
the
new
rules,
the
new
uniform
rules
of
attorney
conduct,
the
district
court
would
have
the
means
at
its
disposal
to
take
care
of
the
problem.
and
of
course
i
think
under
those
procedures
they
would
refer
to
the
state
bar
organization
where
that
exists.
mr.
john
r.
gibson
judge
collinson.
in
one
of
the
cases,
the
relief
that
is
requested
by
firestone
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court
simply
was
that
risjord
be
disqualified
in
any
case
in
which
home
had
coverage
or
in
which
confidential
information
had
passed
from...
in
any
way.
now,
the
admission
is
clear
that
there
was
no
passage
of
confidential
information,
because
risjord's
only
representation
of
home
was
in
the
totally
unrelated
fire
case.
and
the
other
basis
for
the
motion
was
not
satisfied
because
home
did
not
provide
coverage
in
the
hale
case.
and
this
simply
shows
the
overbroad
reach
of
the
motion
that
is
filed
in
this
case.
but
the
whole
issue
on
merits,
the
whole
issue
on
who
has
the
right
to
consent...
and
i
might
say
that
this
question
of
consent
is
discussed
in
the
4th
circuit
opinion
in
the
aetna
casualty
case
that's
referred
to
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
and
they
point
very
clearly
to
the
fact
that
it
is
the
client
that
is
required
to
give
the
consent.
and
in
that
case,
a
foreigner
to
this
attorney-client
relationship
is
attempting
to
assert
this
theory.
and
the
4th
circuit
held
that
it
is
the
right
of
a
client
that
exists
to
give
the
consent,
and
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case.
consents
were
obtained
from
home,
they
were
obtained
from
the
personal
injury
claimants.
and
i
might
say,
in
discussing
the
question
of
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
one
other
fact
that
has
not
come
before
this
court,
there
is
much
assertion
in
the
argument
of
firestone
that
risjord
obtained
consents
from
the
unsophisticated
plaintiffs.
and
this
court
was
not
told
in
the
briefs
that
three
of
those
unsophisticated
plaintiffs
had
referring
counsel
and
that
those
referring
counsel
had
discussed
the
consents
with
their
clients,
and
had
obtained
the
consents
from
the
clients
and
the
referring
counsel
had
also
given
their
consent.
but
it
is
omissions
of
fact
of
this
kind,
and
of
course
there
are
assertions
that
home
and
risjord
are
acting
in
tandem.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
at
all.
and
the
district
judge
said,
there
are
many
speculative
matters
that
he
is
not
going
to
get
to,
but
here
we
have
the
question
of
purely
a
factual
determination.
we
have
the
trial
court
exercising
discretion,
finding
the
facts,
reaching
conclusions
from
the
facts,
fashioning
a
remedy
of
either
withdrawal
from
the
representation
of
one
or
filing
the
consents.
risjord
did
both
of
those
things.
there
simply
is
no
issue
in
this
case
that
requires
disqualification,
and
the
entire
issue
really
can
turn
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
case
that
should
not
be
appealable,
and
that
ends
the
entire
discussion.
i
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
