justice
stevens
mr.
grossman,
the
question
really
isn't
whether
there's
a
necessity
for
delaying,
as
i
understand
it.
this
is
a
1291
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
if
it
is
a
final
order
within
the
meaning
of
1291,
i
suppose
there's
a
duty
to
appeal
within
30
days,
isn't
there,
if
it's
a
final
order?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
if
you
want
to
preserve
the
objection,
you've
got
to
appeal
within...
every
time
your
motion
is
denied.
justice
stevens
mr.
grossman,
is
there
law
on
the
question
whether
a
motion
to
disqualify
a
judge
that
is
denied
is
appealable
immediately?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it's
more
important
to
get
the
lawyer
out
than
the
judge
if
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
so
do...
a
motion
to
disqualify
a
judge
can
raise
the
same
kind
of
thing?
justice
stevens
well,
but
your
argument
is
that
this
lawyer
is
going
to
pursue
an
intentional
tort
theory
so
that
he
recovers
on
a
theory
where
there's
no
coverage.
that
affects
the
whole
prosecution
of
the
merits
of
the
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
sure
you
are.
whether
it's
an
intentional
or
a
negligent
theory
goes
to
the
claim
itself.
justice
stevens
was
there
a
motion
made
in
any
of
the
goodyear
cases
to
disqualify
mr.
risjord?
justice
stevens
so
then
goodyear
has
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
stevens
mr.
gibson,
do
you
happen
to
know,
has
the
trial
been
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
appeal?
justice
stevens
some
trial
courts
view
an
appeal
under
1291
as
requiring
that
the
trial
proceedings
stop,
whereas
an
appeal
under
1292(b)
permits
the
trial
proceedings
to
go
on.
but
they
went
on
here
in
either
event.
