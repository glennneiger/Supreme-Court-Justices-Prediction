justice
blackmun
mr.
grossman,
let
me
continue
the
interruption.
firestone
had
an
action
against
home
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
is
that
action
still
pending?
justice
blackmun
is
it
being
held
for
resolution
of
this
case,
or
just
clogged
in
the
calendar?
justice
blackmun
mr.
gibson,
home
is
not
only
listed
in
martindale,
it's
listed
first.
justice
blackmun
who
wouldn't
do
it?
martindale?
justice
blackmun
you
mean
martindale
would
not
adhere
to
his
request
for
a
change
in
his
listing
of
representative
clients?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know
why
they
made
that
choice?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know
why
they
made
that
choice?
justice
blackmun
well,
judge
lay
certainly
spelled
it
out
specifically,
that
it
was
prospective
and
not
applicable
to
this
case.
justice
blackmun
that
he
had
to,
in
order
to
rule.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
mr.
risjord
was
a
member
of
the
missouri
bar.
justice
blackmun
if
he
were
not,
suppose
he
were
a
visiting
lawyer,
what
you
have
just
said
would
be
rather
inapplicable,
wouldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
who
is
the
district
judge
here?
judge
collinson?
