mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
basic
questions.
was
the
order
denying
firestone's
motion
to
disqualify
john
risjord
appealable,
and
if
so,
should
that
order
be
reversed?
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
before
addressing
the
questions,
i
would
briefly
summarize
the
nature
of
the
factual
backgrounds
that
give
rise
to
them.
in
essence,
attorney
john
risjord
represents
the
plaintiff
in
certain
personal
injury
suits
against
firestone.
mr.
risjord's
firm
also
has
a
long-standing
relationship
with
the
insurance
company,
home
insurance
company,
which
insures
firestone
against
those
very
claims.
the
record
reflects
that
for
some
20
years
mr.
risjord's
firm
has
represented
home,
the
insurer
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
throughout
that
time
has
held
home
out
to
the
public
as
its
foremost
insurance
client
by
listing
it
first
in
a
non-alphabetical
listing
of
insurance
clients
in
the
martindale-hubbell
directory.
in
prosecuting
his
personal
injury
suits
against
firestone,
mr.
risjord
has
included
a
theory
of
intentional
tort,
and
based
on
that
theory
home
has
disclaimed
coverage
under
its
policy.
firestone
moved
for
mr.
risjord's
disqualification,
contending
that
in
his
management
of
the
personal
injury
cases
he
inevitably
would
be
affected,
consciously
or
unconsciously,
by
his
awareness
of
home's
interest
in
defeating
coverage,
and
that
even
if
it
were
assumed
that
his
original
selection
of
that
theory
of
intentional
tort
weren't
prompted
by
home's
interest
in
determining
whether
or
how
aggressively
to
pursue
it,
he
would
necessarily
be
affected,
clouded
as
it
were,
in
his
judgment,
because
he
would
know
that
pursuit
of
that
theory
would
be
helpful
and
its
abandonment
harmful
to
his
firm's
longstanding
client,
home.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
as
i
understand
the
question,
it
is
directed
to
the
matter
of--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--i
would
say,
no,
your
honor.
i
would
not
view
that
as
requisite--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--i
don't
know.
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company
is
not
a
client
of
our
office,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
this--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--no,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
who
covers
them.
i
have
no
knowledge
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
i'm
aware
of
that
indicates
that
home
was
their
insurer
but
i
couldn't
state
that
for
a
fact.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
i
see
no
problem
whatever
in
that
regard.
the
trial
court
recognized
on
the
undisputed
facts
mr.
risjord
did
in
fact
face
a
conflict
of
interest,
but
the
court
then
went
on
to
say,
in
substance,
that
he
nevertheless
could
continue
to
represent
the
personal
injury
plaintiffs
against
firestone
if
he
obtained
the
consent
of
those
plaintiffs
and
of
home
insurance
company.
firestone
appealed
from
that
determination,
contending
that
not
only
was
this
not
a
situation
where
a
consent
approach
was
really
a
viable
solution,
but
the
trial
court's
approach
to
the
consent
was
flawed
in
any
event.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
because,
your
honor,
firestone
viewed
the
matter,
or
had
to
view
the
matter
not
only
in
terms
of
whether
the
case
might
be
won
or
lost,
but
also
from
the
standpoint
of
insurability.
and
irrespective
of
the
impact
of
mr.
risjord's
conflict
of
interest
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
it
would
at
the
very
least
create
a
greater
risk
that
any
recovery,
even
if
more
remote
overall,
would
more
likely
be
fashioned
in
a
manner
to
defeat
coverage.
and
we
submit
that
that
would
be
a
gamble
that
firestone
ought
not
to
be
required
to
take
and
that
even
if
firestone
were
willing
to
take
it
the
public
interest
shouldn't
permit
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
assume
that...
well,
there
are
at
least
three
ways
that
firestone
would
suffer,
we
would
contend.
first
of
all,
of
course,
if
in
fact
his
conflict
led
him
to
pursue
the
case
in
a
way
that
was
guided
in
terms
of
insurability.
we
think
that
factor
would
prejudice
firestone
because
they
are
entitled
to
have
the
case
presented
by
an
attorney
who
is
guided
by
the
interest
of
the
plaintiff,
not
of
the
insurance
carrier.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
as
i
said,
they
could
affect
the
prospect
that
any
recovery
might
be
fashioned
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
coverage
under
the
policy.
and
there's
an
additional
burden,
i
would
cite
to
the
court,
and
that
is
that
even
if
firestone
ultimately
prevails
on
the
merits,
firestone
could
be
prejudiced
by
being
required
to
defend
against
claims
which
but
for
mr.
risjord's
conflict
of
interests
would
not
have
been
pursued
or
if
pursued
would
have
been
abandoned
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
action
is
still
pending,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
no.
it
is
simply
pending
in
the
lower
court
and
it
has
not
been
set
for
trial
at
this
time.
i
might
add...
well,
excuse
me.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
our
position
is
that
firestone
is
put
at
risk
because
it
stands
a
greater
chance
that
recovery
or
the
prospects
of
recovery
might
more
likely
be
guided,
or
i
should
say
the
recovery
might
more
likely
be
fashioned
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
coverage
under
home's
policy.
and
we
think
that's
a
risk
which
shouldn't
enter
into
the
case.
firestone
shouldn't
face
the
risk
that
the
case
will
be
guided,
not
just
in
terms
of
the
victory
of
the
plaintiff...
that's
a
risk
that
they
obviously
would
have
to
take,
but
they
shouldn't
have
to
take
the
risk
that
the
case
would
be
guided
in
such
a
way
that
if
plaintiff
recovers
the
recovery
would
be
more
likely
fashioned
in
a
way
that
would
prejudice
the
position
of
firestone
as
against
home
on
its
insurance
policy.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
if
he
imparted
his
matters
of
public
to
another
lawyer,
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
ordinarily,
i
would
say,
not
unless
there
was
some
link
between
the
two.
not
if
the
other
attorney
were
entirely
independent
and
took
over
the
case,
it
would
seem
ordinarily
we
would
not
be
complaining
about
that.
assume
the
other
lawyer
has
no
connection
with
home
insurance
company,
there'd
be
no
problem
that
i
could
see,
ordinarily,
in
that
instance.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
if
home
assigned--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--the
reason
we
are
concerned,
your
honor,
is
that
we--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--well,
not
just
the
question
of
paying
more
money.
we
run
the
risk
that
we--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--our
position,
obviously,
is
prompted
by
what
we
perceive
to
be
firestone's
interests,
but
we
believe
in
this
particular
case
firestone's
interest
happens
to
coalesce
with
the
public
interest
because
the
continued
prosecution
of
this
case
in
the
face
of
the
conflict
of
interest
that
firestone's
complaining
of
in
our
view
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
it
injects
an
element
of
the
case,
that
is,
the
consideration
of
home,
a
division
of
loyalty,
a
lack
of
independent
judgment,
which
ought
not
to
be
permitted.
and
to
further
answer
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
that
we
don't
feel
the
question
is
hypothetical,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
inevitable
in
our
view
that
mr.
risjord
being
human,
knowing
of
home's
interest,
that
his
judgment
will
be
clouded
by
that
awareness.
the
only
problem
we
face
is
that
we
cannot
determine,
and
really
can't
measure
at
any
stage
in
the
proceeding,
just
what
the
impact
is.
we
won't
be
able
to
tell
that
even
when
the
case
is
finally
decided.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is.
firestone...
so
i
can
clarify
that
matter...
firestone
selects
its
own
counsel.
the
problem
here
is
not
that
home
has
picked
an
attorney
to
represent
firestone,
but
rather
it's
the
link
between
home
and
the
plaintiff
attorney.
and
our
concern,
and
i
think
the
reason
that
the
court
ought
to
be
concerned
with
that
situation,
even
though
it
differs
from
the
usual
case
where
the
insurance
company
selects
an
attorney
to
represent
the
defendant
and
the
conflict
arises
in
that
context,
is
that
where
the
insurance
company
is
linked
to
the
plaintiff's
attorney,
number
one,
he
has
greater
control
over
the
case
than
does
the
defendant's
attorney;
number
two,
there
are
two
interests
at
jeopardy,
the
plaintiffs
he
represents...
and
we
submit
that
the
risk
toward
plaintiffs,
for
example,
ought
to
be
represented
by
counsel
whose
judgments
are
not
prompted
by
divided
loyalty.
that
may
not
be
firestone's
motives,
but
we
believe
that
their
interests
coincide
with
those
of
firestone
in
this
instance.
and
thirdly,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
where
the
insurance
carrier
is
linked
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
case...
as
in
this
instance,
the
plaintiff's
attorney...
it's
much
more
difficult
to
police
the
effect
or
impact
of
a
conflict
of
interest
on
the
myriad
of
tactical
and
strategic
choices
that
an
attorney
like
mr.
risjord
is
going
to
make,
or
will
have
to
make,
in
the
course
of
the
case.
and,
of
course,
there's
the
danger
that...
let's
assume
that
firestone
ultimately
attains
reversal,
there's
still
the
danger
that
since
a
retrial
doesn't
start
with
a
really
clean
slate,
that
in
the
interim
the
proceedings
would
have
been
indelibly
painted
with
acts
or
omissions
of
mr.
risjord
prompted
by
his
concern
for
home.
and
at
this
point
i'd
like
to
address
a
question
i
think
implicit
in
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
earlier,
and
that
is
the
possibility
of
a
suit
by
firestone
against
home.
the
reason
we
don't
feel
that's
an
answer
is,
first
of
all,
that
the
conflicts
question
we're
concerned
with
in
this
instance
is
really
separate
from
whether
or
not
home
is
accountable
to
firestone.
and
secondly,
we
believe
the
most
appropriate
place
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
a
consent
approach
which
the
trial
court
adopted
here
is
the
very
proceeding
where
those
consents
are
relied
on...
and
firestone
ought
not
to
be
relegated
to
the
vagaries
of
whatever
relief
if
any
it
might
be
able
to
obtain
against
home,
given
the
problems
of
proving
damages,
the
impact
of
the
action
of
home
on
the
outcome,
and
so
on.
now--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--we
don't
believe
any
discretion
was
involved,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
the
trial
court
acknowledged
that
the
conflict
existed.
the
facts
were
essentially
undisputed.
the
trial
court
erred,
or
went
off
base,
so
to
speak,
because
it
didn't
render
appropriate
redress
for
the
conflict,
and
we
think
in
that
context--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--we
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
appropriate
place
for
the
trial
court
to
exercise
discretion
in
that
situation.
we
don't
believe
that
it
was
called
upon
to
exercise
discretion
in
that
context,
just
as
we
don't
believe
that
this
was
a
case
where
the
trial
court
has
decided
any
disputed
fact
issue
which
might
be
entitled
to
deference.
it's
simply
a
case
where
the
trial
court
misperceived
the
consequences
of
its
own
findings
of
fact.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
next
considered
the
matter.
and
as
i
mentioned,
firestone's
position
was
that
the
trial
court's
consent
approach
was
flawed
because
they
looked
to
the
wrong
party's
consent,
and
consent
wasn't
viable.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit,
without
hearing
argument,
only
addressed
the
merits
in
one
sentence
in
which
they
stated,
in
substance,
the
trial
court's
action
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
as
i
just
mentioned,
i
don't
think
that
really
even
addressed
the
problem.
basically,
what
that
court
addressed
was
the
question
of
appealability
and
held
in
effect
that
in
that
circuit
appeals
from
orders
denying
disqualification
would
no
longer
lie.
i
should
mention
one
other
fact.
at
the
time
of
the
motion
the
record
reflects
that
mr.
risjord
was
representing
home
in
one
case,
the
cannova
case.
subsequently,
he
withdrew
from
that
case
and
ultimately
the
case
has
been
disposed
of.
well,
we
submit
that
it
doesn't
really
obviate
the
conflict,
because
irrespective
of
whether
mr.
risjord
or
his
firm
are
representing
home
at
a
given
instant,
mr.
risjord
would
be
aware
that
his
firm's
potential
future
business
with
a
longstanding
client,
home,
could
be
affected
by
whether
his
actions
in
the
personal
injury
suits
against
firestone
tend
to
further
or
defeat
home's
efforts
to
avoid
coverage.
now,
turning
first
to
a
question
raised
at
the
outset,
the
threshold
question
of
appealability,
we
contend
that
not
only
are
the
cohen
criteria
satisfied
but
that
the
treatment
of
appeals
of
orders
denying
disqualification
as
appealable
would
be
consistent
with
sound
judicial
administration.
inasmuch
as
it's
generally
conceded
that
the
cohen
criteria
of
finality
and
separability
are
present,
the
key
question
is
whether
the
cohen
test
of
urgency
is
met.
in
other
words,
do
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
appeal
can
wait
until
the
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
case
or
not?
we
submit
we
can't
wait,
because
in
the
interim
the
parties
and
the
public
interest
will
have
suffered
irreparable
injury.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
it
is
correct
that
i
believe
a
stronger
case
can
be
made
for
appealability
of
orders
denying
disqualification
than
of
orders
granting,
but
i
think
i
would
frankly
acknowledge
that
even
as
to
orders
granting
disqualification,
the
general
view
that
their
appealability
is
not
one
that
i
would
be
prone
to
take
issue
with,
although
i
think
we
have
a
stronger
case
under
cohen
in
the
case
of
orders
denying
disqualification.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
i
believe
that
would
be
a
valid
concern.
i
believe
that
would
be
a
valid
concern
which
isn't
present
here
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
concern
points
up
the
fact
that
in
our
view
the
courts
which
have
held
that
appeal
is
to
be
permitted
where
disqualification
is
granted,
not
where
it
is
denied,
really
are
proceeding
in
a
sense
topsy-turvy,
because
the
stronger
case
can
be
made
when
the
denial
occurs,
rather
than
where
the
grant
occurs.
now,
again
addressing
the
urgency
factor,
the
reason
we
believe
this
injury
occurs
is
essentially
this,
and
why
we
believe
appealability
should
be
permitted.
if
we
wait
until
the
final
judgment
on
the
merits,
there
is
the
danger...
and
obviously
no
one
can
say;
it
is
a
matter
of
prediction,
because
no
one
can
say
with
certainty
just
what's
going
to
happen
in
case...
but
there
is
a
real
danger
that
the
case
will
become
indelibly
stamped
or
shaped
by
the
fruits
of
a
breach
of
confidence
or
by
acts
or
omissions
prompted
by
divided
loyalty,
as
in
the
present
case.
and
there's
no
way
that
an
appeal
for
the
final
judgment
on
the
merits
could
really
remedy
that.
and
in
terms
of
the
public
interest...
and
we
think
that
it
is
appropriate
to
address
that
question,
irrespective
of
firestone's
personal
concerns
here...
the
very
fact
that
a
case
proceeds
in
the
face,
with
the
taint
of
a
conflict,
in
our
view
would
tend
to
undermine
the
public
policy
which
proscribes
conflicts
of
interest
and
would
adversely
color
the
public's
perception
of
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.

while
there
is
authority
and
there
are
cases
suggesting
that
any
attorney,
at
least...
leaving
aside
the
question
of
a
lay
person...
any
attorney
who
in
a
case,
who
was
aware
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
because
of
the
public
policy
considerations
involved,
does
have
a
duty
to
call
that
to
the
court's
attention.
i
believe
that
view
is
sound
if
that
is
the
question.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
i
would
submit,
mr.
justice,
that
if
in
fact
that
did
occur
it
would
be
appropriate.
however,
i
would
state
that
in
this
instance,
fortunately,
we
needn't
address
that
situation
because
we
feel
that
firestone
does
have
a
very
strong
personal
interest
which
entitles
it
to
raise
it,
the
question,
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated.
in
other
words,
we
feel
there
is
a
degree
of
private
prejudice,
so
the
court
in
this
case
doesn't
have
to
address
the
question
whether
a
public
interest
concern
alone
would
be
sufficient.
i
believe
it
ought
to
be;
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
rest
the
decision
here
on
that
ground.
now,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
we
don't
have
to
allow
appeal
under
the
cohen
doctrine
here
because
the
parties
can
secure
relief
under
alternative
means.
one
suggested
is
writ
proceedings;
another,
permissive
appeals
under
1292(b)
of
the
judicial
code.
we
submit,
however,
that
if
writs
are
kept
within
the
limits
that
this
court
has
prescribed,
and
they're
very
narrow
limits,
they
don't
afford
a
proper
means
of
redress
in
this
instance.
and
on
the
other
hand,
we
believe
it
would
be
unwise
for
the
court
to
disregard
the
limits
on
writs
and
allow
them
to
be
used
in
effect
as
substitute
appeals
because
that
would
set
the
lower
courts
adrift
without
the
benefit
of
the
cohen
guidelines.
and
as
for
permissive
appeals,
the
very
criteria
the
statute
lays
down
for
such
appeals
would
tend
to
preclude
their
use
in
many
instances
involving
orders
denying
disqualification.
for
example,
the
very
fact
that
those
orders
are
collateral
might
be
viewed
as
an
indication
that
the
disposition
of
the
order...
or
appeal
from
the
order,
i
should
say,
would
not
necessarily
further
the
ultimate
disposition
of
litigation,
as
required
under
1292(b).
and
finally,
on
this
question
of
appealability,
i
would
submit
that
this
isn't
a
situation
where
deferring
appeal
until
final
judgment
is
really
helpful
because,
no
matter
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
we
look
at
the
matter,
there's
just
no
way
to
tell
what
the
impact
of
the
conflict
would
have
been.
so
we
don't
gain
any
benefit
by
waiting.
now,
if
this
is
the
case,
the
question
is,
why,
if
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
nip
a
proceeding
in
the
bud
where
it's
tainted,
have
some
of
the
courts
failed
to
allow
appeals?
i
think
the
answer
rests
on
two
misconceptions.
the
first,
that
this
sort
of
appeal
would
deluge
the
appellate
courts.
the
experience
of
the
2nd
circuit,
which
we
cited,
supposedly
the
worst
case,
does
not
bear
out...
11
published
opinions
in
six
years
certainly
doesn't
account
for
the
deluge.
and
it's
worth
noting
that
in
a
significant
percentage
of
those
cases
the
court
below
was
reversed.
and
neither
do
we
believe
that
there's
any
necessity
for
delaying
the
proceedings
based
on
the
appeal
of
a
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
haven't
delayed
the
proceedings
here--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
would
be
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
submit
that
for
that
same
reason
there's
no
need
to
look
to
alternative
remedies
because
if
the
appeal
lies
under
1291,
then
this
court's
cohen
doctrine
would
indicate
that's
as
far
as
we
have
to
go.
we
don't
have
to
look
any
further
for
alternative
remedy.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
is
correct.
and
abney,
i
believe,
this
court's
decision
in
abney
teaches
that
if
there
is
any
abuse
the
court
can
control
it
by
appropriate
rules
and
policies,
expedite
appeals,
and
to--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--there
is
relatively
little
on
that,
and
the
little
that
exists
would
indicate
that
it's
not
appealable.
i
think
the
problem
in
that
instance
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
situation
we're
dealing
with
here,
is
that
where
a
judge
is
involved,
the
only
real
impact
is
on
the
disposition
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
argument
is
that
the
case
will
be
wrongly
decided
and
that
of
course
doesn't
give
rise
to
the
question
of
separability
or
the
collateral
nature
of
the
matter--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--well,
the
problem
with
the
attorney's
disqualification
is
it
raises
a
question
of
breach
of
confidence
and
of
breach
of--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--no,
but
where
the
motion
is
to
disqualify
a
judge,
the
ruling,
or
the
matter
really
goes
to
the
ultimate
disposition
of
the
case.
the
effect
of
it
isn't
that
there
be
an
intervening...
no,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
in
the
case
of
a
judge
disqualification,
normally
the
challenge
is
not
that
during
the
interim
he's
going
to
be
breaching
loyalty
or
breaching
confidence,
using
clients'
secrets.
rather,
that
he
is
prejudiced
in
a
way
that
will
impair
a
decision
on
the
merits,
and
because
of
that
we
submit
that
that
type
of
a
case
doesn't
lend
itself
to
disposition
under
cohen
because
it's
tied
to
the
merits.
it
doesn't
present
the
separability
factor.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
well,
not
in
the
sense
that
cohen
uses
the
term,
because
we're
not
addressing
a
question
which
goes
to
the
claim
itself.
it
is
true,
i
would
concede--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--but
the
mere
fact
that
a
ruling
may
affect
the
manner
in
which
the
case
is
handled
in
our
view
doesn't
dissipate
the
separability
because,
for
example,
in
stack
v.
boyle,
when
we
speak
of
excessive
bail,
which
this
court
held
was
appealable
under
cohen.
it's
true
that
if
the
court
posts,
or
requires
excessive
bail,
the
client
may
not
be
able
to
consult
with
his
attorney,
and
that
may
impair
the
attorney's
prosecution
of
the
case.
but
we
would
submit
that
is
much
too
tangential
to
defeat
separability
under
the
cohen
doctrine
in
this
instance.
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
that
is
correct,
because--
mr.
harvey
m.
grossman
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
also
addresses
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
would
be
an
argument
for
treating,
if
the
court
were
to
so
conclude,
for
treating
denials
of
disqualification
as
appealable
even
if
grants
were
not
so
treated.
