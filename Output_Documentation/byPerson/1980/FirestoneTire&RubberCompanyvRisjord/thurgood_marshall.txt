justice
marshall
mr.
grossman,
suppose
this
lawyer
had
withdrawn
his
name
and
had
in
turn
given
all
of
his
plans,
all
of
his
trial
briefs,
to
another
lawyer.
would
you
have
a
complaint
against
that
lawyer?
justice
marshall
if
he
handed
anything
he
wanted
to
him,
could
you
complain
about
it?
justice
marshall
well,
suppose
he's
a
new
lawyer
that
home
had
just
hired?
i'm
asking
to
see
how
hypothetical
your
position
is.
justice
marshall
you're
still
worried
about
what
might
happen,
which
has
not
happened,
and
might
not
happen.
is
that
what
you're
complaining
about?
justice
marshall
you
might
have
to
pay
more
money.
justice
marshall
well,
are
you
pursuing
the
public
interest
or
your
own
private
firestone
interests?
because
if
you
aren't,
how
are
you
going
to
recognize
that
as
money?
justice
marshall
--is
your
claim
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
marshall
mr.
grossman,
isn't
it
true
that
where
an
intervenor
files
to
intervene
and
it's
denied,
he
can
appeal,
but
if
it's
granted,
the
other
side
cannot
appeal?
isn't
that
true?
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
that
a
lot
like
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
an
order
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
refusing
to
disqualify
the
respondent
who
has
an
attorney
from
representing
the
plaintiffs
in
an
ongoing
civil
suit
against
petitioners.
the
eighth
circuit
also
held
that
in
the
future,
such
orders
would
not
be
appealable
until
after
final
judgment
in
the
underlying
litigation.
they've
made
a
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
of
where
the
orders
denying
motion
to
disqualify
counsel
in
civil
cases
are
appealable
and
final
decisions
under
28
united
states
code
section
1291.
we
held
--
we
hold
here
that
these
orders
are
not
appealable
prior
to
final
judgments
on
the
merits
of
the
underlying
litigation.
if
a
denial
of
disqualification
motion
is
erroneous,
it
is
fully
reviewable
on
appeal
after
the
trial
is
terminated.
we
also
hold
that
although
the
eighth
circuit
properly
reached
this
conclusion,
it
committed
error
by
making
its
decision
perspective
only
and
reaching
the
merits
of
the
disqualification
motion.
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.
1291
are
jurisdictional
and
once
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
the
order
was
not
appealable,
it
should
have
dismissed
the
appeal.
reasons
for
these
conclusions
are
more
fully
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
vacated.
the
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
rehnquist
joined
by
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
