chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
rhodes
v.
chapman.
mr.
adler,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
they
are
opinions
of
the
writers,
opinions
of
the
authors.
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
everything
that's
undesirable
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
burger
well,
100
years
ago
they
weren't
classifying
prisons
in
that
way,
were
they?
chief
justice
burger
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
use
the
term.
it
said
that
the
remedy
provided
by
the
district
court
was
a
reasonable
response.
now,
apparently,
they
skirted
the
constitutional
issue
in
terms,
while
apparently
affirming
a
holding
of
unconstitutionality
by
the
district
court.
chief
justice
burger
is
that
the
way
you
read
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
this
is
the
only
circumstance
the
court
had
any
business
dealing
with.
chief
justice
burger
the
only
circumstance
that
the
trial
judge
or
the
court
of
appeals
were
dealing
with
was
this
case.
chief
justice
burger
not
some
hypothetical
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
kamp.
chief
justice
burger
now,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
acted
on
the
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
they
did
not
read
the
district
court
as
deciding
the
case
on
the
constitutional
basis?
chief
justice
burger
in
the
language
of
its
opinion
in
its
penultimate
paragraph,
is
the
usual
finding
that
we
associate
with
court
of
appeals'
opinions,
finding
no
clear
error.
now,
that
isn't
the
traditional
way
of
dealing
with
making
a
constitutional
finding,
is
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
it
constitutional
or
not?
not
totality.
that's
a
subsidiary
question.
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
your
view
decide
this
case
on
the
constitutional
basis?
chief
justice
burger
they
said
double-celling...
the
prohibition
of
double-celling
was
a
reasonable
response.
is
that
a
constitutional
holding?
chief
justice
burger
well,
mrs.
kamp,
if
the
trier,
the
original
trier
is
looking
at
the
totality
or
one
specific
conduct
like,
let
us
say,
the
hanging
by
the
thumbs.
the
district
judge
must
say,
yea,
or
nay,
on
whether
there's
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
whether
it's
totality
or
a
specific
act.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
did
it
on
totality
or
on
a
specific
finding
of
one
cruel
punishment?
chief
justice
burger
i
hate
to
repeat
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that's
what
he
didn't
find.
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
violation
here
of
the
eight
amendment
under
all
circumstances.
now,
all
circumstances
brings
us
back
to
the
totality.
chief
justice
burger
well,
it's
very
important
to
us,
what
each
of
these
courts
held
so
we
know
what
it
is
we're
reviewing.
can
i
direct
your
attention
to
a.
36,
last
paragraph,
where
he
discusses
the
cells?
chief
justice
burger
was
any
evidence
tendered
to
the
court
as
to
the
comparative
amount
of
space
for
each
seaman
on
a
submarine?
chief
justice
burger
of
those
five
percent,
of
course,
the
impact
is
the
same
as
if
it
were
the
95
percent,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
they're
not
normally
in
their...
confined
in
their
cells
most
of
the
time,
as
you
suggest?
chief
justice
burger
they
sleep
in
the
cells.
the
only
time
they're
confined
is
for
some
disciplinary
measure.
chief
justice
burger
do
the
specialists
of
our
society
make
contemporary
conditions
of
decency?
can
those...
be
standards?
chief
justice
burger
they
may
propose
them,
but
do
they
make
them?
chief
justice
burger
well,
are
you
raising
a
health
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
adler?
chief
justice
burger
the
court
of
appeals
order...
or
per
curiam,
however
it's
characterized...
doubles
back
on
itself
about
fifteen
lines
later,
and
that
is
at
least
a
partial
contradiction
of
its
earlier
hints
about
the
eight
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
