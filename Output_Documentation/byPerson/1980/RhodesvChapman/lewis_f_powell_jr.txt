justice
jr.
mrs.
kamp,
how
do
you
interpret
the
finding
on
page
a-18
of
the
petition
with
respect
to
time
spent
out
of
cell?
it
says
about
75
percent
of
the
inmates
who
are
in
double
cells
have
a
choice
of
spending
a
considerable
amount
of
their
time
outside
of
their
cells.
and
on
the
preceding
page,
near
the
bottom,
it
says,
"the
occupants
of
960
of
those
cells.
"
--and
they
identify
the
cells...
"are
out
of
their
cells
some
ten
hours
a
day.
"
do
you
question
those
findings?
justice
jr.
but
you
read
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
had
the
privilege
of
being
out
at
least
ten
hours
a
day?
justice
jr.
on
the
average.
justice
jr.
well,
you
had
prisoners
in
different
classifications,
of
course?
