justice
stevens
general
adler,
can
i
ask
you
just
a
question
about
the
facts
for
a
moment,
and
the
relief?
the
case
was
decided,
i
think,
in
1978,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
and
i
think
the
judge
ordered
you
to
reduce
the
population
by
25
inmates
a
month,
as
i
remember
the
relief.
and
if
my
arithmetic
is
correct,
i
assume
that
the
order
probably
brought
you
down
so
you
don't
have
any
double-celling
anymore?
justice
stevens
so
we're
kind
of
arguing...
i
understand
the
state
still
has
an
interest
and
it's
not
moot
but
it's
kind
of
a
theoretical
problem
now,
i
gather.
justice
stevens
but
not
actually...
but
not
in
this
particular
institution?
you're
really
fighting
for
the
right
to
transfer
people
back
in,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
general
adler,
perhaps
this
is
the
same
point
that
justice
stewart
is
making,
but
on
the
one
hand,
i
suppose,
bell
v.
wolfish
establishes
that
double-celling
is
not
always
unconstitutional.
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
in
some
circumstances
it
might
be,
if
you
had,
say,
14-foot
cells
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
and
the
question
that
i'd
like
to
ask
is,
where
is
the
line
between
the
two
extremes?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
not
quite
right
because,
as
i
understand
the
district
court's
opinion,
not
necessarily
as
the
result
of
the
double-celling
as
a
result
of
the
increased
population
in
the
prison,
there
was
more
violence
and
more
serious
incidents
as
well
as--
justice
stevens
--that's
the
way
i
read
it;
yes.
justice
stevens
not
per
prisoner,
but
there
was
more
violence
in
the
institution.
justice
stevens
but
just...
you
would
say
it
was
in
arithmetic
proportion
rather
than
geometric
proportion?
justice
stevens
i
see.
mr.
adler,
another
difference
too
is
in
wolfish
most
of
them
were
temporary.
isn't
that
a
major
difference?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
adler,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about,
supposing
you
win
this
case
and
we
say,
on
the
record
before
us
none
of
these
things
have
been
shown.
and
then
you
continue
the
double-celling
for
ten
years,
and
it
gets
even
a
little
bit
more
crowded.
would
res
judicata
protect
you
from
relitigation
of
the
problem
that
the
longer
period
of
incarceration
and
perhaps
evidence
of
further
harm
resulting
from
several
years
of
this
practice?
justice
stevens
now
say
they
do
it
in
six
months.
they
say,
well,
we
really...
and
they
now
allege,
we
now
have
a
let
more
evidence
of
harm
than
we
had
in
the
first
trial.
i
suppose
if
you
just
have
to
allege
additional
harm,
you
never
get
the
benefit
of
res
judicata.
justice
stevens
and
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
the
longer
these
conditions
persist,
the
greater
risk
you
have
that
that
might
actually
happen?
justice
stevens
it's
two
years,
i
know,
but
they're
talking
about...
these
are
people
who
may
be
in
for
a
good
deal
longer.
justice
stevens
in
other
words--
justice
stevens
--there's
an
irony
in
litigation
of
this
kind.
it
might
actually
be
to
the
benefit
of
your
employers
to
lose
the
litigation
so
the
legislature
would
help
you
out
with
some
of
your
problems.
