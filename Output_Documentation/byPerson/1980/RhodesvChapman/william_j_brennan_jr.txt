justice
jr.
mr.
adler,
now
that
we
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask
something?
i
notice
at
a-36
in
judge
hogan's
findings
of
fact,
he
recites
a
number
of
empirical
social
science
studies,
as
i
understand
them:
the
american
correctional
institute,
national
sheriffs
association
handbook,
manual
on
jail
administration,
national
council
on
crime
and
delinquency,
et
cetera,
and
so
forth;
all
of
which
come
up
with
some
conclusions
as
to
the
minimum
requirement
per
inmate
in
the
way
of
cell
space.
have
you
any
suggestion?
incidentally,
how
did
that
all
get
in,
do
you
remember?
how
did
that
get
into
the
record?
is
this
something
of
which
judge
hogan
took
judicial
notice?
or?
justice
jr.
well,
have
you
any
suggestion...
i
don't
see
any
in
the
brief...
how
we
ought
to
treat
social
science
studies
of
that
kind
in
deciding
eighth
amendment
questions?
justice
jr.
well
have
you
or
the
state
any
suggestion
as
to
what
would
be
an
adequate
amount
of
floor
space
per
prisoner?
fifteen
square
feet?
ten
square
feet,
or
what?
justice
jr.
what
do
you
suggest?
justice
jr.
the
state
made
no
submission
as
to
what
it
thought
might
be
minimum,
did
it?
justice
jr.
well,
just,
you
mean,
as
a
matter
of
it
being
more
comfortable
than
at
68
or
70?
justice
jr.
did
the
authorities
in
ohio
recognize
that
there
is
any
minimum
at
all?
justice
jr.
those
things
that
they
desire,
they'd
like
to
have
single-celling,
they'd
like
to
have
68-70,
but
it
hasn't
worked
out
that
way.
actually,
what
has
happened
is,
you
have
these
conditions
in
the
prison
of...
what
is
done?
34
feet,
something
like
that?
justice
jr.
and
even
your
own
authorities
think
that's
not
a
desirable?
justice
jr.
don't
most
of
those
cases
draw
on
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment?
all
of
them
do,
don't
they?
justice
jr.
well,
in
answer
to
my
brother
rehnquist,
i
guess
the
answer
is,
the
unconstitutionality
has
been
found
in
a
holding
of
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
justice
jr.
well,
mrs.
kamp,
i
guess
you
can
answer
the
question
i
asked
your
colleague.
these
are
all
based
on
the
empirical
social
studies,
aren't
they?
justice
jr.
and
what's
your
suggestion
as
to
the
propriety
of
relying
on
studies
of
that
kind
in
determining
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
matter?
justice
jr.
well,
is
there
anything
to
suggest
what
actually
is
the
adequate
amount,
in
this
institution,
of
floor
space
per
prisoner,
to
avoid
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
50
square
feet--
justice
jr.
--did
you
argue
at
the
trial?
justice
jr.
and
these
studies
were
all
submitted,
were
they,
as
part
of
the
case?
justice
jr.
part
of
the
briefs?
justice
jr.
i
take
it
you'd
suggest
that
some
of
these
social
studies
at
least
bear
on
contemporary
standards
of
decency?
justice
jr.
well,
they're
not
public
bodies.
