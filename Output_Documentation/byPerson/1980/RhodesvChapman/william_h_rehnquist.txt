justice
rehnquist
i
thought
that
the
district
court
at
one
point
in
its
opinion
says
it
was
not
holding
that
double-celling
per
se
was
unconstitutional?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
in
effect
that
since
he
found
nothing
but
double-celling
as
a
disadvantage
to
the
prisoners
he
must
have
held
double-celling
was
unconstitutional?
justice
rehnquist
general
adler,
actually,
of
course,
it's
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
we're
reviewing,
which
is
somewhat
perfunctory.
at
a-3
of
the
petition,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"upon
consideration
of
the
record
on
appeal
together
with
the
briefs
and
oral
arguments
of
counsel
the
court
concludes
that
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
are
not
clearly
erroneous
on
this,
that
its
conclusions
of
law
are
permissible
from
the
findings
of
fact.
"
now,
isn't
that
a
somewhat
unusual
statement
from
a
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
a
conclusion
of
law
is
permissible
from
a
finding
of
fact?
doesn't
a
court
of
appeals
ordinarily
say
it's
either
right
or
wrong?
justice
rehnquist
well,
take
this
or
any
opinion
you
lose.
justice
rehnquist
one
has
to
reason
from
the
constitution
in
a
case
like
this,
i
suppose,
and
is
overcrowding
a
synonym
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
just
kind
of
a
synonym
for
finding
the
conditions
as
a
whole
below
some
minimum
standard
of
decency?
justice
rehnquist
well,
can't
one
also
say
that
the
distinction
in
bell
v.
wolfish
cuts
the
other
way
too?
in
that
they
were
simply
pretrial
detainees
who
had
been
convicted
of
nothing
in
bell
v.
wolfish.
whereas,
here,
they're
convicted
and
presumably
are
not
challenging
their
convictions
and
lodged
in
a
maximum
security
institution.
which
by
itself
implies
inconvenience
and
discomfort,
deliberately
so.
that's
what
imprisonment
is.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
prison
offered
no
education
opportunities
at
all,
would
that
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
kamp,
do
you
get
the
feeling
from
the
penultimate
sentence
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
saying
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
not
clearly
erroneous
and
its
conclusions
of
law
are
permissible,
that,
say,
if
this
case
had
come
up
before
judge
rubin
in
dayton
and
he
had
found
exactly
the
same
findings
of
fact
but
held
there
was
no
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
affirmed
him?
justice
rehnquist
but
then
the
penal
systems
of
50
different
states
are
going
to
be
subject
to
the
views
of
93
different
district
federal
judges
in
93
different
districts.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
it's
an
intensely
fact-specific
thing
that
one
judge
could
come
out
one
way
and
one
on
the
other
on
precisely
the
same
facts.
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
some
rule
that
unless
you
do
it
by
stipulation,
to
offer
simply
a
book
in
evidence,
the
opposing
party
has
a
right
to
cross-examine
the
person
who
has
collected
the
statistics
or
arrived
at
the
conclusions?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
you
had
an
american
ex-convict
society
that
said
the
minimum
standards
of
celling
should
be
300
feet
long
and
200
feet
wide?
don't
you
think
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
examine
the
author
of
that?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
some
of
this
complicated
by
the
certification
of
the
matter
as
a
class
action?
if
you
go
back
to
the
weems
case
and
the
"cadena
temporal"
where
they
have
a
very
particularized
description
of
a
punishment
inflicted
on
one
particular
individual
and
he
appealed
and
it
was
found
to
be
cruel
and
unusual.
and
here
what
you
have
is
really
not
so
much
saying
that
a
particular
individual
or
individuals
are
being
cruelly
and
unusually
punished,
as
that
an
institution
is
being
condemned
as
being
capable
of
inflicting,
capable
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
rehnquist
but
yet
there
are
some
who,
as
i
read
the
district
court's
finding,
he
would
not
have
found
as
to
them
as
individuals
that
they
were
suffering
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
rehnquist
but
here
the
district
court
concluded
that
any
reduction
in
the
availability
of
dayrooms
due
to
double-celling
was
not
significant
in
any
respect,
didn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
kind
of
circular
in
a
way,
because
he
seems
to
say
that
because
of
the
overcrowding
the
dayrooms
are
less
attractive
and
then
because
they're
less
attractive
fewer
people
used
them,
and
it's
very
difficult
to
get
a
handle
on.
