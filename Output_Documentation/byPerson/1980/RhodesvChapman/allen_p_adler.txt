mr.
allen
p.
adler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit
for
that
court's
affirmance
of
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
holding
that
double-celling
at
the
southern
ohio
correctional
facility
is
unconstitutional.
the
single
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
double-celling
of
prison
inmates
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
true.
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
not
holding
double-celling
per
se
was
unconstitutional,
but
at
three
or
four
different
places
in
that
opinion
it
held
that
double-celling
was
unconstitutional.
in
the
record
in
the
case
the
judge
states
another
three
or
four
times
that
the
question
before
the
court
is
a
question
of
double-celling.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
well,
he
found
a
few
other
unrelated
things
not
to
be
to
his
liking.
he
found
nothing
in
the
area
of
necessary
services
to
be
deficient.
he
only
found
that
double-celling
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i
definitely
would.
as
i
was
saying,
the
single
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
double-celling
of
prison
inmates
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
where
the
inmates
were
provided
with
reasonably
adequate
food,
clothing,
shelter,
sanitation,
medical
care,
and
personal
safety.
the
district
court
found
socf
to
be
a
top
flight,
first
class
institution,
built
in
the
early
1970s.
it
found
the
institution
to
be
quiet,
light,
and
airy,
the
food
and
food
service
facilities
to
be
completely
adequate.
it
found
the
institution
to
be
comfortable,
not
to
be
hot
or
stuffy.
it
found
no
excessive
noise,
and
few
odors.
the
visitation
facilities
were
more
than
adequate.
there
had
been
no
increase
in
the
level
of
violence
in
the
institution,
the
inmate
to
guard
ratio
was
better
than
that
recommended
by
various
experts,
the
lighting
was
adequate,
the
plumbing
was
adequate.
1,150
inmates
were
working,
426
inmates
were
attending
school.
school
facilities
were
light,
airy,
and
well
equipped.
there
was
a
modern
library
containing
25,000
volumes,
and
the
law
library
was
adequate;
there
was
no
evidence
of
indifference
to
the
inmates'
medical
needs.
medical
care
was
adequate.
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
clothing
was
not
raised,
nor
was
the
question
of
disease
or
illness.
because
the
district
court
found
that
prisoners
at
socf
were
provided
with
all
the
services
necessary
to
maintain
their
lives
and
health,
it
cannot
now
be
argued
that
the
institution
was
unconstitutionally
overcrowded.
it
has
been
argued
that
the
district
court
did
not
end
double-celling
and
therefore
only
reduced
the
inmate
population
to
ameliorate
what
it
saw
to
be
overcrowded
conditions.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
correct.
they
achieved
a
population
of
645
sometime
in
july
of
1979.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
well,
the
inmate
population
of
the
state
of
ohio
since
this
case
has
been
decided
had
gone
up
and
not
down,
so
we
have
more
of
a
problem
now
on
a
statewide
basis
than
we
did
at
the
time.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
correct.
it's
the
only
adequate
maximum
security
institution
the
state
has.
and
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried
the
state
of
ohio
felt,
or
the
administrators
felt,
that
they
had
2,300
maximum
security
prisoners.
by
reducing
that
population
that
would
mean
maximum
security
prisoners
in
the
medium
security
institutions,
which
has
heightened
problems
in
those
institutions.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i
would
much
prefer
if
they
would
say
either
it's
right
or
its
wrong.
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
was
very
disappointed
in
that
opinion,
contrasting
with
all--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--well,
in
contrast
with
the
recent
opinion
that
came
out
of
the
state
of
colorado,
an
opinion
of
the
10th
circuit
that
ran
on
for,
i
think,
80-some
pages,
this
case
was
dealt
with
in
less
than
a
page
and
a
half.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
possibly.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
if
my
memory
serves
me,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--if
my
memory
serves
me,
he
may
have
taken
judicial
notice
of
that.
i
do
not
remember
that
being
introduced
as
an
exhibit,
and
i
don't
remember
oral
testimony
on
that.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
my
opinion
is
that
they
should
be
treated
for
what
they
are.
they
are
desires.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
absolutely.
and
those
opinions
have
changed
over
the
years.
i
checked
the
american
correctional
association
standards.
in
1946
they
required
75
square
feet
per
inmate
counting
cells,
day
room
areas,
exercise
areas,
and
hallways.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
well,
my
suggestion
would
be
that
where
it
can
be
shown
that
because
of
the
lack
of
floor
space
there
is
a
deprivation
in
one
of
these
areas,
these
core
areas...
sanitation,
personal
safety,
shelter,
that's
where
the
cutoff
should
be,
and
not
just
because
someone
picked
60
feet
out
of
the
air
and
sets
that
as
a
minimum
standard.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i'm
no
expert
in
that
area
and
i,
like
i
say,
i
could
make
no
suggestion.
as
i
stated,
i
personally--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--as
i
stated,
our
prison
administrators
desired
single-cell
inmates
at
lucasville
in
63
or
68
square
feet.
that's
their
desire.
they
would
love
to
live
with
the
standard.
but
the
present
population,
due
to
the
present
population,
they
cannot.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
they
would
like
to
single-cell,
they
would
desire
to
single-cell,
if
it
were
at
all
possible.
their
position
is
that
double-celling
inmates
in
that
institution
was
the
best
alternative
to
single-celling
inmates
in
that
institution.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i
think
that's
what
they're
paid
to
do.
i'm
sure
that
when
they
have
problems
that's--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--probably
around
34
feet
inside
the
cells,
but
that
doesn't
take--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--that's
not
desirable;
no.
they
do
not
desire
to
double-cell
that
institution.
they
would
much
rather
have
that
institution
single-celled.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
my
position.
if
desires
are
a
constitutional
minimum,
i
think
we're
all
in
a
lot
of
trouble.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
it
was
designed
with
620
cells
in
the
institution
proper.
now,
there
is
a--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--1,620.
sixteen
hundred.
and
there
are
now
2,300?
there
were
2,300
at
the
time
of
trial.
now,
we
brought
on
the
consulting
architect,
a
gentleman
named
robert
barnes,
who
was
employed
by
the
federal
system
for
years.
and
mr.
barnes'
testimony
was
that
he
never
designed
any
institution
to
hold
any
specific
number
of
people,
and
to
back
up
what
he
said,
he
pointed
out
that
all
the
support
facilities
in
the
institution,
if
the
population
was
supposed
to
be
1,620,
all
the
support
facilities
were
overdesigned.
currently,
this
institution
has
two
dining
rooms.
one
is
all
but
shut
down.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
lucasville
is
about
90
miles
south
of
columbus.
it's
near
portsmouth,
ohio.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
right.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
no,
it
is
not.
it
was
all
but
closed
as
a
result
of
this
order.
it
was...
and...
also,
the
increase
in
population,
it
was
necessary
to
reopen
the
ohio
penitentiary
and
i
believe
they
topped
the
population
out
there
somewhere
around
1,700.
we
have
since
agreed
to
close
the
ohio
penitentiary
by
january
1,
1983.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
the
penitentiary
has
been
on
that
site
for
more
than
100
years;
probably
the
oldest
building
on
that
site
must
be
close
to
100
years
old
by
now.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that
was
a
maximum
security
institution
when
it
was
in
operation
and
parts
of
it
still
are
maximum
security.
other
parts
are
medium.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
ohio's
been
classifying
since
about
1932,
i
believe.
ohio,
i
might
add,
has
also
launched
a
building
program.
they
have
the
seed
money,
the
planning
money,
to
put
up
six
new
institutions.
the
state
legislature
hasn't
as
yet
funded
the
building
but
the
plans
are
being
drawn.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
marysville.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
yes.
that's
still
there.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
no,
at
lima.
although
that's
soon
to
be
closed
down.
they're
moving
that
operation
around.
there
is
also
a...
well,
there
are
many
medium
facilities
at
marion,
lima,
chillicothe--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--yes.
and
the
old
mansfield
reformatory
for
younger
offenders.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
lebanon.
and
they've
just
taken
over
the
boys'
industrial
school
in
lancaster
as
a
reformatory-type
operation.
because
the
district
court
found
the
prisoners
at
socf
were
provided
with
all
the
services
necessary
to
maintain
their
lives
and
health,
it
cannot
not
now
be
argued
that
the
institution
was
unconstitutionally
overcrowded.
it
has
been
argued
that
the
district
court
did
not
end
double-celling,
therefore,
only
reduced
the
inmate
population
to
alleviate
what
it
saw
to
be
overcrowded
conditions.
but
the
court
never
found
socf
to
be
unconstitutionally
overcrowded.
it
did
find
double-celling
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
took
no
action
to
remedy
other
conditions
it
found
objectionable
but
only
ordered
the
inmate
population
reduced
to
what
the
court
perceived
as
the
single-cell
capacity
of
the
institution,
thereby
insuring
that
each
inmate
had
private
sleeping
quarters.
the
institution
contained
1,620
cells
measuring
variously
63
square
feet
and
68-1/4
square
feet.
there
are
more
than
20
acres
under
one
roof.
at
the
time
of
trial
socf
had
approximately
2,300
inmates.
although
it
was
claimed
that
socf
was
overcrowded
because
of
a
great
number
of
conditions,
including
double-celling,
the
court
found
deficiencies
in
only
four
areas:
jobs;
a
delay
in
education,
the
number
of
social
workers
and
psychologists
had
not
increased
along
with
the
population
of
the
institution;
and
it
found
some
past
deficiencies
in
the
area
of
dental
care.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
assuming
this
case
was
decided
in
the
way
other
cases
have
been
decided,
the
courts
have
held
that
the
institutions
are
unconstitutionally
overcrowded.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
what
we're
asking.
our
position
is
that
there
are
no
parameters
on
which
to
decide
these
cases.
a
judge
can
conceivably
take
any
combination
of
conditions,
put
them
together,
say
i've
applied
the
totality
of
conditions
test,
and
find
the
institutional
unconstitutional
or
find
the
inmates
are
being
deprived
of
their
rights
beneath
the
minimum.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
all
of
them
do.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
right.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
the
way
i
read
it
is
that
the
district
court
found
the
institution
to
be
unconstitutional.
they
never
found
the
institution
to
be
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
he
mentions
the
eighth
amendment
in
the
preface
to
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
but
at
the
end
simply
finds
the
practice
of
double-celling
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i
would
have
to
go--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--absolutely.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
"under
all
circumstances".
i
believe
they
finish
with
that
phrase.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
well,
i
think
that
language
comes
right
out
of
the
decision
itself,
where
judge
hogan
says,
i
don't
find
it
unconstitutional
under
all
circumstances,
just
the
ones
before
me.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
correct.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
correct.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
no,
they
were
saying
the
district
court
never
found
any
condition
or
combination--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--it
can
be
the
only
basis.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
it
can
be
the
only
basis
for--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--i
would;
i
would.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
given
the
proper
hypothetical
case
and
the
proper
real
case,
i
am
sure
that
sooner
or
later
i
would
agree.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
okay.
our
position
is
that
the
line
between
the
two
extremes
is
this.
in
bell
v.
wolfish
this
court
dealt
with
what
was
described
as
inconvenience
and
discomfort.
and
that's
all
that
shows
on
this
record,
inconvenience
and
discomfort.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
in
this
case?
no,
sir.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
no,
sir.
there
was
no
increase
in
the
rate
of
violence.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
correct.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
right.
it
was
proportional
to
the
population.
if
there
had
been
two
different
institutions
with
half
of
2,300
inmates
in
each,
we
would
have
had
the
same
violence
or
expected
the
same
violence.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
well,
that's
what
i
was
getting
to.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
in
wolfish
and
here,
there
is
only
inconvenience
and
discomfort.
now,
the
court
seems
to
hold--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--that's
true,
but
it's
still
only
inconvenience
and
discomfort.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
we're
talking
about
average
sentences
in
that
institution
of
about
28
or
29
months.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
absolutely.
going
to
jail
is
an
inconvenience
and
it's
a
discomfort.
now,
i
think
you
have
to
have
something
more
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
and
if
my
reading
of
bell
v.
wolfish
is
correct,
and
you
certainly
know
if
it
is
or
it
isn't,
i
read
bell
to
say
that
privation
and
hardship
carried
out
over
an
extended
period
of
time
may
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
but
here
we
don't
have
the
privation
and
hardship.
so
my
question
then
is,
does
the
extended
period
of
time
make
a
difference?
since
we're
only
talking
about
an
inconvenience
and
discomfort.
now,
the
district
court
did
not
find
double-celling
to
be
per
se
unconstitutional
but
found
it
to
be
unconstitutional
when
it
was
combined
with
factors
that
naturally
flowed
from
the
practice
of
double-celling
or
from
the
fact
of
imprisonment.
the
court
found
that
the
inmates
were
long-term.
well,
they
were
prison
inmates,
and
they
were
convicted
of
felonies.
the
court
found
that
the
population
was
greater
than
the
number
of
cells
in
the
institution.
obvious.
it
also
found
that
the
average
floor
space
available
to
each
inmate
in
each
cell
was
half,
and
it
found
the
practice
of
double-celling
to
have
been
of
long-term
duration.
the
court's
fifth
finding,
that
most
double-celled
inmates
spend
most
of
their
time
in
their
cells
directly
contradicts
the
evidence
in
the
case,
and
the
court's
previous
finding
that
75
percent
of
the
inmates
can
be
out
of
their
cells
from
6:30
in
the
morning
to
9:30
at
night.
that's
15
hours
each
and
every
day.
so,
in
fact,
most
double-celled
inmates
were
out
of
their
cells
most
of
the
day.
now,
the
question
of
double-celling
inmates...
the
question
here
simply
boils
down
to,
does
a
prison
inmate
have
a
right
to
private
sleeping
quarters?
and
it's
our
position
that
the
answer
must
be
no.
two
or
more
people
sharing
a
room
is
commonly
practiced
in
our
homes,
on
college
campuses,
in
our
hospitals,
nursing
homes,
and
in
the
military.
the
question
of
double-celling
prison
inmates
has
been
dealt
with
by
four
other
federal
appellate
courts.
it
has
been
found
to
be
constitutional
in
each
case.
those
courts
have
held
that
double-celling
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional,
and
only
rises
to
a
constitutional
question
where
it
contributes
to
the
overcrowding
of
the
institution.
at
least
two
of
these
courts
have
defined
overcrowding
as
a
condition
where
those
things
necessary
to
the
maintaining
of
health
and
safety
of
the
inmates
are
denied.
those
things
are
adequate
medical
care,
food,
shelter,
clothing,
sanitation,
and
personal
safety.
and
the
courts
below
found
no
denials
in
those
areas.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
it
did
find
that
the
number
of
jobs
in
the
institution
had
been
watered
down.
now,
they
had
been
increased,
the
number
of
jobs
had
been
increased,
along
with
the
population.
but
they
were
watered
down.
two
inmates
doing
the
same
job,
in
some
case.
they
found
a
wait
for
education.
he
found
no
denial
in
the
area
of
education
but
he
found
a
wait
for
education
to
somehow
be
less
than
standard.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
well,
i
found
these
particular
findings
by
judge
hogan
to
particularly
strange
because
in
december,
1976,
he
ruled
that
prison
inmates
have
no
right
to
education,
social
services,
or
jobs.
and
then
he
tells
us
that
we're
not
giving
them
immediate
educations
and
therefore
we're
wrong.
and
i
would
assume
that
if
you
gave
them
no
education
at
all,
you'd
be
running
a
constitutional
institution.
and
as
far
as
the
wait
for
education
goes,
i
don't
think
anyone
gets
an
immediate
education.
i
mean,
schools
start
in
september
and
end
in
june.
if
there
aren't
any
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
just
a
few
things,
your
honor.
first,
i
again
need
to
point
out
that
judge
hogan
never
found
conditions
at
southern
ohio
correctional
facility
to
be
cruel
and
unusual,
nor
did
he
find
any
condition
in
that
institution
that
shocked
his
conscience.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
if
it's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i
think
someone's
got--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
someone's
conscience
has
to
be
shocked.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
but
again,
nowhere
in
judge
hogan's
opinion
does
he
find
anything
that
shocks
his
conscience
or
that
he
considers
barbarous
treatment.
nowhere.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
that's
true;
very
true.
now...
mrs.
kamp
has
referred
to
physical
and
mental
injuries
as
a
result
of
a
double-celling.
now,
four
psychologists
and
a
physician
testified
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
none
of
those
five
men
knew
of
any
relationship
between
double-celling,
crowding,
and
any
increase
in
violence.
also,
i'd
like
to
address
the
ama
standards,
since
there's
never
been
an
epidemic
at
the
southern
ohio
correctional
facility,
and
if
some
mental
damage
was
done
these
prisoners,
that
damage
did
not
manifest
itself
in
any
way.
there
was
no
increase
in
behavioral
problems,
there
was
no
increase
in
violence,
and
there
has
never
been
a
riot
in
that
institution.
now,
as
to
space
standards,
one
of
the
organizations
cited
is
the
american
correctional
association.
now,
also
appearing
as
a
witness
in
this
case
was
a
mr.
seigler--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--i
would
hope
so,
as
long
as
they
could
prove
no
harm
has
resulted.
i'm
sure
if
they
alleged
that
a
specific
harm
has
resulted
from
the
practice,
that
we'd
be
back
in
court
on
that
question--
mr.
allen
p.
adler
--i
assume
that
it
would
be
a
whole
new
case.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
yes.
it
did
go
on
for
some
two
years.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
coming
at
this
question
from
the
other
end,
that
institution,
as
i
stated
before,
since
august
of
1979
we've
been
down
to
that
1,645.
the
incidents
of
violence
haven't
decreased,
the
behavior
problems
haven't
gotten
any
better.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
and
there's
a
slight
increase
in
one
area.
mr.
allen
p.
adler
i've
talked
to
prison
administrators
in
other
states
and
they
feel
the
same
way
you
do,
although
i
can't
say
that
of
ours.
now,
mr.
seigler
when
he
was
asked
if
he
knew
of
the
american
correctional
association
standards,
he
said,
no,
that
he
didn't.
also
testifying
in
this
case
was
mr.
norman
carlson,
who
is
the
current
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons.
at
the
time
he
testified
he
was
the
president-elect
of
the
american
correctional
association,
and
he
testified
that
he
didn't
know
what
the
american
correctional
association
standards
were,
and
when
asked
about
another
set
of
standards
on
which
his
name
appeared,
he
stated
that
he
did
not
help
formulate
those
standards
and
that
he
disagreed
with
them.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
judge
hogan
never
found
15
percent
of
the
inmates
at
socf
to
be
schizophrenic.
he
did
find
that
a
doctor
named
lindner
had
testified
to
that
fact.
he
issued
no
finding
at
all
in
that
area.
as
for
the
time
out
of
cells,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below
put
on
an
inmate
named
anders.
and
on
159
of
the
transcript
of
this
case
he
testified
that
he
was
permitted
out
of
his
cell
from
6:30
in
the
morning
to
9:30
at
night,
which
completely
matches
the
schedules
that
were
also
put
in
the
evidence
as
plaintiff's
exhibit
8
in
the
court
below,
also
demonstrating
that
the
dayrooms
are
open
from
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
9:30
in
the
evening.
thank
you
very
much.
