was
built
in
the

designed
to
house

many

justice
stewart
well,
it
has
to...
i
would
suppose,
maybe
your
sister
can
tell
us
otherwise,
but
i
would
suppose
that
he
must
have
found
that
it
violated
the
eighth
amendment's
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
justice
stewart
i
can't
think
of
any
other
basis
on
which
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
maybe
we'll
be
informed--
justice
stewart
--educated
by
your
sister.
but--
--well,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
said,
we
do
not
read,
we
do
not
read
the
district
court
holding
that
double-celling
is
unconstitutional.
so
notwithstanding
the
district
court's
apparent
finding
of
unconstitutionality,
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
read
it
that
way.
justice
stewart
well,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
understood
this
case
as
being
an
eighth
amendment
case,
as
the
first
sentence
of
the
per
curiam
opinion
indicates
clearly.
justice
stewart
"this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
finding
certain
conditions
at
a
state
prison
to
violate
the
eighth
amendment
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
"
and
that's
the
only
basis
on
which
it
could
have
been
found
unconstitutional,
i
think--
justice
stewart
--as
presently
advised.
justice
stewart
and
that
would
always
be
a
matter
of
degree.
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
would
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
not
only
overcrowding,
but
lack
of
ventilation
and
lack
of
light,
and
maybe
lack
of
food.
justice
stewart
your
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
then,
was
quite
different
from
yours,
because
the
court
of
appeals
begins
its
short
per
curiam
opinion
with
a
statement
that
the
trial
court
did
find
certain
conditions
at
a
state
prison
that
violate
the
eight
amendment
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
begins,
at
this
first
sentence.
