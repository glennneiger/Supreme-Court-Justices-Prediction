mr.
jean
p.
kamp
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
judge
here
found
that
confinement
of
two
men
in
a
63-square-foot
cell
in
the
totality
of
conditions
which
existed
at
lucasville
caused
physical
and
mental
injury
from
long
exposure
and
therefore
violated
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
findings
of
fact,
as
was
quoted
earlier.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
saying
that
the
district
court
did
not
hold
that
double-celling
per
se
was
unconstitutional,
but
rather
that
under
the
specific
factual
findings
made
about
conditions
existing
at
that
institution,
the
double-celling
was
unconstitutional
and
that
the
remedy
of
reducing
population
was
therefore
proper.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
your
honor,
totality
of
conditions
test
is
a
test--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--i
think
it
did,
your
honor.
it
found
that
double-celling
was
not
per
se
unconstitutional,
just
as
the
district
court
had
done.
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
that
double-celling
in
the
conditions
existing
at
lucasville,
for
the
period
of
time
they'd
existed
there,
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
your
honor,
if
all
of
the
conditions
at
the
southern
ohio
correctional
facility
violate
the
eight
amendment
and
a
method
of
ending
the
constitutional
violation
is
to
reduce
the
population,
then,
yes,
i
would
submit
that
this
is
exactly
like
hutto
v.
finney;
that
you're
taking
a
series
of
unconstitutional
conditions
which
together
make
an
unconstitutional
whole,
taking
the
least
possible
intrusive
remedies
to
make
again
a
constitutional
institution.
i
think
the
6th
circuit
held
that
that
was
what
the
trial
judge
had
done
here.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i
think,
reading
the
6th
circuit
decision,
they
might
well
have.
it's
a
time
and
totality
of
conditions
test,
is
a
very
factual
and
intensive
test,
and
to
the
facts
found
here
which
are
not
seriously
in
dispute
about
the
length
of
time
in
cell,
the
length
of
time
of
confinement,
the
physical
and
mental
injury
caused
by
the
confinement,
the
correct
standard
is
clearly
erroneous
as
applied.
now,
as
to
whether
the
totality
of
those
conditions
reach
an
eight
amendment
standard,
that's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
it's
the
kind
of
question
which
i
think
district
courts
are
particularly
an
appropriate
forum
to
be
deciding.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
your
honor,
because
all
of
them
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
eight
amendment
has
been
violated,
which
means
a
finding
whether,
under
the
totality
of
conditions,
the
plaintiffs
have
been
able
to
show
an
unnecessary
infliction
of
suffering
or--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--well,
your
honor,
there
could
never
be
precisely
the
same
facts.
i
think
the
four
cases
referred
to
by
my
opponent
here
show
that
courts
looking
at
different
prisons
with
somewhat
similar
conditions
have
come
out
with
different
results.
that's
correct.
they've
looked
at
the
totality
of
conditions,
they've
determined
whether
that
totality
in
fact
caused
genuine
privation
and
hardship,
violate
contemporary
standards
of
decency.
if
the
answer
was
yes,
then
it
was
an
eight
amendment
violation.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
your
honor,
it's
so.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
well,
there
are
some
punishments,
we
would
submit,
that
are
so
cruel
as
to
by
themselves
violate
the
constitution,
such
as
hanging
by
the
thumbs,
such
as
housing
people
in
14
square
feet,
as
was
mentioned
earlier.
but
that's
not
what
the
judge
here
did.
he
looked
at
all
of
the
conditions
together
and
found
that
double-celling
as
practiced
in
this
particular
institution
did
violate
the
eight
amendment,
and
therefore
he
didn't
need
to
reach
that.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
well,
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
could
talk
about
what
the
circumstances
were
that
i
think
the
trial
judge
relied
on--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
your
honor,
on
that
page
he's
referring
to
the
third
of
the
factors
which
he
considered
crucial
to
the
decision
in
the
totality
of
circumstances.
specifically,
he
was
referring
to
the
size
of
the
cell,
63
square
feet;
as
long,
perhaps,
as
this
table,
and
perhaps
twice
as
wide.
he
was
pointing
out
that
no
contemporary
standard
accepts
that
kind
of
cell
for
two
people,
that's
it's
been
found
in
all
of
these--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
your
honor,
i
think
it's
extremely
appropriate
to
rely
on
such
standards.
the
medical
profession
in
the
ama
brief,
which
has
been
filed
amicus
here,
shows
the
reasons
for
these
standards
have
been
developed,
not
as
utopian
ideals
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
they've
been
developed
because
the
medical
profession
has
found
that
you
need
a
certain
amount
of
space
in
order
to
preserve
mental
and
physical
health.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
well,
what
the
trial
judge
did
here,
he
found
that
in
light
of
the
length
of
time
people
were
in
the
cells
both
on
a
daily
basis
and
over
the
long
term,
that
50
square
feet
would
be
constitutionally
required
in
order
to
comply
with
this
kind
of
standard
and
and
protect
the
mental
and
physical
health
of
the
prisoners
in
the
institution.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
court's
findings--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--i
did
not
participate
in
the
trial.
my
understanding
is
that
the
briefs
did
submit
these
standards
of
which
50
is
the
minimum.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
part
of
the
briefs.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
and
that
in
the
6th
circuit
some
of
the
standards
which
have
been
developed
since
were
also
presented
to
the
6th
circuit.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i'm
not
aware
of
any
of
that
kind
of
evidence,
although
i
am
aware
now
because
of
the
ama
brief
about
the
army
standard,
which
requires
a
minimum
of
70
square
feet
and
it
says
that
if
you
have
to
go
below
that
on
an
emergency
basis
for
more
than
a
week,
you're
going
to
have
to
assume
that
you're
going
to
have
increased
disease
and
increased
disciplinary
problems.
i
think
the
court's
finding
of
that
was
true,
certainly
not
clearly
erroneous,
as
simply
!
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
your
honor,
to
be
honest,
the
is
the
first
challenge
i've
heard
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
court
considering
the
contemporary
standards
of
decency
which
are
put
out
by
organizations
such
as
the
american
correctional
association--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--i
would
expect
them
to
challenge
those.
they
have
never
challenged
the
fact
that
these
are
the
standards
of
reputable
organizations
and
that
they're
based
on
sociological
studies
and
medical
and
public
health
evidence
which
is
available
and
common
knowledge.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
country
lucasville
is
not
alone
in
being
overcrowded
and
in
being
double-celled,
and
that's
clearly
why
we
think
this
is
such
an
important
case,
that
the
district
court
has
to
look
at
the
prison
to
see
if
the
fact,
if
the--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--under
the
conditions
existing
in
the
particular
institution,
your
honor.
okay,
if
i
could
perhaps
get
back
to
the
factors
which
he
found
did
lead
to
it.
these
were
people
who
were
serving
sentences
of
four
to
25
years
or
life,
two-thirds
of
them.
this
had
been
going
on
for
two
years;
it
was
expected
to
go
on
indefinitely.
there
was
no
indication
that
the
state
had
any
intention
of
stopping
at
double-celling
or
triple-celling,
for
that
matter,
and
as
was
just
said,
ohio
had
no
limit
it
had
set
for
itself
on
the
amount
of
space
per
person.
inmates
were
in
these
cells
for
most
of
the
day
with
their
cellmates.
this
was
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
who
held
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
inmates
will
be
in
their
cells
for
most
of
the
day
with
their
cellmates.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
what
we're
saying
here
is
not
that
the
punishment
is
disproportionate
in
the
weems
sense,
but
that
as
a
method
of
punishment
it
is
cruel
and
unusual
because
of
the
way
it
impacts
on
the
class
of
people
who
are
housed
there.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
that's
certainly
true.
there
were
approximately
300
people
who
were
never
double-celled
and
who
had
never
been
at
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
and
you're
right,
there
were
some
who
were
out
and
who
were
in
school
and
job
programs
who
might
perhaps...
he
did,
however,
find
that
80
percent
of
the
population
could
be
expected
to
suffer
from
some
sort
of
mental
or
emotional
disorder
and
that
those
conditions
would
be
aggravated
by
double-celling
in
the
sense
of
increasing
aggressive
behavior,
increasing
tension,
increasing
violence
in
a
fixed
space,
even
though
not
geometric.
he
also
found
that
approximately
15
percent
of
the
population
was
schizophrenic
and
that
for
these
people
it
was
extremely
cruel.
the
evidence
indicated
that
for
schizophrenics
to
be
in
situations
like
this
in
a
14-hour-day
lockup
causes
withdrawal
to
the
point
of
sometimes
even
suicide.
so
he
was
looking
at
all
of
the
conditions.
there
was
no
classification
in
this
institution.
the
schizophrenics
were
not
housed
separately
from
the
other
inmates,
nor
were
they
given
more
time
out
of
their
cell,
or
given
single
cells,
for
that
matter.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
your
honor.
i
think
they
are
consistent.
i
think
the
first
set
of
findings
refer
to
the
fact
that
on
paper
the
dayrooms
were
open
between
9
in
the
morning
and
9:30
at
night
and
that
inmates
did
leave
their
cells
prior
to
9
for
breakfast.
he
later
finds
that
because
of
the
maximum
security
nature
of
the
prison,
the
fact
that
there's,
you
know,
essentially
no
freedom
of
movement
within
the
institution,
the
cell
doors
are
only
opened
once
every
hour
for
movement
back
and
forth;
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
inmates
were
required
to
spend
14
hours
a
day
in
their
cells
with
their
cellmates.
and
i
think
the
trial
judge
recognized
three
or
four
different
times
in
the
decision
the
importance
of
the
factor
of
time
in
cell,
and
his
conclusion
is
that
the
evidence
shows
that
most
inmates
are
in,
or,
all
inmates,
are
in
their
cells
most
of
the
time
with
their
cellmates.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
that
on
the
average
they
would
be
out
approximately
ten
hours.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
of
the
three-quarters
of
the
population
who
had
that
privilege.
of
course
one-quarter
of
the
double-celled
population,
which
involved
about
320
cells,
were
locked
in
their
cells,
essentially
all
of
the
time,
allowed
out
either
two,
four,
six
hours
a
week.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
you're
right.
the
general
population
were
the
three-quarters
that
had
some
freedom
of
movement.
the
other
quarter
were
the
people
who
were
in
protective
custody
or
were
in
what
was
called
voluntary
idle.
as
we
heard,
there
were
not
enough
jobs
available
in
the
institution.
i
think
the
distinction
between
this
kind
of
prison
system
and
a
per
se
rule
which
judge
hogan
rejected
can
be
seen
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
which
has
been
set
forth
in
the
memorandum
filed
by
the
united
states
justice
department.
there
they
also
double-cell,
but
they
only
do
it
with
five
percent
of
the
population.
of
the
people
who
were
in
this--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--no,
your
honor,
because
there's
a
different
totality
of
conditions.
five
percent
in
an
uncrowded
institution
where
services
are
available
for
a
shorter
period
of
time
because
you
don't
have
all
of
the
cells
double-celled,
is
a
completely
different
situation
from
the
institution
where
double-celling
is
increasing
all
the
time,
where
most
people
are
in
their
cells
most
of
the
time,
where
there
are
minimal
social-psychological
and
that
kind
of
services.
five
percent
overcrowding
is
something
that
can
be
dealt
with
totally
differently
than
a
40
percent
overcrowding
as
here,
or
potentially,
of
course,
much
worse.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
well,
no,
your
honor.
in
the
federal
system
eight-tenths
of
one
percent--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--i'm
saying,
if
you're
referring
to
lucasville,
it's
much
more
than
sleeping.
it's,
as
the
trial
court
found,
about
14
hours
a
day,
but
of
course
he'd
be
in
his
cell
with
his
cellmate.
so
this
is
not
like
bell
v.
wolfish
where
you
were
talking
about
seven
or
eight
hours
a
day,
or
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
where
for
most
of
them
they
were
talking
about
anywhere
from
five
to
eight
or
nine
hours
a
day.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
he
did
find
that
with
respect
to
conditions
in
the
dayroom.
that's
correct.
he
clearly
considered
that
in
his
finding
that
most
prisoners
were
in
their
cells,
all
prisoners,
for
14
hours
a
day
or
more.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
well,
your
honor,
i
think
all
of
that
goes
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
maximum
security
prison,
where
there
is
so
little
freedom
of
movement,
wherever
you
go
there's
a
threat
of
violence
of
the
kind
of
assault,
homosexual
behavior,
rape,
that
he
did
refer
to
as
increasing.
but
this
is
not
like
the
mcc
in
new
york
where
people
could
just
wander
in
and
out
of
their
cells
back
and
forth
to
a
dayroom.
i
think
that's
how
you
make
it
consistent.
this,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
is
one
of
many,
many
cases
where
conditions
in
a
prison
have
been
challenged.
and
this
court
in
hutto
v.
finney
impliedly
approved
the
test
used
by
the
district
court
there
of
totality
of
circumstances.
that
is
the
test
which
has
been
asserted
by
essentially
every
court,
every
lower
court,
that's
dealt
with
the
matter
since
then.
and
that
it's
a
workable
test.
but
this
court
should
not
say
that
65
square
feet
is
always
okay,
or
that
it's
never
okay,
or
that
40
square
feet
is
always
or
never,
or
any
square
footage.
but
this
is
the
kind
of
question
that
has
to
be
viewed
by
the
district
court
taking
into
account
that
the
eighth
amendment
prohibits
unnecessary
infliction
of
pain
and
violation
of
contemporary
standards
of
decency;
that
those
are
standards
which
can
be
reviewed;
that
the
district
court
here
made
explicit
findings
as
to
unnecessary
injury,
the
violation
of
contemporary
standards
of
decency,
and
that
therefore
should
be
affirmed,
because
those
findings
are
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i
think
they're
extremely
relevant
to
contemporary
standards
of
decency.
they
show
the
range
in
which
the
medical
profession,
the
public
health
professions,
and
the
correctional
experts
have
seen
as
necessary
to
run
a
constitutional...
or
adequate
prison.
now,
that's
not
clearly
the
same
as
saying
they
defined
the
constitutional
limits.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
certainly
not,
and
they--
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
--no.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i
think
the
medical
profession
tells
us
what
is
necessary
to
preserve
health.
the
eight
amendment
tells
us
whether
that
standard
is
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
here
found
mental
and
physical
injury
from
long
exposure
to
these
conditions.
there
are
specific
findings
about
psychological
harm
done
to
the
schizophrenic
population
and
to
the
rest
of
the
population
insofar
as
it
caused
increased
acting-out
behavior.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
yes,
your
honor.
the
decision
specifically
refers
to
increased
acting-out
behavior,
increased
tension.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
the
district
court.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
the
court
of
appeals,
though,
affirmed
as
not
clearly
erroneous
those
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
no,
your
honor,
we
accepted
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court.
mr.
jean
p.
kamp
i'm
sorry...
yes,
of
course,
we
have
to
accept
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
do
stand
by
that
decision.
in
summary
i
want
to
say
that
the
state
has
asked
the
court
to
adopt
a
test
similar
to
the
language
in
newman
v.
alabama
of
minimum
necessities.
we
would
submit
that
that's
the
same
test
we're
talking
about
here,
that
the
totality
of
conditions
requires
that
you
look
at
all
of
the
particular
conditions
within
an
institution
and
determine
whether
it
violates
the
eight
amendment,
and
that
the
place
to
make
that
decision
is
in
the
district
courts.
thank
you.
