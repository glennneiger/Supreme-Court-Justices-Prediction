justice
white
well,
on
that
basis
you
might
say
that
the
10th
circuit
was
50
times
as
wrong?
justice
white
well,
wasn't
the
only
factor
here
that
the
court
fastened
on
was
the
double-celling?
did
it
find
any
other
aspects
of
the
prison
life
unsatisfactory?
justice
white
no
one
suggests,
though,
that
they
represent
what
is
usual
around
the
country.
justice
white
is
it
cruel...
to
see
and
decide
whether
it's
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
white
why
would
he
have
done
that?
there
is
no
test
like
that,
is
there?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
talking
of
conscience,
is
that
the
test
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
