mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
pursuant
to
a
decision
written
by
justice
douglas
for
a
unanimous
court
in
the
original
and
forerunner
of
this
case,
illinois
v.
milwaukee,
is
a
federal
question
case.
the
court,
through
justice
douglas,
enunciated
both
a
basic
principle
and
set
the
stage
for
the
question
that
is
now
before
the
court.
the
basic
principle?
that
federal
law
controls
the
rights
and
obligations
of
discharges
to
interstate
waters,
where
the
same
are
called
into
question
in
an
interstate
dispute,
and
such
federal
law
controls
to
the
exclusion
of
state
law.
the
federal
law
at
the
time
of
this
court's
initial
decision
was
common
law,
primarily
because
of
the
absence
of
a
complete
and
effective
statutory
scheme
covering
the
same
subject
matter.
the
stage
was
set
for
the
question
of
the
effect
of
subsequently
enacted
legislation
on
that
statutory
law
by
justice
douglas.
he
first
acknowledged
that
federal
law
excluded
state
law.
and
then
he
talked
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
preemption
of
the
federal
common
law
by
federal
statutory
law.
note
that
he
spoke
of
preemption
of
federal
common
law
by
federal
statutory
law.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
he
said
it
might
happen.
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
he
spoke
in
terms
of
a
preemption
of
federal
law.
it's
not
the
context
in
which
we
usually
look
at
the
word,
preemption.
the
word,
preemption,
is
usually
thought
of
in
terms
of
federal
law
overriding
state
law
or
occupying
the
field
in
such
a
way
so
that
the
state
law
and
other
law
cannot
operate
there.
here
justice
douglas,
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court,
spoke
in
terms
of
federal
legislation
displacing
or
preempting
federal
common
law.
his
exact
language
was:
"new
federal
laws
and
new
federal
regulations
may
in
time
preempt
the
field
of
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
"
and
we
have
the
citation
at
page
7
of
our
brief.
in
this
frame
of
reference,
the
present
federal
water
pollution
control
act
amendments
of
1972,
modified
in
1977
by
the
clear
water
act...
the
two
i
will
speak
of
as
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act,
was
adopted.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
would
have
that
power
constitutionally
under
the
federal
system
that
we
have,
because
that
would
then
lead
the
states
to
legislate
one
against
the
other
in
an
area
where
there
is
a
paramount
federal
interest.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
well,
whether
congress
said
so
or
not,
i
think
this
court
has
held
several
times
in
this
type
of
a
controversy
between
states,
either
in
apportionment
of
waters
or
utilization
of
waters
or,
i
submit,
the
pollution
of
waters,
this
is
a
paramount
federal
interest
where
you
have
interstate
waters.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
submit
that
whether
it
be
state
against
state
or
state
against
citizen,
or
citizen
against
state
or
citizen
against
citizen,
where
we
are
crossing
the
boundaries
and
a
state
has
a
particular
interest,
two
states
have
a
particular
interest
in
waters
crossing
the
boundary,
that
the
federal
interest
there
is
so
paramount
that
congress
could
not
abdicate
under
the
constitution.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
reading
it
in
that
precise
way.
i'm
reading
it
in
terms
of
congress
may,
in
regulations
adopted
under
congress's
acts,
may
in
time
preempt.
i
don't
think
that
justice
douglas
was
saying,
as
soon
as
they
enter
the
field
at
all,
they
have
thereby
excluded
completely
the
common
law.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
federal
legislation,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
regulations
under
that
federal
legislation,
to
that
extent
the
common
law
would
be
preempted.
in
other
words,
the
statute,
the
regulations
control
the
common
law,
rather
than
totally
displace
it
as
soon
as
congress
wants
into
the
area.
and
it
was
in
this
frame
of
reference
that
the
federal
water
pollution
control
acts
were
written.
and
because
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act,
the
courts
are
no
longer
free
to
walk
into
the
area
and
operate
as
they
were
before
those
enactments
and
fashion
their
own
remedies,
their
own
law,
in
relationship
to
interstate
water
pollution,
but
rather
are
controlled
by
the
congressional
act
and
the
regulations
adopted
thereunder,
to
the
extent
that
they
exist.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
it's
the
same
kind
of
a
preemption,
i
believe,
but
here
we're
dealing,
because
we're
in
the
same
sovereign
and
the
legislature
is
dealing
with
something
on
a
policy
level,
where
the
courts
are
dealing
with
it
in
the
absence
of
legislation,
i
think
that
the
legislation
of
congress
controls
the
activity
and
the
conduct
of
the
courts
in
a
different
way
than
a
total
displacement
that
you
would
have,
congressional
act
as
against
state
enactment.
we
are
here
primarily
because,
as
we
view
it,
the
courts
below
have
not
followed
the
mandates
of
congress
in
the
regulations
in
connection
with
the
suit
brought
by
illinois
against
these
defendants.
two
sections
of
the
act
are
relied
on
and
analyzed
in
considering
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
act
on
other
law
in
the
general
sense.
those
sections
are
section
505(e),
which
in
essence
permits
access
to
other
law;
and
the
505(e)
section
is
written
in
terms
of,
in
essence,
permitting
persons
to
have
access
to
the
law
that
is
out
there,
common
law,
statutory
law,
whatever
law
is
there
from
time
to
time.
and
congress
has
specifically
said
that
litigants
may
have
access
to
the
law
that
is
there,
in
505(e).
however,
congress
did
not
say
in
505(e)
or
in
any
other
portion
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
that
we
are
preserving
and
establishing
the
law
that
exists
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
this
act
as
being
the
rights,
remedies,
and
the
law
available
to
any
litigant
choosing
to
avail
himself,
herself,
or
itself
of
that
particular
body
of
law.
rather,
505(e)
says,
you
shall
have
access
to
the
law
that
may
be
there
as
we
read
it.
then,
there
is
another
section
that
also
deals
with
the
type
of
area
that
we're
looking
at,
were
state
law
involved.
and
it's
one
of
the
areas
of
argument
that
we
have
reached
in
the
various
briefs.
that
is
section
510.
510
does
preserve
something.
it
recognizes
that
the
states
have
sovereign
rights
over
water
pollution
discharges,
etcetera,
within
the
confines
of
the
particular
state.
section
510
preserves
that
right
to
the
states.
to
the
extent
that
the
states
control
discharges
within
their
own
geographical
sovereignty,
where
they
are
dealing
with
something
that
they
have
a
right
to
deal
with,
this
has
been
preserved
by
the
congressional
act
at
section
510,
and
that
continues
on
with
one
very
important
consideration
that
the
congress
engrafted
on
the
rights
of
the
states,
and
that
is,
the
states
may
not
legislate
a
lesser
control
than
congress
does
under
the
act,
or
that
is
adopted
in
the
regulations
under
the
act,
federally.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
absolutely.
no
question
but
what
the
fact
that
the
various
states
have
sovereignty
in
their
own
geographical
area
and
can
create
both
statutory
and
common
law-related
material.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
argument,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
is
true,
within
a
particular
state.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
in
this
case
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
because
of
the
fact
that
the
discharges
are
being
challenged
by
illinois
across
the
state
lines
and
we're
in
an
interstate
body
of
water.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
yes.
we
are
saying
here
that
the
act,
the
regulations
adopted
under
the
act,
and
the
permits
issued
under
the
act
have
totally
controlled
this
precise
situation.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
again
going
back
to
the
earlier
question
of
the
court,
wisconsin
would
be
able
to
impose--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--right.
again,
that
is
the
impact
of
505
and
510
and
those
are
the
two
sections
that
are
most
commonly
referred
to
in
both
the
briefs
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
in
these
cases.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
no,
sir,
i
would
not
so
suggest.
under
the
enactments
of
congress
one
of
the
things
that
is
prevalent
throughout
the
various
portions
of
the
enactment
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
referred
to
at
some
length
in
our
brief
is
the
question
of
costs,
and
the
relevance
of
cost
to
the
type
of
imposition
that
may
be
imposed
upon
various
discharges
in
various
areas.
congress
has
explicitly
said,
insofar
as
the
regulatory
agency,
the
epa,
is
concerned,
and
the
various
state
agencies
operating
under
the
federal
system,
that
one
of
the
things
they
must
look
at
is
cost
and
look
at
cost
effective
systems
and
see
what
the
relationship
is
between
the
cost
that's
being
expended
to
procure
a
particular
level
of
effluent,
as
against
what
would
be
required
to
reach
a
higher
level
of
effluent.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
i
would
not
question
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
take
it.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
yes.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
but
i
would
challenge
the
results
that
came
out,
whether
it
be
from
the--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
that
is
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--that
is
correct.
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
situation
such
as
that,
at
the
very
least,
if
this
court
were
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction
in
that
type
of
case
and
if
it
were
not
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
statutory
and
regulatory
system
that
is
out
there,
it
should
at
least
refer
to
the
epa
and
the
systems
under
it
and
under
the
statute
to
get
the
facts
found
rather
than
going
to
a
district
court
master.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--that
is
correct.
now,
when
congress
acts
in
a
particular
area
so
as
to
completely
dispose
of
that
area...
all
we're
dealing
with
here
is
point-source
discharges...
all
point-source
discharges
are
covered
by
the
congressional
enactment.
there
are
no
exceptions,
and
they
are
referred
to
the
administrative
agency
for
control;
again,
no
exceptions.
there
isn't
any
place
for
a
court
to
step
in
and
operate.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
it
wouldn't
have
taken
any
particular
expertise
or
difficulty
to
do
so,
but
i
believe
they
have
done
so.
as
soon
as
they
say,
we
are
legislating
as
to
each
and
every
point
source,
it
doesn't
leave
any
room
for
anyone
else
to
operate.
so
that,
in
essence,
it
becomes
superfluous
for
them
to
say,
we
are
legislating
for
each
and
every
point
source,
we
are
covering
every
one,
and
by
the
way,
please
don't
apply
common
law
to
it
under
the
federal
system.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
if
congress
had
definitely
left
some
pollutants
open
and
some
areas
where
it
was
not
legislating,
the
courts
would
have
the
opportunity
to
go
into
that
area.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
saying
certain
discharges
are
not
covered?
all
of
our
discharges
are
covered.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
particular
constituent
of
the
effluent.
if
there
were
some
constituent
not
covered,
but
the
entire
permit
process
covers
them
all,
if
the
epa
wants
to
enter
into
control
of
various
effluents
it
can,
so
it's
repeating--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--in
essence,
yes.
all
are
before
it;
all
can
be
brought
into
the
permit
process.
every
state,
including
the
plaintiff
states
in
this
situation,
could
have
come
into
the
permit
process
and
made
sure
that
various
elements
would
be
covered
if
they
were
interested
in
them.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
not
in
this
particular
instance,
no,
sir.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
because
the
regulatory
agency
under
the
statute
has
dealt
with
that
particular--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
oh,
absolutely.
the
states
could
control
much
more
severely
any
one
of
the
discharges
in
any
one
of
the
areas,
as
long
as
it's
within
the
sovereignty
of
that
state,
within
its
own
political
jurisdiction.
but
the
problem
here
is
that
congress
has
said,
so
far
as
point-source
discharges
are
concerned,
this
is
the
way
they
will
be
handled
and
every
one
of
them
will
be
handled
this
way.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
a
higher
level;
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but,
congress
has
covered
every
one
from
a
federal
standpoint,
it
has
covered
every
one
to
a
particular
level,
regardless
of
state
activity.
and
states
can
raise
the
level
of
the
effluent
above
that.
but
they
cannot
decrease
it.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
it
has
clearly
not
preempted
state
activity
in
these
areas
and
has
expressly
said
that
the
states
do
have
the
right
to
act
in
this
area,
and
that
is
section
510
of
the
act.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
no,
it
doesn't
say
common
law
remedies
shall
survive.
505(e),
i
believe,
is
what
the
justice
is
referring
to,
and
in
that
section
all
it
says
is
that
the
people
shall
have
access
to
the
statutory
and
common
law
that
is
in
existence.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
precisely.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because,
again,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
statute
505(e),
it
said
nothing
will
restrict
the
right
which
it
had
but
it
doesn't
say
that
that
right
is
going
to
remain,
that
is,
that
the
common
law
is
going
to
stay
the
law
or
that
statutory
law
that's
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
is
going
to
stay
in
existence.
all
it
says
is,
we
will
not
restrict
the
right
to
come
into
any
area
of
law.
however,
if
that
area
of
law
disappears,
and
this
court
created
the
area
of
law
we're
talking
about,
because
of
the
absence
of
federal
statutory
and
regulatory
law
at
the
time--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
fillings--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--illinois
contends
that
any
examination
of
the
act,
the
regulations
under
it,
and
the
permits
will
indicate
that
illinois
is
absolutely
wrong.
we
have
absolute
coverage
of
these
particular
discharges.
another
area
that
we
think
is
exceedingly
important
to
this
case
is
the
area
of
proof
and
the
type
of
nuisance
that
was
found
by
the
trial
court
and
sustained
by
the
appellate
court.
and
in
that
area
we
again
point
to
the
decisions
of
this
court:
missouri
v.
illinois,
new
york
v.
new
jersey,
which
had
nuisance
cases
and
looked
at
what
happens
when
you
have
testimony
of
experts
in
opposition
to
testimony
of
experts,
but
the
physical
facts
which
can
be
seen
by
a
layman
are
to
the
contrary.
and
this
court
held
that
physical
facts
control.
we
say
the
same
is
true
here,
in
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
anywhere
of
a
pathogen
actually
being
in
illinois
water.
there
are
fecal
coliform
counts
but
there
are
no
pathogens
shown
to
be
in
illinois
water.
there
have
been
no
outbreaks
of
diseases
shown
over
the
lengthy
period
that
these
discharges
have
been
in
existence.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
there
are
no
findings
to
the
contrary,
no.
there
are
findings
to
the
effect
that
pathogens
can
be
transported
x
times
a
year.
what
that
is
based
on
is
that
there
are
pathogens
in
human
waste.
human
waste
does
get
into
the
rivers
and
into
the
lakes
in
and
around
milwaukee;
that
there
are
currents
that
travel
from
milwaukee
to
illinois;
that
they
are
of
length
and
duration
sufficient
to
carry
a
body
of
water.
we
can
say,
a
body
of
water,
as
distinguished
from
what's
in
the
body
of
water,
particularly
the
non-conservative
type
of--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
it
is
an
argument
that
pathogens
are
not
in
the
lake.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
yes,
we
do.
we
have
not
seen
a
single...
we're
talking
about
the
evidence
in
the
record
here...
we
have
not
seen
evidence
of
a
single
pathogen
in
lake
michigan.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
a
pathogen
is
something
that
could
create
a
disease,
either
a
bacteria
or
a
virus
that
could
create
a
disease
in
a
human
being.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
there
is
evidence
of
treated
sewage
discharges
into
the
lake--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--some
overflows,
your
honor.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
all
that
is
shown
is
that
there
is--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--it
is.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
well,
what
i
said
is
we
didn't
find
a
single
pathogen
in
the
lake,
your
honor,
and
that
the
reason
for
this
is--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--precisely.
and
the
plaintiffs
didn't
hunt
for
them.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
we
can
get
it
to
the
rivers
and
to
the
lake
in
milwaukee.
we
have
none
of
anything
but
speculation
that
gets
them
down
to
illinois.
this
is
the
reason
that
i
say
we
haven't
found
any
in
the
lake,
period,
much
less
in
illinois
water.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
pathogens
being
discharged
into...
being
in
sewage
and
sewage
being
discharged
to
the
rivers
and
some
to
the
lake?
yes,
your
horror.
in
that
context.
but
no
evidence
of
the
pathogen
actually
being
found
either
in
the
water
at
milwaukee
or
in
illinois.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
approximately
25.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
and
incidentally
in
that
context,
milwaukee
draws
its
own
drinking
water
from
intakes
within
a
mile
and
a
half
to
eight
miles
of
the
various
discharges
that
we're
talking
about.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
few
comments
on
that
last
colloquy.
the
comment
here
of
counsel
is
that
there
is
no
regulation
of
pathogens.
this
completely
disregards
epa's
own
affidavit
and
one
of
the
things
that
they
are
directing,
the
effluent
limitations
that
they
impose.
one
of
the
things
they
are
directing
those
effluent
limitations
toward
is
the
elimination
of
pathogens
in
the
procedures
that
reduce
those
effluent
levels.
likewise,
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
reversing
the
level
of
the
required
effluent
standards
imposed
by
the
district
court,
this
was
on
the
basis
of
a
lack
of
proof
of
any
efficacy
to
a
higher
level
of
treatment
related
to
the
type
of
exposure
that
illinois
was
claiming.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
no,
it
was
not
a
preemption
basis.
no,
sir,
your
honor.
we
also
have
counsel
saying
that
there's
no
equivalent
remedy
for
epa
to
a
nuisance
action.
if
they
wanted
to
enforce
a
permit
they'd
have
to
go
to
court.
i
don't
know
where
counsel
figures
that
epa
is
enforcing
nuisance
remedies.
it's
the
same
place.
the
only
difference
is
that
under
the
statute
and
under
the
regulations
the
court
knows
how
to
enforce
and
must
enforce
the
permit
requirements.
as
far
as
the
"superfund"
legislation
is
concerned,
we
were
given
a
copy
of
its
legislative
history
just
before
the
lunch
break
and
told
that
it
would
be
referred
to
by
counsel.
we
have
reviewed
it;
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
that
legislation
that
has
any
bearing
upon
this
case
whatsoever.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
it
has
not
passed.
it
is
just
talk
in
the
congress
at
the
present
time.
it
has
no
validity
whatsoever.
it
is
just
discussion.
so
far
as
the
commentaries
between
senators
muskie,
griffin,
and
hart,
we
have
quoted
the
various
colloquies
between
those
persons
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
said
is
there
was
a
similar
colloquy
with
congressman
wright.
not
only
is
it
similar,
it
is
identical
to
what
senator
muskie
said,
and
it
does
not
include
federal
common
law.
as
to
the
applicability
of
section
511
as
referred
to
by
counsel,
of
course
we
did
not
refer
to
it.
it's
not
applicable
to
this
case.
there
is
no
other
federal
law
that
is
being
relied
upon
by
illinois
or
michigan.
as
to
the
concession
of
preemption
that
counsel
talks
about,
we
grant--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--yes,
sir.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
federal
common
law;
but
this...
511
is
going
to
other
federal
statutes
not
being--
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
going
back
to
the
so-called
concession
of
no
preemption
being
present,
the
court
of
appeals
does
make
that
statement
in
its
decision.
i
have
a
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
with
me.
there
was
no
such
concession.
there
was
a
discussion
and
what
it
evolved
around
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
so-called
common
law
of
the
statutes,
which
is
the
way
judge
tone
dealt
with
it,
and
the
way
i
dealt
with
it
on
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that,
in
essence,
preemption
is
not
the
proper
word
to
be
used
here
in
displacing
federal
common
law
by
federal
statutory
law.
rather,
it
is
the
control
or
common
law
of
the
statute
impacting
on
federal
common
law.
but
judge
tone
carried
that
into
his
decision
as
saying
that
there
was
a
concession
that
there
was
no
preemption.
we
disagree
with
that
construction.
mr.
elwin
j.
zarwell
sorry,
your
honor,
thank
you.
