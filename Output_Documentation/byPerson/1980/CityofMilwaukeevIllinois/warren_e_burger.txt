chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
city
of
milwaukee
v.
illinois
and
michigan.
mr.
zarwell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
he
said
that
might
happen
some
day.
chief
justice
burger
there
you're
reading
justice
douglas'
statement
which
you
quoted
apparently
as
meaning
that
as
soon
as
congress
legislated
in
the
area,
the
general
area,
automatically
that
operated
as
a
preemption?
chief
justice
burger
you
would
not
suggest,
i
take
it,
that
congress
could
preempt
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
an
area
of
this
kind,
would
you?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
pursue
the
point
i
was
just
raising
that
you
responded
to.
suppose
this
court
had
appointed
this
particular
district
judge
as
the
special
master
retaining
original
jurisdiction
and
he
had
conducted
exactly
the
hearings
which
he
had
conducted
here,
and
came
out
with
precisely
what
we
have
now.
i
take
it,
as
a
natural
extension,
you
would
not
question
the
validity
of
that
action?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
might
be
arguing
here
on
the
original
jurisdiction
case,
you
mean?
chief
justice
burger
you
might
be
challenging
his
findings?
chief
justice
burger
the
results,
but
not
the
power?
chief
justice
burger
well,
it
wouldn't
have
taken
congress
very
many
words
to
achieve
the
result
you're
arguing
for,
to
write
into
the
statute
a
clear,
unequivocal
statement,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
karaganis.
chief
justice
burger
--in
other
words,
the
few
words
that
i
suggested
to
your
friend,
had
they
been
uttered,
might
have
taken
state
jurisdiction
away?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
levander.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
zarwell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zarwell,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
79-408,
the
city
of
milwaukee
against
the
states
of
illinois
and
michigan
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
