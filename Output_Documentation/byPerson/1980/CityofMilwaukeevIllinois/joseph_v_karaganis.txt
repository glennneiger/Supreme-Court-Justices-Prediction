mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
listening
to
mr.
zarwell
and
reading
the
briefs
filed
before
this
court,
one
wonders
why
the
state
of
illinois
has
been
doing
what
it's
been
doing
for
the
last
ten
years.
we
were
before
this
court
ten
years
ago
after
this
court
gave
us
two
very
distinct
remedies.
the
first
was
a
recognition
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
ohio
v.
wyandotte
chemicals
that
a
state
has
the
right
to
apply
its
statutory
and
common
law
to
abate
the
tortious
conduct
of
a
nonresident
when
that
conduct
causes
injury
within
the
forum
state.
that
is
ohio
v.
wyandotte
chemical,
which,
i
might
add,
sustained
the
case
law
that
had
been
developing
for
more
than
100
years
dealing
with
what
i
consider
to
be
textbook
or
horn
book
examples
of
this
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
the
status
of
that
case,
your
honor,
is
still
good
law.
we
think
that
was
an
8-1
decision,
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
wanting
to
take
the
case
as
an
original
jurisdiction
case.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
case
has
not
been
overruled
by
this
court.
it's
still
good
law.
more
than
that,
your
honor,
the
ohio
v.
wyandotte
case,
similar
to,
as
we
have
emphasized
several
times,
such
famous
cases
as
the
salton
sea
cases.
they've
stated
it
in
a
hypothetical
example
of
a
man
firing
a
bullet
across
a
state
line,
a
man
irrigating
across
a
state
line,
where
he
dams
up
a
river,
across
in
one
state,
and
then
releases
that
dam
to
the
injury
of
people
in
another
state.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
no,
your
honor.
we
went
back
to
the
district
court
after
this
court
told
us
what
to
do
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee,
and
did
exactly
what
these
two
cases
told
us
to
do
we
filed
a
three-count
complaint,
one
is
based
on
the
federal
common
law
enunciated
by
this
court
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee.
the
second
was
based
on
our
state
statute
which
is
a
long-arm
statute
exactly
designed
to
deal
with
the
situation
of
tortious
conduct
on
coming
across
a
state
line,
as
well
as
our
state
common
law.
it
was
a
three-count
complaint.
the
federal
district
court
in
hearing
the
evidence
which
i'll
get
to,
found
liability
on
all
three
counts.
not
only
federal
common
law,
but
also
state
common
law
and
state
statutes.
i
must
say,
your
honor,
that
the
argument
in
milwaukee
is,
is
that
illinois
v.
milwaukee
preempted
all
state
law,
so
that
when
the
congress
got
around
to
saving
all
state
law,
there
wasn't
any
state
law
to
save.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
except,
your
honor,
that
in
ohio,
as
ohio
v.
wyandotte
points
out--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--except,
your
honor,
that
since
the
salton
sea
cases
there
are
a
variety
of
cases
where
torts
across
state
lines...
the
examples
go
back
into
the
19th
century,
where
torts
across
state
lines,
where,
if
the
injury
occurs
in
the
victimized
state,
that
state
has
authority
to
apply
its
law
and
to
exercise
in
personam
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
no
question.
if
congress
preempts
it
can't
apply
any
state
law.
if
congress
says,
you
shall
not
apply
state
law,
there
is
no
dispute.
congress
can
take--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--yes.
you
look
for
clear
and
unequivocal
intent,
your
honor.
exactly.
clear
and
unequivocal
intent
or
a
direct
conflict,
and
that
conflict--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--your
honor,
when
you
talk
about
occupying
the
field,
there
is
a
misstatement
with
respect
to
the
occupation
of
the
field,
not
only
as
to
the--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
unless
they
explicitly
stated
so.
for
this
reason;
if
you
hold
that
congress
by
regulating
in
this
field
and
saying,
we're
intending
to
cover,
we
intend
to
cover
all
of
the
areas
of
water
pollution;
if
you
hold
that
that
prevents
the
federal
government
or
anybody
else
who
has
standing
to
invoke
federal
common
law,
from
ever
pursuing
federal
common
law,
you
are
then
preventing
primarily
the
federal
government...
because
we
feel
we
still
have
state
remedies...
primarily
the
federal
government
from
ever
dealing
with
a
pollution
situation,
or
indeed,
as
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
its
amicus
brief,
a
variety
of
situations
which
either
congress
could
not
have
foreseen
or
because
the
regulatory
structure
has
not
been
able
to
meet.
now,
we're
not
as
concerned
about
that
because
we
do
feel
that
for
200
years
it
has
been
recognized
that
a
state
may
seek
to
abate
conduct
which
is
causing
injury
inside
the
state.
that's
been
black
letter
law
for
as
long
as
this
court
has
virtually
been
in
existence,
and
it
can
apply
to
state
law.
that's
what
ohio
v.
wyandotte
was
about.
and
indeed,
one
of
the
points
we're
trying
to
make
to
this
court--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
concede
your
point.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
section
505(e)
says,
your
state
common
law
and
state
statutes
shall
be
preserved.
if
congress
had
said,
no
state
law
shall
govern,
we
wouldn't
be
here
under
a
state
law
claim.
we
have
been
following
the
instructions
of
this
court
as
to
what
to
do.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
in
this
and
literally
dozens
of
other
regulatory
areas
where
there
is
currently
a
concurrent
regulatory
body
of
state
statutory
and
common
law.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
it
preserves
what
existed
in
common
law
prior
to
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
might
add,
when
i
say
state
courts...
and
this
is
part
of
the
constitutional
scheme
that
justice
harlan
referred
to
in
ohio
v.
wyandotte,
we
came
here,
just
as
ohio
did,
as
an
original
action.
and
justice
harlan's
analysis
of
the
constitutional
framework
that
existed,
namely,
that
there
are
only
two
forums
where
a
state
with
this
kind
of
grievance
can
be
constitutionally
compelled
to
come,
either
this
court
or,
under
the
constitutional
scheme,
it
was
original
but
not
exclusive
jurisdiction
where
a
state
sued
a
citizen
of
another
state.
mr.
zarwell
made
an
incredibly
telling
point
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
with
respect
to
the
law
applied.
we
think,
your
honor,
that
if
we
were
up
here
on
a
state
claim,
a
state
suing
a
citizen
on
a
state
claim
in
this
court,
this
court
under
erie
v.
tompkins
would
be
bound
to
it
by
an
original
action
state
law.
similarly,
a
federal
district
court
or
a
state
court--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--law
applied,
your
honor,
yes.
on
a
law
applied
basis,
either
the
lower
court,
the
state
court,
or
this
court
would
have
to
apply
erie.
namely,
it
would
have
to
look
to
the
source
of
the
law
being
asserted,
the
source
of
the
substantive
right
being
asserted.
and
the
lower,
court,
if
the
source
of
the
substantive
right
were
based
on
federal
law,
it
would
have
to
apply
federal
law,
as
this
court
would.
if
the
source
of
the
right
were
based
on
state
law,
it
would
have
to
apply
state
law.
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
mr.
zarwell
says...
and
consider
this
situation:
a
private
victim,
a
private
victim
of
a
tort
across-on
the
illinois
line,
suffering
from
the
pollutional
conduct
of
wisconsin
or
illinois,
he
goes
to
sue
and
somebody
says,
no,
you
can't
bring
a
private
action
for
damages.
the
federal
law
has
preempted
not
only
state
law...
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
we're
trying
to
make
here.
we've
got
state
substantive
rights
and
state
remedies.
and
the
only
reason
why
we
went
to
the
federal
district
court
and
pursued
our
federal
common
law
remedy
is
because
this
court
told
us
this
was
the
thing
to
do.
and
when
we
went
back
there,
we
knew
that
several
people
would
say
that
the
outer
limits
of
this
federal
common
law
are
as
yet
uncharted.
so
we
came
in
with
state
law--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--excuse
me,
your
honor,
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
we
go
through
in
detailed
analysis.
there
are
two
lines
of
cases
coming
out
of
erie
v.
tompkins.
there
is
the
so-called--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--well,
okay.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
in
that
case,
that
case
did
not
say.
it
said
that
in
the
interpretation,
as
we
interpret
the
illinois
v.
milwaukee
decision,
it
says
that
in
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
common
law,
federal
law
must
govern
the
interpretation
of
that
federal
common
law.
we
have
no
dispute
with
that
question.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
well,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--we
don't
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
yes.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court,
footnote
6
is
based
on
the
lincoln
mills
decision,
and
we've
gone
back
to
the
lincoln
mills
decision
and
what
lincoln
mills
says
is
that,
as
deitrick
v.
greaney
and
d'oench,
duhme,
and
a
variety
of
other
cases--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--your
honor--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--with
all
due
respect
to
the
court--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--to
you,
justice
white.
with
all
due
respect
to
you,
we
have
read
justice
douglas's
opinion
and
this
court's
opinion
with
great
care.
we
find
that
the
constitutional
basis
that
he
is
asserting,
or
articulating
this
federal
common
law...
now
this
is
between
a
state
and
a
citizen,
now,
not
between
a
state
and
a
state...
is
based
on
an
interstitial...
providing
an
interstitial
remedy
for
the--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--it
was
the
nature
of
the
federal
interest
as
manifested
by
about
ten
statutes.
and
he
chain-cited
about
ten
statutes
and
he
said,
these
are
interstitial
remedies.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
as
a
result
of
that
case
we
were
told
to
go
back
and
make
a
federal
law
claim,
and
as
a
result,
your
honor,
of
ohio
v.
wyandotte,
we
also
inserted
our
state
law
claims.
now
the
irony
and
the
anomaly
that
this
court
faces
is
that
this
court
says,
look,
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee
we
destroyed
state
law.
we
destroyed
the
application
of
state
law--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--in
this
kind
of
case,
which
has
existed
for
200
years.
and
then,
five
months
later,
congress
comes
back
and
says,
well,
look,
we
wanted
to
preserve
any
kinds
of
state
common
law
remedies
that
were
available
and
that
had
long
been
available.
and
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
five
months
later
in
the
'72
water
act
is
a
direct
pickup
from
the
1970
air
act.
and
that
savings
clause,
your
honor,
was
developed
and
dealt
with
law
that
preexisted
prior
to
illinois
v.
milwaukee.
so
what
we're
trying
to
say
here
is
that
there
are
parallel
state
and
federal
substantive
wrongs
and
remedies.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
as
mr.
justice
burger
suggested,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
do
that,
congress
could
have
said
it
did,
because--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--your
honor,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is,
as
this
court
has
suggested
many
times,
if
congress
wants
the
court
to
treat
state
law
as
gone,
all
it
need
do
is
say
so.
and
the
problem
we
have
here--
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
--we
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
if
it
meant
that
it
would
have
said
so,
and
it
meant
preexisting
common
law,
which
included
these
kinds
of
state
law
remedies.
now,
if
i
can,
there's
been
a
number
of
things
that
have
been
said
here
about
the
proofs
in
this
case,
and
what...
the
so-called
conflicts
with
respect
to
the
federal
statutes.
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
this
was
not
a
question
of
experts
coming
in
and
hypothesizing
with
one
another.
the
court
asked
several
times,
are
there
controls
on
the
overflows
under
the
federal
scheme?
the
answer
is,
zero.
no
controls.
what
are
we
talking
about
here?
measured
values
found
by
judge
tone...
found
by
judge
grady
in
the
district
court...
and
what
happened
here,
i
might
add,
is
that...
and
when
we
talk
about
the
two-court
rule
in
a
review
of
the
facts,
that...
judge
grady
entered
findings
of
fact,
judge
tone
and
judge
fairchild,
who
happens
to
come
from
wisconsin,
the
chief
judge
of
the
7th
circuit,
ordered
us
to
file
supplemental
memoranda
where
he
wanted
an
exhaustive,
the
court
wanted
an
exhaustive
review
of
the
facts.
we
did
that.
judge
tone
then
went
through
another
exhaustive
review
of
the
facts
where
he
found,
one,
billions
of
gallons
of
fecally
contaminated
water
coming
from
this
material
into
lake
michigan.
two,
the
court
asked,
are
there
pathogens
going
into
lake
michigan?
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
your
honor,
judge
fairchild
is
still
there.
no,
i
don't
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it,
your
honor.
and
the
fact
is,
is
that
we've
got
billions
of
gallons
going
in,
we've
got
measured
test
data
as
to
what's
going
in.
the
statement
is
made,
well,
maybe
it
comes
down.
we
have
measured
tests
by
milwaukee's
own
witnesses
saying,
of
course
it
comes
down.
the
only
debating
point
is,
how
many
times
a
year
it
comes
down?
the
pollution
coming
out
of
milwaukee
clearly
comes
down.
we
also
have
test
data,
exhaustive
test
data,
showing
that
the
dilution
that's
involved
under
these
circumstances
is
minimal.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
question,
how
did
we
get
into
this
thing
in
the
first
place?
or
you
asked
the
question
about,
what
if
you'd
appointed
a
special
master?
ironically,
this
court
appointed
a
special
master
years
ago,
in
1959,
in
the
case
of
wisconsin
v.
illinois,
and
it
was
judge
maris's
work
in
the
wisconsin
v.
illinois
case
where
wisconsin
said
to
chicago,
dump
your
sewage
into
lake
michigan,
this
is
a
good
place
to
dump
it.
it
was
then
that
we
learned
of
the
consequences
of
low
dilution,
the
consequences
of
long
travel.
virtually
all
of
the
witnesses
below
were
witnesses
that
were
provided
by
either
government
agencies
or
some
of
the
top
universities,
not
based
on
hypothetical
opinions.
mr.
joseph
v.
karaganis
and
down
into
the
mississippi;
exactly.
and
in
that
case
wisconsin
suggested
as
a
remedy
that
we
dump
it
back
into
lake
michigan.
and
the
master
found,
and
this
court
adopted,
i
think,
that
lake
michigan
is
too
fragile
a
body
of
water
to
sustain
this
kind
of
sewage
under
these
kinds
of
circumstances.
and
that's
what...
let's,
if
we
can,
go
to
the
federal
act,
because
this
is
one
of
the
things,
the
misconceptions
that's
involved
here.
the
federal
act
is
not
all-encompassing.
the
federal
act
not
only...
while
preserving
state
remedies,
as
this
court
has
been
dealing
with
at
a
number
of
times...
deals
with
what
they
call
technology-based
effluent
limitations.
when
we
first
were
up
before
this
court
we
had
one
way
to
handle
the
thing.
it
was
very
similar
to
the
air
act.
if
you
wanted
a
certain
water
quality
out
of
a
specialized
body
of
water
like
lake
michigan,
you
said,
let's
have
an
implementation
plan
to
meet
that
quality.
we
were
up
here
because
milwaukee
never
developed
implementation
plans.
we
are
still
at
a
point
where
we're
talking
about
planning
15
years
later.
number
two,
when
the
act
was
passed,
it
said,
we
have
had
enough
with
squabbling
about
implementation
plans.
across
the
board,
uniformly,
we're
going
to
establish
a
minimum
technology-based
limitation,
a
minimum
technology-based
limitation.
the
interpretation
of
that
minimum
technology-based
limitation
by
wisconsin
authorities
is
there
is
no
technology
so
it
will
be
zero.
it's
been
that
way
for
the
last
ten
years.
the
act,
the
house
of
representatives
was
not
satisfied
with
this
technology-based
limitation.
it
said,
look,
that
1965
federal
water
pollution
control
act
gave
us
some
good
remedies.
and
with
respect
to
those
remedies,
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
do
is
say,
look,
if
we've
got
a
lake
tahoe,
or
if
we've
got
a
"queddico",
or
if
we've
got
a
lake
michigan,
or
if
we've
got
some
other
body
of
water,
these
technology
based
limitations
aren't
going
to
be
enough.
i
suggest,
your
honor,
and
the
record
shows,
that
in
the
ten
years
we've
been
around...
under
this
act
eight
years...
wisconsin
has
never
adopted
technology-based
effluent
limitations,
nor
has
it
adopted
water
quality
standards-based
limitations.
and
it's
not
enough
to
say,
well,
illinois
could
have
jumped
in
and
asked
that
these
regulations
be
passed.
i
happen
as
part
of
my
practice
to
represent
sewage
treatment
agencies
like
milwaukee
as
well
as
the
state
of
illinois.
the
fact
is
that
the
regulations
that
would
have
allowed
this
kind
of
process
to
be
developed
under
the
federal
scheme
were
not
even
promulgated
in
tentative
form
until
december
of
1978,
almost
a
year
after
the
judgment
came
down...
i'm
sorry,
several
months
after
the
judgment
came
down.
more
than
that,
your
honor...
and
i
must
emphasize
this...
where
we're
dealing
right
now
is
a
situation
where
it
is
absolutely
essential,
15
years
after
we've
been
into
this
litigation,
with
ample
proof...
ample
proof
on
the
record,
and
the
record's
not
up
before
this
court,
because
the
court
hasn't
asked
for
it
yet,
ample
proof
in
the
record
for
both
the
liability
under
state
law,
the
liability
under
state
statute,
and
the
liability
under
federal
common
law.
we
suggest
that
there
must
be
an
effective
remedy
that
says,
thou
shalt
stop
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
thirteen
years
is
what
the
judge
gave
them,
because
they
said
that's
what
they
needed:
thirteen
years
to
do
a
cleanup.
but
in
order
to
finish
that
thirteen-year
job,
you've
got
to
get
started
now.
in
terms
of
cost
effectiveness,
let
me
suggest
that
the
way
the
statute
talks
about
cost
effectiveness
after
you
deal
with
technology-based,
they
said,
if
you
think
keeping
a
clean
lake
clean
costs
too
much,
don't
call
it
clean
anymore,
call
it
dirty.
it's
called
downgrading.
and
we
cite
the
specific
section
of
the
federal
regulations
that
deal
with
it.
we
have
a
very
precious
lake
there.
it
serves
a
lot
of
people
for
very
valuable
purposes.
we
don't
think
we
should
call
that
lake
dirty.
neither
did
the
federal
district
judge,
neither
did
the
7th
circuit.
we
think
that
this
court
should
affirm,
with
respect
to
the
collection
remedy,
it
should
affirm
consistent
with
ohio
v.
wyandotte,
consistent
with
illinois
v.
milwaukee,
with
the
200-year
history
of
the
states'
rights
to
abate
nuisances
which
are
coming
across
their
lines,
to
abate
the
bullet
situation
across
the
state
line,
to
abate
the
floodwater
situation
across
the
state
line,
for
a
citizen
now,
this
is
directly
related
to
erie
v.
tompkins...
for
a
citizen
of
another
state,
should
be
preserved.
we
think,
also,
that
with
respect
to...
and
i
realize
that
it
is
part
of
another
petition
for
certiorari...
that
to
the
extent
that
there
are
fact
questions
involved,
that
the
appellate
courts
are
not
the
place
to
deal
with
those
fact
questions.
and
we
think
that
the
7th
circuit
in
raising,
even
modifying
the
judgment
below,
should
have
dealt
with
that.
thank
you
very
much.
