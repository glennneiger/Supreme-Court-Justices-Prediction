well,
that
isn't
quite
right,
is
it?
unless
the
state
requires
a
different
handling.
justice
stevens
so
congress
has
not
entirely
preempted
the
lawmaking
function
with
respect
to
any
particular
point?
justice
stevens
hasn't
it
also
said
common
law
remedies
shall
survive?
justice
stevens
"nothing
in
this
section
shall
restrict
any
right
which
any
person
may
have
under
any
statute
or
common
law.
"
justice
stevens
now,
if
that
statute
had
not
been
passed
and
if
illinois
had
a
right
under
common
law
without
the
statute,
doesn't
this
say
that
right
survives?
justice
stevens
because
of
the
absence
of
"adequate
federal
statutory
law".
justice
stevens
illinois
contends
the
federal
law
is
still
inadequate
because
it
doesn't
say,
overflows.
justice
stevens
and
why
not
turn
that
argument
around
and
say
that
congress
wanted
to
be
sure
to
preserve
federal
common
law,
knew
how
to
do
it,
but
it
didn't
do
it
quite
that
explicitly
in
505(e)?
justice
stevens
there's
regulation
against
discharging
raw
sewage
into
the
lake,
isn't
there?
justice
stevens
what
is
there
a
standard
about?
justice
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
what
the
court
did
with
respect
to
the
pollution
standards
here
is
inconsistent
with
your
view
of
preemption?
justice
stevens
mr.
zarwell,
can
i
stop
you
on
that
511
point?
justice
stevens
my
understanding
is
they
are
relying
on
another
federal
law
in
the
sense
of
federal
common
law.
justice
stevens
but
your
point
is
that
511
in
terms
relates
only
to
other
federal
statutes?
justice
stevens
i
see.
