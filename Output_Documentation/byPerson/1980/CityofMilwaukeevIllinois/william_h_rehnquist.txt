justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
legislative
function
could
say
that
there
shall
be
neither
federal
common
law
in
this
area,
nor
federal
statutory
law,
but
state
law
shall
govern?
justice
rehnquist
but,
even
though
congress
said,
there
is
no
paramount
federal
interest?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
in
the
cases
involving
the
allocation
of
waters,
it
was
more
or
less
a
question
where
this
court
had
to
derive
some
system
of
law
because
of
its
jurisdiction,
wasn't
it?
that's
the
scope
of
your
original
jurisdiction
cases.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
preemption
analysis
which
would
be
applied
in
deciding
whether
federal
statutory
law
preempted
federal
common
law
is
the
same
kind
of
analysis
as
the
court
has
applied
in
other
situations
not
dealing
with
water,
as
to
whether
a
congressional
statute
preempted
a
state
statute?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
certainly
would
argue,
if
it
were
to
your
advantage,
i
take
it,
that
the
master
appointed
in
an
original
jurisdiction
case
by
this
court
was
obligated
to
follow
an
act
of
congress
if
that
act
was
applicable,
wouldn't
you?
justice
rehnquist
except
that
they
have
authorized
these
individual
states
within
their
own
boundaries
to
adopt
more
stringent
standards?
justice
rehnquist
was
there
no
expert
testimony
as
to
pathogens
being
discharged
into
the
lake
before
the
district
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
it's
preempted
by
congress?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
apply
the
same
type
of
analysis,
preemption
analysis,
to
congressional
preemption
of
federal
common
law
as
you
do
to
congressional
preemption
of
state
law?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
occupying
the
field?
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
as
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
but
i
mean,
if
one
were
to
conclude
that
congress
in
the
water
act
of
1977
had
occupied
the
field,
so
to
speak,
except
as
to
the
specific
exceptions,
would
that
be
a
preemption?
justice
rehnquist
even
though
it's
not...
even
though
a
state
versus
individual
is
not
a
mandatory
part
of
our
original
jurisdiction?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
his
decision
to
resign
from
the
bench?
justice
rehnquist
well,
wisconsin's
stand
in
the
'59
litigation
was
that
illinois
was
just
draining
lake
michigan
and
dumping
it
all
into
the
chicago
river.
justice
rehnquist
well,
we've
held
in
many
cases,
have
we
not,
that
where
congress
has
occupied
the
field,
even
though
it
has
not
expressly
said
we
intend
to
preempt
state
law,
state
law
is
nonetheless
preempted?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
relying
on
a
quote
from
a
single
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
on
the
floor
of
the
house
in
reference
to
another
report
as
being
a
statement
of
the
will
of
congress?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
hasn't
passed,
has
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nine
years
ago,
illinois
brought
in
original
action
in
this
court
against
the
city
of
milwaukee.
we
have
claimed
that
its
citizens
were
being
harmed
by
discharge
of
inadequately
treated
sewage
and
the
overflow
of
untreated
sewage
in
the
lake
michigan
from
the
milwaukee
sewer
system.
we
then
decline
to
exercise
our
original
jurisdiction
because
illinois
had
available
--
a
federal
common
law
action
in
a
lower
federal
court.
illinois
then
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
chicago
and
was
granted
relief
on
the
basis
of
that
federal
common
law.
the
relief
was
partially
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
milwaukee
was
required
to
take
steps
to
control
of
sewers
overflows
over
and
above
the
steps
required
in
permits
which
should
been
issued
under
the
regulatory
regime
of
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
we
then
granted
the
petition
of
the
city
of
milwaukee
to
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
when
this
case
was
first
before
us
nine
years
ago
and
we
recognize
the
existence
of
a
federal
common
law
action,
we
also
recognize
that
the
time
might
come
when
federal
statutes
would
displace
this
federal
common
law
remedy.
today,
we
hope
that
this
time
has
come.
five
months
after
our
1972
decision,
congress
substantially
revised
the
federal
water
pollution
control
laws.
under
the
new
system,
a
permit
is
required
for
every
so-called
point
source
discharge.
the
permit
subjects
the
discharges
to
the
supervision
of
an
expert
administrative
agency,
either
the
federal
environmental
protection
agency
or
a
state
agency
which
has
been
approved
by
the
federal
agency.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
therefore
wrong
when
they
granted
illinois
relief
premise
on
federal
common
law
after
congress
have
enacted
the
detailed
new
system.
federal
common
law
is
invoked
by
federal
courts
only
as
a
necessary
expedient
to
resolve
questions
demanding
federal
answers
which
have
not
been
addressed
by
congress.
when
congress
has
spoken
to
an
issue,
the
need
for
this
sort
of
law
making
by
the
federal
courts
disappear.
here,
milwaukee
was
operating
a
sewer
system
under
permits
issued
by
the
state
department
of
natural
resources
which
had
been
approved
by
the
federal
epa.
its
discharges
were
being
regulated
under
the
regime
established
by
congress
in
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
a
system
whereby
each
federal
district
court
establishes
its
own
regulatory
regime
under
the
guides
of
federal
common
law
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
legislation
enacted
in
1972.
under
the
present
system,
substantive
decisions
about
how
water
pollution
has
to
be
controlled
are
the
responsibility
of
congress
and
the
administrative
agencies
to
which
congress
is
entrusted
this
responsibility.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
blackmun
with
whom
justice
marshall
and
justice
stevens
joined
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
