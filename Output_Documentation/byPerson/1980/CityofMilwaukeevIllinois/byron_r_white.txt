justice
white
so
that
if
all
of
this
had
taken
place
in
one
state,
say,
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
wisconsin
could
have
required
higher
standards
either
by
statute
or
by
the
law
of
nuisance?
justice
white
but
your
argument's
going
to
be,
i
take
it,
that
resort
may
not
be
had
to
federal
common
law?
justice
white
well,
no;
no,
i
mean,
in
this
case,
particular
case?
justice
white
that's
what
i
mean.
in
this
case...
well,
i
said,
federal
common
law.
and
you're
going
to
say
that
the
court
has
no
business
imposing
higher
standards?
justice
white
so
that
there
may
not
be
a
resort
to
a
body
of
federal
law
that
would
have
been
available
had
the
act
not
been
passed?
justice
white
i
understand
that.
that
isn't
involved
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
suppose
congress
in
legislating
as
to
every
point
source,
however,
had
said,
"except
with
respect
to
certain
pollutants?
"
that's
not
legislating
with
respect
to
them.
justice
white
so,
if
in
this
case
there
are
some
discharges
that
are
not
forbidden
by
the
statute
or
by
regulations,
may...
certainly
the
state
proscribed
them,
but
how
about
federal
common
law?
justice
white
are
you
arguing
that
the
epa
has
not
only
decided
that
certain
discharges
are
to
be
forbidden,
but
no
others
are
to
be
forbidden?
justice
white
well,
is
any
federal
regulation
or
statute
or
permit
being
violated
when
there
is
an
overflow
during
a
storm?
justice
white
well,
why
may
not
a
court
insist
that
those
overflows
be
stopped?
justice
white
well,
you're
saying
they've
in
a
sense
decided
that
no
one
else
should
stop
the
overflows
either?
justice
white
are
there
any
findings
to
the
contrary
below?
justice
white
well,
this
isn't
an
argument
that
these
discharges
are
not
being
made
into
the
lake?
justice
white
it's
just
that
you
claim
there's
no
proof
that
they
were
carried
into
illinois?
justice
white
yes,
but
you
don't
deny
that
pathogens
were
discharged
into
the
lake?
justice
white
what
is
a
pathogen?
justice
white
well,
is
there
evidence
of
sewage
discharges
into
the
lake?
justice
white
how
about
untreated
sewage?
justice
white
well,
some
overflow.
now,
let's
talk
about
that.
you
say
that
that
is
not
evidence
of
pathogens
being
discharged
into
the
lake?
justice
white
well,
is
it
evidence?
justice
white
well,
then,
don't
say
there
isn't
evidence
of
it.
justice
white
it
seems
to
me
you
didn't
hunt
for
them.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
there's
evidence
that
raw
sewage
was
discharged
into
the
lake.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
status
of
that
case
is
now?
justice
white
well,
we're
going
to
get
to
your
second
remedy.
justice
white
so
is
your...
what
is
your
suggestion
going
to
be?
that
this
is
not
a
federal
question?
justice
white
in
a
case
like
this.
justice
white
it
saved,
certainly
saved
state
law
within
its
own
boundaries.
justice
white
i
was
under
the
impression
that
when
you
were
here
before
that
the
court
when
it
remanded
said
that
the
application
of
federal
law
in
this
case
was
required.
justice
white
i'm
just
asking
you
about
one
case.
justice
white
in
one--
justice
white
--well,
the
case
expressly
said
that
the
application
of
federal
law
was
required
in
this
kind
of
case.
justice
white
didn't
it
or
not?
justice
white
if
i
can
find
it,
could
i
read
it
to
you?
is
it--
justice
white
--well,
footnote
6
said,
"thus
we
are
required
to
apply
federal
law
in
this
case.
"
justice
white
well,
you
may
think
it
was
based
on
lincoln
mills,
but
the
text
of
it
came
out
of
interstate
waters.
justice
white
that
footnote
was
to
text
that
was
discussed
if
interstate
waters
cases.
justice
white
not
to
the
court,
to
me.
justice
white
he
said
it
was
not
only
because
of
the
nature
of
the
parties
in
this
case.
justice
white
but
you're
suggesting
to
us
now
that
as
a
result
of
that
case
you
were
told
to
go
back
and
make
a
state
law
claim?
justice
white
in
this
kind
of
case.
justice
white
well
i'm
asking
you
to.
--no,
no,
i'm
asking
whether
what
the
court
below
did
in
reversing
the
district
court's
permission,
or
imposition
of
higher
treatment
standards?
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
reverse
that
district
court
in
some
respects.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
is
inconsistent
with
your
position
in--
justice
white
--and
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
saying
that...
i
suppose
they're
saying
that
the
proof
of
nuisance
had
simply
failed.
justice
white
well,
they
discovered
there
wasn't
any
violation.
justice
white
no,
there...
there
wasn't
any
nuisance.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
there
had
been
a
lot
of
pathogens
found
in
illinois
waters
or
where
there
was
effluent
being
dumped
into
the
lake,
but
that
the
only
place
that
came
from
was
from
treated
sewage.
just
suppose
that.
now,
i
don't...
i
wouldn't
think--
justice
white
--was
full
of
pathogens,
but
otherwise
it
absolutely
complied
with
the
permit.
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
imposing,
higher
standards
on
treated
sewage.
justice
white
you
mean,
even
though
it
was
full
of
pathogens?
justice
white
it
wasn't
because
they
thought
there
was
any
preemption?
