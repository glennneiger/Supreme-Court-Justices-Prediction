justice
jr.
if
it
applied.
if
it
applied
under
a
statutory
law
standard
and
not
any
common
law
standard,
that
would
govern
both
the
special
master
and
this
court,
wouldn't
it?
justice
jr.
but
doesn't
it
get
down
to
a
question
of
congressional
intent?
when
congress
enacted
the
statute,
did
it
mean
that
the
statutory
standards,
whatever
they
be,
should
displace
any
federal
common
law
standard?
justice
jr.
and
if
they
can't
say
that
the
statute
is
to
be
read
that
way,
then
i
gather
that
the
common
law
standards
are
not
displaced?
justice
jr.
i
gather
this
argument
is,
no
matter
how
explicit
congress
may
have
been
in
the
statute
and
said,
no
state
law,
no
common
law,
nothing
but
this
shall
govern,
you
still
say
you'd
be
able
to--
justice
jr.
and
you
say
that
this
exception
preserves
state
jurisdiction
even
as
to
discharges
into
interstate
waters?
justice
jr.
all
right.
and...
well,
your
argument
is
that
it
permits
the
state
courts
to
adjudicate
claims
based
on
discharges
into
interstate
waters?
justice
jr.
isn't
it
possible
that
that
exception
should
be
read
as
limited
to
discharges
within
the
four
corners
of
the
state
itself?
state
law
applies
there,
but
not
to
a
situation
like
this?
justice
jr.
there
is
no
question
congress
in
this
whole
displacement
or
preemption
or
whatever
you
call
it,
never
gives
us
the
help
it
ought
to
give
us.
justice
jr.
no,
but
my
question
to
you
is,
whether
or
not
the
exception
may
not
be
read
as
limited
to
discharges
within
the
four
corners
of
the
state?
