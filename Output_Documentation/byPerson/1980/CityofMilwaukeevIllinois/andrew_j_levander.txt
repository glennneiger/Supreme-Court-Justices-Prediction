mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
issue
in
this
case,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
is
whether
the
clean
water
act
preempts
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
that
this
court
recognized
and
applied
in
this
very
case
eight
years
ago.
and
that
question,
as
i'll
point
out
in
a
moment,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
said,
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
now,
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
petitioners
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
conceded
that
the
clean
water
act
does
not
preempt
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
and
i
would
point
your
honors'
attention
respectfully
to
page
a7
of
that
act,
where
the
court
of
appeals
notes
this
concession.
in
any
event,
that
concession
is
well
warranted,
in
the
government's
view.
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out,
it
is
very
simple
for
congress
to
put
into
an
act
an
intent
to
preempt
and
it
did
so
in
section
312(f)
with
regard
to
a
very
select
kind
of
regulations.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
state
law?
that
is
correct.
but
when
one
does
that,
that
is
a
reflection
of
the
court's
finding
that
the
application
of
state
law
would
interfere
with
congressional
design
and
therefore
it
must
have
been
congress's
intent
to
preempt.
now,
in
this
case,
we
have
several
provisions
of
the
statute
which
reflect
quite
an
opposite
intent
in
our
view.
first,
as
was
mentioned
before,
we
have
section
505(e),
which
specifically
says
that
people
who
have
rights
under
the
common
law
and
other
statutes
still
have
those
rights.
second,
we
have
section
510
which
says
that
the
states
may
impose
stricter
requirements.
now,
petitioners
in
their
argument
suggested
that
the
statute
clearly
was
the
end-all-and-be-all
for
federal
law,
but
they
neglect
to
mention
section
511.
section
511
of
the
act
says
that
other
federal
law
may
impose
higher
requirements,
and
that
nothing
in
the
act
is
intended
to
restrict
or
limit
those
other
federal
bodies
of
law.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
and
focused
on
federal
common
law
of
nuisance,
and
that
it
intended
to
preserve
the
rights
and
remedies
under
that
body
of
law.
first,
there
is
general
language
in
both
the
reports
emphasizing
that
the
section
505(e)
makes
clear
that
compliance
with
the
act
is
not
a
defense
to
nuisance
actions
or
other
kinds
of
actions.
second,
there's
a
colloquy
in
the
senate
between
senators
muskie,
griffin,
and
hart,
senator
muskie
being
the
primary
sponsor
of
the
act,
in
which
senator
griffin
inquires
about
the
effect
of
this
act
on
then-pending
litigation
in
the
so-called
reserve
mining
suit
which
was
brought
by
epa
and
which
had
three
bases,
one
of
which
was,
as
senator
griffin
noted,
a
public
nuisance
claim;
and
if
you
go
to
the
decision,
they
say
the
only
public
nuisance
claim
is
a
federal
common
law
nuisance
claim.
senator
muskie
replies
that,
generally,
that
the
act
will
not
affect
that
suit.
and
moments
later,
senator
hart
says,
based
on
my
understanding
of
what
my
brother
has
just
said,
from
maine,
this
act,
passage
of
this
act
will
not
affect
the
counts
of
the
reserve
mining
suit
under
the
refuse
act,
under
the
old
pollution
control
act,
and
of
other
law,
that
is,
the
common
law.
so,
another
piece
of
legislative
history
which
is
not
explored
fully
in
the
briefs
occurs
in
a
house
debate
in
which
representative
dingell,
who
is
a
sponsor
of
the
act
in
the
house,
refers
with
approval,
and
quotes
from
a
report
issued
before
the
enactment
of
the
clean
water
act,
but
which
was
not
issued
in
conjunction
with
the
clean
water
act.
this
is
hr
92-1401.
that
report
urges
as
one
of
its
conclusions
in
analyzing
problems
of
oil
discharges
that
the
coast
guard
fully
and
vigorously
employs
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance...
federal
common
law...
i
mean,
there's
no
equivocation...
to
remedy
oil
spills.
and
it
specifically
discusses
this
court's
decision
in
illinois
v.
milwaukee,
the
reserve
mining
case,
and
another
case
called
ira
s.
bushey,
all
of
which
were
federal
common
law
nuisance
suits,
and
discusses
them
approvingly
and
in
detail.
and
that's
on
pages
6
and
32
and
33
of
that
report.
so,
insofar
as
the
question
of
correction
is
a
matter
of
congressional
intent,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
we
have
to
guess.
congress
focused,
and
it
said
what
it
intended
to
do,
that
is,
to
let
people
preserve
their
rights
under
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
first
of
all,
we
have
the
sponsor
in
the
senate
and
senator
hart
in
particular
who
focused
on
the
federal
common
law
nuisance
claim
and
said
that
the
act
would
not
affect
it.
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
a
fairly
focused
discussion.
second,
we
have
the
statement
in
the
senate
report
accompanying
the
act
which
says
that
compliance
with
the
act
will
not
be
a
defense
to
other
kinds
of
actions.
and
third,
we
have
congressman
dingell
who
is
a
sponsor
of
the
act
in
the
house
referring
and
quoting
from
this
report
on
the
floor
of
the
house.
it's
just
not
likely
that
congress
was
therefore,
as
petitioners
initially
suggest
in
their
briefs,
completely
unaware
of
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance.
to
the
contrary,
they...
at
least
some
committees
of
congress,
and
the
report
suggests
that
they
were
aware
of
this
remedy.
now,
the
section
505(e),
the
savings
clause,
is
part
of
a
pattern
of
congressional
enactment,
i
might
point
out.
in
numerous
other
acts
concerning
the
environment,
a
similar
savings
clause
appears
and
this,
in
our
view,
is
indicative
of
continuing
congressional
intent
to
preserve
these
common
law
remedies.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
legislation
which
is
now
pending
in
congress
and
which
may
be
enacted
very
shortly
and
of
which
the
court
should
be
aware,
and
that
is
the
so-called
s.
1480.
now,
section
107(i)
and
(j)
of
that
bill,
which
is
now
pending
before
the
house,
specifically
states
that
the
remedies
under
the
act
shall...
and
i'm
quoting
now...
shall
not
"affect
or
modify
in
any
way
the
obligations
or
liability
of
any
person
under
any
other
provision
of
state
or
federal
law,
including
common
law.
"
so,
i
think
that
it
is,
this
is
indicative
of
congress's
continuing
intent--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
but,
it
referred
to
the
common
law,
and
may
be
they're
just
getting
better
at
preserving
it
and
making
it
absolutely
clear.
now,
in
the
last
couple
minutes
i
wish
to
address,
if
i
might,
the
claims
that
there
are
lots
of
adequate
remedies
for
illinois
under
the
federal
act,
and
that
therefore
the
doctrines
of
primary
jurisdiction
and
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
are
applicable
here.
i
would
point
out,
first
of
all,
that
there
is
no
remedy
equivalent
to
a
nuisance
remedy
that
is
decided
or
applied
by
epa.
in
fact,
when
epa
thinks
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
or
a
permit,
it
must
go
to
district
court
to
litigate
that
matter.
therefore,
there
is
no
agency
expertise
with
regard
to
the
particular
violation,
a
particular
situation
or
the
fact
that
fecal
coliform
and
pathogens
are
moving
down
a
particular
body
of
water.
when
epa
regulates,
of
course,
it's
regulating
on
a
nationwide
basis.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
the
issue
in
the
instant
suit,
presence
of
these
pathogens,
is
not
something
that
epa
has
regulated
about.
there
is
no
epa
regulation
regarding
pathogen.
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
all
the
remedies
that
are
pointed
out
at
pages
34
and
35
of
petitioners'
brief
consist
and
require--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--there
is
a
regulation
requiring
that
all
discharges
be
covered
by
a
permit,
but
there
is
no
specific
standard
such
as
there
is
for,
let's
say,
what
they
call
biological
oxygen
demands.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
biological
oxygen
demand,
ph,
and
some
other
things
which
are
quantifiable
and
they
are
regulated
by
epa's
regulations.
that
is,
30-30
rule,
they
call
it.
but
there
is
no
such
regulation
regarding
pathogens.
now,
all
the
remedies
that
are
suggested
at
pages
34
and
35
of
petitioners'
brief
involve
only
asking,
hat
in
hand,
either
wisconsin
or
epa
to
do
something
about
this
situation.
there
is
no
way
for
them
to
enforce
their
own
standards
or
protect,
necessarily,
their
waters.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
we
have
not
taken
any
position
on
the
remedy
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
we
think
that
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
footnote
5
of
the
illinois
v.
milwaukee
decision,
that
although
the
federal
statute
and
regulations
do
not
mark
the
outer
bounds
of
federal
common
law,
they
are
certainly
guidelines.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
now,
using
federal
standards
as
guidelines,
where
there
were
such
federal
standards--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--no,
i
don't
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
or
that
the
remedy
was
inappropriate
to
curb
that
particular
kind
of
nuisance,
that
equity
in
applying
nuisance
law--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
i
think
equity
says
that
you
should
tailor
the
remedy
to
a
particular
kind
of
nuisance.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
think
they
found
that
there
was
a
nuisance
insofar
as
pathogens
were
being
dumped
into
large
amounts
of...
a
large
number
of
pathogens
were
being
dumped
into
lake
michigan
and
entering
illinois
waters.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
the
treated
sewage
was--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--i
would
say
in
that
case
that
if
there
was
a
showing
that
there
was
a
health
risk
to
illinois
inhabitants
that
the
federal
common
law
of
nuisance
would
allow
the
judge
to
impose--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
i
think
that
the
court--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
because
it
didn't
believe
that
the
extra
limitations
that
were
imposed
by
the
district
court
were
necessary
to
protect
the
health
of
illinois
inhabitants,
i
take
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
but
that
those
limits
were
sufficient
to
protect
illinois.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
