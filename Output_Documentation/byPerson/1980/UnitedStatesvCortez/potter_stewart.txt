it
is
not
contended
in
this
case,
is
it,
mrs.

that

stop
was,
the
locus
of
this

was
the
border
or
its
equivalent?

terry
v.
ohio
was--
justice
stewart
--a
decision
that
limited...
that
is
justification
for
a
frisk
for
a
weapon
or
a
gun,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
that's
not
this
case?
justice
stewart
brignoni-ponce
is
the
case?
justice
stewart
well
that's
the
standard
of
rule
52(a),
that's
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
stewart
two
questions,
mr.
minker.
you
began
by
talking
about
the
person
with
the
burden
of
persuasion,
the
burden
of
proof,
the
person
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
who
do
you
think
that
is?
justice
stewart
well
yes,
he
has
to
first
say
that,
and
that
gives
him--
justice
stewart
--a
burden,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
generally,
when
the
government
seeks
to
introduce
evidence,
or
proposes
to
introduce
evidence,
according
to
whether
it's
a
motion
to
suppress
or
objection
to
the
introduction
evidence,
the
person
who
makes
the
motion
to
suppress
or
the
person
who
objects
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
has
the
burden,
doesn't
he?
justice
stewart
not
the
government,
not
the
prosecution?
justice
stewart
well
he
has
to
do
more
than
just
say
that,
doesn't
he?
justice
stewart
first
of
all,
that
the
search
or
the
seizure
was
without
a
warrant,
doesn't
he?
justice
stewart
without
probable
cause,
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
without
founded
suspicion.
and
that's
my
second
question,
isn't
that
a
phrase
that's
peculiar
to
their,
or
at
least,
was
born
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it's
not
a
phrase
to
be
found
in
an
opinion
of
our
court,
is
it?
