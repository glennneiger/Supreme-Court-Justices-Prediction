justice
rehnquist
mrs.
etkind,
this
is
a
fairly
remote
and
deserted
part
of
arizona,
is
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
etkind?
justice
rehnquist
here
the
court
of
appeals
majority
reversed
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
do
you
think
that
the
question
of
founded
suspicion
as
the
brignoni-ponce
test
has
come
to
be
called,
is
a
question
of
law,
a
question
of
fact,
or
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact?
justice
rehnquist
well
you
can
only
slice
a
cheese
so
thin,
from
probable
cause
to
founded
suspicion
to
reasonable
suspicion.
in
the
end,
you
end
up
with
phrases
that
really
merge
into
one
another,
do
you
not?
and
that's
why
i
asked,
whether
you
are
asking
for
different
test
or
not,
there
only
can
be
so
many
tests
and
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
one
would
think
that
reasonable
suspicion
and
founded
suspicion
would
probably
be
the
same
thing.
justice
rehnquist
actually,
in
martinez-fuerte,
the
term
is
that
rational
inferences
from
those
facts
that
reasonably
warrant
suspicion,
is
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
and
again,
if
you
want
to
make
fine
points
about
distinctions,
you
consider
that
slightly
different
than
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
about
the
situation
you
have
here
where
you
have
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
dissenting
member
is
from
arizona
and
the
district
court
has
found,
presumably
on
the
eyewitness
testimony
before
him
that
there
is
articulable
suspicion.
isn't
the
panel
required
to
give
some
weight
to
the
testimony...
or
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court?
justice
rehnquist
and
there's
also
a
rule
that
if
a
defendant
on
trial
for
a
particular
offense
wishes
to
suppress
evidence,
the
burden
is
on
the
person
moving
to
suppress,
is
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there's
been
no
warrant
and
the
government
is
operating
on
a
theory
that
there
was
founded
suspicion
or
whatever
one
wants
to
call
it,
the
defendant
claims
there
is
none.
now,
when
that
evidence
is
tendered
into
evidence,
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
object
and
to
make
clear
the
objection,
is
it
not?
it's
not
up
to
the
government
to
show
why
it
should
go
in
evidence.
justice
rehnquist
well
did
the
defendant
object
in
the
trial
court
on
fourth
amendment
grounds?
justice
rehnquist
well
certainly,
going
from
arizona
to
california
or
california
to
arizona,
both
states
stop
trucks
and
cars
as
well.
that's
for
the
fruit.
justice
rehnquist
but
in
ybarra
nobody
was
on
the
move,
the
people
were
simply
standing
around
the
bar.
this
is
a
case
of
crossing
a
state
line.
justice
rehnquist
what
deference
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
to
give
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
rehnquist
well
isn't
there
a
presumption
that
when
denies
a
motion
it
makes
every
finding
that
is
necessary
for
the
denial
of
that
motion?
justice
rehnquist
well
mr.
minker,
i
have
some
trouble
with
the
printed
appendix
here,
in
that,
it
seems
to
be
solely
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress.
was
there
ever
any
trial
beyond
that,
or
was
this
simply
an
appeal
of
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
suppress?
justice
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
verdict
in
the
hernandez
case?
justice
rehnquist
and
how
about--
justice
rehnquist
--i
said
hernandez.
justice
rehnquist
interstate
86,
it's
way
south...
it's
south
of
i-10,
very
close
to
the
mexican
border.
justice
rehnquist
but
no
one
would
take
86
from
phoenix
to
tucson,
they'd
take
i-10.
justice
rehnquist
well
but--
--at
night?
at
night?
justice
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
how
many
innocent
travelers
were
interfered
with
in
the
course
of
this
search?
justice
rehnquist
so
they
stopped
only
this
vehicle,
in
other
words?
justice
rehnquist
so,
what
your
complaint
is,
they
should
have
stopped
more
vehicles,
not
less?
