mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
that
centers
upon
whether
a
vehicle
may
be
seized
simply
because
it
travels
on
an
east-west
highway
and
returns
to
the
direction
from
which
it
came.
the
government
suggests
to
the
court
that
the
totality
of
circumstances
is
that
this
behavior
or
this
exhibited
conduct
is
sufficient
to
lead
to
the
rational
conclusion
that
a
crime
or
criminal
activity
was
taking
place.
the
supreme
court,
in
dealing
with
reasonable
suspicion
cases,
has
adopted
the
term
reasonable
suspicion.
the
ninth
circuit,
after
the
brignoni-ponce
decision
came
out
and
several
other
cases,
stated
that
they
had
been
using
the
founded
suspicion
test
or
doctrine,
but
that
in
fact
was
equivalent--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
founded
suspicion?
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
it's
the
same
thing.
the
manner
in
which
any
seizure
by
a
police
officer
is
evaluated,
is
done
by
the
court,
because
the
court
has
a
very
important
function
in
these
types
of
cases.
the
court
clearly
has
the
obligation
to
view
the
matter
through...
in
light
of
the
officer's
experience.
however,
the
reasonable
suspicion
test
requires
specificity
and
objectivity.
if
the
court
must
look
at
the
evidence
and
must
analyze
it
objectively
to
determine
whether
the
officer's
experience
and
observations
are
reasonable.
if
the
court
is
not
to
look
at
this
objectively
and
specifically,
then
what
you
have
simply
is
the
court
accepting
any
rationale
by
any
police
officer,
which
then
would
eliminate
the
court's
function
in
fourth
amendment
cases
and
would
in
fact
preclude
any
assertion
that
the
officer's
conduct
is
unreasonable.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
in
this
case
the
district
court
made
no
finding;
the
court
simply
heard
the
evidence.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
record
carefully,
it's
clear
from
the
testimony
of
agent
gray
and
agent
rayburn
that
in
cross-examination,
when
questions
were
asked
of
them
about
the
area,
they
really
weren't
that
familiar
with
the
area.
they
didn't
know
how
many
people
really
lived
in
sells,
they
didn't
know
that
sells
was
the
capital.
it's
our
position
that
the
trial
judge
and
the
court
appellate
judge
really
cannot
take
judicial
notice
of
things
that
this
is
a
remote
area.
arizona
is
not
any
different
than
california,
nevada
and
texas.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
generally,...
the
court
can
do
that.
the
ruling
usually
provide
that
judicial
notice
is
to
be
taken
of
something
that
the
court
will
notify
counsel
so
they
have
an
opportunity
to
question
or
to
present
evidence
on
that
issue.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
yes,
that's
correct.
and
the
problem
is
that
when
the...
all
the
defendant
needs
to
do
is
show
a
prima
facie...
some
showing
that
the
search
is
unreasonable,
where
there
is
no
warrant
and
clearly
there
has
been
no
warrant
obtained
in
this
case.
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
it's
clearly
established
that
the
government
had
to
go
forward
with
proof
to
justify
the
seizure.
and
i
don't
think
it's
apparent--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--yes,
yes.
but
there's
nothing,
as
i
see
it,
in
this
case,
there's
nothing
which
the
government
has
produced
that
suggests
that
the
criminal
activity
that
they
believe
is
occurring
is
in
any
way
connected
to
the
defendant.
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
this
route,
that
this
area
of
suspicion
by
these
two
agents
is
used
less
frequently
than
any
other
place
on
the
border.
so,
an
objective
evaluation
of
this
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
doesn't
advance
the
nexus
or
connection
to
believe
that
the
crime,
if
it's
being
committed,
is
rationally
connected
to
the
defendant.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
yes,
your
honor.
so
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case,
is
the
court
has
various
decisions
regarding
this
problem.
the
court
has
said
that
you
simply
can't
stop
the
vehicle
or
a
person,
you
can't
stop
the
vehicle
because
it's
on
the
highway,
you
can't
stop
a
mexican
simply
because
he's
in
a
vehicle,
you
need
something
more.
the
court--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--i
don't
believe
so.
if
the
state
were
to
pass
a
law
like
that,
the
court
would
strike
that
down
as
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
the
court
has
taken
the
position
that
those
types
of
intrusions
are
made
as
a
regulatory
matter
that
the
public
has
the
ability
to
know
that
if
they
are
driving
these
types
of
vehicles
that
there
will
be
these
checkpoints.
every
person
driving
these
vehicles
is
subject
to
seizure,
every
person
knows
that
a
certain
seizure
will
take
place.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
but
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
rational
basis
for
that,
and
there's
no
notice
to
the
public--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--i
don't
believe
so.
a
vehicle,
simply
because
a
presence
in
an
area,
would
not
justify
a
seizure.
there
would
have
to
be
some
basis
for
a
seizure,
otherwise
everything
is
subject
to
seizure,
whether
or
not
there's
a
reason
to
believe
that
there's
any
criminal
activity--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--the
court
hasn't--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--i'm
not
aware
of
whether
every
state
does
it--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--the
state
does
not
do
that.
that's
the
federal
government
that
stops--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--for
purposes
of
inspecting
fruit.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
yes,
but
the
court
has...
has
two
ways
of
looking
at
this.
the
seizure
is
whether
there's
specific
and
objective
facts
justifying
the
seizure
of
a
particular
individual,
and
then
the
court
has
also
suggested,
or
certain
areas
where
discretion
of
the
officers
is
limited,
where
the
policy
decisions
for
stopping
vehicles
has
been
made
by
persons
higher
in
the
government,
the
discretion
of
the
officer
in
the
field
is
limited
so
that
he
may
not
make...
stops
at
night
simply
because
he
has
a
belief
that
criminal
activity
is
occurring
and
has
a
belief
that
that
criminal
activity
is
connected
to
the
vehicle.
this
court
has
already
rendered
decisions
where
simply
being
in
an
area
is
insufficient
to
justify
seizure.
certainly,
a
proposition
can
be
made
that
in
ybarra
v.
illinois,
that
simply
being
in
bar
where
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
bar
has
narcotics,
that
person
is
not
subject
to
seizure.
he's
there.
in
sibron,
the
court
said
merely
talking
to
drug
addicts
is
insufficient
to
justify
seizure.
so,--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--in
this
case,
let
me
make
an
even
closer
case
then,
that
would
be...
in
this
case
there's
no
crossing
a
state
line.
a
similar
example
would
be,
as
in
brown
v.
texas,
where
an
individual
was
coming
out
of
an
area
of
high
incidence
where
he
had
been
seen
with
another
person
and
that
isn't
sufficient.
what
we
have
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
the
vehicle
in
the
area,
no
reason
to
believe
from
looking
at
the
vehicle
that
it's
been
in
the
area.
we
have
a
vehicle,
we
can't
stop
it
because
it's
a
vehicle...
you
can't
stop
it
if
all
you've
got
is
the
vehicle
in
the
area.
the
government
now
suggests
that
if
the
vehicle
is
suspected
without
more
of
going
into
the
area,
it's
not
enough.
and
that
clearly
can't
be
the
test,
because
then
the
next
thing
that
happens
is,
any
vehicle
driving
north
can
be
seized,
any
vehicle...
just,
on
the
record
here,
really,
there
is
no
basis
to
rationally
conclude
that
the
seizure
was
justified.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
your
honor,
without
more,
and
that's
all.
that
might
be--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--it
might
be--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--well,
it's
not
reasonable
to
seize
the
person,
but
it
might
be
a
basis
for
focusing
suspicion.
clearly,
if
you
look
at
something
and
you
say
well
that's
strange,
then
the
court
considers
well,
officers
are
entitled
to
look
at
things
and
decide
if
they
are
strange.
the
question
then
becomes
is
there
a
need
for
immediate
action,
is
there
something
beyond
their
suspicion.
and
you
look
at
the
vehicle
and
if
it's
going
to
have
20
people
in
it,
that
should
have
an
effect
on
the
vehicle.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
well
certainly--
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
--certainly
they
could
have
done
that,
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
that
they
could
have
done
something
to
watch
the
vehicle
and
determine
whether
it
really
required
any
further
action.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
there
were
six
in
this
camper,
they
expected
8
to
20,
at
least.
so,
we
submit
that
based
on
prior
law,
this
really...
the
stop
is
infamous;
what
the
government
really
seeks
to
do,
is
to
say
that
they
can...
make
any
hypothesis
or
any
deduction
of
criminal
activity
that
that
places
them
under
reasonable
suspicion.
and
clearly
it
does
not,
that
cannot
be
correct,
if
you
try
to
evaluate
the
evidence
and
the
totality
of
circumstances,
there
comes
a
point
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
reid,
where
simply
looking
at
officers
suspicions,
the
court
has
to
say
it's
not
reasonable
or
it's
not
reasonable,
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
has
adopted
the
clearly
erroneous
test,
where
the
court,
the
lower
court
makes
findings.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
but
that's
the
standard.
and
the
deference...
we
have
an
effect
of
an
open
record
here,
the
court
simply
denied
the
motion,
granted
counsel
an
exception.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
that
may
be
the
case.
but
even
as...
even
with
the
record,
at
the
best
that
the
government
states
it,
there
isn't
enough
to
objectively
say
that
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
and
a
particularized
suspicion
that
this
vehicle
was
engaged
in
that
suspicion.
there's
no
nexus
justifying
a
seizure.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
well
that's,
in
a
hindsight
evaluation,
that's...
it's
not
possible.
mr.
bernardo
p.
velasco
well
of
course.
but
if
this
seizure
had
resulted
in
the
seizure
of
some
other
group
of
aliens,
the
court
would
look
at
this
and
say
they've
had
this
hypothesis
designed
to
catch
mr.
cortez
and
mr.
hernandez,
however,
it
resulted
in
the
apprehension
of
some
totally
unrelated
group,
it
would
make
it
sound
less
reasonable.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
has
to
do
in
this
case;
to
look
at...
do
they
have
about
criminal
activity.
they
merely
had
a
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
took
place,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
nexus.
