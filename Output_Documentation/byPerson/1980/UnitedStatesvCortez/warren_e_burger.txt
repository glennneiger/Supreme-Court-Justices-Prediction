chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
united
states
against
cortez.
and
mrs.
etkind,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
have
we
not
said
in
some
opinions,
in
common
with
a
good
many
courts
of
appeals,
that
in
making
this
evaluation
we
are
not
to
do
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
judge
sitting
in
a
library,
but
from...
as
seen
through
the
eyes
and
understanding
of
the
trained
law
enforcement
officer,
words
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
velasco.
chief
justice
burger
are
you
saying...
are
you
telling
us
that
they
may
not
take
judicial
notice
of
the
geography
of
the
area?
chief
justice
burger
couldn't
the
government,
by
statute
or
regulation,
or
the
bureau,
declare
that
any
vehicle
over
5
tons,
4
tons,
within
25
miles
of
the
border
or
15
miles
of
the
border,
should
be
stopped
and
searched?
chief
justice
burger
well
how
do
the
states
then
get
by,
to
use
the
vernacular,
with
having
these
pull-off
areas
and
requiring
every
truck
over
a
certain
tonnage
to
stop
to
be
checked
and
weighed?
chief
justice
burger
well
that's
my
hypothesis,
that
every
truck,
every
vehicle
over
x-tons,
let's
make
it
2
tons,
may
be
stopped.
chief
justice
burger
no,
no.
now
you're
linking
this
case
up
with
my
hypothetical
and
i'm
just
asking
you
an
abstract,
hypothetical
question.
could
it
constitutionally
be
ordered
that
every
truck
over
that
given,
every
vehicle
over
that
size,
be
stopped?
chief
justice
burger
well
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
regulation
could
have
been
met
by
following
that
vehicle
to
its
destination
and
watch
the
illegal
aliens
disgorge
from
the
camper?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
the
way
to
do
it?
chief
justice
burger
how
many
illegal
aliens
were
in
the
camper?
chief
justice
burger
can
you
point
out
which
of
the
suppositions
that
the
officers
were
making
in
reaching
their
total
conclusion,
proved
to
be
untrue?
the
round
trip,
for
example,
that
mr.
justice
stevens
referred
to,
and
all
the
other
facts?
chief
justice
burger
well
of
course,
it
is
hindsight
now.
the
judges,
the
business
of
judges
is
necessarily
hindsight.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
minker.
chief
justice
burger
was
it
not
a
series
of
hunches,
rather
than
one?
chief
justice
burger
now
when,
take
that
episode
now,
down
and
back
in
90
minutes,
do
you
say
that
the
inferences
which
the
officers
drew
from
that
and
all
the
other
circumstances,
was
reasonable
or
was
it
irrational,
or
totally
unfounded?
chief
justice
burger
well
maybe
your
way
would
be
better
and
maybe
they
should
do
it
your
way,
but
we
have
to
deal
with
it
the
way
it
is
here.
but
do
you
say
it
was...
the
inferences
they
drew
from
this
round
trip
in
90
minutes
were
unfounded?
chief
justice
burger
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
said
added
to
all
the
other
factors.
chief
justice
burger
and
you
say
that's
not...
that's
irrational?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
minker.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mrs.
etkind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

disposition
to
announce
in

states
against

and

with
the
