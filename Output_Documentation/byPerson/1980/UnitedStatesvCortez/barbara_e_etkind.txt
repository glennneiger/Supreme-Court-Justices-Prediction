ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
single
question
presented
is
whether
border
patrol
officers
have
founded
suspicion
to
stop
the
camper
in
which
respondents
were
traveling
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
january
31st,
1977.
respondents
were
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
arizona
on
six
counts
of
knowingly
transporting
illegal
aliens,
in
violation
of
8
u.s.c.
1324(a)(2).
both
respondents
moved
to
suppress
the
fruits
of
the
search
of
the
camper
in
which
they
were
apprehended,
on
the
ground
that
the
initial
stop
of
the
vehicle
was
not
supported
by
founded
suspicion.
the
evidence
derived
from
the
stop
included
the
illegal
aliens
themselves,
their
testimony,
a
flashlight,
and
the
physical
evidence
of
a
chevron
design
on
the
soles
of
the
shoes
worn
by
respondent,
hernandez-loera.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress,
and
both
respondents
were
found
guilty
on
all
counts.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
border
patrol
officers
did
not
have
founded
suspicion
to
stop
respondents'
camper.
in
our
view,
the
stop
at
issue
was
the
culmination
of
brilliant
detective
work
on
the
part
of
the
border
patrol
officers.
in
holding
that
the
fruits
of
that
stop
should
have
been
suppressed,
the
court
of
appeals
departed
egregiously
from
this
court's
holding
that
an
articulable
founded
suspicion
justifies
the
minimal
intrusion
upon
the
right
to
travel,
that
is
occasioned
by
a
roving
border
patrol
stop
of
a
vehicle.
because
the
question
of
whether
founded
suspicion
exists
is
a
fact-bound
one,
i
shall
begin
by
describing
the
facts
of
this
case
in
some
detail.
for
some
months
prior
to
the
stop
at
issue,
border
patrol
officers
had
been
investigating
groups
of
footprints
leading
from
the
mexican
border
north
to
route
86,
an
east-west
highway
running
generally
parallel
to
the
mexican
border
and
at
a
distance
of
between
25
and
50
miles
from
it.
the
footprints
followed
roughly
the
same
27-mile
path,
through
a
sparsely
populated
desert
area
known
to
be
heavily
used
by
aliens
illegally
entering
the
country.
the
tracks
would
reach
route
86,
around
mile
post
119,
and
then
continue
eastward
for
three
miles,
to
mile
post
122,
where
they
disappeared.
the
groups
contained
between
7
and
18
pairs
of
footprints,
and
in
each
group
there
recurred
the
shoeprint
of
a
distinctive
chevron
design.
that
is
the
front
part
of
the
sole
containing
8
forward-pointing
v's
and
the
back,
the
heel,
contained
4
backward-pointing
v's.
the
chevron
design
appeared
to
be
the
lead
print
in
each
group,
and
border
patrol
officers
in
the
area
concluded
that
a
person,
whom
they
called
the
chevron,
was
guiding
groups
of
aliens
across
the
mexican
border
and
north
to
a
pick-up
point
on
route
86.
in
fact,
a
group
of
illegal
aliens
that
were
previously
apprehended
had
identified
respondent
hernandez-loera
as
the
wearer
of
the
chevron-soled
shoes
and
as
the
man
who
was
to
guide
them
to
meet
a
smuggler
off
route
86.
border
patrol
officer
wayne
gray,
who
participated
in
the
stop
of
respondents'
camper
on
january
31st,
himself
had
tracked
the
footprints
from
mile
post
119
to
mile
post
122
on
january
4th,
and
all
the
way
from
the
mexican
border
to
mile
post
122,
on
january
16th.
from
the
physical
attributes
of
the
footprints,
the
officers
were
able
to
make
several
deductions.
they
concluded
that
chevron
traveled
on
or
near
weekends,
that
he
and
the
aliens
he
led
walked
in
darkness,
from
shortly
after
beginning
their
journey;
that
it
took
them
from
8
to
12
hours
to
reach
the
highway,
and
that
they
were
met
there
by
a
camper,
van,
or
similar
vehicle
that
could
hold
a
large
number
of
people
without
arousing
suspicion.
the
officers
also
knew
that
overland
border
crossings
generally
are
made
in
good
weather.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes,
it
is,
sir.
finally--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes.
from
the
fact
that
the
footprints
once
they
reached
the
highway,
continued
eastward
along
the
highway,
the
officers
concluded
that
the
aliens'
ultimate
destination
was
somewhere
east
of
the
pick-up
point,
and
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes,
yes.
and
they
also
considered
that
the
pick-up
vehicle
would
be
approaching
the
area
from
the
east
as
well.
based
on
these
facts
and--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
based
on
the--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i'm
sorry,
8
to
12
hours
that
they
were
walking
in
the
dark.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well
it
was
an
approximately,
27-mile
journey,
and
the
officers,
from
their
previous
experience,
estimated
that
forced
marches
of
this
type
take
two
and
a
half
to
three
miles
per
hour,
so
from
that,
they
came
to
8--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--also
on
their
experience,
yes,
but
on
the
fact
that
the
footprints
indicated
a
forced
march,
there
weren't
stops,
no
evidence
of
snacking
along
the
way
or
taking
breaks.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
based
on
these
facts
and
inferences
officer
gray
and
his
partner,
ronald
evans,
made
the
following
arrangements
in
an
attempt
to
capture
the
chevron.
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
monday,
january
31st,
which
was
the
first
clear
night
after
three
days
of
rain,
the
officers
stationed
themselves
at
milepost
149,
on
route
86,
27
miles
east
of
the
anticipated
pick-up
point.
because
they
expected
the
departure
by
chevron
and
his
group,
at
or
shortly
after
nightfall
which
occurred
around
6
p.m.,
and
an
8
to
12-hour
journey
by
them,
the
officers
watched
for
a
camper,
van,
or
similar
vehicle
that
would
pass
them
heading
westward
and
then
return
past
them
heading
eastward
around
one
and
a
half
hours
later.
the
round
trip
to
be
made,
approximately
between
the
hours
of
2
and
6
a.m.--
the
officers
began
their
surveillance
at
1
a.m.
and
at
4:30,
a
greenish-yellow
pick-up
truck
with
a
camper
shell
and
a
license
plate
number
beginning
gn-88
passed
the
officers
heading
westward.
at
6:12
a.m.
a
vehicle
of
the
same
description
passed
the
officers
heading
east.
after
verifying
that
the
camper's
license
plate
number
was
gn-8804,
the
officers
stopped
the
vehicle
and
in
it
they
found
the
respondents
and
six
illegal
aliens.
the
soles
of
the
shoes
respondent
hernandez-loera
was
wearing
bore
the
distinctive
chevron
design.
the
court
of
appeals
appeared
to
accept
the
facts
i
have
outlined,
but
nonetheless
held
that
they
did
not
establish
founded
suspicion
to
stop
respondents'
camper.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
suspicious
fact
connected
with
the
camper
was
its
passing
the
officers
heading
west
and
returning
past
them
heading
east
in
the
pre-dawn
hours.
that
fact,
the
court
held,
was
consistent
with
too
many
innocent
explanations
to
make
the
officers'
suspicions
reasonably
warranted.
in
the
first
place,
a
possible
innocent
explanation
does
not
preclude
the
existence
of
founded
suspicion.
after
all,
if
an
innocent
explanation
were
less
likely
than
a
guilty
one
there
would
be
probable
cause.
but
more
important
for
the
purpose
of
the
present
case,
in
holding
as
it
did,
the
court
of
appeals
completely
ignored
all
of
the
clues
and
inferences
that
were
available
to
the
officers
from
their
extensive
investigation
of
previous
illegal
border
crossings
led
by
respondent
hernandez-loera.
there
is
nothing
in
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
supports
the
distinctions
drawn
by
the
court
of
appeals
between,
on
the
one
hand
suspicious
characteristics
of
an
individual
or
vehicle
directly
observable
at
the
time
of
apprehension
and
on
the
other
hand,
physical
clues
left
by
a
suspect
at
the
scene
of
his
prior
offenses,
indicative
of
a
very
specific
modus
operandi.
beginning
with
terry
v.
ohio,
this
court
has
established
that
where
the
founded
suspicion
justifying
an
investigative
stop
exists
depends
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
of
which
an
officer
is
cognizant.
indeed,
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise.
because
almost
any
characteristic
of
a
vehicle
or
person
that
in
isolation
may
seem
entirely
innocent,
when
viewed
together
with
other
circumstances
may
be
quite
indicative
of
criminal
activity
and
the
converse
is
also
true.
in
adams
v.
williams,
this
court
upheld
an
investigatory
stop
based
on
a
tip
from
an
informant
who
had
provided
information
in
the
past.
this
case
made
clear
that
information
need
be
of
no
particular
type
in
order
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
founded
suspicion.
as
the
court
stated
"informant's
tip,
like
all
other
clues
and
evidence
coming
to
a
policeman
on
the
scene,
vary
greatly
in
their
value
and
reliability.
"
"one
simple
rule
will
not
cover
every
situation.
"
"in
united
states
v.
brignoni-ponce,
in
which
this
court
applied
the
founded
suspicion
test
to
investigatory
stops
by
roving
border
patrols
makes
clear
that
it
is
the
totality
of
circumstances
that
controls
in
this
context
as
well.
"
or
if
the
founded
suspicion
test
were
to
require
that
some
aspect
of
a
vehicle
or
its
occupants
in
and
of
itself
warrants
suspicion,
the
following
factors
listed
by
the
court
in
brignoni-ponce
would
be
irrelevant
or
superfluous,
in
this
case,
the
court
said
that
officers
may
consider
the
characteristics
of
the
area
in
which
they
encounter
a
vehicle,
its
proximity
to
the
border,
the
usual
patterns
of
traffic
on
the
particular
road,
and
previous
experience
with
alien
traffic
are
all
relevant.
they
also
may
consider
information
about
recent
illegal
border
crossings
in
the
area.
all
of
these
factors
were
present
in
this
case.
the
country
involved
was
sparsely
populated
desert
terrain,
the
mexican
border
was
located
approximately
25
miles
from
the
pick-up
point
and
50
miles
from
the
point
of
apprehension.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
border
or
its,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no,
it
is
not
contended.
only
about
15
to
20
cars
had
traveled
west
and
only
about
6
to
10
cars
had
traveled
east,
past
the
officers,
during
their
entire
five-hour
surveillance
period.
both
officers
had
worked
in
the
area
as
border
patrol
officers
for
2
to
3
years.
and
more
significantly,
not
only
were
they
aware
of
the
high
degree
of
alien
smuggling
in
the
area
in
general,
but
they
were
also
specifically
aware
of
recent
smuggling
expeditions
led
by
the
very
person
for
whom
they
were
watching.
in
brignoni-ponce
the
court
also
listed
factors
concerning
the
driver's
behavior
and
the
appearance
of
the
vehicle
and
its
occupants.
such
factors
are
present
here
as
well.
as
the
court
suggested,
the
type
of
vehicle
employed;
in
this
case,
the
camper
is
significant.
moreover,
the
fact
that
the
camper
was
making
an
early
morning
one
and
a
half
hour
round
trip
on
a
lightly
traveled
road
in
an
area
known
for
alien
smuggling,
is,
we
submit,
itself
grounds
for
founded
suspicion.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well
i
think
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
founded
suspicion
exists
is
a
question
of
law.
but
the
question
is
not
whether
all--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
think--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
think
the
words
in
brignoni-ponce
may
be
reasonable
suspicion.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
oh--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
idea
of
specific
and
articulable
factors
that
lead
the
officer
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--that's
true.
and--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no,
that's
not
this
case.
in
brignoni-ponce...
the
court
found
that
the
justification
there
for
allowing--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes,
it
is.
in
any
event,
the--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--the
brignoni-ponce
test--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
that's
right.
i'm
not
asking
for
a
different--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--oh,
i
certainly
am
not,
and
in
fact,
the
case
certainly
would
not
require
that.
in
our
view,
this
case
presents
probable
cause,
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
the
court
may
not
reach
that
decision.
but
certainly
you
don't
need
to
slice
anything--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--it
is
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
and
i
do
think
it
is
the
same
as
the
reasonable
suspicion
that
was
referred
to
in
terry
v.
ohio.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
in
any
event,
the
question
is
not
whether
all
of
the
factors
listed
in
brignoni-ponce
are
present,
but
whether
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
gives
rise
to
founded
suspicion.
in
that
connection,
this
court
emphasized
that
any
number
of
factors
may
be
taken
into
account,
but
each
case
must
turn
on
the
totality
of
its
particular
circumstances
and
that
in
all
situations
the
officer
is
entitled
to
assess
the
facts
in
light
of
his
experience
in
detecting
illegal
entry
and
smuggling.
brignoni-ponce
controls
the
present
case
and
it
requires
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
occurred
in
the
present
case
is
detective
work
of
the
highest
caliber
which
should
be
encouraged
and
not
disparaged
by
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
here
denigrated
the
officers'
actions
in
this
case
as
being
based
solely
on
a
profile.
while
we
certainly
do
not
eschew
the
use
of
profiles
in
appropriate
circumstances...
no
profile,
as
that
term
is
commonly
used,
was
employed
by
the
officers
in
this
case.
a
profile
is
a
set
of
typical
characteristics
of
a
certain
type
of
criminal,
such
as
an
airplane
hi-jacker
or
a
drug
courier,
that
is
developed
by
law
enforcement
agents
on
the
basis
of
their
pooled
experience
with
large
numbers
of
criminals
of
a
particular
sort.
in
contrast,
in
the
present
case,
border
patrol
officers
discerned
the
modus
operandi
of
their
particular
suspect,
the
chevron,
not
from
their
prior
general
experience
of
alien
smuggling,
in
large
part,
but
from
the
physical
clues
left
at
the
scene
of
respondent
hernandez-loera's
previous
journey.
to
find
clues
and
deduce
them
in
identifying
features
of
the
culprit
is
the
essence
of
good
detective
work.
while
there
may
be
a
question
of
semantics,
but
certainly
none
of
substance,
as
to
whether
the
identification
of
a
suspect's
individualized
modus
operandi
may
constitute
a
profile,
there
is
no
question
but
that
such
a
profile
represents
precisely
the
kind
of
rational
assessment
of
the
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
that
the
fourth
amendment
demands.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
suggestion,
it
is
exactly
this
type
of
reasoned
investigative
work
that
diminishes
the
number
of
police
intrusions
based
on
unarticulated
hunches
or
random
guesswork.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
quantity
of
evidence
necessary
to
establish
founded
suspicion,
we
submit
that
the
present
case
is
at
the
far
end
of
the
continuum
from
what
was
present
in
brignoni-ponce.
in
that
case,
in
which
this
court
suppressed
the
fruits
of
the
stop,
the
only
basis
for
the
stop
was
the
occupant's
apparent
mexican
ancestry.
here
on
the
other
hand,
the
officers
had
all
the
clues
and
inferences
arising
from
them
that
i
have
described,
which
were
corroborated
when
respondents'
camper
passed
the
officers
heading
west
and
then
backtracked
past
them,
heading
east,
during
the
early
morning
hours
of
january
31st.
as
i
stated,
in
our
view
these
facts
provided
not
only
founded
suspicion
but
probable
cause
as
well.
of
course
this
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause,
but
for
the
guidance
of
the
lower
federal
courts
and
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
field,
we
submit
that
the
facts
possessed
by
the
officers
in
this
case
are
far
above
the
minimum
necessary
to
justify
an
investigatory
stop
of
the
vehicle.
unless
there
are
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
a
couple
of
points,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
with
respect
to
the
interference
to
innocent
travelers,
just
to
clarify
it
the
only
vehicle
that
was
stopped
during
that
entire
five-hour
surveillance
period
was
the
respondents'
camper.
in
response
to
the
point
of
why
the
officers
didn't
station
themselves
at
milepost
122,
as
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
the
officers
were
responsible
for
surveilling
also
the
altheim
valley,
which
is
at
the
crossroads
of
highway
86
and
286,
and
that's
where
milepost
149
is
located.
that's
why
they
were
at
149,
so
that
they
could
watch
for
both
things.
and
finally,
in
any
event,
the
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
test
of
reasonableness
and
it
is
not
a
test
of
the
least
restrictive
alternative
that
mr.
minker
would
suggest
the
officers
should
have
followed.
