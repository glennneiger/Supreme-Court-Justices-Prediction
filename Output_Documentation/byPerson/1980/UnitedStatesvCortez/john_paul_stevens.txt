justice
stevens
but
how
could
they
tell
from
the
footprints
that
it
took
6
to
8
hours
and
that
they
walked
in
the
dark?
justice
stevens
oh,
8
to
12,
that's
right.
justice
stevens
so
that
really
wasn't
just
based
on
the
footprints,
it's
based
on
their
experiences?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
mrs.
etkind,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
founded
suspicion?
what's
the
source
of
that
phrase,
founded
suspicion;
is
that
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinions
or
is
that
in
any
opinion
of
this
court?
is
it
used
in
brignoni-ponce?
justice
stevens
and
if
so,
where?
justice
stevens
that's
the
way
i
read
it,
too.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it's
a
different
test
than
the
test
of
terry
against
ohio?
justice
stevens
but
your,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
founded
suspicion
test
is
the
same
as
the
terry
test?
justice
stevens
because
that's
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
stevens
you're
not
asking
us
to
slice
the
cheese
any
more
thinly
than--
justice
stevens
mr.
velasco,
we
have
a
round
trip
here.
justice
stevens
it's
fairly
significant
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
in
a
deserted
area,
unless,
i
mean,
you
did
suggest
maybe
they
were
picking
up
astronomers
or
something
like
that,
but
at
this
hour
of
the
night
it's
not
totally
without
reason
to
assume
it
has
some
connection,
is
it?
justice
stevens
well
and
if
it
makes
a
round
trip
too,
which
not
many
did.
but
mr.
minker,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
procedure
in
the
ninth
circuit?
how
often
do
the
trial
judges
make
findings
of
fact
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
which
he
did
not
do
here,
at
least,
didn't
spell
them
out.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
but
he
sits
in
tucson
every
winter,
doesn't
he?
