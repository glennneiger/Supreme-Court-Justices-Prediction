mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
cases
of
founded
suspicion
or
probable
cause,
the
party
having
the
burden
of
proof
is
permitted
to
use
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence
or
any
combination
thereof.
this
has
always
been
the
law
in
founded
suspicion
cases,
it's
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
the
case
to
look
at
for
an
example
is
a
case
cited
by
the
government
which
is
the
united
states
v.
clark.
clark,
the
facts
there,
are
interesting
when
you
compare
them
to
our
case.
there
were
four
relevant
facts
in
clark:
one,
there
was
the
proximity
to
the
border,
one
mile;
two,
the
agent
received
a
radio
call
that
aliens
were
coming
over
the
border;
three,
there
were
no
other
vehicles
in
the
area
where
the
aliens
were
coming
over
the
border,
and
four,
the
defendant
was
seen
leaving
the
border
on
the
only
north-south
road
going
from
the
border.
our
case
does
not
involve
any
new
tests.
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
simply
says
that
the
government
did
not
meet
the
requirement
of
the
founded
suspicion
test.
even
judge
chambers,
in
his
dissent,
does
not
talk
about
a
new
test
or
a
different
test
being
created,
he
quarreled
with
the
analysis
of
the
facts
by
the
majority.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
i
think
basically,
in
the
practical
day-to-day
experience
of
the
district
courts,
the
defendant
who
has
been
seized
without
a
warrant,
simply
comes
forward
and
says
i
have
been
seized
without
a
warrant,
my
constitutional
rights
have--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--yes.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
yes.
that's
what
happens.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
that
is
correct.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
well,
all
you
really
do
is
make
the
motion,
the
prosecution,
as
happened
in
this
case,
the
transcript
clearly
shows
the
government
proceeds
on
to
make
its
case,
the
government
started
its
case,
the
government
called
its
witnesses
agent
rayburn
and
agent
gray
and
the
other
agent
and
this
is
what
happens
in
all
of
these
cases.
so
once
the
defendant
raises
the
issue
in
the
district
court
and
says
there
has
been
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--well,
he
files
a
memorandum
pointing
out
why
he
feels--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--yes.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
no,
i
believe
it
was
born
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
they
are
using
that
phrase
the
same
as
reasonable
suspicion.
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
make
any
distinction.
every
day
in
the
district
courts
of
this
country,
cases
are
fought
out
involving
founded
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
no,
there
was
a
trial,
in
the
case
of
mr.
cortez,
there
was...
there
were
two
trials,
the
first
ended
in
a
hung
jury,
and
in
the
second,
there
was
a
conviction.
but
the
cases
were
severed
and
cortez
and
hernandez
had
separate
trials.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
on
the
second
trial
he
was
found
guilty.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
did
you
say
in
hernandez
or
in
cortez?
i'm
sorry--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--he
was
guilty.
when
a
party
loses
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
district
court,
in
most
cases
the
matter
ends
there.
in
a
few
cases,
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
there
was
in
this
case,
to
the
ninth
circuit.
when
the
decision
is
reached
in
the
ninth
circuit,
that
is
usually
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
in
this
case,
the
justice
department
has
come
here,
and
has
said,
we
want
a
reversal.
and
reading
their
brief,
they
really,
i
submit,
do
not
want
a
reversal
simply
based
on
an
argument
of
the
facts;
they
want
a
new
test
to
create
it.
they
want
another
slice
of
the
pie.
they,
no
matter
how
ornately
you
christen
their
new
test,
it
will
be
known
in
the
inelegant
vernacular
as
the
hunch
test,
and
a
hunch
will
give
an
agent
the
right
to
make
a
stop
based
on
a
gut
feeling
or
a
hunch.
hunches
do
play
a
very
proper
role
in
police
work.
the
second
circuit
talks
about
that
in
a
case
called
price,
where
they
said
a
hunch
tells
an
agent
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
what's
going
to
happen,
but
it
does
not
give
the
basis
to
make
a
seizure.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
hunch
that
led
to
a
seizure
and--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--well,
if
you
call
their
profile
one
hunch
and
there's
no
question
that
the
agent
said
i
had
a
profile
here,
and
he
says
it
at
page
78
and
79
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
is
questioned,
and
he
says
i
have
a
profile,
the
profile
is
based
on
the
fact
that
any
car,
virtually
any
car
but
a
sedan...
and
excluding
linen
trucks,
for
some
reason
commercial
vans,
that's
capable
of
carrying
8
to
20
aliens
fits
my
profile.
and
we
are
going
to
stop
and
search
every
one
of
those
vehicles
that
met
that
profile
provided
they
went
and
returned
within
an
approximate
time
of
an
hour
and
a
half.
well,
when--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
well
i
said
south--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--highway
86.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
it
is
highway
86,
and
to--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--well,
in
our
opposition
we
attached
a
map.
the
map
clearly
shows
where
the
interstate
is,
and
it
clearly
shows
where
highway
86
is.
it
shows
where
the
agents
were,
at
a
place
called
three
points.
it
indicates
where
sells,
arizona,
the
capital
of
the
papago
nation
is,
it
also
indicates
where
kitt
peak
national
observatory,
probably
the
most
famous,
one
of
the
most
famous
world
observatories
in
the
world
is.
and
it
shows
all
these
things
they're
on
a
highway
it
is
approximately
25-30
miles
north
of
the
border
and
it
goes
east-west
and
the
highway
does
not
itself
directly
go
to
the
border.
the
highway,
eventually,
as
the
map
shows,
goes
to
tucson,
or
up
to
phoenix.
you
can
take,
go
to
either
city;
you
have
metropolitan
cities,
of
a
half
million,
which
is
tucson,
or
phoenix,
which
is
a
million,
and
you're
talking
about
an
hour's
distance
or
so.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
well,
i
respectfully
disagree.
there
are
plenty
of
areas
in
arizona
that
i
personally
have
traveled
where
i
do
not
take
the
interstate;
where
i
will
take
sideroads
simply
because
they
are
much
more
scenic.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
only
if
i'm
hoping
for
a
very
pretty
daybreak.
well,
the
agents
know
they
are
on
an
east-west
road
30
miles
or
so
from
the
border.
they
also
know
exactly
where
the
aliens
cross
the
border
and
come
into
the
united
states
and
they
know
exactly
where
they
go.
they
know
that
the
aliens
come
in
near
an
indian
village
called
itek
and
they
go
directly
to
milepost
122.
now
knowing
that,
the
agents
have
certain
things
that
they
should
have
done.
they,
if
they
are
going
to
eliminate
an
interference
to
innocent
travelers,
they
have
a
duty
to
minimize
things.
there
is
talk
in
the
transcript
about
sensors.
well,
a
sensor
could
have
been
placed
at
itek
and
the
agents
would
then
know
that
an
alien
is
coming,
that
there
are
hits
on
the
sensor,
a
number
of
hits,
you
know
a
number
of
people
have
just
crossed
the
border.
you
also
put
a
sensor
at
milepost
122,
the
agents
talked
about
a
culvert.
well,
you
put
another
sensor
there.
now
you
have
something.
but
more
important
than
all
of
this,
you
go
to
milepost
122.
if
the
agents
are
so
sure,
even
though
there's
been
no
activity
for
two
weeks,
they
have
not
looked
for
a
track
in
two
weeks,
they
haven't
heard
of
any
alien
smuggling
in
two
weeks,
they
have
not
had
a
tip
from
an
informant
in
two
weeks
about
aliens
coming
over.
and
when
you
compare
that
with
clark
that
we
talked
about
before,
in
clark
you
have
a
tip,
in
clark
you
have
an
area
one
mile
from
the
border.
you
have
a
car
seen
going
from
that
area.
we
don't
know
where
this
car
went;
the
agents
are
27
miles
away,
the
car
goes
by
them
and
comes
back
and
that
is
the
key
factor.
these
are
trained
agents,
they
could
see
a
license
number.
well
i
submit
to
you,
if
they
can
see
a
license
number,
these
trained
agents
who
are
expecting
a
vehicle
to
pick
up
8
to
20
aliens...
8
to
20
aliens
is
1500
to
3000
pounds;
a
simple
pick-up,
camper,
if
it
goes
by
and
they
can
see
the
license
number
and
if
it
comes
back
and
they
can
again
see
a
license
number,
they
are
pretty
close
to
that
vehicle.
it
is
going
to
be
riding
significantly
lower.
and
there
are
a
myriad
of
cases
saying...
where
you
take
other
things
into
account,
the
lowness
of
the
vehicle
is
important.
well
if
these
agents
had
seen
the
vehicle
riding
low,
that
would
have
indicated
to
them
that
there
would
have
been
an
added
weight
in
the
hour
and
a
half
that
they
had
seen
it.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
well--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--well
i
assume
that--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--that
can
be
done.
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
riding
low
is
indicative,
gives
a
basis
for
a
stop.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
it
was
not
sufficient
for
the
following
three
reasons.
you
have
kitt
peak,
you
have
sells,
arizona,
six
miles
down
the
road,
the
capital
of
the
indian
nation,
and
finally,
you
have
houses,
one
miles
down
the
road
from
milepost
122.
the
transcript
shows
that
there
are
houses
on
highway
86
around
milepost
121.
when
you
have
all
that
kind
of
activity,
the
agents
have
a
duty
to
go
down,
close
to
mile-post
122,
get
there
earlier
in
the
morning--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--those
inferences
do
not,
in
and
by
themselves,
do
not
equal
a
founded
suspicion.
they
are
a
hunch,
and
they
say
to
the
officer...
go
do
more.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
do
not
equal
a
founded
suspicion.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
i
say
that
is
not
founded
suspicion.
i
do
not
say
the
agents
acted
irrationally;
they
had,
done
certain
no
question
there
was
some
good
police
work
done
here,
but
as
the
court
said
in
price,
they
had
a
good
hunch,
but
they
have
to
do
more
than
a
hunch
and
at
the
same
time,
they
have
to
minimize
the
intrusion
on
travelers
of
the
road.
and
to
set
yourself
up
25
miles
down
the
road,
well,
next
time
it
could
be
50
miles
or
it
could
be
5
miles,
there
are
no
limits
here.
i
think
this
court
has
to
say
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
said
it,
in
its
opinion,
if
you
are
going
to
intrude
on
what
may
well
be
innocent
travelers,
then
you
have
to
minimize
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
intruded
upon
and
you
have
to
limit
the
area,
the
scope
of
the
area.
and
in
this
case,
the
scope
of
the
area,
if
the
agents
had
gone
to
milepost
123
and
set
up
their
binoculars
and
watched,
then
there
would
be
no
innocent
travelers
basically,
who
could
be
interfered
with,
because
they
would
be
knowing
the
people
would
be
going
to
milepost
122,
because
they'd
watch
them,
and
then
if
the
aliens
took
off
in
their
truck,
they
could
pull
them
over.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
the
record
shows
that
they
saw
10
to
15
vehicles
go
by
them
in
a
westerly
direction,
five
of
which
basically
meet
their
profile
but
they
didn't
stop
those
five.
the
other
ten,
they
did
not...
apparently
were
sedans.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
the
other
vehicle
that
met
their
profile
had
not
come
back
as
of
the
time
they
stopped
this
vehicle.
it
was
the
second
vehicle
that
went
by
at
10
minutes
to
5,
this
vehicle
went
by
at
4:30,
but
they
also
didn't
stop
or
keep
track
of,
the
three
commercial
vehicles
that
were
certainly
capable
of
holding
8
to
20
aliens
and
their--
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
--i
beg
your
pardon.
that
is
not
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying
that
their
profile
is
so
broad,
virtually
any
vehicle
on
the
highway
can
hold
8
to
20
aliens...
the
agents
so
testified
to
that.
that
would
say
to
them
if
they
have
a
gut
feeling,
any
large
vehicle,
any
camper,
any
motor
home,
any
mobile
home,
any
type
of
vehicle
whatsoever,
can
be
stopped
if
the
agents
have
a
hunch.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
i
personally
have
had
a
relatively
significant
number
of
cases
where
i've
even
had
written
opinions
on
founded
suspicion
or
probable
cause
cases.
it
depends
on
the
judge.
this
is
not
a...
the
judge
in
this
case
is
not
a
district
court
judge
from
arizona,
he's
from
new
york.
mr.
s.
jeffrey
minker
this
winter
he
did
not
choose
to
go
out.
he's
sat
out
there
for
the
last
ten
winters
to
avoid
the
unpleasant
new
york
weather.
