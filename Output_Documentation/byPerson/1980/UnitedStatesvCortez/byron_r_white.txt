justice
white
--of
course,
you
may
have
been
only
paying
some
deference
to
the
language
that
this
court
has
used?
but
my
point
was,
this
court
didn't
use
the
language
you
chose,
the
founded
suspicion
language.
that's
why
i
was
wondering
why
you
picked
it
up.
justice
white
well
can
a
state
require
that
all
trucks
be
stopped?
justice
white
every
state
does
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
at
a
border
when
a
truck
is
going
through
the
state?
justice
white
oh.
but
they
stop...
at
the
border
of
colorado,
and
there
isn't
any
fruit
to
inspect,
they
just
stop
them
to
see
what,
see
if
they
are
in
compliance
with
the
laws.
justice
white
but
that...
wasn't
all
over
the
state.
justice
white
they
didn't
stop
every
truck
in
the
north
end
of
the
state--
justice
white
--that
was
going
east
or
west
at
a
certain
time.
this
was
at
a
certain
location?
interstate
86.
justice
white
and
not
just
anywhere
on
highway
86.
