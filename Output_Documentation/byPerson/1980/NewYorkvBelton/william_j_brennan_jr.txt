what
time
of
day
was
this?
justice
jr.
five
jackets?
justice
jr.
did
he
search
the
others,
too?
justice
jr.
but
the
id
card
also
was
in
this
jacket?
justice
jr.
did
he
secure
them
in
any
way
when
they
were
standing--
justice
jr.
--just
stood
outside
the
car?
justice
jr.
did
you
say
it
was
a
two-door
vehicle?
justice
jr.
then
did
he
have
to
get
in
it
and--
justice
jr.
--i
take
it
any
of
the
four,
had
he
been
able
to
reach
it,
would
have
had
to
get
in
the
same
way,
would
he?
justice
jr.
and
why
did
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
say
it
was
not?
justice
jr.
no,
but
don't
we
have
to
take
the
facts
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
they
decided
the
case?
justice
jr.
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that?
anything
in
this
court
that's
ever
suggested
we
do
that?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
did
the
officer
get
them
to
the
police
station
in
his?
justice
jr.
he
put
the
four
of
them
in...
what?
his
car?
justice
jr.
and
drove
them
all?
justice
jr.
mr.
frey,
is
this
an
argument
that
because
the
jacket
was
capable
of
being
worn,
we
ought
to
treat
its
search
as
we
would
treat
one
if
he
were
wearing
the
jacket?
justice
jr.
you
mean,
after
they
got
out
of
the
car?
justice
jr.
obviously,
they
were,
while
they
were
in
the
car,
initially.
justice
jr.
well,
do
you
read
it
as
saying
that
there's
nothing
that
could
possibly
support
that
exception
because
in
fact
they
were
outside
the
car?
justice
jr.
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
you
read
your
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
and
you
argue
in
agreement
that
therefore
the
exception
cannot
apply
under
this
set
of
facts?
justice
jr.
mr.
cambria,
does
this
record
show
anything
about
these
four?
were
they
students
or
something
like
that
on
their
way
to
school
or
what
were
they?
justice
jr.
were
they
young
men?
justice
jr.
late
teenagers
or
something?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
no,
now,
wait
a
minute,
mr.
cambria,
why
isn't
that
draper?
justice
jr.
he
walks
out
of
the
car
with
it
on
his
arm
and
the
officer
takes
it
from
him.
how
does
that
differ
from
the
case
that
was
taken
from
draper?
justice
jr.
oh,
well,
frankly,
i
thought
what
you
were
arguing
was
the
difference
between,
distinction
between
draper
and
this
case
and
between
the
hypothetical
my
brother
white
has
just
given
you,
and
this
case;
is
that
they
were
not
within
grabbable
distance--
justice
jr.
--of
the
coat.
justice
jr.
well,
i
guess
it's
wise
not
to
continue
to
argue
that
rather
than
to
debate
whether
this
was--
justice
jr.
--and
suggest
that
draper
has
been
qualified
by
chadwick.
justice
jr.
well,
suppose,
in
this
very
case,
instead
of
the
jacket
lying
on
the
seat
he'd
been
wearing
it,
one
of
the
four,
this
defendant,
when
he
walked
out.
the
police
officer
asked
him
to
take
it
off,
he
did,
and
handed
it
to
him.
that
would
be
draper,
wouldn't
it?
justice
jr.
wouldn't
that
be
draper?
justice
jr.
you
mean
it
wasn't
enough
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
wait
a
minute,
you've
said,
under
the
overpowering
theory,
or
your
said,
under--
