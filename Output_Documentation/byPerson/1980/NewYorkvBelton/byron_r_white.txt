justice
white
so
that
if
this
jacket,
if
he
had
had
this
jacket
on,
it
would
have
been
searchable
under
robinson?
justice
white
or
even
carrying
it
in
his
hand?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
you
make
a
probable
cause
arrest
in
a
car,
and
everybody
concedes
you're
entitled
to
search
the
trunk
of
the
car.
justice
white
you
find
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
a
briefcase,
a
plastic
sack,
and
a
jacket
with
a
zipper
pocket.
i
guess
you
would
concede
that
you
couldn't
search,
under
our
cases,
you
couldn't
search
the
briefcase?
justice
white
and
the
plastic
bag
is
involved
in
belton,
i
mean,
as
in
robbins?
justice
white
how
about
the
jacket?
justice
white
you
wouldn't
argue
incident
to
arrest
there,
would
you?
justice
white
and
so
then
it
would
be
a--
justice
white
--it
would
be
a
robbins-type
consideration?
justice
white
so
what
about
a
lady's
purse?
say,
the
sole
driver
in
a
car
is
a
lady
and
there's
purse
on
the
back
seat,
and
they
have
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
white
supposing
that
it
is,
you
would
say,
they
may
search
it?
justice
white
what
about
a
briefcase
that's
on
the
front
seat
beside
the
person
you
arrest?
justice
white
the
same?
justice
white
otherwise,
you
would--
justice
white
--and
so
you
would
say,
if
you
arrested
on
the
street,
if
you
arrest
a
person
on
the
street
carrying
a
briefcase,
you
can
obviously
search
the
briefcase?
justice
white
if
it's
unlocked?
justice
white
but
what
if
it
were
just
zippered?
draper?
justice
white
we've
certainly
sustained
as
an
incident
search,
a
search
of
a
zippered
bag,
in
draper,
draper.
justice
white
up
until
they
were
unsettled
by
chadwick
and
sanders,
maybe?
justice
white
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
have
suggested
that
in
chadwick
that
footlocker
could
have
been
searched
if
the
arrested
had
taken
place
in
the
station,
while
they
were
sitting
on...
right
after
the
dog
had
decided
what
was
in
the?
justice
white
well,
"but
for"
is...
that's
a
rather
big
"but
for",
is
it
not?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
think
that
there's
any
inference
to
be
drawn
from
chadwick
that
the
search
in
that
case
could
not
have
been
justified
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
you
would
be
making
the
argument
you
would
be
making
now
if
when
they
arrested
the
people,
just
as
they
were,
while
the
footlocker
was
in
the
station
wagon,
that
they
could
have
searched
the
footlocker
incident
to
arrest
except
for
the
fact
it
was
locked?
justice
white
mr.
cambria,
there
never
was
any
finding
in
this
case,
was
there,
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
jacket?
justice
white
and
the
claim
is
that
it
should
be
searched
just
incident
to
arrest,
whether
there
is
probable
cause
or
not?
justice
white
yes.
and
it
is
still
is,
isn't
it?
justice
white
it
still
is.
on
that
basis,
if
it
isn't
searchable
incident
to
arrest,
it
wouldn't
be
searchable
at
all,
because
unless
somebody
found
there
was
probable
cause?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
i
know,
but
in
this
case
you
would
still
have
the
problem
of
proving
probable
cause,
if
you
went
for
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
cambria,
you
wouldn't...
if
he
had
patted
down
this
jacket,
which
he
did,
and
he
had
discovered
something
that
it
felt
like
a
gun,
you
still
wouldn't
suggest
that
he
could
search
it,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
well,
you'd
make
the
same
argument
you're
making
now:
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
jacket,
you
go
get
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
have
probable
cause,
maybe,
to
believe
there's
something
in
the
jacket.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
taken
from
him,
and
once
it
was
taken
from
him,
it
was
in
complete
control
of
the
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
could
he
get
in
the
zipper
bag?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
draper
said
that
that
was
a
good
search
incident
to
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
argument,
could
the
outcome
in
draper
be
the
same?
once
the
officer
arrests
a
man
and
takes
the
bag
from
him
and
he's
got
it
in
his
hands?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
if
one
of
these
persons,
as
he
was
getting
out
of
the
car,
he
was
carrying
a
jacket
in
his
hand,
the
officer
took
it
from
him--
justice
byron
r.
white
--patted
it
down,
didn't
feel
anything
like
a
weapon
or
anything,
and
then
he
searched
it,
just
like
he
did
here.
wouldn't
you
say
he
could
not
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
draper.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
was
trying
to
find
out
what
your
argument
is,
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
would
qualify
draper,
that
your
argument
would
qualify
draper.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
the
court
below,
on
its
argument,
the
exclusive
control
test,
wouldn't
it
qualify
draper.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
suggest
that
there's
no
need
to
depart
from
draper
in
this
case?
justice
white
nor
in
any
draper
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cambria,
i
take
it
that
when
you
arrest
someone
in
connection
with
a
car,
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
your
grabbable
reach
range,
you'll
have
to
rely
on
the
automobile
search,
the
automobile
theory,
which
requires
probable
cause
to
believe
that
where
you
are
searching
you
may
find
what
you're
searching
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
you
also
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
you're
going
to
find
something
in
those
areas.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
agree
with
the
united
states,
i
gather,
if
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
opinion
below
is
read
as
establishing
a
control
test,
you
don't
defend
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
if
a
man
is
carrying
his
jacket
when
he
gets
out
of
the
car
and
they
arrest
him
and
the
officer
takes
his
jacket
from
him,
then
it's
under
the
complete
control
of
the
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
the
court
below
meant
that
you
couldn't
search
that
jacket,
you
do
not
defend
that
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
take
your
view,
i
take
it
that
any
container
in
a
car,
any
piece
of
evidence
in
a
car,
or
in
the
interior
of
the
car,
or
anything
in
any
container
in
the
car,
is
searchable
and
seizable
incident
to
the
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference...
to
you
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
whether
the
jacket
was
on
the
floor,
or
the
back
seat,
or
anywhere
in
the
interior
of
the
car,
or
whether
what
the
officer
seized
was
a
briefcase?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
was
a
briefcase
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
jacket,
you
would
say
it
could
be
searched?
