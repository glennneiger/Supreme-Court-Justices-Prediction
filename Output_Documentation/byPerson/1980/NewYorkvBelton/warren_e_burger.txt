chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
new
york
v.
belton.
mr.
harvey,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
trial
did
they
disclaim
any
ownership?
or
any
move
to
suppress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--do
we
have
any
review
of
that
issue
when
highest
court
in
the
state
has,
even
if
they
have
distorted
their
own
law?
can
we
correct
the
errors
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
on
error
in
construing
state
law?
chief
justice
burger
we
do?
what's
the
federal
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
merely
found
us
a
new
set
of
facts
which
the
dissenting
judge
said
was
wrong,
but
is
that
something
we
can
reexamine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
refer
to
that
case,
you
are
calling
on
the
plain
view
doctrine,
are
you,
that
evidence
was
in
plain
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
referring
to
the
chimel
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
plain
view
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
a
search
for
weapons
at
that
stage?
could
he
search
for
that
purpose
when
he
was
one
against
four?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
any
time
after
he
stopped
the
car,
could
he
make
certain
that
there
wasn't
any
weapon
that
might
be
used
to
shoot
him
down?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
anything
in
the
car
that
might
contain
a
weapon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it's
his
jacket,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
it
were
two
feet,
three,
or
four?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
you
have
a
bright
line
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
word
"reasonable",
if
bright
line
means
a
per
se
rule
that's
easy
for
anyone
to
apply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
this
jacket
was
near
enough
at
hand
that
it's
within
chimel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
someone
suggested
to
you,
the...
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall...
the
cocaine
was
not
in
plain
view,
but
the
jacket
in
which
the
pocket
containing
the
cocaine
was
in
plain
view.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
unzipped
if
it
makes
any
difference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
tell
us
that
there
was
an
id
card
with
his
name
on
along
with
the
coat?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
any
question
about
ownership,
you
would
say,
is
resolved
by
that
id
card?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
though
he
had
his
name
on
it,
as
some
people
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
have
much
choice
about
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
burger
you
don't
have
much
choice
about
that
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
0
[recess.]
mr.
frey,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
will
take
some
note
of
the
fact
that
in
chadwick
the
search
was
not
at
the
time
or
place
of
the
arrest
but
long
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if...
i
suppose
what
you're
driving
at
is
that,
conceivably,
the
officer
might
have
said
to
the
four
of
them,
you
get
in
your
car,
and
don't
get
more
than
two
car
lengths
ahead
of
me
and
go
to
the
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
you're
going
to
destruction
of
the
evidence
if
that
had
happened
without
any
preliminary
search.
he
could
have
dropped
the
cocaine
out
the
window
of
the
car.
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
whatever
car
they
were
in,
the
policeman
had
possession,
i
take
it,
of
the
cocaine
while
he
was
driving
them
to
the
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
cambria.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
he's
a
fast-draw
policeman
and
therefore
didn't
have
to
draw
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
opperman
was
an
inventory
search
of
an
abandoned
car.
isn't
that
somewhat
different
from
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
purpose
of
an
inventory
search
is
in
part,
at
least,
to
protect
the
officers
from
claims
of
possible
theft
or
disappearance
of
the
materials,
so
they
would
go
into
the
pockets
if
they
were
going
to
make
an
inventory,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
good
would
it
do
them
to
make
an
inventory
search
if
they
didn't
look
in
the
pockets?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
did
chimel
speak
in
terms
of
"grabbable
reach"
or
"reach"?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
was
the
emphasis
on
plain
view,
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
plain
view?
but--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--plain
view
comes
first.
you
don't
know
whether
it's
within
reach,
grabbable
or
otherwise,
until
you
see
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
were
to
deal
with
the
consent
issue,
that
was
not
decided
by,
or
treated
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
search
of
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
statement
made
about
the
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
trunk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
comparable
statement
like
that
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
harvey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
