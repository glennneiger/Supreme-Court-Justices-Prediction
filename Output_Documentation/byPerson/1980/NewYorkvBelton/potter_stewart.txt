justice
stewart
maybe
in
new
york
a
speeding
offense
would
not
support
a
custodial
arrest.
justice
stewart
that's
your
answer
then.
justice
stewart
well,
there
was
no
claim
in
chadwick,
was
there,
that
that
was
a
search
incidental
to
arrest?
justice
stewart
i
didn't
think
so.
that
wasn't
an
issue
before
the
court.
justice
stewart
well,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
bottomed
upon
the
premise
that
the
arrest
was
a
lawful
custodial
arrest.
justice
stewart
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
search
and
seizure
were
within
the
permissible
scope
of
a
search
and
seizure
incident
to
that
lawful
custodial
arrest?
justice
stewart
well,
that's
the
issue
before
us.
justice
stewart
is
this
within
the
permissible
geographic
scope
of
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
custodial
arrest?
justice
stewart
there's
no
question,
is
there,
about
the
permissible
temporal
scope?
justice
stewart
there
is
no
question,
at
least
by
hypothesis,
that
this
was
a
lawful
custodial
arrest?
justice
stewart
so
the
only
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
is
within
the
permissible
geographic
scope
of
such
a
search--
justice
stewart
--and
seizure.
justice
stewart
well,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
was
within
the
chimel
confines.
that's
the
only
issue
before
us.
justice
stewart
neither
chadwick
nor
sanders
involved,
and
i
think
you'll
agree
with
this,
a
claim
that
the
search
was
incident
to
a
lawful
custodial
arrest,
did
it?
justice
stewart
it
was
discussed
in
chadwick.
justice
stewart
and
the
findings
were
made...
and
discussed
in
a
footnote,
i
guess,
in
sanders?
justice
stewart
therefore
it
was
not
within
the
geographic
vicinity.
justice
stewart
right.
and
that
in
chadwick
the
statement
was
made
that
it
was
not
within
the
temporal--
justice
stewart
--confines
of
chimel,
so
the
argument
could
not
have
been...
or
the
search
and
seizure
could
not
have
been
supported
as
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
but
neither
case
involved
the
claim
that
it
was,
did
it?
justice
stewart
the
argument
was
not
made
in
either
case.
justice
stewart
well,
the
opinions
of
the
court
indicate
that
the
various
arguments--
justice
stewart
--would
not
have
been
valid.
justice
stewart
--the
overpowering
theory
would
depend,
i
suppose,
if
i
understand
your
shorthand
for
the
theory,
upon
how
many
arrestees
there
were
and
how
many
policemen
there
were
arresting
them,
and
which
ones
were--
justice
stewart
--the
overpowering
theory
depends
at
least
in
part,
i
suppose,
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
one
arresting
officer
and
four
arrestees.
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
therefore
if
there
were
only
one
arrestee,
then
he
might--
