justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there
were
five
jackets?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harvey,
judge
gabrielli
in
his
dissent
makes
some
point
of
the
fact
that
under
your
state
procedural
rules
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
cannot
make
new
findings
of
fact
where
the
supreme
court
and
the
appellate
division
have
made
concurrent
findings.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
the
person
of
the
arrestee
can
be
searched?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
in
robinson
we
said
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
in
a
particular
case
all
of
the
factors
might
not
add
up
to
considerable
danger,
if
it
was
a
custodial
arrest,
the
rule
was
that
there
could
be
a
full
field
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
individual.
so
that
we
don't
want
consideration
of
individualized
factors
in
that
situation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
you're
dealing
with
basically
two
separate
doctrines,
aren't
you,
the
robinson
doctrine
of
searching
as
a
result
of
a
custodial
arrest
and
the
chimel
doctrine
of
how
broad
an
area
surrounding
the
arrestee
can
you
search
in
order
to
make
sure
that
he
doesn't
either
destroy
evidence
or
pull
a
gun
on
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
frey,
you
wouldn't
contend
that
the
cases
from
this
court
that
you
have
referred
to
are
kind
of
a
unified
whole
easily
applicable
by
any
lower
court
or
any
policeman,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
possibility
of
them
not
with
weapons
but
simply
with
their
own
bodies
overpowering
him
while
he
was
looking
in
the
back
seat?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
long
would
it
have
taken
four
of
them,
acting
unison,
to
have
frustrated
the
officer's
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
chimel
was
at
least
a
one-on-one
situation,
not
a
four-on-one
situation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
was
arrested
for
speeding,
wasn't
he?
i
mean
that's
part
of--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
don't
challenge
the
probable
cause
for
that
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
arrest
for
marijuana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
our
edwards
case
then,
which
said
that
although
the
search
took
place
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
arrest
or
two
hours
after
the
arrest,
since
it
could
have
been
done
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
it
was
good
at
two
hours
afterwards?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
certainly
have
the
temporal
disparity
in
edwards
that
you
do
not
have
here
and
that
you
don't
have
in
chimel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
then
it
makes
no
difference
when
the
person
is
arrested?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
in
edwards,
it
was
held
that
it
would
not
invalidate
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
not...
in
a
sense,
a
constitutional
fact,
if
we're
talking
about
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
if
there
was
no
finding,
we
are
entitled
to
make
our
judgment
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
said,
this
was
not
within
grabbable
reach--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--whereabouts
in
the
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
regard
that
as
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cambria,
let
me
go
back
to
the
footnote
that
you
have
referred
to
in
chief
judge
cooke's
opinion,
at
a-81
of
the
appendix.
he
says,
"one
searches
the
record
in
vain
for
support
of
the
dissenter's
claim
that
at
the
time
of
arrest...
the
point
from
which
the
predicate
for
the
warrantless
search
is
measured
#.
"
then
he
goes
on,
"indeed,
the
facts,
as
found
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
affirmed
by
the
appellate
division,
were
to
the
effect
that
the
jacket
was
searched
after
the
defendant
was
removed
from
the
vehicle
and
then
placed
under
arrest.
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that
suggests
more
the
exclusive
control
type
of
thing
that
the
government
is
arguing
against,
rather
than
the
grabbable
reach
thing.
