mr.
harvey,
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question
about
the
authority
for
the
search?
there
were
two
offenses
that
had
been
committed,
one
by
the
driver
in
speeding,
and
then
secondly
all
four,
presumably,
were
in
possession
of
marijuana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
had
only
the
former,
namely,
a
speeding
offense,
would
you
still
say
there
would
be
authority
to
search
the
jacket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that
it
was
a
sufficiently
reckless
driving
and
maybe
he
smelled
alcohol
on
the
breath
of
the
driver,
but
no
one
else,
so
there
was
cause,
probable
cause
to
make
a
custodial
arrest
of
the
driver,
would
that
entitle
you
to
search
the
jackets
in
the
back
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
guess
you've
changed
your
answer
to
my
question,
then,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
take
it,
when
a
man
is
stopped
for
speeding,
maybe
he's
got
alcohol
on
his
breath,
there
are
three
other
people
in
the
car,
some
of
them
might
have
a
weapon,
there
might
be
a
weapon
in
the
jacket.
would
he
have
a
right
to
search
the
back
of
the
car,
search
a
jacket
in
the
back
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
answer
is
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you've
changed
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
robinson
was
just
a
one-person
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
suggest
that
the
right
to
make
a
custodial
arrest
of
the
driver
entitles
you
to
search
the
person
of
all
passengers,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
for
marijuana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view,
could
the
officer
open
the
glove
compartment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cambria,
maybe
this
is
too
trivial
a
question,
but
you
have
used
the
term
"grabbable
reach"
repeatedly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
a
grabbable
reach
a
greater
or
a
lesser
area
than
a
just
plain
reach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cambria,
when
you...
as
i
understand
the
facts
here,
after
the
officer
stopped
the
car,
the
driver
rolled
down
the
left
window
of
the
car,
and
the
officer
when
he
went
into
the
back
seat
was
on
one
side
of
the
car
and
the
four
individuals
were
on
the
other
side.
were
they
on
the
left
side
or
the
right
side
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
door
did
he
go
in,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
went
in
the
driver's
door.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
window
was
open,
i
suppose
it's
conceivable,
even
though
they're
outside
the
car,
they
could
have
reached
in
and
grabbed
the
jacket.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
four
individuals
were
separated
from
one
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
all
behind
the
car?
