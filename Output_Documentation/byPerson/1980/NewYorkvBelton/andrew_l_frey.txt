mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
has
asserted
in
his
brief
that
we
wholly
disagree
with
the
arguments
of
the
state,
and
i
just
wanted
to
begin
by
making
the
point
that
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
state
in
its
arguments
that
this
was
within
the
chimel
scope,
focusing
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
officer's
actions
under
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
we
think
that,
however,
that
that
kind
of
inquiry
which
is
amply...
the
state's
position
is
amply
supported,
if
it
be
made
in
this
case,
is
not
an
inquiry
that
needs
to
be
made.
our
argument
addresses,
then,
the
question
of
whether
a
valid
search
incident
to
an
arrest
can
be
justified
solely
by
reference
to
the
spatial
limitations;
that
is,
whether
it
comes
within
the
chimel
scope,
and
the
temporal
limitations
during
the
arrest
process.
we
were
concerned
about
the
exclusive
control
notion
which
both
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
the
8th
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
benson
case,
in
which
we
have
a
cert
petition
pending,
have
imported
from
chadwick,
where
i
think
it
had
quite
a
different
meaning
and
intention,
into
this
situation.
our
argument
in
this
case,
contrary
to
what
respondent
has
suggested
in
his
brief,
is
not
intended
to
undermine
either
thoroughly,
as
he
says,
or
in
any
way,
chimel,
or
chadwick,
or
sanders.
it
doesn't
call
the
validity
of
those
decisions
into
question
at
all.
the
permissible
scope
of
the
search
of
the
person
of
an
arrestee
incident
to
arrest
has
been
settled
in
robinson
and
that
scope
is
broad
indeed.
this
case
concerns
the
aspect
of
a
search
incident
doctrine
involving
a
search
of
containers
or
items
of
some
kind
that
are
nearby
but
not
on
the
person
or
being
worn
by
the
arrested
individual.
and
our
position
is
that
such
nearby
items
like
the
items
on
the
person
should
be
subject
to
the
same
test
for
a
valid
search
incident
to
arrest
as
long
as
the
search
is
made
during
the
period
of
the
arrest.
we
would
not
contend,
with
respect
to
a
separate
container
that
may
have
been
seized,
that
the
edwards
principle
that
a
search
incident
to
arrest
can
occur
later,
would
be
applicable
to
such
containers.
now,
the
first
question
in
analyzing
the
case
is
whether,
when
the
officer
went
and
seized
respondent's
jacket,
the
jacket
was
at
that
time
within
the
spatial
area
defined
by
this
court's
opinion
in
chimel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no,
it
would
not
have
to
be
a
jacket.
it
could
be
a
shopping
bag
or
some
other
item.
it's
not
because
it
was
capable
of
being
worn,
but
because
it
was
an
area
from
which
a
person
could
secure,
possibly
secure
a
weapon
or
destructible
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
questions
that
i
would
ask
are
at
the
time
the
purse
is
seized,
is
it
within
the
area
where
the
woman
who
has
been
arrested
could
possibly
lunge
for
it
and
grab
it?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it's
still
during
the
arrest
process.
if
it's
been
put
in
the
back
of
the
patrol
car
and
then
they
come
back
and
start--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
the
same.
that
is,
if--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--to
follow
what
the
court
has
held
in
robinson,
it
does
not
turn
on
the
privacy
expectation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it's
unlocked.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
have
difficulty
with
the
suggestion.
and
one
of
the
reasons
we
did
not
argue--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
the
question
the
court
has
to
answer
in
this
situation
is
whether
it
is
something
to
which
somebody
might
possibly
have
gained
access
during
the
course
of
the
arrest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
would
say
a
zippered
container
would
be
searchable
incident
to
arrest;
yes.
but
i
would
have
difficulty
with
the
locked
footlocker
in
chadwick.
and
we
do
not
argue
for--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
have...
i
don't
think
that
the
court
held
in
chadwick
that
a
search
then
and
there
would
necessarily
not
have
been
incident
to
arrest.
so,
if
we
had
such
a
case
it
would
be
arguable,
but
i
doubt
that
i
would
argue
it.
now,
whatever
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
spatial
area
that
chimel
defines
as
incident
to
arrest,
which
is
the
area
from
which
you
arrest,
a
person
might
gain
possession
of
a
weapon,
or
destructible
evidence,
is
a
matter
that
necessarily
has
to
be
delineated
from
case
to
case,
and
this
court
has
not
had
very
much
occasion
to
do
so.
but
i
would
note
that
if
the
arrested
individual
is
standing
unsecured
outside
his
automobile,
i
think
the
interior
of
the
automobile,
not
the
trunk,
but
the
interior
passenger
compartment,
is
under
adams
v.
williams,
would
have
been
in
the
scope
of
search
and
seizure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
when
the
court
recessed
i
was
discussing
the
spatial
limitations,
the
limitations
of
the
chimel
test.
and
it
is
our
view,
and
i
think
adams
v.
williams
is
precedent
for
this,
that
the
interior
of
a
car
is
within
the
spatial
grabbing
area
for
a
person
who
is
standing
right
outside
the
car
at
the
time
of
arrest.
but
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
of
the
8th
circuit
in
our
benson
case
seems
to
go
beyond
that
and
suggests
that
even
though
an
item
is
seized
from
within
the
chimel
area,
there
is
a
separate
inquiry
whether
at
the
time
it
is
searched
it
is
within
the
exclusive
control
of
the
officer
searching
it.
and
that
test,
which
as
far
as
i
know,
is
novel
to
our
jurisprudence
prior
to
chadwick,
comes
from
certain
language
that
was
used
in
chadwick,
and
i
think
in
a
quite
different
context.
there
are
several
difficulties
that
we
perceive
with
the
exclusive
control
notion
that
has
been
used
by
the
lower
court
in
several
of
these
cases.
first,
i
would
make
the
point
that
it
runs
afoul
of
the
holding
in
adams
v.
williams,
which
was
a
case
where,
according
to
the
record
that
was
the
appendix
in
this
court,
williams
had
been
arrested.
the
officer
then
waited
until
additional
officers
arrived
on
the
scene,
at
which
point
the
car
was
searched.
now,
it
was
not
a
subject
of
analysis
in
the
court's
opinion,
but
the
court
did
uphold
the
search
of
the
car
and
the
seizures
of
the
heroin
found
in
the
car
as
incident
to
william's
arrest.
the
same
is
true
in
draper
where,
i
assume,
at
the
time
the
zipper
bag
was
searched
it
was
within
the
exclusive
control
of
the
officer
in
this
sense.
and
the
problem
with
the
exclusive
control
test,
the
way
it's
being
used,
is
that
it
essentially
eliminates
searches
of
any
item
that
is
capable
of
being
picked
up
and
carried
away
by
the
officer
as
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
that
in
the
area
of
search
incident
to
arrest
the
cases
to
date
have
been
reasonably
consistent,
and
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
don't
think
that
chadwick...
chadwick
apparently
has
been
the
source;
sanders,
i
don't
think,
has
anything
to
do
with
search
incident
to
arrest,
but
chadwick
has
been
the
source
of
some
confusion
for
the
lower
courts,
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
inconsistency
in
this
court's
treatment
of
the
subject
that
has
prompted
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
did
not
make
that
claim;
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
it
was
a
point
that
was
discussed
in
the
court's
opinion,
and
in
just
a
second
i
will
get
to
what
the
court
said
about
it
because
i
think
it
is
important.
but
i
wanted
to
make
the
point
first
that
the
nature
of
a
search
of
an
item,
a
parcel,
a
jacket,
a
purse,
or
something
like
that,
in
order
to
be
searched
it
really
has
to
be
within
the
control
of
the
officer.
presumably
the
officer
and
the
arrested
individual
are
not
having
a
tug
of
war
over
the
item.
so
in
the
sense
that
in
benson
and
in
this
case
the
court
seemed
to
have
used
exclusive
control,
it
totally
eliminates
search
incident
to
arrest
of
items
that
are
not
on
the
person
of
the
individual.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
just
coming
to
that
point.
what
was
omitted
in
the
discussion
of
chadwick
is
the
language
that
immediately
preceded
the
exclusive
control
language
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
potential
danger
lurking
in
all
custodial
arrests
make
warrantless
searches
of
items
within
the
immediate
control
area
reasonable
without
requiring
the
arresting
officer
to
calculate
the
probability
of
weapons--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
the
arrest
had
taken
place
in
the
station
and
they
had
been
sitting
on
it,
i
would
say
that
it
could
have
been
searched
incident
to
arrest
but
for
the
fact
that
it
was
locked
and
therefore
it
was
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
the
big
"but
for".
but
in
any
event
we
did
not
make
the
argument.
but
the
point
in
chadwick
was
that
the
court
was
merely
referring
to
settled
doctrine
which
had
been
settled
in
preston,
that
a
search
subsequent
to,
some
hours
later,
after
the
arrest
has
been
completed,
is
no
longer
incident
to
the
arrest.
it
was
not
at
all
talking
about
a
situation
of
a
search
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
indeed,
the
exclusive
control
argument
seems
to
me
totally
inconsistent
with
robinson,
because
in
robinson,
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
his
dissent,
at
the
time
the
cigarette
pack
was
searched
it
was
in
the
control
of
the
officer.
the
officer
could
have
taken
it
and
put
it
away
somewhere
out
of
the
reach
of
the
arrested
individual.
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
once
the
court
has
rejected
that
with
respect
to
items
removed
from
the
person
of
the
individual,
there
is
precious
little
logical
basis
for
treating
it
differently
if
the
item
is
found
nearby.
earlier,
during
my
brother's
argument,
the
question
came
up
about
whether
he
had
been
wearing
a
jacket,
carrying
a
jacket,
had
it
down
on
the
park
bench,
or
so
on.
of
course,
once,
if
the
jacket
is
removed
from
his
person
and
the
officer
is
holding
it
and
he
starts
looking
through
its
pockets,
he
has
exclusive
control
in
the
sense
that
the
lower
courts
were
talking
about.
so
i
don't
see
any
justification
in
this
court's
cases
which
i
think
are
fairly
consistent
in
this
area
for
saying
that
if
the
item
is
sitting
next
to
the
person
or
sitting
five
feet
away,
that
the
scope
of
a
permissible
search
incident
to
arrest
is
any
different
from--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--what
chadwick
held
was
that
the
search
at
the
station
house,
an
hour
and
a
half
later,
after
the
people
were
presumably
locked
in
cells
someplace
else,
could
not
be
justified
as
incident
to
the
arrest.
we
don't
question
that
holding
here.
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--except
for
the
lock.
except
for
the
locking.
and
i
wanted
to
make
the
point
that
there
is
talk
about
the
privacy
interest,
and
the
high
privacy
interest
in
the
pockets
of
the
jacket
and
so
on.
and
i
think
when
we
are
dealing
with...
that
argument
would
be
very
pertinent
to
the
robbins
case
which
was
argued
earlier
today,
where
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
warrant
is
required.
that
argument
is
either
wholly
irrelevant
or
at
least
not
very
significant
when
we
are
talking
about
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
because
the
search
incident
to
arrest
is
not
justified
by
probable
cause.
there
is
no
question
of
a
warrant.
i
think
the
court
made
the
point
in
a
footnote
in
chadwick
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
type
of
search
like
an
inventory
search,
which
is
not
justified
by
probable
cause,
cases
dealing
with
the
warrant
requirement
are
not
really
opposite.
the
argument
is
particularly
inappropriate,
it
seems
to
me,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
jacket,
because
a
jacket
is,
of
course,
the
very
kind
of
thing
that
is
most
likely
to
be
subject
to
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
since
a
person
will
usually
be
wearing
it
or
carrying
it
at
the
time
of
arrest.
the
fortuitous
fact
that
he
had
put
it
down
in
the
car
does
not
matter
as
long
as
at
the
time
it
was
seized
it's
still
within
the
chimel
geographical
scope
of
the
area
within
which
a
search
incident
is
permissible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
one
of
the
important
reasons
for
the
search
incident,
when
you
have
a
number
of
items
like
this.
the
officer
may
have
to
know
what
disposition
can
be
appropriately
made,
which
ones
of
them
are
dangerous,
might...
you
know,
he
has
to
locate
weapons
or--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
would
be
a
risk,
yes.
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
permit
the
search
incident
to
arrest
is
that
you
have
these
items
of
property
that
are
in
the
area
of
the
arrested
individual
and
as
part
of
the
process
of
stabilizing
the
situation
you
have
to
determine
which
items
are
dangerous
or
contain
evidence,
so
that
you
know
how
to
handle
them.
now,
i
wanted
to
mention--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
remember
from
my
reading
of
the
record--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
it's...
i
don't
think
he
put
the
cocaine
in
any
place
where
mr.
belton
could
reach
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i...
but
if
he
knew
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
part
of
the
record
that's
in
the
appendix,
i
don't
recall
that
it
shows.
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
it
obviously
was
very
valuable
for
him
to
know
that
there
was
this
quantity
of
cocaine,
so
that
he
could
take
whatever
precautions
were
feasible
under
the
circumstances
to
prevent
it
being
destroyed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
assume
so.
thank
you.
