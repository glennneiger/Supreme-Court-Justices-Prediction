were
any
of
them
armed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
yes,
the
officer
had
a
weapon.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
get
this,
he
automatically
can
be
overpowered.
you
used
the
word,
"automatically".
i
don't--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--couldn't
he
have
called
for
help?
isn't
that
usually
what's
done
when
there's
a
one-officer
patrol--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
they
usually
call
for
help.
justice
thurgood
marshall
gone?
he
could
have
just
picked
up
the
phone
right
there
in
his
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i'm--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--with
four
people
in
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
after
he
got
ahold
of
it,
the
occupant
couldn't
have
gotten
it,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
arguing
the
robinson
case.
i'm
asking
you
a
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
had
a
right
to
search
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
a
right
to
search
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
you're
interrupted,
where
was
the
clear
view
of
this
cocaine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
clear
view
of
the
cocaine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--he
could
have
a
right
to
search.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
between
search
and
pat
down,
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that's
what
you
meant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
my
trouble.
the
case
just
before
said
they
want
a
bright
line
and
you
don't
want
a
bright
line.
now,
who
shall
we
go
with?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
that
jacket
belonged
to
somebody
else,
because
it
was
a
fifth
jacket?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
a
right
to
go
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
unzip
it?
even
if
it
belonged
to
somebody
else?
listen
to
me,
even
if
it
belonged
to
somebody
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
somebody
else's
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
just
too
bad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
instead
of
doing
that,
they
put
all
four
of
them
and
their
jackets
in
the
car
with
the
policeman,
in
the
same
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what...
that's
what
the
lawyer
who
tried
the
case
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
were
all
in
the
same
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
they?
weren't
they
in
the
same
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don't
you
remind
justice
rehnquist
that
the
man
himself
said
he
had
a
gun
and
he
wasn't
worried.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
the
only
one
that
was
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
we
got
to
go
through
the
record
to
find
out
if
it
was
reachable
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
any
findings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
there's
a
possibility
of
overpowering
when
you
leave
four
of
them
in
the
back
of
the
car?
behind
the
car?
you're
going
to
get
in
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
i
mean,
that's
a
danger
of
being
overpowered?
you
left
four
of
them
back
there
all
by
themselves.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
got
in
the
car
and
got
back
out,
and
nothing
happens.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you've
got
to
worry
about
overpowering?
