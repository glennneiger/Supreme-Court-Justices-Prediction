mr.
james
r.
harvey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
legality
of
a
search
conducted
by
a
police
officer
of
a
jacket
belonging
to
the
respondent
and
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence...
in
this
case,
cocaine...
which
was
obtained
from
that
jacket.
the
basic
issue
boils
down
essentially
to
whether
or
not
the
search
was
permissible
as
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
which
was
one
of
the
several
well-recognized
exceptions
to
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
by
way,
just
very
briefly,
of
background
of
the
case
and
how
it
got
here.
the
respondent
moved
to
suppress
the
cocaine
at
the
trial
level;
that
motion
was
denied
after
a
hearing.
the
evidence
was
held
admissible;
the
respondent
subsequently
pled
guilty
and
appealed
the
case
to
the
new
york
state
intermediate
appellate
court,
which
unanimously
held
that
the
search
was
proper
of
the
jacket
in
this
case,
as
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
the
respondent
further
appealed
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
in
a
divided
opinion
reversed
the
appellate
court,
lower
appellate
court,
and
held
that
the
officer
had
in
effect
reduced
the
jacket
to
his
exclusive
control
when
he,
if
you
will,
picked
it
up,
and
therefore
a
warrant
was
at
that
time
necessary
under
the
law.
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
i
could
very
briefly
run
through
them...
i
think
they're
very
important,
and
they're
pretty
much...
well,
they're
not
in
dispute
by
either
counsel
for
the
respondent
or
myself,
but
i'd
like
to
go
through,
and
start
out
by
saying
that
it
was
on
april
ninth
1978,
that
the
trooper
nicot
in
this
case,
a
state
policeman,
was
patrolling
the
new
york
state
thruway,
an
interstate
highway,
and
he
spotted
the
respondent's
vehicle
traveling
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
on
the
highway.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
mid-morning,
your
honor.
and
he
pulled
over
the
vehicle.
there
were
four
male
occupants,
two
in
the
back
and
two
in
the
front.
when
he
went
up
to
the
window...
it
was
rolled
down
by
the
driver;
he
went
to
the
driver's
side...
he
smelled
fresh
burning
marijuana
and
observed
on
the
floor
a
supergold
stamped
container
which
he
knew
from
his
training
to
be
a
container
that
normally
contains
marijuana.
at
that
point
in
time
he
directed
all
four
occupants
to
leave
the
vehicle,
which
was
a
two-door
vehicle.
they
got
out
of
the
vehicle.
he
at
that
point
in
time
retrieved
the
supergold
container,
which
did
contain
marijuana,
in
fact,
and
some
four
or
five
"roaches"
or
burned
marijuana
cigarettes
in
the
ashtray
of
the
front
portion
of
the
vehicle.
at
that
point
in
time
he
again
patted
down
or
searched
further
all
of
the
four
occupants
of
the
vehicle,
read
them
their
miranda
rights,
placed
them
under
arrest
for
possession
of
marijuana.
at
this
time
we
had
four
defendants
outside
of
the
motor
vehicle
there
on
the
expressway.
the
officer
then
went
back
into
the
vehicle
and
on
the
back
seat
there
were
lying
five
jackets.
he
picked
up
the
jacket
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
he
took
ahold
of
it,
went
through
it,
and
found
cocaine
in
an
unzipped
pocket
as
well
as
a
$20
bill
and
cocaine
in
a
zippered
pocket.
not
that
that
makes
any
difference.
and
he
then
asked
each
of
the
four
defendants,
at
this
point,
occupants
of
that
vehicle,
as
to
who
owned
this
particular
jacket.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
were
only
four
people
in
the
car,
your
honor,
but
there...
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
what
the...
as
i
recall
the
record.
and
none
of
these--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--yes,
your
honor.
none
of
the
occupants
admitted
to
this
jacket
belonging
to
them.
so
he
then
placed
each
and
everyone
of
the
occupants
under
arrest
for
possession
of
cocaine,
obviously
a
more
serious
offense.
and
the
defendant--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--okay,
your
honor,
in
the
jacket,
in...
the
defendant
in
this
case,
the
respondent,
now
belton...
he
had
an
id
card.
i
believe
it
was
either
a
blue
cross
or
blue
shield
card
with
his
name
on
it.
and
i
handled
the
case
at
the
grand
jury,
and
each
of
the
other
occupants
pointed
the
finger
at
the
respondent
in
this
case,
your
honor.
and
there
was
never
any
disavowal
of
the
ownership
of
that
jacket.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct.
in
the
respondent's
name.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
it's
the
position
of
myself
that
in
this
particular
case
chimel
v.
california
governs
in
that
this
was
a
proper
arrest
and
a
search.
there's
no
question
about
the
lawfulness
of
the
stop,
and
there's
no
question
of
the
leadup
to
the
arrest
for
the
possession
of
marijuana,
that
this
was
a
lawful
stop
and
a
lawful
search
incident
to
arrest.
now,
chimel,
of
course,
pointed
out
you
can
certainly
search
the
arrestee,
in
this-case,
four
arrestees,
and
that
you
can
also
search
the
area
under
the
immediate
control
of
the
arrestees,
and
that
has
been
construed
to
mean
the
area
from
which
an
arrestee
may
gain,
or
might
gain,
access
to
a
weapon
or
destructible
evidence.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
was
alone
at
the
scene.
there
were
no
other
officers
present.
it
was
he
and
the
four
occupants
of
the
motor
vehicle.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
no,
your
honor,
they
were
in
no
way
secured.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
they
were
outside
of
the
vehicle,
outside
of
their
particular
vehicle,
your
honor.
he
did
indicate
that
he,
if
you
will,
he
segregated
them
outside
the
car,
spread
them
out
a
little
bit,
outside
the
vehicle.
that
was
the
extent
as
to
what
he
did.
he
couldn't
secure
because
he
didn't
have
but
one
pair
of
handcuffs.
exactly,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
under
the
chimel
case
that
we
have
to
ask
ourselves,
under
these
circumstances
could
any
one
of
these
arrestees
or
occupants
of
this
vehicle
approach
that
vehicle,
rush
or
overpower
the
officer,
and
of
course
obtain
the
evidence
which
was
on,
in
the
back
seat,
in
the
jackets,
in
this
particular
case?
now,
these
jackets,
we
certainly
can
presume,
were
shed
at
some
point
in
time
by
the
occupants.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
yes.
your
honor,
he
had
to
bend,
push
the
seat
to
get
into
the
back
seat,
push
the
front
seat
forward,
and
bend
in.
at
this
point
in
time
he
was
certainly
indisposed
to
a
certain
extent
in
that
particular
area.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
being
a
two-door
vehicle,
your
honor,
they
could
have
certainly...
my
position
is
more
that
they
could
have
overpowered
the
officer
and
put
him
in
a
situation
where
they
could
have
obtained
the
evidence
and
taken
out
the
jackets
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
believe
that
that's
why
the
search
certainly
is
proper
under
chimel,
because
i
believe
he
could
have
been
overpowered
by
any
one
of
the
arrestees.
this
is
not
a
case
of
one
arrestee--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--okay.
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
below
in
this
particular
case,
took
the
position
that
when
trooper
nicot
placed
these
four
occupants
of
the
vehicle
under
arrest,
that
there
was
some
magic
in
the
officer
with
these
four
occupants
of
the
vehicle,
placed
under
arrest,
that
automatically
they
were
subservient
to
each
and
every
command
of
that
officer
at
the
vehicle.
i
think
that
this
is
quite
frankly
absurd.
i
think,
at
this
point
in
time,
the
exclusive
control,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
of
that
whole
scene...
in
other
words,
now
the
scene
is
stabilized,
as
far
as
the
majority
of
the
court
was
concerned,
once
he
placed
the
individuals
under
arrest
and
of
course
ordered
them
out
of
the
vehicle.
i
think
that's
not
realistic--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--there
was
no
evidence
in
this
particular
case
of
any
weapons.
there
were
no
weapons,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
which
he
never
used,
or
never
even
drew.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
well,
your
honor,
i
maybe
misspoke.
he
certainly
could
have
been.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
he
certainly--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
done;
certainly.
at
some
point
in
time
he
could
have
gone
his
vehicle
and
called
for
help,
under
these
particular
circumstances.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
he's
outside
of
his
vehicle
at
this
point
in
time,
your
honor.
he
could
have
called
initially
when
he
pulled
the
vehicle
over
but--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--that's
very
unusual
in
a
speeding
case,
your
honor,
for
a
police
officer--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
the
law.
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
they
did
that
in
this
particular
case
by
finding
the
exclusive
control
of
the
scene
of
the
jacket
in
the
officer
at
this
point
in
time.
to
me,
that
was
incorrect.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
in
redefining
the
factual
situation,
your
honor,
that
existed
which
they
are
not
supposed
to...
not
authorized
to
do
under
state
law?
i
would
say,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
we're
dealing
here
with
the
constitutionality,
your
honor,
of
the
particular
search.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
i
think,
your
honor,
you
can
examine
the
record
of
the
hearing,
and
i
think
that
that
substantiates
the
position--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
this
court
should
consider
are
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
record
of
the
hearing
in
this
particular
case
at
the
initial
trial
court
below.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
we
don't
have
any,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
now,
in
the
respondent's
brief,
he
makes
much
ado
about
the
lack
of
concern
of
the
officer
for
his
safety.
this
case,
this
court
in
robinson--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--ultimately
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
in
his
vehicle,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
took
them
to
the
police
station,
and
ultimately
to
the
magistrate,
in
that
particular
area,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
in
robinson
stated
that
it's
not
certainly
necessary
for
the
officer
to
calculate
at
the
scene,
to
consider
whether
or
not
a
weapon
may
be
present,
but
rather
the
arrest
itself
automatically
triggers,
if
you
will,
the
search
incident
to
that
arrest,
which
includes
the
area
of
the
arrestee,
as
i
stated
before,
as
well
as
the
person
of
the
arrestee,
in
robinson,
of
course,
it
was
the
person
of
the
arrestee
from
which
the
cigarette
container
was
obtained.
to
say
that
the...
as
i
stated
before...
that
the
officer
had
the
exclusive
control
of
the
jacket
at
the
time
that
he
picked
the
same
up,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
points
out
that
such
a
construction
of
exclusive
control
of
this
standard
would
in
effect
render
chimel
meaningless
in
terms
of
searching
of
portable
items
in
the
area
of
the
particular
arrestee,
as
existed
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
in
which
case,
your
honor?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
in
the
area
of
the
arrestee;
that's
correct.
that
set
forth
the
area
to
be
searched.
i'm
taking
it
certainly
a
step
further,
your
honor,
in
saying
that
the
area
from
which
a
particular
defendant
or
accused
person,
arrestee,
may
obtain
a
weapon
or
contraband,
certainly
should
apply
in
this
particular
case
to
anything
that's
in
that
area
reachable
by
this
defendant
to,
should
we
say,
assault
the
officer
or
destroy
the
evidence.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
could
expect
the
same
argument,
your
honor,
in
the
robinson
case,
once
the
cigarette
container--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--fine,
your
honor.
you
could
certainly
take
that
position
that
once
he
had
ahold
of
it
he
certainly
had
ahold
of
it,
but
the
four
individuals
outside
the
vehicle,
the
occupants,
your
honor,
certainly
could
have
at
that
point
in
time
wrestled...
or
taken
it
from
him.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
incident
to
the
arrest.
we're
still
in
a
fluid
situation
as
the
dissent
in
the
court
below
said
at
this
point.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
there
was
no
clear
view
of
the
cocaine
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
until
the
officer
went
into
the
jacket
and
obtained
the
cocaine,
the
powdery
substance
therefrom.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
an
interesting
question.
i
would
say
at
that
point
in
time,
no.
in
other
words--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
fine.
at
that
point
in
time
there
would
be
no
authority
to
search.
now,
once
the
marijuana,
of
course,
which
was
kind
of
contemporaneous
to
the--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--the
driver
alone?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
at
that
point
in
time,
probably
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
at
the
point
in
time
where
he
arrested
the
driver
for
driving
while
intoxicated?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
he
could
have
a
right,
anything
that
looked
like
it
may
contain
or
could
contain--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--certainly,
pat
down.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
okay.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
how
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
for
his
protection,
on
any
arrest.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
yes.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
yes.
we're
asking,
your
honors,
if
you
will,
the
court
to
set
down
a
standard
or
guideline,
if
you
will,
in
these
type
of
cases,
that
is,
the
search
incident
to
lawful
arrest
cases.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
different
holdings
in
the
state
courts,
some
commentators
have
looked
at
the
area
of
search
incident
to
lawful
arrest
and
come
forward
with
certain
criteria
that
we
think
ought
to
apply.
that
is...
and
be
considered,
certainly,
by
the
officer
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
as
well
as
by
the
courts.
we
would
like
to
see
this
come
from
this
court
and
the
other
lower
courts.
that
is,
the
number
of
arrestees
as
opposed
to
the
number
of
police
officers
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
what
restraint
if
any
has
been
imposed
upon
the
arrestee
at
the
time
of
the
arrest?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
the
person
as
well
as
anything
within
the
"grabbable"
area
of
the
arrestee,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
of
the
individual,
at
that
time.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
anytime
you've
got
the
custodial
arrest,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
no
question
about
that,
your
honor,
certainly.
and
taking
it
off,
should
another
rule
apply?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
if
he
were
carrying
it
in
his
hand,
clearly,
it
would
have
been
searchable
under
robinson.
if
he
were
seated
at
a
park
bench
and
arrested
for
a
crime
that
were
two
feet
from
the
particular
individual,
i
take
the
position
that
will
also
be,
if
you
would,
your
honor,
certainly
searchable.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
any
point
in
time
at
the
arrest;
i
agree
with
your
honor.
certainly.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
no.
the
area.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
your
honor,
is
the
position
that
i
take.
the
area
of
the
arrestee.
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
facts
in
this
case,
all
the
individuals,
not
just
the
driver,
were
of
course
under
arrest.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
location...
another
criteria...
the
location
of
the
arrestees
in
relation
to
the
automobile
and
the
ease
or
difficulty
to
be
encountered
by
the
arrestees
in
gaining
access
again
to
the
weapon
or
the
destructible
evidence,
the
area,
if
you
will,
of
the
arrest.
and
we
believe
that
we're
not
looking
for
any
particular
rigid
or
inflexible
guidelines
by
this
court,
but
rather
to
look
at
each
case
where
there
is
a
search
without
a
warrant
under
a
recognized
rule
such
as
the
search
incident
to
lawful
arrest,
which
we
believe
is
here,
that
we
should
have
some
guidelines
for
the
courts
below--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--i
think
we
should
go,
in
the
area,
i
think...
justice
stewart
had
a
good
point.
in
terms
of...
the
officer
is
the
person
that's
going
to
have
to
make
the
determination
at
the
scene.
we
certainly
should
give
him
through
the
courts
and
through
the
education
process
as
much
of
the
criteria,
as
many
guidelines
as
possible,
so
that
he
can
do
this
job
properly.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
it's
got
to,
your
honor,
apply;
the
circumstances
certainly
govern
what's
reasonable.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that'
correct,
your
honor.
we're
interweaving,
certainly,
the
two
circumstances,
the
two
cases.
one,
of
course,
chimel,
is
aimed
at
primarily
the
obtaining
of
the
weapon
or
the
destructible
evidence.
the
other
is
the,
certainly
the
custodial
arrest
and
the
search
incident
to
it.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
for
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
robbins.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
in
the
trunk,
your
honor,
or
in
the?
mr.
james
r.
harvey
not
at
that
point,
no,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
whole
new
criterion.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
yes.
our
position
is,
in
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
you
never
get
to
the
point
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
because
of
the
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
taking
that
chimel,
certainly,
a
step
further.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
right.
in
my
particular...
it's
our
position
it
doesn't,
but
it
certainly
was
unzipped
but
it
was
not
visible
as
a
white
powder
substance
without
going
into
the
jacket;
certainly,
your
honor.
now,
in
the
respondent's
brief,
he
relies
heavily
on
chadwick--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
as
a
search
incident
to
lawful
arrest,
under
those
circumstances,
custodial
arrest
at
that
point
in
time,
that
the
officer
to
protect
himself
and
destructible
evidence
has
the
duty
and
the
right,
certainly,
to
search
this
particular
area
of
the
arrestee.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
if
it
includes
someone
else
other
than
is
in
there,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
that's
correct,
your
honor;
yes,
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
that
same
jacket.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
there's
no
question
about
that,
who
owned
the
jacket,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
on
the
outside
of
the
jacket;
correct,
your
honor.
the
respondent
relies
heavily
on
chadwick
and
sanders
in
this
particular
brief.
i
believe
these
cases
certainly
were
rightly
decided,
properly
decided.
i
think
that
chadwick
clearly...
the
police
officers
had
exclusive
control
of
the
200
pound
trunk
some
one
hour
and
a
half
after
they'd
arrested
the
defendants
or
taken
them
to
the
police
station.
and
i
believe
in
sanders
the
search
incident
argument
was
never
made
under
those
particular
circumstances
and
clearly
these
two
cases
are
distinguishable.
it's
our
position,
your
honors,
that
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
conviction
reinstated
on
the
theory
that
this
was
in
all
respects
a
proper
search
incident
to
lawful
arrest.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
since
i
still
have
a
couple
minutes,
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court:
the
only
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
chimel
criteria
as
set
forth
by
the
court
defines
the
area
as
the
area
that
the
arrestee
might
reach
in
order
to
grab
a
weapon
or
evidentiary
material.
and
i
think
that's
here,
certainly,
in
this
case
on
the
record
on
certainly
one
of
two
theories.
either
the
overpowering
theory,
and
i
think
quite
frankly
that's
the
theory
that's
here
clearly
on
the
record
below--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--my
position,
your
honor,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
you've
got
four
individuals
exiting
the
vehicle,
all
being
placed
under
arrest
for
possession
of
marijuana,
that
anything--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--if
it
were
within
the
area
of
gaining
access
by
any
of
these
arrestees,
your
honor,
then
it
should
be
subject
to--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--a
briefcase
that
could
be
gotten
into,
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
well,
your
honor,
also
they
could
have
reached
in
through
the...
that
it's
tied
in.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
i
think
that's
certainly
the
criteria,
and
the
area
that's
being
searched,
in
this
case
the
inside
of
an
automobile,
your
honor,
that
is,
on
the
back
seat
of
the--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--the
facts
of
this
case;
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
you're
getting
into
a
different
factual
situation.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
you're
certainly
in
the
car
looking
through
the
vehicle
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
harvey
in
fact--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--in
fact,
the--
mr.
james
r.
harvey
--in
fact,
the
officer
was
not
overpowered
in
this
particular
case,
but
he
certainly,
under
the
chimel-robinson
rules
had
the
opportunity
and
the
right
to
search
the
interior
of
those
jackets,
your
honor.
thank
you.
