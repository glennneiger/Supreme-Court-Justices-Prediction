mr.
cambria,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
this
jacket
had
been
on
the
seat
beside
the
driver,
it
would
have
been
reachable
before
the
driver
got
out
of
the
car.
under
the
right
to
search
incident
to
arrest,
if
the
driver
was
still
sitting
at
the
steering
wheel
the
officer
i
take
it
could
then
have
searched
the
jacket,
if
it
lay
on
the
seat
beside
him.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know.
but
my
question
assumed
he
was--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--so
that
the
difference
really
is
whether
or
not
the
officer
asked
for
the
jacket
before
or
after
the
driver
stepped
out
of
the
car?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
not
draw
any
distinction
between
a
residence,
a
home,
and
an
automobile?
