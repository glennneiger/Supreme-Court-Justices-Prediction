mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
with
what
i
think
is
a
critical
point.
chief
judge
cooke,
below,
for
the
court
of
appeals,
very
clearly
pointed
but
that
at
no
time,
at
any
time
in
this
record
was
there
proof
that
there
materials
were
within
the
grabbable
reach
of
these
individuals.
there
was
never
a
finding
to
that
effect
by
the
trial
court,
there
was
never
a
finding
to
that
effect
by
the
appellate
division--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
after
they
get
out
of
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
started
off
and
the
sequence
of
events
were
as
indicated
by
mr.
harvey
except
for
one
thing
left
out.
they
were
taken
out
and
first
patted
down.
the
officer
then
went
back
into
the
car
and
discovered
a
small
quantity
of
marijuana.
then
he
went
out
and
thoroughly
searched
them
and
spread
them
out,
and
he
said,
at
the
back
of
the
car.
he
then
went
into
the
car
and
patted
the
jacket
down
first,
and
indicated
that
he
felt
nothing
that
would
indicate
a
weapon
at
all.
and
the
point
made
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
i
think
has
to
be
emphasized,
is
that
the
record
simply
does
not
support
a
chimel
exception
which
it
is
certainly
the
burden
of
the
petitioners
to
support
from
the
record.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
in
fact,
they
were
outside
the
car--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes,
and
that's
the
proof.
that
was
conceded
here,
that
they
were
outside
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
does
not
apply
under
chimel.
if
i
might,
chimel
indicated
that
it's
not
everything
in
a
room,
to
use
justice
stewart's
language,
not
everything
in
a
room
which
would
be
subject
to
search,
only
those
things
in
the
examples
used
were,
perhaps,
a
gun
in
front
of
the
individual;
perhaps
a
drawer
in
front
of
the
individual;
but
certainly
not
the
entire
room.
that
was
the
rabinowitz
standard,
which
was
rejected
by
this
court
12
years
ago
in
chimel.
and
that's
the
point
that
happens
here.
we
have
to
bear
deference
to
the
officer's
description
of
the
event
and
to
the
ringside
seat
that
he
had
of
the
event,
where
he
indicates
that
there
was
no
reason
for
him
whatsoever
to
draw
his
gun;
he
felt
absolutely
no
danger
to
himself,
which
is
one
of
the
twin
prongs
of
chimel.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
might
indicate
that
when
the
question
was
asked
of
him
he
was
quick
to
respond,
as
the
record
shows,
there
was
just
no
need
for
that
at
any
time.
he
had
certainly
separated
them,
as
he
indicated,
he
had
patted
them
down,
he
had
searched
them
totally,
and
then
he
went
back
into
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
we
have
to
deal
with
the
record
the
way
it
exists.
and
under
the
record
the
way
it
exists
the
car
acted
as
a
barrier
between
these
individuals
and
the
jacket
which
was
on
the
back
seat
at
the
time,
and
not
as
an
open
area.
for
example,
it's
not
even
as
good
as
being
in
the
open
room
described
in
chimel,
where
the
court
said
you
couldn't
search
all
of
the
various
drawers.
it's
better,
in
this
situation,
because
the
cubicle
in
which
the
officer
was
is
different
than
where
the
individuals
were
standing.
there
was,
in
fact,
a
barrier
created
here,
and
to
demonstrate--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
only
thing
we
could
do
is
hypothesize
that
that
perhaps
could
be
possible.
if
we
were
to
do
that,
i
respectfully
submit,
justice
rehnquist,
there
would
never
be
a
chimel
exception,
because
in
every
set
of
circumstances
we
could
say,
under
some
conceivable
set
of
facts
someone
would
be
able
to
go
into,
let's
say,
the
entire
room.
or
if
it
were
in
one
room
of
the
house,
maybe
all
the
other
rooms,
they
could
bolt
out
the
door
and
go
into
the
other
rooms.
so
therefore
we
ought
to
be
able
to
search
all
of
the
rooms
in
the
house.
i
don't
think
we've
ever
had
that.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
that's
true.
that
would
be
a
factor
for
consideration.
but
if
i
might,
if
we
were
to
decide--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--he
indicated
that
he
had
no
reason
for
it.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
but
i
think
that
the
point
is,
if
we
were
to
decide
the
strength
or
the
weakness
of
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
based
upon
the
number
of
officers,
or
the
number
of
weapons,
or
the
number
of
handcuffs,
then
an
officer
without
any
weapons,
without
any
handcuffs,
all
alone,
would
be
able
to
do
much
more
searching
without
a
warrant
than
an
officer
who
was
armed
with
a
shotgun,
or
two
officers--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--the
only
thing
indicated,
your
honor,
was
that
they
were
on
their
way
home
to
buffalo,
and
they
were
at
all
times
cooperative
with
the
officer.
there's
nothing
else
biographical
about
them.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
they
were
all
young
men
and
that
was
revealed
in
the
record,
that
they
were
young
men.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
not
revealed
in
the
record.
in
fact,
they
were,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
the
point
that
i
think
again,
the
appellate
division
here,
and,
i
submit,
the
government
is
attempting
to
say
by
citing
adams
v.
williams
and
the
other
cases,
that
we
should
scrap
chimel,
that
we
should
adopt
the
robinson
standard
for
the
area,
as
opposed
to
what
it
stands
for
which
is
the
person.
robinson
says
that
we
find
that
the
arrest
itself
is
enough
of
an
intrusion
so
that
those
matters
immediately
associated
with
the
body
are
subsumed
in
the
invasion
of
privacy.
but
that's
not--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
believe
that
the
officer
could
open
the
glove
compartment.
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--well,
because
i
believe
that
under
south
dakota
v.
opperman
and
the
other
cases
around
the
car
exception,
that
those
areas
traditionally
do
not
enjoy
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
private
receptacles
do.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
opperman.
so
that
if
we're
talking
about,
specifically,
opperman,
the
glove
compartment
or
the
trunk
or
the
common
areas
of
the
car,
the
car,
since
it's
highly
regulated,
since
it
is
an
area
with
windows
and
so
on,
does
not
enjoy
the
same
expectation
of
privacy
as
their
private
garments.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
if
we
then
go
to
inventory,
we're
talking
of
something
other
than
the
fourth
amendment.
we're
talking
of
something
that
certainly
wasn't
done
here,
and
something
that
under
opperman
could
be
done.
the
question
would
then
be,
how
far
could
you
go
with
the
inventory?
would
it
be
enough
to
simply
list
the
jacket
without
going
into
the
pocket?
each
pocket
was
zippered.
the
testimony
is,
one
was
in
fact
closed.
they
were
all
closed.
the
testimony
was
one
was
zippered
and
had
to
be
opened.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
if
they
would,
and
it
would
depend
upon--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--my
recollection
of
opperman
is
that
it
depends
upon
their
local
rules
and
regulations
as
to
what
they
can
do
and
what
they
can't
do
in
the
inventory
situation.
now,
in
this
case,
i
think
that
it
bears
emphasis
that
the
officer
did
exactly
what
this
court
indicated
in
sanders
and
in
chadwick
should
be
done,
and
that
is,
he
took
the
jacket
with
him.
he
stated
clearly,
i
had
it
in
my
possession.
this
was
after
the
arrest.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that
was
the
claim
that
was
first
made--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
would
say
that
probable
cause
wouldn't
make
the
difference
as
it
did
not
in
sanders.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no
question
about
that,
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
probable
cause
for
this
specific
jacket.
that
would
be
the
argument
made.
but
even
if
there
were,
assuming
arguendo
were
the
same
as
sanders,
it
was
considered
by
this
court
in
the
footnote,
as
indicated
to
be
dicta
by
the
government,
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
individuals
in
sanders
were
there
in
close
proximity
to
this
unlocked
attache
case,
and
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
with
regard
to
that
case.
but
it
wasn't
made.
and
i
submit
it
wasn't
made
because
it
wasn't
supported
by
the
record
in
that
case.
like
in
this
case,
there
is
absolutely
no
pronouncement
at
all
that
these
materials
were
within
the
grabbable
reach
of
these
individuals.
if
we
try
to
uphold
this
on
adams
v.
williams,
which
i
think
is
totally
irrelevant
to
this
consideration
for
this
reason:
in
adams
v.
williams
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe,
as
a
result
of
a
reliable
tip,
that
there
is
an
armed
and
dangerous
individual
seated
in
an
automobile,
and
the
officer
approaches
the
individual,
asks
him
to
get
out;
he
doesn't
get
out,
he
rolls
the
window
down.
the
officer
reaches
in,
pats
in
the
area,
and
finds
a
weapon...
immediately
finds
a
weapon.
then
he
takes
him
out
and
searches...
no
containers...
searches
the
common
areas
of
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
not
under
the...
no,
for
two
reasons;
no.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
the
difference
is
that
in
adams
v.
williams
the
gun
is
immediately--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--associated
with
the
person.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
in
our
case,
at
no
time...
and
that's
why
there's
been
an
allusion
to
the
draper
standard;
draper
is
different.
there
the
piece
searched
was
immediately
associated
with
the
individual's
taking
from
it.
and
another
day,
i'm
sure--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that
question,
which
certainly
is
not
here
at
this
point--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
i
understand
that.
i
would
say
this.
first
of
all--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes...
in
my
argument
it
was
never
taken
from
any
of
the
defendants.
he
had
it
in
his
hand
without
the
defendants'
presence.
they
were
outside
the
car.
it
was
never
taken
from
any
of
the
defendants
after
the
time
of
the
arrest.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
separated--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
would
say
this,
that
he
could
not
do
that
if
he's--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
would
submit
this,
that
draper
may
be
qualified
by
chadwick
and
sanders;
it
may
be,
because
of
the--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
as
to
my
case,
yes.
they
were
not
in
the
draper
situation
in
my
case.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
was
trying
to
answer
the
hypothetical--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no.
i
think
that
my
argument
does
not
have
a
key
draper
ingredient
which
i
believe--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no,
because
i
think
in
this
case
the
court
below,
the
decision
below
was,
that
at
no
time
were
these
materials
within
the
chimel
standard.
they
talk
of
chimel,
talk
about
chimel,
and
specifically
distinguish
their
decision
from
a
case
called
people
v.
desantis.
people
v.
desantis
was
a
draper
case
where
a
briefcase
was
in
the
hand
of
an
individual
and
taken
from
him
at
that
time.
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
quite
clear,
below,
we
are
not
talking
about
that,
we
are
talking
about
the
facts
before
us,
which
are
that
there's
never
any
immediate
association
between
the
jackets
and
the
individuals
after
the
arrests,
so--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
suggest
in
my
case
there's
no
need
to
depart
from
draper
because
the
facts
are
not
there.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
chadwick,
now,
and
sanders--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
think
that
that--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no.
the
difference
in
draper
is
that
they
had
probable
cause
there
for
the
particular
item
involved.
they
were
told
ahead
of
time
that
this
briefcase
that
draper
was
carrying
was
where
the
narcotics
were,
and
there
was
a
specific
situation
and
probable
cause
which
we
don't
even
have
here.
assuming
we
did,
that
would
be
draper,
except
there's
one
other
fact
in
our
case
that's
not
present
in
draper--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--with
regard
to
draper?
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
the
difference
is
this.
in
this
case
there
is
no
draper
fact.
we
don't
have
it
in
the
hands
of
the
individuals.
and
that's
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
for
the
arrest
for
speeding?
no.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
not
for
the
arrest
for
the
marijuana.
as
to
the
interior
of
the
car,
not
for
the
packages
in
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that's...
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
and
i
think
that
it
is.
it
falls
into
two
categories.
as
to
the
petitioners,
it
falls
into
whether
or
not
it
comes
within
chimel,
which
is
grabbable
reach.
as
to
the
government,
it
falls
within
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
expand
robinson
and
in
effect
subsume
chimel
by
saying,
as
long
as
you're
arrested,
the
police
have
the
right
to
search
the
area,
whether
or
not
the
materials
in
the
area
are
within
the
grabbable
reach
of
the
individual.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
it
said--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--no.
the
emphasis,
i
believe,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
was
the
area
immediately
associated
with
the
arrestee
into
which
he
could
reach.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
there
wasn't...
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
mention
of
plain
view.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
i
might
indicate
that
in
chimel
the
opinion
covered
closed
drawers,
open
drawers;
plain
view,
not
in
plain
view;
many
areas.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
government's
side
of
this,
we
would
be
extinguishing
chimel,
because
we
wouldn't
have
to
concern
ourselves
anymore
with
whether
or
not
there
was
a
grabbable
reach
problem;
we
would
simply
say,
in
the
vein
of
robinson,
are
you
arrested?
does
that
in
fact
cause
a
breach
of
your
privacy?
if
so,
is
it
just
incidental
to
search
the
matters
around
you?
that
was
what
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
because
that
was
the
finding
of
the
appellate
division
here.
there
has
never
been
a
finding
that
these
materials
came
within
the
chimel
grabbable
reach.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--yes,
it
was
never
argued
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
at
all
here;
no,
not
in
this
particular--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--that's
true.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes,
and
i--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
we
should
not...
and
the
court
has
not,
in
the
past...
adopted
a
place
or
area
requirement,
but
has
in
fact
employed
this
grabbable
reach
element.
and
if
we
take
the
precedent
of
this
court
simply
from
the
chimel
standpoint,
it's
not
only
not
established
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
it's
not
even
remotely
established
by
the
facts
in
this
case,
since,
as
indicated,
the
officer
did
something
that
would
show
that
by
following
the
procedure
here,
he's
certainly
not
deprived
of
any
law
enforcement
activity,
because
he
in
fact
took
the
jacket
with
him;
had
the
people
to
such
a
degree
of
control
that
they
first
stopped
at
the
police
barracks,
then
they
went
on
to
the
court;
the
same
individuals
are
with
him.
he
had
it,
as
he
said,
in
his
possession
and
secured.
so
we're
not
in
any
way
attempting
to
frustrate
law
enforcement.
we're
simply
saying
when
you're
not
within
the
chimel
confines,
then
you
have
it
in
your
possession;
take
it
to
a
magistrate.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
and
i
think
that
that
is
true
unless
we
were
to
attempt
to
argue
the
government's
version,
which
is,
forget
about
chimel.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes,
sir,
justice
powell.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
at
the
time
of
arrest
the
occupant
was
outside
of
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
if
it
was
within
his
grabbable
reach,
under
chimel,
i
think
that
i
would
be
foolish
to
argue
otherwise.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
difference.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
at
the
time
the
people
were
placed
under
arrest
and
again,
recognizing
the
two
bases
for
chimel,
was
there
a
basis
for
believing
destruction
of
evidence
or
a
danger
to
the
officer?
and
was
that
manifested
by
the
jacket
being
within
the
grabbable
reach
of
the
arrestee?
that
was
the
actual
issue.
because
the
court
has
never
said
that
for
any
type
of
arrest,
when
it's
not
within
the
chimel
reach,
that
you
can
simply
search
the
entire
area,
search
all
of
the
possessions,
or
even
the
car,
for
that
matter.
so
what
i'm
indicating
is,
the
critical
time,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
and
most
recently
in
sanders
is
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
at
the
time
of
the
search;
that's
when
we
measure
the
facts.
and
as
i'm
indicating,
here
when
we
measure
the
facts,
as
the
court
below
obviously
interpreted
the
record...
and
the
record
itself
is
clear,
the
state
has
not
carried
their
burden.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
articles
within
an
automobile
and
articles
in
a
residence,
or
articles
anywhere
else,
if
they
are
private
receptacles,
and
i
don't
think
there's
much
argument
here
that
these
are
not,
then
the
question
is,
as
it
was
in
sanders
and
the
other
cases,
that
we
don't
give
up
the
privacy
simply
because
they
happened
to
be
in
an
automobile
or
because
they're
somewhere
else.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
edwards
and
this
case,
because
in
mr.
edwards'
situation
we're
talking
about
his
clothes,
which
were
totally
immediately
associated
with
him
because
he
was
wearing
them.
there
was,
therefore,
a
great
jeopardy
that
the
paint
flakes
which
were
on
the
clothes
could
have
been
destroyed
by
him,
which
was
the
very
evidence
that
they
were
attempting
to
preserve
in
the
case.
so
there
was
a
vast
difference
between
this
case
and
that
case.
in
that
case,
if
we
take
one
of
the
two
forks
of
chimel,
which
is
preservation
of
evidence
immediately
associated
with
the
person,
edwards
falls
directly
within
that.
if
we
take
my
case,
where
the
material
is
immediately
associated
with
the
police
officer
and
at
no
time
after
the
arrest
and
search
associated
with
my
client,
then
we
have
none
of
the
two-pronged
basis
for
chimel.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
temporal
difference
in
edwards
since,
one
is
he
was
wearing
the
garment,
it
was
always
in
danger
of
having
whatever
evidence
was
contained
on
it
being
destroyed.
so
it
was
a
contemporaneous
search,
no
matter
what
had
happened,
until
you
separated
the
individual
from
the
clothing.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
it
would
make
a
difference
under
preston,
certainly.
that
would
be
an
additional
factor,
one
that's
not
involved
here
but
one
that
was
involved
in
preston,
which
was
also
involved
in
edwards.
i
mean,
i
would
say
that
that
is
another
ground
upon
which
to
invalidate
a
search
and
seizure,
if
there's
a
temporal
variation,
difference;
which
we
don't
have.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
it
did
not
invalidate
it,
and
i
submit,
because
of
several
unique
factors.
one
was,
apparently
they
didn't
have
any
clothes
for
the
man
until
sometime...
it
was
late
at
night,
and
they
had
taken
him
down
to
the
cell;
that
was
their
normal
procedure
to
do
that.
and
again,
the
evidence
was
apparently
clinging
to
his
very
outer
garments
at
all
times,
and
they...
at
least
the
way
i
read
that
case...
acted
as
quickly
as
possible
under
the
circumstances.
so
the
time
was
really
not
a
factor
because
it
was
a
constant
jeopardy,
whereas,
certainly,
here
there
is
nothing
like
that
at
all.
as
we
have
indicated,
maybe
with
regard
to
these
facts
the
officer
had
the
jacket,
readily
admitted
it,
at
all
times.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
grabbable
reach,
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
reach
the
materials,
that's
the
way
i
interpret
chimel;
readily
reach
the
materials
immediately.
the
words
are
used,
immediately,
ready
at
reach,
ready
to
hand,
are
some
of
the
other
words
that
have
been
used,
which
i
think
is
much
different
than
this
situation,
but
there's
never
been
a
claim,
by
proof,
that
any
of
this
was
ready
to
hand,
at
any
time.
and
of
course,
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
saw
it
below,
and
it
is
my
contention
that
based
upon
the
record
that
we
have
here,
not
very...
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think
that
the
record
certainly
shows
in
all
ways
and
fashions
that
it
was
not,
and
there
is
no
affirmative
proof
that
it
was.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
never.
there
was
never
any
findings
in
this
case
that
it
was
within
the
grabbable
reach.
it
was
never
mentioned
at
one
time
by
any
court
that
it
was
within
the
grabbable
reach.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
well,
i
think
that...
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
particular
case
you
couldn't
make
a
judgment
of
fact,
that
the
court
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
judgment
of
fact
as
opposed
to
a
judgment
of
law
based
upon
the
record
as
found
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
did.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
the
opinion
was
to
the
effect
that
in
the
last
footnote
of
the
chief
judge's
opinion
he
said,
we
search
the
record
in
vain
in
an
attempt
to
find
the
facts
which
support,
the
dissenting
justice
is
gabrielli,
his
statement
that
this
was
ready
to
hand
or
within
their
reach.
it
isn't
there;
nowhere.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
i
think
that
when
it
appears
in
a
majority
opinion
and
they...
as
perhaps
this
court
in
its
majority
opinion
in
talking
of
certain
things
mentioned
in
dissents,
when
you
say,
we
have
in
essence
construed
the
record
and
we
find
no
proof
whatsoever
that
this
is
within
the
grabbable
reach,
i
think
that's
a
finding
of
fact.
because
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
would
have
found
to
the
contrary,
then
i
feel
they
would
have
been
bound
by
chimel,
and
they
have
discussed
chimel,
clearly,
and
said
that
it
simply
did
not
come
within
the
confine
of
chimel.
i
think
it
is
most
certainly
a
finding
of
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
and
then
only
as
to
those
items
listed
by
this
court
in
opperman,
which
would
be
items
immediately
associated
with
a
car:
trunk,
glove
compartment,
wheel
wells,
fender
wells,
and
so
on.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there
has
to
be
a
pleading
situation,
plus
there
has
to
be
the
limited
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
the
areas
being
searched,
and
certainly
not
packages
which
are
within
the
car
itself.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
the
only
testimony
here
is
that
he
took
the
individuals
out
to
the
rear
of
the
car,
that
he
first
split
them
up
and
patted
them
all
down.
he
went
back
into
the
car,
found
some
minor--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--he,
i
believe,
indicated
the
driver's
door.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
then
he
came
back
out--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--however,
the
record
doesn't
support
that.
the
record
has
them
at
the
back
of
the
vehicle
and
in
no
way
supports
going
into
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no
way...
in
fact,
the
officer
puts
himself
back
into
the
car.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that's
so.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that's
what
the
record
states,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
think,
in
this
case,
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
can
be
read
to
say,
since
it
was
in
the
exclusive
control
of
the
officer
and
it
was
not
within
the
grabbable
reach
of
the
defendants,
then
it
doesn't
fit
within
the
chimel
doctrine.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
that
footnote
stands
for,
by
saying,
we
have
it
in
the
police
officer's
possession
which,
under
chadwick
and
sanders,
he
should
therefore
take
it
down
to
and
have
the
magistrate
examine
it.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that
established
a
control...
if
there
would
have
been
testimony
in
this
case
that
the
material
was
within
the
grabbable
reach
of
the
individuals,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
of
the
officer.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
see
this...
i
see
no
reason
to
defend
it
on
this
record.
i
believe
that
it
could
be
defended
under
chadwick
and
sanders,
but
i
do
not
see
the
reason
to
do
it
here.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
was
discussed.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
unlocked,
but
it
was
in
a
trunk
and
the
trunk
was
opened
and
the
individuals
were
outside.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
it
was
not
within
the
chimel
reach;
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it
does
not...
they
did
not,
they
do
and
they
don't...
they
do
from
the
standpoint
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
consideration
which
was
available,
it
certainly
gave
pause
to
this
court--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--i
submit
that
it
wasn't
made
because
it
wasn't
a
valid
argument
to
be
made.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
that
it
was
not
a
valid
argument.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
we
are
in
a
better
position
than
that
case.
there
we
have
the
arrestees
standing
by
the
trunk
at
the
time,
two
of
them,
and
this
unlocked
briefcase
is
pulled
out
of
an
open
trunk,
at
that
time.
my
case
is
entirely
different
than
that.
we
have
people
outside
and
he's
inside,
and
so
on.
and
so
that's
why.
but
i
say
this,
sanders
and
chadwick
are
involved
to
the
degree
that
we
have
to
deal
with
the
government's
argument
which
is,
just
the
arrest
alone
gives
you
the
area
or
the
zone
of
search.
i
say
it
does
not
because
under
chadwick
and
sanders
we
have
a
privacy
expectation
in
these
articles.
the
petitioner's
case,
of
course,
deals
with
chimel
squarely.
and
as
i've
indicated,
the
record
does
not
support
their
claim
at
all.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
raised,
and
it
finds
no
support
in
the
record.
one
of
the
clarifications
i
might
make
is
that
it
was
after
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
cocaine
that
the
officer
then
said,
whose
jacket
is
this?
and
that's
when
there
was
a
disclaimer.
but
he
had
already
conducted
his
search
prior
to
the
time
he
elicited--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--search
of
the
jacket
itself.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
then,
later
on,
of
course,
there's
a
direct
claim
of
ownership.
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
the
back,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
no,
there
was
no
statement.
in
the
robbins
case
there
was
a
statement
made
about--
mr.
paul
j.
cambria,
jr.
--nothing
at
all
in
this
case.
at
all.
nothing
at
all.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
