mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court:
my
name
is
salvatore
cucinotta,
and
i
am
really
counsel
for
the
defense.
i
have
not
been
planted
here
by
the
government
because
if
that
really
did
occur,
if
the
government
attempts
were
successful,
then
i
wouldn't
be
here.
and
to
a
very
large
degree,
there
would
be
no
other
adversary
system
like
we
have
now.
i
am
here
in
a
sense,
not
only
representing
hazel
morrison,
i
am
representing
the
adversary
system
of
which
we
all
are
members.
to
allow
this
behavior
to
go
unchecked
when
there
are
known
attempts
permits
the
government
to
do
away
with
their
adversary.
in
the
trial
courtroom,
to
that
extent,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment;
of
course,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
the
$4500
is...
was
a
settlement,
your
honor,
but
how
can
that
pay
for
selling
the
adversary
system
or
avoiding
the
adversary
system?
does
that
not
allow
the
government
to
make
purchases
for
heroin
and
then
use
a
little
more
money
to
pay
the
individual
for
the
attempt
of
avoiding
the
adversary
system,
all
they're
going
to
do
is
ask
for
more
funds
to
do
away
with
trials.
if
they
are
allowed
to
pay
when
they
get
caught.
no,
you
are
in
a
situation
that
is
kind
of
like
mapp
v.
ohio.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
well--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
thought
that
the
remedy
as
far
as
the
system
was
concerned,
and
as
far
as
hazel
was
concerned,
was
the
dismissal
of
the
prosecution
and
also,
together
with
that
dismissal,
it
was
an
additional
remedy.
it
was
not
an
either/or,
because
if
it
becomes
neither/nor
then
we
have
the...
a
mockery
of
justice,
to
a
very
large
extent.
as
i
said,
you
will
allow
the
government
to
make
these
attempts...
if
they
are
successful
we
will
never
know
about
it;
you'll
have
litigants
passing
in
front
of
trial
judges,
and
he'll
never
know
who
represents
which
side.
but
now,
when
we've
discovered--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--and--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--well
you
know,
the
government
agents,
although
the
factual
rendition
was
given
to
you
by--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--i
don't
agree
with
that
as
the
facts.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
i
don't
agree
with
that
as
the
facts.
those
are
not
the
facts.
she
was
only
told
she
could
get
a
public
defender
after
she
cooperated
with
the
government.
so
she
really
was
asking
for
her
attorney
to
be
present,
and
she
was
told
by
the
government
agents
that
it
was
only
them
and
not
her
attorney
or
any
attorney
who
could
help
them
get
through
that
s.o.b.
in
federal
court
who
hates
black
people.
it
was
the
government
agents
and
not
through
her
right
to
counsel,
and
when
she
asked
for
her
right
to
counsel,
she
was
told
that
she
would
face
a
harsher
jail
sentence
and
she
stood
with
five
years
as
the
first
conviction.
to
this
day,
hazel
morrison
and
the
public,
more
importantly,
does
not
know
whether
or
not
indeed
the
agents
really
were
successful
in
their
threat.
and
that
is
the
analysis
which--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--if
the
worst
would
have
happened,
is
exemplified,
is
lying...
you'd
have
to
go
on
and
imagine...
use
your
imagination,
as
exemplified
in
cases
like
people
v.
moore
and
people
v.
mora,
out
of
california.
there
it
was
found,
a
reported
situation
where
an
individual
went
along
with
the
government
overtures,
dismissed
his
counsel
and
wound
up
not
getting
the
kind
of
relief...
because
the
bargain
that
he
struck
he
could
not
enforce.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
in
terms
of--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--in
terms
of
prejudice,
my
relationship
with
my
client
was--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--in
this
particular
trial,
your
honor,
i
can't
speculate
because
i
can't
get
involved
in
nice
calculations
as
we
said
in
glasser.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
there
is
a
taint--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--if
you're
referring
to
the
government's
argument
regarding
the
lack
of
prejudice--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
to
rely
on
the...
on
the
confidentiality
of
our
communications,
to
not--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--not
have
the
fee
understanding
between
us
known
to
the
government--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--to
the
extent--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--all
of
these
things,
i
cannot
speculate--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--she
pleaded...
she
pled
guilty
because
when
the
government
did
this
and
went
along
and
attempted
to
decimate
this
attorney-client
relationship--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--no,
they
didn't.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
they
didn't
succeed.
because
if
they
succeeded,
i
would
not
be
here.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
the
$4500
was
an
additional
remedy,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
hazel
morrison's
right
to
an
adversary,
due
process
hearing
is
worth
$4500.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
oh
yes,
your
honor,
i've
been
intimidated
for
several
years,
in
a
sense.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
in
this
case.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
in
this
case,
because
you
never
know
which
way--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--all
i
have
to
do,
your
honor,
is
read
that
they
can
come
into
court
with
search
warrants
and
accuse
me
of
criminal
activity,
tell
me
to
go
get
a
lawyer,
in
a
adversary
proceeding--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--that
was
this
case,
judge.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
it
sure
did,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
when
i
have
a
federal
court
which
i
respect
telling
me,
threatening
me
with
possible
contempt
and
disciplinary
action--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--because
all
i
was
trying
to
do
was
prove
the
truth,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
no,
your
honor,
but
i--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
your
honor,
i
believe
that
once
you
find
the
government
involved
in
this
kind
of
activity,
which
is
the
most
egregious
kind
of
record
that
this
court
has
ever
seen,
is
not
lying
on
search
warrants,
it
is
not
lying
to
the
grand
jury,
it
is
not...
and
in
fact,
you've
got
some
lies
in
this
particular
case.
you've
got
them
lying
on
the
search
warrant,
you've
got
them
lying
at
least
on
three
occasions
in
their
answer
to
my
motion
to
dismiss,
when
they
said
oh
no,
we
didn't
discuss
counsel's
effectiveness
and
we
didn't
tell
her
anything
about
a
sentence,
et
cetera.
and
then
they
came
into
court
and
they
really
hedged
and
hawed,
until
finally
they
realized
that
possibly
they
had
to
tell
the
truth.
they
had
to
tell
the
truth
about
an
attempt
to
decimate,
an
attempt
to
terminate
an
individuals'
right
to
counsel,
and
in
that
sense,
we're
talking
about
terminating
all
of
our
right
to
counsel,
because
if
you
let
it
go
here
then
nothing's
going
to
stop
them,
as
far
as
a
going
on
to
the
next
case
and
the
next
case
after
that.
and...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
society
has
a
greater
interest
in
protecting
their
own
right
to
counsel.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
yes,
i
agree
with
the
court.
and
i'm--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
justice
rehnquist
that
the
interest
of
each
of
one
us
is
what
the
lower
court
and
all
the
judges
down
there
were
seeking
to
protect.
they
weren't
really
interested
in
the
fact
that
my
client
pled
guilty
or
did
it,
or
didn't
do
it.
that
wasn't
really
as
important
as
the
fact
that
you
have
to
protect
society's
interest
to
make
sure
that
this
activity
doesn't
occur
30
again.
to
say
that
a
civil
remedy
that
has
been
argued
in
briefs
by
the
government,
would
be
some
sort
of
alternative
relief,
i
wish
it
would
be
that
easy.
because
i'm
asking
for
some
real
drastic
relief.
but
it's
not
really
that
easy,
because
civil
remedies
lead...
first
of
all,
they
allow
it
to
occur,
they
say...
set
forth,
as
i
said
earlier,
you
can
pay
it,
pay
it,
and
then
the
next
question
is
well
how
much
money
do
we
think
hazel
morrison's
rights
were
infringed
upon
monetarily?
how
do
you
put
a
price
on
the
adversary
system
and
how
do
you
go
to
a
jury
and
tell
them
how
valuable
that
is?
unless
we
have
a
blue-ribbon
panel
of
lawyers.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
not...
being
her
counsel,
i
would
be
forced
to
speculate
as...
just
compensatory--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--oh
yes,
they
are.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
peripherally,
i
am
sure
that
there
are
punitive
and
compensatory
damages
requested.
i
can't
go
any
further
than
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
yes,
and
i...
urge
the
court
to
find
that
whether
they
were
settled,
whether
the
right
exists
and
whether
it
doesn't
exist,
does
not
treat
the
problem
here.
it's
merely
an
extra
form
of
relief.
if
i
felt
in
any
way
that
exchanging
certain
amounts
of
money
would
be
selling
out
the
adversary
system,
i'd
feel
sort
of
like
judas,
giving
up
christ.
because
without
him
it
would
be
all
over.
in
the...
in
fact,
in
the
release...
i
can
tell
the
court
that
in
the
release,
there's
a
statement
that
says
that
this
release
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
criminal
case.
but
that's
getting
out
of
the
record,
so
once
again
i
suggest
to
the
court,
that's
not
part
of
the
record.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
the
civil...
the
civil
relief,
the
civil
case.
it
was
not
only...
via
v.
cliff,
said
that
the
civil
remedy
was
an
extra
remedy
not
an
alternative
remedy--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--oh
yes,
yes.
what
i'm
saying,
i'm...
in
this
case
in
the
court's
record
down
in
the
clerk's
office,
you're
not
going
to
find
the
papers
associated
with
the
civil
suit.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
nothing
binds
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
i'm
not
familiar
with
any--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--particular
cases
like
that,
mr.
justice,
i
know
that
that
situation
exists
if
only
in
discussions
with
my
colleagues
in
the
civil
bar.
perhaps
the
time
has
come--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--you
can
get
into
all
sorts
of
speculations.
i
sometimes
speculate
about
how,
what
would
happen
if
hazel
went
to
steve
hopson
and
said
if
you
don't
get
a
new
prosecutor
who
is
a
little
more
easy
on
me,
then
you
are
not
going
to
see
your
kids
anymore.
so,...
but
one
of
the
points
i
want
to
raise
with
the
court
is
that
when
you
see
this
kind
of
activity
in
a
record,
that
it's
up
to
the
government
to
show
whether
or
not
the
prejudice
has
been
harmful
or
not.
it's
not
up
to
me
to
go
around
and
say
we've
been
prejudiced
because
of
fact
(a),
(b)
or
(c),
with
all
that
discussion
regarding
motions
to
suppress,
illegal
evidence,
tainted
evidence,
the
fact
that
a
new
trial
here
would
not
be
the
appropriate
remedy
because
that
would
particularly
allow
the
situation
to
go
on,
to
give
you
two
bites
out
of
the
apple.
a
civil
remedy
doesn't
help
it.
there's
only
one
remedy,
and
that
is
dismissing
the
prosecution.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
well,
when
you
file
a
motion
to
suppress,
if
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
evidence
has
been
constitutionally
gleaned,
whatever
it
may
be,
whether
it
be
the
statement
or
it
would
be
the
fruits
of
the
evidence.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
no,
it's
not
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
or
the
defense
counsel,
to
show
that
the
item
has
been
unconstitutionally
acquired.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
mr.
justice,
it
is
when
you
have
situations
such
as
this,
which
are
really
violations
of
due
process,
you
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
what
i
call
nice
calculations
as
to
the
extent
of
the
denial,
of
the
right
to
counsel.
it's
up
to
them,
to
suddenly
turn
around
and
say
well,
it
hasn't
been
denied
for
this,
this
and
this
reason.
well,
they
haven't
said
that.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
i
think
they
said
both.
they
said
there
has
been
an
infringement--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--in
terms
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--if
the
court
please,
i
suggest
in
terms
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
the
respondent
did
carry
the
burden,
he
did
prove
his
case.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
i
think
that
really
comes
to
the
next
part
of
my
argument,
mr.
justice.
and
that
is,
i
wouldn't
go
along
with
that
sort
of
opinion.
i
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
decide
that
it's
time
to
dismiss
them
now,
and
not
wait...
and
to
a
certain
extent,
look
at
what
the
government
is
telling
you
in
this
case,
when
they
tell
you
that
we
even
have
regulations
controlling
this
very
kind
of
activity.
and
the
only
difference
between
what
happened
here
and
what
happens
when
we
have
these
regulations,
is
that
we
allow
a
u.s.
attorney
to
make
the
decision
that
stephen
hopson
did.
stephen
hopson
went
to
my
client
and
he
wasn't
interested
in
the
adversary
system,
he
raced
through
his
mind,
he
had
a
jury,
a
trial,
litigated,
all
the
process
went
right
through
his
head,
and
he
decided
that
he
was
going
directly
to
my
client.
and
indeed,
they
told
my
client
and
said,
we'll
give
you
a
dismissal
or
we'll
give
you...
we'll
really
be
harsh
against
you.
well
what
i'm
asking
you
is
for
what
steve
hopson
told
my
client,
that
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
get
her,
not...
the
u.s.
attorney
wasn't
going
to
do
it,
the
judge
wasn't
going
to
do
it.
you
can't
wait
for
the
next
time.
there
may
be
no
next
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
you
wait
for
the
next
five
cases
you
may
not
see
them.
but
i
think
they're
already
there.
and
if
there's
500
cases
like
this,
and
suddenly
you
get
the
floodgates
argument...
like
i
saw
in
their
petition
for
cert,
then
please
bring
the
floodgates
on,
because
doesn't
this
court
want
to
know
if
this
behavior
is
prevalent
in
this
country?
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
the
court
dismisses
the
indictment,
there
will
be
no
next
time.
there
may
have
been
past
occasions
that
the
activity
has
occurred
and
people
are
languishing
in
prison
who
were
afraid
to
raise
this
issue
because
they
struck
a
deal,
told
their
lawyer
to
go...
to
go
somewhere
else,
who
couldn't
raise
it
because
they
couldn't
prove
it.
or,
were
afraid
that
they
would
be
sentenced
harsher
if
the
court
thought
that
they
were
lying.
and
look
what
happened
in
my
case.
we
had...
we
tried--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--your
honor,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court,
there
could
be
innocent
people--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--i'm
not
familiar
with--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
i'm
saying
to
the
court
if
this--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--yes
sir.
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--i
separate
in
my
mind
the
concept
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment
as
it
applies...
as
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
real
physical
evidence.
here,
we
were
talking
about
outrageous
government
activity
it
is
not
up
to
the
respondent
to
show
the
extent
of
the
prejudice,
but
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
show
that
i
have
not
been
prejudiced
by
it.
i
am
also
indicating
to
the
court
that
there
is...
can
be
found
prejudice
here,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
privilege
of
communication
between
me
and
my
client,
that
has
been
infringed.
it
was
infringed,
it
still
is
infringed.
it
chilled
her
confidence
in
me.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
i'm
not
familiar
exactly
the
facts
of
morrisey
v.
brewer,
but
i
will...
i
do
know
that
there's
no
other
case
that
involved
disparaging
counsel
of
a
person's
particular
free
choice,
that
it
would
be
private
counsel
that
makes
it
even
worse.
so
to
that
extent,
then,
the
remedy
in
that
particular
case
is
different
and
distinguished
from
the
kind
of
relief
i'm
asking
here,
in
terms
of
what
has
occurred,
the...
counsel
had
no
way
of
determining
the
validity
of
those
offers
of
negotiation
that
were
made
to
my
client,
when
they
said
to
my
client,
we
can
give
you
x-y-z
if
you
do
a,
b
and
c.
if...
there
was
a
deal
that
was
struck,
how
could
she
enforce
it?
she
lost
that.
of
course,
she
was
sentenced
harshly,
which
has
been
indicated
in
the
reply
brief
that
these
overtures
by
the
government
were
actually
genuine,
uses
the
word
genuine
on
page
3,
says
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
overtures
of
the
government
agents
were
actually
anything
but
genuine,
indeed
they
must
have
been
genuine,
but
we
today
don't
know
whether
or
not
she
was
sentenced
so
harshly
because
of
what
the
agents
said
that
they
could
do.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
five
years,
to
a
girl
who
had
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime
before,
and--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--minimum
sentence
could
have
been
from...
could
have
been
a
suspended
sentence.
the...
there
is
also--
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
--i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
salvatore
j.
cucinotta
now
i
also
believe
that
in
this
case
you
will
find
fear
in
the
petitioner
of
any
further
communications
with
counsel
of
her
choice.
she...
there
are
indications
that
there
were
phone
calls
made
to
her
on
the
third
meeting,
that
russ
was
coming.
and
russ
was
the
investigator.
and
the
person
who
really
showed
up
was
not
russ,
but
it
was
the
dea
agents.
this
is
a
case
that's
replete
with
wiretaps.
you
begin
to
wonder
who's
trusting
who.
if
the
court
please,
this
is
a
case
that
does
not
involve
the
kinds
of
lies
that
you've
seen
the
government
get
involved
in,
in
the
past,
in
terms
of
some
of
these
other
cases.
they
are
just
misstatements
of
the
truth,
you're
involved
in
what
i
consider
extreme
serious
lack
of
understanding
as
to
the
requirements
of
the
sixth
amendment.
if
the
court
please,
my
client
pled
guilty
to
the
best
deal
that
she
could
receive
in
light
of
what
occurred,
in
light
of
what
the
government
did.
to
say
that
there
was
no
problem...
it's
kind
of
similar
to
the
situation
when
you
show
a
gory
picture
to
a
jury
and
you
tell
the
jury
to
forget
about
it,
it
didn't
happen.
well
it
did
happen,
and
as
i
said
earlier,
she
will
never
know
whether
had
she
cooperated,
she
would
have
received
a
lesser
sentence.
and
as
we've
discussed
earlier,
the
question
of
the
remedy
is
only
involved
in
one
thing
and
that
is
dismissal
of
the
charges,
and
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
next
year,
that
some
dea
agent
isn't
out
in
west
philadelphia
saying
to
somebody,
do
you
want
your
lawyer,
the
lawyer
that's
going
to
defend
you
next
week,
come
down
here
at
plea
negotiation
time
and
she
says
yes,
and
he'll
say
well
you
know,
there
was
a
lady
by
the
name
of
hazel
morrison
and
she
wanted
her
lawyer
too.
well
you
know
what,
she's
in
jail.
thank
you.
