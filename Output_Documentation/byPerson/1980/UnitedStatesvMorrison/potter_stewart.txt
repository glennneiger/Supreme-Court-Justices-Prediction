justice
stewart
this
was
a
substantial
time
after
she
had
been
formally
charged,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
the
visit
was--
justice
stewart
--and
was
her
trial
date
set
by
that
time?
justice
stewart
didn't
the
agents
also
tell
her
that
this
judge
before
whom
she
was
scheduled
to
be
tried
was
notoriously
tough,
or--
justice
stewart
in
the
reproduction
of
judge
hunter's
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals,
on
page...
2a
of
the
certiorari
opinion,
this
is
described
as
saying,
"immediately
after
the
announcement
of
the
district
court's
decision
denying
the
motion,
morrison
entered
an
opinion-conditional
plea
of
guilty
to
one
count
of
distribution,
what
does
that
mean?
"
justice
stewart
she
entered
a
conditional
plea
of
guilty?
justice
stewart
thank
you.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
saying
the
same
thing.
can
we
rule
on
the
remedy
point
without
the
sixth
amendment
point?
and
you
still
win
it?
justice
stewart
or
we
could
say
whether
or
not
it
violated
the
constitution,
this
remedy
was
appropriate,
because--
justice
stewart
--of
the
flagrantly,
outrageously
improper
conduct.
justice
stewart
even
though
it
didn't
violate
any
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
stewart
are
they
a
little
different
from
the
ordinary
power
of
a
reviewing
court
to
correct
an
unconstitutional
error?
justice
stewart
i
never
thought
there
was
any
magic
in
the
phrase
supervisory.
justice
stewart
well
that's
something
else
again.
justice
stewart
there
has
been
a
civil
recovery,
i
think
there's
a
reference
to
that--
justice
stewart
and
there
could
be
a
suspended
sentence?
