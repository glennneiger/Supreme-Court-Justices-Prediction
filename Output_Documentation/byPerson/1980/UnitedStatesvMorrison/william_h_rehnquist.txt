justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
statutory
authority
or
authority
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
a
conditional
plea
of
guilty?
justice
rehnquist
do
they
regard
it
as
a
matter
that
they
can
decipher
themselves
apart
from
the
statutes
or
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
justice
rehnquist
well,
lefkowitz
v.
newsome
too,
was
a
case
that
originally
came
up
through
the
new
york
courts--
justice
rehnquist
--where
the
new
york
court
had
allowed
this
sort
of
plea.
justice
rehnquist
does
the
government
disagree
with
judge
garth's
statement
dissenting...
granting
en
banc
consideration
at
page
21(a)
where
he
says
"the
panel's
analysis
reduces
to
the
following
non
sequitur
since
the
dea
agents'
conduct
was
reprehensible,
the
defendant
must
be
granted
some
relief
and
since
there
was
no
disclosure
to
suppress
or
trial
to
retry,
a
dismissal
is
proper?
"
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
supervisory
power
basically
the
power
that
any
appellate
court
has
in
formulating
a
body
of
law
and
deciding
cases
that
it
reviews
from
lower
courts?
justice
rehnquist
but
they
have
it
by
virtue
of
the
right
given
by
congress
to
any
litigant
who
loses
in
the
district
court
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
to
anyone
who
loses
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
petition
for
certiorari
here,
do
they
not?
i
mean--
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
cucinotta,
if
i
might
interrupt
you
for
a
moment,
certainly
the
adversary
system
of
which
you...
which
you
champion
is
important,
albeit...
but
it's
a
part
of
the
administration
of
the
system
of
criminal
justice,
and
your
client
had
been
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
for
possession
of
drugs
and
certainly
society
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
she
is
punished
as
prescribed
by
congress
if
proof
can
be
produced
in
the
normal
way,
and
under
standards
prescribed
by
the
constitution
and
the
statutes.
justice
rehnquist
well,
society...
it's
not
just
one
right
as
opposed
to
nothing
on
the
other
side,
it's
the
system
of
how
the
laws
shall
be
enforced
in
this
country.
and
as
certainly
society,
as
a
whole,
if
it's
going
to
be
governed
by
the
majority
of
the
people
and
by
the
legislative
branch,
has
an
interest
in
seeing
conduct
that
is
proscribed
as
penal
by
the
legislative
branch,
punished
as
prescribed
by
the
legislative
branch
so
long
as
the
constitution
is
not
violated,
does
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
and
they
were
ultimately
settled?
justice
rehnquist
well
why
do
you
say
the
burden
is
on
the
government?
certainly
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
the
burden
is
on
the
party
desiring
suppression.
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
the
law
was
the
other
way?
justice
rehnquist
if
there
is
no
next
time,
as
you
hypothesized
earlier,
then
there
really
is
no
problem.
justice
rehnquist
under
your
argument,
wouldn't...
in
morrisey
v.
brewer,
wouldn't
the
logical
result
have
been
for
this
court
to
order
the
indictment
dismissed
and
not
just
reverse
the
conviction
and
say
you
are
having
a
new
trial.
