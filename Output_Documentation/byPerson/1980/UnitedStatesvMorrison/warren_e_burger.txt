chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
united
states
v.
morrison.
mr.
buscemi,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
does
the
record
show
whether
the
united
states
attorney
was
aware
of
these
visits?
chief
justice
burger
--well,
if
he
was
right
on
his
premise,
then
he
was
sound
on
his
conclusion,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
burger
well
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
third
circuit
has
to
be
justified
under
supervisory
power,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i'm
not
saying
it
is
justified,
it
must
be
justified
in
order
to
have
it
stand.
that's...
isn't
that
your
position?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
federal
appellate
courts
have
a
supervisory
power,
called
by
whatever
name,
which
they
would
not
have
over
state
courts,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
burger
so
that
there
is
something
in
a
supervisory
category
that
is
different
and
distinctive
from
constitutional?
chief
justice
burger
--the
$4500
settlement
in
the
civil
suit
has
some
tendency,
does
it,
do
you
think,
to
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
saying
that
there
was
no
other
remedy
available
for
the
misconduct
of
the
agents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cucinotta.
chief
justice
burger
don't
you
regard
the
$4500
as
some
sort
of
a
remedy?
chief
justice
burger
what
was
the
$4500
for?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
would
refer
you
to
the
remedy
for
this
person,
not
a
broadscale
remedy
for
society?
chief
justice
burger
so
the
$4500
was
the
remedy
for
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
no
remedy
existed.
chief
justice
burger
since
you
put
this
so
heavily
in
your
argument,
on
exposition
and
defense
of
the
adversary
system,
what
if
this
court
had
said
the
next
five
drug
cases
are
all
to
be
dismissed
as
a
result
of
this
misconduct
of
the
government?
would
that
be
an
excessive
remedy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
buscemi?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
morrison
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
