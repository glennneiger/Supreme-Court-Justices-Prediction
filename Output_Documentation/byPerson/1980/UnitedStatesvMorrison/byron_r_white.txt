justice
white
let's
assume
there's
a
plea
of
guilty
that
isn't
conditional.
is
it
appealable?
justice
white
why?
i
mean,
why
isn't
the
plea
of
guilty
appealable?
the
judgment
is
entered
on
the
plea.
justice
white
well,
why
isn't
it
appealable?
justice
white
well
suppose,
suppose
someone
to
whom
this
happened
wants
some
kind
of
vindication
and
brings
a
civil
suit,
claiming
that
the
agent
violated
his
or
her
constitutional
right
to
counsel
and
he
wants
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect
and
a
penny.
he
just
wants
the
people
to
know
that
they
shouldn't
do
that
sort
of
thing.
and
your
submission
is
that
unless
she
can
show
some
interference
at
the
trial
that
there's
just
been
no
violation
whatsoever?
that's
your
first
argument,
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel,
so
the
case
would
be
dismissed
on
a
motion
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
justice
white
that's
all
she
says.
she
just
says
these
things
happened
and
she
says,
"p.s.
there
was
no
interference
with
a
fair
trial.
"
justice
white
or
you
say
it
was
constitutional
for
them
to
do
what
they
did?
justice
white
--so
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
there's
no
constitutional
violation
as
long
as
all...
that
this
was
just
an
attempt?
justice
white
and
that
even
if
there
is...
even
if
it's
a
violation,
you
say
the
remedy
is
just
excessive,
and
i
suppose
you
say,
even
though
there's
no
other
remedy?
justice
white
i
suppose
that
the
fact
of
violation
would
be
not
open
to
relitigation,
in
a
civil
suit?
justice
white
what
did
she
allege
were
her
damages
in
her
civil
suit?
justice
white
those
complaints
aren't...
of
course,
they
are
of
public
record,
i
suppose?
justice
white
do
you
know
what's
in
them,
or
not?
justice
white
what
isn't
part
of
the
record?
justice
white
well,
they
are
a
matter
of
public
record,
though?
justice
white
well,
whatever
burden...
whoever
has
got
the
burden,
i
thought
the
court
below
ruled
that...
one
of
two
things:
either
there
wasn't
any
prejudice
whatsoever,
or
that
whether
there
is
or
not,
whether
there
is
or
not
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
which
did
the
court
say,
no...
there
is
no
prejudice?
justice
white
well
then,
whoever
had
the
burden
carried
it?
justice
white
if
the
government
had
the
burden,
they
must
have
carried
it,
because
the
court
concluded
that
there
wasn't
any
prejudice.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
after
the
respondent,
hazel
morrison
was
indicted
on
a
drug
charge.
and
after
she
had
retained
counsel,
government
agents
called
upon
her.
they
sought
her
cooperation
in
a
related
case
and
among
other
things
disparage
her
retained
lawyer
and
suggested
that
he'd
be
replaced.
she
would
have
none
of
it
and
reported
the
entire
affair
to
her
counsel.
she
then
moved
to
her
counsel
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
that
her
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
been
violated.s
he
alleged
no
specific
prejudice
to
her
case
but
nevertheless
insisted
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed.
the
--
when
the
motion
was
denied,
she
pled
guilty
pursuant
to
a
plea
--
plea
bargain
with
the
government.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
held
not
only
that
her
sixth
amendment
rights
had
been
violated,
but
that
the
conviction
should
be
set
aside
in
the
indictment
dismissed.
we
brought
the
case
here
on
certiorari
at
the
government's
request,
we
reversed.
we
hold
that
in
the
absence
of
showing
some
prejudice
to
the
adequacy
of
her
representation
or
some
other
impact
--
adverse
impact
on
the
fairness
of
the
trial
or
on
the
proceedings
that
it
was
error
to
order
the
indictment
dismissed.
accordingly,
the
judgment
below
is
--
is
reversed
and
the
court
is
unanimous
in
this
regard.
