mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
it
is
proper
to
dismiss
a
criminal
indictment
as
a
sanction
for
misconduct
by
government
agents
that
did
not
affect
the
pending
criminal
prosecution.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
facts
and
simple
and
essentially
undisputed.
in
april
1977,
respondent
sold
approximately
one
ounce
of
heroin
to
a
government
informant.
in
june,
1978,
she
was
indicted
for
that
offense
and
for
another
similar
sale
that
she
allegedly
made
to
the
same
person
in
may
of
'77.
the
two-count
indictment
was
returned
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
sometime
before
she
was
indicted,
respondent
retained
her
present
attorney.
he
has
continued
to
represent
her
throughout
these
proceedings.
in
august
1978,
while
respondent
was
awaiting
trial,
she
was
visited
by
agents
stephen
hopson
and
james
bradley
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
neither
one
of
those
agents
was
the
agent
primarily
responsible
for
investigating
respondent's
case.
they
visited
her
in
order
to
request
her
cooperation
in
their
own
separate
investigation
of
a
major
heroin
dealer
in
the
philadelphia
area--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
indictment
was
returned
on
june
28,
i
believe,
1978.
mr.
peter
buscemi
and
the
visit
was
august,
1978.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
the
trial
date
was
set
for
about...
around
the
middle
of
september.
the
agents
told
respondent
that
she
faced
a
lengthy
jail
sentence
on
the
charges
against
her
and
that
if
she
cooperated,
they
would
make
that
fact
known
to
the
u.s.
attorney.
they
apparently
represented
that
by
cooperating,
she
would
improve
her
chances
for
a
favorable
sentence.
they
also
advised
her
of
the
witness
protection
plan
that
the
government
had
available.
agent
hopson
inquired
whether
respondent
was
represented
by
retained
counsel
or
whether
she
was
represented
by
a
public
defender.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
the
record
shows
that
the
united
states
attorney
was
not
aware
of
these
visits,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
a
contact
between
respondent's
attorney
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
responsible
for
the
case
before
the
indictment
was
ever
returned,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
knew
that
the
agents
were
going
to
visit
respondent.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
respondent
testified
at
the
hearing
that
the
agents
did
refer
to
the
district
judge
as
a
tough
sentencer.
the
agent
himself
said
that
he
couldn't
remember
whether
he
had
made
any
specific
comments
about
the
judge
personally,
but
that
he
certainly
had
told
her
that
she
faced
a
severe
sentence.
with
respect
to
any
of
these
discrepancies
in
the
testimony,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
a
footnote
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
in
which
the
court
says
that
it
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
undisputed
facts,
in
addition
to
any
other
facts
in
the
record
considered
most
favorably
to
the
government,
because
the
district
court
had
made
no
factual
finding.
so
the
court
of
appeals
would
dismiss
the
indictment
even
before
factual
inferences,
if
you
want,
for
the
government.
respondent
told
agent
hopson
the
name
of
her
attorney
and
hopson
asked
her
how
much
she
paid
him.
she
said
$200.
he
asked
her
whether
she'd
ever
seen
the
attorney's
work,
and
he
said
that
he
had
seen
it
in
the
past
and
that
she
should
think
about
the
kind
of
representation
she
should
get
for
$200.
and
he
advised
her
that
if
she
was
interested
in
cooperating,
she
should
seek
the
assistance
of
a
public
defender.
now
respondent
gave
the
agents
no
information.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
suppose
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
respondent
in
any
event,
didn't
say
anything
to
the
agents
and
they
left;
they
left
a
phone
number
where
they
could
be
reached.
she
immediately
called
her
attorney,
he
went
to
her
house
and
at
his
instruction
and
in
his
presence
she
called
agent
hopson
and
said
she'd
like
to
arrange
a
meeting
for
the
next
day.
they
set
a
time
and
the
agents
returned,
but
they
returned
several
hours
later
and
the
respondent
was
home
by
herself,
or
she
said
she
had
company
and
therefore
couldn't
speak
with
them
at
the
time.
agent
hopson
promised
to
call
later
to
set
up
an
appointment
for
the
following
day.
he
did,
and
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
whether
another
agreement
was
made
to
meet,
but
in
any
event
the
agents
returned
for
the
third
time
on
august
25th,
'78,
and
had
essentially
the
same
conversation
with
respondent
that
they
had
had
two
days
before.
again,
respondent
didn't
give
them
any
information,
she
told
them
that
she
only
wished
to
speak
with
them
in
the
presence
of
her
attorney
and
the
agents
left,
saying
that
any
future
discussions
would
be
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office,
with
respondent's
attorney
present.
now
a
few
days
after
that,
right
at
the
beginning
of
september,
'78,
respondent
entered
into
a
conditional
plea
agreement
with
the
government.
she
agreed
to
plead
guilty
to
count
i
of
the
indictment
and
to
drop
her
other
pretrial
motions,
on
the
condition
that
she
be
permitted
to
appeal
in
the
event
the
district
court
denied
her
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that
must
be
a
reprint,
mr.
justice
stewart.
she
entered
a
conditional
plea
of
guilty,
i
don't
know
what
the
word
opinion
is
doing
there.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
in
any
event,
respondent's
plea
was
conditioned
on
her
right
to
appeal
the
denial
of
her
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
the
event
the
district
court
denied
that
motion.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
courts
of
appeals
are
divided
on
that
question.
some
circuits
permit
these
conditional
pleas
and
some
circuits
do
not.
the--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well
the
two
third
circuit
opinions
that
are
cited
in
that
footnote
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--mr.
justice
stewart
just
referred
to,
zudick
and
moskow,
discuss
the
matter
at
some
length
and
i
don't
think
that...
they
don't
find
any
authority
in
the
criminal
rules
for
this
procedure,
but
they
point
out
that
the
appeal
is
from
the
final
judgment
and
the
sentence
that
is
entered
by
the
district
court
and
they
point...
they
analogize
that
situation
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
united
states
v.
haines,
and
lefkowitz
v.
newsome,
they
acknowledge
that
it's
not
exactly
the
same
because
there's
no
constitutional
infirmity
with
the
charge
against
the
defendant.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
matter
of--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
well
the
federal
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
relies
on
is
united
states
against
haines.
in
any
event,
i'd
like
to
inform
the
court
that
there
is
currently
pending
a
revision
of
rule
11
that
would
permit
conditional
pleas.
the
current
version
of
that
rule
would
require
the
consent
of
both
the
defendant
and
the
government
and
it
has
been
endorsed,
i
believe,
by
both
the
aba
and
the
reporter
for
the
criminal
rule.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
i
would
think
that
if
this
plea
of
guilty
was
not
conditioned,
this...
denial
of
this
motion
would
not
be
appealable,
no.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
ordinarily--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--ordinarily,
mr.
justice
white,
the
rule
is
that
the
plea
of
guilty
waives
any
other
objections
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes,
well
i
think
that
that's
just
another
example
of
the
general
proposition
that
there
are
some
matters
that
remain
open
for
appeal,
even
after
a
guilty
plea.
i'm
not
sure
that
an
evidentiary
matter
would
be
one
of
those,
this
kind
of
situation
perhaps
falls
somewhere
in
between
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
which
the
person
has
been
convicted
or
just
the
matter
of
suppression
of
evidence.
in
any
event,
that
was
the
procedure
that
was
adopted
and
the
district
court
thereafter
conducted
a
hearing
on
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
and
then
he
denied
it,
the
district
judge
denied
it
without
rendering
any
opinion.
respondent
pled
guilty
to
count
i,
and
at
the
rule
11
proceeding
that
was
held,
she
admitted
selling
heroin
to
the
government
informant
in
april
1977.
she
then
appealed
the
denial
of
her
motion
to
dismiss,
in
accordance
with
the
agreement;
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
acknowledged
that
respondent
did
not
provide
any
information
to
the
dea.
the
court
said
that
the
importuning
of
the
government
agents
was
unsuccessful.
the
court
didn't
suggest
that
the
agents'
actions
had
damaged
respondent's
relationship
with
her
attorney
in
any
way,
or
whether
her
criminal
prosecution
had
been
affected
by
the
agents'
visits.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
because
of
what
the
court
called
the
agents'
deliberate
attempt
to
destroy
the
attorney-client
relationship.
and
to
subvert
the
defendant's
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
now
apparently,
because
respondent's
conviction
had
not
been
affected
by
the
agents'
conduct,
the
court
concluded
that
this
dismissal
was
the
only
sanction
available
that
would
remedy
the
alleged
constitutional
violation.
but
we've
advanced
two
alternative
arguments
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
incorrect.
they
are
parallel
in
many
respects.
first,
we've
argued
that
the
dea
agents'
actions
did
not
violate
respondent's
right
to
counsel
because
her
criminal
prosecution
was
not
affected,
and
some
discernible
prejudice
is
an
essential
element
with
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
second,
we've
said
that
even
if
the
agents'
conduct
did
infringe
respondent's
constitutional
right,
dismissal
of
the
indictment
is
not
an
appropriate
remedy
here
because
the
violation
caused
respondent
no
injury.
mr.
peter
buscemi
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that's
the
essence
of
the
government's
second
argument,
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
conduct
is
thought
to
violate
respondent's
sixth
amendment
rights
in
some
abstract
sense,
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
this
case
where
there's
been
no
prejudice
whatsoever,
is
to
essentially
reverse
all
the
rules
of
relief
and
remedy
that
have
been
developed
through
the
years,
because
the
more
effective...
i
mean,
the
more
drastic
relief
is
given
in
the
case
where
the
harm
is
the
least
serious,
in
fact,
non-existent.
before
we
even
get
to
that
point,
however,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
respondent's
sixth
amendment
rights
weren't
violated
at
all.
the
sixth
amendment
provides
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
his
defense.
respondent
had
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
her
defense
at
all
stages
of
the
prosecution.
she
doesn't
suggest
that
her
counsel's
assistance
was
in
any
way
impaired
and
therefore
the
literal
command
of
the
amendment
seems
to
have
been
satisfied.
the
court
of
appeals'
error
was
that
it
focused
on
the
impropriety
of
the
agents'
conduct,
rather
than
on
the
effect
of
the
conduct
on
respondent.
and
that's
not
to
say
that
these
attempts
by
the
government's
agents
to
interfere
with
the
attorney-client
relationship
should
be
condoned;
it
is
only
to
say
that
the
attempt
in
and
of
itself
is
not
enough
to
violate
the
right
to
counsel.
the
sixth
amendment
comprises
a
number
of
these
procedural
guarantees
to
ensure
fairness
of
criminal
prosecutions.
if
a
government
agents'
attempt
to
deny
a
defendant
of
those
guarantees
fails,
the
defendant's
right
is
fully
exercised,
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding
is
not
affected
and
no
constitutional
violation
has
occurred.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
assuming
that
there
was
no
prejudice
alleged--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
the
burden
of
this
first
argument
is
that
no
constitutional
violation
has
occurred.
again,
that's
not
to
say
that
this
was
right,
it's
just
to
say
that
the
constitutional
rights
haven't
been
violated.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
that's
an
affirmative
statement;
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
i
would
say
that
it
was
improper
but
it
didn't
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
you
certainly
could
say
that
whether
or
not
this
violated
the
sixth
amendment,
this
remedy
was
inappropriate,
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
that's
essentially
what
the
court--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
what
the
court
of
appeals'
panel
said,...
the
court
of
appeals'
panel
said
that
the
constitution
had
been
violated.
now
if
the
constitution
hasn't
been
violated,
and
no
statute
has
been
violated,
we've
run
into
the
kind
of
problem
that's
raised
in
a
case
like
jacobs,
for
example,
where
we're
trying
to
decide
what
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
is,
to
dismiss
criminal
charges
in
the
absence
of
any
constitutional
or
statutory
violation.
and
that's...
at
least,
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
that
situation
is
not
presented
here.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
it
depends
on
how
you
use
the
phrase
supervisory
power.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
action
was
necessary
in
order
to
vindicate
respondent's
rights
under
the
sixth
amendment.
it
rested
the
decision
on
the
constitutional
provision.
as
i
understand
supervisory
power,
it
ordinarily
is
a
phrase
used
in
cases
where
no
statutory
or
constitutional
violation
is
involved
but
the
court
nevertheless
desire
to
adjust
certain
conduct
that
it
believes
is
inappropriate
for
one
reason
or
another.
mr.
peter
buscemi
i
think
that's
probably
a
good
way
to
look
at
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
it
really
is
no
different
than
the
general
decisionmaking
power
that
the
court
has
to
decide
the
case
or
controversy
before
it.
i
mean,
supervisory
power,
seems
to
me
to
be
little
different
in
many
ways
from
the
common
law
development
of
cases.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
mr.
justice
stewart--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--i
agree
that
there's
no
magic
in
that
word,
the
question
of
whether
the
supervisory
power
should
be
used
to
dismiss
indictments
when--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--exactly.
mr.
peter
buscemi
right.
that's
correct,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
but--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well
that's
right.
i
mean,
there's
no
question
that
the
court's
supervisory
power
is
dependent
upon
the
acquiescence
of
congress.
i
mean,
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
absence
of
any...
if
congress
decides
to
change
this
court's
supervisory
power
in
some
way,
it
can
do
so.
i
mean
that
point
was
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
last
term
in
the
japan
case.
mr.
peter
buscemi
that's
the
burden
of
the
first
argument,
is
there's
an
attempt
to
violate
the
constitution
but
it
didn't
succeed
and
so
there's
no
violation.
now--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes,
i
would,
although
in
this
case,
i...
i
mean,
as
we
informed
the
court
in
our
reply
brief,
there
has
been
civil
recovery
of
a
substantial
nature,
but
in
any
event--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
a
civil
suit,
because
as
part
of
the
terms
of
the
settlement
there's
been
a
waiver
of
all
future
claims
against
the
government
or
its
agents
as
a
result
of
the
conduct
that's
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
government's
second
argument.
the
only
other
point
that
i
thought
i'd
make
on
the
first
argument,
to
refer
the
court
to
massiah,
which
i
think
is
instructive
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
court
decided
the
case
focusing
on
the
use
of
the
evidence
at
trial
rather
than
the
way
in
which
the
evidence
was
obtained.
i
recommend...
i
commend
that
part
of
massiah
to
the
court's
attention,
i
think
we
quoted
from
it
at
some
length
in
the
brief.
now
on
the
second
point,
to
pick
up
where
mr.
justice
rehnquist
left
off
in
his
question
earlier,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
remedy
is
thoroughly
disproportionate
to
what
actually
happened
in
this
case.
as
judge
garth
observed
in
his
dissent,
the
panel's
decision
effectively
puts
respondent
in
a
better
position
because
she
wasn't
prejudiced
by
the
agents'
conduct
than
she
would
have
been
in
if
she
had
suffered
some
harm.
because
in
that
event,
the
existing
more
common
remedies
would
have
relieved
her
of
any
unfairness
in
the
criminal
prosecution;
evidence
that
had
been
obtained
could
have
been
suppressed,
or
a
new
trial
could
have
been
ordered,
if
her
trial
had
been
tainted,
but
in
this
case,
since
she
suffered
no
prejudice
she
winds
up
better
off
and
the
charges
against
her
are
completely
dismissed.
even
in
gideon,
where
there
was
no
attorney
at
all,
at
any
time,
in
the
prosecution,
the
remedy
was
a
new
trial
with
an
attorney,
not
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
and
i
think
that,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
it
would
be
inconceivable
for
this
court
to
hold
that
a
fourth
amendment
violation
that
resulted
in
no...
in
the
acquisition
of
no
evidence,
should
result
in
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
for
that
reason,
rather
than
the
suppression
of
any
evidence
that
might
have
been
found.
even
in,
in
the
fifth
amendment
context,
in
united
states
against
blue,
where
there
allegedly
was
some
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination,
the
court
specifically
said
that
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
too
drastic
a
remedy;
the
only
remedy
to
which
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
was
suppression
of
that
evidence.
now,
i
think
that
in
this
respect
the
court
of
appeals'
main
error
is
that
it
assumed
that
whatever
remedy
there
could
be
had
to
be
a
remedy
in
this
criminal
proceeding.
this
criminal
proceeding
involves
events
that
occurred
16
months
earlier,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
agent's
visit.
the
agent's
visit
was
wrong,
but
it
didn't
affect
that
proceeding
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
any
relief
awarded
has
to
be
awarded
in
the
pending
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
there's
been...
the
reply
brief
describes
the
civil
recovery
at
the
very
beginning,
i
think,
on
pages
1
and
2.
respondent
received,
i
believe,
$4500,
25
%
of
which
was
to
be
paid
to...
was
designated
for
attorneys
fees.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
attorney
in
the
criminal
case
filed
an
independent
lawsuit
against
the
dea
agents,
charging
them
with
defamation
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
with
respondent
and
he
did
recover
$2,000,
again,
25
%
of
that
to
be
paid
to
his
attorney
in
the
civil
suit.
now,
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
addressing
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
court
of
appeals'
asserted
need
for
prophylactic
action
in
this
area.
i
want
to
emphasize
as
i've
said
before
that
this
was
not
proper
conduct
and
no
one
for
the
government
has
ever
asserted
that
it
is
proper
conduct,
it's
also
not
the
law
enforcement
policy
of
the
dea
or
any
other
federal
agency.
and
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
in
that
connection
to
the
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
that
we've
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief,
which
discusses
the
general
problem
of
agents
contacts
with
represented
defendants
in
the
absence
of
their
attorney.
and
it
states
unequivocally
that
the
government's
general
rule
is
that
there
should
be
no
such
contact
without
the
consent
of
the
attorney.
there
are
some
peculiar
situations
that
may
arise
that
might
necessitate
such
a
contact,
and
they
are
discussed
in
some
detail
in
that
letter.
but
the
general
rule
is
that
there
should
be
no
such
contact.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well
that's
certainly
true
as
to
the
second
prong
of
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
of
course,
if
this
court
rules
in
accordance
with
the
first
part
of
our
argument
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
here,
there
would
be
nothing
to
remedy,
and
the
unavailability
of
another
procedure
would
not
be
a
problem.
but
at
least
if
there
was
a
violation
i
think
that
this
civil
recovery
is
very
significant,
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
an
alternative
remedy.
finally,
even
if...
we've
cited
some
court
of
appeals
cases
in
our
brief
that
generally
support
the
government's
position
here,
but
leave
open
the
possibility
that
dismissal
of
an
indictment
may
be
permissible
if
the
court
finds
itself...
as
a
last
resort,
unable
otherwise
to
change
a
longstanding
repeated
pattern
of
government
misconduct,
even
if
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
allegation
or
evidence
of
any
such
pattern
of
government
misconduct
in
this
case
and
we
think
that
that's
an
inappropriate
basis
on
which
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
dismissal.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
just
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
is
like
to
answer,
i
think,
how...
what
the
maximum
and
minimum
sentences
are
under
21
u.s.c.
841(a)(1),
and
i
think
it's
zero
to
15
years.
there's
no
minimum
sentence
under
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--and
there
could
be
a
suspended
sentence,
that's
right.
