justice
marshall
what
are
you
talking
about?
that's
what
i
don't
follow.
what
are
you
saying,
what
would
have
happened
if
the
worst
had
happened?
what
would
have
happened?
justice
marshall
what
about
this
case?
what
do
you
say
happened
at
this
trial?
justice
marshall
were
you
stopped
at
anything
you
tried
to
do
at
this
trial?
justice
marshall
what
did
the
judge
or
anybody
else
do
to
prohibit
you
from
doing
what
you
wanted
to
do
in
this
trial?
justice
marshall
well
try.
justice
marshall
try
and
find
something
that
you
were
deprived
of
doing,
or
denied
the
right
to
do.
justice
marshall
just
anything,
i
mean,
not
letting
you
go
to
the
john
or
something,
anything.
justice
marshall
no,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
referring
to
the
government's
argument
at
all.
i'm
talking
about
what
i'm
asking
you.
you
say
that
you...
something
the
government
did
deprived
this
appellant,
this
respondent,
of
a
fair
trial
and
association
with
counsel.
justice
marshall
now
what?
justice
marshall
how
would
that
hurt
her?
justice
marshall
well
how
did
that
hurt
her?
justice
marshall
how
did
it
hart
her
at
the
trial?
justice
marshall
i
thought
she
pleaded
guilty?
justice
marshall
well,
did
they
do
it?
justice
marshall
did
they
succeed?
justice
marshall
well,
what
did
you
get
this
$4500
for?
justice
marshall
were
you
intimidated
in
any
way?
justice
marshall
in
this...
this
case?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
well,
you'd
know
whether
you
are
intimidated
or
not,
don't
you?
don't
you?
justice
marshall
was
that
this
case?
justice
marshall
yes.
and
that
intimidated
you?
justice
marshall
how?
justice
marshall
you
know--
justice
marshall
--you
know
you're
not
guilty,
don't
you?
you
know,
i'm
looking
at
you
and
to
me,
you
don't
appear
to
be
the
person
that's
easily
intimidated.
then,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
marshall
i'm
not
wrong,
am
i?
justice
marshall
that's
right,
i
thought
so.
i
thought
so--
justice
marshall
that
doesn't
quite
bind
us,
does
it?
justice
marshall
okay.
thank
you.
you
know,
the
reference
to
the
civil
litigation
brings
to
mind
other
situations
which
are
not
ones
the
bar
is
terribly
proud
of,
but
there
are
occasions
when
claim
adjusters,
for
example,
go
to
a
plaintiff
in
a
personal
injury
suit
without
telling
counsel
and
make
the
same
kind
of
slanderous
remarks
about
counsel.
has
there
ever
been
a
suggestion
that
the
appropriate
remedy
in
that
case
is
to
make
some
kind
of
a
ruling
on
the
merits
in
the
litigation?
justice
marshall
you
know,
there
are
actually
some
innocent
people
in
jail.
so
i
don't
know
what
all
this
argument's
about.
justice
marshall
do
you
suggest
to
the
court
that
because
something
happened
in
some
case
80
years
ago,
in
the
state
of
washington,
that
your
client
should
go
free
in
philadelphia?
justice
marshall
well
you're
talking
about
all
these
people
in
prison.
clients
of
yours?
justice
marshall
well
how
do
you
know
about
them?
justice
marshall
one
situation
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
--what
was
the
minimum
sentence?
justice
marshall
for
some
of
them
it's
a
five-year
minimum.
mandatory.
some
have...
are
you--
justice
marshall
--i
think
he
might
know.
justice
marshall
isn't
there
one
thats
about
a
five
year
minimum.
i'm
not
sure
if
there
is
anymore
minimum
at
this
time
your
honor,
but
it's
not
under
this
provision.
but
there
was.
thank
you,
your
honors.
