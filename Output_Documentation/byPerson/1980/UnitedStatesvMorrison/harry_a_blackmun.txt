justice

--did
the
attorney
get
something
in
addition
to
that,
or
was
that--
justice
blackmun
somewhere,
will
you...
if
you've
done
it,
i
missed
it,
will
you
give
me
your
answer
to
judge
garth's
observation
in
his
dissent
and
denial
of
the
rehearing
en
banc,
that
your
position
is
such
that
when
there
is
prejudice
such
as
by
the
admission
of
illegal
evidence,
there
is
a
new
trial.
but
here
where
there
is
no
prejudice,
that
the
indictment
was
dismissed,
how
do
those
things
square?
