well
what
about
the
mccarthy
case,
the
original
case
on
rule
11,
wasn't
that
a
direct
appeal?
where
you
challenge
the
procedure
of
the
arraignment.
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
that
argument.
well,
if
he'd
been
successful
she
would
have
fired
you
and
gotten
the
public
defender.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
think,
you're
not
implying
the
public
defenders
are
faithless
to
their
clients,
are
you?
justice
stevens
well
are
you
implying
that?
are
you--
justice
stevens
--pardon
me?
justice
stevens
since
it's
exactly
the
same
threat
to
the
adversary
system.
justice
stevens
maybe
by
analogy
what
you
should
do
is
enter
judgment
against
the
insurance
company
in
those
cases?
