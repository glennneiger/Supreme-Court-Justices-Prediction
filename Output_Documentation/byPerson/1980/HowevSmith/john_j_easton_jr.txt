mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
above
all
else
this
case
is
not
merely
a
case
of
statutory
construction
but
it
involves
the
ability
of
vermont
and
similar
states
to
provide
a
dignified
and
humane
approach
to
dealing
with
those
who
run
afoul
of
the
law.
maybe
stated
differently,
the
question
is,
may
vermont
continue
to
operate
a
community-based
correction
system
where
offenders,
more
than
95
percent
of
those
housed
in
vermont,
where
they
have
the
right
to
be
integrated
back
into
the
community.
or
must
we
return
to
the
conditions
that
existed
in
1974,
when
we
decided
to
close
down
the
maximum
security
prison,
when
we
were
spending
a
full
25
percent
of
our
resources
on
two
percent
of
those
incarcerated?
i
think
that's
really
the
issue.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
that's
not
in
dispute,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
are
participants
in
not
only
the
new
england
compact
but
also
the
national
compact.
we
have
made
agreements
with
the
new
england
states
and
most
of
the
other
states
in
the
country.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
one
of
the
considerations,
though,
justice
stewart,
is
that
just
looking
at
the
other
new
england
states,
most
of
those
states,
they
themselves
have
the
same
problems
that
vermont
has,
overcrowding,
lack
of
humane
facilities,
facilities
just
not
equipped
to
deal
with
prisoners
such
as
mr.
howe.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
that
it
does,
and
we
have
a
compact
with
them.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
certainly
it
exists
in
veterinary
school
and,
i
believe,
medical
school.
i'm
not
sure
if
it
exists
in
law
schools
too.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
that's
correct.
it's
a
private
institution.
i
guess
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
that
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
which
has
been
described
as,
in
fact,
i
think,
in
one
of
the
lono
opinions
as
one
of
the
best
penal
systems
in
the
world,
that
having
that
available
to
us
for
the
five
percent
of
those
prisoners
who
need
the
facilities
enables
us
to
have
a
community-based
correction
system
to
care
for
the
remaining
95
percent
of
those
who
can
be
integrated
back
into
our
community.
we're
talking,
in
a
state
like
vermont,
of
a
very
small
correctional
system.
we
have
less
than
500
prisoners.
we
have
3,700
probationers.
our
whole
corrections
population
is
smaller
than
the
size
of
several
state
institutions.
our
system
consists
of
six
facilities
around
the
state,
four
community
correction
centers
and
two
state-wide
centers.
the
largest
only
has
a
capacity
of
less
than
150.
all
the
rest
are
under
100.
these
are--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--we're
not
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
if
there's
an
entitlement,
that
then
under
the
federal
statute
that
we
have
to
meet
that
entitlement
for
mr.
howe.
we're
saying
here,
though,
that
there
is
no
special
entitlement
that
he
is
entitled
to,
and
therefore
we
shouldn't
get
bogged
down
on
that
issue.
there
is
no
special
constitutional
or
statutory
entitlement
that
he
deserves,
and
so
to
accept
his
argument
that
he's
got
to
have
some
specialized
treatment,
then
that
hampers
the
ability
of
vermont
to
properly
administer
its
correctional
system,
and
i
think
this
court
has
long
held
that
such
a--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
the
court
below
found--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--as
the
court
below
found,
justice
stevens,
even
if
some
of
the
same
activities
and
programs
were
available
in
vermont,
they're
less
accessible
to
mr.
howe
because
of
his
need
for
maximum
security
incarceration.
we
literally
do
not
have
the
ability
on
the
long-term
basis
to
house
a
prisoner
of
this
sort,
and
so
therefore,
while
there
may
be
some
programs
that
are
parallel
from
our
system
into
the
federal
system,
for
a
prisoner
who
is
there
on
a
long-term
basis,
who
presents
a
maximum
security
risk,
as
mr.
howe
did,
then
they're
far
less
accessible.
i
think
it's
interesting,
it's
contained
in
the
petition
of
certiorari
in
hawaii
v.
mederios,
the
finding
of
the
magistrate
in
illinois
who
said
the
states
are
literally
faced
with
the
unenviable
position
of
having,
if
the
returned
prisoners
like
this
are
returned
to
the
states,
then
they're
placed
in
conditions
that
literally
are
inhumane
and
they'd
be
making
arguments
for
eighth
amendment
freedom,
or
the
states
have
to
release
them.
so,
it
puts
us
in
a
very
untenable
position
if
we
do
not
have
the
freedom
and
flexibility
to
contract
with
the
federal
government
for
this
type
of
prisoner.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor,
and
also--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--well,
petitioner's
counsel
said
he
wants
to
be
in
vermont,
but
the
statute
which
he
challenges--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--i
think,
perhaps.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
i
think,
regardless
of
where
the
federal
facility
is--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--that's
correct.
what
i
want
to
impress
upon
the
court
here
is
that
there
has
been
no
finding
by
any
of
the
courts
below
that
there
is
any
constitutional
right
here,
nor
is
there
any
statutory
right.
so
absent
that,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
state
administration--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--perhaps
i
stated
it
wrong.
let
me
say,
justice
white,
that
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
any
entitlement,
despite
the
claim,
whether
the
statute
gives
him
any
entitlement.
and
we
suggest
that--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--first
of
all,
he's
not
of
course
challenging
vermont's
statute,
he's
challenging
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
statute
has
been
found
to
say
that
we're
talking
about
care
and
custody
and
subsistence
and
education
and
treatment
and
training,
and
he
is
challenging
the
treatment
aspect,
trying
to
give
that
a
primacy
that
it
doesn't
deserve.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
he
has
to.
however--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--he
has
to
have
some
basis
on
which
to
challenge
his
custody,
and
he's
challenging
the
basis
in
the
statute
under
5003.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
he's
attacking
5003
and
his
attack
on
5003--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
he's
invoking
it
and
attacking
the
concept
of
treatment,
suggesting
that--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--and
then
we
get
to
5003,
which
he
invokes,
as
justice
stewart
suggests--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
then
he
gets
to
5003,
piggy-backing,
and
saying
that
under
5003
he's
got
to
receive
some
specialized
treatment.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
well,
i
think
justice
white,
in
his
question
that
he
presents,
that
he
himself
is
saying
that
there's
got
to
be
a
finding
under
5003.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct,
as
his
counsel
stated,
that
it
involves
the
construction
of
that
statute.
and
he
is
suggesting
that
the
word
"treatment"
in
that
statute
be
given
some
sort
of
primacy
that
the
court
below
found
it
not
necessary
to
give.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
now
that
it's
here
before
this
court,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
dispose
of
it
to
avoid
this
very
troublesome
situation
that
exists
in
the
circuits
where
the
7th
circuit
has
ruled
one
way
and
the
1st,
2nd,
3rd,
and
10th
circuits...
because
otherwise
the
states
will
be--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--that's
true.
he's
entitled--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--what
would
happen
is,
i
think
we'd
get
in
that
position
that
justice
marshall
suggested
earlier,
is
that
we
would
have
the
prisoner
trying
to
wander
back
and
forth
between
the
two
systems
and
that's
the
result--
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
--exactly.
that's
the
result
we
want
to
avoid
by
construing
this
statute,
5003(a),
not
to
give
him
some
special
entitlement
to
treatment.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
that's
correct.
there's
no
challenge
to
that.
mr.
john
j.
easton,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
we
haven't
gone
that
far
but
we
have
integrated
the
vermont
system
as
part
of
our
corrections
philosophy,
so
that
those
who
need
the
entitlements
which
vermont
statutes
give
them,
if
offered
by
the
federal
system,
we
can
take
advantage
of
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
