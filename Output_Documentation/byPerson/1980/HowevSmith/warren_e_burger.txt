chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
robert
howe
v.
attorney
general.
mr.
nelson,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
did
i
hear
you
correctly
to
either
say
or
imply
that
there
is
some
legal
obligation
to
treat
him?
chief
justice
burger
why
do
you
make
it
any
different
when
it's
in
federal
custody
as
a
surrogate
for
the
state,
than
when
he
is
in
the
state
custody
with
the
state
doing
it
on
its
own
behalf?
chief
justice
burger
not
necessarily.
suppose
it's
a
brunch
out
in
the
back
yard?
how
about
a
luau?
why
do
you
say
there
is
such
a
rigidity
in
it?
chief
justice
burger
some
food.
well,
what
if
you
invite
him
for
custody?
chief
justice
burger
are
not
the
records
at
the
federal
prison
maintained
on
the
conduct
and
behavior
of
the
prisoner
and
all
of
the
factors
that
go
into
whether
a
prisoner
is
going
to
be
eligible
for
parole?
chief
justice
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
vermont
constitution
or
statutes
that
requires
that
vermont
prisoners
convicted
in
vermont
courts
be
kept
in
custody
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state?
chief
justice
burger
then,
they,
theoretically,
they
could
send
them
to
devil's
island
if
they
wanted
to,
couldn't
they,
if
there
were
such
a
place
now?
chief
justice
burger
that's
why
you
focus
on
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
receive
rather
than
the
power
of
the
vermont
court
to
transfer?
chief
justice
burger
what
can
5003
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
federal
system
will
help
absorb...
say...
prisoners
on
request
and
use
its
unused
capacity?
what
else
was
that
statute
passed
for?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
the
language
of
the
statute
tell
us?
if
the
language
is
clear,
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
the
legislative
history,
do
we?
chief
justice
burger
well,
but
the
core
of
this
statute,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
core
of
it,
is
that
the
federal
government
can
make
available,
congress
has
said
the
federal
government
can
make
available
unused
space
in
its
institutions
for
state
prisoners.
chief
justice
burger
well,
why
do
you
have
to
parse,
the
particular
words
in
order
to
discern
that
meaning?
chief
justice
burger
where
are
the
words
that
lead
you
to
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
burger
where
are
the
words?
which
words
lead
you
to
the
mental
problem?
chief
justice
burger
it
may
mean
that
to
you
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
necessarily
to
everyone.
chief
justice
burger
adequate
treatment
means,
do
they
have
the
space,
do
they
have
the
facilities
to
take
on
more
inmates?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
treatment
means
only
treatment
for
a
mental
problem?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting,
do
i
take
the
argument
to
mean
that
this
institution
does
not
have
a
medical
unit,
for
example,
to
deal
with
people
who
become
ill,
or
that
they
have
no
facilities
to
deal
with
a
person
who
has
alcoholic
tendencies
when
he
arrives,
although
surely
he
couldn't
become
an
alcoholic
after
he
got
there?
chief
justice
burger
perhaps.
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
you're
here
challenging,
as
you
said
earlier,
not
the
authority
of
vermont
to
send
him
but
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
receive.
chief
justice
burger
where
is
your
standing,
your
client's
standing
to
challenge
what
the
federal
government
is
doing,
even
though
it's
holding
him
in
custody?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
not
18
u.s.c.
5003
an
act
of
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
etkind.
chief
justice
burger
let's
assume
that
a
state,
a
given
state,
not
vermont,
had
a
provision
in
its
criminal
statutes
governing
its
institutions,
that
any
prisoners
on
coming
in
would
be
examined
and
classified,
and
if
they
were
found
to
have
particular
problems,
for
example,
alcoholism
and
emotional
disorders,
then
the
statute
would
provide
in
that
state,
shall
receive
treatment
for
such
condition.
now,
could
that
prisoner
be
transferred
to
a
federal
institution
absent
a
certification
by
someone
that
treatment
was
available?
in
other
words,
absent
that
situation,
they
would
not
be
complying
with
the
state
statute.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
congress
in
passing
5003--
chief
justice
burger
--i
would
think
must
be
assumed
to
have
taken
into
account
that
perhaps
some
states
do
require
some
kind
of
treatment.
and,
of
course,
it's
well
known
that
all
the
federal
prisons
do
provide
some
forms
of
treatment.
would
you
think
that
might
have
been
in
the
contemplation
of
congress
in
drafting
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock
today.

[recess.]
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it
that
your
friend's
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
federal
institution
to
which
the
transfer
was
made
were
200
yards
away
from
your
closed
institution
in
vermont.
do
you
assume
that
that's
the
case?
chief
justice
burger
it
isn't
the
cut-of-state
factor,
it's
the
transfer
to
a
federal
institution.
chief
justice
burger
that's
a
little
sweeping
for
the
argument,
perhaps.
well,
it
might
have
been
the
motivation
for
his
lawsuit.
chief
justice
burger
i
thought
his
entire
argument
was
focusing
on
the
term
5003(a).
chief
justice
burger
your
friend,
i
think,
if
i
recall
correctly,
conceded
that
there
was
nothing
in
vermont
law,
including
its
constitution,
to
prohibit
vermont
from
having
its
penal
institutions
in
another
state.
now--
chief
justice
burger
--hasn't
the
state
of
vermont
made
this
federal
facility
its
prison
by
making
a
contract
under
5003,
making
it
a
surrogate
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
nelson,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
vermont
can't
make
some
other
entity
a
surrogate,
including
a
private
corporation?
suppose
some
group
of
people
got
together,
penologists
in
the
universities,
set
up
a
private,
nonprofit
corporation
to
do
better
than
most
of
the
penal
institutions
do,
much
like
setting
up
the
postal
corporation
outside
of
the
old
system,
do
you
say
that
vermont
could
not
incarcerate
its
prisoners
in
that
kind
of
an
institution?
chief
justice
burger
anywhere.
two
hundred
yards
down
the
road
or
2,000
miles
away
in
alaska,
or

miles.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
