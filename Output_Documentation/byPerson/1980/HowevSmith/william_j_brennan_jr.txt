justice
jr.
but
mr.
attorney
general,
actually,
basically,
as
my
brother
white
suggests,
he's
challenging
his
detention
by
the
federal
authorities
as
illegal
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
isn't
he?
justice
jr.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he
has
an
entitlement?
justice
jr.
yes,
his
challenge
is
that
laws
of
the
united
states
expressly
say
you
can't
do
this,
you
cannot
deliver
me
to
a
federal
authority.
