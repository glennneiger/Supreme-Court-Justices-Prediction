that
is,
after
a
federal
criminal
trial.
justice
stewart
because
of
that
statute.
justice
stewart
and
maybe,
as...
there's
just
no
treatment
for
him
except
custody.
justice
stewart
in
which
case
it's
your
claim
that
he
cannot
be
transferred
to
a
federal
facility.
justice
stewart
the
first
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
private
right
of
action,
isn't
there?
justice
stewart
but
isn't
that
the
first,
threshold
question?
justice
stewart
no,
no,
his
implied
right
of
action
comes
from
a
different
section,
i
think.
justice
stewart
yes.
(a).
justice
stewart
well,
that's
the
argument
on
the
merits,
but
there's
a
threshold
question
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
of
action
to
bring
the
lawsuit
such
as
the
one
that
was
brought
here,
which
was
not
habeas
corpus.
justice
stewart
but
the
normal
remedy
of
habeas
corpus,
the
normal
request,
is
for
release.
justice
stewart
that
he's
detained
illegally?
justice
stewart
you
do
have
agreements
with
other
states,
don't
you?
justice
stewart
which
would
allow
vermont
to
carry
on
its
present
regimes--
justice
stewart
--even
though
the
federal
prison
system
were
not
available
to
you.
justice
stewart
but
new
hampshire,
for
example,
i
think,
has
a
maximum
security
institution.
justice
stewart
vermont
has
its
own
law
school
now.
justice
stewart
but
his
legal
claim
would
be
the
same,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
if
the
federal
facility
were
200
yards
away
from
the
state
facility.
justice
stewart
yes;
the
issue
is
the
same.
justice
stewart
he's
invoking
5003.
no,
no...
no,
no.
