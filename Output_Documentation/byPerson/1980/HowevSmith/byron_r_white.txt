justice
white
would
it
be
your
submission
that
absent
this
statute
there
would
be
no
authority
to
receive
a
state
prisoner
at
all?
justice
white
why
would
that
be?
justice
white
how
have
you
brought
the...
you've
asserted
jurisdiction
under
1346,
and
you
do
claim
that
you
have
a
right
rooted
in
4001,
i
take
it.
you
might
have
said
that
you're
being
held
illegally
and
that
you
have
a
right
to
habeas
corpus.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
are
claiming
that
your
custody
is
illegal.
justice
white
by
the
united
states
and
i
suppose
if
you
could
claim,
at
least
you
have
the
right
to
habeas
corpus
whether
you
have
the
right
under
4001
or
not.
justice
white
well,
the
claim
certainly
is
that
there's
a
statutory
right
not
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
government.
their
claim
is
that
the
statute
forbids
custody
of
this
prisoner
by
the
federal
government.
justice
white
well,
you
can
call
it
what
you
want
to,
but
he
says
that
my
custody
by
the
united
states
is
illegal.
and
he's
making
what's
equivalent
to
a
habeas
corpus
claim,
which
is
a
classic
claim
under
habeas
corpus,
that
this
custody
is
illegal.
justice
white
he's
claiming
it
under
that
the
federal
government
may
not
have
custody
of
this
prisoner
unless
there
is
some
other
law
that
authorizes
it.
justice
white
his
claim
isn't
on
5003;
his
claim
is
on
4001.
justice
white
no,
it's
the
government
that's
relying
on
5003.
no,
he
is.
justice
white
well,
then,
the
case
should
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
federal
question,
to
raise
a
federal
question
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
under
1346.
justice
white
what
would
you
say
if
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
against
the
federals?
of
course,
you
may
not
even
be
in
the
case.
justice
white
and
saying
that,
basing
it
on
4001
saying,
my
custody
is
illegal
under
4001.
the
united
states
would
come
back
and
say,
sorry
but
it's
authorized
under
5003,
as
a
defensive
matter.
