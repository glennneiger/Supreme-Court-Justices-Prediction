but
5003
isn't
limited
to
treatment.
it
says,
"custody,
care,
subsistence,
education,
treatment,
and
training.
"
doesn't
it?
justice
marshall
it
doesn't,
it
isn't
limited
to
treatment?
justice
marshall
well,
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
say
it.
justice
marshall
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
say
it.
you
kept
just
using
the
one
word
"treatment".
justice
marshall
was
that
done
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
well,
couldn't
that
be
facilities
for
treatment?
justice
marshall
answer
my
question;
it's
my
question.
justice
marshall
could
the
federal
government
release
him?
justice
marshall
could
the
federal
government
release
him?
justice
marshall
so
who
is
he
in
the
custody
of?
except
on
the
say-so
of
vermont.
whose
custody
is
that,
now?
whose
custody
is
he
in?
justice
marshall
well,
are
we
interested
in
any
sense
other
than
a
legal
sense?
justice
marshall
is
it
legal?
justice
marshall
so
he's
not
in
the
legal
custody
of
anybody.
that's
a
lovely
position.
i
know
a
lot
of
prisoners
would
love
that
position.
justice
marshall
is
there
any
treatment
in
the
vermont
prisons
that's
not
available
in
the
federal
prisons?
justice
marshall
equivalent?
justice
marshall
what
do
you
have
in
vermont
like
springfield?
justice
marshall
what
does
the
prison
system
in
vermont
have
similar
to
springfield
in
the
federal
prisons?
justice
marshall
it
would
the
whole
state
of
vermont.
justice
marshall
oh,
sure,
but
is
it
the
equivalent?
justice
marshall
well,
that
was
my
question;
equivalent.
justice
marshall
if
congress
takes
the
word
"treatment"
out
would
you
give
up?
justice
marshall
solely
because
of
the
word
"treatment"?
justice
marshall
you
told
me,
i
said,
if
we
took
the
word
"treatment"
out
would
you
be
out?
and
you
said,
yes.
justice
marshall
so
you
have
changed.
now
what's
your
latest?
justice
marshall
and
hoping
to
get
lost.
