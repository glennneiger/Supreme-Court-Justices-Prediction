justice
stevens
mr.
nelson,
it's
entirely
a
different
question.
i
just
want
to
get
something
straight
in
my
mind.
you
don't
raise
any
challenge,
do
you,
to
the
power
of
the
vermont
authorities
to
enter
into
contracts
for
the
placement
of
people
in
their
custody
elsewhere?
justice
stevens
so,
if
there's
any...
you're
suggesting,
though,
is
if
vermont
had
entered
into
a
contract,
say,
with
new
hampshire,
for
new
hampshire
to
take
over
while
they
remodeled
their
prisons
or
something
like
that,
that
your
client
could
attack
the
new
hampshire
authority
to
accept
the
prisoners?
justice
stevens
well,
how
do
you
get
standing
to
attack
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
spend
federal
funds
in
housing
your
client?
justice
stevens
well,
but
isn't
it
arguable,
at
least,
that
you're
really
being
incarcerated
by
the
state
of
vermont
and
they
in
effect
have
entered
into
a
contract
to
have
the
federal
government
perform
that
state
function
for
them
during
a
temporary
period?
justice
stevens
but
in
the
first
question
about
vermont
and
new
hampshire,
it
seems
to
me
you're
suggesting
you
could
not
challenge
new
hampshire's
custody.
you
assert
a
right
under
18
u.s.c.
4001(a),
don't
you?
justice
stevens
the
question
is
whether
you're
being
detained
by
the
united
states,
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute,
or
whether
he
was
still
being
detained
by
vermont.
because
i
suppose
vermont
could
any
time
it
wanted
to
say
to
the
united
states,
we've
decided
to
let
this
man
go
free.
justice
stevens
so
that
who
is
the
detaining
authority?
is
it
the
state
or
the
federal
government?
justice
stevens
what's
your
normal
remedy
in
habeas?
justice
stevens
transfer?
why
wouldn't
it
be
release?
justice
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
4001(a),
the
purpose
of
that
section
must
have
been
to
give
a
citizen
who
is
detained
by
the
united
states
not
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
a
remedy.
what
else
would
4001(a)
do?
justice
stevens
well,
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
citizen
who
is
detained
by
the
united
states
not
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
ought
to
have
a
remedy
in
court
to
get
out?
justice
stevens
what?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
what
you're
telling
me
too.
because
you're
saying
these
people
were
detained
under
this
internal
security
legislation
and
this
was
to
change
that
and
give
them
a
remedy
for
it.
justice
stevens
no,
but
the
first
thing
we
look
at,
what
group
does
it
confer
a
benefit
on?
is
there
a
special
class
of
persons?
and
there
sure
is
a
special
class
defined
in
4001(a),
persons
who
are
imprisoned
except
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress,
imprisoned
by
the
united
states
without
any
act
of
congress
authorizing
it.
justice
stevens
but,
of
course,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
prior
to
1952,
when
this
statute
was
passed,
that
was
the
situation?
there
was
no
statutory
authorization
to
help
the
states
out
in
these
situations.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
executive
department
would
have
the
power
to
do
it
if
it
weren't
for
4001?
justice
stevens
could
i
interrupt
you,
just
to
go
back
to
that
question
i
asked
before?
prior
to
the
enactment
of
5003,
did
the
federal
government
ever
take
custody
of
state
prisoners,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
stevens
so
apparently
the
states
did
find
some
other
way
to
solve
these
emergency
problems,
because
i
assume
there
were
problems
from
time
to
time
where
state
facilities
got
into
trouble.
presumably
they
contracted
with
other
states,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
suggests
it
was
enacted
to
handle
the
overcrowding
problem,
is
there?
justice
stevens
well,
but,
there
is
history
that
your
opponent
cites
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
government
was
developing
special
programs
such
as
for
alcoholics
and
drug
addicts
and
youth
corrections
and
the
like.
justice
stevens
contemporaneously
with
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
the
legal
question
is,
say
we
agree
with
you,
that
it'd
be
a
very
good
idea
for
the
federal
government
to
take
over
a
large
portion
of
these
state
responsibilities,
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
authorized
it,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
that
really
isn't
quite
his
argument.
his
argument
is
that
he
has
a
right
to
stay
in
the
vermont
system
unless
the
federal
system
offers
something
that
vermont
does
not
offer
in
the
way
of
special
treatment.
justice
stevens
the
federal
government
isn't
just
going
into
the
business
of
making
their
facilities
available
on
a
wholesale
basis.
