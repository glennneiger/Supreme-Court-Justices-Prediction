mr.
william
a.
nelson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
is
a
vermont
convict
who
is
in
prison,
not
in
vermont,
but
in
the
united
states
penitentiary
in
terre
haute,
indiana.
he
challenges
his
incarceration
by
the
united
states
and
asks
his
return
to
the
custody
of
vermont.
the
case
involves
two
statutes,
two
federal
statutes,
and
turns
on
the
construction
of
one
of
them.
section
4001(a)
of
title
13
guarantees
that
no
citizen
shall
be
imprisoned
by
the
united
states
except
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress.
section
5003(a)
of
the
same
title
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
accept
custody
of
state
prisoners
when
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
certifies
that
proper
and
adequate
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
are
available.
the
question
is
the
construction
of
that
section.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
i
think
that
the
2nd
circuit's
view
is
reasonable,
that
his
incarceration
is
not
for
treatment
at
all
but
simply
for
deterrence.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
yes.
we
feel
that
the
statute
permits
inmates
to
come
into
the
federal
system
for
purposes
of
treatment.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
they
are
certainly
entitled
to
that
and
then
mr.
howe
is
their
problem.
then
mr.
howe
must
be
dealt
with
as
many
difficult
correctional
problems
must
be
dealt
with
by
the
state.
there
are
options
other
than
sending
him
to
the
federal
system.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
right.
except
for
treatment
needs.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
think
there
is
an
obligation
to
treat
him
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
a
prisoner
committed
to
state
custody
is
simply
committed
to
the
commissioner
of
corrections
or
to
the
prison
system
for
whatever
purpose
imprisonment
may
serve.
the
same
is
true
of
a
prisoner
committed
to
federal
prison.
he
is
simply
committed
to
a
penal
or
correctional
institution.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
after
a
federal
criminal
trial;
precisely.
a
state
prisoner
in
federal
prison
is
there
under
a
narrower
statute,
the
statute
at
issue
here,
one
which
permits
incarceration
when
there
are
adequate
and
proper
treatment
facilities
available.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that
would
be
because
of
section
4001
of
title
18,
which
prohibits
imprisonment
except
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress.
that
would
prohibit
imprisonment
by
executive
order
or
by
executive
arrangement,
such
as
the
contract
which
was
made
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
it's
not.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
pardon?
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
let's
look
at
the
face
of
5003.
it's
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
subsection
(a)
contains
two
clauses;
grammatically,
it's
an
independent
clause.
the
independent
clause,
as
your
honor
points
out,
permits
the
attorney
general
to
contract
with
appropriate
officials
of
a
state
for
the
custody,
care,
subsistence,
education,
treatment,
and
training
of
inmates.
that's
just
about
everything,
the
full
range
of
penological
purposes,
as
one
circuit
court
has
put
it.
that's
one
thing
that
that
section
does.
the
other
thing
it
does
is
it
limits
that
power
to
cases
where
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
certifies
that
adequate
and
proper
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
are
available.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
it
wasn't.
there
was
a
certification
that
facilities
were
available
at
federal
prisons.
we
think
there's
a
difference
between
dead
space
in
a
prison--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--well,
that's
not
the
government's
position
and
it's
not
the
state's
position,
and--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--i
don't
think
that
the
bureau...
no,
i
don't
think
it
could
be
construed
as
that.
the
bureau
did
not
intend
it
as
a
certification,
specifically,
treatment
facilities;
simply,
facilities
generally.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
justice
rehnquist,
we
agree
that
this
statute
is
talking
about
transfers
of
inmates
to
federal
prisons,
and
clearly
custody
is
involved.
the
question
is,
when
may
those
transfers
occur?
must
they
be,
may
they
be
at
any
time
for
any
purpose,
or
for
no
purpose
at
all,
as
in
an
intrastate
transfer
situation?
that's
the
respondent's
view.
our
view
is
that
it
can
occur
only
in
cases
of
treatment
needs
where
there
are
treatment
facilities
available
in
the
federal
prison
system.
our
view
is
supported
by
the
construction
placed
on
this
statute
by
the
house
committee
which
passed
it.
it
said
that
the
section
was
limited
to
inmates
with
treatment
needs.
in
the
senate
the
same
view
was
expressed,
although
perhaps
not
quite
so
clearly.
senator
mccarran,
asked
what
the
bill
would
accomplish,
said
it
would
permit
the
transfer
of
state
inmates
to
federal
prison
in
certain
circumstances
in
a
limited
category
of
cases.
neither
of
those
sources
indicates
that
this
statute
gave
the
attorney
general
a
blank
check
to
accept
any
state
inmates
for
any
purpose.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
correct.
if
i
invite
someone
to
dinner,
i
am
undertaking
to
give
him
a
table
to
eat
it
on,
a
chair
to
sit
on,
a
light
to
eat
it
by.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
i
guess
i
should
take
that
back.
i
would
undertake
to
provide
the
incidentals.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
inmates
here
are
not
invited
for
custody.
that's...
they're
invited
for
treatment.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
all
these
are
incidentals,
necessary
incidentals
to--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--we
think
that's
crucial.
we
think
that's
crucial.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
the
only
way
the
statute
could
work
is
if
it
had
something
like
the
broad
custody,
care,
subsistence,
education
clause
in
it,
otherwise
the
federal
government
would
only
be
in
charge
of
the
treatment
aspects
and
everything
else
would
be
up
in
the
air.
there
would
be
no
authorization
for
general
custody.
may
i
refer
the
court
to
another,
to
two
sections
of
the
youth
corrections
act,
sections
512
and
513
of
the
yca.
this
statute,
incidentally,
is
right
next
door
to
the
youth
corrections
act.
the
youth
corrections
act
permits
placements
of
youth
offenders
in
treatment
facilities;
precisely
the
same
language
used
in
5003(a)
is
used
in
section
512
of
the
youth
corrections
act.
it's
clear
that
5003(a)
was
modeled
after
512,
in
part,
after
512
of
the
youth
corrections
act.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
this
case
solely
concerns
the
power
of
the
federal
government
to
accept
custody.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
no,
we're
not
claiming
that.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
we
assert
a
right
not
to
be
incarcerated
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
i
don't
think
that's
arguable.
it
may
be
arguable
that--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that
statute.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
even
by...
by
contract
they
could;
yes.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
the
detaining
authority
is
the
federal
government.
he
is
clearly
under
federal
detention.
there
may
be
a
question
of
whether
he
is
in
custody
in
a
legal
sense
of
the
state
or
of
the
federal
government,
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
serious
question
that
he
is,
in
a
real
sense
in
federal
detention,
that
he
is
imprisoned
or
detained
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
in
a
legal
sense,
perhaps,
he's
in
vermont's
custody.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
yes,
i
think
in
the
sense
intended,
in
a
real
sense,
in
a
sense
intended
by
4001,
he
is
imprisoned
by
the
united
states.
the
question
is
whether
that
imprisonment
is
authorized
by
an
act
of
congress.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
we
say
it's
not.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
he's
not
demanding
freedom,
your
honor.
he's
asking
his
return
to
vermont
custody.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
no,
that's
not
true.
vermont
has
maximum
security
capacity,
for
one.
for
another
thing,
vermont
is
a
signatory
of
a
number
of
interstate
compacts,
including
the
new
england
compact.
these
compacts
permit
transfers
of
prisoners
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
and
they
do
not
mention
treatment.
they
talk
about
transfers
of
custody
for
custody
reasons.
they
do
not
condition
changes
of
custody
on
the
availability
of
treatment
facilities,
and--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--for
one
thing,
he'd
be
closer
to
home.
for
another
thing,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
really
is
whether
the
inmate
is
better
off.
he's
asking,
i'm
advocating
his
desire
to
be
returned
to
vermont
and
the
question
is
whether
he
has
a
legal
right
to
that
relief.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
it
but
he
does,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
visitation
is
a
major
consideration.
visitation
with
family
and
friends,
visitation
with
counsel.
i
have
never
met
mr.
howe.
another
consideration,
of
course,
is
the
parole
possibilities.
mr.
howe
is
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
life
imprisonment
in
vermont
is
actually
zero
to
life.
he
is
parolable,
technically,
right
now.
it's
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
work
out
any
kind
of
even
beginnings
of
a
parole
plan
from
terre
haute.
how
can--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--certainly.
and
that
would
be
available
to
the
vermont
parole
board.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
under
constitutional
restraints,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
correct.
we
see
a
clear
right
in
federal
law
against
federal
imprisonment
which
is
not
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
i
think
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
was
passed
for
inmates
with
specialized
needs,
treatment
needs.
that
it
was
limited
to
cases
of
inmates
in
need
of
treatment.
the
legislative
history
defines--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--that's
true,
that's
true.
and
we
think
that
the
language
of
of
the
statute
is
pretty
clear.
let's
play
dumb
for
a
minute,
read
"treatment
facilities
and
personnel".
what
does
that
mean?
the
core
meaning
of
that
phrase
is,
i
think,
hospitals
or
mental
institutions
of
some
sort.
i
think
that's--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--that
is...
well,
one
independent
clause
says--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--it
may
do
that,
it
may
make
federal
prison
facilities
available
when
there
are
adequate
and
proper
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
available.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
know
what
congress
meant
by
that
term.
did
it
mean,
was
that
a
euphemism
for
"prison"?
the
only
way
that
this
statute
can
be
construed
as
a
general
blanket
authorization
to
take
state
inmates
to
help
the
states
out
with
their
prison
problems,
for
whatever
reason,
is
to
read
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
as
a
euphemism
for
federal
prison.
i
think
there
are
compelling
reasons
not
to
read
it
that
way.
i
think...
as
i
said,
i
think
it
has
a
core
meaning
of
mental
hospitals,
physical
hospitals.
it
means
something
broader
than--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--pardon?
mr.
william
a.
nelson
oh,
i
think
the
words
"treatment
facilities"
in
common
speech
means,
among
other
things,
mental
hospitals
or
hospitals.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
perhaps
not.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
means--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--what
does
treatment
mean?
treatment...
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
confined
to
hospitals
and
mental--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--no,
i'm
not,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i'm
arguing
that
that's
at
least
the
core
of
its
meaning.
it
can
also
mean
other
kinds
of
therapeutic
types
of
treatment.
i
think
in
common
speech,
detoxification
programs
could
be
called
treatment
facilities,
and
alcoholism
programs
could
be
called
treatment
facilities.
and
the
people
in
charge
of
that,
of
those
programs,
could
be
called
treatment
personnel.
but
i
don't
think,
however--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--no,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
that
it's
not--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--the
record
seems
to
say,
no,
that
the
facilities
are
about
equivalent
in
both
places.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
yes,
that
the
same
types--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--pardon?
mr.
william
a.
nelson
there
is
a...
there's
a
state
hospital--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--there
is
a
state
hospital
and--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--oh,
it's
not
as
good,
i'm
sure.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
i
misinterpreted
it.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
yes.
i
would
give
up.
well,
i've
been
focusing
on
what
it
means
and
what
i
think
the
words
mean
in
common
speech.
what
don't
they...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
can
mean
prison
industries
or
other
types
of
rehabilitative
programs.
i
don't
think
that
the
man
in
charge
of
the
canvas
shop
at
terre
haute
is
a
treatment
officer,
or
that
the
officers
in
charge
of
athletic
programs
or
religious
programming
are
treatment
personnel.
that
is
a
jargon
use
of
the
phrase.
there's
another
mark
against
the
2nd
circuit's
reading.
treatment
appears
twice
in
this
statute,
first
in
the
phrase
"treatment
facilities"
and
second
in
the
list
of
items
contracted
for.
if
it
means
custody,
essentially,
in
its
appearance,
first
appearance
in
the
statute,
then
it
must
mean
something
very
different
in
the
second
appearance
in
the
statute.
in
the
second
appearance
it's
different
from
custody,
care,
subsistence,
education,
and
training.
so
the
reading
of
the
statute
that
the
respondents
propose
requires
that
treatment
be
given
two
radically
different
meanings
within
one
sentence.
and
it
requires
also
that
we
presume
congress
was
using
a
jargon
or
technical
usage
when
there
is
no
indication
that
it
was.
in
fact,
the
court,
if
it
is
of
a
mind
to,
can
read
title
18
of
the
code
from
cover
to
cover
and
not
find
a
single
instance
where
"treatment
facilities"
is
used
as
a
euphemism
for
prison,
or
as
anything
but
a
definition
of
specialized
types
of
treatment.
it
is
used
in
the
youth
corrections
act
to
define
a
type
of
commitment
different
from
ordinary
prison.
it
is
used
in
the
narcotic
addiction
rehabilitation
act
to
define
a
type
of
commitment
different
from
ordinary
prison;
therapeutic.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
perhaps.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no,
certainly
the
facilities
are
available
in
the
institution,
but
they're
not
available
to
mr.
howe.
he
hasn't
been
programmed.
the
district
court
found--
mr.
william
a.
nelson
--that's
conceivable.
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
the
government
raises
that
here
the
first
time.
it
was
never
questioned
below.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that
is
a
threshold
question,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
substantial
one.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
our
stand...
we
assert
standing
under
4001,
title
18.
"no
citizen
may
be
confined
by
the
united
states
except
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress.
"
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
these
issues
have
been
raised
by
habeas
corpus,
but
it's
habeas
not
seeking
absolute
freedom
but
seeking
a
change
in
custody.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
yes,
it
could
have
been
brought
that
way.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
it
certainly
is,
but
we
say
it
doesn't
cover
this
case.
as
we
construe
it,
it
does
not
authorize
the
transfer
of
the
prisoner
to
be
warehoused.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
no.
solely
because
of
the
phrase,
"treatment
facilities
and
personnel".
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
said,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
well,
justice
marshall,
if
we
take
the
word
"treatment"
out,
then
transfers
would
be
authorized
where
there
were
adequate
and
proper
facilities
and
personnel
available,
and
then
we
would
have
no
case.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
just
a
few
points,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
out
of
the
state?
mr.
william
a.
nelson
i
can't
point
to
anything
in
vermont
law
which
would
prohibit
that
but
i
don't
feel
confident
in
saying
that
it
would
be
authorized
either.
it
seems
fishy,
on
the
face
of
it.
it's
not...
the
statutes
which
empower
the
vermont
commissioner
of
corrections
to
incarcerate
people
speak
of
incarceration
generally
within
the
state.
a
particular
statute
was
passed
to
permit
incarceration
in
the
federal
system
as
a
reciprocal
act
to
5003.
if
vermont
were
able
without
such
a
statute
to
designate
another
agent
to
incarcerate
its
prisoners,
then
the
vermont
reciprocal
statute
would
not
have
been
necessary.
i
want
to
address
the
agency
interpretation
argument
which
was
presented
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
the
agency's
interpretation
is
entitled
to
weight
only
if
it's
reasonable.
in
this
case
we
don't
think
it's
even
reasonable.
the
circuit
reached
its
decision,
the
circuit
said
that
it
was
construing
the
statute
as
it
did,
not
quite
at
face
value.
the
district
court
reached
the
decision
it
did,
indications
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
both
of
these
sources,
as
well
as
the
context
of
other
statutes
in
which
5003
sits,
indicate
that
the
agency's
current
interpretation
is
simply
not
reasonable,
not
merely
that
it's
not
preferable.
secondly,
the
agency
interpretation
has
varied.
the
original
agency
interpretation,
after
all,
was
a
letter
submitted
to
the
judiciary
committees
of
both
house
and
senate
stating
that
federal
facilities
were
needed
for
specialized
cases,
that
there
were
requests
received
for
specialized
cases.
this,
i
think,
is
an
agency
interpretation
made
directly
to
a
house
of
congress.
the
formal
agency
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
contained
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
and
it
simply
tracks
the
statutory
language.
it
does
not
omit
the
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
requirement.
mr.
william
a.
nelson
it
could,
but
it
was,
the
deputy
attorney
general
said
that
it
mostly
related
to
juveniles,
and
i
think
he
was
referring
to
the
yca,
which
had
been
passed
in
the
previous
congress,
that
the
82nd
congress
made
the
yca
available
to
the
states,
as
well
as
other
treatment
facilities.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
