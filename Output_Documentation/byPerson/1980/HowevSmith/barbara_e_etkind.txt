ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
state
prisoner
is
ineligible
for
transfer
to
federal
custody
under
18
u.s.c.
5003
unless
he
has
a
need
for
specialized
treatment
that
is
available
in
the
federal
prison
system.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
vermont
that
section
5003
is
not
so
limited.
rather,
in
our
view,
the
statutory
requirements
are
met
and
any
state
prisoner
regardless
of
treatment
needs
may
be
transferred
from
state
to
federal
custody
once
a
contract
has
been
entered
into
between
the
state
and
federal
governments,
and
once
the
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
has
certified
that
facilities
in
federal
institutions
are
available.
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
i
shall
explain
how
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
legislative
history,
and
its
consistent
administrative
application
require
that
construction.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
vermont
will
discuss
the
state's
vital
interest
in
having
this
statute
construed
in
the
manner
we
urge.
preliminarily,
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
question,
we
would
say
that
our
certification
saying
that
facilities
in
federal
institutions
are
available
would
imply
that
treatment
facilities
are
also
available,
because
what
we
have
in
the
federal
system
are
in
fact
treatment
facilities;
they
are
available.
also,
with
respect
to
the
question
regarding
transfer
under
the
interstate
correctional
compact,
not
only
could
he
be
transferred
to
new
hampshire,
in
which
case
he
could
be
visited
more
easily,
he
could
also
be
transferred
presumably
to
colorado,
in
which
case
it
would
be
even
more
difficult
for
his
family
to
visit
him,
yet
he
would
assert
no
challenge
to
that
type
of
transfer.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
statutory
language
that
the
federal
prison
system's
authority
to
assume
custody
of
a
state
prisoner
is
conditioned
on
the
prisoner's
need
for
specialized
treatment
available
in
the
federal
system.
the
plain
language
of
section
5003(a),
as
the
court
recognizes,
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
contract
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
treatment
but
equally
for
the
purpose
of
custody,
care,
subsistence,
education,
and
training
of
state
prisoners.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
answers
to
that.
one
is
that
the
description
of
treatment
facilities
is
merely,
the
use
of
"treatment
facilities"
is
merely
a
correct
description
of
the
federal
facilities,
the
federal
prisons,
because
what
we
have
are
treatment
facilities.
to
be
sure,
other
federal
statutes
refer
to
prisons
as
penal
and
correctional
institutions,
but
those
provisions
were
passed,
not
only
were
passed
by
congresses
other
than
that
which
passed
5003,
but
they
concern
the
operation
and
management
of
federal
prisons
as
institutional
entities
rather
than
the
slots
within
them
that
may
be
available
for
the
housing
of
state
prisoners.
and
finally,
even
if
the
phrase,
5003
still
requires
no
more
than
a
certification
that
facilities
are
available,
presumably
in
the
case
that
the
prisoner
would
need
them.
but
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
suggests
that
the
director
must
make
an
individualized
determination
in
the
case
of
each
potential
state
transferee
that
he
needs
specialized
treatment
available
in
the
federal
system
and
that
specific
treatment
facilities
have
been
earmarked
for
him.
our
argument
is
not
merely
as
petitioner
misconceives
it,
that
section
5003(a)
contains
no
implied
right
of
action
in
favor
of
state
prisoners,
but
rather--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--4001?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
either
of
those.
our
argument
is
not
merely
that
there
is
no
implied
right
of
action,
but
rather
that
5003
simply
is
not
violated
by
the
transfer
of
a
state
prisoner
for--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--right.
and
while
we
would
assert
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action,
we
have
not
pressed
that
because
most
of
these
cases
have
come
up
under
habeas
and
there
certainly
would
be
a
right
if
the
petitioner
is
right
in
the
way
he
construes
the
statute,
then
there
would
be
a
remedy
in
habeas.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
transfer.
to
transfer--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no.
habeas
has
been
used
in
cases
in
which--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--the
normal
request
is
for
release,
but
it
has
been
employed
in
cases
in
which
the
prisoner
is
complaining
that
he's
in
the
wrong
place.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
in
the
wrong
place.
he
should
be
somewhere
else.
and
in
fact,
in
the
7th
circuit,
where
we
have
lost
this
issue,
the
remedy
is
that
the
court
orders
that
the
prisoner
will
be
returned
to
the
state's
authority
and
if
not
the
writ
will
issue
and
he
will
be
released.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
the
legislative
history
of
4001(a)
is
very
specific.
that
statute
was
passed
in
connection
with
the
repeal
of
the
emergency,
the
internal
security
act,
a
provision
that
allowed
citizens
to
be
rounded
up
and
detained
if
there
was
just
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
were
engaged
in
some
sort
of
illegal
activity
without
conviction.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
quite
clear
that
4001
was
enacted
in
order
to
provide
that
citizens
would
not
have
to
be
afraid
of
that.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
what
petitioner
is
saying.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
what
the
petitioner--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
but
when
we
look
to
see
whether
a
private
right
of
action
is
available
we
look
at
more
than
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
except
that
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
the
persons
for
whom
they
were
concerned
and
to
whom
they
wanted
to
give
a
right
of
action
were
those
that
were
being
detained
without
conviction
only
upon
a
probable
cause
of
engaging
in
some
sort
of
illegal
activity.
we've
addressed
that
in
our
brief,
i
believe
it's
page
25,
note
13.
section
5003
does
not
provide,
as
petitioner
would
have
it,
that
no
state
prisoner
may
be
transferred
to
the
federal
prison
system
unless
the
director
certifies
that
he
is
in
need
of
specialized
treatment
available
in
the
federal
system.
rather,
the
only
condition
imposed
under
section
5003(a)'s
broad
authority
to
contract,
apart
from
the
reimbursement
requirement,
is
that
the
director
have
certified
that
proper
and
adequate
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
are
available.
that
certification
nowhere
requires
that
an
individualized
determination
of
treatment
need
and
available
federal
resources
be
made
with
respect
to
each
potential
state
transferee.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
a
much
closer
question
and
i
think
in
that
case
there
might
be
an
expectation
created
by
state
law.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
did
not
use
that.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
to
go
to
the
legislative
history,
what
congress's
basic
underlying
motive,
intent,
was,
was
to
match
the
needs
of
the
states
with
the
surpluses
of
the
federal
government,
whatever
they
might
be
at
that
time.
the
requests
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
had
been
getting
was
for
space
in
the
federal
system
for
juveniles
and
for
drug
addicts,
and
we
had
that
space
available
and
so
we
determined
to
make
that
available.
but
in
a
gross
sense
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
limit
it
in
that
way,
it
was
just
to
make
what
we
had
available
to
the
states.
although
we
view
the
statutory
language
as
unambiguous
resort
to
the
legislative
history
demonstrates,
as
i
said,
that
the
intent
was
to
match
the
states'
needs
with
federal
surpluses.
the
petitioner's
construction
would
frustrate
that
intent
by
preventing
the
federal
government,
even
when
it
has
the
necessary
surpluses,
from
meeting
the
urgent
needs
of
the
state
correctional
system.
the
bureau's
construction
of
section
5003
has
permitted
it
to
accept
custody
of
nearly
172
new
mexico
prisoners
who
were
displaced
by
the
massive
disruption
in
that
state's
penitentiary
on
february
2
and
3,
1980.
similarly,
pursuant
to
its
broad
construction
of
section
5003,
the
bureau
assumed
custody
of
111
idaho
state
prisoners
after
riots
occurred
in
that
state's
maximum
security
facility
on
july
23,
1980.
and
more
recently,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
ordered
the
maryland
prison
system
to
transfer
100
of
its
inmates
to
the
federal
system
in
order
to
partially
relieve
the
state
system's
overcrowding
problem.
none
of
those
emergency
relocations
would
be
possible
under
petitioner's
cramped
construction
of
the
statute,
nor
would
the
federal
system
be
authorized
to
afford
protective
custody
to
a
state
prisoner
who
was
in
danger
from
his
fellow
state
inmates
or
to
accept
custody
of
any
state
prisoner
regardless
of
how
much
he
could
benefit
from
or
indeed
desires
certain
aspects
of
federal
incarceration,
unless
such
a
prisoner
was
otherwise
in
need
of
specialized
treatment
available
in
the
federal
system.
as
the
court
below
put
it,
adopting
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
would
mean
that
a
wholly
incorrigible
prisoner
or
on
the
other
hand
a
fully
rehabilitated
prisoner
incarcerated
not
for
treatment
but
solely
for
purposes
of
deterrence
could
not
be
transferred
from
state
to
federal
custody
solely
to
take
advantage
of
training
and
educational
opportunities
available
only
at
federal
facilities.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
at
that
time
the
executive
branch
could
have
entered
into
those
contracts
with
the
states
because
4001
was
not
passed
until
1971,
so
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
anything
to
stop
the
federal
government
from
doing
it.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes,
i
believe
so.
i
don't
think
it
needs
5003
except
for
4001.
vermont
certainly
is
not
unique
among
the
states
in
its
need
for
maximum
security
or
other
facilities
for
its
offenders.
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
severe
overcrowding
problems
in
state
and
local
penal
institutions
generally.
as
of
mid-december,
1980,
however--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i
don't
know.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that
may
have
been,
but
i
also
think
that
the
overcrowding
problems
that
the
states
have
been
having
have
been
escalating;
i
don't
know
at
what
stage
they
were--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--no,
there
isn't
specifically,
but
as
i
mentioned
before,
i
think
the
gist
of
it
is
that
if
the
federal
government
has
a
surplus
and
a
state
has
a
need,
then
those
should
be
matched.
certainly,
the
congress--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--oh,
we
had
that.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
indicate
that
we
were
developing
them
at
that
time.
i
think
it
indicates
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
we
had
them
at
those
times.
as
of
mid-december,
1980,
the
entire
federal
system
was
slightly
short
of
its
rated
physical
capacity.
and
to
the
extent
that
such
surplus
federal
facilities
can
be
used
to
alleviate
the
state's
problems,
be
they
lack
of
maximum
security
facilities,
lack
of
treatment
programs,
or
overcrowding
in
general,
we
submit
that
the
purposes
of
18
u.s.c.
5003
would
be
furthered.
and
this
shows
that
from
the
enactment
of
section
5003
to
the
present,
the
bureau
of
prisons
consistently
has
maintained
the
view
that
we
urge
here,
that
there
are
no
limitations
on
the
purposes
for
which
state
prisoners
may
be
transferred
to
the
federal
system,
that
simple
custody
is
a
sufficient
reason.
indeed,
in
its
first
annual
report
after
the
passage
of
section
5003
in
1952,
the
bureau
suggested
as
examples
of
situations
in
which
the
transfer
provision
might
be
employed,
those
in
which
"a
state
may
wish
to
transfer
a
vicious,
intractable
offender
who
cannot
be
handled
readily
in
its
own
institutions,
or
a
female
prisoner
for
whom
appropriate
facilities
are
not
available.
"
we
submit
that
considerable
deference
is
due
such
a
contemporaneous
and
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
agency
that
drafted
the
legislation,
suggested
its
enactment
to
congress,
and
has
been
charged
with
its
administration
ever
since.
i'd
like
to
rely
on
our
arguments
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
second
two
points,
unless
there
are
any
questions
from
the
court.
thank
you.
