justice
rehnquist
what
was
mr.
howe
convicted
of?
justice
rehnquist
and
do
you
have
any
answer
of
your
own
as
to
what
would
be
the
proper
and
suitable
correctional
treatment
for
him?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think...
in
other
words,
you
think
that
it
must
be
treatment
of
some
sort?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
vermont
penal
authorities
decide
that
no
amount
of
treatment
can
ever
rehabilitate
this
person,
that
he's
simply
got
to
be
locked
up
for
a
good
long
time
in
order
to
keep
him
from
doing
it
again.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
federal
system
has
no
right
to
receive
him
under
these
circumstances.
justice
rehnquist
looking
at
the
same
subsection
(a)
that
you've
just
been
reading
from,
the
attorney
general
may,
"is
hereby
authorized
to
contract
with
the
proper
officials
of
a
state
or
a
territory
for
the
custody.
"
of
a
person
"when
the
director
shall
certify
that
proper
and
adequate
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
are
available.
"
now,
if
you
contract
for
the
custody
of
a
person,
it
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
trained
personnel
other
than
guards,
does
it?
justice
rehnquist
the
language
of
subsection
(a)
does
outline
the
purposes
for
which
the
attorney
general
may
receive
them
and
it's
custody,
care,
subsistence,
education,
treatment,
and
training.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
reading
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
particularly
phrased
in
the...
with
the
"and"
as
it
is,
would
include
custody
as
a
separate
facet.
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
almost
a
case
of
damnum
absque
injuria,
as
we
learned
in
law
school?
if
he
gets
out
of
the
federal
prison
he's
going
to
go
back
to
a
minimum
security
in
vermont
because
the
vermont
legislature
doesn't
want
to
appropriate
the
funds
for
a
maximum
security?
justice
rehnquist
why
is
your
client
going
to
be
better
off
being
imprisoned
in
the
state
penitentiary
in
new
hampshire
than
he
is
in
the
federal
penitentiary
at
terre
haute?
justice
rehnquist
well,
he
wouldn't
be
seeing
much
of
vermont,
would
he?
does
the
record
show
whether
he
has
relatives
in
vermont?
justice
rehnquist
but
why
then
does
the
statute
require
that
the
director
shall
certify
that
proper
and
adequate
treatment
facilities
and
personnel
be
available?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
easton,
i
take
it
nobody
disputes
the
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit
that
vermont,
as
contemplated
in
the
agreement
in
1975,
closed
its
only
maximum
security
prison?
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
extend
also
to
some
of
your
educational
facilities?
doesn't
vermont
have
an
agreement
with
maine
that
vermont
law
students
can
go
to
maine,
the
university
of
maine
law
school,
whereas
university
of
maine
residents
can
go
to
the
university
of
vermont'
medical
school?
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
not
state-sponsored.
justice
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
special
cases
mean
alcatraz?
