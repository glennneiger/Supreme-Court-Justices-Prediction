mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
simple.
the
petitioner,
united
parcel
service,
was
charged
with
having
discharged
unfairly
an
employee,
who
was
charged
with
having
falsified
his
timecard
and
claiming
payment
for
time
that
he
did
not
work.
his
union
took
his
case
through
the
grievance
procedure,
all
the
way
to
arbitration
before
a
joint
panel,
regularly
constituted,
which,
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
issues
awards
which
are
final
and
binding.
seventeen
months
later,
mitchell,
the
plaintiff,
sued
united
parcel
service
and
the
union
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
seeking
reinstatement
and
back
pay,
charging
that
the
union
had
failed
to
represent
him
fairly
in
the
arbitration
proceedings.
both
parties
moved
to
dismiss,
the
district
court
did
dismiss,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
and
held
unlike
the
district
court
which
says
that
a
statute
of
limitations
of
90
days
which
applied
to
actions
to
vacate
arbitration
awards,
does
not
apply...
but
rather,
the
regular
statute
of
limitations
applying
to
contract
claims
did
apply.
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
then
filed
by
the
employer
only.
it
involved--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--the
union
did
not
file.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
would
suppose
that
the
judgment
stands
and
that
the
case
would
be
remanded
unless
this
court
were
to
order
otherwise,
which
on
occasion
it
has
done,
but
very
rarely.
the--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--it
is
a
party
to
the
case.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
is
a
respondent
in
the
case,
just
as
it
has
been.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
has
done
so,
we
have
been
in
consultation
with
the
union
and
while
i
am
not
here
to
argue
its
cause,
if
the
court
should
have
any
questions
i
would
endeavor
to
answer
them.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
if
we
prevailed,
it
would
be
up
to
this
court
and
there
have
been
differences
on
this
court,
as
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
know,
quite
recently
on
this
kind
of
issue,
on
whether
they
are
divisible,
whether
they
should
be
divisible,
whether
the
court
should,
itself,
ordain
a
rule,
if
it
were
finally
to
get
around
to
what
the
dissenters
most
recently
said
i
guess,
in
the
occidental
case.
then
my
guess
is,
it
would
apply
it
to
both.
otherwise,
the
plaintiff
would
be
out
by
virtue
of
the
90
day
statute
of
limitations;
as
to
us,
it
would
go
back
on
a
remand
as
to
the
union.
while
the
petition
was
pending
the
third
circuit
decided
the
liotta
case,
which
was
really
on
all
fours
with
what
the
district
court
did...
held
that
a
90
day
statute
in
these
very
facts
would
apply.
the
case
has
very
real
significance,
very
important
significance
in
labor
management
relations
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
potential
impact
may
best
be
seen,
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
with
its
almost
two
million
members
and
its
80
to
100
thousand
collective
bargaining
agreements,
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
and
that
the
afl-cio
with
its
15
and
1/2
million
members
has
likewise
filed
a
brief,
taking
very
strong
positions.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
but
different.
quite
different.
but
both
of
which
would
have
the
plaintiff
out
of
this
court.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
and
the
union,
correct.
i
start
with
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
long
favored
arbitration
as
a
fair,
fast
and
final--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--yes,
mister--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--this
was
an
arbitration
in
terms
of
our
agreement
with
the--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--and
it
was
the
end
of
the
line,--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--this
court
has
expressly
stated
that
a
joint
panel
decision
is
an
arbitration
award.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
it
was...
justice
brennan,
it
was
in
a
railway
labor
act,
it
was
in
a
seaman's
case
and
i
have
a
vague
recollection
that
it
was
in
a
teamster
case,
but
i'm
not
sure.
however,
no
one
has
ever
questioned
that,
the
conclusiveness
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
makes
it
very
clear
that
that
is
as
final
and
binding
as
if
it
went
to
arbitration.
in
1960,
this
court
decided
the
landmark
trilogy
of
steelworkers
cases.
and
that
contains
of
course,
the
leading
statement
that
the
role
of
the
courts
must
be
to
encourage
arbitration
of
disputes
in
labor
management
negotiations...
and
not
to
substitute
their
views
on
the
merits
of
contract
claims
for
the
views
of
the
arbitrators.
and
that's
been
emphasized
throughout
and
we
think
that
is
important
in
this
case.
hines
v.
anchor
motor
freight
established
that
section
301
actions
might
be
brought
against
an
employer
and
a
union,
although
the
alleged
breach
was
by
arbitration;
that
was
the
first
case
and
that's
why
i
mentioned
it.
but
i
might
say
that
no
statute
of
limitations
was
involved
in
the
hines
case,
and
i
think
anyone
who
reads
the
case
would
feel
that
if
there
were
a
statute
it
would
have
been
tolled
by
virtue
of
the
really
monstrous
facts
there:
an
employee
having
been
found
guilty,
when
two
years
later
a
clerk
in
a
motel
admitted
that
he
had
stolen
the
money
and
not
the
employee.
now,
then
came
hoosier
and
i
think
that's
about
the
last
case
i
want
to
mention,
because
that's
a
case
which
although
involving
neither
arbitration
nor
conduct
that
would
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice,
did
opt
to
look
to
the
state
for
the
appropriate
limitation
period.
i
mention
it
only
because
it
was
the
first
case
and
following
the
procedure
mandated
by
hoosier,
that's
what
was
done
here,
on
the
authority
of
that
case.
mitchell's
claim
was
a
suit,
we
maintain,
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award,
to
say
that
if
the
arbitration
award
was
still
outstanding
and
as
final
and
binding
as
indeed
it
is,
mitchell
would
simply
have
no
cause
of
action.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
1960.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
but
hines'
real
significance,
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
is
it
was
the
first
case
where
an
arbitration
was
gone
into
and
overturned.
the
sanctity
of
arbitration...
there
were
a
lot
of
articles
at
the
time;
whether
that
was
going
to
be
seriously
affected
but
it
wasn't
and
i
think
the
reason
it
wasn't
is
that
as
i
say,
if
the
issue
had
been
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
would
have
definitely
been
tolled
under
those
facts.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
hoosier?
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
hoosier
did
not.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
it
involved
neither
arbitration
nor
conduct
that
would
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
is--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--right,
precisely.
now,
prior
to
this
case,
every
district
court
in
the
country
that
had
tried
the
issue,
and
i
think
it's
significant
because
they
know
right
at
the
scene
of
the
action
how
important
arbitration
and
the
sanctity
and
the
continuance
of
arbitration
instead
of
strikes,
is;
every
one
of
them,
except
the
court
that
was
reversed
in
the
liotta
case,
over
the
years,
has
decided
on
a
90-day
statute
of
limitations
and
has
decided
that
any
such
attacks,
are
attacks
on
the
award
unless
you
get
rid
of
the
award...
you
simply
can't
proceed
any
further.
it
stands
as
an
absolute
bar.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
90-day
is
the
new
york
statute--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--applying
to
arbitration.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
your
honor,
around
the
country,
there
are
42--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--statutes,
and
37
of
them
are--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--for
90
days
or
less.
now
three
of
them
are
for
the
term
of
court--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--there's
only
one
statute
that's
a
year.
everybody
else
is
90
days,
except
for
one
for
100
days.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
five...
wait
a
minute,
i
think
there
are
five;
it's
three
or
five.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well,
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
if
i
may.
i
just
want
to
point
out
the
plaintiff's
position
here.
the
plaintiff's
position
has
now
shifted
somewhat,
from
the
6-year
statute
that
he
tried
in
the
courts
below
to
a
three-year
statute
which
he
takes
the
position,
would
apply
to
the
union
but
not
the
employer,
because
it
involves
malpractice
for
instance
and
that
can't
apply
to
the
employer
and
so
on.
then
he
takes
the
position
that
if
the
united
parcel
were
the
plaintiff
in
a
section
301
action,
only
a
90-day
statute
would
apply.
but
somehow
if
it
becomes
the
defendant
a
six-year
contract
statute
applies.
and
that
is
the
situation
in
which
we
now
find
ourselves.
now
i
think
it's
significant
that
even
the
court
below
and
the
only
other
court
that
refused
to
apply
a
90-day
statute
of
limitations,
the
sixth
circuit,
said
and
i
quote
them:
that
the
effect
of
a
judgment
for
the
discharged
employee...
i
substituted
the
words
discharged
employee...
the
effect
of
a
judgment
for
the
discharged
employee
would
be
to
nullify
the
arbitral
decision.
that's
the
precise
language
quoted
by
both
those
courts;
the
only
two
that
have
opted
for
a
longer
statute.
i
think
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
was
in
focussing
on
the
underlying
claim
rather
than
the
relief
sought,
and
said
the
underlying
claim
is
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
since
that's
a
contract,
why
we
move
right
over
to
that
word
contract
in
the
six-year
statute.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
it
comes
a
little
curiously,
because
the
very
day
after
the
arbitration
had
been
submitted,
just
in
passing
i
might
say,
the
plaintiff
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
of
the
teamsters,
joe...
joe
purcell
and
donald
mason...
business
agents
for
the
local,
have
done
a
tremendous
job
in
my
behalf,
however,
because
of
the
company's
unreasonable
position,
i
have
been
compelled
to
hire
an
attorney
to
protect
my
civil
rights.
and
i
might
say,
he
hired
that
attorney
the
day
of
the
arbitration
award.
there
was
no
hardship
here,
to
a
90-day,
if
he'd
gone
ahead
with
it.
but
he
waited
for
some
reason
for
17
more
months
and
then
changed
his
position
that
the
union
had
not
given
him
a
faithful
representation.
we
believe--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--the
90-day
statute
now,
it
happens--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--90-day
arbitration
award--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--the
90-day
statute.
the
district
court's...
justice
white.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes.
but
i
would
say
that--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--it's
very
unusual
for
them
not
to
include
the
employer
as
a
favorite
target.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
particularly...
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
so
we
feel
that
having
failed
to
file
this
action
under
the
90-day
statute
that
he
just
isn't
in
this
court.
we
believe
that...
i
started
to
say,
about
the
substantive
claim...
the
reason
i
believe
that
that's
a
flaw
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court
is
that
every
arbitration
has
an
underlying
claim
and
if
you're
not
going
to
worry
about
procedure
at
all
and
you're
going
to
look
at
the
underlying
claim,
then
there
is
no
arbitration
really,
involving
an
employee
that
doesn't
have
an
underlying
claim
of
contract.
so
all
these
decisions
would
have
to
be
no-no.
they
now
go
to
the
contract
5
or
6
years,
in
virtually
all
the
states,
and
the
fact
that
there
was
an
arbitration
is
just
washed
out.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
that
ever
happened,
we'd
go
back
to
strikes
in
place
of
arbitration
in
the
solution
of
industrial
disputes
in
this
country.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
only
that
takes
a
little
while,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
have
found
in
my
experience.
and--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--yes,
that's...
i
should
say
that
usually
takes
a
little
while.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
there's
a
lot
of...
briefs--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--the
10(b)
and
that
of
course
would
involve
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
there's
a
little
difficulty
in
applying
that
to
the
employer.
and
you
run
into
a
whole
gamut
of
reasoning,
i
would
say
that
frankly
if
the
court
and
the
federal
government
generally
were
to
want
leave
the
multiplicity,
as
you,
mr.
justice
white,
urged
way
back
in
hoosier,
of
50
states,
that
probably
that
would
be
the
best
place
to
go.
some
people
think
the
best
place
to
go
would
be,
to
use
the
analogy...
for
this
court
to
use
the
analogy
of
the
u.s.
arbitration
statute,
often
called
the
federal
arbitration
statute
which
has
a
90-day.
everybody
who
has
opted,
as
i
say,
it
isn't
only
the
district
courts,
it
isn't
only
the
legislatures,
but
the
congress
has
opted
for
90
days.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
exactly
it.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
precisely
the
reasoning
and
there's
a
great
amount
of
support
in
logic,
and
in
labor
management
practice
for
that
view.
i
certainly
don't
decry
it.
we're
here
on
a
petition
asking
for
the
90-day,
but
i
would
scarcely
leave
in
mourning
if
the
court
opted
for
the
six
months.
and
i
think,
more
importantly,
labor
and
management,
preferring
the
shortest
possible
period
that's
fair
and
90
days,
federal
and
state,
has
been
regarded
as
a
fair
time.
now--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--mr.
chief
justice,
half
my
professional
life
has
been
in
the
field
of
labor
relations.
and
as
a
former
associate,
sometime
opponent,
sitting
on
the
bench
knows,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
that
if
we
go
to
a
six
year,
labor
management
relations
become
impractical
in
america.
we're
talking
here
about
a
discharge.
we
have
contracts
that
are
1,
2
or
3
years
of
duration.
it
would
mean
that
when
you
sit
down
to
negotiate
a
contract
out
there,
forget
discharges...
you
have
serious
arbitrations
on
seniority
rights,
what
are
the
seniority
rights...
on
meanings
of
clauses,
this
point
is
made
very
well
in
the
teamster's
brief,
and
likewise
in
the
afl-cio
brief.
you
would
have
chaos
in
labor
relations
if
we
had
to
sit
around
in
labor
management
relations
for
the
first
time
six
years,
so
that
when
you
come
to
a
one-year
contract
you've
got
five
years
of
arbitration
outstanding
where
you're
not
sure
of
whether
what
the
arbitrator
said
a
contract
means
in
broad,
important
means,
whether
that
will
hold
or
won't
hold.
so
that
its
impact
is
very
large
indeed.
now,
there's
a
small
point
i'll
just
mention
in
passing,
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
in
error
in
holding
that
mitchell
had
no
standing
to
sue
under
new
york
state
law.
he
lost
sight
of
the
case
of
vaca
v.
sipes,
decided
by
this
court;
there
was
an
appellate
division
case
too,
it's
taken
up
fully
in
our
brief,
and
i
mention
it
only
in
passing.
but
the
court,
curiously,
and
i
must
say
with
the
greatest
of
deference
to
the
bench,
which
i
hold
in
high
regard,
that
i
cannot
understand
the
court's
emphasis
on
the
unfairness
of
a
90-day
statute.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
though
it
was
a
misprint,
most
frankly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
reread
the
opinion
so
that
it
is...
i
do
not
understand
that,
and
i
do
not
understand
how,
as
i
say
with
the
greatest
of
deference,
three
judges
sitting
in
conference
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
every
legislature
that
has
acted
has
decided
6-5-4-3-2,
all
are
too
long,
but
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
so
decided
that
every
one
of
the
district
courts
that
decided
the
case,
other
than
the
liotta,
were
reversed,
would
sit
there
and
bemoan
the
unfairness
to
employees
of
a
90-day
statute
and
yet,
that
is
a
major
factor
in
its
opinion.
it
has
this
fact
i
just
mentioned,
the
lack
of
standing
which
is
certainly
erroneous,
it
has
that
this
would
be
basically
unfair
and
what
it's
saying
is
that
the
policy
of
labor
management
relations
in
america
is
basically
unfair,
that
what
unions
and
management
want
is
basically
unfair.
that
what
the
legislatures
of
the
country
have
virtually
unanimously
opted
for
is
unfair;
that
what
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
in
at
least
three
statutes,
90
days
is
unfair.
if
it
just
upped
the
statutory
interpretation,
i'd
say,
well
it's
an
error.
it's
an
erroneous
statutory
interpretation
because
of
forgetting
this
underlying
basis...
theory
and
being
misled
by
it.
this
leaves
me,
as
the
sentence
that
you
quoted,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
nonplussed.
now,
i
point
out
to
this
court
that
apart
from
the
unfairness,
just
being--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--well
we
think
it
should
have
a
section
301
suit
to
test
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
within
90
days,
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
well
then
you
have
the
tolling
of
the
statute.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
yes,
and
incidentally
so
does
the
federal
statute,
so
does
the...
uniform
act.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
a
right
which
a
plaintiff
has
absent
statutory
provisions
for
tolling;
that
if
you
can
demonstrate
fraud
or
misconduct...
but
it
does
have
it
there,
because
it
says
that
you
can
set
aside
the
award
in
three
contingencies,
one
is
misconduct.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
no,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
in
such
a
case,
mr.
justice
stevens,
you
weigh
the
public
considerations
and
the
public
consideration
for
the
90-day
as
opposed
to
a
six-year
labor
management
relation,
is
so
much
greater
than
the
situation
of
the
employee
who
sits
on
his
rights...
if
he
doesn't
sit
on
his
rights
in
the
first
place,
most
arbitral
boards
have
shown
that
they
will
reconsider
the
matter.
there
is
nothing
that
is...
these
are
managements
and
labor
representatives
and
they're
not
heartless,
so
we
can
assume
that
if
it
went
to
them
they
would...
this
is
a
situation
where
a
man
just
left
his
job
where
7
supervisors...
and
each
filed
statements
that
they
saw
him
leave
and
he
doctored
up
his
record.
well
in
this
case,
i
would
say
the
90
days
is
a
good
rule.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
that's
precisely...
well,
i
don't
know,
the
facts
aren't
that
clear
five
and
a
half
years
later.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
the
supervisors
are
gone,
things
have
changed.
well,
i
want
to
leave
myself
some
time--
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
--yes.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
i
read
that,
and
i
thought
it
was
just
trying
to
leave
the
door
open
in
a
kind
of
excessive
question;
that's
how
i
read
it.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
oh,
yes
but
the
court
had
no
facts
before
it,
it
didn't
know
what
the
mexican
statute
provided
for
and
neither
do
i.
so
that,
your
honors,
as
i
leave
you
with
the
fact
that
what
the
plaintiff
seeks
here
is
precisely
what
he
sought
in
the
arbitration
award,
before
the
arbitration
panel,
his
objective
is
the
same,
his
motive
is
the
same
and
unless
he
gets
rid
of
that,
he
cannot
prevail
and
he's
too
late
to
get
rid
of
that.
mr.
bernard
g.
segal
nothing,
if
it
please
the
court.
