involved,
as
i
remember,
a
claim
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
under
section
301.
not...
it
didn't
involve
arbitration,
did
it?
justice
stewart
hoosier.
justice
stewart
no.
it
was
a
claim...
under
301.
justice
stewart
right,
merely
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
stewart
is
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
part
of
the
union?
justice
stewart
there's
no
1983
claim,
because--
justice
stewart
--it
has
to
be
under
color
of
state
law.
justice
stewart
no,
it
couldn't.
justice
stewart
well
my
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
was
prompted
by
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
afl
cio,
which
suggests
that
the
proper
statute
of
limitations
is
that
supplied
by
section
10(b)
of
the
labor
act.
justice
stewart
a
six
month
statute.
justice
stewart
--it's
not
available
in
a
legal
action
when
there's
a
statute
of
limitations,
as
my
brother
marshall
suggests.
