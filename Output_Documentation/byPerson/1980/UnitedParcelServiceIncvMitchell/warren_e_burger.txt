you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

well
are
you
saying
that
this
is
in
substance,
mr.
segal,
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
by
the
union?
but
described
in
some
other
terms
in
the
complaint?
chief
justice
burger
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
segal,
in
terms
of
corporate
accounting
purposes,
perhaps
requirements
of
the
sec,
on
every
discharge
case
would
the...
either
good
practice
or
sec
demands
require
that
the
corporation
set
up
a
contingency
reserve
for
a
suit
that
might
come

11
months
afterward?

warren
e.
burger
mr.
jaroslawicz.
chief
justice

isn't
that
the...
doesn't
that
permeate
the
whole
structure
of
federal
law
on
industrial
relations,
to
resolve
matters
as
quickly
as
possible?
chief
justice
burger
you
think
it
contributes
to
the...
what
permeates
the
whole
industrial
relations
statutory
structure,
to
allow
the
employee
to
wait
five
years
and
11
months
and
then
bring
a
lawsuit
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean,
applying
a
laches
doctrine
against
him?
chief
justice
burger
in
the
face
of
a
six
year
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.

you
have
anything
further,
mr.
