justice
marshall
isn't
there
a
brand
new
law,
statute
of
limitations?
isn't
there
a
brand
new
one,
because
right
after
this
i'm
going
to
ask
you
to
give
me
a
case.
justice
marshall
i
thought
that
the
statute
of
limitations
meant
if
you
filed
it
within
the
period
of
20
years
it's
under
the
statute
and
you
don't
have
to
explain
to
anybody
under
any
circumstances,
am
i
right?
justice
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
marshall
so
where'd
you
get
laches
in
there?
justice
marshall
give
me
a
case
on
that.
justice
marshall
no,
cite
me
one,
cite
me
one.
justice
marshall
i'll
even
take
a
justice
of
the
peace
case.
justice
marshall
this
is
a
arbitrator-judge...
what
is
this
you
called
this
man?
justice
marshall
i'm
talking
about
a
judge-judge.
that's
the
one
that
deals
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
right?
now
give
me
a
judge
who
said
that
although
you
were
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
i'm
going
to
say
you
are
too
late.
justice
marshall
i
don't
think
you
can.
laches
is
purely
an
equitable--
