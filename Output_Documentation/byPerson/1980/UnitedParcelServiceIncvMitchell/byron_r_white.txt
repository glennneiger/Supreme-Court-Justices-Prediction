justice
white
well
the
union
remains
a
party
to
the
case
though?
justice
white
it's
a
respondent,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well
isn't
it
entitled
to
file
a
brief
for
or
against
the
judgment
below?
justice
white
and
the
union?
justice
white
well
if
we
applied
that
same
notion
to
joint
board
decisions--
justice
white
--this
wasn't
arbitration?
justice
white
well,
it
was
the
end
of
the
line,
and--
justice
white
--but
there
was
not
an
independent
arbitrator?
justice
white
well
wasn't
hoosier
some
time
before?
justice
white
so
it
was
before
hines,
a
good
deal
before
hines?
justice
white
well
mr.
segal,
the
90-day...
what's
the
source
of
the
90-day--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
but
you're
saying,
every
district
court
around
the
country,
they
were
applying
their
own
state
statutes,
i
take
it--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
anyway,
anyway,
they
applied
a
statute
that
relates
to
overturning
arbitration
agreements?
justice
white
mr.
segal,
what
statute
of
limitations
usually
applies
around
the
country
to
claims
of
unfair
representation,
just
against
the
union?
suppose
this
suit
had
been
filed
only
against
the
union,--
justice
white
--well,
it's...
he
wouldn't
be...
have
they
applied
that
90-day--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
so
they've
applied,
whether
they
are
suing
the
union
alone
or
with
the
employer?
justice
white
and
what
if
there's
only--
justice
white
mr.
segal,
have
any
of
the...
have
any
suggestions
ever
cropped
up
in
any
of
these
cases
before,
that
congress
has
already
enacted
a
statute
to--
justice
white
--the
suggestion
is,
in
this
case,
that
congress
has
already
adopted
the
statute,
10(b).
justice
white
well
isn't
the
theory
under
10(b)
is
that
as
applied
to
a
case
like
this,
that
if
you
want
to
reopen
the
result
of
a
collective
bargaining
procedure,
you
should
do
so
within
six
months?
justice
white
and
that
this
is
collective
bargaining?
