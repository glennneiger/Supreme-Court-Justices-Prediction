but
they
all
borrow,
don't
they,
each
district
court
borrows
the
appropriate
state
statutes?
justice
rehnquist
--particularly
after
hines
v.
anchor
motor
freight.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
segal,
turning
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
this
case,
the
sentence
on
page
813,
where
it
says
applying
the
6-year
limitation
period
of
213(2)
provides
for
relatively
rapid
disposition
of
labor
disputes
without
undermining
the
employees
ability
to
vindicate
his
rights
through
301
actions.
do
you
understand
that?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
is
it
if
those
two
events
occur;
that
the
union
sells
him
out
and
he
then
has
a
forum
in
the
courthouse,
what
is
the
nature
of
his
action,
what
is
it
for
and
what
statute
of
limitations
is
it
governed
by?
justice
rehnquist
but
united
parcel
service
isn't
a
state
agency,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
not
a
contract
action,
which
is
traditionally
governed
by
a
statute
of
limitations
it's
an
equitable
action
that's
governed
by
laches.
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
either
one
of
the
two
that
you
mention
is
the
sort
of
thing
that's
governed
by
a
traditional
statute
of
limitations
and
not
by
any
doctrine
of
laches,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
assumes
you're
in
court,
that
you
have
passed
the
statute
of
limitations
bar
and
now
you're
talking
about
damages.
justice
rehnquist
would
you
agree
with
judge
timbers'
statement
in
the...
for
the
second
circuit
that
six
years
is
not...
is
a
relatively
rapid
disposition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
second
of
the
two
cases,
united
parcel
service
versus
mitchell,
the
respondent
was
employed
by
petitioner
united
parcel
service
which
fired
him
for
falsifying
timecards
and
claiming
payment
for
hours
he
did
not
work.
respondent's
union
and
ups
were
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
provided
a
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
for
the
resolution
of
disputes
covered
by
the
agreement,
and
respondent
requested
his
union
to
invoke
the
procedure
on
his
behalf
in
order
to
contest
his
discharge.
the
respondent,
the
employee's
claim
was
eventually
submitted
to
a
joint
employee
union
arbitration
panel
which
upheld
the
discharge.
seventeen
months
later,
respondent
filed
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court
against
the
union
and
united
parcel
service
alleging
that
the
discharge
was
in
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
union
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
when
it
represented
his
case
to
the
joint
arbitration
panel.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
dismissed
the
suit,
ruling
that
it
was
barred
by
the
90-day
new
york
statute
of
limitations
for
actions
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
hold
--
ruling
that
the
court
should
have
been
said
--
used
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
in
new
york
for
actions
for
breach
of
contract.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
and
reversed
the
second
circuit.
since
no
statute
of
limitations
is
provided
by
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
under
which
respondent
brought
his
suit,
we
must
borrow
the
most
closely
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations.
we
think
respondent's
suit
is
more
closely
analogous
to
an
action
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award
than
it
is
to
an
action
for
breach
of
contract.
respondent's
suit
in
federal
court
raise
the
same
claim
as
he
raise
before
the
arbitration
panel
and
it
sought
the
same
relief.
the
predicate
for
how
a
respondent's
federal
court
suit
against
his
employer
is
not
simply
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
under
our
decision
in
hines
against
anchor
motor
freight
a
breach
by
the
union
of
its
duty
a
fair
representation.
furthermore,
labor
dispute
should
be
resolved
as
quickly
as
possible
and
this
policy
makes
borrowing
the
90-day
limitation
period
for
actions
where
it
is
analogous
to
the
action
brought
more
appropriate
than
borrowing
the
six-year
period
for
contract
actions
keeping
labor
disputes
open
for
as
long
as
six
years
undermines
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
through
which
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
given
meaning.

blackman
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
stewart

the
result
