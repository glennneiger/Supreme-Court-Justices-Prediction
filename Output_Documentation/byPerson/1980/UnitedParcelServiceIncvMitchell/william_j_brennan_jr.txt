justice
jr.
well
mr.
segal,
if
you
prevailed,
what
would
be
the
status
of
the
case
against
you?
justice
jr.
but
different?
justice
jr.
wasn't
that
in
the
railway
labor
act
context
though,
mr.
segal?
justice
jr.
how
many
statutes
are
less
than
90
days,
mr.
segal?
justice
jr.
well
there's
no
point
made
anyway
that
the
90
days
is
too
short?
justice
jr.
may
i
just
ask
one
question,
mr.
segal?
justice
jr.
you
recall
that
in
hoosier,
there's
a
footnote
on
this,
footnote
9...
what
do
you
suppose
that
means?
other
questions
would
be
raised
if
the
case
presented
a
state
law
characterization
of
301
suite
reasonably
described
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action,
but
required
application
of
an
unusually
short
or
long
limitation
period,
for
example...
under
the
new
mexico
statute,
where
it
must
be
commenced
within
60
days
following
the
date
of
discharge.
justice
jr.
you
don't
think
it
reflects
upon
the
fairness,
at
least,
of
the
60
day
statute?
