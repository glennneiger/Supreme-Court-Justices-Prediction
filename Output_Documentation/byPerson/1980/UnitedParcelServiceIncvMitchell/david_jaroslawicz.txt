mr.
david
jaroslawicz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whatever
the
statute
of
limitations
may
be
in
a
section
301
claim,
it
is
not
the
statute
of
limitations
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award.
at
least,
insofar
as
the
employee
goes
and
that's
mr.
mitchell,
or
any
other
american
worker,
and
i
think
it
strange
to
see
here
today,
labor
and
management
lined
up
on
one
side
and
nobody
on
the
side
of
mr.
mitchell,
and
saying,
if
he
claims
something
is
wrong,
give
him
a
forum
to
have
his
complaint
heard.
if
this
were
true--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
that's
precisely
the
point.
in
those
cases
where
the
employee
has
a
chance
to
be
heard
in
the
arbitration
and
the
union
doesn't
sell
him
out,
then
he
has
no
301
claim
in
the
first
place.
the
only
time
he
ever
gets
to
a
section
301
claim
is
where
he
has
a
more
than
probable
showing
that
the
union
sold
him
out,
that
he
never
had
a
hearing
below
and
then
his
forum
is
the
courthouse.
until
he
can
get
by
those
two
basic
standards,
he
doesn't
have
a
301
claim;
then
the
arbitration
is
binding.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
it
might
be
construed
an
unfair
labor
practice
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
i
believe,
justice
rehnquist,
that
it's
a
statutory
claim,
and
i
think
it's
most
analogous
to
a
1983
action
under
the
civil
rights
law.
if
you
take,
for
example,
an
employee
who
works
for
an
agency
of
some
sort,
state
agency.
and
he
has
outspoken
views
on
abortion
or
minority
rights,
which
his
supervisor
doesn't
agree
with
and
he
fires
him
for
that.
he
then
goes
ahead
and
files
a
1983
claim,
which,
similarly
to
section
301,
has
no
built-in
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
no,
but
united
parcel
service,
justice
rehnquist,
is
his
employer.
and
there's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--no,
there
was
no
1983--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--claim,
no,
no.
this
case
does
not
have
a
1983
claim,
your
honor.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
most
analogous
situation
is
that
of
a
1983
claim
where
all
the
courts
have
said
that
the
statute
of
limitations
to
be
applied
is
the
state
statutes
for
a
claim
upon
a
statutory
claim,
which
in
new
york
is
three
years,
in
other
states
it
might
be
two
years.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
which
would
be,
i
believe,
the
six
month
statute.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
which
is
what
they
are
opting
for.
and
i
don't
believe
it
can
be,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
the
decision
in
vaca
v.
sipes,
justice
stewart.
because
as
was
pointed
out
there,
an
employee
in
this
situation
cannot
obtain
complete
relief
unless
both
the
employer
and
the
union
are
in
the
suit
together.
because
you
have
an
employee
as
mr.
mitchell,
who
after
13
years
was
discharged.
you
can't
say
to
him
we'll
give
you
money,
although
money
is
nice,
he
wants
his
job
back,
he
wants
his
seniority
back,
he
wants
his
pension
rights,
and
he
wants
his
job
where
he
lives
and
he
has
worked
for
15
years.
this
is...
his
discharge
was
improper.
now
the
other
reason
i
say
that
this--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--well
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
is,
most
meritorious
claims
the
employee
is
not...
who's
out
of
work
and
has
no
money
is
not
going
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
statute
and
say,
i'm
going
to
take
it
down
to
the
line
and
see
what
happens.
certainly,
if
an
employee
does
that,
the
court
can
limit
his
damages
by
saying
he
should
have
mitigated.
and
finally,--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--there
could
be
a
laches
doctrine
precisely.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
if
the
union
can
show
or
the
employer
can
show
that
an
employee
had
deliberately
waited
knowing
of
his
right
and
that
the
employer
had
been
harmed
because
it
hired
other
people
in
the
interim,
laches
might
very
well
be
applicable.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
no,
your
honor,
the
actions
by
the
employee
against
the
employer,
it
is
the
plaintiff's
position
or
mitchell's
position,
that
it
would
be
either
a
breach
of
contract
action...
because
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
now
been
breached.
in
the
alternative,
it
is
a
statutory
claim
brought
pursuant
to
section
301.
but
one
thing
it
is
not
is
an
action
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
didn't
say
it
should
be
governed
by
laches,
i
was
responding
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
what
happens
if
an
employee
waits
for
six
years
and
i
said
if
he
waits
properly
because
there's
a
valid
reason,
then
the
statute
would
be
his
cutoff
point.
if
he
waits
improperly,
then
the
doctrine
of
laches
might
apply.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
well
perhaps
laches
is
the
wrong
pigeonhole
to
put
it
in,
your
honor,
but
in
labor
cases--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--yes,
justice--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--yes.
but
when
the
case
got
to--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--trial,
the
court
could
mitigate
his
damage
and
say
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
recover
for
waiting
19
years.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
where
there
are
frequent
cases--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--i'll
be
happy
to--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--where
an
employee
is
out
of
work
because
he's
been
discharged
and
for
a
year
he
doesn't
get
another
job
when
a
job
is
available
to
him,
and
sits
back.
the
arbitrator
or
judge
then
says
to
the
employee,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
damages
for
the
time
you
could
have
worked--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--if
there
was
an--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--i
cannot
refer,
your
honor,
to
a
case
of
that
nature.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
laches
is
an
equitable
defense.
which
is
available
to
the
employer
in
a
case
where
it's
properly
available,
not
to
the
statute--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--i
agree
with--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--yes,
that's
basically--
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
--and
i
believe
that
he
has
a
right
to
get
to
court.
and
i
don't
believe
the
statute
was
meant
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award.
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
i
believe
justice
timbers
took
that
from
this
court's
decision
in
hoosier.
where
this
court
in
hoosier,
said
that
six
years
was
relatively
rapid
and
in
that
case,
admittedly,
the
court
was
choosing
between
a
20
year
statute
and
a
six
year
statute,
and
so
the
court
indicated
that
six
years
was
relatively
rapid
and
sufficient
to
meet
labor
policy
and
that's
where
i
believe
judge
timbers
adopted
that
from.
and
the
reason
i
say
to
the
court
that
it
can't
be
a
motion
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award,
is
that
nobody
even
in
this
court,
argues
that
the
plaintiff's
remedy
or
the
employee's
remedy
is
to
go
back
and
have
a
new
arbitration.
if
this
were
truly
an
attempt
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award,
as
it
is
where
there's
corruption
of
an
arbitrator,
the
employee's
remedy
is
to
go
back
to
a
new
arbitrator
where
there
won't
be
corruption
and
he'll
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
arbitrator.
but
that
is
not
a
section
301
claim.
a
section
301
claim
is
a
separate
claim,
which
the
statute
and
congress
has
given
an
employee,
it
says
if
you
didn't
have
a
fair
hearing
and
the
union
sold
you
out,
whether
it's
arbitration
or
anything
else,
you
have
a
right
to
be
here.
and
that's
what
vaca
said
and
that's
what
hines
said.
i
think
it's
also
interesting
to
see
that
the
union
in
this
case,
in
filing
of
a
brief,
said
we
should
have
the
same
statute
of
limitations
as
the
employer.
the
employer,
in
its
reply
brief
said,
we
don't
want
the
same
statute
of
limitations
as
the
union,
we
get
a
different
statute
of
limitations.
i
believe
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
union
clearly
knows
that
it
cannot
possibly
argue
that
the
statute
of
limitations
as
against
the
union
is
90
days
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award
because
there
is
no
arbitration
award
to
be
vacated
against
the
union.
while
the
employer
has
a
superficially
appealing
argument,
it
says
you're
really
trying
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award.
but
that's
not
so.
the
arbitration
was
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
the
employee's
right
may
have
been
at
stake,
but
he
never
had
a
chance
to
be
heard
and
his
rights
weren't
adjudicated,
if
not,
he
would
never
get
to
the
section
301
claim.
and
i
say
that
if
the
union
or
the
employer
wanted
to
bypass
the
arbitration
award
or
vacate
it,
if
you
will,
here
the
statute
of
limitations
is
90
days,
because
that's
the
agreement
between
them.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
employee,
it's
not
90
days,
and
under
the
standing
issue,
which
i
think
the
second
circuit
probably
recognized,
he
would
have
no
standing
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
even
bring
the
proceeding,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
said
if
you're
unhappy
with
what
your
union
did,
you
bring
a
separate
action,
a
301
action,
against
your
union,
but
you
can't
interfere
in
the
arbitration,
which
is
a
proceeding
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
that,
your
honor,
is
basically
mitchell's
position.
thank
you.
unless
the
court
has
any
questions?
mr.
david
jaroslawicz
no
facts
in
the
complaint.
