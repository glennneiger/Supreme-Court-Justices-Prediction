justice
stevens
or
possibly
we'd
go
back
to
congress
and
say
maybe
congress
ought
to
enact
the
statute.
justice
stevens
ultimately
they
did
it
in
the
anti-trust
area,
though,
as
you
know?
justice
stevens
mr.
segal,
on
this
question
of
unfairness,
it's
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
case
because
we
have
the
union
which,
if
we
accept
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
theory
of
the
complaint,
has
violated
its
duty
of
representing
the
employee
fairly--
justice
stevens
--but
it
must
file
within
90
days?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
facts
that
form
the
basis
of
the
claim
of
unfair
representation
do
not
come
to
the
attention
of
the
employee
within
the
90-day
period?
justice
stevens
does
the
new
york
statute
provide
for
tolling
of
the
90-day
period?
justice
stevens
well
because
we're
relying
on
the
new
york
statute
here.
and
there
is
a
doctrine
in
new
york
that
the
90-day
suit
to
set
aside
an
arbitration
award
is
tolled--
justice
stevens
--well
i
understand
that
the
tolling
for
fraud
is
one
thing,
but
it
isn't
always
true
that
the
mere
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
facts
on
which
your
cause
of
action
is
based
is
a
sufficient
ground
for
tolling.
justice
stevens
and
that's
what
might
be
involved
in
this
kind
of
case.
justice
stevens
well
of
course
if
the
facts
are
that
clear
you
don't
really
need
a
statute
of
limitations,
do
you?
justice
stevens
he
has
this
burden
of
course,
not
you.
justice
stevens
you're
not
arguing
laches,
you're
just
arguing
the
duty
to
mitigate,
which
reduces
the
damage
claim.
that's
all
you're
arguing.
justice
stevens
i
do
have
a
question.
there
is
nothing,
or
am
i
wrong
on
this,
in
the
complaint,
or
no
facts
are
alleged
which
account
for
the
failure
to
file
more
promptly.
is
that
correct?
