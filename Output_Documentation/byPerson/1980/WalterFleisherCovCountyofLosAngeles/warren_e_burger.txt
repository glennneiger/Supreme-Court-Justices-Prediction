mr.
manpearl,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
it
isn't
likely
that
he's
unaware,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
suggested.
chief
justice
burger
is
the
material
involved
here
in
the
same
relationship
in
terms
of
the
movement
in
commerce
as
material
coming
from...
let
me
put
it
another
way:
is
the
material
that's
moving
into
california
or
originating
in
california,
destined
for
interstate
commerce,
different
in
some
respects
from
the
material
coming
from
korea
or
japan,
coming
to
rest
temporarily
in
warehouses
in
california,
and
then
going
into
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
burger
if
we
can
segregate
these
issues,
as
justice
blackmun
has
implied,
how
can
you
say
they're
a
party
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
other
purposes?
chief
justice
burger
who
presents
the
federal
question
to
us?
chief
justice
burger
you're
really
saying
one
party
to
the
controversy
has
a
forum
and
the
other
party
doesn't.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
burger
you
think
they're
not
doing
both?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
manpearl.
mr.
hickok.
chief
justice
burger
was
a
declaratory
judgment
open
to
either
los
angeles
or
the
taxpayers?
chief
justice
burger
you'd
be
just
where
you
were
before
an
appeal--
chief
justice
burger
--before
your
friend
brought
you
up
here.
chief
justice
burger
you
are
contending
to
be
litigating.
you
are
not
the
initiating
party.
chief
justice
burger
under
the
new
statute
if
that
occurred,
could
your...
could
the
taxpayer
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
and
perhaps
wind
up
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
perhaps
with
a
different
result?
chief
justice
burger
why
is
the
state
in
a
different
position
from
the
county
in
the
context
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
left,
mr.
manpearl.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
79-700,
the
walter
fleisher
company
against
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
california,
second
appellate
district
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
taking
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
