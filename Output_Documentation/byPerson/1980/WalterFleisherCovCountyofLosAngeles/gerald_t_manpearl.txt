mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
a
state
property
tax
exemption
statute
so
interferes
with
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
that
this
court
must
declare
it
unconstitutional.
at
the
outset
it
should
be
noted
that
the
state
courts
have
ruled
that
the
statute
is
a
reasonable
classification
statute
and
that
it
does
not
violate
equal
protection
standards.
also
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
whether
the
county
of
los
angeles
has
standing
to
raise
a
federal
constitutional
objection
to
this
legislation.
the
county
of
los
angeles
places
great
reliance
on
the
argument--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--no,
i
did
not.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
in
california
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
attorney
general
appear
in
cases
in
which
a
state
statute
is
under
consideration
or
under
attack.
we
did
not--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--we
know
of
no
such
duty.
we've
had
many
instances
in
the
state
courts...
quite
honestly,
i've
been
litigating
property
tax
matters
in
the
state
courts
for
over
ten
years
and
i
have
never
seen
the
attorney
general
intervene
in
a
case.
although
the
fleisher
case
was
not
reported
in
the
official
reports,
the
sears
case
was;
he
was
well
aware
of
it.
i
assume
he
was
well
aware
of
it.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
no.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
i
know
there
are
many
states
which
have
procedures
requiring
notification.
california
does
not
have
such
a
procedure.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
to
make
the
assumption
that
the
attorney
general's
office
does
read
the
advance
sheets
in
california
and
at
least
is
fully
aware
of
the
sears
case,
although
he
may
not
be
aware
of
this
case
because
it
is
unrecorded.
however,
the
department
of
economic
and
business
development
in
california,
which
is
a
branch
of
the
state
administration,
was
aware
of
this
case,
and
they
were
interested
and
concerned
with
it.
but
i
know
of
no
communication
between
either
party
or,
in
the
sears
case,
regarding
the
attorney
general.
the
county
of
los
angeles
in
this
case
places
great
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
before
this
court
discriminates
or
makes
a
distinction
between
foreign
commerce
on
the
one
hand
and
inter
and
intrastate
commerce
on
the
other.
however,
a
property
tax
exemption
statute
by
its
very
definition
must
discriminate,
make
a
distinction,
against
those
groups
that
are
not
similarly
exempted.
the
issue
which
must
be
resolved
is
not
whether
there's
a
distinction;
obviously
there's
a
distinction.
the
question
that
must
be
resolved
is
whether
such
distinction
is
so
burdensome,
so
unreasonable,
that
it
places
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
and
must
be
struck
down
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
economics
would
dictate
that
there
are
different
types
of
materials,
there's
different
products
and
commodities
that
are
manufactured
in
korea
than
are
manufactured
in
california.
but,
you
know,
i
assume
we
could
find
an
example
where
there
might
be
some
similarity,
but
generally
different
products
come
to
california
from
overseas
than
are
manufactured
in
california.
and
to
that
extent,
the
goods
that
are
manufactured
in
california
do
not
receive
this
exemption,
even
if
they're
being
shipped
out
of
state,
while
the
overseas
goods
would
receive
the
exemption.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes;
we
would
agree
with
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes.
they
are
creatures
of
the
state.
they
are--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--that
is
correct;
yes.
it
is
our
contention
that
as
a
creation
of
the
state
it
has
no
constitutional
standing
to
attack
the
statute
before
this
court
today,
and
i
would
cite
this
court
to
the
decision
in
williams
v.
mayor
and
city
council
of
baltimore,
decided
by
this
court
in
1933.
i
believe
that
case
is
analogous,
if
not
on
all
fours,
with
the
instant
situation.
there
maryland
adopted
a
tax
exemption
for
the
washington,
baltimore,
and
annapolis
electric
railroad
company
because
it
was
in
receivership
and
it
was
important
to
the
state
because
it
was
the
only
link
between
annapolis
and
the
capital.
the
cities
of
maryland
and
annapolis
proceeded
to
attempt
to
impose
taxes
on
the
railroad,
saying
the
statute
was
an
unconstitutional
exemption
under
the
commerce
clause
and
due
process.
justice
cardozo,
speaking
for
this
court,
stated,
"a
municipal
corporation
created
by
a
state
for
the
better
ordering
of
government
has
no
privileges
or
immunities
under
the
federal
constitution
which
it
may
invoke
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
its
creator.
"
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
that
question
was
exactly--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
contend
that
standing
to
raise
a
federal
question
is
itself
a
federal
question.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
that's
correct,
but
the
question
of
whether
a
subdivision
of
the
state
has
standing
to
raise
a
federal
constitutional
question,
i
believe,
must
be
a
constitutional
question
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
on
the
ground
that
the
county
of
los
angeles
does
not
have
standing
to
raise
a
federal
constitutional
objection.
if
it
were
a
state--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--in
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court;
yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
we
sued
the
county
for
a
refund
of
taxes.
the
county
defended
on
a
number
of
grounds.
they
defended
on
the
grounds
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
didn't
grant
an
exemption,
and
a
number
of
others.
the
state
courts
ruled
against
the
county
on
all
grounds
except
the
federal
question,
the
federal
question
being
the
commerce
clause
issue.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
we're
not
saying
that
they're
not
a
party.
we
believe
they
are
a
proper
party,
they
obviously
have
an
interest.
what
we're
saying
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
they
have
no
right
to
raise
a
federal
constitutional
objection
to
a
statute
on
a
ground
in
which
they
have
no
direct
interest
whatsoever.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
or
not
pass
a
statute.
i
don't
think
they
could,
although
that's
not
our
specific
situation.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
mr.
justice--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--but
i
believe
they
do
under
state
law.
you
could
have--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--i
believe
that
they
cannot.
i
believe
it's
analogous
to
the
williams
v.
mayor
and
city
of
baltimore,
where
this
court
said
that
the
cities
could
not
raise
such
a
federal
constitutional
question
in
this
court.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
no,
let
me
very
briefly
address
that
question,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
because
generally
you
have
an
appellee
arguing
there
is
no
standing,
and
relief
in
those
circumstances
is
to
dismiss
the
action.
where
you
have
an
appellant
arguing
that
there
is
no
standing
to
raise
a
particular
defense--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--right.
i--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--i
believe
there
is
a
federal
question
and
that
federal
question
is
the
issue,
the
very
issue
of
whether
a
county
has
standing
to
raise
a
federal
question.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
the
county
of
los
angeles.
well,
we...
the
appellant
has
presented
the
federal
question
of
whether
or
not
the
county
has
the
ability
to
raise
a
federal
constitutional
provision
as
a
defense.
however,
i
think
that
the
question
of
standing,
the
question
of
the
county's
interest
in
this
litigation
is
really
as
relevant
or
perhaps
more
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
a
commerce
clause
violation
at
all.
i
think
it
goes
at
the
very
heart
of
this
very
issue
before
the
court.
because,
if
we
look
at
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
in
recent
years
under
the
commerce
clause,
in
every
case
the
question
has
been
the
extent
of
the
burden
of
interference
with
commerce.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
that
goes...
yes.
i
was
saying,
mr.
justice,
that
i
believe
this
question
of
the
county's
interest
in
the
litigation
goes
not
only
to
the
standing
question
which
i've
argued,
but
i
believe
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
commerce
clause
question
itself.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
would
agree
with
that.
at
that
point
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeal
of
california.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
i
would
submit
that
that
would
leave
a
plaintiff
an
appellant
in
the
position
of
walter
fleisher
company
without
relief
to
an
improperly
raised
federal
question.
i
believe
where
an
appellant
is
entitled--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
we're
saying
that
the
very
issue,
the
very
issue
of
who
may
raise
a
federal
question
is
a
federal
question
itself,
and
you
can
resolve
that
issue
in
favor
of
the
appellant,
and
reverse
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeal
saying,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
the
county
of
los
angeles
does
not
have
standing
to
raise
a
federal
commerce
clause
question.
but--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--well,
i
believe,
mr.
justice,
you
could
do
the
same
in
this
case,
but
the
form
of
relief
would
then
have
to
take
a
reversal.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
i
think
the
state
court
has
ruled
on
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice;
yes,
sir.
if
i
may
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
commerce
clause
question
itself,
i
think
this
case
stands
in
contrast
to
the
numerous
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
in
the
last
ten
years
on
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
in
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court,
the
major
distinguishing
factor
is
that
in
every
single
case
we
had
a
party
standing
before
this
court
saying,
i
have
been
injured
by
the
commerce
clause
violation.
in
this
case
the
county
of
los
angeles
is
not
saying,
i
have
been
injured
by
the
commerce
clause
violation.
clearly
the
county
of
los
angeles
is
losing
tax
money.
they
clearly
have
an
interest.
they
are
not,
however,
an
injured
party
under
the
commerce
clause
violation.
they
are
the
champion
of
some
hypothetical
manufacturers
that
are
not
receiving
a
similar
exemption.
they
are
saying,
we
are
protecting
the
rights
of
others
albeit
we
are
doing
it
so
we
can
save
taxes
or
collect
more
tax
money.
they
are
championing
somebody
else
and
that,
i
would
submit,
is
a
major
distinction
between
all
the
cases
that
have
troubled
this
court
in
the
last
ten
years.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
i
don't
believe
they
are
saying,
we
are
a
victim
of
the
commerce
clause
violation.
they
are
the
champion
for
someone
else.
and
i
would
submit,
that's
a
major
distinction
between
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court,
like
lewis
v.
bt
investments,
where
you
had
florida
trying
to
prevent
out-of-state
investment
advisors,
and
you
had
before
this
court
a
new
york
corporation
saying,
florida
can't
keep
us
out.
in
raymond
motor
transport
you
had
an
interstate
transport
carrier
coming
before
this
court
and
saying,
i'm
injured
by
the
statutes
of
wisconsin
which
prevent
trucks
that
are
over
55
feet
in
length;
i'm
injured.
and
this
court
looked
at
the
statute
and
said,
not
only
was
there
no
basis
for
the
statute,
but
there
was
a
favoritism
of
wisconsin
truckers
vis-a-vis
out-of-state
truckers.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
you
mean,
involved
in
a--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--i
think
you
would
have...
similarly,
you
would
have
a
case
where
somebody
is
injured,
somebody
is
fighting.
you
would
have
a
case
similar
to
reeves
v.
state,
where
the
south
dakota
cement
commission
attempted
to
sell
their
proprietary
product
only
to
south
dakota
manufacturers
or
users.
but
you
would
have
before
this
court
a
party
saying,
i
am
injured
by
the
commerce
clause
violation,
i
am
the
victim.
i
think
you've
had
that
in
every
case.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
mr.
justice,
i
agree
that
that
would
certainly
go
to
the
standing
question
again.
as
to
the
merits,
i
think
the
merits
would
be
no
different.
on
the
standing
issue,
you
would
have
the
same
problem
you
have
here.
you
would
have
a
creature
of
the
state
attacking
the
state
statute.
in
reeves
v.
state
you
had
no
such
problem,
because
it
was
the
wyoming
consumer
that
was
objecting
to
the
commerce
clause
injury.
my
analogy
was
not
as
to
the
standing
question
but
as
to
the
merits
themselves.
on
the
merits
we
don't
have
a
party
before
this
court
that
is
saying,
look,
i'm
the
victim
of
this
commerce
clause
violation,
i
am
being
injured
because
of
something
the
state
of
california
has
done
to
interfere
and
burden
commerce.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
i
totally
agree,
but
i
also
would
submit
that
such
considerations
go
equally
to
the
merits
of
the
commerce
clause
question,
because
ultimately,
assuming
that
this
court
finds
against
me
on
the
standing
question,
that
simply
gets
us
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
now,
on
the
merits
of
the
case
i
would
submit
that
we
still
must
find
under
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
last
ten
years,
we
must
find,
first,
whether
there
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
that
burden
then
has
to
be
balanced
against
the
state
interest,
the
state
needs,
and
the
commerce
clause
considerations
for
free
and
unhindered
commerce
among
the
states
and
foreign
countries.
and
i
submit
that
the
question
of
the
county's
interest
goes
as
much
to
the
merits
as
anything
else,
because
without
a
party
standing
before
this
court
saying,
i
am
injured,
i
have
been
hurt,
where
is
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
where
has
the
county
of
los
angeles
shown
a
burden
as
the
regional
stock
exchanges
did
in
boston
stock
exchange
v.
the
tax
commissioner?
where
is
the
burden
that
someone
is
showing,
as
the
cantaloupe
grower
did
in
pike
v.
bruce
church,
inc.,
where
he
said
the
arizona
regulations
preventing
me
from
having
my
cantaloupes
packaged
in
california
are
a
burden?
where
is
the
burden
that
was
shown
in
hunt
v.
washington
apple
advertising
company?
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
saying
he'd
prevail,
but
i'm
saying--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--well,
i'm
saying
that
at
least
at
that
point
he'd
have
someone
before
this
court
that
was
saying,
i
am
injured,
and
the
court
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
the
judgment
as
to
whether
there's
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
we
have
nobody
showing--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
i'm
arguing
the
merits
of
whether--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--well,
no,
the
merits
may
not.
but
they
do
in
terms
of
trying
to
evaluate
the
burden.
we
haven't...
i
don't
believe
the
county
of
los
angeles
has
shown
any
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
i
certainly
think
they
would
have
standing.
i
think
there'd
be
no
question
that
they
would
have
standing
to
raise
this
objection.
but
the
objection
would
come
in
the
form
of
them
objecting
to
the
california
legislation
that
imposes
the
tax
on
them.
they
wouldn't
come
before
this
court
or
the
california
court
and
say,
tax
the
japanese
manufacturers.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
well,
it
would
be
one
alternative
the
california
court
had.
i
would
submit
that
in
boston
stock
exchange
that's
exactly
what
happened.
we
would
have
this
type
of
case
if
the
tax
collector
of
new
york
said,
i'm
going
to
collect
the
higher
tax
from
everybody
who
transfers.
we
would
never
be
able
to
see
the
burden.
instead,
we
have
it
in
a
proper
context
in
the
boston
stock
exchange,
where
the
regional
stock
exchanges
came
into
court
and
said,
imposing
a
higher
tax
rate
on
transfers,
stock
transfers
on
the
regional
exchanges
vis-a-vis
the
new
york
stock
exchanges,
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
we
are--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--i
don't
know
whether
there
would
or
not,
mr.
justice.
there
may
very
well
be
a
burden,
or
more
importantly,
i
think
it
might
be
considered
an
unreasonable
classification.
and
if
the--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--no,
mr.
justice,
they
do
not.
the
state
of
california
court
conceded
that
if
we
were
talking
about
equal
protection
as--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--a
classification,
they
conceded
it
was
a
reasonable
classification.
and
historically
the
differentiation
between
imported
goods
and--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--i
think
we
would
be
getting
back
to
a
very
classic
equal
protection
argument
as
we
had
in
allied
stores
v.
bowers.
the
basis...
they
judged
a
very
similar
exemption
statute.
they
had
an
exemption
statute
similar
to
that.
they
exempted
the
warehoused
goods,
ohio
did,
exempted
the
warehoused
goods
of
all
out-of-state
warehousing
activities
but
not
ohio
companies.
and
this
court
said,
that
was
not
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
that's
the
question
that
ought
to
be
raised
in
these
type
of
cases,
not
a
commerce
clause
violation,
but
the
question
ought
to
be
whether
the
classification
is
reasonable
and
sustainable
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
mr.
hickok
has
placed
incorrect
emphasis
on
the
distinction
between
interstate
goods
or
intrastate
and
foreign
goods.
i
think
the
real
distinction
is
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
california
is
discriminating,
not
against
different
types
of
goods,
but
is
attempting
protectionist
legislation.
is
it
attempting
to
isolate
itself?
i
would
refer
this
court
to
the
language
of
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey,
in
which
the
court
said,
"the
opinions
of
the
court
through
the
years
have
reflected
an
alertness
to
the
evils
of
economic
isolation
and
protectionism.
"
the
court
went
on:
"the
critical
inquiry
therefore
must
be
directed
to
determining
whether
chapter
363
is
basically
a
protectionist
measure.
"
i
submit
that
california
has
not
instituted
a
protectionist
measure.
they
have
instituted
a
measure
which
falls
evenhandedly
on
california
businesses,
u.s.
businesses,
and
foreign
businesses.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes,
i
agree,
mr.
justice,
and
i
submit
that
the
court
is
empowered
to
make
such
discrimination--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--the
state
is,
unless
it
violates
equal
protection
standards,
is
an
unreasonable
classification.
but
if
we're
talking
about
commerce
clause,
we
are
talking
about
state
attempts
at
protectionism,
at
isolation.
we
do
not
have
that
here.
i
think
this
case
is
similar
to
the
exxon
v.
maryland
case
of
last
year,
in
which
maryland
attempted
to
prohibit
refiners
and
distributors
from
owning
gas
stations.
and
this
court
pointed
out--
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
--well,
i
strongly
suspect
that
somebody
would
be
before
the
courts
complaining
that
they
had
been
injured,
and
they
would
be
arguing
that
it's
an
illogical
classification
and
no
good
under
equal
protection
laws.
they
would
also
be
saying...
and
demonstrating,
not
just
saying
hypothetically...
they
would
be
demonstrating
how
their
commerce
had
been
interfered
with.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
agree
that
in
virtually
every
case
decided
by
this
court
in
the
last
five
years,
more,
there
have
been
protectionist
overtones,
a
state
attempt
to
isolate
itself
in
some
economic
manner
to
benefit
its
citizens,
its
industry
vis-a-vis
out-of-state
industry.
we
do
not
have
protectionist
measures
here.
there
is
no
attempt
by
california
to
isolate
itself
or
its
businesses.
the
exemption
is
granted
evenhandedly
to
anybody
who
wishes
to
import
foreign
commodities,
or
export.
mr.
gerald
t.
manpearl
thank
you
for
your
attention.
