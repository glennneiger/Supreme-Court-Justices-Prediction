mr.
manpearl,
let
me
ask
you,
did
you
argue
the
sears
case
when
it
was
here?
justice
blackmun
i'd
like
to
ask
the
same
question
i
asked
of
counsel
there.
the
county
of
los
angeles
is
attacking
the
statute
here?
justice
blackmun
and
i'm
impressed
by
the
utter
absence
of
the
attorney
general
of
california.
justice
blackmun
is
it
not
his
general
duty
to
defend
the
statutes
of
the
state?
justice
blackmun
well,
it
isn't
your
responsibility,
in
any
event.
justice
blackmun
but
it
does
seem
strange
when
he
is
the
principal
legal
officer
of
the
state
and
he's
not
here.
justice
blackmun
even
though
you
have
named
the
county
as
a
defendant?
justice
blackmun
counsel,
at
that
point,
are
members,
individual
members
of
the
board
also
defendants
here?
justice
blackmun
well,
who
are
these
"does"
that
are
mentioned
in
the
complaint?
justice
blackmun
so
that
the
only
defendants
are
the
city
and
the
county?
justice
blackmun
mr.
hickok,
at
one
time
there
was
some
legislation
pending
in
sacramento
which
would
have
provided
refunds
of
this
type.
what
is
the
status
of
that?
justice
blackmun
do
you
think
that
statement
is
consistent
with
the
underlying
tone
of
japan
lines?
