mr.
philip
h.
hickok
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
mr.
manpearl
and
the
court
have
noted
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
as
a
threshold
issue
that
must
be
addressed,
and
that
is
the
standing
issue.
it
is
our
position
that
if
this
standing
issue
is
not
favorably
resolved
in
favor
of
the
county
of
los
angeles,
potentially
devastating
results
will
result
to
public
entities
as
we
know
them
now.
this
is
because
article
iii
jurisdiction
for
this
court,
requires
case
or
controversy
standing
as
an
aspect
of
that.
it's
a
plaintiff-oriented
concept.
the
complaining
party
must
have
that
requisite
degree
or
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
decision
which
guarantees
that
the
issues
are
sharpened
and
presented
in
the
proper
manner
to
this
court.
there
are
other
aspects
that
are
applicable
to
defendants,
but
standing
is
not
one
of
them.
the
court
has
further
found
that
true
article
iii
jurisdiction
requires
injury
in
fact
to
be
shown
by
a
plaintiff.
the
zone
of
interest
concept
that
was
talked
about
in
the
data
processing
and
warth
cases
is,
as
justice
powell
pointed,
more
of
a
prudential
concern
of
this
court
should
jurisdiction
be
taken;
not,
is
jurisdiction
available?
we
have
in
this
case
a
prudential
jurisdiction,
a
prudential
standing
case.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
if
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
suffered
actual
or
injury
in
fact;
yes.
now,
that
is
an
example
also
where
you
can
look
at
the
defendant.
is
it
a
collusive
lawsuit?
is
it
a
friendly
lawsuit?
that
might
well
be
a
collusive
lawsuit.
if
you
take
our
current
case
and
have
an
interstate
shipper
as
the
plaintiff
against
the
county
of
los
angeles,
that
also
would
be
a
collusive
lawsuit.
both
the
parties
would
be
raising
the
same
issues.
the
county
would
agree
with
the
interstate
shipper
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
williams
v.
the
city
of
baltimore...
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
50
years
old.
second
of
all,
it
involved
a
public
entity
bringing,
initiating
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court
against
the
state.
it
also
raised
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
equal
protection.
it
did
not...
the
federal
question
involved
is
not
the
commerce
clause.
our
suit
has
to
be
looked
at
from
the
fact
that
it
began
as
a
taxing
event
at
the
local
level.
the
county
assessor
denied
an
exemption
for
goods
under
225.
walter
fleisher
asked
for
that
exemption.
walter
fleisher
submitted
a
formal
claim
for
a
refund
to
the
county.
the
board
of
supervisors
of
the
county
denied
that
claim.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
the
state
statute
is
a
procedural.
it
requires
the
lawsuit
for
refund
of
taxes
only
to
be
brought
against
the
taxing
authorities.
it's
a
procedural
statute
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
they
were
never
identified
and
i
believe
that
if
normal
practice
was
followed,
they
were
dismissed...
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that
is
correct.
they
represent
the
only
taxing
authorities
before
this
court,
the
only
defendants.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
no.
initially--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--the
county
of
los
angeles
was
established
by
the
california
constitution,
not
the
california
legislature.
the
counties
within
the
state
of
california
are
different
from
counties
on
the
east
coast
and
in
other
areas
of
the
nation.
they
are
the
largest
political
subdivision
of
the
state;
they
have
corporate
powers
to
sue
and
to
be
sued;
the
legislature
cannot
restrict
and
has
not
restricted
the
counties'
ability
to
sue
the
state.
counties
in
california
have
independent
grounds
to
sue
the
state
of
california
and
its
various
state
agencies
and
officials.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
an
analogy
under
the
civil
rights
act
is
also
an
excellent
reason
why
the
county
has
to
be
allowed
to
have
this
prudential
standing.
it
is
now
a
person
under
the
civil
rights
act;
the
court
in
monell
held
that.
now
this
court
is
also
saying
that
counties
are
strictly
liable
for
any
official
actions
taken
by
it
or
its
officials
which
happen
to
deny
the
person's
constitutional
rights.
that
was
your
owen
decision,
earlier
this
year.
if
the
county
is
not
allowed
to
stand
before
you
and
argue
standing,
argue
the
constitutionality--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--federal
and
state.
--that's
right.
what
i'm
saying
is,
we'll
be
in
the
catch-22
situation.
under
an
owen
theory,
we
would
be
strictly
liable
should
the
statute
as
we
believe
be
declared
unconstitutional.
under
a
prudential
standing
decision,
we'd
go
back
to
our
local
superior
court;
we
could
not
raise
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
defense;
and
judgment
would
be
entered
against
the
county
there
also.
we
have
88
lawsuits
pending,
in
excess
of
$10
million,
currently,
and
that's
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
there
are
at
least
that
many
claims
pending
in
front
of
the
board
of
supervisors.
if
we
have
to
sit
in
this
untenable
position
of
being
strictly
liable
if
we
follow
the
statute
and
strictly
liable
if
we
disobey
the
statute,
the
resulting
financial
damage
suits
could
be
devastating.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that
is
correct.
it
is
an
exemption
to
a
taxing,
to
the
ad
valorem
tax
system.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
at
that
time,
no.
we
could...
california
now
has
enacted
a
section
in
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
which
gives
specific
authority
to
the
local
assessors
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
the
state
regarding
state
tax
policies.
it
was
not
done
and
that
statute
was
post...
post
case--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--it
is
still
pending,
your
honor.
and
that
is
exactly...
that
is
at
least
a
second
reason
why
there
has
to
be
standing
in
this
case,
to
resolve
the
issue,
because
the
sacramento
legislature
cannot,
i
don't
believe,
enact
that
refund
legislation.
i
think
that
we
have
a
california
court
of
appeals
that
has
declared
the
section
unconstitutional.
if
sacramento
enacted
refund
legislation,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
our
constitution,
the
california
constitution,
being
a
gift
of
public
funds.
therefore
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
not
invoke
its
article
iii
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
danger
that
you're
going
to
be
intruding
into
an
area
more
appropriately
addressed
by
other
governmental
bodies.
this
is
the
only
forum
left
to
resolve
this
issue.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that
would
be
fine
from
the
county
standpoint,
your
honor.
if
no
standing
was
found
here,
we
would
retain
the
monies.
however,
the
precedential
value
of
this
court
deciding
the
county
has
no
standing
in
a
situation
like
this
is
far-reaching.
who
is
to
say
that
tomorrow
this
precedent
might
be
applied
to
a
non-tax--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
county,
the
public
entity
in
that
case
was
the
initiator.
it
was
the
plaintiff
in
federal
court.
it
had
to
meet
federal
standing,
article
iii
standing
requirements.
article
iii
standing
requirements
have
been
met
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
has
suffered
injury
in
fact.
it
has
paid
taxes
and
it
wants
to
get
them
back.
that's
injury
right
there.
the
plaintiff
is
also
within
the
zone
of
interest
that
surrounds
section
225.
i
have
to
hark
back
to
my
initial
statement
that
this
is
a
plaintiff-oriented
concept.
public
entities
have
to
be
allowed
to
defend
their
agents
and
employees
and
their
actions
on
constitutional
grounds.
if
not,
another
reason
would
be
an
anomalous
result.
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
indicated
that
state
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
can
entertain
lawsuits
that
involve
federal
questions.
our
court
of
appeal
in
california
did
just
that.
it
rendered
a
decision
declaring
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
if
this
court
then
finds
the
public
entity
has
no
standing,
the
decision
is
nonreviewable
by
the
federal
court.
that's
an
untenable
position.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that
would
be
fine
in
this
case,
your
honor.
we'll
just
be
worried--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--yeah;
i
would
be
worried
about
future
litigation
myself.
those
are
the
basic
reasons
why
we
feel
this
standing
issue
has
to
be
resolved
in
our
favor.
true,
article
iii
jurisdiction
is
present.
it's
present
by
virtue
of
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff.
the
prudential
concerns
of
the
court,
the
zone
of
interests,
is
also
present,
both
on
the
plaintiff's
side
and
on
the
county's
side.
it's
an
issue
which
this
court
must
resolve.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
in
this
case?
yes.
however--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--probably
if
the
court
said
that--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--we
would
win
the
case
and
lose
the
war.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
because
if
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
public
entities
cannot
defend
the
actions
of
its
employees--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--okay.
if
the
court
just
chose--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--in
that
situation
we
would
win,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
was
brought
to
this
court.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
we
should
point
out,
we
are
not
the
litigating
party.
we
were
brought
here
against
our
will,
but
we
are
still,
we
are
here.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that
is
correct.
we
are
defending
the
action
of
our
employees,
or
our
officials.
we
are
not
allowed,
the
assessor
and
the
board
are
not
allowed
to
sit
here.
it
is
only
the
county,
the
public
entity,
the
city
and
the
county.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
it's
conceivable,
your
honor.
it's
conceivable
also
that
the
city...
or,
excuse
me,
the
assessor
could
bring
a
declaratory
action
against
the
state
with
taxpayers
joining
in
as
being
interested
parties.
there's
a
procedure
for
that
also.
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
question,
the
court
must
first
address
itself
to
a
threshold
question,
and
that
is
whether
under
any
situation,
under
any
circumstances,
can
a
state's
treatment
of
foreign
commerce
ever
be
discriminatory
towards
interstate
commerce.
obviously
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
and
a
state
statute
which
places
a
discriminatory
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
a
state
statute
treats
foreign
commerce
differently
from
interstate.
is
that
constitutional?
can
it
ever
be
unconstitutional?
we
feel
that
a
statute
that
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
and
in
favor
of
foreign
commerce
is
just
as
objectionable
as
one
that
discriminates
against
interstate
in
favor
of
local
economic
interests.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
yes,
because
in
japan
lines
you
had
the
complete
auto
test,
which
was
the
underlying
commerce
clause
question.
on
top
of
that
a
two-pronged
foreign
commerce
test
was
imposed.
in
that
situation
the
four-pronged
complete
auto
test
still
had
to
be
resolved.
one
of
the
aspects
there
is
whether
the
statute
is
discriminatory
or
not.
does
the
statute
regulate
evenhandedly?
if
it
does
it
probably
will
be
upheld
unless
there
is
an
excessive
burden
placed
on
commerce.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
statute
which
does
not
regulate
even-handedly
on
its
face.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeal
properly
looked
at
the
statute
itself
as
opposed
to
the
interest
to
be
justified
by
the
state.
it
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
your
decisions
in
hughes
v.
state
of
oklahoma,
or
lewis
v.
bt
investments,
but
it
did
have
before
it
boston
stock
exchange.
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
correctly
interpreted
the
decision
in
hughes.
hughes
talks
about
an
oklahoma
statute
which
was
discriminatory
on
its
face.
that's
a
conclusionary
term.
however,
the
statute
differentiated
on
its
face
between
commerce
interstate
and
domestic.
this
court
found
that
once
you
have
shown
that
a
statute
treats
commerce
differently,
it
may
fall.
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
position,
it
might
be
per
se
invalid.
this
court
held
in
philadelphia
v.
new
jersey
a
statute
to
be
per
se
invalid.
it
decided
that
even
admittedly
legitimate
state
interests
cannot
be
achieved
through
a
discriminating
means.
similar,
our
statute
operates
the
same
way.
we
have
a
legitimate
means,
legitimate
interests
in
california
in
protecting
its
port
and
warehousing
trade
as
a
pure
economic
interest.
it's
not
health
and
safety;
pure
economics.
it
cannot
justify
a
discriminatory
statute,
especially
when
there
are
at
least
two
alternatives
available
to
it
to
achieve
this
same
purpose
with
no
discriminatory
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
california
could
have
exempted
all
business
inventory
to
be
shipped
out
of
the
state.
that
would
have
had
the
same
effect
in
fostering
and
encouraging
the
local
economic
interest.
or
it
could
have
exempted
all
business
inventory
within
the
state.
that
too
is
an
available
non-discriminatory
alternative.
california
finally
chose
the
latter
course
of
action.
it
amended
section
219,
which
had
the
effect
of
repealing
section
225,
the
statute
in
question.
hence,
california
has
recognized
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
and
now
has
moved
to
cure
it
in
a
manner
in
accord
with
other
states
in
the
nation.
only
if
the
court--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
only
if
the
court
finds
that
the
statute
regulates
evenhandedly
will
it
usually
go
to
the
successive
burden
test
under
lewis,
as
an
example,
pike
v.
bruce
church
as
another
example.
look
at
the
statute.
if
it
regulates
evenhandedly,
then
look
at
the
excessive
burden
placed
on
interstate
commerce.
in
this
particular
case
the
burden
which
is
placed
on
interstate
commerce
is
easily
ascertainable.
it
can
be
derived
simply
by
looking
at
the
benefit
to
be
obtained
by
foreign
commerce.
in
this
particular
case
walter
fleisher
stands
to
benefit
by
a
dollar
equivalent
of
1.68
percent
of
the
market
value
of
its
goods.
the
case
argued
earlier
this
year,
sears,
they
stand
to
benefit
by
close
to
1-1/2
percent
of
the
dollar
equivalent
of
the
market
value
of
their
goods.
conversely,
a
united
states
businessman
shipping
his
goods
through
california
is
burdened
by
exactly
the
same
amount.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
unless
they're
exporting
it.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
yes
it
does,
your
honor.
if
they
are
exported
out
of
the
united
states.
however,
goods
coming
from
hawaii
on
the
same
boat
as
japanese
goods
to
be
shipped
to
philadelphia
do
not
qualify,
even
if--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
so
there's
discrimination
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
we
don't
have
to
look
at
the
excessive
burden
placed
on
commerce.
the
statute
should
be
struck
down
on
its
face
as
being
invalid,
especially
when
you
have
at
least
two
available
alternatives
that
would
achieve
the
same
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
the
goods
were
not
in
transit;
we
had
agreed
to
that.
so--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--no.
i'm
sorry,
it
wasn't,
your
honor.
however,
it
was--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--that
was
the
original
package
concept,
overruling
of
lowe
v.
austin.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
correct.
exactly.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
michelin
held
that
the
states
and
the
local
counties
can
levy
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
goods
coming
in,
that
are
in
the
mass
of
property
within
the
state.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
no,
it
did
not.
and
california
has
the
authority
to
exempt
goods,
if
it
does
it
in
an
evenhanded
manner.
if
the
state
of
california
wishes
to
exempt
certain
goods,
that's
fine.
i
think
they
have
to
exempt
them
in
a
manner
that
treats
all
goods,
be
they
interstate,
intrastate,
foreign,
they
have
to
regulate
evenhandedly.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
well,
you
get
into--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--that's
correct.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
because--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--however,
we
were
governed
at
that
point
in
time
by
decisional
law
saying
that
these
foreign
commerce
goods
had
to
be
exempted.
also,
we're
talking
about
a
different
clause,
too;
we're
talking
about
the
import-export
clause.
here,
we're
talking
about
the
commerce
clause.
analogies
are
good
but
they're
not
conclusive.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that's
right.
i
think
the
court
specifically
left
open
that
question,
though,
and
in
japan
lines
the
court
also
did
not
address
itself
to
the
inter-intrastate
argument.
it
was
a
strict
foreign
commerce
case.
all
i'm
really
saying
is
that
a
statute,
a
tax
statute
which
is
nondiscriminatory
on
its
face,
as
is
california's
ad
valorem
property
tax,
can
be
made
discriminatory
by
enacting
certain
exemptions
that
directly
affect
interstate
commerce,
as
section
225
does.
once
the
court,
california
or
u.s.
supreme
court,
finds
this
difference
in
treatment,
it
must
invoke
the
closest
scrutiny
under
the
commerce
clause,
to
see
why
the
statute
should
be
upheld.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
against
the
county?
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
i'm
not
sure
from
a
practical
procedural
standpoint
how
the
state
would
bring
the
statute
against
walter
fleisher.
i
could
see
a
situation
where--
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
--with
the
state.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
which
was
denied
by
the
state.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
well,
the
state
would
then
be
in
a
defendant's
posture.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
it
would
be
a
very
similar
argument.
now,
i
can't
see
the
state
simply
defending
a
lawsuit
and
raising
that
as
an
affirmative
defense
because
the
state
through
the
legislature
has
the
power
to
repeal
and
revise
the
statutes.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that's
true.
they
would
have
a
very
similar
argument
to
ours,
and
i
think
that
the
state,
also...
the
state
is
in
a
little
bit
different
position
from
public
entities.
however,
the
same
issues
and
the
same
arguments
regarding
standing
could
and
probably
would
be
raised
by
the
state.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
i'm
talking
about
the
state's
authority.
first
of
all,
under
the
civil
rights
act
it
is
not
a
person.
second
of
all,
the
state
has
the
authority
not
to
appropriate
funds
to
pay
damages.
the
counties
have
no
such
luxury.
the
counties
can
be
held
strictly
liable,
by
my
catch-22
analysis.
that's
an
aside
and
that
should
not
enter
too
much
into
the
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
at
this
point
by
saying
that
the
case
is
a
very
important
one.
however,
it's
a
more
important
case
from
a
standing
issue
than
it
is
from
a
commerce
clause
issue.
the
counties
have
to
be
allowed
to
raise
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
in
defending
the
actions
of
their
employees
and
themselves.
owen
v.
city
of
independence
taught
us
that
counties
have
a
negative
incentive
to
try
and
protect
all
persons'
civil
rights.
if
we
are
faced
with
strict
liability
under
an
owen
situation
and
faced
with
strict
liability
under
a
prudential
standing
situation,
there
will
be
no
incentive
for
public
officials
to
attempt
to
bend
over
backwards
to
err
on
the
side
of
protecting
civil
rights
of
others.
they
will
close
their
eyes
to
the
constitution
and
say,
well,
we'll
take
our
chances
under
an
owen
theory;
we'll
go
ahead
and
follow
the
statute
even
though
we
think
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
philip
h.
hickok
that's
true
because
they
can
always
justify
their
actions
on
a
defense
of
the
state
statute.
they
relied
on
a
previously
valid
state
statute.
therefore
they
are
not
going
to
have
any
individual
liability.
the
public
entity
will,
but
they
won't.
and
that
might
be
a
safer
course
of
conduct
for
them.
when
we
talk
about
a
commerce
clause
issue,
we're
talking
about
an
initial
look
to
see
whether
the
statute
regulates
evenhandedly.
if
it
does,
it
will
be
upheld
unless
there
is
an
excessive
burden.
if
it
doesn't
regulate
evenhandedly,
then
it
can
be
either
struck
down
as
being
per
se
invalid,
or
invalid
because
there
are
available
alternatives.
thank
you
very
much.
