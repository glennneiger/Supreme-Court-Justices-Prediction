justice
white
well,
mr.
manpearl,
i
take
it
that
as
far
as
the
courts
of
california
are
concerned,
they
could
permit
los
angeles
to
challenge
this
statute
if
they
wanted
to,
and
we
have
no
authority
to
tell
the
california
courts
not
to
entertain
a
challenge
to
this
statute
by
los
angeles
county,
do
we?
justice
white
you
may
be
quite
right
in
saying
that
we
have
no...
you
could
be
quite
right
in
saying
that
there
is
no
standing,
that
los
angeles
would
have
no
standing
in
this
court,
as
a
constitutional
matter.
but
i
don't
know
how
we
could
set
aside
the
judgment
of
a
court
of
appeals
in
california,
and
that
would
leave
you
behind
the
8-ball,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
but
not
in
the
state
courts.
they
don't
need
cases
or
controversies.
justice
white
you
mean
you're
asking
us
not
only
to...
what
you're
really
asking
us
to
do
is
to
vacate
the
judgments
of
the
california
courts?
on
the
standing
ground?
justice
white
in
a
state
court,
even?
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
a
question
of
state
law?
suppose
the
state
statute
said
specifically
that
the
counties
who
are
enforcing
state
property
tax
laws
can...
suppose
the
statute
specifically
gave
the
counties
standing
to
challenge
the
state
taxes,
state
statutes
in
the
state
courts,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here?
i
think
you
would
make
the
same
argument
as
far
as
your
being
able
to
come
here;
we
might
not
recognize
standing.
but
i
don't
know
how
you
could
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
county
couldn't
challenge
the
state.
justice
white
well,
in
effect,
the
california
courts
rejected
your
standing
claim
and
they
said--
justice
white
--as
a
matter
of
california
or
any
other
law,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
california
law,
los
angeles
county
has
standing.
it's
just
like
saying,
a
state
saying
that
in
our
state
a
taxpayer
suit
can
raise
a
federal
constitutional
issue.
and
that
would
be
wholly
acceptable
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
although
a
taxpayer
as
such
might
not
have
standing
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
the
federal
court,
or
specifically
this
court.
isn't
this
the
same
analogy?
justice
white
how
would
we
do
that?
how
could
we
do
that?
we
could
just
dismiss;
we
would
just
have
to
dismiss
and
leave
the
judgment
against
you.
justice
white
it
could
be
a
vacation.
you'd
vacate
the
judgment
because
you
would
argue
that
the
state
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
federal
question--
justice
white
--despite
the
fact
that
under
state
law
the
county
would
have
power
to
challenge
the
statute.
justice
white
and
a
question
of
standing?
justice
white
and
argue
that
my
duty
is
to
obey
the
federal
constitution
and
that
that's
what
it
means.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
the
standing
issue
be
resolved
in
your
favor
if
we
just
dismissed
this
action?
justice
white
leaving
the
judgment
below
upholding
your
standing
intact.
justice
white
if
we
just
dismissed
this
appeal
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
because
we
didn't
think
you
had
standing
as
a
federal
matter
in
this
court,
and
we
just
dismissed
the
appeal,
but
did
nothing
to
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeal,
you
would
win
the
case.
justice
white
why?
justice
white
no,
we
didn't
say
that.
we
didn't
say
that.
justice
white
we'd
just
say,
if
the
california
courts,
if
they
want
to,
could
still
continue
to
entertain
judgments
like
this,
cases
like
this,
defenses
like
this,
as
a
matter
of
california
law
they
would
let
their
courts
do
that.
justice
white
unless
they're
going
overseas.
justice
white
so
the
exception
does
apply
to
goods
going
through
california
that
are
bound
for
export?
justice
white
or
goods
coming
through
los
angeles
bound
for
hawaii?
justice
white
do
you
think
before
michelin
tire
that
california
constitutionally
could
have
levied
this
kind
of
a
tax
on
these
imported
goods?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
rule
before
michelin
was
just
bound
to
transit
goods?
it
wasn't,
was
it?
justice
white
it
was
bound
in
original
packages,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
then
michelin
tire
held
what?
justice
white
but
it
didn't
rule
that
it
couldn't
exempt
them.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think,
before
michelin,
if
california
had
just
exempted
imported
goods
from
the
tax,
that
they
would
have
had
to
have
taxed...
they
would
have
had
to
have
exempted
all
other
goods
too,
from
other
states,
for
example?
justice
white
before
michelin
they
would
have
had
to
exempt
goods
in
their
original
packages
coming
from
abroad.
justice
white
do
you
think
they
would
also
have
had
to
exempt
goods
in
their
original
packages
from
other
states
bound
for
other
states?
justice
white
well,
that
would
be
a
burden
on
commerce.
justice
white
yes,
but
before
michelin
you
could
have
enforced
them
both
by
saying,
you
can't
tax
the
foreign
goods,
and
live
up
the
export-import
clause.
and
to
comply
with
the
commerce
clause,
you
should
not
discriminate
against
non-international
goods.
justice
white
well,
if
the
tax
collection
people
have
had
an
opinion
from
the
attorney
general
that
their
exemption
was
unconstitutional
and
the
state
then,
because
the
tax
collection
people
are
supposed
to
listen
to
the
attorney
general,
they
don't
give
the
exemption.
justice
white
well,
now,
isn't
it
true,
though,
that
this
exemption
discriminates
between
interstate
commerce
and
foreign
commerce?
justice
white
and
don't
you
have
to
just
say
that
the
state
is
empowered
to
make
that
kind
of
a
discrimination?
justice
white
the
state
is.
justice
white
well,
suppose
california,
though,
taxed
the
goods
that
are
bound
from
oregon
to
utah
but
didn't
tax
goods
that
are
bound
from
washington
for
utah,
and
both
of
them
came
through.
would
you
think
that
would
be
bad
on
commerce
grounds,
or
equal
protection
grounds,
or
both?
