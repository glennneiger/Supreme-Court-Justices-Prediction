justice
rehnquist
and
the
exemption
was
enacted
by
the
california
legislature,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
so
that
whether
the
attorney
general
of
california
is
here
or
not
presumably
it's
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
constitutional
presumption
of
validity
unless
your
opponent
can
show
some
constitutional
defect.
justice
rehnquist
and
how
are
california's
counties
created?
are
they
created
by
the
legislature?
justice
rehnquist
so
los
angeles
county
is
nothing
more
than
a
creature
of
the
state?
justice
rehnquist
a
case
or
controversy
type
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
goes
to
the
merits.
justice
rehnquist
if
the
standing
question
is
resolved
in
your
favor
and,
as
justice
stevens
has
suggested,
we
find
that
the
county
has
no
standing
to
challenge
a
state
statute,
we
don't
then
go
further
and
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
rehnquist
but
in
our
other
cases
regarding
standing
such
as
arlington
v.
village
of
metropolitan
heights,
and
the
one
we
decided
the
year
before,
we
haven't
gotten
to
the
merits
of
the
claims.
we
have
simply
said
there
was
not
sufficient
standing,
and
therefore
we
wouldn't
decide
them.
justice
rehnquist
but
we
are
not
bound
under
federal
law
by
their
rulings
as
to
standing.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
trucking
company
had
simply
been
a
subsidiary
and
a
creature
of
the
state
of
wisconsin?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
wisconsin
decided,
we're
going
to
socialize
our
trucking
industry,
and
the
trucking
company
was
simply
an
arm
or
a
creature
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
and
it
didn't
like
what...
it
lost
the
fight
in
the
wisconsin
legislature
and
so
it
came
here?
justice
rehnquist
but
in
my
hypothetical
the
person
who
would
be
saying
it
is
a
creature
of
the
state
just
like
the
baltimore
case
in
1933.
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
the
meaning
of
standing,
what
you
have
just
said.
justice
rehnquist
counsel,
what
if
the
state
of
california
permitted
friendly
bondholder
suits
to
establish
the
validity
of
bonds
so
that
someone
who
was
simply
a
person
with
no
intention
of
buying
a
particular
water
bond
issue
but
simply
said
he
was
a
plaintiff
and
wanted
to
find
out
whether
these
bonds
were
valid
or
not,
he
could
sue
the
district
and
the
california
courts
would
permit
that
case
to
be
litigated
up
through
them?
do
you
think
that
that
would
confer
jurisdiction
in
any
way
upon
this
court?
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
the
baltimore
case
that
your
opponent
relies
on?
justice
rehnquist
then
they
are
both
attacking
a
statute
passed
by
the
state
legislature,
the
same
legislature
which
created
them?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
a
different
legislature
in
time,
but
the
same
body
which
created
them.
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
we
reject
that
distinction
several
years
ago
in
a
civil
rights
case
involving
1988,
where
the
state
was
claiming
its
counties
were
different
than
the--
--reitman
v.
mulkey.
yes.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
reason
for
the
lawsuits
is
a
statute
passed
by
your
own
legislature.
justice
rehnquist
well,
no
litigant
in
guaranteed
a
forum.
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
baltimore
case
has
stood
on
the
books
for
50
years,
as
you've
said.
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it's
untenable.
all
it
means
is
that
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
will
stand
and
perhaps
in
some
other
litigation
this
court
will
reach
the
merits.
justice
rehnquist
probably
by
some
other
litigation.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
of
california
had
brought
this
action?
or
did
the
action--
justice
rehnquist
--no,
against
walter
fleisher.
do
you
think
all
of
the
same
answers
that
you
gave
to
the
standing
question
would
be
relevant?
the
state
of
california
simply
says,
we
don't
think
the
statute
our
legislature
passed
was
constitutional?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there
was
an
application
for
refund--
justice
rehnquist
--with
the
state.
justice
rehnquist
which
was
denied
by
the
state.
justice
rehnquist
right.
justice
rehnquist
even
though
we're
public
officials
who
are
presumably
bound
by
the
statute?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
of
almost
every
event
that
happens,
every
day,
in
human
life.
someone
is
before
the
court
complaining
about
it.
