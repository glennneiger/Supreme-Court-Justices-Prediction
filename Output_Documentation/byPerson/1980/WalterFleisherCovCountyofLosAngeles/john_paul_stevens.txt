justice
stevens
mr.
manpearl,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
you
may
be
arguing
against
your
client's
interest,
because
if
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
federal
claim,
maybe
we
have
a
duty
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
and
maybe
we
should
look
at
your
adversary's
argument
for
that.
it
seems
to
me
you've
taken
opposite
positions
on
the
case.
justice
stevens
well,
you're
arguing
there
is
no
proper
federal
question
presented
in
this
case--
justice
stevens
--which
a
federal
court
has
power
to
decide,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stevens
mr.
manpearl,
are
you
saying
that
if
this
case
had
been
brought
by
a
competing
importer
of
personal
property...
i
don't
know
just
what
your
client
warehouses...
that
all
the
goods
came
from
arizona
instead
of
from
across
the
pacific
ocean
somewhere,
and
that
person
said,
well,
i
can't
make
as
much
money,
because
he
gets
his
tax
exemption
and
therefore
there's
no
profit
margin
left
for
me,
that
he
would
prevail?
justice
stevens
then
what's
the
point
of
your
argument
that
the--
justice
stevens
--you're
really
arguing
standing
again,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
indicated,
then.
justice
stevens
but
do
the
merits
depend
on
who
was
raising
the
claim?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
we're
talking
about
automobiles
being
imported
from
japan,
and
all
the
competing
automobile
companies
said,
well,
they
get
a
tax
exemption.
that
enables
us
to
undersell
them
in
the
automobile
market
throughout
the
state.
would
they
have
a
different
case
than
your
client
here?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
you're
saying,
the
only
relief
is
not
to
take
away
the
exemption
but
to
grant
the
exemption
to
everybody?
justice
stevens
mr.
manpearl,
supposing
the
exemption
instead
of
being
for
goods
of
foreign
source,
said,
for
all
goods
of
foreign
source
and
from
all
states
east
of
the
mississippi
river.
would
there
be
any
burden
there?
justice
stevens
that's
what
they
say
we've
got
here.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
stevens
well,
then
instead
of
all
goods
east
of
the
mississippi
river,
all
goods
that
don't
have
their
origin
in
the
state
of
california.
say,
the
exemption
for
all
goods
that
are
shipped,
that
do
not
originate
in
california,
then.
would
there
be
no
discrimination--
justice
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
even
if
before
michelin,
the
export-import
clause,
had
required
the
exemption,
you'd
still
have
the
same
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
wouldn't
you?
yes.
and
therefore,
really,
if
your
view
is
correct,
prior
to
michelin
there
was
a
requirement
that
the
exemption
be
given
to
all
foreign
and
interstate
commerce.
you
could
have
enforced
both
clauses
that
way.
