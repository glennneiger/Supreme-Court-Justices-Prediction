in
any
event,
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
lower
rate
periods?
justice
blackmun
according
to
the
courts
below,
have
you
conceded
that
a
50
percent
tax
would
be?
justice
blackmun
that's
really
all
you
want,
is
a
chance
to
prove
your
case?
justice
blackmun
general
greely,
help
me
out
on
one
detail.
i
take
it
that
this
tax
flows
into
the
general
coffers
of
the
state;
it
is
not
allocated
to
the
various
counties
and
districts
as
is
true,
say,
in
alaska.
