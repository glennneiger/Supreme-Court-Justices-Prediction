justice
stewart
in
complete
auto,
the
tax
there
was
a
state
tax
imposed...
as
i
remember,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
mistaken...
upon
what
was
concededly
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
stewart
and
the
question
was
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
any
tax
at
all,
was
it
not?
justice
stewart
tax
it
at
all,
at
all.
justice
stewart
and
here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
concedes
the
constitutional
power
of
the
state
to
impose
a
severance
tax.
justice
stewart
and
the
question
is
how
much.
justice
stewart
and
it's
a
different
question
or
maybe--
justice
stewart
you
might
have
an
equal
protection
clause
problem.
