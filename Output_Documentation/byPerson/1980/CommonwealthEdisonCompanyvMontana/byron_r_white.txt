justice
white
well,
why
isn't
it
being
paid
by
montana
consumers
too?
justice
white
well,
it's
probably
resulted
in
lowering
of
some
other
taxes
or
at
least--
justice
white
--they've
had
some
increases?
justice
white
what
if
we
agreed
with
you?
what
would
you
contemplate
we
would
say
if
we
agreed
with
you?
namely,
that
under
brady
and
the
auto
case
that
that
fourth
category
assumes
that
a
tax
can
be
too
high
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
white
and
that
therefore
you
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
prove
that
it's
too
high?
justice
white
but
then,
the
premise
for
that
is
that
it
may
be
that
30
percent
is
too
high.
we
have
to
at
least
decide
that.
justice
white
and
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
white
you're
going
to...
you
would
convince
the
court
of
that?
justice
white
well,
a
fair
proportion
of
it
doesn't
belong
to
montana
anyway,
does
it?
justice
white
and
so
the
restoration
is
performed
under
federal
leases?
justice
white
but
don't
you
agree
that
if
congress
passed
a
statute
that
specifically
approved
the
montana
tax,
that
you
would
lose
this
case?
suppose
someone
sent
a
message
over
today
and
it
said
that
congress
has
just
passed
a
law
and
the
president
has
just
signed
it
approving
the
montana
tax?
justice
white
no,
probably
not.
justice
white
but
congress
can
certainly
eliminate
the
constitutional
issue
if
it
wants
to.
justice
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
under
the
complete
auto
case,
would
a
tax
be
subject
to
judicial
review
of
any
kind
at
some
point
as
it
got
larger
and
larger
and
larger?
what
if
this
were
twice
as
large
as
it
is?
justice
white
is
that
because
you--
justice
white
--but
you
think
this
is
just
a
local
activity
that
you
then--
justice
white
--and
that
complete
auto
isn't
even
implicated
because
this
isn't
a
tax
on
commerce?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
that,
as...
i
take
it
the
united
states
doesn't
agree
with
you
on
that.
justice
white
the
united
states
suggests
that
complete
auto
does
apply
but
the
test
is
just
satisfied.
