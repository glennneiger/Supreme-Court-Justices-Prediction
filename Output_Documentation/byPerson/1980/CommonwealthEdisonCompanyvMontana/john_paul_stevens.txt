mr.
rogers,
what
sort
of
expenditures
in
your
judgment
would
justify
it?
what
if
they
want
to
build
a
couple
of
hundred
very
large
parks,
municipal
zoos,
and
all
sorts
of
public
things
they
never
have
done
before,
would
that
be
justifiable?
justice
stevens
you'd
say
that
the
limiting
principle
is
that
the
tax
revenues
must
somehow
or
other
be
related
to
the
expenditures
of
the
state
that
are
fairly
related
to
mining,
but
the
tax
may
not
support
any
other
public
purpose
like
unemployment
compensation
or
public
parks,
environmental
matters,
or?
justice
stevens
880
thousand.
justice
stevens
that's
how
many
people
there'll
be
there
if
they
can
keep
all
this
money.
justice
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
though,
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
what
is
your
response
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
the
best
arm
of
government
to
draft
the
right
standard
is
congress
rather
than
this
court?
justice
stevens
--general
greely,
let
me
just
take
a
step
further
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked
you.
supposing
your
opponent's
assessment
is
generally
correct,
that
this
is
an
extremely
profitable
tax
in
a
way
for
the
state
and
after
you
win
this
case,
assuming
you
do,
you
then
reassess
your
budgetary
consideration
and
decide
you
don't
need
any
other
taxes
at
all,
you
repeal
all
your
other
taxes
and
leave
your
present
tax
standing
in
effect.
would
that
raise
any
constitutional
question
in
your
judgment?
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
be
precisely
the
same
challenge
here,
that
under
the
last
prong
of
the
complete
auto
transit
case
that
there
is
some
integrity,
that
requirement
of
some
relationship
between
the
tax
and
something
the
state
does
and
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
prong
means
either,
but
if
it
means
something--
