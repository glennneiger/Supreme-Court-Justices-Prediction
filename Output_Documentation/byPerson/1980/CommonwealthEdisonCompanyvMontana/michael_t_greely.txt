mr.
michael
t.
greely
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
focus
the
court's
attention
today
on
the
actual
allegations
that
the
appellants
declared
in
their
complaint
because
there
have
been
a
lot
of
facts
bandied
about
both
in
the
briefs
and
suggested
today
by
counsel
for
the
appellants
as
to
what
the
allegations
were
and
what
kind
of
facts
the
appellants
could
prove
if
they'd
gone
to
trial.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
basically
under
the
commerce
clause
the
appellants
have
alleged
that
the
mined
coal
in
montana
is
destined
for
outside
the
state,
that
the
coal
is
taxed
at
20
to
30
percent
of
the
value.
actually
the
effective
rate
of
the
tax
is
22
percent,
since
the
production
costs,
the
taxes
on
production
costs
are
backed
out
before
the
severance
tax
applies.
and
thirdly,
they've
alleged
that
the
revenues
that
are
anticipated
by
montana
in
the
fiscal
years
'78
and
'79
are
$34
and
$40
million
respectively
for
all
coal,
not
just
the
coal
that
they're
mining,
but
for
all
coal
that
will
be
mined
in
montana
in
those
years.
and
then
they
say,
therefore,
that
our
tax
is
not
fairly
related
to
the
services
and
protections
provided
by
the
state
of
montana,
but
in
their
briefs
and
today
in
oral
argument
we
hear
that
montana's
legitimate
needs
have
already
been
met,
and
we
hear
that
the
local
impact
costs
from
appellants'
activities
only
amount
to
two
cents
a
ton
whereas
our
tax
amounts
to
$2
or
more
a
ton.
and
we
also
hear
that
the
tax
bears
no
relationship
to
the
legitimate
needs
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
true,
but
that's
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
what
i'm
suggesting
here
is
some
of
these
things
that
have
been
made
in
statements
but
not
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
all
factual
allegations--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--but
not
conclusions
of
law.
essentially,
what
the
district
court
held,
as
i
would...
under
montana
law,
would
be
that
under
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
no
facts
that
the
plaintiffs
could
have
proved
would
have
given
them
a
right
for
a
trial
under
the
commerce
clause
claims.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
are
you
talking
about
a
state
tax
as
a
substitute
for
all
other
state
taxes?
i
think
there's
broad
discretion
in
the
legislature
as
to
how
to
raise
money.
i
think
the
constitutional
challenge
to
that
type
of
a
tax
would
be
the
same
that
we
have
on
other
areas,
whether
there
is
a
due
process
question
or
whether
there
was
a
commerce
clause,
possibly
a
commerce
clause
question.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
legislature
decides
to
have
one
tax
is
not
by
itself
significant.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
assuming
there
was
no
other
discriminations
or
anything
else,
i
think
that
that
would
be
something
that
could
feasibly,
if
that
was
the
decision
of
the
legislature,
could
feasibly
be
upheld.
it
depends
upon
what
the
constitutional
challenge
was.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
oh,
i
suppose
that
that's
possible,
certainly.
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
the
basis
for
the
challenge
would
be.
certainly
if
it
was
suggested
that
the
distinction,
the
taxpayer
distinction,
the
class
distinctions
were
not
proper,
it
might
be
an
equal
protection
question
or
something
which
the
courts
could
certainly
take
a
look
at.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
that's
true.
and
certainly
if
that
was
done
on
just
on
one
industry
there
may
be
a
question.
but
if
you're
suggesting
that
this
tax
is
such
a
tax,
the
severance
tax
in
montana
applies
equally
to
any
coal
that's
mined
in
montana
whether
it's
to
be
consumed
in
montana
or
without
of
montana,
there's
no
commerce
clause
discrimination
question
about
the
severance
tax
on
our
coal
since
it
applies
equally.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
yes,
absolutely.
that
sounds...
if
that's
the
factual
situation
in
that
case,
there
could
be
a
commerce
clause
discrimination
problem
which
i
don't
believe
is
present
here
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
it's
understandable
that
the
complete
auto
test
and
the
commerce
clause
test
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
rates
of
the
tax,
and
we
have
contended,
as
we
did
in
the
lower
courts,
that
we
could
tax
100
percent,
1,000
percent,
not
because
we
want
to
or
that
that
would
be
an
intelligent
thing
to
do,
because
obviously
there's
market
limitations
and
there's
other
limitations.
what
we're
talking
about
is
as
a
commerce
clause
matter
that
the
rate
of
a
tax
is
not
important.
there
could
be
some
point
when
the
tax,
for
instance,
will
quit--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--bringing
in
revenue...
quit
bringing
in
revenue
and
actually
maybe
precluded
the
activity,
where
you
might
possibly
have
a
due
process
clause.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
absolutely.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
if
complete
auto
is--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--yes,
that's
essentially
correct.
that's
our
position,
where
we're
relying
on
heisler.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
we're
citing
heisler
for
the
proposition
that
essentially
that
a
severance
tax
which
is
a
local
activity
is
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
obviously,
at
that
time
there
was
a
per
se
rule
that
has
possibly
been
somewhat
eroded
to
date,
but
the
basic
holding
there
was
that
mining
because
of
the
nature
of
the
activity
was
not
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
i
think
if
you
apply
the
facts
of
our
case
to
complete
auto,
that
we
meet
the
tests
of
complete
auto,
in
fact,
the
appellants
have
conceded
that;
for
the
fact
that
they
say
that
we
do
meet
that
test,
and
that
our
rate,
if
we
had
a
rate,
a
lower
rate,
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem
whatsoever.
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
this
from
complete
auto
is
that
it
has
a
much
higher
rate.
and
then
in
addition
to
that
they
say,
okay,
the
fair
relation
test.
well,
i
guess
the
question
we're
saying
is
that
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
what
the
fair
relation
test
means
but
i
know
what
it
doesn't
mean
and
i
know
it
doesn't
mean
what
the
plaintiffs
say
it
does.
and
that
is
that
under
a
fairly
related
test
under
complete
auto
that
the
courts
will
somehow
adjudicate
the
rate
of
our
tax
and
put
a
dollar-to-dollar
figure.
in
other
words,
the
courts
are
supposed
to
add
up
our
trained
work
force,
the
number
of
roads
we
have
in
the
state,
especially
those
that
may
be
applying
to
the
appellants
at
the
mine
sites;
that
we
figure
out
how
much
fire
protection,
we
figure
out
what
the
social
consequences
will
be.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
mammoth
judicial
undertaking
and
all
the
cases
essentially
say,
this
is
a
legislative
prerogative,
this
is
a
political
question.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
think
that
certainly
taxes
are
a
way
of
discouraging
activities.
i
think
the
magnano
case
that
had
to
do
with
oleomargarine
and
the
pittsburgh
parking
case,
i
think
that
there
are
cases
in
which
taxes
are
used
to
discourage
activities.
but
i
don't
think
it
becomes
a
commerce
clause
question
unless
the
activities
actually
stop
or
the
product
is
prohibited
from
being
distributed.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
it
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
states
could
tax
involving
interstate
commerce.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
right.
that
activity--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
the
question
they're
asking
this
court
to
determine.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
but
they're
asking
this
court
to
determine
that
question.
and
the
courts,
to
my
knowledge,
have
never
done
that
because
to
tax
is
an
assessment
of
benefits,
and
there's
no
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
that
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
quid
pro
quo
tax...
that
the
amount
of
the
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
state
of
montana
and
their
mining
activities,
whatever
damage
they're
doing.
and
the
problem
we
have,
of
course,
with
even
going
to
trial
on
that
is
that
the
damages
that
they
are
doing
and
could
be
done
could
be
things
that
we
couldn't
make
a
factual
determination
on:
the
esthetic
value,
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
wildlife,
what's
going
to
happen
30
years
from
now,
at
what
point
in
time
do
we
start
adding
up
all
these
things?
do
we
wait
for
a
few
years
and
see
what
happens
or
do
we
do
it
now?
and
what
we're
saying
is,
is
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
require
any
such
quid
pro
quo
tax,
that
a
tax
is
an
assessment
of
benefits;
that
if
a
corporation
doesn't
have
school
children,
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
don't
have
to
pay
school
bonds.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
don't
know.
i
guess
it
would
depend
on
how
that
particular
tax
which...
i'm
assuming
that
the
tax
would
be
constitutional
if
there
were
no
other
taxes.
the
fact
that
you
would
repeal
all
other
taxes
and
just
leave
one,
i
don't
see
how
that
by
itself
could
be
a
constitutional
question.
i
guess
i
don't
know
what
the
challenge
to
that
would
be.
assuming
that
it's
otherwise
constitutional--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--yes,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
that
even
though
we
can't
say
maybe
exactly
what
it
means,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
meaningless
test.
for
instance,
the
court
could
have
intended
by
that
that
the
states
must
impose,
if
they
impose
taxes
they
must
allow
the
taxpayers
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services,
and
the
appellants
in
this
case
haven't
alleged
that
they
don't...
that
they're
not
capable
of
benefiting
from
the
services
that
montana
provides.
perhaps
the
court
meant
that
the
tax
must
somehow
be
related
to
the
activities
of
the
taxpayer
in
the
state.
and
i
think
clearly
that's
the
case
when
you
attach
the
tax
to
the
percentage
of
the
value
of
the
mined
coal.
now,
i
suppose...
another
thing,
they
suggested
that
all
the
states
could
meet
this
test,
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
that's
probably
true,
because
i
think
most
of
the
state
taxes,
certainly
those
that
are
a
severance
tax,
would
meet
this
kind
of
a
fairly
related
test
and
that
unless
the
court
were
to
find,
for
instance,
that
montana
taxed
the
net
federal
income
of
the
coal
companies
as
opposed
to
anything
that
relates
to
coal,
maybe
that
wouldn't
be
related
to
what
the
activities
were.
but
getting
back
to
our
main
point,
the
fact
is
that
the
fairly
related
test
does
not
require
a
balancing
of
benefits
and
burdens
of
providing
certain
services
for
the
taxpayers
other
than
the
ones
that
they
would
generally
be
entitled
to
by
living
in
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
there
possibly
could
be
judicial
curiosity
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
factual
a
situation
would
require
a
striking
of
the
tax
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
wouldn't
require
a
striking
of
the
tax
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
and
no
tax,
to
my
knowledge...
i
mean,
there's
general,
this
is
a
general
excise
tax,
this
is
for
the
general...
there's
no,
there
has
been
no
indication
by
the
state
legislature
that
the
reason
for
this
tax
is
just
to
take
care
of
those
dangerous
things
that
may
happen
to
the
state
of
montana
because
of
the
impact
of
coal
mining.
clearly,
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
was
considered.
it's
also
to
raise
general
revenue
for
the
state
of
montana.
their
concern
about
the
impacts...
we're
still
concerned
about
the
impacts
of
strip
mining
in
the
state
of
montana,
but
that's
not
the
only
purpose
of
the
tax.
we
use
some
of
it
for
general
fund,
we
use
some
of
it
for
general
education,
alternative
energy
sources,
and
so
forth.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
tax
could
not
otherwise
be
questioned,
when
all
the
rest
of
the
taxes...
i
don't
believe
that
by
eliminating
other
taxes
that
you
suddenly
make
one
tax
unconstitutional;
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
connection
would
be.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
possibly.
possibly,
that
you're
going
to
ask
one
group
of
taxpayers
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
taxes
throughout
the
state.
however,
it's
not
necessarily...
in
the
carmichael
case,
for
instance,
the
corporations
who
happened
to
have
full
employment
were,
in
essence
were
paying
a
tax
that
they
didn't
need
to
benefit
from,
because
they
kept
their
employees
on
the
job.
but
some
of
the
other
corporations
who
had
to
pay
less
of
the
tax
because
they
had
some
of
their
people
were
unemployed,
so
then
they
did
it
on
the
basis
of
how
many
workers
you
had
in
your
plant,
actually
ended
up
benefiting
because
they
paid
less
tax
but
their
unemployed
people
got
more
benefits.
i
think
the
key
thing
here
is
that
this
tax
is
not
benefits-burdens
or
a
tit-for-tat
quid-pro-quo
tax.
the
fairly
related
test
doesn't
require
this.
a
tax
is
a
general
assessment,
it's
for
the
common
good
government.
i
think
if
this
court
were
to
look
into
rates
of
taxes
under
the
commerce
clause,
that
you
would
be
going
against
the
fundamental
proposition
as
i
understand
the
taxing
laws
and
the
ability
of
the
state
to
tax,
and
that
is
that
they
raise
taxes
for
the
common
good,
and
that
the
courts
don't
normally
go
into
an
inquiry
as
to
what
the
legislature
based
its
decision
on.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
there
is
a...
we
have
what
we
call
the
coal
board,
which
is
a
board
appointed
by
the
governor,
and
they
have
authority
to
distribute
a
certain
amount
of
money,
and
applications
are
made
from
the
local
governments
in
the
area
where
the
strip
mining
takes
place,
and
those
applications
for
grant
monies
are
determined
by
the
board
and
money
would
be
given
to
those
localities
for
various
things
such
as
schools,
fire
and
police
protection,
education,
or
whatever.
but
there
is
no
direct
grant.
there
is
a
percentage
of
the
fund
that's
set
aside
for
local
impacts,
and
that
percentage
is
8.75
percent.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
