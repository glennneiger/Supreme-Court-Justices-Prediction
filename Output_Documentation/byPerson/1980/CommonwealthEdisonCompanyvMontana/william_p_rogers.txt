mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
challenge
to
a
montana
tax
based
on
the
commerce
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause.
the
tax
was
enacted
in
1975.
prior
to
1975
there
was
an
array
of
taxes
in
montana,
including
a
net
proceeds
tax,
a
property
tax,
license
tax,
and
a
severance
tax.
in
addition,
the
state
received
royalties
from
the
federal
government
to
cover
the
impact
of
mining
coal
in
montana.
and
the
coal
companies...
mindful
of
the
problems
they
had
with
anaconda
copper
and
earlier,
provided
that
the
coal
companies
had
to
reclaim
the
land
as
they
mined
and
they
had
to
post
substantial
bonds
to
guarantee
that
the
land
would
be
properly
reclaimed.
so
presumably,
the
taxes
on
the
books
at
that
time
were
sufficient
to
meet
the
cost
of
the
services
provided
by
montana.
in
fact...
and
i
point
out
that
this
tax
was
a
1975
tax...
in
1973
the
severance
tax
had
been
increased
from
10
cents
a
ton,
based
on
btu,
to
approximately
34
cents
a
ton.
shortly
thereafter,
the
arab
oil
embargo
occurred
and
it
became
clear
that
the
nation
was
facing
a
very
serious
energy
crisis.
so
montana
saw
an
opportunity.
montana
has
more
than
25
percent
of
the
coal
reserves
in
the
united
states
and
it
started
to
plan
how
it
could
maximize
its
taxes.
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
done
was
exemplified
by
one
of
its
sponsors
in
the
house
of
representatives
when
he
said,
the
arabs
have
the
oil
but
we
have
the
coal.
most
of
this
coal
is
shipped
out
of
the
state;
90
percent
of
it,
in
fact.
and
the
coal
is
leased
under
long-term
contracts,
so
the
discussion
in
the
legislature
for
the
most
part
involved
the
question,
how
much
would
the
market
xx?
the
legislature
was
advised
that
the
amount
of
the
tax
would
not
be
subject
to
any
judicial
review.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
we're
not.
we're
claiming
that,
actually,
montana
in
this
cases
did
not
meet
the
tests
of
complete
auto
and
washington
stevedoring.
we
don't
claim
that
they're
not
entitled
to
tax.
we
think
that
the
tax
because
it
was
specifically
tailored
to
fall
on
customers
outside
the
state
has
to
be
fairly
related
to
the
services
provided
by
montana.
the
result
of
this
tax--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--none.
and
i
might
say,
parenthetically,
there
would
not
have
been.
it
was
the
amount
of
this
tax
that--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--no,
we
have
not,
your
honor.
that
is
a
misstatement.
we
said
that
we
could
not
imagine
that
a
tax,
that
a
severance
tax
of
12-1/2
percent
would
ever
be
more
than
enough.
we
think
that
probably
in
this
case
a
tax...
well,
my
studies
show
that
no
matter
how
they
figured
the
cost
of
the
services
that
might
be
necessary
to
provide
for
additional
mining
of
coal,
that
it
could
never
amount
to
more
than
10
cents
a
ton
additional.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
i
would
not
think
so,
your
honor.
we
think
that
in
a
case
like
this...
and
i'll
come
to
this
in
just
a
moment...
that
it
was
deliberately
tailored
to
fall
on
people
outside
the
state
and
it's
under
long-term
contracts...
the
coal
companies
couldn't
get
out
of
those
contracts...
plus
the
fact
that
montana
has
25
percent
of
all
the
nation's
coal
resources
and
it
has
over
50
percent
of
the
low
sulfur
coal
in
the
united
states.
now,
we
say,
under
these
circumstances,
because
it's
a
tailored
tax
and
because
it
falls
to
a
large
extent...
90
percent
of
the
tax
is
paid
for
by
people
in
other
states...
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
trial
to
show
that
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
montana
show
that
they
need
this
money
for
the
services
that
are
provided
by
montana.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
all.
now,
it's
interesting,
too,
that
the...
let
me
say
before
i
get
to
that,
so
far
this
tax
has
amounted...
this
tax;
not
the
other
taxes;
this
tax...
has
amounted
to
about
$200
million.
they
expect
the
tax
will
amount
to
over
a
billion
dollars
in
the
next
ten
years
and
several
billions
of
dollars
in
the
next
20
years.
and
we're
prepared
to
prove
these
things.
we
have
had
a
comprehensive
study
made
which
showed
to
our
satisfaction
that
there's
no
justification
for
this
tax.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
really
can't
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
i
can't
imagine
that
any
state
would
have
attempted
to
do
what
they've
done
here.
let
me
say,
too,
that
montana
amended
their
constitution
to
provide
a
trust
fund
to
put
the
money
in,
and
they're
putting
one-half
of
all
this
money
in
a
trust
fund.
they
don't
make
any
real
effort
to
claim
that
they
need
the
money.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
as
we
read
complete
auto,
and
washington
stevedoring,
the
court
has
held
that
there
are
four
prongs
to
the
test:
one,
the
nexus
test;
one,
the
apportionment
test,
neither
of
which
come
into
play
here;
third,
the
discrimination
test,
and
this
case
clearly
shows
the
discrimination
here.
let
me
just
read
what
the
senator
said
who
proposed
the
tax,
if
i
can
find
it.
but
anyway,
he
pointed
out
that...
and
this
is
in
the
legislative
history,
that
this
tax
was
going
to
be
paid
for
initially
by
the
coal
companies
but
because
of
the
contracts
it
would
be
immediately
paid
for
by
the
utilities,
who
in
turn
under
the
law
passed
that
on
to
the
customers.
so,
the
tax
is
being
paid
for
by
the
customers
in
chicago,
in
detroit,
minneapolis,
and
other
cities
and
towns.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
it
is
to
some
extent,
of
course,
but
it's...
they
get
so
much
money
back
from
the
remainder
of
the
tax,
it's
for...
let
me
say
this,
justice
white.
this
is
the
most
popular
tax
in
the
history
of
montana,
believe
me.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it
has--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--it
has
resulted
in
considerable
lowering
of
taxes,
and
they
plan
in
the
years
ahead
not
to
have
to
pay
any
taxes
at
all.
now,
if
complete
auto
and
washington
stevedoring
mean
anything...
and
i
think
this
court
intended
those
cases
to
mean
something...
it
means
for
the
state,
once
it
decides
to
tax
interstate
commerce,
has
to
do
it
in
a
nondiscriminatory
way,
in
a
way
that's
fairly
related
to
the
services
of
protection
provided
by
the
state.
we're
prepared
to
show
that
this
tax
amounts
to
between
$2
and
$4
a
ton
and
that
the
state
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
justify
more
than
20
cents
a
ton,
if
they
take
into
account
schools
and
roads
and
hospitals
and
everything
else
they
might
claim.
furthermore,
because
of
the
trust
fund,
they
know
they
can't
establish
that.
i
mean,
the
papers
in
montana
are
full
of
how
do
they
spend
the
other
50
percent?
they
haven't
found
out
a
way
to
spend
the
other
50
percent
in
any
manner
that's
consistent
with
the--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
right.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
we'll--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--we're
going
to
convince
the
court
of
that.
secondly,
i
don't
think
that
the
legislatures
of
the
states
will
defy
the
standards
established
by
this
court.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
oh,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
you
have
established
a
standard,
a
fairly
related
standard.
you
say
in
complete
auto
that
if
a
state...
first,
you
say
clearly
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
tax
interstate
commerce,
and
in
complete
auto
you
wipe
away
the
distinctions
about
labels.
and
you
said,
let's
consider
the
practical
effect
of
a
tax,
which
seems
to
most
lawyers,
it's
a
very
sensible
position.
now,
the
practical
effects
of
this
tax...
and
you
don't
have
to
take
my
word
for
it,
you
can
look
at
the
legislative
history...
is,
in
the
first
instance,
to
transfer
the
tax
from
people
in
montana
to
out-of-state
taxpayers
who
obviously
were
not
part
of
the
political
process.
second--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--yes,
of
course,
but
they
get
back
so
much
in
the
rest
of
it
that,
as
i
said,
they've
very
happy
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
your
honor--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--no,
justice
marshall,
that
is
not.
my
argument
is
that
when
a
tax,
as
this
one
does,
affects
interstate
commerce--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--that
it
should
be
fairly
related
to
the
cost
and
services
provided
by
the
states,
a
rough
equivalence.
we
don't
say
that--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--no,
your
honor,
we
think
that--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--well,
what
we
would
expect,
your
honor,
is
as
follows.
in
this
case
the
legislature
has
no
record--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--i
guess
we
all
would.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
in
this
case
there
was
no
legislative
history,
no
attempt
by
the
legislature,
really,
to
justify
the
amount
of
the
tax.
secondly,
they
really
tailored
it,
as
i've
said,
to
fall
on
people
outside
the
state.
third,
they
realized
there
was
a
national
emergency
and
they
could
take
advantage
of
the
crisis.
now,
we
would
expect
that
if
we
tried
the
case
we
can
show
these
things.
we
would
expect
the
court
merely
to
say
that
the
legislature
had
not
followed
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court,
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
where
the
facts
are
specifically
tailored,
there
should
be
special
scrutiny
given--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--yes,
but
in
this
case,
as
i
have
said,
the
state
has
already
provided
for
reclamation
cost,
plus
the
fact
that
the
amount
of
land
that's
involved
in
this
is
very
small.
montana
has
145,000
square
miles.
the
amount
of
land
that's
involved
in
this
strip
mining
is
five
square
miles.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
about
75
percent
of
this
coal
is
federal
coal.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
fact
is,
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
no
justification
for
this
tax.
now,
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
constitutionally,
that
the
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
a
trial
to
prove
that.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
maybe
i
should
amend
that
to
say
that
there
was
no
justification
made
for
it
in
the
legislature.
maybe
they
can
justify
it
at
a
trial,
and
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
we
intended
to
get
discovery
in
this
case
and
we
were
enjoined
from
any
discovery.
so,
if
montana
has
a
justification,
and
i'm
certainly
prepared
to
accept
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
it,
they
certainly
didn't
make
it
in
the
legislative
history.
if
they
could
justify
it
at
a
trial,
fine,
but
i
think
the
courts
are
too--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--well,
i
think
that
because
of
the
other
taxes
that
they've
already
imposed
on
the
mining
of
coal,
the
taxes
would
have
to
be
in
some
way
related
to
the
impact
of
additional
mining.
but
we
would
be
prepared
to
say
that
all
direct
costs,
all
indirect
costs--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--no,
justice
stevens,
i
would
not
say
that.
i
think
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
consider
those
things
but
not
such
a
large
impact.
montana
has
about
880
million
people.
there
are
only
1,500
people
involved
in
this
mining.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
what'd
i
say?
i'm
thinking
of
government
expenditures.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that's
right.
so,
there
are
only
1,500
people
involved
in
this
mining.
it's
a
very
low
labor
intensive
operation,
so
they
have
very
few
people
connected
with
mining.
now,
certainly
they
should
pay
their
share
and
even
more
than
their
share.
we'd
be
willing
to
concede
ten
times
their
share
of
libraries
and
hospitals
and
all
the
other
indirect
costs
you
can
think
of.
the
difficulty
montana
has
with
the
case
is
they
can't
think
of
any
reasons.
now,
we'd
like
to
try
it.
we
don't
want
to
try
it
here.
we'd
like
to
have
a
trial
and
i
can
assure
the
court,
if
the
court
says,
in
effect
that
a
state
under
these
circumstances
can
tax
without
limit,
then
it's
just
a
matter
of
time
before
the
other
states
that
have
minerals
would
be
right
in
line.
so
we
believe
that
there
should
be
some
standard,
even
if
it's
a
rough
equivalence,
that
a
state
has
to
use
in
passing
statutes
designed
to
tax
people
outside
of
the
state.
as
to
the
supremacy
clause,
we
have
made,
i
think,
a
substantial
argument
in
the
brief.
i
don't
have
anything
to
add
to
that
at
the
moment.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
there
are
two
arguments,
i
think,
justice
stevens.
one,
although
we
recognize
that
congress
has
a
part
to
play,
we
think
that
the
constitutional
issue
should
be
decided
by
the
court
and
secondly,
if
that
was
the
rule,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
congress
to
anticipate
and
preempt
all
the
schemes
that
the
states
could
dream
up
in
advance.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
i
sure
wouldn't
be
here;
yes.
but
i
can't
imagine
that
congress
is
going
to--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--do
you
think
so?
mr.
william
p.
rogers
oh,
yes:
surely,
surely.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
eliminate
the
constitutional
issues
in
advance,
justice
white,
and
we
don't
think
that's
the
way
to
do
it.
as
i
say,
one
of
the
problems
here
was
that
the
legislature
in
montana
was
advised
that
they
would
have
no
legal
problems,
that
the
courts
would
not
challenge
this
tax,
and
if...
i
am
satisfied
that
if
the
legislature
had
been
advised
that
this
tax
was
going
to
be
subject
to
judicial
scrutiny,
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
the
tax
would
have
been
much
less.
when
montana
imposed
this
tax
was
four
times
as
large
as
any
severance
tax
in
the
nation.
so
this
is
an
excessive,
exorbitant
tax,
and
we
would
like
to
have
a
trial
to
prove
it.
thank
you.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i'll
just
take
a
minute.
i
think
that
this
discussion
has
focused
on
the
issue,
and
that
is
whether
the
complete
auto
test
and
the
washington
stevedoring
test
have
any
meaning.
it's
our
position
that
they
do
have
meaning,
and
that
the
court
intended
that
they
have
meaning.
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
classic
case
because
we've
been
denied
a
trial
and
the
position
of
montana
and
the
solicitor
general
both
is
that
there
is
no
limit
to
the
tax
that
montana
may
impose.
as
the
attorney
general
said
today,
that
they
may
impose,
that
they
would
be
entitled
constitutionally
to
impose
a
tax
of
1,000
percent,
and
in
the
montana
court
it
was
argued
that
the
tax
would
be
without
limit.
so,
this
is
a
situation
where
75
percent
of
this
coal
is
owned
by
the
federal
government.
montana
could
not
impose
a
tax
on
that
coal
without
running
into
the
supremacy
clause,
so
it
has
taxed
30
percent
allegedly
on
the
severance
of
the
coal.
and
i
think
it's
admitted
by...
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
heisler
does
not
apply
here.
the
supreme
court
of
montana
rested
its
case
on
heisler.
so,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
trial.
i
think
the
questions
that
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stevens
asked
were
most
appropriate
because
the
fact
is
that
because
the
tax
revenues
are
so
great
as
a
result
of
this
tax,
that
other
taxes
are
being
reduced,
and
as
the
taxes
continue
to
grow
and
as
this
trust
fund
continues
to
grow,
it
already
has
$200
million,
so
the
interest
on...
i
don't
mean
the
trust
fund
has;
i
mean
the
tax
is
$200
million,
so
the
trust
fund
is
getting
up,
$100
million,
as
as
time
goes
on
it
will
be
in
the
billions,
and
montana
won't
need
any
other
taxes.
this
tax
already
is
amounting
to
almost,
it's
approaching
20
percent
of
the
total
tax
revenues
of
the
state,
so
it's
only
a
matter
of
time
that
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
taxes
in
montana.
and
under
these
circumstances,
if
complete
auto
means
anything...
and
we
think
it
does...
in
washington
stevedoring
case
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
trial,
that
the
appellants
had
not
made
their
claim
of
not-fairly-related.
so
we
think
the
complete
auto
test
requires
a
trial,
and
in
this
case,
when
it
was
so
clearly
tailored
to
fall
on
taxpayers
outside
the
state,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
trial.
if
the
court
should
decide
in
favor
of
montana,
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
a
trial,
that
means
that
under
these
circumstances
in
the
future
any
state
could
tax
without
limit,
and
i
think
the
without-limit
concept
would
have
the
effect
of
balkanizing
this
nation.
there
are
mineral
resources
and
there
are
timber
resources
and
all
kinds
of
resources,
and
if
each
state
may
tax
without
limit,
disregarding
the
needs
of
the
nation
and
that
the
only
remedy
will
be
to
go
to
congress
each
time
and
ask
for
congress
to
preempt
the
tax,
it
will
be
very
difficult.
we
don't
think
that
this
court
would
want
to
create
that
type
of
result.
we
believe
that
after
a
trial
that
montana
will
realize
that
this
tax
is
excessive.
already
the
people
in
montana...
i
notice
some
senators
are
saying
the
tax
is
excessive,
and
i
think
once
this
court
lays
down
some
general
guidelines
for
the
states,
that
the
state
legislatures
will
tend
to
comply
with
those
guidelines.
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
courts,
any
courts,
set
the
tax.
we
say
the
tax
should
be
set
by
the
state
legislatures,
but
they
should
be
fairly
related
to
the
services
and
protection
provided
to
the
taxpayer
by
the
state.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
don't
know
the
answer
specifically
to
uranium
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
there
are
records.
for
example,
montana
and
wyoming
together
have
40
percent
of
the
coal
reserves
of
the
total
country.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
don't
happen
to
know
that,
but
they
are
not
so
many.
there
are
a
few
states
that
control
the
copper.
i
think
they're--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--mostly
western
states;
nevada
and
utah
and
a
few
others
like
that.
but
it
would
be
a
small
number
of
states.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
would
think
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
case
of
sulfur.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
basic
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
is
to
permit
a
free
market
for
goods
in
commerce
so
that
no
state
may
impose
an
undue
burden
on
that
commerce,
and
that
the
federal
government
should
guard
against
states
imposing
undue
burdens
on
that
commerce.
and
we
believe
that
in
this
case
that's
exactly
what
montana
has
done.
thank
you
very
much.
