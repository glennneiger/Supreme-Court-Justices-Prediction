we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
commonwealth
edison
et
al.
v.
montana.
mr.
rogers,
i
think
you
may
now
proceed
whenever
you
wish.

justice

e.

mr.
attorney

chief
justice
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
question
to
you.
suppose
the
legislature
passed
an
act
declared
on
its
face
to
be
a
substitute,
in
terms
of
revenue,
for
all
other
taxes
levied
in
the
state...
state
income
taxes,
state
real
estate
taxes,
sales
taxes,
so
that
the
locals
would
pay
no
taxes
at
all,
and
all
of
it
would,
all
the
cost
of
government
would
be
put
on
one
category
of
taxpayers.
do
you
think
the
courts
could
inquire
into
that?
chief
justice
burger
but
one
tax
on
just
one
category
of
taxpayers.
that's
the
thrust
of--
chief
justice
burger
--well,
the
courts
can
inquire
into
it.
could
there
be
some
judicial
inquiry
into
whether
this
was
a
discriminatory
tax
aimed
at
one
category
of
people?
chief
justice
burger
well,
it
would
be
not
an
abnormal
process
for
legislators
of
a
state,
particularly,
to
say,
let's
put
as
much
as
the
traffic
will
bear
on
the
outsiders
and
relieve
the
local
citizens
of
our
state.
and
my
hypothetical
is
an
extreme
one
but
they
are
relieved
of
all
taxes
because
of
the
windfall
they
would
get
out
of
taxing
one
particular
industry
or
one
particular
category
of
taxpayers.
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
in
that
respect
it's
different
from
the
case
that
was
argued
previously,
where
there's
a
difference
in
the
tax
on
the
material
taken
out
of
the
state?
chief
justice
burger
--suppose...
hypothetically,
again...
it
could
be
shown
that
the
entire
cost
of
the
services
which
the
state
gave
to
five
taxpayers
engaged
in
extracting
natural
resources
was
$500,000
and
that
the
taxes
imposed
on
them
were
$100
million.
do
you
think
there
could
be
some
judicial
curiosity
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
about--
chief
justice
burger
--then
add
to
my
hypothetical
what
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
that
all
other
taxes
on
all
other
residents
of
montana
were
repealed
and
montanans
paid
no
tax
and
all
the
tax
was
thrust
upon
five
companies
or
six
companies
engaged
in
extracting
coal
and
oil.
any
judicial
inquiry
then,
on
any
clause?
not
just
the
commerce
clause.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
your
time
has
not
expired,
mr.
attorney
general,
but
this
is
your...
mr.
rogers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
