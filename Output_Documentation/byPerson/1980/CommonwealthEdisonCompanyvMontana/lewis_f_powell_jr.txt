mr.
rogers,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
conclude?
you
haven't
had
a
chance
to
introduce
evidence
but
are
there
public
records
that
would
show
which
states
have
the
minerals
that
are
essential
to
the
operation
of
our
country?
for
example,
how
many
states
have
uranium?
justice
jr.
how
many
states
control
the
copper
of
the
united
states?

about

is
the
basic
purpose
