mr.
rogers,
i
agree
with
what
i
think
you're
arguing.
i
mean,
i
thoroughly
agree
with
you,
but
i
don't
know
how
i
can
sustain
it,
and
that
is
that
i
can
decide
what
the
tax
is
going
to
be
on
me.
i
mean,
i'm
for
that,
but
i
can't
sustain
it,
and
is
that
not
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
marshall
you
want
a
hearing
which
will
determine
how
much
your
tax
is
to
be?
justice
marshall
assuming
that's
true--
justice
marshall
--will
the
court
be
asked
to
fix
a
rate?
justice
marshall
well,
will
the
court
be
asked
to
fix
a
line?
justice
marshall
i'd
love
to
have
the
right
to
fix
my
own
rate
of
taxes.
justice
marshall
mine
would
be
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
minus
two.
