justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rogers,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
state
of
montana
could
not
have
doubled
its
severance
tax
at
any
particular
time?
justice
rehnquist
but
then
isn't
that
going
to
make
it
a
case-by-case
adjudication
in
every
situation
where
the
federal
courts
decide
whether
a
tax
is
or
is
not?
justice
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
the
same
have
been
true
20
or
30
or
40
years
ago
in
oklahoma
or
texas
with
respect
to
a
severance
tax
on
oil?
justice
rehnquist
does
a
state
have
to
make
a
claim
that
it
needs
the
money
in
order
to
exercise
the
taxing
power?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
question
is,
what
standards
can
we
establish?
justice
rehnquist
there
are
people
in
montana
who
are
paying
taxes.
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
language
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
about
its
fear
of
the
consequences
of
strip
mining
and
of
the
process
of
restoration?
justice
rehnquist
you
can
say
that
under
the
commerce
clause
that
the
tax
may
well
be
invalid,
but
to
say
there's
no
"justification"
for
the
tax
strikes
me
as
a
misapplication
of
constitutional
principles,
to
say
they
have
to
justify
a
tax.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
greely,
does
montana
follow
the
procedures
of
most
federal
civil
rules
for
the
states,
all
well-pleaded
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
deemed
true
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
would
have
to
concede
that
all
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
well-pleaded
are
true
since
the--
justice
rehnquist
--facts;
facts.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
greely,
couldn't
a
state
decide
in
connection
with
purely
local
activity
not
to
actually
forbid
it,
but
that
it
simply
didn't
like
the
activity
and
taxed
it,
say,
at
a
rate
of
75
percent?
