justice
jr.
well,
now,
suppose
we
found
we
couldn't
and
decided
that
we
couldn't
fill
in
the
gap
to
find
any
implicit
right
of
contribution.
would
you
suggest
then
we
should
fashion
one?
justice
jr.
are
there
many
cases
where
courts
have
fashioned
one
as
a
judicial
remedy?
justice
jr.
how
many
state
cases?
seems
to
me
i
remember
one
that
goes
back
to
when
i
was
a
state
judge.
justice
jr.
where
we
said
it
had
to
be
done
by
the
legislature.
we
couldn't
do
it.
justice
jr.
we
had
a
statute?
justice
jr.
well,
you
mean
without
congress
saying
we
should?
justice
jr.
right.
you
wouldn't
have
us
fashion
it
for
any
purpose?
justice
jr.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
slater
that
there
have
been,
at
least
some
states,
that
judicially
have
fashioned
a
right
of
contribution?
justice
jr.
you
say,
a
couple,
not?
justice
jr.
in
antitrust
cases?
justice
jr.
that
is,
at
least,
as
a
matter
of...
something
fashioned
as
a
judicial
remedy?
justice
jr.
as
opposed
to
a
legislative?
