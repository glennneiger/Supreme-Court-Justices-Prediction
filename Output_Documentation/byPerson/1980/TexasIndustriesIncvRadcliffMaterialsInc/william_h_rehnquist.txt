justice
rehnquist
you
don't
contend,
do
you,
that
if
the
plaintiff
had
sued
four
and
obtained
a
judgment
against
four,
he
could
have
levied
on
one
for
the
entire
amount?
justice
rehnquist
you
agree
that
he
could
have
done
that?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
contribution
remedy
would
have
to
be
worked
out
afterwards?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there
were
a
contribution
remedy,
would
you
say
that
that
prevented
the
plaintiff
from
levying
on
one
of
the
four?
justice
rehnquist
for
the
full
amount?
justice
rehnquist
--you
do
agree
that
the
rule
against
contribution
among
joint
tortfeasors
is
fairly
well
established
in
tort
law,
do
you
not?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
a
recognized
doctrine
in
some
states
in
tort
law,
isn't
it?
the
doctrine
of
indemnification
where
a
passive
tortfeasor
can
implead
an
active
tortfeasor,
even
though
the
plaintiff
can
go
against
the
passive
tortfeasors?
justice
rehnquist
but
each
is
importing
into
the
antitrust
laws
a
doctrine
that
has
been
either
been
rejected
or
accepted
in
the
orthodox
law
of
torts,
whether
it's
comparative
negligence,
indemnity,
or
contribution.
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
1946
amendment
to
rule
14
was
deliberately
designed
to
prohibit
a
defendant
from
forcing
a
plaintiff
to
sue
another
defendant,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
that
was
based
on
the
dictionary
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
that
was
based
on
the
dictionary
act,
wasn't
it,
that
a
foreign
corporation
was
a
person?
justice
rehnquist
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
in
section
15
u.s.c.
15,
which
is
the
part
of
the
clayton
act
that
gives
private
claimants
the
right,
it
says
that
"the
plaintiff
shall
have
the
right
to
recover
damages
by
him
sustained
in
the
cost
of
suit,
including
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
"
doesn't
that
in
effect
fix
the
remedy
of
a
private
plaintiff,
and
pretty
well
make
it
a
traditional
common
law
damages
action?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
goes
at
least
one
step.
justice
rehnquist
certainly,
no
plaintiff
would
have
any
incentive?
well
it
might
save
him
a
lot
of...
if
he
thought
that
each
one
should
pay
a
third
and
would
like
to
collect
from
them
a
third
because
they've
all
kicked
him
around
a
little,
it
would
certainly
save
him
a
lot
of
inconvenience
of
they
were
ordered
to
pay
a
third.
he
might
think
that
would
enhance
his
future
business
relations
with
one
of
them.
justice
rehnquist
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
it
kind
of
puts
a
wild
card
in
the
game?
justice
rehnquist
yet,
didn't
the
1946
amendment
to
rule
14
permit
the
plaintiff
in
any
civil
case
brought
in
the
united
states
district
courts
to
choose
his
defendant
out
of
whim,
spite,
any
other
reason?
