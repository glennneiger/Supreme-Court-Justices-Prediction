justice
white
well,
what
about
the
nonstatutory
cases
in
tort
law?
isn't
the
restatement
ruled
a
contribution?
or
is
it?
justice
white
would
you
say
that
if
a
judgment
is
entered
against
three
conspirators
for
treble
damages,
that
after
a
successful
prosecution
of
an
antitrust
case
the
judge
enters
the
judgment.
may
he
order
each
defendant
to
pay
a
third
if
the
plaintiff
requests
him
to?
justice
white
that
wasn't
my
question,
was
it?
justice
white
that
still
isn't
my
question.
could
a
judge
order
then
to
do
that
at
the
request
of
the
plaintiff?
justice
white
well,
under
state
antitrust
laws?
justice
white
what,
what,
contribution,
the
minority
rule?
justice
white
but
then,
contrary
to
the
common
law,
the
regular
rule
in
the
nonintentional
torts
is
contribution?
justice
white
although
the
common
law
was
opposed?
justice
white
how
much
chance
do
you
think
congress
would
have
of
coming
up
with
a
contribution
bill?
justice
white
i
know
what
it
is.
justice
white
i've
read
it
in
the
last
five
minutes.
