mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
matter
this
morning
is
whether
a
defendant
in
a
federal
antitrust
action
may
seek
contributions,
and
the
threshold
question
we
submit
to
the
court
is
whether
the
remedy
sought
here
is
one
that
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
congressional
intent
of
the
antitrust
laws?
will
it
further
the
congressional
goals
to
grant
contributions?
in
order
to
address
the
question,
we
would
briefly
like
to
just
review
the
very
brief
facts
of
this
case.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
situation
in
which
a
plaintiff
has
filed
a
treble
damage
action
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
alleging
a
pricefixing
conspiracy.
the
plaintiff
has
sued
texas
industries.
identified
as
alleged
coconspirators
with
texas
industries
were
the
three
respondents.
the
plaintiff
did
not
sue
the
three
respondents,
he
selected
texas
industries
as
the
target
and
texas
industries
in
turn
filed
a
third
party
demand
seeking
contribution.
now,
although,
in
order
for
liability
to
exist
to
the
plaintiff
here,
there
must
have
been
some
participation
by
one
or
more
of
these
respondents
along
with
texas
industries,
the
plaintiff
can
do
what
he
has
done
here.
he
can
select
and
he
can
elect,
as
he
has
done,
to
sue
a
single
tortfeasor.
under
the
existing
case
law
all
coconspirators
are
joint
tortfeasors
and
have
been
so
for
many,
many
years.
each,
as
a
joint
tortfeasor,
is
liable
for
the
whole
of
the
damages
that
the
plaintiff
can
prove.
and
in
addition,
even
if
the
plaintiff
here
had
elected
to
sue
all
four
and
had
obtained
a
judgment
against
all
four,
he
could
then
elect
to
levy
his
judgment
on
any
one
of
the
four
and
collect
from
that
one.
in
the
absence
of
contribution,
txi,
texas
industries,
cannot
force
any
of
these
respondents
to
share
the
common
burden,
and
had
the
plaintiff
sued
all
four
and
obtained
a
judgment
and
decided
to
levy
on
one,
that
one
in
the
absence
of
contribution
could
not
force
the
other
judgment
debtors
to
pay
any
share
of
their
judgment.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes,
sir,
he
could
have
done
that.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
in
the
absence
of
contribution
there
would
be
no
way
that
that
one
who
is
levied
on
could
force
the
other
three
to
pay
part
of
the
deficit.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
no,
sir;
it
would
not
prevent
him.
contribution
does
not
affect
the
plaintiff's
right
to
go
against
any
one
of
the
joint
tortfeasors.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
for
the
full
amount.
the
only
thing
that
contribution
would
do
would
be
to
permit
the
one
who
is
levied
upon
to
get
a
share
of
that
back
from
the
others.
it
would
not
affect
the
plaintiff.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
your
honor,
i
view
contribution
as
a
remedy
that
will
further
the
goals
sought
by
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
think
it
is
a
remedy
that
should
be
recognized
as
such,
and
that
even
though
it
might
arise
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
such
as
a
settlement,
for
example,
that
can
be
handled.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
that's
right.
we
don't
have
a
settlement
here.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
but
our
position,
i
think,
we've
said
in
the
brief,
even
though
we
are
not
involved
in
a
settlement
situation,
that
we
would
never
suggest
that
a
settling
defendant
should
be
brought
back
into
the
case.
we
think
that
once
a
person
has
settled
he
should
be
out.
and
that
the--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--certainly.
and
that
the
plaintiff's
claiming
should
be
reduced
in
some
way,
some
way
that
can
be
fashioned
by
the
court.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes.
that's
right.
and
there
are
several
ways
that
that
can
be
done,
depending
upon
how
the
court--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
it's
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
actual
payment.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
are
whether,
for
example,
if
a
pro
rata
approach
was
taken
to
contributions,
such
as
was
done
in
the
professional
beauty
supply
case,
it
may
well
be
that
the
way
to
handle
settlements
is
to
count
the
number
of
conspirators,
and
if
a
plaintiff
settles
with
one
of
the
ten,
let's
say,
then
his
claim
is
reduced
by
ten
percent.
that's
a
simple--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--well,
that
would
have
to
be
the
case
in
that
situation.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
that's
right;
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
right.
but
that
would
not
impair
the
settlement
process
in
any
way,
because--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--that's
right;
that's
immaterial.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
i
think
it
was
purely
fortuitous,
your
honor.
in
this
situation
the
concrete
market,
the
customers
that
are
involved
in
concrete,
the
purchasers
of
concrete,
will
buy
from
the
suppliers
that
are
closest
to
them,
and
even
though
in
this
case
there
were
no
purchases
made
by
the
plaintiff
from
the
respondents,
as
we
point
out
in
the
reply
brief
there,
they
were--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--well,
i
would
not
think
that
would
be
a
settlement;
no,
sir.
but
certainly--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--what
you
raise
there
could
happen.
and
it
could
happen,
for
example,
in
the
example
that
i
made
to
the
court,
had
we
all
been
sued
and
four
of
us
been
sued,
and
this
plaintiff
wanted
to
do
business
with
the
three
respondents
and
decided
to
forego
any
business
relations
with
texas
industries,
he'd
simply
levy
against
texas
industries
and
that
would
be
as
far
as
they
could
go.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
but
his
claim
would
be
reduced,
though,
under
my
theory.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
no,
sir.
what
i
would
suggest
in
that
case
would
be
that,
and
as
justice
stewart
points
out,
we're
getting
into
some
areas
where
there
are
a
lot
of
answers
and
a
lot
of
questions;
but
the
pro
rata
approach,
as
taken
by
the
court
would
be...
in
our
situation,
for
example,
had
the
plaintiff
settled
with
three
of
the
four,
then
his
claim
would
have
been
reduced
by
75
percent.
now,
before
he
settled
with
the
three
of
those
four,
he
would
give
some
serious
thought,
if
he
knew
that,
and
assuming
he
knew
the
law.
then,
before
he
would
settle
for
$1,000,
he
would
think
very
hard,
because
he
would
be
giving
up
a
substantial
part
of
his
claim.
on
the
other
hand,
be
would
know
what
he
was
giving
up.
if
it
turned
out
that
there
were
more
coconspirators
than
four,
then
the
amount
he's
given
up
would
simply
be--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--no,
sir,
we
would
not
count
them.
if
there
was
a
company
and
an
employee,
i
think
that
should
be
handled
as
one.
you
would
not
distinguish
and
cause
that
to
be
two.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
he
could
increase
the
ad
damnum,
your
honor,
but
the
question,
i
think,
would
arise
as
to
what
the
judgment
was
when
he
finally
got
it.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
no,
you
don't,
but
you
should
have
some
idea
in
most
of
these
cases
of
generally
what
damages
are
going
in.
and
certainly
sometimes
they'll
claim
that
there's
been
an
overcharge
in
a
pricefixing
case
of
$10
a
yard,
when
in
fact
it's
gone
up
$2.
but
the
parties
who
were
actually
involved
in
that
sort
of
thing
should
have
some
idea
as
to
what
the
evidence
will
show,
and
be
able
to
handle
what
they
feel
are
the
damages.
if
your
honors
please,
the
ultimate
effect
of
a
no
contribution
rule
is
that
the
conspirators
whose
joint
illegal
activities
create
the
liability
may
escape
that
liability
and
go
scot
free
at
the
whim
of
a
plaintiff.
that
really
is
the
end
line
of
a
rule
against
contribution.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
your
honor,
the
rule
in
favor
of
contribution
has
been
evolving
consistently
through
the
courts
in
the
last
several
years
in
the...
there's
a
case
that
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
the
kohr
case,
which
involved
a
mid-air
collision.
i
think
it's
around
1970
or
thereabouts.
the
doctrine
has
evolved
in
the
civil
rights
area
in
the
glus
case,
just
very
recently.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
gets
into
the
question
of,
i
think,
of
fairness.
what
is
fair?
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
probably
is
true,
although
i've
read
perma
life
a
number
of
times,
and
i
must
confess
i
really
don't
thoroughly
understand
the
decision.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
that
you
have
to
consider
the
question
of
fairness,
whether
it's
among
joint
wrongdoers
or
whether
it's
among
nonwrongdoers.
and
it's
a
question
of
what
is
fair
and
that's...
the
evolution
of
this
doctrine
of
permitting
contribution
has
evolved
along
that
line.
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
cooper
stevedoring
case,
the
admiralty
case,
i
think
talks
in
terms
of--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
it
is
sort
of
different
than
the
ordinary
situation.
but
you
have
the...
we
have
the
glus
case
in
the
civil
rights
area;
it's
a
1980
case.
and
in
the
securities
area
we've
had
the
recent
heizer
corporation
case,
and
before
that
there
were
several
cases.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
some
of
them
do;
yes,
sir.
the
10(b)(5)
cases,
there
the
court
implied
a
right
of
action,
cause
of
action.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
that's
correct,
under
10(b)(5).
but
you're
correct
that
there
is,
in
the
statute,
there
are
some
references
to
contribution.
if
your
honors
please,
in
order
to
determine
whether
contribution
is
a
remedy
which
will
achieve
congressional
intent,
we
think
it's
appropriate
in
the
first
place
to
actually
first
analyze
the
statutes,
take
a
look
at
section
1
of
the
sherman
and
at
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
and
an
analysis
of
these
statutes
clearly
showed
that
they
are
penal,
they
are
punitive
statutes,
that
they're
designed
to
provide
both
civil
and
criminal
punishment
for
violators
of
the
antitrust
laws.
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
establishes
a
violation,
it
defines
illegal
activities,
and
it
provides
that
every
contract
combination
of
conspiracy
that
unreasonably
restrains
trade
is
illegal,
and
that
every
person,
who
engages
in
those
illegal
activities
is
guilty.
and
it
then
provides
for
criminal
penalties.
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
provides
that
any
person
who
is
injured
in
his
business
or
his
property
by
reason
of
anything
forbidden
in
the
antitrust
laws
may
recover
treble
damages.
now,
when
these
statutes
are
read
together,
it
becomes
pretty
clear
that
what
constitutes
the
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
penalties
therefore,
and
that
there
are
really
established
two
groups,
those
that
can
recover
treble
damages
and
those
that
are
liable
for
those
damages.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
does.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
possible
ways
of
apportioning
the
liability
among
joint
tortfeasors.
now,
certainly
that
has
been
done
in
some
areas
where
contribution
is
permitted.
you
have
a
comparative
fault
concept,
or
a
relative
culpability
concept,
which
i
think
is
what
your
honor
is
referring
to,
where
you
in
effect
say,
one
is
more
guilty...
put
it
that
way...
than
the
others.
the
difficulties
with
that
approach
is
that
at
the
present
time
all
cotortfeasors
are
equally
liable
and
if
you
approach
it
on
the
basis
of
an
apportionment
of
fault,
then
you
will
be
calling
on
the
courts
at
that
point
to
in
effect
referee
degrees
of
fault
as
among
wrongdoers
and
you
are
calling
on
each
of
the
tortfeasors
to
attempt
to
show
that
he
is
not
quite
as
wrong
as
the
other
fellow.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
that's
true,
and
it's
also
true
that
there
are
some
jurisdictions
in
which
they
actually
apportion
fault,
based
on
whether
you
felt
there's
really
a
comparative
fault
in
order
to
achieve
contributions.
i
think
the
indemnity
situation
is
different,
because
there
you're
calling
on
someone
to
indemnify
you
for
100
percent,
for
whatever
you're
suing.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes.
if
your
honors
please,
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
that
all
persons
who
violated
the
antitrust
laws
would
be
punished,
would
be
penalized,
would
be
subjected
to
civil
liability.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes,
sir;
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
that
is
precisely
why
we
need
contribution,
because
in
order
to
make
certain--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
that
could
be
done.
but
when
a
plaintiff
elects
not
to
do
that,
there
is
at
present
no
way
that
a
civil
defendant
who
is
sued
can
demand
contribution
from
his
alleged
cotortfeasors.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
you
in
effect
bring
in
a
defendant
and
say,
defendant,
you're
in
the
case,
as
you
do
in
admiralty,
you're
in
here
for
all
purposes.
what
we're
saying
is
that
under
rule
14
you
can
third-party
your
cotortfeasors
and
bring
them
in
and
say,
you
are
liable
to
me,
and
i
am
liable...
if
i
am
liable
to
the
plaintiff.
in
order
to
achieve
what
we
perceive
to
be
this
congressional
intent
as
expressed
in
the
statutes
themselves,
we
believe
that
it
is
essential
that
contribution
be
permitted
among
joint
tortfeasors.
without
contribution
there
is
no
mechanism
whatever
by
which
the
liability
of
all
civil
violators
can
be
assured,
where
the
plaintiff
can
elect
to
sue
one
or
more
coconspirators
or
levy
against
one
or
more
coconspirator
judgment
debtors.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
courts
have
recognized
that
one
of
the
major
goals,
or
one
of
the
major
purposes
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws
was
to
penalize
wrongdoers,
to
deprive
violators
of
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
fruits
of
their
illegal
acts.
and
this
court,
in
the
brunswick
case
in
1977,
stated
that
treble
damages
play
an
important
role
in
penalizing
wrongdoers.
in
the
pfizer
case,
in
1978--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--your
honor,
i've
read
that
formula,
and--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--well,
what's
wrong
with
it
is
that
without...
we
cannot
be
liable
to
this
plaintiff
without
joint
activity
on
behalf
of
one
or
more
of
these
respondents,
so
their
activities
caused
whatever
damages
this
plaintiff
has
sustained,
just
as
much
as
we
have.
now--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir,
under
the
existing
case
law
he
could
sue
them
and
if
they
had
not
sold
him
a
single
thing--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--he
could
collect
100
percent
of
his
judgment
from
these
people.
now,
what
in
effect
they're
saying
is
that
we
didn't
sell,
therefore
we
have
a
defense.
that's
not
the
case;
there's
no
defense.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
whether
you've
sold
or
haven't
sold
is
really
immaterial.
and
i
think
we've
cited
some
cases
in
the
brief--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
it's
purely
fortuitous
and
i
think
we've
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief
that
this
is
not
the
only
litigation
arising
out
of
this
conspiracy.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
the
formula?
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
true
if
you
had
a
particular...
there's
a
certain
number
that
you
reach
that
works
that
way,
and
then
after
you
pass
that,
then
you're
outside
that
formula.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
it's
an
interesting
formula
but
i
think
it
has
any
real--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
believe
me,
our
client
has
ben
deterred.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
no,
sir,
that's
correct.
and
the
thing
is...
you're
absolutely
right.
it's
a
purely
fortuitous
situation
in
this
case,
based
upon
the
way
the
concrete
industry
operates.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it's
in
the
statutes,
themselves.
we
firmly
believe
that
the--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--that's
correct,
it's
not.
the
statute
don't
say
that
you
should
have
contribution,
and
they
don't
say
that
you
don't
have
contributions.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
this--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--first
of
all,
we
believe
you
certainly
have
the
power
to
interpret
the
antitrust
laws.
this
court
certainly
has
that
power.
and
in
fact
it
is
a
function
of
the
court
to
interpret
those
statutes
in
such
a
way
as
to
carry
out
congressional
intent.
we
believe
that
the
statutes,
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
not
comprehensive
statutes,...
in
fact,
they're
quite
skeletal...
and
that
this
court
can
fill
in
the
gaps.
and
i
believe,
in
fact--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
the--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the
cases
that
we
cite
in
the
brief,
the
kohr
case;
it
was
a
negligence
case.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
there
was
one...
yes,
sir,
you
wrote
an
opinion
when
you
were
the
chief
justice
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
no,
i
think
you
did
grant
it,
as
i
recall.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
louisiana
has
a
statute,
for
example.
there
are
many
states
that
have
statutes,
but
with
respect
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
we
believe
that
when
the
congressional
goals
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
clear,
that
every
person
in
a
joint
action
who
violates
the
antitrust
laws
shall
be
liable;
that
this
court
has
the
power
and
the
authority
to
fashion
a
remedy,
if
that's
what
your
honor
wishes
to
call
it,
to
accomplish
that
objective.
and
certainly
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
have
emanated
from
the
court
where
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
comprehensive
in
nature.
the
national
society
of
professional
engineers
is
a
recent
case
that
we
have
cited
in
the
brief.
now,
in
pfizer
v.
government
of
india...
it
was
a
1978
case...
this
court
recognized
the
right
of
a
foreign
plaintiff
to
sue
for
treble
damages
on
the
theory
that
to
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
the
right
to
sue
would
permit
price
fixers
or
monopolists
to
escape
liabilities.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
sir?
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
but
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
stressed
was
that,
if
this
were
not
the
case
and
you
had
not
recognized
that
they
had
the
right
to
sue,
that
it
would
have
permitted
the
price
fixers
or
monopolists
to
escape
liability.
the
same
sort
of
doctrine
was
recognized
years
ago
in
hanover
shoe,
which
we
think
stands
for
the
proposition
that
one
of
the
major
congressional
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
to
punish
violators.
those
who
are
liable
should
have
to
pay,
and
without
contribution
that
goal
is
defeated.
i've
mentioned
to
your
honors
the
evolution
of
the
doctrine
of
contribution
through
the
federal
common
law
in
the
various
areas,
and
we
submit,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
rule
denying
contribution
will
defeat
congressional
intent
and
that
it
is
inequitable,
it
is
archaic,
and
it's
unfair.
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
unless
there's
some
questions.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
certainly,
that
particular
statute
sets
out
a
private
cause
of
action
in
behalf
of
persons
who
were
injured
in
their
business
for
profit,
and
provides
for
treble
damages.
there's
no
question
about
that.
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
cort
v.
ash
cases
and
the
cases
along
that
line.
they
quote
piper
v.
chris-craft
and
those
cases.
but
we
believe
that
contribution
goes
a
step
further.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
yes.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
if
your
honors
please,
insofar
as
the
question
of
the
fairness
argument
is
concerned,
i
think
perhaps
the
statement
of
the
8th
circuit
in
professional
beauty
supply
puts
the
question
a
great
deal
more
accurately
than
i've
been
able
to
do.
in
that
case,
that
court,
considering
an
antitrust
contribution
concept,
said,
"we
believe
that
the
question
of
deterrence
actually
cuts
both
ways,
and
on
balance
a
rule
allowing
contribution
is
actually
a
greater
deterrent.
"
"the
fact
that
one
tortfeasor
may
be
held
liable
for
the
damages
arising
from
the
antitrust
violation
necessarily
means
others
may
go
scot
free.
"
"the
possibility
of
escaping
all
liability
might
cause
many
to
be
more
willing
rather
than
less
willing
to
engage
in
wrongful
activity.
"
and
it
went
on
to
say,
"the
deciding
factor
in
our
decision
is
fairness
between
the
parties.
"
"we
conclude
that
fairness
requires
a
right
of
contribution
exist
among
joint
tortfeasors,
at
least
under
certain
circumstances.
"
"there
is
an
obvious
lack
of
sense
in
justice
in
a
rule
which
permits
the
entire
burden
of
restitution
of
a
loss
for
which
two
parties
are
responsible
to
be
placed
upon
one
alone
because
of
the
plaintiff's
whim
or
spite,
or
his
collusion
with
the
other
wrongdoer.
"
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
no
way
that
texas
industries
can
be
liable
to
this
plaintiff
without
the
joint
responsibility
of
these
respondents.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
he
could
choose
his
defendant;
certainly
in
an
antitrust
case
he
can
choose
his
defendant,
aside
from
the
federal
rules,
because
of
the
case
law.
he
can
pick
and
choose.
he
could
have
sued
one
of
these
respondents.
he
could
have
collected
from
one
of
these
respondents
and
never
sued
texas
industries,
even
though
he
bought
it
from
texas
industries.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
perhaps
that's
true,
your
honor.
in
most
instances,
i
think,
you
find
that
the
plaintiff
wants
to
sue
all
those
that
he
knows
as
coconspirators.
but
he
could
have
any
number
of
reasons
why
he
doesn't
want
to.
he
could
be
doing
business
with
him,
for
example.
i
think
that
was
the
olson
farms--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--well,
perhaps,
but
at
the
same
time--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
wrong
because
i
think
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
so
that
those
who
are
guilty
shall
pay,
those
that
are
liable
shall
pay.
they
are
all
joint
tortfeasors,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--that's
certainly
true
in
criminal
matters;
certainly
true.
can't
argue
with
that.
i
don't
know
that
that's
necessarily
fair,
but
it
certainly
is
the
case
in
criminal
matters.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
with
respect
to
a
civil
situation
where
you
have
a
specific
cause
of
action
conferred
on
a
particular
group
of
persons
who
were
injured
against
another
group
who
caused
that
injury,
then
the
plaintiff
should
certainly
be
permitted
to
pick
and
choose
whom
he
wants
to
sue.
we
don't
want
to
complicate
his
suit
in
any
way.
he
can
pick
and
choose,
he
can
sue
one,
he
can
sue
two,
he
can
sue
them
all.
but
as
between
those
persons
who
are
liable,
they
should
be
able
to
spread
the
burden.
that
really
is
the
crux
of
the--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--that's
right.
their
defense
is,
if
they're
not,
if
they
did
not
conspire,
then
of
course,
there's
no
liability.
insofar
as
the
deterrence
goes,
i
won't
harp
on
that,
but
it
occurs
to
us
that,
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
the
question
of
deterrence
can
cut
both
ways.
certainly
the
argument
can
be
made
that
to
cause
a
company
to
be
exposed
to
the
possibility
of
bearing
the
entire
risk,
entire
judgment,
would
be
more
of
a
deterring
factor
than
it
would
be
for
them
to
know
that
they
could
spread
the
risk.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
much
better
chance
of
their
knowing
that
they're
going
to
get
sued
if
there
is
contribution.
because
if
then,
if
one
or
two
or
three
or
four
of
the
group
of
coconspirators
are
sued,
you
can
rest
assured
they
are
going
to
make
certain
that
the
other
coconspirators
are
brought
into
that
case.
so
it's
a
question
of
which
is
the
greatest
deterrent?
is
it
the
exposure
to
the
larger
dollars,
or
is
it
the
greater
possibility
of
being
exposed
to
a
judgment?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
occurs
to
us
that
the
real
deterrent
in
antitrust
matters
is
the
criminal
statute,
and
that
the
possibility
of
fines
and
the
possibility
of
jail
terms
to
those
persons
who
are
thinking
of
violating
the
law
is
really
the
deterring
factor.
and
if
they're
not
concerned
about
jail
terms
and
they're
not
concerned
about
felony
convictions
and
jail
terms
and
hundred-thousand-dollar
fines,
they're
not
going
to
be
concerned
about
whether
or
not
their
employer
has
to
pay
a
whole
judgement
or
a
cost.
insofar
as
the
complexity
question
is
concerned,
we
certainly...
certainly,
anytime
you
add
parties,
anytime
that
you
permit
additional
causes
of
action,
you
of
course
increase
the
complexity
somewhat.
but
the
securities
cases
are
complex
cases,
and
they've
been
handled
by
the
courts
and
the
courts
can
sever,
they
can
sever
the
claims,
they
can
order
new
trials,
separate
trials.
there
are
any
number
of
procedural
devices
available
to
the
courts
to
permit
them
to
handle
whatever
complexity
might
arise.
it
won't
complicate
the
plaintiff's
suit
in
any
way.
the
only
complexity
that
can
arise
would
be
the
increased
complexity
that
might
be
caused
as
a
result
of
cross-claims
and
third
party
demands,
and
we
submit,
your
honors,
that--
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
--sir?
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
i
suppose
there
could
be
that,
if
that
situation...
if
you
got
into
it,
you
might
be
more
inclined
to.
mr.
benjamin
r.
slater,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
so
because,
really,
what
happens
in
these
cases,
though,
they're
long,
they're
drawn
out,
there
is
long,
protracted
litigation.
they're
very
expensive
litigation
to
carry
on,
and
i
think
that
most
defendants
find
themselves
in
a
posture
of
wanting
to
settle
initially
if
they
can,
in
some
way,
as
soon
as
it
becomes
apparent
that
they're
going
to
have
some
exposure.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
contribution
really
is
going
to
have
an
adverse
effect,
if
you
were
to
grant
it,
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
settlements
at
all.
