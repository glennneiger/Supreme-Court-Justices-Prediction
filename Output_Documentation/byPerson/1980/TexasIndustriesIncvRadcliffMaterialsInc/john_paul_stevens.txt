justice
stevens
mr.
slater,
do
we
know
why
the
plaintiff
did
not
sue
the
respondents?
justice
stevens
what
i
was
going
to
suggest
is
that
the
distinction
between
a
settlement
and
a
prelitigation
decision
not
to
sue
somebody
may
be
a
fairly
fine
line.
you
might
want
to
do
business...
say,
in
the
olson
brothers
case,
where
you
may
want
to
do
business
with
somebody
and
said,
we
won't
sue
you
if
you
give
us
a
good
price
for
the
next
three
years.
would
that
be
a
settlement?
and
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
right
of
contribution
there.
justice
stevens
how
do
you
draw
the
distinction
between--
justice
stevens
--or
he
might
settle
with
each
of
them
for
$1,000
apiece,
so
if
i
understand
your
view,
then
you'd
lose
your
right
of
contribution
that
you
claim
you
have.
justice
stevens
but
his
claim
wouldn't
be
reduced
by
anything
here
because
he
didn't
buy
anything
from
you.
justice
stevens
do
the
individual
defendants
count
as
coconspirators
for
the
purpose
of
your
rule?
justice
stevens
mr.
slater,
if
we
can
believe
the
arithmetic
of
your
opponents,
your
rule
will
leave
you
with
a
net
profit,
won't
it?
justice
stevens
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
stevens
--how
persuasive
your
deterrence
argument
is
in
this
particular
case?
justice
stevens
i
was
just
considering
the
effect
of
deterrence
argument
in
this
particular
case.
it
doesn't
like
the
rule
would
provide
maximum
deterrence
to
your
client.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
cellini,
that
really
is
an
argument
against
the
per
capita
rules,
not
necessarily
valid
in
all
possible
applications
of
contribution.
what
would
you
say
about
the
olson
farm
situation?
that's
one
that
does
strike
one
as
somewhat
unfair.
justice
stevens
of
course,
some
of
the
amici
argue
that
some
of
these
settlements
are
themselves
somewhat
unfair
because
the
price
constantly
rises
as
the
settlement
progresses.
justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
insofar
as
you
stress
the
importance
of
not
complicating
the
plaintiff's
right
to
recover
by
burdening
the
litigation
with
a
lot
of
parties
and
so
forth,
could
not
that
problem
be
solved
by
requiring
the
claim
for
contribution
to
be
asserted
after
judgment?
justice
stevens
you'd
add
to
the
burden
of
the
courts,
of
course,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
would
add
to
the
plaintiff's
burden,
is
what
i
was--
justice
stevens
isn't
there
this
factor
too,
mr.
slater,
that
i
suppose
you're
more
apt
to
settle
if
we
affirm?
justice
stevens
aren't
you
more
apt
to
settle
the
case
if
we
affirm
than
if
we
reverse,
if
you're
the
only
one
on
the
line
and
you
know
you
can't
recover
from
someone
else
after
a
judgment?
it
seems
to
me
you
have
motivation
to
settle
right
now.
justice
stevens
wouldn't
that
be
a
general
characteristic
of
these
proceedings,
that
if
you
have
a
possible
recovery
over
against
nonparties,
you'd
have
an
additional
reason
for
not
settling
in
every
case?
