we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
texas
industries
v.
radcliff
materials.
mr.
slater,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
this
trend
you
speak
of,
mr.
slater,
to
whatever
extent
there
is
a
trend,
that
cuts
against
the
ancient
equity
doctrine
in
pari
delicto
the
condition
of
the
defendant
is
the
better,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
the
old
equity.
whether
it's
relevant
here
or
not.
perhaps
relief
would
fall
short,
but
if
they're
in
equal
fault,
the
courts,
the
law
leaves
them
where
it
found
them,
that's
the
general
thrust,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
admiralty
is
a
very,
very
special
sort
of
set
of
rules,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
but
then
to
pursue
that
in
pari
delicto
concept,
the
statute
treats
them
all
in
equal
fault
as
with
a
felony
murder
case,
for
example,
does.
chief
justice
burger
so
should
any
court
undertake
to
make
some
different
evaluations,
saying
one
of
them
is
more
or
less
at
fault
than
the
other?
chief
justice
burger
well,
one
way
to
guarantee
that
would
be
to
make
them
all
defendants,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
it
would
not
guarantee
it,
necessarily,
but
that
would
be
the
opening--
chief
justice
burger
--what
i
meant
was,
suing
them
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
burger
tell
me
again,
mr.
slater,
where
is
the
source
of
authority
for
the
courts
to
devise
the
remedial
concept
that
you're
urging?
chief
justice
burger
it
has
to
be
implicit,
because
it's
not
there
explicitly.
chief
justice
burger
well,
isn't
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
ordinarily,
since
it
involves
policy,
that's
usually
left
to
congress?
the
federal
courts
don't
have
the
same...
common
law
powers--
chief
justice
burger
--that
state
courts
do,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cellini.
chief
justice
burger
are
those
part
peculiar
facts
that
you
referred
to?
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it
that
what
you
are
suggesting
to
us
is
that
there
are
so
many
nuances
and
so
many
elements
in
this
that
it's
something
for
a
legislative
body
to
weigh,
not
for
a
court,
which
has
no
facilities
for
hearings,
to
get
into?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
cellini.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
attorney
general
indicated
general
approbation
of
the
idea
in
broad
terms,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
burger
ibm
is...
about
12
up
to
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
slater?
chief
justice
burger
he
presumably
picks
out
the
most
convenient
and
the
most
vulnerable,
wouldn't
you
think
that
would
be
a
litigation
tactic?
chief
justice
burger
well,
maybe
he
even
thinks
that
if
there's
no
right
of
contribution
he
might
get
a
little
aid
and
comfort
from
some
of
the
others.
chief
justice
burger
anything
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
burger
but
in
a
criminal
case,
the
prosecution
sometimes
will
let
one
guilty
fellow
off
in
order
to
get
his
help
in
the
prosecution.
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
