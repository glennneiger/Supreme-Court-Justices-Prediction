mr.
dando
b.
cellini
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
occasion
marks
at
least
two
firsts
for
me.
it's
the
first
time
i've
had
the
privilege
of
arguing
a
case
to
this
court,
and
also
the
first
time
i've
been
upbraided
by
my
adversary
for
attempting
to
focus
the
court's
attention
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
before
it.
i'm
usually
criticized
for
doing
just
the
opposite.
here,
however,
petitioner's
reply
brief
starts
off
by
saying
that
i
have
attempted
to
focus
the
court's
attention
on
the
peculiar
and
purely
fortuitous
facts
of
this
case.
that's
one
point
in
this
argument
that
i'm
going
to
readily
concede.
i
have
attempted
to
do
that,
i've
done
it
for
what
i
believe
to
be
good
reasons.
first
of
all,
i'm
mindful
of
the
truism
which
this
court
has
often
repeated
that
the
business
of
the
federal
courts
is
constitutionally
restricted
to
the
cases
and
controversies
that
come
before
it.
and
secondly,
i've
focused
on
the
facts
now
before
the
court
in
this
case,
because
the
petitioner
has
persisted
in
asserting
a
value
judgment
sort
of
argument
that
equates
contribution
with
fairness
and
no
contribution
with
unfairness.
i
find
that
theme
has
been
repeated
consistently
throughout
the
briefs.
in
fact,
the
last
words
mr.
slater
said
when
he
sat
down
today,
the
last
word
he
said,
was
"unfair".
and
i
find
that
an
ethereal
theme.
it's
without
substance,
it's
without
standards,
and
it
can't
form
the
basis
for
rational
decisionmaking.
and
i
have
found
no
better
way
to
illustrate
that
point
than
to
see
how
contribution
would
work
in
the
facts
of
the
case
that
is
now
before
the
court.
now,
my
colleague
and
friend,
mr.
slater,
i
believe,
has
given
you
all
of
the
critical
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
he's
really
given
you
the
flavor
of
the
situation
in
which
this
case
arose.
so
if
i
might
take
a
couple
of
minutes
of
the
court's
time
to
go
back
over
some
of
these
facts,
this
case
goes
back
as
far
as
1968.
according
to
the
indictments
that
were
handed
down
in
1973
by
a
federal
jury
in
new
orleans,
a
conspiracy
took
place
among
petitioner,
respondents,
and
certain
individuals,
sometime
in
the
middle
of
1968
to
about
the
middle
of
1970,
in
which
these
parties
agreed
to
fix
prices
on
concrete.
these
indictments
were
returned
in
1973;
nolo
pleas
were
entered
by
the
companies
involved
and
the
individuals
involved.
since
we're
arguing
this
case
on
mardi
gras
day,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
individuals
involved
was
a
former
king
of
carnival
in
new
orleans,
which
is
the
highest
honor
that
that
city
can
bestow
upon
one
of
its
citizens.
he
was
sent
to
jail.
another
one
of
the
individuals
involved
was
the
president-elect
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
as
the
court
can
well
imagine--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
pointing
out...
the
point
i
am
making
with
respect
to
this
is
that
everyone
in
new
orleans
knew
about
this
alleged
conspiracy,
and
in
1973
a
number
of
plaintiffs
filed
suit
to
recover
damages
against
the
parties
that
were
charged
with
this
conspiracy
in
the
indictment.
and
all
of
that,
as
the
petitioner
points
out
in
his
reply
brief,
was
resolved
by
compromise.
and
then,
a
couple
of
years
later,
in
1975,
abraham
construction
company
filed
this
lawsuit,
the
original
lawsuit
which
gave
rise
to
this
claim.
and
in
that
lawsuit
texas
industries
was
the
only
party
sued.
now,
as
mr.
slater
conceded
in
his
oral
argument...
don'
t
think
that
there
is
any
question
about
this,
there
is
no
collusion
involved
here...
the
only
apparent
reason
why
texas
industries
was
the
party
that
was
sued
by
abraham
construction
is
because
texas
industries
is
the
party
that
sold
concrete
to
abraham
construction.
abraham
construction
concluded
that
it
paid
overcharges
in
the
amount
of
$200,000
to
texas
industries,
so
it
filed
suit
against
texas
industries
saying,
give
me
that
$200,000
back,
trebled,
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
texas
industries
asserts
this
third
party
claim,
and
as
justice
stevens
noted
in
the
course
of
the
argument
of
mr.
slater,
the
mathematical
computation
that
would
be
involved
in
working
out
how
this
claim
would
be
resolved
ultimately,
if
a
contribution
remedy
ware
allowed,
would
allow
texas
industries
to
keep
$50,000
of
that
money
it
got
from
abraham.
not
only
would
it
escape
all
liability
to
abraham,
it
would
actually
get
to
keep
$50,000
of
that
money.
now,
what's
involved
here
is--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--certainly
there
are
going
to
be
other
factors
involved,
your
honor.
but
i
point
these
facts
out
because
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
in
instinctive
emotional
reaction
to
this
fact
situation
based
on
what
is
perceived
to
be
fair,
would
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
texas
industries
ought
not
be
allowed
to
keep
all
that
money,
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
keep
$50,000
and
escape
all
liability
to
abraham.
if
you
were
going
to
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
of
an
emotional
response
to
what
is
fair,
the
way
you
would
do
it
to
deny
the
contribution
remedy
that
texas
industries
seeks.
i
am
not
asking--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
my
argument
would
reject
it
in
all
contexts,
your
honor.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
yes,
sir.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
without
congress
saying
so.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
no,
your
honor.
and
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
if
it
considers
all
of
these
amicus
briefs
and
considers
this
particular
fact
situation,
what
can
be
gleaned
from
examining
all
of
those
situations
is
that
you
need
to
do
more
than
form
some
sort
of
instinctive
reaction
to
what
is
fair.
you
can't
do
that.
in
some
situations
contribution
looks
to
be
fair;
in
some
situations
it
looks
to
be
unfair.
so
what
needs
to
be
done
is,
you
have
to
look
at
the
underlying
public
policy
considerations
that
gave
rise
to
this
statute,
to
this
no-contribution
rule,
and
you
have
to
look
to
the
practical
considerations.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
mr.
justice,
mr.
slater
is
correct
in
stating
the
present
rule,
which
is
that
the
plaintiff
can
choose
who
he
wants--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--i
know
of
no
case
in
which
that
has
been
done.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
i
would
not
be
so
bold
as
to
say
he
could
not,
your
honor.
i've
never
seen
it
done.
i
know
of
no
authority
for
doing
it.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
there
are
specific
fact
situations,
as
i've
tried
to
argue
to
the
court,
in
which
a
contribution
remedy
is
attractive,
and
there
are
specific
fact
situations
in
which
it
doesn't
look
attractive
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
you--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--there
have
been
a
couple
of
states
that
have
fashioned--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--yes,
your
honor.
in
most--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--no,
your
honor.
these
are
under
state
laws.
if
there
is
a
general
rule--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--i
know
of
none
under
state
antitrust
laws.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
that's
the
minority
rule.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
contribution
against
intentional
tortfeasors
is
a
minority
rule.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
yes.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
even
statutory,
your
honor,
because
under
the
uniform
contribution
among
tortfeasors
act,
under
the
restatement
on
restitution,
an
exemption
is
created.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
in
nonintentional
torts,
the
majority
rule
would
now
be
in
favor
of
contribution,
taking
into
consideration
statutory--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
i
certainly
couldn't
have
said
it
any
better,
and
i
certainly
couldn't
have
said
it
as
forcefully,
your
honor.
i
think
the
deterrence
issue
is
a
great
example
of
the
difficulties
in
assessing
the
policy
situations
involved.
the
5th
circuit
concluded
that
the
rule
against
contribution
enhances
deterrents,
because
of
the
uncertainty
it
creates
among
potential
conspirators.
in
accordance
with
prevailing
economic
theory
the
5th
circuit
said
that
businessmen
are
risk-averse;
they
are
less
prone
to
take
a
big
chance
of
getting
a
small...
they
are
deterred
more
by
the
slight
prospect
of
a
large
loss
than
by
the
strong
prospect
of
a
small
loss.
and
that
result
comports
with
common
sense,
as
well
as
prevailing
economic
theory.
if
you
could
do
as
what
mr.
slater
suggested
in
this
case
and
seek
contribution,
you
could
in
effect
conduct
a
sort
of
cost-benefit
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
would
be
beneficial
to
you
to
engage
in
an
antitrust
conspiracy,
and
there
could
be
many
situations
where
it
would
be
of
positive
benefit
to
engage
in
an
antitrust
conspiracy.
i
have
gauged
one
possible
fact
situation
along
these
lines
on
page
20
in
my
brief,
where
i
posited
a
situation
where
one
company
controls
45
percent
of
the
market
and
knows
that
under
a
per
capita
contribution
rule
it
is
only
going
to
get
tagged
with
a
by-head
share
of
any
conspiracy.
and
there
are
a
dozen
people
in
that
particular
market.
under
those
circumstances,
that
company
with
the
dominant
share
in
the
market...
i
posited
45
percent,
but
you
could
pick
any
number...
that
company
would
have
a
positive
incentive
under
a
contribution
rule
to
go
ahead
and
either
force
by
threats
or
entice
the
other
companies
involved
in
the
industry
to
join
in
a
conspiracy,
because
it
knows
it
stands
to
benefit
far
more
than
it
could
ever
lose
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
that's
one
of
the
more
difficult
situations,
your
honor,
and
as
i
started
off
addressing
the
court,
i
think
that
you
can't
look
at
specific
situations.
you
have
to
look
at
the
policy
considerations
behind
the
no
contribution
rule,
why
it
came
into
effect.
i
think
deterrence
is
one
those
important
policies.
another
one
is
that
contributions
would
deter
settlements.
obviously,
if
someone
could
be
bought
back
into
litigation--
mr.
dando
b.
cellini
--it
shows
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
policy
considerations,
mr.
justice.
you
have
some
of
these
amicus
briefs
that
argue
that
we
need
contribution
because
it
will
enhance
deterrence.
in
fact,
mr.
slater
took
that
position
before
the
court
today.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
other
amicus
briefs
that
say
that
we
need
contribution
because
the
present
rule
results
in
overdeterrence.
i
think
the
best
summing
up
of
the
problem
before
the
court
was
made
by
the
court
in
the
olson
farms
decision
when
it
said,
this
is
a
complex
policy
thinking,
that
we
ought
to
leave
to
congress...
and
this
matter
is
before
congress
right
now;
there
was
legislation
introduced
in
congress
in
1979
under
which
a
contribution
remedy
would
be
created.
now,
congress
has
not
taken
action
on
that.
it's
pending
on
the
floor
of
congress
right
now.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
strong
evidence
that
congress
did
not
initially
mean
to
create
a
contribution
remedy
when
it
passed
the
antitrust
laws,
and
that
the
matter
ought
to
be
left
to
congress.
now,
mr.
slater
reads
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
in
such
a
way
that
he
asserts
a
contribution
remedy
could
be
fashioned
out
of
it.
what
he
says
is,
that
if
you
don't
do
that,
people
can
get
off
scot
free,
and
the
rule
was
meant
to
punish
all
violators.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
any
person
who
shall
be
injured
may
sue
therefor.
it
does
not
say,
in
accordance
with
mr.
slater's
analysis,
every
person
who
was
injured
must
sue
therefor.
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
in
favor
of
the
person
injured,
not
in
favor
of
someone
who
has
violated
the
statute
and
now
seeks
to
either
escape
liability
entirely,
as
is
the
case
in
this
situation,
or
at
least
spread
its
liability
among
everyone
that
conceivably
could
have
participated
in
the
conspiracy.
i
think
there
is
no
basis
upon
which,
unlike
the
securities
laws,
a
cause
of
action
contribution
could
be
implied
from
this
statute.
and
certainly
the
historical
background
of
the
sherman
act
doesn't
suggest
any
basis
on
which
such
a
remedy
could
be
implied
from
the
statute.
but
that
point
has
been
dealt
with
at
some
length
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
in
his
brief
to
this
court.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
can
present
that
point
more
forcefully
than
i
could.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
directed
to
me
i
would
respectfully
like
to
cede
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
the
solicitor
general.
