justice
stewart
mr.
slater,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
makes
the
point
that
i
found
quite
an
intriguing
point,
that
while
you
present
this
case
as
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
right,
or
should
be
or
should
not
be,
and
you
say
there
should
be,
and
is...
a
right
of
contribution
in
antitrust
suits
among
joint
tortfeasors,
the
point
made
by
the
amicus
brief
is
that
this
question
can
arise
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
maybe
there's
no
single
correct
answer
in
every
context.
now,
you've
already
given
us
a
context
that
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
person
did
not
sue
four
people,
this
plaintiff.
he
sued
only
one.
and
in
this
case
you
claim
contribution
from
the
unsued
coconspirators.
you
have
just
given
us
an
example
of
sued
coconspirators
against
whom
judgments
are
made,
and
talking
about
the
execution
of
those
judgments.
then,
there's
a
lot
of
talk
in
these
amicus
briefs
about
carving
and
contribution
as
against
settling,
codefendants
and
so
on,
which
also
are
not
involved
in
this
case,
and
to
which
the
answer
might
be
different.
do
you
think
it's
a
single
question,
or
do
you
think
that
it's
many
questions,
and
that
the
answer
may
be
different
according
to
the
question
in
each
separate
context?
justice
stewart
and
there'd
be
talk
of
it,
we're
here
about
to
bargain
now...
then,
about...
and
so
on.
justice
stewart
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
settlement.
justice
stewart
well,
it's
always
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
settlement,
by
the
amount
of
the
money
the
plaintiff
gets.
justice
stewart
that's
done
under
the
present
law,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
even
though
that
conspirator
had
a
90
percent
market
share?
justice
stewart
or
even
if
that
conspirator
had
a
one
percent
market
share.
justice
stewart
it
would
still
be
ten
percent
under
that.
justice
stewart
and
even
though
that
conspirator
had
never
done
business
with
the
plaintiff?
justice
stewart
and
couldn't...
if
three
people
settled
for
less
than
the
claim,
couldn't
the
plaintiff
just
tailor
the
cloth
to
meet
the
situation
by
increasing
the
ad
damnum
in
his
complaint?
justice
stewart
well,
you
never
know
that
in
advance--
justice
stewart
well,
in
the
securities
area
the
federal
statutes
themselves
provide
for
contribution,
do
they
not?
many
of
them?
justice
stewart
of
course
the
right
of
action
is
an
implied?
justice
stewart
of
course,
they
may
not
be
liable
to
this
plaintiff
at
all,
since
they
never
sold
him
anything.
justice
stewart
this
plaintiff
might
not
be
able
to
sue
them
at
all.
justice
stewart
they
still
could?
justice
stewart
no;
all
right.
justice
stewart
their
argument
is
that
if
you've
got
than
three
conspirators,
the
one
conspirator
who
had
all
the
sales
will
wind
up
with
a
net
profit.
justice
stewart
that
would
only
be
true,
wouldn't
it,
when
you
had
more
than
three
conspirators,
if
you're
talking
about
treble
damages?
justice
stewart
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
but
i
was
just
wondering--
justice
stewart
that
formula
doesn't
count
attorneys'
fees,
does
it?
justice
stewart
that's
assuming
that
mr.
slater
were
working
for
free.
justice
stewart
do
you
think...
as
you
know,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
litigation,
with
many
of
them
directed
to
questions
that
aren't
really
at
issue
here.
justice
stewart
such
as
claim
reduction
and
various
other
things,
and
one
very
appealing
one,
for
example,
by
the
mead
corporation
involving
a
question
that
isn't
presented
here.
would
you
reject,
would
your
argument
reject
contribution
in
all
contexts?
justice
stewart
well,
state
torts,
generally
i
think,
aren't
there?
justice
stewart
there
are
a
lot
of
those.
justice
stewart
that's
the
litigation,
i
think,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
has
engendered
a
good
many
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
because
i
think
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
settled
seriatim
with
many
of
the
defendants
and
upped
the
ante
each
time,
and
left
the
mead
corporation
holding
the
bag,
as
it
says.
justice
stewart
no,
and
that
involves
related
questions
of
claim
limitation
and
carving
out,
and
so
on,
which
are
not...
and
settling
with
defendants;
none
of
which
issues
are
present
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
--the
plaintiff
would
have
obtained
his
judgment
then,
presumably.
justice
stewart
well,
whether
or
not
they're
liable
depends
upon
whether
or
not
you
win.
