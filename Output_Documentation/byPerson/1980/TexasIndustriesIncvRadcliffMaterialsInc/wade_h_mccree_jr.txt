mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
interest
of
the
government
in
this
litigation
stems
from
its
concern
for
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
particularly
from
its
interest
in
insuring
the
continuing
effectiveness
of
private
actions
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
particularly
to
accomplish
the
twin
goals
of
the
antitrust
act,
which
are
compensation
to
the
injured
and
deterrence
of
would-be
violators.
we
submit
that
permitting
defendants
to
seek
contribution
may
or
may
not
affect
the
deterrence
of
private
actions
but
certainly
it
will
so
complicate
litigation
as
to
hamper
and
perhaps
frustrate
the
recovery
by
injured
plaintiffs.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that's
a
metaphor
that
i
would
adopt,
particularly
in
the
deterrence.
we
just
don't
know
which
way
it's
going
to
fall,
and
we
have
referred
to
the
economic
analysts
in
our
brief,
as
has
my
brother
cellini,
and
their
conclusions
are
conflicting
and
indeterminate.
but
everyone
is
certain
that
to
have
contribution
in
already
complex
antitrust
cases
would
almost
unmanageably
confuse
and
complicate
already
complicated
antitrust
litigation.
we
suggest
that
the
congress
is
the
proper
body
in
the
federal
picture
to
address
this
subject
because
of
its
many
complexities.
the
court
in
its
colloquy
with
counsel
that
have
preceded
me
has
pointed
out
effectively
that
there
are
many
facets
to
this
question
of
contribution,
and
that
it
can
be
applied
in
many
ways.
the
manner
in
which
it
might
be
afford
lends
itself
to
at
least
three
analyses.
one,
of
course,
the
pro
rata
amount,
which
depends
on
numbers
alone;
the
market
share
amount,
which
depends
upon
how
much
was
sold;
and
the
other,
the
degree
culpability,
which
of
course,
would
require
even
more
from
the
district
judge
confronted
with
this
determination.
whether
one
or
all
of
these
would
be
applied
in
some
combination
in
a
particular
case
doesn't
lend
itself
easily
to
judicial
determination,
and
is
more
properly
addressed
to
the
congress,
which
has
the
capacity
for
fine
tuning.
we
suggest
that
this
court
or
the--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--i
don't
like
to
speculate
about
it,
but
the
congress
at
least
thought
it
worthy
of
its
attention
in
1979
when
it
addressed
the
subject
and
invited
testimony
from
interested
sources
and
even
came
up
with
a
bill.
they
failed
to
pass
it,
but--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--indeed,
he
did,
but
he
also
stressed
the
complexities
and
suggested
that
it
was
premature
to
take
a
firm
position.
and
we
think
that
the
congress
has
the
capacity,
at
least,
to
receive
the
testimony
of
the
economic
analysts
and
others
to
inform
its
judgment,
something
that
an
individual
district
court
would
not
have,
and
certainly
this
court
does
not
have,
with
the
other
matters
that
affect
it.
we
suggest
that
the
proper
analysis
to
this
problem
is
to
regard
the
antitrust
laws,
as
they
are,
as
creating
statutory
remedies,
and
we
think
the
court
should
pursue
the
analysis
that
it
has
suggested
in
other
instances
when
it
sought
to
endeavor
whether
the
congress
implied
a
cause
of
action.
cort
v.
ash,
and
the
cannon
v.
the
university
of
chicago,
suggest
that
the
first
inquiry
should
be,
is
the
person
seeking
an
implied
cause
of
action
a
person
for
whose
benefit
the
statute
was
enacted?
i
think
it's
entirely
clear,
that
the
law
violator,
the
tortfeasor,
is
not
the
person
for
whose
benefit
this
law
was
enacted.
and
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
for
contribution
for
him
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
followed
in
addressing
other
questions
of
this
sort.
the
congress
which
enacted,
of
course,
the
antitrust
laws,
has
revised
the
antitrust
laws
from
time
to
time.
1914
was
the
clayton
act,
of
course;
and
again
in
1974
and
1976
without
ever
authorizing
contribution.
yet,
the
literature
has
suggested
contribution
before
those
periods,
and
the
congress
didn't
decide
that
it
was
even
worth
taking
up
until
1979
after
the
professional
beauty
supply
v.
national
beauty
supply
case,
and
has
just
begun
to
address
it.
and
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
properly
defer
to
congress's
prerogative
the
priority
here
and
permit
it
to
wrestle
with
some
of
these
difficult
problems
that
have
been
outlined
this
afternoon.
i'd
like
to
suggest
a
case
which
is
referred
to
on
page
16
of
our
brief,
in
re
corrugated
container
antitrust
litigation.
here
there
were
38
named
defendants
in
a
private
antitrust
suit,
each
of
which
could
seek
contribution,
and
if
one
can
only
imagine
the
district
judge
confronted
with
third
party
actions
of
that
magnitude,
trying
to
fashion
a
remedy
for
an
injured
plaintiff.
also,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--indeed
it
has.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
will
always
be
appealing
situations,
although
we
think
the
case
before
the
court
at
this
time
is
not
such
a
case,
and--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--we
agree
completely,
with
the
court's
observation,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
we
think
this
is
another
reason
why
we
shouldn't
do
this.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
that
is
a
suggestion,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
has
been
made.
however,
the
plaintiff
would
then,
or
the
party
seeking
contribution,
would
have
to
go
forward
again
and
establish
the
liability
of
the
person
he
sought
to
have
contribute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
oh,
it
would
ease
the
court's
problem
but
it
would
just
make
for
further
litigation
with
the
liability
question
unaddressed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
there'd
just
be
that
many
more
lawsuits
after
the
fact.
the
proceedings
before
the
congress,
in
considering
amendments
to
antitrust
proceedings
recently...
i
think
this
is
found
on
page
4
of
the
antitrust
procedural
improvement
act,
congressional
report...
observes
that
many
antitrust
cases
take
5-1/2
years
to
litigate,
and
that
the
average
is
four
years,
and
if
one
were
to
graft
on
to
that
burden
the
problem
of
seeking
contribution,
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
just
how
far
we
would
go.
the
congress
very
recently--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--mr.
justice
marshall,
that's
an
entire
judicial
career.
the
congress
recently
commissioned
a
number
of
new
district
judges
and
their
average
age,
i
think,
was
about
50.
and
their
eligibility
for
taking
senior
status
comes
at
age
65,
and
i
would
think
that
one
of
those
judges
could
spend
15
years
easily
with
that
litigation,
and
perhaps
have
it
as
a
legacy
for
his
successor.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
didn't
intend
to
have
a
parade
of
horrors
before
the
court
but
i
think
i've
identified
who
should
be
the
leader
of
such
a
procession
if
we
did.
we
suggest,
then,
that
this
is
appropriately
the
kind
of
case,
or
the
kind
of
matter,
that
should
be
left
to
the
congress
for
its
resolution,
and
just
because
of
these
many
complexities.
one
more
i'd
like
to
refer
to
before
i
take
my
seat.
mr.
justice
white
inquired
about
the
restatement
and
its
position,
i
think,
on
contribution.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
very
well.
well,
then
i
won't--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
--thank
you.
i
will
not
have
to
refer
to
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
the
government
will
rest
on
its
brief
as
filed.
thank
you.
