how
do
cases
get
before
the
board?
justice
white
how
does
he
know
that?
justice
white
but
how
does
he
even
know
he
can
apply?
has
the
board
issued
any
rules
about
how
you're
supposed
to
proceed?
justice
white
well,
does
the
board...
has
the
board
issued
procedural
regulations?
if
you
want
to
come
before
us,
you
do
this,
and
you
do
that?
justice
white
and
does
it
indicate
what
must
be
contained
in
the
petition?
what
do
they
call
it?
a
petition
or
what?
justice
white
but
is
there...
does
the
board
provide
a
form?
justice
white
yes,
and
do
they...
and
the
form
says,
please
give
reasons
why,
or
does
it
say,
does
it
ask
some
specific
questions
that
it
wants
answers
to?
justice
white
so,
it
doesn't
indicate
at
all
any
of
the
reasons
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
board?
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
the
next
step
after
that
be
that
if
the
inmate
denied
the
reason,
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
would
say
it
would
be
constitutionally
required?
justice
white
if
this
was
a
liberty...
if
it's
a
liberty
interest?
justice
white
no,
only
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
mechanism
of
some
kind,
a
hearing
or
some
other
suitable?
justice
white
how
about
an
attorney?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
now,
but,
soon?
justice
white
well,
why
wouldn't
it
satisfy
your
requirement
if
all
members
of
the
board
indicated
his
reasons
individually
and
they
had
no
meeting
of
the
board?
justice
white
and
it
wouldn't
need
to
have
a
meeting
or
deliberate.
justice
white
how
many
members
of
the
board
are
there?
justice
white
so
he
might
have
been
told
five
different
reasons?
justice
white
well,
and
as
long
as
you
don't
challenge
it
as
being
inaccurate,
in
which
event
you
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
review
procedure.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
are
also
saying,
i'm
sure,
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
required?
justice
white
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said,
just
inaccurate
grounds.
justice
white
well,
review
by
whom?
justice
white
i
know,
but
would
you
say
the
constitution
required
judicial
review
of
it?
justice
white
in
abolishing
parole
did
connecticut
also
set
definite
terms
for
certain
crimes?
justice
white
and
eliminated
judicial
discretion
to
a
great
degree?
justice
white
so
a
good
many
times
it
wouldn't
do
a
judge
any
good
to
have
any
reason
at
all?
he's
just
required
to
impose
a
sentence?
justice
white
but
connecticut
has
retained,
while
eliminating
discretion,
has
retained
this
provision
giving
the
board
complete
discretion
on
parole?
justice
white
well,
it
would
be
the
next...
it
would
a
consistent
step
to
take
for
connecticut
to
eliminate
this
discretionary
part
of
sentencing
also,
wouldn't
it?
