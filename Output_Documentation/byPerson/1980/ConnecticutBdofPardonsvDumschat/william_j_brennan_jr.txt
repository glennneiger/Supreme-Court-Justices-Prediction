justice
jr.
what
was
the
average
time,
mr.
o'neill?
justice
jr.
of
service?
justice
jr.
for
about
75
percent,
is
it,
of
those
sentenced
under
these
sentences?
justice
jr.
in
that
sense,
there
was
a
pattern,
was
there?
justice
jr.
of
parole
within
14
to
17
years?
justice
jr.
pardon,
within
14
to
17
years.
justice
jr.
well,
may
i
ask,
may
we
accept
that
as
what
the
practice
has
been?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
o'neill,
is
it...
am
i
correct
that
the
practice,
or
rather,
procedure
followed
by
the
board
is,
unless
a
member
of
the
board
moves
that
a
pardon
be
granted,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
there's
no
consideration
whether
or
not
a
pardon
should
be
granted.
doesn't
some
member
of
the
board,
as
a
matter
of
the
board's
procedures,
actually
have
to
move
it?
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
but
what
if
someone
doesn't
say
he'd
like
to
discuss
stephen
o'neill's
case,
there's
no
consideration
of
pardon
for
stephen
o'neill?
justice
jr.
oh,
that
is
consideration?
justice
jr.
if
a
reason
were
given
to
stephen
o'neill
in
that
circumstance,
what
would
the
reason
be?
no
member
of
the
board
moved
your
case?
justice
jr.
for
someone
to
move
it?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
wizner,
what
mr.
o'neill
told
us,
or
i
thought
he
did,
about
their
present
practice,
which
is
that
they
have
a
list
of
names.
if
no
one
raises
a
particular
name
as
one
for
consideration,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter
as
to
him.
now,
they'd
have
to
change
all
that
now
under
your
submission,
would
they
not?
justice
jr.
now,
what
they'd
have
to
do,
they'd
have
to
sit
down,
they'd
have
to
take
up
john
jones,
or
stephen
o'neill,
and
decide
that,
why
in
stephen
o'neill's
case
they
ought
not
grant
it
if
they're
not
going
to.
then
they'd
have
to
agree
on
a
reason,
wouldn't
they?
justice
jr.
by
a
majority
vote
or
something
like
that?
justice
jr.
they'd
have
to
agree
upon
the
reason,
wouldn't
they?
justice
jr.
they'd
have
to
agree
by
majority
vote,
then,
on
a
single
reason?
justice
jr.
each
of
them,
jones,
smith,
so
forth,
can
have
a
separate
reason?
justice
jr.
and
if
one
or
more
of
the
five
is
incorrect,
what
to
do?
get
a
review
by
the
full
board?
justice
jr.
if
we
have
five
separate
reasons,
as
you
suggest
would
satisfy
the
requirement,
but
one
or
two
is
incorrect,
what
happens
then?
justice
jr.
nevertheless,
there
may
be
a
stated
reason
by
one
of
the
board
members
that
the
prisoner
says,
that
just
isn't
true.
that
simply
isn't
true.
justice
jr.
even
though
the
other
four
were
accepted?
justice
jr.
well,
let's
suppose
one
of
the
five
says,
i'm
not
going
to
vote
to
give
you
a
pardon,
because
you
battered
your
cellmate
over
the
head
with
a
club
the
other
day.
and
he
says,
i
never
did
anything
of
the
kind,
that's
not
true,
i
never
did
anything
of
the
kind.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
suggesting
that
he's
entitled
to
some
kind
of
administrative
review
of
the
truth
of
that,
isn't
he?
justice
jr.
i
know.
but
he
says,
it
isn't
true,
and
the
board
then
has
to
hear
him
and
decide
whether
it's
true
or
not.
right?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but
he
says,
i
will
carry
the
burden
of
proving
that
i
never
did
anything
of
the
kind.
it's
just
not
true.
i
didn't
do
that.
and
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier
that
he'd
be
entitled
to
review
by
the
board
of
of
such
claim?
justice
jr.
all
right,
and
the
member
who
gave
that
reason
is
finally
persuaded
that,
no,
it
wasn't
true,
and
i
withdraw
those
reasons.
what
does
he
get?
justice
jr.
four
other
members
have
given
other
reasons
which
he
hasn't
challenged.
