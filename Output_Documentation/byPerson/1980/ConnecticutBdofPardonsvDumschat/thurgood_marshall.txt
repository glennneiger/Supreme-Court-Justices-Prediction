justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
maybe
i
missed
it,
but
what
is
the
reason
that
they
don't
give
reasons?
justice
marshall
is
there
a
statute
that
says
that
they
don't
have
to
give
the
reasons?
justice
marshall
you
don't
say?
now,
again,
do
you
have
any
reason?
justice
marshall
i
still
want
to
know
what
the
reason
is
why
you
couldn't
give
a
reason?
justice
marshall
there
is
no
reason,
right?
justice
marshall
well,
if
there
are
five,
give
me
one
of
the
five.
justice
marshall
i
don't
see
how
mr.
justice
stewart
can
sit
here
in
washington
and
know
what's
going
on
in
the
board
in
connecticut.
well,
i
just
read
the
connecticut
statute,
and
that
must
be
the
reason
in
every
case.
well,
i'm
asking...
i'm
asking
this,
now.
justice
marshall
you're
speaking
for
the
state
of
connecticut,
right?
justice
marshall
for
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
i'm
asking
you,
finally,
for
the
last
time,
a
reason
for
not
giving
reasons.
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean,
that's
your
idea
of
a
reason.
justice
marshall
that's
your
idea
of
a
reason?
justice
marshall
didn't
one
member
of
the
board
or
former
member
testify
there
would
be
no
problem
in
giving
a
reason?
justice
marshall
mr.
wizner?
justice
marshall
what
would
happen
if
they
gave
the
following
reason?
no
member
of
the
board
having
wished
to
discuss
it,
we
didn't
discuss
it.
justice
marshall
would
that
be
enough
reason?
justice
marshall
would
you
mind
addressing
to
what
kind
of
reason?
justice
marshall
because,
you
know,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
we've
spelt
out
what
reasons
ought
to
be
given.
justice
marshall
in
due
process
things.
justice
marshall
and
does
the
2nd
circuit
have
a
rule
for
rehearing
which
says,
"no
active
judge
having
voted
for
rehearing,
the
rehearing
is
denied?
"
isn't
that
a
reason?
justice
marshall
isn't
that
a
reason?
justice
marshall
but...
i'm
just
working
on
the
word,
"reason".
justice
marshall
what
kind
of
reason,
please?
justice
marshall
--mr.
wizner,
have
you
ever
read
an
opinion
of
a
court
which
says,
"we
have
examined
all
of
the
points
raised
and
find
no
merit
in
any
of
them?
"
justice
marshall
yes.
well,
would
that
be
all
right
if
this
board
said,
we
have
examined
this
whole
case
of
mr....
whatever
this
man's
name
was?
justice
marshall
well,
marshall,
and
we
find
no
merit
in
it.
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient?
justice
marshall
why
would
that...
would
a
conviction
that
puts
a
man
in
jail
not
require
it,
but
this
one
to
get
out
of
jail
does
require
it?
justice
marshall
well,
what
rules
are
there
in
connecticut
that
tell
the
court
how
to
decide
a
case?
justice
marshall
well,
what
statute?
does
the
statute
say
what
you
must
find?
justice
marshall
does
the
statute
define
what
reasons
have
to
be
given?
justice
marshall
does
the
statute
say
what
reason
the
appellate
court
has
to
give?
that's
what
i
was
talking
about.
justice
marshall
right.
justice
marshall
now
we're
back
to
your
case,
in
which
you
say
that
for
this
reason
you
must
get
more
than
you
get
out
of
an
appellate
court.
justice
marshall
well,
didn't
some
of
your
people
go
all
through
a
trial
and
an
appeal?
justice
marshall
i
thought
so.
i'm
ready
to
bet
anything
you
want
to
get
more
now
than
you
got
all
the
way
up.
justice
marshall
you
see
my
problem
with
that?
justice
marshall
mr.
wizner?
justice
marshall
is
it
true
that
in
connecticut
you
can
appeal
the
sentence?
