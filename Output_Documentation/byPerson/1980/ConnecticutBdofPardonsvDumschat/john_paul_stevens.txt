justice
stevens
mr.
o'neill,
i
gather
that
in
a
fairly
large
number
of
cases
the
board
does
act
favorably
to
the
request
for
shortening
the
sentence?
justice
stevens
yes.
and
when
it
does
that,
does
it
give
a
statement
of
reasons?
justice
stevens
it
just
acts
without
explanation,
either
granting
or...
well
what...
and
there's
an
issue
in
this
case,
or
at
least
there's
a
question
in
the
case
as
to...
if
there
is
some
kind
of
a
liberty
interest
at
some
point
in
time,
nobody's
really
decided
when
it
might
attach,
and
i
guess
the
lower
courts
were
at
the
view
it
depends
on
how
soon
there's
a
significant
number
of
people
who
are
getting
some
kind
of
relief.
what
is
in...
at
what
point
in
the
general
sentence
of
a
life
termer,
at
what
point
do
most
of
them
finally
get
some
kind
of
relief
from
the
board?
do
you
have
the
experience
on
that
subject?
justice
stevens
then
over
half
of
them
would
get
some
kind
of
relief?
justice
stevens
do
you
know
on
the
basis
of
your
experience
what
is
the
general...
well,
why
do
they
let
75
percent
of
the
people
out
early?
it's
sort
of
strange.
is
there
any
guideline
of
any
kind
telling
them
what
sort
of
rules
to
follow
or
procedures,
formal
or
informal?
justice
stevens
these
are
all
cases
in
which
the
legislature
has
provided
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
and
in
75
percent
of
cases
the
board
of
pardons
just
decides
to
overrule
the
legislature,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
says,
well,
we
really
don't
mean
it
in
75
percent
of
the
cases,
is
what
it
boils
down
to,
i
guess.
in
some
states,
and
i
think
it
has
happened
with
the
president
of
the
united
states,
a
pardon
or
dispensation
has
been
granted
on
a
showing,
for
example,
that
the
prisoner
has
been
in
prison
for
15
years,
he
has
a
terminal
cancer,
has
a
year
to
live
or
less,
and
he
wants
to
die
at
home.
does
that
happen
in
connecticut?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
not
in
75
percent
of
the
cases,
i
don't
suppose?
justice
stevens
mr.
wizner,
isn't
it
probable
in
the
case
where
a
board
member
relied
on
a
disciplinary
infraction,
that
would
have
been
supplied
to
him
in
some
kind
of
a
report
as
a
result
of
a
proceeding
that
had
already
taken
place?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
know
about
the
facts
that
go
on
in
the
prison,
other
than
what's
supplied
at
the
board
hearings.
justice
stevens
and
the
review
presumably
would
have
already
been
had
on
that
kind
of
an
issue.
justice
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you've
said
everything
you
want
to
say
on
the
question
of,
why
must
these
officials
give
reasons
when
judges
don't
have
to
give
reasons
in
a
whole
host
of
situations?
and
the
one
that
i
find
the
closest,
frankly,
is
the
sentencing
function
performed
by
the
trial
judge.
does
your
position
require
as
a
matter
of
consistency
that
we
also
say
a
trial
judge
should
have
to
give
reasons
when
he
decides
how
long
a
sentence
shall
be
imposed?
justice
stevens
and
why
not?
justice
stevens
that's
right.
here
we've
got
outer
bounds
too.
justice
stevens
trial
judges
do
this
too.
some
judges
give
certain
sentences
in
certain
kinds
of
crimes,
but
they
just
don't
bother
to
say
so.
why
wouldn't
your
argument
compel
this
end?
and
i'm
not
saying
this
necessarily
makes
your
argument
wrong,
but
is
there
really
a
principal
distinction
between
what
you're
asking
us
to
hold
for
this
part
of
the
sentencing
process...
because,
in
a
sense,
this
is
really
a
part
of
the
sentencing
process...
is
this
really
constitutionally
different
from
what
the
trial
judge
does
at
the
time
that
the
man
is
found
guilty?
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true
your
90
percent
figure
is
a
little
bit
misleading
because
in
any
set
of
applicants
in
one
day,
90
percent
of
those
don't
get
relief
on
that
day?
