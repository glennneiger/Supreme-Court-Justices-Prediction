justice
blackmun
mr.
o'neill,
your
opposition
really
isn't
asking
for
very
much
here,
is
it?
just
a
statement
of
reasons?
justice
blackmun
do
you
feel
that
your
board
of
pardons
is
able
to
deny
relief
for
no
reason
at
all?
justice
blackmun
or
any
governor,
where
there
is
still
executive
clemency?
incidentally,
do
you
have
any
vestige
of
executive
clemency
in
the
state
of
connecticut?
justice
blackmun
but
otherwise,
your
board
of
pardons
system
has
taken
over
completely?
