mr.
stephen
wizner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
applied
this
court's
decision
in
greenholtz
v.
nebraska
penal
inmates
to
the
sentence
commutation
process
for
a
few
life
inmates
in
connecticut.
and
the
reason
that
i
emphasize
a
1975--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--that's
right,
justice
stewart.
and
the
answer
to
this
question
must
be
found
in
the
practices
of
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
because
the
connecticut
statute
does
not
contain
the
"shall...
unless"
language
the
nebraska
statute,
which
was
at
issue
in
greenholtz.
so
the
real
issue,
i
think,
is
whether
or
not
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
which
contains
such
"shall...
unless"
language
a
state
board
may
by
consistent
practice
over
an
extended
period
of
time
establish
a
practice
rooted
in
the
implementation
of
a
state
statute
which
creates
an
entitlement.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
wizner
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
respond
to
that,
this
court
as
you
well
know,
in
greenholtz
stated
that
in
that
case
the
nebraska
statute
by
its
terms
created
an
entitlement.
whether
or
not
such
language
would
be
necessary
in
future
cases,
the
court
said,
will
have
to
be
decided
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
the
2nd
circuit,
the
circuit
from
which
we
come
with
this
case,
has
already
had
occasion,
several
occasions,
to
consider
greenholtz,
and
has
held
that
in
the
absence
of
any
other
evidence,
if
you
have
a
purely
discretionary
statute
such
as
the
one
we
have
here,
no
entitlement
is
created
and
no
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
is
created.
our
position
is
that
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
has
structured
the
exercise
of
its
own
discretion
that
it
was
given
by
the
legislature,
plenary
discretion
in
the
nature
of
any
other
pardoning
authority,
but
with
respect
to
this
particular
group
of
inmates
it
has
limited
the
exercise
of
its
own
discretion
by
granting
relief
to
almost
all
of
them.
mr.
stephen
wizner
well,
not
really,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
claiming
just
because
they'd
granted
relief
consistently
in
the
past
they
have
to
keep
doing
it.
mr.
stephen
wizner
it
would
be
and
we
think
they
can
do
that.
we
think
that
as
long
as
they
are
granting
relief
to
at
least
75
and
perhaps
90
percent
of
inmates,
permitting
them
to
apply
every
year,
the
testimony
from
the
pardon
board
chairman
was,
we
know
that
they're
looking
at
us
very
closely.
the
board
knows
that
these
applications
are
being
made,
and
establishing
a
very
complex
procedure
for
determining
that
reliable
fact-finding
will
take
place,
a
procedure
which
we
don't
claim
entitlement
to,
incidentally.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
your
honor.
and
that
is
not
our
claim
in
this
court
and
was
not
our
claim
below.
mr.
stephen
wizner
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
not
equally
plausible.
i
think
that
what
we're
claiming
is
that
when
relief
is
granted
this
consistently,
it
implicates
a
liberty
interest
and
creates
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement,
a
claim
of
entitlement
to
have
applications
for
sentence
reduction
on
the
part
of
these
inmates
fairly
considered.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
board
of
pardons
has
painted
itself
into
a
corner
as
justice
rehnquist
suggests
and
obligated
itself
to
grant
pardons
to
life
inmates
into
the
future.
in
fact,
it's
hard
to
understand,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
why
it
is
that
connecticut
is
granting
relief
to
so
many
life
prisoners.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
stephen
wizner
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
do
not
think--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--no.
no,
sir,
we
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
marshall--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--yes,
i
will.
mr.
stephen
wizner
all
right.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
sir.
we,
of
course,
have
to
acknowledge--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--it's
a
reason
for
them.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that
is
a
reason
for
a
court
not
to
grant
rehearing.
that
is
not
a
reason
for
an
administrative--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--yes.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
would
not
be
a
reason
that
would
be
a
meaningful
reason
that
would--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--very
well.
we
think
a
reason
has
to
be
given
which
shows...
admittedly,
the
board
has
very
broad
discretion,
and
can
give
almost
any
reason
it
wishes
other
than
a
constitutionally
impermissible
basis
for
denying
the
pardon.
but
we
think
they
have
to
give
a
reason
which
will
accomplish
several
of
the
objectives
of
the
parole
system
in
connecticut,
of
which
the
sentence
commutation
process
is
a
part.
it
would
have
to
be
a
reason,
if
the
denial
of
the
sentence
commutation
were
based
on
institutional
conduct,
it
would
have
to
be
a
reason
which
would
inform
the
inmate
of
what
he
has
to
do
to
improve
his
conduct
so
that
he
might
be
eligible
the
next
time.
mr.
stephen
wizner
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
already
permits
an
inmate
to
come
back
and
try
to
correct
any
misunderstandings
the
board
may
have.
mr.
stephen
wizner
we
wouldn't
say--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--i
would
say
that
some
mechanism
would
have
to
be
offered
to
the
inmate
to
review
an
erroneously
based
decision,
if
the
board--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--that's
right.
i'm
not
trying
to
hedge.
obviously,
a
statement
of
reasons
opens
a
decision
to
review.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
we
don't
claim
a
right
to
an
attorney.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
white,
we
don't
even
claim
the
procedures
that
are
now
conferred
upon
inmates.
our
position
is
that
those
procedures
express
an
intention
upon
the
board
to
engage
in
reliable
fact
finding
and
a
communication
to
the
inmate
that
meritorious
applications
will
be
fairly
considered
and
will
be
granted,
if
they
deserve
to
be
granted.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right.
they
would
have--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stephen
wizner
justice
brennan,
yes;
in
that
respect
justice
rehnquist
is
correct,
they
have
painted
themselves
into
a
corner.
if
they're
granting
relief...
and
our
position
is
that
it's
not
three-quarters
of
the
cases,
it's
almost
90
percent
of
the
cases...
if
they're
granting
relief
that
consistently,
then
they
have
to
give
a
reason
that
explains
why
it
is
that
they're
denying
it
to
the
few
people
that--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--and
they
would
have
to
deliberate.
the
problem
with
the
way
they
decide
cases
now
is
they
sit
all
day
long
and
hear
60
cases,
one
after
another
after
another,
and
the
testimony
from
the
pardons
board
chairman
was
that
it
was
an
emotionally
exhausting
experience.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
at
7
or
8
in
the
evening--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--that
would
satisfy
us,
if
we
got
a
reason
from
each
member
of
the
board.
we
just
want
reasons.
we
think--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
majority
vote
on
a
single
reason.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes;
yes.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right.
if
each
of
them
gave
a
reason
so
at
least
the
inmate
could
be
informed
why
it
was
that
he
was
singled
out
for
differential
treatment
when
most
other
people
whom
he
thinks
are
similarly
situated
in
the
same
prison
are
receiving
relief.
mr.
stephen
wizner
there
are
five.
mr.
stephen
wizner
he
might
have
been
told
five
different
reasons
and
in
fact
the
kinds
of
reasons
which
the
chairman
testified
did
control
these
decisions
were
at
least
five.
i
can
suggest
some
of
the
reasons
that
are
in
the
record.
mr.
stephen
wizner
if
four
out
of
the
five
members
have
valid
reasons--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--the
issue
is
not
whether
or
not
they're
incorrect.
conceding
as
we
do
that
the
criteria
for
granting
relief
can
be
very
broad
and--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--he
would
have
to
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
correct
that
reason.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes.
in
our
judgment
even
one
member
of
the
five-member
board
cannot
deny
a
pardon
for
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason.
mr.
stephen
wizner
statute;
yes.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
we
think
that
would
be
constitutionally
permissible
and
consistent
with
the
kind
of
traditional
plenary
exercise
of
the
pardon
power
that
was
described
by
the
court
in
schick.
but
that's
not
what's
happening
here.
what's
happening
here
is
an
administrative
agency
constituted
by
the
legislature
receiving
applications,
some
300
a
year,
and
deciding
60
cases
in
each
of
four
cities
and
rendering
decisions
on--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--if
your
honor
please--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--for
constitutional
purposes,
for
the
same
reason
that
judges
are
not
required
to
give
reasons
for
their
sentences
and
juries
are
not
normally
required
to
give
reasons
for
their
verdicts.
we
think
that
the
decisions
by
the
judiciary,
by
the
judicial
department,
are
different
from
these
kinds
of
decisions.
first
of
all,
the
actions
of
juries
are
reviewable
by
the
judge,
as
was
shown
in
one
of
the
cases
decided
this
morning.
actions
by
a
judge
are
reviewable
by
appellate
courts,
some
of
them.
mr.
stephen
wizner
but
not
by
this
court.
and,
incidentally,
the
granted--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--while
some
of
us
might
like
reasons,
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
you're
obligated
to
or
that
we're
entitled
to
them.
but
there
is
a
difference,
if
i
could
point
it
out.
mr.
stephen
wizner
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
would
be
perfectly
within
its
discretion
to
do
that
if
it
weren't
granting
relief
to
almost
every
member
of
our
class.
i
think
that
wouldn't
be
a
sufficient
reason
to--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--mr.
chief
justice
burger,
that
is
not
a
reason.
it
doesn't
explain
anything
to
the
inmate
about
why
he
was
singled
out
as
a
member
of
that
small
group
of
perhaps
ten
percent
of
inmates
who
was
not
granted
relief.
mr.
stephen
wizner
these
are--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--there
is
an
explanation
for
this,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
wizner
and
it's
an
explanation
that
i...
i
puzzled,
as
did
justice
stevens,
about
why
all
of
these
lifers
who
are
after
all,
all
of
them
convicted
of
murder,
why
they
are
getting
relief
so
consistently.
if
one--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--because
they're
the
only
ones
who
are
not
eligible
for
parole
unless
the
pardon
board
grants
them
a
sentence
commutation.
they
are
not
paroled--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--here's
how
a
state
life
sentence
works.
prior
to
the
repeal
of
the
penal
code
in
1971,
lifers
received
a
sentence
of
25
years
to
life.
during
the
first
20
years
of
their
sentence
they
did
not
receive
the
benefit
of
their
good
time,
although
five
years
of
good
time
was
given
to
them
during
the
first
13
years
of
their
sentence.
at
the
point
where
they
reached
20
years,
the
five
years
good
time
was
given
to
them
as
a
lump,
and
they
were
immediately
reduced
to
20
years
and
eligible
for
parole.
by
reducing
the
lifer
sentence
to
20
years
at
same
point
during
the
first
20
years,
the
lifer
gets
the
benefit
of
those
five
years.
that
automatically
reduces
him
to
15
years.
so
that
mr.
gates's
testimony
of
somewhere
between
14
and
17
years
has
quite
a
rational
basis.
what
the
pardon
board
is
doing
in
these
cases
is
saying
that
lifers
should
have
the
benefit,
as
a
rule,
of
good
time
just
as
all
other
inmates
do,
and
the
reason
that
they're
doing
it
is
so
that
lifers
won't
feel
totally
frustrated
that
they
have
no
opportunity
for
ever
getting
released.
mr.
stephen
wizner
to
earn
good
time.
mr.
stephen
wizner
until
they
have
served--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--the
full
20
years.
and
that
is
why,
if
you
look
at--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--that
law
has
been
changed.
since
1971
the
legislature
has
elected
to
give
lifers
minimum
terms,
so
that
some
lifers
have
minimum
terms
as
low
as
ten
years.
with
the
benefit
of
good
time
they
are
eligible
for
parole
after
serving
something
like
two-thirds
of
their
minimum
sentence.
what
the
legislature
did
is
it
acknowledged
that
some
lifers
should
receive
minimum
sentences
lower
and
some
higher.
however,
as
of
july
of
this
year,
the
sentence
is
going
back
to
25
years
to
life.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
connecticut
is
abolishing
parole,
as
of
july
of
this
year.
so
that
the
only
inmates
for
whom
this
decision,
a
decision
in
this
case,
would
have
any
impact,
would
be
this
small
group
of
30
or
fewer
inmates.
mr.
stephen
wizner
or
35.
i'm
sure
it's
not
35
anymore.
it
was
35
in
1975.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
not
the
only
offense,
and
there's
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that...
all
of
our
clients
have
committed
murder,
but
there's
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that
also
provides
for
life
sentences
in
certain
limited
situations
for
persons
who
lie
in
wait
and
pluck
out
the
eyes
of
the
victim
or
do
damage
to
certain
parts
of
their
bodies.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
have
read
opinions
like
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
wizner
o'neill,
i
think,
was
the
example,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
it
would
not,
justice
marshall.
except--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--because
the
legislature
has
made
clear
in
the
case
of
a
man
convicted
and
sent
to
jail
what
it
is
that
has
to
be
found
before
that
can
happen.
the
pardon
board
hasn't
told
us
what
reasons
or
criteria
it
is
applying.
if
the
pardon
board
said--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--there
is
only
the
statute,
the
legislature--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--the
statutes
defining
crimes
define
the
elements
of
the
offenses.
mr.
stephen
wizner
the
reasons
have
to
be
that
the
defendant
has
been
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
each
and
every
element
of
the
offense
prescribed
by
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
it
does
not.
i'm
sorry;
i
misunderstood.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
should
listen
to
your
questions.
mr.
stephen
wizner
the
reason
why
you
must
get
more
is,
first
of
all,
when
the
appellate
court
is
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
trial
court,
it
is
deciding
several
things,
but
above
all
it
is
looking
at
a
conviction
for
a
crime
in
a
criminal
case
where
each
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
has
been
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trier
of
fact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
have
no
criteria
here.
if
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
said,
sentence
commutations
for
persons
serving
life
sentences
under
the
old
penal
law
which
was
repealed
in
1971,
the
following
five
criteria
will
be
considered,
and
then
the
board
can
say,
we
have
considered
all
the
five
criteria
and
we
find
that
he
doesn't
satisfy
them,
that
would
be
enough.
mr.
stephen
wizner
all
of
our
people
were
convicted.
mr.
stephen
wizner
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'm
not
here
asking
for
the
release
of
my
clients.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
am
not
here
asking
for
the
release
of
my
clients,
and
it
may
well
be
that
a
requirement
that
reasons
be
given
will
inhibit
arbitrary
granting
of
relief
as
well
as
arbitrary
denial
of
relief,
and
i
really
don't
know
what
the
consequence
of
it
would
be.
all
i
know
is
that
our
clients,
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
do
not
understand
why
they
were
not
granted
the
same
relief
that
everyone
else
was
granted.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
i
don't,
justice
rehnquist.
the
decision
of
the
jury,
as
this
court
decided
today,
may
be
set
aside
by
a
judge
if
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
support
it.
there
is
no
such
check
on
the
actions
in
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right.
similarly,
we
have
no
such
instructions
from
the
legislature
given
to
the
board
of
pardons.
what
the
legislature
has
told
the
board
of
pardons
of
this
case,
basically,
is
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
to
as
long
as
it's
not
arbitrary.
mr.
stephen
wizner
with
all
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
not
the
practical
effect.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
will
tell
you
why
it
isn't.
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
if
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
were
not
granting
relief
to
almost
90
percent
of
the
members
of
the
class
i
represent.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i'm
not
seeking
release.
i'm
assuming
that
the
board
of
pardons
has
a
reason
for
not
releasing
my
clients.
i'm
just
saying,
tell
them
why.
but
you're
right;
in
that
sense
it's
like
an
order
to
show
cause.
i'm
saying
that
90
percent
of
my
clients
are
getting
it,
ten
percent
are
not
getting
it.
it
rises
to
the
level
of
you
having
to
show
us
why
it
is
that
they're
not
getting
it.
but
then
our
position
is,
almost
any
reason
is
sufficient
so
long
as
it's
a
reason
which
explains
why
they
haven't
gotten
it
and
it's
not
based
on
constitutionally
impermissible
grounds.
mr.
stephen
wizner
but
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
already
permits
that,
sir.
mr.
stephen
wizner
if
the
board
of
pardons
decides
a
case
on
constitutionally
impermissible
grounds.
mr.
stephen
wizner
the
scope
of
review
would
be
like
the
review
of
an
administrative
agency,
very
narrow.
mr.
stephen
wizner
it
could
be
review
by
the
board
of
pardons
itself,
or
judicial
review
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
don't
say
the
constitution
requires
judicial
review.
i
would
say
it
would
require
some
mechanism
for
correcting
constitutionally
impermissible--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--he
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
didn't
happen.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
think
the
board
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
information
it
receives
from
the
prison
authorities,
provided
that
he
had
a
fair
institutional
disciplinary
hearing.
mr.
stephen
wizner
he
is
entitled
to
some
review,
to
a
chance
to
show
that--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--then
he
gets
whatever
the
board
orders
that
he
gets,
either--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--then
he
has
nothing
left.
if
four
other
members
have
given
reasons
why
he
should
be
denied
relief,
then
he
should
be
denied
relief.
and
what
we're
saying
in
this
case,
that
it...
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
correct,
and
that's
what--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--that's
right,
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
stephen
wizner
it
doesn't,
justice
stevens,
although
assuming
it
would
favor
a
rule
which
required
trial
judges
to
give
statements
of
reasons
for
sentences,
the
legislature
in
the
case
of
sentencing
has
created
outer
bounds
for
sentencing.
mr.
stephen
wizner
and
here
we
have
outer
bounds
too,
but
we
have
an
agency
which
has
limited
its
own
bounds,
it
has
structured
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
by
acting
in
a
certain
way
over
and
over
and
over
again.
mr.
stephen
wizner
it
has
to
be
constitutionally
significant,
although
i
agree
with
you
that...
i
don't
know
if
i'm
agreeing
with
you...
i
would
prefer,
obviously,
to
have
judges
give
reasons,
but
i
think
that
when
a
state
agency
and
a
branch
of
the
executive
acts,
it's
different
than
when
a
court
or
a
judge
acts.
if
a
judge
is
acting
within
the
discretion
that
has
been
conferred
upon
him
by
the
legislature
and
is
imposing
a
sentence
within
the
limits
set
by
the
statute
and
if
you
know
what
the
sentence
is
being
imposed
for,
which
is
a
particular
crime
with
particular
elements,
then
i
don't
think
the
judge
is
constitutionally
required
to
give
reasons.
another
reason
is
just
based
on
the
separation
of
powers,
i
would
think.
mr.
stephen
wizner
there
might
well
be
such
a
reason
in
that
case
and
the
analogy
i
think
of,
justice
rehnquist,
is
the
draft
evasion
cases
where
appellate
courts
held
that
where
judges
automatically
sentenced
draft
evaders
to
the
five-year
maximum
sentence
under
the
statute,
the
cases
had
to
be
remanded
to
the
trial
courts
so
that
the
trial
judge
would
exercise
discretion
in
determining
what
sentence
should
be
applied
to
the
particular
offender.
mr.
stephen
wizner
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
it's
a
good
rationale,
though,
i
think,
and
one
that
i
would
urge
upon
the
court.
if
the
trial
judge
consistently
and
systematically
without
considering
the
individual
characteristics
of
offenders
were
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence
for
a
particular
crime,
i
would
think
that
that
kind
of
practice
should
be
subject
to
appellate
review.
i
would
think
that,
perhaps
not
a
statement
of
reasons
but
at
least
a
remand
to
the
trial
court
to
insist
that
discretion
be
exercised
in
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
think
a
sentencing
judge
who
is
engaging
in
the
practice
i
have
just
described
ought
to
be
required
constitutionally
to
give
reasons
for
what
he's
doing.
yes,
your
honor.
fortunately,
that
issue
doesn't
have
to
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
it
did.
it
did
eliminate
judicial
discretion,
substantially.
it
has
done
what
other
states
have
done
in
abolishing
parole,
which
is
to
establish
fixed
sentences
and
inmates
know
exactly
when
they're
going
to
get
out,
less
good
time,
once,
when
those
sentences
are
imposed.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right.
i
mean,
the
legislature
has
spoken
to
that
exact
issue,
and
they
want
to
limit
the
discretion
of
everyone
involved
in
the
sentence-imposing
and
sentence-reduction
process
in
connecticut.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right.
and
they
have
returned
to
25-year
minimum
sentences
for
lifers
commencing
in
july
of
this
year.
the
situation
will
be
somewhat
different,
however,
since
they
won't
be
eligible
for
parole
accelerations
because
there
won't
be
any
parole.
so
we
continue
to
be
faced
only
with
the
problem
of
the
small
group
of
people
whom
we
represent.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
am
not.
i
gather
from
my
reading
that
it
is
a
movement
that
is
afoot
to
abolish
parole
and--
mr.
stephen
wizner
--i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
do
that;
certainly
not.
and
that's
not
what
i'm
after.
in
fact,
what
i'm
after
seems
to
me
to
be
very
little,
although
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
entitlement
to
it
is
of
course
a
major
issue.
what
i'm
after
is
an
explanation
to
the
few
people
who
aren't
getting
the
relief
that
almost
everyone
else
who
committed
the
same
crime
is
getting
about
why
they're
not
getting
it.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
justice
marshall?
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes.
there
is
a
sentence
review
board
in
connecticut
in
which
you
can
have
your
sentence
reviewed
by
a
panel
of
three
judges.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
wizner
no,
i
don't
think
lifers
are
eligible
for
sentence
review.
they
have
a
mandatory
25-year
to
life
sentence,
justice
marshall.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
another
reason
why
the
pardon
board
may
have
been
granting
relief
on
a
higher
percentage
of
cases
of
lifers
than
other
people,
that
they
can't
get
the
benefit
of
their
good
time
and
they
can't
get
their
sentences
reduced
any
other
way.
mr.
stephen
wizner
yes,
it
would.
they
haven't
done
that,
and
i
doubt
that
they
could
do
it
retroactively
to
affect
my
clients,
but
certainly
they
could
do
that.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that
is
not
my
objective,
your
honor,
i
would
not
come
to
court
to
seek
the
elimination
of
discretion
and
the
denial
of
relief
to
clients
whom
i'm
representing.
on
the
other
hand,
i
want
the
court
to
understand
that
our
position
is
that
the
legislature
has
that
discretion.
they
can
do
that
if
they
want
to.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
am
not
opposed
to
that.
it
seems,
if
i
may
address
your
question,
which
is
not
directly
involved
in
our
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
correctional
officials
ought
to
be
applying
fixed
sentences
and
that
there
ought
not
to
be
so
much
discretion
in
the
system,
because
it
creates
the
risk
of
arbitrariness
which
i
think
exists
in
this
case.
if
there
were
a
consistent
set
of
criteria
and
a...
may
i
finish
my
question?
if
there
were
a
consistent
set
of
criteria
being
applied
and
fair
deliberation
being
had
on
each
application
for
parole,
and
there
were
sensitive
consideration
being
given
to
the
rehabilitative
goals
of
the
penal
correctional
process,
it
might
be
different.
but
our
experience
has
been,
both
in
state
and
federal
parole
systems,
that
that
is
not
happening.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
wizner
we
are
not.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
hesitate
to
argue
against
myself,
but
i
do
not
think
so,
justice
powell.
i
think
the
process
that's
due
in
this
situation
is
a
statement
of
reasons.
i
don't
think
that,
in
view
of
the
very
broad
discretion
that
the
legislature
has
given
the
pardon
board
and
the
fact
that
it
is
in
effect
commuting
sentences
validly
imposed,
that
a
full
hearing
is
not
necessary.
however,
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
now
does
give
a
full
hearing
with
a
right
to
counsel,
with
a
right
to
produce
witnesses,
with
a
right
to
examine
the
prison
file,
and
they
even
invite
the
state's
attorney
from
the
county
in
which
the
individual
defendant
has
been
convicted
to
come
and
state
his
view.
and
indeed
one
of
the
grounds
why
pardon,
sentence
commutation
applications
are
denied,
is
when
a
state's
attorney
vehemently
opposes
it
because
of
communications
he
might
have
received
from
the
victim's
family
or
for
other
reasons.
mr.
stephen
wizner
i
think
that's
true,
except
that...
i
hesitate
to
say
that
it's
true,
again
because
of
the
consistency
with
which
relief
has
been
granted.
if
you
have
a
situation
as
we
do
here
where
more
than
three-quarters
and
perhaps
as
many
as
90
percent
of
a
particular
small
defined
class
of
inmates
are
getting
relief,
then
it
may
be
that
they
have
to
have
something
more
than
just
some
superficial
statement
of
reasons
when
they
are
singled
out
for
denial
of
that
relief.
that
is
not
the
system
we
have
now.
the
system
we
have
now
is
that
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
grants
these
kinds
of
hearings
to
anybody
who
applies
to
it,
so
i
have
to
assume
that
i'm
operating
within
a
system
in
which
anybody
after
he's
served
one
year
of
a
sentence
may
apply
for
a
sentence
commutation
and
that
the
board
as
a
matter
of
practice,
deeply
rooted
practice
over
a
period
of
some
three
decades,
has
singled
out
one
class
of
inmates
to
give
a
very
high
level
of
relief
to.
mr.
stephen
wizner
that's
right.
our...
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
what
i'm
saying
about
that,
justice
stevens.
of
persons
convicted
of
murder
or
related
crimes
and
serving
life
sentences
under
a
statute
that
was
repealed
in
1971,
sometime
during
the
first
20
years
of
their
life
sentence
75
to
90
percent
of
them
will
have
their
sentences
reduced
by
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons,
and
that's
all
that
i'm
saying.
