justice
rehnquist
when
you
say,
mr.
o'neill,
the
testimony
was,
what,
75,
85,
90
percent?
it
was
not
straight
across
the
board?
justice
rehnquist
it's
over
75?
mr.
o'neill,
do
you
think
the
president
in
the
case
like
schick
v.
reed
could
be
required
to
give
a
statement
of
his
reasons
for
denying
or
granting
a
pardon?
justice
rehnquist
so
that
it's
in
effect
boxed
itself
in?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
after
this
decision
they
started
not
granting
any
relief
at
all
or
granting
relief
to
20
or
30
percent
rather
than
70
percent,
then
the
case
would
be
wholly
different,
i
take
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wizner,
supposing
that
the
parole
board...
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
and
the
statute
confer
upon
it
unfettered
discretion,
at
least
by
statute.
justice
rehnquist
and
supposing
it
chose
to
operate
in
a
manner
that,
simply,
they
met
once
every
six
months
and
any
member
of
the
board
could
put
an
applicant's
name
on
a
list
to
be
considered,
and
if
the
applicant's
name
wasn't
put
on
the
list
to
be
considered
he
simply
never
would
be
considered.
justice
rehnquist
do
your
defendants
have
that
sort
of
reason-giving
in
the
process
of
finding
their
guilt?
a
jury
comes
in
with
a
general
verdict
of
guilty.
do
you
think
it
has
to
state
a
reason
why
it
found
them
guilty?
justice
rehnquist
supposing,
following
up
on
justice
stevens'
question,
that
a
particular
judge
has
a
reputation
for
being
very
severe
on
narcotics
cases
and
generally
sentences
to
the
maximum
authorized
by
law
in
those
cases,
say
in
90
percent
of
the
cases
that
come
before
him,
but
in
ten
percent
he
doesn't.
now,
do
you
think
that
one,
a
member
of
that
ten
percent
has
a
right
to
go
to
some
court
and
claim,
or
go
to
the
appellate
court
and
claim
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
explanation
from
the
sentencing
judge
as
to
why
he
of
the
ten
percent
was
singled
out,
whereas
90
percent
were
not?
justice
rehnquist
did
this
court
ever
hold
that?
justice
rehnquist
but
how
would
you
know
that
discretion
was
being
exercised
unless
you
had
a
statement
of
reasons.
just
a
remand,
and
then
the
judge
simply
imposes
the
same
sentence
again
without
saying
anything
more?
