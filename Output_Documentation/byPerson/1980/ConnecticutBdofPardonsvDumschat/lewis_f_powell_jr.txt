justice
jr.
if
the
court
should
create
a
liberty
interest,
would
it
not
follow
that
these
inmates
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
well
as
a
statement
of
reasons?
justice
jr.
i
understand
that
the
liberty
interest
you
are
asserting
in
this
case
would
not
even
require
that
the
board
hold
a
meeting.
is
that
correct?
