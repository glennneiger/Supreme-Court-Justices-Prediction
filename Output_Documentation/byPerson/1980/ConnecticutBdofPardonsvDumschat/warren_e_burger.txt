chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
now
in
connecticut
board
of
pardons
v.
dumschat.
mr.
o'neill,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
well,
where
does
the
burden
of
proof
lie?
if
there's
a
problem,
a
man
is
sentenced
for
a
fixed
term,
or
for
life,
who
has
the
burden
of
establishing
a
basis
for
this
extraordinary
relief?
chief
justice
burger
something
like
our
practice
of
not
giving
reasons
for
why
we
deny
certiorari?
chief
justice
burger
but
that's
one
of
the
kinds
of
cases
that
they
might
consider,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
o'neill.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wizner.
chief
justice
burger
didn't
the
greenholtz
opinion
for
the
court
emphasize
the
key
to
it
was
the
language
of
the
nebraska
statute?
chief
justice
burger
what's
that
got
to
do
with
its
practice.
chief
justice
burger
well,
on
the
basis
of
that
argument,
could
not
an
equally
plausible
argument
be
made
that
since
you're
granting
70
percent
in
the
past,
you
must
grant
70
percent
this
year?
i
want
in
on
that
70
percent.
chief
justice
burger
but
isn't
it
equally
plausible?
chief
justice
burger
why
do
you
distinguish
between
an
administrative
body
and
a
judicial
body?
chief
justice
burger
for
constitutional
purposes?
chief
justice
burger
what
about
this
court?
chief
justice
burger
when
we
deny
certiorari,
as
i
suggested
to
your
friend,
you
do
not
suggest
that
we
must
give
a
reason?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
each
of
the
members
of
the
board
filed
a
statement
essentially
saying,
denied
because
the
petitioner
has
presented
no
reason
that
it
should
be
granted?
chief
justice
burger
i
understand.
my
question
is,
suppose
in
every
case
from
now
on
they
gave
that,
"because
no
reason
has
been
advanced
why
the
petition
should
be
granted.
"
isn't
that
a
reason?
chief
justice
burger
from
what
you
have
said
so
far,
mr.
wizner,
i
get
the
impression
that
you're
saying
that
when
a
prisoner
files
the
petition
it
should
be
in
effect
treated
as
an
order
to
show
cause
directed
to
the
board
why,
to
state
why
he
should
not
be
released.
isn't
that
the
practical
effect
of
it?
chief
justice
burger
you
tell
me
why
it
isn't.
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
is
not
the
petition,
doesn't
it
function
as
a
direction
to
the
board,
on
your
submission,
that
you
must
give
me
a
reason
why
you
do
not
release
me,
or
else
release
me?
that's
what
you're
asking
for.
chief
justice
burger
are
you
familiar
with
how
many
states
have
abolished
or
cut
back
their
parole
statutes?
chief
justice
burger
i
am
sure
it
is
not
a
desire
on
your
part
to
see
this
dispensation
that
now
exists
under
the
board
in
connecticut
abolished
too?
that's
not
what
you're
after?
chief
justice
burger
but
that
isn't
your
objective,
you've
indicated
previously?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
are
aware,
i
take
it,
that
the
states
which
have
abolished
parole
have
done
so
because
of
the
difficulties
imposed
by
entitlement
claims
over
the
last
few
years?
chief
justice
burger
but
it's
only
15
or
20
years
ago,
mr.
wizner,
though
not
literally
every
one,
but
almost
every
one
dealing
with
these
problems
thought
the
indeterminate
sentence
was
the
great
wave
of
the
future,
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened.
and
now,
in
a
short
period
of
time,
for
the
very
reasons
you
have
just
suggested
the
indeterminate
sentence
is
now
regarded
180
degrees
differently,
and--
chief
justice
burger
--and
there's
a
move
to
abolish
it
and
make
sentences
fixed.
now,
what
you're
asking
is
that
we
constitutionalize
a
proposition
that's,
really,
no
one
knows
fully
and
understands
fully.
mr.
wizner,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
or
am
i
interrupting
you,
mr.
chief
justice?
no,
no.
you're
not.
you're
not
asking
for
a
hearing,
as
i
understand
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
