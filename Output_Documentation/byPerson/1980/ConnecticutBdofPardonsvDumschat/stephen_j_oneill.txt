mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
has
the
practice
of
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
in
granting
relief
to
inmates
serving
what
we
call
straight
life
sentences
in
connecticut...
that
is,
sentences
with
no
court-imposed
minimum
term...
and
relief
to
the
extent
that
the
minimum
term
set
by
statute
is
reduced,
thereby
accelerating
the
inmates'
eligibility
to
appear
before
the
connecticut
board
of
parole,
giving
inmates
serving
such
sentences
a
due
process
right
to
the
extent
that
the
board
of
pardons
must
give
written
explanations
of
adverse
decisions
when
they
deny
such
relief.
this
is
the
second
occasion
upon
which
we
have
come
to
this
court,
the
parties
in
this
case
have
come
to
this
court
on
the
issue
of
what,
if
any,
kind
of
a
written
statement
is
required
when
the
board
of
pardons
denies
pardon
relief
to
a
so-called
lifer
in
connecticut.
the
first
occasion
followed
a
decision
in
january
of
1979
by
a
panel
of
the
2nd
circuit
which
analogized
pardons
to
parole,
and
held
in
part
that
written
statements
of
reasons
for
denial
of
parole
are
part
of
the
due
process
requirements
surrounding
parole
decisions,
this
holding
was
based
upon
the
expectation
of
inmates
in
regard
to
parole
possibilities
which
lead
to
those
inmates
acquiring
some
liberty
interest
in
the
parole
process.
in
may
of
1979
this
court
decided
greenholtz.
we
had
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
january,
'79,
decision
of
the
2nd
circuit.
in
june
of
1979
this
court
granted
our
petition
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
2nd
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
greenholtz.
the
same
panel
of
the
2nd
circuit,
the
same
three
judges,
reconsidered
the
matter.
parties
briefed
it
by
order
of
the
2nd
circuit
but
there
was
no
oral
argument.
although
concluding
that
the
applicable
connecticut
statute,
section
18-26
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes,
offered
only
the
mere
hope
of
pardon,
that
it
does
not
create
a
legitimate
expectation
of
freedom,
and
hence
does
not
implicate
due
process...
and
in
this
regard
the
panel
concluded
that
section
18-26
contains
neither
a
presumption
in
favor
of
pardon
nor
a
list
of
factors
to
be
considered
by
the
board
of
pardons,
and
in
fact
that
the
statute
gave
the
board
unfettered
discretion.
despite
these
conclusions,
the
court
upon
reconsideration,
affirmed
its
earlier
conclusion,
as
the
consistent
issuance
of
pardons
to
inmates
serving
so-called
straight
life
sentences
in
connecticut
has
given
inmates
serving
such
sentences
a
protected
liberty
interest
in
the
pardons
process.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
the
average
time?
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
the
testimony
on
average
time
came
from
the
same
witness
who
testified
on
the
percentage
of
pardons,
mr.
gates,
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
connecticut
board
of
parole.
his
testimony
was
somewhere
between
14
and
17
years.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
think
the
fairest
statement
of
the
testimony
is
that
it's
somewhat
more
than
75
percent,
i
think
is
the
fairest--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--in
that
sense--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
within
14
to
17
years.
and
that
was
mr.
gates'
approximation.
it
was
not
based
on
any
study
of
his
records
or
the
board
of
pardons'
records.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
well,
following
the...
mr.
gates
is
a
very
knowledgeable
man
and
he
has
been
around
in
the
corrections
area
in
connecticut
for
decades...
following
the
decision
of
the
2nd
circuit
and
before
this
court
granted
certiorari,
we
did
embark
upon
a
process
of
reviewing
the
minutes
of
the
board's
meetings
for
the
past
five
or
six
years,
i
believe,
to
see
if
we
could
put
together
some
kind
of
a
pattern,
but
we
really
didn't
get
all
that
deeply
into
it
when
this
court
granted
certiorari,
and
we
stopped.
one
thing
that
interested
me
in
that
search
is
that
i
don't
know
that
all
inmates
serving
life
sentences
apply
for
pardons.
we
get
frequent
applications
from
the
same
inmate,
but
i
wonder
if
all
inmates
serving
life
sentences
do
in
fact
apply
for
pardon,
really.
but
anyway,
that's
not
in
the
record
up
to
this
point,
your
honor.
following
the
ordering
of
the
filing
of
the
records,
as
the
court
has
indicated,
the
2nd
circuit
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
how
many
years
a
lifer
must
serve
before
the
probability
of
a
pardon
becomes
so
significant
as
to
give
rise
to
a
protected
liberty
interest.
the
finding
or
conclusion
of
the
2nd
circuit
that
the
consistent
issuance
of
pardons...
again,
from
the
facts
in
the
record,
somewhere
around
75
percent...
and
it's
also
referred
to
as
the
regularity
of
their
issuance...
is
again,
as
i
indicated,
based
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
gates.
in
board
of
regents
v.
roth,
relied
upon
by
the
majority
of
this
court
in
greenholtz,
this
court
held
in
part
that
the
fourteenth
amendment's
procedural
protection
of
property
is
the
safeguard
of
the
security
of
interest
that
a
person
has
already
acquired
in
specific
benefits.
it
further
held
that
to
have
a
property
interest
in
a
benefit
a
person
clearly
must
have
more
than
an
abstract
need
or
desire
for
it,
he
must
have
more
than
a
unilateral
expectation
of
it,
he
must
instead
have
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
it.
it
is
a
purpose
of
the
ancient
institution
of
property
to
protect
those
claims
upon
which
people
rely
in
their
daily
lives,
reliance
that
must
not
be
arbitrarily
undermined.
in
the
leis
case,
leis
v.
flynt,
this
court
further
held
that
a
claim
of
entitlement
under
state
law
to
be
enforceable
must
be
derived
from
statute
or
legal
rule
or
through
a
mutually
explicit
understanding.
there
simply
is
no
statute,
legal
rule,
for
a
mutually
explicit
understanding
such
that
lifers
in
connecticut
have
a
protected
or
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
pardon
relief.
in
roth
itself
there
was
at
least
a
suggestion
that
most
of
the
teachers
hired
on
a
yearly
basis
were
in
fact
rehired,
and
yet
that
suggestion
was
not
deemed
significant
enough
to
give
the
teacher
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement,
thus
invoking
due
process.
indeed,
in
greenholtz
itself,
in
the
dissenting
opinions,
there
was
detailed
reference
to
parole
statistics
around
the
country
which
showed,
in
part:
that
the
history
of
new
york
was
that
75
percent
of
persons
eligible
for
parole
were
in
fact
paroled,
and
that
the
figure
went
as
high
as
92
percent
in
other
states
around
the
country;
that
the
figures
nationally
show
that
some
70
percent
of
inmates
released
to
the
community
were
in
fact
released
to
the
community
via
the
parole
process.
and
yet,
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
indeed,
even
other
panels
of
the
2nd
circuit
have
in
pugliese
and
boothe
acknowledged
that
high
percentages
of
parole
releases
do
not
give
somebody
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
i
seem
to
be
the
only
attorney
who
has
lost
this
issue,
at
least
in
the
2nd
circuit.
in
short,
even
if
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
may
be
generous
in
the
exercise
of
its
authorities,
its
record
such
as
it
appears
can
hardly
be
interpreted
as
conveying
the
message
to
an
inmate
serving
a
life
sentence
that
he
has
something
that
he
can
rely
on,
that
he
has
something
that
will
not
be
taken
away
from
him
unless
he
does
something
about
it,
or
unless
certain
conditions
can
be
established,
which
are
the
grounds
upon
which
such
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
must
be
premised.
further,
in
schick
v.
reed,
this
court
dealt
with
the
authority
of
the
united
states
constitution
of
the
president
to
grant
pardons.
in
schick
the
court
characterized
one
who
seeks
a
pardon
as
a
person
who
is
petitioning
for
mercy,
and
held
that
the
president's
pardoning
power
was
plenary,
in
that
it
entailed
the
authority
to
reduce
or
alter
the
sentence
which
conditions
which...
which
themselves
are
constitutionally
unobjectionable.
since
the
pardoning
process
is
plenary,
it
would
seem
to
be
conditioned
only
upon
constitutionally
unobjectionable
reasons.
it
would
seem
that
the
denial
of
the
pardon,
similarly,
is
plenary,
provided
pardons
are
not
denied,
or
pardon
relief
is
not
denied
for
constitutionally
impermissible
reasons.
there
is
really
no
claim
in
this
case
that
inmates
are
denied
pardon
relief
in
connecticut
or
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
denied
pardon
relief
in
connecticut
for
constitutionally
impermissible
reasons.
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
found,
in
the
inmate
context,
which
have
found
a
constitutionally
protected
claim
of
entitlement,
are
really
not
applicable
to
this
case.
in
wolff,
good
time
was
given
to
the
inmate,
by
law,
in
nebraska;
good
time
could
be
deducted
only
for
failure
to
obey
the
rules
of
the
prison.
thus
the
inmate
had
something
that
he
could
count
on,
and
from
my
experience
in
the
department
of
corrections
in
connecticut,
inmates
do
count
on
good
time,
which
should
only
be
taken
from
them
if
they
do
something
wrong.
that's
not
true
of
an
applicant
for
a
pardon.
i
know
that
inmates
when
they
are
sentenced
expect
or
base
their
pleas
or
base
their
defenses,
or
even
base
their
conduct
in
prison,
on
the
expectation
that
they're
going
to
get
pardon
relief.
in
morrissey,
the
inmate
had
a
parole;
he
was
in
the
community;
he
was
with
his
family.
for
all
but
some
minor
restrictions
he
was
a
free
man.
it's
understandable
that
in
morrissey
this
court
held
that
before
those
freedoms
could
be
taken
from
him,
he
was
entitled
to
some
kind
of
a
due
process
hearing.
again,
the
lifer
in
connecticut
has
no
such
reasons
in
terms
of
anticipating
a
pardon.
in
short,
we
claim
that
the
decision
of
the
2nd
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
don't
think
that
any
state
agency
has
the
right
to
be
capricious
and
whimsical.
if
denying
a
pardon
for
no
reason
constitutes
being
capricious,
arbitrary,
then
i
would
say,
no,
i
don't
think
they
have
that
power.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
don't
think
they
deny
or
grant
pardon
for
no
reason,
mr.
justice.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
to
your
question
derives
from
the
concept
of
a
pardon,
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons,
such
as
this
court
indicated
in
schick,
takes
the
position
that
if
a
man
has
been
sentenced,
there's
no
challenge
to
the
sentence,
no
challenge
to
the
conviction.
what
he's
asking
for
is
an
act
of
mercy
to
commute
or
shorten
that
sentence,
and
in
short,
their
approach
is,
show
us
why
we
should
extend
this
act
of
mercy
to
you.
and
when
a
pardon
is
denied,
in
effect
what
the
board
is
saying
is
that
you
haven't
given
us
sufficient
reasons
why
we
should
do
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
as
formal
as
making
a
motion,
mr.
justice
brennan.
what
happens
is
that
when
the
board
breaks,
the
minutes
are
read,
the
names
of
the
inmates
who
appeared
are
read,
and
there
is
a
pause.
and
if
any
member
of
the
board
wishes
to
discuss
stephen
o'neill's
case,
he
says
so.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
that
is
consideration.
this
is
a--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--i
would
claim
that
it
is.
i
mean,
everybody,
the
members
of
the
board
know
that
this
is
the
practice,
and
they
know
that
when
that
name
is
read,
that
that
is
the
time
to
speak
up.
obviously,
if--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--well,
the
reason
would
be,
as
i...
the
real
reason
would
be
that
i
had
not
given
the
board
sufficient
reasons
in
their
mind
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--to
even
consider
giving
me
relief.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
it
has
five
members,
one
of
whom
by
statute
must
be
a
justice
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court.
they
are
appointed
by
the
governor
with
the
approval
of
one
of
the
branches
of
the
connecticut
legislature.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
really
don't
recall.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
there
is
a
turnover.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
each
governor
could
conceivably
have
a
new
board.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
believe,
have
a
brand
new
board.
i've
never
heard
of
a
situation
where
the
incumbents
were
discharged
when
a
new
governor
came
to
office.
never
heard
of--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--well,
again,
one
goes
back
to
the
philosophy
of
the
board.
the
reason
is
that
they
in
effect
are
telling
the
applicant,
show
us
why
we
should
do
this.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
we
don't
claim
to
be
a
court
or
to
have
judicial
powers,
but
it
is
along
those
lines,
your
honor;
yes.
and
as
indicated
in
the
majority
opinion
in
greenholtz,
that
these
are
motions
and
considerations
and
decisions
which
don't
readily
lend
themselves
to
a
statement
of
reasons.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
the
statute
says
nothing
on
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
2nd
circuit
said
the
statute
gives
them
unfettered
discretion.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
well,
you
mean,
just
administratively
decide
that,
absent
constitutional
or
statutory
requirements?
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
requiring
it.
there
certainly
is
no
statutory
requirement
in
connecticut.
i
said,
even
the
2nd
circuit
said
we
have
unfettered
discretion.
administratively,
to
decide,
to
give
reasons
as
an
administrative
policy?
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
there
might
well
not
be.
the
reason
would
again
be
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--all
right.
the
reason
would
be
that
what
the
board
would
be
telling
the
inmate
is,
you
have
not
shown
us
why
we
should
extend
this
act
of
mercy
or
clemency
to
you.
that
is
standard,
however
it
was--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--however
it
was
phrased,
that
would
be
the
message.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
however,
it
was
stated
that
would
be
the
reason.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
for
the
board
of
pardons,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
the
reason
would
simply
be
to
the
inmate,
you
haven't
shown
us
why
we
should
extend
that
act
of
clemency.
what
that
would
accomplish--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--or
how
that
would
help
anybody--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--that
is
the
reason,
that
is
the
thought
process
that
the
board
goes
through.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
well,
he's
testified
that
administratively,
if
one
devised
a
form
with
four
or
five
patented
answers,
it
would
be
no
great
problem
to
check
two
or
three
boxes
on
that
printed
form,
but
i
think
he
also
testified
that
in
his
mind
that
wouldn't
tell
the
inmate
much
of
anything,
and
doesn't
advance
or
promote
any
cause
or
any
justice,
it's
simply
a
pro
forma
useless
act,
that's
what
i
think
he
was
really
saying.
administratively,
we
could
probably
handle
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
in
reducing
the
minimum
term.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
was
that
somewhere
between
14
and
17
years,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
roughly
around
75
percent,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
not,
really.
i
believe
there
is
some
authority
in
the
governor
of
the
state
of
connecticut
to
grant
temporary
reprieves
in
capital
cases,
but
nothing
along
the
lines
of
what
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
there
are
a
multitude
of
attitudes
and
philosophies
and
guidelines
and
goals
that
the
individual
members
of
the
board
use,
some
of
which
are
really
hard
to
define,
as
this
court,
as
a
majority
of
this
court
noted
in
greenholtz.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
well,
one
must
read,
one
must
read
the
legislature's
acts
together.
the
legislature
has
done
both.
the
legislature
has
in
effect
set
a
minimum
sentence
and
at
the
same
time
has
given
the
board
the
authority--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--that
has
happened
and
that
has
been
the
reason.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
that...
there
have...
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
effect;
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
has
been
a
factor.
performance,
need,
many
factors
that
would
go
into
it,
no
one
of
which
in
any
individual
case,
or
in
all
the
cases,
would
be
the
predominant
effect,
and
each
case
is
considered
on
an
individual
basis.
and
it
is
analogous
to
the
thought
process
of
a
judge
in
passing
sentence.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
the
inmate
must
apply.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i
believe
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
know
the
only...
it's
in
the
record
that
the
only
requirement
is
that
he
must
serve
a
year
of
his
sentence
before
he
can
apply.
after
that
he
can
apply--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--yes,
there
are
rules.
they're
not
in
the
record,
but
it
is
well
known
to
the
inmates
at
somers.
the
board
sits
there
four
or
five
times
a
year,
and
it's
well
known.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
that
you
must
apply;
yes,
there
are
written
procedures;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
petition;
yes.
i
believe
there
are
copies
of
the
printed
petitions
in
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
a
form
is
provided.
whether
it's
the
board,
or
the
department
of
corrections,
the
board
for
fiscal
purposes
is
a
part
of
the
connecticut
department
of
corrections.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
i'm
looking
for
a
form
now.
it
provides
for
the
name
of
the
inmate,
his
age,
where
he
was
born,
what
his
crime
was,
where
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced,
has
he
earned
commutation
of
credit
on
his
sentence,
number
of
times
he
has
applied
for
the
sentence,
and
concludes
by
saying
that
he
claims
consideration,
because.
and
then,
on
this
form,
there
is--
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
--no,
but
it
gives
the
inmate
a
large
box
to
state
why
the
board
should
give
him
some
relief.
and
again,
that
is
the
way
the
board
looks
at
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
o'neill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
