justice
stewart
well,
wouldn't
the
question
be,
is
the
board
entitled
to
grant
a
pardon
for
no
reason?
justice
stewart
what
is
this
board?
how
is
it
appointed,
and
how
many
members
does
it
have?
justice
stewart
for
a
term
of
how
long?
justice
stewart
so
there's
some
turnover
on
the
board?
justice
stewart
a
new
governor
can't
have
a
new
board?
or
does
he?
justice
stewart
have
a
brand
new
board?
justice
stewart
well,
there
might
be
five
different
reasons.
i'm
only
asking
for
one.
but
there
might
be
no
one
reason.
there
might
be
no
one
reason.
justice
stewart
and
that
would
be
true
in
every
case?
justice
stewart
well,
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
the
board
to
give
reasons
for
its
failure
to
grant
a
pardon.
justice
stewart
these
are
only
inmates
serving
life
sentences?
justice
stewart
and
why
is
that?
justice
stewart
i'd
be
interested
in
it.
justice
stewart
well,
why
is
the
plaintiff
class
limited
to
those
serving
life
sentences?
justice
stewart
i
thought
that
a
life
sentence
meant
20
years,
if
the
person--
justice
stewart
--to
earn
good
time?
justice
stewart
until
they've
served--
justice
stewart
--twenty
years.
justice
stewart
that
law
has
been
changed,
hasn't
it?
justice
stewart
thirty-five--
justice
stewart
--perhaps
not.
and
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
connecticut
murder
is
the
only
offense
for
which
a
life
sentence
can
be
imposed?
justice
stewart
there's
nobody
in
the
connecticut
prisons
convicted
of--
justice
stewart
but
a
jury's
verdict
of
guilty
is
defined
by
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
instructions
on
the
law
given
to
it.
justice
stewart
upon
a
conviction?
and
these
people
went
through
that?
justice
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
