mr.
joel
hirschhorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
criminal
conviction
in
which
the
only
issue
raised
before
this
court
is
whether
the
defendants
were
denied
their
rights
to
a
fair
trial
and
due
process
of
law
by
virtue
of
the
mere
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom
over
their
objection.
the
appellants
contend
that--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--any
camera
in
which
an
effort
is
made
to
broadcast
or
taperecord
for
later
broadcast
and
still
photographic
equipment.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
the
record
will
reflect
that
portions
of
the
trial
were
televised
over
the
evening
news
in
certain
spots.
a
total
of
two
minutes
and
55
seconds
were
televised
on
the
evening
news
of
selected
portions
of
the
trial.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
the
record
will
not
reflect
the
presence
of
any
still
photographic
camera
present
during
the
proceeding.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellees'
reply
brief
at
page
a36,
you
have
a
picture
of
the
courtroom
in
which
the
circle
with
the
"x"
in
it
reflects
the
presence
of
the
television
camera.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
television
camera
was
present
only
for
jury
selection,
only
for
the
direct
examination
and
portions
of
cross-examination
of
the
state's
main
witness
and
for
the
rendition
of
the
verdict.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
none
whatsoever.
there
was
no
recordation
of
defense
evidence
by
the
television
camera
nor
was
it
even
present
during
presentation
of
defense
evidence.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
it
was
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
motions
were
repeatedly
made
to
sequester
the
jury
and
denied.
the
record
will
reflect
that.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
perhaps
because
i
misperceived
the
issue
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
when
i
argued
it.
this
is
not
a
pretrial
publicity
case
like
gannett.
this
is
not
an
effort
to
close
the
courtroom
like
gannett
in
pretrial
matters.
this
is
not
an
effort,
as
in
richmond
newspapers,
to
close
the
trial.
this
is
not
a
closure
case.
the
defendants
here
do
not
seek
whatsoever
to
limit
the
normal
investigative
and
normal
methods
of
covering
trials
in
progress.
what
is
under
attack
here
is
the
method
by
which
television
claims
it
has
a
right
of
access.
and
we
contend,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
method
is
inherently
prejudicial,
just
as
in
estelle
v.
williams
this
court
concluded
that
it
was
inherently
prejudicial
for
a
state
to
compel
a
prisoner
to
go
to
trial
in
prison
garb
without
any
showing
of
psychological
studies.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
i
concede
that
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
was
correct
in
finding
on
the
record
there
was
no
measurable
prejudice.
the
issue
we
raised
there
and
the
issue
we
raise
here
is
that
human
nature
and
our
understanding
of
human
nature
and
common
sense
tells
us
that
being
on
television
is
different
than
any
other
type
of
public
trial
and
that
although
we
may
not
be
able
to
measure
with
specificity
the
prejudice,
behavioral
scientists
tell
us
that
people
act
differently,
posture
differently,
pose
differently
when
they
know
they're
on
tv.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
we
were
not
permitted
to
introduce
any
evidence.
we
were
never
granted
a
de
novo
hearing
on
this.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
occurred
was,
we
filed
a
motion
to
exclude
cameras
in
the
courtroom
over
the
defendants'
objection.
the
trial
judge
determined
that
he
had
no
discretion;
it
was
mandatory.
he
denied
my
motion,
certified
the
question
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
without
a
hearing
it
was
fully
briefed,
including
psychological
studies.
after
briefing
on
the
certified
question
the
florida
supreme
court
dismissed
the
certified
question
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
dispositive
of
the
issue.
when
we
went
back
to
trial
we
were
then
placed
in
a
posture
where
the
judge
said
he
had
a
mandate,
he
could
not
even
ask
whether
it
was
mandatory
or
discretionary.
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
prejudice
per
se
because
we
were
not
afforded
an
evidentiary
hearing,
nor
do
i
believe
an
evidentiary
hearing
would
have
been
necessary.
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
not
necessary
in
estelle
v.
williams,
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
not
necessary
in
jackson
v.
denno
when
this
court
determined
that
it
is
inherently
prejudicial
to
a
defendant
for
a
jury
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
i
am
saying
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
your
understanding
of
human
nature,
as
you
did
in
tumey,
turner,
estes,
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
because
we
all
know
that
timid
people
become
more
timid,
nervous
people
become
more
nervous,
people
who
are
not
used
to
being
in
a
courtroom
can
only
have
their
anxiety
exacerbated
by
the
presence
of
a
television
camera.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that
that
is
accurate,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
ham
is
the
issue.
i
know
television
will
make
a
cocky
witness
more
cocky.
i
certainly
know
it
will
make
a
timid
witness
more
timid.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
know
that
no
judge
would
not
be
fair
and
impartial
where
he
imposed
a
$12
fine
against
somebody
or
his
portion
of
the
fine
came
to
$12.
but
this
court
in
tumey
said,
that
procedure
is
inherently
prejudicial
because
it
creates
the
possibility,
the
probability
of
a
denial
of
a
fair
and
an
impartial
trial.
human
nature
is
such
that
being
on
television
is
more
important
than
not
being
on
television.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
there's
never
been
a
hearing
on
the
issue.
there's
never
been
a
trial.
there's
never
been
an
adversary
hearing.
when
the
florida
supreme
court
enacted
this
rule
which
made
it
mandatory
and
the
defendant
had
no
consent,
it
did
it
without
the
benefit
of
testimony.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
oh,
yes.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
we
have
a
set
of
state
courts
saying
that
the
public's...
the
method
of
access
is
more
important
in
the
context
of
sunshine
in
the
government
than
individuals'
rights
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
they
said
there
was
nothing
demonstrated
as
applied.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
in
that
sense,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
i
tendered
my
faith
in
the
system,
i
presume,
but
there
was
nothing
to
tender,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
florida
supreme
court
made
it
mandatory--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--no,
and
yes.
i
did
not
make
an
offer
of
proof,
and
the
trial
judge
said,
it
won't
make
any
difference
if
you
do.
the
rule
is
mandatory,
but
i'll
certify
the
question
as
one
of
great
public
import.
let
the
florida
supreme
court
hear
it.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
when
you
review
jackson
v.
denno
and
estelle
v.
williams,
and
rideau
and
turner,
there
were
no
evidentiary
matters
or
psychological
studies.
this
court
held
that
where
the
procedure
employed
is
inherently
prejudicial,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
discuss
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
since
time
began.
human
nature
hasn't
changed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
nor
did
we
have
the
constitution.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
yes,
i
do.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
none.
no
evidence
whatsoever.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
none
whatsoever,
and
in
fact,
in
the
estes
case
the
only
thing
that
was
televised
was
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
and
the
rendition
of
the
verdict.
and
we
suggest
in
this
case
that
this
is
not
a
gag
order
case
and
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
access
case.
the
method
of
gathering
news
is
at
issue
here
because
the
method
is
inherently
prejudicial.
this
court,
for
example,
would
not
hesitate
to
strike
down
any
state
statute
which
said
the
state
has
a
right
to
compel
a
defendant
who
is
a
prisoner
to
appear
in
prison
garb
because,
for
the
same
reason,
appearing
in
prison
garb,
human
nature
tells
the
jurors
there's
something
different.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
no.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
the
camera
is
that
circle
with
the
"x"
in
it.
"electric"
is
so
that
the
cameraman
would
know
where
to
plug
his
cord
in.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
yes.
right
behind
the
bar.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
the
jury
box
is
right
next
to
it,
and--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--the
record
will
reflect
that
during
jury
selection
i
asked
every...
not
all,
but
most
jurors
whether
being
on
television
would
in
one
way
or
another
affect--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--oh,
yes,
and
the
record
will
so
reflect.
i
think
in
one
of
my
questions
that's
in
my
appendix
to
my
original
brief,
i
point
out
the
question,
"you
see
the
camera
over
there?
"
and
a
little
later
on,
during
mr.
sion's
testimony
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
in
an
aside,
"your
honor,
i
want
the
record
to
reflect
that
cameras
are
present.
"
and
the
judge
quickly
corrected
me
that
it
was
"a
camera",
the
same
camera.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
that
is
correct.
and
unlike
richmond
newspapers,
where
the
prosecution
and
defense
stipulated
and
the
judge
granted
the
stipulation,
there
was
no
discretion
whatsoever.
the
judge
had
to
do
it--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--no.
that
would
be
asking
for
too
much.
i
think
that--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--yes.
in
richmond,
if
you'll
permit
me
to
explain
my
answer,
in
richmond
this
court
said
that
closure
places
a
very
high
burden
on
the
defendant
in
an
effort
to
protect
the
first
amendment
and
the
public
right
to
know.
down
the
scale
a
little
bit,
you
said
in
gannett,
"pretrial
closure
places
a
high
burden
on
the
defendant;
we
need
to
protect
the
sixth
amendment,
the
defendant's
personal
right.
"
we
say
that
where
a
defendant
objects
to
the
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom,
his
objection
is
sufficient...
if
a
witness...
because
the
method
of
gathering
news
is
inherently
prejudicial...
if
a
witness
or
a
juror
objects,
then
the
judge...
the
per
se
rule
is
where
the
defendant
objects.
if
a
witness
or
a
juror
objects,
or
a
lawyer
objects,
then
the
judge
has
to
do
the
balancing
test.
which
is
more
important
at
this
point,
the
witness
or
juror's
right
of
privacy,
if
there
is
one
in
a
courtroom,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is,
against
the
media's
method
of
gathering
news
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
and
in
fact,
in
fact
there
are
cases
that,
obviously,
it's
been
used
as
a
tool
where
a
defendant
has
demanded
that
a
camera
come
in
the
courtroom
because
he
wanted
to
embarrass
and
humiliate
the
victim
who
was
going
to
be
testifying
against
him
and
the
judges
have
exercised
their
discretion
properly
under
the
theory
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
absolute,
nor
is
the
first.
the
sixth
amendment
yields
to
confidential
informers,
trade
secrets,
unruly
people,
embarrassment,
richmond.
the
first
amendment
yields
to
zurcher,
yields
to
branzburg,
yields
to
libel
and
obscenity,
yields
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine,
yields
to
zemel,
yields
to
saxbe.
the
first
amendment
has
to
yield
too.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
state
did
not
opt.
the
florida
supreme
court
enacted
a
rule
without
the
consent
of
the
governed.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
mr.
rehnquist,
your
views
on
state's
rights
are
well
known
to
me.
i
have
read
and
reread
your
dissent,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
state
under
state's
rights
could
not
enact
a
rule
that
said,
chandler,
if
you're
a
convicted
felon
or
in
prison,
you
appear
in
trial
wearing
dade
county
jail
on
your
t-shirt,
because
that
is
inherently
prejudicial.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
and
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom,
which
is
an
unnecessary
method
of
gathering
news,
violates
the
sixth
amendment
for
the
simple
reason
that
devitt
and
blackmar,
they
are
the
landmark
when
it
comes
to
standard
jury
instructions,
they...
every
trial,
federal
and
state,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
case
the
jury
is
instructed,
you,
the
jury,
are
the
sole
judges
of
the
credibility
and
believability
of
the
witnesses.
you,
the
jury,
shall
determine
the
demeanor
of
the
witness
and
the
witness's
ability
to
know
and
remember
the
facts
about
which
he
testifies.
how
do
we
know
that
the
witness
is
sweating
because
on
cross-examination
the
defense
attorney
finally
hit
a
nerve
center
that
causes
the
witness
to
wonder
whether
he's
going
to
recant,
or
is
he
sweating
because
of
the
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom?
we
don't
know
that.
but
we
certainly
know,
we
certainly
know
that
the
greater
the
exposure...
and
behavioral
scientists
have
told
us,
and
we
know...
that
as
in
brown
v.
board
of
education
and
the
brandeis
brief
that
was
filed,
that
behavioral
scientists
tell
us
what
human
nature
and
common
sense
tells
us.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
that's
what
the
dissenters
in
estes
left
open.
that
day
has
come,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
harlan
and
those
who
joined
were
reluctant
to
close
the
doors
on
the
grounds
that
we
need
this
novel
form
of
experimentation
to
see.
well,
we've
had
this
novel
form
of
experimentation,
an
experiment
without
direction,
an
experiment
without
guidance,
an
experiment
without
controls.
and
i
don't
think
anybody
on
this
bench
can
stand
here
and
say,
when
23
percent
of
the
jurors
or
30
percent
of
the
witnesses
who
finally
responded
to
questionnaires
which
were
subjective
in
and
of
themselves,
admitted
an
awareness
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom.
that's
infecting
the
process
by
its
very
method.
that
gets
right
down
to
the
whole
purpose
behind
due
process
of
law.
that
gets
us
back
to
in
re:
murchison.
that
gets
us
back
to
why
having
a
bailiff
who
is
also
a
deputy
sheriff
and
a
witness,
but
who
swears
he
didn't
say
anything
to
the
jurors,
in
turner
v.
louisiana?
why
this
court
didn't
hesitate
to
strike
that
down
as
being
an
inherently
prejudicial
aspect
of
a
denial
of
due
process
is--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--ten.
i'm
sorry;
there
are
27
states
that
currently
permit
televising,
including
maryland.
however,
ten
require
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
let's
see.
ten
do
not
require
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
there
are
seventeen
in
addition
who
do
require
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
that's
correct.
i
absolutely
would
not
be
here
because
of
the
waiver
principles.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
page
779
of
the
post-newsweek
decision,
the
last...
there's
a
paragraph
that
says,
"the
presiding
judge
may
exclude
the
electronic
media
coverage
of
a
particular
participant
only
upon
a
showing
that
such
coverage
will
have
a
substantial
effect
upon
a
particular
individual
which
would
be
qualitatively
different
from
the
effect
on
members
of
the
public
in
general,
and
such
effect
will
be
qualitatively
different
from
coverage
by
other
types
of
media.
"
however,
two
things
occur.
one
is,
it
doesn't
preclude
coverage
of
the
trial
but
just
coverage
of
that
particular
witness.
and
two,
despite
what
that
says,
i
don't
know
how
a
judge
is
going
to
apply
it.
i
don't
understand,
and
i
don't
think
the
bench
and
the
bar
and
i
don't
think
witnesses
will
know
how
to
demonstrate
the
qualitative
difference.
and
what
that
does
is
invite
mini-trials
during
trials
on
qualitative
difference.
do
we
really
have
to
have
a
behavioral
scientist
tell
us
that
when
a
juvenile
or
a
woman
is
victimized
by
a
sexual
assault,
she
doesn't
need
to
testify
in
front
of
a
television
camera
to
further
and
deepen
her
humility?
do
we
need
evidence
in
the
record
of
that?
i
suggest
not.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
the
record
doesn't
have
to.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
tells
us.
it's
the
first
amendment.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
be
flip,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
can't...
this
court
has
held
in
cox
broadcasting
and
tornillo
that
we
can't
compel...
not
even
this
court
can
compel--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--that's
quite
correct.
the
media
selects
what
it
wants
to
televise,
just
like
it
selects
what
it
wants
to
put
in
the
newspapers.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
well,
this
record
won't
tell,
because
i
was
busy
trying
the
case.
and
i
have
to
presume
from
the
clips
i
saw
on
the
evening
news
that
they
focused
on
mr.
sion,
the
state's
main
witness,
giving
his
key
testimony.
and
they
focused
on
jurors
giving
responses
and
they
focused--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--it's
a
fixed
camera
on
a
tripod
swivel,
but
i
think
they
use
a
zoom
lens
so
they
don't
move
the
camera
per
se.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
i
mean,
i
must
say,
i
must
confess
that
i--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--yes.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
because,
not
in
the
sense
of
what
the
public
sees
but
the
fact
that
the
jury
knows
that
the
camera's
present
just
for
that
portion
of
the
state's
direct
examination,
but
is
not
present
for
any
portion
of
cross
or
the
defendant's
case.
and
i
suggest
that
behavioral
scientists,
common
sense,
and
human
nature
tell
us
that
if
a
television
camera
picks
up
one
part
of
a
trial
but
not
another,
it's
because
someone
has
made
a
judgment
that
that
part
is
more
important
than
the
other.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
oh,
yes,
it
does,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
of
course.
i
was
trying
to
draw
that
distinction.
i
don't
care
what
the
public
sees
in
terms
of
the
defendant's
rights.
it's
what
the
jurors--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--the
jury
was
not
sequestered.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
that
is
the
only
aspect.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
that
is
the
only
aspect.
the
marshal
has
advised
me
i
have
about
six
minutes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
that
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
being
around
television
and
watching
television
is
different
than
being
on
television.
i
don't
care
how
many
television
sets
are
in
a
person's
home
or
how
many
hours
a
day
my
children
watch
tv,
when
that
witness
sits
down
and
that
camera's
present,
he
sees
it.
in
zamora
there
was
no
objection
to
the
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom.
zamora
was
a
peculiar
case
because
the
defense
in
that
case
was
that
cameras
made
the
defendant
insane
and
the
defendant
invited
cameras
in
the
courtroom.
so
zamora
doesn't
apply.
but
zamora's
co-defendant
is
here,
your
honors.
agrella
is
here
on
cert
which
this
court
has
been
holding,
unless
it
did
something
with
it
this
past
week.
agrella
was
a
separate
co-defendant
who
said,
because
his
co-defendant
didn't
object,
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial.
that's
a
collateral
matter
that
has
to
be
addressed.
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
if
every
person
in
yankee
stadium
sat
stonily
silent,
it's
not
the
same
as
the
decorum
and
the
atmosphere
of
a
courtroom.
showing
two
minutes
and
55
seconds,
showing
filmed
highlights,
is
what
precipitated,
i
suggest,
and
it
has
been
argued
in
the
brief,
the
disaster
in
miami
in
the
wake
of
what
we
call
the
mcduffie
verdict.
in
haec
verba,
the
due
process
clause,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
suggest
to
you
prohibits
the
state
of
florida
from
doing
this,
and
i
suggest
that
the
declaration
of
independence,
july
4,
1776,
requires
the
consent
of
the
governed.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
just
its
history.
i
agree.
the
hypothetical
quiet
title
case?
if
a
television
camera
plunked
its
equipment...
and
that's
what
we're
seeking
to
exclude,
equipment
in
a
courtroom...
that
quiet
title
case
would
become
the
most
important
quiet
title
case
ever,
because
some
tv
producer
had
nothing
else
to
do
that
night
and
decided
to
show
that.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
not
necessarily.
because
of
the
jury's
impact.
perhaps
this
witness
was
not
affected,
somehow.
but
to
the
jury
sitting
back
there
in
their
jury
room,
they
can
be
thinking
and
we
can
assume
that
they
are
correctly
thinking
about
which
witness's
testimony
was
more
important
or
more
relevant.
and
i
think
they
can
say--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--oh,
yes.
they
know
which--
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
--the
problem
is...
and
i
now
understand
the
question...
the
camera
wasn't
present
the
whole
time.
i
apologize,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
i'm
sorry.
the
camera
was
only
present
during
jury
selection,
and
the
camera
was
only
present
during
mr.
sion's
testimony.
the
camera
was
not
present
during
other
witness,
during
defense
testimony,
during
closing
argument.
palm
beach
newspapers...
i
urge
the
court
to
read
palm
beach
newspapers;
that
was
cited
by
my
opponent.
because
judge
scholts
said
that
the
state
attorneys
who
labor
every
day
with
witnesses,
that
state
attorney
filed
two
affidavits
saying
he
got
two
witnesses
who
don't
want
to
testify.
they're
in
fear,
they're
in
concern
of
their
life.
judge
scholts
excluded
the
cameras,
not
from
the
trial,
but
from
televising
those
two
witnesses;
not
from
the
trial.
because
the
rule
does
not
permit
blanket
non-televising
of
the
trial,
just
the
successfully
objecting
participant.
and
on
appeal,
the
4th
district
court
of
appeal
said,
mr.
trial
judge,
an
affidavit's
not
enough
because
the
media
has
to
be
given
a
chance
to
confront,
cross-examine
the
affidavit.
that's
an
insufficient
showing,
just
because
two
people
claim
that
they
believe
they're
going
to
get
murdered
if
they
testify
against
the
defendant.
why
the
state
would
want
to
have
this
kind
of
procedure
which
infects
its
own
witnesses?
it's
not
easy
for
the
state
to
get
witnesses
into
court.
people
don't
want
to
have
their
lives
disrupted,
and
yet
they
persist.
the
frailties
of
human
nature
are
such
that
devitt
and
blackmar
zeroed
in
in
the
standard
jury
instructions
on
why
the
jury
has
this
sole
and
exclusive
province
to
evaluate
the
witness's
testimony.
the
first
amendment
has
yielded
in
zurcher
to
the
search
warrant.
the
first
amendment
has
yielded
in
branzburg
to
the
grand
jury.
there
is
no
battle
here.
it
is
just
an
effort
to
preserve
the
very
nerve
center
of
the
factfinding
process,
the
life-blood
of
the
system,
the
defendants'
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
both
the
first
and
the
sixth
amendment
rights
can
be
observed
without
violence
to
either.
there
is
no
harm
whatsoever
if
other
traditional
methods
of
gathering
news,
which
were
in
effect
when
the
constitution
was
written,
are
used.
mr.
joel
hirschhorn
no,
i
distinguish
it--
