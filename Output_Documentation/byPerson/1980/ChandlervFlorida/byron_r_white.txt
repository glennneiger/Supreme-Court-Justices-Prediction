justice
white
and
so
we
have
a
set
of
state
courts
saying
that
your
submission
is
erroneous?
justice
white
you
mean,
did
the
florida
courts
say
that,
yes,
there
is
some
inherent
prejudice
to
the
defendant?
they
said
there
was
none,
didn't
they?
justice
white
so
we'd
have
a
set
of
findings
against
you?
justice
white
mr.
hirschhorn,
i
would
almost
conclude
from
your
submission
that
you
would
urge
that
neither
the
defendant
nor
the
prosecution,
together,
could
stipulate
to
have
cameras
in
the
room?
justice
white
do
you
think
there
just
ought
to
be
a
flat
rule
excluding
them,
no
matter
whether
there's
any
objection
by
anybody
or
not?
justice
white
well,
who
could...
whose
objection
must
be
waived
before
cameras
can
be...
just
the
defendant?
justice
white
you
wouldn't
say
the
defendant
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
you
were
just
describing
would
have
any
special
right
to
demand
that
television
be
admitted?
justice
white
how
many
states
have
taken
florida's
course?
justice
white
of
the
defendant.
so
there
are...
18?
justice
white
so,
if
you
were
in
one
of
those
17
states
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
white
but
the
camera
can
swivel
around?
justice
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
unless
estes
is
overturned,
wouldn't
your
rule
be
invalid
in
a
rather
large
category
of
cases?
justice
white
such
as
the
zamora
case?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
i
know,
but
i
just
asked
you
about
the
category
of
trial
such
as
justice
harlan
described
in
his
opinion
in
that
case.
he
thought
there
was
a
type
of
trial
in
which
television
would
be
per
se
prejudicial.
justice
white
now,
in
that
category
of
trial,
wouldn't
your
rule
be
invalid
in
at
least
some
cases
under
estes?
justice
white
that
isn't
justice
harlan's
holding,
is
it?
no,
not
at
all.
that
isn't
what
he
held.
that
isn't
what
his
opinion
said,
and
it
certainly
isn't
what
the
other
four
justices
in
the
majority
said.
justice
white
he
said,
however,
in
the
notorious
trial
there
was
a
per
se
rule
without
the
necessity
of
demonstrating
any
particular
prejudice.
justice
white
what
about
the
zamora
case?
justice
white
do
you
think
justice
harlan
would
have
thought
that
the
zamora
case
fell
within
his
definition
of
a
notorious
trial?
