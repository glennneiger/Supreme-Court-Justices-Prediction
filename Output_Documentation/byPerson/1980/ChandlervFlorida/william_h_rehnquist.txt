justice
rehnquist
was
the
jury
sequestered?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
florida
found
against
you
on
your
claim
of
prejudice
from
the
pretrial
publicity?
justice
rehnquist
then
you
accept
the
finding
of
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
that
there
was
no
prejudice
in
fact
in
this
case?
justice
rehnquist
was
this
kind
of
evidence
introduced
in
your
record
at
some
point?
justice
rehnquist
did
you
tender
such
evidence?
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
in
effect
that
we
as
presumably
not
behavioral
psychologists
but
as
lay
people
in
that
field
can
determine
on
our
own
whether
it's
inherently
prejudicial
that
something
be
done?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
we
know
that
without
some
sort
of
findings
of
fact
or
conclusions
of
law?
justice
rehnquist
but
how
do
we
know
here
that
it
was
inherently
prejudicial?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
this
case
is
in
quite
a
different
posture
from
either
de
pasquale
or
richmond
newspapers,
in
that
the
state
has
opted
for
television
coverage.
in
those
two
cases
the
state
opted
against
coverage.
you
make
it
sound
as
if
the
constitution
covers
the
entire
100
percent
of
the
spectrum,
without
any
state
latitude.
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
state,
for
our
purposes,
when
the
florida
supreme
court
opts
it
for
a
rule.
justice
rehnquist
because
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
do
you
suppose
this
court
would
give
very
serious
consideration
to
the
claim
of
a
lawyer
who
said
he
was
used
to
practicing
in
a
courtroom
that
only
seated
20
people,
and
was
now
trying
a
case
that
seated
300
people,
that
he
just
wasn't
used
to
practicing
before
a
large
crowd
and
therefore
all
but
20
should
be
excluded?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
provision
in
the
constitution
that
forbids
a
state
from
adopting
a
procedure
that
has
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice,
in
haec
verba?
not
in
haec
verba,
but
your
friend
suggested
one
about
the
defendant
in
prison
garb,
didn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
no
part
of
the
constitution.
