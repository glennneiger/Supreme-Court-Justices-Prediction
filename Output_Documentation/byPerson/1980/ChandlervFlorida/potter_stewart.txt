justice
stewart
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant's
rights,
though,
does
it?
justice
stewart
what
the
public
sees
is
no
part
of
this
case.
justice
stewart
the
jury
was
not
sequestered
here,
was
it?
justice
stewart
that's
all
that
was
actually
an
issue
in
the
court's
judgment,
and
the
court,
as
a
court,
not
a
plurality
but
a
court,
five
people
reversed
the
conviction
in
the
case
because
of
the
presence
of
television
at
the
trial,
per
se.
justice
stewart
so
why
isn't
my
brother
stevens
exactly
correct
in
his
question?
justice
stewart
or
to
an
estes
case?
justice
stewart
well,
isn't
that
almost
self-defining?
wouldn't
any
trial
which
television
was
interested
in
covering
be
by
definition
a
notorious
or
sensational
trial?
justice
stewart
in
any
event,
mr.
attorney
general,
we
don't
need
to,
and
we
mustn't,
decide
whether
or
not
this
is
a
good
idea.
but
the
question
is
whether
what
florida
has
done
is
constitutionally
permissible.
