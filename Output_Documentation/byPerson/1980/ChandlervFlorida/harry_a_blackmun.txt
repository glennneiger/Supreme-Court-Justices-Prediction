justice
blackmun
does
the
record
show
that
the
trial
was
televised
either
live
or
taped?
justice
blackmun
how
about
still
photographs?
justice
blackmun
you're
also
saying,
really,
i
think,
that
there's
a
bit
of
ham
in
all
of
us,
including
jurists.
justice
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
the
effect
one
way
or
the
other
that
when
television
is
present
a
larger
venire
is
needed?
justice
blackmun
is
that
the
way
you
distinguish
the
written
word
from
the
television
picture?
justice
blackmun
that
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
written?
i
distinguish
it
by
that
old
chinese
proverb's
description,
a
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words.
one
political
cartoon
can
wreak
more
damage
than
a
thousand
words.
hundreds
of
feet
on
tv
can
do
even
more.
