justice
marshall
well,
we
didn't
have
television--
--you
mean,
when
time
began.
justice
marshall
yes,
i
know.
mr.
hirschhorn,
do
you
rely
on
the
estes
case
at
all?
justice
marshall
well,
do
the
florida
rules
apply
to
all
trials?
justice
marshall
would
it
apply
to
a
drunken
driving
case?
justice
marshall
would
it
apply
to
a
drunken
driving
case?
justice
marshall
and
would
it
apply
to
a
misdemeanor
case?
justice
marshall
it
would
apply
to
a
spitting-on-the-sidewalk
case?
justice
marshall
that's
about
the
only
way
you
can
get
a
public
trial
in
new
york,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
that's
about
the
only
way
you
could
get
a
"public"
trial
in
new
york,
would
be
a
building
twice
the
size
of
yankee
stadium.
how
do
you
differentiate
this
from
yankee
stadium?
i
suppose
the
audience
is
even
larger
here.
justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
let
me
get
back
to
a
point.
you
said
that
they'd
be
interested
in
covering
every
trial.
what
would
they
do
in
los
angeles
where
they
have
200-and-some
courts?
justice
marshall
well,
it
obviously
can't
be.
