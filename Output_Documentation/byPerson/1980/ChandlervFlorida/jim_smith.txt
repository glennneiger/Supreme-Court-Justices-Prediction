mr.
jim
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
1965
estes
opinion
justice
harlan,
which
was
the
swing
vote
in
the
plurality
decision
in
that
case,
echoed
the
underlying
philosophy
and
restricted
scope
of
justice
clark's
opinion
when
he
said,
and
i
quote
from
that
opinion
briefly,
"finally,
we
should
not
be
deterred
from
making
the
constitutional
judgment
which
this
case
demands
by
the
prospect
that
the
day
may
come
when
television
will
have
become
so
commonplace
an
affair
in
the
daily
life
of
the
average
person
as
to
dissipate
all
reasonable
likelihood
that
its
use
in
courtrooms
may
disparage
the
judicial
process.
"
"if
and
when
that
day
arrives,
the
constitutional
judgment
called
for
now
would
of
course
be
subject
to
reexamination.
"
mr.
jim
smith
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
really
don't
think
that
that
issue
would
ever
be
heard
by
this
court.
it
wouldn't
rise
to
this
level.
certainly,
he
would
be
expected
to
perform
as
an
attorney
in
that
courtroom
whether
there
was
one
spectator
or
300.
mr.
jim
smith
this
court
would
not
accommodate--
mr.
jim
smith
--no,
sir.
this
court,
obviously,
wouldn't
accommodate--
mr.
jim
smith
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
jim
smith
the
courtroom
size
will
accommodate
the
number
of
people
that
the
particular
courtroom
designated
can
take.
mr.
jim
smith
certainly,
and
the
presence
of
the
media
in
the
courtroom
and
your
recent
judgment
in
the
richmond
case
recognized
the
surrogate
responsibility
that
the
media
has
and
the
function
that
they
perform
in
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
public
any
kind
of
trial
that
is
newsworthy.
mr.
jim
smith
the
experience
that
we
have
had
to
date
in
florida,
and
we
have
certainly
had
our
share
of
highly
sensational
publicized
trials,
has
been
that
the
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom
has
indeed
improved
that
process.
the
fact
is,
in
the
zamora
trial,
which
was
a
very
sensational,
highly
publicized
capital
case,
was
televised
gavel-to-gavel
in
florida,
and
portions
of
that
trial
were
shown
worldwide.
the
experience
in
that
proceeding
was
that
for
the
most
part
the
media
was
down
the
hall
or
downstairs
in
a
room
watching
the
proceedings
on
the
tv
monitor,
rather
than
going
back
and
forth
in
the
courtroom
carrying
messages
to
each
other.
the
bundy
trial--
mr.
jim
smith
--mr.
justice
white--
mr.
jim
smith
--we
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
overturn
the
estes
opinion
to
uphold
the
florida
supreme
court
rule.
mr.
jim
smith
the
estes
opinion
did
not
say
that
television
cameras
per
se
were
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jim
smith
i
would
not--
mr.
jim
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
the
case
could
certainly
come
back
before
this
court,
where
a
trial
judge
did
not
exercise
the
proper
control
of
the
proceedings
and
let
it--
mr.
jim
smith
--justice
harlan
said
that
obviously
he
was
not
willing
to
go
along
with
the
four
other
justices
and
on
a
per
se
basis
deny
states
the
right.
mr.
jim
smith
my
reading
of
that
opinion
is
he
said,
a
sensational
trial
in
1962
under
the
facts
in
the
estes
case.
mr.
jim
smith
no,
your
honor,
the
experience
in
florida
is
that
every
news
station
in
our
state
has
a
courthouse
beat
and
it
is
common
in
the
tv
news
programs
and
in
the
newspapers
in
florida
that
what
is
going
on
at
the
courthouse
is
reported.
mr.
jim
smith
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jim
smith
i
do
not,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like...
judge
baker,
who
was
the
trial
judge
in
that
case,
at
the
request
of
the
florida
supreme
court
made
a
very
detailed
report
of
that
proceeding,
which
was
conducted
during
the
experiment
period
of
the
florida
rule,
and
distinguished
what
took
place
at
that
trial
from
the
estes
opinion.
a
full
report
of
judge
baker
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
but
i
could
point
out,
if
i
may,
some
of
his
conclusions.
mr.
jim
smith
no,
sir,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
the
media
covers
every
trial.
i
only...
the
major
newspapers
in
our
state
and
tv
stations
have
reporters
on
the
courthouse
beat,
and
that
normally
in
the
news
segment
there
will
be
a
minute
or
so
every
night
for
what
is
happening
at
the
courthouse.
it
will
not
be
every
case.
mr.
jim
smith
absolutely.
it
would
not
be
every
case.
mr.
jim
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
in
particularly
a
sensational
type
trial,
the
media
will
cover
that
event,
it
will
be
reported
on
television--
mr.
jim
smith
--i
submit
that
it
is
better
for
the
citizens
of
our
state
in
those
situations
to
see
the
actual
image
and
hear
those
portions
of
the
testimony
as
it
has
happened,
rather
that
have
to
depend
on
the
interpretation
that
a
news
commentator
might
like
to
give
it.
mr.
jim
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
that
certainly
is
a
possibility,
but
that
possibility
exists
and
does
happen
whether
cameras
are
present
in
the
courtroom
or
not.
mr.
jim
smith
that's
correct.
whether
or
not
there
is
inherent
prejudice
would
rather
put
in
their
presence--
mr.
jim
smith
--that's
certainly--
mr.
jim
smith
--he
did.
and
i
don't
like
to
be
referee
in
what
may
be
a
disagreement
between
the
honorable
chief
justice
and
justice
rehnquist...
the
constitution
in
the
sense
of
the
administration
of
justice,
you
know,
within
a
state
and
what
kind
of
rules
a
supreme
court
may
adopt
for
that
state,
a
state
supreme
court
so
long
as
they
don't
rise
to
a
federal
constitutional
violation
would
have
discretion
to
adopt
whatever
rules
they
might
deem
proper.
the
florida
rule
authorizing
the
presence
of
the
electronic
media
in
the
courtroom
does
that
well
within
constitutional
bounds
and
well
within
the
encouragement
this
court
has
given
states
to
experiment
with
novel
ideas.
the
experiment
has
proved
successful
in
florida.
we
have
had
literally
hundreds
of
trials
where
the
cameras
have
been
present
in
the
courtroom,
reported
generally
very
few
situations
where
there's
been
an
objection.
and
i
submit
the
big
reason
for
that
is
the
government
sunshine
policies
that
we
have
in
our
state,
the
fact
that
in
our
state,
when
our
citizens
go
to
a
county
commission
meeting
or
a
city
commission
meeting,
even
our
clemency
meetings
in
capital
cases,
they
see
the
television
camera;
the
camera
is
present
at
all
of
those
proceedings.
so
it
is
not
in
any
way
a
novel
experience
for
the
citizens
of
our
state
to
be
around
television
equipment.
it
has
become
commonplace
in
florida,
as
the
presence
of
cameras
and
television
obviously
have
become
commonplace
in
our
daily
lives.
the
most
recent
roper
report
tells
us
there
are
more
than
90
million
tv
sets
in
this
country,
that
that
television
in
the
average
household
is
on
some
6-1/2
hours
a
day.
if
i
could
comment
briefly
on
the
experience
in
the
zamora
trial
which
was
a
highly
publicized
trial,
as
i
say,
in
this
country
and
worldwide.
judge
baker
took
note
of
justice
clark's
concern
about
the
red
light
on
the
camera.
obviously
the
state
of
art
in
cameras
has
changed.
we
don't
have
lights
on
the
cameras
in
our
courtrooms
that
indicate
when
they're
on
or
off,
and
there
is
only
one
camera
in
the
courtroom.
another
concern
in
the
estes
case
was
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
had
to
hold
no
less
than
five
hearings
about
the
pre-trial
coverage
to
referee
disputes
between
the
media.
under
the
florida
rule
the
pooling
arrangement
as
to
who
will
operate
the
one
camera
that
is
present
in
the
courtroom,
those
decisions
are
worked
out
among
the
media
themselves.
the
court
is
not
called
upon
to
referee
any
disputes.
if
there
are
disputes
in
that
regard,
then
cameras
are
not
present
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
jim
smith
that
has
not...
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that,
your
honor.
some
28
states
have
experimented
with
cameras
being
present
in
their
courtrooms.
in
eight
states
those
proceedings
may
be
televised
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
in
three
states
appellate
proceedings
are
televised
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant's
lawyer
in
that
case.
in
the
remaining
states,
some
16,
television
coverage
is
allowed
with
the
defendant's
consent.
states
have
experimented
in
this
area
successfully.
we
urge
this
court
to
uphold
the
florida
supreme
court
rule
in
the
conviction
below.
thank
you.
