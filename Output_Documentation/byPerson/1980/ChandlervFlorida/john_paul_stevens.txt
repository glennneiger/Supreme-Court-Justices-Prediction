justice
stevens
what
was
the
evidence
of
actual
prejudice
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
didn't
the
supreme
court
just
take
judicial
notice
of
everything,
at
least
in
chief
justice
warren's
opinion
and
in
the
majority
opinion?
they
had
no
hearing
on
prejudice,
did
they?
justice
stevens
mr.
hirschhorn,
does
the
record
tell
us
why
the
portions
of
the
trial
that
were
televised
and
no
others?
in
other
words,
why
the
defense
case
was
not
televised?
justice
stevens
that
doesn't
explain
it
to
me.
justice
stevens
well,
are
you
telling
me
that
it
was
just
a
voluntary
decision
by
the
media
that
that's
all
they
wanted
to?
justice
stevens
does
the
record
also
tell
us
that...
as
i
understand,
there's
one
mini-camera
in
the
courtroom.
does
it
tell
us
what
it
picked
up
in
the
camera?
is
it
just
focused
on
the
witness,
or
is
it
on
the
whole
courtroom,
or
how
does
it,
what
is
the
picture
that
is
televised,
do
you
know?
justice
stevens
is
the
cameraman
in
the
courtroom
who
points
the
camera
in
different
directions?
it's
not
just
a
fixed
camera
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
were
concerned
about
what
the
neighbors
might
say
to
the
jurors
or
something
like
that--
justice
stevens
--related
to
the
selective
televising
of
the
prosecution's
case
and
not
the
defense
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
fox,
before
you
get
through
will
you
explain
to
me
why
the
estes
decision
is
not
squarely
in
point
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
holding
in
that
case
based
specifically
on
the
one
question
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
consider.
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
judgment
of
the
court
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
why
isn't
that
directly
in
point?
in
fact,
why
isn't
that
a
stronger
case
because
there
the
jury
was
sequestered?
justice
stevens
a
stronger
case
for
allowing
the
television.
justice
stevens
i
said,
it's
a
stronger
case
for
allowing
television
because
the
jury
was
sequestered.
justice
stevens
there
were
no
extreme
fact
circumstances.
i
understand
that
all
that
was
at
a
pre-trial
hearing
on
whether
or
not
to
allow
television.
at
the
trial
itself
they
had
a
thing
built
up
there
so
you
couldn't
notice
the
television
cameras,
and
there
was
no
disorder
during
the
trial,
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly.
justice
stevens
i
asked
you,
why
wasn't
the
holding
specifically
in
point
here?
justice
stevens
in
what
respect?
how
are
they
different,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
sequestered
there?
justice
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
trial,
too;
not
the
pre-trial
hearing.
justice
stevens
it
was
selected
portions
here
too,
though.
justice
stevens
the
court
declined
to
grant
certiorari
on
that
very
question.
that's
right.
justice
stevens
the
fact
that
he
relied
on
was
the
fact
that
it
was
a
notorious
case,
not
a
run-of-the-mill
case,
and
this
was
sufficiently
notorious
so
that
it
justified
2-1/2
minutes
on
the
evening
news.
do
you
rely
on
the
distinction
between
a
notorious
case
and
a
routine
case?
justice
stevens
the
estes
case
was
a
case
involving
a
lot
of
financial
records,
if
i
remember
the
opinion,
whereas
this
is
a
case
involving
a
couple
of
police
officers
who
allegedly
robbed
a
popular
restaurant.
justice
stevens
on
the
pre-trial
publicity
point
that's
certainly
true,
but
that
was
not
what
was
decided.
do
you
think
there'd
be
any
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
local
television
station
to
televise
a
case
involving
an
action
to
quiet
title
to
real
estate?
justice
stevens
what
if
it
was
yankee
stadium
or
the
gary
powers'
trial?
justice
stevens
you
wouldn't
have
to
ask
them
to
try
it
first
in
yankee
stadium?
justice
stevens
in
other
words
it
can't
apply
to
television.
there
are
a
lot
more
people
watching.
justice
stevens
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
i
understand
the
argument
that
the
televising
has
an
educational,
public
good
to
it.
and
i
understand
that
florida
is
the
sunshine
state
in
many
ways.
but
does
the
televising
in
your
submission
improve
the
quality
of
justice
that's
administered
in
a
courtroom?
justice
stevens
i
don't
imagine
the
ratings
would
have
been
too
good
on
that
show.
putting
that
to
one
side
for
a
moment,
one
thing
troubles
me
about
your
argument,
mr.
hirschhorn,
on
witnesses.
if
the
television
camera
does
adversely
affect
the
witness's
ability
to
testify
in
a
persuasive
way,
effective
way,
here
they
only
showed
prosecution
witnesses,
so
whatever
harm
was
done
to
this
trial
process
presumably
would
have
been
prejudicial
to
the
prosecution.
justice
stevens
but
does
the
jury
know
which
part
is
being
televised?
justice
stevens
because,
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
red
light
anymore.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see.
so
that
they
didn't
know
whether?
i
understand.
all
right.
