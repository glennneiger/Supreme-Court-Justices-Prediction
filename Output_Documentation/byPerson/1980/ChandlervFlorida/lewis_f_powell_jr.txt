justice
jr.
mr.
fox,
may
i
ask
this
question?
under
the
florida
rule,
does
the
trial
judge
under
any
circumstances
have
the
right
to
exclude
cameras,
including
television
cameras,
from
an
entire
trial?
justice
jr.
have
they
done
so
since
the
rule
was
adopted?
justice
jr.
what
considerations
impel
a
court
to
make
that
ruling?
justice
jr.
i
would
distinguish,
of
course,
the
printed
press
media.
you
have
different
authorities
that
control
that.
but
i
understand
your
answer
to
be
that
the
court
does
have
authority
to
exclude
all
cameras
from
the
entire
trial?
justice
jr.
why
was
it
done
in
that
case?
justice
jr.
have
you
had
a
case
yet
where
a
witness
after
being
sworn
but
before
taking
the
stand
simply
said
to
the
judge,
i've
been
camera-shy
all
my
life,
i
just
don't
think
i
can
possibly
testify
fairly
and
honestly
with
cameras
on
me?
justice
jr.
you
are
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
judge
has
full
discretion
to
exclude
cameras
from
the
courtroom?
justice
jr.
if
a
witness
or
a
juror
persuaded
him
that
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
justice?
justice
jr.
suppose
you
had
a
camera-shy
lawyer?
