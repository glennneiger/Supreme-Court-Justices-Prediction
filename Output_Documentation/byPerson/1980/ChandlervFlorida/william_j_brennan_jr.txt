justice
jr.
and
the
record
reflects
the
location
of
the
camera?
justice
jr.
mr.
hirschhorn,
you
referred
me
to
page
a36
and
that
diagram.
am
i
to
infer
that
the
word
electric
locates
the
camera?
justice
jr.
where
is
the
camera?
justice
jr.
i
see.
but
the
camera
is
over
in
the
public
seats
section,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
what's
the
evidence
that
the
participants
in
the
trial
and
the
jury
knew
that
they
were
being
televised?
justice
jr.
no,
no.
what
is
the
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
knew
the
proceedings
were
being
televised?
justice
jr.
well,
did
anyone
point
out
to
them
the
camera
located
where
it
is?
justice
jr.
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stevens
were
you
suggesting
that,
do
you
support
your
argument
in
the
fact
that
only
snippets
of
what
the
camera
picks
up
that
actually
are
broadcast
in
the
evening
news?
justice
jr.
and
to
what
effect?
