mr.
calvin
l.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
be
arguing
the
case
in
chief
here
this
morning.
the
attorney
general
of
florida
will
address
broader
policy
considerations
with
respect
to
the
17
states
and
the
conference
of
chief
justices
who
have
submitted
amicus
briefs
in
support
of
the
state's
position.
the
state's
position
in
this
case
is
quite
clear.
the
defendants
received
a
fair
trial.
the
defendants,
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor,
we
submit,
seek
to
turn
the
constitution
upside
down.
they
make
no
effort
whatsoever
to
discuss
how
noel
chandler
and
robert
granger
did
not
receive
a
fair
trial.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
the
estes
opinion,
your
honor,
as
i
am
sure
you
are
well
aware--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--it
is
a
plurality
opinion
in
which
only
four
members
of
the
court
joined
in
a
rule,
per
se
rule
against
judgment
of
the
court,
however,
reversing--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--it
is
a
stronger
case,
your
honor.
and
that's
precisely
the
point.
the
facts--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
but
on
the
other
hand
the
extreme
fact
circumstances
in
that
case--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--well,
mr.
justice...
well,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
court
focused
upon
pre-trial
hearings.
the
cables
snaking
all
over
the
floor--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--it
is
not
specifically
on
point,
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
circumstance
there.
the
facts
there
do
not
remotely
relate
to--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--the
facts
in
that
case,
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
trial
was
a
separate
and
distinctly
serene
proceeding.
in
fact,
we
would
submit
that
the
only
televised
portion
of
that
trial
was
the
prosecutor's
opening
and
closing
argument
i
believe.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
you're
certainly
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
infection
that
had
preceded
the
trial;
as,
for
example,
in
the
sheppard
case,
the
infection
that
had
preceded
the
trial--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--but,
your
honor,
a
reading
of
the
clark
opinion,
a
reading
of
the
warren,
douglas,
and
goldberg
opinions,
they
concentrate
entirely
upon
the
pre-trial
hearings,
and
the
infection
which
preceded
the
trial.
they
do
not
discuss
the
serenity
which
prevailed
at
the
trial.
they
do
not
separate--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--most
respectfully,
by
your
leave,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'd
submit
to
you
that
mr.
justice
harlan
would
not
have
joined
in
a
per
se
rule,
and
in
fact
he
did
not.
and
he
states
quite
clearly
in
his
opinion
that
he
restricts
his
holding
and
his
support
of
the
majority
opinion
to
the
very
fact
of
the
estes
trial,
the
facts
in
that
case,
the
extreme--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor,
that
becomes
a
question,
then.
what's
a
notorious
case?
i
would
submit
to
you
the
estes
case
was
a
notorious
case.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
it
certainly
does.
i
think
if
the
court
wants--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--pardon
me?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
any
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
any
trial.
or--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
or
to
an
estes
case,
or
to
a
zamora
case.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
that
three
minutes
on
the
evening
news
does
not
compare
to
the
eleven
volumes
of
publicity
in
the
trial
of
the
estes
case.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
as
the
wisconsin
brief
notes,
television
cameras
have
been
at
zoning
appeals,
at
traffic
appeals,
at
any
sort
of
civil
proceedings--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it
is
possible
that
a
circumstance
could
arise
where
a
quiet
title
case
could
be
publicized.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
that
was
the
case
i
had
in
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
your
honor,
that's
a
question
of
editorial
policy
which
i
think
this
court
has
not
intruded
into.
it's
a
matter
of
first
amendment
freedoms.
i
think
the
editorial
policy
of
the
stations
cannot
be
governed
by
this
court
or
any
court.
it
may
be
they
don't
have
the
time
or
the
expense
to
put
a
camera
in
every
courtroom
and
that
type
of
case
would
probably
certainly
have
a
very
low
priority.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
in
estes,
your
honor?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
this
case
was
a
brief
segment
of
the
jury
selection
and
a
brief
segment
of
the
state's
key
witness.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
has
clearly
in
the
final
paragraph
of
its
opinion
left
a
warning
to
the
media
that
any
abuses
by
the
media
would
result
in
a
rescission
of
the
rule.
now,
this
is
a
rule--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--pardon
me?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
your
honor,
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
the
court
says
that
the
past
abuses
of
the
press
are
in
the
past,
and
we
believe
that.
that
is
what
the
court
states
in
its
final
paragraph
of
the
post-newsweek
opinion.
and
i
think,
quite
clearly,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
left
it
open
for
abuses
by
the
press.
and
i
think
in
the
event
that
there
are
abuses
by
the
press,
in
the
event
that
the
trust
that
the
court
has
extended
in
balancing
the
public
policy
of
open
trials
and
open
government
in
florida,
i
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
quite
clearly
could
withdraw
the
rule.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
the
basis
in
the
rule
for
the
rescission,
your
honor?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
think
the
judicial
control
which
has
been
left
in
the
florida
trial
courts
by
the
rule.
it's
quite
clear
in
the
rule
that
the
judicial
control
and
discretion,
to
control
the
camera
and
the
media
and
disputes
among
the
media,
is
strictly
restricted
into
the
trial
court.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
think
it's
a
very
close
question.
i
think
the
trial
court
probably
would
and
then
we
could
litigate
it
from
there.
i
would
submit
to
you,
your
honor,
that
the
questions
that
the
defendant
raises
and
the
questions,
the
concerns
the
court
has
expressed
will
occur
in
any
sort
of
highly
publicized
case,
whether
it's
televised
or
not.
they
could
run
a
poll
in
any
sort
of
case,
whether
it's
publicized
or
not.
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
camera
is
there.
the
camera
does
not
change
the
circumstances.
the
camera
does
not
change
the
abuse
by
the
press.
if
the
press
is
going
to
abuse
the
circumstance
they
will
abuse
it,
no
matter
what.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
he
certainly
does.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
they
certainly
have.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
well,
the
rule
itself
states
quite
clearly
the
grounds
relating
to
the
difference
in
the
effect
upon
the
witness
as
opposed
to
the
general
public,
and
the
difference
relating
to
the
type
of
media
coverage.
as,
for
example,
the
trial
court
may
exclude
the
electronic
media
but
not
other
types
of
media.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
case,
palm
beach
newspapers
case
which
is
cited,
i
believe,
in
the
cbs
amicus
brief,
in
which
the
cameras
were
excluded.
and
that
issue
has--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--in
that
case
a
prisoner
had
objected
to
being
filmed
because
of
the
fact
that
he
felt
his
life
would
be
in
jeopardy
if
he
testified.
and
the
trial
court
closed
the
trial.
and
the
media
appealed;
the
4th
district
in
that
case
reversed,
stating
that
there
needed
to
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
issue,
and
that
the
motion
showed
a
prima
facie
case
but
then
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
that
case
is
currently
on
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
we're
in
a
frontier
area
here,
your
honor.
there
have
been
very,
very
few
cases
with
respect
to
closure
or
the
media
appealing
a
closure
or
the
defendant
appealing
from
an
issue
where
closure
was
denied.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
we
have
a
case
involving
a
defendant,
green
v.
state,
cited
in
our
brief,
where
the
defendant
stated
a
long
winding
motion
about
her
background
and
her
social
upbringing
and
so
forth,
and
she
stated
that
she
was
bothered
with
conferring
with
her
counsel.
in
that
case
the
trial
court
denied
closure,
but
the
3rd
district
court
of
appeal
reversed
that
case
and
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing,
stating
that
the
defendant
had
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
state--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
a
full
discretion
should
rest
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
well,
your
honor,
that
relates
to
another
issue,
i
think,
an
issue
which
this
court
has
occasionally
had
a
chance
to
address,
mr.
chief
justice,
involving
the
quality
of
representation,
the
quality
of
trial
court
judges,
and
so
forth.
we
submit
that
the
exposure
of
the
trial
courts
and
the
attorneys
to
public
scrutiny
i
think
will
have
an
educative
effect
upon
the
public.
i
think
an
incompetent
attorney
will
clearly
be
demonstrated
in
front
of
the
cameras.
i
think
a
trial
judge
who
is
not
up
on
the
law
will
clearly
be
demonstrated
by
the
actual
and
real
picture
of
what's
going
on.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
would
submit
to
you,
the
man,
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
in
1956,
an
attorney
who
is
a
strutter,
an
attorney
who
is
a
show-off
an
attorney
who's
incompetent,
is
going
to
be
incompetent,
a
show-off
or
a
strutter,
whether
the
cameras
are
there
or
not.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
submit
to
you
that
that
is
precisely
what
we've
argued
in
our
brief.
we
should
proceed
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
in
the
event
that
is
shown,
in
the
event
that
a
defendant
files
a
3.850
proceeding
in
florida
collaterally
attacking
the
competency
of
his
counsel,
then
we
should
proceed
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
we
should
not
predicate
our
decision
in
this
case
upon
conjecture,
but
upon
the
demonstrable
reality,
as
the
court
stated
in
beck
v.
washington.
the
attorney
general
of
florida
will
address
the
court
now.
thank
you.
