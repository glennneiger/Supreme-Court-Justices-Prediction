chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
the
case
of
chandler
and
granger
v.
florida.
mr.
hirschhorn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
but
this
was
both
audio
and
visual?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
recording
was
made
of
the
entire
trial?
chief
justice
burger
how
about
the
defense
evidence?
chief
justice
burger
now,
when
you
say
you
know
these
things,
do
you
get
them
by
osmosis
or
how
do
you...
i
realize
we
all
"know"
certain
things
that
we
can't
demonstrate,
but
when
you
say
you
know,
this
is
from
your
own
experience
as
a
litigation
lawyer?
chief
justice
burger
what
did
you
tender
before
trial
that
would
support
what
you
now
say
you
know?
what
did
you
tender
to
support
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
burger
i
mean
at
the
trial
court
level,
when
you
first
were
confronted
with
the
problem,
did
you
make
an
offer
of
proof
to
the
court,
or
did
the
court
deny
you
any
opportunity
to
do
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
to
pursue
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
and
then
several
others,
are
we
to
rely,
for
example,
on...
to
take
some
current
things...
a
question
and
answer
interview
by
george
ball
in
the
current
issue
of
newsweek,
something
like
that,
and
a
column
by
a
columnist
in
the
washington
post,
ellen
goodman,
who
said
that
television
tends
to
distort
the
processes
that
it
depicts?
is
that
the
kind
of
thing
we
as
a
reviewing
court
can
rely
on?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
hirschhorn,
obviously
the
behavioral
scientists'
views
are
relevant
here.
but
if
no
courtrooms
undertake
to
try
this
out,
how
will
behavioral
scientists
or
judges,
or
anyone
else,
accumulate
some
empirical
data,
if
empirical
data
will
ever
be
available
on
the
consequences,
instead
of
just
what
might
be
called
speculation
by
behavioral
scientists
and
judges?
chief
justice
burger
under
the
florida
procedure
can
the
complaining
witness...
does
the
trial
judge
have
discretion
to
exclude
any
pictures
if
the
complaining
witness
is
testifying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
burger
the
action
to
quiet
title
that
i
hypothesized.
do
you
think
there'd
be
any
interest
in
a
television
station
or
in
any
of
the
people
who
watch
television
to
see
that
kind
of
a
trial?
chief
justice
burger
oh,
i
suppose...
i'm
talking
about
the
typical
action
to
quiet
title.
i
picked
the
lease
noticeable.
if
it
were
an
action
to
quiet
title
on
the
state
capitol,
i
assume
it
would
be
quite
news.
chief
justice
burger
but
to
quiet
title
on
an
ordinary
residence,
would
television
be
interested
in
it?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
ask
you
this
hypothetical
question
since
we
have
no
empirical
evidence
in
the
record.
suppose
in
this
particular
case
the
television
after
showing
whatever
it
was
they
showed,
the
opening
statement
and
the
closing
arguments
of
the
prosecution?
chief
justice
burger
no,
this
case.
chief
justice
burger
now,
that's
all
the
television
viewers
saw,
was
the
witness?
chief
justice
burger
suppose
that
they
then
followed
a
recent
example
and
said,
call
993-1234
if
you
think
this
fellow
is
guilty,
no
toll
charge.
call
111-4567
if
you
think
he's
not
guilty,
and
we'll
take
a
poll.
would
the
court
under
the
florida
rule
have
any
authority
to
say,
no,
you
can't
do
that?
chief
justice
burger
if
they
abuse
the
first
amendment,
the
supreme
court's
going
to
go
after
them?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
the
way
you
read
that
rule?
chief
justice
burger
is
that
the
way
you
read
that
rule?
chief
justice
burger
what
would
be
your
view,
if
you
care
to
express
it,
on
whether
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
rules,
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
to
take
this
instant
ballot
having
heard
only
the
prosecution's
evidence?
chief
justice
burger
could
the
court
have
found
them
in
contempt
for
doing
that?
chief
justice
burger
could
they?
could
the
court
properly
find
them
in
contempt
for
having
shown
only
the
prosecution's
case
and
then
taken
an
instant
poll
on
guilty
or
innocent?
chief
justice
burger
i
understood
mr.
justice
powell
to
be
probing
at
the
idea
that
even
a
competent
lawyer
might
be
less
competent
if
he
was
allergic
to
cameras?
chief
justice
burger
and
therefore
his
performance
might
be
negatively
affected.
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
i
put
and
that
i
thought
mr.
justice
powell
was
probing
at.
what
if
the
very
presence
of
the
camera
as
with
the
camera-shy
witness,
impairs
the
functioning
of
a
highly
self-conscious
lawyer,
if
you
can
hypothesize
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
burger
are
you
telling
us,
mr.
attorney
general,
that
broadcasting
two
minutes
and
52
seconds,
was
it,
or
55
seconds
of
the
prosecution's
case
only,
just
one
side
of
the
case,
has
contributed
something
significant
to
the
improvement
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
florida?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
just
talking
about
television
now,
in
broadcasting
the
live
action,
not
the--
chief
justice
burger
--is
there
any
possibility,
significant
possibility,
that
the
listening
audience
having
watched
two
minutes
and
55
seconds
of
the
prosecution's
case
only,
and
later
the
jury
finds
the
defendants
in
a
particular
case
not
guilty,
that
the
jurors
will
be
subject
to
criticism
of
their
neighbors
and
their
friends
and
their
associates
for
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
when
they
have
seen
evidence
only
of
guilt?
is
that
a
possibility
that
the
courts
should
take
into
account?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
question
of
whether
it
has
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
as
a
rule,
is
part
of
the
total
question
before
this
court,
not
whether
it's
a
good
idea
for
the
television
stations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
hirschhorn,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
also
have
for
announcement
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
79-1260,
chandler
against
florida.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
affirmed.
justices
stewart
and
white
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
