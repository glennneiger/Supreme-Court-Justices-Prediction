mr.
leslie
scherr
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
a
couple
of
the
comments
made
by
counsel
should
be
addressed
specifically.
firstly,
the
counsel
for
pepco
raises
the
specter
of
athletes
who
are
operated
on
in
the
same
manner
in
which
mr.
cross
was
operated
on
and
then
return
to
work.
that
is,
playing
football.
and
mr.
turner
goes
on
to
say
that
this
man
decided
he
could
not
do
it.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
clear
and
a
reading
of
the
transcript
will
show
that
it
was
the
doctors
who
prohibited
mr.
cross
from
returning
to
his
full
duties.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
not
his
doctors
but
pepco's
doctors,
pepco's
in-house
doctors
and
pepco's
consulting
doctors.
and
it's
a
point
that
should
not
be
overlooked.
mr.
turner
also
mentions
the
fact,
rather
than
speculate
with
respect
to
the
damages
that
mr.
cross
might
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
injury
to
his
knee,
that
his
exclusive
remedy
should
be
under
the
schedule.
rather
than
speculate
as
to
the
damages,
i
think
a
review
of
petitioner's
brief
at
page
48a
will
demonstrate
clearly
that
an
in-depth
analysis
was
conducted
by
the
administrative
law
judge
in
order
to
determine
what
mr.
cross's
actual
wage-earning
losses
were.
what
the
administrative
law
judge
did
was
to
review
mr.
cross's
wages
for
three
full
years
prior
to
his
injury
and
for
the
year
following
his
injury.
mr.
leslie
scherr
your
honor,
we
never
claimed
under
the
schedule.
when
i
say
mr.
cross
since
he
first
came
in
my
office
and
we
filed
this
claim.
we
never
claimed
that
his
loss
was
the
removal
of
the
medial
meniscus
of
his
left
knee,
we
never
claimed
that
the
fact
that
he
limped
was
his
problem.
we
claimed
that
he
sustained
a
loss
of
over
$6,000
per
year
in
wages.
that's
his
loss.
now,
mr.
turner
tells
us
that...
both
in
his
brief
and
in
oral
argument...
that
mr.
cross
wants
over
$130,000.
that's
not
speculation.
that's
true.
he
wants
over
$130,000,
not
because
he's
greedy
or
venal,
but
because
his
actual
loss,
not
projected,
but
actual
loss
based
upon
what
he
earned
before
and
what
he
can
earn
now,
is
in
excess
of
$200,000
a
year.
mr.
leslie
scherr
it's
for
this
court,
your
honor,
to
decide
what
the
federal
statute
means.
our
position
is
clear.
the
federal
statute,
the
purpose
of
the
federal
statute
is
to
compensate
the
injury.
the
injury
is,
in
this
case
as
in
all
cases,
where
there's
a
loss
of
earnings,
the
loss
of
earnings.
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
shows
us
at
least
that
h.e.
21
was
in
the
original
statute
and
then
it
was
amended
before
it
was
enacted
to
include
the
schedule.
our
position
is
that
congress
meant
to
say
that
where
there
is
a
wage-earning
loss,
the
employee
can
claim
for
that
wage-earning
loss,
because
that,
after
all,
is
his
injury.
where
there's
no
wage-earning
loss
but
a
corresponding
anatomical
loss,
then
the
employer
get
to
share
in
that
loss.
that
is,
i
as
an
attorney,
if
i
as
an
employee
of
a
corporation
and
i
lost
my
hand
in
an
industrial
accident
or
while
i
was
on
the
job,
i
can
continue
earning
a
living
despite
the
fact
that
i
lost
my
hand.
my
secretary,
however,
can't
do
that.
my
secretary
i
liken
to
terry
cross
because
without
her
hand
i
could
say,
okay,
from
now
on
you're
going
to
be
a
receptionist.
you
need
one
hand
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
to
say,
"law
offices",
and
then
hang
up
the
phone
again.
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
else.
but
rather
than
hand
potentially
$20,000
a
year
to
a
secretary,
you
limit
that
to
$10,000
a
year.
under
pepco's
reading
of
the
statute
the
employee
get
100
percent
schedule
disability
for
the
loss
of
a
hand
and
nothing
to
reflect
what
are
actual
wage-earning
losses.
another
anomaly
that
comes
up
under
the
pepco's
reading
of
the
statute
is,
take
terry
cross.
exactly
the
same
circumstances,
don't
change
a
fact
except
that
rather
than
the
injury
to
his
right
knee
which
caused
pepco's
doctors
to
deny
him
his
work,
his
injury
was
to
his
back,
a
foot
and
a
half
higher
up
and
then
a
little
bit
around
to
the
right.
under
those
circumstances
there
would
be
no
question
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
two-thirds
the
difference
under
what
pepco
would
like
to
believe
is
the
only
reason
to
have
the
"other
cases"
provision
in
the
statute.
that
can't
be
true.
it
can't
be
that
if
terry
cross
loses
$6,000
a
year
because
of
his
knee,
he
gets
a
total
of
$3,000
as
mr.
turner
advocated
at
the
administrative
hearing
below
was
that
if
terry
cross
had
the
exact
same
wage-earning
loss
because
of
an
injury
to
his
back,
he
gets
$130,000
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
and
it
should
be
noted
again
that
the
$130,000
that
terry
cross
has
been
awarded,
and
which
award
has
been
affirmed,
is
not
a
windfall
for
mr.
cross.
this
is
not
in
addition
to
what
he
otherwise
would
have
made.
this
merely
compensates
him
to
the
extent
of
two-thirds
the
difference
of
what
he
would
have
made
had
he
not
been
injured.
further,
it
is
our
position
that
the
congressional
intent
is
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
entire
section
(8),
and
that
is
with
respect
to
permanent
total
disability,
temporary
partial
disability,
and
temporary
total
disability,
as
well
as
permanent
partial
disability,
in
every
case
congress
has
seen
fit
to
award
the
employee
a
percentage
of
the
difference
of
his
actual
loss.
the
only
exception
is
the
so-called
schedule,
sections
8(c)(1)
through
(19).
and
as
we
submit,
it
is
an
afterthought
of
congress
that
even
if
there
is
no
actual
wage-earning
loss,
that
an
employee
should
receive
some
compensation
for
his
anatomical
losses
with
whatever
suffering
is
occasioned
by
that
anatomical
loss.
and
it
not
meant
to
be
exclusive,
it
is
meant
to
be
a
minimum,
it
is
meant
to
be
one
arm
of
an
alternative
that
the
employee
can
take
either
the
schedule
loss
as
a
minimum
or
alternatively
he
can
take
under
the
unscheduled
loss,
if
he
can
in
fact
prove
as
mr.
cross
can
and
has
proven
in
this
case
that
his
actual
earning
loss
is
far
greater
than
what
he
would
receive
under
the
schedule
loss
provisions--
mr.
leslie
scherr
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
leslie
scherr
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
court
should
note
that
in
the
eight
years
since
the
minimums
were
removed
in
1972,
only
five
cases
have
been
decided
by
the
benefits
review
board
with
respect
to
this
issue.
mr.
leslie
scherr
benefits
assistance
for
all
jurisdictions,
your
honor.
this
is
a
benefits
assistance
for
all
federal
workmen's
compensation
cases.
those
cases
are
mason
v.
old
dominion;
collins
v.
todd;
brandt
v.
avondale
shipyards;
richardson
v.
perna
and
cantrell;
and
the
terry
cross
case.
there
are
no
other
cases
of
the
hundreds
of
perhaps
thousands
that
come
before
the
benefits
review
board
that
has
had
as
an
issue
the
particular
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
leslie
scherr
yes,
sir,
which
i'm
sure
there
a
million
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers,
and
it
also
pertains
to
all
employees
in
the
district
of
columbia,
with
certain
exceptions.
so
there
are
a
million
and
a
half,
two
million
employees
to
which
this
particular
act
pertains.
and
with
all
of
those
claims
and
all
those
people,
only
five
cases
have
arisen
in
all
those
years,
in
eight
years.
mr.
leslie
scherr
yes,
sir.
we're
only
dealing
with
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
mr.
leslie
scherr
yes,
sir.
it
covers
longshoremen
and
highway
workers
across
the
country.
mr.
leslie
scherr
yes,
sir;
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
scherr
yes,
sir,
five
cases,
the
ones
that
i
named.
mr.
leslie
scherr
the
cases
generally
go
from
an
informal
conference
to
an
administrative
law
judge
in
which
case
there's
a
record,
a
transcript.
it
goes
then
to
the
benefits
review
board--
mr.
leslie
scherr
--there
is
no
record,
your
honor.
there
is
no
way
for
us
to
find
out
but
we
do
know--
mr.
leslie
scherr
--yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
scherr
i
would
heartily
suggest
that
would
be
true,
and
i
agree,
justice
white,
that
it
probably
happens
all
the
time,
but
there
are,
the
fear
of--
mr.
leslie
scherr
--i
thank
you
for
the
compliment,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
plain
reading
of
the
entire
statute
would
make
it
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
compensate
employees
for
actual
loss
of
wages
and
not
for
the
benefits
review
board
or
the
administrative
law
judges
to
slavishly
follow
a
schedule
and
say,
a
knee...
$3,000,
despite
the
fact
that
your
actual
wage-earning
loss
which
loss
occurs
because
your
working
for
the
employer
is
only
five
percent
of
the
loss
of
use
of
your
knee.
i
urge
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
terry
cross
wants
to
work.
he
wants
to
continue
to
work
without
being
penalized
economically
for
the
injury
suffered
while
working
for
this
employer.
and
i
believe
that
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
can
be
construed
in
terms
of
all
four
types
of
injuries
to
allow
him
to
continue
to
work,
not
have
to
claim
permanent
and
total
disability,
have
the
employer
supplement
the
difference
between
what
he
was
earning
before
the
injury
and
after
the
injury
by
two-thirds,
and
be
constant
with
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
meaning
of
the
act.
thank
you.
