justice
stewart
mr.
turner,
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
in
your
view
hold
that
the
schedule
provided
a
minimum
that
was
payable
in
any
event?
justice
stewart
but,
in
any
event,
he's...
if
he
can
prove
nothing
at
all
except
the
extent
of
his
permanent
partial
and
that
it's
covered
by
the
schedule,
he
gets
what
the
schedule
gives?
justice
stewart
and
entitled
to
appeal
the
decision?
justice
stewart
not
an
alternative,
it's
not
an
alternative,
it's
a
minimum?
justice
stewart
because
two
arguments
are
made
here,
as
you
know,
by
your
opponents.
justice
stewart
one
of
them
says
there's
a
minimum,
the
other
says
it's
an
alternative.
justice
stewart
but
it's
exclusive;
that's
your
point.
justice
stewart
your
point
is
that
it's
exclusive.
