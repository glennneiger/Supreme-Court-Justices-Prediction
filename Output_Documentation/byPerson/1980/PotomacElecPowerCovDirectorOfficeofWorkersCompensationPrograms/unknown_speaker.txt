unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals,
you
think,
said
that
the
schedule
provided
a
minimum?
unknown
speaker
that
will
go
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
but
he
always
gets
the
scheduled
payment?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
had
no
loss
of
earnings?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
schedule
will
be
the
starting
point?
unknown
speaker
mr.
turner,
it
isn't
simply
that
it
will
be
the
starting
point,
because
even
under
the
court
of
appeals
view
would
he
not
have
to
choose
between
the
schedule
and
this
alternative
approach?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
happened
and
it's
the
case
you
supposed
earlier,
if
he
lost
a
finger
but
he
kept
the
same
job,
then
he'd
use
the
schedule,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
he
wouldn't
even
try
the
other
approach?
unknown
speaker
what,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
the
difference
in
the
amount
of
the
award?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
schedule?
unknown
speaker
unless
the
4th
circuit
would--
unknown
speaker
--unless
the
4th
circuit
adopted
the
same
rule
as
the
district--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there
aren't...
in
typical
state
workmen's
compensation
statutes,
schedules
of
the
kind
involved
here
are
on
their
way
out,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
professor
larson
says
so,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
here--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
do
have
a
schedule
here?
unknown
speaker
and
the
trend
in
the
state
cases
is
initiative
by
the
legislature
abolishing
the
schedule.
unknown
speaker
congress
has
done
this
with
the
federal
employees
compensation
act?
unknown
speaker
but
it
hasn't
done
it
with
the
longshoremen?
unknown
speaker
but,
although
that's
been
on
the
books
a
long
time--
unknown
speaker
--the
congress
has
never
done
anything
to
the
longshoremen's
act
although
the
longshoremen's
act
has
been
modified?
unknown
speaker
mr.
turner,
how
long
have
private
employers
in
the
district
been
subject
to
the
longshore
act?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
a
little
incongruous.
but
it's
just
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
even
though
there
isn't
a
longshoreman
or
a
boat
handler--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
turner,
before
you
sit
down,
just
because
i
didn't
quite
follow
you,
the
longo
case,
i
understand,
was
that
they
held
a
total
disability
and
therefore
that
really
isn't
in
point?
unknown
speaker
that's
hearing
loss.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
mason?
if
mason
in
your
view
was
incorrectly
decided,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
they
allowed
relief
under
the
all-other-cases
language?
all-other-cases
language.
unknown
speaker
you
make
a
distinction
between
compelling
language
and
plain
language?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
i
was
asking
you.
is
there
a
distinction
between
compelling
language
and
plain
language,
or
is
plain
language
presumably
compelling?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
stillman,
how
do
you
explain
away
the
two
words
in
(21),
"other
cases"?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that
explanation
almost
assumes
a
result,
doesn't
it?
certainly
this
individual
who
qualified
under
the
schedule--
unknown
speaker
--and
hence
one
can
certainly
argue
that
his
is
not
an
"other
case".
unknown
speaker
now,
before
you
get
to
that,
mrs.
stillman,
do
i
understand
you
to
suggest
that
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
schedule
because
it
holds
within
other
cases?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
your
positions?
unknown
speaker
now,
each
of
you
says
that
the
schedule
is
a
minimum.
recoverable
in
any
event
without
any
proof
whatsoever
of
loss
of
earnings?
unknown
speaker
well,
forgive
me
for
interrupting
again,
but
then,
after
what
you've
just
said
to
my
brother
stewart,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
case
is
one
in
which,
yes,
he
falls
within
the
schedule--
unknown
speaker
--but
he
also
is
permitted
the
opportunity
under
other
cases
to
show
he
has
a
greater
disability?
unknown
speaker
so
this
case
is
both
a
scheduled
case
and
an
"other
case"?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
just
that?
isn't
that
a
contradiction
in
terms?
unknown
speaker
you
say
he
can
always
get
the
schedule.
unknown
speaker
or,
he
can
elect
it.
it
is
a
scheduled
case,
if
he
elects
it
to
have...
at
least
that,
you'd
say,
if
he
elects
it
as
a
scheduled
case.
unknown
speaker
the
way
you
put
it
a
minute
ago,
though,
he
could
always
get
the
minimum--
unknown
speaker
--which
means
that
it's
both.
you
claim
it's
both.
it's
a
scheduled
case
and
an
"other
case"
too.
unknown
speaker
very
strange
language
to
describe
it.
unknown
speaker
not
only
potentially,
but
may
he
take
the
schedule
and
thereafter
say,
now
i'd
like
some
more?
no.
well,
i
wanted...
what
is
your
view
on
that?
unknown
speaker
another
simple
question:
yes
or
no?
i
could
answer
it
for
you.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
giving
him
credit
for
what
he's
been
paid?
unknown
speaker
but
your
answer
then
is
no.
he
can't
get
both?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
now,
if
that's
true,
and
he
qualifies
for
the
schedule,
what
do
you
do
with
the
word
(c):
it
"shall"
be
paid
to
the
employee
as
follows.
you're
saying
he
has
an
option,
it's
may
be
paid
rather
than
shall
be
paid?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
that
one?
unknown
speaker
and
it
really
should
be
read
as
"may"?
unknown
speaker
well,
surely,
you
must
concede
that
those
two
words
"other
cases"
is
the
big
hurdle
in
the
government's
case.
unknown
speaker
how...
for
how
many
years
was
the
act
construed
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a...
a
time--
unknown
speaker
--to
justice
white's
question,
i
mean
the
act
was
passed
in
1927,
amended
in
'49.
he
asked
you,
how
many
years
was
it
construed
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
evidence
in
the
courts.
what
i'm
asking,
who
decided
these
cases
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
how
did
they
construe
them?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
know?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
think...
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
there
was
never
a
case
where
a
person
suffering
a
schedule
disability
couldn't
have
proved
more
damages?
unknown
speaker
and
wouldn't
have
thought
about
trying
to.
unknown
speaker
that
hardly
answers
my
question,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
know,
you
really
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--you
know
that
the
though.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
the
new
york
statute,
i
think,
on
which
this
one
was
originally
patterned,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
started
to
say,
i
think,
that
the
proposed
legislation
that
was
not
enacted
would
not
be
the
same
as
your
argument
today?
unknown
speaker
that
provided
that
a
person
would
take
the
schedule
and
then
if
thereafter
he
could
prove
additional--
unknown
speaker
--she
was
told,
in
any
event,
by
the
new
york
courts
that
her
view
was
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
you
may
recall
what
justice
frankfurter
once
said,
that
if
the
language
of
a
statute
is
clear
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
he
put
it
in
the
reverse,
but
that
was
the
idea.
unknown
speaker
was
that
just
wrong,
or
false,
or--
unknown
speaker
--it
certainly
couldn't
have
been
inadvertent,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
issue
or
not?
that's
what
the
footnote
said.
unknown
speaker
are
mutually
exclusive?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
ambiguous
about
that?
unknown
speaker
what's
ambiguous
about
that?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
stillman,
is
this
a
two-way
street?
for
instance,
if
under
subsection
(7)
or
subsection
(6)
a
person
lost
a
thumb
and
got
this
schedule
compensation
of
75
weeks,
could
the
employer
come
back
in
at
the
end
of
40
weeks
and
say,
look,
this
man
is
being
overcompensated?
unknown
speaker
then
"in
other
cases",
just
in
your
reading,
simply
means
in
any
case
in
which
the
employee
chooses
to
go
outside
the
schedule?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
a
jury
is
expected
to
do,
i
suppose,
in
a
personal
injury
suit.
but
this
is
a
compensation
act
where
you
have
a
schedule
of
disabilities.
unknown
speaker
but
hasn't
this
been
true
for
a
long
time
under
workmen's
compensation
acts
for
50,
75
years,
that
the
schedule
awards
sometimes
are
higher
and
sometimes
are
lower
that
what
they
might
get
from
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
attempts
to
prove
a
case
of
a
leg's
loss
exceeding
scheduled
amount
and
fails
to
prove
it,
he
just
fails
to
prove
it.
he's
in
any
event
is
going
to
get
his
scheduled
loss?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
suggesting
that
any
case
like
this
is
at
least
potentially
two
kinds
of
cases.
one,
it's
an
anatomical
loss,
certainly,
within
the
schedule
and
if
there
had
been
wage
losses,
it's
a
wage
loss
case
too.
unknown
speaker
what
cases
do
you
mean?
in
this
jurisdiction
or
all
over
the
country?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
issue
arises
only
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
under
the...
is
this
under
the
longshoremen's
act
generally
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
covers
a
lot
of
people
besides
the
people
in
the
district
of
columbia.
unknown
speaker
all
employees
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
all
longshoremen
everywhere.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
say
there
have
only
been
five
cases
in
the,
in
the
review
board?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
how
many
thousands
of
cases
there
have
been
decided
by
whoever
those
cases
are
appealed
from.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
many
cases
like
this
have
been
before
administrative
law
judges?
you
just
don't
know,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
he
replaced
the
deputy
commissioner.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
suggesting
that
in
this
large
population
of
workers
there
are
only
five
times
that
the
person
injured
had
a
schedule
loss
that
wasn't
adequate
to
take
care
of
his
economic
loss?
i
would
think
it
would
happen
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
is
it
more
likely
that
there
are
only
five
lawyers
who
thought
of
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10
o'clock.
