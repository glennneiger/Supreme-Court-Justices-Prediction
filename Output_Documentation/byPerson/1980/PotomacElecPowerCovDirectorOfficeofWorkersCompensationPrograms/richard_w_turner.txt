mr.
richard
w.
turner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
case
involving
a
rather
narrow
issue
but
one
that
is
important
in
that
there
is
a
complete
division
of
authority
between
two
circuits
on
exactly
the
same
narrow
issue.
if
i
may
for
a
moment
try
to
explain
the
issue
in,
i
think,
simple
language,
the
question
is,
does
the
language
of
the
statute
have
its
plain
meaning
or
does
the
language
need
interpretation?
do
the
schedules
that
are
promulgated
in
sections
8(c)(1)
through
(19),
are
they
exhaustive
or
are
they
only
a
minimum
schedule?
is
a
workman
who
is
admittedly
injured
in
the
course
of
employment
and
having
sustained
a
permanent
partial
disability
according
to
the
schedule,
is
he
limited
to
what
the
schedule
says?
or
if
he
can
prove
loss
of
earnings
beyond
that
point,
can
he
then
have
more
compensation
awarded
him?
i
think
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court;
that
is
the
point
on
which
the
two
circuits
have
completely
disagreed.
the
5th
circuit
in
the
case
of
williams
vs.
donovan
in
1966
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
one
paragraph
long
agreed
completely
with
the
district
court
that
the
statute
meant
exactly
what
it
said
and
that
no
court,
no
deputy
commissioner,
had
a
right
to
give
any
more
than
the
schedules
called
for.
when
we
now
come
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
they
decided
the
opposite
of
that.
they
decided
that
in
effect
the
schedule
is
meaningless
unless
the
man's
injury
and
damage
is
less
than
or
equal
to
the
schedule,
that
if
he
can
show
more
than
that,
then
this
is
one
of
the
so-called
other
cases,
8(c)(21)
of
the
act.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
not
an
"other"
case.
the
case
is
clearly
one
of
scheduled
injury.
we
think
that
the
history
of
the
act,
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
compel
a
finding
that
those
schedules
are
exhaustive
and
not
minimal.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
i
think
so,
sir.
they
certainly
say
that
any
man
who
can
prove
more
loss
of
earnings
than
the
schedule
calls
for
is
entitled
to
claim
it
and
it
must
be
paid.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
absolutely,
sir.
he
is
entitled
to
a
decision.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
he
is
entitled
to
the
full
amount
of
the
schedule.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
oh,
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
yes.
they
say...
one
of
them
says
the
government--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--that's
right,
sir.
the
other
one
says
it's
a
minimal.
we
say
that
it
is
neither
an
alternative
nor
is
it
a
minimal
schedule.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
sir?
mr.
richard
w.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
they
say
that--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--in
any
event,
if
the
man
can
prove
more,
he
can
obtain
more.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
he
always
must
get
the
scheduled.
this
statute
is
50
years
old
and
there
never
has
been
any
deviation
from
that
point
of
view,
that,
no
matter
how
little
the
man
was
injured,
he
was
entitled
to
the
full
amount
that
the
schedule
called
for.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
even
though
he
had
no
loss
of
earnings.
let's
say
that
he
completely
lost
a
finger
and
the
doctor
bandaged
it
up
and
sent
him
back
to
work
two
days
later,
he
still
would
get
the
entire
amount
called
for
by
the
schedules.
but
he
could
not,
under
the
old
administrative
procedures
which
were
done
by
deputy
commissioners
and
finally
united
states
court
of
appeals,
which
was
the
system
then,
he
could
not
get
more
than
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
of
these
cases
of
so-called
schedule
injuries
are
normally
completely
disposed
of
at
a
very
informal
level.
such
as
the
case
of
this
one
where
a
man
has
his
operating
surgeon
say
that
he
had
a
five
percent
disability,
another
examining
physician
says
he
has
20
percent
disability,
but
only
of
the
leg;
there
was
no
other
part
of
the
body
involved,
there
was
no
other
attempt
to
give
any
other
rating.
normally,
this
man
would
have
gone
before
simply
a
claims
examiner
at
the
informal
level.
the
claims
examiner
would
have
looked
at
it
and
said,
your
doctor
says
five,
his
doctor
says
20,
i
think
you
should
have
15.
and
neither
side
would
be
completely
satisfied
but
both
of
them
would
go
away
and
the
case
would
be
done
and
forever
gone.
if
this
act,
if
this
case
is
now
affirmed
here
by
this
court,
then
that
will
no
longer
happen,
because
the
claims
examiner,
he
hears
it
informally,
will
have
no
schedule
with
which
to
work.
he
will
have
to
try
to
find
out
how
much
can
this
man
do
in
the
future,
what
has
he
done
in
the
past?
mr.
richard
w.
turner
yes,
sir,
only
the
starting
point.
because,
obviously,
everyone
is
going
to
make
his
claim
for
as
much
as
he
can;
no
one
goes
in
and
says,
i
want
just
the
minimum,
but
whatever
i
can
get.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
my
understanding,
sir,
that
you
would
not
have
to
choose.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
then
he
wouldn't
even
try,
but
to
use
a
more
extreme
case...
use
this
one,
in
which
the
man
has
had
this
minor
injury
to
the
leg,
a
minor
operation.
ball
players
go
back
to
playing
football
or
other
athletic
events
every
day
in
a
short
time
after
such
an
injury.
this
man
decided
that
he
couldn't,
or
he
wouldn't,
do
all
of
the
work
that
he
had
to
do
in
his
job.
and
his
job
was
admittedly
a
heavy
one.
he
was
a
cable
splicer
a
and
is
a
cable
splicer
a
for
the
power
company.
he
does
heavy
work.
he
lifts
things,
he
climbs
in
and
out
of
manholes,
he
climbs
ladders.
but
he
decided
that
he
couldn't
do
all
of
this,
so
for
that
reason,
because
he
decided
that
he
couldn't
do
it,
then
the
company
could
not
allow
him
to
be
promoted
along
with
the
other
men
who
were
doing
all
of
their
job.
they
could
not
allow
him
to
work
overtime,
which
pays
time-and-a-half
and
double
time
on
saturdays,
sundays,
and
holidays.
they
simply
couldn't
allow
that.
so
because
of
that
fact,
the
lack
of
one
or
two
regular
promotions
that
other
men
got,
the
lack
of
working
overtime,
this
man
showed
an
actual
loss
of
earnings,
compared
to
other
men
similarly
situated.
now,
the
administrative
law
judge
who
heard
this
case
is
bound
by
decisions
of
the
benefits
review
board.
consequently
he
decided
that
because
of
this
loss
of
earnings
he
would
decide
it,
not
under
the
schedule
of
losses,
or
8(c)(2),
(19),
but
under
8(c)(21)
which
is
the
other
cases
provision
of
the
act.
and
he
decided
that
this
man
then
should,
this
case
should
then
be
decided
under
that
point,
and
the
man
got
an
award
for
permanent
partial
disability
based
not
on
his
actual
wages
at
the
time
of
injury,
as
8(c)(2),
(19)
says,
but
under
his
so-called
work...
his
loss
of
earning
capacity
under
8(c)(21).
it's
an
entirely
different
thing.
it
provides
for
a
great
deal
of
speculation
and--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--well,
the
amount
to
this
man,
sir,
could
amount
to
a
hundred
and
some
thousand
dollars.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
and
under
the
schedule
at
the
full
20
percent
it
would
be
some
$12,000
to
$13,000.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference.
this
case
has
particular
importance,
by
the
way,
to
the
district
of
columbia
itself,
i
think.
the
district
of
columbia...
i
suppose
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
the
newspapers
are
full
of
its
efforts
to
write
its
own
workmen's
compensation
act,
businesses
being
squeezed
by
the
onerous
burden
of
the
longshore
act
are
simply
moving
out
of
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
a
terrific
burden
for
business
to
compete
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
the
suburban
districts.
at
any
rate--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--sir?
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that
is
correct,
sir.
they
have
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
believe
they
have
faced
the
exact
question.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
well,
sir,
professor
larson
in
his
book
says
that--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--there
is
a
trend
in
that
way.
but
i
think
that
no
matter
what
the
trend
may
be
in
state
cases--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--it
has
nothing
to
do.
the
issue
here
is
a
congressional
statute
and
the
state
cases.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
new
york
legislature
in
1970
modified
their
act
to
give
it
just
this
exact
change.
the
new
york
court,
prior
to
that
time,
had
followed
the
schedules
very
strictly.
they
had
maintained
this
dichotomy
between
the
scheduled
losses
and
the
"other
cases".
but
in
1972
when
the
new
york
legislature
felt
it
was
time
to
make
this
change,
the
legislature
did
it
and
not
the
courts.
and
this,
of
course,
is
our
position
here
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
change
in
this
act,
then
the
congress
should
do
it
and
not
the
benefits
review
board,
which
was
constituted
in
1972
by
an
amendment
to
this
act.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
correct,
sir.
the
congress
amended
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
in
1949,
i
believe,
so
that
when
an
employee
had
a
serious
loss
of
arm,
leg,
and
so
forth,
then
he
could
after
he
had
exhausted
the
schedule
come
in
and
show
that
fact.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
1949,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
correct,
on
other
respects.
on
five
different
occasions
the
longshore
act
has
been
amended.
now,
certainly
the
congress
knew
not
only
that
they
had
amended
the
act
in
1949
but
they
again
amended
it
in
19...
i
forget
the
exact
date,
it
may
be
1970
that
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
was
again
amended
to
more
liberalize
the
alternative
position,
to
go
forward
with
a
showing
of
a
greater
loss.
it
was
amended
twice.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
1936,
i
believe.
it's
been
a
long,
long
time.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
sir?
mr.
richard
w.
turner
yes,
sir,
it
was
the
congress
simply
adopted
the
longshore
act
to
be
the
workers'
compensation
act
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
right,
sir.
this
act
was
made
for
longshoremen
and
not
for
piano
players
or
something
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
but
those
are
all
covered
now
because
it
is
applicable
to
all
employers
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
benefits
review
board
when
they
affirmed
the
opinion
of
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case
pulled
themselves
up
by
their
own
bootstraps
by
citing
two
of
their
own
opinions.
they
first
had
decided
a
case
of
mason
against
old
dominion
stevedoring
corporation,
which
is
found
at
1
b.r.b.s.
357.
and
mason
was
a
man
who
injured
his
hand
and
could
no
longer
work
as
a
longshoreman.
in
that
case
an
administrative
law
judge
decided
that
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
a
25
percent
disability
of
the
hand,
that
he
had
a
75
percent
loss
of
earning
capacity
and
gave
it
to
him.
the
board
in
that
case
approved
the
opinion
and
order
of
the
administrative
law
judge
and
said
that
they
were
not
constrained
to
follow
williams
v.
donovan,
which
provided
a
maximum
recovery
where
the
injury
could
be
shown
to
extend
beyond
that
period.
now,
to
support
their
decision
in
the
mason
case,
the
board
cited
american
mutual
insurance
company
against
jones.
now,
that
is
a
district
of
columbia
case
involving,
again,
an
injury
to
a
man's
hand.
but
the
man
was
elderly,
he
was
uneducated,
he
was
untrainable,
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
schedules,
it
was
decided
under
section
8(a)
of
the
act,
which
defines
permanent,
total
disability.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
schedules.
but
they
cited
the
jones
case
as
their
authority
for
disapproving
of
williams
v.
donovan,
which
was
exactly
on
all
fours.
the
other
case
that
the
board
cited
of
their
own
making
was
longo
v.
universal
terminal
and
storing
corporation.
now,
that
was
a
hearing
loss
case
in
which
a
longshoreman
lost
the
hearing
in
one
of
his
ears.
but
because
of
that
he
was
unable
to
go
back
to
longshoring
work.
again
we
were
dealing
with
an
uneducated
man
who
could
do
nothing
else
and
the
stevedoring
company
had
not
provided
him
with
any
other
job,
nor
had
it
shown
that
any
other
job
was
available.
and
therefore
the
administrative
law
judge
decided
that
he
was
permanently,
totally
disabled
and
properly
so.
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
schedule
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
a
scheduled
loss.
he
was
permanently,
totally
disabled.
he
couldn't
work;
he
didn't
have
a
job.
now,
those
two
cases,
as
i
say,
were
the
authority
for
the
alj
in
my
case
and
the
board
itself
in
my
case
deciding
that
the
schedule
was
not
applicable
but
that
the
man
could
obtain
more
compensation
than
called
for
by
the
schedules.
the
schedules,
of
course,
called
for
a
definite
payment
based
on
the
weekly
wage
being
earned
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
and
for
a
definite
period.
the
longshore
act
since
its
adoption
in
1927
has
been
amended
on
several
occasions,
as
before
mentioned.
but
the
"other
case"
provision
in
it
has
never
been
changed.
there
has
always
been
an
"other
case"
provision.
and
certainly
congress
was
aware
of
all
of
the
changes.
now,
if...
no
question
by
anyone
has
been
raised
that
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress
to
promulgate
such
a
statutory
scheme
for
the
compensation
of
workers.
that
power
has
not
been
challenged
since
the
case
of
flamm
v.
hughes,
which
is
329
f2d
378,
a
2nd
circuit
case
in
1964.
the
recent
case
of
bloomer
against
liberty
mutual
decided
by
this
present
court
on
march
3,
1980,
was
decided
on
a
different
issue,
but
the
court
there
held,
if
i
understand
it
correct,
that
the
act
means
what
it
plainly
says.
now,
although
the
act
provides
for
some
elections
or
options
for
both
worker
and
employer,
nowhere
does
the
act
provide
that
a
person
may
or
may
not
take
under
the
schedule.
there
is
no
option
there
written
nor
is
there
any
hint
that
it
would
be.
and
we
submit
that
the
act
in
the
schedules
provides
an
exhaustive
remedy.
it
is
not
a
minimal
remedy,
it
is
not
a
floor.
it
is
an
exhaustive
remedy
for
those
enumerated
injuries
and
that
the
court
below
was
incorrect
when
it
decided
that
it
was
not,
and
we
ask
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
go
to,
be
admitted
back
to
the
administrative
law
judge
for
a
proper
determination
of
the
scheduled
loss
that
this
man
has
sustained.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
correct,
sir.
the
longo
case
was--
mr.
richard
w.
turner
--a
hearing
loss
case.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
that's
correct,
sir.
it
was
incorrectly
decided
because
the
man
had
a
25
percent
disability
of
the
hand,
but
the
administrative
law
judge
decided
that
he
had
75
percent
disability.
and
the
board,
the
appellate
board,
decided
that
that
administrative
law
judge
was
correct
and
that
they
were
not
constrained
to
follow
williams
v.
donovan,
which
is
of
course
a
case
on
all
fours
with
ours
here
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
well,
they
didn't
say
that.
they
said
they
relied
on
the
case
of
american
mutual
insurance
company
against
jones,
which
of
course
was
again
a
total
permanent
disability
and
had
no
bearing
on
the
schedule.
thank
you,
sirs.
mr.
richard
w.
turner
if
i
may,
your
honor,
please?
let
me
first
of
all
call
the
court's
attention
to
at
least
one
of
the
cases
mentioned
by
mr.
scherr,
the
case
of
collins
against
todd
shipyards
corporation,
in
which
the
board
itself
shows
a
very
divided
opinion.
the
chief
judge
smith
of
the
board
has
written
a
bitter
dissent
in
that
case,
so
that
certainly
in
my
humble
judgment
no
court
need
bow
to
the
expertise
of
the
administrative
law
judges
in
a
case
such
as
this,
which
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
now,
they
couldn't
tell
you
how
many
cases
or
how
cases
were
decided
prior
to
this
but
my
own
experience
tells
me
that
thousands
and
thousands
of
cases
were
decided
by
deputy
commissioners
when
there
was
a
dispute
at
the
informal
conference
level;
thousands
of
them
were
decided
and
decided
under
the
schedules.
there
was
never
any
question.
when
it
got
to
the
district,
united
states
district
court,
the
case
was
williams
v.
donovan
and
the
united
states
district
court
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
schedules
were
appropriate
and
were
exclusive.
they
were
mutually
exclusive,
the
schedules
and
the
so-called
"other"
cases
department.
the
schedules
treat
all
persons
the
same;
no
matter
who
he
is
or
how
much
he
earns
the
schedules
are
complete
in
and
of
themselves,
but
it
is
obvious
that
they
could
not
take
into
effect
every
possible
injury
that
a
man
might
suffer
or
a
woman
might
suffer.
i
don't
know
whether
there
are
women
longshoremen
or
not.
it's
not
possible.
they
have
heart
attack
cases,
they
have
brain
injury
cases.
it
is
just
simply
impossible.
there
must
be
a
schedule
to
allow
the
employer
to
have
a
definite
liability
and
to
have
employee
obtain
prompt
and
certain
compensation.
thank
you.
my
time
has
expired.
