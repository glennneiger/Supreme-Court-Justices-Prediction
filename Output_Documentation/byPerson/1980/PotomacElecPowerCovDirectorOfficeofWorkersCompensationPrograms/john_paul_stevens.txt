justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
involves
the
proper
measure
of
compensation
for
a
worker
who's
covered
by
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
that
act
applies
to
employers
in
the
district
of
columbia
by
reason
of
a
special
act
of
congress.
the
employee
involved
in
this
case
suffered
a
severe
injury
to
his
knee
which
was
classified
as
a
permanent
partial
disability.
the
statute
contains
a
schedule
of
compensation
to
be
awarded
for
various
kinds
of
physical
injuries,
one
of
which
is
the
lost
of
the
use
of
a
leg,
and
under
that
schedule
this
employee
is
entitled
to
a
specific
measured
compensation.
his
injury
is
just
partial.
he
re-continues
to
work
but
the
--
the
statutory
scheduled
compensation
is
less
than
he
would
receive
if
he
brought
--
made
his
claim
under
a
provision
that
allows
compensation
for
other
cases,
cases
not
specifically
listed
on
the
--
on
the
schedule
and
he
sought
recovery
as
--
and
other
case
which
would
allow
him
a
substantially
larger
recovery
maybe
by
a
percentage
of
his
lost
of
earnings
and
the
fixed
amount
pursuant
to
the
schedule.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
this
alternative
measure
of
recovery
and
the
question
for
us
to
decide
was
whether
that
was
a
proper
reading
of
the
statute.
as
we
read
the
statute,
the
congress
has
provided
the
other
cases
to
cover
those
which
are
not
on
--
on
the
list
and
not
as
an
alternative
measure
of
recovery
for
those
for
which
is
a
specific
recovery
is
--
is
provided.
for
that
reason,
although
it
may
well
be
true
that
the
statute
is
in
need
of
reexamination
because
it's
a
rather
old
schedule,
we
have
decided
to
reverse
the
judgment
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
explained
our
reasons
in
some
detail
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
justice
blackman
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
