ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
essential
purpose
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
to
compensate
employees
for
disability,
that
is
to
say,
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity.
petitioner
is
contending
in
this
case
that
this
statute
should
be
construed
to
deny
an
employee
who
has
suffered
a
substantial
disability...
that
is
to
say,
a
substantial
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity...
deny
him
the
right
to
recover
compensation
in
proportion
to
that
actual
loss.
construction
urged
by
petitioner
would
also
lead
to
a
number
of
totally
irrational
results,
most
notably
the
right
of
an
employee
judged
to
have
suffered
temporary
partial
disability
to
recover
more
than
a
employee
judged
to
have
suffered
permanent
partial
disability.
because
the
construction
that
petitioner
is
urging
in
this
case
is
thus
counter
to
the
essential
and
central
purpose
of
the
act
and
would
lead
to
results
which
cannot
readily
be
imputed
to
congress,
we
say,
as
this
court
said
in
the
case
of
baltimore
and
philadelphia
steamboat
company
v.
norton,
nothing
less
than
compelling
language
would
justify
such
a
construction
of
the
act,
and
we
don't
think
that
that
compelling
language
is
present
in
this
case.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
don't
think,
we
don't
concede
that
the
plain
language
compels
the
result
that
petitioner
is
urging.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
would
concede
that
perhaps
the
court
equates
the
two.
we
would
say
that
neither
is
present
in
this
case.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
would
say
that
other
cases
mean
simply
cases
not
determined
under
the
schedule,
and
we
would
say
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
enact
a
statute
with
provisions
that
were
contrary
to
its
central
purpose
of
compensating
employees
for
disability,
what
they
would
have
used
was
some
term
such
as
"cases
arising
from
injuries
other
than
those
listed
on
the
schedule.
"
or
some
statement
to
the
effect
that
"this
shall
be
exclusive
of
the
schedule.
"
there's
nothing
there
and
we
just
think
that
this
is
putting
too
much
pressure
on
the
words,
"other
cases".
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
we
would
concede
that
there
are
several
permissible
readings
of
the
term
"other
cases"
here,
and
we
think
in
choosing
between
those
permissible
reasons
you
should
choose
the
reading
that
is
consonant
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
we
believe
that
that's
our
reading
of
"other
cases".
i
think
perhaps
one
thing
i
should
do
here
at
the
outset
is
to
explain
to
the
court
that
there
is
not
an
inconsistency
between
the
approach,
the
way
in
which
we've
briefed
this
issue,
and
the
way
in
which
respondent
mr.
cross
has
briefed
it.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
we
would...
let
me
explain
it
this
way.
we
believe
that
there
is
an
election
here,
so
to
speak.
but
this
is
the
way
we
understand
the
act
to
operate.
the
employee
who
suffers
an
injury
that
is
listed
on
the
schedules
is
permitted
if
he
wishes
to
simply
rest
on
the
schedule.
that
is,
not
to
seek
to
prove
any
loss
of
wage
earnings.
he
can
simply
rest
on
the
schedule,
show
his
impairment,
and
receive
a
benefit
for
that
as
provided
on
the
schedule.
we
believe
that
if
an
employee
understands
that
he
is
going
to
have
disability,
that
is,
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity
in
excess
of
what
is
on
the
schedule,
he
may
then
prove
that
under
8(c)(21).
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
there's
no
inconsistency,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct,
but
i
want
to
explain
one
further
thing
in
the
way
this
would
operate
because
this
explains
why
the
result
that
the
board
has
reached
here
is
not
the
same
as
the
result
that
would
be
reached
under
the
amendment
that
was
rejected
in
the
1972--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
your
honor,
it's
an
"other
case"
because--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
can
but
he
hasn't
sought
to
provide
it.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
if
he
elects
it.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
can
if
he--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--let
me
put
it
this
way:
it's
potentially
double.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it's
potentially
both.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
should
explain
what
we
understand
the
board's
position
to
be,
and
what
certainly
the
position
of
the
director
of
the
office
workers'
compensation
is.
let
us
assume...
i'm
going
to
take
a
hard
case--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well,
i
think
i
should
explain.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
let
us
assume,
taking
a
hard
case
for
us,
that
the
man
has
come
in,
he
has
a
schedule
injury,
and
he
has
no
idea
at
this
point
whether
he's
going
to
have
some
excessive
or
substantial
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity
in
the
future.
he
comes
in
and
he's
awarded
a
schedule
benefit,
let's
say,
50
percent...
arms,
loss
of
use
of
arms...
so
i
think
that's
half
of
312
weeks.
he
is
going
to
be
paid
in
installments.
there's
a
provision
for
being
paid
in
lump
sum
under
section
914(j)
of
the
act
and
that's
in
his
favor
so
he's
going
to
be
paid
in
installments.
the
installments
are
coming
along
and
suddenly
he
discovers
that,
let's
say,
i
can't
work
overtime
any
more,
or
i
have
to
work
part-time,
or
whatever.
under
section
22
of
under
the
act...
this
is
33
u.s.c.
xx,
he
could
come
in
for
a
modification
of
his
award.
you
can
do
that
anytime
prior
to
one
year
from
the
last
payment
by
the
employer,
or
for
one
year
from
the
rejection
of
the
claim.
he
could
come
in
and
say,
i
need
my
award
modified
because
this
is
not
going
to
adequately
compensate
me
for
wage-earning
capacity.
if
there
is
a
hearing
and
the
claims
examiner
and
the
administrative
law
judge
agreed
with
him,
what
they
could
do
then
would
be
to
vacate
the
award
under
the
schedule
and
recalculate
the
award
under
section
8(c)(21).
now,
this
would
not
be
the
same
as
giving
him--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--they'd
give
credit,
they
would--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--he
can't
get
both;
no.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
we
think...
we
just
think
it
has
to
be
read
in
context
and
in
terms
of
the
operation
of--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
big
hurdle
but
not
an
insuperable
one,
we
would
say.
and
again,
we
would
say
that
ours
is
a
permissible
reading
which
is--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--your
honor,
i
should
address
this.
there
are
several
points
to
be
made
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
if...
actually,
until
williams
v.
donovan,
we
know
of
no
situation
in
which
the
case
even
arose,
so
it
can't
be
said
to
have
been
construed
at
all
before
then.
and,
in
williams
v.
donovan,
it
looks
to
us,
reading
the
briefs...
and
we'd
be
willing
to...
well,
i'd
submit
to
the
court
if
the
court
wished...
that
the
only
question
raised
to
the
5th
circuit
was
the
man
was
claiming
permanent
total.
now,
the
5th
circuit
said
in
broad
language,
we
approve
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court,
and
so
the
decision
in
that
sense
can
be
read.
but
other
than
that
decision,
there's
simply
no
other
construction,
there's
no
evidence
that
the
case
ever
arose.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
they
were
decided
by
deputy
commissioners.
and
unfortunately--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well,
unfortunately,
the
labor
department
does
not
have
records,
a
digest
system
of
those,
they
were
little
awards.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
don't
know.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
it
would
have
been
much
rarer
before
19--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well,
it
would
have
been
much
rarer
before
1972
because
before
1972
there
were
total
maximums
on
compensation,
so
that
it
would
have
been
rarer
that
he
would
have
had
much
to
gain
from
going
under...
at
all.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
your
honor,
we--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--we
don't
know;
we
don't
know
that
it
arose.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
ah,
yes.
i
would
like
to
address
that
too,
mr.
justice
stevens.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
that
was
the
sokolowski
case.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
there
wouldn't
be
a
redetermination
of
the
award.
yes.
the
sokolowski
case
tells
us
two
things.
it
was
decided
in
1933,
six
years
after
the
passage
of
the
longshoremen's
act.
it
tells
us
that
in
1933
the
new
york
court
of
appeal
interpreted
other
cases
in
the
way
the
petitioner
is
urging
that
it
be
interpreted
here.
it
also
tells
us
that
in
the
1930
the
new
york
industrial
board,
because
they
were
overturning
an
award
of
the
new
york
industrial
board,
interpreted
it
our
way.
furthermore,
the
sokolowski
opinion
tells
us
that
the
chairman
of
the
board
at
that
time
was
frances
perkins,
who
was
consulted
in
the
course
of
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
now,
unfortunately,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute...
we
combed
it
and
couldn't
find
anything
that
bears
directly
on
this
point,
so
we
don't
know
whether
she
ever
gave
them
her
view
or
whether
her
view
in
1927
was
identical
to
her
view
in
1930.
but
certainly
we
would
think
that
the
sokolowski
case--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--yes,
in
1933.
but
we
would
say
that
the
evidence
of
the
sokolowski,
to
the
extent
that
it
bears
on
the
intent
of
congress
would
help
us
more
than
it
would
help
petitioner.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
and
i
believe
there's
a
difference--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--yes,
your
honor.
and,
again,
i
wouldn't
want
to...
we
simply
don't
know
what
view
the
deputy
commissioners
took
during
these
years
if
they
faced
precisely
this
case.
but
even
if
they
had
taken...
i
should
in
all
candor
admit
that
there's
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief
in
williams
v.
donovan
which
suggests...
it's
sort
of
an
aside...
that
they
might
have
taken
petitioner's
position
here
but
that
wasn't
the
issue
in
the
5th
circuit.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
to
that--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well,
it
wasn't,
that
wasn't
the
issue
in
that
case,
because
they
were
only
talking
about
permanent
tolls.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
the
footnote
is
inconclusive.
it
says
that
the
schedule
and
8(c)21
are
mutually
exclusive.
but
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
white,
that--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
excuse
me?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
i
would
say
as
to
that,
we
don't
have
any
official
ruling
from
the
agency
that
we
know
of
during
that
time,
and
even
if
the
agency,
what
constituted
that
agency
had
taken
a
different
view,
we
would
say
this,
that
an
agency
is
not
disqualified
from
changing
its
mind.
and
if
it
does,
the
court
is
reviewing
the
decision
that's
before
it
and
it
still
does
not
construe
the
statute
de
novo,
it
still
construes
the
statute
in
the
light
of
the
agency's
understanding
of
that
statute.
now,
we
have
consistent
rulings
of
the
benefits
review
board
since
1975
that
this
is
the
way
it
should
be
construed,
and
they're
the
ones
that
have
directly
faced
this
situation.
and
they
have
good
reasons
for
that.
the
irrational
result
that
i've
mentioned;
also,
their...
in
terms
of
a
policy
argument,
i'll
put
here,
because
i
think
this
is
an
answer
to
their
contention
that
this
would
add
to
litigation
under
the
act...
if
a
man's
facing
substantial
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity
with
a
schedule
injury,
he
is
faced
with
the
gross
undercompensation
that
would
result
in
this
case.
mr.
cross
faces
a
loss.
petitioner
says
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
$130,000
under
8(c)(21)
and
that
under
the
schedule
he
would
be
entitled
to
either
$3,000
if
his
disability
is
five
percent
or
$12,000
if
it's
20
percent.
if
a
man
is
faced
with
that
he's
not
going
to
have
the
incentive
to
make
the
effort
to
continue
working
as
mr.
cross
has
done.
mr.
cross
wants
to
work.
what
he's
going
to
have
the
incentive
to
do
is
to
apply
for
permanent
total
disability
under
8(a).
you
don't
have
to
be
bedridden
to
collect
permanent
total
disability.
it's
going
to
be
litigation,
which
should
certainly
offset
any
litigation
increase
that
you
might
get
in
permitting
this
kind
of
litigation
under
8(c)(21).
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no.
the
employer
may
not
do
that.
there
does
not
have
to
be
any
showing
of
rates
or
any
capacity
under
the
statute.
but
that's
not
unfair
because
the
schedule
also
compensates
impairment.
the
man
is
going
to
have
a
lifelong
injury
and
it's
not
unfair
that
he
be
compensated
for
that
as
well
as
any
loss
of
wage-earning
capacity.
he's
also
being
denied
any
tort
suit
or
negligence
suit
he
might
have
against
the
employer,
because
this
is
our
first
remedy.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
--for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
we
think
the
benefits
review
board
correctly
interpreted
the
act
here
and
therefore
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
your
honor.
