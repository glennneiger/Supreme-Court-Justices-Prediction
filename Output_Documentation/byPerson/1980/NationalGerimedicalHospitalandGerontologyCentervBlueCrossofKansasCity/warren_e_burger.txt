we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
national
gerimedical
hospital
v.
blue
cross
of
kansas
city.
mr.
griswold.
chief
justice
burger
isn't
one
of
the
objectives,
mr.
griswold,
to
avoid
the
proliferation
of
unused
beds?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
situation
might
be
different
now
after
the
1980
development?
missouri
now
has
a
planning--
chief
justice
burger
you
wouldn't
think
that,
apparently,
that
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical
enactment
was
a
valid
zoning
ordinance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
griswold.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
burger
where
do
we
put
our
finger
on
that
correctly
here?
chief
justice
burger
fifteen.
now
we'll
try
to
track
with
you.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
greenberg,
suppose...
i'll
try
a
hypothetical...
that
the
federal
government,
the
congress,
developed
the
idea
erroneously
or
otherwise,
that
the
country
needed
more
lawyers,
and
provided
for
$500
million
for
matching
grants
to
the
states
to
build
additional
law
schools
but
required
that
no
grant
would
be
made
to
a
state
unless
the
bar
association
of
that
state
certified
that
there
was
a
need
for
a
law
school
and
specified
the
size
and
capacity
of
that
law
school.
would
you
think
there'd
be
some
analogy
with
what
you've
got
here?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
there
any
analogy
with
respect
to
a
bar
association
being
a
private
entity
as
against
a
governmental
entity,
and
yet
having
in
mind
that
the
bar
association
would
probably
be
about
as
qualified
to
determine
need
for
a
new
law
school
as
anyone
could
possibly
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
griswold,
i
think
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
