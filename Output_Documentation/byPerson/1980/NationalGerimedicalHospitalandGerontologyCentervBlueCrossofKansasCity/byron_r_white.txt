mr.
griswold,
does
the
state
even
now
have
a
statewide
planning
agency?
justice
white
when
did
that
come
into
being?
justice
white
well,
at
the
time
it
applied,
at
the
time
it
sought
an
arrangement
with
blue
cross,
there
was
no
state
backing?
justice
white
and
is
this
legislation
enacted
under
the
spending
power,
this?
justice
white
well,
does
it
involve
federal
money
going
to
the
state?
justice
white
if
a
state
says,
i
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
this,
i
don't
want
to
participate
in
this
program
at
all,
nevertheless,
you
think
the
statute
is
applicable
in
the
state,
in
the
sense
that
the
regional
planning
agency
should
be
formed?
justice
white
well,
it
would
be
if
it
was
under
the
commerce
power.
justice
white
but
they
didn't
intend
it
to
be?
justice
white
is
it
your
position
that
this
regional
planning
agency,
one
of
the
named
coconspirators,
what's...
the
initials
are
too
complicated--
--m-a-h-s-a.
but
is
it
your
position
that
that
agency
had
no
authority
to
operate
under
the
federal
law
at
all
because
the
state
hadn't
chosen
to?
justice
white
even
though
the
state
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
this
at
the
time...
with
the
statute?
justice
white
psychologically
sound.
justice
white
mr.
griswold,
i
take
it
there's
no
provision
or
indication
in
the
federal
law
that
if
blue
cross
had
chosen
to
make
a
contract
with
this
hospital,
despite
the
refusal
of
a
certificate
of
need
from
mahsa,
that
there
would
have
been
no
violation
of
federal
law?
justice
white
well,
assume
it
had,
though.
justice
white
yes,
but
suppose
mahsa
had
refused
to
certify
this,
what
did
it
do
that
led
blue
cross
to
refuse
to
make
the
contract?
justice
white
and
blue
cross
read
it
as
saying,
as
meaning
it
wasn't
needed.
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
what
if
it
had
read
it
as
meaning
that
this
facility
wasn't
needed,
exactly
the
way
it
read
it
now,
but
had
said,
well,
nevertheless,
we're
going
to
make
a
contract
with
the...
that
would
not
have
violated
any
federal
law?
justice
white
it
might
have
made
mahsa
mad
but--
justice
white
well,
it
would
have
resulted
in
cutting
off
funds.
justice
white
nor
would
it
violate
a
federal
law
if
blue
cross
made
a
contract
with
it?
justice
white
but
it
had
no
power
to
require
blue
cross--
justice
white
--and
if
it
talked
the
pharmaceutical
people
into
refusing
to
sell
a
new
hospital
drugs,
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
same
thing?
justice
white
anything
that
mahsa
could
talk
anybody
into
doing,
whether
they
were
required
to
do
it
or
not,
is
exempt.
justice
white
yes,
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
white
it
isn't
even
told
very
specifically
what
to
do.
for
example,
if
mahsa
appeared
at
the
statewide
meeting
of
the
druggists,
the
wholesale
druggists
in
missouri,
and
said,
we
recommend
that
you
all
agree
not
to
sell
this
hospital
any
drugs,
and
they
thought
that
was
a
good
idea
since
they
wanted
to...
so
they
passed
a
resolution,
and
everybody
agreed
that
they
wouldn't
sell
any.
do
you
say
that
that
would
be
exempt
because
mahsa
had
recommend
it,
because
they
were
authorized
to
seek
the
cooperation
of
private
parties?
they
sought
the
cooperation
and
they
got
it.
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
white
well,
is
that
any...
that
certainly
isn't
any
farther
outside
the
scope
of
its
authority
than
going
to
blue
cross,
is
it?
justice
white
only
by
recommending
them.
justice
white
oh,
i
know,
but
they
didn't
have
any
authority
to
bind
anybody.
justice
white
they
could
only
recommend.
justice
white
suppose,
mr.
greenberg,
that
a
state
law
set
up
a
state
health
planning
agency
and
authorized
it
to
make
some
plans
about
hospitals
and
avoid
having
too
many
hospital
beds
and
authorized
it
to
seek
the
cooperation
of
private
interests
in
effecting
its
recommendations.
and
this
state
agency
went
around
to
a
group
of
pharmaceutical
people
and
recommended
that
they
refuse
to
sell
to
a
new
hospital.
now,
certainly,
that
wouldn't
be
within
the
parker
v.
brown
exemption,
would
it?
justice
white
but
you
say
that
precisely
the
same
thing
is
an
implied
exemption
under
this
federal
law?
justice
white
well,
it's
rather
difficult
for
you,
i
would
think.
justice
white
this
was
two
alternative
ways?
justice
white
mr.
greenberg,
suppose
that
mahsa
instead
of
being
what
it
was,
was
blue
cross.
i
suppose,
can't
an
hsa,
it
can
be
any
private
group...
can't
it?
or
a
public
agency?
justice
white
so,
what
if
blue
cross
had
volunteered
to
be
the
hls
or
the...
whatever
it
is...
hsa?
suppose
that...
it
could
have
been,
couldn't
it?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
i
see.
and
only
49
percent,
i
think,
could
be--
justice
white
--i
see.
justice
white
so
you're
saying
this
is
no
different
than
if
the
statute
had
authorized
the
secretary
of
one
of
the
departments
to
go
out
in
the
field
and
try
to
talk
people,
private
parties
into
preventing
excess
hospital
beds,
and
the
secretary
of
health
went
out
to
the
pharmaceutical
convention
and
persuaded
them
not
to
sell
to
the
new
hospital?
justice
white
and
so
you
think,
then,
that
the
pharmaceutical
people,
although
they
weren't
required
to
do
that
at
all,
by
the
federal
law,
and
couldn't
have
been
told
to
do
it
by
the
secretary,
they're
nevertheless
exempt?
justice
white
but
it
would
have
been
no
violation
of
federal
law
if
it
had
done
that?
