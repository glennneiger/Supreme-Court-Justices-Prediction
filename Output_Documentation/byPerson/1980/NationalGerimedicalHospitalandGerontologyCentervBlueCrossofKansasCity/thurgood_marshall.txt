you
can't
tell
the
players
without
a
program.
sixteen,
did
you
say?
justice
marshall
could
they
have
turned
it
over
to
a
subsidiary?
justice
marshall
blue
cross
turn
it
over
to
a
subsidiary
called
the
hospital
opportunists
association?
justice
marshall
would
you
mind,
would
you
mind
meeting
it?
justice
marshall
but
this
is
a
purely
private
organization,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
mahsa.
justice
marshall
is
it
a
public
or
private
organization?
justice
marshall
i
thought
it
was
a
private
organization.
justice
marshall
american
tel
and
tel
is
a
state
incorporated
organization
too,
you
know,
but
is
it
a
private
corporation
or
a
public
corporation?
justice
marshall
is
it
true
that
blue
cross
could
not
have
done
this
without
mahsa,
whatever
this
thing
is?
justice
marshall
could
blue
cross
have
acted
without
mahsa
and
you
still
have
your
same
position?
justice
marshall
so,
is
it
not
true
that
mahsa
is
giving
antitrust
exemptions?
justice
marshall
no,
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
mahsa
did.
justice
marshall
can
i
back
up
a
minute
to
my
mahsa
point?
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
it
wasn't
binding
on
anybody.
justice
marshall
but
aren't
you
trying
to
make
it
binding
on
us?
why
pick
us
out?
justice
marshall
you
say
it
wasn't
binding
on
blue
cross
or
on
anybody
else,
but
we
have
to
take
it.
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
marshall
oh,
you're
back
to
the
28
words?
justice
marshall
if
you
lose
one
of
them,
do
you
lose?
justice
marshall
suppose
you've
only
got
26
of
them?
justice
marshall
if
you
accept
that,
you're
in
a
little
trouble
too.
justice
marshall
if
you
accept
that,
you're
in
a
little
trouble
too,
because
you
said
there
was
no
antitrust
involved.
justice
marshall
no,
no.
i
mean,
when
you're
talking
about
in
1974,
when
the
statute
was
passed,
they
had
no
idea
of
antitrust.
justice
marshall
but
you
now
say
that
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general,
there
were
some,
didn't
you?
justice
marshall
oh,
i
misunderstood
you.
