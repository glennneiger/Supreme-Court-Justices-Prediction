mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
health
planning
act
of
1974
was
deliberately
anticompetitive.
what
congress
did
in
the
statute
itself
was
fashion
health
systems
agencies
throughout
the
nation
and
it
directed
that
each
one
draft
a
plan,
a
plan
which
would
blueprint
the
future
development
and
structure
of
health
systems
in
the
various
communities.
congress
directed
in
the
statutory
words
that
the
agencies
reduce
documented
inefficiencies.
it
was
the
statutory
test...
these
are
words
in
the
statute...
to
prevent
unnecessary
duplication
of
health
resources.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
i
think
that
the
authority
was
generally
under
the
spending
authority.
there
were
grants
made
to
the
states,
rather
substantial
grants
are
made
to
the
states.
it
also--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
lest
there
be
any
doubt,
there
is
no
claim
here
that
there
will
be
a
violation
of
federal
law
if
blue
cross
does
not
go
along.
that
is
not
our
point.
our
point
is
one
of
cooperation,
and
cooperation
within
the
statutory
scheme
established
by
congress
in
order
to
effectuate
a
particular
result.
now,
these
statutory
words
are
very
clear:
planning,
reduce
documented
inefficiencies,
prevent
unnecessary
duplication.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
these
are
words
in
various
sections
of
the
statute.
i'm
going
to
have
the
same--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--i'm
going
to
have
the
same
problem
mr.
justice
rehnquist
had
earlier.
in
300l-(b)(2)(a),
300l-2(a),
and
300l-2(a)(4).
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
says,
"prevent
unnecessary
duplication
of
health
resources.
"
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
300l-2(a)(4).
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
these
statutory
words,
planning--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--in
our
brief
it's
at
page
15.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
fifteen.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
these
are
short
words.
mr.
griswold
seems
concerned
that
there
are
only
28
words
on
which
we
rely.
having
been
trained
in
the
antitrust
laws
i
am
used
to
short
statutes.
there
are
28
words.
these
statutory
words,
words
like
planning,
reduce
documented
inefficiencies,
prevent
unnecessary
duplication,
are
plainly
antithetical
to
all
of
antitrust.
there
could
be
nothing
that
could
be
more
antithetical.
solicitor
general
talks
about
a
promotion
of
competitive
activity.
there
was
no
talk
of
any
kind,
none
whatsoever,
in
the
1974
act,
which
is
the
only
act
before
this
court,
about
competitive
activity.
there's
not
a
whisper
of
it,
not
in
the
legislative
history,
not
in
the
statute.
everything
that
congress
wanted
to
do
in
1974
was
deliberately
anticompetitive.
now,
petitioner's
reply
brief,
at
page
4,
note
1,
relies
on
a
house
report
on
the
1974
act
and
petitioner
argues
that
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
understood,
as
they
put
it,
"planning
to
be
synonymous
with
cartel
regulation.
"
however,
that
same
1974
house
report
at
pages
60
and
61
discusses
the
key
provision
here
with
respect
to
implementation.
words
that
were
in
the
house
bill
at
the
time
that
finally
became
incorporated
in
those
very
same
words
in
the
final
act.
this
is
what
the
house
report
said.
with
your
permission,
i
would
like
to
quote.
"the
planning
done
by
hsas
is
to
include
as
an
integral
part
of
the
planning
process
the
implementation
of
plans.
"
these
are
not
two
separate
activities,
for
the
definition
of
planning
includes
implementation,
not
just
recommending;
not
just
the
american
law
institute,
with
respect.
petitioner
sees
a
difference
between
planning
and
implementation.
the
1974
house
report
on
which
petitioner
relied
did
not.
now,
lest
there
be
any
doubt
here
i
would
like
to
quote
further
from
that
house
report.
it
puts
it
this
way
and
it
makes
very
clear
the
two
track
system
which
congress
had
to
adopt
in
1974,
makes
its
point
this
way.
"the
apparently
modest
initial
means
of
implementing
health
plans
seeking
the
assistance
of
individuals
and
entities
in
the
health
service
area
to
do
so
is
in
fact
the
most
important
method
available.
"
"without
credibility
in
the
community
and
close
working
relationships.
"
--close
working
relationships...
"with
those
who
operate
the
health
system
guided
change
will
be
impossible.
"
then
the
house
report
goes
on,
putting
away
any
lingering
doubt:
"the
governing
body"...
they're
talking
now
about
the
governing
body
of
the
health
systems
agency...
"should
include
representation
of
third
party
payers.
"
--third
party
payers
like
blue
cross...
"who
once
the
plans
are
drawn
can
assist
the
agency
in
implementing
them.
"
these
are
the
words
of
the
congress.
"without
close
working
relationships
with
those
who
operate
the
health
system
guided
change
will
be
impossible.
"
those
are
the
words
of
the
congress
that
wanted
to
repeal
the
antitrust
laws.
it
didn't
say
anything
about
it,
it
didn't
say
anything
about
it
because
in
1974,
if
we
take
that
slice
of
time,
nobody
thought
that
the
antitrust
laws
applied
in
this
business.
it
was
before
rex
hospital,
it
was
before
royal
drug,
it
was
before
goldfarb.
antitrust
was
the
furthest
thing
in
anyone's
mind.
we've
had
the
petitioner,
we've
had
the
solicitor
general,
we
have
an
amicus,
we
have
our
particular
group.
no
one
has
found
a
word
in
the
1974
legislative
history
suggesting
that
anyone
wanted
any
kind
of
antitrust
or
competition.
all
of
the
legislative
history
says,
there
are
too
many
beds,
it's
adding
to
cost.
if
you
build
a
bed
it
gets
filled
up,
and
we
don't
want
it.
the
the
house
report
talks
about
third
party
payers
who
once
the
plans
are
drawn
can
assist
the
agency
in
implementing
them.
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
those
are
facts
which,
with
respect,
are
glossed
over
by
the
petitioner,
and
are
also
glossed
over
by
the
solicitor
general.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
blanket
exemption
here.
what
we're
asking
for
is
an
implied
repeal
with
respect
to
the
very
specific
facts
of
this
very
case.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
with
respect,
sir,
the
certificate
of
need
is
only
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
i
think
it
points
up
what
was
going
on
here.
again--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--that's
absolutely
correct.
and,
indeed,
there
were
no
certificates--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--pardon
me?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
there
could
have
been
a
certificate
of
need
in
missouri.
there
could
have
been
a
certificate
of
need
law
in
missouri.
missouri
did
not
have
one.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
the
scope
of
the
exemption
should
be
related
to
the
facts
of
our
particular
case,
and
the
facts
of
our
case
can
be
ascertained
not
from
statements
of
it
being
certified
by
the
state
of
missouri--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--we
have
specific
facts
here,
and
the
specific
facts
here
are,
according
to
the
complaint,
according
to
the
very
complaint--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--i
think
they
had
in
mind
this
situation,
this
kind
of
situation,
where
the
health
systems--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--i
understand.
and
the
health--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--oh,
no;
oh,
no.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
provided
that...
the
answer
is
yes,
provided
that,
key,
provided
that,
that
the
health
systems
agency,
the
federally
created,
the
federally
funded
agency...
34
this
isn't
some
private
interloper;
it's
supervised
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
provided
that
the
health
systems
agency
had
made
the
prior
determination,
and
the
complaint
here
states
that
what
blue
cross
did
is
it
delegated
to
the
health
systems
agency
the
determination
of
need.
we
don't
have
blue
cross
making
the
decision.
the
decision
here
is
made
by
the
health
systems
agency.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
is
exempt
because
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
have
done.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
a
subsidiary
of
whom?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
i
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
on
these
particular
facts.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
i
think
that
that
would
surely
be
a
broader
exemption
than
is
being
called
for
here
and
might
not
be
covered.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
are
we
talking
about
mahsa
or
blue
cross?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
mahsa
is
not
a
"purely
private
organization".
it
was
created
by
a
federal
statute,
it
is
funded
up
to
90
percent
with
federal
funds,
and
it
is
specifically
regulated
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
on
an
ongoing
basis.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it's
a
state
incorporated
organization.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
is
private
but
federally
funded.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it's
a
private
corporation.
however,
it
is
a
unique
private
corporation
in
that
it
is
federally
funded
and
created
by
federal
statute
and
is
supervised
in
its
entirely
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
in
fact,
it
is--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--it's
authorized,
established.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it
is
not
created.
it
is
actually
incorporated
by
a
state.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
would
be
authorized
only
in
the
event,
only
in
the
event
that
it
was
authorized
by
the
statute
and
in
the
supervision
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
was
determined--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--no,
it
would
not
be
here.
if
mahsa
had
determined,
as
it
did
here,
that
the
number
one
priority
in
the
community
was
to
stop
the
proliferation
of
hospital
beds
and
the
statute
says,
that
it
was
an
unnecessary
duplication
of
health
resources,
so
this
statement
was
clearly
within
the
statutory
authority.
if
in
terms
of
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical
example,
rather
than
going
to
blue
cross
it
went
to
a
group
of
pharmaceutical
suppliers
and
it
said,
don't
supply
them,
congress
intended
that
that
be
impliedly
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
that's
what
at
stake
here.
congress
is
deliberately
anticompetitive.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
that
must
be
faced
up
to.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
no.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
congress
has--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--i
understand.
that's
correct.
it's
a
participation
of
mahsa
in
this
scheme
that
provides
the
antitrust
exemption
as
derived
from
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
deliberately
anticompetitive
and
says,
we
want
to
achieve
the
reduction
of
hospital
beds
in
different
ways.
one
of
the
ways
is
the
cooperative--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--no,
it
doesn't.
it
talks
about--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--reducing...
it
talks
about
reducing
documented
inefficiency
and
it
talks
about
the
unnecessary
duplication
of
health
resources.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
there
are
various
things
at
stake.
there
is
not
a
determination
by
the
congress
that
we
need
absolutely
no
more
hospital
beds
anywhere
in
the
nation.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
or
in
any
specific
place.
because
there
may
be...
and
congress
recognizes
this...
you
may
have
sunbelt
growth,
which
will
require
more
hospital
beds.
the
key
point
here
is
that
in
kansas
city,
in
kansas
city
mahsa
said,
we're
not
in
the
sunbelt,
unfortunately,
we
have
too
many
beds.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
but
congress
said--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--no,
but
what
congress
did
say
is,
we
are
going
to
create
205
health
systems
agencies
and
they're
going
to
determine
within
each
standard
metropolitan
area...
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out,
mahsa
covers
kansas
city,
kansas
and
missouri.
they
wanted
a
true
economic
group.
within
that
economic
area
mahsa
determines
if
you
need
beds.
now,
the
petitioner
complains;
they
said,
well,
they
wouldn't
allow
any
more
beds.
but
the
point
is,
they
didn't
ask,
and
the
mere
fact
that
one
doesn't
ask
or
would
get
a
turn
down
doesn't
mean
there's
no
due
process.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
is
positively
a
recommendation.
it
is
not
binding
on
anyone.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
because
congress
went
further.
congress
said,
they
shall
implement
it.
they
shall
seek
to
implement
the
plans
to
the
extent
practicable
in
the
area.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
no,
it
says,
shall
seek
to
the
extent--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--that
is
correct.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
they
had
no...
but
the
congressional
determination
here
was
that
they
wanted...
there
were
two
tracks,
as
we've
said.
one
of
the
tracks
has
to
do
with
planning
and
implementation,
not
a
requirement
to
be
sure,
planning
and
implementation
in
the
very
route
that
we've
taken
here.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
i
think
not.
the
point,
though,
is--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
i'm
saying
that,
taking
the
parker
v.
brown
determination...
i
think
the
scope
of
parker
v.
brown
at
this
point
is
in
enough
difficulty...
in
terms
of
implied--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--i
understand.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
isn't,
it
isn't.
it
is
positively
not
a
parker
v.
brown--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--we
agree.
the
point
that
we
make
is,
the
issue
before
the
court,
with
respect,
is
to
take
the
slice
of
time
in
1974
and
say,
what
did
that
congress
that
passed
the
national
health
planning
act
of
1974
intend
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
laws?
and
we
think
that
by
reading
the
entire
statute
and
not
just
what
is
here
irrelevant,
section
"m",
a
different
section
from
what's
involved,
but
rather
if
one
reads
the
statutory
purposes
in
the
"l"
sections
that
have
to
do
with
our
case,
the
health
systems
agency
and
the
implementation,
that
congress
said,
we
want
to
do
it
two
ways.
why
did
they
say
they
wanted
to
do
it
two
ways?
the
reason
was,
again,
taking
the
slice
of
time
in
1974,
the
states
didn't
have
certificate
of
need
statutes
yet.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that's
correct.
two...
and
that's
what
the
house
report
makes
very
explicit
and
i
think
is
very
clear
from
the
statute,
and
is
also
clear
from
the
senate
report.
in
1974
congress
said,
let's
get
on
with
it,
let's
stop
this
proliferation
of
hospital
beds,
but
we
can't
force
states
to
go
enact
certificate
of
need
laws,
and
they
gave
them
four
years
to
do
so.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
with
respect--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--that's
correct,
but
i
say
that
that's
what
congress
said
in
the
1974
act
in
the
28
words.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
oh,
yes;
oh,
yes.
there's
no
doubt
about
those
28
words
being
the
basis
of
our
position.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
depends...
well,
let
me
do
something.
one
of
the
words
that
the
petitioner
is
very
interested
in
is
"to
the
extent
practicable".
to
the
extent
practicable.
and
what
petitioner
does
in
its
brief
is
it
incorporates
a
lot
of
baggage
on
top
of
"to
the
extent
practicable".
it
says,
what
"to
the
extent
practicable"
congress
meant
was,
except
insofar
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned.
well,
let
me
read
from
another
section
of
the
law,
the
1974
law
now,
42
u.s.
code
300-1(a)(2),
which
is
not
in
any
of
the
briefs
at
this
point.
but
it
says
that,
"to
the
extent
practicable
the
area
shall
include
at
least
one
center
for
the
provision
of
highly
specialized
health
services.
"
what
congress
is
talking
about
there
is
how
big
the
health
systems
agency
can
be.
it
couldn't
be
clearer
if
one
reads
the
entire
act
that
"to
the
extent
practicable"
means
what
it
means
to
everyone:
if
you
can
do
it,
and
not
insofar
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
violated.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
can
be
any
particular
entity.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
because
the
hsa
had
to
have
as
its
governing
body--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--providers.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
and
it
had
to
have
a
majority
of
consumers.
and
the
staff
had
to
be
funded
by...
all
the
staff
was
funded,
at
least
90
percent
were,
by
the
federal
government.
the
problem
the
petitioner
has
is
that
mahsa
doesn't
look
exactly
like
the
sec.
it
isn't
composed
only
of
federal
employees.
but
what
it
had
on
it
was
volunteers,
all
volunteers...
in
this
case
30
volunteers,
16
of
them
consumers
coming
out
of
the
plain
old
people,
16
being
consumers
and
14
being
providers,
hospitals,
blue
cross,
doctors,
nurses,
professors,
what
have
you.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that
is
what
congress
wanted.
that's
what
it
said.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
with
respect,
no.
because
wholly
apart
from
the
problem
of
hospitals
and
too
many
lawyers...
i'd
rather
not
get
into
that...
the
point
here
is
that
your
analogy
relates
to
the
certificate
of
need
arrangement
insofar
as
the
states
are
concerned.
what's
going
on
here
was
that
there
already
were
a
number
of
certificate
of
need
programs
in
essay.
not
in
missouri,
to
be
sure,
and
congress
in
1974
didn't
want
to
foul
up
that
arrangement
in
the
various
states.
it
was
very
sensitive
to
those
certificate
of
need
arrangements
that
have
been
adopted
in
a
number
of
states.
what
it
wanted
to
do
was
to
get
all
the
other
states
to
adopt
certificate
of
need
legislation
and
in
fact
that's
what
happened.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
if
what
congress
did,
as
i
said,
we
will
establish
you
and
we
want
you
to
go
this
route,
bar
associations,
and
we're
going
to
supervise
you...
which
were
the
facts
here...
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
then
you
would
have
an
analogy
to
what
we
have
here.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
oh,
yes.
that's
another
factor
here.
in
other
words,
what
mr.
justice
stewart
is
emphasizing--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--here,
is
all
of
the
other
baggage
around
it.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
this
was
what
congress
said.
and
what
congress--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--i
think
it
does
say
it
in
those
words,
because
it
says,
they
shall
have
planning,
they
shall
have
documents,
and
they
shall
seek
to
implement
it.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
no,
congress
does
not
say
that,
because
what--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--no,
because
what
congress
wanted
here
was
cooperation.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
well,
what
congress
is
saying
is,
that
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
hospital
industry...
which
is
the
wrong
word;
remember
that
back
in
1974,
virtually
all
hospitals
were
nonprofit
hospitals,
they
were
nonprofit
hospitals
with
boards
of
governors
composed
of
distinguished
members
of
the
community,
and
what
was
intended
here,
the
whole
theory
was,
we
need
cooperation
from
people
like
this.
and
the
way
to
get
cooperation
from
them
was
not,
in
mr.
justice
white's
words,
to
say,
you've
got
to
do
it,
but
to
get
them
into
the
act.
congress
says
in
the
findings,
it's
imperative
that
providers
be
involved
in
this.
it's
imperative
that
providers
be
on
the
boards.
whoever
heard
of
a
congress
interested
in
antitrust
laws
saying
a
bunch
of
competitors
have
to
get
together
and
make
plans?
this
was
a
field
of
hospitals,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
prior
fact
situations
which
have
been
before
this
court.
they
don't
resemble
industry,
they
don't
resemble
regulated
industries.
it's
just
a
different
sort
of
thing.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
well,
what
was
blue
cross
supposed
to
do
in
this
situation?
here
they
had
been
part
of
the
mahsa
as
congress
said
they
should
be,
they
helped
to
create
the
plan,
the
plan
says
the
number
one
priority
in
the
area
is
the
elimination
of
excess
capacity,
the
number
one
priority.
blue
cross
then
delegates,
according
to
the
complaint,
blue
cross
has
delegated
its
certificate
of
need
position
to
mahsa.
blue
cross
then
said
to
mahsa...
or
says
to
the
petitioner,
the
sole
exclusive
reason
we're
turning
you
down...
that's
what
the
complaint
says,
the
sole
and
exclusive
reason
we're
turning
you
down
is
because
mahsa
has
not
said
you
need
it.
what
was
blue
cross
supposed
to
do
in
that
situation,
then?
say,
okay,
petitioner,
we'll
go
along
with
you?
now,
i
should
point
out
that--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--that's
correct.
i'd
rather
not
get
into
that
but
for
present
purposes,
obviously,
we're
assuming
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
otherwise
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
point.
in
its
reply
brief
petitioner
states
that
all
involved
in
1979
would
have
been
quite
surprised
to
hear
that
congress
had
already
impliedly
repealed
the
antitrust
laws.
nevertheless,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
amicus
brief
states
unequivocally
at
page
16,
note
11...
i'd
like
to
quote:
"to
be
sure,
there
are
some
activities
that
must.
"
--must...
"by
implication
be
immune
from
antitrust
attack,
if
hsas
and
state
agencies
are
to
exercise
their
authorized
powers.
"
so
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
there
would
be
repeal
of
antitrust
by
implication
when
private
parties
assist
the
hsas
in
developing
plans.
but
that's
not
all.
the
solicitor
general
goes
on:
"there
may
be
occasions
in
implementing.
"
--note,
he
uses
the
word
"implementing"
and
not
just
"recommending"...
"in
implementing
health
systems
plans
when
an
implied
exemption
might
be
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
statutory
scheme
as
required
by
congress.
"
in
a
word,
what
the
solicitor
is
conceding
here
is
that
there's
room
for
a
narrow,
implied
exemption
from
antitrust.
we
say
that
the
limited
facts
on
the
record
before
this
court,
not
a
blanket
exemption,
not
somebody
who's
interested
in
goals
and
goes
along
and
does
things
on
their
own,
but
on
the
limited
facts
here,
we
have
the
agency
making
a
determination
to
avoid
excess
capacity,
which
it
calls
the
number
one
priority
for
implementation;
where
according
to
the
complaint
blue
cross
designated
the
health
systems
agency
as
the
agency
to
conduct
need
review;
and
the
hearing
of
the
agency,
the
solicitor
general
says
at
page
16,
note
11,
was
public
and
open
and
carefully
supervised.
not
some
private
interloper;
public
and
open
and
carefully
supervised,
and
the
solicitor
general
is
correct.
now,
it
should
also
be
emphasized
that
once
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
there
is
repeal
of
antitrust
by
implication
in
some
cases,
this
demolishes
the
rationale
of
the
expressio
unius
argument.
expressio
unius
means
that
if
we
said
one
thing,
then
everything
else
is
out.
now,
this--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--pardon
me?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
i
said
there
was
no
antitrust
involved
on
the
specific
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
no,
no,
no.
excuse
me?
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying,
the
solicitor
general
is
acknowledging
that
there
was
some
implied
repeal.
what
we're
saying
is,
we
obviously
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
as
to
where
on
the
line
that
should
be
cut,
but
once
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges
that
there's
some
implied
repeal,
it's
the
end
of
the
expressio
unius
argument.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
it
would
have
been
encouraging
another
120
unnecessary
beds
in
the
community,
which
would
add
to
costs,
which
would
add
to
possible
morbidity,
mortality,
and
all
of
the
other
things
that
mahsa
and
most
particularly
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
found
in
the
statute
in
1974
and
throughout
the
legislative
history.
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
that's
correct.
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
at
this
time
there
is
a
certificate
of
need
legislation
in
missouri.
missouri
for
present
purposes
is
the
49th
state
to
have
certificate
of
need
legislation.
only
louisiana
has
held
out,
having
before
it
the
carrots
of
substantial
federal
funds.
the
four
years
are
up.
so
what
happens
now
is,
the
certificate
of
need
legislation
takes
over,
and
the
other
course,
what
the
house
report,
house
report
1382
said,
in
1974,
the
apparently
modest
initial
means
of
implementing
now
is
no
longer
so
important
because
now
we
have
certificate
of
needs
in
the
49
states
and
just
can't
get
to
build
a
hospital.
once--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--it
varies.
each
state
is
a
little
different
and--
mr.
joshua
f.
greenberg
--it's
hard
enough
going
through
the
'74
and
'79
acts.
each
state
is
a
little
different,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
what's
happened
today
is
that
the
building
of
hospital
beds
is
now
a
state
deal,
except
in
louisiana;
as
it
is
in
missouri.
now,
the
petitioner
says,
well,
missouri
has
approved
my
hospital,
they've
approved
my
hospital.
they've
done
no
such
thing.
what
they've
done
is
they
grandfathered
it.
they've
grandfathered
it
in
missouri
statute
197.345,
having
in
mind
the
problems
of
retroactivity.
the
petitioner
goes
outside
the
record
in
pointing
out
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
contract
at
the
present
time
with
blue
cross
or
not
is
not
in
the
record.
what
is
also
not
in
the
record
is
whether
or
not
petitioner
has
asked
blue
cross
for
a
contract.
it
is
very
dangerous,
as
this
court
well
knows,
to
go
outside
records.
i
don't
know
the
answer,
and
i
don't
know
if
petitioner
does
at
this
point.
and
in
any
event,
it's
not
in
this
record,
which
cuts
off
in
1978,
before
the
1979
act
and
before
the
missouri
certificate
of
need
legislation.
the
petitioner's
counsel
talks
about
judicial
review.
and
the
solicitor
general
has
made
an
argument
in
its
brief
at
various
points,
stating
that
the
health
planning
act
specifically
provides
for
judicial
review
of
state
certificate
of
need
determinations
in
state
court,
and
that
there
is
no
similar
statutory
provision
for
judicial
review
of
health
systems
agency
determinations.
the
premise
of
the
solicitor
general
is
wrong.
the
citations
at
pages
9,
15,
and
24
of
the
brief
are
all
to
the
1979
act,
not
to
the
1974
act,
which
is
the
only
act
involved
here.
there
was
no
provision
in
the
1974
act
with
respect
to
judicial
review
of
state
certificate
of
need
provisions,
so
that
particular
foundation
falls
apart.
also
overlooked
here
is
the
fact
that
the
health
systems
agencies
are
directly
answerable
to
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services,
and
their
health
systems
plans
are
subject
to
review
by
the
secretary
to
assure
that
they
conform
to
national
guidelines
on
such
things
as
hospital
beds
per
capita
and
very
relevant
provision.
if
the
secretary's
review
is
unsatisfactory
to
any
affected
person,
that
person
may
then
seek
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now,
throughout
here,
the
problem
that
petitioner
has
is
it
never
asked
anyone
to
do
anything.
it
never
went
to
mahsa,
it
never
said,
do
you
know,
we
have
not
an
acute
care
hospital,
we
just
take
care
of
the
elderly?
and
maybe
your
determination
with
respect
to
acute
care
hospitals
is
wrong.
in
its
complaint
it
says
it
was
very
special.
it
was
going
to
be
a
national
hospital
for
the
elderly.
they
also
possibly
could
have
gone
to
mahsa
and
said,
well,
this
little
suburb
of
lee's
summit,
where
we're
going
to
build
our
hospital,
they
really
need
a
hospital
there,
they
really
do.
and
therefore
you
ought
to
give
us,
you
ought
to
say,
there's
enough
beds,
but
we
need
another
120-bed
hospital
up
there
in
lee's
summit.
it
didn't
do
any
of
those
things.
the
fact
that
petitioner
doesn't
ask
doesn't
eliminate
the
capacity
to
ask,
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
fact
that
there
was
complete
due
process
in
terms
of
the
promulgation
of
the
plan
and
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
fact
this
is
not
like
silver,
it
bears
no
resemblance
to
silver.
in
this
situation
the
petitioner
could
have
gone
to
mahsa,
it
could
have
asked...
it
might
have
been
turned
down,
but
that
doesn't
eliminate
the
due
process...
and
then
it
could
have
gone
up
through
the
secretary
and
then
into
court.
particularly
here,
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
there
was
only
a
conditional
designation
of
the
health
systems
agency,
a
conditional
designation
meant
there
was
a
90-day
contract.
there
were
contracts
between
the
secretary,
mr.
law,
between
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
the
mahsa.
and
a
contract
meant
money
followed
after
you
signed
your
contract.
that
contract
was
cancellable
in
90
days.
petitioner
could
have
gone
to
the
secretary
and
said,
along
the
lines
of,
cancel
that
contract,
give
them
90
days
notice,
cancel
them,
because
there's
a
desperate
need
for
a
hospital
here.
there
isn't
any
need
for
the
hospital;
there's
no
such
thing.
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
quotes
very
extensively
at
page
10
from
undersecretary
hale
champion.
if
one
reads
what
is
said
there,
it
is
quite
clear
that
mr.
champion
in
that
slice
of
time
said,
there
is
indeed
implied
repeal
from
antitrust
laws
in
some
situations;
this
is
what
he
says.
the
concern
is
misplaced.
if
the
agency
itself
considers
the
questions
and
makes
the
decisions
based
on
an
institutions's
specific
kind
of
data,
then
we
don't
think,
we
don't
think
there
are
any
antitrust
questions
involved.
then
he
goes
on...
i'll
come
back
to
the
next
paragraph
in
a
moment...
then
he
says,
"i
think
in
some
cases
there
has
been
an
effort
to
make
people
more
worried
about
that
subject
than
they
ought
to
be.
"
"that's
our
present
view.
"
the
place
where
mr.
champion
has
a
problem
is
that
the
agency
delegates
the
responsibility.
that
turns
the
facts
in
our
case
topsy
turvy.
the
agency
didn't
delegate
the
responsibility
to
blue
cross.
blue
cross,
according
to
the
complaint
here,
delegated
to
the
health
systems
agency.
now,
we're
told
by
petitioner,
that
the
agency
administering
the
planning
act
had
a
specific
interpretation
and
had
it
obviously
escaped
their
attention
that
there
was
any
implied
repeal?
with
respect,
petitioner
has
a
very
short
memory.
in
the
brief
of
respondent,
blue
cross
of
kansas
city,
in
reply
to
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae,
there's
a
letter
from
secretary
harris
to
attorney
general
civiletti,
and
at
page
5
secretary
harris
says,
"both
the
district
court
and
the
8th
circuit
held
that
the
act
provides
an
implied
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
for
blue
cross
conduct
and
accordingly
dismissed
the
complaint.
"
"this
is
consistent
with
this
department's
legal
interpretation
of
the
act
and
our
policy
for
the
implementation
of
the
act.
"
just
as
does
the
petitioner,
we
turn
to
the
agency
administering
the
planning
act
for
guidance
as
of
that
period
of
time.
to
conclude,
the
plain
repugnancy
of
the
health
planning
act
of
1974
and
the
antitrust
laws
is
illuminated
by
the
very
discrete
facts
of
this
case.
we
submit
that
in
1974...
in
1974,
now...
congress
did
not
intend
to
visit
possible
antitrust
liability
on
blue
cross
for
cooperating
with
the
local
health
systems
agency
to
implement
that
agency's
plan,
which
found
that
excess
hospital
beds
were
leading
to
high
financial
cost
for
the
community,
not
to
speak
of
increased
morbidity
and
mortality.
no
rational
congress
would
direct
a
health
systems
agency
to
seek
to
implement
a
plan
with
the
assistance
of
providers,
providers
like
blue
cross...
stated
to
be
a
provider
in
the
statute...
and
then
to
intend
to
leave
those
providers
exposed
to
possible
antitrust
treble
damages
because
it
furnished
the
assistance
to
the
health
systems
agency.
thank
you.
