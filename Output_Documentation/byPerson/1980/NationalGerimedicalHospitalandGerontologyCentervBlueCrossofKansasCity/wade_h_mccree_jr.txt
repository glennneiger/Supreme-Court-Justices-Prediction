mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statutory
scheme
that
mr.
griswold
described
resulted
in,
of
course,
the
8th
circuit
determining
that
there
was
an
implied
exemption
created
by
this
national
health
planning
and
resources
development
statute
from
the
impact
of
the
antitrust
laws,
because
there
was
a
repugnancy
between
the
statute,
which
was
enacted
subsequent
to
the
antitrust
laws,
which
of
course
have
been
fundamental
laws
in
this
country
since
1980,
at
least
the
sherman
antitrust
act
has.
we
do
not
contend
that
there
can
never
be
implied
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws,
but
we
are
mindful
that
the
teachings
of
this
court
are
that
an
implication
from,
an
implied
exemption
from
a
regulatory
statute
is
strongly
disfavored
and
would
be
found
only
in
cases
of
a
plain
repugnancy
between
the
antitrust
acts
and
the
regulatory
provisions.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
it
may
well
be,
perhaps,
just
because
of
their
age
and
their
fundamental
nature.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
decide
that
here.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
just
don't
think
we
have
to
decide
that
here.
i
think
the
principles
would
be
the
same.
if
the
congress
has
enacted
a
comprehensive
scheme
and
then
enacts
subsequent
legislation,
if
there
is
a
conflict
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
to
try
to
give
meaning
to
both
statutes.
and
if
the
court
cannot
give
meaning
to
both
statutes
because
of
a
plain
repugnancy,
then
it
will
find
that
the
later
statute
pro
tanto,
by
implication,
modified
the
earlier
one.
and
so
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
for
the
problem
of
statutory
construction
whether
we're
talking
about
the
logan
act
or
the
sherman
act
or
capper-volstead,
or
whatever
it
is.
we
contend
here
that
there
is
no
plain
repugnancy,
and
that
this
court's
attention
to
this
matter
can
really
be
concluded
at
that
point.
the
joint
appendix
contains,
of
course,
the
opinion
of
the
8th
circuit,
which
adopts,
after
making
its
own
ascertainment
of
repugnancy,
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
page
187a
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
the
sentence
just
before
the
paragraph
break
about
a
quarter
of
a
page
down,
and
with
leave
of
the
court
i'd
like
to
read
that
sentence
if
i
may.
the
district
judge
wrote,
"if
the
court
were
to
find
that
private
business
working
in
conjunction
with
a
health
systems
agency
established
by
the
act
in
their
area
to
achieve
the
goals
of
the
act
were
liable
or
might
be
liable
under
the
antitrust
law
for
their
actions,
then
the
court
believes
that
the
accomplishment
of
the
purpose
of
the
goals
of
the
act
would
be
effectively
foreclosed.
"
now,
that's
as
close
as
either
of
these
courts
gets
to
the
finding
of
a
plain
repugnancy,
and
yet
on
several
occasions
this
court
has
held
that
activities
which
come
clearly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
regulatory
agency
nevertheless
may
be
subject
to
scrutiny
under
the
antitrust
laws.
as
mr.
griswold
has
pointed
out,
the
national
health
planning
and
resource
development
act
of
1974,
which
is
the
basic
piece
of
legislation
here,
created
two
types,
at
least
two
types
of
agencies;
one,
the
health
systems
agency,
of
which
mahsa,
the
mid-america
health
systems
agency...
which
was,
incidentally,
a
multistate
agency...
is
one;
and
it
created
the
state
agency,
or
authorized
the
creation
of
a
state
agency
which,
as
he
pointed
out,
didn't
exist
at
this
time.
all
the
first
type
of
agency,
the
health
systems
agency,
could
do
is
plan
and
recommend.
it
could
do
nothing
more
than
plan
and
recommend.
and
the
district
court,
and
subsequently
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit,
found
that
respondent
here,
who
is
accused
of
having
conspired
with
mahsa
and
others
to
prevent
the
entry
of
petitioner
into
a
hospital
agreement,
to
prevent
petitioner
and
blue
cross
from
entering
into
an
agreement,
somehow
violated
a
regulatory
scheme
with
a
clear
and
plain
repugnancy.
and
that
just
isn't
so.
because
all
the
act
required
was
cooperation
with
the
health
systems
agency,
and
if
a
private
party
like
blue
cross
in
this
case
is
immune
from
the
antitrust
acts,
just
because
it
does
what
it
thinks
a
health
planning
agency
would
like
it
to
do,
and
at
that
point
the
approval
of
this
court,
we've
moved
a
long
way
from
cases
like
united
states
v.
rca,
california
v.
fpc,
u.s.
v.
borden
company,
silver
v.
new
york
stock
exchange,
where
there
was
strict
regulation
by
an
agency,
and
yet
the
court
found
a
place
for
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
contend
that
in
the
absence
of
a
strict
repugnancy
the
court
can
conclude
its
consideration
of
this
matter
here,
because
there
isn't
any
repugnancy
between
the
activities
of
the
health
systems
agency
and
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
latter,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
went
to
the
8th
circuit
was
on
summary
judgment
and
the
court
assumed
it
to
be
true
that
this
was
a
wrongful
refusal
to
deal
in
violation
of
sections
1
and
2.
and
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
if
this
court
agrees
that
there
is
no
implied
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
to
see
whether
petitioner
can
actually
establish
it.
but
we
have
to
accept
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
first
let
me
say
that
i'm
not
altogether
clear
either
in
my
understanding
of
it,
but
it
is
not,
it
is
not
a
compulsion
of
the
federal
government,
which
was
part
of
mr.
justice
stevens'
inquiry,
because
it
can
only
be
accomplished
by
a
state
agency
which
was
not
in
place
at
the
relevant
time
of
the
refusal,
alleged
refusal
to
deal
here,
but
it
has
since
come
into
being.
it
would
be
a
refusal
by
the
state,
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
possibly
to
accredit
it,
to
permit
it
to
perform.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
federal
law
that
it
would
violate.
my
answer
is
no;
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that
too.
i
know
of
no
federal
law
that
would
violate.
but
we're
in
an
area
here
where
it's
necessary
to
determine
whether
congress
intended
by
implication
to
exempt
certain
private
activity
which
is
to
be
totally
unregulated
from
the
impact
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
we
submit
that
this
court
has
never
done
that.
i
can't
think
of
a
single
instance
where
this
court
by
implication
has
found
that
the
congress
by
implication
meant
to
enable
a
private
party
to
do
the
things
forbidden
by
the
antitrust
acts
when
there
was
no
other
regulatory
scheme
imposed
to
promote
competitive
activity.
and
we
say
it's
particularly,
the
error
is
particularly
egregious
here
because
in
this
national
health
planning
act
the
congress
made
express
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
did
not
exempt
the
behavior
condemned
here.
it
expressly
in
1974
exempted,
or
immunized,
and
in
a
qualified
way,
too,
because
it
was
for
good
faith
and
nonnegligent
activity,
individuals
who
would
participate
in
a
health
systems
planning
activity
from
money
damages
only,
and
not
from
injunctive
relief.
subsequently,
in
1979,
it
extended
the
immunity,
again
just
for
money
damages,
to
the
health
systems
agencies
and
specifically
rejected
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
senate
to
immunize
persons
who
might
cooperate
with
them,
which
would
have
been,
possibly,
blue
cross
in
this
instance.
and
we
set
these
matters
out
on
pages
25
through
27
in
the
government's
brief,
and
we
say
that
where
there
is
an
express
exemption
this
court
should
be
reluctant
to
find
an
implied
blanket
exemption
which
would
be
broader
than
the
qualified
exemption
expressly
made
by
the
congress.
we
think
that
the
congress
was
certainly
concerned
with
delivering
quality
health
services
at
reasonable
cost
to
the
american
people,
but
that
it
did
not
intend
it
to
be
done
in
disregard
of
the
antitrust
laws,
that
it
intended
the
antitrust
laws
to
coexist
except
to
the
extent
that
it
made
express
exceptions
with
its
planning
system,
which
is
set
out
in
the
statute
that
mr.
griswold
described
in
his
argument
to
the
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
will
rest
on
our
brief.
thank
you.
