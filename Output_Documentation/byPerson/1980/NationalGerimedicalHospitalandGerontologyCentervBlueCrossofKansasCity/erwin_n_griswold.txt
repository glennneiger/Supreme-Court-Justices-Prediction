mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
antitrust
case
in
the
health
care
area.
the
issue
turns
on
the
construction
of
the
national
health
planning
and
resource
development
act
of
1974.
no
constitutional
question
is
involved.
the
statute
is
long
and
diffuse.
the
respondents
rely
on
28
fairly
general
words
in
the
statute
as
the
basis
for
their
contention
that
they
have
implied
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
we
contend
that
there
is
no
room
for
such
a
construction.
the
district
court
accepted
the
implied
immunity
argument
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
respondents.
that
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
decision.
the
question
arises
on
these
facts.
national
gerimedical
hospital
is
a
fully
accredited
general
acute
care
community
hospital
which
opened
in
october,
1978.
it
has
been
continuously
licensed
by
the
missouri
division
of
health,
that
is,
the
state
agency,
since
september,
1977,
and
has
been
fully
certified
for
medicare
and
medicaid
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services,
as
it
now
is,
since
its
opening.
it
did
not
receive
a
certificate
of
need
from
any
missouri
state
agency
because
missouri
had
no
certificate
of
need
requirement,
when
it
was
built.
the
respondents
are
blue
cross
of
kansas
city
and
blue
cross
association,
both
of
which
market
and
sell
prepaid
health
reimbursement
plans
to
the
public
and
make
contracts
with
health
care
providers
to
administer
the
plans.
several
other
persons
are
also
named
as
nondefendant
coconspirators.
prior
to
its
opening
the
petitioner
sought
to
make
a
participating
agreement
with
blue
cross.
a
participating
hospital
receives
direct
reimbursement
of
100
percent
for
covered
services
rendered
to
individual
blue
cross
members.
if
the
hospital
is
not
granted
participation,
then
blue
cross
pays
no
more
than
80
percent
of
the
cost
of
the
services
and
it
makes
the
payment
directly
to
the
subscriber
and
not
to
the
hospital.
a
lack
of
participating
hospital
status
discourages
blue
cross
subscribers
and
their
doctors
from
seeking
service
at
national
gerimedical
and
places
the
hospital
at
a
substantial
competitive
disadvantage.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
may
or
may
not
be
the
case.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
any
statutory
authorization,
state
or
federal,
for
restricting
the
construction
of
this
hospital.
and
it
is,
as
i
have
said,
missouri
had
no
certificate
of
need
legislation
at
the
relevant
time
here.
there
was
nothing
illegal
or
inappropriate
about
the
building
of
this
hospital,
and
the
question
really
is
whether
congress
by
passing
this
statute
has
authorized
private
groups
to
enforce
that
approach
to
the
question
of
the
cost
of
medical
care
which
you
have
suggested,
and
our
position
is
that
congress
has
made
no
such
authorization.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes.
the
state
now
has
a
statewide
planning
agency.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
effective
october,
1980.
and
under
it
national
gerimedical
hospital
is
deemed
to
be
a
covered
hospital,
and--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--there
was
no
missouri
statute
restricting--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--i
would
guess
it
would
be
under
the
commerce
power.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
states
are
encouraged
by
the
statute
to
have
a
state
health
planning
and
development
agency
which
would
have
power
to
grant
certificates
of
need,
but
the
states
are
not
required
to
have
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
the
contrary,
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
not
applicable
in
the
state
unless
the--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--unless
the
state...
well,
it
would
be
that
the
power
of
congress
might
be
under
the--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--but
they
didn't
intend
it
to,
and
i
didn't
quite
complete
my
answer,
which
is
that
there
is
a
paragraph
in
the
statute
which
says
that
if
the
state
doesn't
choose
to
have
a
state
agency,
then
it
will
not
get
certain
grants.
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
state
take
those
grants,
and
missouri
deliberately
chose
not
to
take
those
grants
and
chose
not
to
have
a
state
planning
agency.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
had
authority
to
operate
under
the
federal
law
for
the
purpose
of
making
plans
and
recommendations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
little
like
the
american
law
institute
which
proposes
a
federal
securities
code.
the
federal
securities
code
has
no
significance,
no
meaning,
no
binding
effect,
unless
congress
chooses
to
enact
it.
congress
has
not
so
far
chosen
to
enact
it.
there
are
two
groups
under
the
statute,
health
systems
agencies,
and
in
this
case
that
is
the
lower
group.
in
this
case
the
health
systems
agency
was
a
purely
private,
nongovernmental
organization.
the
statute
also
provides
that
there
can
be,
if
the
state
wants,
a
state
health
planning
and
development
agency,
which
is
required
to
be
an
agency
of
state
government
and
which
is
required
to
have
governmental
powers
with
provision
for
due
process
in
the
exercise
of
those
powers,
and
with
provision
for
court
review
of
its
decisions.
the
state
is
not
required
to
have
such
an
agency
and
during
the
relevant
period
here
missouri
had
no
such
agency.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that.
it
is
a...
it
turns
very
heavily
on
what
the
state
wants
to
make
it.
the
state
can
provide
that
there
can
be
no
construction
without
a
certificate
of
need,
and
then
with
proper
due
process
and
proper
procedure
for
appellate
review,
that
can
be
binding
and
can
be
enforced
in
the
state,
in
the
courts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
the
reason
for
having
a
certificate
of
need
statute,
but
missouri
didn't
have
one
and
chose
not
to
have
one.
congress
provided
that
there
could
be
agencies
in
states
which
would
have
certificate
of
need
power,
that
the
secretary
could
make
contracts
with
them,
and
if
the
secretary
did
make
contracts
with
them,
then
the
states
would
be
eligible
for
certain
federal
funds.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
missouri
now
has
a
planning,
but
it
also
has
a
statute
which
says
that
national
gerimedical
shall
be
deemed
to
have
a
certificate
of
need.
and
yet
blue
cross
still
refuses
to
accept
it
as
a
participating
hospital.
now,
the
refusal
of
blue
cross
appears
in
record
on
page
169,
the
letter
from
blue
cross
to
national
gerimedical,
"after
deliberation
the
board
of
trustees
voted
unanimously
at
the
blue
cross
board
meeting
of
march
21
to
deny
blue
cross
member
hospital
status
to
the
national
gerimedical
hospital
because
your
institution
did
not
receive
approval
through
the
health
planning
process.
"
and
i
repeat
that
that
health
planning
process
to
which
reference
was
made
was
that
of
a
purely
private
agency,
mahsa,
mid-america
health
planning
association,
acting
in
concert
with
the
blue
cross
associations
which
are
also
purely
private.
neither
had
any
governmental
power.
and
i
think
this
appears
most
clearly
on
page
147
of
the
record,
which
is
a
brochure
put
out
by
blue
cross
in
1976
or
7,
about
two
inches
above
the
bottom
of
the
page:
"since
the
state
planning
agency
no
longer
exists.
"
"blue
cross
of
kansas
city
will
look
to
the
local
health
systems
agency
for
approval
of
such
capital
projects.
"
"that
health
systems
agency
in
the
kansas
city
metropolitan
area
is
the
mid-america
health
systems
agency.
"
and
then
the
next
clause
relates
to
the
rest
of
the
state.
"all
projects
not
reviewed
and
approved
by
these
health
systems
agencies
will
not
be
reimbursable
by
blue
cross
of
kansas
city.
"
and
i
repeat
again,
that
mahsa
and
blue
cross
are
purely
private
agencies
which
do
not
exercise
governmental
power.
now,
the
respondents
here
rely
on
a
provision
of
the
statute
which
is
set
out
on
page
2
of
our
blue
brief,
and
at
various
other
places
in
the
brief,
which
provides
that
"a
health
systems
agency
shall
implement
its.
"
--and
this
is
the
statutory
wording...
hsp>
["]...
which
i
put
in
brackets,
means,
health
systems
plan...
aip>
["]...
which
is
annual
implementation
plan...
"and
in
implementing
the
plans
it
shall
perform
at
least
the
following
functions:
(1)
the
agency
shall
seek,
to
the
extent
practicable,
to
implement
its
hsp
and
aip
with
the
assistance
of
individuals
and
public
and
private
entities
in
its
health
service
area.
"
and
the
respondents
say,
look,
that's
all
we
did.
we
just
complied
with
that
provision.
there
was
a
plan
and
we
undertook
to
help
mahsa
implement
it.
the
significance
of
that
section
of
the
statute
on
which
the
respondents'
case
entirely
turns
becomes
clearer
when
the
entire
context
of
the
statute
is
examined.
it's
a
long
statute,
perhaps
less
intricate
than
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
more
diffuse.
and
in
an
effort
to
assist
the
court
in
determining
how
the
various
parts
of
the
statute
mesh,
we've
included
substantial
excerpts
from
it
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow
brief.
actually,
the
statute
itself
is
55
pages
long
in
the
statutes
at
large.
it
would
be
more
that
in
this
print,
and
i
have
included
some
15
pages
of
it
here.
these
are,
of
course,
excerpts.
i
have
tried
to
make
them
a
fair
representation
but
mr.
greenberg
may
have
other
portions
which
he
thinks
are
relevant.
incidentally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
an
error.
we
overdid
things
a
little
bit
on
page,
the
bottom
part
of
page
8a
of
the
appendix,
where
we
repeated
a
part
of
section
300m.
it
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
4a
and
continues
to
8a,
and
then
we
started
over
again
with
300m.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
if
the
court
will
cross
out
the
bottom
two
thirds
of
page
8a
and
the
top
half
of
page
9a
it
will
avoid
a
confusion
for
which
i
apologize.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
8a,
you
strike
out
everything
below
the
black
letter
heading,
300m>
["].
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
certainly
cannot
appropriately,
except
that
briefs
don't
come
within
taxable
costs,
and
so
i'm
afraid
we'll
have
to
pay
for
it.
now,
in
the
statute
congress
set
up
a
planning
structure
in
several
tiers.
at
the
very
top
there
is
a
national
council
on
health
planning
and
development,
and
then
there
are
statewide
health
coordinating
councils.
they
are
to
take
care
of
a
situation
like
missouri
where
there's
one
group
in
st.
louis
and
another
group
in
kansas
city,
so
there's
a
statewide
one
which
coordinates
them.
neither
of
these
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
i
have
not
included
in
the
appendix
the
statutory
provisions
relating
to
them.
but
when
the
statute
is
examined
it
becomes
clear
that
the
key
distinction
is
between
the
next
two
tiers
of
agencies.
these
are
health
system
agencies,
hsa,
on
the
one
hand,
and
state
health
planning
and
development
agencies
on
the
other.
i
have
found
from
my
work
on
this
case
that
it
is
very
easy
to
confuse
them,
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
very
important
not
to
confuse
them,
that
they
are
different
agencies
with
different
functions,
and
mahsa...
mid-america
health
planning
agency...
is
a
health
systems
agency
and
not
a
state
health
planning
and
development
agency.
now,
the
codifiers
in
the
u.s.
code
have
helped
out
a
little
bit
because
the
health
systems
agencies
are
all
in
the
300l
sections.
now
"ell"
becomes
confusing
when
you
put
it
in
print
because
it
looks
like
"one"
so
we've
put
it
in
italics.
but
there
are
several
sections
printed
in
the
appendix
through,
near
the
bottom
of
page
4a,
which
are
300l's,
and
they
all
relate
to
health
systems
agencies.
but
congress
knew
that
state
health
planning
and
development
agencies
were
something
very
different,
and
in
the
codification
they
are
in
the
300m
sections.
and
they
begin
at
the
bottom
of
page
4a
and
continue
to
the
page
15a
in
the
appendix.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
section
300l-1(b)(1)
which
is
on
the
first
page
of
the
appendix,
you
will
see
that
a
health
systems
agency
for
a
health
service
area
must
be
one
of
three
types
of
entities.
it
can
be
(a)
a
nonprofit
private
corporation,
and
that's
what
mahsa
is,
mid-american
health
planning
agency
is
a
nonprofit
private
corporation.
it
can
also
be
a
public
regional
planning
body
or
it
can
be
a
single
unit
of
general
local
government.
but
mahsa
is
not
one
of
those.
under
subsequent
provisions
in
the
300l
sections,
health
systems
agencies
including
mahsa
are
given
what
i
call
grass
roots
responsibility.
their
basic
function
is
to
gather
information
and
make
recommendations.
this
is
shown
by
the
passage
in
the
senate
report
which
is
printed
on
the
bottom
half
of
page
four
of
our
brief.
the
report
says
that
the
responsibilities
of
the
health
systems
agencies
are
the
accumulation
of
data
in
order
to
assess
the
existing
status
of
the
health
care
delivery
system
in
the
area
it
serves,
and
developing
short
and
long
term
recommendations
in
order
to
achieve
the
rational
and
equitable
distribution
of
personal
health
care
services
throughout
its
planning
agency
area.
an
important
part
in
the
legislative
history
is
the
senate
report
which
is
printed
on
page
five
of
our
reply
brief,
where
the
senate
said
that
"the
establishment
of
priorities
within
the
state.
"
--the
senate
committee
said...
"the
establishment
of
priorities
within
the
state
and
the
performance
of
regulatory
functions
are
most
appropriately
carried
out
at
the
state
level.
"
"the
latter
function.
"
--namely,
regulatory
functions...
"can
appropriately
be
carried
only
by
an
agency
of
state
government.
"
and
that
was
repeated
in
another
senate
report
and
a
house
report
at
the
same
time
said,
"the
committee
feels
that
regulatory
activities
are
appropriately
vested
in
units
of
state
government.
"
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
then
they
would
have
determined
by
legislative
action
the
policy
of
the
state
of
missouri.
the
only
question
would
be
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute,
and
subject
to
some
qualifications
about
retroactivity
and
things
of
that
kind,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
found
to
be
constitutional.
but
here
missouri
made
no
enactment;
it
made
no
provision
for
certificate
of
need,
for
restricting
the
construction
of
hospitals.
that
has
been
done
solely
by
these
private
agencies
here,
which
it
is
our
contention
are
not
authorized
by
any
state
or
federal
statute,
and
there
is
no
basis
for
an
implied
immunity
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
it
would
be
very
similar
to
enacting
a
valid
zoning
ordinance.
that's
why
i
said
i
thought
such
a
statute,
except
for
conceivable
things
about
retroactivity,
the
hospital
was
half
built
when
the
statute
was
passed,
or
something
like
that,
bond
issues
had
been
put
out,
that
it
would
be
valid.
now
we
come
to
the
provision
of
the
statute
relating
the
state
health
planning
and
development
agencies,
and
these
are
all
in
the
300m
sections.
and
the
important
thing
to
note
here
is
that
these
are
not
agencies
set
up
by
congress.
they
are
state
agencies
which
the
state
can
provide
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
if
the
state
does
not
provide
such
an
agency
the
state
loses
certain
grants.
section
300m(d)
on
page
8a
of
the
appendix.
the
significant
fact
in
this
case
is
that
missouri
chose
not
to
have
a
state
health
planning
and
development
agency.
under
the
statute
now
passed,
national
gerimedical
is
fully
qualified
statewide,
it
receives
payments
under
medicaid
and
medicare,
it
just
doesn't
receive
payments
under
blue
cross
because
of
the
private
determination
of
blue
cross.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
on
the
contrary,
i
think
missouri
did
have
one
for
a
while
and
repealed
it,
which
would
be
a
choosing
not
to.
now,
let
me
point
out
section
300m(b)(1),
which
is
on
page
5a.
"a
state
health
planning
and
development
agency
must
be
an
agency
of
the
government
of
that
state,
selected
by
the
governor.
"
--the
statute
itself
says
"state
agency"...
"and
it
is
to
administer
the
state
administrative
program.
"
it
has
to
be
an
agency
which
has
the
authority
and
resources
to
administer
the
program,
and
has
a
budget.
then,
in
section
300m(1),
"a
state
administrative
program
is
a
program
for
the
performance
within
the
state
by
its
state
agency.
"
which
is
the
agency
which
did
not
exist
at
this
time.
and,
on
page
10a
of
the
appendix,
the
state
agency
has
to
be
designated
by
the
state
"as
the
sole
agency"
for
the
performance
of
such
functions.
it
has
to
be
one
which
under
state
law
has
authority
to
carry
out
such
functions.
over
on
page
11a,
in
paragraph
6,
are
due
process
provisions.
it
must
hold
public
hearings,
give
notice,
provide
a
record.
on
page
12a,
in
paragraph
(a)
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
there
must
be
provision
for
court
review
of
its
decisions.
now
there
is
no
such
provision
for
mid-america
health
systems
agency.
it
just
made
a
decision
and
that's
it.
there
is
no
way
to
review
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
let
me
say,
mahsa
never
refused
to
issue
a
certificate
of
need.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
assume
it
had?
that
would
be
simply
two
private
groups
agreeing
together
that
they
would--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--it
did
that
thing
which
i
read
from
the
record
in
which
it
said
that
they...
well,
what
mahsa
did
was
to
put
out
an
elaborate
health
planning
thing
which
occupies
hundreds
of--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--blue
cross
read
it
as
meaning--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--no,
it
wouldn't
have
violated
any--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--it
would
not
have
violated
any
federal
or
state
law
whatever.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
recall,
mr.
justice,
at
this
point,
any
provision
of
the
federal
statute
which
that
would
have
violated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
not
in
my
understanding.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
in
my
understanding
of
what--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--the
federal
funds
are
cut
off
from
the
state
only
if
it
doesn't
have
a
state
health
planning
and
development
agency.
in
the
case
of--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--in
the
case
put
by
justice
stevens,
the
state
has
a
state
health
plan,
so
the
state
funds
would
not
be
cut
off.
the
extent
to
which
funds
would
be
cut
off
from
this
hospital
would
turn
on
other
federal
laws.
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
were
not
federal
funds
in
this
hospital,
that
it
was
built
by
the
nonprofit
group
which
conducts
the
hospital.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
distinction
between
health
systems
agencies
and
state
health
planning
and
development
agencies
is
crucial
to
this
case.
health
systems
agencies,
which
is
what
mahsa,
mid-america
health
systems
agency,
was,
have
no
governmental
powers.
the
judgment
below
grants
powers
to
private
bodies,
mahsa
and
the
blue
cross
association,
which
cannot
be
found
either
in
the
federal
or
the
state
law,
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
brief
time
remaining
i
would
like
to
cover
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
greenberg
said
that
antitrust
was
simply
ignored
in
1974.
this
was
before
rex
hospital
and
other
cases
and
everybody
assumed
there
wasn't
any
antitrust
problem.
that,
of
course,
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
statute
which
congress
passed,
because
it
did
include
in
section
3
jul-1(4)
15
lines
dealing
with
exemption
from
liability.
"except
as
provided
in
subparagraph
(b)(1)
a
health
system
agency
shall
not
by
reason
of
the
performance
of
any
duty,
function,
or
activity,
required
of
or
authorized
to
be
undertaken
by
the
agency,
be
liable
for
the
payment
of
damages
under
any
law
of
the
united
states.
"
and
it
goes
on
that
the
exemption
extends
only
to
health
system
agencies.
the
next
paragraph
applies
to...
"no
individual
member
of
the
governing
body
of
the
health
systems
agency
or
employee
shall
be
liable
under
any
law
of
the
united
states.
"
but
there
is
nothing
there
that
is
broad
enough
to
cover
blue
cross.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
"under
any
law
of
the
united
states.
"
and
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--that
was
what
was
involved.
it
does
not
say
specifically
the
antitrust
law.
now,
this
is
covered
specifically
at
the
bottom
of
page
25
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
in
our
reply
brief
we
have
relied
further
on
the
1979
act
where
that
exemption
was
broadened,
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
need
to
broaden
it
if
congress
had
assumed,
well,
we've
already
granted
them
implied
exemption
from
the
antitrust
acts.
now,
reference
was
made
to
the
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
which
indicates
that
there
might
be
some
implied
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
the
plans
include
recommendations
about
centralizing
certain
specialized
services
in
particular
hospitals
for
the
purpose
of
improving
care.
for
example,
there
might
be
two
hospitals
two
blocks
apart
duplicating
services
and
they
might
agree
that
the
obstetrical
work
would
be
done
in
one
hospital
and
the
cardiac
work
be
done
in
another.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
really
a
question
of
implied
immunity.
i
think
that
is
really
a
question
of
rule
of
reason.
it
is
a
question
related
to
what
this
court
has
before
it
now
in
the
maricopa
county
case
coming
from
arizona.
it
may
well
be
that
such
agreements
under
these
circumstances
in
the
health
care
area
do
not
violate
the
antitrust
law,
not
because
they're
exempt
but
because
the
proper
construction
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
that
they
were
not
intended
to
be
covered.
in
this
case
congress
made
it
plain
both
in
the
statute
and
in
the
committee
reports
that
regulatory
functions
could
be
exercised
only
by
state
health
planning
and
development
agencies.
mahsa
had
no
such
powers.
there's
nothing
under
which
blue
cross
association
can
find
umbrage.
their
effort
to
do
so
not
only
finds
no
support
in
the
statute
but
is
a
clear
infringement
on
the
sovereign
choice
made
by
the
state
of
missouri.
