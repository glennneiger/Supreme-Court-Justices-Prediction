justice
stevens
mr.
griswold,
can
i
interrupt
you
to
get
something
out
of
the
way
for
me?
i'm
not
thoroughly...
i
don't
thoroughly
understand,
under
the
statute,
what
the
purpose
of
a
certificate
of
need
is.
on
the
one
hand,
is
it
something
that
is
a
condition
to
getting
a
federal
grant,
or
is
it
something
that
the
federal
government
says
you've
got
to
have
you
can
even
build
a
hospital
with
your
own
money?
what
is
a
certificate
of
need?
why
does
the
statute
talk
about
it?
justice
stevens
--mr.
griswold,
supposing,
though,
that
missouri
had
authorized
the
program
and
then
the
planning
agency,
whatever
its
proper
name
is,
refused
to
designate
the
hospital,
give
it
the
certificate,
and
thereafter
blue
cross
entered
into
the
contract
with
them.
then
would
it
have
violated
federal
law?
in
other
words,
if
you
had
a
state
program
in
place
and
the
state
program
did
not
certify
a
new
hospital,
would
the
federal
statute
be
violated
if
blue
cross
decided
to
insure
the
hospital?
justice
stevens
we're
not
talking
about
federal
funds.
i'm
just
saying--
justice
stevens
--would
it
violate
the
statute
for
blue
cross
to
say,
well,
we'll
go
ahead
and
insure
you
anyway?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
the
one
that
operates
according
to
federal
rules.
justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
griswold,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
statutory
purpose
of
a
certificate
of
need?
does
it
relate
merely
to
eligibility
for
federal
funding
or
is
it
a
condition,
a
federal
prohibition
against
the
building
of
new
hospitals
without
such
a
certificate?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
rephrase
the
question.
supposing
you
had
a
state
agency
and
it
granted
one
hospital
a
certificate
of
need
and
another
one
it
did
not.
and
i
assume
the
first
one
could
get
federal
funding
and
all
sorts
of
things.
the
second
one,
i
assume,
would
not
be
eligible
for
federal
funds
but
would
it
violate
any
federal
law
if
it
nevertheless
went
ahead
and
offered
its
hospital
services
available
to
the
general
public?
justice
stevens
it's
an
awfully
long
statute.
justice
stevens
but
the
one,
i'm
particularly
interested
in
the
one
about
reducing
the
amount
of
hospital
services
or
whatever
it
was.
justice
stevens
and,
in
particular,
where
is
that?
justice
stevens
300l-2(a)(4).
thank
you.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
scope,
mr.
greenberg,
of
the
implied
repeal.
in
other
words,
would
it
cover
a
group,
say,
a
group
of
contractors
who
refuse
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
a
new
hospital
unless
it
first
got
a
certificate
of
need?
justice
stevens
absolutely;
did
not
have
one.
so
what
is
the
scope
of
the
exemption
that
you
contend
existed
in
missouri
in
the
year
in
question
here?
justice
stevens
well,
i
mean,
let's
say,
instead
of
blue
cross,
say
it's
a
group
of
contractors?
justice
stevens
but,
no,
the
thrust
of
my
question
is,
what
is
the
exemption
that
you
contend
congress
created?
i
don't
think
you're
suggesting
congress
had
in
mind
this
particular
hospital
or
this
particular--
justice
stevens
--what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
is
the
scope
of
the
situation
they
had
in
mind
to
grant
an
exemption?
justice
stevens
what
is
it?
just
an
exemption
for
blue
cross?
justice
stevens
would
it
cover
then,
say,
a
group
of
contractors
who
refuse
to
build
a
hospital
or
a
group
of
doctors
who
refuse
to
offer
their
services
unless
they
get...
would
it
cover
all
kinds
of
collusive
activity
or
cooperative
activity
designed
to
prevent
the
construction
of
a
new
hospital?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
greenberg,
there's
a
difference
between
saying
you
don't
want
a
duplication
and
saying,
we
want
a
reduction.
the
statute
doesn't
ever
say
you
need
a
reduction,
does
it?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
says
there
are
too
many
hospital
beds?
justice
stevens
there's
no
statutory
finding
that
i've
been
able
to
find
that
says
there
are
too
many
hospital
beds;
nothing
in
the
statute.
in
fact,
the
statute's
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
whole
concept
because
as
i
understand
it
it's
authorizing
federal
subsidies,
which
presumably
would
enlarge
the
total
supply
of
hospital
services
available
to
being
with.
justice
stevens
or
in
any
specific
place.
justice
stevens
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
but
congress
didn't
say--
justice
stevens
--and
congress
didn't
say
that
nowhere
shall
there
be
any
more
hospitals
unless
they're
approved,
did
it?
justice
stevens
well,
no,
it's
not
a
due
process
claim,
but
i'm
still
puzzled
as
to
what,
even
if
everything
were
in
place,
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
one
of
these
determinations?
is
it
anything
more
than
a
recommendation
for
good
sound
future
planning?
justice
stevens
if
it's
just
a
recommendation,
how
can
it
possibly
give
an
exemption
from
some
legal?
justice
stevens
mr.
greenberg,
am
i
oversimplifying
your
position?
you're
saying
in
effect,
the
statute
says
that
an
agency
like
mahsa
shall
be
created
with
federal
funds
money,
and
unless
that
agency
approves
the
construction
of
new
hospitals
within
the
area
subject
to
its
jurisdiction,
no
new
hospital
shall
be
constructed.
that's
basically
what
the
statute
was
intended
to
say.
justice
stevens
it
surely
could
have
said
it
more
simply.
justice
stevens
they
surely
could
have
said
that
more
simply
than
they
did.
well,
no,
no.
it
directs
the
agency
to
get
input
from
providers
such
as
blue
cross?
justice
stevens
but
once
they
say,
in
effect--
justice
stevens
--they
are
to
be
kind
of
a
licensing
authority,
really,
for
the
area
over
which
they
have
special
planning
interests
and
the
like?
justice
stevens
it
didn't
say
it
in
so
many
words,
but
you
say
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
entire
conglomerate
of--
justice
stevens
--and
not
only
shall
they
seek
to
implement,
but
no
one
shall
build
in
contravention
of
any
of
their
plans.
that's
what
you're
saying
the
statute
means.
justice
stevens
yes,
it
does,
if
you
are
right.
justice
stevens
well,
i
mean...
or
there
is
open
season
on
other
hospitals
can
get
together
and
take
whatever
anticompetitive
measures
are
necessary
to
prevent
any
building
that
is
not
approved
in
advance
by
the
agency.
but
you're
saying
that's--
justice
stevens
--well,
there
would
be
no
antitrust
risk
if
they
merely
made
plans.
that's
why
you
wouldn't
need
an
exemption
if
you
so
read
the
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
all
i'd
suggest
is
you're
confusing
two
different
problems.
one
is
whether
there's
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
which
we
don't
have
to
decide,
and
secondly
whether,
assuming
there
was
a
violation.
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
that
they
could
have
done
exactly
what
they
did
without
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
