but
in
a
sense
it
would
place
the
consumer
in
the
long
run
at
an
advantage,
would
it
not,
in
that
a
lot
of
unneeded
medical
facilities
would
not
be
built?
justice
rehnquist
is
this
a
commitment
not
to
charge
this
as
a
taxable
cost
if
you
prevail?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
griswold,
what
if
the
missouri
legislature
had
taken
up
a
proposal
for
the
formation
of
a
state
regulatory
body
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
95
percent
of
missourians
were
christian
scientists,
and
so
they
simply
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
this
and
they
didn't
want
any
hospital
building
in
the
state;
and
so
they
enacted
a
statute
saying,
there
will
be
no
hospitals
constructed
in
the
state
for
two
years?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
disfavor
of
implied
repeal
is
stronger
in
the
case
of
antitrust
laws
than
in
the
case
of
other
regulatory
laws?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
logan
act,
passed
in
1796?
justice
rehnquist
general
mccree,
was
there
any
finding
in
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
that
the
actions
of
the
blue
cross
in
effect
violated
the
antitrust
acts
here,
or
was
it
just
the
whole
thing
turned
on
whether
they
were
exempt
from
the
antitrust
acts?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
greenberg,
under
what
authority
did
congress
take
that
action?
justice
rehnquist
it
simply
provided
that
if
the
states
didn't
comply
they
would
not
get
the
funding?
justice
rehnquist
where
are
those
words?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
it
entirely
accurate
to
say
it's
created
by
federal
authority?
it's
authorized.
justice
rehnquist
i
have
not
understood
your
argument
as
a
parker
v.
brown
immunity.
justice
rehnquist
but
as
an
implied
exception
or
pro
tanto
repealer,
which
i
in
my
limited
knowledge
of
antitrust
law
have
thought
of
as
two
two
different
things.
one
is
that
if
the
state
authorizes
raisin
proration
it's
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
not
by
virtue
of
anything
congress
has
done
but
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
is
behind
it;
and
other
federal
statutes,
such
as
nasd
and
the
gordon
v.
new
york
stock
exchange,
where
the
congress
has
authorized
regulation
of
a
particular
industry
that's
inconsistent
with
the
antitrust
laws,
there
will
be
implied
a
pro
tanto
repealer.
and
those
are
two
different
doctrines,
are
they
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
your
suggestion
that
after
blue
cross
had
sat
on
the
board
of
mahsa
and
the
mahsa
as
a
unit
had
said,
the
number
one
priority
is
oversupply
of
beds,
it
would
have
been
in
effect
reneging
on
its
role
in
mahsa
if
it
had
gone
ahead
and
paid
the
plaintiff
in
this
case?
