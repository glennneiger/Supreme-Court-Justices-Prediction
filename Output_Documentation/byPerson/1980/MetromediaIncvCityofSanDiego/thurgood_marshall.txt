mr.
abrams,
along
with
my
brother
stevens
i
have
trouble
with
the
word
"many".
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean,
without
precedent,
our
opinion
would
have
to
say
that
the
precedent
is
that
in
the
case
where
"many
businesses"
et
cetera
et
cetera,
that
this
would
be
invalid.
justice
marshall
but
it
doesn't
say
that
they're...
this
does
not
say
that
they
are
insufficient,
it
says
many
people
think
it
is
insufficient.
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
marshall
well,
it
doesn't
say
it's
true
or
not.
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
say
it's
a
fact
or
not,
it
just
says,
many
people
think
it's
a
fact.
justice
marshall
one
more
question
and
then
i'm
true.
is
there
any
testimony
other
than
that
stipulation?
justice
marshall
that's
right.
so
that's
the
only
thing
we've
got,
to
say
that
there
are
not
other
means?
justice
marshall
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
marshall
--you're
talking
to
the
man
who
drew
the
ordinance.
take
care.
justice
marshall
is
that
sufficient?
justice
marshall
is
the
fact
that
it's
commercial
sufficient
for
you
to
win?
justice
marshall
is
it
sufficient,
was
my
question.
justice
marshall
but
it
says,
no
time,
no
place,
in
no
manner,
doesn't
it?
justice
marshall
--could
los
angeles
ban
all
billboards?
justice
marshall
could
they,
under
your
argument?
justice
marshall
any
city
could?
justice
marshall
well,
why
don't
you
ban
women
walking
down
the
street?
