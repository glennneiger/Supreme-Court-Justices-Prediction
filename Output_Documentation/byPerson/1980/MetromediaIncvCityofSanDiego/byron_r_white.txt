mr.
abrams,
suppose
the
ordinance
permitted
signs
carrying
noncommercial
advertising,
but
forbade
commercial
advertising
in
this
commercial
zone?
and
by
the
way,
on
its
face
this
ordinance
just
applies
to
the
commercial
zone,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
but
other
ordinances
keep
it
out
of
the
city
entirely?
justice
white
now,
how
about
my
first
question?
justice
white
no,
i
mean,
billboard
advertising,
commercial
billboard--
justice
white
--the
same
argument
as
you've
been
making,
with
respect
to
that?
justice
white
but
that
isn't
the
compelling
interest
test,
is
it?
justice
white
so
your
facial
attack
on
this
ordinance
is
really
an
overbreadth
attack?
justice
white
to
the
extent
that
you're
invoking
the
compelling
state
interest,
you're
really
arguing
that
the
ordinance
is
invalid
because
it
bans
noncommercial
billboard?
justice
white
well,
and
because
it's...
but
if
it
only
banned
commercial
speech,
you
wouldn't
invoke
the
compelling
state
interest?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
only
reason
then
that
you're
urging
on
us
the
compelling
state
interest
test
is
because
it
is
a
flat
ban
and
includes
noncommercial
billboarding
things.
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
well,
why...
well,
in
that
event,
why
wouldn't
we
have
to
divide
the
case
up
into
whether
the
ordinance
is
valid
with
respect
to
commercial
speech
and
valid
in...
and
the
test
would
be
the
noncommercial
speech?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
can't
stipulate
us
in--
justice
white
so,
what
about
signs...
there's
an
exception
here,
among
one
of
these,
about
signs
for
news?
justice
white
you
mean
it
isn't
a
moving--
justice
white
--it
isn't
a
moving
sign
that
has
spot
news
on
it?
justice
white
well,
what
kind
of
news
goes
on
those
signs?
justice
white
oh.
but
it
can
change
every
five
minutes?
