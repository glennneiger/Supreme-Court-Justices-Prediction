chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
metromedia,
incorporated
v.
city
of
san
diego.
mr.
abrams,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
would
it
make
any
difference,
mr.
abrams,
if
this
were
a
town
of
10,000?
chief
justice
burger
would
that
mean
that
in
an
area
that
was
mixed,
that
is,
residences
and
stores
and
theaters
and
the
usual
mix,
you'd
have
a
different
rule?
chief
justice
burger
how
can
you
justify
a
ban
on
billboards
across
the
street
from
the
supreme
court,
as
you
suggested?
chief
justice
burger
but
they've
banned
some
kinds
of
advertising?
chief
justice
burger
well,
in
some
countries
they
do
it
without
advertising.
chief
justice
burger
i
think
we
have
that
point
clear,
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sumption.
chief
justice
burger
before
this
argument,
mr.
sumption,
was
there
any
limitation
on
kinetic
signs,
the
kind
that
have
something
moving
to
attract
the
eye?
chief
justice
burger
one
writer
has
suggested
that
the
compelling
state
interest
as
a
test
is
a
test
that
a
state
can't
pass.
chief
justice
burger
i
was
just
picking
up
what
justice
stewart
and
justice
rehnquist
had
mentioned
about
this
semantical
problem
that
you
mentioned.
chief
justice
burger
the
test
is
one
that
simply
can't
be
met.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we
would
add
to
that
your
yielding
some
of
the
court's
time
back
to
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
