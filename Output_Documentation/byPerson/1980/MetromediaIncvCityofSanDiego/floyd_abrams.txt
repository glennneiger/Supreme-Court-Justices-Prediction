mr.
floyd
abrams
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
upholding
against
constitutional
challenge
a
san
diego
ordinance
the
purpose
and
effect
of
which
is
to
prohibit
all
off-premise
outdoor
advertising
within
the
city
of
san
diego.
there
has
been
some
dispute
between
the
parties
in
the
briefs
as
to
the
precise
scope
of
the
statute
and
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
with
that.
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
san
diego,
now
the
eighth
largest
city
in
the
nation
and
the
second
in
california,
is
a
sprawling
320-mile
city
filled
with
hundreds
of
miles
of
streets,
with
a
significant
industrial
and
commercial
area,
and
as
well,
of
course,
with
park
areas,
beach
areas,
residential
and
other
areas.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
make
a
difference
only
in
this
sense,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
think
that
it
is
relevant
that
this
is
a
case
which
arises
entirely
out
of
a
ban
which
takes
place
in
an
industrial
and
commercial
area,
in
part
because
we
are
met
with
the
argument
by
our
opponents
that
outdoor
advertising
is
in
its
entirety
commercial
speech,
which
it
is
not.
but
even
if
it
were
commercial
speech,
or
even
if
it
is,
as
it
is,
more
commercial
speech
than
other
kinds
of
speech,
then
it's
surely
relevant
that
we
deal
here
only
with
an
industrial
and
commercial
area.
in
a
smaller
community
which
had
an
industrial
and
commercial
area,
we
would
be
urging
on
you
virtually
the
same
arguments
as
today.
it
is
conceivable
that
in
some
other
area,
on
some
different
facts,
absent
the
stipulated
record
here
today,
that
a
balance
could
conceivably
be
struck
in
a
different
fashion
than
we
are
urging
on
you
today.
it
is
conceivable
that
that
could
be
the
case
in
an
area
of
10,000
people
rather
than
a
large
industrial
city.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
do
concede,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it
could
be
banned
in
certain
residential
areas,
particularly,
for
example,
a
residential
area
as
part
of
a
larger
community
where
it
is
allowed
elsewhere;
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
and--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--all
i'm
saying
is
that
we
think
it
does
depend,
as
a
number
of
the
cases
of
this
court
in
other
areas
have
indicated,
upon
the
relationship
between
one
area
and
another.
if
there's
a
residential
area
of
a
city,
for
example,
we
certainly
do
concede
that
that
is
doable.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
and
that
does
not
raise
in
the
same
acute
fashion
the
issue--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
think
the
rule
of
law
that
we
would
urge
on
you
today
would
be
the
same.
the
only
thing
that
would
be
different
is
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
balance
to
be
struck
at
all,
i
must
acknowledge
to
you
that
it
is
at
least
conceivable
on
a
different
factual
record
that
the
balance
could
be
struck
in
a
different
way
than
we
would
urge
on
you
today.
if
you
do
anything
less
than
establish
a
per
se
rule
that
under
no
circumstances
may
outdoor
advertising
be
banned...
and
we
have
not
gone
that
far
in
our
advocacy
view...
implicit
in
that
is
that
there
could
be
some
circumstance,
and
that
there
would
be
some
circumstance,
in
which
it
could
be
proper
to
ban
outdoor
advertising.
now,
there
are
factors
we
think
that
you
should
consider.
there
are
things
to
be
weighed
in
making
that
decision,
but
one
of
them,
we
think,
is
that
this
arises
in
a
commercial
and
industrial
area
of
a
large
urban
community.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
based
on
the
stipulated
facts
we
deal
here
with
a
case
where
san
diego
has
2.8
percent
of
the
city
which
is
zoned
commercial
and
industrial.
all
outdoor
advertising
as
the
parties
have
defined
it,
as
legislation
generally
defines
it,
is
in
that
area.
and
by
outdoor
advertising
we
mean
outdoor
advertising
as
distinguished
from
so-called
on-site
advertising.
on-site
advertising
is
basically
advertising
about
the
building,
the
place
itself
in
which
an
event,
a
business,
occurs.
the
service
is
sold
there,
the
products
made
there.
outdoor
advertising,
as
the
parties
have
stipulated,
is
a
different
thing.
it
is,
as
the
parties
have
said,
a
medium
of
communication.
it
is
in
fact
a
medium
which
is
distinct
and
unique
in
a
variety
of
ways.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
not
exist,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
there
were
no
roads.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
correct.
one
wouldn't
choose
to
build
it
there,
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
no
less
a
medium
of
communication
because
it's
based
on
roads
than
sound
trucks
are,
which
need
roads
to
travel
on.
media
of
communication
are
not
the
same,
but
the
fact
that
one
requires
a
road
to
be
on
or
to
travel
on
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
make
it
any
less
a
medium
of
communication.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
correct.
mr.
floyd
abrams
a
sound
truck
wouldn't
be
there.
a
leaflet
distributor
wouldn't
have
streets
to
walk
on,
if
he
were
distributing
leaflets,
unless
the
streets
were
there.
i
think
it
fair
to
say
that
these
things
are,
in
this
respect
at
least,
essentially
the
same.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
for
billboards
to
exist
one
needs
the
things,
the
road
near
it
to
exist.
and
we
don't
think
that
makes
it
any
less
a
medium
of
communication.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
would
urge
on
you,
as
strenuously
as
we
can,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
no
less
than
a
compelling
state
interest
test
ought
to
be
applied.
now,
we
believe,
for
reasons...
i
would
like
to
turn--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
the
medium
itself
can't
be
destroyed
unless
you
meet
something
in
the
order
of
a
compelling
state
interest
test
and
a
statute
drafted
as
the
compelling
state
interest
test
requires,
of
the
narrowest
possible
nature
to
serve
the
interest.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
in
the
main
be
the
same,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
only
difference
that
i
can
conceive
of
is
this.
to
the
extent
that
a
time,
place,
and
manner
test
were
applied...
as
we
would
urge
on
you
that
it
is
not
the
correct
test,
but
if
that
were
applied...
alternative
channels
of
communication
is
one
of
the
aspects
of
that
test.
again,
it
is
conceivable,
although
i
think
highly
unlikely
and
it's
really
not
the
case
in
san
diego,
that
a
community
which
has
never
ever
had
any
kind
of
outdoor
advertising
could
in
theory
have
built
up
such
alternatives
of
such
a
discreet
and
unique
nature
to
compensate
for
the
absence
of
it
that
maybe
in
some
city
or
community
they
have
found
their
way
around
it.
i
don't
think
that's
likely
and
it
is
our
argument
to
you
that
the
issue
is
basically
the
same,
for
example,
in
san
diego,
whether
no
billboards
had
been
built
or
whether
there
are
a
number
of
billboards
available
now.
now,
the
reason
that
we
feel
freer
to
say
that
in
san
diego
is
that
we
do
have
a
stipulation
of
the
parties
which
says,
in
as
close
to
so
many
words
as
parties
can,
that
there
are
no
alternative
means
which
do
suffice.
so
i
am
comfortable
at
least
in
the
san
diego
context
of
saying
to
you
that
whether
or
not
there
were
a
lot
of
billboards
there
or
not,
the
result
should
be
the
same.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
stipulation
28
entered
into
by
the
parties--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it's
at
page
125a
and
126a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
says:
"valuable
commercial,
political,
and
social
information
is
communicated
to
the
public
through
the
use
of
outdoor
advertising.
"
"many
businesses
and
politicians
and
other
persons
rely
upon
outdoor
advertising
because
other
forms
of
advertising
are
insufficient,
inappropriate,
and
prohibitively
expensive.
"
we
think
that
goes
about
as
far
as
parties
could,
or
indeed,
a
court
could,
to
establish
the
fact
that
alternative
channels
of
communication
are
insufficient
to
serve
the
many
people
who
find
outdoor
advertising
indispensable
in
san
diego.
and
the
language
of
the
stipulation,
we
think,
is
clear
enough
on
its
face.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
i
think
the
parties,
mr.
justice
stevens,
really
would
have
said
"some"
if
they
had
meant
"some".
"many"--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
dictionary
definition
of
"many"
is
"large"--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--oh,
no,
no,
not
over
20.
it
does
seem
to
us
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that's
true.
but
what
the
stipulation
indicates
to
you
and
what
a
brief,
for
example,
submitted
to
you
amicus
curiae
by
users
of
outdoor
advertising
in
support
of
the
stipulation
indicate
to
you
is
that
this
is
not
a
little
thing,
that
this
is
in
fact
many
businesses,
and
they
find
it
the
best
way
to
communicate.
and
it's
not
just
business-oriented,
and
that
they
do
it
because
other
means
are
insufficient,
inappropriate,
and
prohibitively
expensive.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
the
dictionary
definition,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
"large".
i
can't
do
better
than
to
tell
you
it's--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no.
if
you
were
to
apply
a
time,
place,
and
manner
test,
what
your
opinion,
what
the
precedent,
as
i
view
it,
would
be
is
that
where
alternate
channels
of
communication
are
as
a
matter
of
fact...
in
this
case
we
think
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
fact...
and
where
they
are,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
insufficient--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well,
it
says,
many
people
of
a
variety
of
sorts
rely
upon
it
because
other
means
are
insufficient,
inappropriate,
and
prohibitively
expensive.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i'm
sorry?
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
if
i
can
go
back
to
the
linmark
case,
for
example,
which
your
honor
wrote
a
few
years
ago,
in
the
context
of
dealing
with
signs
on
lawns,
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
by
no
means
clear
that
other
means
of
communication
would
serve,
even
though
that
was
a
situation
in
which
ads
could
be
put
in
the
newspaper
and
that
there
were
other
ways
to
communicate.
we
don't
deny...
how
could
we?
that
there
are
other
ways
to
communicate.
what
we
do
urge
on
you
is
that
in
the
context
where
you
have
a
distinct,
unique
kind
of
communication,
that
at
least
the
law
ought
to
provide
a
first
amendment
test...
and
we
think
we
can
meet
any
first
amendment
test,
but
a
first
amendment
test...
and
not
simply
a
property-oriented
test
before
allowing
its
complete
destruction.
and
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--there
was
no
testimony,
your
honor,
because
this
case
came
up--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
is
the
record
on
this
subject.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
are
briefs
which
lend
support
to
that
record,
but
the
record
as
such,
on
that
point,
is
the
stipulation.
now--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
that
was
a
typographical
error
that
should
be
corrected.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes...
i
must
tell
you,
though,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
the
typographical
error
was
in
the
stipulation
and
we
corrected
it,
as
it
were.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
sir,
and
i
don't
think
anyone's
to
blame
for
it.
it
just
happened
in
the
typing
of
the
stipulation.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
hope
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
believe
that
dirigibles
carrying
signs
are
a
distinct
medium
of
communication.
they're
certainly
not
a
recognized
medium
of
communication
in
the
same
sense
as
congress,
say,
itself
in
various
legislation
referring
to
outdoor
advertising,
meaning
and
saying
that
they
mean
commercial
billboards
as
outdoor
advertising.
it's
not
the
same
thing
in
terms
of
the
commonplace
use
through
centuries
of
outdoor
advertising.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
i
think
that,
you
know,
one
is
entitled...
i
would
like
to
put
it
this
way,
that
the
response
that
i
would
give
to
the
question
of,
how
can
you
tell
if
something
is
a
medium
of
communication,
because
i
think
that's
what
we're
really
addressing
now,
is
well
put
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
martin
v.
struthers
case
when
he
dealt
with
door-to-door
solicitation.
and
he
looked
at
the
history
of
door-to-door
solicitation,
he
looked
at
the
commonplace
nature
of
door-to-door
solicitation,
he
looked
at
the
fact
that
it
was
available
and
important
to
diverse
groups
of
citizens.
those
things
are
true,
we
think,
on
the
stipulated
record
of
this
case,
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
with
respect
to
outdoor
advertising.
i
don't
think
it's
true
with
respect
to
dirigibles
flying
over
a
community.
beyond
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that,
too...
i
mean,
the
fact
that
these
things
happen,
and
they
do,
they
are
really
not--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--but
if
airplanes
went
about
dropping
leaflets,
say,
i
don't
think
one
would
call
that
a
medium
of
communication,
even
though
leaflets
are.
there
are
some
things
which
become
well
established
enough,
we
think,
for
this
court
to
give
it
a
treatment
as
if
it
is
something
not
the
same
as
other
things.
we
think
outdoor
advertising,
by
the
stipulation
of
the
parties,
by
the
recognition
by
congress,
by
its
historical
use,
has
achieved
that
status.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
responded
earlier
to
justice
stewart
by
saying
that
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
constitutionality,
per
se,
at
least,
of
zoning
regulations
which
ban
outdoor
advertising
in
residential
areas.
that
does
not
mean,
or
i
don't
want
to
convey
to
you
the
proposition
that
there
is
never
an
area
which
is
residential
or
of
sufficient
size
or
of
a
sufficient
nature
where
outdoor
advertising
is
not
in
fact
a
medium
of
communication
of
which
the
public
can't
be
deprived.
i
could
imagine,
for
example,
a
different
ruling
from
this
court
as
to
sound
trucks
going
through
one
kind
of
community
and
another.
it
cannot
be
that
sound
trucks
can
be
banned
in
their
entirety
from
the
width
and
breadth
of
san
diego.
it
is
conceivable
that
in
a
community
small
enough
and
sleepy
enough
and
quiet
enough
that
the
court
might
strike
a
different
balance
with
respect
to
sound
trucks
in
that
area.
and
i
think
the
same
is
true,
i
urge
upon
you,
it
would
be
true
with
respect
to
leaflets.
it
does
make
a
difference
where
first
amendment
rights
are
claimed.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
makes
a
difference
therefore,
whether
it
is
claimed
in
a
residential
or
an
urban
area.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
would
depend,
mr.
justice
powell,
it
seems
to
me,
on
where
it
is.
washington,
for
example,
now
does
allow
outdoor
advertising
in
its
commercial-manufacturing
zone.
you
will
see
some
billboards
out
on
new
york
avenue,
for
example.
there
are
some
billboards
in
certain
other
areas
of
town.
if
the
statute
related
to
the
area
around
this
courthouse,
say,
which
is
essentially
federal
land
and
which
would,
as
i
understand
it,
require
a
new
federal
law,
in
fact,
to
allow
it,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
floyd
abrams
pennsylvania
avenue,
alone?
no,
i
would
not
say
that
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes.
i
would
not
say
that
downtown
washington
alone
is
of
a
sort
where
it
would
be
per
se
unconstitutional
to
have
a
ban
on
billboards.
because
it
does
depend
on
the
separate
facts
of
the
situation.
now,
i
must
qualify
my
answers
at
least
to
this
degree.
to
the
extent
that
factual
issues
are
raised
in
a
variety
of
questions
asked
here
today,
obviously,
you
would
need
a
new
factual
record
as
to
the
nature
of
the
community,
the
kind
of
people
that
live
and
work
in
the
community,
the
size
of
the
community,
a
variety
of
factors
which
we
think
at
least
ought
to
bear
upon
a
decision.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
believe
that
compelling
state
interest--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i
must
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
was
premising
my
answer
on
the
possibility
that
an
even
lesser
standard
could
be
applied.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
do
a
time,
place,
and
manner
analysis
for
you.
now,
we
have
urged
upon
you
in
our
brief
that
a
time,
place,
and
manner
analysis
is
insufficiently
protective
in
a
situation
in
which
an
entire
medium
is
being
banned.
and
i
would
like
to
start
briefly
with
that
because
we
do
think
it's
important
even
though
we
think
we
can
meet
a
time,
place,
and
manner
analysis.
to
say
this:
if
there
were
a
ban
in
let's
say
a
large
community
or
a
small
community
of
all
magazines
or
of
all
something
else,
the
problem
with
a
time,
place,
and
manner
analysis
is
that
if
the
ban
gets
large
enough,
sweeping
enough,
not
subject
as
we
argue
with
respect
to
this
statute
of
certain
underinclusiveness,
that
it
might
be
able
to
meet
a
time,
place,
and
manner
test.
if
some
community
were
to
object
to
magazines
on
the
basis
of
littering
the
streets
and
big
trucks
going
down
the
streets
delivering
magazines,
it
could
be
said
that
that
is
a
significant
governmental
interest.
it
could
be
said
that
it
is
content-neutral,
because
they're
banning
all
magazines.
and
it
could
be
said,
given
the
theory
of
the
california
supreme
court
at
least,
contrary
to
our
views,
that
there
are
adequate
channels
of
alternative
communication.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
our
view
is
that
it
is
not.
it
cannot
be
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation
if
it
is
a
total
prohibition,
for
the
reasons
that
i
stated.
a
total
prohibition
is,
at
its
essence,
something
which
is
not
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
mr.
floyd
abrams
now,
it
happens
in
this
case
that
we
believe,
for
reasons
i've
indicated
earlier,
that
even
if
we
had
to
show
you
the
absence
of
alternative
channels
of
communication,
that
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
goes
a
long
way,
and
that
for
reasons
stated
in
our
brief
the
statute
is
underinclusive
in
other
ways,
and
so
we
think
it
can't
be
shown
by
them,
as
they
must
show,
even
in
the
time,
place,
and
manner
test,
it
can't
be
shown
by
the
city
of
san
diego
that
it
is
in
fact
content
neutral,
because
of
what
it
leaves
untouched.
mr.
floyd
abrams
absolutely
not.
i
was
simply
trying
to
be
informational
about
what
i
understand
to
be
the
law
here.
my
answer
was
not
at
all
premised
on
the
fact
that
it
is
federal
land.
i
agree
with
everything
your
question
said.
my
answer
was
premised
on
my
own
observation
absent,
i
must
say,
a
factual
record,
but
my
own
sense
of
the
city
of
washington.
there
is
an
area
in
washington
which
i
know
as
a
commercial-industrial
area.
there
are
outdoor
advertising
displays
in
that
area.
there
is
an
area
of
washington
which
is
of
a
special,
scenic,
governmental,
other-nature.
it
has
never
been
our
contention
in
this
case
that
it
is
a
flat
ban
or
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
keep
outdoor
advertising
out
of
certain
parts
of
cities
and
that
that
was
the
basis
of
my
answer.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
can
justify
that
as
a
time,
place,
and
manner
limitation.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
are
told
that
there
there
is
a
part
of
a
city
in
which
billboards
are
not
to
be
allowed
but
that
they
are
to
be
allowed
elsewhere,
that
is
a
classic
time,
place,
and
manner
limitation,
precisely
the
same
as
if
you
said,
no
sound
trucks
outside
the
supreme
court,
or
certain
other
limitations
so
long
as
there
are
other
places
where
it
can
be
done.
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
there
could
be
a
total
ban,
but
i
would
have
to
concede
that
the
balance
would
be
a
different
kind
of
balance.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
would
give
the
same
answer,
that
a
different
balance
would
have
to
be
struck
based
on
the
nature
of
the
community
and
the
activities
which
occur.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
in
each
of
these
cases
there
would
necessarily
be
a
different
factual
record.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
i'm
not
saying,
if
you
have
factories.
what
i
am
saying
is
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
easiest
case
for
determination
is
one
in
which
there
is
a
manufacturing
area,
and
that
that,
in
and
of
itself,
ought
to
at
least
presumptively
lead
you
to
say
that
you
can't
have
a
total
ban.
the
hardest--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes;
absolutely.
now,
the
hardest
case
for
me
to
argue
to
you,
that
a
ban,
a
total
ban
is
unconstitutional,
is
in
the
smallest,
most
williamsburg-like
area.
now,
again,
i'm
not
saying
that
because
there's
an
industrial
area
that's
the
only
area
in
which
you
have
to
allow
some
billboards,
and
that
that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
like
so
many
first
amendment
cases,
the
facts
and
the
factors
differ.
where
things
occur,
what
traditionally
occurs
in
an
area,
whether
or
not
there
are
factories,
bears
upon
the
decision
in
the
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
one
of
the--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
reason
in
part,
about
williamsburg.
and
it
is,
really,
where
williamsburg
is
and
its
relationship
to
other
communities.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
on
my
submission,
what
i
am
conceding
arguendo
is
that
a
sufficient
showing
of
esthetic
claim
could
conceivably
be
made
and
proved
by
the
state,
which
has
the
burden
of
proving
it.
mr.
floyd
abrams
of
proving
even
by
compelling
state
interest
test.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
is
something
more
than
a
significant
state
interest.
it
is
of
overriding
importance.
now,
we
think
that
there
is
some
real
doubt
as
to,
and,
indeed,
we
urge
upon
you
that
the
simple
assertion
of
esthetics
should
in
no
circumstance
be
deemed
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
is
conceivable
in
the
williamsburg
situation--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--notwithstanding
that
radio
and
television
is
a
regulated
industry
and
that
congress
has
a
significant
amount
of
power
with
respect
to
it,
i
believe
it
would
raise
very
grave
constitutional
problems.
mr.
floyd
abrams
they
have
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
to
have
a
total
ban
would
in
effect
preclude
radio
and
television
from
covering
the
news,
because
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
it,
from
doing
other
things
which
on
anyone's
theory
in
this
room
would
be
first
amendment-protected.
and
that
is
also
one--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--in
some
countries
they
do
it
without
advertising.
it
would
be
my
view,
perhaps
for
another
day,
that
given
the
nature
of
broadcast
regulation
as
we
have
in
this
country,
to
switch
it
so
as
totally
to
deprive
broadcasters
of
the
opportunity
to
stay
in
business
and
hence
to
do
all
the
first
amendment-protected
things
that
then
they
do
would
at
least
raise
very
serious
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
think
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
if
the
statute
contained
a
flat
ban
on
all
of
commercial
speech.
for
one
thing,
it
would
discriminate--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
i
would
think
that
the
same
argument
i
would
be
making,
i
would
perhaps
emphasize
a
little
more,
that
even
if
you
were
to
apply
the
commercial
speech
cases
of
this
court,
and
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
protect
here
than
that
which
this
court
has
said
must
be
protected
in
the
area
of
commercial
speech,
that
this
statute
cannot
meet
a
test
which
says
that
it's
no
more
extensive
than
necessary.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
i'm
saying
that
even
if
you
apply
a
much
lower
level
test,
even
if
you
apply
a
pure
commercial
speech
test,
that
a
statute
which
is
a
flat
ban
on
all
commercial
billboard
speech
within
a
commercial
area--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
that
is
one
of
the
devices
of
this
statute.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
sir,
i'm
saying
that
it
is,
that
the
reason
we
urge
upon
you
a
compelling
state
interest
test
or
a
test
of
that
order
of
magnitude
is
because
of
the
flatness
of
the
ban
here.
mr.
floyd
abrams
if
it
only
banned
commercial
speech
i
would
urge
upon
you
a
test
which
is
of
less
protection--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--but,
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
is
correct
that
the
advocacy
of
the
compelling
state
interest
test
arises
out
of
the
totality
of
the
ban
which
includes
ideological
and
commercial
speech.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
let
me
say,
first
of
all
because
we
have
agreement
of
the
parties
here
that
if
commercial
speech
is
not
allowed
there
can
be
no
so-called
ideological
speech
on
outdoor
advertising.
we
urged
that
in
our
brief;
mr.
sumption
agreed
to
it
in
his
brief.
he's--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--i'm
not
saying
that
you
are
bound
by
that,
i'm
saying
that
it
is
certainly
relevant
in
your
consideration
of
the
effects
of
a
total
ban.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
even
if
you
were
to
give
us
the
most
minimal
test
afforded
by
this
court
under
the
commercial
speech
doctrine,
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
final
prong
of
that
doctrine
can
be
met
on
the
basis
of
a
flat
ban.
that
prong
is
that
the
regulation
can
be
no
more
extensive
than
is
necessary
to
serve
the
state
interest
which
is
asserted.
and
flat
bans
such
as
this--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--given
the
assertion
by
them
of
the
state
interest
that
they
assert
and
the
total
failure
on
this
record
of
san
diego
to
meet
any
burden
whatsoever,
other
than
saying
we
haven't
met
a
burden,
would
in
and
of
itself
resolve
this
case
in
our
favor.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
it
would
be
content-related
and
it
would
have
the
vice
of
all
content-related
statutes.
we
have
urged
indeed
that
the
very
statute
before
you
is,
because
of
various
factors
relating
to
it,
content
related.
but
i
should
have
added
that
in
response
to
justice
white.
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
powell,
having
been
to
williamsburg,
i
can
assert
to
the
court
that
on
the
outskirts
of
williamsburg
one
sees
more
than
a
share
of
billboards.
mr.
floyd
abrams
not
in
the
historic
section,
and
that
again
we
believe--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--maybe
i
should
stop.
but
williamsburg
really
is
a
good
example,
if
i
can
sum
up
on
that,
that
it's
perfectly
proper
to
say
in
the
historic
section
of
williamsburg,
you're
not
going
to
have
billboards.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
it's
proper
is
that
in
fact
you
do
have
exposure
to
outdoor
advertising
outside
that
central
district.
and
that's
all
that
we've
come
here
to
talk
about
today,
that
that
is
precisely
what
san
diego
does
not
allow
to
any
degree,
not
even
in
its
business
and
commercial
area.
mr.
floyd
abrams
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
applies
to
that.
except
in
the
circumstance
where
the
totality
of
the
effect
of
that
in
an
area
large
enough
to
be
of
constitutional--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--that
too
we
think
is
again
a
classic
time,
place
and
manner
test.
that's
not
unconstitutional.
the
california
statute,
which--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--because
there
are
limits
on
the
distance
from
the
highway?
not
at
all,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
would
urge
on
you,
as
an
example
of
how
a
statute
can
be
drafted
to
meet
constitutional
demands,
the
california
statute
which
is
referred
to
at
page
2
of
our
reply
brief.
california
has
passed
a
statute,
over
40
other
states
have
passed
statutes,
which
do
have
limitations
on
where
billboards
can
be,
which
do
have
limitations
on
the
relationship
between
a
billboard
and
an
intersection,
for
example.
that's
not
unconstitutional.
what's
unconstitutional
is
a
flat
ban
of
the
sort,
of
the
nature,
of
the
totality
that
san
diego
has
done.
mr.
floyd
abrams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
