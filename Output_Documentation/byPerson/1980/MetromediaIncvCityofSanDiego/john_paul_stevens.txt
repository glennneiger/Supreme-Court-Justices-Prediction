justice
stevens
is
it
also
true
that
the
first
amendment
issue
would
be
the
same
if
there
had
been
no
history
of
outdoor
advertising
in
san
diego
but
that
you
wanted
to
enter
the
market
for
the
first
time?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
part
of
the
stipulation.
there
are
no
alternative
means
that
suffice
to
do
what?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
that's
really
just
another
way
of
saying
there's
a
market
for
outdoor
advertising?
some
people
prefer
it
as
the
most
efficient
way
of
communicating
their
message.
justice
stevens
well,
"many".
justice
stevens
over
20?
justice
stevens
however,
the
number
of
people
who
use
outdoor
advertising
probably
is
related
to
the
number
of
signs
you
have
up,
because
they're
all
being
sold
and
used.
so
that's
what...
you
have
many
signs.
so
many
people
are
using
them.
they've
obviously
found
it
the
most
efficient
way
to
advertise.
justice
stevens
it
could
be
with
respect
to
small
airplanes
carrying
signs
in
miami,
though.
maybe
that
isn't
the
same
sort
of
thing.
justice
stevens
and
they're
a
regular,
customary
method
of
advertising,
frequently
used,
and
some
people
regard
them
as
rather
an
unpleasant
sight.
justice
stevens
but
you've
acknowledged
that
a
residential
community
which
may
be
growing
could
start
out
with
no
billboard
advertising.
and
what
you're
saying,
i
suppose,
is
that
at
a
point
in
its
growth
there
would
come
into
being
a
constitutional
right
to
put
billboards
up,
if
it
grew
gradually
from
a
small
residential
community
to
a
large
city?
at
some
point
in
its
historical
development
a
constitutional
right
would
emerge.
justice
stevens
well,
if
washington
had
been
limited
to
the
governmental
buildings
and
the
park
and
historic
areas
and
residential
areas
and
there
had
been
no
manufacturing
area,
could
there
be
a
total
ban
in
the
city
of
washington?
justice
stevens
how
about
the
city
of
williamsburg,
virginia,
historic
restoration?
could
they
totally
ban
it?
justice
stevens
what
you're
really
saying,
i
think,
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
billboards
if
you
have
factories.
justice
stevens
well,
what
other
than
factories,
what
kind
of
community
that
does
not
have
any
manufacturing
district
in
it
could
not
ban
billboards?
it
seems
to
me
you've
conceded
that
they
could
be
banned
in
historic
areas,
conceded
they
could
be
banned
in
residential
areas.
but
if
the
city
adds
a
manufacturing
area,
then
is
it
the
constitutional
duty
to
allow
billboards?
justice
stevens
--mr.
abrams,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
response
to
justice
white
of
a
hypothetical
of
a
partial
ban
would
be
even
more
objectionable
than
the
total
ban
because
(a)
it
wouldn't
take
down
the
billboards
and
(b)
it
would
be
content-related.
justice
stevens
mr.
abrams,
your
point
about
the
outside
area
reminds
me
that
i
meant
to
ask
you,
does
your
argument
also
apply
to
a
total
ban
on
billboards
within
a
certain
distance
of
interstate
highways?
i
suppose
it
does,
doesn't
it?
that's
also
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
the
whole
state
of
california
there,
you're
talking
about,
or
the
western
part
of
the
united
states.
no
billboards
with
100
yards
of
the
highway,
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
stevens
which
could
be
a
fortiori
unconstitutional.
justice
stevens
they've
got
to
be
very,
very
large
or
you
can't
even
see
them.
justice
stevens
mr.
sumption,
i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
the
amendment
to
the
ordinance
after
the
stipulation,
does
that
allow
the
permanent
billboards
to
be
used
for
these
political
ads?
or
is
it
something
less?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
can
they
use
the
permanent
billboard
structures
on
these
temporary
political?
justice
stevens
but
what
are
you
telling
us
here?
you
seem
to
think
it's
significant,
and
is
it
significant
in
the
sense
that
it
allows
these
billboards
to
be
used,
or
that
they
can
just
use
posters,
which
i
guess
they
could
have,
anyway?
justice
stevens
so
this
amendment
will
not
change
the
need
to
tear
down
all
the
permanent
structures?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
suppose,
as
mr.
abrams
pointed
out,
that
magazines
and
newspapers
sometimes
create
environmental
problems,
an
awful
lot
of
garbage
is
created,
and
litter,
and
trucks
driving
at
night,
waking
people
up,
throwing
to
the
newsboys,
and
all
the
rest.
i
suppose
you'd
make
the
same
kind
of
argument
for
a
total
ban
of
other
forms
of
communication
media
too,
based
on
environmental
or
esthetic
considerations?
justice
stevens
well,
i
suppose
you
could
regulate
the
size
of
structures,
size
and
shape
of
structures,
as
you
do
with
buildings,
and
say,
"no
structure",
you
know.
and
if
it's
on
the
wall
of
a
factory,
for
example,
you'd
say
it
doesn't
affect
the
structures,
just
let
them
put
a
sign
up.
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible,
it
seems
to
me,
to
conceive
of--
justice
stevens
mr.
sumption,
does
san
diego
allow
advertising
in...
do
you
have
buses
or
street
cars?
i
suppose
buses?
justice
stevens
is
there
going
to
be
advertising
in?
justice
stevens
what
about
in
your
ballpark
or
your
football
stadium?
