mr.
c.
alan
sumption
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
get
straight
at
the
outset
a
few
factual
statements
that
i
think
need
some
elucidation.
first
of
all,
the
city
of
san
diego's
ordinance
does
not
prohibit
all
off-premise
signs.
i
believe
that
was
mr.
abrams'
statement.
what
it
does
is
prohibit
certain
types
of
off-site
advertising
that
is
commonly
referred
to
as
billboards.
the
california
supreme
court
specifically
narrowed,
gave
a
narrowing
construction
to
the
ordinance,
applying
it
against
the
commercial
type
billboard,
and
indicated
that
it
would
not
apply
to
small
yard
signs
or
things
of
this
nature,
of
picket
signs
evidencing
a
labor
dispute,
things
of
this
nature.
the
stipulation
no.
28
that
mr.
abrams
refers
to
does
not
say
that
there
are
no
alternative
means
of
communication
or
advertising.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
stipulation
is
ambiguous.
secondly,
subsequent
to
entering
into
that
stipulation
the
ordinance
was
amended
to
add
i
believe
it
was
either
the
12th
or
13th
exception
to
the
signs
prohibited
by
excepting
out
temporary
political
campaign
signs,
a
rather
large
area
of
signs.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
it
strengthens
the
case,
your
honor,
because
without
it
it
would
mean,
it
would
ban
political
campaign
signs.
and
part
of
the
reason
that
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
was
that,
i
think
it's
a
commonly
known
fact
that
certain
politicians
do
make
use
of
off-site
advertising
to
advertise
their
campaigns.
and
the
last
point
on
the
stipulation
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
indicated
that
to
the
extent
that
a
person
may
feel
that
he
cannot
convey
his
message
without
the
use
of
an
off-site
billboard-type
sign,
that
that
person
could
come
in
and
challenge
the
ordinance
as
applied
to
him.
but
the
court
said
that
that
was
not
sufficient
to
strike
down
the
ordinance
on
its
face.
another
statement
was
made,
that
the
city
of
san
diego
has
agreed
somehow
that
if
you
can't
have
commercial
speech
you
can't
have
noncommercial
or
political
and
social
speech.
that's
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
city
position.
what
we
did
is,
by
way
of
argument
in
our
brief,
that
that
is
in
fact
the
position
of
the
billboard
companies.
we
just
turned
their
own
argument
around
against
them
in
the
context
of
saying
that
this
demonstrates
even
further
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
commercial
means
of
exploiting
speech;
that
the
income
behind
it
is
what
enables
the
limited
numbers
of
noncommercial
speech
to
even
exist.
we
do
not
concede
that.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
is
the
fact
that
it's
commercial
sufficient?
i
think
that's
an
important
aspect,
and
to
the
extent--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i
think
that
in
view
of
some
of
the
past
decisions
of
this
court
the
fact
that
it's
commercial
is
sufficient.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
there
are
several
reasons,
i
think,
behind
that.
first
of
all,
campaigns
come
and
go.
they
are
temporary
in
nature.
the
typical
campaign
type
poster
is
not
anywhere
near
as
extensive
as
the
permanent
billboard-type
structure
that's
there
long
after
the
message
goes.
the
courts
have
said--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--the
copy
itself
may
be
somewhat
temporary,
but
the
sign
is
there
long
after
the
message
is
gone.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
believe
that's
correct.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that's
also
my
understanding
of
the
way
they
operate
their
business.
also,
as
i
started
to
say,
the
courts
have
given
political
speech,
campaign-type
speech,
placed
it
on
the
highest
level.
and
that's
another
reason
why
campaign-type
advertising
was
excepted
out
from
the
prohibitions
of
this
ordinance.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
the
actual
language
of
the
exception
simply
says
they're
not
prohibited
by
the
ordinance,
so
it's
permanent.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
the
ordinance
is
silent
on
the
intent.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
think
that
the
logical
intent
would
be
that
political
campaign
signs
should
be
something
less
than
on
permanent
structures,
of
the
structures
remaining,
because
of
the
esthetic
justifications
and
rationale
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that
would
be
correct.
i
think
a
correct
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
it's
in
the
version
of
the
ordinance
that
is--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--it
begins
at
page
104a
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
your
honor.
and
the
actual
exception
itself
would
be
on
page
112a,
no.
12.
it's
the
last
exception
under
a
list
of
twelve
exceptions.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that
was
added,
your
honor,
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
california
supreme
court,
before
they
heard
oral
argument
the
first
time
on
the
case.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
the
california
supreme
court
had
construed
it
as
written.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
i
indicated,
the
california
supreme
court
further
narrowed
the
application
of
the
ordinance
to
make
sure
it
didn't
apply
to
such
things
as
yard
signs
and
other
non-commercial-type
signs.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
as
it
came
up,
all
the
way
up,
or
from
the
california
supreme
court
level?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
as
it
came
up,
the
trial
court
issued
summary
judgment
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
each
side
brought
motion
for
summary
judgment;
denied
the
cities,
granted
the
metromedias,
the
billboard
companies.
it
was
appealed
to
the
district
court
of
appeal,
the
intermediate
appellate
court.
they
upheld
the
trial
court's
granting
summary
judgment.
it
was
appealed
to
the--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--that
court's
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
california--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--yes,
your
honor,
and
the
california
supreme
court
did
grant
a
rehearing
on
the
case,
and
it
was
argued
a
second
time
before
the
california
supreme
court.
at
that
time
the
california
supreme
court
seemed
mostly
interested
in
an
amendment
to
the
federal
highway
beautification
act
as
it
related
to
a
compensation
question,
and
that's
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
by
the
city
of
san
diego
because
it
was
decided
against
us
by
the
california
supreme
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
cert
that's
now
pending
before
the
court,
but
not
before
it
here
today.
another
statement
that
has
been
made
here
today
by
counsel
for
metromedia
is
that
somehow
the
nature
of
a
community
and
whether
or
not
signs
are
in
commercial
versus
noncommercial
zones
areas
has
a
bearing,
if
not
a
crucial
bearing,
on
whether
or
not
billboards
can
be
kept
out
of
the
city.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
essence
the
logical
conclusion
that's
reached
from
that
statement
is
that
somehow
the
first
amendment
is
triggered
by
local
zoning.
and
of
course
zoning,
the
considerations
behind
local
zoning,
really,
are
done
for
reasons
completely
independent
from
first
amendment
and
perhaps
other
constitutional
considerations.
for
example,
there
are
some
cities,
the
largest
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
houston,
that
doesn't
even
have
zoning.
but,
what
do
you
do
in
a
city
that
doesn't
have
any
zoning?
and
along
those
lines
i
think
in
essence
what
one
is--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i'm
not
certain,
your
honor,
if
they
do.
my
guess
would
be
they
do,
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
the
other
thing
about
allowing
billboards
in
commercial
zones
but
not
in
others
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
esthetic
justification
of
the
ordinance
should
apply
equally
in
commercial
areas
because
municipalities
including
san
diego
are
recognizing
perhaps
their
past
mistakes
in
allowing
commercial
areas
to
be
eyesores
and
trying
to
improve
those
areas.
and
i
don't
think
we
should
be
doomed
to
failure
by
saying,
well,
they're
not
that
attractive
now,
we're
bound
to
leave
them
that
way.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
it's
esthetics
and
traffic
safety
and
along
the
esthetic
lines
it
is
also
to
the
extent
that
esthetics
have
an
economic
or
a
monetary
value
by
encouraging
tourists
to
come.
san
diego
is
highly
dependent
upon
its
tourist
trade,
it
being
a
coastal
city
with
beaches
and
bays,
and
upholding
land
values
and
preserving
open
space
and
public
investment
in
highways
and
landscaping
highways,
but
it's--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--it's
all
tied
into
esthetics.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
san
diego
has
attempted
to
broach
the
subject
of
regulating
signs
by
dividing
them
into
off-premise
or
off-site
and
on-site.
we
have
a
separate
ordinance
that
deals
with
on-site
signs,
and
it
does
not
allow
any
moving,
flashing,
et
cetera
type
signs.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
and
that
is
specifically,
defined,
those
public
message,
or
public
service--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--no.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
no.
they
are
controlled
by
the
on-site
sign
ordinance
which
specifically
says
they
shall
not
move
from
side
to
side,
laterally;
or--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--what
they're
talking
about
is
if
it
comes
on
and
shows
a
time
or
temperature
or
a
word
message,
but
it
cannot
appear
to
move,
and
it
cannot
have
flashing
lights.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
it
can
change,
and
i
think
there
is
some
time
period
so
that
it
isn't
just
constantly
coming
on
and
coming
off.
i
couldn't
answer
the
specifics.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
your
honor,
again
i
think
we
get
into
semantics.
i
would
answer
your
question
by
saying,
yes,
we
do
feel
it's
a
compelling
state
interest.
and,
secondly,
this
court
in
its
o'brien
decision
cited
in
our
brief
has
indicated
that
really
there's
a
series
of
four
or
five
words
that
have
been
used
almost
interchangeably:
strong,
prevailing,
substantial,
compelling.
and
they
all
basically
boil
down
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
significant.
i
don't
think
the
court
has
attempted
to
distinguish
by
giving
a
special
definition.
basically,
the
idea
is
that
it's
a
strong
interest
that
supports
the
legislation.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
follow
that
a
state
can't
pass.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
and
i
think--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--yes,
i
think
it's
very
difficult.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
am
defending
it
as
time,
place,
and
manner,
and
that's
where
we
get
into--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--and
that's
where
we
get
into
the
other
semantical--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--first
of
all,
mr.
justice
marshall,
what
we're
talking
about
is
signs,
more
specifically
off-site
signs.
and
more
specifically
yet,
a
specific
type
of
off-site
sign
known
as
a
billboard.
now,
off-site
signs
are
allowed
by
this
ordinance.
they
are
not
totally
prohibited.
the
particular
type
of
sign,
the
manner
of
use
of
a
particular
type
of
sign,
a
billboard,
is
prohibited.
it
depends
now
on
how
you
look
at
it.
we
contend
we're
regulating
off-site
signs.
we
allow
some
and
we
do
not
allow
others.
and
secondly,
i
don't
think
the
compelling
state
interest
test
or
whatever
has
any
bearing
on
whether
or
not
it's...
or
rather,
that
the
time,
place,
and
manner
test
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there's
a
total
prohibition.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that's
the
kind
of
semantical
problem,
i
think,
that
we
get
into
when
we
start
putting
these
in
categories
like
"total
prohibition",
"total
ban".
but
time,
place,
and
manner,
as
i
understand
the
court's
decisions,
is
really
a
means
of
distinguishing
from
a
regulation
that's
attempting
to
get
at
the
content
of
speech,
when
we're
talking
about
first
amendment
rights.
and
it's
clear
that
we're
not
dealing
with
the
primary
effects
of
a
particular
message
that's
being
advertised
on
a
billboard.
as
stated
in
the
linmark
case,
we're
talking
about
the
adverse
secondary
effects
from
the
manner
in
which
the
messages
are
portrayed
or
put
before
the
public.
and
therefore
it
is
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation.
furthermore,
because
of
the
blight
that
they
have
aesthetically,
you
know,
we
talk
about
more
narrowly
drawn
measures,
which
mr.
abrams
has
mentioned,
saying
that
this
is
not
narrowly
drawn
because
this
is
a
total
ban;
we
get
into
subjective
decisions
on,
for
example,
well,
let's
talk
about
the
height,
or
the
square
footage
of
the
sign.
if
we
were
to
put
a
regulation
in
either
of
those
two
respects
or
the
distance
between
billboards,
the
next
thing
you
have
is,
well,
if
we
have
1,000
feet
between
billboards,
why
not
900
feet?
it
could
have
been
more
narrowly
drawn,
and
you
go
on
and
on
and
on.
i
think
that
these
things--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--that's
correct.
these
things
are
debatable,
and
better
left
to
the
legislative
discretion,
especially
when
you're
in
the
area
of
esthetics.
where
we've
been
damned
because
the
ordinance
is
overinclusive,
we've
been
damned
because
it's
underinclusive,
and
these
are
the
types
of
legislative
judgments
that
necessarily
have
to
be
made
when
one
attempts
to
deal
with
a
problem
of
this
sort.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
but
the
distinction
between
that
category
of
case
is
that
the
problem
can
really
be
dealt
with.
the
problem
is,
in
one
instance,
litter.
and
you
can
easily
pass
an
ordinance
that
makes
it
against
the
law
to
litter.
it's
not
the
handing
of
the
message,
the
leaflet,
to
somebody
that
should
be
banned,
because
people
may
want
that
message
and
somebody
else
may
want
to
convey
it.
but
it's
you
know,
the
dropping
of
it
on
the
ground
and
leaving
it
there
that's
the
problem.
i
don't
think
we
have
that
type
of
situation
with
the
billboard.
how
can
we
better,
more
narrowly,
get
at
the
problem?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
think
you're
right
and
i
think
different
people
could
differ
on
that
type
of
thing.
you
know,
what
steps
could
be
taken
that
would
make
the
appearance
better.
but
again,
i
think
we're
in
an
area
that
we're...
you
know,
a
city
can
be
second-guessed.
in
instances
where
cities
have
regulated
billboards
the
same
first
amendment
arguments
are
raised,
simply
because
if
it
hurts
the
standardized
manner
in
which
they
do
business,
the
billboard
companies,
the
way
they
do
business,
then
suddenly
the
first
amendment
crops
up.
i
think
to
a
large
degree
their
argument
is
predicated
upon
economics.
the
reason
why
they
say--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--does
los
angeles
ban
billboards?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
could
they?
i
think
they
could.
certainly.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes.
i
don't
think
it
depends
on
the
particular
facts
of
a
particular
city.
i
think
the
things
are
a
blight
on
any
community
and
i
think
the
communities...
and
to
the
extent
that
traffic
safety
is
involved,
the
same
considerations.
they're
put
there
on
a
highway
intended
with
all
the
art
and
skill
of
the
manufacturers
to
make
people
driving
in
automobiles
look
at
them.
to
the
extent
that
that
causes
a
momentary
distraction,
there's
a
potential
for
some
sort
of
action.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
there
are
certain
things
that
obviously,
you
know,
we
just
can't
get
rid
of
women.
we're
stuck,
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
with
women
walking
down
the
street.
it
would
seem
to
me,
as
i
indicated,
to
a
large
extent
the
arguments
set
forth
by
the
billboard
companies
are
predicated,
though,
upon
where
they
want
to
be,
where
it's
advantageous
to
them
to
be
to
make
money.
and
to
the
extent
that
we
keep
them
out
of
areas
that
they
feel
they
need
to
be
in
for
the
economics
of
the
system
to
present
a
showing,
as
set
forth
in
the
stipulated
facts,
that
national
advertisers
buy
a
program
of
local
exposure
throughout
a
community.
their
argument
that,
what
if
a
community
has
one
small
commercial
area?
and
they
say
they
have
a
right
to
be
in
the
commercial
area.
they
probably
wouldn't
want
to
be
there,
because
one
sign
in
one
small
commercial
area
isn't
going
to
be
monetarily
feasible
to
them.
so
i
think,
to
a
large
degree
those
arguments
are
not
predicated
upon
the
effect
of
the
first
amendment,
but
upon--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--to
that
extent,
i
think
they're
incorrect.
i
don't--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--the
first
amendment
does
compel
that.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes.
this
court
has
never
held
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
a
particular
mode
of
expression
or
the
most
cost-efficient
means
of
getting
a
message
across,
and
to
the
extent
that
these
signs
are
intrusive
and
in
effect
invade
the
very
privacy
of
people
that
are
unwilling
to
receive
the
messages,
there's
no
ability
to
refuse
the
message,
as
there
is
in
virtually
every
other
means
of
communication.
and
when
billboard
companies
say
this
is
a
unique
means
of
communication,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
them
in
the
sense
that
it
is
unique,
because
it's
making
use
of
public
highways
and
forcing
the
message
upon
the
public,
taxpayers
that
pay
for
beautification
of
the
highways
and
yet,
you
know,
may
not
choose
to
have
the
messages
forced
on
them.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
we
have
buses
and
we
are
soon
to
have
a
street
car
system
in
san
diego.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
there
is
advertising,
and
that's
on
buses,
and
the
signs...
specifically
exempts
that
category
of
off-site
advertising
as
well
as
on
taxicabs
and
other
vehicles.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
there
has
been...
that's
been
a
matter
of
controversy.
i
believe
that
at
the
present
time
there
are
some
advertisement
panels
that
face
in
to
the
stadium
but
are
not
visible
from
the
public
rights-of-way
outside
the
stadium,
and
i
believe
that
those
messages
change
to
some
degree,
but
i
think
for
the
most
part
they
stay
there
either
for
quite
a
while
or
semi-permanently.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that's
correct.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i
would
just
conclude
by
saying
that
i
think
that
justifications
have
been
set
forth
and
that
this
case
is
not
easily
squeezed
into
mechanical
principles
of
other
first
amendment
cases.
this
is
not
a
content-based
ordinance,
and
the
principles
that
are
cited
by
counsel
for
billboard
companies
have
been
applied
in
a
very
different
context,
and
i
don't
think
that
they're
applicable
or
binding
in
this
fact
situation.
and
i
would
close
on
that
note.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
thank
you,
your
honor.
