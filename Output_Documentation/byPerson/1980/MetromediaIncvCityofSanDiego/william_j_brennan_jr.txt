mr.
abrams,
does
your
approach
suggest
that
the
analysis
is
time,
place,
and
manner,
rather
than
content?
rather
than
compelling
state
interest?
justice
jr.
whether
as
commercial
advertising,
ideological
or
whatever?
justice
jr.
where
can
we
find
that?
justice
jr.
to
the
extent
you're
admitting
that
there
may
be
situations
where
such
bans
might
be
constitutional,
at
least
presenting
no
first
amendment
difficulties,
is
this
because
in
those
situations
you
think
your
test
for
compelling
state
interest
could
be
satisfied?
i
gathered
from
what
you
answered
me
earlier,
the
analysis
you
suggested
to
us
has
to
be
in
terms,
if
there's
to
be
any
support
for
the
regulation
of
san
diego,
of
compelling
state
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
will
you
agree
that
the
ban
may
be
constitutional,
anyway?
justice
jr.
well,
i
thought,
as
time,
place,
and
manner
ordinarily
does
apply
a
significant
state
interest
standard
rather
than
compelling,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
but,
mr.
abrams,
if
in
the
williamsburg
case,
to
the
extent
you
say
that
the
ban
does
not
offend
the
first
amendment,
it
has
to
be
because
esthetics
around
williamsburg
might
be
said
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
jr.
is
that
the
reason?
justice
jr.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
first
amendment
analysis
that
you're
submitting
to
us.
justice
jr.
if
you
concede
that
that
might
be,
at
least,
i
think
you've
said,
a
constitutional,
notwithstanding,
a
first
amendment
attack,
on
your
submission
isn't
this
because
the
state
interest
there
is
compelling,
in
esthetics?
justice
jr.
of
proving
what?
by
what
standard?
justice
jr.
is
san
diego's
only
justification
here
the
esthetic
one?
justice
jr.
but
that's
in
the
content
of
esthetics?
justice
jr.
now,
is
san
diego
submitting
that
its
esthetic
justification
is
a
compelling
state
interest
or
something
less?
justice
jr.
significant?
justice
jr.
since
the
ban
is
a
total
one,
i
gather
you're
not
defending
this
as
a
time,
place,
and
manner
justification?
justice
jr.
oh,
i
see.
even
though
it's
a
total
ban?
