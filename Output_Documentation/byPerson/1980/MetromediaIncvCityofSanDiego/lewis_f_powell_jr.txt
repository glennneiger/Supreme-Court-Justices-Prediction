justice
jr.
mr.
abrams,
may
i
add
one
more
easy
hypothetical?
what
would
you
think
of
an
ordinance
adopted
by
the
city
government
of
washington,
d.c.,
that
dealt
with
billboards
of
this
character
in
downtown
washington.
would
that
ordinance
banning...
i
suppose
there
may
be
one;
i
don't
recall
seeing
any
such
ads...
would
that
ordinance
be
subject
to
the
same
infirmities
that
you
suggest
for
this
one?
justice
jr.
what
about
pennsylvania
avenue?
justice
jr.
that
area;
that
area,
downtown
washington.
justice
jr.
mr.
abrams,
perhaps
we
haven't
given
you
very
much
time
to
argue
your
own
case
but
i
might
relieve
you
of
any
apprehension
about
colonial
williamsburg.
there
is
an
ordinance
in
that
town
which
says
that
nothing
may
be
located
within
a
historic
area
that
wasn't
there
in
the
18th
century.
were
there
any
billboards
in
the
18th
century?
justice
jr.
but
not
in
the
historic--
justice
jr.
where
do
we
find
the
amendment,
in
the
papers
we
have?
justice
jr.
on
page
106a?
justice
jr.
and
when
was
that
added?
justice
jr.
so
that
is
before
us?
justice
jr.
112a,
i
think
you
said?
