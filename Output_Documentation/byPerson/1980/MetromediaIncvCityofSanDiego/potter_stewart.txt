justice

mr.
abrams,
i
gather
that
you
concede,
at
least
implicitly,
that
outdoor
advertising
could
constitutionally
be
banned
in
a
residential
area?
justice
stewart
some
communities
are
zoned
entirely
residential?
justice
stewart
some
governmental
entities
are,
almost?
justice
stewart
some
governmental
entities
are
so-called
bedroom
communities,
under
the
law
entirely
residential.
justice
stewart
so
the
size
and
characteristics
of
san
diego
are
relevant?
justice
stewart
a
sound
truck
wouldn't
either.
justice
stewart
well,
now,
mr.
abrams,
zoning
ordinances
and
zoning
laws
typically
if
not
universally
ban
outdoor
advertising
from
residential
areas
throughout
the
country.
and
you're
not
here
taking
any
issue
with
such
laws
as
that,
are
you?
justice
stewart
but
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
it's
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation,
if
it's
a
total
prohibition.
justice
stewart
it's
self-contradictory.
justice
stewart
but
your
basic
answer,
mr.
abrams,
i
think
is
that
it
would
depend
upon
what
you
produced
by
the
evidence
in
such
a
case.
justice
stewart
because
esthetic
considerations
of
the
governmental
entity
are
minimal
within
such
an
area.
justice
stewart
let
me...
this
test,
this
so-called
test,
i'm
sure,
is
meaningful
to
many
members
of
the
court
and
maybe
to
every
member
of
the
court
except
one,
but
to
at
least
one
it
is
no
test
whatsoever.
well,
and
if...
i
don't
know
if
my
brother
stewart
referred
to
himself
or
to
me
but
if
he
referred
to
himself
he
can
add
me.
mr.
abrams,
i
suppose
we'd
all
acknowledge
and
recognize
that
radio
and
television
advertising
is
a
multibillion
dollar
business
today.
could
congress
totally
ban
all
advertising
on
radio
and
television?
justice
stewart
the
history
of
this
case
was
that
it
was...
i
know,
in
the
california
supreme
court,
there
was
but
one
dissenter.
as
it
came
up
through
the
court
system
what
was
the
case's
history?
justice
stewart
no,
as
it
came
up
through
the
california
court
system?
justice
stewart
that
court's
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california--
justice
stewart
--in
which
justice
clark
dissented.
justice
stewart
does
houston
have
outdoor
advertising
in
some
areas?
justice
stewart
last
time
i
was
there
they
did.
maybe
they're
gone
now.
justice
stewart
and
the
claim
could
be
made
that
it's
a
total
ban
of
any
billboard
in
that
1,000-foot
stretch?
justice
stewart
well,
the
arguments
are
that
the
first
amendment
protects
their
freedom
to
do
exactly
as
they
wish
in
this
regard
in
the
commercial
and
industrial
areas,
at
least,
of
san
diego.
it's
not
simply
that
they
want
to
do
it,
but
it's
that
the
first
amendment
protects
their
freedom
to
do
it.
justice
stewart
i
know
you
do.
justice
stewart
at
least
it's
that
argument.
justice
stewart
of
course,
in
that
area
there
would
be
no
traffic
safety
arguments,
i
would
assume?
justice
stewart
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
sumption,
i
for
one
would
like
to
congratulate
you
for
getting
through
an
entire
argument
without
using
the
word
analysis.
