justice
blackmun
mr.
abrams,
is
the
joint
stipulation
of
facts
in
the
joint
appendix
the
same
stipulation?
justice
blackmun
i'd
prefer
to
use
it
because
the
one
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
has
an
amazing
word
"prohibitilly"
in
there.
justice
blackmun
it's
corrected
in
the
other
one
and
i
think
the
joint
stipulation
probably
is
the
preferred
one
to
use,
the
one
in
the
joint
appendix.
justice
blackmun
you
were
not
a
party
to
it,
anyway.
justice
blackmun
do
you
think
that
amendment
strengthens
or
hurts
your
case?
justice
blackmun
mr.
sumption,
let
me
get
back
to
your
amendments.
what
justification
is
there
for
exempting
a
temporary
political
campaign
sign,
but
prohibiting
other
political
signs
such
as
are
demonstrated
in
the
jurisdictional
statement?
justice
blackmun
i
take
it
that
this
one
on
"welcome
to
san
diego,
home
of
the
1,100
underpaid
cops.
"
is
somewhat
temporary?
justice
blackmun
wasn't
there
a
campaign
on
for
an
increase
in
the
salary
of
city
employees?
