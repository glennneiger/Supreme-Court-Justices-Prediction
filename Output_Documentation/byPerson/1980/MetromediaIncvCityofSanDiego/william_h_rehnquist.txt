justice
rehnquist
but
it's
a
medium
of
communication
that
is
made
a
medium
of
communication
only
by
the
fact
that
the
city
has
put
in
roads
which
lead
past
the
billboard,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
if
you
had
an--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
you
wouldn't
have
a
big
billboard
50
miles
out
in
the
desert
where
no
one
could
see
it.
justice
rehnquist
but
a
billboard
wouldn't
be
constructed
before
the
road
was
there.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
supposing
that
the
city
of
san
diego,
instead
of
barring
outside
advertising,
had
barred
dirigibles
from
coming
below
a
500-foot
level
over
the
city
limits,
which
carried
signs
similar
to
billboard
signs?
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
all
know
that
goodyear
or
goodrich,
i
forget
which
it
is,
blimp.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
accept
the
validity
of
both
the
saia
and
the
kovacs
decisions?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abrams,
in
your
answer
to
justice
powell's
question
a
moment
ago,
you
said
that
if
it
were
federal
land
here
in
the
district
involved,
it
perhaps
could
be
sustained.
and
yet
the
first
amendment
is
directed
against
the
federal
government,
and
it
presumably
incorporated
only
by
the
fourteenth
as
against
the
states.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
federal
government
has
more
right
to
ban
than
the
states?
justice
rehnquist
what
is
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
rehnquist
but
if
they
succeed
in
getting
their
raise,
presumably
the
owner
of
the
billboard
will
just
find
another
customer
to
put
another
message
on?
justice
rehnquist
well,
large
parts
of
the
entire
state
of
vermont
are
regulated
in
such
a
manner
that
there
may
be
no
billboards
whatever
except
a
sign
white
on
black,
two
feet
high
and
three
feet
wide,
and
on
site.
and
i
suppose
one
could
say
there's
a
total
ban
of
all
billboard
advertising
except
that
kind
of
sign?
