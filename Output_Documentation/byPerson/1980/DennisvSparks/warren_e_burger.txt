chief
justice

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
dennis
v.
sparks
and
lynd.
mr.
edmonds,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
it
has
a
little
bit
of
jurisdiction
on
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
it's
comparable
to,
analogous
to
the
posture
of
a
united
states
senator
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
that
he
may
not
be
questioned
in
any
other
place?
chief
justice
burger
but
we
don't
have
a
speech
or
debate
clause
typed
for
judges,
do
we?
chief
justice
burger
that's
a
judicially
constructive
concept.
chief
justice
burger
as
you
say,
on
your
submission,
it's
a
matter
almost
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
burger
let's
assume...
can't
we
start
with
an
assumption
that
this
judge
is
immune
and
go
on
to
your
client
who
is
not
a
judge,
is
he?
chief
justice
burger
--vicarious
exemption,
if
it
is
an
exemption?
chief
justice
burger
what
would
be
your
analysis
if
the
united
states...
a
member
of
the
united
states
congress,
house
or
senate,
was
involved
in
a
conspiracy
with
a
private
citizen
and
then
the
private
citizen
is
a
defendant,
but
not
the
member
of
congress?
do
you
think
the
speech
or
debate
clause
could
carry
over
to
the
coconspirator
who
was
not
protected
by
the
speech
or
debate
clause
directly?
chief
justice
burger
i
must
say
that
here
because
if
it
isn't
true
there
it
couldn't
possibly
be
true
here,
could
it
be?
chief
justice
burger
incidentally,
has
he
been
prosecuted?
yes,
this
judge
is
in
jail,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
burger
has
manges
been
prosecuted?
chief
justice
burger
but
he
hasn't
been
prosecuted
criminally?
do
you
know
why
not?
chief
justice
burger
it
happened
to
be.
but
if
there
were
several
actions
that
followed
before
she
arrived,
it
would
seem
clear
that
they
would
have
to
come
as
witnesses.
chief
justice
burger
well--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
burger
--i
take
it
you
would
not
agree
with
your
friend
that
a
coconspirator
with
a
member
of
congress
would
have
the
cloak
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause
around
him?
chief
justice
burger
you
could
concede
the
former
arguendo,
and
still--
chief
justice
burger
--maintain
your
position?
chief
justice
burger
are
there
not
many
situations
in
which
a
sitting
judge
might
be
subpoenaed
and
required
to
spend
time
in
court
as
a
witness,
either
to
an
automobile
accident
or
to
a
rule
that
he
had
drawn
when
he
was
in
private
practice,
or
even
when
he
was
on
the
bench
ruling?
chief
justice
burger
his
immunity
is
a
narrow
immunity
relating
to--
chief
justice
burger
--his
judicial
functions.
chief
justice
burger
using
a
parallel,
mr.
smith,
with
many
of
the
suits
against
cabinet
officers,
now
under
the
new
statutes
a
cabinet
officer
may
be
sued
in
any
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
country
and--
chief
justice
burger
--including
hawaii
and
alaska.
and
haven't
the
courts
seen
to
it
that
their
testimony
can
be
taken
by
deposition
and
by
interrogatory
and
not
drag
them
away
from
their
cabinet
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
edmonds?
chief
justice
burger
even
with
the
explicit,
very
explicit
immunity
and
protection
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
a
member
of
congress
can
be
sued
under
1983
or
in
many
other
ways,
and
that
doesn't
stop
that
exposure.
chief
justice
burger
yes
but
he
isn't
immune
from
having
someone
file
a
complaint
with
a
lot
of
scurrilous
allegations.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
