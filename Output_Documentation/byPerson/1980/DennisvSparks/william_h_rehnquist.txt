justice
rehnquist
isn't
immunity
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
rehnquist
so
what
if
the
judge
is
served
with
a
complaint
in
an
action
such
as
this
and
simply
lets
the
time
for
answer
go
by
and
a
default
judgment
is
taken
against
him?
would
you
say
that
that
judgment
is
no
good?
justice
rehnquist
so,
even
if
he
said
i
want
to
answer
this
on
the
merits
and
clear
my
name
of
these
allegations
in
the
complaint
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
so
under
your
theory?
justice
rehnquist
the
judge
is
home
free?
justice
rehnquist
is
the
judge
liable
under
texas
law,
under
the
wrongful
injunction
action?
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
immunity
doctrine
is
that
it's
awfully
hard
to
separate
out,
you
know,
before
you
go
to
trial
and
appeal,
and
so
forth,
the
honorable
judge
who
made
a
mistake
in
his
ruling
and
the
corrupt
judge
who's
been
jailed
for
theft.
justice
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
made
at
the
time
you
filed
your
1983
action,
was
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
happened
to
the...
in
this...
in
this
case,
mr.
smith,
before
any
of
the
texas
proceedings
had
taken
place,
your
client
filed
his
1983
action
and
the
judge
was
asked
to
give
a
deposition
and
said
he
had
cases
set
for
all
week
and
all
the
next
week,
and
your
client
said
well,
i
planned
that
the
deposition
is
going
to
last
at
least
two
weeks
so
you
had
better
adjourn
that
calendar.
and
the
federal
judge
said
you're
going
to
have
to
participate
in
these
depositions
and
if
it
takes
two
weeks,
it
takes
two
weeks.
justice
rehnquist
but
certainly
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
opinion
would
include
many
cases
in
which
you
did
need
the
testimony
of
the
judge?
justice
rehnquist
well
but
that
hasn't
been
the
way...
1983
has
worked
in
the
past,
is
that
you
get
a
judgment
against
the
judge
and
then
he,
in
turn,
turns
around
and
sues
the
person
who
sues
him.
justice
rehnquist
it
has
made
up
for
lost
time,
though.
justice
rehnquist
couldn't
you
say
the
same
about
judicial
immunity,
that
it
almost
invites
a
judge
to
be
corrupt?
justice
rehnquist
so
long
as
the
pleader
told
the
truth?
justice
rehnquist
--and
he
clearly
had
the
authority
to
enter
an
injunction?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
the
public
interest
rationale
is
meant
to
kind
of
put
up
a
facade
to
the
public
that
all
judges
are
much
more
honest
than
normal
people?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
public
interest
connection--
