mr.
garland
f.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question,
i
think,
is
pretty
before
the
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
private
individuals
who
do
conspire
with
a
state
judge
and
do
cause
the
state
judge
to
enter
the
bench
and
enter
unlawful
orders
that
result
in
damage
to
the
claim...
do
they
automatically
derive
immunity
for
their
wrongdoing
simply
because
the
judge
is,
himself,
immune?
now,
this
case,
of
course,
is
before
your
honors
as...
on
the
pleadings,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
pleadings,
of
course,
have
to
be
taken
as
true.
but
we
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
there's
nothing
in
these
pleadings,
in
this
case,
that
has
not
already
been
adjudicated
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
bribery
was
adjudicated,
on
a
motion
to
disqualify
judge
carrillo.
the
comments
of
the
judge,
after
both
parties
had
rested
is
included
and
attached
to
our
pleadings,
which
is
in
the
appendix.
and
the
order
that
the
judge
entered,
holding
that
the
judge
was
disqualified
because
the
transactions
between
the
judge
and
mr.
manges
amounted
to
a
disqualifying
situation...
that's
been
decided.
now,
judge
carrillo
has,
subsequently,
been
impeached
by
the
texas
legislature.
the
house
included
the
transactions
involved
in
the
disqualification
matter
as
one
of
the
articles
of
impeachment...
there
were
12
articles,
but
this
is
only
one
of
them.
he
was
convicted
by
the
texas
senate
and
removed
from
office
for
corruption,
various
items.
he
was
later
tried
and
convicted
in
federal
court
for
tax
fraud.
thereafter,
he
was
tried
and
convicted
in
the
texas
state
courts
for
theft.
now
we
are
not
here
on
a
jailhouse-type
pleading
that's
accusing
an
honorable
judge
and
trying
to
besmirch
the
character
of
an
honorable
judge
who
simply
made
an
error
in
one
of
his
rulings.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
think
learned
hand
addressed
that
question
in
one
of
his
decisions.
he
said
that
if
you
could
determine
that,
then
it
would
be
monstrous
not
to
allow
relief.
now,
in
this
case,
that
determination
has
been
made;
we're
not
before
you--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--oh
yes.
it
was
made
then.
now,
at
the
time
the
wrongful
injunction
was
issued,
the
attorneys
who
represented
the
respondents
in
that
case...
which
was
not
our
firm...
the
attorneys
who
represented
the
respondents
in
that
case
did
not
know
of
the
bribery.
the
bribery
itself
was
not
determined
until
may
the
20th,
1973.
but
the
judge
who
made
the
determination
said
that
because
of
the
bribery,
the
judge
was
disqualified
as
of
february
1,
1971.
now,
the
wrongful
injunction
came
after
that
date,
so
the
wrongful
injunction
came
after
the
judge
had
accepted
the
bribe
and
after
he
was
disqualified
because
of
it.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
how's
that?
mr.
garland
f.
smith
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
oh
yes,
i'm
going
to
address
that.
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
don't
think
that
is
exactly
parallel.
the
congressional
immunity
is
based
on
a
specific
constitutional
provision.
the
judicial
immunity
is
based
on
common
law.
and
the...
the
exception
being--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--yes,
i
would
say--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
would
say
it's
irrelevant
to
our
position.
the
civil
rights
act,
in
dealing
with
this
matter,
they
did
not
specifically
make
an
exception.
but
in
approaching
our
problem,
we
have
to
start
with
the
civil
rights
act.
and
that
of
course
does
not
make
an
exception
even
of
the
judge.
but
the
court,
in
construing
that
statute,
concluded
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
abolish
the
common
law
immunities
that
existed
at
that
time,
and
the
immunities
did
exist
for
judges.
but
no
immunity
existed
for
those
who
conspire
with
judges,
under
common
law.
so
therefore,
the
rationale
that
supports
the
immunity
for
the
judges
does
not
in
any
way
give
any
immunity
whatever--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--your
honor,
that
was
the
case
when
this
was
first
briefed.
but
it
has
been
three
circuits
that
have
changes
their
minds
and
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
are
now
on
our
side.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
the
seventh
has
changed
its
mind.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
construe
lucas
v.
vanderwater
as--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--no,
that's
a
subsequent
case.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
okay,
this
was
decided
in
april
of--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--okay.
i
would
say
that
the
tenth
circuit,
in
norton
v.
ledell.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well,
you're
correct,
it
was
not
a
change
of
mind,
but
it
is...
at
issue--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--it's
the
addition
of
another
circuit.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
the
fifth
has,
specifically.
and
you
add
them
all
up,
i
would
say
the
circuits
that
now
support
our
position
are
the
seventh...
now,
i
construed
that
en
banc
decision.
you
have
to...
you
have
to
analyze
about
seven
different
specific
decisions,
but
when
you
tabulate
the
vote,
i
think
they
have
come
down
pretty
hard--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
suppose
i
know
they
are,
but--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
correct.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
that's
right.
but
there
you
end.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
don't
think--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well
those
cases,
i
say,
were
not
really
thought
through
very
much;
they
weren't
presented
very
well,
they
were
mostly
pro
se
cases,
and
the
court
took
an
easy
way
out
to
get
rid
of
frivolous
cases.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well,
your
honor,
number
one,
judges
are
amenable
to
subpoena
and
to
testimony
in
texas,
and
we
haven't
had
any
problem
with
it
in
texas.
the
rules
of
procedure
give
ample
opportunity
for
any
witness
to
be
protected
from
harassment,
and
that
would
certainly
be
doubly
true
with
respect
to
judges.
now,
that's
number
one.
and
number
two
is
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
case
because
we
don't
have
to
have
judge
carrillo's
testimony
in
this
case.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
yes,
i
would
say
that
they
discussed
that
question
and
they
said
the
inconvenience
to
the
judges
would
be
relatively
insignificant,
when
you
compare
the
disadvantages
of
not
having
this
ruse...
of
allowing
derivative
immunity.
so,
that's
the
way
they
disposed
of
it.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
the
fact
that
he's
a
judge
doesn't
mean
that
he's
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
and
has
an
obligation
to
his
citizenship.
if
he
has
knowledge
of
crime
or
anything
else
that's
been
committed
that...
and
he's
the
only
person
that
can
testify,
sure
he
ought
to
testify.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
it's
just
designed
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
court.
now
when
you
get
down
to
what
the
immunity
really
is
after,
the
end
is
integrity.
now
independence
is
only
the
means...
now,
it's
an
important
means;
if
the
judge
is
not
independent
he
possibly
cannot
be
entirely
fair
and
impartial
and
free
in
his
decisions.
but
if
he
uses
his
independence
as
a
means
of
aiding
corruption
as
happened
in
this
case,
then
to
say
that
you
exalt
the
independence
of
the
judge
over
and
above
and
make
it
more
important
than
integrity,
then
you
are
reversing
the
whole
application.
now--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--that...
it
would,
yes,
but
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
the
law.
but
if
we
are
free
to
proceed
against
those
who
conspire
with
the
judge
and
those
who
corrupted
him,
they
are
not
completely
left
out
in
the
cold.
now,
the...
i
don't
think
anyone
argues
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
justified
on
any
basis
except
to
preserve
an
independent
judiciary
and
the
integrity
of
the
courts
against
fallacious
and
frivolous
charges.
and
if
we
are
allowed
to
proceed
against
those
who
corrupted
the
judge,
then
we're
still
not
completely
left
out
in
the
cold.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
there
is
no
way
you
can
keep
frivolous
lawsuits
from
being
filed
in
any
field.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
now
i
think
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
mcfarland
case,
probably
has
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
proper
rule
to
take
care
of
that.
you're
going
to
have
frivolous
lawsuits
unless
you
have
rules
of
procedure
that
can
take
care
of
them.
now
that
question,
really,
is
not
reached
in
this
case.
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
have
some
stringent
rules
on
a
case
of
this
kind,
and
the
seventh
circuit
has
said
so.
and
we
have
pled
our
case,
specifically,
and
in
great
particularity,
so
that
it
would
satisfy
the
stringent
requirements
that
are
made
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
we
don't
argue
with
that.
we
think
they
ought
to
have
those
stringent
requirements.
i
don't
think
anybody
ought
to
just
be
able
to
sit
down
and
think
up
a
bunch
of
charges
to
make
against
a
judge,
and
file
suit.
i
think
that--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--you
can
sue
the
private
citizen
and
he's
the
one...
you
should
be
able
to
get
most
of
your
testimony
from
him
without
having
to
go
to
the
judge,
but
if
there
is
something
that
the
judge
feels
like
he's
got
an
interest
in
it,
he
can
always--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well
the
seventh
circuit
says--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well
of
course,
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
you
can't
stop
them
from
filing
a
complaint--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--but
you
can
stop
them
from
carrying
it
on
to
the
point
that
it
becomes
a
nuisance.
the
trial
judge,
i
think,
can
determine--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--by
dealing
with
the...
well--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well
that
would
be
right,
that
would
be
right
if
it
was
suit
against
the
judge.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
but
this
is
not
a
suit
against
the
judge,
this
is
a
suit
against
the
people
that
bribed
him.
so
you
don't
have
that
problem,
it's
just
not--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well,
that
issue
was
faced
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
requirement
of
specific
pleadings,
of
course,
puts
the
trial
judge
in
a
position
to
dismiss
the
case
if
it
isn't
pled
with
particularity,
and
mannered...
or
where
it
overcomes
the
idea
that
it
is
a
frivolous
lawsuit.
that's
really
not
too
hard
for
the
trial
judge
to
do.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well,
of
course,
if
it
is
a
malicious
dealing,
the
defendant
has
some
action
against
the
parties
that
filed
malicious
litigation.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well
of
course,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
1983
didn't
really
function
until
about
the
last
twenty
years,
and
it's--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well,
very
likely
it
has...
the
dam
broke
when
they
tried
the
first
case,
and
it's
to
be
expected
when
anything
is
held
back
that
long,
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
litigation.
but
they
are
being
weeded
out,
if...
if
you...
i
don't
think
it's
that
serious.
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
civil
case
you
are
in
an
entirely
different
situation
than
you
are
with
the
fellow
in
the
penitentiary
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
but
sit
around
there
and
work
around
in
the
library,
and
figure
out
ways
he
can
try
to
bring
a
case
before
the
court.
you're
dealing
with
people
that
have
been
suing
in
the
state
court;
they've
had
lawyers
involved
with
it,
and
they
are
not...
no
lawyer
is
going
to
get
strung
out
with
a
judge
on
a
case
unless
he
has
valid
grounds.
i've
been
practicing
for
43
years--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--and
this
is
the
first
time
i've
ever
had
a
case--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
realize
that
there
has
been
a
flow
of
frivolous
cases,
and
you
have
had
to
deal
with
them.
but
what
i--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--what
i
am
saying
is,
as
long
as
the
courts
are
going
to
consider
the
frivolous
cases,
i
don't
think
they
ought
to
throw
my
meritorious
case
out
with
the
bad.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
it
does
if
we
sue
the
judge,
we're
not
suing
the
judge.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
no,
we...
now,
let
me
answer
that
question.
in
the
first
place,
they
say
that
the
judge
is
not
a
person
so
far
as
1983
is
concerned.
well
of
course
that's
a
fiction,
he
is
a
person.
he
may
be
an
immune
person
but
he's
a
person.
and
the
fact
that
he
is
immune
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
his
capacity
to
conspire;
he
has
full
capacity
to
conspire,
he
has
full
capacity
to
commit
any
criminal
act
that
any
individual
has.
and
so
he's...
the
idea
that
he's
not
a
person
is
just,
it's
just
a
fiction,
not
even
valid
legal
fiction.
but
now,
when
you
get
past
that,
he
has
conspired
and
by
virtue
of
his
conspiracy,
our
clients
have
been
denied
their
right
to
try
their
case
before
a
fair
and
impartial
judge
because
the
case
was
tried
before
a
bribed
judge.
now
that's
not
what
the
constitution
guarantees.
we're
not
here
arguing
with
the
idea
of
an
independent
judiciary...
we're
here
because
we
didn't
get
a
fair
and
impartial
judge,
to
begin
with.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
simple.
corruption
isn't
restricted
to
duval
county,
texas.
i
read
in
the
paper
the
other
day
that
some
judge
up
in
ohio
i
believe,
had
been
removed
from
office.
the
corruption
they
recited
in
that
case
looked
like
it
was
just
as
bad
as
duval
county.
so
we've
got
to
be
able
to
deal
with
it
when
it
happens
where
it
happens.
and
we
cannot
use
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
and
derivative
immunity
to
provide
a
cover-up
for...
judicial
corruption...
if
there's
judicial
corruption
that
is
one
place,
where--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--frankly,
i
don't
see
any
way
around
that.
if
the
judge
is
just
corrupt
by
himself.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
my
opinion
is
that
there
hasn't
been
enough
case
law
on
it
to
answer
the
question.
i
think
it's--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
would
guess
that
the
texas
courts
will
come
down
pretty
much
the
same
way
you
have
here.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
oh
no,
no.
no
derivative
immunity
at
all,
under
texas
law,
that
i
know
of.
i'm
sure
they
haven't
had
any.
and
but
then,
you
get
past
that
and
get
into
derivative
immunity,
and
the
cases
that
have
considered
it
and
decided
against
it
begin...
like
this,
number
one
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
doesn't
provide
for
derivative
immunity
because
it
says
any
person--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--or
for
judicial
immunity.
but
judicial
immunity
has
been
provided
under
the
theory
that
it
existed
in
common
law.
now
derivative
immunity
did
not
exist
in
common
law.
so
therefore,
the
cases
that
have
held
that
the
judge--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--that...
you
mean
there
was
a
common
law
question?
my
research
has
failed
to
disclose
a
single
case--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
have
had
numerous
law
review
articles
and
i
have
seen
the
quotation
in
cases
and
in
briefs
and
so
forth,
that
there
was
no
derivative
immunity
at
common
law.
now,
i
can't
cite
you
a
case
that
says...
that
specifically
says
that...
that
was
a
british
case,
as
of
the
date
of...
1983.
now
the
next
thing
is,
that
any
such
immunity
that
is
awarded
to
the
private
individuals
who
conspire
with
the
judge,
constitutes
an
invitation
to
corruption.
that's
just
engraved
into
the
idea;
that
if
you
are
going
to
allow
a
man
to
become
immune
from
liability
if
he
can
bribe
a
judge
and
make
him
party
to
the
scheme,
he
automatically
gets
immune
for
his
act.
to
pose
that
question
is
almost
to
answer
it,
i
think.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
right,
well,
of
course,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
is
there,
and
our
protection...
and
the
only
protection
we
have
is,
that
i
think
we
have
been
very
fortunate
in
the
quality
of
lawyers
who
have
taken
the
bench
as
a
career.
there
have
been
exceptions
of
course
and
we
have
been
embarrassed
by
them,
the
profession
has
and
the
judiciary
has--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--it
doesn't
change
his--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--it
doesn't
change
his
character
in
any
way.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well
the
rationale
there
is
substantially
what
mr.
edmonds
said;
that
the
fact
that...
we'll
take,
simplify
it,
we've
got
two
parties;
the
judge
and
one
party,
so
the
one
party
who
bribes
the
judge
finds
out
that
the
judge
is
immune
and
then
you
file
your
conspiracy
suit
on
1983
and
you
cannot
have
a
conspiracy
with
only
one
party.
so
with
the
judge
removed,
they
say,
well,
he
didn't
conspire
with
any
state
official
against
whom
we
could
allege
a
cause
of
action.
well,
of
course,
that's
a
fiction,
he
conspired
with
him,
and
as
in
this
case,
the
injunction
was
issued
as
a
result
of
the
bribe.
it
lasted
for
31
months,
our
client
abated...
he
abated
because
it
had
the
force
of
state
law,
it
was
state
action,
it
had
the
color
of
state
law,
everything
that
was
required
was
there.
and
he
abated
for
31
months.
and
the
trial
that
he
had
was
before
a
judge
that
was
bribed.
now,
that
doesn't
meet
the
standard
that
the
constitution
guarantees.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well,
the
rationale
was
that
because
it
takes
two
to
conspire,
when
you
remove
the
state,
the
immune
state
officer,
you
just
have
one
left;
therefore,
there
was
no
conspiracy
because
you
can't
conspire
with
yourself.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
well,
of
course,
that's
involved
in
it,
too--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
those
matters
are
expressed,
yes
sir.
and
the
opinions
do...
the
opinions
do
sustain
it,
we
point
out,
that
there
were
pretty
frivolous
lawsuits,
but
my
position
is
that
we've
had
those
frivolous
lawsuits
and
we
haven't
had
derivative
immunity
up
until
now.
so
i
think
you
can
allow
a
suit
under
1983
when
it's
meritorious,
and
if
you
follow
the
pleadings
requirements
of
the
seventh
circuit,
you
are
going
to
almost
be
sure
that
it's
meritorious
before
it...
before
you
get
very
far...
certainly
before
you
get
to
the
discovery,
anyway.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
garland
f.
smith
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
of
course,--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--if
he
could...
because
he
did
get
loose.
but
i
think
any
frivolous
lawsuit
certainly
would
be
disposed
of
because
before
they
haul
a
judge
off
his
bench
and
tie
him
up
for
two
weeks
in
testimony,
i
just
can't
see
a
federal
district
judge
allowing
that
to
happen
under
the
rooves
that
allow
protection
against
that
sort
of
harassment.
i
think
to
bring
a
state
judge
off
his
bench,
i
think
the
federal
judge
would
have
to
be
convinced
that
there's
some
merit
to
this
case.
and
of
course--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well
certainly,
certainly.
i
think
any
witness
has
protection
against
harassment.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
think
he
would
have
more,
because
i
think--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--i
think
he
would
have
more
and
i
think
the
courts
would
allow
him
more.
i
think
they
would
recognize
that
the
judge,
because
of
his
responsibilities
to
the
public,
that
they
just
can't
haul
him
off
of
the
bench
and
tie
him
up
for
two
weeks.
i
think
the
courts
would
consider--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well,
that
would...
that
would
be
his
position,
and
his
preference,
i'm
sure.
but
the--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--well,--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--of
course.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
i
think
those
orders
of
protection
could
be
given
in
judicial
cases.
i
think
the
rules
are
more
relaxed
with
respect
to
executive
officers,
those
who
have
what
they
call
a
limited
immunity.
you
see,
a
lot
of
these
public
officers
have
only
limited
immunity.
but
the
courts
still
protect
them.
they
don't
allow
them
to
just
be
taken
away
from
their
jobs.
they
can
make
them
take
a
deposition
by
written
interrogatories
or--
mr.
garland
f.
smith
--it's
when
he
gets
on
the
bench
and
responds.
of
course,
we
don't
know
where
this
bribe
was
given,
whether
it
was
out
on
the
ranch
or
in
town,
in
the
cafe,
in
the
coffee
shop,
or
whether
it
was
in
chambers.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
but
what
he
did
was
when
he
got
on
the
bench
and
entered
the
wrongful
injunction
in
response
to
that.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
he
has
authority
to
enter
an
injunction.
i
think
the
appellate
court
drew
that
he
abused
his
discretion
they...
this
particular
injunction
because
it
wasn't
pled
for,
number
one,
and
they
could
have
him...
the
suit
asked
for
an
injunction
against
pollution.
they
alleged
that
they
were
operating
the
wells
in
a
manner
to
pollute
the
surface
of
the
land,
but
the
surface
of
the
land
in
this
case
wasn't
owned
by
the
petitioner.
but,
the
injunction
could
have
enjoined
pollution,
but
under
texas
law
there
is
no
way
they
could
have
enjoined
him
from
the
lawful
operation
of
producing
oil.
they
could
have
enjoined
him
from
pollution
but
not
from
operating
the
property,
and
that's
where
it
was
fatally
defective
and
that's
why
the
appellate
courts
ruled
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
that
he
entered
it
and
of
course
he
entered
it
without
taking
any
evidence
to
speak
of,
it
was
practically
on
the
pleadings.
but
those
were
in
the
case,
that's
really
not
too
much
involved
here,
but
that's
what
the
background
is.
but
anyway,
in
the
extension
of
immunity
to
private
parties
is
simply
not
necessary
to
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
as
i
see
it.
and
that's
what
the
courts
have
observed
that
have
taken
our
position
in
the
case.
now,
the
courts
that
have
taken
an
opposite
position
has,
it's
been
notice,
talked
about
these
frivolous
lawsuits.
now,
we
don't
deny
that
frivolous
lawsuits
are
going
to
be
filed.
they're
going
to
be
filed
whether
or
not
you
allow
a
suit
from,
you
have
a
meritorious
lawsuit.
but
we
think
the
meritorious
should
be
allowed
certainly.
if
you're
going
to
hear
all
these
frivolous
cases.
now,
and
as
observed
by
the
5th
circuit,
there's
very
little
inconvenience
to
the
judge
and
it's
relatively
insignificant
when
you
compare
it
with
the
benefits
to
be
derived
by
allowing
suits
under
general
immunity.
now,
with
respect
to
a
state
court
case,
there
is
a
case
pending.
i
think
i
should
explain
that
since
it
has
been
mentioned.
when
this
case
was
filed,
judge
carrillo
was
still
sitting
as
judge
of
the
court
in
bigelow
county.
as
it
was
proceeding,
we
realized
we
had
a
more
serious
question
here
on
this
matter
of
judicial
immunity
that
we
thought
when
we
started
out.
frankly,
my
mind
at
the
beginning
just
couldn't
conceive
of
a
holding
that
a
judge
could
accept
a
bribe
and
he
not
be
immune,
and
certainly
that
he
would
confer
that
immunity
to
other
parties.
i
didn't
grasp
that.
mr.
garland
f.
smith
but
that's
substantially
our
case.
that
case
in
the
state
court
was
mainly
protective.
