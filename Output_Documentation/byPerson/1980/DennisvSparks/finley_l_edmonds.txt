mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
points
that
petitioner
feels
are
presented
to
the
court
on
this
petition
for
certiorari
have
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
a
state
court
judge
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
jurisdiction
is
a
person
as
that
term
or
word
is
used
in
section
1983.
petitioner
submits
that
the
resolution
of
that
question
depends
in
great
part
upon
the
scope
of
judicial
immunity
as
that
concept
is
applied
by
this
court.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
judicial
immunity,
your
honor,
petitioner
submits,
is
more
than
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
your
honor,
in
examining
the
development
of
judicial
immunity,
it
seems
that
an
argument
can
be
made
that
it's
in
the
rationale
behind
judicial
immunity,
the
public
interest
to
be
served
by
judicial
immunity.
that
to
put
it
in
terms
that
is
judicial
immunity
an
affirmative
defense
raises
the
question
what
if
the
judge
who
sued
doesn't
raise
the
offense?
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
i'm
saying,
yes,
that
it's
analogous
to
legislative
immunity,
congressional
immunity
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause
if
the
judge,
if
the
purpose
for
questioning
the
judge
or
for
suing
the
judge
is
because
of
his
act
or
conduct
while
a
judge,
acting
within
his
jurisdiction.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
no,
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
it's
a
common
law
of
construction;
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
the
scope
of
judicial
immunity,
just
going
back
to
bradley
v.
fisher
and
throw
out
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
this
court:
pierson,
embler,
more
recently
in
the
consumer
union
case.
the
analysis
of
legislative
immunity,
the
analysis
of
judicial
immunity,
that
if
the
public
interest
or
rationale
behind
this
immunity
is
to
free
the
judge
from
the
intimidation,
harassment,
et
cetera,
as
the
court
has
many
times
discussed
in
these
cases.
if
that
is
the
rationale,
then
rhetorically
does
not
the
rationale
require
that
judicial
immunity
apply
regardless
of
whether
the
judge
raises
it
as
a
defense?
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
judge
rehnquist,
i
would
say
that
it's
more
than
an
affirmative
defense,
as
would
be
a
qualified
immunity
whereon
a
state
officer
or
a
federal
officer
is
asserting
that
he
is
immune
because
of
his
good
faith
carrying
out
of
discretionary
functions.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
or
he
answers...
yes.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
petitioner's
position
is
that
judicial
immunity,
that
the
public
interest
behind
judicial
immunity
is
that
it's
not
in
the
judge's
discretion
to
raise
the
question
of
judicial
immunity.
it's
the
adjudicating
court's
function
to
apply,
it's
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
your
honor,
my
response
to
that
is
does
that
not
raise
the
question,
or
beg
the
issue,
about
the
underlying
rationale
for
the
immunity?
is
it
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
he
wants
to
respond
or
not,
or
is
it
in
the
public
interest
that
he
not
respond?
because
how
does
that
place
a
judge--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--yes,
your
honor.
because
if
one
judge
agrees
that,
okay,
i
will
participate
in
this
lawsuit,
i
won't
raise
my
affirmative
defense
of
judicial
immunity,
and
i'll
go
in
there
and
we'll
straighten
this
thing
out,
well,
what
about
all
the
other
judges?
what
about
the
public
interest
behind
judicial
immunity?
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
what
can
my
client
do
about
it?
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
your
honor,
they
know
he
was
a
judge.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
if
he
came
to
me
and
was
sued
for
conduct
while
not
carrying
out
his
judicial
function,
i
would
agree.
but
in
case
he's
being
sued
because
of
carrying
out
his
judicial
function,
we
know
he's
a
judge.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
why
am
i
suing
him?
for
carrying
out
his
judicial
function
or
for--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--i
would
say
that
the
public
interest
requires
that
the
reviewing
court
apply
judicial
immunity
and
say
that
this
judge
is
immune
because
he
was
acting
as
a
judge
when
he
did
what
he
is
alleged
to
have
done.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
that's
right,
your
honor.
he's
not
a
judge.
and
how
can
my
client
raise
the--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--right.
my
client's
position
is
that
like
the
barra
v.
jackson
case
that
involved
the
defendant
who
had
sold
property
in
violation
of
a
restrictive
covenant
to
folks
of
another
race,
the
question
was,
could
that
defendant
raise
the
constitutionality
of
that
restrictive
covenant
as
it
had
applied
to
the
other
race,
assuming
the
defendant
sold?
and
this
court
held,
yes.
in
griswold
v.
connecticut,
there
the
physician
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
an
accessory
and
an
accomplice
to
third
parties
having
to
do
with
the
state's
ban
on
contraceptives.
and
this
court
held
that
the
physician
had
standing
to
raise
the
constitutionality
argument
that
was
more
directly
applicable
to
the
third
party...
he's
the
person
for
whom
the
physician
had
treated.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
no,
no.
i
mention
those
because
i
think
they're
applicable.
i
was
thinking,
i
guess,
of
the
question
raised
by
the
amicus,
one
of
the
amicus
in
the
case,
questioning
our
ability
to
raise
the
judge's
immunity
because
we're
not
a
judge.
we
were
sued
by
the
plaintiffs
for
participating
in
a
state
judicial
function
and...
well,
our
first
point
about
the
definition
of
person,
the
scope
of
judicial
immunity,
this
to
me
logically
turns
in,
goes
into
the
question
about
was
it
congressional
intent
back
in
1866
and
again
in
1871
and
with
subsequent
amendments
to
the
various
civil
rights
acts,
specifically
this
act,
1983.
is
it
congressional
intent
to
superimpose
federal
court
oversight
or
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
the
litigation
among
parties
of
private
rights
in
the
state
court
authorities?
here
we
don't
have
a
case
of
mr.
dennis
and
the
other
parties
mugging
the
respondent
on
a
highway.
what
we've
got
here
is,
the
other
parties
are
not
before
the
court
right
now
having
gone
to
state
court,
having
filed
a
suit
in
state
court,
a
temporary
injunction
having
been
entered
by
judge
carrillo,
and
that
temporary
injunction
being
dissolved
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
in
the
state
proceedings
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
my
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
i
tend
to
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
i
am
very
reluctant
to
get
into
the
area
of
using
the
terms
of
immunity,
i
suppose.
i
can't
say
that
mr.
dennis
had
an
immunity
at
common
law.
i
can't
say
that
he
had
any
of
the
immunities
that
this
court
has
held
were
not
abrogated
by
congress
when
they
passed
the
civil
rights
statute
we're
dealing
with.
however,
i
am
saying
that
the
public
interest,
the
rationale,
the
logic
behind
judicial
immunity
requires
this
result.
and
if
we
want
to
call
it
"vicarious"
or
"pendent"
or
"derivative",
so
be
it.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
the
rationale
requires
it,
as
pointed
out
by
the
dissent
in
the
en
banc
decision
before
the
5th
circuit.
and
it's
pointed
out
by
others.
it
requires
it
because--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--the
judge
is
home
free,
but
to
allow...
he's
home
free,
from
a
liability
standpoint,
but
i
guess
the
answer
has
to
be
almost
rhetorical.
to
allow
prosecution
of
a
claim
against
a
private
citizen
conspirator
under...
how
is
the
private
citizen
even
liable
under
1983?
it's
because
of
conspiracy
with
a
judge
under
the
adickes
v.
kress.
so
we've
got
to
have
a
conspiracy
with
the
judge.
so
the
judge
is
involved,
the
judge's
interest
is
involved
because
of
the
litigation
against
a
private
person.
the
case
is
necessarily
going
to
involve
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
with
this
judge,
even
though
he's
immune,
even
though
he
can't
be
made
to
participate,
even
though
he
can't
be
made
to
testify.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
there
is
no
case
that
holds
that,
your
honor.
it's
petitioner's
construction
that
the
concept
of
judicial
immunity
requires
that
the
judge
not
participate,
just
as
this
court
recently
held--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--that's
quite
true,
your
honor,
but
this
is
a
civil
case.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
but
not
for
this,
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
to
my
knowledge
he
has
not
been
prosecuted
in
a
state
district
court
for
misconduct.
he
was
removed
from
his
office
because
of
conduct
including
misconduct.
again--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
if
we
say--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--well,
if
we
say
that
public
interest
requires
that
judges
not
be
subjected
to
a
pleading
contest
that
can
be
brought
about
by
any
dissatisfied
litigant
in
any
state
court
action,
that...
to
say
that,
okay,
immunity
means
that
you
can't...
that
he's
entitled
to
dismissal
as
a
party
and
immunity
means
that
you
can't
get--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--again,
that
was
a
criminal
action
though,
was
it
not,
your
honor?
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
petitioner
is
arguing
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
scope
of
judicial
immunity
in
a
civil
action,
and
the
scope
in
a
criminal
action.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
i
think
there
are
other
state
or
public
interests
that
are
floating
in
that
scheme
of
things;
the
rationale
behind
the
protections
of
the
system
of
prosecutors
and
grand
juries
and
indictments
and
the
state
itself,
but
when
you
get
to
the
civil
action
area
under
section
1983,
you're
talking
about
enforcement,
about
albeit
harassment
of
judges
by
private
persons,
the
same
constitutional
or
statutory
safeguards
don't
apply.
but
i
do
agree
there
is
a
conflict
there
that
i
think
is
resolved
by
differing
public
policy
interests.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
there
would
be
judicial
immunity,
with
respect
to
a
civil
action,
for
the
bribery.
with
respect
to
a
criminal
prosecution
for
the
bribery,
there
would
not
be.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
there
is
a
damage
remedy,
and
that
remedy
is
being
pursued
by
the
respondent
in
the
form
of
a
wrongful
injunction
suit.
under
texas
law,
the
dissolution
of
an
injunction
creates
the
cause
of
action
for
the
wrongful
injunction.
but
in
that
case,
the
motives
of
the
judge,
in
entering
the
injunction,
is
not
a
critical
or
a
turning
factor.
but
here,
we're
talking
about
how
do
you
get
to
the
private
under
1983?
you
get
to
him
only
because
of
a
conspiracy
with
the
state
actor;
in
this
case
it's
a
judge.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
no.
no,
only
the...
mr.
manges,
who
was
the
party
that
got
the
injunction,
and
my
client's
liability
would
be
limited
solely
to
the
bond
that
he
signed.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
that
please
the
court.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes,
your
honor,
if
i
may
take
a
few
minutes
to
respond
to
several
matters
that
have
been
raised.
mr.
smith
makes
the
statement
in
his
argument
that
his
client
is
left
out
in
the
cold.
again,
i
think
this
consideration
is
critical
when
we
talk
about
the
rationale
for
this
statute,
the
rationale
of
congress
in
implementing
this
and
passing
this
statute
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment.
judge
carrillo
did
enter
this
injunction
but
that
injunction
in
the
course
of
the
procedures
and
the
substantive
law
that
exists
in
the
state
of
texas,
that
injunction
was
set
aside
by
a
texas
court.
sparks
and
lynd,
mr.
smith's
clients,
did
not
have
to
go
to
a
federal
court
to
get
the
texas
courts
to
do
right.
the
texas
courts
resolved
the
question.
he
was
not
left
out
in
the
cold.
secondly,
they
were
not
left
out
in
the
cold
because
they
have
pending
a
lawsuit
in
a
texas
court
under
texas
law
for
the
wrongful
injunction.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
part
of
that
lawsuit
is
pending
in
nueces
county,
your
honor,
as
was
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
part
of
that
lawsuit
under
the
texas
venue
procedure,
the
lawsuit
as
it
applies
to
my
client,
mr.
dennis,
is
pending
in
nueces
county.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes,
your
honor,
which
i
submit
is
not
a
hornet's
nest
in
texas.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
or
briar
patch.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
if
one
of
the
four
was
a
state
judge?
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
that's--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
the
public
interest
behind
judicial
immunity
would
definitely
not
be
satisfied.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
your
statement,
that
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
we're
going
to
prove
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
for
this
judge
to
do
wrong.
that's
the
very
essence
of
judicial
immunity,
the
very
essence
of
it.
and
my
man
is
raising
that
immunity,
not
because
he's
a
judge
but
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
pierson
v.
ray
that
judicial
immunity
is
applicable
in
1983
despite
the
fact
that
there's
nothing
said
in
that
statute
about
judicial
immunity
or
any
immunity.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
to
use
mr.
smith's
term,
i
guess
that
would
be
a
fiction
that
we'd
be
dealing
with,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
purpose
of
immunity
is
to
create
a
fiction.
i
think
the
purpose
of
this
immunity
that
goes
back
to
the
king's
bench,
hundreds
of
years
ago,
is
that
there
was
presumption
that
it
does
exist.
and
if
we
wanted
to
find
that
what
if
we
get
into
a
situation
where
the
majority
of
judges
are
corrupt?
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
perhaps
public
interest
will
be
changed
then.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
just
the
mere
fact
of
filing,
the
ability
to
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
i
have
to
submit
to
the
court
that
this
isn't
as
easy
a
question
to
answer
as
mr.
smith's
events.
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
there's
a
black
and
white
side
to
this.
it's
a
matter
of
balancing.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
no,
but
he's
immune
if
the
conduct
for
which
he
was
sued
falls
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
if
we're
not
talking
here
about,
should
the
scope
of
judicial
immunity
be
broad
enough
to
somehow
screen
out
lawsuits
as
they're
being
filed
as
the
clerk's
house,
i
guess
the
answer
there
is
to
respond
upon,
depend
upon
responsible
journalism
that
they
don't
blow
a
lawsuit
like
that
out
of
proportion
when
it's
filed,
before
it's
adjudicated.
under
the
respondent's
view
of
1983
and
the
ability
to
pursue
conspirators,
these
private
citizens,
i
submit
that,
to
follow
respondent's
view
of
the
case,
that
the
respondent
could
have
gone
to
federal
court
immediately
at
the
time
that
judge
carrillo
entered
the
temporary
injunction
even
before
the
beaumont
court
of
appeals
in
texas
had
a
chance
to
throw
it
out.
mr.
smith
is
fortunate
in
that
he
can
present
to
the
court
such
a
bad
set
of
facts.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
under
1983
if
we
have
a
conspiracy
and
if
the
immunity
of
that
judge
does
not
in
effect
shield
the
judicial
proceeding--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--no.
i'm
saying
that
he
could
sue
for
damages.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
your
honor,
that
is
bribery.
that's
mr.
smith's
term.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
well,
maybe
i
didn't
state
myself
clearly.
what
i
was
stating,
that
under
the
respondent's
view
of
the
case,
that
that
just
after
the
trial
court
stage
that
he
would
be
would
entitled
under
section
1983
to
file
a
suit
for
damages
in
federal
court,
despite
what
might
happen
in
state
court.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
if
it's
a
suit
under
a...
a
civil
action
suit--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--and
if
it's
based
upon
the
judge's
conduct
as
a
judge.
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
the
reason--
mr.
finley
l.
edmonds
--yes,
your
honor.
as
far
as
the
fiction
concerning
whether
a
judge,
given
this
court's
decisions,
that
judicial
immunity
is
applicable
in
1983
cases,
to
say
that,
trying
to
say
that
a
judge
is
or
isn't
a
person
is
fiction,
that...
one
could
almost
say
that
judicial
immunity
itself
is
a
fiction
when
it
comes
to
applying
that
to
1983.
i
will
submit
that
it
was
not
the
congress's
intent
to
litigate
in
federal
court
all
states'
courts'
civil
proceedings.
