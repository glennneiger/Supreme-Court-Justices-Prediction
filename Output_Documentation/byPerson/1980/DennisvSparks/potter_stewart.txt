justice
stewart
that's
a
matter
of...
those
cases
really
turn
on
standing--
justice
stewart
--and
as
one
person
has
the
interest
through
the
rights
of
jus
tertii,
the
rights
of
a
third
person.
is
that
what
this
is,
a
standing
case,
kind
of?
not
exactly.
justice
stewart
well
that
argument
would
remind
that
concept
of
judicial
immunity.
justice
stewart
well
your
lawsuit,
you
say,
is
not
frivolous
and
i
assume
that
it
isn't--
justice
stewart
--but
this
rule
of
law
through
which
you
contend,
will
it
allow
frivolous
lawsuits?
justice
stewart
well
one
way
is
to
decide
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
and
just
so
long
as
he
includes
a
private
citizen
as
a
coconspirator,
he
can
sue
the
private
citizen--
justice
stewart
--and
no
matter
how
frivolous,
any
plaintiff
can
do
it.
justice
stewart
well,
what
are
these
rules
set
up
by
the
seventh
circuit?
how
do
you
get--
justice
stewart
--how
do
you
stop
somebody
from
filing
a
complaint?
justice
stewart
no.
justice
stewart
by
dealing
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
stewart
and
that's
exactly
what
judicial
immunity
is
supposed
to
prevent
at
the
outset,
nip
in
the
bud;
you
don't
get
to
the
merits
of
the
case
because
the
defendant
is
immune,
cannot
be
sued.
justice
stewart
well
the
problem
is
still
there,
i
suggest.
justice
stewart
but
a
malicious
person
can
plead
with
particularity.
absolutely
so.
justice
stewart
well
that's
the...
that's
what
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
itself
does.
justice
stewart
yes.
but
your
argument
would
undermine
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
itself.
justice
stewart
but
the
rule
for
which
you
contend
could
not
be
confined
to
duval
county,
texas
and
would
enable
any
person
convicted,
for
example,
of
a
criminal
offense
to
bring
a
1983
lawsuit
against
the
complaining
witness
in
his
case
and
on
the
claim
that
the
complaining
witness
conspired
with
the
judge
to
do
him
dirt.
justice
stewart
well,
where
you
have
judicial
corruption
on
the
part
of
the
judge
alone,
without...
who's
not
in
cahoots
with
anybody...
judicial
immunity
does
provide
a
cover-up,
to
use
your
words.
justice
stewart
or
impeachment,
his
not
being
re-elected.
justice
stewart
of
course,
a
judge
doesn't
have
any
immunity
at
all
for
conduct
that
occurs
outside
of
his
judicial
office.
i
mean
if
a
judge
hits
you
with
his
automobile
on
some
afternoon
he's
not
immune
at
all,
any
more
than
any
other
negligent
driver
is.
justice
stewart
but
the
act--
justice
stewart
yes,
i
know,
but
they
say
that's
a
briar
patch
down
in
duval
county,
that
they
can't
get
justice.
justice
stewart
what's
that?
corpus
christi?
justice
stewart
a
briar
patch
is
their
place.
