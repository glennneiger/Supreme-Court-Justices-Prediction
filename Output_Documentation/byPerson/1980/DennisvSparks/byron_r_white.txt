justice
white
or
he
answers
and
litigates
the
case
without
ever
raising
the
claim
that
judgment
is
against
him.
is
that
judgment
good?
justice
white
who
said
he
couldn't
testify?
why
can't
he
be
made
to
testify
or
is
that
what
you
said?
where...
what
case
holds
that?
justice
white
well,
what
about...
no,
no,
a
judge
isn't
immune
from
criminal
indictment
on
grounds
of
official
immunity.
justice
white
you're
suggesting
this
judge
couldn't
be
called
as
a
witness
against
his
coconspirators?
justice
white
he
might
not
even...
all
right,
go
ahead.
justice
white
well
then,
immunity
for
these
people
isn't
required,
then,
to
implement
any
of
the
policies
of
giving
judges
immunity.
they
can't
be
bothered
for
anything.
if
they
can't
be
called
as
witnesses,
then
why
do
you
need
to
give
their
coconspirators
immunity
just
to
protect
the
judge,
if
the
judge
is
already
protected
by...
from
being
called
as
a
witness
or
dragged
through
cases?
i
thought
your
argument
would
be
that
if
you
didn't
give
these
people
immunity
the
judge
could
be
called
as
a
witness,
and
would
be
involved
in
this
case...
if
you
take
him
away
from
his
judicial
duties
and
have
his
motives
questioned?
i
thought
so
too.
it
brought
to
my
mind
the
controversy
between
jefferson
and
burr,
when...
and
when
john
marshall
was
sitting
in
the
treason
trial
and
tried
to
get
jefferson
to
appear
as
a
witness.
and
i
think
they
settled
it
by
jefferson
simply
furnishing
papers,
and
jefferson's
response
was
if
the
president
could
be
subpoenaed
from
one
court
to
another,
he
can
be
prevented
from
doing
his
presidential
business.
but
if
you
say
he
can't...
that
the
judge
can't
even
be
subpoenaed
to
testify,
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
reason
in
the
policy
that
justice
white
has
mentioned,
to
say
that
the
coconspirators
share
his
immunity.
between
the
burr
case
and
one
more
recent
case,
the
courts
have
held
that
even
the
president
must
respond
and
be
a
witness
if
necessary.
justice
white
but
this
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
this
isn't
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
now,
you're
going
to
defend
that,
aren't
you?
justice
white
well,
if
it's
that
clear,
it's
rather
strange
that
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
decided
against
you.
justice
white
well,
what...
the
seventh
has
changed
its
mind?
justice
white
are
you
sure?
is
that
from
that
en
banc--
justice
white
--was
that
the
en
banc
per
curiam,
or
was
that
the--
justice
white
--that's
the
later
one,
all
right.
justice
white
all
right,
what
other
one
has
changed
its
mind?
justice
white
well
that
isn't
a...
that
isn't
a
change
of
mind--
justice
white
--all
right.
justice
white
all
right,
tell
me
another
one
that's
changed
its
mind?
the
fifth
has,
of
course,
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
the
ninth
is
still
against
you.
justice
white
and
the
third
is
still
against
you.
justice
white
the
fourth
is
still
against
you.
justice
white
the
sixth
is
still
against
you.
justice
white
all
right,
well,
it's
about
even
then,
isn't
it?
you
want
to
straighten
them
out,
is
that
it,
counsel?
justice
white
my
only
point
was
that
there's
been
an
awful
lot
of
courts
of
appeals
that
have
felt
that
the
policies
of
judicial
immunity
required
immunity
for
private
parties.
justice
white
--you
haven't
been
watching
the
flow
of
cases
in
appellate
courts,
either.
justice
white
with
lawyers,
and
all
with
lawyers.
justice
white
well,
there
is
no
way
around
that.
by
the
way,
is
there
a
judicial
immunity
under
texas
law?
justice
white
for
damage...
is
it
absolute
immunity,
like,
similar
to
what
has
been
announced
in
1983
suits?
justice
white
but
to
the
extent
there
is,
the
judges
are
immune?
justice
white
well
what
about,
you
haven't
had
any
third-party
cases
then?
justice
white
or
for
judicial
immunity?
justice
white
you
mean
therefore
there
are
some
cases
that
held
that
it
didn't,
or
just
that
there
weren't
any
cases?
justice
white
all
right,
so
that
you
really...
so
that
there
were
cases
that
said
it
didn't
exist?
justice
white
but
official
immunity
doesn't
insulate
a
judge
from
either
criminal
liability
nor
from
disbarment,
or
from
investigation
by...
or
removal?
justice
white
--so
there
is
a
brand
of...
the
judge
would
have
a
degree
of
immunity
from
being
hauled
into
the
case?
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
the
judge
would
have
any
more
than
anybody
else?
justice
white
he
would
have
more?
justice
white
of
course,
your
colleague
suggests
that
he
couldn't
be
called
at
all.
justice
white
well,
what
if
the
plaintiffs
in
a
lawsuit
file
the
lawsuit
against
your
clients
and
they
claim
the
immunity
and
your
clients
come
in
and
claim
immunity,
based
on
the
immunity
of
a
state
judge?
and
the
answer
of
the
plaintiffs
is,
we
stipulate
that
we'll
never
bother
that
judge,
we'll
never
call
him
as
a
witness,
he'll
never
be
a
witness
against
any
of
you,
we'll
not
bother
him
at
all.
but
we'd
have
to
admit
that
in
the
course
of
our
lawsuit
we're
going
to
try
to
prove
that
he
was
corrupt.
now,
would
you
think
your
claim
of
immunity
would
be
satisfied
by,
on
any
stipulation
like
that?
justice
white
why?
why
not?
justice
white
--the
public
interest
rationale
certainly
doesn't
prevent
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
which
may
get
great
publicity
in
the
papers
as
to
what
the
claims
are
about
what
some
judge
did.
and
despite
any
stipulation
or
the
immunity
of
the
judge
from
being
called
as
a
witness,
there
it
is,
and
if
the
case
goes
forward
against
him
and
there's
a
judgment
against
the
plaintiffs...
namely
that
the...
that
nobody
did
anything
wrong,
why,
the
judge
is
going
to
be
vindicated,
i
suppose.
justice
white
and
if
the
finding
is
that
the
conspirators
really
did
conspire
with
the
judge,
it
doesn't
add
a
whole...
so
what's
the--
justice
white
--well...
oh,
i
know,
but
the
immunity
doesn't
protect
their
buddy
from
that.
justice
white
well,
he
would
have
very
big
trouble
doing
that
in
the
face
of
the
anti-injunction
act
and
a
few
other
things.
justice
white
well,
you
aren't
going
to
be,
you
wouldn't
be
enjoining
the
judge
or
the
judicial
proceeding.
justice
white
well,
you
mean
he
could...
well,
all
right.
he
could
probably
enjoin
the
conspirators
from
continuing
to
bribe
the
judge.
