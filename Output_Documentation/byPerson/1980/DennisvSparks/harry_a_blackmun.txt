isn't
there
more
than
that?
isn't
it
the
discouragement
of
frivolous

secondly,
the--

by

mr.
edmonds,
if
you
had
four
conspirators
here,
alleged
conspirators,
rather
than
just
one
and
the
judge,
but
one
of
the
four
was
a
state
judge,
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
blackmun
yes.
justice
blackmun
so
that
his
immunity
applies
to
all
the
other
conspirators,
not
just
a
single
one.

that
your
position?
