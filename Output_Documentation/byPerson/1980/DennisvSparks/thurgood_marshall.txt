justice
marshall
what
could
you
do
about
it?
what
could
you
or
anybody
else
do
about
it?
justice
marshall
what
could
you
or
anybody
else
do
if
a
judgment
was
obtained
against
judge
joe
bloke
who
never
told
anybody
that
he
was
a
judge
and
never
raised
a
question?
now,
what
could
anybody
do
about
it?
nothing.
justice
marshall
but
he
says
that
it's
not
jurisdictional.
justice
marshall
then
it's
not
jurisdictional...
in
fact,
if
you'd
sue
him
as
john
jones
and
he
happens
to
be
a
judge,
what
would
happen?
justice
marshall
for
just
what
he
did
here,
and
you
didn't
mention
that
he
was
a
judge?
justice
marshall
something
like
pendent
immunity.
vicarious
immunity
is--
justice
marshall
that
would
be
enjoining
a
crime.
you
can't
enjoin
a
crime.
justice
marshall
what
you
say
is
that
in
any
court
action
that
has
more
than
one
defendant
and
one
of
the
defendants
is
an
immune
judge,
all
of
the
others
are
equally
immune.
isn't
that
what
you
say?
justice
marshall
if
it's
a
suit,
1983
or
anything
else--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--if
it
has
more
than
person
involved
and
one
of
the
people
is
a
judge,
all
of
the
others...
one,
two,
or
37...
are
all
immune.
justice
marshall
you
notice
i
didn't
ask
you
for
any
support.
