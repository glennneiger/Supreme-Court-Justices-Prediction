justice
stevens
--mr.
edmonds,
would
there
be
a
state
law
civil
remedy
against
your
clients
for
the
alleged
bribery
attempts?
justice
stevens
and
no
immunity
claim
would
defeat
that
action?
you're
asking
the
federal
court
to
grant
a
broader
immunity
than
the
state
courts
of
texas
grant,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
asking
about
a
damage
remedy
brought
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
against
the
non-judicial
defendants
in
this
case,
making
the
same
allegations
that
are
made
here.
justice
stevens
so
that
apart
from
that
action
on
the
bond,
is
there
a
tort
action
in
texas
available...
in
a
matter
of
common
law
for
bribing
a
judge...
to
harm
you
in
some
way?
justice
stevens
it's
not
even
that,
is
it,
mr.
smith?
even
if
it's
a
frivolous
lawsuit,
if
the
judge
isn't
a
defendant
he
can
get
out...
i
mean,
he
doesn't
have
much
of
a
burden
on
him,
the
fact
that
somebody
alleged
to
have
bribed
him
is
being
sued,--
justice
stevens
what
protection,
mr.
smith?
you
say
it
would
be
available
even
if
it
was
an
accident
case
and
the
judge
was
a
witness,
you
say
the
federal
judge
isn't
going
to
drag
him
off
the
bench
and
inconvenience
him
unnecessarily.
that's
all
you're
saying
there,
isn't
it?
