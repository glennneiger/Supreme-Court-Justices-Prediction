justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lassoff,
might
i
interrupt
your
preliminary
--
preliminary
there.
i
noticed
that
there
are
these
--
there
are
three
cases
consolidated
here
and
that
in
the
rodriguez
case
as
opposed
to
the
other
two,
there
was
a
--
an
order
filed
and
in
the
other
two
there
were
none.
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
outcome
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
before
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
this
political
compromise
that
you
referred
that
took
place
in
1972
had
the
full
participation
of
the
longshoreman
workers
union,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
--
the
stevedoring
companies
assets
are
intended
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
longshoreman?
i
would
have
thought
if
it
were
a
corporation,
its
assets
were
probably
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
stockholders.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
who
has
six
months
in
which
to
assert
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
say
to
--
to
the
--
any
statute
of
limitations
argument
in
a
situation
like
this?
these
are
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
must
come
a
period
of
repose
where
past
things
that
have
not
been
litigated
can
no
longer
be
litigated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
the
same
type
of
principle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stearns,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
lassoff
that
the
rodriguez
case
is
precisely
on
the
same
footing
as
the
other
two
for
purposes
of
our
decision
here?
