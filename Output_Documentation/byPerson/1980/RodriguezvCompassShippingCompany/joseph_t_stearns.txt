mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
stearns.
i
represent
the
first
two
respondents
being
compass
shipping
company,
djakarta
lloyd
and
arya
national
shipping
line
in
this
case
which
involves
the
question
of
section
33
and
also
section
5
(b)
of
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
there's
been
a
brief
reference
to
some
part
of
the
history
of
the
act.
as
i
understand
it,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
adopted
in
1927
in
response
to
a
decision
of
this
court
making
the
longshore
and
jones
act
seamen.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
section
33.
it
provided
that
longshoreman
have
an
election
that
we
have
a
compensation
or
a
suit
for
damages.
in
response
apparently
to
the
concern
for
the
possibility
that
someone
would
unwittingly
lose
his
right
to
a
third
--
third
party
damage
suit,
congress
in
1938
amended
section
33
to
expand
the
rights
in
a
way
which
this
court
in
1947
in
the
american
stevedore
against
porello
case
held
to
extend
a
longshoreman
the
dual
right
to
accept
voluntary
compensation
and
thereafter
a
sue
for
damages.
after
ryan
and
perhaps
before
that,
perhaps
in
the
contribution
cases,
the
existence
of
the
right
to
accept
a
--
a
voluntary
compensation
and
sue
for
damages
created
a
conflict
of
interest.
unquestionably,
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
which
was
raised
by
the
ryan
indemnity
right
which
in
instances
where
there
was
common
insurance
between
a
defendant
and
a
third
party
defendant
as
in
the
czaplicki
case.
it
was
held
by
this
court
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
give
effect
to
the
section
33
(b)
assignment.
in
response
to
that,
congress
in
1959,
in
attempt
to
overcome
the
conflict
of
interest,
gave
longshoreman
an
additional
six
months
to
sue
following
receipt
of
compensation
pursuant
to
an
award.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
efforts
on
behalf
of
longshoreman,
that
in
part
demonstrated
by
the
porello
case,
the
extension
of
the
dual
remedy
of
compensation
and
a
right
to
sue
for
damages
as
a
result
of
this
court's
ryan
decision,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
sieracki
decision.
the
situation
existed
--
a
situation
existed
whereby
longshoremen
were
of
course,
by
statute
guaranteed
--
guaranteed
compensation
and
in
effect
have
guarantee
--
guaranteed
--
excuse
me
--
a
--
virtually
a
certain
right
to
recover
damages
as
--
as
a
result
of
these
facts.
and
as
a
result
directly
of
this
court's
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
longshoreman,
there
followed
an
explosion
of
litigation
in
the
years
according
to
the
congressional
documents
between
1961
and
1972
to
the
point
where
in
courts
such
as
new
york,
virtually
every
longshoreman's
reported
accident
resulted
in
a
third
party
suit.
by
virtue
of
sieracki,
it
was
virtually
necessary
only
for
the
longshoreman
to
show
that
he
was
hurt
aboard
the
ship
as
a
result
of
a
contest
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
as
to
who
should
pay
the
damages.
the
ultimate
recovery
of
the
plaintiff
was
further
guaranteed.
congress
in
1972
was
there
--
therefore
consul
--
confronted
with
a
situation
where
this
court's
efforts
had
resulted
in
a
situation
where
a
longshoreman
had
a
free
access
to
suit
and
a
free
access
to
recovery
in
the
third
party
cases
where
as
a
result
of
those
facts,
there
had
been
a
tremendous
increase
in
litigation
and
took
steps
by
enacting
the
1972
amendments
in
order
to
reduce
the
volume
of
litigation
in
exchange
for
vastly
increased
compensation
benefits.
as
mr.
lassoff
has
indicated,
congress
in
1972
took
away
from
longshoreman
certain
things
and
this
represents
the
first
instance
since
1927
where
either
by
this
court
or
any
other
court
or
by
congress,
something
was
taken
away.
what
was
taken
away
was
two
things,
we
submit.
the
first
one
obviously
being
the
right
to
recover
for
seaworthiness
and
the
second
thing
we
believe
is
that
there
was
an
additional
restriction
placed
on
the
third
party
right
in
order
to
serve
the
first
purpose
of
the
1972
amendments
which
was
to
reduce
litigation
and
relieve
shipowners
and
the
courts
from
the
enormous
burden
of
case
after
case
after
case
of
personal
injuries
involving
a
longshoreman,
some
of
which
were
of
the
kind
or
the
type
or
the
apparent
lack
of
seriousness
of
the
cases
involved
in
this
appeal.
the
additional
step
taken
by
congress,
we
submit,
was
to
make
the
right
of
the
longshoreman
to
sue
depend
upon
that
suit
being
in
accordance
with
section
33
which
we
read
as
indicating
that
suit
can
be
maintained
only
if
authorized
by
the
six
months
provision
in
section
33
(b)
which
means,
we
submit,
that
no
suit
brought
by
a
longshoreman
after
six
months
can
be
maintained
since
the
six
months
provision
is
a
constituent
element
of
his
course
of
action.
in
the
congressional
documents,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
port
of
philadelphia
that
the
compensation
insurance
rate
for
these
accidents,
including
the
cost
of
compensation
and
the
stevedore's
third
party,
ryan
indemnity
liability
was
approximately
$40
a
payroll
hundred.
according
to
the
new
york
state
rating
board,
in
new
york
today,
for
workmen's
compensation
alone,
in
the
category
stevedoring,
not
otherwise
classified,
the
manual
rate
for
stevedores
is
$87
and
change
the
payroll
hundred.
that
is
to
say
that
the
cost
of
the
stevedores
both
for
compensation
and
third
party
ryan
indemnity
liability
in
1972
was
approximately
half
of
what
it
is
today.
and
these
figures
are
not
figures
that
are
the
product
of
inflation.
it's
$40
per
hundred
and
$87
per
hundred
and
it
represents
a
doubling
of
costs
in
real
terms
as
a
direct
result
of
the
vast
increase
in
benefits
achieved
by
the
1972
amendments.
it
means
in
effect
that
the
maritime
industry
and
since
the
stevedore
has
one
customer,
the
shipowner,
since
the
stevedore
is
in
effect
an
agency
of
the
shipowner
but
the
shipowner
pays
this
costs
directly,
usually
as
soon
as
the
ship
sails.
it
means
the
cost
of
these
claims
before
the
first
complaint
is
filed
has
doubled.
it
also
means
that
if
there
is
not
relief
from
litigation,
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
achieve
a
reduction
of
litigation
will
not
be
achieved
and
that
in
effect,
there
will
be
no
so-called
quid
pro
quo
extended
to
the
maritime
industry
in
exchange
for
a
benefit
structure
which
is
of
unprecedented
generosity.
it
is
vital
to
the
interest
of
the
maritime
community
that
there'd
be
in
one
appropriate
form
or
other
curb
on
litigation
involving
cases
like
these,
involving
contused
aversions,
aberrations
and
fractured
bones,
resulting
in
six
and
seven
weeks
of
alleged
period
of
disability
where
compensation
benefits
of
three,
four,
five,
six
and
seven
thousand
are
routinely
paid
based
on
the
earnings
and
benefit
structure
existing
in
1973
which
have
been
vastly
increased.
it
is
essential
to
the
vitality
of
the
maritime
industry
that
cases
of
this
kind
--
i
mean,
the
cases
of
this
kind
where
--
where
and
whenever
appropriate
to
be
handled
as
compensation
matters.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
bloomer,
a
longshoreman
who
receives
for
example
$5,000
in
workmen's
compensation,
benefits
as
a
result
of
his
third
party
suit
only
when
his
verdict
exceeds
$7500.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
norfolk
and
western
against
the
liepelt
case,
the
compensation
liability
or
rather
the
tax
liability
of
an
injured
employee
must
be
reduced
in
calculating
his
lost
wages
and
lost
future
wages
as
a
typical
matter.
in
longshoreman's
personal
injury
cases,
the
total
course
of
action
that
is
presented
in
the
guise
of
a
longshoreman
suit
against
the
stevedore
is
the
claim
of
the
stevedore
to
recover
its
so-called
lien.
in
one
case
after
another
--
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
that
the
entire
course
of
action
which
is
presented
to
a
jury
as
a
claim
by
a
longshoreman
against
a
shipowner.
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
i'm
sorry.
is
--
is
in
effect
that
case,
in
that
form
is
in
effect
a
claim
by
the
stevedore
to
recover
its
compensation
expenses,
is
a
case
in
new
york,
a
case
in
which
judge
meskill
--
judge
friendly
dissented,
cannizzo
against
farrell
lines
report
in
a
579
f.
2d
which
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
point
i'm
attempting
to
make.
the
case
involved
a
man
in
his
50s
who
had
sustained
a
knee
injury
and
as
a
result
of
the
knee
injury,
he
had
surgery.
he
had
a
heart
condition
and
he
was
found
to
be
by
a
district
court
judge
permanently
disabled.
there
was
a
dispute
about
a
reduction
in
the
award
to
him
after
the
bench
trial
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
he
was
just
industrially
disabled
or
whether
in
fact
he
was
totally
disabled.
in
any
event,
there
was
a
calculation
of
damages
with
this
reduction
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
be
inappropriate
of
damages
in
range
of
$110,000
and
the
case
after
a
clear
clash
between
judge
friendly
and
judge
meskill
with
respect
to
when
and
what
circumstances
a
--
a
shipowner
should
be
liable
to
a
longshoreman.
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
retrial
on
damages.
the
case
was
settled.
it
was
settled
a
little
bit
less
than
seven
years
after
the
injury
at
which
point
the
lien
was
$63,900.
it
was
settled
for
$90,000
so-called
fresh
money
in
addition
to
the
lien.
the
stevedore
waived
its
lien
and
$90,000
was
advanced
by
the
shipowner
to
be
disposed
of
and
settle
the
case.
next,
the
gross
settlement
of
$153,000.
from
that
$153,000
as
a
result
of
bloomer,
the
attorney
for
plaintiff
takes
according
to
what
we
assume
to
be
or
what
i
assume
to
be
a
third
contingency
retainer
fee,
the
sum
of
$51,000
for
a
trial
and
a
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
assume
that
$2000
was
consumed
in
litigating
--
litigation
expenses
i
think
is
reasonable,
reducing
the
recovery
to
a
$100,000
from
which
of
course
must
come
the
$63,900
lien
in
round
figures,
the
recovery
by
the
plaintiff
is
$36,000.
but
--
but
of
course
that's
not
his
recovery
because
he's
entitled
under
section
33
(f)
and
(g)
to
so-called
deficiency
compensation
and
he
goes
back
on
compensation
when
the
net
to
him
is
exhausted.
if
he
was
receiving
workmen's
compensation
at
the
rate
of
$9,000
a
year,
the
net
of
$36,000
would
mean
that
the
stevedore's
compensation
exposure
would
be
that
--
would
suspended
for
a
period
of
four
years.
it
means
that
the
benefit
of
the
third
party
suit
where
a
lawyer
got
a
fee
of
$51,000,
his
interest
on
$36,000
figured
under
the
declining
balance
at
$9000
a
year
at
bank
interest
rates,
the
figure
which
might
be
a
range
of
$2500
or
$3000.
that
interest
is
a
double
recovery
because
he's
entitled
to
his
damages
or
his
compensation
whichever
is
larger.
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
judge
--
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
judge,
it's
not
a
--
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
show
is
this.
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
no
sir,
he's
not.
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
--
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
what
i'm
trying
to
do
for
background
is
to
--
is
to
--
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
well
it
--
it
can't
now,
no,
it's
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
it
was
not,
that's
great.
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
well
it's
good
for
an
illustration
of
what
the
value
of
the
third
party
case,
the
longshoreman
is.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
--
as
we've
said
constitutive
element
of
suit
within
six
months
and
since
that
may
involve
policy
decisions
as
to
what
--
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
no.
that's
true.
what
i
was
trying
to
--
to
illustrate
is
at
some
point
about
the
value
of
the
third
party
case
to
longshoreman
and
to
suggest
that
the
accordance
with
provision
of
section
5
be
interpreted
literally
and
(b)
a
basis
for
bar
of
longshoreman
suit,
six
months,
after
six
months
from
the
time
that
they
receive
their
award
and
there's
an
additional
point
made
with
respect
to
the
safety
of
longshoreman
which
is
not
by
any
means
certainly
guaranteed
or
even
advanced
by
the
bringing
of
longshoreman
personal
injury
cases.
it
is
basically
our
position
that
this
matter
of
six
months
to
sue
is
not
a
matter
of
rule
17,
it's
a
matter
of
section
33
and
section
5
(b).
it's
a
time
bar.
it
prevents
absolutely
the
bringing
of
a
suit
by
longshoreman
unless
there
is
compliance
with
the
statute
which
authorizes
his
suit.
mr.
joseph
t.
stearns
judge,
it's
--
it's
the
perez
case
where
a
formal
order
is
involved
and
there
were
four
questions
posed
in
the
application
for
a
writ.
one
of
them
had
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
sufficient
procedural
step
taking
by
the
office
of
workmens'
compensation
programs
in
order
to
trigger
the
section
33
assignment.
now,
that
was
not
that
question,
the
procedural
sufficiency
question
was
not
the
subject
of
the
writ.
so,
it's
irrelevant
i
think
for
--
for
this
case.
thank
you.
