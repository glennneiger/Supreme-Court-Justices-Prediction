mr.
francis
x.
byrn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
twenty
five
years
ago,
i
was
admitted
to
the
bar
of
this
court
to
work
on
the
brief
in
the
czaplicki
case
and
i
find
it
rather
fascinating
that
i
have
returned
here
now
25
years
later
to
talk
to
the
court
about
the
interpretation
of
czaplicki
which
makes
me
i
think
the
historian
on
this
particular
argument.
and
if
we
could
return
for
the
moment
to
1956
when
the
congress
decided
to
respond
to
the
ryan
decision
and
they
did
so
very
expeditiously
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
early
1956.
there
were
extensive
hearings
held,
the
conflict
of
interest
argument
was
explored
fully.
the
czaplicki
case
was
discussed.
and
at
that
time
while
the
hearings
were
going
on,
it
was
between
the
argument
and
the
decision
in
the
czaplicki
case
and
the
attorneys
for
mr.
czaplicki
testified
in
1956
and
they
testified
rather
optimistically
about
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
byrn
that's
correct,
in
1956,
in
may
and
june.
and
in
june,
this
court
decided
czaplicki
and
as
i
said
they
were
optimistic
about
the
result
and
it
was
warranted
from
their
point
of
view.
the
court
or
the
congress
then
responded
and
began
drafting
this
six-month
provision
rule
from
the
time
of
the
award.
now,
we've
talked
about
six
months
here
but
frequently
as
in
these
cases
before
us,
the
time
runs
anywhere
from
a
year
and
a
half
to
two
years
that
the
man
himself
has
the
right
to
sue.
he
has
the
full
opportunity
to
bring
suit
anytime
during
that
period
and
that's
the
thrust
of
the
rodriguez
case.
now
in
those
hearings,
there
was
a
comment
by
i
think
the
representative
of
the
association
of
the
bar,
the
city
of
new
york,
who
said
that
these
congressional
adjustments
were
the
complete
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
objections
in
his
dissent
in
the
ryan
case
that
the
stevedore
when
in
effect
the
suing
itself.
so
this
was
all
hashed
over
way
back
when
in
1956.
and
then
we
move
forward,
mr.
stearns
has
covered
the
1972
amendments,
but
we
move
forward
to
a
number
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
had.
and
in
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
edmonds
and
bloomer,
the
court
itself
has
read
this
particular
section
933
(b)
in
accordance
with
its
plain
meaning,
that
is
that
the
course
of
action
is
assigned
after
six
months
to
the
employer.
and
in
the
1972
amendments
when
they
added
section
905,
the
court
incorporated
section
933
into
that
section
and
said
he
may
sue
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
933
(b).
then
we
ran
into
a
consistent
line
of
cases
in
recent
years
by
this
court
where
if
a
court
follows
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
i
cite
the
caputo
case,
i
cite
the
rasmussen
case
where
they
discussed
the
plain
language
and
legislative
history,
the
examination
of
the
congressional
record,
the
reports
of
congress.
the
edmonds
case
also
discusses
that
point.
we
go
on
to
the
pfeiffer
case
against
ford
where
the
point
of
rest
question
was
considered
and
the
court
said
it
was
inconsistent
congressional
intent.
so
all
throughout
these
cases
right
down
to
the
bloomer
case
and
the
most
recent
case
on
december
15,
the
potomac
electric
case
where
again,
the
court
defers
to
congress
to
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
to
the
unambiguous
provisions,
even
where
they
--
they
may
reach
an
anomalous
result
and
i
think
that
case
involved
a
question
of
whether
schedule
awards
applied
or
the
man
could
take
his
--
his
wages.
and
the
court
said,
“we
might
have
done
otherwise
perhaps,
but
congress
has
said
this
and
this
is
the
way
we
have
to
rule.”
mr.
francis
x.
byrn
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
so
and
i
think
perhaps
this
court
and
yourself
said
so,
your
honor.
i
return
again
to
the
czaplicki
case
and
there,
the
court
in
discussing
the
conflict
said,
“under
the
peculiar
circumstances,
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
we
find
the
conflict.”
now
as
opposed
to
that,
we
have
the
caldwell
case
which
i
think
misinterprets
czaplicki,
and
says
on
page
1046,
"the
fundamental
point
in
czaplicki
is
that
notwithstanding
a
statutory
assignment
of
the
longshoreman's
right
of
action,
the
right
of
action
maybe
revested
in
the
longshoreman
when
it
becomes
manifest
that
the
assignee
with
knowledge
of
its
exclusive
right
to
control
and
prosecute
the
claim
nevertheless
declines
to
do
so
for
any
reason
not
because
of
a
conflict
but
for
any
reason."
and
then
it
goes
on
to
legislate
certain
procedures
that
are
followed,
again
taking
over
the
congressional
role
here.
now
i
think
congress
has
spoken
and
the
man
has
his
season
in
which
to
sue.
thereafter,
congress
really
intended
i
think
that
the
course
of
action
will
then
be
assigned
and
if
the
assignee
didn't
do
anything
about
it,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
two
intentions
not
to
sue.
one
man
--
manifested
by
the
man
himself
and
one
by
the
employer.
thank
you
very
much.
