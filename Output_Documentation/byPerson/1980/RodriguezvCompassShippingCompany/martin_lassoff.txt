mr.
martin
lassoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
lassoff
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
brought
as
a
result
of
a
conflict
in
the
interpretation
of
part
of
a
federal
--
federal
statute.
the
conflict
arises
in
the
application
of
section
933
(b)
of
an
act
known
as
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
this
act
was
last
amended
by
congress
in
1972
at
which
time
section
933
(b)
was
not
amended.
section
933
(b)
was
last
amended
in
1959
at
which
time
it
was
amended
to
give
the
longshoreman
an
additional
six
months
period
to
sue
from
the
date
of
a
formal
award
in
compensation.
mr.
martin
lassoff
it
does
but
this
was
not
one
of
the
points
i
was
given
certiorari
on.
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
view
in
all
three
of
these
cases,
there
was
never
an
order
which
triggered
this
mechanism,
but
that
was
not
one
of
the
points
that
we
were
given
certiorari
on.
the
american
association
of
trial
lawyers
have
raised
that
in
their
brief,
but
we
didn't
raise
it
in
our
brief
for
today.
mr.
martin
lassoff
it's
not
before
you.
the
point
involved
is
who
was
this
statute
designed
to
protect?
going
back
to
the
original
basis
in
law,
at
one
point,
a
longshoreman
had
to
elect
before
the
first
payment
of
compensation
whether
or
not
he
could
sue
a
third
party
because
if
he
accepted
one
payment
of
compensation,
his
rights
to
sue
were
assigned
absolutely
to
his
employer.
that
changed
until
he
was
given
the
right
to
accept
compensation
short
of
an
award.
if
he,
out
of
the
words,
if
there
was
voluntary
payment
of
compensation
for
a
man
who
was
out
for
six
months
and
the
employer
voluntary
pay
that
money,
that
would
not
give
the
case
to
his
employer.
but
if
there
was
a
hearing
at
which
permanency
was
decided,
and
an
order
was
entered,
that
order
gave
the
case
to
the
man's
employer.
in
1957
i
believe,
this
court
decided
blazey
czaplicki
case
which
said
that
conflict
of
interest
and
blazey
czaplicki
was
a
very
strong
conflict
of
interest
case.
the
insurance
carrier
represented
both
parties
to
the
litigation.
therefore
in
1959,
congress
amended
this
act
and
said,
â€œyou
can
keep
your
case
mr.
longshoreman
until
such
a
point
as
six
months
after
a
formal
award
because
we
have
several
interest
here.
all
of
this
is
based
on
a
quid
pro
quo
between
the
longshoreman
and
the
employer.
nowhere
is
the
shipping
company
or
the
shipping
corporations
mentioned
they
do
not
belong
in
the
statute
and
they
have
never
been
mentioned
until
1972
when
an
additional
part
of
the
statute
was
added
called
section
905
(d).
what
--
what
was
the
intent?
all
right.
after
--
after
the
enactment
of
this
act
by
congress
--
by
judicial
law,
certain
things
apply.
prior,
there
was
a
sieracki
case,
the
court
gave
longshoreman
the
right
to
sue
vessels
for
a
violation
of
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness.
subsequent,
the
ryan
case
gave
the
ship
companies
the
right
to
sue
the
employer
for
--
on
a
contract
basis
for
actual
or
implied
warranties
of
workmanlike
performance.
so
the
issue
was
sort
of
dead
because
any
employer
of
maritime
labor
obviously
had
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
employee
and
the
fact
that
they
would
immediately
be
brought
into
the
action
by
the
shipowner.
notwithstanding
that,
there
were
several
cases
in
that
period,
the
potomac
electric
power
company
case
and
mcclendon
against
charente
which
interpreted
the
meaning
of
section
933
(b).
both
of
these
cases
say
and
certainly
pepco
in
clear
language
say
that
any
time
there
is
a
failure
by
the
employer
or
the
persons
subrogated
to
the
employee's
rights
to
sue,
then
that
case
should
go
back
to
the
employee
and
that
it
is
not
up
to
the
employee
to
prove
a
conflict
of
interest
with
his
employer.
in
1972
as
stated,
there
was
sort
of
a
political
arrangement
made
between
the
stevedoring
companies
and
the
laborer
suppliers.
the
political
arrangement
was
that
in
exchange
for
a
substantial
increase
in
benefits,
the
longshoreman
would
have
certain
judicially
created
rights
taken
away
from
them.
they
would
have
the
right
of
a
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
taken
away
from
them.
the
shipowner,
in
exchange
for
that
benefit,
would
have
taken
away
from
it
the
judicialliated
--
judicially
created
application
of
ryan.
mr.
martin
lassoff
it
had
participation
of
the
long
--
of
the
maritime
unions,
non-sea
--
not
non-sea
unions
and
of
the
stevedores.
the
shipping
companies
had
no
part
in
this
arrangement
at
all.
it
was
strictly
the
longshoreman,
the
shipper
carriers,
the
stevedoring
companies.
this
was
not
really
a
bill
that
was
participated
in
or
abetted
by
shipping
interest.
this
was
strictly
stevedoring
interest
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
longshore
unions
were
aware
of
what
was
happening
because
in
1972,
there
was
no
application
of
a
six-month
assignment
because
quite
clearly,
congress,
being
in
this
circuit
and
pepco
which
is
a
dc
case
and
the
district
of
columbia
workers
which
are
covered
by
this
very
act,
since
the
act
is
silent
about
the
intent
of
this
section,
it
must
be
assumed
that
congress
believed
the
law
to
be
as
it
was
in
potomac
electric
power.
and
that
is
there
was
no
assignment
or
if
there
was,
it
would
revest
if
for
any
reason
the
right
to
bring
this
action
did
--
was
not
undertaken
properly.
in
czaplicki,
the
court
talks
about
a
trustee
situation
which
they
didn't
feel
necessary.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
did
think
it
necessary
but
it
wasn't
done.
we
have
certain
equitable
proceedings
here.
the
only
interest
that
the
shipowner
has
in
this
litigation
at
all
is
that
he'd
be
sued
by
the
real
party
in
interest,
one
lawsuit.
there
has
not
been
more
than
one
lawsuit
brought
since
1972,
since
the
decisions
in
rodriguez,
since
decisions
in
the
caldwell
against
ogden
steamship
company,
since
the
bandy
cases,
no
stevedoring
company
has
brought
a
lawsuit
to
enforce
its
statutory
lien.
we
have
been
successful
under
the
decision
in
rodriguez
which
indicated
that
ratification
was
a
measure
where
companies
were
willing
to
cooperate
to
get
certain
insurance
companies,
not
stevedoring
companies,
but
insurance
companies
of
stevedores
to
ratify
the
longshoreman's
course
of
action.
the
one
time
we
tried
the
suggestion
in
caldwell
which
was
involuntary
joinder,
that
was
against
the
company
called
international
terminal
operating
company,
their
attorney's
opposed
the
involuntary
joinder
and
was
denied.
but
the
fact
is
that
no
stevedoring
company
that
i
know
of
anywhere
has
ever
sued
a
ship
to
assert
the
claims
of
the
injured
employee
and
the
decision
that
a
longshoreman
can
prove
a
conflict
of
interest
which
is
so
apparent
on
the
face,
never
happened
without
means
of
extra
protection,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
lassoff
not
quite
your
honor
as
you
can
see
this
appeal
--
mr.
martin
lassoff
there
were
at
least
10
cases
here
your
honor.
there
are
five
in
virginia
or
three
and
five
here
--
all
in
this
one
appeal.
mr.
martin
lassoff
yes,
yes,
but
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
affected
by
this
particular.
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
in
the
district
court
now
which
are
on
a
so-called
suspense
calendar
because
of
this
--
the
--
this
particular
case.
mr.
martin
lassoff
ordinarily
he
does.
there
are
problems
when
you
are
dealing
with
foreign
flag
steamship
companies
as
92%
of
the
--
of
the
ships
coming
to
the
united
states
are.
they
are
difficulty
in
locating
the
company.
we
can
start
an
action
by
mail,
but
if
we
do
not
perfect
service,
the
courts
dismiss
these
actions
so
that
to
say
that
it
is
easy
to
start
these
actions
within
six
months
of
an
award
is
usually
so
but
not
always
so.
mr.
martin
lassoff
congress
could
do
many
things.
congress
could
compel
these
shipowners
to
post
a
bond
of
insurance
on
their
coming
here.
mr.
martin
lassoff
yes
or
an
agent
to
service.
none
of
these
things
had
worked
at
the
time.
mr.
martin
lassoff
the
question
is
--
is
not
a
period
of
time.the
question
is
what
is
the
intent
of
congress?
mr.
martin
lassoff
every
bill
--
every
bill
says
safety
--
this
is
hazardous
occupation,
eight
times
the
national
rate,
four
times
the
national
rate.
every
bill
says
that.
how
is
it
protecting
the
rights
of
this
longshoreman
by
saying
that
if
the
employer
does
not
sue,
a
party
not
intended
to
be
benefit
the
negligent
tortfeasor
has
an
absolute
indemnity
from
suit.
the
stevedoring
company
is
wasting
its
assets
which
are
intended
to
be
used
for
the
protection
of
longshoreman
and
we
all
--
mr.
martin
lassoff
that
is
true.
but
the
statute
says
that
since
this
is
such
a
hazardous
occupation,
the
only
way
we
know
of
is
to
make
the
employer
responsible.
we
want
these
benefits
to
be
substantially
increased
and
we
don't
want
the
employer
to
waste
its
benefits
by
not
collecting
them.
that
is
what
would
happen
here.
if
the
employer
does
not
sue
because
of
a
business
reason
and
i
have
said
they've
never
sued,
they
are
wasting
assets
that
probably
belong
to
the
longshoreman
who
has
80%
interest
in
the
remainder
of
the
case.
mr.
martin
lassoff
he
has
six
months
in
which
to
assert
it,
but
the
question
is
equitably,
equitably
does
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
is
it
--
is
it
perfected
by
giving
a
negligent
tortfeasor
a
right
that
it
was
never
intended
to
have?
mr.
martin
lassoff
i
say
--
mr.
martin
lassoff
i
have
no
objection
to
a
statute
of
limitations.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations.
this
is
not
the
statute
of
limitation.
mr.
martin
lassoff
it
isn't
because
every
lawyer
practicing
in
this
field
knew
of
the
various
statutes
of
limitations.
as
your
honor
pointed
out
to
me,
not
yourself,
nobody
knew
that
this
act
could
be
triggered
by
an
informal
agreement
of
a
claims
examiner
when
the
statute
specifically
said
that
it
had
to
be
the
deputy
commissioner
or
the
board.
this
is
the
problem.
we
are
making
a
--
a
statute
of
limitations
out
of
an
assignment.
the
assignment
wasn't
intended
to
hurt
the
employee,
it
was
intended
according
to
law
to
give
the
cause
of
action
to
the
employer
who
had
better
assets
to
pursue
it.
i
don't
believe
that
but
that
was
what
congress
specifically
stated.
now,
what
is
the
actual
fact?
the
actual
fact
is
that
employers
may
not
choose
to
do
this,
one
for
fear
of
antagonizing
their
customers,
bad
business
or
two,
their
lawyers
do
not
work
the
way
plaintiff's
lawyers
do
on
a
contingency
basis.
they
would
expect
to
be
paid
whether
they
won
or
lost.
and
i
say
to
you
that
the
best
person
to
have
these
rights
is
the
plaintiff's
lawyer,
the
plaintiff,
the
injured
worker.
if
he
has
a
right,
let
him
have
the
right
that
he
always
had,
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
an
employer
refuses
to
sue
and
we
can
give
the
employer
the
right
to
sue.
we
can
send
him
a
registered
letter,
if
you
don't
sue,
we're
going
to
sue.
that
protects
the
employer,
does
it
not?
but
why
should
this
injured
man
who
gets
nothing
for
pain
and
suffering,
who
gets
nothing
except
two
thirds
of
his
pay
and
unless
it's
permanent,
that
two
thirds
does
not
go
up
if
the
union
pay
scale
goes
up.
in
other
words,
the
best
that
a
longshoreman
can
get
here
is
two
thirds
of
his
pay
at
the
time
of
the
accident
regardless
of
whether
the
pay
scale
goes
up.
nothing
for
pain
and
suffering
and
while
you
will
hear
argument
that
the
pay
scale
went
up
a
great
deal,
in
certain
instances,
it
went
down
a
great
deal.
i
will
save
that
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
lassoff
just
a
couple
of
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
edmonds
which
is
a
decision
of
this
court
in
march
of
1979,
the
court
cautioned
that
this
change
in
the
statute
was
striking
a
delicate
balance
between
the
lore
as
it
was,
as
created
by
the
judiciary
and
congress,
and
as
amended
by
congress
taking
away
certain
rights.
nowhere
in
the
1972
bill
does
it
mention
the
six
months
statute
as
being
intended
to
take
anything
away
from
the
rights
of
the
longshoreman
and
mr.
justice
white
who
wrote
the
opinion
said
very
clearly
that
where
congress
has
been
silent
in
this
delicate
balance,
it
is
not
up
to
us
to
act.
congress
said
not
word
--
one
word
in
either
the
senate
or
house
about
this
section
and
this
section
was
not
changed
in
the
1972
amendments.
one
thing
that
isn't
too
vile,
but
as
mr.
justice
marshall
noted,
mr.
stearns
likes
to
roam
far
afield.
i
had
a
recent
situation
with
mr.
stearns
in
new
york
before
a
federal
judge,
judge
piers
where
mr.
stearns
--
mr.
martin
lassoff
no,
i
--
i
just
wanted
--
mr.
martin
lassoff
i'll
stop.
thank
you.
