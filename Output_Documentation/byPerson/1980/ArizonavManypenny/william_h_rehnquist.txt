justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
what
i
meant,
that
a
defendant
prior
to
1900
in
a
capital
case
could
appeal.
justice
rehnquist
in
a
diversity
case
that's
removed
to
federal
court
from
state
court,
that's
just
a
simple
civil
action,
the
federal
statute
controls
the
appealability
of
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
i
realize
that
but
i
mean,
i'm
hunting
around
for
some
analogy.
supposing
you
simply
had
a
civil
action
which
was
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
pima
county
and
properly
removed
by
the
defendant
to
the
district
court
of
arizona,
and
after
judgment
one
of
the
parties
wants
to
appeal.
he
looks
to
the
federal
statutes
governing
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit,
does
he
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
we
decide
in
favor
of
you
on
the
first
question
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
would
not
reach
the
second
question.
the
9th
circuit
shouldn't
then
have
dismissed
the
appeal
and
we
should
simply
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
9th
circuit
and
send
it
back
to
the
9th
circuit.
justice
rehnquist
no,
you
do
the
responding.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
whitney,
let
me
ask
you
to
go
back
for
just
a
moment.
there
was
a
judgment
entered
in
this
case,
wasn't
there?
justice
rehnquist
then
look
at
page
18
of
your
brief,
the
statutory
subsection
5,
specifying
appealability.
"an
order
made
after
judgment
affecting
the
substantial
rights
of
the
state.
"
wouldn't
this
come
under
that
heading?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
trial
court
couldn't
do
something
and
it's
another
thing
to
say
you
can't
appeal
from
what
it
has
done,
whether
it
was
authorized
by
law
to
do
it
or
not.
i
would
have
read
the
subsection
5
as
authorizing
an
appeal
by
the
state
if
an
order
was
made
after
judgment
affecting
substantial
rights
of
the
state,
as
this
certainly
did.
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
state
presumably
wouldn't
want
to
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
conviction.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice
rehnquist
this
whole
case
is
one
that
falls
between
the
cracks,
in
a
sense,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
that
congress
has
provided
for
removal
to
a
federal
court
when
a
federal
officer
is
tried.
the
state
has
set
up
a
criminal
prosecution
system
and
provided
for
appeal
by
the
state
in
certain
instances.
the
congress
has
also
provided
for
appeals
from
united
states
under
the
criminal
code.
and
this
simply
was
never
focused
on.
justice
rehnquist
okay.
justice
rehnquist
attacking
the
right
to
remove.
that
was
it.
that
involved
the
propriety
of
removal.
justice
rehnquist
did
he
discuss
at
all
the
appealability
of
a
post-trial
motion
under
maryland
law?
justice
rehnquist
but
at
least
that
statute
was
enacted
after
the
maryland
v.
soper
dicta,
for
a
state?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
this
had
not
been
a
removed
prosecution
but
simply
a
prosecution
by
the
united
states,
and
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
and
the
united
states
appealed
and
the
defendant
claimed
double
jeopardy,
should
the
court
of
appeals
dismiss
the
appeal
or
examine
the
complaint,
or
examine
the
case
and
affirm,
or
reverse?
justice
rehnquist
i
know,
but
supposing
we
were
dealing
with
something
that
had
originated
in
the
district
court?
justice
rehnquist
and
a
judgment
of
acquittal
had
been
entered.
justice
rehnquist
a
judgment
of
acquittal
entered
by
the
court
afterward.
justice
rehnquist
the
court
did
cite
united
states
v.
sanges,
in
saying
that
there
would
be
no
appeal
by
the
state
after
verdict,
didn't
it?
