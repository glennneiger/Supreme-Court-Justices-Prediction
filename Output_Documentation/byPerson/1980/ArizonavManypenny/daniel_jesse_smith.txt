mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
review
two
questions.
the
first
is
whether
a
state
government
is
stripped
of
its
right
to
appeal
whenever
a
state
criminal
prosecution
is
removed
by
the
defendant
to
federal
district
court
pursuant
to
the
federal
removal
statute.
the
second
question
on
which
review
was
granted
was
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment
of
acquittal
pursuant
to
rule
29(c)
on
its
own
motion
beyond
the
seven-day
limit
called
for
in
rule
29(c),
in
this
case
11
months
after
a
jury
has
returned
a
guilty
verdict.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
shooting
that
took
place
in
southern
arizona
in
march,
1976.
respondent
manypenny
was
employed
as
a
united
states
border
patrol
agent.
while
he
was
on
duty
taking
aliens
into
custody
near
the
mexican
border
he
shot
an
unarmed
alien
in
the
back
as
the
alien
was
heading
back
towards
mexico.
the
respondent
was
indicted
by
the
state
of
arizona
for
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
the
respondent
filed
a
removal
petition
and
the
trial
was
held
in
the
federal
district
court.
respondent
was
convicted
by
a
jury
and
then
filed
a
rule
33
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
a
rule
34
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment.
respondent
never
filed
a
rule
29(c)
motion
seeking
a
post-verdict
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
district
court
initially
granted
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
the
state
then
moved
for
reconsideration
of
this
order.
the
district
court
took
no
action
for
11
months
and
then
reversed
its
rule
in
arresting
judgment
and
instead,
sua
sponte,
construed
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
as
a
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
state
of
arizona
appealed
to
the
9th
circuit
alleging
two
things,
first
that
the
district
court
was
wholly
without
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
judgment
of
acquittal
on
its
own
motion
11
months
after
the
verdict.
and
secondly,
even
assuming
arguendo
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
that
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
error
on
the
face
of
the--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--no,
we
didn't
petition
on
that
issue,
your
honor,
and
the
9th
circuit
did
not
address
it.
a
divided
9th
circuit
held
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
appeal
when
a
state
criminal
prosecution
is
removed
to
federal
court,
irrespective
of
whether
that
state
has
the
right
to
appeal
in
its
own
courts.
judge
kennedy
in
dissent
found
that
both
18
u.s.c.
3731
provided
the
court
of
appeals
with
a
basis
for
hearing
the
case;
and
he
also
found
that
in
the
alternative
28
u.s.c.
1291,
which
provides
for
review
of
all
final
decisions
in
the
district
courts,
would
also
give
the
9th
circuit
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal.
judge
kennedy's
dissent
further
examined
the
merits
of
the
case
and
he
stated
that
he
would
reverse
the
judgment
of
acquittal
and
reinstate
the
verdict.
even
the
majority
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
concerns
of
congress
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
3731
are
equally
applicable
to
removed
state
criminal
prosecution.
they
further
stated
that
their
decision
would
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the
delicate
balance
of
our
federal
system.
the
majority
opinion
vests
every
federal
district
court
in
the
country
with
unreviewable
power
to
block
any
state
criminal
prosecution
of
a
federal
removal
defendant.
it
creates
a
specially
privileged
class
of
defendants
in
federal
court
who
can
enjoy
the
unreviewable
benefits
of
judicial
errors
committed
in
their
favor,
and
it
will
serve
to
encourage
forum
shopping.
the
solicitor
general
filed
an
amicus
brief
at
the
request
of
this
court.
they
took
the
position
that
both
13
u.s.c.
3731
and
28
u.s.c.
1291
gave
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
state's
appeal
and
they
further
stated
that
the
policy
considerations
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
the
removal
statute
in
the
first
place
are
in
no
way
furthered
by
the
decision
of
the
9th
circuit
which
simply
gave
a
windfall
benefit
to
removal
defendants.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes.
its
history
is
traced
in
this
court's
opinion
in
willingham
v.
morgan.
it
apparently
goes
back
to
1812,
and
then
it
was
allowed
to
lapse
for
a
long
while
and
was
revived
after
the
civil
war.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
certain
state
courts
allowed
appeals
but--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--in
federal
court
there
wasn't
any
right
to
an
appeal
until
1907.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
no,
and
i
think
the
sanges
case
of
this
court
states
that
prior
to
the
late
1880s
there
wasn't
even
an
appeal
by
a
defendant
in
federal
court;
nobody
had
a
right
to.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
but
i
know
that
there
was
no
general
right
to
appeal
for
a
defendant
prior
to
the
act
that
was
construed
in
sanges.
this
court
in
younger
v.
harris
stated
that,
"since
the
beginning
of
our
nation's
history
congress
has
manifested
a
desire
to
let
state
courts
try
state
cases
free
from
interference
by
federal
courts,
subject
to
a
few
sharply
delineated
exceptions.
"
in
colorado
v.
symes,
which
was
a
1932
removal
case
before
this
court,
the
court
stated
that
the
right
of
a
state
government
to
enforce
its
criminal
laws
is
equal
to
the
right
of
the
federal
government,
and
that
the
removal
statute
before
the
court
had
to
be
construed
with
the
highest
regard
for
that
equality.
in
tennessee
v.
davis,
which
was
the
seminal
case
in
removal
jurisprudence...
that
was
an
1880
decision
by
this
court,
the
court
set
forth
the
rule
that
for
the
trial
of
removal
cases
the
federal
district
courts
are
to
apply
the
substantive
law
of
the
states
and
the
procedural
law
of
the
federal
courts.
and
this
was
codified
in
rule
54(b)(1)
and
the
comment
to
rule
54(b)(1)
makes
it
explicit
that
in
the
intended
removals
of
prosecution,
the
state
government
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
united
states
government
for
procedural
purposes.
arizona
law
allows
for
appellate
review
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
irrespective
of
whether
the
court
deems
the
right
to
appeal
by
the
sovereign
to
be
substantive
or
procedural;
the
state
of
arizona--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--tennessee
v.
davis.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
this
hasn't
come
up
before.
at
that
time,
it
would
be
our
position
that
had
the
state
government
provided
for
the
right
to
appeal
in
its
own
courts
and
were
the
right
to
appeal
deemed
substantive
rather
than
procedural,
then
there
would
have
been
a
right
to
appeal
under
tennessee
v.
davis,
but
that
never
arose.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes,
if
davis
is
applied
literally,
that
would
have
been
the
case.
but
again,
that's
not
before
this
court
because--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
in
tennessee
v.
davis,
it
got
to
this
court
prior
to
trial
where
the
state
of
tennessee
was
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
removal
act
itself.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
i
would
assume
by
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
i
haven't
re
read
the
case
recently,
so--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--but
the
state
of
tennessee
raised
two
contentions.
one,
they
contended
that
removal
was
per
se
unconstitutional,
and
i
obviously
didn't
read
the
briefs
on
that
case
but
i
think
some
of
the
history
that
i
cited
in
my
opening
brief
would
lay
the
basis
for
that.
that
was
rejected
by
the
court.
the
second
contention
was
that
congress
in
enacting
the
removal
statute
had
not
provided
for
any
explicit
procedure
for
the
trial
of
removal
cases,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
objection
that
respondent
raised
in
this
case,
that
there's
no
explicit
authorization
for
a
removal
appeal
in
a
removal
case.
this
court
rejected
that
as
being
a
frivolous
argument.
they
said
that
the
mode
of
trial
was
sufficiently
obvious,
and
federal
courts
are
equipped
to
set
forth
that
rule.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
your
honor,
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
issue
because
the
state
of
arizona,
which
is
the
only
state
i'm
representing
today,
does
provide
for
appeals
in
this
type
of
situation.
however,
under
arizona
state
law,
the
right
to
appeal
is
a
substantive
right,
although
the
mode
that
appeal
takes
is
considered
procedural.
obviously,
that
shouldn't
govern
in
this
court.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
i
think
that
was
the
position
the
solicitor
general
took,
although
they
noted--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
after
i've
reiterated
the
fact
that
it's
unnecessary
for
the
disposition
of
this
case,
it
would
be
our
position--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
under
most
of
the
case
law
that
i've
read,
substantive
law
defines
what
is
a
crime
and
the
punishment
for
a
crime,
and
procedure
governs
how
that
result
is
supposed
to
be
reached.
it
would
be
our
position
that
because
of
the
different
nature
of
state
and
federal
judicial
systems,
different
controls,
direct
and
indirect,
over
the
petitioner,
that--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
we
would
rely
both
on
3731,
which
provides,
subsection
(e),
that
the
provisions
of
this
statute
shall
be
liberally
construed
to
effectuate
its
purposes.
the
purposes
of
3731--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--that
would
be
our
position,
were
we
faced
with
that
situation.
but
again,
the
state
of
arizona
isn't.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
no,
we're
also
relying
on
1291
under
the
basis
of
the
literal
language
of
1291.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
if
the
court's
going
to
base
its
decision
on
1291,
that
would--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--because
one
of
respondent's
arguments
is
that
congress
never
explicitly
provided
for
this
situation,
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
because
tennessee
v.
davis
was
decided
in
1880,
27
years
before
the
first
criminal
appeals
act
was
passed
in
1907--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--right.
that's--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--that's
our
theory.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
if
the
court's
asking
about
the
erie
doctrine,
this
isn't
a
classic
diversity
case.
this
is
not--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--i
would
think,
again...
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
civil
law,
but
on
the
erie
question,
which
is
useful
by
analogy,
i
would
request
that
the
court
consider
the
late
chief
justice
warren's
opinion
in
hanna
v.
plumer,
in
which
he
said
that
the
twin
policies
of
the
erie
doctrine,
were
to
discourage
forum
shopping
and
to
the
avoidance
of
the
inequitable
administration
of
justice.
and
i
would
submit
that
both
those
policy
considerations
are
undercut
by
the
decision
of
the
9th
circuit
and
would
be
furthered
by
a
ruling
from
this
court
that
a
state
does
retain
its
right
to
appeal.
when
a
criminal
prosecution
is
removed.
in
united
states
v.
wilson,
which
was
the
case
where
this
court
interpreted
the
modern
version
of
3731,
per
justice
marshall,
wrote
that
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
amendment
was
to
eliminate
all
statutory
barriers
to
government
appeals
and
to
allow
appeals
whenever
the
constitution
would
permit.
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
noted
in
that
opinion,
there
is
no
right
to
benefit
from
a
judicial
error
committed
in
your
favor,
when
that
can
be
reviewed
without
subjecting
the
defendant
to
a
second
trial.
we
submit
that
wilson
controls
this
case,
even
if
tennessee
v.
davis
didn't;
unless
the
court's
going
to
retreat
from
the
language
in
wilson
that
it
does,
there
is
no
statutory
barrier
to
this
appeal,
and
therefore
it's
authorized
under
3731.
in
the
alternative--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--yes.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
if
the
appeal
rights
of
the
state
again
are
to
be
predicated
on
3731,
that
would
be
logical
that
we
would
have
the
same
rights
as
the
united
state
government,
were
prosecution
commenced
by
the
united
states
government.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes.
that
would
be
simpler
to
administer.
in
the
alternative,
if
this
court
finds
that
the
words
3731
do
preclude
that
statute
as
being
used
for
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
this
appeal,
we
submit
that
1291
should
also
be
read
literally
and
that
this
appeal
is
plainly
authorized
by
the
all-final
decision
language
in
that
statute.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
that's
not
so,
because
prior
decisions
of
this
court
prior
to
the
amendment
of
3731
and
wilson
did
hold
that
the
united
states
government
couldn't
appeal
except
where
expressly
authorized
by
statute.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
that's
the
general
drift
of
the
court's--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--because
now
1291
should
be
read
in
light
of
the
congressional
amendment
to
3731,
which
is
the--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--yes,
in
the
9th
circuit,
in
the
united
states
v.
hetrick,
which
was
the
case
that
was
decided
september
16,
that
i
sent
to
the
court
several
weeks
ago,
they
did
hold
that
in
light
of
the
new
construction
of
3731,
that
1291
did
provide
the
basis
for
a
government
appeal
in
a
criminal
case,
although
that
was
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
government,
not
a
state.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
on
the
first
issue,
we
would
request
that
the
court
not
ratify
the
creation
of
a
specially
privileged
class
of
defendants
at
the
expense
of
state
sovereignty.
we
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
a
state
does
not
lose
its
right
to
appeal
in
a
removal
case.
on
the
second
question
presented--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--yes.
although
the
second
issue
can
still
be
reviewed
and
considered
pursuant
to
this
court's
mandamus
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
1651,
because
mandamus,
as
this
court's
prior
decisions
have
held,
does
not
lie
where
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
by
appeal.
but
if
the
court
decides
the
first
question
adversely
to
petitioner
and
the
court
goes
on
to
find
what
this
district
court
was
wholly
without
jurisdiction
to
have
entered
this
order,
then
the
9th
circuit
and
this
court
both
have
jurisdiction
to
reinstate
the
verdict
pursuant
to
its
mandamus
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
the
court
could
certainly
do
that.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
submit
there
are
several
compelling
reasons
why
the
court
ought
to
take
the
second
issue.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
yes,
and
they
were
both
fully
briefed
below,
in
the
courts
below.
if
mr.
justice
rehnquist
would
like
the
response
as
to
why
we
should
take
jurisdiction,
i'll--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--okay.
we
would
submit
that
perhaps
the
most
compelling
consideration
for
this
court
not
to
remand
it
to
the
9th
circuit
would
be
considerations
of
comity;
that
this
case
is
more
than
four
years
old,
it's
gone
through
four
prior
decisions
already,
and
we're
in
an
extremely
delicate
area
of
federal-state
relations
in
removal
jurisprudence.
secondly,
judge
kennedy
in
dissent
stated
that
he
took
a
position
in
conflict
with
the
5th
and
10th
circuits
and
would
find
that
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
untimely
judgment
of
acquittal.
and
while,
obviously,
that's
a
dissent
and
not
controlling,
under
your
supervisory
powers
you
know
that
you
have
a
judge
down
below
who's
on
record
as
taking
what
we
submit
is
a
wrong
position,
and
that
would
be
a
further
reason
for
this
court
to
consider
the
second
issue.
as
i
stated
in
my
statement
of
facts
previously,
in
this
case
no
rule
29(c)
motion
was
made
by
respondent
at
any
time.
rule
29(c)
in
its
text
provides
for
a
7-day
limit
for
the
making
of
such
motion
or
for
the
asking
of
an
extension
of
time
to
make
such
motion.
there
is
nothing
in
respondent's
rule
33
and
rule
34
motion,
both
of
which
are
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
5
and
16,
that
can
be
construed
as
an
allegation
that
the
state
failed
to
produce
sufficient
evidence
at
this
trial.
had
it
been
labeled
a
rule
33
motion
but
had
attacked
the
sufficiency
of
the
state's
evidence,
that
would
be
a
different
case,
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
in
united
states
v.
smith
case,
which
dealt
with
rule
33
motions,
this
court
in
1948
held
that
virtually
identical
language
was
in
fact
jurisdictional
and
set
forth
several
policy
reasons
why
the
rule
should
be
literally
enforced.
the
5th
and
10th
circuits
have
both
held
that
the
seven-day
limit
is
in
fact
the
jurisdictional
limit,
and
we
submit
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
not
to
extend
the
identical
ruling
that
this
court
did
in
the
smith
case
to
rule
29(c)
motions,
since
the
identical
relief
can
be
obtained
by
this
respondent
or
any
defendant
on
direct
appeal
or
on
federal
habeas.
if
there
is
insufficient
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
record,
that
can
certainly
be
dealt
with
on
appeal.
the
district
court
if
he
somehow
feels
that
he's
missed
something
can
release
the
defendant
on
an
appeal
bond
or
on
his
own
recognizance
pending
appeal.
and
in
that
situation
the
case
will
be
reviewed
on
a
full
set
of
transcripts
with
a
full
set
of
briefs.
in
the
instant
case,
the
state
had
no
notice
whatsoever
that
the
federal
district
court
was
even
considering
this
motion,
and
did
not
have
any
transcripts
prepared
prior
to
the
entry
of
this
order.
and
as
judge
kennedy
noted
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
the
reasons
that
the
judge
advanced
for
the
granting
of
the
judgment
of
acquittal
in
his
opinion,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
cert,
bear
no
relation
to
what
appears
in
the
transcripts.
and
that's
the
consequence,
we
submit,
of
dealing
with
the
case
11
months
after
the
fact
outside
the
time
limit
provided
for
in
rule
29(c).
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
just
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
maryland
v.
soper
case
which
my
brother
whitney
has
cited
on
page
23
of
his
brief,
that
has
to
be
read
in
context
of
the
procedural
posture
of
that
case.
mr.
soper
had
not
been
to
trial.
he
had
filed
a
removal
petition
that
had
been
granted
and
the
state
of
maryland
was
challenging
the
granting
of
the
removal
petition,
which
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
and...
if
i
can
read
from
the
opinion
as
reproduced
in
mr.
whitney's
brief,
it
says,
"the
order
of
the
united
states
district
judge
in
refusing
to
remand
is
not
open
to
review
on
a
writ
of
error
and
judgment
of
acquittal
in
that
court
is
final.
"
and
right
in
that
context,
what
he's
saying
is
that
if
the
case
proceeds
to
trial
without
it
being
considered
on
a
mandamus
by
this
court,
should
the
jury
come
back,
"not
guilty",
or
if
he
knows
that
he's
prior
to
wilson,
perhaps
if
the
judge
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
that
was
considered
nonreviewable
back
then,
that
the
state
was
out
of
luck,
so
if
they
don't
consider
it
on
mandamus
prior
to
trial,
the
state's
going
to
have
no
right
at
all.
it's
not
the
situation
where
the
state
was
trying
to
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
united
states
government
under
the
writ
of
error
act
of
1907.
and
it
really
has
no
application
to
this
case
other
than
the
statement
that
appears
further
in
that
case
which
i
cited
in
either
my
brief
or
my
petition,
where
mr.
chief
justice
taft
says
that
in
removal
cases
the
use
of
mandamus
would
be
more
liberally
applied
than
in
normal
cases.
and
to
that
extent
that
the
court
feels
it
necessary
to
reach
the
mandamus
issue
in
resolving
this,
we
would
submit
that
maryland
v.
soper
is
authority
that
this
court
ought
to
grant
our
petition
for
mandamus.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
no,
he
just
said
in
that
that
there
would
be
no
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal
and
it's
not
clear
from
the
opinion
whether
he's
talking
about
a
postverdict
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
assume
he
meant
from
a
jury
verdict
of
acquittal
taking
place
in
the
federal
district
court,
because
maryland
v.
soper
had
not
proceeded
to
trial
at
the
time
that
this
court
considered
it
upon
mandamus.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
the
only
other
point
i
wanted
to--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
but
that
wasn't
in
maryland
v.
soper,
and
it's
more
like
it's
dicta
coming
out
of
it
in
a
different--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--yes.
that
was
true
in
1924.
there
was
no
right
to
appeal.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
it
didn't
say
that.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
well,
if
the
jury
had
come
back
"not
guilty",
it
would
have
been
moot
to
review
the
propriety
of--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
that's
theoretically
possible
but
it
wasn't--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--conceivably,
but
that
wasn't
before
the
court
back
then.
it's--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--maryland
v.
soper
was
on
removal
only.
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
that's
all
it
was
about.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
that's
not
in
the
quotation
from
mr.
whitney.
if
that's
what
it
says,
that's
what
it
says.
but
again,
sanges
was
decided
in
1892,
long
prior
to
the
current
version
of
3731,
and
we're
dealing
with
not
only
a
different
procedural
posture,
but
a
completely
different
statute.
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
address
was
mr.
whitney's
comments
that
arizona
law
does
not
provide
for
appellate
review
in
the
circumstance.
the
cases
that
we
cite
on
page
34
of
our
opening
brief,
and
that
judge
kennedy
cited
in
his
dissent
at
pages
23
through
24a
and
38a
of
the
petition,
clearly
hold
that
in
certain
circumstances,
including
where
a
judgment
of
acquittal
has
been
entered
by
a
superior
court
judge,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
a
district
court
judge,
an
appeal
can
lie.
that
issue
wasn't
even
squarely
addressed,
and
i
would--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--well,
there
are
two
cases
where
it
was
addressed
by
appeal.
one
is
state
v.
gradillas,
which
is
at
544
pacific
2d
1111.
the
judgment
of
acquittal
was
entered
at
a
motion
to
suppress,
which
was
not
the
posture
in
this
case.
that
was
set
aside
on
appeal
without
any
discussion
of
the
jurisdictional
aspects.
but
in
state
v.
allen,
which
is
also
cited
by
judge
kennedy,
that's
at
557
pacific
2d
176,
there
was
a
jury
verdict
of
guilty.
it
was
set
aside
by
the
trial
court
and
in
an
untimely
manner.
that
case
first
went
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
on
petition
for
special
action,
which
is
roughly
equivalent
to
mandamus
but
not
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
the
state
supreme
court
remanded
it
at...
reversed
that
and
said
that
was
untimely
and
sent
it
back.
then
the
superior
court
judge
then
entered
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
insufficient
evidence
had
been
adduced
by
the
state
to
rebut
the
defense
of
insanity.
that
was
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
an
appeal
under
subsection
3
of
ars
13-1712,
which
sets
out
the
state's
right
to
appeal.
and
that
subsection
reads,
a
motion
arresting
judgment.
and
that
case
cited
united
states
v.
wilson
in
it
for
the
proposition
that
you
could
review
a
postverdict
entry
of
judgment
of
acquittal
without
violating--
mr.
daniel
jesse
smith
--i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case,
your
honor.
but
there
are
several
other
cases
that
were
cited
by
judge
kennedy
as
well
as
the
case
that
i
sent
in
on
the
supplemental
petition
for
certiorari,
state
v.
superior
court
at
606
pacific
2d
411,
where
the
arizona
supreme
court
vacated
the
untimely
entry
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
essentially
the
exact
same
facts
of
this
case,
by
special
action.
and
if
you
read
the
sub-3
in
my
opening
brief,
in
conjunction
with
these
cases
where
it's
been
granted
by
appeal,
it's
plain
that
any
order
that
doesn't
violate...
any
appellate
review
that
doesn't
violate
double
jeopardy
is
authorized
by
arizona
case
law
and
state
statute.
and
again,
even
if
this
court
might,
reading
the
state
statutes,
might
read
them
differently,
that's
not
for
this
court
to
do.
the
state
supreme
court
is
the
final
arbiter
on
state
law
and
not
a
federal
court,
absent
some
unconstitutional
interpretation
in
the
strict
construction
field
which
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
about
anything
about
this
case,
that's
all
i've
got.
thank
you.
