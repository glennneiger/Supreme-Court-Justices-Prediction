justice
blackmun
mr.
whitney,
is
your
client
still
in
the
border
patrol?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
also
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
william
manypenny
was
employed
as
a
border
patrol
agent
in
the
united
states
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
in
one
night
in
1976
while
he
and
another
agent
were
patrolling
the
sweetwater
pass
in
pima
county,
arizona
approximately
10
miles
from
the
mexican
border,
they
came
across
three
persons
suspected
of
being
illegal
alien
entrance.
and
during
the
encounter,
agent
manypenny
fired
a
shotgun
and
seriously
wounded
one
of
the
suspects.
manypenny
was
indicted
for
a
commission
of
a
state
crime
that
is
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
violation
of
an
arizona
statute.
however,
because
this
charge
arose
from
an
act
committed
while
he
was
on
duty
as
a
federal
border
patrol
agent,
manypenny
as
he
could
remove
the
case
from
state
court
into
federal
court.
a
jury
trial
took
place
there
and
a
verdict
of
guilty
was
returned.
but
thereafter,
the
district
court
concluded
that
manypenny
had
a
valid
immunity
defense
and
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
state
of
arizona
appealed
but
the
federal
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
case
or
the
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
it
held
that
a
criminal
proceeding
removed
to
a
federal
court
arose
under
federal
law
and
accordingly
is
controlled
by
that
law.
the
court
rejected
the
suggestion
that
arizona's
appeal
was
authorized
by
section
1291
of
title
28
a
jurisdictional
statute
relating
to
appeals
from
final
judgments
of
federal
district
courts.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
in
a
criminal
proceeding
removed
from
a
state
to
federal
court,
a
state
may
appeal
if
statutory
authority
to
seek
such
review
is
conferred
by
state
law.
because
arizona
law
conferred
such
authority
here
and
because
the
removal
does
not
alter
the
nature
of
the
authority
conferred,
the
state
must
be
allowed
to
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
acquittal
entered
after
the
verdict
of
guilty.
the
defendant
by
obtaining
a
federal
forum
fully
vindicated
in
the
federal
policy
supporting
removal.
no
further
purpose
of
the
removal
statute
would
be
served
by
denying
the
state
the
right
to
seek
review
when
that
very
right
is
available
under
state
law.
we
think
it
would
be
anomalous
to
conclude
that
the
state's
appellate
right
which
it
clearly
had
under
state
law
was
diminished
solely
because
of
the
removal.
section
1291
neither
compels
nor
forecloses
appellate
jurisdiction
over
an
appeal
taken
by
a
state
as
prosecutor.
instead,
it
permits
the
state
to
appeal
if
it
is
authorized
to
do
so
by
a
state
law.
arizona
can
rely
on
section
1291
combined
with
appellate
authorization
from
the
arizona
legislature.
and
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
no
more
is
required.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
cases
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
today.
mr.
justice
stevens,
while
joining
the
opinion,
has
filed
a
separate
concurrence.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
