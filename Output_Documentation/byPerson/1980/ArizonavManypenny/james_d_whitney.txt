mr.
james
d.
whitney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
there
is
one
fundamental
difference
and
i
think
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
resolve
that
difference
before
the
case
makes
any
sense
at
all,
and
that
is
the
constant
references
by
counsel
to
the
appealability
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal
under
the
arizona
state
statutes.
there
is
no
such
right.
now,
it
was
argued
by
judge
kennedy
in
his
dissent
that
there
was
language
talking
about
jurisdiction
being
given
to
the
state
or
to
the
appellate
courts
for
states'
appeals
in
orders
rendered
after
judgment.
one
could
say,
well,
perhaps
loosely.
this
is
the
legislature
saying
in
effect,
what
we
have
here
is
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
all
right,
that's
a
great
argument
until
you
read
those
rights
given
to
the
defendant
in
the
state
of
arizona
to
appeal,
where
they
specifically
state,
and
specifically
set
forth
judgments
of
acquittal.
so
there
is
no
right,
and
i
would
refer,
please,
to
pages
17
and
18
of
our
brief.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
that
apparently
is
true,
sir.
that
apparently
is,
he
is
taking--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--why
i
bring
that,
there
was
quite
a
colloquy
between
counsel,
justice
white,
concerning
what
basis
it
was
that
he
was
appealing
on,
and
i
never
got
it
straight
that
he
wasn't
attempting
to--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--he
submits
as
policy
argument
the
fact
that
there
was
an
appeal
and--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--that's
right,
sir.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
i
hope
that
the
court
takes
that
position
in
rendering
a
decision,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
at
least
three
grounds
that
counsel
is
proffering
as
a
basis
for
appeal,
and
the
principal
ground
among
those
is
that
appeal
should
be
allowed
not
only
by
reason
of
the
language
in
3731
calling
for
a
liberal
construction...
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
liberal
construction
applies
to
this
section,
3731.
congress
did
not
say,
in
each
and
every
instance
where
there
is
an
appeal,
whether
by
the
state
or
by
the
united
states,
that
there
should
be
liberal
construction.
it's
that
kind
of
transfusion
that
we
have
in
united
states
v.
hetrick
that
has
created
so
much
conflict
in
this
area.
now,
insofar
as
section
3731
is
concerned,
that
speaks
solely
of
the
united
states,
as
judge
choy
in
the
majority
decision
specifically
set
forth:
"the
united
states
is
an
entity.
"
"the
united
states
is
not
the
several
states;
the
united
states.
"
--this
is
key,
now...
"the
united
states
is
not
the
possessions,
the
district
of
columbia
and
so
forth
for
purposes
of
federal
judicial
jurisdiction.
"
mr.
james
d.
whitney
yes,
there
was;
yes,
there
was.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
well,
sir,
i
believe
you're
referring
first
of
all
to
our
order.
we
had
an
order
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
order
was
granting
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
in
this
case
i
think
that
this
statute,
and
the
cases
that
i've
seen
construing
this
statute,
they
happen
to
have
been
cited
by
judge
kennedy
in
the
9th
circuit.
it's
dawson
and
allen,
state
v.
dawson
and
allen.
they
were
speaking
about
the
court
having
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
this
is
the
allen
case.
and
then,
some
time
beyond
the
seven-day
limit
as
provided
in
arizona,
some
point
after
that,
entering
an
order
vacating
that
judgment
in
that
case.
the
court
held
that
it
was
far
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court
to
enter
an
order
after
the
judgment.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
it
affected
it;
it
was
a
judgment,
and
i
would
point,
sir,
in
the
response
to
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
estate
of
state
v.
hunt,
where
the
arizona
appellate
statute
was
almost
identical
to
the
one
that
we
have
before
us
today.
and
in
state
v.
hunt,
the
court
held
unequivocally
that
there
was
no
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
just
said
that
the
state
legislature
had
not
seen
fit
to
so
expressly
provide.
and
my
argument
is
this,
further,
if
i
may
go
on.
my
argument
is
that
the
legislature
was
fully
aware
of
the
importance
of
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
chose
to
designate
appealability
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
the
case
of
a
defendant,
while
in
the
case
of
the
state
omitting
it
entirely.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
it
probably
wouldn't;
you're
correct,
judge.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
state
v.
hunt,
sir,
and
it
was
in
my
response
to
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
yes,
sir.
i
don't
mean
to
mislead
the
court.
as
i
remember
state
v.
hunt,
the
situation
was
this,
an
appeal
by
defendant...
and
we
do
have
to
envision
then
that
the
state
may
counter
appeal
on
matters
of
law...
the
court
simply
said,
it
is
not
important
to
us
whether
or
not
the
defense
in
this
particular
instance
has
appealed.
we
are
simply
holding
that
the
statute
does
not
expressly
provide
for
the
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
part
of
the
state.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
it
was
in
my
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
sir,
state
v.
hunt.
it
was
second
division
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
arizona.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
his
employment
was
terminated,
i
believe,
some
three
or
four
months
after
this
indictment
came
down
in
this
case.
he
was
relieved
as
soon
as
the
indictment
came
down.
now,
1291,
as
i
believe
it
has
been
pointed
out,
and
responses
made
by
counsel
to
the
court,
the
prior
law
as
far
as
28
u.s.c.
1291
was
that
that
covered
criminal
matters
only
so
far
as
those
matters
were
ancillary
to
or
an
adjunct
to
the
general
framework
or
fabric
of
the
criminal
case
itself.
there
was
one
instance.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
in
what
respect,
sir?
mr.
james
d.
whitney
it
was
at
one
time,
sir,
if
i
may?
mr.
james
d.
whitney
in
the
case
of
maryland
v.
soper,
and
they
call
it
number
one,
that
chief
justice
taft
rendered
a
decision
on.
chief
justice
taft
was
faced
with
the
propriety
of
a
mandamus
to
this
court,
whether
or
not
the
petition
of
removal
as
required
under
statute
at
that
time
had
been
met
in
the
petition
filed,
i
believe
it
was
in
maryland
or
tennessee.
it's
one
of
these
illegal
still
cases.
at
any
rate,
justice
taft
said
that
in
granting
his
writ
of
mandamus
and
in
examining
the
allegations
of
the
petition,
the
amended
petition,
and
finding
them
inadequate
said,
now,
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
granting
this
writ
of
mandamus
is
that
when
these
folks
get
down
the
line
on
this
removal
case
no
writ
of
error
will
issue,
and
no
rights
of
appeal
will
be
available.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
maryland
v.
soper,
sir.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
now,
the
implications
of
that
decision
are
that
in
1924
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
found,
they
had
to
find,
that
the
state
in
a
removal
action
had
no
right
of
appeal.
i
doubt,
reading
the
case,
that
had
they
found
that
there
was
a
right
of
appeal,
that
they
would
have
issued
a
mandamus
quite
as
readily
as
they
did.
they
recognized,
citing
ex
parte
fahey,
the
reluctance
of
this
court
and
every
other
court
to
grant
a
mandamus,
but
found
that
when
the
state
was
put
in
a
position
where
the
actions
and
the
petition,
the
petition
and
the
actions
resulting
therefrom,
that
is
the
trial
of
the
case
on
removal--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--yes,
sir.
that's
it
exactly.
that
justice
taft
had
to
take
that
into
consideration
before
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
did.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
no,
sir.
it
was...
they
had
reached
the
stage
where
the
petition
had
been
filed.
my
recollection
is
it
was
attacked
in
the
united
states
district
court.
they
filed
a
number
of
petitions,
i
think
that
one
on
a
remand.
the
circuit
court
judge,
judge
soper,
had
said,
okay.
this
is
fine.
now,
at
that
point
the...
maryland
took
the
case
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
on
a
direct
mandamus.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
absolutely,
sir.
absolutely.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
right,
and
particularly
as
it
provided
for
the
appeal.
but
we
did
have
an
appeal.
we
had
to--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--well,
i
thought
so;
yes,
sir.
i
have
some
question,
though.
what
my
point
is,
that
to
reach
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
mandamus
he
had
to
go
down
the
line,
he
had
to
look
down
the
line
and
say,
look,
the
state,
when
we're
all
finished
with
this
case,
has
no
right
of
appeal.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
by
the
united
states
at
the...
1907.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
he
never
went
into
it.
he
just
made
it
as
a
flat
statement.
he
didn't
go
into
the
maryland
law
as
such.
he
simply
made
it
as
a
flat
statement.
he
said,
they
have
no
right
to
sue
under
writ
of
error.
they
have
no
right
of
appeal,
the
state,
in
this
forum,
in
this
federal
forum.
they
never
would
have
taken
it.
now,
i
have
read
hetrick,
and
hetrick...
i
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
a
petition
for
rehearing,
or
en
banc,
and
so
forth,
but
hetrick
is
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
because
it
says
in
that
particular
case,
once
again,
what
one
the
underline,
the
united
states,
had
a
right
either
under
18
u.s.c.
3731
or
28
u.s.c.
1291,
for
the
purposes
of
appeal.
and
i
think
the
trap
that
that
case
fell
into
was
that,
it
said,
look,
congress
has
given
us
this
section
3731,
where
it
says
the
provisions
of
this
section...
that
would
be
3731...
provide
a
right
of
appeal,
and
that
that
right
shall
be
liberally
construed.
well,
looking
at
that
statute,
the
9th
circuit
immediately
leaped
upon
that
language
and
said,
gee,
this
is
wonderful.
now,
all
appellate
rights
are
to
be
liberally
construed.
which
i
don't
believe
is
the
case.
i
don't
believe
that
either
congress
or
this
court
has
made
the
statement
that
the
provisions
of
3731
apply
to
anyone
but
the
united
states
and
its
rights
to
appeal.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
no
question,
sir;
no
question.
now,
in
soper,
as
far
as
mandamus
is
concerned,
counsel
has
suggested
that
on
the
principles
of
comity,
federalism,
and
so
forth;
that
this
court
should
issue
a
writ
of,
or
treat
it
in
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
mandamus,
apart
from
the
holdings
in
soper
and
fahey,
where
great
caution
is
given
to
this
court
issuing
writs
of
mandamus.
i'd
like
the
court,
if
it
would
please,
to
consider
its
own
rules
as
applies
to
mandamus.
and
the
necessities
for
a
petition,
the
language
in
that
rule,
the
circumstances
must
be
exceptional,
and
matters
of
the
like.
that
is
simply
a
repetition
of
the
language
that
has
come
to
us
through
the
arizona
statutes
and
that's
all
been
codified
now
in
a
section
under
our
appeals
which
we
call
"special
actions".
again,
too,
when
we
are
examining
mandamus,
as
i
understand
mandamus
and
as
i
believe
the
rules
of
this
court
portray
mandamus,
we
are
not
discussing
review
of
error.
what
we
are
discussing
are
such
matters
as
abuse
of
discretion,
lack
of
jurisdiction,
acting
without
legal
authority,
and
things
of
that
sort,
which
are
of
such
a
nature
as
they
can't
be
treated,
or
the
pressing
thing,
the
appeal
does
not
give
an
end
to
a
speedy
claim
remedy
at
law.
and,
further,
that
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
must
not
be...
excuse
me,
the
reviewing
court,
in
looking
at
the
actions
in
the
trial
court,
must
not
be,
is
it
right?
is
it
wrong?
,
legally,
but
in
exercising
his
jurisdiction
did
this
judge
go
to
that
extreme
where
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
use
this
very
precious,
extraordinary
right
to
step
in
and
act.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
sir,
we're
speaking
now
of
the
united
states.
this
was
a
state
court.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
and
it
was
the
united
states
v.
xyz
or
something?
if,
if--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--my
reading
of
the
case
is,
if
there
was
no
jeopardy
involved,
that
the
matter
did
not
involve
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
then
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
could
examine
it
as
an
ordinary
review
under
wilson
or
under
rojas,
which
is
a
9th
circuit
decision
cited
by
counsel
in
his
brief.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
sir,
i
thought
his
question
went
to
the
united
states
trying
the
case,
not
the
state
court?
mr.
james
d.
whitney
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
no.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
i
think
justice
rehnquist
was
saying,
let's
turn
this
around
and
put
the
whole
thing
in
the
nature
of
a
federal
prosecution,
where
you
have
a
verdict
of
guilty,
the
united
states
stepping...
the
u.s.
district
court
judge
stepping
into
the
case
and
examining
it,
and
entering
then
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
i
think
justice
rehnquist's
question
then
was,
do
you
feel
it
would
be
appealable?
my
response
to
him
was,
and
i'd
just
as
soon
not
make
it,
but
my
response
to
him
is
that
probably
under
united
states
v.
wilson
and
the
united
states
v.
rojas,
which
is
a
9th
circuit
decision,
in
the
absence
of
jeopardy
that
there
would
be
an
appeal.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
we
did,
sir.
we
did.
it
was
dismissed
once;
the
appeal
was
dismissed
once
on
the
basis
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
no,
sir.
double
jeopardy
is
not
an
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
i
believe
that
would
be
the
order
in
that.
i
would
urge
that
this
court
not--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--well,
i
was
going
to
say,
not
make
the
decision
that...
well,
you
know,
here
it
is,
we
can
treat
it
as
mandamus.
we
feel
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
you
know,
go
on
back
and
hear
the
motions--
mr.
james
d.
whitney
--what
i
would
prefer,
sir,
is
that
the
court
be
told
to
examine
its
mandamus.
because
we
are
four
years
down
the
road
now,
and
i
may
have
certain
defenses
to
that.
mr.
james
d.
whitney
that's
all
i
have,
gentlemen,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
