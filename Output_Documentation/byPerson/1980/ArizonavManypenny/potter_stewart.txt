the
removal
statute
is
a
fairly
old
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
of
course,
even
after
it
was
revived,
as
of
that
time
there
was
no
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
for
anybody,
was
there?
justice
stewart
i
mean,
in
a
federal?
justice
stewart
right,
for
either.
in
a
capital
case
there
was
no
right
to
appeal
in
the
federal
courts
before
1907,
was
there?
justice
stewart
well,
somehow
or
other
the
tennessee
v.
davis
got
to
this
court,
so
somebody
must
have
appealed
it.
justice
stewart
by
what
sort
of
procedure?
justice
stewart
i
see.
justice
stewart
i
don't
know
either.
justice
stewart
so
whether
it's
substantive
or
procedural,
in
your
plan
arizona
wins.
that's
your
theory?
justice
stewart
we'll
never
get
to
the
second
question
if
we
decide
against
you
on
the
first,
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
in
any
event
we
did
grant
certiorari
on
both
issues?
justice
stewart
and
what
chief
justice
taft
had
to
say
is
just,
it
was
self-evident
back
in
1925,
that
there
was
no
right
of
an
appeal
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
stewart
and
he
was
talking
about
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
that
court
as
final.
well,
a
judgment
of
acquittal
is
final
in
any
court,
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
i
thought
justice
rehnquist's
question
was,
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
and
the
government
did
appeal,
should
the
court
of
appeals
simply
dismiss
the
appeal
if
it
found
that
there
was
double
jeopardy?
however,
whatever
his
question
was,
now
that
i've
interrupted
you,
do
you
make
any
double
jeopardy
claim
in
this
case?
justice
stewart
is
that
here?
justice
stewart
so,
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
for
this
court
to
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
in
the
ground
that
it
gave,
that
there
was
no
appeal
allowed
whatsoever
by
arizona,
and
then
to
remand
the
case
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
appealability
under
the
other
ground
rules,
including
double
jeopardy.
and
if
it
found
that
the
appeal
was
well
taken,
then
to
consider
the
substantive
question,
which
is
question
two.
justice
stewart
i
know;
you're
on
the
other
side.
justice
stewart
well,
again,
maybe
if
your
brother
here
on
the
other
side
is
correct
on
his
alternative
argument,
it
was
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
treat
it
as
mandamus
and
it's
up
to
us
to
tell
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
so.
justice
stewart
yes;
you
may.
justice
stewart
but
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
refusal
of
a
federal
district
court
to
remand
or
remove
case
back
to
the
state,
was
there?
