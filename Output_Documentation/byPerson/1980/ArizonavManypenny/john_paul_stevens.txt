justice
stevens
mr.
smith,
may
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second?
you
cited
the
tennessee
v.
williams.
that
would
be--
justice
stevens
--and
then
it
had...
that
was
in
1880,
was
it?
justice
stevens
at
that
time
that
case
was
decided,
there
was
removal
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
court
and
is
it
your
view
that
there
was
an
appeal
allowable
at
that
time?
justice
stevens
even
if
there
was
no
right
of
appeal
to
the
united
states
in
a
federal
prosecution?
justice
stevens
well,
just
so
i
have
your
argument...
if
it's
authorized
under
3731,
you
are
arguing
that
the
state
of
arizona
should
be
treated
as
3731?
justice
stevens
but
if
you
take
that
view,
then
3731
really
wasn't
necessary
for
the
united
states
to
have
the
right
to
appeal.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
prior
decisions,
it
said
that
1291
doesn't
cover
appeals
by
the
prosecution?
justice
stevens
if
that's
the
case,
how
can
we
now
read
1291
to
allow
appeals
when
the
state
of
arizona
is
the
prosecutor?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
you're
still
relying
on
3731
as
a
necessary
part
of
your
1291
argument?
justice
stevens
mr.
smith,
let
me
go
back
to
maryland.
i
may
have
missed
something,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
was
saying
that
there
can
be
no
appeal
by
the
state
of
maryland
after
the
trial
is
over
if
maryland
loses
it?
justice
stevens
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
stevens
of
course,
it's
still
not
a
complete
answer
if
there
would
have
been
an
appeal
from
some
kinds
of
acquittals.
then
it
might
have
been
that
mandamus
would
have
been
appropriate,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
what
the
case
holds
is...
and
also,
there's
no
possibility
of
a
posttrial
appeal.
that
never
did--
justice
stevens
--well,
if
it
didn't
say
that,
why
was
mandamus
necessarily
appropriate
then?
because
then,
at
the
very
end
of
the
proceeding,
it
might
have
theoretically
been
possible
to
review
the
removal
order.
justice
stevens
no,
but
there
could
have
been
an
order
of
say,
of
conviction,
and
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
at
that
point
there
conceivably
could
have
been
review
of
the
removal
order.
