justice
white
but
it
also
said
that
state
law
governed
the
substantive
aspects?
justice
white
and
is
it
your
position
that
appealability
is
a
substantive
matter,
to
be
controlled
by
state
law?
justice
white
it
makes
quite
a
bit
of
difference
what
position
you
take,
i
suppose.
i
suppose
the
result
of
the
united
states
position
is
that
arizona
could
appeal
in
a
removed
case
even
if
it
couldn't
appeal
in
its
own
courts.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
is
that
your
position?
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
have
to...
you
just
can't
say,
reverse,
or
append,
at
the
bottom.
you
have
to
say,
why.
so
what
is
your
theory
of
appealability?
justice
white
do
you
rely
on
1291,
or?
justice
white
then
you
would
apparently
say
that
arizona
could
appeal
under
that
statute
even
if
it
couldn't
appeal
in
its
own
courts?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
we
decide
on
that
ground,
why
then
we
are
deciding
that
arizona
could
appeal
in
a
federal
court,
even
if
it
couldn't
in
its
state
court.
but
if
you
relied
on
1291
and
said
state
law
determines
it?
justice
white
then
you're
saying
that
the
state
is
just
a
party
that
can
appeal?
justice
white
wholly
aside
from
whether
it
could
appeal
in
its
own
courts?
justice
white
well,
why
are
you
citing
tennessee
then?
justice
white
so
you
don't
really
care
about
tennessee's
holding
that
state
substantive
law
governs?
it's
the
other
aspect
of
it
that
the
federal
system
has
all
you
need
to
try
the
case?
well,
as
i
understood
your
argument,
mr.
smith,
it
was
this,
that
you
don't
need,
and
we
don't
need
to
decide
whether
this
is
procedural
or
substantive
under
tennessee
v.
davis,
since
arizona
has
a
right
of
appeal
under
state
law,
in
any
event,
and
you
say
that
the
federal
statute
gives
arizona
a
right
of
appeal
under
federal
law,
in
any
event?
justice
white
and
not
be
permitted
to
appeal
except
where
3731
would
permit
the
united
states
to
appeal?
justice
white
or
the
absence
of
such
rights
as
they
do
not
have?
justice
white
well,
mr.
whitney,
i
understand
your
colleague
to
take
the
position
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
appeal
in
the
federal
courts,
whether
they
have
the
right
to
appeal
in
the
state
courts
or
not.
justice
white
well,
if
he's
right
about
that,
we
needn't
get
into
state
law.
justice
white
i
know
he
submits--
justice
white
--and
several
times
he
submits
that
the
state
shouldn't
lose
its
right
to
appeal
by
a
removal.
justice
white
but
the
grounds
that
he
urges,
independent
of
whether
there's
a
right
to
appeal
in
the
state
courts
or
not.
