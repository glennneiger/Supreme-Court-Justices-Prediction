justice
jr.
do
you
say
that
held
that
subdivision
5
did
not
include
appeals
from
judgments
of
acquittal?
justice
jr.
your
point
is
that
in
soper
mandamus
would
not
have
issued
if
there
was
an
appeal?
justice
jr.
that
was
also
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
was
it?
justice
jr.
did
you
say
there
was
a
statute
providing
for
an
appeal
by
the
united
states?
justice
jr.
and
your
suggestion
is
that,
implicitly,
at
least,
chief
justice
taft
said
that
that
was
not
available
to
support
an
appeal,
therefore
there
was
no
right
of
appeal,
therefore
it
had
to
be
mandamus?
justice
jr.
what
about
state
v.
hunt,
mr.
smith?
