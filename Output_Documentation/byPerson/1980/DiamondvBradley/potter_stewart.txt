justice
stewart
well,
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
dissenting
opinions,
as
i
was
taught
in
law
school,
are
subversive
literature;
nothing
more
or
less.
but
that
much
is
true,
that
novelty
is
covered
by
another
section
of
the
patent
laws.
justice
stewart
well,
if
the
inventor
came
in,
or
the
applicant
came
in
and
said,
i've
invented
vacuum,
what
happens
when
there's
a
vacuum?
justice
stewart
that
would
not
be
patentable,
any
more
than
an
applicant
who
came
in
and
said,
i've
invented
the
law
of
gravity.
that's
not
patentable.
that
much
is
conceded,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
it
was
a
question.
if
an
applicant
came
in
and
said,
my
total
machine
depends
upon
my
invention
of
a
vacuum.
now,
that
would
not
be
patentable,
would
it?
justice
stewart
right;
correct.
justice
stewart
exactly.
justice
stewart
when
a
machine
is
a
combination
of
elements,
the
mere
fact
that
one
element
is
the
law
of
gravity
or
the
operation
of
the
law
of
gravity
does
not
make
the
machine
unpatentable
per
se,
does
not
make
a
machine
ineligible
under
101.
that's
your
point.
justice
stewart
right.
but
that...
if
you're
looking
at
it
as
a
whole,
as
a
combination
one
element
being
an
unpatentable
element,
there
nevertheless
in
the
other
element
must
exist
some
novelty.
justice
stewart
i
didn't
say
that.
but
even
though
having
an
unpatentable
element
in
it
doesn't
disqualify,
nevertheless
you
have
to
have...
the
novelty
in
the
unpatentable
element
won't
provide
the
novelty
necessary
for
the
patent.
you
have
to
have
the
novelty
in
the
other
element,
don't
you?
justice
stewart
well,
then
you
should
have...
why
didn't
you
answer
my
question
and
say,
yes,
the
novelty
must
exist
in
something
besides
the
unpatentable
element?
you
just
said
it
does.
justice
stewart
well,
all
right.
justice
stewart
but
the
novelty
cannot
be,
cannot
solely
exist
in
the
unpatentable
element.
justice
stewart
i
understand
that.
mr.
prasinos,
supposing...
you
emphasize
the
difference
between
a
machine
and
a
process,
as
i
understand
you?
