mr.
nicholas
prasinos
mr.
justice
brennan,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
a
narrow
question
of
statutory
interpretation
under
35
u.s.c.
101.
more
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
respondents'
invention
is
a
machine
as
that
term
is
used
under
35
u.s.c.
101.
if
it
is,
your
honors,
then
the
invention
is
eligible
to
be
considered
by
the
united
states
patent
and
trademark
office
under
the
other
conditions
of
patentability
of
35
u.s.c.--
your
honors,
briefly
then,
the
question
is
eligibility,
not
patentability.
i
would
like
to
state
up
front,
your
honors,
that
this
is
a
machine
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
it
is
disclosed
as
a
machine,
it
is
claimed
it
is
a
machine,
and
it
is
a
machine.
even
the
commissioner
admitted
before
the
ccpa
that
it
is
a
machine,
and
i
might
read
the
exact
words.
in
reply
to
a
question
of
one
of
the
justices
which
was,
"do
you
agree
with
the
applicant
that
he
is
claiming
a
machine
where
it
starts
out
in
multiprogram
computer
systems?
"
the
answer
was,
"i
suppose
it
is
a
machine.
"
"it
is
an
apparatus
of
some
sort.
"
"yes,
your
honor.
"
your
honors,
i
would
also
like
to
state
up
front
that
this
is
not
a
computer
program.
computer
programs
are
generally
written
by
programmers.
they
are
sold
separate
and
apart.
they
utilize
conventional
computers.
this
invention
utilizes
hardware
which
is
physically
incorporated
into
the
computer
to
make
a
new
computer
machine.
your
honors,
i
might
state
again
that
this
is
one
of
a
series
of
inventions
which
collectively
define
the
level
64
honeywell
series
computer
which
is
marketed
worldwide
today.
it
was
developed
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
it
involved
hundreds
of
engineers
and
at
a
cost
of
over
$25
million.
the
invention
is
comprised
of
a
hardware
combination
comprising
registers,
hardware
gates,
logic
circuits,
and
memory
elements
which
are
physically
incorporated
into
the
computer
and
permanently
incorporated
into
the
computer.
they
cooperate
with
each
other
and
function
with
each
other
to
substantially
instantaneously
and
automatically
change
the
physical
capabilities
of
this
machine.
in
effect,
what
they
do
is
provide
different
architectures,
different
models,
so
to
speak.
it
instantaneously,
substantially
provides
a
scientific
model
or
a
business
model.
let
me
make
this
absolutely
clear
by
a
familiar
analogy.
recently,
an
automobile
manufacturer--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--that's
a
portion
of
the
computer
machine.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
right.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
yes.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
what
it
does,
that
language
in
the
beginning,
in
the
summary,
was
amended
in
the
very
first
portion,
and
it's
on
the
record
in
here,
where
"model-dependent"
was
stricken
out
and
additional
language
was
written
in
which
in
effect
made
it
clear
that
what
it
did
is
provided
different
independent
models
to
the
computer.
one
way
of
initializing
it
is
just
to
initialize
it
by
actually
having
a
clone
of
its
initial
type
of
model
under
consideration.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
no,
it
is
not.
your
honor,
what
this--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--it
is
a
permanent
part
of
this
computer,
the
level
64
computer
machine,
your
honor.
the
analogy
might
make
this
clear,
your
honor.
recently
an
automobile
manufacturer
introduced
an
automobile
engine
called
the
v-8,
6
&
4.
what
it
is,
it
automatically
substantially
instantaneously
changes
it
to
a
four-cylinder
model,
six-cylinder
model,
eight-cylinder
model
in
response
to
power
requirements.
when
you
need
power,
like
passing
or
going
up
a
hill,
why
it
automatically
changes
it
into
an
eight-cylinder
model.
or
when
it's
idling,
it
changes
to
a
four-cylinder
model.
now,
one
way
that
that
can
be
done
is
you're
going
to
have
some
kind
of
hardware
that
will
sense
the
power
requirements.
some
other
type
of
hardware
that's
going
to
cut
off
the
cylinders
and
its
appurtenant
hardware.
and
still
another
control
element.
now,
this
physical
hardware
is
incorporated
into
that
automobile
engine
and
substantially
and
automatically
changes
and
gives
different
models.
now,
that's
exactly
what
our
machine
does.
it
provides
different
computing
powers,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
the
problem
is
that
this
is
not
software,
your
honor.
that's
where
the
misunderstanding
comes.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
it
is
hardware,
your
honor.
software
is
utilized,
if
i
might
make
that
point
clear,
by
computer
programs.
all
computer
machines,
systems,
are
comprised
of
both
hardware
and
software.
the
hardware
are
the
physical
objects
which,
upon
which
the
circuits
are
fabricated
and
transmit
the
electric
circuits,
electric
signals.
the
software
utilizes
the
hardware
in
order
to
solve
user
problems.
now,
your
honor,
software
are
written
by
programmers
and
they're
generally,
software
are
generally
embodied
in
this.
they
are
shown
on
the
record
on
pages
4
and
5,
and
these
are
typical
software.
you
put
this
in
a
conventional
computer.
these
are
sold
separate
and
apart
from
the
computer.
the
user
then,
who
buys
something
like
this
to
solve
something
like
placing
a
telephone
directory
into
his
computer
or
solving
an
accounting
problem,
your
honor.
now,
your
honor--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--yes,
it
was;
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
what's
that?
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
type
of
software
that
would
do
that.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
basically,
your
honor,
all
machines
have
a
rule
of
action.
therefore,
for
example,
the
rule
of
action
can
be
embodied
in
the
machine
operations.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
no.
but
under
the
precept--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
your
honors,
it's
combination
of
elements
that
are
patentable.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
the
scientific
principle
itself
is
not
patentable.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
it
is
a
discovery,
it
has
always
existed,
and
in
that
form
a
person
that
comes
in
and
says,
i
have
discovered
a
basic,
fundamental
principle
cannot
get
a
patent
on
that.
what
he
can
get
it
is
when
he
clothes
it
with
the
hardware,
the
combination
of
elements.
out
of
the
myriad
of
combinations
that
are
possible--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--that's
right.
in
flook,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
stated
in
essence
that
the
conditions
for
patentability
are
that
it
falls
under
one
of
the
categories
of
35
u.s.c.
101.
two,
it
is
manmade;
three,
it
has
not
always
existed.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
your
honor,
there
is
not
novelty
involved
in
35
u.s.c.
101.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
no,
your
honor.
your
honor,
it's
just
like
lee
de
forest
had
the...
first
of
all,
he
took
fleming's
valve,
which
was
identical
to
lee
de
forest's
arrangement,
and
all
lee
de
forest
inserted
is
a
piece
of
wire
in
between.
now,
that
piece
of
wire,
you
can
say,
may
not
be
patentable,
and
there
was
no
novelty
in
that
piece
of
wire.
however,
when
you
inserted
it
in
there
and
biased
in
a
certain
way,
that
made
those
elements
cooperate
and
function
in
a
manner
never
before
known
and
really
what
it
did
is
introduce
the
whole
electronic
industry.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
it
exists
in
the
combination,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
it
exists
in
the
combination,
not
any
one
element.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
but
novelty
is
not
an
issue
under
35
u.s.c.
1o1,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
yes.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
i
can't
visualize
that
particular
situation,
but
i
would
like
to
say--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
applied.
if
it's
a
manmade
machine
that
has
not
always
existed,
it
certainly
would
be
eligible
for
consideration
under
the
other
statutes
of
novelty
under
102
and
103,
your
honor.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
no;
no,
your
honor.
i
am
not
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
the
distinction
is
that
a
process,
your
honor,
changes
something
to
a
different
state
of
thing.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
yes,
but,
for
example,
a
process,
you
take
steel,
you
take
iron,
you
heat
it
to
a
given
temperature,
you
put
it
in
cold
water,
that
changes
it
to
a
different
state
of
thing.
now,
101
specifically
enumerates
process
and
delineates
process
from
machine.
and
machine
is
a
combination
of
elements.
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
it's
a
series
of
steps,
your
honor,
a
process
is,
for
performing
a...
changing
something
to
a
different
state
of
thing.
your
honors,
if
i
might
now
turn
to
benson
and
flook,
on
which
the
commissioner
so
heavily
relies,
in
flook
a
mathematical
algorithm
was
involved.
it
was
a
discovery
of
something
that
always
existed.
the
mathematical
algorithm
involved
in
flook
was
a
procedure
for
solving
a
given
type
of
mathematical
problem.
hence,
flook
never
discovered
anything
but
a
law
of
nature.
this
court
notes--
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
--what's
that,
sir?
mr.
nicholas
prasinos
i
was
not
here,
your
honor.
this
court
noted
that
the
underlying
notion
is
that
a
scientific
principle
such
as
that
expressed
in
flook
reveals
a
relationship
that
has
always
existed.
thus,
it
was
not
the
type
of
subject
matter
that
the
patent
laws
were
enacted
to
protect.
yet,
this
court
never
enunciated
a
two-step
rule,
it
is
submitted,
your
honors.
they
merely
recognized
that
the
process
of
flook
was
old.
the
commissioner
here
is
advocating
a
two-step
rule
whereby
you
would
lock
at
an
invention
and
see
what
the
fundamental
law
of
nature
is
like,
for
example,
in
edison's
light
bulb.
then
you
would
say,
that's
in
the
prior
art.
now,
are
there
other
novel
features?
let
us
now
look
at
that
bulb;
that's
old.
let's
look
at
the
incandescent
filament;
that's
old.
the
vacuum
technology
is
old.
therefore
there
is
nothing
new.
certainly
flook
was
not
all
about
that,
your
honor.
your
honors,
it
is
only
by
this
mistaken
and
somewhat
irrational
approach
that
the
commissioner
can
even
lay
claim
that
there
is
a
program
involved.
this
court
need
not
decide
any
broad
policy
questions
regarding
computer
programs.
there
is
no
computer
program
involved.
as
this
court
articulated,
such
policy
decisions
are
to
be
reserved
and
addressed
by
congress.
your
honors,
it
is
submitted
that
the
commissioner
is
seeking
a
per
se
rule
to
have
for
his
own
administrative
convenience,
to
have
a
program
per
se
held
as
unpatentable
subject
matter.
there
is
no
program
here.
he
states
that
it
puts
him
in
a
difficult
position
to
examine
such
programs.
he
has
examined
this
invention,
as
the
record
below
shows.
your
honors,
this
is
a
manmade
machine
which
has
never
existed.
the
commissioner
has
admitted
this.
it
fully
complies
with
the
conditions
and
precepts
set
out
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
of
101,
including
benson,
flook
and
chakrabarty.
holding
and
finding
that
this
invention
is
patentable
subject
matter
under
35
u.s.c.
101
would
deprive
the
public
of
no
rights
which
it
has
heretofore
existed.
your
honors,
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
35
u.s.c.
101
requires
that
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
