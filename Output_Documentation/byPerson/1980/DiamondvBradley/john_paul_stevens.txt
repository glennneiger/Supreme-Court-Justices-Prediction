justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
i
didn't
understand
the
respondent
to
ask
us
to
reexamine
flook.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
is
it
that
the
remainder
of
the
application
is
to
be
examined
to
determine
whether
there
is
novelty
or
to
determine
whether
anything
else
novel
is
claimed?
justice
stevens
and
that's
why
the
dissent...
that's
a
point
the
dissent
missed
in
flook,
isn't
it?
and
in
flook
it
was
conceded
the
only
novel
thing
was
the
formula.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
you
do
then
concede
that
the
patent
claims
the
words
"data
structure"
describe
a
machine?
justice
stevens
do
the
words
"data
structure"
have
any
recognized
meaning?
there
are
all
sorts
of
glossaries
in
the
briefs
and
all,
and
this
is
one
term,
a
rather
important
term,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
included
in
any
of
the
glossaries.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
with
respect
to
your
third,
your
response
to
the
third
arguable
distinction
of
flook,
namely,
that
flook
should
not
be
limited
merely
to
mathematical
formulas
produced
by
some
software,
is
it
your
view
of
the
patent
claim
which
is
in
judge
rich's
opinion...
it
describes
four
separate
means
of
describing
this
data
structure...
that
that
description
of
a
first,
second,
third,
and
fourth
means
is
in
effect
a
description
of
a
computer
software
program,
and
that
that
is
what
they're
seeking
to
patent?
i
must
confess
i
have
some
difficulty
understanding
the
claim
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
in
your
view
of
the
case
the
program
is
claimed
by
the
patent.
justice
stevens
before
you
get
to
your
analysis,
mr.
prasinos,
because
i
have
trouble
getting
into
analogies,
judge
rich
described
the
two
advantages
of
your...
your
machine
relates
to,
what
do
you
call
it,
reinitializing
the--
justice
stevens
--the
two
difficulties
before,
as
i
understand
it,
were
that
sometimes
you
have
to
pull
an
awful
lot
of
switches
and
it's
time-consuming
when
you
void
it--
justice
stevens
--or
secondly,
you
have
to
use
software
that
is
what
they
say,
model-dependent.
justice
stevens
as
i
understood
it,
that
meant
that
the
problem
was
you
could
only
use
that
software
for
one
kind
of
model.
justice
stevens
now,
as
i
understand
it,
your
description
of
this
invention,
it
describes
hardware
that
only
fits
in
one
model.
or
is
the
hardware
transferable
to
different
kinds
of
models?
justice
stevens
is
the
invention
claimed
in
this
patent
model-dependent?
model-dependent
as
judge
rich
used
the
term
in
the
second
page
of
his
opinion?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
it's
not
a
permanent
part
of
any
given
model
of
the
machine?
justice
stevens
but
that's
for
a
given
machine,
and
as
i
understand
the
prior
art,
if
you
had
the
right
software
for
a
particular
machine,
you
could
have
done
that
before
this
invention.
justice
stevens
but
how
is
it
an
advance
over
the
software,
is
what
i
don't
understand?
justice
stevens
was
there
software
available
before
your
invention
for
reinitializing
particular
models
of
machines?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
the
kind
of
software
that
would
be
analogous
to
your
invention,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
supposing
a
patent
application
said
in
substance
as
follows,
we
have
a
new
machine.
the
thing
that's
new
about
it
is
that
it
will
use
the
formula
described
in
the
flook
case.
that's
the
only
thing
that's
new.
we've
got
a
machine
that
uses
that
formula
and
all
the
other
elements
are
well
known.
would
the
fact
that
it
was
a
machine
take
it
out
of
the
flook
case?
justice
stevens
say
that
had
not
been
a
process
claim
but
they'd
said,
we
have
a
computer
programmed
to
solve
this
equation,
updating
our
alarm
limits
and
all
that,
and
the
only
thing
new
about
it
is
it
has
this
particular
program
on
the
machine,
and
we're
asking
for
a
patent
on
the
machine
as
opposed
to
the
process.
justice
stevens
you'd
say
that
if
the
precise
invention
described
in
the
parker
v.
flook
case
had
been
described
in
terms
of
a
machine
which
will
do
these
things
instead
of
a
process,
then
it
would
have
been
patentable
subject
matter?
justice
stevens
so
then
the
distinction
between
a
machine
and
a
process
can't
be
critical?
justice
stevens
well,
a
machine
can
do
that
too.
justice
stevens
well,
process
can
be
a
combination
of
elements.
