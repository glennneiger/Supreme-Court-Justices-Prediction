well,
is
that
the
same,
mr.
wallace...
is
this
patent
only
on
the
firmware
module?
or
is
it
on
the
whole--
justice
jr.
--switching
operation
from
main
memory
to
switchback
registers?
justice
jr.
is
that
what
the
patent
covers?
justice
jr.
not
merely
the
firmware
module?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

we'll
resume
there

o'clock,
mr.

[recess.]
you
may
resume,
mr.
wallace,
if
you're
ready.
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
wallace,
this
gets
back,
i
guess,
to
the
question
i
asked
you,
wasn't
it,
earlier?
you
don't
regard
this
patent
as
simply
on
the
firmware
module.
it's
broader
than
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
prasinos.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
further,
mr.
wallace?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
