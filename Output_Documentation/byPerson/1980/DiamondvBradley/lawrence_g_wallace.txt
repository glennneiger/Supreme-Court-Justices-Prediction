mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
justice
brennan
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
and
the
next
case
to
be
heard
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
reversed
the
rejection
by
the
patent
office,
including
the
patent
office
board
of
appeals,
of
the
patent
claims
at
issue.
we
sought
review
because
we
believe
that
the
cases
are
controlled
by
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
101
of
the
patent
act,
in
parker
v.
flook,
which
was
decided
in
the
1977
term,
and
because
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals'
rejection
of
that
interpretation
of
the
patent
act
in
favor
of
a
different
explanation
of
the
result
reached
by
the
court
in
flook
has
put
the
patent
office
in
an
obviously
difficult
position
with
respect
to
the
thousands
of
pending
patent
applications
involving
computer
programming.
before
getting
into
the
specifics
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
say,
up
front,
that
we
do
not
regard
the
interpretation
of
section
101
of
the
patent
code
adopted
in
flook
to
be
an
appropriate
subject
for
reexamination
by
the
court
at
this
time.
this
is
a
statutory
interpretation,
authoritatively
reached
by
this
court.
it's
a
matter
that
congress
can
change
if
it
sees
fit
to
do
so,
and
indeed
there
has
been
significant
congressional
activity
in
this
area
since
the
court's
decision.
the
patent
office,
which
is
the
administrative
agency
directly
affected,
has
been
following
this
interpretation
for
a
matter
of
more
than
two
years
now.
and
ordinarily
no
member
of
the
court
would
reexamine
an
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
subject
to
congressional
change
after
it
has
been
authoritatively
decided
by
a
majority
of
the
court.
the
fact
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
persisted
in
differing
with
this
interpretation
is
not,
in
our
view...
and
i
say
this
with
all
respect
to
that
court...
is
not
in
our
view
a
reason
for
a
different
approach
with
respect
to
the
stability
of
a
statutory
precedent
in
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
has
differed
with
the
interpretation
of
section
101
that
this
court
adopted
in
flook.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
a
different
explanation
for
the
result
in
flook,
which
brings
about--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--different
from
ours,
and
different--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
this
is
fairly
debatable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
written
at
some
length
about
why
it
thought
that
the
court's
reading
of
section
101
in
flook
was
erroneous.
it's
not
a
difference
that
is
without
basis
on
the
pages
of
their
opinions.
i
believe
the
court
is
familiar
with
this
and
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point.
i
do
want
to
make
the
basic
point
that
if
as
we
view
the
matter
this
would
not
be
an
appropriate
subject
for
reexamination
in
the
absence
of
this
difference.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
court
below
has
differed
with
this
interpretation
should
make
the
matter
more
subject
to
reexamination.
i
think
that
that
would
send
a
message
to
the
lower
courts
that
would
be
unfortunate
for
consistency
in
the
administration
of
the
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
mr.
justice.
as
i
said,
the
court
has
written
on
that
meaning
in
flook
and
congress
is
now
actively
considering
what
changes
if
any
to
make
in
the
patent
or
copyright
laws,
and
i'll
get
into
the
details
of
that
subsequently.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
believe
that
has
been
put
to
the
court.
no
one
has
asked
the
court
to
overrule
flook.
the
arguments
that
are
being
made
are,
it
seems
to
me,
inconsistent
with
the
ratio
decidendi
of
flook,
and
that
is
what
i
refer
to
as
the
court's
interpretation
of
section
101.
nobody
is
asking
that
the
holding
be
overruled.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
been
very
meticulous
in
following
that
holding,
but
based
on
a
different
explanation
from
what
i
regard,
what
we
have
regarded
as
the
ratio
decidendi
of
flook
in
the
interpretation
of
section
101
of
the
patent
laws.
now,
in
this
case,
to
get
into
the
specifics
of
this
case,
the
board
of
appeals,
as
we
understand
flook,
applied
the
flook
test
to
the
claims
at
issue
and
examined
the
claims
at
issue
in
light
of
the
rationale
adopted
by
this
court
in
flook.
and
under
flook,
as
the
board
of
appeals
viewed
this,
if
the
claims
recite
a
scientific
principle,
idea,
concept,
formula,
or
phenomenon
of
nature,
then
that
basic
tool
of
scientific
and
technological
work,
as
the
court
called
it
in
the
benson
case,
should
be
assumed
to
be
within
the
prior
art.
and
then,
what
remains
must
be
analyzed
to
determine
whether
it
is
novel
under
flook's
reading
of
the
morse
case
and
others.
if
one
prefers
one
can
say,
then
the
claims
as
a
whole
should
be
examined,
assuming
that
scientific
principle,
formula,
et
cetera,
to
be
already
known.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
precisely
the
position
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
flook.
novelty
is
covered--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--by
section
102
of
the
patent
code.
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
certainly
is.
section
101
also
uses
the
word
"new",
however.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
latter
formulation
is
the
more
accurate
one,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
true.
it
was
conceded
in
flook.
in
this
case,
it
is
being
contested
by
the
respondent
in
this
court.
however,
whether
contested
or
conceded,
the
board
of
appeals,
i
think
quite
rightly,
thought
it
was
its
duty
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
novelty
thing
claimed
other
than
in
what
must
be
assumed
under
flook
to
be
within
the
prior
art.
and
that
determination
was
made
in
this
case
and
the
conclusion
was
that
the
only
contribution,
as
the
board
put
it,
the
only
novelty
inhered
in
the
program,
the
computer
program,
that
was
a
part
of
these
claims.
and,
as
we
detail
in
our
briefs
and
our
reply
briefs,
there
was
an
examination
here
of
the
prior
art
cited
by
the
respondent
itself
before
the
patent
office,
a
patent
that
had
been
issued
to
coulter
and
an
application
by
carre,
in
both
of
which
all
of
the
diagrams
save
the
ones
at
the
very
end
were
reproduced
by
the
respondent
as
part
of
their
claim.
the
coulter
patent,
indeed,
is
an
example
of
the
kind
of
patent
that
has
been
issued
on
computer
hardware.
some
of
the
briefs
suggest
that
our
position
is
that
such
patents
can't
be
issued,
but
that
in
itself
is
an
example
of
such
patents
that
are
valid
and
can
be
issued.
and,
in
analyzing
these
in
detail,
it
was
seen
that
all
that
was
left
as
a
contribution
was
the
program,
although
respondents
contend
otherwise
before
this
court.
i
think
this
is
adequately
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief.
in
light
of
those
findings,
there
were
three
possible
bases
as
we
see
the
case,
for
distinguishing
of
flook
and
for
reaching
a
different
result
from
flook.
and
all
three
of
those
are,
in
our
view,
unpersuasive.
the
first
is
that
this
application
involved
a
machine
claim
rather
than
a
process
claim
such
as
was
involved
in
the
flook
case.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
mention
about
that
difference
is
a
passage
from
an
opinion
by
judge
rich
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
it
happens
to
be
a
dissenting
opinion
but
it's
not
dissenting
on
this
particular
point.
it's
in
a
case
called
545
f.
2d,
and
at
page
160
he
points
out
in
his
opinion,
based
on
the
experience
of
that
court
and
of
the
patent
office:
"given
an
invention
which
is
in
essence
a
new
program
for
a
general
purpose
digital
computer,
a
competent
patent
draftsman
can
readily
define
the
invention
as
either
a
process
or
a
machine
or
both.
"
"this
has
been
demonstrated
time
and
again
by
the
computer
program
cases
which
have
come
to
this
court.
"
we
have
another
similar
quotation
from
the
same
judge
in
our
brief,
on
page
22.
this
is
not,
as
we
regard
it,
a
difference
of
substance
in
the
claim
or
a
difference
of
inventive
contribution,
but
basically
a
difference
in
the
draftsmanship
of
the
application.
and
indeed
the
fact
that
the
application
is
put
as
a
machine
claim
rather
than
a
process
claim,
if
anything
raises
possible
additional
impediments
to
the
granting
of
the
application
because
of
the
cases
we've
collected
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
in
which
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
a
claim
describing
the
inherent
operation
of
a
known
machine
is
not
statutory
subject
matter.
obviously,
whether
the
machine
was
capable
of
executing
the
program
that
respondents
have
devised
was
predetermined
by
the
design
of
the
machine
itself,
and
the
inventor
of
that
machine
should
hardly
be
excluded
under
the
patent
laws
from
uses
of
the
machine
which
were
inherent
in
the
operation
that
he
built
into
the
machine,
which
is
really
what's
involved
here.
as
we
further
point
out,
there
is
also
the
problem
that
allowing
this
as
a
new
machine
claim
would
extend
the
life
of
the
patent
on
the
machine
through
a
new
machine
claim
that
essentially
just
describes
one
of
the
inherent
operations
of
the
machine.
this
is
not
a
matter
that's
wholly
irrelevant
to
what
the
respondents
have...
put
into
the
case
in
this
court,
because
page
1
of
respondents'
brief
starts
off,
in
their
statement
under
the
heading,
"what
the
invention
is":
"the
respondents'
invention
is
one
of
a
series
of
inventions
which
collectively
define
an
entirely
new
computer
machine
which
is
now
being
commercially
marketed
worldwide
as
the
honeywell
series
60,
level
64
computer.
"
in
essence
they're
saying
that
the
life
of
the
of
the
coulter
patent
is
extended
by
this
additional
machine
patent
if
it
were
to
be
granted.
and
we
have
also
addressed
in
our
reply
brief
the
possibility
of
a
doctrine
of
transitory
novelty
where
a
particular
selection
put
into
a
player
piano
or
a
particular
letter
or
a
memorandum
inserted
into
a
word
processor
that
hasn't
been
in
the
word
processor
before...
you
know,
those
machines
that
are
replacing
typewriters
in
offices...
would
transform
the
machine
for
the
moment
into
a
new
machine.
this
has
never
been
a
doctrine
recognized
under
the
patent
law
and
would
have
the
same
drawbacks,
the
same
inconsistencies
of
established
law
as
i
have
described.
a
second
possible
basis
for
distinguishing
flook,
equally
unpersuasive
in
our
view,
is
that
the
claim
here
involves
firmware,
so-called,
rather
than
software.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
claim
is
on
the
whole
machine,
using
the
firmware,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--through
this
method,
through
the
described
method,
and
the
contribution--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
what
the
claim
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
merely
the
firmware
but
the
claim
is
on
the
whole
machine
and
as
fixed
up
with
this
firmware
to
transfer
the
information
within
the
existing
computer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
the
previous
patent
would
necessarily
preclude
a
patent
there,
because
you're
dealing
with
a
different
machine.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
precluded
under
101
in
that
instance.
it
might
be
that
the
only,
that
there'd
be
a
lack
of
novelty
because
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--probably
under
another
section.
i
haven't
really
given
thought
to
that
particular
question,
but
that
isn't
what's
involved
here.
here
we
have
the
same
hardware
and
the
same
arrangement
of
hardware
and
making
use
of
one
of
the
inherent
uses
for
which
it
was
designed
and
of
which
it's
capable.
that's
quite
a
different
question
from
yours,
it
seems
to
us.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
the
argument
being
made
by
the
respondents.
at
one
point,
before
the
ccpa,
the
government
said
that
the
claims
do,
are
written
in
a
way
to
describe
a
machine.
the
claims
are
basically
for
a
process
of
transferring
the
information,
but
they're
written
in
the
form
of
claiming
the
machine,
the
familiar
machine,
the
conventional
machine,
as
a
program
to
perform
this
process.
that's
the
best
i
can
describe
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
of
any
accepted
meaning
for
it.
data
processing
is
the
most
common
use
of
computers.
it's
really
a
more
common
use
than
solving
mathematical
problems
of
the
kind
that
was
involved
in
flook.
the
examples
given
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
are
typical
of
that,
reproducing
a
page
of
the
milwaukee
phone
book
or
a
court
opinion.
this
is
data
processing,
and
in
a
sense
a
computer
is
a
data
structure.
i
don't
know
that
anything
more
than
that
is
meant
by
it.
now,
the
fact
that
the
claims
here
involve
firmware
rather
than
software
seem
to
us
of
no
legal
significance.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
itself
said
that
firmware
may
be
likened
to
software.
all
that
is
really
involved
here
is
a
microprogram
that
fits
into
the
control
unit
rather
than
the
kind
of
program
that
fits
into
the
main
memory
storage,
so
that
then
the
microprogram,
like
an
ordinary
program,
consists
of
a
series
of
sequential
steps
to
be
carried
out
through
the
ordinary
mathematical
functioning
of
the
digital
computer;
but
using
them
in
a
microprogram
in
the
control
unit,
that
enables
the
programmer
to
have
a
so-called
macroprogram
in
the
main
memory
and
he
can,
by
throwing
that
one
switch,
or
giving
that
one
instruction,
that
will
set
off
the
series
of
sequential
steps
that
have
been
put
into
the
control
unit
in
the
microprogram.
that's
the
only
difference
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
or
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
be
a
difference
of
legal
significance.
then
the
third
possible
basis
for
distinguishing
flook
and
the
one
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
in
fact
been
relying
on
in
the
post-flook
cases
is
an
attempt
to
limit
the
holding
in
flook
to
computer
programs
designed
to
solve
mathematical
problems.
our
submission
is
that
this
is
basically
an
illusory
distinction
and
indeed
one
that
doesn't
fit
in
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
itself,
in
its
own
cases,
because
a
digital
computer
is
designed
solely
to
perform
mathematical
computations.
any
program
that
makes
use
of
it
is
necessarily
mathematical
in
nature,
regardless
of
whether
it's
designed
ultimately
to
find
the
solution
to
a
mathematical
problem
or
for
the
more
common
purpose
of
data
processing.
and
indeed,
the
skills
and
contribution
required
of
the
deviser
of
the
program
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
program
is
designed
to
solve
a
mathematical
problem
or
to
do
the
data
processing.
the
examples
given
by
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
in
this
case,
reproducing
a
page
of
the
milwaukee
telephone
directory
or
a
particular
court
opinion,
seem
to
us
examples
that
require
less
of
a
contribution,
less
of
an
inventive
contribution
from
a
programmer
than
was
involved
in
flook,
where,
after
all,
a
new
formula
was
devised
to
calculate
the
alarm
limits.
whether
the
particular
inventive
contribution
varies,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
data
processing
to
be
done
or
the
nature
of
the
mathematical
problem
to
be
solved--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
have
stated
why,
in
our
view,
each
of
the
three
possible
bases
for
distinguishing
the
flook
case
is
unpersuasive,
and
those
arguments
are
elaborated
in
our
briefs.
i
just
want
to
briefly
inform
the
court
of
the
legislative
developments
in
this
field,
currently.
on
page
24
of
our
brief
we
refer
to
a
bill
that
was
introduced
last
march
by
representative
kastenmeier,
a
bill
entitled,
"the
computer
software
copyright
act
of
1980.
"
that
bill
since
that
time
has
been
favorably
reported
by
both
the
house
committee
on
government
operations
and
the
house
judiciary
committee,
but
has
not
yet
gone
to
the
house
floor,
although
it
is
anticipated
that
there
will
be
floor
action
with
respect
to
it
during
the
session
right
after
the
elections.
there
has
not
yet
been
activity
in
the
senate,
but
the
significant
thing,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
the
congressional
activity
is
focusing
on
copyright
protection
rather
than
patent
protection,
which
would
protect
the
deviser
of
computer
programs.
arguably,
this
protection
already
exists
under
the
present
copyright
law
and
this
would
just
be
a
clarification.
but
it
would
afford
protection
to
the
deviser
of
programs
against
plagiarism,
against
the
copying
of
the
fruits
of
his
labors,
but
still
would
not
preclude
others,
would
not
exclude
them
from
the
inherent
uses
of
the
machine
if
they
through
their
own
labors
want
to
devise
a
program
to
process
similar
data
in
a
similar
way...
for
instance,
reproducing
the
milwaukee
telephone
directory.
there
may
be
a
basis
for
a
congressional
judgment
if
that
is
a
more
appropriate
form
of
protection.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
our
presentation
in
this
court
we're
not
going
back
to
the
claims
ab
initio,
but
we're
relying
on
the
findings
of
the
board
of
appeals
that
while
the
claims
are
cast
as
a
claim
on
a
machine,
the
only
thing
new
in
the
claims
in
light
of
the
prior
art
is
the
microprogramming
to
be
inserted
into
the
control
unit.
this
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
claims
reproduce
in
detail
and
rely
on
the
prior
art
of
the
coulter
and
carre
applications.
and
we
think
that
is
the
posture
in
which
the
case
comes
to
this
court.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
did
not
disagree
with
the
board's
findings
with
respect
to
where
their
claim
of
novelty
inheres,
and
i
think
it
would
just
be
a
distraction
to
try
to
reanalyze
the
claims
ab
initio.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
claims
are
put
more
broadly,
but
that
is
where
the
novelty
inheres
in
the
claims.
that's
where
the
claim
of
novelty
inheres
under
the
findings
of
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
didn't
differ
with
it,
it
didn't
uphold
that
either.
it
just
said
that
the
board
shouldn't
have
isolated
where
the
claim
of
novelty
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
briefly,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
on
pages
99
through
120,
are
reproduced
the
diagrams
that
accompany
the
application,
and
which
i
think
can
quickly
be
referred
to
to
show
what
it
was
that
was
being
claimed.
the
diagrams
on
pages
99
through
119
were
all
reproductions
of
those
in
the
prior
art
and
in
the
coulter
patent
and
carre
application,
the
coulter
patent
having
been
assigned
to
honeywell,
which
is
also
the
assignee
of
this
claim.
the
ones
claimed
to
be
novel,
the
ones
added,
are
those
on
page
120.
the
ones
up
through
page
119
are
the
same
hardware,
the
same
arrangement
of
hardware.
the
ones
on
120
are
figures
15a,
15b,
and
15c.
on
page
2
of
our
reply
brief,
we
discussed
these
briefly.
respondents
told
the
patent
office
that
figure
15a
illustrated
the
switch
system
base
instruction
whose
"operation
code
is
similar
to
the
operation
code
of
any
instruction.
"
in
other
words,
it's
really
a
conventional
macroprogram
mechanism
by
which
to
activate
the
microprogram
in
the
control
unit
that
is
illustrated
in
figures
15b
and
15c.
those
are
flow
charts
which
the
respondent
stated
disclosed
the
microprogram,
or
can
be
translated
into
the
microprogram.
that
is
the
basis
for
the
board's
finding
that
the
claim
of
novelty
inhered
in
a
microprogram,
and
that
everything
else
was
conventional
in
the
art.
now,
obviously,
process
claims
and
machine
claims
stand
on
equal
footing
under
section
101.
the
mere
fact
that
a
claim
is
phrased
as
one
or
the
other
cannot
be
the
end
of
inquiry
under
flook,
and
i'll
elaborate
further
on
the
meaning
of
flook
in
the
next
case.
