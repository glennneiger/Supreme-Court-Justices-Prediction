justice
rehnquist
yes.
both
courts
are
bound
by
the
meaning
of
congress
in
section
101,
are
they
not?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
"novelty"
covered
by
another
section
of
the
act?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
true.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
under
your
previous
argument
which
you
had
just
left
at
the
time
justice
brennan
asked
you
that
question,
would
an
electric
typewriter
not
be
patentable
because
of
the
existence
of
a
typewriter
that
you
punch
by
keys
under
101?
justice
rehnquist
but
then,
that
would
be
under
another
section.
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
never
been
passed
on,
i
thought?
justice
rehnquist
but
didn't
it
say
that
the
issues
of
novelty
and
obviousness
remain
to
be
considered?
justice
rehnquist
is
there
some
particular
rule
applicable
to
patents
that
pertain
to
the
computer
industry
that
is
different
from
the
rules
that
pertain
to
every
other
kind
of
industry?
justice
rehnquist
what
is
it
in
101
that
the
examiner
can
kind
of
turn
away
at
the
door?
supposing,
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
the
vacuum
cleaner,
somebody
brought
in
a
vacuum
cleaner
and
said,
this
is
a
machine
and
it
does
something
a
lot
better
than
a
broom
could
do
it.
could
the
examiner
say,
it
doesn't
meet
the
101
criterion?
