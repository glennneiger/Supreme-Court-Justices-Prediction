mr.
kramer,
under
the
new
act
will
you
still
have
to
make
the
disclosure
that
you
did
make
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
security
interest
in
the
automobile?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
the
one
you
did
make
in
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
not
a
second
mortgage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
security
interest
requirement
is
not
limited
to
second
mortgages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
significant
interest
in
property
or
interest
in
significant
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
your
point
is...
there's
a
significant
interest
in
the
property,
but
your
point
is,
it's
not...
the
property
is
not
significant,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
insurance
is
rather
a
sort
of...
a
fringe--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
said
earlier,
i
think
you
were
interrupted,
that
only
five
words
would
have
to
be
added
to
this
phrase.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
whether
it's
true
or
not,
is
it
not
true
that
by
just
adding
the
words
"and
insurance
policies",
or
something
like
that,
you
would
have
an
adequate
disclosure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
alop,
do
you
think
the
buyer
reasonably
would
have
expected
to
get
the
premium
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
they
really
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
funds
if
they
are
in
default
on
the
loan,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
who
holds
the
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
copy
to
the
dealer
or
the
finance
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
how
does
the
finance
company
know
that
the
car
is
being
insured,
that
it's
a
contractual
obligation
to
get
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
some
kind
of
the
written
document,
i
assume?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then,
if
there's
a
default,
isn't
it
fairly
clear
that
whatever
money
comes
back
will
be
paid
over
to
the
dealer?
i
mean,
wouldn't
the...
how
could
one
not
expect
that
to
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
he
was
in
default
on
his
loan
he
would
think
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
that,
but
wouldn't
the
buyer
of
the
car
realize
that
that's
why
he's
carrying
the
insurance,
to
protect
the...
his
ability
to
pay
off
the
debt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
think
there's
a
significant
potential
for
misleading
the
buyers
in
this
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
intentional,
potential
for,
do
you
think
the
buyers
are
really
apt
to
be
misled
in
this
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
rather
unlikely
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
told
he's
got
to
buy
insurance
to
cover
this
risk
and
he
assumes
he
can
default
on
the
loan,
and
get
the
rebate
on
the
premium
and
put
it
in
his
pocket,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
very
unlikely
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
aren't
those
recoveries
all
against
a
larger,
unpaid
debt
that
they
weren't
able
to
collect?
i
mean,
isn't
that
always
when
they
get
the
money
on
these
refunds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
make
any
profit
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
the
buyer
gets
the
surplus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
100
million
or
whatever
the
big
sum
money
is
that
ford
has
collected
is
a
reduction
of
losses
it
otherwise
would
have
suffered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
haven't
made
any
money
by...
on
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
also,
it's
also
clear
that
the
buyers
would
never
have
had
a
legal
right
to
retain
any
of
that...
or,
i
mean,
any
equitable
right
to
any
of
that
money,
because
they
would
have
been
indebted
to
ford
for
an
amount
greater
than
the
amount
that's
in
dispute
in
every
one
of
these
cases.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
as
a
matter
of
history,
is
it
true
that
before
this
statute
was
passed
it
was
customary
for
the
finance
companies
to
buy
the
insurance
themselves,
and
then
they
would
buy
the
policy
and
make
the
purchase
pay
the
premiums?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
the
provision
in
the
contract
here
that
permits
the
buyer
to
buy
it
elsewhere
if
he
wants
to.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
it
used
to
be
in
the
home
mortgage
business
that
the
real
estate
brokers
would
make
the
money
on
the
insurance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
it's
probably
true
in
this
industry
as
well,
although
i
don't
know.
and
so,
is
this
just
sort
of
one
of
those
things
that
grew
out
of
the
fact
that
buyer
was
given
an
option
to
buy
his
own
insurance
and
therefore,
the
security
interest
was
created
in
that
policy?
whereas,
if
the
older
practice
had
been
followed,
the
dealer
would
have
just
owned
the
policy
himself.
