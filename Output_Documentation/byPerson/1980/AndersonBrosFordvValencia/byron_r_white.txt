justice
byron
r.
white
why
hasn't
the
'81
proposal
been
finalized?
there
just
isn't
time,
or
is
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
it
clear
that
if...
that
there
was
something
on
the
back
of
this
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a...
there
was
a
disclosure
on
the
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that
disclosure
had
been
put
on
the
front,
would
that...
is
it
agreed
that
it
would
have
been
adequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
in
this
particular
case
if
the
disclosure
on
the
back
had
been
put
on
the
front
would
the
seventh
circuit
have
come
out
the
way
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have...
there
would
have
been
no
problem
then,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
source
of...
what
was
the
source
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
that
the
disclosure
had
to
be
on
the
front,
rather
than
the
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
did
the
fifth
circuit
rely
on,
the
statute
or
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
say
it
violated
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
wholly
aside
from
regulation
z?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if...
what
is
your
position
if
it
hadn't
been
disclosed
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
why--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
thought
your
suggestion
was,
and
173's
suggestion
was
that
even
if
this
is
a
security
interest,
it
isn't
the
kind
that
needs
to
appear
on
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
is,
it
needn't
appear
on
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
awfully
hard
for
you
to
suggest
that
this
isn't
a
security
interest,
if
you
have
the
right...
you
agree
that
if
it
weren't
either
on
the
front
or
the
back
you
wouldn't
have
it?
justice
white
but
173
is
to
the
effect
that
even
if
it
is
it
needn't
be
on
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
give
me
the
statutory
citation,
what
section
in
the
statute
that
says
that
the
disclosure
must
be
on
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
still
want
to
know
where
are
the
words
that
say
a
disclosure
must
be
on
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
said...
if
you
had
just
provided
that
the
entire
contract
should
be
the
disclosure
statement,
then
what
about
that?
justice
white
yes,
but
it
wouldn't...
it
would
only
be
because
of
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
weren't
any
provision
like
that,
no
court
has
construed
the
statute
to
require
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you,
you
read
228.8(a)
is
that
it,
a
moment
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
source
of
the
requirement
for
the
disclosure
being
on
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
if
in
that
regulation
it
had
said
except
security
interests
in
the
unearned
premium?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
those
may
be
on
the
back?
suppose
that
that
regulation
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
isn't
that...
if
173
is
adopted,
why
isn't
that
in
effect
an
amendment
of...
it
just
adds
an
exception
to
228(a).
justice
white
and
it
doesn't
require
that
it
be
on
the
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
regulation
z
had
come
out
saying
that
some
security
interests
have
to
be
on
the
face
and
it's
enough
to
put
some
of
them
on
the
back,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
