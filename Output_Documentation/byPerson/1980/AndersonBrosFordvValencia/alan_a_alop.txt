mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that's
in
regulation
z,
your
honor,
at
12
c.f.r.
section
226.8(a).
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
language
in
226.8(a)(1)
is
that
all
of
the
disclosures
shall
be
made
together
on
either
the
note
or
other
instrument
evidencing
the
obligation
on
the
same
side
of
the
page
and
above
or
adjacent
to
the
place
for
the
customer's
signature.
where
the
customer
signs
on
the
front
side
of
the
page
and
only
on
the
front
side
of
the
page,
all
disclosures
must
be--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--i'm
not
reading
from
the
brief,
your
honor.
the
regulation
z
quotation
does
not
appear
in
either
of
the
briefs.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
twelve,
code
of
federal
regulations--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--the
other
side
has
not
disputed
this.
the
petitioners
have
never
claimed
that
it
could
be
adequately
disclosed
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
contract.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
at
12
c.f.r.--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that's
correct.
the
question
in
this
case,
whether
a
creditor's
claim
to
returned
insurance
premiums
has
to
be
disclosed
as
a
truth-in-lending
act
security
interest
is
disposed
of
by
the
fact
that
both
the
act
and
regulation
z
require
the
disclosure
of
any
security
interest.
the
use
of
the
broad
language
"any
security
interest"
reflects
an
unmistakable
intention
of
congress
that
every
security
interest
retained
by
a
creditor
in
the
course
of
a
credit
transaction
be
disclosed.
this
court,
in
the
cases
of
shea
v.
vialpando
and
harrison
v.
ppg
industries
has
indicated
that
the
use
of
the
term
"any"
precludes
limited
or
narrowed
statutory
construction.
the
broad
language
in
the
statute,
"any
security
interest",
would
also
controvert...
ford
credit's
suggestion,
that
only
essential
security
interests
need
be
disclosed.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
i
would
not
dispute
that,
your
honor.
the
proposed
fc-0173
does
leave
one
with
the
implication
that
it
is
not
a
security
interest.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
of
0173?
mr.
alan
a.
alop
i
believe
it's
in
the...
page
33
of
the
addendum...
no,
54
of
the
addendum.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
to
the
petitioners'
brief.
it's
addendum
number
54.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
it's
a
blue
brief.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
if
that--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--then
we
would
not
have
this
lawsuit
before
the
court
today,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
point
is
that
fc-0173
is
an
unadopted,
mere
proposal
of
the
federal
reserve
board
that
was
issued
with
the
caveat
that
it
may
be
withdrawn
or
it
may
be
altered
after
public
comment
was
scrutinized.
moreover,
the
federal
reserve
board
has
twice
in
writing
specifically
precluded
any
reliance
on
fc-0173
and
it
has
deferred
any
final
action
on
fc-0173
as
a
result
of
this
court's
granting
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
if
the
federal
reserve
board
adopted
fc-0173
because
it
uses
the
test
of
incidentalness
which
is
at
variance
with
the
plain
language
of
the
truth-in-lending
act
and
regulation
z,
and
because
it
is
also
at
variance
with
longstanding
federal
reserve
board
regulations,
or
rather,
the
interpretation
in
public
information
letter
377,
it
would
still
be
entitled
to
little
deference
under
the
traditional
test
of
skidmore
v.
swift
&
co.--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
i
also
said
that
it
is
at
variance
with
the
language
of
the
act,
which
requires--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--i
place
a
reliance
on
the
fact
that
regulation
z
defines
security
interest
to
encompass
any
interest
in
property
which
secures
payment
and
that
this
proposal
uses
the
test
of
incidentalness
which
ignores
the
concept
in
regulation
z
that
any
interest
in
property
constitutes
a
security
interest.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
act
does
not,
your
honor;
it
is
regulation
z--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--had
that
been
the
case,
i
believe
there
would
have
been
a
contradiction
between
the
regulation
z
definition--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--given
that
hypothesis...
that
section
226.2(gg)
that
is
the
security
interest
definition
of
regulation
z
would
not
exist,
then
of
course
fc-0173,
if
it
was
final
action,
would
control.
but
given--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
statute
does
not,
your
honor,
it
is
regulation
z
which
requires--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that's
correct.
i
would
note
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
issued
a
series
of
rulings
which
have
required
disclosure
of
a
wide
range
of
security
interests,
security
interests
which
do
not
fit
into
ford
credit's
characterization
of
essential
security
interest.
the
federal
reserve
board,
in
their
rulings
set
out
at
page
9
of
our
brief,
have
required
disclosure
of
security
interests
in
bank
accounts,
credit
union
accounts,
and
after
acquired
property.
the
test
is
not
whether
the
security
interest
is
essential,
but
whether...
but
merely
that
any
security
interest
be
required
to
be
disclosed.
the
regulation
z
definition,
as
i
indicated,
is
any
interest
in
property
which
secures
payment
or
performance
of
an
obligation
and
thus
a
two-pronged
test
is
set
up
by
regulation
z
and
every
court
which
has
applied
that
test
to
the
issue
in
this
case
has
concluded
that
a
creditor's
claim
to
returned
insurance
premiums
is
a
security
interest
under
the
truth-in-lending
act.
although
the
first
test,
the
first
prong
of
the
regulation
z
definition,
is
any
interest
in
property,
ford
credit
attempts
to
downplay
the
significance
of
the
interest
in
property
it
has
retained
in
this
case.
it
argues
that
this
is
an
identical
interest
and
therefore
need
not
be
disclosed.
however,
a
creditor's
claim
to
returned
insurance
premiums
is
significant:
to
ford
credit,
it
has
meant
more
than
10
million
dollars
by
virtue
of
that
provision
over
the
last
10
years
by
our
estimate,
an
estimate
ford
credit
has
not
disputed.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
this
case
involves
physical
damage
insurance
premiums,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
well
in
this
case,
for
example,
it
involved
the
physical
damage
insurance
premium
that
exceeded
$200.
given
a
cancellation
of
that
insurance
upon
the
default
of
the
consumer,
ford
credit
would
have
entitled
to
that
$215
by
virtue
of
its
clause.
and
in
this
case,
it
meant
$215
to
the
consumer.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
what
happens
is,
is
on
default
of
the
consumer
the...
by
virtue
of
the
contractual
assignment
clause,
ford
credit
is
entitled
to...
upon
default,
the
insurance
is
cancelled
because
there's
no
longer
any
need
for
the
continuation
of
physical
damage
insurance
since
the
car
has
been
repossessed,
at
that
moment,
ford
credit
is
entitled
to
all
returned
insurance
premiums
that
would
exist
at
that
time.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
well,
consumers
will
have
no
means
of
having
any
opportunity
to
know
that
they
are
entitled
to
these
funds
unless
the
matter
is
meaningfully
disclose
to
them.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
they
are
entitled
to...
without
any
clause,
of
course,
those
funds
would
go
directly
to
the
consumer,
if
ford
credit--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--the
policy
is...
the
insurance
company
issues
a
policy
directly
to
the
consumer
and
without--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--i
do
not
know.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
contract
requires
the
consumer
to
give
proof
of
insurance
to
the
dealer.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
money
of
course,
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
consumer
purchased
the
insurance
from
an
independent
insurance
company
and
ordinarily,
the
consumer
would
tend
to
think
that
that
money
would
come
back
to
the
consumer,
given
default
or
given
a
cancellation
of
the
insurance
policy.
but
by
virtue
of
ford
credit's--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
money
to
go
from
the
insurance
company
to
the
dealer,
to
ford
credit,
absent
the
clause
in
the--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--no,
the
insurance
protects
the
automobile
from
collision.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
this
is
collision
insurance.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
and
i
don't
think
that
consumers
have
an
idea
that
this
insurance
is
securing
the
debt,
they
are
not...
certainly
disclosed,
that's
not
disclosed
to
them,
by
virtue
of
the
contract,
in
the
present
case.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
it's
not
so
much
as
an
intentional
misleading--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--the
buyer
is
not
given
an
opportunity--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--under
the
contract
in
this
case,
the
buyer
really
is
not
given
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
know
that
this
sum
of
insurance--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--i'm
saying
that--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that
the
consumer
does
not
know
that
these
refunds
will
be
going
to
ford
credit
rather
than
to
be
coming
back
to
the
consumer,
absent
the
meaningful
disclosure
on
the
front
side
of
the
contract.
i
was
referring
to
the
significance
of
the
interest
to
the
creditor.
it's...
ford
credit
has
recovered
substantial
funds
by
virtue
of
this
security
interest
over
the
last
10
years
and
this
is
an
attractive--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--there
are--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--there
are
occasionally
surpluses,
in
which
the
secured
property,
the
automobile,
for
example,
will...
the
value
of
that
will
exceed
the
outstanding
debt.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
buyer
is
supposed
to
get
that
surplus,
the
buyer
will
have
no
means
of
knowing
that
this
money
is
coming
to
buyer
unless
it
is
disclosed.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
it
is
applied
to
outstanding
debts,
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
they
have
recovered
this
money
by
virtue
of
that.
with
regard
to--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--well,
this
money
would,
if
there
is
no
deficiency,
if
there
was
a
surplus,
of
course,
it
would
go
directly
to
the
consumer...
even,
however,
if
this
court
deemed
that
the
interest
in
this
case
to
be
incidental,
it
would
still
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
test
of
regular
z's
definition
of
security
interest,
which
merely
requires
any
interest
in
property.
the
second
prong
of
the
regulation
z
test
is
an
interest
in
property
which
secures
payment
or
performance
of
an
obligation.
the
interest
ford
credit
has
retained
in
returned
insurance
premiums
secures
payment
of
this
obligation
because
paragraph
17
of
ford
credit's
contract
specifically
authorizes
ford
credit
to
recover
returned
insurance
premiums
and
to
apply
them
towards
the
outstanding
debt.
thus,
ford
credit's
interest
in
this
returned
insurance
premium
secures
the
payment
of
the
obligation
and
both
prongs
of
the
regulation
z
test
for
security
interest
are
met.
contrary
to
the
assertion
of
ford
credit
which
was
made
today,
the
interest
it
retains
in
secured
premiums
would,
if
properly
disclosed
to
consumers,
be
understood
by
consumers--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--the
total
amount
of
the
premium
in
this
case
was
$215.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
return
would
of
course
depend
at
the
time...
on
the
timing
of
the
cancellation
of
the
insurance.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
no
we
do
not,
your
honor.
ford
credit
also
has
argued
that--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--the
record
doesn't
reflect
that,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
is
customary
for
both
mechanics
to
exist.
dealers
oftentimes
do
sell
this
insurance,
in
other
cases,
consumer--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--well,
in
both
situations
of
course,
the
dealer
retains
the
security
interest
in
returned
insurance
premiums.
under
both.
i
don't
think
the
historical
analysis
there
would
explain
anything.
ford
credit
argued
that
this
information
would
create
an
information
overload.
certainly
when
the
matter
is
disclosed,
as
it
is
in
the
present
contract,
buried
on
the
reverse
side
and
clothed
in
the
language
of
an
assignment
clause,
in
one
sentence
which
is
58
words
long,
it
is
confusing.
however,
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
gennuso
decision
indicated
that
a
creditor's
security
interest
in
returned
insurance
premiums
could
be
meaningfully
disclosed
to
consumers
in
a
matter
of
a
few
words
and
also
importantly,
intelligibly
and
meaningfully.
and
we
would
note
that
ford
credit's
new
contract
which
it
has
adopted
subsequent
to
the
decision
below,
does
disclose
this
information
to
consumers
on
the
front
side
of
the
contract--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
my
point
is
however,
that
they
have,
they
are
now
disclosing
this
information
concisely
in
a
matter
of
five
words
on
the
front
side
of
the
contract;
that's
hardly
creating
an
information
overload
that
they
refer
to.
i
would
also
note
that
ford
credit's
reliance
on
the
truth-in-lending
simplification
and
reform
act
is
misplaced.
that
act
is
not
effective
until
1982,
and...
it
is
not
retroactive,
it
is
not
made
applicable
to
pending
litigation
or
is
it
applicable...
or
made
retroactively
applicable,
thus
by
it's
own
terms,
the
simplification
act
is
not
relevant
to
this
case
and
by
virtue
of
1
united
states
code
section
109,
ford
credit's
liability
for
violations
of
the
existing
truth-in-lending
act
is
not
extinguished
by
virtue
of
the
enactment
of
the
simplification
act.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
section
1
u.
s.
code
section
109
merely
indicates
that
a
repeal
of
the
statute
or
an
amendment
to
that
statute
does
not
extinguish
liability
that
may
have--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
i'm
referring
to
the
simplification
act.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
the
point
is,
your
honor,
the
simplification
act
does
not
bear
on
these
proceedings
because
it
is
entirely
prospective
in--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--if
it
were
in
effect--
mr.
alan
a.
alop
--it
would,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
it
does
change
the
law
regarding
the
disclosure
of
security
interests.
there's
no
question
of
that.
the
point
is
that
ford
credit
argues
that
we
should
look
to
the
simplification
act
because
it
allegedly
interprets
the
truth-in-lending
act,
and
we
would
note
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
simplification
act
or
the
committee
reports
which
underlie
the
simplification
act,
that
interprets
or
construes
the
present
truth-in-lending
act
which
governs
this
transaction.
the
only
thing
ford
credit
has
relied
on,
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
act
or
in
the
committee
reports
that
underlie
it,
the
only
thing
ford
credit
has
relied
on
is
a
statement,
an
isolated
statement
of
one
senator...
senator
garn,
to
the
effect,
arguing
that...
excuse
me,
that
the
language...
but
senator
garn,
we
would
note,
was
not
a
member
of
the
body
that
enacted
the
truth-in-lending
act,
the
congress
that
enacted
the
truth-in-lending
act,
and
senator
garn's
statement
is
not
reflected
in
the
committee
report;
instead,
it
was
inserted
in
the
congressional
record
after
the
committee
report
was
issued
and
it's
not
reflected
in
the
committee
report.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
that's
correct.
however
this
court
in
the
past,
has
given
little
if
any,
weight
to
the
post-passage
remarks
of
legislators
regarding
the
meaning
of
previously
enacted
legislation,
particularly
where
the
legislator
was
not
a
member
of
the
enacting
body.
ford
credit
has
argued
that
the
application
of
the
decision
in
this
case
should
be
made
prospective
only,
with
regard...
except
as
with
regard
to
the
respondents
in
this
case.
however,
by
placing
the
argument
in
this
posture,
by
conceding
that
the
respondent
should
recover,
regardless
of
the
application
of
the
decision
as
given,
ford
credit
has
destroyed
any
adversarial
relationship
between
the
parties
on
this
issue.
that
is,
ford
credit
has
presented
no
case
or
controversy
to
this
court
on
the
issue
of
the
application
this
decision
is
to
be
given.
ford
credit
on
the
issue
of
non-retroactivity,
presents
no
case
or
controversy
in
that
it
seeks
no
relief
that
will
affect
the
respondents
in
any
way,
it
seeks
no
alteration
in
the
judgment
below,
and
as
a
consequence,
in
essence
it
seeks
an
advisory
opinion
that
will
affect
other
litigation,
pending
litigation
in
which
the
respondents
have
no
interest.
mr.
alan
a.
alop
as
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
prospective
application,
we
will
stand
on
our
briefs
with
regard
to
the
chevron
analysis.
thank
you,
your
honor.
