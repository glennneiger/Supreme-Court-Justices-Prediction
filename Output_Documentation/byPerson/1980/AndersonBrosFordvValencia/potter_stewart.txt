justice
stewart
isn't
that
the
crux
of
this
case?
no,
well,
there's
no
controversy
about
it,
is
there?
justice
stewart
well
now,
the
proposed
official
staff
interpretation
173,
which
as
i
understand
it
has
not
yet
become
effective,
does
say
that
this
kind
of
interest
need
not
be...
need
not
appear
on
the
face
of
the
statement.
and
if
it
says
that,
doesn't
it
necessarily
also
say
that
it's
not
a
security
interest,
if
the
statute,
as
you
tell
us
unequivocally
requires
that
any
security
interest
do
appear?
justice
stewart
where
does
the
relevant
text
to
that
regulation
appear?
justice
stewart
yes.
justice
stewart
well
what
if
this
proposal
had
been
promulgated
right
after
passage
of
the
act?
because
the
act
doesn't
contain,
as
i
understand
it,
any
definition
of
the
phrase
"security
interest".
justice
stewart
and
what
if
0173
had
been
promulgated,
immediately
after
passage
of
the
act,
saying
security
interests
means
any...
does
not
include
an
incidental
security.
justice
stewart
well,
there
would
have
been
no
regulation
z.
regulation
z,
itself,
would
have,
under
my
hypothesis
would
have
included
the
present
provisions
of
0173.
justice
stewart
it
would
control,
because
the
statute...
while
it
does
require
that
a
description
of
any
security
interests
be
stated,
it
doesn't
define
what
a
security
interest
is,
does
it?
justice
stewart
that
it
be
on
the
face.
justice
stewart
well
the
decision
below
told
it
it
had
to?
justice
stewart
that's
no...
not
very
surprising.
justice
stewart
what
does
that
statute
provide,
1
u.s.
code
section
109?
justice
stewart
previously
arisen
under
the
statute?
justice
stewart
--and
his
statement
was
to
the
effect
that
the
new
provisions
of
the
simplification
act
were
simply
clarifying?
justice
stewart
the
court
announced
a
decision
this
morning
with
which
i
am
sure
you
haven't
yet
had
time
to
familiarize
yourself...
kirchberg
v.
feenstra,
which
might
have
some
bearing
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
