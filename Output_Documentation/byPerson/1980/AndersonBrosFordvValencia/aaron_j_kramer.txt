mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
it
poses
two
broad
issues.
the
first
of
which
is
whether
the
entire
credit
industry,
whose
stock
in
trade
is
security
interests
failed
to
recognize
and
disclose
a
security
interest
required
to
be
disclosed
under
the
truth-in-lending
act.
secondly,
this
case
poses
the
question
of
whether
even
if
such
a
hard
to
imagine
mistake
occurred,
the
ends
of
justice
are
served
by
applying
any
such
decision
retroactively
to
any
case
other
than
the
one
at
bar.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
they
will,
your
honor,
but
not
with
respect
to
contracts
that
were
written
with
respect
to
the
former
statute,
the
present
statute,
which
are
now--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
well
there
are...
this
contract
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
paradigm
of
the
industries
contract.
it
has--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--we
are
talking
about
millions
of
contracts,
your
honor.
this
is
the
industries'
form--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--there
are...
we
have
no
number
as
to
the
precise
number
of
cases
which
have
raised
this
issue.
there
have
been,
however,
27
decisions
of
various
circuit
and
district
courts
on
this
issue
in
15
different
cases
that
have
already
reached
the
courts.
certainly
whatever
the
decision
of
this
court
is
on
this
issue
will
be
the
landmark
case
in
this
area.
and
depending
on
what
this
court
holds--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--except
for
the
new
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
except
for
those
millions
of
outstanding
contracts
which
presently
exist.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
well
your
honor,
for
certain
violations--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--for
this
one
it
is
twice
the
amount...
penalty
in...
twice
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge,
up
to
$1,000
per
contract
where
the
truth-in-lending
act
is
violated.
and
what
the
court
has
before
it
now
is
the
industries'
form--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--i
am
most
certainly
saying
that,
your
honor.
as
well,
an
affirmance
here
would
put
defaulting
debtors
in
the
position
of
having,
even
those
that
are...
have
a
contract
that
was
entered
into
more
than
a
year
prior
to
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--no
there
is
not,
your
honor.
these
actions
may
be
brought
in
either
the
federal
courts
or
the
state
courts.
but
most
jurisdictions
have
state
laws
which
provide
that
even
time
barred
counter-claims
for
contracts
entered
into
for
more
than
a
year
prior
to
the
date
on
which
the
action
was
filed
can
be
brought
as
counter-claims
and
are
revived.
so
that
any
defaulting
creditor,
rather,
any
defaulting
debtor
who
is
sued
by
a
creditor
to
collect
a
deficiency
judgment
on
an
amount
owed
on
a
car
who
may
have
entered
into
his
contract
four
or
five
years
ago
could
bring
a
$1000
plus
attorneys
fees
counter-claim,
or
action
for
recoupment
under
most
jurisdictions
and
that
would
be
greater,
in
most
cases,
than
the
deficiencies
in
these
cases.
now
the
respondents
in
this
case
estimate
that
ford
motor
credit
company
alone
repossesses
10,000
cars
per
year.
the
industry
of
course,
repossesses
and
has
to
bring
deficiency
actions
in
a
far
greater
number
of
cases.
the
fact
that
this
is
the
industries'
form
contract
presents
a
very
great
problem
for
the
industry.
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
that
the
respondents
purchase
and
financed
the
purchase
of
a
used
car
in
1977
from
anderson
bros.
ford.
almost
immediately
they
were
disenchanted
with
their
purchase
because
of
mechanical
difficulties
and
sought
to
rescind
the
transaction
after
unsuccessfully
pursuing
certain
state
consumer
complaint
remedies.
those
were
unsuccessful,
but
they...
the
respondents
did
file
this
truth-in-lending
action,
alleging
five
separate
truth-in-lending
violations
in
this
form.
in
an
opinion
rendered
on
october
31,
1978,
the
trial
court
dismissed
entirely
those
truth-in-lending
allegations.
in
particular,
it
dismissed
the
allegation
as
to
the
claim
that
the
assignment
on
the
back
of
the
contract
which
was
an
assignment
of
physical
damage
in
unearned
insurance
premiums
by
the
debtor
to
the
creditor
was
a
security
interest,
that
was
the
allegation,
and
that
was
one
of
the
five
allegations
which
was
entirely
dismissed
by
the
trial
court.
as
to
this
particular
allegation
that
the
assignment
was
a
security
interest
that
should
have
been
not
disclosed
on
the
back
but
on
the
front
of
the
contract
under
the
truth-in-lending
act,
but
the
district
court
looked
at
the
normal
meaning
of
the
term
security
interest
in
the
act,
and
looked
at
the
usual
and
customary
meaning
of
those
words
as
used
in
the
contract,
and
found
that
there
was
no
security
interest
here
in
the
assignment
of
unearned
physical
damage
insurance
premiums,
appearing
on
the
back
of
the
contract.
and
therefore,
no
requirement
that
that
appear
on
the
front
of
the
contract.
now,
developments
occurred
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
fifth
circuit
rendered
an
opinion
contrary
to
that
which
we
called
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
and
he
reversed
his
position,
eventually
that
reversal
against
finding
the
violation
of
the
truth-in-lending
act
as
to
this
assignment
clause
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit.
there
are
four
uncontrovertible
elements
which
stand
as
walls
that
surround
the
issues
in
this
case,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court's
decision
will
be
made
somewhere
within
the
confines
of
those
four
walls.
they
are:
the
true
nature
of
the
interest,
the
assignment
interest
that
is
before
this
court;
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
specific
legislative
history
of
adoption
of
the
act's
security
interest
provision;
the
promulgation
by
the
federal
reserve
board
staff
in
1981,
of...
federal
reserve
board
proposed
official
interpretation
173,
which
is
precisely
in
point
on
this
issue.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that
is
of
the
present
truth-in-lending
act,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
only.
it
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
the
simplification
act,
that
is
right.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
it
did...
in...
follow,
and
indeed,
the
federal
reserve
board
had
the
benefit
of
the
intensive
congressional
hearings
on
the
simplification
act
that
led
to
adoption
of
the
simplification
act.
and
it
adopted,
after
there
were
these
27
separate
decisions
and
15
cases
raising
this
issue,
the
federal
reserve
board
also
had
the
benefit
of
those
conflicting
decisions,
all
before
it
held
in
its
proposed...
and
it
has
not
yet
been
adopted
and
it
was
not
finalized--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--the
gist
of
173,
your
honor,
was
that
consumers
are
not
aided
by
the
disclosure
of
the
assignment
clause
of
the
physical
damage
insurance...
the
insurance
premiums
on
the
back
of
the
contract...
they
would
not
be
aided
by
putting
that
on
the
front
of
the
contract
to
carry
out
the
purpose--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--they
held
that
although...
a
technical
reading,
as
had
been
accomplished
in
certain
courts
in
certain
circuit
courts
could
support
that
decision
that
that
would...
that
such
an
incidental
interest
was
not
intended
by
the
act,
and
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
better
served
by
not
disclosing
that
provision
as
a
security
interest
on
the
front.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
for
purposes
of
the
statute
they
said
it
should
not
be
disclosed
as
a
security
interest,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
they
were
exactly
the
same.
the
1970
unofficial
interpretation
issued
by
the
board
staff
does
certainly
use
the
word
appropriate.
however,
it
involved
a
different
kind
of
insurance
than
physical
damage
insurance
on
a
vehicle,
where
the
vehicle
is
the
real
security
interest
in
the
transaction.
and
the
only
security
interest
which
appears
in
the
1970
unofficial
interpretation
by
the
board
was
the
lender's
security
interest
in
the
insurance
itself,
which
he
was
financing;
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
as
the
transaction
where
the
unearned
insurance
premiums
on
physical
damage
insurance
are
entirely
incidental
to
the
real
security
interest
in
the
transaction
as
we
have
here,
which
is
the
financed
vehicle,
which
is
clearly
disclosed
on
the
front
of
the
contract
and
it's
disclosure
would
be
clouded
if
there
were
such
an
incidental
interest
taken
off
of
the
back
of
the
industries'
form
contract
and
put
on
the
front,
to
confuse
the
issue
of
what
security
interest
the
consumer
was
giving
up
in
the
transaction.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
accidental
death
and
dismemberment
policy
where
there
was
a
single
lifetime
premium,
your
honor,
and
the
only
thing
that
the
creditor
was
taking
in
that
case
was
a
security
interest
in
the
unearned
premiums.
there
was
no
other
security
interest
in
that
transaction.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
physical
damage
insurance
on
a
vehicle
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
no,
your
honor,
it's
very
clear
that
it
is
out
of
deference
for
this
court's
authority.
clearly,
the
federal
reserve
board
under
the
court's
opinion
in
milhollin
had
the
authority
to
clear
up
this
matter
once
and
for
all,
and
tell
the
credit
community
which
is
only
looking
for
direction
in
such
matters,
and
will
follow
that
direction
from
a
central
authority...
which
your
honors
found
in
milhollin
was
the
federal
reserve
board
clearly,
and
its
power
was
to
enforce,
apply
and
interpret
the
act
and
the
regulation.
that...
what
the
board
has
referred
to
as
a
deferral
of
final
action,
and
not
a
withdrawal
at
all,
came
only
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
172
prior
official
staff
interpretations
of
the
federal
reserve
board
have
been
adopted
without
any
substantive
change,
as
we
indicated
in
appendix
b
to
our
reply
brief,
is
a
factor
that
the
court
ought
to
consider,
because
these
things
were
not
promulgated
as
trial
balloons,
as
counsel
for
the
respondents
has
argued,
but
rather
as
seriously
well
considered
and
thoroughly
thought-through
determinations
by
the
federal
reserve
board
as
to
interpreting
the
act
that
governs
the
framework
of,
in
determining
commerce
and
credit
in
the
united
states.
indeed,
although
173
is
only
a
proposed
agency
interpretation,
the
courts
have
held
applying
this
court's
skidmore
v.
swift
decision,
that
even
a
proposed
agency
interpretation
is
entitled
to
such
persuasive
weight
as
is
evidenced
from
such
things
as
the
thoroughness
of
its
consideration
and
the
validity
of
its
reasoning.
petitioners
submit--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
federal
reserve
board,
of
course,
is
empowered
to
interpret
the
act,
just
as
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
empowered
to
interpret
the
securities
laws.
and
this
court's
opinion
in
1975,
the
court
held
that
even
though
the...
in
the
forman
case,
the
securities
law
of
1934
refers
to
any
stock...
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
had
the
power
to
interpret
that
to
exclude
stock
in
a
cooperative
housing
project
as
not
being
a
security,
even
though
the
express
words
of
the
language
of
the
statute
that
the
agency
was
empowered
to
interpret
did
use
the
term
any
stock,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
make
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
strict
words
of
the
statute
should
be
followed
in
this
case,
or
the
strict
words
of
the
regulation,
which
indeed
are
not
in
point
as
to
this
type
of
assignment
of
an
interest
unearned
premiums,
but
the
respondent's
literal
interpretation
cuts
the
heart
of
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
act
out
of
it,
does
not
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
act,
which
is
to
permit
informed,
comparison
credit
shopping
as
this
court
held
in
the
milhollin
decision.
and
the
board's
determination,
after
having
thoroughly
considered,
in
proposing
173,
the
27
decisions
in
the
conflicting
district
and
circuit
court
cases
on
this
matter,
who
had...
the
board
had,
at
the
time
they
proposed
173,
the
benefit
of
intensive
congressional
hearings
on
the
simplification
act,
and
its
own
ongoing
revision
of
regulation
z
before
it
proposed
173,
so
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioners
given
those
factors
which
support
the
validity
of
the
reasoning
of
173,
and
the
determination
of
the
federal
reserve
board
particularly
backed
against
the
fact
that
none
of
the
prior
official
staff
interpretations
of
the
board
which
were
proposed
were
changed
in
any
way
before
they
became
final.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
well,
it
is
clear,
your
honor,
that
a
contract
was
included
with
the
appendix.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
there
is
no
question,
no
question.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
well
your
honor,
there
is
a
problem
with
respect
to
that,
because
the
courts
have
held,
including
our
seventh
circuit,
has
held
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
truth-in-lending
act
if
you
overdisclose
and
claim
a
security
interest
where
you
do
not
have
one.
for
example--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--i
don't
think
the
seventh
circuit
would
have
come
out
the
way
it
did,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--that's
right.
the
point
of
the
petitioners
is
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
wrong
in
its
decision.
and
indeed,
in
reading
its
decision
and
in
reading
the
very
reluctant,
two
concurring
opinions,
from
judges
cudahy
and
swygert,
it
is
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit
felt
it
was
being
dragged
along
by
what
it
was
being
required
to
do
in
providing
a
very
liberal
and
very
technical
construction
of
the
truth-in-lending
act.
and
i
would
point
out
to--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
more
or
and
less
looked
at
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
and--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
the
philosophy
that
if
it
was
important
enough
to
claim
in
the
contract
it
was
important
enough
to
put
on
the
front.
and
that's
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
circuit's--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--and
they
said
it
violated
the
statute.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
they
said,
the
cases
that
have
so
held
have
held
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
however,
that
rationale
would
put
everything
that
was
on
the
back
of
the
contract
on
the
front
of
the
contract,
your
honor.
it
would
not,
as
the
board
has
noted
in
173,
promote
proper...
the
purposes
of
the
act
or
proper
comparison
credit
shopping--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--if
it
hadn't
been
disclosed
at
all,
even
on
the
back,
your
honor,
then
the
creditor
would
not
have
that
right
to
unearned
physical
damage
insurance
premiums.
it
would
not
be...
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
it
would
not
then
be
part
of
the
contract
if
you
couldn't
claim
it.
putting
it
on
the
back
makes
it
part
of
the
contract;
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
it
was
required
under
the
truth-in-lending
act
to
be
disclosed
on
the
front
as
a
security
interest,
along
with
the
vehicle
which
was
the
real
security
interest
in
this
transaction.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
it
would
have
satisfied
the
seventh
circuit,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
out
two
important
factors
with
respect
to
that.
the

circuit

its
decision.
if
your
honor
looks
at
footnote
24,
i
believe
it
is,
in
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
it
is
obvious,
and
that
footnote
states,
"it
may
be
critical
to
the
credit
industry
that
there
is
not
an
official
staff
interpretation
of
the
federal
reserve
board
on
this
question,
but
there
is
not.
"
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
and...
and
there
still
isn't,
your
honor.
except,
but
for...
but
for
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari,
it--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--it
would
be
operative,
it
would
be
operative.
and
as
i--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--your
honor,
it
would
not
have
satisfied
a
requirement
of
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
because
neither
the
regulation
nor
the
statute
require
it,
and
all
that
must
be
on
the
front
is
what
is
required
of
it,
and
as
i've
indicated--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--one
of
the
problems
faced
by
creditors
in
this
field
is
that
if
they
put
on
the
front
such
a
contract
something
which
is...
the
state--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--yes.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
if
your
honors
so
state,
that's
correct.
indeed,
if
your
honors
were
to
so
hold--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--it
is
the...
173
does
not
state,
categorically,
that
this
is
not
a
security
interest.
but
what
173
says
is
that
this
incidental
interest--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--it's
not
the
type
of
interest
that
need
appear
on
the
front,
or--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that
if
it
weren't
on
the
back
we
wouldn't
have
the
right.
i
don't
agree
that
it
is
a
security
interest,
it
does
not
have
the
elements
that
a
security
interest
classically
has.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
to
the
effect,
your
honor,
that
the...
it
doesn't
use
those
exact
words,
it
says
this
incidental
interest
need
not
be
shown
on
the
front,
it
would
not
aid
the
purposes
of
the
act,
in
fact,
it
would
retard
the
purposes
of
the
act
if
it
were
shown
on
the
front.
it
would
confuse,...
in
the
milhollin
case...
i
had
the
opportunity
to
read
the
argument
that
was
made
before
the
court
in
that
case.
and
in
that
case,
the
argument
was
made
that
simply
by
adding
two
words
to
the
front
of
the
same
contract
there
could
be
compliance
with
the
truth-in-lending
act.
respondents
in
this
case
allege
that
by
adding
five
words
to
the
front
of
this
contract
there
could
be
compliance
with
the
act--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
exactly.
and
this
is
our
position
and
the
federal
reserve
board's
proposed
position
is
not
such
a
required
truth-in-lending
security
interest
required
under
the
act
to
appear
on
the
front.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
it
is
21,
your
honor,
that
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
your
honor
the
statute
says
that
the...
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
pertinent
provisions
in
our
petition
for
the
writ,
of
both
regulation
z
and--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--and
of
the
statute
itself--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--regulation
z
would
be
12
c.f.r.--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--we've
listed
these
in
the
front,
your
honor...
on
page...
pages
1
and
2.
i
would
point
out--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--the
requirement,
your
honor,
would
be
with
reference
to
disclosure
statements
under
the
truth-in-lending
act.
the
regulation
and
the
statute
uses
the
term
disclosure
statement,
and
for
purposes
of
the
act
the
front
of
the
contract
that's
in
court
is
the
disclosure
statement.
a
disclosure
statement
may
be
given
as
a
separate
document
on...
and
not
as
the
front
of
a
contract...
but
in
this
case,
the
front
of
the
contract
is
the
disclosure
statement.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that
would
not
be
permissible
under
the
provisions
which
require
that
the
disclosure
statement
be
on
one
sheet
of
paper
and
i
believe,
on
the
front,
exclusively.
in
conclusion,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
pointed
out
to
the
court
in
our
brief
that
the
adoption
of
the
original
truth-in-lending
act,
the
act
that
this
case
comes
under,
and
its
security
interest
provisions,
came
from
the
floor
of
congress
with
the
idea
of
preventing
not...
and
not
affecting
the
type
of
interest
which
is
before
the
court
now,
but
what
was
referred
to
on
the
floor
of
congress
by
congressman
cahill
and
senator
proxmire,
as
a
vicious
second
mortgage
racket
that
involved
the
taking
of
second
mortgages
on
purchasers
homes
and
borrowers
homes,
unwittingly
given
by
such
borrowers...
that's
what
the
security
interest
provision
of
the
act
was
adopted...
to
put
in...
that's
how
it
came
up
from
the
floor
of
congress.
the
incidental
interest
which
is
before
the
court
at
this
time,
there
is
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
originally
adopted
the
act,
under
the
truth-in-lending
simplification
act,
chairman
volcker
has
said
in
the
letter
that
is
attached
to
our
reply
brief
as
an
appendix,
that
this
issue
disappears
under
the
new
act.
and
it's
very
clear
that
this
disclosure
is
not
required
under
the
new
act.
in
conclusion,
i
would
cite
to
the
court,--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--no,
your
honor,
we
will
not
have
to
make
any
disclosure
with
respect
to
incidental
interests,
such
as--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--in
the
automobile,
we
will,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that's
the
one
we
did
make,
and--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--and
that
was
not
a
second
mortgage.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
it
is
limited...
congress'
intent
is
limited
to
significant
interests
in
property,
and
in
knowledge
on
the
part
of
buyers--
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
--both,
your
honor.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that's
correct.
as
judge
cudahy
said,
and
he
was
joined
in
by
judge
swygert
in
his
concurring
opinion,
that
to
require
the
disclosure
of
this
particular
assignment
on
the
face
of
the
contract
would
merely
add
virtually
inconsequential
information;
lengthening,
complicating
and
trivializing
this
disclosure
for
no
apparent
reason.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
that's
respondent's
contention,
and
this
court
rejected
the
contention
in
milhollin
with
only
two
words
having
to
be
added
to
that
contract,
because
it
was
not
within
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
it
could
be
done,
your
honor.
it
is
done
on
a
new
form
of
ford
credit
contract,
however,
that
form
of
contract
gives
up
significant
interest
that
is
taken
under
this
broader
form.
for
the
reasons
that
we've
stated
in
our
briefs
and
that
i've
had
a
chance
to
reach
in
argument
today,
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
on
the
merits
or
at
the
minimum,
because
of
the
problems
created
with
respect
to
this
form
contract,
make
any
decision
on
this
issue
affirming
prospective
only.
thank
you.
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
one
minute
left,
your
honor?
mr.
aaron
j.
kramer
thank
you.
the
purpose
of
the
clause
that
we've
been
discussing
today
is
not
to
gain
access
to
incidental...
unearned
security
interests,
but
rather
to
keep
the
real
security
interests
in
these
transactions
not
only
for
ford
credit
but
for
the
industry
insured...
and
that
is,
to
maintain
insurance
on
the
financed
vehicles
themselves
which
are
the
real
security
interests
in
the
transaction.
we
do
not
only
rely
upon
senator
garn
who
is
a
member
of
the
committee
that
adopted
the
simplification
act,
but
also
the
federal
reserve
board
that
held
that
the
simplification
act
clarifies
this
issue
as
intended
by
the
original
act.
finally,
with
respect
to
this
matter,
creditors
are
only
looking
for
clear
direction
from
the
federal
reserve
board
which
has
stated
that
clear
direction
in
173,
and
but
for
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari
that
would
be
the
law
today.
respondent
should
not
be
permitted
to
embrace
the
federal
reserve
board's
decision
while
at
the
same
time
ignoring
173.
