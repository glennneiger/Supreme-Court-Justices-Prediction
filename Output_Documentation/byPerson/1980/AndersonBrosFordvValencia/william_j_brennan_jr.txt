justice
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
statute
there's
a
fixed
recovery,
is
there
not,
$1000
or
something?
justice
jr.
for
this
one.
justice
jr.
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
affirmance
here
would
encourage
lawsuits
to
recover
that
penalty,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
is
there
any
limitation
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
for
such
suits?
justice
jr.
now
is
that
interpretation
of
the
truth-in-lending
act,
or
is
it
of
the
new
statute--
justice
jr.
--only?
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
simplification
act?
justice
jr.
that's
not
too
clear,
i
think.
in
chronology,
it
followed
the
adoption
of
the
simplification
act,
didn't
it?
justice
jr.
now
what
was
the
gist
of
173?
justice
jr.
but
it
wasn't
explicit,
was
it,
that
the
assignment
was
not
a
security
interest?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
yes
or
no...
did
they
interpret
a
bulletin
to
say
that
the
assignment
was
not
a
security
interest
for
purposes
of
the
statute?
justice
jr.
--it's
this
language,
is
it,
that
appears
on
the
back:
"buyer
hereby
assigns
to
seller
any
monies
payable
under
such
insurance,
by
whomever
obtained,
including
returned
or
unearned
premiums.
"
justice
jr.
and
did
you
answer
my
brother
white
that
if
that
had
appeared
on
the
front
it
would
have...
it
would
not
have
been
adequate?
justice
jr.
one-seventy-three
would
be
operative.
justice
jr.
but
i
still
don't...
without
regard
to
what
the
seventh
circuit
might
have
held,
what
would
be
view
whether
had
what
i
read
you
appeared
on
the
front,
would
that
have
satisfied
any
disclosure
requirement...
do
you
suggest?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
yes,
but
if
this...
if
we
were
to
say
that
this
is
a
security
interest...
not
assignment--
justice
jr.
--then,
i
gather,
under,
the
statute
and
regulation,
irrespective
of
173
would
have
had
to
have
appeared
on
the
front,
would
it?
justice
jr.
mr.
kramer,
may
i
be
sure
about
this?
justice
jr.
the
reason,
if
it
has
to
appear
on
the
front,
is
because
the
statute
says
security
interests
must
be
disclosed
on
the
front
and
if
this
is
a
security
interest
that
provision
of
the
statute
then
requires
its
appearance
on
the
front.
justice
jr.
yes?
justice
jr.
all
right.
so
what
does
it--
justice
jr.
now
heres's
regulation
z
at
page
2
of
the
petition...
what's
the
language
in
regulation
z
that
says
the
front?
justice
jr.
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
alop,
may
i
ask
how
much
actually
is
involved
here?
justice
jr.
oh,
and
the
return
would
be
about
what?
justice
jr.
do
we
know
here
when
it
was?
justice
jr.
and
does
the
simplification
act
in
terms...
have
some
provision
that
would
bear
on
this
question
if
it
were
in
effect
now?
justice
jr.
no,
i
say,
if
it
were
in
effect
now.
justice
jr.
would
it
have
a
bearing
on--
