justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kramer,
i
have
some
difficulty
with
the
various
levels
of
regulations
and
the
weight
we
should
give
them.
the
1970
regulation,
which
doesn't
seem
to
be
mentioned
in
the
1981
promulgation,
simply,
at
the
end,
says
in
the
event
of
the
customers
default,
your
client
would
have
the
right
to
cancel
the
policy
and
apply
any
premium
refund
to
the
unpaid
balance
of
the
loan.
under
the
circumstances,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
disclose
the
loan
company's
ownership
of
the
policy
as
a
type
of
interest
under
12
c.f.r.
section
so-and-so.
i
had
some
trouble
with
that,
originally,
because
it
didn't
seem
to
me
to
state
flatly
it
must
be
disclosed,
the
words
it
is
appropriate
to
disclose
it
simply
said
may
be
in
an
excess
of
caution...
but
i
was
also
troubled
by
the
fact
that
the
1981
promulgation,
the
new
regulation
which
goes
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction,
didn't
seem
to
refer
to
the
1970
regulation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
they
were
different
kinds
of
insurance,
the
1970
letter
referred
to
life
insurance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
1981
regulation
would
apply
to
unearned
premiums
on
physical
damage...
insurance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
suppose
that's
true
only
with
respect
to
agencies
which
are
not
empowered
to,
in
effect,
kind
of
fill
in
the
blanks
or
make
definitions
and
that
sort
of
thing?
skidmore
v.
swift
dealt
with
an
agency
which
was
not
expressly
authorized
by
congress
to
interpret
the
act--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kramer,
i
think
a
moment
ago
you
referred
to
footnote
24
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
district
opinion...
as
i
see
it
now,
the
last
footnote
in
the
opinion
is
footnote
21?
justice
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
concede
that
if
the
federal
reserve
board
goes
ahead
and
adopts
the
resolution,
it
will
be
a
valid
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
regulation
z
is,
itself,
a
promulgation
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
then
that
it's
contrary
to
regulation
z,
when
the
regulation
z
is
in
effect
superseded
in
part
by
this
new
regulation,
is
rather
hard
for
me
to
follow.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
not
hard
to
follow.
but
do
you
really
place
much
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
new
regulation
is
at
variance
with
the
old
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
term
insurance
premiums,
you're
not
talking
about
the
life
insurance
premiums
that...
they
were
talking
about
in
1970,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
what
exactly
is
the
property
interest;
you
know,
described
in--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
why
would
ford...
why
would
insurance
company
have
cancelled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
isn't
an
amendment...
or,
you're
talking
about
the
simplification
act,
not
the
proposed
regulations?
