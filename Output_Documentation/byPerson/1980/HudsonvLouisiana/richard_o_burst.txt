mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
that
i
present
to
the
court
today,
i
think,
is
limited
in
issue
and
scope,
and
briefly
stated,
simply
involves
where
a
trial
court
in
louisiana
after
hearing
the
evidence,
sustained
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
insufficient
evidence
and
the
defendant
was
retried.
subsequently,
before
appeal
became
final,
this
court
rendered
a
decision
in
burks
v.
united
states.
the
case
was
taken
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
on
a
writ,
first
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
district
court,
and
then
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
on
certiorari.
the
supreme
court
issued
an
opinion
denying
our
relief
after
accepting
cert
and
that's
what
brings
us
to
this
court.
we
take
issue
with
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
basically
on
two
areas
where
i
feel
that
they
have
based
their
opinion
on
two
faulty
premises.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
it
did
when
it
decided
the
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
specific
issue.
the
issue
before
them
was
limited,
as
it
is
now,
precisely
and
only
to
the
double
jeopardy
question.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that
is
correct.
and
i
argued
burks
completely.
now,
jackson
had
not
been
issued,
but
burks
was
before
them.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
they
do
treat
it,
but
they
treat
it
on
the
same
basis
as
this
court
discussed
in
jackson
v.
virginia.
in
other
words,
they
applied
it
on
a
no
evidence
versus
insufficient
evidence.
in
fact,
in
the
first
page,
the
first
two
pages
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
they
set
forth
the
issue
of
burks
as
rendered
by
the
chief
justice
of
this
court
and
then
they
set
forth
the
issue
before
them
and
they
use
exactly
the
same
language,
only
they
rule
contrary
to
what
this
court
did.
i
can
point
that
out.
it's
in
the
appendix,
49a.
justice
blanche
quoted
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
in
the
first
paragraph
he
uses
the
term,
"solely
for
lack
of
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
jury's
verdict.
"
then,
on
page
48,
in
reference
to
discussing
burks,
he
states
that
this
court
decided
and
reversed
on
the
issue
of
solely
for
lack
of
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
i
would.
i
further...
i
feel
that
also
in
justice
tate's
concurring
opinion
that
he
simply
states
facts
that
were
not
mentioned
by
the
trial
judge
in
his
ruling.
i
think
the
trial
judge's
ruling
is
concise
and
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
at
all
in
the
trial
judge's
ruling,
it
would
be
by
virtue
of
the
precise
language
he
used
where
he
said
that
"i
viewed
the
same
evidence,
that
in
the
present
case
i
heard
the
same
evidence
the
jury
did.
"
"i
am
convinced
that
there
was
no
evidence,
certainly
not
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
sustain
the
verdict
of
homicide
committed
by
the
defendant
on
this
particular
victim.
"
and
the
only
ambiguity
there
is
whether
he
was
applying
a
no
evidence
rule
or
insufficient
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think
that
that's
really
a
difference
without
a
distinction,
that
he--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--that's
correct.
and
i
feel--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--i
think
that--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--i
have
to
just
take
the
words
as
they're
spoken.
i
was
not--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--well,
i
have
two
answers
to
that
question.
louisiana
laws
that
existed
then
did
not
permit
a
trial
judge
to
withhold
the
submission
to
the
jury.
in
1975,
and
prior
to
that
time...
and
i
have
both
sections
cited
in
my
brief...
prior
to
'75
there
was
an
ability
of
the
trial
judge
to,
in
effect,
sustain
a
motion
for
directed
verdict.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
in
'75.
not
at
the
time
of
this
trial
they
did
not.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
sir.
the
first
and
only
vehicle
that
a
defendant
has
in
louisiana
to
raise
the
issue
of
insufficient
evidence
is
a
motion
for
new
trial,
and
that's
it.
and
that
was
the
law
at
the
time
this
was
tried,
that
is
subsequent--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
well,
that
would
be
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
stevens.
and
that
would
be
that
even
if
that's
what
he
was
saying,
that's
what
the
law
required
him
to
do,
and
specifically,
precisely
that.
in
other
words,
if
at
that
point
in
time,
if
in
his
opinion
there
was
insufficient
evidence,
then
he
was
to
so
hold.
and
by
so
holding
he
has
placed
the
case
in
a
position
where
it
cannot
be
retried
under
our
constitution.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
sir.
it
would
not
be,
because
i
feel
that
there
is
no
constitutional
guarantee
of
a
motion
for
directed
verdict,
or
even
for
an
appeal
for
that
matter.
i
feel
that
as
long
as
all
people
are
treated
alike,
it
makes
no
difference.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
case,
in
louisiana
law,
there
is
no
motion
for
directed
verdict
available
to
the
defendant
in
a
jury
trial
and
the
first
time,
by
their
law,
that
he
can
raise
the
issue
of
insufficient
evidence
is
on
motion
for
new
trial.
i
don't
think
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
unconstitutional,
but
i
do
feel
that
in
this
case
that
the
ruling
of
the
trial
judge
could
not
have
been
clearer.
indeed,
the
entire
ruling
which
is
transcribed
for
the
court,
it
sets
the
basis
for
his
ruling,
what
he
observed,
and
the
factual
basis.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
sir.
i
do.
and
i
feel
that...
when
i
say
the
double,
i
say
that,
doubly,
that
what
i
feel
is
the
faulty
premises
that
the
louisiana
court
bases
its
decision
on,
is
that
is
one,
is
that
certainly
one
cannot
read
the
trial
judge's
statement,
his
opinion,
and
it
is
clear
what
he
is
ruling.
at
the
very
outside
he
is
saying
there
was
insufficient
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
convict
this
man.
that
would
be
taking
his
statement
most
favorably
to
the
state's
position.
i
say
he
still,
even
with
that
finding,
that
there
is
no
retrial,
or
should
be
none.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
sir,
and
the
existing
law,
at
that
time,
in
even
the
state
i'm
from,
that
was
the
law.
if
they...
in
effect,
what
they
were
saying
was,
if
you
move
for
a
new
trial,
you
waive
the
argument
to
your
constitutional
double
jeopardy.
but
i
think
that
is
particularly
innocuous
here,
because
under
louisiana
law
it
was
the
only
vehicle
he
had.
you
know,
if
you're
requiring
a
man,
he
can't
waive
that
issue
until
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
then
at
the
same
time,
you're
saying,
but
if
you
do
raise
it
you
waive
your
double
jeopardy
argument.
and
that's
why
i
think
that
this
particular
statutory
system
is
possibly
unconstitutional.
if
it
were
applied
in
a
meaning
where
you
said,
because
i
asked
for
a
new
trial,
i
do
waive
my
right
to
raise
double
jeopardy,
then
i
think
it's
unconstitutional,
as
requiring
him
to
choose
between
two
constitutional
safeguards.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
sir,
because
double
jeopardy
does,
as
this
court
clearly
set
out
in
burks,
that
that
is
not
a
jeopardy
question,
where
it's
an
error
of
law,
and
where
it's
simply
both
sides
need
a
different,
or
a
new
chance
to
put
on
and
correct
that
error.
but
this
court
has,
i
think,
clearly
said
in
burks
that
where
there's
a
failure
to
muster
sufficient
evidence
the
state
doesn't
get
a
second
chance.
and
in
this
case
is
what
they
got,
and
indeed
they
came
forth
at
the
second
trial
with
an
eyewitness,
ten
months
later.
the
second
position,
i
think,
that
is...
again,
i
will
use
this
term
"faulty
premise"
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
using,
is
simply
that
they
are
attempting
to
apply
the
no
evidence
rule
on
both
ends.
on
one
end
they're
saying
the
trial
judge
says,
merely
insufficient
evidence.
and
i
would
say,
and
my
argument
is
that
that
is,
when
you
say
it's
insufficient
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
you've
said
it
all.
but
then,
on
the
other
hand,
to
try
to
apply
the
no
evidence
rule
under
existing
louisiana
procedure,
and
say,
because
we
have
a
dichotomy
between
no
evidence
and
insufficient
evidence
that
we
are
not
going
to
apply,
in
essence,
the
burks
decision
of
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt,
as
in
re:
winship.
i
think
there,
from
both
ends,
that
their
premise
is
faulty.
and
i
would
assert
that
as
recently
as
1980,
may
of
1980,
the
court
of
louisiana,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
has
maintained
their
position,
and
that
is,
they
have
said
that
in
the
case
of...
if
i
may
have
a
drink
of
water.
in
may
of
1980,
in
the
state
v.
custard...
it's
the
state
court
of
louisiana,
they
stated
then
that
"this
court
has
yet
fully
to
embrace
jackson
v.
virginia.
"
and
that's
where
this
court,
i
think,
laid
to
rest
the
dichotomy
between
the
no
evidence
rule
and
the
application
of
the
rule
of
insufficient
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
adopted,
and
indeed
said
that
even
on
federal,
and
i
recognize
that
jackson
is
a
very
limited
opinion,
and
it's
limited
to
habeas
corpus
review
by
federal
district
judges.
now,
i
think
this
case
that
is
now
before
this
court
here
is
the
next
logical
sequence,
or
logical
step,
in
applying
that
standard
in
requiring
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifth
amendments
to
adhere
to
that
standard.
and
the
footnotes
in
this
case
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
fully
state
that
they
haven't
made
up
their
mind
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
follow
that
standard.
and
i
think
that's
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
give
direction
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
advise
them
that
they
will
have
to
embrace
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that
is
accurate;
yes,
sir.
i
would
not
claim
double
jeopardy.
let
me
get
to
my
section
here
and
make--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--it's
totally
in
the
brief.
i
think
the
wording
of
the
trial
judge
could
not
have
been
clearer
on
what
he
was
deciding
it
under.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
well,
the...
at
page
8a
of
the
appendix,
i
believe
it
is,
he
starts
out,
the
trial
judge
fixes
the
issue
himself.
he
says,
"i
believe
i'm
paraphrasing
those
grounds.
"
however,
"the
argument
was"--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
on
8a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
and
this
is
where
the
trial
judge
is
discussing
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
about
midway
down,
it
begins,
"the
argument
was,
however,
that
there
was
no
evidence
presented
that
would
have
justified
the
jury
in
finding
the
defendant
guilty
as
charged
because
there
was
no
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
the
jury
of
the
essential
elements
to
prove
the
essential
elements
of
the
crime.
"
so
he
fixed
the
issue
he
was
determining
it
on.
his
discussion
thereafter
discusses
that
basis
and
his
final
statement
is
precisely,
again,
on
it.
and
i...
perhaps
i'm
missing
the
direction
of
questioning,
but
i
really
feel
that
whether
he's
sitting
as
a
13th
juror
or
what,
at
a
point
in
time
where
a
reviewing
court,
whether
it
be
the
trial
judge
or
an
appellate
court,
cites
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
at
the
point
in
time
that
becomes
final,
i
believe
that
the
man
is
acquitted.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
takes
the
position
that
under
their
laws
that
exist,
they
cannot
review
a
decision
unless
there's
a
finding
of
no
evidence
at
all.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
at
this
point,
that
is
accurate.
but
if
this
court
were
to
require
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
adhere
to
the
standard
of
not
guilty
or
of
insufficient
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
it's
only
by
case
law
that
they
have
interpreted
into
their
cases
the
standard
of
no
evidence.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
sir.
well,
in
oklahoma...
that
might
be
accurate,
i
don't
know.
i
know,
in
oklahoma,
we
never
use
the
new
evidence
v.
the
insufficient
evidence
split.
in
other
words,
it's
strictly
and
always
has
been
whether
or
not
the
evidence
was
sufficient
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--no,
sir,
i
did
not.
in
fact,
i
was
not
retained
until
after,
or
brought
into
the
case
until
after
the
appeal.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
perhaps
i
am
confused
with
this
subparagraph
5--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--that's
correct.
if
he
had
strictly
relied
on
subparagraph
5,
then
i
would
say
i
would
not
be
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
would
say
that
that
would,
one,
that
they'd
have
to
determine,
and
i'm
not--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--no
double
jeopardy?
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
thought
that
was
the
question.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
in
subparagraph
5,
the
court
made
a
finding,
"it
is
of
the
opinion
the
ends
of
justice
would
be
better
served
by
granting
a
new
trial
although
defendant
may
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial
as
a
matter
of.
"
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--"may
not
be".
then
i
would
not
be
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
would
have
to
look
at
that
specific
statute,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
if
it
were
worded
similar
to
this,
that
double
jeopardy
would
not
be
an
issue
unless
it
were
used
as
a
subterfuge.
then
i
think
it
could
still
be
raised.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that's
correct.
if
the
defendant
moved
on,
if
he
specifically
said,
i
want
a
new
trial
on
number
five
then
yes,
i
totally
agree
with
you.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
if
the
trial
judge
concluded
that
there
was
no
evidence
at
all--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--i
think
the
test
often
is
what
the
finding,
the
ultimate
finding
of
the
court,
is.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
that's
what
i
would...
that
was
my
point
in
answering.
if
the
rule
5
grant
were,
in
my
words,
a
subterfuge,
or
actually
what
the
motion
was
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence,
then
i
don't
think
there
could
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
i
don't
ask
for
it
both
ways.
i
don't
ask;
this
is
not
my
role.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
what
i
say
is,
when
at
some
point,
when
the
judge
of
whatever
system
it
is,
in
this
case
the
state
of
louisiana,
when
the
judge
who
sits
on
the
issue
makes
his
finding
and
that
finding
becomes
final
through
either
appeal
or
lack
thereof,
that
that's
what
we
have
here
at
this
court
and
that
this
court
is
not
to
review
the
record.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
first
of
all,
i
would
take
exception,
and
i
do
take
exception,
to
justice
tate's
going
into
the
record
on
an
issue
of
law.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
it's
final.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
only
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
he
was
finding
no
evidence,
or
on
insufficient
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
if
he
is
willing
to
make
the
ruling
under
the
then
law...
as
he
did
in
this
case,
and
that
is
subject
to
appeal;
you
know,
it
couldn't
in
this
case
but
in
future
cases
it
could
be...
i
realize
that
louisiana
has
a
problem
right
now,
if
this
court
follows
my
ruling,
but
that's
louisiana's
problem
if
their
structure
is
not
in
line
with
the
u.s.
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
no,
sir.
burks
was
not
a
state
case.
i
recognize
that.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
not
in
louisiana,
i
don't
think,
because...
i
don't
know
that.
again,
louisiana's
been
using
the
no
evidence
versus
insufficient
evidence.
they've
been
saying,
unless
the
trial
judge
will
say
there's
no
evidence
of
either
the
crime
or
an
element
of
the
crime,
then
we
don't
review
it.
if
there
is...
however,
if
it's
merely
insufficient
evidence,
then
they
will
not
review
it.
only
if
there's
no
evidence.
and
that's
where
we...
you
know,
the
problem
of
review
in
louisiana
law
lies--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--i
think
he
should
apply
the
test
of
whether
or
not
that
any
trier
of
fact
could
find--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--could
reasonably
find.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
don't
read
that
into
justice
tate's
theory.
i
think
what
justice
tate
did
was,
he
did
not
like
what
the
trial
judge
said.
he
inserted
his
opinion.
let's
point
out
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
denied
the
appeal
from
the
trial
judge
is
sustaining
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
the
trial
judge
made
his
ruling
and
the
state
took
writs
and
the
writs
were
denied.
and
they
were
denied
because
of
this
louisiana
dichotomy.
then,
two
years
later,
tate
comes
behind...
or
justice
tate
goes
behind
that
and
says
he
examined
the
records
and
he's
speaking
for
himself
only,
not
the
majority
of
the
court.
he
says
that
we
would
have
affirmed,
but
he's
speaking
for
himself
only.
and
he's
going
behind
the
record
which,
i'm
told
time
and
time
again
i
can't
do,
when
i
come
on
appeal.
and
i
do
take
issue
with
that
in
the
concurrent
opinion;
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
it's
inconsistent
in
that
the
standard
applied
is
identical
to
the
standard
this
court
has
laid
down
in
in
re:
winship,
whereas
the
standard
where,
which
the
state
of
louisiana
is
saying
was
merely
insufficient
evidence,
is
identical
to
the
standard
that
this
court
has
laid
down
in
in
re:
winship
and
recognized
in
burks
and
later
in
jackson
v.
virginia.
and,
you
know,
if
they
can
say
the
same
words
and
say
they
mean
something
else,
then
i
would
concur
with
the
court,
with
you.
but
they're
not.
i
mean,
they're
using
the
same
words,
and
particularly
the
majority
of
the
court,
they're
using
the
exact
same
words
as
did
the
chief
justice
in
saying
they
mean
different
things.
and
i
can't
agree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
that's
semantics.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
would
like
to,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
they
will
be
very
brief,
indeed.
first
of
all,
i
think
if
this
court
looks
at
the
entire
opinion
of
the
trial
judge,
that
the
trial
judge...
here
is
where
i
take
issue
with
justice
tate...
in
no
way
does
the
trial
judge
in
any
way
state
anything
similar
to
the
fifth
provision
of
the
louisiana
code.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
he
certainly
did.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
certainly
think
he
did
and
i
specifically
refer
the
court
to
his
reasoning.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
well,
i
think
he
did.
because
he
went
on
to
quote--
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
the
majority
did,
yes.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
but
i...
you
know,
i
think
he
does
say
more
than
that,
and
in
fact
he
does
specifically
reference
three
of
the
other
grounds
and...
as
i
recall.
but
that's
in
the
appendix
for
the
court
to
read,
and
that
is,
certainly,
you
know,
where
he
ended
up.
but
i
would
point
out
that
at
the
time
that
the
trial...
at
the
pleadings...
we
had
it
today...
if
the
trial
judge
makes
a
ruling,
then
the
motion
for
retrial
on
grounds
of
insufficient
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
state
of
louisiana
is
in
the
same
position
it
was
then
unless
it
is
reversed
in
this
court.
and
that
is,
that
if
there
is
an
appeal
by
the
state
on
a
writ,
they'll
deny
it
because
they're
still
applying
the
no
evidence
test
and
saying,
we
can't
review
it
unless
there's
no
evidence.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that's
a
matter
of...
i
think
it
is
statute
by
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
that
is
correct.
they're
saying,
what
they're
saying
is,
it
doesn't
arrive
to
a
legal
issue
until
you
can
point
out
that
there's
no
evidence.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
they
could,
by
interpretation,
though.
see,
they've
interpreted...
they
themselves
have
interpreted
the
constitution
to
say
that.
in
other
words,
their
constitution
says
says
they
can
only
review
matters
of
law.
mr.
richard
o.
burst,
sr.
i
understand.
thank
you
very
much.
