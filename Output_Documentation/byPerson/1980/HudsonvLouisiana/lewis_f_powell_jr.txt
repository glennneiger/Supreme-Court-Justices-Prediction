justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
after
petitioner's
first
criminal
trial,
the
judge
granted
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
as
a
matter
of
law
was
insufficient
to
support
the
jury's
guilty
verdict.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
the
state
from
prosecuting
petitioner
a
second
time.
we
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
our
decision
rendered
two
times
ago
in
burks
against
the
united
states.
in
that
case,
an
appellate
court
had
concluded
that
the
states
evidence
was
legally
insufficient
to
support
a
guilty
verdict.
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
is
entitled
to
an
acquittal,
unless
the
state
presents
at
the
first
trial
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
verdict
or
judgment
guilty.
accordingly
in
burks,
we
held
that
there
could
be
no
retrial.
for
the
same
reason
we
hold
today,
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
retrial
of
petitioner.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
reversed.
