justice
white
but
then
you
defended...
after
the
second
trial
you
got
in
your
licks
on
whether
the
new
trial
order
was
right?
justice
white
then
he
appealed.
justice
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana's
rationale
for
its
decision?
are
you
just
asking,
or
not?
justice
white
under
burks
or
what?
justice
white
do
you
agree
with
him?
justice
white
shouldn't
we
remand
it,
then,
for
the
supreme
court
to
apply
the
right
standard
and
determine
whether
there
was
double
jeopardy?
justice
white
well,
if
you
agree
with
tate,
what
else
can
you
do
except
remand?
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
the...
are
you
saying?
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
judgment
cannot
stand
except
on
judge
tate's
theory?
justice
white
they
just
misread
burks,
you
think?
justice
white
or
do
you
agree
with
that,
or
not?
justice
white
and
you
hesitate
to
appear
before
them
after
having?
of
course,
even
judge
tate
isn't
there
anymore.
