justice
rehnquist
justice
dennis
begins
his
dissent
with
a
citation
to
burks,
does
he
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
take
our
state
procedure
and
state
procedural
remedies
as
we
find
them
in
this
court.
and
it
would
appear
to
me
that
from
justice
tate's
opinion
and
from
the
majority
opinion,
they
treat
the
motion
that
was
made
as
a
13th-juror
type
of
motion,
which
burks
left
open.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
would
have
to
disavow
justice
tate's
concurring
opinion,
wouldn't
you?
justice
rehnquist
but
justice
tate
had
been
a
member
of
that
court
for
many
years.
wouldn't
you
expect
him
to
have
known
that
if
that
were
in
fact
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
he
is
saying
that
what
the
trial
judge
did
is
to
say
that
the
question
the
trial
judge
answered
was
the
one
posed
by
justice
stevens
or
by
the
chief
justice.
but
there
was
not
enough
evidence
here
to
satisfy
me,
had
i
been
sitting
as
a
juror,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
rehnquist
but
he
granted
a
new
trial.
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
the
trial
judge
didn't
do
it
here,
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
didn't
do
it
here.
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
you
have
to
rely
on
the
trial
judge's
conclusion
to
support
your
hypothesis
that
when
a
judge
declares
that
no
reasonable
person
could
have
found
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
double
jeopardy,
because
certainly
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
of
49
other
states
too.
justice
rehnquist
presumably
the
double
jeopardy
requirements
since
benton
v.
maryland
have
been
the
same
for
purposes
of
state
and
federal
courts.
justice
rehnquist
could
a
defendant
after
the
receipt
of
a
guilty
verdict,
without
moving
for
a
new
trial,
appeal
his
conviction?
