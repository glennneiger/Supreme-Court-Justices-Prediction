justice
stewart
mr.
burst,
what
if
the
trial
judge
had
explicitly
relied
on
subsection,
subparagraph
5
of
article
851
in
granting
the
new
trial?
you
would
not
then
claim
that
there
was
denial
of?
justice
stewart
but
you
do
disavow
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
rehearing?
justice
stewart
well,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
that
his
statement
can
be
understood
to
mean
that
he
as
a
so
called
13th
juror
was
not
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
stewart
where
are
you
reading
now?
justice
stewart
okay.
justice
stewart
what
if
this
truly
were...
and
i
think
you
have
just
told
us
you
don't
think
there's
any
difference
if
it's
a
13th
juror
basis
on
which
a
new
trial
was
granted,
or
a
basis
of
a
finding
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
convince
any
reasonable
triers
of
fact
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
i
thought...
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
your
answer
to
my
question
when
i
asked
you
if
the
court
had,
the
trial
court
had
explicitly
relied
on
subparagraph
5?
justice
stewart
that
you
would
not
be
making
this
claim?
subparagraph
5
of
article
851.
justice
stewart
in
other
words,
one
can
imagine
a
state...
i
doubt
that
there
is
one,
but
there
may
be...
which
said
that
anybody
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense
in
a
trial
court
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
as
his
right,
just
to
entitle
them
to
two
bites
at
the
apple.
and
so
a
person
is
convicted
and
he
makes
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
he's
granted
a
new
trial.
there's
no
double
jeopardy
attached
to
that,
is
there?
justice
stewart
he
simply
relies
on
that
state
law
that
entitles
him
to
a
second
trial
if
he's
convicted
at
the
first
trial.
justice
stewart
none
at
all.
justice
stewart
and
wouldn't
the
same
thing
be
true
if
the
new
trial
were
granted
under
subparagraph
5?
justice
stewart
yes,
it
was.
and
i
thought
you
answered,
yes,
it
would
be.
justice
stewart
"may
not
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
"
justice
stewart
right.
or,
if
a
state...
and
some
states
do
do
this...
empower
the
trial
judge
to
grant
a
new
trial,
if
he,
the
trial
judge,
as
a
juror
sitting
in
the
box
was
not
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
defendant's
guilt,
regardless
of
any
finding
as
to
what
12
other
reasonable
men
might
have
been
convinced
of.
justice
stewart
well,
the
defendant
would
hardly
use
it
as
a
subterfuge.
justice
stewart
do
you
agree,
mr.
bullers,
that
at
the
time
of
this
trial
the
trial
judge
had
no
power
whatever
to
direct
a
judgment
of
acquittal?
justice
stewart
even
if
he
did
find
that
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever,
the
extent
of
his
power
was
to
grant
a
new
trial
as
a
matter
of
judgment
of
the
court.
justice
stewart
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
certainly
agreed
with
you.
justice
stewart
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
agreed
with
you.
justice
stewart
agreed
with
your
reading
of
what
the
trial
judge
says.
justice
stewart
rightly
or
wrongly.
justice
stewart
or
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
supreme
court
has,
never
reviews
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
i
gather.
justice
stewart
that's
a
matter
of
the
state
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
i
just
read
it
here;
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
no
power
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
stewart
if
they
say
that's
what
their
constitution
means,
that's
what
their
constitution
means,
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
we
can't
say
differently.
