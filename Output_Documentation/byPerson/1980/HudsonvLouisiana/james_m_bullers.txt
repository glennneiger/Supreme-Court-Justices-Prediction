mr.
james
m.
bullers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
agree
with
mr.
burst
that
this
really
is
limited
and
involves
interpretation
of
the
particular
statutes
that
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
has
dealing
with
new
trials.
the
state's
position
is
that
the
trial
judge,
when
he
made
the
comment,
he
said
that
"i
heard
the
same
evidence
the
jury
did.
"
then
he
went
on
to
say,
"i'm
convinced".
it
does
appear
somewhat
ambiguous,
of
course.
as
i
said,
the
state's
position
is
that
he
was
stating
his
opinion
after
he
had
heard
the
same
evidence
that
the
jury
heard.
now,
the
trial
judge
at
that
time
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
burks
and
jackson
v.
virginia.
the
problem
that
we
run
into
is
that
in
commenting
on
the
evidence
it
would
seem
to
the
state
that
the
best
answer
is,
what
does
the
record
really
reflect?
we
have
an
article
for
a
new
trial
which
deals
with
five
subsections,
and
though
the
judge
may
call
up
one
subsection
or
another,
he
could
be
in
error.
and
really,
it
does
appear
that
the
test
would
be,
what
does
the
record
really
reflect?
of
course,
the
state's
position
was,
we
agree
with
judge
tate
that,
although
because
the
trial
judge
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
burks
and
jackson,
he
didn't
articulate
particularly
and
he
did
not
assign
one
particular
subsection
or
another.
but
even
if
he
had,
isn't
it
really
what
the
record
reflects?
but
at
any
rate,
the...
in
the
supreme
court--
mr.
james
m.
bullers
--yes,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
do.
at
that
time--
mr.
james
m.
bullers
--yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
at
that
point,
that's
what
it
was.
that
particular
provision
for
directed
verdict
had
been
deleted
prior
to
this
trial,
so
that
in
essence
the
louisiana
legislature
had
taken
away
that
judge's
authority
to
interject
himself
into
the
jury
trial
process.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
yes.
that
remedy
would
be
to
take
an
appeal.
i
think
the
issue
comes
down
to
what
extent
should
the
trial
judge
interject
himself
or
be
required
to
interject
himself
into
the
trial
by
jury
process?
we
have
a
jury
of
12
peers
that
felt
the
evidence
was
sufficient
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
trial
judge
differed.
so,
the
only
way
that
i
could
see
logically
would
be
to
see
what
the
record
really
shows.
somebody...
obviously,
there's
a
difference
there;
that's
obvious.
but
the
key
is,
how...
to
what
extent
should
the
trial
judge
interject
himself
into
this
process?
should
he
be
required
to
evaluate
the
evidence
that
the
jury
hears
and
then
make
a
decision?
mr.
james
m.
bullers
pardon?
mr.
james
m.
bullers
well,
what
i
said
was--
mr.
james
m.
bullers
--interjected.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
no,
i
said,
what
i
meant
was,
to
what
extent
should
he
be
required
to
get
into
the
decision
process
when
you
have
a
jury
trial?
should
he
be
required
to
evaluate
the
evidence
and
to
what
extent
should
he
interject
himself
into
it?
i
didn't
say
he
did
in
this
case.
i'm
just
saying
this
is
what
it's
going
to
boil
down
to.
you
understand
as,
in
other
words,
in
the
future--
mr.
james
m.
bullers
--right.
in
the
future
the
procedure
that
we
have
now
just
says
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
then
you
have
a
right,
if
he's
found
guilty,
as
in
this
case,
then
he
can
take
an
appeal
or
ask
for
a
new
trial,
because
the
section
pertaining
to
directed
verdicts
was
deleted.
i
concede
that,
so
that
throughout
this
time
was
simply
to
raise
it
on
appeal
or
request
a
new
trial.
in
this
case
it
was
by
a
new
trial.
so
the
issue
would
be
in
the
future,
then,
to
what
extent
does
the
judge
have
to
evaluate
the
evidence
in
the
jury
process,
trial
by
jury
process?
i'm
not
saying
that
he
interjected
himself
in
it
in
this
case.
he
followed
the
law
that
since
he
didn't
have
the...
since
burks
had
not
been
rendered
at
that
time,
he
didn't
articulate
much
further.
he
just
had
the
one
little
paragraph
of...
one
little
excerpt
that
mr.
burst
talked
about,
and
that
was,
"i
heard
the
same
evidence
the
jury
did.
"
"i'm
convinced
that
it
doesn't
show.
"
et
cetera.
as
he
said,
"i'm
convinced".
mr.
james
m.
bullers
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
the
way
that
our
code
of
criminal
procedure,
article
778,
was
at
that
time,
it
would
only
be
by
trial
judge
alone,
of
course.
if
there
was
a
jury
trial,
it
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
no,
he
couldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
exactly.
he
would
have
to
grant
a
new
trial.
then
we
get
back
to,
did
he
grant
it
under
subsection
1,
which
was...
as
the
grounds
for
that
is
that
the
verdict
was
contrary
to
the
law
and
evidence,
or
was
it
some
other
grounds?
and
of
course,
justice
tate
in
his
opinion
felt
that
it
was
more
in
the
interest
of
justice.
the
state
from
our
point
of
view
gave
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
and
he
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
his
peers,
and
the
judge
said,
in
his
language,
"i'm
not
convinced"...
that's
our
interpretation
of
it...
and
granted
a
new
trial,
which
was
the
procedure
at
that
time,
that
was
his
remedy.
we
agree
to
that.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
no,
your
honor,
the
judge
didn't
state
that.
obviously,
judge
tate
in
his
reviewing
the
entire
case
felt
that's
what
it
was.
he
obviously
differed
in
the
opinion
of
the
judge...
that
when
the
judge
said
there
was
no
evidence
then
he
clarified
that
and
said,
at
least,
or
certainly
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
judge
tate
obviously
disagreed
with
that
because
he
said
he
felt
that
the
record
showed
sufficient
evidence
to
give
it
to
the
jury.
so
that,
in
his
opinion,
it
should
have
been
five
instead
of
one,
and
it
goes
back
to,
since
the
trial
judge
didn't
articulate,
and
even
if
he
had
it
still
seems
that
it's
actually
what
the
record
shows.
i
don't
see
any
other
way,
unfortunately.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
well,
it's
still
as
it
is
now,
is
my
understanding
also.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
there
would
be
a
finding
of
not
guilty
and
in
essence
it
would
bar
another
trial.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
do
you
have
any
other
questions?
mr.
james
m.
bullers
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
appeal
or
review
by
the
state,
once
the
judge
orders
a
new
trial
then
we'd
have
to
proceed
on
with
a
new
trial.
there
was
no
higher
court
to
review
what
had
gone
on
and
why,
and
to
make
a
ruling
whether
the
judge
was
right
or
wrong.
so
once
he
said
that
the
new
trial
should
be
held,
then
we'd
have
to
proceed
on
with
the
new
trial.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
well,
after
the
second
trial,
he
was
convicted
again.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
and
then
he
appealed
and
raised
this
issue.
and,
of
course,
his
position,
i
think,
was
that
we
get
another
bite
at
the
apple.
i'm
not
sure
that's
accurate,
of
course,
but
that
would
satisfy
the
jury.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
yes;
yes.
i
didn't
handle
the
trial.
the
record
shows
that
there
was
another
witness
that
was
not
available
or
not
found
that
didn't
testify
at
the
first
trial,
that
did
testify
at
the
second.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
i
think
that
judge
tate's
rationale
was
probably
the
most
accurate.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
yes,
sir.
i
think
that,
as
i
understand
burks,
it
would
be,
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
give
it
to
the
jury?
and
i
think
that
judge
tate
considered
that,
and
determined
that
there
was.
but
of
course,
he
had
to
look
at
the
record
to
determine
that,
obviously.
he
had
to
know
what
the
evidence
was.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
yes,
i
do.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
that
is
a
possibility.
as
i
understand
the
majority
opinion,
what
they
were
saying
was
that--
mr.
james
m.
bullers
--his
theory,
as
i
said,
appears
to
be
the
most
accurate.
the
majority
opinion,
i
think,
when
they
were
sorting
through
burks
and
applying
it
here,
got
into
a
difficult
position.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
well--
mr.
james
m.
bullers
--of
course,
that
is
our
supreme
court,
and
those
are
learned
gentlemen
down
there,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
bullers
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he's
with
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
now.
but
if
it
does
come
down
to
the
fact
that
this
constitutes
double
jeopardy,
then
i
think
that
as
you
read
our
statutes,
then,
article
851,
which
sets
out
the
various
subdivisions,
the
judge
is
going
to
have
to
articulate
particularly
which
one
and
why.
and
as
i
said,
the
trial
judge
didn't
have
that
benefit
at
the
time.
so
that's
why
we're
sort
of
at
a
loss
here.
i
think
that
puts
us
in
a
difficult
position.
i
think
that's
true
of
the
appellant
as
well
as
the
state.
does
the
court
have
any
other
questions?
