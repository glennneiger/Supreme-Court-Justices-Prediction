chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
hudson
v.
louisiana.
mr.
burst.
chief
justice
burger
well,
wasn't
he
saying
in
the
alternative
i
see
no
evidence
whatever,
but
if
i'm
wrong
on
that
then
my
fallback
position
is,
there
was
not
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
burger
did
they
have
authority
to
enter
a
judgment
notwithstanding
verdict
at
that
time?
chief
justice
burger
well,
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
couldn't
the
judge
at
the
end
of
the
trial
have
said
what
he
said
to
himself
here,
and
therefore
i
am
entering
judgment
for
the
defendant
of
acquittal
notwithstanding
the
verdict?
could
he
do
that
at
that
time?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
that
a
statute
which
required
a
judge
to
submit
this
question
to
the
jury
when
there
was
in
fact
no
evidence,
would
in
itself
be
unconstitutional.
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
burger
you
have
to
treat
his
statement,
then,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
as
a
statement
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
reasonably
find
guilt
on
the
evidence,
don't
you?
chief
justice
burger
well,
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
for
error
in
the
admission
or
rejection
of
evidence,
is
there
a
waiver
of
any
double
jeopardy
claimed
there?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
conceded
that
the
judge's
comment
was
somewhat
ambiguous,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
pursue
that
with
one
more
question.
are
you
telling
us
that
whenever
a
judge,
a
trial
judge...
forget
the
old
louisiana
statute...
any
trial
judge,
who
disagrees
with
the
jury's
verdict
of
guilt
because
as
a
juror
he
would
have
voted
the
other
way,
then,
that
gives
rise
to
a
double
jeopardy
problem?
chief
justice
burger
just
because
he
disagrees?
chief
justice
burger
but
xx
only
one
question,
namely,
that
the
evidence
does
not
support
the
verdict
with
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
then,
what
is
the
test?
if
there's
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
that
ground,
what's
the
test
that
the
trial
judge
should
apply?
chief
justice
burger
could
reasonably
find?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
that's
justice
tate's...
it
would
follow
justice
tate's
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
wish
to
save
any
time
for
rebuttal,
you
have
your--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--mr.
bullers.
chief
justice
burger
then
the
state
has
no
appeal
from
an
order
granting
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
not.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
burst?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
burger
but
did
he
say
any
more
than
that,
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
jury,
he
would
have
voted
the
other
way?
chief
justice
burger
oh,
you
think
so?
chief
justice
burger
but
an
experienced
trial
judge
should
have
articulated
it
more
precisely
if
he
meant
what
you
say
he
meant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
hudson
against
louisiana
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren

you,
