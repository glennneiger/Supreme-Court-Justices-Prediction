justice
stevens
mr.
burst,
isn't
that
even
ambiguous,
because
can't
one
read
that
to
mean,
either
not
sufficient
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
have
no
reasonable
doubt,
on
the
basis
of
which
a
jury
could
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
not
sufficient
evidence
to
convince
me,
the
judge,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
you
could
read
it
either
way,
couldn't
you?
justice
stevens
well,
which
way
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
he
doesn't
think
there's
enough
evidence
to
convince
him
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
not
enough
to
have
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
if
he
means
the
latter
why
did
he
submit
it
to
the
jury?
justice
stevens
unless,
in
fact,
there
were
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
guilt.
say
the
judge
just
put
it
on
section
5,
but
then
the
defendant
argued,
well,
he
granted
it
for
that
reason,
but
they
didn't
offer
any
evidence
of
guilt
at
all,
and
on
review
of
the
record
you
concluded
that
was
right.
could
there
be
a
new
trial?
justice
stevens
he
doesn't
conclude
anything.
the
trial
judge
says,
i'm
going
to
grant
a
section
5
new
trial;
in
the
interest
of
justice,
i
wasn't
persuaded.
but
supposing
a
federal
judge
looking
at
the
case
later
or
the
reviewing
court
finds
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
guilt
in
the
record
at
all;
they
didn't
even
put
a
witness
on
the
stand.
could
he
be
retried?
is
the
test
what
the
record
shows
or
what
the
judge
says?
justice
stevens
you
mean,
if
the
judge
says,
it's
a
new
trial
under
section
5
in
the
interests
of
justice,
there
could
be
a
new
trial,
even
if
the
state
put
in
no
evidence
of
guilt
at
all,
didn't
put
a
single
witness
on
the
stand?
justice
stevens
so
the
test
is
what
the
record
shows,
not
what
the
judge
says?
and
it's
up
to
this
court
to
independently
examine
the
record,
is
that
it?
justice
stevens
well,
what
did
you
say?
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
stevens
well,
what
do
you
say?
is
it
what
the
judge
says
or
what
the
record
says?
justice
stevens
no,
but
what
if
his
finding
is,
i'm
granting
this
motion
under
section
5
in
the
interest
of
justice.
is
there
always
permitted
to
be
a
new
trial?
you
see,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is,
here
he
used
the
language
you
like.
there's
no
evidence.
but
justice
tate
said,
no,
but
i've
looked
at
the
record
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
was
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury.
do
you
agree
with
justice
tate
when
he
says
that?
he
doesn't
turn
on
what
the
judge
says.
he
says
there
was
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand.
your
opinion
is,
we
just
look
at
what
the
trial
judge
says
and
we
don't
pay
any
attention
to
the
record.
justice
stevens
well,
but
his
opinion
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
the
first
time
around
in
refusing
to
reverse
the
order
granting
a
new
trial,
because
his
theory
of
the
order
granting
a
new
trial
was
that
there
was
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
but
that
the
interests
of
justice
made
it
appropriate
to
grant
a
new
trial.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
his
view
in
affirming
the...
in
other
words,
he
says
the
order
was
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
bullers,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
louisiana
procedure?
as
i
understand
it,
you've
just
confirmed
he
could
not
have
granted
a
judgment
of
not
guilty
notwithstanding
the
verdict
of
the
jury?
justice
stevens
and
he
also
had
a
duty
in
advance
of...
he
had
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury
even
if
he
thought
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
stevens
and
what
about
at
the
end
of
the
prosecutor's
case,
could
he
have
granted
directed
verdict
at
that
point
in
the
proceeding?
justice
stevens
so
if
he
thought
there
was
no
evidence
of
guilt
and
that
there'd
been
a
total
failure
of
proof,
he
would
have
had
to
do
exactly
what
he
did
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
record
that
supports
judge
tate's
view
that...
and
i
know
he's
an
awfully
good
judge
and
usually
is
pretty
careful
about
what
he
does...
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
support
his
view
that
the
judge
relied
on
section
five?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
status
of
your
procedure
now?
is
there
an
option
open
to
the
judge
to
grant
a
directed
verdict
notwithstanding--
justice
stevens
--it's
still
the
same
way?
justice
stevens
if
your
procedure
allowed
a
directed
verdict,
and
the
district
and
the
trial
judge
entered
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
notwithstanding
the
judgment,
would
you
say
that
would
bar
another
trial?
that
would
clearly
bar
another
trial,
even
if
there
was
a--
justice
stevens
--so
we
just
look
at
the
judge's
ruling
in
that
case,
and
we
wouldn't
really
look
at
the
evidence
at
all?
that's
right.
