we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
chicago
and
north
western
v.
kalo
brick
&
tile.
mr.
johnson,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rush.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
a
form
of
review,
in
a
sense,
of
the
commission's
action?
judicial
review
by
a
state
court?
chief
justice
burger
it
has
the
same
consequence,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
as
though
they
were
reviewing
you
and
the
commission
and
reversing
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blackburn.
chief
justice
burger
by
that
you
mean
that
it
would
go
to
the
state
courts
first?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
abandonment
of
an
interstate
line?
chief
justice
burger
but
suppose
you're
contemplating
building
this
plant,
no
plant
is
there,
so
you
build
a
plant
there.
could
the
state
courts
of
iowa
compel
service
to
that
plant?
chief
justice
burger
no,
that's
hypothetical.
chief
justice
burger
obviously
not
an
issue
here.
chief
justice
burger
but
once
the
service
is
available,
it
must
be
maintained?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
else...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow.
what
else
would
there
be
besides
the
track
and
the
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
chicago
&
north
western
transportation
company
against
kalo
brick
&
tile,
it
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
