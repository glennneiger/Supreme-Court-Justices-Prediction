mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
an
affirmance
of
the
iowa
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
would
not
do
violence
to
the
railroad
industry,
nor
would
it
do
violence
to
the
federal
scheme
for
regulating
the
industry
or
to
national
transportation
policy.
instead,
your
honors,
we
submit
that
it
would
cause
railroads
to
make
early
decisions
about
abandonment
plans.
we
also
submit
that
it
would
avoid
the
practice--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--yes,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
show
that
the
railroad
was
neglected
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
ultimately
failed
because
of
that
neglect.
if
the
transportation
company
had
made
an
early
decision
to
abandon
that
line,
the
kalo
brick
and
tile
company
which
is
now
out
of
business
could
have
made
management
decisions
about
relocation
or
could
have
made
management
decisions
about
merger
with
other
companies.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
that
is
going
to
be
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
right.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
no,
we
would
not
claim
that
at
all.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
right.
at
least
the
track
must
be
maintained,
and
the
car
service
must
be
maintained
under
the
iowa
statutes.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
well,
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
those
state
statutes
do
impose
duties
upon
the
railroad.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
right.
we
would
also
suggest,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be,
it
would
avoid
the
kind...
railroad
and
the
amicus
in
this
case
discussed
somewhat
obliquely
the
unreasonable
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
reverse
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
by
the
action,
the
unilateral
neglect,
the
unilateral
abandonment
that
the
chicago
north
western
has
taken,
and
we
would
also
suggest
that
an
affirmance
of
the
iowa
court
of
appeals
would
have
a
tendency
to
stabilize
the
railroad
industry
by
striking
a
balance
between
the
carrier,
between
the
shipper
and
between
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
we
suggest,
your
honors,
that
the
fault,
or
the
problem
with
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
is
simple.
it
was
pointed
out
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
case
of
pan
american
oil
company
v.
superior
court
about
20
years
ago,
and
that
is
this,
that
a
party
who
brings
the
suit
is
the
master
to
decide
what
law
he
will
rely
upon.
and
in
the
district
court
of
iowa,
the
kalo
brick
&
tile
company
relied
upon
three
theories.
the
first
was
failure
to
provide
car
service
upon
reasonable
notice
and
within
reasonable
time,
pursuant
to
iowa
statute
479.3.
the
second
and
the
most
important
one
to
the
issues
here,
is
the
fact
that
kalo
pled
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
the
negligence
of
the
railroad
and
its
employees,
a
state
statute.
and
that
statute,
i've
pointed
it
out
here
and
i
don't
like
to
take
a
lot
of
time
reading,
but
it
says,--
"every
corporation
operating
a
railroad
shall
be
liable
for
all
damages
sustained
by
any
person
in
the
consequences
of
the
acts
of
the
agents.
"
there
is
also
a
third,
kind
of
a
throwaway
issue
and
that
is,
interference
with
prospective
business
advantage
or
business
relationships.
now,
both
the
railroad
and
the
amicus
before
this
court
have
characterized
this
case
as
either,
number
one,
a
car
service
case,
or
number
two,
an
abandonment
case.
and
they
have
conveniently
for
purposes
which
are
obvious
to
this
decision,
have
avoided
discussing
either
in
their
briefs
or
in
argument
the
question
of
the
iowa
negligence
statute,
which
is
479.122.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
your
honor,
we
do
not
contend...
and
here
is
where
the
amicus
and
the
railroad
and
we
are
in
agreement...
we
disagree,
we
do
not
disagree
with
very
much
of
what
they
said.
we
simply
say,
what
they
say
does
not
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
my
answer
is,
no.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
does
provide
for
provisions
for
abandonment
and
has
language
to
the
effect.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
well,
we
would
suggest
they
could,
but
then
they
would
subject
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
iowa
court
if
they
carelessly
abandoned.
we
say
that
is
this
case.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
under...
the
duty
arises
under
the
statute
that
provides--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--no,
i
do
not...
i
do
not
think
that
would
isolate
them
from
liability,
if
that's
what
your
question
is.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
well,
maybe
i
misspoke
myself,
your
honor.
i
may
have--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
intended
to
say,
yes,
if
that
was
the
question.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
whether
they
were
negligent
or
not,
yes.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
and
that
is
based
upon...
and
this
is
an
issue
that
goes
to...
when
this
case
was
first
started
plaintiff's
attorneys
relied
upon
three
united
states
supreme
court
decisions
and
three
iowa
supreme
court
decisions
and
a
decision
of
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
establishing
state
court
jurisdiction.
and
to
our
knowledge
those
cases,
none
of
them,
have
ever
been
overruled.
it
is
also
important,
your
honors,
to
find,
to
note,
we
feel,
to
this
issue,
that
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
railroad,
the
imponding
of
the
water
was
a
factor
in
the
failure
of
this
railroad,
and
that
the
permitting
ponded
water
to
stand
was
not
good
maintenance
practice.
that's
noted
at
appendix,
page
16a.
i
don't
want
to
burden
the
court
with
facts,
but
i
think
the
chronology
of
these--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
we
think
those
cases
are
all
cases
involving
regulation
and
not
remedy,
and
the
amicus
disparages
our
attempt
to
distinguish
between
the
remedial
effect
as
opposed
to
the
regulatory
effect
of
a
regulatory
scheme.
and
your
honor,
we
suggest
this,
that...
and
it
might
be
somewhat
trite
to
suggest
that
the
regulatory
scheme
falls
basically
within
what
we've
known
as
the
police
power,
whereas
the
remedies
involve
suits
between
parties.
and
so
therefore
we
think
that
there
is
a
great
distinction
in
those
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
well,
your
honor--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--we
simply
suggest
that
the
colorado
case
was
a
regulatory
case
and
most
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
amicus
and
the
chicago
north
western
are
cases
which
are
apposite
to
this
case.
they
are
cases
involving
discrimination,
they
are
cases
involving
reparations,
they
are
cases
involving
national
transportation
policy,
they
are
cases
which
involve
any
number
of
things
which
are
not
within
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
well,
that
again,
your
honor,
is
a
nice
statement
but
taken...
it's
in
the
case
itself,
it's
stated
somewhat
hypothetically
without
reference
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
we
have
no
argument
with
the
suggestion
of
the
amicus
or
the
chicago
north
western
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
such
things
as
rates,
over
such
things
as
abandonments,
over
such
things
as
rate
discrimination,
discrimination
against
the
furnishing
of
cars.
but
our
approach
is
fairly
narrow
in
that
it
arises
basically
under
an
iowa
negligence
statute
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
national
transportation
policy,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
intercession
of
administrative
expertise,
and
it
has
none
of
the
rubric
of
your
ordinary
regulation-type
case.
the
facts:
basically,
the
kalo
brick
&
tile
company
which
was
a
family
business,
been
in
business
for
almost
a
hundred
years,
had
been
served
for
75
years
by
this
same
rail
line,
had
been
served
very
well
until
1960
when
the
chicago
north
western
took
it
over.
during
the
'60s,
not
only
did
the
track
begin
to
fail,
but
kalo
was
not
getting
the
switches,
kalo
was
not
getting
adequate
cars...
they
were
getting
bad
cars,
they
were
getting
all
sorts
of
poor
service.
they
were
promised
better
service
but
it
never
came.
and
so,
consequently,
through
that
period
of
time
they
were
led
to
believe
that
things
will
be
better,
but
they
never
got
better.
now,
the
court
is
obviously
aware
that
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
the
railroad
was
because
of
imponding
water
along
the
side
of
the
tracks.
in
april
of
'73
the
track
became
impassable,
and
then
in
august.
kalo
because
it
required
railroad
transportation
to
be
competitive
in
its
business,
sold
its
assets
and
went
out
of
business.
and
it
wasn't
until
three
months
after
that,
that
finally
the
application
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
was
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
our
point,
going
back
again
to
the
iowa
negligence
statute,
is
this:
that
tort
became,
that
state
court
tort
action
became
complete
on
the
day
when
the
damage
existed.
and
i
think
that's
general
negligence
law.
so
the
negligence,
and
the
damages,
if
any,
were
established
in
august,
quite
a
bit
of
time
prior
to
the
time
that
the
railroad
made
application
for
abandonment.
now,
we
submit,
your
honors--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--there
was,
your
honor,
yes,
a
short
period
of
time
when
alternate
facilities
were
offered
by
truck
to
the
landing
dock,
to
the
railhead,
or
whatever,
but
that
simply
did
not
work
out.
i
think
that--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--and
i
think
physically
it
does
not
work
out,
because
you
get
a
certain
amount
of
jiggling
and
there's
a
special
way
of
packing
bricks,
as
i
understand
it,
and
loading
and
unloading
and
so
forth.
we
submit
that
it
was
not...
no
matter
what
might
be
said
about
the
preemption
statutes,
and
the
cases
that
interpret,
we
simply
say
that
it
was
not
the
clear
and
manifest
purpose
of
congress
to
preempt
the
state
court
duty
to
exercise
reasonable
care,
or
to
take
any
cumulative
remedies
in
the
state
car
service
statutes.
the
negative
intent
of
the
congressional
act
is
manifest
in
several
ways.
number
one,
throughout
the
esch
car
service
statute,
and
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
congress
felt
it
right
to
leave
intact
sections
8,
9,
and
22
of
that
act,
which
are
the
very
sections
relied
upon
in
puritan
coal.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
and
in
the
appendix.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
your
honor--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--therein
lies
the
distinction.
we
do
not
claim
that
there
was
negligent
abandonment.
we
claim
that
there
was
negligent
maintenance
of
the
track
which
ultimately
caused
abandonment.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
yes.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
yes.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
let
me
rephrase
that.
i'm
sorry
i
preempted
the
question.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
i
think
negligence
law
is
general
law.
it
commences
from
the
duty
to
exercise
reasonable
care.
it's
basically
hornbook
law.
it
does
not
vary
that
much
from
state
to
state.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
if
possibly
could.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
i
agree
it--
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
it
gives
me
no
problem
to
this
extent,
that
i
think
it
creates
a...
let
me
analogize
to
another
area
of
modern
tort
law.
the
emergence
in
the
last
20
years
or
25
years
of
products
liability
litigation
has
caused
manufacturers
to
recognize
their
duties
and
their
obligations
to
the
consumers.
now,
i
don't
think
there
are
very
many
people
except
perhaps
some
manufacturers
who
would
not
say
that
that
has
a
salutary
and
good
effect.
and
i
think
the
same
thing
would
happen
in
this
kind
of
case.
the
railroads
in
this
case,
i
think,
in
this
country,
i
think
everyone
would
admit
are
in
bad
condition.
we've
had
a
regulatory
scheme
since
1887
which
has
not
cured
those
conditions.
now,
we're
simply
saying
that
the
state
tort
claim
would
put
the
presence
on
the
railroads
to
make
those
decisions
rather
than
to
let
the
railroads
fall
by
neglect
and
what
we
term
abandonment
by
neglect.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i'm
simply
saying
that
that's
an
analogy
that
the
products
liability
cases
have
caused
manufacturers
to
recognize
their
duties.
mr.
m.
gene
blackburn
except,
your
honor,
that
we're
saying
that
the
way
this
case
is
pleaded
it's
not
pleaded
within
those
federal
guidelines.
the
case
was
pleaded
as
a
state
court
case.
i
think
the
best
case
in
support
of
our
theory,
and
it
doesn't
get
to
the
question
of
primary
jurisdiction
or
preemption,
is
the
case
of
johnson
against
chicago,
milwaukee,
and
st.
paul,
out
of
the
9th
circuit,
which
is
a
diversity
case.
and
the
court
reached
some
of
these
issues
that
we're
talking
about
here.
in
any
event,
section
22
of
the
act
preserves
to
the
states,
preserves
in
clear
and
unqualified
language,
existing
remedies.
and
states,
the
remedies
provided
for
in
this
subtitle
are
in
addition
to
remedies
existing
under
another
law
or
at
common
law.
and
that
is
in
the
1978
recodification
to
the
transportation
act,
and
it's
significant
to
note
that
that
section
which
is
101.03
was
given
its
separate
place,
and
it
was
taken
out
of
a
rate
section,
which
was
22,
which
defined
rates,
and
it
was
given
special
emphasis
by
giving
it
a
special
section.
we
also
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
law
as
pronounced
by
this
court
in
the
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
jones
v.
rath
packing
company,
is
that
there
is
an
assumption
against
preemption,
particularly
unless
there
is
a
clear
and
manifest
purpose
otherwise.
we
suggest
also
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
state
law
remedies
or
any
federal
or
regulatory
scheme.
one
of
the
questions
that
was
posed
in
opposing
counsel's
discussion
i
think
can
be
answered
in
this
way.
under
kalo's
theory
of
negligent
track
maintenance
and
granted
it's
a
narrow
theory,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
in
federal
court
or
before
the
commission.
we
do
not
contend
that
there
is.
there
are
no
federal
track
maintenance
standards.
the
only
way
that
kalo
could
get
into
federal
court
would
be,
under
this
theory,
would
be
via
diversity
action,
which
would
call
upon
the
district
court
to
grant
original
jurisdiction.
any
claim...
and
we
concede...
any
claim
that
is
made
under
the
act
must
be
made
through
the
commission,
and
then
referred
to
the
federal
court,
or
if
it's
brought
in
federal
court,
i
would
agree
with
the
question
that
was
previously
asked
that
it
probably
must
be
referred
to
the
commission.
but
that
overlooks
our
theory
of
the
case.
our
theory,
the
federal
act,
the
federal
interstate
commerce
act,
does
not
encompass
negligent
track
maintenance.
our
theory
is
narrow
but
it's
viable
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
we
know
of
no
case
which
overrules
the
puritan
case.
it's
never
been
expressly
overruled,
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
that
it
did
not
favor
implied
overruling
of
cases.
but
in
any
event
our
theory
is
based
upon
negligent
track
maintenance
and
there's
nothing
about
that
theory
which
imposes
or
incites
a
federal
rule
or
a
federal
statute.
now,
one
of
the
theories
that
the
railroad
would
have
us
follow
is,
if
you're
is,
harmed,
you
seek
injunction.
well,
your
honors,
in
this
case,
injunction
was
not
an
adequate
remedy.
it
would
be
foolish
for
the
kalo
people
to
spend
their
then
inadequate
resources
to
enjoin
the
abandonment
of
a
railroad
that
had
already
failed,
and
for
which
they'd
been
told
that
it
wasn't
going
to
be
rebuilt.
but
the
injunction
theory,
which
they
would
have
us
follow,
is
a
very
narrow
theory.
under
the
8th
circuit
decisions
which
are
cited
in,
i
think,
both
briefs,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
v.
the
chicago
north
western,
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
v.
chicago,
rock
island,
&
pacific,
the
chicago,
rock
island,
&
pacific
case
indicated
that
the
only
question
before
in
that
proceeding
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
illegal
abandonment.
well,
at
that
point
of
the
proceedings,
kalo
was
out
of
business
and
had
no
incentive
to
proceed
further
by
injunction.
likewise,
those
issues,
of
course,
go
to
the
question
of
the
primary
jurisdiction.
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
no
primary
jurisdiction...
in
other
words,
if
this
does
not
involve
questions
of
national
transportation
policy,
if
it
does
not
require
the
administrative
expertise
to
solve
this
problem,
if
it
is
of
a
kind
of
problem
that
can
be
handled
by
the
conventional
wisdom
of
judges,
then
the
icc
has
no
primary
jurisdiction,
unless
it's
found
somewhere
else
within
the
statute.
and
under
our
theory,
once
again,
we'd
say
it's
not
found
anywhere
else
in
the
statute.
so
if
there
is
no
primary
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
collateral
estoppel.
and
there
are
other
reasons
for
denying
collateral
estoppel
in
this
case.
first,
there
are
policy
reasons.
the
issues
are
not
the
same.
the
issue
before
the
commission
was
limited
to
one
thing:
was
the
railroad
entitled
to
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
which
would
permit
it
to
abandon
the
line?
the
issues
before
the
state
court
were
negligence,
car
service
issues,
and
with
the
defense
that
the
failure
of
the
road
was
an
act
of
god,
which
i
think
is
rather
interesting.
because
under
iowa
law
and
under
law
generally,
and
this
is
also
cited
in
the
9th
circuit
case
of
johnson
v.
chicago,
milwaukee,
in
order
for
a
defense
in
a
civil
suit,
the
extents
of
acts
of
god
in
a
civil
suit
to
be
a
defense,
it
must
be
the
sole
proximate
cause.
now,
kalo...
another
reason
for
denying
collateral
estoppel
in
this
case
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
this:
kalo
had
no
incentive
to
go
to
washington
to
be
involved
in
those
proceedings.
it
was
out
of
business.
this
court
also
announced
the
fairness
doctrine
in
the
parklane
hosiery
case,
and
we
call
your
specific
attention
to
note
15
of
that
case,
which
sets
forth
the
fact
that
it
may
often
times
be
unfair
to
call
a
party
out
of
and
come
to
a
foreign
forum
to
litigate
issues
which
are
beyond
the
reach
of
its
own
discovery
procedures
and
so
forth.
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
general
rule
of
the
restatement
of
judgments
which
is
now
in
a
tentative
draft
fourth
edition,
which
says,
in
the
case
of
a
judgment
entered
without
contest
by
concession,
consent,
or
default,
none
of
the
issues
is
actually
litigated.
"therefore
the
rule
of
this
section
does
not
apply
with
respect
to
any
issue
in
a
subsequent
action.
"
finally,
your
honors,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
collateral
estoppel
or
res
judicata
or
issue
preclusion,
we
suggest
that...
and
writers
have
suggested
that
there
is
a
general
fear
that
overuse
of
issue
preclusion
will
cause
litigants
to
overtry
their
cases
and
therefore
you
get
a
reverse-adverse
effect,
because
the
reason
for
the
collateral
estoppel
rule
in
the
first
place
is
to
preserve
the
judicial
economy
and
not
extend
it.
also,
your
honors,
i
would
suggest
that
collateral
estoppel
should
never
be
used
as
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
once
again,
your
honors,
we
would
suggest
that
an
affirmance
of
the
iowa
court
of
appeals
would
provide
a
check
against
abandonment
by
neglect,
and
a
balancing
process
between
the
regulated,
the
regulator,
and
the
public.
we
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors,
and
it's
been
an
honor
to
be
here.
