justice
stevens
mr.
johnson,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
this
argument
based
on
the
absence
of
any
state
law
duty
is
equally
strong
if
there
had
been
no
abandonment
proceeding?
you
don't
rely
on
the
abandonment
proceeding
in
connection
with
this
argument?
justice
stevens
mr.
blackburn,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
negligence
theory?
justice
stevens
assume
that
the
railroad
was
losing
money
on
this
line
and
they
went
in
before
the
icc
and
got
an
abandonment
on
economic
grounds
that
it's
a
loss
operation
and
it's
not
necessary
to
maintain
the
public
interest
and
the
icc
gave
permission.
would
there
have
been
any
duty
under
iowa
law
to
continue
to
operate?
justice
stevens
your
answer
is,
no,
i
take
it?
justice
stevens
well,
if
there's
no
duty
in
that
case,
they
can
willfully
abandon.
why
can't
they
negligently
abandon?
justice
stevens
but
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
iowa
law.
i'm
assuming
they
comply
with
federal
law
in
either
case,
and
i'm
asking
you,
as
a
matter
of
iowa
law,
if
they
can
willfully
abandon,
why
can't
they
carelessly
abandon?
it
would...
that's
reaching
the
same
duty,
i
would
think.
justice
stevens
but
if
they
don't
have
a
duty
to
refrain
from
willful
abandonment,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
duty
to
refrain
from
negligent
abandonment?
justice
stevens
well,
would
they
have
a
defense
to
your
action
if
they
filed
an
answer
and
said,
we
didn't
do
this
negligently,
we
planned
it
five
years
ago.
we
let
the
ponds
develop
and
we
were
doing
it
because
we
intended
to
abandon.
it's
exactly
what
our
corporate
objective
was.
justice
stevens
but
you
seem
to
acknowledge
there'd
be
no
cause
of
action
if
it
were
willful,
but
there
is
a
cause
of
action
if
it's
negligent.
justice
stevens
my
first
question
is,
assume
no
negligence
but
merely
a
corporate
plan,
let's
abandon
this
line
because
we're
not
making
any
money.
and
i'd
ask
you,
would
that
violate
any
iowa
duty?
and
i
thought
you
said,
no.
justice
stevens
so
then
your
claim
does
not
really
depend...
your
duty
exists
whether
they
were
negligent
or
not?
