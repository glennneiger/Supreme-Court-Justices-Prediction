mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
state
law
damage
action
commenced
in
state
court
in
iowa
because
of
damages
allegedly
sustained
due
to
the
cessation
of
interstate
transportation
service
over
the
railroad's
line
serving
the
respondent's
factory.
the
issues
are
as
follows.
first,
have
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
preempted
state
court
damage
actions
founded
on
state
law
in
the
areas
of
provision
of
interstate
transportation
service
that
are
involved
in
the
facts
of
this
case?
secondly,
has
an
earlier
ruling
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
precluded
the
respondent
from
relitigating
issues
that
are
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
respondent's
state
law
damage
claims?
prior
to
entry
of
the
judgment
of
the
iowa
trial
court,
the
commerce
commission
ruled
that
the
cessation
of
interstate
service
over
the
railroad's
line
was
caused
by
conditions
that
were
beyond
the
control
of
the
railroad,
and
the
railroad's
issue
preclusion
defense
contends
that
in
order
for
the
respondent's
state
law
theories
to
be
sustained
the
respondent
would
have
to
obtain
an
iowa
trial
court
ruling
that
the
conditions
that
led
to
the
cessation
of
service
were
in
fact
within
the
control,
or
could
have
been
prevented
by
the
railroad.
secondly--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--the
icc
proceeding
was
an
abandonment
application.
the
railroad
filed
an
application
to
receive
permission
from
the
commerce
commission
to
abandon
its
trackage.
the
railroad's
abandonment
application
was
filed
after
the
respondent
had
decided
to
go
out
of
business
and
after
the
respondent
had
ceased
operating
his
business.
the
railroad
then
filed
an
application
for
permission
to
abandon,
and
a
year
and
half
after
service
ceased
over
the
trackage,
the
respondent
filed
an
action
in
state
court
seeking
damages
grounded
on
state
law
theories.
this
case
involves
the
supremacy
clause,
it
involves
interstate
commerce
provisions
which
require
interstate
carriers
to
provide
interstate
service,
transportation
service;
commerce
act
provisions
which
require
interstate
carriers
to
provide
interstate
car
service;
it
involves
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
regulate
the
abandonment
and
extension
of
lines,
and
also
the
provisions
of
the
commerce
act
that
entitle
a
shipper
to
commence
an
action
for
damages
either
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
in
federal
district
court
where
they
can
prove
a
violation
of
the
commerce
act
on
the
part
of
interstate
carrier.
kalo
did
not
commence
its
action
before
the
commission
or
in
federal
district
court.
instead,
it
went
to
state
court
and
seeks
damages
under
a
state
car
service
theory,
a
state
car
service
statute,
a
state
negligence
statute,
and
common
law
tortious
interference.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
section
9
would
permit
a
damage
action
to
be
filed
before
the
commission
or
in
federal
district
court.
if
a
damage
action
were
filed
in
federal
district
court,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
think
that
the
federal
district
court
would
stay
the
action
and
refer
the
issue
of
causation
of
cessation
of
service
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
no,
because,
if
you
look
at--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--no,
you
could
not
file
an
action
claiming
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
state
court.
and
here
is
the
reason.
the
commerce
act
has
been
construed
in
puritan,
among
others,
which
is
a
case
relied
upon
by
the
respondent...
it's
been
construed
to
restrict
section
9
damage
actions
to
the
forums
set
cut
in
section
9,
which
are
the
commerce
commission
and
federal
district
court.
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
doing
that.
first
of
all,
if
you
restrict
it
to
federal
district
court
or
the
commerce
commission,
you
are
going
to
have
one
system
of
federal
law
which
is
going
to
govern
damage
actions
as
well
as
the
other
regulatory
functions
of
the
commission.
however,
if
you
allow
the
commerce
act,
if
you
allow
damage
actions
for
violation
of
the
commerce
act
to
be
filed
in
state
court,
you
are
essentially
allowing
each
state
to
create
a
separate
regulatory
system
consisting
of
damage
actions
and
the
u.s.
supreme
court
faced
a
similar
situation
in
san
diego
unions
v.
garmon,
where
the
u.s.
supreme
court
recognized
that
if
it
permitted
state
damage
actions
to
be
filed
by
an
employer
for
economic
loss
sustained
because
of
peaceful
picketing,
not
violent
picketing,
then
in
effect
it
would
be
allowing
a
state
court
system
to
create
a
system
of
regulation
by
damage
actions
which
would
create
a
separate
body
of
law
competing
with
the
body
of
law
that
is
created
under
the
federal
judicial
system
interpreting
and
applying
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
the
esch
car
service
act,
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
more
importantly,
i
think,
the
transportation
act
of
1920
evidence
a
new
and
radically
different
philosophy
of
congress
with
regard
to
regulation
of
interstate
commerce.
the
transportation
act
of
1920
was
designed
to
give
plenary
control,
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
system
to
govern
the
provision
of
interstate
transportation
service,
the
abandonment
of
lines,
the
extension
of
lines,
and
the
reason
for
that,
the
court
in
transit
commission
v.
u.
s.
stated,
is
because
it
had
been
found
that
concurrent
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
areas
of
interstate
commerce
addressed
in
the
1920
act
had
been
found
to
be
detrimental
to
interstate
commerce.
the
competing
local
interest
in
this
case,
the
respondent's
local
interest,
is
economic
loss,
and
if
you
analyze
his
state
law
claims,
although
the
claims
of
the
respondent
are
couched
in
terms
of
state
law,
they
are
claiming
damage
to
their
business
because
of
cessation
of
interstate
transportation
service.
and
each
state
law
claim
requires
proof
of
two
things:
first,
the
existence
of
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
provide
interstate
transportation
service;
and
secondly,
to
prove
that
such
a
duty
was
breached
by
the
railroad.
it
is
undisputed...
and
this
is
the
crucial
and
central
fact
of
this
case...
it
is
undisputed
that
every
rail
shipment
to
and
from
kalo's
factory
was
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
if
there
is
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
after
april
4,
1973,
when
the
line
became
physically
impassable,
there
is
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
after
that
date
to
provide
interstate
transportation
service,
then
kalo's
state
law
claims
fall,
because
they
all
presuppose
the
existence
of
that
duty.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
there
is
a
physical
injury
or
something
of
that
nature
where
there
may
have
existed
a
stronger
local
interest.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
that
issue
has
been
addressed
by
some
state
courts
and
that
percentage;
basically,
in
state
courts,
most
of
the
state
courts
have
said,
that's
not
enough
intrastate
commerce
to
set
aside
the
overriding
national
interest.
but
i
think
the
way
to
determine
that
question
is
to
look
at
section
1-17(a)
of
the
commerce
act,
which
says
the
states'
regulation
of
intrastate
commerce
is
invalid
if
it
conflicts
with
a
lawful
order
of
the
commission.
and
i
think
that
the
cases
indicate
that
under
the
commerce
act,
the
commerce
act
will
govern
even
intrastate
commerce
if
the
effect
of
intrastate
commerce
on
interstate
commerce
is
so
great
that
it
creates
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
in
this
case
we
have
no
intrastate
rail
shipments,
it's
strictly
interstate.
there's
never
been
any
factual
dispute
about
that
in
this
lawsuit.
and
the
respondent
has
characterized
this
as
a
negligence
case,
a
car
service
case,
common
law
tortious
interference.
but
none
of
those
state
law
theories
hold
any
weight
unless
the
respondent
proves
a
duty
to
provide
interstate
rail
service
to
its
plant
site.
and
that
is
an
inquiry
which
should
be
addressed
under
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
the
state
of
iowa
cannot
require
provision
of
interstate
car
service
under
state
law.
the
esch
car
service
act
was
enacted
to
preempt
state
law,
and
missouri
pacific
railroad
v.
stroud
in
1926
stated
that
state
law
has
no
application
to
provision
of
car
service
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
federal
courthouse
in
fort
dodge
is
four
blocks
from
the
state
courthouse
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
car
service
provisions
or
transportation
service
provisions,
that
may
be
attacked
in
the
commerce
commission
or
in
federal
district
court.
and
it's
attacked
under
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
been
construed
to
make
the
forum
provisions
of
section
9
exclusive
with
regard
to
a
damage
action
commenced
pursuant
to
section
8
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
reason
for...
in
addition
to
the
reason
for
having
interstate
service
questions
determined
under
one
act,
the
interstate
commerce
act,
there
is
another
reason,
and
that
is
that
the
philosophy
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
been
to
place
the
interests
in
forming
a
national
transportation
system,
an
economically
efficient
national
transportation
system,
over
and
above
the
competing
local
interests.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
do
not.
the
abandonment
proceeding...
the
ruling
of
the
commerce
commission
buttresses
our
argument
in
two
respects.
first,
before
theme
was
any
trial
court
ruling...
which,
by
the
way,
the
trial
court
ruled
in
our
favor
and
the
court
of
appeals
saw
fit
to
reverse.
before
there
was
any
trial
court
judgment,
the
commerce
ruled,
the
commerce
commission
ruled
that
our
cessation
of
service
was
not
due
to
any
condition
that
we
could
have
controlled.
now,
that
puts
the
court
of
appeals
of
iowa's
ruling
directly
in
conflict
with
section
1-17(a)
which
says
that
even
regulation
of
intrastate
service
is
invalid
if
it
conflicts
with
the
lawful
order
of
the
commission.
here
we
have
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
a
webster
county
district
court
can
regulate
by
damage
action
interstate
transportation
service
in
direct
contradiction
to
an
order
of
the
icc.
the
respondent
admitted
in
its
brief
that
central
and
necessary
to
its
state
law
claim
is
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
cessation
of
service
was
due
to
conditions
within
the
control
of
the
railroad.
and
the
icc
has
found
just
the
opposite.
so
having
followed
the
interstate
commerce
act,
followed
the
provisions,
gone
to
the
icc,
participated
in
a
proceeding
in
which
kalo
was
a
party,
and
having
our
conduct
approved
by
the
icc,
we
now
find
ourselves
in
the
situation
of
being
subjected
to
exposure
of
a
state
law
damage
action
which
can
be
successful
by
the
respondent's
admission
in
its
brief
only
if
a
trial
court
reaches
a
finding
opposite
to
the
finding
that
icc
has
already
made
in
a
lawful
proceeding.
so
i
think
that
the
icc's
order
should
be
issue
preclusive,
even
if
there
were
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court.
but
more
importantly,
i
think
that
there
should
be
no
jurisdiction
permitted
to
a
state
court
when
you're
talking
about
simply
provision
of
interstate
transportation
service.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
under
section
9
the
plaintiff
may
seek
damages
in
either
of
those
forums
for
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
i
feel
that
in
the
situation
we
have
in
this
case,
where
you
have
physical
impassability
of
the
line,
i
think
a
district
court,
where
you're
talking
about
awarding
damages--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--yes.
i
think
they
would
refer
this
to--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--i
believe
they
would.
in
an
abandonment
proceeding
some
of
the--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--yes.
because
it
would
require...
if
you're
going
to
make
a
final
and
conclusive
award
of
damages,
i
think
that
you
should
refer
to
the
icc,
but--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--well,
that's
an
appealable
decision.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes,
i
think
it's--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--well,
i
think
if
the
district
court
decided
in
the
facts
of
the
case
that
it
required
the
discretion
or
expertise
of
the
commission
referred
it,
then
the
district
court
would
follow
the
commission's
ruling.
if
it
decided
it
did
not
require
the
expertise
of
the
commission,
and
it
could
decide
the
issue
itself,
then
it
would
not
refer
to
the
commission.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
no,
i
believe
that
the
district
court--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--yes.
that
would
be
my
opinion,
because
i
believe
the
district
court
is
saving
that
this
is
not
a
decision
i
think
i
should
make,
i
think
it's
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
and
then
i
think
appeal
of
that
order
would
be
under
the
statutory
procedures
for
appealing
the
commerce
decision.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes,
as
i
understand
it.
and--
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
--then
they
would
not
award
damages.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
preclusive.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
in
the
state
court,
you
mean?
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
if
there's
primary
jurisdiction.
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
what
lime
i
have
left,
if
any,
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
we
have
divided
argument
with
the
commerce
commission.
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
a
very
short
one.
mr.
bruce
e.
johnson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
puritan
case
cited
by
the
respondent,
wherein
the
court
in
puritan
says
that
the
congress
evidenced
its
intent
to
make
the
commerce
commission
and
the
federal
district
court
the
exclusive
forums
for
section
9
damage
action.
and
their
reason
for
that
is
that
after
section
9
was
enacted
by
congress,
it
enacted
the
carmack
amendment
on
freight
loss
and
damage
claims,
which
specifically
gave
actions
in
state
or
federal
court.
secondly,
that
the
johnson
case,
the
9th
circuit
case
cited
by
respondent
in
his
argument
as
his
foremost
case,
specifically
states
that
it
is
deciding
the
case
under
federal
law
and
declined
to
apply
state
law.
and
that
case
was
tried
in
a
federal
district
court.
i
have
nothing
further,
unless
there
are
some
questions.
