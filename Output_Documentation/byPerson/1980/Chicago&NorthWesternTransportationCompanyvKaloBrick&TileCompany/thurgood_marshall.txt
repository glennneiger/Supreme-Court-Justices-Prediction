justice
marshall
mr.
blackburn,
before
you
get
to
facts,
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
colorado
case?
you
talked
about
the
other
one.
justice
marshall
thank
you.
justice
marshall
well,
wouldn't
that
remedy
destroy
the
colorado
case?
justice
marshall
mr.
blackburn,
under
your
theory
would
it
be
possible
to
have
exactly
50
different
theories
of
negligence
for
abandonment
of
interstate
railroads?
justice
marshall
is
that
possible?
justice
marshall
could
there
be
51--
justice
marshall
--different
maintenance
of
track
theories
of
negligence
in
the
country?
justice
marshall
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
wants?
justice
marshall
i
think
you'd
better.
justice
marshall
but
could
it?
justice
marshall
i
say
it
possibly
could,
so
you
agree
it
possibly
could.
justice
marshall
and
it
possibly
could
have
50
different
theories
about
running
railroads.
justice
marshall
and
that
gives
you
no
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
state
of
iowa.
that
court
held
that
respondent,
a
shipper,
could
to
pursue
a
state
damage
action
against
petitioner,
a
regulated
rail
carrier,
for
failure
to
provide
adequate
service.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
state
damage
action
is
preempted
by
the
provisions
of
interstate
commerce
act
even
the
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
or
decisions
by
regulated
carriers
to
suspend
service.
for
reasons
set
forth
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
when,
as
here,
the
commission
has
already
upheld
the
carrier
decision
to
abandon
the
line
in
question.
no
state
actions
or
damages
can
lie
against
the
carrier.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
liable
as
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
