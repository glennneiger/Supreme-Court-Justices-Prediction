justice
white
no,
what?
no,
you
can't
file
it,
or
no,
you
can?
justice
white
but,
if
he
sues
in
the
federal
district
court,
don't
the
controlling
cases
suggest
or
hold
that
the
district
court
should
refer
the
guts
of
the
case
to
the
icc?
justice
white
well,
whether
the
suspension
of
service
was
justified
or
not?
justice
white
or
would
they
have
to?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
white
because
of
primary
jurisdiction?
justice
white
suppose
the
reference
was
made
and
the
icc
ruled
that
cessation
was
proper
and
no
damages,
can
the
district
court
them
come
to
the
contrary
conclusion?
justice
white
well,
so
in
that
very
case?
in
that
very
case
or...
now,
i
thought
appeal
was
to
a
court
of
appeal?
justice
white
right?
justice
white
so
the
district
court
can't
come
to
a
contrary
conclusion?
justice
white
don't
you
have
to
appeal
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
now?
justice
white
well,
suppose
you
start
off
with
damages
before
the
commission,
don't
go
to
the
district
court,
what
kind
of
a
proceeding
is
that?
that
is
a
damages
action,
i
take
it?
justice
white
well,
then
what
if
the
icc
says
the
cessation
was
justified?
justice
white
well,
and
then...
let's
assume
you
then
go
to
the
district
court,
would
the
railroad...
i
suppose
you
would
suggest
the
railroad
would
plead
res
judicata?
justice
white
there's
no
difference
between
that
case,
and
than
when
you
start
off
in
the
district
court,
is
there?
justice
white
no,
in
the
district.
justice
white
why
wouldn't
that
be
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
that's
because
of
the
referral
statute?
justice
white
but
review
is
on
the
record,
isn't
it,
or
is
it?
justice
white
but
the
district
court
couldn't
rehear
the
whole
matter,
could
it?
it
would
have
to
review
it
on
the
record?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
and
if
the
findings
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
accept
them.
justice
white
do
you
mean,
not
only
state
law
is
ousted
but
the
state
courts
are
ousted?
right.
just
as
in
ratemaking
proceedings.
justice
white
oh,
it
is
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
try
collective
bargaining
cases
in
the
state
courts,
although
it's
federal
law
that's
administered.
justice
white
do
you
think,
here...
have
there
been
some
holdings
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
exclusive?
justice
white
does
the
present
act
say
so?
does
it
say
it's
exclusively
a
federal
court
matter?
justice
white
i
see;
yes.
