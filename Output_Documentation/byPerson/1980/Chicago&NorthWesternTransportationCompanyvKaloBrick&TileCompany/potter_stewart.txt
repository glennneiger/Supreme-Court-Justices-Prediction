justice
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
rush,
your
position
is
that
there
is
no
room
here
for
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
or
for
a
reference
to
the
commission
by
a
state
court,
but
that
the
enactment
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
its
companion
legislation
means
that
state
courts
are
completely
ousted
from
jurisdiction
in
this
field.
is
that
correct?
