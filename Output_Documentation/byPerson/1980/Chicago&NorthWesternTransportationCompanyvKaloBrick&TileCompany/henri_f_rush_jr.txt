mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
decisions
interpreting
the
esch
car
service
act,
a
statute
which
my
colleague
referred
to,
and
also
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
which
brought
for
the
first
time
extension
and
abandonment
of
rail
lines
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government,
under
federal
regulation.
this
court
has
held
that
the
provisions
of
these
acts
vests
exclusive
responsibility
for
the
regulation
of
car
service
and
cessation
of
service
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
principally
among
those
and
on
which
we
largely
rest
our
case
in
this
proceeding
are
this
court's
decisions
in
colorado
v.
united
states,
in
the
purcell
case,
in
the
transit
commission
case,
and
in
the
case
of
mo.
pac.
v.
stroud.
the
government
has
urged
this
court
to
grant
certiorari
and
appears
today
to
present
a
single
point,
but
one
that
is
of
extreme
importance
to
the
commission
in
performing
its
responsibilities
under
the
provisions
i
have
just
referred
to.
that
point
is
that
the
recognition
of
a
state
or
common
law
cause
of
action
for
damages
in
state
court
in
matters
relating
to
an
interstate
railroad
cessation
of
service
would
undermine
the
accomplishment
of
federal
objectives
embodied
in
the
abandonment
and
car
service
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
i
would
hang
my
hat
on
it,
justice
rehnquist.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
exactly
the
point
here,
that
a
state
damage
action
is
asserted
on
a
matter
involving
either
car
service
or
abandonment,
both
of
which
have
been
found
to
be
within
the
exclusive
province
of
the
federal
government
and
the
commission
to
regulate.
so
that,
i
mean,
i
would
simply
underline
that
sentence
that
you
read,
that
it
does
have
no
applicability.
and
that
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
government
case,
damages
are
as
effective
a
way
of
regulating
as
injunctive
or
regulatory
relief.
indeed,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
right
asserted
here
to
obtain
damages
after
the
fact
is
vastly
more
pernicious
and
disruptive
of
the
federal
scheme
than
the
seeking
of
injunctive
relief.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
that
thought
hadn't
occurred
to
me.
they
ignored
our
decision
so
i
think
they
were
not
purporting
to
perform
nonfederal
hobbs
act
required
review.
but
it
certainly--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
would.
and,
of
course,
a
state
court
could
in
theory
refer
a
question
to
the
commission
and
get
an
answer
back
from
the
commission.
and
so
i
would
suppose
it
might
be
closer
to
that,
although
they
did
not
refer
the
question,
nor
did
they
in
any
fashion
defer.
and
as
my
colleague,
mr.
johnson
points
out,
they
can't
defer,
for
the
plaintiff
to
succeed.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
a
state
court?
i
should
think
so.
a
federal
court,
i
would
think
that
our
decision
on
referral
under
the
referral
act
would
be
as
binding
on
that
court
as
the
reasoning
which
went
into
it.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
no,
but
it
would
be
subject
to
normal
principles
of
judicial
review
so
that
provided
the
reasoning
was
sound
and
we
stayed
within
out
statutory
authority,
they
would
be
obligated
to
follow
it,
in
my
view.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
because
if
it
were
referred,
initial
review
is
by
law
in
the
district
court
that
referred
it.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
justice
white.
they
perform
a
mixed
review
and
acceptance
of
the
referral,
but
then
appeal
from
that,
of
course,
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be
on
the
record,
just
as
any
other
agency
proceeding.
once--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--no,
sir.
no--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--it
would
be
my
view
they
cannot
review
it
ab
initio,
that
they
would
have
to
accept
the
record
made
before
the
commission.
and
in
that
respect
it--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--that's
correct.
so
there
would
be
a
heavy
presumption
favoring
the
valid
interpretation
of
the
commission.
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
it
had
to
be
accepted
regardless,
was
my
only
point.
but
to
turn
to
this
question
of
damages
and
the
problem
that
we
perceive
in
connection
with
that,
the
respondents
don't
suggest,
nor
could
they
in
the
face
of
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
which
i
have
named,
that
the
state
court
could
require
the
restoration
of
service.
but
injunctive
relief,
actually,
is
preferable
from
the
standpoint
that
you
have
the
equitable
considerations
being
laid
in
that
context.
and
the
cases
cited
in
the
respondent's
own
brief
demonstrate
that
when
action
is
brought
in
federal
court,
as
all
of
their
cases
parenthetically
i
would
note,
were...
they
have
been
properly
brought
before
a
federal
court...
the
question
becomes
one
of
whether
it
is
equitable
to
require
restoration
of
service
pending
&
decision
by
the
commission.
that
injunction,
of
course,
dies
when
a
decision
has
been
handed
down
by
the
commission,
if
in
fact
a
mandatory
injunction
is
entered.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
respondents
in
the
court,
of
appeals
relied
through
their
proposition
supporting
an
award
of
damages
ultimately
entirely
on
three
decisions
of
this
court,
decided
in
1915
and
1916,
interpreting
section
22
of
the
act.
we
believe
those
cases
are
all
distinguishable
on
the
ground
that
no
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
railroad's
challenged
practice
was
before
the
courts,
and
hence
if
one
were
to
take
a
primary
jurisdiction
approach
to
the
issue
of
preemption,
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
defer
to
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction.
however,
more
fundamentally,
we
submit
that
those
decisions
ought
to
be
found
not
to
have
survived
the
enactment
cf
the
esch
car
service
act
and
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
as
i
have
indicated,
this
court
has
held
that
those
enactments
vested
sole
jurisdiction
or
responsibility,
i
should
say,
in
the
commission
for
regulation
of
the
matters
of
car
service
and
cessation
of
rail
service.
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
section
22
is
not
to
be
read
literally
to
absolutely
preserve
common
law
rights.
it's
early
decision
in
texas
&
pacific
railway
v.
abilene
cotton
oil
company
found
that
to
hold
that
a
state
right
of
damages
survived
because
of
section
22
would
be
destructive
to
the
pervasive
scheme
of
rate
regulation
embodied
within
the
act.
and
hence
it
ought
to
be
found
hot
to
survive.
we
believe
that
the
esch
car
service
act
and
the
transportation
act
cf
1920
similarly
encompass
a
pervasive
scheme
of
regulation,
where
interstate
commerce
and
interstate
railroads
are
involved,
of
all
matters
relating
to
the
cessation
of
rail
service
by
such
an
interstate
carrier.
we
ask
this
court
to
find,
as
it
did
in...
or
to
hold
as
it
did
in
the
rate
area,
that
no
such
remedy
survives
in
connection
with
these
matters
under
any
circumstances.
anything
less
than
that,
a
resort
to
the
question
of,
are
there
issues
of
primary
jurisdiction
or
not,
will
simply
breed
more
litigation,
i
suggest,
in
this
area,
and
it
is
not
a
satisfactory
test.
in
the
rate
area
the
court
has
absolutely
and
clearly
foreclosed
state
and
common
law
remedies.
we
ask
it
to
do
so
in
connection
with
the
cessation
of
interstate
rail
service.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
literally,
as
i've
always
considered
the
doctrine,
it
means
that
the
court
must
defer
initially
to
a
decision
by
the
commission.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
it's
subject
to...
as
i
indicated
to
you
earlier,
justice
rehnquist,
a
review
on
the
traditional
grounds
of
judicial
review
of
commission
decisions.
so
it
has
some
limited
role,
but--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--no,
sir,
i'm
suggesting
it
is
comparable
to
apa
review,
but
that
is
a
very
limiting
type
of
review.
it
does
not
make
take
court
a
co-equal
partner,
it
is
not
at
liberty
to
say,
well,
here
are
some
facts
and
here
are
some
facts.
you
looked
at
the
facts
and
came
out
this
way,
we
looked
at
the
facts
and
come
out
this
way.
if
what
the
commission
has
done
based
on
these
facts
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
which
as
you
well
know
is
an
elusive
test,
but
if
it's
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
it
must
be
sustained.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
that
argument,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
our
position.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
well,
i
would
modify
that
only
in
one
respect,
justice
rehnquist.
that
is,
we
have
a
procedure
known
as
modified
procedure
which
was
in
fact
followed
in
this
case,
which
would
have
meant
all
they
would
have
had
to
do
to
try
their
case
would
have
been
to
go
to
their
mailbox
and
mail
their
pleadings
and
evidence
to
the
commission.
then,
but
only
if
a
material
issue
of
fact
were
in
dispute,
would
the
matter
be
required
to
be
set
for
cross-examination.
and
that
indeed,
probably,
under
commission
practice,
would
have
taken
place
out
in
iowa.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
i
would
think
that's
correct.
it
is
conceivable
a
state
court
could
try
an
action
based
on
a
federal
statute
and
issue
we
don't
have
in
this
case,
of
course.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
yes,
sir,
although
our--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
under
section
9
of
our
act.
wrongs
are
complained
of--
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
--no,
but
the
way
those
cases
go,
since
it
says
you
may
bring
it
in
federal
court,
that
that
means
you
must,
if
you're
complaining
under
it.
mr.
henri
f.
rush,
jr.
thank
you.
