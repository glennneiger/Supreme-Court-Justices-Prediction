justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
nature
of
the
icc
proceeding,
mr.
johnson?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
shipper
had
sought
to
sue
the
railroad
under
the
hepburn
act,
under
the
carmack
amendment
to
the
icc,
is
federal
court
jurisdiction
there
exclusive?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
it
were...
you
say
then
that
it
couldn't
be
filed
in
the
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
body
of
law
has
to
be
common
and
uniform;
but
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
concurrent
jurisdiction
exists
between
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
courts
in
applying
that
uniform
body
of
law.
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
that
the
state
of
iowa
can't
tell
a
railroad
it
must
provide
the
cap
service
to
a
particular
plant,
even
though
it
doesn't
conflict
directly
with
the
icc
provisions?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
say
the
plaintiff
could
attack
the
action
of
the
railroad
either
before
the
icc
or
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
it
decided
that
it
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
commission's
views,
the
commission
said
the
abandonment
was
justified,
could
the
district
court
overturn
that
finding
of
the
commission?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
rush,
what
do
you
do
with
that
last
paragraph
in
stroud
that
says
the
state
law
has
no
application
to
the
furnishing
of
cars
to
shippers
for
the
transportation
of
freight
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
the
state
court
be
bound
by
the
action
that
it
got
back
from
the
icc?
justice
rehnquist
then,
you
don't
really
have
a
uniform
system
if,
as
your
colleague
contends,
where
you
have
it
in
the
federal
court
alone,
since
the
federal
court
according
to
you
is
not
bound
to
follow
the
icc.
justice
rehnquist
and
then
the
commission's
decision
is
reviewable
only
in
the
normal
appellate
process?
justice
rehnquist
is
primary
jurisdiction
simply
a
question
of
deferral
and
then
the
court
ultimately
deciding,
or
is
it
a
question
that
the
court
simply
keeps
its
hands
off
and
it's
a
decision
for
the
commission
to
finally
make?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
"initially",
what
do
you
mean?
justice
rehnquist
it's
not
like
a
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
where
any
agency
action
can
be
reviewed
for
it's
arbitrary
or
contrary
to
law.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
for
your
counsel
or
your
associate
counsel
for
the
railroad
to
state
that
the
courthouse
at
fort
dodge
is
only
four
miles
or
four
blocks
away,
is
really
rather
elusive
so
far
as
the
plaintiff
is
concerned
because
it
means
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
come
back
to
washington.
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
you
can't
get
a
final
trial
of
your
case
in
the
federal
court
if
you're
right.
justice
rehnquist
everybody
all
over
the
country
has
to
come
back
to
washington
and
try
their
case
before
the
icc.
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
if
you
were
dealing
with
an
interurban
service
between
two
cities
in
iowa
or
a
public
utility,
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
require
the
utility
to
extend
its
services
to
any
willing
customer
under
existing
law,
would
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
in
the
absence
of
congressional
preemption.
justice
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
we
have
the
decision
of
the
final
court
in
iowa
that
passed
on
the
question
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
a
damage
action
was
permissible
under
state
law.
so
that
unless
there's
a
federal
question
that
the
iowa
court
decided
wrongly,
iowa
allows
recovery
here.
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
stroud
case,
that
last
language
there
where
it
says
that
obviously
the
state
law
has
no
application
to
the
furnishing
of
cars
to
shippers
for
the
transportation
of
freight
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
rehnquist
are
those
set
forth
anywhere
in
the
briefs?
justice
rehnquist
in
the
appendix?
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
then,
that's
a
products
liability
theory?
justice
rehnquist
but
those
have
been
generated
largely
by
state
court
fashioning
of
tort
law
remedies.
here
we
have
congressional
statutes
that
govern
us
and
we
aren't
free
to
depart
from
them.
