justice
white
well
do
you
think
you
are
fatally
wounded
if
we
accept
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
announced
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
this
case?
justice
mosk
didn't
seem
to
think
so.
justice
white
well,
what
if
it
is
overinclusive?
justice
white
well,
assume
there
is
an
equal
culpability,
but
unequal
impact
on
the
parties
engaging
in
this
conduct;
which
is
what,
i
take
it,
the
california
court
relied
upon,
and
that
apparently
drawing
the
conclusion
that
it
is
permissible
to
punish
the
male
even
though
the
female
may
be
equally
culpable,
because
the
female
is
hurt
more?
justice
white
and
that
the
male
deserves
to
be
punished
for
engaging
in
conduct
that
will
hurt
the
other
person
more
than
it
does
himself.
justice
white
isn't
that...
isn't
that
generally
the--
justice
white
--well
how
do
you
answer
that?
justice
white
you're
just
saying
she...
the
female
is
equally
culpable,
that's
all
you're
saying.
justice
white
well
the
state
is
saying
to
the
male,
because
the
results
of
this
conduct
will
fall
more
heavily
on
the
female,
you
should
be
especially
careful.
justice
white
and
some
liability
for
support,
eventually?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you...
could
i
ask
you,
suppose
a
young
man,
a
teenager,
is
on
trial
under
this
statute
and
he's
tried
before
the
judge,
and
he
defends
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
as
applied
to
him
is
unconstitutional
because
in
this
case
the
woman
was
the
aggressor,
and
that
he
surely
shouldn't
be
punished
in
those
circumstances
and
the
judge
finds
yes,
the
woman
was
the
aggressor,
and
is
much
culpable
and
blameworthy
in
the
case,
but
nevertheless
says
this
statute
requires
it
and
this
statute
is
constitutional.
i
suppose
you
must
defend
the
statute,
even
in
those
circumstances?
justice
white
well
but
that's
just
avoidance,
you
would
say,
even
if
it
were
applied
every
day
in
those
kinds
of
circumstances
that
i
gave
you,
it
would
be
constitutional?
