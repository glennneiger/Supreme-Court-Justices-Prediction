chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning,
in
number
79-1344;
michael
m.
against
the
superior
court
of
sonoma
county,
california.
now,
mr.
jilka,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
can
the
state...
can
a
state
constitutionally
make
it
a
criminal
act
for
a
woman
of,
let
us
say,
30,
to
seduce
a
young
boy
of
14
or
15?
chief
justice
burger
most
states
do,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
burger
you
may
have
answered
this
before,
but
if
he
had
been
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
instead
of
a
felony,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
burger
would
your
case
still
survive
if
california
had
a
statute
that,
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor
boy
was
a
felony?
chief
justice
burger
when?
what
doubt
do
you
have
about
it?
chief
justice
burger
if
the
range
of
sentences
were
the
same
for
both
the
present
statute
and
the
one
i
hypothesized
would
there
by
any
difference?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
doesn't
attend
to
the
statutes
in
california?
chief
justice
burger
most
states
have
no
legislative
history
of
the
kind
that
we
find
in
the
congress,
generally,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
so
does
that
have
some
connection
with
the
general
proposition
that
if
there
is
any
rational
basis
which
the
court
can
see
for
the
legislation,
then
there
is
an
obligation
to
sustain
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kriegler.
chief
justice
burger
but
if
the
facts
have
any
relevancy
at
all,
they
bear
only
on
the
decision
of
the
prosecutor
as
to
whether
to
prosecute
on
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor,
isn't
that
so?
and
that
issue
is
not
before
us.
only
the
constitutionality,
as
justice
stewart
has
said
several
times,
on
its
face,
is
the
issue
here.
chief
justice
burger
well
why
then,
all
these
statistics
on
the
great
rise
in
pregnancies
of
unmarried
teenagers,
12-13-14
years
old,
if
that
wasn't
related
to
the
legislatures'
purpose?
chief
justice
burger
according
to
the
opinion
of
others
i
thought
that
california's
position
was
that
the
california
legislature
has
a
right
to
try
to
protect
minor
children,
females,
from
the
whole
range
of
consequences
of
this
kind
of
conduct?
chief
justice
burger
but
you
haven't
been
making
that
argument,
mr.
kriegler.
yes,
you've
hardly
had
time,
have
you?
no.
or
a
chance.
chief
justice
burger
well,
now,
go
ahead
and
make
it
now,
if
you
are
ready
to.
chief
justice
burger
well
i
come
back
again
to
where
we've
been
before.
we're
not
dealing
with
this
case
of
the
statute
as
applied,
but
on
its
face,
and
nothing
else.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
number
79-1344,
michael
m.
against
the
superior
court
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
