mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
gregory
jilka.
i
am
one
of
the
attorneys
for
michael
m.,
a
17-year
old
california
youth
who
comes
before
this
court
seeking
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
a
judgment
which
upheld
the
validity,
the
constitutional
validity
of
california
penal
code
section
261.5,
on
equal
protection
grounds.
in
oral
argument
this
morning,
i
propose
first
to
outline
the
issue
in
its
procedural
posture;
secondly,
to
discuss
the
purposes
and
to
assert
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
thirdly,
to
discuss
the
so-called
pregnancy
prevention
rationale
and
as
to
whether
or
not
it
really
diminishes
the
criminal
culpability
of
the
female.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
california
to
prosecute
my
client,
michael,
for
violation
of
the
statute.
the
statute
provides,
and
i
quote,
it
prohibits
"an
act
of
sexual
intercourse
accomplished
with
a
female
not
the
wife
of
the
perpetrator,
where
the
female
is
under
the
age
of
18
years.
"
the
operative
facts
in
this
case
are
simply
that
michael
stands
accused
of
the
crime.
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
the
crime
and
comes
before
this
court
clothed
with
the
presumption
of
innocence.
he
is
currently
awaiting
trial,
pending
the
decision
of
the
court
in
this
case.
both
california
and
the
united
states,
as
amicus
on
behalf
of
california,
have
suggested
to
this
court
that
michael
is
guilty
of
a
crime
of
which
he
is
not
charged;
that
crime
is
forcible
rape.
the
suggestion
that
force
existed
in
this
case
is
unsupported
by
any
judicial
finding
and
is
immaterial
to
the
issues
presented.
and,
in
my
opinion,
tends
to
obfuscate
the
issue.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
no,
justice
rehnquist,
it
could
not.
the
information
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
is
the
charging
document
and
it
clearly
states
that
michael
is
charged
with
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
elements
are
simply
that
he
participated
in
an
act
of
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
who
was
under
the
age
of
18.
forcible
rape
would
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
do
believe,
however,
that
we
have
fairly
presented
a
limited
constitutional
question
on
the
applicability
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
a
17
and
a
half
year
old
female
who
is
charged
with
sexual
intercourse
with
a
16
and
a
half
year
old.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
feel
that
those
facts
are
fairly
before
the
court
because--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--yes,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
he
is,
he
certainly
is.
those
facts
were
alleged
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandate,
and
were
admitted
by
the
state
of
california.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
facial
issue
of
constitutionality
goes.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
charged
with
a
felony.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
your
honor,
this
statute
could
have
been
charged
as
a
misdemeanor
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
attorney,
the
prosecuting
authority.
if
convicted,
michael--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--certainly.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
your
honor,
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
true.
i
would,
however,
point
out
that
what
happened
at
the
trial
court
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
demurrer,
but
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
at
which
evidence
was
presented
and
primarily
the
evidence
which
was
presented
was
the
age
of
michael.
so--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--that's
correct,
it
is
not
part
of
the
complaint,
but
it
is
certainly
a
matter
of
record.
if
convicted,
michael's
conviction
would
be
predicated
on
the
existence
of
essentially
four
facts.
first
of
all,
that
michael
is
a
male;
secondly,
that
he
simply
participated
in
an
act
of
sexual
intercourse,
that
sharon,
his
partner,
was
under
the
age
of
18
years,
and
fourth,
that
michael
and
sharon
were
not
married.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
essentially
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
the
california
supreme
court,
in
exercise
of
its
original
and
discretionary
jurisdiction,
issued
an
alternative
writ
to
call
that
issue
before
it
and
decided
that
very
issue
of
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
so
when
the
case
comes
here,
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
it's
really
without
a
record
below
or
a
very,
very
limited
record.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
an
accurate
synopsis
of
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion.
the
statute,
california
penal
code
section
261.5,
embodies
and
reflects
the
traditional
sexual
stereotypes.
because
only
the
male
can
violate
the
statute,
it
is
presumed
that
he
is
the
passionate
aggressor,
and
similarly,
conversely,
that
the
female
is
the
helpless
victim
who
needs
the
paternalistic
protection
of
the
state
and
the
protection
of
the
statute.
neither
california
nor
the
united
states
have
even
attempted
to
refute
that
the
statute
is
cast
in
terms
of
the
traditional
and
outmoded
sex
roles.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
your
honor,
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that
is
absolutely
true,
of
course.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
as
far
as
the
age
criteria
goes,
that's
not
challenged.
what
we're
challenging
is
the
discrimination
between
males
and
females.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's...
that
certainly
could
be
made,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
much
different
case
because
the
discrimination--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--it
could
be,
it
certainly
could
be.
in
that
case,
there
would
not
be
discrimination,
of
course,
on
the
basis
of
sex.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
has
been
done
in
varying
forms
by
at
least
37
of
the
states.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
certainly
not.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
no.
your
honor.
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
classifications
on
the
basis
of
sex,
which
perpetuate
we
feel,
the
traditional
stereotypes.
because--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--similarly
situated
males,
yes--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well
that
certainly
could
be
one
of
the
logical
conclusions
of
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
that's
challenged.
i
think
that,
when
force
is
involved,
there
certainly
is
a
much
different
situation
before
the
court.
but
that's...
that
argument
has
certainly
been
made,
and
i
believe,
in
a
recent
tulane
law
school
law
review
article
that
that
very
hypothesis
is
set
forward.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
right.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court's
invalidation
of
the
statute
would
necessarily
force
the
conclusion
that
all
forcible
rape
laws
are
gender
neutral,
or
must
be
gender
neutral.
in
fact,
in
california,
the
forcible
rape
law
is
gender
neutral,
ironically
enough,
and
so
are
all
of
the
other
statutes
that
are
designed
to
prevent
the
sexual
exploitation
of
california
citizens.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
that's
correct.
as
a
racial
minority--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--yes,
that's
right,
that's
right,
they
could,
certainly,
but
not
as
a
principal.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
would
certainly
say
that
that's
within
the
realm
of
the
state's
legitimate
concern--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--yes,
in
one
form
or
another;
for
example,
in
california,
it
is
a
very
minor
offense,
it's
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor,
it's
a
misdemeanor.
whereas
michael,
because...
simply
because
of
his
sex,
now
is
facing
a
felony
charge.
if
the
sex
roles
were
reversed
around,
if
it
were
an
older
male
or
a
male
of
any
age
and
a
female,
there's
heightened
criminal
penalties.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
don't
know.
the
procedure
that
was
utilized
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
exercising
its
original
jurisdiction
is
predicated
in
the
statute
and
i
just
don't
know
if
the
california
supreme
court
would
have
taken
this
case
had
it
been
in
a
lower
level
court;
that's
problematic.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
think
that
would
follow,
your
honor;
certainly.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
as
an
aider
and
abettor,
that's
true.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
guess
i
could
not,
in
honesty,
answer
that
question.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
well,
the
penalties
that
are
prescribed
are
the
same
for
aiders
and
abettors
as
for
the
principals,
certainly,
if
that's
your
question,
yes.
i
would
point
out
to
the
case,
a
new
eighth
circuit
opinion
in
a
case
called
navedo
v.
preisser,
which
was
decided
on
september
22nd
of
this
year,
in
which
the
eighth
circuit
invalidated
the
iowa
statutory
rape
law.
that
was
a
different
statutory
rape
law
than
california,
certainly,
but
i
think
that
some
of
the
reasoning
certainly
applies
here.
in
considering
the
pregnancy--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--no,
your
honor,
it's
a
recent
case;
it
was
after
the
brief,
it
was
decided
september
22nd,
1980,
in
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
navedo,
n-a-v-e-d-o
v.
preisser,
and
i
could
provide
the
court
with
the
case
number.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
it's
p-r-e-i-s-s-e-r,
is
the
second
name.
the
first
is
navedo,
n-a-v-e-d-o.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
september
22nd.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--well
because,--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--well
a
male
and
a
female
can
be
punished
equally
only
if
the
female
aids
and
abets
the
male
in
performing
an
act
of
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
under
the
age
of
18.
there
is
no...
what
we're
focusing
on
here
should
be
the
conduct.
if
a
male
engages
in
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
under
18,
that's
a
felony;
but
if
a
female
does
not
do
the
very
same...
if
the
female
does
the
very
same
act,
that
is,
engages
in
sexual
intercourse
with
a--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
however,
i
would
represent
to
the
court
that
in
practice,
that
the
victim,
the
purported
victim
is
never
charged
with
a
crime.
i
couldn't--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--oh,
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
there
are...
we
estimate
that
there
are
probably
more--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
don't
know
that
to
be
true,
your
honor,
but
that
certainly
could
be.
i
suppose
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
the
engaging
in
sexual
conduct...
sexual
intercourse
for
a
male
and
a
female
is
basically
the
same
act,
a
mutual
act;
for
a
male
under
the
same
circumstances
it's
a
felony,
but
for
the
female
to
participate,
it
is
not.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
a
female
can
and
would
be
charged
as
an
aider
and
abettor,
a
female
so-called
victim.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
been
applied
your
honor,
and
i...
in
california,
your
honor...
and
i
don't
have
the
case
authority
for
that,
i
certainly
wish
i
did.
but
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
that
the
female
is
in
practice
and
in
law
not
considered
to
be
culpable
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
that
is
the
female
victim,
excuse
me.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
it
may,
it
may.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well
the
doubt
that
i
would
have
would
be
if
the
substantive
elements
of
the
crime
were
identical
and
the
purposes
were
identical,
then
arguably
there
would
be
no
discrimination
against
males,
or
there
would
be
no
unequal
treatment
of
the
sexes,
but
that
is
not
the
case--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--if
the
sentences
were
the
same
and
the
substantive
elements
of
the
crime
were
the
same,
i
think
that
we
would
have
great
difficulty
with
an
equal
protection
tack...
i
agree.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
california
case
law
resoundingly
demonstrates
that
the
motivation
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute
is
the
concern
for
the
virtue
of
young
girls
and
not
the
pregnancy
prevention
rationale.
i
would
point
out
the
cases
cited
at
pages
25
and
26
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
these
cases
span
the
range
of
years
1895
through
1975--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--the
supreme
court
has
recently
said
otherwise
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--no,
your
honor,
this
court
is
not
bound
by
that
and
this
court
has
the
right
and
in
fact,
the
duty,
to
inquire
into
the
purposes
of
the
statute
where
the
purposes
reflect
upon
a
constitutional
claim.
otherwise,
the
state
courts,
by--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
this
court
has
the
duty
to
look
into
the--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--well
in
answer
to
that,
i
would
say
that
the
burden
of
demonstrating
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
on
the
government
in
this
case
and
that--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--there
is
a...
certainly
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
under
the
cases
in
this
court,
the
wengler
case,
that
it's
been
stated
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
make
out
the
claim
for
the
justification
of
stature.
i
believe
that
applies
here.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
will
have--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--well
i
believe
that
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
is
a
broad
presumption
which
applies
to
all
statutes
in
general.
but
once,
in
a
case,
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
is
made
out,
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
justify
the
classifications
of
the
statute.
i
believe
that
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
v.
hicks,
which
was
cited
in
our
brief,
a
recent
ninth
circuit
case
which
invalidated
a
federal
statute
which--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--it's
my
information
that
the
government
has
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari;
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
the
number
of
it,
but
it
was
filed
approximately
two
weeks
ago,
and
it's
also
my
information
that
the
government
has
asked
this
court
to
refrain
from
taking
any
action
in
the
hicks
case
until
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well
not
exactly,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
most
recent
california
supreme
court
case
is
only
1964,
it's
not
an
old
case.
the
most
recent
court
of
appeals
case
is
1975,
that
also
is
not
an
old
case.
it's
not
that
the
justifications
are--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--well
that's
certainly
part
of
it,
your
honor.
but
the
pregnancy
prevention
rationale
as
pointed
out
in
the
meloon
case
out
of
the
first
circuit,
is
suspect,
and
that
the
recent
eighth
circuit
case,
the
eighth
circuit
speaks
in
terms
of
pregnancy
prevention
as
being
a
suspect
justification
because
it's
so
readily
used
and
so
readily
available
to
justify
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
california
statute,
except
insofar--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--certainly.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
i
believe
in
the
cases
cited
in
my
brief,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
we
have
adequately
cited
authority
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
does
have
the
obligation
and
the
duty
to
look
beyond
the
state
court's
determination
of
what
the
purposes
of
the
statute
is.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--certainly,
yes.
however,
we
would
contend
and
we
have
contended
that
the
standard
of
craig
v.
boren
is
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well,
essentially,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
is
language
in
the
court's
opinions
in
the
past
that
do
delve
into
the
purposes
of
the
statutes
and
whether
or
not
the
classifications
served
are
substantially
related
to
those
purposes.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
essentially
none.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
there
really
is
none.
all
we
have
is
the
california
court
opinions,
basically.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well
i
think
as
a
general
proposition
that
that
is
certainly
correct.
however,
because
discrimination
in
this
case
is
based
upon
sex
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
make
out
the
claimed
justification.
of
course,
our
argument
here
is
that
this
is
based
on
heightened
scrutiny
because
of
the
disparate
effect
that
this
has
on
california
teenagers
particularly.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
in
this
case,
certainly;
and
as
between
males
and
females
of
all
ages
who
essentially
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
conduct,
be
it
reprehensible
or
not.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
no,
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--that
is
correct.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
be
fatally
wounded.
i
think
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
california
to
demonstrate
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
prevention
of
pregnancy
is
substantially
related
to...
or
that
the
classification
of
the
statute
is
substantially
related
to
that
purpose
because
it's
quite
overinclusive...
it
punishes
conduct
which
cannot
result
in
pregnancy.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well
the
test,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
classifications
have
to
be
substantially
related.
in
this
case,
sex,
the
male
gender
is
essentially
used
as
a
proxy
for
culpability,
and
we
contend
that
that's
an
imperfect
proxy.
there
is
a
weak
congruence.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well,
it--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--first
of
all,
the--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--yes,
it
certainly
is.
it's--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--well
first
of
all,
the...
the
harm
is
only
a
potential
harm,
and
certainly
it
occurs
with
some
frequency,
but
does
not
certainly
occur
in
every
case.
and,
furthermore,
at
the
time
the
teenage
couple
or
whoever
they
are,
decide
to
engage
in
sexual
intercourse,
the
risks
are
equally
apparent
to
the
female
as
well
as
to
the
male
and
the
female,
quite
voluntarily,
as
far
as--
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
--i'm
saying
she
is
equally
culpable
because
she
can
certainly
appreciate
the
dangers
and
risks
of
a
decision
to
engage
in
sexual
intercourse.
just
as
much
as
the
male.
there
is
no
showing
that
punishing
the
female
for
example,
or
punishing
the
male
instead
of
the
female,
is
any
more
effective
than
vice
versa,
really.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
well,
as
justice
mosk
stated,
this
goes
to
the
consequences
rather
than
the
reason
for
the
conduct
and
as
such,
is
irrelevant
in
weighing
the
female's
moral
culpability.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
certainly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
as
i
understand
the
osha
statutes,
none
of
them
classify
on
the
basis
of
sex;
none
of
them
define
conduct
for
males
that
is
hazardous
that
is
not
hazardous
for
females.
mr.
gregory
f.
jilka
yes,
that
is
certainly
true.
