justice
blackmun
counsel,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
california
situation?
could
he
have
been
charged...
well,
was
he
charged
with
a
felony?
justice
blackmun
could
he
have
been
charged
for
a
misdemeanor?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
your
supreme
court
has
said
otherwise
recently,
hasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
aren't
we
bound
by
that?
justice
blackmun
even
when
the
supreme
court
of
california
pronounces
what
the
purpose
of
their
statute
was?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know,
has
the
government
taken
appeal
on
that
one?
justice
blackmun
let
me
go
back
to
my
inquiry
about
the
california
courts'
observation
of
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
having
said
in
those
older
cases
what
the
purpose
was,
that
that's
engraved
in
stone,
the
supreme
court
of
california
now
may
not
look
at
the
same
material
and
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
justice
blackmun
you're
arguing
calendar,
then?
justice
blackmun
of
course
what
does
the
eighth
circuit
case
have
to
do
with
the
purpose
of
the
california
statute?
justice
blackmun
i'm
just
troubled
by
this
apparent
reversal
of
your
supreme
court
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
california
court,
and
i
am
troubled,
when
i
ask
it
doesn't
mean
that
i'm
fixed
on
my
answer
to
it--
justice
blackmun
--as
to
whether
we
are
not
bound
by
your
interpretation
of
the
purpose
of
their
statute.
justice
blackmun
mr.
kriegler,
do
prosecutors
in
california
always
press
these
as
felonies?
justice
blackmun
well,
where
is
the
line
of
distinction?
here
you
have
two
young
people
about
the
same
age,
one
year
and
18
days
apart,
and
you
press
it
as
a
felony?
justice
blackmun
well
i
read
the
appendix
thoroughly
and
i
would
say
the
particular
facts
would
seem
to
cut
the
other
way.
justice
blackmun
--well,
who
bought
the
liquor?
did
you
say
she
was
not
a
willing
participant--
justice
blackmun
--well
doesn't
the
appendix
show
that
she
began
the
intimacies?
justice
blackmun
making
out,
the
term
was
used,
and
objected
to
and
sustained.
