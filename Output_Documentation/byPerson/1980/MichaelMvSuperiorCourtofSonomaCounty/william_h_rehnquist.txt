justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
charge?
i
mean,
could
the
charge
possibly
embrace
forcible
as
well
as
statutory?
justice
rehnquist
counsel,
i
am
troubled,
as
apparently
some
of
my
colleagues
are,
by
the
rather
abstract
question
that's
presented.
ordinarily,
if
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
information
is
denied,
the
case
goes
to
trial.
and
we
have
testimony
and
a
verdict,
or
judges'
findings,
and
it
goes
on,
up
through
appeal
to
the
state
system
and
we
get
it
here
with
a
specific
batch
of
facts,
so
to
speak.
you
are
simply
challenging
the
statute
on
its
face?
justice
rehnquist
and
all
the
california
supreme
court
said
was
that,
on
its
face
this
statute
is
constitutional?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there...
there
is
one
thing
that
isn't
outmoded,
isn't
it,
and
that
is
that
women
can
have
children
and
men
can't?
justice
rehnquist
well
how
could
we
know
any
better
than
the
supreme
court
of
california
or
the
california
legislature
what
the
purpose
of
enacting
a
statute
was?
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
burden
of
the
state
to
make
out
the
justification
for
it?
justice
rehnquist
disparate
effect
as
between
teenaged
boys
and
teenaged
girls,
or--
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
osha,
for
instance,
that
the
risks
are
possible,
but
the
worker
may
not
fall
off
the
stepladder,
but
nonetheless,
the
government
has
the
perfect
right
to
say
there's
enough
of
a
chance
that
he
will
that
we're
going
to
make
sure
it's
safe.
justice
rehnquist
well
but
they
do...
they
do
allow
the
legislature
to
take
into
consideration...
that
the
legislature
has
taken
into
consideration
possible
risks
as
well
as
actual
consequences.
justice
rehnquist
well
how
about
venereal
disease?
justice
rehnquist
to
either
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
i
announce
is
only
that
of
a
plurality
of
the
court
but
the
judgment
is
that
of
a
majority.
petitioner
was
charged
with
violating
california's
statutory
rape
law.
that
law
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
man
to
have
sexual
intercourse
with
a
woman
who
is
not
his
wife
and
is
under
the
age
of
18
years.
petitioner
argued
that
the
statute
which
punishes
only
men
for
the
act
of
sexual
intercourse
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
because
it's
unlawfully
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
sex.
the
california
supreme
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
by
a
divided
vote.
it
reasoned
that
the
statute
was
a
permissible
attempt
due
to
teenage
pregnancy.
we
agree
and
affirm
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
not
all
laws
which
draw
distinctions
on
the
basis
of
sex
are
unconstitutional.
the
california
statutory
rape
law
is
designed
to
protect
young
women
from
the
harmful
effects
of
consequences
of
teenage
pregnancy
by
prohibiting
males
from
having
sexual
intercourse
with
young
females.
we
reject
petitioner's
contention
that
the
constitution
requires
a
state
to
make
young
woman
as
criminally
liable
as
young
men
for
the
same
conduct.
women
suffered
disproportionally
the
consequences
of
teenage
pregnancy
and
the
state
may
constitutionally
punish
only
males
because
they
suffer
few
of
the
consequences
of
the
--
of
their
acts.
accordingly,
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
justice
stewart,
while
joining
this
plurality
opinion,
he
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
in
which
he
concurs
in
the
judgment
reached
by
the
court.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
in
which
justices
white
and
marshall
have
joined.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
