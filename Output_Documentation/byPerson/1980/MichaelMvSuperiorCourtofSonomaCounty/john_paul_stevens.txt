justice

mr.
jilka,
could
i
interrupt
again,
because
i'm
always--
justice
stevens
--somewhat
puzzled
when
we
talk
about
constitutionality
as
applied
or
on
the
face,
the
case
arises
out
of...
doesn't
it
really
involve
a
test
of
the
legal
sufficiency
or
constitutionality
of
the
specific
complaint
filed
against
this
man?
justice
stevens
so,
don't
we
have
to
take
as
true,
for
purposes
of
decision,
whatever
facts
are
alleged
therein?
assuming
that--
justice
stevens
--they
will
prove
those
and
that
they
will
not
have
to
prove
anything
not
alleged
therein?
justice
stevens
well
that
is
not...
the
age
is
not
in
the
complaint
itself?
justice
stevens
mr.
jilka,
can
i
pursue
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you
about
washing
machines
and
cars?
did
you
focus
entirely
on
protection
of
the
victim
being
sex
neutral
or
are
you
also
focusing
at
all
on
the
punishment?
in
other
words,
are
you
in
effect
arguing
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
have
a
statute
that
said
it's
unlawful
for
men
to
steal
cars
but
there
is
no
prohibition
against
women
stealing
cars?
justice
stevens
that's
more,
that's
your
position?
but
you
told
us
that
women
can
be
guilty
of
violating
this
statute?
justice
stevens
of
this
year.
thank
you.
mr.
jilka,
excuse
me
again
for
interrupting.
mr.
justice
stewart
made
the
point
about
aiders
and
abettors
and
you
said
they
are
equally
culpable
and
equally
punishable.
doesn't
that
entirely
destroy
your
case?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
what's
the
discrimination
if
both
the
male
and
the
female
can
be
punished
equally
and
there
can't
be
a
crime
unless
they
are
both
liable
for
some
kind
of
punishment?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
by
hypothesis
it's
either
voluntary
or
involuntary
on
the
part
of
the
female;
and
if
it's
involuntary,
why
then
you've
got
a
forcible
rape
situation.
justice
stevens
and
you're
not
challenging
that?
justice
stevens
if
it's
voluntary,
then
don't
you,
by
hypothesis,
have
an
aiding
and
abetting
situation?
justice
stevens
mr.
kriegler,
would
either
of
those
purposes
be
served
any
less
well
by
a
statute
that
was
entirely
neutral
that
applied
to
the
female
as
well
as
the
male?
justice
stevens
well
why
not?
it's
perfectly
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
it
would
apply
to
a
consensual
act
between
17-year
olds.
justice
stevens
but
do
you
not
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
a
consensual
act
between
two
17-year
olds
of
opposite
sexes
who
are
equally
culpable?
yes,
you
do.
justice
stevens
they
why
do
we
have
to
argue
about
anything
else?
justice
stevens
well
why
is
it
important
if
you're
defending
the
statute--
--how
do
we
know
that?
you're
just--
--instead
of
the
prosecution?
--and
there's
been
no
trial
and
no
finding
of
fact,
so
we
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not.
justice
stevens
you
say
that
the
reason
it
serves
it
better
than
a
sex
neutral
statute
is
that
after
the
act
has
been
committed,
then
there's
a
greater
likelihood
that
it
will
be
reported
by
the
female?
justice
stevens
but
in
terms
of
the
deterrence
of
the
conduct
itself,
is
it
not
clear
that
if
the
penalty
applied
to
both,
there
would
be
less
likelihood
of
the
risk-creating
conduct
taking
place?
right.
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
the
female
should
ever
be
punished
for
engaging
in
this
kind
of
conduct
as
a
deterrent
to
further
examples
of
the
same
kind
of
conduct?
justice
stevens
would
it
be
rational
for
a
parent
to
say
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
my
sons
to
do
this,
but
it's
wrong
for
my
daughters
to
do
this
and
therefore
i
will
punish
my
sons
but
not
my
daughters?
that's
what
the
state
is
doing.
justice
stevens
well
it's
always
a
risk-creating
act,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
it
takes
two
participants
every
time
the
act
is
performed,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
if
it's
consensual,
why
should
one
be
punished
and
not
the
other
one?
justice
stevens
has
the
legislature
reasonably
concluded
that
those
risks
have
been
sufficient
to
deter
females
from
voluntarily
engaging
in
this
kind
of
conduct?
justice
stevens
isn't
that
because
there's
a
greater
moral
stigma
to
this
act
if
it's
performed
by
an
unmarried
female
than
by
an
unmarried
male?
justice
stevens
well,
does
california,
is
it
the
policy
of
the
state
of
california
to
place
greater
importance
on
the
chastity
of
the
female
than
on
the
chastity
of
the
male?
justice
stevens
in
moral
terms?
justice
stevens
then
mr.
justice
stewart
is
suggesting
you
should
face
up
to
that,
and
i'm
wondering
whether,
in
facing
up
to
that,
you
are
contending
there
is
a
distinction
in
the,
in
the
morality
of
the
act,
depending
on
the
sex
of
the
person
who
participated.
or
that's
really...
you
don't
have
to
contend
that.
just--
--or
you
rely
entirely
on
pregnancy--
--california
legislature
determined
to
protect
the
chastity
of
minor
females,
not
of
all
people
of
all
ages,
or
of
both
sexes,
and
your
opponent's
argument
is
that
california
is
constitutionally
required,
if
it
protects
minor
females
to
at
least
protect
minor
males.
we
don't
have
here
the
question
of
whether
it
also
is
constitutionally
required
to
protect
the
chastity
of
males
and
females
of
all
ages
but
that
would
be
the
next
case.
you
certainly
must
argue...
you
certainly
must
argue
that
the
consequences,
apart
from
any
moral
issue,
the
consequences
socially,
economically
and
in
various
other
ways,
are
much
greater
on
the
girl,
is
that
not
so?
justice
stevens
is
it
your
argument
that
there
would
be
less
of
a
deterrent
if
it
was
also
unlawful
for
the
female
to
engage
in
sexual
intercourse
at
this
age;
that
that
would
be
a
lesser
deterrent
to
pregnancy?
justice
stevens
enforcement
problem,
you've
identified
that.
justice
stevens
but
in
terms
of
the
actual
conduct
you
seek
to
deter,
you
don't
have
statistics
about
that,
do
you?
i
mean,
isn't
there
a
large
volume
of
conduct
in
which
the
participants
are
both
young
persons?
justice
stevens
and
you
think
that
you
would
not
be
as
equally
effective
in
deterring
that
conduct
if
you
also
imposed
a
penalty
on
the
female
for
engaging
in
it?
justice
stevens
because
of
these
enforcement
problems
you
describe?
justice
stevens
well
if
it's
not
the
case
then
you
have
no
rational
basis
for
the
discrimination.
you
may
have
a
rational
basis
for
the
prohibition,
but
you
have
to
justify
why
do
we
make
it
just
as
to
one
and
not
the
other?
justice
stevens
let
me
give
you
an
example
which
i've
reflected
on.
supposing
you
had
a
law
that
made
it
reckless
driving
to
drive
on
a
motorcycle
at
excessive
rate
of
speed.
and
you
said
well,
if
a
person
doesn't
wear
a
helmet,
he'll
suffer
greater
harm
if
he
has
an
accident,
so
we
will
exclude
people
who
do
not
wear
helmets
from
the
prohibition
against
reckless
driving.
under
your
rationale
that
would
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
exclusion,
is
that
not
right?
justice
stevens
because
they
suffer
a
greater
risk
of
harm,
therefore
you
don't
need
to
deter
them
with
legal
sanctions?
justice
stevens
and
that's
your
argument
about
the
female;
she
suffers
a
greater
risk
of
harm,
and
therefore,
she
should
not
be
deterred.
she
should
know
intelligently,
no
matter
how
young
she
is,
that
she
should
not
do
this.
justice
stevens
is
it
part
of
your
position
that
the
male
participant
never
suffers
any
adverse
consequences
other
than
legal
prohibition?
justice
stevens
there's
financial
responsibility,
sometimes.
there's
physical
harm,
sometimes,
isn't
there?
justice
stevens
how
about
an
irate
father?
