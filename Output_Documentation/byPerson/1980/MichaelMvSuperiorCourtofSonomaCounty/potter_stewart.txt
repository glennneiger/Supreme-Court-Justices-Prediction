justice
stewart
so,
as
you
say,
the
suggestion
that
force
was
used
is
irrelevant
because
the
issue
before
us
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute
on
its
face--
justice
stewart
--is
that
correct?
so
it's
equally
irrelevant
that
michael
was
17
years
old?
justice
stewart
he
was
not...
i
mean,
if
you're
right
on
the
first--
justice
stewart
--the
second
follows.
justice
stewart
i
thought
that
michael
was
a
male?
justice
stewart
well
if
we're
going
to
get
into
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
then
the...
and
if
this
is
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied,
then
both
the
matter
that
you've
been
discussing
and
the
age
of
your
client
are,
perhaps,
relevant.
but
if
the
issue
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
statute
on
its
face,
then
neither
the
alleged
facts
of
this
episode,
nor
the
age
of
the
defendant,
are
really
relevant,
are
they?
justice
stewart
women
can
become
pregnant
and
men
can't?
justice
stewart
is
it
your
basic...
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
is
it
your
basic
contention
that
california
could
have
enacted
a
law
such
as
this,
if
it
applied
not
only
to
both
men
and
women,
but
to
people
of
all
ages,
victims
of
all
ages?
justice
stewart
why
not?
justice
stewart
well,
then
is
it...
is
it
your
submission
that
california
could
have
enacted
a
law
such
as
this
if
it
had
applied
to
victims
of
both
sexes?
justice
stewart
under
17?
justice
stewart
although
the
next
claim
would
be
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
california
to
do
that
for
people
under
17,
when
it
didn't
do
it
for
people
over
17?
justice
stewart
it
would
be
a
different
case,
but
it
would
be
a
constitutional
challenge,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
so
it's
your
claim
that
california,
having...
cannot
enact
this
for
the
protection
of
women
alone;
that
if
it
enacts
this,
it
has
to
go
the
whole
hog
and
enact
it
for
the
protection
of
all
people
of
either
sex
under
17
years
old?
justice
stewart
wouldn't
it
follow
that
a
state
that
passed
a
law
to
protect
the
purchasers
of
automobiles
would
have
to
pass
a
law
to
protect
the
purchasers
of
dishwashers?
justice
stewart
well
isn't
that
pretty
much
what
your
argument
is?
justice
stewart
california,
if
it
tries
to
protect
females,
must
protect
males
also?
justice
stewart
that
the
constitution
requires
it
to
do
so?
justice
stewart
yes.
then,
that
would
be
true
of
forcible
rape
as
well
as
statutory
rape?
justice
stewart
can
women
be
guilty
of
the
offense
under
this
california
statute
as
aiders
and
abettors?
justice
stewart
accessories?
justice
stewart
and
california,
does...
does
california
generally
treat
aiders
and
abettors
the
same
as
principals,
as
far
as
sentences
go?
justice
stewart
do
you
know
the
federal
criminal
law
generally
does?
justice
stewart
that
case
is
not
in
your
brief,
i
gather?
justice
stewart
what's
the
style
of
it,
the
citation?
justice
stewart
will
you
do
that?
justice
stewart
preisser?
justice
stewart
eighth
circuit?
justice
stewart
september?
justice
stewart
well
i
suppose
a
good
many
men
who
violate
the
statute
are
not
charged
with
it?
justice
stewart
so
that's
no
answer,
in
other
words.
justice
stewart
so
your
answer
to
my
brother
stevens
was
really
no
answer
to
his
question.
moreover
i
imagine
that
in
these
states
that
have
sex
neutral
statutes
like
this,
probably
most
of
the
prosecutions
are
males
anyway.
justice
stewart
there
is
a
case
in
the
federal
system
that
said
that
the
so-called
victim
in
a
mann
act
prosecution,
could
be
guilty
of
conspiracy
of
her
own...
to
carrying
on
her
own
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
for
immoral
purposes;
wouldn't
the
same
principal
apply?
justice
stewart
well
what
real
difference
does
it
make
what
the
legislative
purpose
was?
i
know
that
a
good
deal
of
time
was
spent
by
both
you
and
your
brother,
in
your
briefs,
in
talking
about
the
purpose
but
isn't
it
the
duty
of
this
court
to
look
at
the
statute
on
its
face
and
to,
depending
upon
what
level
of
so-called
scrutiny
one
wants
to
apply,
to
uphold
the
statute
if
a
rational
basis
can
be
conceived
for
its
existence?
justice
stewart
isn't
it
a
pretty
elusive
quest
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
purpose
of
the
california
legislature
was,
back
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
maybe
the
various
members
of
the
legislature
who
voted
for
the
statute
had
a
variety
of
purposes?
justice
stewart
regardless
of
the
original
purpose
or
the
present
purpose
or
whatever
this
california
supreme
court
said
about
its
purpose,
the
duty
of
this
court
is
to
look
at
the
statute
and
its
impact
and,
depending
upon,
as
i
say,
the
level
of
so-called
scrutiny
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
rationally
based.
isn't
that
about
it?
justice
stewart
is
there
any
legislative
history
of
this
state
legislation
that
one
can
look
at?
justice
stewart
--but
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
one
of
my
earlier
questions,
you
don't
attack
this
statute
on
the
basis
that
it
protects
people
only
under
17
years
old?
justice
stewart
it
punishes
males
of
any
age,
does
it
not?
justice
stewart
well,
mr.
kriegler,
if
the
issue
before
us
is
the
constitutional
validity
on
its
face
of
this
california
legislation,
what
in
the
world
do
the
facts
of
this
case
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
stewart
not
very
many
have.
the
point
is,
must
be,
i
think,
that
the
risk
of
pregnancy
is
a
deterrence
with
respect
to
the
female,
and--
justice
stewart
--and
in
order
to...
and
there
is
no
such
deterrence
with
respect
to
the
male.
and
in
order
to
deter
the
male
this
statute
is
necessary,
applicable
to
males
who
indulge
in
this
conduct,
but
not
females
because
they
are
equivalently
deterred
by
the
risk
of
pregnancy,
or
the
fear
of
pregnancy,
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
stewart
mr
kriegler,
really,
i
don't...
i
either
didn't
understand
in
reading
your
briefs,
or
your
opponent's
briefs,
why
you
run
away
from
the
idea
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
protect
the
chastity
of
minor
females
and
don't
face
up
to
the
fact
that
your
opponent
argues
that
california
is
constitutionally
prohibited
from
passing
such
legislation
unless
it
also
protects...
legislation
to
protect
the
chastity
of
minor
males.
justice
stewart
that's
the
argument.
justice
stewart
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
stewart
well
in
this
case,
you
protect
only
females,
because
it
applies
only
when
females
are
victims.
justice
stewart
but
the
argument
is
that
california
is
constitutionally
disabled
from
enacting
any
such
legislation
and
that
it
is
constitutionally
required
to
protect
also
minor
males,
if
it
protects
minor
females.
now
that's
a
very
odd
argument,
and
you
haven't
done
it
at
all.
