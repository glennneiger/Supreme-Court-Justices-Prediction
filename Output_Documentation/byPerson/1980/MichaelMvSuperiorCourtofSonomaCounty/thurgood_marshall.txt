also,
she
might
be
less
anxious
to
commit
it,
too,
wouldn't
she?
justice
marshall
i
thought
maybe--
justice
marshall
and
you
say
he
was
a
perfect
stranger?
justice
marshall
when
you
say
the
record
may
show,
doesn't
the
record
actually
show
that
she
rode
around
in
the
police
car
to
pick
him
out
on
the
street?
justice
marshall
doesn't
the
record
show
that?
justice
marshall
well
you
don't
go
around
looking
for
people
that
you
know,
do
you?
you
go
to
their
home
or
where
ever
they
are
to
pick
them
out.
justice
marshall
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
first
statute
was
passed
in
1850,
right?
justice
marshall
and
it
applied
to
girls
10
years
old,
right?
justice
marshall
is
there
any
literature
that
shows
that
there
was
a
rash
of
pregnancies
among
9
year
olds
in
1850?
justice
marshall
well
when
did
it
change
to
pregnancy?
justice
marshall
and
i'm
going
to
ask
for
a
citation
when
you
answer.
justice
marshall
have
you
ever
heard
of
anything
more
speculative
than
that
in
your
life?
justice
marshall
sure.
justice
marshall
did
it
change
its
statute?
justice
marshall
subsequently?
justice
marshall
three
years
later?
justice
marshall
when
you
talk
about
the
sexual
aggressor,
would
that
be...
a
person
that
plied
somebody
with
liquor?
justice
marshall
and
isn't
that
what
happened
in
this
case?
justice
marshall
well
she...
she
drank
it
herself?
justice
marshall
but
if
he'd
given
it
to
her,
he'd
have
been
the
aggressor?
justice
marshall
i
hope
not.
