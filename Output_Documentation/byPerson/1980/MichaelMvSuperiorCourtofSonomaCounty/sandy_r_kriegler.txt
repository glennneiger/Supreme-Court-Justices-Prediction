mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
deputy
attorney
general
sandy
r.
kriegler,
appearing
today
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
california,
real
party
in
interest.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
constitutionality
of
california
penal
code
section
261.5,
in
light
of
the
tests
set
forth
by
this
court
for
gender
based
classifications,
in
craig
v.
boren.
under
craig
v.
boren,
classifications
based
upon
gender
are
constitutional
if
they
serve
important
governmental
objectives,
and
if
the
classification
scheme
is
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
those
objectives.
this
court
has
recognized
that
classifications
based
upon
gender
are
not
invalid,
per
se.
indeed,
where
the
sexes
are
not
similarly
situated
or
in
those
situations
where
society
imposes
special
burdens
upon
females,
different
treatment
is
allowed.
we
believe
that
the
classification
under
the
statute
before
the
court
today
is
based
upon
physiological
differences
which
do
not
reflect
the
type
of
invidious
discrimination
which
the
equal
protection
clause
prohibits.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
no,
your
honor.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
i
believe
it
was
pressed
as
a
felony
in
this
case
due
to
the
particular
facts
involved.
and
these
particular
facts
are
revealed
in
the
appendix--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
your
honor,
the
prosecutor
obviously
disagreed
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
victim
clearly
testified,
under
oath
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
that
she
submitted
to
the
act
of
intercourse
only
after
being
slugged
in
the
face
2
to
3
times
with
sufficient
force
to
leave
bruises.
we
believe
that
this
case,
while
it
is
not
perhaps
sufficient
to
constitute
a
forcible
rape,
or
at
least
the
prosecutor
who
filed
the
charges
did
not
feel
so,
it
certainly
approached
that.
and
it
was
above
the
level
of
consensual
intercourse,
that
one
might
normally
expect
to
be
involved
in
a
situation
involving
two
minors.
certainly,
the
use
of
force,
i
feel,
was
the
crucial
factor
in
the
prosecutor's
decision
to
file
this
case
as
a
felony.
i
would
point
out,
however,
to
the
court
that
the
case
was
originally
filed
in
juvenile
court,
and
the
petitioner
was
found
unfit
for
treatment
under
the
juvenile
court
law
and
then
it
came
to
adult
court.
so
the
initial
filing
was
not
even
as
a
felony,
it
was
under
our
juvenile
court
law
under
which
there
are
no
felonies
or
misdemeanors;
it
is
not
a
criminal
branch
of
our
judiciary.
we
believe
that
the
important
governmental
interests
served
by
penal
code
section
261.5
are
the
deterrence
of
teenage
pregnancy,
the
prevention
of
physical
injury
to
minor
females
from
sexual
intercourse.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
absolutely,
your
honor,
particularly
in
this
case.
if
our
statute
were
gender
neutral
in
this
case,
the
victim,
sharon,
would
be,
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
subject
to
prosecution.
if
she
were
subject
to
prosecution,
first
of
all,
she
would
be
less
likely
to
report
the
incident,
because
to
do
would
be
to
incriminate
herself.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
she
may,
your
honor,
but
in
view
of
the--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
just
point
out
that
in
view
of
the
testimony
that
she
gave
under
oath,
she
was
not
a
willing
participant
in
this
act;
she
submitted--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--she
was
not
a
willing
participant.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
your
honor,
she
engaged
in
a
certain
amount
of
kissing,
apparently,
from
the
record,
with
the
defendant.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
i
believe
that
was
mr.
jilka's
term
that
he
used
in
the
preliminary
hearing.
however,
it's
clear
that
she
did
not
wish
to
go
further
and
proceed
to
an
act
of
intercourse.
and
indeed,
in
that
act
she
bore
all
the
risks
of
the
potential
pregnancy,
she
was
not
willing
to
engage
in
the
act,
at
least
as
far
as
the
record
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
i
believe
the
record
indicates
she
may
have
known
the
petitioner.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
that--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well
all
i'm
saying
is,
she
may
have
been
familiar
with
the
individual,
i
don't
know
that
she
was
a
personal
friend
or
a
close
acquaintance--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
we
believe
the
statute
is
constitutional
on
its
face
for
the
reasons
set
forth
by
the
california
supreme
court.
it
is
petitioner
who
has
come
before
this
court
urging
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him
because
he
is
also
a
minor.
that
is
the
only
reason
that
the
as-applied
argument
is
being
made.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
we
agree.
and
our
only
point
would
be
that
insofar
as
petitioner
is
pursuing
the
argument
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him
as
a
17-year
old,
he
cannot
have
it
both
ways;
he
cannot
straddle
the
fence
and
say
it's
unconstitutional
to
apply
this
to
me
as
a
minor,
on
the
other
hand
ignoring
the
specific
conduct
that
he
engaged
in--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--that
is
not
the
facts
before
this
court.
the
statute
on
its
face
applies
to
all
forms
of--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
we
certainly
do.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
because
it's
important
to
point
out,
in
this
case,
the
two
17-year
olds
were
not
equally
culpable.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
trial.
however,
whether
the
parties
are
engaged
in
the
type
of
conduct
that
occurred
in
this
case
or
as
your
honor
suggests,
whether
we
view
the
statute
on
its
face,
we
submit
that
the
statute
is
nonetheless
constitutional
because
it
serves
these
two
important
governmental
interests
that
i
have
mentioned
and--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--right--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
females
have--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
i
think
the
state
might...
the
state
legislature
might,
in
the
exercise
of
its
sound
judgment,--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances,
your
honor,
and
the
act--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--it
is,
but
the
risks
are
borne
uniquely
by
the
female.
but
it
might--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
it
does,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
one
should
be
punished
because
the
california
legislature
has
determined
that
the
female
bears
these
extraordinary
risks
from
the
act
of
intercourse;
because
of
these
extraordinary
risks
which
petitioner
has
conceded
in
it's
brief,
to
be
compelling
state
interests,
the
legislature
has
reasonably
concluded,
we
believe,
that
the
sexes
are
not
similarly
situated.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well,
the
question
of
deterrence
is
one
that
is
very
difficult
to
answer;
we
don't
know
how
many
people
have
or
have
not
been
deterred
by
the
existence
of
this
statute,
or
any
other
statute.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
i
submit--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
that
is
correct.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
no.
we
are
quite
confident
that
the
statute
as
originally
enacted
in
1950
was
intended
to
prevent
physical
injury
to
minor
females,
9
year
olds
certainly,
at
that
time--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
the
statute--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--fine.
the
statute,
mr.
justice
marshall,
was
amended
incrementally,
at
three
stages:
the
age
of
the
protection
for
the
female
raised
to
14,
16,
and
eventually
18,
in
1913.
we
believe
that
while
there
is
no
concrete
legislative
history
to
support
the
reasoning
for
those
increases,
certainly
one
inference
that
could
reasonably
be
drawn
as
the
age
of
the
victim
increased
the
possibility
of
pregnancy
occurring
was
more
frequent.
now--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--your
honor,
there
are
some
additional
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
regard
to
the
question
of
legislative
intent,
if
i
might?
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
in
1967,
california
passed
its
therapeutic
abortion
act,
and
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
that
of
course
was
well
prior
to
the
time
that
this
court
enunciated
the
rule
that
abortions
were
constitutionally
mandated...
must
be
made
available.
in
that
act,
the
one
category
of
victim
that
was
specifically
named
as
being
unconditionally
eligible
for
abortion
was
statutory
rape
victims
under
our
former
statutory
rape
law;
california
penal
code
section
261
subdivision
1.
because
that
particular
category
of
victim
under
section
261
subdivision
1,
was
specifically
singled
out
as
being
eligible
for
abortion,
we
believe
that
it's
very
clear
at
least
at
that
time,
the
legislature
perceived
the
purpose
of
the
statutory
rape
law,
at
least
in
part,
as
being
intended
to
deter
teenage
pregnancies.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
yes,
your
honor.
subsequently
the
statute
was
repealed--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
in
1970,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
present
edition
of
the
statute,
penal
code
section
261.5,
was
enacted,
it
was
taken
out
of
the
former
rape
section,
and
it
was
called
unlawful
sexual
intercourse.
we
believe
that
since
that
occurred
three
years
after
the
legislative
deferration
of...
the
connection
between
statutory
rape
and
teenage
pregnancy--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
the
same
legislature.
but
certainly,
i
think,
that
is
the
most
recent
indication,
at
least
at
that
time,
of
what
the
legislatures'
thinking
was
in
regards
to
the
purpose
of
the
statutory
rape
law.
i
would
also
point--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
first
of
all--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i
don't
think
that
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
because
there's--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--no
chastity
requirement.
well,
there's
no
chastity
requirement
in
our
statute,
number
one.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well,
certainly
there
is
a
direct
correlation
between
the
frequency
of
intercourse
today
and
the
resulting
pregnancies;
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
my
point
is--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--that
is
correct,
and
we
also
protect
minor
males.
i
don't
want
to
leave
this
court
with
the
false--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--because
of--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well,
our
response
is
that
california
is
not
constitutionally
required
to
treat
dissimilarly
situated
sexes
the
same
way.
we
have
established
that
the
very
narrow
category
of
victim
in
this
case
is
in
need
of
special
protection.
minor
males
are
not
in
need
of
the
same
protection.
that
is
not
to
say,
however,
that
minor
males
do
not
get
protection
under
the
california
laws.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
i
don't
think
it
is
necessarily
a
moral
stigma,
it
may
be
a
basis
of...
of--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i
don't
think--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i
don't
think
it
turns
upon
the
question
of
chastity,
your
honor.
i
think
it
turns
upon--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--that
is
the
entire
basis
of
our
argument.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
once
the
statutory
purposes
of
deterring
these
teenage
pregnancies,
and
as
mr.
chief
justice
has,
thankfully,
pointed
out...
the
consequences
of
these
pregnancies
are
just
disastrous
on
minor
females.
eight
out
of
ten
never
complete
high
school;
60
percent
end
up
on
welfare
within
2
to
5
years.
the
consequences
are
medically
disastrous,
the--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i
think
there
would
be
a
problem
involved
in
it,
and
i
started
to
answer,
i
think,
the
same
question
a
little
bit
earlier
and
i
didn't
quite
get
to
complete
my
answer.
first--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well,
it
even
goes
beyond
the
problem
of
reporting.
if
the
statute
were
gender
neutral,
the
female
would
be
culpable
also
as
an
aider
and
abettor,
or
a
principal,
in
this
case.
that
creates
problems
of
who
is
the
state
going
to
prosecute;
the
male
or
the
female?
well
that's
a
judgment
call
on
the
part
of
prosecutors.
you
start
getting
into
the
question
of
is
this
particular
case
a
discriminatory
prosecution?
so
we
have
a
hearing
in
which
this
minor
female
who
is
supposed
to
be
protected
by
the
statute,
goes
through
all
the
facts
again
and
we
decide
whether
it's
a
discriminatory
prosecution
or
not.
but
even
if
we
were
to
say
that
she
should
be
protected
under
the
statute,
that
creates
another
problem
in
california,
because
she,
as
an
accomplice
or
an
aider
or
abettor,
must
have
her
testimony
corroborated
under
california
penal
code
section
111.1.
and
under
that
section,
her
testimony
standing
by
itself
won't
be
sufficient
to
constitute
substantial
evidence
for
a
conviction
under
california
law.
these
acts
are,
by
and
large,
committed
in
privacy.
this
would
be
a
very
substantial
problem
for
the
state
of
california
to
enforce
its
law,
if
we
had
a
gender
neutral
statute.
when
we
add
to
that
the
fact
that
in
the
great
majority
of
these
cases,
the
perpetrator
is
the
adult...
is
an
adult.
we
have
cited
statistics
in
our
brief
which
show
that
it's
a
very
rare
case
indeed
that
a
minor
male
is
prosecuted.
perhaps
only
one--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i'm
sure
there
is,
your
honor,
yes.
i
don't
think
we
can
deny
that
fact.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well
it
may
or
may
not
be--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
it
may
or
may
not
be
the
case.
many
states--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well
i
think
it
goes
beyond
the
enforcement
problems.
there
i
come
back
to
our
original
point,
the
statute
is
based
upon
deterring
the
particular
harmful--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--i...
i--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--well,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well,
this
statute,
your
honor,
is
consistent
with
all
of
the
california
laws
which
prohibit
sexual
offenses
with
minors,
whether
they
be
male
or
females.
under
california
law
where
the
minor
is
protected
from
acts
involving
lewd
or
lascivious
conduct,
or
annoying
or
molesting
that
child
or
other
acts
of
sex
perversion,
it
matters
not
whether
the
minor
who
engages
in
those
acts
with
the
adult
counterpart
is
acting
consensually
or
not.
the
statute
is
there
for
the
protection
of
that
particular
individual,
because
of
the
consequences
of
the
act.
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
act
is
consensual
or
not;
the
severe
consequences
to
the
minor
victim
in
all
of
our
california
statutes,
are
recognized,
because
the
minors
are
not
treated
as
being
culpable
for
the
crime
that's
committed.
when
the
female
in
this
case
is
properly
viewed
as
the
victim
and
is
properly
viewed
as
suffering
disparate
consequences
from
the
act
of
intercourse,
none
of
which
whatever
are
borne
by
the
male
who
engages
in
the
act
of
intercourse,
we
believe
that
the
statute
does
not
contain--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--we
are
unaware
of
any
substantial
adverse
consequences
to
the
minor
male.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
we
are
unaware
of
any--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--that
is
a
potential
harm
that
both
suffer.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
that
may
be
a
more
practical
consideration,
i
don't
know.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well
i
think
that's
pretty
tenuous,
particularly
in
this
case,
where,
you
know,
we
have
a
minor
male
participant.
i
really--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
we
would,
for
the
same
reasons
that
i
stated
previously.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out,
and
emphasize
this
fact
most
strongly
to
the
court,
after
all
the
research
that
has
been
done
in
this
case,
petitioner
has
yet
to
cite
to
a
single
instance
where
the
statute
has
been
applied
in
an
unfair
manner
as
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white's
question.
we
believe
that
the
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
was
clearly
applied
to
the
sexual
aggressor.
the
cases
that
are
decided
in
california
under
our--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--yes,
your
honor,
definitely
it
would.
i
would
simply
point
out,
though--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--could
possibly,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
i
believe
the
girl
drank
her
own
liquor
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
she
plied
anybody
with
liquor.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
yes,
she
did,
certainly.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
base
our--
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
--on
that
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
sandy
r.
kriegler
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
strongly
urge
this
court
to
recognize
the
severe
consequences
that
befall
only
the
teenage
female
participant
in
an
act
of
intercourse,
regardless
of
the
age
of
the
male
participant.
and
with
the
court
being
aware,
as
it
is,
of
the
consequences
of
teenage
pregnancy,
i
don't
need
to
remind
the
court
certainly
of
the
statements
made
in
earlier
cases.
i
know,
mr.
justice
powell
speaking
for
the
court
in
bellotti
v.
baird
certainly
recognized
that
the
consequences
of
pregnancy,
severe
as
they
are
to
an
adult
woman,
are
even
more
severe
to
the
unwed,
teenage
mother.
california
legislature
has
recognized
the
disastrous
consequences
of
teenage
pregnancy
and
sexual
abuse
of
minor
females
in
the
state
of
california.
the
problem
is
conceded
by
petitioner
to
be
one
of
monumental
proportions.
the
state
of
california
has
made
the
valid
judgment
that
in
view
of
the
risks
which
are
borne
only
by
the
minor
female,
none
of
which
are
suffered
by
the
minor
male,
that
criminal
sanctions
should
be
employed
as
it
is,
under
california
penal
code
section
261.5.
we
ask
this
court
to
leave
intact
california
penal
code
section
261.5
because
of
the
degree
of
protection
it
provides
to
this
particular
class
of
individual
is
so
needing
in
that
protection.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
