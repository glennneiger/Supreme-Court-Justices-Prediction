justice
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
roth,
are
you
going
to
touch
at
some
point
in
your
oral
argument
on
the
equal
footing
doctrine
of
pollard
v.
hagan?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
can
one
reconcile
that
concession
in
namen
with
the
holding
of
the
9th
circuit
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
montana
does
not
own
the
bed
of
the
river
in
question?
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't
that
have
raised
some
constitutional
implications
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
which
is
a
part
of
the
constitution--
justice
rehnquist
--well,
there's
some
tension
here,
isn't
there,
between
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
the
choctaw
case?
justice
rehnquist
and
what
is
your
response
to
the
equal
footing
argument?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
corvallis
case,
then?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
suggest
that
the
result
in
this
case
would
have
been
different
had
it
been
brought
by
non-indian
residents
and
owners
of
land
on
the
reservation?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
plaintiff
is
the
state
of
montana,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
talks
about
the
state,
about
the
state,
and
i
guess
implicitly
it
means
all
the
residents
of
the
state.
justice
rehnquist
the
general
public.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
from
shively
v.
bowlby
about,
upon
which
you
apparently
rely,
where
the
court
says,
"although
the
title
to
the
soil
under
the
tidewaters
of
the
bay.
"
--and
this
is
san
francisco
bay...
"was
acquired
by
the
united
states
by
cession
from
mexico
equally
with
the
title
to
the
upland.
"
"they
held
it
only
in
trust
for
the
future
state.
"
how
can
you
hold
something
in
trust
for
a
future
state
and
yet
convey
it
away?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lynaugh,
you
rely
rather
heavily
in
your
brief
on
alaska
pacific
fishery
v.
united
states;
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
that
case
where
the
court
says
about
reservation
v.
alaska,
"the
reservation
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
private
grant
but
simply
a
setting
apart
of
until
otherwise
provide
by
law
of
designated
public
property
for
a
recognized
public
purpose.
"
would
you
not
say
that
the
admission
of
a
state
to
the
union
came
within
the
definition
of
"as
otherwise
provided
by
law"
in
that
language?
justice
rehnquist
then
that...
the
language,
"as
otherwise
provided
by
law"
would
not
include
an
act
of
congress
admitting
a
state
to
the
union?
justice
rehnquist
it
was;
there's
no
question.
but--
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
that
language
rather
than
other
language
of
the
decision?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
limits?
