mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
major
concern
to
the
tribe
in
this
case
has
been
the
claim
of
sport
fishing
by
non-indians
on,
over,
and
in
primarily
the
big
horn
river.
in
recent
years
the
river
has
become
known
as
a
very
good,
in
fact
a
blue
ribbon
trout
stream,
and
has
attracted
many
non-indians
from
montana
and
across
the
nation.
plaintiffs'
exhibit
30,
which
appears
at
page
25,
volume
ii,
of
the
joint
appendix
indicates
surveys
that
have
been
taken
of
the
fishermen
on
various
weekends
in
1973.
one
of
the
major
concerns
of
the
tribe
is
illustrated
in
that
survey,
and
that
is,
the
majority
of
people
who
are
fishing
on
the
river,
and
the
majority
of
the
people
who
are
duck
hunting
in
the
vicinity
of
the
river
and
over
the
river
are
non-indians
who
are
not
local
residents,
but
rather
non-indians
who
come
from
the
major
population
centers
in
the
other
parts
of
montana,
or
non-indians
who
come
from
other
states.
the
concern
of
the
tribe
is
two-fold.
it's
to
conserve
the
fish
and
game
within
its
reservation,
within
the
totality
of
the
boundaries
of
that
reservation,
as
a
food
source
for
itself.
and
also,
it
has
concern
about
the
uncontrolled
influx
of
non-indians
into
the
river
area,
and
believes
that
this
will
seriously
affect
the
tribe
as
an
entity.
this
reservation
is
a
continuing
indian
reservation.
seventy
percent
of
the
land
is
owned
in
trust.
the
majority
of
the
population
are
indian
residents.
the
communities
within
the
reservation,
the
population
centers,
are
indian
communities,
not
primarily
non-indian
communities.
the
reservation
itself,
as
a
governmental
entity,
is
divided
into
various
districts
which
accord
with
the
population
centers.
we
believe
that
since
the
major
problem
is
the
hunting
and
fishing
in,
over,
and
on
the
big
horn
river...
and
that's
the
issue
presented
in
this
case...
that
the
problem
would
be
resolved,
we
believe,
by
a
decision
on
the
issue
of
ownership
of
the
riverbed,
a
decision
that
would
say
that
he
riverbed
is
owned
by
the
tribe.
this
river
is
not
a
commercial
fishery.
there
are
no
competing
economic
impacts
between
treaty
fishermen
and
non-treaty
fishermen.
there
is
no
natural
run
of
the
fishery
beyond
the
reservation
boundaries,
downstream.
it's
a
local
fishery.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
your
honor,
it
is
now
stocked
by
the
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
in
conjunction
with
the
tribe.
the
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
does
the
stocking.
prior
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--the
state
of
montana
has
done
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
there
was
a
fishery,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--that's
right.
there--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
no,
your
honor,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
if
this
court
decides
that
the
riverbed
is
not
owned
by
the
tribe,
then
the
tribe
submits
that
by
virtue
of
the
treaties
of
1868
that
it
has
the
exclusive
property
right
to
hunt
and
fish
within
the
boundaries
of
its
reservation
and
control
hunting
and
fishing
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
by
the
method
suggested
in
this
case,
and
that
is
by
excluding
all
non-indians
except
for
the
resident
owners
who
reside--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--i
think
the
negotiations
of
the
treaty
pointed
out
that
the
fishing,
your
honor,
and
the
hunting,
the
sustenance
that
can
be
derived
from
the
sources
within
the
reservation
was
very
important
to
the
tribe.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
i
think
it
does
from
the
standpoint
that
the
total
grant
made
to
the
tribe
included
the
river
for
that
purpose.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
that
is
our
second
argument
that
i
was
row
addressing,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
there
are...
the
issue
is
addressed--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--the
issue
is
addressed
in
the
alaska
fishery
case,
i
believe,
where
the
beds
of
the
rivers
around
the
island
were
given
to
the
tribe
and
that
the
tribe
was
allowed
the
right
to
exclude
the
public
from
fishery.
i
think
it's
also
addressed
in
the
lower
court
decision
in
this
case
in
finch,
and
also
in
the
lower
court
decision
in
the
pollmann
case
decided
by
judge
jameson.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
see
no
inconsistency
whatsoever.
i
think
the
commerce
clause
itself
requires
that
the
united
states
have
the
navigation
servitude.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
for
purposes
of
floating?
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
i
think
it
does,
but
i
would
like
to
add,
your
honor,
that
there
is...
this
is
not
an
artery
of
commerce.
this
river
is
floated
only
for
the
purposes--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--of
fishing.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
it
is.
it
is
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
i
do.
but
i
do
not--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--i
don't
see--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
i
think
we
felt
that
it
was
a
separate
theory
and
on--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--i
think
we
believed
it
was
a
right
that
went
along
with
ownership
of
the
riverbed
itself.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
the
property
right
in
the
hunting?
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
i
think
one
answer
to
the
question,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
is
that
the
ownership
issue
is
relevant
from
the
standpoint
that
if
the
bed
was
owned
by
the
tribe,
then
it
would
fall
into
a
trust
status,
and
i
think
it
would
fall
under,
then,
the
purview
of--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--1165.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
are
you
talking
about
an
area--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--it's
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
but
part
of
it,
taken
for
the
construction
of
yellowtail
dam,
above
the
dam
site,
but
there
is
no--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
it's
the
bottom
of
the
riverbed
that
flows
below
the
dam
and
the
afterbed.
it
is
our
feeling
that
we
do
have
an
exclusive
property
right
to
hunt
and
fish
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
excepting
the
one
exception
that
was
made
by
the
9th
circuit
as
to
fee-resident
owners.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
in
balancing
the
allotment
acts
with
the
original
intent
of
the
treaty,
that
the
rights
of
the
tribe
to
exclusive
use
of
its
reservation
have
been
abolished
to
the
point
where
they
cannot
exclude
non-indian
sport
fishermen
from
coming
within
the
reservation
and
using
the
resource.
there
is
no
express
indication
in
the
record
that
that
right
to
exclude
others,
non-indian
sportsmen,
from
the
reservation
hunting
and
fishing
has
been
done.
i
think,
once
again,
this
is
an
ongoing
governmental
body,
this
is
a
tribal
body
that's
operating
and
actively
practicing
its
culture.
seventy
percent
of
the
land
is
currently
in
trust.
under
section
14
of
the
allotment
act,
which
appears
at
the
petitioners'
appendix
at
105,
and
the
page
at
116,
there
is
a
provision
where
land
can
actually
pass
back
from
fee
status
into
trust
status,
and
the
tribe
is
actively
involved
in
trying
to
repurchase
some
of
the
land
that
has
gone
out
of
the
trust
status,
to
maintain
its
culture
and
to
maintain
its
majority
impact
within
the
boundaries
of
its
reservation.
if
this
court
were
not
to
grant
the
exclusive
right
to
control
hunting
and
fishing
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
then
i
think
the
reservation
would
become
diminished
without
express
congressional
enactments.
and
also,
it
would
greatly
reduce
and
almost
make
meaningless
the
attempt
by
the
tribe
to
regulate,
a
regulation
that
i
think
has
been
recognized
by
petitioners,
to
control
hunting
and
fishing
on
trust
lands,
to
control
non-indian
access
to
trust
lands
for
hunting
and
fishing,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
combination
of
fee
land
and
trust
land.
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
read
a
paragraph,
because
i
believe
it
is
important,
in
volume
ii
of
the
joint
appendix...
it's
tribal
exhibit
71qq,
it
appears
starting
at
page
86
of
that
volume.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
yes,
your
honor,
86.
and
it's
a
letter
from
the
superintendent
of
the
crow
agency
to
the
area
director,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
in
billings.
and
it's
a
letter
that
actually
attached
to
the
resolution
that's
in
question
here,
resolution
7405.
it's
stated
there,
on
page
87:
"hunting
pressure
on
the
reservation
has
increased
to
a
point
where
game
is
depleted
or
nonexistent
in
vast
areas.
"
"new
highways,
increases
in
population,
prosperity
and
inflated
food
prices
contribute
greatly
to
the
influx
of
sportsmen,
meat
hunters
and
poachers.
"
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
and
i
think
the
critical
paragraph
4(a):
"the
general
public
has
taken
advantage
of
interspersed
fee
and
indian
trust
lands
to
utilize
the
whole
reservation
without
respect
to
land
status
because
the
state
of
montana
takes
no
responsibility
for
the
policing
of
indian
lands,
the
crow
tribe
does
not
have
the
funds,
the
police
force,
nor
the
authority
to
protect
their
lands
and
the
department
of
the
interior
has
not
taken
effective
action
to
curtain
violations.
"
"enforcement
is
so
impractical
that
with
this
knowledge
the
general
public
utilizes
the
whole
reservation
as
a
haven
for
unlimited
hunting
and
fishing.
"
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
notwithstanding
that
sentence,
your
honor,
my
reading
of
the
alaska
fishermen's
case
is
that
the
government
intended
clearly
to
convey
title
to
the
waters
around
the
island
of
that
tribe
to
the
tribe.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
i
think
the
grant
was
made
prior--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--and
i
think
that
the
government
intended
to
make
the
grant.
and
i
believe
alaska
had
yet
to
attain--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--i
don't--
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
--i
just
believe
there's
other
language
in
the
decision
that
clearly
shows
the
intent.
mr.
thomas
j.
lynaugh
i
think
it's
foreshadowed
by
the
other
language
in
the
decision,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
paragraphs
i've
read
and
the
exhibit
that
appears
at
page
88-89
there's
also
a
paragraph
that
indicates,
at
the
bottom
of
page
89,
that
the
crow
tribe's
action
to
close
the
reservation
to
the
public
was
very
unpopular
with
the
general
public
and
caused
retaliations
in
the
form
of
some
economic
sanctions
being
taken
against
the
tribe,
not
being
able
to
get
credit
as
easily
as
they
might
have
been
able
to
in
the
past,
things
of
this
nature.
in
summary,
i
think
the
tribe
believes
that
some
balancing
of
the
treaty
rights
with
current
day
situations
exists,
and
that
the
9th
circuit
made
a
valiant
attempt
to
do
this
by
carving
out
an
exception
for
the
resident
fee
owners.
we
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
rationale
involved
with
that
exception,
because
the
resident
fee
owner
is
actually
contributing
to
the
reservation
economy
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
in
many
instances.
the
reservation
economy
is
an
agricultural
economy.
the
non-indian
is
usually
leasing
lands
from
indians
and
thus
contributing
to
the
support
of
indians
within
the
reservation.
also,
the
pressure
that
the
non-indian
would
put
on
the
hunting
and
fishing
within
the
reservation
is
slight
compared
to
the
pressure
that
would
be
placed
on
the
reservation
by
virtue
of
the
opening
of
the
river
to
non-indian
hunters
and
fishers
from
without
the
state
of
montana
and
a
great
deal
from
within.
therefore,
we
believe,
with
regard
to
the
power
to
hunt
and
fish
as
a
property
right
and
the
power
to
exclude
non-indians
who
are
not
residents,
that
power
has
not
been
abrogated
from
the
treaty.
