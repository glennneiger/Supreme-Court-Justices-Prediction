mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
begin,
if
i
may,
by
addressing
the
river
bed
issue,
as
it
has
been
called,
partly
because
the
focus
has
been
there
and
rightly
so.
it
may
indeed
be
the
only
live
issue
in
this
case,
depending
on
how
the
court
resolves
that
issue.
i
say
that--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--indeed.
and
as
your
honor
may
have
noted,
we
began
in
our
brief
by
wondering
why
the
bed
of
the
river
rather
than
the
fishing
of
the
river--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--was
the
issue
here?
the
answer
is
twofold:
first,
that
the
petitioners
rightly
or
wrongly
have
at
all
stages
of
this
case
conceded
that
if
the
tribe,
or
the
united
states
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe,
owns
the
bed,
they
then
enjoy,
the
tribe
enjoys
an
exclusive
fishery
within
the
river.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
the
premise
on
which
the
petitioners
have
argued
this
case
throughout.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me
there
was
a
somewhat
change
of
emphasis
under
perhaps
prompting
from
the
court,
but
the
briefs
in
all
courts
and
the
arguments
until
today
were
entirely
premised
on
that
concession.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
federal
statute
1165
has
been
construed
as
covering
not
merely
trespassing,
touching
the
bottom,
either
with
the
hook
or
with
the
feet,
but
also
of
fishing
the
overlying
waters
if
the
underlying
land
is
tribally
owned--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
has
been
the
understanding,
the
interpretation--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--of
section
1165.
that
was
the
premise
of
the
finch
prosecution
which
came
to
this
court,
which
was
vacated
on
wholly
independent
grounds.
but
no
one
questioned...
in
that
litigation,
nor
in
this
secondary
litigation...
the
notion
that
it
would
violate
that
federal
statute
to
fish
even
without
touching
the
bottom.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
they
can
do
so,
because
the
tribe
was--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--indeed,
mr.
justice
white,
but
just
as
the
state--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--only
because
of
the
paramount
federal
navigational
servitude
which,
arguably
at
least,
has
a
corollary
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large,
that
is
a
public
right
of
navigation
on
navigable
rivers
up
through
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
we
begin
with
the
shively
case
followed
in
any
number
of
cases,
the
most
recently
affirmed
in
this
court
in
the
choctaw
case,
that
there
is,
in
the
words
of
shively,
"undoubted
power
in
the
united
states
before
statehood
to
grant
away
or
to
reserve
to
itself
for
a
special
purpose
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers
which
would
otherwise
inure
to
the
future
state.
"
we
had
not
supposed
that
that
proposition
was
open
to
reexamination
in
this
case.
and
indeed,
my
brother
seemed
not
to
challenge
that
settled
proposition.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
power
of
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
it
must
be
done
for
a
public
purpose--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--and
clearly,
though,
it
is
perhaps
proper
to
say
that
the
extent
to
which
the
presumption
against
its
being
done
varies
according
as
the
beneficiary
is
an
individual
private
person
who
would
be
obtaining
a
special
privilege
by
a
piecemeal
grant
of
some
part
of
the
river
bottom,
as
opposed
to
a
political
society,
a
point
made
in
the
choctaw
opinion,
such
as
an
indian
tribe
granted
a
large
territory
from
which
the
white
public
was
specifically
intended
to
be
excluded.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
recognize
that
there
is
language
in
the
corvallis
case
which
may
cast
doubt
on
what
had
otherwise
been
thought
to
be
settled
law
but
the
corvallis
case
in
its
holding
does
not
in
any
way
question
the
power
before
statehood
of
the
united
states
to
grant
away
the
beds
of
navigable
rivers,
as
i
understand
the
case.
i
concede
that
there
is
language
which
could
be
read
as
pointing
in
that
direction.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
some
tension,
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
would
have
thought
there
was
some
tension
between
the
rule
that
the
public
land
in
the
west
belongs
to
the
united
states
while
in
the
east
it
does
not...
a
much
more...
tension,
yet,
a
proposition
not
yet
questioned
in
this
court.
at
all
events,
i
begin
with
the
assumption
that
the
court
is
not
reexamining
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
grant
away
at
least
in
circumstances
where
there
is
a
plain
public
purpose
to
be
served.
and
i
may
say
that
the
choctaw
case
is
not
standing
alone
in
so
ruling.
not
only
did
shively,
almost
a
hundred
years
ago,
seem
to
settle
that
proposition
quite
clearly,
but
the
alaska
fisheries
case
is
a
clear
statement
that
the
united
states
in
the
territorial
period
may
reserve
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
submerged
lands
and
tidelands
which
would
otherwise
be
held
in
trust
for
the
future
state,
and
the
state
of
alaska,
since
statehood,
has
not
challenged
the
effectiveness
of
the
annet
reservation
in
alaska,
which
was
recognized
in
that
case,
in
the
alaska
fisheries
case,
as
including
both
the
waters
and
the
beds.
now,
i
may
say
that
at
the
beginning,
there
may
have
been
a
question
whether
the
navigational
servitude
of
the
united
states,
while
remaining
as
a
power
in
the
federal
government
necessarily
had
its
full
corollary
of
allowing
strangers
to
come
into
the
heart
of
the
reservation
by
boat.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
it
may
be,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
in
the
case
of
an
entire
territory
which
is
sealed
off,
as
this
was
intended
to
be,
with
an
explicit
promise
by
the
united
states
to
let
no
one
enter
except
by
permission
of
the
tribe,
that
the
public
right
to
come
on
this
relatively
small
river,
which
may
not
have
been
so
clearly
viewed
as
navigable,
was
to
some
degree
diminished.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may
have
different
aspects,
as
we
know
from
the
kaiser
aetna
case.
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
withhold
a
permit
for
activities
within
navigable
waters
may
not
necessarily
grant
the
public
at
large
a
right
of
free
entry.
and
what
is
more--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
it
does
have
two
aspects.
one
is
the
power
in
the
united
states
to
use
for
public
purposes
the
flow
of
that
river,
and
the
other
is
the
corollary
power
or
right
of
the
public
to
enjoy
freely
without
toll...
for
commercial
purposes,
primarily.
here,
originally,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
anyone
to
enter
on
the
big
horn
river
entirely
encircled
by
crow
lands.
since
they
were
going
from
nowhere
to
nowhere
except
within
the
crow
reservation
from
which
they
were
excluded,
could
not
land,
and
in
our
submission
could
not
fish,
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
in
conceding
their
right
of
entry.
it
may
be
in
that
light
that
the
treaty
spoke
of
the
boundary
as
cutting
off
the
river.
today,
however,
we
would
concede
that
just
as
the
public
highways
that
traverse
the
reservation
are
open
to
the
public,
so
is
the
river
for
purposes
other
than
fishing.
and
i
stress
here
that
the
treaty,
if
it
did
not
reserve
the
bed
to
the
tribe,
may
nevertheless
have
reserved
the
fishery
or
it
may
have
reserved
the
water,
in
the
sense
that
the
public
were
not
invited
into
the
heart
of
this
reservation
for
the
purpose
of
sharing
the
wildlife
that
abounds
there.
and
while
there
were
no
trout
at
that
time,
there
were
presumably
waterfowl
and
other
game.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
accept
that
ruling.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
we
however--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--we
approach
it
much
as
the
9th
circuit
did,
that
there
is
a
tension
between
the
exclusive
reservation
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe
of
this
territory
and
what
can
be
viewed
as
congressional
invitation
to
nonmembers
to
enter
upon
and
purchase
lots
within
that
reservation.
those
two
federal
declarations
have
to
be
accommodated.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
not
concede
that
the
riparian
fee
owner
has
a
right
to
fish
in
the
river,
and
i
may
say
that
the
namen
case--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--no,
mr.
justice
white.
the
9th
circuit
said
that
they
could
hunt
and
fish
on
their
own
land
but--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--but
they
have
no
riparian
subsoil
ownership
or--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
there
are
fishing
places
within...
the
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
nonnavigable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
this
is
nonnavigable?
are
we
talking
about
the
big
horn
river
or?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
according
to
the
9th
circuit
the
ownership
of
the
bed
is
in
the
tribe
or
in
the
united
states
government
for
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
not
under
the
9th
circuit's
holding.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
their
own
land
if
they
have
a
fishing
pond
or
if
it's
a
nonnavigable
stream,
such
as
the
little
big
horn,
to
which
they
are
riparian,
and
where
they
would
own
to
the
middle...
of
the
river.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
the
9th
circuit
explicitly
said
the
opposite,
and
so
had
the...
in
the
namen
case
involving
the
flathead
reservation,
where
the
9th
circuit
upheld
the
tribe's
claim
to
the
bed
of
the
flathead
lake,
just
as
it
did
here,
and
while
it
conceded
the
riparian
right
of
the
fee
owners
to
wharfage
and
to
access
for
navigation
to
the
lake,
it
denied
them
the
right
to
fish
in
the
lake.
so
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
may
put
their
boats
in
the
river
but
they
may
not
fish
because
that
fishery
is
a
part
of
the
reserve
that
was
originally
set
apart
for
the
tribe.
it's
perhaps
important
to
stress
that
the
only
live
controversy
so
far
as
the
record
in
this
case
discloses,
and
indeed
so
far
as
any
other
information
available
to
me
reveals,
is
with
respect
to
hunting
and
fishing
on
the
big
horn
river.
there
could
be
issues
about
a
fee
owner
away
from
the
river
using
his
land
to
invite
hunting
or
fishing
parties,
fishing
in
this
case
of
nonnavigable
ponds
or
streams.
that
so
far
as
we're
aware
has
not
become
a
problem.
what
is
more,
the
tribe
concedes,
though
perhaps
it
need
not,
that
it
will
not
press
its
claim
so
as
to
ignore
fencing
or
posting.
so
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
fee
owners
having
been
conceded
by
the
court
of
appeals
a
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
their
own
lands,
the
tribe
having
not
pressed
their
claim
to
do
likewise
on
those
parcels,
the
only
areas
which
are
seriously
contested
are
the
big
horn
fishery,
both
in
terms
of...
and
hunting
of
wildfowl
there.
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
riparian
owner
owns
any
part
of
the
bed.
the
only
claim
made
is
in
the
name
of
the
state,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
state
by
either
owning
the
bed
or
by
purchasing
two
strategically
located
lots
on
the
edge
of
the
river
can
effectively
defeat
what
had
been
the
exclusive
right
of
the
tribe
to
use
that
resource
by
inviting
the
world
in.
and
we're
not
talking
about
white
owners
who
live
on
the
reservation,
or
even
if--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
would
certainly
present
a
much
more
attractive
case
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
plaintiffs,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
true
claimants
here
are
total
outsiders
who
neither
own
nor
live
on
the
reservation,
who
live
in
billings
or
in
hardin
and
who
come
by
the
thousands
and
fish
and
hunt
on
the
big
horn
river,
and
thereby
effectively
destroy
what
had
been
and
what
was
thought
to
have
remained
to
be
the
special
hunting
and
fishing
preserve
of
the
tribe.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
state
of
montana
has
not
mentioned
these
outsiders
in
any
of
it's
briefs.
it
keeps
speaking
of
the
allottee
or
the
person
who
bought
from
an
allottee--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--but
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
non-owners...
they
speak
about
absentee
land-owners,
but
they
never
speak
about
total
outsiders,
total
strangers--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--they
never
speak
about
state
lands,
except
for
the
bed
of
the
river.
and
that
is
the
real
bone
of
contention,
whether
the
would
outside
through
the
device
of
the
state
having
purchased
two
allotments
on
the
river,
can
thereby
inundate
with
thousands
of
fishermen
and
hunters
and
crowd
out
the
tribe
whose
resource
this
is
guaranteed
to
be
by
solemn
treaty.
one
last
word
about
the
equal
footing
doctrine
in
the
bed
of
the
river.
we
have
perhaps
over-elaborately
attempted
to
explain
why
the
holt
case
is
not
an
obstacle
in
this
case
because
that
case
very
plainly
involved
a
situation
in
which
there
had
been
no
recognized
title
in
the
band
before
statehood,
and
the
court
simply
held
that
unextinguished
but
unconfirmed
indian
title
was
not
sufficient
to
defeat
what
was
otherwise
the
constitutional
claim
of
the
state
to
receive
the
benefit
of
navigable
waterbeds.
every
other
case
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
and
representing
a
very
substantial
body
of
property,
has
left
the
understanding
that
when
the
description
plainly
encompasses
navigable
waterbeds,
those
are
included
in
the
confirmation
of
the
grant
to
an
indian
tribe.
the
alaska
fisheries
case
was
perhaps
the
first
to
state
that
clearly,
but
that
was
as
long
ago
as
1918.
it
was
restated
most
recently
in
the
choctaw
case.
it
has
been
followed
by
a
host
of
lower
courts,
and
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
that
if
this
court
were
once
again
to
endorse
that
proposition,
the
states,
montana
and
its
neighbors,
would
lose
what
they
thought
they
had.
the
understanding
in
law
has
been
for
now
70
years
that
in
circumstances
such
as
these,
and
these
are
particularly
clear
ones
because
of
the
description.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
the
very
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
says,
we
cannot
doubt
that
congress
has
the
power
to
make
grants
of
land
below
high
water
mark
of
navigable
waters
in
any
territory
of
the
united
states
whenever
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so
in
order
to
perform
its
national
obligations,
or
to
effect
the
improvement
of
such
lands
for
the
promotion
and
convenience
of
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states,
or
to
carry
out
other
public
purposes
appropriate
to
the
objects
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory.
this
court
in
alaska
fisheries
expressly
held
that
the
creation
of
an
indian
reservation
was
an
appropriate
object
for
which
the
united
states
held
the
territory.
so
that
the
shively
case,
while
saying
now,
normally,
the
united
states
holds
the
title--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes,
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
it
is
only
a
presumption
and
it
can
be
overridden,
at
least
provided
a
public
purpose
is
involved;
and
certainly
confirming
the
diminished
territory
of
the
crow
tribe
was
such
a
purpose.
my
time
is
up.
