we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
montana
et
al.
v.
united
states.
mr.
roth,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
nonmembers
of
what?
chief
justice
burger
what
is
the
value
of
a
treaty
or
any
engagement
if
we're
going
to
probe
into
the
understanding?
chief
justice
burger
what
is
the
value
of
a
treaty
or
a
contract
if
we're
going
to
undertake
to
probe
into
whether
the
parties
understood
the
contents?
chief
justice
burger
special
rule
as
to
indian
treaties?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
you
seem
to
link,
you
seem
to
say
that
they
can
grant
the
right
to
float
on
the
water.
chief
justice
burger
but
you
link
that
with
the
ground
below.
now,
you
might
grant,
logically,
the
right
to
float
on
the
stream,
but
retain
title
to
the
land
in
case
there
is
oil
or
gold
or
something
else
under
it.
nothing
inconsistent
about
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
burger
i
thought
you...
i
got
the
impression
that
you
were
saying
just
that,
that
they
could
not
separate
these
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
roth.
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lynaugh.
chief
justice
burger
then
why
so
much
emphasis
on
the
ownership
argument?
ownership
of
the
bed?
well,
it
certainly
makes
an
awful
lot
of
difference,
how
you
fish
a
stream,
who
owns
the
bed.
if
somebody
who
owns
the
bed
doesn't
want
you
to
fish--
chief
justice
burger
--it's
the
converse--
chief
justice
burger
--the
converse
of
that
i'm
driving
at.
obviously,
you
have
one
situation
if
you
own
the
bed,
but
do
you
need
to
assert
ownership
of
the
bed
to
assert
control
of
the
fishing?
chief
justice
burger
86,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
lynaugh.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
roth?
chief
justice
burger
no,
but
to
my
knowledge,
if
the
game
is
being
taken
for
food,
that's
as
distinguished
from
sport.
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
montana
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
stewart.
