justice
stevens
--as
trustee
for
the
state
to
be
formed?
that's
what
it
was?
all
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
roth,
again,
just
to
finish
up
this
thought,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
your
position.
it's
your
view
that
this
trustee
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
future
state
to
be
formed
was
of
constitutional
origin
and
it
was
formed
before
1868.
does
that
mean
that
if
the
treaty
of
1868
had
in
explicit
language
said,
we
hereby
convey
to
you
the
bed
of
the
river,
something
like
that,
that
that
would
have
been
beyond
the
power
of
the
united
states?
