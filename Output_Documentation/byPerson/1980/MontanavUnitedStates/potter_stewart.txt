justice
stewart
is
the
dam
inside
the
reservation?
justice
stewart
now,
you
say,
montana
owns
it,
which
they
use?
justice
stewart
who
uses
it,
the
people
of
montana?
justice
stewart
montana
owns
it
in
fee?
justice
stewart
and
who
uses
it?
justice
stewart
by
license,
by
permission,
or
is
it
just
open?
justice
stewart
but
not
any
particular
permission
to
go
on
the
property,
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
and
that's
been
true
up
until
this
litigation,
anyway?
justice
stewart
why?
because
he's
a
nonresident,
is
that
it,
of
the
reservation?
justice
stewart
of
course,
the
very
existence
of
a
treaty
implied
the
sovereignty
of
the
indian
nation,
didn't
it?
you
don't
make
a
treaty
with
somebody
who's
not
a
sovereign.
justice
stewart
between
us
and
england,
say?
justice
stewart
but
you
don't
make
a
treaty
with
somebody
who
doesn't
have
some
sovereign
qualities?
justice
stewart
in
other
words...
otherwise,
you
just
pass
a
law.
justice
stewart
that's
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
any
riparian
owner
has
those
rights?
justice
stewart
you
say,
mr.
claiborne.
it's
been
a
little
confusing
to
me,
perhaps
i
don't,
perhaps,
fully
understand
this
case...
why
the
ownership
of
the
river
bed
is
crucial
or
critical
in
a
right
to
regulate
fishing
case?
generally,
the
ownership
of
the
bed
of
a
river
becomes
important
in
a
case
where
somebody
wants
to
take
sand
or
gravel
out
of
the
bed,
or
something
more
valuable
like
oil
or
minerals,
precious
or
otherwise.
but
up
until
now,
i
don't
think
that's
been
the
critical
fact
insofar
as
regulation
of
fishing
or
hunting.
has
it?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
fish
aren't
in
the
bed
of
the
river,
they're
in
the
river.
justice
stewart
that
is,
the
power
of
the
united
states?
justice
stewart
within
at
least
some
limitations,
at
least,
according
to
shively?
justice
stewart
ordinarily.
justice
stewart
you
would
agree
with
mr.
roth
that
there
is
some
tension
between
this
aspect
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
cases
such
as
choctaw?
justice
stewart
isn't
that
generally
what
follows
from
the
navigational
servitude,
a
public
right
of
access
to
navigable
streams
to
traverse
a
stream?
justice
stewart
or
maybe
the
navigational
servitude
was
eliminated
too,
extinguished.
and
if
what
you
say...
navigational
servitude
either
exists
on
it
doesn't,
and
i
haven't
heard
about
a
claim
that
it
exists
partially.
justice
stewart
well,
generally,
that
is
what
the
federal
navigational
servitude
implies,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
although
it
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
basic
theory,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
you
accept
it
because
you--
justice
stewart
and
that
is
the
presumption
in
the
absence
of
a
conveyance?
justice
stewart
isn't
that
it?
justice
stewart
so
there
wouldn't
be
any
fishery
at
all
in
the
absence
of
stocking?
justice
stewart
we're
talking
about
a
trout
fishery,
aren't
we?
justice
stewart
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
at
all
in
the
absence
of
stocking,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stewart
because
there's
no
propagation?
justice
stewart
does
that
mean
the
right
of
the
general
public
to
navigate
the
river?
justice
stewart
for
any
purpose.
to
traverse
the
river.
justice
stewart
it's
a
navigable
stream.
justice
stewart
it's
a
navigable
stream?
justice
stewart
and
you
concede
the
federal
government
has
a
navigational
servitude?
justice
stewart
and
generally
a
navigational
servitude
implies
a
right
of
the
general
public
to
traverse
the
navigable
stream,
does
it
not?
justice
stewart
and
do
you
concede
that
exists
here?
justice
stewart
and...
but
with
no
right
to...
the
right
to
traverse,
but
no
right
to
fish
in
the
water,
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
except
by
permission
of
the
tribe?
justice
stewart
and
why,
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
why...
and
this
is
maybe
the
same
question
that
my
brother
white
asked
you,
but
perhaps
a
little
broader,
why
does
ownership...
why
isn't
ownership
of
something
quite
different
from
the
power
to
exercise
regulation
or
control
over
it?
in
other
words,
government
has
the
conceded
power
to
regulate
the
speed
of
vehicular
traffic
but
it
doesn't
assert
that
it
owns
those
automobiles.
justice
stewart
they
are
separate,
aren't
they?
they're
separate
concepts,
and
one
makes
sense
without
the
other.
justice
stewart
but
it
may
exist
even
without
ownership,
may
it
not?
justice
stewart
no,
the
power
to
regulate?
justice
stewart
without
any
ownership
whatsoever?
justice
stewart
--even
though
the
grant
were
made
earlier,
the
language
from
the
alaska
fisheries
opinions
read
to
you
by
my
brother
rehnquist
would
indicate
that
the
grant
was
a
temporary
grant
or
a
conditional
grant,
wouldn't
it?
subject
to
a
condition
subsequent?
justice
stewart
wouldn't
that
language
so
indicate?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
no.
