mr.
urban
l.
roth
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
crow
indian
reservation
created
by
the
treaty
of
1868
is
an
area
of
approximately
2.2
million
acres
located
in
the
state
of
montana.
about
400,000
acres
of
that
land
is
in
tribal
hands
and
is
located
in
the
pryor
mountains
of
the
big
horn
mountains,
and
there
are
no
issues
involved
in
this
case
affecting
that
particular
land.
approximately
30
percent
of
the
reservation
lands
are
owned
by
non-indians,
approximately
43
percent
of
the
population
of
the
reservation
is
non-indian.
the
big
horn
river
is
a
navigable
river
that
rises
in
the
state
of
wyoming
and
flows
for
many
miles
before
it
reaches
the
state
of
montana.
it
is
a
navigable
stream
and
within
the
heart
of
the
reservation
flows
for
approximately
45
to
50
miles.
in
the
big
horn
mountains
area,
the
yellowtail
dam,
a
federally
funded
project,
has
been
built,
which
backs
up
a
reservoir
of
approximately
70
miles,
which
extends
into
the
state
of
wyoming.
the
building
of
that
dam
created
an
excellent
cold
water
fishery.
however--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
the
cold
water
fishery
that
was
created
by
the
dam
is
a
put-and-take
stream.
that
is,
the
river
itself
does
not
lend
itself
to
spawning.
as
a
result,
the
state
of
montana
has
been,
since
the
dam
was
built,
the
only
contributor
up
to
the
time
of
trial
of
the
fish
which
proliferate
in
that
particular
stream.
brown
and
rainbow
trout
are
the
main
species.
they
are
exotic
to
the
reservation,
are
not
indigenous,
and
were
introduced
into
the
reservation
by
the
state
of
montana.
the
tribe
owns
only
one
40-acre
tract
which
is
riparian
to
the
river.
all
other
riparian
land
has
either
been
allotted
or
is
owned
by
non-fee
owners.
montana
owns
a
number
of
parcels
riparian
to
the
river
which
they
use
for
fishing
and
boating
access.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
the
state
of
montana
in
a
sort
of
a
parens
patriae
position
owns
the--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
fishermen,
various
non-indians
or
indians,
whoever
wants
to
use
that
particular
piece
of
property
to
gain
access
to
the
big
horn
river
or
fish
the
waters
of
the
big
horn
river.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
well,
with
regard
to
nonmembers,
of
course
the
state
of
montana
has
consistently
required
a
state
hunting
or
fishing
license.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
nonmembers
of
the
crow
indian
tribe.
excuse
me.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
no.
there
isn't
any
permission
required
by
the
state
of
montana
to
go
on
the
pond.
it's
open
to
the
public.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
that's
correct.
in
this
lawsuit
brought
by
the
united
states
and
joined
in
by
the
crow
tribe
of
indians,
the
united
states
claims
that
the
big
horn
river,
this
navigable
river,
is
owned
by
them
in
fee
for
the
beneficial
ownership
of
the
crow
indian
tribe.
they
also
claim
in
this
court
that
save
and
except
for
the
exception
carved
out
for
the
nonmember
of
the
crow
tribe,
owner
of
fee
lands,
hunting
and
fishing
exception,
which
is
carved
out
by
the
lower
court,
that
the
crow
tribe
has
the
exclusive
right
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
within
the
reservation,
including
that
engaged
in
by
nonmembers
on
fee-owned
land
within
the
reservation.
the
state
of
montana
in
its
amici
states...
refutes
these
contentions.
trial
of
this
case
was
before
the
hon.
james
f.
battin,
district
judge
for
the
district
of
montana.
in
that
trial
judge
battin
heard
the
testimony
of
15
witnesses,
examined
288
exhibits,
studied
the
pretrial
discovery,
and
thereafter
rejected
the
claims
of
the
respondents.
in
making
his
conclusion
he
relied
upon
many
of
the
facts
that
were
developed
through
testimonial
evidence
and
through
the
exhibits
themselves.
many
of
these
factual
findings,
we
believe,
are
critical
to
resolution
of
the
issues
before
this
court
today.
upon
appeal
to
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
reversed
in
part
and
affirmed
in
part.
they
carved
out
a
peculiar
exception
for
the
non-indian
fishing
and
hunting
on
his
fee
lands.
they
held
that
that
was
authorized
but
still
the
tribe
could
regulate
that
activity
so
long
as
that
regulation
was
nondiscriminatory.
however,
with
regard
to
the
non-indian
neighbors
such
as
mr.
lackland,
who
testified
at
trial,
who
owns
1,040
acres
within
the
confines
of
the
reservation
in
fee
and
who
lives
approximately
30
miles
off
the
reservation,
and
who
built
a
pond
and
stocked
it
with
fish...
oddly,
that
particular
individual
cannot
under
the
lower
court's
ruling
go
onto
that
land
and
fish
that
stock.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
because
he's
a
nonresident
and
a
nonmember
of
the
tribe.
but
what's
the
irony
of
that
situation
is
this,
that
that
nonmember,
as
conceded
by
the
respondents,
can
post
his
land.
and
although
the
exclusive
hunting
and
fishing
right
is
claimed
by
the
tribe,
nevertheless
he
can
exclude
the
member
from
hunting
and
fishing
on
his
land.
the
state
of
montana
petitioned
this
court,
and
it
was
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
conclusions
of
the
lower
court.
additionally,
i
would
like
to
comment
upon
the
fact
that
although
there
was
no
comment
about
the
facts
found
by
district
judge
battin,
nevertheless,
apparently
on
those
same
factual
findings
the
lower
court
reached
a
conflicting
conclusion.
basically,
there
are
two
sets
of
issues
in
this
case,
which
we
will
separate
into
what
we
call
the
ownership
or
river
issues,
and
the
regulatory
issues.
however,
both
sets
of
issues
require
that
a
study
of
the
treaty
history
and
the
legislative
history
entered
into
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
be
undertaken.
the
first
treaty
with
the
crow
and
the
united
states
occurred
in
1825.
basically,
it
was
a
treaty
of
friendship.
it
established
the
paramount
authority
of
the
united
states,
and
that
authority
was
extended
to
resolve
disputes
that
might
occur
between
the
indians
and
the
non-indians.
this
treaty
was
followed
by
the
treaty
of
1851.
as
the
lower
court
observed,
there
was
no
express
grant
of
land
contained
in
the
1851
treaty,
although
a
particular
territory
was
allocated
to
the
crow
indian
tribe.
the
only
reference
to
hunting
and
fishing
in
that
particular
treaty
was
a
reference
that
all
of
the
tribes
retained
their
privilege
to
hunt
and
fish
on
basically,
i
suppose,
their
traditional
hunting
and
fishing
grounds.
this
was
followed
by
the
treaty
of
1868.
again,
in
article
i
of
that
treaty,
the
united
states
was
a
sovereignty;
paramount
sovereignty
was
again
recognized,
and
it
was
the
only
sovereign
in
that
treaty
who
could
sanction
non-indian
intruders
or
malfeasors,
if
you
will.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
or
sovereignty
which
was
given
or
granted
to
the
tribes
by
that
treaty.
and
i
think
that's
very,
very--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--well,
that's
correct.
the
united
states,
however,
was...
many
times,
of
course,
treaties
are
entered
into
with
equal
sovereignty,
such
as
to--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--between
us
and
england.
in
this
case
the
paramount
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
was
conceded
by
the
tribe.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
that's
correct.
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
though,
although
the
quasi-sovereignty
of
the
indian
tribes
was
recognized
at
that
time,
there
was
no
question
that
the
united
states
could
pass
a
law
if
they
wanted
to,
and
do
whatever
they
wished
with
regard
to
the
indians.
nevertheless,
out
of
deference
to
their
particular
status,
i'm
sure
that
they
did
treat
with
them.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice.
i
omitted
to
say
that
in
the...
well,
i
haven't
got
to
the
granting,
or
the
reservation
clause
of
the
treaty
of
1868.
in
regard
to
that
article
2,
there
was
reserved
approximately
an
area
of
8
million
acres
for
the
absolute
and
undisturbed
occupation
of
the
crow
indian
tribes.
in
addition,
no
one
was
permitted
to
reside
or
go
upon
the
reservation
without
consent.
by
article
4
of
that
treaty
the
crow
tribe
of
indians
agreed
to
make
it
their
permanent
home.
however,
they
were
given
the
privilege...
and
i
put
quotes
around
the
word
privilege
because
that
word
had
its
counterpart
within
the
crow
tribe.
in
other
words,
they
had
a
fairly
sophisticated
vocabulary.
they
knew
what
privilege
as
opposed
to
right
meant,
and
that
was
a
privilege
to
hunt
and
fish
on
the
unoccupied
lands
of
the
united
states
so
long
as
peace
persisted
between
the
united
states
and
the
crow
tribe.
superimposed
upon
those
treaties
is
a
legislative
history
which
includes
the
allotment
policy,
or
the
assimilation
policy,
commencing
with
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes,
sir.
the
allotment
policy
was
applied
to
the
crow
indian
reservation
by
the
allotment
act
of
1920.
against
this
treaty
and
legislative
backdrop
is
the
equal
footing
doctrine
upon
which
the
state
of
montana
makes
its
claims
to
the
ownership
of
the
bed
and
banks
of
the
big
horn
river.
it's
important
to
note
that
that
doctrine
was
enunciated
26
years
prior
to...
or
at
least
the
foundations
of
that
doctrine
were
enunciated
some
26
years
prior
to
the
treaty
of
1868
in
the
case
of
martin
v.
waddell,
which
was
decided
in
1842.
it
was
followed
shortly
thereafter
by
the
case
of
pollard's
lessee
v.
hagan,
in
1845.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
fasten
upon
why
the
equal
footing
doctrine
apparently
came
into
existence.
in
martin
v.
waddell,
in
studying
the
underpinnings
of
that
particular
doctrine,
this
court
apparently
seized
upon
the
fact
that
by
the
revolutionary
war
the
13
original
colonies
gained
their
independence,
and
thus
their
sovereignty,
from
the
king
of
england.
by
virtue
of
that
sovereignty
they
then
became
substitute
for
the
king
of
england
to
own
all
of
the
navigable
waters
which
were
in
or
touched
upon
those
13
original
colonies.
in
pollard's
lessee
v.
hagan
this
doctrine
was
then
expanded
to
those
states
who
were
not
within
the
13
original
colonies.
and
in
that
first
case,
really
articulating
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
they
said
that
title,
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
was
not
vested
in
the
united
states,
it
was
vested
in
the
tribe,
and
by
virtue
of
the
constitution,
then,
in
territorial
days
the
fee
title
to
those
navigable
waters
was
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
future
states
that
would
be
carved
out
of
those
territories.
that's
significant
because
in
1868,
with
regard
to
the
territory
of
montana,
that
territory
had
already
been
established.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
number
of
territory
acts
had
conceded
it...
nebraska,
dakota,
washington,
idaho,
and
subsequently,
of
course,
montana.
by
1868
territorial
capital
had
been
created.
by
1868
counties
which
included
the
territorial
limits
of
the
crow
reservation
had
been
created.
and
i
think,
at
this
point,
that
it
is
significant
to
refer
the
court
to
section
2,
because
it
becomes
important
as
we
talk
about
the
relevancy
of
choctaw
nation
v.
oklahoma.
section
2
of
the
organic
act,
or
section
1
of
the
organic
act
establishing
the
territory
of
montana--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--it
appears
at
pages
30-31
in
vol.
ii
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
it
states,
"that
nothing
in
this
act
contained
shall
be
construed
to
impair
the
rights
of
persons
or
property
now
pertaining
to
the
indians
in
said
territory
so
long
as
such
rights
remain
unextinguished
by
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
such
indians,
or
to
include
any
territory.
"
--now,
here
is
the
important
part:
"which,
by
treaty
with
any
indian
tribes,
is
not,
without
the
consent
of
said
tribe,
to
be
included
within
the
territorial
limits
or
jurisdiction
of
any
state
or
territory.
"
now,
what's
significant
about
that?
that
is
significant
because
in
the
treaty
of
1868
the
drafters
of
that
treaty
did
not
provide,
as
they
did
in
the
treaties
of
new
echota
with
the
choctaw,
and
the
later
treaty
of
1835
with
the
cherokee,
a
provision
guaranteeing
that
the
land
or
territory
would
never
be
contained
in
any
subsequent
state
or
territory.
thus,
i
think
that
language
in
the
territorial
act
is
significant
because
they
never
intended
that
those
later
created
indian
reservations
would
not
be
contained
within
a
subsequent
state
or
territory.
in
1868--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
no,
i
don't
think
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
well,
i
believe
so.
i
also
don't
believe
that
they
understood
what
the
ownership
of
the
bed
and
banks
of
the
navigable
river
actually
entailed,
nor
did
they
possess
the
sovereignty
that
i
think
is
necessary
for
the
regulation,
control,
and
ownership
of
a
segment
of
a
large,
navigable
stream,
was
within
their
understanding.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
urban
l.
roth
well,
at
times
this
court
appears
to
have
indicated
that
it
is
relevant
as
to
what
the
understanding
of
the
parties
was
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
that's
correct.
and
particularly
the
circumstances
surrounding
those
treaties.
however,
that
cuts
both
ways,
i
think.
as
this
court
observed,
i
believe,
in
rosebud
v.
kneip,
the
surrounding
circumstances,
i.e.,
the
legislation,
the
case
law
that
existed
at
that
particular
time,
was
also
important
in
ascertaining
what
the
intent
of
the
united
states
was
with
regard
to
the
particular
territory.
in
rosebud
v.
kneip
and
decoteau,
this
court
assumed
that
congress
was
cognizant,
for
example,
of
lonewolf
v.
hitchcock,
which
provided
the
basis
for
abrogation
of
indian
treaties;
and
that
they
were
cognizant
of
certain
other
factors.
i
think,
in
regards
to
the
treaty
of
1868,
we
must
assume
that
congress
was
cognizant
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
and
the
strong
constitutional
presumption
against
separating
the
ownership
of
a
navigable
river
from
a
sovereign
state.
in
1868,
also,
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
crow
were
a
buffalo-centered
culture.
they
were
not
dependent
upon
fish,
again,
a
factor
that
this
court
and
the
lower
court
has
deemed
significant
in
ascertaining
whether
or
not
navigable
waters
were
contained
within
confines
of
a
reservation.
i
cite
to
you
alaska
pacific
fisheries
v.
alaska,
and
the
lower
court
cases
of
skokomish
tribe
v.
france,
united
states
v.
moore,
and
united
states
v.
stotts.
in
skokomish,
of
course,
because
of
the
absence
of
an
interest
or
dependence
upon
fish,
the
lower
court
held
that
it
would
not
imply
that
navigable
waters
were
contained
within
the
confines
of
the
reservation.
also,
it's
important
that
the
lower
court,
in
its
factual
findings,
found
that
the
crow
tribe
was
not
dependent
upon
the
big
horn
river
for
travel.
also,
that...
it's
important,
i
think,
that
most
of,
if
not
all
of
the
tribal
interests
in
the
river
are
preserved
without
actual
proprietorship
being
conveyed.
for
example,
the
winters
doctrine
reserves
to
them
water.
the
u.s.
v.
powers
reserves
to
them
irrigation
rights.

tribes
v.
namen
guarantees
them
access
and
use
of
the
water.
and
of
course,
the
fact
that
they
are
riparian
to
the
river
guarantees
that
they
will
have
access
to
the
fishing
or
whatever
waterfowl
or
upland
game
birds
are
found
along
its
shores
or
on
its
waters.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
that's
correct;
that's
correct.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
won't
concede
that
point.
i
will
concede
that
they
will
claim
it.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
would
concede
that
they
will
assert
that
right,
your
honor.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
read
the
holding
below
as
conveying
to
them
ownership
of
the
entire
stream.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
presumably
regulatory
power.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
absolutely
not.
they've
conceded
the
navigational
servitude.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
well,
other
than
the
statement
in
shively
v.
bowlby
that
the
navigational
servitude
includes
the
right
to
travel,
the
right
of
commerce,
and
also
the
right
of
public
fishing.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
actually,
with
regard
to
that
argument--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes.
basically,
they've
conceded
that
the
river
ownership
isn't
exclusive.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
they
can
float
the
river
but
they
can't
cast
their
line
into
the
water
and
catch
a
fish
planted
by
the
state
of
montana,
is
basically
a
part
of
that
issue.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
not
floaters
on
the
river,
no.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
because--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--no,
i
didn't.
i
said
they
could...
perhaps
i
misperceived
your
question.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
no,
i
don't
think
the
holding
below
went
that
far.
i
don't
think
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
navigational
servitude
survives.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
think
that
the
lower
court
actually
didn't
deal
with
the
navigational
servitude.
obviously,
i
think,
because
of
the
concession
by
the
respondents
that
a
navigational
servitude--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--no,
i
don't
think
the
lower
court
went
that
far.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
precisely.
the
united
states...
or
the
respondents
have
conceded
that
confederated
salish
and
kootenai
tribes
v.
namen
controlled
access,
waterfree,
to
navigational
rights
on
the
big
horn
river.
and
that
poses,
basically,
a
paradoxical
question.
why
would
the
united
states
in
pursuing
some
public
exigency
or
public
purpose
grant
to
the
crow
tribe
the
bottom
or
bed
of
the
river
and
then
superimpose
upon
that
a
navigational
servitude
which
would
not
permit
them
to
control
navigation?
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
it
did
include
the
big
horn
river.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
don't
know
why
the
respondents...
but
they
have...
conceded
that
issue
to
us.
and
they
have
in
answers
to
interrogatories.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
by
"they",
your
honor,
is
the
tribe?
or
the
state
of
montana?
mr.
urban
l.
roth
no,
you
could
do
that,
but
i
think
you'd
have
to
do
it
with
definite
language.
you
certainly
wouldn't
imply
that.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
well,
i
think
they
would
not
separate
the
two
because,
in
the
first
instance,
there
isn't
any
treaty
language
that
would
even
approach
that
kind
of
an
intent.
and
to
do
that,
i
believe,
basically
would
be
inconsistent
because
there
was
certainly
nothing
in
1868
which
would
make
the
bottom
or
bed
of
the
stream
particularly
valuable
to
the
tribe
nor
that
they
placed
any
particular
value
upon
the
bed
of
the
stream.
thus,
to
separate--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--that's
correct.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
your
honor,
that
is
our
argument.
where
is
the
authority?
i
reiterate
that
in
answers
to
interrogatories
the
respondents
have
conceded
that
confederated
salish
and
kootenai
tribes
v.
namen,
which
i
referred
to
as
namen
i
because
namen
ii
is
on
its
course
up
through
the
appellate
court,
an
early
decision
by
the
honorable
william
j.
jameson,
which
held
that
on
the
flathead
lake
in
montana,
within
the
flathead
indian
reservation,
riparian
owners
did
have,
pursuant
to
the
navigational
servitude,
the
right
of
access
and
wharfage
without
tribal
permission
to
the
navigable
waters
of
flathead
lake.
in
response
to
interrogatories
in
this
case,
the
respondents
have
conceded
that
that
case
is
authoritative
in
this
case
and
that,
indeed,
all
riparian
owners
have
those
rights,
which
the
honorable
william
j.
jameson
articulated
in
namen
i.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
don't
think
one
can,
because
i
do
believe
it
creates
a
paradox.
and
i
think
the
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
petition
by
the
state
of
washington
focuses
upon
that
particular
dilemma.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
it's
in
the
9th
circuit,
however
not--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--well,
first
of
all,
namen
i
upon
which
i
rely
has
already
been
to
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
by
the
flathead
tribe
and
certiorari
was
denied.
the
9th
circuit
affirmed
namen
i's
decision
on
those
rights.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
that
case
is
settled
and
the
tribe--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--that's
right.
and
the
tribe
in
namen
ii
which
is
on
its
way
up,
have
not
challenged
namen
i's
decision
on
that
point.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
apparently.
i
would
also
like
to
rapidly
focus
upon
certain
other
factors
which
i
believe
bear
upon
the
ownership
issue,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
rather
boilerplate
language
was
used
in
the
treaty.
it
wasn't
the
unique
treaty
language
studied
by
the
court
in
choctaw
nation
v.
oklahoma.
it
affects
a
host
of
other
treaties.
it
affects
all
of
the
navigable
waters,
basically,
of
the
western
states,
at
least
with
regard
to
a
cohesive
and
coherent
regulatory
policy.
it's
important
that
prior
to
1973
montana
was
the
only
jurisdiction
to
plant
fish
in
the
big
horn
river.
it's
important
to
note
that
montana
was
the
only
jurisdiction
that
controlled
hunting
and
fishing
by
nonmembers
on
the
big
horn
or
fee
lands
prior
to
1973.
it's
important
to
note
that
nonmembers
have
fished
and
hunted
the
big
horn
without
hindrance
since
the
turn
of
the
century,
and
the
public
agencies
in
promoting
yellowtail
dam
listed
as
one
of
the
side
benefits
the
creation
of
a
good
cold
water
fishery
below
yellowtail
dam.
we
submit
that
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
as
applied
to
an
indian
reservation,
in
the
united
states
v.
holt
state
bank,
and
certainly
not
departed
from
in
choctaw
nation
v.
oklahoma,
but
under
the
peculiar
facts
of
that
case
warrant
a
departure
from
that,
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
applied
in
this
case
guarantees
the
state
of
montana
ownership
of
the
bed
and
banks
of
the
big
horn
river
within
the
crow
indian
reservation.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
regulatory
issues
because
that
is
another
portion
of
this
case,
and
it's
important
that
that
in
the
treaties
there
was
no
exclusive
hunting
and
fishing
rights
given
to
the
tribe.
the
argument
apparently
of
the
respondents...
that
their
right
to
regulate
nonmember
hunting
and
fishing
within
the
reservation
has
two
sources:
one,
proprietorship--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--as
trustee
for
the
state.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
and
perhaps,
in
further
answer
to
that
question,
there
was
in
effect
that
obligation
on
the
united
states
to
hold
that
fee
title
for
the
state
was
constitutional
in
origin,
as
i
believe
this
court
stated
in
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
company
v.
oregon.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
well,
it
contributes,
at
the
confluence
of
the
yellowstone
and
the
big
horn
river,
almost
three
million
acre
feet
per
year
to
the
yellowstone
river.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
don't
know
what
the
cubic
foot/second
flow
is.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
sometimes
you
wade,
but
basically
it
lends
itself
to
floating,
because
there
is
a
large
quantity
of
water
which
is
released
at
minimum
flow
levels
from
the
yellowtail
dam.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
that's
one
of
the...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you've
hit
upon
one
of
the
features
that
make
it
such
an
excellent
fishery,
because
it
comes
out--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes.
forty-five
degrees
to
50
degrees.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
that's
correct.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
no
question
about
it.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
that's
correct.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
don't
think
one
can
ignore
this
court's
language
in
shively
v.
bowlby
and
in
choctaw
nation
v.
oklahoma,
despite
the
very,
very
strong
language
that
this
court
later
used
in
corvallis
sand
&
gravel
company
v.
united
states.
however,
very,
very
stringent
limitations
were
placed
upon
a
departure
from
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
and
yes,
i
would
concede
that
in
light
of
the
choctaw
case
and
in
light
of
shively
v.
bowlby,
they
would
have
that
power,
if
they
did
it
explicitly,
and
for
a
sufficiently
strong
public
purpose
with
clear
and
definite
language.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
yes,
there
is
a
constitutional
question
raised
there,
and
i
think
one
would
then
perhaps,
going
to
shively
v.
bowlby,
and
assuming
that
shively
v.
bowlby
did
indeed
put
strict
parameters
around
departure
of
the
policy...
i.e.,
a
public
exigency
or
international
duty
called
for
a
declaration
of
intent...
then
i
suppose
one
could
inquire
into
whether
or
not
congress
in
approving
the
treaty
or
the
legislation
was
acting
within
those
constitutional
parameters
established
in
shively
v.
bowlby.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
i
believe
there
is.
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
regulatory
issue
and
would
say
this,
that
if
this
court's
decision
recently
in
colt
with
regard
to
the
taxing
authority
of
the
tribes
is
indeed
a
test,
which
i
perceive
that
it
is,
and
that
that
test
basically
has
three
prongs.
number
one,
that
indian
authority
or
sovereignty
over
a
nonmember
stops
at
tribal
land.
secondly,
that
a
legitimate
tribal
interest
must
be
perceived
in
the
regulation.
and
thirdly,
that
there
is
no
overriding
federal
policy
which
conflicts
with
the
regulation.
if
i
perceive
that
as
the
present
test
of
nonmember
exercise
of
sovereignty,
or
tribal
exercise
of
sovereignty
over
nonmembers,
then
resolution
74-05
doesn't
satisfy
any
of
that
three-prong
test.
number
one,
obviously
they
exert
their
sovereignty
over
the
nonmember
on
fee
lands,
not
indian
lands.
secondly,
i
don't
perceive
any
legitimate
indian
interest
here,
because
we're
talking
about,
not
the
mountain
area,
the
400,000
acres
set
aside
for
the
tribal
wildlife
commissary,
we're
talking
about
the
lowlands
that
theoretically
all
of
which
could
ultimately
end
up
in
non-indian
lands;
also,
a
commodity,
a
wildlife
commodity
in
which
the
indians
historically
have
not
shown
a
particular
interest
right
up
to
the
present
day,
as
admitted
by
their
own
tribal
historian.
they
showed
no
particular
interest
in
the
waterfowl
or
upland
game
birds.
additionally,
there
appears
to
be
a
conflicting
federal
policy
in
that
the
allotment
policy
of
1887
and
1920
was
aimed
at
bringing
the
indian
in
close
contact
with
the
whites
to
advance
indian
civilization.
moreover,
in
implementing
that
act,
there
was
an
overt
act
by
the
federal
government
vesting
fee
title
in
the
non-indian
without
any
reservations
or
restrictions.
moreover,
in
the
allotment
act
of
1920,
although
there
were
discrete
reservations
made
for
power
sites
and
for
mineral,
there
was
no
reference
to
hunting
and
fishing.
and
of
course,
congress
has
refused
the
opportunity
to
expand
section
1165
which
prohibits
hunting
and
fishing
on
indian
or
trust
lands
to
include
non-fee
lands.
in
addition,
if
this
court
approves
resolution
74-05,
it
seems
to
me
that
some
rather
serious
constitutional
questions
are
raised,
and
i
would
just
briefly
touch
upon
those.
this
is
not
a
case...
unlike
some
of
the
others...
where
a
tribe
is
trying
to
preserve
to
themselves
a
part
of
the
wildlife
resource.
they
are
attempting
to
confiscate
what
is
normally
an
inherent
constituent
value
of
fee
title
to
land,
and
that
is
the
non-indian's
right
to
hunt
and
fish
on
his
fee
lands
or
to
permit
anyone
he
wants
to
to
come
on
there
and
hunt
and
fish
on
that
land.
moreover,
that
particular
regulation
or
resolution
has
been
actively
supported
by
the
united
states
in
a
number
of
ways
ever
since
it's
been
enacted.
and
of
course
the
wilmington
parking
lot
v.
burton
case
comes
immediately
to
mind,
wherein
the
forces
of
the
state
or
the
power
of
the
state
was
placed
behind
discriminatory
conduct,
this
court
said
that
was
state
action.
the
action
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
this
case,
under
the
fifth
amendment,
is
much
more
overt
and
much
more
active,
including,
of
course,
this
lawsuit
itself.
and
additionally,
i
would
like
to
focus
upon
holt
civic
club
v.
tuscaloosa,
which
again
raises
a
very,
very
serious
question
as
to
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
of
a
city.
there,
in
a
split
decision,
this
court
apparently
approved
the
extraterritorial
powers
of
the
city
because
they
affected
nonresidents
of
the
city,
ergo
there
was
no
confiscation
of
the
voting
right;
and
secondly,
on
the
basis
that
it
encompassed
only
minor
things,
but
did
not
encompass
taxation,
zoning,
or
eminent
domain.
all
of
these
latter,
of
course,
appear
to
be
desires
of
the
crow
tribe
to
have
vindicated
by
this
particular
lawsuit.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
if
it
please
the
court,
i
do.
i'd
like
to
comment
briefly
upon
crow
tribe
exhibit
71qq
which
apparently
states
that
there
is
a
shortage
of
fish
and
game
caused
by
the
influx
of
non-indian
hunters.
the
unfortunate
part
of
that
letter
is
that
the
tribe
was
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
support
that
assertion
in
the
letter
at
trial.
they
basically
had
one
witness
there,
the
chief
game
warden...
who,
by
the
way,
is
one
of
eight
tribal
game
wardens...
bud
fritzler
testify.
mr.
fritzler,
page
263
of
the
transcript,
indicated
that
he
stopped,
i
believe,
20
to
30
non-indian
fishermen
and
inquired
of
them
what
they
were
doing.
at
269,
i
believe
it
is,
he
cited
one
incident
involving
non-indian
having
coolers
full
of
fish.
superimposed
upon
this
and
i
think
significant
in
light
of
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
sea
coast
products
v.
douglas,
and
hughes
v.
oklahoma,
is
the
fact
that
the
tribe
has
done
absolutely
nothing
with
regard
to
preserving
this
scarce
resource
by
controlling
the
acquisition
of
wildlife
and
fish
by
tribal
members.
tribal
members
are
free
to
hunt
at
any
season.
the
record
is
replete
with
examples
of
the
fact
that
they
exercise
that
right
in
all
seasons,
including
in
the
spring,
when
the
cow
elk
is
pregnant;
including
later
on,
when
the
fawn
is
by
her
side.
mr.
urban
l.
roth
no
limits,
your
honor,
absolutely
none.
but
i
think
significant,
as
far
as
the
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned,
is
the
xx
to
this
day
they
do
not
have
a
significant
interest
in
the
fishery.
moreover,
as
we
have
already
indicated,
it's
a
put-and-take
fishery,
and
montana
was
putting
the
fish
in
and
its
fishermen
were
merely
taking
them
out
again.
so
it
wasn't
a
commodity
that
was
supplied
by
the
tribe
at
all
nor
even
introduced
on
the
reservation
by
the
tribe.
so
this
bare
assertion
that
for
some
reason
the
wildlife
resource
is
endangered
just
isn't
true.
now,
with
regard
to--
mr.
urban
l.
roth
--yes,
there
is.
and
certainly
i
think
this
court,
as
in
washington
v.
fishing
vessel
association,
has
shown
a
regard
for
indian
interests,
indian
tribes
having
a
percentage
of
the
resource;
that's
true.
but
in
this
particular
case,
if
it
please
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
particular
portion
of
the
wildlife
resource
is
not
available
to
supply
them
with
food.
and
i'm
sure,
if
the
pressure
on
the
wildlife
resource
of
the
reservation
became
too
heavy,
then
the
federal
courts,
as
they
did
in
washington
v.
fishing
vessel
association,
could
at
the
behest
of
the
tribe
allocate
some
percentage
of
the
resource
to
the
tribe
and
some
percentage
to
the
non-indians
and
regulate
perhaps
even
the
number
of
fishermen
and
hunters
who
would
enter
on
the
reservation.
but
in
doing
so,
they
would
balance
the
interests
of
both
and
would
consider
whether
or
not
there
was
indeed
pressure
upon
that
resource,
which,
of
course,
there
is
no
evidence
of
there
being
any
substantive
impact
upon
the
resource
in
this
particular
case.
with
regard
to
the
denigration
of
the
holt
case,
i
would
think
that
the
case
of
minnesota
v.
hitchcock,
which
preceded
united
states
v.
holt
state
bank,
and
in
which
this
court
made
a
study
of
all
of
the
preexisting
treaties
leading
up
to
the
creation
of
the
red
lake
reservation
would
have
put
to
rest
that
particular
comment
upon
the
whole
case.
thank
you
very
much.
