justice
white
mr.
roth?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
claim
here
that's
been
sustained
in
favor
of
the
tribe
indicates
that
they
own
not
only
the
bed
of
the
river
but
the
water
in
the
stream,
in
the
sense
that
they
could
control,
if
they
wanted
to,
the
navigability
of
the
stream?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
judgment
below
would
enable
the
tribe
not
only
to
regulate
fishing
in
the
river
but
the
navigation
of
it?
justice
white
well,
how
do
you
read
the
holding
below?
justice
white
of
the
entire
stream?
justice
white
because,
after
all,
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
control
of
navigation.
justice
white
furthermore,
there's
no
necessary
connection
between
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
the
ability
to
fish
in
the
water.
justice
white
well,
but,
as
you
well
know,
in
the
western
states
there
is
certainly
a
major
controversy
between
those
who
claim
they
own
the
bed
of
the
river
and
people
who
want
to
float
the
river.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
that
the
holding
below
would
indicate
the
tribe
could
keep
people
from
floating
the
river
fishing?
justice
white
as
long
as
they
didn't
get
on
the
banks
or
the
bottom
of
the
stream?
justice
white
there's
a
rule
in
some
states,
you
know.
justice
white
well,
the
holding
below
would
say
the
tribe
could
prevent
floaters
on
the
river?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
they
can
control
navigation,
you
told
me.
justice
white
no,
under
the
holding
below,
they
could.
justice
white
do
you
think
the
court
below
then
said,
well,
the
treaty
gave
the
bottom
of
the
river,
but
it
didn't
give
the
river?
the
treaty
did
not
give
the
tribe
control
of
the
river?
is
that
what
the
holding
was?
justice
white
i'm
not
talking
about
a
servitude.
i'm
talking
about
whether
the
tribe
had
the
authority
to
control
navigation
on
the
river.
justice
white
well,
if
it
didn't,
why
would
the
treaty
give
the
indians
the
bottom
of
the
river
but
not
the
power
to
control
navigation?
and
if
it
didn't
give
the
power
to
control
navigation,
why
would
it
give
them
the
bed
of
the
river?
justice
white
well,
the
question
is
the
effect
of
the
treaty
in
that
respect.
justice
white
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
included
the
big
horn
river.
justice
white
and
the
argument
is
that
therefore
they
had
the
bottom
of
the
river.
well,
why
didn't
they
have
the
power
to
control
navigation
under
that
same
treaty?
justice
white
well,
the
question
in
the
case
is...
one
of
the
questions
in
the
case
is
fishing
in
the
river.
justice
white
it
isn't
taking
things
off
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
if
they
don't
have
control
over
navigation
in
the
river
and
the
use
of
the
water
in
the
river,
what
is
the
authority
to
prevent
fishing
in
the
river?
justice
white
well,
where
is
the
flathead
case
now?
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
happen
to
judge
jameson
there?
justice
white
so
that
case
is
settled?
i
mean,
that
case
is--
justice
white
--in
the
9th
circuit?
justice
white
well,
apparently
the
9th
circuit
doesn't
think
there's
anything
inconsistent
between
the
flathead
case
and
the
big
horn
case?
justice
white
mr.
roth,
could
you
tell
me
just
a
little
bit
about
the
big
horn?
how
large
a
stream
is
it?
justice
white
so
how
much...
what's
the
cubic
foot/second
flow,
do
you
know?
justice
white
well,
but
you
fish
it,
you
wade
it
to
fish,
a
lot
of
times?
at
some
places?
justice
white
from
the
yellowtail
dam,
and
so
fishing
below
that
is...
so
it
comes
out
as
a
steady
temperature,
is
it?
justice
white
it
comes
out
the
bottom
of
the
dam,
so
it's
cold
water?
justice
white
and
it's
relatively
steady
flow?
justice
white
but
you
can
wade
the
edges
at
various
places?
justice
white
and
a
lot
of
people
fish
it
that
way,
i
suppose?
justice
white
and
a
lot
of
people
would
like
to
stop
in
quiet
water
and
get
out
of
their
boats
and
fish?
justice
white
and
it
depends...
and
who
owns
the
bottom
would
determine
whether
you
can
do
that?
justice
white
well,
it
didn't
sound
like
you...
in
this
court,
mr.
claiborne.
justice
white
well,
mr.
claiborne,
the
easy
answer...
not
the
easy,
but
one
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
is
that
if
you...
if
someone
owns
the
riverbed
but
someone
else
has
a
right
to
fish
in
the
river
as
long
as
he
doesn't
touch
the
bottom,
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
trespass
if
he
gets
out
of
his
boat
and--
--that's
right.
he
can
float
down
the
river,
no
matter
who
owns
the
bed,
and
fish.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
follows?
justice
white
in
this
litigation?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
it
would
violate...
how
about
just
floating
the
river
without
fishing?
can
the
tribe
exclude
people
from
the
river
under
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
white
well,
the
river
is
within
the
tribal
boundary,
within
reservation
boundaries,
and
the
statutes
say
that
they
can
exclude
people
from
the
reservation.
justice
white
not
on
the
river,
eh?
is
that
it?
justice
white
so,
there's
a
right
to
navigate,
but
not
a
right
to
fish?
justice
white
i
mean,
that's
your
claim?
justice
white
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
accept
the
9th
circuit's
ruling
with
respect
to
nonmember
fee
owners?
justice
white
--well,
when
you
accommodate
them,
what
do
you
do
about
the
riverbed
in
those
places
of
the
river
where
the
riparian
owners
are
fee
owners,
nonmember
fee
owners?
justice
white
didn't
the
9th
circuit
say
that
they
did?
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
white
how
can
you
fish
on
land?
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i,
now--
justice
white
--let's
assume
that
on
both
sides
of
the
river
there's
a
nonmember
fee
owner,
and
that
they
both
live
on
their
property.
now
who
owns
the
riverbed
between
those
two
pieces
of
property
under
the
9th
circuit?
justice
white
we're
talking
about
the
big
horn
river.
justice
white
but
the
riparian
owners
may
nevertheless
fish
in
the
river?
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
that
they
can
fish
on
their
own
land?
justice
white
i
understand
that.
you
don't
think
that
the
9th
circuit
would
indicate
at
all
that
the
riparian
owner
on
the
big
horn
could
fish
in
the
river?
justice
white
but
the
riparian
owners
here
on
the
big
horn
may
navigate?
justice
white
is
it
stocked?
justice
white
by
whom?
justice
white
prior
to
this
decision,
who
did
it?
justice
white
what
authority
do
you
have,
or
what
do
you
think
the
basis
is
for
the
tying
of
ownership
of
fishing
to
the
ownership
of
the
river
bottom?
in
all
sorts
of
western
states
they
are
completely
separate
notions,
but
your
colleague
suggested
that
throughout
this
case
the
assumption
has
been
that
fishing
belongs,
the
fishery
belongs
to
the
person
who
owns
the
riverbed.
justice
white
that
doesn't
address
my
question,
does
it?
justice
white
well,
i
would
think
you
would
make
that
argument
even
if
the
state
owned
the
bottom.
justice
white
well,
so
again,
i'm
asking
you,
why
in
this
case
has
the
ownership
notion
been
tied
to
the
fishery?
is
there
some
case
that
you
know
of
that
binds
the
two
together?
justice
white
except
this
one?
justice
white
but
you
could
either...
do
you
also
concede,
as
i
gather
the
united
states
does,
or
states,
that
the
tribe
could
not
exclude
the
people
from
floating
the
river?
justice
white
is
any
part
of
the
big
horn
lake
on
the
reservation?
justice
white
any
part
of
the
lake
above
the
dam?
justice
white
so
that
the
bottom
of
the
lake
is
not
involved
in
this
case?
