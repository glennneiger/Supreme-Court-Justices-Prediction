mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
we
have
to
keep
a
couple
of
things
in
mind
at
the
very
outset
of
this
case.
the
respondents
are
three
citizens
of
the
republic
of
mexico
who
have
gone
into
a
federal
district
court
with
a
straightforward
question
to
that
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court...
there's
an
export
ban
that
says
that
after
mcdougal
has
acquired
water,
pumped
it
from
the
ground,
stored
it
in
his
storage
tanks,
mcdougal
cannot
sell
that
water
to
me,
a
mexican
citizen,
because
in
granting
a
conditional
use
permit
for
no
reasons
relating
to
land
use,
intensity
of
use
or
anything,
the
county
of
imperial
has
simply
decided
to
ban
the
export
of
that
water
from
that
particular
parcel.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
you
might
be
hinting
at
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
foreigner,
non-citizen
of
the
united
states
might
bring
an
action--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--well,
i
would
suggest
that
in
our
allegations
we
have
pointed
out
that
these
particular
plaintiffs
are
lawfully
within
the
united
states,
and
once
you
are
lawfully
within
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
constitution
talks
in
terms
of
persons
are
protected,
and
it
doesn't
say,
citizens
of
this
country,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
person--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
i
believe
that
a
person
lawfully
in
this
country
exercising
the
right
as
a
purchaser
ought
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
basic
fabric
of
this
nation,
the
commerce
clause,
in
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
think
that
that
question
is
answered
by
the
principles
of
res
judicata,
and
if
res
judicata
would
apply
because
they
were
in
those
proceedings,
then
i
would
agree
with
your
statement.
however,
i
am
somewhat
concerned
that,
for
example,
i
believe
in
one
opinion
of
this
court...
i
believe
it
was
huffman
v.
pursue,
ltd.
,
there
was
some
language
to
the
effect
that
a
litigant
in
a
state
court
might
come
back
in
a
federal
court
and
challenge,
but
that
was
a
very
limited
statement
in
that
decision--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--and
i
don't
believe
that
i
would
press
that
point
here.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
no,
we
weren't;
that
was
my
next
comment.
my
clients...
and
this
is
something,
i
wish
i
could
start
over
in
this
case.
instead
of
labeling
it
"guillermo
gallego
munoz"
as
the
first
party,
i
would
have
put
juan
de
leon
in
because
juan
de
leon
wasn't
even
in
business
when
these
state
court
proceedings
were
going
forward,
and
my
point
is,
my
clients,
these
respondents
have
never
had
a
day
in
a
court,
be
it
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court.
they've
raised
an
issue;
at
some
point
it
has
to
be
answered.
and
turning--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so
because
i
subscribe
to
the
view
that
there
is
a
legitimate
police
power
in
local
and
state
government
to
regulate
land
use.
now,
i
think
that
what
makes
this
case
so
unique
is
the
direct,
explicit
holding
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
this
particular
restriction
is
not
land
use
or--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--i
would
think
that
if
that
customer
were
raising
it
under
the
commerce
clause,
i
believe
he
would
have
standing,
and
i
would
just
revert
to
my
position:
that
is,
if
you
are
in
this
country
lawfully
discharging
a
business,
you
have
a
right
to
invoke
the
protections
afforded
in
the
constitution
to
raise
it.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
think
you're
going
to
have
to
show
some
interest--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--i
think
you'd
have
to
show
some
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
this
court
has
held--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
arguably,
yes.
let's
put
it
in
another
light.
what
if
i
am
driving
from
california
to
texas
and
i
have
an
old-type
automobile
with
a
radiator
and
i
want
to
stop
in
at
the
mcdougal
well
and
fill
up
my
radiator;
mcdougal
says,
no.
you're
taking
the
water
outside
of
the
county.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
have
the
right
to
bring
that,
because
i
have
been
directly
harmed
by
a
regulation
of
a
governmental
entity
that
has
said--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
read
it
that
far.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
think
that
somebody
who
can
show
a
relationship--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--correct.
i
would
say
that
someone
who
can
allege
and
show
that
they
have
an
interest
in
raising
the
issue
can
raise
it.
i
don't
think
you
could
some
into
the
federal
court
and
say,
well,
i
might
want
to
purchase
water
sometime.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
issue
was
lost
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
specifically
refused
to
rule
on
the
issue.
and
i
think
that
if
we
are
going
to
assert
that
mcdougal
went
out
and
found
straw
men
and
somehow
manufactured
a
lawsuit,
that
that
is
an
element
of
proof
in
the
trial.
and
i
have
to
point
out,
we're
here
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
any
connection
between
these
plaintiffs
and
mcdougal
save
three
isolated
acts.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
point
out
to
you
that
that
is
in
the
second
cause
of
action
wherein
munoz
is
seeking
specific
performance
of
his
agreement
with
mcdougal,
and
in
that
sense--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--that
is
a
true
statement.
for
purposes
of
res
judicata,
though,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say,
because
i
am
going
to
be
the
buyer
i
have
automatically
been
foreclosed
because
the
seller
has
somehow
been
foreclosed
in
a
state
proceeding
which
did
not
reach
the
issue.
i
think
we
open
a
dangerous
door
if
we
tell
government,
local
government,
that
it
may
grant
and
deny
land
use
permits
or
any
kind
of
permits
for
reasons
wholly
unrelated
to
the
local
purpose
land
use,
and
if
a
seller
is
somehow
estopped
to
raise
or
challenge
that
issue,
that
the
whole
world
is
barred
from
ever
challenging
it.
i
would
suspect
that
that
would
open
doors
to
novel
methods
of
discrimination
against
international
commerce,
state
commerce,
and
a
host
of
other
things
that
i
think
are
protected
activities.
if
i
might--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
and
in
its
self-executing
form,
the
way
restrictions
imposed
by
state
and
local
governments
are
raised,
they
are
raised
by
those
who
are
harmed,
and
that
recognizes,
i
think,
that
a
state
has
a
right
to
regulate
in
an
area
that
may
impact
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
hughes
v.
oklahoma,
if
you're
going
to
regulate
in
that
area,
then
you'd
better
do
it
in
a
manner
that
is
not
discriminatory
or
overly
burdensome
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
here
we've
got
a
flat,
outright--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
no,
he
would
be
in
the
shoes
of
perhaps
munoz.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
correct.
what
about
altus,
oklahoma
v.
carr?
it
was
the
purchaser
there
who
wanted
to
take
the
water
out
of
texas.
and
i
think
that
decision
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
of
texas
could
not
enforce
an
export
ban
and
the
residents
of
altus,
oklahoma,
brought
that
suit.
i
think
in
reviewing
this
decision,
it
is
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
than
these
parties
in
this
case
have
not
had
their
day
in
court.
they
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
state
proceedings.
one
of
them
didn't
even
exist
in
the
business.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
have
res
judicata
in
this
case
we
have
to
have
two
things:
one,
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
which,
when
the
california
supreme
court
says
it's
not
going
to
decide
the
issue,
in
my
view
does
not
constitute
a
decision
on
the
merits.
and
the
next
thing
we've
got
to
have
is
some
relationship
between
the
parties
and
the
party
that
appeared
in
the
california
court
in
order
to
hold
him
and
bind
them
as
privies.
now,
privy
is
kind
of
a
shorthand
method
of
saying
simply
that
we
think
there's
enough
connection
between
these
people
that
they
ought
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
it
would
be
as
to
mcdougal,
who
participated
in
that
litigation.
i
think
that
with
respect
to
parties
who
were
not
party
to
the
state
litigation,
we're
talking
about
collateral
estoppel
and
we're
talking
about
issues
that
were
actually
decided,
issues
that
we
might
use
as
a
sword
or
a
shield
against
those
non-parties
and
for
purposes
of
collateral
estoppel
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
items
that
might
be
asserted
for
that
purpose
are
issues
that
were
actually
decided.
and
i
come
back
to
the
central
issue
that
the
question
presented
to
the
federal
district
court,
i.e.
and
to
wit,
the
ban
on
the
export
of
water,
has
never
been
decided
by
any
court.
at
some
point
in
time,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
third
parties
who
have
never
been
in
a
court
proceedings
ought
to
have
the
right
to
have
the
question
decided
either
for
them
or
against
them,
unless
we
can
say
that
those
parties
were
so
close
to
the
proceedings
in
california
that
they
ought
to
be
bound,
and
that
somehow
mcdougal
stood
in
their
shoes.
i
would
point
out,
how
could
mcdougal
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
three
mexicans,
when
the
very
issue
that
they
were
concerned
with
was
the
one
that
he's
estopped
to
raise?
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
yes,
sir,
if
i
might.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
not
really.
there
were
other
things
that
the
county
of
imperial
could
have
done.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
it
was
rendered
unenforceable
in
the
sense
that
the
county
of
imperial
was
restrained
from
enforcing
the
regulation.
it
seems
to
me
that
mcdougal's
duties--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--well,
okay,
i
rest
on
hale
v.
bimco,
number
one.
i
think
the
holding
in
hale
v.
bimco
in
this
court
is
that
third
parties
simply
are
not
bound
by
2283.
this
court
in
mitchum
v.
foster
said
that
the
test
to
determine
the
applicability
of
2283
is
to
look
back
at
the
law
as
it
existed
before
toucey
v.
new
york.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
toucey
v.
new
york
and
hale
v.
bimco,
as
well
as
footnoted
hale
v.
bimco.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
well,
that's
exactly
what
happened,
though,
in
hale
v.
bimco.
hale
v.
bimco
is
on
all
fours
with
this
case.
the
state
of
florida
sued
hale
and
said,
enforce
this
interstate
regulation.
it
went
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
the
florida
supreme
court
after
demur
said,
yes,
that's
constitutional.
bimco
trading
company,
third
parties,
come
in,
sue
hale,
say,
don't
enforce
that;
i
want
an
injunction
barring
you
from
enforcing
it.
the
federal
district
court
issues
it,
the
florida
courts
stay
proceedings
as
have
the
courts
in
california,
in
deference
to
a
final
determination
of
the
federal
issue.
and
in
that
decision
the
court
held,
in
hale
v.
bimco,
that
third
parties
are
not
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
and
proceeded
to
render
unconstitutional
the
particular
regulation
in
question
and
said
that
they
found
it
very
hard
to
do
so
after
it
had
been
decided
constitutional
by
the
highest
state
court
of
florida,
but
they
felt
that
they
had
to
do
it.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--it's
unenforceable
to
the
extent
that
mcdougal
has
commenced
selling
of
water,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
status
of
that
injunction
is
anymore,
after
the
somewhat
delphic
contempt
order
issued
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i've
said,
first
of
all,
the
anti-injunction
statute
doesn't
apply
because
of
hale
v.
bimco
and
the
policies
of
federalism
underlying
that.
secondly,
though,
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
the
anti-injunction
statute
applies
we
have
pled
this
case
in
the
context
of
a
civil
rights
proceeding.
i
believe
that
in
that
sense
that
mitchum
v.
foster
provides
the
exception
there.
i
think
that
to
hold
2283
applicable
in
this
case
we're
going
to
have
to
seriously
diminish
the
holding
in
hale
v.
bimco,
or
overrule
it.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
principles
of
federalism
that
this
court
has
announced
in
a
series
of
cases
don't
warrant
it
in
this
particular
fact.
one
of
the
principles
that
we
look
at
in
the
question
of
enjoining
a
state
court,
when
we
say,
you
shouldn't,
is
we
want
to
allow
the
state
courts
to
try
the
cases
before
them
free
from
interference
by
federal
courts.
there
is
no
proceeding
pending
in
a
state
court
of
california
wherein
this
constitutional
issue
is
going
to
be
interfered
with
by
any
federal
district
court.
the
state
courts
have
deferred
to
the
federal
courts
with
respect
to
the
issue.
they
have
not
interfered,
so
that
particular
policy
does
not
require
2283
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
yes,
it
did,
and
i
think
that
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
superior
court,
as
i
said,
in
a
delphic
order
it
said
to
mcdougal,
mcdougal,
you're
ordered
to
stop
selling
water
30
days
after
the
9th
circuit
judgment
against
you
becomes
final,
and
if
the
county
loses
in
the
9th
circuit
the
thing
is
stayed
until
resolution
on
appeal.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
mcdougal
filed
a
writ
of
mandate
when
he
was
found
in
contempt.
it
went
up
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
and
the
district
court
of
appeals
has
stayed
any
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
contempt
against
mcdougal,
pending
the
outcome
of
this
decision
in
this
court,
so
far
as
even
citing
the
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
courts
in
california
have
specifically
deferred.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
well,
in
order
to
get
a
deferrence
from
the
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
to
turn
down
mcdougal's
writ
of
mandamus
and
then
he
would
have
gone
to
the
state
court.
the
florida
thing
is
a
little
different
in
hale
v.
bimco
because
you
were
dealing
in
a
situation
of
original
jurisdiction
in
florida.
the
original
action
was
brought
in
the
florida
supreme
court
by
virtue
of
some
statutes
in
florida
which
allowed
initial
proceedings
in
the
supreme
court
there.
we
couldn't...
mcdougal
could
not
get
to
the
california
supreme
court,
absent
denial
of
relief
at
the
court
of
appeals
level,
and
he
was
granted
that
relief.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
policy
that
we
talk
about
is
when
we're
in
doubt
about
issuing
an
injunction
we're
to
resolve
that
doubt
in
favor
of
allowing
the
state
court
proceedings
to
proceed
in
an
orderly
manner
to
a
final
decision
on
the
merits.
there
are
no
state
court
proceedings
proceeding
anywhere
with
respect
to
getting
us
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
simple
question
provided
by
these
three
mexican
nationals:
is
the
export
ban
constitutional
or
not?
it's
not
proceeding
in
any
court
in
the
state
of
california.
and
i
think
that
when
we
look
at
2283,
it
uses
the
word
"pending
proceedings".
and
i
think
that
those
phrases
have
to
have
some
meaning
of
currency,
something
in
the
present
tense
that
must
be
occurring.
in
this
case
there
is
no
california
court
contending
that
the
regulation
is
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
it's
not
before
any
california
court.
the
only
parties
contending
that
the
regulation
is
a
constitutional
exercise
is
the
county
of
imperial.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
not
violated
any
principles
of
federalism
when
a
third
party
comes
in
under
this
court's
decision
in
hale
v.
bimco
and
there
is
no
decision
or
proceeding
going
forward
in
the
state
court,
we
simply
have
not
violated
those
principles
of
federalism
on
which
2283
rests.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
yes,
there
was.
in
fact,
in
hale...
well,
pending
in
the
sense
that
it
was
commenced
and
in
hale
the
florida
supreme
court
stayed
those
proceedings,
awaiting
result
on
the
constitutional
issues
from
this
court.
so
in
that
sense
i
think
it
was
pending.
they
had
brought
a
suit
in
florida
to
specifically
enforce
the
regulation
in
question.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
no
california
court
is
considering
the
constitutionality
of
the
ban
in
question.
the
california
supreme
court
has
just
simply
said,
we're
not
going
to
decide
it.
and
then
they
footnote
us
to
altus,
oklahoma,
v.
carr,
which
seems
to
say
that
the
particular
export
ban
is
unconstitutional.
they
hint
at
it;
they
don't
come
out
and
say
it.
i
think
we
have
a
policy
underlying
2283
of
avoiding
duplication
of
legal
proceedings
when
a
single
suit
could
satisfy
the
interests
of
the
parties
and
all
the
issues
could
be
resolved.
there
is
only
one
single
suit
in
which
the
interests
of
the
parties
can
be
resolved
and
the
questions
answered,
and
that's
the
suit
that
is
here
today.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
on
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
more
i
thought
about
the
2283
issue,
the
more
i
came
to
believe
that
when
you're
dealing
with
third
parties
2283
is
not
applicable
and
you're
dealing
with
principles
of
res
judicata
because
the
analysis
that
you
would
go
through
in
res
judicata
ought
to
answer
most
of
the
questions
that
deal
with
2283.
so
that
that
would
reinforce
in
my
view
this
court's
holding
in
hale
v.
bimco,
that
2283
does
not
apply
to
third
parties.
because
when
we
have
third
parties,
i
think
we're
talking
about
res
judicata.
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
we
couched
our
lawsuit
in
civil
rights
terms
indicating--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--i
was
getting
to
that.
it
says,
1981,
there.
i
think
the
rule
the
federal
courts
is
notice
pleading,
and
i
think
that
as
we
have
spelled
it
out
in
that
cause
of
action
it
can
be
read
as
a
civil
rights
cause
of
action
under
1983--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
had
i
to
do
it
over
again
today,
i
would
like
to
change
the
1>
["]
to
a
3>
["]
to
make
that
point
more
explicit.
but
you're
correct;
it
says
1>
["]
in
the
pleadings,
but
the
pleadings
are
couched
in
the
terms,
i
think,
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
i
do
believe
the
courts
have
held
pleaders
to
specific
numbers
when
dealing
with
civil
rights
actions.
we
have
alleged
that
there
is
much
more
to
this
than
meets
the
eye.
in
that
fact,
i
would
just
turn
your
attention
to
page
90,
91
of
the
appendix,
so
that
we
can
see
what
kind
of
local
interests
are
involved.
the
minutes
of
the
hearing,
when
the
particular
export
ban
was
placed
on
the
property,
the
attorney
for
the
predecessor
in
interest,
mr.
sands,
he
says,
mr.
sands--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--yes,
91a.
those
are
the
minutes
of
the
proceedings
before
the
board
of
supervisors
and
the
planning
commission.
"mr.
sands
questioned
if
he
would
be
in
favor
of
a
limited
period
of
time
as
previously
requested,
up
to
12-31-68.
"
that's
to
allow
the
continuation
of
sale
of
water
to
mexico,
and
a
statement
that
it
would
not
increase
the
amount
of
water
exported
from
the
county
of
imperial;
it
would
be
the
same
amount
of
water.
response:
"chairman
kilgore
stated
that
in
regard
to
a
temporary
period
of
time
five
minutes
would
be
too
much.
"
yes,
we
have
alleged
civil
rights
allegations
in
this
case,
so
that
it
is
more
than
simple
interstate
commerce.
and
if
we
are
going
to
apply
2283,
i
believe
we're
within
an
exception
to
that.
i
think
that,
2283,
the
final
outcome
of
2283
being
applied
in
this
case
is
simply
going
to
be
to
divest
federal
district
courts
of
diversity
jurisdiction
in
this
circumstance.
you
are
going
to
be
saying,
go
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
it's
a
federal
question
case
and
the
ultimate
result
of
2283's
application
would
be
to
tell
a
plaintiff
such
as
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
respondents,
to
bring
these
questions
in
a
state
court
because--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--2283
would
bar
you
from
injunctive
relief.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
well,
we
could
go
to
a
state
court
but
i
think
the
parties--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--well,
we
would
have
had
to
have
brought
a
new
lawsuit.
the
result
of
that
would
be
2283
does
not
say,
thou
shalt
continue
your
pending
lawsuits.
it
says,
thou
shalt
leave
federal
court
and
just
start
a
new
lawsuit.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
have
no
claims...
we
have
never
been
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
i
started
this
case
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
mcdougal
was
hit
with
an
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
by
the
county
of
imperial
from
the
superior
court.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
and
the
superior
court
said,
no,
the
export
ban
is
not
with
respect
to
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
yes,
the
state
superior--
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
--that's
correct
but
i
would
just
for
the
record
say,
my
clients
don't
want
to
be
in
the
state
court.
they
have
a
right
to
access
to
the
federal
court
and
for
a
variety
of
reasons
choose
not
to
be
in
the
state
court.
following
the
line
of
what
happened,
mcdougal
was
first
told
that
the
restriction
was
land
use
oriented
and
did
not
burden
interstate
commerce.
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
california
court
of
appeals
said,
it's
patently
unconstitutional,
it
burdens
interstate
commerce,
and
they
declared
the
entire
conditional
use
permit
void.
and
mcdougal
was
left
with
nothing.
mcdougal
appealed
to
the
california
supreme
court,
which
sidestepped
the
issue
of
what
happens
in
california
with
respect
to
a
conditional
use
permit
which
has
an
unconstitutional
condition
attached
to
it,
it
sidestepped
it
by
saying,
you're
estopped.
and
that
makes,
i
think,
a
good
deal
of
sense,
because
there
are
thousands
of
restrictions
on
conditional
use
permits
in
the
state
of
california,
very
few
of
which
probably
rise
to
the
dignity
of
a
constitutional
challenge,
and
i
don't
think
california
courts
wanted
to
open
their
courts
to
those
kinds
of
challenges.
mr.
william
h.
kronberger,
jr.
yes,
he
did
and
this
court
determined
that
the
estoppel
was
an
independent
state
grounds
upon
which
the
judgment
might
rest.
yes,
he
did.
i
would
like
to
just,
briefly
at
the
end,
say
that
the
federal
policies
that
would
be
thwarted
by
application
of
2283...
and
i
think
the
implicit
overruling
of
hale
v.
bimco,
will
be
to
tell
plaintiffs
that
2283
may
be
used
as
a
forum
shopping
tool
by
the
respondent
or
defendant.
all
they
need
do
is
raise
2283
to
a
third
party
and
that
third
party
who
has
never
been
in
a
state
court...
he's
told,
gee,
you
should
have
started
your
lawsuit
in
a
state
court
when
we
had
a
federal
question
with
diversity
jurisdiction.
in
conclusion,
i
would
suggest
that
to
apply
2283
to
third
party
non-litigants
would
elevate
the
provisions
of
that
section
against
the
basic
fundamental
notion
and
concept
that
parties
ought
to
be
given
their
day
in
the
court
of
their
choice
and
with
respect
to
federal
questions
they
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
federal
questions
to
a
federal
court
to
litigate
it.
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
that
parties
who
were
not
participating
in
state
court
proceedings
should
ever
be
denied
injunctive
relief
in
a
federal
court
when
it
is
properly
brought
before
that
court.
thank
you.
