mr.
james
h.
harmon
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
it
is
permissible,
consistent
with
principles
of
res
judicata
and
the
anti-injunction
act,
for
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
a
ground
water
exportation
restriction
in
mr.
mcdougal's
use
permit
when
the
california
supreme
court
earlier
ruled
the
restriction
enforceable.
if
i
may,
before
going
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
the
geographical
setting
for
this
case.
in
this
court's
recent
opinion
in
bryant
v.
yellen,
the
court
described
the
imperial
valley
as
an
area
located
south
of
the
salton
sea
in
southeastern
california.
it
lies
below
sea
level
and
is
an
arid
desert
in
its
natural
state.
that
case,
the
160-acre
limitation
case,
dealt
with
lands
in
imperial
county
which
are
within
the
irrigation
district
boundaries
and
are
irrigated.
mr.
mcdougal's
parcel,
however,
lies
on
the
west
mesa
of
imperial
county,
an
area
totally
dependent
on
ground
water
supplies.
going
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
california
supreme
court
found
mr.
mcdougal
estopped
from
challenging,
and
thereby
bound
by
the
export
restriction
in
his
use
permit
based
on
facts
which
showed
that
his
predecessor,
with
counsel,
agreed
to
the
imposition
of
the
export
restriction,
abided
by
it,
and
benefited
from
the
limited
permit
as
issued.
further,
mr.
mcdougal
when
he
purchased
the
property
was
aware
of
the
restriction.
when
mr.
mcdougal
went
to
the
county
officials
and
demanded
removal
of
the
export
restriction,
he
was
informed
that
he
should
make
application
for
a
new
conditional
use
permit.
instead
of
applying
for
a
use
permit,
mr.
mcdougal
simply
defied
the
county
authorities,
entered
the
subject
brokerage
contract
with
respondent
munoz
and
immediately
as
many
as
44
tank
trucks
carrying
250,000
gallons
a
day
began
export
of
water
to
mexicali,
mexico.
one
of
the
major
allegations
of
the
respondent's
complaint
is
that
enforcement
of
the
subject
export
restriction
will
cause
economic
hardship
to
them
by
requiring
them
to
go
eight
miles
farther
north
in
the
county,
to
the
so-called
clifford
well,
to
buy
water
for
export.
it
is
alleged
that
the
price
of
water
is
higher
at
the
clifford
well,
also
in
the
county
eight
miles
north.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
approximately,
i
would
say,
six
miles,
your
honor.
the
well
site--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--the
well
is
on
highway
98,
which
kind
of
parallels
the
border,
and
the
ocotillo
well
is
eight
miles
north
on
highway
98.
i
believe
that
the
res
judicata
issue
is
the
major
issue
in
the
case.
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
rejected
the
county's
argument
on
res
judicata
by
concluding
that
the
mcdougal
decision
is
not
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
as
to
the
respondents'
cause
of
action.
that's
fundamentally
incorrect.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
it
was
an
estopped
judgment,
and
i've
indicated
what
the
facts
were
substantiated
in
that
estoppel.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
exactly.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
exactly.
and
justice
white,
i
will
get
to
the
privity
question
in
a
moment,
if
i
may.
but
importantly--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes,
indeed.
importantly,
recognize
that
the
9th
circuit
did
not
even
reach
the
privity
issue.
it
simply
concluded
that
this
is
not
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
as
to
the
respondents'
action.
that
can't
be
true,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
will
get
to
that.
importantly,
the
issue
of
the
enforceability
of
the
export
restriction
was
the
central
issue
in
the
mcdougal
case.
after
five
years
of
litigation,
finally
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
it
was
enforceable.
indeed,
the
decision
is
based
on--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--affirmed
that
portion
of
the
injunction.
now,
on
the
issue
of
what
is
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits,
for
purposes
of
res
judicata,
professor
moore
indicates
that
a
test
is
where
there
is
a
measure
of
identity
so
that
the
different
judgment
in
a
second
action
would
destroy
or
imperil
rights
or
interest
established
by
the
first
judgment.
here,
your
honors,
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
robs
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
of
all
of
its
vitality
and
meaning.
in
one
case
we've
got
the
california
supreme
court
concluding
that
the
export
restriction
is
enforceable,
now
the
district
court
is
telling
the
county
officials
that
the
export
restriction
must
be
enjoined.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
clear
that
the
focal
point
made
by
the
9th
circuit
is
erroneous
and
requires
reversal.
now,
going
to
the
issue
of
privity,
may
i
again
remind
the
court
that
the
9th
circuit
did
not
address,
did
not
even
reach
the
issue
of
privity.
the
last
page
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
there
is
a
statement
that
indicates
that
assuming
that
the
respondents
are
in
privity,
they
would
not
be
bound
because
of
the
prior
conclusion
on
the
cause
of
action
issue.
the
record,
however,
establishes
relationships
between
mcdougal
and
the
respondents
which
i
believe
make
it
clear
they
should
be
regarded
as
being
in
privity
with
mcdougal.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
contractual
relationship
between
respondent
munoz
and
mcdougal.
munoz
has
been
an
integral
part
of
the
mcdougal
operation
since
its
inception.
a
verified
complaint
in
the
federal
action
indicates
that
munoz
is
the
broker
for
sale
of
water
to
bottling
companies
in
mexicali.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
think
that's
correct.
certainly
in
the
reading
i've
done,
the
thrust
of
many
writers'
opinions
is
that
you're
to
look
at
the
substance,
not
just
the
form
of
the
situation,
and
if
there
has
been
a
meaningful
relationship
between
the
parties
and
those
who
would
also
be
bound
by
the
preclusionary
rule,
where
they've
had
the
opportunity
to
intervene
and
litigate
the
case,
they
should
likewise
be
bound.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
it
is.
the
leading
case
there
is
enterprise
irrigation.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
the
cases
clearly
establish
that
estoppel
is
an
independent
and
adequate
ground
for--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--i'm
further
suggesting
that
the
respondents
are
in
privity
with
mcdougal.
i've
alluded
to
the
contractual
relationship.
furthermore,
if
i
can
draw
the
court's
attention
to
page
16a
of
the
appendix,
specifically
paragraph
4
of
the
complaint,
the
last
phrase
of
that
paragraph.
i'm
referring
to
roman
numeral
iv
on
page
16a.
the
last
phrase
reads,
i.e.,
martinez
and
de
leon...
"herein
are
third
party
beneficiaries
of
the
contract
between
guillermo
gallego
munoz
and
the
defendant
donald
courtney
mcdougal,
sr..
"
so
i
think
that
there
are
interwoven
interests
here
which
are
established
in
the
record
and
for
purposes
of
privity
those
relationships
should
suffice,
with
other
things.
now,
additionally,
these
respondents
actually
had
the
opportunity
to
intervene
in
the
state
court
litigation
and/or
participate,
and
in
fact,
respondent
munoz
did
participate
in
the
state
court
proceedings
and
he
argued
as
an
amicus
curiae
before
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
think
the
county
might
have,
but
the
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
is
conceivably
there
are
hundreds
of
people
who
might
have
been
named
parties;
namely--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--on
the
facts
of
this
case,
yes.
now,
the
other
major
issue,
i
think,
that
bears
on
the
privity
issue
is
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
the
same
piece
of
property
and
the
identical
rights.
the
respondents
have
not
applied
for
a
conditional
use
permit
themselves.
they
are
instead
simply
trying
to
challenge
the
export
restriction
in
mr.
mcdougal's
permit.
in
reading
professor
vestal's
law
review
article
in
the
iowa
law
review,
cited
in
my
brief,
he
talks
about
still
another
ground
for
binding
non-parties,
which
is,
i
suppose,
separate
and
apart
from
res
judicata
and
that
involves
a
situation
where
these
third
parties'
rights
are
derivative
of
the
party
to
the
lawsuit.
here
rights
to
sell
water
commercially
from
the
well
depend
on
the
issuance
of
a
permit
to
mcdougal.
respondents'
rights
to
purchase
from
mcdougal
for
export
are
necessarily
derivative
of
mcdougal's,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
there
is
not
a
zoning
ordinance
here
in
effect.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
vis-a-vis
use
permit,
i
think
that...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
underlying--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--i
rely
extensively
on
the
contractual
relationship
between
mcdougal
and
his
broker,
munoz.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
think
so.
going
to
the
anti-injunction
act--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--this
is
a
land
use
permit.
that
is,
we're
talking
about--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--right.
but
it
applies...
what
i
was
going
to
say
is,
it
applies
to
a
single
parcel
of
property.
there
is
no
county-wide
ordinance
which
restricts
the
application
of
water
or
any
other
product,
for
that
matter.
that's
indicated,
it
seems
to
me,
by
the
pleadings
which
indicate
the
respondents
can
go
eight
miles
north
and
purchase
water
from
a
well
there.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
if
there
were
a
county-wide
restriction
which
the
respondents
were
individually
affected
by,
i
would
certainly
believe
under
that
set
of
circumstances
they
could
have
standing
to
challenge
the
restriction.
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
is
hale
v.
bimco
for
the
proposition
that
third
party
strangers
are
not
barred
by
reason
of
a
state
court
adjudication
from
subsequently
challenging
in
the
federal
courts
a
statute
that's
arguably
unconstitutional.
if
the
county
had
an
ordinance
which
had
county-wide
application
preventing
export,
an
adjudication
against
mcdougal,
i
don't
think,
would
bind
third
party
strangers
separately
and
individually
affected
by
that
ordinance.
here,
though,
this
permit
rose
with
a
particular
parcel
of
land,
the
mcdougal
parcel.
i
think
that
under
all
of
the
circumstances
taken
into
consideration,
the
california
litigation
has
got
to
once
and
for
all
under
the
theory
underlying
res
judicata
adjudicate
the
rights
that
flow
from
that
piece
of
property.
were
the
county
to
purport
to
enact
an
ordinance
which
says,
no,
there
will
be
simply
no
export,
then
i
would
think
any
number
of
individuals
might
achieve
standing
to
challenge
it.
the
anti-injunction
act,
of
course,
prohibits
the
federal
court
from
granting
an
injunction
or
staying...
to
stay
proceedings
in
a
state
court
except
where
expressly
authorized
by
congress
or
when
necessary
to
aid
in
its
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
the
anti-injunction
act
did
not
have
application
because
there
were
no
proceedings
pending,
and
further
it,
relying
on
hale
v.
bimco,
indicated
that
if
there
were
proceedings
pending,
nothing
would
prevent
a
third
party
stranger
from
challenging
a
statute.
your
honors,
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
injunction
contemplates
ongoing
jurisdiction
in
the
court
and
inherent
authority
in
the
court
to
enforce
the
injunction.
as
subsequently
there
has
actually
been
a
contempt
proceeding,
a
contempt
judgment,
by
the
trial
court
judge
against
mcdougal
for
having
willfully
violated
the
terms
of
the
trial
court
injunction
as
affirmed
by
the
california
supreme
court.
i
therefore
think
that
the
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
likewise
violates
the
spirit
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
i
think
this
court's
recent
decision
in
vendo
is
analogous.
that
case
along
with
others...
hill
v.
martin...
make
it
clear
that
the
anti-injunction
act's
prohibition
is
broad
and
to
be
strictly
construed,
and
that
it
applies
to
any
stage
of
a
state
court's
proceeding,
from
the
time
of
final
judgment
through
enforcement.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
he
was
held
in
contempt.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
the
execution
of
the
judgment
was
stayed,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that's
correct;
execution
was.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
indicate
to
me
that
the
state
courts
have
deferred
making
a
determination,
as
for
example
was
the
case
in
hale
v.
bimco,
where
the
florida
state
supreme
court
before
ever
getting
to
final
judgment
said--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--the
state
court
was
aware,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
cross-contempt
proceedings
were
also
going
on
in
the
federal
district
court,
and--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--stayed
execution
of
the
contempt
judgment
against
mcdougal.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
the
injunction
or
the--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--the
injunction
against
mcdougal
is
clearly
a
final
judgment,
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
i
think
the
final
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
has
been
all
but
emasculated
by
the
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
the
superior
court.
--excuse
me;
the
district
court.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that's
right.
and
its
judgment
has
been
affirmed
by
the
california
supreme
court--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--the
superior
court,
your
honor,
has
shown
no
intention
to
set
aside
its
judgment;
to
the
contrary.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
except
insofar
as
it
has
withheld
execution
of
the
contempt
judgment
against
mcdougal
until
a
final
determination
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
directed
that
the
9th
circuit
should
determine
the
v.
oklahoma.
we
contend
that
there
is
no
export
question
before
the
court
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court,
based
as
it
was
on
estoppel,
furnished
an
independent,
adequate,
state
court
basis
for
the
judgment.
but
assuming
arguendo
that
there
is
some
standing
in
the
respondents,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
hughes
v.
oklahoma
should
not
have
application
because,
first
of
all,
hughes
v.
oklahoma
involved
a
direct
appeal
challenging
an
oklahoma
statute
to
this
court.
there
were
neither
res
judicata
nor
anti-injunction
action
issues
in
that
case.
finally,
we
have
cited
the
hudson
county
water
company
case
wherein
justice
holmes
upheld
a
new
jersey
statute
which
did
prevent
diversion
of
a
stream
from
outside
the
state
and
we
think
that
that
might
be
analogous
here.
if
the
court
were
to
ever
get
to
the
actual
issue
and
the
merits
of
the
export
restriction,
we
think
that
hudson
v.
hudson
county
water
presents
an
independent
ground
for
sustaining
an
export
restriction
situation.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
believe
not.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
wish
to
dispute
counsel's
assertion
that
he
has
pled
a
1983
action.
i've
reviewed
the
pleading
carefully.
i
only
find
one
reference
to
the
civil
rights
act,
and
that
starts
at
page
19.
that
cause
of
action
is
the
cause
of
action
pled
against
mcdougal,
as
i
read
it,
for
breach
of
contract.
there
is
no
reference
whatsoever
to
1983
as
a
possible
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act.
furthermore,
at
page
121
of
the
appendix
the
court
may
notice
that
a
notice
of
reliance
on
a
broader
claim
was
filed
by
the
respondents
here.
i
guess
that's
kind
of
an
amendment
to
the
pleading.
neither
was
1983
mentioned
in
that
notice
of
reliance
on
a
broader
claim.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
no,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
