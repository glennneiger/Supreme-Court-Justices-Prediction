mr.
harmon,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
some
new
person
in
mexico
who
formed
a
water
brokerage
business,
was
not
involved
previously
as
a
customer
of
this
well,
came
in
and
said,
i'd
like
to
attack
the
zoning
ordinance.
could
you
defeat
his
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
really
don't
rely
at
all
on
the
prior
relationship
between
the
mexican
broker
and
the
property
owner?
justice
stevens
but
you
said
the
same
argument
would
apply
to
someone
who
had
no
prior
contractual
relationship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kronberger,
could
i
return
for
a
moment
to
justice
stewart's
question?
supposing
instead
of
a
total
restriction
on
export,
there
had
been
a
restriction
on,
say,
you
can
only
pump
for
four
hours
a
day,
something
that's
on
a...
less
clearly
directed
at
a
person
in
your
capacity,
would
a
vendee
have
standing
to
come
in
before
the
county
and
challenge
that
kind
of
restriction
on
the
ground
that
if
he
produced
more
water,
maybe
i
could
buy
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
question
didn't
go
to
the
merits,
it
goes
to
standing,
whether
a
customer
of
the
property
owner
would
have
standing
to
say,
i
want
to
complain
about
this
because
it
affects
my
business?
it's
the
standing
question
that
i
think
we're
seeking
to
answer.
