justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
an
estoppel
judgment
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
res
judicata
argument
is
that
not
mr.
mcdougal
should
continue
to
be
bound
by
that
judgment
but
his
vendees--
justice
byron
r.
white
--should
also
be
bound
by
that
estoppel
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say
it
was
true,
but
still
the
estoppel
judgment
shouldn't
stand
against
these
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it
affirmed
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
harmon,
didn't...
weren't
those
other
issues,
though,
presented
in
the
state
litigation?
it's
just
that
the
state
court
didn't
decide
them.
they
were
presented
and
tendered,
and
the
state
court
decided
the
case
on
estoppel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit
said
it
wasn't.
so...
but
that
certainly
is
a
fair
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
mcdermott,
i
suppose,
at
least,
or
mcdougal,
or
whatever
his
name
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
have
named
him
a
party
to
your
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think...
that
bind
all
of
mcdougal's
customers
on
the
privity
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
isn't
a...
just
to
make
it
clear...
this
isn't
a
zoning
ordinance,
this
is
a
restriction
on
the
sale
of
water,
as
the
supreme
court
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
a
restriction
on
the
sale
of
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
mcdougal
held
in
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
the
judgment
was
stayed,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
depending
on
how
the
court
of
appeals
came
out,
it
was
stayed
permanently?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
so
what
does
that
mean
about
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
state
court
was
at
least
saying
as
to
mcdougal,
this
injunction
doesn't
mean
anything;
he
can
violate
it
if
he
wants
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they
stayed
it
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
mcdougal
won
this...
or
if
munoz
won
this
case
and
mcdougal
was
off
the
hook,
then
mcdougal
was
off
the
hook.
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
does
the
injunction
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
mcdougal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it's
been
rendered...
it
certainly
isn't
the
creature
that
it
was,
if
mcdougal
can
violate
it
at
will.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
superior
court
is
the
one
who
issued
the
injunction
in
the
beginning.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
keep
the
superior
court
from
setting
it
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
insofar
as
it
tells
mcdougal
he
doesn't
need
to
obey
it.
justice
white
--you
weren't
in
the
state
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
argue
the
anti-injunction
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
wonder
why...
the
federal
court's
judgment
did
do
away
with
the
state
court
injunction.
isn't
that
true?
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
it...
yes,
but,
the
injunction
was
lifted.
it
was
rendered
unenforceable
by
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
say
that
doesn't
violate
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
may
not
be
bound,
they
may
not...
perhaps
the
injunction
doesn't
apply
to
them,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
injunction
shouldn't
continue
to
apply
to
the
person
to
whom
it
applies,
namely,
mcdougal.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
at
least
clear
that
the
result
of
this
federal
judgment
is
that
the
state
court
injunction
is
unenforceable
against
mcdougal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
do
you
think
this
falls
under?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
diversity
jurisdiction.
if
you
really
mean
what
you
say,
you're
raising...
it's
a
federal
question
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what--
justice
white
--that's
what
the
anti-injunction
act
does
in
cases
to
which
it
applies,
that...
it
says
if
you
want
to
get
the
injunction
set
aside,
go
raise
your
federal
issues
in
the
state
court.
which
issued
the
injunction.
and
you
could
have
done
that,
you
know;
you
still
could.
justice
white
to
the,
to
the
superior
court
and
say--
--the
court
that
issued
the
injunction.
justice
white
what
did
the
superior
court,
how
did
the
superior
court
rule
on
your
claims
originally?
justice
white
well,
where
did
you
start...
did
you
start
the
case...
where
did
you
start
the
case?
justice
white
no,
no.
where
did
mcdougal
litigate?
justice
white
but
he
defended
on
constitutional
grounds,
didn't
he?
justice
white
so
the
views
of
the
state
superior
court
are
well
known?
justice
white
so,
if
you
went
to
the
state
court,
you
know
what
the
judgment
would
be
in
the
superior
court,
but
then
you
may
not
be
bound
in
the
state
supreme
court?
