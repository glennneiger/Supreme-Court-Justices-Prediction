justice
stewart
how
far
away
is
mexicali
from
this
well?
justice
stewart
so
it
would
be
more
than
twice
as
far
to
the
other
well?
justice
stewart
the
merits
are
not
really
before
this
court
in
this
posture
of
the
case,
are
they?
justice
stewart
would
there
be
any
question
of
the
standing
of
these
plaintiffs
to
bring
a
suit,
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
res
judicata?
justice
stewart
are
these
just
three
of
probably
thousands
if
not
millions
of
potential
buyers?
justice
stewart
well
we're
talking
about
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
justice
stewart
well,
could
anybody
who
lives
in
mexico
be
a
potential
plaintiff
in
this
suit?
justice
stewart
or
anybody
who
lives
in
canada?
justice
stewart
the
interest
would
be
i
want
to
buy
water,
or
i
may
want
to
buy
water
sometime.
justice
stewart
and
then
could
you
be
a
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court?
justice
stewart
well,
then,
anybody
who
alleges
that
he
now
wants
to
or
may
in
the
future
want
to
buy
water
is
a
potential
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court,
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
that
is,
anybody
who
does
not
live
in
the
united
states?
justice
stewart
or
does
not
live
in
the
imperial
valley,
rather,
in
this
county?
justice
stewart
that's
his
interest.
he
wouldn't
be
in
the
federal
court
if
he
weren't
interested.
justice
stewart
well,
the
commerce
clause
doesn't
by
its
terms
protect
any
activities,
it
just
gives
the
congress
of
the
united
states
the
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
or
international
commerce
or
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes,
period.
justice
stewart
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
persons
or
protections
or
anything
else.
justice
stewart
in
hughes
v.
oklahoma,
it
was
a
person
who
wanted
to
take
the
minnows
out
of
the
state
who
was
the
plaintiff,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
so,
in
other
words,
he
was
in
the
shoes
of
mcdougal
in
this
case?
justice
stewart
no,
no,
he
wasn't
the
purchaser.
he
was
a
person
who
wanted
to
take
the
minnows
out
of
the
state,
wasn't
he?
wasn't
that
hughes?
justice
stewart
did
you
say
earlier,
mr.
kronberger,
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
correctly,
that
you've
cast
your
lawsuit
as
a
1983
lawsuit?
justice
stewart
i
see
a
reference
here
to
1981.
justice
stewart
because
you
talked
about
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
mitchum
v.
foster.
justice
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
footnote
here?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
a
federal
statute
known
as
the
anti-injunction
act
provides
that,
and
i'm
quoting,
"a
court
of
the
united
states
may
not
grant
an
injunction
to
stay
proceedings
in
a
state
court
except
as
expressly
authorized
by
act
of
congress,
or
where
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
or
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments."
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
hold
that
the
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
give
sufficient
deference
to
that
statute.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice

while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court

filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
