justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
many
courts
disagree
with
the
9th
circuit's
rather
limited
definition
of
res
judicata
as
limited
to
issues
that
have
been
litigated
on
their
merits
and
say
that
it's
any
issue
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
estoppel
itself
a
substantive
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kronberger,
what
if
your
clients
had
litigated
the
precise
same
issue
that
you
say
they
are
now
seeking
to
litigate
here
in
the
federal
district
court
up
through
the
california
state
court
system,
saying
that
this
violates
the
federal
constitution,
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
ruled
against
them,
certiorari
denied
here.
would
you
say
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
start
all
over
again
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
open
the
door
to
mr.
mcdougal
to
just
find
somebody,
kind
of
a
straw
man
to
go
into
federal
district
court
and
relitigate
what
he's
a
already
lost
in
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kronberger,
let
me
get
back
to
your
definition
of
res
judicata.
supposing
in
the
california
state
court
litigation
mr.
mcdougal
thought
of
the
commerce
clause
argument
but
his
lawyer
told
him
that
this
just
is
too
much
of
a
long
shot
to
raise.
we
won't
bother
with
it
right
now.
and
the
thing
went
all
the
way
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
many
issues
were
decided
but
that
one
wasn't.
and
then
there
was
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
said,
no,
you're
too
late.
would
you
say
that
issue
is
not
res
judicata?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
hale,
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
florida
stay
all
further
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
pending
determination
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
supreme
court
of
california
never
said
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
the
highest
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
res
judicata
avoids
duplication
of
legal
proceedings
too,
does
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
did
mcdougal
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court?
