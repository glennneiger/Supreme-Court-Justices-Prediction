justice

marshall
mr.
levy,
do
you
see
anything
to
the
petition's
position
that
this
was
argued
as
a
one
conspiracy
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
if
congress
passed
the
bill
that
if
you
--
he
brought
a
gun
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
somebody
and
then
shot
somebody.
you
wouldn't
have
to
shoot
and
you
still
can
be
convicted
of
both
assault
and
purchase
of
the
gun.
i
guess
congress
could
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
