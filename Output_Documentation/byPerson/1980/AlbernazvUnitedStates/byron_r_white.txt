we're
going
to
make
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levy,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying
about
the
two-way
use
of
blockburger.
you're
saying
that
if
two
offenses
satisfy
the
blockburger
test
in
the
sense
that
each
requires
a
proof
of
the
fact
but
the
other
does
not,
then
one
should
presume
that
congress
had
intended
to
authorize
a
double
prosecution
and
double
punishment.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
permit
to
prosecute.
and
do
you
also
say
the
converse?that
if
there
are
two
offenses
that
do
not
each
--
are
--are
not
mutually
exclusive,
that
then
the
presumption
is
congress
intended
to
authorize
only
one
punishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
sort
--
what
--
what
would
rebut
such
a
presumption,
something
that
is
expressed
in
the
congress
and
even
though
it's
a
lesser
included
offense
we
want
to
be
p
--
multiple
punishment
to
be
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
it'd
be
a
very
clear
evidence
of
legislative
intent.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
simpson?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
were
these
on
924?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
levy,
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
opposition's
reliance
on
senator
dodd's
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
hand,
the
--
the
bill
that
came
over
from
the
administration
of
the
congress
had
merely
one
of
conspiracy
provision
that
it
didn't
deal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
isn't
it
surprising
that
therefore
to
end
up
were
two
penalties
that
there
isn't
something
positive
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
unless
congress
--
unless
congress
said
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you'd
say
--
say
that
satisfies
the
blockburger
test.
you
could
even
--
you
could
try
them
separately
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
but
i
--
but
i
say
if
they
if
--
if
each
requires
proof
of
a
--
of
a
fact
that
the
other
one
doesn't,
they
can
be
tried
separately,
can't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
double
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
question
would
it
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
question
would
it
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
different
offenses?
