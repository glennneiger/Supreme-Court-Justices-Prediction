ms.
judith
h.
mizner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
consecutive
sentences
can
be
imposed
for
separately
charged
violations
of
two
conspiracy
provisions
of
the
1970
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act,
where
those
two
provisions
were
violated
by
what
the
court
below
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
be
a
single
conspiracy
with
dual
objectives.
the
facts
were
briefly
that
following
the
seizure
of
a
large
quantity
of
marihuana
from
a
freighter
on
the
high
seas,
petitioners
albernaz
and
rodriguez
and
16
others
were
charged
in
a
two-count
indictment.
count
one,
charged
a
conspiracy
to
import
marihuana
in
violation
of
21
u.
s.
c.
section
963.
count
two,
charged
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
marihuana
in
violation
of
section
846.
now,
the
two
counts
were
absolutely
identical
as
to
the
alleged
conspirators,
the
alleged
time
and
locus
of
the
conspiracy,
and
the
overt
act
set
forth
in
furtherance
in
each
count.
they
differ
only
in
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
alleged
and
in
the
statutory
provision
that
was
allegedly
violated.
from
the
outset,
the
prosecution
triggered
the
two
statutory
violations
as
a
single
conspiracy.
stating
in
his
opening
that
the
conspiracy
charged
in
two
counts
is
actually
a
single
conspiracy,
that
at
all
times,
the
planning
was
the
same
to
go
find
someone
with
a
boat
with
reliable
people
to
go
out
to
sea
and
meet
the
freighter.
and
the
government's
evidence
focused
on
the
petitioners'
involvement
in
arranging
to
bring
the
marihuana
from
this
freighter
offshore
to
the
united
states.
however,
since
the
petitioners
had
enlisted
the
aid
of
drug
enforcement
administration
agents
to
provide
the
boat
to
transport
the
marihuana,
the
plan
never
came
to
fruition.
the
--
after
some
of
the
cargo
was
transferred,
the
coast
guard
moved
in
and
seized
the
freighter
and
the
petitioners
and
two
others
were
arrested
in
florida
later
that
day.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes
(voice
overlap)
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no,
they
were
charged
as
simply
a
conspiracy
to
import
and
a
separate
count
of
conspiracy
to
distribute.
but,
in
fact,
they
were
based
on
the
same
facts
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
and
the
court
would
have
found
a
single
conspiracy.
and
indeed
the
evidence
that
the
court
used
to
permit
the
finding
of
the
plan
to
distribute
was
evidence
that
was
also
relevant
to
the
plan
to
import
and
it
was
evidence
that
the
court
found
could
be
inferred
a
plan
to
distribute
but
not
a
separate
independent
distinct
conspiracy
to
distribute.
now
en
banc,
the
fifth
circuit
reaffirmed
this
finding
of
a
single
conspiracy
but
affirmed
the
imposition
of
the
consecutive
sentences
on
the
--
on
a
finding
of
congressional
intent
to
authorize
and
a
finding
that
there
was
no
double
jeopardy
involved
here.
now,
a
number
of
recent
opinions,
this
court
has
stated
that
in
determining
whether
multiple
punishment
for
separate
statutory
violations
that
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
are
permissible,
the
first
and
primary
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
authorize
such
punishment.
if
congress
didn't
intend
to
authorize
multiple
punishment,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
now,
the
congressional
intent
must
be
clear
and
unambiguous
because
criminal
statutes
must
be
strictly
construed
and
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
that
ambiguity
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
as
--
the
legislative
history
provides
an
affirmative
explanation
for
the
existence
of
the
two
separate
conspiracy
provisions
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
intent
to
impose
multiple
punishments
for
a
single
conspiracy
that
has
two
objectives
that
happened
to
fall
on
each
side
of
the
subchapter
line,
an
artificially
divided
subchapter
line.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no,
this
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent
of
using
the
legislative
history
to
support
--
to
show
that
there
is
no
affirmative
congressional
intent
to
impose
multiple
punishments
or
that
at
best,
it
is
so
ambiguous
that
the
rule
of
lenity
must
be
applied
to
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i
suggest
that
it
has
constitutional
overtones
in
terms
of
being
based
on
a
desire
not
to
impose
punishment
--
additional
punishment
unless
congress
has
spoken
clearly
and
unambiguously,
unless
congress
has
provided
fair
and
clear
adequate
warning,
which
an
adequate
warning
in
clarity
is
an
integral
part
of
due
process
of
law.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
excuse
me,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
but
this
goes
beyond
that
to
go
beyond
the
situation
where
a
statute
is
facially
void
for
vagueness
to
a
situation
where
it's
the
application
of
two
statutes
to
a
particular
factual
situation
rather
than
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well
--
i
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
it
goes
beyond
that
because
congress
may
well
have
not
intended
to
impose
multiple
punishments
where
two
statutes
that
under
a
strict
application
may
not
be
technically
the
same
offense
when
those
two
offenses
occur
in
the
same
criminal
episode
or
the
same
criminal
transaction,
congress
might
not
have
intended
multiple
punishment.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i
think
it's
--
it's
more
than
that
---
than
a
strict
application
of
two
offenses
or
one
offense
under
--
it
depends
how
you're
defining
that
equation.
the
government
has
argued
that
these
are
not
the
same
offenses
under
the
blockburger
test.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
but
then
it
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
that's
right.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
only
one.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
that
--
that
is
our
position.
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
and
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
that's
one
indicia
of
ambiguity.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
and
another
indicium
is
the
way
that
the
government
has
treated
prosecutions
that
involve
this
--
this
type
of
conspiracy
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
charging
them
both
in
one
count
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
and
in
two
counts.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i
believe
that
you
can
look
at
the
legislative
history
even
if
the
language
is
--
is
clear
on
its
face
but
i
believe
that
here
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no,
it's
--
it's
a
discretion,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
but
this
is
the
--
the
kind
of
case
we
are
talking
about
the
--
not
the
plain
meaning,
not
the
facial
clarity
of
the
words
themselves,
but
their
joint
and
simultaneous
application
to
a
particular
fact
context.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
we
don't
have
that
situation
here
because
the
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
in
that
case
i'll
suggest
that
if
it's
plain
to
some
and
not
to
others
then
there's
an
ambiguity
that
must
be
resolved
by
looking
at
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
the
legislative
history.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
that's
true.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes.
this
--
this
court
has
over
the
past
years
--
the
conspiracy
is
--
is
a
somewhat
unique
area
and
this
court
and
other
courts
have
drawn
lines
and
have
said
that
as
a
matter
of
history,
tradition
and
because
you
have
different
--
you're
penalizing
different
objectives,
you
can
punish
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense
because
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
is
to
punish
the
agreement
which
is
the
evil
rather
than
the
objective
which
forms
the
substantive
offense.
looking
at
the
legislative
history
in
this
case,
the
government
has
conceded
that
it's
silent
on
the
question
of
multiple
punishments.
i
suggest
it
goes
beyond
silence
and
provides
an
affirmative
explanation
for
the
existence
of
the
two
provisions.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
intent
to
impose
multiple
punishment
for
a
single
conspiracy.
as
proposed
to
the
congress
by
the
administrational
legislation
that
turned
out
to
be
the
1970
drug
act,
had
one
conspiracy
provision
that
penalized
all
offenses.
and
that's
the
way
it
went
through
the
senate
as
one
conspiracy
provision.
in
the
house,
because
of
the
intricacies
of
committee
jurisdiction
and
house
ways
and
means
desired
to
retain
control
over
import
and
export
provisions,
the
legislation
was
divided
between
that
committee
and
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
committee.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
i
think
that
what
it
suggests
is
a
division
according
to
whether
these
were
domestic
offenses
or
whether
they
were
internal
--
external
offenses
in
to
--
and
in
some
way
to
further
congressional
committee
jurisdiction.
if
you
look
at
section
801
of
the
act
which
sets
out
the
congressional
findings
as
to
what
are
the
social
dangers,
you
find
that
they
list
importation,
manufacture,
distribution,
possession
all
equally.
there
is
no
indication
that
importation
is
any
more
heinous
than
any
of
the
others.
yet
a
conspiracy
to
manufacture
and
distribute
is
punishable
under
one
conspiracy
provision,
846.
i
suggest
that
manufacture
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
importation.
it
puts
a
substance
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
--
that
is
an
affirmative
explanation
as
to
why
there
are
two
separate
provisions
as
opposed
to
the
one
that
is
proposed
by
the
administration
and
it
went
through
the
senate.
and
in
addition,
senator
dodd
in
--
said
that
he
perceived
no
major
difference
between
the
house
and
the
senate
legislation.
and
certainly,
if
you're
talking
about
the
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
right
i
notice
the
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
this
citation
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
is
missing.
and
it's
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
it
is
the
october
6,
1970
congressional
record
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
(voice
overlap)
--
page
numbers.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
certainly.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
shall.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
will
provide
that
tomorrow.
looking
at
the
--
at
the
statutory
structure,
as
well
as
the
legislative
history,
also
supports
a
conclusion
that
congress
didn't
really
intend
to
impose
multiple
punishment
for
a
single
conspiracy
because
of
the
--
the
possibility
that
a
conspiracy
with
two
objectives
that
fall
on
--
in
one
subchapter
are
penalized
only
under
on
statute,
for
example,
the
manufacture,
distribution
which
is
analogous
to
the
importation,
distribution.
and
there's
no
rational
basis
for
assuming
that
--
that
congress
would
intend
to
punish
those
two
types
of
conspiracies
differently.
and
the
government
has
conceded
in
its
brief
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i
suggest
that
because
of
the
interplay
of
two
factors,
one
of
which
is
the
unique
--
somewhat
unique
aspect
of
conspiracy
law
and
the
other
is
the
fact
that
importation
and
distribution
are
basically
two
integrally-related
and
almost
inseparable
offenses
in
most
circumstances
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
suggest
that
that's
a
very
rare
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
circumstance.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
and
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
it
is
a
crime
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
to
import
for
your
own
use.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
yes,
but
we're
talking
about
conspiracy
which
is
simply
the
agreement.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i'm
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there's
no
difference.
i'm
suggesting
that
--
that
they
are
kind
of
--
in
most
context,
very
interrelated.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
it's
--
it
would
be
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
oh
no,
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
substantive
offenses
cannot
be
made
separate
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
if
you
have
two
different
agreements
to
do
each
of
those
objectives,
you
couldn't
be
punished
separately.
i'm
saying
that
where
you
have
one
agreement
that
involves
both
of
those
objectives,
then
it
raises
questions
as
to
whether
this
is
the
place
where
the
court
should
draw
lines
as
it
has
done
in
other
areas
of
conspiracy
law
and
say
that
you
cannot
--
that
to
subdivide
a
single
agreement
with
two
very
closely
related
objectives
simply
means
some
fundamental
sense
does
constitute
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense
and
cannot
be
imposed
constantly
with
the
protections
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i'm
saying
that
--
that
conspiracy
is
kind
of
a
--
a
different
animal,
particularly
this
kind
of
conspiracy
where
you
don't
need,
under
the
drug
statute,
you
don't
even
need
an
overt
act.
it's
simply
a
crime
of
agreement.
if
--
if
you
sit
in
a
room
with
someone
and
agree
to
commit
an
offense,
you
are
punishable
at
that
stage.
let's
say
the
room
is
bugged
and
someone
--
some
law
enforcement
officer
overhears
you,
you're
punishable
at
that
stage
without
anything
more.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
i
--
i
suggest
that
where
one
agreement
has
two
objectives
particularly
the
two
objectives
of
importation
and
distribution
that
the
offense
is
fundamentally
singular
and
cannot
be
further
subdivided.
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
blockburger
test
to
the
--
to
a
determination
of
legislative
intent,
the
government
has
argued
that
any
ambiguity
that
exists
can
be
resolved
into
a
clear
congressional
intent
by
relying
on
the
blockburger
test.
and
i
suggest
that
it's
not
really
a
very
good
way
of
determining
legislative
intent.
in
a
number
of
recent
opinions,
this
court
has
not
looked
at
blockburger
in
determining
congressional
intent.
it's
a
way
of
telling
--
one
way
of
determining
whether
two
statutory
offenses
constitute
the
same
offense
but
it's
not
determinative
of
legislative
intent
because
well,
the
legislature
may
very
well
not
intend
to
impose
multiple
punishment
even
for
two
statutes
that
are
technically
distinct
under
this
test.
and
even
as
justice
rehnquist
noted
that
where
a
test
generally
comes
out
only
one
way,
it
is
particularly
not
a
good
tool
for
determining
legislative
intent
which
may
be
“yes”,
may
be
“no”
but
if
a
test
always
comes
out
one
way
it
--
it
really
says
nothing
about
what
the
legislature
intended.
and
additionally,
it
can't
be
a
presumptively
determinative
test
where
it
results
in
--
in
findings
of
separate
offenses.
what
it
means,
if
under
the
test,
you
find
that
two
statutory
violations
are
the
same
offense,
you
can
presume
there's
no
congressional
intent
to
multiple
punish
and
this
is
absence
of
clear
congressional
intent
to
the
contrary.
this
is
consistent
with
other
techniques
of
statutory
construction,
and
resolving
ambiguity
--
ambiguity
in
favor
of
the
defendant's
strict
construction.
but
it
only
works
one
way.
you
can't
simply
invert
it
to
say
that
where
you
have
two
statutory
violations
and
they're
not
the
same
offense,
you
have
a
presumption
of
an
intent
to
impose
multiple
punishment.
it's
like
saying
that
we've
got
a
fruit
that's
a
cherry.
you
presume
it's
not
yellow
and
then
you
invert
that
and
you
come
up
with
a
fruit
that's
not
a
cherry,
you
presume
it
is
yellow.
it
doesn't
work
logically.
you
cannot
just
simply
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i'm
--
you
can
--
i'm
saying
that
the
presumption
as
it
stands
is
in
accord
with
a
number
of
those
other
protections
afforded
to
a
defendant
such
as
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
specifically?
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
cannot
recall
any
--
any
specific
language
but
i
suggest
that
it
does
work
out
to
be
that
way.
and
in
whalen,
this
court
said
that
the
test
was
that
where
two
statutory
violations
are
the
same
offense,
you
presume
there's
no
congressional
intent
to
multiple
punish.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
the
prosecutor
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
may
have
the
power
to
prosecute
under
each.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i
suggest
that
where
you're
talking
about
two
offenses
that
are
violated
in
one
criminal
episode,
you
may
very
well
have
to
look
at
whether
congress
intended
--
if
the
crimes
are
related
in
some
sense
that
they
be
punished
consecutively.
not
that
you'll
not
be
tried
on
both
of
them
for
--
a
jury
may
very
well
find
you
did
one
and
not
the
other
or
that
you
did
both.
but
the
question
is
whether
you
can
be
consecutively
punished
for
both
of
those
offenses.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
consecutive
sentences
have
a
very
different
impact.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
on
the
occurrence
for
instance.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
i
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
you
have
to
give
the
trier
of
fact
the
opportunity
to
determine
which
of
those
two
offenses
if
they're
not
the
same
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
i'm
not
conceding
that.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i'm
saying
that
you
may
be
punished
only
once
for
that
offense.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
would
--
the
jury
may
come
back
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
judgment
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
should
be
imposed
on
only
one
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
right,
in
the
court
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
i
don't
believe
that
we
had
to
go
that
far.
we
were
simply
saying
that
judgment
should
be
imposed
on
only
one
and
that
sentence
should
be
imposed
on
only
one.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
even
though
the
jury
finds
two
separate
statutory
violations
that
are
in
fact
one
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
offense.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
and
bring
us
a
verdict
back
of
guilty
on
both
counts.
the
court
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
right,
the
court
can
only
impose
sentence
on
one.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
well,
it
doesn't
go
as
far.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
we've
got
--
i
did
respond
to
double
jeopardy
in
one
question
there
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
and
hopefully
respond
to
that.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
in
that
one
minute,
i
would
just
simply
like
to
say
that
we
do
contest
the
applicability
of
blockburger.
(a)
to
the
conspiracy
situation
in
general,
and
(b)
to
this
particular
conspiracy
situation
where
each
one
does
not
require
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
other
does
not,
since
you
can
infer
the
objective
of
distribution
from
the
same
facts
that
prove
the
importation.
i
would
suggest
that
american
tobacco
which
is
the
only
case
that
the
government
has
cited
as
a
prime,
this
is
distinguishable
on
the
grounds
that
-(a)
it
was
dicta.
the
portion
discussing
the
consecutive
sentences
for
section
1
and
2
violations,
and
two
that
sections
1
and
2
of
that
act
are
very
different
from
the
conspiracy
provisions
here.
section
one
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
i
trust
that
is
in
a
sense
almost
the
substantive
provision.
it
prohibits
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
makes
engaging
in
that
an
offense,
while
section
2
is
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
so,
there
might
be
different
reasons
for
saying
that
under
those
circumstances,
consecutive
sentences
might
be
permissible.
and
in
addition,
it
is
the
antitrust
act
which
this
court
has
recognized
and
commentators,
as
well,
has
not
been
construed
in
the
same
manner
that
normal
criminal
statutes
have.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no.
i'm
saying
that
the
antitrust
statute
has
been
given
a
much
broader
construction,
a
looser
construction
in
terms
of
effectuating
its
--
its
goal
as
a
pro-competitive
free
enterprise
statute
and
this
--
this
court
has,
i
believe,
in
united
states
gypsum
recognized
that
it
has
not
construed
the
sherman
antitrust
act
and
other
antitrust
act
in
the
same
manner
that
it
can
construes
penal
statutes
such
as
the
drug
statute.
that
it's
given
a
much
broader
construction.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
no,
i'm
suggesting
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
what
on
--
no,
it's
not
a
--
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
--
question
of
which
is
more
offensive
to
society.
it's
a
question
of
this
court's
having
throughout
its
history,
construe
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
differently.
and
in
addition,
at
the
time
of
american
tobacco,
these
were
misdemeanor
offenses.
the
--
the
civil
sanctions
were
much
more
compelling
than
the
criminal
misdemeanor
penalty.
so
i'm
just
saying
that
relying
on
that
decision
to,
as
a
general
proposition,
that
blockburger
has
been
applied
to
other
criminal
conspiracy
context
is
inappropriate.
ms.
judith
h.
mizner
thank
you.
