mr.
mark
i.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act
of
1970
was
designed
as
this
court
recognized
in
united
states
versus
moore
to
strengthen
existing
law
enforcement
authority
in
the
field
of
drug
abuse.
the
act
contains
two
distinct
conspiracy
provisions
in
two
distinct
subchapters.
one
provision,
section
963,
proscribes
conspiracy
to
import
a
controlled
substance
and
it
authorizes
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
or
a
fine
that
does
not
exceed
the
penalty
specified
for
the
abject
offense
of
importation.
the
other
provision,
section
846,
proscribes
conspiracy
to
distribute
a
controlled
--
a
controlled
substance
and
it
authorizes
a
sentence
measured
in
terms
of
the
abject
offense
of
distribution.
thus,
a
conspiracy
having
multiple
objectives
both
to
import
and
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance
implicates
both
subchapters,
each
of
which
authorizes
a
sentence
based
on
the
punishment
provided
for
the
underlying
substantive
offense.
notwithstanding,
the
existence
of
distinct
subchapters
with
distinct
offense
and
penalty
provisions,
petitioners
contend
that
a
conspiracy
involving
importation
and
distribution
of
a
controlled
substance
in
violation
of
section
963
and
section
846
can
be
punished
under
only
one
of
these
provisions
but
not
both.
surely
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
structure
of
the
drug
control
act
implies
such
a
result.
to
the
contrary,
the
act
on
its
face
suggests
that
sections
846
and
963
establish
separate
offenses
that
are
subject
to
cumulative
penalties.
moreover,
our
interpretation
is
also
supported
by
the
blockburger
rule.
as
recently
his
last
term
in
whalen,
the
court
stated
that
blockburger
is
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
that
has
been
consistently
relied
on
to
determine
whether
congress
has
in
a
given
situation,
provided
that
two
statutory
offenses
may
be
punished
cumulatively.
similarly,
in
iannelli,
the
court
said
that
blockburger
serves
the
function
of
identifying
congressional
intent
to
impose
separate
sentences
--
separate
sanctions
--
excuse
me
--
for
multiple
offenses
arising
in
the
course
of
a
single
act
or
transaction.
unquestionably,
the
blockburger
test
is
satisfied
here.
conspiracy
to
import
a
controlled
substance
in
violation
of
section
963
and
conspiracy
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance
in
violation
of
section
846,
each
requires
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
other
does
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
one
would
assume
or
presume
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
blockburger
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
they
look
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
it
looks
in
both
directions.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
agree.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
question
on
the
first
part
of
the
case
is
whether
the
statutes
authorize
consecutive
sentences
which
we
submit
is
resolved
in
the
first
instance
by
application
of
the
blockburger
rule.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
the
blockburger
rule
in
that
terminology
is
the
means
to
determine
whether
they
are
separate
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
offenses
or
the
same
offense.
but
we
think
it
is
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
believe
not.
it's
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
will
only
take
issue
with
the
characterization
of
whether
they
are
separate
or
the
same
offenses.
we
think
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
authorizes
consecutive
sentences
rather
than
whether
in
any
abstract
sense
these
could
be
characterized
as
the
same
or
different.
but
if
that
is
the
--
the
correct
terminology
then
we
think
blockburger
supplies
the
means.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right.
and
we
submit
that
blockburger
works
in
both
directions
in
that
terminology.
we
think
that's
expressed
in
--
in
the
court's
recent
decisions,
its
understanding
of
the
blockburger
rule
in
whalen
and
iannelli
and
we
think
that
that's
absolutely
supported
by
the
court's
decisions
in
the
harris
case,
the
gore
case,
and
the
blockburger
case
itself
in
which
the
court
relied
on
the
rule
to
hold
that
consecutive
sentences
were
permissible.
so
we
think
the
court
has
already
answered
the
question
in
how
the
blockburger
works
in
both
directions
as
mr.
justice
white
put
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
certainly.
i
--
i
hope
to
get
to
that
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
by
the
end
of
my
argument
but
we
think
we
agree
with
petitioners
in
the
sense
that
the
first
issue
in
the
case
for
the
court
to
resolve
is
whether
the
statutes
authorize
the
consecutive
sentences.
we
submit
they
do
and
therefore,
the
double
jeopardy
question
will
be
presented
here.
but
we
agree
that
that's
the
first
issue
that
the
court
should
pass
upon.
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
to
my
opposing
counsel,
we
think
this
case
is
not
like
simpson
and
busic.
first,
after
whalen,
it's
not
completely
clear
to
us
that
the
blockburger
rule
applies
to
the
type
of
compound
and
predicate
offenses
that
were
at
issue
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
question
in
the
end
was
the
same,
whether
the
statutes
authorize
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
consecutive
sentences
in
simpson.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
that
sense,
we
agree
with
you
but
we
think
the
analysis
of
the
particular
case
here
is
much
different
than
the
one
the
court
employed
in
those
cases.
in
particular,
the
court
in
--
in
simpson
and
busic
did
not
employ
the
blockburger
test
and
certainly
didn't
find
that
the
test
was
--
was
met
by
the
statutes
at
issue
there.
and
the
court
certainly
did
not
suggest
that
if
blockburger
had
been
met,
that
it
would
not
have
given
some
guidance,
indeed
a
presumptive
guidance
on
the
intent
of
congress
to
authorize
consecutive
sentences.
moreover,
in
those
cases,
as
the
court
found
affirmative
evidence,
particularly
the
statement
of
congressman
poff,
from
the
rejection
of
the
dominick
amendment,
affirmative
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
that
consecutive
sentences
were
not
intended
by
congress.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
do,
with
the
emphasis
on
the
word
presumption.
it's
a
rebuttable
presumption
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
based
on
a
specific
legislative
history
and
statute
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
would
be
one
illustration,
for
example.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
right.
i
would
cite
just
as
an
illustration
the
gun
control
act,
section
924(c)
that
makes
it
clear
in
terms
that
the
sentences
to
be
imposed
in
addition
to
the
sentence
for
the
underlying
federal
felony.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
it's
not
because
simpson
involved
only
a
discrete
class
of
felony
as
to
contain
their
own
enhancement
of
provisions.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
it
did.
and
either
the
assault
statute
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
or
bank
robbery
statute.
yes,
they
were
the
same.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly.
even
though
that
might
not
pass
the
blockburger
rule
because
one
is
a
lesser
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
included
offense
than
the
other.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly.
and
that's
one
illustration
of
--
of
evidence
that
would
really
rebut
the
inference
that
arises
from
blockburger.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
our
principal
reliance
here
and
we
think
that's
--
that's
the
first
rule
that
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
should
be
applied
in
any
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
they
pass
the
blockburger
test,
that's
correct
and
we
think
there's
no
doubt
here
that
they
do
and
petitioners
do
not
contend
otherwise.
so
that's
not
an
issue
that's
contested
in
this
court.
petitioners
do
contend,
however,
that
the
blockburger
rule
is
inapplicable
to
conspiracy
offenses.
however,
nothing
in
the
formulation
or
the
rationale
of
the
rule
indicates
in
any
way
the
conspiracy
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
rule.
moreover,
in
the
american
tobacco
case,
this
court
specifically
applied
the
blockburger
test
to
hold
that
a
single
conspiratorial
agreement
to
violate
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
was
subject
to
cumulative
penalties.
here,
analogously
to
american
tobacco,
conspiracy
to
import
a
controlled
substance
and
conspiracy
to
distribute
that
substance
are
separate
statutory
offenses
under
sections
943
and
846.
and
the
blockburger
rule
indicates
that
these
distinct
statutory
conspiracies
are
reciprocally
distinguishable
from
and
independent
of
each
other.
braverman
versus
united
states,
upon
which
petitioners
heavily
rely
in
their
brief,
does
not
compel
a
different
result.
the
court
in
braverman
construed
the
general
conspiracy
statute
not
to
authorize
multiple
convictions
for
a
single
agreement
to
commit
several
unlawful
acts.
the
braverman
decision
itself
makes
clear
as
do
the
subsequent
decisions
in
pinkerton
and
american
tobacco,
but
braverman
is
confined
to
a
situation
in
which
the
conspiracy
is
alleged
to
violate
but
a
single
statute
and
in
particular,
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
in
contrast,
here,
as
in
american
tobacco,
the
conspiracy
to
accomplish
multiple
illegal
objectives
violates
two
distinct
statutes
each
of
which
provides
for
a
separate
penalty.
finally,
our
analysis
under
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
we
don't
take
the
position
here
and
we
think
that
question
would
raise
different
and
more
difficult
questions
that
are
presented
in
that
case.
there
would
be,
i
think,
two
levels
of
inquiry
involving
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
one
would
be
whether
congress
intended
to
preempt
the
general
conspiracy
statute
by
enacting
specific
conspiracy
statutes,
and
if
it
didn't,
and
whether
the
conspiracy
statute
would
satisfy
the
blockburger
test
and
whether
the
court's
decision
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
in
braverman
would
require
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
lower
courts
consistently,
as
far
as
i
know,
had
held
that
they
do
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
certainly
one
possible
analysis
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
will
say
that
the
overt
act
is
something
of
--
of
an
unusual
element
in
--
in
the
normal
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
one
could
also
satisfy
the
blockburger
test,
simply,
without
reference
to
the
overt
act
requirement.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
other
words,
if
congress
didn't
--
if
--
if
congress
intended
the
general
conspiracy
statute
to
remain
applicable
where
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
not
subject
to
a
specific
conspiracy
provision,
then
we
think
that
even
without
reference
to
the
overt
act
requirement
would
also
satisfy
the
blockburger
test.
but
i
emphasize
that
the
question
of
--
of
the
relationship
between
371
and
the
specific
conspiracy
of
provisions
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
the
court
would
look
among
other
things
to
the
specific
history
and
provisions
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--
at
issue
and
determine
the
question
of
congressional
intent,
but
that
problem
is
not
here
today.
our
analysis
under
blockburger
and
american
tobacco
is
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
sections
846
and
963
are
directed
at
separate
evils.
in
particular,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun,
averted
to
the
same
idea
before.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
importation
of
a
controlled
substance
not
only
poses
a
societal
harm
relating
to
drug
trafficking
and
the
increased
availability
of
the
illegal
drugs,
but
it
also
involves
a
breach
of
the
sovereign
borders
of
the
united
states
and
an
interference
with
the
government's
authority
to
regulate
commerce
across
those
borders.
a
wrong
that
occurs
independently
of
either
the
contraband
nature
of
the
items
brought
into
the
country
or
the
subsequent
use
or
distribution
that
is
made
of
them.
thus,
since
section
846
and
963
serve
to
protect
against
different
social
dangers,
a
separate
penalty
for
the
violation
of
each
provision
is
justified.
petitioners
offer
two
arguments,
to
rebut
the
blockburger
presumption
in
this
case.
first,
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
drug
control
act
does
not
disclose
a
clear
intention
to
allow
cumulative
penalties
for
a
single
unlawful
agreement,
and
second,
that
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
the
construction
that
consecutive
sentences
are
not
permitted.
it
is
common
ground
between
petitioners
and
ourselves
that
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
the
precise
question
of
consecutive
sentences
for
conspiracy
to
import
and
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance.
however,
it
is
unrealistic
to
demand
as
petitioners
do,
that
congress
focus
its
attention
on
every
conceivable
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
and
furnish
and
express
an
unambiguous
answer
to
every
potential
question
that
might
subsequently
be
litigated.
as
recently
noted
in
the
whalen
opinion,
both
this
court
and
the
congress
have
recognized
that
the
legislative
process
simply
does
not
function
in
the
manner
envisioned
by
petitioners.
since
congress
is
predominantly
a
lawyer's
body,
that
is
presumably
aware
of
familiar
legal
doctrines,
it
must
be
assumed
to
be
cognizant
of
the
subtle
blockburger
rule
and
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
contrary
indication
to
contemplate
the
consecutive
sentences
may
be
imposed
in
cases
such
as
the
instant
one
where
two
distinct
statutory
provisions
meet
the
blockburger
test.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
we
have
a
citation
on
our
brief
to
a
similar
statement
by
a
--
by
a
representative
saying
that
the
bill
that
was
enacted
was
essentially
the
house
version
rather
than
a
senate
version
and
i
think
that's
supported
by
the
conference
report.
but
the
honest
answer,
i
think,
is
that
congress
never
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
consecutive
sentences
and
therefore
it
was
never
confronted
in
an
immediate
way
with
any
difference
that
might
exist
between
the
house
version
and
the
senate
version
in
that
regard.
the
congress
did
enact
this
--
the
house
version.
it
did
enact
the
statute
that
has
two
distinct
conspiracy
provisions
that
meet
the
blockburger
rule.
and
we
think
in
no
circumstances
consecutive
sentences
are
authorized.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
that
--
that,
i
think,
poses
the
question
in
this
case
rather
than
answers
it.
if
there
have
been
two
separate
conspiracies
in
the
sense
that
i
believe
you
are
using
the
term,
justice
marshall,
then,
unquestionably,
there
could
be
consecutive
sentences.
there
could
be
consecutive
sentences
for
two
violations
of
the
same
statute
if
there
were
two
separate
agreements.
the
problem
only
arises
where
as
a
factual
matter
the
unlawful
agreement
is
--
is
singular
rather
than
plural
on
its
--
on
that
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
legal
question
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
the
question
is
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
it
could,
because
there
are
two
separate
evils
and
congress
has
the
right
particularly
in
an
area
like
gun
control
to
an
absent
of
sentences,
stiff
provisions.
petitioners
contend
that
the
existence
of
two
conspiracy
provisions
is
purely
adventitious
and
merely
reflects
the
fortuity.
the
two
different
committees
considered
the
bill
on
the
house.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
however,
the
history
they
emphasize
is
not
inconsistent
with
and
does
not
foreclose
consecutive
sentences
pursuant
to
sections
846
and
963.
rather
than
ineluctably
conforming
petitioners'
construction,
this
history
is
equally
consistent,
we
believe,
with
the
inference
of
the
house
committees
focusing
on
two
distinct
governmental
interests
concluded
that
a
conspiracy
encompassing
importation
and
distribution
comprise
dual
evils
that
should
be
subject
to
enhance
penalties.
more
specifically,
the
legislative
development
of
the
act
is
fully
compatible
with
the
view
that
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
which
has
general
jurisdiction
over
customs
and
import
matters
deemed
importation
offenses
to
present,
not
only
a
drug
problem,
but
also
a
discrete
harm
involving
the
territorial
sovereignty
of
the
nation
and
the
government's
ability
to
control
ingress
from
foreign
shores.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
one
would
hope
that
congress
would
address
the
question.
otherwise,
it'd
certainly
be
simpler
if
it
had
but
i
don't
think
particularly
as
this
court
noted
around.
i
don't
think
it's
surprising
that
there
is
no
discussion
of
this
in
the
act.
congress
rarely
specifically
and
expressly
indicates
its
intent
to
allow
consecutive
sentences.
congress
did
enact
the
bill
that
has
two
separate
conspiracy
provisions.
those
provisions
do
pass
the
blockburger
test.
in
those
circumstances,
the
question
is
whether
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
defeats
the
presumption
flowing
from
blockburger.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
and
particularly
the
events
in
the
house
that
petitioners
so
heavily
rely
on
are
fully
consistent
with
the
position
we
take
here
in
the
resolution
suggested
by
blockburger.
the
bills
that
were
originally
introduced
in
the
two
committees
were
substantively
identical
and
each
applied
to
both
domestic
and
international
drug
offenses,
the
only
difference
between
the
bills
concerning
the
type
of
drugs
covered.
the
ways
and
means
bill
was
applicable
to
narcotics
and
marihuana
which
historically
have
been
regulated
under
the
internal
revenue
code
and
other
statutes
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
committee.
while
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
committee
bill
was
limited
to
depressant
and
stimulant
drugs
which
previously
had
been
regulated
under
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
thus,
was
--
was
within
the
authority
of
the
commerce
committee.
later,
however,
and
importantly,
this
division
of
responsibilities
was
deliberately
altered
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
ways
and
means
committee,
which
as
i
noted
before,
has
general
jurisdiction
over
customs
and
import
matters,
focused
its
attention
on
the
international
aspects
of
the
bill.
at
the
same
time,
the
commerce
committee
addressed
the
domestic
side
of
the
bill.
thus,
the
ultimate
relationship
between
the
committees
expressly
and
purposely
emphasized
the
distinction
between
the
domestic
and
international
facets
of
the
legislation.
in
these
circumstances,
we
believe
that
it
accords
with
the
usual
presumption
of
rationality
and
regularity
of
congressional
actions
and
is
not
contradicted
by
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
believe
that
the
ways
and
means
committee
was
naturally
aware
of
and
concerned
with,
not
only
the
particular
menace
of
drug
--
drug
trafficking
but
also
with
the
government's
general
interest
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
its
borders
and
in
policing
its
boundaries
against
unauthorized
entries
into
the
united
states.
from
the
outset,
the
legislation
in
the
house
consisted
of
two
bills,
each
containing
its
own
conspiracy
provision
and
congress
in
passing
the
comprehensive
drug
control
act
was
unquestionably
aware
of
the
separate
conspiracy
sections.
accordingly,
the
most
likely
congressional
understanding
was
that
under
the
well
established
blockburger
doctrine,
cumulative
penalties
would
be
available
for
the
distinct
conspiracy
offenses
defined
in
sections
846
and
963.
at
the
least
it
cannot
be
unfailingly
supposed,
as
petitioners
suggest,
that
the
existence
of
separate
conspiracy
provisions
was
a
mere
accident
of
the
legislative
process
and
that
congress
never
intended
to
authorize
consecutive
sentences.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
now,
i
think
one
would
have
to
follow
a
different
analysis
and
i
--
i
believe
that
--
that
braverman
likely
would
--
would
certainly
be
highly
illuminating
if
not
controlling
in
those
circumstances.
it
is
conceivable,
however,
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
some
other
way,
congress
would
indicate
an
intent
to
authorize
consecutive
sentences,
and
that
situation
by
analogy
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
right.
but
that
situation
arose,
for
example,
in
the
callanan
case
where
the
hobbs
act
in
a
single
section
proscribes
both
conspiracy
and
substantive
offenses.
and
this
court
held
that
even
though
there
was
but
a
single
provision,
both
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense
could
be
cumulatively
punished.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
my
assumption
is
that
one
could
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
essentially
the
analysis
that
was
followed
in
braverman,
but
that
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly,
but
absent
and
some
specific
indication
i
think
the
--
the
strong
inference
would
be
that
the
single
conspiracy
provision
could
only
give
rise
to
one
sentence.
petitioners'
second
argument
to
rebut
the
blockburger
rule,
the
rule
of
lenity
analysis,
is
also
unavailing.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
such
cases
as
busic
and
in
callanan,
the
notion
of
lenity
is
one
guy
to
be
used
in
discerning
legislative
intent
where
an
ambiguity
otherwise
is
present.
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
writing
for
the
court
in
callanan,
the
rule
is
a
guide
to
statutory
construction
and
comes
into
operation
at
the
end
of
the
process
of
construing
what
congress
has
intended
not
at
the
beginning
as
an
overriding
consideration
of
being
lenient
to
wrongdoers.
in
our
view,
the
blockburger
doctrine
renders
it
unnecessary
to
resort
to
the
rule
of
lenity.
if
as
in
this
case,
two
distinct
statutory
provisions
satisfy
the
blockburger
test,
it
is
to
be
presumed
the
defenses
under
those
provisions
are
subject
to
cumulative
penalties.
indeed,
the
very
purpose
of
the
blockburger
standard
was
to
answer
the
question
of
consecutive
sentences
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
indication
of
congressional
intent,
and
therefore,
blockburger
serves
to
resolve
any
ambiguity
that
might
otherwise
call
for
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity.
lenity
cannot,
by
itself,
be
used
to
defeat
the
blockburger
doctrine
and
we
are
unaware
of
any
decision
in
which
this
court
has
found
the
blockburger
test
to
be
satisfied
and
yet
nonetheless
relied
on
the
rule
of
lenity
to
prohibit
the
imposition
of
cumulative
penalties.
petitioners'
counsel
also
relied
on
the
fact
that
there
are
divergent
authorities
among
court
of
--
the
courts
of
appeals
on
the
proper
construction
of
these
conspiracy
provisions.
we
don't
think
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
not
sure.
you
mean
try
them
in
separate
prosecutions?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that
raises
an
entirely
distinct
question.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
statute
would
allow
them
to
be
tried
separately.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
would
be
an
additional
question,
one
that
isn't
present
here,
where
there
are
successive
prosecutions.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
whether
successive
prosecutions
rather
than
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
that
would
be
the
question
whether
the
offenses
are
the
same
or
different
offenses,
and
even
if
they
were
different
offenses
as
the
court
held,
for
example,
in
harris
versus
oklahoma
and
in
re
nielsen.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
might
still
bar
successive
prosecutions.
that
would
rest,
i
suppose,
on
some
notion
of
finality
for
the
defendant's
benefit
of
an
interest
that
simply
is
not
presented
in
the
context
of
multiple
punishments
following
a
single
trial
and
a
single
sentencing
proceeding.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
the
court
has
on
occasion
indicated
that
blockburger
has
some
--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
deny
that
for
many
years
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
might
still
have
some
relevance
although,
as
the
court
well
knows
from
our
brief
in
whalen,
we
believe
that
the
double
jeopardy
issue
in
that
context
is
no
different
from
the
question
of
whether
the
legislature
has
authorized
multiple
punishments.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
did
not.
the
blockburger
case
itself
was
a
--
a
question
of
statutory
construction
as
were
the
succeeding
cases
in
gore
and
in
harris
among
others.
petitioners'
counsel
seeks
to
find
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute
because
courts
of
appeals
have
diverged
on
a
proper
construction
of
the
conspiracy
provisions.
i
would
only
point
out,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
suggested
that
virtually,
every
--
every
federal
criminal
case
heard
by
this
court
involves
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
including
those
cases
in
which
the
court
applies
--
finds
that
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
plain
on
its
face
or
declines
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity,
and
i
would
cite
to
the
court
as
illustrations
to
the
lewis
case
in
445
u.s.,
the
colbert
decision
in
435
u.s.,
and
the
scarborough
decision
in
431
u.s.
moreover,
since
the
rule
of
lenity
is
merely
a
device
to
ascertain
congressional
intent,
it
is
not
applicable,
we
believe,
whereas
in
a
drug
area,
congress
intends
to
deal
severely
with
serious
criminal
violations
like
those
of
petitioners.
in
gore,
this
court
declined
to
extend
the
rule
of
lenity
to
federal
drug
laws
because
congress
had
manifested
an
attitude,
not
of
lenity
but
of
severity
toward
such
offenses.
as
the
court
recognized
in
moore,
congress
did
not
follow
a
different
course
in
enacting
the
drug
control
act
of
1970.
if
as
we
urge,
the
court
concludes
that
sections
846
and
963
authorize
consecutive
sentences,
the
imposition
of
such
sentences
on
petitioners
does
not
contravene
a
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
first,
it
is
our
belief
that
the
court
in
its
recent
decision
in
whalen
did
adapt
the
view
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
consecutive
sentences
that
are
authorized
by
the
legislature
and
impose
that
a
single
sentencing
proceeding
following
a
single
trial.
since
congress
did
authorize
cumulative
punishments
here,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
no
more
offended
that
if
--
than
if
congress
had
enacted
an
equivalent
statute
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
mentioned
which
expressly
provided
a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
for
conspiracy
both
to
import
and
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance
and
five
years
for
conspiracy
to
engage
in
only
one
of
the
proscribed
objectives.
but
in
any
event,
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
multiple
punishments
authorized
by
congress
could
be
unconstitutional
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
petitioners'
sentences
in
this
case
would
nonetheless,
be
in
fact,
valid.
to
the
extent
that
the
clause
is
applicable
here
at
all,
the
blockburger
test
would,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
furnish
the
standard
for
determining
whether
separately
defined
crimes
constitute
the
same
offense
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
and
i
think
that
is
the
phrasing
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
before.
here,
these
statutes
clearly
satisfy
the
blockburger
test
as
we
discussed
previously.
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy,
this
case
is
no
different
from
one
in
which,
for
example,
the
defendants
conspire
to
import
goods
without
paying
the
customs
duty
in
order
to
obtain
an
unfair
competitive
advantage
and
attain
a
monopoly.
surely,
such
an
unlawful
agreement
could
be
punished
if
congress
saw
fit
as
a
violation
of
both
the
smuggling
and
antitrust
laws.
contrary
to
petitioners'
basic
premise,
nothing
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
forbids
congress
to
conclude
that
an
agreement
to
commit
two
offenses
is
more
pernicious
and
should
be
more
severely
punished
than
an
agreement
to
commit
one
offense.
thank
you.
