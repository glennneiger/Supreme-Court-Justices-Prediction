ms.
mizner,
the
hypothesis
for
the
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity
has
to
be
that
it's
ambiguous
whether
a
course
of
conduct
constitutes
one
offense
or
two.
there
has
to
be
uncertainty
about
that
particular
problem,
doesn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
if
--
and
if
there
is
uncertainty,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
requires
that
a
court
find
that
the
intent
was
to
--
impose
only
one
punishment,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
exactly.
and
the
rule
of
lenity
has
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
an
absolute
prohibition
and
the
rule
of
lenity
simply
says
that
when
it's
not
clear
that
two
offenses
were
intended,
then
it
shall
be
presumed
that
there
is
only
one,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
they're
not
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unless
congress
--
if
it's
not
clear
that
congress
intended
that
two
separate
punishments
be
imposed
then
regardless
of
any
blockburger
test
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
the
rule
of
lenity
says
only
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
should
be
imposed.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
that
is
the
rule
of
lenity,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
its
hypothesis
is
that
there
be
an
ambiguity
as
to
whether
one
or
two
punishments
are
to
be
imposed.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
there's
an
obvious
ambiguity
here
because
the
--
the
court
said
or
construed
it'll
come
out
in
different
ways.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
one
--
one
clear
indicium
of
--
of
ambiguity.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
your
further
argument
was,
going
back
a
little
further,
you
can
be
convicted
of
only
one
or
am
i
might
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
be
tried
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
both.
justice
potter
stewart
both.
but
the
jury
must
be
instructed
that
the
conviction
must
be
only
one
conviction
and
on
either
alternatively.
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
jury
finds
a
violation
of
two
separate
criminal
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
and
brings
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
verdict
of
convictions,
two
convictions.
justice
potter
stewart
on
each
of
two
counts?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
the
first
inquiry
if
--
if
it
were
before
the
court
would
be,
do
these
specific
conspiracy
statutes
displace
the
general
conspiracy
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
but
apart
from
many
blockburger
test.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
