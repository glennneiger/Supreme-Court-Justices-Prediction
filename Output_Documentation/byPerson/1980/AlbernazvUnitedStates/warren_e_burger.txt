chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
submitted.
we'll
resume
at
1:00
with
albernaz
against
united
states.
ms.
mizner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
rule
of
lenity
a
discretionary
concept
or
how
would
you
describe
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
we
begin
to
think
about
turning
our
minds
to
the
rule
of
lenity
and
about
the
same
situation
that
we
turned
to
the
legislative
history
if
we
find
ambiguity
in
the
statute
but
not
otherwise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
can
but
do
we?
do
--
is
there
a
rule
that
we
look
to
the
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
statute
is
clear.
isn't
it
that
the
plain
meaning
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
language
of
the
statue,
to
go
back
to
justice
stewart's
discussion
with
you,
if
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
is
apparent,
do
we
look
either
to
the
legislative
history
or
have
you
given
any
thought
about
the
rule
of
lenity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
we
had
it.
i
just
said
“if”
--
if
it's
plain,
because
it
might
be
plain
to
someone
and
not
be
plain
to
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
ones
who
do
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
people
who
think
it's
plain
would
--
are
not
likely
to
agree
that
there's
an
ambiguity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
saying
that
might
be
one
indicia
of
ambiguity,
but
here
--
but
here
we
have
more
than
that.
we
have
statutes
that
on
their
face
say
nothing
about
how
they
are
to
be
applied
in
the
context
of
a
single
conspiracy
that's
charged
as
violating
both
provisions.
it's
--
it's
like
the
situation
in
whalen
and
busic
and
simpson
and
jeffers
where
there
are
two
separate
statutes
that
are
not
void
for
vagueness,
but
in
terms
of
how
they
are
to
be
applied
in
a
particular
factual
context
where
there's
a
single
criminal
episode,
then
there
is
some
ambiguity
that
must
be
resolved
by
looking
at
legislative
intent
and
other
tools
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
that
--
you
say
there's
a
single
criminal
episode,
a
person
may
be
convicted,
therefore
a
conspiracy
without
norm,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
if
the
conspiracy
is
executed
that's
a
separate
crime,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
the
person
was
importing
for
his
own
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
rare
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
uncommon?
is
it
a
crime
to
import
for
your
own
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
sell
some
to
some
other
people.
that's
a
crime,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
your
thought
that
--
that
there
is
no
difference
between
importing
for
your
own
personal
use
and
importing
for
a
distribution
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
they're
related.
you
don't
--
if
you're
going
to
distribute
it,
you've
got
to
import
it
in
some
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
not
suggesting
they
can't
be
made
two
separate
crimes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
you
have
just
one
moment
remaining,
one
minute
remaining
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
you.
do
you
mean
that
this
society's
view
is
that
it
is
not
as
serious
to
commit
antitrust
violations
as
it
is
to
import
drugs
or
vice
versa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
was
--
which
is
the
more
offensive
to
society?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
there
is
no
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
california
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
albernaz
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
rehnquist.
