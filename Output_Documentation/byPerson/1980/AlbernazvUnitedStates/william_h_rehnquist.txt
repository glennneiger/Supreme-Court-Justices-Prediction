justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
have
going
for
you
here
besides
the
rule
of
lenity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
not
be
an
argument
that
relies
on
the
braverman
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
you
don't
impose
punishment
initially.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
impose
punishment
initially
unless
congress
has
spoken
clearly
and
ambiguously.
so
there's
nothing
different
in
the
second
sentence
from
the
--
from
the
first
sentence
in
that
sense.
if
--
if
congress
has
--
has
laid
down
the
standard
like
in
lanzetta
where
it's
difficult
to
figure
out
what
it
means,
you
apply
the
rule
of
lenity
and
say,
“we
just
don't
know
what
it
means
and
therefore,
we
won't
convict.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
contending
then
that
out
of
the
93
judicial
districts
in
the
united
states,
if
you
can
find
one
district
judge
to
say
that
it's
ambiguous,
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
because
we
have
one
judge
saying
it's
ambiguous
even
though
92
others
say
it's
not
ambiguous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
would
really
require
a
metaphysical
approach
to
the
thing
as
it
--
that
there
is
only
a
certain
atom
or
that
you
can't
split
atoms
of
crime,
something
to
that
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
don't
claim
that
--
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
that
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
--
i
don't
entirely
follow
that.
you
--
you
act
as
if
the
criminal
justice
system
that
we
have
carried
over
from
our
english
system
is
a
totally
logical
one
that
a
--
a,
if
there
is
a
balance
on
one
side,
there
is
a
balance
on
another.
now,
the
defendant
has
a
number
of
--
per
the
presumption
of
innocence,
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
things
going
from
--
why
can't
you
invert
the
presumption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
said
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
--
that's
the
way
we
try
to
talk.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
--
that
will
be
in
effect
then.
the
doctrine
of
my
brother
brennan's
same
transaction
test,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
blockburger
anyway,
did
not
originate
as
a
constitutional
doctrine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
anti-criminal
--
anti-drug
statutes
are
to
be
construed
much
more
strictly
than
drug
statutes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
untied
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
entered
into
a
single
conspiracy
that
is
an
agreement
among
themselves
which
envisioned
both
the
importation
and
the
distribution
of
marijuana.
their
conspiracy
was
foiled
by
law
enforcement
officers
and
they
were
subsequently
charged
and
convicted
on
a
two-count
indictment
of
conspiracy
to
import
marijuana
in
violation
of
one
statute
in
conspiracy
to
distribute
marijuana
in
violation
of
another.
they
received
consecutive
sentences
for
each
count.
petitioners
don't
contend
that
their
conspiracy
to
import
and
distribute
marijuana
did
not
violate
both
of
these
statutes.
instead
they
argue
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
authorize
multiple
punishments
for
violations
of
these
two
statutes
in
a
case
involving
only
a
single
agreement
or
conspiracy.
they
also
argued
that
even
if
congress
intended
consecutive
sentences
to
be
imposed,
imposition
of
such
of
a
punishment
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
hold
today
that
congress
did
intend
to
impose
multiple
punishments
for
violation
of
these
two
conspiracy
statutes
even
in
a
case
involving
only
a
single
agreement
or
conspiracy.
the
provisions
of
the
statute
are
unambiguous
on
their
face
and
each
authorizes
punishment
for
a
violation
of
its
terms.
moreover
we
have
historically
applied
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
announced
in
the
well-known
blockburger
case
to
determine
congressional
intent
in
this
area.
the
statutory
provisions
here
clearly
satisfy
that
rule.
finally,
we
hold
that
imposition
of
consecutive
sentences
in
this
situation
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
where
consecutive
sentences
are
imposed
to
the
single
criminal
trial,
the
role
of
a
constitutional
guarantee
and
limiting
is
limited
to
assuring
that
the
court
does
not
exceed
it's
legislative
authorization
by
imposition
of
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offenses.
the
question
of
what
punishments
are
constitutionally
permissible
is
not
different
from
the
question
of
what
punishment
the
legislative
branch
intended
to
impose.
where
congress
intended
as
it
did
here
to
impose
multiple
punishment
imposition
of
such
sentence
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
affirmed.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result
in
this
case
in
which
justice
marshall
and
justice
stevens
joined.
