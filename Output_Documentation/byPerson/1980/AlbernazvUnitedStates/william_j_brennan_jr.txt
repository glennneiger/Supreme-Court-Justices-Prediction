justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
conspiracies
here
are
conspiracy
to
import
and
conspiracy
to
distribute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
about
simple
possession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
inquiry
pretty
much
the
same
as
in
simpson
and
busic?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
confess
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
one-way
argument.
seems
to
be
everytime
you've
got
two
different
offenses,
defined
either
in
two
different
statutes
or
two
sections
in
one
statute,
the
presumption
is
that
the
prosecutor
has
the
power
to
prosecute
under
either
one,
the
second
or
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
up
to
the
prosecutor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
need
affirmative
evidence
of
an
intent
to
allow
him
to
do
it
other
than
the
fact
that
the
congress
passed
two
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
why
is
it
different
from
say
speeding
and
throwing
a
bomb
out
the
window
but
he
does
it
in
one
transaction?
you
don't
have
to
find
congress
specifically
thought
about
these
two
crimes
being
committed
at
the
same
time
and
one
of
them,
multiple
punishment.
you
just
violate
two
laws.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
they
--
if
they
punish
them
for
both
but
they've
imposed
concurrent
sentences?
you're
nevertheless
convicting
them
and
punishing
them
for
both
offenses.
so
what
--
what
difference
would
it
make
if
they're
consecutive
or
concurrent?
if
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
can
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
but
--
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
there
for
--
for
your
purposes,
i
would
think
you
would
say
you
couldn't
be
tried
on
both
of
them
at
once
and/or
at
least
you
would
--
certainly
wouldn't
think
that
the
judge
could
say
5
to
10
years
on
each
count
to
run
concurrently.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
should
just
pick
one
or
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you
can
--
seem
to
concede
that
he
could
impose
punishments
for
both
as
long
as
he
made
them
concurrent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you're
just
--
so
far,
i
just
heard
you
argue
statutory
construction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
--
what
if
it
were
not
the
case?
then
under
blockburger
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
you
would
assume
absent
some
clear
indication
of
the
contrary
that
congress
didn't
intend
double
punishment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
been
the
rule.
at
least
that's
the
--
the
way
--
that's
the
direction
blockburger
looks
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
other
cases,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
looks
the
other
way,
if
they're
different
punishments.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
--
so,
a
part
of
this
case
is
whether
these
are
the
same
or
different
offenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
--
that's
on
the
assumption
that
if
they're
separate
offenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
your
colleague
agrees
with
that
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
a
part
of
this
case,
is
i
suggest,
again,
is
whether
--
whether
these
are
separate
or
the
same
offenses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'll
put
it
the
other
way
then.
part
of
this
case
is
--
is
deciding
in
which
direction
--
which
--
which
direction
do
we
follow
blockburger
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'd
suppose
you'd
--
i
--
i
suppose
that
even
if
it
were
decided
that
these
were
the
same
offenses,
if
they
--
if
they
were
tried
together
and
the
sentences
--
consecutive
sentences
imposed
in
the
same
proceeding,
the
government
would
suggest
that
there's
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
think
my
question
was,
wasn't
it,
whether
or
not
the
same
inquiries
that
were
made
in
simpson
and
busic
and
whalen
had
to
be
made
to
resolve
a
question
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that's
all
i
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levy,
do
i
correctly
understanding
that
it
--
if
this
statute
in
section
1
it
said,
“importing
is
bad”
and
section
2
said,
“distribution
is
bad.”
and
section
3
said,
“a
conspiracy
to
do
any
of
the
forgoing
is
bad”,
you'd
proscribe
the
other
way.
because
if
you
had
one
conspiracy,
one
prohibition
against
conspiracies,
then
you'd
have
to
follow
braverman,
if
you
had
two
separate
conspiracy
prohibitions,
do
you
follow
blockburger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you
didn't
have
anything
beside
the
face
of
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
my
question
is
whether
you
could
punish
the
conspiracy
twice
because
it
had
two
separate
objects
in
that
situation
i
gave
you.
i
think
you'd
say
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
because
there's
only
one
prohibition
against
the
conspiracy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
i
recognize
your
stressing
the
use
of
blockburger
as
a
statutory
construction
aid,
you
don't
deny
that
it
has
some
relevance
to
the
constitutional
inquiry,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
a
lot
of
the
stuff
for
many
years,
that
was
the
constitutional
standard.
i
--
you
don't
deny
that,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
it
might
still
be
--
have
some
relevance
to
the
constitutional
question.
