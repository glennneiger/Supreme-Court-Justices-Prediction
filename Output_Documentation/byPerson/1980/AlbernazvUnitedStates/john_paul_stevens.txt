now,
was
there
an
enhancement
provision
would
clearly
be
the
evidence
of
an
intent
to
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
but
that
would
be
clear
on
the
face
of
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
--
in
this
case,
you
rely
basically
just
on
the
blockburger
rule
itself
for
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
know,
still,
that
depends
on
your
being
able
to
convince
us
or
somebody
that
these
are
separate
offenses
in
the
blockburger
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
under
your
argument
that
these
people
could
have
been
prosecuted
for
three
crimes
under
one
conspiracy
because
i
suppose
they
also
violated
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
these
statutes
require
proof
on
an
overt
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas,
rather
--
the
general
conspiracy
statute
does
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
blockburger
test
would
allow
all
three
because
that's
an
effect
that
you
must
prove
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
would
not
have
to
prove
under
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
an
element
of
the
--
of
the
general
conspiracy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
