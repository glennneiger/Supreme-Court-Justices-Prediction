but
doesn't
that
in
itself
suggest
that
the
house
perceived
that
importation
and
distribution
pose
distinct
social
evils?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
would
explain
it
in
a
way
than
purely
on
a
committee
structure
of
the
house
of
representatives?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
could
i
--
i
interrupt
you
at
that
point?
do
you
have
a
copy
or
brief
in
front
of
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
turn
to
page
19.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
reference
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
indeed
it
is
and
i'd
like
you
to
give
it
to
me.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
can
do
it
afterward
but
i'd
like
you
to
if
you
would
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
write
a
letter
to
the
clerk
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
to
give
us
that
specific
citation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'll
confess
--
i
tried
to
find
it
in
the
cursory
examination
and
i
would
like
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.
mizner,
let
--
let
me
pose
a
hypothetical.
suppose
there
were
a
statute
that
a
conspiracy
to
import
and
distribute
shall
be
punished
twice
as
severely
as
a
conspiracy
to
do
either
one
alone,
would
that
in
your
estimation
be
violative
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
i
did.
