mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
court
upheld
a
health
standard
promulgated
by
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration,
and
the
standard
specifies
the
maximum
amount
of
respirable
cotton
dust
that
may
be
in
the
air
of
any
textile
plant.
it
is
intended
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
byssinosis,
which
is
a
respiratory
condition
associated
with
cotton
dust.
petitioner
in
one
case
are...
american
textile
manufacturers
association
or
atmi,
a
trade
association,
and
12
manufacturer
members.
petitioners
in
the
other
case
are
the
national
cotton
council,
which
represents
all
seven
segments
of
the
cotton
industry
from
farmers
to
textile
manufacturing.
the
standard
is
extraordinarily
severe
and
costly;
it
requires
textile
manufacturers
to
reduce
cotton
dust
within
four
years
to.2
milligrams
per
cubic
meter
of
air
in
all
yarn
manufacturing
processes
and
to.75
milligrams
per
cubic
meter
in
all
weaving
processes.
now
this
standard
was
arrived
at
by
osha
by
applying
their
carcinogen
policy,
which
this
court
remembers
from
benzene.
the
benzene
case
requires
that
the
exposure
limit
be
set
at
the
lowest
feasible
level.
it
is
ironic
that
just
two
days
ago
osha
rescinded
its
carcinogen
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
in
a
variety
of
ways,
justice
rehnquist.
in
the
first
place,
my
first
point
will
be
that,
to
find
a
standard
economically
feasible,
osha
must
have
an
estimate
of
costs
which
is
based
upon
substantial
evidence.
it
must
then
find
what
those
costs
mean
to
the
industry,
what
impact
it
will
have
upon
the
industry;
how
many
jobs,
how
much
investment
will
be
lost
because
of
that
cost.
and
finally,
it
has
to
have
a
legal
criteria
by
which
it
is
able
to
state
that
the
impact
it
finds
is
economically
feasible.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
from
the
congressional
language
and
also
it
seems
to
me,
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
something
is
feasible
without
knowing
what
it
will
do
to
the
industry.
and
osha
has
made
no
finding
here
of
what
it
will
do
to
the
industry
other
than
to
say
that
some
undefined
number
of
plants
may
close.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
industry
as
such,
justice
stewart,
will
not
cease
to
exist
is
all
they
have
said.
that
finding
is
thoroughly
consistent
with
90
percent
of
the
industry
being
left,
or
50
percent
of
the
industry
being
left,
or
10
percent
of
the
industry
being
left.
in
fact,
the
literal
language
that
osha
uses
would
be
satisfied
if
there
were
a
single
mil
left.
that
standard
of
the
industry
will
continue
to
exist
is
not
a
standard
at
all.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
the
only
one,
that's
right,
justice
stewart.
and
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
that
standard,
if
that
is
considered
to
be
a
standard,
means
that
nobody
knows
what
osha
is
doing;
judicial
review
is
impossible,
and
you
have
the
completely
uncanalized
power
over
industry
that
this
court
found
improper
on
the
benefit
side
of
the
act.
here,
they
are
claiming
the
same
power
through
their
power
to
impose
costs
without
limit,
or
without
any
real
limit.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
trust
so.
because--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i'm
suggesting
that,
but
i
have
additional
suggestions,
justice
white--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--monday.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it's
in
the
federal
register
as
of
monday,
is
it
not?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
just
learned
about
it
last
night.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
mean
that
it
would
be
proper
to
do
it
that
way?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
would
agree
that
the
congress
does
have
the
power
to
do
that.
there
may
be
problems
about
compensation,
but
i
think
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
however,
one
thing
is
clear;
that
congress
in
the
osha
act
did
not
intend
just
to
shut
down
industries,
because
they
required
that
the
standard
be
economically
feasible.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
an
additional
problem
arises,
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
congress
did
not
delegate
the
power
to
destroy
an
industry
because
it
specifically
required
that
economic
feasibility
be
present.
so
while
congress
may
have
the
raw
constitutional
power
to
do
that,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
in
this
statute
it
has
not
done
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct,
justice
white.
but
it
is
more
than
that,
because
it
is
a
constitutional
point
in
that
sense.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
it
is
also
a
statutory
point,
so
that--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
think
those
persons
who
do
not
think
that
the
delegation
doctrine
remains
a
part
of
constitutional
law
would
nevertheless
wish
to
reverse
here,
for
a
wholly
inadequate
set
of
findings
about
economic
feasibility.
one
simply
cannot
judge
economic
feasibility
in
any
way
from
the
record
osha
has
made.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
everybody
who
has
looked
at
it,
every
court
who
has
looked
at
it
has
accepted
the
contention
that
feasibility
requires
both
technological
feasibility
and
economic
feasibility.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
perhaps
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
they
do...
no,
osha
does
not
contend
that
economic
feasibility
is
not
a
requirement.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
why
i
find
it
ironic
that
osha
continues
to
insist
upon
a
standard
arrived
upon
the
carcinogen
policy
for
cotton
dust
which
is
not
a
carcinogen.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--it
was
certainly
identical,
not
just
comparable,
justice
stevens.
and
i
think
they
expressly
relied
upon
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
lead
case
is...
the
carcinogen
policy
was
amended
because
of
the
benzene
case,
and
they
said
that
the...
that
lowest,
that
carcinogen
policy
requiring
the
lowest
feasible
level
was
inconsistent
with
the
act.
i
would
suppose
this
is
too.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
it
is
not
a
carcinogen.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don't
think
the...
i'll
come
to
that,
i
don't
think
the
significant
risk--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that
first
finding
was,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
there
is
a
significant
risk
in
cotton
dust,
it's
a
question
of
at
what
level
and
with
what
controls
that
risk
disappears,
is
very
much
before
us.
but
my
first
point
i
have,...
really
want
to
argue
two
propositions.
the
first
one
is
economic
feasibility.
and
as
to
that,
my
point
is
that
three
things
are
required.
as
i
said,
an
estimate
of
costs
based
upon
substantial
evidence.
our
point
here
is
that
the
estimate
of
costs
is
based
upon
no
evidence,
it
is
pure
conjecture.
but
the
second
two
elements
of
economic
feasibility
aren't
even
present
here,
and
that
is,
what
do
those
costs
mean
for
the
industry,
how
much
of
this
industry
is
going
to
be
destroyed.
that
isn't
even
addressed
here,
except
to
say
the
whole
industry
won't
be
destroyed.
and
thirdly,
there
is
no
criteria
of
any
sort;
no
policy
judgment,
no
articulated
policy
judgment,
nothing
as
to
why
whatever
percentage
of
the
industry
is
going
to
be
destroyed
should
nevertheless
be
considered
a
feasible
policy.
so
that,
two
of
the
three
elements
which
are
inherent
and
inevitable
in
any
finding
of
economic
feasibility
simply
aren't
present
here,
and
that
fact
alone,
i
think,
requires
reversal.
additionally,
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
cost
for
the
bases,
so
that
we
have
economic
feasibility
requiring
three
elements,
not
one
of
which
is
present
in
this
case.
and
the
government's
brief
i
think,
quite
understandably,
attempts
to
obscure
this
point
which
is
present
in
our
main
brief,
by
speaking
as
if
we
are
only
arguing
about
the
substantial
evidence
supporting
the
cost
estimate.
we
are
not
only
arguing
that.
we
are
also
arguing
that
the
other
two
elements
which
are
required
for
any
sensible
judgment
of
economic
feasibility
aren't
even
addressed
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
my
second
proposition,
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
these--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
think
it's
under
both,
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
under
both
sections
of
the
statute.
but
i
want
to
stress
that
these
two
propositions
are
logically
independent.
the
argument
about
economic
feasibility
would
in
and
of
itself
justify
reversal,
quite
aside
from
whether
there
was
any
requirement,
which
we
contend
there
is,
that
there
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
costs
and
benefits.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
of
appeals,
the
cost-benefit
point
was
presented
and
the
finding
of
economic
feasibility
was
attacked,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
think
it
was
that
drawn
out,
in
quite
that
sharp
a
form.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
accepted
the
idea
that
if...
which
was
challenged...
that
if
the
whole
industry
was
not
destroyed,
that
was
sufficient.
the
court
of
appeals
articulated
that
standing.
but
i
think
therefore,
under
the
economic
feasibility
point,
that
the
agency
is
claiming
an
unfettered
power--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
in
the
first
place,
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
advancing
any
standard
because
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
do
so.
these
things
have
never
been
addressed--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--oh,
i
think
it
means
both.
for
example,
if...
it
may
be
that
if
there
is
a
section
of
the
country
where
all
of
the
firms
would
be
destroyed
with
drastic
effects
upon
employment
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
that
might
be
considered
not
feasible,
even
though
the
production
would
shift
to
a
different
section
of
the
country.
but
i
don't
really
wish
to
settle
that.
we
haven't...
this
is
a
process
of
developing
this
law
which
has
not
even
been
gone
through
by
osha.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it's
just
not
there.
and
i
am
really
not
prepared
to
spell
out
all
of
the
conditions
under
which--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that's
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
that's
true.
i
think
the...
while
we're
talking
about
practical
concerns
and
so
forth...
i
think
it
would
be
a
common
law
development
when
osha
began
to
give
the
reasons
why
it
found
a
certain
level
of
destruction
feasible.
the
courts
could
then
look
at
it
and
we
would
begin
to
get
some
rationality
into
osha's
processes
and
we
would
know
what
they
were
doing.
and
not
least,
that
would
make
osha
politically
accountable
to
congress,
because
congress
would
know
then
what
price
we
are
paying
for
this
kind
of
thing.
so
i
think
it
is
a
large
function
of
this
court
to
introduce
political
accountability
into
processes,
governmental
processes,
which
lack
them.
and
this
one
certainly
lacks
them.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
my
opinion,
you
have
chosen
the
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
pains
me
a
great
deal,
but
i
think
they
could.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
answer
is
yes
they
could,
if
they
told
the
agency
what
it
was
to
consider
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
whether
or
not
cigarettes
were
to
be
banned.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so,
if
it's
a
canalized,
structured
delegation,
so
the
commission
isn't
just
roaming
free.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
congress
would
not
be,
nor
would
osha,
if
they
had
been
delegated
the
task.
but
they
were
delegated
the
task
to
do
it
to
the
extent
that
it
is
feasible,
which
we
all,
i
think
agree
that
it
means
economically
feasible,
and
given
that,
i
think
they
have
to
make
the
findings
that
go
to
feasibility.
and
they
have
not.
now
the
other
point--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--justice
powell,
the
difficulty
is
that
osha
has
never
addressed
what
it's
authority
is.
i
think...
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--osha's
findings
are
simply
that
the
entire
industry
will
not
be
destroyed
or
industry
as
a
whole
will
not
be
destroyed,
that's
all
they
said.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
osha
could
still
claim,
under
that
form
of
words.
i
don't
know
what
osha
would
do
in
that
case.
and
a
large
part
of
osha's
argument
in
its
brief
is
that
they
don't
really
need
to
state
a
standard
because
they
are
very
reasonable
and
prudent
people.
and
in
effect,
the
brief
argues,
you
can
certainly
trust
us
because
we're
reasonable
and
we're
careful.
but
that's
the--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
can't
find
them,
justice
powell.
i
think
it's
an
extraordinarily
vague
performance.
we
don't
know
what
they
mean
about
feasibility,
which
is
my
entire
point.
the...
they
did
say,
that
some
marginal
plants
will
close
rather
than
comply.
one,
if
marginal
means
plants
that
are
close
to
the
edge
financially,
that
could
be
a
very
large
part
of
the
industry.
we
don't
know.
some
plants
will
close
rather
than
comply,
other
plants
may
go
out
of
business
after
they
try
to
comply.
osha
simply
has
not
addressed
that
issue.
in
a
way,
i
think
they
have
to,
to
have
a
rational
process
that
can
be
reviewed
by
anybody.
the
only
thing
they
have
tried
to
do,
is
state
that
they
have
found
particular
costs.
i
think
i
will
have
to
provide
that
subject
in
view
of
the
time,
because
if
a
careful
look
is
taken
at
their
cost
estimates
it
will
be
found
that
they
rest
upon
nothing.
for
example,
in
the
spinning
process,
which
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
to
deal
with
in
terms
of
getting
dust
levels
down,
it
turns
out
that
their
own
contractor,
rti,
found
553
million
dollars
to
get
down
to
the.2
level
osha
insists
upon,
and
said
that
local
exhaust
would
be
necessary;
local
exhaust
ventilation.
now
it
turns
out,
you
can't
put
local
exhaust
ventilation
on
spinning
frames,
and
the
experts
hocutt
and
thomas,
who
were
our
dust
control
experts,
said
it
couldn't
get
down
to.2
under
any
circumstances.
osha
did
two
things:
it
made
up
its
own
technology,
both
experts
agreed,
you
had
to
do
it
by
local
exhaust
ventilation.
osha
just
decided
no,
you
can
do
it
some
other
way;
we
don't
know
how
they
think
we
can
do
it,
except
they
speak
vaguely
about
room
ventilation,
which
the
people
agree
won't
work.
they
also
made
up
their
own
cost
figures.
they
rejected
their
own
contractors'
cost
figures
by
about
500
million
dollars,
so
that
we...
the
one
thing
we
do
know
about
the
cost
that
osha
projects
is
that
they
have
no
relationship
to
the
real
costs.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
not,
your
honor.
they
may
be
used
by
some
people,
but
not
by
others,
and
in
cases
where
they
may
not
be
used,
cannot
be
used,
then
transferred
to
a--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--as
i
understand
it,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
now--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well
for
some
people,
the
standard
sizes
don't
fit.
some
people
have
a
little
trouble
breathing
through
them,
other
people
can
use
them.
so
you
have
to
try
it
on
the
individual
and
see
whether
he
is
one
who
can
use
it.
one
more
point
about
costs
which
is
simply
that,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
less
cotton
is
going
to
be
manufactured
as
a
result
of
this
standard.
in
fact,
the
cotton
production
has
been
dropping
every
year
since
the
standard
was
announced.
and
osha
decided
it
did
not
have
to
look
at
the
costs
imposed,
for
example,
upon
cotton
farmers;
there
are
160,000
cotton
farmers
many
of
whom
are
no
longer
going
to
growing
cotton
and
osha
just
simply
ignored
all
of
those
costs
in
its
standard
and
didn't
even
address
them.
which,
i
think,
is
also
improper.
but
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
second
proposition
now,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
costs
and
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
national
cotton...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
national
cotton
council
put
in
the
evidence
on
what
would
happen
to
cotton
farmers,
it
put
in
the
evidence
upon
the
decline
of
domestic
cotton
production
which
i
think
is
about
2.5
percent
a
year
for
the
last
four
years,
and
of
course,
the
import
of
domestic,
foreign
textiles,
cotton-made
textiles,
has
been
increasing
and
may
increase
at
6
to
7
percent
a
year,
even
under
the
restrictive
trade
agreements.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nothing
that
i
can
think
of,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
how
would
we
effect
it?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
addressed
your
question
on
the
assumption
that
congress
has
the
raw
power
to
try
it.
i
don't
think
it's
a
very
practical
effort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
would,
it
would.
but
on
the
relationship
between
cost
and
benefit,
i
think
this
is
an
ideal
case
to
consider
it,
because--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--it's
entirely
different.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
justice
brennan,
i
think
it
is
what
we
all
do
every
day,
and
in
about
every
decision
we
make.
and
osha
has
been
doing
cost
benefit
analysis
when
they
chose
to
go
after
cotton
dust
before
noise,
when
they
chose
a.2
level
and
chose
a.75
level
for
other
processes,
they
did
it
because
they--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--we
define
benefit
in
what
additional
worker
health
protection
will
be
provided
by
the--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
that's
not
a
benefit,
unless
it
provides
additional
protection
to
workers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right,
and
here
i
think
the
real
case
to
be
decided...
the
reason
i
think
this
is
a
case
that's
almost
ideal
for
this
kind
of
discussion,
is
that
byssinosis
is
not
a
carcinogen,
it
develops
slowly,
it
can
be
caught
by
a
variety
of
tests
long
before
it
gets
to
the
irreversible
stage,
so
that
i
think
there
is
no
benefit,
but
i
don't
have
to
say
that...
i
think
there's
no
benefit,
to
reducing
the
pel
from.5
to.2
when
you
have
a
medical
surveillance
plan
which
catches
these
things
and
the
workers
can
be
transferred
or
put
in
respirators.
but
at
least
osha
should
have
addressed
the
question,
whether
moving
from...
down
from.5
to.2....5
is
a
reduction
in
dust
levels,
i
mean,
that's
our
proposal,
whether
coming
down
from.5
to.2
with
a
medical
surveillance
plan
which
osha
itself
has
said
these
tests
would
insure
that
any
significant
change
from
the
baseline
determination
will
become
apparent
before
material
impairment
occurs.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
this
comes
under
the
reasonably
necessary
language,
and
under
the
requirement
of
feasibility,
and
indeed,
it
comes
i
think
from
the
language
that
osha's
counsel
seem
to
think
goes
the
other
way,
which
is
no
material
impairment
of
health
to
the
extent
feasible.
that
isn't
a
standard
about,
that
isn't
a
criteria
about
a
single
health
hazard,
that
is
the
worker
and
the
total
amount
of
risks
he
faces
in
the
marketplace,
and
you
can't
come
close
or
as
close
as
is
possible--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--justice
brennan,
i
would
stress
that
i'm
not
suggesting
a
computer
or
a
slide
rule
and
a
straight
weighing.
i
think
osha
should
be
allowed...
required,
is
required
to
state
what
range
it
is
dealing
with
in
cost-benefits--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--in
the
sense
that
you
want
osha
to
articulate
the...
because
they
have
never
done
it,
the
additional
benefits
from.5
with
medical
surveillance
to.2
with
medical
surveillance,
and
i
think
there
are
no
additional
benefits.
but
they've
never
articulated
it
if
there
are
any.
and
i
don't
think
this
is
reading
something
into
the
statute
in
any
heroic
fashion,
justice
brennan,
because
this
is
a
less
heroic
reading
of
the
statute
than,
for
example,
reading
the
rule
of
reason
was
into
the
sherman
act,
whose
text
simply
doesn't
allow
the
rule
of
reason.
but
in
order
to
make
that
a
rational
and
useful
statute,
rather
than
a
wholly
destructive
statute,
this
court
read
the
rule
of
reason
in
it.
so,
here,
i
think
the
text
of
this
statute
easily
allows
and
indeed,
compels
the
finding
that...
and
i
want
to
stress
this,
osha
says
in
its
brief,
that
it
is
comparing
all
these
factors.
so
it's
not
resisting
thinking
about
cost-benefit.
on
page
57,
they
give
you
a
list
of
all
the
cost-benefit
analyses
they
do,
what
they
are
resisting
is
disclosing
their
thought
processes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
so
that
anybody,
justice
marshall,
can
review
it,
or
find
out
what
they're
talking
about,
or
so
that
congress
can
find
out
what
they're
talking
about
and
what
kind
of--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--certainly,
justice
stevens.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
stress
that
human
life
is
not
at
stake
in
this
case,
because
at
the
levels
we're
talking
about
and
the
medical
surveillance
we're
talking
about,
this
stuff
can
be
caught
before
it
becomes
irreversible
and
human
life
is
not
at
stake
in
this
case,
nor
is
material
impairment
of
health
at
stake
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
and
not
in
most
cases,
i
think.
not
a
dollar
value.
but...
and
nobody
expects
that.
we
expect
them
to
state...
we
expect
the
following
benefits,
they're
going
to
cost
so
much,
and
that
seems
to
us
reasonable--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--but
we're
not
asking,
justice
stevens,
that
they
come
up
and
say,
look,
the
benefits
in
dollars
outweigh
the
costs
in
dollars.
what
we
want
is
an
articulation
of
what
they
expect
to
get
for
how
much
money,
and
over
time,
they
will
develop
a
common
law
and
courts
will
begin
to
understand
what--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--it
is
judgmental.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
that
is
correct,
absolutely
correct.
we
don't
expect
that
kind
of
analysis
at
all.
but
if
their
process
is
to
be
rational,
and
if
we
are
to
know
that
it's
rational...
if
industry
is
to
know,
if
the
courts
are
to
know,
if
the
congress
is
to
know,
i
think
they
ought
to
spell
out
what
it
is
they
expect
to
get
for
how
much
money.
here,--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that
is
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
so,
because
at
that
point
we
don't
know
what
osha
is
doing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
at
that
point
it
is,
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so.
of
course,
the
alternative
strategy,
justice
stewart,
is
to
help
them
develop
the
criteria
to
save
the
statute,
rather
than
striking
it
down;
or
to
interpret
the
statute
so
that
it
is
done
to
avoid
that
constitutional
problem.
but
i
don't
think
we're
asking
anything
peculiar,
or
anything
they
don't
say
they're
doing;
we
are
asking
that
they
tell
us
what
they
are
doing,
that's
all.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
don't
think
so,
in
that
sense.
because
this
is
not,
there
are
toxic
substances
that
produce
harm
that
can't
be
reversed.
i
think
that's
a
very
different
case,
than
this
case
where,
despite
some
confusions
upon
the
topic--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
think--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
think
section
6
is
the
appropriate
section,
but
i
think
all
standards
are
also
governed
by
section
3.8.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
rely,
justice
stevens,
on
both
of
those
sections.
it
seems
to
me
that
both
3.8
and--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
we
agree
it
is
a
toxic
substance.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
wants
to
discuss
6(b)(5)
alone,
that
the
requirement
of
a
cost-benefit
comparison,
and
articulation
of
reasons,
is
to
be
found
in
6(b)(5).
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right,
i
think
it
would
be
found,
justice
stevens,
in
the
reasonably
necessary
language
of
the
section.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
confess,
justice
stevens,
at
the
moment
i
don't
quite
perceive
the
dilemma
i'm
in.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
justice
stevens,
if
i
may
ask,
it
would
seem
to
me,
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
that
if
it
was
a
toxic
substance
case
you
can
derive
it
and
should
derive
it
from
6(b)(5)
to
the
extent
feasible.
if
it
is
a
non-toxic
substance
case,
it
seems
to
me
it
can
be
derived
and
should
be
derived
from
the
language
that
a
standard
must
be
one
which
is
reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate.
is
that...
am
i
still
in
a
dilemma?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
my
time
is
gone,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
that
congress
provided
cost-benefit
for
toxic
substances
alone.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
general
requirement
of
the
act.
