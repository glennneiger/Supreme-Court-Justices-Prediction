mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
textile
industry
has
presented
two
main
challenges
to
the
cotton
dust
standard
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
cost-benefit
issue,
second
is
the
factual
claim
that
the
administrative
record
does
not
support
the
secretary's
findings
of
economic
feasibility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'd
be
happy
to.
i
was
just
about
to
do
it.
i
wanted
to
say
about
the
second
part
of
petitioner's
argument,
the
substantial
evidence,
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
analyzed
that
factual
question.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
professor
bork
is
incorrect
in
saying
that
the
cotton
dust
standard
was
issued
pursuant
to
any
sort
of
carcinogen
policy.
it
doesn't...
it
was
not
at
all.
it
was
issued
pursuant
to
substantial
evidence
of
a
significant
health
risk
at
the
current
exposure
level.
the
pre-standard
current
exposure
level.
there
were
105,000
pages
of
record
in
this
case,
and
they
pointed
conclusively
to
a
substantial
risk
of
material
health
impairment
at
the
1,000
microgram
level.
dr.
merchant
produced
a
dose-response
curve,
it
was
not
subject
to
serious
challenge
at
the
administrative
hearing,
showed
that
at
that
level
26
percent
of
the
workers
would
be
exposed
to
some
risk
of
byssinosis.
also
showed
that
at
the
level
that
the
secretary
proposed
that
risk
would
be
cut
in
half,
to
13
percent.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
we
think,
both
that
the
secretary
satisfied
the
benzene
standard,
and
that
he
issued
the
standard
pursuant
to
substantial
evidence
of
the
significant
health
risk
that
the
standard
would
reduce,
not
pursuant
to
any
so-called
policy.
this
is
just
another
industry
red
herring.
now
professor
bork
made
another...
a
number
of
other
misstatements
about
the
record
that
are
purely
factual.
i
want
to
just
mention
them
very
briefly.
the
answers
are
all
in
our
brief.
i
don't
think
it's
very
useful
here
to
replay
the
evidentiary
disputes
that
the
secretary
resolved
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
respirators
are
not
feasible,
the
record
quite
clearly
shows
that.
secondly,
the
industry's
approach
in
this
case,
and
certainly
the
basis
for
the
so-called
atmi
alternative
was
this
notion
that
the
low-grade
of
byssinosis
were
no
more
damaging
than
the
common
cold.
that's
absolutely
incorrect.
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
of
material
health
risk
even
at
low
levels
of
byssinosis,
and
more
important,
the
secretary
found
that
it's
a
continuum
of
disease.
dr.
harley,
the
industry's
main
witness,
testified
that
byssinosis
is
a
continuum
of
disease,
but
it
doesn't
progress
in
a
rational
fashion.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
well,
the
secretary
has
always
taken
the
position--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
means
economically
affordable
by
the
industry
as
a
whole,
not
by
every
individual
employer
in
the
industry.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right.
that
it
won't
materially
impair
the
industry's
financial
condition,
industry
will
be
able
to
maintain
long-term
competitiveness
and
profit
levels.
and
here,
the
secretary
found,
the
industry
as
a
whole
will
not
be
threatened
by
the
capital
requirements
of
the
regulation,
that's
page
27378.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
because
in
that
situation--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it
would
not
be
feasible
if
people
would
no
longer
buy
cotton,
the
industry
would
go
out
of
business.
but
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well
that's
right,
and
the
secretary
went
into
all
of
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
perhaps
then
if
the
costs--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
if
the
costs
could
all
be
passed
along
to
the
consumers,
the
consumers
would
still
be
able
to
buy,
would
still
buy
the
product,
then
the
health
costs
are
the
cost
of
doing
business.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
the
secretary
has
the
burden
of
proving
economic
feasibility,
he
does...
he
does
analyses,
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
evidence
showed
that
there
would
be
a
decrease
in
demand
for
cotton
of
only
about
1
or
2
percent
under
the
secretary's
proposed
standard,
and
that
costs
could
rise
to
keep
the
same
profit
levels,
only--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
correct.
feasibility
though,
is
a
requirement
before
section
6(b)(5)--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
that
i
agree
with
professor
bork
and
certainly
with
the
lower
court,
that
section
6(b)(5)
has
construed
the
word
feasible
to
mean
both
technologically
and
economically
feasible.
that's
what
we
think
congress
meant.
that's...
in
other
statutes,
such
as
the
clean
air
act
which
was
passed
the
same
week
as
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
congress
specifically
said
economically
and
technologically
feasible,
and
in
this
statute,
that's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well
i
don't
think,
congress
doesn't
act
in
computer-like
fashion,
but
i
think
that
when
in
the
same
week
they
used
the
word
feasible
and
define
it
to
mean
both
economic
and
technological
feasibility,
that
that's
what
they
mean
when
they...
the
same
week,
used
the
word
feasible
without
the
modifiers.
there's
no
suggestion
in
very
lengthy
legislative
history,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
they
meant
anything
other
than
economic
or
technological
feasibility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
there
were
substantial--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
was
testimony
by
experts
in
the
field
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
no,
no.
there
were
express
findings
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
cent
per
profit
cent,
how
much
each
garment
would
go
up,
these
are
all
of
course
speculations,
but
informed
ones,
osha
did
not
talk
in
vague
generalities.
the
preamble
to
this
standard
takes
up
some
40
or
50
pages
of
three
column,
small
type
in
the
federal
register,
justifying
every
single
finding
that
the
secretary
made,
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
100
pages
analyzing
the
record
very
carefully
to
conclude
that
the
secretary's
findings
as
regard
to
these
petitioners
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the...
anyway,
i
just
want
to
mention
another
one
of
the
misstatements
i
think
that
was
made,
because
i
think
it's
important,
the
secretary
does
not
engage
in
the
cost-benefit
analysis
under
section
6(g),
he
sets
priorities,
by
statute
he
sets
priorities.
and
it
didn't
take
very
much
sophistication
for
the
secretary
to
realize
that
the
number
one
priority
facing
the
textile
industry
in
terms
of
health
was
cotton
dust.
he
didn't
engage
in
any
cost-benefit
analysis
to
make
that
decision;
it
was
obvious
it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--not
with
the
same
set
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but
not,
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
the
same
sort
of
mathematical
precision
that
these
petitioners
are
going
to
require--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--every
rational
decision
takes
into
account
costs
and
benefits,
perhaps,
but
it
doesn't
weigh
them
the
way
the
petitioners
suggest
the
secretary
has
to
weigh
them
in
some
sort
of
fine
balance
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
the
secretary
does
that
under
section
6(g),
and
therefore
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
when
the
standard
is
issued,
that
under
section
6(g)
and
under
section
6(b)(5),
and
under
section
3(8),
that
it's
going
to
be
irrational.
let
me
also
mention--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
findings
are
in
the
preamble
to
the
standard
which
is
published
in
volume
43
of
the
federal
register.
we
have
supplied--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
the
federal
register
contains--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it's
in
the
federal
register
and
we
have
supplied
a
copy
to
every
justice
of
this
court,
that
these
are
the
secretary's
findings
to
justify
the
standard.
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
each
of
those
findings,
with
regard
to
these
petitioners,
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
i
don't
understand--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
discussion
of
economic
feasibility
is
at
page
27378,
federal
register,
and
the
key
finding
that
was
backed
up
by
a
great
deal
of
evidence
and
cost
figures,
is
that
industry
as
a
whole
will
not
be
threatened
by
the
capital
requirements
of
the
regulation.
that
these
cost--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you're
referring
to,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--let
me
also
address
the
statement
that
mr.
justice
stevens
was
making
to
professor
bork
at
the
very
end,
about
section
3(8)--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
they
were
not...
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
they
are
in
the
federal
register
which
is
of
course
a
public
document,
and
we
did
supply,
or
we
sent
it
up
to
the
clerk...
i'm
surprised
it
hasn't
been
distributed
with
the
cover
letter.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
all,
it's
easily
accessible
to
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's...
the
federal
register,
june
23rd,
1978,
federal
register,
beginning
at
page
27350
and
i'm
sure
the
clerk
will
be
happy
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes
it
does,
it's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
we
sent
that
up
about
10
days
ago.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well
i'm
not
sure
that
we
had
an
obligation
under
the
rules
to
reprint
all
of
this,
it
would
have
been
very
burdensome.
we
thought
it
would
be
useful
for
the
court,
rather
than
simply
to
have
the
court
go
to
the
library
to
get
a
public
document,
that
we
give
xerox
copies.
we
understand...
the
petitioner's
of
course,
had
the
burden
of
producing
the
appendix,
and
not
the
respondents.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
way
that
this
case
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
economic
feasibility
argument.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
on.
the
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
one
of
the
four
questions,
which
just
went
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
applied
a
substantial
evidence
test.
i'd
like
to
spend
my
limited
time
discussing
what
i
think
is
the
key
issue
in
the
case,
which
is
the
cost-benefit
issue.
it's
become
something
of
a
rallying
cry
for
industry
forces
in
this
area.
simply
stated,
petitioners
claim
that
the
secretary
may
not
issue
an
occupational
health
standard
for
toxic
substances
till
he
first
determines,
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence,
that
the
benefits
of
the
standard
bear
a
"reasonable
relationship"
to
the
attendant
costs.
i
think
it's
important
to
begin
this
discussion
by
repeating
what
the
court
said
just
a
month
ago
in
the
crushed
stone
case.
that
is
that
the
question
here
is
not
what
the
court
thinks
is
generally
appropriate
to
the
regulatory
process.
congress
is,
the
question
is
what
congress
intended.
we've
heard
a
great
deal
from
the
textile
industry,
both
in
its
briefs
and
from
professor
bork
today,
about
wise
policy
choices.
the
issue
here--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
did
not,
and
that
is
our
point,
that
there
is,
that
the
construction
statute
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
we
think,
reflects
wise
policy,
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
either
expressly
or
by
reasonable
implication
that
requires
the
secretary
to
engage
in
so-called
cost-benefit
analysis
before
issuing
a
health--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
there
is.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if,
i
think
that
if
justice
rehnquist
were
right
about
the
statute,
he
would
be
right
about
his
conclusions.
but
the
statute
sets
criteria
that
the
secretary
has
to
follow.
there
is
first
of
all,
section
6(b)(5),
which
says
that
the
secretary
can't
issue
any
standard
unless
he
first
finds
that
there's
a
significant
risk
of
material
health
impairment
in
the
work
place,
that
it's
an
unsafe
work
place.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
that
the
standard
would
substantially
reduce
that
risk.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
that's
right.
that's
a
substantial--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
is
a
substantial
check
on
the
secretary
now,
he
can't
issue--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
don't
want
to
re-argue
the
benzene
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but,
be
happy
to
if
i
thought
the
result
might
change.
but,
the
point
is
that
in
light
of
section
3(8)
as
construed
by
this
court
in
benzene,
the
secretary
now
in
issuing
health
standards,
has
to
find
that
there's
a
significant
risk
of
material
health
impairment
and
his
standard
will
reduce
that
risk.
he
also
has
to
find
that
it's
technologically
and
economically
feasible.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it's
not
the
government's
position,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
one
thing
that
i
agree
with
professor
bork
about,
is
that
these
are
not
issues
that
can
be
decided
in
the
abstract.
the
economic
feasibility
determination
is
that
basic
factual
determination
by
the
secretary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--with
judicial
review--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
but
the
secretary
did
make
findings
in
this
case,
justice
powell.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think,
once
again,
page
27378
is
the
prime
discussion
of
this
issue.
the
secretary
found
that
only
certain
marginal
employers,
very
close
to
the
margin...
first
of
all,
the
secretary
found
that
there
was
a
concentration
process
going
on
in
this
industry,
wholly
regardless
of
health
standards,
that
firms
at
the
margin,
because
of
economies
of
scale
or
other
reasons,
were
simply
not
making
it
and
going
out
of
business.
it's
not
a
very
heavily
concentrated
industry
by
the
way,
by
and
large.
there
are--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
yes,
he
did.
he
found
that
there
was
great
excess
capacity
in
the
industry
as
it
was,
there
was
not
going
to
be
a
great
deal
of
expansion
going
on--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
does,
and
osha
must
consider,
in
making
the
economic
feasibility
determination,
the
industry's
capital
needs,
the
industry's
costs
of
doing
business.
and
it
has
to
determine
if,
by
adding
to
those
costs,
the
costs
of
the
proposed
standard,
the
industry
as
a
whole
will
be
able
to
function
much
the
same
way
it
was
functioning
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
standard.
it's
no
suggestion
that
the
secretary
thinks
that
the
way
to
solve
health
problems
is
to
take
away
the
productive
activity
that
causes
the
health
problems.
the
purpose
is
to
try
to
reach
some
reasonable
accommodation.
the
word
feasibility
does
that,
and
i
think
the
other
standards
of
the
statute
do
that.
let
me,
i
do
want
to
address
this
one
question
that
justice
stevens
asked
professor
bork
about
section
3(8)
because
i
think
it's
an
important
question
in
the
court's
determination
of
the
answer
to
this
case.
that
is,
that
section
3(8)
could
not
have
been
thought
to
have
any
cost-benefit
analysis
in
it,
because
if
you
recall,
section
3(8)
was
a
definitional
section,
it
was
in
the
statute
in
precisely
the
same
form
it
exists
today
from
the
very
beginning,
and
yet,
senators
dominick
and
senator
javits
and
others
were
quite
concerned
during
the
latter
stages
of
the
legislative
history,
that
the
statute
might
require
absolute
hell
for
spending
a
lot
of
money
for
things
that
weren't
worth
it,
and
they
restructured
section
6(b)(5)
to
take
account
of
that,
by
adding
the
feasibility
language
and
material
health
language
and
all
the
rest,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
them
to
have
engaged
in
that
discussion
if
anybody
thought
that
a
cost-benefit
analysis
was
already
in
the
reasonably
necessary
or
appropriate
phrase
in
section
3(8).
but
nobody
suggested
that,
during
a
length
of
an
exceedingly
lengthy
legislative
history,
not
one
person
suggested
that
3(8)
meant
that.
section
3(8)--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's...
no
one
suggested
that
the
statute
was
going
to
require
that,
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
why
we
think
it's
totally--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
that
discussion
if
someone
thought
that
section
3(8)
already
imposed
a
cost-benefit
analysis
in
setting
standards.
section
3(8)
tells
the
secretary
when
he
may
issue
a
standard,
it
doesn't
tell
him
where
along
the
various
alternatives
he
should
issue--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
don't,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'd
be
happy
to
answer,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--thank
you.
