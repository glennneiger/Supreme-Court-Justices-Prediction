unknown
speaker
mr.
bork,
how
do
you
define
the
word
feasible
in
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
draw
that
definition
from
the
congressional
language
or
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that
the
industry
as
such
would
not
go...
not
cease
to
exist?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
the
one
that
osha
applied?
unknown
speaker
well
mr.
bork,
if
while
the
benzene
case
was
pending
here,
the
board
had
revoked
its
carcinogen
policy,
as
you
say
it
now
has,
would
we
have
remanded
that
benzene
case
for
reconsideration?
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
suggesting
that
that
should
be
done
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know
you
do.
but
this
is
a
very
recent
development,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
official--
unknown
speaker
--have
the
parties
given
us
anything,
mr.
bork?
unknown
speaker
i
haven't
heard
it
until
you
just
mentioned
it.
well
could,
i
know
you
have
other
points
but
it's
possible
that
would
be
dispositive--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
bork,
can
you
hypothesize
the
circumstances
in
which
a
major
industry,
producing
things
we
regard
as
necessary,
that
is,
the
entire
automobile
industry
and
the
entire
lumber
industry,
the
entire
cotton
industry...
can
you
hypothesize
any
situation
in
which
it
could
be
simply
closed
down
and
stopped,
by
operation
of
law?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
done
that
way?
could
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
through
its
mechanisms
such
as
we
have
here,
in
effect
say,
no
more
automobiles
shall
be
produced
because
automobiles
kill
63,000
people
a
year
and
injure
two
million
people
a
year,
and
therefore.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bork,
the
chief
justice
asked
you
if
the
congress
could
through
its
technicians,
accomplish
this
result?
my
understanding
of
the
act
was
that
congress
had
delegated
to
the
executive
branch
the
accomplishment
of
these
particular
results.
i
don't
know
if
your
answer
would
be
any
different
if
the
question
were
phrased
in
those
terms
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
of
your
points
is
that
there
was
an
overdelegation,
in
the
sense
that
it's...
a
delegation
without
any
standards,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
word
is
feasible,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
word
is
feasible,
i
mean,
not
economically
feasible?
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
some
other
kind
of
feasibility.
unknown
speaker
and
along
with
the
executives,
along
with
osha,
they
think
it
includes
economic--
unknown
speaker
--right.
but
the
statutory
standard
is
feasible.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bork,
could
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
suggestion
about
the
revocation
of...
osha's
carcinogen
policy?
i
didn't
understand...
this
is
not
a
carcinogen
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
did
they
expressly
rely
on
their
carcinogen
policy
here,
or
do
you
think
their
reasoning
was--
unknown
speaker
--comparable
to
that
used
in
the
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
was
the
lead
case
in
this
same
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
carcinogen
or
is
it
more
akin
to
this?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
the
lead
case,
in
this
same
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
was
that
like
this,
a
non-cancer-producing
agent?
or
was
it
a
cancer-producing
agent?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
reason
for
revoking
the
carcinogen
policy,
at
least
as
applied
in
cases
like
benzene,
was
the
failure
to
make
a
finding
that
was
made
in
this
case,
namely
that
there
was
a
significant
risk.
so
does
revocation
really
affect
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
contest
the
fact
there
was
such
a...
the
finding
required
by
benzene
was
made
here,
i
don't
think
you
dispute
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
you
don't
challenge
it
as
being
adequately
supported
by
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bork,
none
of
this,
i
gather,
as
you've
now
stated,
involves
an
argument
that
a
cost
benefit
analysis
was
obtained?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
second
point.
unknown
speaker
is
that
under
the
feasibility
or
under
the
reasonably
necessary?
unknown
speaker
under
both.
unknown
speaker
and
were
these
points
presented
this
way
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
but
in
these
terms,
in
the
terms
that
you
are
now
putting...
with
the
three
elements?
unknown
speaker
you're
inferring
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
these
particular
points?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bork,
can
i
ask
you
what
you...
for
a
little
clarification
of
the
second
point
in
your
three
points
that
are
required?
how
much
of
the
industry
must
be
destroyed
before
it's
no
longer
feasible?
supposing
that...
say
the
figure
is
25
percent
and
supposing
25
percent
of
the
firms
would
go
out
of
business
but
the
remaining
75
percent
would
be
able
to
expand
their
production
and
continue
to
produce
the
same
aggregate
amount
of
goods.
would
that
be
feasible
or
not
feasible
under
your
standard?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
are
advancing
a
proposition
that
there
must
be
measurement
of
the
percentage
of
the
industry
destroyed.
what
do
you
mean
by
destroying
industry,
is
that
to
mean
destroying
existing
firms
or
a
portion
of
the
total
output?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
not
there.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
not
there.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
osha
is
free
to
pick
whatever
approach
to
the
word
feasible
makes
sense,
as
long
as
it
follows
these
three
criteria?
unknown
speaker
because
certainly
there's
no
congressional
guidance
on
this
precise
point.
unknown
speaker
let
me
pursue
the
hypothetical
question
i
put
to
you
earlier,
mr.
bork.
in
your
view,
would
congress
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
bar
cigarettes,
for
example,
unless
they
can
demonstrate
that
all
negative
health
factors
were
eliminated?
could
congress
do
that
itself
via
statute?
unknown
speaker
second
question:
could
they
delegate
that,
by
a
structure
somewhat
like
the
usual
pattern
of
creating
a
commission
like
osha,
could
they
delegate
that
to
a
commission
on
tobacco
hazards?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
do
you
mean
by
that
if
the
commission,
after
hearings,
made
findings
that
it
had
this
definite
health
hazard
factor,
carcinogen-producing
elements,
then
the
commission
could--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with...
or
congress
would
not
be
limited
by
the
fact
that
this
would
put
a
great
many
people
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bork,
before
you
proceed,
does
osha
agree
with
your
assertion
that
it
has
authority,
under
the
act,
to
put
50
percent
of
a
major
industry
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
are
osha's
findings
in
the
papers
that
we
have
before
us?
i
couldn't
locate
them.
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
sure
the
solicitor
general
will
respond
to
my
question,
but
one
of
the
examples
you
gave
was
that...
i
understood
it,
that
under
the
standard
before
us
in
this
case
90
percent
of
the
industry
could
be
put
out
of
business
and
osha
would
still
claim
the
standard
was
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
did
osha
make
the
sort
of
findings
of
fact
that
we
expect
from
a
trial
court,
and
if
so,
where
are
they?
unknown
speaker
are
respirator
masks
a
guarantee
of
protection,
mr.
bork?
unknown
speaker
but
where
they
are
used,
are
they
a
guarantee?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
factor
that
renders
them
unfeasible?
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on
to
that,
mr.
bork,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
that
with
dropping
domestic
production
of
cotton
and
cotton
products--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
are
imports
that
are
taking
up
the
slack?
unknown
speaker
anything
to
prevent
congress
from,
or
osha,
from
providing
that
no
imports
would
be
permitted
in
this
country
unless
the
sources
complied
with
osha's
standards?
unknown
speaker
but,
how
would
we,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
would
we--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
would
we
send
inspectors
over
to--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
take
treaties.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
again,
mr.
bork,
we're
not
giving
you
much
chance,
i'm
afraid.
but,
in
connection
with
your
argument,
i
gather
what
you're
now
addressing
is
a
little
different
than
the
costs
discussion
you've
been
giving
us
as
to
unfeasibility--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
independent,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
cost
benefit?
now
isn't
cost
benefit
analysis
a...
that's
an
expression
of
art,
isn't
it,
some
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
yet,
what
we're
concerned
with
here,
i
gather,
is
what
the
relationship
is
of
cost
to
benefit,
and
how
do
you
define
benefit
here?
unknown
speaker
production
of
the
pel,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
from
this...
cost
question?
unknown
speaker
well
even
if
you
are
right,
where
in
the
statute
is
the
requirement
that
osha
do
what
you're
now
suggesting
osha
should
have
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we'd
all
be
better
off
if
congress
had
said
in
express
terms
that
osha
should
have
done
a
cost
benefit-analysis.
what
kind
do
you
suggest?
unknown
speaker
well
are
we
going
to...
if
they
must
do
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
are
we
not
going
to
have
to
define
what
we
mean
by
cost-benefit
analysis?
unknown
speaker
spelling
it
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bork,
do
you
think
they
can
do
it
in
a
meaningful
way
without
putting
a
value
on
human
life?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
not
have
to
put
a
dollar
value
on
the
irreversible
stage
of
the
disease
at
least?
unknown
speaker
but
one
side
of
the
equation
is
all
measured
in
dollars.
unknown
speaker
so,
to
that
extent,
i
gather,
what
you're
suggesting
is
judgmental?
unknown
speaker
the
ultimate
conclusion
has
to
be
judgmental.
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
dollar
terms,
based
on
the
benefits?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
statute
requires
that
they
do
so?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
your
further
contention
that
if
the
statute
doesn't
require
they
should
do
so,
that
the
statute,
there
may
be
constitutional
doubts
about
the
statute
itself?
unknown
speaker
a
successive
delegation
standard
for
this
delegation--
unknown
speaker
--unless
the
statute
requires
them
to
do
what
you
indicated?
unknown
speaker
one
final
question,
if
i
may,
mr.
bork.
do
you
contend
that
this
is
a
toxic
substance
case
under
section
6,
or
whatever
the
number
is,
do
you
contend
there
is
any
difference
in
the
cost-benefit
analysis
in
a
toxic
substance
case
than
in
any
other
standards?
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
got
to
decide
which
section
of
the
statute
we're
working
with,
and
section
6,
where
the
word
feasibility
is
found,
is
in
the
toxic
substance
section.
do
you...
first
of
all,
do
you
agree
that
that's
the
appropriate
section
for
purposes
of
statutory
analysis?
unknown
speaker
assuming
it's
a
toxic
substance.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if,
if
they
are
governed
by
3.8,
and
that's
the
source
of
the
cost-benefit
requirement,
then
i
don't
think
you
can
rely
on
the
word
feasibility.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
rely
on
both
if
it's
not
a
toxic
substance
case,
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
we've
got
to
think
through
the
question
whether
the
rule
is
different
for
a
toxic
substance
than
it
is
for
a
non-toxic
substance.
unknown
speaker
well
no,
my
point
is
somewhat
different.
my
point
is,
when
one
is
confronted
with
a
non-toxic
substance
and
therefore
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
the
language
in
6(b)(5),
is
there
also
a
cost-benefit
requirement.
and
if
so,
that
requirement
is
found
independently
of
the
feasibility
language.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
enough,
then
you
can't
really
rely
on
the
feasibility
language.
seems
to
me
you're
in
somewhat
of
a
dilemma
and
i
don't
know
what
the
right
answer
is,
but
i--
unknown
speaker
--well
if
the
reasonably
necessary
language
requires
cost-benefit
analysis
for
all
standards,
then
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
the
feasibility
language.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
must
look
at
the
feasibility
language
in
order
to
justify
or
to
support
your
argument
that
cost-benefit
is
appropriate,
then
you
do
not
require
cost-benefit
in
non-toxic
substance
cases,
which
would
be
somewhat
ironic,
because
that
would
mean
that
you
have
a
more
strict
standard,
the
agency
has
a
stricter
burden,
in
the
toxic
substance
case
than
in
the
non-toxic
substance
case.
unknown
speaker
well
i
think
you
are,
but
i
won't
take
up
any
more
of
your
time,
because--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
one
has
to
decide
whether
congress
intended
a
different
standard
for
toxic
substances
than
it
did
for
non-toxic
substances.
having
made
that
decision,
then
one
must
decide
which
portions
of
the
statute
will
support
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
geller,
are
you
going
to
address
this
development
of
a
couple
of
days
ago?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
to
tell
from
osha's
announcements
in
this
case
what
it
understands
feasible
to
be,
to
mean?
unknown
speaker
is
it
something
more
than
affordable?
unknown
speaker
so
what...
just
as
long
as
it's
affordable
by
the
industry
as
a
whole?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
if
the
record
showed
that
compliance
would
increase
the
cost
of
cotton
to
the
ultimate
consumer
by
500
percent,
that
then
we
could
go
ahead?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
put
any
limit
on
the
economic
feasibility
in
your
earlier
statement.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
depend
upon
the
elasticity
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--finding
that
it
was
an
absolutely
inelastic
demand,
and
it
could
be
increased
1000
percent--
unknown
speaker
--amount
of
purchasing.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
whole
country
wait
until
we
find
out
whether
it's
going
to
make
the
cost
go
up
1000
or
500
percent?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
you
refer
to
the
word...
the
phrase
that
the
secretary
has
the
burden
of
proving
economic
feasibility,
as
i
recall,
the
statute
simply
says
if
feasible,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well
why
do
you
read
the
word
economic
into
it?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
that
be
almost
an
argument
against
your
position,
if
congress
the
same
week,
when
using
the
word
feasible,
had
modified
it
with
the
words
economic
and
technologically,
and
in
this
statute
it
simply
said
if
feasible--
unknown
speaker
--incidentally,
mr.
geller,
you
just
mentioned
pass
the
cost
on
to
the
consumer,
was
there
any
finding
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
there
was
an
extreme
assumption,
i
think
that's
the
language,
but
what
was
the
supporting
evidence
that
it
could
be
passed
on
or
would
be?
unknown
speaker
no
well,
i'm
asking,
what
finding
other
than
the
expression
extreme
assumption?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
instinctively
do,
as
professor
bork
suggested.
every
decision
that
every
person
or
institution
makes
is
instinctively
or
implicitly
inherently...
a
cost-benefit
decision.
unknown
speaker
even
in
the
setting
of
priorities.
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
play
an
extra
rubber
of
bridge,
you
weigh
the
pleasure
of
playing
an
extra
rubber
of
bridge
with
the
loss
of
sleep
that's
going
to
be
incurred.
every
decision
that's
made
is
a
cost-benefit
decision,
is
it
not?
every
rational
decision?
unknown
speaker
in
the
setting
of
priorities,
it's
a
cost-benefit
decision.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
mr.
bork
mentioned
the
fact
that
there
were
no
findings
and
i
can't
find
any
findings.
now
will
you
tell
me
where
they
are?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
findings
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
want
us
to
go
read
that,
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well
what
finding
did
they
make
on
economic
feasibility?
what
was
the
quote
and
end-quote
finding?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
other
case
that
we've
decided
that
we
didn't
have
papers
we
were
deciding
it
on?
unknown
speaker
we're
referring
to
what's
in
the
federal
register
and
is
not
in
this
court.
unknown
speaker
period.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
i
think
just
as
a
matter
of
mechanics,
i
don't
recall
ever
seeing
the
copy
of
the
decision
that
is...
the
findings
that
you
say
are
in
the
federal
register
and
were
supplied
to
each
of
us
individually;
i
don't
think
they
were.
unknown
speaker
i
frankly
assumed
they
were
in
the
joint
appendix--
unknown
speaker
--well
i
don't
think
it
was.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
have
it
before
me...
saving
money
by
not
putting
it
in
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
does
it
look
like
what
you
have
in
your
hands?
unknown
speaker
i've
never
seen
it.
unknown
speaker
does
that
comply
with
our
rules
with
respect
to
type
size
and
page...
pagination?
unknown
speaker
which
if
any
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
certiorari
petition
do
you
think
raise
a
question
that
requires
us
to
decide
whether
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
a
finding?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
you
about
how
the
case
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--congress
didn't
say
anything
about
cost-benefit
analysis,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well
was
there
anything
in
the
statute
then,
that
sets
any
standards
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no
there
isn't,
then,
is
my
brother
rehnquist's
opinion
in
the
benzene
case,
is
a
telling
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the...
there,
as
we
held
in
benzene,
misconstrued
that
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well
those
were...
that's
what
was
involved
in
the
benzene
case.
unknown
speaker
in
which
we
had
to
correct
the
misapprehensions
of
osha.
unknown
speaker
well
it
wasn't
understood
by
osha
to
be
any
check
at
all,
until
the
benzene
case,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well
of
course
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
i'd
like
to
come
back
with
a
question
that
i
put
to
professor
bork,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
this
standard
would
be
perfectly
valid
under
the
act
if
it
destroyed
50
percent
of
the
cotton
industry
in
the
united
states,
whether
you
measure
it
by
number
of
companies
or
by
total
output,
was
that
the
government's
position?
unknown
speaker
suppose
10
percent,
would
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
what
troubles
me
and
perhaps
others,
is
that
we're
not
getting
any
guidance,
at
least
i've
found
none
so
far
in
this
case,
as
to
what
the
impact
of...
economically
speaking,
you
admit
that
that's
important...
in
view
of
the
competition
that
our
industry,
our
major
industries
are
now
suffering
from
industries
in
foreign
countries,
i
would
have
thought
osha
would
have
taken
a
better,
closer
look,
to
ascertain
whether
50,
20,
25,
45
percent
of
the
cotton
industry
was
going
to
be
put
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
where
are
they,
specifically?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
did
the
secretary
consider
in
these
findings
that
we
haven't
seen,
whether
these
standards
would
materially
affect
the
capability
of
the
industry
to
modernize
and
expand
and
improve
its
production
facilities?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
excess
capacity
in
the
steel
industry,
but
it's
suffering
from
competition
for
more
modern
facilities
in
japan
and
germany.
i
just
don't
know
whether
osha
considered
or
considers
that
the
act
requires
it
to
weigh
factors
of
this
kind.
unknown
speaker
it
does?
unknown
speaker
well
there
wasn't
really
any
discussion
of
cost-benefit
as
such,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
the
discussion
was
whether
this
was
some
sort
of
an
absolute
requirement?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
raises
no
delegation
questions
under
schechter
and
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
and
your
time
doesn't
permit
you
to
go
beyond
that,--
unknown
speaker
--you're
in
your
colleague's
time
now.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
excuse
me.
no,
go
ahead.
what
is
your
definition
of
the
word
if
feasible,
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
imported
into
the
statute
by
this
court,
or
by--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean
yet.
unknown
speaker
and
osha,
and
osha.
unknown
speaker
and
that
feasible
includes
economically
feasible,
everybody
agrees?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
cost-benefit
analysis?
what
do
you
think
the
other
side
means
by
it?
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
are
very...
so
far,
what
you
have
said
is
meaningless.
and
so--
unknown
speaker
--apparently
then,
what
your
opposition
is
saying,
you
think,
is
meaningless?
unknown
speaker
well
let
me
ask
you,
you
say
the
statute
does
not
require
a
cost-benefit
analysis.
now,
you
tell
me
what
you
think
you're
saying
the
statute
doesn't
require?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
that
it
doesn't
require?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
may
have
suggested
before
that...
well,
isn't
that
a
cost-benefit
judgment
in
itself?
unknown
speaker
that
the
benefits
that
you're
going
to
get,
are
worth
whatever--
unknown
speaker
--are
worth
whatever
impact
there
is
on
the
industry?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know,
but
the
secretary
has
too.
you've...
i
suppose,
he
sets
these
levels
after
having
concluded
that
the
impact
on
the
industry
isn't
so
great
that
he
should
set
a
higher
standard.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
at
least
you
think
that's
all
the
cost-benefit
analysis
the
statute
requires?
unknown
speaker
and
in
any
event
it
does
not
require
any
quantifying
in
dollar
terms,
of
the
benefits?
unknown
speaker
it
may,
on
the
cost
side,
but
not
on
the
benefit
side.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
i
take
it
it's
undisputed
that
congress,
under
its
commerce
power,
could
flatly
ban
child
labor?
supposing
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
we
ban
child
labor
to
the
extent
it
is
feasible,
and
delegate
to
osha
the
promulgation
of
regulations
for
banning
it.
what
do
you
think
osha
would
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
it
was
my
question
that
you
were
trying
to
get
back
to.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
you
keep
saying
that
the
problem
is
and
the
complaint
of
petitioner
is
that
osha
didn't
go
through
this.
i
thought
the
complaint
was
osha
hasn't
yet
told
anybody
what
they
did?
now
isn't
that
the
complaint
the
petitioners
made,
is
that
you
can
do
anything...
that
you
can
find
out
whether
they
did
right
or
wrong.
unknown
speaker
is
that
their
position?
unknown
speaker
how
many
businesses
would
be
put
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
how
many
business
would
be
put--
unknown
speaker
--did
they
find
any
figures
as
to
how
many
would
go
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
how
many?
unknown
speaker
well
you
have
to
put
it
in
there
if
i
should
know
it.
unknown
speaker
and
now,
you
didn't
put
that
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
make,
he
made
conclusions
of
law,
he
didn't
make
findings.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that?
we
take
his
word.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
and
we
take
his
word
and
your
word.
that's
the
answer.
