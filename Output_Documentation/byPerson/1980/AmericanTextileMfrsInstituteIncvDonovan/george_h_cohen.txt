mr.
george
h.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
george
cohen,
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
union
respondents.
although
i'm
not
sure
this
is
the
point
to
put
the
proper
focus
on
it,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
mr.
justice
powell
that,
in
response
to
your
questions,
your
honor,
that
the
research
triangle
institute
studies
which
were
the
contractor
working
for
the
department
of
labor
at
joint
appendix
pages
118,
120
and
123,
discuss
precisely
the
question
that
your
honor
raised,
and
basically
concluded
that
insofar
as
achieving
the
costs
necessary
to
achieve
the
standard
that
the
secretary
set,
the
demand,
the
total
demand
for
cotton
products
in
this
country
would
go
down
approximately
one
percent,
and
the
impact
on
employment
would
be
approximately.6
percent.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
words
of
the
statute
are
to
the
extent
feasible,
there's
a
bit
of
deja
vu
in
this,
because
we
do
this
together
in
the
benzene
case,
our...
my
answer
then
and
my
answer
today,
as
further
enlightened
by
this
court's
decision
in
benzene,
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
was
not
seeking
to
impose
impossible,
impossible
health...
a
solution
that
would
be
impossible
as
far
as
industry
would
be
concerned,
and
that
impossibility
has
been
translated
into
two
dimensions.
number
one,
that
it
must
be
achievable
in
the
sense
that
there
is
the
technology
and
work
place
practices
available,
so-called
technologically
feasible.
the
economic
feasibility
aspect
which
has
also
been
imported
into
the
statute,
is
in
essence
what
this
case...
or
what--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--no,
i
don't
think
it's
been
imported
into
the
statute
by
this
court,
i
think
senator
dominick--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well,
i
thought
the
question,
mr.
justice
marshall,
was
does
the
origin
of
the
importing
come
out
of
this
court?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
i
think
this
court
properly
concluded
that
the
legislative
history
as
reflected
most
precisely
by
senator
dominick,
the
leading
spokesman
for
the
nixon
administration
as
this
bill
was
passing
through
the
halls
of
congress,
who
made
it
very
clear
that
what
he
was
most
concerned
about...
and
this
then
became
the
consensus
of
the
senatorial
concern,
was
that
in
the
name
of
providing
safety
and
health
what
would
happen
would
be
that
you
would
drive
industries
as
a
whole
out
of
business
and
ban
occupations
as
a
whole
in
the
course
of
that
process.
and
it
was
that
concern,
whether
one
wants
to
then
put
in
terms
the
word
economic,
feasibility
which
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
with
and
all
the
reviewing
courts
have
used,
and
this
court--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--and
osha,
yes.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes,
everybody
agrees
there.
the
question,
among
the
questions
presented
here
is
in
order
for
something
to
be
feasible,
must
this
magical
cost-benefit
analysis
be
done,
we
of
course
reject
that
argument.
we
reject
it
because
we
say,
number
one,
it's
not
there
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
number
two,
it
is
not
there
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
mr.
justice
white,
i
must
confess
that
the
more
one
studies
this
issue
the
less,
i
think,
one
comprehends
it.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well
i--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--i
do
that,
yes.
and
i'll
be
glad
to,
i'll
be
glad
to
explain
why.
we've
been
told
that,
let's
take
the
industry
position.
they
have
rejected
the
notion
that
"formal"
cost-benefit
analysis
should
be
done.
they've
rejected
the
notion
that
anything
more
than
saying
there's
a
reasonable
balance
between
costs
and
benefits
is
necessary.
they've
rejected
the
notion
that
you're
going
to
place
a
value
on
human
life.
now
let's
take
this
case
as
a
frame
of
reference.
we
know,
as
government
counsel--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--yes.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
it
doesn't
require,
after
the
secretary
has
laid
the...
has
done
the
following:
has
met
the
threshold
determination,
made
a
threshold
determination
that
we
have
a
significant
risk
of
health
involved,
and
that
that
risk
can,
through
a
variety
of
procedures,
be
dramatically
reduced.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
that
the
secretary
must
select
the
most
protective
way
to
achieve
that
result,
consistent
to
the
constraint
or
consistent
with
a
constraint
and
the
constraint
is
that
it
must
be
feasible,
it
must
be
technologically
achievable
and
it
must
be
feasible
in
the
economic
sense,
namely,
that
as
a
result
of
complying
with
this
standard
industry
as
a
whole's
financial
viability
will
not
be
challenged.
and
that,
at
that
point,
mr.
justice
white,
our
position
is
the
secretary's
obligations
are
over
and
the
standard
is
entitled
to--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--all
right.
now--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--i
think
you
are
precisely
correct.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes,
we
believe
you
are
precisely
correct
in
this
sense.
we
believe
that
what
congress
did
was,
in
effect,
do
its
own
"cost-benefit
analysis".
congress
made
the
determination--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well
if
you...
on
your
terms--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--that's
what
the
secretary
has
said,
that's
what
we
believe
satisfies
the
statute--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well
i
have
a
sense
of
responsibility.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
into
thinking
the
other
side
agrees
that
that's
a
cost-benefit
analysis.
we
think
that
is
a
cost-benefit
analysis,
in
the
sense
that
that's
all
the
congress
was
concerned--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--exactly.
and
that
is
the
policy
judgment--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--absolutely.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
absolutely.
and
i
want
to
just
carry
that
point
one
step
forward,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
you...
reading
the
industry
position
knowing
as
they
come
before
the
court
and
tell
you,
that
it
doesn't
require
valuing
human
life,
there's
only
one
way
to
get
away
from
that
proposition
and
they
try
to
get
away
with
it
by
saying
what
the
secretary
should
be
doing
in
setting
a
standard
for
one
toxic
substance,
is
to
compare
what
the
risk
is
going
to
be
for
other
potential
hazards,
what
the
technological
feasibility
will
be
for
all
of
those
other
hazards,
what
the
cost
of
compliance
will
be
for
all
of
those
hazards,
and
in
that
nice,
simple,
little
package,
says
the
atmi,
we
have
offered
a
"feasible
solution"
to
ways
this
statute
should
be
interpreted.
now
that
in
our
judgment,
in
effect,
would
be
asking
the
secretary
of
labor,
in
the
name
of
doing
something,
to
do
everything,
he
would
have
to
inventory
the
entire
list
of
every
single
potential
toxic
substance.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
think...
i
don't
think,
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
i
don't
think
we're
anywhere
near
that
in
this
case.
we
have
much
clearer
guidance
from
congress
than
the
discussion
and
rhetoric
that's
gone
back
and
forth
here
in
court
today,
and
our
brief
spells
out
what
that
discussion
was
and
what
those
concerns
were.
now
i
know
we've
got
a
hypothetical,
but
let
me
stay
with
the
concerns.
the
concern
was
that
small
employers
particularly,
were
not
devoting
the
necessary
capital
investments
in
order
to
provide
safe
and
healthy
work
places.
congress
understood
this
was
a
problem.
this
is
not
a
problem
that's
just
emerged
in
the
context
of
the
cotton
dust
case.
and
congress
said,
we
are
going
to
insist
on
a
uniform,
nationwide
approach;
we're
going
to
compel
each
and
every
employer
to
meet
these
standards
because
if
we
don't
go
that
way
we're
never
going
to
get
it,
the
ultimate
protection
that
this
statute
is
all
about.
congress
went
further.
they
also
understood,
and
there's
been
discussions
here
of
who
would
go
out
of
business?
well
we're
way
removed
from
that
problem
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says
that
the
american
textile
manufacturing
industry
concedes
that
at
550
million
dollars
there's
no
economic
feasibility
problem
insofar
as
the
entire
industry
as
a
whole
is
concerned.
but
getting
back
to
my
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--yes.
i
am
trying
to.
what
i
guess
i'm
saying
is
that
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
what
precise
tools
would
be
brought
to
bear
to
deal
with
the
child
labor.
i
am
saying
that
the
tools
are
there
to
deal
with
it,
based
on
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute.
and
i
hadn't
finished
that
precise
point.
and
it
was.
not
only
was
the
judgment
uniform,
nationwide,
small
employers,
but
there
is
a
recognition
that
this
would
well
or
might
well
have
a
severe
impact
on
small
employers.
that
was
not
something
that
comes
out
of
the
blue;
that
was
a
major
subject
of
concern.
senator
dominick
repeated
that
concern,
but
what
was
the
solution?
was
it
to
carve
out
or
exempt
the
small
marginal
employer?
no.
was
it
to
dilute
the
protection
of
the
statute
as
to
workers
in
those
plants?
what
congress
said,
in
section
28,
will
address
this
in
terms
of
a
small
business
loan
proposition.
if
an
employer
who
would
otherwise
be
driven
out
of
business
needs
the
economic
wherewithal
to
be
able
to
comply,
we
will
afford
that
program.
very
similar,
incidentally,
to
the
program
that
this
court
addressed--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--mr.
justice
marshall--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--that's
their
position.
we
and
the
solicitor
general
have
each
responded
to
that
proposition.
what
we
have
said,
basically,
is
insofar
as
economic
feasibility
is
concerned,
that
the
aggregate
amount
of
money,
the
550
million
dollars
which
the
secretary
found
wasn't
a
dream,
it
was
a
finding.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
the
secretary--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--of
labor
found
one
thing,
one
precise
thing
on
this
point.
he
said
industry--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--he
said
although
some
marginal
employers,
although
some
marginal
employers
might
choose
to
go
out
of
business
rather
than
comply,...
i'm
reading
to
you
now
from
the
federal
register
27378,
column
2.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
didn't
say
how
many,
didn't
say
how
many.
you
should
know,
you
should
know,
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
marshall,--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--i
say--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--we
could
only
take
the
secretary's
finding.
i
wanted
to
be
true
to
the
finding--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--he
said
some
marginal
employers,
some
marginal
employers--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well,
it
was
based
on
his
analysis
of
this
overall
record--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--he
states
that,
he
states
that--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--my
red
light
is
up.
i
would
just
like
to
say
as
i
leave
the
podium,
that
we
have
addressed
in
detail,
the
comments
of
textile
manufacturing
institute
as
to
the
respirator,
as
to
their
so-called
alternative,
and
we
have
explained
why
it
does
not
provide
the
health
protection
obligations
that
should
be
imposed
here.
thank
you.
