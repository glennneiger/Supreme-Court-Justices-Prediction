mr.
francis
r.
croak
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
there's
any
history
of
pervasive
regulation.
i
don't
think--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
that...
at
least
so
far--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--well,
i
think
camara
and
see
answered
that
question,
though.
those
were
building,
one
was
a
building
inspection,
one
was
a
fire
inspection,
and
the
requirement
there
was
for
warrants.
so
i
think
your
question
really
is
justice
stewart's
question,
can
you
select
an
industry
and
having
selected
an
industry
avoid
the
normal
fourth
amendment
requirements
of
a
warrant?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
see
your
point,
and
you
only
gave
my
friend
here
ten
years
to
worry
about,
but
i
don't
think
the
ten
or
the
25
is
dispositive
of
the
issue.
i
agree
with
him.
the
nuclear
industry
from
day
one.
but,
if
i
may,
let
me
say
that
some
industry,
such
as
nuclear,
the
government
really
started
the
nuclear
industry
and
has
since
day
one.
i
think
that
that's
a
distinguishing
factor
in
that
situation.
i
think
in
this
issue
of
pervasive
regulation,
there
are
some
considerations.
if
you
analyze
the
industries
that
this
court
has
found
to
be
pervasively
regulated,
they
cover
a
broad
spectrum
of
activities
in
within
the
industry.
the
liquor
concerns
are
taxed
going
back
to
the
revolution,
but
after
prohibition
we
enacted
27
u.s.
code,
which
tells
the
distiller
or
the
brewer
what
size,
or
he
has
to
have
a
permit
to
have
a
brewery
or
distillery,
he
has
to...
the
size
bottles
that
he
puts
in,
the
makeup
of
what
he
sells,
is
regulated;
who
he
sells
to
is
regulated.
there's
even
some
regulation
in
there
about
his
pricing
arrangements.
and--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
want
me
to
say
that
you
can
build
a
multistatute
pyramid
which
will
reach
pervasive
regulation,
some
of
it
being
local
regulation,
some
of
it
being
federal,
some--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--i
don't
dispute
that
and
i
don't
imagine
we're
here
today--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--no.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
think
we'd
all
agree
it's
a
fact
and
we
won't
discuss
our
own
particular
views
on
the
wisdom,
but
the
fact
is
that
if
this
approach
is
used,
i
suppose
one
could
fashion
an
argument
that
every
business
in
america
today
is
pervasively
regulated.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
that's
right.
distinguished
from--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--piggyback
on
the
federal,
and
the
federal
on
the
state
or
the
local;
that's
my
argument.
i'm
afraid
there
is
no
litmus
test
for
pervasive
regulations.
there
is
no
one
thing,
i
think,
that
i
agree
that
licensing
is
but
a
factor.
obviously,
this
business
is
not
licensed
nor
has
it
ever
been.
the
other
factors
which
are
important
are
the
statute
itself.
i
think
that
that's
something
that
you
have
to
look
at.
the
peppered...
that
was
a
pervasive...
pardon
the
use
of
the
word...
consideration,
perhaps,
in
colonnade.
and
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
this
particular
industry,
i
think
you
find
that
there
was
really
no
meaningful
federal
regulation
of
this
quarry
until,
really,
1978,
when
the
1977
act
become
effective,
because
the
act
of
1966
merely
established
certain
advisory
standards.
it
provided
that
there
was
really
no
citation
authority
in
the
inspecting
agents;
it
provided
for
one
inspection
a
year,
and
now
we've
gone
to
two...
i
don't
regard
that
change
as
significant.
it
also
provided
that
in
a
very
narrow
area
of
cases
involving
non-coal
mines,
inspectors
could
issue
what
were
known
as
withdrawal
orders,
which
would
have
the
effect
of
a
temporary
shutdown.
the
nature,
if
you
read
those
orders,
it's
hard
to
equate
those
with
a
limestone
quarry,
an
open-pit
limestone
quarry
especially.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
language
of
the
court
in
barlow's
talks
about
a
long
tradition
of
close
governmental
supervision.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there's
no
way
you
can
look
at
this
particular
industry
and
say
there's
a
long
tradition
of
close
governmental
supervision.
i'd
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
think
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
is
to
piggyback
the
long
tradition,
if
you
will,
of
government
control
of
the
coal
mine
by...
because
what
happened
in
1977
was
that
congress
amended
the
coal
act,
did
away
with
the
act
that
affected
us,
the
act
of
'66,
and
incorporated
by
amendment
and
by
definition
everything
that
was
in
the
various
mining
industries
and
brought
them
all
under
the
same
strictures
that
had
controlled
the
coal
industry.
and,
i
don't
challenge
the
wisdom
or
the
right
of
the
congress
to
do
that.
i'm
only
saying
that
that
doesn't
give
the
congress
the
right,
however,
to
do
away
with
the
fourth
amendment
expectations
of
this
particular
industry.
the
other
concern
which
i
have
is
the
argument,
or
the
suggestion
of
an
argument
that
solely
because
of
the
injury
rate,
or
the
dangerousness,
if
you
will,
of
a
particular
industry,
that
this
standing
alone
gives
the
congress
the
right
to
mandate
warrantless
entry.
now,
i
don't
think
any
of
us
are
unsympathetic
with
the
goals
of
government
to
cut
down
injuries,
but
i
think
that
there
is
no
case
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
which
ever
said
that
injury
alone
is
a
justification
for
waiver
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
we
go
that
route
and
start
establishing
those
criteria,
i
suggest
we'll
be
plowing
new
ground,
and
perhaps,
justice
rehnquist,
opening
the
door
for
some
of
the
things
that
you
suggested
by
your
questions.
there
are
certainly
areas
in
american
life
where
everyone
would
agree...
the
congress,
or
us,
or
everyone...
would
agree
that
there
is
a
significant
dangerousness
to
most
of
us
as
citizens,
whether
we
be
workers
involved
or
citizens
exposed
to
certain
hazards.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
if
you're
asking
me,
do
i
see
the
distinction
between
a
completed
and
an
uncompleted
building,
no,
i
don't.
for
constitutional
purposes,
i
don't.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
las
vegas?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
maybe
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
i
have
no
problem
with
the
government
inspecting
the
buildings.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
if
you're
asking
me,
may
government
legislate
to
provide
for
that
inspection?
my
answer
is
yes.
if
you're
asking
me,
may
government
provide
for
warrantless
entry?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
don't
have
any
problem...
i
think,
probably
somewhere
in
osha
there
is
a
provision
which
today
is
permitting
government
inspectors
to
look
at
the
tall
building
that
you
talk
about,
but
as
this
court
said
in
barlow's,
such
an
inspection
requires
a
warrant.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
no,
i
do
not
maintain
that.
the
interesting
thing
is
that,
now
that
i
think
about
it,
i
think
this
is
reflected
in
the
brief
of
one
of
the
amici,
that
that
accident
rate
is
higher
in
the
construction
industry
than
it
is
in
the
surface
mining
industry
which
my
client
is
involved
in.
i
don't
know
whether
it
means
anything
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
think
it's
all
right
because
i
can't
conceive
that
anybody
could
reasonably
argue
that
that's
not
pervasively
regulated.
from
day
one
at
the
university
of
chicago
the
government
has
been
involved
in
the
industry.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
that
it
always
has.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
feel
it's
always
been...
it
was
pervasively
developed
by
government
and
it
is
pervasively--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--i
think
so,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
in
my
view
the
regulation
came
with
the
development
of
the
industry.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
think
my
position
is...
although
i
see
your
point,
what
you're
suggesting,
my
position
remains
that
the
nuclear
industry
is
pervasively
regulated,
however,
but
i
appreciate
your
point.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
that's
correct.
you
can't
even
obtain
some
of
the
materials
necessary
to
generate
nuclear
power,
for
example,
without
obtaining
them
through
licensing.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
but
it
wouldn't
surprise
me
at
all,
and
it
doesn't
offend
me.
i
think
that
government
can
reserve
activities
solely
to
itself.
i
think
that
there
is
one
other
concern
that
i
have
and
that
is
the
government's
argument
that...
and
this
is
kind
of
an
unusual
situation,
the
government
is
telling
us
what's
good
for
us,
and
what's
good
for
us
is
not
to
request
a
warrant
because
there
are
other
provisions
within
the
law
that
will
take
care
of
us
and
we
are
saying
we
don't
want
that,
we
want
the
government
to
get
a
warrant.
it's
kind
of
a
backwards
situation,
if
you
will,
but
if
i
could
discuss
it?
the
government
says
that
the
injunctive
procedures
are
the
equivalent
of
a
warrant.
there
was
language
in
barlow's
talking
about
administrative
warrants
or
their
equivalent.
i
suggest
that
an
injunctive
procedure
is
not
that.
if
one
examines
the
record
in
this
case
the
pleadings
of
the
government
really
allege
that
we
didn't
let
them
in.
and
so
who
did
it
shift
the
burden
to,
then?
the
record
is
clear,
the
solicitor
general
has
advised
the
court,
that
administrative
action
was
commenced
against
us
for
not
letting
them
in,
and
we
were
fined
$1,000.
i
don't
think
that
the
injunctive
procedure
provision
was
probably
even
necessary,
because
if
in
fact
the
government
inspector
had
a
right
to
enter,
i
think
that
there
was
adequate
remedy
in
the
law
as
it
exists
now
for
an
injunctive
procedure
of
some
sort
to
let
him
in,
so
that
by
putting
it
in
the
statute
i
don't
think
that
it
gave
us
any
rights,
any
more
or
less
than
existed
before.
but
the
more
important
thing
is
that
the
hearing
that
one
gets
at
this
time
is,
whether
you
let
us
in
or
not.
and
the
relief
sought
here
was
a
permanent
injunction
against
us
ever
to
keep
government
inspectors
out.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
seriously
stand
here
and
argue
that
one
could
issue
a
permanent
search
warrant
for
the
examination
of
our
premises
or--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--i
know
they
are.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
but
they're
telling
us
that
the
equivalent
of
the
search
warrant
hearing
is
the
hearing
on
injunctive
relief.
and--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes.
i
also
question
the
position
that
the
government
takes
about
the
absence
of
a
provision
for
entry,
when
entry
is
denied.
i
find
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
the
agent
from
forcing
his
way
in.
i
understand
that
it's
the
administrative
policy
of
the
secretary
of
labor
at
the
present
time
to
direct
people
not
to
do
that,
but
there's
nothing
that
you
can
read
that
i
can
read
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
that.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
there
is
a
record
provision
of
the
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept
and
to
be
made
available
to
the
secretary.
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
believe
so.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i'm
sorry?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
customs
people?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
all
right--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--no,
i
think
you're
right.
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
cases
we
rely
on
in
our
brief
is
a
search
without
a
warrant
20
or
30
miles
from
the
border,
so
that
immigration
was
involved
in
almeida-sanchez,
and
this
court
discussed
in
that
case
the--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes.
there's
no
question
about
the
legality
of
border
searches;
that's
right.
i
think
that
some
of
your
questions
have
suggested
to
me
something
which
really
isn't,
perhaps,
directly
discussed
in
the
brief
and
that
is
the
almost,
the
ability,
almost,
to
have
a
piecemeal
disintegration
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
administrative
search
situations,
because
congress
declares,
as
they
did
in
barlow's
and
as
they
do
here,
their
concern,
proper
concern
for
the
safety
of
the
american
worker.
i
think
that
the
government's
position
would
say
that
any
time
they
identify
an
injury-ridden
industry,
that
they
could
say
that...
and
then
pass
some
regulations
that
this
is
pervasively
regulated,
is
a
proper
area
of
congressional
concern.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
accept
biswell;
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
biswell
supports
our
position.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
well--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--no,
i
understand.
biswell
is
important,
i
think,
for
our
point
of
view
because
it
points
out
that
there
are
few
exceptions
to
the
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
a
warrant.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
think
the
public
interest--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--no,
and
the
court
specifically
said
that.
you
specifically
said
that,
that
it
wasn't
a
long
history--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--that's
right.
the
court
did,
and
it
pointed
out,
though,
the
concerns
of
the
public
in
firearms
control,
pointing
to
the--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes.
that's
right.
because
there
was
an
enforcement
entered.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
may
i
answer
this?
mr.
francis
r.
croak
because
the
enforcement
interest,
i
think,
affected
the
entire
public
in
america.
or
at
least
in
the
court's
view
it
did,
where
in
this
case
the
enforcement
interest
really
affects
the
miners.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
yes.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
so
congress
found;
that's
right.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
yes.
our
experience
with
prohibition;
what
have
you.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
interrupted
you.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
there
was
a
license.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
that's
right.
i
don't
say
that
any
one
of
those
things
is
dispositive.
i
say
that
one--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes,
but
this
is
certainly
not
a
consent
case
and
i...
contrary
to
some
suggestions
in
the
government's
brief,
it's
not
an
open
view
case,
it's
not
plain
view,
it's
not
the
alfalfa
case
situation
where
the
inspector
stood
and
watched
the
smoke
come
out
of
the
smokestack.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
well,
it
may
be--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--no,
and
you
can't
see
inside
of
most,
many
open
mines,
because
they're
removed
from
areas
where
the
public--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes,
and
i
don't
have
as
much
trouble
with
the
initial
inspection,
because
that
hinges
on
the
expectation
of
privacy,
which
is
one
of
the
considerations
here.
but
this
mine
has
been
operated
at
this
location
since
the
turn
of
the
century.
and
i
think
that's
different
than
the
case--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--oh,
i
think
that's
true.
but
the
history
of
coal
regulation
and
the
attempts
at
coal
regulation
go
back
to
1911,
as
i
recall.
the
effectiveness
of
some
of
it
might
be
questioned.
obviously,
the
example
the
solicitor
general
gave
of
the
tragedy
was
a
coal
mine
explosion.
i
think
that
government
regulation
of
coal...
i
don't
think
my
case
stands
or
falls
on
the
regulation
of
the
coal
mines.
i
also
point
out
that
if
my
recollection
is
correct
for
several
years,
34
years
ago,
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
the
government
ran
the
coal
industry
in
america.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
i
don't
think
it's
as
much
as
biswell
and
i
would,
if
i
were
defending
the
coal
mine
search...
although
i
realize
i'm
on
the
other
side
here,
i
would
point
to
the
regulation
in
the
national
public
interest
in
coal
as
a
fuel
and
the
energy
problems
and
i
come
back
to
what
i
said,
i
think
there
was
a
'46--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--oh,
and
i
don't
mean
that
health
hazards
aren't
a
consideration,
to
take
it...
there
were
considerations
in
barlow's.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
and
i'm
only
saying
that
if
i
were
defending
coal
i'd
also
point
out
two
years
of...
involving
the
operation
of
the
coal
mining
industry
in
this
country
in
the
'40s
as
an
example
of
the
pervasiveness
of
government
regulation.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
oh,
yes.
and
i
don't
dispute
that
the
enactments
are
motivated
by
a
desire
to
cut
injuries.
that
was
barlow's,
too,
the
concern
was
to
cut
injury.
and
my
only
statement
is
that
i
don't
think
that
standing
alone
that
that's
a
proper
basis
or
criterion,
or
you
will
have
completely
eroded
the
fourth
amendment.
and
also,
then,
we
get
into
a
situation
that
i
don't
think--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
but
really,
i'm
arguing
that
my
case
is
barlow's,
which
is
not
that
old,
and
there's
been
no
change.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
change,
if
anything,
is
it's
a
little
safer
now
than
it
was
three
years
ago,
i
think,
although
there
really
isn't
any
significant
change
since
then.
i'm
saying
that
that
alone
is
not
the
basis,
safety
considerations
alone
are
not
the
basis
to
justify
an
erosion
of
the
normal
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
operator
in
court.
mr.
francis
r.
croak
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes,
it
does.
and
a
long
history
of
regulation
is
only
one
factor,
as
i
said
before.
licensing
is
another
thing.
coal
mines
have
to
be
licensed
as
opposed
to
this
registration
of
the
kind
of
mine
that
we're
operating.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
a
significant
consideration,
but
i
think
you
weigh
all
of
these
things
and
the
problem
i
get
is
this
piecemeal
attacking
of
the
industry
concern,
and--
mr.
francis
r.
croak
--yes.
in
wisconsin
there
is
a
warrant
procedure.
i
would
be
candid,
this
operator
has
never
insisted
it
be
used,
but
it
exists
and
our
reference
is
in
our
brief
to
the
statute,
that
there
is
a
provision.
and
the
government
alluded
to
the
fact
that
this
mine
has
been
inspected
since
1922.
i
think,
in
all
candor,
though,
i
must
say
that
that
inspection...
and
i
think
the
record
bears
me
out
in
this,
was
the
kind
of
inspection
that
you
get
under
the
wisconsin
worker's
compensation
law,
and
i
think
the
testimony
showed
that
the
same
people
that
were
inspecting
the
department
store,
were
inspecting
the
factory,
were
involved
in
mine
inspection,
for
many,
many
years
because
wisconsin
had
a
comprehensive
worker's
compensation
law
that
covered
anybody
that
employed
more
than
two
people.
but
there
is,
as
i
say,
under
that
law
today
there
exists
a
statutory
provision
for
obtaining
what
is
called
an
inspection
warrant.
thank
you.
