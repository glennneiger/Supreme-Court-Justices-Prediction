mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
mine
inspector
is
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
before
conducting
a
routine
safety
and
health
inspection
of
mine
facilities
such
as
stone
quarries
pursuant
to
the
federal
mine
safety
and
health
act
of
1977.
the
four
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
question
have
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
however,
the
district
court
in
this
case
concluded
that
a
warrant
was
required
to
search
appellee's
quarry
and
therefore
declared
the
warrantless
inspection
provisions
of
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
government
has
taken
a
direct
appeal
from
that
ruling.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
stated.
the
appellee,
waukesha
lime
and
stone
company,
operates
a
limestone
quarry
and
mill
facility
in
wisconsin.
the
quarry
consists
of
two
open
pits
that
are
as
deep
as
30
feet
in
some
places.
generally,
about
three
times
a
day
workers
use
explosives
to
dislodge
pieces
of
rock
from
the
wall
of
the
quarry.
the
limestone
is
then
taken
to
a
crushing
facility
where
it
is
crushed
and
sorted
according
to
size,
and
the
stone
is
then
taken
to
a
building
known
as
the
dust
house
where
it
is
dried,
ground,
and
bagged
for
direct
sale
to
customers.
waukesha's
facility
has
been
subject
to
regular
safety
and
health
inspections
by
state
officials
for
about
60
years
and
it
has
been
subject
to
federal
safety
and
health
inspection
since
1966
when
congress
passed
the
predecessor
of
the
federal
mine
safety
and
health
act.
now,
in
april,
1978,
a
federal
mine
inspector
showed
up
at
waukesha's
mine
to
conduct
a
routine
health
and
safety
inspection.
following
the
inspection
he
cited
waukesha
for
25
violations
of
mandatory
health
and
safety
standards.
a
few
months
later
the
same
inspector
showed
up
to
conduct
a
follow-up
inspection
to
determine
whether
waukesha
had
corrected
the
most
serious
of
these
violations,
specifically,
whether
the
airborne
concentrations
of
silica
dust
in
the
dust
house
had
been
lowered.
inhalation
of
excessive
amounts
of
silica
dust
leads
to
a
condition
known
as
silicosis
which
is
a
very
serious
respiratory
disease,
even
more
serious
than
black
lung
disease.
waukesha's
president,
appellee
douglas
dewey,
refused
to
allow
the
inspector
to
undertake
the
follow-up
inspection
without
a
search
warrant.
at
that
point
the
inspector
discontinued
the
inspection
and
issued
a
citation
to
the
company
for
denial
of
entry.
the
citation
was
followed
by
a
proposed
civil
penalty
of
$1,000.
in
addition,
the
secretary
thereafter
brought
this
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
to
enjoin
appellees
from
refusing
to
permit
warrantless
inspections
of
their
quarry
pursuant
to
the
mine
safety
act.
and
as
i
noted
a
moment
ago,
the
district
court
denied
that
injunction
and
instead
held
in
reliance
on
this
court's
decision
in
marshall
v.
barlow's
that
the
act's
warrantless
inspection
provisions
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
if
steagald
were
applicable
to
this
sort
of
case,
the
district
court's
opinion
would
have
a
lot
to
be
said
for
it,
but
we
don't
read
steagald
as
wiping
out
the
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
exemplified
by
cases
such
as
biswell,
for
pervasively
regulated
businesses.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
congress
has
not
attempted
to
pass
that
sort
of
a
statute.
it's
passed
a
statute
which
we
think
is
quite
similar
to
the
statute
that
this
court
upheld
in
biswell,
and
i
don't
recall
that
there
was
anything
in
the
steagald
opinion
which
cast
any
doubt
on
the
continuing
validity
of
biswell,
and
therefore
we
continue
to
rely
on
biswell.
this
is
a
regulatory
search,
for
purposes
of
finding
whether
there
are
health
and
safety
violations
and
not
for
purposes
of
finding
evidence
of
a
crime.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think...
there
are
two
key
cases
that...
of
course,
we
rely
on
colonnade
and
biswell,
and
there's
a
tendency
which
we
have
fallen
into
as
much
as
the
other
party
does,
to
lump
the
two
exceptions
together
in
sort
of
a
colonnade-biswell
exception.
i
think
analytically
there
are
really
two
separate
exceptions.
colonnade,
i
think
dealt
with
a
situation
in
which
there
had
been
an
extremely
long
history
of
pervasive
government
regulation
in
an
area--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--alcoholic
beverages.
in
fact,
it
predated
the
constitution,
government
regulation.
and
the
court
found
in
that
situation
that
congress
could
reasonably
authorize
warrantless
inspections
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
without
any
further
inquiry
having
to
be
made
as
to
the
need
for
warrantless
searches
it's
interesting
to
read
the
court's
opinion.
there's
no
discussion
of
that.
however,
a
couple
of
years
later
in
the
biswell
case,
the
court
confronted
a
situation
in
which
there
hadn't
been
that
long
history--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--firearms.
that's
right.
it
was
the
gun
control
act
of
1968.
the
court
noted
that
there
wasn't
the
same
long
history
of
government
regulation
of
firearms--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
was
a
history,
there
was
current
pervasive
regulation,
and
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
when
you
have
that
sort
of
a
situation,
the
court
will
determine
reasonableness
by
looking
at
the
enforcement
needs
and
privacy
guarantees
of
the
statute.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
was
a
history,
as
there
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
don't
think,
i
think
that
i
have
to
know
more
about
the
situation,
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
if
congress
can,
consistent
with
its
other
constitutional
powers,
move
into
an
area
for
the
purposes
of
regulation,
and
if--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
the
enforcement
needs
of
the
statute
require
warrantless
searches
and
if
there
are
privacy
guarantees
in
the
statute
that
take
the
place
of
a
warrant,
as
there
was
in
biswell
and
as
we
contend
that
there
is
in
this
case...
although
in
this
case
we
also
are
dealing
with
an
industry
which--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
we're
not
talking
here,
first
of
all,
about
any
criminal
enforcement.
we're
talking
about
health
and
safety
inspections,
for
which
this
court
has
said,
routine
warrantless
inspections
are
frequently
necessary
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
that's
certainly
not
the
case
with
criminal
law
enforcement.
and
the
situations,
in
fact,
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
conduct
warrantless
searches
in
order
to
enforce
the
criminal
laws,
the
court
has
recognized
exceptions,
such
as
exigent
circumstances,
even
in
traditional
criminal
law
enforcement
areas.
but
we're
dealing
here
with
an
industry
which
we
submit
has
been
pervasively
regulated
for
many,
many
years
and
therefore
it's
an
even
stronger
situation
in
many
ways
than
the
situation
that
confronted
the
court
in
biswell.
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
view
this
case
as
not
involving
a
long
history
of
regulation
but
simply
a
current
pervasive
regulation,
we
think
the
statute
can
be
upheld
under
the
standard
that
was
announced
in
biswell,
which
requires
looking
into
the
privacy
guarantees
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
real
need
for
a
warrant?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
there
was
an
urgent
federal
interest.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes.
that's
right.
we
don't
think
it
can
be
the
case
that
if
this
case
had
arisen
30
years
from
now
it
might
be
different.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
line
of
cases,
justice
rehnquist,
or
its
relevance
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
think...
let
me
say,
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
length
of
regulation
and
the
pervasiveness
of
regulation
are
relevant
to
what
are
the
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
that
a
person
in
that
industry
may
have.
if
there's
been
a
long
history
of
regulation
for
200
years,
as
there
was
in
colonnade,
then
there
really
can't
be
any
expectation
of
freedom
from
government
inspection.
i
think
for
that
reason
in
colonnade
the
court
didn't
go
any
further
than
saying
that,
didn't
engage
in
any
analysis
as
to
the
need
for
warrantless--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
would
be
nothing
unconstitutional
on
the
face
of
such
a
scheme.
you'd
have
to
inquire
into
what
the
urgent
federal
interest
is,
and
i
said,
you
have
to
inquire
as
to
the
need
for
warrantless
inspections.
there's
not
always
a
need
for
warrantless
inspections
and
when
there
isn't
a
need
then
the
traditional
warrant
requirement
should
certainly
apply.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
in
that
sort
of
a
situation
there's
a
minimal
expectation
of
privacy
and
it's
certainly
reasonable
for
those
sorts
of
inspections
to
take
place.
i
learned
of
another
example
of
a
very
recent
industry
in
which
there
hasn't
been
a
long
history
of
regulation
and
yet
there's
pervasive
government
regulation
and
no
one
has
challenged
the
fact
that
it's
constitutional.
that's
the
nuclear
power
industry,
which
has
not
been
in
existence
for
a
very
long
period
of
time.
you
don't
have
the
long
history
that
you
even
had
in
biswell.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
right,
for
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
at
all.
but
that's
just
one
element,
as
i've
repeated,
of
the
test
that
biswell
sets
up,
as
to
whether
a
statute
is
reasonable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
appellees--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
there
was
a
licensed
gun
dealer
in
that
case.
there
is
no
physical
reason--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
the
same
argument
could
be
made
in
the
mining
industry,
justice
white.
there's
no
piece
of
paper
that
is
labelled
a
license,
but
we
don't
think
that
that's
all
that
significant.
to
begin
with,
every
mine
that's
covered
by
the
mine
safety
act
has
to
register
with
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we're
talking
about
the
non-coal
portion
of
the
mining
industry.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
this
case
involves
stone.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
may
be
some
cases
at
the
fringe.
this
case
involves
a
stone
quarry.
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
that
have
arisen
under
this
statute
involve
stone
quarries
and
gravel
pits.
that's
the
sort
of
situation
that
this
act
was
addressed
to,
where
there
was
a
need
for
further
regulation,
the
non-coal
portion
of
the
mining
industry.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
no.
there
aren't.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
there
are
no
warrants
either
under...
this
act
involves
the
coal
portion
of
the
mining
industry
as
well,
but
neither
these
appellees
nor
any
other
plaintiff
has
chosen
to
attack
that
section
of
the
statute,
presumably
on
the
theory
that
that
portion
of
the
industry
has
been
subject
to
pervasive
government
regulation
even
though--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is,
i
should
say,
is
that
the
distinction
between
coal
and
non-coal
portions
of
the
industry
is
not
coterminous
with
the
distinction
between
underground
and
surface
mines.
fifteen
percent
of
the
miners
in
the
limestone
and
quarry
industry
are
underground,
and
35
percent
of
the
miners
in
the
coal
industry
work
in
surface
mines.
so
there
isn't
the
same--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
is
not.
that's
correct,
although
the
federal
government
only
got
into
the
business
of
regulating
the
non-coal
portions
of
the
industry
in
1966.
but
the
states
had
been
regulating
non-coal
portions
of
the
industry
for
many,
many
decades.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
wisconsin
had
been
regulating
this
quarry
since
1922,
but
other
states
had
gone
back
even
further
than
that.
so
we
think
that
the
test
is
whether
there's
an
urgent
federal
interest,
and
whether
the
privacy,
whether
the
statute
involved
protects
the
privacy
of
the
individual,
and
whether
there's
a
need
for
warrantless
searches.
that
is,
we
think,
what
biswell
says
and
we
think
this
case
falls
under
biswell.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
spend
very
much
time
trying
to
convince
the
court
of
the
urgent
federal
interest
involved
in
frequent
safety
and
health
inspections
of
mine
facilities.
what
i
would
like
to
spend
my
remaining
time
on
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
except
that
we're
dealing
here
with
an
industry
that
congress
found
to
be
among
the
most
hazardous
in
the
nation.
it
deals
with
a
specific
industry
with
an
acknowledged
history
of
safety
and
health
violations.
the
most
dangerous--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
as
to
certain
portions
of
the
industries
that
osha
covered,
but
osha
also
covered
a
lot
of
industries
that
weren't
all
that
dangerous--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
one
of
the
tests
that
biswell
sets
up
is
whether
there's
an
urgent
federal
interest
for
the
warrantless
searches.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
but
i
wouldn't
think
it
could
meet
the
other
parts
of
the
biswell
test,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
now,
i
think
it's
important,
in
trying
to
focus
on
why
there
isn't
the
need
for
a
warrant
in
this
case,
to
look
at
what
the
statutory
protections
are
for
mine
operators
in
order
to
determine
what
further
protection
a
warrant
would
provide.
now,
i
think
the
best
way
to
demonstrate
that
a
warrant
would
be
of
virtually
no
practical
value
in
the
mine
safety
context,
and
would
add
virtually
no
protection
to
these
minimal
privacy
interests
that
we
think
mine
operators
have
in
these
open
pits,
is
to
contrast
mine
inspections
with
the
sorts
of
inspections
that
were
involved
in
the
camara
and
see
cases,
where
the
court
held
that
a
warrant
was
required
for
routine
housing
inspections,
and
in
barlow's,
which
involved
health
inspections
under
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act.
the
court
stated
in
camara
and
it
repeated
in
barlow's
that
a
warrant
would
serve
a
valuable
purpose
in
those
situations
because
it
would
limit
the
unbridled
discretion
of
the
inspector
as
to
when
and
whom
to
search.
the
court
stated,
in
addition,
that
a
warrant
would
assure
the
homeowner
or
the
businessman
that
the
inspection
was
authorized
by
statute,
and
was
conducted
pursuant
to
an
administrative
plan
containing
specific
neutral
criteria,
and
that
it
would
advise
the
owner
of
the
precise
scope
and
objects
of
the
search.
now,
these
points
make
a
great
deal
of
sense,
especially
camara,
but
also
in
the
barlow's
situation,
camara--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
that
the
court
found
that
there
was
not
the
factual
basis
that
the
government
thought
there
was
for
a
need
for
warrantless
inspections
in
the
barlow's
situation.
but
i
think
we
concede
freely
that
barlow's
involved
a
situation
where
six
million
businesses
were
subject
to
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
but
only
about
80,000
businesses
were
searched
every
year.
therefore,
when
an
osha
inspector
up
at
the
door,
the
businessman
really
had
no
reason
to
know
whether
he
properly
was
there,
whether
it
was
in
fact
an
osha
inspector
or
what
were
the
standards
that
we
used
to
pick
that
particular
business,
what
were
the
limits
of
the
search
power
of
the
officer?
i
think
it's
a
totally
different
situation
when
we're
dealing
with
mine
inspectors.
every
mine
subject
to
the
mine
safety
act...
and
that
includes
virtually
every
mine
in
the
nation...
has
to
register
with
the
secretary
of
labor,
has
to
be
familiar
with
all
of
the
health
and
safety
standards
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
labor,
gets
a
copy
of
every
health
and
safety
standard
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
statute
that
regulates
this
industry
sets
forth
a
minimum
number
of
inspections
that
have
to
take
place
every
single
year.
it's
a
minimum
of
two
for
surface
mines
and
four
for
underground
mines.
it's
generally
the
same
inspector
who
shows
up
periodically
every
few
months
to
conduct
the
inspection.
the
inspector
in
this
case
submitted
an
affidavit
saying
that
he
had
been
making
all
of
the
inspections
of
stone
quarries
in
waukesha
county
over
the
previous
five
years.
he
had
been
showing
up
at
this
limestone
quarry
repeatedly
to
make
these
inspections.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
right,
justice
blackmun.
you
have
the
inspector
showing
up
every
few
months.
the
mine
operator
knows
why
he's
there,
he
knows
who
he
is,
knows
what
the
limits
of
his
search
power
are.
the
statute
itself
sets
forth
the
neutral
criteria
that
would
allow
the
search
to
take
place.
one
has
to
ask
what
additional
value
a
warrant
would
provide
in
that
situation?
now,
the
point
of
all
this,
i
think,
is
that
a
warrant
here,
just
as
in
biswell...
and
in
biswell,
i
might
add,
the
court
made
the
same
analysis.
the
court
pointed
out
in
biswell
that
someone
who
engaged
in
a
licensed
business
of
dealing
in
firearms
is
given
a
copy
of
all
the
regulations
that
are
applicable
to
his
business
and
is
told
in
advance
of
what
the
limits
of
the
searching
officer's
powers
are.
and
the
court
said,
we
don't
think
that
the
additional
benefits
that
a
warrant
would
provide
in
that
situation
are
very
meaningful
or
outweigh
the
need
for
frequent,
unannounced
inspections,
which
the
court
found
in
the
biswell
situation
and
we
assert
in
this
case,
congress
found
were
essential
to
accomplishing
of
the
statutory
purpose.
and
the
point
of
all
this
is
that
a
warrant
here,
just
as
in
biswell,
would
tell
the
mine
operator
absolutely
nothing
that
he
doesn't
already
know.
and
because
the
act
contains
legislative
standards
that
would
certainly
satisfy
the
administrative
probable
cause
standard
of
camara
and
barlow's,
we
think
that
mine
inspectors
could
procure
a
warrant
prior
to
these
frequent
routine
inspections
virtually
for
the
asking.
moreover,
mine
inspectors
don't
have
the
unbridled
discretion
under
the
act,
but
are
carefully
limited
by
statute
as
to
who,
when,
and
how
often
they
are
to
search.
it's
therefore
difficult
to
see
how
even
the
minimal
privacy
interests
that
a
mine
operator
might
have
in
these
pits
would
be
benefited
in
any
meaningful
way
by
requiring
resort
to
the
warrant
process.
a
warrant
would
simply
become
an
empty
gesture,
we
think,
under
these
circumstances.
now,
even
though
a
warrantless
context
serves
no
useful
purpose,
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
great
lasting
harm
in
insisting
on
a
warrant
if
the
mine
safety
and
health
enforcement
program
would
not
be
adversely
affected.
but
congress
reasonably
concluded
that
a
warrant
requirement
would
seriously
cut
the
act's
enforcement
objectives
because
of
the
"notorious
ease"...
and
that's
the
phrase
taken
from
the
senate
report...
the
notorious
ease
with
which
many
mine
hazards
may
be
concealed
or
corrected
temporarily
if
an
inspector
has
given
advance
warning
of
an
inspection.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
we
don't
want
to
get
around
the
fourth
amendment.
we
don't
think
it
would
get
around
the
warrant
requirement
because
in
that
sort
of
a
situation
a
warrant
would
still
serve
a
very
valuable
purpose
when
the
inspector
showed
up
at
the
door
to
make
the
inspection.
it
would
tell
the
person
in
the
house
that
he
is
who
he
says
he
is,
he
has
probable
cause
to
make
the
search,
and
it
would
explain
what
the
limits
of
the
search
power
are.
i
think
that
none
of
that
is
applicable
to
the
mine
safety
situation
where
the
mine
operator
knows
full
well
why
the
mine
inspector
is
there
and
what
the
limits
of
the
search
power
are.
so
we
don't
think
that
that
sort
of
a
situation
would
meet
the
test
of
biswell.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am,
but
i
think
that's
just
one
portion
of
the
biswell
test,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
we
think
that
for
a
statute
to
meet
the
biswell
test
it
has
to
satisfy
all
of
these
criteria,
not
just
one.
now,
we
mentioned
one
of
these
particularly
egregious
examples
in
which
unannounced
inspections
would
have
perhaps
saved
some
lives,
in
our
brief.
that's
the
scotia
mine
disaster
which
took
the
lives
of
23
miners
and
three
mine
inspectors
in
1976.
there
the
evidence
showed
after
the
fact
that
the
mine
operator
had
been
moving
certain
brattices
which
controlled
the
amount
of
ventilation
in
the
mine
after
the
inspector
had
left,
but
had
made
it
appear
through
some
sort
of
cosmetic
changes
that
there
had
been
adequate
ventilation.
and
in
fact,
in
this
very
case...
this
is
a
very
useful
example...
what
the
inspector
was
going
back
in
to
see
was
whether
this
quarry
had
controlled
the
level
of
silica
dust
in
the
dust
house.
now,
it
seems
clear
that
if
advance
notice
had
been
given,
such
as
by
showing
up
and
being
refused
entry
until
he
went
back
and
got
a
warrant,
a
quarry
could
well
take
cosmetic
changes
such
as
shutting
down
the
machines
for
awhile
or
opening
up
the
windows
for
awhile
to
make
it
seem
as
if
the
dust
levels
were
lower
than
they
really
are.
of
course,
mine
inspectors
could
try
to
solve
this
problem
by
getting
a
warrant
before
showing
up
in
the
first
place,
but
i
think
that
would
produce
a
massive
administrative
burden.
you
have
1,900
mine
inspectors
who
have
to
make,
by
statute
are
mandated
to
make
a
minimum
number
of
inspections
every
year.
last
year
they
made
more
than
120,000
inspections
of
mine
facilities.
i
see
my
white
light,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
one
or
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
just
speak
for
a
moment
to
what
i
think
is
the
key
question
in
the
case.
certainly
it's
the
key
question
as
posed
by
biswell,
but
it's
not
something
that
i
think
the
appellee
has
addressed.
and
that
is,
if
in
order
to
satisfy
an
urgent
federal
interest
congress
determines
that
warrantless
searches
are
essential,
and
if
the
warrant
requirement
would
not
provide
any
meaningful
additional
protections
to
the
businessman
in
terms
of
either
limiting
discretion
of
the
searching
officer
or
in
giving
the
businessman
information
as
to
why
the
officer
is
there,
why
is
congress's
decision
to
set
up
a
provision
such
as
that
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment?
what
is
the
benefit
of
insisting
on
a
warrant
procedure
under
those
circumstances,
especially
if
it
means
that
the
urgent
federal
interest
can't
be
accomplished?
now,
the
appellee
has
never
identified
what
a
warrant
would
bring
him
in
a
case
like
this.
he's
mentioned
one
thing
in
his
brief.
he
says,
if
there
had
been
a
warrant,
the
inspector
couldn't
have
done
what
he
did
here,
which
is
to
show
up
and
walk
around
our
premises
for
an
hour
without
telling
us
he
was
there.
but
i
think
that
a
warrant
wouldn't
have
done
anything
about
that.
he
could
have
had
a
warrant
and
still
walked
onto
the
premises
and
not
identified
himself
for
an
hour.
by
the
way,
i
should
add
that
the
statute
prohibits
showing
up
without
identifying
yourself
to
the
mine
operator,
who
has
a
right
to
walk
around
with
you.
so
the
statute
provides
that
protection.
in
fact,
the
stoudt's
ferry
case,
which
is
a
case
that
was
decided
by
the
3rd
circuit
under
the
statute,
shows
that
a
warrant
was
really
not
a
meaningful
protection,
but
the
injunction
procedure
under
the
statute
may
well
be.
the
mine
operator
in
stoudt's
ferry
refused
to
let
the
inspector
in
claiming
that
he
had
some
trade
secrets
he
wanted
to
protect.
when
the
secretary
sued
for
an
injunction
the
district
court
molded
the
injunction
to
take
account
of
these
trade
secrets.
but
if
the
inspector
had
simply
gotten
the
warrant,
if
this
court
would
have
decided
that
one
is
necessary,
and
showed
up,
it
wouldn't
have
taken
account
of
any
of
these
trade
secrets.
by
the
way,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
the
statute
does
prohibit
forcible
entries
for
the
same
reason
i
think
the
statute
in
colonnade
did,
because
there's
no
specific
provision
in
there
that
allows
it,
and
the
court
interpreted
the
statute
involved
in
colonnade
as
not
allowing
forcible
entries
unless
congress
specifically
says
so.
here
congress
has
provided
alternative
remedies
when
an
inspector
is
refused
entry.
one
is
the
civil
penalty
and
another
is
the
injunction
proceedings.
and
just
finally,
justice
stewart,
about
the
licensing
requirement,
i
think
the
situation
is
really
no
different
than
it
was
under
the
gun
control
act,
even
though
there
was
a
license
there.
when
the
gun
control
act
was
passed
people
who
were
in
that
business
had
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
that
statute
or
go
out
of
business.
the
same
way
here:
the
secretary
or
whatever
can
shut
down
mines
that
refuse
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
mine
safety
act,
including
this
provision
that
they
comply
with
health
and
safety
standards
and
allow
for
inspections.
people
who
don't
want
to
continue
under
those
circumstances
are
free
to
go
out
of
business
but
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
that
much
difference
whether
there's
a
physical
piece
of
paper
labeled
a
license.
congress
could
easily,
if
that,
if
this
court
finds
that
that's
what
the
defect
in
the
statute
is,
put
in
a
licensing
requirement.
that
wouldn't
change
any
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
