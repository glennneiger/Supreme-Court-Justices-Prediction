chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
donovan
v.
dewey.
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
burger
let
me
try
another
hypothetical
on
you.
suppose,
passing
over
the
problems
of
whether
building
construction
is
in
the
area
of
interstate
commerce,
for
the
moment,
that
on
all
buildings
and
i
suppose
all
commercial
buildings
would
clearly
be
covered,
random
inspections
by
federal
inspectors
during
the
process
of
construction
until
the
building
was
completed.
would
you
think
that's
constitutional?
chief
justice
burger
there
is
such
a
statute
with
respect
to
constructing
bridges,
i
think,
across
any
navigable
stream,
that
federal
inspectors
may
come
on
the
site
and
inspect
it
at
any
time
without
a
warrant.
i
suppose
it's
to
see
whether
the
steel
and
concrete
is
going
to
be
enough
to
hold
the
bridge
up,
so
it
won't
fall
on
the
boats
or
drop
the
people.
chief
justice
burger
what
about
the
coal?
warrants
in
the
inspection
of
coal
mines?
chief
justice
burger
we
had
a
combination
of
cases
four
years
ago
on
that
subject,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
croak--
chief
justice
burger
let
me
put
to
you
at
the
outset
a
question
i
put
to
your
friend.
what
about
the
hypothetical:
congress
after
identifying
building
construction
as
being
within
the
reach
of
federal
legislative
power,
laying
that
aside,
then
decided
that
they
were
going
to
have
inspectors
who
could
come
on
the
on-site
of
any
building
more
than
100
feet
high
at
any
time
during
the
course
of
construction
to
inspect.
let's
make
it
100
so
they
don't
come
into
one-story
houses.
is
that
all
right?
chief
justice
burger
well,
there
is
a
pervasive
degree
of
regulation
at
the
local
level.
chief
justice
burger
and
it
is
random,
it
is
random
inspection
by
building
inspectors.
i
don't
know
that
100
feet
is
the
limit
but
tall
buildings
always
have
random
inspections
during
construction.
now
that's
pervasive
throughout
the
country,
municipal,
sometimes
the
state.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
history
of
local
inspection
of
buildings
is
at
least
100
years
old,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
isn't
that
pervasive?
chief
justice
burger
well
but
the
history
of
this
country
is
that
a
great
deal
of
regulation
that
once
was
considered
entirely
local
has,
as
you
well
know,
in
the
last
40
years
become
pretty
much
federalized;
maybe
even
more
than
40.
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
arguing
in
favor
of
it.
chief
justice
burger
i'm
just
observing
the
history
of
the
fact.
chief
justice
burger
--i
just
took
another
look
at
camara,
which
you
seem
to
rely
on,
mr.
croak,
and
that
didn't
involve
the
building
inspection
while
a
tall
building
was
in
the
process
of
being
constructed.
that
was
an
occupied
ground-floor
area.
do
you
think
that
controls
anything?
chief
justice
burger
suppose
congress,
after
holding
some
hearings,
recited
the
great
incidence
of
the
fires
out
in
the
gambling
town
out
west
somewhere...
i
forget
the
name
of
the
town.
chief
justice
burger
las
vegas.
and
there
have
been
three
or
four
of
those.
and
then
went
on
to
show
the
loss
of
life
and
went
on
to
show
the
failure
to
have
adequate
safety
provisions
in
those
buildings,
complying
with
requirements,
and
then
cited
all
of
the
cases...
and
there
are
quite
a
few
of
them...
of
buildings
collapsing
during
the
process
of
construction,
with
three,
four,
five,
twenty
people,
workmen,
getting
killed.
do
you
say
they
could
not
legislate
for
random
inspection
of
buildings
in
process
of
construction
if
that
hazard
existed?
chief
justice
burger
random
inspection
of
the
building
while
it's
under
construction
to
see
that
they're
using
the
proper
amount
of
cement,
the
proper
sealed
structure,
in
compliance
with
prescribed
standards,
and
fire
safety
provisions,
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
burger
yes,
random.
chief
justice
burger
random
inspection.
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
your
view
of
the
matter
that
that
is
a
federalism
proposition,
or
view,
that
that's
a
matter
of
local
and
state
government--
chief
justice
burger
the
question
was
whether
it
was
or
was
not
a
border
search.
chief
justice
burger
then
you
distinguish
colonnade
on
the
ground
that
it
was
the
long
history
of
pervasive
regulation
of
the
grog
shops
and
the
liquor
business
generally?
chief
justice
burger
at
the
turn
of
the
century
they
didn't
know
much
about
black
lung
and
brown
lung,
or
if
they
did
they
tolerated
it.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
burger
before
they
began
coal
mine
inspections,
it
was
near
the
turn
of
the
century,
there
probably
was
a
history
of
illness,
disease,
injury,
explosions,
and
what
not
that
led
to
those
enactments.
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
always...
isn't
the
fulcrum
of
the
fourth
amendment
"reasonable",
"unreasonable",
or
"reasonable"?
chief
justice
burger
so
what
might
have
been
unreasonable
at
one
time...
our
cases
have
said
that...
determines
reasonable
or
the
reverse
of
that
proposition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
