do
you
think
for
the
biswell
doctrine
to
apply
that
pervasive
regulation
is
sufficient?
or
must
there
be
a
long...
whatever
"long"
means...
history
of
pervasive
regulation?
justice
stewart
that
was
of
alcoholic
beverages?
justice
stewart
and
that
involved
commercial
traffic
in
firearms?
justice
stewart
there
was
a
history,
and
it
was
pervasive.
justice
stewart
well,
what's
that
kind
of
a
situation?
there
was
a
history,
wasn't
there?
justice
stewart
and,
in
other
words,
do
you
think
congress
could
enact
legislation
today,
pervasively
regulating
a
certain
element
of
industry
and
providing
for
inspections
and
searches
and
seizures
without
a
warrant?
and
if
it
could
not,
would
that
provision
become
constitutional
ten
years
from
now?
justice
stewart
and
if
the
regulation
is
pervasive
enough,
it
can
provide
for
warrantless
searches
and
seizures
without
violating
the
constitution,
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
of
course,
my
brother
rehnquist
would
suggest
that
the
police
would
always
say
that
their
enforcement
needs
require
them
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
stewart
so,
in
other
words,
your
answer
to
my
hypothetical
case
of
congress
enacting
a
statute
pervasively
regulating
an
industry
and
providing
for
the
warrantless
searches
and
seizures
of
elements
in
that
industry
without
securing
a
warrant,
if
there
was
a
showing
that
there
was
a
need
to
do
so--
justice
stewart
--there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation.
right,
today,
the
day
the
statute's
enacted.
justice
stewart
they
involve
compulsory
self-incrimination,
those
cases.
supposing
the
government
for
100
years
has
pervasively
regulated
gambling?
justice
stewart
of
course,
your
expectation
of
privacy,
that's
kind
of
a
circular
argument.
if
congress
today
enacts
a
statute
pervasively
regulating
an
industry
and
you're
an
element
in
that
industry
and
if
that
legislation
provides
for
the
warrantless
inspections
of
elements
of
that
industry,
then
if
the
statute's
valid,
you've
lost
your
expectation
of
privacy.
justice
stewart
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
no
standing
to
attack
it.
justice
stewart
but
there
has
historically
been
pervasive
regulation
of
the
coal
mining
industry.
justice
stewart
and
at
least
in
this
case
there's
no
attack
upon
warrantless
searches
provided
by
the
statute
of
coal
mines.
justice
stewart
particularly
this
state
of
this
particular
entity.
justice
stewart
but
under
your
argument,
it
wouldn't
be
valid
the
day
the
legislation
was
enacted
but
it
might
be
valid
25
years
later.
by
then
you'd
have
25
years
of
history.
justice
stewart
your
argument
is
that
the
history
of
pervasive
regulation
has
to
be
regulation
by
the
jurisdiction
that
is
now
asserting
the
right
to
search
and
seize
without
a
warrant?
justice
stewart
in
order
to
come
under
the
biswell--
justice
stewart
do
you
think
there
was
some
other
attack
in
biswell?
justice
stewart
yes.
justice
stewart
and
is
measured
by
the
extent
of
the
danger
to
the
miners?
justice
stewart
well,
it
was
really
the
same
question.
in
biswell
there
was
a
license
required
to
go
into
the
business--
justice
stewart
--and
it
could
be
argued
at
least
that
in
applying
for
the
license
the
proprietor
of
the
gun
shop
accepted
the
conditions
of
the
license
and
therefore
in
effect
consented
to
the
warrantless
searches?
justice
stewart
a
consent
would
be
dispositive?
