i
suppose
there's
a
greater
privacy
interest
in
a
coal
mine
than
there
is
in
a
big
open
pit,
isn't
there?
a
little
harder
to
see
inside
it?
justice
stevens
the
federal
interest
is
precisely
the
same
as
in
osha,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
it's
precisely
the
same
federal
interest
as
was
present
in
the
osha
case?
justice
stevens
in
osha
they
found
a
history
of
all
sorts
of
dangerous
things
that
justified
the
same
program.
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
is,
there's
a
constitutional
distinction
between
something
that's
very
dangerous
and
something
that's
just
pretty
dangerous?
justice
stevens
that's
exactly
what
the
government
is
arguing.
justice
stevens
the
statute
is
a
permanent
search
warrant.
justice
stevens
they
really
don't
even
need
that,
if
they're
right
under
the
statute;
that
the
statute
itself
is
a
permanent
authorization
to
go
in
without
notice
or
without--
justice
stevens
--mr.
croak,
just
as
a
matter
of
information,
is
there
anything
in
this
statute...
and
perhaps
i
should
know
from
the
papers,
that
talks
about
inspecting
records.
or
are
we
only
talking
about
inspection
of
physical
premises?
justice
stevens
well,
can
they
make...
if
they
win
this
case,
will
they
be
able
to
not
only
come
in
and
look
around
and
test
the
amount
of
dust
in
the
air
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
also
can
they
say,
we
want
to
see
your
records
for
the
last
three
weeks
of
how
much
dust
your
own
tests
showed
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
stevens
they
could
do
that.
