justice
white
mr.
geller,
to
what
extent
is
the
requirement
of
a
license
relevant
in
these
cases?
of
course,
that
isn't
so
here,
i
take
it.
justice
white
it
was
in
the
gun
case.
justice
white
you
could
either
agree
to
a
search
in
advance
or
you
don't
get
a
license?
justice
white
by
the
way,
are
we
talking
here
about
the
stone
quarry
business
or
all
mines?
justice
white
so
all
non-coal
mines
you're
talking
about,
not
just
stones?
justice
white
not
just
the
ones
that
perhaps
would
be
where
your
enforcement
needs
to
be
very
great
because
the
danger
to
health
is
very
great.
there
are
some
mines
that
qualify
as
mines
that
aren't
all
that
dangerous.
justice
white
well,
the
government
didn't
think
so
in
barlow.
justice
white
well,
if
they
sent
a
new
guy
maybe
they'd
let
him
in.
this
comes
close
to
a
bank
examiner
situation,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
turned
the
trick
in
biswell?
do
you
accept
biswell?
justice
white
in
what
respect?
justice
white
it
can't
support
both
sides.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
turned
the
trick
in
biswell,
that
a
warrantless
search
would
be
all
right?
justice
white
there
wasn't
a
long
history
of
regulation.
justice
white
the
court
did;
yes.
justice
white
so
the
interest,
then,
the
enforcement
interest
turned
the
trick?
justice
white
well,
suppose,
suppose
this
was
a
coal
mine
case,
and
we
decided
that
warrantless
inspection
is
all
right.
would
it,
wouldn't
you
expect
it
to
just
rest
on
the
strength
of
the
enforcement
interest
in
the
sense
that
hazard
to
the
miners,
and
the
necessity
of
saving
lives,
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
search,
is
that...
that's
sort
of
biswell,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
know,
you
might
help
solve
the
energy
problem
by
staying
out
of
the
hair
of
the
miners,
and
let
them
go
without
any
inspections
at
all,
but
if
you
were
going
to
defend
the
warrantless
inspection
of
coal
mines,
you
would
have
to
get
to
the
health
hazards
sooner
or
later.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
enough
then
to
sustain
the
coal
mine
inspection,
warrantless
coal
mine
inspection?
justice
white
do
you
think
you
have
to
add
a
long
history
of
regulation?
but
that
just
goes,
that
goes
to
expectations
of
privacy,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
have
the
states...
have
the
states
inspected
premises
like
these
for
quite
a
while
or
not?
