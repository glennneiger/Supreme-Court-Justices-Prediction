--well,
how
about,
once
again,
the
nuclear.
that's
okay?
justice
marshall
well,
is
it
because
it's
always
been,
or
that
it
is
now?
justice
marshall
i
for
one
am
not
too
worried
about
lives
20
years
ago.
i'm
worried
about
lives
today.
justice
marshall
the
first
year,
was
it
okay?
the
first
year
that
it
was
regulated,
was
that
okay?
justice
marshall
well,
if
that's
the
point,
it
has
to
go
along
with
it,
we
can
never
learn?
is
that
your
position?
justice
marshall
yes,
you've
got
a
problem;
you've
got
a
problem.
you
can
run
mines
and
build
buildings
without
the
permission
of
the
federal
government
but
you
can't
engage
in
the
nuclear
power
business
except
on
a
license
from
what
was
formerly
the
atomic
energy
commission,
is
that
not
so?
justice
marshall
on
your
permanent
search
warrant,
there
are
some.
isn't
there
one
the
customs
people
have?
justice
marshall
yes.
there
are
permanent
search
warrants.
provided
for--
justice
marshall
--i
think
so,
i'm
not
sure.
justice
marshall
i
think
you
are
making
the
difference
between
an
open
mine
and
a
closed
mine.
why
does
it
make
any
difference
there?
justice
marshall
well,
i
mean,
you
can't
see
inside
of
a
closed
mine?
justice
marshall
don't
say
that
to
me,
because
i
might
be
tempted
to
feel
that
you
can't
see
it
because
of
the
dust.
to
pursue
one
of
justice
marshall's
earlier
questions
on
this
duration
of
the
tradition,
of
the
pervasiveness,
before
we
had
elevators
in
buildings
there
wasn't
any
need
to
have
random
inspection
of
elevators
and
elevator
shafts,
and
then
elevators
which
made
possible
high-rise
buildings,
because
without
elevators
they
couldn't
have
had
them.
they
had
to
begin
somewhere,
with
random
inspections
of
elevators,
did
they
not?
