justice
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
you're
doubtless
familiar
with
the
steagald
case
that
this
court
decided
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
where
it
said
that
law
enforcement
officers,
even
though
they
possess
an
arrest
warrant,
could
not
go
into
the
house
of
a
third
person
to
seize
the
person
for
whom
they
had
the
warrant.
now,
certainly
crime
has
been
a
heavily
regulated
business
in
the
last
50
or
60
years
just
like
mining.
if
one
were
to
apply
steagald
to
this
type
of
case,
don't
you
think
the
district
court's
opinion
probably
has
something
to
be
said
for
it?
justice
rehnquist
what
about
a
pervasively
regulated
business
like
organized
crime?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
kahriger
was
rightly
decided
and
coin
and
currency
was
wrongly
decided?
the
pervasive
federal
regulation
of
gambling
that
was
upheld
in
345
or
whatever
u.s.
and
that
was
subsequently
overruled
in
390
or
395
u.s.,
those
cases
were
simply
topsy-turvy?
justice
rehnquist
does
that
make
any
sort
of
warrantless
inspection
of
a
nightclub
that
might
be
thought
to
be
carrying
on
gambling?
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
there's
an
urgent
federal
interest
in
the
apprehension
of
felons?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
congress
had
endowed
the
drug
enforcement
administration
with
the
same
sort
of
power
saying
that
it's
notoriously
easy
to
flush
drugs
down
the
toilet
and
therefore
you're
entitled
to
perform
a
maximum
of
12
warrantless
searches
of
disco
dancing
places
every
year?
do
you
think
that
would
get
around
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
arguing
now
about
the
congressional
finding
of
urgency
and
necessity
to--
justice
rehnquist
at
one
time
there
was
a
statutory
prohibition
against
any
private
individuals
even
engaging
in
the
nuclear
power
industry,
wasn't
there,
before
1954?
