mr.
ronald
yank
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
thirty
years
ago
was
the
last
time
this
court
had
the
opportunity
in
a
constitutional
contest
to
consider
the
issue
of
reverse
discrimination
in
employment.
at
that
time
this
court
and
the
california
supreme
court
agreed
that
a
group
could
not
force
upon
an
employer
the
premise
that
that
employer
had
to
have
a
particular
racial
composition
of
that
employer's
work
force
which
would
match
the
service
population.
then
too
the
court
was
looking
at
a
case
from
california.
the
case
was
hughes
v.
superior
court
of
california,
339
u.s.
460.
and
at
that
time
the
employer
was
lucky
stores,
and
it
was
an
attempt
to
have
lucky's
have
its
store
in
richmond,
california,
have
its
work
force
mirror
the
racial
composition
of
the
people
who
shop
there,
in
richmond,
california.
and
this
court,
and
the
california
supreme
court,
sustained
a
permanent
injunction
declaring
at
that
time
that
such
a
goal
of
requiring
such
mirroring
was
an
unlawful
purpose
as
articulated
under
california
law.
why,
then,
30
years
later
are
we
back?
the
reason
that
we
are
back
obviously
has
to
do
with
the
intervening
events
of
the
past
decades,
intervening
struggles
that
counsel
on
both
sides
of
the
case
here
agree
with,
and
support.
what
has
come
out
of
the
struggles
of
the
intervening
years,
of
these
intervening
decades,
has
been
a
strategy
of
how
to
indeed
achieve
the
results
we
all
want
to
see,
which
is
to
see
people
judged
without
regard
to
their
race
or
color
but
simply
with
regard
to
their
abilities.
before
you
is
a
strategy
of
how
to
get
there
which
petitioners
feel
in
fact
is
a
step
away
from
the
society,
from
the
goals
that
we
all
want
to
see.
what
we
have
before
you
is
the
result
of
a
strategy
of
social
engineering
wherein
the
california
department
of
corrections
has
attempted
to
have
its
work
force
mirror
racially
the
inmate
population
or
service
population
of
the
department.
justice
skelly
wright
in
a
recent
law
review
article
in
the
university
of
chicago
law
review
has
challenged
those
of
us
who
oppose
reverse
discrimination
saying
that
we
talk
in
only
abstract
principles,
but
we
don't
get
down
to
talking
about
social
realities
and,
indeed,
the
facts.
i
want
to
take
on
that
challenge
and
speak
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
case
before
you
is
not
about
remedying
prior
discrimination.
that
is
not
this
case.
in
1974
when
the
department
adopted
its
affirmative
action
program
and
then
started
to
carry
it
out
as
we
had
described,
in
fact,
black
persons
were
over-represented
in
the
work
force
of
the
department
of
corrections,
as
were
orientals
and
as
were
people
who
would
be
called
"others".
this
was
not
a
lily-white
work
force.
this
was
indeed
an
integrated
work
force.
there
has
never
been
the
slightest
hint
in
the
record
that
there
was
not
already
sufficient
minorities
and
women
throughout
the
department
to
handle
any
sorts
of
peculiar
or
specialized
assignments
that
the
department
somehow
requires.
the
program
here
was
carried
out
not
by
low-level
people
who
somehow
misunderstood
the
goals
and
objectives
of
the
department.
it
was
carried
out
at
the
direction,
and
indeed
the
energetic
behest
of
top
management.
top
management
said
that
the
goals
would
be
met
"or
else".
it's
the
director
of
the
department
talking.
the
director
stated
that
if
goals
were
not
met,
"their
own
positions
might
be
on
the
line.
"
on
this
record
any
distinction
between
supposed
goals
and
quotas
is
an
illusory
distinction.
mr.
ronald
yank
absolutely
wrong,
your
honor.
it
definitely
involves
new
hires.
mr.
ronald
yank
they
were
promotional
people.
mr.
ronald
yank
no,
because
in
fact
this
action
was
brought
on
behalf,
as
a
class
action,
of
all
people
similarly
situated
by
both
minnick,
darden,
and
by
the
association.
and
indeed,
the
evidence
was
voluminous
that
the
policies
being
implemented
went
also
to
the
question
of
hiring.
for
example,
people
who
applied
for
jobs
had
their
races
secretly
coded
on
their
application
forms
at
the
behest
of
the
department.
people
who
were
not
minorities
or
in
the
favored
group
literally
were
not
considered
for
certain
positions.
mr.
ronald
yank
standing,
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
eligibility.
they
indeed
met
the
requirements
of
people
seeking
the
job.
mr.
ronald
yank
they
were
not
in
the
top
three
bands,
and
i
do
quarrel--
mr.
ronald
yank
--i
do
quarrel
with
the
notion,
"eligible".
mr.
ronald
yank
they
were
not
reachable
within
the
rule-of-three
at
the
time.
however,
moving
on
to
what
i
gather
to
be
the
thrust
of
your
question,
the
program
that
was
described
here
was
one
that
was
going
on
statewide
and
was
going
on
and
will
continue
to
go
on
in
the
future.
minnick
and
darden
will
be
seeking
other
promotions,
as
will
caucasians
and
males
throughout
the
rest
of
the
department.
this
case
was
brought,
not
dealing
with
just
those
two
promotions,
but
there
was
evidence
dealing
with
promotions
on
a
statewide
basis
at
all
kinds
of
levels,
and
not
only--
and
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
trial
court
specifically
state
that
minnick
and
darden
as
to
future
promotions
will
be
disadvantaged,
and
that
caucasians
and
males
in
general
throughout
the
department
will
be
disadvantaged
with
regard
to
future
promotions.
furthermore,
the
organization,
ccoa
itself,
clearly
has
standing
to
bring
this
action
on
behalf
of
any
of
its
members
threatened
with
future
or
prospective
injury
as
the
result
of
the
actions
of
the
department.
this
suit,
really,
your
honor,
was
one
seeking
prospective
injunctive
relief.
we
never
sought
to
void
a
past
appointment
of
any
person,
figuring
that
they
in
one
way
were
innocent
victims
of
the
department's
policies
as
well
as
caucasians.
we
were
seeking
prospective
injunctive
relief.
minnick,
darden,
and
the
association
clearly
had
that
standing.
we
also
had,
i
think,
five
plaintiffs--
mr.
ronald
yank
--the
trial
court
found
that
they--
mr.
ronald
yank
--as
to
any
future
promotions,
i
don't
believe
that
the
appellate
court
denies
that
they
might
be
seeking
future
promotion.
the
specific
findings
of
fact
to
the
trial
court,
which
had
plenty
of
substantial
evidence
to
support
them,
should
have
been
binding
upon
the
court
of
appeal
and
any
appellate
court.
and
it's
those
findings,
i
think,
to
which
we
must
look.
mr.
ronald
yank
why,
i
am
suggesting
that
this
court
in
the
past
has
imbued,
articulated
precisely
that
rule.
in
ward
v.
sullivan
for
example,
this
court
stated
that
an
employee
organization
or
an
association
may
bring
an
action
if
it
can
show
that
any
one
of
its
members
suffered
damage,
or
any
one
of
its
members
himself
or
herself
would
have
standing
before
the
court
to
bring
the
action.
if
there's
anything
that's
clear
from
this
record
it's
that
this
is
indeed
a
case
in
controversy.
we
could
have
had
correctional
officers
taking
numbers
and
standing
up
in
line
outside
the
courtroom,
to
come
in
and
testify.
we
had
five
people
who
testified
who
said
that
they
were
willing
to
have
the
complaint
be
amended
to
name
them
specifically
as
plaintiffs.
i
do
believe
that
ccoa
alone,
had
it
brought
the
case,
would
meet
the
standards
of
case
or
controversy
as
articulated
by
this
court
in
ward
v.
sullivan
and
also
ali
v.
medrano.
mr.
ronald
yank
i
would
think
it
is.
mr.
ronald
yank
well,
i
think
the
court
does
know
the
facts.
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
are
very
clear
in
this
regard.
first
of
all,
the
matter
was
not
briefed
at
all
in
the
court
below.
it
wasn't
discussed
in
oral
argument.
i
don't
think--
mr.
ronald
yank
--well,
that
says,
if
the
case
is
to
be
retried.
again
the
matter...
literally,
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
to
the
court,
plus
the
california
cases,
the
professional
firefighters
and
iaff,
were
never
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeal.
that
is
dicta,
it
wasn't
briefed
at
all,
and
of
course
it
is
for
this
court
on
the
facts
and
the
findings
of
fact
as
presented
by
the
trial
court,
to
determine
whether
indeed
caucasians
and
males
were
being
threatened
by
the
action
of
the
department,
whether
they
had
suffered
in
the
past.
mr.
ronald
yank
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
yank
well,
again,
i
think
that
it's
a
matter
for
this
court
to
determine
whether,
under
your
standards,
there
is
indeed
a
justiciable
issue
here.
mr.
ronald
yank
i
think
again,
it's
clear
under
the
california
case--
mr.
ronald
yank
--i
don't--
mr.
ronald
yank
--no,
again,
we're
here
under
the
14th
amendment.
we
could
be...
i
believe
the
standards
that
apply
here
are
not
the
state
court's
standards
concerning
standing
which--
mr.
ronald
yank
--well,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeal
said
without
briefing,
but
i
do
think
that
the
cases,
the
california
cases
that
we
cited--
mr.
ronald
yank
--could
be,
but
it
does
not
require
any
remand,
because
the
facts
concerning
the
standing
are
there.
so
you
may
indeed
want
to
review
the
california
cases
that
we've
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
ronald
yank
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
possible.
one,
again.
i--
mr.
ronald
yank
--ccoa
would
have
it.
but,
number
two,
if
necessary,
we
could
have
brought
in
dozens
of
people
beyond
the
five
witnesses
who
were
not
named
claimants
who
said--
mr.
ronald
yank
--in
the
record
that
they
were
willing
to
become.
mr.
ronald
yank
they
are
eligible
for
future
promotions
as
was
found
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
ronald
yank
it
really
is
not
an
attack
on
the--
mr.
ronald
yank
--yes.
mr.
ronald
yank
it
was
amended
once
in
'75
and
then
again
in
'79,
and
indeed
has
been
lodged
by
the
court.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
the
strategy
and
tactics,
if
you
will,
of
the
department
has
changed.
and
indeed,
the
department,
subsequent,
for
example,
to
the
preliminary
injunction
in
the
case,
went
out
and
violated
the
order
of
the
court.
and,
of
course,
as
you
know,
there
was
literally
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
department
and
its
top
officials
should
be
held
in
contempt.
the
text
of
the
program
is
not
on
its
face
unconstitutional.
it
is
that
program
as
amended
in
'75
and
again
in
'79,
as
implemented,
that
we
are
attacking
here.
mr.
ronald
yank
it's
lodged
with
this
court.
mr.
ronald
yank
no,
because
the
trial
occurred
prior
thereto.
i
would
agree
that
this
court
has
before
it
a
particular
set
of
actions
by
a
department.
the
situation
might
be
a
little
bit
like
washington
v.
davis,
where
this
court,
even
though
it
knew
that
other
tests
were
being
considered
by
the
district
of
columbia,
refused
to
remand
even
though
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
civil
service
commission
who
won
the
case
were
urging
a
remand
back
to
the
trial
court
for
a
review
of
how
the
test
and
its
procedures
were
working.
this
court
said
it
had
before
it
a
test
and
certain
facts
and
it
was
going
to
decide
that
case.
i
suggest
that
you
have
before
you
a
certain
plan
and
certain
facts
and
that
it's
appropriate
to--
mr.
ronald
yank
--not
a
bit.
and
indeed,
they
reaffirm,
they
reaffirm
explicitly
that
even
though
leaa
changed
its
regs.
so
as
to
not
set
as
goals
the
"service
population",
nonetheless
the
california
department
of
corrections
reaffirmed
that
it
was
having
as
its
goals
the
inmate
population.
so,
if
anything,
it's
more
emphatic
as
to
what
the
social
engineering
goals
of
this
plan
are
as
we
stand
and
sit
here
today.
in
the
record
in
this
case,
obviously
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
explicit
set-aside,
and
the
fact
that
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
department's
only
witnesses,
the
department
acknowledged
that
it
was
hiring,
was
promoting
lesser
qualified
people.
that
is
to
say,
if
people
were
somehow
within
a
reasonable
range
of
qualifications,
no
matter
whether
the
caucasian
was
more
qualified,
the
minority
would
get
the
job.
i
suggest
that
that
situation
is
similar
to
the
one
described
by
justice
powell
in
the
decision
in
arlington
heights.
justice
powell
did
not
use
the
term,
"but
for
causation",
although
we
have
used
it
in
our
brief.
but
in
arlington
heights,
justice
powell
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
made
it
clear
that
if
without
the
tainted
or
improper
motivation
the
decision
would
have
been
different,
then
the
act
of
the
public
entity
should
be
illegal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
the
court
said
that
if
the
plaintiff
could
show
any
improper
aspects
of
the
decision-making
process...
here
it
would
be
consideration
of
race...
the
burden
shifted
to
the
defendants.
the
burden
shifted
to
the
defendants
to
prove
that
without
the
improper
motive
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same.
here
by
testimony
of
the
department's
own
top
management,
the
department
acknowledges
that
the
improper
motive,
the
consideration
of
race,
is
the
changing
factor,
the
"but-for"
factor
that
puts
a
woman
or
a
minority
ahead
of
the
caucasian
or
the
male.
mr.
ronald
yank
i
think
not.
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
purely
local
state
law
as
to
who
had
access
to
their
courts.
mr.
ronald
yank
actually,
i
think
i'm
incorrect
on
that.
i
believe
that,
indeed,
this
court
in
examining
federal
statutes
has
mandated
that
state
courts
indeed
provide
a
cause
of
action
under
federal
statutes,
and
indeed,
in
a
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
the
michigan
law
review...
i
think
it's
'75,
not
'76,
michigan
law
review,
indeed
sets
forth
those
cases.
so
i
would
say
that
indeed
this
court
could
reverse
a
dismissal
of
a
state
court
saying
there
was
no
standing,
if
this
court
found
that
the
federal
standards
had
been
met.
and
of
course
we
were
dealing
with,
as
we
are
here,
a
constitutional
claim.
given
the
facts
of
the
set-asides
and,
really,
the
"but-for"
causation
involving
use
of
race
leading
to
promotions
and
hiring,
what
one
also
sees
in
this
record
is
that
it
is
possible
the
benefit
here
is
a
multi-edged
sword,
that
it
is
not
operating
necessarily
to
the
benefit
of
the
classes
that
supposedly
are
to
benefit.
there's
evidence
in
this
record
that
not
every
correctional
officer
or
minority
correctional
officer
wishes
to
consider
himself
or
herself
a
specialist
in
dealing
with
members
of
his
own
race.
there's
evidence
of
this
record
that
one
minority
group
and
a
member
thereof,
a
high-ranking
management
person,
was
using
his
power
and
influence
to
cut
back
on
the
promotions
of
another
minority
group,
feeling
that
his
minority
group
wasn't
getting
enough
of
the
promotions
in
question.
mr.
ronald
yank
okay.
we
are
here
both
under
the
fourteenth--
mr.
ronald
yank
--our
primary
cause
of
action
here
is
indeed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
having--
mr.
ronald
yank
--absolutely.
we
are
here
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
arguing
that
we
have
here
a
suspect
classification.
it
requires
strict
scrutiny
and
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
in
no
way
come
close
to
meeting
the
standards
of
strict
scrutiny.
and
that
is
the
primary
thrust
of
our
case.
we
have
also
brought
the
action
as
a
title
vii
action,
but
we
recognize
we
are
swimming
upstream
against
weber,
although
we
did
invite
the
court's
attention--
mr.
ronald
yank
--which
is
also
bound--
mr.
ronald
yank
--absolutely.
absolutely.
and
what
we--
mr.
ronald
yank
--what
we
are
looking
at
here
is
a
question
of
whether
a
government,
be
it
a
state
or
a
city
or
county
can
tell
its
citizens,
even
though...
sir,
madam...
you
were
the
most
qualified
person
for
the
job,
you
didn't
get
it
because
of
your
race
or
sex.
and
to
do
that
in
the
face
of
our
constitution
requires
strong,
strong
compulsion
indeed,
and
all
of
this
court's
cases
and
other
courts'
cases
about
prior
discrimination
and
remedying
same
are
inapplicable
because
this
plan,
in
its
text,
in
'74,
'75,
it
never
mentioned
such
a
thing.
it
never
mentioned,
for
that
matter,
the
so-called
"operational
necessity
of
defense".
what
has
happened
is
that
the
defendants
have
scurried
around
making
arguments
for
the
very
first
time
at
appellate
levels,
including
for
the
very
first
time
in
this
court,
that
their
action
is
somehow
justified
or
valid.
they
cite,
for
example,
recently,
in
materials
that
were
lodged
with
the
court,
supposed
legislative
statutes
or
findings
that
somehow
required
this
action.
and
yet,
if
you
read
those
legislative
materials
and
committee
hearings
rather
closely,
you
will
see
no
mention
or
requirement
that
the
states
or
their
agencies
were
to
somehow
be
granting
preferential
treatment
to
anybody.
those
materials
talked
of
equality
and
equal
employment
opportunity,
not
preferential
treatment.
mr.
ronald
yank
certainly.
mr.
ronald
yank
absolutely.
we
have
made
our
best
case.
we
have
been
told
that
on
the,
i
think,
fairly
skimpy
facts
before
the
court
of
appeal,
that
nonetheless
there
is
an
operational
necessity
justification
under
strict
scrutiny
already
presented,
and
we
lose,
and
we
have
lost
on
that
issue.
anything
that
comes
in
about
supposed
past
discrimination
is
only
frosting
on
the
cake
of
the
defendants.
they
have
won
this
case.
mr.
ronald
yank
not
always.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
judgment
just
saying
"reversed"
and
indeed
mentioning
the
fact--
mr.
ronald
yank
--it
is
a
factual
question,
and
here's
why.
that
is,
court
of
appeal
had
before
it
the
operational
necessity
defense
facts
brought
forward.
it
said,
that's
enough,
right
there.
not,
incidentally,
just
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
under
title
vii.
they
said,
weber
is
dispositive
and
that's
it.
if
we
went
back
to
trial,
there's
nothing
i
could
possibly
present
that--
mr.
ronald
yank
--well--
mr.
ronald
yank
--but
that
wouldn't
add
anything
with
regard
to
the
merits.
i
believe
we've
got
standing
enough.
i
suppose
we
could
bring
in
another
couple
hundred
correctional
officers,
but
the
point
is,
is
that
on
the
merits
we've
lost
on
title
vii.
what
we
have
here
is...
in
california
and
i'm
sure
elsewhere...
the
law
of
the
case.
and
we
have
already
lost.
an
operational
necessity
defense
has
been
factually
made
out
and
found
to
exist
by
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
ronald
yank
and
it's
sustained.
it's
the
law
of
the
case.
what
more
can
we
do?
it
would
be
utterly
fruitless--
mr.
ronald
yank
--yes;
absolutely.
and,
as
can
any
court,
the
parties
may
not
confer
jurisdiction
upon
a
court
by--
mr.
ronald
yank
--i
don't
believe
under
california
law
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
decision
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
ronald
yank
yes,
the
court
could
have
rejected
that
stipulation
and,
for
example,
asked
us
to
go
through
the
motions
of
amending
the
complaint
naming
the
other
five
persons
who
were
reachable
and
were
willing
to
become
a
plaintiff.
we
could
have
done
that
rather
socially
wasteful,
i
think,
activity.
the
trial
court
sat
there
and
heard
all
the
witnesses
and
had
heard
people
say
they
were
willing
to
be
plaintiff,
and
indeed,
frankly,
the
trial
court
had
admonished
counsel
to
try
and
compact
the
case
because,
as
you
know,
the
evidence
that
we
did
bring
in
was
rather
lengthy
and
voluminous.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
do
have
left.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
yank
okay.
first
of
all,
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
more
than
just
a
plus
factor.
they
talk
about
discrimination,
they
found
that
members
had
been
discriminated.
finding
3
says,
"ccoa
represents
people
who
have
been
discriminated.
"
finding
10,
finding
12...
we're
not
talking
about
two
people
here,
we
are
talking
about
thousands
of
people
being
discriminated
against.
that's
what
the
trial
court--
mr.
ronald
yank
--well,
the
fact
that
it's
literally
put
people
over
the
top.
mr.
ronald
yank
okay.
we
do
not...
we
are
opposed
to
any
kind
of
remand
here.
we
believe
that
one
way
or
another
the
federal
issue
is
squarely
before
the
court
on
these
facts.
counsel
seems
to
be
suggesting,
as
they
have
throughout
at
the
appellate
level,
let
them
make
out
a
case
for
past
discrimination.
that
isn't
this
plan.
that's
never
the
justification.
the
goals
aren't
geared
toward
remedying
past
discrimination.
as
in
washington
v.
davis,
you
have
a
certain
plan
before
you
and
a
certain
set
of
facts.
we
believe
that
on
the
constitutional
merits
we're
entitled
to
win.
if
they
want
to
draft
a
new
plan,
they
can
go
back
and
do
it,
but
we're
entitled
to
win
on
this
suit.
mr.
ronald
yank
yes.
mr.
ronald
yank
when
they
say
that--
mr.
ronald
yank
--yes.
