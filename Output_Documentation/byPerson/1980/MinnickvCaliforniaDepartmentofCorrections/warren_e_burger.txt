chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
minnick
v.
california
department
of
corrections.
mr.
yank,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
under
california
practice,
if
two
parties
come
in
and
stipulate
that
there
is
standing
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff,
may
the
trial
judge
reexamine
that
and
reject
the
stipulation?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
just
talking
about
standing,
now,
not
jurisdiction.
obviously
they
can't
confer
jurisdiction,
but
this
trial
court,
if
the
case
goes
back,
could
decide
that
there
is
no
standing,
could
it
not?
is
it
free
to
do
so?
chief
justice
burger
perhaps
not
an
appropriate
one,
but
it
has
the
power
to
decide
that,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
by
that
that
they
could
assign
women
to
the
women's
ward
or
the
women's
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
have
one
minute,
mr.
yank.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
