mr.
yank,
i'm
bothered
by
something
else.
your
attack
here
is
on
the
1974
affirmative
action
plan,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
let
me
ask
this.
justice
blackmun
can
you
answer
that
question,
really,
first
of
all?
and
my
second
one
is,
is
that
affirmative
action
plan
any
longer
in
effect?
justice
blackmun
well,
is
the
'79
plan,
or
amended
in
'79,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
blackmun
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
blackmun
well,
let
me
ask
one
other
question
then.
does
the
plan
as
amended
in
'75
and
'79
differ
in
any
material
respects
from
the
'74
plan
originally
under
attack?
