justice
white
could
i
ask...
i
ask
you
before
your
time
runs
out
what
your
answer
is
to
the
final
judgment
argument?
justice
white
do
you
think
on
the
merits
of
the
case
that
you
have
put
in
all
the
facts
that
you
can
possibly
put
in,
so
that
the
possibility
of
a
new
trial
is...
what?
fruitless,
or
groundless
or
what?
justice
white
but
is
it
true
that
a
reversal
is
always
for
a
new
trial
under
california
practice?
justice
white
because
this
is
a
purely
legal
question,
do
you
think?
it's
been
decided,
is
that
what
you...
or
is
it
a
factual?
justice
white
regardless
of
any
facts
that
you
have,
though,
there's
a
claimed
justification;
it's
been
sustained?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
the
response
of
your
colleague
to
that
argument
is
that
there's
nothing
that
can
happen
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
if
there
are
further
proceedings,
that
can
overcome
the
judgment
that
there
has
been
a
compelling
state
interest
shown
that
would
override
any
claims
of
discrimination.
justice
white
and
you
have
to
depart
from
him,
don't
you?
if
he's
right,
what
about
finality?
justice
white
but
if
there's
nothing
further
to
be
done
on
that
particular
issue,
there
would
be
finality.
justice
white
when
will
you
get
around
to
answering
my
question,
rather
than
stating
what
you
want
to
state
now?
justice
white
if
you
don't,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear.
your
colleague
says
that
the
court
below
ruled
that
compelling
state
interests
had
been
shown,
and
that
justifies
the
program,
regardless
of
what
is
shown
with
respect
to
discrimination.
that's
what
he
says,
and
that
that
makes...
that
there's
nothing
they
can
do
about
that
in
the
trial
court.
now
is
that
so
or
not?
justice
white
all
right.
you
said
it
isn't
so.
suppose
it
is
so?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
well,
mr.
pollak,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
your
chances
of
losing
this
case
are
very
high
after
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion,
would
you?
justice
white
of
course,
if
i'm
right,
it
just
means
that
you
would
rather
be
here
maybe
next
term
than
this
term?
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeal
raised
grave
doubt
about
the
standing
of
the
organization.
justice
white
and
said
that
that
affects
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court.
justice
white
you
can
stipulate
all
you
want
to
about
standing
but
you
can't
stipulate
jurisdiction.
justice
white
now,
suppose
we
said
there
was
no
standing
in
this
case
for
purposes
of
our
jurisdiction,
and
we
just
dismissed
the
case.
i
suppose
that
what
you're
saying
is,
what
we
would
be
saying
is
that
there's...
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
there
never
has
been
standing
in
this
case
to
decide
the
federal
constitutional
question.
justice
white
within
the
federal
meaning.
