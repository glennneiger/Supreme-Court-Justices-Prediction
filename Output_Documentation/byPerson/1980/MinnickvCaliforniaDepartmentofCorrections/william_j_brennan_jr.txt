justice
jr.
mr.
yank,
may
i
ask
you,
this
case
involves
only
promotion
or
transfer,
does
not
involve
new
hirings,
does
it?
justice
jr.
well,
in
the
cases
of
minnick
and
darden?
justice
jr.
and
it's
only
their
cases
that
we
have?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
as
to
minnick
and
darden,
i
note
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion...
this
is
at
page
a6...
this
statement:
"proof
was
presented
by
respondents
minnick
and
darden
in
support
of
the
inference
that
each
had
been
denied
promotion
in
deference
to
a
female
or
minority
candidate,
and
it
was
shown
that
each
had
pursued
a
grievance
to
the
state
personnel
board
without
success.
"
and
this
next
sentence:
"it
was
also
established,
however,
that
neither
had
been
eligible
for
promotion
under
conventional
civil
service
rules
which
applied
irrespective
of
the
aap.
"
--this
program...
"or
its
implementation".
if
that's
true,
at
least
as
to
minnick
and
darden,
what
standing
have
they
here.
justice
jr.
oh,
it
says
here,
it
says
here...
are
you
quarreling
with
this
statement
by
the
court
of
appeal
that
neither
had
been
eligible
for
promotion?
justice
jr.
i'm
not
asking
that.
justice
jr.
well,
are
we
to
take
this...
this
is
what
your
state
court
said.
are
we
to
go
behind
that?
justice
jr.
they
had
that
standing
even
if
they
had
no...
were,
in
any
event,
not
eligible
for
promotion?
justice
jr.
i
don't
care
what
the
trial
court
found.
the
appellate...
it's
its
decision
we
have
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
--the
difficulty
is
you
didn't
bring
them
in.
you
brought
in
two
people,
apparently,
who
are
not
eligible
for
promotion
in
any
event.
justice
jr.
mr.
pollak,
your
time
is
about
over.
are
you
going
to
address
the
question
of
standing
at
all
or
aren't
you
concerned
about
it?
justice
jr.
well,
you
were
told
by
the
court
of
appeal,
as
i
read
this
last
sentence,
you
couldn't
do
that,
weren't
you?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
what's
your
position?
your
time's
about
over.
justice
jr.
what
is
the
significance,
if
any,
of
the
court
of
appeal's
statement
that
in
any
event
they
would
not
have
qualified,
would
not
have
been
eligible
for
promotion.
that
is,
minnick
and
darden
would
not?
justice
jr.
well,
significant
to
what
extent?
justice
jr.
i
don't
see
that
that
has
a
thing
to
do
with
it.
what
is
it
for
our
purposes?
justice
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
doremus?
justice
jr.
the
fact
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
said
there
was
standing,
this
court
said,
is
immaterial
here
on
standing
in
this
court.
justice
jr.
and
the
only
two
here,
according
to
the
court
of
appeal,
suffered
no
injury
because
they
weren't
eligible
for
promotion.
and
there
are
no
allegation
with
respect
to
any
other
members'
injury.
