justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
yank,
you're
not
suggesting
that
for
federal
case
or
controversy
purposes
in
this
court
that
we
have
jurisdiction
to
accord
standing,
or
we
ordinarily
accord
standing
to
an
association
qua
an
association
simply
because
some
of
its
unnamed
members
may
have
been
injured
by
a
particular
act?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
yank,
supposing
that
the
case
of
naacp
v.
button,
which
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you
about
a
moment
ago,
had
come
up
in
a
state
court
rather
than
federal
court,
as
i
believe
it
did,
and
the
state
court
had
simply
said,
we
don't
accord
standing
to
associations
to
represent
their
members.
do
you
think
we
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
revise
that
judgment,
assuming
there
had
been
no
individual
plaintiffs
who?
justice
rehnquist
actually,
however,
if
it
had
come
up
through
the
courts
of
virginia...
i
have
some
difficulty
remembering
whether
that
was
the
case
for
illegal
practice
of
law
or
not...
then,
if
we
held
it
had
standing,
it
would
be
a
federal
holding.
justice
rehnquist
what
question
of
law
do
you
say
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
it
also
true
that
at
page
a22
and
a23
the
court
of
appeal
upheld
the
trial
court's
ruling
in
refusing
to
allow
reopening
of
the
record
when
the
respondents
here
sought
to
prove
past
practice
of
discrimination,
saying
that
it
was
way
out
of
time,
and
the
trial
court
was
acting
properly
in
refusing
to
hear
that
testimony?
justice
rehnquist
without
regard
to
the
history
of
past
discrimination?
justice
rehnquist
that's
right.
justice
rehnquist
let
me
read
you
this
sentence
from
finding
19
which
justice
stevens
has
referred
to,
and
you've
cited
as
being
at
f6,
where
the
court
says,
"because
of
the
conditions
and
circumstances
within
california
prisons
and
throughout
the
department
of
corrections
in
making
job
assignments
and
in
determining
employment
responsibilities,
it
is
necessary
for
the
department
to
consider
among
other
factors
the
composition
of
existing
work
force
and
of
the
inmate
population,
and
race
and
sex
of
employees
in
order
to
serve
the
compelling
state
interest
in
promoting
the
safety
of
correctional
officers
and
inmates,
encouraging
inmate
rehabilitation,
minimizing
racial
tensions,
and
furthering
orderly
and
efficient
prison
management.
"
now,
certainly
that
much
has
been
decided,
has
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
did
the
court
of
appeal
reverse
the
superior
court?
justice
rehnquist
right.
but
what
about
finding
19?
there
they
say
you
can
consider
it.
justice
rehnquist
and
you
would
distinguish
naacp
v.
button,
assuming
it
came
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
in
that
there
the
virginia
court
said
there
was
standing
for
the
naacp
to
raise
the
question?
because
its
members
suffered
injury?
justice
rehnquist
well,
many
people
would
have
said
that
before
cox,
but
how
can
you
say
it
after
cox?
