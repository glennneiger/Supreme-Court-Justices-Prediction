how
about
naacp
v.
alabama?
it
goes
back
to
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
mr.
yank,
you
haven't
told
us
yet
on
what
provision
of
statutory
or
constitutional
law
you're
relying
to
argue
that
this
is
all
illegal.
justice
stewart
the
case
that
you
opened
with
involved
a
private
employer.
this
involves
a
governmental
employer.
a
private
employer,
so
far
as
the
constitution
goes,
can
hire
all
negroes
or
all
white
people
or
all
males
or
all
females
and
do
whatever
he
wants,
so
far
as
the
constitution
goes.
government,
on
the
other
hand,
is
limited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
stewart
under
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
stewart
no,
this
is
government.
justice
stewart
this
is
governmental
action,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
that
was
not
true
in
weber
and
it
was
not
true
in
the
hughes
case
with
which
you
began
your
argument.
justice
stewart
what
does
weber
have
to
do
with
this
case?
this
is
a
governmental
action.
weber
was
not
at
all.
that
was
a
private
employer
and
a
labor
union.
justice
stewart
why?
why
is
the
ruling
in
weber
applicable?
that
did
not
involve
the
constitution
at
all.
justice
stewart
right.
this
is
a
government.
justice
stewart
so
what
does
weber
have
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
stewart
but
you
claim
they
can't
because
the
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
title
vii
actions.
correct?
justice
stewart
all
right.
but
even
if
so,
you'd
then
run
to
the
protection
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
stewart
all
right.
justice
stewart
and
in
that
respect
the
court
of
appeal
said
the
trial
court
was
wrong,
did
it
not?
because
the
trial
court
in
appendix
d-2,
as
you
pointed
out
to
us,
said
that,
"plaintiffs
assert
that
the
hiring
or
promotion
by
a
governmental
employer
of
a
person
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
sex
or
racial
background
or
ancestry
is
unconstitutional
and
void.
"
and
the
court
of
appeal
in
that
respect
said
the
trial
court
was
wrong,
didn't
it,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
stewart
so
if
this
court
should
agree
with
the
trial
court,
then
there's
no
question
but
what
the
court
of
appeal
should
be
reversed,
is
there?
and
to
that
extent
it's
final
under
cox
v.
louisiana,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
i
mean,
if
the
trial
court
is
right,
there's
nothing
more
to
be
decided?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
right;
by
government.
justice
stewart
entirely
by
government
and
its
employees.
justice
stewart
correct.
right.
justice
stewart
that
was
with
respect
to
the
racial
action,
so-called?
justice
stewart
the
gender
affirmative
action,
so-called,
was
based
upon
the
labor
pool,
was
it
not?
justice
stewart
it
was
statewide?
justice
stewart
well,
the
federal
claim
has
been
decided,
in
this
case,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong
in
its
constitutional
understanding.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stewart
other
issues
if
the
court
of
appeal
is
correct.
only
if
the
court
of
appeal
is
correct.
is
that
right?
