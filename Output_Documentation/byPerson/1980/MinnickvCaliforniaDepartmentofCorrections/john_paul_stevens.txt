justice
stevens
perhaps
you're
right,
mr.
yank,
but
the
court
of
appeal
in
california
left
open
that
question,
didn't
it,
when
it
remanded
the
case?
is
that
correct?
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
it
says
that
you
couldn't
confer
standing
by
stipulation,
and
that
was
a
question
to
be
opened
on
remand,
so
we
really
don't
know
the
facts
yet.
justice
stevens
well,
what
are
we
to
make
of
the
last
sentence?
"these
problems
require
examination
if
the
case
is
to
be
retried?
"
justice
stevens
no,
but
we
have
to
decide
a
lawsuit.
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
class
action
certified
here.
justice
stevens
we
only
have
two
individuals
and
an
association,
and
the
individuals
have
not
been
harmed
according
to
what
mr.
justice
brennan
read,
and
the
association's
standing
is
in
doubt,
based
on
the
last
sentence
of
the
opinion.
justice
stevens
even
if
it's
justiciable
in
a
federal
sense,
would
it
necessarily
be
justiciable
in
the
state
courts?
and
this
is
a
state
proceeding.
justice
stevens
we
have
to
decide
that
though,
don't
we?
the
california
question
of
whether
their
standing
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
stevens
it's
rather
unusual
for
us
to
decide
that
kind
of
state
law
issue.
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
you
don't
rely
on
a
state
court,
you
can
never
get
here,
and
they've
said,
we
don't
know
whether
you
belong
in
a
state
court.
justice
stevens
well,
but,
assuming
you're
right,
we
have
to
decide
that
question
of
california
law
under
your
view
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
yes,
mr.
pollak,
but
isn't
there
another
problem,
and
that
is
that,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeal,
they
said
"we
accept
finding
8
and
finding
19.
"
and
they
said
that
finding
8
does
establish
that
there
was
a...
the
affirmative
action
used
race
as
a
plus
factor,
not
a
fact.
finding
19
says
that
that
is
a
permissible
form
of
discrimination
because
of
the
state's
interest
in
the
management
of
the
correctional
officer
system.
and
they
have
held
as
a
matter
of
law,
as
i
understand
it,
that
finding
19
is
a
complete
defense.
and
you
don't
need
to
put
in
your
remedy
of
past
discrimination
evidence
in
order
to
sustain
the
judgment
if
they're
right
about
that.
or,
do
you
defend
that
position,
that
finding
19
is
a
complete
defense?
justice
stevens
now,
isn't
that
issue
squarely
presented
by
the--
justice
stevens
--you
mean,
the
objective
of
having
a
balance
in
the
correction
officers
more
or
less
corresponding
to
the
balance
in
the
inmate
population.
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
court
of
appeal
has
held
you
won
on
that
issue.
justice
stevens
well,
why
did
they
make
finding
19
then?
why
did
they
enter
finding
19?
justice
stevens
well,
i
read
the
court
of
appeal
as
relying
on
that
finding
as
the
justification
for
a
use
of
a
plus
factor.
maybe
i
misread
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
but
that's
what
i
thought
they
held.
justice
stevens
at
a15;
yes.
"in
its
finding
19
the
trial
court
effectively
determined
that
the
practice--
"
the
bottom
of
a15
and
the
top
of
a16.
the
finding
is
supported
by
the
evidence
and
that
disposed
of
the
case.
let
me
try
it
out
in
this
way.
is
the
trial
court
free
in
the
light
of
the
court
of
appeal's
holding
to
decide
that
race
and
these
other
factors
may
not
be
used
at
all,
may
not
be
used
as
a
plus
factor
or
may
not
enter
into
the
decision?
justice
stevens
i'm
still
somewhat
unclear
on
why
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion,
because
it
seems
to
me
they
read
finding
no.
8
as
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
plaintiff
has
proved
that
race
has
been
used
as
a
plus
factor,
and
not
more.
they
haven't
proved
quotas
and
goals
as
matching
and
all
that.
and
they
say,
if
all
they
prove
is
that
it's
a
plus
factor,
then
finding
19
is
an
adequate
defense.
i
understand
you
can
read
it
narrowly
as
applying
only
to
transfers.
and
they
say,
in
words,
on
a70,
"we
conclude
that
they
are
permitted
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
"
in
other
words,
they're
saying,
as
i
read
it,
on
this
record
that
which
the
plaintiff
proved
has
been
adequately
defended
and
the
plaintiff
stands
here
in
court
today
and
tells
us
he
doesn't
want
to
prove
any
more.
on
that
reason,
why
do
we
have
to
another
trial?
i
mean,
don't
we
just
have
to
decide
whether
that
finding
19
is
a
sufficient
defense?
and
i
know
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
be
a
little
concerned
about
that,
but
maybe
you
want
to
try
and
defend
that.
justice
stevens
and
you
might
win,
100
percent,
just
on
that
very
simple
theory.
justice
stevens
there's
no
finding
that
it
did,
is
there?
there's
no
finding
that
it
did.
he
doesn't
want
to
improve
on
the
affirmative
findings,
as
i
understand
it.
why
do
we
have
to
wrestle
with
that
question?
justice
stevens
theoretically,
it
will
remand
and
he
might
amend
his
complaint
and
seek
to
prove
that.
but
he
says
he
doesn't
want
to
prove
anything
more
than
he's
already--
justice
stevens
--but
they
have
also
said
they're
perfectly
content
with
the
record
they
have
made
and
all
they...
they
did
not
persuade
the
trial
court
to
enter
any
such
finding.
justice
stevens
you're
trying
to
defend
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
make
a
better
case
which
is
a
funny
thing
for
the
defendant
to
be
doing.
justice
stevens
well,
for
all
those
reasons,
if
i
were
plaintiff's,
counsel,
i
might
want
to
argue
the
right
to
put
in
more
evidence
to
sustain
that
theory.
but
he
stood
here
before
us
a
few
minutes
ago
and
said
he
doesn't
want
to
put
any
more
evidence
in.
he's
proved
his
case.
then
he
should
also
be
stuck
with
the
findings
he
got
out
of
the
trial
court,
it
seems
to
me.
and
he
didn't
get
such
a
finding.
justice
stevens
he
got...
he
had
won
on
the
theory
that
it
was
per
se
illegal.
and
he
got
some
additional
findings
that
show
that
race
was
a
plus
factor
and
he
also
was
confronted
with
some
findings
that
say,
well,
if
that's
all
you've
got,
there's
a
reason
for
the
plus
factor,
namely,
there's
a
state
interest
in
having
the
inmate
population
correspond
to
some
extent
with
the
correctional
officer
population.
i
don't
know
why
that
isn't
the
issue
right
here,
whether
that's
an
adequate
justification.
justice
stevens
any
time
a
plus
factor
is
involved,
there's
discrimination.
that's
all
those
findings
are
saying.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
always
going
to
happen
when
you
use
it
as
a
plus
factor.
justice
stevens
mr.
yank,
you're
entitled
to
win
on
the
evidence
you
offered,
and
you
also
contend
you're
entitled
to
win
on
the
findings
that
the
trial
court
made,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
okay.
you're
satisfied
with
the
findings.
justice
stevens
well,
just
yes
or
no.
