mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
tried
in
the
superior
court
in
san
francisco
before
this
court
had
rendered
its
decision
in
bakke;
indeed,
before
this
court
had
rendered
its
decision
in
the
united
jewish
organization
v.
carey
case.
the
sole
issue
on
which
the
parties
focused
when
this
case
was
tried
in
superior
court
was
a
question
open
at
the
time
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
permissible
for
the
department
of
corrections
under
any
circumstances
to
give
any
consideration
to
the
question
of
race
or
sex
in
hiring
and
promotional
practice.
the
petitioners
before
the
superior
court
argued
that
it
was
not,
that
absolutely
no
consideration
could
be
given
under
any
circumstances,
that
race
and
sex
were
absolutely
impermissible
considerations,
and
the
superior
court
accepted
that
view.
that
it
did
so
is
clear
from
the
record
but
it
is
made
very
simply
clear
by
looking
at
the
notice
of
intended
decision
of
the
superior
court,
which
is
in
appendix
d
to
the
petition,
the
court
framed
the
issues.
the
department
at
that
time
defended
its
policy
on
the
ground
that
race
and
sex
were
not
the
only
factors,
and
then
quoting,
said,
"plaintiffs
on
the
other
hand
assert
that
the
hiring
or
promotion
of
a
person
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
sex
or
racial
background
or
ancestry
is
unconstitutional
and
void.
"
"the
court
agrees
with
plaintiffs.
"
and
the
court
went
on,
then,
to
enter
an
injunction,
which
is
appendix
g
to
the
petition,
which
prohibited
the
department
from
giving
any
preference,
advantage,
or
benefit
based
on
race,
color,
sex,
or
national
origin
in
hiring
or
promotion.
and
it
is
that
judgment
in
that
injunction
which
the
petitioners
are
asking
this
court
to
reinstate.
that
is
their
request,
if
you
look
at
the
conclusion
of
both
the
briefs
they
filed
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeal
in
california,
of
course,
reversed
that
decision.
it
held
that
race
or
sex
may
be
considered
if
necessary
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest
which
the
court
of
appeal
held
the
orderly
administration
of
prisons
to
be.
the
court
of
appeal's
reversal
of
that
decision
had
the
effect
of
remanding
the
case
to
the
superior
court
for
a
new
trial
necessarily,
i
believe,
raising
the
question
asked
by
justice
white
a
few
moments
ago,
whether
or
not
we
even
have
a
final
decision
here
in
this
case.
and
i
submit
that
most
clearly
the
court
does
not
have
a
final
decision
here
and
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
go
on
and
to
consider
this
case.
while
the
court
of
appeal
quite
properly,
i
submit,
applied
this
court's
decisions
in
bakke
and
weber
and
now
fullilove
to
reverse
a
superior
court
decision--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is...
i
think
it's
probably
an
issue
not
to
be
reached,
but
there
is
potentially
a
question
of
whether
title
vii
would
prohibit
the
plan
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
department,
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
ruling
in
weber
is
applicable
and
the
plan--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--well,
your
honor,
i
submit
we
have
an
additional
question
in
this
case
not
present
in
weber
and
that
is
whether
the
plan
is
permissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
that
issue
is
here,
your
honor.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
is
not,
so--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--i
think
weber
has
to
do
with
the
case
only
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioners
are
also
relying
upon
title
vii
for
their
claim--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--we
assert
that,
and
then
we
assert
that
if
in
fact
we
are
incorrect
in
that
respect,
that
the
program
is
permissible
under
title
vii.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
we
then
come
to
the
equal
protection
clause;
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
we're
not
suggesting
that
we
don't
have
that
ultimately
here,
if
the
case
is
a
final
judgment
and
properly
before
the
court.
and
the
point
that
i'd
like
to
stress
at
the
outset
is
that
although
the
court
of
appeal
properly
held
that
the
superior
court
was
wrong
in
saying
you
can
never
consider
race
or
sex,
the
decision
is
not
a
final
decision,
a
final
judgment
within
the
meaning
of
section
1257,
because
there
remain
on
remand
many
issues
to
be
considered
which
go
to
the
heart
of
the
petitioners'
federal
claims
which
he
has
asserted,
which
they
were
asserting
in
this
court.
and
until
those
questions
to
which
i'll
come
in
a
moment...
until
those
questions
are
resolved,
neither
this
court
nor
anyone
else
will
know
whether
the
state
courts
will
or
will
not
grant
petitioners
the
relief
they
seek
on
their
federal
grounds.
and
i
think
that
is
the
important
point
which
i'd
like
to
stress
insofar
as
the
law
is
concerned.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
this
court
in
recent
years
has
expanded
somewhat
on
earlier
definitions
of
what
constitutes
a
final
judgment.
there
are,
for
example,
decisions
of
this
court
indicating
that
a
decision
may
be
final
where
a
federal
issue
has
been
conclusively
resolved
in
the
state
court,
but
further
proceedings
remain
to
be
had
on
other
issues.
but
no
case...
and
i
stress
that
neither
our
research
nor
the
research
of
the
several
amicus
briefs
which
address
this
point,
nor
indeed
petitioners
themselves,
found
any
case
where
you
have
a
final
decision
in
a
situation
where
further
state
court
proceedings
remained
on
the
very
federal
issues
that
are
involved,
and
which
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
have
reviewed
in
this
court.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
justice
white,
that
is
where
i
part
from
my
colleague.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
well,
if
in
fact
there
was
nothing
further
that
could
be
done,
then
you
would
have
a
final--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--if
i
may,
let
me
attempt
to
define
the
issues
which
i
think
are
resolved
and
those
which
remain
to
be
considered.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
well,
your
honor,
i
believe,
if
i
understand
your
question--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--it
is
not
so,
your
honor.
i
believe...
two
things--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--if
it
were
so,
you'd
have
a
final
judgment.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
but
it
is
not
so,
and
let
me
address
myself
to
why
that
is
the
case.
i
believe
the
effect
of
the
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeal
is
to
remand
the
case
to
the
superior
court
for
a
new
trial
on
all
issues.
the
only
thing
that
is
determined
by
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal
is
a
strict
question
of
law,
leaving
open
for
consideration
questions
of
fact
and
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
the
question
of
law,
justice
rehnquist,
that
i
say
was
resolved,
is
that
the
correctional
objectives
of
the
department
of
corrections
constitute
a
compelling
state
interest
in
that
a
compelling
state
interest
can
justify
constitutionally
and
under
title
vii
employment
practices
which
are
race-conscious,
if
they
are
properly
limited
to
accomplish
that
objective.
what
has
not
been
decided,
and
what
remains
to
be
further
explored
on
remand,
is
(a)
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
program
the
department
is
carrying
out
and
implementing,
and
secondly
the
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
department's
program
is
sufficiently
limited
to
accomplish
only
the
compelling
state
interest
which
they
are
designed
to
serve,
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeal
decided
that
question
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it,
but
i
also
believe
that
by
remand
the
court
of
appeal
has
furnished
the
parties
with
the
opportunity
to
submit
additional
evidence
to
expand
upon
those
issues.
the
court
of
appeal
has
not
determined...
if
i
could
bring
this
into
the
concrete
with
respect
to
specific
challenges
to
the
department's
program
that
the
petitioners
are
making--
the
focal
point
of
the
petitioners'
attack
on
our
claim
is
their
contention
that
the
department
is
setting
aside
positions
for
minority
members
excluding
nonminorities
from
any
consideration
for
promotion.
now,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it,
the
court
of
appeal
has
held
that
the
department
is
not
doing
that,
that
all
the
department
is
doing
in
connection
with
promotions
is
taking
race
into
account
as
one
consideration
which
under
appropriate
circumstances
can
act
as
a
plus
factor
in
an
individual's
favor.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
it
did,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that
legal
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
could
be
considered.
i
think
the
court,
the
superior--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--no,
your
honor,
i
submit
it
is
not.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
if
the
trial
court
is
right
with
respect
to
the
narrow
issue--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--are
there
any
circumstances
under
which
race
could
be
considered?
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
then
it
may
be
that
there
was
a
decision
for
the--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--that's
right.
brought
by
a
governmental
agency.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
if
there
are
any
circumstances--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--your
honor,
i
suppose
it
is
correct
that
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
the
superior
court
would
have
been
justified
if
it
had
excluded
that
evidence
on
that
ground,
which
it
did
not
do.
that
wasn't
the
superior
court's
reason.
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeal
did
explicitly
say
that
all
of
that
evidence
with
respect
to
prior
discrimination
can
be
considered
when
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
superior
court.
so
that
even
if
the
superior
court
was
correct
initially
in
excluding
the
evidence
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
this
case
goes
back
to
the
superior
court
that
evidence
will
be
admissible
and
will
be
considered.
and
i
think
that
is
the
important
point
with
respect
to
this
limited
aspect
of
the
finality
question.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
we
assert,
your
honor,
that...
we...
the
court
of
appeal
has
held
that
as
long
as
race
is
only
taken
into
account
as
a
plus
factor,
that
it
may
be
taken
into
account
in
connection
with
hiring
and
promotion.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
yes.
without
reserve.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
future--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--i
submit,
your
honor,
it
is
not
squarely
presented
for
this
reason,
that
on
remand
one
of
the
questions
that
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
or
not
the
department's
program
is
sufficiently
tailored
to
meet
that
objective.
that's
the
second
half
of
the
constitutional
test.
and
on
remand--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
plan
and
the
goals,
is
it
permissible
to
have
a
goal
which
seeks
to
attain
a
parity
with
the
inmate
population
rather
than
the
labor
force?
i
submit--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--yes,
your
honor,
it
was
with
respect
to
race.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
yes.
on
this
question
of
race
and
the
permissibility
of
the
goals
with
respect
to
race,
that
question
has
never
been
considered
at
any
stage
in
either
the
superior
court
or
the
court
of
appeal.
at
no
point
in
the
proceedings...
you
could
comb
the
record--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--the
court
did
not
address
itself
in
finding
19,
your
honor,
to
the
question
of
whether
the
goals
of
the
program
are
sufficiently
limited
or
whether
they
go
too
far.
that
was
not
a
question
that
was
briefed
or
addressed
in
the
superior
court.
finding
19
is
not
addressed
to
that
question,
and
it
was
not
considered
in
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
your
honor,
the
finding
19...
it's
on
page
f6
of
the--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--no,
your
honor,
only
with
respect
to
that
limited
question
has
there
been
a
determination
that
is
conclusive
by
the
court
of
appeal.
the
question
that
remains
for
further
consideration
under
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
is
whether
or
not
the
department's
plan
is
sufficiently
tailored
to
accomplish
that
objective
in
a
permissible
manner.
and
on
remand,
it
will
be
free
to
the
petitioners
to
offer
evidence
and
to
squarely
address
this
issue
which,
i
repeat,
has
never
been
addressed
in
the
state
courts,
of
whether
or
not
the
goals
go
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
achieve
the
state
interest
in
orderly
prison
administration.
and
at
the
same
time
the
department
will
have
the
opportunity
to
offer
evidence
addressed
to
that
very
question.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
your
honor,
i
submit...
perhaps
i'm
not
making
myself
clear...
i
acknowledge--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
point,
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
case.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
yes,
your
honor,
that
it
is
permissible
to
consider
these
factors.
what
has
not
been
decided
and
what
will
be
the
subject
of
evidence
and
litigation
on
remand
is
whether
or
not
the
department
is
giving
too
much
consideration,
consideration
which
exceeds
what
would
be
permissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
i
confess,
your
honor,
that
it's
not...
why
they
reversed
it
was
because
the
superior
court
had
reached
a
decision
which
had
said
you
can't
consider
race
or
sex
at
all.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
no,
they
said
it
could
be
considered
in
making
job
assignments.
and
what
the
court
was,
what
the
superior
court
was
doing
was
distinguishing
job
assignments
from
promotions,
and
hiring.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
that's
correct,
your
honor.
or
that
from
a
group
of
sergeants,
for
example,
a
particular
sergeant
could
be
given
a
particular
work
assignment
because
of
his
race.
that
is
what
the
superior
court,
i
believe,
was
sanctioning.
but
what
the
superior
court
was
saying
is
that
in
determining
whether
to
promote
this
particular
individual
from
sergeant
to
lieutenant,
you
couldn't
give
any
consideration
whatsoever
to
that
person's
race
or
sex.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
the
reason
is--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--your
honor,
the
point
is
this,
at
has
surfaced
as
this
case,
both
as
a
law
has
developed
and
as
this
case
has
risen,
is
that,
all
of
a
sudden
in
this
court,
really
for
the
first
time,
the
question
is
in
focus,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not...
not
the
first
question
of
permissibility
of
the
goal,
but
focus
on
the
second
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
department's
program
goes
further
than
necessary
to
accomplish
that
goal.
and
that
isn't--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--because,
your
honor,
when--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--but,
your
honor,
the
petitioners
do
wish
to
argue,
and
are
arguing
to
this
court,
that
the
department's
program
does
go
further
than
is
necessary
to
accomplish
this
objective.
they
do
argue
that
the
program
is
excessive
because
the
goals
are
more
excessive
than
necessary.
that
is
an
issue
(a)
which
has
never
been
considered
in
the
state
courts,
and
(b)
which
will
be
open
to
the
presentation
of
evidence
when
this
case
is
remanded.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
your
honor,
if
the
petitioners
were--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--i
am
trying
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
arguing
to
this
court,
and
inducing
this
court
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
the
program
is
excessive
in
a
respect
as
to
which
no
evidence
has
been
introduced.
if
the
petitioners
were
willing
to
withdraw
from
this
court's
consideration
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
program
is
sufficiently
tailored
to
accomplish
its
objectives,
that
would
be
fine.
and
that
issue,
i
submit
is
inextricably
part
of
the
federal
constitutional
question
which
this
court
has
to
consider.
and
the
petitioners
are
urging
this
court
that
the
program
is
excessive
in
a
particular
which
has
never
been
considered
in
the
state
courts
and
as
to
which
none
of
the
parties,
including
the
department,
had
any
opportunity
to
present
evidence.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
he
did
not
get
any
finding
that
the--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--because...
i
believe
what
is
included
in
the
issue
that
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
have
this
court
decide
is
whether
in
order
to
achieve
the
compelling
state
interest
of
furthering
orderly
prison
administration,
it
is
necessary
to
go
so
far
as
to
have
goals
which
seek
to
achieve
an
approximate
parity
with
the
inmate
population.
and
that
is
something
that
we
have
not
considered
below,
and
as
to
which
we
have
never
offered
any
evidence.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
your
honor,
we
are...
with
respect
to
standing,
we
of
course
stipulated
in
the
superior
court
that
standing
existed
and
i
am
somewhat--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--well,
we
were
told
that
our
stipulation
does
not...
was
not
sufficient,
and
correctly
so,
to
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
superior
court.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
is
briefed
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--our
position,
your
honor,
is,
first
of
all,
that
the
existence
of
this
standing
question,
which
will
definitely
have
to
be
explored
on
remand,
goes
very
much
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
we
do
not
know
whether
we
have
a
final--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--i
believe
that
is
a
very
significant
event
in
determining--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--my
reservation,
your
honor,
is
the
fact
that
we
have
stipulated,
due
to
the
fact--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--for
federal
purposes--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
absence
of
plaintiffs
who
have
been
injured
and
the
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
we
did
not
stipulate
that
the
plaintiffs
had
been
injured.
we
stipulated
to
standing,
but
we
did
not
stipulate
that
they
had
been
injured.
and
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
injured,
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
denied
a
promotion
may
well
under
doremus
indicate
that
we
have
no
more
than
an
academic
question--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
absolutely.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--there
has
never
been
standing
within
the
federal--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
on
remand,
it
will
remain
to
be
determined,
that
i
don't
think
this
court
could
possibly
determine,
whether
or
not
there
ever
was
standing
within
state
court
standards.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
absolutely;
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
all
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
our
stipulation
certainly
was
never
that
such
facts
exist.
we
simply
stipulated
to
standing,
period.
i
submit,
your
honor,
in
closing,
that
the
issues
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
those
that
have
been
decided
and
those
that
remain
to
be
decided,
are
inextricably
interwoven.
you
can't
pick
just
one
issue
and
review
it.
you
have
claims
here
that
are
asserted
by
the
petitioners,
federal
claims,
as
to
which
additional
evidence
will
be
appropriate
in
the
state
courts.
and
given
that
fact,
you
do
not
have
a
conclusive
determination
as
to
whether
the
state
courts
will
or
will
not
give
petitioners
relief
on
their
federal
claims.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
because
cox,
your
honor,
the
federal
claim
had
been
decided,
and
there
were
other
issues
that
remained
to
be
determined.
here
it's
the
very
federal
claims,
the
constitutional
claims
and
also
the
title
vii
claims,
that
will
be
open
for
the
presentation
of
additional
evidence
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
yes,
your
honor.
to
that
extent.
but
there
are
other
issues
that
are
part
of
that--
mr.
stuart
r.
pollak
--that
is
correct.
