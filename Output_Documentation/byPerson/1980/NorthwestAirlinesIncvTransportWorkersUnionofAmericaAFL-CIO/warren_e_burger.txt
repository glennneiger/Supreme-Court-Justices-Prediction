we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
northwest
airlines
v.
transport
workers.
mr.
lacovara,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
when
you
say
"wrongdoer",
a
wrong
arising
from
what?
from
violation
of
a
statute
or
from
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
violation
stems
from
the
contract
between
the
union
and
northwest
airlines,
is
it
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
difference,
is
there
not?
here
your
starting
point
is
that
you
have
a
contract
entered
into,
presumably,
at
arm's
length;
we
must
assume
that
whether
it's
true
or
not.
the
arm's
length
contract
entered
into
and
now
you
propose
that
the
courts
should
be
open
to
go
back
and
go
through
this
really
very
difficult
process
of
who
was
responsible,
which
of
the
two
contracting
parties
was
the
more
responsible
or...
assumed
division
of
responsibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
there
something
about
the
old
maxim
of
in
pari
delicto
that
gets
into
the
act
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
i
said,
something
like
the
in
pari
delicto
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
mr.
lacovara,
there's
something
here
more
than
just
crowded
dockets
of
courts.
it's
what
brings
certain
types
of
cases
to
the
courts
that
could
have
been
avoided,
that
is,
could
have
been
avoided
if
two
parties
hadn't
been
engaged
in
some
kind
of
mutual
and
reciprocal
wrongdoing.
and
the
courts
are
not
quite
as
hospitable,
shouldn't
be
as
hospitable
to
trying
to
remedy
the
relative
justice
as
between
those
two
as
they
would
with
other
types
of
claims.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
think
unions
will
stop
high-pressuring
lawyers
to
do
these
things,
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
there's
another
way
to
eliminate
that
discrimination,
and
that's
for
the
employer
to
say,
no,
to
the
union,
when
the
union
presses
them
to
discriminate,
or
vice
versa.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
moldof.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
burger
then
the
result,
mr.
wallace,
depends
on
the
fortuity
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
bring
some
suit
against
both
the
union
and
the
employer,
or
whether
the
employer
doesn't
ever
get
around
to
bringing
the
union
into
the
case.
chief
justice
burger
we
don't
know
that,
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
is
no
traditional
decision
holding
that
the
union
could
not
have
been
joined
with
the
employer
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacovara,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
northwest
airlines
against
transport
workers
union
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens
and
he
will
also
announce
the
disposition
of
city
of
memphis
against
green.
