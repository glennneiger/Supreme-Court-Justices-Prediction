mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
this
action
northwest
is
asking
for
contribution
for
its
liability
in
laffey
v.
northwest
airlines,
a
liability
that
arose
not
under
the
common
law
but
under
two
specific
federal
statutes,
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act.
neither
of
those
statutes
provide
a
right
of
contribution,
and
the
issue
is
whether
despite
the
absence
of
a
provision
for
contribution
in
those
statutes
this
court
can
nevertheless
recognize
northwest's
claim.
i
think
that's
the
point
where
we
part
company
with
northwest.
northwest
is
telling
this
court
that
all
it
is
asking
for
is
a
remedy.
contribution
is
s
simply
a
remedy,
and
this
court
has
broad
remedial
powers
to
remedy
violations
of
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act.
i
think
this
goes
back
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
of
mr.
lacovara,
what
is
the
recognized
legal
right
which
northwest
possesses,
which
it
claims
has
been
violated,
and
for
which
it
is
asking
this
court
to
impose
a
remedy?
to
use
the
terminology
employed
this
last
year
by
the
court
is
davis
v.
passman,
does
northwest
have
a
cause
of
action?
is
it
among
the
class
of
litigants
who
is
empowered
to
establish
liabilities
for
violations
of
these
statutes?
the
answers
to
these
questions
do
not
turn
simply
on
the
label
that
northwest
has
chosen
to
apply
to
its
claim.
it
calls
this
a
common
law
claim.
but
as
mr.
lacovara
has
acknowledged
this
afternoon,
it
is
a
claim
which
has
as
its
principal
component
the
establishment
of
the
union's
liabilities
under
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act.
that
liability
has
never
been
determined.
i
have
heard
again
this
afternoon
as
i've
heard
in
the
briefs,
that
the
unions
are
clearly
equally
liable
with
northwest
for
the
violations
here.
no
court
has
ever
concluded
that
either
of
these
unions
violated
either
of
these
statutes.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
unions
can
be
sued
under
title
vii.
there
is
also
no
question
that
unions
can
be
liable
for
back
pay
under
title
vii.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
without
getting
into
the
facts--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--it
is
possible,
your
honor;
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
plaintiff
has
a
choice
of
defendants
here.
and
title
vii
provides
the
plaintiff
with
a
choice
of
defendant.
and
i
think
the
critical
focus
should
be
on
the
statute.
as
i
said
before,
unions
can
be
liable
for
violations
of
title
vii.
but
congress
didn't
simply
stop
there.
congress
provided
in
this
statute
in
title
vii
precisely
how
a
party's
liability
is
to
be
established,
and
at
whose
instance.
it
didn't
have
to
do
that,
but
it
did
do
that.
and
it
provided
that
a
title
vii
lawsuit
can
be
brought
by
aggrieved
employees
or
by
the
eeoc.
and
it
provided
precisely
what
rules
would
have
to
be
followed
to
establish
another
party's
liability.
now,
an
absolute
critical
feature
of
that
statute
is
that
a
party
cannot
be
hauled
into
court,
into
federal
court,
with
the
claim
that
it
has
violated
title
vii
unless
the
claim
against
that
party
has
first
been
submitted
to
a
nonjudicial
administrative
process.
that
procedure
is
invoked
by
filing
a
charge
before
the
eeoc.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
we
don't
know;
under
our
reading
of
the
statute
northwest
is
not
among
the
class
of
litigants
who
is
entitled
to
establish
another
party's
title
vii
violations.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
they
certainly
could
have
asked
the
eeoc
to
bring
the
unions
in.
if
northwest
has
any
rights
over
against
the
unions
for
violations
of
title
vii,
then
presumably
they
might
have
the
power
to
file
a
charge.
if
they
are
a
party
that
can
establish
the
union's
liability,
then
there
is
no
justification
within
the
statute
why
they
should
be
allowed
to
establish
that
liability
by
wholly
extra-statutory
means.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
if
they
have
a
right
to
file
a
charge,
your
honor,
it
would
work
just
like
any
other
plaintiff
filing
a
charge.
they
would
file
the
charge
at
some
point
in
time
and
they
either
could
request
the
right
to
sue
letter
or
one
would
be
given
to
them,
if
the
eeoc
determines--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--we
would
take
the
position
they
could
not.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
would
be
a
question.
our
reading
of
the
statute
would
be
that
that
is
a
right
which
goes
over
to
the
aggrieved
employees.
it's
not
a
right
of
the
employer.
but
if
that
were
a
right
that
resides
in
the
employer,
then
that
right
would
have
to
be
processed
just
like
any
other
claim
of
an
unfair,
unlawful
employment
practice.
the
charge
would
have
to
be
flied,
the
matter
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
eeoc,
the
party
would
get
a
right
to
sue
letter.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
no,
this
is
all
predicated...
unless
i
misunderstand
the
hypothetical...
this
is
all
predicated
on
the
fact
that
a
violation
of
(c)(3)
can
somehow
be
asserted
by
the
employer.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
okay.
assuming
he
can,
then
i
would
assume
the
employer
would
be
claiming
that
the
union
has
caused
it
to
violate
the
statute
and
accordingly
has
violated
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
if
this
is
all
predicated--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--well,
this
is
all
predicated
under
the
assumption
that
the
right
provided
in
(c)(3)
resides
in
the
employer.
i
don't
think
the
statute
supports
this.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
difference
here,
your
honor,
is
that
northwest
is
seeking
contribution...
this
is
not
a
regular
tort
case.
northwest
is
seeking--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--it
is
a
contribution
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
right,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
substance
of
that
contribution
claim
is.
the
critical
aspect
of
that
claim,
what
is
essential
for
the
establishment
of
that
claim,
is
the
establishment
of
the
union's
liability
for
violating
title
vii.
that
has
never
been
determined
before.
and
congress
has
set
forth
an
express
procedure
by
which
that
is
to
be
established.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
it's
a
defense...
oh,
i'm
sorry;
of
course,
it's
a
defense
on
the
merits,
but
it's
not
a
question
that
has
to
turn
on
the
merits
of
the
particular
controversy.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there's
nothing
about
the
'66
negotiations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
findings
in
laffey...
that's
the
underlying
case...
which,
by
the
way...
mr.
lacovara
neglected
to
mention
that
this
court
denied
certiorari
to
the
underlying
laffey
decision.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
findings
in
laffey
point
out
that
in
1966
what
northwest
proposed
was
for
the
unions
to
equalize
downing,
to
lower
the
wages,
of
the
pursers
down
to
the
level
of
the
female
employees.
and
that's
precisely
what
is
now
permitted
by
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
there
is
a
remedy.
a
remedy...
if
the
employer
has
remedies.
so
that...
is
that
the
thrust
of
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
remedies...
if
you're
asking
whether
the
aggrieved
employee
who
chooses
one
has
a
remedy--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--right.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
okay.
the
procedure
that
congress
placed
into
title
vii
was
to
allow
charges
and
lawsuits
to
be
filed
by
the
eeoc.
and
the
legislative
history
reflects
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
that
was
put
into
the
statute
was
to
overcome
just
this
type
of
situation
where
a
union
member
might
be
reluctant
to
come
after
his
union,
and
there
would
be
another
procedure
whereby
some
outside
party
could
come
after
the
union.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
far
more
likely
that
an
individual--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--the
remedy
that
i'm
suggesting,
the
procedure
that
i'm
suggesting
is
provided
by
title
vii,
that
the
eeoc
can
file
a
charge.
there
is
no
specific
remedy
in
title
vii
resting
in
the
employer.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
he
may
be
stuck--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--he
may
be
stuck
under--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--your
honor,
when
an
employee
sues
for
violations
of
title
vii,
he's
not
solely
bringing
a
private
lawsuit,
there
are
public
interests
involved
here.
and
we
want
to
encourage
these
people
to
file
lawsuits.
at
least
that's
what
congress
said
it
wanted
to
do.
now,
certainly
if
an
employee
is
forced
to
bring
in
a
union,
the
practical
effect
is
that
the
employee
winds
up
funding
part
of
his
own
back
pay
liability.
the
back
pay
that
the
union
has
to
pay
comes
out
of
union
dues
which
the
aggrieved
employee
himself
funds.
and
that's
something
that
the
employee
can
do
if
he
chooses
to.
but
to
allow
a
discriminating
employer
to
override
the
plaintiff's
choice
not
to
sue
the
union
and
to
force
him
to
accept
that
consequence
seems
to
have
no
basis.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
that
might
not
be
true
for
that
situation,
but
what
generally
happens
in
these
type
of
cases...
for
example,
this
is
an
example
of
the
type
of
situation
i
have
in
mind:
many
of
these
title
vii
cases
are
class
actions
and
the
plaintiff
may
be
suing
not
only
on
its
own
behalf
but
on
behalf
of
a
large
class
many
of
whom
may
be
union
workers;
union
members.
so
the
practical
result
of
that
type
of
a
situation
is
that
the
union
members
who
are
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
are
going
to
wind
up
paying
for
their
own
back
pay.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
yes,
that's
quite--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--assuming
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
invoke
the
mechanisms
under
title
vii.
what
i'm
suggesting,
justice
white--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--well,
i
have
grave
doubts
that
he
is.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
a--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--what
i
would
say,
under
that
circumstance,
what
bars
this
suit
is
the
fact
that
nobody
has
been
able
to
establish
the
union's
liability
under
title
vii
by
the
explicit
procedures
that
congress
placed
in
the
statute
for
establishing
such
liabilities.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that's
one
half
of
the
equation.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
other
half
is,
how
a
party's
liability
is
to
be
established,
first
by
filing
a
charge,
first
by
submitting
a
claim
through
administrative
process.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
whoever,
can
do
it,
a
party
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
potential
for
liability
for
violating
this
statute
by
means
outside
of
the
scheme
that
congress
decided
to
put
into
this
statute.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
then,
if
that
is
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--right.
and
if
he
can't
do
that,
then
his
inability
to
proceed
against
the
union
is
a
consequence
of
the
scheme
that
congress
saw
fit
to
adopt.
if
the
scheme
is
unfair,
if
a
different
scheme
could
have
been
devised...
and
certainly
a
different
scheme
could
have
been
devised.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
employee
certainly
has
the
right
to
go
after
whichever
party
it
wants
to,
or
both
of
them,
if
that's
its
desire.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
in
your
scenario,
if
i
understand
it,
in
the
hypothetical,
both
parties
have
been
charged,
both
parties
have
been
sued,
both
parties
have
been
found
liable.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
the
federal
courts
have
the
authority
at
that
point...
in
fact,
congress
provided
a
procedure
for
the
federal
courts
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
charging
requirement.
the
court's
power
to
fashion
remedies
which
is
created
by
706(g)
of
the
statute
provides
that
once
a
court
finds
that
a
respondent
has
intentionally
violated
the
statute,
the
court
can
order
appropriate
remedies.
and
the
example
you've
provided,
justice
white,
is
one
of
the
types
of
remedies
that
can
be
provided.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that
would
be
an
appropriate
order
because
the
scheme
had
been
consistently
followed.
and
if
either
of
the
defendants
felt
that
that
order
was
inappropriate
because
it
was
not
responsible
to
the
same
extent
as
the
other
party,
the
aggrieved
party,
whether
it's
the
employer
or
union,
could
appeal.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that's
correct.
but
i'm--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--that's
right.
and
through
the
procedures
explicitly
provided
by
congress.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
section
706(g)
provides
that
the
court
can
fashion
remedies.
it
specifies
certain
types
of
remedies,
the
possibility
for
injunctions,
back
pay,
attorneys'
fees.
once
it
is
found
that
a
respondent...
which
is,
by
the
way,
is
defined
as
a
party
that's
been
named
in
a
charge...
has
intentionally
violated
the
statute,
at
that
point
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
the
court
can
allocate.
and
on
the
basis
of
congressional
intent,
which
would
be
the
court's
role
at
that
point,
the
court
could
construe
title
vii
as
empowering--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--yes.
without
statutory
authorization...
the
courts'
powers
in
the
remedial
area
of
title
vii
are
expressly
provided
by
statute.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
you
certainly
have
to
have
the
statutory...
know
the
statutory
rulings.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
if
you're
talking
about
whether
or
why
a
contribution
can
be
recognized
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
you're
talking
about
a
totally...
first
of
all,
there
has
never
been
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
there
is
a
right
of
contribution
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
if
the
controversy
is
between
solely
private--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--if
the
litigation
is
solely
between
private
litigants
and
there's
no
overriding
impact
on
some
kind
of
federal
interest,
then
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
court
would
not
have
the
authority
at
that
point
to
fashion
a
federal
common
law
of
contribution,
and
it
would
have
to
await
litigation.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
and
the
sole
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
is
diversity?
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
if
we're
talking
about
an
erie
type
of
situation,
okay,
the
rule
to
be
fashioned
would
be
a--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--the
reason,
your
honor,
why
we
feel
it
is--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--the
reason
why
we
feel
it
is,
your
honor,
is
because
we're
talking
about
contribution
for
liabilities
under
those
two
statutes
and
under
nothing
else.
that's
not
to
suggest
that
within
the
statutes
the
court
doesn't
have
certain
powers,
but
the
powers
that
the
court
has
within
the
statutes
are
to
be
discerned
through
congressional
intent,
and
it's
the
guidelines
announced
in
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--the
way
this
court
has
construed
those
kind
of
situations
in
the
past
is
that
it
has
applied
maritime
law,
admiralty
law,
where
the
court's
legislative
powers
of
common
law--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
didn't
catch
the
question.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
if
you're
asking
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
i
suppose--
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
--yes,
it
very
definitely
does
turn
on
the
kind
of
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
well,
certainly
it
would
be
an
open
question
whether
you
had
a
federal
remedy
or
whether
you
had
a
state
remedy.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
entertain
this
controversy,
the
only
basis
of
a
federal
interest
in
this
particular
controversy
is
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
rights
and
obligations
under
these
two
statutes.
and
the
right
to
contribution
either
exists
within
these
statutes
or
it
doesn't
exist.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
that
certainly
is
their
practical
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
but
our
interest
is
the
fact
that
we've
never
been
adjudicated
liable
for
violation
of
these
statutes,
and
that's
what
has
to
be
determined
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
moldof
thank
you.
