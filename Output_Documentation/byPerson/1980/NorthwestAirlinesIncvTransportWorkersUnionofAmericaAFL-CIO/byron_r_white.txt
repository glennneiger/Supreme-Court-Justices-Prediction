justice
byron
r.
white
the
employer,
however,
is
the
one
who
pays
the
wages
or
the
salaries
and
do
you
only
have
to
prove
that
the
union
violated
one
of
these
statutes
to
prove
some
kind
of
loss
by
the
employee
because
of
the
union
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
all
right,
so
let's
assume
both
of
them,
both
employer
and
union,
have
violated
title
vii.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
automatically
say
then
that
the
union
has
caused
part
of
the
loss
of
the
employee,
or
all
of
it,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
not
only
have
to
prove
a
violation
but
you
also
have
to
prove
that
the
union
really
was
responsible
for
the
employer's
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
some
or...
but
the
union
can
be
made
to
contribute
only
to
the
extent
that
it
did
cause
the
employer
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes
but
my
question
is,
when
you
go
back,
if
you
are
entitled
to
contribution,
what
must
you
prove
to
get
any
contribution?
you
must
prove
a
violation
and
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
union,
and
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
just
going
to
sit
there,
and
operate
in
the
blue.
it's
going
to
require
some
proof
by
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
the
relative
contribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
would
happen,
what
have
courts
done,
if
the
person
asking
the
contribution
proves
the
violation
and
then
just
rests?
will
the
court
just
say
automatically,
we
divide?
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
you
may
not
sue.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
if
it's
too
tough,
you
may
not
sue.
justice
white
and
if
both
the
employer
and
the
union
had
been
sued
in
this
case,
it's
possible
that
a
judgment
would
have
been
entered
against
both
of
them.
justice
white
i
said
it's
possible;
it's
possible.
justice
white
and
couldn't
have
submitted
a
claim
to
the
eeoc.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
file
a
charge
that
the
union
has
been
discriminating
against
the
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
what's
the
kind
of
a
charge
you're
suggesting
they
must
file.
justice
white
well,
that's
a
matter
of
defense,
isn't
it,
on
the
merits?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you...
i'm
sorry,
you
didn't
finish
your
answer.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i...
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
at
least
before
the
employer
should
be
able
to
get
into
court
he
should
make
his
complaint
before
the
eeoc?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
eeoc
then
gives
him
a
right
to
sue
letter,
i
suppose
you
would
say
he
could
get
into
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
that...
do
you
say
he
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he's...
if
he's
got
grave
doubts
about
that,
you
wouldn't
say,
then,
that
the
thing
that
bars
this
particular
suit
is
his
failure
to
file
with
the
eeoc?
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
exclusive
in
the
sense
that
the
only
person
who
is
permitted
to
claim
that
the
union
violated
the
act
is
the
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
say
that
an
employer
can't
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
can't
file,
it
isn't
outside
the
scheme.
congress
hasn't
provided
any
scheme
for
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
right.
if
it
has,
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
file
and
get
his
right
to
sue
letter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
then
that
you...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
then
conceive
that
the
employee
could
choose
them
both
and
sue
them,
and
get
judgment
against
both
of
them
in
one
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose...
do
you
think
it
would
be...
suppose
there's
a
judgment
entered
against
both
the
union
and
the
employer,
in
a
suit
by
the
employee,
after
he's
gone
through
the
eeoc
and
got
his
right
to
sue
letter,
and
there's
a
judgment
entered
against
them
both,
and
the
judge
says,
each
one
of
you
is
liable
for
the
total
amount,
but
i
am
going
to
order
you
two
defendants
to
share
the
liability.
would
that
be
inappropriate
under
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
can,
then...
each
one
of
them
is
totally
liable
for
the
entire
amount,
but
the
judge
then
says
to
the
two
defendants,
i
am
going
to
order
you
to
share
the
payment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
both
defendants
say,
neither
one
of
us
wants
to
have
to
pay
this
entire
judgment
and
so
they
both,
the
judge
orders
them
to
share
it.
is
that
an
appropriate
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
could
litigate
it,
they
could
litigate
their
respective
responsibilities.
justice
byron
r.
white
do,
you
think
it
takes
a
statute
to
have
a
contribution
in
federal
courts,
at
all,
in
any
kind
of
a
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
courts
aren't
entitled
to
enforce
contribution
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
so-called?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wallace,
has
the
united
states
taken
a
position
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
employer
could
file
a
complaint
against
a
union
in
a
case
like
this
with
the
eeoc?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
one
now,
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
provision
in
the
act
that...
you
don't
think
the
employer
on
his
own...
could
complain
that
he's
been
forced
to
violate
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
let's...
well,
you
say,
yes,
be
could
file
a
complaint.
and
the
eeoc
is
supposed
to
act
on
it?
it
may,
in
the
normal
way
complaints
are
acted
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
person,
or
including
the
employer
who
files
the
complaint
or
files
whatever
he
files
hasn't
any
right
himself
to
invoke
the
commission's
action,
like
an
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
take
a
position,
you
do
take
the
position
that
the
employer
has
no
right
to
file
a
charge
with
a
commissioner?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
employer,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
is
saying,
is
claiming
that
he's
being
forced
to
discriminate.
against
his
own
employees,
then,
if
he
sticks
to
them.
justice
white
well,
how
it
could
it
rule
any
other
way
than
that
it's
a
proper--
justice
white
--well,
suppose
it
decided
that
it
could
not
file
at
all,
the
employer
could
not
file
at
all.
do
you
think
the
employer
then
has
no
remedy
whatsoever
against
the
union?
apparently
that's
your
position,
i
gather
as
i
read
your
brief.
justice
white
making
that
sort
of
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
sooner
or
later,
the
employer
should
be
able
to
get
a
right
to
sue
under.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
you
may
not
call
it
contribution
but
you'd
have
a
statutory
action
against
the
union.
justice
white
well,
maybe
an
employer
has
never
tried.
justice
white
so
that
you
just...
you
recited
it,
the
commission
said
for
the
first
time
we've
been
asked
about
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
as
soon
as
they're
asked
about
it,
they
say
yes.
the
commission
said
a
lot
of
things
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it's
now
changed
its
tune
on.
justice
white
except
the
court
of
appeals,
in,
this
case.
justice
white
this
is
in
the
maritime?
