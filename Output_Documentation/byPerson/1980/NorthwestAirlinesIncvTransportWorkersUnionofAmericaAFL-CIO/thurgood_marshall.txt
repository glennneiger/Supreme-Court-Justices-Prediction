isn't
it
the
complaint
of
the
airline
that
they
were
willing
to
do
right
in
1966
and
the
union
stopped
them
from
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
but
if
they
get
a
chance
that's
what
they
claim
they
want
to
prove.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
is
that
if
two
people,
two
joint
statute
violators
get
together
and
take
it
out
on
an
individual
worker,
that
the
individual
worker
has
a
right
to
decide
who
he's
going
to
sue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
there's
no
remedy
against--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
don't
care;
is
there
a
remedy?
that's
what
i
asked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean,
how
does...
if
he
only
chooses
one--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--how
does
one
have
a
chance
to
get
a
remedy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
statute,
rule,
or
regulation
gives
this
remedy
to
the
employer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he's...
to
use
the
vernacular
of
the
street,
he's
stuck?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he's
stuck
solely
at
the
will
of
the
employee.
the
employee
decides,
who
i
like,
i'll
sue
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
do
under
erie
if
they
were
from
nonresidents?
the
erie
v.
tompkins
case,
a
negligence
case
based
on
an
automobile
accident
in
new
york,
sued
in
california.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
order
mutual
help,
could
you
say
that
we
can
order
you
to
share
the
costs
or
expenses
as
joint
tortfeasors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
quite...
what
worries
me...
and
i
realize
your
time's
up;
just
one
point...
what
worries
me
is,
i
don't
see
why
this
case
is
completely
controlled
by
either
the
equal
pay
act
or
title
vii.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
completely.
you
understand...
completely.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
a
shipowner
sues
a
stevedore
company
because
they
were
found
guilty
and
it
wasn't
maybe
them,
it
was
the
stevedore
company.
would
they
be
bound
by
maritime
law
or
general
federal
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--think
you
did
something
wrong,
when
you
conspired--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--what
if
by
putting
on
perjured
testimony
i
was
found
guilty
instead
of
you,
can
i
sue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
matter
what
kind
of
case
it
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i
say
that
your
perjury
caused
me
to
lose
a
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
i
think
that's...
i
just
don't
see
why
we
have
to
look
solely
to
those
two.
and
i
emphasize
solely,
underscored.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
this
time
don't
you
agree
that
northwest
has
no
interest
in
these
statutes
at
all,
they're
interested
in
$32
million
bucks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
weren't
there
when
the
commission
made
up
its
mind?
