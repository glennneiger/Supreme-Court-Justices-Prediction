mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1942
this
court
in
solo
electric
company
v.
jefferson
electric
company,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
by
chief
justice
stone
observed,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
173
of
volume
317:
"when
a
federal
statute
condemns
an
act
as
unlawful,
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
legal
consequences
of
the
condemnation,
though
left
by
the
statute
to
judicial
determination,
are
nevertheless
federal
questions,
the
answers
to
which
are
to
be
derived
from
the
statute
and
the
federal
policy
which
it
has
adopted.
"
this
observation
serves
as
a
reminder
that
in
many
fields
there
would
be
no
federal
law
and
no
federal
rights
if
congress
had
not
legislated
in
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
power.
in
the
absence
of
such
legislation
no
federal
common
law
would
govern
labor
relations
or
the
field
of
fair
employment
practices
in
the
private
sector.
the
legal
consequences
of
the
congressional
entry
into
this
field
must
therefore
flow
from
the
pertinent
federal
statutes
themselves,
expressly
or
by
implication.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
thought
letter
of
the
position
that
it
took.
it's
not
a
complete
reversal,
because
the
commission
opposed
the
contribution
claim
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
on
grounds
that
would
have
permitted
contribution
claims
in
some
other
circumstances
as
compatible
with
title
vii.
upon
further
consideration
of
the
question,
in
consultation
with
counsel,
the
commission
has
thought
better
of
its
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
but
this
is
not
an
unusual
proceeding.
it
was
a
proceeding
in
which--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
were
deliberating
litigation
policies,
the
position
to
be
taken
in
litigation,
this
very
case.
and
that
is
ordinarily
closed
to
the
public.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
the
position
that
the
commission
is
now
taking
on
having
reexamined
the
question.
it's
also
the
position
that
the
united
states
is
taking,
and
never,
having
taken
a
contrary
position,
filing--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
commission
appeared
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
own.
it
has
its
own
litigative
authority
in
all
courts
but
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
were
not,
at
that
time.
the
commission
did
consult
with
the
department
of
justice
with
respect
to
the
position
to
be
taken
in
this
brief,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
commission's
position
before
this
court
is
the
position
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
quite
different
with
respect
to
title
vii.
the
commission
took
no
position
with
respect
to
the
equal
pay
act
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
filed
a
brief...
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can
say
that
since
there
is
now
provision
for
commissioner
complaints
to
be
issued,
any
member
of
the
public
including
an
employer
can
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
or
of
a
commissioner
an
alleged
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
in
that
manner.
the
employer
was
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
not
a
charge,
when
somebody
brings
to
the
attention
of
a
commissioner.
it
enables
the
commissioner
if
he
sees
fit
to
do
so
to
file
a
commissioner
charge;
it
would
be
comparable
to
bringing
a
charge
before
the
national
labor,
relations
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
so
far
as
i'm
aware.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i'm
aware.
i
don't
know
if
the
commission
has
ruled
on
this
question,
and
i
hesitate
to
commit
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
it
could.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
whether
it's
a
person
aggrieved.
unions
do
file
charges
regularly
and
have
brought
suits
regularly,
but
this
is
on
behalf
of
their
members.
they're
essentially
class
suits
alleging
that
their
members
are
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
really
know
how
the
commission
would
rule
on
this.
i
don't
know
if
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
hesitate
to
commit
the
commission
on
something
that
it
may
not
have
decided.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
no
remedies
for
damages.
that
isn't--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
our
argument
is...
any
right
to
contribution
has
to
be
derived
from
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
hypothetical
mr.
justice
white
poses
might
be
the
basis
for
an
employer
charge
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
that
the
union
is
insisting
in
bargaining
or
in
striking
on
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i'm
informed
that
the
eeoc
has
voted
that
an
employer
can
file
a
charge.
i
don't
have
the
citation
to
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
have
the
citation
to
the
case.
i
don't
know
the
case.
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
don't
know
whether
the
commission's
interpretation
has
been--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
our
position,
that
neither
statute
expressly
or
by
implication
applying
the
proper
standards
to
whether
there's
an
implied
remedy
for
contribution,
would
support
a
remedy
for
contribution,
that
it
wouldn't
be
compatible
with
the
remedial
scheme,
or
the
remedial
theory,
of
either
statute
for
reasons
that
we've
set
out
in
our
brief,
and
that
i
won't
have
time
to
elaborate
on.
but
we
do
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
don't
think
the
employer
has
a
right
to
bring
the
union
into
the
case
at
an
earlier
stage
either,
if
the
union
has
not
been
charged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
unless
the
employer
who's
filing
a
charge
can
bring
about
to
itself
a
right
to
sue
the
union.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
the
complainants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
have
been,
under
title
vii.
perhaps
not
under
the
equal
pay
act.
that's
an
open
question,
whether
there's
a
private
remedy
against
unions
under
the
equal
pay
act.
that's
a
question
that
the
commission
has
not
yet
resolved.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
