mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
employer
that
has
been
held
responsible
for
paying
back
pay
under
the
employment
discrimination
statutes
because
of
the
wage
differential
among
various
categories
of
employees
may
serve
a
claim
for
contribution
against
the
labor
unions
that,
according
to
the
complaint
in
the
case,
regularly
bargained
for
and
indeed
demanded
the
preservation
of
that
differential.
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
are
briefed
extensively
by
the
parties
and
by
the
various
amici
curiae
who
have
supported
one
side
or
the
other.
in
my
argument
this
afternoon
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
three
major
themes.
they
are,
in
sum,
first,
that
this
is
not
an
implied
right
of
action
case
and
that
the
discussion
about
the
extent
to
which
the
court
should
be
implying
rights
of
action
where
there
is
congressional
silence
is
not
an
apt
controversy
here.
this
is
a
question
of
developing
a
remedy
to
allocate
liability
that
already
exists
under
developed
legal
doctrines.
secondly--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i
think
there
are
two
fundamental
aspects
of
the
implied
right
of
action
cases,
as
this
court
has
been
debating
them
over
the
past
few
terms
that
distinguish
them
from
this
case.
as
justice
powell's
dissenting
opinion
in
cannon,
for
example,
makes
clear,
the
implied
right
of
action
cases
involve
an
effort
to
invite
the
courts
to
create
statutory
liability,
monetary
liability,
where
congress
has
not
explicitly
fastened
liability
on
the
defendant.
secondly,
those
cases,
as
justice
powell
points
out,
necessarily
involve
assertion
of
federal
question
jurisdiction
over
disputes
that
would
not
otherwise
be
assigned
by
congress
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
as
i'll
explain
in
this
case,
justice
rehnquist,
what
we
have
here
is
a
claim
that
turns
upon
a
premise
that
congress
has
already
created
the
financial
liability
for
unions,
that
northwest
is
seeking
to
share.
so
far
it
has
been
ordered
to
pay
the
exclusive
portion
of
the
liability.
so
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
new
liability
is
being
created.
secondly,
this
kind
of
allocation--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--but
it
has
created
liability
to
the
employees,
and
that's
the--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--but,
your
honor,
as
i
will
explain--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes;
what
we
have
here,
though,
is
a
situation
in
which,
if
both
defendants
had
been,
sued
together...
that
is,
if
the
employer
and
the
union
had
been
joined
in
a
suit,
or
if
the
employer
had
been
sued
alone
and
had
impleaded
the
unions,
there
seems
to
be
little
question
that
under
case
law
that
this
court
has
developed
as
well
as
cases
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
that
there
would
have
been
a
right
of
allocation
of
that
liability.
that's
what
the
lower
courts
have
held
rather
consistently,
and
in
this
court
in
somewhat
similar
settings.
this
obviously
is
the
first
time
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
decide
this--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes.
and
the
predicate
for
that
argument,
justice
stevens--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i
am
thinking,
for
example,
of
justice
white's
opinions
in
czosek
v.
o'mara,
and
vaca
v.
sipes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
justice
white's
opinions
for
the
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i'm
sorry?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
these
are
cases
in
which
the
court
has
already
said--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--i
think
it's
an
excellent
decision.
these
are
decisions,
though,
in
which
the
court
has
already
said
that
where
one
or
both
concurrent
tortfeasors
are
sued,
the
courts
have
a
federal
common
law
responsibility
to
develop
remedies
that
will
fairly
allocate
the
liability
according
to
the
relative
degrees
of
fault.
that
assumes
that
there
is
existing
liability
under
some
doctrine
of
law.
i
shall
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
in
this
kind
of
case
liability
for
unions
for
the
conduct
alleged
here
is
clear
under
title
vii.
no
one
disputes
that
the
unions
have
that
title
vii
liability.
i
can
also
attempt
to
demonstrate
and,
i
hope,
persuade
the
court,
that
unions
also
have
liability
for
conduct
that
violates
the
equal
protection
act.
their
own
duties--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--excuse
me,
the
equal
pay
act,
for
conduct
that
violates
their
own
independent
duties
under
the
equal
pay
act.
so,
that's
the
first
point.
conceptually,
i
think
that
cort
v.
ash
and
its
progeny
in
the
debate
over
implied
rights
of
actions
does
not
really
focus
the
court
on
the
proper
set
of
cases.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
it's
explicit.
i
shall
attempt
to
explain
as
we
lay
out
in
our
briefs,
in
some
detail,
why
we
think,
as
correctly
understood,
that
congress
did
intend
under
the
equal
pay
act
to
permit
direct
suits
by
employees
from
union
violations.
but
in
any
event,
that
is
not
relevant
to
northwest's
contribution
claim,
because
any
union
conduct
that
violates
the
equal
pay
act's
bar
on
unions
causing
employers
to
discriminate
by
paying
unequal
wages,
constitutes
also
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
a
violation
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
under
either
of
those
two
duties,
unions
would
have
financial
liability
for
that
misconduct.
and
it
is
a
settled
principle
of
contribution
that
the
government
itself
acknowledges
in
its
amicus
brief
that
contribution
may
be
asserted
by
one
wrongdoer
against
another
even
when
the
source
of
their
misconduct
and
financial
liability
is
different:
one,
for
example,
arising
under
statute;
another
arising...
and
this
is,
again,
to
repair
to
justice
white's
opinions
for
the
courts
in
those
two
cases...
the
situation
in
which
the
union's
breach
is
a
breach
of
its
federal
common
law
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
was
mooted
in
the
court
of
appeals.
our
position
is,
in
accordance
with
traditional
law,
that
a
contribution
suit
is
a
wholly
separate
claim,
and
indeed,
this
is
the
orthodox
principle,
that
a
contribution
claim
is
an
equitable
right
that
normally
is
asserted
only
after
one
wrongdoer
has
paid
more
than
his
fair
share
of
the
judgment.
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--violation
in
any
sort
of
tortious
duty,
including
a
statute.
what
we
have
here
alleged
is
a
statutory
violation
engaged
in
by
northwest,
violation
of
both
the
equal
pay
act
and
title
vii.
we
have
contended
that
the
union's
conduct
as
alleged
in
paragraph
6
of
the
complaint
also
constituted
a
violation
of
its
independent
responsibilities
under
title
vii,
under
the
equal
pay
act,
and
necessarily
under
its
common
law
duty
of
fair
representations.
any
of
those
three,
but
at
least
two
of
those
three,
without
question
created
financial
liability
to
the
union
for,
as
the
complaint
alleges,
regularly
demanding
the
preservation
of
this
differential.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
that's
an
essential
ingredient
in
the
facts
of
the
case
here.
we
have
alleged
that
at
all
times
from
the
late
1940s
up
through
the
laffey
lawsuit,
the
underlying
class
action
that
was
brought
only
against
northwest,
each
of
these
two
unions
in
turn
represented
all
of
the
cabin
attendants
employed
by
northwest,
the
higher
paid
five
percent
who
were
pursers
and
were
virtually
all
male,
and
the
lower
paid
categories,
the
female
stewardesses,
the
male
stewards,
and
flight
service
attendants.
and
we
allege
that
at
each
round
of
bargaining
the
union
came
to
the
table
and
demanded
the
perpetuation,
and
indeed,
the
enlargement
of
that
differential.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
has
to
be
a
determination
that
one
job
is
occupied
by
people
of
one
sex
and
the
other
is
occupied
by
people
of
another;
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that
is
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
on
the
merits.
and
the
lower
court
cases
under
title
vii
dealing
with
analogous
situations
are
fairly
clear
and
their
cite
is
blanton
in
our
brief,
justice
stewart.
they
establish
that
a
union
is
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
a
discriminatory
contract
if
the
results
of
the
contract
in
operation
are
discrimination,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
terms
are
themselves
facially
discriminatory.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
as
pursers?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
the
higher-paid;
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
will
be
an
issue
for
the--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
kind
of
factor
may
be
relevant
to
the
determination
of
relative
fault
in
the
allocation
of
liability.
we
on
remand,
if
the
court
permits
this
case
to
go
back
for
trial,
will
have
to
prove
that
the
unions'
conduct
vis-a-vis
northwest
airlines
and
vis-a-vis
the
laffey
plaintiffs,
the
class
in
that
underlying
suit,
constituted
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
the
equal
pay
act,
or
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
if
we're
not
able
to
demonstrate
that,
then,
of
course,
the
contribution...
comes
out.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that's
correct.
only
sex
discrimination
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that's
right.
but
as
you
know
the
bennett
amendment
to
title
vii
was
intended
to
make
the
two
statutes
congruent
so
that
any
conduct
that
violates
the
equal
pay
act
necessarily
violates
title
vii.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
case
law
is
fairly
uniform
on
that,
justice
white,
and
it
is
to
the
effect
that
title
vii
expressly
imposes
an
independent
duty
on
the
unions
to
root
out--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes,
sir.
and
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
in
cases
like
that,
either
where
the
union--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--generally,
what
the
lower
courts
have
done
is
to
look
to
the
dynamics
of
bargaining.
in
some
cases
they
have
said
the
union
was
principally
or
primarily
or
exclusively
responsible
for
that
discriminatory--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--to
some
degree.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
cause
is
one
of
the
two
statutory
provisions
that
may
give
rise
to
union
liability.
under
703(c)(3)
it's
illegal
for
a
union--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--we
must
prove
a
violation
by
the
union.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
and
the
federal
court
exercising
equity
will
determine
what
the
relative
fault--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
is
what
federal
courts
have
done.
this
is
not
a
novel
issue.
this
has
been
litigated
many
times,
and
what
the
courts
look
to
is,
for
example,
the
origin
of
the
disputed
provision,
the
incentive
for
it,
for
its
retention,
the
efforts
that
may
have
been
made
by
one
or
the
other
of
the
parties
to
eliminate
it.
and
i
should
note
that
it
is
undisputed
that
in
1966
northwest
proposed
to
eliminate
the
differential
in
this
case
and
the
union
refused
to
go
along
with
that.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
still
some
discussion
in
the
lower
courts
about
whether
or
not
there
is
to
be
pro
rata
contribution.
that
has
not
been
what
the
federal
courts
have
done
in
employment
discrimination
cases.
they
have
looked
to
relative
fault,
which
is,
as
you
know
from
the
opinions
we
have
discussed,
what
this
court
has
suggested
is
the
proper
federal
common
law
rule
of
allocation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
this
is
pretty
straightforward.
it's
only
a
single
provision,
but--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--to
the
union.
we
must
demonstrate,
first,
that
the
union
signed
the
contract.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
secondly,
that
it
operated
in
a
way
that
would
discriminate.
and
thirdly,
that
the
union
bears
responsibility
for
that
discrimination.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
would
have
to
be
litigated.
that
is
not
a
terribly
complicated
issue.
these
negotiations
dealt
with
a
number
of
different
terms,
naturally,
but
the
focus
of
a
trial
under
the
federal
rules
will
be
confined
to
what
are
the
material
issues.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
have
no
idea
what
the
union's
defense
will
be
on
the
merits,
but
again,
that's
an
issue
that
i
can
only
speculate
on
at
this
point.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
on
which
we
rely
very
heavily.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
that
was
after
trial.
what
happened
in
the
glus
case,
which
is
the
opinion
to
which
he
is
referring,
justice
stewart,
is
that
a
suit
was
brought
there
against
the
employer
and
some
unions
who
had
been
charged
before
the
eeoc
as
well
as
some
unions
that
had
not
been
charged
by
the
eeoc.
the
employer
and
the
unions
asserted
crossclaims,
in
effect,
for
contribution.
the
employer
then
settled,
and
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
employer
could
then
go
forward
against
the
unions
to
perfect
its
crossclaims
which
then
became
contribution
claims
for
a
portion
of
the
amount
for
which
the
employer
had
settled
with
the
aggrieved
employees.
and
that
was
what
judge
higginbotham's
opinion
for
the
3rd
circuit
sustained,
that
there
is
such
a
right
of
contribution
and
that
essentially
it
had
been
properly
tried
and
resolved
in
that
case.
that
is
just
one
illustration
of
a
number
of
cases
that
we
cite
in
our
briefs
in
which
the
federal
courts
have
found
this
question
of
allocation
of
relative
liability
a
fairly
straightforward
problem
dealing
with--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--it
may
involve
that.
we
don't
know.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there's
no
doubt
that
the
contribution
claimant
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
that,
and
if
it's
too
complicated
and
the
stakes
are
not
sufficiently
high,
an
employer
may
not
assert
a
contribution
claim.
all
we're
trying
to
demonstrate
is
that
we
have
the
right
to
get
through
the
courthouse
door.
my
answer
to
justice
brennan
and
you,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
this
case
is
not
necessarily,
this
type
of
case
is
not
necessarily
any
more
complicated
than
an
underlying
employment
discrimination
case
or
many
of
the
other
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
is
an
undertaking
that
the
courts
have
found
answerable
in
some
cases.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
premise
of
contribution,
which
as
we
emphasize
is
now
the
prevailing
american
rule,
is
that
the
plaintiff
making
the
contribution
claim
is
a
wrongdoer.
the
pari
delicto
doctrine
has
not
been
thought
to
be
lingeringly
sufficient
to
insist
upon
the
old
common
law
rule.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
however
it's
characterized,
the
courts,
including
this
court,
and
on
every
occasion
on
which
it's
addressed
contribution,
having
knowledge
that
contribution
among
concurrent
tortfeasors
is
the
fairer
modern
rule.
the
only
cases
in
which
the
court
has
refused
to
apply
it
are
cases
in
which
it
is
found
that
there
would
be
some
conflict
between
a
specific
federal
statutory
policy
and
what
is
now
recognized
to
be
the
fairer
american
rule.
the
lower
courts
in
this
context,
the
employment
discrimination
contribution
context,
are
virtually
uniform.
we
cite,
i
think,
more
than
a
dozen
cases
in
which
district
judges
all
over
the
country,
the
people
who
have
to
try
these
cases,
have
sustained
the
legal
validity
of
contribution
claims,
recognizing
that
it
involves
an
undertaking
on
their
part
as
the
triers
of
fact
to
determine
whether
the
contract
was
discriminatory
and
to
what
extent
the
union
had
some
complicity.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
that's
correct.
if
this
were
simply
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
should
have
a
larger
or
smaller
workload,
of
course
we
would
have
abandoned
this
case
long
since.
what
you
find,
though,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
widespread
criticism
of
the
heartbalm
statutes
on
policy
grounds
is
exactly
the
converse
of
what
we
have
here,
where
all,
i'd
say,
with
the
exception
of
the
government's
latest
position
before
this
court,
all
of
the
informed
commentary
by
the
judges,
by
the
eeoc
and
the
court
below,
just...
at
least
two
of
the
eeoc
commissioners
today...
is
that
contribution
ought
to
be
sustained
in
general,
as
the
fairer
principle.
and
that
in
particular,
contribution
ought
to
be
extended
to
the
employment
discrimination
statutes,
as
the
courts
for
the
last
12
years
have
regularly
done
so.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
might
i
suggest
in
response
to
that
point
that
you
may
very
well
find
that
if
you
implement
a
contribution
remedy
as
the
lower
courts
have
been
willing
to
do,
you
will
find
that
the
congressional
plan,
as
this
court
itself
identified
it
in
albemarle
paper
company
v.
moody,
will
reduce
rather
than
increase
the
number
of
employment
discrimination
suits.
this
court--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--or
at
least
will
have
the
independent
incentive
to
complain
when
the
employers
attempt
to
do
them.
either
way,
this
court
in
albemarle
said...
and
this
is
the
court's
own
phrase,
"it
is
the
reasonably
certain
prospect
of
a
back
pay
award
that
congress
intended
to
be
the
spur
or
catalyst
to
cause
employers
and
unions
to
root
out
discriminatory
employment
practices.
"
what
the
lower
courts
have
said,
and
justice
stewart
referred
to
judge
higginbotham's
recent
opinion,
that
opinion
finds,
as
did
the
district
court
in
this
case,
and
the
eeoc
two
years
ago
and
two
commissioners
today,
that
making
this
back
pay
prospect
a
realistic
one,
something
that
will
be
achieved
through
contribution,
and
it
will
be
undermined
through
a
no
contribution
rule,
will
achieve
the
congressional
goal
of
eliminating
employment
discrimination
at
the
bargaining
table,
so
that
there
won't
be
the
need
to
come
into
court
so
often
to
bring
back
pay
suits
on
behalf
of
employees.
i
think
that's
a
fair,
reasonable
prediction.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
full
responsibility
for
this
practice
lies
at
the
feet
of
the
union
mr.
chief
justice.
what
title
vii,
and
indeed,
the
equal
pay
act
recognize,
what
other
courts
have
recognized,
is
that
this
is
a
collaborative
venture.
sometimes
the
initiative
comes
from
one
side,
sometimes
from
the
other.
but
the
best
way
to
root
out
discrimination
in
employment
is
for
both
sides
to
have
an
incentive
through
the
certain
or
reasonably
certain
prospect
of
a
back
pay
award.
to
say,
i
won't
propose
a
discriminatory
arrangement,
and
if
you
propose
it,
i
will
resist
it,
because
i
will
have
responsibility
if
i
go
along
with
it.
that's
the
congressional
plan.
that's
what
we
think
a
contribution
remedy
would
enforce,
that's
why
the
lower
courts
two
years
ago,
the
eeoc
forcefully
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
today
two
commissioners
still
insisting
this
is
the
best
way
to
achieve
that
congressional
design.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
justice
stevens,
$37
million
is
the
figure
today.
the
judgment
was
affirmed
in
part
and
vacated
in
part
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1976,
and
was
remanded
certain
further
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
two
months
ago
on
a
related
appeal
in
the
laffey
case
that
that
1974
judgment
was
not
a
final
judgment,
because
of
the
things
that
remain
to
be
done
about
other
aspects
of
the
case.
so
the
judgment
has
not
yet
been
paid.
$37
million
is
our
estimate
of
the
liability
today
with
interest.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
has
been
so
found
by
the
district
court
after
a
three-week
trial
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.
we
intend...
and
i
should
alert
the
court
to
this...
to
bring
the
case
back
up
here
on
the
questions
of
liability
if
we
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
commission,
in
response
to
this
colloquy
about
whether
an
employer
may
conceivably
be
an
aggrieved
party
entitled
to
file
a
charge,
did
adopt
the
position
that
mr.
wallace
acknowledged.
this
is
printed
on
page
12a
of
our
reply
brief.
this
is
from
the
commision's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
commision
said
that
for
the
first
time
it
faced
that
question
when
it
was
asked
by
the
court
of
appeals
what
its
position
was
on
contribution.
and
it
said
that
the
commission
believes
that
in
certain
circumstances
an
employer
might
be
able
to
file
a
charge
as
an
aggrieved
party.
that
is
eight
years
after
the
charges
were
filed
against
northwest,
and
i
submit
it
would
be
highly
inequitable
to
the
court
to
block
a
contribution
claim
on
the
basis
of
a
still
unsettled
and
unadjudicated--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--the
answer,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
i
don't
know.
not
until
eight
years
after
all
these
events
took
place
did
the
commision
ever
indicate
that
an
employer
could
file
a
charge.
as
far
as--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--as
far
as
we've
been
able
to
ascertain,
the
commission
in
the
16
years
since
that
statute
has
been
in
effect
has
never
entertained
a
charge
from
an
employer.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
entirely
possible.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
and
i
concede--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes,
sir.
my
principal
point,
though,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
this
discussion
about
whether
northwest
could
have
filed
the
charge
is
irrelevant,
as
the
3rd
circuit
held
in
the
glus
case,
and
as
the
other
federal
courts
have
held
in
sustaining
claims--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--yes.
my
submission,
justice
stevens,
is
that
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite,
and
that's
why
it's
irrelevant,
that's
what
the
lower
courts
have
held
when
they've
said
that
a
contribution
claim
really
is
a
federal
common
law
claim,
not
a
title
vii
claim.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
except
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
which
didn't
reach
the
title
vii
issue.
it
stopped
short
of
reaching
it.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--oh,
yes,
absolutely.
for
example,
cooper
stevedoring--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--cooper
stevedoring.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it's
in
the
maritime
field.
we
do
cite
other
cases
in
417.
--417
u.s.--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--thank
you.
