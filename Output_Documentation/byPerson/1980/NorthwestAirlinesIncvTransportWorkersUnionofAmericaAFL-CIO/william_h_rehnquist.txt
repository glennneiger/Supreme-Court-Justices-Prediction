william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
so
clear
i
see
the
distinction
for
what
you're
saying.
i
mean,
to
say
that
it's
a
way
of
developing
a
remedy
for
allocating
liability,
i
mean,
you
could
pretty
much
describe
implied
cause
of
action
that
way,
couldn't
you?

--heinz
v.
anchor
motor
freight
lines.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
equal
pay
act
specifically
makes
employers
liable
and
says
nothing
about
unions'
liability,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
whereas
title
vii
makes
both
liable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
contribution
action
a
separate
lawsuit
which
you
may
bring,
say,
two
or
three
years
after
you
paid
the
judgment?
or
is
it
one
in
which
you
must
implead
a
party
before
the
case
goes
to
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
remain
troubled
by
one
of
your
answers
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
that
it's
quite
simple
and
all
we
have
to
focus
on
is
this
one
provision
in
the
contract.
but
how
that
one
provision
came
to
be
in
the
contract
may
involve
a
very
complicated
history
of
negotiations
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
that
what
is
a
simple
issue
in
the
lawsuit
involves
very
complex
testimony
and
history
of
bargaining
within
the
industry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
their
dockets
would
be
a
lot
less
congested
if
they
didn't
undertake
this
kind
of
inquiry.
in
the
'30s
when
they
repealed
"heartbalm"
authorizations,
there
were
a
lot
less
lawsuits
filed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under,
the
46th
change
in
the
rules
where
the
defendant
could
no
longer
implead
someone
whom
he
said
was
equally
liable
and
could
only
implead
someone
who
he
said
was
liable
over
to
him,
the
plaintiff
has
its
choice
of
defendant,
in
effect,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
have
a
right
to
file
a
charge,
do
they
get
a
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
eeoc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
be
true
in
a
right-to-work
state,
would
it,
where
the
employee
might
not
be
a
member
of
the
union?
