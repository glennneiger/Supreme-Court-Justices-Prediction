justice
jr.
--well,
mr.
lacovara,
i
gather,
since
this
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
provision
is
the
one
that
creates
the
discrimination,
is
it
not,
in
violation
of
the
statute?
a
collectively
bargained
provision,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
are
you
suggesting
that
it
would
be
your
duty
on
either
trial
to
canvass
the
whole
procedure
in
collective
bargaining
which
led
to
the
adoption
agreement
upon
the
provisions?
justice
jr.
even
so,
you
said
that
you
had
somehow
to
bring
home
to
the
employer
some
kind
of
contribution
of
the
responsibility
for
the
provision,
didn't
you?
justice
jr.
well,
actually,
there
is.
you
have
the
agreement.
justice
jr.
all
right.
well,
on
that
last
inquiry,
don't
you
have
to
go
through
the
whole
process
of
collective
bargaining,
what
happened,
what
brought
about
the
agreement,
who
proposed
it.
justice
jr.
which
is
to
say,
northwest
could
not
have
brought
the
unions
into
the
laffey
suit?
justice
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
said.
your
view
is
that
they
could
not
have
brought
the
unions
in
anyway.
justice
jr.
and
what
would
the
suit
then
be,
if
they
get
the
right
to
sue?
what
would
it
take
the
form
of...
intervention
in
the
laffey
suit?
justice
jr.
well,
assume
he
can.
justice
jr.
so
the
right,
to
sue
would
be
authority
to
sue,
of
northwest,
directly
to
sue
the
unions,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
for
contribution,
for
contribution.
justice
jr.
but
what's
the
authority
that
a
judge
could
do
that,
namely,
say,
you
divide
it?
i
thought
that
took
a
statute?
justice
jr.
well,
but
are
conceding
that
it
does
take
a
statutory
authorization
for
a
court
to
do
that,
and
you're
arguing,
i
gather,
that
706(e),
is
it,
some
such
statutory
authority,
gives
such
tests
for
it?
justice
jr.
well,
no,
i
was
thinking
as
a
general
proposition.
i
had
supposed
if
they're
joint
tortfeasors,
there
can't
be
compelled
contribution
without
statutory
authorization.
isn't
that
right?
justice
jr.
i'm
talking
generally
about
the
law
of
contribution.
how
about
in
ordinary
negligence
cases?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
moldof's
position
was
precisely
that,
that
if
this
statute
doesn't
give
the
employer
a
right
to
sue
for
contribution,
then
there
simply
isn't
any
right
in
the
employer.
i
thought
that's
what
his
argument
was.
justice
jr.
from
this
very
statute?
justice
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
mr.
wallace,
do
i
understand
that
your
position
today
is
that
the
statute
provides,
no
authority
for
a
suit
for
contribution
by
the
employer
against
the
union
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
mr.
lacovara,
may
i
just
ask
you,
does
your
brief
cite
any
cases
in
this
court,
or
other,
federal
cases
for
that
matter,
which
have
held
that
there
may
be
a
suit
for
contribution
unless
there
is
statutory
authority
for
it?
justice
jr.
even
without
statutory
authority?
justice
jr.
all
right.
justice
jr.
well,
maritime's
a
little
unique,
isn't
it?
well,
anyway--
