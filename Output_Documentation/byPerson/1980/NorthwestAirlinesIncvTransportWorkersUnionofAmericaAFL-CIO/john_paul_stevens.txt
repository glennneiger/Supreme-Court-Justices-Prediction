justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
that's
a
valid
distinction,
because
it
has
not
expressly
created
liability
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
the
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
isn't
it
like
cannon
and
the
other
cases
that
the
question
was
whether
the
particular
plaintiff
could
get
recovery,
not
whether
the
defendant
might
be
liable
to
somebody
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
most
of
those
cases
assume
that
there's
some
legal
duty
owed
by
the
defendant
to
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
there
would
have
been
the
right
of
contribution?
you
say
right
of
allocation.
there
would
have
been
a
right
of
contribution
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
case
that
holds
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
just
about
the
mechanics
of
the
case?
in
the
early
part
of
your
brief
you
point
out
the
liability
was
fixed
somewhere
around
$37
million
back
in
1974.
was
that
judgment
ever
affirmed,
and
has
the
judgment
been
satisfied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
settled
in
that
litigation
that
the
purser's
job
was
equal
to
the
stewardess's
job,
the
cabin
attendant's
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
second
question
is,
whether
the
prolonged
period
of
disposing
of
that
litigation
has
been
affected
at
all
by
the
pendency
of
this
claim
for
contributions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
right?
isn't
there
a
subsection
that
says
it's
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
cause
or
attempt
to
cause
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
anyone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
the
question
whether
the
employer
would
be
a
person
aggrieved
if
he
alleged
during
some
negotiations
that
the
union
was
trying
to
cause
him
to
enter
into
a
discriminatory
contract?
say
an
employer,
while
bargaining
with
a
union,
alleged
a
violation
of
703(c)
and
said
it
was
a
person
aggrieved.
why
couldn't
it
file
the
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statutory
issue
is
whether
it's
a
person
aggrieved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
during
your
bargaining
negotiations,
and
this
is
in
substance
what
you
allege,
you
were
being
forced
by
the
union
to
enter
into
a
discriminatory
bargain,
couldn't
you
then
have
invoked
the
provisions
of
703(c)(3)...
whatever
it
is,
and
then
filed
your
charge
that,
don't
let
the
union
put
this
kind
of
pressure
on
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
has
been
there
all
the
time,
and
one
can
read
it,
and
it
says
that
a
person
aggrieved
can
file
a
charge.
and
if
you
were
aggrieved
under
that
section,
i
don't
know
why
you
couldn't
file
a
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
irrelevant
if
we
consider
it
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
litigating
under
title
vii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
to
these
two
cases,
northwest
airlines
against
the
transport
workers
union
of
america
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
airline
was
held
liable
to
the
class
of
female
cabin
attendants
for
backpay
because
wage
differentials
between
male
and
female
cabin
attendants
were
found
to
have
violated
the
equal
pay
act
of
1963
and
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
in
a
separate
proceeding
between
the
company
and
the
union,
the
company
contended
that
the
wage
differentials
were
the
product
of
collective
bargaining
with
the
union
and
that
the
union
should
share
the
responsibility
for
making
the
backpay
awards
to
the
female
cabin
attendants.
the
question
of
law
that
the
case
presents
is
whether
assuming
that
the
union
is
in
fact
partially
responsible
for
the
statutory
violations,
thus
the
company
have
a
right
of
contribution
requiring
that
the
union
share
in
the
payments
that
are
necessary
to
make
the
injured
employees
whole.
although
we
recognized
that
there
are
substantial
policy
reasons
that
support
the
company's
position,
we
conclude
that
the
statutes
of
congress
has
enacted
which
contain
elaborate
procedures
covering
various
contingencies
do
not
include
the
remedy
that
the
employer
seeks
and
it
is
not
therefore
within
our
authority
as
judges
to
add
a
remedy
to
the
statute.
we
also
hold
that
there
is
no
federal
common
law
contribution
remedy
that
would
provide
the
employer
relief
in
this
case.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
insofar
as
it
held
that
no
such
remedy
was
available
under
the
equal
pay
act
and
we
modify
its
judgment
insofar
as
it
left
open
the
question
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
