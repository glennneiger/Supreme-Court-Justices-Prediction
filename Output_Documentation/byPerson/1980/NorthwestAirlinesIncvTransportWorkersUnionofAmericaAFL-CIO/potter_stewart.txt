equal
pay
act?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
equal
pay
act
is
applicable
only
if
one
gender
is
paid
otherwise
from
another
gender
for
doing
the
same
job,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
differentials
between
two
different
jobs?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
union
had
nothing
to
do
with?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
on
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
these
briefs,
the
unions
at
least
urge
that
they
tried
hard
to
get
you
to
hire
females
as
stewards.
justice
potter
stewart
as
pursers.
justice
potter
stewart
as
pursers.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be...
it
would
be
premature,
you
submit,
for
us
to
consider
any
such
matter
at
this
time?
justice
stewart
the
title
vii
violation
was
also
premised,
in
the
laffey
case,
was
premised
upon
discrimination
based
upon
sex.
justice
stewart
and
that's
all
that's
covered
by
the
equal
pay
act,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you'll
have
a
swap-off
of
this
provision
for
giving
up
another
one,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
3rd
circuit
court
of
appeals,
judge
higginbotham
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court--
justice
potter
stewart
--on
which
you
rely
greatly.
and
understandably;
agreeing
with
you.
and
at
what
stage
was
that
written?
just
at
the
equivalent
stage
of
this
case?
justice
stewart
well,
neither
one
has
ever
been
sued.
justice
stewart
although,
certainly,
the
union
could
have
been
sued,
clearly,
under
title
vii,
i
would
say,
at
the
plaintiff's
option.
justice
stewart
and
certainly
no
court's
going
to
hold
them
liable
if
they're
not
sued.
justice
stewart
the
general
way
that
contribution
works
the
ordinary
law...
let's
take
two
joint
tortfeasors.
and
the
plaintiff
sues
only
one
of
them.
he's
the
one
and
he's
held
liable.
and
then
he
sues
his
joint
tortfeasor
for
a
contribution.
he's
not
claiming
that
the
joint
tortfeasor
wronged
him
but
only
that
the
joint
tortfeasor
should
share
the
liability
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
stewart
well,
it
is
a
contribution
case.
justice
stewart
that's
what
contribution
is.
justice
stewart
it's
not
a
claim
by
a
defendant
that
the
codefendant
wronged
him
in
any
independent
way,
but
only
that
the
codefendant
should
share
the
liability
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
stewart
well,
it
certainly
is.
but
your
point
is
that--
justice
stewart
--controversy.
justice
stewart
short
of
appeal,
in
justice
white's
hypothetical
case,
each
party
had
been
found
completely
liable.
justice
stewart
before
you
get
further
into
your
interesting
argument,
mr.
wallace,
could
you
tell
me
why
the
commission
has
completely
reversed
its
position
between
the
time
that
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
time
it's
here?
justice
stewart
it
did
so,
the
court
did
so
in
a
proceeding
that
was
closed
to
the
public
despite
demands
of
the
representatives
of
the
public
to
be
there,
by
a
3-2
vote,
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
i
just
wondered
if
you
were
free
to
tell
me
why?
justice
stewart
but...
and
so
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
say
why
except
you
just
think
this
is
a
better
position?
justice
stewart
they
didn't
take
any
position.
the
commission
appeared.
justice
stewart
it
seemed
to
me
very...
i
read
the
excerpts
from
your
brief
and
the
commission's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
appear
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
in
this
court.
it
seems
to
me,
if
it's
not
a
reversal
of
position,
it's
certainly
a
completely
different
position.
justice
stewart
and
it's
quite
different
from
the
one
that
was
taken
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stewart
no.
justice
stewart
so
it
could
have
been,
under
the
statute?
