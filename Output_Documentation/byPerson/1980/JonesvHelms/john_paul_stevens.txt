he
could
migrate.
well,
i
know,
i
know,
but
in
this
case,
the
claim
is
that
he
abandoned
the
child
and
then
left
the
state.
justice
stevens
mr.
bonner,
can
i
ask
you?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
position
on
one
thing.
assume
this
statute
said,
if
a
person
abandons
a
child,
and
thereafter,
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
prosecution,
leaves
the
state,
it
would
be
a
felony;
otherwise,
a
misdemeanor.
would
you
say
that
was
constitutional?
justice
stevens
so,
your
whole
argument
turns
on
the
absence
of
intent?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
promiscuous
in
the
sense
that
it
applies
when
there's
no
intent.
justice
stevens
except
that
it
would
be
after
having
committed
an
offense?
justice
stevens
that's
all
he
did.
after
having
committed
an
offense.
justice
stevens
after
having
committed
the
first
element
of
a
two
element
offense?
but
the
reason
it's
a
felony,
not
a
misdemeanor,
is
because
he
left
the
state
of
georgia.
had
he
not
left
the
state
of
georgia,
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
justice
stevens
what
if
a
statute
said
that
it
shall
be
a
crime
to
escape
from
prison;
shall
be
a
misdemeanor,
say,
to
escape
from
prison?
and
if
after
escaping,
if,
for
any
reason,
you
leave
the
state,
even
if
not
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
prosecution,
that
shall
be
a
felony.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
stevens
how's
it
different?
justice
stevens
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
constitutional
for
georgia
to
pass
a
statute
that
said,
if
a
parent
abandons
a
child,
that
parent
may
not
leave
the
state?
justice
stevens
what
they've
done
here
is
something
less
extreme.
they've
said,
if
you
leave
you
get
a
more
severe
penalty.
or
if
a
parent
abandons
a
child,
he
may
not
leave
the
state.
if
he
violates
this
restriction
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony.
justice
stevens
no,
he's
not
charged.
one
who
abandons
his
child...
and
i
guess
there's
an
intent
element
in
the
abandonment
offense
itself...
may
not
thereafter
leave
the
state
of
georgia.
justice
stevens
georgia
couldn't
do
that?
justice
stevens
that's
not
an
equal
protection
problem,
that's
just
a
flat
violation
of
the
right
to
travel,
to
impose
that
restriction
on
a
person
who
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
but
you
say
he
could
do
it
if
he
escapes
from
prison.
you'd
say,
well,
you'd
say,
he
can't
leave
the
state.
justice
stevens
well,
by
hypothesis,
here,
one
who
abandons
a
child
knows
he's
abandoned
the
child.
justice
stevens
well,
he's
not
guilty
unless
he
willfully
and
voluntarily
abandons
the
child.
justice
stevens
those
who
willfully
abandon
their
children.
justice
stevens
same
group
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
mr.
bonner,
do
i
understand
your
argument
really
doesn't
rest
on
the
fact
that
it's
an
abandonment
case?
say
it
was
a
case
involving
it's
a
misdemeanor
to
shoot
wildlife,
shoot
a
bird
or
a
deer
or
something
like
that,
but
if
one
does
that
and
thereafter
leaves
the
state
it's
a
felony.
you'd
make
the
same
argument
with
that
kind
of
statute?
justice
stevens
same
thing?
yes.
