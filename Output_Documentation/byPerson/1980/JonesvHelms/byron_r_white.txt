justice
white
or
intend
to
in
the
course
of
leaving
the
state,
or
intend
to
abandon
the
child
later?
justice
white
this
applies
whether
you
abandon
after
you've
left
the
state
or
before?
justice
white
i
understand.
justice
white
i
understand.
justice
white
do
you
have
a
general
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
flee
from
justice,
or
to
abscond,
or
to
leave
the
state?
what
if
you're
under
indictment
and
you
leave
the
state?
is
that
a
separate
crime?
justice
white
but
isn't
that...
that's
not
unheard
of,
though,
around
the
country,
is
it?
justice
white
how
about...
is
that
a
crime
in
your
state,
to
violate
your
bail?
justice
white
because
then
you're
just...
need
a
rational
basis.
justice
white
well,
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
whether
that's
unconstitutional,
to
make
the
abandonment
a
felony
if
he's
left
the
state.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be...
i
suppose
you
would
say
it
would
be
just
as
unconstitutional
if
they
made
it
a
misdemeanor
to
abandon
the
child
and
another
misdemeanor
to
leave
the
state
after
having
abandoned
the
child?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
it
would
certainly
bear
on
the
right
to
travel,
wouldn't
it?
if
you
left
the
state
you've
committed
another
misdemeanor.
justice
white
the
statute
says,
if
you
abandon
the
child,
you
have
committed
a
misdemeanor.
then
it
says,
and
if
you
leave
the
state
after
having
abandoned
the
child,
you've
committed
another
misdemeanor.
period.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
there
were
two
misdemeanors.
justice
white
yes?
justice
white
but
a
valid
one.
justice
white
do
you
question
at
all
the
authority
state
to
criminalize
the
failure
to
support
a
child?
justice
white
even
though
it's
criminalizing
not
paying
a
debt,
in
a
sense?
in
order
to--
justice
white
--yes,
i
know,
but
no
part
of
your
case
questions
at
all
the
authority
of
the
state
to
criminalize?
justice
white
well,
what
about
the
initial
interest
of
the
state
in
keeping
the
fellow
within
reach
so
that
they
can
collect
child
support?
why
isn't
that
a
compelling
interest
in
itself?
justice
white
well,
the
right
to
travel--
justice
white
--all
right,
accepting
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
it
burdens
the
right
to
travel,
then
there
must
be
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
it,
and
what's
wrong
with
keeping
him
around
so
that
support
may
be
collected?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
why
isn't
that
a
compelling
interest?
