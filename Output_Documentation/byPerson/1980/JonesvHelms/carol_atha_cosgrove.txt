ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
today
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
a
state
in
furtherance
of
its
interests
in
protecting
its
children
and
enforcing
its
criminal
law
may
enact
a
statute
which
provides
that
a
person
who
commits
the
crime
of
child
abandonment
and
leaves
the
state
is
guilty
of
a
felony,
whereas
a
person
who
commits
the
crime
of
child
abandonment
without
leaving
the
state
is
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
appellee's
challenge--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--no,
sir,
there
is
no
time
element
specified
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
appellee's
challenge
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
predicated
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
distinguishes
between
two
classes
of
abandoning
parents,
based
upon
the
exercise
of
their
constitutional
right
to
travel,
and
that
therefore
the
statute
is
void
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
appellee
is
a
father
who
was
ordered
by
a
georgia
court
to
make
child
support
payments
but
who
never
did,
who
simply
went
to
alabama.
he
testified
that
he
did
not
go
to
alabama
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
his
child
support
obligations
but
rather
to
attend
school.
when
he
returned
to
georgia
to
visit
his
child
he
was
arrested
on
the
warrant
for
the
felony
of
abandoning
his
child
and
leaving
the
state,
and
received
a
three
year
sentence
suspended
on
condition
that
he
make
child
support
payments,
which
he
never
did.
instead
he
just
left
the
state
again.
he
eventually
became
a
resident
of
florida.
upon
his
wife's
death
he
regained
custody
of
his
child,
but
he
had
some
problems
with
the
florida
authorities
and
moved
back
to
augusta,
georgia,
where
the
child
had
to
be
placed
in
the
department
of
family
and
children
services
custody,
basically
a
welfare
agency.
and
thereafter,
the
appellee
was
arrested
on
an
outstanding
bench
warrant
and
sentenced
to
serve
three
years.
after
having
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
the
appellee
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
georgia
alleging
that
the
statute
violated
his
constitutional
right
to
travel
and
was
void
under
both
the
equal
protection
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
appellee
but
upon
appeal
to
the
5th
circuit
the
district
court's
order
was
reversed
and
judgment
entered
for
appellee.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
your
honor,
i
believe
the
5th
circuit
saw
our
statute
as
not
having
the
requisite
specific
intent
which
would
make
it
pass
muster.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
it
was
the
5th
circuit's
opinion
that
without
the
specific
intent
the
statute
would
be
overly
broad.
it's
our
contention,
of
course,
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
a
specific
intent
for
that
element
of
the
crime.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
that's
correct.
i
believe
only
in
the
first
amendment
area
has
there
been
a
chilling
and
an
overbreadth
problem
addressed
by
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
inasmuch
as
the
appellee
did
have
a
fundamental
right
to
travel,
that
the
statute
was
the
subject
of
strict
scrutiny;
and
secondly,
since
georgia
has
no
compelling
state
interest
involved,
that
the
statute
would
be
violative
of
equal
protection.
the
court
of
appeals
also
reasoned
that
the
statute
was
overly
broad
in
that
we
had
the
uniform
reciprocal
enforcement
of
support
act,
uresa,
which
was
available
to
vindicate
any
of
georgia's
interests.
appellant
appealed
that
decision
on
september
19,
1980,
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
january
26,
1981.
there
are
two
issues
before
the
court
today.
first,
whether
parents
who
commit
the
crime
of
child
abandonment
do
have
a
fundamental
right
to
travel
in
this
instance.
and
secondly,
if
such
a
right
does
exist,
whether
georgia's
child
abandonment
statute
impermissibly
penalizes
that
right
without
being
justified
by
compelling
state
interest.
now,
turning
to
the
first
issue,
it
is
georgia's
position
that
the
fundamental
right
to
travel,
to
migrate,
to
settle
in
other
states,
was
never
intended
to
encompass
and
protect
the
criminal's
right
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
his
own
misdeeds.
whatever
the
constitutional
rights
of
criminals
in
other
contexts
may
be,
their
rights
to
full
and
free
travel
are
attenuated.
for
example,
if
a
person
commits
a
crime,
just
leaves
the
jurisdiction,
even
without
intent
to
avoid
prosecution,
he
is
nevertheless
subject
to
mandatory
extradition
proceedings.
and
in
addition,
many
states
including
georgia
have
statutes
of
limitations
which
are
tolled
the
instant
a
person
leaves
the
state,
thus
dramatically
increasing
the
time
period
during
which
a
person
may
be
punished
for
a
crime.
so,
since
we
do
not
believe
that
there
are
any
fundamental
rights
involved
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
it
is
the
rational
basis
test
that
should
be
applied
to
this
statute
and
that
the
statute
easily
passes
that
test.
as
this
court
has
noted,
it
is
the
state
legislature
which
is
preeminently
responsible
for
defining,
and
punishing
crimes.
and
we
submit
that
the
state
legislature
could
rationally
have
decided
that
a
person
who
commits
a
crime,
in
this
instance
the
crime
of
child
abandonment
and
leaves
the
state
makes
it
much
more
difficult
for
the
state
to
bring
him
to
justice,
that
that
person
deserves
a
more
stringent
punishment.
however,
even
if
strict
scrutiny
test
were
to
be
applied,
as
appellee
urges,
we
submit
that
the
statute
would
also
pass
muster
under
this
more
exacting
standard,
for
it
is
not
every
constitutional
infringement,
of
course,
that
is
barred,
it's
only
those
which
rise
to
the
level
of
penalty.
it's
our
position,
of
course,
that
this
statute
in
no
way
penalizes
the
right
to
migrate.
indeed,
if
it
has
any
effect
at
all
upon
the
right
to
migrate
and
settle
in
other
states,
that
effect
is
purely
incidental
and
remote.
for
under
the
statute
a
parent
is
free
to
move
to
any
state
he
wishes,
stay
as
long
as
he
wishes,
and
the
statute
has
absolutely
no
impact
upon
him
at
all
unless
he
has
committed
the
crime
of
child
abandonment.
so
this
statute
is
unlike
provisions
which
this
court
has
struck
down
in,
for
example,
crandall
v.
nevada,
a
taxing
provision
that
reached
everyone
who
left
the
state.
this
statute
is
narrowly
tailored
to
reach
only
those
persons
who
have
committed
a
crime.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
there
is--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--on
the
face
of
the
statute
it
does,
your
honor.
however,
it's
our
position
that
the
appellee
really
would
have
no
standing
to
raise
that
second
prong--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--of
the
statute
since
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
he
pled
guilty.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
secondly,
i
might
mention
that,
unlike
some
of
the
cases,
for
example
maricopa
county
and
shapiro,
where
this
court
was
concerned
with
provisions
which
addressed
themselves
primarily
to
indigents,
that
this
statute
does
not
impact
on
those
persons
who
are
in
the
blameless
but
unfortunate
situation
of
poverty.
rather,
this
statute
impacts
on
the
most
blameworthy
persons,
those
parents
who
abandon
their
helpless
children.
so
we
feel
that
this
statute
no
more
penalizes
parents
who
simply
wish
to
go
to
another
state
than
does
the
existence
of
an
extradition
law
or
an
indefinite
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
well,
your
honor,
of
course
the
georgia
legislature
certainly
could
have
done
that
and
many
states
have,
but
i
think
that
in
not
doing
so
they
have
recognized
the
difference
in
the
type
of
crime,
in
that
the
impact
upon
the
child
is
greater
because
the
likelihood
of
ever
recovering
any
support
is
much
less
when
the
parent--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--well,
sir,
there
are
two
elements
in
child
abandonment.
first,
one
has
to
desert
the
child.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
for
not
supporting.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
even
if
the
court
were
to
see
this
as
somewhat
of
a
penalty
upon
the
constitutional
right
to
travel,
it's
georgia's
position
that
the
statute
is
more
than
justified
by
our
compelling
interest
in
protecting
our
children
and
enforcing
our
criminal
laws.
and
this
interest
in
protecting
our
children
appellee
does
not
even
dispute,
and
it
is
manifested
in
at
least
two
other
statutes
which
make
this
same
felony
misdemeanor
distinction.
for
example,
we
have
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
felony
for
a
husband
to
abandon
his
pregnant
wife
and
leave
the
state,
whereas
if
he
stays
in
the
state,
it
is
a
misdemeanor.
and
similarly,
we
have
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
felony
if
one
is
to
interfere
with
the
custody
of
a
child
who
is
committed
to
the
legal
custody
of
another,
and
then
to
take
that
child
out
of
the
state.
and
again,
interference
with
the
custody
of
a
child
within
the
state
is
only
a
misdemeanor.
so,
i
think
the
court
can
see
that
georgia
is
fairly
consistent
in
this
design
to
protect
its
children.
turning
to
the
interest
in
protecting
our
criminal
laws,
practically
speaking,
when
a
criminal
leaves
the
jurisdiction,
georgia,
just
like
every
other
state,
is
dependent
upon
extradition
to
get
that
person
back
to
face
trial
or
to
serve
his
punishment.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
not
to
my
understanding,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
there
are
many
statutes,
including
federal
statutes
that--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--yes,
sir,
i
think
it
could
be.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
i'm
not
at
all
sure,
your
honor.
the
felony
provision
of
georgia's
child
abandonment
statute
greatly
enhances
extradition
for...
although
i'm
sure
this
court
is
aware
that,
technically
speaking,
it
is
possible
to
extradite
for
misdemeanors
under
both
state
and
federal
law,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
extradite
for
misdemeanors
is
totally
within
the
governor
of
the
responding
state.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
perhaps
our
problems
with
extradition
would
disappear,
your
honor.
but
again,
i
would
say
that
the
georgia--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--yes,
sir.
the
appellee
would
not
contend
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
a
felony
across
the
board.
it's
simply
our
position
that
the
georgia
legislature
need
not
make
that
across
the
board
distinction.
as
i
was
saying,
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
extradite
for
misdemeanors
is
totally
within
the
purview
of
the
governor
of
the
responding
state.
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
georgia
really
does
not
even
need
to
use
extradition
to
satisfy
our
interest
in
this
case,
that
we
have
the
provision
of
uresa,
the
uniform
reciprocal
enforcement
of
support
act,
which
can
vindicate
any
of
our
interests,
mainly
that
we
can
obtain
support
for
the
child,
or
return
the
parent
to
the
state.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
this
regard
for
several
reasons.
i
need
to
explain
that
all
50
states
have
in
fact
adopted
some
sort
of
reciprocal
enforcement
act.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
a
less
drastic
means,
argument
which
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
court
of
appeals
used
as
an
example
of
the
overbreadth
that
we
did
have
this
alternative
means
available
to
us,
and
i
think,
quite
honestly,
that
this
alternative
means
simply
is
not
effective
for
under
the
version
of
uresa
which
has
been
adopted
by
approximately
10
states,
there
is
a
provision
by
which
an
absent
parent
can
totally
avoid
extradition.
he
simply
submits
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
the
responding
state
and
agrees
to
pay
some
child
support.
and
he
never
comes
back
to
georgia,
he
never
sees
the
inside
of
a
jail.
for
the
remaining
states
which
do
not
have
that
automatic
avoidance
of
extradition,
many
of
them
nevertheless
have
a
discretionary
section
which
says
to
the
governor
of
the
responding
state,
basically,
if
there
has
not
been
a
uresa
petition
filed,
you
don't
have
to
extradite
this
person.
you
can
require
a
uresa
petition
to
be
filed
first.
and
secondly,
if
there
is
an
outstanding
order
of
some
type
in
existence
and
the
absent
parent
is
complying
with
that
order,
then
the
governor
can
also
just
refuse
to
extradite
that
person.
i
think
if
we
were
to
follow
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
we
could
conceivably
have
a
situation
where
a
person
abandons
his
child
in
georgia,
goes
to
another
jurisdiction,
and
even
if
the
custodial
parent...
and
i
might
add,
it
is
usually
the
custodial
parent
which
files
a
uresa
petition...
even
if
that
custodial
parent
were
successful
in
getting
that
absent
parent
into
the
court
of
the
responding
state,
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
he
could
totally
avoid
extradition
by
simply
agreeing
to
pay
child
support.
and
the
difficulty
with
that...
you
know,
one
might
say,
well,
he's
paying
child
support,
that
ought
to
settle
the
problem...
the
difficulty
is
that
the
duty
of
support
which
uresa
contemplates
is
not
the
duty
of
support
which
obtains
in
the
demanding
state,
in
georgia,
for
example.
it
would
be
the
duty
of
support
imposable
under
the
laws
where
the
absent
parent
was,
and
that's
presumed
to
be
the
responding
state.
so
we
can
have
a
situation
where
the
absent
parent
comes
into
court,
he
agrees
to
pay
child
support,
he
may
well
be
a
respected
member
of
the
community
by
now,
and
the
court
simply
will
not
impose
a
large
amount
of
support
on
that
absent
parent,
and
thus
really
defeating
the
order
of
the
georgia
court,
and
also
not
meeting
the
needs
of
the
child.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
we
could
simply
use
this
civil
statute
as
a
substitute
for
our
criminal
statute.
it
is
our
position,
of
course,
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
define
and
punish
anti
social
conduct
such
as
child
abandonment
and
that
we
have
a
right,
if
the
need
be,
to
put
this
person
in
jail
or
at
least
to
make
him
think
that
he
is
going
to.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
well,
sir,
they're
dual
interests.
of
course
we
want
support
for
the
child.
i
think
the
problem
with
the
uresa
petition
is--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--well,
it's
the
whole
purpose
if
the
person
complies
with
court
orders.
but
as
your
honor
is
probably
aware,
a
person
can
say,
of
course
i'm
going
to
comply.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
not
in
that
particular
instance.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
no,
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
child
abandonment
because
he--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--well,
there
are
two
prongs,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
you
have
to
abandon
your
child,
desert
your
parental
duties,
and
then
leave
the
child
in
a
dependent
condition.
so
if
he
were
complying
with
a
court
order
regardless
of
how--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--i
think
he
would
still
be
susceptible
to
this
charge,
your
honor,
because
he
needs
to
follow--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--well,
sometimes,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
well,
your
honor,
sometimes
it's
called
a
typical
drifting
absentee
father
who
comes
into
one
court
and
says,
of
course,
i'll
pay,
and
he
pays
for
a
few
months
and
then
goes
on.
and
i
think--
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
--it's
very
difficult,
your
honor,
it
really
is,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
crucial
reasons
that
georgia
needs
this
felony
provision
of
the
child
abandonment
statute,
simply
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
this
type
of
person
back
if
need
be.
i
think
if
we
were
to
follow
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
regard,
our
right
to
define
and
punish
antisocial
conduct
such
as
child
abandonment
would
be
defeated
because
our
right
to
enforce
our
laws
is
simply
meaningless
without
an
effective
method
of
bringing
the
criminal
back
to
trial.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
your
honor,
this
can
either
be
by
the
recommendation
of
the
jury
and
then
has
to
be
approved
by
the
judge,
or
the
judge
on
his
own
motion
can
reduce
the
felony.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
not
to
my
understanding.
and
that
provision,
i
might
note,
is
not
unique
just
to
child
abandonment,
it
applies
to
everything
but
capital
felonies.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
basically,
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge,
your
honor,
because
the
jury
can
recommend
it
but
the
judge
has
to
approve.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
that's
correct.
in
sum,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
georgia
child
abandonment
statute,
particularly
the
felony
division,
is
absolutely
crucial
to
the
enforcement
of
georgia's
interests
in
protecting
her
children
and
in
enforcing
her
criminal
laws.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
was
clearly
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
ms.
carol
atha
cosgrove
i
don't
have
anything
further.
