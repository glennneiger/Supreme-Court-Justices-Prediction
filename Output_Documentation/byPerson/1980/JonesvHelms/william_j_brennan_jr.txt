justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
ms.
cosgrove,
if
we
agree
with
the
argument
to
this
point
with
you,
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
question,
do
we?
justice
jr.
if
we
agree
with
what
you
have
said
up
to
date,
supporting
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
not
violative
of
the
right
to
travel,
then
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
alternative?
justice
jr.
but
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
it
if
we
agree
with
your
initial
argument.
