justice
marshall
are
you
interested
in
support
for
the
child
or
putting
him
in
jail?
justice
marshall
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
purpose.
justice
marshall
well,
i
understand
you
that
if
somebody
goes
to
another
state
and
sends
the
money
back,
would
you
still
bring
him
back?
justice
marshall
if
a
man
is
giving
$25
a
month
support
and
he
goes
to
alabama
and
he
sends
back
$25
a
month,
you
still
would
make
him
come
back
and
go
to
jail?
justice
marshall
no,
i'm
telling
you,
he
says
he
has
abandoned
the
child.
justice
marshall
yes,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
marshall
he
violated
a
support
order
and
he
went
away
and
he
changed
his
mind
and
sent
the
money
back
but
he
didn't
come
back.
would
you
still
want
him?
justice
marshall
he
needs
to
be
taught
a
lesson?
justice
marshall
it's
sometimes
called
a
pound
of
flesh.
justice
marshall
you
don't
ever
catch
them.
justice
marshall
how
does
this
affect
his
right
to
travel?
he
could
go
to
russia.
justice
marshall
but
if
he
took
care
of
those
children.
isn't
that
right?
justice
marshall
and
he
wouldn't
violate
any
statute
of
georgia?
justice
marshall
so
how
does
this
case
involve
the
right
to
travel?
justice
marshall
come
on.
there's
no
connection.
justice
marshall
but
it
doesn't
affect
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
man
traveled
twice.
justice
marshall
so,
he
didn't...
the
first
one
didn't
even
bother
him.
justice
marshall
didn't
he
travel
twice?
justice
marshall
do
i
assume
that
he
traveled
twice?
justice
marshall
yes,
he
was
a
traveling
man.
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
involve
my
right
to
travel
because
i
haven't
abandoned
any
children.
justice
marshall
but
i'm
not.
justice
marshall
it
is
because
he's
poor?
justice
marshall
do
you
think
a
poor
man
would
be
traveling
twice?
justice
marshall
yes,
he's
poor.
justice
marshall
did
he
borrow
the
money
or
something?
justice
marshall
could
he
have
used
that
money
he
used
to
travel
to
pay
for
his
children?
justice
marshall
well,
if
my
opinion
said
what
you
think
it
says,
why
in
the
world
do
you
think
i'm
asking
these
questions?
justice
marshall
you
agree
that
the
jury
could
have
made
it
a
misdemeanor?
justice
marshall
oh,
i
see,
you
agree
to
that?
they
could
have
done
that?
justice
marshall
but
they
could
have
done
that
in
your
case?
