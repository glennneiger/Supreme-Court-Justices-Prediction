warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
jones
v.
helms.
ms.
cosgrove,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
does
it
make
any
difference
under
this
statute
whether
the
particular
person
left
the
state
three
hours
after
the
commission
of
the
act
or
three
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bonner.
chief
justice
burger
let's
alter
that
a
little
bit.
instead
of
what
you've
suggested,
that
if
he
flees
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
prosecution,
the
penalty
will
be
doubled?
chief
justice
burger
i
thought
you
had
previously
conceded
that
if
he'd
committed
any
crime
and
then
left
the
state
to
avoid
prosecution,
they
could
double
the
penalty?
chief
justice
burger
not
the
precise
statute,
but
you
tell
me
what's
the
distinction?
chief
justice
burger
to
avoid
prosecution.
chief
justice
burger
yes,
but
the
reason
they
may
not
have
been
prosecuted
is
that
they
left
the
state
and
couldn't
be
reached.
chief
justice
burger
this
is
true
of
a
person
under
indictment
who
flees
the
state.
he
carries
the
presumption
of
innocence
right
with
him
across
the
state
border.
chief
justice
burger
why
are
they
more
reasonable
or
less
reasonable
than
with
the
misdemeanor
that
justice
stevens
postulated
to
you?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
other
hand--
chief
justice
burger
--are
you
suggesting
the
state
couldn't
adopt
a
felony
statute
that
they
couldn't
leave
the
state
if
they
left
dependent
minor
children
behind
them?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what's
the
statute
except
that?
that's
what
this
statute
is,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
yes,
but
you
say
they
can't--
chief
justice
burger
--that's
your
reason
for
saying
it's
bad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
