mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
get
one
thing
straight,
i
guess,
at
the
outset,
and
that
is
that
we
don't
necessarily
contest
the
opening
principle,
i
think,
that
the
state
started
its
argument
with,
that
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
right
to
travel
which
protects
a
parent
or
an
accused
from
the
consequences
of
his
misdeeds.
that's
not
our
argument
at
all,
and
that's
a
mischaracterization
of
it.
i
will
concede
at
the
outset
that
there
is
probably,
in
fact
there
is
certainly
a
valid
area
here,
a
general
area
here
of
application
of
the
state's
police
power.
the
state
can
reach
fugitive
parents,
it
can
proscribe
that
conduct,
it
can
reach
parents
who
use
their
right
to
travel
across
a
state
line
to
frustrate
the
state's
interest,
to
compound
an
offense.
but
this
isn't
that
kind
of
statute,
and
the
existence
of
a
valid
area
for
operation
of
that
kind
of
statute
don't
save
this
one.
we
need
to
look
at
the...
if
this
were
that
kind
of
statute,
then
what
she
said
about
there
being
a
reasonable
connection
and
this
being
subject
to
the
rational
connection
test
would
probably
be
valid.
but
this
is
not
such
a
statute.
the
question
before
this
court
as
a
preliminary
matter
is
how
this
statute
by
its
terms,
on
its
face,
affects
travel.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
not
completely,
your
honor.
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
morissette
necessarily
has
any
basis
here,
but
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question
if
you
can
let
me
get
my
next
thought
out.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
revive
it.
as
i
say,
our
question
here
is
how
this
statute
affects
the
right
of
travel.
and
if
you
look
at
it,
any
travel
triggers
the
statute.
the
reason...
as
the
state
has
conceded,
the
reason
for
the
travel
is
totally
insignificant.
the
time
of
the
travel
is
totally
insignificant.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
man
is
accused
before
he
crosses
the
state
lines
or
whether
he
becomes
accused
subsequently,
although
for
that
subsequent
class,
obviously,
you
have
that
privileges
and
immunities
problem,
which
we
don't
have
any
standing
to
raise.
but
it's
important
to
look
at
that
aspect
of
the
statute
because
it
shows
what
the
statute
does.
this
isn't
a
fugitive
statute.
bobby
helms
could
have
crossed
the
state
line
to
visit
his
sick
mother
in
alabama
and
as
long
as
he
was
subject
to
being
charged
before
or
after
with
child
abandonment,
he
would
fall
under
this
special
felony
jeopardy.
there
is
not
even
any
requirement
in
this--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--well,
quite
a
bit
is
the
matter
with
that,
your
honor,
because
the
right
to
travel
is
a
constitutionally
secured
right.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct,
but
that
person
is
accused,
the
restriction
on
his
right
to
travel,
for
example,
could
be
relieved
by
a
court,
it
could
be
relieved...
there
are
adjustments.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
this,
again,
is
not
a
statute
which
applies
to
someone
who
stands
accused.
bobby
helms
when
he
left
the
state
was
not
accused.
at
least...
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that,
but
he
certainly
wasn't
arrested
and
he
certainly
didn't
know
he
was
accused
until
he
came
back
and
was
arrested.
yes,
but
the
crime
isn't
committed
unless
he's
already
abandoned
the
child.
well,
no,
sir,
it
can
be
committed
subsequently.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
in
effect,
what
you
are
doing
is
inferring
or
raising,
the
statute
i
should
say
is
doing,
is
making
a
presumption,
erecting
a
presumption
that
any
parent
who
leaves
the
state
for
any
reason
without
even
any
nexus
to
the
offense
of
abandonment--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--no,
sir,
there
would
be
no
equal
protection
problem
there.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
it
would
be
the
same
difference.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
you're
talking
about
a
flight
type
of
thing.
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
but
obviously
you
couldn't
have
that
kind
of
statute
without
some
intent
element,
you
couldn't...
georgia
could
not
say
who--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--well,
you've
got
to
at
least
have
some
connection.
intent
is
one
way
of
connecting
the
exercise--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--actually...
actually,
your
honor,
the
statute
said,
a
misdemeanor
to
abandon
your
child,
and/if
the
parent
leaves
the
state
it's
a
felony.
so
it's
not--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--well,
no,
i
don't
believe
we
would.
obviously,
if
you
had
a
separate
statute
dealing
with
flight
to
avoid
prosecution--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--that's
an
encumbrance
on
the
right
to
travel,
and
admittedly.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
a
valid
one.
and
there
are
valid
ones.
and
there
are
invalid
ones.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no,
sir,
no.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
intent
is
one
way
to
confine
the
intrusion
on
the
right
to
travel.
purpose
would
be
another
way.
some
sort
of
nexus...
i
believe
that
arkansas
statute
or
the
rhode
island
statute
that
says
he
commits
the
offense
by
leaving
the
state.
but
here
what
you've
got
is
the
exercise
of
a
constitutionally
secured
right
which
for
any
reason,
for
any
purpose,
and,
frankly,
any
time,
triggers
the
special
felony
jeopardy.
it
is
like...
i
don't
think
you'd
have
any
trouble
with
a
state
statute
here
which
said,
burglary
is
a
felony
carrying
a
ten
year
sentence
but
if
the
defendant
doesn't
confess,
it
carries
20
years.
obviously,
that's
an
extreme
example,
but
what
you've
got
here--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--no
problem
whatsoever,
your
honor.
none
whatsoever.
i
don't
think,
frankly,
that
there
would
be
any
problem
if
you
had
a
rhode
island-type
statute
where
it
says,
commits
child
abandonment
by
leaving
the
state.
but
the
problem
here
is
that
you've
just
simply
got
an
exercise
of
the
right
to
travel
which
triggers
it,
and
it's
triggered
even
before
the
defendant--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--well,
now,
it
might
not--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
same
way
aptheker
did.
mr.
aptheker
could
have
traveled
anywhere
too.
all
he
would
have
had
to
do
is
renounce
his
associations.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
let
me
back
up,
too,
because
you've
got
to,
you've
raised
what
is
really
the
next
issue,
whose
right
to
travel
is
affected
here?
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--you're
assuming--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--you're
assuming
a
couple
things.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
oh,
he
traveled
abundantly.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
even
more
when
he
was
in
the
army.
but
the
question
is,
whose
right
to
travel
is
affected
here?
where
you've
got
this
kind
of
broad
intrusion
on
a
constitutionally
secured
right,
it's
everyone's
right
to
travel,
or
at
least
every
parent
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
if
you
were
a
poor
mill
worker
in
griffin,
georgia--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--no,
but
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
who's...
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question
of
whose
right
to
travel
it
affects.
where
you're
living
on
a
marginal
income,
you
separate,
there's
a
real
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
adequate
support
being
given.
that
particular
person's
right
to
travel
is
chilled
by
this
statute.
he's
under
a
special
jeopardy.
he
may
want
to
visit--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--that's
true.
the
poor
are
particularly--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--poor
and
he
traveled
twice.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
this
is
exactly
the
situation--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
what,
your
honor?
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
he
didn't
go
far.
it
was
a
greyhound
bus
ticket.
i
suppose
he
could
have.
but
this
is
comparable
to
the
situation
you
had
in
zablocki,
with
its
broad
intrusion
upon
the
right
to
marry.
this
court
didn't
stop
to
look
into
the
depth
of
this
fellow's
pocketbook
or
into
the
justifications
he
had.
your
own
opinion,
justice
marshall,
went
ahead
and
talked
about
the
people
who
dwelt
on
the
margin,
whose
rights
to
travel
were
chilled...
i
mean,
whose
rights--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--i
don't
know.
i
was--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i
don't
see
any
problem
whatsoever
with
that.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
not
necessarily.
this
is
echoing
what
justice
rehnquist
asked.
not
necessarily
on
the
absence
of
intent;
on
the
promiscuous
use
this
statute
makes
of
the
right
to
travel,
the
fact
that
it
is--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--no
intent,
no
purpose,
no
connection
with
the
offense.
in
pure
happenstance.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
stewart?
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
and
it
would
not
analytically
be
different
from
this
case.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
it
exactly.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
what
we've
got
here.
of
course,
every
parent
is
subject,
theoretically--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--because
he
exercised
a
right
the
constitution
gave
him.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
it
happened.
but
you
see,
they
had
to
drag
him
back
and
establish
his
guilt
of
that
offense.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
if
he
had
run
from
phenix
city
down
to
tybee
light
and
hidden
out
in
the
dunes
down
there,
he'd
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
that's
not
this
kind
of
statute.
let
me...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
maybe,
if
i
did
say
that,
i
somewhat
misunderstood
the
hypothetical
thrown
at
me.
i
think,
even
in
that
situation,
you
would
have
to
have
some
nexus
between
leaving
the
state
and
intent
or
purpose--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--no
problem.
that's
a
nexus
that's
sufficient,
there,
again.
this
isn't
that
kind
of
statute.
this
says
nothing
about
why
he
leaves
the
state.
if
it
did,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
would
not
get
by
the
rational
connection
test
here.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
a
much
tougher
question,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
one
thing
that
makes
it
different
is...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
maybe
that's
a
welcome
question
for
me.
in
that
particular
case
you've
got
somebody
whose
liberty
interests
have
been
circumscribed
because
he's
been
convicted.
and
that's
the
difference
between
bobby
helms
and
your
hypothetical.
you've
got...
our
situation,
this
particular
statute,
has
an
impact
upon
parents
who,
at
the
very
least,
are
presumptively
innocent
of
abandonment,
who
may
not
even
have
been
charged
with
abandonment.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
oh,
well,
your
honor,
i
think
later
the
problem
of
their
being
reached
is
going
to
dissipate.
that's
not
necessarily
so.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
you're
asking
me
whether
you
can
have
strict
liability
offenses,
you
certainly
can.
but
you
can't
when
you
are
triggering
that
offense
on
a
constitutionally
secured
right.
i
suppose
here
you're
vaguely
talking
about
a
right
to
free
speech
or
something
like
that,
but
i
don't
think
that's
really
quite
comparable.
i
don't
see
any
problem.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
you're
going
to
have
an
easy
time
finding
some
which
turn
on
constitutionally
secured
right
without
this
court
primarily
coming
in
and
saying
that
when
you've
got
it
turning
on
a
constitutionally
secured
right,
you've
got
it...
have
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
that's
got
to
be
carefully
tailored
to
address
the
specific
governmental
interest.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no
problem
at
all.
the
state
can
make
that
judgment--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--no
case
at
all.
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
right.
in
effect,
georgia
has
made
a
judgment
that
for
the
same
offense
people
who
would
happen
to
exercise
their
rights
to
travel
are
guilty
of
a
greater
offense,
regardless
of
whether
they
in
fact
are,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
in
fact
trying
to
flee
the
jurisdiction
and
not
visit
their
sick
grandmother
or
to
seek
educational
benefits
in
alabama.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
let
me
run
that
by.
i
think
that
would...
yeah,
i
suppose
georgia
probably
could.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
our
problem
here
with
this
particular
statute
is
its
impact
upon
a
broad
group
of
people.
i
think
if
you've
got,
if
you
had
a
statute
that's
saying
one
who
is
charged
with
anything
may
not
leave
the
state,
that
would
be
perfectly
valid,
and
that's
sort
of
what
i
understood
your
question
to
say.
but
here
we--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--okay,
i'll
back
up.
no,
georgia
couldn't.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
but
there
you've
got...
one
who
escapes
from
prison
knows
he
escaped
from
prison.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
there's
a
great
difference
there.
but
the
other
thing
is
that
at
least
you've
got
a--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--in
your
hypothetical,
you've
got
a
carefully
circumscribed
group
on
which
the
statute
impacts,
and
we
don't
have
that
here.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
here
you've
got--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--you've
got
parents.
any
parent
who's
presumptively
innocent,
who
hasn't
been
convicted,
is
subject
to
jeopardy
under
this
particular
statute.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
and
the
restrictions
on
him
are
reasonable,
but
what
you've
got--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--well,
because
that's
a
reasonable
intrusion
onto
the
right
to
travel,
vis
a
vis
the
state's
interest
in
having
him
there
and
prosecuting
him.
i
don't
really
see
any
analogy
there.
but
this,
again,
is
the
same
situation
as
if
georgia
had
isolated,
say,
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
made
that
there
a
special
penalty
of
death,
as
in
jackson
v.
united
states;
or
attaching
a
poll
tax
to
voting
in
a
federal
election,
as
in
harman
v.
forssenius.
this
is
what
georgia
has
done,
and
the
reason
that
this
case
falls
in
the
shadow
of
those
authorities
is
again
basically
because
of
the
wanton
use
georgia
makes
of
interstate
travel
as
an
element
of
this
offense.
wanton,
because
it
has
no
nexus,
has
no
intent,
is
not
confined
by
any
kind
of
purpose,
need
not
have
any
relationship
at
all
under
that
statute
to
the
state's
interest.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no,
sir,
none
at
all.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
i
have
no
qualms
about
that.
i'm
here
because
my
client's
been
branded
a
felon
and
not
a
misdemeanant.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
policy
reasons
why
not,
and
i
think
that's
why
you've
got
uresa,
because
of
the
judgments
that
the
state
made
that
this
kind
of
problem
is
better
approached
civilly.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
just
entirely
discretionary.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they,
could
have
done
it.
but
it
would
be
a
judgment
that
would
be
made
without
any
guidance,
without
any--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
they
certainly
could.
let
me
jump
ahead
to
the
strict
scrutiny
analysis
which
i
hope
we
reach
somewhere.
but
if
you
figure
that
we've
got
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel
here,
then
under
the
familiar
formulas
of
this
court,
it
would
fall
strict
scrutiny,
and
i
don't
mean
to
repeat
it
for
your
edification,
but
for
mine,
that
would
mean
that
the
state
would
have
to
show
that
it's
reasonably
necessary
to
promote
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
state
basically,
their
interest
here
comes
down
to
extradition.
when
you
look
behind
everything
they
can
say
about
the
welfare
of
the
child
and
about
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law,
on
both
avenues
it
boils
down
to
aiding
extradition.
but
the
only...
the
thing
is
that
that's
not
necessarily
compelling
interest
because
we've
got
the
extradition
clause
of
the
constitution,
we've
got
the
federal
extradition
act,
we've
got
uresa,
we've
got
uniform
reciprocal...
whatever
it
is...
uniform
criminal
extradition
act.
all
of
these
serve,
they
completely
serve
that
interest.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
last
two,
bobby
helms
need
not
ever
have
even
been
in
georgia,
much
less
have
been
a
fugitive
from
georgia.
under
all
law,
the
caliber
of
the
crime,
the
fact
that
it's
a
misdemeanor,
not
a
felony,
doesn't
prevent
extradition.
he's
extraditable
under
all
of
them.
elevating
it
to
a
felony
doesn't
apparently
aid
the
state's
interest
one
bit
except
for
the
argument
they
make
that
governors
will
treat
this
offense
more
seriously
and
everything
if
it's
a
felony,
which
is
a
pretty
good
argument
if
you
want
to
make
the
whole
crime
a
felony,
but
it's
not
a
pretty
good
argument
for
the
distinction.
the
state
fails
on
the
necessity
aspect
of
that
strict
scrutiny
test.
looking
at
it
simply
under
uresa
and
everything
else,
it's
just
not
necessary,
and
it
can't
promote
it.
even
if
it
were
a
felony
and
the
state
proceeded
under
uresa,
they
would
still
encounter
those
relief
provisions
that
the
state
talked
about.
a
judge
in
alabama
could
still...
or,
a
judge
in
another
state,
by
entertaining
an
action
brought
by
the
father
over
there,
could
completely
bar
extradition
under
uresa,
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
felony
or
misdemeanor.
but
in
any
event
uresa
is
designed
to
be
a
supplementary
kind
of
extradition
procedure,
not
one
that
necessarily
preempts.
i
forget
exactly
what
section
of
uresa
it
is,
but
the
state's
perfectly
free
to
proceed
under
all
its
other
extradition
powers.
and
again,
under
all
of
those
extradition
powers
whether
the
thing's
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor,
they
still
run
into
the
governor's
discretion.
and
making
it
a
capital
felony
is
not
necessarily
going
to
elude
that
governor's
discretion.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
well,
because
in
effect
it
attaches
a
special
penalty
to
any
parent's
right
to
travel--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--whether
he's
going
to
come
back,
whether
he's
not
going
to
come
back.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
oh,
maybe
i
should
back
up.
nothing
would
be
wrong
with
that.
that
would
be--
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
--well,
that
might
be
how
the
chief
justice's
question
a
minute
ago
makes
sense
about
one
under
indictment
can't
leave
the
state.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sure
if
anyone's
not
making
sense
that
it
comes
from
here,
not
from
there.
no,
i
mean,
that's
how
his
example
is
explicable,
because,
you
know,
that
kind
of
restriction
would
completely
and
carefully
serve
that
particular
interest.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
no,
it
couldn't.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
couldn't...
you
can
carry
it
somewhat
further,
and
say,
any
parent
who
wants
to
leave
the
state's
got
to
stop
at
the
state
border
and
post
bond
for
the
support
of
his
children.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
and
then
you'll
have
alabama
on
the
other
side
saying,
if
he
brings
his
children
in,
he's
got
to
post
bond
to
make
sure
they
don't
become
public
charges.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
state
could.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
that's
exactly
why
the
statute
is
wrong.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
is
bad.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
georgia
couldn't
do
that.
this
is
a
different
degree
of
intrusion,
but
it's
exactly
the
same
kind
of
pattern
of
intrusion.
here,
essentially,
georgia
has
taken
a
constitutionally
secured
right,
the
right
to
travel,
and
they've
made
the
degree
of
an
offense
turn
upon
it.
they'
made
the
difference
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor
turn
upon
it,
and
they've
made
it
turn
upon
it.
bobby
helms
couldn't
come
into
court
and
say
my
sick
grandmother
was
over
there
and
i
had
to
visit
her.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
bonner,
jr.
exactly.
i
think
while
it's
silent
i'll
sit
down.
