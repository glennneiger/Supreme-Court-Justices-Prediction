justice
rehnquist
ms.
cosgrove,
i
have
some
difficulty
interpreting
the
5th
circuit's
opinion,
perhaps
because
of
its
shortness.
it
seems
to
rely
at
some
length
on
the
morissette
case
from
this
court,
which
was
simply
as
i
had
understood
it
a
handbook
of
how
this
court
would
interpret
federal
statutes
with
respect
to
intent
and
was
not
a
constitutional
doctrine
at
all.
what
would
you
say
was
the
rationale
of
the
5th
circuit,
if
there
is
one?
justice
rehnquist
but
why
would
it
have
to
have
requisite...
why
does
it
have
to
have
any
specific
intent?
justice
rehnquist
well,
unless
you're
talking
about
free
speech
you
don't
have
an
overbreadth
challenge
here,
do
you?
justice
rehnquist
it
could
be
a
breach
of
a
bail
condition,
i
suppose.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
the
question
before
the
court,
before
you
get
to
that,
is,
what
does
the
5th
circuit's
opinion
mean?
do
you
understand
why
they
cited
morissette?
justice
rehnquist
by
all
means.
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
someone
who
is
subject
to
not
leaving
the
state
under
conditions
of
bail
can't
exercise
his
right
to
travel
to
visit
his
sick
mother
in
alabama.
justice
rehnquist
there
are
all
sorts
of
restrictions
on
right
to
travel.
justice
rehnquist
why
would
you
have
to
have
an
intent
element?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
insist
that
there
be
an
intent
requirement?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
georgia
could
enact
a
"blue
sky"
law
making
it
a
criminal
offense
to
misrepresent
something
in
a
prospectus
about
a
security
and
completely
omit
any
requirement
that
the
misrepresentation
be
intentional?
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
crimes
that
have
emerged
in
the
past
50
years
that
don't
require
any
intent
at
all.
