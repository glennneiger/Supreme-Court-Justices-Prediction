of
course,
this
whole
problem
could
be
solved,
i
suppose,
if
the
georgia
legislature
simply
made
child
abandonment
a
felony.
justice
stewart
this
is
not
a
support
statute;
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
justice
stewart
yes,
but
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
requires
the
parent
to
support.
it
only
punishes
the
parent
for
not
supporting.
justice
stewart
well,
again,
this
is
a
criminal
statute
we're
dealing
with
here.
and
the
law
that
you're
discussing
and
that
was
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
a
criminal
statute,
is
it?
it's
a
statute
to
enforce
the
duty
of
support
by
making
the
parents
supporters
of
the
child?
justice
stewart
that's
right.
he's
not
guilty
of
this
offense.
justice
stewart
now,
ms.
cosgrove,
this
statute
says
that
the
felony
shall
be
reducible
to
a
misdemeanor.
how,
under
georgia
practice,
is
it
reduced?
justice
stewart
the
prosecutor
can't
do
it?
prosecutor
can't
do
it?
justice
stewart
shall
be
reducible
to
a
misdemeanor.
and
that's
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury
or
the
judge?
justice
stewart
has
to
do
it.
justice
stewart
it
would
be
just
as
though
a
state
should
make
it
criminal
offense
to
travel?
justice
stewart
well,
if
a
state
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
anybody
to
leave
georgia,
that
would
be
an
extreme
example
of
what
you
find
invalid
about
this
case?
justice
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
stewart
but
the
reason
this
is
a
felony,
not
a
misdemeanor,
is
because
your
client
left
the
state
of
georgia.
justice
stewart
you'd
have
no
case
at
all,
mr.
bonner,
would
you,
if
people
who
abandon
their
children
and
didn't
leave
the
state
were
also
guilty
of
felonies?
justice
stewart
you'd
have
no
case
at
all?
justice
stewart
so
your
case
depends
upon
the
fact
that
other
people
are
treated
more
leniently?
justice
stewart
although
georgia,
surely
georgia
could
not
make
it
a
criminal
offense
for
any
georgia
parent
to
leave
the
state?
