justice
jr.
had
he
been
a
jehovah's
witness
when
he
was
first
employed?
justice
jr.
you
mean
that's
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
facts?
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
facts?
justice
jr.
that
this
being
a
free
exercise
claim--
justice
jr.
--we
independently
can
make
our
own
determination
of
what
the
facts
are?
justice
jr.
you're
saying
we
may
look
at
the
record
and
make
our
determination.
justice
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you,
i
take
it
we
can
read...
this
is
a
constitutional
fact
type
case,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
directly.
i
gather
we're
as
free
to
read
the
record
in
respect
to
this
constitutional
issue
as
was
the
indiana
supreme
court,
are
we
not?
justice
jr.
well,
that
isn't
my
question.
justice
jr.
my
question
is
whether
we
are
as
free
as
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
since
this
is
a
constitutional
fact
question,
to
read
the
record
and
reach
our
own
determination?
justice
jr.
where
did
you
get
that?
no,
no.
in
such
cases
as
the
involuntary
confession
cases...
didn't
set
up
any
clearly
erroneous
threshold
but
said
that
this
court
was
as
free
as
were
the
state
courts
to...
in
fact,
had
a
duty,
independently,
to
assess
the
record,
the
evidence
of
record.
