justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
extent
that
you
are
quoting
from
the
record
or
saying
that
the
record
shows,
i
take
it
the
final
guide
for
us
is
what
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
says
insofar
as
it
speaks
to
the
question,
as
to
what
the
facts
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean,
if
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
says
the
facts
were
different
than
that,
we
take
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
do
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
possible
to
affirm
a
lower
tribunal
on
a
different
ground,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
the
selective
service
cases
that
were
decided
in
the
late
60s
and
early
70s
where
it
was
held
that
an
ethical
or
sincerely
held
moral
belief,
even
though
nonreligiously
founded,
was
adequate
for
conscientious
objection.
what
if
his
views
stemmed
from
that
rather
than
from
his
membership
in
jehovah's
witnesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
cases
of
ours
would
you
say
they
would
be
guided
by?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
they
set
up
the
test
of
the
so-called
undisputed
facts,
that
if
there
had
been
a
resolution
of
disputed
fact
by
the
state,
you
accept
the
resolution
by
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
de
la
torre,
what
if
at
the
time
that
your
mr.
thomas
applied
for
work
at
the
foundry
he
was
told
that
as
a
matter
of
company
policy
someone
who
is
in
the
roll
mill
automatically
at
the
end
of
six
months
would
be
placed,
rotated
to
the
tank
production
department?
