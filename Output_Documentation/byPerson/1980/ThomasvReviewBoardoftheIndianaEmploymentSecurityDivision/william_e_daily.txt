mr.
william
e.
daily
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
answer
is
that
the
contributions
are
made
solely
by
the
employers
to
the
fund.
there
are
no
general
tax
funds,
although
i
would
suppose
that
the
employer
views
it
as
a
tax
on
the
employer
to
create
the
fund
in
the
first
place.
before
i
get
to
the
meat
of
my
argument,
i
have
to
address
a
point
raised
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
also
addressed
in
oral
argument
today.
i
do
not
believe
the
review
board
has
ever
conceded
that
there
is
not
a
compelling
state
interest.
there
is
some
ambiguous
language
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
of
appeals
which
seems
to
say
that
at
oral
argument
there
may
have
been
a
concession
by
the
state
on
a
compelling
state
interest
issue
but
the
review
board's
position
is
only
that.
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record
as
to
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
the
reason
for
that
blank
record
is
that
the
review
board
was
not
a
party
at
the
hearing
stage.
the
review
board
has
never
had
any
opportunity
to
present
facts
into
evidence
on
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
a
compelling
state
interest.
when
i
think
of
that,
i
think
i
will
show
as
i
go
through
my
argument
that
compelling
state
interest
is
not
really
relevant
to
this
case
and
the
case
can
be
decided
without
addressing
that
issue.
but
if
you
do
want
to
address
that
issue,
the
review
board
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
present
facts
if
the
case
should
be
remanded.
mr.
william
e.
daily
the
employer--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--and
the
employee.
mr.
william
e.
daily
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
some
lower
court.
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
can
hold
factual
hearings
in
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i
certainly
hope
it
doesn't
come
to
that
stage.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i'm
suggesting
that
the
review
board
certainly
should
have
an
opportunity
to
present
facts
as
to
the
existence
of
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i
think
perhaps
they
would
have
to
go
back...
if
the
decision
were
against
us
to
the
point
where
we
were
required
to
have
a
hearing
on
a
compelling
state
interest,
we
would
have
to
look
to
sherbert,
perhaps
wisconsin
v.
yoder,
and
that
line
of
cases.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i'm
sorry;
i
stated
the
wrong
case.
mr.
william
e.
daily
no.
yoder
will
not
help
in
compelling
state
interest.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
sherbert--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--sherbert
v.
verner;
right.
mr.
william
e.
daily
no,
i
think
we
would
have
to
be
guided
by
that
if
we
went
back
for
a
hearing
on
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i
think
it
should
be
modified,
i
think
there
are
some
very
good
points
in
sherbert
but
i
think
it
goes
too
far.
i'm
not
sure
that
sherbert
by
itself
goes
too
far,
but
it's
certainly
been
interpreted
by
subsequent
courts
and
by
some
decisions
from
this
court
more
broadly
than
the
decision
itself
warrants.
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
relies
heavily
on
sherbert
v.
verner;
in
fact,
almost
exclusively.
therefore,
the
indiana
supreme
court
looked
to
sherbert
and
attempted
to
distinguish
it.
the
court,
the
indiana
supreme
court
noted
that
the
opinion
in
sherbert
specifically
limits
itself.
the
language
says,
"we
do
not
by
our
decision
today
declare
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
right
to
unemployment
benefits
on
the
part
of
all
persons...
all
persons
whose
religious
convictions
are
the
cause
of
their
unemployment.
"
now,
despite
that
clear
language,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
says
that
all
persons
are
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
under
sherbert.
now
sherbert
didn't
say
that.
it
said,
we
do
not
make
that
finding.
mr.
william
e.
daily
well,
i
agree
that
there
may
be
a
spectrum
here,
going
from
that
situation
perhaps
to
a
sherbert.
mr.
william
e.
daily
and
the
petitioner
did
not
deny
that
that
person
should...
in
fact,
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
if
there
is
a
sincere
religious
conviction,
sincerely
held
by
an
individual,
that
person
is
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
no
matter
what
his
conviction
is,
even
if
it
is
that
i
should
not
be
required
to
work
at
all.
mr.
william
e.
daily
no.
obviously
not.
mr.
william
e.
daily
in
the
indiana
courts?
mr.
william
e.
daily
i'm
not
prepared
to
discuss
that;
i'm
sorry.
to
continue
my
distinguishment
of
sherbert,
sherbert
involved
a
situation
where
south
carolina
had
a
state
law
giving
benefits
to
sunday
worshipers.
sherbert
extended
that
same
privilege
to
saturday
worshipers.
there
is
no
comparable
situation
in
the
case
before
you
today.
we
are
not
dealing
with
giving
equality
to
saturday
worshipers
that
sunday
worshipers
already
have.
sherbert
found
that
the
highest
state
court
had
not
been
able
to
point
out
any
state
interest.
in
this
case
the
indiana
supreme
court
clearly
points
out
the
state
interest
to
be
protected
and
those
state
interests,
if
i
may
skip
to
another
point,
are
to
promote
the
stability
in
employment,
to
protect
the
citizens
from
the
hardships
of
unemployment,
preserving
the
unemployment
fund.
those
state
interests
are
in
my
opinion
as
compelling
or
more
compelling
than
some
of
the
state
interests
already
upheld
in
this
court.
and
there
i
will
refer
you
to
braunfeld
v.
brown,
reynolds--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--that
is
correct.
and
those
state
interests
would
exist
here,
in
addition
to
the
interests
that
i
have
listed.
in
this
case,
however,
we
have
the
highest
court
of
the
state
finding
that
those
interests
that
i
have
listed
are
sufficient
to
sustain
the
statute.
similar
cases
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
other
ways
to
achieve
the
secular
state
purposes
or
achieve
the
interest
established
by
the
case.
and
i
note
that
the
petitioners
have
not
pointed
out
any
other
ways
to
achieve
these
secular
interests
or
secular
purposes.
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
indiana
supreme
court,
that
court
based
its
decision
on
three
general
and
independent
grounds.
there
are
three
different
grounds
for
sustaining
the
indiana
court's
opinion.
first
of
all,
the
court
found
that
the
statutory
good
cause
requirement
has
a
valid
secular
purpose
and
a
valid
secular
effect.
in
other
words,
the
braunfeld
v.
brown
test.
under
that
test
we
have
a
valid
secular
purpose,
a
valid
secular
effect;
it
is
therefore
a
constitutional
statute.
secondly,
the
indiana
supreme
court
found
that
the
grant
of
an
exemption
to
mr.
thomas
would
conflict
with
the
establishment
clause
in
the
constitution,
as
a
second
independent
grounds,
also
requiring
that
the
statute
be
found
to
be
constitutional.
thirdly,
the
supreme
court
went
into
the--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--to
that
extent
i
am
arguing
for
a
modification
of
sherbert
v.
verner.
mr.
william
e.
daily
to
the
extent
that
that
has
been
found
by
other
courts,
i
think
it
should
be
modified.
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
question
now.
in
walz
v.
the
new
york
tax
commission,
this
court
noted
that
past
opinions
had
considerable
internal
inconsistency
because
of
certain
sweeping
statements.
this
court
also
recognized
that
there
could
be
a
potential
conflict
between
the
religion
clauses,
and
a
test
proposed
in
walz
v.
new
york
tax
commission
is,
first
of
all,
examine
the
legislative
purpose;
secondly,
examine
the
degree
of
involvement
between
church
and
state.
the
current
indiana
practice
withstands
these
tests.
legislative
purpose
is
a
valid
secular
purpose,
the
degree
of
involvement
is
almost
zero.
the
only
reason
that
the
court
had
to
examine
the
sincerity
or
the
contents
of
mr.
thomas's
beliefs
was
because
it
had
to
distinguish
sherbert,
or
perhaps
wisconsin
v.
yoder.
under
the
current
procedure
in
indiana
there
is
really
no
reason
beyond
those
cases
for
an
examination
or
for
an
involvement
of
the
church
with
the
state.
however,
if
the
state
were
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
persons
in
mr.
thomas's
situation
are
exempt
from
the
objective
good
cause
requirement,
if
you
examine
that
statute,
the
statute
proposed
by
mr.
thomas
here...
although
mr.
thomas
is
not
proposing
a
statute,
he's
proposing
the
court
do
something
to
the
same
effect,
to
create
for
indiana
an
exemption.
if
the
court
were
to
create
that
exemption
or
if
the
legislature
in
indiana
were
to
create
that
exemption
and
were
examined
under
the
walz
test,
you
would
have
to
find
a
secular
legislative
purpose
for
an
exemption
for
people
in
mr.
thomas's
situation.
now
i
submit
that
there
is
no
reasonable
secular
purpose
for
that
exemption.
i
don't
think
you
will
find
a
reasonable
purpose
stated
in
the
briefs.
i've
noted
one
amicus
brief
seems
to
think
that
a
secular
purpose
would
be
avoidance
of
conflict
with
the
religion
clauses
and
that
argument
seems
to
me
somewhat
circular.
you
can
point
out
as
a
secular
purpose
for
the
denial
of
the
relief
an
avoidance
of
conflict
with
the
establishment
clause.
in
any
event,
there
is
no
valid
secular
purpose
for
the
establishment
of
exemption;
the
degree
of
involvement
escalates
terrifically
if
you
grant
an
exemption
for
religious
purposes.
then
it
becomes
necessary
to
examine
mr.
thomas
or
people
in
his
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
actually
has
a
sincere
belief.
you
have
to
examine
whether
or
not
that
belief
is
a
religious
belief,
as
opposed
to
a
merely
personal
belief.
and
you
run
into
the
problem
that
mr.
rehnquist
suggested
in
one
of
his
early
questions:
if
you
create
that
exemption
statutorily,
you
run
into
the
problem
of
the
conscientious
objector
cases
and
you
perhaps
have
to
interpret
the
statutory
exemption
in
such
a
way
that
it
applies
to
everybody
whether
it's
a
religious
exemption
or
merely
a
deeply
held
personal
conviction.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i
think
mr.
thomas
stated
that
his
beliefs,
it
was
a
personal
religious
belief.
mr.
william
e.
daily
directly
involved
in
it;
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i
think
that's
clear
from
the
record,
that
his
only
objection
was
to
being
put
on
an
assembly
line
where
he
could
clearly
see
what
he
was
making.
in
other
words,
if
tanks
or
guns
of
some
sort
were
going
past
him
on
the
assembly
line,
then
he
found
it
conflicted
with
his
personal
beliefs.
whereas
if
a
few
steel--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--yes,
in
my
view
it's
very
clear
that
as
long
as
it
were
something
that
he
could
not
recognize
as
a
weapon,
he
had
no--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--i'm
not
sure
that
he
relied
on
his
jehovah's
witness
beliefs,
but
on
his
beliefs.
mr.
william
e.
daily
that's
the
point
i'm
making.
it
was
mr.
thomas'
beliefs
and
not
necessarily
jehovah's
witness
beliefs.
mr.
william
e.
daily
on
the
record
in
this
case
that's
true.
i
think
if
you'll
notice
in
the
reply
brief
by
petitioner,
it
is
apparently
a
matter
of
conscience
by
individual
jehovah's
witnesses
rather...
there's
a
paragraph
in
the
reply
brief
that
seems
to
indicate
that
individual
jehovah's
witnesses
may
examine
their
own
conscience
and
make
their
own
determinations
as
to
whether
or
not
to
work
in
certain
fields.
mr.
william
e.
daily
on
the
record
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
make
that
determination.
mr.
william
e.
daily
examining
the
record
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
in
indiana
could
not
find
a
basis
for
finding
that
this
was
a
tenet.
mr.
william
e.
daily
well,
the
minority
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
felt
that
sherbert
should
be
given
broad
application
and
did
not
go
into
the
facts.
so
they
thought
that
sherbert
applied
across
the
board,
and
therefore
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
daily
that's
so.
mr.
william
e.
daily
i
think
that
it
is
rooted
in
his
claim
that
his
personal
interpretation
of
the
doctrine
required
him
to
reach
that
decision.
mr.
william
e.
daily
there
are
a
number
of...
well,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
jehovah's
witnesses
are
willing
to
work
on
a
tank
in
this
factory.
there
are
jehovah's
witnesses
working
there.
mr.
william
e.
daily
yes.
there
is--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--there
is
no
other--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--i'm
sorry;
the
turret
for
the
tank.
i
should
be
specific
there.
mr.
william
e.
daily
that
is
my
interpretation
of
the
braunfeld
criteria.
mr.
william
e.
daily
under
that
interpretation
refusal
to
work
on
saturday
would
not
be
good
cause.
mr.
william
e.
daily
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
e.
daily
the
third
one
was
the
factual
issues
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
religious
tenet
involved,
whether
or
not
he
held
that
religious
principle,
a
number...
in
effect,
everything
i've
said
about
distinguishing
sherbert.
mr.
william
e.
daily
all
right.
that's
the--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--that
is
certainly
correct
from
the
record.
mr.
william
e.
daily
yes.
there
are
a
number
of
tests
under
the
establishment
clause
arising
out
of
the
aid
to
school
cases.
mr.
william
e.
daily
yes,
it
is.
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--i
understand
that
you
incline
towards
giving
credit
to
the
interpretation
by
the
state
of
its
own--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--and
that
you
would--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--i
would
limit
that
to
the
extent
that
you
may
go
to
the
record
if
the
state's
determination
is
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
william
e.
daily
the
problem
on
this
factual
record
is,
of
course,
that
there
was
no
participation
by
anybody
opposed
to
mr.
thomas
so
we
have
to
examine
what
he
said
now
as
to
the
threshold
question
as
to
when
you
begin
that
examination.
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that.
mr.
william
e.
daily
they
definitely
said
that
he
had
not
clearly
stated
a
religious
principle
that
they
could
find
in
his
testimony.
they
did
not...
the
burden
of
proof
was
obviously
on
the
petitioner
at
this
point.
i
think
you
can
interpret
their
holding
to
say
that
he
failed
to
meet
his
burden
of
proof.
mr.
william
e.
daily
no,
he
did
not
prevail
at
the
two
lower
levels.
the
only
point
at
which
he
prevailed
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
daily
they
agreed
with
him
on
that
point,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
daily
yes.
mr.
william
e.
daily
they
said
that
on
the
record
they
could
not
sustain
the
finding
below
that
he
had
a
clear
religious
conviction.
mr.
william
e.
daily
of
the
board.
mr.
william
e.
daily
that
goes
perhaps
farther
than--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--i
think
that
would
go
further
than
i
could
go
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
at
least
that
statement
of
their
holding.
they
could...
the
record
clearly
shows
that
he
had,
that
he
quit
work
because
he
did
not
want
to
work
on
the
turrets,
the
tank
turrets.
mr.
william
e.
daily
that's
true.
and
i
don't
think
that...
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
did
not
find
any
clear
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
that's
why
he
quit.
i'd
like
to
point
to...
a
minute...
to
a
fairly
recent
case
of
this
court
called
twa
v.
hardison.
in
that
case
this
court
said,
"we
will
not
readily
construe
a
statute
to
require
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
some
employees
in
order
to
enable
others
to
celebrate
their
sabbath.
"
i
am
hopeful
that
that
to
some
extent
modifies
sherbert.
at
least
the
dissent
thought
that
it
did.
and
i
think
it
does
too,
and
i
think
the
basic
principle
in
twa
v.
hardison
is
equality
under
the
law.
petitioner
in
this
case--
mr.
william
e.
daily
--sherbert
was
addressed
to
a
state
action.
this
is
an
employer
action
involving
a
statutory
mention
of
religion
which
is
the
same
thing
that
the
petitioners
want
us
to
do
here,
create
an
exemption
for
religion.
i
think
the
reasoning
is
analogous,
even
though
the
factual
situation
is
different.
this
court
has
frequently
stated
that
the
court
should
allow
the
legislature
to
assess
the
public
need
and
should
not
strike
down
a
neutral
state
action
within
the
state's
power
even
if
that
action
approaches
the
verge
or
the
limits
of
the
power.
that's
from
everson
v.
board
of
education.
the
court
realizes
the
potential
conflict
between
establishment
and
freedom
that
was
realized
in
walz
v.
tax
commissioners.
as
justice
white
noted
in
dissent
in
welsh
v.
u.
s.,
congress
or
in
this
case
the
state
should
have
some
leeway
in
interpreting
the
religion
clauses.
in
this
case
the
state
has
adopted
a
neutral
position.
that
position
does
not
clearly
establish
a
religion
nor
does
it
directly
infringe
upon
religious
freedoms.
i
am
making
the
same
plea
that
every
attorney
general
probably
does
before
you
and
ask
that
you
recognize
the
federal
system
and
adopt
a
hands-off
approach
in
this
particular
situation.
the
legislature
of
indiana
has
assessed
the
public
need,
as
required
in
everson
v.
board
of
education.
the
statute
is
neutral,
as
required
in
that
estate,
and
even
though
there
is
an
indirect,
there
may
be
an
indirect
burden
on
mr.
thomas
in
this
case,
that
does
not
by
itself
give
rise
to
a
requirement
that
a
statute
otherwise
neutral,
with
a
secular
purpose
and
a
secular
effect,
should
be
stricken
down.
thank
you.
i'm
sorry.
any
further
questions?
