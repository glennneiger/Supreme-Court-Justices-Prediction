mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1963
this
court
held
that
the
denial
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
a
person
who
refuses
otherwise
available
and
suitable
work
for
religious
reasons
was
a
denial
of
that
person's
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
with
facts
very
similar
to
those
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
sherbert
v.
verner,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
has
upheld
the
denial
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
the
petitioner,
eddie
c.
thomas.
the
facts
before
this
court
which
were
determined
by
the
referee
of
the
division
and
affirmed
by
the
review
board
reveal
the
following.
mr.
thomas
was
specially
hired
into
the
roll
foundry
of
respondent,
blaw-knox.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
record
but
i
can
inform
the
court
that
the
roll
foundry
was
engaged
in
the
production
of
steel
rolls
to
be
used
in
the
steel
industry.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
it
is
possible;
yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
again,
the
record
does
not
reveal
that.
it
is
possible
that
some
of
these
rolls
went
to
other
divisions
of
blaw-knox.
now,
some
of
these
rolls
were
also
sold
to
other
steel
mills
in
the
area,
like
bethelehem
steel,
inland
steel,
for
different
and
varied
purposes.
mr.
thomas
was
working
in
the
roll
foundry
for
approximately
a
year.
the
record
revealed
that
this
division
was
not
engaged
in
the
production
of
armaments.
he
worked
as
a
chainman
"hooker"
and
he
was
involuntarily
transferred
to
the
tank
turret
line
after
a
year.
when
mr.
thomas
was
transferred
to
the
tank
turret
line,
he
realized
that
his
new
job
involved
the
direct
manufacture
of
armaments.
at
this
time--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--yes.
when
he
became
an
employee
of
blaw-knox
he
listed
in
his
initial
application
for
employment,
"religion...
jehovah's
witness".
and
"hobbies...
bible
study
and
bible
reading.
"
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
it's
not
clear
from
the
record.
the
transcript
of
the--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--well,
the
record
reveals
that
he
was
going
to
ask
the
congregation
to
make
a
decision
but
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
the
congregation
made
the
decision.
however,
mr.
thomas
did
reach
a
decision
that
the
work
he
was
performing
in
the
tank
turret
line
was
against
his
religious
belief.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
seems
to
attack,
not
his
sincerity,
but
the
nature
and
the
basis
of
his
belief.
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
essentially
says,
well,
it
isn't
clear
what
his
belief
is
and
the
nature
and
basis
of
the
same.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes.
and
then
they
say,
even
if
it's
a
religious
belief,
it's
not
a
cardinal
tenet
of
his
religion
and
it's
not
shared
by
the
congregation.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes.
they
are
irrelevant.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
a
belief,
a
religious
belief
which
is
sincerely
held,
even
though
it's
not
consistent--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--yes,
yes,
mr.
justice,
even
though
it's
not
consistent
with
the
philosophy...
excuse
me,
consistent
with
but
not
adopted
by
the
religion
to
which
this
person
belongs
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
that's
essentially
our
claim
before
this
court.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
no,
the
facts
appear
in
the
record
in
the
decision
of
the
referee
that
was
affirmed
by
the
review
board.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
supreme
court
seems
to
challenge
the
fact
but
never
reverses
or
modifies
those
facts.
in
fact,
they
say,
"we
affirm
the
review
board".
they
raise
this
question
but
never
reverse
the
review
board.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
that
is
possible;
yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
we
would
have
to
look
at
that
claim
under
the
test
that
the
courts
have
advanced,
is
this
a
religious
belief
and
is
it
sincerely
held?
but
that
is
not
our
case.
he
has
not
become
a
nonproductive
member
of
society,
he
has
just
said,
i
will
not
work
in
the
production
of
armaments,
but
i
am
willing,
able,
and
available
to
return
to
the
roll
foundry
or
to
work
in
any
other
type
of
work
that
does
not
violate
my
religious
belief.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
this
is
a
constitutional
claim
and
that
definition
of
religion
which
was
adopted
in
seeger
and
welsh
has
not
been
expanded
to
the
first
amendment.
and
we
are
saying
that
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case
because
he
belongs
to
a
well-established
and
known
religion
that
is
no
stranger
to
the
federal
judiciary,
the
jehovah's
witnesses,
and
we
don't
need
to
look
for
an
answer
in
seeger
or
welsh.
the
referee
concluded
that
mr.
thomas
quit
for
religious
reasons
because
as
a
jehovah's
witness
he
was
specifically
exempted
from
aiding
in
or
producing
armaments
used
in
the
advancement
of
war.
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana
said
that
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute
in
that
with
those
facts
sherbert
was
controlling.
the
court
of
appeals
of
indiana
held
that
the
disqualifying
provisions
of
the
indiana
code
22-4-15-1
as
applied
to
thomas
imposed
a
burden
on
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
because
the
review
board
conceded
that
they
had
no
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
any
infringement,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
review
board
and
awarded
benefits
to
thomas.
the
case
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
on
a
petition
to
transfer
filed
by
the
board.
in
a
3-2
decision
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
attempts
to
distinguish
sherbert
and
in
doing
so
applies
erroneous
standards.
like
we
said
before,
the
supreme
court
said,
well,
it
isn't
clear
what
his
belief
was
and
the
basis
of
his
belief.
if
it's
religious,
it's
not
a
cardinal
tenet,
and
even
if
it
is
religious,
it's
not
shared
by
all
of
the
congregation.
these
are
erroneous
standards.
there's
no
requirement
that
this
be
a
cardinal
tenet
of
the
religion
to
which
this
person
belongs
or
that
it
be
shared
by
all
the
members
of
the
congregation.
the
critical
point
is
whether
this
is
a
religious
belief
and
whether
it
is
sincerely
held
by
this
individual.
that,
as
i
said,
is
the
threshold
inquiry.
the
answer
to
both
questions
in
thomas's
case
is,
yes.
thomas'
belief
is
religious
in
nature.
he
is
a
jehovah's
witness.
nobody
has
questioned
that
thus
far.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
from
reading
the
cases
that
this
court
has
had
before
it
involving
jehovah's
witnesses
opposed
to
military
service,
it
is
clear
they
oppose
all
the
wars
of
this
world.
and
i
refer
to
the
sicurella
case,
a
1955
decision
of
this
court.
mr
thomas
describes
his
beliefs
as
religious
and
i
would
like
to,
if
the
court
allows
me,
read
from
a
transcript
of
the
referee
before
the
hearing...
from
the
hearing
before
the
referee.
thomas
says,
and
i
quote:
"i
really
could
not,
you
know,
conscientiously
continue
to
work
with
armaments.
"
"it
would
be
against
all
of
the
religious
principles
that
i
have
come
to
learn
and
appreciate
except
up
to
this
point.
"
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
then
he
could
have
concluded
that
thomas
quit
for
personal
reasons,
but
he
didn't
do
that.
in
fact
he
said,
the
referee,
oh,
i
can
understand,
i
can
see
your
difficulty,
and
i
have
the
utmost
respect
for
your
religious
principles.
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
transcript.
those
are
the
words
of
the
referee.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
never
said
that.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
then
they
would
have
reversed
the
conclusion
of
the
referee
and
we
would
still
be
here
because
we
think
that
the
record
supports
the
conclusion
of
the
referee.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
the
supreme
court
said--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--well,
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
okay.
then
i
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
was
wrong
if
they
in
fact
reversed
the
referee,
because
the
evidence
in
the
record
reveals
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
the
constitutional
claim
is
a
federal
question.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
it
would
not
be
a
federal
question
if
we
didn't
have
a
free
exercise
claim
involved.
but
this
court
has
held
that
when
free
exercise
or
constitutional
claims
are
involved
it
is
free
to
review
the
facts
and
come
to
its
own
conclusion,
especially
when
the
constitutional
claim
is
denied
on
facts
as
determined
by
the--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
this
court
is
free--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--well,
the
court
can
look
at
the
record
to
determine
if--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--are
you
asking
me
if
he
did
or
if
the
court
can
look--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--i
believe
this
court
can.
again,
we
submit
that
mr.
thomas'
opposition
to
working
with
armaments
is
a
belief
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
court
cannot--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--again,
i
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
test,
is
this
a
religious
belief,
and
is
it
sincerely
held?
that
would
be
the
answer,
the
only
answer
in
every
case
where
a
person
raises
the
constitutional
claim;
we're
going
to
have
to
face
that
threshold
question.
and
then,
if
the
answer
is
yes
on
both
questions,
then
we're
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
test
as
advanced
in
sherbert,
which
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
fails
to
do.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
no,
we
don't
have
them
in
here.
in
looking
at
the
sincerity,
since
the
courts
according
to
the
doctrines
of
fowler
and
united
states
v.
ballard
cannot
inquire
into
the
validity
of
the
belief,
the
courts
can
and
do,
most
of
the
time,
look
into
the
sincerity.
in
a--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--the
trial
court,
the
appellate
court.
they're
not
prevented,
you
know,
from
looking
at
the
sincerity
of
the
belief.
once
a
first
amendment
claim
or
a
constitutional
claim
is
raised,
then
the
courts
must
answer
those
two
questions:
if
this
is
a
religious
belief,
is
it
sincerely
held?
and
in
looking
at
sincerity,
consistency
with
a
belief,
consistency
of
this
belief
with
the
tenets
of
a
well-established
religion
may
be
persuasive
on
the
issue
of
this
person's
sincerity
but
it's
not
conclusive.
there
are
other
extrinsic
facts
that
the
courts
can
consider
to
determine
sincerity.
one
of
those
is,
what
role
does
religion
play
in
the
life
of
this
individual?
in
thomas's
case
we
submit
that
religion
plays
a
central
role
in
his
life.
he's
a
jehovah's
witness,
his
hobbies
are
bible
study
and
bible
reading.
his
belief
is
consistent
with
the
tenets
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
who
are
opposed
to
war.
furthermore,
mr.
thomas
was
willing
to
take
a
50
percent
cut
in
his
income
in
order
to
live
his
life
according
to
his
religious
belief.
and
that,
we
submit,
shows
that
his
belief
was
religious
in
nature
and
sincerely
held.
the
analysis,
then,
in
a
free
exercise
case,
is,
is
there
a
burden
on
the
free
exercise
of
religion?
and
if
there
is,
is
it
justified
by
a
compelling
state
interest?
in
this
case
we
believe
that
there
is
an
infringement
on
his
first
amendment
rights,
the
same
infringement
that
this
court
found
in
sherbert
vs.
verner.
mr.
thomas'
ineligibility
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
derives
solely
from
the
practice
of
his
religion.
like
in
sherbert,
he
is
forced
to
choose
between
following
the
precepts
of
his
religion
and
forfeiting
benefits
on
the
one
hand,
or
abandoning
the
precepts
of
his
religion
to
remain
employed,
on
the
other
hand.
this,
this
court
has
held,
is
an
unconstitutional
choice.
and
this
same
test
had
been
applied
in
mcdaniel
v.
paty
and
wisconsin
v.
yoder.
the
review
board
has
conceded
that
it
has
no
compelling
state
interest
to
justify
the
infringement
on
thomas's
first
amendment
rights.
no
compelling
state
interest
was
raised
or
briefed
before
the
state
courts
below,
and
now
the
review
board
for
the
first
time
in
these
proceedings
has
attempted
to
introduce
before
this
court
a
compelling
state
interest.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
it
will
not
consider
matters
raised
here
for
the
first
time
which
were
never
briefed
or
raised
in
the
lower
courts
below.
it
will
do
so
only
when
there
is
plain
error,
and
we
submit
that
is
not
in
this
case,
that
is
not
our
case.
there's
a
concession
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest.
and
under
those
circumstances
we
respectfully
request
this
court
that
the
infringement
on
thomas's
first
amendment
rights
not
be
tolerated.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes?
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes.
we
submit
that
sherbert
expanded
the
test
advanced
in
braunfeld
and
this
court
has
not
expressly
overruled
braunfeld
although
in
recent
decisions...
i
believe
in
the
wisconsin
v.
yoder
or
mcdaniel
v.
paty.
justice
brennan
indicated
that
candor
compels
an
admission
that
braunfeld
has
been
overruled.
i
think
what--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--no,
it
has
not
been
overruled,
but
i
think
that
the
court
has
expanded
the
test
to
require
the
state
a
greater
burden
of
proof
when
there
is
an
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights,
which
was
not
the
test
in
braunfeld.
braunfeld
has
been,
i
think,
not
overruled
but
severely
limited
by
the
test
in
sherbert,
which
this
court
has
consistently
applied
ever
since
sherbert
was
decided.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes.
americans
united
for
separation
of
church
and
state.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
it's
in
east
chicago,
indiana.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
finally,
we
would
like
to
indicate
that
granting
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
the
petitioner
does
not
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
this
argument
was
rejected
in
sherbert,
and
also
in
mcdaniel
v.
paty,
decided
by
this
court
in
1978.
all
that
the
state
is
doing
in
granting
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
thomas
is
acting
with
neutrality
in
the
light
of
serious
religious
differences
in
our
nation.
this
court
has
characterized
itself
for
encouraging
benevolent
neutrality,
the
doctrine
of
flexibility
in
its
approach
to
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
is
erroneous,
that
it
should
be
reversed,
and
that
thomas
should
be
entitled
to
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
we
would
like
to
reserve
the
time
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes,
taxes
from...
contributions--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--i
believe
it's
both
state
funds
and
employers;
yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
no,
i
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
i
believe
there
is
none.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
the
problem
is
that
the
employer
in
this
case,
if
thomas
had
filed
a
title
vii,
could
not
accommodate
him,
because
all
of
the
other
divisions
except
the
roll
foundry
were
engaged
in
the
production
of
armaments.
and
thomas
did
not
file
a
title
vii.
he
filed
for
a--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--oh,
yes,
but
there
was
no
such
job,
apparently.
the
record
reveals
that
he
sought
the
transfer
immediately
upon
being
assigned
to
the
tank
turret
line.
and
in
seeking
this
transfer
he
realized
that
all
of
the
other
functions
at
blaw-knox
were
directly
involved
with
the
manufacture
of
armaments.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
the
employer
and
the
state.
not
only
the
employer.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
i
believe
so.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
state
funds...
well,
there's
state
funds
and
employers'
contributions,
i
believe.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes,
it
is,
and
that
issue
has
never
been
raised
by
the
board
or--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--probably.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
thank
you.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
first
we
would
like
to
address
the
contention
of
the
respondent
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
said
there
was
there
was
a
concession
of
no
compelling
state
interest
and
we
would
like
to
address
the
attention
of
the
court
to
pages
13(a)
and
19(a)
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
where
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
said
that
the
task
of
applying
sherbert
in
this
case
is
focused
by
the
board's
concession
in
oral
argument
that
no
compelling
state
interest
exists
in
this
case
to
justify
an
infringement.
so
it
is
very
clear,
there
was
a
concession
in
oral
argument.
second,
the
board
contends
that
in
sherbert
there
was
a
discriminatory
effect
in
relation
to
sunday
worshipers
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
sherbert
was
decided
on
first
amendment,
not
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
provision.
also,
the
interests
now
asserted
by
the
state
for
the
first
time
before
this
court
in
these
proceedings
were
already
rejected
in
sherbert
like
justice
stevens
pointed...
and
this
court
has
stated
that
only
the
gravest
abuses
endangering
paramount
interests
permit
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights.
those
grave
abuses
are
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
that
would
be
different
from
our
case
because
that
would
indicate
knowledge
on
this
petitioner
that
that
job
was
in
conflict
with
his
religious
beliefs.
and
i
have
to
admit
that
he
could
not
accept
that
job
and
then
allege
that
his
free
exercise
rights
had
been
violated,
because
he
had
knowledge.
but
in
this
case
he
didn't.
the
referee
concluded
that
it
wasn't
until
he
was
transferred
to
the
tank
turret
line
that
he
realized
the
armament-producing
nature
of
blaw-knox.
so
he
would
not
put
himself
in
a
position
of
having
a
conflict
with
his
religious
beliefs.
also--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--we
will
still
argue
that
the
first
amendment
protects
that
belief
because
it's
religious
in
nature,
it's
sincerely
held.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
that
is
consistent
with
the
tenet
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
and
would
also
be
a
belief
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
then
we
would
have
to
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
definition
of
religion
in
seeger
and
welsh,
which
has
not
been
extended
to
the
first
amendment
as
of
today.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
okay,
then,
we
would
have
to
look,
as
i
said,
to
the
test
of
sincerity
and
religious
nature
and
how
central
this
belief
is
to
the
life
of
this
individual.
the
court
has
often
emphasized
the
centrality
of
the
belief
to
determine
sincerity,
and
to
that
effect
are
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
teterud
v.
burns,
1979
decision,
i
believe,
and
other
decisions
of
lower
federal
courts.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
what
we're
saying
is
that
if--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--pardon?
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
he
doesn't
need
the
backing
of
the
well-known
religious
organization
to
come
to
this
court
and
urge
protection
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
but
in
this
case
that
backing
is
persuasive
as
to
the
issue
of
sincerity
and
is
very
crucial.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes;
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
then
i
would
have
to
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
definition
of
religion
in
seeger
and
welsh.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes,
there
is
one.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
as
we
indicate
in
our
reply
brief,
the
jehovah's
witnesses
encourage
their
members
to
read
and
study
the
bible
and
get
their
own
teachings
from
it.
it's
the
practice
that
they
do
encourage
and
they
have
to
come
to
their
own
decision.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
that's
correct.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
they
did
not
view
working
there
as
unscriptural,
while
mr.
thomas
did.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
i
would
say
that
the
belief
is
religious
in
nature
because
she's
saying
that--
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
--yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
well,
we
are
submitting
that
the
pressure
from
the
congregation
is
not
a
necessary
element
of
a
protected
expression
of
religious
belief.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
his
interpretation;
yes.
mr.
mrs
blanca
bianchi
de
la
torre
thank
you.
