what
if
the
referee
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
had
said,
i
don't
believe
mr.
thomas?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
had
said
after
the
referee
said
what
you
have
just
quoted
him
as
saying,
we
find
that
the
referee
committed
reversible
error
in
believing
thomas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
it
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
the...
the
referee
said
he
quit
for
religious
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
supreme
court
said,
we
disagree.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
certainly
interpret
what
they
were
disagreeing
with
as
including
the
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
if
they
disagree
with
the
referee
on
that
fact-finding,
where
are
you?
justice
white
--if
he
quit
for
religious
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
how
the
compensation
is
financed
in
indiana?
is
it
by
assessments
on
employers?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
state
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
the
employer
pays
depends
on
his
rate
of
unemployment,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
that
this
man,
under
title
vii
or
something,
that
he
was
discharged
for
religious
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
he
have
been
willing
to
take
a
job
as
clerk
in
an
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
employer
must
now
pay
him,
in
effect;
pay
him
unemployment
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
state
funds
in
this
fund?
justice
white
well,
who
litigates
before
the
review
board?
the
employer?
justice
white
--and
the
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
says...
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
said
he
was
uncertain
as
to
his
precise
beliefs,
and
said
that
his
reasons
for
quitting
work
were
unclear.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
said,
whether...
totally
aside
from
what
the
record
says,
but
that
was
its
reading
of
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said,
not
only
is
it
unclear
what
his
belief
was
but
that
it
was
unclear
why
he
quit
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
even
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
it
may
be
so
that
he
didn't
want
to
work
on
the
tank
turrets
but
it
would
still
be
a
question
of
whether
he
quit
because
of
a
religious
belief.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
suppose
that
his
request
to
the
jehovah's
witnesses
had
been
answered
by
the
religious
body
saying,
there's
nothing
contrary
to
our
religion
to
work
in
the
turret
factory.
and
he
said,
well,
that's
maybe
your
view
of
it
as
a
group,
but
my
own
personal
religious
beliefs
prevent
me
from
doing
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
you
say
it's
religion.
what
if
he
says,
well,
i
just
don't
believe
i
should...
i
just
don't
believe
in
war.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing,
then,
if
a
person
went
to
his
employer
and
said,
i
can't
work
in
a
turret
factory,
i'm
going
to
quit,
and
the
employer
said,
well,
why?
justice
white
i
have
a
religious
belief.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
employer
said,
well,
what
religion
are
you
a
member
of?
and
he
says,
none
except
mine.
i'm
a
one-man,
i
have
a
one-man
religion.
and...
but
it's
religious.
i
think
it's
contrary
to
the
laws
of
god
to
go
to
war
or
to
even
work
on
the
implements
of
war.
you
would
be
here
in
the
same
capacity--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
no,
he
would
say,
this
isn't
just
conscientious.
i
categorize
my
beliefs
as
religious.
justice
white
but
which
all
members
do
not
follow,
apparently.
justice
white
but
some
of
them...
not
all
jehovah's
witnesses
refuse
to
work
in
the
turret
factory.
justice
white
and
at
least
some
of
them
thought
it
was
wholly
consistent
with
the
tenets
of
the
sect,
or
of
the
religion.
justice
white
you
agree
that
the
group
as
a
whole
do
not
make
this
a
tenet,
that
they
don't
have
a
rule
against
working
in
turret
factories.
they
leave
it
up
to
each
individual
to
study
the
scriptures
and
come
to
his
own
conclusions
as
to
what
his
religious
belief
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fellow
who
works
in
the
turret
factory
is
acting
just
as
consistently
with
the
jehovah's
witnesses
tenets
as
the
fellow
who
doesn't.
justice
white
yes.
