paul

it's
a
pretty
small
point,
but
where
is
the
blaw-knox
factory
located?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
east
chicago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
sort
of
proceeding
would
the
review
board
put
in
such
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
we...
if
we
thought
compelling
state
interest
was
relevant,
we
should
send
it
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
does,
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
daily,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
correct
to
say
that
there
were
no
state
interests
involved
in
sherbert.
the
opinion
noted
that
there
was
a
state
interest
in
preventing
spurious
claims
which
would
also
be
present
here,
and
also
a
state
interest
in
not
making,
complicating
the
work
schedule
that
the
employer
has
to
worry
about
putting
people
on,
when
people
can't
work
on
saturdays.
so
there
were
state
interests
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
daily,
wasn't
that
argument
specifically
rejected
in
verner,
both
by
the
majority
and
by
the
dissenters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
you
asked
for
the
modification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
daily,
you
were
telling
us
the
three
reasons
for
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
decision.
the
first
was
that
it
didn't
come
within
the
state
good
cause
requirement.
the
state
supreme
court
said
good
cause
has
to
be
a
valid
objective
job-related
reason,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
under
that
interpretation,
refusal
to
work
on
saturday
would
not
be
good
cause,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
part
of
the
supreme
court
decision
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
sherbert,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
was
the
third
reason?
you
didn't
get
to
the
third,
but
the
second
one
is,
you
agreed
that
we'd
have
to
modify
sherbert
also
to
accept
the
second
ground,
so
i'm
interested
in...
what
was
it?
i
forget
what
the
third
one
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
daily,
as
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
they're
saying
the
resolution
of
this
issue
is
somewhat
unclear.
they
didn't
resolve
it
definitely
one
way
or
the
other,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
prevailed
on
the
fact
issue
before
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
industrial
review
board
and
the
court
of
appeals,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
get
the
award;
i
understand
that.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
his
belief
was
a
sincere
religious
belief,
they
both
agreed
with
him,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
that
necessarily
follow?
supposing
you
had
a
catholic
nurse
employed
in
a
hospital
and
was
transferred
into
the
abortion
ward,
and
she
said,
well,
it's
against
my
religion
to
work
in
abortions
and
then
they
defend
it
on
the
grounds,
well,
some
other
catholics
will
perform
these
services,
therefore
your
belief
is
not
religious,
is
not
sincere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
people
are
more
religious
than
others
within
the
same
faith,
in
other
words.
