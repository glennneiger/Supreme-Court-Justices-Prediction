there
any

that
his

bona

religious

even

well,
i
think
the...
my
understanding
of
the
reason
for
that
language
in
sherbert
was
to
take
care
of
my
brother
blackmun's
earlier
hypothetical
question
as
to
what
about
the
person
whose
religious
convictions
taught
him
that
it
was
sin
to
work
at
all,
at
anything.
justice
stewart
such
a
person,
say,
in
the
absence
of
that
language
in
sherbert,
could
say,
i'm
entitled
to
workmen's
compensation...
i'm
entitled
to
unemployment
compensation.
justice
stewart
that's
not
this
case.
