chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
now
in
thomas
v.
review
board
of
the
indiana
employment
security
division
et
al.
mrs.
bianchi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
they
make
there,
what
kind
of
fabricating
did
they
do
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
it
might
get
into
tank
turrets,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
trucks
and--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
faith
also
bar
participating
in
national
defense
if
our
country
were
invaded?
does
it
bar...
is
it
total
passive
resistance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
federal
question
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
a
federal
question
on
the
narrow
hypothetical
mr.
justice
white
has
just
posed,
that
the
state
court
has
reversed
the
referee
on
what
could
be
his
credibility
findings?
now,
let's
assume,
hypothetically,
that
reversing
on
credibility
of
witnesses
unseen
by
the
reviewing
court
would
be
an
error
of
some
kind.
is
it
a
federal
question
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
connection
be
so
tenuous
that
the
reviewing
courts
could
reverse?
let
me
take
a
hypothetical
between
some
of...
in
the
mean
between
some
of
the
hypotheticals
suggested.
suppose
he
was
working
in
a
factory
making
threshing
machines
for
farms
and
he
reasoned
that
threshing
machines
would
be
used
to
produce
wheat
which
might
go
to
russia
and
he
does
not
want,
his
religious
belief
forbids
his
doing
anything
to
help
the
communist
world.
would
that
be
in
your
view
too
tenuous
and
speculative
to
sustain
a
religious
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
said
before,
this
being
a
case
involving
turrets
for
tanks,
tanks
are
reasonably
used
only
in
warfare.
we
don't
have
those
difficult
questions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
court?
this
court
in
reviewing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say,
a
state
fund,
is
the
state
any
more
than
a
keeper
of
the
stakes?
that
is,
the
state
impounds
the
money
coming
from
the
employer.
there's
no
tax
on
the
general
public
that
goes
into
this,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
contribution
from
the
employees
in
indiana?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
just
told
me
that
there
was
no
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
conceivably
might
be
important
to
know
whether
any
general
tax
revenues
are
paid.
i'm
not
sure.
the
record
is
silent
on
that,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
your
friend
may
know
the
answer
to
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
answer
is
important.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
daily.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
yoder
help
you
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
the
yoder
case--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--sherbert
v.
verner--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
status
of
people,
if
any,
in
many
of
the
courts,
who
would
have
a
religious
objection
and
scruple
against
participating
in
social
security?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
have
been
some
cases
on
that,
haven't
there,
in
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
is
not
clear
in
this
case
that
his
position
was
placed
entirely
on
his
formal
religious
beliefs
as
distinguished
from
just
disagreeing
with
some
particular
facet
of
a
war,
as
vietnam,
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
personal
religious
belief
against
doing
anything
relating
to
making
the
weapons
of
war,
direct
weapons
of
war?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
backed
that
up
by
saying
that
making
steel
alone,
as
he
had
previously,
was
not
a
barrier,
and
we
can
only
infer
that
he
meant
that
some
of
that
steel
might
go
into
other
purposes,
and
that
he
was
only
raising
the
question
and
he
was
helping
to
make
a
tank,
for
which
there
was
no
use
except
in
war.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
religious
beliefs,
as
a
member
of
jehovah's
witnesses.
didn't
he
make
that
clear,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
not
just
a
general
appeal
to
conscience
in
the
abstract
as
in
the
hypothetical
posed
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
was
specifically
his
membership
and
adherence
to
the
beliefs
of
jehovah's
witnesses
that
he
relied
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
not
unrelated
to
the
beliefs
of
jehovah's
witnesses,
as
a
faith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
the
record
in
that
respect
was
crystal
clear,
open
to
no
possible
doubt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
probably
led
to
the
4-3
decision
in
the
indiana
supreme
court
to
some
extent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
fact
that
some
other
employees
who
were
members
of
jehovah's
witnesses
did
not
take
the
same
view
of
the
matter,
there's
nothing
unique
in
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
members
of
any
given
faith,
whether
catholic
or
presbyterian
or
whatnot,
have
more
literal
constructions
of
their
own
faith,
but
it's
still
rooted
back
to
his
claim
as
a
jehovah's
witness
adherent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
do
you
say
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
said
about
the
sincere
religious
belief
determination
of
the
court
of
appeals?
didn't
they
say
it
was
unclear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
sherbert
addressed
to
that
kind
of
a
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparently
none.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
these
fallback
positions
do
not
alter
the
fact
that
you
have
an
organized
established
religion
declaring
the
belief
on
which
he
relies.
chief
justice
burger
well,
you
have
the
further
factor
that
in
the
roman
catholic
faith
you
have
an
authoritarian
determination
of
these
issues
and
yet
people
are
not
excommunicated
just
because
they
don't
follow
all
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
thomas
against
the
review
board
of
the
indiana
employment
security
division
and
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
is
reversed.
justice
blackmun
filed
a
statement
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgments.
justice
rehnquist
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
