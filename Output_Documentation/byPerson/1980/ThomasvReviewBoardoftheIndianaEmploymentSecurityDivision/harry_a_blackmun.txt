justice
blackmun
incidentally,
did
the
congregation
itself
ever
decide
that
issue?
justice
blackmun
the
record's
pretty
obscure...
that's
the
same
answer
you've
given
me
each
time,
and--
justice
blackmun
mrs.
de
la
torre,
suppose
that
mr.
thomas
had
reached
the
point
where
all
work
was
against
his
religious
convictions.
would
you
still
be
here?
justice
blackmun
mrs.
de
la
torre,
in
your
briefs
you
have
not
cited
the
braunfeld
case.
justice
blackmun
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
justice
blackmun
but
has
the
court
overruled
it?
justice
blackmun
well,
i
thought
you
would
have
attacked
it
in
some
way,
anyway.
one
of
the
amicis
did,
but
you
didn't.
justice
blackmun
--you
feel
sherbert
helps
you?
justice
blackmun
do
you
think
that
sherbert
should
be
over-ruled?
justice
blackmun
well,
is
that
true
from
the
record,
when
there
is
another
jehovah's
witness
who
is
not
upset
by
this
situation?
justice
blackmun
so
it
gets
down
to
a
matter
of
a
personal
religious
belief
wholly
apart
from
jehovah's
witnesses?
justice
blackmun
well,
it's
a
factor,
i
suppose,
but
the
fact
that
another
jehovah's
witness
went
the
other
way
would
indicate
it
isn't
a
compelling
factor.
i
don't
believe--
--didn't
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
say
the
question
was
unclear
as
to
why
he
quit?
justice
blackmun
so
you're
close
to
conceding
that
all
this
jehovah's
witness
business
is
irrelevant.
justice
blackmun
for
the
precise
issue
here.
justice
blackmun
for
the
precise
issue
here.
you
are
close
to
conceding
that
the
presence
of
a
jehovah's
witness
connection
is
irrelevant.
he'll
prevail
anyway.
the
church--
justice
blackmun
--but
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white
was
that
eliminating
that
you
would
still
be
here.
