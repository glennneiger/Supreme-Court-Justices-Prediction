justice
stewart
how
old
was
he?
justice
stewart
and
he
had
already
been
formally
charged
at
that
time?
justice
stewart
well,
as
i
understood
their
brief,
they
agree
with
you
here.
justice
stewart
do
you
remember,
offhand,
mr.
meehan,
where
in
the
respondent's
original
brief
there
is
a
concession
that
your
client
had
been
formally
charged
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation?
justice
stewart
i
know
i
read
it
but
i
can't
find
it.
justice
stewart
it's
on
71:
"well,
i
need
a
lawyer.
"
where
did
he
talk
about
making
the
deal?
justice
stewart
wouldn't
it
follow
from
your
logic
that
every
time
there's
a
violation
of
the
protections
of
miranda
there's
a
waiver
of
them?
justice
stewart
it
sounds
to
me
as
though.
justice
stewart
whenever
he
does
talk,
then
he's
waived
the
protections?
justice
stewart
well,
let's
say,
in
every
such
case,
all
right,
i'll
answer
your
questions.
there's
a
waiver
then?
justice
stewart
even
though--
--well,
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
your
logic,
isn't
it?
yes,
it
is.
he's
told
that
he
may
remain
silent
and
he
says,
maybe
one
night
or
maybe
the
next
morning,
i
know
i
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
but
i'm
going
to
talk.
well,
he
didn't
say
that
here.
well,
what
if
he
just
goes
ahead
and
talks?
that's
the
point.
justice
stewart
mr.
mcclennen,
then,
in
your
primary
brief
you
state
in
footnote
47,
on
page
24,
that
the
respondent
state
acknowledges
that
the
petitioner
was
formally
charged
by
the
state
on
january
19,
1976.
have
you
changed
that?
justice
stewart
kirby
v.
illinois.
justice
stewart
well,
of
course,
every
state
is
different.
and
new
york
is
certainly
different
from
arizona.
and
i
had
understood
that
you
had
conceded
that
in
your
state
and
under
your
procedures,
in
arizona,
the
petitioner
had
been
formally
charged
on
the
date
that
you
conceded
he
had
been
charged.
justice
stewart
well,
you
conceded
that
it
did
in
your
brief.
justice
stewart
because
you
cited
a
case
arising
in
a
new
york
procedure.
justice
stewart
and
you
acknowledge,
i'm
sure
you
agree
with
me,
that
each
state
is
somewhat
different
in
its
criminal
procedures.
justice
stewart
well,
it's
your
present
position.
it
wasn't
your
position
in
your
brief.
justice
stewart
and
all
through
this
litigation
it
hasn't
been
your
position,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stewart
well,
how
do
we
know
what
the
arizona
law
is?
we
must
rely
on
you.
you
told
us
in
your
opening
brief
that
he
had
been
formally
charged
on
the
date
mentioned.
well,
i'm
not
sure.
is
that
really
right?
you
didn't
necessarily...
as
i
read
the
footnote,
you
just
conceded
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney.
justice
stewart
they
didn't
talk
about
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments?
justice
stewart
only
the
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination,
which
would
take
the
ground
of
the
miranda
case--
justice
stewart
--well,
it
clearly
wasn't
carefully
and
thoroughly
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
justice
stewart
or
if
it
was,
it
was
done
so
in
silence.
