justice
rehnquist
well,
it
could
be,
mr.
meehan,
that
if
a
crime
occurs
at
11
o'clock
at
night,
that
there
aren't
many
lawyers
willing
to
get
out
of
bed
at
that
hour
of
night
to
provide
the
necessary
support
for
a
defendant,
that
might
be
during
the
daytime.
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
case
was
solved,
was
it
solved
as
to
edwards?
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
won't
be,
if
you
have
your
way
in
this
court.
i
mean,
edwards
will
go
free,
will
he
not?
justice
rehnquist
would
you
consider
it
a
solution
of
the
case
if
the
police
got
incriminating
statements
from
three
potential
suspects
to
whom
they
had
not
read
their
miranda
rights,
and
all
of
their
declarations
were
excluded
and
the
jury
returned
verdicts
of
acquittal?
justice
rehnquist
but
doesn't
the
complaint
require
that
the
county
attorney
take
it
to
the
court
and
file
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
isn't
that
the
day
of
the
commencement?
justice
rehnquist
and
if
so,
the
complaint
had
been
filed
by
the
county
attorney
of
pima
county
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation?
justice
rehnquist
well,
has
that
superseded
entirely
the
old
procedure
where
the
defendant
after
the
warrant
of
arrest
had
been
served
on
him
could
demand
a
preliminary
hearing?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
would
be
this
type
of
case?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
didn't
happen?
justice
rehnquist
the
indictment
did
supersede?
justice
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
date
of
the
indictment?
justice
rehnquist
your
position
is
not
that
the
police
cannot
at
the
scene
of
a
crime
interrogate
witnesses
whom
they
think
might
be
guilty,
unless
each
and
every
one
of
the
witnesses
has
a
lawyer,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
so
it
depends
on
the
motive
of
the
police?
justice
rehnquist
but
will
they
ever
know
unless
they
ask?
justice
rehnquist
--in
miranda,
for
miranda
to
help
him,
he
would
have
to
be
in
custody,
would
he
not?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
mcclennen,
i'm
a
little
bit
confused
about
the
procedure
here.
on
page
30
in
the
appendix
it
simply
describes:
4,
1977>
["].
and
it
says,
"larry
bunting
was.
"
"called
as
witness
in
behalf
of
the
defendant
edwards.
"
and
then,
on
page
98,
it
says:
"proceedings,
march
28,
1977.
"
and
then,
"larry
bunting
was
thereupon
recalled
as
a
witness
in
behalf
of
the
defendant.
"
are
those
both
motions
to
suppress
in
the
superior
court?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
they
give
him
his
miranda
warnings
and
he
says,
i
want
a
lawyer,
but
before
i
get
the
lawyer,
i
want
to
tell
you
my
side
of
the
story?
justice
rehnquist
a
request
for
a
lawyer
isn't
an
automatic
refusal
to
talk
further,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
meehan,
do
you
contend
that
the
two-sentence
opinion
of
the
court
in
mcleod
extended
the
massiah
rule?
