justice
white
how
who
knew
that?
justice
white
you
are
defending
the
judgment
of
your
court
and
the
rationale
of
it?
justice
white
and
you
agree
that
your
case
depends
on
waiver?
justice
white
that
there
was
an
indication
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
silence?
justice
white
and
so
that
you
have
to
find
the
elements
of
a
waiver
thereafter?
justice
white
and
that
you
have
to
contend
there
doesn't
have
to
be
an
express
waiver?
justice
white
or
a
written
waiver,
a
fortiori?
justice
white
just
the
mere
fact
of
being
willing
to
answer
questions?
justice
white
so
suppose
a
man
in
custody
is
given
his
miranda
warnings
and
then
the
officer
just
asks
him
some
questions
and
he
answers
them.
no
question
about...
no
express
waiver,
no
written
waiver,
and
would
you
say
that
a
waiver
would
be
as
readily
implied
in
this
case
as
there?
justice
white
well,
why?
why?
justice
white
because
you're
saying
that
it's
easier
to
find
a
waiver
after
you
have
invoked
your
right
to
counsel
and
after
you've
invoked
your
right
to
silence
than
it
is
before?
justice
white
well,
is
that
true
about...
that
might
be
true
about
silence,
but
how
about
the
attorney?
you
know,
when
you
invoke
your
right
to
an
attorney
you're
in
a
sense
saying,
i'm
not
competent
to
handle
my
own
affairs.
justice
white
you
say,
silence;
maybe
you
are.
justice
white
well,
what
about
this
case?
justice
white
well,
i
know
but
your
supreme
court,
and
you're
defending
that,
said
he
invoked
his
right
to
counsel--
justice
white
--before
he
was
to
do
anything.
justice
white
all
right,
go
ahead.
so
when
he
heard
the
tape,
he
just
said
something.
is
that
it?
justice
white
yes,
but
didn't
your
supreme
court
also
recognize
that
when
the
officers
arrived
the
next
morning
and
the
jailor
said
to
him,
the
officers
are
here,
he
said,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
anyone?
and
didn't
the
jailor
say,
yes,
but
you
have
to?
justice
white
well,
that
isn't
what
had
happened.
and
your
supreme
court
recognized
that.
justice
white
and
you
recognize
it?
justice
white
how
about
your
supreme
court?
justice
white
i
just
asked
you,
how
about
your
supreme
court?
what'd
the
supreme
court?
justice
white
and...
so
that
he
was
told
that
he
had
to?
justice
white
yes,
and...
but,
nevertheless
found
a
waiver
simply
from
his
willingness
to
talk
thereafter.
justice
white
you
have
to
get
to
that,
don't
you?
yes.
do
you
say
this
is
or
is
not
a
waiver,
on
the
19th?
on
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
colloquy
on
the
bottom
of
page
71?
justice
white
so
you...
essentially
you
say
that
if
a
fellow
invokes
his
right
to
counsel
and
then
the
police
then
turn
on
a
record
and
he
listens
to
it
and
then
he
says
something,
that's
a
waiver?
justice
white
why
isn't
that
what
happened
here?
justice
white
and
your
supreme
court
recognized
that?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
he
changed
his
mind
after
the
jailor
said,
you
have
to
talk.
but
you
just
don't...
you
say
that
we
must,
or
should,
ignore
that
interchange
between
him
and
the
jailor.
justice
white
what
if
we
don't?
justice
white
well,
he
may
not
have
but
he
certainly
was
told
by
the
jailor.
justice
white
well,
what
difference
does
that
make?
he
was
told
by
an
official
that
he
had
to
talk,
so
he
came
out
and
he
said,
i'll
say
anything
you
want.
justice
white
then
your
supreme
court
would
have
concluded
that
it
was
a
voluntary
waiver?
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
all
that
happened
after
that...
supposing
they
start
interrogating,
they
give
him
his
miranda
warnings,
and
he
says,
i
want
a
lawyer.
then
they
give
him
his
miranda
warnings
again,
and
play
him
a
record.
and
he
talks.
is
that
a
waiver?
justice
white
well,
in
this
case,
they
gave
him
his
miranda
warnings
and
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer.
then
they
give
him
his
miranda
warnings
again--
justice
white
--he
says,
i'll
talk.
justice
white
well,
even
if
it
were,
do
you
say
that...
assume
that
it
was,
would
you
say
massiah
takes
over
if
an
attorney
hasn't
been
appointed
yet?
justice
white
what
case
have
you
got
for
that?
mcleod
v.
ohio.
justice
white
even
if
he
has
no
lawyer?
justice
white
and
even
if
he
can
hire
his
own
lawyer?
justice
white
it
just
reversed,
didn't
it?
justice
white
that's
correct.
and
citing
massiah.
correct.
justice
white
like
that
famous
hicks
case.
