justice
stevens
mr.
meehan:
i
didn't
understand
one
of
your
answers
to
justice
rehnquist.
supposing
you're
right
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
the
police
ask
somebody
who
was
a
suspect
a
question,
they've
let
him
know
he's
a
suspect;
he
says,
i
want
a
lawyer.
i
don't
want
to
answer
your
question.
is
it
your
view
they
can
go
ahead
and
question
him
anyway?
justice
stevens
just
the
fact
that
it's
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
doesn't
mean
he
isn't
in
custody.
they
tell
him
he's
a
suspect
and
they
give
him
the
warnings;
he
says
he
wants
a
lawyer.
as
i
understand
your
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
can
still
go
ahead
and
question
him.
is
that
really
what
you're--
justice
stevens
--but
that's
based
on
miranda,
whereas
the
facts
here
are
massiah...
ah,
sixth
amendment--
justice
stevens
mr.
meehan,
when
do
you
contend
that
the
interrogation
started?
justice
stevens
well,
specifically,
do
you
contend
that
playing
him
the
tape
of
the
other
person's
confession
was
the
commencement
of
interrogation
under
rhode
island
v.
innis?
justice
stevens
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
as
to
whether
there
was
a
waiver
at
that
point
or
later.
to
answer
the
waiver
question,
i
think
you
first
have
to
decide
when
the
interrogation
started.
justice
stevens
if
you
say
that,
then
they
have
the
burden
of
proving
waiver
before
they
started
to
play
the
tape.
justice
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
how
edwards
knew
they
had
soto's
tape?
justice
stevens
that
is,
specifically
about
the
tape.
how
did
he
know
there
was
a
tape?
justice
stevens
mr.
mcclennen,
you
indicated
a
little
while
ago
that
the
defendant
knew
what
his
right
was
after
having
requested
counsel.
justice
stevens
what
was
his
right
after
having
requested
counsel?
justice
stevens
he
didn't
get
it.
how
did
he
know
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney?
justice
stevens
you
mean
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
if
he
ever
went
to
trial,
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
the
right
to
an
attorney
at
any
particular
point
in
time?
justice
stevens
what
happens
then,
what
is
his
right?
when
he
asks
for
an
attorney,
does
that
change
the
legal
situation
at
all
and
if
so,
how?
justice
stevens
what
duty,
if
any,
does
it
impose
upon
the
police?
justice
stevens
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer.
now,
what
duty
did
that
impose
on
the
police?
justice
stevens
but
then
they
did.
justice
stevens
--at
this
point,
mr.
mcclellan,
just
so
i
understand
the
state
procedure.
i
understand
they
did
supersede
with
a
new
indictment--
justice
stevens
--but
say
they
had
not
filed
an
indictment.
would
it
have
been
permissible
without
filing
any
other
piece
of
paper
with
the
court
to
go
to
trial?
justice
stevens
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
maybe
he's
entitled
to
an
attorney
even
if
he
hasn't
been
formally
charged.
