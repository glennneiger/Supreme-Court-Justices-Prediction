mr.
crane
mcclennen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
issues,
admissibility
of
a
confession
after
a
request
for
an
attorney,
and
the
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
the
state
feels
that
there
are
several
important
facts
to
be
considered
in
this
case.
first
is,
mr.
edwards
was
warned
of
his
right
four
times.
now
there
is
fairly
considerable
disagreement
about
this,
but
sergeant
bunting,
everyone
agrees,
advised
him
twice:
once
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
and
once
on
the
tape.
detective
marmion
advised
him
of
his
rights
the
next
morning.
and
on
page
70
of
the
record
mr.
edwards
himself
says
that
officer
allen
advised
him
of
his
rights...
page
70
of
the
appendix:
"question:
at
any
time
did
sgt.
"
"bunting
or
steve
bunting,
the
other
detective,
read
you
your
miranda
rights?
"
"answer:
no.
"
"it
was
a
detective...
it
was
a
black
policeman
in
a
car.
"
"i
don't
know
his
name.
"
that
was
four
times.
on
the
night
of
january
19,
after
the
discussion,
after
the
tape
recorded
statement,
and
after
the
discussion
back
and
forth
about
the
deal,
mr.
edwards
never
said,
"i
do
not
want
to
talk
to
you
again
until
i
see
an
attorney.
"
he
never
said,
"i
will
not
answer
any
more
questions
till
i
see
an
attorney.
"
what
he
said
was,
"i
will
wait
until
i
get
an
attorney
before
i
make
a
deal.
"
"i'll
wait
till
then
before
i
make
a
statement.
"
mr.
crane
mcclennen
that's
several
pages
throughout
the
record.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
page
37,
down
towards
the
bottom:
"answer:
he
never
asked
for
an
attorney.
"
"he
stated
he
was
going
to
wait
until
he
had
an
attorney
to
make
a
deal.
"
at
the
top
of
the
page
37:
"he
was
going
to
wait
until
he
had
an
attorney
before
he
made
a
deal.
"
page
39,
the
middle
of
the
page:
"i'm
just
going
to
wait
until
i
get
an
attorney
to
make
a
deal
for
me.
"
page
41,
towards
the
top.
and
page
43,
right
before
the
cross-examination
starts:
"he.
"
"stated
that
without
a
deal
he
was
not
going
to
make
a
statement.
"
"he
would
wait
for
his
attorney
to
make
a
deal
for
him.
"
mr.
crane
mcclennen
he
never
specifically
said
that.
the
next
morning
when
detective
marmion
went
there,
detective
marmion...
page
57
of
the
appendix,
towards
the
bottom:
"answer:
i
got
there.
"
"i
identified
myself
to
mr.
barefield
as
a
homicide
detective.
"
"he
said
something
to
the
effect,
i
don't
remember
his
exact
words,
that
he
recognized
me
from
seeing
me
the
night
before
at
the
detective
division.
"
"i
told
him
i
was
the
detective
that
had
the
case
and
i
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
"
"i
then
advised
him
of
his
constitutional
rights.
"
"he
replied
that
he
would
talk
to
me
and
tell
us
anything
we
wanted
to
know,
but,
first,
he
wanted
to
hear
manny
soto's
statement.
"
and
also,
in
the
supplemental
appendix,
page
52.
this
is
detective
milne
testifying:
"answer:
detective
marmion
went
through
your
rights
rather
thoroughly
to
make
sure
you
understood
all
your
rights.
"
mr.
crane
mcclennen
he
never
said,
i
will
no
longer
wait
until
i
get
an
attorney
to
make
a
deal.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
they
advised
him
of
his
rights.
he
said,
i
understand
that
and
i'll
answer
your
questions.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
they
said,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
you
have
the
right
to
an
attorney.
he
said,
i
understand
that,
i'll
answer
your
questions.
now,
in
north
carolina
v.
butler,
it
is
said
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
specific
waiver
of
the
right
to
an
attorney.
you
must
look
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
we
submit
that
this
dialogue
where
he
was
specifically
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney.
he
said,
i
understood
that.
i'll
answer
your
questions.
that
constitutes
a
waiver.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no,
justice
rehnquist,
the
proceedings,
march
4
and
march
7,
those
are
the
proceedings
at
the
suppression
hearing.
then,
the
proceedings,
march
21
and
28,
the
latter
part
of
march,
that
is
the
first
trial,
the
one
that
ended
in
a
hung
jury
and
a
mistrial.
the
proceedings
in
april
were
the
second
trial
where
mr.
edwards
was
convicted.
now,
the
next
morning,
when
detective
marmion
went
to
visit
mr.
edwards,
the
reason
why
detective
marmion
went
to
visit
mr.
edwards,
it
was
detective
marmion's
case.
he
had
been
assigned
as
the
lead
detective
in
that
case.
it
was
his
responsibility.
the
reason
why
detective
marmion
did
not
arrest
mr.
edwards,
marmion
and
milne
were
in
the
process
of
arresting
manny
soto
while
sergeant
bunting
and
detective
bunting
and
officer
allen
were
arresting
mr.
edwards.
these
took
place
simultaneously.
marmion
and
milne
the
night
of
the
19th
were
interrogating
mr.
soto
while
sergeant
bunting
was
interrogating
mr.
edwards.
so
detective
marmion
whose
case
it
was
had
not
had
an-opportunity
to
talk
to
mr.
edwards
the
night
of
the
19th.
in
his
case,
he
was
interested
in
what
mr.
edwards
had
to
say,
so
he
went
to
the
jail
the
next
morning,
read
mr.
edwards
his
rights.
mr.
edwards
acknowledged
them,
said
he'll
answer
the
questions,
but
then
mr.
edwards
said,
but
first
i
want
to
hear
manny
soto's
tape.
detective
marmion
played
the
tape
per
mr.
edwards'
request,
and
that
caused
mr.
edwards
to
confess.
the
tape--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--nothing
says
that
that
caused
him
to
confess.
but
they
played
the
tape--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--that's
my
conclusion.
they
played
the
tape
and
immediately
he
says,
all
right,
i'll
give
you
my
story.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no.
that's
unclear.
he
knew
on
the
night
of
the
19th
that
mr.
soto
was
being
interrogated
but
mr.
edwards
was
not
told.
he
was
told
that
soto
was
confessing
but
he
was
not
told
what
he
was
saying.
so
mr.
edwards
the
night
of
the
19th
did
not
know
exactly
what
mr.
soto
had
said.
he
did
not
know
that
until
the
morning
of
the
20th.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
how
he
knew
that.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
mr.
edwards
knew
that
there
was
a
tape.
our
position
in
this
matter
is--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--according
to
the
record
it
was
immediately
after
that.
he
heard
the
tape--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--i'm
not
sure
where
in
the
record
it
says
that
after
he
heard
the
tape
he
said,
all
right,
i'll
make
a
statement.
it's
somewhere,
but
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it
right
now.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes,
insofar
as
it
allows
the
police
to
reinterrogate
someone
who
has
asked
for
counsel.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
when
he
said,
i'll
wait
till
i
get
an
attorney
to
make
a
deal,
i'll
wait
till
then.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
or
a
written
waiver
under--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--in
this
situation,
yes,
where
he
was
told
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney,
he
knew
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney,
he
knew
if
he
asked
for
an
attorney
that
they
would
stop
talking--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--i
think
in
your
hypothetical
you
might
have
a
more
difficult
time
finding
a
waiver
than
we
do
have--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--well--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--you
can
make
the
argument
that
once
you've
invoked
it,
you
know
that
you
have
it,
that
clearly
indicates
within
the
person's
mind
that
he
has
those
rights
and
what
will
happen
if
he
invokes
them.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
maybe.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
that's
the
argument
that's
made,
that
when
a
person
says,
i
wish
to
remain
silent,
that
he
is
controlling
his
own
destiny.
but
if
he
says,
i
want
an
attorney,
it
indicates
that
he
is
acknowledging
he
is
incapable.
but
i
do
not
think
that
that's
true
in
all
cases.
and
if
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
situation,
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
can
hear
the
person's
testimony
and
if
at
the
motion
to
suppress
the
man
says,
yes,
i
asked
for
an
attorney
because
i
knew
that
i
couldn't
handle
matters
with
the
police,
it's
true
in
that
situation.
if
you
get
another
man
that
says,
i
just
asked
for
an
attorney
because
i
thought--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--in
this
case
he
said
he'd
wait
till
he
had
an
attorney
before
he
made
a
deal,
and
then
when
he
heard
the
tape--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
first,
they
read
him
his
rights.
and
he
said,
all
right,
i'll
answer
your
questions.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
the
supreme
court
may
have
recognized
that
but
it--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--i
don't
recognize
that;
the
trial
court
didn't
recognize
that,
because
if
that
in
fact
happened,
that
would
indicate
it's
involuntary
and
the
trial
court
specifically
ruled
that
it
did
not
believe
mr.
edwards'
testimony.
and
it
found
that
the
confession--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--well,
this
court
can
look
at
the
same
facts--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--the
supreme
court
did
point
out
that
fact.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
they
quoted
from
the
record.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
in
this
case
the
police--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--no.
in
this
case
it's
not
that
he
just
talks.
the
police
read
him
his
rights
and
he
says,
all
right,
i'll
answer
your
questions.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
maybe
that's
a
waiver,
but
that's
not
what
you
have
here.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
not
for
the
statement
on
the
20th.
that
preceded
the
tape
recorded
statement
on
the
19th.
the
waiver
on
the
20th--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
waiver.
but
nobody's
challenging
the
admissibility
of
the
statement
on
the
19th.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
it
indicates
that
he
understands
his
rights.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
would
be
a
waiver
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
because
what
happened
here
is,
he
asked
for
counsel,
and
he
was
sent
back
to
the
jail.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
the
next
morning
the
police
came.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
the
officer
introduced
himself.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
read
him
his
rights.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
"he
replied
that
he
would
talk
to
me,
and
tell
us
anything
we
wanted
to
know.
"
"but
first
he
wanted
to
hear
manny
soto's
statement.
"
he
says
that
he'll
talk
to
them.
if
an
officer
reads
a
suspect
his
rights,
he
says,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
you
have
the
right
to
an
attorney,
you
understand
that?
yes;
i'll
talk
to
you.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no,
he
said
i'll
wait
till
i
get
an
attorney
before
i'll
make
a
deal,
before
i
make
a
statement.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
our
position
is
that
he
changed
his
mind.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
what
happens
then...
of
course,
mr.
edwards,
when
he
testified,
said
he
told
the
detectives
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
them
and
the
detectives
said
he
never
said
that.
and
the
judge
believed
the
detectives,
believed
that
edwards
never
told
the
detectives--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--yes,
but
the
jailor
never
conveyed
that
to
the
detectives.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
the
detectives
then
tell
him
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent.
and
the
trial
court
believes
that
the
testimony
was
voluntary;
if
the
trial
court
believes
that
he
had
told
the
jailor,
i'm
not
going
to
talk
to
anybody--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
did
what?
mr.
crane
mcclennen
the
jailor
was
never
called
to
testify.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
there
is
no
reason
in
the
record
indicated.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
because
that
morning
the
officers
again
told
him
of
his
rights,
specifically
told
him
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no,
they
told
him--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--they
told
him...
again
they
read
the
rights.
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
you
have
the
right
to
an
attorney.
you
have
the
right
to
an
attorney
with
you
right
now.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
it's
our
position--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--if
he
says--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--they
cannot
question
him
further--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--unless
he
changes
his
mind.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
it
might
be.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
and
he
says,
i'll
answer
your
questions.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
but
first
i
want
to
hear
the
tape.
and
they
accommodate
him.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
then
that
would
be
a
selective
waiver
which
would
allow
him
to
tell
them
his
side
of
the
story.
it's
up
to
him
to
decide
what
he
wants
to
do.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
this
court
has
said
in
fare
v.
michael
c.
that
the
request
for
an
attorney
is
a
per
se
indication
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent.
it's
our
position
that
if
a
person
could
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
if
you
can
later
withdraw
it,
as
in
michigan
v.
mosley,
if
the
request
for
an
attorney
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
he
can
again
withdraw
that,
as
the
cases
we've
cited
have
said...
united
states
v.
rodriguez-gastelum,
white
v.
finkbeiner,
u.s.
v.
hauck.
in
rodriguez-gastelum
they
said,
do
you
want
to
talk?
the
man
said,
yes,
but
with
an
attorney.
the
policeman
didn't
stop;
he
said,
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
without
an
attorney?
the
man
said,
all
right.
the
9th
circuit
said,
that's
all
right.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
said
what?
mr.
crane
mcclennen
there's
nothing
where
he
specifically
says,
all
right,
i
will
talk
to
you
without
an
attorney.
but
they
tell
him
he
specifically
has
the
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
i
guess
the
man--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--that
assumes
that
he
can
never
again
change
his
mind.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
what
if
he's--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--right.
but
that's
not
rodriguez-gastelum.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
yes.
at
any
rate,
the
cases
we
have
cited
that
i
have
mentioned
say
that
once
the
person
has
asked
for
an
attorney,
he
can
go
back
and
question
him
before
he
has
seen
an
attorney.
so,
our
position,
that's
what
happened
here.
he
knew
he
had
an
attorney,
he
was
told
again,
and
because
they
read
him
a
statement,
soto's
statement,
he
decided
he
might
as
well
talk.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
we've
reconsidered
our
position
on
that.
now,
this
court,
in
moore
v.
illinois,
said
that
the
right
to
counsel
begins
when
adversary
judicial
criminal
proceedings
are
initiated.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
well,
in
kirby
v.
illinois,
there
was
one
point
it
said,
"adversary
judicial
proceedings"...
and
then
it
said,
"adversary
judicial
criminal
proceedings".
and
then
it
said
"judicial
criminal
proceedings".
and
in
moore
v.
illinois,
in
five
places
it
said,
"adversary
judicial
criminal
proceedings".
it
happens
that
the
complaint
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
a
policeman
can
file
a
complaint,
a
citizen
off
the
street
can
file
a
complaint--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--well,
i
conceded
that
the
state
had
filed
a
complaint.
but
the
question
is,
does
that
begin
the
adversary
judicial
criminal
proceedings?
mr.
crane
mcclennen
in
our
supplemental
brief
we
reconsidered
our
position.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
it
never
said
anything
on
that
issue,
and
another
matter
is
that
at
the
motion
to
suppress
it
was
never
argued
that
the
confession
should
have
been
suppressed
because
the
sixth
amendment
had
started.
that
issue
sort
of
cropped
up
as
this
came
along.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no.
under
the
arizona
constitution
article
20,
subsection
30,
"no
person
shall
be
prosecuted
criminally
in
any
court
of
record
for
felony
or
misdemeanor
otherwise
than
by
information
or
indictment.
"
so
the
state
must
either
get
a
supervening
indictment
or
take
the
person
to
a
preliminary
hearing
and
if
he
is
bound
over
to
superior
court,
file
an
information.
the
state
cannot
proceed
on
a
complaint
alone.
it's
our
position
that
the
complaint
is
not
the
adversary
proceedings.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
no,
it's
our
position--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--no.
but
we
are
trying
to
establish
what
the
law
is
right
now.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
right,
under
miranda
he's
entitled
to
an
attorney.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
yes.
what's
interesting
in
miranda,
at
page
469,
the
court
says,
"you
must
tell
him
that
what
he
says
can
be
used
against
him
because
he's
faced
with
a
phase
of
the
adversary
system.
"
and
at
page
477,
it
again
says,
"it
is
at
this
point
that
our
adversary
system
of
criminal
procedure
commences.
"
now,
that's
under
miranda.
but
it's
our
position
that
the
filing
of
the
complaint
does
not
begin
the
adversary
judicial
criminal
proceedings
for
the
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment.
it's
not
an
adversary
proceeding.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
attorney
is
appointed.
once--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--mcleod
v.
ohio.
that
once
the
adversary
judicial
criminal
proceedings
begin,
he's
entitled
to
an
attorney
under
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
right.
mr.
crane
mcclennen
right.
however,
in
this
case,
we
contend
they
didn't
start
then.
it's
also
our
position,
even
if
they
did
start,
he
waived
them.
because
he
knew
he
was
charged
with
a
crime.
they
showed
him
a
copy
of
the
arrest
warrant.
sergeant
bunting
discussed
the
charges
with
him...
mr.
edwards,
on
page
101
and
102
of
the
brief...
"i
advised
him
of
the
charge
and
showed
him
a
copy
of
the
warrant.
"
and
at
page
104:
"question:
did
you
have
any
other
conversations
+..?
"
he
knew
that
he
was
charged
with
a
crime,
he
knew
that
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney;
he
had
previously
been
convicted
after
a
plea
of
armed
robbery,
he
had
previously
been
tried
and
acquitted
of
attempted
assault
on
a
mailman.
at
this
case
he
defended
himself.
he
wanted
to
defend
himself.
he
knew--
mr.
crane
mcclennen
--he
knew
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney,
and
in
this
case
he
waived
it.
we
therefore
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
court.
