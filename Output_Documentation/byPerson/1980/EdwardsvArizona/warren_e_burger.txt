chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
edwards
v.
arizona.
mr.
meehan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
forever
after
he
would
be...
that
no
statement
would
be
admissible?
chief
justice
burger
well,
that's
what
i
had
in
mind.
chief
justice
burger
so
your
position
is,
he
could
change
his
mind
and
agree
to
speak?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case,
now.
chief
justice
burger
i'm
talking
about
trying
to
discern
your
position.
chief
justice
burger
this
wasn't
a
hearing
where
he
was
present,
was
it?
chief
justice
burger
before
the
magistrate.
chief
justice
burger
under
the
arizona
practice,
at
what
point
after
the
complaint
is
presented
to
the
magistrate
and
presumably
filed
is
the
defendant,
the
person
in
custody,
informed
of
that
fact?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
did
he
get
this
notice
on
the
20th?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
meehan.
mr.
mcclennen.
chief
justice
burger
where
do
you
find
that
particular
dialogue?
is
that
70-71?
chief
justice
burger
how
soon
after
he
heard
that
tape
did
he
begin
to
talk
and
make
these
statements?
chief
justice
burger
did
he...
what
statement
did
he
make
to
introduce
his
statement
after
he
heard
the
tape
recording
of
the
accomplice?
chief
justice
burger
let's
turn
to
page
71
of
your
appendix,
at
the
bottom
of
71
he
said,
"well,
i
need
a
lawyer.
"
and
then
i'll
read
his
statement:
he...
this
is
edwards
speaking...
said,
"i
don't
have
nothing
to
hide
and
i'll
tell
you
my
side
of
the
story.
"
"question:
you
gave
him
a
statement.
"
and
so
forth.
do
you
rely
on
that
colloquy
as
the
waiver,
after
having
just
said,
i
want
a
lawyer?
and
then,
he
said,
is
that
language
what
you
rely
on
to
make
the
waiver?
chief
justice
burger
but
do
you
suggest
it
has
no
relation
to
what
happened
on
the
20th?
chief
justice
burger
and
that
he
wants
to
talk
to
you.
do
you
say
it
indicates
he
wants
to
talk
to
the
police?
chief
justice
burger
that
on
the
20th
he
put
the
condition
that
he
did
not
want
it
recorded?
chief
justice
burger
what
did
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
indicate
about--
chief
justice
burger
custody
is
the
fulcrum
of
miranda,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
not
charge.
well,
but
charge
is
the
fulcrum
of
massiah,
and
both
arguments
are
made
in
this
case,
and
it's
important
to
distinguish
the
two,
because
they
do
factually
run
into
each
other,
but
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
they're
quite
distinct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
mcclennen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
meehan?
chief
justice
burger
or
it
may
have
decided
that
it
wasn't
relevant.
well,
with
a
concession
by
the
state
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
that
he
had
been
formally
charged
with
an
offense,
i
would
think
that--
--if
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
conscious
of
the
law
that
your
friend
has
just
mentioned
that
the
complaint
does
not
formally
commence
the
proceeding,
then
the
arizona
supreme
court
may
have
concluded
that
that
was
the
law
without
discussing
it.
chief
justice
burger
what
date
was
that?
chief
justice
burger
but
what
date?
chief
justice
burger
i
thought
he
was
reading
from
either
a
statute
or
the
constitution
that
the
criminal
proceeding
is,
must
be,
commenced
by
either
the
information
or
an
indictment.
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
was
he
reading
from,
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
that
tell
us?
i
see
you
have
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
