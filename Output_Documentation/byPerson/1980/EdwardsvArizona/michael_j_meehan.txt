mr.
michael
j.
meehan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
which
affirmed
a
conviction
of
petitioner
edwards
which
included
the
use
of
incriminating
testimony
given
by
him
to
police
officers
at
an
interrogation
just
before
he
was
to
be
given
appointive
counsel
at
his
first
court
appearance.
the
offenses
arise
from
a
robbery
of
a
bar
in
tucson,
arizona,
in
october
of
1974.
the
case
went
unsolved
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
but
ultimately
by
gaining
confessions
from
two
accomplices
the
police
solved
the
case
sometime
before
january
19,
1976,
about
15
months
after
the
offenses.
at
that
point
the
police
obtained
a
complaint
from
a
magistrate
to
determine
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
had
been
committed,
who
issued
an
arrest
warrant
for
robert
edwards.
the
police
then
went
to
a
slum
area
of
tucson
and
arrested
edwards,
who
then
was
young
and
indigent,
and
took
him
to
the
tucson
police
department.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
he
was
23
at
that
time,
your
honor.
he
was
24
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
which
was
more
than
a
year
later.
at
the
police
department
he
was
read
his
miranda
rights,
which
he
said
he
understood.
he
gave
a
recorded
statement
at
the
tucson
police
department,
when
interrogated
by
a
police
detective
named
bunting.
at
that
time
his
statement
was
denying
any
implication
in
the
offense.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
he
had
been
formally
charged,
we
contend,
and
the
state
had
agreed
with
us
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
your
honor,
they
did
until
a
week
ago
today
when
they
filed
a
supplemental
brief.
but
in
their
brief
they
very
expressly,
in
that
portion
of
the
argument,
agreed
that
he
had
been
formally
charged.
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
agreed
in
the
statement
their
question
presented.
after
the
tape
recording
of
the
statement,
edwards
and
detective
bunting
had
an
exchange
back
and
forth
about
whether
he
would
make
a
further
statement.
he
apparently
tried
to
convince
the
police
that
they
should
talk
with
him
about
some
kind
of
a
deal.
the
police
said
that
they
would
give
him
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
but
they
would
not
entertain
any
kind
of
deal.
ultimately,
edwards
was
taken
for
holding
overnight
at
the
pima
county
jail
after
he
told
detective
bunting
in
words
to
the
effect:
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
statement
now,
i'm
not
going
to
make
a
deal
now,
i'm
going
to
wait
until
i
get
my
attorney.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think
that
1:30
when
he
was
given
a
first
arraignment,
or
possibly
if
he
had,
of
his
own,
changed
his
mind
and
decided
that
he
wanted
to
talk
further
with
the
police;
yes,
he
should
not
have
been
interrogated
without--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--my
position
is
that
under
the
right
circumstances
i
think
he
might
be
able
to
change
his
mind.
i
say
that
that
is
not
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
understand.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
my
position
is
that
in
terms
of
application
of
miranda,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
unless
truly
the
accused
himself
institutes
a
change
of
mind,
that
there
should
be
no
reinterrogation
until
counsel
has
a
chance
to
confer
with
the
accused
who
has
asked
for
it.
this
court
made
very
clear,
i
think,
in
miranda,
that
that
situation,
where
an
accused
asks
for
a
lawyer,
should
be
treated
differently
from
the
situation
where
the
accused
simply
listens
to
the
rights
and
then
goes
ahead
and
speaks
or
even
listens
to
the
rights
being
read
to
him
and
decides
to
remain
silent,
which
indicates
that
he
is
feeling
capable
of
making
his
own
decisions
about
whether
to
deal
with
the
interrogating
officers
or
not
to
deal
with
them.
it
was
said
in
miranda
and
this
court
confirmed
in
a
majority
and
concurring
opinions
in
mosley,
and
in
innis,
and
in
fare
v.
michael
c.,
that
miranda
meant
what
it
said;
that
unless...
at
least
as
far
as
the
police
reinterrogation...
once
the
accused
has
been
read
his
miranda
rights
and
says
he'd
like
to
have
a
lawyer,
that
there
shall
be
no
reinterrogation
until
a
lawyer
is
provided.
this
case
demonstrates,
i
think,
why
that
often
is
no
great
burden,
because
there
was
no
reason
that
the
interrogation
couldn't
have
been
carried
out
after
1:30
on
the
20th
of
january.
instead
it
was
carried
out
on
the
morning
of
20
january,
hours
before
edwards
would
be
making
his
first
appearance
and
at
a
time
when
the
police
were
aware
that
edwards
as
an
indigent
would
be
appointed
counsel
that
afternoon.
they
knew
that
he
was
about
to
get
a
lawyer.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
that's
true,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and,
indeed,
in
miranda,
what
was
said
was,
we're
not
holding
that
the
police
have
to
have
a
lawyer
in
every
precinct.
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
two
things
about
this
case.
one,
the
case
was
solved.
they
were
not
looking
for
additional
offenders,
they
were
not
further
investigating
the
case,
they
were
not
looking
for
the
fruits
or
the
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
such
as
may
have
been
a
justification
in
innis
had
that
been
held
to
have
been
an
interrogation,
they
were
not
trying
to
locate
the
body
as
was
the
case
in
brewer
v.
williams,
there
was
no
urgency.
and
even
under
miranda
it
seems
to
me,
once
the
accused
says,
i
would
like
a
lawyer,
he's
indicating
that
he
feels
that
he
needs
to
have
that
help,
he
needs
to
have
somebody
with
him;
he's
acknowledging
that
the
inherent
coercive
atmosphere,
custodial
interrogation,
which
is
the
focus
of
the
miranda
guarantee,
and
the
reason
for
the
warnings
and
affording
the
right
to
counsel
is
affecting
him.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think
that's
an
assumption
that
can't
be
made
at
this
point,
because
at
the
trial
the
evidence
included
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers,
but
also
testimony
of
an
accomplice
named
cleveland
reed.
there
was
also
obtained,
and
before
this
interrogation
of
edwards,
a
tape-recorded
confession
of
another
accomplice
named
soto.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
tape
recorded
confession
had
been
played,
several
minutes
of
it,
at
least,
for
edwards
on
the
morning
of
his
interrogation,
which
prompted
the
admissions
that
are
the
subject
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think
i
would
treat
it
as
having
been
solved
by
virtue
of
what
the
police
felt
at
the
time
that
they
undertook
the
interrogation,
and
i
think,
number
one,
it
would
be
somewhat
unrealistic
to
have
a
set
of
facts
in
which
there
were
three
different
statements
without
miranda
rights
having
been
read
to
them.
but
secondly,
it
seems
to
me
the
focus
has
to
be
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
what
was
the
motive
of
the
police
in
undertaking
this
interrogation?
at
that
time
the
offense
was
old,
they
were
not,
you
know,
on
the
trail
of
additional
accomplices.
they
felt,
as
the
state
said
in
its
opener,
its
responsor
brief,
they
felt
they
had
enough
evidence.
that's
exactly
what
the
state
said
in
its
brief,
and
they
did.
and
they
presented
it
to
a
magistrate,
and
a
magistrate
then
has
the
right
and
the
obligation
to
weigh
that
evidence,
to
cross-examine
the
complaining
officer,
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
was
committed,
and
the
defendant
committed
it,
and
if
so
to
in
effect
file
the
complaint,
which
is
to
say,
to
approve
the
complaint
and
then
to
issue
the
arrest
warrant.
there
are,
of
course,
two
issues
presented
in
this
case,
one
under
miranda
and
one
under
the
sixth
amendment.
because
the
state
has
recently
chosen
to
argue
that
no
formal
prosecution
had
begun
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
spend
more
time
talking
about
the
sixth
amendment
aspects
of
it
than
the
miranda
aspects.
as
i
said,
in
the
courts
below
and
in
its
briefs
in
this
court,
except
the
supplemental
brief,
the
state
has
agreed
with
the
petitioner
that
at
the
time
of
this
interrogation
formal
prosecution
had
begun
and
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment
as
a
critical
stage
had
arisen.
a
week
ago
the
state
contended
on
the
virtue
of
a
second
circuit
case
construing
federal
criminal
rules
of
procedure
that
no
formal
prosecution
had
begun.
i
think
the
state
was
correct
in
its
first
position.
in
arizona,
under
the
criminal
rules,
prosecution
may
be
commenced
in
two
ways,
either
by
indictment
or
by
complaint.
in
this
case
prosecution
was
commenced
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
the
complaint
is
presented
to
a
magistrate
and
it
is
in
effect
filed.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
that
is
the
day
of
the
commencement,
but
in
this
case
the
complaint
was
filed
on
the
19th
of
january.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes,
your
honor,
it
had
been
filed
with
the
magistrate.
now,
in
arizona
the
probable
cause
proceedings
and
the
complaint
are
begun
before
a
magistrate,
which
typically
is
a
police
court
or
a
justice
court,
as
it
is
in
arizona.
and
ultimately,
those
documents
are
then
filed
in
the
prosecution
file
in
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
superior
court.
and
that
filing
did
occur
somewhat
after
the
day
of
the
interrogation.
but
in
terms
of
the
magistrate
receiving
the
complaint
and
having
the
officer
appear
before
him
and
taking
sworn
testimony
if
he
chooses
to
do
so,
and
so
forth,
this
was
done
on
the
19th
of
january.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
it's
footnote
47
on
page
24.
the
respondent
recognizes
the
efficacy
of
massiah
and
also
cites
without
dispute
the
mcleod
case
of
this
court,
which
was
handed
down
very
shortly
after
massiah
and
which
i
think
supports
the
position
that
we
have
here
that
it's
not
important
that
this
interrogation
was
carried
out
just
before
the
appointment
of
counsel
rather
than
just
after,
because
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
vacating
what
the
ohio
courts
had
done
in
mcleod.
that
distinction,
i
think,
is
clearly
not
important.
i
would
say
that
the
distinction
is
important
in
terms
of
the
due
process
argument
that
we
make,
and
also
in
terms
of
the
motivation
of
the
interrogating
officers
at
this
point.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
knowing
that
the
petitioner
would
have
counsel
appointed
for
him
that
afternoon
and
knowing
that
any
counsel
worth
his
salt
is
going
to
fully
apprise
this
defendant
of
what
he
is
charged
with
and
what
the
severity
of
the
charges
are
and
what
the
police
can
do
with
a
statement
and
so
forth
is
going
to
advise
this
defendant,
not
now
to
try
quickly
to
make
a
deal
by
giving
a
statement
or
to
make
a
statement
at
all.
and
of
course,
that's
something
that
is
to
me,
and--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
cannot
tell
this
court
that
there
was
a
proceeding
in
terms
of
anything
more
than
the
officer
preparing
the
complaint
and
swearing
to
it
and
appearing
with
the
complaint
before
the
magistrate.
i
am--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--well,
he...
edwards?
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
no.
it
was
not...
it
is
an
ex
parte
hearing.
arizona
has
kind
of
a
strange
term
for
it.
we
used
to
call
it
"a
one-man
grand
jury"
because
it
can
be
a
very
full-blown
hearing
or
it
can
be
a
very
perfunctory
hearing
in
which
the
magistrate
having
placed
before
him
a
rather
routine
felony
complaint
and
having
no
basis
to
disagree
with
what's
sworn
to
by
the
officer
simply
says,
yes,
and,
i'll
issue
the
complaint.
as
an
example,
one
of
the
other
ways
that
this
rule
has
been
used
in
times
before
the
middle
70s
when
arizona
began
to
use
grand
juries
with
regularity,
the
so-called
one-man
grand
jury
was
used
to
investigate
corruption
in
public
office.
we
had
a
sheriff
in
pima
county
who
was
rather
famous,
indeed,
i
would
say,
notorious,
whose
prosecution
was
originally
begun
with
the
earlier
procedural
equivalent
of
this
rule
2.2,
2.3,
and
2.4
procedure.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
preliminary
hearing
still
exists
for
those
felony
prosecutions
that
are
commenced
by
complaint.
i
think
it's
significant,
however--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--except
that
there
is
now,
because
of
the
more
common
use
of
grand
juries
and
the
desire
not
to
get
involved
with
public
preliminary
hearings
at
which
the
accused
is
present,
a
possibility
of
a
complaint
beginning
a
case
and
then
an
indictment
superseding
the
complaint.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
that
did
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
the
indictment
did
supersede.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i'm
not
sure,
that
it
was
the
27th
or
so
of
january.
it
was
fairly
shortly
after,
but
it
was
after
the
interrogation.
i
should
point
out
one
problem
with
getting
into
this
area
of
formal
prosecution.
edwards
was
arrested
in
1976.
he
was
not
tried
until
april
of
1977,
and
in
the
interim
the
charges
against
him
were
dismissed
because
of
procedural
problems
not
germane
to
the
confession.
when
the
case
went
up
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
we
briefed
and
argued
this
matter,
a
speedy
trial
and
other
things,
and
pointed
out
that
only
the
second
court's
file
went
up
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
and
said
that
we
would
move
to
amend
or
supplement
the
record
if
necessary.
the
state
agreed
with
us
in
their
briefs
before
the
supreme
court
as
to
the
sequence
of
events,
and
they
agreed
with
us
here
as
to
the
sequence
of
events.
so,
physically
speaking,
the
papers
on
the
indictment
from
the
first
case
and
the
complaint
are
not
within
this
court's
record,
but
i
can
ask
the
clerk
to
supplement
that
if
that
becomes
necessary
or
appropriate.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
no,
indeed.
but
that's
investigative
interrogation
and
quite
different,
i
think,
from
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
not
motive
entirely.
i
think
motive
is
important
in
deciding
what
is
appropriate
and
what
is
not
appropriate.
i
think
that
motive
is
important
here
because,
number
one,
there
are
no
countervailing
considerations
to
require
prompt
interrogation.
if
there
were
some
other
problem,
if
the
body
of
the
murder
victim
were
still
to
be
located
or
if
there
may
be
other
persons
who
were
involved
and
should
be
identified,
or
if
there
was
a
dangerous
weapon
like
in
innis,
and
there
was
a
need
right
now
to
see
whether
this
defendant
would
waive
his
rights
and
answer
questions
so
that
those
other
investigative
activities
quite
properly
undertaken
could
be
furthered,
maybe
the
interrogation
should
occur
right
away.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
well,
i
think
that
the
situations
themselves
are
going
to
be
fairly
easily
divisible
into
categories
and
of
course
one
reason
i
think
this
situation
is
fairly
easily
divisible
into
the
category
that
i'm
describing
is
the
fact
of
the
complaint,
and
the
police
believing
that,
they'd
been
working
on
the
case
for
15
months,
they
believe
now
they've
got
enough,
they've
gotten
two
statements,
the
time
between
the
offense
and
the
arrest,
and
so
forth,
i
think
simply
tells
them
at
that
time
and
tells
this
court
at
this
time
that
we're
dealing
with
a
post-complaint,
a
post-indictment...
to
use
a
shorthand
term...
interrogation.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
would
say
that
if
the
suspect
is
in
custody
it
would
be
a
consideration.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
didn't
mean
to
leave
that
impression.
again,
i
was
speaking
more
to
the
sixth
amendment
issue
than
to
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
that
unless
this
court
is
going
to
change
what
i
believe
has
been
clearly
stated
in
miranda
and
the
other
cases
that
you're
bringing
out
that
at
that
point
the
police
have
to
scrupulously
honor
that
request
and
not
reinterrogate
until
a
lawyer
is
provided.
at
that
point--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
think
that
this
is
more
a
sixth
amendment,
massiah...
or
really,
a
brewer
type
of
case
than
it
is
a
miranda
type
of
case,
although
obviously
the
two
really
come
very
close
together.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
whereas,
with
the
sixth
amendment
custody
isn't
important
but
may
exist
here.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i'm
not
sure,
except
i
know
that
at
the
initial
appearance
which
was
the
proceeding
that
was
to
have
taken
place
on
the
20th,
one
of
the
functions
is
to
either
read
to
or
provide
a
copy
of
the
complaint
which
is
referred
to
as
the
formal
charges,
and
to
advise
of
rights
and
so
forth.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
the
record
indicates
that
he
was
shown
a
copy
of
the
arrest
warrant
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
on
the
19th,
shown
in
the
sense,
i
am
sure,
of
not
handing
it
to
him
to
read
but
to
support
the
arrest,
because
there
is
an
indication
that
there
was
a
scuffle
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
he
was
told
generally
that
he
was
an
accused
in
a
murder
case
on
the
19th
when
he
was
interrogated
by
sergeant
bunting
at
the
tucson
police
department.
in
terms
of
explaining
to
him
precisely
what
the
charges
were,
precisely
what
the
penalties
were,
precisely
where
they
were
in
stage
of
proceedings
and
so
forth,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he
was
given
that
information
at
any
time
before
he
made
the
statement
on
the
morning
of
the
20th
that,
i'll
tell
you...
i'll
talk
with
you,
but
i
don't
want
anything
tape
recorded
because
i
don't
want
it
used
against
me
in
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
must
argue,
and
obviously
does
argue,
that
edwards'
sixth
amendment
right
was
waived,
and
the
question
then
becomes
whether
in
fact
a
waiver
can
occur
of
that
right
and
whether
it
can
be
supported
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
brewer
v.
williams
is
the
closest
that
this
court
has
come
to
finding
what
will
support
a
waiver
in
a
sixth
amendment
as
opposed
to
a
miranda
or
a
fifth
amendment
kind
of
a
case.
brewer
did
not,
however,
reach
what
would
be
sufficient.
all
other
waivers
of
trial
rights,
rights
like
the
right
to
counsel,
which
involved
the
factfinding
process,
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
and
the
reliability
of
the
trial,
have
always
been
required
to
be
made
in
open
court
and
approved
and
supervised
by
a
trial
judge,
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
this
court
has
said
in
in
the
schneckloth
case
that
the
high
standard
of
waiver
which
i
think
applies
in
the
sixth
amendment
kinds
of
cases
requires
a
showing
of
knowledge,
understanding,
and
voluntary
relinquishment
that
can
only,
or
at
least
is
designed
to
be
carried
out
in
that
kind
of
a
setting.
i
submit
that
in
the
case
that's
before
the
court,
there
is
no
justification
for
finding
a
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
it's
possible
that
in
order
to
establish
the
very
high
standard
that
this
court
has
imposed
by
johnson
v.
zerbst
and
by
fare
v.
michael
c.,
and
by
at
least
in
dictum
schneckloth,
and
faretta
v.
california
for
waiver
of
right
to
counsel
at
a
critical
stage,
that
a
waiver
should
be
either
conducted
before
a
magistrate
or
a
judge
in
open
court
so
that
the
record
can
be
made
that
should
be
made.
or
that
it
cannot
be
accepted
unless
counsel
has
had
a
chance
to
consult
and
advise
the
client,
or
at
the
very
least,
that
it
be
an
express
waiver
of
a
kind
that
would
provide
independent
evidence.
and
i
say,
independent
from
the
testimony
of
those
who
really
have
an
interest
in
establishing
a
waiver,
a
videotape,
an
audio
tape,
or
even
a
written
waiver.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
court
needs
to
accept
or
reject
any
one
of
the
three
or
that
even
any
one
of
the
three
necessarily
have
to
be
exclusive,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cases
of
this
court
impose
a
very
high
standard
of
joined
waiver
and
that
in
order
to
fulfill
that
some
kind
of
quite
reliable
factfinding
process
needs
to
be
undertaken
before
there
can
be
a
waiver.
in
this
case,
what
do
we
have
that
would
establish
a
waiver?
number
one,
when
the
police
went
to
the
jail
on
the
morning
of
the
20th
to
interrogate
edwards,
he
said
he
didn't
want
to
talk
to
them.
he
told
the
detention
officer
he
didn't
want
to
come
out
of
"the
hole",
as
he
described
it.
number
two,
after
he
was
given
his
miranda
rights
and
was
read
a
tape
recording
of
another
accomplice,
he
made
the
very
conflicting
statement,
i'll
tell
you
what
you
want
to
hear,
but
i
don't
want
it
recorded
because
i
don't
want
it
used
against
me
in
court.
the
police
said,
big
deal.
there
are
two
of
us
here;
we
can
testify
to
what
you
say.
he
didn't
say,
oh,
okay.
he
said,
i
don't
want
it
used
against
me
in
court
so
i
don't
want
it
tape
recorded.
and
finally,
he
did
not
say
anything
about
giving
up
his
right
to
counsel.
he
didn't
say,
well,
i
wanted
a
lawyer
yesterday
but
today
i
feel
more
able
to
deal
for
myself
and
so
i
don't
want
one
today.
under
these
facts,
it
seems
to
me
there
can
be
no
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
haven't
focused
on
it
that
clearly,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
after
edwards
was
brought
into
the
interview
or
interrogation
room
at
the
jail.
they
read
him
his
rights,
they
said
they
wanted
to
talk
with
him.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes,
i
think
it
was,
because
i
think
it
was
done--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--that
statement
supposes
that
by
listening
to
the
tape
and
making
a
judgment
as
to
the
efficacy
of
that
tape
in
being
able
to
convict
edwards
that
he
then
was
more
informed
in
terms
of
his
need
for
counsel,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
playing
of
the
tape
was
designed
to
get
edwards
to
talk.
they
were
telling
him
how
everybody
else
was--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--yes,
that's
true,
that
is
true.
and
that
then
eliminates
the
conflicting
statements
that
were
made
after
the
tape
was
played.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
one
or
two
items,
if
i
may.
the
section
of
the
record
that
you're
inquiring
about
which
i
think
most
clearly
expresses
edwards's
statement
in
asking
for
a
lawyer
is
on
page
151.
now,
that
may
be
moot
because
the
state--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--of
the
appendix.
that
may
be
moot
because
the
state
has
agreed
with
me
that
on
the
19th,
as
the
trial
court
found
and
as
the
arizona
supreme
court
found,
he
had
asked
for
a
lawyer.
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn't
speak
to
the
commencement
of
formal
prosecution
because
of
the
concession,
obviously.
i
would
point
out
that
the
information
there--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--they
did
not,
your
honor,
although--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--that's
correct.
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
not
carefully
and
thoroughly
briefed
by
both
sides
under
the
massiah
line
of
cases.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
that's
true,
but
the
question--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
i
would
acknowledge
that
that
is
conceivable
but
i
think
that
counsel
does
not
accurately
state
the
law
because
the
filing
of
the
information
follows,
for
example,
the
preliminary
hearing
at
which
counsel
as
well
as
the
client
has
to
waive.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
the
information,
your
honor,
was
not
filed
in
this
case.
there
was
a
supervening
indictment...
superseding
indictment.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
on
the
27th
or
so
of
january.
it
was--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--if
the
court
please,
the
constitutional
provision
does
not
say
it
must
be
commenced
that
way.
it
says
that--
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
--article
ii,
section
30,
of
the
arizona
constitution.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
otherwise
than
by.
now,
the
arizona
rules
say,
for
example,
that
at
the
first
appearance
that
edwards
made
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
he
was
interrogated
that
one
of
the
things
the
court
can
do
is
to
amend
the
formal
charges
if
necessary;
the
formal
charges.
and
the
information
and
the
indictment
both
come
at
a
time
after,
by
various
rules,
the
court
of
arizona
in
its
adopting
the
rules
has
recognized
that
the
right
to
counsel
applies.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
originally
had
been
vacated
and
remanded
because
of
massiah
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
its
opinion
said,
massiah
does
not
apply
because
here
the
right
to
counsel
had
attached
but
counsel
had
not
actually
been
either
retained
or
afforded.
and
this
court
again
sent
the
case
back.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
it
reversed.
mr.
michael
j.
meehan
yes.
obviously,
it's
not
a
plenary
opinion.
