mr.
attorney
general,
where
did
he
ever
say,
"i
withdraw
my
request
for
a
lawyer?
"
justice
marshall
but
he
at
no
time
withdrew
his
request?
justice
marshall
how
did
we
get
a
waiver
without
that?
justice
marshall
that's
it.
justice
marshall
where
in
the
record
is
it
that
says
that
that
caused
him
to
confess?
justice
marshall
that's
your
conclusion?
justice
marshall
but
didn't
he
the
night
before
say,
if
you'll
get
me
a
lawyer,
i'll
talk
to
you?
justice
marshall
so
didn't
that
apply
the
next
morning
too?
justice
marshall
did
the
jailor
dispute
the
statement?
justice
marshall
did
the
jailor
dispute
the
statement?
justice
marshall
was
there
any
reason
why
he
couldn't
have
been
called?
justice
marshall
but
that's
not
this
case.
i
asked
you
if
there
was
anything
in
the
record
that
said
that
and
you
said,
no.
justice
marshall
that
he
could
waive
his
right.
justice
marshall
well,
suppose,
the
night
before,
after
they
stopped
questioning
him,
they
took
him
in
another
room
and
this
new
officer
came
in
and
gave
him
his
warnings?
now,
here's
the
question.
justice
marshall
i
mean,
once
the
man
says
i
want
a
lawyer,
he
wants
a
lawyer.
justice
marshall
i
think
he
can
change
his
mind.
justice
marshall
and
i
think
he
can
express
it
when
he
changes
it.
as
i
read
everything
i
know,
including
the
fbi
regulations,
once
a
man
asks
for
a
lawyer
you
stop
questioning
him.
that's
the
fbi
regulations.
justice
marshall
you
don't
think
those
are
good
regulations,
do
you?
they
do
a
pretty
good
job.
