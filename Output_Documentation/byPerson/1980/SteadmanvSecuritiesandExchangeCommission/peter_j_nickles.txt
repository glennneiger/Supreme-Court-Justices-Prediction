mr.
peter
j.
nickles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
should
be
required
to
apply
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof,
rather
than
a
preponderance
of
evidence
standard,
in
its
disciplinary
proceedings
alleging
violations
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
statutes.
the
petitioner,
mr.
charles
steadman,
is
the
president,
chairman
of
the
board
and
sole
beneficial
owner
of
the
voting
stock
of
steadman
security
corporation.
that
company
is
registered
with
the
sec
as
investment
advisor,
advisors
and
managements,
a
number
of
mutual
funds
called
the
steadman
funds.
more
than
10
years
ago,
the
sec
commenced
a
proceeding
against
mr.
steadman
and
ssc,
and
over
the
objections
of
the
petitioner,
it
applied
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard,
defined
violations
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
statutes.
on
the
basis
of
those
violations
the
sec
imposed
the
most
extreme
sanctions
at
its
disposal.
those
sanctions
would
bar
mr.
steadman
from
association
with
any
investment
advisor.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
the
case
was
sent
back
on
remand
because
of
the
problem
the
fifth
circuit
had
with
the
articulation
of
reasons
for
the
extreme
sanctions.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
sanctions
related
not
only
to
a
bar
on
association
with
an
investment
advisor,
they
went
on
to
bar
mr.
steadman
from
association
or
affiliation
with
a
registered
investment
company,
would
suspend
him
from
any
association
with
a
broker-dealer
for
one
year.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
it
is
not
irrelevant,
because
one
gets
into
gradations
of
relevant
factors
dictating
what
standard
of
proof
should
be
applied,
and
it
will
be
our
argument
that
when
one
has
in
this
case,
a
combination
of
important
factors
such
as
the
extreme
sanctions
and
such
as
the
allegations
of
fraud,
that
that
is
a
much
easier
case
for
this
court
to
impose
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
and
we
have
that
exact--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--absolutely.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
one
does
not
stand
with
that
proposition,
one
gets
into
the
problem
the
d.c.
circuit
was
confronted
with,
after
it
issued
its
decision
in
collins
v.
sec,
in
which
it
said
we
want
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof,
and
the
sec
the
next
time
around,
in
a
case
involving
whitney,
said
well,
in
this
case
we're
only
imposing
a
nine-month
suspension
on
a
broker-dealer,
and
so
in
this
case,
since
the
sanction
is
less
than
we
imposed
in
collins,
we'll
apply
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
don't--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
authorization
to
impose
extreme
sanctions
is
the
triggering
device
to
impose
a
higher
standard
of
proof,
but
i
am
also
saying
the
fact
that
the
sec
imposed
extreme
sanctions
is
relevant
in
this
context
for
the
court
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
damage
to
reputation
and
profession
that
can
be
imposed
by
the
sec,
on
the
basis
of
the
lowest
standard
of
proof
known
to
the
judicial
system,
preponderance
of
evidence
standard.
i
might
also
add
that
the
net
effect
of
the
order
of
the
sec
that
was
recognized
by
the
sec,
is
to
force
a
sale
by
mr.
steadman
of
his
multi-million
dollar
enterprise,
steadman
security
corporation,
in
effect
a
distress
sale,
and
the
sec
provided
a
90-day
period
in
which
to
sell
the
assets.
so
you
have
not
only
a
bar,
but
you
have
a
distress
sale
of
the
assets.
now
when
the
case
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--absolutely.
your
honor,
and
the
reason
we
say
that,
and
i'll
get
into
that
in
more
detail,
when
the
case
went
up
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
said
there's
no
question
that
but
under
section
17(a)(1)
of
the
1933
act,
scienter
is
required,
and
they
said
the
sec
made
a
finding
of
intent
to
deceive.
but
what
do
we
have
in
the
findings
of
the
sec
to
sustain
that
finding?
all
we
have
is
the
mere
existence
of
the
fact
that
steadman
and
ssc
had
loans
outstanding
to
certain
banks
of
national
reputation
that
held
the
custodianship
of
these
funds.
and
the
fifth
circuit
puzzled
and
said,
why
didn't
the
sec
make
a
finding
that
mr.
steadman
or
ssc
had
intentionally
offered
the
custodianship
of
these
funds
to
the
bank
in
exchange
for
the
loans?
and
interestingly,
they
dropped
a
footnote,
which
relates
to
another
point,
and
the
footnote
said
the
reason
presumably
why
the
sec
did
not
make
those
findings
is
because
all
of
the
evidence
was
to
the
contrary.
all
of
the
bank
officials
that
were
put
on
the
stand,
testified
that
in
every
case
the
loans
were
made
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
borrower's
ability
to
repay
at
normal
competitive
interest
rates
and
that
there
was
in
fact,
no
connection,
no
connection
between
the
loans
and
the
custodianships.
but
the
sec
said,
that
doesn't
matter.
what
matters
is
that
there
is
a
potential
for
conflict
of
interest.
what
matters
is
that
mr.
steadman
potentially
might
keep
excess
amounts
of
the
fund's
assets
in
non-interest
bearing
checking
accounts
and
what
matters
is
that
he
did
not
disclose
that
potential
conflict
of
interest
over
a
period
of
years.
but
i
observe
to
the
court
that
at
no
time
did
the
sec
even
charge
mr.
steadman
with
keeping
excess
amounts
of
funds
in
non-interest
bearing
checking
accounts
and
indeed,
there
was
no
finding
and
indeed,
the
finding
was
to
the
effect
that
the
funds
benefitted
to
a
tune
of
several
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
by
reason
of
the
transfer
of
the
custodianships
of
these
banks.
so
there
was
no
benefit,
as
such,
to
mr.
steadman,
there
was
no
harm
to
the
funds,
and
on
that
basis,
the
fifth
circuit
said,
we
see
little
basis
for
a
finding
of
intentional
misconduct.
the
point
i
make
to
the
court
is
that
on
that
basis,
that
the
mere
existence
at
the
same
time
of
the
loan
relationship
and
the
custodian
relationship,
the
sec
found
mr.
steadman
guilty
of
intentional
misconduct,
stigmatized
mr.
steadman,
deprived
him
of
his
livelihood,
and
forced
a
distress
sale
of
steadman
security
corporation.
it
is
on
the
basis,
i
submit,
of
the
collateral
banking
relationships,
that
this
sanction
was
imposed.
there
are
other
matters,
but
i
submit
to
the
court,
that
with
respect
to
the
advisory
fee
issue,
a
tender
solicitation
fee
issue,
each
of
those
items
was
performed
on
the
advice
of
counsel
and
with
the
assent
and
knowledge
of
the
fund
directors.
now
what
did
the
fifth
circuit
say?
the
fifth
circuit
said
yes,
we
recognize
that
these
sanctions
are
extraordinary.
they
said,
we
recognize
that
the
sanctions
are
equivalent
to
disbarment.
we
recognize
that
in
disbarment
proceedings,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
may
be
required.
we
recognize
that
in
civil
cases
alleging
fraud,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
may
be
required.
we
recognize
that
the
d.c.
circuit
held
in
the
collins
case,
that
clear
and
convincing
proof
is
required.
but
we
can
protect
petitioners
like
mr.
steadman
by
reviewing
findings
of
violation
pursuant
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard,
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
in
particular,
we
can
review
the
sanctions.
but
what
is
the
standard
of
review
for
imposition
of
sanctions
by
administrative
agencies?
very
narrow.
fifth
circuit
recognized
that
the
standard
of
review
is
to
show
that
such
sanctions
are
without
justification
in
law,
or
in
fact.
but
the
fifth
circuit
so
recognized
that
these
sanctions
were
extreme,
that
they
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
to
show
that
sanctions
would
not
be
without
justification
in
fact
a
compelling
reason
showing
must
be
submitted
by
the
sec
on
remand.
now
our
argument
in
support
of
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof
is
threefold.
and
we
have
all
three
factors
present
in
this
case.
we
have
first,
not
only
the
authorization
to
impose
extreme
sanctions
but
the
fact
that
they
are
imposed.
we
have
second
allegations
of
fraud.
and
we
have
third
the
very
substantial,
institutional
and
procedural
advantages
that
are
accorded
the
sec
in
its
administrative
proceedings.
let
me
start
with
that
last
item--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--absolutely
not.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
not
exactly,
your
honor.
we
are
saying--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--that's
right.
just
as
in
the...
the
denaturalization
cases,
the
expatriation
cases,
we're
saying,
as
in
woodby,
the
court
has
the
power,
this
is
a
traditional
power
of
the
judiciary,
to
fashion
a
standard
of
proof
to
administer
federal
statutes
and
litigation
under
federal
statutes.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
yes,
on
section
7(c)--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--we
contend
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
and
this
court
held
in
the
woodby
case
that
language--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--it's
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
your
honor.
but
essentially
the
same
language
and
this
court
said,
that
that
language
means
to
us
scope
of
review
and
quality
of
evidence,
and
if
the
court
reviews
the
legislative
history,
it
will
find
that
at
least
its
stated
very
clearly
in
the
attorney
general's
report
which
was
primarily
relied
on
in
the
apa
development,
that
one
was
talking
about,
in
section
7(c),
scope
of
review
and
quality
of
evidence,
not
burden
of
proof.
so
we
say
that
the
apa
is
irrelevant
and--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--absolutely.
and
we
note,
your
honor,
that
the
sec
never
made
that
argument
prior
to
this
date.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
let
me--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--it's
a
regular
statutory
provision
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
permits
us
to
take
a
decision
of
the
sec
of
this
type
to
a
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
petitioner
has--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--the
statute
authorizing
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
set
forth
in
the
petition,
what
is
set
forth
in
the
petition,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
are
the
two
provisions
section
9(b)
of
the
investment
company
act
and
section
203(e)
and
(f)
of
the
investment
advisors
act,
which
were
the
provisions
that
the
sec
used
to
start
this
proceeding
going.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
they
do
not.
your
honor,
what
we
have
here,
and
if
i
might
analogize
to
the
aaron
kind
of
case
that
the
court
had,
you
have
substantive
provisions
that
are
alleged
to
be
in
violation,
in
this
case
17(a)
of
the
'33
act,
10(b)
of
the
'34
act,
206(1)
and
(2)
of
the
investment
advisors
act.
and
then
you
have,
on
top
of
the
substantive
provisions,
in
effect,
enabling
provisions
or
enforcement
provisions
pursuant
to
which
the
sec
commences
the
disciplinary
proceedings.
and
what
you
have
is
a
double
layered
analysis.
under
9(b)
of
the
investment
company
act
and
203(e)
and
(f)
of
the
advisors
act,
there
is
a
requirement
that
prior
to
the
imposition
of
a
remedy,
that
is,
any
kind
of
sanction
upon
a
respondent
found
to
have
violated
a
provision
of
the
securities
law,
the
sec
must
find
that
that
violation
was
willful
and
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
impose
such
a
sanction.
and
so
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
the
argument
not
only
that
under
common
law
it's
clear
that
in
fraud
cases
you
impose
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
but
under
this
court's
holding
in
aaron,
and
with
the
statutory
provisions
in
question
here,
you
have
a
requirement
that
scienter
be
found;
that
is,
intentional
misconduct.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
i
don't,
i
don't
have
the
specific
u.s.
code
annotation
for
the
court,
but
there's
a
standard
provision
permitting
us
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it's
not
at
all
a
matter
of
relevance
to
the
issues
here.
you
can
take
an
appeal
from
an
order...
we
could
have
taken
an
appeal
from
this
order
because
of
the
location
of
steadman
security
corporation
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
or
because
of
the
location
of
mr.
steadman
in
florida,
we
took
the
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
there's
no
substantive
provision
in
the
appeal
statute
that
governs
what
the
fifth
circuit
did.
and
i
don't
believe
you'll
find
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
any
indication
to
that
effect.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
well
certainly,
the
fifth
circuit
reviewed
the
order
and
findings
of
the
commission
in
this
case,
based
on
the
apa
standard
of
substantial
evidence,
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
then
reviewed
the
sanctions
based
on
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
yes.
let
me
start
with
the--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--yes.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
we're
not
saying
that
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--706
is
clear
and
simple
a
scope
of
review
provision.
i
believe
that
7(c)
goes
not
only
to
the
question
of
how
the
court
of
appeals
reviews
the
findings
below,
but
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence.
to
be
specific,
while
the
sec
admits
all
kinds
of
evidence,
hearsay,
double-hearsay
and
all
the
rest,
these
items
of
evidence
would
not
ordinarily
be
admissible
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
entitled
to
insure
itself
that
the
sec
has
relied
upon
probative
evidence,
substantial,
reliable
and
probative
evidence,
as
distinguished
from
hearsay
and
other
kinds
of
evidence
which
is
not
probative,
in
reaching
its
findings.
it
goes,
i
think,
as
much
to
the
question,
your
honor,
of
admissibility--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--yes.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
your
honor,
i
think
while
the
choice
of
words
may
not
be
as
fortunate
as
we
would
hope,
both
in
the
woodby
case
and
in
the
attorney
general's
report,
which
is
a
key
feature
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
apa,
it's
indicated
that's
precisely
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
using
those
terms.
let
me
talk
for
a
moment
about
the
institutional
and
procedural
advantages
of
the
sec--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--yes.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
no.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
admissibility,
yes.
the
sec's
principal
argument,
really,
is
that
the
standard
of
proof
is
designed
to
allocate
the
potential
for
error
in
a
fact
finding
proceeding.
one
is
inevitably
talking
about
probabilities
in
any
kind
of
fact
finding
proceedings,
the
sec
says
that
we
should
use
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
because
that
leaves
everything
about
equal
to
both
sides.
and
in
that
way
we
produce
the
most
correct
decisions.
now
that
may
be
true
of
when
we're
dealing
in
a
civil
or
criminal
trial
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
but
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
evidence
at
the
end
of
an
sec
proceeding
is
very
different
than
the
evidence
would
be
at
an
identical
proceeding
if
that
proceeding
were
held
in
a
civil
trial
or
a
criminal
trial
before
federal
and
state
courts.
let
me
tell
the
court
why.
the
sec
has
immense
investigative
powers,
pretrial.
the
respondent
has
none.
a
respondent
has
no
rights,
in

admissible
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
sec
is
investigator,
it
is
prosecutor,
it
is
judge,
it
is
jury.
this
court
knows
the
sec,
quite
commendably,
has
sought
to
broaden
the
scope
of
its
statutes.
but
in
some
cases,
particularly
when
the
sec
has
gotten
into
the
area
of
anti-fraud
violations,
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
limit
the
sec's
interpretation.
and
we
submit
that
it's
particularly
in
these
types
of
cases,
where
the
individual
is
no
accorded
the
rights
that
an
individual
is
accorded
in
civil
or
criminal
trials
in
a
courtroom,
that
clear
and
convincing
is
required.
and
we
say
also
that
because
of
the
allegations
of
fraud,
clear
and
convincing
is
required.
we
have
findings
of
violation
in
this
case
of
17(a),
of
10(b)
of
206(1).
each
of
which,
under
the
holdings
of
this
court,
require
a
finding
of
intentional
misconduct,
and
the
two
enforcement
provisions,
9(b)
of
the
investment
company
act
and
203(e)
and
(f)
of
the
advisors
act
require
a
showing
of
willful
violation.
this
court,
in
the
addington
case,
indicated
the
importance
in
cases
such
as
this
where
individual
rights
are
at
stake,
to
impose
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
addington
was
a
constitutional
case.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
absolutely.
but
addington
was
recent,
mr.
justice
stewart,
addington
reviewed
the
types,
the
three
basic
types
of
burden
of
proof
that
have
been
imposed
by
this
court
and
when
the
court
talked
in
addington
about
the
expatriation
and
denaturalization
cases,
schneiderman,
nishikawa,
woodby;
it
observed
that
the
standard
there
was
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing.
unequivocal
being
a
standard
which
is
perhaps
beyond
all
doubt.
and
the
court
decided
that
it
would
stick
with
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process
law.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
no.
no,
we
have
a
situation,
mr.
justice
stevens,
here,
where
we
have
an
individual
being
deprived,
potentially
being
deprived
of
his
livelihood,
and
we
allegations
of
fraud
which
require
the
kind
of
inferential
reasoning
as
to
state
of
mind.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
right.
if
both
of
those
things
were
presented
at
the
commission
proceeding,
the
court
might
want
to
review
the
standard
of
proof
being
applied
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
but
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
under
the
rulings
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
collins
and
woodby
line
of
decision,
that
this
is
an
appropriate,
heavier
standard
of
proof
right
here.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
whether
there
was
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
words
in
section
7(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
have
been
construed
to
require
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
answer
is
no.
if
the
court
will
look
at
sea
island,
which
is
the
case
cited
by
my
brother,
what
the...
what
the
late
judge
leventhal
said
in
sea
island
at
page
243
was
that
that
was
the
traditional
standard
used
in
civil
proceedings,
no
reference
at
all
to
the
apa,
but
that
for
reasons
relating
to
sanction,
relating
to
allegations
of
fraud,
it
thought
collins
should
be
applied
in
that
particular
case.
the
other
point
is
that
this
court,
in--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
clark...
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--and
it
was
a
footnote,
without
further
citation.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
the
footnote
said,
this
pattern,
pattern
was
to
limit
the
agencies
to
acting
on
reliable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence,
as
traditionally
had
been
held
satisfied
when
the
agency
decided
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
was
an
argument
specifically
rejected--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--by
the
majority.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
there's
no--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
there's
any
opinion
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
that
has
held
that
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
is
the
required
standard
when
one
is
talking
about
reliable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence.
the
majority
in
woodby
took
the
same
language
and
said
that
means
to
us
quality
of
evidence.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
to
the
attorney
general's
report
and
to
the
legislative
history,
which
we
think
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
congress
and
the
attorney
general
were
talking
about
quality
of
the
evidence.
and
finally,
there's
no
question
that
the
woodby
court
decided
that
burden
of
proof,
standard
of
proof
is
a
question
traditionally
left
to
the
judiciary--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--and
i
don't
believe
congress
has
spoken,
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
it
certainly
hadn't
in
woodby,
and
until--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--if
congress
spoke,
and
i
suggest,
mr.
justice--
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
--congress
knew
how
to
say
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
it
goes
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
for
the
purposes
of
admissibility.
mr.
peter
j.
nickles
yes,
thank
you.
