chief

e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
steadman
v.
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
nickles,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
but
that
isn't
quite
consistent
with
your
initial
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens.
you
said
it
would--
chief
justice
burger
--make
no
difference
to
you,
to
your
case,
if
there
had
been
simply
a
reprimand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferrara.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
any
basis
for
him
to
suggest
a
supervisory
power
of
the
court
over
the
regulatory
agency?
chief
justice
burger
that's
the
question.
that's
what
my
question
was
directed
at.
and
it
apparently
concerns
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
do
we
have
the
kind
of
supervisory
power
over
regulatory
agencies
that
we
do
over
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeal?
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
say
about
the
relevance
of
the
addington
holding
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
nickles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
brennan.
