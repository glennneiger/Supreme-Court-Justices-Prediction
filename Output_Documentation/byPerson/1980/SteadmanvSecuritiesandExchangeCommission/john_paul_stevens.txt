justice
stevens
mr.
nickles,
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
sanction
had
merely
been
a
reprimand,
a
very
mild
sanction.
would
you
argue
that
the
same
clear
and
convincing
standard
would
be
required?
justice
stevens
so
that
the
severity
of
the
sanction
is
really
totally
irrelevant
to
our
consideration
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
mr.
nickles,
before
you
get
into
the
specifics,
just
as
a
matter
of
putting
the
entire
argument
into
perspective,
you
are
not
making
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
stevens
are
you
making
a
statutory
argument?
justice
stevens
you're
arguing
as
a
matter
of
policy
the
court
should
fashion
a
rule
covering
standard
of
proof?
justice
stevens
now
the
government
relies
rather,
toward
the
end
of
their
brief,
on
the
language
of
the
administrative
procedures
act?
justice
stevens
and
do
you
contend
that
that
language
should
be
construed
to
impose
a
clear
and
convincing
burden,
or
that
that
language
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
stevens
that
was
a
different
statute.
justice
stevens
one
other
question,
while
we've
got
you
interrupted,
mr.
nickles.
it
is
true
that
section
706
of
the
administrative
procedures
act
dealing
with
scope
of
review,
does
contain
the
normal
provision
that
the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
shall
be
grounds
for
reversal
on
the
facts?
justice
stevens
and
are
you
saying
that's
a
substantial
duplication
of
what's
found
in
section
556--
justice
stevens
--what
is
the
difference
in
the
function
of
556(d),
the
language
the
government
relies
on,
and
the
language
in
706
defining
scope
of
review?
justice
stevens
but
the
phrase
is
"reliable,
probative
and
substantial"--
justice
stevens
--and
substantial
is
surely
not
a
test
of
admissibility.
justice
stevens
looking
at
other
analogies,
mr.
nickles,
would
your
argument
apply
equally
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
for
example?
because
they
can
impose
very
severe
sanctions.
justice
stevens
you
can
get
both
of
those
things
in
a
commission
proceeding--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
statutory
language
in
the
apa?
has
that
language
ever
been
construed
other
than
by
an
agency,
to
require
nothing
more
than
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
that's
a
strange
way
to
describe
preponderance,
in
all
candor.
justice
stevens
if
the
congress
had
meant
preponderance,
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't
say
that.
