justice

well,
let
me
ask
you,
where
do
you
think
this
standard
applies
that
you're
looking
for,
before
the
sec,
isn't
it?
justice
white
it's
not
on
review.
justice
white
it's
just
whether
it's
from
the...
what
standard
the
administrative
agency
should
use?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you
what
is
the...
is
the
board
that
did
the
adjudication
in
woodby,
was
that
an
administrative
agency?
justice
white
expressly?
justice
white
and
that's
why
section
7(c)
was
irrelevant
in
that
case?
justice
white
i
know,
but
nevertheless,
those
words
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
related
exclusively
to--
justice
white
--related
to
review
in
the...
not
to
adjudication?
justice
white
well,
what
did,
apparently
there
was
no
statutory
guide
then
for
the
standard
of
proof,
before
the
administrative
agency
in
woodby?
justice
white
and
even
if,
in...
i
suppose
you
could
argue
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
govern,
regardless
of
what
the
standard
was
before
it
was
passed?
justice
white
and
if
congress
has
spoken
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
to
the
standard
of
proof,
i
suppose
it
governs?
justice
white
well,
if
it
has,
if
we...
if
7(c)
governs
this
case,
it
governs
this
case.
justice
white
and
you
say
7(c)
applies
to
this
case?
justice
white
if
they
apply
it
to
this
case,
then--
