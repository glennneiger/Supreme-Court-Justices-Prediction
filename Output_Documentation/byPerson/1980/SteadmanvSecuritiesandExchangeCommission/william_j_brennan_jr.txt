justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
is
79-1266,
steadman
versus
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
this
petition
brings
up
for
a
review
of
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
administrative
proceedings,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
applies
a
preponderance-of-the-evidence
standard
of
proof
in
determining
whether
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
federal
security
laws
have
been
violated.
petitioner
steadman,
a
subject
of
a
disciplinary
proceeding
initiated
by
the
commission
has
insisted
that
such
violations
must
be
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
rather
than
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
on
review
of
a
commission
order
disciplining
the
petitioner
rejected
his
argument
and
held
that
in
a
disciplinary
proceeding
before
the
commission,
violations
of
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
may
be
established
by
a
preponderance-of-the-evidence.
we
agree
and
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals.
