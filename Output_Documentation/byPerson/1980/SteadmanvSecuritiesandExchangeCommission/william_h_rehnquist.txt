certainly
one
of
the
reasons,
as
i
have
understood
it,
that
in
a
criminal
case
the
proof
must
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
is
the
fact
that
the
sanction
upon
conviction
can
be
loss
of
personal
liberty
and
confinement
in
an
institution,
and
in
some
extreme
cases,
death.
justice
rehnquist
--what
precisely
is
the
statute
that
authorizes
you
to
appeal
a
finding
of
the
sec
to
the
court
of
appeals,
or
to
petition
for
review
of
it?
justice
rehnquist
is
it
set
forth
in...
in
haec
verba
in
your
petition,
or
in
the--
justice
rehnquist
--but
those
define
the
substantive
offense.
justice
rehnquist
they
don't?
justice
rehnquist
this
is,
undoubtedly,
my
own
ignorance
and
no
one
else's
fault,
but
what
is
the
statutory
language
or
statutory
citation
that
enables
you
to
appeal
at
all,
or
petition
for
review
at
all,
from
a
finding
of
the
sec
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
rehnquist
i
certainly
didn't,
and
i'm
now
puzzled
as
to...
why
congress
didn't
say
anything
about
what
standard
the
court
of
appeals
should
use
in
reviewing
findings
of
the
sec,
since
the
nlrb
standard
is
substantial
records
supported
by
substantial
evidence
supported
by
the
record
and
by
the
record
as
a
whole,
and
there
are
other
standards
for
other
agency
actions.
justice
rehnquist
so
you're
satisfied
that
the
fifth
circuit
reviewed
it
on
the
apa
standard?
justice
rehnquist
but
this
court
doesn't
have
the
supervisory
authority
over
agency
proceedings
that
it
does
over
lower
federal
courts,
does
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
apa
wasn't
passed
until
1946--
justice
rehnquist
--and
the
sec
acts
in
question
were
passed
in
the
'30's.
justice
rehnquist
so,
what
was
the
standard...
rather,
what
was
the
standard
of
proof
before
the
sec,
between
the
time
the
sec
acts
were
passed
and
the
apa
was
passed?
justice
rehnquist
standard
of
proof.
justice
rehnquist
even
in
a
fraud
case?
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
the
attorney
general's
manual
may
be
a
little
bit
one-sided
too.
congress
passed
the
walls
over
logan
act
in
'41,
and
president
roosevelt
vetoed
it,
and
didn't
get...
congress
didn't
get
around
to
passing
an
act
that
was
signed
by
the
president
until
1946.
and
certainly
it
was
in
the
interests
of
the
administration
to
give
as
limited
as
possible
a
construction
to
the
act
insofar
as
it
would
limit
agency
action.
