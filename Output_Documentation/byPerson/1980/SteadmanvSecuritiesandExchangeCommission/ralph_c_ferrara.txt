mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
agrees
with
the
petitioner
when
he
asks,
or
when
he
says,
that
this
court
should
mandate
a
standard
of
proof
more
stringent
than
the
preponderance,
and
that
his
only
basis
for
doing
that
is
that
the
court
should
exercise
policy
considerations
to
support
its
decision.
for,
as
he
correctly
points
out,
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
statute
whatsoever
that
the
petitioner
can
point
to,
and
say
that
it
serves
as
a
basis
for
his
argument
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
should
apply
to
commission
proceedings.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
there
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
court
has
exercised
its
supervisory
powers
in
other
cases,
particularly
the
cases
that
the
petitioner
has
cited
to
the
court
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
but
the
court
also
has
deferred
in
exercising
its
supervisory
powers,
when
there
has
been
a
statute.
and
we
have
learned,
through
many
cases
that
this
court
has
taught
that
the
place
to
begin
analyzing
a
securities
case
is
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
does
not,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
what
mr.
nickles
was
referring
to,
was
the
court's
supervisory
procedures
to
establish
standards
of
proof
in
lower
court
proceedings
and
perhaps
by
analogy,
to
agency
proceedings.
but
the
court
has
only--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--once
you
eliminate
the
constitutional
question
and
take,
as
a
given,
that
there's
a
statute
that
governs
the
situation,
then
the
court
in
the
past
has
said
it
would
not
exercise
any
supervisory
power
that
it
might
have.
the
court
said,
in
vance
v.
terrazas,
for
example,
when
the
congress
legislated
a
specific
standard
of
proof
to
be
employed
in
that
case,
the
court
would
defer,
absent
any
constitutional
considerations
which
it
said
was
not
involved
in
that
case.
in
our
case,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
we
have
a
statute
whose
specific
language
prescribes
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
of
proof,
that
specific
statutory
language
is
supported
by
relevant
legislative
history
and
the
varying
interpretations
of
that
language
and
that
history
have
to
be
looked
at
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
that
we
believe
is
the
correct
one
supports
the
underlying
statutory
scheme.
that's
what
this
court
has
told
the
commission,
time
and
time
again,
is
the
proper
mode
of
analysis
for
securities
cases.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well,
we
believe
that
the
court
never
need
reach
addington.
the
apa
governs
here,
it
clearly
governs
and
we
never
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
court
need
balance...
balance
the
interest
of
the
public
against
the
interest
of
mr.
steadman
in
determining
what
the
correct
standard
of
proof
is.
here,
the
apa
governs.
it's
undisputable
that...
let
me
back
up
for
a
moment
in
response
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
of
the
petitioner.
the
federal
securities
laws
do
provide
a
scope
of
review
provision;
section
25(a)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
is
typical
and
it
provides
that
any
person
who
is
aggrieved
by
an
order
of
the
commission
may
appeal
that
order
to
the
court
of
appeals.
section
25(a)
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
commission's
findings
of
fact
shall
be
supported
if...
or
should
be
affirmed
if
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
beyond
that,
the
apa
governs.
as
we
know,
the
apa
clearly
covers
all
aspects
of
commission
adjudicatory
proceedings
unless
the
federal
securities
laws
displace
it
in
some
respect.
the
scheme
of
the
federal
securities
legislation
though,
is
such
that
the
apa
substantially
governs
these
proceedings
including
section
7(c)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that
section
specifically
provides
that
no
sanction
may
be
imposed
except
in
accordance
with
reliable,
probative
and
substantial
evidence.
it
says
it
very
clearly.
what
does
the
language
mean?
the
house
report,
underlying
the
bill
that
became
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
that
inserted
the
critical
language
to
that
section
7(c),
the
words
7(c)
as
a
standard
of
proof
to
be
applied
in
administrative
adjudicatory
proceedings.
mr.
justice
clark,
who
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
was
attorney
general,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
woodby
case,
noted
that
language
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
was
similar
to
the
apa
should
be
construed
as
the
apa
language
had
always
been
construed.
and
that
is
that
the
language
"reliable,
probative
and
substantial"
is
a
standard
of
proof.
the
majority
in
woodby
did
not
agree
with
that.
curiously,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
the
very
court
that
has
decided
the
collins
and
woodby
cases,
and
the
sea
island
case,
which
was
a
case
involving
the
federal
communication
commission,
where
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
it
too
recognized
that
the
language
in
7(c)
set
a
preponderance
standard
of
the
proof
and
then
completely
ignored
the
language
and
went
on
to
apply
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
well,
that's
why
we
believe
the
words
of
section
7(c)
and
the
appropriate
legislative
history
supporting
those
words,
confirm
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
is
supported.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
it
was
not
an
agency
that
was
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
as
a
matter--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--that's
correct.
mr.
justice
clark
had
argued
in
his
dissent
that
the
words
that
had
been
put
into
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
were
similar
to
the
words
in
7(c),
and
that
7(c)
had
historically
been
interpreted
as
requiring
no
more
than
preponderance.
now--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--scope
of
review.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
that,
mr.
justice
white,
is
the
critical
difference
between
this
case
and
woodby.
in
woodby,
the
words
"reliable,
probative
and
substantial"
were
added
to
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
in
order
to
provide
a
scope
of
review
provision
for
the
courts.
it
was
not
included
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
that
purpose
at
all.
the
administrative
procedure
act
provides
quite
separately,
for
a
scope
of
review
section;
that's
section
706
or
section
10(e)
of
the
act.
and
that
brings
you,
i
guess,
to
the--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--in
woodby,
that's
absolutely
correct.
but
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case
so
dramatically
from
woodby.
again,
i
draw
from
the
prior
teachings
of
this
court
in
analyzing
securities
cases.
what
does
the
sec's
interpretation
do
to
the
underlying
statutory
scheme
of
the
apa?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
the
scope
of
review
was
substantial
evidence
for
facts.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
standard
of
proof,
was
historically
always
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
the
commission
had
always
utilized
that
standard
of
proof.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
even
in
a
fraud
case.
had
always
used
it,
and
since
1967,
the
commission's
opinions
have
articulated
its
standard
of
proof
rationale
in
terms
of
the
woodby
case.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
absolutely.
because
the
provisions,
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
scope
of
review
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
apply
to
all
administrative
adjudications
by
the
sec,
unless
another
law
applies.
and
the
sec
law,
the
federal
securities
laws
do
not
apply,
then
the
apa's
application
is
pervasive
and
absolute.
again,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
apa
very
carefully
to
distinguish
it
from
the
situation
that
we
had
in
woodby.
note
that
the
apa
beautifully
provides,
quite
separately,
for
burden
of
proof
which
it
places
on
the
agency,
quality
of
evidence
that
is,
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
it
proscribes
irrelevant,
immaterial
or
unduly
repetitive
evidence.
it
provides
separately
for
standard
of
proof
in
the
words
that
i
cited
to
you
before,
that
is,
reliable,
probative
and
substantial,
and
then
provides,
quite
separately
again,
for
scope
of
review.
it
talks
about
substantial
evidence
for
factual
findings,
and
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
other
standards
for
predictive
or
quasi-legislative
judgments.
now
the
commission's
position
is
that
even
if
this
court
disagreed,
that
the
apa
didn't
by
its
language,
its
words,
apply
to
this
proceeding,
then
nonetheless,
the
court
should
defer
to
the
commission's
judgment
to
apply
a
standard
of
proof
no
greater
than
preponderance
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has.
and
it's
been
construed
by
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
sea
island
case,
remarkably,
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
language
in
section
7(c)
and
said
that
it
traditionally
has
been
found
to
require
no
more
than
a
preponderance
and
in
the
very
next--
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
well
there's,
i
think,
a
reason
for
that.
the
reason
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
words,
when
the
words
7(c),
there's
a
note
to
the
house
report
that
i
recall,
that
says
something
to
the
effect
that
the
additional
words
"substantial"
and
"in
accordance
with"
were
added
for
the
same
reasons
that
words
were
added
in
the
preceding
footnote.
and
you
go
and
you
look
at
the
preceding
footnote
and
you
see
that
what
congress
was
about
in
both
this
part
of
7(c)
and
in
the
part
of
7(c)
referred
to
by
the
prior
note,
was
conforming
the
language
as
best
it
could,
rationalizing
the
language
as
best
it
could,
between
the
standard
of
proof
and
scope
of
review
provisions
of
the
apa,
so
that
courts
wouldn't
be
confused
with
respect
to
standards
of
proof
and
scope
of
review.
it's
interesting
how
they
did
it.
the
scope
of
review
provision
of
the
apa
had
provided
that
review
should
occur
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
of
the
proceedings.
the
standard
of
proof,
that
is,
section
7
of
the
apa,
said
nothing
about
agency
de
novo
review
placed
on
the
entire
record
of
the
proceeding.
it
was
silent.
so
that
congress
added
the
words
based
on
the
entire
record
of
the
proceeding
to
the
agency
review
part
of
the
apa,
and
it
said
it
did
that
because
some
hypertechnical
person
might
believe
that
if
the
congress
didn't
specify
that
the
agency...
by
exact
words...
that
the
agency
should
rely
on
the
entire
record
because
it
did
specify
it
for
the
appellate
function,
agencies
might
run
amuck
and
not
specify
it
on
the
entire
record.
by
similar
reasoning,
what
the
court
did
when
it
reached
the
standard
of
proof
section
was
to
say
we'd
like
to
use
the
same
words,
the
same
notions,
in
the
standard
of
proof
section
that
we
used
in
the
scope
of
review
section.
had
the
congress
done
what
you
suggested,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
that
is,
say
the
word
preponderance
in
the
standard
of
proof
section,
what
that
would
have
created
in
the
congress'
mind,
and
this
is
what
they
said
their
problem
was
in
doing
that,
is
that
ambiguity
between
the
standard
of
proof
and
scope
of
review
section,
the
standard
of
proof
section
would
have
said
agencies
are
to
decide
by
a
preponderance.
the
scope
of
review
section
would
have
said,
courts
are
to
review
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence.
and
what
i
think
the
congress
was
worried
about,
although
now
i'm
getting
away
from
what
the
actual
words
of
the
legislative
report
say,
is
that
appellate
courts
would
have
drawn
on
the
preponderance
standard
that
they
would
have
specifically
included
in
the
scope
of
review
provision
and
made
it
a
scope...
i'm
sorry,
the
standard
of
proof
provision,
and
made
it
a
scope
of
review
provision.
and
the
congress
didn't
want
that;
they
wanted
substantial
evidence
to
be
the
exclusive
test
for
judicial
review.
now
that's
a
rather
complex
answer,
but
unfortunately
what
you're
tearing
at
are
the
tissues
of
legislative
history
to
understand
why
congress
very
carefully
and...
in
this
very
carefully
honed
act...
chose
the
words
that
it
chose
to
express
the
meaning
that
it
intended
to
convey
in
sorting
through
these
various
provisions,
that
the...
i
know
the
petitioner,
in
his
reply
brief,
as
i
recall
it,
says
that
the
attorney
general's
manual,
the
authoritative
guide
to
the
apa,
doesn't
characterize
section
7(c)
as
a
standard
of
proof
section,
but
rather
characterizes
it
as
a
scope
of
review
section.
but
what
he
doesn't
include
in
his
reply
brief
is
that
the
attorney
general's
manual
was
written
before
the
bill
was
enacted.
and
the
critical
language,
the
language
about...
the
addition
of
the
language
of
"in
accordance
with"
and
"substantial"
was
not
added
until
after
the
attorney
general's
report
was
written.
and
now
we
have
mr.
justice
clark's
dissenting
opinion
in
woodby
where
he
actually,
and
i
think
correctly,
characterizes
what
the
meaning
of
that
language
is.
mr.
ralph
c.
ferrara
but
that...
that
may
very
well
be,
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
think
the
relevant
point
is
that
the
silence
of
the
attorney
general's
manual
on
whether
7(c)
is
a
standard
of
proof
provision
is
easily
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
provision
didn't
exist
in
its
present
form
at
the
time
the
attorney
general's
manual
was
written.
i'm
making
there
a
very
small
point.
we
are
not
the
ones
relying
on
or
discrediting
the
attorney
general's
manual
for
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
then
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
even
if
the...
even
if
this
court
determined
that
the
apa
specific
language
of
7(c)
was
not
applicable
here
and
it
did
not
prescribe
a
specific
standard
of
proof
as
we
think
that
it
did,
we
believe
that
the
agency's
discretion
in
utilizing
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
of
proof
should
be
respected.
our
position
there
is
that
this
court,
in
the
vermont
yankee
case,
noted
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
admittedly
in
a
rulemaking
proceeding,
provided
the
statutory
maximum.
it
provided
the
essentials.
and
then
absent
constitutional
considerations
which
the
petitioner
agrees
are
not
in
this
case,
or
other
extraordinary
or
compelling
instances,
the
agency's
discretion
should
be
respected
in
adopting
its
own
internal
procedures.
regrettably,
i
think,
at
times,
this
court
does
not
get
a
good
deal
of
direct
feedback
on
the
effect
of
its
decisions.
but
i
can
assure
you
that
the
very
commonsense
approach
that
this
court
took
in
vermont
yankee
has
saved
governmental
agencies
thousands
of
hours,
if
not
days
or
weeks,
in
conforming
with
real
or
imagined
procedures
engrafted
upon
the
administrative
process
by
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
i
can
tell
you
very
clearly
that
many
of
us
in
administrative
practice
in
washington
today
believe
that
this
case
is
to
adjudicatory
proceedings
what
vermont
yankee
was
to
rulemaking
proceedings.
ever
since
the
collins
case,
innumerable
agency
proceedings
have
been
tangled
with
questions
relating
to
the
proper
standard
of
proof.
that
is
so,
because
as
this
court
knows,
venue
for
reviewing
administrative
action
typically
will
lie
in
the
district
of
columbia.
collins
for
that
reason
might
as
well
have
been
a
case
decided
by
this
court
for
purposes
of
administrative
action.
we
are
all,
unless
we'd
like
to
buck
the
d.c.
circuit
once
again,
we
are
all
bound
by
the
collins
result.
and
it's
just
not
the
sec;
