justice

what
your
argument
really
is,
i
guess,
mr.
nickles,
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
sanction
of
this
severity
is
potentially
impossible
then
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
necessary
before
offending
the
statutes
can
be
assumed.
justice
stewart
because--
justice
stewart
--the
sanction,
for
one
thing,
as
my
brother
blackmun
said,
has
been
remanded,
and
for
another
thing
just
in
logic,
the...
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
whether
the
sanction
actually
imposed
had
been
this
one
or
some
less
severe
one.
but
it
is
a
relevant
part
of
your
argument
that
a
sanction
of
this
severity
can
be
imposed?
justice
stewart
now
addington
was
a
constitutional
case?
justice
stewart
and
you
make
no
constitutional
claims?

mr.
justice
clark,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
woodby,
spoke
as
though
it
was
well
established
that
that
language
did
establish
a
burden
of
proof
within
the
agency.
justice
stewart
that's
right.
justice
stewart
--except
that
his...
the
argument
was
that
those
were
the
words
of
governing
agencies
governed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
was
concededly
clear
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
agency
was
not
covered
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
justice
clark,
in
dissent,
simply
said
that
the
similar
words
ought
to
have
the
same
meaning.
and
he
said
that
it
was
established
what
the
meaning
was
in
agencies
governed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act.
now,
maybe--
justice
stewart
--maybe
he
was
mistaken,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion
doesn't
mean
that
he
was
disagreeing
with
the
court
as
to
that.
justice
stewart
well,
when
congress
hadn't
spoken
on
the
subject?
justice
stewart
well
that's
the
question,
yes.
but
it
certainly
hadn't
in
woodby?
