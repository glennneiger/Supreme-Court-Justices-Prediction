mr.
levy,
to
what
extent,
if
any,
do
you
disagree
with
judge
lasker's
conclusion
that
we
have
to
deal
with
this
case
in
a
contractual
context
rather
than
a
statutory
context?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute,
i
take
it,
gives
you
the
right
to
inquire
in
order
to
satisfy
yourselves
without
just
taking
anybody's
word
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
possible
too
that
government
could
get
a
lower
wholesale
price?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
had
full
knowledge,
as
the
statute
seems
to
authorize
them
to
do.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
a
little
bit
like
a
congressional
investigation,
isn't
it?
because
after
all
the
comptroller
general
represents
congress.
a
committee
of
congress
could
certainly
call
witnesses
to
determine
pricing
and
government
procurement
policies.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
hurt
you
rather
than
help
you?
because
the
statute
on
its
face
simply
grants
an
outright
authorization
without
regard
to
purpose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
the
legislature
wanted
to
have
the
government
have
access
to
all
of
your
records
in
any
of
these
kinds
of
contracts,
for
whatever
purpose
the
government
sought.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statute
it
passed
places
only
the
limits
"directly
pertinent
to".
