mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
rather
than
go
into
things
that
we
have
gone
into
in
our
briefs,
i'd
just
like
to
track
the
government's
oral
argument.
mr.
levy
started
by
saying
that
the
comptroller
general's
duty
which
is
attempted
to
be
implemented
by
what's
involved
in
this
case
is
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
prices
paid
by
the
government
to
bristol.
i
dispute
that,
in
the
entire
legislative
history
of
the
statutes
involved
here,
there
is
no
reference
to
authorizing
the
comptroller
general
to
explore
the
question
of
reasonableness.
the
entire
legislative
history
concerns
itself
with
protection
of
the
government
against
fraud,
impropriety,
abuse,
and
overreaching.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
that
is
correct,
but
if
we're
searching
for
a
legislative
intent--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--if
the
congress
had
said
that,
there'd
be
no
question
about
it,
but
the
congress
did
not
say
that.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
these
open
the
question
of,
pertinent
to
what?
mr.
levy
is
claiming
it
means
pertinent
to
reasonableness
of
the
price.
i
maintain
that
when
one
looks
into
the
legislative
history
one
finds
that
the
pertinency
relates
to
fraud,
overreaching,
impropriety,
and
abuse.
it
was
not
intended
to
empower
the
comptroller
general
to
explore
for
better
ways
of
negotiating
contracts.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
agree
thoroughly
on
those
facts,
but
those
are
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes,
and
your
honor's
question
is
directed
again
to
pertinency,
pertinency
for
the
prices
that
were
charged
the
government
and
what
went
into
determining
those
prices.
now,
if
research
and
development
costs
had
been
taken
into
account,
factored
into
the
prices
charged
the
government
on
these
contracts,
then
we
would
agree--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--most
times.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes.
that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
it's
quite
pertinent
here,
your
honor.
you're
absolutely
correct
as
to
the
difficulty
of
allocating
r&d
expenses.
for
example,
in
the
field
that
bristol
is
in,
much
r&d
turns
out
to
be
fruitless.
it
doesn't
even
result
in
a
product.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
suspect
that
it
is.
therefore,
how
can
one
allocate
to
products
that
are
being
successfully
marketed
a
cost
for
research
and
development--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--there
could
be
theoretically.
absolutely.
but
that
would
pertain
primarily
to
cost-plus
contracts,
which
are
not
involved
here.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
oh,
but
the
statutory
provision,
your
honor,
relates
to
the
particular
contract
that
contains
the
clause
that
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
therefore,
the
directly
pertinent
to
this
contract
is
what
counts.
it
excludes
matters
that
might
be
pertinent
to
other
contracts
or
to
no
contracts
at
all.
it
is
only
those
matters,
those
transactions,
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
then
the
contractual
clause
which
relate,
which
are
directly
pertinent
the
contract
that
contains
the
clause.
everything
else
is
outside
those
perimeters.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
may
i...
and
i
did
point
this
out
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
it
would
bear
re
iteration
here:
try
to
be
prophylactic
against
an
ambiguity
in
the
term
"allocate".
there
are
two
stages
at
which
allocation
of
r&d
expenses
might
be
made.
one
would
be
in
arriving
at
the
price
to
be
charged
the
government
in
a
given
contract
where
in
addition
to
the
direct
manufacturing,
labor
costs,
and
such,
bristol
could...
but
has
not...
say,
we
also
have
to
recapture
in
this
contract
some
portion
of
what
we've
been
expending
for
r&d.
if
they
did
that,
then
bristol
would
give
the
c.g.
access
to
those
records,
but
bristol
did
not.
now--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--we
don't
allocate
them
to
the
price,
and
it's
price
that
counts
here.
mr.
levy
has
referred
frequently
to
costs.
it's
not
costs,
it's
price
to
the
government
that
counts.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
oh,
yes,
yes.
in
fact,
i
don't
think
that's
disputed.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
we
do
it
eventually
out
of
the
general
pool,
but
we
do
not--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--as
with
any
business,
all
revenue
eventually
is
available
to
meet
any
expense
of
the
business.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
anything;
anything
becomes
available
to
meet
an
expense,
if
it's
needed.
judge
lasker
said
that
the
only
expenses
the
only
bristol
labs
costs
that
would
be
excludable
under
the
government's
theory
would
be
those
that
are
recoverable
solely
from
nongovernmental
business.
i
think
he
was
incorrect
even
in
that.
because,
suppose
that
the
revenue
from
nongovernmental
business
was
not
enough
to
cover
the
total
costs
of
the
business.
bristol
would
have
to
draw
from
governmental
contracts--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--they've
got
to
make
it
up
somewhere.
and
that's
why
there's
no
limit
to
the
records
as
has
been
indicated
by
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe,
and
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
there's
no
limit.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes,
we
have
that
in
our
brief.
all
direct
manufacturing
costs
including
manufacturing
overhead,
the
specific
distribution
expenses.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
well,
they
can...
no,
they
don't,
your
honor,
but
by
simple
arithmetic
subtraction
of
the
price
they
pay,
from
the
price
that
the
government
pays,
of
the
costs
that
we
do
give
them,
they
know
that
the
residue
has
to
be
all
the
unallocated
costs,
namely,
general
overhead
and
administration,
general
distribution,
and
research
and
development,
and
promotion
and
advertising.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
well,
we
hope
so.
i've
got
to
get
paid.
what
bristol
has
said
it
would
give
are
its
manufacturing
cost...
this
appears
at
page
6
of
our
brief...
manufacturing
costs
such
as
raw
and
packaging
materials,
labor
and
fringe
benefits,
quality
control
and
supervision,
then
manufacturing
overhead
such
as
plant
administration,
production,
planning,
warehousing,
utilities,
and
securities,
royalty
expense,
and
in
a
general
way
the
cost
of
delivery
to
the
sites
specified
in
the
contract.
may
i
point
out,
in
some
of
the
statements
by
gao
representatives
they
have
cited
the
necessity
of
getting
into
the
costs
that
are
incurred
in
order
to
fulfill
the
government
contracts.
in
other
words,
these
would
be
the
incremental
costs
involved
in
the
contract.
the
kind
of
costs
that
we're
talking
about
today,
the
r&d,
the
general
administration,
and
the
like,
are
costs
that
bristol
would
incur
even
if
it
didn't
have
these
contracts.
they
are
not
incurred
in
order
to
perform
the
obligations
under
these
contracts.
they
would
be
there
and
they
would
be
exactly
the
same
regardless
of
these
contracts.
so
that
they
don't
affect
the
price
that
is
charged
to
the
government.
therefore
we
say,
they
are
not
directly
pertinent.
now,
the
amendment,
the
hoffman
amendment
that
put
the
word
directly
into
the
statute.
while
the
legislative
history
on
it
may
be
rather
brief,
it
is
not
sparse
in
meaning
because
it
followed
a
very
strong
movement
in
the
committee
to
curtail
the
powers
of
the
comptroller
general
because
of
fear
of
snooping.
the
harvey
amendment
was
rejected
but
it
had
a
very
sizeable
constituency
and
that
constituency
was
then
called
upon,
of
course,
to
pass
upon
the
final
hardy
amendment.
mr.
hoffman
representing
that
constituency
and
its
still
abiding
concerns,
spoke
for
adding
the
word
"directly"
in
order
to
prevent
what
he
called
"snooping".
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
well,
that
might
be,
but
i
think
there
is
some--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--well,
that
would
mean
then,
your
honor,
i
fear,
that
the
comptroller
general
would
be
able
to
see
everything
he
wants
to
see
even
though
he
is
not
entitled
to
see
it.
i
think
these
are
issues
that
would
have
to
be
decided
by
a
court,
just
as
they
are
presented
today.
we
have
stated...
and
don't
forget,
please,
that
pursuant
to
judge
lasker's
order,
the
comptroller
general
was
given
full
ability
to
depose
the
bristol
laboratories
people
to
find
out
exactly
how
they
do
allocate,
what
they
don't
allocate,
how
they
arrive
at
the
prices
they
charge
the
government.
having
that
information,
they
then
come
back
with
the
facts
that
are
now
on
the
record,
and
based
on
those
facts
i
think
our
argument
is
a
perfectly
sound
one,
that
the
judiciary
is
in
a
position
to
say
that
within
the
meaning
of
"directly
pertinent"
as
it
appears
in
the
contracts...
and
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
the
contract
thing
again...
but
as
it
appears
in
the
contracts,
and
in
the
statute
itself,
does
not
embrace
costs
of
bristol
that
in
no
way
affected
or
went
into
or
were
factored
into
determining
the
prices
charged
the
government.
they
were
not
directly
pertinent
to
that.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes,
and
we've
agreed
that
the
government
can
have
them.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
we
don't
disagree
with
them.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
think
that
is
their
argument
where
the
prices
in
the
fixed
contract
do
not
result
from
negotiations
that
discussed
or
took
into
account
any
particular
costs.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
in
the
course
of
negotiation,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
way--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--we
did
not
submit
any
costs
to
the
government.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
under
that
theory
and
the
type
of
contract
we're
dealing
with
here,
there
would
be
no
cost
figures.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
don't
disagree
with
it
either.
i
think
there's
a
very
plausible
argument
to
be
made
for
it.
i
don't
want
to
attempt
to
make
amici's
arguments
for
them,
i
might
not
do
them
justice.
but
we
do
not
disagree
with
them.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
it
is
not
our
case.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
it
would
be
if
we
didn't
submit,
but
we
have
agreed
that
we
will
submit
the
cost
figures--
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--oh,
no,
no.
i
don't
believe
we
did.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
your
honor,
respectfully,
i
would
read
it
the
other
way
as
being
a
further
constriction
that
there
must
be
direct
pertinence
to
transactions
which
relate
to
the
contract.
and
as
i
have
just
pointed
out,
the
r&d
expenses,
all
these
so-called
unallocated
expenses
do
not
relate
to
the
contract
that
is
in
issue
here.
because
they
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
no
such
contract.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
and
that's
my
point.
do
we
give
him
the
right
to
look
into
records
that
he
may
have
no
right
to
look
into
in
order
to
find
out
whether
he's
got
a
right
to
look
into
them?
this
is
exactly
why
judge
lasker
handled
the
deposition,
the
discovery
process
in
the
district
court
the
way
he
did.
he
gave
full
right
to
the
comptroller
general's
representatives
to
depose
to
their
heart's
content
the
bristol
laboratories
personnel
as
to
all
their
methods
of
fixing
the
prices,
but
not
the
details,
not
the
arithmetic
or
financial
details:
the
methods
of
keeping
their
books,
the
methods
of
doing
their
accounting,
the
methods
of
doing
their
pricing
to
the
government.
with
all
of
that
information
they
come
back
and
then
the
district
court
makes
the
factual
decision
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
at
times
this
court
has
said,
when
the
two
lower
courts
are
in
agreement
on
the
facts,
the
supreme
court
becomes
very
reluctant
to
upset
them.
we
do
have
that
total
agreement
with
the
two
courts.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
yes,
sir?
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
don't
believe
they
are
separately
broken
out.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
hesitate
to
give
a
firm
answer,
your
honor,
because
i
just
don't
know.
it
has
been
my
impression
that
they
are
not
separately
broken
out.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
and
if
they
were,
they
might
be
broken
out
on
a
total
corporate
basis
rather
than
by
bristol
laboratories
division
of
bristol-myers.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
--no,
i
don't
believe
the
full
contract
is
there
but
the
joint
appendix
does
show
an
identification
of
the
contracts.
i
think
there's
an
affidavit
by
mr.
ahart
that
shows,
that
identifies
the
contracts
that
have
in
them
the
specific
clauses
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
think
that
virtually
all
of
them
would
be
competing
in
the
sense
that
if
the
identical
formula
is
not
available
that
alternates
would
be
available
to
achieve
the
same
pharmacological
results.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
there's
considerable
elasticity.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
i
believe
they
are;
yes.
they
run...
yes...
they
run
on
usually
about
five
percent
below
the
prices
to
retail
establishments
direct
sales
to
retail
establishments.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
well,
on
that
point,
and
on
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
about
whether
there
isn't
some
assurance
from
the
competitive
aspect
that
the
prices
are
right,
we
can
turn
again
to
the
legislative
history.
you
see,
this
came
up
when
congress
found
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
korean
crisis
and
there
was
a
necessity
of
getting
supplies
for
the
armed
services,
and
at
the
same
time
inflation
was
rearing
its
very
ugly
head,
as
we
know
it
today.
so
that
suppliers
were
being
caught
in
a
bind.
they
would
make
a
contract
price
and
then
when
they
went
to
their
sub-suppliers,
they
were
paying
higher
and
higher
amounts
than
what
they
had
figured
on.
this
began
to
present
a
very
difficult
problem
for
satisfactory
procurement
for
the
armed
services,
which
gave
rise
to
the
renegotiation
statute.
and
then
congressman
hardy,
in
connection
with
renegotiation,
wanted
some
protection
for
the
government,
that
these
things
just
couldn't
be
run
wild
on
the
renegotiation.
and
hence
his
amendment
which
he
said,
and
which
congressman
celler
as
well,
said
would
serve
as
a
deterrent
against
a
sword
of
damocles
hanging
over
the
suppliers
heads
which
would
deter
them
from
engaging
in
abusive,
fraudulent,
and
overreaching
practices.
but
mr.
hardy
at
page
97,
congressional
record,
page
13198,
explaining
the
rationale
behind
all
of
this,
said:
"in
normal
times
competitive
bidding
generally
operates
as
a
brake
on
the
price
which
a
contractor
can
demand
from
the
government
for
his
goods
and
services.
"
in
normal
times.
so
this
was
an
emergency.
actually,
this
entire
statutory
provision
was
generated
to
cope
with
an
emergency
situation
that
does
not
exist
today,
which
may
come
up
later.
but
certainly
as
of
today
the
competitive
bidding
situation
to
which
reference
has
been
made
does
serve
as
a
brake
and
does
serve
as
a
protection
and
an
assurance
that
the
prices
are
not
overreaching
or
fraudulent.
fraud
comes
in
with
a
cost-plus
again,
which
we're
not
dealing
with
here,
fraudulent
representation
as
to
what
costs
are.
but
where
certain
costs
have
not
even
been
taken
into
account
in
reaching
the
price,
even
though
later
when
for
accountancy
purposes
or
for
analytical
purposes
retrospectively
the
business
wants
to
see
how
has
it
done,
why
has
it
done
what
it
has
done,
can
it
improve
its
methods
of
operation?
this
is
a
retrospective
analysis.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
fixing
the
prices
to
the
government
in
the
first
place.
that's
why
i
say
this
term
"allocate"
can
be
a
little
bit
equivocal,
and
misleading,
if
we
don't
keep
clearly
in
mind
the
difference
between
allocating
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
the
prices
to
the
government
and
allocating
later
on
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
operations
of
the
business,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
fixing
the
price
to
the
government
except
on
future
contracts.
but
not
on
the
contracts,
as
the
statute
provides,
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
address
this
question
that
was
raised
by
the
bench
early
on
with
mr.
levy
about
whether
this
is
a
case
involving
statutory
construction
or
interpretation
of
a
contract.
it
is
very
clear
in
the
legislative
history
and
we
have
the
quotations
at
pages
three
and
four
of
our
brief,
that
congress
deliberately
and
advisedly
put
the
relationship
between
the
comptroller
general
and
the
supplier
on
to
a
contractual
basis.
congress
realized
the
difference.
in
one
exchange,
and
this
appears
in
two
exchanges,
and
the
first
one,
you
can
find
at
page
four
of
our
brief,
where
one
of
the
congressmen,
mr.
eberharter,
said
to
mr.
hardy,
"now,
i
would
like
to
ask
one
question.
"
"does
this
refer.
"
--namely,
the
hardy
amendment...
"does
this
refer
to
contracts
that
have
been
made
in
the
past?
"
mr.
hardy:
"it
could
not
refer
to
contracts
that
have
been
made
in
the
past
because
it
requires
the
insertion
of
a
clause
in
contracts.
"
mr.
eberharter:
"i
see.
"
"i
notice
that
you
give
power
to
the
comptroller
general.
"
"it
does
not
give
him
power
to
inspect
the
books
and
records
but
requires
that
a
clause
be
inserted
in
the
contracts
permitting
him
to
inspect.
"
a
clear
differentiation
in
the
sponsor's
mind
between
a
statutory
power
and
whatever
permission
he
might
obtain
via
a
contract,
namely,
via
the
application
of
law
of
contracts,
contract
principles.
then,
a
little
bit
later,
congressman...
at
page
13376
of
97
congressional
record...
said
that
the
comptroller
general's
right
of
access
"is
given
him
in
the
contract.
"
"the
right
is
not
given
him
in
the
bill.
"
therefore,
if
we
are
looking
for
congressional
intent,
while
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
by
the
term
"directly
pertinent"...
and
that
is
not
all
too
clear;
congress
never
defined
that...
one
thing
is
clear
beyond
any
question,
that
congress
did
not
intend
access
powers
to
flow
from
the
statute
to
the
comptroller
general,
but
intended
only
that
there
go
to
the
comptroller
general
such
permission
for
access
as
might
come
to
him
from
a
contract,
and
that
would
have
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
principles
that
govern
contracts.
so
that
i
submit
that
judge
lasker
was
100
percent
correct
when
he
approached
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
contract.
but
i
would
say
that
even
on
a
basis
of
statutory
construction,
if
the
word
"pertain"
is
a
word
of
some
limitation,
"directly
pertain"
has
to
be
even
more
limiting,
and
if
it
has
to
be
directly
pertinent
to
transactions
that
are
related
to
the
particular
contract,
you
have
a
very
narrowly
circumscribed
area.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
no,
it
does
not.
i
understand
that
there's
been
an
amendment
which
will
become
effective
in
the
future,
which
would
give
the
comptroller
general
subpoena
power.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
no,
no.
bristol
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
action,
and
then
the
government
counter-claimed.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
well,
it
would
be
more
than
an
implied
cause
of
action,
or
they'd
have
an
action
on
contract.
they
sue
on
the
contract.
mr.
gilbert
h.
weil
there
has
to
be;
yes.
that's
the
whole
thrust
of
congress
was
in
that
direction.
i
think
it's
unmistakable,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
