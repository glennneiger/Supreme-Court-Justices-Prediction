justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
judge
this
case
on
the...
is
it
submitted
on
the
assumption
by
one
or
both
sides
that
research
and
development
costs
were
a
part
of
the
costs
of
the
government's
products
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
opponent
says
that
they...
those
costs
did
not
directly
contribute
to
the
government's
costs.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
was?
there
have
been
two
groups
of
contracts
with
this
same
company,
one
a
cost-plus
contract
and
this
kind
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you'd
just
audit
what
they've
put
down
as
their
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
made,
if
they
put
down,
if
they
didn't
put
down
any,
and
didn't
allocate
any
research
and
development
cost
to
it,
to
your
cost,
you
wouldn't
audit
their
research
and
development.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be;
that
may
be,
but
as
i
understand
their
submission
here
that
they
say
they
didn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--oh,
they're
going
to
get
their
money
out
for...
but
they
aren't
going
to
get
it
from
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
you
can't
in
this,
on
the
facts
here,
you
just
can't
tell
whether
or
not
their
research
and
development
costs
entered
into
the
price
charged
the
government,
and
therefore
you
must
be
able
to
find
out.
justice
white
well,
mr.
weil,
suppose
you've
got,
you
do
have
r&d
expense
and
let's
suppose
that
to
develop
certain
products,
a,
b,
c,
which
you
are
selling
to
the
government,
you
did
have
research
and
development
costs.
let's
just
assume
that.
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
case
here,
but
if
you
assume
that
but
you
just
haven't
allocated
your
research
and
development
costs
to
these,
there
are
no
records
of
allocation
but
nevertheless
you
just
know
that
there
were
research
and
development
costs
involved
in
coming
up
with
these
successful
products
that
you're
now
selling
the
government--
justice
white
--now,
how
about
those
research
and
development
costs?
if
you
did
approach
the
job
of
allocation,
ordinary
accounting
practice
would
say,
why,
of
course,
part
of
this
should
be
allocated
to
these
products
a,
b,
and
c.
justice
white
then
you
don't
allocate
them?
justice
white
is
there
some
finding,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
you
did
not
allocate
them
to
price?
justice
white
and
that
you
certainly
recover
r&d
cost
from
somebody?
justice
white
including
the
profits
you
make
on
the
government
contract?
justice
white
like
getting
interest
on
bank
loans?
justice
white
in
order
to
make
up
the
loss.
justice
white
and
maybe
just
a
hair
of
profit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
weil,
from
what
you've
said
so
far
i
take
it
you
think
that
some
cost
figures
are
required
by
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
you
don't
agree
with
some
of
the
amicus
views
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
take
it,
it
is
submitted
by
something
i
read
that
no
cost
figures
in
a
fixed
price
contract
is
required
by
the
statute
to
be
turned
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
submit
any
cost
figures
to
the
government,
you
don't
have
to
verify
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
if
you
agreed
with
your,
with
the
amicus
that
i
read,
there
wouldn't
be
any
cost
figures
called
for
by
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
don't
urge
us
to
adopt
that
position?
the
way
it
stands
now?
justice
white
well,
it
is
in
the
sense
that
you
didn't
submit
any
cost
figures.
justice
white
but
you
didn't
submit
them
in
the
course
of
negotiations?
