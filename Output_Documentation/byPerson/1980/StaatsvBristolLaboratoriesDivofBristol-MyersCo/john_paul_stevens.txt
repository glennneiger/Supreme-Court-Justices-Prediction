justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
just
to
get
something
on
the
table?
would
you
in
the
course
of
your
argument
tell
us
why
it's
important
for
the
government
to
know
how
the
money
spent
on
research
and
development
was
spent?
i
mean,
why
do
you
want
that
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
challenge
the
fact
that
they
spent
as
much
as
they
say
they
spent
on
research?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
they
even
given
you
the
percentage
of
their
total
expenditures
that
go
into
research
and
development?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
give
you
a
balance
sheet
figure
that
this
year
we
spent
$97
million
on
research
and
development,
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
they
gave
you
their
tax
returns
that
showed
it
was
accurate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
asking
you
is
do
you
really
want
to
look
at
how
much
they
spent
on
different
kinds
of
experiments
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
really
know
what
you're
looking
for
here
is
why
i'm
asking
these
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
tell
you
what's
assignable
to
it.
they
tell
you
all
their
direct
costs
and
manufacturing
costs,
as
i
understand
it.
the
only
thing
they
don't
tell
you
is
the
unallocated
costs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
know
why
you...
i
still
don't
understand
why
it's
important
to
you
to
go
behind
some
kind
of
a
lump
sum
figure
on
all
of
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
charged
you
$10
for
a
product
and
they
say,
we
can
show
that
$2.90
is
attributable
to
direct
cost.
the
other
$7.10
is
either
unallocated
costs
or
profit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
matter
if,
of
the
$7.10
in
my
hypothetical,
if
$1
was
profit
and
$7
research
or...
i
don't
understand
what
difference
it
makes.
it
seems
to
me
you
might
well
say,
if
your
direct
costs
are
less
than
20
percent
or
something,
the
price
is
out
of
line.
but
i
don't
know
why
you
care
about
how
they,
what
they
do
about
the
other
80
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
always
will
know
what
the
percentage
of
price
that
the
direct
costs
represent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
say
none
of
it's
assignable
to
the
product.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
rate?
judge
lasker
analyzed
your
theory
and
he
concluded
that
under
their
allocation...
there
are
no
excludable
records
under
your
theory.
you
have
to
see
everything.
do
you
disagree
with
his
appraisal
of
the
request
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
that
they
would
not
have
to
show
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you've
had
some
opportunity.
they
did
tender
some
records,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
your
purpose
is
to
see
if
you
cannot
allocate
costs
to
non-government
business.
you'd
have
to
do
a
rather
thorough
audit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
looked
at
what
they've
given
you
yet,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
not
looked
at
what
they've
given
you
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
levy,
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
i
forget
about
this.
are
these
contracts
subject
to
renegotiation
if
the
prices
were
excessive
or
do
you
want
the
information
for
future
negotiated
contracts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
have
another
remedy?
if
they
didn't
give
you
enough
information,
you
could
say,
well,
we're
just
not
going
to
give
you
any
more
contracts
because
these,
on
the
face
of
them,
look
outrageous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
a
public
company,
by
the
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
do
they
have
publicly
available
financial
statements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
so
they
may
not
have
division
accounting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
ask
for
full
access,
i
guess
you
really
want
to
read
the
words
"directly
pertinent"...
i
mean,
the
statute,
as
though
those
words
just
weren't
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
haven't
suggested
to
me
any
limit
on
what
you
want
to
see,
which
you
have
the
right
to
see.
i
mean,
as
you
go
into
it
and
say,
we
need
a
little
more,
you
could
ask
for
an
entire
audit
of
the
entire
company,
if
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
judge
lasker
thought
it
would
be
in
this
case.
you
don't
know
because
you
haven't
looked
at
the
record,
but
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
in
order
to
satisfy
yourselves
you
may
need
to
look
at
everything?
because
i
don't...
or
can
you
tell
me
one
category
of
records
that
you
would
say
you
would
never
want
to
look
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
that
even
if
research
and
development
is
combined
for
all
those
other
divisions
in
this
division?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
would
make
it?
they
wouldn't...
say
they
don't
make
it,
they
just
say,
we
have
research
and
development,
we
have
our
foreign
business,
our
veterinary
business,
and
all
the
rest,
it's
$97
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
as
a
matter
of
accounting
practice
don't
allocate
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
always
could.
i
mean,
a
good
accountant
can
always--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
would
want
to
be
able
to
verify
it
by
looking
at
the
records
of
the
foreign
business
and
the
veterinary
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
really
no
category
you
don't
want
to
have
the
right
to
look
at
if
you
think
it's
necessary
in
order
to
make
a
proper
allocation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
say,
we
don't
allocate,
and
you
say,
you
have
a
duty
to
allocate,
and
if
you
don't
do
it
yourself
we
want
to
look
at
the
records
that
will
enable
us
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
each
case
they
say,
well,
we
don't
do
it.
you
have
to
do
it,
you're
going
to
decide
how
to
do
it,
you're
going
to
decide
whether
to
use
square
footage
or
gross
sales
or
overhead
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
are
a
lot
of
established,
you
know,
acceptable
accounting
practices,
there
are
all
sorts
of
alternatives
that
are
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
always
true
that
when
they
don't
allocate
themselves
you're
going
to
have
to
look
at
everything
to
decide
what
method
of
allocation
you're
going
to
think
is
the
proper
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
the
end
of
it
if
they
said,
we
allocate
90
percent
of
our
research
and
development
to
the
government
contracts,
you
don't
think
you'd
go
behind
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
would
have
reason
to
suspect
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
you
develop
this,
would
you
tell
us
in
a
little
more
detail
what
records
you
are
willing
to
tender
to
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
know,
for
example,
what
your
aggregate
research
and
development
costs
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
the
statute?
does
the
statute
provide
a
remedy
in
the
event
that
the
company
wrongfully
refuses
to
make
the
records
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
did
this
suit
arise?
did
it
arise
by
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
no
remedy.
if
you
just
said,
no,
they
have
no
statutory
remedies
unless
there's
some
kind
of
an
implied
cause
of
action;
they
would
have
no
right
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
it
has
to
be
breach
of
contract,
unless
there's
a--
