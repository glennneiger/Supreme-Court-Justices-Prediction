f.
powell,

mr.
levy,
were
these
drugs
standard
drugs
that
were
available
for
purchase
by
the
public
generally?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
did
the
government
pay
the
same
price
that
the
public
paid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
there
any
suggestion
that
there
was
any
conspiracy
to
maintain
prices
at
an
improper
level?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
quite
different,
isn't
it,
from
negotiating
a
contract
to
build
a
submarine
or
aircraft
carrier
or
to
buy
an
airplane
or
a
tank?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
levy,
you
said
that
even
if
there
were
no
allocation
the
company
would
have
to
do
it.
research
and
development
comes
up
with
a
wonder
product
that
helps
cure
cancer.
how
do
they
allocate
that
between
drugs
they
sell
abroad
and
those
they
sell
in
the
united
states,
the
cost
of
research
and
development?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
any
company;
how
would
you
do
it?
you
have
a
research
and
development
department
that
serves
wherever
you
sell
products
all
over
the
world,
you
have
a
division
that
serves
the
united
states,
you
have
a
division
that
serves
abroad.
research
and
development
serves
all
of
them.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
do
you
allocate
it?
you've
spent
$100
million
over
20
years
developing
a
cure
for
cancer.
how
are
you
going
to
allocate
it
between
the
united
states
and
abroad?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
sort
of
investigation
could
take
years,
with
dozens
of
accountants,
in
a
great
corporation
like
this
one.
i
don't
understand
why
there
isn't
some
limitation
to
the
records
that
you
would
insist
on
seeing.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
you've
been
limited
to
that
extent,
but
your
principle
has
no
limit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
weil?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
r&d
expenses.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
were
not
made
public
by
your
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
most
pharmaceuticals,
i
had
thought,
were
very
proud
of
their
r&d
expenditures
and
reported
them,
either
in
their
annual
reports
on
in
their
10-k's.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
perhaps
not.
i
don't
think
it--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--would
you...
first
of
all,
is
the
contract
in
the
record
somewhere
or
other?
i
haven't
seen
it.
i
don't
want
you
to
look--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
contract
indicate
what
types
of
drugs
beyond
being
prescription?
are
they
drugs
that
are
subject
to
competitive
conditions
in
the
market
and
if
they're
prescription
drugs
perhaps
you
have
them
patented,
but
are
they
competing
drugs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
these
are
priced--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--these
are
wholesale
prices
that
are
published?
are
they
available
to
any
purchaser
by
wholesale?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
as
mr.
levy
said,
the
competitive
market
would
be
a
restraint
on
any
holding
up
of
the
government.
