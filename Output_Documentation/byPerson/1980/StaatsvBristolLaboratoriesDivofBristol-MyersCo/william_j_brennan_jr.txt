well,
mr.
levy,
you
do
have
the
problem,
i
gather,
that
when
congress
amended
this
statute
to
add
"directly
pertains
to"
it
had
some
purpose
in
mind
in
the
way
of
limitation,
didn't
it?
justice
jr.
no,
no,
but
doesn't
this
language
on
its
face
suggest
congress
was
imposing
a
limitation?
justice
jr.
oh.
justice
jr.
well,
if
that
was
added
to
the
statute?
justice
jr.
and
isn't
there
some
legislative
history
that
suggests
it
was
added
because
congress
wanted
to
limit
it?
justice
jr.
why
do
you
think
congress
added
that
word?
justice
jr.
congress
went
to
all
this
trouble
just
to
add
that
word?
justice
jr.
and
what
do
you
say
congress'
purpose
was?
justice
jr.
--well,
mr.
levy,
if
you've
got
everything
you
wanted
and
then
it
was
determined
that
the
price
was
25
cents
too
high,
would
you
be
able
to
recoup
it
from
the--
justice
jr.
--but
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
that
excess
back,
would
you?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
we
have
no
constitutional
question
here
at
all?
justice
jr.
it's
nothing
but
the
statute?
justice
jr.
that
you
determine
as
representative.
justice
jr.
incidentally,
was
254(c)
the
same
time
2313(b)?
