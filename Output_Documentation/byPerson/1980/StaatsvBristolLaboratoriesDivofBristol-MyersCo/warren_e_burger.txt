chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
staats
v.
bristol
laboratories.
mr.
levy,
i
think
now
you
may
proceed,
if
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
the
allocation
what
the
comptroller
general
is
trying
to
find
out
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can't
answer
it
without
seeing
it,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
mr.
levy,
that
for
whatever
reasons
the
department
of
justice
reached
the
point
where
it
thought
that
there
were
some
problems.
is
there
any
barrier
to
their
sending
the
fbi
accountants
in
to
this
company
and
going
to
them
from
attic
to
basement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
to
be
criminal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
be
here
or
it
could
be
a
civil
claim,
a
potential
civil
claim
against
the
company
for
overcharges,
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
couldn't
we
take
judicial
notice
that
that's
precisely
what
the
department
of
justice
does
and
has
done
for
many,
many
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
some
courts
of
appeals'
opinions
have
held
that
that
they
can't
"blacklist"
a
contractor
without
some
kind
of
notice
and
hearing.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
one
of
the
broad
objectives,
to
go
to
the
objectives,
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
misallocation,
that
is
allocating
to
some
of
the
government
contracts
costs
which
in
good
sound
practice
should
be
allocated
elsewhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
we
had
the
contract
renegotiation
statute
and
the
renegotiation
board,
that
was
the
whole
object
of
that
enterprise,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
i
think
we'd
better
hear
from
your
friend.
mr.
weil.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
take
the
overreaching
now.
if
a
substantial
amount
of
research
and
development
was
allocated
to
the
particular
contract
when
in
fact
it
was
demonstrable
that
it
was
a
covert
allocation,
would
not
be
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
taking
about
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
you
were.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that's
the
comptroller
general's
mandate
from
the
congress,
to
inquire
into
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
and
i
would
agree
on
the
basis
of
experience
that
sometimes
research
and
development
simply
cannot
be
allocated
with
precision.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
you
just
don't
know.
the
accountants
do
the
best
they
can,
usually
having
in
mind
what's
the
best
for
the
client,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
true
of
almost
all
r&d?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
even
conceding
its
difficulty,
would
you
agree
that
there
could
be
a
deliberate
misallocation
in
the
interest
of
the
producer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
would
you
limit
it
to
cost-plus
contracts?
doesn't
that
shed
light
on
future
contracts
in
the
same
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
mr.
weil,
would
you
not
agree
that
sometimes
you
cannot
make
a
determination
whether
it
is
directly
related
until
after
you
see
them
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
comptroller
general
can't
demonstrate
that
in
advance,
can
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
take
you
back
to
that
amendment.
the
inserting
the
word
"directly",
which
you
suggest
is
a
limiting
word
and
must
mean
something.
that's
followed
by
"pertaining
to"
and
"involve"
transactions
relating
to
the
contract
or
subcontract.
now,
isn't
that
something
of
a
giving
with
one
hand
and
taking
away
with
another?
if
"directly"
narrows
it,
then
the
language
relating
to
"certainly"
is
almost
open-ended,
if
it
relates
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
comptroller
says
that's
what
he
wants
to
find
out,
whether
they're
related
to
and
whether
they
are
directly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
of
80-264,
staats,
the
comptroller
general
of
united
states
against
bristol
laboratories
and
by
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning.
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court
and
justice
stewart
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
