mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
2nd
circuit.
the
sole
question
presented
by
our
petition
is
whether
the
comptroller
general
of
the
united
states
in
discharging
the
statutory
responsibility
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
price
charged
the
government
in
a
negotiated
contract
is
authorized
by
law
to
examine
records
of
a
contractor's
unallocated
costs
that
are
an
integral
and
significant
part
of
a
contractor's
business
and
are
defrayed
from
funds
that
include
the
government's
payments
under
the
contract.
the
relevant
facts
are
straightforward
and
uncontested.
in
1973
and
1974
respondent
bristol
laboratories
entered
into
three
contracts
with
the
department
of
defense
and
into
one
contract
with
the
veterans
administration
for
the
sale
of
pharmaceutical
products
to
the
government.
all
four
were
negotiated
fixed
price
contracts
for
the
total
price
of
approximately
$2
million.
as
required
by
10
usc
2313(b)
and
41
usc
254(c)
each
of
the
contracts
contained
a
standard
access-to-records
clause
in
which
respondent
agreed
that
the
comptroller
general
shall
have
access
to
and
right
to
examine
any
directly
pertinent
books
and
records
of
respondent
involving
transactions
related
to
the
contract.
pursuant
to
these
statutory
and
contractual
provisions,
the
comptroller
general
in
august,
1974,
made
a
timely
request
to
respondent
for
access
to
all
books
and
records
directly
pertinent
to
the
contracts,
including
records
of
experienced
costs,
support
for
the
prices
charged
the
government,
and
such
other
information
as
may
be
necessary
for
use
to
review
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
prices,
and
the
adequacy
of
the
protection
afforded
the
government's
interests.
the
comptroller
general
explained
that
gao
was
reviewing
the
increasing
federal
procurement
of
drug
products
and
that
the
requested
records
were
necessary
to
that
review.
respondent
agreed
that
it
was
obligated
to
make
available
certain
of
its
cost
records
but
it
refused
to
produce
the
remainder
of
the
requested
materials.
thereafter,
in
march,
1975,
it
commenced
the
present
action
against
the
comptroller
general
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
united
states
intervened
as
a
defendant
and
filed
a
counterclaim
for
access
to
the
records
sought
by
the
comptroller
general.
following
discovery,
the
district
court
granted
respondent's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
denied
the
government's
cross-motion.
the
court
concluded
that
respondent
had
reasonably
construed
the
access
provisions
by
offering
to
furnish
records
of
its
direct
manufacturing
costs,
manufacturing
overhead,
royalty
expenses,
and
delivery
costs;
all
of
which
respondent
had
allocated
to
individual
products
and
had
expressly
considered
in
setting
its
prices.
the
court
also
agreed
with
respondent
that
the
access
provision
did
not
extend
to
records
concerning
respondent's
costs
of
research
and
development,
advertising
and
promotion,
distribution,
and
administration.
in
addition
the
court
subsequently
granted
respondent's
request
for
a
protective
order
as
agreed
upon
by
the
parties.
on
the
government's
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
for
the
reasons
stated
by
the
district
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
judge
lasker
fundamentally
misconceived
the
question
before
the
court.
we
think
it
is
exclusively
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
first,
it's
clear,
i
believe,
that
the
contractual
provision
that
was
included
in
the
contracts
was
meant
to
be
coterminous
and
synonymous
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute;
the
language
is
virtually
identical
and
no
one
could
have
intended
anything
else.
but,
apart
from
whatever
the
intent
of
the
parties
might
have
been
at
the
time
in
a
contemporaneous
understanding,
apart
from
that
question,
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
law
with
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
governs
this
case
rather
than
the
subjective
intentions
of
the
parties,
and
we
think
that
is
a
statement
of
general
applicability,
as
we
cite
to
professor
corbin
and
others
in
our
reply
brief.
so
the
sole
question
before
the
court,
in
our
view,
is
the
construction
of
the
access-to-records
statutes.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
judge
lasker's
opinion
specifically
declined
to
follow
the
intervening
decisions
of
the
7th
circuit
in
the
eli
lilly
and
abbott
labs
cases
which
had
rejected
the
holding
of
the
district
court
in
the
present
case
and
had
sustained
access
requests
by
gao
that
were
identical
to
the
request
it
made
of
respondent.
accordingly,
the
single
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
the
comptroller
general's
right
of
access
to
records
withheld
by
respondent
pertaining
to
its
costs
of
research
and
development,
advertising
and
promotion,
administration,
and
distribution.
respondent
does
not
dispute
that
these
costs
are
an
integral
and
significant
part
of
its
pharmaceutical
business.
indeed,
it
has
been
generally
estimated
that
indirect
costs
like
these
constitute
as
much
as
91
percent
of
the
price
of
a
drug
product,
and
the
pharmaceutical
companies
spend
approximately
12
percent
of
sales
revenues
on
research
and
development
alone.
it
is
also
clear
that
payments
by
the
government
under
the
contracts
in
question
here
were
used
as
part
of
respondent's
general
revenues
to
defray
these
costs
of
doing
business.
nevertheless,
respondent
contends
the
records
of
these
costs
are
categorically
outside
the
scope
of
the
access
provisions.
although
his
position
is
not
entirely
clear,
respondent
seems
to
advance
two
different
interpretations.
first,
that
access
is
authorized
only
for
records
of
costs
that
are
computed
or
allocated
on
a
product
basis
and
are
expressly
taken
into
account
in
setting
the
prices
for
the
items
sold
to
the
government.
or,
second,
that
the
right
of
access
is
limited
to
records
of
manufacturing
and
other
costs
specifically
incurred
in
performing
the
particular
contracts.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
need
that
information
in
order
to
determine
the
full
costs
of
the
products
that
the
government
bought.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
don't
know
how
much
they
spent
on
it.
if
they
were
able
to
tell
us,
for
example--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i'm
not
aware
that
we
have
even
that
information,
and
if
that
information
were
available--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--subject
to
the
need
to
verify
the
accuracy
of
that
figure
and
any
internal
allocation--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--assuming
that
that's
the
same
relevant
definition
of
research
and
development--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--no,
we
don't--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--what
we're
looking
for
is
defined
by
the
purpose
of
the
statutes,
i
believe.
in
order
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
price
charged
the
government,
it
is
necessary
at
least
in
this
kind
of
a
case
where
respondent
doesn't
fully
allocate
its
costs,
in
order
for
the
comptroller
general
to
construct
a
measure
of
the
aggregate
cost
for
the
items
that
are
sold
the
government.
this
essentially
consists
of
an
effort
to
determine
the
portion
of
the
total
costs
of
respondent's
pharmaceutical
business
that's
assignable
to
the
items
purchased
by
the
government.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
they
don't.
those
unallocated
costs
consist
of--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--because
we
don't
have
a
lump
sum
figure
on
the
totality
of
their
costs.
we
only
have
a
figure
on
certain
select
portions
of
their
costs.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
the
comptroller
general
needs
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
that
price
in
relation
to
the
full
cost.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
care
because
we
need
to
determine
what
the
full
cost
is
of
the
products
we
buy.
if
there
were
some
way
of
determining
from
the
direct
costs,
if
it
were
invariably
true
that
direct
costs
were
always
exactly
10
percent,
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
that
extrapolation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
so.
we
won't
know
what
portion
of
the
remainder
is
attributable
to
other
costs
that
are
fairly
assignable
to
the
cost
of
doing
business.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
they
say
none
of
it
is
allocated,
but
bristol
is
conducting
a
pharmaceutical
business
here.
its
profits
from
the
sales
to
the
government
and
to
other
purchasers
have
to
fund
the
ongoing
expenses
of
general
overhead,
advertising
and
promotion,
and
so
on.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
is.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
right.
if
it
turns
out
that
a
fair
allocation
under
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
shows
that
these
other
costs
of
doing
business
constituted
a
very
small
addition
to
the
direct
manufacturing
costs,
the
difference
between
the
cost
and
the
price
would
be
exorbitant,
the
margin
would
be
unreasonable,
and
gao
could
well
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
congress
or
to
the
procuring
agencies
in
order
to
change
the
way
in
which
the
government
procures
its
pharmaceutical
products.
on
the
other
hand,
if
these
other
costs
of
doing
business
turn
out
to
constitute
most
of
the
price
leaving
a
reasonable
difference
between
the
cost
and
the
price,
then
the
present
system
is
adequate
to
protect
the
government's
interest
and
no
change
may
be
in
order.
but
it's
exactly
to
determine
the
answer
to
that
question
that
it's
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
costs
at
least
here
where
there
is
such
a
large
proportion
of
unallocated
cost,
the
cost,
that
is,
that
bristol
itself
does
not
allocate.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
costs
are
not
attributable
to
this
product
and
all
other
products
and
it's
the
division,
the
allocation
of
those
general
costs
that's
the
burden
of
the
accountants
who've
gone
in
and
looked
at
the
records.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
as
i
understand
it,
they
were
what
are
called
ethical
pharmaceuticals
which
require
a
prescription.
yes,
with
a
doctor's
prescription,
they
were
standard
items.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
it
paid
the
standard
wholesale
price
that
bristol
offers.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
did
not
allege
that
and
we
don't
think
that
access
depends
on
any
antitrust
theory.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
one
purpose
and
it
may
serve...
the
fact
that
this
is
a
standard
item
sold
to
the
public
in
substantial
quantities
gives
some
assurance,
no
question,
that
the
price
was
reasonable.
but
this
access
to
records
statute
gives
us
a
way
of
checking
that
assumption.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
presume
it
is
different
from
those;
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that
is
some
assurance,
but
congress
determined
that
the
market
mechanism
is
not
sufficient
assurance
to
make
sure
that
the
public
funds
were
not
being
unnecessarily
expensed
and
that
the
prices
charged
the
government
were
not
excessive.
there
may
be
a
number
of
reasons
wholly
apart
from
any
antitrust
violation
why
the
prices
charged
the
government
might
be
unreasonable
even
though
they
were
based
on
standard
catalog
price.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
might
be
possible.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly,
because
of
the
government's
unique
position
it
might
be
able
to
better
procurement
techniques
to
obtain
a
price
more
favorable
than
that
customarily
charged
the
general
public.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
do
disagree
with
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it's
hard
for
me
to
identify
document
by
document
since
gao
hasn't
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
study
the
record-keeping
system
of
bristol.
the
actual
audit
that
is
conducted--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--they
did
but
no
inspection
has
yet
occurred,
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
the
actual
audit
to
be
conducted
will
depend
very
heavily
on
the
nature
of
respondent's
record-keeping
system.
it
may
be
the
case,
for
example,
that
the
records
will
show
that
certain
costs
are
exclusively
borne
by
or
can
be
completely
allocated
to
a
non-government
purchaser,
in
which
event
they
would
not
be
assignable
to
the
government
contracts
and
would
not
need
to
be
examined
here
except,
as
i
say,
for
purposes
of
verification.
for
example,
in
the
advertising
category,
if,
bristol
has
a
contract
with
an
advertising
firm
on
a
retainer
basis
or
in
some
other
way,
and
the
firm,
as
it
happens,
advertises
nothing
but
a
certain
product
and
that
product
is
not
one
that
the
government
purchased
under
these
contracts,
then
when
the
auditors
look
at
that
charge
from
the
advertising
company,
that
expense,
and
they
convince
themselves
that
there
is
no
relationship
whatever
to
the
products
that
the
government
purchased,
then
that
cost
would
not
need
to
be
examined
any
further.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
thoroughness
of
the
audit
will
depend
in
large
part
on
the
record-keeping
that
the
respondent
maintains.
we
haven't
seen
that
yet,
and
so
it's
hard
to
know.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
have
not,
as
i
say,
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
so
it's
hard
to
answer
categorically,
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
consistent
with
the
statute
these
entire
categories
of
records
should
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
review,
which
is
the
position
that
the
respondent
takes
here.
we
are
not
at
the
position
in
which
we're
trying
to
decide
whether
a
particular
subclass
of
cost
or
whether
a
particular
document
is
relevant
to
the
inquiry
or
not.
that
will
be
subject
to
the
informal
negotiations
and
give-and-take
of
the
audit
process,
just
as
in
civil
discovery
or
subpoena
demands,
for
example.
the
question
here
is
whether
these
types
of
cost
records
are
to
be
entirely
outside
the
bounds
of
gao--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i'll
confess
it's
hard
to
know
what
congress
had
in
mind,
but,
no,
we--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
because,
first,
i
don't
think
that
the
language
"directly
pertinent",
on
the
face
of
the
statute--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
modifier
"directly"
was
added
as
a
floor
amendment--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
legislative
history
is
very
sparse.
the
amendment
was
proposed
by
representative
hoffman.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
the
word
serves
only
as
one
of
emphasis
to
underscore
to
gao--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
it
wasn't
all
this
trouble.
the
legislative
history
is
as
follows.
the
hardy
amendment,
the
hardy
bill,
which
is
the
principal
basis
for
the
statutes,
included
the
requirement
that
the
records
be
pertinent.
on
the
floor
of
the
house
the
word
"directly"
was
added
as
a
floor
amendment
by
representative
hoffman.
there
was
no
discussion
or
debate
upon
that
provision.
it
was
an
amendment
to
which
representative
hardy
did
not
disagree;
he
was
fully
willing
to
accept
it.
and
it
followed
closely
the
rejection
of
another
amendment
offered
by
representative
harvey
that
sought
to
accomplish
a
significant
narrowing
of
the
statute
in
much
the
same
way
the
respondent
urges
here.
that
amendment
was
opposed
by
representative
hardy
and
it
was
defeated
by
a
voice
vote
in
the
house.
so
we
think,
in
those
circumstances,
the
addition,
the
inclusion
of
the
modifier
directly
in
front
of
"pertinent"
does
not
indicate
that
congress
had
in
mind
any
significant
different
purpose
or
any
difference
in
character
than
the
bill
that
was
originally
introduced
by
representative
hardy.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
its
purpose
there
was
simply
to
emphasize
to
gao
that
it
should
have
a
legitimate
need
before
undertaking
examination
of
a
contractor's
records
and
should
not,
in
the
language
of
the
representative
introducing
the
amendment,
should
not
go
"snooping"
without
reason.
we
think
that
purpose
in
all
probability
would
have
been
adequately
served
by
the
word
"pertinent".
but
congress,
to
make
sure
that
message
was
clear
to
gao
and
recognizing
the
likely
objections
by
the
business
community,
added
the
modifier
to
emphasize
the
point.
we
don't
think
it
changes
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
a
significant
way,
as
i
say.
representative
hardy
was
fully
amenable
to
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
what
has
happened
here
is
we've
brought
lawsuits,
or
where
a
drug
company
is
involved--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
in
one
or
two
cases
we
commenced
litigation
and
in
the
others
the
drug
companies
did.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
usually
to
seek
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
either
to
enforce
our
rights
under
the
contracting
statute
or
to
prevent
gao's
inspection.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
would
initiate
litigation.
if
we
prevailed--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--oh,
i
fully
believe
so
if
they
violated
a
court
order
that
construes
the
statutes
in
accordance
with
our--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--yes,
and
if
we
prevailed,
then
we
would
have
a
court
order
that
could
be
enforced.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
language
of
the
statutes,
the
legislative
history,
and
it
would
be
based
on
gao's
legal
right
to
review
these
records
in
order
to
determine
the
government
procurement
system
is
working
efficiently
and
economically
in
its
expenditure
of
public
funds.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
must
say
i
don't
know
what
the
authority
of
the
fbi
is.
we're
concerned
here
only
with
gao's
authority.
if
there
were
some
legitimate
reason
to
suspect
criminal
activity
or
something
else--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--something
within
the
legitimate
domain
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
this
were
a
claim
that
were
subject
to
renegotiation
and
if
that's
a
proper
purpose
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
certainly
they
could
investigate
it.
but
what
congress
did
here
was
add
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
believe
the
court
could
take
notice
of
the
function
of
the
agency.
i
believe
that's
correct
but
what
congress
said
here
is
that
it
specifically
delegated
to
gao
as
its
arm...
gao
is
a
body
under
the
control
of
congress
rather
than
the
executive
branch...
and
it
vested
special
authority
in
the
comptroller
general
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
price
in
negotiated
contracts
and
to
assess
the
adequacy
of
the
protection
afforded
the
government's
interest.
congress
has
always
been
concerned
and
its
concern
is
manifested
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
negotiated
contracts
require
close
supervision
and
control.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
this
case
the
contracts
are
not
subject
to
the
renegotiation
act,
which
in
any
event
has
now
expired.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
prospectively,
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
we
have
a
right
even
as
to
contracts
that
are
in
existence
now
and
have
been
previously
executed,
and
i
thought
that
was
the
question
mr.
justice
marshall
was
addressing
to
me.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
think
at
all
that
this
is
black-listing.
if
congress
had
required
that
a
provision
be
included
in
a
contract
and
a
contractor
refuses
to
accede
to
that,
to
adhere
to
that
congressional
requirement,
i
think
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
gao,
the
procuring
agency,
not
to
enter
into
any
further
contracts
with
that
contractor.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
in
this
case,
as
i
say,
these
contracts
are
not
subject
to
the
renegotiation
act
which
expired
in
1976,
in
any
event.
but
if
a
25
percent
excessive
pricing
here
was
on
a
base
of
five
or
ten
cents
and
represented
a
250
percent
markup
or
excessive
profit,
that
could
well
be
the
basis
for
recommendations
to
the
procuring
agencies
or
to
congress
itself
for
changes
in
the
procurement
process.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
not
for
the
previously
expended
monies.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is
no
constitutional
question,
as
i
say,
i
believe
it's
solely
a
statutory
question.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
a
public
company
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes.
i
know
they
have
10-k's
and
other
registration
statements,
that
sort
of
thing.
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
respondent
in
this
case,
bristol
laboratories,
is
an
unincorporated
division
of
bristol-myers
corporation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly,
but
bristol-myers
is
the
parent
of
the
unincorporated
division
and
is
a
publicly
registered
corporation.
the
courts
of
appeals
prior
to
this
case
in
the
hewlett-packard
and
eli
lilly
decisions
have
construed
the
legislative
history
of
the
access
statutes
to
which
i
referred
a
moment
ago
to
effectuate
the
congressional
intent
of
permitting
the
comptroller
general
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
price
and
the
adequacy
of
the
protection
afforded
the
government's
interests.
these
courts
recognized
that
congress
intended
an
inquiry
by
the
comptroller
general
into
whether
costs
are
excessive
in
that
if
the
costs
were
out
of
line
with
the
contract
price,
the
comptroller
general
could
recommend
other
methods
of
meeting
future
procurement
needs.
in
the
same
way,
virtually
all
commentators
have
recognized
that
the
broad
remedial
rights
that
the
access
provisions
vest
in
the
comptroller
general
to
evaluate
the
economy
and
efficiency
of
negotiated
procurements.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sure
a
committee
of
congress
could
do
that.
we
think
the
statute
here
has
authorized
gao
to
do
much
the
same
thing.
it
may
turn
out
to
be
the
case
in
some
or
many
of
these
instances
that
the
comptroller
general
concludes
that
the
price
charged
was
reasonable.
it
may
turn
out
that
that's
not
the
case.
we
simply
don't
know.
and
without
that
information
it's
not
possible
to
propose
or
to
adopt
changes
in
the
procurement
system
that
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
government's
legitimate
interest.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
make
changes
in
the
procurement
system
that
are
unnecessary
to
address
any
real
problem,
we
may
add
increased
burden
and
expense
and
delay
to
the
procurement
process.
in
other
words,
it's
only
by
having
full
access
to
the
information
that
congress
envisioned
when
it
enacted
the
access
statutes
that
the
comptroller
general
can
fulfill
the
congressional
objective
to
promote
efficient
and
effective
procurement
techniques
by
the
government.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
we
think
that
wording
in
the
statute--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
think
that
would
be
at
all
necessary.
as
i
say,
it's
difficult
for--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
i
can.
first,
let
me
emphasize
that
this
is
limited
to
respondent's
domestic
ethical
pharmaceutical
business,
and
not
any
other
businesses
he
engages
in
such
as
veterinary
products
or
other
things.
second,
we're
seeking
here--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--then
there
would
be
an
allocation
of
the
total
pool.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
they
say
they're
unable
to
allocate
it?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
okay.
if
they
don't
but
they
could
and
we
were--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
would
accept
that
allocation
subject
to
verification--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--if
it
were
necessary
to
do
that--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--only
if
it's
necessary
to
verify
the
information
that
we
have
been
otherwise
provided.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
then
we
would
take
a
look
at
the
total
for
all
and
allocate
the
portion
that's
representative
to
the
pharmaceutical
industry.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
consultations,
as
gao
always
does
in
accordance
with
standard
practice,
with
the
respondent--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--yes,
they
were
a
part
of
that
same
common
statute
that
were
enacted
at
the
same
time.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
are
you
asking
how
bristol
has
held--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--that's
right,
and
that's
exactly
the
reason
why
an
allocation
is
necessary.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
records
in
question
here
would
only
relate
to
the
period
when
the
contracts
were
in
question.
and
when
respondent
incurred
the
cost
of
performance,
not
20
years
ago.
but
beyond
that,
the
allocation
could
be
done
in
several
ways
consistent
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
it
could
be
done
on
the
basis
of
net
sales,
it
could
be
done
on
the
basis
of
gross
sales,
it
could
be
done
on
the
basis
of
square
footage
of
research
space,
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
do
it.
but
that's
essentially
an
accounting
problem
that
will
be
worked
out
in
consultation
with
the
contractor
in
each
individual
case.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
accordance
with
established
accounting
principles.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
are,
and
that's
why
we
need
to
discuss
it
fully
with
the
contractor
and--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
think
there
is
the
limitation.
we've
limited
ourselves
to
cost
and
pricing
records,
we
haven't
asked
to
see
any
of
the
vast
categories
of
other
kinds
of
documents
that
a
large
corporation
invariably
maintains.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
it
does.
the
limit
is
set
by
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry.
the
purpose
is
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
price.
the
application
of
that
general
standard,
that
invarying
standard,
will
depend
on
the
record-keeping
system
of
the
contractor
in
each
case.
if
for
example
bristol
had
fully
allocated
all
of
its
costs
of
doing
business
and
could
say
that
the
cost
of
selling
products
to
the
government
were
x
amount,
10
cents
a
pill,
and
we
spot
check
that
on
one
or
two
items
to
make
sure
these
figures
are
accurate
and
they
told
us
their
accounting
method,
we
would
say,
thank
you,
very
much,
and
we
would
leave,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
we
have
reasons
to
suspect
it
then--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--only
if
there's
some
question
about
it.
if
bristol
acts
in
a
good
faith
manner,
as
we
fully
expect
him
to
do,
then
we
think
it
would
be
limited
to
a
spot
check
and
verification
of
selected
items
with
an
explanation
of
their
accounting
practices.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
in
the
end
that's
a
question
of
law
that
the
court
would
decide.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
worked
out
in
an
informal
negotiation
procedure,
as
it
is
in
civil
discovery
or
subpoena
requests.
it
depends
on
each
individual
case.
if
the
negotiations
come
to
impasse
it
will
be
brought
to
litigation
and
the
district
judge
will
decide.
but
we
think
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
application
that
should
be
left
open
and
these
categories
of
records
shouldn't
be
absolutely
excluded
from
review
by
the
comptroller
general
as
respondent
proposes.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
certainly,
and
that
happens
all
the
time
in
cost-based
contracts
where
the
contractor
seeks
reimbursement
on
the
basis
of
his
costs
allocable
to
the
government's
contract.
no
different
methodology
is
required
here
simply
because
it's
gao
rather
than
the
contractor
that
seeks
to
do
the
accounting
technique.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
exactly,
although
my
understanding
there
was
that
it
was
not
done
on
a
contract
basis
as
we
would
do
here
but
it
was
done
on
a
broad
or
corporate
basis,
but
i
think
in
principle
it's
much
the
same.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
it's
incontrovertible
that
the
government's
payments...
that
the
research
and
development
expenses
incurred
at
the
relevant
time
were
borne
by
the
government--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--what
they
say
is
that
they
didn't
expressly
consider
them
in
setting
the
prices
in
the
day
and
their
business
practices
don't
allocate
them.
i
think
they
recognized
though
that
the
government's
payments
as
part
of
their
general
revenues
are
used
to
defray
all
their
overhead
expenses
of
the
relevant
period.
there's
no
doubt
that
a
part
of
this
commingled
general
revenue
is
our
money
and
other
purchasers'
money
was
used
to
pay
the
costs
of
research
and
development,
advertising
and
promotion,
and
the
rest.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that
the
respondent
concedes
that
if
this
were
a
cost-based
contract,
we
would
be
entitled
to
audit
the
records
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
reimbursement
was
properly
charged.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
we
would
make
sure--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
it's
inconceivable
that
in
claiming
reimbursement
on
any
cost-based--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--if
they
elect
to
forego
reimbursement
for
those
costs
in
a
cost-based
contract--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--we
wish
them
well
in
that
endeavor,
then,
but
when
it's
the
government's
interest
that
is
being
protected
by
the
comptroller
general's
investigation,
we
think
that
their
decision
on
what
they
do
with
cost-based
contracts
is
not
controlling.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
the
ambiguity
is
where
you
say,
"entered
into
the
price
charged
the
government.
"
bristol
recovers
its
costs
of
doing
business
from
its
sales,
including
its
sales
to
the
government.
in
that
sense,
in
the
sense
that
the
government's
payments
were
used
to
bear
these
expenses,
it
did
enter
into
the
price.
on
the
other
hand,
bristol
never
sat
down
and
said,
we
need
to
charge
72
cents
a
pill
in
order
to
recover
research
and
development
costs
of
$100
million
a
year.
in
that
sense
they
never
expressly
considered,
just
as
in
hewlett-packard
or
eli
lilly
it
was
never
consciously
considered
expressly
and
exclusively
in
reaching
a
pricing
decision.
