mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
direct
appeal
alleging
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
texas
probation
statute
under
the
provisions
of
the
decisions
in
morrissey
v.
brewer
and
gagnon
v.
scarpelli,
insofar
as
they
relate
to
the
revocation
of
probation.
the
issue
in
this
case:
was
danny
vincent
denied
due
process
of
law
by
reason
of
the
failure
of
the
state
of
texas
to
grant
him
a
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
probable
cause
as
soon
as
reasonably
possible
after
his
arrest?
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
first
instance,
the
state
is
alleging
that
the
subsequent
events
were
these:
number
one,
he
admitted
to
the
arresting
officer
that
he
was
driving
while
intoxicated
and
that
was
a
sufficient
admission
of
a
crime
under
the
state
of
texas
which
was
a
violation
of
his
probation,
therefore
obviating
the
necessity
for
a
preliminary
hearing
as
to
due
cause.
secondly,
he
so
admitted
to
his
probation
officer
at
the
time
and
immediately
after
his
arrest,
and
the
probation
officer
observed
him
in
an
intoxicated
state
and
concluded
from
that
that
he
had
violated
his
probation
conditions.
and
third,
that
he
was
afforded
a
full
blown,
evidentiary
judicial
hearing
at
which
the
court
found
that
he
had
violated
his
probation
and
that
he
had
admitted
on
the
stand
that
he
so
violated
it.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
hold
him
and
whether
this
court
should
either
send
it
back
for
that
hearing,
i
would
probably
concede,
although
that's
what
this
court
did
in
gagnon
v.
scarpelli,
that
that
would
be
an
irrelevant
and
useless
situation.
i
think
the
court
is
faced
with
this
situation
of
evidence.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
have
also
asked
the
court
to
in
essence
dismiss
the
probation
proceedings.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
texas
for
the
past
eight
years
has
consistently
refused
to
apply
the
mandates
of
this
court
in
due
process
hearing.
in
other
words
he
is
now
a
person
with
a
right,
i
contend,
without
a
remedy.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
not
the
second
stage
hearing
which
this
court
talked
about,
the
full
blown
hearing;
there
was
no
complaint
at
that
hearing.
we
did
make--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--no,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
but
we
haven't
complained
about
it.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
in
terms
of
what
it
would
actually
do,
what
would
happen
is,
if
you
remanded
it
for
that
probable
cause
hearing,
they
would
put
on
the
same
evidence
that
was
at
the
full
blown
hearing,
they
would
conclude
there
was
probable
cause,
and
you'd
have
the
hearing.
so
the
practical
effect
would
be
the
same.
but
the
constitutional
effect
is
that
he
has
been
denied
at
the
time--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--well,
the
practical
effect
is,
at
the
time
that
he
was
arrested
and
at
the
time
from
that
point
until
he
had
a
counsel
appointed
and
was
out
on
bail,
he
was
held
without
a
determination
of
probable
cause
under
this
court's
mandates.
sure,
looking
back
on
it
now,
after
two
years
of
history,
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
that
this
court
can
do
to
rectify
that
violation
of
his
probable
cause.
i
think
the
court
recognized
that
in
gerstein
v.
pugh.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
no.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
exactly.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
the
fact
of
probable
cause
was
never
attacked.
the
fact
of
denying
the
hearing
was
attacked.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
gerstein
v.
pugh,
the
only
way
that
comes
in
is,
what
do
you
do
with
a
conviction
which
is
based
upon
an
improper
detention
or
an
arrest
without
probable
cause?
and
that
has
told
me
that
this
court
up
to
now
has
said,
we
are
not
going
to
void
that
conviction.
however,
there
have
been
cases
in
the
lower
courts--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
not
on
this
particular
violation,
no.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
if
that
conviction--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--i
think
it
would
be;
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
think
in
this
situation
that
would
be
the
logical
conclusion
of
what
this
court
would
say,
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
no.
it
isn't.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
and
it
was
a
class
action.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
would
be
satisfied
with
my
client,
first
of
all,
having
his
probation
revocation
voided,
and
secondly,
if
this
court
decides
from
that
point
on
that
it
applies
only
to
probation
revocations
which
are
on
appeal
currently
in
texas
plus
in
the
future,
my
client
would
have
no
reason
not
to
accept
that
ruling.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
he'd
won
the
battle
but
maybe
lost
the
war.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
no.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
that
peppercorn
might
give
mr.
vincent
some
moral
satisfaction.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
but
i
think
the
state
argues,
and
depending
on
how
this
court
handles
the
question
of
prospectivity,
for
example--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--i
think
it's
the
function
of
this
court
to
enforce
the
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
and
grant
significant
relief
insofar
as
mr.
vincent
is
concerned,
and
i
think
in
terms
of
whether
it's
prospective
or
not,
we're
not
talking
about
a
situation
like
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
or
morrissey
v.
brewer.
those
cases
have
been
on
the
books
for
eight
years,
and
the
texas
supreme
court
has
had
three
prior
times
to
consider
those,
and
in
each
case...
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals...
and
in
each
case
it
said,
no,
it
does
not
apply,
and
we
are
not
going
to
follow
it.
and
so
it's
not
a
situation
of
this
court
pronouncing
some
new
constitutional
law.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
they
simply
said
that
in
this
case,
that
mr.
vincent's
position
has
been
adversely
decided
against
him
in
a
prior
case
and
cited
the
whisenant
v.
state
case.
that's
all
they
said.
it
was
a
per
curiam
decision
without--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--in
the
whisenant
case
they
said
that
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
does
not
apply
to
texas
probation
revocation
proceedings
for
several
reasons:
number
one,
we
made
the
distinction
earlier
between
the
suspension
of
imposition
of
sentence
and
the
suspension
of
execution;
number
two,
texas
procedure
provides
more
due
process
than
gagnon
v.
scarpelli;
and
third,
that
the
probationer
is
entitled
to
a
mandatory
20-day
hearing,
and
that
obviates
the
necessity,
they
believed,
for
a
preliminary
determination
from
appellants.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
that's
correct.
but
it's
not...
because
i
understood
that--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--i
understood
that
that
motion
had
been
already
overruled
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
that
was
my
understanding
from
co
counsel.
i
had
not
intended
to
talk--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
of
analysis,
in
looking
at
the
state's
position
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
position,
when
this
court
made
the
pronouncements
in
morrissey
and
scarpelli,
they
were
talking
about...
you
were
talking
about--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--minimum
requirements...
yes?
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
as
i
understood
it,
you're
talking
about
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
escape?
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
as
opposed
to
the
original
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
was
informed
by
counsel
for
the
state
this
morning.
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that,
that
that
motion
on
escape,
which
was
filed
last
week
or
so,
had
already
been
overruled
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
all
i
was
told,
that
it
had
been
overruled.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
well,
i
understood
that
the
motion
that
was
postponed
to
the
merits
was
the
original
motion
to
dismiss
that
was
filed
right
after
i--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--all
right.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
my
client
is
in
the
correctional
facility
in
the
state
of
colorado.
he
has
been
later
subsequently
convicted
of
forgery
charges.
the
appendix
set
forth
in
the
state's
motion
to
dismiss
is
substantially
correct
as
to
what
happened.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
right
after
i
received
the
state's
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
escape.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
the
state
would
have
this
court
focus
on...
and
i
think
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
focused
on
the
second
stage
in
a
probation
revocation
case,
and
that
is
the
determination
of
whether
to
revoke.
the
state
has
not
addressed
nor
has
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
addressed
the
first
stage,
that
is,
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
to
determine
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
the
officer
made
that
determination
as
he
must
do
in
all
situations
for
arrest.
that,
i
don't
think,
is
what
this
court
was
talking
about
in
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
and
morrissey
v.
brewer.
you
were
talking
about
a
disinterested
person.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
well,
he
admitted
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
that
he
was
on
probation.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
well,
he
was
clearly
driving
the
car.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
because,
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
said,
one
of
the
purposes
of
that
preliminary
hearing
is
not
only
to
determine
probable
cause
but
to--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--but,
number
one,
he
was
intoxicated
when
he
made
that
admission.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
when
i
put
him
on
the
stand
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
drinking
beer
seven
or
eight
hours
earlier.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
it
seems
to
me,
though,
that
what
this
court...
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
that
you're
looking
at
a
later
determination
of
the
merits
to
decide
whether
you
filed...
should
or
should
not
have
followed
due
process
grounds
earlier
in
the
case.
and
you
can
never
know
that,
and
a
person
can
be
incarcerated
for
a
substantial
length
of
time
without
the
disinterested
determination
that
this
court
set
forth
as
one
of
the
minimum
requirements
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
would
agree
with
that
statement.
there
was
no
concrete
conscious
controversy
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
reason
to
have
a
hearing
for
a
fact
which
may
not
be
in
dispute
and
that
is
that
in
order
to
set
a
procedure,
a
constitutional
procedure
under
that
statute,
which
for
seven
years
the
court
had
said
it
did
not
have
to
follow,
that
even
though
he
may
have
admitted
it
at
the
time
he
is
still
entitled
to
that
hearing,
to
have
the
evidence
presented
against
him,
the
witnesses
told
to
him,
and
a
chance
to
speak.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
not
in
a
civil
case.
that's
governed
by
local
procedures,
whether
that's
an
admission
or
whether
that's
a
concrete
evidentiary
fact,
or
as
to
how
it
can
be
used
at
trial.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
there
is
no
dispute
now
as
to
the
fact,
there
probably
was
not
a
dispute
at
the
time,
but
the
fact
is
that
he
was
not
afforded
those
minimum
due
process
rights
which
i
do
not
understand
to
be
dependent
on
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent.
if
he
was
guilty
we
don't
need
a
later
revocation
hearing
on
the
fact
of
his
guilt
except
for
determining
whether
he
should
be
revoked
or
not.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
your
honor,
number
one,
it's
not
purely
academic.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
no.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
but
i
think
you
are
in
essence,
you
are
establishing
a
procedure
in
morrissey--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--and
you've
established
it
in
gagnon
v.
scarpelli.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
texas
courts
have
not
been
following
that
procedure.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
insofar
as
it
related
to
my
client,
yes.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
insofar
as
my
client
is
concerned,
i
cannot
probably
accomplish
any
more
than
was
accomplished
in
gagnon
v.
scarpelli.
and
in
that
case
the
person
in
scarpelli
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
a
burglary,
as
i
recall.
and
under
the
evidence
of
one
of
the
probation
officers
he
supposedly
had
admitted
it,
although
he
later
revoked
that
under
grounds
of
fraud
and
duress.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
morrissey
v.
brewer.
there
were
elements
of
admissions
in
both
of
those
cases.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
it
could
be
a
disinterested--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--but
that
was
not
a
disinterested
probation
officer.
that
was
the
probation
officer
that
made
the
decision
to
revoke.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
i
would
think
he
concluded
that
under
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
that
was
all
he
had
to
do,
was
to
get
the
county
attorney
to
file
a
motion
and
have
the
probation
started.
and
under
the
state
of
texas
law
at
that
time,
i
think
he
was
right.
and
the
only
question
is
whether
that's
constitutionally
permissible.
i
would
like
to
reserve,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
one
brief
point,
your
honor.
i
don't
want
this
court
to
leave
with
the
impression
that
in
all
probation
revocation
cases
the
only
way
to
get
the
probationer
into
court
is
on
an
arrest
warrant
with
a
predetermination
by
a
judicial
magistrate
for
probable
cause.
section
8(a)
says,
"at
any
time
during
the
period
of
probation
the
court
may
issue
a
warrant
for
violation
of
any
of
the
conditions
of
the
probation
and
cause
the
defendant
to
be
arrested.
"
"it
then
says,
any
probation
officer,
police
officer,
or
other
officer
with
power
of
arrest
may
arrest
such
defendant
without
a
warrant
upon
the
order
of
the
judge
of
such
court
to
be
noted
on
the
docket
of
the
court.
"
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
order
of
the
court.
but
that--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--if
it's
done
in
the
ordinary
sense
that
we
think
of
an
arrest
warrant
being
done,
that
is,
upon
an
affidavit
with
the
information--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--i
understand,
but
they
also
may
on
arrest
warrants
under
texas
procedure.
they
have
to
be
made
on
a
sworn
complaint
or
other
affidavit
and
then
the
arrest
warrant
can
issue.
here
there
was
nothing
more
than
the
probation
officer
telling
the
judge,
danny
vincent
was
d.w.i.
i
want
him
brought
before
the
court.
the
court
considered
that
and
ordered
a
warrant.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
it
is
not.
the
only
thing
in
the
record--
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
--the
only
thing
we
know
is
what
the
order
says.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
that's
right.
mr.
robert
d.
mccutcheon
that's
correct.
i
just
didn't

of
situation.
i
have
nothing
further.
