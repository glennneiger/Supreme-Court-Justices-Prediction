justice
white
and
did
he
admit
on
the
stand
also
that
he
had
on
the
spot
conceded
he
was
intoxicated?
justice
white
at
the
full
hearing
did
it
come
out,
what
he
had
said
before?
justice
white
you're
not
saying,
rectify
the
probable
cause?
justice
white
to
rectify
the
lack
of
a
probable
cause
hearing?
justice
white
there
certainly
was
probable
cause.
justice
white
but
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
if
it
were
simply
announced
that
dispensing
with
the
first
hearing
was
not
testified
in
this
case
but
that
no
relief
flows
from
that,
you
would
be
sort
of
like
gagnon.
at
least
the
law
would
be
established.
to
the
extent
that
you
say
texas
just
isn't
obeying
this,
why
there
would
be
at
least
a
statement
from
this
court
that
it
isn't.
but
your
client
would
wonder
if
he'd
won
his
case
or
not.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know;
you
might...
this
is
not
a
1983
suit,
is
it?
justice
white
but
if
you
had
waited
and
filed
a
1983
suit
and
said
i
want
some
damages
even
if
it's
a
peppercorn,
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
i
was
wronged,
and
i
want
damages,
and
i
should
get
a
penny
at
least.
justice
white
well,
at
least
it
would
be
a--
justice
white
did
they
say
that
in
here?
did
they
say
that
here?
justice
white
and
what
did
they
say
in
the
prior
case?
justice
white
we
postponed
it
to
the
merits.
that
had
been
my
recollection
but
i
was--
justice
white
--the
motion
was
denied,
we're
informed.
you're
correct.
justice
white
where
is
your
client?
justice
white
and
that
he
had
admitted
it
before?
justice
white
but
at
that
point,
mr.
becker,
in
order
to
take
him
into
custody
and
start
the
revocation
proceeding,
doesn't
the
officer
have
to
make
a
motion?
justice
white
where
does
he
file
it?
justice
white
and
who
acts
on
it?
justice
white
i
know,
but
who
acts
on
it?
justice
white
and
the
warrant
doesn't
issue
until
a
judge
acts?
justice
white
and
what's
attached
to
the
motion?
justice
white
is
there
an
affidavit?
justice
white
it's
signed
by
him
but
not
by
a
lawyer?
justice
white
are
you
suggesting,
or
should
you
suggest,
that
whatever
reliability
factor
the
initial
hearing
in
morrissey
was
supposed
to
require
is
in
a
sense
made
up
for
by
this
necessity
of
filing
a
motion
in
court?
justice
white
is
this
similar
to
the
probable
cause
hearing
that's
necessary
or
equivalent
to
what's
necessary
in
gagnon
to
assure
compliance?
justice
white
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
that
morrissey
inevitably
requires
the
presence
of
the
accused
at
the
first
hearing?
justice
white
oh,
i
know
you'd
be
glad--
justice
white
--but
it's
really
just
that
it's
in
order
to
have
a
fairly
reliable
probable
cause
determination,
isn't
it?
justice
white
but
you
could
arrest,
you
could
have
people
arrested
and
incarcerated
on
an
ex
parte
proceeding
under
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
white
and
so,
you're
saying
that
this
is
as
reliable
as
that,
anyway.
justice
white
you
file
a
motion
and
the
judge
acts
on
it
and
issues
a
warrant.
justice
white
well,
it's
upon
the
order
of.
justice
white
that's
a
considerably
different
kettle
of
fish
than
having
the
decision
to
arrest
made
by
an
officer
of
the
law
independently
of
the
court.
justice
white
arrests
are
made
on
warrants
that
are
issued
ex
parte
all
the
time.
justice
white
is
that
interchange
between
the
probation
officer
and
the
judge
in
the
record?
justice
white
how
do
we
know
what
happened
between
them?
justice
white
at
least
it's
perfectly
clear,
though,
that
the
probation
officer
did
not
act
on
his
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
morrissey
the
question
was
whether
if
you're
going
to
administratively
detain
a
man
and
make
the
administrative
determination,
and
bind
him
over,
you're
going
to
have
to
have
whatever
morrissey
said.
but
here
the
probation
officer
went
to
court.
