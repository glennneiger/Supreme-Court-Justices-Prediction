justice
stewart
mr.
mccutcheon,
according
to
my
recollection
there
was
recently
filed
in
this
case
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
based
upon
the
proposition
that
your
client
had
escaped
before
his
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas,
and
that
therefore
that
court
didn't
have
any
jurisdiction
and
that
we
don't.
are
you
going
to
address
yourself,
before
you
sit
down,
to
that
motion?
am
i
right
in
recollecting
that
we
postponed
consideration
of
that
motion--
justice
stewart
--to
the
hearing
on
the
matter?
justice
stewart
oh,
i
see.
then
i
was
wrong.
justice
stewart
no,
no,
this
is
a
motion
based
on
his
escape,
on
his
alleged
escape.
justice
stewart
what
admissions
if
any
did
your
client
make
at
that
time?
justice
stewart
and
even
that
he
was
driving?
justice
stewart
well,
that's
clear.
justice
stewart
so
it
was
a
clear
violation
of
his
probation,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
by
his
own
admission?
justice
stewart
and
presumably
was
issued
only
upon
probable
cause?
justice
stewart
although
it
doesn't
so
recite,
does
it?
justice
stewart
should
be
issued
for
the
arrest
of
the
said
appellant.
justice
stewart
it
was
a
burglary,
which
was--
justice
stewart
--original
conviction?
justice
stewart
in
another
state.
