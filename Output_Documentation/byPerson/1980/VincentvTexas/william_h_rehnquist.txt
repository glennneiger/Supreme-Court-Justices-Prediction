justice
rehnquist
well,
what
then
can
we
do
for
your
client?
we
can't
add
20
days
to
his
life,
presumably.
justice
rehnquist
is
this
a
class
action?
justice
rehnquist
and
gerstein
v.
pugh
was
an
appeal
by
the
tate
from
an
opinion
of
the
three
judge
district
court,
was
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
when
was
your
last
communication
with
him?
justice
rehnquist
this
recent
one?
justice
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
probation
to
obey
all
the
laws?
justice
rehnquist
and
he
was
picked
up
for
drunken
driving?
justice
rehnquist
and
didn't
either
the
arresting
officer
or...
i
forget
if
he
was
taken
before
a
magistrate
or
not...
find
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
for
drunken
driving?
justice
rehnquist
but
we
decide
specific
concrete
controversies
here,
and
in
this
case
certainly
there
is
some
sense
that
there
wasn't
a
concrete
controversy
as
to
whether
your
client
at
the
initial
stage
had
violated
parole.
justice
rehnquist
then,
why
haven't
all
of
his
rights
been
fulfilled
by
the
state
of
texas?
certainly
there's
no
reason
to
have
a
hearing
about
a
fact
which
is
not
in
dispute,
is
there?
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
in
a
civil
case
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
the
defendant
was
at
the
intersection
of
high
and
broad
in
columbus,
ohio,
at
12
noon
on
such
and
such
a
day,
and
the
defendant
admits
it,
do
you
think
that
either
party
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that?
justice
rehnquist
but
isn't
yours
very
much
the
same,
that
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact
on
which
you
want
a
hearing?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
becker,
you
mention
on
page
11
of
your
brief
the
case
of
escoe
v.
zerbst,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1935,
which
characterized
probation
as
an
act
of
grace.
do
you
suggest
by
that
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
texas
courts
were
at
least
entitled
to
rely
on
that
up
until
the
time
morrissey
v.
brewer
came
down,
and
they
felt
they
were
according
the
parolee
more
rights
than
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
accorded
him?
