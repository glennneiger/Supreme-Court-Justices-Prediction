justice
stevens
mr.
becker,
may
i
see
if
i
can
restate
your
argument
as
i
understand
the
thrust
of
it?
you're
saying
in
effect
that
the
morrissey
v.
brewer
procedures
are
an
appropriate
remedy
to
apply
to
a
state
which
has
previously
had
unconstitutional
procedures.
but
the
texas
procedures
have
always
comported
with
due
process
of
law
so
there's
no
reason
to
tamper
with
them
at
all?
justice
stevens
right.
and
then
when
you
do
you
find
that
there's
no
constitutional
violation
in
the
way
you
go
about
revoking
parole,
so
there's
no
need
to
follow
a
procedure
that
was
tailored
for
a
state
that
had
violated
the
constitution
up
to
that
time?
justice
stevens
mr.
becker,
can
i
just
ask
one
more
question?
the
one
flaw
that
occurs
to
me
in
your
argument
is
the
fact
that
i
think
you
rely
heavily
on
the
probationer's
right
to
a
prompt
hearing,
if
he
makes
a
demand.
but
as
i
remember,
you
don't
provide
any
way
of
letting
him
know
he
has
that
right.
how
do
you
defend
that?
