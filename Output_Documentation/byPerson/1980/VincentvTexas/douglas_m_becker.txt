mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
under
gerstein
v.
pugh,
and
the
other
cases,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
possibility
of
this
court
giving
any
relief
whatsoever
to
the
petitioner.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he's
received
a
determination
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
on
at
least
three
different
occasions,
varying
in
reliability.
first,
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
when
he
was
arrested
while
driving
and
in
an
intoxicated
state,
he
admitted,
the
arresting
officer
determined
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
now
there
was
an
impression
perhaps
left
that
he
later
stated
that
he
had
been
drinking
eight
hours
earlier.
actually,
he
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing...
it
was
quite
clear
at
the
final
revocation
hearing
that
he
had
been
drinking
for
seven
or
eight
hours,
and
he
stated,
i
took
my
first
drink
eight
hours
ago,
and
admitted
that
he
had
been
drinking
wine,
beer,
and
schnapps.
now,
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest
he
didn't
go
into
that
detail
as
to
exactly
what
liquors
he
had
been
drinking
but
he
did
admit
that
he
was
drunk
to
the
officer,
who
had
stopped
him
under
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
driving
his
car
in
irregular
manner
and
in
which
he
observed
him
in
what
he
believed
to
be
an
intoxicated
state.
not
only
did
the
arresting
officer
believe
there
was
probable
cause
but
the
arresting
officer
immediately
called
the
man's
probation
officer
who
met
them
at
the
jail.
at
the
jail
they
had
conversations
with
him
after
giving
him
miranda
warnings
for
i
believe
45
minutes,
the
record
reflects,
and
the
probation
officer
testified
at
the
revocation
hearing,
no
doubt
that
the
man
was
drunk;
he
made
no
bones
about
the
fact
that
he
was
drunk.
the
probation
officer
testified
that
the
reason
he
had
come
to
the
jail
was
because
the
police
officer
had
called
him
to
do
so.
all
right,
now,
all
this
occurred
on
february
3.
the
record
apparently
reflects
that
mr.
vincent
was
allowed
to
go
home
for
the
weekend
because
on
february
6
there
was
an
arrest
warrant
obtained.
it
appears
on
page
18
of
the
appendix
and
differentiates
this
case
from
gerstein
v.
pugh,
and
from
morrissey
and
from
gagnon
v.
scarpelli.
on
the
6th
the
arresting
officer
and
the
probation
officer
went
to
the
magistrate,
to
the
judge,
and
told
him
what
had
happened
and
presented
evidence
to
him.
and
he
issued
an
arrest
warrant
which
recited,
having
heard
and
considered
the
evidence
offered
by
the
state
in
support
thereof.
that
was
an
ex
parte
proceeding
but
nevertheless
it
constituted
judicial
review
of
the
decision
to
arrest.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
no,
your
honor.
it
recites,
"having
heard
and
considered
the
evidence
offered
by
the
state,
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
a
warrant--
"
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
that's
right.
and
the
record
contains
the
copies
to
the
sheriff.
the
sheriff
went
out
and
arrested
danny
vincent
on
the
6th.
he
was
returned
to
jail
on
that
date.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes?
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
your
honor,
because
under
texas
law
probable
cause
is
required
for
an
arrest
warrant
to
arrest
for
a
motion
to
revoke
probation,
same
as
in
any
other
circumstances.
all
of
the
laws
of
arrest
apply
to
probationers
in
texas,
equally
to
persons
who
have
never
been
charged
with
a
crime.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
to
the
burglary?
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
none
whatever,
your
honor.
the
burglary
now
is
the
offense
for
which
he
had
received
probation,
and
the
reason--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
that's
right.
and
there
is...
i'm
sorry,
there
is
a
reference
at
the
very
end
of
the
arrest
warrant
to
burglary,
that
being
the
original
offense
for
which
he
had
been
put
on
probation.
there
is
no
reference
in
it
to
driving
while
intoxicated,
which
is
why
he
had
been--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--his
original
offense,
for
which--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes.
original
conviction
for
which
he'd
received
six
years'
probation.
that's
right.
in
addition
to
the
arrest
warrant,
of
course,
at
the
revocation
hearing
itself,
he
received
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
present
everything
that
he
had.
his
counsel,
in
fact,
made
a
two
pronged
attack.
he
did
an
excellent
job,
i'm
sure
every
member
of
the
court
would
agree,
in
the
presentation
of
the
state's
case
to
attempt
to
establish
that
there
was
not
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
believe
that
mr.
vincent
was
actually
intoxicated.
he
did
the
best
job
that
he
could.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
was,
yes,
the
day
after.
now,
i
don't
believe
it
was
filed
until
two
days
later
and
it
wasn't
acted
upon
until
two
days
later.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
not
alone,
your
honor.
not
alone;
no.
it's
not
the
equivalent.
but
in
conjunction
with
the
other
things
that
occurred
in
the
case
and
in
conjunction
with
the
revocation
hearing,
the
final
hearing
itself,
we
do
argue
that
that
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
now,
if
i...
when
gagnon
and
morrissey
v.
brewer
came
down
and
the
texas
courts
started
to
read
those
cases,
i
need
to
explain
the
reaction
that
they
had
in
their
published
opinions
to
those
cases,
because
the
statement
has
been
made,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
consciously
and
steadfastly
ignored
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
eight
years
in
this
area.
and
i
don't
believe
it's
true,
and
i
don't
believe
that
it's
fair.
when
the
cases
came
down
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
read
them
and
said,
well,
this
is
all
very
nice
for
these
other
people,
for
these
people
in
iowa
and
wisconsin
where
these
cases
are
coming
from.
look
what's
happening
to
them;
they're
being
arrested
without
probable
cause,
they're
being
arrested
without
warrant,
they're
being
arrested
by
their
parole
and
probation
officers.
they're
not
only
not
getting
a
preliminary
hearing,
they're
not
even
getting
a
final
hearing.
in
neither
one
of
those
cases
did
those
men
get
a
final
hearing.
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
an
attorney.
the
parolee
after
he
was
arrested
was
carted
away
to
prison
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing,
which
was
100
miles
away,
and
never
got
one
at
all.
those
procedures
are
so
foreign
to
texas
and
so
distant
from
our
procedure
that
our
court
simply
shook
its
head
and
said,
well,
we're
glad
that
we
haven't
done
that;
and
insofar
as
the
supreme
court's
case
by
case
determination
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
final
hearings,
well,
of
course,
we
always
give
the
right
to
counsel
at
all
final
probation
hearings...
revocation
hearings.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
sir,
at
revocation.
it's
a
per
se
right
to
counsel
in
all
cases.
when
the
accused
is
indigent,
counsel
is
appointed
for
him.
there
is
no
exception
to
it
and
it's
always
been
that
way.
now,
when
gagnon
v.
scarpelli
came
down,
the
cases
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
in
its
wake,
said,
well,
the
supreme
court
now
has
also
given
some
rights
in
a
preliminary
hearing.
they
have
to
do
those
things
because
the
way
that
other
states
revoke
probation
is
so
far
different
from
ours,
they
give
such
fewer
rights
at
the
revocation
hearing
itself.
the
accused
has
so
much
less
protection
that
it's
a
necessity.
but
in
texas
that
hearing
is
full
and
fair,
always
he's
represented
by
counsel;
he
has
a
right
to
a
speedy
hearing
in
two
senses:
they
both
apply
the
barker
v.
wingo,
and
the
other
teachings
of
this
court
on
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
which
is
something
very
few
other
states
have
done;
they've
also
passed
a
statute
since
1975
which
creates
a
statutory
right
to
a
speedy
hearing
within
20
days.
there
are
always
written
findings;
there's
never
anyone
but
a
judge
who
conducts
the
hearing.
there
are
no
administrative
revocations
in
texas,
always
a
judge;
unlimited
right
of
appeal;
complete
applicability
of
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
protections,
search
and
seizure.
the
rights
of
the
probationer
are
precisely
the
same
as
any
other
person.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
ruled
invalid
conditions
in
probate--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--that
is
the
large
part
of
what
i'm
saying.
really,
i'm
saying,
though,
that
the
court
must
look
at
the
entire
panoply
of
rights
given
the
accused.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
exactly;
that's
exactly
right.
yes,
your
honor.
that
there
is...
when
you
tailor
a
procedure
for
those
states
which
have
given
no
hearings
at
all,
no
attorneys
at
all,
and
really
no
hearing
of
any
evidence
at
all,
and
say,
well,
these
are
the
minimal
things,
there's
not
an
algebraic
match
up
between
those
things
and
every
other
state.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
your
honor,
if
the
flexibility
in
according
due
process
protections
that
this
court
has
so
frequently
spoken
of
means
anything,
it
means
to
me
that
what
texas
has
done
in
this
case
overall
greatly
exceeds
the
constitutional
minimum,
and
that
the
mere
happenstance
that
as
far
as
the
preliminary
hearing
is
concerned,
that
that
is
not
something
that's
routinely
afforded
in
light
of
all
the
other
procedures,
states
no
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
consistently
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
and
that
the
actual,
the
development
of
these
rights
in
texas,
as
we
tried
to
carefully
explain
in
our
brief,
has
always
either
been
contemporaneous
or
preceded
that
of
this
court.
the
right
to
counsel,
for
example,
is
given
in
texas
in
these
proceedings,
well,
it's
given
today,
and
this
court
has
still
not
given
per
se
right
to
counsel
in
these
proceedings.
so
texas
has
always
believed
that
probation
is
an
essential
component
of
the
whole
criminal
justice
system,
has
always
utilized
it.
i
think
the
statistics
which
we
present
in
our
brief
show
the
overwhelming
use
of
probation.
the
majority
of
felony
convictions
in
texas
end
in
probation.
it's
widespread;
it's
rehabilitative
too.
i
think
it
would
be
a
real
disaster
if
by
tampering
with
the
texas
scheme
unnecessarily
the
result
were
to
be
to
discourage
the
use
of
probation
by
prosecutors
in
texas.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
your
honor,
there
are
all
sorts
of
rights
given
to
all
sorts
of
people,
that
those
people
aren't
told
about.
it's
perhaps
unfortunate.
it
was
clearly
the
intent
of
the
legislature
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
stated
this
on
three
occasions,
that
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
augment
the
general
right
to
a
speedy
hearing
which
had
already
held
in
these
matters,
by
an
even
stricter
statutory
right.
about
the
same
time
they
passed
a
speedy
trial
act
in
general
applicable
to
everyone
else
who
was
not
on
probation,
of
course,
and
in
that
act
they
stated
that
certain
consequences
would
flow
from
violation
of
it.
of
course,
they
didn't
do
the
same
thing
in
the
statute,
and
in
response
to
your
suggestion
that
it's
a
flaw
in
our
argument,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
but
that
our
procedures
are
valid,
even
if
we
didn't
have
the
statute.
and
the
fact
that
we
have
it
merely
illustrates
an
even
additional
attempt
to
assure
that
probationers
are
not
allowed
to
remain
in
jail
indefinitely
before
they
have
their
hearing.
now,
as
a
theoretical
matter,
any
person
might
remain
in
jail
indefinitely
by
a
mistake
being
made.
any
person
could
always
be
thrown
in
jail
and
might
be
overlooked
administratively.
that
danger
always
exists.
and
ultimately,
for
such
a
person,
in
any
context,
all
he
can
do
is
either
get
on
the
telephone
and
call
a
lawyer,
or
file
some
sort
of
paper
with
some
court
protesting;
in
other
words,
amounting
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
well,
the
danger's
no
greater
here.
if
danny
vincent
had
filed
any
sort
of
paper
protesting
his
incarceration
or
asking
to
see
the
judge
or
anything
at
all,
that
might
have
been
construed
as
a
request
for
a
speedy
trial.
i
have
little
doubt
that
it
would
have.
so
that
he
had
some
protection
from
that.
in
addition--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
true
any
more
than
anybody
else
who
was
thrown
in
jail.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
now,
the
record
in
this
case
reflects,
your
honor,
that
he
made
two
phone
calls
to
his
former
attorney.
now,
remember,
this
man
has...
by
definition
has
experience
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
he's
already
been
arrested
for
burglary.
in
our
case
he'd
already
been
arrested
already
for--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
he
already
had
a
lawyer.
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor;
that's
right.
but
he
already
had,
although
this
court
has
often
said
it
on
a
waiver
question,
that
the
experience
in
criminal
law
might
be
waived.
but
he
had
a
former
attorney
in
the
burglary.
he
called
that
lawyer.
he
talked
to
her
on
one
occasion.
he
talked
to
his
probation
officer.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
because
he
testified
to
that
in
the
transcript.
it's
cited,
the
page
cite
is
number--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
sir,
he
had
a
conversation
with
her
on
the
telephone.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
as
i
said,
your
honor--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--in
other
words,
if
he
didn't
get
word
out,
he
could
sit
there
indefinitely?
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
he
could
sit
there
indefinitely
except
that
he
has
a
right
to
bail,
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
and
he
has
a
general--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
he
may.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
it's
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
they
did
it...
directive
reflects...
they
did
it
the
first
time
he'd
been
thrown
in
jail
for
possessing
marijuana.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
on
that
occasion?
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
apparently,
the
judge
might,
the
judge
and
the
district
attorney.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
who's
monitoring
it.
someone
is
monitoring
it,
and
when
he's
taken
into
jail
in
that
fashion,
he's
no
worse
off
than
anybody
else
who's
taken
to
jail.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
the
only
way
that
he's
guaranteed
to
get
it,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
same
as
if
i
were
walking
down
the
street
and
were
thrown
in
jail,
the
only
way
i
could
guarantee
to
get
my
due
process
is
to
ask
for
it.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
if
i
were
a
legislator
i
might
have
written
that
statute
a
little
differently,
but
i
am
adamant
upon
the
point
that
if
we
didn't
have
the
statute
our
procedures
would
still
be
constitutional.
i
would
have
a
hard
time
understanding
how,
under
the
procedures
this
court
approved
in
gagnon
and
morrissey
v.
brewer...
it
should
be
recalled,
if
this
man
were
from
wisconsin
or
iowa,
under
those
procedures,
his
probation
officer
could
have
seen
him
driving
down
the
street
and
thought
he
was
intoxicated,
could
have
stopped
him
on
his
own,
could
have
said,
i
think
you're
drunk,
come
with
me,
taken
him
in
to
his
office,
called
in
his
coworker,
his
co
probation
officer
from
next
door...
apparently,
as
i
read
the
law,
that
would
be
a
hearing
by
a
neutral
person...
and
say,
this
man
is
drunk,
i'm
going
to
throw
him
in
jail.
is
that
all
right
with
you?
and
his
coworker
might
say,
well,
have
you
got
anything
to
say
for
yourself?
he
might
say,
well,
i
haven't
had
that
much
to
drink.
my
girl
friend's
here,
do
you
want
to
talk
to
her?
he
could
talk
to
her,
satisfy
himself
that
there
was
probable
cause,
take
him
in,
throw
him
in
jail.
now--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--i
say
that
it
would,
as
i
read
the
case.
now,
if
that's
going
to
comply
with
what
this
court
says
is
the
minimum,
i
can't
understand
how
what
texas
did
in
this
case
can
be
said
to
fall
below
that
standard.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
be
incomprehensible
to
me.
gerstein
v.
pugh
appears
to
wholly
bar
relief
even
if
the
court
were
to
find
a
defect
with
the
preliminary
hearing
in
texas.
he's
already
received
that
in
the
revocation
hearing
and
the
retroactivity
discussion
in
our
brief,
of
course,
is
really
meant
to
buttress
that
type
of
fact.
if
it
is
going
to
be
applied
to
anyone,
particularly
if
it's
going
to
be
applied
retroactively,
as
we
state
in
our
brief,
there
are
several
thousand
probationers
in
texas
who
were
sent
to
prison
under
these
procedures.
there
are
also
in
other
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
texas
is
not
alone
in
what
it's
done
and
the
way
it's
responded
to
morrissey
v.
brewer
and
gagnon.
there
have
been
several
states,
and
i
would
include
among
these
michigan,
florida,
georgia,
and
kentucky,
in
my
belief,
according
to
how
i
read
their
case
law,
have
responded
by
saying,
we
don't
think,
in
our
state,
that
the
supreme
court's
gone
far
enough
in
what
they
should
give
at
the
actual
revocation
hearing,
whether
it's
parole
or
probation.
we
think
that
we
should
go
farther
than
that.
and
at
the
same
time
they
have
loosened
up
or
introduced
the
element
of
flexibility
into
what
they
were
going
to
require
in
terms
of
the
preliminary
hearing
or
whether
they
would
require
one
at
all.
the
court
has
consistently
spoken
of
the
need
to
recognize
and
hold
the
flexible
procedures
introduced
by
the
states
where
possible.
we
feel
this
is
clear
in
such
a
situation.
indeed,
the
two
things
that
were
cited
as
need
for
a
preliminary
hearing
in
gagnon
and
morrissey
were
first
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
time
lag
between
time
of
arrest
and
the
final
hearing,
and
that
there
would
be
a
geographical
disparity;
he
may
be
carted
away
to
prison.
i've
already
addressed
the
question
of
time
lag.
we
say
there
wasn't
one
in
this
case,
and
there
couldn't
be,
reasonably,
under
the
texas
procedures.
as
far
as
the
geographic
matter,
in
texas,
there
is
a
right
under
our
statutes
to
have
your
final
revocation
hearing
at
the
place
of
your
arrest,
where
you
were
arrested
for
your
violation
of
your
probation,
or
where
you
reside.
there
are
venue
provisions.
any
judge
can
transfer
jurisdiction
wherever
necessary
or
helpful
to
present
evidence
and
witnesses.
he
has,
not
the
limited
right
of
confrontation
and
cross
examination
that
this
court
has
spoken
of
in
those
cases,
but
an
unconditional
right.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
invariably.
invariably
a
judge.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
always
a
judge,
always
an
attorney.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
no,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall
may
well
have
pointed
out
something
that
we
might
have
done
better,
but
in
truth,
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
that's
in
our
brief,
which
was
prepared
painstakingly,
where
there
is
a
comparison
of
texas
procedures
with
those
of
every
other
state,
as
to
what
we
selected
as
broad
based
matters
of
comparison,
fourth
amendment
protection,
fifth
amendment
rights,
right
to
counsel,
and
whether
or
not
each
of
those
states
affords
those
protections,
texas
is
the
only
state
with
"yes's"
all
the
way
across
except
of
course
that
a
preliminary
hearing
is
not
invariably
required.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
the
probation
officer
has
to
file
the
motion.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
at
court.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
an
arrest
warrant
has
to
be
issued.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
the
judge.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
right.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
what's
attached
to
the
motion
to
revoke?
there's
no
evidence
that
is
attached.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
there
is
always
commonly
an
affidavit,
yes,
sir.
it's
signed
by
the
probation
officer
and
attorney--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--right.
but...
not
by
an
attorney;
no.
just
by
the
probation
officer,
and
the
district
attorney--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--it's...
yes,
it's
made
up
for,
that
it's
almost
made
up
for,
and
that
it's
close
enough
to
be
an
all
right
made
up
for,
but
because
of
the
lack
of
a
wrongful
determination
down
the
line,
because
of
that
hearing
that's
coming
soon,
that
dealing
both
ends
of
the
spectrum--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
except
that
the
accused
has
no
right
to
be
there.
he's
not
present;
he
doesn't
hear
anything--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--well,
that's
how
i
read
it;
yes,
sir.
if
i'm
wrong
upon
that
point,
that's
fine.
but--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--yes,
but
as
i
read
it,
yes,
he's
required
to
be
there.
he's
not
always
allowed
to
present
evidence.
he's
not
always
allowed
to
present
witnesses.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes,
that's
right.
i
don't...
i
think
surely
if
texas
also
required
the
presence
of
the
accused
at
a
preliminary
hearing
and
put
all
that
on
top
of
all
this,
we
might
all
applaud
that.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
yes.
it's
as
reliable
as
any--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--this
is
true,
your
honor.
but,
of
course,
in
this
case
the
arresting
officer
and
the
probation
officer
both
spoke
to
him
and
of
course
he
raised
no--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--right.
if
anything
like
that
had
been
raised,
well,
these
officers
would
have
had
the
duty
to
tell
the
magistrate
about
that
when
they
told
him
about
probable
cause.
or
at
least
to
tell...
if
they
didn't
tell
him
about
that,
they
were
aware
of
that
and
would
still
have
been
of
the
opinion,
your
honor,
there's
probable
cause
to
arrest
this
man.
in
my
opinion
he
was
drunk.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
none
whatsoever.
under
the
texas
procedures,
at
the
revocation
of
probation,
also,
frequently
the
only
issue...
and
the
only
issue
in
this
case,
after
the
guilt
or
innocence
part
of
the
hearing...
was
whether
or
not
to
continue
his
probation.
in
texas
the
probationer
has
a
right
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
be
continued
on
probation
even
if
he's
found
to
be
in
violation
of
it.
in
fact,
this
was
already
done
once
in
mr.
vincent's
case.
and
that
is
the
real
work
of
a
lawyer
in
the
texas
procedures
and
one
of
the
main
reasons
that
he
gets
a
lawyer.
not
only
can
he
be
continued
on
probation,
but
his
term
of
imprisonment
can
be
reduced
by
the
judge
at
that
point
to
any
term
that
he
feels
is
just.
again,
he
had
assistance
of
counsel
there,
and
his
counsel
here
today
drove
very
hard
upon
both
of
those
points
at
that
hearing.
the
final
matter
i
wanted
to
mention,
i
suppose
that
indeed
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
i
was
informed
by
mr.
rodak,
had
been
denied
rather
than
carried
with
the
case.
so
there
will
be
no
further,
nothing
further
presented.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
well,
of
course,
we
have
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
he's
a
fugitive.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
he
is
incarcerated
in
colorado.
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
in
another
state
there
is--
mr.
douglas
m.
becker
--for
a
different...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
for
revocation
of
probation
up
there,
if
you
can
believe
it.
he
got
up
there
and
apparently
committed
an
offense,
was
on
probation,
got
revoked,
he's
in
the
colorado
penitentiary.
there's
a
detainer
on
him
from
the
state
of
texas
to
be
returned
to
do
his
time
after
he's
through
there.
thank
you.
