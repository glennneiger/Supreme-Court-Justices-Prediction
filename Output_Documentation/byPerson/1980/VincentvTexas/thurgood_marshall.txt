justice
marshall
is
it
also
true
that
he
wouldn't
get
it
if
he
didn't
do
it?
justice
marshall
well,
we
realize
that
a
man
in
huntsville
doesn't
move
around
freely,
don't
we?
justice
marshall
do
you
know
that
our
constitution
has
two
sets
of
rules,
one
for
those
who
know,
and
one
for
those
who
do
not
know?
justice
marshall
how'd
you
know
that?
justice
marshall
i
think
i
remember
that
one.
justice
marshall
but
my
whole
point
is
that
you
put
a
guy
in
jail
and
then
the
statute
says,
if
you
can
get
word
out,
you'll
get
a
hearing.
well,
in
my
book
that's
not
due
process.
justice
marshall
is
that
the
texas
system?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
does
he
get
the
bail
without
applying
for
it?
justice
marshall
how?
justice
marshall
well,
how
can
the
court
give
him
bail
if
he
doesn't
ask
for
it?
justice
marshall
well,
how
did
he
get
before
the
court?
justice
marshall
i
thought
this
case
was
talking
about
the
man
who
is
in
jail?
justice
marshall
well,
how
can
he
get
bail
in
jail
if
he
doesn't
apply
for
it?
does
the
judge
go
around
and
say,
do
you
want
bail?
justice
marshall
i'm
just
asking
for
facts.
justice
marshall
is
the
only
way
that
he
gets
this
due
process
is
to
ask
for
it
in
some
fashion?
justice
marshall
does
that
make
it
right?
