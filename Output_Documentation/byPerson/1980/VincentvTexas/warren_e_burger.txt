chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
vincent
v.
texas.
mr.
mccutcheon,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
now,
you're
going
to
tell
us
why
that
wasn't
swallowed
up
by
the
subsequent
developments,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
burger
why
that
lack,
assuming
that
there
was
a
lack,
was
not
swallowed
up
and
made
irrelevant
by
the
subsequent
events?
chief
justice
burger
what
else
do
you
want?
chief
justice
burger
right.
chief
justice
burger
well,
do
you
have
any
complaint
about
the
revocation
hearing
on
the
proceeding?
chief
justice
burger
you
have
no
complaint
about
it
now?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then,
what
good--
chief
justice
burger
--would
the
preliminary
hearing
do
you
under
the
morrissey
case?
chief
justice
burger
well,
would
not
the
practical
effect...
tell
me
what
the
practical
effect
would
be?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
gerstein
v.
pugh
tell
us
about
that
problem?
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
we
wouldn't
void
a
conviction
on
that
ground,
do
you
think
we
ought
to
void
a
parole
revocation
on
that
ground?
chief
justice
burger
and
then
what
would
happen?
they'd
have
another
parole
revocation
hearing
all
over
again?
chief
justice
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
that's
dead
and
gone?
chief
justice
burger
a
revocation
couldn't
properly
be
based
upon
that
conduct?
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
chief
justice
burger
--do
you
think
it's
the
function
of
this
court
to
be
handing
out
peppercorns
or
granting
significant
relief?
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
need
the
hearing
for
at
that
stage,
in
view
of
his
subsequent
admission
at
the
revocation
hearing
that
he
had
violated
the
conditions
of
his
parole?
why
aren't
all
the
preceding
steps
utterly
moot
and
irrelevant?
chief
justice
burger
but
he's
determined
it.
he's
determined
it
by
his
admission.
chief
justice
burger
what
did
he
admit
when
he
had
the
revocation
hearing,
which
was
a
number
of
days
or
weeks
later?
chief
justice
burger
and
he
was
conscious
of
having
admitted
it
before?
chief
justice
burger
well,
that
isn't
what
morrissey
v.
brewer
held
at
all.
morrissey
v.
brewer
said
that
the
first
hearing
should
be
held
promptly
to
determine,
among
other
things,
whether
they
got
the
wrong
person...
they
might
have
two
people
of
the
same
name...
to
give
them
a
chance
to
have
witnesses
that
are
in
the
same
neighborhood
if
the
place
of
the
ultimate
revocation
hearing
is
far
distant.
now,
here,
where
he
has
admitted
in
the
second
hearing
that
he
was
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
liquor,
that
he
admitted
it
on
the
scene
at
the
time,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
preliminary
hearing
was
lost
and
gone,
by
his
own
admissions.
and
why,
why
are
we
wasting
the
time
of
the
courts
to
decide
this
academic
question
which
you
concede
probably
has
no
practical
consequence?
chief
justice
burger
it
isn't
a
class
action,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested--
chief
justice
burger
--where
you
make
the
establishing
procedure.
chief
justice
burger
we've
established
that
in
morrissey
v.
brewer.
chief
justice
burger
well,
you're
here
to
see,
to
have
us
monitor
the
state
courts
on
their
actual
application?
chief
justice
burger
and,
will
you
tell
us
again
what
you
can
accomplish?
chief
justice
burger
yes,
but,
again,
morrissey
v.
brewer
said
he's
entitled
to
be
sure
you've
got
the
right
man
so
they
don't
send
him
back
to
jail
because
of
an
act
committed
by
someone
else
of
the
same
name.
and
so
that
he
is
entitled
to
have
the
witnesses
in
his
own
locality
brought
into
that
preliminary
hearing,
and
it
is
not
even
a
judicial
hearing.
it
could
be
a
probation
officer.
chief
justice
burger
and
the
probation
officer
dealt
with
it
here.
chief
justice
burger
and
he
rather
sensibly
concluded
that
nothing
else
was
necessary,
in
view
of
the
admissions
of
this
man
that
he
was
driving
under
those
conditions,
would
you
not
agree
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
becker,
among
other
things,
perhaps
you
will
enlighten
me
on
why
we're
here
at
all.
chief
justice
burger
does
the
language,
"the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
an
arrest
warrant
should
issue--
"
chief
justice
burger
--does
that
equate
to
probable
cause?
is
that
an
implicit
finding?
chief
justice
burger
this
hearing
that
you
referred
to,
the
order
on
page
18,
that
occurred
two
days,
no
one
day
after
the
drunken
driving
episode,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
suggest
that
that
process
is
the
equivalent,
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
hearing
that
might
have
been
held
before
a
neutral
probation
officer
under
morrissey
v.
brewer?
chief
justice
burger
at
revocation?
chief
justice
burger
in
other
words,
you're
saying
texas
is
giving
a
great
deal
more
than
morrissey
v.
brewer
required.
chief
justice
burger
and
that
would
comply
with
morrissey
v.
brewer,
you
say?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
always
a
judge
of
the
state
of
texas
who
hears
the
revocation
proceeding?
chief
justice
burger
and
that's
considerably
beyond
our
cases,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
well,
under
morrissey
v.
brewer,
a
man
in
this
situation,
apparently
driving
while
intoxicated,
might
come
into
that
preliminary
hearing
and
bring
in
the
affidavit
of
his
dentist
that
he'd
just
had
two
teeth
pulled
and
that
he
had
given
him
a
sedative
and
that
that
would
explain
a
condition
that
would
resemble
intoxication.
and
then
the
probation
officer
might
say,
well,
with
that
explanation,
after
this
don't
drive
your
car
after
you've
had
a
sedative,
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
or,
if
he
came
in
and
said,
i
am
not
the
man
who
got
arrested
for
driving
while
drunk,
that
was
another
man
of
the
same
name,
and
the
probation
officer
if
satisfied
would
then
drop
the
matter.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
burger
so
there
were
no
problems
of
the
kind
that
we
were
concerned
about
in
morrissey
v.
brewer?
chief
justice
burger
now,
your
friend
has
not
suggested...
at
least
if
he
did,
i
didn't
hear
him
suggest
anything
that
might
have
been
done,
any
showing
that
he
might
have
made
at
that
morrissey
v.
brewer
hearing.
can
you
think
of
anything
that
might
have
been
accomplished
by
holding
that
hearing
right
on
the
ground
at
the
time?
chief
justice
burger
is
he
still
a
fugitive,
if
you
know?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
he
incarcerated
or
not?
chief
justice
burger
--for
another
offense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
mccutcheon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
vincent
against
texas
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning.
we
hold
that
the
appeal
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
must
be
dismissed
for
want
of
a
properly
presented
federal
question
and
it
is
so
ordered.
