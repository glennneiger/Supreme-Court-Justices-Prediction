harry

miss
harris,
i
want
to
be
sure
about
one
thing.
the
charge
was
filed
after
180
days
but
still
while
he
was
in
the
employment
of
the
college.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
under
your
theory,
then,
the
charge
was
filed
even
before
the
statute
of
limitations
period
began?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
he
was
aware
of
the
alleged
discrimination,
all
right.
isn't
that
a
little
bit
unusual,
though,
for
the
person
to
be
able
to
file
the
charge
even
before
a
limitations
period
begins?
