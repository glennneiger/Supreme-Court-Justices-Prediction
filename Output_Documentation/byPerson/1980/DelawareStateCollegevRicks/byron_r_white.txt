what
about
plain
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
would
have
been,
in
his
mind,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
even
if
tenure
was
legally
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
not
two
separate
violations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
say
there
were
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
were
his
appeal
rights
exhausted
on
the
tenure
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
september?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
tenure
decision
doesn't
automatically
result
in
termination,
didn't
the
one
year
contract
even
more
clearly
indicate
that
he
was
terminated
at
the
end
of
that
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
the
one
year
contract
that
was
then
given
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
was
discretionary
but
would
it
be...
if
that
was
the
discriminatory
act,
would
it
be
untimely,
would
the
filing
be
untimely?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
issuance
of
the
one
year
contract.
justice
white
but
what
if
that
were
determined
to
be
the
discriminatory
act?
would
that
have
been
timely
or
not?
justice
white
he
chose
to
accept
it
but
it
was
also,
it
certainly
was
unequivocally
indicated
then
that
he
was
terminated
at
the
end
of
that
year?
justice
white
even
if
he
didn't
know
when
tenure
was
terminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
this
is,
or
most
of
it
is
irrelevant,
if
you
are
correct
on
this
300-day
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
as
well
as
an
amicus
support
that
and
so
as
a
respondent
you
are
urging
this
in
support
of
the
decision
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
white
what
is
the
evidence
in
this
case,
or
what
supports
the
suggestion
or
the
assertion
that
the
final
contract
that
he
was
given
was
a
terminal
one
year
contract?
justice
white
is
that
what
the
contract
said?
justice
white
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
it
was
a
terminal
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
mean
that
he
would
not
be
working
for
the
university
after
the
end
of
that
terminal
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
otherwise
it
isn't
terminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
terminal
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it
suggest
that
although
in
other
circumstances
you
might
have
had
another
one
year
contract
issued
to
you
after
this
one,
you
won't
be
issued
another
one
after
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
they...
the
only
condition
on
the
letter
was
if
the
board
of
trustees
granted
him
tenure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
court
of
appeals
said
the
discriminatory
act
was
a
continuing
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
but
it
was
a
process.
and
when
did
it
begin?
when
did
the
process
begin?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
charge
was
filed
after
that?
