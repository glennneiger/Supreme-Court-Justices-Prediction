mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
employment
discrimination
case.
it
was
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
in
delaware
by
mr.
ricks
alleging
unlawful
discrimination
based
on
his
national
origin.
there
really
is
a
narrow
question
before
the
court,
when
does
the
statute
of
limitations
period
run
on
the
two
statutes
in
issue?
and
those
two
statutes
are
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
42
united
states
code
1981.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes.
mr.
justice
brennan
(sic),
it
went
through
the
district
court
and
the
3rd
circuit
on
the
180-day--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--yes.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
their
contention
is
that
there
was
a
state
filing
on
april
11
of
1975
by
mr.
ricks
with
the
state
agency,
the
state
department
of
labor.
and
that
triggered
the
300-day
extension
for
eeoc
filing.
now,
there
are
myriad
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
concerning
this
of
which
i
am
sure
you
are
aware.
they
go
from
one
extreme
of
saying
that
if
you
file
anywhere
you're
entitled
300
days;
that's
one
part
of
it.
the
other
end
is
that
you
must
have
a
state
filing
which
is
timely,
which
this
was
not.
delaware
was
120
days.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
it
was
not
a
timely
state
filing.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
is,
i
think
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
3rd
circuit.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
i
think
that
is
the
ruling
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
that
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
3rd
circuit.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
that
could
be
very
true
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
glad
it
was
brought
up
here,
mr.
justice
white,
because
if
it
was
plain
error,
then,
very
obviously,
you
must
rule
on
it.
but
as
i
said,
there
seems
to
be
no
decision
in
the
lower
courts
concerning
this,
and
in
our
particular
case
i
really
don't
think
it
makes
that
much
of
a
difference.
and
i'd
be
glad
to
cover
that
later
but--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--mr.
justice
stewart,
the
district
court
decided
that
the
date
that
triggered
the
statute
of
limitations
was
june
26,
1974,
the
date
of
the
terminal
letter
to
mr.
ricks.
now
that,
if
you
take
back
300
days
from
april
28,
1975,
the
date
of
the
filing,
that
would
be
back
to
july
2
of
1974.
so
the
district
court
action
of
june
26,
1974,
when
they
said,
that's
when
the
statute,
the
last
discriminatory
act,
that
would
be
on
that
date.
also
the
date
of
denial
of
tenure
of
march
13,
1974,
that
would
also
be
beyond
that
date.
so
that's
the
reason
i
say
to
the
court
that
in
those
circumstances
i
really
don't
think
it
makes
that
much
difference.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes.
that
was
filed
on
september
9,
1977.
so
three
years
back
under
the--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--yes.
it's
three
years
under
delaware,
delaware
laws.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
the
district
court
chose
the
june
26,
1974
date,
and
that
was
the
date
that
mr.
ricks
was
notified
that
he
would
receive
a
terminal
contract,
and
dismissed
both
actions
under
title
vii
and
also
1981
as
being
time-barred.
the
3rd
circuit
took
the
date
of
the
end
of
the
terminal
contract,
which
was
june
30,
1975.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
is
not.
the
3rd
circuit
picked
this
date
and
they
laid
down
a
law
that
is
applicable
in
that
circuit
to
title
vii
cases,
to
1981
cases,
which
we
feel
is
highly
undesirable
and
is
not
only
contrary
to
law,
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
and
their
decision
was
that
when
the
employee
knows
or
a
reasonable
person
should
know
in
his
circumstances
that
his
employer
is
going
to
terminate
him
and...
and
it's
very
important
because
it's
a
two-part
decision...
and
he
leaves
the
service
of
his
employer,
then
the
statute
starts
to
run.
and
that's
the
law
in
the
3rd
circuit,
and
that's
the
reason
for
our
appeal.
now,
we
feel
it's
contrary
to
the
plain
reading,
the
plain
language
of
title
vii.
title
vii
sets
out
unlawful
employment
acts
and
it
sets
those
out
as
being
compensation,
terms
of
employment,
conditions
and
privileges,
and
it
places
a
time
limitation
and
it
says
you
must
file
within
180
days
from
the
alleged
unlawful
act.
what
the
3rd
circuit
is
doing
is
substituting
for
that
and
it's
saying,
you
can
wait
until
you're
terminated
or
until
you
have
a
final
decision
to
file.
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
believe
that's
a
holding.
i
believe
it
can
be
read
that
way.
i
hope
it
will
be
read
that
way.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
dr.
ricks
alleged
two,
really
two
basic
reasons:
denial
of
tenure
and
termination.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
those
two
or--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--let
me
discuss
the
facts
of
our
particular
case.
under
the
tenure
policy
in
effect
at
the
time
that
dr.
ricks
was
there
a
denial
of
tenure
for
the
second
time,
which
is
exactly
what
took
place,
automatically
results
in
a
terminal
contract.
so
it
automatically
results
in
his
termination.
now,
he
has
a
right
to
accept
a
one-year
terminal
contract.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
which
he
did.
and
at
the
end
of
that
period
of
time--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--he
was
out
of
work,
and...
but
he
did
not
have
to
accept
that,
that
was
up
to
him.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
but
what
my
argument
is,
that
the
termination
of
his
services
is
not
the
alleged
unlawful
act,
the
denial
of
tenure
is.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes;
very...
sure.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
but
the
decision
here,
among
other
things,
flies
straight
in
the
face
of
the
decision
in
the
evans
case,
because
in
that
case
you
had
a
stewardess
who
was
denied...
their
policy
at
that
time
was,
an
airline
stewardess
could
not
be
married.
if
she
married
she
had
to
resign.
that
was
in
1968.
that
was
the
unlawful
act.
it
was
later
to
be
held
by
this
court
to
be
unlawful.
she
came
back
to
work
in
1972
and
she
said,
i'm
now
being
denied
seniority
because
i
was
terminated
in
1968
unlawfully.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
past
act,
beyond
the
statutory
period,
the
1968
termination
or
resignation
has
no
present
effect,
and
you
must
show
a
present
violation.
now,
our
argument
here
is
exactly
the
same,
that
dr.
ricks
was
denied
tenure
march
13,
1974.
that
is
barred
by
all
statutes
of
limitations,
1981,
title
vii.
he--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--yes,
he
does,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--well,
evans...
evans,
she
left...
very
true--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--the
point
i
would
like
to
make,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
as
far
as
continuing
is
concerned,
dr.
ricks
does
not
say
that
our
tenure
policy,
to
which
he
was
subjected,
is
unconstitutional
or
discriminatory
toward
him.
and
the
same
thing
in
the
evans
case.
the
stewardess
did
not
contend
that
the
seniority
policy
was
discriminatory
toward
her.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
you...
the
court
held
in
the
majority
in
that
case
that
he
had
to
have
a
present
violation,
and
there
was
no
present
violation.
and
our
contention
here
is
that
there
is
no
present
violation.
there's
a
termination:
a
denial
of
tenure
automatically
results
in
a
terminal
contract.
so
the
day
that
he
last
worked
has
no
significance
under
title
vii.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
under
the
faculty
policy
which
he
was
subject
to,
when
he
was
denied
tenure
on
march
13,
1974,
by
the
board
of
trustees,
that
was
a
final
act.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes,
he
was
denied
tenure--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--very
true,
justice
stewart.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
our
argument
there--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--i
don't
think
so
under
the
3rd
circuit
opinion
because
it's
an
overall
opinion.
as
i
read
their
opinion
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
have
to
have,
number
one,
that
he
knows
his
employer's
going
to
finally
terminate
him.
that's
the
first
test.
and,
number
two...
and
one
could
come
before
two
or
two
could
come
after
one...
he
has
to
leave
his
employment.
and
i
think
that's
the
rule
that
is
laid
down
in
this
case.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
that's
our
very
point.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
well,
i
think
the
3rd
circuit
has
put
out
a
general
rule
and
that's
our
argument
and
i
think
that's
wrong.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
and
i
think
eeoc
does
say
that.
it
says
that
he
could
have
sued
in
1973,
or
march
21
when
he
was
denied
tenure
for
the
first
time;
and
he
could
have
sued
when
he
was
denied
tenure
for
the
second
time.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no,
that's
very
true,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
he
took--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--i
don't
think
so
because
his
rights
were
terminated
once
the
board
of
trustees
denied
tenure
to
him.
and
he
knew
that
under
the
faculty
policy,
under
the
aaup
policy.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
well,
i
think
he
could
have
gone
in
at
that
time
and
sued
for
a
damage
claim
because--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--no,
his
contract...
see,
he
was
unemployed
as
of
june
30,
1974,
had
he
not
decided
to
take
the
terminal
contract.
see,
that
had
to
be
offered
to
him
under
the
aaup
regulations.
it
was
his
decision
to
take
that
terminal
contract
or
not,
and--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--yes,
he
knew
that
that
was...
june
30,
1975,
he
was
done
work.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
problem
that
you
brought
up
is
a
problem
we're
concerned
with.
denial
of
promotion
is
an
unlawful
act.
now
that
could,
under
the
opinion
of
the
3rd
circuit,
that
could
occur
five
years...
say
in
1975,
and
under
their
reasoning,
the
employee
could
wait
until
he's
terminated
and
then
he
could
bring
that
as
an
unlawful
act.
and
that's
the
thing
that
disturbs
us.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
that's
the
reading.
they
quoted
from
bonham,
another
3rd
circuit
opinion,
and
they
quoted
that
very
explicitly,
and
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--no,
i
certainly
agree,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
holding
of
the
3rd
circuit.
i
read,
or
i'd
be
happy
to
read
their
holding
again,
and
they
quoted
from
bonham,
which
was
an
age
and
discrimination
act.
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
time
limitation
should
be
construed
similarly.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
well,
that
would
not
activate
the
ricks
decision,
because
there
was
no
employment.
they're
just
saying,
in
employment
termination
cases
where
the
employee
actually
leaves
the
employer.
but
that
is
the
date
when
the
statute
starts
to
run.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes,
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
another
example,
mr.
justice,
i'd
like
to
bring
out
is
the
denial
of
seniority.
that
is
a
discriminatory
denial
of
seniority
while
one
is
employed
is
also
a
discriminatory
act
and
it
could
be
sued
upon
when
that
occurs.
now,
if
that
employee
does
not
sue
under
the
3rd
circuit
rules,
does
not
bring
an
eeoc
action
and
then,
say,
three
or
four
years
later
they
have
a
rifing
policy
because
of
decrease
in
work
force
and
because
he
was
denied
that
promotion
he
doesn't
make
it
and
his
seniority,
those
people
having
his
seniority
are
terminated,
then
according
to
the
3rd
circuit,
he
can
bring
that.
and
it
leads
to
stale
claims
and
everything
that
this
court
has
said
should
not
occur
under
the
statute
of
limitations
and
under
title
vii.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
under
rule
12(b)(6).
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
the
complaint
originally
listed
six
counts.
and
all
counts
were
adjudged
to
be
time-barred.
some...
i
think
two
by
agreement
of
counsel,
and
the
rest
by
the
court.
and
it
covered
the
entire
spectrum
from
denial
of
first
amendment
rights
to
state
rights
under
pendent
jurisdiction,
violation
of
terms
of
contract,
things
of
that
nature.
everything
was
dismissed
except
these
two
actions.
now,
in
oral
argument
before
judge
stapleton,
the
district
judge,
miss
harris
indicated,
i
believe...
and
i
think
she
may
contest
that...
but
judge
stapleton
assumed
that
there
were
two
violations,
denial
of
tenure
and
termination.
and
that
is
what
he
based
his
opinion
on.
and
i
think
the
reason--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
white,
because
he
thought
that
tenure
was
legally
denied;
then
that
automatically
led
to
termination.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no.
i
don't
believe
so.
he
considered
two
separate
violations.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
he
said
that
dr.
ricks
said
there
were
two.
that's
what
he
surmised
from
the
complaint.
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
he
picked
the
june
26,
1974,
date,
because
as
of
that
time
dr.
ricks
had
been
denied
tenure,
which
occurred
by
the
board
of
trustees
on
march
13,
1974,
and
the
significance
of
the
june
26,
1974,
date
is
a
letter
from
the
board
president
indicating
that
he
would
be
offered
a
terminal
contract.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
on
the
tenure
decision?
would
have--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--he
filed
suit
september
9,
1977,
so
it
would
have
been
september
9,
1974.
the
june
date
would
have
been
prior
to
that.
if
you
take
180
days,
it
would
have
been
october
7,
1974.
that's
taking
180
days
under
the
title
vii
case.
if
you
take
300
days,
it
would
have
been
july
2,
1974.
so
the
june
26
date
of
1974
is
valid
either
under
the
300
days
or
the
180
days.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
it
depends,
justice
rehnquist,
on
what
you
call
timely
filing.
it
was
120
days,
a
maximum.
so
that
it
was
not
a
timely
filing
for
the
june
26,
1974,
act
that
judge
stapleton
considered
significant.
there
was
a
final...
dr.
ricks
grieved,
filed
grievance
proceedings
in
may
of
1974,
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
grieved
was
denial
of
tenure.
the
grievance
committee
reached
a
final
decision
on
september
12,
1974.
and
our
argument
there
is
that
this
court
has
held
by
your
opinion
in
electrical
workers
that
a
grievance
procedure
does
not
toll
the
statute
under
title
vii.
and
the
reasoning
there
was
that
the
congress
did
not
provide
for
such
a
tolling
and
there
are
really
two
separate
actions,
the
grievance
procedure
is
contractual,
title
vii
is
an
act
of
congress.
and
that's
our
argument
there
for
saying
that
the
september
12,
1974,
date
is
merely
a
decision
on
the
grievance
procedure.
we
feel
that
the
decision
is
directly
contrary
to
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
that
if
you
permit
someone
to
sue
when
they
know
they're
going
to
be
terminated,
finally
or
when
they
do
leave
employment,
that
that
violates
the
whole
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
it's
very
pertinent
in
this
case
because
the
statute
is
to
prevent
stale
claims,
to
allow
you
to
have
witnesses.
two
of
the
key
witnesses
in
this
case
are
now
unavailable,
if
it
goes
back
and
is
required
to
be
tried.
one
is
deceased
and
one
has
removed
from
the
jurisdiction.
the
whole
intent
of
congress
in
title
vii
is
to
expedite
these
claims.
there
are
time
limitations
throughout.
if
no
agreement
is
reached
by
eeoc
in
the
conciliation
agreement
then
the
employee
may
file
suit
and
the
district
court
is
asked
in
the
statute
to
assign
a
judge
to
the
case
and
to
expedite
the
case
with
all
due
speed.
we
think
it's
also
very
contrary
to
practical
considerations.
it
leaves
the
employer
in
a
state
of
not
knowing
what's
going
to
happen.
he
can
have
a
termination
four
or
five
years
from
the
date
that
it
occurred,
which
could
be
promotion,
denial
of
promotion,
and
then
under
the
3rd
circuit
ruling
suit
could
be
brought
at
that
time.
that
also
leaves
the
employee
in
doubt.
does
he
file
a
title
vii
as
written,
which
says,
180
days
from
the
date
of
the
discriminatory
act,
or
does
he
file
under
the
3rd
circuit
ruling,
that
he
can
bring
suit
after
he
leaves
the
services
of
his
employer?
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
rehnquist.
it
depends
on
when
you
take
the
date
of
the
last
discriminatory
act.
if
you
take
it
as
far
as
we're
concerned
and
we
agree
that
it
should
be
at
the
very
latest,
june
26,
1974,
when
ricks
was
notified
of
his
terminal
contract,
then
that's
the
last
discriminatory
act.
i
think
our
argument
would
even
take
it
back
in
time
to
march
13,
1974,
when
that
decision
to
deny
tenure
became
final.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
our
argument
there
is
that
he
was
terminated
once
tenure
was
denied
because
he--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--yes,
that's
very
true,
but
under
the
policy,
once
he
was
denied
tenure
for
the
second
time,
he
was
automatically
offered
a
terminal
contract.
that
was
the
act,
denial
of
tenure
was
the
act.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
we
disagree
with
that,
very
respectfully.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
yes,
sir.
but
under
the
faculty
regulations,
mr.
justice,
he
knew
that
the
second
time
he
was
denied
tenure,
that
he
would
no
longer
be
employed
by
the
college,
and
our
argument
is
that
that,
if
there
was
an
alleged
discriminatory
act,
it
occurred
then,
because
that
sealed--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--yes.
that
sealed
his
fate,
at
that
point.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
i
think
it
does.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
the
denial
of
tenure,
mr.
justice
white,
does
result
in
termination.
there's
no
question
about
it.
that's
clearly
in
the
policy
that
was
just
as
much
a
part
of
dr.
ricks'
contract
as
if
it
had
been
written
in
there.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
that
was
entirely
discretionary.
the
aaup--
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
--the
denial
of
tenure,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no.
that
was
provided
by
aaup
regulations.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
they
had
to
offer
that.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no.
that
was
a
voluntary
act
by
dr.
ricks.
he
could
accept
the
terminal
contract
for
one
year
or
he
could
reject
it.
he
chose
to
accept
it.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
no
question
about
it.
he
knew
as
of
march
13,
1974,
when
the
board
of
trustees
made
the
decision
to
deny
tenure.
mr.
nicholas
h.
rodriguez
he
grieved
tenure
but
i
say,
under
the
ruling
of
electrical
employees,
the
grievance
procedure
does
not
toll
the
statute
under
title
vii.
that's
very
clearly
the
holding
of
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
