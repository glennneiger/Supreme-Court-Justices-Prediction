ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
answering
a
question
posed
by
justice
stewart
concerning
what
it
is
that
dr.
ricks
is
claiming
in
his
complaint.
he
is
claiming
that,
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
his
complaint
indicates
that
he
is
claiming
that
his
discharge
is
discriminatory
for
reasons
of
national
origin.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
well,
the
complaint
was
framed
with
a
multiplicity
of
issues,
and
sometimes
that
creates
problems
that
one
couldn't
foresee
until
hindsight.
at
any
rate,
he
is
claiming
that
his
discharge
was
discriminatory
and
he's
claiming
it
both
ways.
he's
claiming
that
the
ultimate
discharge
of
him
on
june
30,
1975,
was
discriminatory.
he's
also
claiming
that
his
discharge
was
caused
by
the
tenure
denial
and
that
the
discharge
was
discriminatory
and
that
that
process,
that
discriminatory
process
of
the
denial
of
tenure
caused
a
discriminatory
discharge.
so
he's
going
at
it
from
both
ways,
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that
remains
to
be
proved.
i
would
say
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint
says,
yes;
that
he
is
alleging
the
discharge
as
a
separate
violation,
separate
discriminatory
act.
one
of
the
problems
obviously
with
this
case
is
it's
been
ruled
on
on
the
pleadings
alone.
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
put
forth
his
proof
as
to
whether
the
discharge
itself
was
discriminatory,
whether
he
was
discharged
in
a
manner
in
which
those
who
were
not
of
his
national
origin
were
not
discharged.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
even
though
they
too
had
been
denied
tenure.
that's
correct;
yes.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
process
of,
focused
on
his
discharge
and
said
it
occurred
on
the
last
day
that
he
worked,
and
said
that
what
he
was
complaining
about
overall
was
the
process
which
resulted
in
that,
and
said
that
that
was
a
continuing,
ongoing
process.
it's
not
clear
which
acts
they
picked
out
as
being
part
of
that
process
but
they
looked
at
the
period
from
june
26,
1974,
to
june
30,
1975,
when
he
ceased
working,
as
being
a
period
in
which
that
process
was
ongoing
and
resulted
in
the
termination
of
his
employment
on
6-30-75.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
he
filed
his
charge
within
180
days.
i
believe
that--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--all
right.
but
i
believe
that
if
this
court
finds
that
he
didn't,
i
believe
that
he
was
timely
because
of
the
300-day
rule.
the
respondent
filed
a
supplemental
brief
after
the
mohasco
case
came
down.
in
that
case,
the
court
will
recall
that
no
filing
could
occur
with
eeoc
until
there
had
been,
where
there
was
a
state
agency
that
had
a
local
law
prohibiting
discrimination;
that
no
filing
could
occur
with
eeoc
until
the
state
had
been
given
the
opportunity
to
look
at
that
charge,
and
that
the
time
limits
were
either
60
days
after
the
state
had
received
the
filing
or
30
days
after
the
termination
of
the
proceeding,
assuming
that
that
60-day
period
was
not
exceeded.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
believe
it
did.
i
believe
footnote
19
in
mohasco,
i
believe
it's
footnote
19,
speaks
to
that
issue
when
it
talks
about
whether
or
not
charge
has
to
be
filed
within
180
days.
it
makes
specific
reference
to
olson
v.
rembrandt
publishing
company,
i
believe.
but
it
doesn't
say...
it
says
clearly
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
filed
within
180
days,
and
it
suggests
in
that
footnote
that
the
charge
doesn't
have
to
be
filed
timely
with
the
state.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out,
justice
rehnquist,
that
there's
some
question
as
to
whether
dr.
ricks's
charge
was
untimely
with
the
state.
what
the
state
did
with
that
charge
was
to
waive
jurisdiction
over
to
the
eeoc,
and
i'd
submit
that
the
waiver
of
jurisdiction,
inherent
in
that
waiver
is
the
power
to
review
the
charge.
the
state
assumed
that
it
had
jurisdiction,
it
didn't
dismiss
the
charge
as
an
untimely
charge.
clearly
that
was
not
the
case.
what
it
did
was,
it
simply
waived
over
to
the
eeoc.
so
that
if
you
pick
up
on
the
mohasco
theory,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
count
that
300
days
from
the
point
at
which,
the
earliest
point
at
which
dr.
ricks
could
have
filed
his
charge
with
the
eeoc.
that
date
would
have
been
april
28,
1975.
you
count
back
300
days,
there
are
a
number
of
acts
that
occurred,
that
in
and
of
themselves
might,
would
be
timely.
you
go
back
to
july
2,
1974.
clearly
the
notice
of
nonrenewal
on
6-26-74
would
not
be
included,
but,
as
in
the
supplemental
brief,
i
indicated
the
contract
that
was
referred
to
in
that
notice
was
signed
by
the
college
president
on
behalf
of
the
college
on
august
16,
1974,
and
it
was
executed
by
dr.
ricks
on
september
3,
1974.
those
two
dates
are
within
the
300-day
period,
if
you
assume
the
mohasco
reading.
in
addition,
the
college
issued
to
dr.
ricks
a
notice
that
tenure
had
in
fact
been
denied.
after
the
review
of
the
educational
policy
decision,
the
board
had
decided
to
deny
him
tenure
and
that
notice
was
issued
on
september
12,
1974.
again,
for
purposes
of
title
vii,
if
you
assume
the
mohasco
treatment
of
the
case
and
the
300
days
applies,
that
september
12,
1974,
date
is
within
the
300-day
period.
i
might
also
add
that
it's
within
the
three-year
period
for
purposes
of
section
1981.
we
both
agree,
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
a
three-year
delaware
statute
of
limitations
that
applied
to
the
1981
claim,
that
the
court
complaint
was
filed
on
september
9,
1977,
and
if
you
go
back
three
years
to
september
9,
1974,
clearly
the
college
issued
its
letter
on
september
12,
'74
and
that
period
is
within
the
three-year
period.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
there
are
some
allegations
of
events
that
occurred
after
the--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--those
specific
events,
yes,
except
insofar
as
the
person
who
allegedly
engaged
in
that
conduct
subsequently
evaluated
him
in
that
last
year
of
the
contract.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
no,
no,
it's
not
alleged
as
a
cause
of
action
under
title
vii.
it
is
an
evidentiary
matter.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
the
charge
of
discrimination
filed
by
dr.
ricks
before
the
eeoc
and
which
is
a
part
of
this
record
alleges
a
discriminatory
discharge
from
his
employment.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
paragraph
48,
justice
powell,
i
believe,
is
the
paragraph
that
does
that...
paragraph
48.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
the
count
two
of
the
complaint
says
that
all
the
allegations
numbered
1
through...
however
many
of
them
are...
i
think
48
is
the
last
one,
are
alleged
to
be
discriminatory
and
in
violation
of
section
1981.
and
that
would
include
the
discriminatory
discharge.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that
said
that...
some
allegations
separate
and
apart
from
the
tenure?
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint
is
that
most
of
the
allegations
do
go
to
tenure;
yes,
that's
correct.
there
are
no
allegations
separate
and
apart
from
those
other
than
that
one
paragraph
48
that
talks
about
discriminatory
discharge.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
a
question
that
would
remain
to
be
proved,
and
it
is
a
question
at
this
point.
i
think
that
the
college
has
taken
the
position
that
because
he
was
awarded
a
terminal
contract,
he
would
automatically
leave.
i
think
the
complaint
alleges,
and
if
allowed
to
be
put
to
the
proof,
dr.
ricks
would
attempt
to
show
that
he
had
been
previously
denied
tenure
and
although
under
the
college
regulations
that
previous
denial
of
tenure
required
the
issuance
of
a
terminal
contract
and
certain
treatment
prescribed
in
the
college's
regulations,
that
did
not
in
fact
occur.
that
being
the
prior
case,
i
think
it
remains
a
question
as
to
whether
he
would
have
automatically
ceased
to
be
employed
with
the
college
simply
because
he
was
awarded
what's
called
the
terminal
contract.
in
addition
a--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--yes,
it
was.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that
is
correct.
his
employment
did
come
to
an
end
on
june
30,
'75.
he
had
a
series
of
one
year
contracts.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
no.
throughout
his...
there
was,
from
june
30--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--that's
correct.
but
there
were
a
series
of
one
year
contracts
under
which
he
was
employed.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
practice.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
suppose
so.
i
don't
know
that
that's
been
the
experience
at
delaware
stare
college,
but--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--that's
probably
true.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
been
the
way--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--no,
it
did
not
say
that.
the
contract
looked
exactly
like
the
previous
one
year
contracts
he'd
been
given.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
because
under
the
regulations
of
the
college...
mr.
rodriguez
is
correct...
upon
that
denial
of
tenure
he
was
to
be
afforded
a
terminal
contract,
and
that
was
deemed
to
be
the
terminal
contract.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
well,
i
think
that--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--that's
correct.
i
don't
think,
though,
that
the
issuance
of
the
contract
necessarily
meant
that
he
would
not
be
working
there
after
june
30,
1975,
and
i
say
that--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--that's
what
it
ordinarily
means
but
i
would
say,
justice
white,
that
the--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--well,
what
the
notice,
the
june
26
notice
that
preceded
the
issuance
of
the
terminal
contract
said
was
that,
we're
issuing
you
this
contract
to
comply
with
the
aaup
regulations.
however,
if
the
board
of
trustees
decides
to
grant
you
tenure,
this
action
will
be
superseded.
so
i
think
that
by
the
very
issuance
of
that
letter
the
question
was
created
as
to
whether
he
would
remain
on
the
faculty.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
and
by
september
12,
'74,
that
had
happened.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
the
issuance
of
a
terminal
contract,
mr.
chief
justice?
yes,
it
is.
i
think
it's
a
very
common
practice
in
academic
institutions.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
it
may
be,
depending
on
why
the
notice
was
given.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
to
find
other
employment?
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
yes.
the
end
of...
the
point
at
which
he
ceases
to
work.
in
this
case
it
was
the
end
of
the
notice
period.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
that
is
my
position.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that
question
does
remain.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
right.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
yes,
i
think
you
would
be
required
to
do
that,
and
that
this
court
should
not
decide
that.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--is
incorrect.
that's
correct.
yes,
justice
brennan.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
i
did
want
to
comment,
i
think
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question
as
to
whether
dr.
ricks
was
a
united
states
citizen.
he
is
a
united
states
citizen.
i
believe
that
was
a
question
that
you
earlier
posed
to
mr.
rodriguez.
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
that.
the
question
of
when
a
discharge
occurs
has
been
addressed
by
this
court
on
several
occasions
before
and
i
believe
that
in
the
context
of
title
vii
as
well
as
in
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
this
court
has
held
and
courts
below
have
held
that
discharge
occurs
on
the
last
day
of
work.
i
think
that
that's
what
happened
in
i.u.e.
vs.
robbins
&
myers,
where
the
question
was
whether
a
grievance
procedure
tolled
the
title
vii
time
limitation.
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
the
time
for
filing
the
charge
ran
from
the
last
day
that
the
employee
worked
and
not
from
the
later
point
when
the
grievance
was
concluded,
a
point
at
which
he
was
off
the
payroll.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
no,
i'm
simply
saying
that...
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
at
all.
i
think
that
this
situation
is
simply
a
question
of
focusing
on
when
the
discharge
occurred,
from
the
perspective
of
the
respondent.
and
i
believe
that
that
discharge
and
what's
commonly
understood
in
title
vii
law
to
be
the
point
of
discharge
is
the
point
at
which
an
employee
ceases
to
work.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
decides
this
case
differently
and
decides
that
the
june
26,
'74,
date
is
the
date
at
which
discharge
occurred
or
the
violation
occurred,
that
it
will
be
carving
out
an
exception
either
for
academic
institutions
or
perhaps
for
institutions
that
choose
to
give
employees
notice
of
the
fact
that
their
employment
is
coming
to
an
end.
i
think
a
better
rule
is
the
rule
of
the
employee's
remaining
on
the
job
and
the
point
at
which
the
work
terminates,
that
that's
a
point
from
which
violation
of
termination
or
discharge
can
properly
be
alleged.
i
think
there's
no
prejudice
suffered
by
an
employer
in
this
situation
because
employers
naturally
maintain
records
of
employees
that
they
have
on
the
rolls.
they
can
defend.
the
claim
really
isn't
stale.
if
you're
talking
about
the
termination
of
employment,
they
can
defend,
they
have
the
records
available,
and
they
know
that
they
only
have
to
defend
up
to
either
180
days
or,
if
this
court
so
decides,
300
days
of
the
date
of
discharge,
so
that
the
claim
really
isn't
stale.
attention's
been
called
to
the
fact
that
two
of
the
witnesses
are
unavailable.
one
of
them
is
deceased...
one
died
during
the
course
of
the
appeal,
not
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding
in
the
trial
court.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that
problem
might
be
created
but
what
colleges
could
do
in
response
to
that
is
simply
maintain
the
records.
the
witnesses
might
disappear
and
they
might
die
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
records
of
the
tenure
process
and
the
denial
of
it
and
the
reasons
for
it
could
be
maintained
in
the
college
archives
or
in
the
college
records,
and
used
in
support
of
the
college's
position
that
denial
of
tenure
was
appropriate.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that
could
be.
yes,
i
would
have
to
say
that
that's
possible
but
it
might
be
possible
for
colleges
to
simply
hold
their
proceedings
as
they
did
here
in
the
educational
policy
committee.
there
were
transcripts
of
a
hearing
made,
and
witnesses
came
in
and
they
got
to
do
it
in
the
form
of
testimony,
and
to
submit
evidence.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
believe
it
does.
i
believe
that
the
violation,
the
ultimate
termination
of
dr.
ricks,
was
a
discriminatory
act.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
right
was
violated
then,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
it
was.
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
giving
of
notice
was
a
discriminatory
act
and
that
notice
was
not
given
under
similar
circumstances
to
those
people
who
were
not
of
dr.
ricks's
national
origin.
it
may
very
well
be
that
notice
was
given
to
everyone
in
those
circumstances.
on
the
other
hand--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--i
don't
believe
so,
if
the
allegation
is
that
the
discharge,
the
ultimate
act
of
terminating
the
employee
on
the
day
he
or
she
last
worked
is
the
discriminatory
conduct.
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
giving
of
notice
is,
or
some
event
that
occurred
in
any
of
those
five
years,
but
that,
it
seems
to
me,
goes
to
what
issues
or
what
claims
the
court's
going
to
give
relief
on,
versus
whether
or
not
the
court...
the
party
is
properly
in
court
to
assert
some
of
that
claim.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
oh,
that's
a
harder
problem.
that
looks
more
like
the
effects
of
discrimination
than
it
does
an
active
discriminatory
act.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
don't
agree
that
that
is
this
case.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
yes.
that's
correct.
he
filed
his
charge
in
anticipation
of
his
employment
ending
on
june
30,
1975.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
happened
in
noble
vs.
rochester,
a
2nd
circuit
case,
and
i
think
it
happened
in
egelston
vs.
state
university
at
geneseo.
that's
precisely
what
happened.
two
charging
parties
filed
their
charges
with
eeoc
in
anticipation
of
the
discriminatory
act
taking
place.
they
knew
they'd
been...
in
one
instance
removed
from
a
position
and
asked
to
train
someone
else,
and
the
court
found
in
that
case
that
the
time
really
started
to
run
from
the
point
at
which
that
person
assumed
the
job.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
the
rationale
of
the
3rd
circuit?
yes,
i
am.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
no,
it
said
the
process
of
termination
was
a
continuing
process.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
it
said
it
began
on
june
26,
'74.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
no,
i
don't
believe
a
1990
claim
would
be
timely
if
there's
no
difference
between
the
discriminatory
denial
of
seniority
and
tenure.
i
think
they
would
be
treated
the
same
but
i
don't
think
the
1990
claim
would
be
timely.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
i
believe
that
the
1990
claim,
to
the
extent
that
it
alleged
a
discriminatory
denial
of
seniority
resulting
in
a
layoff
or
an
earlier
termination
than
would
otherwise
have
occurred,
would
be
like
united
air
lines
vs.
evans,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what's
alleged
here.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct;
they
did.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
correct.
i
was
assuming...
i
misunderstood
your
hypothetical.
i
was
assuming
that
the
employment
had
terminated.
i
jumped
the
gun;
i'm
sorry.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
in
thinking
about
it,
in
both
instances
would
say
that
the
1990
charge
was
a
timely
charge.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
think
they
would.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
i
believe
that
the
statute
starts
to
run,
assuming
the
employee
stays
at
work,
at
the
point
at
which
it
has
an
adverse
impact
on
the
employee,
the
point
at
which
either
he
is
precluded
from
advancing
because
of
seniority
because
someone
else
was
put
into
the
position,
or
precluded
from
getting
a
higher
salary
because
that
job
grade,
for
example,
might
have
been
upgraded
and
people
who
were
higher
level
than
he
or
she
would
get
a
raise
that
that
person
would
not
get.
i
think
it's
the
point
at
which
the
adverse--
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
--yes,
i
believe
i
must,
and
i
do.
ms.
miss
judith
e.
harris
that's
right.
it
could
be.
could
very
well
be,
in
a
very
static
employment
situation.
i
believe
i've
concluded
my
remarks,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
