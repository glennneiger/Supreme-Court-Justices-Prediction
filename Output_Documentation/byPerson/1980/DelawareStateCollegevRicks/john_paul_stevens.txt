mr.
rodriguez,
following
up
on
justice
stewart's
suggestion,
it
depends
a
little
bit
on
the
way
the
complaint
is
written.
if
we
put
to
one
side
equitable
relief,
an
injunction
requiring
tenure,
say,
and
just
look
at
the
damage
action,
i
suppose
normally
a
cause
of
action
doesn't
accrue
until
all
the
elements
of
the
damage
claimed
are
present.
and
he
didn't
suffer
any
monetary
damage
until
he
stopped
working
for
the
college,
did
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
wouldn't
his
damage
claim
have
been
premature
if
he'd
brought
suit
before,
while
they
still
had
him
on
the
payroll?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
he
could
have
sued
for
an
injunction,
i
suppose,
a
grant
retenure,
but
he
couldn't
have
recovered
any
money,
could
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
he
sued
and
30
days
later
the
case
came
on
for
trial,
he
wouldn't
go
to
judgment,
would
he?
he's
still
working.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes.
and
so,
if
he
brought
suit
on
january
1,
1975,
say,
he
was
still
on
the
payroll.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
beg
the
question?
because
if
the
only
discriminatory
act
is
denying
tenure
which
automatically
results
in
discharge
a
year
and
a
half
later,
can
one
claim
that's
a
termination
for
a
discriminatory
act
and
not
time-barred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that
that
would
just
beg
the
question,
when
you
phrase
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
miss
harris,
for
purposes
of
statute
of
limitations
analysis,
is
there
any
difference
in
your
view
between
the
discriminatory
act
denying
tenure
and
a
discriminatory
act
denying
seniority,
or
refusing
to
grant
some
special,
better
seniority?
if
there's
not,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
3rd
circuit
rationale
you
might
have
a
case
arguably
in
which
there
was
a
clear
proof
of
discriminatory
denial
of
seniority,
say,
in
1974,
resulting
in
an
early
discharge
in
1990,
with
nothing
happening
in
between.
and
under
that
rationale,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
1990
claim
would
be
timely.
do
i
misread
the
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
really
be
the
same
as
united
air
lines,
because
there
there's
been
the...
i'm
assuming
continuous
employment.
you
did
not
have
continuous
employment
in
the
evans
case.
the
woman
left
and
then
came
back,
whereas
here
the
test
of
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it
is,
the
discharge
is
the
event
that
triggers
the
running
of
the
statute
and
that
he
had
no
separation
of
employment
before
1990,
which
is
quite
different
from
evans.
i
think
they
distinguish
evans
on
the
ground
that
you
have
continuous
employment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
assuming,
in
my
seniority
case,
continuous
employment.
and
so
i
don't
think
you
can
answer
it
by
saying,
well,
evans
would
apply
there.
i
don't...
if
evans
applies
there,
in
other
words,
i
think
it
may
well
apply
here.
that's
what
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
i
think
they
would.
