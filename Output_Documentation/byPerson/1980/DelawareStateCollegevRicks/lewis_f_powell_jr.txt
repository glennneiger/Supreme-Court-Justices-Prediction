miss
harris,
before
you
go
on,
could
we
come
back
to
the
complaint
for
a
minute
or
two?
i
had
thought
the
charge
was
related
solely
to
the
denial
of
tenure.
then,
if
i
understand
that
you
are
saying
that
actually
the
denial
was
based
on
an
unlawful
discharge.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
appreciate
that
the
complaint
is
long
and
perhaps
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be.
could
you
identify
the
paragraphs
in
the
complaint
that
do
not
relate
to
tenure
and
specifically
aver
a
discharge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
says
he
was
discharged.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
apart
from
that,
there's
no
specific
averment
of
discriminatory
discharge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
there
are
15
or
16
paragraphs
that
talk
about
tenure,
so
i
was
under
the
impression
until
this
morning
that
your
contention
was
based
on
the
denial
of
tenure,
but
i'll
take
another
look
at
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
respondent
have
remained
on
the
faculty
without
tenure?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
next
case,
79-939,
delaware
state
college
against
ricks,
a
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
this
involves
the
denial
of
academic
tenure
by
delaware
state
college
to
a
faculty
member.
it
presents
a
question
as
to
the
effective
date
of
this
denial
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
the
faculty
member
suit
was
timely
filed.
he
sought
relief
both
under
title
vii
and
under
42
u.s.c.
(a),
section
1981.
the
district
court
dismissed
respondent's
complaint
as
untimely,
but
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
reversed,
the
facts
are
set
forth
fully
in
our
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
and
may
not
be
stated
in
detail.
in
brief
summary,
the
faculty
committee
on
promotions
and
tenure
recommended
denial.
the
full
faculty
senate
agreed
and
the
board
of
trustee
is
formally
voted
not
to
grant
tenure.
respondent
as
permitted
by
college
rules
filed
a
grievance
seeking
reconsideration.
in
due
of
the
official
denial
of
tenure,
the
board
in
accordance
with
its
normal
practice
offered
respondent
a
1-year
terminal
contract
that
respondent
accepted.
the
question
before
us
was
which
of
several
days
was
determinative
with
respect
to
the
running
of
statutes
of
limitation.
we
hold
that
the
controlling
date
was
no
later
than
june
26,
1974
when
respondent
was
advised
formally
of
the
official
denial
and
that
he
was
being
offered
a
terminal
contract.
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
date
should
be
the
last
date
of
employment
under
the
terminal
contract.
we
also
reject
the
argument
that
at
least
it
should
have
been
no
earlier
than
when
respondent's
grievance
eventually
was
denied.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stewart
joined
by
justice
brennan,
and
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
stevens
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
