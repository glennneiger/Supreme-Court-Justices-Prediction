we'll
near
arguments
next
in
delaware
state
college
v.
ricks.
mr.
rodriguez,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

miss
harris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
complaint
as
you
have
outlined
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
in
your
view
just
a
traditional
method
of
giving
the
faculty
member
a
year's
time
to
find
new
employment,
and
a
year's
notice,
in
effect,
that
at
the
end
of
the
year
there
would
be
no
more
employment
at
this
institution?
is
that
what
it
amounts
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
fundamentally
any
different
from
ordinary
workers
in
industry
that
might
get
15-day
or
30-day
notice
that
their
employment
is
terminated,
but
they
have
the
employment
during
that
15
or
30-day
period?
is
it
essentially
the
same
in
operation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it's
either
a
layoff
or
for
cause,
whatever,
is
that
not
the
function
of
it,
to
give
the
person
a
turnaround
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
your
view,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
tolled
until
the
end
of
the
notice
period
rather
than
the
beginning
of
the
notice
period.
isn't
that
the
essence
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
point
of
termination
of
the
contractual
relationship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
situation
is
analogous
to
a
grievance
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
might
there
not
be
considerable
evidence
that
wouldn't
be
a
matter
of
record,
something
in
people's
memories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
positions
apparently
equate
the
existence
of
a
contract
with
the
execution
of
it.
that
is,
you're
placing
the
statute
to
running
date
from
the
last
day
of
work
as
distinguished
from
the
notice
of
termination
of
the
contract.
that
wipes
out
the
significance
of
the
notice,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
haven't
the
rights...
whatever
the
right
is,
hasn't
it
been
violated
as
soon
as
the
notice
is
given
that
the
contract
is
terminated,
even
though
the
work
may
continue
for
six
months,
12
months,
or
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
a
number
of
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
a
little
difficult
to
square
with
the
general
idea
of
staleness
in
the
prosecution
of
claims?
take
the
five-year
illustration
that
was
suggested
hypothetically
by
justice
rehnquist.
it's
a
pretty
stale
claim
if
the
statute
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
end
of
the
five
years
of
actual
work,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pose
a
variation
of
that,
an
alleged
unlawful
discriminatory
denial
of
seniority.
that
is,
the
statute
would
begin
to
run
at
the
time
the
seniority
is
denied,
or
on
the
first
occasion
when
the
denial
of
that
seniority
has
some
impact
on
the
employee,
by
way
of
either
not
getting
promoted
or
not
getting
an
assignment
or
an
increase
in
salary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
must
take
that
position
to
support
your
other
positions,
must
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
a
small
plant,
a
small
industrial
operation,
that
might
be
a
long,
long
time
before
there
was
any
impact,
would
it
not,
could
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
