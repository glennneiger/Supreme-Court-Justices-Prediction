justice
potter
stewart
so
it
wasn't
a
timely
state
filing?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
depends
upon
whether
there
was
a
state
filing.
by
180
days
or
300
days.
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
there
was
a
state
filing.
is
that
it?
justice
stewart
is
that
a
rule
of
this
court?
justice
stewart
could
it
be
plain
error?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
amicus
does
think
it
makes
a
difference.
so
that
injects
another
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
also
have
the
1981
claim
here,
which
isn't
governed
at
all
by
that,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
court.
and
that's
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
mr.
ricks
a
united
states
citizen
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was...
both
the
briefs
of
the
parties
and
the
amicus
briefs
kind
of
talk
about
this
as
an
all-or-nothing
situation,
but
it
really
depends,
doesn't
it,
upon
what
the
complaint
is,
what
the
complaint
is?
and
if
the
complaint
is
for
wrongful
discharge,
based
upon
a
person's
national
origin,
then
the
question
is,
when
did
the
discharge
occur?
if
on
the
other
hand
the
claim
is
for
a
wrongful
denial
of
tenure
based
upon
a
person's
national
origin,
the
question
is,
when
did
the
denial
of
tenure
take
place?
you
can't
generalize
it.
you
have
to
look
at
the
complaint
and
see
what
the
alleged
discrimination
was,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
read
this
complaint?
is
it
a
claim
of
wrongful
discharge?
ultimately,
is
that
one
of
the
claims?
wrongful
discharge
based
upon
the
plaintiff's
national
origin?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
insofar
as
he
alleged
that
he
was
terminated
by
reason
of
his
national
origin,
then
the
question
is,
when
was
he
terminated,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
alleges
that
he
was
denied
tenure
on
account
of
his
national
origin,
then
the
question
is,
when
was
he
denied
tenure?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
claims
that
he
was
denied
a
promotion,
when
was
he
denied
the
promotion?
or
denied
a
job,
when
was
he
denied
the
job?
you
can't
generalize
about
these
things,
you
have
to
look
and
see
what
the
complaint
is,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
which
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
end
of
the
line.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
that
the
question?
isn't
that
the
dispositive
question?
what
is
the
alleged
discriminatory
act?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it
was
a
denial
of
hiring
or
a
denial
of
transfer,
a
denial
of
promotion,
in
this
case
a
denial
of
tenure,
and/or
maybe
of
firing.
and
the
question
is
to
determine
which,
or
maybe
it's
both.
justice
potter
stewart
she
couldn't
have
been
persecuted
when
she
wasn't
there.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
does
have
significance
if
the
basic
claim
is
that
he
was
fired
by
reason
of
his
national
origin.
then
the
question
is,
was
he
fired
and
when?
that's
the
first
question.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
two
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
his
claim
of
alleged
discrimination
is
that
he
was
denied
tenure,
then
the
question
becomes,
when
was
he
denied
tenure?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
from
then.
justice
potter
stewart
if
his
claim
is
that
he
was
wrongfully
discharged,
then
the
question
is,
was
he
discharged,
when,
and
if
you'd
answer
those
two
questions,
then
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
from
the
time
he
was
discharged.
justice
potter
stewart
so
one
must
look
to
the
complaint
in
every
case,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
can
be
violations
of
title
vii
by
somebody
who
never
leaves
the
employment.
i
mean,
the
violation
might
be
a
failure
to
promote.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
could
be
violations
of
title
vii
by
somebody
who
never
becomes
an
employee.
the
violation
might
be
a
failure
to
hire.
so,
you
can't
have
a
general
rule,
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
some
of
these
amicus
briefs
seem
to
have
come
in
for.
justice
stewart
but
he
knew
that
that
terminal
contract
was
only
for
one
year.
justice
stewart
if
he
had...
knew
it
too,
that
would
have
been
admitted
or
conceded
or
stipulated
in
any
action
for
damages.
he
would
have
been
suing
for
anticipatory
breach,
in
effect,
future
damages.
justice
stewart
well,
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
possibly
meant
that?
justice
stewart
if
the
alleged
discriminatory
act
is
a
failure
to
promote,
based
upon
somebody's
race,
sex,
or
national
origin,
then
that's
the
act,
and
it
becomes
important
to
determine,
first,
did
that
act
occur?
secondly,
when
did
it
occur?
and
then
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
and
then
if
you
find
that
it
is
within
the
statute,
then
you
consider
the
merits
of
the
claim.
but
it
has...
that
alleged
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
termination.
justice
stewart
and
how
about
a
failure
to
hire?
you
couldn't
possibly
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
when
the
person
was
fired
if
he
was
never
hired.
justice
stewart
well,
that
is
the
date
when
the
statute
starts
to
run
if
the
alleged
discrimination
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
firing,
if
he
allegedly
was
fired
because
he
or
she,
the
plaintiff--
justice
stewart
--of
a
certain
sex
or
a
certain
race
or
a
certain
ethnic
origin.
but
if
that's
not
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint,
then
that
that's
not
where
the
statute
begins
to
run.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
claim
can
be
read
as
one
that
the
plaintiff
was
unlawfully
terminated
from
his
employment
by
reason
of
his
national
origin,
then
he
might
prevail,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
would
then
begin
to
run
at
the
time
he
was
terminated
from
his
employment,
and
if
he
can
show
that
the
reason
he
was
terminated
was
because
of
his
national
origin,
then
he
might
prevail
under
title
vii,
quite
apart
from
1981.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
only
discriminatory
act
fairly
alleged
is
a
failure
to
give
him
tenure?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
as
i
say,
his
claim
is...
and
if
he
can
prevail
on
it...
that
he
was
terminated
by
reason
of
his
national
origin,
then
he
might
win,
although
judge
higginbotham
of
the
3rd
circuit
says
that
his
claim
was
that
he
was
denied
tenure.
now,
if
the
claim
can
be
shown
to
be
one
of
unlawful
termination
by
reason
of
national
origin,
then
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
at
the
time
of
termination,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
the
claim--
justice
potter
stewart
--but
if
the
claim
can
be
fairly
so
characterized,
then
he,
as
my
brother
rehnquist
suggested
in
his
question,
he
might
prevail
for
a
reason
other
than
the
broad
reasoning
of
judge
higginbotham
for
the
3rd
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
be
the
merits
of
the
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
if
his
claim
is
that
he
was
wrongfully
terminated
by
reason
of
his
national
origin,
then
the
merits
would
be
whether
or
not
that
was
correct.
justice
stewart
it
wasn't
discretionary
on
the
part
of
the
college?
justice
stewart
the
college
had
to
offer
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
little
hard
to...
maybe
it
is
a
fair
reading,
is
it?
i
find
the
complaint
a
little
hard
to
read.
justice
potter
stewart
i
find
the
complaint
a
little
hard
to
read
either
your
way
or
any
other
way,
frankly,
so
maybe
it
was
a
very
fair
reading.
justice
stewart
then
you
have
something
in
your
brief
about
his
being
punched
in
the
nose.
justice
stewart
but
those
events
really
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
title
vii,
do
they?
they
would...
they're
assault
and
battery
if
true.
justice
stewart
well,
that
might
be
evidentiary
but
it's
not
itself
a
substantive
cause
of
action
under
title
vii.
justice
stewart
it
was
a
one
year
contract?
justice
stewart
and
there
was
no
offer
of
a
second
one
year
contract?
justice
stewart
i
thought
there
was
a
single
one
year
contract,
at
the
end?
justice
stewart
well,
of
course
at
the
end
there
was.
justice
stewart
but
i
thought
after
the
second
denial
of
tenure
there
was
a
single
one
year
contract?
justice
stewart
i
suppose
a
nontenured
teacher,
though,
could
have
a
five-year
contract?
justice
stewart
as
an
instructor
or
an
assistant
professor,
or
whatever.
justice
stewart
getting
back
to
justice
powell's
question,
it
seems
to
be
clear,
at
least
in
the
first
sentence
of
judge
higginbotham's
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
that
that
court
considered
your
complaint
to
allege
a
discriminatory
denial
of
tenure.
and
"denial
of
tenure",
that
ends
the
sentence,
first
sentence
of
the
opinion,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
then
he
goes
on,
the
opinion
goes
on
at
some
length
to
talk
about
the
whole
history
and
then
ending
up
with
the
termination,
and
then
holding,
as
we
know
it
held,
as
to
when
the
statute
of
limitations
began.
justice
stewart
but
the
question
is
still
whether
it
was
180
days
or
300-day
statute.
justice
stewart
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
it
was
180
days?
justice
stewart
both
parties
assumed
it
was
180
days.
now
there
seems
to
be
a
possibility
that
it
was
a
300-day
statute.
should
we
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
that
question?
because
the
answer
to
the
question
seems
to
depend
upon
whether
or
not
there
was
a
filing
in
the
state,
with
the
state
commission.
justice
stewart
well,
mr.
rodriguez
says
that's
precisely
this
case.
justice
stewart
well,
under
the
logic
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
my
brother
stevens
suggests
that
it
would
be.
justice
stewart
i
do,
too.
