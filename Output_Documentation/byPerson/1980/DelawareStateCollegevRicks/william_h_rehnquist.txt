justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
we
generally
have
a
rule
that
amicus
curiae
can't
inject
a
new
issue
into
the
case
that
has
not
been
argued
by
the
parties
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rodriguez,
procedurally
this
case
was
dismissed
by
and
not
tried
by
the
district
court,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
and
then
on
an
appeal
with
3rd
circuit
that
court
reversed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
complaint
stated
a
claim
both
for
denial
of
a
contract
to
teach
and
tenure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
timely
filing
with
the
state
agency
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
possible
that
even
though
the
3rd
circuit
was
wrong
in
laying
down
a
general
rule,
the
plaintiff
might
prevail
on
this
particular
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
he
claim
that
the
discharge
was
discriminatory
for
any
other
reason
than
that
the
tenure
denial
was
discriminatory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
they
too
had
been
denied
tenure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
mohasco
included
an
untimely
filing
with
the
state
commission
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
is
the
difference
between
tenure
and
a
series
of
one
year
contracts,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
teachers
generally
who
do
not
have
tenure
are
operating
under
a
year-to-year
contract
and
then
when
they
get
tenure
they
no
longer
have
to
depend
on
a
one
year
contract.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
miss
harris,
supposing
that
it
was
agreed
that
your
sole
claim
was
denial
of
tenure
and
not
denial
of
a
contract
to
work,
and
that
the
university
policy
was
to
give
the
faculty
member
who
had
been
finally
denied
tenure
a
five-year
contract
of
employment
and
tell
him
that
that
was
the
terminal
contract.
then
you
really
would
run
into
problems
of
disappearance
of
witnesses
and
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
took
the
date
of...
the
last
date
of
employment
rather
than
the
date
on
which
the
discriminatory
denial
of
tenure
became
final,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
you
were
claiming
that
the
denial
of
tenure
was
discriminatory
but
that
everything
that
happened
after
the
denial
of
tenure
was
not
discriminatory,
that
your
client
was
treated
just
the
way
everybody
else
who
was
denied
tenure
was,
although
the
denying
of
tenure
had
been
discriminatory.
would
you
still
say
that
the
statute
ran
from
the
time
he
last
occupied
a
desk
in
the
university?
