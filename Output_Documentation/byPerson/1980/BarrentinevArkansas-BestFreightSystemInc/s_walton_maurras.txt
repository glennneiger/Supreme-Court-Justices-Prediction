mr.
s.
walton
maurras
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
purpose
for
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
to
protect
the
unorganized
worker
and
it
was
not
to
protect
organized
labor.
this
purpose
is
implicit
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
was
exemplified
in
the
exchange
in
the
senate
between
mr.
walsh
and
mr.
black
in
which
the
question
was
asked,
if
upon
the
adoption
of
the
flsa
it
would
have
any
effect
on
existing
or
on
future
collective
bargaining
agreements?
and
the
negative
response
was
given.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
it
was,
your
honor.
however,
nothing...
to
the
contrary,
the
statute
was
left
silent
as
to
whether
it
was
exclusive
for
unorganized
labor
or
included
both.
it
did
not
thereafter
go
and
specifically
address
the
question.
this
court,
subsequent
to
the
adoption
of
the
act
in
the
brooklyn
savings
bank
case,
acknowledged
the
fact
that
the
purpose
for
the
act
was
to
protect
the
unorganized
worker.
and
although
subsequent
to
the
brooklyn
savings
bank
case
this
court
decided
in
jewel
ridge
and
in
the
anderson
v.
mt.
clemens
case
that
acts
which
had
not
previously
been
determined
to
be
work
or
compensable
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
were
compensable
under
the
flsa.
congress
responded
to
the
decisions
of
the
court
by
adopting
the
portal-to-portal
pay
act,
and
in
so
doing
stated
in
its
findings
and
purposes
that
it
was
necessary
to
adopt
that
act
because
of
judicial
interpretation
that
were
in
disregard
of
the
customs,
practices,
and
contracts
between
employers
and
employees.
again,
the
court,
subsequent
to
the
portal-to-portal
act,
decided
the
case
of
bay
ridge
in
which
the
court
stated
that
the
flsa
required
that
certain
activity
be
treated
as
overtime
which
had
not
been
treated
as
overtime
in
the
contract.
the
result
of
the
decision
was
to
have
the
payment
of
flsa
overtime
on
top
of
contractual
overtime.
congress
again
responded
to
that
decision
of
the
court
with
the
overtime-on-overtime
act,
and
in
its
statement
of
findings
for
the
necessity
of
the
act
said
that
the
claims
which
had
resulted
from
the
court's
decision
were
windfalls
and
were
in
derogation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
they
were
understood
by
the
parties.
congress
also
said
that
the
arrangements
for
the
overtime
was
the
result
of
collective
bargaining,
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
other
than
at
arm's
length.
so
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
because
of
the
subsequent
actions
of
congress
in
trying
to
restrict
the
decisions
so
that
the
flsa
did
not
take
precedence
over
legitimate
bona
fide
collective
bargaining
agreements,
evidences
the
intent
of
congress
to
protect
the
unorganized
worker
as
opposed
to
organized
labor.
the
flsa
itself
does
not
require
that
the
action
for
its
enforcement
be
judicial
in
nature.
section
216(b)
says
that
an
action
for
damages
for
back
wages
or
for
liquidated
damages
may
be
brought
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
use
the
mandatory
"shall".
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
alternate
forms.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
prohibit
alternate
forms,
it
certainly
could
have
done
so,
as
it
did
in
the
securities
act,
and
said
that
you
cannot...
specifically...
cannot
waive
any
of
the
rights
accorded.
in
donahue
v.
susquehanna
collieries,
that
court
acknowledged
this
idea
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
exclude
arbitration
as
a
method
of
resolving
flsa
claims,
that
congress
could
have
specifically
so
stated
in
the
act.
now,
the
petitioners
have
stated
in
their
reply
brief
that
donahue
is
clouded.
then
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that
cloud
is
more
apparent
than
real.
the
cases
the
petitioners
cite
as
creating
a
cloud
in
fact
state
that
the
arbitration
act
cannot
be
used
to
enforce
employment
contracts.
they
do
not
go
beyond
that
holding.
there
is
nothing
in
the
holdings
which
says
that
flsa
claims
cannot
be
arbitrated
if
the
parties
voluntarily
agree
to
it
in
the
context
of
a
bona
fide
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
one
of
the
petitioners'
cases,
the
colonial
hardwood
flooring
case,
that
court
says,
that
while
they
hold
that
the
arbitration
act
is
not
applicable,
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
parties
may
not
voluntarily
agree
to
arbitrate
their
disputes.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
the
policy
considerations
behind
osha
rights
i
think
are
somewhat
different
from
the
policy
considerations
the
congress
may
have
of
the
persons
intended
to
be
protected
in
the
scope
of
the
legislation.
i'm
not
prepared
to
make
a
blanket
statement
but
i
am
prepared
to
state
that
i
believe
that
the
leone
court
is
correct
in
its
holding
that
the
time
spent
in
an
osha
inspection
is
not
compensable
time
under
the
flsa.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
in
what
context?
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
again,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
policy
considerations
expressed
by
congress
as
interpreted
by
this
court
as
to
the
relative
weight
to
be
given
the
statute.
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
that
the
rights
under
the
equal
pay
act
are
subject
to
waiver
or
subject
to
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
so
provide,
your
honor--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--but
if
one
did,
i
would
think--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--yes,
sir.
i
do
not
agree
that
an
arbitrator
cannot
take
into
consideration
the
general
law
of
the
land.
i
think
he
can,
i
think
he
must.
i
don't
think
any
decision
of
this
court
says
that
he
cannot.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
i
was
not
present
during
the
consideration
by
the
board.
all
i
can
state
to
the
court
is--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--as
a
wage
claim?
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
if
the
joint
board
refused
to
acknowledge
the
law
of
the
land,
whatever
that
law
may
be,
if
it
refused
to
acknowledge
the
law,
i
think
it
would
be
wrong.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir,
i
do,
and
i
think
he
could
go
into
court
under
existing
decisions
of
this
court
that
he
had
not
been
fairly
represented,
as
i
think
that
would
clearly
fall
under
the
concept
of
no
fair
representation,
to
which
he
is
entitled.
the
arbitration
provision
in
this
case
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
flsa
claims.
now,
there
have
been
prior
decisions
of
the
court
which
have
said
that
where
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
is
limited,
that
claims
that
arise
under
flsa
would
not
be
considered
because
of
the
limited
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause.
article
44
in
this
contract
says
that
any
controversy
which
may
arise
is
subject
to
the
arbitration.
it's
not
limited
to
controversies
arising
under
the
contract.
article
43
also
provides
that
any
grievance
of
any
employee
will
be
processed.
so
we
have
an
arbitration
clause
that
has
a
very
broad
scope.
there
is
no
limitation
of
what
can
be
presented.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
if
he
did,
he
could,
but
i
submit
to
you
this
committee
would
not
do
that
if
the
time
involved...
and
that's
the
threshold
question--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--i'll
come
to
that
in
my
argument.
but
you
have
to
reach
that
threshold
question
first,
and
in
this
case
the
committee
did
reach
that
threshold
question
and
it
was
decided
adversely
to
the
employees.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir.
so
that
you
never
get
to
the
second
question.
article
50
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
that
the
employees
are
to
be
paid
for
all
time
spent
in
the
service
of
the
employer.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
at
least
as
broad,
if
not
broader,
than
the
flsa
requirement
that
the
employee
be
paid
for
time
worked.
so
that
the
language
of
what
is
required
to
be
paid,
in
the
contract,
is
as
broad
as
what
the
flsa
requires
for
payment.
but
before
you
get
to
that
question,
you
first
have
to
determine,
are
the
acts
that
the
employees
performed
work?
now,
to
do
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
muscoda
test
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
inspection
meets
the
muscoda
requirements.
muscoda
required
that
physical
exertion
be
involved,
that
it
be
under
the
control
of
the
employer,
and
that
it
be
necessarily
and
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
i
submit
to
you
that,
as
to
the
dot
safety
inspection,
at
least
two
of
those
elements
are
not
met.
this
inspection
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
employer.
the
necessity
for
it
is
established
by
the
dot.
the
elements
which
comprise
the
inspection
are
established
by
the
dot.
the
frequency
of
the
inspection
is
prescribed
by
the
dot,
and
the
person
who
makes
the
inspection
is
prescribed
by
the
dot.
so
that...
and
when
the
employee
makes
the
inspection,
as
the
evidence
showed,
he
does
so
at
his
own
pace,
there
is
no
supervision
by
the
company,
he
departs
from
where
he
has
picked
up
his
bills
of
lading,
goes
out
and
at
his
own
leisure
he
makes
his
inspection
and
departs.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
they're
before
the
court
or
not.
in
the--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--in
the
petitioners'
brief
and
in
at
least
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
there
are...
if
they're
not
issues,
they're
gratuitous
statements:
"of
course,
the
time
is
compensable
in
any
event.
"
i
don't
think
that
is
an
accurate
statement.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
as
i
stated,
they
are
mentioned
in
the
briefs
of
the
petitioners,
they
are
mentioned
in
the
amicus
brief.
i
choose
to
address
the
issues
because
i
don't
feel
that
the
time
is
compensable
in
any
event.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
sir?
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
determination
of
whether
the
activities
that
the
employee
has
engaged
in
constitute
time
spent
in
the
service
of
the
employer
are
exactly
the
kind
of
questions
that
arbitrators
have
traditionally
decided.
it's
a
matter
of
hours
worked,
what
constitutes
hours
worked,
it's
a
matter
of
the
law
of
the
shop,
previous
history.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
a
correct
statement
of
my
position.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
you
have
to
come
back
and
keep
in
context
that
the
individual
has
a
right
to
this
fair
representation
by
the
union,
and
if
he...
in
the
context
of
this
contract,
with
the
joint
committee,
you
just
could
not
get
the
result
that
you
have
suggested.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
your
honor.
also,
though,
even
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
arguelles
case,
i
think
the
decision
in
the
instant
case
should
be
affirmed.
now,
arguelles
said
that
the
employee
had
an
option
to
either
proceed
with
his
contract
remedy
of
arbitration
or
to
proceed
under
the
statutory
remedy
and
go
directly
to
court.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
the
decision
does
not
say
this
is
not
compensable
time
under
the
contract.
the
grievance
that
was
submitted,
at
least
one
of
the
grievances
that
was
submitted,
sets
out
a
factual
recitation
of
what
it
is
that
the...
well,
they
all
set
out
just
a
factual
recitation
of
the
events
that
occurred
that
the
employee
claims
to
be
entitled
to
payment
for.
at
least
one
of
the
grievances,
and
it's
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix,
also
states
that
the
time
is
compensable
under
federal
wage
laws
or
federal
work
statutes.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
no,
your
honor,
there
is
none.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
there
is
none.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
what
he
decided
was
that
the
facts
did
not
constitute
time
spent
in
the
service
of
the
employer.
that
is
the
equivalent
of...
that
phrase
is
the
equivalent
of
time
worked.
a
decision
has
been
made
that
the
acts
that
took
place
do
not
constitute
time
worked.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
if
the
factual
basis
for
the
contractual
claim
and
the
factual
basis
for
the
statutory
claim
are
the
same,
then
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
as
to
what
the
effect
of
those
facts
are
should
have
the
same
outcome
as
to
whether
the
claim
is
based
on
the
statute
or
under
the
contract.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
your
honor,
i
do
not
see
that
there
are
different
standards
here.
there's
a
different
rate
of
pay
but
the
standard
is
that
the
employee
be
paid--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--it
may
go
to
the
merits
of
my
claim,
your
honor,
but
my
point
is
that
the
employee
has
had
the
opportunity
to
litigate
or
arbitrate...
and
he
has
made
his
choice...
the
merits
of
his
claim,
and
he
should
not
now
be
given
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
to
relitigate
it
de
novo.
the
trial
court
here,
while
it
did
not
go
into
the
underlying
facts,
whether
or
not
the
time
was
or
was
not
compensable,
did
give
a
two-day
examination
of
whether
or
not
the
grievance
process
itself
in
this
case
was
fair,
and
after
an
extensive
trial
said
that
it
was.
i
submit
that
that
is
the
proper
standard.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--the
parties
have
bargained
for
what
they
have,
your
honor.
they
have
agreed
in
their
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
arbitrators
will
decide
these
issues.
now,
having
made
that
agreement--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
i
believe,
that
the
arbitrator
or
the
grievance
committee
has
the
right,
if
not
the
obligation,
to
consider
what
the
law
is,
in
construing
the
contract,
the
contract
cannot
be
construed
in
a
vacuum
or
a
void,
it
has
to
take
into
consideration
what
the
law
is,
to
arrive
at
the
correct
result.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--no,
sir.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
when
you
say,
"left
open".
the
district--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--judge
was
more
explicit.
he
said
that
if
there
had
not
been
fair
representation,
that
he
would
have
gone
into--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--yes,
sir,
absolutely.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
apply
the
doctrine
that
it
has
set
forth
in
gardner-denver
to
flsa
wage
claims
which
involve
collective
bargaining
agreements.
now,
basically,
the
reasons
are
set
forth
in
the
satterwhite
decision.
i
think
that
the
satterwhite
decision
is
thorough
and
i
think
it
is
an
accurate
decision.
the
differences
between
the
two
types
of
legislation
necessarily
and
legitimately
permit
different
types
of
approaches
to
solve
the
problems
that
are
involved.
wages
and
hours
and
what
does
and
does
not
constitute
work
is
historically
the
bread
and
butter
for
arbitrators.
wage
discrimination
and
what
does
or
does
not
constitute
race
discrimination
is
not.
it
just
historically
has
not
been
an
area
that
arbitrators
have
delved
into.
race
discrimination
is
often
a
very
subtle
form
of
discrimination.
it
is
not
always
obvious.
it
takes
specialized
training
and
it's
training
that
arbitrators
just
generally
do
not
have.
additionally--
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
--do
arbitrators
have
less
training
or
expertise
than
judges
in
the
area
of
race
discrimination?
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir.
i
believe
they
do.
i
believe
that
judges
are
far
more
qualified
to
determine
questions
of
race
discrimination
than
are
arbitrators.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
yes,
sir,
but
since
title
vii
i
don't
believe
there
are
very
many.
mr.
s.
walton
maurras
again,
i
would
just
repeat
myself,
your
honor.
not
since
title
vii,
and
not
since
the
court
has
said
that
the
policy
of
the
united
states
is
such
that
arbitration
is
not
an
acceptable
method
of
solution.
and
that
must
have
evidenced
some
dissatisfaction
by
the
court
with
the
results
that
the
arbitrators
were
coming
up
with.
finally,
i
would
turn
to
my
position
that
failure
to
file
the
written
consents
under
29
u.s.c.
216(b)
is
fatal
to
this
action.
216(b)
requires
that
the
written
consents
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
or
named
parties,
be
submitted,
in
order
for
the
action
to
be
commenced.
subsection
(a)
provides
that
an
action
is
not
commenced
until
the
complaint
is
filed
and
the
written
consents
are
filed.
subsection
(b)
contemplates
a
situation
in
which
the
complaint
is
filed
but
the
written
consents
are
not,
and
it
provides
that
the
action
is
not
deemed
to
be
commenced
until
those
written
consents
are
filed.
no
written
consents
have
ever
been
filed
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
the
parties
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
the
purpose
for
the
written
consent
under
216(b)
is
for
the
party
to
opt
into
and
be
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
court.
that's
not
been
done
here.
although
this
case
started
as
a
combination
of
a
class
action
under
rule
23
and
a
collective
action
under
216(b),
the
dismissal
by
the
plaintiffs,
or
rather
by
the
court,
of
the
claims
under
rule
23
did
not
dispense
with
the
necessity
for
the
filing
of
the
written
consents.
216(b)
has
been
amended
three
times
since
it
was
adopted:
1966,
1977,
and
1974.
and
in
none
of
those
amendments
was
the
requirement
for
the
execution
and
filing
of
a
written
consent
ever
alleviated.
so
i
would
submit
to
you
that
this
action
has
not
been
properly
commenced,
and
that
the
plaintiffs
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
thank
you.
