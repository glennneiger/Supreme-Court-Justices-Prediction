unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say
there
was
no
other
remedy
available?
unknown
speaker
but
no
allegation
that
it
violated
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
but
that
isn't
what
this
case
is
about?
unknown
speaker
then
you
necessarily
mean
that
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
is
bargaining
away
those
rights?
unknown
speaker
and
your
contention
would
be
not
that
the
arbitrator
had
applied
an
improper
reading
of
the
contract
but
that
even
if
the
contract
had
expressly
said
that
this
is
the
wages
we
will
be
paid
and
we
will
not
be
paid
for
the
time
you
claim,
the
federal
law
simply
prohibits
that
kind
of
contract?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
a
case
was
gardner-denver?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
this
is
not
a
title
vii
case,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
held,
haven't
we,
in
a
recent
case
that
a
collective
bargaining
contract
could
override
the
norris-la
guardia
act?
unknown
speaker
in
boyd's
market
and
buffalo
forge
and
that
line
of
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
norris-la
guardia
act,
there
were
stringent
restrictions
placed
on
injunction.
injunctions
run
against
individuals
as
well
as
unions,
and
yet
in
some
of
our
later
cases
we
said
that
those
stringent
restrictions
could
be
altered
by
the
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
that,
i
have
a
little
problem.
when
this
contract
was
entered
into,
it
was
understood
one
way
or
the
other
that
this
statute
was
here.
and
if
you
had
meant
not
to
nullify
the
statute,
you
could
have
said
so
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
or
you
could
have
said
that
you
did,
one
way
or
the
other.
that
could
have
been
put
in
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
that
at
the
time
they
ought
to
be
getting
to
start
to
get
ready
to
being
precise?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
help
everything
if
we
could
be
precise?
unknown
speaker
at
least
we
would
have
been
saved
one
case,
wouldn't
we?
unknown
speaker
that
is
progress.
unknown
speaker
mr.
vladeck,
do
you
think
this
case
from
your
point
of
view
is
a
harder
one
than
gardner-denver?
after
all,
it
does
affect
laches;
gardner-denver
didn't.
unknown
speaker
yet,
our
treatment
of
the
prohibitions
against
discrimination
in
age
has
been
kind
of
a
mixture,
has
it
not,
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
mechanisms
and
the
title
vii
mechanisms,
the
title
vi
mechanisms?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
if
you
prevail
here,
that
it
will
open
the
gates
to
a
flood
of
wage
claims
in
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
an
imperial
arbitrator
at
the
end
of
the
line,
very
likely
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
going
to
be
taken
into
account,
i
would
suppose.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
taken
into
account
here,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
impartial
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
a
joint
board?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
there
was
some
litigation
maybe
a
decade
ago
about
tax
exempt
foundations
and
i
think
the
internal
revenue
service
took
the
position
that
tax
contributions
were
not
deductible
if
the
school
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
would
you
say
that
the
same
principle
ought
to
be
applied
by
the
internal
revenue
service
if
a
school
failed
to
pay
minimum
wages?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
one
that's
accorded
anywhere,
so
far
as
i
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
you
lost,
the
united
states
wouldn't
be
barred
from
suit,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
mind
taking
the
case,
though,
for
the
united
states,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
court
held
that
that
was
correct,
what
would
you
think
about
it?
unknown
speaker
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
hesitation
in
bringing
the
suit,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
you
said
there
was
a
suit;
if
you
were
representing
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the...
would
the
united
states
be
entitled
to
bring
a
suit
to
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
declared
illegal
if
it's
been
consistently
construed
by
the
parties
who
made
it
not
to
take
account
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
and,
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
needn't
confine
their
suit
each
time
just
to
recovering
the
wages
for
an
individual
employee?
unknown
speaker
what
if,
mr.
vladeck,
you
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
set
out
various
rates
of
pay
and
hours
and
working
conditions
and
then
said,
nothing
herein
contained
shall
be
understood
to
require
any
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
there
was
a
grievance
under
that
contract,
and
the
arbitrator
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
rejected
the
grievance,
although
the
grievance
was
brought
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself.
then
later,
if
that
employee
brought
a
lawsuit
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
what
if
any
preclusive
effect
should
the
prior
arbitration
have?
unknown
speaker
it
was
left
open,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
answer
the
court
gave.
i'd
say,
it
left
the
question
open.
unknown
speaker
but
it
suggested
that
a
trial
court
might
in
such
a
lawsuit
give
preclusive
controlling
effect
to
the
prior
arbitration,
didn't
it?
might,
might.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event
it
wouldn't
be
res
judicata,
it
would
be
something
less
than
that?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
a
proposal
somewhere
along
the
line
in
the
debate
of
this
pending
bill
to
make
the
fair
labor
standards
act
applicable
only
to
unorganized
workers,
and
wasn't
that
proposal
rejected?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
as
to
osha
rights,
if
the
parties
agree
to
those?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
equal
pay
act?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
parties
agreed
that
the
subject
of
equal
pay
should
be
subject
to
arbitration,
and
that
the
statute
should
not
apply.
would
that
override
the
provisions
of
the
equal
pay
act?
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provided
for
wages
lower
than
the
minimum
wage?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
grievance
was
processed
and
it
was
turned
down?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
this
joint
board
take
the
fair
labor
standards
act
into
consideration?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
didn't?
suppose
this
joint
board
didn't?
suppose
it
was
presented
to
the
joint
board,
and
the
joint
board
said--
unknown
speaker
--awfully
sorry,
but
we
just
don't
take
that
into
account.
we
go
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
and
the
employee
could
go
into
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
presented
a
claim
for
the
minimum
wage
under
the
statute
and
it
was
turned
down,
you
say
he
could
go
into
court?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
on
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
all
of
this
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
fls,
fair
labor
standards
act
claim?
unknown
speaker
which
as
i
understand
it
are
not
before
us,
are
they?
or
do
i
misapprehend
what's
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
they
were
not.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
merits
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
claim.
and
is
there
some
question
that
they
may
be
before
us?
you
don't
know
whether
they
are
or
not.
unknown
speaker
is
that
for
us
to
decide?
is
that
an
issue
in
this
case
here?
well,
you're
saying
it's
not.
or
don't
you
know?
you're
saying
it's
an
issue
though
that
an
arbitrator
can
decide.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
it's
an
issue
an
arbitrator
can
finally
decide?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
employee
filed
a
claim
and
said,
filed
a
grievance
and
said,
i
worked
12
hours
on
june
1
and
i
was
only
paid
for
eight,
and
i
am
entitled
to
some
over-time.
and
the
employer
said,
you
didn't
work
at
all
beyond
eight
hours;
you
just
didn't,
you're
a
liar,
you're
lying.
and
it
went
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
decided
he
only
worked
eight
hours.
your
suggestion
is
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
that
he
shouldn't
be
able
to
relitigate
that
fact
in
a
court?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
if
the
arbitrator
had
said,
well,
i
guess
you
did
work
ten
hours,
but
the
contract
just
calls
for
you
to
be
paid
for
eight,
then
you'd
say
the
arbitrator
would
be
in
trouble?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
your
argument
goes
only
so
far
as
to
say
that
when
there
is
a
decision
on
the
facts
that
that's
what's
binding?
unknown
speaker
mr.
maurras,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
what
do
you
contend
the
arbitrator
decided
as
to
whether
it
was
fact
or
law,
as
to
whether
the
time
where
they
were
waiting
around
was...
he
decided
it
was
not
compensable
time
under
the
contract.
did
he
decide
it
was
not
compensable
time
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
dispute
about
what
the
facts
were?
unknown
speaker
there
wasn't
any
dispute
about
the
facts,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
how
you're
saying
that
he
decided
a
fact
issue
that's
now
binding
and
precludes
his
litigating
the
statutory
issue.
unknown
speaker
the
decision
has
been
made
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
acts
don't
entitle
you
to
pay
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
that
determination
is
like
the
arbitrator
saying,
you
didn't
work
12
hours,
you
just
worked
eight.
it
just
isn't
work.
unknown
speaker
but
not
if
they're
different
standards?
not
if
the
contractual
standard
for
pay
is
different
from
the
statutory
standard?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
very
issue
he
wants
to
litigate?
i
mean,
maybe
you're
right.
you
make
a
very
persuasive
argument
that
you
are,
but
as
justice
stewart
suggested,
doesn't
that
all
go
to
the
merits
of
your
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
301
claim,
primarily,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
the
board
finding,
or
an
arbitrator,
as
the
case
may
be,
a
finding:
the
activities
he
said
he
carried
out
he
did
not
carry
out,
therefore
he
performed
no
work;
and
a
finding:
yes,
he
carried
these
things
on,
but
those
things
do
not
constitute
work?
isn't
there
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
as
to
the
former,
that
he
never
did
these
things
at
all,
i
can
understand
why
you
could
say,
if
you
let
that
go
to
arbitration,
you
ought
to
be
bound
by
it.
but
as
to
the
latter,
yes,
he
did
these
things,
but
it
didn't
constitute
work,
why
doesn't
that
still
leave
open
a
statutory
claim?
the
arbitrator
says
it
didn't
constitute
work
but
maybe
under
the
statute
a
court
might
say,
yes,
indeed,
they
did.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
difficulty,
as
i
see
it.
it
is
that
if
the
arbitrator
decides
that,
yes,
he
did
these
things
but
they
don't
constitute
work,
then
necessarily
he's
in
the
area
of
whether
the
statute
covers
what
in
fact
the
arbitrator
found
he
did.
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall,
the
district
judge
expressly
left
open
the
idea
that
if
there
had
been
a
lack
of
fair
representation,
then
the
grievance
finding
would
not
be
binding.
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
disturb
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
not
harm.
unknown
speaker
you
could
attack,
you
could
attack
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
have
it
less
than
judges?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
had
a
lot
of
race
discrimination
arbitrations
before
we
ever
had
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
there
may
not
be,
but
arbitrators
simply
had
to
decide
race
discrimination
claims
under
collective
bargaining
agreements
before
title
vii,
and
did.
unknown
speaker
can
you
address
that
last
point,
mr.
vladeck?
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
that
wasn't
one
of
the
questions
even
arguably
comprised
in
the
question
presented
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
well,
insofar
as
it
may
be
raised
below,
it
can
be
raised
below.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
properly
here,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
the
respondent
use
that
as
a
defense?
was
it
even
suggested
below?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
it
may
have
been,
isn't
he
entitled
in
defense
of
his
judgment
to
rely
on
the
theory?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
necessary
predicate
of
your
position,
is
it
not,
under
your
question
presented
on
page
3
of
your
petition,
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
claim
was
not
in
fact
submitted
to
or
passed
upon
by
the
grievance
committee?
