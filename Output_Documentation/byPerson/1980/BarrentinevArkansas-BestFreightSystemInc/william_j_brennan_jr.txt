justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
petitioners
are
truckdrivers
employed
by
the
respondent
trucking
company.
the
trucking
company
does
not
pay
its
drivers
for
time
spent
conducting
a
pretrip
safety
inspection
of
the
trucks
they
drive
or
for
time
spent
driving
the
trucks
that
fail
inspection
to
repair
shop
for
repairs.
the
drivers'
union
submitted
a
wage
claim
for
the
driver's
pretrip
inspection
and
transportation
time
to
a
joint
grievance
committee
for
binding
arbitration
pursuant
to
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
joint
grievance
committee
rejected
the
drivers'
claim.
the
drivers
then
individually
filed
an
action
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
the
pretrip
inspection
and
transportation
time
was
compensable
under
section
6
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
alternatively
under
section
4
of
the
portal-to-portal
act
amendments
to
that
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
drivers'
voluntary
submission
of
their
wage
clam
grievance
to
arbitration
barred
them
from
asserting
their
statutory
wage
claims
in
the
subsequent
court
action.
we
reversed.
we
hold
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
rights
the
drivers
seek
to
assert
are
independent
of
any
collective-bargaining
rights
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.
no
statutory
rights
devolve
on
the
drivers
as
individual
workers,
not
as
members
of
the
union
and
are
not
waivable.
while
court
should
differ
to
an
arbitral
decision
where
the
employees'
claim
is
based
on
rights
arising
out
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement,
different
considerations
apply
where
the
employees'
claim
is
based
on
rights
arising
out
of
a
statute
such
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act
designed
to
provide
minimum
substantive
guarantees
to
individual
workers
as
individual
workers.
the
chief
justice
dissents
and
joined
by
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
