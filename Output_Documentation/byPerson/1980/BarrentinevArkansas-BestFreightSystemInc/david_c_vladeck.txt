mr.
david
c.
vladeck
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
in
this
case
are
truck
drivers
employed
by
respondent,
arkansas-best
freight
system.
they
operate
out
of
abf's
little
rock,
arkansas,
terminal.
they
are
required
prior
to
embarking
on
an
over-the-road
trip
to
conduct
a
rigorous
pre-trip
safety
inspection
of
their
vehicle.
among
other
things
they
must
check
all
of
the
safety
devices,
the
brakes,
coupling
devices,
and
so
forth,
to
make
sure
they
are
in
good
working
order.
generally
it
takes
the
drivers
approximately
15
minutes
to
half
an
hour
to
conduct
this
inspection,
and
when
defects
are
found
to
take
the
vehicle
to
abf's
repair
facility,
which
is
located
at
the
terminal.
abf
refuses
to
compensate
the
drivers
for
this
time.
accordingly,
the
drivers
have
filed
a
series
of
grievances
alleging
that
abf's
refusal
violates
the
terms
of
their
contract.
these
grievances,
in
turn,
were
processed
by
the
union,
which
processed
them
through
the
joint
grievance
committee
procedures
spelled
out
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
despite
the
fact
that
the
lower
courts
have
found
that
applying
a
literal
reading
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
this
time
would
be
compensable,
the
joint
grievance
committees
rejected
the
drivers'
grievances.
accordingly,
with
no
further
remedy
left
under
the
contract,
petitioners
filed
suit
in
march,
1977,
alleging--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--under
their
contract.
petitioners...
the
grievances
had
been
pursued
through
final
stage
of
the
grievance
procedure
set
forth
in
the
contract.
accordingly,
petitioners
filed
suit
in
district
court,
alleging
among
other
things
that
abf's
refusal
to
compensate
them
for
this
time
violated
the
minimum
wage
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
an
allegation
that
it
did.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
we
have
not
pressed
that
issue
here,
your
honor.
despite
the
fact
that
defendants
have
pressed
the
fair
labor
standards
act
issue,
however,
neither
court
below
reached
the
merit
of
that
question.
rather,
both
courts
held
instead
that
the
prior
submission
of
their
contract-based
grievance
claim
to
arbitration
barred
the
right
to
have
court
review
of
their
statutory
claim
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
accordingly,
the
sole
question
presented
here
is
whether
submission
of
their
contract
claim
to
the
joint
grievance
committee
barred
subsequent
court
review
of
their
claim
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
petitioners
submit
that
the
courthouse
door
must
remain
open
to
review
the
merits
of
their
statutory
claims,
regardless
of
whether
there
has
been
a
prior
arbitrator
award
and
that
the
resolution
of
the
issue
presented
here
is
controlled
by
two
principles.
the
first
principle
that
i
will
discuss
is
that
the
decision
below
was
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
itself.
this
court
in
a
series
of
decisions
has
held
that
rights
conferred
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cannot
be
waived
or
bargained
away
as
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no,
your
honor,
what
my
contention
here
is,
is
that
this
contract
as
construed
by
the
joint
grievance
committees
violates
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
what
petitioners
want
is
the
right
to
go
into
court
to
litigate
that
question
under
the
statute.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
second
point
that
i
will
turn
to
later
on
is
that
the
decision
below
cannot
be
reconciled
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
gardner-denver
decision.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
gardner-denver
was
a
title
vii
case,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
petitioners'
position
is
that
the
standard
of
nonpreclusion
of
court
review
of
federally
granted
rights
should
govern
in
this
case,
and
as
i
will
argue
later,
the
statutes
are
parallel
in
all
material
respects
and
those
parallels
demonstrate
that
gardner-denver
should
govern
in
this
case
as
well.
but
let
me
first
turn
to
my
argument
under
the
statute.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
a
broadly
remedial
statute.
it
embodies
a
number
of
distinct
and
diverse
policy
judgments
made
by
congress.
among
other
things
the
act
sets
forth
a
strict
policy
of
guaranteed
minimum
wage
compensation
for
all
workers
covered
by
the
act.
in
addition,
it
grants
certain
workers
the
right
to
premium
pay
for
overtime
work.
to
insure
effective
enforcement
of
the
statute,
congress
has
authorized
courts
to
impose
a
variety
of
remedies,
including
double
damages,
attorneys'
fees,
injunctive
relief,
back
pay
awards
in
cases
where
the
employee
prevails.
the
role
of
these
provisions
is
dual.
congress
used
them
to
both
determine
employer
violations
and
to
insure
that
workers
who
had
been
injured
by
fair
labor
standards
act
violations
were
fully
compensated
for
their
injuries.
because
of
the
remedial
nature
of
the
statute,
this
court
has
often
recognized
that
rights
conferred
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act
can
neither
be
waived
nor
bargained
away
during
the
course
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
indeed,
this
court
has
expressly
held
that
any
customer
contract
that
falls
short
of
these
policies...
for
example,
an
agreement
to
pay
less
than
minimum
wages...
cannot
be
used
to
deprive
workers
of
their
statutory
rights.
nonetheless,
in
the
face
of
these
decisions,
the
court
below's
decision
effectively
insulates
from
judicial
scrutiny
the
contract
which
we
contend
does
precisely
that:
cuts
back
on
petitioners'
right
to
certain
minimum
wage
compensation.
under
the
lower
court's
theory,
arbitration,
which
is,
at
this
court
has
recognized,
an
extension
of
the
collective
bargaining
process,
can
be
used
to
foreclose
employees'
right
to
sue
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
petitioners
submit
that
this
result
simply
cannot
be
reconciled
with
this
court's
prior
decisions.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
we're
talking
here
about
statutory
rights
that
are
conferred
on
an
individual
worker.
these
are
not
the
majoritarian
rights
that
are
derived
from
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
our
position
is
that
where
rights
are
expressly
conferred
by
congress
and
congress
has
provided
that
the
courts
should
enforce
those
rights,
an
arbitration
decision
or
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
cannot
cut
back
on
those
statutory
rights.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
am
aware
of
no
decision
of
this
court
which
supports
the
proposition
that
an
arbitration
award
or
a
contract
can
cut
back
on
an
employee's
rights
that
have
been
both
conferred
directly
by
statute
and
are
enforceable
by
that
statute
through
the
courts.
and
that
is
this
case.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
unless
the
fair
labor
standards
act
claim
can
be
brought
into
court
after
an
arbitration
award,
then
the
act
affords
employees
nothing
more
than
they
would
derive
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
a
sense
the
lower
court
decision
renders
the
fair
labor
standards
act
a
nullity
insofar
as
it
applies
to
workers
who
are
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
under
the
statute--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--your
honor,
a
provision
could
certainly
have
been
put
in
the
contract,
but
as
this
court
has
recognized...
for
example,
in
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
labor
contracts
are
not
as
precise
perhaps
as
we
would
all
like.
they--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
point
out--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
it
would
certainly
help,
but
let
me
point
out
that
in
gardner-denver--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
but
in
gardner-denver,
the
statutory
right
was
exactly
identical
to
the
contractual
provision.
the
people
who
wrote
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
cribbed
precisely
from
title
vii.
nonetheless,
this
court
unanimously
held
that
a
prior
arbitration
decision,
even
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
were
precisely
identical
to
the
statute,
did
not
relieve
the
federal
courts
from
their
duty
to
examine
the
statutory
claim
on
the
merits.
so,
i
guess
in
a
longwinded
sense,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
even
if
the
contract
had
borrowed
precisely
from
the
language
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
courts
would
nonetheless
be
required
to
review
the
merits
of
that
decision,
to
review
the
merits
of
the
statutory
claim,
to
make
sure
that
the
rights
had
not
been
impaired.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
in
some
respects,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
an
easier
case.
why
don't
i
talk
about
that
first?
it's
an
easier
case
because
unlike
gardner-denver,
where
congress
had
set
up
an
elaborate
mechanism
of
dispute
resolution
prior
to
court
review,
elaborate
exhaustion
requirements,
deferrals
to
state
agencies,
as
this
court
elaborated
in
the
mohasco
decision
last
term.
there
is
nothing
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
bars
immediate
employee
access
to
the
courts.
now,
getting
back
to
the
thrust
of
your
question,
i
think
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
the
lower
court
ruled
against
us.
that
is,
that
they
distinguished
between
the
nature
of
employee
wage
claims
and
claims
of
discrimination.
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
the
decision
that
wage
claims
are
somehow
simpler
or
less
complex
than
claims
of
discrimination
is
inherently
a
difficult
one.
i
doubt
strongly
that
this
court
wants
to
weigh
the
relative
complexity
of
various
federal
statutes
in
deciding
how
vigorous
the
court
should
be
in
enforcing
a
congress
command.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
think
that's
correct
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
been
any
less
vigilant
in
protecting
those
rights.
all
that...
my
point
is
that...
to
begin
with,
apart
from
the
inherent
difficulty
in
measuring
the
relative
complexities
of
various
statutes,
this
court...
it
is
a
doubtful
proposition
that
this
court
wants
to
waive
the
relative
importance
of
various
remedial
statutory
schemes
passed
by
congress.
but
even
assuming
that
that's
relevant,
that
it's
a
relevant
inquiry,
here
the
long
history
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
several
of
this
court's
opinions
recognizing
its
vital
policy
underpinnings,
strongly
support
petitioners'
contention
that
it
merits
equally
vigilant
court
enforcement
as
title
vii
or
any
other
remedial
humanitarian
protection
of
statute.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
option
is
more
likely
under
the
lower
court's
theory
than
if
we
prevail.
under
the
lower
court's
theory,
as
i
read
it,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
is
without
ambiguity,
employees
would
have
the
option
of
either
first
going
into
court
or
using
the
collective
bargaining
procedure
spelled
out
in
their
contract.
if
they
opt
for
arbitration
under
the
lower
court's
theory,
they
are
barred
from
going
into
court
thereafter,
and
an
employee
who
is
faced
with
waiving
forever
his
right
to
liquidated
damages,
attorneys'
fees,
back
pay,
the
host
of
remedies
that
could
be
imposed
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
well
as
the
superior
procedural
rights
afforded
in
court
review,
may
well
opt
to
go
into
court
rather
than
to
choose
for
arbitration.
it
may
well
be
that
the
most
efficient
answer
that
this
court
can
provide
is
the
same
one
it
did
in
gardner-denver,
and
that
is
to
hold
that
regardless
of
whether
the
workers
first
employ
the
arbitration
process,
they
retain
the
right
to
go
into
court
but
preserving
the
option
of
arbitration,
which
is
relatively
cheap
and
relatively
quick.
it
may
well
be,
as
this
court
observed
in
gardner-denver,
employees
will
opt
first
to
arbitrate
their
grievances.
it
may
well
be
in
a
large
number
of
cases
that
whatever
remedies
they're
entitled
to
under
the
contract
will
be
adequate.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
in
a
large
class
of
cases
there
will
be
no
ultimate
resort
to
the
courts.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no,
your
honor,
it
was
a
panel
of
partisans.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
your
honor,
that's
not
one
of
the
remedies
that's
accorded
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
so
i--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
i
guess
my
first
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
far
afield
from
the
question
here.
and
i
guess
it's
really
a
question
that
ought
to
be
addressed
to
the
department
of
labor.
i
think
congress
has
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
evidenced
a
very
strong
concern
that
the
statutory
requisites
be
enforced.
if
that
is
an
additional
way
to
secure
enforcement
and
the
courts
have
upheld
it,
i
see
no
difficulty
with
that.
but,
again,
i
think
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct.
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--no,
your
honor,
that's
another
case
that
i
would
like
to
argue.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
my
first
question
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--no.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
no,
but
again
it's
a
question
that
i
would
not
like
this
court
to
reach.
our
principal
submission
is
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
grants
to
the
employee
a
right
to
bring
suit
in
a
court,
either
federal
court
or
state
court,
to
enforce
the
rights
conferred
upon
him
by
congress.
that's
really
all
we're
asking
for
in
this
case,
is
a
right
to
get
into
the
courthouse
door.
this
case,
at
this
stage--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that
would
not
be
the
way
the
case
would
be
characterized.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
they
could
bring
suit
on
behalf
of
the
employees.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
they
would
frame
the
remedy
in
a
different
manner.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
one
of
the
arguments
raised
by
the
court
below
in
rejecting
application
of
gardner-denver.
the
principal
reason
was,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
that
wage
claims
are
somehow
less
complex,
or
somehow
less
deserving
of
protection
by
the
courts
than
discrimination
claims.
and
i
think
the
fundamental
problem
with
that
approach
is
that
it
rests
on
a
misapprehension
of
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
arbitrable
process.
to
begin
with,
arbitrators
have
no
general
authority
to
apply
the
dictates
of
public
law.
rather,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
a
number
of
decisions
that
an
arbitration
award
will
be
only
enforced,
only
so
long
as
it
draws
its
essence
from
the
contract
between
the
parties.
moreover,
the
arbitrator
would
not
have
the
right
to
impose
the
broad
range
of
remedies
congress
thought
necessary
to
root
out
violations
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
third
reason
is
that
the
arbitration
process
is
not
necessarily
adequate
procedurally
to
protect
statutory
claims.
let
me
give
you
an
example
here,
where
we're
dealing
not
with
conventional
arbitration
but
with
a
joint
grievance
committee.
there
was
no
neutral
arbitrator.
although
there
are
many
grievances
filed,
there
is
no
written
decision.
petitioners
do
not
even
have
a
right
to
have
counsel
present
during
the
grievance
hearing.
so
there
is
no
parallel
between
the
remedies
and
procedural
safeguards
that
are
afforded
under
this
procedure
and
in
general
under
arbitration,
as
there
are
in
court
procedures.
and
lastly,
the
finality
that
is
normally
given
to
arbitration
award
rests
in
part
on
the
fact
that
arbitrators
are
simply
proctors
of
the
bargain.
they
are
simply
trying
to
derive
what
it
was
that
the
parties
privately
bargaining
for
a
contract
decided
to
agree
upon.
in
sharp
contrast,
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
congress
has
dictated
what
the
standards
are,
and
congress
did
so
to
provide
for
uniform
nationwide
standards.
there
is
no
way
that
a
patchwork
of
arbitration
decisions
can
implement
congress's
policy
embodied
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
moreover,
the
lower
court
appeared
to
presume
that
fair
labor
standards
act
rights
could
somehow
be
merged
into
the
rights
that
are
accorded
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
not
the
case.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
accords
distinct
rights;
they
do
not
form
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
at
all.
they
exist
independently
of
the
contract
and
they
were
conferred
by
congress.
to
relegate
those
rights
to
the
arbitral
forum
would
be
in
contravention
of
what
congress
spelled
out
in
the
act
itself
in
its
broad
jurisdictional
provisions.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
gardner-denver
question,
because
in
gardner--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
the
court
dropped
a
footnote,
last
page
of
the
decision,
footnote
21,
where
the
court
suggested
that
while
it
did
not
want
to
resolve
the
issue
there,
the
appropriate
course
of
action
might
be
for
the
district
court
to
assess
to
what
degree
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
language
of
the
contract
were
identical,
whether
the
procedures
that
are
normally
accorded
in
a
court
were
also
accorded
in
the
arbitration,
and
then
accord
whatever
deference
the
lower
court
felt
the
arbitration
decision
was
entitled
to.
but
the
court,
at
the
end
of
that
footnote--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--yes,
your
honor.
i
do...
but
i
think
the
court
in
part
answered
the
question
by
its
final
sentence
in
that
footnote.
it
said
that
"courts
must
remain
open
to
resolve
statutory
claims.
"
and
i
think
the
fair
import--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--well,
i
guess
i
have
trouble
with
the
word
"preclusive".
it
said
it
might
accord
it
great
weight,
which
i
think
is
very
different
from
according
it
preclusive
effect,
your
honor.
i
think
that
preclusive
effect
generally
means
that
you
always
determine
whether
the--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
see
that
i
only
have
five
minutes
remaining.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
we
address
that
at
length
in
our
reply
brief,
and
the
short
answer
is
that
we
disagree
that
consents
are
required
to
be
filed
in
noncollective
actions.
the
collective
aspects
of
this
case
were
dismissed
by
the
trial
court
early
on.
even
if
that
answer
is
not
acceptable
to
the
court,
each
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
has
signed
at
least
two
sets
of
answers
to
interrogatories,
i
believe
it's
been
deposed,
it's
been
participated
in
very
actively
in
conduct
of
this
litigation.
the
court...
the
circuit
courts
have
held
that
the
signing
of
interrogatory
answers
is
adequate
consent
requirement.
and
thus
we
don't
think
that
provides
any
basis
whatsoever
for
the
court
to
dispose
of
this
action.
moreover--
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
nor
was
it
raised
below.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
i
believe
it
was
suggested
insofar
as
the
collective
aspects
of
this
action.
however,
the
district
court
dismissed
it.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
just
like
to
respond
briefly
to
justice
stevens'
question.
whether
this
time
is
compensable
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
not
turns
on
the
question
under
the
statute
of
whether
it
is
integral
or
indispensable
to
the
primary
activity
of
the
employer.
that
phrase
has
been
the
subject
of
nearly
40
years
of
judicial
construction,
a
host
of
department
of
labor
regulations,
case
law,
and
so
forth.
it
is
a
statutory
question,
one
that
is
typically
resolved
by
the
courts.
i
do
not...
it
is
not
akin
to
the
question
that
was
put
before
the
arbitrator
in
this
case.
the
second
point
that
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
legislative
history.
congress
has
never
suggested
in
its
various
deliberations
on
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
a
contract
providing
below
the
minimum
standards
set
forth
in
the
act
could
be
used
to
cut
back
on
those
minimum
standards.
it
has
considered
the
applicability
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
many
times,
and
it's
never
yet,
never
reached
that
judgment.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
counsel
for
respondent
has
somehow
equated
the
duty
of
fair
representation
standard
with
one
about
the
correct
interpretation
of
a
contract,
and
that
standard
be
somehow
engrafted
upon
a
fair
labor
standards
act
litigation.
there
are
two
separate
standards.
congress
has
provided
distinct
statutory
rights,
rights
that
are
not
merged
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
neither
congress
nor
this
court
has
ever
even
suggested
that
a
court
must
accept
an
arbitrator's
resolution
of
a
contract
claim
as
dispositive
of
an
independent
claim
under
the
statute.
to
the
contrary,
the
decisions
of
this
court
including
the
decision
in
gardner-denver
suggested
the
opposite,
that
while
contract
rights
are
properly
relegated
to
the
arbitral
forum
the
courthouse
door
must
stay
open
to
resolve
statutory
claims.
and
i
think
this
case
bears
out
the
wisdom
of
that
policy.
because
unless
petitioners
can
get
into
court,
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
challenge
this
pay
practice
as
being
violative
of
their
rights
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
david
c.
vladeck
well,
your
honor,
we
now
argue
that
it
is
immaterial
whether
it
was
submitted
or
not.
all
that
we
were
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
in
this
case
it
was
not
submitted.
