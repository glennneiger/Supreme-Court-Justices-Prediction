well,
suppose
it
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose...
suppose
the
lady
hadn't
moved
to
minnesota
but
had
simply
sued
the
insurance
company
in
the
minnesota
courts.
same
question,
and
the
minnesota
court
didn't
dismiss
on
forum
non
conveniens
ground.
could
it
have
applied
its
own
law
or
couldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
would
be
implicated?
the
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
that
we
should
say
that
just
because
a
state
court
has
jurisdiction...
obvious
jurisdiction,
no
one
questions
it...
that
it
may
apply
its
own
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
find
the
application
of
that
rule
arbitrary
in
some
circumstances,
if
there's
acknowledged
jurisdiction,
everybody
agrees
there's
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
do
you
find
the
word
"ludicrous"
in
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
a...
what
would
allstate
be
deprived
of
if
sued
in
hawaii
on
this
cause
of
action
by
a
resident
of
minnesota?
justice
byron
r.
white
how?
how
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
it
be
deprived
of
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
please
tell
me
if
dick
does...
why,
what
deprivation
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
be
all
right
to
be
sued
there
in
hawaii
as
long
as
it
applied
wisconsin's
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
was
denied?
it
would
still
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
what
interest
has
hawaii
got
in
hearing
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am;
yes,
i
am.
yes
i
am;
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
just
dismiss
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
accident
had
happened
in
wisconsin--
justice
byron
r.
white
--had
happened
in
minnesota
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suit
was
in
wisconsin
and
the
widow
had
not
moved
to
minnesota,
she
sued...
probate
in
wisconsin
and
sued
in
wisconsin,
would
you
say
that
the
wisconsin
courts
could
apply
either
the
minnesota
law
or
wisconsin
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
always
one
answer
to
these
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
could
it...
aren't
there
some
cases
in
which
either...
the
law
of
either
state
could
be
applied
without
violating
the
constitution?
