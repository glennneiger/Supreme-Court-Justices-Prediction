was
there
ever
a
probate
in
wisconsin?
justice
blackmun
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
minnesota
probate?
justice
blackmun
perhaps
we
could
ask
your
opponent
on
this
one.
justice
blackmun
that's
why
i
asked
whether
there
was
a
wisconsin
probate.
justice
blackmun
well,
before
you
get
into
that
let
me
ask
a
question
or
two.
are
insurance
rates
of
allstate
higher
in
wisconsin
than
they
are
in
minnesota,
or
is
there
any
difference?
justice
blackmun
what
happens
when
a
policy
is
issued,
for
instance,
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
automobiles
almost
daily
cross
over
into
virginia
and
maryland?
do
they
take
into
account
experience
in
those
states
as
well
as
in
the
district,
and
are
rates
affected?
justice
blackmun
suppose
this
accident
had
taken
place
in
red
wing,
on
the
minnesota
side
of
the
eisenhower
bridge.
all
other
facts
being
the
same,
would
you
be
here?
justice
blackmun
and
the
accident
took
place
on
the,
just
barely
on
the
wisconsin
side?
by
"barely",
i
mean
within
five
miles.
justice
blackmun
did
the
policy
have
any
provision
as
to
which
law
would
apply?
justice
blackmun
that
would
have
been
an
easy
way
out
for
allstate,
wouldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
--that's
a
border
county?
justice
blackmun
that's
a
border
county?
justice
blackmun
this
brings
me
back
to
my
rate
question.
had
this
policy
been
issued
to
a
minnesota
decedent
or
a
minnesota
resident,
would
the
policy
be
any
different
than
the
one
that
was
issued
to
the
decedent?
justice
blackmun
or
the
rate
be
any
different?
justice
blackmun
well,
sometimes
policies
do
vary
from
state
to
state,
and
i...
but
i
wondered
whether
this
record
showed
anything
on
that.
i
take
it
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
show
anything
about
it.
justice
blackmun
if
it
did,
if
minnesota
rates
were
higher,
that
would
have
been
a
factor
in
your
favor
had
it
been
in
the
record.
justice
blackmun
right.
justice
blackmun
in
red
wing?
do
you
know?
justice
blackmun
she
was
a
resident
there
when
the
minnesota
probate
was
begun?
justice
blackmun
and
how
long...
does
the
record
show
how
long
she
had
been
a
resident?
justice
blackmun
is
there
any
inference
that
the
move
was
made
in
order
to
bring
a,
or
to
institute
a
minnesota
probate
and
bring
this
action?
