mr.
mark
m.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
mark
nolan.
i
represent
allstate
insurance
company
who
appears
today
as
petitioner
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
judicial
trail
that
leads
us
here
today
began
when
the
respondent,
which
is
the
representative
of
the
estate
of
mr.
ralph
hague...
it
began
when
that
representative
began
a
national--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--pardon?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
a
minnesota
representative.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
the
record
is
unclear
but
i
think
we
can
presume
that
there
was,
because
at
the
time
of
the
incident
they
resided
there
and
they
owned
a
home
there.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
think...
perhaps
i
could
answer
this--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--i
think
it's
best
to
ask
my
opponent.
i
think
it
was
to...
that
the
actual
statute
in
minnesota
is
to
appoint
a
trustee
to
bring
a
wrongful
death
action.
i
think
what
they
did
is
they
appointed
a
representative
out
of
a
probate
to
bring
the
wrongful
death
action,
or
to
do
all
things
necessary.
it's
indicated
in
their
brief,
at
any
rate,
that
this
action
is
the
main
asset
of
that
minnesota
estate,
as
indicated
on
page
11
of
their
brief.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes.
that
also
indicates
that
there
was
a
wisconsin
probate,
that
this
is
the
main
asset
of
whatever
is
in
the
minnesota
estate.
at
any
rate,
we're
here
today
because
minnesota
chose
its
law
to
say
that
the
representative
could
mr.
hague's
wisconsin
insurance
policy.
our
position
is
that
minnesota's
choosing
of
its
law
in
this
instance
is
repugnant
to
article
4,
section
1
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
constitution;
the
fourteenth
amendment
section
1,
due
process,
and
the
line
of
cases
which
have
interpreted
those
sections
as
they
apply
to
choice
of
law.
now,
in
order
that
you
know
where
i'm
going,
just
in
case
it
may
not
always
appear
clear,
let
me
give
you
a
brief
table
of
contents
as
to
how
i
intend
to
proceed
here.
i
will
go
through
the
facts
because
they're
brief
and
important.
i'll
break
out
what
contacts
go
to
each
state
quantitatively,
then
qualitatively.
i'll
discuss
those
briefly
in
terms
of
this
court's
decisions
on
choice
of
law.
and
then,
because
i
anticipate
that
by
counsel's
argument
in
that
this
court
will
have
a
larger,
an
interest
in
the
bigger
picture
of
choice
of
law,
i'll
discuss
briefly
in
restatement,
and
more
importantly,
professor
leflar's
article
because
it's
somewhat
representative
of
what
people
are
saying
in
choice
of
law
today,
and
it
seems
to
be
what
the
minnesota
court
relied
on
more
than
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
don't
know,
and
the
record
doesn't
reflect.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
minnesota
courts
seem
to
indicate
that
they
are
and
they
seem
to
make
the
admission
that
they
are.
they
did
in
the
case
of
bolgrean
v.
stich,
wherein
they
indicated
that
the
insurer
is
interested
in
the
minnesota
risk
as
opposed
to
another
state's
risk.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
think
that
watson
might
preclude
us
from
being
here:
this
court's
case,
watson
v.
employer's.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
it
was
a
bordering...
yes,
it
was
a
bordering
state.
but
i
think
that
in
conflicts
of
law,
the
state
line
is
very
important
and
must
be
honored.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
that's
right.
and
it's
especially
important
here
in
terms
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
briefly,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
on
july
1,
1974,
mr.
hague
resided
with
his
family
in
wisconsin.
he
had
traveled
for
15
years
to
work
in
minnesota
but
he
resided
in
wisconsin
with
his
family.
on
that
date
he
was
riding
as
a
passenger
on
his
son's
motorcycle
when
it
was
struck
in
the
rear
by
another
wisconsin
resident.
mr.
hague,
the
son,
and
the
person
hitting
him
were
wisconsin
residents;
the
accident
took
place
on
a
wisconsin
road.
neither
his
son,
whose
cycle
he
was
on,
nor
the
person
who
hit
him,
had
insurance.
therefore,
any
insurance
available
in
wrongful
death
action
came
from
mr.
hague's,
or
would
come
from
mr.
hague's
uninsured
motorist
coverage.
in
wisconsin
you
can
stack
that;
in
minnesota
you
cannot.
two
years
later
mrs.
hague...
two
years
later,
i
mean
in
1976,
approximately
two
years
after
this
accident,
mrs.
hague
moved
to
minnesota
and
began
this
action;
contemporaneously
with
moving
here
she
was
appointed
the
representative.
her
capacity
as
plaintiff
is
as
a
representative.
the
contacts
in
that
setting
are
these.
the
contacts
in
minnesota,
that
the
minnesota
court
felt
significant,
were,
number
one,
that
mr.
hague
had
traveled
to
minnesota
for
some
15
years
prior
to
this
accident;
that
allstate
did
business
in
the
state
of
minnesota;
that
mrs.
hague
at
the
time
she
began
this
action
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
minnesota;
and
that
now
minnesota
had
some
interest
in
the
heirs
of
this
estate.
the
contacts
with
the
state
of
wisconsin
are
that
with
regard
to
the
occurrence,
it
involved
three
wisconsin
residents,
it
took
place
on
wisconsin
roads
which
presumably
are
regulated
by
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
action
before
you
is
a
contract
declaratory
judgment
action.
this
contract
was
applied
for,
written,
and
delivered
in
the
state
of
wisconsin;
most
importantly,
written
to
conform
with
wisconsin's
law
which
had
$15,000
worth
of
minimum
coverage.
that
is
why
this
particular
type
of
coverage
was
written
and
all
the
premiums
on
this
insurance
policy
were
at
all
times
paid
from
the
state
of
wisconsin.
looking
at
those
contacts
qualitatively,
the
minnesota
contacts,
the
fact
that
minnesota
does,
or
allstate
does
business
in
the
state
of
minnesota
is
important
to
jurisdiction
but
it
does
not
give
minnesota
an
interest
as
to
what
allstate
does
with
contracts
in
wisconsin.
it's...
if
that
were
true,
you'd
be
in
somewhat
the
same
situation
as
in
savchuk
v.
rush,
where
they
tried
to
tie
some
significance
to
state
farm
being
in
all
50
states
and
justice
white
dismissed
that
as
not
being
a
significant
test
for
jurisdiction
purposes.
the
other
tests
that
mr....
or
one
other
test,
that
mr.
hague
drove
to
minnesota,
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
either
this
transaction,
in
that
the
transaction
was
written
to
comply
with
the
wisconsin
statutes
as
a
wisconsin
risk.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
occurrence
because
there's
no...
there
is
agreement
on
all
sides
that
mr.
hague
was
not
going
to
work,
coming
from
work,
having
anything
to
do
with
work
at
the
time
he
was
injured.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
that's
correct.
i
think
that
along
those
lines
i
think
that
choice
of
law
cases
have
not
had
as
much
exposure
as
jurisdiction
cases,
but
i
think
we
would
argue
that
they're
perhaps
more
important
in
that
jurisdiction
establishes
a
convenience
test,
where
you
can
hale
a
person
into
court,
where
choice
of
law
really
decides
what
is
going
to
be
the
ultimate
outcome,
the
disposition
of
matters.
it's
a
little
bit
like
saying
that
jurisdiction
may
decide
where
a
person
is
going
to
be
hung,
but
choice
of
law
would
decide
whether
he
is
going
to
be
hung.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
no
it
had
no...
no
clause
in
it.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes,
it
would.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
no.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
no.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
pierce
county,
i
believe
we're
talking
about.
in
terms
of
those...
the
cases
that--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--pardon?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
that
is
a
border
county;
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
pardon?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
you
mean,
this
case?
no.
if
i
could
perhaps
survey
the
cases,
those
cases
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
a
forum
court
cannot
apply
its
own
law,
the
ones
that
i
think
are
most
pertinent
are
dick
v.
home
insurance,
yates
v.
john
hancock,
delta
pine;
those
would
support
our
position.
in
both
of
those,
this
court
reversed
a
forum
court
that
applied
its
own
law
because
it
said
that
contacts
were
either
too
slight
or
casual;
or
that,
in
yates,
by
applying
the
georgia
jury,
letting
the
matter
go
to
the
jury,
did
not
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
new
york's
law.
those...
more
importantly,
i
should
probably
distinguish
those
cases
which,
in
which
you
have
let
the
forum
court
apply
its
own
law
over
the
contracting,
the
state
of
contracting.
the
two
that
are
the
most
prominent
are
watson
and
clay.
now,
those
are
distinguished
from
this
case.
first
of
all,
watson.
in
watson
you
allowed
direct
action
in
louisiana.
the
injury
took
place
in
louisiana
to
a
resident
of
louisiana
and
the
louisiana
court
applied
its
direct
action
statute
without
regard
to
the
policy
of
insurance
which
was
made
and
delivered
in
another
state,
which
indicated
you
could
not
do
that.
this
court
said
that
was
all
right
for
louisiana
to
do
that
and
in
so
doing
recognized
that
louisiana
had
a
significant
contact
in
interest
with
this,
with
the
matter
under
consideration
because
the
person
at
the
time
they
were
injured
was
a
resident
of
louisiana
and
the
injury
took
place
in
louisiana.
neither
of
those
things
happened
in
minnesota.
with
regard
to
clay,
clay
was...
is
perhaps
somewhat
analogous
in
that
we're
talking
about
an
ambulatory
contract
it
was
a
contract
on
personal
property.
i
think
it
was
drawn
in
illinois.
mr.
clay,
after
it
was
made
and
drawn
in
illinois,
moved
to
florida,
lived
there
for
two
years,
paid
insurance
premiums
from
there,
and
then
after
that
time
the
loss
occurred.
florida
applied
its
law
to
nullify
a
contract
provision
in
that
illinois
contract
which
would
have
limited
actions
to
a
certain
period
of
time
which
had
now
expired,
in
order
to
give
its
resident
the
right
to
recover
on
this
insurance
policy.
that
case
came
up
to
this
court
twice,
but
finally
this
court
indicated
that
because
mr.
clay
had
moved
to
wisconsin,
in
that
the
loss
took
place
in...
or
not
wisconsin,
florida;
and
the
loss
took
place
in
florida;
and
presumably
that
the
company
accepted
premiums
from
florida
for
that
two
years;
that
not
only
did
florida
have
an
interest
in
this
matter,
but
it
didn't
upset
anybody's
justified
expectations
because
the
premiums
came
and
everybody
knew
the
risk
had
moved
to
florida.
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
in
this
case
all
of
the
contacts
which
this
court
has
previously
indicated
would
lean
toward
the
choice
of
that
state's
laws
are
in
wisconsin.
with
regard
to
professor
leflar's
discussion,
i
think
perhaps
we
should
touch
upon
it
because
it
seems
this
has
become
a
favorite
of
law
review
articles
and
this
minnesota
supreme
court
certainly
gave
that
more
weight
and
credence
than
they
did
the
decisions
of
this
court.
professor
leflar
indicates
a
five-stage
test
to
deciding
choice
of
law:
predictability
of
results,
maintenance
of
governmental
order,
simplification
of
judicial
task,
governmental
interest,
and
better
rule
of
law.
now,
minnesota
somehow
applied
that
test
and
got
to
their
law.
i
think
that
if
you
really
look
at
what
professor
leflar
has
indicated,
number
one,
minnesota
did
that
without
looking
to
the
constitutional
safeguards,
and
that's
why
we're
here
today.
but
even
if
you
were
just
to
look
at
professor
leflar's
test
as
it
applies
to
the
fact
that
now
we
have
to
look
at
the
interests
of
the
states
and
we
have
a
more
fluid
society,
that
sort
of
approach,
it
still
leans
to
wisconsin.
in
other
words,
predictability
of
results,
his
first
test,
very
important
in
a
contract
dispute.
this
is
a
contract
dispute.
people
have
the
right...
this
is
very
similar
to
the
justified
expectations
test
of
the
restatement...
people
have
a
right
to
have,
unless
there
is
some
substantial
overriding
interest
of
an
opposing
state,
they
have
a
right
to
have
the
law
of
the
state
they
intended
to
have,
but
in--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--exactly.
and
not
only...
the
only
point
that
i
raise
it
today
is
because
the
minnesota
court
seems
to
say
that
there
is
some...
we
should
be
more
interest-oriented
in
interest
analysis
in
these
types
of
choice
of
law.
i
am
saying
that
even
if
they
wanted
to
take
that
approach,
they
could
apply
leflar
and
they
still
should
have
ended
up
with
wisconsin
law.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
would
the
wording
of
the
policy
be
any
different,
you
mean?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
personally
do
not
know,
but,
again,
the
minnesota
court
indicated
in
their
opinion,
they
seem
to
concede
that
it
would.
in
other
words,
i
think
on
page
49
of
their
decision,
they
indicate
that
wisconsin
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
keeping
insurance
premiums
low.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
no,
the
record
was
submitted
on
stipulated
facts
and
it
did
not
include
that
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
not
ask
for
that,
but
they...
i
think
the
law
of
the
case
would
presume
that
they
felt
it
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
frankly
do
not
know.
to
the
extent
that
it
could
be
shown
that
more
accidents
occur
because
of
that
and
if
it
could
be
shown
that
states
do
write
to
the
total
risk
of
that
state...
in
other
words,
how
many
claims
are
brought,
it
would.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes,
i
think...
yes.
i
think
they
could,
your
honor,
and
i
think
in
the
same
respect
in
justice
blackmun's
case
they
could
also
take
judicial
notice
that
it
would
likely
make
the
premium
higher
in
the
state
of
minnesota
if
minnesota
has
a
policy
which
in
essence
gives
out
more
benefits
on
the
same
insurance
contract
language.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
right.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
three
policies
here.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
but...
well,
it's--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--they
don't
quite
phrase
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
minnesota...
take
the...
in
both
contracts,
i
think
it's
safe
to
say,
whether
it
was
written
in
minnesota,
it
would
merely
say
that
under
this
coverage
you
have
uninsured
motorist
coverage
of
x
amount,
$15,000
in
this
case,
on
one
vehicle.
it
was
three
coverages.
not
three
coverages
on
one
person,
it
was
three
coverages--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--on
three
separate
vehicles.
and
wisconsin
would
say,
you
may
take
the
coverage
from
one
vehicle
and
apply
it.
minnesota
would
say,
you
may
take
the
coverage
from
all
three
vehicles
for
which
you've
paid
a
premium
and
stack
it
so
as
to--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--that's
right.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
that's
right.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
believe
they
do.
there
is...
my
only
hesitation
is
that
at
various
times
in
the
middle
'70s
there
was
differences,
i
think,
between
the
two
states
as
to
whether
you
had
to
offer
it
as
opposed
to
whether
you
had
to
get
a
rejection
of
it,
of
the
option.
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
distinction
between
the
two
states
in
that
regard.
but
in--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--i
don't
know
with
regard
to
that,
to
the
part
of
whether
in
wisconsin
and
minnesota
at
the
same
time
the
law
was
that
you
had
to
reject
uninsured
motorist
or
you
got
it
as
opposed
to
just
having
to
make
it
available.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes,
it
would.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
it
would
be
a
matter
of
record.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
no,
he
was
not,
and
both
the
vehicles
involved
were
uninsured.
the...
his
son's
vehicle,
the
motorcycle,
his
son
had
other
policies,
but
they
didn't
cover
this
vehicle.
yes,
the
insurance
that
they're
looking
to
is
outside
of
the
vehicles
involved
in
this
accident.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
the
last
area...
or
excuse
me,
i
guess
i
wandered
from
professor
leflar.
at
any
rate,
minnesota
somehow
got
to
applying
professor
leflar
instead
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
but
even
professor
leflar
is
really
a
contacts
test.
his
two
most
important
tests,
maintenance
of
interstate
order
in
governmental
interest,
are
at
the
heart
of
the
contacts
tests.
in
other
words
in
terms
of
maintenance
of
interstate
order,
if
minnesota
is
to
apply
their
law
on
the
fragile
contacts
that
they
have
with
this
case,
then,
in
essence,
they
are
chipping
away
at
the
sovereignty
of
wisconsin
to
make
laws
and
to
judicially
interpret
those
laws.
they're
giving
it
no
credence,
they're
not
respecting
that
sovereignty.
with
regard
to
his
test
of
governmental
interest,
you
don't
have
significant
governmental
interest
if
you
don't
have
contacts
with
the
matter,
significant
contacts,
with
either
the
transaction
or
the
occurrence.
minnesota
in
this
case
seized
upon
two
very
dangerous
contacts
to
deem
them
significant.
by
that
i
mean
that
two
of
the
four
that
they
even
talked
about
as
being
contacts,
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
action
was
commenced
and
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
action
was
commenced
they
were
now
concerned
with
the
heirs
of
this
estate,
are
dangerous
contacts
in
choice
of
law
decisions
because
those
are
the
type
of
contacts
which
may
be
developed
voluntarily,
willfully,
after
the
occurrence
giving
rise
to
the
dispute.
in
other
words,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
rule
that's
going
to
be
predictable,
and
to
not
promote
forum
shopping,
you
really
have
to...
perhaps
the
case
will
arise
where
you
cannot
disregard
an
after-acquired
contact,
but
you
have
to
look
very
closely
at
those,
and
in
most
instances
just
freeze
the
facts
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
or
the
time
of
the
transaction,
because
if
you
can
deem
significant
a
contact
like
mrs.
hague
moving
to
minnesota,
and
especially
in
this,
a
representative-type
action,
then
let's
say
in
this
case
mrs.
hague
didn't
even
move
to
minnesota.
they
just
picked
a
minnesota
contact.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
no,
i
think
there's
an
abundance
of
them.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
there
are
no
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
if
i
might
respond
and
rebut
quickly
and
briefly,
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
white's
question
by
pointing
out
the
ludicrousness
of
it.
allstate
could
be
sued
in
all
50
states,
all
50
states,
for
the
purposes
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
an
action
directly
against
the
insurance
company.
you
could
sue
allstate
in
all
50
states.
you
would
not
want
any
of
those
50
states
to
be
able
to
choose
their
law.
i
would
say,
in
answer
to
your
question,
no.
the
courts
cannot
choose
their
law.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
that
is
so.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
where
i
find--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--allstate
would
be
deprived
of
due
process
and
in
this
particular
instance
wisconsin
would--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--be
deprived
of
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
because
there
are
no
contacts--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--there
are
no
contacts
with
the
state
of
hawaii
that
gives
them
any
interest
over
the
state
of,
over
allstate's
interest
in
writing
this
contract
in
conformity
with
wisconsin's
law.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
think
they
could.
i
think
somebody
might
raise
a
motion
of
forum
non
conveniens.
but
you--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--then
i
think
the
result
should
be
that
they
could
hear
the
case
but
they
should
apply
wisconsin's
law.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
don't
think
they
have
any
interest
and
i
would
wonder
why
they
would
do
it.
but
they
could...
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you're
telling
me
to
assume
that
the
jurisdiction
is
okay?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
what
should
be
the
choice
of
law?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
okay.
i
don't
think
they
have
any
interest
in
it
and
that's
why
i
think
they
should
choose
wisconsin's
law.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
well,
the...
what
they
really...
you've
told
me...
i
said
that
i
would
bring
the
motion
for
forum
non
conveniens.
they
should
dismiss
the
case.
then
you've
said,
assume
that's
denied.
well,
assuming
it's
denied,
then
they
should
apply
wisconsin
law.
briefly,
they
also...
my
opponent's
missed
the
case
of
yates
versus
john
hancock
insurance.
that
is
a
case
very
much
in
point
with
this
situation
in
that
that's
a
life
insurance
policy
which
was
applied
for
in
new
york.
after
the
death
of
the
husband
the
wife
moved
to
georgia.
georgia
applied
their
law
as
opposed
to
new
york's
law
and
in
that
court
this
case
indicated
the
choice
of
law
was
a
full
faith
and
credit
issue
in
addition
to
due
process,
and
additionally
indicated
that
that
after-acquired
fact
of
her
moving
to
georgia
was
not
enough
contact
with
georgia
to
give
them
any
interest
to
apply
their
law.
the
same
is
true
of
mrs.
hague
moving
to
minnesota
after
this
instance.
full
faith
and
credit
does
go
to
not
only
acts
but
to
judicial
proceedings.
what
has
happened
here,
there's
the
judicial
proceeding
of
wisconsin
has
said,
no
stacking;
nelson
is
the
case.
no
stacking;
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
that,
you
must
apply
wisconsin's
law.
additionally,
there's
been
a
hint
that
there's
no
conflict
at
issue,
both
in
the
argument
and
in
the
brief.
there
definitely
is
a
conflict
of
law.
the
minnesota
court's
recognized
that
the
nelson
case
in
wisconsin
said,
no
stacking.
it
wasn't
raised
in
argument
but
it
is
raised
in
their
brief
that
an
amendment
was
added
to
the
statute
after
that
decision.
that
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
giving
arguments
to
stacking,
as...
without
getting
off
on
a
tangent,
it
provides
arguments
for
not
allowing
a
set
off
for
med.
pay
and
uninsured
motorist
coverage.
as
the
minnesota
court
recognized,
that
amendment
did
not
change
the
statute.
there
is
a
conflict.
the
last
issue
that
i
should
address
is,
this
court
should
hear
these
cases,
should
make
a
determination
in
these
cases.
its
position
should
not
be
hands
off.
it
should
not
abdicate
its
role
as
the
protector
of
the
constitution
in
letting
courts
just
experiment
and
go
to
this
better
rule
of
law
test
without
paying
attention
to
the
constitution.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
it
did.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes?
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
closer
case.
i
think
wisconsin--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--no,
there
isn't;
that's--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--yes.
and
in
that...
if
that
were
true
then,
if
you
got
to
that
threshold,
then
better
rule
of
law
might
be
a
way
of
resolving
that,
that
dilemma.
but
if
you
don't
get
to
that
threshold,
if
you
don't
cross
the
constitutional
area,
you
surely
don't.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
to
the
extent
that...
you're
saying...
i
guess,
if
it
would--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--yes.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
what
would
you...
you
mean,
what
would
you
turn
to
as
the--
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
--i
guess
you
would
turn
to
due
process;
the
contacts,
whether
the
contacts
were
such.
mr.
mark
m.
nolan
yes.
i
think
that
both
due
process
and
full
faith
and
credit
is
involved.
