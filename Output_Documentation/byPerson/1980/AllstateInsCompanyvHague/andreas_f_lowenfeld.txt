mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
open
by
answering
the
question
put
by
justice
blackmun
about
probate
and
the
relations
of
the
parties.
there
was
probate
in
wisconsin.
it
happened
the
decedent
did
own
a
vacant
parcel
of
land
there.
there
was
a
joint
tenancy
homestead
which
passed
outside
of
probate.
in
minnesota,
there
were
a
variety
of
interests
at
the
time.
the
decedent
worked
in
minnesota.
he
had
a
profit-sharing
retirement
plan,
he
had
some
trust
benefits,
some
medical
benefits,
he
had
some
accrued
compensation
payroll
where
he
had
worked
that
wasn't
due
yet,
and
he
had
life
insurance
proceeds.
as
you
undoubtedly
know
better
than
i
do,
justice
blackmun,
the
place
where
the
accident
happened
near
where
they
lived,
hager
city,
is
a
very
small
place.
red
wing,
which
is
where
he
worked,
is
the
larger
place.
it's
where...
one
would
go
shopping,
and
so
on.
in
fact,
when
he
was
lying
on
the
ground,
the
ambulance
came
and
brought
him
to
red
wing
to
the
hospital
there.
if,
for
example,
he
had
not
been
dead
on
arrival
and
there
had
been,
let's
say,
two
or
three
weeks
of
medical
care,
intensive
care,
that
kind
of
thing,
obviously
one
would
have
thought
that
minnesota
has
an
interest
in
recovering
that
kind
of
thing.
that's
one
of
the
dangers,
i
think,
in
the
notion
that
at
the
moment
of
impact
of
the
car
and
the
motorcycle
you
freeze
all
events.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
well,
i'm
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
in
a
constitutional
sense
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
the
interest
of
the
two
states.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
think
not
necessarily,
if
it
turns
out
that--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--i'm
sorry
to
say
i'm
not
as
prepared
on
the
geography
of
wisconsin
as
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
but
i
think
what
we're
focusing
on
what
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
focused
on,
was
its
own
interests.
now,
what
were
its
interests?
its
interests
were
primarily
that
the
typical
interest
in
compensation
law...
that
is
to
say,
compensation
for
injured
parties
and
in
the
case
of
death,
compensation
for
the
survivors,
in
this
case
the
widow
who,
as
is
perfectly
natural,
after
the
death
of
her
husband,
she
moved
in
with
one
of
her
sons.
it
wasn't
a
very
long
move,
as
it
happened,
but
the
son
lived
in
minnesota.
subsequently
she
remarried,
also
in
minnesota.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
think
the
son
was
in
red
wing.
she
subsequently
married
a
man
who
lived
in
savage.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
that's
correct.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
think
since
very
soon
after
the
accident.
she
moved
within
a
couple
of
weeks,
which
was
'74,
it
was
july,
'74,
was
the
accident.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
none
whatever.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
say
that,
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
saying
the
case
would
have
been
different
if
she
hadn't
made
a
bona
fide
move
to
minnesota
before
she
brought
suit.
the
issue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
so
close
to
the
boundary
line
is,
i
think,
important
in
the
context
of
the
expectation.
that
is
to
say,
the
insurance
company
knew
that
the
decedent
drove
every
day
for
15
years
from
his
home,
drove
across
the
river
to
work.
and
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
found,
a
substantial
portion
of
the
risk
was
in
minnesota.
this
was
a
global
policy.
it
was
in
that
case
different,
for
example,
from
the
home
insurance
against
dick,
which
is
the
principal
case
relied
on
by
my
opponent,
in
which
the
policy
was
limited
to
two
particular
rivers
near
tampico.
and
if
the
boat
was
going
to
go
anywhere
else,
even
in
mexico,
it
had
to
have
special
permission
and
a
special
endorsement
for
an
additional
premium
from
the
insurance
company.
that
wasn't
this
case
at
all.
now,
i
think
that's...
before
i
go
on
to--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--i
believe
she
could
have;
yes.
she
could
have
sued
in
either
place.
there's
no
question
that
allstate
does
business
in
all
50
states;
indeed,
that's
in
their
very
name,
and
in
all
their
commercials.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so
in
terms
of
the
rules
of
forum
non
conveniens.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
transitory
cause
of
action.
you
might
get
judicial
jurisdiction,
but
undoubtedly
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
forum
non
conveniens
would
have
been
granted
in
that
sense.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
oh,
i
suppose
in
that
case
suit
could
have...
if
we
still
believe
in
transitory
actions,
i
suppose
suit
could
have
been
brought
in
hawaii.
i
think
if
the
hawaii
court...
that
that
then
would
apply
its
own
laws.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
think
the
case
for
application
in
those
circumstances
would
be
very
close
to
arbitrary
action.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
and
at--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--yes.
i
think...
and
i
think,
to
anticipate
a
little
bit,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
later.
but
the
answer
to
justice
white's
questions,
and
in
a
sense
also
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
does
one
draw
lines?
yes,
one
draws
lines
but
if
you
consider
that
that
only
mandate
that
this
court
has,
only
mandate
since
erie
against
tompkins
and
klaxon,
that
is
to
say,
you
no
longer
can
say,
we'll
decide
what's
the
better
view;
we'll
decide
whether
professor
leflar,
professor
currie,
or
some
other
professor
has
the
best
view.
that's
not
within
the
scope
of
this
court's
decision.
the
only
one
that
really
makes
sense
now
is
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
what
does
that
safeguard?
it
safeguards
individuals,
including
insurance
companies,
but
it
safeguards
them
from
arbitrary
governmental
action.
and
what's
arbitrary
in
this
field?
there's
no
kind
of
procedural
due
process,
no
question
that
there
was
service
of
process
and
notice
and
all
of
that.
they've
a
right
to
be
allowed
to
be
heard.
a
kind
of
substantive
due
process
may
come
in
when
a
state
applies
a
law
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it:
if
minnesota
applied
the
law
of
hawaii,
or
if,
for
example,
minnesota
said,
we
are
interested
in
this
case
simply
because
it's
in
our
court,
although
we
never
heard
of
this
lady.
she
doesn't
live
here,
she
just
found--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--i
think
that
is
essentially
our
position.
it's
true
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
is
occasionally
brought
in.
i
think
the
workmen's
compensation
type
of
cases,
alaska
packers
and
pacific
employer's,
especially,
have
put
that
to
rest;
clay
as
well,
and
in
a
sense,
as
a
kind
of
a
fortiori
case,
your
most
recent
decision
last
june
in
thomas
against
washington
gas
light.
i
think,
realistically
speaking,
justice
brennan,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
doesn't
have
any
place
here,
remembering
that
there
is
no
act,
there's
no
statute
of
wisconsin
that's
relevant
to
this
case.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
if
i
could
make
a
somewhat
roundabout
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
i
think
it's
worth
putting
this
whole
question
of
uninsured
motorist
insurance
in
context
a
little
bit.
just
let
me
back
up
for
a
moment.
it
starts
out
in
about
the
mid-60s.
in
many
states
there
is
a
drive
for
compulsory
insurance
and
the
insurance
industry
resists.
in
other
states
there's
a
drive
for
no-fault
insurance,
and
the
insurance
industry
resists.
and
what
they
say,
they
recognized
the
problem
of
the
uncompensated
traffic
victim
and
they
say,
here's
what
we'll
do:
we'll
offer
a
policy,
and
then
later
some
states
required
it,
but
we'll
offer
a
policy
that
says
the
motor
vehicle
owner
and
members
of
his
household,
as
defined
in
one
of
those
small
print
clauses,
but
basically
that's
right...
will
be
covered
for
accidents
arising
where
the
fault
is
that
of
the
uninsured
motorist.
in
other
words,
it's
a
kind
of
hybrid.
it's
first-party
coverage
but
it's
tort;
it's
negligence,
it's
not
a
non-fault
coverage.
well,
now,
what
happens
is,
it
works
both
ways.
you
are
covered,
yourself,
and
your
members
of
your
family,
wherever
you
may
be,
in...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
your
own
car,
and
also
occupants
of
your
car
are
covered.
so
it
happens
all
the
time
that,
let's
say,
mr.
a
has
insurance,
including
this
insurance.
he
then
is
driving
as
a
passenger
in
mr.
b's
car
when
x,
the
uninsured
motorist,
negligently
runs
into
them.
so
a
is
covered
under
his
own
policy,
for
which
he's
paid
a
premium,
and
he's
covered
as
an
occupant
under
b's
policy.
now,
then
the
question
is,
what
does
the
coverage
say?
the
insurance
companies
try
to
make
so-called
other
insurance
clauses.
and
there
is
a
standard
clause
put
out
by
the
national
insurance
bureau,
which
was
followed
in
this
policy
and
seems
to
be
in
all
the
textbooks
and
in
nearly
all
the
policies.
it
didn't
quite
say
there
shall
never
be
stacking.
apparently,
if
they'd
said
that,
the
insurance
commissioners'
wouldn't
have
permitted
it.
but
what
they
tried
to
do
is
to
say,
if
there
are
two
policies,
one
of
them
is
excess
to
the
other
and
you
don't
get
more
than
the
total
limit.
now,
then,
the
stacking
cases
came
up
and
i
was
astounded...
if
you
look
at
professor
widiss's
book
on
uninsured
motorist
insurance,
which
came
out
in
1969...
there's
a
1980
supplement...
it's
about
400
pages
of
mostly
cases.
all
this
has
come
up
in
the
last
few
years.
interestingly
enough,
about
a
third
of
the
cases
seem
to
involve
allstate.
so
they're
very
fully
aware
of
this.
there's
no
unexpected
there.
and
the
majority
of
states
so
far...
it's
a
little
hard
to
have
an
exact
rule,
because
not
all
of
the
cases
involve
the
highest
court
of
the
state...
and
there
are
different
kinds
of
stacking.
there's
the
guy
in
the
other
fellow's
car,
and
there's
also
the
fellow
who
has
more
than
one
policy,
or
more
than
one
car
on
the
policy.
the
majority
of
states
that
have
faced
this
problem
have
said,
we
will
permit
recovery
on
each
policy
since,
after
all,
a
premium
has
been
paid
on
each
policy.
and
there's
no
windfall,
since
there
is
actual...
it
only
goes
up
to
the
provable
damages.
it's
not
like
having
two
policies
on
a
boat
that
sinks
and
you
could
recover
$4,000
on
a
$2,000
boat.
that's
not
this
at
all.
this
is
recovery
for
accidental
injury
or
death
up
to
your
provable
damages.
in
our
case
we
had
a
52-year-old
man
who
was
earning
about
$15,000
and
had
children,
so
there's
no
issue
here,
that
he's
being
somehow
given
a
windfall.
now,
if
i
may
get
back...
a
somewhat
longwinded
answer
to
your
question...
if
they
had
absolutely
said,
no
stacking,
i
think
the
wisconsin
insurance
commissioner
would
probably
have
said,
no.
probably
the
minnesota
insurance
commissioner
would
have
said
no.
they--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--well,
it's
kind
of
interesting,
if
you
look
at
the
policy.
for
instance,
the...
wisconsin,
as
we
know,
has
direct
action
statutes.
and
so
the
policy
here...
which
is
why
i
think,
in
fact...
to
come
back
to
justice
blackmun...
the
rate's
probably
higher
in
wisconsin
rather
than
lower.
and
the
policy
says
no
one
can
sue
the
insurance
company
except
for
injuries
in
wisconsin.
now,
you
know
that's
not
going
to
stand
up.
if
a
wisconsin
driver
comes--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--well,
it's
possible.
courts
all
around
the
country,
and
minnesota
is
a
good
example,
have
found
ways
around
a
variety
of
these
clauses.
sometimes
they
say
they're
ambiguous.
if
it
were
unambiguous,
as
you
suggest,
justice
stevens,
they
might
say
it's
against
public
policy.
i'm
not
certain.
but
certainly
it
would
be
a
stronger
case
for
allstate
than
this
one.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
that's
right.
but
if
you
notice,
several
things
are
very
different
about
home
insurance
and
this
case.
perhaps
the
most
important
one
for
our
present
purposes
is,
that
under
the
present
rulings
of
this
court
there
would
have
been
no
jurisdiction
in
home
insurance.
home
insurance
against
dick
is
really
the
grandfather
of
seider
and
roth,
and
rush
and
savchuk,
and
all
of
those
cases.
it
was
a
quasi-in-rem
action
brought
by
taxing
the
alleged
res,
which
was
the
obligation
to
reinsure,
of
a
new
york
company
that
was
doing
business
in
texas.
that
is
to
say,
anglo-mejicana,
which
was
the
actual
insurer
had
no
connection
whatever.
that's
one
point.
second,
there
was
a
choice
of
law
clause.
it
said,
this
policy
will
be
governed
by
the
commercial
code
of
mexico.
and
third,
as
i
already
said,
it
specifically
said,
the
following
rivers
are
the
only
ones
covered
by
this
policy.
so
those
are
the
three
differences.
and
i
guess
it
is
right,
that
if
we
had
that
again,
that
probably
still
is
arbitrary
action.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
think
it's
relevant,
but
i
don't
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is
conclusive.
because,
one,
it's
understood
that
this
is
nationwide,
in
fact,
continental-wide,
all
of
north
america,
policy.
second,
that
the
insurance
company
itself
does
business...
in
fact,
i
think
it's
the
fourth
largest
insurer
with
over
200,000
policies...
in
minnesota.
if
you
recall,
for
example,
the
quite
interesting
opinion
in
the
watson
case
by
justice
frankfurter,
in
which
he
has
a
kind
of
alternative
argument
to
the
one
used
by
justice
black.
he
says
the
insurance
company
knew
all
about
this.
it
came
into
louisiana,
it
took
advantage
of
the
privilege
of
doing
business
there,
and
it's
bound
by
the
laws.
i
think
that
same
argument
applies
to
allstate
in
this
case.
so
that
if...
in
other
words,
if
the
minnesota
supreme
court
had
then
said
in
the
present
case,
hague
against
allstate
is
different
from
van
tassel
against
horace
mann,
which
is
the
principal
case
in
which
they
in
minnesota
said,
we
apply
stacking.
it's
different
because
there
is
a
choice
of
law
clause,
because
the
anti-stacking
clauses
are
unambiguous
in
contrast
to
the
other
case...
here
they're
the
same.
if
it
had
made
all
those
points,
i
think
that
is
an
appropriate
way
for
the
minnesota
supreme
court
to
do.
if
it
had
still
said,
no,
because
what
we're
concerned
with
is
protection,
is
the
role
of
the
accident
compensation
system.
and
we
have
our
widow,
we
have
an
estate
that
we
are
concerned
with.
and
if
it
had
said
that,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
arbitrary
action
of
the
kind
that
this
court
ought
to
interfere
with.
this
court
is
not,
i
think,
a
court
of
errors
and
appeals
on
the
choice
of
law
theories.
contrary
to
what
mr.
nolan
said,
we're
not
asking
you
here
to
say,
we
agree
with
minnesota
supreme
court's
construction
of
leflar.
we're
simply
saying
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
dignity
of
the
kind
of
arbitrary
action
that
this
court
sits
to
exclude.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
well,
justice
powell,
i
think
the...
i
raised
the
issue
of
employment
because
the
minnesota
supreme
court
raised
it.
if
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
accident
compensation
system...
and
of
course,
this
is
a
hybrid
between
tort
and
contract,
as
i
already
suggested...
the
more
important
issue
is
whether
the
widow
and
heiress
becomes
a
public
charge
or
whether
there
is
a
fund
available
to
pay
for
her.
so
i
think
the
employment
though
relevant
is
less
critical
than
the
residence
of
the
lady,
provided,
and
i...
just
to
repeat
what
i
said
to
justice
rehnquist,
provided
there's
no
suggestion
of
manipulation
or
deliberate
forum
shopping,
something
like
that.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
you
mean,
if
minnesota
also
now
says
stacking
is
foolish?
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
well,
i
suppose
then
there
is
no
conflict
of
laws.
and
in
fact,
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
that
may
well
be
the
situation,
since,
interestingly
enough,
the
wisconsin
court
in
the
nelson
case,
which
said,
we
don't
have
stacking
here,
said,
that's
because
this
accident
happened
before
the
statute
was
amended
and
then
the
statute
was
amended
and
they
said,
well,
we
make
no
finding
as
to
how
that
would
come
out.
and
minnesota
supreme
court
said,
it's
possible
that
wisconsin
would
come
out
the
same
way
but
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that;
we
don't
want
to
hold
a
hearing
on
how
wisconsin
would
judge
this,
we're
just
going
to
apply
our
own
law.
now,
let
me
just
briefly,
if
i
may,
come
back
to
the
question
of
what
line
should
be
drawn.
i've
already
suggested
that
this
court
ought
to
be
reluctant
to
get
into
the
question
of
a
particular
contact
or
a
particular
interest,
whether
it's
residence
or
the
place
of
the
accident
or
the
domicile
of
the...
of
a
particular
party,
whether
it's
plaintiff
or
defendant.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
all
right.
thank
you.
0
[recess.]
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
thank
you
very
much.
as
i
was
saying
at
the
lunch
break,
the
position
that
we
take
is
that
this
court
does
not
sit
to
decide
between
one
theory
of
conflict
of
laws
and
another,
whether
it's
contacts
analysis
or
interests
analysis,
the
first
restatement,
the
second
restatement,
professor
leflar,
or
some
other
professor;
that
what
it
sits
to
oversee
is,
and
only
is,
the
question
of
arbitrary
action.
i'd
like,
perhaps,
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
remaining--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--that's
entirely
my
position,
justice
brennan;
yes.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
well,
that's
an
interesting
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
put
that
question.
of
course,
we've
had
this
series
of
cases
now...
four
of
them
in
four
years...
in
which
the
jurisdiction
has
been
challenged
and
state
court
action
has
been
struck
down.
it's
interesting
that
justice
brennan
in
each
of
those
cases
said,
why
is
that
so
if
choice
of
law
would
be
permissible?
and
the
majority
has
said,
no,
we
are
prepared
to
strike
down
certain
cases
of
arbitrary
reaching
out.
i
think
it
turns
out
that
some
of
the
cases
that
you've
had
in
the
jurisdiction
area...
rush
and
savchuk
in
particular
is
a
good
example;
perhaps
kulko
as
well...
the
court
might
have
come
down
the
other
way,
but
the
difficulty,
if
it
had
come
down...
that
is
to
say,
struck
them
down
on
choice
of
law
rather
than
on
jurisdictional
grounds...
but
if
you
had
done
that,
it
would
have
opened
up
a
very
large
area
of
fine-line
drawing,
weighing
this
against
that,
and
it
would
have
involved
this
court
telling
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma,
minnesota,
california,
et
cetera,
how
to
decide
cases.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
what
you
told
them
in
those
cases
is,
don't
decide
this
case;
it
ought
to
be
adjudicated
somewhere
else,
or
dismissed...
as
in
volkswagen...
dismiss
the
following
parties
from
the
case,
and
then
you
can
go
ahead
with
other
parties.
that's
exactly
the
difference.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
terms
of
a
vibrant
federal
system,
it's
easier
to
draw
lines
and
it's
less
intrusive
into
the
work
of
the
state
judiciary
to
say,
you
may
not
hear
this
case
at
all,
than
to
say,
you
can
hear
it
but
you'll
only
decide
it
in
a
certain
way.
i
think
that
was
started
with
hanson
against
denckla
and
then
kept
up
in
these
four
cases
that
you've
had
in
the
last
four
years
now.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
would
say...
i
would
say
federalism
and
a
certain
amount
of
experimentation.
if
you
think
about
the
difficulty
with
setting
down
rules
in
the
choice
of
law
area,
it's
a
little
bit
like
the
criminal
procedure
cases.
since
you
have
no
federal
statute,
you
only,
your
only
criterion
is
a
due
process
criterion
if
you
lay
down
a
certain
rule.
for
example,
the
issue
must
vest
at
the
date
of
impact,
or
the
following
are
minimum
contacts,
and
so
forth.
it
will
turn
out
that
neither
the
lower
federal
courts
nor
the
state
courts
nor
state
legislatures
nor
congress,
no
one
can
make
any
changes.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
for
the
development
of
federalism.
it's
no
accident,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
conflict
of
laws
has
really
been
in
the
forefront
of
experimentation
in
the
whole
area
of
accident
compensation.
that
is,
we've
had,
for
example,
the
series
of
guest
statute
cases
that
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
with,
many
in
new
york,
some
in
california
and
elsewhere.
and
the
result
over
time,
though
the
conflict
theories
have
tended
to
vary
with
the
different
professors
and
the
different
judges,
in
the
end
we've
had
a
reduction
in
guest
statutes;
we've
had
a
reduction
in
wrongful
death
limitations;
a
variety
of
these
kind
of
quirky
state
rules
have
tended
to
go.
in
other
words,
conflict
of
laws
has
been
an
engine
of
law
reform
generally
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
this
court
were
to
stop
that.
i
think
that's
what
professor
freund
meant
in
his
essay
about
chief
justice
stone,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
what
chief
judge
kaufman
meant
in
the
pearson
case
in
which
he
warned
against
returning
to
the
"ice
age"
of
conflict
of
laws.
i
think
altogether
a
dynamic
federalism,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
furthered
by
a
statement
that
the
court
will
come
in
only
at
a
certain
time,
only
when
there's
really
arbitrary
action,
not
by
an
attempt
to
draw
particular
rules
of
this
kind
here.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
should
say
that
or
not,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think--
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
--i
would
put
the
statement
slightly
differently.
i
would
say
that
if
you
exercised
the
kind
of
vigilance
that
you've
exercised
in
the
last
few
years
on
judicial
jurisdiction,
on
reaching
out
by
state
courts,
you
will
not
find
the
kind
of
arbitrary
action,
the
kind
of
parochialism...
as
the
chief
justice
suggested...
that
you
need
to
worry
about.
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
would
put...
but
if
you
did
put
it
the
way
you've
said,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
tragedy.
i
think
it's
a
slight,
subtle
difference.
mr.
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
i
think
i
could
certainly
conceive
of
situations
where,
as
applied,
that
such
a
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
yes;
for
example,
if
in
our
case
mrs.
hague
had
remained
in
wisconsin
or
had
moved
to
new
york
but
had
hired
minnesota
counsel
and
then
were
applying
that
kind
of
statute,
that
would
seem
to
me
arbitrary
action;
yes.
i
think
my
time
is
out.
thank
you.
