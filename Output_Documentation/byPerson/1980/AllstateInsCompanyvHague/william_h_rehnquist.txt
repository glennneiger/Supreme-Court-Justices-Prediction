mr.
nolan,
you
referred
to
savchuk
and
i
think
volkswagen
is
probably
along
the
same
lines.
that
really
is
the
exercise
of
judicial
jurisdiction--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--over
a
party.
what
you're
talking
about
is
the
home
insurance,
delta
pine
line
that
raises...
that
say
even
if
you
have
judicial
jurisdiction,
the
due
process
clause
or
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
limits
the
right
of
one
state
to
wholly
impose
its
laws
even
on
a
party
that
conceivably
is
before
it
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
rehnquist
minnesota
is
free
to
adopt
professor
leflar's
test
whether
we
think
it
is
a
wise
one
or
not,
unless
it
somehow
offends
the
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
your
case
might
well
be
different
if
the
decedent
had
lived
in
madison,
which
is
150
miles
from
the
minnesota
line,
and
commuted
to
minnesota
every
day
to
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
home
insurance
was
the
case
of
a
state
court
that
tried
to
find
a
way
around
a
policy
and
it
was
reversed
by
this
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
by
the
same
token,
you
could
say
we
told
them
how
to
decide
them
on
the
basis
of
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
ludicrousness,
you
mean
the
ludicrousness
of
the
result,
not
the
ludicrousness
of
the
question?
