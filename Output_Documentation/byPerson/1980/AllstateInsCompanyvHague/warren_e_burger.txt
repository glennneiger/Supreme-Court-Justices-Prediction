a
line?
chief

in
what
county

the,
would
such
an
element
as
the
age
in
which
one

some
bearing
on
rates?
that
is,
if
one
state

serious
effect
on

e.
burger
very
well
mr.

mr.
lowenfeld.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
these
distances
make
a
difference
in
applying
choice
of
law
concepts
or
do
lines,
boundaries
on
maps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
the
accident

happened
at,
up

instead
of
where
it
did,
150
miles
north?

difference?

it
on
the
other

warren
e.
burger

then
what
happens
to
your
argument
about
the
widow
becoming
a
public
charge?
chief
justice

to
a
degree...
or,
i'll

to
a
degree
put
jurisdiction
and
choice
of
law
in
logic-tight
compartments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that...
i'll
put
it
another
way...
which
do
you
think
will
be
advanced
by
the
approach
you
suggest,
hands

by
this
court?
federalism
or
parochialism?

it
parochialism?
