mr.
nolan,
a
good
many
states,
i
think,
require
uninsured
motorist
insurance--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--do
either
of
these
states
require
it
as
a
matter
of
law
for
policies
written
in
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
they
were
different?
i
think
you
are
saying
you
don't
know
whether
they
had
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wouldn't
that
appear
from
the
statutes
of
the
two
states
or
from
the
regulations
of
the
insurance
commissioners?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it'd
be
a
matter
of
record
somewhere?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
emphasized
two
factors,
primarily:
the
presence
of
the
will
in
minnesota
and
the
fact
that
the
decedent
was
employed
in
minnesota.
i
think
it
was
justice
white
who
asked
you
what
the
effect
would
have
been
if
she
had,
the
widow
had
remained
in
wisconsin.
my
question
is
whether
your
case
would
be
substantially
weakened
or
you
would
have
no
case
at
all
if
decedent
had
not
been
employed
in
minnesota?
