constitutional
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
like
to
be
sure
about
what
you
mean,
because
there's
really
no
federal
constitutional
question
for
us
to
decide
in
choice
of
law
cases,
unless
there's
some
alleged
arbitrary
action,
denial
of
due
process,
and
that's
all?

jr.

in
justice
white's
hypothetical,
would
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
be
involved?
justice
jr.
as
i
understand
your
argument
in
this
case
you
do
rely
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
cited
that
what
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
violated
that
clause--

but
in
the
case
that
mr.
justice
white
put
to
you
how
would
it
be
covered?
what
would
you
have
to
turn
to
then?
justice
jr.
in
the
federal
constitution?
justice
jr.
but
these
cases
do
differ.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
applied
minnesota
law
to
decide
that
the
$15,000
uninsured
motorist
coverage
on
each
of
her
late
husband's
three
automobiles
could
be
stacked
to
provide
total
coverage
of
$45,000
for
her
husband's
death
in
a
collision
that
occurred
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
which
state
the
respondent
and
her
husband
lived
at
that
time
and
where
the
policies
were
issued.
wisconsin
law,
this
allowed
such
stacking
and
would
have
limited
to
coverage
to
$15,000
but
the
minnesota
supreme
court
held
that
minnesota
law
and
not
wisconsin
law
provided
the
applicable
law
this
upon
the
ground
of
its
analysis
of
relevant
minnesota
contacts
and
interests
including
the
fact
that
the
decedent
commuted
daily
from
his
wisconsin
home
to
his
job
in
minnesota.
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
court.
we
hold
that
neither
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
bars
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
choice
of
substantive
minnesota
law,
in
this
case,
to
govern
the
effect
that
the
relevant
insurance
contract
provision.
two
opinions
support
that
affirmance.
one
is
filed
by
me
and
is
joined
by
justice
white,
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun.
the
other
is
filed
by
justice
stevens,
justice
powell
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
stewart
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
