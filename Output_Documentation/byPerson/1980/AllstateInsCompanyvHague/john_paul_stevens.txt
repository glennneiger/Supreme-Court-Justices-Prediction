mr.
nolan,
if
you
would
help
me
with
the
other...
i
was
thinking
about
the
contractual
aspect
of
this
for
a
moment.
could
you
help
me
with
this
concept
of
stacking
that's
kind
of
at
the
bottom
of
this,
i
must
confess
i
didn't
think
about
it
enough
before
argument.
what
that
means,
i
gather,
is
that
the
victim
who
has
a
policy,
has
an
uninsured
motorist
clause
in
it
and
has
two
policies
may
recover
on
both
policies.
is
that
the
way
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
there
was...
or
are
there
three
policies
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
that
in
wisconsin
he
could
only
recover
on
one
because
wisconsin
in
effect
as
a
matter
of
law
imposes
a
condition
in
the
contract
that
says,
even
if
you
take
out
three
or
four
more
policies
with
uninsured
motorist
clauses
in
them,
they
don't
mean
what
they
appear
to
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
i'm
just...
that's,
i'm
just
trying
to
see
what
kind
of
obligation
is
being
changed
here
by
minnesota.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
policy
should
be
construed
as
limited
to
the
vehicle
described
in
that
policy
or
without
saying
anything
pick
up
other
vehicles
and
additional
coverage,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that
you
said
the
other
way
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
uninsured
person,
or
the
person
who
had
the
policy,
wasn't
in
any
of
the
three
vehicles
on
which
he
had
the
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
case
be
any
different
if
the
insurance
policies
had
express
language
in
them
saying
that
only
the
coverage
under
one
policy
should...
one
policy
shall
provide
the
maximum
uninsured
motorist
coverage?
and
then
with...
minnesota
said
those...
we
stack
in
minnesota,
and
that's
contrary
to
our
public
policy.
would
that
be
a
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
rephrase
the
question.
say
that's
what
the
contract
said
and
wisconsin
insurance
commissioner
said,
that's
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
express
language
i'm
suggesting
is
no-stacking
express
language
that
only
one
policy
shall
afford
uninsured
motorist
coverage
even
though
there
are
three
vehicles
and
three
policies.
and
that
was
express,
and
the
parties
spelled
it
out
more
or
less
as
they
had
in
the
home
insurance
company
case
on
the
time
problem.
would
not
the
home
insurance
case
control
in
that
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lowenfeld,
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
the
issue
is
affected
at
all
by
the
clarity
and
certainty
of
the
obligation
that
was
created
in
the
other
state,
whether
it
depends
to
a
certain
extent
on
a
construe
in
that
state's
law
as
opposed
to
giving
effect
to
a
very
plainly
assumed
obligation
by
parties
who
negotiate
a
contract.
is
that
relevant
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lowenfeld,
would
you
say
that
a
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
that...
say
the
state
of
minnesota
passed
a
statute
that
said,
in
all
cases
tried
in
minnesota
courts
the
minnesota
judges
shall
apply
minnesota
law?
