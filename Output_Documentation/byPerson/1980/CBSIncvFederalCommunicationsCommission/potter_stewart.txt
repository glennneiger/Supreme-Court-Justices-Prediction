the
statute
involved
here
was
not
in
effect
in
1976,
was
it?
justice
stewart
but
it
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
the--
justice
stewart
--passed
in--
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute,
of
course,
talks
about
individual
stations--
justice
potter
stewart
--and
the
parties
in
this
case
are
networks,
not
individual
stations.
now
i...
i
think
the
networks
do
own
a
limited
number
of
individual
stations--
justice
potter
stewart
--yes,
right.
justice
stewart
but
still
with
all
this
discussion
with
my
brothers
about
the
sanctions
to
be
imposed,
the
statute
is
very
clear,
it
has
no
reference
whatsoever
to
networks,
except
insofar
as
they
may
be
the
owners
of
individual
stations,
and
i
know
they
are,
a
limited
number.
justice
stewart
by
the
statute
there
has
to
be
a
legally
qualified
candidate,
whatever
that
means.
justice
stewart
there
is
none
now,
for
1984.
justice
stewart
well
even
if
you
are
right
in
everything
you've
said
so
far,
the
duty
is
only
to
allow
reasonable
access
or
to
permit
purchase
of
reasonable
amounts
of
time,
and
somebody
has
to
decide
what
that
means.
justice
stewart
well,
but
do
they
have
discretion
to
decide
what's
reasonable?
that's
the...
not
unlimited
discretion.
justice
stewart
i
mean,
the
word
"reasonable"
must
mean
something,
doesn't
it?
it
doesn't
mean
absolute,
it
means
something
less
than
that.
justice
stewart
well
that's
the...
wasn't
that
one
of
the
issues
and
an
important
issue
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
but
after
weighing
those,
it
did
come
up
with
at
least
one
per
se
rule,
and
that
is
that
any
broadcaster's
blanket
refusal
to
sell
any
time
to
any
qualified
candidate,
even
after
the
campaign
had
begun
during
a
certain
period
was,
per
se,
unreasonable.
justice
stewart
a
broadcaster
might
say
this
is
the
christmas
season
and
we
have
our
own
programming
and
we
don't
want
to
accept
anything
until
after
the
first
of
the
year.
justice
stewart
but
there
is
no,
ever,
after
the
weighing
process
was
over
they
came
up
with
this
per
se
rule,
didn't
they?
the
commission
did.
justice
stewart
right.
and
therefore
that
no
blanket
ban
is
constantly
reasonable?
justice
stewart
well
from
what
i've
read
and
heard
here
today,
i
understand
that
the
broadcasters
welcome
this
position.
