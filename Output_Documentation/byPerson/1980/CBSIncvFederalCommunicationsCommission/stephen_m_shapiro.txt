mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
submission
in
this
case
has
two
principal
parts.
first,
we
contend
that
section
312(a)(7)
imposed
a
new
obligation
on
broadcasters
to
afford
reasonable
access
to
individual
candidates
for
federal
elective
office.
second,
we
contend
that
the
commission
properly
found
that
petitioners
failed
to
afford
reasonable
access
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i'd
like
to
take
up
each
of
these
points
in
turn.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
networks
are
the
sole
owners
and
operators
of
five
licensed
television
stations
in
the
biggest
television
markets
in
the
country.
they
are
broadcast
stations,
the
commission
has
always
viewed
them
as
such
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
and
it
continues
to
view
them
as
broadcast
stations
that
do
own
licensed
television
stations.
so--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--only
the
licenses
of
those
stations
could
be
revoked;
the
commission
has
not
yet
determined
whether
cease
and
desist
orders,
in
addition
to
revocation,
could
supplement
its
remedies
in
this
area.
that's
a
possibility
as
well.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
the
commission
hasn't
passed
on
the
available
arsenal
of
remedies,
because
it
has
not
yet
had
occasion
to
impose
sanctions
on
any
station
in
the
last
eight
years.
the
question
of
remedy
hasn't
arisen
yet.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
at
these
early
stages,
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
commission
would
conclude
that
the
presidential
campaign
for
1984
is
not
yet
in
full
swing.
it
looks
to
a
complex
of
factors;
the
nearness
of
the
primaries
and
the
conventions
and
caucuses
in
the
several
states,
the
number
of
candidates
who
have
announced
their
intention
to
seek
the
presidency,
the
existence
of
nationwide
campaign
activities
and
campaign
organizations...
it
looks
to
a
whole
series
of
such
factors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
true.
to
be
legally
qualified,
the
candidate
has
to
have,
to
be
on
the
ballot
in
ten
different
states
for
the
forthcoming
primaries
and
to
have
announced
his
intention
to
seek
the
presidency,
so
at
this
early
stage
you
wouldn't
even
have
a
legally
qualified
candidate.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
source
of
authority
in
the
commission's
view,
is
in
the
statutory
requirement
that
reasonable
access
be
afforded.
and
the
commission
interprets
the
term
"reasonable
access"
to
have
a
time
component
as
well
as
an
amount
component.
and
it
of
course
has
explicit
statutory
authority
to
prescribe
conditions
that
give
effect
to
other
provisions
in
the
statute.
we
quoted
that
provision
in
our
brief.
it
does
have
authority
to
interpret
provisions
such
as
the
reasonable
access
provision.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
believe
that
it
would
have
that
authority,
but
it
hasn't
purported
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
it
waits
for
complaints
to
be
filed
and
then
determines
if
the
campaign
is
in
full
swing,
if
it's
found
to
be
in
full
swing
it
then
considers
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
air
time
has
been
reasonable.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
true.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
right.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
statute
has
worked
remarkably
well,
even
with
respect
to
these
races
for
a
seat
in
congress.
principally
because
the
parties
negotiate,
resolve
these
questions
on
their
own;
there
have
only
been
37
rulings
under
the
statute
in
the
last
eight
years.
and
considering
the
fact
that
there
have
been
2500
races
for
federal
elective
office
in
that
period
and
there
are
almost
10,000
broadcasters
are
subject
to
this
provision...
that's
a
remarkably
small
number
of
interventions
in
the
particular
cases.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
the
cost
of
this
segment
of
time
was
$186,000
on
cbs.
there's
a
natural
pressure
not
to
make
early
requests
or
to
make
unduly
large
requests
for
time.
quite
expensive.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
our
brief
in
opposition
we
note
that
eight
of
them
have
come
afterwards
and
all
of
those
were
in
favor
of
the
broadcaster,
save
one,
the
rest
of
them
preceded
the
carter-mondale
ruling
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
they
made
that
demonstration
before
the
commission,
that
they
had
substantial
bona
fide
campaign
activities
in
ten
or
more
states;
that's
an
alternative
in
addition
to
being
on
the
ballot.
and
i
believe
that's
the
route
they
use
to
show
bona
fide
candidacy,
was
existence
of
substantial
campaigning
in
ten
different
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
one
component.
there
are
three
requirements
that
are
set
forth
in
the
commission's
regulations.
and
one
of
them
is,
a
specified
amount
of
activity
in
ten
different
states,
or
placement
on
the
primary
ballot
in
ten
different
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
it
chooses
to
do
so,
it's
perfectly
free
to
negotiate
and
that's
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
right.
parties
are
always
free
to
strike
whatever
bargain
they
wish
to,
and
that's
the
commission's
expectation
in
this
area;
that
its
guidelines
and
rules
will
facilitate
private
negotiations
and
minimize
the
need
for
the
government
to
get
into
the
process.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
the
networks,
of
course,
argue
that
this
section
imposed
no
new
duty,
that
it
simply
codified
the
previously
existing
public
interest
standard.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
that's
quite
true.
under
the
old
public
interest
policy,
no
individual
candidate
had
a
right
of
affirmative
access.
he
could
not
obtain
any
relief
from
the
commission
no
matter
how
many
times
he
was
denied
access.
it
guaranteed
no
reasonable
access
or
indeed,
any
access,
to
the
individual
candidate.
it
required
only
some
political
programming
during
the
three-year
term
of
the
license.
the
broadcaster
was
at
liberty
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
campaigns
and
decide
which
were
the
most
important
and
which
it
would
sell
time
to,
and
which
it
would
not
sell
time
to.
for
example,
the
broadcaster
could
determine
that
the
campaign
for
governor
in
a
particular
year
was
more
important
than
the
campaign
for
a
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives,
and
withhold
time
from
all
of
the
candidates
in
the
congressional
race.
one
need
only
compare
this
amorphous
obligation
with
the
very
specific
obligation
imposed
by
the
new
statute
to
see
that
congress
was
embarking
on
a
new
course.
under
this
statute,
312(a)(7),
congress
has
empowered
the
commission
to
impose
sanctions
based
on
a
broadcaster's
repeated
or
willful
failure
to
sell
reasonable
amounts
of
air
time
to
an
individual
federal
candidate.
the
words
chosen
by
congress
focus
in
squarely
on
the
individual:
a
legally
qualified
candidate
must
be
afforded
the
specific
use
of
a
broadcast
station
to
advocate
his
candidacy.
under
the
statute,
the
broadcaster
exposes
himself
to
the
ultimate
sanction
of
license
revocation
if
he
unreasonably
withholds
air
time
on
two
or
more
occasions,
or
if
he
does
this
willfully
on
even
one
occasion.
in
short,
as
the
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
agreed,
this
statute
extends
its
protection
to
the
individual
federal
candidate,
a
kind
of
protection
that
was
wholly
unknown
under
the
predecessor
public
interest
standard.
in
this
connection
the
court
may
reasonably
ask
why,
if
congress
really
meant
to
codify
the
public
interest
standard
why
didn't
it
refer
to
the
elements
of
the
public
interest
standard?
why
didn't
it
say
that
the
broadcasters
should
review
state
and
federal
campaigns,
should
pick
out
the
most
important
ones,
should
give
air
time
to
some
of
them
and
withhold
air
time
from
the
others.
these
elements
of
the
public
interest
policy
are
simply
not
the
elements
prescribed
by
congress
in
312(a)(7).
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
far
from
contradicting
its
plain
meaning,
strongly
supports
the
literal
interpretation
that
the
commission
has
given.
section
312(a)(7)
was
a
central
part
of
title
i
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
title
i,
according
to
the
senate
commerce
committee,
had
two
and
only
two
purposes:
it's
first
purpose
was
to
give
candidates,
and
i
quote,
"greater
access
to
the
media,
so
that
they
may
better
explain
their
stand
on
the
issues
and
thereby
more
fully
and
completely
inform
the
voters.
"
it's
second
purpose
was
to
halt
the
spiraling
cost
of
campaigning.
now
section
312(a)(7)
doesn't
have
any
direct
relationship
to
the
goal
of
containing
campaign
costs,
but
it
does
have
a
direct
bearing
on
the
goal
of
better
informing
the
electorate,
by
focusing
in
on
the
individual
candidate
it
goes
beyond
the
old
public
interest
standard
and
affords
"greater
access
to
the
media".
congress'
intent
is
also
reflected
in
its
contemporaneous
amendment
of
another
closely
related
statutory
provision.
before
1972,
section
315
of
the
act
contained
a
proviso
which
states
flatly
that
there
was
no
duty
to
give
an
individual
candidate
affirmative
access.
the
proviso
read
as
follows:
"no
obligation
is
imposed
in
any
licensee
to
allow
the
use
of
its
station
by
any
such
candidate.
"
but
when
congress
enacted
section
312(a)(7)
it
recognized
that
this
unqualified
statement
was
no
longer
correct;
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
make
what
it
called
conforming
amendment,
to
bring
section
315
into
harmony
with
the
newly
enacted
312(a)(7).
as
amended,
section
315
now
provides
no
obligation
is
imposed
under
this
subsection
on
any
licensee
to
allow
the
use
of
its
station
by
any
such
candidate.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
came
out
of
the
conference
committee,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
qualify
its
statement
that
there
was
no
duty
to
give
affirmative
access
to
individual
candidates
and
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
that
statement
applied
only
under
section
315,
precisely
because
the
newly
enacted
section
312(a)(7)
does
obligate
broadcasters
to
afford
affirmative
access
to
individual
candidates.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
and
congress
delegated
the
enforcement
role
to
the
commission.
and
it
gave
the
commission
power
to
secure
compliance
by
the
broadcasters.
it
never
would
have
done
this
if
it
believed
that
the
networks
and
the
broadcasters
would
have
unlimited
discretion
to
withhold
air
time--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--they...
if
their
discretion
exceeds
the
bounds
of
reasoning--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
does
indeed...
and
the
final
arbiter
in
a
case
of
disagreement
is
the
commission,
because--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
don't
see
how
the
language
could
be
interpreted
to
say
that
the
final
arbiter
of
reasonableness
is
the
regulated
broadcaster,
because
the
commission
has
the
power
to
revoke
its
license
if
it
behaves
in
an
unreasonable
way.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it's
quite
similar,
your
honor,
to
the
kind
of
review
that
a
court
of
appeals
would
extend
to
an
administrative
decision,
to
see
if
the
relevant
factors
had
been
considered
and
whether
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretions--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
commission
is
disposed
to
agree
with
the
broadcaster
in
a
close
case;
it's
made
that
quite
clear,
that
it
will
defer
to
discretion
unless
there
is
a
clear
abuse.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
this
case
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
this
case--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
true.
if
the
commission
regarded
the
factual
issues
in
a
particular
case
as
close,
it
would
defer
to
the
broadcaster.
but
in
this
case
the
finding
of
violation
rested
on
what
the
commission
regarded
as
a
legal
error,
that
is,
that
these
networks
applied
blanket
rules
in
dealing
with
the
candidate.
that
is,
they
would
not
receive
the
individual
request
and
analyze
it
in
its
own
particularized
context.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
our
view,
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
networks
deny
or
cut
back
requests
for
air
time
from
candidates
on
the
view
that
this
was
too
costly
or
that
it
was
contributing
to
mounting
campaign
costs.
and
one
reason--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--one
reason
for
not
allowing
the
networks
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
inquiry
is
that
there
is
no
basis
for
asserting
that
granting
air
time
to
candidates
is
going
to
increase
costs.
this
is
the
most
cost
effective
means
of
communication.
if
the
court
were
to
compare
the
$186,000
price
tag
on
this
half
hour
to
the
cost
of
stuffing
envelopes--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
quite
agree
with
the
decision
there.
in
that
case,
the
vice
in
the
access
scheme
was
that
it
had
no
congressional
sanction,
whereas
in
this
case
congress
has
prescribed
a
specific
access
scheme
for
a
narrowly
defined
class
of
candidates,
federal
candidates
for
office.
in
the
dnc
case
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
had
constructed
an
access
scheme
virtually
out
of
whole
cloth,
there
was
no
basis
in
statute
or
in
prior
commission
precedent.
and
in
fact,
the
statute
contained
a
provision...
section
3(h)
that
militated
against
the
access
scheme
that
the
court
evolved
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
commission
takes
the
position
that
in
that
area
it
will
make
its
own
judgment
about
whether
the
campaign
is--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that
is
an
area
where
the
commission
has
said
there
is
lesser
discretion
in
deciding
when
the
campaign
begins,
it
said
it
will
listen
to
the
positions
of
the
networks...
and
the
candidates,
and
make
its
own
judgment.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
and
it
did
just
that,
in
light
of
an
abundance
of
evidence
showing
that
the
campaign
was
in
full
swing
in
november--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
the
evidence
is
against
the
network,
that's
correct.
and
here
it
was
clearly
against
the
networks
because
the
campaign
activities
were
in
full
swing
by
anybody's
definition
except
these
networks.
if
the
court
looks
at--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--acted
unreasonably
in
concluding
that
the
campaign
wasn't
in
full
swing.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor
it
was.
and
it
was
a
sentence
or
two
removed
from
312(a)(7).
the
commission
might
have
interpreted
the
statute
to
require
the
offer
of
fixed
quantities
of
time
under
a
particular
time
schedule
to
try
to
mitigate
some
of
the
complexities
that
we're
talking
about,
under
highly
specific
rules.
and
it
sought
the
views
of
the
networks
on
this
kind
of
a
proposal
in
1978.
the
networks
vehemently
opposed
this
kind
of
an
approach,
urging
the
commission
to
continue
to
proceed
on
a
case-by-case
basis
analyzing
the
reasonableness
of
their
conduct
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
or
a
case-by-case
basis.
in
its
comments
to
the
commission
at
that
time,
nbc
stressed
the
importance
of
individual
treatment.
it
stated
in
its
brief,
a
copy
of
which
i
have
lodged
with
the
court
yesterday,
and
i
quote,
"different
candidates
have
different
campaign
strategies.
"
"one
will
concentrate
on
30-minute
programs
of
prime
time,
another
may
want
10-second
spots
during
fringe
programming.
"
"a
third
will
seek
exposure
around
news
and
public
affairs
programming.
"
"we
believe
it
would
be
most
difficult
for
the
commission
to
promulgate
any
rule
that
could
take
all
of
these
diverse
strategies
and
campaign
needs
into
account.
"
the
commission
essentially
agreed
with
that
assessment.
it
concluded
that
it
would
be
best
to
adopt
general
guidelines
under
congress'
rule
of
reason,
to
facilitate
individual
negotiations.
and
to
minimize
the
need
for
governmental
intervention.
one
of
the
guidelines
of
course,
is
that
broadcasters
need
not
extend
any
access
even
if
the
federal
candidate
is
legally
qualified,
unless
the
campaign
is
fully
underway
as
evidenced
by
objective
facts
that
we've
been
discussing.
the
second
guideline
is
that
once
the
campaign
begins,
broadcasters
may
not
enforce
across
the
board
or
blanket
policies
in
rejecting
requests
for
time.
they
must
be
willing
to
negotiate
and
attempt
to
accommodate--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
can't
state
it
any
better
than
nbc
did
in
the
passage
that
i
just
quoted.
the
different
campaign
strategies
that
the
candidates
pursue
are
vitally
important
to
communicating
their
own
message,
and
to
adopt
a
simple
rule
that
only
five-minute
spots
will
be
allowed
or
you
won't
allow
access
in
the
month
of
december,
that
can
interfere
fundamentally
with
the
strategy
of
a
particular
candidate.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it's
the
commission's
duty
to
interpret
the
reasonable
access
standard
and
in
its
view--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no.
it's
the
reasonable
access
requirement--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--balanced
against
the
legitimate
concerns
of
the
broadcasters.
the
commission
has
concluded
that
there
really
are
two
interests
here
that
have
to
be
weighed;
reasonableness
looks
both
ways,
to
the
candidate
and
to
the
broadcaster--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
said
that
it
is
improper
not
to
weigh
the
needs
of
the
particular
candidate
and
the
particular
case,
but
you
also
must
weigh
the
legitimate
concerns
of
the
broadcaster
in
the
same
balancing
process;
that
is,
multiplicity
of
candidates
or
program
disruption.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
accommodation
of
both
of
the
interests
that
the
commission
believes
best
strikes
the
balance
of
reasonableness
under
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
it's
necessary
to
weigh--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
correct.
it's
necessary
to
weigh
the
individual
request.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
no,
the
per
se
rule
means
that
you
have
to
engage
in
an
individual
ad
hoc
weigh
in--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--is
permissible...
that's...
that
is
correct.
and
the
networks
expend
a
great
deal
of
time
attacking
this
guidelines
but
i
would
submit
that
they
have
not
demonstrated
that
this
approach
is
patently
irrational
or
that
it
conflicts
with
any
provision
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
the
commission
reviews
that
to
that
to
see
if
it
really
is
within
the
bounds
of
discretion
and
one
of
the
standards
that
it
has
prescribed
to
make
the
process
conform
in
its
view
with
the
statutory
requirement
is
that
no
blanket
rules
may
be
prescribed.
and
the
question
for
a
reviewing
court
is
whether
it's
patently
irrational,
arbitrary
or
capricious
for
the
commission
to
adopt
this
approach,
and
we
submit
that
it
isn't.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
precisely
the
role
congress
has
given
the
commission,
to
sit
as
umpire
in
cases
of
disagreement
over
reasonable
access
issues--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--not
deciding
what
their
needs
are.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
commission's
only
review--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--with
respect
to
that
issue--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--no
sir.
it's
only
role
in
reviewing
is
to
determine
if
the...
if
the
networks
have
considered
the
request
on
an
individual
basis,
and
if
so,
if
they
have
weighed
it
against
the
factors
that
the
commission
has
specified
as
counterveiling
factors...
if
the
networks
have
done
that,
they
are
home
free.
there's
no
violation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
sanction
that's
expressly
prescribed
is
revocation
of
broadcast
license,
and
each
of
these
networks
is
a
licensee
of
five
vhf
television
stations.
the
commission
staff
believes
that
in
addition
to
revocation
there
is
a
cease
and
desist
remedy,
cease
and
desist
order
that's
available,
but
that
hasn't
been
litigated.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
statute
requires
either
repeated
or
willful
misconduct.
now,
if
there
had
been
no
petition
for
appellate
review
and
the
commission
had
entered
the
order
that
it
did
and
the
networks
continued
to
withhold
access,
at
that
point,
arguably
you
would
have
willful
misconduct.
but
it
requires
either
willfulness
or
repetitive
misconduct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no.
but
it's
essential
that
the
commission
adjudicate
a
specific
complaint
such
as
this
to
see
if
in
the
future
there
is
in
fact
a
pattern
of
repetition.
that's
why
the
commission
takes
the
first
case.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
determine
if
there
was--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--that's
correct.
it
would
determine
if
there
was
an
unreasonable
withholding,
and
then
if
there
was
a
second
such
adjudication,
that
would
lead
to
the
imposition
of
sanctions
under
the
statute.
but
it
doesn't
determine
the
first--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--precisely.
and
the
broadcasters
have
urged
the
commission
to
do
just
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
they
welcome
this
because
it
prevents
a
pattern
of
misconduct
from
turning
into
something
that
later
would
result
in
revocation.
and
that's
precisely
why
they
urged
us
to
follow
this
approach.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
approved
that
approach.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well
in...
the
commission
has
divided
up
the
issues,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
campaign
has
started
it
makes
its
own
independent
determination.
but
on
the
question
whether
the
broadcaster
has
balanced
the
individual
interest
against
the
broadcaster's
own
counterveiling
interests,
in
this
area,
they
will
not
intrude
unless
the
decision
is
clearly
erroneous,
whether
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--this
is
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
reasonable
access
requirement
and
it
was
intended
to
confer
greater
discretion
on
broadcasters
than
would
otherwise
exist
if
the
commission
determined
that
de
novo.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired,
and
i
thank
the
court.
