justice
jr.
but
i
gather,
mr.
abrams,
you
do
agree
that
if
there's
a
violation
of
312(a)(7)
that
the
commission
finds
and
the
only
sanctions
it
may
impose
are
immediate
revocation
or
wait
until
license
renewal
time.
are
there
any
other
sanctions
the
commission
can...
impose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it
that
would
depend
on
whether
carter-mondale
still
wanted
the
time
at
the
time
you
were
now
required
to
give
it
to
them.
justice
jr.
of
course
this
statute
applies
not
only
to
presidential
elections,
but
to
any
federal
elective
office,
doesn't
it?
justice
jr.
congressional
races
and
senatorial
races?
justice
jr.
any
problems
arisen
under
it
in
connection
with
such
races
yet?
