justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
abrams,
do
you
deny
that
the
commission
could
take
that
into
consideration
at
the
time
the
station's
license
comes
up
for
renewal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
same
way
any
of
the
other
conditions
for
license
renewal
could
be
considered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
grant
the
commission
here?
or
affirm
the
commission's
doing
here
that
was
different
from
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
commission
doesn't
claim
any
authority
to
go
further
and...
or...
require
you
at
a
particular
point
to
sell
time?
or
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
ask
you
first,
why
did
the
commission
go
after
the
networks
rather
than
stations,
since
networks
aren't
licensed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
only
the
licenses
of
those
particular
stations
that
would
be
subject
to
revocation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
the
time
of
the
carter-mondale
ruling,
was
that
the
ticket
on
the
ballot
in
ten
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
their
definition
of
a
legally
qualified
candidate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
was
the
so-called
conforming
amendment
to
section
315
contained
in
the
same
statute
at
large
as
the
312(a)(7)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
4(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that...
describing
the
commission
proceeding,
it
ordered
the
networks
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act.
now
what
would
have
been
the
sanction
had
the
networks
not
have
complied
with
the
orders
of--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
could
it,
right
then,
revoke
the
license?
