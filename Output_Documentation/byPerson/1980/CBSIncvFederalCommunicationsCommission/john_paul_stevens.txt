do
the
networks
have
an
obligation
to
obey
the
fairness
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
question
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
individual
stations
do,
and
most,
many
individual
stations
are
affiliated
with
one
network
or
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
statutory
provisions
related
to
the
fairness
doctrine
that
apply
to
the
networks
as
opposed
to
licensees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
how
many
of
these
37
rulings
were
before
this
ruling
and
how
many
after
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
could
just
stop
there
for
a
moment,
mr.
shapiro.
why
is
a
blanket
rule...
say
we
don't
want
anything
for
two
weeks
or
three
weeks,
necessarily
arbitrary?
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
certain
element
of
reasonableness
in
saying
even
though
the
campaign
has
begun,
we
think
in
terms
of
interest
and
orderly
programming,
and
not
getting
too
many
obligations
too
soon,
we'd
rather
wait
till...
for
30
days.
why
is
it
necessarily
unreasonable--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well
it
may
not
give
the
man
the
strategy
he
wants
but
does
it
necessarily
violate
either
the
requirement
of
reasonable
amounts
of
time
or
reasonable
access?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
the
two
requirements
that
the
networks
must
meet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
would
agree
it
doesn't
necessarily
violate
the
reasonable
amount
of
time
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
reasonable
access.
and
the
reasonable
access
must
always
reflect
what
the
candidate
wants?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
as
i
understand
your
point
earlier,
it
didn't
look
both
ways,
it
said
there's
kind
of
a
flat
ban
against
flat
bans.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abrams,
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question
if
i
may.
your
position
is
that
the
amendment
made
no
change
in
the
statute,
merely
codified
it,
the
pre-existing
law.
and
mr.
shapiro
suggests
that
under
pre-existing
law,
under
the
public
interest
standard
you
could
have
excluded
entirely
coverage
for
certain
minor
campaigns,
for
example,
but
that
now
you
could
not
do
that
because
of
the
legally
qualified
candidate
language.
how
do
you
respond
to
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he's
talking
about
other
campaigns.
