justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
abrams,
how
is
the...
i
take
it
that
it
is
possible
for
a
network
to
violate
312(a)(7)
by
certain
kinds
of
conduct
even
within
your
construction
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
the
commission
go
about
remedying
that,
you
say
there
would
be
a
complaint
and
then
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
the
commission
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
issue
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
no
authority
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
or
to
order
you
to
do
anything,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder,
is
that
what
a
complaint
says
when
it
is
filed
with
the
commission,
the
network
has
violated
312(a)(7)
and
therefore
you
should
revoke
its
license?
is
that
what
it
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
i
take
it
that
right
on
its
face,
that
the
commission
did
violate...
if
the
network
did
violate
the
312(a)(7)
and
it
was
sustained
in
court,
and
as
final
judgment
the
commissioner
actually
could
revoke
the
license
without
waiting
for
license
renewal
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
really
all
the
commission
does
is
issue
a
declaratory
judgment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
then
the
network
has
to
decide
what
it's
supposedly
going
to
do
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
commission,
at
the
end
of
its
declaratory
judgment
it
says
we
find
that
you
have
violated
the
section
but
we
don't
propose
now
to
revoke
your
license,
we'll
just
take
it
into
account
at
some
time...
i
take
it
there's
never
been
any
question
that
you
can
get
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
that
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
case
is
still
a
live
case
because,
i
take
it,
you
think
the
commission
has...
it
maintains
its
view
and
that
you
will
be
in
trouble
with
them
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
long
as
they
are
still
ahead
at
license
renewal
time
the
rule
is
there,
isn't
it?
justice
white
you
haven't...
that
isn't
one
of
your
points
raised?
justice
white
the
networks'
license
could
never
be
revoked.
justice
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
has
it
been
determined
whether
if
it
did
use
cease
and
desist
orders,
whether
the
statute
would
authorize
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statute
would
authorize
the
commission
to,
at
some
point
in
the
process,
just
to
announce
that
the
campaign
has
now
begun,
without
purporting
to
sit
in
review
of
a
network's
judgment
as
to
when
the
campaign
has
begun?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you're
going
to
tell
us
how
(a)(7)
changes
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
agree
that
if
it
hadn't
imposed
a
new
duty,
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
would
have
been
infirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
surely
there's
a...
i
know
court,
not
agencies,
get
away
with
all
sorts
of
things.
there's
a
range
of
conduct
that
would
be
within
their
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn't
be
just
one
thing,
it
could
be...
i
suppose,
a
network
might
reasonably
decide
that
within...
on
any
day
within
three
or
four
months
that
a
campaign
had
begun.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
any
one
of
them
would
be
reasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
commission
thought
that
it
would
have
preferred
the
decision
to
be
somewhere
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
shapiro,
you
think
the
commission
in
this
case,
in
deciding
there
had
been
a
violation,
asked
the
question
was
it
reasonable
for
the
networks
to
decide
that
the
campaign
hadn't
begun?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you...
i
thought
just
a
while
ago
you
talked...
i
thought
you
agreed
a
moment
ago
that
the
commission
should...
it
should
determine
whether
the
networks
judgment
about
when
the
campaign
had
begun
was
reasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but...
doesn't
it
nevertheless
have
to
conclude
that
the
network
made
an
unreasonable
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
does
that
in
a
sense
that
we're
describing...
we're
just
going
to
decide
for
ourselves
when
it
begins,
as
a
matter
of
objective
fact,
and
if
the
network
chose
a
different
date
it
was
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
bottom
line,
was
it
bottom
line
then,
or
was
it
that
the
networks
had
acted
unreasonably?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
turning
the
thing
upside
down,
isn't
it?
it's
a
reasonable...
the
networks
have
to
give
reasonable
access
and
they,
in
the
first
instance
decide
what's
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
i
take
it
then,
you
seriously
contend
that
congress
intended
that
the
commission
play
a
very
central
role,
as
a
broker,
in
political
campaigns
in
deciding
access
to
television?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
deciding
what
the
needs
of
candidates
are
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
just
said
they
had
to...
they
must
take
account
of
what
the
candidate's
style
is,
of
what
their
approach
is
and
what
their
needs
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
commission,
if
it
disagrees--
justice
byron
r.
white
--with
the...
i
take
it,
from
what
you
say,
that
if
the
commission
disagrees
with
the
networks'
judgment
about
what
the
needs
of
the
candidate
are,
they
haven't
given
him
reasonable
access?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
doesn't
a
complaint
have
to
allege
a
willful
violation,
even
to
energize
the
commission?
i
mean,
the
statute
says
repeated
or
willful...
no
question
here,
there
wasn't
any
question
about
repeated
refusal,
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
commission
will
take
a
case
if
a
claimant
says
this
hasn't
been
repeated
yet,
this
is
the
initial
instance
and
as
far
as
i
know,
it
isn't
willful,
they
are
in
perfectly
good
faith,
they
just
haven't
interpreted...
you
mean
the
commission
would
get
underway
right
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
even
a
claim
of
willfulness?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
adjudicate
the
very
first...
suppose
there's
no
claim
of
willfulness,
and
the
commission
isn't
looking
for
willfulness,
the
commission
will
take
on
the
very
first
refusal
because
it
may
be...
it
will
be
repeated?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree,
mr.
abrams,
that
they...
that
this
process
of
undertaking
these
cases
where
there
is
no
claim
of
repeated
violations,
no
claim
of
a
willful
violation;
only
a
claim
of
an
unreasonable
one
and
go
at
it
the
very
first
time
around?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
was
never
a
claim--
justice
byron
r.
white
--oh
was
there
a
claim
of
willful
misconduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
ought
to
actually
claim
a...
a
willful
misconduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
gathered
mr.
shapiro
indicated
that
they
would
undertake
these
adjudications
even
if
there's
no
claim
of...
either
of
repeated
or
willful
misconduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
willful
in
the
sense...
surely
they
know
what
they
are
doing?
not
unconscious.
