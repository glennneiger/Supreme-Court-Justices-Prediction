mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
consolidated
case
comes
to
this
court
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
involves
a
decision
of
that
court
affirming
two
4
to
3
rulings
of
the
federal
communications
commission
that
abc,
cbs
and
nbc
violated
section
312(a)(7)
of
the
federal
communications
act
by
declining
to
sell
one
half
hour
of
prime
time
on
their
networks
to
the
carter-mondale
committee
during
a
specified
four-day
period,
during
the
first
week
in
december
of
1979...
a
time
11
months
before
the
national
election,
8
months
before
the
democratic
national
convention,
almost
three
months
before
the
first
primary,
and
over
a
month
and
a
half
before
the
first
official
contest
of
any
sort
in
which
there
was
voter
participation...
the
iowa
caucus.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
this
was
not
an
application
for
time
in
iowa,
with
respect
to
the
iowa
caucus...
which
was,
as
i've
said,
about
a
month
and
a
half
away;
this
was
for
time
from
the
national
networks
to
be
broadcast
on
those
national
networks
around
the
nation.
and
it
is
the
failure
of
the
networks
to
sell
the
precise
time
sought
at
the
time
it
was
sought
that
the
commission
has
found
in
the
statute's
language,
unreasonable;
even
though
cbs,
for
example,
immediately
offered
to
sell
two
five-minute
periods
of
time
during
the
time-periods
that
it
was
sought,
and
abc
offered
to
sell
time
in
the
first
week
of
january
of
1980.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
easily
stated
and,
i
think,
not
disputed.
in
october
1979,
letters
were
written
on
behalf
of
the
carter-mondale
campaign
to
each
of
the
three
networks,
seeking
to
purchase
a
half
hour
of
time
during
specified
time-periods
in
the
first
week
of
december.
it
was
said
in
these
letters
that
the
needs
of
the
carter-mondale
campaign
were
such
that
the
time
was
required
to
kick
off
the
campaign.
each
of
the
networks
declined
to
sell
precisely
the
time
that
was
requested,
on
the
evenings
that
they
were
sought.
each
made
a
submission,
first
to
the
carter-mondale
campaign
by
way
of
response,
and
then
to
the
commission.
when
a
complaint
was
filed
there,
setting
forth
their
reasons,
as
i
said...
cbs
made
an
immediate
offer
to
sell
two
five-minute
periods
of
time;
abc
advised
that
it
would
sell
time
in
early
1980
and
prior
to
the
time
the
commission
ruled,
offered
to
sell
time
in
the
first
week
of
january,
1980.
nbc
initially
declined
to
sell
the
half-hour
at
the
time
that
it
was
sought,
and
when
a
half
hour
was
sought
in
early
january,
nbc
offered
to
sell
it
at
that
time.
the
length
of
time
before
the
election
and
the
amount
of
potential
requests
for
equal
opportunities
under
section
315
of
the
federal
communications
act,
and
other
requests
for
time
were
cited
separately
by
each
of
the
networks
in
their
responses.
abc
and
nbc
pointed,
for
example,
to
the
fact
that
they
had
not
sold
national
network
time
in
the
1976
election
until
march
and
april
of
that
election
year.
cbs
pointed
to
the
fact
that
it
had
already
received
requests
from
the
connally
campaign
on
september
14th
and
the
reagan
campaign
on
september
21.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
was
in
effect
in
1976,
it
never
resulted
in
any
litigation.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
it
was
passed
in
1972.
mr.
floyd
abrams
seventy-two,
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
on
its
face,
this
statute,
which
is
section
312(a)(7)
is
one
of
7
subsections
of
section
312(a)
of
the
federal
communications
act,
setting
forth
acts
that
can
lead
to
license
revocation.
the
list
is
simple,
of
course
i
won't
read
it,
but
it
includes
such
things
as
the
making
of
false
statements
on
the
application
for
a
license,
the
violation
of
cease
and
desist
orders
of
the
commission,
the
willful
or
repeated
failures
to
operate
substantially
as
set
forth
in
the
license
and
the
like.
none
of
these
imposed
any
new,
substantive
obligations.
all
of
them
imposed
the
risk
of
sanctions
upon
the
networks
or
of
the
stations
involved,
broadcast
stations,
it
was
said
if
there
was
violation.
our
section,
the
one
at
issue
today
as
adopted
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act
prohibits
the
following:
willful
or
repeated
failure
to
allow
reasonable
access
to
or
to
permit
purchase
of
reasonable
amounts
of
time
of
time
for
the
use
of
a
broadcast
station
by
a
legally
qualified
candidate
for
federal
elective
office
on
behalf
of
his
candidacy.
if
the
court
please,
it
is
now
the
position
of
the
commission
that
the
plain
meaning
of
those
words
leads
inexorably
to
the
conclusion
that
abc,
say,
which
offered
to
sell
time
in
january
1980
rather
than
december
1979,
is
in
plain
violation
of
the
statute.
we
maintain
that
that
is
not
so--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--we
think
that
it
was
proper
to
take
into
account
a
charge
by
a
complainant
at
the
time
the
charge
is
made,
justice
rehnquist,
the
violation
of
section
312(a)(7).
mr.
floyd
abrams
it's
an
appropriate
thing
to
be
considered
then;
the
fashion
in
which
the
commission
has
handled
it
is
the
fashion
akin
to
the
way
its
handled
fairness
doctrine
complaints,
which
is
to
say,
on
a
case
by
case
approach,
which
we
think
is
an
entirely
proper
way
to
approach
it,
we
do
not
object
to
the
fact
that
when
a
complaint
is
made
with
respect
to
section
312(a)(7),
the
commission
makes
a
ruling
then
as
to
whether
the
complaint
is
justified
or
not.
but
i
agree
that
if
someone
believes
at
license
renewal
time
that
there
is
a
violation
of
any
portion
of
section
312(a),
that's
an
appropriate
thing
to
be
considered
by
the
commission.
mr.
floyd
abrams
our
objection
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
propriety
of
a
complaint
being
filed.
our
objection
is
that
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
commission
applied
the
wrong
standard
in
making
its
decision
as
to
whether
the
networks
acted
reasonably.
so
we
don't
come
to
you
to
say
that
a
candidate
may
not
file
a
complaint
in
front
of
the
commission
alleging
violation
of
what
he
says
are
the
terms
of
the
federal
communications
act.
he
may,
and
indeed
that
was
true
long
before
section
312(a)(7)
was
in
the
books;
that
was
true
under
the
public
interest
standard
as
well,
because
if
one
thing
i
think
is
common
ground
between
us
here,
it
is
that
at
least
since
this
court's
decision
in
wday
and
really
long
before,
it
has
been
clear
that
broadcasters
have
been
obliged
under
the
public
interest
standard
to
sell
some
time
to
candidates
and
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
their
public
interest
requirements
if
they
refused
to
do
so.
now
there
was
a
different
standard
applied
under
the
public
interest
standard
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
i'm
here
today.
but
there
was
never
any
question
but
that
a
candidate
could
file
a
complaint
in
front
of
the
commission
and
indeed
candidates
did
file
complaints
in
front
of
the
commission
long
before
section
312(a)(7)
existed
and
that
the
commission
would
rule
on
the
propriety
of
the
conduct
of
the
station
involved.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes,
mr.
justice--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--a
complaint
would
be
filed,
there
would
be
an
adjudication--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--as
a
practical
matter,
the
commission
would
have
to
do
no
more
than
it
did
here,
to
make
a
ruling
that
the
network
had
acted,
or
that
the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
is,
as
it
were,
a
declaration--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
has
the
power,
under
312(a)(7)
only
to
revoke.
it--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no
sir.
what
the
carter-mondale
campaign
said
was
that
you
should
tell
the
network
to
sell
the
time
on
one
of
the
evenings
that
we
are
requesting
it
and
that
is,
in
effect,
precisely
what
the
commission
did.
now
if
that
had
not
been
stayed
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
it
was
and
by
the
judicial
process
as
it
was,
and
if
the
networks
had
violated
that
direction
at
the
very
least
they
would
have
acted
at
considerable
peril,
surely
with
respect
to
license
renewal
time,
having
violated
a
direct
command
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
what
their
obligation
was.
and
that's
the
same
way
the
fairness
doctrine
worked...
the
fairness
doctrine--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--if
there
were
a
willful
or
repeated
failure
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--we
would,
i
take
it,
be
arguing
it
was
of
course
not
willful
nor
repeated
nor
existing--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--but
what
the
statutory
language
provides
is
that
if
that
occurs
that
this
is
an
allowable
sanction.
and
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
fact
that--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
and
the
network...
the
station
understands--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--well
it
doesn't
have
an
awful
lot
of
choice,
mr.
justice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it's
appropriate
at
the
renewal
proceedings
for
the
commission
to
take
into
account
the
conduct
of
the
broadcaster,
including
to
be
sure--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--compliance...
yes
sir,...
it's
compliance
with
its
public
interest
obligation.
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
can
say,
easily,
why
the
networks
and
the
stations
much
prefer,
under
the
fairness
doctrine
and
under
this
system,
the
idea
of
case
by
case
adjudication
is
that
it
is
to
say
the
least,
an
uncomfortable
sense
to
be
met
for
the
first
time
at
license
renewal
time
with
a
series
of
charges
to
the
effect
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
public
interest
standard
or
some
other
obligations.
but
i
can't
tell
you,
if
somebody
comes
in
and
makes
a
sufficient
showing
of
failure
to
abide
by
the
public
interest
obligations
of
the
station,
that
that's
an
improper
thing
for
the
commission
to
consider;
it
is
indeed
a
proper
thing
for
the
commission
to
consider.
but
so
far
as
possible,
it's
best
to
do
this
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
for
one
thing,
it
allows
case
by
case
curing
of
the
problems
if
indeed
stations
are
found
to
have
violated
any
obligations.
in
a
fairness
context,
for
example,
it
allows
the
station
to
do
something
about
that
which
it
has
been
accused
of
not
serving
the
public
about.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
don't
know
of
any
other
sanctions
which
the
commission
can
impose,
i
think
it
fair
to
say
as
a
practical
matter,
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
conclusion
by
the
commission
of
a
violation
of
section
312(a)(7)
which
is
affirmed
by
the
courts
or
not
appealed
to
the
courts,
would
have
more
than
a
little
effect
on
the
conduct
of
the
station
involved.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there's
never
been
any
question
about
it,
no
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
you'd
do
best
to
ask
that
question
to
my
friend
on
my
right.
the
commission
to
my
knowledge
has
not
taken
that
position...
what
it
did
do
in
this
case,
for
example,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
was
to
direct
the
networks
to
inform
the
commission
how
it
intended
to
comply
with
section
312(a)(7)
given
the
conclusion
of
the
commission
that
there
has
been
a
failure
to
comply
by
not
selling
the
time
on
the
nights
which
it
was--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--it
would
depend,
in
this
case,
indeed
it
did
depend,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
they
withdrew
their
request
in
light
of
the
iranian
crisis,
made
a
new
request
for
time
which
was
granted
by
in
fact,
all
of
the
networks.
mr.
floyd
abrams
it
is
live
in
that
sense,
it
is
live
in
the
southern
pacific
sense,
it
is
live
in...
for
another
reason,
and
that
is
that
the
commission
takes
the
position
in
this
very
case
with
respect
to
these
very
networks
that
there
is
"continuing
legal
and
practical
effect
of
their
ruling,
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
they
have
not
imposed
any
sanctions--
"
mr.
floyd
abrams
--yes,
well
it
is
always
there
and
of
course,
as
i
said
first,
it
is
a
recurrent
controversy
and
indeed
it
is
a
peculiarly
recurring
controversy
in
the
context
of
election
campaigns.
and
as
the
court
suggested
just
last
week
in
the
wisconsin
primary
case,
that's
even
a
more
special
situation,
in
which
parties
have
to
have
some
way
to
get
to
court
to
have
a
resolution
either
prior
to
election
or
after
election,
to
find
out
what
the
rules
of
the
game
are.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
argued
that
below,
we
took
the
position
below
that
section
312(a)(7)
does
not
apply
to
the
networks
because
it
says
what
it
says.
mr.
floyd
abrams
and
indeed,
because
in
the
ordinary
case
it
wouldn't
make
sense
for
it
to
apply
to
the
networks.
our
example
earlier
is
a
useful
one.
the
commission
held
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
proposition
that
it
did
apply
to
networks.
we
have
not
pressed
that
point
here,
but--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
floyd
abrams
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
the
view
that
we
took,
as
i've
indicated...
we
did
not
press
that
point
in
this
court.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
networks
don't
have
licenses.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
and
that's...
that
was
one
of
the
things
again,
that
we
urged
below,
and
i
begin
to
be
sorry
we
didn't
raise
here
perhaps.
mr.
floyd
abrams
the
networks
have
been
held
by
commission
practice...
yes
sir,
to
be
obliged
to
obey
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
i
believe
the
networks--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no
sir.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
there
are
no
distinct
statutory
provisions.
the
only
fairness
doctrine
requirement
is
in
section
315,
it
is
not
couched
in
the
same
language
as
this,
but
the
fairness
doctrine
has
been...
has
arisen
in
a
variety
of
cases
and
controversies
before
the
commission.
some
bought
by
the
networks
after
they
had
lost
in
the
commission
itself,
and
we
have
not
taken
the
position
and
do
not
take
the
position
that
it
cannot
apply
to
the
networks
in
that
sense.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes
sir.
networks
have
no
power
to
require
affiliated
stations
to
carry
it
and
can
do
nothing
and
would
do
nothing
to
require
the
affiliates
to
carry--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--no,
the
cost
of
the
time
would
be
arranged
beforehand...
would
have
to
do
of
course
with
the
effect
of
the
broadcast...
but
the
time
of
this
sort
would
be
paid...
the
amount
would
be
paid
to
the
network
itself,
because
the
time
would
be
purchased
from
the
network
itself.
but
there's
absolutely
nothing
the
network
can
do,
to
require,
for
example,
that
these
advertisements...
if
they
were...
if
the
networks
have
to
carry
them,
be
shown
in
iowa.
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
said
from
the
start
to
the
commission
was...
and
to
the
carter
campaign...
was,
that
if
what
you're
thinking
about
is
the
iowa
caucus,
which
is
what's
coming
up
close,
why
don't
you
go
to
the
iowa
stations
and
seek
to
buy
time.
and
it
has
always
been
our
view
that
a
very
different
kind
of
reasonableness
standards
would
govern
a
request
brought
47
days
before
the
iowa
caucus
in
iowa,
than
would
occur
eight
months
before
the
democratic
national
convention
when
a
nationwide
broadcast
is
sought.
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
nature
of
the
statute
as
we
see
it.
and
to
start
out,
by
saying
this,
i
think
it
is
common
ground
here
that
unless
the
statute
significantly
changed
the
public
interest
standard
as
it
previously
existed,
we
would
not
be
here
today
and
the
broadcasters
would
have
prevailed
at
the
commission
level.
i
think
my
friends
on
my
right
would
agree
to
that,
it
is
based
on
the
case
law,
a
correct
proposition.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
issue
for
consideration
by
the
court
is
whether
section
312(a)(7)
in
fact
changed
the
pre-existing
case
law,
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
asserted
by
the
commission.
we
urge
upon
you,
among
other
things,
the
fact
that
this
issue
has
to
a
considerable
degree
at
least,
been
before
this
court
before.
in
1973,
in
the
cbs
v.
dnc
case,
this
court
had
occasion
to
analyze
the
nature
of
broadcast
regulation
and
to
go
through,
at
considerable
length,
the
fact
that
congress
had,
in
the
court's
terms,
time
and
again
rejected
systems
of
mandatory
access.
the
court
in
the
course
of
demonstrating
that
congress
had
rejected
such
systems
time
and
again,
cited
to
this
statute
and
referred
to
it
as
a
codification
of
prior
practice.
the
court
had
the
benefit
at
that
time
of
a
brief
amicus
curiae
filed
by
the
united
states
and
the
fcc,
urging
precisely
that
position
upon
it.
we
believe
what
the
court
said
then,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
just
the
footnote
which
refers
to
section
312(a)(7)...
that
we
rely
upon
here,
but
the
text
and
the
theme
of
the
court's
opinion
there
that
we
rely
upon.
the
court
had
before
it
then
the
brief
of
the
fcc,
it
had
before
it
the
statute
and
the
statute
was
then
brand
new.
we
believe
what
the
court
said
in
'73
in
dnc,
about
this
issue
was
correct
notwithstanding
that
has
now
been
characterized
by
the
commission
as
a
decision
which
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
an
interpretation
by
the
agency
with
the
obligation
of
enforcing
it,
even
though
there
was
a
brief
by
that
very
agency
before
it,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
judge
bazelon
for
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
court
had
strayed
far
from
what
was
before
it
and
had
treated
the
issue
in
a
cursory
fashion.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
fair
statement
and
i
urge
upon
the
court
the
conclusions
reached
on
it
before.
we
believe
the
intent
of
section
312(a)(7)
is
clear
and
that
it
may
be
found
in
the
single
piece
of
legislative
history
that
one
and
all
agree
is
the
most
important
piece
and
that
is
the
report
of
the
senate
commerce
committee
which
put
this
into
the
bill
for
the
first
time.
and
they
could
not
have
made
clearer
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
that
in
the
context
of
the
passage
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act
of
1971,
which
limited
campaign
expenditures
by
all
forms
of
media,
which
was
enacting
a
lowest
unit
charge
provision,
that
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
no
diminution
in
the
language
of
the
senate
report
in
the
amount
of
coverage
by
broadcasters.
the
broadcasters
would
not
then
say
we
don't
have
to
carry
political
advertisements.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
bill,
was
to
codify
the
pre-existing
obligation
of
that
sort
and
it
was
to
codify
it
and
do
more,
it
was
to
add
a
sanction
in
section
312(a)(7),
and
that
is
precisely
what
it
did.
what
the
commission's
decision
does
is,
we
believe,
entirely
inconsistent,
not
only
with
the
notion
of
codification,
but
with
the
theory
of
broadcast
regulation
and
of
political
neutrality
of
the
commission,
as
we
have
known
it
in
this
country.
at
the
heart
of
the
commission's
decision
is
the
notion
that
this
is
a
kind
of
candidates'
entitlement
bill,
that
this
is
legislation
which
leads,
as
a
first
question
to
what
does
the
candidate
want
and
how
can
we
give
it
to
him.
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
say
that
one
issue
which
previously
had
always
been
decided
as
part
of
the
reasonableness
standard
applied
in
the
context
of
public
interest
cases,
that
is
the
question
of
when
to
start
selling
time
is
not
a
factor
at
all;
that
that
is
a
legal
objective
fact
and
that
the
commission
will
tell
us
hereafter
when
a
campaign
is
"in
full
swing".
they
have
thus
taken
out
of
the
equation
which
used
to
govern
the
whole
notion
of
reasonableness
any
ability
of
the
broadcasters
to
factor
in
when,
except
to
say,
we
will
tell
you
when
the
campaign
is
in
full
swing
and
once
it
is
in
full
swing
then
your
legal
obligations
attach
and
then
we
will
apply
a
kind
of
equation
of
which
the
single
most
important
element
is
the
candidate's
needs.
it
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
we,
networks,
and
then
they,
the
commission,
no
less,
are
to
get
involved
in
the
question
of
what
the
candidate
wants,
and
to
some
extent
at
least,
why
he
wants
it.
now
the
commission
has
tried,
in
the
latter
stages
of
this
case,
to
retreat
from
that
and
to
say
that
you
can
take
the
candidates'
needs
as
expressed
by
them.
but
the
problem
is
that
the
opinion
of
the
commission
and
the
opinion
of
judge
bazelon
below
make
very
clear
that
what
we
are
then
allowed
to
say,
what
we
are
almost
obliged
to
say
as
networks,
is
something
like
this:
a
candidate
says
he
wants
two
hours
to
do
a
program
on
foreign
policy,
to
express
his
views.
we
are
then
to
look
and
see
if
he
can
do
that,
a
foreign
policy
speech,
in
something
less
than
two
hours
and
we
are
supposed
to
get
back
to
the
candidate,
make
a
judgment,
get
back
to
the
commission,
have
a
federal
agency
no
less,
rule
on
the
question
of
our
reasonableness
in
telling
that
candidate
that
two
hours
is
longer
than
he
needs
to
make
a
speech.
i
wish
to
refer
the
court
to
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
the
ed
clark
case,
a
recent
opinion
after
the
promulgation
of
the
carter-mondale
case,
where
nbc...
from
my
personal
knowledge...
was
put
in
the
position
where
a
third-party
candidate
for
the
libertarian
party
was
saying
i
want
25-minute
segments
and
nbc,
trying
to
comply
with
this
new
ruling
which
we
come
to
you
today
to
seek
to
get
reversed,
was
put
in
the
position
of
saying
we
think
5
five-minute
segments,
plus
a
series
of
shorter
segments,
30-second
segments,
et
cetera,
can
accomplish
your
stated
ends
of
greater
voter
identification
and
raising
money.
we
never
should
have
been
in
that
position;
the
commission
surely
should
never
have
been
put
in
the
position
of
judging
the
reasonableness,
and
in
that
case,
it
said
nbc
was
reasonable
in
saying
that
back
to
ed
clark.
that
imports
the
commission
into
the
political
process
in
a
way
it
has
never
been
before
and
we
think
that
it
raises
the
most
significant
constitutional
questions
as
well.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
little
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
just
one
moment,
your
honor.
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
if
i
may
that
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute
has
never
been
as
plain
to
the
commission
as
it
is
today.
they
have
issued
reports
in
1972,
1974,
a
primer
in
1978,
none
of
which
talked
about
this
being
a
candidate's
needs
statute.
this
matter
of
the
commission
determining
when
as
an
objective
matter
the
campaign
began
did
not
come
to
the
commission's
mind
until
its
second
opinion
in
this
case.
in
it's
very
first
opinion
they
purported
to
say
that
the
networks
had
acted
unreasonably
in
deciding
when
the
campaign
began.
it
was
not
until
page
124(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
where
the
commission,
in
its
second
opinion
on
rehearing,
says
in
so
many
words
that
its
determination
was
based
on
its
own
independent
evaluation
of
the
status
of
the
campaign.
mr.
shapiro
refers
to
title
i
and
its
purposes
and
i
can
do
no
more
than
to
refer
the
court
to
the
briefs
on
that.
title
i
of
the
statute
said,
in
so
many
words,
how
media
access
was
to
be
expanded,
it
did
not
include
and
the
commission's
opinion
says
this,
section
312(a)(7)
as
one
means
by
which
that
expansion
would
occur.
and
finally,
a
word
on
blanket
rule.
i
don't
even
understand
why
it
is
a
blanket
rule
for
abc
to
say
in
december
we
think
it's
appropriate
for
us
to
start
selling
time
in
january.
it
is
only
by
the
commission's
process
of
detaching
the
issue
of
when
from
factors
that
the
networks
may
consider
and
be
judged
on,
in
some
reasonable
way,
and
by
getting
that
out
of
the
equation
entirely,
that
it
makes
it
a
blanket
policy.
that
it's
only
that
that
makes
it
"unreasonable"
because
that's
not
a
subject
in
which
the
networks
have
anything
to
say
at
all
anymore.
mr.
floyd
abrams
well,
there's
a
claim,
mr.
justice
white,
and
there
was
a
claim
here
of
willful
misconduct--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
commission--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--the
carter-mondale
campaign
said
that
was
so--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--and
we
think--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--a
claim
was
made,
i
don't
think
the
commission
had
any
option
but
to
rule
on
it
at
the
time
and
in
the
way
that
they
did.
mr.
floyd
abrams
my
impression,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
must
say
it
is
that,
is
that
parties
have
come
to
characterize
their
claims
in
this
area
within
the
statutory
language
and
so
they
say,
at
least
when
they
file
complaints,
that
it
is
willful
or--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--in
terms
of
the
broadcasters,
i
mean
the
worst
thing
of
all
would
be
to
be
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
only
punishment
is
capital
punishment,
license
revocation,
and
the
first
time
it
comes
up
is
at
the
moment
that
your
license
is
up
for
consideration.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
certainly
trust
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
floyd
abrams
we
don't
believe
that
we
could
have
refrained,
under
the
public
interest
standard
as
it
exists,
from
making
any
use
time
available,
say,
in
this
presidential
campaign
or
in
this
presidential
primary--
mr.
floyd
abrams
--oh,
in
other
federal
races
like
that?
it...
this
would
be
a
different
situation
perhaps,
if
there
was
a
lower
federal
category
than
races
for
congress,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
and
it
has
always
been
our
understanding
that
the
public
interest
standard
would
not
have
permitted
a
flat
policy
on
behalf
of
a
broadcaster
of
declining
to
sell
time
totally
to
federal
candidates.
and
so
to
that
extent
as
well,
we
think
it
is
a
codification.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
