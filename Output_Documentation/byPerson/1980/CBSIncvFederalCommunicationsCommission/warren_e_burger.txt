chief
justice
warren
e.

we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
cbs
v.
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
related
cases.
mr.
abrams,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
abrams,
is
it
conceivable
that
over
a
period
there
would
be
a
number
of
complaints,
two,
three
or
four,
by
the
candidates
or
committees,
on
which
the
commission
would
give
no
relief
but
then
at
the
renewal
stage,
under
united
church
of
christ,
among
other
things,
examine
whether
there
was
a
pattern
of
favoring
one
kind
of
a
candidate,
or
one
candidate
or
one
party
and
take
that
into
account
in
the
renewal
proceedings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
entire
three-year
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens,
mr.
abrams,
as
a
practical
matter,
between
the
network
and
the
affiliated
stations?
if
the
networks
said,
yes,
we'll
give
you
the
hour
but
the
particular
station
said,
no,
we
won't
carry
it;
are
they
free
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
half
of
the
affiliates
declined
to
carry
it,
i
suppose
that
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
cost
of
the
time,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
some
time,
mr.
shapiro,
as
you
develop
this
discussion
of
the
new
obligation,
as
you
call
it,
would
you
suggest
hypothetically
what
would
be
the
situation
if
some
of
the
committees...
and
we
read
in
the
paper
that
there
are
activities
already
developing
right
in
washington
for
1984...
if
some
of
these
committees
made
requests
now
for
15
minutes
or
30
minutes,
for
may
or
july
of
this
year,
or
a
year
from
now...
in
other
words,
at
what
point
is
the
commission
authorized
to
say
when
the
campaign
begins?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
why
i
emphasized
hypothetically.
when
does
this
begin
after
he
is
a
qualified
candidate,
after
someone
is
a
qualified
candidate,
and
what
is
the
specific
source
of
authority
in
the
statute
for
the
commission
to
fix
that
date?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
the
economic
factors
a
natural
damper
on
these
early
requests?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
to
prevent
a
network
from
selling
time
next
week
to
a
1984
candidate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
has
$186,000
for
a
half
hour?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
initial
decision
is
the
network,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
is
the...
is
there
any
indication
of
what
is
the
scope
of
review
of
the
commission?
is
it
like
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
52
or
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
comes
to
the
commission
with
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
correctness,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
the
networks
would
be
entitled
to
take
into
account
in
the
total
equation,
what
congress
and
the
federal
election
law
and
other
ways
has
shown
a
concern
about
the
mounting
costs
of
campaigns
and
the
length
of
campaigns,
does
that
fit
into
the
equation
along
with
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
public...
there's
enough
public
interest,
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
doesn't
deal
with
these
problems
in
logic-tight
compartments,
does
it?
that
over
in
the
elections
law
they
are
saying
we
are
trying
to
shorten
campaigns
and
cut
the
costs
down,
but
even
in
this
other
area
then
totally
ignore
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you're
quarreling
with
the
court's
opinion
in
cbs
v.
democratic
national
committee.
that
was
only
45
seconds...
spots,
that
were
involved
in
that
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--would
you
agree
that
the
decision
on
the
part
of
the
network
could
be
erroneous,
but...
in
a
particular
case,
but
still
within
the
bounds
of
reasonableness?
or
are
they
mutually
exclusive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
you
get
the
"clearly
erroneous"
in
the
statute?
clearly,
now
you're
equating
it
something
to
rule
52(a).
where
do
you
get
the
clearly,
the
adjective?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
abrams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
presumably
if
they
moved
to
revoke
the
license,
there
would
be
a
hearing
process,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
