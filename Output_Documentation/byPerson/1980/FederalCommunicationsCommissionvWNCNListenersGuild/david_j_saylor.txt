mr.
david
j.
saylor
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
important
case
for
the
nation's
nearly
9,000
radio
stations
and
their
millions
of
avid
listeners.
the
decision
here
will
determine
whether
regulators
in
washington
over
their
own
strong
objections
must
intrude
into
the
workings
of
the
radio
entertainment
marketplace
in
countless
communities
across
the
country.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
i
think
the
case
does
have
bearing
on
television
as
well,
but
the
commission's
policy
statement
is
restricted
to
radio.
therefore,
i
believe
the
issue
before
the
court
today
strictly
relates
to
radio.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
this:
must
the
federal
communications
commission
in
ruling
on
radio
license
renewals
and
transfers
decide
whether
to
permit
a
radio
station
to
change
from
one
type
of
entertainment
programming
to
another.
or,
stated
a
different
way,
did
the
fcc
correctly
determine
in
the
proceedings
below
that
the
communications
act
of
1934,
read
in
light
of
the
first
amendment,
grants
the
commission
the
discretion
to
decline
to
review
changes
in
so-called
unique
entertainment
formats?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
sitting
en
banc
ruled
against
the
commission.
the
court
declared
that
the
commission
must
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
format
change
is
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
case
involves
proposed
changes
as
well
as
changes
that
may
have
taken
place
midterm
in
a
three-year
license
period.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes.
however,
according
to
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
a
challenge
to
the
midterm
change
in
format
would
not
come
until
the
time
for
renewal.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
that's
correct.
it's
the
same
standard,
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
the
commission's
view
in
this
situation,
both
renewals
and
transfers,
is
that
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
to
engage
in
regulation
of
unique
formats.
there's
a
somewhat
different
question
posed
when
it's
an
initial
licensing.
the
commission
has
considered
so-called
specialized
program
issues
in
comparative
cases
which
would
come
up
often
at
initial
licensing
time.
but
in
none
of
those
cases
has
the
commission
ever
considered
the
entertainment
programming
as
such
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
application
should
be
granted.
so
that
while
the
commission
did
not
address
itself
in
this
policy
statement
to
the
question
you
raise,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
the
commission's
policy
in
the
past
has
been
not
to
consider
entertainment
programming
in
making
decisions
regarding
initial
licensing.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission
would
not,
in
my
view,
consider
the
entertainment
programming
as
such.
the
commission
would,
however,
be
concerned
if
the
licensee
or
the
applicant
indicated
no
interest
in
programming
news
and
public
affairs,
so-called
non-entertainment
programming.
the
commission
has--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--the
commission
has
considered
the
quantity
of
non-entertainment
programming
proposed
by
an
applicant,
but
it
has
never
delved
into
the
quality
of
the
programming
and
has
not
made
value
judgments
regarding
whether
one
type
of
entertainment
programming
is
more
in
the
public
interest
than
another.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
no.
in
neither
instance
does
the
commission
consider
the
entertainment
programming
as
such.
the
non-entertainment
programming
such
as
news
and
public
affairs
programming
is
considered
but
in
a
very
general
sense.
the
commission
simply
wants
to
assure
itself
that
the
applicant
will
not
neglect
that
type
of
programming.
the
commission
inquires
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
broadcast
week,
or
the
broadcast
day,
will
be
devoted
to
news
and
other
informational
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
it
is
a
quantitative
consideration--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
news
and
other
informational
programming
makes
up
a
small,
relatively
small
portion
of
the
broadcast
day,
whereas
the
entertainment
programming
traditionally
consumes
the
balance
of
the
broadcast
day
and
it
is
there
that
the
commission
has
felt
that
the
congress
wanted
broadcasters
to
compete.
and
basically
that's
where
they
compete,
with
their
entertainment
program.
were
the
commission
to
regulate
entertainment
programming
it
would
reduce
the
licensee
discretion
in
that
very
large
portion
of
the
broadcast
day
and
raise
in
the
commission's
view
serious
first
amendment
considerations.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission
has
a
guideline
in
the
form
of
a
delegation
of
authority
to
the
staff
of
the
broadcast
bureau.
if
the
applicant
proposes
a
percentage
of
broadcast
hour
above
a
certain
number
for
commercial
programming,
the
commission
would
consider
that
and
if
there
is
not
an
adequate
explanation
from
the
licensee,
the
commission
might
well
put
that
matter
into
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
licensee
is
proposing
an
excessive
amount
of
commercial
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
well,
i
guess
historically
the
congress
has
expressed
some
interest
in
the
amount
of
commercials
on
broadcast
programming
and
the
commission
has
felt
that
perhaps
some
supervision
is
appropriate
in
order
to
insure
that
licensees
don't
vastly
exceed
what
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
however,
the
commission
is
presently
reconsidering
that.
it
has
reached
the
tentative
conclusion
that
the
marketplace
is
sufficiently
competitive
so
that
broadcasters
are
most
unlikely
to
engage
in
excessive
commercialization.
but
i
can't
say
at
this
point,
of
course,
that
the
commission
has
gotten
rid
of
those
regulations
entirely,
but
they
are
processing
guidelines
and
they
are
quantitative
rather
than
qualitative
and
they
relate
to
a
smaller
portion
of
the
broadcast
day
than
entertainment
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
failure
to
have
any
news
or
public
affairs
programming
of
any
sort
would
be
a
matter
of
interest
and
concern
to
the
commission,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
sports
as
opposed
to
something
else
that
was
occupying
most
of
the
broadcast
day,
that
would
not
be
a
matter
which
the
commission
would
feel
it's
competent
to
evaluate.
the
commission
does
not
believe
that
it
has
the
capacity
to
determine
whether
sports
programming
is
more
in
the
interest
of
the
public
than
a
particular
type
of
musical
programming.
and
most
of
these
cases,
of
course,
have
come
up
in
the
context
of
one
type
of
musical
programming
versus
another.
and
especially
in
that
instance
the
commission
doubts
that
it
has
the
capacity,
the
wherewithal
to
ascertain
what
the
public
really
wants,
the
intensity
of
preference
on
the
part
of
the
public,
and
whether
one
group
which
prefers
one
type
of
format
outnumbers
another
group,
and
whether
or
not
the
group
which
outnumbers
would
in
fact
listen
to
the
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
do
not
need
to
decide
the
difference
between
them
but
i
do
think
that
you
have
to
wrestle
with
the
same
problem
the
commission
has
in
determining
how
the
commission
in
a
given
case
would
be
able
to
distinguish
between
different
kinds
of
music
in
order
to
judge
whether
or
not
a
type
of
music
is
being
abandoned
and
there
are
no
reasonable
or
adequate
substitutes
elsewhere
in
the
marketplace.
that
is
a
very
difficult,
subjective,
almost
an
esthetic
value
judgment
which
in
most
cases,
administrative
law
judges,
commissioners,
and
justices
of
this
court
simply
can't
have
the
knowledge
to
draw
the
distinctions,
and
even
if,
as
happened
before
the
administrative
law
judge
in
the
wefm
case,
even
if
an
expert
is
brought
in,
a
musicologist,
the
other
side
can
just
as
easily
bring
in
a
musicologist
on
the
other
side.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
mr.
justice
white,
there
certainly
are
some
instances
where
the
commission
would
not
have
any
difficulty
determining
that
a
change
had
taken
place.
certainly
the
difference
between
classical
music
and
country
and
western
is
clear.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
that's
part
of
the
test
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
must
hold
a
hearing
if
the
format--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--well,
they
felt
that
there
were
not
that
many
protests
and
that
there
really
wouldn't
be
a
need
for
a
hearing
in
very
many
instances.
but--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--no,
they
did
not.
they
said
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
if
four
threshold
requirements
are
met.
first,
the
format
must
be
arguably
unique;
secondly,
there
must
be
significant
public
grumbling
by
those
loyal
to
that
particular
format;
third,
the
format
must
be
one
which
could
be...
the
adherents
of
that
format
must
be
sufficiently
numerous
so
that
one
could
say
there
are
enough
frequencies
available
in
the
community
so
that
in
a
technological
sense
their
preference
could
be
satisfied.
and
fourth,
the
point
that
you
were
raising
a
moment
ago,
there
must
either
be
substantial
material
question
about
the
financial
viability
of
the
format
or
as
to
whether
or
not
that
format
could
arguably
become
financially
viable.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission's
basic
position
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
requires
this
type
of
inquiry.
the
second
point
of
my
argument
today
is
that
the
commission's
judgment
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
in
the
public
interest
was
a
reasonable
judgment.
and
third,
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
to
this
matter
raises
serious
first
amendment
reservations.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission
has
always
had
this
position.
there
was
a
period
subsequent
to
the
voice
of
atlanta
case
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1970
where
the
commission
was
trying
to
determine
how
it
could
satisfy
the--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes:
that
it's
a
matter
for
the
licensee
to
decide
what
type
of
entertainment
programming
is
most
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
he
might
be
subject
to
those
complaints
but--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--not
on
entertainment
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes.
there
have
been
licenses
taken
away
for
violations
of
the
fairness
doctrine,
which
is
in
a
sense
a
content-related
concept.
i
believe
licenses...
a
few,
at
least,
have
been
taken
away,
or
applications
denied,
for
a
failure
to
indicate
any
desire
to
program
news
and
public
affairs;
information,
not
entertainment.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission's
position
is
that
the
licensee
does
have
discretion
to
change
midterm
from
what
the
licensee
proposed
at
the
outset
of
the
license
term.
however,
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
licensee
never
intended
to
fulfill
that
proposal--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--i
think
not.
i
think
the
commission
would
take
a
look
at
that
to
determine
why
the
licensee
thought
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
program--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--i
think
the
commission
would
have
the
authority
under
the
statute
to
deny
the
transfer
or
to
deny
renewal,
but
the
inquiry--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--i
think
it
is.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
inquiry
in
that
case
would,
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
correctly,
the
inquiry
would
be
into
the
quantity
of
news
and
other
non-entertainment
programming.
the
licensee
would
have
changed
to
zero
percent
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
agree
with
your
characterization
of
the
public
interest
standard.
the
commission
years
ago
indicated
that
diversity
was
an
important
aspect
of
the
public
interest.
but
in
this
context
the
commission
concluded
that
there
are
two
types
of
diversity
of
ideas.
there
is
diversity
between
broad
format
categories
and
in
addition
there
is
diversity
within
a
format
category.
there
are
perhaps
over
a
hundred
different
types
of
middle-of-the-road
programming.
middle-of-the-road
is
a
classification.
there
are,
as
i
think
was
implicit
in
justice
marshall's
question,
many
different
types
of
rock
music.
the
commission
felt
that
there
are
two
different
types
of
diversity
and
the
commission
is
not
in
a
position
to
choose
between
one
and
the
other.
listeners
do
indeed
identify
substantial
differences
within
a
given
format
category.
in
addition
there
are
other
public
interest
considerations,
other
considerations
which
fall
into
this
rubric
of
the
public
interest.
one
is
the
idea
that
the
licensee
should
have
wide
discretion.
this
court
has
indicated
as
much,
its
approval
of
that
concept,
in
several
decisions
recently,
including
the
midwest
video
ii
case,
and
the
case
of
cbs
v.
democratic
national
committee.
in
addition,
the
concept
of
how
to
balance
and
accommodate
these
different
interests
is
one
which
this
court
has
said
is
appropriately
a
matter
for
commission
discretion.
here
the
commission
concluded
that
it
simply
lacked
the
capacity
to
decide
what
is
most
in
the
public
interest
in
the
case
of
two
different
competing
types
of
entertainment
programming.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
only
insofar
as
under
the
current
guidelines
the
licensee
would
be
neglecting
news
and
informational
programming
entirely.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
perhaps,
but
it
depends
upon
the
licensee's
explanation.
if
the
commission
concludes
that
the
licensee
has
done
it
in
good
faith
and
believes
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest,
then
the
commission
would
not
prevent
renewal.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
absolutely.
furthermore,
there
is
nothing...
as
i
said
earlier,
that's...
on
the
face
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history
or
anything
that's
implicit
in
the
statute
that
would
indicate
the
approach
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
mandatory.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
i
think
that,
if...
by
different
things
you
mean
the
amount
of
entertainment
programming
or
the
quality
of
the
entertainment
programming?
mr.
david
j.
saylor
i
don't
think
there's--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--the
first
amendment
argument
really
relates
to...
it
is
not
that
the
first
amendment...
except
in
the
area
of
chilling
experimentation
the
commission
did
not
conclude
that
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
bar.
they
did
believe
that
the
impact
upon
experimentation,
on
licensees
who
would
want
to
try
unique
format,
would
be
adverse,
counterproductive
even
to
the
objective
of
the
court
of
appeals.
so
in
that
area
the
commission
viewed
the
situation
as
creating
an
impermissible
chilling
effect.
but
otherwise,
i
think
the
commission's
concern
was
with
the
values
of
the
first
amendment.
the
greater
the
degree
of
commission
intrusion,
the
greater
the
portion
of
the
broadcast
day
which
is
affected,
the
greater
the
amount
to
which
the
commission
is
entangled
in
making
value
judgments
about
programming,
the
more
the
first
amendment
is
implicated.
it
is
a
balancing
of
different
values,
and
certainly
in
this
case
involving
entertainment
programming
the
commission
felt
that
the
balance
tipped
very
much
in
favor
of
leaving
the
judgment
to
licensee
discretion.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission
has
never
indicated
that
entertainment
programming
would
be
decisionally
significant
in
a
comparative
case.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
no.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
well,
it
does
ask
what
programming--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--what
programming
is
proposed,
but
it's
a
very
general
question,
and
one,
i
believe,
if
the
commission
is
affirmed
in
this
case,
it
would
probably
eliminate
that
question
from
its--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--why
would?
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission
has
gathered
the
information
for
years,
i
would
say
more
for
statistical
purposes
than
anything
else,
but
the
publicly
available
sources
are
sufficient
to
provide
that
information
so
i
think
the
commission
might
well
reconsider
even
asking
for
that
information.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
entertainment
programming
has
never
been
and
would
not
be
in
the
future.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
my
time,
if
i
may,
with
the
permission
of
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
i
have
several
brief
points
to
make
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
i
believe
ms.
glen
characterized
this
case
as
one
involving
procedures.
that's
directly
contrary
to
the
way
we
view
this
case.
this
is
a
case
of
substance.
the
commission
engaged
in
substantive
rulemaking
or
policy
making
in
an
attempt
to
determine
what
the
public
interest
standard
in
the
statute
requires;
a
question
of
substance.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
the
commission's
view
as
expressed
in
its
policy
statement
is
that
the
statute
does
not
require
regulation,
but
the
position
we've
taken
in
our
brief,
and
the
position
the
commission
took
in
its
policy
statement,
was
that
while
there
are
statements
of
the
congress
regarding
the
issue
in
the
course
of
hearings,
there
then
is
no
need
to
reach
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
would
bar
the
commission
from
engaging
in
the
type
of
regulation
the
court
of
appeals
imposed.
in
other
words--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--we
think
it's
a
difficult
statutory
question
but
we
don't
think
this
court
is
required
to
decide
that
issue,
if
you
are
inclined
to
rule
our
way.
this
is
a
case
of
discretion
and
the
commission
has
interpreted
the
public
interest
standard
in
a
way
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
well,
i
don't
think
the
policy
statement
is
addressed
to
that
type
of
a
question.
there
is
a
very
difficult--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--yes.
i
can't
conceive
of
the
marketplace
ever
working
in
that
way
so
that
someone
wanted
to
waste
his
money.
but
if
it
should
happen,
i
think
perhaps
the
correct
answer
is,
is
the
commission
would
allow
the
licensee
to
retain
that
license.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
i
can
conceive
of
people
having
that
inclination
but
it's
an
expensive
proposition
and
i
think
most
unlikely.
if
there
is
a
frequency
being
wasted
in
that
way,
i
am
sure
someone
will
come
in
and
offer
to
pay
a
very
substantial
amount
of
money
to
obtain
that
license,
and
i
doubt
that
that--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--i
would.
i
believe
the
commission
would
allow
the
marketplace
to
function.
as
i
said
earlier,
this
is
a
case
involving
the
meaning
of
the
public
interest
standard.
this
is
much
like
the
newspaper-broadcast
cross-ownership
case
where
the
commission
was
attempting
to
determine
what
the
public
interest
requires.
there
there
was
a
conflict,
or
arguable
conflict,
between
diversification
in
ownership
which
is
calculated
to
lead
to
diversity
of
ideas
on
the
one
hand,
versus
the
concept
of
best
practicable
service
and
the
concept
of
local
ownership,
and
how
desirable
local
ownership
was.
the
commission
concluded
that
despite
these
cross-ownership
situations
most
of
them
should
be
grandfathered,
because
to
push
the
goal
of
diversity
too
far
would
undercut
some
of
the
other
statutory
objectives
inherent
in
the
public
interest
standard.
we
view
this
case
in
much
the
same
way.
however,
here
there
is
an
additional
twist,
and
that
is,
even
pursuing
diversity,
the
commission
reached
the
view
that
there
are
two
types
of
diversity
competing
here:
diversity
between
format
types
and
diversity
within
format
types.
the
commission
simply
does
not
have
the
capacity
and
thinks
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
attempt
to
choose
between
one
type
of
diversity
and
another.
we
think,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
make
that
choice
and
in
doing
so
acted
in
contravention
of
a
standard
that
this
court
long
ago
announced
in
the
case
of
nbc
v.
united
states,
but
it
is
not
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
whether
the
public
interest
will
be
furthered
or
retarded;
that's
the
commission's
job.
i
have
one
other
quick
point
to
make
that,
with
respect
to
spanish
language
programming,
the
commission's
view
is
that
the
entertainment
elements
of
that
programming
are
subject
to
this
policy
statement
but
that
the
informational
programming
and
the
licensee's,
or
the
applicant's
responsibility
to
ascertain
the
problems,
needs,
and
interests
of
the
community
and
to
respond
to
that
with
informational
programming
is
something
different,
which
the
commission
didn't
face
in
this
policy
statement
and
the
court
need
not
decide.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes.
that,
now,
was--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--yes.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
it
was
after
that
case.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
it
was
adopted
under
the
pressure
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
atlanta
case
and
the
progressive
rock
case,
and
another
case
which
has
been
cited
in
the--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--absolutely.
and
that
has
been
the
commission's
position
throughout,
but
the
court
and
the
commission...
the
commission
was
attempting
to
in
some
way
comply
with
the
court's
mandate.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
it's
an
aberration.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
that
is
the
same--
mr.
david
j.
saylor
--that
was
in
the
zenith
case.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
that
was
the
concurring
statement,
concurred
in
by
six
commissioners
in
wefm.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
well,
one
has
to
view
it
in
that
context.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
not
precisely.
but
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
commission
had
never
changed
its
mind
on
the
basic
proposition
that
it's
a
matter
of
licensee
discretion.
mr.
david
j.
saylor
yes.
thank
you.
