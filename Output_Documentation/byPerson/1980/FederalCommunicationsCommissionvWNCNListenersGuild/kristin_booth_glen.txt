ms.
kristin
booth
glen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
kristin
booth
glen.
i
represent
the
wncn
listeners
guild,
which
was
one
of
the
petitioners
in
the
three
cases
below.
i'll
be
speaking
for
all
the
respondents
today,
except
that
ms.
wilhemina
cooke,
my
co-counsel,
will
be
speaking
for
the
last
ten
minutes
on
the
specific
issue
of
foreign
language
formats,
which
is
perhaps
the
starkest
example
of
what
we
have
in
front
of
us
today.
i'd
like
to
speak
generally
about
the
issues
that
i
think
the
court
has
been
exploring
with
mr.
dyk
and
mr.
saylor,
but
suggest
that
if
there
is
time
i
hope
to
save
a
few
moments
at
the
end
to
raise
with
you
an
independent
ground
upon
which
the
commission's
policy
statement
here
can
be
set
aside.
and
that
is,
it's
blatant
and
flagrant
violation
of
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
we
have
argued
at
some
length,
so
poisoned
this
record
that
the
policy
statement
simply
may
not
stand,
even
under
your
rulings
in
vermont
yankee.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
excuse
me,
your
honor?
section
553,
the
notice
and
comment
requirement.
i
could
speak
to
that
now
if
you
wish
but
i
think
perhaps--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--i
hear
from
the
questions
that
the
court
has
been
asking
a
great
deal
of
concern
with
what
i
think
has
troubled
us
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
the
commission
itself
in
over
ten
years
of
listening
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
counsel
for
the
commission
and
for
the
private
parties
today,
have
repeatedly
mischaracterized
what
the
d.c.
circuit
has
been
doing
as
some
intrusion
into
policy,
as
some
rewriting
of
the
public
interest
standard,
as
some
requirement
that
the
commission
or
the
government
range
freely
among
broadcasters,
telling
them
what
to
play,
telling
them
what
not
to
play.
and
nothing,
in
fact,
as
i
think
the
very
restrained
opinion
of
the
d.c.
circuit
below
says,
is
farther
from
the
truth.
this
is
really
quite
a
simple
case.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
is
disagreement
on
what
the
public
interest
requires
in
terms
of
diversity.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
d.c.
circuit
is
substituting
its
policy
judgment.
this
is
a
case
actually
unlike
most
of
the
communications
cases
that
you
hear.
this
is
simply
about
procedure,
about
the
requirement
that
a
regulatory
agency
follow
the
procedure
that
the
statute
which
congress
has
passed
requires
it
to
do.
and--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
they
certainly
don't,
your
honor,
but
certainly
it
is
a
premise
of
the
separation
of
powers
in
this
country,
that
a
court's
construction
of
the
statute
is
ultimately
binding.
now,
obviously
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
construe
this
statute
differently
than
the
court
of
appeals
did,
but
the
court's
construction
of
the
statute
itself,
which
is
not
a
policy
issue
here,
is
binding
on
the
agency.
and
it
is
in
fact
this
construction
which
is
quite
clear
and
which
i
think
quite
clearly
comes
from
the
statute
that
the
commission
has
for
reason
of
its
own...
and
i'll
speak
to
that,
i
think...
repeatedly
refused
to
follow
this
statute.
now--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--your
honor,
not
just
as
construed
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
i
think
that--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--not
even
by
me,
your
honor.
i
think
actually
as
construed
by
this
court
as
early
back
as
the
case
of
ashbacker
radio.
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
scheme,
particularly
sections
309
and
310,
you
notice
that,
what
again
i
think
you
meant
at
the
argument
here,
what
congress
did
was
set
up
a
comprehensive
licensing
scheme
to
deal
with
the
electromagnetic
spectrum.
and
what
it
also
did
was
say
that
we
will
choose
among
various
applicants
if
there
are
choices;
if
there
are
none,
we
will
look
at
the
applicant
who
comes
in
to
decide
who
will
best
serve
the
public
interest
convenience
and
necessity.
and
we
will
do
that
in
three-year
blocks.
we
will
give
licenses
for
three
years.
there
is
no
property
right
in
those
licenses.
the
statute
says,
in
three
separate
sections,
that
there
is
no
right
beyond
the
three-year
period.
and,
in
fact,
the
whole
congressional
scheme
is
that
in
this
renewal
decision
which
the
commission
must
make,
the
channels
which
are
allocated
are
always
free
to
be
reallocated
if
someone
else
can
better
serve
the
public.
and
as
justice
burger...
then
judge
burger,
said
in
the
d.
c.
circuit,
"licensees
run
on
their
record".
that's
what
they
do.
the
way
we
choose
licensees
is
by
their
service.
in
the
end
that's
it,
and
service
is
programming.
so
this
is
clearly
within
the
statute,
and
has
always
been
involved
in
the
commission's
determinations.
and
i
will
in
a
moment,
if
you
will
bear
with
me,
go
down
a
whole
series
of
areas
in
which
the
commission
looks
into
this
kind
of
programming
in
terms
of
judging
service,
both
for
initial
applicants,
for
renewal
applicants,
for
competing
applicants,
for
waivers
of
allocation
policy,
and
so
forth.
but
the
statute
itself,
i
think,
really
requires
some
care.
section
309(a)
states...
and
it
is
the
mandatory
quality
of
the
statute,
i
think,
that
the
d.
c.
circuit
is
dealing
with,
again
and
again,
and
which
takes
us
away
from
the
commission's
decision
that
it
is
its
policy
not
to
make
judgments...
309(a)
says
that
in
each
application
the
commission
"shall
determine
whether
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
would
be
served
by
granting."
section
309(d)(1)
provides...
and
this
is
different
from
many
regulatory
statutes,
but
it
is
special
here
because
of
the
special
nature
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum,
that
any
party
in
interest
may
file
with
the
commission
if
it
believes
that
the
public
interest
will
not
be
served.
and
in
the
seminal
case
of
the
united
church
of
christ
that
justice
burger
decided
in
1966,
the
public
was
given
standing
to
raise
precisely
those
issues,
because
it
is
the
public,
that
decision
said,
who
is
best
in
a
position
to
talk
about
the
service
that
the
licensee
has
rendered
or
will
render.
they
know
it
the
most,
they
care
the
most,
and
therefore
they
are
appropriate
parties.
finally...
and
i
might
add,
that
the
transfer
situation
is
governed
by
310
but
the
standards
are
exactly
the
same
and
the
language,
the
commission
"must"
or
"shall",
is
equally
there.
finally,
section
309(d)(2)
provides
that
if
a
substantial
and
material
question
of
fact
is
presented
or
if
the
commission
for
any
reason
is
unable
to
find
that
the
grant
of
the
application...
and
again
this
would
be
either
the
initial
application,
the
renewal,
or
the
transfer...
would
be
consistent
with
subsection
(a):
it
shall
provide
as
proceeded;
if
not
it
must
hold
a
hearing.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
statutory
scheme
which
says,
every
time
an
application
is
made,
whether
it
is
an
application
to
be
the
first
broadcaster
on
a
frequency;
to
renew
your
license;
an
application
by
a
competing
applicant
who
comes
in
at
a
renewal
period
and
says,
i
can
do
it
better;
or
when
an
existing
licensee
wishes
to
transfer
his
license;
the
commission
must
make
the
public
interest
determination.
now,
there
has
never
been
any
question
until
this
proceeding...
and
in
fact
i
believe
that
there
is
not
even
any
question
in
this
proceeding...
that
that
public
interest
determination
includes
diversity.
the
diversity
standard
of
the
public
interest
standard
is
not
free-wheeling;
it
comes
from
the
act.
the
act
begins,
that
"the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
provide
service
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states."
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
of
course,
your,
honor.
and
in
fact
the
commission--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--no.
your
honor,
i
think,
actually,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
something
that
was
said
before.
with
regard,
for
example,
to
initial
applicants,
the
form--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--it
doesn't,
your
honor,
except
that--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--right.
except
that
in
every
situation
other
than
the
situation
raised
in
this
policy
statement,
that
is
to
say,
when
citizens
come
in
and
say,
this
proposed
abandonment
or
this
actual
abandonment
of
a
unique
format
has
decreased
diversity.
in
every
other
situation
where
diversity
is
at
issue,
the
commission
looks
from,
starting
from
the
application
for
an
initial
license
where
contrary
to
counsel's
position,
on
the
radio
license
form
301,
and
it's
in
footnote
7
of
our
brief,
the
citation,
the
question
is
asked,
what
programming
do
you
propose
and
how
does
it
contribute
to
overall
diversity?
they
don't
ask
that
on
television
licenses,
and
i
think
that
that's
a
clear
choice,
understanding
that
there's
a
conscious
choice,
to
look
for
diversity
within
a
service
area
when
making
choices
among
either
new
applicants
or
competing
applicants.
now,
when
an
applicant
for
a
station
or
a
competing
applicant
comes
in
and
says,
i
propose
a
new
format,
a
specialized
format,
a
unique
format,
whether
that
is
classical
music
in
a
market
with
ten
rock
stations
or
whether
it
is
spanish
language
in
a
mixed
market
or
whatever,
the
commission's
own
statement,
its
own
policy
statement,
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
september
of
this
year,
says
that
that
applicant
gets
a
comparative
plus,
a
merit,
in
the
determination
as
to
whether
he
or
she
will
best
serve
the
public
interest
and
get
the
license.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
what
the
most
recent
case
says,
it's
the
case
called
cameron,
which
again
is
cited
in
our
brief,
it
says
that
the
comparative
merit
will
be
given
only
to
a
licensee
who
proposes
a
unique
format,
and
that
is
a
unique
format,
obviously,
in
the
service
area.
so
if
there
are
already
four
spanish
language
stations,
he
gets
nothing.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
but
if
it
is
the
first
classical
music
station,
he
does.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
your
honor,
the
question
of
uniqueness
or
of
contribution
to
diversity
is
never
necessarily
controlling.
it
is
simply
a
public
interest
aspect
which
the
commission
takes
into
account.
it
may
be
counterbalanced
by
some
other
aspect,
there
may
be
another
format
that
many
people
wish
to
hear,
there
may
be
other
reasons,
there
may
be
minority
ownership...
and
that's
something
that
the
commission
is
interested
in...
it
need
not
be
dispositive,
and
clearly
if
there
is
no
need
for
it
in
the
service
area,
the
plus
which
it
may
get
may
not
be
enough
to
outweigh
the
programming
proposals
of
the
other
applicant
or
prospective
licensee.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
it's
also
pretty
unlikely
that
anybody
would
propose
it
in
montana...
exactly.
but
it
is
an
aspect
of
the
public
interest,
and
it
is
an
aspect
which
the
commission
looks
at
all
the
time.
right
here
in
washington,
even
as
we
speak,
the
commission
has
said,
in
a
competing
application
for
wook-fm,
because
of
the
loss
of
a
spanish
language
format
and
that
whole
complicated
situation,
leaving
300,000
people
in
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
without
spanish
language
programming,
that
one
of
the
competing
applicants,
a
hispanic,
has
proposed
a
spanish
language
programming
format
in
its
application.
in
the
event
a
threshold
showing
is
made
to
the
administrative
law
judge
that
hispanic's
proposed
format
is
specialized
and
unique,
an
inquiry
into
the
need
for
that
format
may
be
considered
under
the
standard
comparative
issue.
so
in
fact
there
you
have
the
commission
itself
saying,
when
a
broadcaster
comes
in
and
says,
i
propose
to
increase
diversity
and
to
serve
a
portion
of
the
community
that
has
not
been
served,
they'll
look
at
it.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
because
they
say
it
in
every
situation
except
the
single
situation
which
is
before
you
here
and
which
was
before
the
commission
in
the
policy
statement.
and
that
is,
where
the
question
is
not
an
increase
in
diversity
because
a
broadcaster
is
proposing
a
unique
format
or
increasing
diversity
by
some
specialized
program,
but
where
listeners,
where
the
very
public
who
were
let
into
these
proceedings
in
1966
by
the
ucc
case
says,
this
proposed
abandonment
of
a
unique
format
will
decrease
diversity.
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
said,
it
must
be
treated
the
same
way.
certainly
the
policy
considerations,
the
difficulties
that
the
commission
and
the
private
parties
speak
of
in
terms
of
making
these
determinations
are
exactly
the
same.
and
yet
the
commission
has
said,
in
this
instance
where
it's
the
public
who
raises
it,
where
we're
talking
about
the
decrease,
we
will
not
look.
and
it
is
that
"we
will
not
look"
that
the
commission
has
said
finally
and
clearly
in
its
policy
statement,
although
it
had
previously
had
at
least
a
generalized
statement
that
it
would
take
hard
looks
in
hard
cases
and
if
a
unique
format
was
really
abandoned
it
would
take
a
hard
look.
in
this
policy
statement,
no
date
at
the
end
of
the
statement,
it
said,
we
have
decided
that
we
will
not
look.
in
other
words,
we
will
not
make
the
public
interest
determination
that
the
statute
mandates.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
the
commission
always
took
a
position
that
licensee
discretion
in
general
and
that
the
marketplace
did
best
in
terms
of
allocating
its
own
formats.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
no,
your
honor.
earlier...
well,
the
decision
that
was
reviewed
in
wefm,
which
was
the
first
en
banc
format
case
in
the
d.
c.
circuit,
in
fact
had
appended
to
it
a
policy
statement
that
commissioner
burch...
that
commissioner
burch
wrote
and
that
other
commissioners
joined
in,
in
which
he
said...
and
this
is
what's
very
interesting,
because
there
is
no
disagreement
here
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
policy
statement,
that,
in
general
we
think
that
the
marketplace
works
very
well.
in
general
we
think
that
the
marketplace
maximizes
diversity.
we
think
that
these
choices
should
be
made
by
licensees,
and
that's
the
best
thing.
but
where...
and
it's
quoted
in
our
brief...
that
where
a
unique
format
is
going
to
be
abandoned,
where
there
will
truly
be
a
loss
of
diversity,
we
will
take
a
hard
look
and
consider
that.
now,
that
i
consider
to
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
standard.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
it
was
a
majority.
i
think
it
was
six
out
of
seven
of
the
commissioners
who
issued
that
statement
and
they
did
so
particularly
because,
although
there
was
a
specific
adjudicatory
situation,
they
said,
we
want
you
to
know
what
we're
talking
about.
and
what
we're
talking
about
is
in
general
letting
the
marketplace
do
it,
but
a
hard
look,
the
safety
valve,
the
kind
of
things
discussed
in--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--in
wefm
itself;
exactly.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
the
difference
in
that
case,
that
was
an
adjudication,
and
they
did
not
look,
and
they
said,
we
don't
find
that
there
is
an
issue
of
fact.
and
in
fact,
two
out
of
three
judges
of
the
original
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
heard
it
said,
right,
there's
no
question
of
fact.
and
it
was
the
en
banc--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
they
specifically
say
in
the
appendix
at
134a,
it's
footnote
8,
to
their
decision,
to
the
policy
statement
that
is
in
review
here.
and
it
reads
as
follows:
"the
commission
has
indicated
that
it
would
take
an
extra
hard
look
at
the
reasonableness
of
any
proposal
that
would
deprive
a
community
of
its
only
source
of
a
particular
type
of
programming."
and
then
it
cites
the
zenith
radio
corp.,
which
was
in
fact
the
wefm
case
at
the
commission.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
it
only
comes
up,
really,
if
the
public
raises
a
fuss,
although
i
think
that
the
obligation
to
look
is
always
on
the
commission.
but
i
think
that
the
case
below
here
says
that
you
have
to
have
public
grumbling.
but
the
commission
continues
here,
having
just
stated
that
it
will
give
a
hard
look
where
a
unique
service
is
going
to
be
taken
away,
"having
given
the
entire
matter
further
study,
however,
we
have
concluded
that
such
a
position
is
neither
administratively
tenable
nor
necessarily
in
the
public
interest."
"rather,
as
discussed
herein,
we
believe
that
the
market
is
the
allocation
mechanism
of
preference
for
entertainment
formats
and
that
commission
supervision
in
this
area
will
not
be
conducive
either
to
producing
diversity
or
satisfied
listeners."
in
other
words,
we
will
not
look.
and
it
is
the
"we
will
not
look"
which
is
the
abdication
of
the
statutory
responsibility.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
no,
your
honor,
this
is
a
policy
statement.
and
in
fact,
the
very
interesting
thing
about
this--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--your
honor,
the
commission
itself
throughout
both
the
notice
of
inquiry--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
perhaps
i
can
relate
it
back.
in
all
of
these
documents,
the
commission
itself
says--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--no,
your
honor,
but
what
they
have
said
is,
they
will
never
give
us
a
hearing
again.
we
can
walk
in
and
say,
there
are
300,000
hispanics
in
this
city,
there
are
40
radio
stations.
the
hispanic
station
is
now
changing
to
a
format
which
is
duplicated
by
several
other
stations.
this
is
a
terrible
loss,
both
to
diversity
and
to
the
service
of
a
minority
community
which
is
part
of
the
undivided
ownership
and
the
commission--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--your
honor,
we
can
say
this
format
is
making
money,
this
format
is
necessary,
this
format
will
create
a
terrible
loss,
and
the
commission
has
said
in
the
policy
statement
which
you
are
reviewing
here
and
which
the
d.
c.
circuit
has
struck
down,
we
will
not
look.
the
commission
has
said,
throughout
this
proceeding,
we
recognize
that
there
are
marketplace
failures.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
but
your
honor,
in
saying
they
will
not
look
they
are
saying
that
they
will
not
make
the
statutory
public
interest
determination
that
309
and
310
require
them
to
make.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
in
this
policy
review?
no,
if
they
said,
we
will
look,
we
will
follow
the
statute,
we
will
follow
the
law
as
the
d.
c.
circuit
has
explicated
it,
we
will
do
in
a
situation
where
listeners
raise
this
question.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
in
this
policy
statement?
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
be
here.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
i
would
not
be
here.
it's
somewhat
peculiar
that
these
cases
didn't
come
up
in
adjudicatory
situations.
there
were
four
of
them,
as
you
know,
and
the
commission
had
actually
prepared
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
wefm,
and
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself,
decided
not
to
appeal
that
specific
factual
case
to
this
court.
so
all
we
have
is
the
policy
statement
here.
but
it
is,
i
think,
that
the
policy
statement
places
in
very
stark
terms
the
commission's
statement
that
it
will
not
follow
the
statute,
that
it
is
abdicating
its
statutory
responsibility--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
your
honor,
the
commission
has
said,
we
will
not
make
this
public
interest
determination.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
and
i
think
that
this
is--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--i'm
not
even
sure
that
the
commission
said
that.
the
commission
said,
if
our--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--no,
but
it
said,
in
our
judgment
it's
best
to
let
the
marketplace
make
the
determination
across
the
board.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
but,
it's
pretty
clear,
i
think,
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
far
back
as
ashbacker
radio,
that
when
the
statute
requires
a
procedure,
when
the
statute
requires
a
hearing
between
competing
applicants,
as
was
the
case
in
ashbacker,
or
as
here
where
material
and
substantial
questions
going
to
the
public
interest
are
raised,
that
the
fact
that
the
commission,
even
given
its
expertise
and
whatever,
thinks
than
another
procedure
might
be
better,
is
simply
not
permissible.
that
is
in
a
sense
what
happened
in
ucc.
the
commission
said,
we
don't
have
to
let
these
people
in,
we
don't
have
to
give
them
standing,
and
we're
not
going
to
hold
a
hearing.
justice
burger
said,
this
is
a
procedural
case.
in
ashbacker
the
commission
said,
we
think
it
would
be
better
to
just
grant
this
application
and
put
the
competing
application
to
the
side
and
hold
a
hearing
later,
because
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
get
somebody
on
the
air.
and
this
court
said,
no.
the
statute
says,
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing.
and
the
fact
that
you
think
that
there's
a
better
procedure
is
not
within
your
power.
if
you
think
there's
a
better
procedure,
go
to
congress.
and
in
fact,
the
commission
has
gone
to
congress
every
year,
and
they're
there
again
this
year
as
are
many
other
members
of
the
private
broadcast
industry
saying,
don't
make
us
do
this,
don't
make
us
regulate.
but
we
have
a
statutory
scheme
right
now,
and
the
statutory
scheme
says
that
they
do
have
to
regulate,
that
there
do
have
to
be
choices
made
about
who
will
use
this
scarce
resource.
and,
for
better
or
worse,
that
choice
is
on
the
commission
and
at
least
the
commission
is
in
some
senses
democratically
responsible.
for
them
to
say,
the
marketplace
will
make
the
choice,
we
won't
look,
is
to
put
the
power
to
decide
what
shall
be
heard
and
who
will
be
served
not
in
people
who
are
responsible
to
the
president
and
the
congress
but
to
people
with
marketplace
forces.
and
that
is
precisely
the
scheme
that
the
congress
eschewed
by
developing
a
licensing
system
in
the
first
place.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
your
honor,
the
commission
must
make
in
cases
in
this
court,
from
as
far
back
as
pottsville,
through
nbc
and
rko,
to
discussion
in
the
national
citizens
communications
for
broadcasting
case,
about
the
broad
rule
that
the
d.
c.
circuit
would
have
imposed
in
terms
of
cross-ownership.
talk
about
the
commission's,
the
requirement
that
the
commission
make
an
individualized
determination,
and
to
say,
we're
not
going
to
make
determinations,
we're
not
going
to
look,
we're
just
going
to
let
the
marketplace
do
it,
is
to
say
we
will
not
make
that
individualized
determination.
and
i
think
that
that's
really
related
to
the
right
that
the
statute
creates
for
a
hearing.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
but
if
the
marketplace
were
to
be
allowed
to
make
these
decisions,
then
you
wouldn't
have
comparative
renewal
hearings,
you
wouldn't
have
initial
renewal
hearings,
you
wouldn't
have
the
commission
making
choices
in
every
other
situation
about
who
will
best
serve
the
public.
and
that's
the
question
that's
being
asked
here,
where
someone
says,
i'm
going
to
abandon
the
only
spanish
language
format,
or
i'm
going
to
abandon
the
only
classical
format,
or
the
only
black
format,
is
that
person
best
serving
the
public
interest?
and
the
commission
cannot
avoid
that
determination
under
this
statutory
scheme.
in
nccb
you
said
the
reason
that
it's
okay
to
not
have
an
across-the-board
rule
about
divestiture
and
concentration
is
because
the
rights
of
both
competing
applicants
and
petitioners
to
deny,
under
309,
are
protected
because
the
commission
will
make
an
individualized
determination
in
each
case
where
those
issues
are
raised,
whether
the
concentration
issue
so
substantially
affects
the
public
interest
that
the
license
should
be
denied
or
that
it
should
be
given
to
someone
else.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
your
honor,
it's
not
my
opinion
of
the
commission's
ability
to
weigh
this.
the
commission
itself
speaks
to
this
all
the
time.
and
in
initial
application,
if
there's
an
open
frequency
and
this
is
the
only
applicant,
although
he
was
asked
the
question,
how
are
you
going
to
contribute
to
diversity,
presumably
he
will
not
be
denied
the
license
because
he
is
not
contributing
diversity,
because
there's
no
one
else.
if,
however,
it's
a
renewal
situation
and
someone
else
comes
in
and
says,
here's
this
fellow
who's
playing
rock;
i
propose
to
program
to
the
black
community...
which
is
40
percent
of
this
community
and
which
is
otherwise
unserved.
the
commission
itself
has
said,
in
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
cameron
and
as
i
say,
as
recently
as
the
wook
case
here
in
washington,
that
that
applicant
will
be
given
a
preference,
that
that
is...
on
that
issue.
and
that
that
is
something
that
the
commission
will
look
at
and
looks
at
all
the
time.
it
does
look
at
contributions
to
diversity
when
broadcasters
raise
them.
it
simply
doesn't
look
at
decreases
in
diversity
when
citizens
raise
them.
and
in
a
sense
that
is
symptomatic
of
the
commission's
continued
hostility
to
the
united
church
of
christ
decision,
which
did
allow
the
public
in
and
which
did
allow
the
public
to
raise
these
issues.
nobody
but
the
public
knows
better.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
no,
it
wasn't,
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
has
received
such
a
citation
across
the
board
in
cases
of
this
court
and
commentators
and
whatever
that
i
think
that
there's
not
a
lot
of
question.
i
don't
even
think
that
the
commission
would
deny
that
it's
good
law.
it's
not,
of
course,
but
it's
a
very
important
and
very
substantial
explication
of
what
the
act
is
about,
why
congress
has
chosen
this
licensing
scheme,
the
kinds
of
choices
that
are
made,
so
that
this
very
special
resource,
the
electromagnetic
spectrum,
which
the
public
owns,
and
which
the
government
controls,
shall
be
used
to
serve
all
the
people.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
of
course,
your
honor,
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
overly
butter
you
up,
but
it
was
an
opinion
in
which
you
really
spoke
in
historic
and
in
policy
terms
about
the
statute,
about
the
need
for
service--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--it's
not
substantive,
but
what
it
says
is
that
the
public,
or
responsible
members
of
the
public,
are
frequently
the
best
judges
of
the
service
that
is
being
given
to
them,
and
the
act
provides
that
they
are
entitled
to
service.
that's
the
scheme
we
have.
and
as
the
opinion
said,
they
care
the
most
and
they
know
the
most,
and
they
may
be
in
the
best
position
to
vindicate
the
public
interest,
and
that's
why
they
should
be
there
in
these
format
cases.
and
i
think
it's
also
important
to
say--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
very
important
question
and
it
really
goes
to
one
of
the
confusions
that
permeate
this
case,
which
is
the
confusion
that
the
commission
engages
in
over
the
difference
between
audience
satisfaction
or
consumer
satisfaction
and
the
public
interest.
it
is
very
clear
that
the
marketplace
in
radio
is
not
between
the
listener
and
the
broadcaster.
listeners
are
the
bait
by
which
broadcasters
obtain
advertising--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
they're
also
interested
in
that
segment
of--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
but
justice
stewart,
it's
not
just
their
tastes
or
whether
they
listen,
it's
whether
they
have
dollars
to
spend
on
products
that
advertisers
wish
to
advertise,
which
is
why
you
see
perpetually
that
large
portions
of
the
population
or
large
minorities,
the
poor,
racial
minorities,
children,
the
elderly--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--are
not
served.
listeners
to
country
and
western
are
at
least
perceived
by
advertisers
as
having
good
demographics,
as
having
high
disposable
income,
and
therefore
you
may
see
four
country
and
western
stations
or
five
rock
stations,
because
those
consumers
are
favored
consumers,
and
nothing
that
broadcasts
to
the
elderly,
little
that
broadcasts
to
children,
little
that
broadcasts
to
racial
minorities
who
are
not
perceived
as
being
markets
for
the
advertisers.
so,
in
fact,
the
scheme
of
the
act...
and
we're
not
certainly
not
asking
and
there's
nothing
in
this
decision
that
says
the
commission
should
go
out
and
say,
aha,
here's
an
unserved
minority,
let's
allocate
a
station.
i
mean,
that's
what
in
a
sense
the
legislative
history
that's
talked
about
throughout
all
the
briefs
talks
about.
and
that's
not
at
issue
here;
we're
not
talking
about
allocations.
what
we
are
talking
about,
though,
is
that
where
there
is
diversity,
where
there
isn't
a
minority
taste
or
a
minority
ethnic
or
a
minority
age
group,
a
group
of
listeners
who
after
all
own
the
air
waves
just
as
much
as
the
people
who
buy
pimple
cream,
that
when
that
minority--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--hopefully
not.
--when
that
minority
is
being
served
and
a
broadcaster
says,
i
don't
want
to
do
that
anymore,
i'd
rather
play
rock
and
make
more
money,
that
that
is
a
legitimate
question,
that
that
decrease
in
diversity,
that
decrease
in
service
to
that
minority
audience
is
a
part
of
the
public
interest
that
the
commission
should
look
at
in
deciding
whether
to
renew
the
license
or
grant
the
transfer,
or
whatever.
it
doesn't
have
to
decide
it
in
favor
of
keeping
format;
it
doesn't
require
that...
the
d.
c.
circuit
in
the
opinion
below
is
extraordinarily
careful
to
say
how
very
limited
its
holding
is,
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
tell
people
they
must
retain
formats
or
what
they
must
play.
it
simply
must
look
at
the
effect
on
diversity
of
the
loss
of
the
unique
format,
what
that's
raised
by
a
substantial
group
of
the
public.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
your
honor,
they
don't
tell
the
licensee
he
must
continue.
every
licensee
runs
on
his
record.
every
licensee
who
has
no
property
right
beyond
the
three
years
knows...
it
doesn't
happen
frequently...
but
knows
that
if
somebody
comes
along
and
says,
i'll
do
better,
that
the
commission
has
the
absolute
power,
although
it
chooses
not
to
exercise
it
very
frequently,
to
replace
him
with
someone
who
will
serve
better.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
right
and
it
doesn't
compel
anyone
to
do
anything.
the
prospective
licensee
clearly
has
no
right
to--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
no,
the
prospective
licensee
clearly
is
out
of
it.
he
has
no
right
to
the
license
at
all.
so
that
the
fact
that
he
is
being
told,
we
don't
need
more
rock,
certainly
doesn't
violate
his
rights
in
any
way.
and
the
present
licensee
is
simply
being
told,
if
you
don't
want
to
program
this,
you
can
go
away.
if
somebody
else
wants
to
program
this
format,
we're
going
to
give
them
a
preference
because
this
is
a
minority
portion
of
the
community
that
deserves
service
under
the
universal
service
standard
of
the
act,
and
that
the
public
interest
would
best
be
served.
no
one
is
compelled
to
continue;
there
is
not
a
common
carrier
obligation.
but
the
other
side
of
common
carrier,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
this,
is
that
licensees
don't
get
financial
and
economic
protection
from
the
commission
either.
that's
what
the
sanders
brothers
case
says.
in
sanders
brothers
there
was
a
licensee
in
the
community.
the
commission
said,
we're
going
to
put
in
another
station,
because
that
will
increase
diversity
in
this
community.
and
the
first
licensee
came
in
and
said,
wait
a
minute,
you're
going
to
cut
into
our
profits,
there
aren't
going
to
be
enough
advertisers,
we
don't
want
this
guy
in
here.
don't
let
him
in.
and
this
court
held,
that's
not
what
it's
about.
the
commission's
interest,
the
commission's
vindication
of
the
public's
interest
in
diversity
far
overrides
the
broadcaster's
interest
in
profits.
he's
given
the
license,
he's
allowed
to
exploit
it;
if
he
makes
money,
fine;
if
he
doesn't
make
money,
fine.
that's
not
the
commission's
concern
unless
it
involves
ultimately
a
decrease
or
a
diminution
of
the
public
service.
he's
not
a
common
carrier,
he's
not
entitled
to
protection.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
your
honor,
that
obviously...
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
one
is
to
just
restate,
in
case
this
is
troubling
you
at
all,
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
court
has
held
numerous
times
that
the
first
amendment
is
not
violated
by
not
renewing
a
licensee
because
someone
else
will
better
serve
the
public.
the
question
of
how
diversity
is
implicated
or
weighed
is
a
fact
question
in
every
case.
it's
precisely
the
kind
of
fact
question
that
the
commission
decides
all
the
time.
and
in
fact
it's
very
illustrative
that
in
the
ten
years
that
the
commission
has
lived
under
first
voice
of
atlanta
and
then
wefm
and
now
this
case,
that
it
has
found
in
various
instances
that
diversity
is
not
terribly
affected.
there
was
a
case
recently;
this
is
a
station
in
cincinnati,
where
the
commission
said
there
are
three
other
stations
in
the
market
that
play
roughly
the
same
thing,
therefore
diversity
won't
really
be
affected,
therefore
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
hearing,
therefore
it
doesn't
impact
on
the
public
interest
in
such
a
way
that
you
lose
your
license.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
there
might
also
be
situations...
and
sadly
enough,
since
i
represent
a
lot
of
classical
music
lovers...
there
are
situations
where
very
unique
formats
are
abandoned,
and
there
is
not
the
sufficient
public
grumbling
which
the
d.
c.
circuit
has
said
must
occur,
and
nothing
happens
at
all.
and
that
licensee
gets
a
free
ride.
but
he's
not
entitled
to
economic
protection.
nobody
by
virtue
of
having
a
license
is
entitled
to
be
protected
against
the
vicissitudes
of
a
system
premised
on
a
choice
among
licensees
for
who
will
best
serve
the
public.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well,
your
honor,
because
the
whole
point
is,
is
the
public
interest
in
diversity
being
affected?
if
a
number
of
people
come
forward
and
say,
this
is
terrible,
that
we're
losing
this
spanish
format,
or
terrible
that
we're
not
going
to
have
classical
music
anymore;
there
are
400,000
of
us,
we've
listened
to
it
and
we
love
it.
then
that
goes
to
the
impact
on
diversity
which
is
part
of
the
public
interest
standard,
which
the
commission
has
to
decide.
it
may
decide,
for
example,
that
the
first
black
station
or
the
first
haitian
station
in
new
york
will
be
offered
instead,
and
that
that
offsets
the
loss
in
diversity.
it's
clearly
a
fact
determination
but
it's
not
a
fact
determination
any
different
from
the
determination
that
the
commission
makes
in
a
comparative
situation
where
a
broadcaster
says,
give
me
the
license
because
i'm
going
to
do
something
you
need,
because
i'm
going
to
contribute
to
diversity.
and,
in
fact,
across
the
board
the
commission
looks
at
this
kind
of
programming.
as
recently
as
in
one
of
the
rko
license
renewals
that
have
been
going
on,
rko
was
allowed
to
show
meritorious
service
because
it
broadcast...
this
was
the
station
in
los
angeles...
because
it
broadcast
concerts
of
the
los
angeles
philharmonic.
the
commission
looks
at
this
all
the
time
when
broadcasters
raise
it.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
part
of
the
public
interest.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
yes,
your
honor.
clearly,
the
court
of
appeals
has
spoken
and
again,
very
carefully,
grounded
their
decision
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
must
be
frank
with
you
and
tell
you
that
when
we
started
litigating
these
cases
we
had
hoped
that
we
could
challenge
format
changes
whenever
they
occurred
because
we
felt
their
impact
on
the
public
interest
and
diversity
was
so
great.
the
court
of
appeals
has
very
carefully
grounded
this
in
the
statutory
requirement
that
on
its
decision
on
these
applications
the
commission
must
make
a
determination.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
so
that
it
is
only
renewals
and
transfers
that
are
involved
here.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
i'm
sorry,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
oh,
of
course,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
rvr
situation
was
already
mentioned.
there
was
a
24-hour
jazz
station
in
new
york,
wrvr.
its
license
comes
up
for
renewal
in
the
spring
of
'81.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
it
has
changed
to
a
country
and
western
format
which
duplicates--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--a
month
ago.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
and
under
the
d.
c.
circuit's
decision...
and
i
believe,
under
the
statute,
and
hopefully
under
your
opinion
here,
when
that
license
comes
up
for
renewal,
if
in
fact
the
50,000
people
who
have
already
petitioned
are
joined
by
200,000
more
and
there
is
a
substantial
showing
that
there
is
a
need
and
a
unique
service
here
and
a
community
that's
served,
and
financial
viability
for
the
format,
then
it
will
be
raised.
it
will
not
do
much
for
the
jazz
listeners
who
want
to
hear
it
now,
but
it
is
there
to
be
raised
in
the
public
interest
determination.
and
i
think
that's...
it's
also
illustrative
of
how
limited
this
decision
is,
but
still
how--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--if
he
said
that?
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
of
course
it
would.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
right.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
exactly.
and
obviously,
the
licensees,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
at
this
point,
if
it's
not
a
transfer
situation,
have
figured
out
that
it's
better
to
do
it
mid-license
term
because
maybe
by
the
time
the
license
comes
up
the
public
grumbling
will
disperse
or
people
will
be
happier,
whatever.
but
nevertheless
the
question
of
the
decrease
in
that
service
area
and
to
that
minority
community
is
still
there.
the
public
grumbling
may
dissipate.
again,
justice
rehnquist,
your
licensee
may
get
away
with
it.
that's
the
chance
he
takes.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
well--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--your
honor,
that's
really...
that
goes
to
the
problem
with
the
inquiry
here.
this
commission
was
told
by
the
d.
c.
circuit
in
saying,
this
is
your
statutory
obligation,
why
don't
you
go
make
standards?
why
don't
you
go
devise
procedures
that
will
help
you
to
deal
with
this?
we
don't
want
to
wipe
you
out
although
i
must
say
there
have
been
ten
format
cases
in
ten
years,
so
it's
not
a
huge
problem
for
the
commission.
but
nevertheless,
you
can
devise
standards
which
will
weed
out
these
people,
and
in
the
very
proceeding
under
review
here
many
people
came
in,
answered
rhetorical
questions
that
were
asked
by
the
commission
about
how
much
grumbling
is
necessary,
what
should
the
burden
of
proof
be,
what,
how
do
we
decide,
you
know,
if
there's
substitutability?
and
listeners'
groups,
including
the
group
that
i
represent
here
today
submitted
extensive
comments
to
try
to
help
the
commission
develop
standards
for
dealing
with
this.
the
commission
obviously
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion
as
to
how
to
make
these
choices
and
weed
people
out,
just
as
it
weeds
people
out
in
fairness
doctrine
complaints.
all
that
is
being
said
is
that
it
must
ultimately
make
the
determination
although
it
can
weed
them
out.
what
the
commission
should
be
doing
is
devising
these
standards,
not
saying,
we
won't
follow
the
statute,
we
won't
follow
the
d.
c.
circuit.
and
i
think
that
it
can
be
quite
narrow,
that
the
circuit
has
said
it
will--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--the
statute
that
says,
before
a
transfer
or
a
renewal
can
be
granted
the
commission
must
make
a
determination
that
the
public
interest
will
be
served,
and
if
there
are
material
questions
of
fact
it
shall
hold
a
hearing.
that's
what
the
statute--
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
--well,
but
they
said
that
in
ashbacker
too
and
this
court
said,
you
may
think
that
there's
a
better
way
but
that's
what
the
statute
said
and
you
have
to
hold
the
hearing
because
the
statute
provides
that
you
have
to
hold
the
hearing.
ms.
kristin
booth
glen
i
would
certainly
hope
that
it
would
follow
ashbacker.
but
i
think
that
the
ability
to
develop
standards
is
really
something
that
is
not
so
difficult
for
the
commission,
and
the
ability
to
make
these
fact
determinations
is
not
so
terrible,
and
that
the
areas
in
which
they
do
this
are
really
quite
bewildering.
they
look
at
programs
all
the
time,
they
look
at
the
kinds
of
programming
in
renewal
and
in
comparative
hearings;
they
look
at
the
promise
of
specialized
format
in
comparative
hearings;
they
have
themselves
engaged
in
such
activities
as
developing
anti-siphoning
rules
for
pay
cable
saying,
we're
not
going
to
let
cable
play
certain
kinds
of
programming
which
we
think
the
audience
for
free
broadcasting
should
get:
feature
films,
sports,
series
programs.
in
other
words,
they
look,
they
make
judgments
all
the
time
about
programming
and
about
service.
and
they
do
it
whenever
the
licensees
and
whenever
broadcasters
ask
them
to
do
it,
and
what
they
are
saying
here
is,
we
will
not
do
it
when
the
public
asks.
and
if
this
act
is
really
about
securing
service
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states,
if
those
very
special
considerations
that
are
set
forth
in
red
lion...
and
there's
just
no
way,
you
know,
that
anybody
arguing
this
case
can
say
it
better
than
what
red
lion
said
about
that
if
this
resource
is
to
be
used,
that
if
it
is
the
rights
of
the
public
that
are
paramount,
then
the
commission
simply
cannot
take
the
position
that
what
it
will
do
for
the
broadcasters
it
will
not
do
for
the
public,
that
it
will
not
serve
minority
communities,
that
it
will
let
the
marketplace
and
marketplace
forces
dictate
these
choices
to
the
detriment
of
racial,
ethnic,
undemographically
favored
consumers.
it
must
make
this
decision.
if
it
doesn't
want
to
make
the
decision
it
can
go
to
congress
and
ask
congress
to
ask
to
change
the
statute,
but
until
it
does
the
statute
makes
it
very
clear.
and
perhaps
in
conclusion,
i
am
reminded
of
a
ditty,
as
it
were,
but
it
seems
appropriate
to
me,
from
the
first
act
of
ruddigore,
in
which
richard
dauntless...
and
i
would
like
to
think
of
the
commission
as
dauntless
in
this
even
though
they
have
been
somewhat
misguided...
states,
"for
duty,
duty
must
be
done;
the
rule
applies
to
everyone."
"and
painful
though
that
duty
be,
to
shirk
the
task
were
fiddle-dee-dee."
congress
has
put
the
task
of
making
these
public
interest
determinations
in
the
hands
of
the
commission,
not
in
the
hands
of
the
marketplace.
the
commission
may
not
like
it
but
it
is
guided
by
a
standard
which
it
applies
across
the
board
in
every
other
situation.
its
job
is
to
decide
who
will
best
serve
the
public
who
owns
the
airwaves,
and
the
decision
of
the
d.
c.
circuit
below
does
no
more
than
say
that
it
must
make
that
determination
in
a
principled
way,
a
way
which
will
be
reviewed
deferentially
by
the
court,
but
that
it
must
make
the
determination.
that's
what
the
case
below
says,
and
we
would
urge
your
affirmance
on
that
basis.
