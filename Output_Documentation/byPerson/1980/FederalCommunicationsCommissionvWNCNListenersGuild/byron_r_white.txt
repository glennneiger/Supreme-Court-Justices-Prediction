justice
byron
r.
white
at
issue
here
is
a
policy
of
the
federal
communications
commission
under
which
the
commission
in
the
courts
are
passing
on
applications
for
renewal
or
transfer
of
a
radio
station’s
license.
we'll
not
consider
or
take
into
account
entertainment
format
changes
that
have
occurred
or
--
or
about
to
occur.
the
commission
prefers
to
rely
on
market
forces
and
competition
among
radio
stations
to
serve
the
public
interests.
this
policy
was
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
by
various
consumer
groups
who
claim
that
the
commission’s
policy
did
not
sufficiently
served
public
interests
in
providing
diversity
in
--
in
program
format
or
in
preserving
unique
entertainment
programs.
the
court
of
appeals
overturned
the
commission’s
policy
holding
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
federal
communications
act.
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
the
reasons
that
are
detailed
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
as
we
understand
the
governing
statute.
it
may
not
require
the
commission’s
policy
but
certainly
it
does
not
forbid
it.
so
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
marshall
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
