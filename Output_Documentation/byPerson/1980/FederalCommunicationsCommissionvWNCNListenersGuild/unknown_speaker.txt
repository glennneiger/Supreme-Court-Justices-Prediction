unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
emphasize
radio.
do
you
think
it
has
no
bearing
on
broadcasting
generally?
unknown
speaker
mr.
saylor,
what
was
not
entirely
clear
to
me
in
reading
the
briefs
is,
are
we
talking
about
changes
that
have
been
made
or
prospective
changes,
or
both?
unknown
speaker
both?
unknown
speaker
renewal
or
transfer.
unknown
speaker
would
the
standard
be
any
different
if
we
were
talking
about
the
initial
issuance
of
a
license,
if
such
licenses
were
available?
all
the
statute
says
as
i
read
it
is
the
public
interest.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
how
you
relate
that
to
the
issues.
let
me
put
another
question
to
you.
suppose
on
renewal
of
a
license
at
the
expiration
of
three
years
the
representatives
of
the
listening
audience
came
in
and
demonstrated
that
this
station
had
changed
its
format
and
was
showing
nothing
except
football
games,
basketball
games,
hockey
games,
prizefights,
and
athletic
events;
nothing
else.
would
that
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
renewal
of
the
license?
unknown
speaker
so
the
format
if...
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
that
term
embraces
in
this
case,
but
the
content
of
programming
is
a
very
relevant
factor
in
the
renewal
of
a
license,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
the
standard
is
the
same
for
both
the
issuance
of
the
original
license
and
for
the
renewal,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
commission
treat
them
differently
in
the
sense
of
evaluating
entertainment
versus
news
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
it's
basically
a
quantitative
consideration?
unknown
speaker
plus,
i
suppose,
objectivity
and
fairness
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
saylor,
what
about
the
percentage
of
time
for
commercials?
is
there
any
regulation
of
that?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
justification
for
that
other
than
its
possible
impact
on
the
entertainment
part
of
the
programming.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
distinction
between
quantity
and
quality
becomes
a
little
blurred,
does
it
not,
if
quantitatively
all
or
most
of
the
program
is
devoted
to
one
kind
of
activity,
namely,
the
athletics
that
i
suggested
in
the
hypothetical?
does
that
not
come
into
the
area
of
quality
of
service,
by
the
failure
to
have
any
news
broadcasts,
by
the
failure
to
have
any
educational
broadcasts,
any
music?
unknown
speaker
i
have
to
ask
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask,
and
i
don't
mind
asking
after
what
you
just
said.
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
i
don't
have
to
find
out
the
difference
between
rock,
hard
rock,
and
jazz,
do
i?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
real
question
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
to
whether
the
commission
would
know
whether
a
change
is
planned
or
had
taken
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
limits
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
as
i
understand
it
is
that
if
a
change
is
contemplated
the
commission
should
take
into
consideration
whether
or
not
there's
some...
whether
it's
economically
sound
and
whether
there's
a
public
market
for
it
or
a
public
demand
for
it.
and
if
it
is,
the
commission
ought
to
really
think
about
whether
they
ought
to
permit
the
change.
is
that
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
part
of
it,
but
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
held?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
almost
never
would
a
hearing
be
necessary.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
is
it
right
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
must
be
a
hearing
every
time?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
it
the
commission's
submission
that
considering
those
threshold
matters
that
you
just
listed
is
beyond
the
commission's
competence
or
that's
just
a
wrong
construction
of
the
statute?
and
i
suppose
you
would
suggest
that
raises
a
first
amendment
question.
unknown
speaker
does
this
represent
a
change
of
mind
by
the
commission,
or
has
it
always
had
this
position?
unknown
speaker
but
prior
to
1970
the
commission's
position
was
always
what
you
say
it
should
be
today?
unknown
speaker
or
it
is
today?
unknown
speaker
subject
always
to
the
risk
that
he
may
be
confronted
with
some
complaints
at
the
time
of
renewal
of
the
license
on
program
content.
unknown
speaker
haven't
some
licenses
been
lost
on
that
grounds?
unknown
speaker
not
on
entertainment,
but
on
content
of
the
total
broadcast,
the
use
of
the
total
broadcast
time?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
change
that
happens
to
be
at
issue
in
a
renewal
proceeding
is
an
abandonment
of
any
news
content
in
the
broadcast
day?
suppose
in
the
midterm
a
licensee
abandons
any
kind
of
diversity
in
its
program
and
goes
to,
say,
all
sports,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
and
no
news,
no
educational
matters,
and
things
like
that.
then,
would
you
say
that's
to
be
left
to
the
marketplace
completely?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
my
question.
i
mean
they...
the
licensee
did
intend
to
fulfill
it
at
the
outset
and
then
changed
it,
but
in
the
midterm
it
decides
to
change
to
all
sports
or
in
a
transfer
proceeding
the
transferee
proposes
to
go
to
all
sports,
whereas
his
predecessor
had
a
little
variety
in
his
program.
now,
is
that
a...
would
that
be
outside
the
reach
of
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
the
commission
have
the
power
to,
under
the
statute
to
deny
the
transfer
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
different
than
the
issue
that's
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
is
virtually
unbridled
discretion
unless
it's
somehow
filled
in
by
the
fcc,
and
how
has
the
fcc
filled
it
in
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
the
commission's
position
that
if
there's
a
proposal
to
switch
from
one
kind
of
diversity
to
another,
that's
the
business
of
the
broadcaster?
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
broadcaster
wants
to
shift
from
a
program
that's
got
some
diversity
in
it
to
a
thoroughly
unique
program,
all
one-sided
or
all
one
content,
that
he
is
in
trouble?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
may
not
get
renewal
then,
or
the
transfer
may
not
go
through;
right?
unknown
speaker
so
your
suggestion
is
that
these
are
exactly
the
kinds
of
judgments
of
the
public
interest
that
the
commission
ought
to
make
rather
than
a
court?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
suggest
that
all
of
those
things
that
we've
just
been
talking
about,
are
they
equally
suspect
under
the
first
amendment?
i
guess
you
can't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
the
shift
from...
is
it
equally
suspect
under
the
first
amendment
to
object
to
shifting
to
uniqueness
as
it
is
to
shift
from
one
diversity
to
another?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
first
amendment
argument
then.
unknown
speaker
mr.
saylor,
when
a
license
is
initially
granted,
particularly
where
you
have
competition
between
two
applicants,
is
entertainment
program
format
relevant
in
the
commission's
view?
unknown
speaker
does
it
inquire
into
the
entertainment
program
format
of
a
prospective
applicant?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
even
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
usually
ask?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
been
asking
that
question
up
to
now.
and
i'm
just...
why
would
that
even
be
relevant
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
why
has
it
done
it...
it's
done
this
for
years,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
it
would
never
be
significant
in
choosing
between
rival
applicants?
unknown
speaker
going
back,
mr.
dyk,
to
this
question
in
the
application,
either
an
initial
application
or
a
transfer
with
a
new
transferee,
is
the
question
in
your
view
directed...
questions
about
program
content...
and
they
do;
the
commission
does
ask
about
that...
is
that
directed
at
determining
whether
there
is
the
appropriate
diversity
or
is
it
directed
at
the
quantitative
aspects
of
a
particular
program?
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
form
for
an
original
license?
unknown
speaker
inform
me
what
you
mean
by
specialized
format.
you
say,
90
percent
of
the
radio
stations
have
a
specialized
format?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
when
the
commission
has
reached
its
determination
along
these
lines,
that
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
to
regulate
as
it
has,
what
is
the
standard
of
review
which
the
court
of
appeals
applies
to
review
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
contrary
to
law
standard.
unknown
speaker
you're
suggesting
it's
the
contrary
to
law
standard?
unknown
speaker
the
law
being
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
statute
for
it
to
fall
back
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
statute
does
not
require
the
commission
to
take
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
took:
they
must
follow
these
factors.
do
you
think
the
statute
would
have
permitted
the
commission
to
adopt
the
same
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
effect
forced
them
to
adopt?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
thought
this
was
the
appropriate
way
to
achieve
diversity?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
for
a
constitutional
reason
or
a
statutory
reason
or
both?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
if
i
understand
your
argument
then,
it
is
not
that
the
commission
has
made
the
policy
judgment;
rather
that
congress
has
made
this
policy
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
also
contend
that
congress
made
precisely
the
same
policy
judgment?
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
that
90
percent
of
all
the
stations
have
a
particular
format?
unknown
speaker
specialized
format.
suppose
the
commission
was
confronted
with
a
situation
in
a
community
that's
served
by
five
radio
stations,
we
will
assume.
four
of
them
are
already
specialized
on
rock
music,
whatever
that
definition
embraces,
and
the
fifth
one
comes
in
and
says,
they
can
do
a
better
job
of
rock
music
than
the
others.
would
the
commission
say,
no,
we've
got
enough
rock
stations,
we
want
a
broader
base,
more
diversity
in
your
entertainment?
unknown
speaker
then,
are
you
saying
that
in
this
hypothetical,
four
stations,
all
rock
music,
and
another
one
that
is
a
so-called
good
music
station
with
a
variety
of
classical
music,
is
going
to
shift
to
the
rock
pattern
and
a
half
a
dozen
community
organizations
come
in,
the
symphony
or
the
opera
society,
choral
groups,
religious
groups,
and
say,
this
community
is
saturated
with
rock
music,
there
should
be
one
station
which
will
have
a
broad
base,
religious
music,
opera,
classical
music,
semi-classical,
popular,
the
commission
wouldn't
hear
that,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you...
from
what
do
you
draw
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
congress
in
the
'27
and
'34
acts
has
in
effect
mandated
that
the
marketplace
and
nothing
else
is
to
govern?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
because
of
a
specific
statutory
provision.
unknown
speaker
which
section
is
that,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
no.
anytime.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
regulatory
agency
and
the
court
of
appeals
don't
have
quite
the
same
view
of
the
statute,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
as
construed
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
no,
as
construed
by
you
as
well?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
kind
of
diversity?
wouldn't
it
depend
upon
what's
already
in
the
market?
let's
say
you
have
an
area,
a
metropolitan
area,
in
which
there
are
12
radio
stations,
and
eight
of
them
already
broadcast
various
kinds
of
rock
and
roll,
and/or
country
and
western
music,
various
kinds
of
it?
in
that
market,
if
an
applicant
for
a
license
said
he
wanted
a...
he
proposed
to
broadcast
as
the
entertainment
portion
of
his
programming
rock
and
roll
or
country
and
western,
it
would
be
quite
a
different
situation
from
a
market,
wouldn't
it,
where
the
ten
stations
already
broadcasted
various
sorts
of
classical
or
semi-classical
or
conventional
popular
music?
unknown
speaker
or
does
in
your
submission
each
applicant
for
a
license
or
for
a
transfer
or
for
a
renewal
have
to
himself
provide
diversity,
regardless
of
what's
already
in
the
market?
unknown
speaker
this
case
does
not
involve
the
initial--
unknown
speaker
--applicant...
it
promotes
the
same
statutory
language.
unknown
speaker
and
is
this
true
only
if
there
is
not
already
a
spanish
language
station?
or
if
it--
unknown
speaker
--then
it's
not
unique.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
was
a
unique
format
proposed
in
montana,
a
spanish-language
speaking
station
and
there
are
20
witnesses
before
the
commission,
and
all
of
them
say
they
don't
understand
the
language
and
they
wouldn't
tune
in
to
a
spanish
language
speaking
station,
and
there
is
no
proponent
of
the
thing
testifying.
does
the
commission
nonetheless
grant
a
frequency
to
the
spanish
language
speaking
station?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
a
bulgarian
language
station
would
be
unique
but
it
might
not
be
in
the
public
interest
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
the
commission
is
saying
this,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
overrule?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
commission's
position
before
1970?
unknown
speaker
when
did
this
hard
look
notion
come
up?
after
1970?
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
commission
position
or
just
several
commissioners?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
was
attached
to
their
position
they
took
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
1970?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
difference
between
them
and
the
court
of
appeals,
then,
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think...
do
you
think
this
new
policy
statement
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
policy
statement
that
six
of
the
seven
commissioners
stated
in
1970?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
that
would
seem
to
apply
whether
the
public
raised
a
fuss
or
not?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
it
be
that
we
did
look
and
don't
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
it
says
that,
we
listened
to
you
and
we
decided
the
other
way.
isn't
that
what
it
says?
unknown
speaker
i'm
only
talking
about
what
you
just
read.
unknown
speaker
they
did
give
you
a
hearing,
didn't
they?
and
they
didn't
stop
you
from
putting
on
anything
you
wanted
to
put
on?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
also
be
a
loss
of
finance
to
the
station?
unknown
speaker
so
your
only
complaint
is
they
said
they
wouldn't
look?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
their
own...
if
they
hadn't
made
that
statement
you
wouldn't
be
here?
unknown
speaker
now,
will
you
answer
my
question?
my
question
is,
if
all
they
said
was,
if
they
had
not
said,
we
wouldn't
look,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
now,
the
commission
did
not
say
it
will
not
follow
the
statute.
the
commission
said,
we
are
following
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
and
we
are
following
the
statute,
and
this
is
the
only
way
to
follow
the
statute.
that's
what
the
commission
said.
it
never
said,
we
will
not
follow
the
statute.
don't
tell
us
that.
unknown
speaker
did
it
say
we
are
going
to
violate
the
statute,
as
you've
just
argued
to
us?
unknown
speaker
and
that
that's
what
the
statute
requires.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
say
alternatively
that
the
commission
has
decided
that
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity
are
best
served
by
the
marketplace
allocation
force.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
the
way
they
construed
the
statute,
admittedly
it's
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
construction.
but
it
would
not
require
a
hearing,
an
individualized
hearing
in
every
case.
they
say,
we're
going
to
let
the
marketplace
do
it.
unknown
speaker
some
of
this
discussion
has
left
me
a
little
bit
confused,
but
maybe
you
can
clear
it
up.
you'll
recall
the
hypothetical
i
gave
to
your
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
about
the
community
with
five
radio
stations,
four
of
them
already
in
rock,
and
the
fifth
one
is
going
to
move...
and
this
is
either
on
a
renewal
or
at
any
time...
going
to
move
into
all
rock,
because
rock
is
doing
so
well.
now,
what's
your
position
on
the
scope
of
the
commission's
authority
to
weigh
the
diversity
of
programming
over
the
whole
community
and
over
all
of
the
stations?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
wasn't
a
decision
of
this
court.
unknown
speaker
that
holding
didn't
go
to
what
you
have
just
suggested.
that
holding
went
only
to
to
the
parties
that
the
commission
must
hear,
not
how
the
commission
should
decide
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
the
judges
who
decided
it
thought
it
was
a
pretty
narrow
issue,
in
terms
of
intervention,
not
substantive.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
the
commission's
policy
follow
directly
from
that
statement?
insofar
as
the
public
lets
its
wishes
be
known,
it
does
so
by
tuning
in
to
various
stations,
and
the
ownership
or
management
of
a
station
would
know
that,
and
with
the
profit
motive
motivating
it,
it
would
give
the
public
what
it
wanted.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
broadcasters
are
only
interested
in
that
segment
of
the
public
which
are
potential
radio
listeners.
unknown
speaker
some
people
just
never
listen
to
the
radio
and
broadcasters
presumably
would
have
no
interest
in
their
tastes,
even
if
their
tastes
represented
15
percent
of
the
community.
unknown
speaker
listeners
to
country
and
western?
unknown
speaker
they
might
be
the
same
people.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
issue
is
raised,
you
have
to
assume
there
will
be
some
cases
in
which
they
would
tell
the
licensee,
you
must
continue
the
same
format.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
part
of
your
position
that
in
a
given
transfer
application
that
would
involve
a
dramatic
change
of
format,
that
there
would
be
some
case
in
which
the
public
could
come
in
and
convince
the
commission
that
they
should
not
allow
the
change
to
take
place
because
they
want
to
retain
the
old
format,
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
retain
the
old
format?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
compels
them
not
to
do
something
they
want
to
do.
unknown
speaker
when
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
diversity,
it
sounds
quite
easy
and
manageable
when
you
start
talking,
or
when
you
first
think
of
it,
but
when
you
start
thinking
of
examples
of
it,
there
is
going
to
be
kind
of
hanging
over
the
head
of
any
programmer
who...
as
justice
stevens
suggests...
who
wants
to
abandon
a
unique
format,
the
threat
that
his
license
would
be
not
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
three-year
period.
now,
to
what
extent
does
the
commission
have
to
weigh
diversity?
unknown
speaker
the
only
reason
you
have
a
hearing
is
because
there's
an
issue
of
fact
that
could
result
in
some
different
outcome.
i
mean,
just
to
say
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
have
a
hearing
isn't
dispositive
of
the
case,
because
if
you're
having
a
hearing
it
must
be
about
some
meaningful
contested
issue
of
fact
that
will
result
in
a
different
outcome
depending
on
how
it's
decided.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
the
public
is
the
ultimate
arbiter,
as
in
your
view,
why
should
public
grumbling
from
more
than
one
citizen
be
required,
in
order
to
hold
a
hearing
on
diversity?
unknown
speaker
ms.
glen,
do
you
agree
with
opposing
counsel
that
the
commission's
statement
of
policy
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
relate
both
to
program
changes
that
have
been
made
and
those
that
are
proposed
to
be
made?
unknown
speaker
on
renewals
or
on
transfers.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
wasn't
really
my
question.
yes,
i
understand
that
you're
in
agreement
that
it
only
applies
to
renewals
and
transfers.
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
apply
to
program
changes
that
have
been
made
as
well
as
those
that
are
proposed
to
be
made
to
both?
unknown
speaker
and
it
has
changed?
unknown
speaker
during
the
three-year--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
it
already
had
its
license.
unknown
speaker
it
will
be
equally
true
in
a
renewal
or
transfer
proceeding
in
the
commission
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
the
commission's
statement
of
policy
that
if
the
proposed
transferee
or
if
the
applicant
for
renewal
said,
if
this
transfer
is
affected
or
if
the
renewal
of
my
license
is
effected,
i'm
going
to
change
my
programming
format.
unknown
speaker
yes.
this
would
also
be
applicable.
unknown
speaker
both
the
changes
that
have
been
made--
unknown
speaker
--and
those
proposed
to
be
made.
unknown
speaker
how
large
a
segment
of
the
public
does
it
have
to
be?
unknown
speaker
supposing,
instead
of
your
300,000
hispanics,
it's
200
hispanics?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
say,
"we
won't
follow
the
statute".
what
statute?
the
public
interest?
unknown
speaker
but
the
commission
has
said
that
that
isn't
the
way
to
read
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
this
court
presumably
will
have
to
say
this
one
way
or
the
other
here.
unknown
speaker
ms.
cooke,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
someone
opens
a
theater
in
a
particular
community,
large
community
of
new
york
or
san
antonio
where
most
of
the
people
are
spanish-speaking;
at
least,
that's
their
primary
language;
a
theater,
or
a
movie
theater,
or
a
bookstore.
and
the
odds
are
they're
not
going
to
do
very
well
if
they
don't
put
on
spanish
language
movies
or
sell
spanish
language
books.
is
that
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
now,
well,
isn't
that
likely
to
be
true
as
a
matter
of
economics?
if
you
aren't
selling
what
the
purchasers
want
in
that
neighborhood,
they're
not
likely
to
give
you
much
business.
now,
how
far
do
you
carry
that
when
you
move
out
of
the
private
theater,
which
can
put
on
whatever
kind
of
movies
it
wants,
in
any
language
it
wants,
bulgarian,
or
yugoslav,
whether
they
have
customers
or
not,
to
a
radio
station,
and
how
do
you
make
the
distinction?
how
much
response
must
the
commission
require?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
the
community,
a
spanish-speaking
community,
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
broadcasts
in
spanish?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
saying
there
is
some
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
broadcaster
to
put
the
broadcasts
in
the
language
of
a
substantial
number
of
listeners?
unknown
speaker
but
not
as
a
constitutional
matter,
you
say?
unknown
speaker
this
particular
distinction
says,
we're
doing
very
well
without
any
spanish
language
broadcasts
and
if
someone
else
can
have
spanish
language
broadcasts,
this
is
the
united
states
and
the
language
of
this
country
is
american.
and
we
aren't
going
to
broadcast
anything
in
spanish,
even
if
we
lose
some
business,
as
long
as
we're
doing
pretty
well
without
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
saylor,
right
on
that
point,
do
you
share
the
view
of
mr.
dyk
that
the
policy
judgment
was
made
by
congress
rather
than
by
the
commission,
and
that
the
commission
was
required
to
take
this
position
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
you
take
no
position
on
whether
the
court
of
appeals
position
would
be
consistent
with
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
in
a
free
market
you
can
rely
on
adam
smith's
principles
to
achieve
your
diversity;
the
entertainment
market
generally.
and
if
a
person
wants
to
make
a
foolish
investment
he
is
free
to
do
so
and
no
harm's
done.
but
suppose
you
have
a
case
with
a
limited
number
of
radio
stations
that
some
very
wealthy
eccentric
person
decided
to
buy
a
station
and
broadcast
nothing
except
some
program
nobody
was
really
interested
in,
maybe
russian
folk
music
or
something,
that
nobody
wanted
to
hear,
and
you
could
demonstrate
that
the
audience
was
practically
zero.
would
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
take
the
license,
to
decline
to
renew
the
license
at
the
end
of
the
three-year
period
under
the
policy
statement?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
does
take
the
position
you
won't
look
at
program
content
at
all--
--the
policy
statement,
and
this
court's
decisions,
only
go
to
a
change
in
programming,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
people
do
publish
books
that
don't
make
them
any
money,
just
because
they
want
to
vindicate
their
egos,
and
have
some
special
interest
in
it.
that
could
happen
in
the
radio
field.
unknown
speaker
even
in
that
case,
you'd
let
the
free
market
make
its
decision?
unknown
speaker
mr.
saylor,
with
reference
to
the
zenith
radio
corporation
matter
before
the
fcc
referred
to
on
the
petition
for
cert,
appendix
134a,
in
which
the
commission
recites
that
in
the
zenith
radio
case
it
had
taken
a
hard
look
position?
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
1973,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
after
the
voice
of
atlanta
case.
unknown
speaker
was
that
hard
look
position
adopted
under
the
pressure
of
the
voice
of
atlanta,
or
had
it
always
been
the
commission's
view?
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
voice
of
atlanta
case
the
commission
appeared
before
the
court
of
appeals
asserting
that
it
should
let
the
market--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
six-commissioner
statement
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
sure
it
was
an
aberration.
it
was
no
more
of
an
aberration
than
the
hard
look
zenith
radio
position.
it
was
just
that
it
was
at
a...
well,
that
six-commissioner--
unknown
speaker
--statement
was
in
197--
unknown
speaker
--exactly.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
say
it
was
under
pressure
of
the
court
of
appeals
position?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
the
commissioners
said,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
your
submission
is
that
prior
to
the
voice
of
atlanta
case
the
commission's
position
was
exactly
what
it
is
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
like
it
is
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
had
been
consistently
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
the
fcc
petition
for
certiorari
for
some
of
those
earlier
decisions?
