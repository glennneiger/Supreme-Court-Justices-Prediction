ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
and
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ,
and
major
spanish-mexican-american
civil
rights
organizations
which
include
the
mexican-american
legal
defense
and
educational
fund,
and
the
bicultural-bilingual
coalition
on
mass
media.
these
respondents
share
a
common
belief
that
the
implications
of
the
order
under
review
here
today
encompass
not
only
a
question
of
whether
we,
the
public,
will
have
access
to
diverse
musical
and
entertainment
experiences
but
involve
central
premises
of
our
broadcast
system.
first,
that
in
a
democratic
society
all
substantial
segments
of
the
public
should
have
some
means
of
self-expression
and
access
to
information
necessary
to
exercise
their
rights
as
citizens.
and
secondly,
that
at
least
primary
first
broadcast
service
should
be
provided
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states.
because
these
issues
are
presented
most
vividly
in
the
context
of
foreign
language
programming
and
other
specialized
ethnic
formats,
we'd
like
to
make
three
points
to
the
count
today
in
the
time
allotted
to
us.
first
of
all,
that
these
formats
are
a
critical
aspect
of
this
case.
they
demonstrate,
first,
that
one
cannot
draw
a
strict
dichotomy
between
entertainment
and
so-called
non-entertainment
informational
features
of
radio
service.
secondly,
they
also
demonstrate
that
the
fcc's
administrative
nightmare
argument
as
a
justification
for
its
absolute
refusal
to
look
at
any
format
change
is
suspect.
and
finally,
it
also
demonstrates
the
importance
of
the
public
rights
and
concerns
which
the
commission
has
decided
must
be
met
by
economic
forces
or
be
totally
ignored.
in
the
context
of
the
third
point
we'd
like
to
discuss
the
commission's
11th
hour
suggestion
that
these
formats
were
not
covered
by
the
opinion
under
review.
with
respect
to
the
totality
of
program
service
on
radio,
we
think
that
the
industry's
and
the
fcc's
attempt
to
minimize
the
importance
of
the
issue
of
format
diversity
by
characterizing
it
as
simply
entertainment
not
only
ignores
this
court's
decision
in
red
lion
but
also
ignores
the
particularly
critical
role
of
foreign
language
and
special
ethnic
formats
in
fostering
and
preserving
cultural
heritage
as
well
as
promoting
assimilation
in
our
country.
ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
that
may
be
true.
ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
we
start
from
the
premise
in
the
particular
hypothetical
that
you've
posited,
that
the
aura
of
first
amendment
rights
in
the
broadcasting
spectrum
is
somewhat
different,
that
this
court
has
always
differentiated
between
the
kinds
of
protections
involved
in
other
first
amendment
areas,
print
and
so
forth,
and
broadcast.
and
that,
in
broadcast,
because
of
the
scarcity
arguments
and
also
because
of
the
public
ownership,
and
because
of
the
licensing
scheme
which
declares
that
in
order...
because
all
cannot
speak,
then
some
mechanism
must
be
available
so
that
many
thoughts
can
be
heard,
that
the
order
is
different.
but
even
in
the
context
of
format
the
commission
has
always
said
that
it
is
not
the
tastes
of
individual
persons
that
is
to
be
acknowledged
necessarily,
but
that
substantial
segments
of
a
population
must
be
addressed.
where
in
broadcast
a
radio
situation
will
come
in
and
the
segment
of
the
community
that
is
unserved
is
20
or
30
percent,
or
whatever
particular
standard
the
commission
devises,
then
that
is
a
substantial
segment,
and
as
part
of
the
public
owners
of
the
air
waves,
it
is
a
consideration
in
terms
of
diversity.
and
so
that
the
order
and
the
concerns
are
different
in
the
theater
and
the
private
enterprise
system,
and
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
licensing
system
in
which
there
is
not
ownership
and
property
rights.
i
think
the
other
question
that
makes
the
broadcast
situation
vastly
different
is
that
in
non-entertainment
situations
the
commission
has
neglected
to
emphasize
that
the
non-entertainment
informational
programming
is
selective
and
focuses
on
a
particular
group,
so
that
one
does
not
have
spanish
informational
services
in
the
context
of
a
black
radio
format,
and
the
two
welded
together.
this
is
important
because
in
the
specialized
format
situation
of
foreign
language
programming,
the
loss
of
the
format
may
equal
the
loss
of
effective
broadcast
services.
how
can
a
licensee
address
community
needs
or
problems
or
services
if
a
large
segment
of
the
community
cannot
effectively
communicate
in
that
language.
secondly,
we
just
raise
very
briefly...
ms.
glen
has
referred
to
the
fcc's
administrative
nightmare
argument,
but
it
becomes
even
more
suspect
when
it
is
applied
to
respondent's
concerns.
clearly
there
is
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
a
spanish
language
station
from
other
stations,
or
determining
whether
or
not
that
format
is
unique,
or
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact
a
substantial
population
that
will
be
unserved,
not
simply
underserved
by
the
loss
of
that
format.
ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
a
constitutional
right
except
in
the
sense
that
we
need
not
look
that
far;
we
can
look
at
the
act
itself,
which
provides
in
terms
of
allocations
that
the
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
establish
primary
service
to
all
people
of
the
united
states.
i
think
there
does
become
a
question
in
terms
of
service
when
people
cannot
understand
that,
and
so
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
the
commission
has
to
raise
in
terms
of
making
decisions
about
allocations.
and
in
fact,
this
court,
in
allentown,
the
fcc
v.
allentown,
took
on
the
same
kind
of
considerations.
it
did
so
in
the
context
of
geographic
communities
rather
than
ethnic
communities,
and
what
we're
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
same
kind
of
reasoning
which
is
premised
in
the
statutory
system,
and
the
allocations
policy
should
also
be
one
of
the
factors
that
the
commission
consider
under
the
public
interest
standard.
one
example
we
might
use
is
that
the
commission
uses
it,
and
as
ms.
glen
has
pointed
out
to
the
court,
when
the
public
comes
in
the
values
may
shift.
for
example,
there
is
present
in
the
record
before
the
court
a
situation
in
alice,
texas,
in
which
a
licensee
came
in
to
the
commission
at
a
comparative
stage
and
said,
i
will
do
spanish
programming
to
a
community
that
is
comprised
of
65
percent
mexican
americans
and
are
clearly
bilingual.
on
the
basis
of
that
it
was
preferred
and
it
got
the
station
and
three
months
later
terminated
that
format
and
went
to
top
40.
under
the
commission's
policy
statement
which
suggests
that
the
commission
make
an
inquiry
into
diversity
and
concern
at
initial
licensing,
this
particular
format
change,
although
it
might
have
been
perfectly
viable
financially,
is
precluded
from
inquiry
and
precluded
from
challenge
under
this
particular
statement.
finally,
what
we
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
the
commission--
ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
--the
commission
itself
has
suggested
this.
one
of
them--
ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
--but
as
a
question
of
the
statutory
obligation,
yes.
i
think
there
are
constitutional
implications
of
a
decision
that
says
that
the
reality
of
first
amendment
rights
is
such
that
we
have
large
segments
of
our
community
whose
first
amendment
rights
can
only
be
addressed
in
the
context
of
their
particular
language.
i
think
that
there
are
implications
there.
but
the
commission
can
look
at
the
statute.
ms.
wilhelmina
reuben
cooke
i
would
suggest
we're
only
talking
about
something
that
has
existed,
not
an
affirmative
obligation
of
a
licensee
to
come
in
and
have
to
meet
needs.
the
commission
has
suggested
in
some
ways
that...
and,
in
fact,
this
is
one
of
the
tenets
of
allocation
and
regulation,
that
when
a
licensee
comes
in,
the
licensee
makes
certain
promises
on
the
basis
of
which
the
commission
can
find
a
grant
of
that
particular
license
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
then
that
licensee
runs
on
the
record.
here
we
would
have
a
situation
in
which
a
licensee
came
in
and
made
the
initial
determination
that
there
were
certain
needs,
exercised
their
particular
editorial
discretion,
and
then
the
commission
must
state,
to
make
certain
changes,
you
have
to
have
them
grounded
in
public
interest
considerations,
if
unmet
needs
of
substantial
segments
of
the
population
will
not
be
served.
