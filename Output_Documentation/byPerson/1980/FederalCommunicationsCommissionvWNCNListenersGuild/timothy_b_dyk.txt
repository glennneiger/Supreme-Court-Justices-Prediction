mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
we
have
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
a
policy
judgment
by
the
commission
not
to
engage
in
a
particular
kind
of
regulation
of
broadcast
programming.
and
that
fact
alone
distinguishes
this
case
from
many
of
the
other
situations
about
which
the
court
was
asking.
because
in
those
situations
the
commission
has
determined
to
engage
in
program
regulation
in
its
view
of
the
public
interest.
the
congress
in
1927
and
again
in
1934
charged
the
commission
with
the
task
of
determining
what
is
in
the
public
interest
in
broadcasting.
and
when
the
commission
gets
into
the
programming
area
that
of
course
requires
the
drawing
of
very
delicate
and
difficult
lines.
this
is
not
the
first
case
involving
such
questions
to
come
before
this
court
and
i'm
sure
it
will
not
be
the
last.
but
where
the
commission
as
here
has
reached
a
policy
judgment
that
regulation
would
not
serve
the
public
interest
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
commission
and
impose
a
regulatory
regime
which
the
commission
is
very
much
opposed
to.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
commission
asks
a
number
of
questions
on
the
form
about
programming,
including
the
quantity
of
news,
public
affairs,
informational
programming.
it
asks
questions
about
so-called
ascertainment
of
community
needs,
an
obligation
which
the
commission
has
imposed
to
require
the
broadcaster
to
go
out
in
the
community
and
interview
the
general
public
and
community
leaders
to
determine
the
problems,
needs,
and
interests
of
the
community.
the
broadcaster
is
required
to
make
lists
of
these
problems
and
to
propose
programming
responsive
to
them.
there
are
other
questions
on
the
form
also
relating
to
the
amount
of
commercials.
in
addition
to
all
of
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--it
would
both
be
on
the
form
for
an
original
license
and
for
a
renewal
of
license
though
the
amount
of
details
required
is
somewhat
different.
but
on
both
of
those
the
broadcaster
has
been
asked
in
the
past
a
question
about
format.
and
at
one
time
there
was
a
question
there
that
asked
how
this
contributed
to
diversity?
that
second
question
has
been
eliminated
from
the
form
because
the
commission
thought
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
get
into
those
areas.
but
despite
the
existence
of
these
questions
on
the
form,
the
commission
has
never
gotten
into
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
format
should
be
abandoned
or
whether
a
broadcaster
should
be
required
to
continue
with
a
particular
format,
because
of
the
commission's
view
that
that
intrudes
very
much
in
the
area
of
program
content.
as
to
why
the
question
is
on
the
form,
i
think
one
needs
perhaps
to
understand
a
little
bit
of
the
history
of
it.
when
the
commission
first
got
into
business
of
applying
the
public
interest
standard,
there
were
many
fewer
broadcast
stations
than
there
are
today.
there
are
about
8,500
of
them
now,
of
which
i
think
about
1,000
are
public
stations.
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
at
the
time,
originally.
and
the
commission's
view
in
the
early
days
was
that...
and
this
was
the
view
of
broadcasters
also,
that
there
should
be
a
general
approach
to
programming,
and
they
had
various
categories
and
broadcasters
were
thought
to
pretty
much
have
the
same
programming
approach,
and
that
conformed
to
what
broadcasters
wanted
to
do
at
that
time.
part
of
the
implication
at
that
time
was
that
a
specialized
format
such
as
we
have
now
in
great
abundance
because
of
the
large
number
of
stations,
the
development
of
fm
and
so
on,
that
that
might
raise
special
public
interest
questions,
so
the
question
on
the
form
really
arose
because
the
commission
was
concerned
that
at
some
point
that
the
move
to
these
specialized
formats
and
away
from
a
more
general
programming
approach
might
itself
be
something
with
which
the
commission
should
concern
itself
i
think
the
commission,
based
on
the
present
experience
and
the
great
diversity
that
exists,
has
recognized
that
most
stations
now,
perhaps
90
percent
of
them,
have
these
specialized
formats,
and
it
really
has
determined
that
it
should
not
regulate.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
for
example,
wmal
i
think,
in
this
city,
might
be
viewed
by
some
people
as
having
a
more
general
programming
approach,
news,
music,
talk,
and
so
on.
but
most
of
the
stations
have
a
specialized
format,
whether
it
be
classical
or
rock
or
middle-of-the-road,
beautiful
music,
all
news;
there's
an
immense
variety
of
them,
depending
on
how
you
categorize
them.
there
could
be
said
to
be
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
different
formats.
and
it's
not
just
the
music
that's
played,
but
also
how
you
treat
the
news,
where
you
place
it,
the
style,
the
pace
of
the
station.
and
these
are
things
that
appeal
very
differently
to
different
members
of
the
audience,
so
that
someone
might
see
a
great
difference
between
one
station
which
classifies
itself
as
a
rock
station
and
another
station
which
also
may
classify
itself
as
a
rock
station,
but
the
sound
of
those
stations,
their
quality
and
their
approach,
may
be
very,
very
different
and
mean
very,
very
different
things
to
the
listener.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
commission
decision
not
to
regulate?
i
would
suppose
under
the
statute
it's
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
but
here
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
there's
no
specific
statutory
language
requiring
this
regulation,
where
there's
no
legislative
history
suggesting
that
the
commission
should
do
it.
and
indeed,
there
is
very
specific
legislative
history,
we
think,
suggesting
that
this
kind
of
a
qualitative
approach
to
programming,
whether
it
be
in
the
entertainment
area
or
the
news
area
or
any
other
area,
is
something
that
the
commission
is
not
supposed
to
do.
it's
not
supposed
to
set--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--pardon
me?
yes.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
it
as,
and
they
suggested
that
what
the
commission
was
doing
was
contrary
to
law.
i
think
we
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
find
in
the
statute
any
legal
requirement
that
the
commission
engage
in
this
very
kind
of
intrusive
regulation
where
the
first
amendment
and
the
statute
and
the
history
of
the
statute
and
the
policy
of
the
statute
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions
in
cbs
and
midwest
video
all
counsel
against
a
very
intrusive
kind
of
commission
regulation
that
would
be
involved
here.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
apparently
what
the
court
viewed
as
governing
here,
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
not.
no,
i
think
that
is
the
only
provision
that
they
could
rely
on,
and
it
is
the
only
provision
that
they
relied
on
here.
i
think
there
was
some
reference
to
some
other
general
portion
of
the
statute
in
one
of
the
other
earlier
decisions,
just
about
the
larger
use
of
radio
or
something
like
that,
but
that's
equally
general
and
this
court
in
nccb
suggested
that
that
is
not
a
ground
for
the
court
of
appeals
telling
the
commission
what
to
do.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that,
of
course,
is
not
a
question
that's
here.
but
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly,
no,
that
the
commission
could
not
have
adopted
that
kind
of
intrusive
regulation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
because
when
the
commission
gets
down
into
this
question
of
prohibiting
the
broadcaster
from
presenting
a
particular
kind
of
program,
as
this
court
recognized
in
red
lion,
as
this
court
recognized
in
pacifica
while
sustaining
the
particular
commission
ruling
there,
there
are
very
substantial
first
amendment
and
statutory
questions.
and
for
the
commission
to
get
into
this
area
of
regulation
would
require
it
to
make
the
most
elusive
and
subjective
kinds
of
judgments.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
both.
the
statutory
reason
relating
to
this
history
of
commission
regulation;
the
1927
act
where
congress
adopted
very
few
provisions
in
the
act
requiring
specific
regulation
of
programming;
section
315,
of
course;
section
1464,
which
was
involved
in
pacifica.
and
at
the
same
time
it
rejected
many,
many
other
proposals
to
require
more
intrusive
regulation
of
programming,
including
the
priorities
provision
which
i
had
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
a
provision
to
require
equal
time
for
the
discussion
of
public
issues,
provisions
to
prohibit
various
kinds
of
discrimination
against
programming.
and
the
congress
rejected
all
of
these,
and
instead
adopted
section
326
and
in
1934
adopted
section
3(h)
which
this
court
has
discussed
in
its
various
decisions.
and
in
order
to
avoid
these
constitutional
questions
one
looks
back
at
the
statute
and
finds
that
the
congress
was
deeply
concerned
about
commission
intrusion
into
program
content--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--my
argument,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is,
both.
that
the
commission
in
this
case
has
made
the
policy
judgment
not
to
intrude,
and
that
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
commission--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--specialized
format.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
it
would
not
and
it
could
not,
and
the
reason
that
it
would
not,
or
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
would
not
is
because
the
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
you
are
assuming
is
not
the
way
the
market
works.
it's
a
very
dynamic
market,
a
very
competitive
market,
it's
a
terribly
fragmented
market,
as
compared
to
television.
in
the
larger
cities
we
have
dozens
and
dozens
of
stations.
they
are
always
looking
for
a
new
programming
approach.
they
are
always
trying
to
innovate.
they
are
always
trying
to
get
a
larger
share
of
the
audience.
and
you
find
that
format
shifts
occur
constantly.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
commission
strongly
suggested
here
is
that
if
you
have
this
kind
of
intrusive
regulation,
that
broadcasters
would
be
very
reluctant
to
adopt
these
innovative
formats,
for
example,
the
all
news
format,
which
came
into
being
in
the
late
1960s.
many
people
and
commissioner
robinson
suggested
this
before.
many
people
believed
that
that
innovation
would
never
have
occurred
if
the
court
of
appeals
regulatory
regime
had
been
in
effect,
because
a
broadcaster
is
extremely
reluctant
to
get
himself
into
a
situation
where
he
adopts
an
innovative
format,
finds
that
it
does
not
work,
and
then
is
barred
from
changing
that
without
having
to
go
through
a
lengthy
and
expensive
hearing,
all
the
while,
perhaps,
losing
very,
very
substantial
amounts
of
money.
the
wefm
station
involved
in
one
of
these
earlier
cases
lost
about
$2
million
under
the
format
that
was
involved
in
that
case,
and
of
course
a
hearing
was
held
to
be
required
because
the
court
said,
well,
maybe
you
didn't
lose
the
$2
million
because
of
the
format,
maybe
you
lost
it
because
of
mismanagement
or
something
like
that.
so,
the
hearing
that
would
be
required
in
many,
many
of
these
cases
is
a
very
substantial
deterrent
to
a
broadcaster
who
is
thinking
of
changing
the
format.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it
would
not
hear
that
and
it
would
not
need
to
because
if
such
a
demand
existed
it
would
be
met
by
broadcasters
in
the
market.
we
find
in
a
number
of
these--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
for
example,
there
was
a
recent
change
in
new
york.
i
think
that
it
was,
the
call
letters
were
wrvr,
which
was
a
jazz
station,
which
changed
its
jazz
format
to
country
music,
and
almost
immediately
a
couple
of
other
stations
in
the
market
expanded
their
jazz
programming.
they
came
in
to
fill
that
gap.
there's
a
substantial
amount
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
sort
of
thing
happens.
if
someone
abandons
a
format
and
there
is
a
great
need
for
that
kind
of
programming,
a
great
demand
for
it,
someone
will
come
in
and
do
it.
but
the
problem
is
that
in
some
of
these
situations
where...
for
example,
in
the
atlanta
case,
the
voice
of
the
arts
in
atlanta,
a
case
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
they
relied
on
this
survey
that
purportedly
showed
that
16
percent
of
the
people
in
that
market
really
preferred
classical
music.
well,
there
were
lots
of
defects
to
that
survey.
but
the
major
defect
is
that
there
wasn't
anything
like
16
percent
of
the
people
listening
to
that
station.
it
was
less
than
one
percent.
if
16
percent
of
the
people
in
that
market
had
wanted
classical
music,
there
wouldn't
have
been
one
classical
music
station;
there
probably
would
have
been
three
of
them,
because
that's
an
enormous
market
share.
the
only
way
that
listener
preferences
can
really
be
determined
here
is
by
allowing
the
marketplace
to
work,
allowing
broadcasters
to
innovate
and
change,
based
on
their
hunches,
based
on
their
own
surveys
to
try
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
audience.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
would
be
going
a
little
far.
i
think
that
congress
obviously
contemplated
that
in
some
areas
the
commission
would
have
to
intervene.
since
1959,
i
assume,
or
when
congress
adopted
the
fairness
doctrine
as
part
of
the
statute,
that
that
is
one
of
those
areas,
and
one
of
the
parts
of
the
fairness
doctrine,
the
so-called
first
part
of
the
fairness
doctrine,
is
that
broadcasters
have
to
present
controversial
issue
programming.
so,
in
your
example
of
the
station
which
did
nothing
but
program
all
sports,
as
mr.
saylor
said,
that
probably
would
raise
an
issue
of
compliance
with
the
fairness
doctrine,
because
the
broadcaster
wouldn't
be
serving
the
public
by
total
absence
of
information
programs.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
a
specific
statutory
provision,
which
obviously
we
do
not
have
here.
and
i
think
that
the
commission
because
of
the
dynamism
of
the
radio
market
and
because
of
the
large
number
of
stations,
because
of
the
very
kinds
of
subjective
judgments
that
they
would
have
to
make
here,
was
correct
in
concluding
that
it
could
determine
not
to
impose
this
particular
kind
of
intrusive
regulation.
the
kinds
of
distinctions
that
would
have
been
required,
or
would
be
required
by
the
court
of
appeals'
regime,
are
terribly
subjective
between
fine
arts
stations
and
classical
stations,
between
contemporary
music
and
progressive
rock,
and
even
in
one
case
which
isn't
recorded
in
f.
2d...
it's
the
wono
case,
the
allegation
was
that
the
selections
that
the
broadcaster
was
choosing
were
incongruous
and
unadventurous.
and
the
court
said,
well,
you've
got
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
whether
under
those
circumstances
there's
a
unique
format
that's
been
abandoned
and
that
the
commission
should
raise
a
public
interest
question.
so
it's
those
kinds
of
very
intrusive
judgments
that
would
have
to
be
made
here.
now,
in
addition,
of
course,
to
the
specific
priorities
provision
that
was
deleted
from
the
statute,
the
congress,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
cbs
and
midwest
video,
decided
to
set
up
a
system
of
public
trusteeship
leaving
to
the
broadcaster,
by
and
large,
the
specific
programming
judgments.
and
just
as
this
court
in
the
cbs
case
said
that
to
require
a
general
system
of
access,
as
the
court,
the
same
court
has
required
there,
would
be
to
abandon
this
editorial
role
for
very
speculative
gains,
so
it
would
seem
here,
that
the
same
kind
of
speculative
gains
is
all
that
one
could
hope
from
the
regulatory
regime
which
the
court
of
appeals
would
impose,
and
as
the
commission
found,
the
gains
would
not
only
be
speculative,
but
there
would
be
this
very,
very
adverse
effect
on
innovation,
experimentation,
and
the
operation
of
the
marketplace.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
very
briefly,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
course
of
this
decade
of
decisions
was
extraordinarily
critical
of
the
commission
for
continually
resisting
its
policy.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes.
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
in
any
of
these
opinions
that
the
commission
had
departed
from
an
earlier
policy.
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
suggesting
is
that
the
commission
consistently
declined
to
adopt
the
policy--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
been
consistently
wrong.
and
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
couldn't
answer
that,
but
i
think
the
wefm
case,
for
example,
did
not
raise
the
statutory
issues
which
we've
been
urging,
or
the
constitutional
issues,
as
judge
bazelon,
i
think,
had
noted
in
his
separate
opinion
in
wefm.
so
i
think
it
is
quite
likely
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
commission
went
back
and
considered
these
issues
in
this
policy
proceeding
which
is
under
review
was
because
some
of
the
issues
hadn't
been
decided
by
the
commission
and
hadn't
been
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
earlier
case.
if
there's
nothing
else,
thank
you.
