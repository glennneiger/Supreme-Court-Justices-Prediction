mr.
robert
g.
parmley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
the
defendant's
argument,
i'd
like
to
elaborate
a
little
on
some
of
the
judicial
decisions
and
actions
in
this
case.
on
october
2nd,
1979,
approximately
one
year
after
the
trial
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
found
that
kleberg
county
was
mal-apportioned
and
in
the
october
2nd
order
the
district
court
informed
the
defendant
that
the
initial
burden
of
fashioning
the
constitutionally
acceptable
remedy
was
on
the
commissioners'
court,
the
district
court
quoting
wise,
then
advised
the
defendants
that
it
would
afford
them
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
meet
constitutional
requirements
by
adopting
a
substitute
measure
and
that
the
commissioners'
court
was
unwilling
or
unable
to
present
the
court
with
a
substitute
plan,
then
it
would
become
the
unwelcome
obligation
of
the
district
court
to
devise
its
own
plan.
the
district
court
then
directed
the
commissioners'
court
to
come
up
with
a
plan
and
a
hearing
was
set
on
that
plan
on
december
10,
1979,
approximately
60...
two
months
later.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
well
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
commissioners'
court
action
in
this
case
was
forbidden
by
state
law.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
whether
or
not
wise
would
have...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
i
think
the
district
court
was
aware
that
the
legislative
body
had
presented
a
plan
that
it
did
not
have
legislative
authority
to
present;
that
the
district
court
should
have
instructed
that
legislative
body
to
go
back
and
respond
to
its
duty
to
present
a
valid
substitute.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
well,
i
guess
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
can
defer
twice
to
the
legislative
body.
if
it's
only
given
one
shot,
then
i
would
say
if
it
came
forward
with
a
plan
that
was
invalid
under
state
law,
then
i
would
say
a
second
plan
would
not
be
afforded
legislative
deference
and
it
would
be
considered
as
any
other
plan
presented
by
a
party
to
the
lawsuit.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
yes
sir,
i
understand
that
position,
but
i
believe
that
legislative
history
will
show
that
a
correct
application
of
section
5
is
that
whenever...
when
the
legislative
body
has
received
a
judicial
deferral,
to
come
up
and
present
a
substitute
plan,
when
that
legislative
body
has
finalized
its
plan
which
incorporates
public
policy
objectives
and
is
preparing
to
submit
that
plan
to
the
district
court,
it
is
in
effect
seeking
to
administer
that
plan
through
incorporation
in
the
court's
order.
and
by
seeking
to
administer
that
plan,
by
incorporation
in
the
court's
order
it
falls
under
the
operational
language
of
section
5,
which
is
whenever
a
political
subdivision
seeks
to
administer
a
voting
change
then
that
change
must
be
precleared.
our
position
would
be
that
the
legislative
body
in
that
particular
case,
as
part
of
its
legislative
duty
to
come
forward
with
a
valid
plan,
would
have
had
to
have
section
5
preclearance.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
actually
had
legislative
authority
does
not
matter
because
although...
because,
the
plan
could
be
implemented
through
the
court
order.
operational
language
is
to
seek
to
administer,
it
doesn't
necessarily
require
that
they
have
to
enact
it.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
well,
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
supports
the
application
which
i
just
told
you,
that
in
fourteenth
amendment
cases,
where
there
is
a
violation
that
is
found
by
the
court...
at
the
1975
extension
hearings,
the
senate
judiciary
committee
report
specifically
stated
that
after
the
invalidation
of
a
plan
by
the...
and
legislative
deferment
the
court
should
defer
its
consideration
of
plans
presented
to
it
until
such
times
as
these
plans
have
been
submitted
for
section
5
review.
only
after
such
review
should
the
court
proceed
with
any
remaining--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--no,
your
honor.
my
reading
of
wise
is
that
the--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--or
invite
the
plaintiffs
to
submit
plans
and
that
may
be
an
incentive
for
the
legislative
body
to
come
up
with
their
own.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
that's
correct.
but
the
legislative
body
does
not
propose
a
plan--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
well
he
said
directed
but
he
also
said
he
was...
affording
them
an
equal
opportunity--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--well
i
think
it
could
order...
i
think
it
should
order
a
legislative
body
to
come
forward
with
a
plan.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
an
incentive
not
to
do
that
because
the
court
may
adopt
the
plaintiffs
plan,
and
i
don't
think
a
legislative
body
would
want
to
have
the
plaintiff's
plan
adopted,
but--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
but
it
was
submitted
at
the
trial
on
the
merits,
and
i
might
add
that
that
plan
did
not
split
election
precincts.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
yes
sir,
that's
so.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
no,
but
in
our
opinion,
the
plaintiffs
plan
tried
to
correct
that.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
the
court
yes,
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
dilution
in
mexican-american
voting
strength.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
well,
i
believe
they
could.
i
think
that's
what,
in
fact,
happened
in
burns
v.
richardson.
i
think
the
court
there
ordered
them
to
come
up
with
an
interim
plan
and
they
in
fact
did.
so
i
guess
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
they
can
order
them
to
come
up
with
a
legislative
plan.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
well
i
guess
they
could
put
them
in
contempt,
if
they
don't
follow
an
order,
it
seems
to
me
that
the--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--yes,
i
think
it
would
impose,
probably
an
interim
plan,
and
possibly
request
the
defendants
to
come
back
with
a
satisfactory
plan,...
if
that's
the
legislative
body--
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
--yes,
that's
correct.
the
district
court
could
do
that,
under
its
power.
in
relation
to
the
legislative
authority
of
the
commissioners'
court
redistrict,
there
is
an
authority
that
i
left
out
in
my
brief
that
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
that
is
an
opinion
from
the
texas
attorney
general.
that
opinion
is
opinion
number
m606,
and
the
facts
of
the
case
are
that
bailey
county,
texas
redistricted
their
commissioners'
court
precinct
lines
in
january
of
1970
and
in
the
process
of
redistricting
their
commissioners'
court
precinct
lines
they
split
election
precincts.
bailey
county
then
sent
a
letter
to
the
attorney
general
and
said
now
that
we've
split
election
precincts
can
we
conform
those
election
precincts
with
the
commissioners'
court
precincts?
and
the
attorney
general
responded
and
said
yes,
i
understand
your
situation,
you
did
split
the
election
precincts,
that's
fine.
but
you
cannot
now
conform
them;
you
have
to
wait
until
the
july
or
august
term
of
court.
i
have
a
copy
of
that
opinion
here
today
if
the
court
would
like
me
to
leave
it.
additionally
in
that
case
the
attorney
general
cited
the
various
articles
of
the
texas
election
code
and
the
texas
constitution
that
have
been
argued
back
and
forth
here
today.
the
attorney
general
also
cited
the
case
of
wilson
v.
weller,
which
the
petitioners
depended
on
for
their
support,
but
they
did
not
have
legislative
authority.
i
might
add
that
in
the
case
of
wilson
v.
weller,
that
involved
a
single
unitary
order
of
kleberg
county;
it
involved
the
same
county,
where
they
redistricted
commissioners'
court
precincts
and
election
precincts
at
the
same
time,
in
the
same
order.
and
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
they
could
not
redistrict
election
precincts,
although
they
could
redistrict
commissioners'
court
precincts
they
could
not
redistrict
election
precincts,
and
they
invalidated
that
part
of
the
order
in
reference
to
the
redistricting
of
the
election
precincts.
mr.
robert
g.
parmley
yes
sir.
