justice
jr.
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
burden
imposed
by
section
5
on
the
attorney
general?
how
many
applications
for
clearance
were
filed
last
year?
justice
jr.
in
the
sheffield
case,
that
was
here,
i
think
in
1978...
it
was
then
indicated
that
they
were
coming
in
at
about
the
rate
of
1000
a
year?
justice
jr.
and
that's
four
per
business
day,
approximately.
and
they
must
be
considered
and
acted
on
within
60
days.
how
much
time
per
application
at
the
rate
of
four
per
day
is
the
attorney
general
able
to
give
to
these
applications?
justice
jr.
then
many
of
the
applications
involve
multiple
changes?
justice
jr.
and
the
act
requires
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
his
personal
discretion.
justice
jr.
at
the
rate
of
four
a
day,
and
a
district
court
judge,
presumably,
spends
a
good
deal
more
time
on
questions
of
this
kind
than
the
a.
g.
could.
