justice
stevens
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
legislative
authority?
if,
because
the...
assuming
it
was
necessary
to
break
up
the
voting
precincts
in
order
to
satisfy
the
one-man-one-vote
requirement,
could
some
other
legislative
body
have
had
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
well
then,
if
there's
that
restriction
on
breaking
up
election
precincts
and
if
that
would
prevent
a
one-person-one-vote
satisfactory
response
would
it
not
necessarily
follow
that
that
restriction
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
stevens
well
but
it's
a
requirement
that
would
make
it
impossible
to
comply
with
the
equal
protection
clause
if
it
was
faithfully
followed,
isn't
that
what
you're--
justice
stevens
maybe
i
missed
something,
but
what
would
be
the
constitutional
objection
to
a
district
court
ordering
the
party
to
a
lawsuit
who
is
found
to
have
violated
the
law,
from
proposing
a
remedy?
i
don't
understand
why
there
would
be
any
constitutional
objection
to
such
an
order.
