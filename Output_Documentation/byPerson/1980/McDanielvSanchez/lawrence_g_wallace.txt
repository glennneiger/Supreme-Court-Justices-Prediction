mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
counsel
for
the
petitioners
has
correctly
stated
that
there
was
a
federal
presence
to
which
the
commissioners'
court
submitted
their
proposal
for
reapportionment,
but
that
was
wholly
apart
from
who
the
federal
presence
was.
the
district
court
did
not
purport
to
apply
the
standards
of
section
5,
did
not
make
any
inquiry
about
whether
there
was
a
retrogression
in
the
treatment
of
minority
voters
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
beer,
let
alone
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
covered
jurisdiction
that
it
would
have
to
sustain
under
section
5
in
proving
that
the
purpose
or
effect
is
not
to
discriminate.
the
question
before
the
court
is
really
a
narrow
question
of
statutory
interpretation
about
the
meaning
of
the
words
seek
to
administer.
in
section
5,
it's
a
question
that
the
court
has
found
recurringly
troublesome
in
trying
to
interrelate
section
5
with
reapportionment
litigation
and
there
is,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested,
a
need
for
as
much
clarification
as
possible
now,
with
all
the
reapportionments
that
will
be
resulting
from
the
1980
census.
for
the
interpretation
of
this
language
to
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
purpose,
it
is
crucial
in
our
view
that
two
very
serious
pitfalls
be
avoided.
one
is
to
avoid
an
interpretation
that
gives
jurisdictions
covered
by
section
5
a
dis-incentive
to
reapportion
themselves.
it
is
settled
by
this
court's
decisions
and
by
the
legislative
history
that
section
5
does
apply
to
reapportionments,
and
this
court
has
reiterated
time
and
again
that
reapportionment
is
principally
and
ideally,
a
legislative
function
and
that
legislative
bodies
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
undertake
to
do
the
reapportionment
on
their
own.
but
it's
always
easy
in
these
situations
for
a
legislature
to
do
nothing
and
to
hold
back
as
was
the
case
of
the
commissioner's
court
here
until
8
years
after
the
1970
census.
and
it's
not
uncommon
in
covered
jurisdictions
for
us
to
encounter
this
kind
of
holding
back
even
under
the
1970
census,
particularly
if
there's
hope
that
thereby
a
reapportionment
will
eventually
be
achieved
after
someone
brings
a
lawsuit
without
the
necessity
to
submit
the
legislature's
proposal
for
section
5
preclearance.
and
if
the
covered
jurisdiction
can
avoid
submitting
the
proposal
that
way
and
still
propose
it
to
the
reapportionment
court,
under
an
entitlement
to
deference
from
that
court
under
this
court's
decision
in
wise
v.
lipscomb,
the
deference
that
would
be
afforded
to
a
legislative
proposal.
then
the
way
is
open
it
seems
to
us,
to
widespread
evasion
of
this
court's
decision
in
georgia
v.
united
states;
that
the
protections
of
section
5
are
going
to
be
available
for
reapportionments
and
the
congressional
purpose
that's
been
strongly
stated
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
reenactments
of
section
5,
that
reapportionment
provides
a
special
danger
to
minority
voting
rights
and
it's
important
that
the
protection
be
afforded.
now
this
brings
me
to
the
second
interrelated
pitfall
that
it
is
very
important
to
avoid,
and
that
is
creation
of
a
gap
or
a
loophole
in
the
protection
afforded
by
one
or
the
other
of
two
lines
of
decisions
of
this
court.
one
of
those
lines
of
decisions
holds
that
efforts
by
covered
jurisdictions
to
reapportion
themselves
must
be
precleared
even
if
those
efforts
occur
in
the
course
of
reapportionment
or
other
voting
right
litigation,
that
is,
connor
v.
waller
and
related
writings
in
other
cases.
and
the
second
line
of
decisions
is
that
judicially
imposed
reapportionments
need
not
be
precleared,
but
they
are
subject
to
special
remedial
standards
and
those
standards
are
protective
of
minority
voting
rights
in
the
application,
even
though
they
are
not
identical
to
section
5.
and
our
principle
submission
is
that
the
standards
for
what
is
a
legislative
plan
and
what
is
a
court-imposed
plan
should
be
the
same
for
purposes
of
both
of
these
lines
of
decisions.
the
court's
opinions
have
assumed
that
the
standard
is
the
same--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
right.
the
substantive
standards
are
the
same,
but
in
defining
what
is
a
court-ordered
plan
and
what
is
a
legislative
plan,
as
we've
set
out
on
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief,
opinions
of
this
court
have
assumed
that
you
arrive
at
the
same
answer
for
both
purposes
and
congress
has
certainly
operated
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
not
going
to
be
a
gap
in
protection,
whereby
in
a
covered
jurisdiction
the
reapportionment
can
occur
without
either
protection
being
afforded
minority
voting
rights,
and
so
our
proposed
solution,
the
interpretation
that
we
espouse
and
that
mr.
parmley
was
espousing
is
one
that
we
have
proposed
to
the
court
before.
but
happily,
it's
one
that
is
consistent
as
we
see
it
with
the
statutory
language
and
with
the
legislative
history
to
the
extent
that
that
legislative
history
specifically
addresses
this
question
and
it
does,
in
the
1975
senate
report.
and
that
is
that
seeks
to
administer
does
embrace
a
proposal
by
the
covered
jurisdiction
to
a
reapportionment
court,
that
that
court
order
into
effect
the
reapportionment
plan
that
the
covered
jurisdiction
is
in
the
course
of
litigation
proposing.
we
don't
think
that
this
really
should
turn
on
the
niceties
of
state
law,
about
whether
there
is
some
limitation
in
the
authority
of
the
covered
jurisdiction's
body
making
the
proposal
to
have
enacted
this
change
on
its
own
in
the
absence
of
the
reapportionment
litigation.
this
would
raise
many
uncertainties
about
the
coverage
and
difficult
questions
of
state
law
to
be
resolved
in
federal
court
which
have
no
particular
expertise
about
them,
but
the
result
either
way
would
be
that
the
covered
jurisdiction
would
be
seeking,
through
the
approval
of
the
reapportionment
court
to
administer
a
new
apportionment,
precise--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
act
with
whatever
other
assistance
can
be
made
available.
the
plaintiffs
propose
two
plans
here,
and
dr.
nash
or
or
other
experts
might
have
been
available
and
a
court
ordered
plan
would
then
have
to
comply
with
the
special
remedial
standards
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--this
court
has
prescribed
for
court-ordered
plans.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
quite
say
any
kind
of
a
response--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
proposes
a
plan,
a
proposal
of
a
covered
jurisdiction
to
the
reapportionment
court
that
this
is
what
we'd
like
to
put
into
effect
as
our
new
apportionment
raises
the
problem
that
congress
was
applying
section
5
to
assure
protection.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
all
of
that
may
be
much
more
desirable
as
a
matter
of
state
practice
and
state
law
for
them
to
do
it
in
an
open
way
and
in
a
way
that
they
would
ordinarily
reapportion
themselves.
but
there
are
many
changes
that
a
covered
jurisdiction
seeks
to
administer
without
the
enactment
of
legislation,
which
have
to
be
precleared.
there
are
many
election
officials
who
have
authority
to
change
election
precincts,
there
are
other
steps
that
are
taken
and
changes
in
the
election
law
which
do
not
require
specific
legislation;
they
are
done
under
a
general
grant
of
enabling
legislation,
and
it's
not
unusual
for
submissions
to
be
made...
or
changes
if
the
covered
jurisdiction
is
seeking
to
administer
that
don't
amount
to
legislation.
it's
only
in
this
one
area
that
a
question
has
been
raised
by
this
court's
opinion
about
whether
something
that
falls
short
of
legislation
is
something
that
the
covered
jurisdiction
is
not
seeking
to
administer
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
if
the
jurisdiction
does
not
respond
to
the
district
court's
invitation
to
them,
to
submit
a
proposal
that
the
district
court
should
put
into
effect
on
an
interim
basis
hopefully,
until
there
is
actual
legislation
enacted.
if
the
jurisdiction
does
not
respond
to
that,
then
the
district
court
has
no
choice
but
to
go
ahead
and
remedy
the
constitutional
violation
without
whatever
help
it
can
get
from
other
parties
to
the
litigation--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
we
don't
see
how
the
language
of
the
statute
can
be
interpreted
to
say
that
the
covered
jurisdiction
in
that
circumstance
is
seeking
to
administer
a
plan,
and
it's
only
if
the
covered
jurisdiction
in
answer
seeks
to
administer
a
plan
that
preclearance
is
required
for
what
the
covered
jurisdiction
is
undertaking
to
do.
it's
not
the
court
order
that
would
be
precleared.
it's
supposed
to
be
precleared
before
the
court
considers
it,
and
the
regulations--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
the
attorney
general
qualify
for
expedited
consideration--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
if
they
did
subsequently
have
an
enactment--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--replicating
the
court's
plan,
that
enactment
would,
under
connor
v.
waller,
have
to
be
submitted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
felt
that
they
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
actually
administer
the
plan,
but
if
they
are
just
doing
it
under
the
court's
order,
our
view
has
been
that
that
is
not
subject
to
preclearance.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
meaning
of
connor
v.
johnson,
that
the
court's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--order
is
not
to
be
precleared.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
senate
committee
report,
in
1975,
that
there
would
be
preclearance
even
then.
and
you
know,
obviously,
the
full
protection
of
section
5
might
not
be
available
in
that
situation
without
preclearance,
however
there
is
considerable
protection
for
minority
voting
interests
in
the
remedial
standards
that
this
court
has
developed
for
court
ordered
plans
and
it
perhaps
would
not
be
amiss
to
say
in
covered
jurisdictions,
the
court
in
ordering
such
a
plan
into
effect
also
should
consider
whether
there
would
be
a
retrogressive
effect,
such
as
the
court
spoke
of
in
beer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
sure
the
number
is
very
large,
mr.
justice,
but
i
don't
have
it
at
my
fingertips.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there
is
a
considerable
staff
that
works
on
these
matters.
many
of
the
applications
are
very
routine
changes
that
are
precleared
without
much
problem,
and
about
99
percent
of
them
are
precleared.
however,
that's
not
true
of
apportionments...
reapportionments--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--some
of
them
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has,
for
the
most
part,
delegated
that
authority
to
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
civil
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
certainly
does,
mr.
justice,
but...
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
onset,
he
is
not
applying
the
same
standards,
he's
not
making
the
same
inquiry
at
all,
even
though
he's
spending
more
time,
nobody
has
made
the
inquiry
if
that's
the
only
inquiry
made.
the
inquiry
that
section
5
was
designed
to
have
made
about
whether
there's
a
retrogressive
effect
on
minority
voting
rights.
