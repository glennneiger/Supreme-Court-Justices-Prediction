mr.
richard
a.
hall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
which
presents
the
question
of
whether
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
which
is
42
u.s.c.
1973c,
requires
the
pre-clearance
of
a
county
reapportionment
plan
which
was
prepared
after
a
trial
at
the
court's
direction,
after
a
previous
plan
had
been
invalidated,
and
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
upon
the
use
of
the
proposed
plan.
and
when
the
plan
that
was
newly
completed
was
declared
by
the
trial
court
to
be
one
which
should
be
used
for
the
1980
elections.
the
original
lawsuit
was
brought
alleging
an
existing
districting
plan
for
four
commissioners'
precincts
of
kleberg
county
to
be
unconstitutional
first
because
the
existing
plan
diluted
the
vote
of
the
mexican-american
residents
of
the
county,
and
secondly
because
it
violated
the
one-man-one-vote
principle
of
the
constitution.
the
trial
of
the
case
was
devoted
primarily
to
the
first
question;
that
is,
whether
the
existing
plan
diluted
the
voting
strength
of
mexican-american
residents.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
the
trial
court
held
that
there
had
been
no
dilution
of
mexican-american
voting
strength
but
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
one-man-one-vote
principle
and
ordered
that
the
county
prepare
a
new
plan
and
submit
it
to
the
court
for
consideration.
the
trial
court
set
a
hearing
date
on
the
new
plan,
the
parties
appeared
at
that
time...
and
incidentally,
this
was
a
class
action
brought
by
mexican-american
residents
of
kleberg
county.
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
plan,
the
trial
court
heard
evidence
as
to
the
statistical
results
and
also
heard
questions
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
the
new
plan
on
the
voting
strength
of
mexican-americans,
how
mexican-american
residents
and
voters
had
been
affected
by
the
particular
plan
that
was
presented.
the
plan
was
actually
prepared
by
a
professor
from
texas
a
&
i
university,
whose
sole
objective
was
to
achieve
an
equality
in
number
between
the
four
precincts.
he
was
instructed
however,
on
one
occasion,
that
the
county
would
prefer
that
a
boundary
line
be
withdrawn
to
include
the
courthouse
in
commissioners'
precinct
number
1,
he
was
also
asked
to
try
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
existing
voting
or
election
precincts,
rather
than
to
divide
them
up.
he
accomplished
all
this,
although
he
did
have
to
divide
or
split
a
number
of
voting
precincts.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
is
an
action
which
could
only
be
taken
by
the
commissioners'
court
in
july
or
august
of
a
given
year
and
it
was
not
done
in
the
texas
court...
it
was
not
done
in
that
time-period
and
the
texas
courts
have
held
that
a
commissioners'
court,
itself,
is
absolutely
precluded
from
making
a
division
of
commissioners'
precincts
other
than
at
the
stated
time,
and
that
is--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--i
know
they
do,
your
honor,
but
i
disagree
with
my
opposition,
because
i
think
that
the
case
of
wilson
v.
weller
makes
it
very
clear,
both
in
its
holding
and
its
distinguishing
of
another
texas
supreme
court
case
that
where
in
fact
election
precincts...
and
we're
not
talking
about
commissioners'
precincts
at
this
point,
we're
talking
about
election
precincts,
when
election
precincts
are
divided,
or
the
boundaries
are
re-drawn...
it
can
only
be
done
in
july
or
august
and
at
no
other
time.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
factor
in
this
lawsuit
simply
because
of
this
court's
holding
in
east
carroll
parish
v.
marshall,
in
which
the
fact
that
a
louisiana
police
jury
had
no
authority
to
reapportion
itself
pursuant
to
an
enabling
statute
which
had
been
questioned
by
the
attorney
general
was
suggested
to
be
dispositive
of
the
question
whether
the
particular
plan
was
a
court-ordered
plan
or
was
a
legislative
plan.
in
any
event,
the
trial
court
did
review
the
plan
and
in
its
order
stated
that
he
had
considered
the
plaintiff's
objections
to
the
plan
as
well,
and
the
plaintiff
did
come
forward
with
evidence
challenging
the
proposed
plan
on
the
basis
that
it
did
dilute
mexican-american
voting
strength.
the
court
concluded
that
the
plan
was
acceptable
and
ordered
that
it
should
be
used
in
1980.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
no,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
not.
and
following
his
approval
of
the
plan,
there
followed
a
series
of
procedural
steps
which
resulted
in
the
fifth
circuit's
summary
determination
that
the
plan
could
not
be
used
and
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
or
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
preclearance
under
the
voting
rights
act
before
it
could
be
put
into
effect.
and
of
course,
that
raises
the
question
presented...
the
question
presented
here,
whether
a
plan
conceived
as
this
one
was,
in
the
course
of
litigation
which
had
been
long
since
commenced
was
required
to
be
submitted
for
section
5
preclearance
or
whether
the
district
court
could
order
such
a
plan
into
effect
without
preclearance.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
we
did
in
a
motion
for
rehearing,
your
honor.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
question
was
presented
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
series
of
briefs
that
were
directed
toward
a
summary
reversal
of
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
well
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
legislative
responsibilities
of
which
the
fifth
circuit
was
speaking
was...
a
one
to
which
this
court
has
addressed
so
many
times,
and
that
is
simply
the
preparation
of
a
plan
or
the
submission
of
a
plan
at
the
direction
of
the
trial
court
rather
than
the
preparation
of
that
plan
by
the
trial
court
itself.
i
think
that's
the
fulfillment
of
legislative
duty
which
is
suggested.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
a.
hall
well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
suppose
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
speaking
to
there,
but
i
think
that
all
the
fifth
circuit
was
saying
was
that
this
was
not
a
plan
which
was
a
court-ordered
plan;
it
was
not
a
plan
which
was
prepared
judicially
it
was
prepared
judicially
it
was
prepared
legislatively,
in
the
sense
that
the
trial
court
told
the
county,
one
of
the
parties,
to
go
out
and
prepare
and
return
with
a
plan
and
the
county
did
return
with
a
plan
and
the
county
did
return
with
a
plan
and
in
that
sense
it
was
a
legislative
plan.
in
that
sense
only,
it
was
not
a
plan--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--it
would
be
an
order
of
commissioners'
court--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--well,
in
truth,
your
honor,
that
is
what
is
done
with
the
exception
that
the
trial
court
did
not
tell
the
commissioners'
court
to
go
reapportion
itself
and--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--they
said
submit
a
new
plan
to
the
court,
not
go
out
and
prepare
one
and
adopt
it
and
follow
such
procedures
as
might
be
appropriate
if
you
were
not
in
the
middle
of
a
suit
challenging
the
constitutionality
xx
exist
xx
plan.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
no,
your
honor.
the
commissioners'
court
would
have
had
the
power
to
reapportion
itself
into
four
commissioners'
precincts.
the
texas
constitution
says
that
it
may
do
so
from
time
to
time
as
it
deems
appropriate.
so
there's
no
question
about
its
power
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
it
could
have
complied
with
that.
the
question
is
whether
it
could
have
achieved
a
satisfactory
one-man-one-vote
result
without
dividing
election
precincts.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
well,
truthfully
that
question
was
not
litigated,
and
i
know
it
is
raised
by
the
respondent,
your
honor,
but
the
answer
is
it
would
not
have
had
the
power
to
do
it
in
the
abstract,
if
there
had
been
no
lawsuit,
the
commissioners'
court
would
not
have
had
the
power
under
texas
law
to
redrawn
its
commissioner
precinct
lines
if,
in
order
to
do
that,
it
had
to
split
some
existing
election
precinct
lines.
you
see,
a
commissioners'
precinct
might
be
made
up
of
6
or
8
election
precincts
which
are
subdivisioned
within
the
commissioners'
precinct.
and
what
i
understand
the
state
statute
to
prohibit
is
the
dividing
or
splitting
of
one
of
those
sub-divisions,
one
of
those
election
precincts,
at
any
time
other
than
in
july
or
august.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
if
that--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--that
would
be
true.
if
the
county
had
come
back
with
any
excuse,
which
amounted
to
a
refusal
to
do
it--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--that's
true.
it
said
it
was
unable
to
do
it,
it
just
wasn't
physically
possible,
as
in
this
case
it
might,
it
could
have
come
back
and
said
it's
too
late
we're
almost
to
the
1980
elections--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--it's
a
legitimate
argument,
your
honor,
but
in
all
candor,
that's
not
really
what
i
am
saying,
because
i
understand
you
to
be
asking
me
whether
it
would
have
been
physically
possible
to
come
up
with
some
other
plan
which
would
have
achieved
the
one-man-one-vote
result
that
was
desired
without
splitting
any
of
the
sub-precincts,
these
election
precincts.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
sir?
mr.
richard
a.
hall
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
or
not.
i
know
that
the
respondent--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--that's
true.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
case.
the
commissioners'
court
would
have
had
the
authority
to
change
the
commissioners'
precinct
line,
but
not
if
in
order
to
achieve
one-man-one-vote
balance
they
had
also
had
to
split
or
divide
some
of
these
voting
precincts,
if
in
order
to
get
the
right
number
of
people
in
each
of
the
four
commissioners'
precincts
it
had
been
necessary
for
the
commissioners'
court
to
break
up
an
existing
voting
precinct...
to
say,
okay,
part
of
you
who
voted
in
voting
precinct
21
are
now
going
to
be
in
a
different
precinct...
if
they
had
had
to
do
that
they
would
have
been
without
authority
to
do
it
under
the
texas
decision,
but
if
they
had
not
been
required
to
vote,
to
change
voting
precincts,
to
alter
the
boundaries
of
those,
then
it
would
have
been
within
their
power
to
make
the
change.
in
any
event,
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
the
plan
which
had
been
submitted
to
the
trial
court
and
which
had
been
approved
by
the
trial
court
could
not
be
used
because
it
had
not
been
precleared
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
directed
that
the
trial
court...
and
held
that
the
trial
court
should
not
have
considered
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
plan
before
it
had
been
precleared,
remanded
the
case,
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed...
and
that
brings
us
to
this
moment.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
the
question
has
arisen.
the
only
authority
i
am
going
on
is
article
2.041
of
the
texas
statutes,
which
simply
provides
that
the
election
voting
precincts
may
not
be
altered
other
than
by
the
commissioners'
court...
other
than
july
or
august.
and
there
is
no
other
authority
in
texas
of
which
i
am
aware,
that
would
have
the
power
to
alter
election
precincts
other
than
in
july
or
august.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
i
haven't
had
the
question,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
or
not.
i
don't
really
see
why
that's
not
a
reasonable
requirement--
mr.
richard
a.
hall
--no,
not
really,
because
in
any
july
or
august
the
commissioners'
court
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that
and
the
problem
is
simply
one
of
timing
with
respect
to
an
upcoming
election.
the
legislature
in
texas
has
simply
said
we
don't
want
the
commissioners'
court
doing
a
lot
of
changing
of
voting
precincts
any
closer
to
an
upcoming
election
than
july
or
august
and
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
provision
by
the
state
legislature.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
i
suspect,
your
honor,
that...
i
don't
know
why
at
the
particular
time,
i
suspect
that
almost
any
change
could
run
afoul
of
the
primary
and
general
election
problems
that
we
have
in
texas.
generally
speaking,
primary
elections
are
held
in
may
and
the
general
election
in
november,
and
i
don't...
i
don't
suppose
that...
well
a
change
even
in
july
or
august
in
an
election
year
would
alter
the
voting
pattern
or
the
place
of
votes
between
the
date
of
the
primary
and
of
the
general
elections.
so
i
can't
answer
your
question.
i
don't
know
why
that
particular
restriction,
i
don't
know...
it's
not
been
challenged,
that
i'm
aware
of,
on
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
for
as
long
as
i
can
recall,
it
has
been
held
in
may
and
the
court
may
be
correct
about
that.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
all
right,
sir.
in
any
event,
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
brings
us
here
and
we
have
a
number
of
reasons
for
believing
that
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
as
it
relates
to
preclearance
should
not
be
applicable
in
a
case
which
is
already
in
a
federal
district
court
and
already
subject
to
constitutional
scrutiny.
the
first
reason
for
this
is
that
as
we
view
the
voting
rights
act,
it
assumes
the
existence
and
the
continuation
of
an
existing
plan,
both
the
legislative
history
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
referred
to
the
effect
of
the
plan...
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
section
5
as
in
effect,
freezing
into
use
and
existence
an
existing
plan,
and
if
that
were
the
case
there
would
be
no
problem
or
hardship
so
far
as
the
election
process
in
the
county
is
concerned
because
it
would,
as
it
went
through
the
machinery
prescribed
by
the
voting
rights
act,
have
an
existing
plan
that
could
be
used
during
the
time
required
for
that
procedure.
but
that
is
not
the
case
where
the
catalyst
for
the
presentation
of
a
new
plan
is
an
order
of
a
federal
court
striking
down
the
old
plan,
there
is
no
plan
then
to
be
frozen
into
effect
and
there
is
no
plan
prepared
or
participated
in
by
the
local,
political
subdivisions
which
can
be
utilized
during
the
interim.
we
also
think
that
the
language
of
the
voting
rights
act
which
speaks
to
changes
in
procedure
which
a
subdivision,
political
subdivision
"enacts
or
seeks
to
administer"
is
not
simply
fortuitous
language;
we
think
that
the
legislature
meant
what
it
said,
that
it
was
speaking
of
changes
that
were
voluntarily
undertaken
by
a
political
subdivision,
that
is,
the
political
subdivision
enacted
or
sought
to
administer
a
particular
plan
which
was
different
from
the
one
that
had
existed
before
and
which
had
been
frozen
into
effect.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
commissioners'
court
enacted
or
sought
to
administer
a
new
plan,
it
did
neither.
it
was
told
by
the
trial
court
it
could
not
use
its
old
plan
and
that
it
should
submit
a
new
plan.
so,
for
that
reason
also,
we
think
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
apply
in
a
case
involving
these
circumstances.
third,
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
speak
to
the
purpose
of
insuring
that
there
is
a
federal
presence
in
the
formulation
of
any
plan
which
is
different
from
the
one
which
had
been
frozen
into
effect
by
the
voting
rights
act.
and
we
have
a
federal
presence
in
this
case,
very
much
so;
we
have
the
most
intense
federal
presence
that
you
could
imagine,
in
the
discarding
of
the
old
plan
and
the
formulation
of
the
new
plan.
we
had
a
federal
district
judge
in
corpus
christi,
texas,
one
county
over
from
kleberg
county,
that
was
aware
of
all
the
facts.
he
had
already
listened
in
detail
to
the
plaintiff's
class
action
challenge
of
the
existing
plan,
he
knew
intimately
what
the
circumstances
and
background
were.
and
there
was
no
better
forum
anywhere
to
consider
the
changes
which
were
proposed
than
the
local
federal
district
court.
so
that
objective
of
the
voting
rights
act,
we
think,
has
been
squarely
met
in
the
case
of
a
plan
which
is
presented
following
the
striking
down
of
an
existing
plan
by
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
well
that,
i'm
sure
is
the
argument
in
support
of
the
applicability
of
the
voting
rights
act,
your
honor,
but
certainly
the
legislative
history
didn't
speak
to
that.
it
does...
it
does
speak
to
the
existence
of
a
body
of
expertise,
and
uniformity
that
is
sought
by
channeling
all
of
these
decisions
through
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
but
for
the
life
of
me,
i
don't
see
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
no
disparagement
intended,
has
any
greater
expertise
in
a
case
of
this
type
where
a
local
federal
district
court
has
already
considered
in
great
detail
in
an
adversary
proceeding,
the
various
factors
which
would
affect
the
formulation
of
a
new
claim.
and
finally,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
contemplate
the
existence
of
a
pending
suit
which
already
raises
constitutional
issues
which
the...
with
which
the
local
federal
court
has
grappled.
and
that
is
perhaps
a
different
facet
of
the
suggestion
that
where
you
do
have
a
federal
presence
already
involved
with
a
lawsuit
there
is
no
occasion
to
seek
further
federal
presence
in
the
form
of
an
attorney
general
or
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
decision,
we
think,
of
the
fifth
circuit
ignores
completely
this
court's
decision
in
east
carroll
parish
school
board
v.
marshall,
in
which,
in
virtually
identical
situation,
the
question
was
raised
in
an
amicus
curiae
brief
by
the
united
states
and
in
which
this
court
said
that
section
5
preclearance
was
not
required
in
the
case
of
a
plan
which
was
prepared
at
the
instance
of
a
federal
district
court
and
submitted
to
a
federal
district
court.
the...
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
see
more
problems
with
requiring
preclearance
of
a
plan
conceived
in
the
course
of
existing
district
court
litigation,
than
i
do
in,
in
not
requiring
preclearance.
first
of
these,
of
course,
is
the
tremendous
delay
and
expense
incident
to
a
preclearance
procedure
when
you
already
have
a
pending
lawsuit
in
a
local
district
court.
as
i
understand
those
cases,
in
which
the
question
might
be
raised
and
as
i
understand
the
voting
rights
act,
if
the
trial
court
were
required
in
this
case
to
remand
the
county
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
district
court
of
columbia,
the
county
could
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
proceed
back
and
forth
until
a
plan
had
been
approved
there
or
disapproved.
it
could
then,
if
it
were
disapproved,
it
could
go
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia;
i
assume
an
appeal
could
follow
that,
and
then,
the
case
could
go
back
to
the
trial
court
where,
by
the
express
terms
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
question
of
constitutionality
could
be
litigated.
and
if
the
trial
court
should
determine
at
that
point
that
the
plan
was
unconstitutional
although
it
didn't
violate
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act,
we
would
start,
i
gather,
all
over
on
this
procedure.
and
i
think
that
is
a...
i
think
that
defeats
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
i
think
it...
it
insures
a
multiplicity
of
litigations
and
perhaps
harm
to
the
voters
themselves.
i
can
conceive
that
a
political
subdivision
which
does
not
wish
to
get
right
on
with
a
new
plan
could
perpetuate
its
own
unconstitutionally
elected
officials
in
office
indeterminately
by
playing
the
game
of
proceeding
to
the
attorney
general,
of
submitting
half-hearted
plans
and
so
forth.
and
i
realize
the
answer
to
that
is,
well
the
trial
court
could
prepare
his
own
plan
and
order
it
into
effect.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
that
point
we
would
come
back
to
the
question
then
of
why
it
should
be
that
a
district
court
plan
is
not
subject
to
section
5
preclearance,
why
the
district
court
has
sufficient
ability
and
expertise
to
prepare
its
own
plan,
but
not
to
review
a
plan
prepared
or
submitted
by
a
local
political
subdivision.
we
think
everything
about
the
voting
rights
act
and
everything
that
relates
to
the
question
of
preclearance
is
directed
towards
voluntarily
undertaken
changes
in
voting
procedures
and
not
the
one
which
is
taking
place
under
the
scrutiny
of
federal
court.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
hall
i'll
speak
quickly,
your
honor.
if
there
were
ever
a
disincentive
to
reapportionment
it
seems
to
me
that
the
scheme
proposed
by
the
respondents
would
provide
that
disincentive.
why
on
earth
would
a
county
submit
a
plan
to
a
district
court
for
approval?
why
would
it
give
the
district
court
any
assistance
at
all?
if
it
knew
that
if
it
were
lucky
enough
to
submit
a
good
plan,
one
to
be
accepted,
it
was
then
going
to
be
sent
off
to
the
attorney
general,
to
the
district
of
columbia,
perhaps,
and
then
come
back
for
a
subsequent
challenge
on
constitutionality
by
anyone
who
wanted
to
make
it,
when
the
opposite
choice
would
be
to
submit
no
plan
at
all
or
perhaps
submit
one
that
was
very
artfully
deficient,
that
perhaps
even
the
local
federal
judge
could
perceive
the
shortcoming
in,
let
him
make
the
correction
and
then
it's
his
plan
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
i
think
this
proposal
that
the
united
states
makes
would
just
compound
the
problems
of
our
federal
courts
and
our
political
subdivisions.
