justice
white
did
you
argue
to
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
commissioners'
court
didn't
have
power
to
reapportion
itself
in
accordance
with
this
plan?
justice
white
well
because
the
per
curiam
in
the
court
of
appeals
says
"by
submitting
a
proposed
reapportionment
plan
to
the
district
court,
the
kleberg
county
commissioners'
court
complied
with
and
fulfilled
its
legislative
responsibilities.
"
justice
white
that
isn't
quite
what
this
language
says,
is
it?
justice
white
that
isn't
quite
what
this
language
says;
you're
saying...
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
party
to
a
lawsuit
was
asked
to
submit
a
plan
and
it
did.
the
court
of
appeals
says
it
did
it
legislatively.
justice
white
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
court
had
simply
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
invalidating
the
old
plan
and
giving
the
commissioners'
court
a
certain
time
to
come
up
with
a
new
ordinance
or
whatever...
what
is
it
you
called
it,
an
ordinance,
or--
justice
white
--an
order,
yes.
if
that's
all
the
court
had
done...
we'll
give
you
time,
like
courts
usually
do,
to
reapportion
yourself.
justice
white
it
said...
submit
a
new
plan,
that's
what
they
said.
justice
white
well
xx
that
in
order
to
comply
with
the
court's
view
of
what
was
wrong
with
the
old
plan,
that
the
commissioners'
court
would
not
have
the
power
under
your
view
of
their
power,
to
reapportion
themselves
constitutionally?
in
that
they
wouldn't
have
the
power
at
this
time
to
split
precincts?
justice
white
so
it
could
have
complied
with
the
constitutional
requirements
on
its
own?
justice
white
well
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
would
it
have
had
the
power
to
bring
itself
into
compliance
with
the
one-man-one-vote
requirement?
justice
white
so
if
the
commissioners'
court
had
responded
to
the
court
by
saying
in
order
to
satisfy
you
we
would
have
to
exceed
our
powers
and
we
just
can't,
we
just
are
forbidden
to
propose
the
plan?
justice
white
then
the
court
would
have
had
to
draw
up
its
own
plan,
i
suppose.
and
that
clearly
wouldn't
have
been
subject
to
clearance,
preclearance.
justice
white
or
a
claim
of
inability?
justice
white
well
you,
in
essence
claim
that
they
were
forbidden
under
state
law
to
give
a
legislative
response
to
the
court's
request,
which
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
argument.
justice
white
and
you
think
it
wasn't?
justice
white
you
don't
think
it
was
possible?
justice
white
well
if
it
was
impossible,
the
commissioners'
court
wouldn't
have
had
the
power
to
achieve
it.
justice
white
suppose
it
was,
then
answer
justice
rehnquist's
question.
justice
white
well
mr.
parmley,
what
if
in
this
case
the
commissioners'
court
had
said
judge,
we
just
don't
want
to
come
up
with
a
plan
and...
it's
too
difficult
and
we
don't
think
we
have
the
authority
and
even
if
we
did,
we
just
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
old
one
is
bad,
we're
going
to
appeal
and
meanwhile,
the...
if
you
want
to
put
in
your
own,
fine,
go
ahead.
you
don't
think
the
judge
would
have
held
the
commissioners'
court
in
contempt,
do
you?
do
you
think
the
court
has
authority
to
order
the
submission
of
a
new
plan?
it
can
give
the
legislative
body
time
to
submit
a
new
plan,
do
you
think
they
can
order
it
and
enforce
that
order?
justice
white
well
what
if...
what
then
if
the
commissioners'
court
just
sits
on
its
hands
as
justice
rehnquist
says,
and
once
the
declaratory
judgment
is
issued
it
just
doesn't
do
anything.
the
court
then
is
going
to
prepare
its
own
plan,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well
it
may
be,
but
if
they
don't,
then...
and
the
court
puts
in
its
own
plan,
then
under
our...
unless
we
overrule
our
cases,
the
court
plan
isn't
subject
to
preclearance,
is
it?
justice
white
so
it
may
be
that
we're
not
arguing
about
much
here,
in
the
sense
that
a
commissioners'
court
could
just...
or
any
legislative
body
after
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
an
old
plan
is
just
going...
it
doesn't
want
to
preclear,
it
just
isn't
going
to
submit
a
plan.
of
course,
a
lot
of
legislative
bodies
would
rather
have
their
own
plan
in
than
a
court's
plan.
but
nevertheless,
there
is
a
way
of
avoiding
preclearance,
apparently.
well
if
he's...
if
you're...
if
he's
right.
here,
the
district
court
used
the
word
directed;
with
that
in
mind,
the
defendants
are
hereby
directed
to
submit
a
proposed
new
plan
by
the
13th
day
of
november,
1979.
do
you
think
that
that
should
be
read
as
requested?
justice
white
you
mean
an
entire
state
legislature
as
in
burns?
well
that's
an
issue
that
we
don't
have
directly.
well
what
happens
to
the
county
in
the
meantime
then?
how
is
it
governed
if
the...
if
the
prior
statute
it
had
was
bad
or
the
ordinance
it
had
was
bad,
and
the
court
is
not
satisfied
with
the
plan
proposed
by
the
defendant,
it
is
unwilling
to
adopt
the
plaintiff's
plan,
doesn't
it
have
to
simply
impose
a
plan
of
its
own?
justice
white
well
under
our
cases,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
reversible
error
if
pending
a
new
plan
the
old
plan
stayed
in
use.
even
the
unconstitutional
one,
we've
sustained
that.
justice
white
well,
mr.
wallace,
what
if
the
commissioner's
court
said
that
judge,
we
just
aren't
able
to
come
up
with
a
plan
and
we
know
you...
we
disagree
with
our
old
one
and
we're
going
to
appeal,
but
meanwhile,
we
can't
get
together
on
a
plan
and
don't
propose
to
submit
one?
and
then
the
court
gets
dr.
nash,
or
professor
nash,
and...
the
plaintiffs...
and
he
puts
in
a
plan
of
his
own?
justice
white
but
if
a--
justice
white
--but
if
a...
or
a
state
party
to
the
lawsuit
actually
responds,
then
do
you
think
that
any
kind
of
a
response
is
subject
to
preclearance?
justice
white
suppose...
any
response
that
purports
to
respond
to
the
request,
or
propose
a
plan?
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
that
the
responding
legislative
body
has
to
purport
to
act
legislatively
in
the
sense
that
it
should
have
a
meeting
and
have
a...
open
to
the
public,
and
go
through
the
procedures
for
the
adopting
of
an
ordinance
or
of
an
order
or
not?
or
can
he
just
sit
down
with
his
lawyer
and
say
well
that's
all
right,
why
don't
you
just
go
ahead
and
write
this
up?
justice
white
--even
if
a
court
has
to
draw
up
its
plan
and
puts
it
in
its
decree,
and
orders
that
the
next
election
be
held
in
accordance
with
this
plan,
it's
the
county
or
the
political
entity
that's
going
to
be
conforming
to
that
plan;
it's
going
to
be
administering
the
plan
but
it's
going
to
be
administering
the
court's
plan.
justice
white
and
that
is
not
subject
to
preclearance,
that
kind
of
administering?
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
it
did
not.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
would
you--
