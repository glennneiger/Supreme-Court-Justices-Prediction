justice
stewart
as
a
party
to
the
lawsuit,
but
not
as
a
legislative
body,
couldn't
that
be?
i
mean,
as
a
legislative
body,
it
is,
i
suppose,
bound
by
texas
law,
but
as
a
party
to
the
lawsuit,
it
is
bound
by
the
orders
of
the
district
court.
justice
stewart
though
it's
not
the
word
he
used.
justice
stewart
and
that...
if
the
defendants
didn't
comply
with
the
direction
they
might
be
in
contempt
of
court.
but
you
just
suggested
that
probably
the
court
didn't
have
power
to
order
anybody
to
submit
a
plan,
a
legislative
body
to
submit
a
plan.
justice
stewart
and
here
it
seems
to
have
done
so,
by
use
of
the
word
directed.
it
didn't
say
requested.
mr.
parmley,
could
it
be--
--or
given
an
opportunity
to.
could
it
be
that
whether
he
used
requested,
directed
or
suggested,
what
it
means
is
if
you
won't
prepare
one
i
will?
justice
stewart
here
did
the
plaintiffs
submit
a
plan?
justice
stewart
of
course,
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case
was
the
dilution
of
the
votes
of
the
mexican-american
voters,
a
claim
that
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
justice
stewart
correct?
and
did
the
plaintiff's
plan
meet
the
plaintiff's
theory
in
that
regard,
that
it
diluted
the
votes
of
mexican-american
voters?
justice
stewart
yes,
well
that...
and
that
claim
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
justice
stewart
right.
but
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
one-person-one-vote
principle.
justice
stewart
that
is,
order
them
at
the
pain
of
contempt,
or
order
them
and
if
they
don't
do
so
then
the
court
does
its
own?
justice
stewart
well,
the
substantive
standards
are
a
little
different
when
you
come
to
multi-member
districts,
and
so
on.
