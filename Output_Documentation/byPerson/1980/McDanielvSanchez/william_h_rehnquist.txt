justice
rehnquist
well
then,
is
what
you're
saying
that
had
these
original
plaintiffs
simply
come
to
the
commissioners'
court
and
said
we
don't
think
the
present
voting
lines
conform
to
one-man-one-vote
rule,
we
want
you
to
change
them,
that
they
would
not
have
had
the
authority
under
texas
law
to
change
them
and
the
plaintiffs
would
have
had
to
go
into
federal
court
to
get
them
changed?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
parmley,
do
you
think
that
wise
contemplated,
when
it
spoke
of
the
unwelcome
responsibility
of
federal
courts
and
the
legislative
responsibility
to
comply
with
the
one-man-one-vote
rule,
that
it
contemplated
an
action
by
a
commissioners'
court
such
as
this
that
was
forbidden
by
state
law,
if
in
fact
it
was
forbidden?
justice
rehnquist
well,
suppose
that
state
statute
forbade
the
county
court
from
doing
what
the
district
court
asked
it
to
do.
do
you
think
that
the
district
court,
nonetheless,
should
have
required
it
to
do
it,
or
should
it
simply
have
devised
a
plan
of
its
own,
realizing
that
the
county
court
was
prohibited
by
a
state
statute
from
itself
acting
at
that
particular
time?
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
pretty
important
question
in
view
of
the
dicennial
census,
isn't
it?
because
presumably
a
lot
of
state
and
municipal
subdivisions
are
going
to
be
subject
to
suit
if
they
don't
redistrict
themselves
on
the
basis
of
new
population
figures
and
yet
if
the
district
court
in
which
the
suit
is
brought
finds
that
they
are
mal-apportioned
and
directs
them
to
submit
a
plan,
they
may
be
under
some
state
law
restraint
as
to
whether
or
not
they
can
do
the
particular
thing
that
the
district
court
wants.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
census
shows,
the
1980
census
figures
show
that
this
kleberg
county
commissioners'
court
is
mal-apportioned,
then
the
commissioners'
court
simply
sits
on
its
hands
and
does
nothing
so
that
it
can't
be
accused
of
seeking
to
institute
any
new
thing
that
would
be
required...
preclearance
under
section
5.
nonetheless,
plaintiffs
bring
an
action
in
the
district
court
saying
you're
violating
our
constitutional
rights
because
it's
not
one-man-one-vote.
they're
kind
of
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place,
aren't
they?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
what
if
you
run
into
the
situation
where
the
commissioners'
court,
after
the
census
information
is
distributed
simply
sits
on
its
hands
and
decides
it
is
clear
we
are
malapportioned...
but
we
like
it
this
way,
and
let
them,
someone
come
after
us.
then
the
plaintiffs
come
and
file
a
malapportionment
suit
in
the
district
court.
what
are
the
mechanics
of
your
plan
that
would
proceed?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
would
require
no
preclearance?
