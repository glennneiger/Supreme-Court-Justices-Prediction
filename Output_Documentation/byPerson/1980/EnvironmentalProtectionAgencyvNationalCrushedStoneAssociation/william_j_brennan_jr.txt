justice
jr.
what
was
that
second--
justice
jr.
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion,
what
was
the
concept
of
total
cost?
justice
jr.
it
would
include
economic
dislocation
of
unemployment?
justice
jr.
did
it?
justice
jr.
well,
but
did
they
do
all
this
before
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
there
were
only
28,
if
that's
the
number--
justice
jr.
--and
now,
is
there
any
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
'77
limitations
and
the
'87?
justice
jr.
well,
the
'87
said
something
about,
there
must
be
the
maximum
technology,
not
the
best
practical
technology--
justice
jr.
--which
is
the
'77
test,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
and
the
'87
is
maximum.
now,
is
there
a
difference
between
those
two
tests?
justice
jr.
--well,
doesn't
this
mean
that
under
the
'87
test
the
burden
is
going
to
be
much
greater
on
a
member
of
the
industry?
justice
jr.
what
did
you
say
was
the
difference?
under
the
'77,
how
many
would
be
driven
out
of
business?
justice
jr.
thirty-five
under
the
'87
and
26
under--
justice
jr.
--now,
how
about
as
a
result
of
the
'87?
justice
jr.
suppose
a
given
member
of
the
industry
is
determined
by
epa
to
be
unable
to
meet
the
prevailing
1977
standards,
must
epa
then
grant
a
variance?
justice
jr.
well,
suppose
they
determine
they
can't,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
is
it
your
position
that
they
need
not,
even
in
that
situation,
grant
a
variance
but
merely
to
consider
that
as
one
of
other
factors?
justice
jr.
suppose
in
that
very
instance
epa
had
refused
to
grant
the
variance?
justice
jr.
tell
me
something.
how
long
does
a
variance
last
when
it's
granted?
justice
jr.
five?
