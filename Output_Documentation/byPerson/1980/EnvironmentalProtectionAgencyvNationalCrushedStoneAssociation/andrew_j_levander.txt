mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
two
decisions
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
scope
of
the
variance
clause
promulgated
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
with
regard
to
the
so-called
1977
effluent
limitations
required
by
the
clean
water
act.
at
the
outset
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
about
the
reasonableness
or
practicability
or
validity
of
any
technical
or
substantive
regulation
promulgated
by
epa.
the
only
question
concerns
this
variance
clause.
the
court
below
concluded
in
both
cases
that
the
variance
clause
promulgated
by
epa
is
invalid
because
epa
refuses
to
consider
the
inability
of
an
individual
discharger
to
afford
compliance
with
the
'77
limitations
as
a
basis
for
granting
a
variance.
those
decisions
are
in
square
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case.
this
court
has
considered
on
several
occasions
the
complicated
provisions
of
the
clean
water
act,
recognizing
that
it
represents
a
bold
attempt
by
congress
to
clean
up
this
nation's
waters.
as
i
said,
it
is
a
complicated
act.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
outlining
the
statutory
framework
which
informs
this
case.
there
are
three
critical
provisions
to
keep
in
mind.
section
301(b),
section
304(b),
and
301(c).
section
301(b)--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--304(b).
section
301(b)
directs
the
administrator
to
promulgate
two
sets
of
increasingly
stringent
effluent
limitations.
those
are
the
so-called
1977
and
1987
effluent
limitations.
the
court
recognized
in
dupont,
or
held
in
dupont,
that
the
regulations
are
to
be
promulgated
on
an
industry-by-industry
basis
or
category-by-category
basis,
and
not
on
a
plant-by-plant
basis.
and
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
the
difference
in
the
stringency
between
the
regulations
is
approximated
by
that
the
'77
limitations
are
to
approximate
if
appropriate
the
average
of
the
best
performers
in
the
various
subcategories
of
an
industry;
whereas
the
1987
regulations
are
to
be
based
on
the
best
performer
in
an
industry
with
an
eye,
if
possible,
to
eliminating
discharges
altogether.
so,
as
i
said,
section
301
requires
the
promulgation
of
these
two
sets
of
industry-wide
effluent
limitations.
section
304(b)
in
turn
sets
forth
factors
that
epa
must
consider
in
promulgating
the
industry-wide
effluent
limitations.
as
to
both
the
'77
and
'87
limitations,
section
304(b)
requires
that
epa
consider
such
factors
as
the
differences
between
plants,
the
ages
of
plants,
the
technologies
used
in
those
plants,
processes,
and
other
similar
factors.
and
in
both
cases
and
most
pertinent
to
this
case,
epa
must
take
into
account
the
cost
of
application.
and
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
in
setting
the
industry-wide
regulations
in
the
crushed
stone,
sand
and
gravel,
and
coal
industries,
which
are
before
this
court,
that
epa
did
take
into
account
quite
extensively
the
costs,
total
costs,
of
application.
the
extensive
administrative
proceedings
leading
up
to
the
promulgation
of
the
regulations
contain
several
reports
by
independent
analysts
regarding
the
various
industries,
and
this
is
the
procedure
that
epa
follows
in
every
case.
these
ensure
that
no
effluent
limitations
promulgated
by
epa
will
substantially
undermine
an
industry
or
in
any
way
shut
down
an
industry
in
toto
or
any
substantial
part.
for
example,
in
the
crushed
stone
industry
and
sand
and
gravel
industry
combined,
epa
considered
that
the
total
cost
of
the
1977
limitations
would
be
approximately
$21
million,
and
there
are
10,000
dischargers
in
these
combined
industries.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
all
of
the
industry.
that's
right.
and
there
are
10,000
of
those
in
the
two
combined,
crushed
stone
and
sand
and
gravel,
approximately,
and
the
estimate
was
that
the
total
cost
to
those
10,000
different
firms
would
be
about
$20
million,
and
that
this
would
have
an
effect
on
the
price
of
the
product
that
they
sell
somewhere
between
2
and
8
percent,
at
most.
and
further,
epa
goes
even
further
than
just
estimating
the
total
impact
and
total
cost
to
the
industry.
it
also
estimates
how
many
marginal
firms
may
be
forced
to
close
because
they
cannot
afford
compliance.
as
i
indicated
before,
there
are
about
4,800
crushed
stone
facilities
and
epa
estimated
that
at
most
35
marginal
firms
would
be
forced
to
close
because
they
could
not
afford
to
comply
or
otherwise
would
not
want
to
comply.
and
these
are
all
very
small
firms.
the
epa
also
estimated,
with
regard
to
the
sand
and
gravel
industry,
for
example,
that
only
26
out
of
the
more
than
5,000
dischargers
might
be
forced
to
close
as
a
result
of
the
effluent
limitation.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
the
'77;
that's
right.
now,
that
indicates
that
epa
takes
very
seriously
the
requirement
that
it
take
into
account
total
cost
when
it
sets
the
initial
industry-wide
regulation.
in
fact,
the
proceedings
in
these
cases
show
that
epa
rejected
various
requests
by
environmental
groups
and
others
to
regulate
other
kinds
of
pollutants
than
those
it
chose
eventually
to
regulate
because
they
were
prohibitively
expensive.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
i
mean,
epa
would
not
promulgate
a
regulation
which
would
close
down
the
industry
entirely,
that
no
one
in
the
industry
could
afford.
and
that's
not
a
very
realistic
possibility
because,
in
the
first
instance,
the
guideline
for
the
'77
limitations
are
existing
firms
which
have
technology
and
the
limitations
based
on
existing
use
of
technology.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
concept
of
total
cost
as
evidenced
in
the
legislative
history
primarily
is
a
kind
of
economic
total
cost,
the
outlay
of
firms,
capital
costs,
operating
costs,
and
also--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--yes.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
did
in
these
cases.
representative
jones
indicated
that
total
cost
also
means
total
impact
on
the
economy
as
a
whole
in
the
regional
economics.
nothing
in
the
word
"total
cost",
however,
or
in
the
legislative
history
suggests--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--that's
right.
there
are
very
thick,
huge
reports
that
they
put
out
which
analyze
in
detail
the
economics
of
a
particular
industry.
and
only
having
judged
that,
they
will
not
dislocate
industry
in
toto
and
there
will
not
be
massive
dislocation,
do
they
promulgate
a
reasonable
and
practicable
regulation.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
to
some
extent.
again,
epa
takes
into
account
on
the
'87,
the
cost
of
application.
it's
required
to
do
so
by
statute
and
it
does
so.
but
the
emphasis,
there's
a
slightly
greater
emphasis
on
costs
with
regard
to
the
'77
limitations.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
it
says--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--that's
right,
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--yes.
as
a
practical
matter,
as
i
indicated,
the
starting
point
is
a
different
one.
one
is
the
average
of
the
best
performers,
the
other
one
is
the
best
performer.
and
as
a
statutory
matter,
you--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--the
average
of
the
best
performers
in
the
various
subcategories
of
a
particular
industry.
and
you
kind
of
analyze
the
industry
as
a
whole
to
see
in
various-aged
plants
who's
the
best
of
the
old
plants,
the
new
plants,
or
other--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--it
can
be
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
and
in
fact--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--twenty-six
and
35,
respectively,
in
the
two--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--no,
excuse
me;
i'm
sorry.
thirty-five
out
of
the
4,800
crushed
stone
facilities
and
26
out
of
the
more
than
5,000
in
the
sand
and
gravel
industry
will
be
or
could
be
forced
out
of
business
as
a
result
of
the
'77
limitations.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
there
has...
since
in
these
industries
up
till
now
the
'87
limitations
are
approximating
the
'77
limitations,
since
the
best
performers
happen
also
to
be
the
best
performer,
and
since
there's
not
a
great
need
for
further
improvement
at
this
time,
they
don't
expect
anybody
to
be
put
out
of
business,
as
i
understand
it,
as
a
result
of
the
'87
limitations.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
exactly
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
they
could
be.
that's
right.
on
the
other
hand,
then,
in
other
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
could
be
large
differences
between
the
two,
although
that
has
not
happened
to
date.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
and
also
it's
a
technology-forcing
statute,
and
so
in
the
course
of
the
ten
years
there
may
be
new
inventions
and
new
devices
which
will--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
at
some
point,
if
epa
initially
promulgated
on
the
interim
basis,
not
a
final
regulation,
and
then
they
went
out
and
they
did
an
economic
survey
and
they
saw
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
industry
was
going
to
be
closed
down
as
a
result
of
that,
they
would
have
to
rethink
the
level
of
technology
and
make
it
more
affordable
and
reasonable
for
the
industry
as
a
whole.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct,
and
that
was
done
here,
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
am
informed
by
the
administration
that
in
no
case
under
the
1977
limitations
did
the
economic
forecast
show
that
anything
more
than
1
percent
of
an
industry
would
be
closed
as
a
result
of
the
industry-wide
level.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
or
it
could
turn
out
that
upon
promulgation
they'll
find
out
that
they
didn't
know
enough
about
the
industry
as
a
whole,
and
so
they
have
to
go
back
and
get
some
more
information,
because
when
you
have
an
industry
of
more
than
5,000
or
6,000
dischargers,
as
you
have
in
these
cases,
you
can't...
they
don't
take
into
account
every
single
discharger.
and
so
they
mighty
have
to
go
back
and
get
some
more
data
or
whatever,
or
they'd
have
to
rethink
the
process.
but
today,
as
i
said,
in
this
case
there's
no
question
that
the
effluent
limitations
which
are
not
at
issue
here
were
reasonable
and
did
take
into
account
total
cost
of
application.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
that's
the...
well,
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
but
the
reason
is,
the
question
is,
why
can't
he
meet
the
limitations?
if
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--no.
it
depends,
mr.
justice
brennan--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--that's
right.
and
they
cannot
consider--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--yes.
and
their
basis
is...
i
want
to
make
one
point
very
clear.
we
do
take
into
account
the
cost
of
compliance
for
an
individual
discharger
in
the
sense
that
we
analyze
their
plant.
if
they
come
in
and
they
say,
we
need
a
variance,
and
this
is
a
real
case
i'll
have
to
give
you
as
a
hypothetical,
one
of
the
requirements,
say
in
the
gravel
industry
was
the
recycling
of
water.
and
this
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
are
large
pits
that
are
easily
available
to
most
dischargers
in
the
industry
to
allow
a
settling
pit
to
allow
the
recycling
of
the
water.
and
this
discharger
came
in
and
said,
well,
that
may
be
true
for
the
rest
of
my
competitors
but
i'm
located
on
a
100-foot
cliff
and
the
place
that
i
have,
the
only
place
that
i
have
for
a
settling
pond
is
100
feet
below.
in
order
for
him
to
recycle,
of
course,
he
would
have
to
have
tremendously
expensive
pumping
equipment
to
get
the
water
back
up
to
the
top
and
in
that
case
epa
says,
we'll
grant
a
variance,
because
you
are
fundamentally
different
from
the
other
members
of
the
industry
whom
we
considered
in
setting
this
regulation.
and
so,
to
that
extent,
cost
does
come
in
in
the
sense
that
his
costs
of
compliance
would
be
exceedingly
greater,
maybe
sixty
times
greater,
than
the
average.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
then
there
might
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
that's
reviewable
in
the--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--no.
under
the
variance
provision,
with
regard
to
the
'77
effluent
limitations--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
i
will
get
to
that
in
one
moment
if
i
could,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
follow
the
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
insofar
as
he
came
in
and
said--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--and
the
question
then
becomes,
why
his
expenses
would--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
if
your
plant
for
all
purposes
directly
relevant
to
compliance
is
exactly
the
same
as
your
three
competitors
and
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
your
having
been
economically
inefficient,
or
incompetent,
and
you
just
cannot
afford,
because
you
don't
have
the
money
that
your
more
efficient
competitors
have
to
comply,
and
you
are
no
different
in
any
other
respect,
that
is
not
a
basis
for
a
variance
and
you'll
be
forced
to
close.
except--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--or
comply;
right.
and,
i
want
to
point
out
that
section
8
of
the
act
creates
a
$800
million
revolving
loan
fund
which
is
administered
by
the
small
business
administration.
any
firm
under
250
employees
who
would
otherwise
have
to
shut
his
plant
or
close
his
operations
because
he
could
not
afford
to
comply
can
go
and
get
an
sba
loan.
and
that
is
a
very
active
program.
up
to
june
30
of
this
year
i
understand
there
were
$28
million
in
sba
loans
under
section
8.
going
back
to
the
statutory
framework
for
a
moment,
as
i
said
before,
301
requires
the
industry-wide
effluent
limitations,
'77
and
'87.
304(b)
sets
forth
the
factors
that
must
be
taken
into
account
as
to
both
'77
and
'87
costs
of
application
as
relevant.
and
section
301(c),
which
is
quite
critical
to
this
case,
provides
the
kind
of
affordability
variance
that
respondents
seek
here,
but
it
only
provides
it
with
regard
to
the
'87
limitations.
under
the
1987
limitations
a
discharger
can
get
a
variance
by
going
in
and
saying,
i
cannot
afford
to
comply.
the
variance--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--but
then
presumably
he's
been
complying
with
the
'77
all
along;
there's
no
reason
he
needs
a
variance.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
insofar
as
the
coal
regulations
may
be
more
stringent
in
'87.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that
was
a...
that
was
underlying
the
problem
in
dupont,
i
think.
in
dupont
we
suggested
that
the
statute
and
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
clearly
required
industry-wide
regulations.
but
because
we
cannot
take
into
account
every
single
discharger
in
the
industry,
we
would
grant
variances
based
on
fundamentally
different
factors
between
one
discharger
and
another
that
we
hadn't
taken
into
account
in
setting
the
regulation.
and
in
a
sense,
for
that
particular
discharger,
that
is
simply
creating
a
category
of
one
or
more,
depending
on
how
many
fit
into
his
kind
of
situation
as
opposed
to
the
industry
as
a
whole,
and
we're
allowed
under
the
act,
under
301
and
304,
to
create
subcategories.
there
is
no
specific
variance
provision,
and
the
10th
circuit
in
the
petroleum
institute
case
and
some
commentators
have
suggested
that
no
variances
need
be
granted
at
all,
and
there
is
some
strength
to
that.
first
of
all,
dupont's
discussion
of
the
new
sources
under
306
indicated
that
the
absence
of
variance
meant
that
no
variances
should
be
granted.
we
still
believe,
however,
that
some
variances
should
and
will
be
granted
based
on
this
fundamental
difference
factor.
but
the
express
language
of
301(c),
which
is
the
critical
provision
here,
which
allows
an
affordability
variance
with
regard
to
the
'87
limitations,
does
not
apply
to
'77
limitations
and
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
inability
of
a
discharger
to
afford
compliance
was
not
to
be
a
factor
with
regard
to
the
'77
limitations.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
conceivable
although
i'd
like
to
point
out
two
things,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first,
congress
anticipated
at
a
minimum
that
the
imposition
of
the
1977
effluent
limitations
will
require
as
many
as
300
major
firms
employing
up
to
125,000
people
to
be
put
out
of
business
because
they
couldn't
afford
or
did
not
wish
to
afford
compliance
with
the
regulations.
so
that's
congress's
judgment
that
the
clean
waters
of
this
nation
are
more
important
than
some
of
those
marginal
firms.
and
the
second
point
is
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case
i
believe
that
all
the
firms
that
epa
anticipated
would
be
forced
out
of
business
were
in
fact
smaller
firms
and
i
take
it
that
they
were
in
such
positions
and
so
penurious
that
they
could
afford
even
with
a
section
8
loan
or
didn't
wish
to
try
under
a
section
8
loan
to
afford
to
comply.
the
respondents
rely
on
section
304(b)(1)(b)
as
the
basis
for
their
argument.
they
say,
the
statute
requires
epa
to
take
into
account
total
cost;
we
agree,
on
the
industry-wide
level.
and
that
under
our
own
version
of
the
variance,
we
have
to
retake
into
account
and
reconsider
every
single
factor
on
the
variance
level.
and
therefore
we
are
trapped
in
our
own
language
and
we
must
therefore
grant
these
economic
variances.
well,
there
are
several
problems
with
that
argument.
first,
both
the
'77
and
'87
limitations,
actually
section
304(b)(1)(b)
and
(b)(2)(b)
require
epa
to
take
into
account
"cost
of
application".
if
the
words
"cost
of
application"
meant,
"and
you
must
reconsider
on
the
variance
level.
"
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
expressly
create
this
section
301(c)
variance,
which
it
did
create
and
which
it
created
only
with
regard
to
the
'87
limitations.
the
second
problem
is
that
respondents
have
misconstrued
epa's
variance
clause
and
a
well-stated
and
firm
position
all
along.
since
1974
when
the
first
regulation
came
out--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--that's
right.
it
must
be
above
'77
level.
but
that
makes
a
very--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
except
that
you
wouldn't
have
needed
to
say,
301.
you
wouldn't
have
needed
to
create
the
variance
on
economic
grounds.
you
would
have
just
said,
variances
which
are
permissible
under
the
'87
have
to
at
least
meet
the
'77
level.
but
they
went
ahead
and
created
a
specific
variance
based
on
the
affordability
factor
and
put
a
limitation
on
it.
but
that
limitation
further
emphasizes
the
correctness
of
epa's
position.
congress
obviously
intended
the
'77
effluent
limitations
to
be
a
uniform
floor
and
'87
was
a
hope
to
clean
up
the
waters
even
further,
but
there
was
a
realization
that
those
were
more
stringent
regulations
and
that
some
businesses
who
were
doing
a
good
job
insofar
as
they
had
already
complied
with
the
'77
limitations
might
not
be
able
to
take
the
next
step
further,
only
part
of
that
step.
and
so,
under
those
circumstances,
a
variance
may
be
available.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
the
record
does
not
break
it
down
but
it
does
indicate
that
the
majority
of
firms
are
quite
small
in
terms
of
the
percentage--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--i
would
guess
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
although
in
terms
of
production
there
are
few
firms,
like
1
percent
or
10
percent
of
one
industry
produces
40
percent
of
the
production.
so
there
are
a
few
large
firms
out
there
producing
over
a
million
tons
a
year.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
think
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
but
the
regulation
was
set
by
taking
into
account
these
variances.
if
an
industry
comes
in,
as
i
said,
this
birdsall
company
in
south
dakota
and
says,
well,
we're
not
just
slightly
different
than
our
fellow
next
door,
we're
a
hundred
feet
different,
and
that's
a
fundamental
difference,
then
he's
entitled
to
a
variance.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
the
permits
last
for
five
years.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
right.
and
so
the
variance
is
applied
for
and
received
at
the
beginning
of
the
permit.
then
it's
good
for
the
five
years.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
correct.
and
for
'87,
actually.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
the
'77
limitations...
when
a
permit
expires,
then
you
would
have
to
reapply
for
the
variance.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
not
altogether
clear.
there,
the
language
of
the
opinion--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--yes.
well,
that
at
a
minimum.
respondents
seem
to
back
off
the
borderline
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
say
that
all
we
need
to
consider,
you
don't...
it's
not
dispositive.
the
court
of
appeals
language
seems
to
indicate
that
it's
just
like
301(c),
which
is
dispositive,
provided
that
you
are
at
least
complying
with
the
'77
limitations.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes.
before
i
do
that
i'd
like
to
make
one
point,
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
or
two
points.
the
first
point
is
that
nothing
in
their
brief...
at
least
i
read
it
several
times,
and
i
could
find
nothing
about
any
constitutional
question,
any
delegation
question;
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
the
second
point
is,
as
this
court
made
very
clear
in
the
dupont
opinion,
under
the
clean
water
act
the
question
is
not
what
we
think
is
an
appropriate
way
to
regulate;
it
is
what
congress
said
and
what
congress
did.
and
here
the
language
of
the
act,
although
somewhat
complicated,
strongly
supports
epa's
position
and
the
legislative
history,
which
has
not
been
discussed
here
at
all,
is
simply
overwhelming.
the
report,
the
conference
report...
senator
muskie,
who
was
quoted
with
approval
in
this
court's
dupont
opinion
at
page
130
and
page
129,
and
other
consistent
statements
by
congressmen
over
and
over
and
over
again
reflect
three
things,
one,
that
these
regulations
would
force
certain
marginal
economically
inefficient
companies
out
of
business;
two,
that
in
order
to
sort
of
appease
that
problem
to
some
extent,
congress
created
section
8
financing.
senator
nelson
introduced
that
bill
saying
variances
are
a
problem
because...
and
it's
exactly
the
situation
where
you
have
a
little
fellow
who's
going
to
go
out
of
work
and
it's
very
sympathetic,
that
it's
hard
to
deny
him
a
variance.
nonetheless,
congress
made
a
determination
that
he
would
be
denied
a
variance
unless
he
could
get
the
section
8
funding.
and
three,
over
and
over
and
over
again...
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
7
and
8
of
the
reply
brief
in
particular.
there's
just
statement
after
statement
that
the
economic
affordability
will
not
be
reconsidered
on
a
plant-by-plant
basis.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no.
the
only
contrary
indications
that
are
put
out
by
respondent
are
post-adoptive
legislative
history.
and
even
as
to
that,
i
think
it
is
indicative
of
the
weakness
of
their
position.
they
claim
that
in
1977
when
congress
amended
the
act
that
it
thoroughly
considered
and
approved
and
acquiesced
in
the
4th
circuit
appalachian
power
decision.
now,
the
basis
of
that
claim
is
three
things.
first,
the
congress
didn't
expressly
disapprove
it
in
1977,
so
we
have
this
legislative
silence
which
is
supposed
to
be
dispositive.
second,
that
a
congressman
got
up
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
waved
a
126-page
library
of
congress
report
which
indexes
144
reported
decisions,
including
the
appalachian
power
decision
and
including
decisions
that
suggested
that
the
variance
clause
was
valid
on
the
same
page,
and
said
that
this
report
he
found
it
very
useful
to
understand
the
act,
saying
nothing
about
the
appalachian
power
decision.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
we
are
supposed
to
assume
that
congress
was
aware
of
and
acquiesced
in
this
decision.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes.
i
think
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
is
correct
that...
and
this
is
the
part
i
explain
what
the
difference
is...
epa
will
take
into
account
all
kinds
of
fundamental
differences
directly
related
to
compliance
which
affect
the
cost,
that
is,
the
financial
outlay
that
a
discharger
would
have
to
spend
in
order
to
comply.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
the
man
on
the
cliff
problem
and
all
kinds
of
other
problems.
another
example--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--cost
of
compliance.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
correct.
what
we
will
not
take
into
account,
the
discharger's
bankbook,
which
is
to
say
we
will
not
take
into
account
affordability,
his
ability
to
afford,
so
that
if
you
had
four
dischargers
in
an
industry,
all
of
them
identical,
and
one
of
them
was
simply
economically
inefficient
and
had
wasted
money
or
didn't
have
money
or
was
incompetent
or
whatever
his
problem
is--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
that,
of
course,
i
answer
by
section
8
financing
which
is
available,
so
that
the
person
who
couldn't
get
monies
for--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
that's
a
closer
question
as
to
whether
his
lack
of
money,
we
don't
take
into
account.
now,
if
he
were
to
show
that
for
some
reason
he
was
different
from
the
rest
of
the
industry
in
his
ability
to
get
financing
and
that
was
not
satisfied
by
section
8,
that's
a
question
i
don't
think
epa's
passed
upon,
but
my
answer
would
be
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
variance
simply
because
his
cost
of
money
was
11
percent
versus
12
percent
or
10
percent.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
we
don't
want
to
see
it.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right.
what
we
want
to
know--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--that
we
want
to
know,
and
that's
the
basis
for
variances
and
that's
what
will
keep
these
claims
of
all
these
industries--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--in
taking
into
account
we
analyze
the
total
cost
of
application,
which
includes
the
industry-wide
outlay
to
afford
compliance.
and
we
also,
in
addition,
we
have
discretion
under
304(b)
to
take
into
account
any
other
relevant
factor
and
we
have
consistently--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--well,
i
think
it
heightens
the
analysis
on
the
variance
proceeding,
but
it's
simply
irrelevant--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--we
don't.
it's
not
affordability.
congress
made
the
determination
that
affordability
is
only
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
'87
limitations
and
not
as
to
the
'77
limitations.
and
one
last
point,
if
i
might.
there's
been
a
lot
of
criticism
here
of
epa
vacillating.
if
you'll
read
the
progression
of
epa
statements,
starting
with
39
fed.
reg.
in
1974
and
up
to
this
very
date,
one
thing
that
has
never
been
vacillated
on
is
this
question
of
affordability.
epa
has
never
suggested
and
has
never
taken
into
account
affordability
as
a
basis,
based
on
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
thank
you
very
much.
