justice
white
the
'77?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose,
then,
the
epa
does
think
it's
relevant
and
significant
how
many
marginal
firms
will
be
put
out
of
existence?
justice
white
wouldn't
he
have
to
show
that
he
had
some
other
proposal
that
would
improve?
justice
white
oh,
you're
talking
about
'77
now?
justice
white
if
it
were
'87--
justice
white
i'll
argue
with
you
on
that.
that
'87
variance
clause
puts
another
condition
on
them.
justice
white
that's
an
independent
reason
for
having
it,
for
having
that
variance
expressly
stated.
justice
white
this
is
for
the
'77?
justice
white
but
at
least
a
variance
under
'77
couldn't
last
any
longer
than...
a
variance
would
be
required
for
the
'87s?
justice
white
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
you
had
to
take
in
affordability
in
a
sense
that
if
he
couldn't
afford
it,
you
had
to
give
the
variance.
is
that
it?
justice
white
on
the
other
hand,
it
isn't
altogether
clear
that
the
question
that
you
present
in
your
brief
is
really
the
question.
you
say,
does
it
require
a
consideration
of
the
economic?
justice
white
you
mean
you've
never
claimed
that
just
because
you
couldn't
afford
it,
you
were
entitled
to
a
variance?
justice
white
or
even...
or
for
the
variance.
justice
white
well,
he...
i
thought
he
also
said
that
in
making
the
'77
regulations,
might
not
that...
that
they
considered
affordability
in
the
sense
that,
how
many
firms
would
be
put
out
of
existence?
justice
white
well,
when
does
he
get
a
variance?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
when
does
he
win?
i'll
put
it
that
way.
justice
white
what
does
he
have
to
show
to
win
so
that
he
gets
his
permit?
that's
what
i--
justice
white
--you
know,
well,
you've
already
conceded
as
far
as
i
can
tell
that
just
because
he--
justice
white
--can't
afford
it
doesn't
get
him
very
far.
justice
white
under
'77,
for
'77?
justice
white
what
do
you
make
out
of
the
example
that
your
colleague
gave
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
man
who
is
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff,
and
if
you
really
enforce
the
regulations
against
him,
he
wouldn't
get
a
permit
and
if
he
had
to
live
up
to
it
he
couldn't
afford
it?
didn't
he
indicate
that
under
the
'77
variance
procedures
that
they
might
give
him
a
special
treatment?
justice
white
oh,
you
didn't.
justice
white
well,
i
asked
him
if
he
weren't
talking
about
the
'87
variance
and
he
said,
no,
he
was
talking
about
the
'77.
justice
white
because
let's
assume
that
i
understood
him
correctly.
then
i
assume
that
he's,
what
he
said
is
that
he
would
have
to
undertake
a
very
expensive
pumping
operation.
and
if
that
isn't
taking
into
consideration
evidence
of
cost
and
affordability,
what
is
it?
justice
white
then
he's
even
changed
his
position
more
than
you
thought,
then.
justice
white
i
perhaps
misunderstood
him.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
he
meant
by
it?
what
was
his
cliff
example
all
about?
justice
white
this
is
for
the
'77
variance?
justice
white
different
from
the
'87?
is
that
right?
justice
white
--but
at
least
we'd
have
a
record
about
what
kind
of
evidence
they
really
will
permit
and
what
they
won't.
how
did
you
understand
the
example
that
the
solicitor
general
presented,
the
100-foot
cliff
example?
justice
white
technological?
it's
just
he's
on
a
cliff
and
it'd
cost
him
money
to
pump
water.
justice
white
i
thought
that
the
implication
was
that,
sure,
we'll
receive
evidence
of
that.
justice
white
well,
it's
evidence
of
affordability
anyway,
the
cost
is.
justice
white
and
so
you're
suggesting
the
solicitor
general
isn't
following
his
own
regulations,
in
this
example?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
it
was
fair,
i
thought
it
was
fair
to
ask
you.
justice
white
you
mean,
if
the
fellow
who
is
putting
in
the
evidence
couldn't
go
on
and
say,
furthermore,
i
can't
afford
this?
justice
white
but
that
they
might
give
him
a
variance
because
it
was
more
expensive
for
him?
justice
white
what
are
we
arguing
about?
justice
white
the
government's
position
was
that
that
was
wholly
irrelevant.
justice
white
but
now
you
just
said
it
might
or
might
not
be
relevant.
justice
white
are
there
some
contrary
indications
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
white
so
you
take
evidence
of
cost
as
relevant?
justice
white
and
you
do...
would
you
agree
with
brother
stevens
that
it
will
be
determinative
sometimes?
justice
white
so
if
he
offers
his
operating
statement
for
the
past
five
years,
you
reject
it?
justice
white
you
reject
it.
justice
white
but
if
he
wants
to
tell
you
how
much
it's
going
to
cost
him?
justice
white
even
though
in
making
up
the
regulation
you
wanted
all
those
operating
statements?
justice
white
you
don't
think
the
fact
that
he'll
go
out
of
business
triggers
the
necessity
to
consider
some
of
the
other
factors?
justice
white
well,
then,
how
can
you
say
you
don't
want
to
see
his
operating
statements?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
--
were
brought
here
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
had
misconstrued
its
powers
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
that
act
authorizes
the
agency
to
issue
a
--
and
pollution
discharge
limitations
country
wide,
and
in
1977
pursuant
to
that
authority,
the
agency
issued
discharge
limitations
for
the
coal
mining
industry
and
for
various
categories
of
the
--
of
the
mining
and
processing
industries.
each
set
of
regulations
contained
a
variance
provisions
and
it
was
these
provisions
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
it
to
be
too
narrowly
drawn
and
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbian
circuit
had
held
precisely
to
the
contrary.
we
issued
certiorari
to
settle
the
dispute.
we
think
the
environmental
protection
agency
properly
exercised
its
power
and
that
the
variance
provisions
were
not
too
narrowly
drawn.
our
reasons
for
thinking
so
are
stated
in
an
opinion
on
the
file
with
the
clerk
and
were
not
very
instructive
or
useful
to
repeat
them
in
this
oral
announcement.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
accordingly
reversed.
the
court
is
unanimous
except
that
mr.
justice
powel
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
