we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
79-770,
the
environmental
protection
agency
vs.
national
crushed
stone,
et
al.--
mr.
levander,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
i
missed
the
first...
the
average
of
the
best,
or--
chief
justice
burger
realistically,
the
two
standards
might
not
be
very
far
apart.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
burger
the
average
of
the
best,
or
the
highest,
might
be
quite
close
together.
chief
justice
burger
and
that's
why
the
10-year
span--
chief
justice
burger
--to
allow
time
for
economic
and
other
and
technological
adjustments?
chief
justice
burger
suppose,
instead
of
27
and
35
it
was
270
and
350?
how
would
that
alter
this
case?
chief
justice
burger
if
you
had
those
larger
figures,
there
would
be
a
further
subanalysis
to
be
made
to
determine
whether
those
were
the
marginal
operators
or
whether
they
were
average
all
the
way
through
the
industry.
chief
justice
burger
--before
you
leave
'77,
let
me
put
this
hypothetical.
suppose
an
applicant
comes
in
and
shows
that
if
he
is
required
to
comply
with
the
contemporary
standards,
he
will
not
be
competitive
with
the
other
two
or
three
existing
competitors
in
his
area.
is
that
a
factor
that
would
be
weighed?
i'm
not
saying
that
it
would
be
dispositive,
but
would
it
be
considered
by
epa?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i'd
come
in
to
epa
and
say,
i've
got
three
competitors
here.
if
i
do
all
the
things
that
you're
telling
me
to
do,
and
which
they
are
now
doing,
i
won't
be
able
to
compete
with
them.
chief
justice
burger
is
epa
going
to
say
to
me,
well,
you're
just
not
very
efficient,
because
if
your
competitors
can
do
it,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
do
it?
chief
justice
burger
forced
to
comply?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit
to
ask
whether
this
record
discloses
how
many
of
the
total
in
each
of
these
industries
would
be
under
250
employees?
chief
justice
burger
i
should
think
that
the
general
observation
would
be,
although
i
would
not
notice
it
judicially,
that
most
of
the
crushed
stone
people,
more
than
half
of
them,
would
be
under
250
now.
chief
justice
burger
they
might
be
large
firms
but
each
unit...
they
might
well
be
scattered;
a
corporation
might
own
ten
of
these
units...
but
each
of
the
units
is
not
likely
to
be
over
250
employees.
chief
justice
burger
and
they'd
each
be
operating
under
different
conditions
with
different
drainage
problems
and
different
supply
problems.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
freeman.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
freeman,
let
me
ask
you
this.
chief
justice
burger
what
inferences,
if
any,
could
reasonably
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
such
a
small
percentage
of
the...
such
a
small
segment
of
the
industry
in
each
case
here
is
adversely
affected?
chief
justice
burger
well,
we
were
given
some
figures.
do
you
challenge
those
figures?
chief
justice
burger
suppose,
for
example,
that
the
record
showed
that
1/10
of
1
percent
of
all
the
employees
in
the
industry,
the
employees,
would
be
unemployed,
out
of
business,
under
the
regulations,
would...
would
that
reasonably
suggest
that
the
regulations
were
not
unduly
stringent?
chief
justice
burger
or
even
too
loose?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
concretely
to
see
if
i
understand
the
point
you
made
about
their
resistance
to
subjective
evidence,
as
distinguished
from
objective,
industry-wide
evidence.
assume
a
town
that
has
500
employable
and
employed
people
and
a
coal
mine,
and
you
offer
to
prove
to
epa
that
if
a
variance
is
not
granted,
350
of
them
will
be
out
of
work.
and
do
you
say
that
they
will
decline
to
consider
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
do
they
in
fact?
chief
justice
burger
do
they
in
fact
and
in
practice
have
they
refused
tenders
of
evidence
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then
the
epa
is
allowing
it
in.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
garrett.
chief
justice
burger
before
you
go
on,
let
me
pursue
the
hypothetical
if
not
real
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
should
the
court
try
to
decide
this
kind
of
issue
on
abstractions
as
distinguished
from
a
case
in
which,
a
specific
case
in
which
evidence
were
tendered
that
350
out
of
500
people
in
a
particular
town
would
be
unemployed
because
of
the
closure
of
a
coal
mine,
rather
than
trying
to
pass
on
the
regulations
in
the
abstract?
if
you'd
care
to
comment
on
that
at
some
point
in
your
presentation?
chief
justice
burger
will
not
be
grounds,
but
will
it
be
received
and
weighed,
along
with
other
factors?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
your
response
to
be
taken
as
saying
that
if
the
epa
declined
to
receive
evidence
of
the
hypothetical
i
suggested,
economic
factors
on
the
town,
that
would
be
error?
or--
chief
justice
burger
i'm
sure
mr.
levander
will
enlighten
us
when
it
comes
to
his
four
minutes.
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
the
cliff
is
only
about
a
third
as
high
as
it's
been
described
but
it's
right
on
the
border
between
justifying
a
fundamental
cost
difference
and
fundamental
not.
you
have
two
companies,
one
owned
by
a
very
large
corporation
with
lots
of
money,
another
owned
by
a
marginal
operator,
that
the
marginal
operator
would
get
a
variance
and
the
other
one
would
not.
chief
justice
burger
yes;
dupont's.
if
dupont
owned
that
coal
mine
or
crushed
rock--
you're
saying
the
regulations
are
okay.
oh
no.
--well,
if
you
say
it
might
or
might
not
be
relevant,
what
are
we
arguing
about?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
sure
mr.
levander
will
clear
it
up
for
us.
chief
justice
burger
how
does
that
translate
into
number
of
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you'll
clarify
this
problem
for
us,
mr.
levander.
chief
justice
burger
is
that
the
man
on
the
cliff
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
environmental
protection
agency
against
national
crushed
stone
association
and
the
consolidated
case
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
