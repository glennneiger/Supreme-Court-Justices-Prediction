--when
you
say
an
industry,
you're
not
talking
about
a
particular
firm,
you're
talking
about
all
of
the
firms
in
the
industry?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
levander,
looking
at
the
government
policy
as
a
whole
here
and
including
the
small
business
administration
loan,
it
isn't
going
to
be
the
kind
of
mom-and-pop
crushed
stone
operators
that
are
hit,
when
you
refer
to
the
marginal
ones,
because
they
can
get
the
loans.
it's
going
to
be
ones
conceivably
who
employ
more
than
250
people.
