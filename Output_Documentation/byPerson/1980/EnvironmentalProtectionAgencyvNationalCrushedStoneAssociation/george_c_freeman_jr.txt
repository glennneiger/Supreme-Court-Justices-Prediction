mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
argued
this
case
against
epa
three
times
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit,
i
have
filed
amicus
briefs
in
the
dupont
case
which
preceded
this
whole
issue
in
many
ways
in
that
circuit
and
in
this
court.
i
have
read
with
great
diligence
the
opinions
and
briefs
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case.
i
am
back
in
the
4th
circuit
in
a
continuation
of
the
appalachian
case
with
epa.
every
time
i
argue
this
case,
epa
has
a
new
theory
for
its
position.
if
you
will
look
at
the
opinions
below,
you
will
see
the
confusion
that
epa
is
continually
shifting
interpretation
of
its
variance
clause
and
the
basis
for
its
right
to
exclude
evidence
of
affordability
in
a
variance
proceeding
in
all
of
the
cases
which
they
have
decided.
justice
white,
to
come
to
the
point
that
you
just
made,
the
issue
here
today
is
not
the
question
of
whether
or
not
evidence
of
affordability
in
a
variance
proceeding,
standing
alone,
justifies
a
variance.
that
has
never
been
an
argument
that
we
have
made,
it
has
never
been
a
holding--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--no,
sir.
and
what
the
heart
of
this
case
is,
is
what
kind
of
evidence,
economic
evidence
is
admissible
in
a
variance
clause
proceeding.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
able
counsel's
concession
that
under
304(b)(1)(b)
that
epa
must
consider
evidence
of
affordability
for
the
industry
as
a
whole
is
completely--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
--is
conclusive
that
they
have
to
consider
it
in
a
variance
proceeding.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
and
that's
the
heart
of
this
case,
sir.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
observed,
there
is
no
express
authority
in
301
for
epa
to
issue
1977
regulations.
that's
what
dupont
was
all
about.
what
dupont
said
was,
you
have
to
look
at
the
structure
of
the
act
as
a
whole
to
derive
implied
authority
for
epa
to
issue
those
'77
regulations
in
the
first
place.
and
what
the
4th
circuit
said
and
what
you
affirmed
in
dupont
was
that
that
implied
authority
was
conditioned.
it
was
conditioned
two
ways.
first,
those
'77
regulations
were
only
presumptively
applicable
at
the
permit-issuing
stage,
and
as
this
court
characterized
it,
saying
the
same
thing,
therefore
you
have
to
have
a
meaningful
variance
clause.
and
the
logic
of
dupont
is,
and
the
logic
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
recent
appalachian
power
case,
which
i
just
argued
against
them,
is
that
a
variance
clause
proceeding
under
1977
regulations
is
not
a
true
variance
at
all.
what
it
does
is
it
shifts
the
burden
and
permits
the
plant
owner
to
come
in
and
produce
evidence
under
all
of
the
statutory
criteria
of
304(b)(1)(b)
that
was
relevant
to
the
setting
of
those
presumptively
applicable
nationwide
effluent
limitations
for
'77,
and
if
he
can
show
by
evidence
under
those
criteria
that
bpt
for
his
own
particular
plant
is
a
different
limitation,
then
he
doesn't
get
a
variance.
this
is
for
case-by-case
adjustment
of
bpt.
that's
in
the
government's
first
brief
in
this
case--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--he
never
gets
a
true
variance,
sir.
he
gets
the
right...
the
purpose
of
the
variance
clause
is
to
shift
the
evidence
to
him
at--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--when
does
he
win?
well,
let's
take
how
you
would
introduce--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--all
right.
what
he
has
to
show
is...
and
let's
assume
this
is
an
owner
that
cannot
afford,
he
cannot
pay
the
price--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--yes,
but
i'm
going
to
tell
you--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
i
would
like
to
say
how
that
evidence
is
relevant.
and
epa's
position
is
that
the
evidence
is
not
relevant
and
it
will
refuse
to
receive
any
evidence
of
individual
plant
affordability
in
a
variance
clause,
and
that's
the
heart
of
this.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
one
of
the
statutory
criteria
under
304(b)(1)(b)
is...
and
i
will
try
to
quote
it
to
be
precise
about
it...
i'm
quoting
from
the
statute,
"total
cost
of
application
of
technology
is
relevant
to
the
effluent
reduction
benefits
to
be
achieved
from
such
application.
"
now
that
is
a
statutory
cost
benefit
test.
it
says,
not
that,
some
total
costs
come
in
and
you
look
to
see
what
the
resulting
social
benefits
are
going
to
be.
and
we
believe
that
the
word
benefits
here
means
social
benefits
because
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
clearly
that
congress
wanted
unemployment
effects
and
impacts
on
the
local
economy
to
be
considered.
now,
if
you
make
that
showing,
that
still
doesn't
get
you
home
free.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit
recognized
that.
it
showed
you've
got
to
bring
in
evidence
under
the
other
statutory
criteria.
there
are
other
factors
in
there
too.
this
is
just
one
of
them.
and
viewing
them
all
as
a
whole,
you
have
the
right
to
try
to
persuade
epa
or
the
state
that
a
different
limitation
represents
best
practical
technology
for
your
plant.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
sir,
we
don't
know
how
many
people
are
adversely
affected
here.
if
you
will
compare--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--i
do
not
challenge
those
figures
as
being
figures
in
the
record.
but
i
will
ask
the
court,
along
that
line,
to
compare
the
meticulous
subcategorization
which
epa
went
through
with
for
the
paper
industry
in
weyerhaeuser
with
the
sort
of
hit-or-miss,
few-sample-plant
type
of
subcategorization
they
went
through
in
the
crushed
stone
industry
and
in
the
coal
industry.
and
that's
spelled
out
in
our
brief.
what
this
variance
clause
is
all
about,
it
permits
epa
because
of
the
time
pressures
involved
in
issuing
those
'77
regulations
to
make
the
kinds
of
oversimplifications
and
generalizations
that
it
has
to
make
to
issue
those
industry-wide
regulations.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
oh,
sir,
i
think
that
would
suggest
that
the
regulations
were
probably
all
right.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
well,
but
the
regulations
meet
one
test.
at
the
permit-setting
stage
what
we
are
looking
for
is
to
see
whether
or
not
those
general
regulations
which
were
roughly
set
will
create
an
anomaly
under
the
statutory
criteria
that
will
not
make
it
best
available
controlled
technology
at
this
particular
plant.
if
the
plant
is
going
to
be
closed
down,
if
one
of
our
coal
mines
is
going
to
be
closed
down,
all
the
miners
that
work
at
the
mine
are
put
out
of
work,
the
one
town
that
is
dependent
upon
them
bankrupted,
and
if
we
can
show
through
other
evidence
that
the
limitation
that
epa
is
proposing
here
at
that
particular
mine
not
only
will
have
that
economic
effect
but
it
won't
do
the
water
or
the
fish
or
people
or
anybody
any
good,
then
we
think
that
in
that
special
circumstance
the
variance
clause
is
supposed
to
allow
epa
to
correct
on
a
case-by-case
basis
for
the
overgeneralization
that
it
had
to
go
through
in
issuing
these
regulations--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--i
didn't
in
any
way
understand
him
to
say
that.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
and
i
know
that
in
the
cases
that
i've
had
where
i
have
tried
to
present
evidence
of
those
economic
effects,
that
epa
clearly
will
exclude
it.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--well,
sir,
i
ask
you
to
look
at
their
reply
brief--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--well,
sir,
if
he
said
that,
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
it's
contrary
to
the
position
set
forth
in
footnote
9
of
his
reply
brief
where
he
makes
it
clear
that--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--that
evidence
would
not
be
admissible
in
a
variance
proceeding.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
would
say
this,
sir.
the
way
i
took
his
reference
to
mean,
because
my
problem
is,
i've
argued
this
thing
over
and
over
again
and
i
get
different
examples
each
time...
it
is
not
our
argument...
and
maybe
he's
saying
here,
if
all
you
can
show
is
that
you
are
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
if
you
have
to
comply
with
the
regulations,
you
get
pushed
off
the
cliff
under
our
theory
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
theory,
you
get
pushed
off
the
cliff.
you
have
to
show
something
more.
so
what's
at
issue
here
is,
do
we
have
evidence...
do
we
have
the
right
in
a
variance
proceeding
to
show
that
we're
going
to
get
pushed
off
the
cliff
as
well
as
to
show
that
we
shouldn't
be
pushed
off
the
cliff
because
of
the
other
statutory
factors
as
well
in
304(b)(1)(b)?
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
in
a
variance
clause
proceeding.
that
is
the
logic
of
their
position
and--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--it's
what
they
state
clearly
time
and
time
again.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
well,
we
have
pointed
out,
sir,
and
in
certain
cases
of
inconsistency
on
epa's
part...
because
one
of
the
things
that
it
has
argued
here
is
the
presumption
of
validity
to
its
own
regulation,
which
changes
daily,
but,
in
some
of
the
cases,
we
pointed
out
that
they
had
admitted
evidence
of
that.
and
in
footnote
9
to
their
reply
brief,
they
said,
yes,
there
was
such
a
case.
but
the
evidence
was
admitted
over
our
objection
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
our
interpretation
and
reading
of
our
regulations.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
well,
it's
allowing
it
in...
it's
being
allowed
in
by
a
hearing
examiner
over
the
objections
of
counsel
for
the
agency.
but
the
whole
reason
this
case
is
before
this
court...
and
i
will
say
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
whatsoever
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case
and
the
4th
circuit
cases...
they
both
read
the
regulation
and
they
both
read
this
court's
opinion
in
dupont
as
requiring
epa
in
a
variance
clause
proceeding
to
admit
evidence
under
all
of
the
statutory
factors
that
it
had
to
consider
when
it
set
the
regulations.
and
that
means
everything
that's
in
304(b)(1)(b).
and--
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
freeman,
jr.
if
i
may
have...
yes,
sir...
well,
if
i
may
address
that
because
i
think
you
are
wrong,
and
i
think
what
happened
is
that
the
d.
c.
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
4th
circuit
arrived
at
the
same
point,
namely
that
all
of
this
evidence
under
304(b)(1)(b)
had
to
be
considered.
they
both
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
evidence
of
affordability
was
relevant
to
total
cost,
that
component
in
the
cost/benefit
test
that's
in
304(b)(1)(b).
the
4th
circuit
following...
you
remember,
it
started
this
whole
thing
with
dupont...
and
it
looked
mainly
in
dupont
not
to
legislative
history
but
to
the
overall
scheme
of
the
act
to
see
whether
epa
had
this
implied
authority
to
issue
the
regulations
in
the
first
place.
it
started
in
appalachian;
two
months
after
it
decided
dupont
it
picked
up
right
where
it
was
and
said,
looking
at
the
overall
scheme
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
we
think
the
concept
of
affordability...
that
is,
evidence
of
affordability...
clearly
ought
to
be
admissible
under
total
cost
because
otherwise
you
would
have
the
anomalous
situation
of
being
able
to
get
away
to
have
it
considered
under
the
more
stringent
limitation
without
having
it
taken
into
account
under
'77.
we
think
that
the
reference
in
the
4th
circuit
opinions
in
appalachian
has
to
be
viewed
in
that
context,
that
is,
its
reference
to
301(c)
said
that
evidence
of
affordability
has
to
be
considered
under
the
statutory
criteria
language
of
total
cost
in
relation
to
resulting
effluent
benefit.
and
it's
clear
to
us
that
weyerhaeuser
reached
that
point
a
different
way,
because
it
had
benefit
of
your
decision
in
dupont
and
the
benefit
of
epa's
shift
in
its
interpretation
of
the
regulations
to
permit
the
consideration
of
economic
evidence.
so
it
simply
took
the
shorthand
route
and
looked
at
legislative
history
with
regard
to
total
cost.
