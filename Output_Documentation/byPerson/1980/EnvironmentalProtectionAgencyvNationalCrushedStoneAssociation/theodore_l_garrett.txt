mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
i'll
address
it
now,
since
it
seems
to
be
on
your
mind.
it
is
true
that
the
variance
clause
as
it
was
contained
in
the
regulations
before
the
4th
circuit
had
a
certain
amount
of
vagueness
to
it.
it
talked
about
fundamentally
different
factors
without
indicating
what
those
were.
and
indeed,
when
we
argued
the
case
in
the
4th
circuit,
one
of
the
problems
that
we
had
with
the
variance
clause
is
that
it
was
vague.
you
couldn't
tell
what
the
grounds
were
for
the
granting
of
a
bpt
variance.
now,
with
respect
to
the
ripeness
question,
i
think
that
that
problem
has
been
solved
because
epa
in
1979
published
regulations
under
its
mpds
program
applicable
to
all
industries
and
specifying
in
detail
what
factors
will
and
will
not
be
considered
in
granting
a
variance.
you
can
look
at
40
cfr,
section
125.31,
and
in
particular
section
31(e).
in
that
provision
of
epa's
regulations,
which
are
binding
on
the
agency
and
express
its
position,
state
unequivocally
that
the
inability
of
a
particular
plant
to
afford
costs
of
compliance
will
not
be
grounds
for
a
variance.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the
agency's
regulations
say
not,
and
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
preamble
to
the
agency's
1979
regulations,
it
makes
it
absolutely
clear.
the
regulations
say
that
a
variance
will
only
be
considered
if
there
are
fundamentally
different
factors.
and
the
agency's
regulations
go
on
to
state
that
economic
affordability
under
no
circumstances
can
be
considered
fundamentally
different.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
yes.
this
is
for
the
1977
variance.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i
believe
that's
right.
of
course,
the
agency's
position
is
that
301(c)
supersedes
its
variance
clause
for
'33.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
it
would
be
consistent
with
its
own
regulations
and
the
agency
would
be
bound
to
follow
those
regulations.
it's
our
position
that
the
agency's
regulations
are
invalid
and
that's
why
we're
before
the
court.
otherwise
we
would
have
a
situation
where
this
very
issue
before
the
court
would
be
litigated
in
hundreds
of
individual
proceedings
and
indeed
it's
not
clear
that
it
could
be
litigated,
because
epa's--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
what
i
made
of
it
is
that
if
there
was
a
technological
factor--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--my
understanding,
and
i
think
it's
better
addressed
to
the
epa
counsel--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--as
to
the
costs,
but
not
as
to
affordability.
in
other
words,
if
you
can
show
that
the
costs
are
so
high
that
it
would
force
the
plant
to
close--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
i
guess
all
i
can
suggest
is
that
you
read
epa's
regulations
as
i
just
cited
them.
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
on
their
face--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
i
think
that
you'd
better
ask
him.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i
had
understood
it
in
a
different
way.
i
understood
him
to
be
saying
that
they
would
consider
costs
but
not
the
question
of
affordability.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
what
i
understand
the
brief
to
say.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
government
could
show
that
it
were
not
more
expensive
for
some
strange
reason,
then
the
affordability
question
would
be
irrelevant
and
he
might
not
be
entitled
to
a
variance.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
yes
and
no.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
our
position
has
consistently
been
that
you
have
to
consider
a
number
of
factors
so
that
that
one
factor--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--secondly,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
size
of
the
plant
alone--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
let's
say
that
the
large
company
concludes
that
by
virtue
of
imposition
of
these
added
costs
that
it
becomes
uneconomical
to
operate
that
plant,
whether
it
be
a
crushed
stone
facility
or
some
other
facility.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
my
only
point
is
that
it
might
be
a
relevant
distinction
and
it
might
not.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
my
point
is
it's
always
relevant.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
it's
always
relevant.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it's--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--that's
our
understanding
of
their
position.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
our
position
is
that
it
would
always
be
relevant.
i
understood
the
question
to
be
whether
or
not
it
would
be
dispositive,
and
i'm
sorry
for
the
confusion.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
i
just
think
that
all
other
factors
being
equal
it
might
be
dispositive,
yes,
recognizing
the
fact
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
that
the
agency
has
and
that
it's
hard
to
find
two
plants
that
are
in
identical
circumstances
with
respect
to
the
impact
on
receiving
waters
and
other
factors.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the
difficulty
that
we
have
with
the
agency's
regulations
is
that
the
agency
says
that
it
will
grant
the
variance
based
on
a
number
of
factors,
and
they
enumerate
them,
including
engineering,
process
factors,
land
availability,
and
so
forth.
yet
the
one
issue
that
they...
as
we
understand
it...
refuse
to
consider
in
current
permits
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
discharger
can
pay
for
the
required
control
equipment.
the
agency
will
not
consider
the
issue
even
if
the
resulting
controls
will
result
in
no
benefit
to
the
environment.
now,
the
agency
says,
oh,
yes,
we'll
consider
financial
inability
as
a
factor
in
1984
but
not
now.
this
is
hardly
any
consolation
to
a
plant
that's
forced
to
close
now
because
they
cannot
afford
bpt
permit
requirements.
now,
shakespeare
once
said,
"those
who
die
seldom
do,
or
never
recover.
"
we
submit
that
it's
totally
arbitrary
for
epa
that
it
will
consider
every
relevant
factor
except
the
one
that
means
the
very
survival
or
extinction
of
a
company.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
tradition
of
fair
play
in
america
that
allows
persons
to
be
heard
on
matters
of
significance.
and
i
think
that
epa's
position
here
is
at
odds
with
that
tradition.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
contress
would
have
delegated
to
epa
the
authority
to
shut
down
a
plant
without
a
hearing
at
least
on
this
issue,
not
in
cases
where
they
are
in
clear
violation
of
that
law,
not
in
a
situation
where
a
plant
is
endangering
human
health,
but
simply
because
a
small
businessman
cannot
obtain
financing
or
otherwise
afford
the
cost
involved.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
said
about
the
statutory
structure.
i'd
like
to
simply
make
a
couple
of
points
regarding
that.
the
1977
standard
is
supposed
to
be
practicable
and
in
turn
the
agency
notes
that
it's
not
anticipated
that
large
numbers
of
plants
will
be
forced
to
close
as
a
result
of
bpt.
in
contrast,
by
1984,
the
standards
are
supposed
to
be
more
stringent
and
reflect
the
best
available
technology
economically
achievable,
and
to
ensure
that
firms
will
not
be
forced
to
close.
congress
provided
in
section
301(c)
for
an
explicit
variance
from
the
1984,
or
the
government
refers
to
them
as
the
1987
limits
on
grounds
of
affordability.
now
there
are
two
key
respects
in
which
the
regulations
depart
from
this
scheme
and
in
turn
those
departures
relate
to
two
independent
grounds
for
affirming
the
decision
below.
first
of
all,
epa's
initial
bpt
regulations
often
go
very
far
beyond
what
is
practicable.
in
the
case
of
the
crushed
stone
industry,
for
example,
epa
adopted
bpt
regulations
that
require
zero
discharge
of
process
water,
and
they
publish
the
identical
regulations
planned
for
the
1984
standards.
now,
contrary
to
the
government's
suggestion
that
the
regulations
were
upheld
in
all
respects,
certainly
the
4th
circuit
found
that
in
major
respects
the
crushed
stone
regulations
were
unreasonable.
the
crushed
stone
industry
contains
hundreds
of
small
privately
owned
businesses.
and
epa's
regulations
would
close
many
plants
that
cannot
afford
the
costs
involved.
we
strenuously
disagree
with
government
counsel
that
the
costs
were
fully
considered
by
the
agency
or
that
the
impact
would
be
small.
and
on
that,
i
would
point
out
a
couple
of
factors
since
it's
been
brought
up
as
an
issue
this
morning.
the
agency
acknowledges
that
the
greatest
impact
of
its
regulations
will
fall
on
small
plants.
indeed,
the
agency
predicted
that
there
would
be
35
closures
within
its
small
plant
category.
its
economic
analysis
had
several
categories
of
plants,
the
smallest
of
which
was
the
so-called
small
plant
category,
and
this
consisted
of
a
100,000
ton-per-year
plant.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
justice
burger,
but
it's
relevant
with
respect
to
epa's
economic
analysis,
and
the
adequacy
of
that
analysis,
that
on-third
of
the
industry...
some
1,600
companies...
are
composed
of
plants
that
produce
less
than
25,000
tons
per
year,
far
smaller
than
studied
by
epa
even
in
its
smallest
small
plant
economic
analysis.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
category
of
plants
that
was
never
studied
by
epa.
we
believe
that
many
small
plants
in
this
industry
will
have
a
financial
position
that
is
significantly
different
from
that
studied
by
the
agency.
and
if
epa's
position
is
upheld
today,
then
plants
in
this
subcategory
will
never
have
a
chance
to
have
epa
or
state
or
anyone
consider
whether
they're
fundamentally
different
in
this
respect.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well,
we
suggest
that
there's
a
delegation
problem
that
could
be
avoided
if
the
statute's
interpreted
our
way.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i
think
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
but
i--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--that
is
the
issue.
i
would
just
simply
point
out
that,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
i
can't
conceive
that
congress
intended
to
delegate
to
epa
the
power
to
make
these
kinds
of
decisions
without
considering
this
factor
and
without
even
affording
the
company
an
opportunity
for
hearing.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
well--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--not
as
such,
although
the
issue
is
going
to
surface
in
one
proceeding
or
the
other,
which
was
getting
to
my
second
point.
there
is
a
relationship
here,
an
interrelationship
between
the
setting
of
the
national
standards
and
the
allowance
of
a
variance.
the
courts
have
in
many
cases
upheld
national
regulations
considering
epa's
data
base
and
the
way
in
which
epa
evaluated
the
evidence
on
the
grounds
that,
well,
maybe
this
was
less
than
perfect,
but
in
situations
where
it
isn't
perfect,
where
there
might
be
a
taking
or
there
might
be
a
problem
of
insufficient
consideration
for
statutory
factors,
that'll
be
accounted
for
in
the
variance
procedure.
the
implications
of
epa's
positions,
it
seems
to
me,
are
going
to
be
to
put
an
enormous
burden
on
the
initial
regulation-setting
stage,
because
if
companies
realize
that
the
possibility
of
a
variance
is
really
illusory,
that
epa
has
to
have
done
superb
economic
analysis
in
the
first
instance,
otherwise
they're
never
going
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
affordability,
you're
going
to
have
extensive
litigation
and
rule-making
proceedings
on
the
extent
to
which
epa
conducted
an
adequate
economic
analysis.
it
seems
to
us
that
at
some
stage
these
issues
must
be
considered.
now,
the
agency's
justification
apparently
is
that
since
the
statute
allows
for
a
variance
and
for
bat
in
1984,
and
it's
silent
for
bpt
as
to
1977,
that
that's
dispositive
on
the
question.
we
submit
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
such
a
result
and
that
the
decision
of
the
4th
circuit
should
be
upheld.
thank
you.
