he
has
to
also
say,
i
have
made
reasonable
progress
over
the
'77
limitations,
and
if
the
'77
limitations
are
the
same
as
the
'87
limitations,
he
can't
get
a
variance
under
those
circumstances.
justice
stevens
but
there
really
can't
be
a
hypothetical
case,
can
there,
in
which
anybody
could
get
a
variance
under
the
'87
limitations,
who
has
complied
with
the
'77
in
this
industry?
justice
stevens
before
you
finish,
will
you
tell
me
the
statutory
source
of
the
variance
authority
under
the
'77
limitations?
justice
stevens
--mr.
freeman,
it
seems
to
me
we've
got
another
problem
that
we
haven't
talked
about
yet.
justice
stevens
at
one
stage
of
the
proceeding
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
affordability
was
a
sufficient
ground
for
a
variance.
another
stage
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
affordability
was
relevant
at
all.
now
you're
telling
us
that
they
won't
even
admit
evidence
of
unaffordability
to
be
received
in
a
proceeding.
and
one
of
the
problems
i
have
is,
we're
dealing
with
a
regulation
and
not
a
specific
concrete
dispute,
and
i'm
seriously
concerned
about
the
question
of
whether
the
controversy
is
ripe.
and
one
of
the
reasons
is,
i
think
you
kind
of
shift
the
arguments
as
the
proceeding
goes,
and
your
point
about
whether
or
not
there
is
disagreement
between
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.
c.
circuit
and
the
4th
circuit
emphasizes
that
to
my
mind.
i
have
difficulty
knowing
whether--
justice
stevens
it
has
to...
for
it
to
be
a
relevant
factor
it
has
to
be
decisive
in
some
cases.
now,
i
gave
you
a
marginal
case
and
see
if
you're
not
saying
that
in
that
marginal
case
the
small
company
gets
it
and
the
big
one
does
not?
justice
stevens
all
other
factors
are
neutral
except
affordability
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
the
capital
structure
of
the
company.
those
plants
are
physically
identical
in
my
case.
justice
stevens
you
keep
changing
my
example.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
how
anything
could
be
relevant
but
never
be
dispositive.
if
it's
the
only
differentiating
factor
between
two
otherwise
comparable
cases.
seems
to
me
it's
either
dispositive
or
it's
then
irrelevant;
one
of
the
two.
justice
stevens
would
the
government
be
satisfied
if
we
adopted
the
formulation
of
the
problem
of
the
d.c.
circuit
with
which
you
say
this
4th
circuit
is
in
conflict?
justice
stevens
does
the
cost
of
compliance
include
capital
costs?
interest
costs?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
not
in
whether
there's
financing,
but
in
determining
costs,
are
capital
costs
an
item
that
you're
looking
at?
which
in
turn
may
vary
from
company
to
company,
as
you
know.
