you
do
concede
that
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
1977
limitations
does
require
the
agency
to
weigh
the
total
cost
to
the
industry?
justice
stewart
and
if
the
figures
were
such
as
suggested
by
the
chief
justice
as
a
hypothetical
question,
that
could
affect
the
total...
that
could
affect...
the
total
cost
to
the
industry?
justice
stewart
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
if
the
reason
a
particular
component
of
the
industry
cannot
is
a
financial
reason,
your
claim
is
that
they
do
not
and
need
not
grant
a
variance,
period.
justice
stewart
and
that's
the
issue,
and
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
claim
you
have
a
duty
to
grant
a
variance.
justice
stewart
mr.
garrett,
you
don't
make
any
constitutional
argument
in
this
care,
do
you?
justice
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
a
matter
entirely
of
statutory
construction.
justice
stewart
i
thought
that's
what
the
issues
were.
justice
stewart
but
there's
no
due
process
argument,
or
there's
no
argument
that
there's
a
taking
without
compensation,
or
anything
like
that.
justice
stewart
is
there
or
isn't
there?
