justice

paul
stevens
it
is
true
is
it
not
that
there
are
more
federal
interest
in
this
particular
controversy
than
in
most
of
the
cases
that
you're
describing
because
of
the
source
of
the
gas
and
the
special
federal
statute
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
sort
of
a
unique
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gressman,
when
would
you
predict
that
the
issue
would
be
finally
resolved
if
the
alternative
route
is
taken
rather
than
ruling
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
assuming
that
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings
--
motion
of
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings
has
merit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
quite
a
difference
in
time
and
in
interest
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
just
making
that
assumption
for
purposes
preparing
the
relative
value,
the
two
different
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
evidentiary
hearing
is
probably
rather
brief
if
you
grant
the
judgment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
smith's
argument
is
valid,
what
--
why
do
you
need
all
the
evidence
for?
i
don't
know,
maybe
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
suppose
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
had
the
impression,
it's
really
fairly
simple.
if
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
gas
that
comes
from
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
not
consumed
in
louisiana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
most
of
the
gas
goes
through
a
processing
plant
then
shipped
out-of-state,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
tax
is
applied
on
all
that
gas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
situations
even
if
the
act
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
is
equal
to
the
severance
tax
that's
imposed
on
the
gas
that
originates
from
louisiana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
its
clear
isn't
it
that
there
is
no
tax
on
processing
of
gas
that
originates
in
louisiana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
process
--
you
call
this
a
processing
tax.
the
only
time
it's
imposed
is
on
the
gas
that
originates
out-of-state
and
it's
consumed
out-of-state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
processing
tax
a
state
seeks
to
impose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
those
are
determined
entirely
by
the
source
and
the
destination
of
the
gas
rather
than
the
character
of
the
processing
or
the
use.
justice
stevens
in
the
refund
actions
pending
in
the
state
courts,
is
there
any
claim
made
that
the
tax
is
not
do
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
stevens
i
should
have
said
state
law.
justice
stevens
under
the
taxing
statute
itself.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
is
there
a
claim
that
the
tax
was
not
payable
under
the
statute?
justice
stevens
but
it's
--
but
it's
the
entire
attack
is
on
the
validity
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
there's
no
argument
about
whether
the
statute
applies
to
processing
or
the
transportation
anything
like
that.
justice
stevens
you
don't
confess
error
around
the
state
law
i
point,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
stevens
you
don't
confess
error
around
the
state
law.
justice
stevens
mr.
pugh,
what
do
you
think
the
major
factual
issue
that
has
to
be
decided
is?
justice
stevens
that's
the
major
factual
issue
you've
just
described.
