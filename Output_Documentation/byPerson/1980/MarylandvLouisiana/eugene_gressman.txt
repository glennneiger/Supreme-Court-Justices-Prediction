mr.
eugene
gressman
chief
justice
burger
and
it
may
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
louisiana
primarily
as
expressed
in
its
pending
motion
to
dismiss
that
this
suit
simply
does
not
belong
at
this
juncture
and
with
the
parties
involved
on
the
original
docket
of
this
court.
there
are
innumerable
jurisdictional
standing
and
prudential
problems
that
plague
this
case.
but
the
primary
consideration
that
i
think
should
control
the
disposition
of
the
case
is
the
prudential
declination
standard
expressed
in
ohio
v.
wyandotte
chemicals
company,
and
more
particularly,
arizona
versus
new
mexico.
now,
mr.
sachs
has
indicated
that
the
ohio
v.
wyandotte
principle,
whereby
this
court
may
in
its
discretion
decline
to
exercise
a
case
that
is
otherwise
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
where
there
is
an
alternative
form
in
which
the
identical
issues
can
be
brought,
should
somehow
not
apply
in
that
branch
of
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
between
two
or
more
states.
now
granted,
ohio
v.
wyandotte
was
a
suit
under
the
other
branch
of
this
court's
original
but
concurrent
jurisdiction
as
between
a
state
and
citizens
of
another
state.
but
if
any
question
were
raised
as
mr.
sachs
seems
to
have
raised,
that
the
same
principle
of
declination
in
terms
of
the
very
practical
and
jurisprudential
considerations
set
forth
in
wyandotte,
if
there's
any
question
that
that
--
those
considerations
apply
equally
to
suits
between
two
or
more
states,
that
was
set
to
rest
by
the
case
of
arizona
versus
new
mexico,
which
is
virtually
on
all
fours
with
the
situation
that
is
presented
to
this
court
today.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
is
for
various
reasons
but
i
don't
think
we
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
discretionary
declination
which
encompasses,
in
this
case,
additional
considerations
which
i
think
put
this
case
beyond
the
pale
of
this
court's
original
jurisdiction,
even
though
it
is
nominally
a
suit
between
two
or
more
states.
i
think
one
may
start
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor,
that
is
one
of
our
basic
propositions
that
there
is
no
controversy,
no
--
between
the
sovereign
interest
of
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
sovereign
interest
of
the
state
of
maryland
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
if
there
does,
in
terms
of
invoking
this
court's
original
jurisdiction.
now,
what
the
real
controversy
here
is
all
about
and
it's
very
simple.
this
is
a
suit
involving
a
controversy
over
the
tax
refund
claims
of
the
private
pipeline
taxpayers
and
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
states,
the
plaintiff
states
have
sought
to
volunteer
to
adjudicate
and
secure
relief
in
this
court
for
the
private
refund
claims
of
the
taxpayer
of
the
pipeline
companies.
look
for
a
moment
at
what
this
complaint
filed
by
the
state
of
maryland
asked.
it
asked
that
the
--
this
court
declare
unconstitutional,
the
louisiana
first-use
tax
and
that
it
enjoin
the
collection
of
that
tax
from
the
private
pipeline
taxpayers.
and
then
the
last
clause
on
the
relief
paragraph
asked
that
this
court
order
the
state
of
louisiana
to
refund
taxes
paid
to
the
pipeline
companies.
now,
there
is
not
one
word.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
indeed.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
true.
there
are
so
many
states
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
but
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
(inaudible)
that
would
go
to
the
benefit
of
consumers.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
not
in
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
but
that
is
a
proprietary
interest,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
so
declared
and
that
brings
us
right
back
to
the
proposition
that
was
stated
as
recently
in
pennsylvania,
new
jersey,
that
it
has
become
subtle
doctrine
that
a
state
has
standing
to
sue
only
when
it's
sovereign
or
quasi-sovereign
interest
are
implicated.
and
it
is
not
merely
litigating
as
a
volunteer
the
personal
claims
of
its
citizens.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
but
the
interest
that
it
is
asserting
there,
that
is
the
cost,
the
burden
of
the
tax
that
has
somehow
been
passed
on
by
reason
of
some
authority
other
than
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
state
of
louisiana
has
not
insisted
in
its
tax
statute
that
this
tax
be
passed
on.
this
tax
could've
been
absorbed
by
the
--
by
the
taxpayers
or
it
could've
been
passed
on
to
some
other
entity,
but
with
the
approval
and
authority
of
the
federal
energy
authorities
it
has
been
passed
on
the
consumer.
now,
the
fact
is
that
the
states
of
maryland
and
the
other
states
have
only
the
common
interest
that
every
consumer
has
when
it
purchases
a
product.
in
other
words,
the
interest
that
the
state
of
maryland
asserts
here
is
no
end
as
a
consumer
of
gas
is
no
different,
is
no
more
sovereign
in
its
characteristic
than
the
interest
of
the
maryland
housewife
who
purchases
gas
from
the
same
pipeline
operations.
in
fact,
they
are
suing
precisely
on
behalf
of
all
the
gas
consumers,
personal
gas
consumers
in
the
state
of
maryland.
now,
i
suggest
that
that
does
not
--
that
standing
as
a
--
as
a
proposition
of
invoking
the
very
serious
jurisdiction
of
this
court
under
article
iii
over
controversies
between
two
or
more
states
simply
does
not
encompass
a
controversy
where
no
sovereign
interest
of
the
state,
of
the
plaintiff
state
are
involved
in
the
litigation.
and
it
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
the
same
could
be
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
is
obviously
a
burden
but
it's
a
burden
that
consumers
have
had
to
pay
from
the
year
one.
there
is
no
getting
around
it.
now,
the
question
is
how
can
you
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
state
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
understand
exactly
what
you're
saying,
justice
marshall.
the
point,
however,
is
that,
that
money,
that
injury
or
burden
as
you
will
has
never
been
elevated,
so
far
as
i
know,
into
any
kind
of
a
cause
of
action.
a
consumer
simply
does
not
have
any
recognizable
cause
of
action
to
bring
suit
against
to
some
other
state
who
happens
to
have
imposed
a
tax
upon
a
taxpayer
or
a
manufacturer
of
a
product.
mr.
eugene
gressman
which
then
the
manufacturer
by
economic
forces
or
otherwise,
passes
on
to
the
consumer.
we
--
we
purchase
today
--
everything
we
purchase
as
a
consumer
is
literally
composed
of
hundreds,
if
not
thousands
of
hidden
taxes
that
have
been
passed
on
to
us
as
consumers.
and
to
open
the
door
of
the
judiciary
to
suits
brought
by
consumers
with
no
greater
interest
than
that,
i
think
it
would
bring
chaos
upon
the
federal
court
system.
and
it
would
be
doubly
chaotic
to
open
the
doors
of
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
over
suits
between
states
simply
because
a
state
which
purchases
hundreds
of
thousands
of
products
in
the
course
of
its
operations
happens
to
find
a
hidden
tax,
so-called,
in
one
of
the
products
that
it
purchases
for
its
use
in
heating
the
state
capital
building.
and
therefore,
can
bring
a
suit
before
this
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
taxing
state
statute.
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
controversy
that
this
court
set
in
ohio
v.
wyandotte
should
not
be
involved
in
the
original
docket
of
this
court.
justice
harlan,
in
pointing
out
the
sum
of
the
prudential
factors
that
underlie
the
principle
of
declination
expressed
in
wyandotte
pointed
as
a
prime
example
the
innumerable
suit
that
exist
in
this
country,
innumerable
controversies,
let
me
say,
between
private
citizens
and
a
tax
--
taxing
authority.
and
if
you
open
the
door
of
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
to
the
--
any
state
acting
solely
as
a
consumer
to
come
before
you
and
assault
and
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
of
a
sister
state,
a
state
tax
statute
of
a
sister
state,
i
suggest
that
--
that
this
would
be
disruptive
of
this
court's
valuable
time
and
energies
which,
as
justice
harlan
so
well
pointed
out,
are
as
a
matter
of
national
policy
and
judicial
policy
much
better
devoted
to
cases
on
its
appellate
docket.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course,
there
are.
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
are
but
perhaps
the
answer
that
can
be
given
to
all
those
interests
lies
in
the
various
causes
of
action
that
are
pending
and
available
in
other
courts.
there,
it
is
significant
that
there
is
a
tax
refund
suit
in
the
state
of
louisiana
brought
by
the
taxpayers,
the
pipeline
companies.
it
is
significant
that
there
is
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
louisiana
brought
by
the
federal
authorities
where
they
can
assert
all
the
federal
interest
that
they
claim
are
at
issue
here.
indeed,
there
is
a
plethora
of
suits
brought
by
--
both
by
the
state
of
louisiana
and
more
particularly
by
the
various
pipeline
companies
and
taxpaying
interest
in
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
of
course,
but
that
involves
a
host
of
other
considerations
as
to
whether
this
case
could
ever
be
disposed
of
on
the
merits
--
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
without
any
kind
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
right,
well,
in
comparing
the
value
of
the
two
forum
or
sets
of
forums
that
are
available,
let
me
say
there
is
no
comparison.
i
think
every
consideration,
every
prudential,
every
judicial,
every
wise
principle
of
judicial
administration
would
suggest
that
the
--
is
so
far
greater
chances
of
securing
a
meaningful
kind
of
adjudication
of
these
constitutional
issues
in
the
state
courts
or
in
the
federal
courts
in
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
the
case
was
in
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
on
this
original
docket
where
you
have
to
extend
--
involve
yourself
in
evidentiary
hearings
before
a
special
master
can
well
take
many,
many
years.
now,
i
have
now
way
of
estimating
how
it
would
take
here
but
let
me
say
this.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
is
true
but
it
says
--
that
suggests
another
proposition,
and
maybe
so
brief
as
to
the
untrustworthy,
as
a
method
of
serious
constitutional
adjudication
determining
the
--
the
validity
of
a
state
tax
on
the
basis
of
pleadings.
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
hardly
disagree
that
--
that
you
can
even
define,
let
alone
resolve
the
constitutional
issues
by
looking
at
this
very
complex
and
in
many
respects,
ambiguous
statute.
the
very
basic
thing
i
want
is
missing
in
the
litigation
before
this
court
is
any
kind
of
authoritative
state
court
interpretation
of
what
this
statute
means
or
what
sections
of
it
have
been
and
have
applied
and
therefore
--
or
ripe
for
adjudication.
and
there
are
other
state
law
questions
that
have
been
raised
in
the
lower
courts
that
might
be
dispositive
of
this
entire
litigation
without
ever
reaching
the
constitutional
issues
that
the
plaintiff
so
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
there
are
various
difficulties
in
determining
which
section
of
the
statute
has
been
applied.
there
are
eight
alternative
users
that
--
that
might
be
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true
but
there
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
there
are
other
kinds
of
uses.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
depends
on
your
definition
and
then
what
method
is
selected
by
the
state
tax
authorities
to
impose
it.
now,
maybe
it's
a
--
at
the
processing
plant
or
is
it
on
the
as
to
gas
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
as
to
gas
as
it
comes
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
from
the
outer
continental
shell
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
and
--
but
much
of
the
problems
of
consideration
of
the
discriminatory
nature
of
this
tax
whether
there
is
indeed
what
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
on
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
--
that
involves
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right
but
the
problem
is
it
can
be
under
this
statute
as
to
which
of
various
processing
uses
are
being
attacked.
now,
there
--
and
out
of
--
once
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
it
may
depend
upon
contracts.
it
may
depend
upon
what
the
state
tax
authorities
conceive
of
as
the
use
that
is
being
exercised
or
utilized
by
the
assessor
and
how
the
--
and
various
other
propositions
which
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
in
jurisdictional
terms,
no.
i
can't
--
yes,
i
can
conceive
of
a
case
in
this
original
category
that
might
be
decided
on
the
pleadings.
but
that
doesn't
go
to
jurisdiction
or
it
might
go
to
some
prudential
requirement
or
consideration
as
to
whether
you
should
cut
off
evidentiary
hearings
rather
than
go
forward
on
a
summary
basis.
one
of
the
best
--
the
closest
example
i
can
find
of
that
nature
is
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia
where
west
virginia
had
enacted
the
statute
which
cut
off
all
exportation
of
natural
gas
from
west
virginia
into
pennsylvania.
now,
the
day
after
that
statute
was
enacted,
pennsylvania
and
ohio
were
in
this
court
seeking
a
declaration
of
the
invalidity
of
that
tax,
of
that
west
virginia
statute
before
it
even
became
effective,
which
ultimately
raised
a
good
deal
of
concern
on
the
part
of
mr.
justice
brandeis.
but
nonetheless,
the
court
did
take
the
case
and
did
decide
it
presumably
on
the
basis
of
the
reading
of
the
statute.
but
what
is
significant
even
there
was
that
the
court
felt
compelled
even
in
terms
of
just
reading
this
brand
new
statute
to
appoint
a
commissioner
who
held
extensive
hearings
in
pennsylvania
and
west
virginia,
prolonged
this
emergency
kind
of
review
of
the
phase
of
the
statute
for
some
--
two
years
before
this
court
ultimately
decided.
and
it
utilized
a
great
deal
of
evidence
accumulated
during
those
hearings
in
reading
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
you
will
find
that,
much
of
that
evidence
in
the
initial
part
of
that
opinion.
but
ultimately,
i
think
these
various
problems
need
not
be
confronted
or
resolved,
particularly
these
difficult
matters
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
need
not
be
resolved
because
of
the
overriding
concern
expressed
in
ohio
v.
wyandotte
that
this
court
has
committed.
the
major
part
of
its
resources
to
the
overwhelming
burden
that
we
all
know
exists
with
respect
to
appellate
docket
matters.
now,
the
consideration,
the
vital
consideration
in
determining
when
that
ohio
v.
wyandotte
principle
applies
is
dependency
of
some
kind
of
state
court
action
that
provides
inappropriate
forum
in
which
the
issues
tendered
here
may
be
litigated.
now,
as
expressed
in
arizona
v.
new
mexico,
the
emphasis
is
on
the
identity
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
here
in
an
original
complaint
with
those
that
are
available
for
adjudication
in
the
alternate
forum.
and
if
there
is
an
identity
of
those
issues,
then
they
--
that
can
be
adjudicated
and
if
any
federal
constitutional
issues
survive,
the
state
court
forum
review
of
the
matter,
then
of
course
they
can
be
brought
here
on
certiorari
or
appeal
on
the
appellate
docket.
now,
it
is
an
undenied
fact
that
every
issue
that
is
being
put
to
your
honors
by
the
plaintiff
states
as
supported
by
the
united
states
and
the
pipeline
companies
are
identical
to
the
jot
and
tittle
with
the
issues
that
are
involved
in
pending
litigation
in
the
state
courts
and
federal
courts
of
louisiana.
and
those
cases,
therefore,
make
it
appropriate.
dependency
of
those
cases,
makes
it
appropriate
for
this
court
to
stand
back
and
say,
“well,
why
should
we
devote
any
more
of
our
attention
to
this
case?”
even
apart
from
what
i
call
the
spurious
jurisdictional
allegations
here
in
terms
of
the
interest
asserted
on
behalf
of
consumer
states.
why
do
we
even
have
to
address
those
problems?
why
do
we
have
to
address
the
complicated
statutory
provisions
and
try
to
define
and
predict
what
the
state
court
might
interpret
them
to
mean
and
thereafter,
extract
out
the
relevant
constitutional
considerations
when
all
of
these
is
going
forward
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
in
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor,
and
i
will
simply
conclude
by
saying
that
the
arizona
v.
new
mexico
case
is
entirely
in
point
and
is
a
controlling
authority
or
what
i
deem
to
be
appropriate
the
dispositions
of
this
case,
a
declination,
a
refusal,
a
discretionary
determination
by
this
court
that
let
us
wait
until
all
of
these
issues
arise
and
come
up
to
us
through
the
regular
appellate
process.
now,
let
me
add
one
other
prudential
consideration
that
weighs
against
continuing
the
case,
this
constitutional
adjudication
in
this
case.
let
me
say
--
this
gets
back
to
some
of
the
jurisdictional
problems
that
justice
rehnquist
has
mentioned.
in
a
real
sense,
once
you
understand
whose
real
interest
are
involved
in
this
case
and
they
are
the
real
--
and
the
taxpayers,
the
private
taxpayer
citizens
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
in
this
suit,
in
this
court
to
obtain
a
tax
refund
on
--
for
their
benefit.
i
suggest
that
they
are
not
only
the
real
parties
and
interest
but
they
are
indispensable
parties
to
any
kind
of
effective
relief
or
adjudication
that
this
court
had
rendered.
and
yet
they
cannot
become
parties
to
this
court
without
destroying
this
jurisdiction.
because
once
a
private
party
is
--
comes
in
as
party
plaintiff
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
state
versus
state,
and
that
private
party
comes
through
intervention
but
whatever
the
needs,
joins
the
case
as
party
plaintiffs
then
that
would
be
in
direct
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment
which
withdraws
from
this
court
and
every
court
jurisdiction
over
a
suit
by
a
private
citizen
against
a
sovereign
state.
now,
i
suggest
that
there
has
been
no
waiver
here.
the
state
of
louisiana
has
never
consented
to
be
sued
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
doubt
if
it
would
be
effective
if
they
made
one
because
i
think
this
court's
article
iii
type
of
jurisdiction
over
--
between
suits,
between
states
is
not
easily
waivable
by
any
state.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
we
simply
do
not
have
the
real
parties
in
interest.
the
real
parties
to
this
controversy
as
parties
before
this
court,
they
are
parties
down
in
louisiana.
they
tend
to
consult
to
their
heart's
content
and
litigate
down
there
their
real
interest.
now,
the
--
the
other
thing
is
that
the
plaintiff
states
and
i
say,
if
they
have
this
consumer
interest
which
they
do,
i
think
can
express
that
interest
in
the
ongoing
litigation
in
the
louisiana
courts.
and
i
think
we
are
entitled
as
--
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
extend
to
the
state
of
maryland,
et
al.,
the
precise
type
of
invitation
that
the
attorney
general
of
missouri
extended
to
the
state
of
massachusetts,
whose
desire
to
litigate
in
a
controversy.
and
at
page
308
u.s.
at
page
20,
the
attorney
general
before
the
bar
of
this
court,
attorney
general
of
missouri
said
that
it
would
seem
that
massachusetts
should
be
able
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
trustees
for
collection
of
its
taxes
and
either
a
missouri
state
court
or
in
a
federal
district
court
in
missouri
and
that
such
a
suit
would
in
missouri
constitute
case
of
controversy.
so
too
i
think
the
state
of
louisiana
will
not
oppose
any
effort
by
the
state
of
maryland
to
present
its
interest
in
some
manner
before
the
pending
litigation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
have
the
assurance
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
am
making
it
now
and
i
--
it
is
also
been
made
before
the
state
courts
in
louisiana.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
because
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
that
is
not
entirely
correct.
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
pretrial
efforts.
we
have
filed
requests
for
admissions,
various
other
pretrial
information
has
been
sought,
but
the
basic
trouble
is
that
the
plaintiff
taxpayers
are
in
the
saddle
seat
as
plaintiffs
and
they
are
fully
capable
at
any
moment
to
move
forward
with
their
litigation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
that
is
--
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor,
and
mr.
pugh,
my
co-counsel
will
straighten
that
matter
out.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
so
that
--
without
further
ado,
i
will
give
--
i
will
give
mr.
pugh
the
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
