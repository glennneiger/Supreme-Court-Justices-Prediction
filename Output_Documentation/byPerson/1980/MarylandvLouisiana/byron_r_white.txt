justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
smith,
do
they
treat
all
producers
alike?
there
are
only
about
15%
of
the
producers
who
own
the
gas
when
it's
first
processed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
law
prevents
passing
back
to
the
producer
this
tax
whether
or
not
he
still
owns
the
gas
at
the
time
the
tax
is
first
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
made
the
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
ferc?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
was
there
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
evidence?
was
there
any
kind
of
affidavits
or
anything
else
or
is
it
strictly
on
the
pleadings?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
would
it
--
would
you
treat
this
as
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
or
what
would
you
treat
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
--
it's
only
if
there
were
evidence
offered
outside
the
pleading?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
any
--
has
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know,
you
wouldn't
--
what
if
the
commission
put
out
an
order
in
a
specific
case
allocating
these
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
isn't
--
why
isnt
that
sort
of
an
accommodation
by
the
commission
to
the
louisiana
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
smith
said
it
is
not
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say,
it's
just
in
northern
natural
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
infringement,
an
invasion
of
an
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
--
why
shouldn't
louisiana
be
able
to
impose
some
kind
of
a
tax
with
respect
to
the
processing
of
natural
gas
within
its
borders?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
didn't
attempt
to
control
who
ultimately
paid
it,
suppose
it
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
--
i
know
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
a
use
just
happens
to
be
a
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
one
of
them,
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
louisiana
be
able
impose
a
tax
with
respect
to
that
processing-use?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
barely
started
to
answer
my
question.
and
so
what
if
that's
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is
why
shouldn't
--
that's
an
activity
going
on
within
louisiana
and
i
suppose
that
louisiana
is
giving
it
some
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
it
--
why
shouldn't
that
part
of
the
interstate
movement
have
to
pay
either
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
plants,
they
have
plants?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
--
you
said
it
was
imposed
on
the
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
use
has
to
be
processing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
--
what
if
the
state
put
on
a
certain
rate
of
tax
for
every
--
every
unit
of
processing
of
gas
that
was
processed
whether
you
speak
in
trillions
or
billions
or
millions
or
whatever
it
is?
why
couldn't
the
state
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
--
within
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
but
you
say
processing
is
part
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
but
you
concede
that
it
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
that
kind
of
a
tax
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
nevertheless
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
changing
the
case
again.
i
want
to
put
aside
this
requirement
that
you
--
that
they
pass
along.
couldn't
louisiana
collect
a
tax
on
processing
even
though
that
processing
was
a
gas
that
was
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
in
the
course
of
being
transmitted
out-of-state?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
why
is
that?
interstate
commerce
pays
its
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
don't
--
you
don't
suggest
then
--
i
thought
you
were
going
to
just
these
cases
beyond
our
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
arguing
that
right
now.
you
are
arguing
this
--
the
principle
of
discretionary
declination.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
think
is
a
case
of
controversy
between
maryland
and
louisiana
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
that
isn't
quite
what
i
asked.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
whether
--
whether
there
was
a
case
of
controversy
between
the
two.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
any
conflict
of
sovereign
interest,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
also
wanted
to
declare
that
this
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
prospectively
even.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
part
of
it
would
be
prospective.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
you
don't
suggest
that
the
--
that
this
tax
doesn't
resolve
it,
increasing
the
cost
of
gas
to
the
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
state
of
maryland
have
a
state
in
the
controversy
then
substantially?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
itself
uses
gas,
doesn't
it?
so,
you
should
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
litigating
its
own
claims.
it's
litigating
--
in
part
at
least,
it's
litigating
its
claim
because
it
uses
gas
and
it's
paying
more
than
it
should
for
it
--
for
its
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
we
were
told
earlier
by
one
of
your
colleagues
that
the
louisiana
court
had
declined
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
has
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
couldn't
they,
by
the
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
they
have
been
sued?
could
you
--
could
you
have
made
them
defendants
in
your
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
united
states.
i
was
talking
about
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
have
to
start
out
before
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
they
ordered
--
if
they
ordered
the
producer
to
pay
some
of
this
tax,
you
might
--
your
tax
might
be
in
a
little
bit
of
trouble,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
know
you
can't
--
maryland
can't
be
in
there
litigating
with
louisiana.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me,
tell
me
why
or
perhaps
by
studying
the
legislative
history
carefully
enough,
i'd
know
why
the
--
why
the
--
why
is
the
provision
that
the
producer
is
not
to
pay
any
of
this
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then,
it's
all
right
to
ask
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
how
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
remember
what
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
put
it
again.
i'll
put
it
again.
what
was
the
--
what
is
the
reason
if
all
louisiana
is
trying
to
do
is
to
raise
some
revenue,
why
does
it
require
that
--
or
forbid
the
producer
to
pay
any
of
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
lobbied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
that
guarantees
that
the
pipelines
are
going
to
pay
under
louisiana
law
and
the
pipelines
may
be
passing
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
the
commission
is
suggesting
that
--
that
you're
infringing
--
louisiana's
infringing
on
its
territory
by
even
purporting
to
try
to
allocate
these
costs.
justice
byron
r.
white
mister,
it
sounds
to
me
what
your
argument
really
is
and
--
is
that
we
should
--
rather
than
just
let
this
case
go
on,
we
should
really
dismiss
it
here.
