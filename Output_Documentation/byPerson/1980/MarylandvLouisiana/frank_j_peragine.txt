mr.
frank
j.
peragine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
in
behalf
of
the
17
interstate
natural
gas
pipeline
companies
that
have
sought
to
intervene
in
this
case.
those
pipelines
are
all
regulated
by
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
we
are
involved
in
this
case
because
it
is
we,
who
buy
the
offshore
gas,
bring
it
into
louisiana
in
our
pipeline
systems,
and
take
it
beyond
louisiana
in
the
most
--
in
most
cases,
just
approximately
97.5
%.
we
are
the
owners
of
the
offshore
gas
as
we
bring
it
into
the
state
of
louisiana
and
we
are
the
owners
when
it
is
subjected
to
the
so-called
uses
which
trigger
the
first-use
tax.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
yes
we
have,
sir.
we
have
sued
because
we
are
required
to
in
the
sense
that
if
we
don't
sue
for
refund
of
the
taxes
that
we
have
paid
under
protest,
then
it's
--
we've
lost
that
money.
so
the
louisiana
statutory
procedure
provides
that
if
youre
going
to
contest
this
tax,
you
must
pay
it
under
protest
and
sue
for
refund
and
that's
what
we
have
done.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
if
we
have
been
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
presumably,
yes.
yes,
sir.
i
can't
disagree
with
that,
sir.
we
are,
as
owners
of
the
gas,
the
tax
of
course
is
in
imposed
on
us.
we
are
subject
to
severe
penalties
if
we
do
not
pay
the
tax
including
seizure
of
the
gas
as
contraband.
and
as
i've
already
mentioned,
we're
paying
it
under
protest.
meanwhile
--
meanwhile,
the
ferc
has
permitted
to
pass
through
of
most
of
the
tax
that
we
pay
through
our
jurisdictional
customers.
in
other
words,
we
--
we
have
a
tracking
mechanism
and
we
can
get
that
tax
back
as
we
--
the
money
paid
for
that
tax,
we
are
recovering
it
now
from
the
ultimate
customers
in
other
words.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well
you
speak
of
it
as
an
accommodation,
sir.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well,
if
i
may
address
that
point,
justice
white
for
a
moment,
you
have
here
--
let's
say
the
commission
does
issue
an
order
saying,
“we're
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
this
non
pass
back
provision,”
which
is
the
brunt
of
the
government's
argument
here
as
to
1303c.
what
we
have
there
in
that
situation,
sir,
is
the
wording
of
the
louisiana
statute
comes
into
play.
it
says,
only
if
1303
is
declared
to
be
unenforceable
by
a
final
judgment
of
a
court,
then
if
it
is,
then
the
entire
statute
self-destructs.
but
in
the
situation
which
your
honor
poses,
sir,
you
would
not
have
a
final
unappealable
judgment
of
a
competent
--
of
a
court
of
any
jurisdiction.
you
would
have
merely
a
regulatory
order
and
therein
lies
the
problem
because
the
louisiana
statute
attempts
to
infringe
upon
the
area
reserved
exclusively
for
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
that
is
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
yes,
under
the
--
right
sir.
we
are
here
seeking
to
intervene
as
parties
to
assert
our
own
interest
as
the
taxpayers
directly
affect
it
and
to
support
the
plaintiff
states
in
attacking
the
tax
on
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
the
special
master
has
recommended
our
intervention
because
we
satisfy
all
the
traditional
requirements
for
intervention
as
exemplified
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
applicable
case
law.
louisiana
has
raised,
in
that
connection,
a
specter
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
we
submit
and
as
the
master
implied
in
his
report,
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
really
apply
here
because
we
are
not
suing
the
sovereign
state
of
louisiana.
we
are,
however,
seeking
to
intervene
in
a
case
properly
brought
by
other
sovereign
states.
moreover,
the
whole
purpose
underlying
the
eleventh
amendment
is
to
protect
the
states
from
attacks
on
its
treasury.
this
is
not
that
because
the
relief
sought
here
is
prospective
only
against
the
imposition
of
what
is
deemed
to
be
an
unconstitutional
levy.
moreover,
and
perhaps
foremost,
louisiana
has
waived
any
eleventh
amendment
immunity
because
it
has
authorized
any
person
contesting
this
tax
or
any
state
tax
to
come
into
its
courts,
in
any
federal
court,
any
federal
or
state
court
and
make
its
case
known.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
yes,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
oh
but
it
is
--
it
is
just
that,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
and
for
this
reason
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
processing
--
there's
not
a
tax
on
processing.
it's
a
tax
on
the
so-called
first
use
of
the
gas
that
is
coming
into
louisiana.
now
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well,
one
of
the
uses
happens
to
be
processing.
there
are
many
others.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
but
the
--
but
the
effect
--
yes
it
is,
sir.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
because,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
processing,
first
of
all,
it
is
an
integral
part
of
the
interstate
transmission
of
this
gas
which
began
offshore
at
the
wellhead.
now,
processing
is
so
interconnected
or
so
integral
with
the
interstate
transmission
of
that
gas
that
it's
necessarily
a
part
of
that
interstate
transmission
process
and
it
doesn't
interrupt,
the
uninterrupted
stream
of
that
gas
as
it
comes
into
louisiana
in
its
transport
and
beyond.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
all
right
sir,
well
what
is
your
--
is
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
but
in
any
activity
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well,
the
process
--
i
may
say
this,
your
honor.
the
processing
is
traditionally
done
by
the
producers
who
own
the
liquids
and
liquefiables
and
they
want
to
get
those
liquids
and
liquefiables
out
of
the
gas.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
so
they
attempt
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
but
the
tax
is
not
imposed
on
it.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
they
do
it
in
louisiana,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
in
plants,
yes,
tremendous
plants
which
do
that.
but
this
tax
is
not
imposed
on
the
processing,
it's
imposed
on
the
natural
gas
and
coming
into
that
plant
is
the
natural
gas
that
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
yes.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
one
of
the
uses
is
processing,
sir,
but
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well,
it
may
be
semantics,
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
have
a
battle
of
semantics
here.
this
is
--
this
is
so
core,
the
first-use
tax
on
natural
gas,
but
it
really
it
is
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
i
--
i
don't
know
that
a
state
could
not
do
that,
to
put
a
tax
on
the
processing
of
gas,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
within
the
confines
of
louisiana
and
if
that
was
a
tax
on
processing
itself,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
yes,
it
is.
processing
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
but
you're
talking
about
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
but
this
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
the
effect
of
--
the
effect
of
this
tax
is
that
it's
transported
beyond
to
louisiana's
borders,
sir,
because
the
only
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well
i
think
--
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that,
justice
white,
is
that
the
court
would
have
to
--
would
have
to
hold
that
the
interstate
commerce
does
not
begin
until
the
processing
has
been
completed.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
interstate
commerce
pays
its
way,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
to
--
that
it
must
be
--
well,
let
me
get
off
that.
it
is
levied
only
as
to
ocs
gas,
this
particular
tax.
and
even
though
it
is
processed,
it
is
still
that
natural
gas
that
comes
through
that
plant.
in
practical
effect,
it
falls
only
on
the
pipeline
companies
who
transport
the
gas
through
and
beyond
louisiana.
mr.
frank
j.
peragine
well,
because
it
passes
on
the
--
the
pipelines
pass
it
on
and
ultimately,
it
falls
on
the
customers
of
the
pipeline
companies.
my
time
is
up,
your
honors.
excuse
me.
