mr.
smith,
you
say
that
these
other
courts
are
“inappropriate.”
don't
you
need
a
better
word
than
inappropriate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
it
wouldn't
be
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
an
awful
problem
with
saying
that
money
is
not
an
interest
on
the
sovereign.
i
mean,
the
sovereign
cannot
operate
them
well
without
money,
can
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
part
and
when
they
use
that
money
for
gas,
they
can't
use
that
same
money
for
police
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
fire
or
any
other.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
state
is
involved.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state's
money
is
involved,
the
state's
life,
blood
is
involved.
it
is
all
a
lot
of
beautiful
phrases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you've
been
passed
on
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
was
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it's
still
tied
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
they're
still
tied
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
i'm
going
to
ask
you
next,
when
is
it
set
for
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
is
it
set
for
trial
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
is
the
state
case
set
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
isn't
set.
neither
one
is
set.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
over
two
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
think
that
could've
been
the
reason
for
the
original
jurisdiction
provision
in
the
constitution
that
the
state
did
not
go
down
to
a
local
state
court
of
another
state?
don't
you
think
that
might
have
been
the
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
pugh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
all
(inaudible)
they've
taken
over
two
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
should
you
make
maryland
pay
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
louisiana
court
can
interpret
that
federal
statute
better
than
we
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no?
