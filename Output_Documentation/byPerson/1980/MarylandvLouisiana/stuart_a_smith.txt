mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
can
be
stated
with
assurance
on
an
examination
of
the
special
master's
report
and
on
the
statute
that
this
louisiana
first-use
tax
on
natural
gas
is
aimed
at
what
is
called
ocs
gas
or
outer
continental
shelf
gas.
it
essentially
exempts
all
gas
for
which
a
severance
tax
is
paid
either
in
any
other
state
or
in
louisiana.
it
also
was
aimed
in
part
on
federal
enclave
gas.
that
is
the
gas
that
is
extracted
from
federal
enclaves
owned
by
the
federal
government.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
has,
as
the
court
has
said
in
numerous
opinions
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
sale
and
ratemaking
over
the
sale
of
transportation
of
gas
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
gas
is
moving
interstate
commerce
from
the
wellhead
to
the
burner
tips,
the
cases
or
legion
that
that
movement
is
interstate
commerce.
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
objects
principally
to
section
47:1303c
which
is
set
forth
in
full
at
page
6
of
our
brief.
that
is
the
last
brief
we
filed
just
exception
of
the
united
states.
and
that
provision
states
any
agreement
or
contract
by
which
an
owner
of
natural
gas
at
a
time
made
taxable
use
first
occurs
claims
a
right
to
reimbursement
or
refund
the
such
taxes
from
any
other
party
in
interest
other
than
a
purchaser
of
such
natural
gas
is
hereby
declared
to
be
against
public
policy
and
unenforceable
to
that
extent.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
accept
both
of
them
and
in
fact,
the
louisiana
statute,
section
4
(2)
of
the
statute,
the
louisiana
legislature
thought
that
this
1303c
was
so
important
and
such
a
core
provision
to
the
tax
that
it
says
--
states
that
if
that
tax
--
if
that
provision
is
held
unconstitutional,
the
entire
statute
falls.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
court
accepts
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
and
if
the
court
accepts
that
argument,
the
entire
statute
falls
and
the
court
need
not
reach
any
other
argument.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
--
ferc
would've
have
had
no
difficulty
suing
louisiana
and
in
fact,
there
is
a
suit
that
has
brought
in
the
middle
district
of
louisiana,
but
that
the
states
cannot
be
parties
to
that
suit
as
general
sachs
has
pointed
out.
so,
the
prudential
considerations
indicate
that
the
states
cannot
be
heard
in
that
suit.
secondly,
that
suit
--
the
district
court
in
that
suit,
has
abstained
from
deciding
the
matter
and
indefinitely
postponed
it
pending
a
resolution
of
the
--
of
suits
brought
by
louisiana
officials
in
the
louisiana
courts,
and
the
louisiana
court
has
indefinitely
postponed
consideration
of
its
suit
which
the
states
cannot
be
parties
as
well
pending
a
resolution
--
you
know,
disposition
by
this
court
of
the
matter.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
does.
i
think
that
--
the
point
simply
is,
is
that
those
--
both
of
those
forms
are
inappropriate
forms
for
the
resolution
of
what
we
think
are
these
major
constitutional
questions
because
number
one,
the
states
cannot
be
heard
in
those
suits.
secondly,
in
fact
louisiana,
in
the
state
action,
recently,
sought
to
move
things
along
or
to
give
the
appearance
of
moving
things
along
by
seeking
a
rule
to
have
the
states
“invited
into
the
suit,”
and
that
state
court
refused.
so
the
matter
--
you
know,
those
--
those
suits
are
off
track
and
theyre
not
--
they're
really
not
going
anywhere.
the
only
--
the
only
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
what
--
the
reason
theyre
off
track
--
well
this
--
let
me
point
one
of
the
thing
with
respect
to
the
state
suits
which
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
amicus
in
support
of
the
complaint
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
in
this
court
and
that
is
that
the
--
that
state
suit
is
a
declaratory
action
by
state
--
by
state
officials
against
the
pipelines
and
producers
and
more
or
less
asks
the
court
to
hold
the
tax
valid
in
anticipation
of
possible
challenges
of
invalidity.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
probably
not
an
article
iii
case
of
controversy
since
it
asks
that
louisiana
court
for
a
judge
for
an
advisory
opinion
about
--
about
a
tax
in
anticipation
of
the
challenge
that
you
know
in
another
court
that
hasn't
occurred
yet.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
really
--
i
suspect
that
they're
really
not
capable
of
the
kind
of
constitutional
resolution
of
the
sort.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
and
i
think
that
the
prudential
considerations
that
dictated
the
court
deferring
or
dismissing
the
motion
or
denying
the
motion
for
a
bill
--
for
leave
to
file
a
complaint
in
arizona
versus
new
mexico,
simply
don't
apply
there
--
apply
here
because
there
--
there,
the
new
mexico
suits
were
capable
of
the
kind
of
resolution.
in
fact,
the
special
master
in
his
report
of
may
14
in
this
case
pointed
out
that
the
--
one
of
the
utility
companies
in
the
new
--
arizona
versus
new
mexico
case
was
in
privity
with
arizona
because
it
was
a
political
subdivision
of
arizona.
so
essentially,
the
state
could
be
heard
in
the
new
mexico
court.
and
here
--
here,
the
sovereign
states
cannot
be
heard
and
that
seems
to
be
plain
and
i
don't
think
that
anybody
really
could
take
serious
dispute
of
that.
that's
why
we
think
that
the
prudential
considerations
really
speak
in
favor
of
the
court's
original
--
employment
of
the
original
jurisdiction
in
this
context
because
of
the
fact
that
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
declined
are
really
distinguishable.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
that
makes
a
big
difference.
essentially,
the
court
said
in
its
per
curiam
opinion
that
the
solar
power
company
was
a
political
subdivision
of
arizona.
that
means
essentially
that
the
state
of
arizona
had
a
--
had
a
mechanism
by
which
it
could
be
heard
in
the
new
mexico
courts
in
the
states
of
maryland
and
the
eight
other
states
involved
in
this
case
really
don't
have
that
--
don't
have
that
opportunity.
the
--
the
jurisdictional
provision
of
1251
(a)
(1)
is
really
an
exclusive
one
and
for
the
state
of
maryland
to
complain
here
in
its
capacity
as
consumer
and
as
parens
patriae,
the
original
jurisdiction
is
the
voice
for
that
very
purpose
of
giving
the
states
an
absolutely
objective
forum
for
the
resolution
of
what
our
very
complicated
and
touchy
constitutional
questions
that
really
go
to
the
heart
of
the
really
federal
system,
i
think.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
i
would
say
the
same
thing
but
of
course,
i
don't
have
to
say
that
here
because
it's
much
--
we
have
a
much
--
the
state
of
maryland
has
a
much
stronger
case
because
it
is
a
consumer
of
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
of
natural
gas
in
the
same
way
that
the
federal
government
did.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
the
parens
patriae
thing
is
compelling
in
the
sense
that
you
know,
you've
got
a
bunch
of
consumers,
you
know,
who
basically
on
the
basis
of
this
tax
which
is
really
--
you
know,
for
want
of
a
better
expression,
exported,
you
know
fiscal
greed
or
going
to
have
to
pay
higher
utility
bills
and
the
chances
of
people
like
that
bringing
a
suit
to
complain
in
the
proper
forum
are
really
remote.
and
for
the
state
to
act
as
parens
patriae
in
that
kind
of
capacity,
it
seems
to
me
is
in
the
best
traditions
of
parens
patriae
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that's
so,
but
you
know
here,
where
the
fiscal
stakes
are
so
large,
where
maryland
also
is
suing
in
its
capacity
of
consumer,
i
don't
think
that
you
know
the
court
need
to
wrestle
with
those
difficult
questions
of
what
would
happen
if
the
state
was
only
here
as
parens
patriae.
i
think
i
would
like
to
talk
in
my
remaining
time
about
the
complaint
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
here
and
that
is
essentially
section
1303
(c).
the
language
i
read
essentially
prohibits
a
pass
back
of
the
tax
to
the
producer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
correct
and
i
think
that's
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
dispute
about
that.
now,
what
that
means
essentially,
by
prohibiting
the
pass
back,
louisiana
has
responded
to
the
only
other
sort
of
concern
here
that
the
producers
would
complain
about
this
tax.
and
what
they
did
essentially
was
the
same
thing
that
texas
did
in
the
michigan-wisconsin
case
which
the
court
struck
down,
that
texas
gallery
taxes
as
violative
of
the
commerce
clause.
louisiana
wanted
to
protect
the
producers
which
own
the
residual
liquid
and
liquefiable
hydrocarbons.
and
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
over
last
25
years
that
a
cost
of
processing
and
transportation,
the
very
kind
of
taxable
use
that
louisiana
sets
out
in
its
statute
that
that
cost
is
a
cost
to
be
borne
by
the
producers
because
it
is
essentially
a
cost
of
extracting
the
liquid
hydrocarbons
that
the
--
that
the
producer
retains
or
gets
back
when
the
gas
is
processed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right,
but
the
rest
of
them,
you
know,
get
it
back
i
think.
essentially
the
mechanism
as
--
the
mechanics
of
the
processes
the
special
master
set
forth
in
his
findings
are
based
on
louisiana's
profits.
so
there's
no
quarrel
about
that.
mechanism
is
essentially
that
the
producers
retain
or
get
back,
the
liquid
and
liquefiable
hydrocarbons.
and
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
that
that
is
--
that
the
costs
associated
with
that
process
are
to
be
borne
by
the
producers
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
because
the
producer,
in
effect,
--
in
all
cases,
retains
the
liquid
and
liquefiable
hydrocarbons.
now,
the
commission
has
taken
the
position
and
the
commission
has
sole
and
exclusive
authority
to
allocate
cost.
the
natural
gas
act
is
clear
on
that.
that
that
is,
of
course,
to
be
borne
by
the
producers.
but
the
louisiana
statute
says
no,
that
any
allocation
that
requires
that
pass
back
is
to
be
abrogated
and
cant
be
enforced.
now,
that
sets
the
commission
and
louisiana
on
a
collision
course
that
we
claim
violates
the
commerce
clause.
and
in
that
--
in
support
of
that,
we
need
look
no
further
than
the
court's
opinion
in
northern
natural
gas
versus
kansas
commission
where
this
kansas
commission
tried
very
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
and
in
fact,
it
was
really
arguably
even
more
benign,
because
what
the
kansas
commission
tried
to
do
was
to
impose
a
ratable
taking
over
a
number
of
wells.
and
the
courts
--
and
the
court
said,
“no
you
cannot
invade
that
--
that
is
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.”
now
to
that,
louisiana
says
or
the
special
master
says,
“well,
let's
see.
let's
take
some
evidence
and
see
whether
in
fact
--
as
to
the
degree
of
conflict
that
there
really
is
between
the
commission
and
the
louisiana
statute.”
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
plaintiff
states.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
intervened.
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
motion
pending
to
intervene
as
plaintiff
which
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
which
the
master
will
--
will
support.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
strictly
on
the
pleadings.
strictly
on
the
pleadings
other
than
the
basis
of
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
essentially
it's
a
motion
for
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
right.
well,
the
evidence
outside
--
the
evidence
outside
the
pleadings
is
the
evidence
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
doesn't
have
to
any
evidence.
i
mean
the
nature
of
the
--
you
know,
the
decisions
are
there.
the
statute
is
there
and
what
the
special
master
said
was,
“let's
take
some
evidence
to
see
what
the
degree
of
conflict
really
is.
perhaps
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
can
accommodate
itself
to
louisiana.”
we
submit
that
that's
got
it
back.
that
stands
a
supremacy
clause
on
its
head.
it's
not
the
commission
that
has
to
accommodate
itself
to
louisiana.
it's
louisiana
that
has
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
commission
because
of
the
commission's
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
the
commission
put
out
an
order
allocating
these
costs,
well,
it's
for
the
--
well,
let
me
say
and
my
time
is
--
i
don't
want
to
trench
upon
the
time
of
the
pipelines
but
let
me
simply
say
that
the
commission
--
it
is
not
necessary
to
consider
what
would
happen
if
the
commission
put
out
an
order
because
in
our
view,
the
mere
fact
that
louisiana
has
trenched
upon
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
the
commission
could
agree
with
louisiana,
but
that's
not
the
point.
louisiana
cannot
speak
to
the
allocation
of
cost
because
that
function
is
a
judgment
for
the
commission
to
make
and
the
commission
to
make
alone.
and
to
that
extent,
let
me
close
by
simply
referring
to
the
court
the
language
in
page
--
the
language
in
northern
natural
gas
that
we
think
answers
this
contention
decisively.
the
court
said,
“it
may
be
true
as
the
state
commissioner
urges
that
accommodation
on
the
part
of
the
federal
power
commission
could
avoid
direct
collision.”
but
this
argument
misses
the
point,
not
the
federal,
but
the
state
regulation
must
be
subordinated
when
congress
has
so
plainly
occupied
the
regulatory
field.
thank
you
