general
sachs,
let
me
ask
you
this.
once
this
case
was
filed
here,
papers
were
filed
here,
is
there
anything
unusual
about
having
the
state
courts
and
any
other
federal
court
to
defer
action
until
they
knew
where
this
case
was
going,
if
anywhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
any
event,
they
might
like
to
know
what
we
think
about
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
resume
at
one
o'clock
with
albernas
against
the
united
states.
