justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
sachs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
the
so-called
merits
of
the
case,
is
it
your
opinion
that
illinois
--
illinois
versus
milwaukee
completely
overruled
ohio
versus
wyandotte?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maryland
is
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
disagree
with
the
notion
that
there
is
some
tension
between
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia
and
ohio
versus
wyandotte?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
ordinarily
a
litigant
suing
on
the
basis
that
the
tax
violated
the
commerce
clause
or
for
some
other
reason
was
deficient
constitutionally
would
have
this
case
reviewed
in
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals.
and
if
it
is
as
important
as
you
say
it
is
in
this
court
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
or
perhaps
one
of
few
remaining
direct
appeals.
here,
you
have
a
special
master
and
it
goes
directly
to
this
court.
given
the
importance
of
the
case,
i
would
think
the
prudential
considerations
mentioned
in
wyandotte
might
be
all
--
all
the
more
important
in
that
you
would
get
more
exhaustive
review
of
your
contentions
in
the
ordinary
litigated
process
than
you
would
in
the
original
jurisdiction
type
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
mean
exhaustions
in
the
sense
of
exhaustion
of
remedies,
but
i
mean
review
by
several
different
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
philadelphia
against
new
jersey,
of
course,
came
up
through
the
regular
courts,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
but
that
--
that's
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
maryland
itself
have
gone
into
united
states
district
court
in
louisiana
and
made
this
same
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
supports
you
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
ferc
would've
had
no
difficulty
in
suing
louisiana
in
the
federal
district
court
in
louisiana,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
so
that
all
revolves
around
our
original
jurisdiction
in
here,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
part
of
the
reason
theyre
off
track
is
because
of
this
original
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
solar
power
district
in
arizona
is
in
privity
with
the
suit
of
arizona
only
in
the
sense
that
it
--
there's
an
enabling
statute
alive
to
be
formed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
--
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
the
state
of
maryland
itself
was
not
a
direct
purchaser
of
louisiana
gas?
in
other
words,
if
it's
simply
suing
parens
patriae?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
granted
--
granted
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
granted
but
i
was
asking
you
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where's
the
limitation
then?
isn't
the
state
capable
of
acting
as
parens
patriae
in
almost
any
suit
that
any
of
its
citizens
are
affected
by?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
peragine,
you
--
you've
actually
commenced
a
refund
suit
have
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
you
lost
in
louisiana
court
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
this
court
would
be
open
on
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
semantics
in
the
same
sense
that
general
sachs
referred
to
justice
cardoza's
opinion
in
silas
mason
against
henneford?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
the
states
have
any
standing
to
object
to
it
if
in
private
or
if
that
involves
only
a
pipeline?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
it
take
approximately
20
years
for
the
state
of
arizona
--
for
the
case
of
arizona
versus
california
to
be
finally
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
decided
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gressman,
is
there
any
hint
in
the
constitution,
article
iii
or
in
our
previous
cases
that
there
is
some
bifurcation
in
our
original
jurisdiction
between
cases
that
can
be
decided
on
the
pleadings
and
cases
that
require
evidentiary
hearings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would've
thought
after
maine
against
(inaudible),
maryland
certainly
could
litigate
in
the
louisiana
courts
about
the
constitutionality
of
louisiana.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sachs,
supposing
that
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
became
convinced
that
a
number
of
maryland
residents
who
would
move
or
retire
to
louisiana
were
being
unconstitutionally
taxed
by
louisiana
in
the
--
in
a
state
tax
proceeding.
could
it
bring
an
original
action
against
louisiana
as
parens
patriae
in
this
course
claiming
that
the
louisiana
statute
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
count
heads
to
decide
whether
you're
parens
patriae
or
anything?
