mr.
robert
g.
pugh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
absolutely,
it
refused
him
to
this
extent
if
i
may,
your
honor.
we
moved
that
they
be
invited
because
it
was
a
--
we
thought
it
was
important
a
forum
to
be
there.
and
that
connection
and
admittedly
our
statutes
do
not
have
a
procedural
method
by
which
an
invitation
may
be
extended
from
a
court.
however,
we
wanted
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
pipelines
had
some
objection
to
their
presence
in
that
litigation.
we
found
the
answer
to
that
in
that
they
raised
all
of
the
questions
concerning
whether
or
not
there
could
be
an
invitation
under
the
laws
of
louisiana
to
someone
to
join
in
one
of
the
proceedings.
the
court
said
that
it
would
welcome
them
but
the
court
did
acknowledge
that
we
had
no
procedural
vehicle
to
specifically
invite
them
in.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
your
honor,
we
have
an
ongoing
proceed.
it
has
not
been
indefinitely
postponed.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
we
are
absolutely
bind
--
well,
whether
or
not
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--
whether
or
not
this
is
a
prestigious
vehicle
to
accept
an
invitation
issued
by
an
attorney
general
to
another
state.
i
will
state,
your
honor,
that
we
will
not
oppose
their
argument.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
our
courts
will
not
oppose
the
intervention
because
the
court
has
already
said
it
would
welcome
them
upon
their
request,
and
that's
in
the
record
in
louisiana.
and
let's
speak
of
those
actions
if
i
may.
first
of
all,
immediately
after
the
act
was
passed,
it
was
louisiana
that
filed
a
suit.
it
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding,
not
only
against
the
pipelines,
but
also
the
other
parties
in
interest,
the
producers.
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
factual
aspects
of
this
case
is
these
so-called
“contracts”
which
is
supposed
to
trigger
everything.
they
haven't
surfaced.
we
don't
know
who
wrote
what
to
whom
and
under
what
circumstance.
to
that
extent,
we
made
the
producers
as
well
as
the
pipelines,
parties
defendants
in
our
proceedings.
within
a
week,
before
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
and
our
suit
was
removed.
the
federal
court,
on
a
motion
to
remand,
remanded
our
suit
and
at
the
same
time,
on
a
motion
to
stay
or
dismiss,
stayed
the
federal
suit.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that
was
september
the
29th,
that
litigation
was
filed.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
1978
and
it
was
tied
up
for
full
5
months
based
on
the
removal.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
they
appealed
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
so,
the
federal
court
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
is
--
it
was
set
for
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
the
federal
case
is
not
set
for
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
we
are
prepared
to
set
the
state
case
immediately.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
neither
of
those
proceedings
have
been
set
for
trial
but
if
i
may
follow
it
through,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
sir.
we
first
filed
the
suit
on
september
of
1978.
now,
when
this
suit
was
filed,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
they
would
waive
the
argument,
said
they
would
wait
to
see
what
this
court
did.
to
that
extent,
they
didn't
stay
up
but
they
put
it
if
you
will
on
the
backburner.
now,
what
we
have
done
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
your
honor,
is
we
have
moved
to
consolidate
and
the
pipelines
say
that
they
don't
object
to
the
consolidation
of
the
state
court's
suit
that
we
filed
and
their
refund
suit
that
they
filed,
so
that
all
of
the
parties,
that
is
to
say
both
the
pipelines
and
the
producers
are
--
will
be
before
the
court
at
one
time.
it
is
to
that
proceeding
that
we
believe
that
the
plaintiff
states,
if
they
wish
to
do
so
may
join
us
and
we
welcome
them.
at
that
point,
we
may
have
complete
state
court
adjudication
about
a
most
difficult
statute.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i'm
satisfied
that
was
the
reason,
your
honor,
but
--
but
the
problem
here
is,
should
there
not
be
a
state
court
interpretation
of
its
own
acts.
this
court
has
certainly
indicated
so
in
the
past.
this
court,
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
in
the
kennedy
case,
in
virginia
versus
--
west
virginia
and
the
pullman
case,
and
a
case
resolving
the
very
same
question
here,
in
the
great
lakes
case.
this
court
and
the
great
lakes
case
said
that
the
refund
procedure
in
louisiana
is
a
speedy
adequate
remedy,
approved
its
use,
stayed
its
hand
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
but
it
may
be,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
may
--
louisiana
has
a
broad
jurisdictional
base.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
they'd
intervene,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes
sir.
the
only
place
that
everybody
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
of
course,
it
--
we
suggest
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
they're
going
to
go
in
and
they're
going
to
move
to
intervene
and
we're
going
to
say,
“we
love
to
have
you
and
at
that
time,
we're
going
to
have
all
the
parties
in
louisiana
and
louisiana
is
the
one
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
because
they
couldn't
bring
the
action
in
louisiana
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
but
it
doesn't
mean
they
could
intervene
on
a
pendent
action.
that's
the
differential
between
the
two
if
they
couldn't
bring
the
action
in
the
state
court.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
it's
my
appreciation
that
they
could
not,
could
be
on
their
own,
but
it's
my
procedural
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
in
our
initial
suit?
on
our
declaratory
judgment
act,
we
can
make
any
party
who
was
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
suit,
a
defendant.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
could
have,
if
you
will
drag
the
united
states
of
america
into
a
state
court
proceeding
of
this
nature.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
it
is
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
if
you're
talking
about
the
full
--
ferc.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
ferc
actually
has
the
same
issue
up
right
now.
ferc
is
deciding
whether
or
not
--
see,
they
passed
the
tax
through.
they
apparently
felt
that
they
had
the
jurisdiction
to
pass
the
tax
through
and
they
did
it.
right
now,
ferc
is
deciding
whether
or
not
they
ought
to
change
their
mind
about
that
and
whether
or
not
the
producers
ought
to
pay
some
or
all
of
that
tax.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
right
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
could
be
these
problems
but
one
thing
that
hasn't
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
for
the
raised
reasons,
it
would,
your
honor.
is
that
that
self-destruct
provision
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--
relates
to
processing
and
also
to
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
all
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
would
not
be
--
self-destruct
until
these
contracts
were
presented
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
find
out
whether
or
not
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
either
by
courts
or
attacks
that
that
would
be
passed
back.
now,
ferc
can
do
what
it
wishes.
we
have
no
control
of
it.
they
may
pass
that
tax
on
or
follow
it
and
we
can't
help
it.
if
they
pass
it
back
and
it
affects
our
act,
then
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it
becomes
operative
if
there
is
a
judicial
determination
that
either
a
cost
or
a
tax,
there
are
two
paragraphs,
are
determined
by
a
court,
a
final
court.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
all
right,
that
processing
and
also
distribution
--
no
sir,
i'm
sorry.
it's
processing
and
separation
are
affected
by
that
court
decision
but
they
are
the
users,
your
honor,
the
other
users,
there
is
the
transfer
of
the
gas
itself
to
the
end
of
the
pipeline
--
of
the
processing
plant.
that's
another
use
that's
not
covered
under
these
two.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
the
difficulty
that
all
of
these
cases
it
had
with
defining
as
you
will
know,
not
only
what
process
means,
what
does
distribution
mean,
what
does
gathering
mean
because
those
three
items
were
exempt
from
the
statute.
in
fact,
the
natural
gas
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--
policy
act
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
are
three
constitutional
provisions,
none
the
least
of
which
is
74b
of
our
constitution
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
--
brand
new
constitution.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
under
the
taxing
statute?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
is
that
what?
let
me
--
let
me
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
they
claimed
they
don't
owe
it.
they
don't
claim
--
it's
not
--
they
say
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
pay
it
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
under
state
law
as
well
as
federal
law.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
absolutely.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it's
based
upon
the
validity
of
the
tax.
it's
the
tax
refund.
it's
a
--
but
what's
important
is
one
of
the
issues
that
are
raised
in
the
state
court
below
that
can
only
be
resolved
in
a
state
court
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it's
really
what
they're
claiming.
they're
claiming
it's
a
tax
on
natural
gas
and
we
have
a
provision
in
our
constitution
that
says
you
cannot
tax
natural
gas
except
as
it
relates
to
a
service
tax,
severance
tax.
now,
the
validity
of
that
must
be
determined
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
law
applies.
the
constitution
of
louisiana
may
well
resolve
this
problem
for
you
and
you
never
have
to
reach
it.
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
important.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
what
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
i
appreciate
you're
giving
me
those
conservatory
words
because
we
don't
confess
anything.
however,
we'd
be
pleased
for
them
to
prove
it
and
attempt
to
prove
it,
and
they've
alleged
it.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
how
does
it
taken
over
two
years?
i
could
get
--
tell
you
one
reason,
your
honor,
because
every
other
week
i
get
another
pleading
in
this
case.
i
had
the
difficulty
of
keeping
up
and
there
are
lots
of
lawyers
in
louisiana,
but
it's
trying
to
juggling
both.
you
go
--
we'd
file
a
suit,
they
remove
it.
the
court
remands
it,
they
appeal
the
other
suit,
the
next
thing
we
know
we
got
this
suit
and
every
other
--
two
pleadings
had
been
filed
since
our
last
report
in
this
case.
so,
we're
busy,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
and
i
commit
to
the
court.
you
send
it
back
to
louisiana
and
we're
going
to
be
in
court.
now,
we're
through
with
of
this.
we're
going
to
resolve
this
issue
like
we
tried
to
immediately
after
the
act
was
passed.
we
tried
to
do
it
and
we
got
stopped
everywhere
we
went.
we
are
concern
about
the
money,
we
need
it.
you
raised
the
question
and
thank
you
for
doing
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
you
raised
the
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
in
the
state
court,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
it's
not
my
appreciation
that
they
cannot.
it's
my
appreciation
that
maryland,
if
it
chooses
to
do
so
under
our
procedure
may
intervene
in
that
litigation,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
commit
to
the
court
that
as
a
matter
of
louisiana
law,
they
can.
of
course,
i'm
not
a
maine
lawyer.
i
do
understand
their
decision,
under
the
words
of
that
decision,
they
could
go
elect
on
our
procedural
statute,
they'd
do
the
same
thing
and
we'd
welcome
to
do
it.
your
honor,
you
mentioned
--
you
mentioned
money,
the
phrase
i
think
the
court
used
was
government
can't
act
without
money.
we
have
that
same
problem,
your
honor.
we
can't
act
without
it
--
do
you
know
that
39
square
miles
of
louisiana
goes
in
the
water
every
year,
it's
gone.
when
we
lose
39,
federal
control
ocs
picks
up
39.
we
are
losing
land
and
what
are
we
losing
it
by
because
there
are
124
of
these
processing
plants.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
we
don't
want
to
make
maryland
specifically
pay
for
it.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
this,
yes,
is
what's
tearing
up
the
coastline.
the
bringing
of
this
case
with
6000
miles
of
pipe
we
have
crisscrossed
from
one
end
to
the
other.
assuming
it's
12
miles
out,
that
would
be
500
different
pipes
coming
in
there.
everytime
those
pipes
come
in
there,
they're
destroying
our
entire
coastline
and
we're
doing
what
we
can
to
furnish
gas
for
this
country
but
we
--
but
we
need
some
help.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
at
this
point
and
i'll
answer
your
question
is
that
--
you're
talking
about
legislative
history,
we
don't
have
any
legislative
here.
what
happened
if
some
girl
pushed
a
button
down
there
and
then
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
yes
sir,
absolutely
all
right
to
ask
me.
we
--
we
have
in
louisiana,
unfortunately,
we
have
a
situation
where
we've
got
an
act
here
that
is
the
subject
as
many
acts
of
competing
interest.
in
louisiana,
about
the
only
thing
we've
had
for
years
is
oil
and
gas
industry
and
they
are
powerful.
they
have
been
powerful.
how
else
could
the
provision
be
on
the
constitution
that
you
couldn't
tax
the
natural
gas
except
for
a
service
tax.
we've
got
an
act
that
has
been
the
--
the
wagon
has
been
loaded
on
it.
we
only
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
need
an
opportunity
to
interpret
our
own
acts.
the
producers
are
strong
enough
to
put
that
provision
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
in
all
candor,
your
honor,
i
kind
of
got
lost
in
my
own
verbatim.
as
i
understand
the
court's
question,
try
me
out,
let
me
see,
as
i
understood
your
question.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
what
we're
saying
is
if
there's
a
contract
to
pass
back
those
provisions
of
it,
then
it
self-destruct.
it's
in,
your
honor,
because
it
was
lobbied
in
there.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
they're
powerful
enough
to
do
so
and
they
have
done
so.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
no,
sir.
it
--
it
depends
on
whether
ferc
tells
them
to
pay
it,
your
honor.
if
ferc
tells
them
to
pay
it,
then
they
pay
it.
we
don't
make
ferc
do
that.
now,
if
ferc
wants
to
say
to
maryland,
we
were
wrong
in
that
10a
or
10b,
we
want
it
now
to
be
against
the
producers,
then
we
got
us
a
(inaudinle),
your
honor.
and
we're
going
to
have
it
in
louisiana
and
it's
going
to
be
between
the
producers
and
the
pipelines
and
maybe
that's
what
we
ought
to
really
be
doing
anyway,
is
let
that
be
aired
as
between
those
two
parties
because
they
are
--
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
your
honor,
they
got
to
be
taxes
that
can
be
passed
on
because
the
act
says
they
can
be
passed
on.
the
act
says
they
can
consider
cost
and
that
taxation
is
part
of
that
court.
there's
an
ad
valorem
tax
that's
being
passed
on.
there
are
sales
tax
presumably
being
passed
on.
there's
an
apportionment
tax
from
louisiana
all
the
way
up
to
maryland.
every
state
is
collecting
the
tax
on
those
pipelines
going
through
there
and
ferc
is
letting
it
all
be
done.
so,
the
question
is
why
can't
we
have
a
tax
and
let
ferc
if
they
want
to
pass
it
on.
if
they
don't
want
to
pass
it
on,
then
we'll
face
up
to
what
the
statute
said.
i
only
suggest
to
the
court
again
that
we
do
have
a
forum.
we
have
a
forum
where
everybody
can
be
and
a
forum
at
which
state
law
can
be
interpreted
right
down
there
where
those
processing
plants
are,
right
where
all
of
these
activities
are
occurring.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
well,
your
honor,
the
biggest
factual
issue
in
my
opinion
is
when
really
does
ferc
get
control,
do
you
understand.
the
natural
gas
act
talks
about
natural
gas
unmixed.
now,
what
is
unmixed
except
that
it's
on
the
outlet
of
the
processing
plant?
remember
the
(inaudinle)
case.
the
reason
it
was
struck
was
because
the
tax
was
a
gathering
tax
imposed
outside
of
the
processing
plant
on
the
outlet
of
the
processing
plant
and
justice
clark,
went
to
great
lengths
to
use
to
the
word
“after,”
to
italicize
it.
he
said
it's
after
processing.
it
is
after
gathering
and
it
is
after
producing.
so,
we
got
a
real
question.
we
got
another
question,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
that's
one
of
the
major
factual
issues.
another
one
issue,
the
natural
gas
policy
act
says
that
production
includes
transportation
to
the
coast.
now,
if
the
states,
as
the
natural
gas
act
require,
have
some
control
over
production
and
over
gathering,
well,
the
statute
says
it.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
did
not
suggest
that
for
a
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
only
suggest,
your
--
i
would
not
do
that,
your
honor.
i
only
suggest
that
to
interpret
one
requires
necessarily
an
appreciation
of
another.
i
don't
think
you
just
hang
these
two
statutes
up,
your
honor,
and
say,
“this
looks
good
and
that
looks
bad”
or
“this
good
look
--
looks
good
and
that
looks
bad.”
we
must
have
an
underlying
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
facts
that
are
applicable
to
that
statute,
whether
or
not
it's
the
processing
plant,
whether
or
not
it's
transportation.
well,
it's
not
--
it's
any
one
of
these
other
uses
including
sale.
and
the
only
thing
we
ask
this
court
to
do
is
give
us
an
opportunity
to
resolve
the
problem
in
a
forum
best
suited
to
make
a
determination
of
that
statute.
if
you
do
it
elsewhere,
you
don't
have
a
final
state
court
determination
anyway.
it
could
be
knocked
out
but
we'd
still
have
the
problem.
this
--
this
is
a
brand
new
ballgame.
we
still
have
a
problem
of
whether
or
not
states,
it's
my
appreciation
that
--
that
another
one
has
been
considered
by
this
court.
in
any
event,
you
have
the
problem
about
whether
the
states
who
are
required
to
bear
the
economic
burdens
of
what's
happening
to
their
state
whether
or
not
those
economic
burdens,
we
should
get
some
help
from
somewhere
else.
this
is
not
the
first
or
the
last
statute
of
this
type
that
would
be
coming
along.
we
only
suggest
that
it's
time.
it's
time
to
take
a
good
look
at
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
said
that
the
states
and
the
federal
government
should
work
together.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i
apologize.
mr.
robert
g.
pugh
i'm
not
suggesting
--
yes,
that's
actually
correct,
your
honor.
i
wish
--
it
should
be
dismissed
here.
i
would
suggest
one
other
thing
that
the
court
ought
to
consider,
the
intervention
of
the
pipelines
because
then,
you
have
the
eleventh
amendment
problem,
but
dismiss
the
case
and
let
us
try
it.
we'll
try
it,
your
honor.
that's
a
commitment
on
the
part
of
louisiana.
we'd
get
it
going.
thank
you,
sir.
