justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this,
the
trial
court
did
or
did
not
refuse
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
that
lead?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
may
i
ask
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
is
willing
to
extend
the
invitation,
does
it
or
does
not
bind
--
that
bind
your
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
bind
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
you
won't
oppose
but
what
will
your
courts
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pugh,
what
about
the
interest
of
ferc
in
the
state
court?
it's
not
a
party
to
the
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
it
get
--
how
does
it
get
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
it
brought
its
own
action,
i
gather
in
united
states
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
still
--
that's
the
one
now
before
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean,
their
--
their
issue,
as
i
understand
the
argument,
that
they
make
a
statutory
claim
that
under
the
supremacy
clause,
your
statute
has
to
fall
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
that's
their
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
they
going
to
be
heard
in
a
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
do
you
think
they
brought
their
own
federal
court
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
by
a
provision
of
your
own
tax
law,
if
that
happened,
your
whole
--
it
would
be
appealed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
ferc
were
to
--
suppose
ferc
were
to
change
its
mind
now
and
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we'll
--
we'll
put
the
whole
thing
on
the
producer,
would
yours
--
would
your
statute
then
self-destruct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
when
does
your
self-destruct
provision
become
operative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
a
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
state
courts?
