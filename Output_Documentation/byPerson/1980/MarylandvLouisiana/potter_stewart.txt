if
we
accepted
either
your
argument
or
that
of
general
sachs,
this
louisiana
tax
would
be
invalid,
would
it
not?
justice

stewart
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
accept
both
of
them
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
your
argument
is
a
constitutional
argument
insofar
as
it
relies
on
the
supremacy
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
interrupt
you
just
for
a
moment
mr.
smith
to
ask
if
each
of
the
eight
plaintiff
states
is
itself
a
consumer
of
gas?
justice
potter
stewart
right.

and
did
they

justice
potter
stewart
did
they
ask
for
an
injunction
on
future
collections?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
this
complaint
was
filed
not
just
by
the
state
of
maryland
but
by
eight
states,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
each

each
alleged
that
it
--
itself
was
a
consumer
of
gas.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
in
joining
the
taxes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
general
sachs,
every
commodity
that
the
state
buys
is
filled
with
passed
on
taxes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
--
as
you
--
does
a
state
as
a
purchaser
of
each
of
those
commodities
acquire
standing
to
attack
the
tax?
