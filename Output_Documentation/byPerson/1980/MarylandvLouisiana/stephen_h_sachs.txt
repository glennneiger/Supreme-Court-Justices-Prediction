mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
original
action
challenges
the
validity
of
louisiana's
first-use
tax
on
natural
gas
and
its
companion
measures
that
comes
to
the
court
on
exceptions,
the
two
reports
of
the
special
master.
in
his
report
of
may
14,
1980,
the
special
master
recommended
among
other
things
that
the
court
grant
the
motions
to
intervene
of
the
united
states
of
the
seventeen
pipeline
companies
and
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
in
his
report
of
september
15,
1980,
he
recommended
denial
of
louisiana's
motion
to
dismiss
and
denial
of
the
eight
plaintiff
states'
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleading.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
operation
of
the
statutory
scheme
with
particular
emphasis
on
its
facial
and
intended
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
next,
the
solicitor
general
speak
to
the
scheme's
interference
with
the
authority
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
and
finally,
mr.
peragine,
on
behalf
of
the
pipelines
will
speak
to
their
motion
to
intervene
as
well
as
to
certain
commerce
clause
issues.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
some
30
years
ago,
in
dean
milk
company
v.
madison
recognized
that
a
state
statute
which
would
be
clearly
invalid
which
--
and
i
quote
the
court
artlessly
disclosed
and
a
valid
purpose
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
this,
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court,
is
such
a
case
and
it
falls
even
more
squarely
within
this
court's
recent
precedence
of
boston
stock
exchange
against
the
new
york
tax
commission
and
the
city
of
philadelphia
against
new
jersey.
because,
your
honors,
nothing
emerges
more
clearly
from
the
115
pages
of
legislative
history
which
you
have
before
you
and
from
the
statutory
scheme
itself,
than
the
compulsive
concern
of
louisiana
to
export
this
tax.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
yes
sir.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
our
opinion
that
illinois
against
city
of
milwaukee
overrules
ohio
against
wyandotte
nor
as
our
opinion
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court's
disposition
of
the
application
for
reasons
of
jurisdiction
in
arizona
against
new
mexico.
those
cases,
your
honor,
were
not
exclusive
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
both
the
illinois
case
and
the
ohio
case
were
cases
within
the
original
jurisdiction
but
not
controlled
--
not
controlled
by
section
1251
of
the
judiciary
act,
which
gives
this
court
exclusive
jurisdiction.
furthermore,
may
i
say,
your
honor
that
this
case
is
far
from
the
kind
of
case
that
impacts
the
common
law
notions
of
nuisance
as
involved
in
one
of
those
cases.
it's
far
from
the
kind
of
case
that
impacts
scientific
testimony
and
scientific
evidence
that
would
have
been
required
as
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think,
said
in
the
ohio
case
with
mr.
justice
douglas
perhaps
in
the
illinois
case.
this
is
a
case
which
impacts
30
states
of
this
union
and
which
test
whether
or
not
one
state
at
the
time
of
energy
crisis
can,
in
what
we
claim
to
be
flagrant
violation
of
the
original
principles
of
the
commerce
clause,
can
impose
its
will
on
other
states.
and
so,
your
honor,
for
both
jurisdictional
reasons,
as
well
as
prudential
reasons,
we
think
this
case
is
radically
different
from
both
the
ohio
case
and
the
illinois
case.
and
may
i
also
add,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
that
in
arizona
against
new
mexico,
there
is
not
the
slightest
suggestion
that
we
can
find
that
the
suggestion
of
whether
or
not
the
states
can
get
an
alternative
hearing
in
some
other
forum
is
in
any
way
overruled.
and
it's
worth
to
point
out,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
here,
we
can
go
no
place
else.
there
is
no
other
forum
where
maryland
or
her
sister
states
who
are
plaintiffs
can
be
heard
and
so
for
all
those
reasons,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
case
is
quite
properly
here.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
we
are
here
in
both
capacities
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
and
we
--
and
i
make
the
same
assertion
in
both
capacities.
we
are
here
very
much
like
pennsylvania.
it
was
here
some
50
years
ago
in
a
suit
against
west
virginia
in
which
very
similar
contentions
were
being
made
when
one
state
thereby,
by
simply
cutting
off
supply,
was
having
impact
on
the
state
and
it
citizens.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
and
the
reason
--
that
as
i
do
disagree
with
the
contention
that
there
is
tension
between
the
two
propositions
for
the
reasons
that
i
began
to
indicate
perhaps
a
moment
or
two
ago.
we
are
dealing
here,
as
this
court
did
in
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia,
with
a
case
that
probes
deep
into
the
nature
of
this
union.
i
don't
blush
to
say
that
here,
two
centuries
after
the
foundation
of
this
republic,
where
youre
facing
--
and
we're
asking
this
court
to
face,
precisely
the
questions
of
sectionalism,
precisely
the
questions
of
the
ability
of
one
state
to
profiteer
from
its
position
in
this
case
as
a
--
afford
a
supply
of
a
very
important
natural
resource.
those
concerns
your
honor,
well,
i
don't
need
to
denigrate
the
issues
of
nuisance
or
the
issues
of
pollution
or
the
issues
that
vex
the
states
of
illinois
and
ohio
in
the
two
cases
that
we've
been
discussing.
well,
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
those.
we
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor,
that
here,
we
are
dealing
about
some
--
with
something
terribly
different.
this
tax
brings
in
to
the
state
of
louisiana
300
million.
let
me
be
conservative,
250
million
a
year.
and
louisiana's
statutory
structure
would
give
us,
if
we
are
successful,
if
we
could
get
to
their
courts,
and
if
we
could
sue
in
their
courts,
they
would
give
us
6%
on
our
money.
they
are
the
kinds
of
reasons
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i
have
two
responses
of
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
first
is,
i
know
nothing
in
the
law
that
suggests
that
exhaustive
is
good.
we
don't
believe
we
need
an
exhaustive
review.
we
believe
that
just
as
this
court
found
in
boston
stock
exchange,
as
it
found
in
philadelphia
against
the
city
of
new
jersey,
this
statute
is
facially
offensive
to
the
commerce
clause
and
as
mr.
smith
would
argue
to
the
supremacy
clause.
exhaustion
is
not
needed
to
determine
those
legal
questions.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
nor
--
nor
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
do
we
believe
that
review
by
several
different
courts
is
essential
to
determine
the
claim
here.
we
are
not
another
plaintiff.
we
are
not
a
litigant
as
appears
in
most
of
the
courts
of
this
country.
we
are
sovereign
states,
and
we
are
within
the
original
jurisdiction
put
there
by
the
founders
of
this
--
of
the
constitution
for
it
to
be
heard
precisely.
because
there
was
concern
that
to
be
heard
in
the
forum
of
a
foreign
state
or
to
be
heard
elsewhere,
would
not
do
justice
between
the
parties.
and
so,
we
are
here
because
we
are
within
the
constitution
of
prescription.
we
are
here
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
because
we're
within
the
statutory
prescription
and
we
are
here,
as
far
as
i
can
argue
to
you
your
honor,
with
--
on
the
right
side
of
all
of
the
prudential
concerns,
serious
indignity
of
the
claims,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
pieces
of
language
that
come,
i
think,
from
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
for
this
court
in
the
illinois
case.
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine,
i
say,
as
an
advocate
certainly
but
i
say
as
a
lawyer,
it
is
hard
for
me
to
imagine
a
more
serious
and
a
more
dignified
claim
to
engage
the
constitutional
attention
of
this
court
than
this
claim
which
harks
back
to
the
very
primal
concerns
which
were
present
when
the
constitution
was
written.
and
so,
it
doesn't
need,
in
our
respectful
judgment
your
honor,
reviewed
by
other
courts.
it
doesn't
need
factfinding
by
any
special
masters.
what
it
needs
is
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings
that
we
have
sought
and
that
we
earnestly
pressed
on
this
court's
attention.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
it
did
your
honor
but
significantly,
it
was
decided
as
i
recall
it,
on
pleadings.
and
in
boston
stock
exchange
against
the
new
york
tax
commission,
all
the
more
significantly
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
let
me
dwell
on
boston
stock
exchange
for
a
moment
if
i
may.
the
--
that
case
is
very
much
like
this
one.
there,
like
here,
it
was
decided
on
the
pleadings.
there,
like
here,
the
legislative
history,
which
betrayed
and
which
as
mr.
justice
white
in
his
opinion
for
a
unanimous
court
suggested,
which
betrayed
a
purpose
to
protect
the
instate
commercial
interest
in
an
impermissible
way.
there,
in
boston
stock
exchange
like
here,
the
claim
was
made
that
well
theres
a
compensating
--
this
is
a
really
compensating
tax
within
the
meaning
of
henneford
or
the
meaning
of
halliburton.
but
this
court
said
that
the
statute
there
did
not
support
that
characterization.
and
so,
here,
this
statute
does
not
support
that
characterization.
this
is
not
a
compensating
tax,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
well,
it
is
the
merits
but
it's
the
merits
of
the
narrow
but
fundamental
question
as
to
whether
this
statute
facially
discriminates
and
intends
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
cant
read
the
115
pages,
that's
all
there
are,
the
115
pages
which
are
exhibit
c
to
the
last
filing
on
behalf
of
the
state.
you
can't
read
that
and
the
10
or
12
pages
of
the
statute,
without
seeing
and
realizing
that
with
the
louisiana
legislature
wanted
to
do,
and
this
is
not
hyperbole
on
my
part,
it
is
theirs.
what
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
up
for
its
frustration
for
years,
much
of
which
has
been
recorded
in
the
annals
of
this
court
and
its
ability
to
profit
from
the
rich
deposits
of
natural
gas
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
the
federal
domain.
and
in
an
effort
to
do
that,
what
they
determined
to
do
was
to
impose
a
so-called
first-use
tax
on
the
first
time
this
gas
comes
into
the
state.
that
may
have
been
bad
enough.
we
may
be
here.
we
may
have
been
here
in
any
case,
but
they
went
way
beyond
that.
they
exempted
every
conceivable
local
incidents
of
the
tax.
the
local
domestic
producers
were
exempted.
the
local
utility
users
were
exempted.
the
local
commercial
interest,
which
would
take
otherwise,
take
from
the
tax
were
exempted.
and
what
they
did
as
one
of
them
said,
“if
this
tax
is
going
to
be
passed,
it's
going
to
be
a
passed
on
tax,
no
doubt
about
it.”
and
the
history
that
you'll
see
when
you
read
the
legislative
history
was
how
that
legislature
was
going
to
confront
the
problem
of
getting
the
benefits
of
the
tax
without
having
the
local
folks
bear
the
burden.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
no,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
because
it
is
our
belief
and
we
think
the
cases
are
ample
--
illinois
against
the
city
of
milwaukee
indirectly
says
it,
“we're
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court.
we
cannot
go
into
the
courts
of
louisiana
to
sue
louisiana
or
its
official
officials
and
get
that
kind
of
relief.”
but
secondly,
and
let
--
let
me
say
all
of
this
at
once
lest
i'd
be
misunderstood.
we,
because
we
were
not
the
taxpayers,
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
we
do
not
have
standing
here
in
this
court,
but
because
we
were
not
literally
the
taxpayers
in
louisiana,
we
could
not
have
engaged
in
the
refund
proceedings
which
only
the
pipeline
companies
could
have
engaged.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
they
do
indeed
support
this.
they
came
--
they
asked
to
be
--
they
intervened
and
their
position
and
ours
are
certainly
similar
on
the
merits,
ours
and
many
commentators
who
have
reviewed
these
matters,
professor
hellerstein
among
them
have
indicated
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
this
louisiana
tax.
i'd
like
to
address
if
i
may,
what
we
think
--
the
only
thing
that
we
believe
troubled
the
special
master
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
namely
the
facial
unconstitutionality
as
far
as
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
is
concerned,
what
mr.
davis,
the
special
master
did,
was
to
say
he
almost
did
it.
you
can't
read
his
opinion
without
feeling
that
--
another
inch
or
two
and
perhaps
we
would
have
been
there,
but
he
didn't
do
it.
and
on
this
aspect
of
the
case,
he
didn't
because
he
was
concerned
that
perhaps
the
actuality
of
operation
of
the
tax
would
disclose
that
it
had
a
bona
fide
compensating
tax
kind
of
a
justification.
and
with
all
respect
to
the
special
master,
we
think
he
misconceived
two
things.
first
of
all,
the
whole
notion
of
actuality
of
operation,
the
phrase
of
course
comes
from
this
court's
opinion
in
halliburton,
but
in
no
way,
shape
or
form
can
it
be
said
to
be
a
call
to
trial.
what
actuality
of
operation
meant
there
and
what
it
meant
in
its
--
in
the
seminal
case
of
henneford,
the
cardozo
opinion
many
years
ago,
saying
that
a
sales
tax
and
a
--
and
used
tax
can
indeed
be
compensating
was
simply
that
you
look
at
the
way
these
statutes
operate.
it
was
not
a
statement
that
you
need
evidence.
there
was
not
a
statement
that
you
have
to
have
a
trial.
it
was
a
question
of
looking
at
the
entire
statutory
scheme.
it
was
not,
i
repeat,
a
call
to
trial.
indeed,
in
henneford
itself,
the
opinion
--
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
that
--
that
liberated
this
from
some
of
the
past
--
it
was
an
earlier
avoidance
of
taxation
by
some
management.
i
say,
what
cardozo
did
in
henneford
was
to
decide
a
case
with
--
there
is
no
evidence.
there
--
it
is
a
--
its
basic
--
is
a
facial
judgment
he
made
in
the
henneford
opinion
which
makes
super
clear
to
us
that
actuality
of
operation
is
not
necessarily
a
call
to
trial.
and
then
the
second
thing
that
the
special
master
we
think
misperceived
was
that
there
is
a
very,
very
significant
difference
between
the
sales
tax,
used
tax,
compensating
tax
analysis
and
the
kind
of
compensation
claimed
here.
what
is
being
claimed
here
is
compensating
in
the
sense
of
we
don't
like
the
fact
that
we
can't
tax
ocs
gas
and
we
want
to
do
better.
it's
much
like
if
in
boston
stock
exchange,
they
said
we
don't
like
the
fact
that
the
regional
stock
exchanges
are
outhustling
us
or
out
advertising
us
or
drawing
business
away
from
us.
in
that
sense,
one
can
say
that
the
new
york
statute
was
compensating.
but
as
this
court
unanimously
said,
that's
not
what
compensating
means
for
purposes
of
tax
analysis.
what
compensating
means
as
mr.
justice
cardozo
said
in
the
henneford
case,
in
the
famous
metaphor
there
is
that
the
dweller
from
within
and
the
stranger
from
afar
have
to
be
treated
evenhandedly,
evenhandedness
he
said
is
the
theme
that
has
to
run
through
the
statutes.
and
may
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
when
you
examine
this
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
you
will
see
that
it
makes
a
mockery
of
the
notion
of
evenhandedness
of
what
they
did
here.
what
they
did
is
every
step
of
the
way,
read
--
if
you
read
no
other
page,
your
honors.
read
page
82c
of
the
--
of
the
legislative
history
as
reprinted
here
in
our
--
in
our
last
filing
which
is
simply
a
summary.
it's
only
one
line
and
it's
not
the
best
quotes
but
it's
one
line
in
which
you
can
--
in
one
page
in
which
you
can
see
that
they
were
saying
we're
taking
care
of
everybody
locally
who
could
possibly
get
hurt.
and
when
one
state
does
that,
when
one
state
attempts
to
profiteer
from
its
position
for
a
rich
source
of
national
energy,
when
one
saw
--
when
one
state
does
that,
it
impacts,
we
respectfully
suggest,
the
very
concerns
that
led
the
founders
of
this
republic
to
write
the
commerce
clause
and
to
--
and
it
offends
the
very
notion
of
a
free
economy
in
an
open
economy
and
of
comity
between
the
states
that
the
commerce
clause
is
all
about.
when
you
read
that
legislative
history,
you
will
see
this
(inaudinle)
you
will
see
how
they
are
upset
about
what
montana
is
doing.
you
will
see
how
they're
upset
about
the
protections
the
easterners
get.
you
will
see
how
this
is
a
part
of
a
growing
national
sectionalism
over
how
we're
going
to
afford
energy
and
who's
going
to
pay
for
it.
and
as
i
said
before,
and
as
i
say
in
closing,
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
offense.
it
is
precisely
the
kind
of
parochialism
that
the
commerce
clause
we
respectfully
suggest
was
quick
to
the
constitution
to
prevent.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
with
your
permission
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
you're
asking
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
there
were
something
unusual
about
the
fact
of
the
fifth
circuit
as
it
did,
stayed
the
ferc
action
pending
the
outcome
of
this
decision.
i
cannot
purport
to
be
an
expert,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
does
not
strike
me
as
unusual.
this
is
case
is
here
perhaps
--
i
would
like
to
think
it
means
that
the
fifth
circuit
feels
this
case
belongs
here
but
perhaps
that
asks
--
that
asks
too
much.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i
--
i
would
certainly
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
can't
--
i
must
come
back
to
what
i
said
earlier.
it
is
the
position
of
the
states.
i
appreciate
very
much
the
hospitality
of
our
friends
from
louisiana.
we
--
we
enjoy
being
told
come
on
down.
we
--
we
are
grateful
for
that,
but
we
know
that
the
original
jurisdiction,
especially
the
exclusive
aspect
of
the
original
jurisdiction
does
not
permit
us
to
go
there.
and
secondly,
the
reason
for
the
rule
on
the
first
place
ought
not
remand
a
sovereign
state
to
the
courts
of
another
state
for
disposition
of
matters
of
this
kind
of
consequence.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
well,
i
think
probably
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
for
the
very
reason
that
this
case,
for
example,
in
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia
are
different
from
pennsylvania
against
new
jersey,
that
that
commuter
tax
situation
that
occupied
this
court
in
austin
and
new
hampshire
and
then
the
original
jurisdictional
declined
where
a
state
is
really
acting
as
the
surrogate
for
some
of
its
citizens.
and
that
--
that's
not
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
not
only
are
we
their
proprietor.
as
in
our
proprietary
matter,
we
are
there
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
state
institutions
and
all
of
the
consumers
in
the
state
of
maryland
as
well
as
our
sister
states
on
behalf
of
their
citizens
a
pervasive
--
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
i
--
i
think,
with
all
respect,
that
--
that
cheapens
the
--
it
cheapens
the
concept
but
i
think
that
pervasiveness,
if
you
call
that
counting
heads
then
so
be
it.
pervasiveness
across
the
state,
cutting
across
all
lines,
it
can
add
up
to
a
parens
patriae.
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
counting
heads
in
the
sense
that
the
aggregate
problem
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts,
but
whether
or
not
you
have
to
find
out
how
many
parts
there
are
to
make
the
sum,
i
think
you
can
make
a
difference
whether
you're
dealing
with
a
thousand
citizens
or
four
millions
citizens.
and
i
think
the
parens
--
as
the
chief
--
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
the
--
in
the
hawaii
against
standard
oil
case
a
couple
of
years
ago,
there
is
a
recognized
parens
patriae
role
for
the
states
to
play
on
behalf
of
their
--
of
their
consumers.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
if
i
could,
something
of
what
i
have
to
characterize
the
disingenuousness
of
the
argument
being
tendered
by
louisiana
and
especially
the
--
what
i
would
characterize
is
the
parade
of
prudential
horribles
that
mr.
gressman
raises
for
you.
there
is
something
ironic
for
us
to
be
told
that
we
don't
have
standing
when
it
is
us
who
bear
the
tax.
the
pipelines
pass
on
the
tax.
ferc
sits
and
says,
“okay,
you
can
pass
on
the
tax.”
louisiana
passed
the
tax
knowing
and
expecting
that
it
would
go
the
heart
of
the
states
who
were
bearing
the
tax,
yet
we
are
being
told,
“you
are
not
injured.
you
were
not
the
real
party
in
interest.
you
have
not
been
hurt.”
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
runs
counter
to
every
notion
of
the
reason
for
standing.
standing
rules
in
the
first
place
are
there
to
ensure
that
the
party
raising
the
issues
will
indeed
press
the
issues,
that
they
have
a
real
stake
in
the
matter.
this
is
the
essence
of
the
case
in
controversy
requirement.
you
may
be
rest
assured,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
indeed
they
are,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stephen
h.
sachs
no,
sir,
but
the
distinction
here
is
that
the
--
the
unconstitutional
event
in
the
first
place,
as
your
legislative
history
will
show
you,
is
that
louisiana
imposed
this
tax,
taking
advantage
of
a
mechanism,
a
conduits
to
the
pipelines,
a
ferc
mechanisms,
all
of
which
happened
exactly
as
they
forecast
it
precisely
so
that
the
tax
would
be
born
as
we
bear
it.
that,
i
respectfully
suggest,
mr.
justice
stewart,
must
distinguish
this
kind
of
a
situation
for
standing
purposes
from
the
situation
in
which
every
consumer
always
bears
as
part
of
a
cost
every
tax
as
ever
passed.
i
think
that's
true
but
this
is
radically
different
from
that.
i
would
like
to
respond
if
i
may
to
a
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
earlier
with
respect
to
whether
louisiana
could
constitutionally
tax
our
processing.
i
want
to
concede
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
that
certainly
could
happen.
if
we've
learned
anything
from
complete
auto
against
brady
and
if
we've
learned
anything
from
the
washington
stevedoring
case,
we
have
been
liberated
from
the
notions
that
there
are
some
automatic
per
se
rule
that
says
you
can't
touch
it
if
it's
in
interstate
commerce.
but
what
we
also
know
is
that
a
test
must
be
applied
and
included
in
that
test
is
whether
or
not
the
statute
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
and
whether
or
not
it
is
apportioned,
et
cetera.
and
on
this
branch
of
the
case,
we
are
saying
much
like
boston
stock
exchange,
and
much
like
pennsylvania
--
city
of
philadelphia
against
new
jersey,
it
is
possible
to
say
that
facially,
this
statute
does
those
things.
so
that
we
can
live
very
comfortably,
mr.
justice
white,
in
the
universe
that
says,
“louisiana
can
find
some
tax
that
is
not
offensive
to
interstate
commerce
and
it
can
oppose
it
on
the
thing
called
processes.”
it
doesn't
matter
--
may
i
get
back
to
what
you've
raised
earlier,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
in
this
case
and
we've
yet
to
hear
facts
suggested.
they
are
tendered
or
raised
today
or
in
all
of
the
pleadings
that
suggest
any
fact
that
makes
it
necessary
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
there
is
nothing
about
processing
whether
processing
is
or
isn't
one
thing
or
another
does
not
change
the
fact
that
what
this
statute
does
is
to
take
every
conceivable
opportunity
to
export
this
tax
out
of
the
state.
a
fertilizing
company
in
alabama
is
going
to
--
that
takes
gas
from
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
going
to
pay
this
tax.
a
fertilizing
company
in
louisiana
that
takes
the
same
gas
does
not
pay
the
tax.
the
utility
companies
in
louisiana
pay
the
tax
--
do
not
pay
the
tax
on
gas
that
comes
from
the
outer
continental
shelf,
but
utility
companies
in
my
case
--
in
my
state
and
in
new
york
and
in
massachusetts,
and
all
of
the
other
states,
indeed
30
of
the
states
of
this
nation
will
pay
that
tax.
as
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
utility
tax
credit
bill
said
in
the
legislative
history
very
candidly
he
said,
“i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
the
folks
in
my
district
don't
have
higher
fuel
bills.”
well,
all
of
us,
especially
those
who
of
us
who
run
for
office
would
like
to
be
able
to
ensure
that
that
protection
is
afforded.
but
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
says,
“you
can't
do
that
and
make
interstate
commerce
bear
all
the
burden.”
and
finally,
what
the
--
the
essential
discrimination
in
this
case
and
professor
hellerstein,
in
his
--
in
his
lectures
in
tulane
not
so
long
ago
points
this
out.
the
essential
discrimination
in
this
case
is
that
an
owner
of
gas,
who
takes
the
gas
from
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
who
has
severance
tax
liability
in
the
state
takes
the
outer
continental
shelf
gas,
tax
free.
one
who
doesn't
do
business
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
does
have
those
severance
tax
credits,
he
pays
the
full
tax
and
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
precisely
why
the
commerce
clause
exists
to
prevent.
thank
you
very
much.
