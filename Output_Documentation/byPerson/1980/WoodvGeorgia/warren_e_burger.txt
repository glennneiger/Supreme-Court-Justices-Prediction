chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
wait
for
the
noise
to
subside,
counsel.
we'll
wait
for
a
moment
or
two,
here.
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
now,
mr.
zell.
chief
justice
burger
on
your
theory,
then,
the
court
is
powerless
to
impose
any
punishments?
chief
justice
burger
--does
this
record
show
from
what
resources
their
bond
was
provided,
if
they
were
indigent
and
couldn't
pay
the
fine,
the
bond
cost
them
some
money,
i
suppose,
in
georgia?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
this
record
show
about
their
previous
employer's
practice
in
paying
fines?
chief
justice
burger
are
these
petitioners
here
in
forma
pauperis?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
employer
was
just
treating
this
as
a
cost
of
doing
business,
sort
of
a--
chief
justice
burger
--licensing
fee?
chief
justice
burger
but
he
is
here
in
forma
pauperis,
now?
chief
justice
burger
oh,
the
employees.
what
would
happen
if--
--but
they're
not
working
there
anymore?
chief
justice
burger
you
were
not
a
court
appointed
counsel?
chief
justice
burger
so
he's
here
as
an
indigent,
in
forma
pauperis,
but
he
has
paid
counsel,
then,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
burger
well
you're
suggesting
that
paying
$5,000
is
not
somewhat
painful.
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
it
isn't
painful
if
you
have
to
go
out
and
borrow
it
and
put
a
mortgage
on
your
house?
chief
justice
burger
if
you
have
the
house.
chief
justice
burger
well
you're
not
suggesting
that
indigents
should
be
free
from
any
penalty
for
criminal
conduct?
chief
justice
burger
but
the
consequence
comes
out
that
way,
on
your
argument.
chief
justice
burger
and
you
think
it's
the
function
of
this
court
to
evaluate
considerations
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
burger
but
the,
we...
if
you
say
it's
a
consideration
there,
you're,
by
implication,
saying
we
must
pass
on
that
sometime.
chief
justice
burger
and
you
said
this
was
a
constitutional
issue.
chief
justice
burger
your
time
is
up.
but
just
one
question,
at
least
from
me.
pursuing
justice
blackmun's
question,
could
the
judge
under
georgia
law
have
said,
i
will
consider
probation
if
you
will
post
a
bond
to
guarantee
the
payment
of
your
fine
over
a
period
of
time,
as
a
guarantee
for
these
installments.
would
that
be
permitted
under
georgia
law?
chief
justice
burger
well
as
one
of
my
colleagues
noted,
it
isn't
our
business
to
try
to
write
georgia's
statute
on
that
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dunsmore.
chief
justice
burger
what
was
the
amount
of
that
bond?
chief
justice
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
where
this
indigent
got
the
money
to
pay
that?
chief
justice
burger
well
if
it's
not
in
the
record,
i
don't
want
you
to
pursue
it.
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
in
the
record.
chief
justice
burger
well
the
could
the
judge
have
revoked
the
then
pending
probation
because
of
that
conviction
of
a
subsequent
crime?
chief
justice
burger
what
does
the
record
show,
if
anything,
about
who
paid
the
bond
or
the
fee
of
$1,000,
or
more?
chief
justice
burger
the
bond
for
the...
continued
liberty,
while
this
case
is--
chief
justice
burger
--isn't
there
something
in--
chief
justice
burger
--well
wasn't
there
some
statement
by
counsel
at
one
of
these
hearings
that
the
employer
had
paid
the
bonds--
chief
justice
burger
did
they
ever
ask
the
court
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
installments
and
put
them
over
a
longer
period
of
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
