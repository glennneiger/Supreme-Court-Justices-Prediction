justice
white
what
were
the
sentences?
or,
how
much
jail
time
will
they
spend?
justice
white
well,
i...
but
the
sentence
was...
they
were
put
on
probation
first,
weren't
they?
justice
white
and
then--
justice
white
--and
was...
the
probation
was
the
same
length
as
their
sentences?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
so
they
go
back
and
serve
their--
justice
white
right.
well
they
will
also
go
to
jail
if
they
don't
live
up
to
the
other
terms
of
their
probation--
--that's
right.
--even
if
they
pay
the
$500.
justice
white
so
it
isn't
just
a
condition
that--
--one
of
several
conditions.
justice
white
right.
mr.
zell,
were
there
any
proceedings
against
the
employer?
justice
white
would
you...
what
if
the
judge
had
said
this,
"well
i'm
sentencing
you
to
a
year
in
jail,
but
i'm
going
to
put
you
on
probation
subject
to
normal
probation
conditions
and
i'm
also
going
to
fine
you
$5,000,
payable
in
installments
and
if
you
fail
to
pay
the
installments,
you
go
to
jail
for
ten
days.
"
that's
a
separate,
i
must
have
some
way
of...
something
to
take
the
place
of
the
fine,
but
i'll
just
send
you
to
jail
for
ten
days
if
you
don't
pay
the
fine.
but
of
course
you
are
subject
to
going
to
jail
for
a
year
if
you
don't
live
up
to
the
conditions
of
your
probation.
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
white
are
you
saying
that
all
criminal
statutes
that
says
30
days
or
$100
are
unconstitutional?
justice
white
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not;
i
don't
think
we've
held
that,
yet.
we've
specially
reserved
it.
and...
but
that's
your...
then
your
submission
is
that...
that
$100
or
one
day
is
bad?
justice
white
what?
justice
white
all
right,
but
that's
bad
to
apply
any
indigent?
justice
white
and
other
people
who
could
satisfy
that
condition,
but...
and
who
could
satisfy
all
the
conditions
stayed
out
of
jail?
justice
white
you
said
previous
fines?
justice
white
mr.
dunsmore,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
why
you
think
all
of
this
is
relevant.
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
it's
been
determined
by
your
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
established
at
the
revocation
hearing
that
these
defendants
were
not
able
to
pay
these
fines.
that's
what
the...
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
said
at
the
revocation
hearings
it
was
established
that
none
of
the
appellants
had
the
financial
resources
to
make
the
payments.
and
the
court
held,
nevertheless,
that
that
makes
no
difference,
that
you
may
incarcerate
these
defendants
for
failure
to
pay
for
the
balance
of
their
sentences,
in
one
case
the
remainder
of
a
two
year
sentence.
now,
isn't
that
the
issue
as
it
comes
here?
justice
white
well
what
difference
does
it
make
about
third
parties,
or
what
the
agreement
was
or
what
the
anticipation
of
the
judge
was?
justice
white
because
the
court
of
appeals
took
it
on
the
assumption
it
could
not...
that
it
had
been
determined
that
they
were
financially
unable
to
pay.
justice
white
why
don't
you
just
defend
that...
which
you
do,
i'm
sure,
you
defend
that...
that
even
if
they
couldn't
pay,
and
were
unable
to
pay,
it
was
quite
constitutional
to
put
them
in
jail?
justice
white
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
white
no,
i--
