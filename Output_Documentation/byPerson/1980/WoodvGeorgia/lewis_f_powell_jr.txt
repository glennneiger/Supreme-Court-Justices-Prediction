justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
second
case
is
here
from
the
georgia
court
of
appeals.
the
petitioners
are
three
employees
of
an
adult
movie
theater
and
bookstore
who
were
convicted
of
distributing
obscene
materials.
they
were
low
level
employees,
not
proprietors
or
managers
of
the
establishments.
nevertheless
they
were
sentenced
to
long
periods
of
probation
and
subjected
to
heavy
fines.
their
probations
later
were
revoked
when
they
were
unable
to
pay
the
fines.
at
that
time,
they
were
no
longer
employed.
throughout
the
proceedings
below,
petitioners
were
represented
by
a
lawyer
hired
and
paid
for
by
their
former
employer,
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
theater
and
bookstore.
this
employer
had
promised
them
to
pay
any
fines
that
may
be
imposed
as
a
result
of
their
work
for
his
establishments.
but
he
failed
to
do
so.
we
granted
this
case
to
decide
whether
revocation
of
probation
with
resulting
imprisonment
solely
because
of
inability
to
pay
fines
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
upon
consideration
of
the
case
however,
we
concluded
that
the
lawyer
who
had
represented
petitioners
may
have
had
a
disqualifying
conflict
of
interest.
if
in
fact
there
were
such
a
conflict,
petitioners
may
have
been
denied
due
process
of
law.
in
view
of
this
possibility
we
do
not
reach
the
equal
protection
issue
rather
we
remand
the
case
for
the
georgia
courts
to
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
disqualification
of
interest
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
justice
stewart
also
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
and
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
