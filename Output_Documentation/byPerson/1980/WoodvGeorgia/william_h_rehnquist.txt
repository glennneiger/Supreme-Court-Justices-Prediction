justice
rehnquist
well
doesn't
georgia
have
some
exemptions
to
its
garnishment
statute,
for
necessary
expenses
of
living?
justice
rehnquist
well
so
your
complaint
is
not
that
a
fine
was
levied
on
someone
who
couldn't
pay
it?
justice
rehnquist
but
that
the
fine
was
too
high?
justice
rehnquist
well
doesn't
that
suggest
some
validity
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
observation,
that
if
the
people
are
before
the
court,
but
not
for
the
first
time
or
the
second
time,
but
for
the
fifth
time,
and
the
court
feels
that,
you
know,
we
don't
want
to
warehouse
these
people
and
lock
them
up
with
murderers,
but
if
we
can't
do
anything
else
to
them...
if
they
are
indigent,
and
small...
or
the
small
time
fines
haven't
deterred
them
before,
isn't
there
going
to
be
a
tendency
to
at
least
send
them
to
the...
some
facility
for
confinement?
justice
rehnquist
well
is
that
really
a
very
commendable
motive,
that
the
employer
pays
their
fine
because
they
were
convicted
of
doing
something
that
was
illegal
under
georgia
law?
justice
rehnquist
is
this
a
common
provision
in
georgia,
between
employees
of
so
called
adult
bookstores
and
their
employers?
justice
rehnquist
you
received
a
call
from
the
court.
justice
rehnquist
but
not
from
the
third
party?
justice
rehnquist
well,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendants,
isn't
it
better
than
a
straight
sentence
from
the
beginning?
justice
rehnquist
well
but
wasn't
part
of
his
determination
the
fact
that
they
would
be
subject
to
some
penalty,
i.e.,
the
payment
of
a
fine?
justice
rehnquist
he
didn't
intend
to
let
them
off
scot
free?
and
it
wasn't
his
decision,
as
indicated
here,
that
they
shouldn't
be
imprisoned
if
they
paid
$500
a
month?
justice
rehnquist
well
we're
not
running
the
georgia
prison
system.
i
mean,
that's
up
to
georgia,
to
provide
it,
if
it
can...
if
it
falls
within
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
a
suspect
classification?
justice
rehnquist
as
in
san
antonio
v.
rodriguz?
justice
rehnquist
well
if
these
people
are
in
fact,
indigents
as
you
suggest,
putting
them
to
work
in
community
service
instead
of
incarcerating
them
isn't
going
to
enable
them
to
support
their
families,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
yet,
you
concede
that
the
judge
could
have
sentenced
them
ab
initio,
to
twelve
months?
justice
rehnquist
yes.
justice
rehnquist
well
but
isn't
that
a
typical
determination
with
a
case
of
non
violent,
first
or
second
offenders?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
he
squandered
the
money,
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
if
a
man
were
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
had
no
funds?
justice
rehnquist
would
you
say
he
couldn't
go
to
jail?
justice
rehnquist
but
it
isn't
part
of
the
trial
judge's
reasoning
that
you
want
to
put
as
few
people
in
jail
as
possible.
justice
rehnquist
and
if
he
knew
that
you
couldn't--
justice
rehnquist
--collect
the
fine
or
put
him
in
jail,
he...
he
probably
would
sentence
him
to
jail
in
the
first
place.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
zell,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
so,
supposing
that
an
armed
robber,
convicted
of
armed
robbery,
came
before
the
judge
for
sentencing.
under
your
going
around
in
lcircles
argument,
would
it
be
a
constitutional
defense
for
him
to
say
i
just
didn't
have
any
money,
i
couldn't
get
a
job
and
so
i
just
had
to
commit
this
armed
robbery?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
dunsmore,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
about
the
appendix
on
page
21,
and
it's
in
the
last
paragraph
there
where
that
court
states,
and
this
is
the
trial
court,
order
of
probation,
"it
is
further
ordered
that
the
court,
and
the
defendant
is
hereby
advised
that
the
court
may
at
any
time
revoke
or
modify
any
conditions
of
this
probation
or
change
the
period
of
probation,
and
may
discharge
the
defendant
from
probation.
"
was
any
application
made
in
this
case
to
discharge
the
defendant
from
probation?
