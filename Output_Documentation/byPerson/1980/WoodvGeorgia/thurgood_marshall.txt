mr.
zell,
do
you
have
pre
sentence
reports
in
georgia?
justice
marshall
well
don't
they
show
how
much
a
man
is
worth?
justice
marshall
so
the
judge
knew
that
he
had
enough
money
to
pay
that
fine,
didn't
he?
justice
marshall
can
i
assume
that?
justice
marshall
what
would
happen
if
the
pre
sentence
report
shows
that
mr.
jones
has
a
friend
by
the
name
of
mr.
smith
and
mr.
smith
will
give
him
a
thousand
dollars,
and
they
fined
him
a
thousand
dollars,
and
they're
not
working
together
or
anything,
this
is
just
a
friend;
would
the
court
be
entitled
to
go
back
on
that?
justice
marshall
on
the
fact
that
he
used
some
bad
information?
justice
marshall
well
when
you
get
through,
i
want
to
know
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case.
justice
marshall
would
you
at
that
time
tell
the
judge
that
the
man
couldn't
pay
the
fine?
justice
marshall
you'd
just
let
the
judge
go
down
that
road?
justice
marshall
now
you
want
to
complain
about
the
judge?
justice
marshall
you're
not
complaining
about
yourself
at
all,
are
you?
justice
marshall
but
you
didn't
represent
the
third
party,
you
represented
this
man?
justice
marshall
you
still
do?
justice
marshall
no.
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
i
still
want
to
know,
you
represent
them
officially
here?
justice
marshall
and
not
the
third
party?
justice
marshall
would
you
object
if
the
court
had
a
hearing
to
find
out
if
this
man
could
pay
$10.00
a
week?
justice
marshall
well
i
thought
so,
but
you
weren't
saying
it
right
then.
justice
marshall
all
right.
justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
suppose
a
man
has
got
the
money
and
he
is
sentenced
to
pay
$5,000
a
month,
which
is
no
problem
to
him.
but
he
starts
serving
the
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
year
1929
and
he
is
caught
along
with
everybody
else.
in
georgia,
what
happens?
is
there
any
relief
for
him?
justice
marshall
you
go
to
the
sentencing
judge?
justice
marshall
--mr.
attorney
general,
if
that's
true,
why
wasn't
the
owner
arrested?
justice
marshall
i
understand.
justice
marshall
isn't
the
judge
a
part
of
the
whole
thing?
justice
marshall
how
can
a
judge
take
the
word
of
a
man
who
is
the
criminal?
justice
marshall
and
the
only
thing
that
the
owner
is
doing
is
paying
additional
taxes.
justice
marshall
if
the
agreement
is
understood
between
the
prosecution,
the
defense
and
the
judge,
that
the
guilty
party
will
pay
the
fine
of
the
guys
that
are
convicted.
justice
marshall
is
that
all,
that's
understood?
do
you
have
any
problems
with
that?
justice
marshall
i
thought
you
said
that
that
was
stated
in
open
court.
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
the
solicitor,
i
said
somebody
did.
justice
marshall
and
the
solicitor--
justice
marshall
--was
there,
wasn't
he?
justice
marshall
so
he
heard
it,
didn't
he?
justice
marshall
would
it
be
the
same
as
a
dote?
justice
marshall
that
the
king
tendered
a
dote
says
to
the
court
that
i'll
pay
the
fine
for
these
guys?
justice
marshall
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
marshall
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
marshall
and
you
think
the
court
would
go
along
with
that?
