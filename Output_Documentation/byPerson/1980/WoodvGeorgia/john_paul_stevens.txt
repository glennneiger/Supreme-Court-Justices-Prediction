justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
dunsmore,
i
got
the
impression
from
your
adversary
that
the
problem
presented
by
this
case
is
somewhat
unique
to
georgia.
do
you
have
that
same
impression?
and
if
so,--
justice
stevens
--but
his
suggestion
seems
supported
by
the
fact
we've
had
two
previous
cases
from
georgia
where
parole
was
revoked
because
of
inability
to
pay
a
fine.
i
just
don't
know
whether
it
arises
in
other
jurisdictions
or
not
the
same
way.
