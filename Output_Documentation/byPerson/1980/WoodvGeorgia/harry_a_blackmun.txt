mr.
zell,
if
you
prevail
here,
what's
going
to
happen:
mandatory
imprisonment
in
every
case,
of
an
indigent?
justice
blackmun
i'm
asking
whether
your
argument
might
turn
out
to
be
counter
productive?
justice
blackmun
my
other
question
is,
have
these
prison
sentences
been
served?
justice
blackmun
yes.
justice
blackmun
so
they...
their
sentences
have
been
stayed?
justice
blackmun
and
they
have
not
been
served?
justice
blackmun
well
what
it
comes
down
to
is
to
find
a
punishment
that
is
available
for
imposition
on
him
and
i
suppose
some
people,
due
to
circumstances,
are
free
from
any
punishment
except
going
to
jail.
justice
blackmun
perhaps
i
misundertsood
mr.
zell,
but
i
thought
that
this
was
their
first
conviction.
