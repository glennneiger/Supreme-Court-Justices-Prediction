mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
judge
can
condition
probation
on
the
payment
of
a
fine,
revoke
that
period
of
probation
for
non
payment
of
the
fine,
particularly
when
the
individual
has
represented
to
the
court
that
they
had
the
funds
or
the
means
by
which
to
pay
the
fine.
underlying
that
consideration
is
whether
the
sentencing
judge
could
properly
consider
third
party
sources
as
assisting
the
individual
in
the
payment
of
the
fine.
now
this
case
does
not
involve,
as
some
cases
previously
to
the
court
have
provided,
extending
the
period
of
confinement
greater
than
allowed
by
statute.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
yes,
he
can
always
go
through
it
in
georgia,
at
any
time,
the
courts...
we
pointed
that
out
in
the
footnotes,
the
court
always
has
the
inherent
power
to
modify
a
sentence
or
to
release
the
individual
from
the
conditions
of
his
probation
at
that
time.
normal
procedure
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
cases,
i
could
not
indicate
to
you,
but
that
is
a
means
available
to
a
defendant.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
you
go
to
the
sentencing
judge
because
he
retains
jurisdiction
over
that
case,
during
that
time
that
the
individual
is
on
a
period
of
probation.
now,
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
that
the
individuals,
at
this
time,
are
not
in
confinement.
and
i
was
under
the
misapprehension,
and
i'll
correct
that,
on
page
9
of
my
brief,
and
i
indicated
that
confinement
resulted...
it
did
not,
as
mr.
zell
said,
initially.
i
think
the
important
factor
is
that
these
individuals
are
out
on
bond,
on
an
appeal
bond,
that
bond
was
posted
on
february
13,
1979,
which
was
the
date
when
the
judge
said
that
after
the
hearing
in
january,
of
'79,
if
you
don't
pay
the
arrears,
i'm
going
to
give
you
two
weeks
to
pay
the
arrearage
for
approximately
$1500,
then
i'm
going
to
revoke
probation.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
now
the
bond
for
mr.
wood
is
$20,000,
and
under
the
georgia
statutory
scheme,
the
maximum
amount...
or,
the
amount
that
would
have
to
be
paid
for
that
bond,
according
to
my
figures,
would
be
$1,025.
the
statute
is
georgia
code
27-501.
that
sets
out
the
fact
that
you
can't
charge
any
more
than
10
percent
of
the
first
five
hundred
dollars,
or
any
more
than
five
percent
on
amounts
over
$500.
as
to
the
other
two
petitioners,
ms.
allen
and
mr.
tante;
it
was
a
$10,000
bond
and
i
think
my
math
worked
out
to
something
like
525.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
no,
and
i
think
that
gets
into--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--i
think
the
interesting
part
of
the
case,
though,
which
the
court
can
consider,
is
in
our
appendix
a,
which
is
the
revocation
proceeding
in
january
of
1979,
mr.
zell
told
the
sentencing
judge,
the
trial
judge,
judge
alexander
that
these
individuals'
previous
fines
in
connection
with
other
cases,
had
been
paid
and
that
he
had
paid
them.
now,...
i
think--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
all
right.
if
i
can,
the
scenario
is,
this
is
their
first
conviction.
this
is
what
happened:
each
one
of
them
was
arrested
and
they
pursued
their
constitutional
right
to
submit
the
matter
before
a
jury;
a
jury
in
march
of
1977
found
them
guilty
as
charged
and
the
judge
at
that
time
said
i'm
going
to
put
your
sentence
at
12
months,
the
maximum
for
these
convictions
of
distributing
obscene
materials,
since
it's
considered
an
aggravating...
a
misdemeanor
of
a
high
and
aggravating
nature,
is
12
months
and
a
$5,000
fine
or
both.
now,
after
that
time,
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
then
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
then
a
writ
of
certiorari.
in
the
interim,
between
the
time
of
the
october
23,
1978
order
when
the
judge
says
all
right,
i'm
going
to...
the
terms
and
conditions
of
probation
start
on
this
date.
they
entered
pleas
of
guilty
to
subsequent
offenses.
it
was
those
subsequent
offenses
which
are
referred
to
in
our
appendix
a
on
the
brief
in
opposition
to
writ
of
certiorari,
where
mr.
zell
tells
the
judge
yes,
i
paid
the
fine,
or
the
employers
gave
me
the
money
to
pay
these
fines--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--yes,
he
could
have,
i
believe...
well,
i
believe
he
could
have.
well,
i
think
the
important
part
is,
of
the
case,
is
that
he
had...
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
sentencing
discretion
of
a
trial
judge.
what
may
he
consider?
can
he
consider
other
things?
now,
in
the
united
states
v.
grayson,
this
court
said
yes,
the
judge
could
consider
the
demeanor
of
the
defendant
when
he
said
you
know,
i
find
your
defense
to
be
highly
incredible
and
you
know,
basically,
i
think
you're
putting
the
sham
on
the
court.
by
analogy,
cannot
the
trial
judge
consider
representations
to
him
by
third
parties
that
we
will
pay
the
fines?
now,
what
does
this
do
in
the
mind
of
the
trial
judge?
he
says
yes,
we're
going
to
put
you,
i'm
going
to
give
you
12
months,
and
a
$5,000
fine.
or
the
12
months
and
$5,000
authorized
by
law.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
now,
the
bond
as
to--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--well
i--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice
burger,
it
was
not
until
the
27th
of
october
that
i
found
out
that
these
individuals
had
a
bond
posted.
now
perhaps
i
was
negligent
in
some
regard
in
not
checking
this
out
sooner,
but
in
part,
i
relied
in
part
on
the
solicitor's
office
to
give
me
some
of
the
background
material
that
i
initially
supplied
the
court
with
in
our
brief...
petition
for
certiorari--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--oh
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
yes,
that's
in
regard
to...
well,
two
things.
i
believe
the
petitioners
all
said,
and
this
is
important,
i
think,
they
said
that
when
we
were
employed,
our
employers
told
us
that
if
at
any
time
during
our
employment
you're
arrested
or
anything
we
will
pay
your
fines,
we
will
make
sure
that
bond
is
arranged
and
we
will
provide
you
with
legal
representation.
now
in
the
appendix,
there
is
indication
that
the
king
bonding
company
paid
the
bonds
for
these
individuals
when
they
were
arrested...
and,
i
would
assume,
the
continuing
appeal
bonds
until
october
23rd,
1978.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
no
idea,
and
i
cannot
speak
for
the
solicitor
of
fulton
county.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
now
these
individuals
also
indicated...
and
i
think
the
representation
is,
too,
properly
to
the
court,
that
here,
the
employer
has...
the
employer
even
told
one
of
them,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
tante,
there
was
an
indication
in
the
probation
revocation
hearing,
well
how
did
you
know
to
get
mr.
zell?
i
believe
there
is
testimony
in
there
that
he
had
represented
them
previously.
and
i
believe
there's
also
testimony
in
that
revocation
hearing
that
the...
it
had
been
suggested
by
the
employer
to
contact
mr.
zell.
and
there's
also
an
indication
in
the
record
that
mister...
an
inference,
anyway,
because
i
don't
think
it
comes
out
clearly...
an
inference
that
the
employer
paid
mr.
zell's
fee.
now,
i
think
we
need
to--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--none
on
the
record,
now.
and
i
say
that
with...
well
for
the
qualified
remark,
that
on
page
71,
of
the
probation
revocation
hearing,
there
is
an
indication
from
mr.
zell
that
i
wrote
the
court.
but
i
think
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
in
this
case,
at
the
time
the
sentences
were
imposed,
the
defendants...
petitioners
in
this
case...
sat
back
in
silence.
they
never
went
in
to
the
probation
officers
at
that
time
and
said,
you
know,
we
can't
pay.
there's
an
indication
that
the
probation
officer
said
we'll
accept
partial
payments,
and
they
never
went
in
and
told
the...
indicated
to
their
probation
supervisors
that
you
know,
we
could
pay
a
lesser
amount.
they
refused,
and
i
use
the
word
refused,
to
pay
the
fine
because
they
were
under
the
impression,
and
i
think
rightly
so,
from...
on
the
conditions
of
employment...
that
their
employers
would
pay
the
fine.
and
therefore
they
took
no
action.
now,
i
think
what
that
amounts
to
in
this
case,
regardless
of
funds,
is
are
we
not
deceiving
a
trial
judge?
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says,
let
the
judge
go
down
the
road,...
you
know,
many
times
you
say
well
can
silence
be
a
condoning
aspect?
i
think
it
can,
in
this
situation.
i
think
we're
talking
about
the
integrity
of
the
sentencing
function
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
to
allow
criminal
defendants
to
mislead
a
judge
or,
that
is,
to
not
bring
to
his
attention
facts
that
are
different,
let
the
judge
rely
on
it,
get
the
benefit
of
a
lesser
sentence,
and
then
come
back
in
and
say,
gee
i'm
sorry,
we
just
didn't
have
any
money.
particularly
when
you
had
one
year
and
seven
months...
19
months
intervening
from
march
of
1977
to
october
of
1978
when
they
were
actually
put
under
probation
supervisors.
in
that
period
of
time
they
had
an
opportunity
to
check
with
their
employer,
and
say,
are
you
going
to
pay
the
fine,
the
record
is
silent,
they
did
nothing.
they
never,
at
any
time,
went
and
tried
to
pay
the
fine.
there's
no
showing
that
they
went
out
to
see
if
they
could
borrow
any
money,
to
my
understanding.
all
of
them
were
earning
some
sort
of
money
and
and
the
word
indigent,
i
think,
has
been
used
loosely
in
this
case.
one
individual
making
$525
a
month,
another
one
$400
to
$500
a
month,
and
the
one
lady
was
on
unemployment.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
no,
there
was
no
effort
made
at
any
time
to
reduce
the
installments
or
to
seek
anything
else.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
page
69
of
the
appendix...
appendix
a,
which
is
not
the
brown
appendix,
but
the
one
appended
to
our
brief
in
opposition...
the
judge,
judge
alexander,
says
i
didn't
ask
the
question
because
i
thought
i
could
enforce
the
agreement.
right
there,
there's
evidence
right
there
that
the
judge
was
under
the
impression
that
the
third
parties
would
pay
this
fine.
now
why
should
the
judge
be
able
to
look
to
third
parties?
in
the
probation
context,
just
as
if
we're
putting
the
individual
out
on
parole,
we're
trying
to
find
an
alternative
to
confinement.
now
an
alternative
to
confinement
has
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation.
we
want
to
deminimize
the
amount
of
supervision
that
the
court
has
to
engage
in.
now
if
the
court
can
look
to
a
citizen,
an
employer
or
somebody
in
the
community,
that
aids
the
court
in
its
carrying
out
of
its
rehabilitative
function.
particularly,
you
know,
in
the
context
when
we
put
a
man
on
parole;
one
of
the
things
parole
boards
generally
ask...
where
are
you
going
in
the
community,
who
will
vouch
for
you,
do
you
have
a
job,
is
there
somebody
in
the
community
grassroots
that
we
can
look
to
to
assist
us
in
rehabilitating
you?
now
that
same
factor
must
be
viewed
in
the
eyes
of
the
sentencing
judge.
now,
mr.
zell
and
petitioners
say
well
gee,
that
was
an
illegal
agreement.
that
is,
illegal
to
the
extent
that
you
pre
suppose
that
the
individual
was
hired
with
the
purpose
of
violating
the
law.
but
i
think
the
judge
rationally
could
look
to
the
employers
because
if
they
put
a
stake
up
in
the
community
for
an
employer,
there's
going
to
be
continued
employment.
now
one
of
the
terms
of
the
probation
was
that
they
continue
on
employment.
if
that
individual
is
working
he
can
contribute
to
his
family.
he
doesn't
become
a
burden
to
society.
the
collection
of
fine
in
this
case
is
not
like
tate
v.
short,
where
they
said
it's
a
revenue
measure.
the
judge
in
this
case
is
looking
to
third
parties
because
they
are
going
to
help
in
the
rehabilitative
aspect
of
that
individual.
and
also--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--a
party?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's...
in
any
case--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--i
don't
consider
it
paying
additional
taxes,
and
i
think--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--well
i
think
we're
going
one--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--well
let
me
explain
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
we're
reading
too
much
into
it
and
we're...
we're
reading
too
much
into
it,
because
that
assumes
that
the
solicitor
knew
that
the
employer
was
going
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
the
solicitor
stated
it
in
open
court.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
right,
and
that
was
the
petitioners--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
right.
but
i
think
the
key,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
court,
is
that
when
an
employer
in
this
situation
says
that
he
will
vouch
for
this
individual...
particularly
rehabilitative
efforts...
is
he
not
telling
the
court
that
he
is
going
to
see
to
it
that
his
conduct
conforms
to
the
law?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
would
it
be
the
same
as--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--i
think
you
could
say--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--i
think
you
could
say,
because--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--isn't
that
an
indication
that
he's
got
a
stake
in
this
individual
and
that
he's
going
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
law?
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well
i
don't
know,
but
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
basis,
a
rational
basis
for
the
court
to
consider;
that
if
somebody's
going
to
pay
some
money
out
for
them,
are
they
going
to
continue
to
hire
this
individual
and
why
would
they
pay
the
fines
if
they
thought
that
the
conduct...
to
continue,
would
they
continue
to
violate
the
law?
you
know,
mr.
zell
says
that
to
continue
to
work
there
would
mean
that
they
would
violate
the
terms
of
their
probation;
that
assumes
that
the
conduct
that
the
employer
in
this
case
has
vouched
for
is
going
to
continue.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
make
that
assumption.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
said--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--well
because--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--well
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--right.
and--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
one
of
the
things,
we're
not...
there's
no
vindictiveness,
we're
not
increasing
the
sentence
at
all.
the
sentence
was--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--you
know,
12
months,
$5000
fine.
he
could,
and
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
and
you
said
earlier,
he
could
have
slap,
right
off
the
board,
said,
you
know,
in
you
go
and
$5,000
fine.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well
that
question
is--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--a
little
more,
that's
a
little
more
difficult
to
add,
and
i
think
that
assumes...
and
would
put
us
in
a
more
difficult
position,
because
there,
there's
an
indication
of
vindictiveness.
and
as
mr.
zell
said,
an
illusory.
but
there's
no
evidence
of
any
vindictiveness
at
all
in
this
case.
i
think
that
is
an
essential
matter.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well
i
agree,
i
think
it
makes
it
far
more
difficult,
because
they
are...
impuning
bad
faith
to
the
judge
and
i
don't
think,
on
the
record
here,
there's
anything
to
impune
lack
of
judicial
integrity
on
the
part
of
the
sentencing
judge.
i
don't
think
we
can
go
that
far,
to
say
that.
and
then
we're
hypothesizing
and
going
to
all
sorts
of
realms
that
are
not
in
the
confines
of
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
well
i'm
not
too
sure
of...
when
he
said
unique
to
georgia...
i
take
it,
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
judges
don't
place
individuals
on,
let's
say,
spend
five
nights
in
the
county
jail
or
work
for
a
health
facility.
i
don't
think
that's
unique,
because
i
have...
and
this
is
outside
the
record,
i
have
heard
from
other
individuals
that...
where
individuals
haven't
had
the
fine,
that
you
know,
they
said,
well...
like
for
example,
in
a
traffic
case,
spend
one
weekend
a
month
driving
around
with
the
hospital
ambulance
authority
or
something
like
that.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
unique
to--
mr.
john
w.
dunsmore,
jr.
--mr.
justice
stevens,
i
couldn't...
couldn't
tell
you
that.
but
i
don't
think
that
it...
you
know,
that
it's
unique,
because
i
do
know
from
some
limited
experience
outside,
that
you
know,
other
alternatives,
depending
on
who
the
judge
is.
but
what
we're
getting
back
to,
or
what
i
believe
we
need
to
get
back
to
is,
the
sentencing
discretion
of
the
judge
and
the
fact
that
other
alternatives
are
available
or
he
could
consider
other
alternatives,
is
it
unconstitutional
to
consider
financial
resources,
and
is
it
unconstitutional
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
sentence
which
is
prescribed
by
law?
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
faced
with,
and
we
say
it's
not.
and
we
say,
particularly,
that
it's
not,
because
there
is
some
element
of
deception
in
this
case.
it
was,
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
you
know,
leading
the
judge
down
the
path.
i,
as
attorney,
and
even
as
a
citizen,
would
find
that
somewhat
disturbing
and
irreprehensible
that
somebody
sits
down
and
misinterprets
or
misleads
the
court,
particularly
in
the
context
that
we're
brought
up...
particularly
the
aura
of
the
court.
--i
think
most
criminal
defendants
and
most
individuals,
when
they
are
faced
in
a
court
situation,
tend
to
be
honest.
now,
and
i'm
not
supposing
this
case
that
the
defendants
were,
you
know,
were
less
than
honest,
but
they
didn't
need
to
speak
up
and
say
the
third
party
is
paying
the
fine.
i
said
that
after
19
months,
particularly
on
october
23,
1978,
or
even
during
that
period
of
time,
why
didn't
they
go
to
their
attorney
and
say
look,
there's
just
no
way
we
can
pay
it.
why
wait
three
months
until
the
solicitor
goes
in
and
says
i
want
an
order
to
revoke
your
probation?
where
is
the
good
faith
effort
on
their
part?
and
i
think
that's
fundamental.
i
think
we
need
to
reach
that
issue
and
i
think
in
reaching
it,
we
would
hope
that
the
court
would
say
that
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
did
not
abuse
his
discretion.
and
we
thank
you
for
that.
