mr.
glenn
zell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
issue
that
was
left
open
in
tate
v.
short,
and
that
is,
may
a
trial
judge
revoke
the
probation
of
the
probationer
or
offender
if
he
does
not
have
the
funds
to
make
the
monthly
payments.
the
facts
in
this
case
are,
i
think,
rather
clear.
there
are
three
probationers,
of
course;
three
petitioners
in
this
court.
raymond
wood,
edna
allen,
and
james
tante.
they
were
convicted
several
years
ago
of
distributing
obscene
materials.
the
records
show
that
mr.
wood
was
a
clerk
in
a
bookstore...
no
dispute
about
that...
ms.
allen
was
a
projectionist
in
a
theater,
and
mr.
tante
was
the
projectionist
in
that
theater.
the
fine
imposed
on
mr.
tante
and
ms.
allen
was
a
$5,000
fine
and
12
months
on
probation...
that
was
after
the
conviction.
they
were
to
pay
that
fine
as
directed,
which
was
$500
per
month,
so
they
would
have
paid
the
fine
in
approximately
10
months.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
wood
was
convicted
in
two
counts
and
he
received
a
$5,000
fine
in
each
count,
to
run
consecutively,
and
12
months
on
probation.
therefore,
he
had
a
24-month
sentence
and
a
$10,000
fine,
payable
again
at
the
rate
of
$500
per
month
over
a
period
of
20
months.
thereafter
i
appealed
the
case
to
the
georgia
court
of
appeals,
and
i
lost.
i
then
certioraried
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
certiorari
was
denied.
i
then
certioraried
this
court,
and
cert
was
denied
with
some
justices
dissenting.
the
case
came
back
to
the
trial
court,
through
remittitur,
that
is,
and
of
course
while
the
case
was
on
appeal
in
georgia,
as
in
most
states
in
the
federal
system,
the
three
petitioners,
or
offenders,
defendants,
were
not
on
probation.
the
conviction,
i
think,
was
in
march
of
'77,
the
remittiturs
came
back
in
october
of
1978,
and
at
that
point,
the
three
offenders,
the
three
defendants,
started
serving
their
probation,
right
at
the
last
week
of
october.
and
the
record
shows
that
the
probation
officers
told
each
one...
there
was
a
different
officer
for
each
defendant...
i
don't
know
whether
there
were
three
different
probation
officers...
but
anyway,
each
one
said
you
must
pay
your
fine
at
the
end
of
next
month,
at
the
rate
of
$500
per
month.
in
the
record,
at
page
71,
i
notified
the
court
immediately
when
they
were
put
on
probation
that
they
did
not
have
the
funds
and
the
fines
should
be
remitted
or
suspended
or
some
action
taken,
because
there's
going
to
be
a
problem
in
this
case
on
this
$20,000
in
fines.
mr.
glenn
zell
oh
no,
the
court
is
certainly...
has
certain
powers
to
enforce
a...
payments
on
the
installment
basis.
obviously
you
have
your
civil
penalties
certainly,
garnishment,
levy
on
any
property.
for
example,
mr.
tante
was
a
prison
guard
at
this
time,
while
he
was
on
probation.
mr.
wood
had
a
job
at
a
trucking
company,
i
believe,
he
could
have
been
garnished.
and
ms.
allen,
unfortunately,
was
on
unemployment
compensation
and
i
don't
think
you
can
garnish
that,
i'm
not
sure
if
you
can.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes,
there's
a
certain
percentage
after...
i
think
it's,
it
used
to
be
50
percent,
and
it's
a
little
lower,
but
there's
a
certain
percentage
you
can
only
take
out
for
garnishment.
and
certainly
some
small
sum
of
money
could
have
been
affected
by
garnishment
at
this
point.
mr.
glenn
zell
not
at
all.
mr.
glenn
zell
correct.
well
that,
and
commensurate
with,
first
of
all,
the
administration
of
justice...
what
do
you
do
with
people
who
violate
the
law,
and
the
judge,
trial
judge,
makes
a
determination
that
these
people
can
be
released
on
the
streets,
in
society,
in
public.
they
are
not
a
danger,
they
shouldn't
be
incarcerated,
they
shouldn't
be
warehoused...
so
to
speak.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i'd
like
to
think,
in
our
system
of
justice,
that
trial
judges
will
not
take
that
position.
i'm
sure
some
will.
and
i'd
like
to
think
that
a
trial
judge--
mr.
glenn
zell
--it
could,
yes.
i'm
aware
of...
some
trial
judges
have
told
me
that
if
they
can't
lock
up
an
indigent
defendant
on
probation,
they're
going
to
get
straight
time
sentences.
i'm
sure
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
glenn
zell
in
this
case?
mr.
glenn
zell
oh
no,
they've
been...
the
judge
let
them
stay
out
on
bond
pending
this
appeal,
because
they
would
have
served
their
sentence
if
they
had
been
incarcerated.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
mr.
tante
received...
and
ms.
allen,
received
a
12-month
sentence
each.
under
the
computation,
this
is
a
high
and
aggravated
misdemeanor;
they
would
serve,
they
get
four
days--
mr.
glenn
zell
--yes.
and
they
served
almost
three
months
of
that
sentence.
mr.
glenn
zell
they
have
nine
left.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
nine
months
less
good
time,
which
is
four
days
a
month
in
this
case;
which
would
be
36
days
less
nine
months,
and
they'd
serve
about
eight
months.
mr.
wood
has
2
years,
24
months
on
probation;
he
has
served,
again,
three
months,
so
he
has
21
left
to
go,
less
four
days
a
month,
for
the
remaining
21
months--
mr.
glenn
zell
--yes.
the
bond
was
provided
for
by
their
previous
employer.
he
put
up
the
bond
for
them.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
what
happened
was,
and
it's
in
the
record,
of
course,
that
they
were
first
fined
in
this
case,
and
then
thereafter
they
were
charged
again
in
another
case,
so
that
each
one
was,
and
a
small
fine
was
imposed
and
paid
by
their
employer.
paid
by
their
employer,
through
me...
the
fine
was
paid,
and
they
received
something
like
very
small
suspended
sentences.
the
fines,
i
might
add,
it's
on
the
record,
were
much
smaller
than
this
case,
they
were
$750
fines,
something
like
that.
and
then
when
the
remittitur
came
down
in
the
first
appeal,
they
were...
the
employer
did
not
pay
the
fines
in
this
case,
for
certain
reasons
such
as
a
different
change
of
attitude
and
a
different
employer--
mr.
glenn
zell
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
okay,
let
me
just
relay
a
little
chronology.
the
second
cases
were
imposed
after
this
sentence.
now
this
was
their
first
conviction.
they
stayed
in
the...
stayed
working
at
the
theater
and
bookstore,
and
they
were
arrested
and
pled
guilty
and
received
a
fine
thereafter
this
sentence
though.
and
thereafter,
they
were
before
different
judges,
and
they
received
a
much
more
modest
fine,
i
think
something
under...
less
than
a
thousand
dollars.
and
it
was
paid
by
their
employer
because
they
were
working
there,
they
were
useful
to
the
employer
to
keep
working
at
the
theater
and
bookstore.
then
when
they
went
on
probation
they
had
to
quit.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
certainly
you
can't
enforce
any
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
it
would
be
against
public
policy,
like
enforcing
a
gambling
contract;
he
promised
to
pay
it,
in
some
instances
he
did
pay
the
fine.
as
soon
as
they
left
work,
he
didn't
pay
the
fines.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes
and
no.
it...
many
times
the
employer
has
paid
the
fines
for
employees,
many
times...
many
times
he
has
not.
i
just
filed
a
cert
in
this
court
last
week
involving
a
case
called
simpson
v.
georgia,
in
which
he
received
a
$20,000
fine
in
a
different
theater,
different
business,
and
he's
supposed
to
pay
$1,000
a
month.
and
he
was
a
short
order
cook.
and
the
judge
again
revoked
his
probation
because
he
did
not
pay
the
$1,000
a
month.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
what
happened--
mr.
glenn
zell
--the
judge
knew...
well
here's
what
happened,
your
honor...
being,
as
a
practical
matter,
when
they
were
convicted
in
the
first
instance,
the
judge,
judge
alexander,
was
aware
of
what
they
were
doing;
they
were
making
nominal
amounts
of
money
as
a
clerk/projectionist.
i'm
sure
the
judge
thought,
it's
rather
obvious
from
the
record,
that
he
thought
if
he
imposed
this
large
fine
their
employer
would
pay
it.
i'm
sure
that
was
the
thrust
of
why
the
fine
was
so
heavy,
was
so
large,
your
employer
will
pay
it,
based
on
maybe
other...
other
cases,
or
at
prodding
of
the
prosecutors,
saying
fine
and
dandy,
don't
worry,
it
will
be
taken
care
of.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct,
sort
of
licensing,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
no.
these
people
are
the
mere
employees--
mr.
glenn
zell
--that's
right.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,--
mr.
glenn
zell
--certainly,
he
should,
the
court...
again--
mr.
glenn
zell
--well
certainly
he
should...
the
judge
should
modify
the
condition
of
probation
and
the
fine...
if
there
was
some
misinformation.
obviously,
or
even
a
promise
by
the
defendant...
how
many
defendants
can
afford--
mr.
glenn
zell
--no,
there
was
no
representation
made.
the
trial
was--
mr.
glenn
zell
--that's
correct.
what
happened
is,--
mr.
glenn
zell
--well,
i
mean
that's--
mr.
glenn
zell
--well,
what
happened
is,
the
trial
was
over.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
at
that
point,
the
prosecutor...
and
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
can...
prodded
the
judge
to
impose
a
large
fine.
that
normally
is
done
in
these
cases,
large
fines.
the
judge
was
aware
of
their
employment
and
i
think
the
judge,
as
in
many
of
these
cases,
felt
that
a
third
party
would
pay
the
fine.
there
was
no...
we
do
not
tell
the
judge
the
third
party
would
pay
the
fine;
we
just...
the
judge
was
aware
of
the
facts.
i
did
not
know
if
the
third
party
would
pay
the
fine
at
that
point,
there
was
no
guarantee,
so
to
speak,
at
that
point.
the
case
was
then
appealed.
we
did
not...
they
asked
for
a
large
fine,
it
was
just
a
prodding
of
the
prosecutor,
and--
mr.
glenn
zell
--at...
during
the
trial
in
the
first
instance,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
represent
the
third
party?
mr.
glenn
zell
the
defendants?
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
oh,
before
this
court,
yes,
i
do.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct,
i
was
not.
mr.
glenn
zell
no.
the
defendants
in
this
case,
the
way
it
came
about,
was,
i
received
a
call...
i
wrote
the
court
letter,
felt
obligated
to
let
the
court
know
that
the
defendants
did
not
have
the
money
after
the
appeal
was
terminated,
and
they
were
no
longer
working
for
the
owner
of
the
theater,
and
i
notified
the
court
that
they
did
not
have
the
funds
and
to
please
take
some
action,
that
they
no
longer
worked
in
there
and
there
was
going
to
be
some
problem,
they
did
not
have
the
money
and
it
would
not
be
forthcoming.
the
court
chose
not
to
take
any
action,
this
is
in
the
record,
page
71.
and
they
continued
to
report
on
probation,
and
that's
the
last
i
heard
of
it.
i
then
received
a
call,
the
first
week
of
january,
saying
that
they
want
you
down
in
court,
that
i
represent
these
three
defendants
and
would
i
come
down
to
court
to
represent
them.
i
contacted
the
three
defendants
and
i
asked
them,
did
they
have
money
for
counsel
and
did
they
want
me
to
represent
them,
i
would
be
glad
to.
and
they
said
yes,
we
want
you
as
our
lawyer,
you're
familiar
with
our
case.
and
so
i
went
down
to
court
to
represent
them
at
that
point.
mr.
glenn
zell
several...
from
the
defendants,
from
the
court,
from
the
solicitor...
concerning
the
hearing,
i
received
a
notice
of
the
hearing
date,
and
of
course,
the
defendants
called
me
and
notified
me
that
they
were
in
some
trouble
and
what
could
i
do
for
them.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
that's
correct;
not
from
a
third
party.
mr.
glenn
zell
the
defendants.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
i
have
not
been
paid
for
this
case
and
that's
in
the
record.
i
think
the
solicitor
brought
that
out
aptly
during
the
trial
that
i
had
represented
the
defendants,
but
i
was
paid
by
the
theater
owner
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
when
they
were
working
for
the
theater
owner.
but
as
soon
as
they
were
put
on
probation
their
employment
was
terminated
and
therefore
the
ties
were
severed
with
the
third
party,
or
the
employer.
mr.
glenn
zell
absolutely.
mr.
glenn
zell
okay.
at
that
point,
the
fines
were
imposed,
that's
correct.
there
was
no--
mr.
glenn
zell
--absolutely,
yes.
it
was
a
condition
of
probation.
mr.
glenn
zell
within
the
statute,
yes.
they
were...
that
is,
the
maximum
fine
is
$5,000.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think
that's
the
reach
in
this
case.
it's
just
an
unreasonable
condition.
mr.
glenn
zell
it
becomes...
that's
correct,
it
was
an
illusory
sentence,
gives
them
a
taste
of
liberty
to
see
what
they
could
raise,
and
if
you
can't
raise
the
money,
in
prison
you
go.
it's
really
an
illusory
sentence.
that's
what
i
point
out
in
my
brief.
mr.
glenn
zell
no
question
about
it.
but
what
do
you
do
when
the
judge
makes
a
determination
and
assume
he
did,
that
these
people
should
not
be
put
in
prison?
mr.
glenn
zell
well--
mr.
glenn
zell
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
hoping
that--
mr.
glenn
zell
--no
question
about
it,
that's
correct.
and
all
i'm
saying
before
this
court
is
that
when
you
have
the
situation,
is
that
other
alternatives
should
be
made
available
to
the
court,
and
for
the
defendants,
such
as
community
service
work,
it
would
be
much
more
constructive.
how
does
it
serve
the
administration
of
justice,
the
prison
system;
for
example,
in
georgia,--
mr.
glenn
zell
--yes,
but
how
does
that
help
further
the
objective
in
this
case?
why
do
you
want
to
incarcerate
somebody
for
not
having
the
money?
what...
then
you
have
this
classification,
suspect
classification,
poverty
v.
non
poverty--
mr.
glenn
zell
--well
i--
mr.
glenn
zell
--well,
i
took
the
position
in
my
brief,
and
i
take
it
now,
that
in
social
and
economic
policies,
it
perhaps
is
not.
but
involving
criminal
justice,
it
should
be.
certainly,
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
money
and
the
man
go
scot
free,
such
in
this
case,
what
if
one
of
the
probationers
came
up
with
the
money?
mr.
wood,
was
able
to
raise
the
money,
went
back
into
business
and
that's
open
to
him,
perhaps,
goes
back
in
the
adult
book
business,
gets
the
money,
and
pays
his
fine;
he
goes
scot
free,
so
to
speak.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
it's
painful
if
you
don't
have
it.
i'm
saying
that
if
the
person,
they
go
and
steal
it--
mr.
glenn
zell
--it
certainly
is,
if
you
have
the
financial
resources
to
borrow
the
money.
mr.
glenn
zell
if
you
have
the
house.
if
you
have--
mr.
glenn
zell
--not
at
all;
of
course
not.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
if...
if
you
use
money
as
the
criteria
and
the
lack
of
money
to
go
to
jail.
and
i
think
we
have
millions
of
people
unemployed
in
this
country,
at
the
present
time.
i
think
it
doesn't
serve
any
purpose,
any
purpose,
to
lock
up
people
who
do
not
have
the
money.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
what
you
do
is,
and
this
is
just
a
suggestions,
i
mean
not
the
only
suggestion,
is
that
if
you
give
them
community
service
work,
perhaps
on
weekends,
at
nights...
there
are
many
ways
to
serve
the
community,
and
much
more
productive
for
the
community
for
the
system,
help
the
society
in
which
they
committed
the
wrong;
it's
certainly
much
more
noble
than
to
just
lock
somebody
up
behind
bars
for
7
or
8
months
because
they
don't
have
the
money.
this
case
involves,
and
i'm
sure
the
judge
felt,
and
i
conceded,
that
a
third
party
would
pay
the
money.
and
it
has
not
been
forthcoming.
that's...
obviously
the
judge
had
that
basis.
this
is
similar
in
the
hunter
v.
dean
case,
in
which
this
case
granted
cert.
it
was
a...
if
you
remember,
it
was
like
a
10-year
sentence
to
be
placed
on
probation
if
you
paid
a
$2,000
fine
in
advance.
the
defendant
could
not...
made
a
representation
he
could
pay
the
money,
he
could
not
pay
it.
and
he
was
locked
up.
and
in
barnett
v.
hopper,
he
granted
cert
in
that
case
as
well
and
vacated
it
as
moot.
same
representation
was
made,
i
can
pay
the
money
if
you'll
just
give
me
probation.
and
the
judge
did
and
he
couldn't
pay
the
money,
and
the
question
is,
do
you
lock
people
up
where
they
don't
have
the
money?
there
should
be
other
alternative
means.
this
involves
traffic
cases,
misdemeanors
or
felonies.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
he
made
a
determination
they
should
be
on
probation
at
that
point,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
oh
no,
no.
well,
is
this--
mr.
glenn
zell
--yes.
they
could
go
on
probation,
but
they
should
pay
$500
a
month
while
they
are
on
probation.
mr.
glenn
zell
and
if
they
don't
pay
that
$500
a
month,
they
are
to
go
to
jail.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
right,
that's...
which
is
in
the
appendix,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
in
this
case,
no.
there
was
none.
they
did
not
proceed
against
the
employer.
why,
i
don't
remember
why,
i'm
not
sure
why.
it
was
merely
against
the
two
employees.
and
clearly
again,
the
trial
judge
relied
on
the
employer,
frankly,
i
think,
to
pay
the
fines.
and
now
he's
not
going
to
do
it,
because
of
change
of
ownership,
i
might
add.
he's
gone
now,
and
the
money
is
not
forthcoming.
and
i
don't
see
how,
under
tate
v.
short
and
williams
v.
illinois,
that
you
could...
this
court,
could
take
the
position
to
say
that
a
man
who
doesn't
have
the
funds
goes
to
jail
when
the
man
or
the
defendant
who
has
the
funds,
able
to
raise
it
through
employee,
employer
or
a
friend,
does
not
go
to
jail.
how
do
you
square
this
case
with
tate
case
and
the
williams
case?
mr.
glenn
zell
in
the
very
beginning.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
he
felt
that
they
were
good
subjects,
fit
subjects,
to
be
on
probation.
that
they
should
not
be
incarcerated...
he
made
that
determination.
mr.
glenn
zell
generally
speaking,
i
would
say
so,
yes.
the...
i
might
add
that
the
american
bar
association
of
standards
relating
to
sentencing
suggests...
i
mean,
the
judge
imposes
a
sentence,...
that
he
look
at
the
profitability
in
the
crime,
non
violent
crime,
but
it
also
suggests,
american
bar
association,
that
they
not
revoke
the
man's
probation
if
he
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
pay
the
fine.
and
in
all
law
review
articles
i've
read,
and
all
the
cases
i
could
find,
there's
not
one
case
except
in
georgia
as
far
as
i
know
in
shepherdizing
tate
and
williams,
where
a
court
has
said
if
you
don't
have
the
money
on
the
installment
basis,
you
go
to
jail.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think
so,
yes.
i
don't
think
a
man
should
serve
one
day
in
jail
based
on
his
wealth.
i
think
that's...
should
be
a
suspect
category,
if
it
isn't
already
under
griffin
v.
illinois
case.
and
i
think
that
that
should
be
a
criteria.
it
serves
no
purpose
to
either
raise
revenue,
punish
the
defendant...
because
he
sits
in
jail
knowing
that
if
he
had
the
money,
he'd
be
out,
while
other
defendants
and
other
clients
i've
had,
have
paid
the
fine
and
are
not
sitting
in
jail.
i
think
it
causes--
mr.
glenn
zell
--under
your
decisions,
yes.
if
you
don't
have
the
money.
mr.
glenn
zell
no.
mr.
glenn
zell
only
if
the
individual
does
not
have
the
funds--
mr.
glenn
zell
--yes,
or
a
person
who
has
not
squandered
the
money
away,
has
not
been
negligent,
willful;
that
seems
to
be
the
federal...
at
least
in
the
circuit,
i'm
from
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fourth
circuit,
where
they've
reached
that
issue.
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i
think
then
the
court,
such
as
in
a...
i'm
using
an
analogy
as
in
a
divorce
rule,
in
a
man
supporting
his
family.
if
he
squanders
away
money
that
he
didn't
give
to
his
family,
he
could
be
held
in
contempt
of
court.
and
i
think
this
would
be
similar.
if
he
squandered
the
money
away
or
had
a
good
job
that
he
turned
down,
to
make
a
lot
of
money,
willfully
didn't
work,
i
think
then
the
court
can
use
that
as
a
criteria
to
revoke
him,
put
him
in
jail.
because
he's
not
trying
under
the
probation,
under
his
probation,
to
pay
the
fine.
mr.
glenn
zell
no,
it's
the
trial
judge.
mr.
glenn
zell
well
certainly--
mr.
glenn
zell
--certainly.
if
a
man
is
incarcerated,
no
question
about
it;
if
he's
incarcerated,
and
there's
no
evidence
to
put
him
in
jail,
i
think
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
would
lie.
if
a
man
is
put
in
jail
for
no
reason,
whether
it
be
he
has
no
funds
or
for
whatever
reason,
the
judge
thought
he
ought
to
go
to
jail
for
no
reason,
he
just
didn't
like
the
way...
his
hair
was
too
long...
i
had
a
case
like
that
recently,
where
the
judge
revoked
a
man's
probation
because
his
hair
was
too
long.
and
i
think
i
luckily
reversed
that
in
the
state
courts.
but,
a
writ
would
lie...
you
can't
lock
a
man
up
for
no
reason.
mr.
glenn
zell
yes.
mr.
glenn
zell
you
mean
if...
well,
of
course,
in
georgia
if
you
are
convicted
of
first
degree
murder,
you
must
either
get
a
life
or
death
sentence.
i'm
only
talking
about
where
you're
placed
on
probation
or
given
a
some
kind
of
a
suspended
sentence
and
you
use
wealth,
money,
as
the
criteria
to
lock
him
up.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
collect
the
fine?
mr.
glenn
zell
well,
i'm
going
to
take
it
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view,
if
i
may.
i'd
like
to
think
that
trial
judges
will
make
a
determination...
and
i
think
they
are
duty
bound
to
do
this...
whether
a
man
should
go
to
jail
or
not,
regardless
of
money,
regardless
of
other
criteria,
where
in
the
first
instance
should
he
put
him
out
on
the
street,
serve
his
sentence
in
society,
first.
if
he
makes
that
determination
as
he
did
in
this
case,
he
then
decides
what
other
penalties
to
impose
upon
the
defendant,
such
as
a
fine,
community
service,
weekends
in
jail,
what
other...
myriad
amount
of
things
he
could
use
to
so
to
speak
punish
the
man.
well,
not
punish
him,
but
make
him
helpful
to
the
community.
primarily
i'd
consider
community
service
work
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
with
people
who
don't
have
funds.
that
helps
himself,
he
pays
a
penalty,
he
loses
his
recreational
time
on
weekends
and
at
nights,
and
he
also
helps
the
community
by
doing
some
charitable
work.
what
is
the
purpose
of
collecting
this
money?
are
we
saying
the
government
doesn't
have
the
money
to
run
itself?
is
this
a
revenue
producing
measure?
or
what
are
we
furthering
by
saying
you
pay
this
money,
it's
important
in
the
system
of
criminal
justice.
it
isn't
important;
it's
very
unimportant
to
collect
money.
and
the
judges,
trial
judges
should
realize
this
and
i
think
most
of
them
do,
frankly.
and
to
use
money
as
a
criteria
to
put
a
man
in
jail
among
murderers
perhaps...
and
he
sits
in
jail
and
he
says
golly,
my
friend
paid
the
fine
and
i
can't.
and
he
goes
free
because
he
had
money.
i
think
this
is
a
discredit
to
our
system
of
justice
and
it
should
not
be
allowed,
and
i
think
you
should
follow
the
tate
and
williams
case,
this
court
should,
and
did
not
permit
this.
mr.
glenn
zell
free
from
paying
money.
first
of
all,
most
defendants
violate
the
law
because
they
don't
have
money,
obviously;
poverty,
i'm
sure
causes
a
lot
a
crime,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
and
so
most
defendants
are
broke
and
have
no
money.
so
the
imposition
of
fines
on
people
who
are
broke
or
poor
or
have
no
money,
who
have
robbed
or
stolen
to
get
money,
it's
just
inconsistent.
you're
just
catching
yourself
going
around
in
circles.
mr.
glenn
zell
not
at
all.
in
fact,--
mr.
glenn
zell
--that's
correct.
well--
mr.
glenn
zell
--in
fact
i
asked
the
judge,
i
said
look
judge,
reduce
the
fine,
let's
make
it
commensurate.
this
is
a...
failure
to
pay
as
directed,
$500
a
month.
there's
nothing
with
the
judge
saying,
well,
i
misread
this,
i
thought
you
could
pay
$500...
i'll
reduce
it
to
$10.00
a
month,
which
may
be
as
much
to
this
individual
defendant
as
$1,000
a
week
would
be
to
some
other
defendants
who
are
perhaps
involved
in
a
waco
conviction...
organized
crime
conviction.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
sentence
clearly
reads
as
sentence
or
fine
or
both
and
i
don't
think
it's
permissible.
but
again,
it's
to
bar...
based
on
his
wealth,
to
post
the
money,
needed
money.
mr.
glenn
zell
i'm
sure
many
defendants
have
said
that
to
the
trial
judge;
i
certainly
wouldn't
advise
this
court
that
i
was
represented
to
say
that.
all
we're
saying
is
that
after
the
judge
makes
a
determination
that
he
could
be
on
the
street,
that
he
could
be
on
probation,
and
he
has
a
suspended
sentence;
don't
lock
him
up
later
for
not
having
wealth,
not
having
material
goods.
mr.
glenn
zell
i
think--
mr.
glenn
zell
--no,
it
was
conditioned
on
paying
the
money,
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
zell
that's
correct.
it
was
conditioned
on
his
wealth,
on
money,
and
he
could
not...
he
reached
the
other
other
conditions
of
probation,
there
were
about
ten
of
them
in
the
record.
but
the
condition
he
couldn't
reach
was
the
wealth,
the
money
condition,
and
that
shouldn't
be
a
criteria
or
reason
to
lock
a
man
up.
mr.
glenn
zell
who
could
pay
the
money,
could
stay
out
of
jail.
and
if
the
court
determines
that...
that
this
man
paid
the
money
and
stayed
out...
then
that
would
be
a
reverse
discrimination,
then
the
courts
say
well
maybe
they
could
do
some
community
service
work,
put
in
a
lot
of
hours,
some
of
your
time
is
worth
the
minimum
wage,
$3.00
an
hour,
and
work
on
weekends
or
at
nights,
working
this
fine
off
in
the
community.
mr.
glenn
zell
but
certainly
it's
available
to
the
judge
under
georgia
law.
thank
you.
