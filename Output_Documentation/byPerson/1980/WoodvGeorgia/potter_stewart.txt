justice
stewart
and
that
was
a
condition
of
the
probation
was
it
not?
justice
stewart
it's
clear,
isn't
it,
mr.
zell,
that
the
monthly
installment
repayments
were
conditions
of
the
probation?
justice
stewart
it
was
made
clear
that
were
these
repayments
not
made
the
probation
would
be
revoked
and
the
custodial
sentences
would
be
imposed?
justice
stewart
it
was
made
clear
that
it
was
a
condition
of
the
probation?
justice
stewart
well,
would
it
be...
and
it's
not
contended
that
the
prison
sentences
imposed,
which
were
probated
in
this
case
temporarily,
were
excessive,
under
the
law...
they
were
authorized
by
statute?
justice
stewart
would
it
be
permissible
for
a
judge
to
impose
an
authorized
prison
sentence
and
probate
it,
depending
say,
on
the
condition
that
the
defendant,
convicted
defendant
stand
on
his
head
at
twelve
noon
every
day?
and
then
if
it
turned
out
that
the
defendant
couldn't...
didn't
know
how
to
stand
on
his
head
he
would
go
to
prison?
justice
stewart
well
what,
and
let's
say
the
judge
knew
at
the
time
he
imposed
the
probated
sentence,
that
the
defendant,
the
convict
didn't
know
how
to
stand
on
his
head?
if
he
could
have
imposed
the
prison
sentence
from
the
word
go,
couldn't
he
have
imposed
a...
an
impossible
condition?
justice
stewart
otherwise
that
they
should
be,
that's
the
implicit
condition.
justice
stewart
but
you
don't
question,
mr.
zell,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
judge,
so
far
as
the
georgia
statutes
went,
could
have
imposed
the
prison
sentence
right
at
the
outset...
prison
sentences,
without
any
probation
whatsoever?
justice
stewart
well
if
he
made
a
determination
they
should
be
on
probation
if
they
paid
$500
a
month?
justice
stewart
that's
a
condition
of
the
probation
to
be
imposed?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
mr.
zell,
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself,
but
the
determination
that
the
sentencing
judge
made
was
that
he
would
continue
him
on
probation
so
long
as
he
paid
$10.00
per
month.
justice
stewart
it
wasn't
an
unconditional
determination.
justice
stewart
among
other
conditions?
justice
stewart
--and
what
if
the
sentencing
judge
had
known
at
the
time
he
imposed
the...
as
a
condition
of
probation...
that
the
convicted
defendants
repay
$500
a
month,
what
if
he'd
known
at
that
very
moment
that
there
was
no
possibility
at
all
that
the
defendants
could
repay?
justice
stewart
isn't
that
just
the
equivalent--
justice
stewart
--what
if
he
had
been
morally
certain
that
the
defendants
couldn't
meet
one
or
more
of
the
other
conditions
of
probation?
