mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
have
been
developed.
seeing
the
noon
hour
approaching,
i'm
going
to
try
to
concentrate
on
points
that
we
concentrated
on.
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
sought
and...
in
my
view,
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
do,
was
have
the
baby.
it
did
not
want
litigation
about
the
same
complaints,
if
you
will,
and...
the
same
cognizable
claim
or
not...
before
both
the
federal
and
the
state
court.
and
in
so
doing
ignored
its
own
ruling,
in
hodge
v.
mountain
states
telephone
company.
now
hodge,
is
very
interesting,
because
it
causes
me
to
disagree
with
a
great
deal
of
the
authority
cited
by
my
opposition.
hodge
is
a
case
wherein
summary
judgment
was
had
over
both
state
and
pendent
claims,
in
the
district
court,
the
ninth
circuit
in
1977,
reversed
that
saying,
according
to
mine
workers
v.
gibbs
if
there
is
no
substantial
federal
question,
state
claim
as
a
matter
of
comity
belong
in
the
state
courts.
that
california
law
follows
that
is
cited...
is
stated
very
clearly
in
the
case
we
cite
as
merry
v.
coast
community
college,
where
the...
and
i'm
quoting
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
consistently
held
that
where
a
federal
claim
dismissed
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
before
there
has
been
a
substantial
expenditure
of
the
court's
time
or
energy
on
the
case,
proper
exercise
of
discretion
requires
dismissal
of
the
state
claims
without
prejudice
to
plaintiff's
right
to
litigate
them
in
a
proper
state
forum.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
agreed.
mine
workers
v.
gibbs
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
believe
it
should
be,
i
believe
it
was
bad
law
then.
i
believe
that
a
rule,
as
many
commentators
have
stated
and
many
cases
have
said
of
equity
must
be
equitably
applied
as
this
court
said
recently
in
brown
v.
felsen...
that
you
have
to
sparingly
apply
such
a
rule
so
as
to
avoid
shielding
wrongdoing
behind
a
technicality.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
indeed,
it
is
an
equitable
rule.
i
want
to
emphasize
two
facts
with
which
i
disagree
with
my
opposition.
principally
what
was
disposed
of
in
brown
i?
it
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
could
maintain
a
cognizable
claim
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
i
was
in
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction,
they
told
me
go
away,
in
its
entirety.
i
went
to
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
with
my
claims.
merry
v.
coast
community
college,
the
very
recent
california
case,
court
of
appeals
case
on
point,
says
i
did
the
correct
thing.
mine
worker
v.
gibbs
says
i
did
the
correct
thing.
i
was...
there
was
nothing
to
which
to
append
stated
claims
once
we
had
been
directed
to
get
out
of
the
court
of--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--i
don't
believe
there
was
diversity.
one
of
the--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--features
of
the
municipal
court.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
in
a
blur.
there
were
two
issues
that
i
believe
defeat
the
diversity
jurisdiction
in
the
case
at
bar,
to-wit,
brown
ii.
point
number
one:
at
the
time
we
filed
the
action
in
municipal
court,
in
california,
the
jurisdictional
amount
was
$5,000
and
that's
what
we
pleaded
per
claimant.
not
$10,000.
under
younger,
harris
that
cannot
be
aggregated.
moreover,
no
injunction
was
sought,
so
the
jurisdictional
amount,
it
seems
to
me
cannot
be
generated
that
way.
accordingly,
in
my
mind,
and
i've
never
seen
it
actually
adjudicated,
there
was
never
diversity
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
in
my
mind
there
was
not.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
do.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
trying
to
avoid
piecemeal
litigation
that
is
permissible
because
it
didn't
like
it.
it
tried--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--yes
sir.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
no
sir.
by
mine
worker
v.
gibbs--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--but
once
there's
no
federal
nexus
and
once
we
haven't
gone
into...
mine
worker
v.
gibbs
it
seems
to
me
there
was
a
discussion
in
the
beginning
of
the
opinion
where
it
said
even
if
you
were
to
get
into
the
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
cause,
and
the
only
merits
we've
had
heard
are
whether
or
not
we
had
standing
to
maintain
a
cognizable
claim
under
section
4
in
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
believe,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
premises,
the
increments
that
add
up
to
whether
or
not
one
is
entitled
to
res
judicata
in
effect,
against
an
opponent,
is
whether
or
not
some
threshold
bar
has
prevented
an
actual
dispute
or
a
resolution
of
the
substance
of
the
dispute
in
the
case
at
bar,
whether
or
not
certain
activity
took
place
on
the
part
of
the
department
stores
which
caused
injury,
proximately
caused
injury
to
these
people,
these
claimants
in
the
class...
putative
class.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
did,
your
honor,
in
brown
ii.
in
brown
i
there
was
nothing
to
remand.
the
court
sua
sponte
invited
the
motion
from
the
defense
to
dismiss
for
want
of
standing
under
the
clayton
act.
that
motion
was
briefed,
held
under
submission
for
a
long
time.
it
was
granted,
the
actions
were
dismissed
in
their
entirety.
i
read
mine
worker
v.
gibbs,
it
said
when
there
is
nothing
to
append
a
state
claim
to,
you
don't
belong
in
federal
court.
so
we
went
to
the
only
other
available
forum,
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
the
state
courts,
whose
rules
of
res
judicata...
the
facts
at
bar
in
this
merry
v.
coast
community
college
case,
say
we
did
the
right
thing.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
no
sir.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
nor
would
the
ninth
circuit
or
this
court,
i
believe,
under
mine
worker
v.
gibbs.
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
was
trying
to
fashion
an
equitable
remedy
in
a
larger
sense,
was
a
little--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--agreed.
hodge
was
their
law,
hodge
is
what
they
should
have
followed,
hodge
is
what
we
did,
following
gibbs.
if
this
rule
is
undone,
that
allows
someone
who
is
barred
on
a
threshold
bar
from
litigating
the
substance
of
their
dispute
between
the
parties,
you
have
undone
mine
worker
v.
gibbs
and
replete
other
cases--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--that's
correct,
hodge
v.
mountain
states
tel.
and
tel.,
1977.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
yes.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
did
not
plead
the
cartwright
act
claim
in
brown
ii,
but
yes
sir,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
yes.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
correct.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
there
was
no
indictment
in
the
relevant
geographic--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--i
was
told...
i
was
dismissed
for
want
of
standing,
i
didn't
see
any
other
federal
claim--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--no,
not
in
my
case.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
correct.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
when...
my
law
clerk
asked
me,
when
he
saw
the
decision,
what
happened?
i
told
him
i
didn't
lose.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--well,
at
this
point,
the
federal
claim
would
now,
somehow
or
other,
be...
i
would
like
to
be
in
the
state
court.
i
think
my
clients
have
made...
i
know
my
clients,
one
of
them
an
attorney,
has
made
the
election
to
proceed
in
state
court
under
the
state
claims.
we
have,
frankly,
a
district
judge
which
has
shown
no
affection
for
the
cause--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--well
i
believe--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
follow.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
was
asked
a
narrow
question
and
i
tried
to
answer
it
straightforwardly.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
believe
we
would
be
estopped
from
relitigating
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
standing
under
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
and
to
the
extent
more
is
asked,
i'm--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--no
sir.
you're
going
to
run
right
into
the
state
of
california
if
you
rule
that
we
can't
in
this
merry
v.
coast
community
college
case.
and
i
believe
this
is
a
paradigm
case
and
i'm
willing
to
stand
or
fall
on
its
reasoning.
the
california
court
of
appeals.
in
that
case,...
do
i
presume
on
the
patience
of
the
court?
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
it's
not
clear
to
me
to
what--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--that
could
very
well
settle
that.
and
it
could
be
heard
in
the
district
court
if
that
was
their
pleasure.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
believe
it
would
have
the
express
power
to
act
under
mine
worker
v.
gibbs.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
no
sir.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
i
believe
that
the
district
court
would
have
the
option,
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
no.
i
support
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
much
of
its
reasoning;
i
believe
that
it
made
an
unusually
elaborate--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--i
made
a
great
deal
of
its
reasoning.
and
certainly
its
equitable
premises,
i
believe
that
it
made
an
elaborate
ruling
to
try
to
avoid...
to
give
each
side
something.
in
their
case--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--i
said
that
it
was...
clayton
4
cause,
if
any,
is
now
expired,
and
would
be--
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
--cross-petition
in
this
court?
mr.
jerrold
n.
offstein
because
it
was
my
reading
of
the
rules,...
hopefully
an
accurate
one,
that
once
the
case
was
brought
up,
irrespective
of
the
narrow
point,
once
the
entire
file
would
be
brought
forward
the
ultimate
reasoning
of
the
court
and
the
increments
of
its
reasoning,
i've
been
led
to
believe
that
this
court
in
particular
deals
with
substance,
not
form.
thank
you.
