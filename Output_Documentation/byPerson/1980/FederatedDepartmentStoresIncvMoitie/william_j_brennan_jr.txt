justice
jr.
but
none
were
alleged,
i
thought
you
said?
justice
jr.
well,
your
argument
doesn't
depend
on
what
happened
in
the
other
cases
does
it?
justice
jr.
but
mr.
chapman--
justice
jr.
well,
let's
see
now.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
you
more
than
you
asked
for,
then
when
they
reinstated
brown
i
judgment,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
well
tell
me
what
happened...
tell
me
what
happens
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed,
the
judgment
is
affirmed
by
us?
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
go
back
to
the
district
court,
say
sorry,
i
don't
want
you
to
hear
me
on
the
federal
claim?
justice
jr.
just
hear
me
on
the
state
claim?
justice
jr.
well
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
we
affirm?
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
district
court
about
the
reinstated
federal
claim?
justice
jr.
which
you
say
you're
not
entitled
to?
justice
jr.
which
you
just
said
you're
not
entitled
to,
as
i
understood
it.
