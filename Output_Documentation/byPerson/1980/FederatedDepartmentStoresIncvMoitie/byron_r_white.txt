justice
white
did
the
brown
case
start
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
did
the
case
start
in
the
state
court,
brown?
justice
white
and
how
were
they
removed?
justice
white
a
federal
question.
justice
white
so
even
if
there
were
only
state
claims
stated
in
those
cases
that
started
in
the
state
court,
they
could
have
been
removed?
justice
white
and
now
brown
has
stated
both
federal
and
state
grounds?
justice
white
federal,
yes.
and
then
in
brown
ii,
state?
justice
white
arising
out
of
the
same
facts?
justice
white
brown
ii
was
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
and
then
removed?
justice
white
on
the
grounds
of
diversity?
justice
white
now
why
do
you...
what's
the
basis
for
your
argument
that
the
state
grounds
alleged
in
brown
ii
are
barred
by
res
judicata?
because
they
weren't
stated
when
they
were
first
filed
in
the
federal
court,
is
that
it?
justice
white
now,
do
you
have
a
case
that,
right
on,
that
says
if
you
file
in
the
federal
court
and
you
state
only
federal
cause
of
action,
and
you
lose,
and
then
you
file
in
federal
court
a...
based
on
diversity,
a
state
cause
of
action
based
on
the
same
facts,
that
res
judicata
bars
the
second
suit.
justice
white
what
if
brown
ii
had
stayed
in
the
state
courts
and
never
been
removed,
and
stated
only
a
state
cause
of
action,
could
the
state
court
have...
you
would
have
asserted
res
judicata
there
too?
justice
white
but
you
might
have
lost.
and
would
the
state
court
be
entitled
to,
not
to
try
those
claims
and
reject
the
res
judicata
claim?
justice
white
well,
what
if
california
didn't?
and
they
went
ahead
and
tried
out
their
fraud
claim?
now
if
california
would
permit
that
to
go
ahead,
shouldn't
the
federal
court
permit
it
to
go
ahead
if
the
case
is
removed,
on
diversity
grounds?
justice
white
do
you
think
then
that
you
can
get
an
injunction
from
the
federal
court
if...
you
should
have
been
able
to
enjoin
the
filing
of
brown
ii
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
well
didn't
moitie,
when
it
started
in
the
state
courts
state
only
a
state
law?
justice
white
that's
all
it
ever
had
in
it?
justice
white
is
the
moitie
case
here?
or
not?
justice
white
well
mr.
chapman,
suppose
in
justice
steven's
example,
the
two
cases
being
filed
simultaneously
and
the
federal
case
finishing
first.
suppose
the
state...
you
had
then
gone
to
the
state
court
and
said
res
judicata
and
the
state
court
said,
awfully
sorry,
but
we
don't
apply
res
judicata
that
way
in
this
state.
and
they
tried
the
case
and
entered
judgment
against
federated,
and
the
case
then
came
up
here.
you
wouldn't
claim
that
california
was
constitutionally
disentitled,
would
you?
justice
white
well
why
shouldn't
the
rule
in
the
federal
court,
in
brown,
which
was
filed
in
the
state
and
then
removed,
why
shouldn't
the
state
rule
apply,
of
res
judicata
apply?
justice
white
when
it's
removed
on
the
basis
of
diversity?
justice
white
but
why
shouldn't
the
ninth
circuit
though
focus
on
what
the
state
law
is?
justice
white
well...
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that.
justice
white
mr.
chapman,
are
you
saying
that...
i
guess
you
are,
that
if
you
file
a
federal
cause
of
action
in
federal
court,
a
federal
question
case,
if
out
of
those
facts
you
have
a
pendent
state
claim
you
must
file
it.
not
only
does
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
over
these
pendent
claims,
but
it
has...
would
have
absolutely
no
discretion
to
refuse
to
decide
the
pendent
claims.
justice
white
well
wasn't
brown,
when
it
was
originally
filed
in
the
state...
in
the
federal
court,
weren't
the
state
claims
asserted
only
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
because
of
pendent
jurisdiction?
or
what
was
it?
justice
white
wouldn't
you...
on
this
very
argument,
wouldn't
you
make
a
difference
between
claims
that
are
just
pendent
to
a
federal
claim
or
that
are
arguably
pendent,
and
claims
that
could
be
brought
originally
in
the
federal
court
based
on
diversity?
because
then,
these
diversity
claims
would
independently
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and...
and
there
was
diversity
here.
justice
white
because
there
is
diversity.
justice
white
but
what
if
the
question
is
did
the
court
of
appeals...
if
the
question
is,
did
the
court
of
appeals
properly
reinstate
these
judgments.
that's...
right?
justice
white
that
is
the
question,
you
say
they
should
not
have
reinstated
either
the
state
or
the
federal
claims?
justice
white
well
how
was
brown
removed,
brown
ii
removed,
eventually,
on
federal
question?
justice
white
well
there
wasn't
federal
question
then,
either?
justice
white
so
there
never...
the
removal
was
wholly
improper
you
think?
justice
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
otherwise.
justice
white
well
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
on
the...
suppose
we
think
it's
important
to
know
whether
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction
and
we
disagree
with
you.
suppose
we
concluded
yes
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction
over
the
state
law
claims
and
that
they
could
have
been
filed
originally
with
the
federal
claim
in
brown
i?
justice
white
would
that
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
white
that's
just
a
pendent
case.
justice
white
so
then,
you
think
california
courts
would
not
have
sustained
a
plea
of
res
judicata?
justice
white
on
these
facts?
justice
white
and
that
he
arrived
at
that
result
by
the
wrong
way,
wrong--
justice
white
well
you,
if
you
really
mean
what
you
say,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
conceding...
if
you
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
arrived
at
the
right
result
for
the
wrong
reason,
you
really
are...
aren't
you
really
suggesting
or
really
conceding
that
the
reinstatement
of
the
federal
claim
is
wrong?
justice
white
well
did
you
state
a
federal
claim
in
the
state
courts
in
brown
ii?
justice
white
solely
state?
justice
white
yes,
you
did,
i
think.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
but
you're
not...
you
are
not
barred
from
trying
your
state
claim?
justice
white
but
if...
i
don't
know...
what
do
you
suppose
the
district
court
will
do
if
it
were
determined,
for
example,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
reinstating
the
federal
claim
and
that
only
the
state
claims
are
there?
justice
white
well
i'm
saying
if
we
said
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
in
reinstating
the
federal
claim.
