justice
stewart
well
in
any
event,
there's
only
one
issue
before
us,
is
there
not?
justice
stewart
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case?
justice
stewart
only
one
question
was
raised
in
the
certiorari
petition,
only
one
question
is
addressed
in
your
original
brief--
justice
stewart
--and
while
the
respondent's
brief
canvasses
the
issues
that
my
brothers
have
asked
you
about,
that's
not
before
us
now,
is
it?
justice
stewart
well
it's
hardly
for
the
district
court
to
determine
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
is
it?
