mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
are
here
to
ask
the
court
to
reverse
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
we
believe
is
not
only
contrary
to
established
principles
but
creates
a
very
serious
practical
impediment
on
the
ability
of
district
courts
to
coordinate
and
control
multi-party
complex
litigations.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
out
back
on
the
normal
rule
of
finality
of
judgments
in
the
context
of
multiple-party,
multiple
action
litigation
which
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
should
have
been
done.
that
is,
in
these
classes
of
cases
there
is
more
rather
than
less
need
for
adherence
to
res
judicata
and
the
rule
of
finality.
we
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
to
describe
briefly
the
background
of
this
case
and
how
it
comes
to
this
court.
and
then
to
present
what
we
consider
the
principal
reasons
why
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
contrary
to
established
principles
of
res
judicata
and
out
of
step
with
the
salutary
trends
in
improving
the
abilities
of
the
district
court
to
control
and
coordinate
complex
cases.
the
present
case.
your
honor,
started
the
same
way
as
have
hundreds
of
class
action
cases
in
the
federal
court.
it's
a
class
action
for
treble
damages
and
attorneys
fees
and
other
relief,
following
on
the
heels
of
a
federal
government
action.
in
april
of
1976,
the
federal
government
obtained
a
misdemeanor
indictment
against
petitioners
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
charging
that
the
petitioners
had
agreed
on
the
prices
of
women's
clothings
in
their
stores
in
northern
california.
shortly
thereafter,
a
multiplicity
of
private
class
actions
were
filed;
there
were
seven
in
all,
two
of
those
were
filed
by
the
same
counsel.
one
of
the
actions,
which
was
entitled
moitie
v.
federated
and
saks
has
been
voluntarily
dismissed
by
the
plaintiffs,
and
that
action
is
not
before
this
court.
the
other
action
is
the
brown
case,
which
is
the
only
case
that
is
before
the
court
this
morning.
the
complaint
in
the
brown
case,
as
i
say,
was
largely
patterned
on
the
government's
pleadings.
it
alleged
that
the
petitioners
had
agreed
to
charge
certain
prices
in
their
stores
on
women's
clothing
and
that
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class
members
that
were
purportedly
represented
had
been
injured
by
being
overcharged
on
those
purchases.
the
one
difference
was
that
unlike
the
government
action
and
the
other
six
class
actions,
the
brown
case
alleged
that
the
violations
took
place
in
southern
california,
rather
than
in
northern
california.
now,
the
cases
proceeded
in
the
district
court
before
a...
they
were
coordinated
before
a
single
judge
and
in
july
of
1976,
the
petitioners
moved
to
dismiss
all
seven
cases
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
under
rule
12(b)(6).
there
was
extensive
briefing
on
the
motion,
in
fact,
the
district
court
set
aside
one
entire
day
for
oral
argument.
and
in
january
of
1977,
the
district
court
dismissed
all
seven
cases.
there
were
several
issues
considered,
but
the
primary
ground
that
was
relied
upon
in
the
district
court's
dismissal
was
that
the
plaintiffs
and
class
members
as
retail
purchasers
did
not
allege
an
injury
to
their
business
or
property
which
would
entitle
them
to
treble
damage
recovery
under
the
clayton
act,
section
4.
the
parties
in
five
of
the
other
cases
appealed,
and
we've
referred
to
these
for
convenience
in
our
brief,
as
the
weinberg
cases.
the
weinberg
cases
all
took
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
their
actions
to
the
ninth
circuit.
however,
brown
deliberately
chose
to
break
away
from
the
other
cases
at
this
point,
and
did
not
appeal.
when
the
time
for
appeal
had
expired,
the
respondent
brown
filed
a
new
action
in
the
municipal
court
in
palo
alto-mountain
view
judicial
district,
which
was
in
all
material
respects
absolutely
identical
to
the
prior
case.
and
we've
referred
to
these
again,
for
convenience,
the
prior
dismissed
action
as
brown
i;
the
second
action,
which
is
the
action
now
before
this
court
as
brown
ii.
as
i
say,
brown
i
and
brown
ii
were
essentially
identical,
the
same
parties
were
involved,
were
alleged.
there
were
the
same
descriptions
of
trade
and
commerce,
exactly
the
same
offenses
charged,
the
same
alleged
effects
of
the
offenses
were
charged,
the
same
time
period
was
covered,
the
period
up
to
april,
1974.
the
same
geographic
area
was
covered
in
both
complaints.
they
were
the
exact
verbatim
allegations
of
fraudulent
concealment
and
verbatim
the
same
allegations
of
the
alleged
injury.
the
only
difference
which
we
submit,
and
we
believe
the...
both
courts
below
perceived
as
cosmetic
differences...
was
that
the
word
antitrust
was
not
mentioned
in
the
brown
ii
complaint.
instead,
the
complaint
was
framed
in
terms
of
four
theories
under
california
law:
fraud
and
deceit,
unfair
business
practices,
civil
conspiracy
and
restitution.
but
there
has
never
been
any
question
at
any
time
in
this
case
that
the
gravamen
of
the
two
complaints,
brown
i
and
brown
ii,
the
basic
thrust
and
core
of
both
complaints
is
absolutely
identical.
they
charge
that
the
petitioners
agreed
on
their
prices
of
women's
clothing
prior
to
april,
1974,
in
southern
california
and
that
that
agreement
had
the
effect
of
causing
the--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--pardon
me?
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
brown
case
did
not
start
in
the
state
court,
mr.
justice
white.
the
companion
moitie
case
as
had
one
of
the
other
seven
cases
named
musser,
had
originally
been
filed
in
the
state
court--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--they
were
removed
on
the
basis
of
a
federal
question--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--and
diversity
of
citizenship.
there
is
complete
diversity
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
your
honor.
in
brown
i,
the
factual
allegation
of
the
transactions
and
offenses
were
exactly
identical
to
brown
ii.
but
there
was
only
one
legal
theory
mentioned
in
brown
i,
and
that
was
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
brown
ii
mentioned
fraud
and
deceit,
unjust...
restitution,
and--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--out
of
the
same
facts
that
were
stated
in
identical
fashion;
they
were
verbatim
copies
of
the...
brown
ii
were
the
verbatim
copies--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--brown
ii
was
originally
filed
in
the
state
court--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--and
then
it
was
removed.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
it
was
removed
on
grounds
of
diversity,
of
federal
questions,
and
then
there
was
an
additional
federal
question...
ground...
that
the...
the
issue
of
the
scope
and
effect
of
the
first
judgment
itself
raised
the
federal
question.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
it's
the
standard
principle
of
res
judicata,
and
i
should
say,
your
honor,
that
the...
both
courts
below
held...
we
submit,
correctly...
that
if
brown
had
been
the
only
case
that
followed
on
the
government
indictment,
had
it
stood
below,
the
standard
principles
of
res
judicata
would
apply.
and
that
can
be
stated
and
has
been
stated
in
numerous
cases
in
this
court,
that
a
final
judgment...
it
was
a
final
judgment
in
brown
i...
precludes
the
refiling
of
the
same
claim
on
matters
that
were
raised
or
could
have
been
raised
in
the
initial
case.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
specific
suits
in
the
antitrust
field
which
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
most
recently,
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
nash
county
board
of
education,
that
was
a
case
which
came
up
the
opposite
way.
the
initial
case
was
filed
in
state
court,
alleging
only
state
law
antitrust
grounds.
and
when
that
suit
was
concluded,
another
party
actually,
it
was
the
privy
of
the
first
party
filed
in
the
federal
court--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--yes,
res
judicata--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
our
understanding,
and
we
have
never
seen
anything
contrary
to
this
in
any
of
the
briefing
or
research
in
this
case,
that
the
same
standards
as
to
res
judicata
which
are
applied
in
the
federal
court
are
also
applied
in
california.
we
believe
that
the
state
court--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--the
federal
court
had
a
special
interest
in
connection
with
brown
ii
in
determining
and
avoiding
circumvention
of
its
initial
judgment
in
brown
i.
the
federal
court
had
already...
there
had
been
active
engagement
in
litigation
in
the
federal
court;
it
had
devoted
time
and
attention
to
these
matters.
indeed,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
there
were
state
claims
that
were
before
the
federal
court
at
the
same
time
that
brown
i
was
dismissed.
and
it
has...
consideration
of
both
federal
and
state
claims.
once
the
federal
court
enters
a
judgment,
this
is
really
the
heart
of
our
case.
mr.
justice
white,
the
rule
of
res
judicata
comes
into
play.
there
are
crucial
considerations
in
terms
of
avoiding
vexatious
and
multiple
litigation,
conserving
judicial
resources
and
promoting
respect
for
judgment,
that
come
into
play
when
that
final
judgment
is
entered...
which
was
entered
in
brown
i.
it
is
certainly,
and
we
considered
it
so,
and
the
district
court
considered
it
so,
very
much
in
the
interest
of
the
district
court
to
protect
its
own
judgment
and
to
determine
the
scope
of
that
judgment.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
your
honor.
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
woods
petroleum,
which
was
exactly
that,
where
the
fifth
circuit
held
an
injunction
by
the
district
court
against
a
state
proceeding
based
on
an
alleged
state
theory
which
was
not
but
could
have
been
alleged
as
a
pendent
claim
in
a
prior
federal
case.
and
the
fifth
circuit,
in
woods,
adopted
the
same
rationale
that
i've
just
spoken
of...
that
once
there's
a
final
judgment
in
a
federal
court,
the
federal
court
does
have
the
right
to
protect
that
judgment.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
no,
your
honor,
by
no
means.
i
think
that
the
procedural
rules
that
govern
the
administration
and
management
of
cases
within
the
federal
courts
are
determined
by
federal
law,
and
that
the...
for
example,
the
30-day,
or
whatever
period
that's
established
in
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure...
by
statute
would
cover
federal
cases...
even
though
on
substantive
law
matters,
where
a
case
is
in
federal
court
on
diversity
jurisdiction
the
federal
court
would
be
bound
by
state
law.
but
certainly
not
on
these
procedural
matters.
they
say
that
there's
a...
the...
the
timing
and
manner
in
which
the
supposed
state
theories
were
raised
in
brown
ii,
are
very
troublesome.
they...
all
of
these
theories
could
have
been,
and
there's
no
question
about
it,
could
have
been
asserted
at
the
same
time
that
brown
i
is
filed,
and
this
is
another
basis
thrust
of
the...
this
doctrine
against
splitting
a
cause
of
action
in
res
judicata...
if
you
bring
a
case
you
should
bring
forth
all
your
theories
at
one
time.
the
complaint
could
have
alleged
state
law
theories;
in
fact,
the
same
counsel
had
filed
a
complaint
contemporaneously
with
brown
i,
the
moitie
case,
which
did
allege
state
law
theories.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
correct.
and
which,
i'm
saying
with
respect
to
brown
i,
your
honor,
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
brown
i--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--no,
moitie
has
been
voluntarily
dismissed.
let
me
say,
your
honor,
that
when
the
defendants
argued
for...
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
before
the
district
court,
and
i
am
again
talking
about
the
first
cases,
brown
i,
moitie
i,
the
weinberg
seven
cases...
we
were
faced
with
some
complaints
that
alleged
sherman
act
violations,
other
complaints
that
alleged
cartwright
act,
california
law
violations.
and
we
argued
that
the
determining
rule,
that
is,
the
standard
for
determining
business
or
property,
was
the
same
under
federal
law
as
under
california
law.
so
those
issues
were
presented
to
the
district
court
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
dismissed
brown
i
and
dismissed
moitie
i.
and
it
disposed
of
all
seven
cases
including
the
case
before
this
court,
in
its
entirety.
the
crucial
difference
was
that
in
brown,
which
is
the
only
case
before
this
court,
no
appeal
was
taken;
instead,
an
attempt
was
made
to
refile,
with
different
theories,
all
of
which
could
have
been
brought
before
the
district
court,
they
could
have
been
in
the
original
complaint
but
they
were
not.
there
could
have
been
an
argument
presented
to
the
district
court
in
the
context
i've
just
mentioned
that
even
if
you
hold
that
under
federal
law
retail
purchasers
cannot,
do
not
meet
the
business
or
property
standard...
that
these
plaintiffs
could
go
forward
under
state
law,
that
could
have
been
done.
there
could
have
been
a
motion
to
amend
the
complaint;
the
federal
rules
are
very
liberal.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes,
that's
correct.
that
was
exactly
what
happened
in
the
fifth
circuit
woods
case,
which
was
an
injunction
action.
there
were...
the
state
case
that
was
involved
there
had
been
filed
simultaneously
in
fact,
perhaps
even
prior...
but
any
event,
it
was
proceeding
simultaneously
with
the
federal
case.
the
federal
case
went
to
judgment
first.
and
that's
really
the
key
factor
of
the
res
judicata...
application
of
res
judicata,
that
once
there's
a
judgment,
it
resolves
the
matter.
unless
the
judgment
is
directly
attacked
on
appeal,
as
the
weinberg
plaintiff
did--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
correct.
and
the
district
court
granted
the
motion,
the
matter
then
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
while
brown
ii
was
pending...
after
the
dismissal
of
brown
ii,
the
plaintiff
did
appeal
from
that
judgment--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--it's
not
a
constitutional
question,
no,
that's
not
part
of
our--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--let
me
make
clear,
your
honor,
that
the--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--every
indication
in
every
case
that
was
ever
referred
to
in
the
lower
courts
when
this
matter
was
briefed
before
the
lower
courts...
it
wasn't
briefed
extensively
here,
because
it
wasn't
the
issue
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--no,
your
honor.
the
fact
is,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
there
is
any
difference
whatsoever
between
the
california
law
and
federal
law
on
res
judicata.
if
i
may--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--if
i
may
address
specifically
what
the
ninth
circuit
did?
the
ninth
circuit
stated
that
if
there
had
only
been
the
brown
case,
that
the
normal
standards
of
res
judicata...
and
it
didn't
purport
to
distinguish
between
federal
or
state
law
would
apply
and
that
the
failure
to
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
brown
i
would
bar
the
refiling
of
brown
ii.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
precisely.
and
the
important
element
here
is
that
this
was
a
federal
judgment
and
the
scope
of
the
federal
judgment
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
this
court
had
held
that
in
stoll
v.
gottlieb
and
other
cases.
but
the
crucial
distinction
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
as
follows:
the
court
of
appeals
said
again,
if
this
was
only
one
case,
we
would
have
no
trouble
applying
res
judicata.
but
it
noted
that
the
weinberg
cases,
the
other
five
federal
cases
which
were
dismissed
at
the
same
time
as
brown
i,
did
appeal.
they
followed
the
orderly
course
and
took
their
case
up
to
the
ninth
circuit.
subsequently,
this
court,
in
reiter
v.
sonotone,
held
that
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
retail
purchasers
do
state
a
claim
of
injury
to
their
business
or
property
and
so
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
weinberg
cases
were
reversed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
sent
back
to
the
district
court.
a
few
months
later,
brown
ii
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
one
ground
and
one
ground
only,
and
that
is
that
because
the
other
plaintiffs
in
other
separately
filed
independent
actions,
the
weinberg
cases,
did
appeal
and
did
obtain
a
reversal
in
their
case
that
even
though
plaintiff
brown
had
suffered
a
final
judgment,
and
not
attempted
to
appeal
his
case,
but
in
fact
attempted
to
refile
in
another
litigation,
that
brown
is
entitled
to
have
his
action
reinstated
because
of
the
benefit
of
the
appeal
by
the
other
parties.
and
that
was
the
issue
and
the
only
issue
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--oh
quite
the
contrary,
quite
the
contrary.
the
rule
is
well
stated
in
cases
in
this
court,
and
accepted
in
the
restatement,
again,
it's
a
question
of
not
splitting
your
cause
of
action
and
bringing
all
your
cases
at
one
time.
the
key
of
pendent
jurisdiction
is
discretion.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
the
state
claims
could
have
been
based
on
diversity
or
pendent
jurisdiction;
there
was
no
adjudication
of
that
point.
the
state
claims
were
permissible
there
because
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
in
brown
there
were
none
alleged.
in
five
of
the
other
cases,
in
two
of
the
other
cases
they
were
alleged.
but
the
key,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say
this,
is
that--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--that's
exactly
the
point.
but
the
ninth
circuit
decision
depends
solely
on
what
happened
to
the
other
cases,
and
nothing
else.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--solely
that
the
only
reason
why
res
judicata
should
be
relieved
in
this
case
was
that
the
other
cases
were
reversed
on
appeal.
and
we
submit
that
that
creates
a
premium
for
overriding
the
finality
of
judgment
in
just
the
worst
kind
of
cases
where
you
have
a
piling-on
of
multiple
actions
in
the
wake
of
a
government
antitrust
case,
which
is
very
typical.
the
only
reason
that
this
case
is
here
is
because
other
parties
in
other
cases
did
appeal
and
did
obtain
a
reversal.
and
we
believe
that
to
allow
relief
from
the
finality
of
judgments
because
of
actions
taken
by
other
parties
would
only
impair
the
ability
of
the
district
courts
to
coordinate
and
control
complex
multi-party
class
actions.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
well
i
would
answer
in
two
ways.
first,
that
the...
the
answer
is
no,
that
is
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
the
ninth
circuit
understood--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--the
ninth
circuit
understood
that
the
application
of
res
judicata
would
bar
the
entire
claim
and
the
term
claim
is
not...
we're
not
dealing
with
forms
of
actions,
it's
the
entire
collection
of
rights
and
any
legal
theories
that
arise
out
of
this
transaction.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
normally
federal
or
state
claims
would
be
barred
if
this
were
the
only
case.
but
it
relieved
brown
of
res
judicata,
which
opened
up
the
entire
claim
because
of
what
happened
in
the
other
cases.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
may
i
say,
there's
no
question
but
that
california
law
and
federal
law
are
absolutely
identical
on
what
is
meant
by
res
judicata.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
refused
to
follow
any
of
the
standards
of
res
judicata
by
virtue
of
one
fact
and
one
fact
alone,
namely
that
the
other
cases,
the
weinberg
cases,
were
reversed
on
appeal.
so
there
was
no
distinction
between,
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
law
of
california
and--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--the
district
court
could
have
had
discretion
under
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
to
pull
out
any--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
the
law
against
splitting
a
cause
of
action
makes
it
clear
that
when
plaintiffs
bring
their
actions
they
cannot
hold
back
theories
in
their
back
pockets
and
try
out...
try
their
luck
with
the
federal
claim.
if
that
doesn't
work,
then
they
have
something
else
to
fall,
another
line
to
fall
back
on
in
state
courts.
and
the
cases
that
we
cite
on
the
standard
of
splitting
a
cause
of
action
all
go
to
that.
the
district
court
does
have
discretion,
but
he
must
not
be
deprived
of
his
opportunity
to
exercise
discretion
by
not
having
the
cases
brought
forward.
and
i
would
also
say
that
the
district
court
did
know,
as
counsel
concedes
in
his
brief,
that
there
was
at
least
a
potentiality
of
state
cases
at
the
time
that
brown
i
was
dismissed
because
moitie--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--there
was
diversity...
i
think,
the
important
point,
your
honor,
is
this.
if
you
don't
have
to,
and
we
believe
in
this
case
that
no
issue
with
respect
to
pendent
jurisdiction
is
before
this
court--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--because
there
is
diversity,
but
the
basic
rule
against
splitting
a
cause
of
action
would
apply
no
matter
how
the
case
got
into
federal
court.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
yes
sir.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
that...
you
are
precisely
correct.
the
question
is
to
whether
there
is
an
exception
from
res
judicata
in
multiple-party,
multiple-action
litigation
where--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--the
court
of
appeals...
the
question--
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
--the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
properly
reversed
the
dismissal
for
res
judicata.
the
grounds,
which
were
stated
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
that
res
judicata
would
apply
but
for
the
action
in
the
other
multiple
cases.
and
we
say,
your
honor,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
basis,
indeed,
respondent
presents
no
basis
for
the
novel
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
few
moments
i
have
for
my
response.
mr.
jerome
i.
chapman
i
would
like,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
make
two
brief
points.
first,
the
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
petition
is
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
that
in
multiple-party
actions,
the
appeal
by
certain
parties
relieves
the
party
who
didn't
appeal
from
the
normal
application
of
res
judicata.
it's
our
submission,
for
the
reasons
in
our
briefs,
that
this
would
create
a
tremendous
hardship
and
burden
in
the
administration
of
complex,
multiple-party
class
actions.
the
respondent's
submission,
your
honor,
would,
if
accepted,
create
a
burden
in
all
cases,
because
he
is
arguing
in
favor
of
piecemeal
litigation,
that
you
don't
have
to
bring
forward
once
you
come
into
a
federal
court,
or
whatever
court
with
your
first
complaint,
you
don't
have
to
bring
forward
all
your
theories,
you
don't
have
to
bring
forward
all
of
your
rights
for
recovery,
you
don't
have
to
give
the
district
court
discretion
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
handle
all
the
cases
at
one
time.
so
we
believe
that
the
issue
presented
by
respondents
is
not
properly
here,
and
we
urge
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
reinstatement
of
the
district
court's
decision.
