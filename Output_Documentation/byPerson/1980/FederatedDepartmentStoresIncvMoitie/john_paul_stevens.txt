justice
stevens
mr.
chapman,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
brown
had
simultaneously
filed
his
state
law
theories
in
the
california
court,
and
his
federal
theories
in
the
federal
court.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
first
brown
i
was
simply
the
federal
theory,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
the
federal
case...
they
both
progressed
with
discovery
and
all
the
rest,
and
the
federal
case
had
gone
to
judgment
first.
and
you
had
prevailed,
either
on
the
legal
theory
that
the
plaintiffs
weren't...
didn't
have
standing,
or
that
there
was
no
federal
violation
of
some
kind,
would
you
then
have
been
entitled
to
dismissal
of
the
state
case;
that's
your
basic
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
when
the
brown
ii
complaint
was
filed,
you
did
not
in
the
state
court
move
to
dismiss
on
res
judicata
grounds,
you
removed?
justice
stevens
and
then
after
you
removed,
you
filed
a
res
judicata
motion?
justice
stevens
--mr.
chapman,
let
me
interrupt
you
again,
because
there's
a
point
of
the
precise
way
in
which
litigation...
precise
posture
of
litigation
i'd
like
to
clarify.
under
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
is
now
free
to
try
both
the
federal
claim
and
the
state
claim,
do
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
stevens
and
your
primary
argument
is
they
are
wrong
in
reinstating
the
federal
claim
on
the
basis
of
the
five
other...
reversal
of
the
five
other
cases.
but
is
it
not
true
that
there
is
an
entirely
separate
legal
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
claim
survived,
and
isn't
that
problem
one
we
must
answer
by
knowing
how
california
would
interpret
its
doctrine
of
res
judicata?
justice
stevens
you
just
told
me
they
are
both
still
standing,
both
the
state
and
federal
claims
are
alive
now.
justice
stevens
well
in
that--
justice
stevens
--well
yes,
but
if
in
brown
i...
there'd
never
been
any
appeals...
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
complaint
saying
well
i
don't
know
anything
about
california
law,
but
i
know
you're
not
a
plaintiff
qualified
to
sue
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act;
file
any
state
law
claims
you
want
someplace
else.
you
wouldn't
say
that
you
would
be
barred
from
going
to
the
state
court,
i'm
quite
sure?
justice
stevens
but
there
were
no
state
claims
asserted,
so
all
he
could
do
on
the
basis
of
what
had
been
filed
before
him,
is
say
well
i
don't
think
you
are
a
proper
plaintiff
under
section
4.
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
that's
true,
i
take
it
under
the
cartwright
act
you
get
treble
damages,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
well
you
would...
we
just
have
a
common
law
claim,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
stevens
so
that
means
basically,
you're
asking
for
single
damages
in
this?
justice
stevens
and
also
you
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
prima
facie...
well
what
happened
in
the
government
case?
justice
stevens
i
see.
the
california
court
wouldn't
have...
brown
ii,
when
you
filed
in
the
state
court,
did
you
state
your
federal
claim
too,
or
was
it
all
state?
justice
stevens
perhaps
this
is
a
silly
question,
but
you're
not
going
back
to
the
state
court,
you're
going
to
confine
yourself
to
the
state
claims,
but
you're
in
the
federal
court
to
stay,
aren't
you?
justice
stevens
there
was
a
motion
to
remand
that
was
denied.
didn't
that
settle
where
the
case
will
be
tried?
