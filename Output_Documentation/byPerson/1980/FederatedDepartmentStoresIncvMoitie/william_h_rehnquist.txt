justice
rehnquist
well
mr.
chapman,
supposing
that
in
federal
court
you
have
30
days
to
file
your
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
in
the
california
system
you
have
120
days
to
file
your
notice
of
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
the
superior
court;
do
you
think
the
principles
of
angel
v.
bullington
and
cases
such
as
that
would
require
the
federal
court
to
adopt
the
120-day
principle
of
california,
rather
than
its
own
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure?
justice
rehnquist
well
both
the
federal
courts
by
statute
and
the
state
courts
by
the
constitution
are
bound
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
are
they
not?
justice
rehnquist
well
mr.
offstein,
i
take
it
you
would
concede
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
bound
by
holdings
of
this
court
in
matters
of
federal
law?
justice
rehnquist
i
notice
in
your
brief
you
give
rather
short
shrift
to
the
case
of
reed
v.
allen,
which
was
decided
in
1932,
on
page
8,
you
cited,
simply
saying
that
professor
moore
has
criticized
it
in
his
treatise.
do
you
want
us
to
overrule
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
that
would
be
a
case-by-case
analysis.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
could
have
presented
your
state
claims
originally
in
the
federal
court,
not
just
as
pendent
jurisdiction,
but
as...
on
diversity
grounds?
justice
rehnquist
but
in
angel
v.
bullington,
the
court
says
the
"merits"
of
a
claim
are
disposed
of
when
it
is
refused
enforcement.
i
take
that
to
mean
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
go
through
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
f
if
it
dismisses
it
for
some
reason...
and
judgment
for
the
defendant.
justice
rehnquist
--hodge
is
a
ninth
circuit
case?
