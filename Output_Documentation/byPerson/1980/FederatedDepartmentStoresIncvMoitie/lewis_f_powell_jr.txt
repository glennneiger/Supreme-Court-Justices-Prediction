justice
jr.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
you
are
no
longer
supporting
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
not
its
reasoning?
justice
jr.
it
ruled
primarily
on
equitable
grounds,
as
it
said,
but
you
now
go...
you
now
go
back
to
the
federal
court,
and
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
thought
that
was
in
error?
justice
jr.
if
you
thought
it
was
in
error,
why
didn't
you
file
a
cross-claim?
justice
jr.
cross-petition.
