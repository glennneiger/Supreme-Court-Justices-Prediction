justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
different
parties
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
the
police
officers
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
and
argue
in
good
faith
and
so
forth?
that
could
be
precluded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
litigate,
but
could
he
get
summary
judgment?
i
think
that
was
what
justice
white
was
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
actually,
isn't
that
issue
here
because
isn't
it
true
that
the
missouri
court
did
suppress
evidence
found
in
the
drawer
and
in
a
tire?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
suppose
they
have
therefore
decided
as
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel
that
to
that
extent
there
was
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
have
a
state
court
adjudication
that
there
was
some
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
officer
who
opened
the
drawer
and
looked
in
the
tires
is
not
a
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
really
not
relevant
but
i
have
some
problems
with
your
damage
theory
that
you're
going
to,
that
they're
going
to
wrestle
with
if
they
win;
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
trying
to
understand
if
it
was
not
suppressed,
if
they...
i
would
hate
to
be
the
trial
judge
trying
to
decide
how
to
apportion,
how
to
award
damages
if
you
ultimately
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fitzgibbon,
assuming
that
the
defendant
suppressed
the
evidence
in
a
state
court
proceeding
and
then
he
was
indicted
on
a
similar
charge
brought
in
the
federal
court,
would
he
be
able
to
plead
in
the
federal
court
collateral
estoppel
and
prevent
the
federal
prosecutor
from
using
the
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes;
assume
a
full
and
fair
hearing
before
the
state
tribunal
and
the
state
court
suppressed
it.
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
would
be
binding
in
a
subsequent
related
federal
prosecution
raising
somewhat
similar
issues
in
which
the
same
evidence
was
required--
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
which
your
question
involved
the
same
search;
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
we're
really
not
talking
about
the
construction
of
1983,
because
if
you
take
the
position
that
it
would
apply
in
a
federal
criminal
prosecution,
it's
a
somewhat
broader
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
saying
it's
wrong,
but
it's
not
just
construction
of
1983,
but
it's
some
doctrine
that
would
apply
in
other
areas
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shank,
i'm
not
clear
on
one
thing.
you
argue
that
the
collateral
estoppel
defense
does
not
apply
in
the
1983
action
for
the
reason
that
a
federal
forum
must
be
available
to
try
these
issues.
now,
would
that
reasoning
apply
if
you
brought
a
1983
action
in
the
state
court,
which,
as
one
of
my
colleagues
suggested,
you
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
your
reason
for
asserting
the
need
for
disregarding
the
defense
would
not
apply
if
you
elected
to
sue
in
the
state
court?
