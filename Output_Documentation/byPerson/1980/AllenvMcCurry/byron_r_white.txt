justice
white
couldn't
that
issue
have
been
taken
to
the
missouri
supreme
court?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
that
was
remanded
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
the
state
court
finding
had
been
the
other
way
and
that
the
evidence
was
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
this
suit
were
brought
against
these
particular
police
officers
and
the
plaintiff
claimed
that
the
issue
had
been
concluded
in
the
criminal
trial
and
he
needn't
present
any
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
police
officers
can
use
this
judgment
in
the
criminal
case
defensively?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
plaintiff
could
use
a
contrary
judgment
offensively?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
in
the
criminal
trial
it
was
predetermined
there
was
not
probable
cause.
would
that
issue
be
open
in
a
1983
suit?
justice
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
have
to
do
today
is
to
win
on
defensive
collateral
estoppel.
you
don't
need
to
solve
the
problem
of
offensive.
i
guess
you're
just
saying
that
once
there's
been
a
determination
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
that
the
defendant
shouldn't
be
able
to--
justice
white
--not
by
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fitzgibbon,
what
is...
do
you
think
though
that
what
you're
urging
here
is
just
some
federal
court
policy
about
collateral
estoppel
or
is
it
a
statutory
construction
problem
under
1983
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
historically,
hasn't
collateral
estoppel
required
some
mutuality
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
know
what
the
result
would
be
in
the
missouri
courts
if
there
was
a
suit
under
state
law
against
these
officers
for
illegal
search
and
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
the
state
courts
say
that
the
legality
of
the
search
had
already
been
determined
in
the
criminal
trial
and
so
dismiss
the
case
on
collateral
estoppel
grounds
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
missouri
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that
if
a
1983
suit
were
brought
in
the
state
courts,
the
missouri
courts
would
dismiss
the
case
on
collateral
estoppel
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
doesn't
agree
with
that,
does
he,
or
not?
justice
white
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
missouri
law
is
in
this
case,
or
is
it
just
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
white
what
is
the
rule
in
missouri?
justice
white
collateral
estoppel.
about
mutuality.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
there
were
a
suit
in
the
state
courts
similar
to
this
suit
here,
it
wouldn't
be
thrown
out
on...
or
there
would
be
no
mutuality
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would
the
missouri...
well,
and
what
do
you
think
the
state
courts
would
say?
what
would
they
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
historically,
don't
you
understand
that
mutuality
was
required
for
collateral
estoppel?
and
that
it's
only
a
relatively
modern
development?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
when
the
first
missouri
case
was
that
didn't
require
mutuality?
justice
white
did
you
say
there
were
two
recent
cases
or
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
test
it
out.
suppose
there's
a
fourth
amendment
claim
brought
in
on
federal
habeas
claiming
that
there
wasn't
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
state
court
and
the
federal
district
court
agrees,
holds
a
new
hearing,
and
finds
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
denies
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
then
the
petitioner
who
is
a
defendant
in
the
state
court
in
the
criminal
action
sues
on
1983
claiming
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
sues
the
police
officers.
the
police
officers
say,
collateral
estoppel.
what
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn't
claim
a...
you
would
say
that
collateral
estoppel
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
that's
what
is
really
at
issue
is
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you're
really
saying
this
is
a
1983
policy?
justice
white
and
that
this
court
was
not
a
federal
forum?
justice
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
we
had
just
denied
cert?
