justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fitzgibbon,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case?
as
i
understand
it
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
the
trial
court,
or
his
motion
to
suppress
was
denied,
and
he
had
an
appeal
pending
to
the
missouri
state
courts
on
that
point
at
the
time
he
brought
his
1983
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
didn't...
although
it
said
you
can't
use
collateral
estoppel
once
the
state
process
is
finished,
it
directed
the
federal
district
court
to
abstain
while
he,
the
defendant,
perfected
his
appeal
through
the
missouri
court
system.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
typically,
in
your
criminal
trial,
a
motion
to
suppress
may
be
granted
notwithstanding
the
good
faith
immunity
of
the
officers
in
a
1983
action,
and
if
there
were
then,
the
motion
to
suppress
were
granted,
wouldn't
that
be
conclusive
as
to
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
in
a
1983
action,
so
that
the
only
matter
open
would
be
the
good
faith
of
the
officers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fitzgibbon,
i
notice
that
neither
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
8th
circuit
nor
you
nor
your
opponents
mention
the
decision
of
this
court
in
stefanelli
v.
minard
at
342
us
which
strikes
me
as
being
very
much
on
point
with
your
case,
except
there
there
the
injunction
was
sought
under
1983
before
the
evidence
was
introduced
and
it
was
an
effort
to
enjoin
the
use
by
the
prosecution
of
the
evidence
in
the
criminal
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shank,
returning
for
a
moment
to
the
failure
of
your
client
to
seek
certiorari
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
missouri
judgment
affirming
the
conviction,
isn't
one
of
the
underpinnings
of
our
opinion,
stone
v.
powell,
the
right
that...
the
fact
that
this
court
is
open
to
remedy
erroneous
rulings
on
search
and
seizure?
and
if
you
allow
a
1983
action
in
every
case
where
stone
v.
powell
bars
habeas,
you're
pretty
well
overruling
stone
v.
powell.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
in
each
case,
wouldn't
the
guts
of
the
constitutional
claim
or
the
federal
claim
be
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
doesn't
stone
v.
powell
say,
you
petition
for
certiorari
here
rather,
because
relief
is
not
available
on
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
make
any
claim
that
there
was
not
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
missouri
courts
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
8th
circuit
opinion
really
fall
between
two
stools,
in
effect,
and
they
leave
what
could
be
arguably
the
worst
possible
result?
it
says,
in
effect,
for
the
federal
district
court
not
to
intervene
in
1983
until
the
matter
has
gone
all
the
way
through
the
state
courts,
but
then
it
may
intervene.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
if
you're
talking
about
considerations
of
federalism
or
comity,
perhaps
there
is
a
greater
affront
to
the
state
systems
if
the
federal
court
does
not
intervene
until
it's,
say,
gone
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
and
then
the
federal
court
decides
differently
than
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
you
don't
regard
this
court
as
a
federal
forum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
even
though
you
could
come
here
from
the
highest
court
of
missouri
if
you
felt
the
highest
court
of
missouri
had
misinterpreted
1983?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
do
with
stefanelli
v.
minard,
which
refused
to
enjoin
the
use
of
evidence
in
a
state
court
even
though
the
contention
was
that
it
had
been
seized
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
all
the
cases
cited
in
the
footnote
in
preiser
v.
rodriguez?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
all
of
these
turn
on
the
effect
of
stone?
