justice
jr.
and
did
the
case
go
to
the
missouri
supreme
court,
mr.
fitzgibbon?
justice
jr.
could
he
have
gone
to
the
missouri
supreme
court?
justice
jr.
could
the
defendant
have
taken
his
conviction
to
the
missouri
supreme
court?
justice
jr.
or
could
it
have
come
here
from
the
missouri
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
no,
but
cert
might
have
been
sought
here
from
the
missouri
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
fitzgibbon,
did
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
decide
the
fourth
amendment
claim?
justice
jr.
and
that
turned
on
federal
law?
justice
jr.
mr.
fitzgibbon,
no
reference
is
made,
is
there,
in
the
appellate
court's
decision
to
mincey
v.
arizona?
justice
jr.
i
just
wonder
on
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel,
because
that's
intervening
law;
it's
relevant
here.
what
then
was
the
posture
of
your
collateral
estoppel?
justice
jr.
doesn't
mincey
v.
arizona
have
some
bearing
on
the
resolution
of
that?
justice
jr.
under
mincey?
justice
jr.
oh,
did
it?
justice
jr.
do
we
have
that
opinion
of
the...
i
was
under
the
impression
that
there
was
no
reference
in
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
the
intervening
decisions.
justice
jr.
mr.
fitzgibbon,
is
this
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
appendix
c
of
the
petition?
justice
jr.
i
just
looked
at
it
and
i
don't
see
any
reference
to
mincey.
justice
jr.
oh,
i
see.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
see
it
cited.
justice
jr.
thank
you.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
now,
as
your
colleague
told
us,
there's
a
difference,
is
there,
in
the
officers
involved
in
the
search
of
the
tires
and
the
drawers,
the
evidence
that
was
suppressed?
a
different
officer
than
any
of
these
defendants?
justice
jr.
were
any
of
these
defendants
involved
in
those
searches?
justice
jr.
dealing
with
the
suppressed
items?
justice
jr.
and
by
that
time
this
action
was
pending
in
the--
justice
jr.
well,
you
recall,
it
used
to
be
that...
until
we
overruled
it...
that
under
darr
and
burford
you
couldn't
go
into
the
federal
habeas
unless
you
first
sought
cert
in
this
court.
but
i
guess
it's
never
been
the
rule
that
you
could
not
come,
start
a
1983
action
without
first
exhausting
by
application
for
cert
with
this
court.
justice
jr.
you
were
neither
in
the
state
court
nor...
was
he
represented
at
all
in
the
state
court?
justice
jr.
but
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
the
1983
he
was
not?
justice
jr.
so
if
anyone
was
to
tell
the
federal
district
judge,
it
would
have
to
be
the
respondent
himself.
there
was
no
lawyer
then.
justice
jr.
do
you
think
it's
relevant
at
all
whether
where
1983
was
adopted
in
1871...
collateral
estoppel
had
a
requirement
of
mutuality?
do
you
think
it's
relevant
at
all
to
our
decision
here?
if
we're
dealing
with
a
construction
of
1983
and
if
where
1983
was
required
collateral
estoppel
was
not
recognized
except
in
situations
of
mutuality,
does
that
apply
here?
justice
jr.
all
i'm
asking...
if
you
are
urging
that
as
part
of
your
position?
justice
jr.
but
not
for
that
reason?
justice
jr.
i
gather
what
you're
saying
is
the
contour
of
the
1983
action,
whether
brought
in
federal
or
state
court,
has
to
be
the
same?
justice
jr.
well,
logically,
i
suppose
you'd
say,
if
he
had
come
directly
here
and
we
had
granted
certiorari
and
we
had
passed
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
sustained
the
state
court,
that
then
he
could
not
go
into
1983
because
he
had
had
his
federal
forum.
