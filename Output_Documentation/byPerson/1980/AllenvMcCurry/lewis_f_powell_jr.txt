justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
shank,
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
that
if
instead
of
having
a
fourth
amendment
issue
you
had
a
fifth...
say
you
were
bringing
a
1983
case
on
the
theory
that
a
confession
had
been
extorted
by
force
or
violence,
would
collateral
estoppel
apply
in
that
situation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
answer
is
that
collateral
estoppel
would
apply?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
a
1983
suit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
it
not
true
that
your
basic
position
is
that
stone
is
immaterial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
i
think
you
responded
to
an
earlier
question
that
if
this
were
a
fifth
amendment
claim
you'd
still
make
the
same
argument.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
i
understand.
i'm
not
talking
about
habeas
corpus.
i'm
talking
about
the
1983
suit
for
damages
brought
in
a
federal
court
where
a
state
court
had
applied
a
fifth
amendment...
on
the
fifth
amendment
issue
had
acted
contrary
to
the
position
your
client
would
take
in
1983.
you
say
no
collateral
estoppel
there,
also?
