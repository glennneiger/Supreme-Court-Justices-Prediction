justice
blackmun
bring
me
up
to
date.
what
is
the
status
of
the
criminal
case
on
the
state
side?
has
it
been
affirmed?
justice
blackmun
was
cert
applied
for?
justice
blackmun
was
cert
applied
for?
justice
blackmun
well,
certiorari
from
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
which
for
this
case
is
the
highest
court
in
missouri.
there
is
no
right
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
on
the
criminal
case,
as
i
understand
that.
am
i
correct?
justice
blackmun
counsel,
certainly
that
issue
is
here,
but
straighten
me
out
on
one
other
little
detail.
there
is
an
assault
claim
here
also,
isn't
there?
justice
blackmun
and
there
is
a
statement
in
some
of
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
that
judge
meredith,
if
it
was
judge
meredith,
bypassed
or
failed
to
pass
upon
that
issue.
what's
your
comment
on
that
one?
justice
blackmun
so
that
may
have
to
go
back?
justice
blackmun
did
you
move
for
rehearing
en
banc
in
the
8th
circuit?
justice
blackmun
mr.
shank,
your
office
did
not
represent
him
in
the
state
court
proceedings?
justice
blackmun
but
you
were
not
counsel
at
the
trial
level,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
the
other
side
of
this
coin
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
raised
is
that
if
collateral
estoppel
applies,
then
in
effect
state
court
is
the
final
arbiter.
justice
blackmun
and
1983
is,
has
its
roots
cut
out
from
under,
if
it
ever
applied.
of
course,
historically,
you'd
probably
have
something
else
again.
