justice
stewart
--or
involving
the
same
search.
justice
stewart
well,
your
point
is
that
1983
actions
should
not
be
exceptions
from
the
generally
applicable
doctrine.
is
that
right?
justice
stewart
even
when
the
1983
action
is
based
upon
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
than
even
in
the
presence
of
stone
v.
powell.
justice
stewart
which
is
really
what
the
8th
circuit
limited
this
exception
to,
as
i
understand
it.
well,
on
that
formulation,
then,
it's
both.
it's
also
a
1983
statutory
construction
problem
to
the
extent
that
you
construe
1983
as
not
intending
an
exception.
yes.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
not
really
before
us,
is
it?
justice
stewart
an
alternative.
justice
stewart
the
district
court
in
other
words
granted
more
than
the
defendant
had
asked.
justice
stewart
well,
indeed,
you
have
to
assume
that
there
was
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
otherwise
federal
habeas
corpus
would
be
available
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit
would
be
inapplicable.
justice
stewart
at
all,
ever?
justice
stewart
and
then,
to
go
further,
than
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit?
justice
stewart
limiting
the
elimination
of
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
to
cases,
1983
cases
where
the
claim
is
the
fourth
amendment
violation
and
post-stone
v.
powell?
justice
stewart
well,
you
don't
really
know.
the
state
court
might
find
the
same
exception
that
the
federal
court
of
appeals
found.
justice
stewart
well,
this
court
has
held
that
there
could
be
an
action,
a
1983
action
in
a
state
court.
justice
stewart
and
the
state
of
missouri
might
find
the
same
exception
to
its
generally
applicable
rule
of
collateral
estoppel
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
8th
circuit.
justice
stewart
and
under
the
decision
now
before
it.
justice
stewart
it's
not
your
view
that
it
ought
to
be?
justice
stewart
mr.
shank,
just
before
the
noon
recess
you
mentioned
a
couple
of
recent
decisions,
one
in
the
9th
circuit
in
this
general
area?
justice
stewart
are
they
in
your
brief?
justice
stewart
in
the
9th
circuit?
justice
stewart
and
what
did
that
case
decide?
justice
stewart
and
what
did
it
decide,
what
did
it
hold?
justice
stewart
in
this
particular
situation,
fourth
amendment
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
number
79-935
is
hereby
way
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
at
a
hearing
before
his
criminal
trial
in
a
missouri
court,
the
respondent,
willie
mccurry
invoked
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
suppress
evidence
that
had
been
seized
by
the
police.
the
trial
court
denied
the
suppression
motion
in
part,
and
mccurry
was
subsequently
convicted
after
a
jury
trial.
and
that
conviction
was
later
affirmed
on
appeal
because
he
did
not
assert
that
the
state
courts
had
denied
him
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
his
search
and
seizure
claim.
mccurry
was
barred
by
this
court's
decision
in
stone
against
powell
from
seeking
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
federal
district
court.
nevertheless,
he
sought
federal
habeas
and
federal
court
were
addressed
for
the
alleged
constitutional
violation
by
bringing
a
damaged
suit
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983
against
the
officers
who
had
entered
his
home
and
seized
the
evidence
in
question.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
because
of
the
unavailability
of
deferral
habeas
corpus.
the
defendants
were
prevented
from
raising
the
state
court’s
partial
rejection
of
mccurry's
constitutional
claim
as
a
collateral
estoppel
defense
to
the
1983
suit
against
them.
for
the
reasons
sent
out
in
some
detail
in
the
court
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
in
ruling
that
mccurry’s
inability
to
obtain
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
upon
his
fourth
amendment
claim
renders
--
rendered
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
inapplicable
to
his
1983
claim.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
court’s
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
have
joined.
