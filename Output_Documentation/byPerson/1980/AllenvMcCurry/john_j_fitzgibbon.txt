mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
multi-facet
case
which
arose
out
of
the
8th
circuit.
it
concerns
the
proposition
as
to
whether
or
not
collateral
estoppel
applies
when
a
prisoner
seeks
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983.
in
this
particular
case
the
8th
circuit
held
that
because
of
the
special
role
of
the
federal
courts
in
protecting
civil
rights
and
because
habeas
corpus
is
now
unavailable
to
the
appellant
in
this
case
under
the
decision
of
stone
v.
powell,
it
is
the
duty
of
that
court
to
consider
fully,
unencumbered
by
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
the
appellant's
1983
claims.
this
goes
back
to
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i
guess
you
would
have
the
starting
point
would
be
the
original
ku
klux
klan
act,
or
the
civil
rights
act,
wherein
the
congress
gave
the
power
to
federal
courts
to
determine
constitutional
rights
and
to
give
persons
remedies
for
damages
and
a
federal
forum
to
air
their
constitutional
claims,
the
reason
being
that
there
was
great
distrust
that
the
state
courts
would
not
comply
with
federal
constitutional
law,
and
make
a
mockery
of
justice.
however,
this
particular
act
has
been
somewhat
modified.
i
believe
this
court
has
stated
that
the
state
courts
are
able
to
rule
constitutional
issues
involving
federal
constitutional
law,
and
that
some
trust
has
to
be
placed
in
state
courts
concerning
this
issue.
going
back
to
the
civil
rights
act,
i
believe
that
in
this
day
and
age
things
have
drastically
changed
and
that
state
courts
are
applying
constitutional
law,
federal
constitutional
law,
and
are
complying
with
all
decisions
of
this
particular
court,
especially
in
the
role
of
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
right.
and
also
the
8th
circuit
has
reference
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
case
regarding
the
hearing
that
he
had
on
his
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
they
were
aware
of
that
particular
decision
and
it
so
states
in
their
decision.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
it
did
not.
it
is
limited
on
this
particular
issue
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
so
that
there
was
no
further--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--pardon
me?
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
your
honor,
not
under
our
law.
it
would
have
to
stop
at
the
missouri
court
of
appeals,
and
it
would
not
go
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
from
the
missouri
court
of
appeals?
it
could
have
come
here
by
way
of
certiorari.
and
of
course,
under
stone
v.
powell,
it
couldn't
very
well
come
here
under
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
it
could
have
come
very
well
by
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
particular
court.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
it
was
affirmed
by
the
missouri
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
pardon
me?
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
particular
point
because
i
am
not
the
prosecutor
in
the
case,
i
represent
the
police
officers.
whether
or
not
cert
was
applied
for
or
not
i
really
don't
know,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
sir.
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
am
not
familiar
as
to
whether
or
not
that's--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--no,
not
under
our
state
law.
no.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
determines
those
issues
and
that
is
final.
it
appears
that
in
the--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
they
decided
that
the
search
and
seizure
was
lawful
and
that
he
was
convicted
upon
constitutional
standards
of
search
and
seizure
and
therefore
his
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
on
federal
law,
and
they
so
cited
the
federal
rules
concerning
that
in
federal
cases.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
guess
you'd
have
to
go
back
to
the
civil
rights
act
to
find
out
what
the
effect
was
and
whether
or
not
collateral
estoppel
should
apply.
the
federal
rules,
federal
cases,
cases
of
this
court,
i
guess
seem
to
indicate
that
there
are
some
common
law
defenses
available
in
a
1983
action.
and
some
of
those
defenses
would
be,
for
instance,
judicial
immunity
under
stump
v.
sparkman
and
recognized
defenses
to
1983
actions.
and
this
is
imbedded
into
the
common
law.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
should
the
common
law
defenses
be
now
abandoned
because
of
42
u.s.
code
section
1983?
there
are
recognized
defenses
to
that.
for
instance,
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
you
don't
file
your
claim
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
you
don't
have
any
claim
any
more.
of
course,
that
being
statutory
law
it
is
imbedded
that
stale
claims
should
not
be
heard
by
courts.
in
this
particular
instance,
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
common
law
always
did
recognize
that
collateral
estoppel
will
apply,
that
if
you
have
had
a
fair
and
full
hearing
on
an
issue,
in
my
words,
you
only
get
one
bite
at
the
apple,
the
idea
being
to
give
some
finality
to
litigation.
it
has
to
stop
somewhere.
now,
the
issue
in
this
particular
case
is
if
the
prisoner
in
this
particular
case
was
given
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
state
court's
suppression
of
the
evidence
case.
does
he
now
have
a
right,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
has
been
shown
by
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
that
the
search
was
legal
and
constitutional,
can
he
now
go
to
the
federal
district
court
on
a
petition
for
damages
and
relitigate
that
same
issue
which
has
been
litigated
before
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding?
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
right.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
when
we
started
off
this
case
i
asked
the
court
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
that
we're
here
on
today,
and
the
court,
i
guess
inadvertently,
granted
me
full
summary
judgment,
which
i
really
didn't
ask
for.
i
was
willing
to
go
to
trial
with
the
assault.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
that...
yes;
yes.
that
probably
will
be
tried.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
that
was
remanded
and
that
issue
should
be
tried.
i
didn't
address
that
issue;
i
wanted
to
get
this
issue
into
the
eye
of
the
court
so
they
could
rule
on
this
particular
thing
in
our
circuit.
now,
some
of
the
cases
have
made
distinctions
on
whether
or
not
you
voluntarily
go
into
a
court,
submit
to
their
jurisdiction,
get
a
result
which
you
don't
like,
and
then
try
to
relitigate
that
same
issue.
i
don't
think
the
test
is
whether
you
voluntarily
go
into
court.
in
montana
v.
united
states
the
united
states
government
voluntarily
went
into
court,
into
a
state
court
involving
a
constitutional
issue
and
asked
the
court
to
rule
on
those
issues,
and
the
court
did.
then
the
united
states
tried
to
get
into
the
federal
system,
to
have
another
bite
at
that
particular
apple
when
the
court
in
the
state
court
had
ruled
the
federal
constitutional
issues
in
that
particular
case.
now,
the
cases
that
were
cited
by
the
8th
circuit,
or
where
they
say
that...
well,
these
cases
were
before
stone
v.
powell,
and
therefore,
since
stone
v.
powell
has
taken
away
habeas
corpus
on
fourth
amendment
violations,
virtually,
that
therefore
we
have
to
have
a
federal
forum
and
some
of
these
cases
go
off
on
the
theory,
well,
since
it's
a
criminal
case,
the
prisoner
didn't
ask
to
be
in
the
courtroom
and
the
prisoner
didn't
really
ask
to
have
these
particular
issues
decided
but
he
was
forced
to
be
there
and
he
was
forced
to
bring
up
these
issues...
and
they
take
off
on
a
tack
saying,
well,
if
he
wants
to
have
a
1983
action
for
damages,
then
he
can't
litigate
that
in
the
state
court,
he's
going
to
get
convicted
because
he's
not
going
to
bring
that
up.
i
think
that's
absolutely
false.
if
a
person
is
in
court
and
is
going,
may
have
to
do
some
time,
he
is
going
to
bring
up
that
particular
issue
of
suppression
of
the
evidence
and
litigate
that
as
fully
as
possible.
i
think
the
last
thought
in
somebody's
mind
who
is
in
that
courtroom
is,
oh
boy,
my
damage
claim
is
going
to
come
up
now,
they
are
vitally
interested
in
having
an
acquittal
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
in
his
motion...
he
had
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
in
that
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
he
identified
another
police
office
who
he
alleges
assaulted
him
while
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
with
his
hands
behind
his
back.
the
two
officers
that
he
shot,
of
course,
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
particular
assault
because
they
were
immediately,
got
medical
aid
and
they
were
taken
off
to
the
hospital.
so
it
would
be
a
third
officer
who
he
identified
in
his
cross
petition
for
summary
judgment.
i
don't
think
that
the
test
is
whether
an
issue
is
decided,
whether
you're
there
voluntarily
or
involuntarily.
i
think
that
the
test
that
should
be
applied
in
state
court
proceedings
is
to
whether
or
not
he
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
this
particular
issue,
to
present
witnesses
on
behalf
of
himself
on
the
suppression
issue,
and
that
that
should
be
binding,
and
if
the
state
court
finds
that
this
is
constitutional.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
if
the
evidence
was
excluded--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--there
is
one
case
which
holds,
i
believe,
that
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
in
that
case
could
be
by
stipulation
introduced
to
reach
a
result.
but
the--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--right.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
he
could
go
back,
if
the
issue
is
decided
in
his
favor,
certainly,
under
1983.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
it
could
go
in.
i
don't
think
the
courts
have
distinguished
in
collateral
estoppel
or
what
they
call
issue
preclusion;
or...
you
have
three
things--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--as
i
understand
the
question,
if
it
were
determined
in
his
favor
that
the
search
was
unlawful--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--then
he
could
fully
litigate
his
1983
claims
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
no.
you
couldn't
get
summary
judgment
because
then
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
there
was
good
faith
and
probable
cause
to
recognize
defenses
to
actions
for
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
it
would
be
open
in
a
1983
suit?
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
or
he
could
proceed
to
trial,
in
a
jury
trial
against
the
police
officers.
it's
not
preclusive
upon
the
police
officers.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
think
at
that
time
the
good
faith
of
the...
many
times
the
officers
may
violate
the
constitution
inadvertently
through
lack
of
knowledge
on
their
part
of
what
the
law
is,
the
law
is
such
a
morass
of
rules
for
the
police
officer.
i
don't
think
they
intentionally
try
to
violate
anybody's
rights,
they
violate
by
inadvertence.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
have
another
bite
at
the
apple,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
your
honor,
because
the
whole
posture
of
this
particular
case
was
based
on
a
conspiracy
of
the
two
officers
to
conduct
an
illegal
search,
the
two
officers
that
were
shot
by
this
prisoner.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
not
by
them.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no.
the
whole
tenor
of
the
thing
is
that
these
two
police
officers
who
came
up
to
the
door
to
buy
narcotics
conspired
to
illegally
have
a
search
and
seizure
of
this
particular
property.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
is
not
a
defendant.
that's
officer
brand.
he
is
a
different...
he
was
called
the
seizing
officer
in
the
case.
but
that
is
not
the
particular
issue
in
this
case.
the
posture
is
that
he
started,
he
alleges
that
our
two
police
officers
conspired
to
illegally
search
his
home.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
if
you're
talking
about
the
stuff
which
was
suppressed,
it's
narcotics.
what
are
his--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--well,
that's
another
problem
that
we
have.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
in
the
appellate,
in
the
8th
circuit,
of
mincey
v.
arizona?
no.
the
8th
circuit
made
no
mention
of
that.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
are
you
saying
that
because...
well,
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
went
into
this
particular
issue
and
said
that--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--the
missouri
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
that
particular
issue--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--and
said...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i'm
referring
to
the
missouri
court
of
appeals,
not
to
the
8th
circuit.
the
8th
circuit
just
didn't
even
get
into
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
these
facts
show
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
believe
it
might
be
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
brief,
it
would
be
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--i
think
he
was
only
interested
in
the
evidence
that
was
seized
and
used
against
him
in
the
particular
proceeding,
the
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
you
can't
give
marijuana
back
to
somebody.
it's
contraband;
it
has
to
be
destroyed.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
issue
of
what
was
the
street
value
of
the
heroin,
and
that's
the
question
of
damages,
i
don't
see
how
we're
going
to
reach
that.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
it's
on
page...
appendix
16.
it's
the
first
page.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
there
was
a
reference
made
to
it.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
have
come
to
a
further
conclusion
on
this
case
concerning
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
in
stone
v.
powell
this
court
went
into
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
results
concerning
this,
that
there
is
probably
some
displeasure
with
the
exclusionary
rule
because
it,
i
guess
it
shunts
away
whether
or
not
a
person
is
guilty
or
innocent
and
goes
into
the
evidence,
whether
or
not
this
evidence
was
seized
legally
or
illegally.
it
seems
that
if
the
exclusionary
rule
were
abolished
i
myself
would
be
willing
to
defend
each
and
every
police
officer
on
a
damage
claim.
it
appears
that
the
exclusionary
rule
doesn't
really
accomplish
that
much.
the
deterrent
effect
of
that
is
placed
upon
society
when
i
think
the
deterrent
effect
should
really
be
placed
upon
a
police
officer,
the
police
officer
who
does...
say,
intentionally...
violate
somebody's
rights
by
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
onus
of
that
should
be
placed
upon
the
police
officer
in
an
action
for
damages
and
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
very
much
curtailed
and
that
evidence
which
is
found
in
the
possession...
i
believe,
by
this
court,
as
it
has
already
indicated...
possession
of
burglar
tools,
possession
of
heroin,
some
great
evidence
in
a
trial
that
this
person
is
particularly
versed
and
skillful--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--i
don't
think
it's
a...
under
1983
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
history,
that
the
framers
of
that
particular
law
and
the
congressional
reports
on
this
show
any
indication
that
they
wish
to
abolish
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
believe
the
courts
have
gone
further,
and
mutuality...
you
mean
the
mutuality
of
the
same
parties
and
the
same
issues?
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
that
would
be
res
judicata.
but
they
talk
of
collateral
estoppel
where
the
issue
is
put
into
focus
and
there's
a
full
trial,
full,
fair
hearing
on
that,
that
that
should
be
collateral
estoppel
on
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
they
could
go
either
way
in
our
state
courts.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
if
a
full
and
fair
hearing
were--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--yes.
i
think
counsel
has
given
me
the
case
of
larose
v.
casey
and
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
right.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
search
and
seizure
matter.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
don't
think
he
does.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
it's
a
question
of
collateral
estoppel
under
the
common
law.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
a
matter
of
federal
law
involving
collateral
estoppel
as
to
whether
or
not
it
applies
in
1983
actions.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case,
your
honor.
i
guess
under
the
doctrine
of
abstention
they
would
allow,
should
allow
the
state
courts
to
continue
their
criminal
prosecution
and
the
criminal
processes
against--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--there's
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
court
to
do
so,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
if
there
were
a
full
and
fair
hearing
below.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
i
think
that
the
state
decision
on
constitutional
law
would
be
binding.
i
think
the
states
do
have
the
power.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
the
doctrine,
the
common
law
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
that's
correct.
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
as
i
say,
in
conclusion,
i
would
be
willing
to
defend
any
police
officer
concerning
illegal
search
and
seizure
and
give
them,
if
the
court
needs
some
remedy
for
these
persons
who
claim
that
their
fourth
amendment
constitutional
rights
were
violated
and
action
for
damages
for
this
rather
than
excluding
the
evidence
of
any
particular
criminal
trial.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
no,
your
honor,
but
following
the
whole
theory
of
this,
since
habeas
corpus
was
taken
away
in
stone
v.
powell,
the
8th
circuit
has
tried
to
give
some
kind
of
a
remedy--
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
--some
kind
of
an
alternative
remedy
so
that
a
federal
court
will
look
at
this
particular
problem.
mr.
john
j.
fitzgibbon
in
the
8th
circuit?
no.
we
asked
for
no
rehearing.
we
directly
petitioned
this
court
for
certiorari.
