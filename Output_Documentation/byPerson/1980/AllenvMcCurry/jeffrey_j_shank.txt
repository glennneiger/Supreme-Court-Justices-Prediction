mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
particularly
appropriate
at
this
time,
possibly,
to
review
briefly
the
factual
setting
for
clarification
purposes.
respondent
filed
his
civil
rights
action
alleging
three
general
areas,
one,
the
assault
matter,
which
has
been
discussed
with
the
court;
secondly,
he
raised
a
search
question
in
two
areas,
one,
a
conspiracy
situation
and
secondly
alleging
individual
defendants.
the
petitioner
filed
his
motion
to
dismiss
and
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment.
he
alleged
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
to
the
assault,
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action,
and
as
to
the
remainder
in
that
motion
to
dismiss,
res
judicata.
as
to
his
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment,
he
raised
the
issue
of
res
judicata,
solely.
the
district
court
granted
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
toto,
did
not
consider
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
district
court
in
relying--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--that's
correct,
sir.
and
neither
did
he...
it
appeared
the
court
might
have
been
ruling
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
used
the
terminology
under
the
summary
judgment.
that's
unclear.
the
district
court
said
that
the
only
issue
that
it
had
was
whether
or
not
the
entrance
into
the
respondent's
home
was
lawful
and
that
this
was
litigated
in
state
court.
the
state
court
in
the
criminal
proceedings
at
the
trial
level
held,
one,
that
a
portion
of
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed,
and
a
portion
of
it
was
not.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
anything
that
was
found
in
some
drawers,
in
some
tires,
evidence
that
was
found
in
plain
view.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that's
my
understanding.
there
were
some
drugs
found
outside
as
well
as,
in
a
plain
view
situation
as
well
as
otherwise.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
there
was
one
other
officer
that
was--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--they
would
have
been
involved.
as
to
the
conspiracy
claimed
it's
quite
possible
that
the
named
officers
jacobsmeyer
and
allen
would
have
been
involved
in
the
conspiracy
to
violate
the--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--correct,
sir.
also,
as
to
the...
we
also
pled,
or
the
respondent
who
was
pro
se
pled
that
there
were
unknown
defendants.
we
subsequently
learned
the
names
of
those
particular
defendants,
and
the
8th
circuit
gave
us
leave
to
amend
the
assault
claim
and
we
would
also
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
amend
as
to
the
individual
defendants
who
would
be
involved
in
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
to
conduct...
to
conduct
the
unlawful
search.
yes,
sir.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
upheld,
as
we've
discussed,
the
findings
of
the
state
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
to
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
as
a
practicality
of
the
situation,
i
believe
respondent
had
retained
counsel
and
had
no
access
to
anyone
to
file
the
writ
other
than
possibly
pro
se.
i
think
that's
a
practical
reason
for
it.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
in
'79,
in
the
missouri
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir,
it
was.
yes,
sir.
the
district
court--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--i
don't
think
the
respondent
had
the
knowledge
or
the
ability
at
that
time
to
proceed
with
the
writ
of
certiorari
before
this
court.
i
can't
tell
the
court
that
it
was
an
intelligent
or
a
knowing
decision
not
to
seek
a
writ
of
certiorari
before
this
court.
it
could
have
been;
we
don't
know.
if
the
court
would
be
asking,
would
that
be
providing
a
remedy,
as
opposed
to
the
federal
court,
to
proceed
in
a
civil
rights
action
to
review
the
matter,
we
would
suggest
that
the
congressional
and
legislative
history
of
1983,
the
fact
that
the
district
court
would
be
able
to
give
a
more
inclusive
factfinding
of
the
circumstances,
the
fact
that
the
respondent
in
the
state
case...
defendant
there...
was
really
compelled
to
raise
those
issues
there--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--to
my
knowledge
there
is
no
exhaustion
requirement
for
1983
action.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
before
it.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
he
would
have
been
aware
of
that;
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
if
the
court
is
asking
me
if
he
was
aware
if
counsel
was
aware
that
a
civil
rights
action
had
been
filed,
i
would
tend
to
believe
he
probably
was
not,
because
the
respondent
filed
the
pro
se
motion
and
certainly
would
have
sought
assistance
of
counsel,
i'm
sure,
at
that
time.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir,
we
were
appointed
by
the
8th
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
represent
him
on
the
appeal
from
the
federal
district
court's
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
my
sole--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--no,
i
would...
my
basis
on
that
is
from
the
tenor
of
the
petition
filed,
or
the
complaint
filed
in
the
federal
district
court.
certainly
if
counsel
was
involved,
the
petition,
the
complaint
as
filed
would
have
been
in
a
lot
better
form.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
i
believe
in
the
court
of
appeals
level
the
court
of
appeals
was
aware
of
it
at
that
time.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
the
federal
district
court?
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
any
court?
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
under
our
interpretation
of
1983,
it
would
not
be
because
we
would--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--if
the
first
case
pending
would
be
determinative
of
the
second
case,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
duty.
except
that
if
it
would
not
be,
i
don't
feel
that
there
would
be
a
duty
to
inform
the
second
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
it's
quite
possible--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--well,
it's
quite
possible
that
the
federal
court
could
then,
could
abstain
while
the
state
court
was
handling
its
receivings.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
i
understand
that.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
i
understand
what
the
court
is
saying.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir,
nor
at
the--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--in
the
state
trial
court
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir,
it
was
filed
pro
se.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
part
of
the...
in
that
case
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
defendant
could
raise
the
issue
similar,
as
he
did
here,
and
it
would
come
before
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
sir,
in
the
stone
v.
powell
matter
i
believe
the
court
indicated
that
if
a
state
court
provided
a
full
and
fair
hearing
or
opportunity
to
raise
the
fourth
amendment
issues,
the
habeas
corpus
would
not
be
an
available
remedy
to
a
respondent
or
defendant.
our
feeling
is
that
it's...
the
federal
court
in
reviewing
that
would
only
be
reviewing
a
due
process
situation.
it
would
not
be
reviewing
the
substantive
application
of
the
constitutional
rights,
whether
or
not
the
substantive
rights
had
been
violated.
it
would
be
looking
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
hearing,
whether
or
not
evidence
was
presented,
not
necessarily
how
the
law
was
applied.
it's
quite
possible
the
law
could
have
been
applied
inappropriately.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
the
underlying
claim
would
be
but
what
the
court
would
be
reviewing
would
not
be
the
same.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
i
feel
that
the
reviewing
court,
if
we
use
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
kind
of
test,
would
only
be
reviewing
whether
or
not
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
issue,
whether
or
not
their
evidence
was
presented,
and
that
type
of
situation.
but
i
don't
believe
the
reviewing
court's
going
to
look
at
how
the
law
was
applied
to
the
facts.
it's
quite
possible
that
the
state
court
could
apply
law
that's
contradictory
to
the
present
status
of
the
federal--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--so
it
would
be
as
a
matter...
you
could
proceed
under
the
habeas
corpus.
of
course,
if
there
was
a
denial
of
a
full
and
fair
hearing,
if
there
was,
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
that
denial,
then
of
course
habeas
would
be
available.
and
likewise,
if
we
get
into
the
realm
of
the
collateral
estoppel
issue,
the
ruling
on
the
habeas
might
well
void
the
conviction
itself,
so
collateral
estoppel
would
never
come
into
play.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
we
did
not
raise
that
claim
before
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
correct.
we
would
have
proceeded
through
habeas;
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
again,
our
position
would
be
that
clearly
the
collateral
estoppel
is
inapplicable
to
1983.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
yes,
but
that's
not
the
issue
we're
raising
before
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us
a
very
limited
issue,
and
that's
all
we're
asking
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--correct.
that
way
there
would
be
no
viable
federal
forum
to
vindicate
the
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
our
position
would
be,
no,
but
we're
not...
we
go
beyond
that
to
clearly...
the
two-prong
test
that
petitioner
suggested,
whether
or
not
a
common
law
application
would
be
applied,
is
that
assuming,
which
it
was,
mutuality
applied,
then
this
case
would
never
have
gotten
here
in
the
first
place,
because
i
don't
believe
there
was
mutuality
of
the
parties,
so
the
federal
court
never
would
have
been
able
to
present
the
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir.
our
position
would
be
in
the
issue
before
this
court,
collateral
estoppel
is
inapplicable.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
not
for
that
reason.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
but
we
feel
that
we
would
not
be
interfering
with
the
comity
of
federalism
because
we
would
never
be
in
a
position
asking
necessarily
for
the
state
conviction
to
be
overturned,
we're
not
asking
that
a
person
in
respondent's
case
be
removed
from
jail,
we're
not
asking
that
the
state
limit
or
revise
the
application
of,
say,
the
exclusionary
rule.
so
we
don't
feel
that
we're
really
interfering
with
the
state
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
as
to?
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
there
is
no
mutuality
in
my
understanding
of
collateral
estoppel
in
the
state.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
correct,
sir,
and
we
would
have
a
set
of
circumstances
similar
to
that's
before
this
court,
the
defendant
in
that
case
could
raise
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
quite
possibly.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
would
they
apply
collateral
estoppel?
i
think
the
state
court
probably
would.
that's
enough...
that's
the
whole
reason
for
the--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--well,
i
think
the
doctrine
lying
behind
the
civil
rights
act
itself
was
that
there
would
be
a
federal
forum
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
a
state--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--correct.
i
understand
that.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
correct.
and
it
may
not.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that's
correct,
sir.
at
the
time
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
was
passed,
mutuality
did
exist.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i'd
be
glad
to
brief
that
to
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
in
that
situation
a
habeas
corpus
remedy
would
be
available
and
in
that
circumstance
the
federal
forum
would
be
available
and
we
would...
again,
our
position
would
be
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
clearly
precludes
it.
but
quite
possibly
that
would
be
a
logical
course
to
follow.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
under--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--under
those
circumstances.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir,
my
view
would
be
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
1983
precludes
the
application
of
collateral
estoppel
in
any
circumstance.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
oh,
yes;
yes,
sir.
i'm
just
saying
that
the
opportunity
at
the
time
when
the
state
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
and
this
respondent
in
this
particular
case
had,
we
can
assume,
a
choice
into
which
court
he
could
proceed,
i
feel
that
it
could
have
proceeded
here
or
it
could
have
proceeded
into
federal
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
if
the
state
court
reviewed
the
civil
rights
act
and
applied
the
legislative
history...
and
i'll
use
the
word
correctly
here,
it's
i
think
then,
that
it
would
have
to
be
using
the
federal
rules
and
that
it
could
deprive
a
respondent
of,
you
know,
the
federal
forum.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that
would
be
our
position,
now,
just
for
unifying
purposes
for
the
federal
and
state
courts
to
follow.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
correct,
but
i
think
that
choice
would
be
as
open
for
respondent.
he
was
compelled
into
the
state
court
situation
by
whatever
reason.
his
first
opportunity
to
make
a
choice
as
to
which
court
he
wants
to
go
into
would
be
after
the
missouri...
in
this
case,
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
had
filed
its
ruling.
there
would
be
no
other
way
for
him
to
preserve
his
federal
claim.
he's
basically
forced
to
have
it
ruled
upon
in
the
state
court,
because
if
he
does
not
he
certainly
would
risk
conviction.
and
i
don't
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
many
people
would
want
to
take
that
risk
involved.
we
then
get
to...
to
follow
that
up,
if
i
may,
we
then
get
to
the
point,
then,
if
the
state
courts
are
able
to
preclude
the
litigation
of
civil
rights
under
the
civil
rights
act,
under
those
circumstances
the
civil
rights
act
for
all
intents
and
purposes
would
be
dead
in
the
majority
of
the
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well
that,
i
would
say,
if
it's
come
to
those
certain
set
of
circumstances,
the
court
was
merely
abstaining
to
let
a
state
court
make
its
determination,
then
certainly
i
don't
think
that
would
necessarily
have
to
preclude
the
litigation
of
the
issue
later
on
once
the
state
court
had
finished.
if
i
may,
to
restate
the
issue
we
are
asking
this
court
specifically
to
rule
on,
it
is
whether
or
not
collateral
estoppel
is
inapplicable
in
1983
actions
alleging
fourth
amendment
violations
when
the
collateral
estoppel
would
violate
1983
legislative
intent
to
provide
a
viable
federal
forum
in
which
someone
could
vindicate
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
this
court
has
never
considered
this
particular
issue
on
point.
prior
to
1976
in
the
stone
v.
powell
decision,
there
had
only
been
two
federal
appellate
courts
that
had
ruled.
subsequent
to
1976,
other
than
the
court
below
in
this
matter,
there
has
only
been
two
matters
ruled
on,
two
cases
ruled
on.
recently
a
9th
circuit
case,
in
august,
1980,
ruled
that
collateral
estoppel
would
be
inapplicable,
and
in
particular
it
noted
that
because
there
was
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court,
it
felt
that
the
collateral
estoppel
would
not
be
applicable.
all
those
cases,
these
latter
cases,
rely
heavily
on
the
legislative
history,
which
clearly
show
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
intended
to--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--okay.
thank
you,
your
honor.

no,
sir.
one
was
just
decided
in
august,
1980.
it's
styled,
johnson
v.
mateer,
et
al.
and
i
just
got
the
number.
it's
number
78-1012.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir,
i
do.
it's
johnson
v.
mateer.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
m-a-t-e-e-r,
et
al.
and
it's
united
states
court
of
appeals,
9th
circuit,
625
fed
2d
248.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that
was
decided
on
august
7,
1980.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
it
held
that
collateral
estoppel
would
be
inapplicable
in
a
situation
as
we've
presented
to
this
court.
it's
on
all
fours.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
that
is
the
most
recent.
the
only
other
case
would
be
the
lower
court
decision
and
a
case
back
in
1977
by
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
those,
your
honor...
most...
preiser
was
decided
before
stone,
i
believe.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
in
our
opinion
that
is
one
of
the
major
considerations;
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir.
we
feel
for
the
purposes
of
the
issue
before
this
court
it
is
all-encompassing
because--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
--yes,
sir.
well,
we
would
there
have
the
availability
of
habeas
corpus
and
we'd
have
the
federal
forum.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
yes,
sir.
in
a
broad
sense
of
it,
i
would
be
in
a
position
to
suggest
that
we
don't
feel
that
the
legislative
history
would
allow
collateral
estoppel
to
apply
in
any
1983
action.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
assuming
that
the
federal
district
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
search,
he
would
then
in
that
instance
have
been
provided
the
federal
forum
that
we
feel
that
is
a
basic
requirement
for
the
1983
action.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
well,
going
beyond
that
point,
then,
i
would
also
suggest
that
it
should
not,
based
on
the
legislative
history,
but
limiting
it
to
the
very
issues
before
us,
we
would...
under
those
circumstances,
then
we
would
have
the
availability
of
the
federal
forum,
which
we
did
not
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
the
federal
forum,
in
this
particular
instance,
is
all-important.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
involving
fourth
amendment;
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
i'm
not
saying
it
was
not
a
federal
forum.
it's
clearly
a
federal
forum,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
it
is
not
a
federal
forum
that
this
particular
man
would
have
to
necessarily
choose.
one
problem
that
may
arise
with
exercising
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court,
it's
quite
possible
that
a
pro
se
matter
may
involve
a
period
of
time
and
the
civil
rights
action
could
actually...
maybe
the
statute
of
limitations
would
preclude
it.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
under
the
issue
we're
asking
the
court
to
decide,
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
shank
no,
sir.
