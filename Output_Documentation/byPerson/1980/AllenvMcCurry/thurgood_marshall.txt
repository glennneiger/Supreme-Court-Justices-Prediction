marshall
how
can
you
assume
that
counsel,
that
the
client
wouldn't
tell
the
counsel
he
had
a
case
pending?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
assume
that
he
would
not
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that
they
don't
want
to
tell
the
truth
but
i
mean--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--don't
you
think
that
counsel
was
obliged
to
tell
the
federal
court
that
we
have
another
case
pending
in
the
state
court?
don't
you
think
that
was
a
duty
upon
the
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
stayed
that
in
that
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
isn't
that
a
duty
of
counsel
to
tell
the
court
that
some
other
court
is
hearing
this
same
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
court.
don't
you
think
that's
a
duty
to
tell
the
court
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know...
but
i'm
talking
about
the
relationship
between
client
and
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you'd
lead
the
court
to
a
position
where
it
would
have
two
courses
with
contrary
rulings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you'd
be
responsible
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
couldn't
abstain
if
they
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
whose
duty
was
it
to
notify
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
wasn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
saying
it
about
you
because
i
knew
you
weren't
there.
