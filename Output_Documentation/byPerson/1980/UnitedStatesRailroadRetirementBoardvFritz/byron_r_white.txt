justice
white
does
the
class
include
people
who
had
already
retired
and
were
eligible
for
the
so-called
double-dipping
benefits?
justice
white
but,
as
the
result
of
the
judgment
that
that
exception
is
unconstitutional
also,
or
not?
justice
white
so
are
you...
well,
i'll
put
it
to
you
this
way,
are
you
attempting
to
justify
a
difference
between
that
group
and
the
other
groups,
or
do
you
think
that
group
is
just
out
of
the
case?
justice
white
must
you
defend
that
particular
group,
though,
that
particular
exception?
justice
white
people
who
have
already
retired
and
are--
justice
white
--but
is
the
issue
here
or
not,
that
issue?
justice
white
then
you...
and
you
do
purport
to
defend
that
distinction?
justice
white
--well,
does
it
encourage
anybody
to
return
to
the
railroad
industry?
justice
white
so
this
is
sort
of...
has
a
counter
influence
as
far
as
opening
up
positions
in
the
railroad
industry?
it
brings
people
back
to
it,
older
people
back
to
it?
justice
white
but
while
they're
there
there's
no
vacancy?
justice
white
or
a
vacancy
was
filled?
justice
white
what
standard
do
you
think
we
have...
judging
this
case
by?
do
you
think
you've
finished
your
case
when
you
say,
here
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish?
here's
what
they
did,
(a),
(b),
and
this
is
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
by
it?
justice
white
none
of
them
included
dissolvency
or
did
all
of
them?
did...
was
one
of
the
purposes
to
make
the
fund
solvent,
or
to
keep
it
solvent?
justice
white
would
that
have
been
a...
would
that
always
be
enough?
justice
white
like,
every
other
name
in
the
phone
book?
justice
white
you're
not
suggesting
the
act
doesn't,
shouldn't
be
read
as
doing
what
the
district
court
said
was
unconstitutional?
justice
white
well,
you...
the
act
did
hurt
your
client?
justice
white
there's
no
question
that
on
its
face
it
does.
justice
white
you're
not
suggesting
construing
it
otherwise?
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
this
is
what
the
act
does.
justice
white
and
it
does
that,
and
the
question
is
whether...
let's
just
assume
there
wasn't
a
fragment
of
legislative
history.
i
suppose
you
would...
you
still
have
the
problem
of
saying
that
it's
irrational.
justice
white
why?
which
is
irrational?
the
act
isn't.
maybe
the,
maybe
somebody's
statement
about
what
the
purposes
were
is
erroneous.
justice
white
congress
did
it
twice.
justice
white
congress
did
what
you
say
it
really
didn't
intend
to
do
twice.
justice
white
both
by
two-thirds
vote.
justice
white
after
the
president
says,
you
really
don't
understand
what
you're
doing,
they
said,
we
understand
perfectly
what
the
act
says,
and
passed
it
and
overruled
his
veto.
justice
white
let
me
ask
you...
approach
it
another...
suppose
it
was
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
do
what
the
act
says
on
its
face
and
suppose...
i
suppose
you
would
still
be
here
arguing
that
it
was
irrational.
justice
white
aren't
these
really
the...
isn't
this
really
what
you
have
to
win
on
here
if
you're
going
to
win?
justice
white
would
you
still
be
here
if
they...
if
the
law
had
been
changed
so
as
to
destroy
all
of
the
windfalls?
justice
white
suppose
all
vested
benefits
had
been
terminated?
justice
white
well,
you'd
have
quite
a
different
class.
justice
white
so
this
reliance
business,
that
doesn't
carry
the
day,
does
it?
justice
white
the
fact
of
vesting
in
reliance,
in
that
statement
in
the
pamphlet?
justice
white
but
it
wouldn't
if
they'd--
justice
white
--if
they'd
really
been
mean
about
it,
it
wouldn't.
justice
white
--you'd
have
a
tough
case.
justice
white
but
you'd
have
a
tough
case.
