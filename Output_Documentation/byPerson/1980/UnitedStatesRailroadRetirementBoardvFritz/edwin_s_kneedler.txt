mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
the
district
court
held
that
section
3(h)(1)
of
the
railroad
retirement
act
of
1974
is
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause.
the
court
rested
this
holding
on
its
conclusion
that
congress
had
no
rational
basis
for
excluding
members
of
a
certified
class
in
this
case
for
eligibility
for
the
special
benefit
provided
under
that
section.
the
railroad
retirement
act
provides
a
system
of
retirement
disability
and
survivor
benefits
for
persons
who
pursue
careers
in
the
railroad
industry,
just
as
the
social
security
act
provides
these
benefits
for
persons
who
pursue
careers
in
other
industries.
indeed,
this
court
observed
in
1963
in
eichel
v.
new
york
central
railroad
company,
quoting
a
lower
court
decision,
that
the
railroad
retirement
act
is
substantially
a
social
security
act
for
employees
of
common
carriers.
railroad
retirement
and
social
security
have
been
separate
systems
since
their
inception
in
the
1930s
but
over
the
years
they
have
been
integrated
in
many
respects.
congress
integrated
the
two
programs
even
further
when
it
thoroughly
revised
the
railroad
retirement
act
in
1974.
section
3(h)(1)
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
product
of
these
further
efforts
at
integration.
that
section
limits
eligibility
for
what
congress
perceived
to
be
a
windfall
accruing
to
certain
persons
who
were
eligible
to
receive
both
social
security
and
railroad
retirement
benefits
under
prior
law.
because
the
relationship
between
social
security
and
railroad
retirement
provides
important
background
for
addressing
the
issues
presented
in
this
case,
i
would
first
like
to
briefly
describe
that
relationship
and
the
origins
of
section
3(h)(1).
i
will
then
explain
appellee's
constitutional
challenge
to
section
3(h)(1)
in
this
case.
railroad
retirement
benefits
are
paid
out
of
a
railroad
retirement
account
established
in
the
treasury
and
financed
by
payroll
taxes
imposed
on
carriers
and
their
employees.
in
1951
congress
instituted
a
financial
interchange
between
this
railroad
retirement
account
and
the
social
security
trust
fund,
which
was
designed
to
place
the
trust
fund
in
exactly
the
position
it
would
have
been
in
if
railroad
work
had
been
covered
by
the
social
security
act.
under
this
financial
interchange,
funds
are
transferred
each
year
from
the
railroad
retirement
account
to
the
trust
fund
in
amount
equal
to
the
taxes
the
carriers
and
their
employees
would
have
paid
if
they'd
been
covered
by
social
security.
in
return
funds
are
transferred
back
from
the
trust
fund
to
the
account
in
amount
equal
to
the
benefits
that
would
have
been
paid
to
retired
railroad
workers,
their
survivors,
and
dependents,
if
railroad
work
had
been
covered
by
the
social
security
act.
the
effect
of
this
arrangement
was
to
provide
a
type
of
reinsurance
for
the
railroad
retirement
system.
however,
it
became
increasingly
apparent
in
the
years
following
1951
that
this
arrangement
did
not
have
the
desired
effect
in
the
case
of
employees
who
were
entitled
to
receive
both
social
security
and
railroad
retirement
benefits,
perhaps
as
a
result
of
having
split
their
careers
between
work
covered
by
the
one
act
and
work
covered
by
the
other
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but...
yes;
yes.
well,
one
exception
might
be
where
a
person
was
working
full
time
in
the
railroad
industry
and
had
moonlighted,
in
effect,
in
a
social
security
job.
i
suppose
that's
splitting--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
this...
the
problem
resulted
because
under
the
financial
interchange
program,
whenever
a
retired
railroad
worker
received
social
security
benefits
directly
from
the
trust
fund,
the
reinsurance
payment
from
the
trust
fund
to
the
railroad
retirement
account
was
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
social
security
benefits.
the
result
was
a
shortfall
in
the
income
to
the
account
necessary
to
pay
the
railroad
retirement
benefits.
but
despite
this
shortfall,
the
individual
beneficiary
for
whom
that
reduction
was
made
remained
eligible
to
receive
his
full
railroad
retirement
annuity.
this
shortfall
therefore
resulted
in
a
substantial
and
accelerating
drain
on
the
assets
in
the
railroad
retirement
account
and
was
a
substantial
cause
of
the
serious
financial
position
of
the
account
by
the
last
1960s.
aside--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
this
court
held
in
flemming
v.
nestor
that
social
security
benefits
are
noncontractual
and
that
congress
may
alter
or
even
eliminate
them
at
any
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
exactly,
and
two
terms
ago,
in
this
court's
decision
in
hisquierdo
v.
hisquierdo,
the
court
applied
this
same
understanding
to
the
railroad
retirement
act.
aside
from
the
financial
difficulties
that
these
dual
benefits
created,
it
was
also
perceived
by
the
late
1960s
that
the
payment
of
dual
benefits
was
inequitable
because
a
person
who
split
his
career
between
railroad
and
nonrailroad
work
received
more
in
combined
benefits
than
a
person
would
receive
if
he
had
spent
his
entire
career
in
an
industry
covered
by
just
one
act
or
the
other.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
is,
and
the
reports
on
the
1974
legislation
do
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
problem
of
overlapping
benefits
does
arise
in
several
different
situations
and
there
is
no
deduction
in
the
manner
of
this
case
in
those
other
situations.
but
the
distinction
that
was
perceived
here,
in
the
committee
reports
was
that
the
railroad
retirement
system
is
different
because
it
was
really
designed
as
a
social
security
system,
a
parallel
program,
and
there
was
a
financial
interchange
between
the
two
that
does
not
occur,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
military
retirement
or
federal
civil
service
retirement.
and
in
addition,
in
those
cases,
in
federal
civil
service
and
military,
the
government
stands
as
employer
to
the
persons
who
were
receiving
the
benefit.
here,
in
this
case,
the
government
is
using
its
taxing
and
spending
power,
or
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
in
collecting
revenues
and
paying
benefits
in
the
private
sector.
so
these
differences,
i
think,
serve
to
distinguish
why
congress
took
the
first
step
in
integrating
the
two
programs
under
the
railroad
retirement
act.
against
this
background
congress
sought
in
the
1974
act
to
integrate
the
two
programs
further
and
to
phase
out
the
windfall
that
was
perceived
to
result
from
the
receipt
of
dual
benefits.
first,
congress
divided
up
the
basic
railroad
retirement
benefit
that
had
been
paid
under
prior
law
into
two
components
which
were
discussed
in
this
court,
by
this
court,
in
hisquierdo
two
terms
ago.
the
lower
tier
of
those
benefits
is
exactly
comparable
to
what
the
person
would
receive
under
the
social
security
act.
the
upper
tier
is
smaller
in
amount
and
computed
solely
on
the
basis
of
railroad
work.
in
order
to
eliminate
the
dual
benefit
problem,
however,
congress
provided
that
the
first
tier
of
benefits,
the
one
that
corresponds
to
social
security,
would
be
reduced
whenever
the
retired
railroad
worker
received
social
security
benefits
directly
from
the
trust
fund.
this
eliminated
the
windfall,
it
eliminated
the
drain
on
the
railroad
retirement
account,
and
it
also
had
the
effect
of
passing
through
to
the
individual
beneficiary
the
reduction
that
had
been
made
in
the
reinsurance
payment
because
of
the
receipt
of
social
security
benefits.
although
these
changes
were
designed
to
eliminate
the
dual
benefit
problem
in
the
future,
congress
did
include
or
carry
forward
in
the
1974
act
certain
transitional
provisions
to
preserve
this
windfall
element
for
certain
people
who
may
have
been
eligible
to
receive
benefits
under
both
acts
prior
to
1974.
this
transitional
or
3(h)
of
the
act,
the
section
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
section
3(h)
provides
yet
a
third
tier
of
benefits
under
the
railroad
retirement
act
for
certain
of
the
persons
whose
first
tier
was
reduced
because
they
were
receiving
dual
benefits.
thus,
in
effect,
the
third
tier
adds
back
what
was
taken
away
under
the
first
tier,
and
the
effect
is
to
isolate
in
a
separate
section
and
as
a
separate
benefit
that
portion
of
the
combined
social
security
and
railroad
retirement
benefits
that
congress
had
perceived
to
be
a
windfall
or
an
overlap
under
prior
law,
and
the
act
limits
the
eligibility
for
these
benefits
to
certain
individuals
who
may
have
been
eligible,
who
would
have
been
eligible
to
receive
these
dual
benefits
under
prior
law.
first
of
all,
everyone
who
is
retired
and
already
receiving
benefits
under
both
programs
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
december
31,
1974,
may
continue
to
receive
benefits
under
both
programs,
including
the
windfall
element,
although
this
windfall
element
is
not
increased
with
the
cost
of
living
over
time.
it's
frozen
from
the
date
of
retirement.
for
persons
who
were
not
yet
retired
in
1974,
however,
the
standards
for
determining
eligibility
for
being
protected
under
the
grandfather
provisions
depend
on
whether
the
person
was...
in
general,
on
whether
the
person
was
affiliated
with
the
railroad
industry
in
1974
or
whether
he
had
left
the
industry
and
had
started
to
pursue
other
work.
employees
who
were
still
working
in
the
railroad
industry
in
1974
or
had
what
the
act
terms
12
out
of
the
preceding
30
months...
the
two
of
them
together
i
would
call
an
affiliation
with
the
railroad
industry...
those
persons
are
eligible
to
receive
this
transitional
windfall
benefit
if
they
had
completed
the
necessary
ten
years
of
railroad
retirement
and
the
necessary
amount
of
social
security
work,
ordinarily
40
quarters,
to
complete
the
eligibility
requirements
under
both
acts
by
december
31,
1974,
when
congress
changed
the
law.
in
addition
to
these
persons
who
still
had
an
affiliation
with
the
industry,
congress
also
included
in
this
category
long-term
employees
who
had
25
years
of
railroad
service
even
though
they
may
have
left
railroad
work
when
the
1974
act
went
into
effect.
persons
who
had
left
railroad
work
before
1974
but
did
not
have
the
25
years
of
eligibility
were
treated
differently
under
the
act.
they
could
receive
a
windfall
element
only
if
they
had
satisfied
the
length
of
service
requirements
under
both
acts
when
they
left
railroad
work.
and
the
amount
they
received
is
somewhat
smaller.
it's
under
section
3(h)(2)
of
the
act.
it's
smaller
because
the
amount
of
the
benefit
is
calculated
on
the
basis
of
what
they
expected
to
receive
when
they
left
railroad
work,
as
opposed
to
later,
in
1974.
thus,
if
a
person
left
railroad
work
in
1966,
for
example,
and
had
ten
years
of
railroad
work
but
had
not
yet
work
40
quarters
in
social
security,
he
would
not
be
eligible
under
the
act
to
receive
any
windfall
or
carryover
benefit
because
it
was
not
until
later
that
he
became
qualified
to
receive
social
security
benefits.
the
present
case,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
these
qualification
provisions
in
section
3(h)(1)
was
filed
in
1976.
i
believe
fritz
was
the
representative
of
the
certified
class
of
beneficiaries
under
the
act
who
had
become
eligible
to
retire
after
1974
when
the
act
went
into
effect,
but
before
january
of
1977.
that
happened
to
be
the
span
the
court
defined.
persons
who
were
eligible
to
retire
but
were
not
eligible
to
receive
the
windfall
benefit
because
they
had
not
either
been
affiliated
with
the
railroad
industry
in
1974
or
had
not
completed
the
necessary
qualifications
under
both
acts
in
whatever
earlier
year
they
may
have
left
the
railroad
industry.
at
least...
yes,
sir?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
have
been
bills
introduced
in
each
of
the
three...
i
guess,
the
last
two
congresses,
and
those
bills
have
not
been
enacted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
have
not
been
reported
out
of
committee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
he
worked
only
under
one
act
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
right.
if
he
worked
under
one
act...
in
other
words,
the
reduction
or
the
exclusion
from
eligibility
for
the
windfall
element
puts
him
in
the
same
position
as
if
he
had
worked
under
only
one
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
of
labor-management
connivance
in...
i
think
a
reading
of
the
minutes
of
the
negotiating
sessions,
for
example,
demonstrate
that
the
parties,
as
is
typical
in
negotiating
something
such
as
this...
there's
a
certain
amount
of
give
and
take,
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
i
have
found
that
this
is
motivated
by
some
animus
toward
persons
who
had
left
the
railroad
industry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
doesn't,
because
they
may
receive
the
equivalent
of
the
full
benefits
they
expected
to
receive
under
prior
law,
so
it's
not
increased
over
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
unclear
from
the
judgment.
the
judgment...
the
district
court's
opinion
appears
to
find
an
irrational
distinction
only
on
the
basis
of
those
people
who
were
affiliated
with
the
industry
in
'74
and
those
who
were
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think...
i
think
there
are
degrees...
congress
was
drafting
a
grandfather
clause
here,
and
there
are
degrees
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
perhaps
that
exception
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
perhaps
the
strongest--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
believe
that
issue
is
here,
no,
because
the
district
court
perceived
the
inequity
to
be
only
the
difference
between
those
who
qualified
who
were
not
retired
but
were
in
the
railroad
industry
in
'74.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
would
receive
it
if
he
had
completed
those
40
quarters
and
the
ten
years
of
railroad
service
in
the
year
that
he
left
the
railroad
industry.
in
other
words,
what
the
act
does
is
lock
at
your
affiliation
with
the
industry:
did
you
become
qualified
when
you
were
still
affiliated
with
the
industry,
either
in
'74...
for
those
people
who
were
in
the
industry
when
the
act
was
passed...
or
in
an
earlier
year
when
they
were
affiliated,
the
last
year
in
which
they
were
affiliated
with
the
industry,
if
they
left
before
that
time?
so,
what
in
effect
the
act
does
is
protect
only
those
dual
benefits
that
were
earned
while
the
person
was
still
in
the
industry,
not
those
of
somebody
who
left
and
then
earned
the
right
to
dual
benefits
by
taking
on
social
security
work.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
it
doesn't
matter
who
gets
it
first,
if
the
person
who
was
qualified
under
both
in
1966,
he
would
get
this
windfall--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--only
if...
this
is
only
true
if
1966
is
his
last
year
of
railroad
work.
that's
what
you're
looking
at.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so
that's
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--okay.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
1966?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
he
would
not
be
eligible,
because
he'd--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
because
what...
essentially
what
congress
did
was
preserve
the
benefits
that...
the
larger
benefits
under
section
3(h)(1)
are
for
those
who
were
still
affiliated
with
the
industry
in
1974
and
those
who
had
25
years
of
service.
congress...
the
reports
on
the
bill
say
that
these
people
had
the
strongest
equities
and
the
report
submissions
by
the
joint
committee
for
labor
and
management
said
that
this...
indicated
that
this
equity
was
because
they
still
had
an
attachment,
affinity
for
the
industry.
but
congress
did
not
totally
exclude
the
possibility
of
eligibility
for
people
who
left
before
1974.
it
simply
dealt
with
them
under
a
different
section,
and
said
they
too
can
be
eligible
as
long
as
they
accrued
their
entitlement
to
dual
benefits
when
they
were
still
in
the
railroad
industry.
if
they
left
and
then
went
out
and
did
their
social
security
work
afterward,
then
they
did
not
accrue
their
dual
benefits
while
they
were
still
in
the
industry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right;
that's
right.
because
he
comes,
because
he
came
back
in
1974.
the
distinction
drawn
here
furthers
a
number
of
the
statutory
purposes
of
the
act,
and
since
this
does
not,
since
this
act
does
not
exclude
on
the
basis
of
a
suspect
category,
or
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
sufficient
that
the
category
be
rationally
related
to
legitimate
government
purposes.
now,
first,
this
court
stated
in
hisquierdo
two
terms
ago,
citing
the
committee
reports
on
the
act
in
the
1930s,
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
provide
retirement
benefits
for
persons
who
were
pursuing
careers
in
the
railroad
industry,
and
so
to
provide
them
with
the
opportunity
to
live
out
the
closing
years
of
their
life
in
comfort.
well,
the
line
drawn
under
section
3(h)(1)
accomplishes
this
purpose
because
when
the
act
was
passed
the
persons
who
were
pursuing
their
careers
in
the
railroad
industry
were
those
who
were
still
affiliated
with
it,
or
people
who
had
spent
25
years
in
the
industry
by
that
time
had
pursued
the
major
portion
of
their
careers
in
the
industry.
the
other
people
who
had
left
the
industry
were
pursuing
their
careers
elsewhere.
second,
in
a
related
purpose
of
the
act,
which
was
also
identified
in
hisquierdo,
was
to
provide
an
incentive
for
older
workers
to
retire
and
thereby
to
open
up
more
job
opportunities
for
younger
workers
and
more
rapid
advancement.
section
3(h)(1)
is
consistent
with
this
purpose
as
well,
because
it
is
only
necessary
to
provide
an
incentive
to
retire
for
people
who
are
still
in
the
railroad
industry.
for
people
who
have
left
there
would
be
no...
even
if
the
windfall
benefit
was
an
incremental
incentive
to
retire,
their
retirement
would
not
open
up
jobs
for
younger
workers.
the
third
purpose
that
is
served
is
the
one
that
i
previously
mentioned
and
one
that's
furthered
by
any
grandfather
provision,
and
that
is
trying
to
accommodate
the
equities
if
persons
who
may
have
been
affected
by
a
change
in
the
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
act
does
provide
that
if
a
person
returns
to
the
industry
after
1974
and
had
a
current
connection
with
the
industry
when
he
retired,
then
he
is
also
eligible
to
receive
a
windfall
benefit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
they
came
back
in
the
industry
they
would
be
eligible
for
the
windfall
benefit
which
would
then
create
an
incentive
for
them
to
retire,
so
even
if
they
did
come
back,
it
creates
an
incentive
for
them
to
retire
and
therefore
actually
furthers
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
there
is
no
vacancy.
that's
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
of
course,
in
some
of
these
cases
the
person
who
came
back
may
have
been
someone
who
was
laid
off
or
had
been
laid
off
for
a
fair
amount
of
time,
or
his
former
railroad
employer
went
out
of
business,
something
of
that
nature.
and
so,
when
he
came
back,
his
equities
might
be
quite
strong
because
the
act
still
requires
that
he
have
completed
his
ten
years
of
railroad
service
and
his
social
security
service
before
1974.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
do.
congress,
for
the
reasons
i've
explained,
clearly
had
substantial
reasons
for
doing
what
it
did,
and
under
this
court's
decision--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
by
all
means,
and
to
exclude
certain
people,
to
narrow
the
class
of
people
who
were
going
to
continue
to
receive
dual
benefits.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
believe
that
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
long
as
congress
did
it
with
some
rational
approach.
i
suppose
it
couldn't
take
every
other
name
and
give
it
to
every
other
name,
and
not
to
the
other
persons,
but
congress
certainly
did
it
in
an
ordered
fashion.
and
the
rational
basis
approach
i've
suggested
is
particularly
appropriate
in
a
case
like
this
because
the
benefit
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
one
that
was
designed
to
meet
an
identifiable
need
that
congress
saw
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiaries,
as
is
the
case
with
most
welfare
or
social
security
benefits,
or
even
most
benefits
under
the
railroad
retirement
act.
this
benefit
was
a
conceded
anomaly
that
occurred
under
prior
law
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
congress
decided
to
have
two
parallel
social
security-type
programs
rather
than
combining
them
into
one
comprehensive
program.
so,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
eliminating
the
benefit
in
the
future
for
any
category
of
persons
can
be
presumed
to
have
denied
them
of
a
benefit
tailored
to
satisfying
particular
needs.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
on
the
basis
of
your
hypothetical,
you
said,
for
two
weeks
before?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the
person
who
was
the
two
weeks--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
1970?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in...
if
they
retired
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
if
they
retired
before
1974,
they
retain
their
full--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
retain
the
windfall
element.
this
only
affects
persons
who
retire
after
the
effective
date
of
the
1974
act,
people
who
are
not
yet
retired.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
no;
it
depends
on
which
industry
he
was
in
in
1974.
if
he
was
in
the
railroad
industry
in
1974,
he
gets
the
windfall
element.
if
he
was
not
in
the
industry
in
1974
but
he
comes
back
to
the
industry
and
retires
from
railroad
work,
he
gets
the
windfall
benefit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
in
a
statute
such
as
this
any
eligibility
criterion
involves
questions
of
line-drawing
where
people
on
one
side
of
it
have
what
may
appear
to
be
almost
as
strong
equity
as
those
people
on
the
other
side.
the
congress
has
to
deal
in
categories
of
persons
in
a
vast
program
like
this
and
the
categories
drawn
here
are
based
on
reasonable
grounds.
no
further
questions?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
just
several
points
i
wanted
to
make.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
beyond
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
of
the
act
to
determine
that
the
appellee
class
was
excluded,
but
if
it
were,
the
committee
reports
on
page
12
of
each
report
could
not
be
clearer.
they
both
say
it
in
identical
language,
'74...
they
would
not
receive
a
dual
benefit
upon
retirement
unless
they
also
had
fully
qualified
under
social
security
by
the
close
of
the
year
prior
to
'75
in
which
they
left
railroad
service.
if
they
had
so
qualified
under
both
systems
at
that
point,
however,
they
would
receive
dual
benefits.
so
congress
plainly
knew
what
it
was
doing.
secondly,
appellee
suggests
that
all,
that
congress
really
had
to
take
an
all-or-nothing
approach.
it
either
had
to
wipe
out
what
he
refers
to
as
vested
benefits,
which
i
think
are
more
properly
referred
to
as
an
expectation
of
receiving
benefits
under
prior
law.
congress
had
the
choice
of
either
wiping
them
all
out
of
wiping
none
of
them
out,
and
could
not
take
a
middle
course.
the
congress
was
faced
with
a
serious
financial
problem
in
the
railroad
retirement
account.
and
congress
tried
to
accommodate
the
financial
needs
of
the
system
against
what
are
inevitably
degrees
of
equity
among
people
who
may
have
had
expectations
under
prior
law.
the
concept
of
reliance
really
has
no
basis
here,
because
as
was
pointed
out
in
hisquierdo
these
benefits
are
not
contractual.
railroad
retirement
is
a
direct
parallel
of
social
security,
and
this
court
made
clear
in
flemming
that
congress
can
change
those.
anyone
who
was,
who
had
enough--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
it's...
yes
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
persons
could
have
done
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes,
but
not
in
the...
i
mean,
the
purpose
is
to...
is...
talk
about
early
retirement.
it
suggests
going
on
the
retirement
rolls.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
by
retiring.
i
mean,
that's
what
the
railroad
retirement
act
is
directed
at,
in
this
context,
is
retiring.
easily...
what
you're
referring
to
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
it
is...
i
mean,
it's
conceivable
that
there
could
be
people
who
did
that,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
considerable
leap
to
say
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
concede
that
that
would
be
the
majority
of
the
persons
in
the
class.
and
congress
can,
i
think,
legislate
on
the
basis
of
what
it
could
presume
to
be
the
characteristics
of
the
class
as
a
whole
rather
than,
rather
than
in
certain
individual
cases.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
may
have
had
an
expectation
but
in
terms
of
that
being
the
motivating
factor
for
his
leaving
the
railroad
industry,
i
think
that
i
don't
really
know--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i...
of
course,
i
think
that
just
goes
back
to
whether
he
had
an
expectation
under
prior
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
