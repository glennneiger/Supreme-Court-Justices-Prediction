justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
byron,
how
can
you
say
that
when
in
fact
it's
conceded
that
the
legislation
if
read
according
to
its
meaning
has
the
effect
that
you
claim
is
unconstitutional?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
railroad
board
isn't
vested
with
the
legislative
power
of
the
united
states,
it's
congress.
justice
rehnquist
what
better
source
is
there
than
the
statute
itself
for
finding
out
what
congress
wanted
it
to
do?
justice
rehnquist
you
say
they
would
override
the
express
declaration...
the
enacted
legislation
would?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
byron,
following
up
on
my
brother
marshall's
question,
you've
referred
several
times
to
the
statement
of
primary
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
rehnquist
where
does
one
find
that?
i've
looked
in
the
u.s.
code
and
i've
looked
in
the
statutes
at
large.
is
it
a
part
of
the
enacted
legislation?
justice
rehnquist
oh,
is
it...
it's
not
a
statement
of
purposes
contained
in
the
legislation
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana
held
unconstitutional
a
section
of
the
railroad
retirement
act
of
1974
and
the
united
states
railroad
retirement
board
has
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
the
1974
act
fundamentally
restructured
the
railroad
retirements
system
by
eliminating
certain
retirement
benefits.
under
the
earlier
system
of
person
who
worked
for
both
railroads
and
nonrailroads
and
who
qualified
for
both
railroad
retirement
benefits
and
social
security
benefits
was
entitled
to
receive
retirement
benefit
from
both
systems
and
an
accompanying
windfall
benefit.
in
1974,
congress
determined
that
the
payment
of
these
windfall
benefits
threatened
the
financial
solvency
of
the
railroad
retirement
system
and
decided
to
eliminate
the
benefits
for
a
certain
classes
of
employees.
thus,
under
section
231
of
the
act,
some
classes
of
employees
such
as
those
who
had
already
retired
or
those
who
had
not
yet
retired
but
who
had
25
years
of
railroad
experience
continued
to
receive
benefits
under
the
old
system
and
employees
who
were
actually
employed
in
the
railroad
industry
in
1974
could
have
also
received
the
windfall
benefits.
but
because
appellee,
fritz,
and
his
class
members
were
not
employed
in
the
railroad
industry
in
1974,
they
failed
to
qualify
for
the
old
windfall
benefit.
fritz
thus
brought
suit
claiming
that
section
231
was
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
irrationally
distinguished
between
classes
of
employees.
fritz
argued
that
it
was
arbitrary
of
congress
to
deprive
him
of
--
his
benefits
simply
because
he
was
not
active
in
the
railroad
industry
in
1974.
the
district
court
agreed
with
fritz
and
held
section
231
unconstitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
find
that
congress'
action
in
excluding
fritz
and
his
class
members
was
not
irrational
or
arbitrary.
this
court
has
judicially
deferred
to
the
wisdom
of
the
congress’
welfare
--
congress’
judgment
and
social
welfare
o0r
economic
legislation.
we
will
not
strike
down
the
act
of
congress
simply
because
we
deem
it
unwise
or
would
have
drawn
or
cut
off
benefits
in
--
at
some
other
point
than
congress
did.
in
this
case,
congress
could
have
eliminated
all
retirement
benefits
if
it's
so
desired.
the
classification
of
employees
here
is
not
arbitrary
because
congress
concluded
that
employees
other
than
fritz
had
a
greater
equitable
claim
for
the
windfall
benefits.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
brennan
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
joins
has
filed
an
opinion
in
dissent.
