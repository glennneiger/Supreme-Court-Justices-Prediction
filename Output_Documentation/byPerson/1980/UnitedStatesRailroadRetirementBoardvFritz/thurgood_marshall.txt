mr.
byron,
who
misled
congress?
you
say
that
the
board
determined
this,
someone
else
determined
something,
and
you
determined
that
135
people
didn't
understand
that?
justice
marshall
who
misled
them?
justice
marshall
in
your
opinion?
in
what
record
can
you
point
to
your
opinion?
or
is
this
your
gut
reaction?
justice
marshall
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
congress
was
misled?
justice
marshall
and
then
can't
you
oblige
and
say
by
whom
or
by
what?
justice
marshall
who
got
them
to
do
that?
justice
marshall
what
did
hisquierdo
case
say
about
that
contract
you've
been
talking
about,
that
pamphlet?
justice
marshall
it
said
it
wasn't
contractual,
didn't
it?
justice
marshall
well,
where
do
you
get
a
contract?
justice
marshall
but
you
are
arguing
contract?
justice
marshall
i'd
be
very
interested--
justice
marshall
--i'd
be
interested
if
you'd
give
me
one
that
was
a
majority
opinion.
