justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
you
described
as
the
people
who
were
not
entitled
to
participate
in
the
windfall
benefit,
you
gave
an
example
of
the
person
who
had
ten
years
of
railroad
service
and
less
than
40
quarters
of
social
security.
i
had
understood...
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
this...
that
if
a
person
had
ten
years
of
railroad
service
and
40
quarters
of
social
security
service,
but
no
1974
connection,
he
would
also
not
receive
the
windfall
benefit.
justice
stevens
i
see.
so
that
if
you
have
a
person
who
in
1966
had
ten
years
of
service
in
both
industries,
but
one
of
them
got
the
ten
years
social
security
service
first
and
the
other
one
got
the
ten
years
railroad
retirement
service
first,
railroad
service
first,
one
would
get
the
dual
benefit
and
the
other
would
not.
justice
stevens
and
if
1966
marked
his
tenth
year
of
non-railroad
work,
he
would
not
get
it,
but
if
it
marked
his
tenth
year
of
railroad
work
he
would
get
it?
justice
stevens
i
mean...
well,
no.
justice
stevens
in
one
example,
the
last
year
was
1965,
say,
and
then--
justice
stevens
--he
did
his
tenth
year
of--
justice
stevens
--yes.
justice
stevens
if
he
did
it
just
the
converse,
railroad
work,
last
year
1965,
social
security
work,
last
year
1966,
he
does
not
get
it?
justice
stevens
but
if
the
other...
if
the
'65
and
'66
are
transposed,
he
does
get
it?
justice
stevens
if
a
person
who
had
ten
years
of...
would
qualify
the
way
i
described
a
moment
ago,
in
addition
had
a
current
connection
in
1974,
would
that
increase
his
benefit?
increase
his
dual
benefit?
justice
stevens
he
wouldn't
have...
i
see,
he
couldn't
have
retired
from
the
railroad
industry
under
that
hypothesis
because--
justice
stevens
i
have
one
further
question,
counsel.
supposing
we've
got
two
men
who
both
retired
age
65,
on
their
65th
birthday.
and
each
of
them
has
worked
ten
years
in
the
railroad
industry,
and
ten
years
in
social
security
work,
but
not
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
one
of
them
for
the
two
weeks
before
he
retired
was
a
railroad
man
and
the
other
one
for
the
two
weeks
before
he
retired
was
a
non-railroad
man.
one
gets
the
double
benefit
and
the
other
does
not.
explain
how
that's
rational.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
they
both
retired
in
1970,
at
their
65th
birthday.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
if
in
my
example,
then,
one
of
them
continues
to,
doesn't...
actually
retires
later
on,
it
depends
on
which
industry
he's
in
when
he
retires?
justice
stevens
yes.
while
missing
the
very...
qualifying
for
social
security
in
the
first
place,
you
have
to
have
worked
for...
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
certain
number
of
quarters
or
a
number
of
years
and
made
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
money,
and
i
suppose
there
are
some
people
who
come
awfully
close
but
just
don't
make
it.
justice
stevens
mr.
byron,
are
you
arguing...
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
that
any
cutback
that
didn't
either
exclude
all
vested
benefits
or
no
vested
benefits
would
have
been
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
but
is...
well,
the
presentation
to
congress
was,
we're
going
to
preserve
all
vested
benefits,
and
you
seem
to
place
great
emphasis
on
the
vesting
concept.
justice
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
but
as
soon
as
you
admit
that
congress
could
have
constitutionally
cut
back
on
some
of
the
vested
benefits,
it
seems
to
me
your
whole
argument
is
beside
the
point,
the
only
argument
you've
made
thus
far,
is
beside
the
point.
justice
stevens
and
that
the
goal
you're
relying
on
is
the
goal
to
preserve
all
vested
benefits.
justice
stevens
any
cutback
on
that
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
that
goal.
justice
stevens
mr.
byron,
isn't
it
true
that
in
a
lot
of
pension
situations
a
person
who
retires
with
20
years
of
service
in
1974
will
get
a
higher
pension
than
someone
who
retired
with
20
years
of
service
in
1970,
say,
simply
because
there's
been
a
decision
to
increase
benefits;
and
therefore
the
timing
of
the
date
of
retirement
has
a
rational...
provides
a
rational
explanation
for
why
you
get
a
higher
benefit?
justice
stevens
but
would
that
be
irrational?
say
there's
inflation
and
say
that
people
amend
their
plan
in
1974
and
say
that
from
here
on
people
who
have
25
years
of
service
will
get
a
greater
benefit
than
they
used
to
get,
than
the
people
used
to
get
who
retired
two
years
ago?
isn't
that
all
that's
really
happened
here?
because
you're
just
saying
the
railroad
service
is
the
more
valuable
benefit,
more
valuable
criterion
for
eligibility,
and
that
happens
to
come
later.
therefore,
you
get
a
higher
benefit.
justice
stevens
put
the
vesting
concept
to
one
side.
i
understand
you
are
objecting
to
the
vesting.
but
if
there
have
been
no
vesting
here,
would
my
hypothetical
be
any
different?
justice
stevens
mr.
byron,
could
you
give
me
an
example
so
i'll
understand
it
better
of
a
man
who
could
have
made
a
different
choice
in
the
past
and
qualified?
justice
stevens
well,
they
didn't
lose
the
railroad
benefit
that
it
vested.
justice
stevens
and
they
did
get
the
social
security...
what
did
they...
and
they
did
get
additional
benefits
by
additional
work
in
the
social
security
program,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
we're
talking,
you're
talking
about
the
choice,
that
he
was
kind
of
misled.
justice
stevens
and
it
is
true
that
at
the
time
he
left
railroad
service
he
knew
he
was
going
to
get
a
lesser
benefit,
or
did
he?
i'm
trying
to
place--
justice
stevens
--is
the
railroad
service
always
more--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
i
understand
the
legal
argument
based
on
flemming.
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
the
practical
argument
your
opponent
makes
about
a
man
not
being
able
to
live
his
life
over
again.
is
it
correct
that
in,
say,
1955,
a
man
who
had
ten
years
of
railroad
service
and
therefore
had
vested
rights
under
that
service
could
have
been
motivated
to
retire
from
railroad
service
with
the
expectation
that
he
would
supplement
his
retirement
income
by
earning
social
security
benefits
which
congress
has
now
taken
away
from
him?
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
well,
he
would
have
been
carrying
out
the
purpose
of
the
railroad
retirement
act
when
he
did
it,
because
part
of
the
purpose
was
to
encourage
early
retirement.
justice
stevens
or
getting
out
of
the
railroad
business.
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
their
purpose
to
go
to
work
as,
say,
a
milkman
or
a
baker
driver
or
something
else,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
so
that
these
people
that
i
am
discussing
in
my
hypothetical
did
fulfill
the
purpose
of
retirement,
whole
retirement
program
by
leaving
with
the
understanding
they
would
get
more
money
under
social
security?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
you're
not
conceding
that
that--
justice
stevens
--why
wouldn't
that
be
a
typical
person?
seems
to
me
i've
given
you
a
typical
example
of
a
class
member,
haven't
i?
justice
stevens
it's
certainly
not
unreasonable.
i
know
a
lot
of
people
in
the
navy,
for
example,
who
calculate
their
retirement
benefits
by
different
choices.
and
if
he
knows
he's
earned
his
railroad
benefit
and
he
can
increase
his
social
security
benefit,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
perfectly
rational,
normal
motivation,
one
we
should
assume
he
made?
you
say
it's
legally
irrelevant.
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
going
on,
why
should
we--
justice
stevens
--you
are
saying,
well,
maybe
he
did
that
it's
too
bad.
congress
can
be
rough
on
these
people
if
it
wants
to.
justice
stevens
yes.
