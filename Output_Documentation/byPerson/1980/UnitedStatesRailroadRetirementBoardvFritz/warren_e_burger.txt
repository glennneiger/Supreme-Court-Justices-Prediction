we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
79-870,
united
states
railroad
retirement
board
against
gerhard
fritz.
mr.
kneedler,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
what's
the...
mr.
kneedler,
under
the
social
security
act
standing
alone,
is
there
a
vested
interest
in
the
particular
pattern
of
payments?
chief
justice
burger
they
can
be
given
and
they
can
be
taken
away.
chief
justice
burger
but
isn't
this
also
true
of
people
who
might
spend
20
years
with
general
electric
under
social
security
and
then
go
into
government
service
and
have...
be
part
of
civil
service
retirement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
byron.
chief
justice
burger
mr.
byron,
do
you
suggest
that
a
statute
enacted
by
the
congress
is
constitutionally
vulnerable
because
some
erroneous
information
was
submitted
to
the
congress?
chief
justice
burger
well,
then
that
turns
back
to
what
were
existing
benefits
or
vested
benefits
at
that
time,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
congress
made
some
mistakes.
chief
justice
burger
can
you
distinguish
in
fundamental
terms
between
the
railroad
retirement
act
and
the
social
security
act
as
to
purpose
and
objective?
chief
justice
burger
what
are
the
distinctions?
chief
justice
burger
they're
contributory,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
burger
how
would
the
amount
affect
the
vested
or
non-vested
aspect?
chief
justice
burger
all
of
these
things
certainly
are
persuasive
that
congress
acted
unwisely,
possibly
even
unfairly.
but
how
do
we
find
out
about
the
statute
except
by
reading
the
statute,
if
the
language
is
clear?
chief
justice
burger
if
the
language
is
clear?
chief
justice

burger
your
time
has
expired.

you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
railroad
retirement
board
against
fritz
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
