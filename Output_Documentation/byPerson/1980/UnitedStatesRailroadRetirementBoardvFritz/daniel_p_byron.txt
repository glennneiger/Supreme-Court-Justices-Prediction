mr.
daniel
p.
byron
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
correct
issue
of
this
appeal
is
this:
did
the
district
court
commit
error
when
it
found
that
the
congress's
elimination
of
plaintiffs'
then-vested
retirement
benefits
denied
them
equal
protection
under
the
law?
based
upon
the
undisputed
record
made
below,
the
district
court,
we
submit,
rightly
concluded
that
the
1974
act's
classification
which
is
here
involved
was
utterly
irrational.
it
is
my
intent
here
to
emphasize
several
of
the
primary
reasons
why
the
classification
is
indeed
irrational.
number
one:
i
want
to
take
up
the
point
that
we
make
in
the
briefs
about
this
being
contrary,
the
classification
being
contrary
to
the
actual
purposes
of
the
act.
number
two:
i
want
to
take
up
briefly
the
fact
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
railroad
study
commission's
recommendations
made
to
congress
pertinent
to
resolving
solvency
problems
relevant
to
the
act.
and
number
three:
the
fact
that
regardless
of
the
above,
the
distinction
made
in
the
act
between
the
pertinent
vested
classes
here
to
be
discussed
is
in
and
of
itself
irrational.
first,
the
classification
is
contrary
to
the
actual
and
declared
purposes
of
the
1974
act.
congress
expressly
declared
in
the
purposes
section
of
the
report,
twice,
its
intent
to
preserve
all
retirement
benefits
which
were
then
vested
under
prior
law.
indeed,
the
railroad
board
itself,
the
defendant
in
this
cause
of
action,
assured
congress
of
this
during
the
hearings
on
this
bill.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
i
say
that
because
the
railroad
board
itself
assured
congress
that
our
class
was
included.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
no,
but
i
think
it
is
easy
to
understand
as
we
go
through
the
legislative
history
here
why
congress
thought
they
were
including
everyone,
but
nevertheless
did
not;
that
the
plaintiff's
class
was
actually
exempted.
you're
absolutely
correct
that
section
3(h)
does
exclude
the
plaintiffs
by
its
operation.
however,
i
would
think
it
defies
logical
analysis
to
read
section
3(h)(1)
and
(2)
and
understand
who
might
be,
who
might
lose
their
vested
benefit.
in
fact,
the
act
does
not
speak
of
vesting
at
all,
and
when
you
look
at
the
committee
reports,
they
never
mention
divestment.
the
reports
mention
the
concept
that
everybody
who
had
then,
were
then
vested
under
both
systems,
social
security
and
railroad
retirement,
was
actually
covered
under
the
act.
and
they
make
it
a
primary
purpose
of
the
act.
and
then
they
go
on
to
say...
because
i
pick
up
the
point
that
the
defense
has
made...
that
this
is
a
windfall.
and
they
seem
to
be
critical
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
so-called
windfall...
which,
by
the
way
it
is
not.
but
they
seem
to
be
critical
of
that.
congress
put
in
the
primary
purposes
section
of
this
statute,
congress
said,
"dual
beneficiaries
cannot
be
criticized
because
they
relied
upon
the
law
as
it
then
existed.
"
and
that's
exactly
what
our
people
do.
they
fit
squarely
within
the
pegs
of
any
equities
that
were
discussed
by
congress.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
mr.
justice,
i've...
i'm
suggesting
that
in
part
based
on
the
delaware
tribal
systems
v.
weeks,
the
note
by
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
in
there,
that
while
the
motives
of
congress,
for
example,
is
not...
does
not...
germane
to
the
decision
here.
however,
it
has
some
relevancy
as
to
what
are
the
legislative
objectives
of
the
statute.
so
i'm
saying
it
has
some
relevancy;
however,
it
is
not
a
dispositive
factor.
i
think
the
concern
here
is
the
fact
that
this
is
written
into
the
primary
purposes
section
of
the
statute
and
they
continue
to
pound
away
at
the
point
that
the
congress
does
not
mean
to
criticize
dual
beneficiaries.
and
if
they
really
meant
that,
then
they
would
not
have
meant
to
divest
our
rail-roaders,
who
were
actually
covered
under
both
laws
and
had
fully
performed
ten
to
20
years
of
railroad
service
and
were
inactives
and
had
then
gone
out.
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
the
railroad
board,
after
reviewing
the
final
bill
as
it
pertains
to
3(h),
in
their
written
statement
to
congress
two
of
the
three
railroad
board
members
said
this,
and
i
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
court
to
just
give
a
very
short
quote:
"it
is
sufficient
to
state
here
that
existing
rights
to
such
benefits
will
not
be
adversely
affected
by
this
bill.
"
this
was
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
on
railroad
retirement
and
this
bill
so
provides,
and
this
bill
does
just
the
opposite.
that
was
the
written
testimony
of
railroad
retirement
board
members
neal
speirs
and
wythe
quarles
at
the
senate
hearings
on
this
bill
at
page
289.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes.
vested
benefits
as
of
the
date
of
changeover
to
the
new
act,
which
was
december
31,
1974.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
i
don't
understand
the
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
fine...
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
no,
mr.
justice,
what--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--no,
and
in
fact,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
unfortunately,
when
you
read
through
3(h)(1)
and
3(h)(2)
you
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion.
however,
it
is
so
complex
that
it
defies
logical
analysis
unless
you
have
an
understanding
of
the
legislative
history.
the
reason
why
you
understand
this
is
because
you
see
the
labor-management
negotiations
that
went
on
prior
to
the
time
that
the
bill
was
provided
to
congress.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes.
there
is
no
question.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
well,
mr.
justice,
there
is
this
question
about
the
rational
connection
to
the
legitimate
objectives
of
the
statute,
but
the
objectives
if
the
statute
were
to
cover
our
class.
then,
if
the
act
does
the
contrary,
it
is
irrational
because
the
connection
must
be
connected--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--as
i
understand
equal
protection
analysis,
we're
looking
at
the
legislative
goals
of
congress
and
our
concern
here
is,
what
did
congress
really...
legislative
intent,
and
what
did
congress
really
intend
to
do
here?
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
the
written
primary
purposes
of
the
bill
contained
in
the
house
and
senate
reports
which
say
contrariwise.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
given
the
complexity
of
3(h)(1)
and
3(h)(2)
i
would
submit,
yes,
and
in
further
response,
president
jerry
ford
at
the
time
vetoed
this
legislation
in
large
part
because
of
the
failure
to
understand
the
great
complexity
of
the
act.
in
fact,
i
might
just
parenthetically--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--pardon?
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
president
ford
said
that
it
defied
analysis,
essentially,
in
his
veto
message
to
congress.
and
he
with
the
veto
was
overridden
by
a
great
a
margin.
in
fact,
it
came
up
in
the
carter-ford
debates--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--pardon?
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
right.
because
what
they--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--that's
right,
mr.
justice.
what
you
have
to
understand
is
that
they
thought
they
were
doing
something
other
than
what
they
actually
did
when
they
wrote
3(h)
and
3(h)(1).
what
we're
saying
is
that...
we're
not
saying
the
railroad
board
deceived,
that
they
read
the
bill
and
its
purposes
to--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--but,
but,
mr.
justice,
no
one
raised
the
question,
the
veto
message
did
not
say,
we
have
a
divestment
problem
here.
because
you
could
not
perceive
it.
the
committee
reports
do
not
speak
of
divestment.
in
fact,
the
committee
reports
suggest
that
the
railroad
study
commission
which
reported
to
congress
after
analyzing
the
act
for
two
years...
reported
on
june
30,
1972...
that
everyone
was
to
be
protected,
and
i
think,
when
you
read
through
the
legislative
history
and
the
primary
purposes
section,
you
would
understand
why
congress
thought
they
were
doing
what
the
railroad
study
commission
told
them
to
do,
because--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--yes,
because...
that's
right,
mr.
justice,
because
we
are
submitting
without
question
that
there
is
no
rational
distinction
between
the
similarly
situated
vested
classes,
those
with
ten
to
25
years
of
service.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
mr.
justice,
i'll
take
a
win
on
any
particular
point,
that
or
any
other.
but
i
think
it
is
correct,
that
is,
one
of
our
points
of
analysis
here
to
be
discussed.
i
want
to
mention,
though,
the
congress's
other
goal.
the
question
was
put
to
mr.
kneedler
about
the
conserving
of
fiscal
resources
as
being
a
basis,
a
sine
qua
non
for
actually
having
this
statute
pass
muster
with
the
supreme
court.
that
is
not
enough,
obviously,
because
if
it
were
you
would
be
saying
that
every
congressional
cutback
would
avoid
and
be
immunized
from
scrutiny
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
that's
not
what
we're
saying,
and
i
don't
think
mr.
kneedler
is
saying
that
either.
i
think
he
is
saying
we
still,
you
must
still
find
rationality
on
this,
and
there
is
still
equal
protection
analysis.
we
are
not
here
arguing
a
toothless
standard.
but
on
this
question
of
conservation
of
fiscal
resources,
it's
very
interesting
because
the
railroad
study
commission
reported
to
congress,
concerned
itself
with
the
elimination
of
a
9
percent
actuarial
deficiency,
and
that
is
well
and
fine.
however,
that
was
not
resolved
or
furthered
by
the
elimination
of
the
plaintiff's
benefits.
instead,
these
benefits
were
confiscated
so
as
to
help
fund
other
unrelated
benefits
that
were
liberalized.
the
liberalization
caused
the
deficiency
to
escalate
to
12
percent,
contrary
to
the
very
purpose
that
they
were
negotiating
on
this
act.
the
3
percent
increased
deficiency
which
was
created
by
the
joint
labor-management
negotiating
committee
was
funded
in
part,
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs,
by
a
trade-off
of
the
plaintiffs'
benefits.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
contrariwise
to
what
they
were
supposed
to
be
doing
to
resolve
the
actuarial
deficiency.
and
the
act's
classification
was
also
contrary
to
the
study
commission's
recommendations
to
congress
in
two
ways.
number
one,
the
commission
strongly
and
repeatedly
urged
the
retention
of
all
vested
rights
to
retirement
benefits
as
of
the
new
proposed
changeover
date,
which
would
be
december
31,
'74.
the
commission
also
repeatedly
stated
that
any
liberalization
of
benefits
must...
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
the
commission
used
the
word
"must"...
they
said,
must
be
accomplished
without
impairing
any
presently
vested
rights.
further,
they
emphasized
that
liberalizations
under
this
act
can
only
be
funded
by
an
increase
in
taxes
on
employer-employee
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
liberalizations.
and
that
makes
every
sense
in
the
world,
because
congress
was
trying
to
resolve
an
actuarial
deficiency,
not
create
a
greater
one.
but
the
jlmc,
but
what
happened
here
is,
you
sent
the
fox
out
to
guard
the
chicken
coop.
and
the
fox
goes
out
and
creates
another
3
percent
deficiency
and
the
only
way
you
can
get
that
job
done
is
to,
in
the
words
of
the
jlmc,
"hit"
or
eliminate
the
plaintiff
class
because
they're
inactives
and
they
don't
have
to
answer
to
the
unions
anymore.
now,
the
distinction
here--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--no,
i
am
not.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes,
i
do,
because,
you
see,
the
jlmc
in
the
colloquies
they
engaged
in
in
congress
assured
congress
everyone
was
being
vested.
and
secondly,
the
commission
recommended
that.
they
saw
the
distinction
here
but--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--mr.
justice,
it
is
not...
the...
because
we're
looking
at
what
the
legislative
objectives
in
this
particular
reported
bill
and
statute
are.
in
other
words,
if
there's
actual
legislative
goals
and
objectives
of
this
act;
and
this
distinction
does
not
further
but
is
contrary
to
those
goals,
then
i
submit
that
under
equal
protection
analysis
we
must
have
a
win
on
that
point.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes,
and
that
was
the
goal
of
congress.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes;
now,
that's
just...
that's
one
argument.
however,
i
think
the
point
is
here
that
if
congress
had
not
considered
this
point,
then
i'd
say
that
our
point
would
not
be
well
taken.
but
congress
here
really
meant
to
make
the
dividing
line
between
the
vesteds
and
the
non-vesteds.
and
they
did
that
because
the
railroad
board
told
them
that
was
what
was
being
done
and
the
jlmc
told
them
that's
what
was
being
done,
and
they
also
believed
they
were
following
the
commission
recommendations
when
in
fact
they
were
not
because
of
the
sections
3(h)
and
3(h)(1).
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes.
ah--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--in
my
opinion,
the
jlmc.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
that
is
not
my
gut
reaction.
it
is
in
our
brief
at
various
points
where
we
point
out
that
colloquies...
and
let
me
explain.
this,
you
know,
it's
a
good--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--yes,
and
i
think
that
helps
explain--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--and
jlmc.
and
i
don't
think
the
railroad
board
intentionally
deceived
congress.
however,
they
assisted
this
deception
by
stating
that
our
people
were
covered
when
they
in
fact
were
not
and
everybody
went
about
passing
a
statute
without
the
understanding
that--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--well,
they
asked
the
jlmc
to
negotiate
the
statute.
and--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
it's
not.
it's
in
the
report
of
the
house
and
the
report
of
the
senate,
and
it's
a--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--no.
it's
stated
in
the
report,
and
it
says,
here
in
the
front,
first
page,
"principal
purpose
of
the
bills",
in
the
second
paragraph.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes,
but
not
just
made
a
mistake.
i'm
saying,
further,
that
congress
thought
they
were
including
our
class
when
they
actually
weren't
because
they
saw,
everybody
saw
the
dividing
line
here
between
vesteds
and
non-vesteds,
and
the
problem
here
is
that
the
actuarial
deficiency
was
not
resolved
by
our
class.
the
problem
was
that
they
went
out
and
made
the
deficiency
from
9
percent
to
12
percent
and
then
used
our
class
as
part
of
the
trade-off
to
fund
the
other
3
percent.
but
i
think...
i
want
to
get
this
point
about
the
real
distinction
here,
the
rational
distinction
between
the
classes,
because
we're
only
talking
here
about
a
distinction
based
on
timing.
it's
a
new
timing
requirement,
you
see,
that
divided
the
vesteds,
the
similarly
situated
vesteds,
between...
all
of
us,
all
of
the
vesteds,
had
10
to
25
years
of
railroad
service
and
ten
years
of
social
security,
thereby
earning
a
full
dual
benefit.
however,
and
for
the
first
time
ever,
congress
in
3(h)(1)
and
3(h)(2)
brought
about
this
new
current
connection
requirement
and
gave
four
different
ways
in
which
our
people
who
were
vested
back
on
december
31,
1974,
could
continue
to
be
vested
under
the
new
act.
actually,
what
that
is
is
a
divesting
rule,
and
the
government
concedes
that
only
timing
of
their
prior
railroad
service
is
the
question
here
involved.
and
this
new
timing
requirement,
you
understand,
amounted
to
a
changing
of
the
vesting
rules
ex
post
facto,
i.e.,
after
the
game
was
played
and
the
benefit
had
been
earned
and
acquired.
its
sole
purpose
as
the
legislative
history
we've
put
in
our
brief
shows,
the
sole
purpose
was
to
"hit"
and
to
"eliminate"
the
inactive
railroaders
who
had
no...
that
the
unions,
they
felt,
had
no
allegiance
to
anymore.
somebody
had
to
go,
in
their
opinion,
and
that
was
not
true,
because
as
we've
said,
it
was
only
true
because
they
raised
the
deficiency
to
12
percent.
timing
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
extent
or
the
length
of
the
railroaders'
credited
service.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
earning
or
the
gaining
of
the
retirement
benefit.
it
is
non-sensical,
in
fact.
the
timing
distinction
is
not
based
on
character
of
service,
length
of
service,
or
the
amount
of
the
contributions
of
the
employer
or
the
employee.
a
railroad
retirement
benefit,
as
the
commission
noted,
is
earned
on
the
basis
of
past
service
and
past
contributions,
not
present
service
or
some
so-called
tenuous
connection
like
present
affinity--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--well,
i
can't...
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
hypothetical
i've
never
seen
that--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--no,
that
is
incorrect,
in
our
opinion.
that
what
we
were
saying
here
is
that...
we're
talking
about
past
earned
retirement
benefits,
we're
not
talking
about
getting
a
new
benefit
or
an
additional
benefit.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
well,
that
might
be
the
case
if
there
were
no
vesting
or
no
actually
having
earned
it,
but
if
you're
talking
about
non-vesteds,
they're
in
a
different
category
and
that's
a
different
situation.
but
what
our
concern
is
that
these
people
have
earned
their
vested
retirement
benefit.
it
was
vested
under
prior
law
at
that
time.
in
fact,
the
government,
the
railroad
board,
had
a
benefit
pamphlet,
the
last
one
before
the
act
was
february,
1974.
in
that
benefits
pamphlet,
they
said,
if
you
have
ten
years
of
railroad
service,
you
have
a
"permanent"
right
to
this
benefit.
now,
i
submit
that
having
this
destroyed
and
emasculated
in
the
way
it
has
been
is
not
the
same,
or
the
equivalent
of
a
permanent
right
to
a
benefit.
they
relied
on
the
government.
and
what
did
they
get
for
their
reliance?
they
lost
this
so-called
windfall.
and
it
is
not
a
windfall.
a
windfall
is
an
unexpected
sum
of
money.
this
was
expected.
this
was
relied
upon
by
these
people.
it
is
a
windfall
only
because
the
railroad
study
commission
said
it's
an
excess
dual
benefit
if
you
assume,
arguendo,
that
both
benefits
were
earned
under
social
security.
but,
of
course,
since
they
were
not
earned
under
social
security,
the
hypothetical
doesn't
stand
up
and
so
the
windfall
is
not
there.
it's
not
a
real
windfall,
it's
not
a
gratuity
that
these
people
were
being
given.
it
was
an
earned
retirement
benefit.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
as
the
dissent--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--they're
both
contributory.
however,
social
security
contributions
were
half
that
of
the
railroad
retirement.
secondly,
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
in
hisquierdo,
the--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--in
this
way:
as
the
railroad
board
pamphlet
showed,
if
you
have
past
service,
plus
in
addition
to
that
made
the
necessary
contributions
over
those
particular
years
of
past
service;
then
you
earned
your
permanent
right
to
the
benefit.
so,
it
was
a
key
or
an
element
to
earning
the
benefit.
now,
i
wanted
to
take
up
the
argument
of
the
government
about
what
is
this
great
rational
distinction
between
these
ten
to
25-year
vesteds?
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
because
the
act
had
been--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--your
honor,
i'd
have
a
different
class.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
and
i'd
have
a
much
more
difficult
problem.
and
i...
no
question
about
that.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
it...
it
assisted--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--yes.
that
helps
carry
the
day.
i
mean,
all
of
this
taken
together--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--well,
no,
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
no,
i
disagree
in
the
sense
that
if
i
had
that
class
to
come
here
and
present--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--i'd
certainly
be
arguing
that.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
i'd
have
a
tougher
case
than
i've
got
right
here.
the
reason
is
because
they
say
this
current
connection
rule
and
the
work-in-1974
rule
is
intended
to
favor
career
railroaders
who
have
greater
equities,
or
as
they
put
in
their
reply
brief,
a
greater
stake
to
dual
benefits.
but
the
protected
class
has
no
more
career
time
than
the
plaintiffs'
divested
class
and
they
have
no
greater
"stake"
than
our
railroaders.
they
have,
number
one,
no
greater
contributions;
they
have
no
greater
length
of
service;
and
they
have
no
greater
vesting
basis.
in
fact,
they
have
the
same
exact
amount
of
time,
ten
to
25
years.
but
this
rule,
i
submit,
is
antithetical
to
a
career.
it
speaks
of
a
current
connection,
not
a
career
connection.
no
one
is
calling
this
the
career
connection
rule.
nor
was
it
ever
suggested
in
congress
or
anywhere
else
that
it
might
be.
it
says,
for
example,
all
you
need
to
do
is
have
a
1974
connection
and
you
can,
then
disregard
any
career
notion
that
you
might
have.
of
equal
importance,
of
course,
is
that
neither
congress
nor
the
jlmc
ever
suggested
such
a
connection
between
the
rule
and
a
career
during
all
the
negotiations
under
the
act.
now,
of
course,
trying
to
make
career
railroaders
out
of
10-year
men...
and
the
question
was
put
to
mr.
kneedler;
i
think
it's
a
good
question...
is
contrary
and
antithetical
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
ever
since
1937.
this
is
so
because
a
major
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
encourage
elder
workers.
they
don't
say
career
workers,
they
say
older
workers...
to
retire
so
as
to
encourage
younger
workers
to
take
their
place,
and
to
do
this
in
a
declining
employment
industry.
it
moved
from
1,280,000
back
in
the
old
days
to...
in
the
1970s...
to
500-and-some
thousand.
it's
now
in
the
400,000-level.
plaintiffs'
departure--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--we
find
that
out
by
looking
at
the
house
and
the
senate
reports,
and--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--the
language
is
not
clear.
you
know,
i
understand
that
if
you
take
the
legislative
history...
if
you
take
the
legislative
history,
and
you
look
at
what
the
railroad
study
commission
said,
and
you
understand
that
congress's
determination
for
dividing
the
classes
was
a
vested
basis,
then
it's
clear
that
our
class
was
to
be
included.
but
even...
but
as
i'm
saying,
assuming
arguendo
regardless
of
that
fact,
the
point
is,
there
is
no
rational
distinction
here
because
we
are
not
arguing
here
over
a
welfare
benefit,
for
example,
or
a
gratuity,
or
an
unexpected
sum
of
money.
this
is
not
a
new
benefit
that's
being
awarded.
and
i
want
to
mention,
just
very
briefly,
the
fact
that
historically
the
current
connection
use
is
negated
here,
because
it
was
never
used
in
connection
with
the
basic
retirement
benefit,
and
it
was
never
used
as
a
divesting
mechanism,
which
is
what
it's
used
here
for.
it
has
only
been
used
in
connection
with
a
brand
new
supplemental
benefit
or
some
other
new
benefit
to
be
awarded.
and
we
wouldn't
complain
if
that
were
the
case.
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
this
is
not,
we're
not
talking
about
trying
to
get
some
additional
benefit
that
we're
being
denied.
we're
asking
for
a
benefit
that
our
class
already
had.
it
was
always
a
reward
for
an
additional
benefit,
so
they...
historically,
it
has
never
been
used
in
the
context
here.
and
indeed,
of
course,
the
railroad
study
commission
never
considered
it
and
congress
never
really
addressed
it
in
the
hearings.
now,
we
mention
several
other
points
that
we
feel
heighten
the
irrationality
of
the
statute
here
involved,
including
the
reliance
on
benefits
and
the
vested
nature
of
them.
we
also
point
out
that
the
age
and
inability
of
our
railroaders
to
rework
their
careers...
because,
you
see,
they're
all
of
advanced
age...
they
cannot
relive
their
lives;
they
cannot
recoup
their
loss
by
some
other
means
of
employment.
for
our
railroaders,
the
loss
comes
about
at
a
point
when
it's
too
late
for
them
to
say,
well,
i
guessed
wrong,
and
i've
got
to
go
back.
they
can't
do
it.
but,
of
course,
there
is
no
encouragement
under
this
act
to
get
them
back.
in
summary,
let
me
say
that
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
would
be
to
say
that
the
plaintiffs,
whose
working
lives
are
essentially
over,
guessed
wrong
as
to
that
most
finite
and
once-only
resource,
their
own
working
years
and
lives;
that
what
they
were
told
by
congress
were
the
requirements
for
vesting,
and
what
they
were
told
would
be
their
reward
for
staying
with
the
industry
for
ten
years--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--yes.
i
believe
you
touched
on
it
before
when
you
said
that
if
you
flip-flop,
if
you
have
social
security
first
and
railroad
retirement
second,
you
qualify
and
get
the
dual
benefit.
however,
if
you
did
it
conversely
and
had
railroad
retirement
first
and
was
encouraged,
actually...
because
the
act
was
trying
to
encourage
these
workers
to
leave,
so
our
people
followed
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
they
left,
and
now
they've
lost
their
benefit
because
of
it.
now,
they
would
not
vest.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
yes--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--no,
no.
we're
talking
about
the
same
dual...
in
other
words,
we're
using
two
people,
the
same,
both
entitled
to
a
full
dual
benefit.
that
means
he
gets,
you
know,
a
benefit
because
of
ten
to
25
years
in
the
railroad
service
and
another
benefit
because
he
had
40
quarters
of
social
security.
now,
the
one
who
did
his
conversely,
or
who
was
lucky
enough
to
work
one
day
in
1974
on
the
railroad--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--right.
that's
it.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
no,
no.
he
did
not.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
no,
and
they
followed...
the
benefits
pamphlet
said
they
had
a
permanent
right
to
it.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
but
they...
so,
they
did
not,
and
what
they're
saying
is,
there's
an
excess
of--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--well,
hisquierdo
did
not
bring
it
up.
and
in
fact--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--it
said...
yes,
the
majority
said
it
was--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--noncontractual,
the
dicta
did.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
well,
i'm
not
saying...
i'm
not
here
arguing
under
the
due
process
component.
i'm
arguing
under
the
equal
protection
component.
i--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--well,
i'm
saying
it's
something
that
can,
certainly.
it's
certainly
something
more
than
a
gratuity
or
a
welfare
benefit,
and
i
think...
you
know,
i
take
note,
mr.
justice,
that
in
some
of
your
analyses
under
the
equal
protection
analysis,
that
the
kind
of
property
that
is
involved
here--
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
--has
some
bearing.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
daniel
p.
byron
very
well.
