justice
white
this
argument,
i
take
it,
goes
to
the
suggestion
that
dr.
grigson
isn't
a
"hanging
psychiatrist"
necessarily.
is
that
it?
justice
white
now,
are
these
statistics...
of
record?
how
do
we
know
what
you
are
saying?
it
is
part
of
this
record?
justice
white
right;
right.
but
you
might
have
had
testimony
with
respect
to
this
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
that's
what
i
was
leading
up
to,
to
asking
you
whether
some
of
these
claims
were
ever
presented
to
the
state
courts?
justice
white
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
claims?
justice
white
where...
in
what...
where?
justice
white
well,
would
these
claims
have
been
open
in
the
state
courts
on
a
state
collateral
proceeding?
i
know
the
state
collateral
relief
was
denied
just
summarily,
without
an
opinion.
do
you
know
whether
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
claims
were
properly
presented,
could
have
been
properly
presented
in
a
state
collateral
proceeding?
justice
white
i'm
asking
about
this
case.
justice
white
i
know,
but
i'm
asking
whether
these
claims
were
properly
presented
in
the
state
collateral
proceeding.
were
those
claims
open
in
the
state
collateral
proceeding
if
they
hadn't
been
raised
on
direct
appeal?
justice
white
so
they
denied
them
on
the
state
collateral?
justice
white
so
state
remedies
have
been
exhausted?
justice
white
well,
then
your
claim,
is
it,
must
be,
then,
that
state
remedies
haven't
been
exhausted?
justice
white
i
don't
understand
your
position
on
exhaustion
then.
do
you
claim
that
they
should
go
back
to
the
state
courts
first
or
not?
justice
white
--the
court
of
appeals
didn't
proceed
on
the
basis
of
anything
that
was
deliberate
by
the
state.
it
just
said
it
was
surprise.
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
they
affirmed
the
judgment
but
did
they
say
it
was
deliberate?
justice
white
well,
what
if
dr.
grigson
were
asked
to
examine
100,
or
say
50
defendants,
and
he
examined
them
and
50
of
them,
or
25
of
them,
he
said,
nothing
wrong
with
these
people,
and
the
others,
he
said
they
were
sociopaths.
and
the
prosecution
asked
for
the
death
penalty
for
25,
and
not
for
25
others.
and
then
they
called
grigson
and
the
25,
they...
would
you
call
him
prosecution-oriented?
justice
white
well,
how
do
you
know
it
isn't?
how
do
you
know
it
isn't?
justice
white
well,
that's
a
different
answer.
you
asserted
a
fact,
and
i
asked
you
how
you
knew
it.
justice
white
well,
have
you
followed
the
cases
where
the
prosecution
hasn't
asked
for
the
death
penalty
and
grigson
has
examined
the
defendant,
or
hasn't
that
ever
happened?
justice
white
well,
who
knows?
justice
white
but
you're
still
asserting
the
fact
that
he's
a
prosecution-oriented
psychiatrist,
and
i'm
not
sure
you
know
that
except
based
on
all
the
cases
in
which
he
testified,
in
which
he
said
defendant
was
a
sociopath.
justice
white
and
that
is
the
basis
for
your--
justice
white
--the
sole
basis
for
your
statement?
justice
white
how
much
time
did
counsel
ask
for
when
grigson
was
called?
or
did
he
ask
for
any?
justice
white
was
his
motion
to
exclude
the
testimony
based
on
anything
other
than
surprise?
justice
white
and
was
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
claim
ever
presented
in
the
direct
appeal,
on
the
direct
appeal?
justice
white
and
is
the
rule
in
texas
that
those
claims
were
open,
or
that
they're
not?
justice
white
well,
he
could
be
called
to
testify
by
the
state
at
the
penalty
trial.
justice
white
well,
what's
their
answer
to
the
sixth
amendment
claim?
even
if
that
were
so,
it
wouldn't
dispose
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
white
--if
he
refuses,
when
it's
the
end
of
it,
you'd
just
say,
they'd
just
try
him.
justice
white
you
would
just
try
him.
justice
white
yes,
but
what
if
the
defendant
refuses
to
say
a
word,
to
even
talk
to
them?
the
state
is
free
to
try
him
then,
i
take
it.
justice
white
but
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
there
couldn't
be
a
waiver
of
counsel
at
this
stage
without
the
help
of
counsel?
justice
white
you're
not
claiming
that
and
you're
not
going
that
far?
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
but
at
least
you
say
there
was
no
waiver
here?
justice
white
was
there
ever
an
opportunity
to
waive
counsel?
justice
white
well,
did
the
judge
give
him
an
hour?
justice
white
why?
