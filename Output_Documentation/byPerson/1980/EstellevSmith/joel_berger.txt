mr.
joel
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
we
have
before
the
court
today
basically
two
sets
of
issues,
either
one
of
which
standing
alone
is
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
death
sentence
imposed
upon
mr.
smith.
mr.
joel
berger
i
believe
there
technically
is
because
the
5th
circuit
decision
has
been
stayed
and
mr.
smith
is
presently
on
death
row
in
texas.
now
these
two
issues
can
be
loosely
described
as--
mr.
joel
berger
--the
5th
circuit.
mr.
joel
berger
i
might
add,
we
did
not
oppose
that.
the
choice
for
mr.
smith
was
either
the
dallas
county
jail
or
ellis
unit
at
huntsville,
and
given
the
amounts
of
time
that
would
pass
we
felt
that
he
would
still
be
better
off
down
there
at
huntsville.
one
issue
is
the
surprise
witness
issue,
which
is
grounded
in
both
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
dealing
with
the
manner
in
which
the
state
presented
dr.
grigson's
testimony
at
the
penalty
phase.
the
other
issue
with
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
components
deals
with
the
manner
in
which
the
state
obtained
the
very
basis
for
this
testimony
in
the
first
place.
mr.
joel
berger
no,
mr.
justice
white,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
finding
below.
mr.
joel
berger
yes,
they
expressly
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
of
facts
that
the
prosecutors
had
intentionally
failed
to
place
dr.
grigson's
name
on
the
witness
list
in
a
deliberate
effort
to
surprise
defense
counsel.
mr.
joel
berger
i
think
it
would
make
the
state's
case
a
little
easier--
mr.
joel
berger
--yes.
although
the
court
of
appeals
did
point
out
that
even
if
it
was
inadvertent,
the
prejudice
in
this
case
was
so
substantial
that
the
result
might
very
well
be
the
same.
mr.
joel
berger
i
do
think
that
it
makes
the
case
stronger
because
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
record,
no
doubt
at
all,
that
the
prosecutors
knew
several
days
in
advance
that
they
were
going
to
call
dr.
grigson
and
in
fact
deliberately
tricked
defense
counsel
here.
if
you'll
look
at
pages
15
and
16
of
the
appendix,
the
voir
dire
examination
of
dr.
grigson
prior
to
his
actual
testimony,
this
examination
took
place
on
tuesday,
march
26,
1974,
just
before
he
actually
testified.
and
he
says
there,
page
15,
that
he
had
been
asked
to
testify
in
this
case
the
previous
thursday,
thursday,
march
21,
1974,
five
days
earlier.
he
specifically
had
been
told
that
he
would
be
called,
that
he
would
be
needed
the
following
week.
over
on
the
next
page
he
is
again
asked
whether
he
was
requested
to
testify
in
advance,
he
again
answered
in
the
affirmative.
i
think
in
context
there
he
is
quite
probably
talking
about
even
an
earlier
date.
i
must
correct
one
thing
ms.
ashton
said,
if
i
heard
her
correctly.
she
said
that
the
prosecution
had
not
contacted
dr.
grigson
prior
to
march
21.
that
is
not
true
and
pages
14
and
15
illustrate
that.
dr.
grigson,
in
fact,
discussed
his
findings
at
a
much
earlier
date
with
the
prosecutor,
gave
the
prosecutor
a
copy
of
his
report,
and
was,
i
think
it
is
fair
from
page
16,
asked
sometime
prior
to
march
21
to
testify.
as
ms.
ashton
pointed
out,
dr.
grigson
does
most
of
his
work
in
the
courts
in
dallas.
he
regularly
transacts
business
with
the
dallas
district
attorney's
office.
they
knew
about
his
involvement
in
this
case
way
before
the
21st
and
it
is
clear
that
at
the
very
minimum,
no
later
than
march
21,
they
knew
he
would
testify.
mr.
joel
berger
excuse
me?
mr.
joel
berger
no,
i
was
not.
mr.
joel
berger
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
was
one
of
the
earliest
cases
under
the
new
texas
statute,
one
of
the
very
first.
it
may
have
even
been
the
first
or
second.
mr.
joel
berger
i
don't
know
that
for
sure.
as
the
court
knows,
it
was
the
only
case
that
had
been
affirmed
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
other
than
jurek
at
the
time
that
jurek
was
decided.
mr.
joel
berger
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
berger
well,
yes,
that
is
this
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joel
berger
correct.
that
is
dr.
grigson
who
is
being
referred
to
there.
neither
mr.
simmons,
the
defense
attorney,
or
i
think
this
court
at
the
time
of
jurek
really
knew
very
much
about
dr.
grigson.
in
dallas
dr.
grigson
had
begun
to
make
something
of
a
reputation
for
himself
as
a
prosecution-oriented
psychiatrist.
there
are
some
cases
cited
in
the
opinions
below
that
were
decided
prior
to
the
trial
in
this
case,
non-death
cases,
or
one
that's
a
death
case
under
the
old
statute,
but
cases--
mr.
joel
berger
--that
is
certainly
correct.
it's
relevant
here,
though,
particularly
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
claim,
because
it
points
out
a
problem
that
we
have
in
texas
with
psychiatrists
who
regularly
work
with
the
prosecution,
going
in
to
see
defendant
at
the
jail
after
he
has
been
indicted
and
after
counsel
has
been
appointed.
we're
concerned
with
that
practice
as
done
by
psychiatrists
who
are
antecedently
favorable
to
the
state.
that's
where
it
comes
in.
of
course--
mr.
joel
berger
--in
view
of
the
use
to
which...
i
would
say
that
his
approach
might
be
more
balanced
if
that
were
the
case,
which
it
is
not.
but
i
would
still
be--
mr.
joel
berger
--i
would
still...
we
can
look
at
the
cases
in
which
he
has
testified
that
are
reported,
cases
that
have
been
through
the
courts.
mr.
joel
berger
well,
i
think
that
the
state
has
had
ample
opportunity
in
this
case
to
give
us
some
information
on
him.
mr.
joel
berger
well,
i
can
state,
having
followed
texas
death
cases
for
the
last
three
years,
four
years,
that
i
have
never--
mr.
joel
berger
--i
do
not
know
whether
it
has
happened
or
not.
i
do
know
i
have
never--
mr.
joel
berger
--i
have
never
been
told
of
it
happening.
i
realize
all
this
is
outside
the
record.
ms.
ashton
was
asked
about
it
first,
and
so
i'm
responding
in
like
fashion.
it's
not
only--
mr.
joel
berger
--i
do
not
know
of
a
single
death
case
in
which
he
testified
for
the
defense.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
joel
berger
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
berger
also
the
fact
that
balanced
against
my
lack
of
knowledge
of
one
case
in
which
he
has
appeared
for
the
defense,
is
a
long
list
of
cases
in
which
he
has
appeared
for
the
prosecution,
a
very
long
list.
mr.
joel
berger
yes,
they
would,
mr.
justice
stevens,
of
course.
even
if
he
testified
for
the
prosecution
in
25
cases
and
for
the
defense
in
the
other
25,
we
would
still
maintain
that
the
way
he
approaches
these
capital
defendants--
mr.
joel
berger
--yes,
and
i'll
go
a
step
farther:
if
the
case
did
not
involve
dr.
grigson
but
involved
some
other
psychiatrist.
mr.
joel
berger
defense
counsel
often
does
do
that,
of
course.
of
course.
mr.
joel
berger
well,
i
think
it
is
relevant
only
in
one
sense.
at
least
there's
one
particular
sense
in
which
i
think
it
is
most
relevant
and
then
i
will
turn
away
from
it,
which
is
only
that
in,
i
think
we
have
to
take
cognizance
of
the
practice
that
goes
on
down
in
texas
that
the
5th
circuit
was
aware
of
at
the
time
it
decided
this
case.
the
5th
circuit
recognized
certain
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
safeguards,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
they
were
not
acting
on
a
blank
slate,
they
were
not
dealing
with
one
case
in
which
this
particular
procedure
happened
to
occur
once.
they
were
dealing
with
a
specific
problem
involving
many
psychiatrists,
primarily
this
psychiatrist.
and
i
think
when
federal
courts
impose
the
types
of
safeguards
that
were
imposed
here,
it's
of
some
relevance
that
they
are
responding
to
a
particular
need
rather
than
to
isolated
needs.
mr.
joel
berger
absolutely
none;
he
gave
no--
mr.
joel
berger
--that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
berger
i
don't
think
that
standing
alone
would
create
due
process
violation.
mr.
joel
berger
no,
that
standing
alone
would
not
create
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
joel
berger
the
main
ground
of
our
surprise
claim
is
the
way
the
state
ultimately
presented
this
doctor,
by
leaving
his
name
off
the
witness
list
and
then
calling
him
as
a
last
minute
surprise
witness.
they
knew--
mr.
joel
berger
--that
is
not
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
on
page
23
of
their
brief
in
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
state
says
the
following:
"since
the
state
witness,
dr.
grigson,
was
temporarily
unavailable
to
testify,
the
defense
agreed
to
proceed
with
its
witnesses
before
the
presentation
of
dr.
grigson's
testimony.
"
the
state
has
never
claimed
that
he
was
a
rebuttal
witness;
never.
mr.
joel
berger
the
texas
court,
looking
at
the
record,
decided
for
themselves
that
he
had
been
a
rebuttal
witness
and
i
think
the
state's
comment
there
in
the
5th
circuit
two
years
later
is
quite
relevant,
because
they
are
admitting
that
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
made
a
mistake.
now--
mr.
joel
berger
--the
trial
attorney
did;
yes.
mr.
joel
berger
yes.
mr.
joel
berger
well,
i'm
not
sure,
because
the
state
did
not
point
to
that
subpoena
in
the
district
court
and
as
a
result
we
had
no
opportunity
to
respond
to
say
anything
about
what
it
might
have
meant.
them...
sort
of
looking
at
that
subpoena
like
some
sort
of
a
smoking
gun,
two
courts
later,
and
for
the
first
time
waving
it
front
of
us
and
saying,
ah,
this
obviously
means
that
he
knew.
now,
defense
counsel
was
about
to
go
on
trial
that
day.
he
issued,
i
think,
10
or
12
subpoenas
that
day
for
all
kinds
of
information.
when
you're
preparing
to
go
to
trial
on
a
case
you
want
to
learn
everything
you
can
conceivably
know
about
the
case,
you
follow
all
kinds
of
blind
leads,
and
several
of
those
subpoenas,
other
subpoenas
that
day,
i
don't
even
understand
what
they
were
about,
they
don't
seem
to
tie
into
anything
in
the
case.
that
subpoena,
as
i
understand
it,
was
for
jail
visitation
records.
for
all
we
know
he
may
have
wanted
to
to
check
that
no
one
else
had
signed
in
with
dr.
grigson,
if
there
was
some
other
person
present
at
the
interview
who
might
show
up
as
a
rebuttal
witness
after
smith
took
the
stand.
i
don't
know.
the
record
is
blank
because
the
state
did
not
point
to
that
subpoena.
mr.
joel
berger
after
the
motion
to
bar
dr.
grigson's
testimony
was
denied,
the
trial
judge
on
his
own
recognizing
that
counsel
was
surprised
offered
counsel
one
hour.
and
under
the
circumstances
mr.
simmons
accepted
one
hour.
mr.
joel
berger
no,
he
did
not.
i
think
that,
in
context,
the
reason
that
that
happened
was
simply
his
belief
that
that
was
just
out
of
the
question,
given
the
realities
of
the
situation.
we
were
late
into
the
trial,
the
jury
had
been
sequestered
already,
they
were
sequestered
after
the
testimony
on
guilt/innocence.
that's
on
page
20
of
the
state
trial
transcript.
and
the
judge
offered
him
an
hour;
he
saw
that
was
all
he
was
going
to
get;
and
so
that's
how
he
proceeded.
mr.
joel
berger
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
not.
mr.
joel
berger
not
on
the
direct
appeal.
it
was
presented
for
the
first
time
in
the
state
habeas
corpus
petition
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
joel
berger
yes,
they...
i
believe
that
that
is
the
rule,
i
believe
that's
what
i
understood
ms.
ashton
to
say,
and
certainly
there
was
no
exhaustion
problem.
mr.
joel
berger
oh,
yes;
definitely,
definitely.
mr.
joel
berger
yes.
there
was
no
opinion
on
the
fifth
amendment
issue.
pardon
me...
on
the
surprise
issue,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
specifically
spoke.
mr.
joel
berger
well,
they
did
not
say
that.
i'm
not
aware--
mr.
joel
berger
--i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
rule
of
law
in
texas,
no.
mr.
joel
berger
also,
i
might
add
that
the
state
did
not
defend
on
that
grounds
either.
mr.
joel
berger
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
opinion?
no.
no,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
treated
it
fairly
as
a
surprise
question
and
they
did
not
say,
you
should
have
moved
for
a
continuance.
they
went
on
to
the
merits.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
salient
fact
about
the
surprise
issue
that
i
don't
think
has
come
out
thus
far.
the
state
says
they
didn't
know
that
dr.
grigson
would
testify,
as
of
march
11
when
they
submitted
the
witness
list.
and
we
say
they
clearly
knew
as
of
march
21.
they
say,
as
i
understand
it,
we
were
under
no
obligation
to
add
names
to
the
list
after
we
filed
it.
on
march
25,
a
monday,
the
opening
day
of
the
trial,
the
day
before
dr.
grigson's
testimony,
defense
counsel
made
a
motion
in
limine
asking
the
trial
court
to
bar
the
testimony
of
any
individual
not
on
that
list.
and
that
motion
was
granted.
now,
you'd
think
since
it
was
clear
from
the
record
that
no
later
than
the
previous
thursday
they
knew
they
were
going
to
call
dr.
grigson.
this
would
have
been
the
appropriate
moment,
if
not
sooner,
for
the
district
attorney
to
stand
up
and
say,
your
honor,
one
moment,
please.
if
you
are
going
to
sign
that
order
in
limine,
we
would
like
to
make
one
exception,
we
would
like
to
add
the
name
of
dr.
james
t.
grigson.
we
realize
he
was
not
on
the
list
up
to
now.
we
apologize
for
that,
but
we
want
to
give
defense
counsel
notice
at
this
time.
please
make
him
an
exception
to
that
order
in
limine.
that
wouldn't
have
been
particularly
difficult
to
do.
yet
the
state
did
not
do
that.
they
said
nothing.
they
remained
silent.
and
that's
why
we're
before
the
court
on
a
firm
findings
of
fact
that
there
was
a
deliberate,
intentional
effort
to
surprise
defense
counsel.
now,
of
course,
the
testimony
of
dr.
grigson
was
highly
impeachable.
we
know
that
from
the
american
psychiatric
association
brief.
we're
not
saying
here
that
it's
inadmissible;
we're
not
saying
here
that
it
cannot
form
a
reliable
basis
for
the
death
sentence.
we
did
plead
those
points
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
please
don't
misunderstand
me;
we
pleaded
them.
they
were
not
reached
by
the
district
court,
they
were
not
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
fact
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court
commented
on
it
at
all,
the
district
court
said
that
in
its
view
it
thought
such
testimony
ought
to
be
admissible.
mr.
joel
berger
yes.
the
american
psychiatric
association
does
not
believe
that
such
predictions
can
be
reliably
made.
that
is
their
position;
it
applies
to
both
sides.
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to,
in
the
remaining
time,
turn
if
i
may
to
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
issues
because
i
don't
think
they
have
been
aired
sufficiently
thus
far.
here
there
was
absolutely
no
dispute
of
fact
at
all.
the
state
has
never
claimed
that
dr.
grigson
gave
mr.
smith
warnings
of
any
sort
and
we
know
that
he
did
not.
on
february
18,
1974,
dr.
grigson
went
to
the
jail.
at
this
time
mr.
smith
had
been
under
indictment
for
nearly
two
months.
the
indictment
was
december
28,
1973.
defense
counsel
had
been
appointed
nearly
four
months
earlier,
october
25,
1973,
and
only
18
days
earlier
the
state
had
announced
that
it
intended
to
seek
the
death
penalty.
dr.
grigson
went
to
the
jail
and
he
simply
proceeded
to
speak
with
mr.
smith
for
about
90
minutes.
he
said
that
mr.
smith
cooperated
fully,
he
was
pleasant,
he
was
courteous,
he
was
extremely
polite.
and
during
those
90
minutes
this
man
facing
trial
for
his
life
unknowingly,
unknowingly
provided
prosecution
with
the
basis
for
the
only
testimony
presented
against
him
at
the
penalty
phase.
no
one
ever
told
mr.
smith
that
his
encounter
with
dr.
grigson
could
have
any
adversarial
purpose
whatsoever.
certainly
no
one
told
him
that
his
comments
to
the
doctor
could
and
would
literally
be
used
to
try
to
kill
him
or
that
in
view
of
that
awesome
consequence
of
this
encounter
he
had
a
right
not
to
say
anything
and
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
attorney
who'd
been
representing
him
for
the
past
four
months.
now--
mr.
joel
berger
--long
after
it
had
actually
occurred.
it
was
sometime
during
the
jury
selection
process
which
began,
i
believe,
march
11
and
ran
through
march
25.
a
curious
thing
about
the
state's
position,
as
i
read
it,
is
that
they
are
saying
that
all
of
these
capital
defendants
who
have
been
examined
by
dr.
grigson
and
others...
and
altogether
there
are
30
cases
that
i'm
aware
of;
dr.
grigson
has
testified
in
20;
altogether
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
affirmed
62,
to
date,
so
we
have
psychiatric
testimony
in
about
half
of
them,
dr.
grigson
in
about
one-third
of
them.
the
state
is
of
the
view
that
all
of
these
defendants,
these
capital
defendants,
have
absolutely
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
when
faced
with
a
psychiatrist
under
these
circumstances.
taken
literally,
this
means
that
in
their
view
a
capital
defendant
could
be
compelled
to
provide
the
very
evidence
through
which
the
state
will
seek
his
execution.
mr.
joel
berger
that
would
logically
follow
also;
yes.
they're
saying
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
privilege,
that
upon
conviction...
i
must
point
out
that
this
interview
took
place
before
conviction.
but
leaving
that
aside
for
a
moment,
we
can
treat
that
in
a
lengthy
footnote
in
our
brief.
they're
saying
that
the
state
can
require
a
capital
defendant
to
submit
to
examination
by
a
psychiatrist
knowing
full
well
that
that
psychiatrist
will
then
recommend
whether
or
not
he's
fit
to
live.
mr.
joel
berger
yes,
i
don't
think
they
have
really
addressed
that
very
much
in
their
brief
at
all
if...
we
have
a
highly
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
here;
i
can't
think
of
a
more
critical
moment
in
the
history
of
this
case.
mr.
joel
berger
i
think
that
what
would
probably
happen
in
a
situation
like
that,
defense
counsel
felt
there
was
a
real
need,
a
strong
need
for
a
competency
exam
to
be
conducted.
mr.
joel
berger
i
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
real
need
for
a
competency
exam
defense
counsel
would
do
well
to
urge
the
court
to
bar
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist
who
does
the
competency
exam,
bar
that
psychiatrist
from
testifying
at--
mr.
joel
berger
--oh,
no.
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
joel
berger
oh,
no,
i
don't
mean
it's
the...
i
just
meant
it
was
the
end
of
the
question
of...
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
joel
berger
oh,
no,
of
course
i'm
not
saying
they
can't
try
him.
what
they
can
do,
the
obvious
solution,
is
to
simply
say
that
the
doctor
who
performs
the
competency
examination,
if
there
is
a
very
strong
need
for
a
competency
exam,
that
doctor
cannot
then
testify--
mr.
joel
berger
--i
believe
that
they
are,
yes,
and
unless
there
is
some
overwhelming
evidence
of
which
one
does
need
a
psychiatrist's
testimony
that
might
show
that
he's
incompetent
anyhow
if
he's
doing
all
kinds
of
strange
things,
i
suppose.
mr.
joel
berger
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
the
case.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
his
reasons
for
failing
to
speak
to
the
doctor,
but
in
any
event
i
do
know
that
he
certainly
by
requesting...
if
you...
let's
look
at
it
the
other
way
around.
if
he
were
to
request
a
competency
exam,
which
is
his
right
under
the
due
process
clause,
i
can
certainly...
that
would
not
mean
that
he
waives
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
with
respect
to
the
penalty
phase.
and
that's
a
very
important
point
because
it
comes
up
in
some
other
texas
cases.
here
there
was
no
request.
to
get
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
here
there
was
no
request
for
a
competency
exam,
there
was
no
request
for
a
sanity
exam.
defense
counsel
had
never
at
any
time
raised
the
question
of
alleged
incompetence
or
insanity
of
this
defendant.
mr.
joel
berger
yes,
and
if
it's
only
going
to
be
used
for
competency,
then
the
law
is
clear
that
it
is
a
purely
benign,
neutral,
nonadversarial
proceeding.
the
problem
is
where
that
examination
is
then
turned
around
and
used
to
get
the
defendant
executed.
that's
the
problem
we're
concerned
with
here.
now,
i
must
point
out
that
under
texas
law
the
state
has
the
burden
at
the
penalty
phase.
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
certain
statutorily
specified
facts
as
a
precondition
to
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
and
of
particular
relevance
to
this
case,
the
state
has
to
prove
on
its
own
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
unanimous
jury
that
there
is
a
probability
that
this
defendant
would
engage
in
future
criminal
acts
of
violence
that
would
be
a
danger
to
society.
that
was
their
burden,
and
the
state
is
saying
that
they
can
require
the
defendant
to
help
the
state
meet
that
burden
out
of
his
own
mouth?
surely
the
fifth
amendment
protects
against
that.
mr.
joel
berger
that's
a
much
more
difficult
question.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
that
in
its
opinion
and
said
they
really
weren't
sure.
you
know,
perhaps
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
but
we
know
that
here,
in
fact,
he
examined
mr.
smith,
mr.
smith
made
statements,
the
statements
were
used.
incidentally,
i
should
point
out,
although
our
case
is
not
based
purely
on
the
use
of
the
statements
themselves
or
rather
the
inferences
the
doctor
drew
from
them
that
it
is
not
true
that
on
every
occasion
that
dr.
grigson
testified
to
specific
statements
that
the
door
was
opened
by
defense
counsel.
you'll
find
at
least
one
inference
on
page
33
of
the
appendix,
towards
the
end
of
the
examination,
where
dr.
grigson
on
his
own
volunteered
some
statements
that
mr.
smith
had
allegedly
made.
but,
apart
from
that,
the
doctor
drew
all
of
his
diagnosis
from
smith's
comments,
from
what
smith
said
to
him,
and
apparently
from
what
smith
supposedly
did
not
say
to
him.
that
certainly
does
present
a
very
serious
fifth
amendment
problem
and
also,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
because
of
the
time
in
which
it
occurred,
raises
questions
under
a
host
of
sixth
amendment
cases,
massiah,
brewer
v.
williams,
just
last
term
united
states
v.
henry,
the
need
for
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
this
circumstance.
after
all,
i'll
admit
that
without
the
sixth
amendment
aspects
of
this
decision,
the
defendant
might
be
somewhat
confused
by
the
warnings
he
was
given.
mr.
joel
berger
i
do
not
read
their
opinion
as
going
that
far
and
of
course
this
court's
opinion
in
brewer
v.
williams
does
not
go
that
far.
you'll
notice
that
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joel
berger
--i'm
not
going
that
far
because
this
court
as
i
read
brewer
v.
williams
has
not
gone
that
far,
and
that's
one
reason
why
there's
a
need
for
warnings.
mr.
joel
berger
there
isn't.
mr.
joel
berger
oh,
obviously,
obviously
not.
i
think
also
that
certainly
there
would
be
the
heaviest
of
all
conceivable
burdens
upon
the
state
to
show
a
genuine
waiver.
i'm
just
saying
that
under
brewer
as
i
read
it
at
this
moment
this
court
has
left
that
matter
open.
you'll
notice,
incidentally,
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
very
word
from
the
constitution,
"assistance"
of
counsel;
did
not
go
any
farther
than
that.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
in
using
the
word
"assistance"
that
they
meant
to
impose
some
new
rule
that
can't
be
waived
without
notice
to
counsel,
a
rule
not
yet
adopted
by
this
court.
i
might
only
conclude
by
pointing
out
that
25
years
ago
dean
griswold
wrote
in
"the
fifth
amendment
today",
"we
do
not
require
people
to
sign
their
own
death
warrants
or
to
dig
their
own
graves.
"
and
i
think
he
said
that
at
the
height
of
the
mccarthy
period
in
1954
for
a
very
special
reason.
he
wanted
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
that,
he
felt,
was
the
perfect
illustration,
and
so
it
is.
mr.
joel
berger
thank
you.
