justice
rehnquist
ms.
ashton,
you
said
that
there
were
psychiatrists
who
testified
for
the
defense
as
to
the
absence
of
the
probability
of
recidivism
or
future
danger.
do
they
testify
that
it
is
simply
beyond
the
ken
of
psychiatry,
or
that
it
is
within
the
ken
of
psychiatry
but
that
with
respect
to
this
particular
defendant,
he
is
not
going
to
be
a
danger?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
berger,
when
you
say
"prosecution-oriented
psychiatrist",
aren't
all
expert
witnesses
oriented
toward
the
side
that
calls
them,
in
effect?
you
don't
call
an
expert
witness
who's
going
to
damage
your
case.
justice
rehnquist
they
didn't
call
him
as
a
witness
in
the
case
in
chief,
did
they?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
berger,
what
if
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment
orders
a
competency
hearing
for
the
accused
and
the
accused
simply
says,
i
decline
to
speak
with
any
psychiatrist,
does
that
prevent
any
further
proceedings
in
the
case?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
defense
counsel
said,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
let
my
client
speak
with
any
psychiatrist?
justice
rehnquist
your
position,
then,
ultimately,
leaves
the
fact
that
someone
charged
with
capital
murder
can
effectively
frustrate
that
charge
by
simply
refusing
to
submit
to
a
competency
hearing
before
there
is
ever
a
trial
on
the
guilt
or
innocence--
justice
rehnquist
but
some
of
our
cases
have
held
the
trial
judge
on
his
own
motion
has
to
order
an
exam,
haven't
they?
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the
report
was
placed
in
the
court
file,
is
it
common
practice
in
texas
for
attorneys
to
run
through
the
file
rather
than
rely
on
a
witness
list
or
documents
served
on
them?
justice
rehnquist
ms.
ashton,
if
a
state
passed
a
statute
that
said
in
a
capital
case
in
the
second
part
of
a
bifurcated
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
gets
death
is
determined
by
a
psychiatrist.
would
that
be
allowed
by
due
process?
