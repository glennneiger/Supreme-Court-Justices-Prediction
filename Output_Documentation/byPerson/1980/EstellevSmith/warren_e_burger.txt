chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
estelle
v.
ernest
benjamin
smith.
ms.
ashton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
is
there
any
practice
in
texas
as
distinguished
from
the
rule
in
the
texas
courts
as
to
furnishing
notice
of
witnesses
to
the
adverse
party
before
the
case
opens?
chief
justice
burger
there
are
some
psychiatrists
who
consistently
and
regularly
testify
for
the
defense,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
burger
not
only
in
dallas
but--
chief
justice
burger
--all
over
the
country?
chief
justice
burger
was
not
the
genesis
of
this
caution
about
prediction
based
on...
if
you
know...
many
situations
where
psychiatrists
testified
that
there
was
no
future
danger
and
then
very
quickly
it
was
found
that
that
was
erroneous
and
then
psychiatrists
began
to
retreat
from
predictions;
at
least
some
of
them
did?
chief
justice
burger
well,
as
the
case
comes
here,
i
had
understood
that
the
two
issues
were
whether
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
to
fail
to
give
notice
of
dr.
grigson's
testimony,
that
he
would
testify;
and
second,
that
the
constitution
required
that
before
any
interview
material
could
be
used,
that
the
defendant
had
to
be
informed
that
the
information
might
be
used
against
him.
i
thought
those
were
the
only
two
issues
presented
here.
chief
justice
burger
you've
addressed
one
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
there
a
death
sentence
outstanding
now?
chief
justice
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
constitutionally
whether
it
was
inadvertent
or
deliberate?
chief
justice
burger
on
the
due
process.
chief
justice
burger
this
case
i'm
talking
about.
in
this
case
it
would
have
made
no
difference
whether
it
was
inadvertent
or
calculated.
chief
justice
burger
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
defense
counsel
calling
a
psychiatrist
who
was
not
known
to
testify
favorably
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
burger
often?
do
they
ever
do
it
otherwise?
i
have
sat
on
hundreds
of
appeals
and
tried,
as
a
trial
judge,
cases
and
i
never
knew
of
a
case
where
defense
counsel
called
a
hostile
witness
any
more
than
the
prosecution,
so
that
your
point,
really,
is
an
unnecessary
point
and
not
grounded
on
any
facts,
and
it
isn't
relevant
to
your
constitutional
arguments.
chief
justice
burger
did
he
ask
for
any
more?
did
he
ask
for
a
day
or
two
days;
continuance?
chief
justice
burger
was
there
any
reference
in
the
opinion
to
the
fact
that
defense
counsel
did
not
ask
for
a
continuance?
chief
justice
burger
if
the
defense
had
called
a
rebuttal
witness
on
the
subject,
a
psychiatrist
who
said
that
having
examined
this
gentleman
he
would
be
perfectly
safe
and
would
be
a
good
citizen
and
would
not
repeat
his
prior
conduct,
the
american
psychiatric
association
position
would
apply
exactly
the
same
with
reference
to
that
prediction,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
when
did
the
defense
counsel
first
know
of
the
examination?
chief
justice
burger
does
that
refusal
to
submit
to
an
examination
and
answer
questions
constitute
a
waiver
of
any
future
claim
of
lack
of
competency,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
it
would
violate
his
constitutional
rights
if
the
psychiatrist
simply
went
to
the
institution
where
he
was
incarcerated
and
then
observed
him
for
two
or
three
days,
even
without
having
any
responses
coming
from
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
ashton?
chief
justice
burger
well,
he
claimed
surprise,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
wasn't
that
equivalent
to
claiming
surprise?
chief
justice
burger
if
while
incarcerated
he
had
boasted
to
the
jailor
about
the
crime
and
said
if
he
had
the
opportunity
he
would
do
it
over
again,
would
that
be
admissible
under
texas
law
in
the
second
phase
of
the
proceeding?
chief
justice
burger
so
that
you're
putting
the
statements
to
dr.
grigson
in
the
same
category
as
voluntary
statements
made
to
a
third
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
