justice
blackmun
does
that
psychiatric
testimony,
general
ashton,
go
beyond
that,
however?
justice
blackmun
then
i
take
it
that
the
state
doesn't
agree
with
the
observations
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
psychiatric
association
that
this
kind
of
testimony
as
to
predictive
behavior
is
unreliable?
justice
blackmun
it
seems
a
little
strange,
doesn't
it,
for
the
apa
to
be
taking
an
opposing
position?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
how
can
you
predict
future
behavior
by
way
of
recidivism?
do
you
know?
justice
blackmun
but
at
least
dr.
grigson
thought
he
could?
justice
blackmun
dr.
grigson
is
one
of
the
favorites,
isn't
he?
justice
blackmun
and
testifying.
justice
blackmun
mr.
berger,
you
had
subpoenaed
the
records
of
dr.
grigson's
visit
to
smith,
had
you
not?
justice
blackmun
the
defense
side
did,
then?
justice
blackmun
what
does
that
do
to
the
claim
of
surprise?
justice
blackmun
at
this
point,
ms.
ashton,
could
the
state
have
called
smith,
at
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial?
justice
blackmun
well,
then
you're
abandoning
part
of
your--
--in
the
face
of
that
answer,
how
does
that
square
with
your
argument
that
fifth
amendment
does
not
apply
at
the
penalty
phase?
justice
blackmun
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
in
the
texas
procedure?
suppose...
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
state
need
not
present
any
evidence
at
this.
it
could
rely
on
what
came
in
in
the
guilt
phase.
justice
blackmun
suppose
the
state
did
not
present
any
evidence
and
then
the
defense,
as
i
think
in
this
case,
presented
no
evidence,
could
the
state
then
call
dr.
grigson?
justice
blackmun
so
there
are
some
rules
that
apply
in
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial--
justice
blackmun
--even
though
you
say
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
a--
