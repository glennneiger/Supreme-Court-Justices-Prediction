ms.
anita
ashton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
is
here
today
to
contend
that
the
use
of
psychiatric
testimony
in
the
punishment
phase
of
a
capital
murder
trial
is
proper
and
is
necessary
to
allow
the
jury
to
have
all
relevant
information
concerning
the
character
of
a
defendant,
especially
when
the
jury
is
making
this
important
determination
as
to
life
or
death.
this
testimony
is
used
only
after
a
finding
of
guilt
in
a
capital
murder
trial.
it
is
not
used
for
the
purpose
of
incriminating
the
defendant
or
as
to
any
issue
of
guilt
for
the
offense.
it
is
merely
as
to
determining
his
mental
status
at
the
time
that
he
committed
the
crime
and
his
mental
status
so
that
the
jury
may
take
that
factor
into
consideration
in
making
the
determination
of
future
dangerousness,
which
is
one
of
the
questions
which
the
jury
must
answer
under
the
texas
capital
punishment
statute.
testimony
of
this
type
has
been
used
in
the
state
of
texas
historically
in
murder
prosecutions
from
the
beginning
of
this
century
pursuant
to
section
1906
of
the
texas
penal
code.
in
a
murder
prosecution
both
the
state
and
the
defendant
may
introduce
all
relevant
evidence
as
to
the
defendant's
mental
status
so
that
the
jury
may
have
this
evidence
before
them
in
determining
the
appropriate
punishment
for
a
crime.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not
but
the
statute
has
been
carried
over
from
the
beginning.
under
the
old
"murder
with
malice"
is
when
it
was
originated,
when
there
was
one
proceeding,
not
a
bifurcated
proceeding.
but
when
the
bifurcated
proceedings--
ms.
anita
ashton
--no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
bifurcated
proceeding
prior
to
this
statute,
beginning
in
1965,
the
1965
code.
this
particular
statute
of
capital
murder
was
enacted
in
1973.
so
during
the
period
of
time
between
1965
and
1973
in
all
murder
with
malice
trials
this
evidence
wasn't.
ms.
anita
ashton
there
was
a
single,
a
unitary
trial,
not
a
bifurcated
trial.
ms.
anita
ashton
evidence
as
to
mental
status
could
be
used
as
to
guilt.
ms.
anita
ashton
but
it
was
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
punishment
under
the
statutory
provisions.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor,
there
were
generally
instructions.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes.
the
mental
status...
depending
on
the
way
the
issue
was
introduced
for
the
defense,
if
they'd
introduced
it
as--
ms.
anita
ashton
--if
the
prosecution
introduced
the
evidence,
it
would
be
limited
as
to
punishment,
not
as
to
guilt.
the
same
statute
provides
for
the
use
of
introducing
evidence
as
to
the
deceased's
character
in
prior
altercations
between
the
deceased
and
the
defendant,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
or
the
deceased
were
acting
in
passion
or
were
cruel
or
were
agitated
at
the
same
time.
it's
that
type
of
a
statute.
ms.
anita
ashton
if
the
counsel
requests
a
list
of
witness
and
it
is
so
ordered
by
the
court,
it
is
provided,
but
it
is
depending
upon
the
type
of
order.
in
this
particular
case
the
witness
list
provided
that
the
witnesses
be
listed
if
known
at
that
time.
the
witness
list
was
filed
on
the
11th,
trial
began
on
the
25th,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
time,
the
first
time
that
dr.
grigson
was
contacted
as
a
witness
was
on
the
21st,
ten
days
after
the
witness
list
had
been
filed.
in
a
trial
in
capital
murder
cases,
generally
the
prosecution
introduces
evidence
of
prior
crimes
if
known,
if
they
are
available;
sometimes
they're
not
available.
the
prosecution
now
under
some
texas
decisions
can
under
texas
law
clearly
introduce
evidence
of
extraneous
offenses,
of
crimes.
if
they
are
proven
up,
they
have
to
be
proven
up
during
the
punishment
stage.
it's
not
merely
reading
from
an
arrest
sheet.
they
must
prove
up
the
crimes
with
competent
evidence.
and
they
often
use
psychiatric
testimony.
psychiatric
testimony
can
be
used
by
both
the
state
or
by
the
defendant.
in
fact,
reversible
error
results
in
the
texas
system
if
the
defendant
is
prohibited
from
introducing
psychiatric
testimony
as
to
his
ability
to
be
rehabilitated.
there
was
a
texas
case
of
robinson
v.
state
specifically
on
that
point.
both
the
state
and
prosecution
have
this
right
to
present
this
type
of
evidence
as
to
the
mental
status
of
the
defendant.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
generally
in
the
context
it's
used,
the
state
uses
it
if
a
psychiatrist
or
psychologist
has
determined
that
the
defendant
has
a
sociopathic
personality
or
an
antisocial
personality
and
will
continue
to
commit
crimes.
now,
in
the
particular
case,
in
the
manner
in
which
the
testimony
was
presented,
the
psychiatrist
testified
that
he
was
a
sociopathic
personality.
one
of
the
features
of
the
sociopathic
personality
was
a
lack
of
remorse...
that
he
found
a
lack
of
remorse
in
this
particular
defendant,
ernest
benjamin
smith.
it
was
on
cross-examination
by
smith's
counsel
where
he
asked
him,
what
statements
did
the
defendant
make
to
you
to
bring
you
to
this
conclusion
that
the
defendant
had
an
antisocial
personality?
and
then
statements
that
had
been
made
to
the
psychiatrist
by
the
defendant
were
brought
into
evidence
as
a
result
of
that
questioning
by
defense
counsel.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
we
think
that
it
is
a
factor
that
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
it
is
a
type
of
evidence
like
any
other
expert
witness
that
is
subject
to
cross-examination
and
subject
to
impeachment
and
is
one
factor
for
the
jury
to
consider.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
american
psychiatric
association
reflects
the
viewpoint
of
some
psychiatrists
with
that
association.
the
state
of
texas
believes
that
it
is
not
necessarily
reflective
of
all
psychiatrists
in
america,
no
more
so
than
a
brief
filed
by
the
american
bar
association
would
be
reflective
of
all
the
attorneys
in
america.
it
is
a
brief
submitting
the
viewpoint
of
a
segment
of
their
profession
as
to
predicting
future
dangerousness,
or
future
behavior.
but
as
is
pointed
out
in
many
writings
in
the
area,
future
behavior
is
something
that
psychiatrists,
and
in
fact,
all
medical
doctors
are
trained
to
predict
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
profession.
if
they
see
someone
that
has
a
fever
they
are
going
to
predict
that
they
are
going
to
be
sick.
if
they
give
them
a
certain
type
of
medication,
they
are
going
to
predict
that
they
are
going
to
become
well.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
i'm
not
trained
in
the
area
of
psychiatry.
if
you
are
trained
in
that
area,
certainly
there
are
some
personality
types
which
apparently
can
be
diagnosed,
although--
ms.
anita
ashton
--no,
your
honor,
not
just
dr.
grigson.
dr.
grigson
is
not
the
only
psychiatrist
that
testifies
like
this
in
texas.
there
are
over
20
psychiatrists
that
i
am
familiar
with
that
have
testified
as
to
this
type
of
future
dangerous
behavior
for
the
state.
there
are
also
psychiatrists
that
testify
as
to
the
lack
of
future
dangerous
behavior
on
behalf
of
defense
counsel
and
testimony
of
this
nature
is
presented
throughout
the
country
in
capital
murder
trials
in
the
context
of
negating
the
mitigating
circumstance
of
rehabilitation,
oftentimes.
ms.
anita
ashton
well,
your
honor,
he
has
had
more
experience
in
doing
criminal
examinations
than
probably
any
other
psychiatrist
in
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
anita
ashton
and
has
testified
numerous
times.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
he
testifies
in
most
of
the
capital
cases
in
dallas
and
in
that
surrounding
northeastern
part
of
texas.
in
houston
he
rarely
testifies
nor...
he
has
testified
on
about
two
occasions
in
san
antonio.
it
depends
upon
the
location
of
the
trial
whether
or
not
they
use
dr.
grigson
or
another
psychiatrist.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
--throughout
the
state.
ms.
anita
ashton
and
the
country.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
some
of
the
articles
that
i
have
read
have
indicated
that
particular
thinking
within
some
members
of
the
profession,
especially
when,
after
a
period
of
time
where
they
did
not
predict
future
dangerousness,
a
very
violent
crime
resulted
as
a
result
of
a
person
not
being
incarcerated
for
future
dangerous
behavior.
ms.
anita
ashton
generally
they
testify
as
to
the
latter.
they
can
predict
future
dangerousness
and
that
this
defendant
will
not
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
there
are
also
some
psychiatrists
and
psychologist
that
testify
that
you
simply
cannot
predict
future
behavior.
that
type
of
testimony
is
generally
used
when
they
can't
find
a
psychiatrist
to
come
in
and
testify
that
this
particular
defendant
will
not
be
dangerous
in
the
future,
as
rebuttal
testimony.
ms.
anita
ashton
of
the
defendant's
testimony,
your
honor?
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
present
an
issue,
i
believe,
as
to--
ms.
anita
ashton
--your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
went
on
in
the
second
portion
of
the
opinion,
though,
to
state
that
in
the
event
of
the
retrial
that
the
testimony
could
not
be
used.
ms.
anita
ashton
well,
the
way
it
was--
ms.
anita
ashton
--well,
your
honor,
the
interpretation
that
i
had
of
the
second
portion
of
the
opinion
said
they
were
indicating
that
anytime
a
psychiatrist
was
court-appointed
and
went
in
to
talk
to
a
defendant
and
his
testimony
might
conceivably
be
used
during
the
punishment
stage
of
a
trial,
that
that
psychiatrist
must
warn
the
defendant
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent,
a
right
to--
ms.
anita
ashton
--yes,
your
honor,
but
previous
to
that
time
there's
not
been
that
standard
of
warning
for
a
psychiatrist
to
give
to
the
defendant.
ms.
anita
ashton
no;
their
brief
goes
to
the
ultimate
issue
of
presenting
this
type
of
testimony.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
give
you
one
capital
murder
case
in
which
he
did
not--
ms.
anita
ashton
--court...
presently?
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
the
cases
that
have
been
in
this
court
and
are
currently
pending
in
this
court
in
which
dr.
grigson
has
testified,
the
testimony
is
all
as
to
a
sociopathic
personality.
he
has
testified
in
the
same
manner.
it
has
not
been
the
only
testimony--
ms.
anita
ashton
--he
uses
approximately
the
same
words
for
his
diagnosis--
ms.
anita
ashton
--if
it's
a
similar
diagnosis.
it
is
not
necessarily
the
only
evidence
that
has
been
used
in
the
punishment
stage
of
all
the
trials,
though.
the
findings
of
dr.
grigson
have
been
used
both
to
help
a
defendant
as
well
as
to
help
the
prosecution.
in
the
cases
where
dr.
grigson
has
examined
defendants
and
other
psychiatrists
have
examined
defendants,
and
they
have
found
that
there
is
not
a
sociopathic
personality
trait.
generally
the
district
attorney's
office
refuses
to
seek
an
indictment
for
a
capital
offense
because
in
texas
one
of
the
very
first
steps
is
a
denial
of
bond
in
a
capital
offense.
in
order
to
deny
bond
the
proof
must
be
evidence,
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
that
not
only
will
a
conviction
result
for
capital
murder
but
that
affirmative
answers
will
result
to
all
three
special
issues.
ms.
anita
ashton
that's
correct.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
part
of
this
record.
the
cases
in
which
the
state
does
not
seek
an
indictment
do
not
become
a
part
of
an
official
court
record.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
we
have
not
had
evidentiary
hearings
in
any
court
on
this.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
they
were
presented
by
purpose
of
a...
in
this
particular
case,
in
a
shotgun
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which--
ms.
anita
ashton
--in
the
state
courts,
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
to
the
trial
court
approximately
i
believe
it
was
four
or
five
days
before
an
execution
was
scheduled
to
take
place
for
this
defendant.
the
relief
was
denied
summarily
in
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
they
have
been
presented
by
indirect
appeal
in
some
other
cases.
ms.
anita
ashton
well,
the
court
has
found,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
found
that
there
is
no
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
right
as
to
psychiatric
testimony.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor,
they
would
have
been
open.
ms.
anita
ashton
they
denied
them.
ms.
anita
ashton
technically
the
state
remedies
have
been
exhausted.
the
state
is
of
the
opinion
in
this
particular
case
that
the
district
court
opinion
went
further
than
the
pleadings
that
were
filed
in
the
case
as
to
setting
forth
the
issues
involved.
therefore
the
state
courts
were
not
given
an
opportunity
to
fully
analyze
and
have
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
issues
as
were
decided
by
the
federal
district
court.
ms.
anita
ashton
well,
yes,
your
honor,
they
have
not
been,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
technical
allegation
was
that
it
was
copied
verbatim
from
one
petition
to
the
other.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
because
of
the
decision
subsequent
to
decision
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
holding
that
there
is
not
a
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
right
to
psychiatric
testimony
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
i
feel
that
it
would
be
futile
to
bring
the
claims
as
presented
to
the
federal
district
court
in
this
claim.
therefore,
exhaustion
is
not
a
ground
that
i
feel
is
strongly
stressed
in
this
particular
case
under
the
facts
in
which
it
arose.
ms.
anita
ashton
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
as
to
the--
ms.
anita
ashton
--yes,
your
honor.
the
latter
is
based
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
the
former,
of
the
denial
of
due
process,
the
state
strongly
contends
and
still
contends
that
there
is
a
need
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
to
that
issue
to
fully
develop
the
record.
we
believe
that
the
record
has
never
been
fully
developed
as
to
a
finding
that
the
state
deliberately
omitted
the
psychiatrist's
name
from
the
list
and
deliberately
acted
so
as
to
deny
due
process
to
the
defendant
in
the
manner
in
which
the
testimony
was
presented.
all
right.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
in
regard
to
the
surprise
issues
and
a
continuance,
under
texas
law
historically
and
it
is
well
established
that
a
counsel
if
he
is
in
fact
surprised
must
move
for
a
continuance
from
the
trial
judge.
contrary
to
mr.
berger's
statements,
the
trial
judge...
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
the
trial
judge
knew
that
the
defense
attorney
was
surprised.
the
defense
attorney
had
taken
dr.
grigson
on
voir
dire
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
establish
the
fact
that
his
name
was
not
on
the
witness
list.
he
never
said,
i'm
surprised,
i
want
a
continuance,
i
haven't
had
a--
ms.
anita
ashton
--the
judge
gave
an
hour
recess
and
said,
is
that
agreeable?
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
trial
judges
frequently
give
recess
during
the
presentation
of
testimony
for
one
reason
or
another.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record--
ms.
anita
ashton
--he
may
have,
your
honor,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
that
was
the
reason
that
he
did
so.
ms.
anita
ashton
he
claimed
that
the
name
was
not
on
a
witness
list.
he
did
not--
ms.
anita
ashton
--your
honor,
there
are
facts
in
the
record...
first
of
all,
the
subpoena
that
was
issued
indicates
that
he
knew
dr.
grigson
had
examined
his
client
and
obviously
gave
some
consideration
to
the
fact
or
he
would
not
have
requested
the
subpoena
for
the
visitation
records.
secondly,
this
counsel,
this
was
not
the
first
capital
case
tried
in
dallas
nor
was
it
the
first
capital
case
in
which
this
counsel
had
defended.
he
had
defended
william
david
hovila
a
month
before
in
dallas
county
and
dr.
grigson
had
testified
during
hovila's
trial
as
to
sociopathic
personality
features,
although
there
had
been
an
issue
of
sanity
raised
in
that
trial.
still,
dr.
grigson
had
given
testimony
extremely
similar
to
the
testimony
given
in
the
smith
case
and
was
cross-examined
by
this
same
trial
counsel
one
month
previously.
further,
he
said
the
defendant
himself
knew
he
had
been
examined
by
dr.
grigson,
and
surely
told
his
counsel
that
the
psychiatrist
had
talked
to
him,
but
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
that
the
defendant
had
given
that
information
to
counsel;
i'm
making
an
assumption
from
the
record.
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
the
state
feels
that
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
should
have
been
conducted
as
to
the
issue
of
due
process
and
surprise
in
order
to
have
all
of
the
facts
in
the
record,
to
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
defense
attorney
as
to
his
statements
in
his
affidavit,
for
many
statements
could
not
be
disproven
any
other
way
than
on
cross-examination
from
him
from
the
witness
stand.
an
affidavit
was
submitted
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
stated
that
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
he
had
informed
defense
counsel,
there
had
been
no
written
notification...
at
that
time
statutory
practice
did
not
require
written
notification.
the
report
from
dr.
grigson
had
been
placed
in
the
court's
file,
was
available
to
either
side
for
review.
the
prosecution
talked
to
dr.
grigson;
there
was
nothing
to
prohibit
the
defense
counsel
from
talking
to
dr.
grigson;
he
was
appointed
as
a
disinterested
expert
by
the
court.
the
defense
could
have
gone
to
him
and
talked
to
him
if
they
had
gone
through
the
court
file
or
had
given
preparation
in
that
regard.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
common
practice
for
attorneys
to
look
at
a
court's
file
fairly
frequently,
especially
when
they're
trying
a
capital-type
case,
that
the
court's
file
is
something
that
is
open
to
either
side
and
is
going
to
have
information
in
it
as
to
subpoenas,
as
to
other
materials,
communications
with
the
court.
it's
a
fairly
common
practice
in
trial
practice
to
look
through
the
court's
file
on
a
relatively
frequent
basis,
especially
in
preparing
for
a
case
of
this
nature.
ms.
anita
ashton
if
that...
the
ultimate
issue
would
have
to
be
determined
by
a
psychiatrist?
ms.
anita
ashton
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
under
the
context
of
having
an
expert
witness
make
an
ultimate
factual
determination
without
giving
the
jury
consideration
as
to
all
the
facts
of
the
trial,
i
believe
that
probably
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
but
that
is
not
the
statute,
it
is
not
the
way
it
is
written.
the
state
does
not
have
to
present
any
testimony.
the
state
can
rely
only
on
the
testimony
that
they
presented
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial;
all
of
the
facts
are
before
the
jury
for
consideration.
in
calling
dr.
grigson
to
the
stand
as
a
psychiatrist
he
was
called
as
a
rebuttal
witness
in
the
order
that
the
witnesses
were
presented,
though
we
contend
that
he
was
not
available
to
testify
initially.
the
state
was
under
no
obligation
to
call
him
as
a
rebuttal
witness.
it
could
have
relied
strictly
on
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
in
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial
where
the
defendant
had
testified,
where
his
oral
confession
had
come
in
and
where
there
had
been
testimony
from
the
police
officer
who
had
witnessed
the
oral
confession
that
the
defendant
showed
no
remorse
upon
questioning
by
defense
counsel
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
seemed
emotional
or
seemed
to
regret
the
crime.
additionally,
the
defendant
in
this
case
could
have
taken
the
stand
in
the
punishment
stage
of
the
trial
and
testified
that
he
was
sorry
about
the
murder,
that
he
regretted
the
fact
that
william
moon
was
no
longer
alive,
that
if
he
could
have
he
would
have
stopped
it.
but
he
did
not
take
it.
his
counsel
did
ask
him
about
regrets
during
the
guilt
phase--
ms.
anita
ashton
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
probably
could
have
called
smith
to
force
him
to
testify;
no.
ms.
anita
ashton
your
honor,
although
you
could
not
force
a
person
to
give
testimony
from
his
mouth,
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
apply
to
prohibit
use
of
testimony
which
has,
serves
as
a
basis
for
an
opinion
which
has
been
rendered;
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
go
as
to
those
statements
made
by
the
defendant
after
he's
been
found
guilty
as
to
statements
of
guilt,
especially
in
circumstances
where
he
has
given
the
same
testimony
in
the
court
as
to
the
facts
of
the
offense.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
not
necessarily
because
they
are
voluntary,
but
they
are
made
to
a
court-appointed
expert,
but
he
is
not
serving
as
an
official
of
law
enforcement.
his
purpose
was
not
to
gather
incriminating
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
conviction.
his
purpose
was
to
evaluate
mental
status.
he
as
a
result
of
the
examination
gained
some
knowledge
of
the
crime,
but
his
knowledge
of
the
crime
was
not
used
for
the
purpose
of
conviction.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
no,
your
honor.
the
state
rested,
and
the
defense
rested
without
presenting
any
evidence
whatsoever.
the
state
could
not...
they
already...
they'd
had
their
one
chance
to
present
evidence.
if
the
defense
chose
not
to
present
any,
they
could
not
present
any
further
evidence.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
anita
ashton
the
state
could
not
have
used
dr.
grigson's
testimony
because
under
the
statute,
under
4602,
which
provides
for
psychiatric,
court-appointed
psychiatric
examinations
in
a
criminal
trial,
it
specifically
states
that
no
evidence
may
be
used
as
to
the
issue
of
guilt.
