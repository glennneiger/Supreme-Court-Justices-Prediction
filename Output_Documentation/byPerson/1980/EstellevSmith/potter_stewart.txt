justice
stewart
has
texas
had
a
bifurcated
proceeding
since
the
beginning
of
this
century?
justice
stewart
so
until
the
present
statute
this
kind
of
evidence
went
in
to
this
jury
that
determined
guilt?
justice
stewart
but
from
the
beginning
of
the
century
until
1965?
justice
stewart
therefore
this
sort
of
evidence
that
you
said
has
traditionally
been--
justice
stewart
--as
to
guilt?
justice
stewart
were
there
any
instructions?
justice
stewart
limited
to
the
determination
of
punishment?
justice
stewart
no,
no.
this
is
the
prosecution
introducing
it.
justice
stewart
and
in
smith,
according
to
the
jurek
opinion
or
an
opinion
in
jurek,
there
was
offered
in
evidence
the
conclusion
of
a
psychiatrist
that
smith
had
a
sociopathic
personality
and
that
his
patterns
of
conduct
would
be
the
same
in
the
future
as
they
had
been
in
the
past.
do
you
happen
to
know
if
that
was
the
same
psychiatrist
as
the
one
involved
here?
justice
stewart
that's
this
case?
justice
stewart
that
still
doesn't
show
that
mr.
justice
white's
hypothetical
isn't
correct,
as
the
cases
in
which
he's
testified
are,
would
be
the
25
hypothetical
cases
in
which
he
found
that
the
defendant
was
a
sociopath.
justice
stewart
there's
no
dispute,
i
gather,
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
dr.
grigson
examined
the
respondent.
justice
stewart
that
is,
he
was
requested
by
the
trial
judge
in
advance
of
the
trial
to
do
so
on
the
judge's
own
motion?
justice
stewart
and
now
is
it
your
claim
that
there
was
something
improper
about
that?
justice
stewart
i
think
there
are
indications
in
some
of
this
court's
opinions
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
trial
judge
to
do
that.
justice
stewart
and
that
was
done
without
notice
to
the
defense
counsel?
justice
stewart
well,
in
any
event
those
claims
were
considered
on
their
merits
by
this
state
court
in
collateral--
justice
stewart
--so
whatever
the
rule
might
be,
that
was
what
was
done
in
this
case.
well,
there
wasn't
any
opinion;
it
was
denied
without
opinion.
justice
stewart
so
the
rejection
could
have
been
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
were
not
properly
there,
those
claims.
justice
stewart
they
didn't
say,
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
stewart
no.
