justice
stevens
ms.
ashton,
does
this
case
present
any
issue
with
respect
to
the
admissibility
of
this
kind
of
testimony?
justice
stevens
no;
the
psychiatrist's
testimony.
justice
stevens
i
thought
it
only
was
inadmissible...
the
court
of
appeals
was
unhappy
about
the
way
the
testimony
was
obtained
and
the
fact
there
was
no
notice
given
to
counsel.
justice
stevens
of
dr.
grigson
because
of
the
way
it
was
obtained.
justice
stevens
but
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion,
is
there,
that
would
foreclose
the
use
of
another
psychiatrist
who
would
follow
the
procedures
that
they
held
were
appropriate?
or
is
there?
maybe
i'm
missing
it.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
he
does
give
those
warnings,
his
testimony
is
admissible,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
the
issue
that
you've
been
talking
about
up
to
now
is
whether
the
testimony
is
ever
admissible.
and
i
think
everybody
assumes
it's
admissible
if
you
follow
the
procedures
that
they
require.
well,
accept
the
american
psychiatric
association.
well,
but
they
don't
define
the
questions
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
stevens
it
didn't
seem
to
me
that
was
among
the
questions
presented
to
us
for
decision;
that's
all.
is
it
true
that
in
every
case
that
dr.
grigson
examined,
he
gave
verbatim
the
same
testimony--
justice
stevens
oh,
it
stayed
its
own--
justice
stevens
even
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
he
is
defense-oriented,
would
not
your
legal
arguments
be
precisely
the
same?
justice
stevens
i
agree
with
you.
well,
yes,
but
i
would...
regardless
of
the
way
he
approaches
them,
your
legal
argument
would
be
the
same,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
--i
just
wanted
to
follow
up
on
the
same
thought
that
justice
blackmun
was
raising.
you
have
now
acknowledged,
as
i
understand
you,
that
the
state
could
not
have
compelled
the
defendant
to
testify
at
the
penalty
phase?
justice
stevens
could
the
state
have
used
dr.
grigson's
testimony
during
the
guilt
phase?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
