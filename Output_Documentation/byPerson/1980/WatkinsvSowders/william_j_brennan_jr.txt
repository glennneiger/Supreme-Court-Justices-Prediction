justice
jr.
well
let
me
understand
you,
sir.
if
the
victim
comes
to
the
trial
and
says,
that's
the
man,
pointing
to
the
accused
sitting
at
counsel
table,
no
out
of
court
proceeding
is
required
in
that
situation?
justice
jr.
i've
given
you
the
hypothetical.
the
victim
comes
and
testifies,
as
most
do,
i
take
it,
that
that
man
robbed
me,
and
so
forth--
justice
jr.
--and
as
to
that
testimony,
no
out
of
court
proceeding
is
required,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
it's
required
only
if
the
witness
gets
on
the
stand
and
says,
i
identified
this
man
at
a
show
up
on
such
and
such
a
date
at
such
and
such
a
place
or
at
a
line
up.
in
that
circumstance,
before
he
can
repeat
the
identification
in
court,
there
has
to
be
a
proceeding
such
as
you
suggest,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
fox,
did
i
understand
your
brother
to
say
that
kentucky
has
now
adopted
a
rule
governing
this
question?
justice
jr.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him.
justice
jr.
well
what
happens
at
that,
in
that
proceeding?
i
mean,
is
evidence
taken,
or
what?
justice
jr.
well
are
there
instances
in
which
the
trial
judge
in
a
suppression
hearing
will
say
yes,
i
find
that
it
was
suggestive?
justice
jr.
and
therefore,
you
may
not
use
that
evidence,
that
identification
evidence
at
trial?
