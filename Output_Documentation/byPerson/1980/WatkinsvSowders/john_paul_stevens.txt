justice
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand,
you're
just
saying,
you're
making
this
claim
in
any
case
where
you
object
to
an
identification
on
the
ground
it
was
unduly
suggestive?
justice
stevens
and
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
most
states
allow
this
kind
of
pretrial
hearing?
justice
stevens
attorney
general
fox,
isn't
there
another
consideration
which
you
at
least
think
about
in
a
case
like
this?
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
testimony
is
found
to
be
admissible.
but
supposing
you
had
show
up
testimony
that
went
in
before
the
jury
and
after
it
went
in,
the
judge
thought
it
was
unduly
suggestive
and
then
ordered
the
jury
to
disregard
it.
now
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
in
that
situation
there
would
be
a
likelihood
of
substantial
prejudice
on
the
defense?
justice
stevens
and
is
it
not
true
that
if
inadmissible
show
up
identification
testimony
went
in,
it
could
be
highly
prejudicial?
justice
stevens
and
the
purpose
of
the
pretrial
suppression
hearing
would
be
to
avoid
that
kind
of
prejudice?
justice
stevens
attorney
general
fox,
let
me
change...
just
give
you
a
hypothetical.
supposing
you
have
a
post
indictment
line
up
identification
where
there
is
a
clear
right
to
counsel.
but
say
there's
a
dispute
of
fact
as
to
whether
counsel
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
line
up
or
before
it
started,
or
something
like
that,
and
you
had
to
know
the
facts
in
order
to
know
whether
the
right,
which
admittedly
would
exist,
had
been
preserved.
under
kentucky
practice,
would
you
have
that
put
in
the
line
up
testimony
and
then
during
the
trial
decide
the
question
of
fact,
or
would
you
have
a
pretrial
suppression
hearing?
justice
stevens
then
there's
the
point
in
this
case,
that
the
evidence
was
clearly
admissible
and
therefore
there
was
no
need
for
the
hearing.
but
if
there
were
legitimate
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
allegedly
suggestive
identification,
would
you
then
say
that
the
constitution
would
require
a
pretrial
hearing?
justice
stevens
well
in
the
case
i
gave
you,
say,
i
say
you
say
you
think
they
would
allow
hearing,
would
you
say
the
constitution
would
require
it
in
that
situation?
justice
stevens
of
course,
mr.
fox,
in
jackson
against
denno,
as
i
remember
it,
there
was
evidence
other
than
the
confession,
which
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict,
but
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
due
process
required
a
separate
hearing.
so
i
guess
your
real
distinction
here
isn't
it,
is
that
the
distinction
between
the
prejudicial
effect
of
a
confession
where
the
defendant
in
effect
says
i
was
the
man,
as
opposed
to
third
party
testimony
saying
that
was
the
man;
one
is
much
more
prejudicial
than
the
other.
justice
stevens
except
that
such
a
distinction
is
drawn
by
this
court's
cases,
there
are
some
special
cases
dealing
with
identification
evidence--
justice
stevens
--there
is
no
doctrine
pertaining
to
identification
of
automobiles.
