justice
rehnquist
counsel,
did
you
make
and
preserve
this
right
to
counsel
argument
as
opposed
to
the
wade,
stovall,
denno
argument
all
through
the
kentucky
courts
into
the
district
court
in
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
rehnquist
--so
that
you
didn't
raise
the
point
in
the
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
sixth
circuit
on
a
habeas
can't
consider
a
point
that
wasn't
raised
and
considered
in
the
state
courts,
can
they?
justice
rehnquist
because
you
hadn't
raised
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
it
would
apply
outside
the
identification
field,
i
would
take
it,
because
a
trial
attorney
has
to
make
that
sort
of
determination
you're
talking
about,
how
much
did
the
prosecutor
accomplish
on
direct,
with
respect
to
every
single
witness
in
the
case,
whether
to
decline
cross
examination,
make
an
extensive
cross
examination,
or
the
like?
justice
rehnquist
would
you
extend
the
same
rule
to
the
testimony
of
a
police
officer
in
a
drug
case
who
testifies
that
yes,
this
white
substance
was
a
controlled
substance?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
logical
ground
is
there
to
separate
one
from
the
other?
justice
rehnquist
well
you're
talking
about
reliability?
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
then
that
your
argument
doesn't
apply
to
in
court
identification?
justice
rehnquist
well,
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
if
you
will.
you
simply
have
a
man
named
as
a
witness,
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
begins
testifying
about
how
he
was
in
the
bank
at
the
time.
he
doesn't,
no
one
asks
him
whether
he
has
previously
identified
the
witness,
and
then
he
is
simply
asked
the
question,
do
you
recognize
the
defendant
and
was
he
in
the
bank.
now
do
you
say
you're
entitled
to
an
in
camera
hearing
before
that?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
courts
also
distinguish
between
in
court
identification,
where
the
witness
simply
says
yes,
i
saw
that
man
in
the
bank,
and
the
question
then
asked
the
witness,
did
you
previously
identify
him,
right
after
the
robbery.
now,
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
those
two?
justice
rehnquist
so
that,
your
jackson
against
denno
hearing
would
require
it
only
where
a
witness
is
asked
about
a
proceeding
out
of
court
identification?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say
that...
i'm
not
exactly
sure
how
much
your
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
hypothetical
eliminates.
is
it
in
any
case
where
an
identification
witness
has
previously
talked
to
a
police
officer
or
to
a
prosecuting
attorney?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fox,
in
your
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
at
what
point
did
you
assume
that
the
determination
was
made,
that
the
identification
witness
or
testimony
was
unduly
suggestive?
did
you
assume
it
was
made
by
the
trial
judge
on
a
motion
for
new
trial?
justice
rehnquist
after
the
testimony
had
gone
in?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
you're
positing
then,
is
a
situation
where,
on
a
question
by
question
basis,
which
is
the
way
cross
examinations
and
direct
examinations
take
place,
the
judge
allows
a
witness
to
testify
in
such
a
manner,
overrules
objections
to
individual
questions,
and
then
at
the
end
of
a
line
of
questioning,
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
have
sustained
them?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
have
thought
from
your
answer
to
some
of
the
other
questions
that
it
was
accorded
under
kentucky
procedure
now.
on
a
motion
to
suppress
after
being
furnished
a
list
of
witnesses,
can
the
defense
counsel
move
to
suppress
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses
on
the
grounds
that
it's
identification
testimony?
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
trial
court
have
to
hear
whatever
the
defense
counsel
has
to
say
at
that
time,
and
is
it
a
factual
determination?
justice
rehnquist
will
they
call
witnesses
at
the
hearing?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
realize
you
have
both,
but
aren't
they
generally
posited
on
different
grounds?
justice
rehnquist
it's
just
a
question
of
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
motion
for
new
trial
simply
says
that
there
was
some
procedural
unfairness
or
evidence
admitted
that
may
not
have
been
reliable,
and
the
defendant
ought
not
to
be
sentenced
on
the
basis
of
the
first
trial,
but
nonetheless,
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
rehnquist
but
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
says
there
simply
was
not
enough
evidence
to
persuade
a
reasonable
juror
to
convict,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
those
are
the
same
standards?
