mr.
victor
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
does
not
mandate
an
in
camera
determination
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
what
plaintiff,
or
petitioner,
is
asking
here
is
basically
that
because
of
wade,
and
a
series
of
identification
cases,
that
they
have
the
right,
constitutionally,
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
we
have
used
the
phrase
"reliability"
today.
reliability
is
used
to
denote
two
separate
things:
first,
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
and
second,
the
credibility
of
the
witness
in
presenting
that
evidence.
one
is
a
function
of
the
trial
court,
the
other
is
a
function
of
the
jury.
the
right
to
counsel
is
predicated
upon
an
inherent
fairness
in
our
system.
it's
to
remove
the
inequality
of
the
adversarial
proceedings.
wade,
the
man
was
unable
to
cope
with
what
the
government
was
doing
at
that
point
in
time
without
counsel.
this
damage
to
him
could
not
be
cured
later,
with
cross
examination.
the
practical
aspects
which
this
court
has
indicated
through
its
questioning
are
just
beyond
belief.
the
phrase
"nuts
and
bolts
of
justice",
i
submit
we're
going
to
have
a
lot
more
bolts
than
we
are
nuts
to
go
on
them.
the
process
of
the
brother
identification;
what
about
an
eyewitness
as
to
a
physical
object
such
as
an
automobile?
the
t.v.
camera
in
a
bank
robbery?
all
the
practical
aspects
that
we're
talking
about,
just
because
defense
counsel
would
like
to
cross
examine
and
determine
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
ask
questions
in
front
of
the
jury.
those
which
are
beneficial
to
him
he
will
ask.
those
which
i.e.,
indicate
or
incriminate,
he's
not
going
to
ask.
mr.
victor
fox
not
only
in
trial,
but
before
this
honorable
court,
i
would
certainly
appreciate
a
rehearsal
of
this
argument
before
standing
up
here.
i
think
we
all
would.
the
ability
to
hear
your
questions
and
to
know
how
to
respond
before
you
all
really
make
a
determination,
and
wait
to
sit
down
and
answer
my
questions.
the
ability
for
trial
counsel
to...
the
prosecutor
to
go
in
and
check
the
alibi
witnesses,
the...
you
know,
is
the
defendant
going
to
make
this
statement
this
time,
or
is
that
going
to
be
an
incriminating
statement,
or
if
it
is,
i'll
ask
it
at
trial,
if
it's
not
an
incriminating
statement,
if
it's
to
his
advantage,
i
won't
ask
it
as
trial
counsel.
mr.
victor
fox
well,
that
which
we're
going
after
is
the
likelihood
of
irreparable
misidentification.
mr.
victor
fox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
there
is
an
alternative
to
that.
upon
the
judge
declaring
that
evidence
inadmissible,
it
would
be
no
different
than
him
declaring
hearsay
inadmissible,
or
any
other
evidence
inadmissible.
trial
counsel,
defense
counsel,
at
that
point
in
time,
asks
for
an
admonition,
if
not
given
sua
sponte,
and
in
addition,
he
may
ask
for
a
mistrial.
admittedly,
the
prosecutor
runs
the
burden,
or
runs
the
risk
that
if
his
identification
is
inadmissible
everything
is
going
to
go
down
the
tubes
at
that
point
in
time.
but
assuming...
going
on
with
your
hypothetical,
that
the
trial
court
denies
the
motion
for
mistrial,
we
still
have
the
appellate
review
of
due
process,
the
fundamental
unfairness
aspect;
it
does
not
require
a
per
se
constitutional
requirement
that
we
determine
all
these
factors
prior
to
trial.
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor,
i
made
the
assumption
that
the
motion,
it
was
following
a
motion
by
defense
counsel
during
trial.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
and
i'm
basing
my
response
somewhat
on
kentucky,
that
you
must
object
at
the
time
evidence
is
admitted
or
you
waive
the
objection.
the
objection,
on
the
hypothetical,
the
objection
was
made
at
the
time
the
evidence
was
admitted.
the
objection
was
sustained,
because
it
was
inadmissible,
and
admonition
given,
your
honor,
admonition
was
insufficient,
moved
for
mistrial,
mistrial
overruled.
that
is
preserved
for
a
fundamental
fairness
test
on
review.
i
don't
think
it
requires
a
constitutional
mandate
to
determine
prior
out
of...
at
least
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
i
think
the
defendant
is
protected
in
this
particular
instance
and
i
think
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
is
followed.
mr.
victor
fox
it
can
go
both
ways,
your
honor.
he
could
initially
determine
that
it's
not
admissible
after
it's
come
in,
or
it
could
be
on
a
question
by
question
basis.
the
fact
situation,
and
i'd
like
to
back
up
in
this
particular
instance.
in
the
rape
case
in
summitt,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
based
on
the
fact
that
counsel
was
not
present
at
the
photographic
viewing.
in
watkins,
the
basic
objection
was
lack
of
counsel
at
the
line
up.
the
line
up
was
conducted,
it
was
a
pre
indictment
line
up.
the
basic
motions
presented
to
these
two
separate
trial
courts
was
right
to
counsel
at
the
initial
identification
procedure.
these
motions
were
presented
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
the
court
took
a
look
at
what
was
available,
in
fact,
i
believe
in
the
summitt
case,
it
was
an
off
the
record
determination,
there
were
some
comments
off
the
record.
and
the
court
said
no,
the
cases
are,
and
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
at
a
photographic...
especially
when
the
individual
had
gone
through
some
1200
photographs
and
mug
shots
before
identifying
mr.
summitt.
the
court
said
there
is
no
suggestiveness
here,
that
identification
would
be
admissible.
he
had
made
the
determination.
mr.
victor
fox
normally
there
would
be
a
motion
to
suppress,
based
on
those
grounds;
there
would
be
conduct
of
a
hearing
to
determine
that
particular
issue.
in
other
words,
there
would
be--
mr.
victor
fox
--if
there
were
sufficient...
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
victor
fox
--per
se,
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
think
the
constitutional
protection
is
available
upon
the...
a
later
determination.
mr.
victor
fox
that
could
be
a
factor.
mr.
victor
fox
that
was
watkins,
however,
watkins
was
identified
in
court
without
any
reference
to
the
pretrial.
the
victim
was...
identified,
and
there
was
no
pretrial
identification
brought
in
at
watkins,
it
was
simply
an
in
court
identification.
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor,
in
fact,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
victor
fox
normally,
in
our
jurisdiction,
a
motion
to
suppress...
there
is,
it's
made
pretrial,
and
the
courts
go
into
it.
these
are--
mr.
victor
fox
--i
said
normally
there
is
a
motion
made
pretrial
to
suppress,
and
there
is
at
least
a
hearing,
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
motion
will
be
granted
or
not.
these
particular--
mr.
victor
fox
--it
can
be,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
requirement
that
evidence
has
to
be
put
on,
on
the
facts,
as
in
these
particular
cases.
the
motion,
the
grounds
for
the
motion
was
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
them,
no
he
wasn't.
that
was
it.
there
was
no--
mr.
victor
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
you
should
be,
and
basically,
when
they
do
take
the
evidence
is
that
they
put
on...
a
police
officer
who
either
took
the
photographs
out
and
showed
them
or
conducted
the
line
up,
or
something
of
this
nature.
and
it
shows
that
the
identification
procedure
itself
was
not
suggestive.
does
not
get
into
the
person
who
actually
made
the
identification.
we're
talking
here
not--
mr.
victor
fox
--oh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact...
well,
it's
not
before
the
court,
so
i
won't
mention
a
particular
factual
situation.
needless
to
say,
in
one
instance
that
i'm
aware
of,
that
prosecutor,
defense
counsel
and
trial
judge
beforehand
said,
hey,
this
is
all
we've
got,
we'll
put
it
before
the
jury
and
if
i...
the
judge
said,
if
i
rule
admissible,
it
will
go
to
the
jury;
if
i
rule
it
inadmissible,
i'll
move
for
a
mistrial.
i'll
entertain
a
motion
for
mistrial
and
direct
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor.
the
motion
to
suppress
is
basically
a
routine
motion
filed
if
there
is
evidence
which
has
been
seized,
either
a
fourth
amendment
right
or
identification
procedure.
mr.
victor
fox
witnesses
are
available.
on
our
pretrial
discovery
motion,
scientific
evidence,
statements
of
witnesses
are
not
available
from
the
state.
witnesses
are
available,
names
are
available.
mr.
victor
fox
pretrial.
mr.
victor
fox
in
addition,
we
normally
hold
a
preliminary
hearing,
in
which
there
is
sufficient
information
put
on
normally,
as
to,
it's
used
as
a
discovery
motion.
and
basically,
that's
what
petitioners
are
asking
for
here,
is
an
extension
of
discovery.
mr.
victor
fox
he
can
move
to
suppress
for
any
grounds
that
he
wishes,
whether
it
be
identification
or
witness
identification.
it's
just
the
trial
court
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
it
will
or
will
not
be.
mr.
victor
fox
it's
the--
mr.
victor
fox
--there
can
be,
it's
not
required.
it's
as
the
commentary
to
federal
rule
104
says,
that
in
the
best
interests
of
justice.
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
the
factual
situation
presented
at
that
particular
motion,
should
we
go
into
a
hearing
or
is
it
so
obvious--
mr.
victor
fox
--both
were
denied
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
victor
fox
the
motion
was
to
suppress
because
there
was
no
attorney
present
at
the
photographic
id.
under,
clearly
under
ash,
he
was
not
entitled.
the
motion
should
have
been
denied
on
that
basis
and
on
that
basis
alone.
there
was
no
necessity
to
hold
the
hearing.
mr.
victor
fox
the
grounds--
mr.
victor
fox
--because
counsel
was
not
present
at
pretrial.
mr.
victor
fox
there
was
no
full
blown
hearing
with
evidence
taken.
mr.
victor
fox
admissibility
of
any
evidence.
i
do
not...
i
cannot
make
the
compartmentalization
that
petitioners
do
for
identification
admissibility
and
other
evidentiary
hearings.
mr.
victor
fox
no,
your
honor,
that
was
not--
mr.
victor
fox
--under
the
same
facts,
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
same
motion,
same
grounds
to
suppress.
if
they
were
to
raise
the
issue
that
has
been
raised
later,
that...
the
motion
may
be
granted.
but
again,
it's
at
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
it's
not
a
per
se
constitutional
rule
that
such
a
hearing
can
determine,
or
determine
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
i'd
like
to
point
out
basically
the
difference
in
jackson,
or
that
we
perceive
to
be
the
difference
in
jackson,
is
that
in
jackson
there
was
a
statute
which
required
the
jury
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
this
court
said
that
that
could
not
be,
the
same
jury
determined
the
voluntariness
as
well
as
the
credibility
of
it,
as...
and
the
guilt
and
innocence.
we
would
submit
that
in
this
particular
instance,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
jury
determine
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence;
the
court,
trial
court,
still
makes
that
determination,
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor,--
mr.
victor
fox
--that
is
correct.
and
if
it
should
perhaps
get
through
our
system,
and
on
a
habeas
action,
it
would
probably
not
get
past
that
stage.
mr.
victor
fox
right,
credibility
is
always
an
issue
for
the
jury.
the
credibility
issue
as
to
the
identification,
the
witness'
firmness
in
the
identification
is
for
the
jury.
and
these
are
probably
the
only
two
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
in
kentucky
in
which
there
were
no...
there
was
no
pretrial
hearing.
they
came
about
a
year
apart
and
came
out
of
the
same
jurisdiction.
mr.
victor
fox
as
defense
counsel,
i
would
move
for
a
mistrial
or,
at
the
very
least,
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
victor
fox
i
would,
unringing
bells
is
a
very
difficult
task.
mr.
victor
fox
well
let
me
answer
that
by
saying
this,
that
in
your
hypothetical
there
was
other
identification
evidence
which
pointed
to
the
defendant.
setting
aside
that
which,
in
your
hypo,
should
not
have
been
admitted,
as
though
it
had
not
been,
and
looking
at
the
remainder
of
the
case,
and
there
was
adequate
identification
evidence,
i
would
say
that
no,
there
is
not
an
entitlement
to,
constitutionally.
i,
again,
going
back
to
the
fundamental
fairness--
mr.
victor
fox
--well
that's
basically
what
i'm
saying
when
you
set
it
aside,
you
set
aside
the
error
and
taking
a
look
at
it.
mr.
victor
fox
which
we
permit.
mr.
victor
fox
we
have
both
in
kentucky,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
i
really
do
not
know,
it
depends,
i
think
personally,
upon
the
counsel.
if
he
is
moving
for
a
judgment,
or
directed
verdict
acquittal
prior
to
the
jury
verdict,
he
comes
back,
he
moves
for
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
i
think
those
are
identical,
the
motion
for
new
trial--
mr.
victor
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
still
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
victor
fox
our
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
must
be
made
before
it
is
given
to
the
jury.
at
the
close
of
all
evidence.
if
that
is
overruled
and
it
goes
to
the
jury
and
a
verdict
of
guilty
comes
back,
then
the
judgment
o.v.
can
be
made.
mr.
victor
fox
basically
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
fox
well,
we
basically
have
a
standard
that
where
it
would
clearly
not
be
unreasonable
for
the
jury
to
reach
a
verdict
of
guilty.
mr.
victor
fox
he'd
probably
deny
it
and
let
it
go
up
on
appeal.
mr.
victor
fox
he'd
probably
still
let
it
go
up
on
appeal,
and
let
the
appellate
court,
since
we
have
elected
judges,
would
let
the
appellate
court
direct
that
a
new
trial
be
granted.
mr.
victor
fox
yes,
i
think
in
fact
we're
talking
two
separate
constitutional
rights,
and
one
is
the
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
incriminate
oneself;
and
the
other
is
the
right
to
counsel,
and
the...
you
know,
in
pinto,
it
said
it's
prudent
to
hold
the
hearings.
and
i
can't
but
be
perfectly
candid
with
this
court
and
say
it
would
have
been
far
more
prudent
in
both
of
these
instances,
simply
because
if
they
had
held
the
hearing
we
would
not
be
here
today.
but
that
still
does
not
take
away
the
fact
that
there
was
no
denial
of
due
process
in
these
particular
cases.
you
look
at
the
evidence,
the
1200
photographs
in
the
rape
case,
the
identification
to
the
police
beforehand,
the
descriptions.
it's
simply
and
basically
a
commonsense
approach
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
do
you
hold
separate
trials,
at
what
point
do
we
draw
the
line?
i
can
draw
the
line
between
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
and
the
admissibility
of
identification
evidence.
i
have
difficulty
in
viewing
the
difference
between
an
eyewitness
of
a
person
and
an
eyewitness
as
to
the
color
of
an
automobile
involved
in
an
automobile
accident.
mr.
victor
fox
identification
evidence.
mr.
victor
fox
the
standard
is
basically
that
which
is
the
fundamental
unfairness.
it's
the
right
to,
you
know,
prevent
inequality
in
the
adversarial
proceedings.
we're
pointing
out
that
there
is
no
inequality
in
this
adversarial
