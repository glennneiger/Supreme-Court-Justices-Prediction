this
is
as
to
the
admissibility
of
any
identification
evidence?
justice
stewart
or
a
proposed
identification
in
court?
justice
stewart
the
first
three
cases
you
mentioned
had
to
do
with;
the
first
two
with
a
line
up
and
the
third
one
with
a
show
up,
so
called?
justice
stewart
and
the
second
cases,
category
of
cases
you
mentioned,
had
to
do
with
identification
in
court?
justice
stewart
the
question
in
biggers,
as
i
remember
it,
i
haven't
read
it
recently,
was
how
much
of
an
opportunity
did
the
victim
of
the
rape
in
that
case
have
to,
actually
have
to
identify
the
defendant,
isn't
that
it?
justice
stewart
in
court?
justice
stewart
there
was
not
a
line
up
in
biggers,
was
there?
justice
stewart
i
didn't
hear
you.
justice
stewart
which
is
basically
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
stewart
and
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
would
basically
be
some
error
that
occurred
during
the
trial,
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
ultimate
innocence
or
guilt,
or
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
these
cases
are
here
by
a
reason
of
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
these
cases
were
consolidated
for
argument
and
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
as
in
this
court.
they
present
the
question
whether
a
state
criminal
trial
court
is
constitutionally
compelled
to
conduct
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
whenever
a
defendant
contends
that
a
witness'
identification
of
him
was
arrived
at
improperly.
for
the
reasons
elaborated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
a
per
se
rule
compelling
such
a
procedure
in
every
case
and
accordingly
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
affirmed.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
has
been
joined
by
justice
marshall.
