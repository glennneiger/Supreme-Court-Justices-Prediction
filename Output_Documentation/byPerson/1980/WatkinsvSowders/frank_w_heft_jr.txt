mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
brought
before
the
court
today
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
or
not
constitutional
due
process
of
law
requires
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
determine
the
admissibility
of...
identification
evidence.
we
submit
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
narrow
one
concerning
the
admission
of
identification
evidence,
but
rather
the
issue,
and
the
essence
of
that
issue
goes
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
court
must
examine
the
practical
application
of
the
issue
because
it
has
a
direct
effect
on
the
practice
of
criminal
law
in
cases
throughout
this
country.
the
petitioners
will
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the
necessity
for
requiring
an
in
camera
hearing
is
so
intricately
interwoven
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
due
process
requires
an
in
camera
hearing.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
be
it
a
show
up,
line
up,
or--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--exactly.
we
feel
that,
this
court
has
examined
in
its
history,
numerous
cases
involving
identification
testimony.
those
cases,
to
wit,
wade,
stovall
and
gilbert,
were
concerned
with
the
suggestive
identification
procedures
that
may
be
implemented.
the
more
recent
decisions,
specifically
the
biggers
and
the
manson
decisions,
deal
with
the
reliability
of
the
identification
evidence.
the
emphasis
has,
in
fact,
shifted.
the
present
stand
of
the
manson
standard,
which
requires
that
the
reliability
of
identification
evidence
be
weighed
against
the
corrupting
effect
of
suggestive
identification
procedures,
requires
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
how
that
procedure
is
going
to
be
implemented.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well
biggers,
when
the...
i
believe
when
the
test
shifted
to
biggers,
there
was
a
show
up
conducted
in
the
biggers
case
and
the
court
determined,
rather
than
to
rely
only
on
the...
the
only
test
was
that
various
factors
had
to
be
determined--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--exactly.
the
court
recognized
that
a
show
up
is
a
suggestive
procedure,
per
se.
but
the
real
question
in
the
biggers
case
was,
could
the
witness,
notwithstanding
any
suggestive
identification
procedures,
could
the
witness
give
an
accurate
and
reliable
identification.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
just
the
show
up.
the
question
becomes
how
does
due
process
require
the
manson
analysis
to
be
implemented.
and
we
submit
there
are
several
considerations
along
this
line.
first
of
all,
as
the
respondent
argues
here,
that
discovery
is
an
adequate
method
by
which
to
implement
the
manson
analysis.
we
submit
that
discovery
is
totally
inadequate;
primarily
because
the
purpose
of
discovery
is
only
to
disclose
what
possible
evidence
may
exist.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
resolution
of
issues
of
constitutional
magnitude.
more
importantly
there
is
no
due
process
right
to
discovery.
discovery
is
necessarily
a
matter
of
state
procedural
law.
consequently,
it's...
what
is
discoverable
today
may
not
be
discoverable
tomorrow.
in
fact,
kentucky
at
the
present
time
is
going
through
a
revision
of
its
discovery
rules.
and
we
feel
for
those
reasons
discovery
is
constitutionally
inadequate
to
achieve
a
reliable
identification.
the
respondent
also
argues
that
the
defense
attorney
has
equal
access
to
pretrial
interviews
of
witnesses
and
that
this
will
satisfy
any
constitutional
requirements--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
think
anyone
ever
questioned
the
individual's
right
to
counsel.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
individual
is
entitled
to
counsel
in
pre
critical
stages;
that's
not
the
issue.
we
assume,
for
example
in
watkins'
case,
watkins
was
identified
in
a
line
up
and
a
show
up
before
his
indictment.
we're
not
saying
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
at
those
points
in
time,
all
we're
saying
in
this
brief,
is
that
counsel
did
have
the
right
to
an
in
camera
hearing
to
challenge
the
reliability--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--in
watkins'
case,
there
was
a
pretrial
motion
filed
to
suppress.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
pretrial.
the
judge
called
the
case
for
trial,
both
attorneys
asked
for
in
camera
hearings.
both
attorneys
in
the
watkins
and
the
summitt
cases
cited
wade,
stovall
and
gilbert
and
constitutional
principles,
to
justify
the
request
for
the
hearings.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no.
no
one
cited
jackson
v.
denno.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
it
was
raised
and
it
was
considered
by,
particularly,
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
the
state
courts
did
not
specifically
address
the
jackson
issue.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
it
had
been...
jackson
had
not
been,
specifically
raised.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well
the
kentucky
supreme
court
just
found,
in
both
of
these
cases,
that
there
was
no
due
process
right.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
to
have
the
in
camera
hearing
before
eye
witness
identification
could
be
admitted.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that
specific
issue
was
raised.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
due
process.
because
the
attorney
on
cross
examination
cannot
adequately
challenge
the
reliability
of
identification.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well
justice
white,
it
had
not
been
raised
specifically
in
jackson
v.
denno
terms
in
the
state
court.
it
had
been
raised--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes,
it
was
claimed--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes
sir,
it
was.
due
process
grounds--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
has
certain
ramifications
for
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
that's
our
position.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
the
issue
to
be
determined
and
that's
the
value
of
the
in
camera
hearing.
we
don't
feel
that
an
attorney
on
cross
examination
can
adequately
challenge
the
reliability
of
identification.
there
are
too
many
factors
the
attorney
has
to
consider
when
he
undertakes
cross
examination.
he's
got
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
case.
i
think
this
court
has
to
analyze
the
issue
presented
here
from
the
perspective
of
the
trial
attorney.
when
the
trial
attorney
is
going
to
cross
examine
a
witness,
for
example,
in
the
summitt
case,
he's
going
to
cross
examine
a
rape
victim
who
is
still
emotionally
distraught
because
of
this
experience
over
almost
two
years
after
the
rape
itself.
he
also
has
to
take
into
consideration
what
did
the
prosecutor
achieve
on
direct
examination.
the
watkins
case
is
a
classic
example.
the
prosecution
didn't
even
touch
the
pretrial
identification--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
true.
his...
what
we're
saying
is
that,
without
this
in
camera
hearing,
the
attorney
is
just
in
an
incredibly
untenable
position
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
the
identification.
we
would
submit
that,
granted
it
would
take
time
to
conduct
the
evidentiary
hearing,
pretrial,
or
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
but
we
would
submit
that
it
is
judicial
economy
to
conduct
that
hearing,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
attorney
is
going
to...
if,
assuming
the
reliability
is
very
strong,
an
in
camera
hearing
may
result
in
settlement
of
the
case.
second
of
all,
if
the
reliability
is
so
strong,
the
attorney,
he
may
waive
cross
examination
of
that
witness
and
certainly,
he's
going
to
restrict
and
limit
his
cross
examination.
he's
not
going
to
engage
in
the
rambling
type
of
cross
examination
that
summitt's
attorney
engaged
in.
summitt--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it
adds
up
to
a
question
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
this
particular
issue
is
restricted
only
to
identification
evidence
cases.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well,
you
would
not...
i
think,
primarily,
the
constitutional
ramifications
of
suggestive
identification
procedures
and
unreliability
of
identification
evidence.
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
rehnquist,
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
a
certain
substance
may
be
cocaine
or
heroin,
that...
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
problems
with
a
denial
of
an
in
camera
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
substance
is
in
fact
a
controlled
substance.
but
here
there
are
just
far
reaching
constitutional
ramifications
that
require
the
hearing.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
exactly.
but
i
would--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
that's
a
matter,
justice
marshall,
of
state
procedural
law.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
you
have
to
have
a
rerun
of
your
evidence,
but
the
constitution
says--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
don't
know
if
it's
so
much...
there's
nothing--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
the
sixth
amendment
requires
the
hearing.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
the
constitution
requires
the
government
to
do
it.
it
doesn't
require
what
the
defense
attorney
wants
it
to--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
it's
the
nature
of
the
evidence.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
this--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
one's
a
rape
case
and
one's
a
robbery
case.
but
they--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
it's
only
restricted
to
cases
in
which
identification
evidence
is
going
to
be
introduced.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
follow
the
analogy.
i
don't--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--well,--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it's...
no,
because
i
think
there's
a
conflict--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
would
submit
that
a
determination
of
whether
a
confession
can
be
admitted
into
evidence,
as
evidenced
in
jackson
v.
denno.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that
was
raised,
the
courts
did
consider
that.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
the
sixth
circuit.
it
explained
the--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--the
state
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
due
process
violation,
for
failing
to
conduct
the
hearing.
the
sixth
circuit
reached
the
same
conclusion,
but
based
on
jackson
in
the
pinto
decision.
and
we
submit
that's
an
erroneous
conclusion.
because
the
analysis
in
jackson
went
right
to
the
practical
effect
of
allowing...
what
happens
when
the
jury
is
allowed
to
determine
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
and
pass
on
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence?
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
they
have
to
determine
the
reliability
of
the
evidence,
and
the
reliability
is
based
first
of
all,
on,
perhaps,
suggestive
identification
procedures.
that's...
has
to
be,
whether
or
not
the
identification
procedure
is
suggestive
has
to
be
determined.
we
submit
that
that's
a
question
of
law,
given
the
decisions
of
this
court
along
these
lines.
after
the
court
decides
whether
or
not
the
identification
is
suggestive,
the
court
then
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
spite
of
any
suggestive
procedures,
is
the
identification
reliable
and
can
the
jury
itself
pass
on
the
credibility
of
the
witness
and
the
reliability
of
that
identification.
the
problem
i
see,
that
this
court
should
take
into
account,
is
if
we
don't
have
the
in
camera
hearing,
what
happens
when
the
jury
is
confronted
with
the
foster
v.
california
situation?
in
which
the
identification
procedures
are
obviously
suggestive,
the
identification
of
the
witness
is
obviously
unreliable.
what's
the
jury
going
to
do
in
that
situation?
is
the
jury,
from
the
standpoint
of
human
nature,
going
to
be
able
to
follow
the
trial
judge's
admonition
to
ignore
any
evidence
concerning
identification--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
true.
but
we
think
that
the
jackson
v.
denno
case
can
be
analogized
very
clearly
to
this
case,
for
the
reasons
we've
set
forth.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
analogy
that
keeps
coming
to
mind
is
the
foster
v.
california
situation,
where
the
defendant
was
put
in
a
line
up
with
seven
individuals,
who
bore
no
resemblance
to
him;
right
after
the
line
up,
the
prosecuting
witness
said
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
man.
foster
was
then
brought,
on
a
one
on
one
confrontation,
to
confront
the
man.
the
witness
said
i'm
still
not
sure.
a
line
up
was
held
sometime
later,
a
week
or
so
later,--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
only
suggesting
to
the
court
that
where
you
may
have
to
exclude
evidence
is
where
there
may
be
any
indication
of
suggestive
identification
procedures.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no,
we
don't
subscribe
to
that
position
at
all.
for
example,
if
an
individual
observed
the
defendant
coming
out
of
a
house,
the
defendant
was
charged
with...
carrying
a
t.v....
the
defendant
was
charged
with
burglary,
we
would
submit
that
we
would
not
be
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
those
set
of
circumstances.
there
are
no
suggestive
identification
procedures.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
our
argument
applies
only
to
those
situations
in
which
the
police,
or
any
government
authorities,
have
conducted
identification
procedures.
that
in
order
to
determine
the...
whether
or
not
those
procedures
were
suggestive,
due
process
requires
the
hearing;
only
in
those
instances.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
don't
necessarily
think,
your
honor,
if
there
has
been
no
indication
that
the
state
has
not
engaged
in
suggestive
identification
procedures.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
in
each
and
every
case
in
which
you
have
identification
evidence
that
you're
required
to
have
a
due
process
hearing.
only
in
those
cases
where
the
state
has
implemented
identification
procedures.
because
of
the
suggestive
natures
of
those
procedures.
the
court
has
recognized
the
problem
posed
by
identification
procedures.
we
submit
that
when
those
circumstances
arise,
then
we
are
entitled
to
the
due
process--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
i
would.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
such
as
presented
here
with
these
two
cases.
i
don't
think
every
witness
in
every
case
has
to
xx
only
in
those
instances
where
the
state
has
implemented
identification
procedures;
the
determination
has
to
be
made
whether
those
state
sanctioned
procedures
are
suggestive,
and
then
reliability
is
determined--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--assuming
that
there
has
been
no
other--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
that's
our
position.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
think
as
soon
as...
i
think
the
right
attaches
as
soon
as
the
police
or
the
government
authority
conducts
an
identification
procedure--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--as
long
as,
just
before
the
identification
evidence
is
admitted,
whether
it
is
before
trial
or
after
the
commencement
of
trial,
we
would
suggest
that
it
be
done
before
trial.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no
sir.
if
in
the
course
of
the
prosecuting
attorney's
examination,
if
he
goes
to
that
witness
and
says
tell
me
what
you
saw
and
the
witness
says
i
saw
that
man
rob
the
bank
or
i
saw
that
man
come
out
of
that
house
with
a
t.v.,
i
don't
think
the
due
process
right
would
necessarily
attach
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
the
identification
testimony.
i
think
cross
examination
would
be
adequate
in
those
instances.
but
where
the
identification
has
been
made,
the
state
has
implemented
the
line
up
procedures
or
any
type
of
identification
procedures,
that's
where
the
due
process
right
attaches.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
perhaps
i've
not
made
myself
clear,
justice
white.
i
don't--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
it...
in
the
situation
that
justice
brennan
gave,
you're
always
entitled.
you
are
entitled
to
the
due
process
hearing.
only
when
the
state
has
implemented--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--yes.
but
whether
or
not
the
state
has
undertaken
any
procedures
which
may
have
suggested
or
may
have
impaired
the
reliability
of
the
identification,
that's
the
issue
to
be
determined.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
not...
no,
not
necessarily.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
think
in
justice
brennan's
hypothetical,
there's
no...
there
are
no
identification
procedures
at
all.
the
identification
does
not
have
to
be
made
from
a
photograph--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--certainly,
the
next
door
neighbor--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--no,
it
does
not...
no.
i
think
cross
examination--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--our
only
position
is
that--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--i
think
cross
examination
in
that
particular
respect--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--the
problem--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--it's
very
limited
in
its
nature.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
that's
all...
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no
sir.
but
that's--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
well
most,
a
number
of
states
follow
kentucky's
approach,
in
which
the
kentucky
supreme
court
said
in
both
of
these
cases,
this
in
camera
hearing
was
a
preferred
course
of
action.
there
are
also
numerous
jurisdictions
that
mandatorily
require
this
hearing.
and
we
submit
that
when
so
many
jurisdictions
recognize
the
benefits
of
such
a
hearing,
that
there
is
a
due
process
right
to
be
derived
therefrom.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
i
would
disagree,
respectfully,
justice
marshall.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
the
third
circuit,
i
believe,
couched
the
issue
in
terms
of
the
jackson
v.
denno
situation,
and
said
that
you
are
entitled
to
the
hearing
if
you
can
show
that
your
claim
of
suggestiveness
is
not
frivolous.
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
no.
because
we--
mr.
frank
w.
heft,
jr.
--as
a
practical
point,
from
a
practical
aspect,
we
would...
we
don't
agree
with
the
application
in
the
driber
case.
we
would
submit
that
if
you're
going
to
have
the
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
your
motion
is
frivolous,
the
evidence
is
going
to
come
out
anyway.
and
due
process
would
require
the
hearing
just
on
motion
alone.
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
few
concluding
remarks.
the
issue,
in
recent
years,
the
defense
bar
has
come
under
criticism
in
examination
from
courts,
judges,
commentators
and
lawyers,
alike,
concerning
the
effectiveness
of
their
representation
at
the
trial
level.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
decision
that
this
court
is
going
to
reach
today
on
these
two
cases
is
going
to
touch
specifically
that
issue;
that's
the
long
range
effect
of
this
case.
we
would
submit
that
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
sixth
circuit
which
recognized
the
dangers
of
blind
cross
examination,
which
recognized
the
untenable
position
of
defense
attorneys
when
they
are
denied
the
in
camera
hearing,
would
echo
the
sentiments
of
every
defense
attorney
in
the
country.
the
issue
here
is
not
necessarily
an
academic
one
which
is
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
constitutional
issues;
it's
more
a
practical
determination
that
this
court
is
going
to
make.
this
court
is
going
to
make
a
decision
today
that's
going
to
affect
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
the
practice
of
law
in
every
criminal
case
in
the
united
states.
and
we
would
submit
that
with
that
in
mind,
due
process
requires
the
hearing.
thank
you.
