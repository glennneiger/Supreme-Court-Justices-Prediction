justice
marshall
would
you
also
give
the
state
the
right
to
examine
alibi
witnesses
ahead
of
time?
justice
marshall
well
why
isn't
this
also
a
matter...
what
part
of
the
constitution
says
you
have
to
have
a
rerun
of
your
evidence?
justice
marshall
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
the
government
has
to
help
you
in
your
case?
justice
marshall
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
the
government
should
do
what
you
should
do
yourself
as
defense
counsel?
justice
marshall
that
the
government
should
do
what
you
ought
to
do
yourself?
justice
marshall
well
what
in
the
constitution
says
that
you
should
have
the
right
to
examine
one
class
of
witnesses
before
they
are
put
on
the
stand?
justice
marshall
oh,
it's
the
nature
of
the
evidence.
justice
marshall
in
any
kind
of
case?
justice
marshall
what
kind
of
a
case,
a
rape
case?
justice
marshall
well,
is
it
restricted
to
those?
justice
marshall
suppose
it's
an
sec
case
for
identification?
justice
marshall
neither
do
i,
i
don't
follow
where
you
are
either.
see,
that's
my
trouble.
i
just
don't
understand
why
this
is
singled
out,
except
that
this
is
the
case
that
you
have--
justice
marshall
--that's
the
only
reason
it's
singled
out,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
well
you
name
me
one
other
field
it
would
apply
to?
justice
marshall
but
you
didn't
raise
jackson
v.
denno.
justice
marshall
which
court?
justice
marshall
i'm
talking
about
the
state
court;
that's
where
it
started.
justice
marshall
--mr.
heft,
suppose
the
policeman
just
goes
out
and
picks
up
a
man
at
random
and
charges
him?
you
would
not
have
a
right
to
go
into
that,
would
you?
i'm
assuming
they
picked
up
the
wrong
man.
you
wouldn't
have
a
right
then
to
have
the
hearing,
would
you?
would
you?
justice
marshall
does
that
cut
you
any
way
at
all?
justice
marshall
that
man
is
rather
innocent.
justice
marshall
well
what
would
you
get,
on
your
theory
that
you
wouldn't
get
on
cross
examination?
justice
marshall
it's
really
getting
cross
examination
ahead
of
time,
that's
all
you're
getting.
justice
marshall
that's
all
you're
getting,
cross
examination
ahead
of
time?
justice
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
defense
lawyer
that
wouldn't
like
to
do
that?
justice
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
government
lawyer
that
wouldn't
like
to
do
that?
justice
marshall
but
most
of
the
cases
don't
rely
on
due
process,
though.
justice
marshall
well,
the
third,
ninth,
and
the
tc
don't.
justice
marshall
such
as
the
fact
that
the
witness
said
that
the
man
looked
like
he
was
around
30;
and
the
man
was
actually
17?
justice
marshall
well
that
was
watkins.
justice
marshall
i
guess
you
have
to
come
prepared
to
put
on
evidence,
if
you
have
to?
justice
marshall
should
you
be?
