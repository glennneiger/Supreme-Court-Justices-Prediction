justice
white
you
mean
that
when
the
in
court
identification
was
offered
by
the
prosecution,
did
you
then
at
that
time
ask
for
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
now,
you
objected
at
the...
in
trial,
did
you?
justice
white
and
did
you
ask
at
the
time
when
the
trial
was
going
on
for
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
white
you
still
haven't
answered
justice
rehnquist's--
--did
they
cite
jackson
against
denno,
or--
justice
white
well
why
did
the
federal
habeas
court
think
that
you
had
exhausted
your
state
remedies
on
this
particular
question?
justice
white
to
what,
to
what?
justice
white
well,
so
you
did
raise
it
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
yes,
but
was
it...
on
the
grounds
of
what?
why
did
you
think
you
were
entitled
to
an
in
camera
hearing?
justice
white
well
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
if
you
had
presented
that
issue
in
the
state
courts?
justice
white
well
i
don't
care
whether
you...
it
isn't
so
much
whether
you
cited
jackson
against
denno,
but
it's
whether
or
not
you
claimed
that
the
federal
constitution
as
a
matter
of
due
process--
justice
white
--requires
you
to...
requires
an
in
camera
hearing.
justice
white
you've
now
embellished
it
with
this,
it's
really
a
right
to
counsel,
due
process
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well
the
evidence
was
admitted,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
you
don't
challenge
that
it
wasn't
admissible?
or
do
you
say
that
if
counsel
had
the
unrestrained
right
to
cross
examination,
it
might
not
have
been?
justice
white
yes,
but
the
jury
is
not
permitted
to
pass
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
justice
white
and
of
identification
of
it.
justice
white
you
mean,
when
it's...
after
the
hearing
before
the
jury
the
evidence
is
excluded
by
the
judge,
he
says
it
is
unreliable?
justice
white
and
then
you
say
that
the
jury
would
have
a
very
tough
time
of
putting
that
aside?
justice
white
that's
quite
a
different
case
from
the
one
you're...
where
the
evidence
was
admitted,
the
judge
says
that
it's
reliable,
it's
admissible,
and
your
only
argument
is
that
you
didn't
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
show
that
it
was
unreliable
because
of
the
limited
cross
examination
you
claim?
justice
white
that's
a
much
different
case
from
saying
that
the
evidence
is
excluded
and
arguing
that
instructions
to
disregard
the
evidence
is
ineffective.
that
was
really
the
bottom
line
in
jackson
against
denno,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
well,
in
watkins,
the...
all
the
prosecution
relied
on,
as
i
understand
it,
was
the
in
court
identification?
justice
white
and
then,
on
cross
examination,
the
defense
brought
out
pretrial
matters.
justice
white
and
you
say,
even
in
that
case,
there
must
be
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
white
well,
how
do
you
know
until,
if
the
prosecution
puts
on
its
witness
and
finishes...
shouldn't
you
get
up
and...
when
does
your
right
attach?
justice
white
you
mean,
before
court,
before
trial?
justice
white
well
there
will
always
be...
won't
there
always
be
a
pretrial
identification
of
some
kind?
justice
white
well
i
would...
suppose
you
would
say,
then,
anytime
the
prosecution
has
had
the
victim
or
some
witness
identify
the
defendant
before
trial,
you
have
this
due
process
right;
well
that
would
be
always.
justice
white
well,
you
haven't.
justice
white
well
won't
there
always
be
a
pretrial
identification
of
some
kind?
justice
white
well
it
will
either...
how
do
you
ever
identify
anybody
before
trial?
by
photographs,
by
show
up
or
by
a
line
up.
justice
white
or
by
somebody
saying
well,
yes,
i
know
that
person
because
it
was
my
brother.
justice
white
because
you
know,
because
if
some
neighbor,
some
neighbor
says
i
saw
him,
and
i
know
my
neighbor
very
well--
justice
white
so
you
say
that,
would
you
say
that
driber
in
the
third
circuit,
represents
your
position?
justice
white
that's
what
the
third
circuit
held,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
well
here
it
was
denied.
justice
white
there
was
a
motion
and
they
said
no
hearing.
justice
white
well
was
there
a
motion
to
suppress
any
in
court
identification;
i
thought
there
was?
justice
white
on
the...
because
the
pretrial
identification
was--
justice
white
--well
anyway,
he
made
the
motion
and
it
was
denied?
and
no
hearing
was
granted--
justice
white
--yes,
well,
he
was...
but
he
claims
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
admissibility
outside
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
white
so
you
say
however
broad
the
right
to
a
pretrial
hearing
is,
it
doesn't
cover
this
case?
justice
white
under
kentucky
practice,
you
would
say
if
this
very
same
case
came
up
again
tomorrow,
the
request
for
a
pretrial
hearing
would
be
denied?
justice
white
mr.
fox,
suppose
in
these
cases,
the...
let's
say
in
the
watkins'
case,
the
prosecution
witness
is
about
to
testify
and
identify,
making
an
in
court
identification
and
the
defense
objects
and
says
this
is
a
tainted
identification,
i'd
like
a
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury;
denied.
then
on
cross
examination...
and
the
in
court
identification
is
admitted,
with
no
reference
to
the...
any
out
of
court
identification...
on
cross
examination,
the
out
of
court
identification
is
brought
out,
and
then
the...
the
witness
is
cross
examined
and
then
the
defense
asks
the
court
to
exclude
the
in
court
identification
on
the
ground
that
it
was
tainted,
or
impermissive...
unreliable.
and
the
judge
agrees
and
strikes
the
testimony
and
instructs
the
jury
to
disregard
it.
justice
white
but
let's
assume
there's
other
identification,
going
to
be
other
identification
testimony.
but
would
you
say
that
that
is,
that
constitutionally
the
defendant
then
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
just
because
the
jury...
you
could
never
rely
on
the
jury
to
put
aside
the
evidence
that
it
heard?
justice
white
well
that
was
part
of
jackson
against
denno.
do
you
think
the
same
risk
inheres
in
this
case?
justice
white
you
don't
think
that
kind
of
a
case
would
come
down
to
harmless
error?
