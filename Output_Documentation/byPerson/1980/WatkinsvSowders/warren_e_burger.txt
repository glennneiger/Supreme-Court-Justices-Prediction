chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
watkins
against
bordenkircher
and
summitt
against
bordenkircher.
mr.
heft,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
what
you're
saying
is
that
cross
examination
is
not
sufficient?
chief
justice
burger
the
rule
you're
advocating
would
apply,
i
take
it
to,
as
equally,
to
six
witnesses,
identification
witnesses
or
12,
as
it
does
to
one,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
so
you're
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
constitution
requires
that
there
be
this
in
camera
or
pretrial
exploration
so
that
the
attorney
can
decide
whether
he
wants
to
cross
examine
and
if
so,
how
much;
isn't
that
what
it
adds
up
to?
chief
justice
burger
no,
just
answer
my
question.
isn't
that
what
you're
asking
for?
chief
justice
burger
now,
if
it's
a
hold
up
of
a
bank,
or
a
supermarket,
and
you've
got
12
witnesses,
eyewitnesses,
you're
going
to,
on
your
theory,
have
to
have
the
in
camera
examination
of
each
one
of
those
witnesses
to
see
how
fallible
or
how
strong
their
identification
may
be?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
suggest
that
ever,
under
any
circumstances,
that
the
witness
who
is
tendered
as
an
identification
witness
could
be
excluded?
chief
justice
burger
under
what
circumstances
and
for
what
reasons?
chief
justice
burger
and
excluding
line
up
now,
no
line
up
at
all.
chief
justice
burger
the
case
is
called
for
trial
and
john
jones'
name
is
listed
as
a
prosecution
witness.
he
takes
the
stand
and
begins
to
testify
and
says
yes,
i
was
in
the
bank,
i
saw
the
robbery,
and
this
is
the
man.
can
you
exclude
that
on
any
basis
whatever?
chief
justice
burger
well
if
i
understood
your
argument
that
you've
been
making,
it
is
that
you
are
entitled,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
to
have
some
private
sort
of
examination
of
that
witness
to
see
how
strong
or
how
weak
his
basis
may
be
for
the
identification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
both
the
prosecution
and
defense
if
there
could
be
a
complete
dress
rehearsal
and
make
believe
trial
in
advance
with
cross
examination
of
every
witness
and
direct
examination,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
kentucky
practice,
there
is
always
a
pretrial
motion
available
to
suppress
either
identification
or
other
evidence?
chief
justice
burger
does
your
practice
require
giving
a
list
of
witnesses
to
the
defense
in
advance
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean,
that's--
chief
justice
burger
--pretrial.
so
the
defendant
knows.
chief
justice
burger
and
if
the
trial
court
is
wrong,
the
reviewing
court
can
reverse
and
order
a
new
trial
on
that
ground?
chief
justice
burger
under
kentucky
practice,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
burger
and
basically
i
take
it
your,
or
the
state's
case,
is
that
it
is
the
function
of
cross
examination
to
expose
the
flaws
in
any
testimony,
or
flaws
in
the
credibility
of
any
witness?
chief
justice
burger
is
this
not
a
matter
of
discretion,
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
if
he
thinks
the
testimony
is
very
damaging
and
that
he
can't
unring
the
bell,
as
you
put
it,
then
you
either
grant
a
mistrial,
grant
a
new
trial,
or
after
verdict
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict?
chief
justice
burger
so
there
are
a
whole
range
of
remedies
to
deal
with
this
that
have
always
been
available?
why
would
you
grant
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
simply
because
of
trial
error?
wouldn't
you
grant
a
motion
for
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judge's
motion,
if
the
judge
decided
at
the
end
of
the
case,
after
the
verdict,
to
enter
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
he
would
do
that
only
if
he
decided
that,
excluding
the
challenged
evidence
as
to
which
he
had
instructed
the
jury
to
disregard,
there
was
no
evidence
upon
which
a
reasonable
jury
could
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
that
would
be
the
process
of
the
judge's
thinking,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
but
if
he
was
in
doubt
on--
chief
justice
burger
--or
order
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
watkins
against
sowders
and
summitt
against
sowders
will
be
announced
by
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
