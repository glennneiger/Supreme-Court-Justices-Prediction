ms.
mary
r.
carden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
cases
arises
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
full
faith
and
credit
should
be
applied
to
custody
decrees
in
the
abstract
but
rather
whether
a
decree
which
meets
all
requirements
for
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
was
properly
denied
such
full
faith
and
credit
simply
because
of
its
nature
as
a
custody
decree.
although
this--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
pardon?
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
time
the
federal
question
was
raised
was
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
trial
court
in
berrien
county,
georgia.
we
specifically
requested
that
the
court
afford
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
final
florida
judgment
rendered
just
days
before.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
we
did
not
cite
the
federal
constitution
although
we
felt
and
we
continue
to
feel
that
full
faith
and
credit
is
such
a
clear
issue,
there
is
no
reference
to
it
in
the
georgia
constitution
or
any
other
statute,
and
since
it
was
implicit
that
we
were
referring
to
the
u.
s.
constitution,
that
that
was
not
necessary.
and
it
was
clear,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
finding
of
the
georgia
supreme
court,
and
of
course
we
did
raise
it
in
our
enumerations
of
error
on
appeal.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
they
didn't
say
a
word
about
full
faith
and
credit
although
they
held
that
the
florida
decree
was
a
final
decree
and
then
continued
on
to
say,
nevertheless,
it
had
no
effect
in
preempting
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
courts.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
that
completely
disposes
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue
since
they
ignored
the--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--yes,
we
raised
it
in
our
enumerations
of
error
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
we
requested
that
the
trial
court
be
found
in
error
for
failing
to
accord
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
decree.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
there
are
some
very
specific
rules
to
which
i
think
the
respondent
was
referring
to
that
do
deal
with
the
raising
of
constitutional
issues
and
the
attack
under
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
of
course,
that
wasn't
the
case
here.
and
there
are
general
rules
that
do
say
that
you
must
argue
your
issues
in
your
brief.
we
felt
that
the
entire
brief
was
based
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
issues,
and
although
there
were
various
state
issues
involved
that
the
whole
tenor
of
the
brief
was
obviously
a
full
faith
and
credit
issue
brief.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
not
the
briefs,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe.
i
believe
the
appendix,
it
contains
everything
but
the
briefs.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
below,
your
honor,
we
argued
that...
and
i
will
get
to
this
in
more
detail...
that
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
which
was
applicable
in
both
florida
and
georgia,
also
prohibited
the
georgia
court
from
assuming
jurisdiction,
but
that
was
an
independent
ground
from
full
faith
and
credit,
because
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
is
only--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--no,
we
didn't,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
we
argued
that
on
the
basis
of
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
but
also
on
the
basis
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
that
the
trial
court
was
in
error.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
felt
that
unlike
due
process
and
some
other
more
nebulous
terms
that
may
be
found
in
numerous
statutes
and
the
state
constitution,
there
was
no
question
as
to
our
reference
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
provisions
as
being
the
united
states
constitution.
there
is
no
other
reference
in
georgia
law
to
full
faith
and
credit.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
fairly
straightforward.
mr.
and
mrs.
webb
were
divorced
in
the
superior
court
of
berrien
county,
georgia,
in
september,
1977.
in
november,
1977,
the
petitioner,
mrs.
webb,
who
was
awarded
custody
of
the
minor
child,
moved
to
the
state
of
florida
with
the
minor
child
and
became
a
resident
there.
some
15
months
later,
in
february
of
1979,
she
took
a
two-day
vacation
to
miami
leaving
the
minor
child,
according
to
her
testimony,
in
the
care
of
her
next
door
neighbor,
who
was
also
her
cousin.
during
that
two-day
absence
the
respondent
came
to
the
state
of
florida
and
removed
the
minor
child
from
the
state
of
florida.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
your
honor.
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
in
the
trial
court
in
georgia,
and
the
testimony
there
was
restricted
to
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent.
the
petitioner
alleges
that
he
went
to
the
state
of
florida
because
of
an
emergency
situation
that
existed
there.
his
own
testimony
indicates,
though,
that
when
he
did
get
to
the
state
of
florida
he
found
the
child
with
the
next
door
neighbor
who
was
the
petitioner's
cousin.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
your
honor,
we
are
totally
uncertain
because
the
only
indication
that
we
have
that
there
was
any
problem
at
all
was
that
of
the
respondent's
testimony
in
the
trial
court
of
berrien
county.
no
authorities
were
present
to
testify
to
corroborate
his
testimony.
that
was
really
the
first
indication
we
had
that
there
had
been,
if
there
was,
any
real
problem
there.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
your
honor,
in
november
of
1980
the
respondent
contacted
the
petitioner
to
pick
up
the
minor
child
and
the
petitioner
had
had
the
minor
child
in
florida,
although
the
respondent...
pardon?
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
the
respondent
has
specifically
refused
to
agree
to
any
kind
of
permanent
custody
disposition
or
modification.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that's
correct,
but
he
still--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--he
has
refused
to
agree
to
any
modification
of
custody
or
to
give
any
written
agreement
which
would
give
any
kind
of
permanence
to
this
relationship.
of
course,
that
he
still
has
legal
custody
and
would
be
able
to
make
his
claim
on
the
child
at
any
time.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
any
personal--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--that's
correct.
our
sole
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
particular
judgment
of
the
florida
court
was
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
after
finding
that
the
respondent
had
removed
the
minor
child,
the
mother
contacted
local
counsel
and
filed
an
action
in
the
state
of
florida
seeking
the
return
of
the
minor
child,
and
also
seeking
a
restraining
order.
the
restraining
order
after
an
ex
parte
hearing
was
granted
to
the
mother
on
the
date
of
filing
in
march,
1979,
and
specifically
ordered
the
father
to
return
the
child
to
the
state
of
florida
pending
further
litigation
on
the
matter.
the
father,
the
respondent,
did
not
answer
whatsoever
in
this
florida
proceeding.
instead--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--that's
correct.
he
was
personally
served
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
with
all
the
process
in
georgia.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
it
was
a
georgia
law
enforcement
officer.
there
has
never
been
any
question
concerning
his
having
actual
notice,
nor
of
the
sufficiency
of
service
in
this
case.
but
he
did
not
file
an
answer
and
instead
turned
around
ten
days
later
and
over
a
month
after
he
had
taken
the
child
from
florida
and
filed
an
independent
action
in
the
superior
court
of
berrien
county
requesting
custody
of
the
minor
child.
he
did
not
alert
that
court
to
any
pending
proceedings
in
florida.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
of
course,
the
legal
custody
of
the
child
still
remains.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our...
for
mrs.
webb
to
now
regain
custody
she
would
have
to
seek
a
modification,
she
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
in
georgia,
and
since
we
have
a
pending
proceeding
that
isn't
possible
at
this
time.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
your
honor,
the
respondent
right
now
has
every
right
to
go
to
the
state
of
florida
to
remove
that
child.
he
would
even
be
able
to
seek
the
assistance
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
get
the
return
of
the
child
now,
so
we
are
in
a
very
precarious
position.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
the
new
federal
statute,
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act,
from
everything
i
can
determine
is
not
effective
until
july
1,
1981.
it
does
provide
a
series
of
enforcement
mechanisms
for
custody
decrees
and
it's
impossible
to
say
exactly
what
effect
it
would
have
had
on
this
case
had
it
been
effective.
obviously,
its
intent
is
to
provide
an
enforcement
mechanism
for
custody
decrees,
even
custody
decrees
that
would
not
be
enforceable
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
because
of
lack
of
finality
and
other
problems.
but,
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
we
really
at
this
point
do
not
know
what
that
effect
would
have
been
on
our
case.
after
the
respondent
did
not
answer
in
the
florida
proceeding,
and
after
he
had
commenced
his
proceeding
in
georgia,
the
florida
court
did
hold
a
full
hearing
on
the
issue,
even
though
he
was
in
default.
and
at
that
hearing
they
entertained
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
and
made
the
following
determinations.
(1)
they
determined
that
florida
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
that
the
petitioner
and
the
minor
child
were
residents
of
the
state
of
florida
and
that
the
minor
child's
absence
from
the
state
of
florida
did
not
affect
his
status
as
resident
of
that
state.
secondly,
they
found
that
they
would
recognize
the
georgia
decree
and
would
establish
this
decree
in
the
state
of
florida.
and
according
to
respondent
and
the
amicus
curiae,
that's
all
they
did.
but
of
course
the
record
indicates
otherwise.
the
court
went
on
and
found
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
to
modify
visitation,
not
just
parroting
the
petitioner's
request
for
modification
of
visitation,
but
setting
out
a
full
schedule
of
visitation
which
really
did
in
no
way
decrease
the
respondent's
visitation
rights.
and
lastly,
and
really
most
importantly,
the
florida
court
reviewed
the
other
provisions
of
the
georgia
decree
that
were
in
force
at
that
time
and
determined
that
there
was
no
reason
to
change
any
of
those
provisions,
that
they
should
remain
in
full
force
and
effect.
and,
of
course,
one
of
those,
the
major
one
of
those,
was
that
the
custody
remained
with
the
petitioner.
after
the
florida
judgement
was
rendered,
the
petitioner
filed
an
answer
with
the
georgia
court,
or
amended
the
answer
she
had
already
filed
with
the
georgia
court
and
informed
the
georgia
court
that
the
florida
court
had
already
rendered
a
final
judgment
and
requested
in
her
motion
to
dismiss
that,
as
we
have
indicated
earlier,
that
the
florida
judgment
be
afforded
full
faith
and
credit
in
georgia.
the
georgia
court,
nevertheless,
held
a
hearing
on
the
matter
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
restricted
the
testimony
to
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent.
after
hearing
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
it
entered
a
final
order
completely
in
favor
of
the
respondent,
awarding
him
custody
of
the
minor
child.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
she
filed
her
answer
in
march,
1979,
and
also
at
that
time
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
she
informed
the
court
at
that
time
that
there
was
a
pending
proceeding
in
florida.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no;
no.
the
first
thing
that
occurred
in
the
georgia
proceeding
after
the
filing
on
march
24--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--no,
except
to
indicate
that
he
had
not
made
that
disclosure.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
we
had
filed
an
answer
previously,
but,
of
course,
all
we
could
alert
the
court
to
was
that
there
was
a
pending
florida
proceeding
and
ask
them
to
decline
jurisdiction
and
allow
florida
to
decide
the
entire
matter.
then,
after
the
final
judgment
was
rendered,
we
amended
that
answer,
informing
them
of
the
final
judgment,
and
at
that
time
requesting
that
it
be
accorded
full
faith
and
credit.
in
the
georgia
court
order
it
did
not
mention
whatsoever
the
florida
proceeding
or
the
florida
judgment.
there
was
no
ruling
whatsoever
as
to
the
significance
of
either
and
it
also
found
a
material
change
of
circumstances
justifying
its
change
of
custody
based
on
events
all
of
which
had
occurred
months
and
even,
in
several
cases,
a
year
and
half
prior
to
the
rendition
of
the
florida
order.
from
the
order
of
the
superior
court
of
berrien
county
we
did
appeal
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
enumerate
this
error
and
failure
of
the
georgia
trial
court
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
this
florida
decree.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
i
presume
they
thought
that
they
didn't
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
of
the
state
grounds
that
they
dealt
with,
but
they
did
find
that
it
was
a
final
judgment
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
then
they
turned
around
in
the
next
few
sentences
and
said
that
that
had
no
effect,
or
did
not
preempt
jurisdiction.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
one
of
my
enumerations
of
error
was
that
the
georgia
court
just
declined--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--i
presume,
your
honor,
that
they
thought
they
could
make
a
decision
on
that
ground
alone
and
not
deal
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue.
that
was
one
of
our
enumerations
of
error.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
we
referred
to
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
final
florida
judgment.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
we
didn't
cite
any
constitutional
provisions.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
your
honor,
in
many
cases
i
think
the
failure
to
cite
the
u.s.
constitution
would
lead
to
confusing
results.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
in
the
cases
dealing
with
due
process,
for
instance,
this
court
has
held
that--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--in
cases
dealing
with
due
process
this
court
has
held
that
a
failure
to
specify
which
provision
of
the
constitution--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--pardon?
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that
the
failure
to
give
the
exact
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
doesn't
sufficiently
raise
a
federal
issue?
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
i
can
cite
to
you
cases
which
have
held
that
if
it
is
explicit
in
the
entire
record
that
the
issue
was
appropriately
raised,
then
this
court
can
decide
the
federal
claim.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that's
correct.
we
did
not
cite
to
article
iv,
section
1,
of
the
united
states
constitution,
but
we
feel
that
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
it
has
no
other
reference.
it's
not
something
that
the
court
can
mistake
as
being
a
reference
to
a
state
constitution
provision
for
full
faith
and
credit.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
that
would
be
our
feeling
about
the
case
because,
of
course,
they
did
indicate,
they
recognized
that
the
florida
judgment
was
final,
had
been
rendered
three
weeks
before,
and
yet
then
they
went
on
and
said,
nevertheless,
the
georgia
court
has
jurisdiction.
so
it
indicates
that
their
obvious
result
was
that
there
was
no
full
faith
or
credit
afforded.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
we
understood
at
that
point
that
we
did--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--no,
your
honor.
of
course,
in
the
state
court,
we
had
a
number
of
grounds
for
enumerations
of
error
and
here
it
is
our
only
ground
and
then
of
course
we've
raised
it
very
specifically.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
of
course,
the
act
specifically
refers
to
itself
as
being
a
comity-based
statute
and
does
not
of
course
have
anything
to
do
with
anything
related
to
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
united
states
constitution.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that's
correct;
as
a
matter
of
comity,
by
making
laws
more
uniform
in
order
to
have
it
recognized.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
we
would
argue
that
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
of
course,
changes
state
law,
but
it
does
eventually
allow,
mandates
for
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
u.s.
constitution,
and
to
that
extent,
yes,
but
the
act
itself
does
not
mandate
full
faith
and
credit
be
given.
in
rephrasing
the
issue
that
we
stated
earlier,
really
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
judgment
rendered
in
this
case
and
to
afford
it
the
same
measure
of
full
faith
and
credit
as
it
would
render
or
accord
to
any
other
judgment
regardless
of
its
nature
as
a
custody
decree.
we
can
find
no
evidence
in
either
article
iv,
section
1,
or
in
the
earlier
opinions
of
this
court
that
would
indicate
that
just
by
its
nature,
as
a
custody
decree,
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
obviously,
there's
nothing
in
the
exact
wording
of
article
i,
section
4,
that
says
anything
regarding
custody
decrees.
in
the
four
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
prior
to
this
time
in
which
a
custody
decree
was
sought
to
be
accorded
full
faith
and
credit,
this
court
has
examined
the
custody
decree
to
determine
whether
it
mandates
full
faith
and
credit
to
be
applied
to
other
judgments
and
found
that
the
very
custody
decree
examined
did
not
meet
certain
requirements
and
the
two
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
previously
have
been
the
lack
of
due
process
afforded
to
the
defendant
in
the
proceeding
and
also
in
the
past,
the
lack
of
finality
that
custody
decrees
were
accorded
in
the
state
in
which
they
were
rendered.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
your
honor,
i
believe
the
exact
language
of
the
statute
says
that
when
a
court
is
informed
that
there
is
a
prior
pending
proceeding,
that
the
court
of
the
second
state
is
to
communicate
with
the
court
of
the
first
state,
but--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--that's
correct.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that's
correct.
the
florida
proceeding
was
pending
and
there
has
been
no
dispute
that
it
was
pending
several
weeks
before
the
institution
of
the
georgia
proceeding
and
the
court--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--pardon?
ms.
mary
r.
carden
well,
i
think
now
the
act
is
becoming
more
familiar
to
judges.
they
are
beginning
to
communicate
with
each
other
and
trying
to
informally
resolve
these
differences.
i'm
sure
that
there
are
going
to
be
exceptions
to
this.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that
is
what
the
georgia
supreme
court
held.
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute
actually
says
the
court
of
the
second
state
has
the
obligation
to
confer
with
the
state
in
which
the
original
proceeding
is
pending
first.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
of
course,
but
in
georgia...
and
georgia
may
be
very
unique
in
this
sense,
georgia
courts
do
not
exercise
any
continuing
jurisdiction
once
the
decree
is
rendered,
so
once
the
decree
is
rendered
they
lose
their
jurisdiction
unless
a
second
suit
is
instituted
under
similar
residence
and
venue
requirements,
so
there
was
nothing
pending
in
georgia.
the
georgia
courts
don't
even
construe
it
to
be--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--if,
according
to
the
uniform
act,
the
parties
had...
well,
everything
had
gone
as,
i
think,
the
uniform
act
considers
it,
upon
learning
of
the
pending
florida
proceeding...
and
the
georgia
court
did
know
of
that
long
before
the
order
was
rendered
in
florida...
there
would
have
been
communication
between
the
courts
concerning
which
was
the
appropriate
forum
and
how
the
best
manner
in
which
evidence
could
be
taken
could
be
arranged.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
i
think
that
the
courts
themselves
can
determine
which
is
the
most
appropriate
forum
and
upon
that
decision
have
the
hearing.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
had
there
been...
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
impossible
for
the
georgia
court
to
have
had
jurisdiction
had
there
not
been
a
final
judgment
rendered
in
the
state
of
florida,
without
that
final
judgment
rendered
in
the
state
of
florida.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
there's
no
remedy
provided
in
that
regard,
in
the
statutory
law.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
there's
no
penalty
or
remedy
provided
for
the
failure
to
comply
with
any
of
these
sections.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
yes,
i
think
the
only...
really
the
two
sections
of
the
uniform
act
that
are
important
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue,
one,
are
the
provisions
which
provide
for
due
process
to
be
afforded
to
the
respondent,
which
of
course
is
required
under
full
faith
and
credit.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
the
act--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--in
a
comity-based
sense
the
act
says
that
if
one
state
has
rendered
a
judgment
in
compliance
with
the
act,
then
the
other
state
shall
honor
it.
that's
the
provision
of
the
act.
of
course,
that's
based
on
comity.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
it's
not,
and
the
only
other
provision
of
the
act,
other
than
the
due
process
provisions
which
do
afford
jurisdiction
to
the--
ms.
mary
r.
carden
--that's
correct.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
it
says
"shall".
"shall
enforce"
the
statute.
the
only
other
section
of
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
that's
really
relevant
is
the
section
which
does
make
custody
decrees
final,
binding,
and
conclusive,
and
does
take
away
the
previous
status
of
the
law
which
kept
them
on
the
breast
of
the
court,
modifiable
at
any
time,
and
i
think
those
are
the
only
two
areas
where
the
act
really
has
relevance.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
had
hoped
that
that
would
occur
after
the
child
was
exchanged
in
november.
we
had
hoped
that
there
would
be
an
agreement
be
the
parties
but
evidently
the
respondent
has
not
been
willing
to
do
so,
and
as
a
result
we
have
no
assurance
as
to
the
continuing
legal
status
of
the
child.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
i
hope
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
although
the
new
criminal
kidnapping
prevention
act
of
course
is
based
in
principles
of
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
and
it
would
be
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
interpretation
that
perhaps
has
been
handled
in
this
case,
and
there
could
be
similar
problems.
in
summary,
your
honor,
really
all
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
scrutinize
this
custody
decree
in
terms
of
the
mandates
for
full
faith
and
credit
to
any
other
judgment,
and
if
it
meets
those
mandates
for
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit,
to
apply
full
faith
and
credit
to
this
decree
and
allow...
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court,
not
affording
full
faith
and
credit
to
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
r.
carden
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
in
response
to
mr.
brown's
comments.
first
of
all,
of
course,
comity
as
we
mentioned
before
doesn't
demand
full
faith
and
credit
and
in
this
case
georgia
did
not
afford
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
decree,
regardless
of
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act.
so
no
decision
in
this
matter
even
thought
georgia
may
have
not
said,
we
don't
think
article
iv,
section
1,
does
not
apply,
the
opinion
still
is
there
that
georgia
under
precedent
of
webb
v.
webb
does
not
have
to
give
any
kind
of
importance
or
consideration
to
a
final
judgment
of
another
state
on
the
basis
of
that
decision.
also,
he
mentioned
the
case
of
halvey
v.
halvey.
and
at
that
time
florida
law
provided
that
custody
decrees
could
be
modified
even
on
the
basis
of
facts
that
were
not
before
the
court
at
the
time
of
its
original
decree,
and
i
believe
that
was
the
reason
that
this
court
had
such
a
difficult
time
applying
full
faith
and
credit
to
halvey.
since
that
time
that
law
has
been
changed
with
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
and
the
only
possibility
for
modification
does
deal
with
a
material
change
of
circumstances
occurring
after
the
original
decree.
one
cannot
go
back
and
question
the
decree.
finally,
he
mentioned
that
there
was,
as
he
called
it,
kind
of
a
rump
hearing
in
florida.
well,
his
client,
the
respondent,
was
given
every
opportunity
to
appear
and
to
raise
any
problems
or
any
of
the
facts
that
he
thought
were
there.
obviously,
the
florida
court
knew
of
the
events,
at
least
from
the
mother's
perspective
in
february,
because
the
restraining
order
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
appeared
before
the
court
at
that
time.
so
they...
and
they
held
a
full
hearing,
the
fact
that
the
father
didn't
appear
shouldn't
give
him
the
right
to
go
to
another
state
and
file
a
new
action.
