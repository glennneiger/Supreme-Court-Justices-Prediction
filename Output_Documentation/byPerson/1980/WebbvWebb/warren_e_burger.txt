we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
webb
v.
webb.
mrs.
carden,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
weren't
there
some
intervening
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
the
florida
authorities
get
into
the
act
in
that
interim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
is
the
real
controversy
that's
remaining,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
us
to
set
aside
the
florida
decree,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
not
wait
until
that
controversy
arises?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
carden,
if
the
parties
now
stipulated
to
vacate
the
georgia
judgment,
would
there
be
any
case
left
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
there
were
a
repeat
performance
after
july
1,
1981,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
either,
would
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
carden
has
conceded...
we
wouldn't
necessarily
hold
her
to
that...
she
has
conceded
that
if
the
act
were
in
effect
now,
there
would
be
no
case
at
all.
she
said,
if
it
was
only
a
problem
between
now
and
july
1...
now,
if
you're
telling
us
that
there's
no
problem
even
now,
between
now
and
july
1,
that
might
be
relevant.
i
suggest
that
you
submit
some
observations
on
that
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
you
seem
to
have
the
matter
well
in
the
front
of
your
mind,
perhaps
you
can
have
that
to
us
by
the
end
of
this
week?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
this
can
be
typewritten,
i
assure
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--if
we
followed
your
suggestion
of
a
dismissal,
there
would
be
no
holding
of
the
georgia
court
on
any
federal
question.
chief
justice
burger
you'd
just
like
them
to
raise
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
do
you
have
anything
further,
ms.
carden?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
