justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
georgia
supreme
court
didn't
say
a
word
about
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
regard
that
as
a
disposition
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
argument?
justice
white
i
thought
one
of
your
major
points
was
that
the
georgia
courts
didn't
follow
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
have
a
separate
section
in
your
brief
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
arguing
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
argued
the
statutory
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
uniform
act
is
to,
as
some
point,
to
persuade
some
state
to
respect
the
judgment
of
another
state,
and
so
that,
to
call
it,
it
might
be
perfectly
natural
to
refer
to
the
obligations
under
the
act
as
a
full
faith
and
credit
obligation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
attempts
to
convince
a
state
it
ought
to
give
some
respect
to
a
judgment
of
another
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
act
address
a
situation
where
one
state
enters
a
final
judgment
like
the
florida
court
did
here,
and
yet
another
state
goes
ahead,
like
georgia
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
purport
to
permit
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
georgia
statute.
i
suppose
if
a
georgia
trial
judge,
after
being
informed
of
a
final
judgment
being
entered
in
a
florida
court,
if
he
went
ahead
and
nevertheless
entered
a
judgment
of
his
own,
he
might
be
reversed
in
a
georgia
court
on
the
grounds
that
he's
violated
the
state
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
obligatory.
it
just
isn't
a
matter
of
comity,
i
mean.
the
statute
says,
you
must...
does
it
say
that?
justice
white
well,
you
certainly
didn't
held
us
much
in
your
response
to
the
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
say
the
state
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
the
petition
said
that
the
issue
had
been
raised,
and
we
no
longer
require
the
filing
of
records
with
our
petitions
for
certiorari,
like
we
did
historically.
and
so,
nor...
it's
not
unusual
to
credit
a
statement
of
a
petitioner
if
the
respondent
doesn't
say
something
about
it,
doesn't
challenge
it.
and
it
wasn't
challenged
here.
justice
white
you're
appointed
by
us?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
we
wouldn't
decide
that
in
the
first
instance,
probably.
