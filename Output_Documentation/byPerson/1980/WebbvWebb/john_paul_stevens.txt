justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
carden,
didn't
the
georgia
supreme
court
say
both
trial
courts
were
at
fault
in
failing
to
contact
the
other
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
the
question
is,
which
is
the
second
state?
in
a
sense,
florida
was
the
second
state
because
the
decree
was
originally
a
georgia
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
of
what
the
georgia
court
should
have
done?
supposing
the
georgia
court
had
called
up
the
florida
judge
and
said,
well,
we've
entered
this
decree
down
here,
there
was
an
ex
parte
hearing,
and
the
wife
testified
and
so
forth.
but
we
really
didn't
have
a
full
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
there
had
been
changed
circumstances
since
the
original
decree.
wouldn't
they
then
have
gone
ahead
and
had
the
full
hearing
he
did
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
in
one
court
or
the
other
it
would
have
been
proper
then
to
hold
a
hearing
on
whether
there'd
been
changed
circumstances?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
admit
that,
then
you're
not
saying
that
the
georgia
court
was
obliged
to
enter
the
same
decree
that
the
florida
court
had
entered?
justice
stevens
he's
merely
obliged
take
it
into
account
in
deciding
what
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brown,
could
they
do
that
even
now?
in
other
words,
could
not
the
mother
file
some
kind
of
amendment
in
the
florida
action
and
say,
well,
there've
been
changed
circumstances
in
the
last
six
months,
the
child's
back
in
florida,
you've
got
jurisdiction
over
me
and
the
child,
please
call
the
florida
judge
on
the
phone
and
let's
have
somebody
try
this
thing
out
with--
