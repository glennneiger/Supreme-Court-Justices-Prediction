ms.
carden,
before
you
go
on?
justice
jr.
how
are
you
here?
justice
jr.
how
did
you
get
here?
did
you
raise
these
federal
questions
below?
justice
jr.
did
you
cite
the
federal
constitution?
justice
jr.
now,
you
started
to
say
that
you
raised
it
in
your?
justice
jr.
and
what
form
did
that
take?
justice
jr.
again
any
reference
to
the
constitution?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
ms.
carden,
i
gather
the
youngster
is
back
with
her
mother
now
in
florida.
justice
jr.
what's
there
left
to
fight
over?
justice
jr.
but
he's
turned
the
child
back
to
the
mother?
justice
jr.
has
he
indicated
that
he
wants
the
child
back,
ever?
justice
jr.
did
he
say
why
he
was
surrendering
the
child?
justice
jr.
service
was
made
on
him
in
georgia,
was
it?
justice
jr.
who
was
the
law
enforced
by,
georgia
or
florida?
justice
jr.
can
he
do
that
under
the
new
federal
statute?
justice
jr.
when
did
the
mother
first
acquaint
the
georgia
court
with
the
action
in
florida?
justice
jr.
had
anything
occurred
in
the
georgia
proceeding
up
to
that
time?
justice
jr.
you
mentioned
earlier
that
the
father
had
brought
this
proceeding
in
georgia
without
informing
the
georgia
court
of
the
pendency
of
the
florida
proceeding,
but
as
i
now
understand
it
that
was
of
no
significance.
justice
jr.
because,
right
after
the
completion
of
the
florida
proceeding
you
then
filed
an
answer
which
fully
acquainted
the
georgia
court
with
everything
that
had
happened
in
florida?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
ms.
carden,
i
gather
this
uniform
statute,
it
mandates,
doesn't
it,
that
the
judge
in
florida
communicate
with
the
judge
in
georgia?
justice
jr.
so
that
if
there
was
a
deficiency--
justice
jr.
--it
was
on
the
part
of
the
georgia
judge--
justice
jr.
--not
calling
the
florida
judge
after
he
learned
of
the
pendency
of
the
florida
action,
correct?
justice
jr.
have
you
had
any
experience
with
that
provision?
justice
jr.
have
you
had
any
experience
with
that
provision?
justice
jr.
i
wish
that
had
been
in
effect
about
30
years
ago.
justice
jr.
well,
that's
your
full
faith
and
credit
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
tell
me,
does
the
statute
say...
you
suggest
that
it's
the
georgia
judge
who
should
have
called
florida
judge
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
does
the
statute
say
what
happens
if
the
georgia
judge
didn't
telephone
the
florida
judge?
justice
jr.
i
mean,
no
suggestion
that
a
failure
to
call
the
florida
judge
meant
a
loss
of
jurisdiction
in
the
georgia
court,
is
it?
justice
jr.
why
do
you
suppose
your
supreme
court
didn't
cite
it's
own
rule
45?
justice
jr.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask,
mr.
brown,
what
about
the
return
by...
he's
your
client
now...
of
the
child
to
the
mother?
justice
jr.
well,
does
the
mother
live
with
her
mother?
justice
jr.
did
your
client
say
why
he
didn't
want
to
keep
the
child?
justice
jr.
but
you
just
wonder
what--
justice
jr.
well,
anyway,
mr.
brown,
if
there
is
a
cullable
possibility
that
the
act
is
in
effect,
i
suppose
what
we'd
do
is
send
it
back
for
reconsideration
under
the
act.
justice
jr.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
printed.
justice
jr.
this
is
not
a
uniform
act
that
the
congress
consented
to,
is
it?
i
mean,
it's
not
a
compact?
justice
jr.
an
interstate
compact.
justice
jr.
among
the
states.
