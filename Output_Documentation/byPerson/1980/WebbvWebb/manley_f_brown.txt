mr.
manley
f.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
knows
from
our
brief,
the
primary
thrust
of
the
respondent
is
that
this
is
not,
this
case
is
not
the
proper
vehicle
for
this
court
to
address
the
serious
constitutional
law
problems
which
would
be
presented
by
this
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
well,
begging
the
court's
pardon,
i
personally
didn't
file
that,
in
defense
of
myself.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
well,
of
course,
that's
the
main
problem
with
this
whole
case
is
that
nobody,
none
of
the
lawyers
in
the
court
below
ever
saw
any
of
these
issues.
they
were
never
dealt
with,
they
were
never
properly
raised,
the
georgia
supreme
court
never
addressed
them,
and
at
the
point
where
i
came
into
the
case--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--well,
i
thoroughly
agree
with
your
honor's
observation.
all
i'm
saying
in
defense
of
myself
is
that
i
did
not
file
a
response
to--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--i
was
appointed
by
the
court
after
the
case--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--arrived
at
this
level.
and
at
that
point
i
raised
every
conceivable
point
that
immediately
occurred
to
me,
namely,
that
the
point
had
not
been
properly
raised
in
the
georgia
supreme
court.
because
the
portion
of
the
record
that
fully
exposes
the
fact
that
this
issue
was
never
even
thought
of
in
the
court
below
is
the
motion
for
rehearing
filed
by
the
petitioner.
if
you
look
at
it
at
page
52
of
the
joint
appendix
and
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
under
georgia
law
a
motion
for
rehearing
addressed
itself
to
telling
the
court
wherein
you
have
made
a
mistake.
it's
supposed
to
be
used
to
point
out
to
the
georgia
court
precisely
what
they
did
wrong.
and
it's
supposed
to
be
to
some
extent
a
predicate
for
a
certiorari
petition
to
this
court.
if
you
look
at
the
motion
for
rehearing,
you'll
see
that
it
states
only
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
ignored
relevant
georgia
precedent
and
that
it
rendered
a
decision
on
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
uniform
act.
it
never
mentioned
in
any
form,
shape,
or
fashion
whatsoever
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
federal
constitution,
article
iv,
section
1.
now,
those
words
were
used
a
couple
of
times
in
the
record
but
they
were
never
used
with
very
much
precision,
and
ordinarily
the
georgia
supreme
court
would
not
totally
ignore
that
issue.
as
you
look
at
other
decisions
of
the
court
you
see
that
they
have
dealt
with
full
faith
and
credit,
and
at
least
they
would
have
graced
the
contention
by
saying
that
it
lacked
merit.
as
it
is,
they
didn't
even
mention
it.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
exactly.
they
were
complaining
that
the
majority
had
returned
to
authorization
of
child
snatching
and
had
misconstrued
that.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
i
have
no
idea.
i
imagine
they
just
were
never
aware
that
the
enumeration
of
error
was
intended
to
even
raise
a
federal
constitutional
provision,
because
they
regularly
cite
rule
45
as
to
enumerations
of
error
which
have
not
been
supported
by
evidence.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
the
child
is
not
with
the
mother
but
the
child
is
with
the
maternal
grandmother.
that's
in
my
brief,
the
initial
brief
i
filed.
i
was
advised
of
that
by
prior
counsel
in
the
case.
since
that
time
i
have
been
advised
by
mr.
webb...
i
made
that
specific
inquiry
of
him
last
week,
because
i
knew
the
court
would
ask
about
it...
and
he
advised
me
again
that
the
child
is
with
his
ex-wife's
mother,
and
not
returned
to
the--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--no,
she
lives
somewhere
else.
she
lives
i
think,
in
jacksonville,
florida,
and
the
mother
lives
on
in
gainesville,
so
frankly
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
because
i
haven't
seen
with
my
own
eyes
where
the
child
is.
i
know
the
father
does
not
have
the
child
and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
maternal
grandmother
does
have
the
child.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
no,
sir.
and
frankly,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
understand.
that's
one
of
a
number
of
things
about
this
case,
that
as
a
practical
matter,
as
a
lawyer,
you
don't
understand.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
he
doesn't
want
his
wife
to
have
the
child
back.
he's
adamant
about
that,
and
adamant
about
continuing
in
this
court
and
not
entering
into
the
stipulation
that
they've
invited,
because
i've
asked
him
to
do
that,
because
it
would
have
eliminated
my
job
in
this
court
and
would
have
eliminated
the
court's
work.
now,
in
addition
to
the
other
points
that
we
raised
in
our
brief,
and
suggested
to
the
court,
that
this
case
ought
not
be
heard
on
the
merits,
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
connection
with
this
new
federal
act,
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act
of
1980,
it's
not
at
all
clear,
i
don't
think,
that
that
particular
act
goes
into
effect
only
on
july
1
of
1981.
i
think,
in
being
candid
with
the
court,
some
argument
can
be
made...
and
i'm
not
sure
which
one
of
us
would
win
under
the
act,
but
i
think
a
reasonable
argument
can
be
made
that
the
act
became
effective
on
december
28
when
president
carter
signed
the
act
into
law.
i
say
that
because
the
act
was
part
of
some
social
security
amendments
dealing
with
pneumococcal
vaccine
services
and
the
delayed
effective
date
act,
if
you
read
the
language
carefully,
you
see
that
it
refers
only
to
services
provided,
which
clearly
indicates
that
the
delayed
effective
date
act
refers
to
the
pneumococcal
vaccine
amendment
and
not
to
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act.
there
are
two
other
delayed
effective
dates
in
that
legislative
package,
both
relating
to
other
sections.
there
is
no
suggestion
whatsoever
in
the
act
that
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act
of
1980
is
to
have
a
delayed
effective
date
until
july
1,
1981.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
act
was
passed
sort
of
at
the
11th
hour,
and
i
don't
think
we
even
had
a
copy
of
it
until
after
i
filed
the
brief
and
the
reason
i'm
mentioning
it
to
you
in
oral
argument
is
because
it's
not
in
the
brief,
to
try
to
give
the
court
that
information.
and
if
we
need
to
supplement
that
by
way
of
additional
brief,
we'll
do
it,
with
the
court's
permission.
in
addition
to
that,
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
act
indicates
that
it
was
considered
as
part
of
several
legislative
packages.
in
none
of
those
legislative
undertakings
was
it
ever
suggested
that
the
act
should
have
a
delayed
effective
date.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
with
the
court's
permission
we
would
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
that
point,
if
the
court
desires.
frankly,
i
don't
know
who
wins
under
the
new
act;
it's
not
that
clear.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
well,
i
think
you
could
look
at
the
act
in
connection
with
the
principles
of
bradley
v.
school
board
of
richmond,
as
to
whether
you
would
apply
an
act
which
came
into
being
while
the
case
was
on
appeal.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
i
don't
see
any
need
to
do
it.
i'm
just
saying
that
the
court
could,
if
it
saw
fit
to
do
so.
at
any
rate,
if
the
act,
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
act
does
not
come
into
effect
until
july
1,
1981,
it
still
has
such
an
impact
on
this
case
that
it
sterilizes
the
constitutional
issues
in
the
case
insofar
as
this
particular
proceeding
is
concerned
so
that
it
really
does
not
make
sense
for
this
court
to
get
into
these
constitutional
issues
when
an
act
of
congress
pursuant
to
article
iv,
section
1,
is
purporting
to
deal
with
this.
now,
i
realize
that
this
act
still
doesn't
cure
the
monumental,
necessarily
cure
the
monumental
personal
jurisdiction
problem
that
underlies
this
whole
problem
between
the
states,
but
still
it's
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
and
i
think
the
court
under
the
doctrine
of
such
cases
as
rice
v.
sioux
memorial
park
should
consider
that
even
though
the
act
is
not
in
effect
now,
it
has
such
an
impact
on
this
case
that
it
would
render
of
isolating
significance
this
particular
case.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
all
right,
sir.
we'll
endeavor
to
do
that.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
now,
there's
one
other
issue
that
was
not
adequately
briefed
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
it
has
to
do
with
a
question
of
cooperation
between
the
florida
and
the
georgia
courts
and
what
florida
should
have
done.
frankly,
there
was
a
provision
of
this
uniform
act
that's
never
been
mentioned
that
in
preparation
for
oral
argument
i
came
across
it,
and
it
said
that--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--well,
this
provision
has
something
to
do,
i
think,
with
personal
jurisdiction
and
how
to
go
about
handling
the
act
without
triggering
this
type
of
question
and
causing
it
to
come
to
this
court.
that's
section
19(b)
of
the
uniform
act,
which
is
not
exactly
like
the
uresa
provisions
which
this
court
discussed
in
kulko,
in
the
footnotes
in
kulko.
19(b)
does
authorize
the
florida
judge
when
a
proceeding
like
this
is
filed
to
contact
the
georgia
judge
and
ask
the
georgia
court
to
initiate
a
proceeding
over
their
resident
over
whom
they
have
personal
jurisdiction
compelling
him
to
come
to
florida
to
participate
in
this
child
custody
decision
and
the
georgia
act
has
the
correlative
section
which
is
20(c)
which
says
that
if
they
get
a
request
from
a
florida
judge,
they
are
bound
to
exercise
personal
jurisdiction
over
their
resident
and
require
the
resident
to
go
to
florida.
so
that,
what
i'm
saying
is,
it
was
unnecessary
to
get
into
the
constitutional
problems
that
you
have
in
this
case
if
the
petitioner
had
simply
utilized
the
provisions
that
were
available
in
the
act.
they
could
have
compelled
mr.
webb
under
penalty
of
contempt
in
berrien
superior
court
in
georgia
to
go
to
florida,
and
this
case,
i
submit,
would
never
be
here.
and
i
think
that's
another
reason
why
this
court
should
consider
just
dismissing
the
case.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
certainly.
i
think
this
thing
is
still
a
wide-open
issue,
i
think
it's
the
problem
that
this
court
has
always
seen
with
child
custody
decrees,
they're
never
final,
there
are
no
vested
rights
in
this
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
changed
circumstances,
obviously.
my
client
doesn't
even
have
the
child
now.
the
child
is
back
with
the
maternal
grandmother.
so
we're
up
here
disputing
about
something
that
is
already
changed
and
under
halvey
and
the
other
decrees,
under
other
cases
of
this
court
that
have
recognized
that
proposition
it'd
be
satisfactory
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
trial
judge
and
say,
judge,
find
out
what
happened
in
this
case.
what's
going
on?
why
is
the
child
gone?
who
has
the
child,
and
what
disposition
should
be
made?
it
just
means
that
there's
no
reason
for
this
court
to
get
involved
in
something
that
raises
serious
and
difficult
questions
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
absolutely
not,
because
the
georgia
court
never
followed
the
federal
question.
if
you
look
at
the
georgia
cases
we
have
cited,
where
they've
dealt
with
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
and
attacks
on
that
act
of
a
constitutional
nature,
you'll
see
that
they
have
always
addressed
themselves
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
question
and
they've
merely
said,
we
aren't
concerned
with
full
faith
and
credit
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law
because
we
are
enforcing
this
act
under
comity.
that's
what
this
act
was
designed
to
be,
it
was
a
cooperative
effort
between
the
states.
georgia
didn't
buy
this
act
with
a
view
toward
having
this
court
telling
them
that
they
had
to
construe
the
act
a
certain
way,
by
virtue
of
article
iv,
section
1.
if
you
read--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--no,
sir.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
it's
just
a
uniform
act--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--somebody
lobbies
in
each
legislature,
and
if
they
want
to
pass
the
thing
they
put
it
into
effect,
and
that's
exactly
what
georgia
has
done
and
they
didn't
accept
it
on
the
basis
of
any
mandatory
full
faith
and
credit
type
of
compulsion,
and
the...
commissioners
noted
that,
specifically
to
section
12,
which
has
to
deal
with
the
binding
effect
of
res
judicata,
and
section
13
states
that
it's
not
intended
to
establish
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
nonresident.
it's
based
on
the
philosophy
of
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurrence
in,
i
believe,
may
v.
anderson,
where
he
said
a
state
may
not
be
bound
to
do
certain
things,
but
it
may
do
it
if
it
wants
to.
that's
all
that
the
act
is
based
on
and
it's
right
in
the
commissioner's
notes
and
it
makes
no
sense
to
me
at
all
to
try
to
apply
the
mandatory
standards
of
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
comity-based
act.
now,
this
case
to
some
extent
is
like
the
halvey
case.
it's
virtually
like
it
factually
in
that
you
have
a
florida
decree
which
was
not
recognized
in
a
sister
state.
in
halvey
new
york
didn't
recognize
the
florida
decree
and
what
this
court
said
there
was
that
under
florida
law
this
decree
could
have
been
changed
even
by
the
florida
court
on
the
basis
of
changed
circumstances.
so
new
york
didn't
do
anything
florida
couldn't
do,
and
we
say
that
georgia
didn't
do
anything
that
florida
couldn't
do.
the
decisions
are
in
our
brief
at
footnote
25,
three
cases
have
not
been
superseded
by
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act.
they
continue
to
be
cited
by
the
florida
courts
right
up
to
this
very
minute.
they're
still
good
law.
the
florida
court
didn't
hear
about
this
lady's
trip
to
miami,
when
she
left
this
six-year-old
child
at
home
alone
untended,
unattended,
and
georgia
did
hear
that
evidence
and
the
trial
judge
didn't
like
it.
that's
exactly
the
fact
that
caused
him
to
take
the
child
away
from
her.
now,
if
you
accepted
their
argument,
it
would
mean
that
no
court
could
ever
hear
about
her
misconduct.
no
court
could
ever
make
that
decision
because
all
you
do
under
the
uniform
act
is
run
next
door
and
file
a
decree,
you
don't
even
have
to
file
under
other
proceedings.
in
a
couple
of
decisions
that
this
court
has
suggested
in
the
past,
i
think
riley
and
williams
v.
north
carolina,
that
you
have
to
file
another
action
in
order
to
make
a
judgment
of
one
state
the
judgment
of
another
state.
but
this
act
allows
that
to
be
done
by
the
simple
act
of
filing.
and
it
would
be
a
terrible
precedent
if
a
parent
used
this
act--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--it
certainly
is
not.
but
what
i'm
saying,
if
you
did
what
the
petitioner
wants
you
to
do,
if
you
made
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
that
the
petitioner
wants,
then
you
are
giving
the
petitioner,
or
you
are
establishing
a
precedent
where
an
heir
apparent
can
hide
his
misconduct
right
behind
this
decree,
and
we
submit
that
that's
not--
mr.
manley
f.
brown
--do
i
want
you
to
get
rid
of
full
faith
and
credit?
mr.
manley
f.
brown
no,
sir,
i
don't
want
you
to
apply
it
in
this
case.
i
think
it
has
its
place.
mr.
manley
f.
brown
certainly,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
i
think
a
lawyer
ought
to
be
held
to
a
lawyer's
standards,
and
that
includes
raising
an
issue
at
the
earliest
possible
time,
and
if
they
mean
article
iv,
section
1,
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
they
got
to
say
that.
that's
our
position
in
that
regard.
the
irony
of
this
situation
is,
in
effect
what
they're
saying
is,
georgia,
you
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
your
own
decree.
and,
that
does
not
make
sense
to
me,
in
any
way
whatsoever.
this
was
a
georgia
decree.
they
went
through
a
perfunctory
type
of
proceeding
in
florida
where
changed
circumstances
weren't
even
considered,
just
adopted
the
georgia
act
and
turned
around
and
told
georgia
and
said,
now,
you've
lost
all
rights
to
deal
with
your
prior
decree.
that's
not
what
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
was
intended
for.
if
you
look
at
the
new
act,
section
(d)
of
the
new
act,
the
new
federal
act,
is
designed
to
protect
the
decree
of
the
original
court,
because
it
provides
in
that
act
that
there
shall
be
continuing
jurisdiction
in
the
court
which
renders
the
original
decree
and
it
forbids
another
state
such
as
florida,
in
this
case,
from
dealing
with
an
act,
dealing
with
a
prior
decree
from
a
sister
state.
and
finally,
i'll
just
mention,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
is
of
a
mind
to
ever
get
to
this,
but
if
you
got
over
the
problem
that
the
petitioner
wants
to
get
over,
the
problem's
about
not
properly
raising
this
question,
you
finally
get
around
to
the
merits.
then
you
get
into
this
first
class
question
of
personal
jurisdiction.
and
under
kulko
it
doesn't
look
like
the
court
is
going
in
that
direction.
it
would
require
a
liberalization
of
what
the
court
said
in
that
case.
and
we
submit
that
very
definitely
there
is
no
reason
to
do
that;
you
would
have
to
repudiate
may
v.
anderson,
and
the
court,
in
mr.
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
kulko,
cited
may
v.
anderson,
so
it
gave
the
case
a
pat
on
the
back.
it
didn't
lock
like
you
were
getting
ready
to
repudiate,
because
you
recited
it
in
that
decision.
and
our
basic
position
is,
there's
no
reason
to
get
that
far
and
to
get
into
that
type
of
difficult
problem
in
this
case.
under
this
new
act
the
issue
may
be
back
to
this
court.
it'll
certainly
be
in
a
different
form,
it'll
be
in
connection
with
the
new
act,
there
will
be
no
risk
of
the
court
handing
down
an
opinion
which
might
conflict
with
the
terms
of
that
act,
and
it
just
makes
good
sense
to
essentially
dismiss
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
improvidently
granted.
thank
you,
your
honors.
