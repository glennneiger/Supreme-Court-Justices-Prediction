justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
georgia
supreme
court
rules
of
practice
require
that
any
assignment
of
error
that's
not
supported
by
argument
or
case
citation
shall
be
deemed
abandoned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
briefs
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
the
record
somewhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
cite
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
carden,
in
the
absence
of
a
violation
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
in
a
case
like
this,
there's
no
federal
question
for
this
court
to
consider,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
a
state
court
can't
simply
evade
a
properly
preserved
federal
question
by
writing
an
opinion
saying
that
this
case
deals
with
a
state
law
and
simply
treating
state
issues.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
made
this
point
clear
in
an
answer
to
previous
question
from
me,
that
certainly
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
construe
the
uniform
act
unless
it
runs
afoul
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
in
some
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
weren't
alerted
to
the
fact
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
are
two
of
your
three
justices
dissenting
from
the
disposition
of
the
case,
at
joint
appendix
on
page
53,
and
none
of
them
refer
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
in
your
brief
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
really
have
no
jurisdiction
to
second
guess
the
georgia
supreme
court
on
the
interpretation
of
the
uniform
act.
