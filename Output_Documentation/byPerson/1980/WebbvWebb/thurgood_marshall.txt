ms.
carden,
can
you
tell
me
why
the
georgia
supreme
court
didn't
mention
the
words
"full
faith
or
credit"?
either
one
of
those
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
it
started
off
by
saving
that
the
case
was
there
"on
the
certain
provision
of
georgia's
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act,
code
annotated
74501.
"
that's
the
first
sentence
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
they
just
ignore
it?
my
question
is,
why
did
they
ignore
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say,
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
u.s.
constitution
in
your
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
cite
any
constitutional
provisions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
want
us
to
say
you
don't
have
to
cite
the
constitution
in
order
to
invoke
this
court's
limited
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
eagerly
waiting
for
you
to
give
me
the
citation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
of
the
cases...
you
cite
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
please
cite
me
one
case
that
says
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
ma'am.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
this
case...
well,
where
was
the
article
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
raised
in
your
case?
never.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
why
didn't
you
cite
it
here?
when
you
came
to
this
court
you
did
cite
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
this
the
first
time
you
heard
of
it,
eh?
is
that
the
first
time
you
heard
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
act
is
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
act
is
not
before
us.
justice
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
get
rid
of
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
marshall
yes,
sir.
