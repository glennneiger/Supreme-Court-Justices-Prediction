mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
a
few
things
about
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
had
a
maintenance
contract
with
the
greenpark
nursing
home.
under
that
contract
greenpark
paid
the
labor
cost
of
the
petitioner's
employees
plus
a
weekly
management
fee
which
was
originally
$500
and
then
was
cut
down
to
$250.
petitioner
experienced
difficulties
in
making
out
with
the
reduced
management
fee
and
wanted
greenpark
to
increase
it
back
to
a
$500
weekly
fee.
in
the
meantime,
the
union
was
certified
by
the
labor
board
as
the
representative
of
petitioner's
employees.
the
union
made
a
demand
for
bargaining
which
petitioner
did
not
respond
to.
when
it
could
not
work
out
its
monetary
difficulties
with
greenpark,
it
gave
notice
that
it
would
terminate
the
contract,
which
was
terminable
on
30
days
notice,
and
then
two
days
before
the
end
of
the
30
days
it
told
the
employees
that
they
were
going
to
be
terminated.
and
that
was
the
first
word
that
the
union
had
that
petitioner
had
a
monetary
problem.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
had
they
given
them
30
days,
it
is
conceivable,
given
the
type
of
monetary
problem
that
petitioner
had,
that
the
union
would
have
been
able
to
bargain
over
ways
of
reducing
the
labor
costs
that
would
have
enabled
petitioner
to
remain
with
the
contract.
because
petitioner
did
not
just
go
out
of
business.
it
remained
in
business
at
its
other,
at
the
other
nursing
homes
that
it
was
servicing.
it
was
willing
to
remain
in
business
here,
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
its
top
officials,
if
the
union
could
work
out
the
problem,
but
the
point
is
that
at
that
time
there
was
no
time
left
to
negotiate,
because
the
petitioner
took
the
position
that
it
was
under
no
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
its
decision
to
terminate
its
operation.
now,
as
far
as
the
effects
bargaining
is
concerned,
it
is
true
that
two
years
after
the
contract
was
terminated
and
when
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
parties
did
engage
in
effects
bargaining
and
according
to
the
stipulation
in
the
record
some
provision
for
severance
pay
to
the
employees
was
made.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
why
in
the
board's
view
a
blanket
exemption
from
the
statute
for
so-called
partial
closing
decisions
is
not
necessary
to...
well,
first
of
all,
it
does
not
effectuate
the
statutory
purposes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
depends
upon
the
reasons
for
the
decision.
there
are
some
partial
closing
decisions
that
turn
upon
financial
or
other
investment
decisions
that
bargaining,
that
there
is
little
that
a
union
could
contribute
through
the
give
and
take
of
the
bargaining
process.
in
those
cases
the
board
has
not
required
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
type
of
considerations
that
go
into
a
decision
to
terminate
an
operation,
as
we
have
here.
in
many
cases
the
reason
to
terminate
on
economic
grounds
relates
to
considerations
of
labor
costs,
labor
productivity.
or
where
concessions
in
those
areas
could
alter
the
decision
to
close.
experience
has,
as
shown,
particularly
in
the
corollary
of
cohen,
where
as
a
result
of
give
and
take
on
these
issues
between
management
and
labor,
plant
closings
have
been
averted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
know
that
the
board
has
had
that
case
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
cases
that
suggest
that
the
board
would
find
that
there
might
not
be
an
obligation
in
that
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
because
under--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--8(a)(3).
ah--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
as
i've
pointed
out
to
justice
brennan,
i
don't
recall
such
a
case,
but
i
am
confident,
at
least
in
my
reading
of
the
analogous
situations,
that
the
board
would
be
unlikely
to
find
a
bargaining
obligation
in
that
sort
of
a
situation.
but
that
is
poles
apart
from
the
situation
that
we
have
here
and
the
situation
that
we
have
in
many
of
the
termination
cases.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
judge
adams
in
the
brockway
case
summed
it
up
better
than
i
can
when
he
pointed
out
that
a
decision
to
close
down
can
be
motivated
by
a
variety
of
considerations.
on
some
considerations
the
union
is
not
a
very
helpful
interlocutor.
on
others,
it
may
very
well
be,
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
that
the
end
result
is
a
termination
of
employment,
a
termination
of
the
jobs
of
the
employees
which
put--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
a
situation
such
as
you
had
here,
where
the
only
reasons
that
this
employer
wanted
to
close
down
were,
as
he
put
it,
the
money
items,
and
the
money
items
were
such
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that
the
union
could
point
out
to
him
ways
in
which
the
money
problem
could
be
solved
and
the
operation
remain
in
operation,
that
is
a
situation
where
it
furthers
the
statutory
purpose
to
require
bargaining
first.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
sending
a
letter
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
or
likelihood
for
persuasion
that
sitting
down
at
the
bargaining
table--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
it
is
not
a
management
consultant
but
it
certainly
knows
about
what
wages--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
what
i'm
talking
about,
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
many
forms
and
is
happening
today--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--in
the
rubber
industry
and
in
the
auto
industry.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
did.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
know
about
that
plant,
but
there
are
instances
which
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
where
in
the
rubber
industry
and
in
other
auto
plants,
uaw
and
chrysler,
for
example,
before
the
loan
guarantee
statute
was
enacted,
did
bargain
about
the
decision
in
advance,
and
as
a
result
of
that
bargaining
the
union
did
agree
to
take
wage
cuts,
defer
pension
accruals,
defer
cost
of
living
increases,
with
the
result
that
the
plant
was
able
to
continue
operating.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
court
did.
it--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
the
board's
position,
and
i
should
point
out
that
this
is
a
position
that
has
evolved
over
time
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
it's
the
ozark
rule
as
modified
in
the
light
of
cases
subsequent
to--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
think
it
would;
i
think
it
would.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
there's
really
no
difference
other
than
perhaps
a
difference
in
formulation
between
the
court
of
appeals
position
and
that
of
the
court,
which
is
that
as
a
general
principle,
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
about
an
economic
decision
to
shut
down
a
part
of
an
operation,
absent
a
showing
that
such
bargaining
would
be
futile
or
significantly
interfere
with
the
employer's
right
to
manage
his
business.
i
don't
think
that
there
is,
as
i
say,
a
difference
between
the
board
and
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
we've
set
those
out
in
our
brief,
particularly
in
the
pages
40
to
41.
and...
or
actually
beginning
on
38.
i
think
one
of
the
first
exceptions
that
was
recognized
was
general
motors,
which
is
not
a
recent
decision,
where
general
motors
decided
to
sell--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--the
heart
of
this
case
was
illustrated
by
a
question
of
justice
brennan's
before
the
example
that
he
gave
of
the
closing
of
the
auto
plants.
you
have
here
a
situation
where
labor
cost
is
the
major
portion
of
this
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
no
capital
investment
at
all
and
that
greenpark,
the
nursing
home,
furnished
even
the
mops
and
the
pails
and
the
materials.
petitioner
furnished
only
labor.
in
that
sort
of
a
situation
the
case
is
very
close
to
fibreboard
because
the
chances
of
bargaining,
being
able
to
make
a
difference
in
the
decision
to
terminate
the
operation,
are
sufficiently
good
to
further
the
statutory
purpose
of
bringing
it
under
the
scope
of
bargaining.
in
fibreboard
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
reasons
for
the
employer's
decision
to
contract
out,
that
economies
could
be
derived
by
reducing
the
work
force,
decreasing
fringe
benefits,
and
eliminating
overtime
payments,
involved
matters
peculiarly
suitable
for
resolution
within
the
collective
bargaining
framework.
and
the
court
held
that
in
those
circumstances
the
chances
were
sufficiently
good
that
bargaining
would
be
able
to
work
out
a
resolution
of
the
problem,
that
the
statutory
purpose
would
be
served
by
bringing
it
within
the
area
of
mandatory
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
but
insofar
as
the
nursing
home
was
concerned,
all
it
was
concerned
about
was
in
paying
no
more
than
the
total
bill.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
it
is.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
was
certainly
no
indication
that
that
would
be
the
problem.
they
never
got
to
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
the
only
indication
is
that,
when
the
union
was
told
to
go
to
the
nursing
home
about
keeping
on
the
employees,
the
nursing
home
said
that,
we
can't
do
it
because
there's
a
clause
in
the
contract
the
precludes
us
from
hiring
any
of
the
petitioner's
employees
for
90
days.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
total
price
could
be
kept
where
it
is
if
the
union
were
willing
to
reduce
wages
or
introduce
some
productivity
changes
that
would
make
the
operation
more
efficient.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
earlier
in
the
year,
before
the
union
came
into
the
picture,
the
nursing
home
had
given
petitioner
a
notice
that
it
was
going
to
terminate
its
contract
because
a
state
inspection
had
found
that
its
employees
were
not
being
efficient
enough
and
petitioner
instituted
some
changes
in
procedures
that
improved
efficiency
and
enabled
them
to
continue
the
contract.
it's
not
necessary
to
guarantee
that
something
like
this
could
have
been
achieved.
all
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
further
the
statutory
purpose
is
to
have
a
situation
where,
as
in
fibreboard,
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
something
could
be
done.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
two
days
before.
and
it
didn't
even
announce
it
to
the
union.
it
announced
it
to
the
employees
who
in
turn
notified
the
union.
now--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
it
did
not,
because
at
the
time
the
contract
was
negotiated
the
union
had
not
been
certified
as
the
bargaining
representative
and
the
petitioner
and
the
union
never
got
to
negotiating
a
contract.
now,
if
there
were
a
duty
to
bargain
over
partial
closing
situations,
the
parties
can
in
their
contract
negotiations,
as
have
many
employers,
worked
out
in
advance
of
a
termination
the
conditions
for
notice
and
the
amount
of
bargaining--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
the
duty
to
bargain
imposes
a
legal
obligation
that
might...
there
was
no
contract
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
the
contract
was
between--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
i
think
you
misunderstand
me,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
without
a
contract
there
would
be
a
duty
to
bargain.
nowever,
in
negotiating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
the
parties
can
in
their
negotiations
define
the,
or
restrict
the
limits
of
the
bargaining
obligation,
and
there
are
contract
provisions
that
provide
for
advance
notice,
what
sort
of
bargaining
if
any
has
to
occur
in
the
event
of
a
termination,
what
sort
of
severance
pay
and
things
of
that
sort
would
be
provided?
but
we
never
got
to
first
base
on
that
here.
but
the
logic
of
petitioner's
position
that
there
is
no
duty
to
bargain
at
all
over
the
decision
would
remove
from
the
mandatory
bargaining
obligation
even
the
situation
at
the
stage
of
contract
negotiations
where
the
parties
in
advance
of
such
a
situation
seek
to
make
provision
for
it.
the
duty
to
bargain
is
a
very,
very
flexible
concept.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
stay
in
business
if
you
want
to
go
completely
out
of
business.
i
think
the
darlington
case
recognizes
that.
if
an
employer
wants
to
pick
up--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
done
here
because
this
employer
remained
in
business.
he--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
he
remains
in
business
at
his
other
nursing
homes.
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
remain
in
business
here
if
the
money
items
could
be
worked
out.
mr.
norton
j.
come
after
bargaining,
however.
the
duty
to
bargain
does
not
mean
the
duty--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
am
suggesting
that.
i
am
also
suggesting
that
they
and
the
uaw
did.
mr.
norton
j.
come
where
the
considerations
are
of
the
nature
that
we
have
here,
if
it
is--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
i
want
to
just
make
one
point
and
that
is
that
everybody
concedes
here
that
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
about
the
effects
of
a
closing.
now,
the
effects
of
a
closing
are
often
intertwined
with
the
decision.
experience
has
shown,
and
the
authorities
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
that
enlightened
management
have
recognized
that
you
can't
meaningfully
bargain
about
the
effects
if
the
employees
are
going
to
have
suspicions
and
recriminations
about
the
decision.
the
only
way
you
can
get
on
to
meaningful
bargaining
about
the
effects
is
to
candidly
discuss
the
reasons
for
the
closings
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
a...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say,
just
a
presumption.
it
said--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
the
employer
would
have
to
show--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
but
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
was
that
bargaining
would
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
i
agree
with
you.
and
if
he
doesn't
like
unions,
certainly
bargaining
isn't
going
to
effectuate
much.
well,
it
may
be
that
bargaining
would
not
be
very
meaningful.
but
on
the
other
hand,
petitioner's
position--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
i'm
talking
about
a
situation
where
he
goes
completely
out
of
business,
which
is
the
darlington
situation,
for
an
anti-union
reason.
and
the
court
there
found
that
it
is
no
8(a)(3)
unless
you
can
show
a
purpose
to
chill.
the
board
in
that
sort
of
a
situation
has
indicated
that
it
would
find
no
duty
to
bargain
either.
but
the
situation
of
a
partial
closing
where
he
remains
in
business,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
i
submit,
presents
a
different
questions.
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
thank
you.
