mr.
come,
why
is
it
poles
apart?
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case...
maybe
the
man
is
a
little
older,
but
still,
on
the
economic
decision,
he'd
rather
spend
his
money
in
florida
than
where
he
was.
and
here
the
man
decides
he
doesn't
want
to
spend
his
operation
in
this
particular
location.
justice
stevens
mr.
pollack,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
mr.
come's
argument
raised
with
me?
if
you're
correct
in
your
view
that
this
is
not
a
mandatory
subject,
the
decision
to
close
is
not,
what
would
your
view
be
about
a
request
by
the
union,
when
you
sit
down
to
bargain
out
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
they
say,
we
would
now
like
to
bargain
about
the
procedure
to
be
out
in
the
contract
that
shall
be
followed
in
the
event
that
the
employer
faces
up
to
a
termination
decision.
would
that
be
mandatory
or
not?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
my
question
is,
we
want
to
bargain
with
you,
we
want
to
have
notice
of
any
intent
to
close
and
a
time
to
try
and
tell
you
how
we
might
help
you
make
a
different
decision?
justice
stevens
no,
let's
say
there's
a
fact
situation
just
like
this,
where--
