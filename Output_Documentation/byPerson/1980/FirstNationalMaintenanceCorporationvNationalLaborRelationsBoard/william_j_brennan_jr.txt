justice
jr.
what
happened
to
the
employees
when
the
employer
withdrew?
justice
jr.
but
they
were
not
in
fact
hired
in
one
of
the
other
three
facilities?
justice
jr.
was
there
a
successor
employer
here?
justice
jr.
someone
to
do
that
job?
justice
jr.
was
there
any
claim
of
the
employees
that
they
were
entitled
to?
justice
jr.
no,
but
what
was
the
result
of
that
bargaining?
justice
jr.
well,
no,
wouldn't
it
go
beyond
that?
i
mean,
if
there's
a
successor
employer,
don't
the
employees
have
a
demand
upon
him
under
those
particular
facts?
justice
jr.
there's
been
much
in
the
newspapers
about
ford
and
chrysler
and
others
completely
shutting
down
plants
and
letting
go
some
several
thousands
of
employees.
in
those
instances,
i
suppose,
there,
there
is
bargaining
on
effects
and
consequences,
but
there
hasn't
been
any
that
i've
read
about,
over
whether
or
not
they
could
close
down
those
plants,
has
there?
justice
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about...
what
i've
been
reading
is,
in
mahwah,
new
jersey,
for
example,
ford
has
completely
cut
out
a
plant,
stopped
operating
it
entirely.
laid
off
some
four
or
five
thousand
workers.
that's
the
sort
of
thing
i'm
talking
about.
justice
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
come,
has
the
board
taken
the
position...
for
example,
it's
a
single
plant,
and
it's
organized,
and
the
employer
just
has
such
a
hassle
constantly
with
the
union
that
he
says,
it's
not
worth
it,
i'm
going
to
give
up
and
go
move
to
florida,
and
i'm
going
to
get
out
of
business.
and
i'm...
why?
i'm
getting
out
of
business
because
this
union
is
just
giving
me
too
much
trouble.
i
want
no
part
of
them
anymore
and
i'm
just
getting
out
of
business.
does
the
board
think
that's
a
situation
in
which
the
employer
before
he
goes
out
of
business
must
negotiate
the
closing
with
the
union?
justice
jr.
do
you
mean
something
like
this,
mr.
come?
the
union
might
come
in
and
say,
look,
you
need
to
net
$500
a
week.
if
the
35
of
us
took
a
$3
decrease
in
our
weekly
pay,
that
would
give
you
enough,
coupled
with
the
$250
you've
got,
to
give
you
the
$500.
justice
jr.
but
what
about
the
situation--
justice
jr.
--well,
i
was
going
to
ask,
what
about
the...
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
the
facts,
but
didn't
ford
cut,
close
down,
permanently
close
down
its
mahwah
plant
and
let
some
4,000
employees
go?
justice
jr.
now,
was
there
any
negotiation
with
ford
about
the
closure
of
that
plant?
justice
jr.
anyway,
mr.
come,
even
if
the
nursing
home
took
the
position
that
$250
is
our
rock
bottom
dollar,
we're
not
going
to
contribute
any
more,
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
them
in
the
negotiation
if
you
could
get
the
union
to
agree
to
reduce
their
wages
enough
to
make
up
the
additional
$250,
would
it?
justice
jr.
what
you
mean,
mr.
come,
if
the
union
can
contribute
anything
which
would
lead
the
employer
not
to
close
the
plant,
then
he
ought
to
sit
down
with
the
union
and
negotiate.
not
that
he
ought
to;
that
he
must,
under
the
law,
it's
mandatory.
justice
jr.
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier,
mr.
come,
in
precisely...
i
gave
you
that
hypothetical.
and
i
thought
you
said
to
me
in
that
circumstance
you
didn't
think
there
was
any
duty
to
bargain.
exactly.
that's
what
i
thought
so,
too.
justice
jr.
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
if
the
union
were
to
agree
to
take
a
cut
in
wages
in
order
to
let
your
client
realize
$500
a
week,
why
would
that
trigger
the
reimbursement,
new
york
reimbursement
statute?
