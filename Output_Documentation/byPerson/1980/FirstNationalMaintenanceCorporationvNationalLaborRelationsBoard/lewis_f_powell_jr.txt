justice
jr.
mr.
come,
does
it
make
any
difference
that
in
this
case
the
nursing
home
had
agreed
to
pay
all
of
the
labor
cost
and
was
obligated
to
do
so?
justice
jr.
that
was
not
the
case,
of
course,
in
the
examples
you've
cited.
justice
jr.
is
that
demonstrated
by
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
jr.
would
not
the
nursing
home
also
have
to
participate
in
the
bargaining?
wouldn't
you
have
to
have
a
three-way
bargaining
under
those
circumstances?
suppose
the
nursing
home
just
said,
we
can't
afford
to
pay
more
than
$250
regardless
of
what
the
wages
are?
justice
jr.
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
what
the
nursing
home
would
be
willing
to
do?
