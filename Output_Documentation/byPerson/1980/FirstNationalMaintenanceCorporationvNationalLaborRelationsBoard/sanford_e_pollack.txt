mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
the
privilege
of
representing
first
national
maintenance
corporation
in
an
appeal
which
comes
to
you
from
the
second
circuit
court.
the
question
presented
for
your
determination
is
whether
an
employer's
unilateral
decision
to
terminate
a
losing
portion
of
its
operation
solely
for
legitimate
business
reasons
breaches
the
duty
to
bargain
under
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
we
are
not
dealing
with
anti-union
motivation.
no
animus
is
present.
nor
are
we
dealing
with
what
has
been
stipulated
and
accepted
as
the
mandatory
nature
of
effects
bargaining.
nor
are
we
dealing--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--effects
bargaining,
your
honor.
nor
are
we
dealing
with
subjects
which
may
be
unlawful
under
the
borg-warner
concept.
stated
another
way,
therefore,
your
honor,
we
are
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
terminating
a
losing
portion
of
its
business
for
a
legitimate
business
reason
is
either
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
within
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
a
permissive
subject
of
bargaining
within
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
no,
your
honor.
as
the
record
indicates
depending
upon
the
time
that
you
look
at
it,
during
the
critical
period
the
petitioner
operated
either
two
or
four
facilities.
we
had
some
17
months
covered
by
the
entire
period
of
operation
in
the
particular
facility
which
is
affected.
thirty-five
employees
were
employed
in
the
greenpark
facility
which
is
the
particular
facility
in
which
operations
were
terminated.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
no,
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
show
that.
the
record
does,
however,
show
that
there
was
no
interchange
between
the
various
facilities
serviced
by
first
national.
first
national,
as
your
honors,
i'm
sure,
are
aware,
was
a
service
corporation
which
did
cleaning
and
maintenance
work
in
nursing
homes
and
old
age
homes
within
the
city
of
new
york.
we
have
been
fortunate
in
that
we
have
had
the
benefit
of
two
supreme
court
decisions
in
this
area,
one
entitled
fibreboard,
wherein
the
supreme
court
had
the
opportunity
of
affirming
a
decision
of
mr.
chief
justice
burger
who
was
then
sitting
in
the
circuit
court,
and
in
which
mr.
justice
stevens
wrote
a
concurring
opinion.
thereafter,
about
one
year
later,
this
court
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
case
in
darlington.
darlington
concerned
a
partial
secession
of
operations
and
it
arose
under
section
3
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
not
under
section
12.
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
stated
that
as
we
view
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
fibreboard
through
its
rationale
in
darlington
as
interpreted
by
the
majority
of
the
circuits,
and
even,
i
might
suggest,
by
the
two
circuits
who
came
to
different
conclusions
and
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
comes
to
a
different
conclusion
at
face,
what
seems
to
me
to
be
apparent,
that
there
evolves
a
concept
of
law
which
is
really
what
i
would
suggest
is
the
status
of
the
law
today.
and
that
is
to
require
an
employer
to
bargain
about
the
matter
which
is
within
his
entrepreneurial
control
would
be
in
the
permissive
area
as
opposed
to
mandatory.
when
there
are
replacements
performing
the
affected
work
as
part
of
an
integrated
work
process
who
are
still
controlled
by
the
original
employer,
then
a
change
in
that
original
work
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
i
believe
that
when
fibreboard
talked
about
subcontracting
and
subcontracting
in
terms
of
the
employer
still
exercising
control,
and
all
that
the
employer
did
in
fibreboard
was
to
replace
one
group
of
employees
with
another
group
of
employees,
that's
what
was
meant:
an
employer
replacing
employees
performing
the
affected
work
as
part
of
the
integrated
work
process,
who
are
still
controlled
by
the
employer.
and
fibreboard
correctly
stated
that
that
subject
would
have
been
mandatory.
however,
if
there
is
a
secession
of
the
work
and
there
are
no
longer
replacements
performing
that
work,
or
if
on
the
other
hand
as
in
darlington
the
employer
withdraws
himself
as
an
employer
of
the
affected
work,
then
in
those
instances
i
would
submit
the
cases
almost
uniformly
hold
that
the
bargaining
would
then
be
permissive.
the
hard
cases,
your
honors,
where
the
courts
very
often
look
to
the
possibility
of
taint
of
union
animus,
are
really
cases
where
the
court
is
trying
in
my
opinion
to
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
subterfuge,
whether
the
employer
is
still
becoming
the
employer,
whether
the
work
is
really
still
being
done
by
an
ally
or
where
there
is
really
a
continuation
of
the
same
employment
relationship
but
with
different
employees.
that
is
not
the
case
which
is
before
you.
as
i
stated,
the
petitioner
services
at
best
four
facilities
in
the
new
york
area.
it
goes
into
those
facilities
with
its
own
employees,
it
cleans
the
facilities,
it
receives
as
compensation
from
the
nursing
home
a
weekly
sum
which
is
the
equivalent
of
its
out-of-pocket
expenses
for
the
payment
of
its
own
employees
plus
a
management
fee.
in
this
case
the
management
fee
should
have
been
$500
by
agreement
at
the
beginning
of
the
arrangement
with
greenpark.
it
was
$250
when
the
petitioner
requested
greenpark
to
replace
it
to
the
$500.
greenpark
refused
and
the
petitioner
ceased
operations.
it
left,
it
terminated
its
relationship
as
an
employer
performing
that
service,
or,
in
the
case
of
general
motors,
of
producing
the
item.
so
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
when
there
is
a
true
partial,
or
a
true
total
closing...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
your
honor,
as
part
of
the
effects
bargaining,
there
were
negotiations
and
the
employees
were
ultimately
granted
severance
pay.
and
although
i
don't
know
that
it's
part
of
this
record,
there
was
talk
at
least
of
preferential
hire
into
the
other
facilities.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
your
honor,
it
is
not
part
of
this
record
because
the
effects
bargaining
was
stipulated
to
at
the
lower
level
and
it
was
acceded
by
all
parties
that
there
should
and
is
mandatory
bargaining
on
the
effects,
clearly.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
we
should
be
looking
to
the
policy
of
the
act.
the
policy
of
the
act,
as
you
know,
is
set
forth
in
the
act
itself.
it
talks
in
terms
of
its
policy.
and
it
says,
in
effect,
that
there
is
a
desire
to
have
collective
bargaining,
and
that
the
parties
should
recognize
under
law
each
of
others,
one
another's
legitimate
rights.
the
legitimate
right
of
an
employee,
i
submit,
is
to
look
to
the
work
which
he
has
traditionally
been
doing
for
an
employer
and
say,
mr.
employer,
if
you
continue
to
do
this
work,
if
you
continue
to
be
an
employer
who
has
control
of
this
work,
then
i
have
a
legitimate
right
to
want
to
continue
to
do
it.
if
you
want
to
take
that
legitimate
right
away
from
me,
then
at
least
talk
to
me
about
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
legitimate
right
of
an
employer
is
to
say,
like
an
employee
can
say,
i
quit.
i
don't
want
to
work
anymore.
an
employee
has
a
right
to
quit.
an
employer
has
a
right
to
withdraw
himself
as
an
employer.
now
that
does
not
mean,
your
honors,
that
he
has
to
withdraw
himself
as
a
total
employer
in
every
single
facet
of
a
multi-faceted
operation.
it's
only
as
an
employer
who
produces
a
particular
affected
item
so
that,
as
in
first
national--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
yes,
sir,
there--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--they
did
in
fact,
as
the
record
shows,
make
a
claim
on
the
successor.
the
successor
was
the
nursing
home
who
took
the
operation
over
by
itself
and
the
employees
did
in
fact
make
a
claim
on
that
nursing
home.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
well,
in
that,
that
they
had
a
contract
which
put
the
old
employer
into
the
business
as
the
nursing
home
subcontractor;
there
was
that
kind
of
privity,
but
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
is
an
alter
ego
concept
as
between
first
national
and
greenpark
or
an
unlawful
successorship.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
nothing,
your
honor;
nothing.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
that
was
the
end
of
their
relationship.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
at
this
point
there
is
no
privity;
that
is
certainly
correct.
it's
been
held
by
many,
many
of
the
circuits
that
employees
have
a
right
to
quit
a
job
even
where
an
employee
cannot
strike.
employees
en
masse
have
a
right
to
quit.
so
too
does
an
employer
in
recognition
of
the
entrepreneurial,
core
of
entrepreneurial
control
doctrine,
have
a
right
to
say
he
does
not
wish
to
make
that
kind
of
product.
if
he
totally
excludes
himself
from
making
the
product,
i
suggest
that
the
dangers
inherent
in
calling
this
subject
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
would
require
that
he
not
be
forced
into
that
dilemma.
once
a
subject
is
called
mandatory,
it
brings
into
play
disclosure
of
all
relevant
facts
during
the
bargaining
process,
it
brings
into
fact
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
desire
to
terminate
to
the
world
at
large.
that
includes
the
employer's
suppliers,
the
employer's
creditors,
key
personnel
of
the
employer,
potential
and
possible
purchasers
of
the
business,
all
of
which,
your
honors,
works
to
the
detriment
of
the
employer's
legitimate
rights.
in
a
free
enterprise
society,
as
the
majority,
as
the
fibreboard
decision
recognized,
even
in
the
majority
opinion
as
compared
to
the
concurring
opinion,
there
is
an
inherent
management
freedom.
the
concurring
opinion
called
it
the
core
of
entrepreneurial
control.
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
ozark
trailers
case,
which
really
is
probably
the
single
most
important
case
from
the
national
labor
relations
board,
since
it
sets
the
framework
within
that
board's
functions
in
this
area,
even
there
they
recognized
that
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
partial
closings
they
have
to
deal
with
the
direct
effects
of
the
decision.
i
suggest
that
the
direct
effect
is
not
an
incidental
effect
of
a
decision
to
terminate
the
management's
desire
to
stay
in
business.
it
is
indirect
to
the
determination
made
by
management
in
the
core
of
his
entrepreneurial
control,
to
terminate.
true,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
that
that
decision
does
affect
working
conditions,
but
it
affects
them
indirectly.
it
affects
them
incidentally.
the
subject
is
not
whether
the
employer
should
terminate,
but
what
the
effects
of
that
termination
should
be.
the
desire
of
the
respondent
to
deem
all
areas
of
partial
closing
almost
on
a
per
se
basis
as
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining,
really
is
a
way
of
saying
that
they
need
to
hold
a
plant
hostage
in
order
to
have
efficient,
effective,
effects
bargaining.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
that's
extremely
true,
your
honor,
very
much
so,
and
i
think
that's
in
line
with
fibreboard
and
darlington.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
indeed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
in
fact,
we
admit
we
have
to
bargain
over
the
consequences.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
yes,
your
honor,
that
has
been
done.
it
is
really
not
the
issue
which
is
before
your
honors,
which--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--there
was
severance
pay
paid
to
the
employees.
there
was
some...
the
employees
had
some
17
months,
at
most,
of
accumulated
seniority,
and
so
there
was
some
severance
pay
and
there
was
discussion...
although
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
record,
because
it
happens
after
the
record,
your
honor...
there
was
discussion
about
preferential
hiring
in
the
other
facilities.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
no,
your
honor,
because
the
discussion
concerned
itself
with
preferential
hiring
in
other
facilities
operated
by
the
petitioner
herein.
and
the
other--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--not
necessarily.
it's
only
if
the
effects
bargaining
was
to
go
to
the
area
of
continued
employment
in
the
same
relationship.
the
privity
of
contract--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--i
think
that
other...
oh,
indeed,
your
honor.
there
are
other
sections
of
the
labor
law
which
clearly
show
that
in
a
true
successorship
there
is
an
entitlement
of
employees
to
stay
in
employment.
certainly--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--oh,
indeed,
your
honor.
i
was
addressing
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
bargaining
as
opposed
to--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--your
honor,
there
are...
if
i
may,
we
must
be
careful
not
to
read
into
this
problem
a
problem
of
normal
layoffs.
as
you
know--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--yes.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
if
ford
doesn't
subcontract
out
that
work
to
somebody
else
to
do
that
ford
would
have
the
right
to
unilaterally
make
that
decision.
that's
necessary.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
because
of
that
set
of
circumstances
the
employer
still
remains
the
employer.
the
work
is
being
done
by
a
replacement
group.
now,
that's
really
what
fibreboard
said.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
well,
there
is,
of
course,
your
honor,
a
very
vast
geographic
difference.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
fibreboard
was
really
a
subcontractor
suing--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
yes,
but
the
question,
your
honor,
is
whether
or
not
it
would
be
permissive
bargaining
or
mandatory.
because
once
it
becomes
mandatory
we
now
get
into
the
whole
concept
of
good
faith
bargaining
and
it
is
that,
i
suggest
to
you,
that
an
employer
who
really
is
going
to
stop
being
an
employer
does
not
have
to
become
involved
in.
just
as
an
employee
has
a
right
to
quit
without
good-faith
bargaining
on
that
subject
matter,
so--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--no,
your
honor,
because...
i
appreciate
that
if
you
just
accept
what
i
say
at
its
surface,
it
may
appear
that
it's
against
my
position,
but
it
is
not
against
my
position.
there
can
be
situations
where
an
employer
decides
that
he
wants
to
cut
his
labor
costs
as
in
fibreboard,
and
brings
the
union
in
and
says
to
the
union,
if
you
don't
cut
your
costs,
i
am
going
to
subcontract
out
that
maintenance
work
or
that
work
of
making
tops
of
convertible
cars.
at
that
point
the
union
can
validly
in
behalf
of
its
members
agree
to
increase
productivity
to
reduce--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--surely.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
i
think,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
word
"valid"
is
whether
there's
a
valid
termination
of
employment,
meaning
the
employer
validly
goes
out
of
business.
he
doesn't
run
away
and
open
up
a
plant
in
another
state
in
order
to
avoid
some
sort
of
union
problem,
or
he
doesn't
hire
a
subcontractor
in
his
own
plant.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
well,
it
wouldn't
even
matter
whether...
it
would
include
anti-union
animus,
motive,
but
it
would
not
only
be
limited
to
that.
it
could
be
a
good
business
decision
where
he
wants
to
save
some
money,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
he
wants
to
save
some
money
and
if
he
wants
to
stay
an
employer
and
he
really
just
wants
to
replace
his
labor
costs,
that
at
that
point
of
time
he
should
be
dealing
with
his
employees.
now,
it's
true
he
doesn't
give
up
his
rights
to
make
the
ultimate
decision
to
close.
he
still
reserves
the
prerogative
to
close.
i
agree
that
he
has
the
right,
however,
if
he
is
going
to
only
do
what
was
done
in
fibreboard,
subcontract
the
work
to
another
labor
force,
and
under
those
circumstances
he
should
bargain.
"bargain",
as
has
been
said
many,
many
times,
does
not
give
up
the
right
to
make
the
ultimate
decision.
it
just
means
to
listen.
i
believe
he
does
not
have
the
mandatory
bargaining
obligation
if
he
genuinely
intends
or
is
forced
to
cease
being
an
employer.
therefore,
if
his
supply
of
raw
materials
ends,
he
has
the
right
to
do
it
unilaterally.
if
his
major
customer
says,
no
more
business
and
he's
forced
out
of
business,
he
has
the
right
to
do
that.
if
he's
just
tired
of
shuttling
back
between
two
various
places,
plants,
and
he
genuinely
intends
to
close
and
does
close
one
plant
without
surreptitiously
moving
the
work
to
the
other
plant,
he
has
the
right
to
do
that.
that
right
does
not
preclude
permissive
bargaining.
permissive
bargaining
says,
i'll
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say;
maybe
i
don't
even
want
to
listen;
if
i
don't
want
to
listen,
i
don't
have
to
listen.
but
i
may
want
to
talk
to
you.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
that
is
absolutely
correct.
your
honor,
i
have
reserved
certain
time
for
rebuttal.
i'd
like
to
continue
that
reservation.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
yes.
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may
just
for
the
record
possibly
correct
what
may
be
some
confusion
concerning
the
costs
which
were
applicable
under
the
contract
between
first
national
and
the
nursing
home,
as
i
said
earlier,
this
was
a
cost-plus
contract
which
meant
any
give-back
of
costs
by
way
of
the
laborers,
the
union,
the
employee
saying,
i
would
be
willing
to
take
less
pay,
would
in
reality
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
nursing
home.
now,
it
might
be
argued,
and
i
suggest,
your
honors...
and
forgive
me,
we're
probably
off
the
record,
because
the
record
didn't
get
into
this,
but
in
response
to
the
question
i
would
like
to.
in
the
nursing
home
industry
in
the
state
of
new
york
we
are
dealing
with
predominantly
a
reimbursement
state
statute
concept
under
medicare
and
medicaid.
the
probability
is
that
if
there
were
a
cost
saving
in
labor,
that
the
state
reimbursement
to
the
nursing
home
would
be
proportionately
reduced
and
so
the
reason
why,
i
might
suggest,
the
respondent
is
willing
accept
the
2nd
circuit's
presumption
that
they
labeled
rebuttable,
is
because
in
reality
it's
not.
in
this
very
case
it
should
have
been
rebutted.
the
dissent
from
it
points
that
out
admirably
well.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
because
the
contract
between
greenpark,
which
was
the
nursing
home,
and
first
national,
says
that
the
nursing
home
repays
the
out-of-pocket
expenses
of
first
national
plus
a
management
fee.
so,
if
you
lower
the
out-of-pocket
expenses
it
doesn't
help
first
national.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
a
critical
point
that
the
dissent
in
the
circuit
below
makes
and
in
reality
is
why
the
presumption
is
really
not
a
rebuttable
presumption.
it's
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
because,
what
happened
in
this
very
case
is
the
dilemma
that
the
management
community
would
be
faced
with.
it
would
be
faced
with
bargaining
or
making
a
decision
to
bargain
or
not.
and
then,
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
a
court
or
a
board
would
after
the
fact
look
at
the
case
and
say,
oh,
you
should
have
bargained.
and
the
record
itself
might
not
really
be
complete.
and
so
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
ozark
rule,
the
presumption
of
the
the
3rd
circuit
in
brockway,
the
presumption
of
the
2nd
circuit
in
first
national,
all
become
unworkable.
better
is
it
to
apply
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
stewart
in
fibreboard.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
or
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
that
very
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
i
have
difficulty,
your
honors.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
your
honor,
clearly
that
would
be
in
my
opinion
permissive.
however,
if
the
procedure
were
a
procedure
which...
wide
as
it...
which
kept
at
its
core
the
effects
aspect
of
bargaining,
meaning
we
want
to
bargain
with
you
concerning
the
effects
of--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
notice
requirement
goes
to
effects
as
well
as
it
does
to
decisional
bargaining,
and
would
be
proper
and
mandatory.
i
submit
that
under
the
reasoning
which
i
advance,
the
request
in
advance
would
be
permissive
or
mandatory
only
if
it
were
distinguished
as
between
a
termination
and/or
a
continuation
of
the
business
in
a
different
nature
or
subject.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
it
would
be
permissive,
your
honor,
and
would
certainly
be
bargainable,
but
it's
not
the
kind
of
subject
that
parties
can
raise
to
the
stature
of
impact.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
your
honor,
the
railway
telegraphers
case
in
my
view
really
concerned
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
its
application
in
labor
disputes
as--
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
--no,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
the
court
said
it
was
a
legal
subject
for
bargaining
and
therefore
it
was
not
enjoinable.
i
don't
believe,
and
i
must
respectfully
suggest,
that
that
court
was
aware
or
even
dealt
with...
this
court...
even
dealt
with
the
borg-warner
tripartite
approach
to
legal,
mandatory
and
permissive.
the
court
in
telegraph
dealt
with
legal
and
illegal.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
sanford
e.
pollack
if
you
disagree
with
me,
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
the
way
this
court
treated
fibreboard
and
darlington
indicates
very
clearly
that
they
considered
telegraphers
in
line
with
what
i
have
described,
my
belief
of
the
case's
holding.
it
seems
to
me
incompatible
to
say,
by
the
labor
board,
that
the
labor
board
would
not
require
an
employer
to
bargain
about
his
decision
to
go
totally
out
of
business
and
move
to
florida,
but
would
require
that
employer
to
bargain
about
a
decision
to
close
his
new
york
plant
and
continue
in
a
florida
plant
that
he
may
have
operated
before
that
time.
to
me
it
is
incongruous.
it
defies
both
the
treatment
that
this
court
has
afforded
to
the
doctrines
of
law
and,
i
suggest,
logic.
thank
you.
