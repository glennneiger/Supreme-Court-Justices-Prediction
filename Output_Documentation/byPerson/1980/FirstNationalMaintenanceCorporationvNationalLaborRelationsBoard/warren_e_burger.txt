chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
first
national
maintenance
corporation
v.
the
labor
board.
mr.
pollack,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
was
there
any
privity
between
the
new
employer
and
the
old?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
get
at
it
more
directly.
chief
justice
burger
did
first
national
have
anything
to
do
with
the
nursing
home
after
they
terminated?
chief
justice
burger
then
there
was
no
privity.
chief
justice
burger
then
there
is
no
privity?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
saying
that
if
ford
simultaneously
opened
a
new
plant
in
hamburg,
germany,
employing
substantially
the
same
number
of
people,
that
that
would
be
a
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining?
chief
justice
burger
now,
they
might
be
able
to
show
in
that
bargaining
valid
reasons,
and
there'd
be
no
problem;
the
problem
would
wash
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
come.
chief
justice
burger
since
you
emphasize
the
two
days,
what
if
they
had
given
them
30
days
notice,
as
soon
as
they
terminated
with
the
nursing
home?
would
that
make
it
different?
chief
justice
burger
let
me
give
you
a
slight
variation
of
that.
suppose,
on
the
first
of
that
month,
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
says
to
his
wife,
i
am
80
years
old
this
month
and
let's
move
to
florida,
and
just
go
out
of
business.
have
you
got
to
bargain
that
question
with
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
counsel.
0
[recess.]
mr.
come,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
burger
did
the
contract
contain
any
provision
calling
for
consultation
or
notice,
independent
of
any
other
factors
here?
chief
justice
burger
where
is
the
obligation
to
stay
in
business?
whence
does
that
arise?
in
any
business,
whether
it's
chrysler,
or
first
national
maintenance?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
what
was
done
here?
chief
justice
burger
not
in
this
business.
not
in
the
particular
enterprise
that
we're
concerned
with
on
this
record.
chief
justice
burger
well,
but
chrysler
is
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
remain
in
business,
but
they
certainly
can
close
some
of
their
plants
which
are
nonproductive
in
order
to
survive.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
suggest
that
chrysler
had
to
bargain
with
somebody
before
they
closed
a
plant
somewhere?
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
fact
that
they
did
doesn't
necessarily,
they
may
have
done
that
in
terms
of
future
relations
with
the
united
automobile
workers
because
they've
got
to
continue
to
work
together,
but
are
you
saying
there's
an
obligation
if
they
decide
that
a
losing
plant
must
be
closed,
an
obligation
to
negotiate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
pollack?
chief
justice
burger
well,
it's
a
court
of
appeals
opinion--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
