justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
effectively
arguing
for
the
position
that
judge
kearse
took
in
her
dissent
in
the
2nd
circuit.
justice
rehnquist
that
you
have
to...
may
have
to
bargain
over
the
consequences
of
the
closing
but
that
you
don't
have
to
bargain
over
whether
or
not
you'd
close?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
a
sense,
the
word
"valid
reasons"
at
the
bargaining
table
doesn't
have
too
much
significance,
does
it?
it's
more
arguments
back
and
forth
rather
than
saying
one
argument
is
valid
and
another
isn't?
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say,
validly,
i
mean,
it
can
agree,
period,
can
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
why
does
the
word
"valid"
creep
in?
justice
rehnquist
so
"valid"
means
without
anti-union
animus,
or?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
come?
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
that
statement
you
just
made
require
this
court
to
at
least
disapprove
the
8th
circuit's
decision
in
the
burns
case,
as
to
the
omaha
operation?
justice
rehnquist
when
you're
talking
about
bargaining,
you're
talking
about
bargaining
between
the
employer
and
the
union,
are
you
not?
justice
rehnquist
so
when
you
say
that
there
is
little
or
nothing
that
the
union
could
contribute
to
the
bargaining
process,
you're
talking
about
a
discussion
between
the
employer
and
somebody
else
besides
the
union?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
come,
what
if
a
40-year-old
couple
who
are
proprietors
decide
that
they're
sick
and
tired
of
shoveling
snow
up
here
in
the
north
and
want
to
move
to
florida?
do
you
think
the
board
would
say
that
was
a
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
union
could
point
it
out
to
him
by
sending
him
a
letter,
couldn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
suggesting
that
the
union
is
kind
of
a
management
consultant
that
can
help
him
save
money.
justice
rehnquist
--well,
does
the
board
recognize
any
exception
to
its
ozark
rule?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
come,
what
precisely
was
the
factual
sequence
here?
did
the
company
simply
announce
without
any
previous
notice
to
the
union
at
all
that
it
was
shutting
down
this
operation?
justice
rehnquist
but
does
a
duty
to
bargain
under
the
act
supply
a
contractual
term
that
is
nonexistent?
justice
rehnquist
but
you're
making
the
duty
to
bargain
in
effect
a
part
of
a
contractual
provision
that
was
nonexistent.
