justice

and
it
wouldn't
be
an
unfair
practice
under
(a)(3)
or
something?
justice
white
or
(a)
something.
justice
white
mr.
come,
perhaps
you
can't
answer
this
in
just
a
word
but
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
here
or
are
you
furthering
board's
view,
or
both?
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
sustain
the
board's
rule,
did
it?
justice
white
well,
it
sustained
on
the
judgment,
maybe,
but
the
board's
rule
is
more
of
a
per
se
rule
than
the
court
of
appeals
would
agree
to,
isn't
it?
justice
white
this
is
your
so-called
ozark
rule,
is
that
it?
justice
white
in
the
light
of
subsequent
elections.
i--
--i
will
put
it
to
you
this
way.
does
the
court
of
appeals
view
of
the
law
satisfy
the
board
completely?
justice
white
that's
all
i
really--
justice
white
mr.
come,
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
you
would
accept
the
court
of
appeals'
view
that
a
presumption
was
enough
to
satisfy
the
board.
now,
suppose
the
employer
comes
back
and
says,
look,
i
didn't
want
to
bargain
because
economics
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
i
just
didn't
like
the
union.
now,
in
this
very
case,
a
union
gets
certified,
suppose
the
employer
says,
i
decided
to
close
down
this
branch
because
i
just
don't
like
unions?
justice
white
it
said
that
the
employer...
that
there
was--
justice
white
--a
presumption
that
he
must
bargain.
except
that
the...
it's
rebuttable.
if
he's
got
the
right
reasons,
he
doesn't
need
to
bargain.
justice
white
--well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
telegraphers
case
in
the
railroad?
justice
white
well,
it
may
be,
but
the
court
said
it
was
a
mandatory
duty
of
bargaining.
justice
white
so
you
think...
my
real
question
was,
do
you
think
that
the
rule
might
be
different
in
the
railroad
labor
cases?
justice
white
so
if
we
happen
to
disagree
with
you
on
how
to
read
the
railway
telegraphers
case,
you
may
lose
your
case?
