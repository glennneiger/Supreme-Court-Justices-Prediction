stewart
mandatory
nature
of
what?
justice
stewart
well,
now,
wouldn't
the
new
employer
have
to
be
a
party
to
that
bargaining?
justice
stewart
oh.
and
often
the
successor
employer
would
have
to
be
a
party
to
the
effects
bargaining,
wouldn't
he?
justice
stewart
that's
our
burns
detective
and
other
cases.
justice
stewart
and
you
think
that
situation
as
hypothesized
by
the
chief
justice
is
similar
enough
to
fibreboard
to
have
the
fibreboard
rule
apply?
justice
stewart
but
was
that
the
basis
of
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice?
justice
stewart
well,

there's
mandatory
bargaining.

lose
your
case,
don't
you?
