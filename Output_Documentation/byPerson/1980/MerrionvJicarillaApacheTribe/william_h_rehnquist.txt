mr.
kellahin,
is
the
jicarilla
tribe
a
treaty
tribe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
not
within
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
until
the
mexican
cession?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
colville
dealt
with
a
treaty
tribe,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
commerce
clause
argument,
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
counsel,
i
take
it
that
would
apply
to
a
state
as
well
as
to
a
tribe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
haven't
severance
taxes
on
extraction
of
minerals
from
the
ground
long
been
a
source
of
income
for
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
quite
apart
from
indians?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
most
of
the
western
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you're
saying
that
in
effect
the
state
could
not
impose
this
tax
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authorization
is
that
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
must
rely
on
to
impose
a
tax
of?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
we're
not
talking
about
taxes
levied
by
states
that
are
not
on
indian
reservations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
398(c)
doesn't
purport
to
bear
on
the
simple
state-producer
relationship
independent
of
its
relationship
to
the
indians,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
had
no
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily,
the
state
doesn't
need
any
authority
from
congress
to
impose
a
severance
tax,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
answer
it,
whether
it's
present
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
repealer
ever
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
repealer
ever
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
draw
any
distinction
between
treaty
indian
reservations
and
executive
order
reservations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
nordhaus,
398(c)
itself
confines
itself
to
executive
order
reservations,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
398(c)
then
was
repealed
by
implication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
the
argument
that
congress
compromised,
in
effect,
and
said
the
indians
would
get
the
royalties
and
the
state
would
get
the
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
of
them
to
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
of
them
to
himself?
justice
rehnquist
but
this
court
has
in
recent
years
retreated
from
the
notion
that
indians
are
independent
sovereigns,
has
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
ever
been
in
rio
arriba
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
daresay
there
are
probably
more
jicarilla
indians
that
non-jicarilla
indians
in
the
county.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
393(c)
was
impliedly
repealed
by
later
indian
legislation
by
congress?
