these
cases
are
here
on
writs
for
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
that
court
held
that
the
respondent
indian
tribe
had
the
authority
to
impose
a
severance
tax
on
oil
and
gas
production
on
tribe
or
reservation
land.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
taxing
power
is
an
inherit
attribute
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
had
not
been
divested
by
any
treaty
or
act
of
congress
and
that
the
tax
did
not
violate
the
commerce
clause.
petitioners
have
long
time
leases
with
the
tribe
which
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
these
leases
authorized
them
to
extract
oil
and
natural
gas
deposits
on
reservation
land.
petitioners
argue
that
the
tribe's
power
to
post
a
tax
derives
solely
from
the
tribe's
power
to
exclude
non-indians
from
tribal
lands
and
that
the
tribe
waived
that
right
to
tax
petitioners'
mining
activities
when
it
entered
into
long
term
leases.
ultimately,
petitioners
argue
that
the
tribal
power
to
impose
the
severance
tax
on
mining
activities
had
been
divested
by
congress
through
various
federal
acts.
finally,
petitioners
assert
that
even
if
the
tribe
has
authority
to
impose
a
tax,
the
tax
violates
the
commerce
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reject
petitioner's
contentions
and
we
uphold
the
challenged
tribal
tax.
the
tribe
has
the
inherit
power
to
impose
the
tax
on
petitioners'
mining
activities
on
the
reservation.
and
this
taxing
authority
does
not
derive
solely
from
the
tribe's
power
to
exclude
non-indians
from
tribal
lands,
but
rather
from
the
tribe's
general
authority
and
sovereign
to
control
economic
activities
within
its
jurisdiction
and
to
defray
the
cost
of
providing
governmental
services.
furthermore,
even
if
the
tribe's
power
to
tax
derived
only
from
its
power
to
exclude,
the
tribe
did
not
waive
its
taxing
authority
by
entering
to
leases
with
petitioners.
tribal
taxing
power
whatever
its
source
is
a
sovereign
power
and
this
sovereign
power
remains
intact
unless
it
is
surrendered
in
clear
and
unmistakable
terms.
finally,
none
of
the
federal
legislations
cited
by
the
petitioners
deprive
the
tribe's
taxing
authority.
petitioners'
commerce
clause
argument
also
must
fail.
courts
act
as
final
arbitrators
under
the
commerce
clause
only
when
congress
has
not
acted.
here,
congress
has
affirmatively
acted
by
providing
a
series
of
federal
checkpoints
that
must
be
cleared
before
tribal
tax
can
take
effect.
both
the
tribal
--
constitution
that
announced
the
tribes'
intention
to
tax
non-members
and
the
ordinance
imposing
the
challenged
severance
tax
were
approved
by
the
secretary
pursuant
to
the
scheme.
in
any
event,
the
challenged
tax
would
survive
judicious
scrutiny
under
the
commerce
clause
if
such
scrutiny
were
necessary.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
thereby
affirmed.

dissenting
