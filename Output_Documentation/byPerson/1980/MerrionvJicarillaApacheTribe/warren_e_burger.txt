mr.
kellahin,
you
may
continue.
chief

e.

mr.
cooney.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
negotiated
the
lease,
could
the
tribe
have
written
in
the
provision
for
the
functional
equivalent
of
this
tax,
in
other
words,
call
it
whatever
you
want?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
say
they
didn't
call
it
a
tax.
i
didn't
make
my
question
very
clear.
they
called
it
something
else:
bonus,
profit-sharing...
they
could
have
written
any
provision
they
wanted
in
terms
of
dollars,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
suggesting
is,
the
tribe
is
trying
to
collect
a
royalty
and
these
other
factors
and
then
another
royalty
in
the
guise
or
the
form
of
the
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
jicarilla
tribe
taxed
all
the
oil
and
gas
extracted,
without
reference
to
where
it
was
going,
you
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
the
commerce
clause
case,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
grounds,
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
arguing
the
discrimination
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
a
question
about
the
breadth
of
the
power
of
the
tribe.
could
the
tribe
here
have
said
that
we're
going
to
extract
all
of
these
valuables
ourselves
and
so
we'll
make
a
contract
with
amoco
to
do
the
work,
and
could
they
then
in
your
view
write
any
ticket
they
wanted
in
an
arm's-length
negotiation?
and
it
might
amount
to
the
same
number
of
dollars
as
they're
getting
by
royalty
plus
tax
plus
other
things
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
just
like,
this
would
be
getting
the
same
amount
of
dollars
but
by
a
negotiated
contract?
chief
justice
burger
i
suppose
they
could
demand
a
90
percent
royalty
but
they
just
wouldn't...
no
one
would
contract
with
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
would
be
a
marketplace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
contract
require
the
approval
of
the
department
of
interior?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
nordhaus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
colville
case
did
not
involve
minerals
extracted
from
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--dealing
with
what
kind
of...
what
was
the
subject
of
the
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you're
saying
that
amoco,
the
lessee
should
have
known
under
colville
that
in
addition
to
paying
a
royalty
and
all
other
charges
they
were
going
to
be
subject
to
an
indian
tax
as
well?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
indian
government
in
negotiating
the
contract
could
certainly
have
taken
that
into
account
in
fixing
the
royalty,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--did
the
energy
crisis
have
something
to
do
with
this
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
economic
impact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
there
is
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
