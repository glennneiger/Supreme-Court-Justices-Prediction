mr.
john
r.
cooney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
no.
80-15.
our
argument
will
be
that
the
commerce
clause
will
not
permit
this
new
tribal
severance
tax
and
that
congress
in
1927
by
enacting
25
united
states
code
section
398(c)
preempted
any
power
of
the
tribe
to
impose
the
tax.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
negative
implications
of
the
commerce
clause
restrain
the
powers
of
indian
tribes
who
would
attempt
to
impose
the
powers
of
taxation
or
regulation
over
commerce
similar
to
those
currently
imposed
by
states
or
municipalities.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
severance
taxes
have
been,
and
particularly
with
reference
to
executive
order
indian
reservations
and
other
indian
reservations.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes.
new
mexico,
for
example,
has
imposed
severance
taxes.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
most
of
the
western
states.
our
commerce
clause
argument,
your
honor,
rests
not
so
much
on
the
fact
that
a
severance
tax
exists
but
that
this
jicarilla
severance
tax
is
discriminatory,
that
it
is
imposed
by
the
fashion
in
which
it
is
drafted
directly
upon
commerce,
and
that
it
imposes
in
addition
with
the
tax
imposed
by
the
state
a
multiple
burden
upon
commerce.
we
do
not
attack
the
validity
of
a
severance
tax
per
se,
but
simply
submit
that
the
jicarilla
tribe
may
not
impose
such
a
tax
in
this
case
because
congress
has
divested
that
power,
and
that
in
addition
when
added
to
the
state
tax
it
creates
a
multiple
burden.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
the
royalty
and
the
bonus
and
the
rental,
all
of
which
produce
considerable
income
to
the
tribe.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
it
may
take
its
royalty
in
kind,
it
may
elect
to
do
that;
or
it
may
take
the
money.
to
date
it
has
taken
the
money.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
mr.
chief
justice,
but
for
the
provisions
of
25
united
states
code
398(c),
which
we
say
divests
the
tribe
of
any
power
to
impose
a
tax
on
production,
they
could.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
any
provision
that
they
wanted
in
terms
of
dollars
that
would
be
acceptable
in
the
marketplace
to
a
potential
lessee
and
that
would
be
approvable
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
but
any
tax
that
is
imposed
on
the
production
or
on
the
assets
or
equipment
or
activities
of
the
lessee
would
be
preempted
by
section
398(c).
mr.
john
r.
cooney
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
exactly
what
the
tribe
is
attempting
here
to
do.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
it
discriminates
against
any
oil
and
gas
production
which
is
not
transported
or
sold
off
the
jicarilla
reservation.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
there
is
none
at
the
present.
there
is
the
announced
intention
of
the
tribe
to
use
gas
retained
on
the
reservation
for
industrial
and
agricultural
purposes.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
it
might
take
its--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--or
it
might
sell
that
gas
to
other
industries,
such
as
it
plans
to
do
on
the
reservation.
and
it
might
also
permit
producers
to
locate
on
the
reservation--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--none
at
the
present
time.
under
the
nipper
case,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
potential
for
discrimination
is
certainly
to
be
considered
by
the
court
in
passing
upon
the
merits
of
the
tax.
we
also
admit
quite
freely
that
the
tax
ordinance
here
could
be
amended
easily
to
apply
only
to
severance
of
all
oil
and
gas
which
is
produced
on
the
reservation--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--none
on
discrimination.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
as
it's
presently
drafted,
we
have
a
case
on
discrimination,
and
as
the
tax
is
presently
drafted
we
have
a
strong
case
on
the
tax
being
a
direct
tax
on
commerce
under
michigan,
wisconsin.
this
tax
is
not
a
tax
on
severance
of
the
oil
and
gas.
it
is
a
tax
only
on
transportation
or
sale
of
the
gas
off
the
reservation.
it
is
not
apportioned
according
to
the
length
of
the
pipeline
facilities
on
the
reservation
nor
to
the
volume
of
business
conducted
there.
and
under
the
precise
test
of
michigan,
wisconsin,
very
clearly
this
tax
taxes
directly
an
integral
portion
of
commerce
and
therefore
cannot
be
sustained.
but
that,
like
the
discrimination
problem,
can
be
amended
away
by
the
ordinance
being
amended
to
apply
only
to
the
severance
of
all
oil
and
gas
which
is
severed
on
the
reservation.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we're
saying
that
the
state
has
the
power
granted
by
congress
to
impose
the
tax
that
it
now
imposes,
which
applies
to
the
severance
of
all
oil
and
gas
within
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
not
just
to
oil
and
gas
within
the
state
of
new
mexico
that
is
then
transported
or
sold
off
the
state--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--your
honor,
the
state
might
have
that
authorization
absent
specific
congressional
authorization
but
by
the
1927
act,
25
united
states
code,
section
398(c),
the
states
specifically
were
granted
the
authority
to
tax
the
entire
production
of
oil
and
gas
on
executive
order
reservations,
including
even
the
indians'
royalty
share.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
we're
talking
about
here
the
validity
of
the
jicarilla
tax
that
is
levied
on
production
on
the
reservation
when
added
to
the
state
tax
that
is
also
imposed
on
the
severance
of
oil
and
gas
on
the
reservation.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
398(c)
by
its
express
terms
gives
the
states
the
power
to
tax
the
producer
on
the
reservation.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
legislation.
and
when
that
tax
is
added
to
the
jicarilla
tax
it
creates,
we
believe,
an
impermissible
multiple
burden.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
if
we
had
no
reservation
there
would
be
no
case
here
today,
because
there
would
only
be
one
tax.
there
would
be
a
state
tax
imposed
on
the
severance
of
oil
and
gas--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--yes,
it
would.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
that's
correct.
under
the
most
elementary
commerce
clause
analysis,
this
jicarilla
tax
ordinance
as
drafted
violates
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
that
brings
us
to
the
contention
of
the
jicarillas
and
the
solicitor
here
which
we
believe
somewhat
astounding,
that
the
negative
restraints
of
the
commerce
clause
do
not
apply
to
the
actions
of
tribes
when
they
seek
to
tax
or
regulate
commerce,
when
they
seek
to
tax
or
regulate
production
of
oil
and
gas
on
indian
reservations.
we
think
that
notion
is
rooted
in
19th
century
concepts
of
indian
tribes
as
separate
nations
wholly
removed
from
the
union
and
not
subject
to
the
restraints
which
curbed
the
powers
of
the
lesser
sovereigns,
the
states
and
the
municipalities
within
the
federal
system.
and
we
don't
think
that
these
assertions
can
be
accepted
by
this
court.
that
would
allow
287
tribal
governments,
we
submit,
to
hold
commerce
hostage
by
the
fortuitous
location
of
urgently
needed
energy
resources
under
their
reservations.
the
solicitor
tells
us
that
the
answer
to
this
problem
is
that
congress
may
act
to
curb
tribal
taxing
powers
if
congress
feels
they're
being
unjustly
exercised
or
place
a
burden
on
commerce.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
we
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
because
if
you
remove
the--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--the
discrimination
argument
would
not
apply.
the
direct
burden
on
commerce
under
michigan,
wisconsin
would
not
apply,
but
there
would
still
remain
a
multiple
burden.
the
state
would
tax,
unapportioned,
the
entire
volume,
and
does
tax
unapportioned
the
entire
volume
of
production
on
the
reservation,
and
the
jicarilla
claim
the
right
to
tax
unapportioned
the
entire
volume
of
production
on
the
reservation.
we
believe
that
that
kind
of
multiple
burden
is
impermissible
under
the
commerce
clause
and
has
been
precluded
by
congress
in
the
1927
act.
there
are
two
points
that
are
critical
to
this
issue.
the
first
is
that
the
tribe
and
the
state
are
not
hierarchical
sovereigns
attempting
to
tax
the
same
event.
one
cannot
control
the
taxing
policy
of
the
other
as
the
united
states
can
that
of
the
states
or
the
states
that
of
the
municipalities.
a
second
critical
point
here
is
that
a
severance
tax
on
oil
and
gas
production
impacts
the
amount
of
production.
a
tribal
severance
tax
makes
the
activity
of
production
on
the
reservation
more
expensive
than
it
is
off
the
reservation.
it
affects
the
ability
of
the
producers
to
produce
in
paying
quantities
and
it
renders
marginally
economic
wells
subject
to
early
abandonment,
as
found
by
the
district
court.
the
tribal
tax,
therefore,
implicates
the
state
tax
by
affecting
the
amount
of
production
on
the
reservation
against
which
the
congressionally
permitted
state
tax
is
assessed.
the
multiple
burden,
we
submit,
could
be
solved
only
in
one
of
two
fashions.
first,
by
determining
which
of
those
two
jurisdictions,
the
tribe
or
the
state,
has
the
better
claim
to
tax,
or
by
this
court
devising
some
as
yet
hitherto
unknown
method
of
applying
the
apportionment
test
to
such
taxation
of
concentric
sovereigns
both
of
whom
claim
that
the
entire
event,
the
entire
local
event,
as
it
were,
of
severance
takes
place
entirely
within
their
borders.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
your
honor,
ordinarily
i
don't
think
that
question
is
present
here.
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--i
don't
think
the
state
does
need
authority
to
impose
a
severance
tax
on
an
indian
reservation,
just
as
it
doesn't
need
specific
authority
to
impose
a
tax
on
other
activities
of
non-indians
on
the
reservations
unless
that
tax
interferes
with
rights
of
self-government
or
is
divested
by
congressional
action.
but
we
have
here
specific
congressional
grants
to
the
states
to
tax
this
production
without
any
apportionment
whatsoever.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1927
act
we
think
shows
quite
clearly
that
congress
intended
to
give
to
the
tribe
the
benefits
of
the
royalty,
the
bonus,
and
the
rental
income
from
leasing
for
oil
and
gas
these
executive
order
reservations,
but
to
give
to
the
states
the
right
to
tax
the
entire
production
of
the
oil
and
gas.
this
construction
of
the
1927
act
is
reinforced
by
congress's
own
agency,
the
american
indian
policy
review
commission,
which
in
1977
recommended
that
25
usc
section
398(c)
and
its
counterpart,
section
398,
be
repealed
for
the
specific
purpose
of
allowing
tribal
severance
taxation
of
production
on
reservations.
we
think
history
enforces
this
conclusion.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
pardon?
mr.
john
r.
cooney
it
was
never
enacted.
25
usc
section
398(c)
is
still
on
the
books,
still
allows
unapportioned
taxation
of
severance
by
states
on
executive
order
reservations,
and
we
think
thereby
precludes
the
tribal
severance
tax.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
to
address
the
question
of
severance
taxes
which
are
a
new
phenomena?
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
the
secretary
delegate
in
the
field
approved
the
tax
with
the
specific
proviso
that
there
would
be
consent
to
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
tax.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
apparently
so,
your
honor,
but
it
is
up
to
this
court
and
the
federal
judiciary--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--they
have
taken
that
position
which
reversed
a
50-year-long
position
that
states
could
tax
severance
of
minerals
on
indian
reservations
and
that
indians
did
not.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
your
honor,
there
is
evidence--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--no,
sir.
there
is
no--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--the
50-year
policy
was
to
permit
state
taxation
and
recognized
the
taxation--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
best
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
indian
severance
taxes
were
never
heard
of
or
thought
of
by
the
indian
tribes
until
the
late
'70s.
and
similarly,
in
the
montana
case,
last
week,
where
the
court
said
that
the
crows'
long
accommodation
to
game
and
fish
regulation
by
the
state
of
montana
on
that
reservation
foreclosed
any
contention
that
that
sort
of
tribal
regulation
was
essential
to
the
functioning
of
tribal
self-government.
we
think
it's
highly
dubious
that
the
jicarilla
self-government
suddenly
requires
in
the
midst
of
the
energy
crisis
this
new
tribal
severance
tax.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
your
honor,
but
for...
if
they
attempted
to
impose
a
tax,
we
think
it's
preempted
by
398(c).
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
your
honor,
as
to
new
contracts,
i
believe
they
could
instead
of
exacting
a
12-1/2
percent
royalty,
demand
a
20
percent
royalty
and
thereby
increase
the
take.
but
all
of
these--
mr.
john
r.
cooney
--that's
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
and
we
think
the
congress
intended
the
royalty
to
be
received
by
the
tribe
to
be
determined
by
the
marketplace,
by
the
auction
and
bidding
proposals,
and
approval
of
the
royalty
rate
set
forth
in
the
statute,
and
that
they
intended
the
rates
of
taxation
to
be
applied
by
the
states
to
that
production.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
cooney
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
we
think
the
significance
of
section
110
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
is
merely
in
recognizing
the
impact
of
severance
taxes
on
production,
and
that
if
those
severance
taxes
are
not
allowed
to
be
passed
through
production
is
impacted.
that's
precisely
our
point
of
the
impact
of
the
tribal
tax
on
the
state
severance
tax.
congress
specifically
left
the
question
of
validity
of
this
tribal
severance
tax
to
this
court.
there
is
no
record
to
support
mr.
nordhaus's
claims
concerning
the
cost
of
tribal
services
to
the
lessees.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
that
is
before
the
court
shows
that
the
royalty
revenue
to
the
tribe
more
than
supports
the
entire
tribal
government.
thirdly,
while
there
was
no
mention
of
tribal
severance
taxation
in
the
debates
preceding
the
'27
act,
likewise
there
was
no
mention
of
tribal
authority
over
purchasers
of
alienated
lands
in
the
allotment
acts
considered
by
this
court
in
the
montana
case
last
week.
but
we
think
just
as
that
authority
could
not
have
survived
the
allotment
acts,
likewise
tribal
severance
taxation
could
not
have
survived
the
1927
statute.
