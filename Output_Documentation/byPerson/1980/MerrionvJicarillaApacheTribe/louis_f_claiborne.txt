mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may
begin
at
the
end,
and
by
the
end
i
mean
last
week's
decision
in
the
montana
crow
tribe
case,
the
teaching
of
that
case,
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
the
territorial
sovereignty
of
indian
tribes
is
somewhat
more
limited
than
that
of
states,
that
indian
tribes
cannot
regulate
the
activities
of
non-indians
on
non-indian
land
when
there
is
no
involvement
of
indians
and
when
there
is
no
substantial
effect
on
vital
tribal
interests.
but
the
court
was
at
pains
to
point
out
that
on
the
other
hand,
so
much
is
left
of
the
inherent
sovereignty
of
indian
tribes
that
they
may
regulate
through
taxation
and
other
means
those
activities
of
non-indians
even
on
non-indian
land,
the
court
expressly
pointed
out,
when
there
is
a
relationship
with
the
indians
through
contract
or
commercial
dealings
or
in
other
ways;
or
when,
independently
of
such
consensual
dealings
between
indians
and
non-indians,
the
activity
of
the
non-indians
on
the
non-indian
land
substantially
affects
vital
tribal
interests.
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
squarely
falls
under
both
of
these
principles,
indicating
what
still
survives
of
indian
sovereignty.
here
we're
dealing
with
a
continuing
relationship
between
non-indians
and
the
tribe
itself,
leases
for
a
long
term,
and
operations
which
continue
over
a
long
term.
the
operations
take
place
on
tribal
lands.
the
activities
there
affect
that
land,
in
a
permanent
way,
as
well,
obviously,
as
surrounding
land
through
environmental
effects.
the
operations
are
conducted
under
leases
which
require,
and
which
in
practice
do
involve
a
local
work
force,
so
there
is
a
direct
involvement
of
tribal
members
with
the
operations
of
the
lessees.
the
operations
involve
the
use
of
tribal
roads
and
the
activities
of
the
lessees
implicate
tribal
services
not
only
for
the
maintenance
of
such
roads
but
also
police
and
fire
protection
and
all
the
other
benefits
of
an
established
government
within
the
reservation
within
which
these
activities
take
place.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
unaware
of
the
figures
with
respect
to
the
number
of
members
who
live
within
this
reservation,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only...
all
of
the
land,
as
i
appreciate
it,
within
the
jicarilla
reservation,
is
tribal--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--no,
but
it
does
indicate
a
very
important
fact
which
is
that
the
power
to
impose
the
taxes
which
were
mentioned
in
that
case
are
sovereign
powers
and
not
landowners'
powers
or
a
power
to
forbid
entry
or
to
condition
entry.
because
obviously...
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
but
i
take
it
it
was
a
considered
dictum
in
the
case.
it
very
plainly
holds
that
even
on
non-indian
land,
on
fee-owned
land,
there
in
proper
circumstances
is
the
tribal
power
of
taxation.
that
can
only
be
a
sovereign
power
since
by
definition
the
tribe
is
not
the
landlord
and
by
definition
the
tribe
cannot
prevent
access
to
a
man's
privately
owned
land
even
though
within
the
reservation.
any
power
of
taxation
with
respect
to
activities
there
must
be
a
sovereign
power.
being
a
sovereign
power
it
is
not
without
express
words
contracted
away
when
the
tribe,
who
happened
to
be
also
the
landlord
in
this
case,
makes
an
arrangement
with
the
lessees.
sovereigns
do
not
commonly
agree
that
they
will
waive
any
right
in
future
to
impose
regulations
or
taxes,
which
rights
they
hold
as
sovereigns,
even
though
they
have
contracted
for
a
specific
royalty
or
other
price
with
the
person
with
whom
they
deal.
and
that
principle
surely
is
applicable
here
to
the
jicarillas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
have
taken
no
position
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
1938
act
impliedly
repealed
the
state
power
to
tax
under
the
'27
act.
the
court
of
appeal
expressly
avoided
any
decision
on
that
issue
and
it
is
not
presented
to
this
court.
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
government
has
argued
for
implied
repeal
in
other
cases
in
other
courts
but
we
have
no
occasion
to
take
a
firm
position
on
that
matter
here.
we
certainly
do
not
rely
in
our
argument
today
on
any
implied
repeal
of
the
'27
act.
on
the
contrary,
we
concede
for
the
purposes
of
the
case
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
does
have
power
pursuant
to
this
'27
act
to
impose
its
own
severance
tax,
but
it
hardly
follows
that
the
'27
act
sub
silentio
withdrew
any
power
which
the
tribe
had
as
a
matter
of
its
own
sovereignty
to
impose
a
like
tax
on
activities
which
are
plainly
sufficiently
connected
with
its
interest
to
be
justified.
i
might
say
in
passing
that
the
'27
act
does
not
indicate
a
congressional
intent
to
treat
executive
orders
reservations
differently;
quite
the
contrary.
the
1927
act
is
the
act
which
forbids
the
president
henceforth
to
diminish
or
abolish
executive
order
reservations,
thereby
putting
them
on
the
same
permanent
and
secure
footing
of
treaty
and
congressionally
recognized
reservations,
and
it
is
also
the
act
which
places
vis-a-vis
royalty
in
oil
and
gas
the
executive
order
reservation
indians
on
exactly
the
same
footing
as
an
act
passed
in
1924
had
done
for
those
who
held
their
lands
by
treaty.
the
purpose
of
the
1927
act
was
to
fill
a
gap,
the
'24
act
having
dealt
only
with
treaty
reservations,
or
so
it
had
been
construed.
congress
now
said
it
is
only
right
and
proper
that
the
same
rule
should
apply
on
executive
order
reservations
and
we
make
that
clear
by
imposing
the
identical
scheme.
no
one
could
reasonably
argue
that
indians
on
treaty
reservations
had
no
power
to
impose
this
sort
of
tax,
and
yet
the
'27
act
is
in
every
relevant
respect
identical
to
the
'24
act.
there
is,
of
course,
no
anomaly
in
having
a
right
to
exact
royalty
from
your
own
land,
and
if
you're
a
sovereign
also
to
impose
a
severance
tax.
new
mexico,
louisiana,
and
every
other
state
does
that
without
question.
nor
is
there
any
anomaly
in
having
two
taxes
bear
on
the
same
activity
when
one
has
concentric
territorial
sovereigns.
that
is
familiar
enough
in
the
federal-state
context
but
in
the
indian
context
it's
resolved
by
the
colville
case
itself
in
which
two
taxes,
though
in
that
situation
they
were
found
to
impair
the
viability
of
the
cigarette
business,
were
nevertheless
held
to
be
both
sustainable.
one
final
word
on
the
1927
legislation.
it
is
said
that
there
was
a
carefully
crafted
compromise
in
which
the
indians
somehow
without
it
being
mentioned
lost
their
power
of
taxation.
there
is
not
a
word
in
that
history
to
suggest
that
that
was
the
intent
or
result
of
the
legislation.
mr.
justice
stevens
wondered
why
the
tribes
had
not
before
very
recent
times
imposed
such
taxes,
although
their
reservations
had
been
mined
for
some
years
before.
i
would
answer
that
the
tribes
were
not
alerted
to
their
prerogatives
in
the
'20s
and
'30s...
and,
indeed,
in
the
'40s
and
'50s...
and
only
recently
have
come
to
recognize
what
was
rightly
theirs.
the
same
remark
could
be
made
of
the
cigarette
taxes
which
were
sustained
in
the
colville
case.
that
is
also
a
relatively
new
idea
but
it's
not
a
brand
new
idea,
it's
a
revival
of
an
idea
that
was
prevalent
at
the
turn
of
the
century.
one
has
to
recognize
that
the
cherokee
imposed
a
tax
on
the
exportation
of
hay
whether
or
not
from
private
or
tribal
lands.
it
was
sustained
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
it
was
cited
with
approval
in
this
court's
opinion
in
morris
v.
hitchcock.
morris
v.
hitchcock
of
course
itself
involved
a
tribal
tax
on
cattle
grazing
on
an
indian
reservation.
buster
v.
wright,
cited
with
approval
in
the
two
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
involved
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
by
lot
owners
in
towns
who
owned
their
own
land
and
whose
town
government
had
expressly
been
given
the
power
to
tax
as
well,
to
tax
that
very
privilege.
buster
v.
wright,
therefore,
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
town
tax
and
an
indian
tax,
and
no
power
to
remove,
and
yet
the
court
of
appeal
sustained
the
tax
and
this
court
has
in
both
colville
and
montana
cited
that
decision.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
how
one
calculates
that
limit.
i
think
there
are
assurances
that
that
the
tax
will
not
be
oppressive.
there
is,
first
of
all,
economic
self-incentive
not
to
drive
away
potential
lessees
or
to
have
them
cancel
their
leases
as
they
are
free
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
then,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary,
and
that
approval
is
a
serious
insurance
that
the
tax
rate
will
not
be
out
of
all
bounds
with
the
benefits
conferred
with
the
interests
of
the
tribe
and
with
what
the
traffic
will
bear.
and
finally,
of
course,
there
is
a
congressional
oversight
over
tribal
taxation,
as
we
say
there
is
with
respect
to
state
severance
taxes.
we
have
argued,
or
filed
a
brief
in
the
next
case
in
which
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
occasion
for
a
court
to
determine
what
a
maximum
rate
of
a
severance
tax
is,
but
that
congress
is
free,
and
should
the
privilege
be
abused,
no
doubt
will
intervene
to
set
a
limit.
so
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
told
that
it's
paid
on
whoever
is
the
owner
of
the
minerals
at
the
moment
of
severance.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
in
most
instances.
now,
let
me
explain
the
reason
for
the
wording
of
the
ordinance
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeal,
and
without
any
contrary
guidance--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--they
construe
it
as
a
severance
tax,
and
they
construe
the
words
"sold
or
transported
off
the
reservation.
"
to
mean
sold
on
the
reservation,
or
transported
without
sale,
when
the
pipeline
is
also
the
extractor,
or
sold
by
the
indians
themselves
with
respect
to
any
portion
they
might
take
in
kind.
the
only
exemption
is
not
for
the
indian
royalty
in
kind,
no
matter
what
happens
to
it,
but
only
if
it
is
used
by
them
on
the
reservation.
if
it's
sold
by
them
on
the
reservation...
they
pay
the
tax.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
clear
that
they--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
refer
your
honor
to
page
155
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
makes
clear
how
the
court
of
appeals
construed
this
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
the
tribe
is
in
the
best
position
to
construe
its
own
ordinance
and
they
have
so
construed
it
in
all
courts.
