mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
this
tribal
tax
is
within
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
the
colville
case,
washington
v.
confederated
tribes
of
the
colville
reservation.
we
think
that
it
falls
within
the
statements
made
that
tribal
taxes
are
valid
where
a
tribe
has
a
significant
interest
in
the
subject
matter
and
that
the
interest
is
the
strongest
where
revenues
are
derived
from
values
generated
on
the
reservation
by
activities
involving
the
tribes
and
the
taxpayer
is
the
recipient
of
the
tribal
services.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
no,
your
honor,
but
it
pertains
to
the
general
sovereign
power
of
the
tribes
to
tax,
which
is--
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
--that
was
a
tax
on
cigarette
sales;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
no,
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
has
never
drawn
the
distinction
between
the
powers
and
rights
of
tribes
on
executive
order
reservations...
on
reservations
which
are
created
by
act
of
congress,
or
by
executive
order
reservations.
there
has
never
been
a
distinction
except
in
debates
in
the
congress
before
the
enactment
of
the
'27
act;
and
i'll
go
into
this.
but
this
tax
pertains
only
to
production
on
tribal
lands.
it
does
not
pertain
to
any
production
on
non-indian
fee
lands
or...
in
fact,
there
are
essentially
no
non-indian
fee
lands
on
the
jicarilla
apache
reservation.
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
tribe
is
deeply
involved
in
this
activity.
the
reservation
contains
approximately
three-quarter
million
acres.
over
500,000
acres
are
leased
for
oil
and
gas,
many
of
these
leases
essentially
negotiated
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
at
a
time
when
the
tribe
did
not
really
understand
oil
and
gas
matters.
these
leases
last
for
as
long
as
30,
40,
50
years.
the
leases
in
this
case
were
issued
in
1953
when
conditions
were
quite
different
from
the
conditions
prevailing
at
this
time.
the
impact
of
the
activity
related
to
oil
and
gas
impacts
the
tribe
on
a
daily
basis.
there
are
1,400
wells;
there
are
more
than
400
of
them
drilled
in
the
last
five
years.
the
companies
lay
pipelines.
they
denude
the
surface
of
the
ground
for
roads.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
that's
right.
but
our
contention
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
398(c)
does
not
apply
to
these
leases.
they
were
issued
under
the
1933
act,
which
is
25
usc
396(a)
to
(e).
and
that
was
an
act
to
bring,
that
was
a
comprehensive
leasing
act
whose
express
purpose
was
to
bring
indian
leasing
into
conformity
with
the
indian
reorganization
act.
that
act
made
no
mention
of
state
taxes;
there
was
no
authorization
for
state
taxes.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
we
say
that
398(c),
the
taxing
provision
of
398(c),
was
repealed
by
implication
with
respect
to
taxes
to
leases
issued
after
the
effective
date
of
the
1938
act.
but
we
don't
make
an
issue
of
the
power
of
the
states
to
tax
non-indian
production
on
indian
lands.
i
think
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
what
we
do
say,
that
there
was
no
divestiture
or
no
preemption
by
this
act
of
the
indian
right
to
tax.
there
was
nothing
mentioned
in
the
1927
act
as
to
the
indian
right
to
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
that
isn't
a
valid
argument,
your
honor.
the
compromise
pertained
to
permits
that
had
been
issued
on
indian
reservations
under
the
1920
leasing
act,
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
authority,
according
to
the
attorney
general,
to
lease
executive
order
lands
for
minerals
or
oil
and
gas.
so
secretary
fall
issued
about
some
475
permits
under
the
1920
act.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
pardon?
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
but
when
attorney
general
stone
took
office
he
issued
an
opinion
which
invalidated
these
leases.
in
the
1927
act
the
compromise
which
petitioners
make
a
great
deal
of
to-do
about
was
a
compromise
which
validated
permits
where
the
permittees
had
expended
considerable
sums.
there
was
again
no
question
of
state
versus
indian
taxes.
there
was
really
no
argument
about
state
taxes
because
from
1919
until
1938
all
of
indian
leasing
acts
had
permitted
state
taxation.
in
respect
to
the
tribal
power
to
tax
these
activities,
we
maintain...
and
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
we
tried
to
make
in
the
district
court
and
succeeded
to
some
extent...
although
the
district
court
held
that
the
tribal
services
furnished
to
these
petitioners
were
irrelevant,
nevertheless,
it
is
clear
that
the
jicarilla
apache
tribal
government,
which
is
an
indian
reorganization
act
government,
and
a
very
strong
government,
is
the
only
effective
area
covering
this
three-quarters
of
a
million
acres.
the
tribal
government
furnishes
police,
it
furnishes
fire
protection,
it
has
a
road
department,
it
expends
for
governmental
services
ten
times
what
the
state
of
new
mexico
spends
in
that
area.
in
other
words,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
we
tried
to
make
and
were
successful
in
some
respects
that
the
tribe
was
the
only
effective
government.
it
is
clear
that
these
companies
demand
and
receive
tribal
services.
the
companies'
argument
is
that
the
tribe
should
provide
these
government
services
out
of
the
royalties,
which
is
the
tribe's
compensation
for
the
resource
which
the
energy
companies
are
extracting,
and
they
say,
we
should
have
the
revenues
from
these
royalties
used
for
our
benefit
and
government
services
should
be
provided
from
these
royalties,
not
from
taxes.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
well,
that's
their
definition.
our--
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
--i
think
a
royalty
is...
i
don't
say
the
severance
tax
is
the
compensation,
i
say
that--
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
--the
royalty
is
the
compensation.
i'm
saying
that
their
argument
is
that
the
royalties
should
be
used--
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
--that
the
tribe
does
not
have
the
power
to
tax
them
because
they
were
there
for
30
years
under
a
contract
which
is
frozen,
which
is
inflexible,
which
can't
be
changed.
and
they
may
be
there
for
50
years.
they
say
the
tribe
has
no
power
to
regulate
their
activities
for
the
entire
period
of
the
lease.
they
say
that
the
tribe's
compensation
is
fixed,
which
is
correct.
but
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
the
tribe
cannot
tax
them
to
provide
essential
government
services
which
these
people,
which
benefit
these
people.
the
companies
acknowledged
at
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
that,
that
a
state
receives
royalties
from
its
state
lands,
there
is
no
argument
that
they
will
make
that
a
state
cannot
add
a
tax
to
production
on
state
lands.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
well,
i
think
from
the
old
cases
of
this
court
and
of
the
courts
since
1902,
they
could
anticipate
that
indian
governments
that
were
required
to
furnish
government
services
would
have
to
tax,
otherwise
indian
governments
can't
survive.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
on
that
argument,
your
honor,
that
is
premised
on
the
point
that
taxes
are
consensual,
that
taxes
may
not
be
levied
by
a
sovereign
government
unless
the
taxpayer
consents
to
the
imposition
of
the
tax
and
the
rate
of
the
tax,
and
that
would
indicate
that
a
sovereign
government...
and
i'm
saying
that
the
tribes
have
this
sovereignty...
that
a
sovereign
government
needs
the
consent
of
each
taxpayer
to
levy
a
tax.
and
that
is
not
what
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
with
respect
to
indian
taxes.
in
buster
v.
wright,
a
tax
was
imposed
on
business
lots
where
the
owners
already
had
a
fee
interest.
in
morris
v.
hitchcock
there
were
cattle
on
the
reservation
prior
to
the
imposition
of
the
tax.
this
court
upheld
the
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
your
honor,
that
again
is,
doesn't
really
reach
the
question
of
the
sovereign
power
to
tax.
i
am
saying
that
until
that
power
is
divested,
and
unless
that
power
to
tax
is
inconsistent
with
the
status
of
the
tribe...
which
we
say
it
is
not,
because
it
has
been
recognized
over
a
long
period
of
years...
then
the
tribe
has
this
power.
and
then
from
here
we
get
on
to
the
point
that
the
question
whether
congress
has
divested
the
tribe
of
the
power
to
tax.
mr.
claiborne
will
go
into
the
question
of
the
1927
act,
but
i
do
want
to
mention.
section
110
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978.
congress
in
that
act
specifically
recognized
tribal
severance
taxes
by
permitting
them
to
be
added
to
the
ceiling
price.
and
secondly,
it
recognized
the
possibility,
and
apparently
accepted
the
possibility
of
the
coexistence
of
state
and
tribal
taxes.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
yes,
your
honor,
and
also
i
cannot
believe
that
it
could
be
said
that
congress
divested
the
tribes
of
the
power
to
tax
and
levy
these
severance
taxes,
or
that
these
are
inconsistent
with
any
federal
policy
or
energy
policy
if
congress
permitted
these
taxes
to
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer
by
legislation
enacted
in
1978.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
this
particular
tax?
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
this
particular
tax
has
not
been
imposed.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
i
think
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
history
of
the
development
of
indian
tribes
in
the
last
few
years.
congress
has
expressed
policy
to
effect
self-determination
and
the
tribes'
desire
to--
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
--in
the
federal
government,
absolutely.
the
indian
reorganization
act,
the
self-determination
act,
the
indian
financing
act,
all
of
which...
the
expressed
policy
of
all
of
these
acts
was
to
strengthen
tribal
governments,
to
make
them
self-sufficient.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
none
of
these?
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
no,
your
honor.
all
they
do
is
reaffirm
the
existence
of
the
power
and
reaffirm
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
divest
the
tribes
of
this
power.
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
possibly,
possibly,
but--
mr.
robert
j.
nordhaus
--right.
