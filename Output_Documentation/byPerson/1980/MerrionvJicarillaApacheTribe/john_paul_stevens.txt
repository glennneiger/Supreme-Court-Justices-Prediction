mr.
nordhaus,
before
you
sit
down,
just
as
a
matter
of
history,
is
your
opponent
correct
in
saying
that
this
particular
tax
was
never
imposed
by
the
indians
until
a
few
years
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
kind
of
tax;
the
severance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
that,
as
a
matter
of
history?
why
did
it
take
the
indians
so
long
to
realize
that
they
had
this
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
rely
on
the
change
of
policy
since
1927
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
i
understand
your
argument,
none
of
those
were
really
necessary
to
justify
this
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
these
subsequent
congressional
holdings...
they've
all
existed
since
1930--
