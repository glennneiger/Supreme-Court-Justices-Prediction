mr.
jason
w.
kellahin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
10th
circuit
and
involves
the
power
of
an
indian
tribe
to
tax
non-indians
locally
on
the
indian
reservation.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
quite
simple.
the
jicarilla
apache
tribe
is
an
indian
tribe
occupying
an
executive
order
indian
reservation
located
in
the
northwestern
portion
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
it
is
organized
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
in
1968
it
adopted
a
constitution
which
purported
to
confer
on
the
tribal
council
authority
to
impose
a
tax
on
non-indians.
it
must
be
remembered
that
petitioners
here
were
on
the
indian
reservation
under
valid
oil
and
gas
leases
issued
pursuant
to
federal
law,
signed
on
behalf
of
the
tribe,
and
approved
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
some
of
these
leases
dated
back
to
the
early
1950s,
long
before
the
adoption
of
the
jicarillas'
severance
tax.
the
petitioners
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
district
court
held
the
tribal
ordinance
imposing
a
severance
tax
on
oil
and
gas
severed,
saved,
and
removed
from
tribal
lands,
which
was
adopted
in
1976,
the
district
court
held
that
ordinance
unconstitutional,
illegal,
invalid,
and
void,
and
restrained
the
tribe
from
enforcing
it.
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
five-to-two
decision
reversed,
holding
that
the
power
to
tax
was
an
attribute
of
inherent
tribal
sovereignty,
since
no
treaty
or
act
of
congress
authorized
it.
they
held
that
it
did
not
violate
the
commerce
clause
and
that
the
power
to
tax
had
not
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
that
raises
these
questions
here:
did
the
jicarilla
apache
tribe
retain
as
an
attribute
of
its
inherent
sovereignty
the
power
to
impose
a
severance
tax
on
oil
and
gas
extracted
from
trust
property
on
its
reservation?
has
congress
divested
the
tribe
of
such
power
by
permitting
the
state
to
impose
a
tax
on
this
same
production,
and
by
adopting
a
pervasive
system
of
federal
regulation
of
oil
and
gas
production
and
sale
on
reservation
lands?
mr.
jason
w.
kellahin
no,
sir.
there
is
no
treaty
involved.
mr.
jason
w.
kellahin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jason
w.
kellahin
that
is
correct.
that
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
chief
judge
beth's
dissent
in
the
10th
circuit.
the
state
of
new
mexico...
or
the
territory
of
new
mexico,
i
should
say,
which
included
most
of
arizona
and
southern
california,
came
into
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
and
under
the
late
corporation
of
jesus
christ
of
latter-day
saints
case
it
was
held
that
the
only
sovereign
that
existed
as
of
that
date
was
the
united
states
and
that
all
other
sovereignty
was
derived
from
that
source,
which...
seriously...
poses
a
serious
question
on
the
doctrine
of
inherent
tribal
sovereignty
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
never
any
treaty
entered
into
with
the
jicarilla
apache
tribe
although
several
efforts
were
made
to
do
so;
none
was
ever
signed
and
approved
by
the
senate.
in
connection
with
this
situation
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
issue
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
my
colleague
will
discuss
federal
preemption
and
the
commerce
clause
issues
in
this
case.
the
10th
circuit
opinion
recognized
the
case
presented
an
issue
that
had
not
been
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
pointed
out
that
this
case
presents
the
bald
issue
of
an
indian
tribe's
taxing
power
without
benefit
of
reservations
of
authority
in
a
treaty,
since
no
treaty
or
act
of
congress
authorizes
the
exercise
of
such
taxing
power.
the
court
then
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
right
to
tax
was
an
inherent
aspect
of
the
tribal
sovereignty,
and
with
that
background
it
is
necessary
to
address
the
nature
of
this
sovereignty.
as
i
said,
these
petitioners
were
already
on
the
reservation
under
valid
oil
and
gas
leases
issued
pursuant
to
act
of
congress.
the
leases
stated
the
conditions
under
which
the
petitioners
could
enter
the
reservation
and
the
conditions
that
would
permit
them
to
remain.
the
power
to
tax
was
not
reserved
as
a
condition
of
the
leases.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
unilateral
modification
of
a
contract
by
way
of
taxation
which
the
10th
circuit
upheld.
the
concept
of
indian
sovereignty
relied
on
by
the
10th
circuit
has
had
a
long
and
somewhat
troublesome
history
and
an
examination
of
the
cases,
especially
the
most
recent,
shows
that
the
court
does
not
recognize
the
broad
definition
of
inherent
sovereignty
that
was
relied
on
by
the
10th
circuit
and
supported
by
respondents
in
this
case.
rather,
tribal
sovereignty
has
been
restricted
by
the
tribes'
dependent
status,
and
the
most
recent
case
to
address
this
issue
was
montana
v.
united
states,
which
was
decided
on
march
24.
montana
v.
united
states
clarifies
the
scope
and
extent
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
sovereignty
extends
only
to
the
right
of
indian
tribes
to
make
their
own
laws
and
be
governed
by
them,
to
protect
the
integrity
of
their
tribal
lands
from
encroachment,
and
to
protect
their
tribal
government
from
outside
interference.
that
is
the
tenor
of
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
ruled
on
by
this
court.
tribal
sovereignty
does
not
extend
to
nonmembers
of
the
tribes.
in
montana
v.
united
states
it
was
held
that
the
exercise
of
tribal
power
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
control
the
internal
relations
of
the
tribe
is
inconsistent
with
their
dependent
status,
and
so
cannot
survive
without
the
express
delegation
of
authority
by
congress.
the
case
clearly
holds
that
the
same
lack
of
tribal
authority
to
try
non-indians
for
criminal
offenses
as
was
found
in
oliphant
extends
as
well
to
the
civil
jurisdiction,
and
in
discussing
the
extent
of
civil
jurisdiction
retained
by
the
tribes,
this
court
touched
on
the
very
issue
that
is
raised
in
this
case.
it
pointed
out
that
the
indian
tribes
retained
inherent
sovereign
power
to
exercise
some
forms
of
civil
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
the
court
then
explained,
however,
that
a
tribe
may
regulate
through
taxation,
licensing,
or
other
means
the
activities
of
nonmembers
who
enter
into
consensual
relationships
with
the
tribe
or
its
members
through
commercial
dealings,
contracts,
leases
or
other
arrangements.
in
support
of
this
conclusion
the
court
cited
williams
v.
lee,
morris
v.
hitchcock,
buster
v.
wright,
and
washington
v.
the
confederated
tribes
of
the
colville
indian
reservation.
both
morris
v.
hitchcock
and
buster
v.
wright
were
relied
on
by
the
10th
circuit
in
its
conclusion
that
the
tribe
had
inherent
sovereignty
to
impose
this
tax.
however,
these
were
both
clearly
cases
based
on
the
right
of
the
tribes
to
exclude
nonmembers
and
to
attach
conditions
on
their
right
to
enter
onto
the
reservations.
this
was
reasserted
in
the
court's
decision
in
colville.
in
the
recent
montana
opinion
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
tribe
can
impose
conditions
on
those
who
might
choose
to
enter
the
reservation
lands,
the
indian-owned
lands,
and
hunt
and
fish
by
imposing
fees
or
establishing
bag
limits.
the
analysis
of
tribal
rights
over
non-members
in
the
tribe
was
discussed
in
montana
v.
united
states
and
is
applicable
to
our
case.
petitioners
entered
into
a
consensual
relationship
with
the
tribe.
a
contract
which
imposed
the
conditions
of
their
entry
and
fixed
the
conditions
for
them
to
remain,
that
the
royalties
would
be
paid
and
provided
that
the
rents
and
royalties
could
never
be
increased.
taxation
was
no
part
of
that
contract,
nor
did
the
petitioners
ever
consent
to
taxation
of
that
production.
in
colville
the
court
in
upholding
the
right
of
the
tribe
to
impose
a
tax
on
nonmembers
coming
onto
the
reservation
to
purchase
cigarettes
cited
an
opinion
by
solicitor
marigold
in
1934
where
the
solicitor
pointed
out
that
except
where
congress
has
provided
otherwise
the
power
of
taxation
may
be
exercised
over
nonmembers
so
far
as
such
nonmembers
may
accept
privileges
of
trade,
residence,
and
so
forth,
to
which
taxes
may
be
attached
as
conditions.
mr.
jason
w.
kellahin
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
the
court
found
in
the
colville
case
that
the
treaty
did
permit
the
tribe
to
exclude
non-indians.
in
an
executive
order
indian
reservation,
however,
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
it
has
the
same
right
to
exclude
nonmembers
from
tribal
lands
so
long
as
they
are
held
in
trust
for
that
tribe.
they
have
control
over
their
tribal
lands
although
they
do
not
own
them.
in
colville
this
court
also
pointed
out
that
those
who
come
onto
the
reservation
to
buy
cigarettes
are
free
to
go
elsewhere
and
avoid
the
taxation.
here,
in
this
case,
we
cannot
go
elsewhere,
we
cannot
pick
up
our
mineral
interests
and
move
away.
the
court
in
colville
recognized
that
the
relevant
treaties
can
be
read
to
recognize
inherent
tribal
power
to
exclude
non-indians
and
it
upheld
the
tax
on
that
ground.
this
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
prior
cases
relating
to
indian
taxation
and
relied
on
in
colville
and
in
montana
v.
united
states.
the
result
does
not
require
a
finding
of
governmental
sovereignty
such
as
is
sought
to
be
asserted
here.
under
the
ruling
in
colville
it
is
argued
here
that
the
tribe
has
a
significant
interest...
the
language
used
in
the
colville
decision...
in
the
subject
matter
enabling
it
to
impose
the
tax.
we
do
not
deny,
of
course,
that
the
tribe
has
a
significant
interest
in
its
tribal
lands
and
what
occurs
there.
but
the
tribe's
interest,
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
has
been
assigned
for
the
term
of
the
lease
and
the
conditions
under
which
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
remain
was
spelled
out
in
both
leases,
and
the
tribe
retains
no
significant
interest
which
would
justify
the
tax
in
this
case
as
was
the
situation
in
colville.
any
remaining
interest
would
not
support
that
conclusion.
now,
in
oliphant,
which
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
the
pattern
for
assessment
of
indian
tribal
sovereignty
was
established.
as
shown
in
wheeler,
montana
v.
united
states,
oliphant,
the
indian
tribes
have
lost
a
portion
of
their
sovereignty
by
virtue
of
their
dependent
status.
under
oliphant
the
tribes
may
not
try
non-indians
in
tribal
courts.
under
montana
tribes
cannot
exercise
civil
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
in
the
same
sense
as
the
oliphant
case.
and
oliphant
reasserts
the
limitation
of
indian
sovereignty
as
applying
only
to
the
tribe
and
its
members
and
not
to
non-indians.
this
was
followed
in
colville
and
in
montana.
oliphant,
as
interpreted
in
montana
v.
united
states--
mr.
jason
w.
kellahin
--mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
questioning
i
may
have
left
the
inference
that
i
considered
the
colville
tribe
a
treaty
reservation,
as
occupying
a
treaty
reservation.
that
of
course
is
not
the
case.
they
reside
on
an
executive
order
indian
reservation.
but
as
i
tried
to
explain,
in
my
opinion
that
does
not
affect
the
right
of
the
tribe
to
exclude
non-members
from
tribal
property
and
that
is
the
sole
right
that
they
have
to
enforce
a
tax
against
non-indians.
now,
very
briefly,
i
would
say
that
after
a
tribe
has
negotiated
for,
obtained,
and
its
guardian
has
approved
oil
and
gas
leases
which
set
forth
the
rents
and
the
royalties
to
be
paid
to
the
tribe,
it
cannot
rationally
be
contended
that
the
tribe
reserves
thereafter
the
right
to
retroactively
impose
a
tax
on
those
non-indians
who
are
there
under
the
provisions
of
that
lease.
i
say
retroactively
only
in
the
sense
that
the
contract
had
already
been
negotiated
and
the
imposition
of
the
tax
is
a
change
in
that
contract.
to
allow
the
tribe
to
take
a
captive
lessee,
one
who
cannot
pick
up
his
mineral
interests
and
move
them
off
the
reservation
is
to
allow
it
to
rewrite
the
terms
of
entry
by
imposing
potentially
prohibitive
taxes
on
that
lessee.
for
that
reason
we
submit
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
if
i
have
any
remaining
time,
i
would
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
