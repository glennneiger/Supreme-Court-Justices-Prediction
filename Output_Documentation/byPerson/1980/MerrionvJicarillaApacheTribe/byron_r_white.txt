isn't
the
tribe
the
lessor
in
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
collecting
the
royalty
that's
reserved?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
it
get
paid
in
money
or
in
kind
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
discriminatory...
give
me
your
discrimination
argument,
who
does
it
discriminate
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
it
might
take
its
royalty
in
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
use
the
gas
for
its
own
purposes,
maybe?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
right
now
there's
no
discrimination,
no
actual
discrimination
that
you
can
identify?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
tribe
wanted
to
take
its
royalty
in
kind
and
sell
it
or
use
it
and
it
cost
any
money,
they
might
get
some,
they
could
even
get
congressional
approval
for
it,
in
which
event
you
wouldn't
have
any
case
on
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
agree,
maybe
on
some
other
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
the
state
tax
were
in
the
words
of
the
jicarilla
tax,
it
would
be
invalid
under
your
submission.
namely--
justice
byron
r.
white
--taxing
only
gas
and
oil
that
left
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
might
be
that
because
a
state
couldn't
do
it,
neither
can
the
indian
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
when...
i
take
it,
however,
that
the
first
opportunity
for
an
agency,
the
bureau
or
the
department
of
interior,
or
the
united
states,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
to
address
the
question
you've
just
talked
about,
was
the
jicarilla
tax,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
approved
this
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
official
position
of
the
department
of
interior
apparently
is
that
this...
that
398(c)
does
not
foreclose
such
a
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
i'm
just
asking
whether
the
executive
branch
has
taken
a
position
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
that
prior
construction
evidenced
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
power
of
the
indian
tribe?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
ever
made
express?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
say
that
it
was
for
50
years
the
policy
was
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
a
50-year
policy
to
forbid
indian
taxation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
source
of
that
definition
of
the
severance
tax?
that
there's
compensation
to
a
sovereign
for
the
extraction
of
a
mineral?
that's
on
the
assumption
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--who?
whose
definition?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
severance
tax?
justice
white
you
mean,
just
because
all
the
states
had
them,
so
they
must
have
known
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
indian
land's
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
reference
to
the
montana
case
about
non-indian
land
just
isn't
implicated
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
the
holding
of
the
case?
justice
white
aren't
all
tax
ordinances
like
others
subject
to
the
approval
of
the?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
know,
on
whom
is
this
tax
placed?
who
pays
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's...
and
do
you
know
if
the
gas
is
sold
at
the
wellhead
to
the
pipeline
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
construe
it
as
a
severance
tax,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
ordinance
that
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
they
didn't
think
it
was
paid...
it
certainly
wasn't
paid
by
a
pipeline,
and
they
didn't
think
it
was
paid
for
transportation
or
for
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that,
i
take
it,
is
your
answer
to
at
least
one
of
the
arguments
of
your
opposition?
