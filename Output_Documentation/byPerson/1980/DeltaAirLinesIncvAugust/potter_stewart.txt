now
this
was
a
title
vii
lawsuit,
and
i
know
the
parties
to
some
extent
and
the
amici
to
a
greater
extent,
emphasize
that
it
was
a
title
vii
lawsuit,
but
do
you
think
or
do
you
not
that
that
makes
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
rule
68?
justice
stewart
and
whatever
it
means,
it
means
the
same
thing
in
any
federal
lawsuit.
justice
stewart
well
i
thought
your
point
was,
mr.
kovar,
that
by
definition
any
offer
that
is
higher
than
what
the
plaintiff
eventually
gets,
is
reasonable.
justice
stewart
effectively
considered.
justice
stewart
and
it's
only
then
that
rule
68
is
even
imaginably
applicable.
justice
stewart
that
is
true,
mr.
kovar,
that
she
was
terminated--
justice
stewart
--and
she
was
non-white--
justice
stewart
--and
a
majority
of
the
stewardesses
for
delta
air
lines
were
not
terminated
and
were
not
non-white.
justice
stewart
so,
to
that
extent
she
made
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
stewart
well
if
the
discretion
is
not
exercised
the
prevailing
party
is
awarded
costs,
isn't
he,
under
rule
54?
justice
stewart
except
where
otherwise
ordered.
justice
stewart
ms.
vance,
am
i
to
understand
that,
by
your
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
title
vii
action,
that
the
construction
you
urge
of
rule
68
is
applicable
only
in
title
vii
cases?
justice
stewart
not
rule
68?
justice
stewart
and
that
rule
68
is
what,
simply
inapplicable
in
title
vii
actions?
justice
stewart
--though,
mrs.
stillman,
that
rule
68
means
something
different
in
title
vii
actions
from
what
it
does
in
ordinary
federal
lawsuits,
in
other
federal
lawsuits?
justice
stewart
in
the
federal
court?
justice
stewart
yes.
justice
stewart
what
i
had
in
mind,
in
my
question
to
you,
mrs.
stillman,
was
the
statement
in
the
summary
of
your
argument
that
these
three
independent
grounds,
that
is,
your
construction
of
rule
68...
have
special
force
in
title
vii
suits.
what
does
that
mean.
does
that
mean
they
are
well
illustrated?
or--
justice
stewart
--right.
justice
stewart
well
you're
adding
something
to
the
language
when
you
are
importing
a
component
of
reasonableness.
justice
stewart
doesn't
rule
68--
justice
stewart
--define
what's
reasonable?
if
a
settlement
offer
is
more
than
what
the
plaintiff
actually
recovers,
isn't
that,
by
definition
of
rule
68,
a
reasonable
offer?
justice
stewart
--of
course,
you
only
get
into
an
argument
about
reasonableness
if
you
want
to
argue
about
reasonableness.
if
it's
not--
justice
stewart
--there's
no
necessity
of
any
argument
at
all.
justice
stewart
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stewart
but
this
offer
did
purportedly
include
an
offer
of
attorneys
fees?
justice
stewart
did
it
not?
justice
stewart
well
it
said
$450
which
shall
be
deemed
to
include
attorneys
fees.
justice
stewart
except
insofar
as
the
word
obtain
may
have
some
coloration.
justice
stewart
generally,
obtain
is
to
get
something
that
you've
sought.
