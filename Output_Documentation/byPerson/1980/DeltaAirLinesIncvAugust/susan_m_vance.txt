ms.
susan
m.
vance
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
title
vii
case,
it
does
make
a
difference
that
that
is
true.
to
allow
rule
68
to
operate
in
this
case
would
undercut
the
intent
of
congress
to
promote
vigorous
enforcement
of
title
vii.
this
is
a
complex
case.
title
vii
is
a
complex
statute,
and
litigation
under
title
vii
is
routinely
complex.
this
is
noted
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
this
title
vii
claim
is
an
equitable
claim.
the
key
in
this
case
is
not
money
damages,
but
that
ms.
august
wanted
her
job
back,
she
wanted
the
seniority
that
she
had
lost
when
she
was
terminated
by
delta
air
lines
after
four
years,
she
wanted
the
back
pay
that
she
was
entitled
to
after
she
had
been
terminated,
and
she
wanted
to
be
made
whole
by
being
awarded
her
attorneys
fees
and
costs.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
the
construction...
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
cost
provisions
in
title
vii
is
what
applies
in
this
case,
not--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--that
is
correct.
in,
this
case--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--that
is
correct.
that
is
what
my
argument
is.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
these
rules
shall
apply
to
all
suits
in
federal
courts,
but
i
submit
that
in
the
application
of
those
rules,
it
was
not
the
intent
that
the
cost
provision
of
title
vii
be
disturbed.
that
the
cost
provision
of
title
vii
is
what
applies
here.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
no,
your
honor,
the
judgment
below--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--yes
i
am,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
i
don't
understand
how
it
would
give
me
more
relief
than
i
got
below.
we
didn't
get
any
relief
below
and
we
haven't
gotten
any
relief
to
date.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
in
title
vii
cases,
that's
correct.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
it
said
that
the
offer
was
not
reasonable--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--and
i
submit
that
one--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
i
understand
that.
if
rule
68
applies,
it
is...
it
is
ms.
august's
position
that
the
offer
must
have
been
reasonable.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
i
don't
believe
we
did,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
the
last--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
if
you
look
at
the
last
section
of
my
brief,
which
begins
under
the
third
section--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--which
is
their...
the
cost
provisions
of
title
vii
is
the
applicable--
ms.
susan
m.
vance
--no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
abandoning
it.
i
am
saying
that
the
title
vii
cost
provision
applies,
rule
68
does
not.
if
this
court
decides
that
rule
68
does
apply
in
title
vii
cases,
then
the
question
of
reasonableness
must
be
addressed.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
right,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
i
raised
it
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
yes
i
believe
it
further
supports
the
argument.
and
at
the
appellate
court
level,
we
did
raise
arguments
of
public
policy
and
the
fact
that
title
vii
cannot
be
undercut
by
rule
68,
and
i
believe
that's
incorporated
in
this
argument
that
i
am
making
now.
this
case
was
not
a
simple
case.
this
case
lasted
25
days.
at
the
end
of
ten
days
of
plaintiff's
case,
a
directed
verdict
motion
by
the
defendant
was
not
granted
by
the
district
court.
the
defendant
proceeded
to
spend
approximately
8
to
10
days
presenting
their
case
and
after
that,
the
plaintiff
rebutted.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
no,
i
would
think
that
rule
68
would
apply,
but
i
think
the
question
of
whether
the
offer
of
$450...
whether
that
offer
was
reasonable
would
have
to
be
raised.
and
if
the
plaintiff
had
not
prevailed,
i
don't
think
rule
68
would
have
applied.
the
same
standard
as
addressed
by
christiansburg
in
the
award
of
attorneys
fees
applies
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
the
litigation
brought
by
the
plaintiff
was
frivolous,
unreasonable
or
groundless.
this
court,
just
as
recently
as
monday,
addressed
the
underlying
policy
of
title
vii
in
hughes
case,
saying
that
we
should
not
undercut
title
vii
by
allowing
an
award
against
the
plaintiff
that
will
substantially
interfere
with
their
ability
to
bring
this
kind
of
lawsuit.
in
this
case,
there
were
numerous
incidences
where
black
flight
attendants
were
dealt
with
more
harshly
than
white
flight
attendants.
the
lower
court
said
that
standing
on
rebuttal
the
evidence
would
have
raised
the
necessary
inference
of
racial
bias.
if
that's
not
a
prima
facie
case
then
i
don't
know
what
one
is.
to
allow
a
mechanical
rule,
like
rule
68,
to
operate
to
impose
the
payment
of
costs
on
a
title
vii
plaintiff
like
ms.
august
would
void
all
the
public
policy
embodied
in
title
vii
and
close
the
door
on
all
but
the
airtight
cases,
a
proposition
this
court
rejected,
in
christiansburg
in
1978.
if
this
court
determines
that
rule
68
applies
in
title
vii
cases,
it
still
doesn't
apply
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
must
prevail.
the
operative
sentence
in
the
rule
reads
that
if
a
judgment
finally
obtained
by
the
offeree
is
not
more
favorable
than
the
offer,
the
offeree
must
pay
the
cost
incurred
after
the
making
of
the
offer.
ms.
august
didn't
obtain
anything.
her
complaint
was
dismissed
with
prejudice
after
25
days
of
trial.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
she
didn't
obtain
anything.
the
common
sense
of
that
phrase,
if
you
read
the
entire
sentence,
and
not
just
the
words
must,
like
delta
would
have
us
do,
but
if
you
read
the
entire
sentence,
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
is
that
the
plaintiff
must
prevail.
if
you
look
at
the
advisory
committee
notes
you
see
a
reference
to
three
state
statutes:
minnesota,
montana
and
new
york.
that's
all
it
said
in
the
advisory
committee
notes,
and
i
submit
that
that
means
that
those
statutes
and
the
case
law
underlying
them
was
incorporated
as
a
reference
to
tell
us
what
to
do
with
rule
68.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
you
see
what
would
happen
if
you
allowed
the
rule
to
operate
that
way,
is
it
will
totally
destroy
any
of
the
discretion
contained
in
rule
54(d)
with
respect
to
the
defendants
that
prevail.
and
i
think
that
the
rules
were
meant
to
operate,
not
in
a
vacuum...
rule
68
isn't
a
rule
that's
totally
unrelated
to
any
other
rule.
rule
68
is
a
rule
that's
designed,
even
if
you
look
at
how
the
rules
are
set
out,
rule
54(d)
is
set
out
in
the
judgment
section,
it's
the
cost
provision
for
plaintiff...
for
prevailing
parties.
rule
68
is...
and
it
says,
that
except
where
express
provision
therefor
is
made
by
a
statute
or
a
rule,
prevailing
parties
as
of
course
will
be
awarded
their
costs
in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
if
you
look
at
rule
68,
it's
contained
in
the
provisional
remedies
section
of
the
rule,
it's
the
exception.
it's
the
exception
where
the
party
prevailing
shouldn't
get
its
costs
paid.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
because
rule
68
applies
to
where
a
party
prevails
but
wins
less
than
the
offer.
if
an
instance
where
the
party
brought
an
action
and
continued
in
the
action
and
ultimately
won
something,
but
took
up
the
time
of
the
court
to
determine
the
relief
that
they
were
entitled
to,
when
they
could
have
solved
that
problem
themselves.
what
it
is,
rule
68
operates
when
there's
admitted
liability,
or
when
liability
is
found.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
for
special
reasons,
that's
right.
it
does
allow
that.
and
that
is
done
under
special
circumstances.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case,
ms.
august
didn't
prevail,
and
the
costs
are
being
sought
by
the
prevailing
party
from
her.
and
what
delta
wants
to
do
is
to
be
able
to
make
a
nominal
offer,
even
an
offer
as
they
have
said,
one
penny,
and
trigger
the
rule
so
that
they
won't
have
to
worry
about
whether
or
not
they
will
get
their
costs
at
the
end
of
the
litigation.
if
you
use
the
rules
the
way
they
want
to
use
the
rules
it
means
that
in
every
case,
in
the
anti-trust
case
you
were
talking
about,
a
penny
won't
be
enough
if
the
plaintiff
bringing
the
case
doesn't
win
anything.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
then,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
court,
if
the
court's
going
to
apply
the
rule,
then
the
court
has
to
address
the
question
of
whether
the
offer
was
reasonable.
in
this
case,
the
court
didn't
have
any
trouble
deciding,
none
of
the
four
judges
had
any
difficulty
at
all
deciding
that
the
$450
offer
is
not
worthy
of
review
by
the
plaintiff.
if
you
look
at
the
general
provisions
in
the
state
practice,
before...
before
rule
68
was
enacted,
the
general
rule
is
that
losing
parties
pay
the
winning
parties'
costs.
statutes,
like
rule
68,
were
enacted
to
prevent
abuse
of
this
rule.
these
statutes
are
the
only
explanatory
reference
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
and
should
be
incorporated.
then
in
1938,
the
federal
rules
were
adopted.
the
same
harmonious
scheme
that
had
been
working
since
1862,
since
the
civil
war,
was
the
statutory
scheme
that
was
adopted
in
the
federal
rules.
there
was
no
reason
that
it
should
work
any
differently
than
it
had
before
and
if
you
look
at
the
case
law
that's
under
those
statutes,
you'll
see
that...
there
is
not
one
reported
case
where
the
defendant,
where
the
prevailing...
where
the
offer
of
judgment
was
used
to
give
costs
to
a
party
that
prevailed,
where
the
party
bringing
the
lawsuit
hadn't
won
something.
if
you
look
at
the
disparity
between
those
figures
in
all
of
those
cases,
they're
very
close.
that's
because
what
those
people
did
is,
they
took
up
the
time
of
the
court,
to
figure
out
how
much
relief
should
be
awarded
and
that's
what
the
rule
was
designed
to
do,
was
to
cut
out
the
time
that
the
courts
were
going
to
spend
when
liability
was
known.
in
any
case,
if
the
purpose
of
rule
68
is
to
be
served,
the
purpose
being
to
encourage
settlements
and
to
avoid
protracted
litigation,
offers
have
to
be
reasonable.
four
judges
found
that
delta's
offer
was
not
reasonable.
the
burden
isn't
just
on
the
plaintiff
to
be
realistic
when
they're
litigating,
and
when
you
make
an
offer
of
judgment
as
the
defendant
here...
or
as
delta
here
is
suggesting,
there
is
no
additional
risk
to
them.
in
fact,
what
there
is,
is
the
security...
if
the
rule
is
going
to
operate
the
way
they
suggest...
in
knowing
that
your
costs
are
ultimately
covered.
all
the
rest
of
the
risks
of
litigation
are
already
going
to
clearly
be
incurred
by
the
defendant.
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
light
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
offer
wasn't
worth
considering.
i
submit
to
you
that
it
was
a
sham.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
it
does
not
show...
the
record
does
not
show.
in
the
seventh
circuit
we
routinely
file
any
contingent
fee
arrangement
that
we
have,
we're
required
to
do
that
by...
with
the
court.
if
you
would
like
to
know
what
that
was,
i'll
be
glad
to
tell
you.
ms.
susan
m.
vance
you
file
it
at
the
time
you
begin
the

at
the
time
you

are
required
to
file
any
contingent
