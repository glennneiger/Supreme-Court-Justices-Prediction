justice
jr.
ms.
vance,
may
i
ask
whether
the
record
shows
that
fee
arrangement
with
plaintiff's
counsel
was
a
contingent
fee
arrangement?
justice
jr.
you
file
this
prior
to
trial?
justice
jr.
if
it's
not
in
the
record
i
suppose
that's
the
answer.
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
at
the
outset?
was
the
fee
arrangement
by
plaintiff's
counsel
a
matter
of
public
record
at
the
time
the
offer
of
your
client
was
made?
justice
jr.
was
that
because
you
didn't
look
at
the
record
or
because
it
wasn't
there
when
you
made
the
offer?
justice
jr.
is
that
the
general
practice
at
the
chicago
bar?
justice
jr.
that's
not
the
rule
in
virginia.
