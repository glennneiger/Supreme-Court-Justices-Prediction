justice
stevens
mr.
kovar,
on
this
point,
i
noticed
the
trial
lasted
25
days,
was
it?
justice
stevens
and
i
don't,
maybe
i
just
don't
remember,
but
do
we
have
an
idea
of
what
the
costs
you
propose
to
assess
against
the
plaintiffs
come
to?
justice
stevens
they
would
cover
things
like
transcript
costs,
i
suppose,
at
the
very
least?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
reason
you
would
ask
for
less
than
you
are
statutorily
entitled
to?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
it's
probably
several
thousand
dollars?
justice
stevens
do
you
know,
for
example,
whether
you
are
seeking
attorneys
fees?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
take
the
position,
i
take
it,
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law
you
would
be
entitled
to
ask
for
them
as
costs
under
the
title
vii
case;
to
that
extent,
this
may
be
a
different
title
vii
factor
may
make
a
difference
have.
justice
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
under
your
view
of
rule
68,
if
a
defendant,
defense
bar
routinely
made
a
$10
settlement
offer
in
every
case,
that
would
have
the
effect
of
taking
away
the
discretion
of
the
judge
under
rule
54
if
the
defense
had
ultimately
prevailed?
and
that
would
really
be
a
sound
practice
for
the
defense
bar
to
do
that
routinely
then?
justice
stevens
if
that
is
a
correct
reading
of
the
rule,
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
it's
taken
so
long
for
the
defense
bar
to
realize
that
rule
was
there,
and
had
that
potential
benefit?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
it's
possible
that
they
read
the
words
mr.
justice
blackmun's
suggestion
a
moment
ago.
justice
stevens
well
that
isn't
the
answer
to...
the
answer
is
that
it
wouldn't
cover
this
case.
rule
68
only
applies
to
cases
where
the
plaintiff
prevails
in
part.
justice
stevens
you
need
rule
54(d)
to
apply
the
case
where
the
defendant
wins.
justice
stevens
but
it
would
encourage
settlements
and
would
self-define
reasonableness,
if
you
limit
the
application
to
the
rule
to
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
recovers
something.
then
by
hypothesis,
any
offer
that
was
higher
would
have
been
reasonable.
justice
stevens
you're
only
getting
into
arguments
about
reasonableness
if
you
do
not
confine
the
operation
of
the
rule
to
cases
involving
judgments
obtained
by
the
offeree,
which
is
of
course
what
the
rules
says.
justice
stevens
i
can't
see
how
an
offer...
if
the
plaintiff
recovers
something
and
was
offered
something
more,
by
hypothesis,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
offer
would
have
been
reasonable.
in
other
words,
if
she
had
recovered
$250
here,
then
i
would
say
the--
justice
stevens
--certainly.
there're
a
million
cases
say
you
can
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
which
involves
a
construction
of
rule
68
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
pursuant
to
that
rule,
if
a
plaintiff
rejects
a
defendants'
formal
offer
of
settlement
and
if
the
judgment
finally
obtained
by
the
offeree
is
not
more
favorable
than
the
offer,
the
plaintiff
must
pay
the
cost
incurred
after
the
making
of
the
offer.
the
narrow
question
presented
by
the
case
is
whether
the
words,
"judgment
obtained
by
the
offeree"
as
used
in
that
rule
should
be
construed
to
encompass
a
judgment
against
the
offeree
as
well
as
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
offeree.
the
respondent
filed
a
complaint
against
delta
airlines
alleging
that
she
had
been
discharged
from
her
position
as
a
flight
attendant
solely
because
of
her
race,
a
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
she
sought
reinstatement
approximately
$20,000.00
in
backpay,
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
a
few
months
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
defendant
made
a
formal
settlement
offer
to
plaintiff
in
the
amount
of
$450.
the
offer
was
refused.
the
case
was
tried
and
plaintiff
lost.
the
district
court
entered
judgment
in
favor
of
defendant
directed
at
each
party
bear
its
own
costs.
defendant
then
moved
for
modification
of
the
judgment
contending
that
under
rule
68,
the
plaintiff
should
be
required
to
pay
the
costs
incurred
by
defendant
after
the
offer
of
judgment
had
been
refused.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
$450
was
not
a
reasonable
good
faith
attempt
to
settle
the
case
and
therefore
did
not
trigger
the
cost-shifting
provisions
of
the
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
same
ground.
in
finding
a
reasonable
requirement
in
the
rule,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
confront
the
threshold
questions
whether
rule
69
has
any
application
at
all
to
a
case
in
which
judgment
is
entered
against
the
plaintiff
and
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
we
answer
that
question
by
holding
that
the
rule
simply
does
not
apply
to
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
is
the
party
who
obtains
the
judgment
and
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stewart
have
joined.
