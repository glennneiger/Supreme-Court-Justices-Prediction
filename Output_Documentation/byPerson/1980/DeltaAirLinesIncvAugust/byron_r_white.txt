justice
white
well
rules
are
rules.
rules
don't--
justice
white
the
same
result
if
you
had
offered
a
penny?
justice
white
this
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
judgment
below,
was
it?
justice
white
and
you
are
seeking
to
support
it
on
another
ground,
then?
justice
white
and
wouldn't
this
give
you
more
relief
than
you
got
below?
or
not?
justice
white
yes.
what
if
you
win
here,
on
this
ground?
it
means
that
rule
68
is
never
applicable
in
a
title
vii
case?
justice
white
and
that
the
court
below
would
have
thought
it
would,
it
was
applicable
if
there
was
a
fair
offer?
justice
white
well
that's--
justice
white
--that's
on
the
assumption
that
68
applies?
justice
white
that's
a
considerably
different
result,
if
we
sustained
your--
justice
white
well
did
you
argue
that
way
in
your
brief,
here?
justice
white
then
you
defend
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
justice
white
could
i
ask
though,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
that
rule
68
was
inapplicable?
justice
white
and
was
it
presented
there?
justice
white
well
do
you
know
whether
it
was
presented?
justice
white
assuming
that
it
was
not,
do
you
suggest
that
the
respondent
is
nevertheless
entitled
to
raise
it
here?
justice
white
that's
hardly
what
i
asked.
justice
white
well
what
if
it
wasn't?
justice
white
then
why
should
you?
well
why
not,
it's
an
independent--
justice
white
well,
i
was
just
asking
you,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
argument
was
raised
below
or
not?
justice
white
so
you're
changing
your
answer?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
and
attorneys
fees
though,
wouldn't
be
taxed
unless
the
plaintiff
prevailed.
justice
white
let's
hear
a
response
to
the
claim
that
your
offer
did
not
cover
costs.
justice
white
so
your
$450
of
costs,
except
for
attorneys
fees,
were
to
be
covered
in
addition
to
the
$450?
