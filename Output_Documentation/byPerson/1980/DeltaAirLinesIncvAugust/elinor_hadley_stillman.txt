ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
the
united
states
are
participating
in
this
case
because
it
is
a
title
vii
case
and
because
we
think
the
purposes
of
title
vii
would
be
undermined
if
rule
68
were
permitted
to
operate
as
petitioner
asserts
it
should
operate.
we
have
not
argued
that
rule
68
doesn't
apply
in
title
vii
actions,
although
we
would
certainly
urge
the
court
as
one
of
the
amici
has,
to...
if
it
assumed
that
rule
68
applied
in
title
vii
actions,
to
limit
its
decision
and
not
decide
the
question
of
class
actions
at
this
time.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it
presents
difficult
problem--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--your
honor,
we
made
three
arguments
in
our
brief,
and
as
to
two
of
those
arguments,
we
think
they
would
apply
to
any
type
of
civil
action.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
in
the
federal
court,
yes.
the
first
argument,
whether
we
think
the
rule
does
not
apply
where
the
offeree
does
not
finally
obtain
a
judgment.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
think
this
is
plain
from
its
language,
and
by
the
way,
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
i
think
it's
plain
from
the
language
of
the
original
rule
in
1938,
which
was
somewhat
changed
in
1946,...
this
is
not
in
our
brief,
but
is
the
result
of
recent
enlightenment...
the
original
rule
said
"if
the
adverse
party
fails
to
obtain
a
judgment
more
favorable
than
that
offered,
he
shall
not
recover
costs
in
the
district
court
from
the
time
of
the
offer,
but
shall
pay
them
from
that
time.
"
the
clear
premise
there
of
the
drafters
was
they
were
assuming
that
otherwise
he
would
have
recovered
his
costs
and
this
comes
straight
out
of
of
the
state
practice
and
those
three
state
statutes
that
were
cited
by
the
drafters,
that
generally
the
prevailing
party
recovered
costs
and
this
was
a
rule
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
where
the
prevailing
plaintiff
had
turned
down
a
reasonable
offer.
what
the
rule
is
designed
to
do
is
to
prevent
someone
from
prolonging
litigation
when
a
reasonable
offer
was
made
to
them.
the
rule
will
never
work
if
defendants
are
permitted,
as
they
have
candidly
announced
here,
that
will
be
the
routine
practice
of
the
defense
bar,
if
they
come
in
and
make
one
penny
offer
served
with
the
complaint...
served
with
the
answer,
i
suppose...
it
can
only
have
two
results:
one
result
is,
the
party
will
turn
down
the
offer
because
it's
patently
unreasonable
and
who
would
want
to
accept
such
an
offer;
the
other
thing
is
that
in
the
other
possible
result
that
is
in
those
cases
where
the
plaintiff
is
in
very
precarious
financial
situation,
typical
title
vii
cases,
those
are
the
ones
on
whom
the
rule
might
exert
pressure
to
accept
even
an
unreasonable
offer,
for
fear
of
being
socked
with
costs,
with
defense
costs
at
a
later
time.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
why
do
you
need
rule
54(d)?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
suppose
that
they
wanted
greater
certainty
with
respect
to
offers
of
judgment
and
to
confine--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--correct.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
answer.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
i
would
say
this
about
54(d).
i
think
what
the
petitioners
are
complaining
about
here
is
that
they
don't
like
the
way
rule
54(d)
has
been
applied
recently
by
district
courts.
and
so
they
want
to
misuse
rule
68,
to
repair
what
they
think
is
an
incorrect
use
of
rule
54(d).
i
think
that's
really
what's
going
on
here.
i
don't
see
that
rule
54...
rule
68
becomes
unnecessary
if
rule
54(d)
applies,
because
in
the
rule...
in
rule
54(d)
the
prevailing
party
ordinarily
recovers
his
costs
unless
the
court
directs
otherwise.
what
rule
68
will
do
is
reverse
that
presumption,
really;
when
the
losing
defendant
shows
that
he
made
a
reasonable
offer.
and
that's
the
effect
of
rule
68.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well
we
don't
think
we're
wrong
that
assumption.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
yes,
we
weren't
trying
to
argue
that
they
didn't
apply.
that's
a...
just
simply
a
way
of
saying
that
it's
quite
important
here
that
the
correct
result
be
reached.
but
i
think
this
court
illustrates
the
real
hardships
and
some
of
the
real
difficulties
of
applying
the
rule...
and
also,
the
application
of
rule
1,
which
the
chief
justice
referred
to,
that
rule
1
does
say
that
you've
got
to
apply
the
rules
in
a
way
that
reaches
just
results
and
i
think
that
you
would
not
reach
a
just
result
if
you
applied
it
in
the
way
that
they
insist
it
should
be
applied,
and
which
is
not
necessary
from
the
language.
but
they've
tried
to
suggest
that
somehow
there
is
a
quarrel
here
about
the
word
must,
and
that
we
are
somehow
saying
that
must
doesn't
mean
must.
well
of
course
we
say
it
means
must;
the
question
is
whether
the
rule
applies
or
not.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
and
we're
not
torturing
the
language
in
any
way,
in
the
construction
that
we're
making
of
it.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
true.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
reasonable
common
sense
addition
that--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--implication.
i
think
what
they're
doing
is--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--no,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
so.
because
we
think
that...
i'm
relying
here
on,
i
suppose,
common
sense.
but
i'm
also
relying
on
what
the
drafters
said
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
and
the
purpose...
i
mean,
what
everyone
understood
the
purpose
of
the
rule
to
be,
which
was
to
encourage
judgment...
to
encourage
settlements.
and
it
wouldn't
encourage
settlements
to
allow
defendants
to
make
unreasonable
offers.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--i'm
not
sure
i
want
to
concede
that,
your
honor.
but
i
understand
what
your
argument
is.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
but...
but
she
was
also
asking
for
equitable
relief.
and...
no,
i
think
that
you
could
hypothesize
cases
in
which
she
might
have
recovered
something
less
and
yet
the
offer
would
not
have
been
reasonable.
i
think--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--i
don't
think
reasonableness
is--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--you
wouldn't
need
to,
no,
i...
these
are
independent
grounds.
we've
certainly
argued
and
recognized
that
these
are
independent
grounds
and
that
if
you
decide
that
it
doesn't
apply
in
the
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
not
the
prevailing
party
you
wouldn't
have
any
reasonableness
at
all.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
and
you
wouldn't
also
have
to
reach
our
other
argument
which
i
was
going
to
devote
my
time
to,
that
costs
in
title
vii
actions
includes
attorneys
fees,
because
costs
takes
its
meaning
from
statutory--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--no.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
were
not--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--i
think
that
they--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well
we've
been
known
to
do
so.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
be
flip.
i
think
that
if
it
was
implicit
in
the
argument
that
they
were
making
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
could
raise
it
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
if
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
the
law
of
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
lovasco
and
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
sears-roebuck
is
that
they
should
not
raise
it
here.
although
that's
usually
with
the
petitioner
and
not
supporting
the
judgment
on
an--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--it's
an
independent
ground
for
supporting
the
judgment,
and
it
wouldn't
change
the
judgment.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
right.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
if
we're
supporting
a
judgment
and
not
attempting
to
change
the
scope
of
the
judgment.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
would
finally
emphasize
that
we
do
think
that
a
rule
68
offer,
if
the
court
needs
to
reach
this
ground,
a
rule
68
offer
in
the
title
vii
case
does
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
rule
if
it
does
not
include
an
offer
of
attorneys
fees
because
in
a
title
vii
case,
by
definition
costs
includes
attorneys
fees.
and
the
rules,
the
federal
rules
do
not
define
attorneys
fees.
you
have
to
look
to
statute
to
find--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--that...
but
that's
not--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--that's
not...
well
it
didn't
offer
it
as
part
of
costs.
and
the
rule
says--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--we
don't
think
that
complies
with
the
rule,
because
the
rule
says
you
have
to
make
an
offer
and
then
you
have
to
offer
to
pay
costs
then
accrued;
and
you
can't
limit
what
accrued
costs
are.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
you
mean
if
they
reached
some
agreement?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
oh
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
your
honor,
this
would
operate
just
in
the
way...
in
the
same
way
the
taxable
items
of
costs
under
section
1920
would
operate.
it
may
be
that
certain
events
have
occurred,
but
the
parties
have
incurred
certain
expenses
for
photocopying,
for
example,
and
they
might
say
those
are
my
costs,
but
what's
later
taxed
is
what
the
court
determines
was
necessarily
obtained.
and
it's
really--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--but
if
the
plaintiff
prevails
through
a
settlement
under
this
court's
decision
in
maher
v.
gagne,
and
i
see
no
reason
that
this
wouldn't
be
treated
the
same.
they
could
expect
to
recover
attorneys
fees
in
a
title
vii
case;
absent
special
circumstances,
but
even
accrued
costs,
taxable
cost
items,
can
be
defeated
by
subsequent
decisions
of
the
court.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
this
is--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--well
we're
talking
about
the
operation
of
rule
68
here,
where
they've
made
an
offer
and
if
it
has
been
accepted,
the
court
would
enter
judgment
on
it.
and
we
assume
that
that
would
entitle
attorneys
fees...
prevailing
plaintiff,
at
that
point
the
plaintiff
would
prevail
through
the
settlement,
by
definition,
under
this
court's
decisions
as
we
read
them.
and
would
be
entitled
to
the
attorneys
fees.
we
ask
then
that
the
court
uphold
the
judgment
below
on
any
of
the
three
independent
grounds
we
think
each
of
them
would
support
it.
thank
you.
