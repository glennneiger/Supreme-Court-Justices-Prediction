justice
blackmun
--mr.
kovar--
justice
blackmun
--what,
in
your
offer,
what
did
the
term
costs
include?
what
did
you
mean
by
costs?
justice
blackmun
did
it
include
attorneys
fees
up
to
that
point?
justice
blackmun
--there
is
an
assertion
here
that
counsel
spent
up
to
the
time
of
your
offer
some
39
hours,
and
that
her
hourly
rate
was
$50.
i
take
it
you
questioned
that?
justice
blackmun
mr.
kovar,
let
me
interrupt.
i'd
like
to
follow
through
on
one
other
thing,
too.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
robert
dodge's
remarks
back
in
1938,
which
as
i
read
them,
had
to
do
with
the
restriction
of
rule
68
to
the
situation
where
there
is
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
and
not
a
verdict
for
the
defendant?
justice
blackmun
mr.
kovar,
i
take
it
from
your
answer
that
you
don't
buy
the
dodge
remark?
justice
blackmun
then
your
point
two
is
by
its
terms
rule
68
applies
only
to
plaintiffs
who
prevail?
justice
blackmun
right.
justice
blackmun
i
understand
that,
but
i
didn't...
as
i
read
your
brief,
i
didn't
realize
you
were
completely
abandoning
the
application
of
rule
68
to
your
case.
justice
blackmun
you're
not
professing
surprise,
are
you?
