we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
delta
air
lines,
inc.
v.
august.
mr.
kovar,
i
think
probably
you
may
now
proceed
without
any
interference
from
the
audience,
t.v.,
or
otherwise.
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
think
the
rule
1
effect
may
be,
if
any;
does
the
concept
of
rule
1
pervade
all
of
the
rules?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
that
embraces
the
idea
that
good
faith
offers
are...
that
an
offer
must
be
a
bona
fide
offer?
chief
justice
burger
--deal
with
ransom
for
kidnapped
children
but
they
do
deal
with
offers.
chief
justice
burger
would
you
say
a
bad
faith
offer
was
just?
chief
justice
burger
did
washington
against
davis
have
any
implications
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
that's
why
i
said--
--it
involves
the
constitution,
not
title
vii.
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
burger
in
this
respect,
you
don't
have
to
defend
the
idea
of
a
$1.00
offer,
do
you?
you
offered
how
much,
again?
chief
justice
burger
$450.00.
chief
justice
burger
--plus
costs,
so
that--
chief
justice
burger
in
round
figures,
would
you
give
us
some
idea
of
what
the
costs
would
mean,
$10,
$50,
$100?
chief
justice
burger
so
that,
as
i
understand
that--
chief
justice
burger
i
take
it
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
system
wants
a
good
faith
component
in
the
rule,
the
rule
should
be
rewritten?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
vance.
chief
justice
burger
it's
in
the
public
record.
where
is
it
filed,
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
burger
well
may
we
judicially
notice
if
you
tell
us
about
it?
chief
justice
burger
before
you
sit
down
though,
since
the...
whatever
statement
you
filed
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
that
we
can
notice,
will
you
tell
us
what
it
is?
chief
justice
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
stillman.
chief
justice
burger
is
that
idea
not
somewhat
hypothetical,
if
there
was
a
settlement
wouldn't
the
settlors
say,
this
is--
chief
justice
burger
--for
all
claims,
including
attorneys
fees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kovar,
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
if
you're
going
to
use
all
of
it
or
substantially
all
of
it,
we'll
not
ask
you
to
divide
it
two
minutes
now
and
seven
minutes
later.
would
you
prefer
to
start
at
1:00
o'clock
with
your
response,
your
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
proceed
then,
and
we
will
finish
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
delta
airlines
against
august
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
