mr.
e.
allan
kovar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
asking
that
defendants
be
given
the
right,
short
of
complete
capitulation
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
burdens
of
unwarranted
and
costly
litigation.
we
believe
that
rule
68,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
provide
such
a
right.
in
this
regard,
we
note
mr.
justice
stewart's
admonition
in
the
christiansburg
case,
in
which
he
noted
that
many
defendants
are
small,
mid-size
employers,
and
that
the
expense
of
defending
even
a
frivolous
claim
may
become
a
strong
disincentive
to
the
exercise
of
their
legal
rights.
we
submit
that
the
public
policy
with
respect
to
title
vii
actions
does
indeed
ask
that
it
be
easier
to
bring
meritorious
suits.
but
it
is
no
less
a
public
policy
in
title
vii
actions
that
there
should
be
a
diminishment
of
unjustified
suits.
and
we
contend
that
this
court
should
not
condone
or
permit
the
employer-defendant
to
be
held
under
economic
hostage
of
protracted
litigation.
and
we
submit
that
rule
68
provides
a
realistic
access
to
such
freedom.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
it
does
not
make
any
difference,
your
honor.
i
think
that
rule
68
is
clear
on
its
face,
and
that
it
has
no
exceptions--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--that
is
our
position,
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
indeed
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
as
i
understand
it,
rule
1
says
that
all
the
rules
shall
be
construed
to
secure
the
just,
speedy
and
inexpensive
determination
of
every
action.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
think
the
idea
of
good
faith
offer
or
a
bona
fide
offer
or
a
genuine
offer
or
a
reasonable
offer
has
absolutely
no
application
under
rule
68,
any
more
than
it
has
application
as
to
what
is
a
reasonable
ransom
request
for
a
kidnapped
child
or
iranian
hostages.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--the
concept
is
applicable.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
the
case
of
rule
1,
it
says
justice
is
one
of
the
three
aspects
that
we
should
be
looking
to,
and
in
the
case
at
hand,
in
may
of
1977,
defendant
offered
this
plaintiff
the
judgment.
she
did
not
receive
judgment.
plaintiff
offered
$450,
$450
more
than
the
plaintiff
received.
the
plaintiff
offered
costs--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--if
the
ultimate
judgment
was
nothing,
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
would
be
the
determination,
if
reasonableness
is
an
applicable
quality,
that
would
be
the
determination
and
the
definition
of
what
is
reasonable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
rule
1,
it
says
that
it
should
not
only
be
just
but
speedy.
the
offer
is--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--i
don't
think
there's
any
such
thing
as
a
bad
faith
offer,
your
honor.
if
we
are
offering
judgment
to
a
plaintiff,
our
motivation
is
no
more
important
than
is
the
motivation
of
the
plaintiff
in
determining
whether
an
action
is
vexatious.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
rule
1
also
says
that
in
terms
of
speedy
being
one
of
the
qualities,
that
a
may
12
offer
of
judgment
certainly
is
speedier
than
a
june
12,
1978
judgment.
and
rule
1
says
it
should
be
inexpensive.
the
very
time
involved
in
the
litigation
as
distinguished
from
the
offer
of
judgment
which
was
made
in
may
of
'77,
would
indicate
that
it
would
have
been
far
less
expensive
for
the
offer
of
judgment
to
have
prevailed,
in
the
clear
reading,
as
we
believe
it
clear,
of
rule
68
to
have
prevailed.
we
can
take
notice
that
here
today,
november
12,
1980
a
good
deal
of
time
and
a
good
deal
of
money
have
gone
under
the
bridge
in
this
matter.
just
very
briefly,
in
terms
of
the
background
of
this
case,
this
was
a
title
vii
case
but
there
were
two
counts
to
it.
one
was
the
title
vii,
the
second
was
the
libel
and
slander.
that
second
count
was
dismissed
on
motion
of
defendant
for
summary
judgment
prior
to
the
trial
without
objection
by
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff,
due
to
the
fact
i
submit,
that
in
deposition
plaintiff
admitted
she
had
no
evidence
whatsoever
as
to
any
libel
or
slander
statements
by
the
defendant.
as
to
the
first
count,
the
title
vii
count
which
did
go
to
trial,
respondent
by
its
briefs
would
have
this
court
believe
that
there
was
a
close
question
of
liability.
for
example,
at
page
13
of
the
brief,
it
was
stated,
"as
the
district
court
observed,
ms.
august
at
least
had
presented
a
prima
facie
case.
"
and
at
page
21
of
the
brief,
the
respondent's
counsel
notes,
"in
this
case,
the
district
court
noted
that
ms.
august's
evidence
unrebutted
would
have
been
sufficient
to
support
her
claim.
"
and
the
court
of
appeals
supported
the
lower
court
opinion.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
and
the
circuit
court's
opinion
as
to
the
merits
would
find
that
that
was
not
the
case;
that
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
itself,
found
that
by
cross-examination
of
the
plaintiff
and
plaintiff's
witnesses,
there
was
equal
evidence,
equal
number
of
cases,
where
blacks
were
favored
or
whites
were
disfavored.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
that
that
would
create
a
prima
facie
case;
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
adverse
employment
decision
affected
a
member
of
a
protected
minority
does
not,
in
my
opinion,
create
a
prima
facie
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
seventh
circuit...
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
it
is
my
recollection,
your
honor,
that
that
involves
a
different
level
of
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case
in
terms
of
governmental
actions
as
distinguished
from
private.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
did
note,
however,
that
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
its
decision
on
the
merits,
that
the
plaintiff
offered
some
proof
which
suggested
discrimination,
but
the
evidence
was
superficial,
incomplete,
inadequate
or
otherwise
defective.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
a
finding
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
there
was
even
a
prima
facie
case.
now
we've
called
for
these
corrections
to
be
noted
in
order
to
dispel
any
implication
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
victim
of
the
vagaries
of
complex
litigation
that
was
simply
not
involved
here.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
no
sir,
we
do
not,
there
was
never
a
bill
of
costs
submitted
to
the
court
because
of
the
denial
of
our
rule
68
motion,
and
all
references
to
costs
in
the
briefs,
for
that
reason,
are
extra
records,
there
is
no
reference
in
the
record,
to-wit--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--well,
inasmuch
as
no
bill
of
costs
was
submitted,
i
don't
know
what
particular
costs
the
defendant
would
be
submitting
to
the
court,
nor--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--without
conferring
with
my
client,
i
would
not
know
of
any
reason
offhand,
but
i
certainly
couldn't
say.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
i
think
there's--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well
i
believe
that
i've
seen
the
number
of
40,
i've
seen
the
number
of
75
different
pieces
of
litigation
which
called
for
the
possibility
of
attorneys
fees
as
being
imposed
in
certain
actions.
and
in
any
of
those,
yes,
i
would
say,
and
including
title
vii,
i
would
say
that
the
possibility
of
asking
for
attorneys
fees
as
part
of
costs
is
a
realistic
possibility.
in
the
case
at
hand,
the
district
court
denied
our
rule
68
motion,
saying
that
there
was
no
good
faith
attempt
to
settle
because
the
proposal
must
be
at
least
arguably
reasonable.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
rule
68
which
provides
that
type
of
condition.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
offer
made
exceeds
the
judgment
finally
received;
that,
by
definition
is
a
reasonable
offer
of
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
quoted
from
the
perkins
case,
stating
that
the
defendant
may
offer
what
is
really
due
and
put
the
burden
of
costs
on
the
plaintiff.
when
in
this
case
what
was
really
due
was
nothing
and
the
trial
court
found
and
said
that
it
had
no
difficulty
finding
that
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
nothing.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
$450.00--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--plus
costs.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
reaching
the
extreme,
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
but
i
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
application
of
the
rule
that
the
definition
of
what
is
reasonable
comes
in
the
end
result.
the
rule
says
that
if
the
offer
exceeds
that
which
is
received
then
the
rule
applies
and
the
mandatory
cross-shifting
applies.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well
it
included--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--no,
your
honor.
we
included
costs
other
than
attorneys
fees
because
we
said
the
$450
would
include
attorneys
fees.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
at
that
point
there
were
of
course
some
filing
fees
and
there
was
one,
i
believe,
one
deposition.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
whatever
costs
the
court
might
attribute
in
those,
would
include
the
additional
costs.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
it's
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
we
did...
we
did
very
much
question
the
inclusion
of
that
in
the
presentation
to
this
court.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
however,
that
the
value
of
the
attorney
services
in
an
action
such
as
this
could
have
been
on
a
contingent
basis
and
one-third
of
zero,
i
submit
is
zero.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
quite
possible,
your
honor;
that's
quite
possible.
and
it
is
possible
that
a
title
vii
counsel
knows
full
well
that
recovery
may
be
zero,
and
zero
attorneys
fees.
and
regardless
of
the
number
of
hours
put
in
the
matter,
that
at
that
point
the
attorney
certainly
has
a
right
to
determine,
along
with
his
or
her
client,
that
$450
will
suffice
to
cover
attorneys
fees
as
well
as
whatever
division
is
going
to
be
made
for
the
party
himself
or
herself.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
well
my
comment,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
would
be
that
that
certainly
is
one
of
the
situations
in
which
the
rule
would
apply.
that
under
most
state
laws,
not
all,
all
legal
actions...
the
prevailing
party
did
get
costs.
so
that
the
application
of
the
rule
would
not
be
required
where
the
plaintiff
was
victorious.
but
as
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
our
brief
review
of
the
later
title
vii
cases,
indicates
that
the
trial
courts
in
their
discretion
all
too
often
do
not
award
costs
to
a
prevailing
defendant
and
that
the
discretion
called
for
under
rule
54(d)
is
not
exercised
in
favor
of
the
prevailing
party
in
all
too
many
cases.
we
find--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--yes,
the
rule
says
of
course,
the
prevailing
party
should
receive
costs
except--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--yes.
and
to
that
extent
where
the
court
exercises
its
discretion
and
denies
the
costs
to
the
prevailing
party,
and
that
seems
to
be
happening
all
too
often
in
our
opinion,
in
title
vii
actions;
rule
68
has
an
even
greater
application
and
a
greater
need
for
defendants.
but
of
course,
in
state
actions,
both
before
and
since,
in
equitable
actions,
whether
they
were
for
money
alone
or
for
other
equitable
considerations
or
equitable
relief,
there
is
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
determining
where
costs
would
fall,
existed
both
before
and
after
the
rule.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
do
not.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
it
did
happen
routinely
and
if
that
meant
that
the
court
was
relieved
of
part
of
the
congestion
which
now
faces
it,
it
would
be
a
benefit
not
only
to
the
public
but
to
the
judiciary
as
well.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that
i
think
is
very
difficult
to
understand,
your
honor.
the...
and
it
may
very
well
be--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--or
it
may
well
be
that
they
relied
upon
the
courts,
the
federal
courts,
following
rule
54(d)
rather
than
exercising
discretion
and
denying
costs
to
the
prevailing
defendant.
and
only
now
seeing
that
that
discretion
has
been
exercised
more
and
more,
that
they
find
need
of
some
other
way
of
protecting
themselves
and
fortunately
have
found
rule
68.
we
have
submitted
and
we
believe
that
the
lower
courts
erred
in
at
least
three
respects.
we
believe
that
the
rule
is
clearly
mandatory,
that
the
word
must
means
must,
and
does
not
permit
or
allow
for
a
revision
or
a
rewriting
of
that
determination;
that
the
drafters
of
the
rules
made
it
quite
clear
when
they
wanted
to
use
the
word
may,
when
they
wanted
to
permit
discussion,
they
did
so,
with
clarity,
with
ease,
and
on
many,
many
occasions.
only
on
a
few
occasions
in
the
drafting
of
those
rules
did
they
use
the
word
must.
and
it
is
our
view
of
the
cases
that
in
all
of
those
cases
where
the
word
must
has
been
used
and
it
has
come
up
for
review,
must
has
been
construed
to
mean
just
that;
the
mandatory
term
of
must.
we
say
that
the
courts
below
attempted
to
rewrite
rule
68
and
we
submit
that
the
courts
below
had
no
such
authority.
and
finally,
we
submit
that
what
the
court
did,
below,
was
to
equate
rule
68
with
rule
54(d),
making
the
two
of
them
basically
the
same,
permitting
for
discretion
to
be
exercised
in
either
case.
we
noted
in
our
briefs
to
this
court
that
under
rule
54(d),
the
seventh
circuit
has
indicated
that
that
discretion
should
be
very
sparingly
exercised
and
that
there
should
be
a
clear
explication
as
to
why
costs
were
being
denied
a
prevailing
defendant
and
indicated
that
it
was
a
form
of
penalty.
and
we
felt
that
it
was
relevant
because
the
seventh
circuit
had
equated
the
two
rules
to
look
to
the
standards
that
that
court
itself
had
applied,
when
discretion
was
exercised
under
54(d)
and
denying
costs.
it
is
our
belief,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
is
clear
on
its
face.
that
it
does
not
permit
a
rewriting
or
a
conditioning,
and
we
note
in
that
respect
that
this
court
had
cause
to
look
at,
i
believe,
rule
23,
when
it
came
to
class
actions
and
it
said
in
the
eisen
case,
we're
not
going
to
rewrite
the
rules
for
certain
classes
of
plaintiffs
as
distinguished
from
others;
that
if
there
is
a
notice
provision,
the
notice
provision
applies
and
that
we
don't
look
to
the
pocketbook
of
the
plaintiffs
to
determine
whether
this
rule
is
going
to
apply
to
this
class
as
distinguished
from
that
class.
and
we
note
also,
in
the
general
telephone
case,
that
this
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
was
not
saying
that
the
rules
do
not
apply
to
eeoc
actions
and
title
vii
actions,
that
the...
that
all
it
was
saying
in
that
case
was
that
an
eeoc
action
was
not
a
class
action.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
because
to
put
a
good
faith
requirement
or
condition
into
it
seems
to
me,
to
leave
it
unclear
to
both
parties
as
to
what
has
happened;
there
is
no
clear
reason
why
a
plaintiff
should
realistically
assess
his
or
her
claim
at
that
point
and
know
full
well
that
there
is
still
a
determination
later
on
as
to
whether
somebody
determines
that
was
a
good
faith
offer
or
not.
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
moments,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
thank
you.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
frankly,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
i
will
require
all
of
the
time--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
we
were
unaware
of
it
until
today,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
it
was
not
my
understanding
that
it
was
available
as
a
matter
of
open
record,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
it
is,
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
public
record
as
to
what
the
fee
arrangements
are
between
clients
and...
i
frankly
was
unaware
of
it
until
counsel
announced
this
morning.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i'm
afraid
i'm
unacquainted
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
i
am
not
professing
surprise
that
there
was
a
contingent
arrangement
between
counsel
and
plaintiff,
i
assumed
that,
but
i
was
unaware
of
what
the
arrangement
was
until
this
morning.
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that
we
should
point
out
here
is
that
in
attempting
to
argue
that
rule
68
applies
only
where
the
plaintiff
prevails
ignores,
i
think,
two
things:
one,
the
language
of
the
rule
speaks
in
terms
of
obtaining
judgment,
and
judgment
under
the
rules
is
merely
defined
as
a
decree
in
any
order
from
which
an
appeal
lies.
a
judgment
may
be
for
someone,
a
judgment
may
be
against
someone,
but
all
parties
to
an
action
receive
that
judgment
at
the
end
of
the
case
from
which
judgment
they
may
appeal
if
they
so
desire.
i
see
nothing
in
the
rules
and
in
the
definition
of
the
term
judgment,
which
would
indicate
that
the
judgment
must
be
for
someone
or
the
judgment
must
be
against
someone
to
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
application
of
rule
68.
going
beyond
what
i
think
is
the
plain
meaning--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--i
think
the
only
other
place
that
the
word
obtain
is
used
in
the
rules,
to
my
knowledge,
is
in
rule
56
having
to
do
with
declaratory
judgments.
it's
my
understanding
that
a
party
may
seek
declaratory
judgment
in
his
favor
or
merely
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
so
as
he
or
she
knows
how
to
act
in
the
future.
so
that
in
that
respect,
obtaining
a
judgment
doesn't
necessarily
mean
for
or
against--
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
--to
obtain
a
judgment,
which
may
be
for
you
or
against
you,
it
is
a
judgment.
we
all
going
into
court
seek
a
judgment.
hopefully
it's
going
to
be
for
us.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
we
submit
that
the
offer
specifically
did
include
costs.
we
said,
as
i
recall,
$450
which
shall
include
attorneys
fees
together
with
all
costs
accrued
to
date.
we
believe
that
we
followed
the
wording
of
the
rule
specifically.
we
did,
however,
say
that
the
one
element,
the
potential
element
of
cost
which
a
court
may
include
in
its
discretion
under
706(k),
namely,
attorneys
fees,
be
a
determined
portion
determined
by
the
plaintiffs
themselves,
of
the
$450
offered.
mr.
e.
allan
kovar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
there
were
a
contingency
arrangement
in
effect
then,
and
that
was
a
one-third
basis,
then
the
plaintiff
would
have
said
to
plaintiff's
counsel,
all
right,
you
are
entitled
to
one-third
of
that
under
our
fee
arrangement.
i
think,
going
beyond
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
it
simply
is
absurd
in
my
opinion
to
say
that
a
defendant
who
is
totally
innocent
has
no
right
to
the
application
of
rule
68.
counsel,
on
several
occasions,
counsel
for
plaintiff
has
made
the
point
that
what
we
are
seeking
is
security
in
knowing
that
our
costs
are
going
to
be
covered.
why
indeed
not,
if
we
know
that
we
are
completely
innocent?
why
indeed
not,
if
the
trial
court
found
as
it
did,
with
no
trouble
whatsoever,
that
we
were
indeed
innocent?
why
shouldn't
we
have
security
in
knowing
in
that
situation
that
our
costs
will
be
covered?
that
is
what
we
are
seeking;
that
we
believe
is
justice,
and
certainly
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
speedier,
certainly
in
this
case
it
would
have
been
less
expensive.
the
seventh
circuit
introduced
the
element
of
discretion.
that
took
away
any
possibility
of
certainty
in
making
an
offer
of
judgment,
one
wouldn't
have
the
faintest
idea
whether
it
was
going
to
prevail
or
not,
because
it
would
depend
upon
subsequent
court
determination
as
to
reasonableness
or
good
faith
or
genuineness.
if
we
know
for
a
certainty
that
our
offer
will
protect
us,
if
that
offer
is
greater
than
the
judgment
ultimately
prevailed,
an
innocent
defendant
has
some
protection
under
the
rules
which
under
plaintiff's
contentions,
would
not
obtain.
we
say,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
as
we
construe
it,
does
consistently
apply
with
rule
54(d)
and
does
completely
fulfill
the
requirements
of
rule
1.
thank
you,
sir.
