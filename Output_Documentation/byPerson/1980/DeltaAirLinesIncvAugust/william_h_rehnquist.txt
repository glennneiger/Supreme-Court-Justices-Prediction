justice
rehnquist
well
and
also,
i
take
it,
if
this
were
not
a
title
vii
action,
but
simply
a
personal
injury
action,
and
not
a
contingent
fee
action,
an
attorney
could
have
put
in
1,000
hours,
thinking
that
he
had
a
real
blockbuster
of
a
lawsuit
and
declined
your
tender,
and
gotten
a
defense
verdict
from
the
jury.
justice
rehnquist
but
your
proceeding
is
an
action
in
the
federal
courts,
is
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
so
how
do
you
get
around
the
provision
of
rule
1,
that
these
rules
shall
apply
to
all
suits
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
if
this
had
been
an
anti-trust
case,
that
took
you
exactly
the
same
amount
of
time,
25
days,
and
it
consumed
exactly
the
amount
of
time
in
attorneys
fees?
would
you
say
there
that
rule
68
didn't
apply?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
a
take
nothing
judgment
then
is
not
a
judgment
less
favorable?
justice
rehnquist
but
would
it
make
any
sense,
so
far
as
the
drafters
of
rule
68
are
concerned,
to
say
that
if
the
plaintiff
prays
for
$10,000
in
damages
and
gets
only
$8,000
in
damages
and
has
been
offered
that
amount
previously,
then
the
defendant
gets
costs;
but
if
the
plaintiff
gets
nothing,
the
defendant
is
not
allowed
costs?
justice
rehnquist
well
then
why
do
you
need
rule
54,
if
rule
68
is
interpreted
the
way
you
say
it
should
be?
justice
rehnquist
but
rule
54
allows
the
district
court
to
disallow
costs
to
the
prevailing
party
in
its
discretion.
justice
rehnquist
so
without
68
at
all,
the
district
court
could
have
disallowed
costs
here,
if...
finding
that
the
prevailing
party
for
any
number
of
reasons,
was
not
entitled
to
them.
justice
rehnquist
well
if
there's...
suppose
this
is
a
class
action
and
there
are
100
thousand
people
in
the
class,
an
offer
of
a
penny
to
each
of
those
100
thousand
people
is
not
an
insubstantial
amount
of
money.
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
stillman,
why
do
you
need
rule
54(d)
if
your
explanation
of
rule
68
is
correct?
justice
rehnquist
why
did
the
drafters
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
speak
in
rule
54(d)
that
the
prevailing
party
shall
be
awarded
his
costs
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs,
if
your
interpretation
of
rule
68
is
correct?
justice
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
rule
54(d)
cover
the
waterfront,
so
to
speak,
if
you
are
right?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
on
the
assumption
that
the
plaintiff...
that
68
is
limited
to
the
cases
where
the
plaintiff
has
won
something,
but
not
all.
justice
rehnquist
if
you're
wrong
on
that
assumption,
that
doesn't
explain
why
54(d)
doesn't
cover
everything.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
can't
be
sure
that
the
costs
that
the
parties
arranged
between
themselves
as
to
attorneys
fees
would
be
awarded
by
the
court?
justice
rehnquist
supposing
someone
comes
in
and
pays
a
$25,000
retainer
to
a
lawyer
to
represent
him
in
a
case,
and
the
lawyer
says
yes,
i'll
file
your
complaint,--
justice
rehnquist
--and
there's
a
tender
offer
of
$20,000
and
the
defense
says
well
i
already
paid
$25,000
to
my
lawyer
and
i...
i'm
entitled
to
recover
attorneys
fees.
that
doesn't
mean
you
would
be
entitled
to
recover
$25,000,
does
it?
