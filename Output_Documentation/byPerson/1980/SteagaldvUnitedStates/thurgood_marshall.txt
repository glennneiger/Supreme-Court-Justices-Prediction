justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know,
i
have
to
raise
the
point
that,
i
have
been
listening
carefully
but
i
have
great
difficulty
in
putting
all
this
together
until
i
find
out
on
what
basis
you
say
that
that's
his
home,
emphasis
his
underscored.
justice
thurgood
marshall
also,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
had
privacy
in
one
room
in
that
house?
isn't
that
what
i
understand
you
to
be
saying?
you
said
somebody
was
sleeping
in
one
room--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
he...
or
do
you
say
he
had
privacy
in
the
whole
house?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
go
for
an
apartment,
too?
how
about
a
rooming
house
with
18
rooms?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
must
have
missed
it.
where
was
the
dope
found?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
why
they
say
it
was
his
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
it
was
all
found
in
his
room.
it
was
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
any
found
in
his
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
does
that
mean
that
all
of
them
are
his?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
none
of
them
are
his?
does
the
failure
of
the
record
to
show
that
all
of
the
house
was
his
or
none
of
the
house
was
his?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
government
says
for
that
reason
he
doesn't
have
any?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
do
we
do,
toss
a
coin?
justice
marshall
but
mr.
frey,
you
aren't
abandoning
the
point
that
it
wasn't
litigated,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
abandoning
that,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
raised
it
when
you
started
your
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
see.
oh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
a
question?
assuming
i
owned
a
home
in
atlanta,
you
could
use
that
warrant
to
break
into
my
house
tonight?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
i
owned
a
home
in
atlanta,
georgia,--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--could
you
use
this
very
same
warrant
and
break
into
my
house?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
police
said
that,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
to
have
that--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--you
could
break
into
my
house?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
get
hurt
that
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
under
a
general
warrant,
it
does
give
them
the
right
to
go
into
any
premises
that
he...
which
means
any
officer
in
atlanta,
assumes
or
has
reasonable
belief
that
that
man
is
in
there...
he
makes
the
decision
as
to
the
house
that
will
be
searched,
not
the
magistrate.
i
think--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
think
that's
the
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
real
injury
comes
in
going
into
the
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
don't
read
that
any
place
in
the
fourth
amendment,
that,
you
know,
these
things
don't
usually
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
still
haven't...
you
admit
that
the
official,
the
police
official
individually
makes
a
decision
as
to
which
house
he's
going
to
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
any...
without
any
supervision
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
narcotic
offenses
on
the
basis
of
evidence
uncovered
during
the
search
of
his
residence
for
a
federal
fugitive.
in
the
courts
below,
petitioner
argued
that
the
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
was
conducted
without
a
search
warrant.
the
court
of
appeals
objected
this
contention
concluding
that
the
officers
who
conducted
the
search
were
not
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
because
they
had
an
arrest
warrant
for
the
same
fugitive
and
reasonably
believed
that
this
fugitive
might
be
a
guest
in
petitioner's
home.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
the
fourth
amendment
generally
prohibits
the
search
of
a
home
without
a
warrant.
the
arrest
warrant
possessed
by
the
officers
in
this
case
did
not
satisfy
this
requirement.
it
addressed
only
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
fugitive
and
therefore
did
not
consider
the
essential
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
fugitive
was
located
in
petitioner's
home.
the
warrant
does
fail
to
protect
petitioner's
fourth
amendment
right
to
be
secure
in
his
home
from
a
forcible
and
unjustified
intrusion
by
the
government.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
white
joins.
