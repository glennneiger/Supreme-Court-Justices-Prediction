justice
blackmun
it
was
his
house,
is
that
fixed
in
the
record?
justice
blackmun
it
really
was
the
gaultney's
place
of
residence,

it?
justice
blackmun
i
think
we'd
all
feel
better
if
you'd
call
it
the
home,
rather
than
his,
because
that
issue
is
still--
justice
blackmun

in
that
connection,
how
far
is
buford,
george,
from
atlanta;
it's
a
number
of
miles,
isn't
it?
