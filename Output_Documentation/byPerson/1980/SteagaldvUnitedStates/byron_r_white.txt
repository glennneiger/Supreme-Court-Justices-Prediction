r.
white
well,
you
know
we're
not
required
to
consider
it
under
our
cases,
don't
you?
justice
white
well,
we've
considered
some,
but
we've
never,
nobody's
ever
suggested
we
had
to.
justice
white
but
that
falls
considerably
short
of
saying
that
the
court
has
to
consider--
justice
white
--as
to
whether
you're
entitled
to
raise
it?
justice
white
mr.
fray,
you're
spending
a
lot
of
time
on
a
point
on
which...
we
granted
cert
on
another
point.
justice
white
well
the
one
that
it...
the
question
you're
arguing
now
is
a
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
justice
white
what,
about
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply
in
this
case?
justice
white
what
if
we
found
that
one
tougher
than
the
other
one?
i
don't
know
why
we
couldn't
reach
the
other
one.
justice
white
well
your
time
is
certainly
running
fast.
