mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
three
distinct
issues
to
the
court:
the
first
is
whether
petitioner's
legitimate
expectations
of
privacy
were
implicated
by
the
entry
into
the
cabin
so
that
he
is
entitled
to
raise
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue.
the
second
is
whether
the
court
should
decline
to
consider
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
exclusionary
rule,
and
retroactivity
policy.
and
the
third,
if
the
court
reaches
the
issue,
is
whether
an
arrest
warrant
plus
reason
to
believe
or
probable
cause
to
believe
the
subject
of
the
warrant
is
on
the
premises
suffices
to
justify
an
entry
into
third
party
premises
to
execute
the
arrest
warrant.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
treat
these
issues
in
the
order
i
have
listed
them.
first,
with
respect
to
what
i
hope
justice
rehnquist
will
give
me
the
liberty
of
calling
the
standing
issue,
this
is
essentially
offered
to
this
court
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance.
we
do
not
in
fact
suggest
affirmance
on
this
ground,
although
we
think
the
record
would
permit
it,
but,
in
light
of
what
the
court
did
in
combs
and
what
the
court
did
last
term
in
salvucci,
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
focus
on
the
issue
of
petitioner's
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
cabin,
we
think
fairness
would
justify
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
on
a
remand.
however--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
first
of
all
that
we
do
not
contend
that
the
issue
is
jurisdictional.
this
is
not
standing
in
the
constitutional
case
or
controversy
sense,
so
we
do
not
say
that
the
court
is
required
to
consider
the
issue
on
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--now,
there
are
two
separate
questions:
one
is,
are
we
entitled
to
raise
it
in
this
court;
and
the
second
question
is,
if
we
are
entitled
to
raise
it,
must
the
court
consider
it?
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
must
consider
it,
but
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
not...
i
have
found
the
cases
somewhat
confusing,
but
i
will--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--let
me
just
cite
the
court
three
cases
in
which
points
which
are
pertinent
to
this
are
made,
quite
briefly.
in
the
new
york
telephone
company
case,
434
u.s.
at
166,
note
a,
the
court
said
the
prevailing
party
may
defend
the
judgment
on
any
ground
which
the
law
and
the
record
permit,
that
would
not
expand
the
relief
that
has
been
granted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
was
interested
to
find,
in
looking
at
it,
that
it
is
not
ordinarily
so
qualified.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
now
answering
justice
brennan's
question--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--whether
we're
entitled
to
raise
it.
in
dandridge
against
williams,
the
court
said
the
prevailing
party
may
of
course
assert
in
a
reviewing
court,
any
ground
in
support
of
his
judgment,
whether
or
not
that
ground
was
relied
upon
or
even
considered
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
that's
all...
this
would
be
a
ground
for
affirming
the
conviction
and
a
denial
of
the
suppression
motion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
let
me
get
to
that
in
a
second.
if
i
can
just
mention
the
third
case,
which
is
bondholders
committee
against
commissioner,
315
u.s.,
and
this
is
at
192,
the
court
said
that
though
respondent
apparently
did
not
urge
this
point
before
the
board
or
the
court
below,
it
may
of
course
support
the
judgment
here
by
any
matter
appearing
in
the
record.
now,
our
position,
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
that
this
record
contains
no
evidence
sufficient
to
support...
for
the
petitioner
to
carry
his
burden
of
demonstrating
that
he
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
cabin.
we're
of
course
not
saying
that
he
was
a
trespasser
on
the
premises;
what
we
are
saying
is
that
he
was
outside
at
the
time
the
entry
was
made,
there
is
no
indication
other
than
counsel's
surmise,
nothing
in
the
record
that
he
lived
in
the
cabin,
he
was
not
the
lessee--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
there
are
indications,
including
the
cocaine,
that
he
was
present--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
that
evidence.
but--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--this
is
an
issue
that
has
been
raised,
we
filed
a
petition
last
year
in
a
case
called
conway,
which
was
sent
back
after
rawlings
and
salvucci
were
decided.
an
individual
may
have
possession
of
items
that
are
found
in
a
premises
or
in
a
suitcase
or
in
a
place
sufficient
that
he
can
be
criminally
responsible
if
the
item
is
contraband,
without
having
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
place
where
they
are
located.
if
you
go
into
a
public
restaurant...
obviously--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well
i
would
say
that
on
this--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--as
part
of
the
evidence,
there
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
but
we
don't
deny
that
mr.
steagald
was
ever
in
the
cabin,
or
that
he
did
not
have
some
kind
of
guest
connection
with
the
cabin.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
believe
he
could
use
this
evidence
if
there
were
a
remand
hearing.
i'm
not
saying...
what
i
am
saying,
however,
is
that
he
has
the
burden
on
this
issue,
of
coming
forward...
which
he
did
not
do--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
believe,
i
would
disagree
with
such
a
holding
by
the
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
are
evidence
that
would
be
relevant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
could.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
wasn't...
it
was
not
litigated--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
we
are
charged
with--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--having
failed
to
raise
the
point
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
our
response,
first,
is
that
it
was
petitioner's
burden
to
come
forward
on
this
issue
in
the
district
court
and
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
this
was...
it's
rather
peculiar
to
charge
us
with
waiving,
when
he
has
failed
to
meet
his
burden
of
coming
forward,
or
his
burden
of--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we
didn't,
until...
we
did
not
understand
the
pertinent
facts
until
we
reviewed
the
record
in
connection
with
preparing
the
brief
on
the
merits.
but
i
will
be
happy,
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
on
this
point,
to
move
on
to
the
second
issue.
and
although
the
second
issue
is
not
one
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari,
i
believe
it
is
one
that
the
court
must
consider
and
if
it
determines
the
issue
in
our
favor
it
will
not
and
should
not
reach
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue.
now
petitioner's
argument
essentially,
is
that
we
are
making
some
kind
of
general
good
faith
argument
here,
and
that
there
is
some
doubt,
at
least
in
petitioner's
mind,
that
the
arresting
officers
were
acting
in
subjective
good
faith.
i
think
he
misapprehends
our
argument
in
this
case.
he
does
not
dispute
and
he
can't,
because
certiorari
was
denied
on
the
second
question
presented
in
the
petition,
that
the
agents'
action
was
supported,
they
had
the
necessary
quantum
of
suspicion
to
believe
that
ricky
lyons
was
in
the
cabin,
and
under
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
cravero
case...
and
i
might
note,
incidentally,
that
we
acquiesced
when
certiorari
was
sought
in
that
case,
because
we
believed
it
presented
a
significant
issue,
and
the
court
denied
certiorari,
subsequent
to
that
time
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
point
was
about
as
settled
as
the
law
could
be
unless
this
court
were
to
do
something
to
unsettle
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'll
take
your
word
for
it,
i'm
not
aware--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--now
petitioner
does
not
dispute
that
payton
itself,
which
our
argument
heavily
relies
on
the
fact
that
payton
was
decided...
he
does
not
dispute
that
payton
is
a
case
that
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
arrest
entries
into
the
defendant's
or
suspect's
own
premises,
and
i
don't
think
i
need
to
belabor
the
point,
payton
clearly
altered
the
settled
law
of
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
payton
issue
and
the
opinion
itself
in
payton
stated
that
the
practice
that
it
was
overturning
was
a
longstanding
and
widespread
practice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
will
come
to
that
point,
because
we
have
tried
to
be
careful
not
to
argue
that
and
i
will
explain
that
point.
the
complication
in
this
case
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue
presented
here,
while
closely
related
to
the
issues
presented
in
payton,
nevertheless
is
not
clearly
controlled
by
it.
that
is,
it
is
still
possible
that
the
government
could
win
this
case
even
though
the
state
lost
payton.
now,
this
fact,
standing
alone,
does
not
justify
reaching
the
issue
in
the
case
of
a
search
that
took
place
prior
to
the
decision
in
payton.
to
do
that
would
be
to
do
the
very
thing
that
this
court
criticized
the
court
of
appeals
for
doing
in
the
bowen
case.
and
the
very
thing
that
this
court
declined
to
do
in
stovall
and
destefano
and
in
payne...
that
is,
to
consider
in
the
context,
having
determined
that
a
decision
is
not
retroactive,
to
go
on
and
consider
a
ramification
of
that
decision.
that
is
not
appropriate
and
the
court
in
bowen,
suggested
that
several
reasons
why
the
practice
would
not
be
done,
including
the
court's
reluctance
to
decide
constitutional
issues
unnecessarily.
now,
let
me
acknowledge
that
this
case
is
different
from
those
other
cases
in
one
respect:
in
bowen,
if
the
government
had
won
almeida-sanchez,
bowen
would
have
had
no
claim
whatsoever,
his
claim
was
a
lesser
included
claim
than
had
been
almeida-sanchez's
claim...
the
same
is
true
of
almost
all
of
those
other
cases,
although
with
one
exception
that
i'll
get
to
in
a
moment.
here
it
is
possible
that
the
state
could
have
won
payton,
i
believe,
and
that
the
courts
could
nevertheless
have
concluded
that
petitioner's
position
on
the
issue
of
third
party
entries
is
sound.
now
petitioner's
argument
in
his
reply
brief
is
that...
and
it's
the
point
that
you
were
making
about
payton...
that
if
the
government
is
simply
making
a
good
faith
argument,
then
the
court
will
never
decide
the
issue
that
the
police
officers,
and
the
drug
enforcement
administration
agents
and
so
on
and
the
fifth
circuit,
will
continually
be
able
to
point
to
the
cravero
decision
and
the
court
will
continually,
as
he
construes
our
argument,
be
forced
to
say,
although
it's
a
matter
of
exclusionary
rule
policy,
we
won't
reach
the
substantive
constitutional
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
believe,
though
that
as
a
matter
of
logical
precedence,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
will
argue
the
other
point
now,
if
the
court
prefers,
but
as
a
matter
of
logical
precedence,
the
question
is
whether...
it
is
a
preliminary
question
whether
you
should
reach
the
question
on
which
you
granted--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
let
me
just
make
this
point
and
then
i
will
move
on
to
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue.
it
is
clear
from
bowen,
that
if
payton
is
not
retroactive,
you
should
not
undertake
to
decide
the
issue
on
which
the
court
granted
this
case.
in
payton,
the
state
made
a
good
faith
argument
and
the
court
implicitly,
i
suppose,
rejected
it,
at
least
it
did
not
advert
to
it
in
its
opinion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
question
i
am
arguing
now
is
a
jurisprudential
question.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
constitutional.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
this
is...
yes,
our
argument
is
an
argument
that,
as
the
court
has
explained
the
workings
of
the
exclusionary
rule--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
what
you
said
in
bowen
was
that,
and
what
you
said
in
destefano
and
what
you
said
in
payne
and
what
you
said
in
stovall
is
that
you
would
not
do
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
mr.
justice
stevens
understood
my
response
to
his
point.
it
is
the
very
decision
in
payton
that
changes
the
law.
that
is,
in
payton
the
court
was
able
to
say
we
must
reach
the
fourth
amendment
issue,
otherwise
the
police
will
constantly
be
simply
relying
on
the
new
york
statutes
and
we'll
never
decide
the
issue.
here,
because
of
the
intervening
decision
in
payton,
cravero
is
not
a
precedent
that
can
any
longer
be
relied
upon
in
post-payton
cases.
and
therefore,
is
a
break
in
the
fabric
of
fourth
amendment
arrest
entry
law,
and
therefore,
pre-payton
searches...
claims
like
this
should
not
be
considered.
now,
i
will
move
on
at
this
point
to
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue,
even
though
we
do
believe
it
would
not
be
proper
for
the
court
to
reach
it.
we
agree
that
it
is
a
close
issue,
that
there
is
much
logic
to
the
petitioner's
position.
nevertheless,
we
think
there
are
significant
considerations
that
weigh
in
the
other
direction.
the
first
consideration
is
history.
now,
i...
in
its
reply
brief,
petitioner
did
not
dispute
our
historical
argument,
and
i'm
sure
the
law
clerks
can
do
much
better
than
i
can
in
the
time
available,
in
digging
into
these...
the
esoteric
of
it.
if
you
will
look
at
the
passage
or
coke
that
we
cite,
you
will
see
that
the
discussion
is
talking
about
any
man's
house,
or
the
house
of
any
person,
and
it
is
not,
i
think,
contemplating
simply
the
house
of
the
subject
of
the
warrant.
and
coke
does
say,...
it's
an
authority
that
was
greatly
relied
on
by
the
court
in
payton...
that,
at
least
after
indictment,
and
this
case
was
a
warrant
issued
after
indictment,
the
arrest
warrant
does
constitute
authority
to
break
into
any
man's
home.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
subject
of
the
warrant
was
present
in
the
house.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
police
had
that
reason
to
believe.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
had
to
have
it,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
just,
i'd
like
to
pass
on
from
the
history
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
well,--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
of
course
not.
we're
not
relying
on
semayne's
case
for
every
possible
implication
that
could
conceivably
be
dredged
out.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean,
why
wouldn't...
if
semayne's
case
were
the
history--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
would
be
the
substance
of
my
argument
as
to
whether
they
should
or
they
shouldn't.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
as
to
the
role
of
history,
of
course,
there's
much
room
for
debate
about
what
role
history
ought
to
play
in
a
decision
of
this
sort,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
limit
beyond
which
the
fourth
amendment
ought
not
to
be
construed
to
bar
practices
that
were
clearly
permissible
in
common
law,
but
this
is
a
case
which
i
concede
is
not
as
clear
as
watson
was,
let's
say,
on
the
history.
now
laying
this
point
aside
and
considering
the
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
logic
and
policy,
the
argument
is
not
all
one-sided.
now,
we
grant
that
there
will
be
some
cases
in
which
a
search
warrant
requirement
would
be
useful
in
interposing
a
magistrate
and
preventing
overzealous
police
officers
from
unreasonably
invading
third
party
premises.
but
the
issue
must
be
placed
in
context.
because
we
are
talking
about
third
party
premises
and
not
the
residence
of
the
individual
named
in
the
warrant,
we
are
dealing
with
a
class
of
cases
in
which,
by
definition,
the
connection
of
the
suspect
to
the
premises
is
likely
to
be
brief
or
transitory.
accordingly,
a
much
higher
proportion
of
this
class
of
cases
will
involve
exigent
circumstances
or
at
least
circumstances
in
which
recourse
to
the
warrant
procedure
with
the
delays
it
often
entails,
will
render
the
information
regarding
the
presence
of
the
subject
on
the
premises
stale.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
benefits
that
we
may
reasonably
expect
to
reap
from
the
imposition
of
a
search
warrant
requirement,
are
considerably
diminished
as
against
those
which
could
have
been
anticipated
from
the
decision
in
payton.
with
the
weight
on
one
side
of
the
scale
thus
diminished,
it
seems
to
us
questionable
conclusion
that
an
arrest
entry
by
officers
armed
with
an
arrest
warrant
and
possessing
sufficient
reason
to
believe
the
subject
of
the
warrant
is
on
the
premises,
is
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
unless
they
also
possess
a
search
warrant.
now
let
me
summarize
the
factors
that
favor
continued
adherence
to
the
common
law
rule
that
an
arrest
warrant
suffices
to
enter
any
premises
in
which
the
suspect
is
reasonably
believed
to
be
located.
first,
the
arrest
warrant
means
that
the
magistrate
has
determined
one
of
the
elements
required
to
be
determined
by
the
warrant
clause;
that
is,
he
has
determined
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
seize
the
person
named
in
the
arrest
warrant.
we
concede
of
course
that
he
has
not
determined
that
the
person
named
in
the
arrest
warrant
is
on
the
premises
to
which
entry
is
to
be
made.
and
i
think
that
the
case
is
weaker
than
payton,
that
is,
payton's
conclusion
that
an
arrest
warrant
sufficed
to
enter
into
the
premises
of
the
individual
named
in
the
arrest
warrant,
rests
on
stronger
grounds
because
of
the
greater
likelihood
that
the
individual
will
in
fact
be
on
his
premises,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
no
general
warrant
problems
associated
with
treating
the
arrest
warrant
as
a
power
to
enter
into
premises--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--he
makes
the
original
decision,
but
of
course,
he
must
have
this
reason
to
believe,
the
decision
is
subject
to
a
post-entry
judicial
scrutiny
in
connection
either
with
a
suppression
hearing
or
a
civil
damages
suit,
this
is
not
simply
the
uncontrolled
discretion
of
the
officer.
now,
i
understand,
and
i
could
hardly
argue
otherwise,
that
all
of
the
court's
warrant
clause
cases
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
value
in
having
the
magistrate
look
at
the
matter.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
class--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
most
of
the
cases
that
are
going
to
happen
where
this...
where
the
subject
of
an
arrest
warrant
is
on
third
party
premises,
his
stay
is
going
to
be
brief,
there
will
usually
be
exigent
circumstances,
the
warrant
requirement
will
usually,
i
think,
not
apply.
now,
of
course
there
are
cases,
and
perhaps
this
is
one--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well
but
what
the
court
is
doing,
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--individually
or
collectively.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
position
would
be
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
him
to
submit
the
question
whether
the
individual
is
in
the
house
to
the
magistrate
in
advance
of
entering
the
house.
that
is
our
position.
now
as
i
said,
we're
not
saying
that
there
is
no
value
to
having
a
magistrate
interpose;
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you
have
the
factor
of
history
which
weighs
more
strongly
on
our
side
in
this
case
than
it
did
in
payton,
and
you
have
the
fact
that
in
this
class
of
cases,
after
all
what
we're
doing
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
policy-making
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
is
weighing
the
costs
to
legitimate
societal
interests
and
law
enforcement
against
the
protection
of
equally
significant
individual
privacy
interests.
and
then
in
engaging
in
that
balancing
endeavor,
the
court
has
normally
preferred
a
warrant
and
normally,
i
think
there
have
been
substantial
reasons.
but
our
suggestion
is
that
in
this
area,
the
reasons
are
reduced;
the
benefits
that
will
be
derived
from
a
warrant
requirement
are
diminished.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
because
i
think
there
are
only
two
situations--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
if
in
the
normal
situation,
if
the
officers
learn
that
ricky
lyons
has
just
gone
into
an
apartment
at
such
and
such
a
place,
and
they
go
out
there
with
sirens--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--blasting,
and
that
would
probably
be
exigent
circumstances.
if
there
are
not,
i
mean
the
gravamen
of
the
argument
here
is
that
while
they
had
a
couple
of
days
to
track
things
down,
and
presumably
they
therefore
would
be
able
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--in
non-exigent
cases,
to
describe
the
premises,
yes.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
a
problem.
but
i
do
think
that
the
points
that
mr.
justice
white
made
in
his
dissent,
in
payton,
carried
perhaps
more
force
although
they
were
not
persuasive
to
a
majority
of
the
court
in
payton...
they
are
carrying
more
force
here,
because
of
this
difference
in
the
balance.
the
intrusion
that's
entailed
in
an
arrest
entry,
while
significant,
is
still
very
much
less
substantial
than
the
intrusion
that
is
entailed
in
an
entry
to
seize
books
or
records,
to
search
for
narcotics
or
other
kinds
of
things
that
would
involve
rummaging
through
papers,
desk
drawers,
and
other
customary
repositories
of
privacy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
not.
and
finally,
i
think
that
justice
white
expressed
in
his
dissent
in
payton,
a
concern
about
the
difficulty
of
having
the
police
make
this
very,
often
very
subtle
judgment
about
what
constitutes
exigent
circumstances,
and
he
suggested
that
the
common
law
rule
that
he
and
those
who
joined
with
him,
thought
should
be
retained,
was
an
easier
rule
for
the
police
to
administer.
now,
that
may
not
have
been
sufficiently
persuasive
in
the
context
of
payton,
because
after
all,
in
payton
there
had
not
even
been
any
determination
that
the
individual
who
the
officers...
any
magisterial
determination
that
the
individual
who
the
officers
were
seeking
was
in
fact
subject
to
arrest.
there
hadn't
been...
essentially
no
recourse
to
the
magistrate
in
payton,
those
consideration
were
found
unpersuasive.
but
in
this
case,
there
has
been
both
partial
recourse
to
the
magistrate
and
the
police--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
agree
that
the
right
is
implied
as
a
right
to
go
in--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am
not
suggesting--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
understand
that.
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
gives
me
concern.
i
mean,
i
think
we
have
indicated
and
acknowledged
in
our
brief
that
this
is
an
area
of
concern,
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
some
potential
for
police
abuse,
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
some
utility...
although
i'm
not
sure
how
much...
in
having
them
go
to
the
magistrate,
but
i
think
that
a
few
instances
of
improper
police
conduct
could
be
avoided
by
a
warrant
requirement.
on
the
other
hand,
it
puts
the
police
in
an
extremely
difficult
position,
and
we
are
suggesting
that
the
protections,
the
common
law
protections
and
the
protections
of
post-entry--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
in
this
case,
by
the
time
they--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not
sure
whether
they
left
from
the
atlanta
courthouse--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--in
this
case
of
course,
they
did
not
get
a
warrant
because
they
thought
that
the
arrest
warrant
was
sufficient
and
the
testimony
in
the
portion
of
the
transcript
that
we've
appended
to
our
brief
shows
that
the
agent
says,
you
know,
a
search
warrant...
why
i
had
an
arrest
warrant--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think,
i
gather
that
it's
some
distance.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
prospect
of
house
arrest,
of
all
the
occupants
of
the
house,
as
a
satisfactory
alternative
to
entry
is
not
a
very
appealing
one.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
exposes
a
lot
people
to
more
danger
and
arguably
involves
a
greater
imposition
on
the
people
surround
the
place
with
12
officers
while
somebody
gets
a
warrant.
now,
i
don't
want
to
exaggerate
the
difficulty
of
getting
a
warrant.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
at
least
for
the
federal
government
with
telephonic
warrant
procedures,
it
is
something
that
is
not
altogether
infeasible.
but
still,
i
do
want
to
stress
that
the
officers
are
left
with
some
very
difficult
legal
judgments
to
make,
are
there
exigent
circumstances
in
this
particular
case,
or
will
my
arrest
warrant
do?
whose
residence
is
this?
is
this
the
residence
of
the
person
subject
of
the
arrest
warrant,
or
is
this
the
residence
of
some
third
party?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
the
cost...
i'm
not
thinking
of
the
cost
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
so
much
as
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--cost
in
terms
of
the
police
having
clear
guidelines
as
to
how
they
ought
to
comport
themselves
to
comply
with
the
constitution,
and
also
the
cost
of
adding
to
the
warrant
procedure
a
whole
group
of
additional
warrant
applications
of
much
lesser
utility
which
may,
in
some
way,
dilute
or
diminish
the
seriousness
of
the
warrant
application
procedure
itself.
thank
you.
