justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
young,
on
the...
i
don't
want
you
to
go
into
the
facts
in
great
detail,
but
you
indicated
before
that
the
proof
of
the
substantive
offense
itself
was
largely
circumstantial.
was
the...
steagald's
connection
with
the
place
in
which
a
lot
of
these
things
were
found,
one
of
the
circumstances
on
which
the
government
relied
to
establish
guilt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
young,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
first,
is
it
correct
that
the
reasonable
belief
standard
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
same
as
the
probable
cause
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
read
that.
that
to
me,
implies
that
they
had
to
have
what
would
have
been
necessary
to
convince
the
magistrate.
yes.
which
would
have
been
probable
cause;
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
to
go
to
the
magistrate
with
something
less
than
probable
cause,
because
you
wouldn't
get
the
search
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
you'd
make
the
same
basic
argument
even
if
it
were
the
same,
though,
i
take
it,
that
there's
still
a
warrant
required?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
basic
argument,
the
government
says
that
the
common
law
is
against
you,
and
i
don't
think
you
respond
to
that;
do
you
concede
they
correctly
interpret
the
common
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
frey,
you'd
really
get
a
different
judgment,
wouldn't
you,
if
you
sent
it
back
for
further
hearing
in
the
trial
court;
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
the
proper
disposition
would
be
to
send
it
back
for
another
hearing
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
establish--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
raise
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition,
either,
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
frey,
in
this
argument
are
you
essentially
arguing
that
in
the
payton
case
we
should
have
not
applied
the
payton
rule
to
payton?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
let
me
ask
you
one
question
on
the
history,
because
it
really
carries
right
down
to
date.
the
quotation
from
semayne
that
you
have
on
page
38
of
your
brief,
says
the
house
of
anyone
is
not
a
castle
or
privilege,
but
for
himself,
and
shall
not
extend
to
protect
any
person
who
flies
to
his
house
or
the
goods
of
any
other
which
are
brought
and
conveyed
into
his
house.
now
does
your...
would
your
position
apply
also
to
going
into
getting
a
gun,
say,
that
the
suspect--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let's
say
you
had
a
search
warrant
for
the
gun
in
the
owner's
house,
and
also
an
arrest
warrant
for
the
owner,
and
he
takes
his
gun
to
the
house
but
he's
not
there;
can
you
break
in
to
get
the
gun?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
and
if
you
had
the
arrest...
if
you
had
the
search
warrant
and
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
gun
is
there,
why
doesn't
the
reasoning...
why
wouldn't
your
reasoning
apply
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
forget
semayne's
case.
just
should
there
would
be
a
distinction
between
the...
a
search
for
a
person
and
search
for
property
in
terms
of
breaking
into
a
third
party's
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
frey,
this
case
is
complicated
because...
everybody's
sort
of...
relies
with
one
another,
but
say
you
had
a
total
stranger
third
party,
who
didn't
have,
any
connection
whatsoever
remote
or
otherwise
with
the
criminal
conduct
itself,
and
i
take
it
your
position
is
that...
that
that
makes
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
the
intrusion.
you
could
break
down
the
doors
and
bust
in,
just
to
be
sure
you
catch
the
man
who
is
there.
there's
no...
the
intrusion
could
be
very,
under
your
view,
i'm
not
saying
it
always
would
be,
but
there's
no
question
of
knocking
on
the
door
and
asking
leave
to
go
in,
you
say
you
have
a
right
to
bust
in?
justice
stevens
now
it
could
be
a
serious
intrusion,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
always
would
be,
but
on
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
frey,
the
cost
really,
it
doesn't
really
affect
the
prosecution
of
the
person
they
are
seeking.
and
the
only
thing
that
you
lose
is
the
right
to
use
evidence
you
just
stumble
across
and
happened
to
be
in
the
possession
of
this
homeowner
that
you
didn't
suspect
a
crime
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
a
mistake
is
made,
you
know.
