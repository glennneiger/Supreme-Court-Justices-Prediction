justice
stewart
it
is
the
entry
into
the
home
that
presents
the
issue
in
this
case?
justice
stewart
not
what
happened
outside
the
house.
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
mr.
young,
i
notice
in
your
brief...
actually...
that
there's
only
one
question
for
review?
justice
stewart
did
we
give
a
limited
grant
of
certiorari?
or
was
that
the
only
question
you
were--
justice
stewart
--on
that
we
did
not
grant
certiorari?
justice
stewart
on
this
single
question?
justice
stewart
thank
you.
justice
stewart
is
it
any
part
of
your
argument,
mr.
frey,
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
and
in
some
cases,
impossible,
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment's
requirement
that
the
premises
to
be
searched
have
to
be
particularly
described?
justice
stewart
because
if
it's
just
a
transitory
presence
in
a
third
party's
house,
there's
no
reason
that
the
officers
would
know...
be
able
to
particularly
describe
the
premises
to
be
searched.
justice
stewart
particularly
describe
the
premises
to
be
searched.
justice
stewart
--home
of
a
totally
innocent
person?
