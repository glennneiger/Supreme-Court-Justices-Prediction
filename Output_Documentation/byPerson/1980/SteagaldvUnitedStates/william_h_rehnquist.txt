they
did
have
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
was
outstanding
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
your
position
that
in
addition
to
this
arrest
warrant
for
ricky
lyons,
and
a
reasonable
belief
that
ricky
lyons
was
on
the
premises,
they
needed
a
search
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right,
just
what
would
one
have
told
one
of
the
magistrates
on
duty
in
atlanta,
in
order
to
obtain
the
search
warrant
for...
going
on
the
premises
of
your
client
to
arrest
ricky
lyons?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
concede
that
would
have
been
enough,
had
the
search
warrant
been
based
on
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
there
really
isn't
a
great
deal
that
a
law
enforcement
officer,
who
has
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant
and
believes
that
the
subject
of
the
warrant
is
on
someone
else's
premises,
can
tell
a
magistrate
if
he's
seeking
a
search
warrant
of
the
premises
in
addition
to
the
kind
of
information
that
you're
talking
about,
is
there?
he
may
not
know
anything
about
the
premises
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
young,
ordinarily
this
court
does
not
canvass
volumes
of
records
to
determine
motivation
where
two
courts
have
found
something
sufficient.
you
are
not
challenging
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
never
admit
we
do--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--actually,
we
cited
cravero
in
dalia
v.
united
states,
did
we
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
so
far
this
sounds
like
something
out
of
st.
thomas
aquinas;
perhaps
it's
our
fault
rather
than
yours
that
it
does,
but
we
granted
certiorari
on
a
particular
question,
and
i
would
have
expected
to
hear
argument
on
that
question,
first.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
one
of
the
nine
members
of
the
court,
so
i
certainly
can't
say
the
court
prefers
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
you
don't
generally
look
for
a
person
in
a
desk
drawer?
