mr.
john
richard
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
richard
young,
i'm
from
atlanta,
georgia,
and
i've
been
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
on
january
the
18th,
1978,
under
the
direction
of
the
federal
drug
enforcement
administration,
approximately
12
police
officers
armed
with
a
variety
of
shotguns,
side
arms
and
automatic
weapons,
spread-eagled
the
petitioner
against
his
automobile
in
full
view
of
a
public
road
and
in
front
of
his
home.
they
detained
him
there,
and
then
proceeded
to
conduct
a
room
to
room
search
of
his
house.
mr.
john
richard
young
your
honor,
we...
when
we're
looking
at
the
degree
of
the
intrusion,
that
is...
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
i
think
it's
important,
when
we're
talking
about
the
privacy
of
the
american
citizen,
and
evaluating
the
extent
of
a
search,
to
recognize
that
this
was
an
extraordinary
invasion
of
his
privacy.
mr.
john
richard
young
your
honor,
i
refer
to
it
as
his
house
rather
than
calling
it
the
premises
in
which
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
the
standing
issue
i
will
address;
however,
we
believe
that
the
record
supports
the
finding,
if
the
government
is
entitled
to
raise
that
issue
at
this
late
date,
that
indeed
he
did
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
home.
i
refer
to
it
as
his
home
for
shorthand.
the
government
took
these
actions
without
a
search
warrant--
mr.
john
richard
young
--yes.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir,
i'm
just
giving
the
factual
background
which
includes
that.
mr.
john
richard
young
there
was
no
search
warrant
and
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
excusing
the
absence
of
the
search
warrant.
inside
the
house,
the
police
found
45
pounds
of
cocaine,
which
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
on
the
grounds
that
the
warrantless
search
violated
his
fourth
amendment
right
to
privacy.
mr.
john
richard
young
possession
and
for
conspiracy.
mr.
john
richard
young
of
that
cocaine.
mr.
john
richard
young
they
did
it,
basically,
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
a
series
of
pre-search
contacts
which
the
petitioner
had
with
the
import
company
which
had
imported
the
brass
lamps
from
colombia
in
which
the
cocaine
was
secreted.
that
issue
is
really
not
before
the
court,
but
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence--
mr.
john
richard
young
--yes
sir,
that's
their
position
now;
it
wasn't
their
position--
mr.
john
richard
young
--they
did
it
with
circumstantial
evidence,
your
honor,
by...
and
it
would
take
quite
some
time
to
elicit
all
the
facts,
but
he--
mr.
john
richard
young
--all
right,
sir.
thank
you.
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
basis
that
the
agents
who
conducted
this
search
had
an
arrest
warrant
for
an
individual
by
the
name
of
ricky
lyons,
who
they
had
reason
to
believe
was
located
in
petitioner's
home.
this
ruling
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
the
united
states
v.
cravero,
which
it
held
that
an
arrest
warrant,
even
without
exigent
circumstances
was
a
specific
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
search
warrant
requirement,
if
the
officers
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
subject
of
the
warrant
could
be
found
inside
the
premises.
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
two
other
specific
facts
before
i
move
directly
to
the
issue.
the
phone
call
which
was
made
by
a
drug
enforcement
administration
agent,
which
assembled
these
12
officers,
was
made
at
approximately
1
or
2
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
january
the
18th,
prior
to
the
5
o'clock
search.
the
phone
call
was
made
from
the
united
states
district
courthouse
in
atlanta,
georgia,
where
there
were
three
full
time
magistrates
on
duty.
the
agent
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
there
was
no,
that
there
was
nothing
that
prevented
him
from
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
secondly,
when
this
platoon
of
agents
arrived
at
this
house...
there
were
two
houses
situated
more
or
less
next
door...
both
houses
were
approached,
only
one
house
was
ultimately
searched...
when
asked
why
they
went
down
to
the
second
house,
the
agent
at
the
suppression
hearing
stated,
"the
purpose
of
going
to
the
a-frame.
"
--that's
what
the
other
house
was
referred
to
in
the
record...
"was
the
same
as
going
to
the
house
at
the
top
of
the
hill.
"
"we
didn't
know
which
house
the
individuals
might
have
been
at.
"
mr.
john
richard
young
allegedly...
well,
no
one
was
the
object
of
their
pursuit.
allegedly,
ricky
lyons
was
the
object
of
their
interest,
although,
as
i
will
explain,
we
believe
there
is
substantial
doubt
on
the
record
that
in
fact
they
were
going
there
after
ricky
lyons,
or
if
there
were
going
after--
mr.
john
richard
young
--yes
sir.
well
they
didn't
have
it,
but
under
federal
law,
it's
not
necessary
that
they
have
it.
there
was
one
existing,
but
they
didn't
have
it
in
their
possession.
mr.
john
richard
young
yes
sir,
there
did
exist
an
arrest
warrant
for
ricky
lyons.
it
had
been
issued
in
july
of
1977,
as
a
consequence
of
a
july
'77
indictment
which
alleged
acts
that
had
occurred
in
1973.
it
was
a
marijuana
case.
mr.
john
richard
young
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances?
mr.
john
richard
young
precisely
my
position.
mr.
john
richard
young
he
would
have
told
the
magistrate,
first
under
oath,
that
he
had
obtained
information
from
a
reliable
confidential
informer,
upon
whom
he
had
relied
successfully
in
the
past,
and
that
the
information
was
credible,
and
that
the
information
consisted
of
this:
the
informant
provided
the
dea
agent
with
a
phone
number
where
he...
where
the
informant
said,
ricky
lyons
and
his
partner,
jimmy,
his
partner
in
the
drug
business,
jimmy,
could
be
found
within
a
pertinent
period
of
time.
he
told
the
agent
that
he
knew
that
because
he
heard,
he
talked
to
him
on
the
phone,
he
was
given
that
phone
number
as
to
where
jimmy
was,
and
he
overheard
ricky's
voice
in
the
background.
the
agents
then,
of
course,
traced
the
address
through
the
phone
company,
and
that's
all
the
agent
would
have
had
to
have
told
the
magistrate,
in
order
for
that
magistrate
to
make
the
determination
that
petitioner's
right
of
privacy
would
have
to
yield
to
the
dea's
need
to
search
for
ricky
lyons.
however,
the
magistrate
never
had
that
opportunity;
the
police
made
this
judgment
on
their
own.
mr.
john
richard
young
had
the
search
warrant
been...
well,
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
it
is
assumed
there
was
probable
cause
or
at
least
reasonable
belief
to
belief
that
lyons
was
there.
mr.
john
richard
young
that's
true.
however,
it's
our
position
that
the
issue
is
not
so
much
how
much
he
would
have
to
tell
the
magistrate,
but
rather,
the
need
of
the
magistrate
to
stand
between
him
and
the
privacy
rights
of
the
petitioner
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances.
that's
our
position.
and
we
contend,
as
your
honor
has
noted,
that
there
must
be
a
search
warrant
in
this
case,
and
we...
or,
in
these
circumstances.
and
we
begin
with
a
notion
that
the
fourth
amendment
contains
two
basic
principles.
and
one
is,
which
apparently
this
case
met
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal,
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
object
or
the
person
which
the
police
are
seeking
is
contained
in
the
place
they
want
to
search.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir.
and
in
fact,
nobody,
none
of
these
agents
had
even
ever
seen--
mr.
john
richard
young
--they
were,
precisely;
yes
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir,
no.
not
under
federal
law.
mr.
john
richard
young
certainly,
your
honor.
under
warden
v.
hayden,
that's
hot
pursuit
and
this
court
permits
that.
mr.
john
richard
young
yes
sir,
under
warden
v.
hayden,
they
could.
mr.
john
richard
young
yes
sir.
that
is
an
exigent
circumstance--
mr.
john
richard
young
--from
his
point
of
view,
your
honor,
it
is
that
he
has
the
right
and
the
need,
and
this
country
has
the
right
and
the
need,
for
an
individual's
expectation
of
privacy
not
to
yield
on
the
basis
of
the
judgment
of
the
police,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
judgment
of
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
the
reason
that
a
magistrate
is
interposed
was
most
succinctly
said
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
mcdonald
v.
united
states,
when
he
said
"power
is
a
heady
thing,
and
the
police
acting
on
their
own
cannot
be
trusted.
"
that
is
what
is
important,
is
that
magistrate,
in
the
absence
of
an
exigent
circumstance
such
as
hot
pursuit,
as
you
indicated,
must
stand
between
the
police
and
the
citizen.
mr.
john
richard
young
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
determination
of
probable
cause,
and
the
need
to
invade
the
citizen's
privacy,
petitioner's
privacy,
must
be
made
prior
to
the
search.
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
it
was
made
only
by
the
police.
this--
mr.
john
richard
young
--no
sir,
when
agent
goodowens
called
to
assemble
this
raiding
party,
he
should
have
taken
five
minutes
and
gone
next
door
and
talked
to
the
magistrate
and
gotten
a
search
warrant.
mr.
john
richard
young
certainly.
mr.
john
richard
young
yes
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
that's
a
fallback
position
could
have
carried
out.
mr.
john
richard
young
correct.
mr.
john
richard
young
the
search
warrant
necessary
to
give
them
the
right
to
enter
petitioner's
home
in
order
to
execute
that
arrest
warrant.
mr.
john
richard
young
all
right,
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir,
it
was
leased
by
the
smiths,
or
by
mr.
smith,
who
was
the
individual
who
was
arrested
as
he
came
into
the
house
and
arrived
in
a
truck.
mr.
john
richard
young
all
right.
well,
let
me
go
ahead
and
address
the
standing
issue
at
this
time,
and
insofar
as
it
is
properly
before
this
court.
we
believe
that
the
standing
issue
is
not
before
this
court
and
would
urge
the
court
not
to
take
the
government's
invitation
to
remand
this
case
in
order
to
determine
if
petitioner
has
a
standing
under
the
more
recent
case
of
united
states
v.
salvucci.
and
our
reason
for
this
is
that
rakas
v.
illinois
was
decided
in
december
of
1978,
which
clearly
delineated
the
notion
that
standing
is
a
function
of
an
expectation
of
privacy.
briefs
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
by
the
appellant
and
the
government
were
not
filed
until
1979,
so
not
only
did
the
government
have
ample
opportunity
to
ask
the
fifth
circuit
to
remand
or
to...
remand
for
standing
or
to
decide
the
petitioner
didn't
have
standing.
but
moreover,
they
could
have
raised
it,
of
course,
at
the
trial
level.
salvucci
raised
his
standing
argument
from
the
very
beginning,
and
of
course
salvucci
eventually
overruled
the
automatic
standing
requirement
of
jones.
the
government
says
that
because
we
were
all
proceeding
under
jones,
that
this
court
should
reevaluate
the
case
in
light
of
salvucci,
we
say
the
government
made
a
tactical
decision.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
they
had
rakas
to
stand
on,
and
they
could
have
asked
that
the
case
be
remanded;
they
didn't.
we
infer
from
the
record
that
they
didn't,
because
they
knew
that
they
had
cravero
in
their
hip
pocket.
mr.
john
richard
young
that
may
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
john
richard
young
that...
it
could
be.
mr.
john
richard
young
well
i'm
not
sure
i
know.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
richard
young
--i'm
not...
i
would
be
speculating,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
tell.
mr.
john
richard
young
your
honor,
i
really
haven't
given
that...
i
haven't
evaluated
that
aspect
of
it.
our
position
on
standing
is
that
it
was
simply,
it
was
waived
by
the
government
below
and
it
was
waived
on
the
basis
of
a
tactical
decision.
mr.
john
richard
young
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
can't
answer
that.
however,
we
also
contend
that
from
the
record,
there
are...
there
is
enough
evidence
to
reasonably
infer
an
expectation
of
privacy
under
salvucci,
even
under
the
stricter
standard
of
salvucci,
and
we
point
to
the
fact
that
the
confidential
informant
stated
that
there
were
four
or
five
people
staying
there.
we
infer
that
that
is
gaultney
and
his
wife,
who,
the
record
indicates,
were
staying
in
the
front
bedroom;
smith
and
his
wife,
who,
the
record
doesn't
indicate
where
they
were
staying,
but
it
indicates
that
he
had
leased
the
place,
and
steagald.
second,
steagald
was
out
front
of
the
house
in
his
shirt
sleeves
on
a
wintry
january
afternoon,
his
sweater
which
he
knew
exactly
where
it
was,
was
found
in
the
house.
third,
he
had
papers
of
his
in
the
house,
and
fourth,--
mr.
john
richard
young
--yes
sir,
two
checks
and
an
invoice.
mr.
john
richard
young
two
checks
and
an
invoice.
and
fourth,
the
automobile
out
front,
we
believe,
might
be
reasonably
inferred
to
be
his
automobile
inasmuch
as
the
trial
transcript--
mr.
john
richard
young
--he
was...
there
was
apparently
something
wrong
with
the
engine,
your
honor;
they
were
looking
at
the
engine.
mr.
john
richard
young
inasmuch
as
the
record
indicates
that
steagald
had
an
old,
beat-up
volkswagen.
now
any
one
of
these
factors
taken
by
itself
is
not
going
to
give
petitioner
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
of
his
home,
i
don't
contend
that.
but
these
facts
taken
together,
we
believe,
give
rise
to
that
inference.
mr.
john
richard
young
the
way
that
they...
i
contended
at
trial
that
his
connection
with
the
house
was
too
tenuous
to
even
get
to
the
jury,
to
withstand
the
judgment
of
acquittal
motion.
the
government
argued,
in
response
to
that
and
to
the
jury,
once
it
got
to
the
jury,
that
the
fact
that
his
sweater
was
there,
the
fact
that
these
papers
were
there,
the
fact
that
his
car
was
out
front,
these
facts
that
i
have
just
elicited,
to
rely
on
alleging
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
the
government
relied
upon...
to
place
him
connected
to
that
house--
mr.
john
richard
young
--other
than
that...
sir?
mr.
john
richard
young
and
connected
to
the
drugs,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
that
was
part
of
the
evidence,
your
honor.
there
was
a...
the
court
has
to
understand
that,
prior
to
this
search,
the...
there
was
evidence
which
the
government
introduced
that
involved
a
number
of
contacts
that
steagald
had,
where
the
import
company
that
it
was
proved
had
moved
the
drugs
from
the
airport
to
a
warehouse,
he
rented
the
warehouse,
he
set
up
an
answering
service
for
the
import
company,
all
these
type
of
circumstantial
contacts
with
the
merchandise
in
which
this
cocaine
was
concealed.
so
the
government
relied
upon
that,
and
then
the
government
relied
upon
the
various
evidentiary
inferences
to
which
it
was
entitled
from
those
four
or
five
facts
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
concerning
his
connection
with
the
house
in
which
the
cocaine
was
ultimately
found.
so
we
say
that...
that
the
court
should
find--
mr.
john
richard
young
--oh
yes
sir.
the--
mr.
john
richard
young
--whether--
mr.
john
richard
young
--your
honor,
i
simply
have
to
apologize.
i
have
not
given
that
any
thought.
mr.
john
richard
young
i
believe
so,
yes,
yes
sir.
now
government
also--
mr.
john
richard
young
--one
bedroom,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
well
i
say
he
had
privacy
in
the
whole
house
because
he--
mr.
john
richard
young
--because
he
was
living
there,
your
honor.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir,
i
think
that
would
be
more...
the
equivalent
to
a
hotel.
mr.
john
richard
young
it
was
found
in
the
front...
well,
it
was
found
in
several
places,
but
it
was
first
found--
mr.
john
richard
young
--in
the
front
bedroom.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
well
again,
the
record
doesn't
clearly
indicate
which
room
was
his.
mr.
john
richard
young
so
we
don't
know
which--
mr.
john
richard
young
--we
say
on
the
basis
of
those...
those
facts
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
entire
premises.
mr.
john
richard
young
yes
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
no
sir,
you
find
that
the
government
has
waived
it,
at
least
that's
what
i
urge
the
court
to
do.
now
another
issue
that
the
government
raises...
before
i
get
to
the
next
issue
the
government
has
raised,
let
me
say
that
our
position
on
the
arrest
warrant
is
this;
that
the
arrest
warrant
affords
no
protection,
indeed
in
its
issuance
it
doesn't
even
take
into
consideration
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
the
third
party...
consequently
the
arrest
warrant
is
simply
not
sufficient
and
it
makes
on
difference
whether
the
search
is
for
a
person
or
a
thing,
since
the
intrusion
is
the
same.
so
we
say
that
the
government
had
to
have
a
search
warrant.
now
the
government
also
raises,
again
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
the
argument
that
because
cravero...
united
states
v.
cravero...
was
the
law
in
the
fifth
circuit
at
the
time
of
this
search...
that
this
court
should
as
i
understand
their
argument,
adopt
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
and
hold
that
the
agents
in
this
case
were
acting
in
good
faith,
in
reliance
upon
cravero.
we
say
in
response
to
that,
first,
there
is
substantial
doubt
from
this
record
that
the
governments
were
in
fact
acting
in
good
faith.
we
believe
that
the
government
agents
believed
that
they
were
going
to
find
1500
pounds
of
marijuana
in
this
house
and
that
was
their
first
interest.
and
we
point
to
these
facts
in
the
record:
the
confidential
informant
had
said
that
there
had
been
a
drug
deal
in
florida
recently
consummated
by
ricky
lyons
and
this
individual
named
jimmy,
that
jimmy
had
attempted
to
sell
cocaine,
a
matter
of
days
or
a
week
prior
to
the
conversation
that
he
had
in
early
january
with
the
drug
enforcement
agent--
mr.
john
richard
young
--no
sir,
jimmy
is
ricky
lyons'
partner.
mr.
john
richard
young
all
right.
when
the
confidential
informant
first
told
the
drug
enforcement
agent
about
the
attempt
by
jimmy
to
sell
him
cocaine,
the
agent's
first
response
was
not
to
find
ricky
lyons,
was
not
to
get
that
information,
but
was
to
try
to
prevail
upon
the
confidential
informant
to
set
up
a
drug
deal
with
jimmy
and
have
this
one
go
through.
second,
that
same
agent
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
his
impression
from
the
confidential
informant
that
the
house
where
ricky
lyons
was,
was
a
"stash
house
for
narcotics".
he
answered,
i
asked
him
that,
if
he
knew
there
was
going
to
be
any
dope
there,
he
says
they
always
had
dope
around.
i
said
do
you
know
if
there's
going
to
be
any
there,
he
said
well
i
don't
know,
but
they
deal
in
it,
they
might
have.
and
that's
in
volume
ii
of
the
suppression
hearing
at
page
47.
moreover,
agent
goodowens
testified...
who
was
one
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
agents...
testified
that
the
confidential
informant
believed
that
there
would
be
drugs
there,
but
that
he
didn't
have
it
on
what
the
agent
called
hard
information,
in
other
words,
the
government
agent
did
not
have
sufficiently
hard
information
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
drugs,
but
they
believed
that
drugs
would
be
there.
finally,
a
gwinnett
county
police
officer,
which
is
the
county
in
georgia
where
this
house
was
located,
testified
that
one
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
agents
had
told
him
when
the
agent
first
called
him
to
organize
this
raid,
that
he
had
information
there
might
be
a
quantity
of
marijuana
in
this
house
and
he
testified
that
to
the
best
of
his
recollection
the
agent
told
him
1500
pounds.
finally,
after
the
quick,
first
search
of
this
house,
when
the
agent
came
back
outside
to
report
what
he
had
found
to
the
other
agents,
he
did
not
say,
as
they
were
looking
for
this
armed
and
dangerous
ricky
lyons,
no
luck,
ricky
lyons
isn't
here.
he
said,
i
think
i
found
some
cocaine.
we
believe
your
honors,
that
there
is
substantial
doubt
in
the
record
that
they
were
acting
in
good
faith;
indeed,
we
believe
there
is
a
great
likelihood
that
the
agents
in
this
case
did
exactly
what
cravero
gives
them
an
incentive
to
do,
and
that
is,
they
used
an
arrest
warrant
to
circumvent
the
search
warrant
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
richard
young
no,
your
honor.
no
sir.
secondly,
on
the
good
faith
argument,
in
order
to
apply
a
good
faith
exception
here
in
this
case
the
court
would
have
to
avoid
reaching
the
actual
issue
it
has
taken
certiorari
on.
article
iii,
of
course,
would
prevent
this
court
from
finding
that
a
search
warrant
is
necessary
in
these
circumstances,
but
it's
not...
and
will
be
necessary
from
now
on,
but
it's
not
necessary
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
because
the
government
was
acting
in
good
faith.
that
would
stand
as
mere
dictum.
therefore,
an
order
to
avoid
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
petitioner's
case
by
adopting
some
sort
of
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
court
would
have
to
avoid
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
we
urge
the
court
not
to
do
that,
the
question
has
evaded
review
for
quite
some
time;
it
was
characterized
as
a
grave
constitutional
issue
as
long
ago
as
1958
in
jones
v.
united
states,
and
the
cravero
rule
or
its
equivalent,
is
used
by
a
number
of
the
circuits...
it
is
not
used
by
others,
the
states
are
split
on
the
use
of
it,
as
are
the
commentators.
but
we
believe
the
court
should
address
that
issue.
mr.
john
richard
young
there's
only
one
issue
before
this
court
that
was
taken
on
certiorari,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
richard
young
no,
two
questions
were
presented.
the
second
question
was
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
ricky
lyons
could
be
found
in
this
house--
mr.
john
richard
young
--no
sir.
cert
was
denied
on
that
and
granted
on
this
question.
mr.
john
richard
young
on
that
single
issue,
yes.
mr.
john
richard
young
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
the
cravero
says
that
reasonable
belief
embodies
the
same
standard
of
reasonableness
as
probable
cause,
but
simply
gives
the
police...
or
permits
the
police
to
avoid
a
second
trip
to
the
magistrate,
in
other
words,
having
been
there
once
to
get
the
arrest
warrant.
mr.
john
richard
young
well,
but
your
honor,
we
say
that
probable
cause
is...
goes
hand
in
hand
with
one
of
two
things:
a
magistrate,
or
exigent
circumstances.
and
in
this
case,
or
in
cravero,
since
the
court
permits
a
finding
of
probable
cause
without
exigent
circumstances
and
without
a
magistrate,
that
is
why
they
have
called
it
something
of
a
lesser
standard,
namely
reasonable
belief.
it
is
also
the
authority
upon
which
cravero
relies,
is
really
a
strain
of
authority
from
the
previously
discredited
rabinowitz
decision
that
also
dealt
in
terms
of
a
reasonable
belief
standard.
and
we
believe
that
reasonable
belief
is
something
less
than
probable
cause.
mr.
john
richard
young
yes
sir.
i
would.
mr.
john
richard
young
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
having
read
several
of
the
cases
upon
which
the
government
relies,
we
say
that
there
are
two
significant
errors
in
the
government's
analysis
of
those
cases.
and
the
first
is,
that
for
example
in...
i
think
it's
semayne's
case,
lord
coke
is
addressing
a
situation
where
the
house
which
is
entered
is
the
defendant's
house
himself,
not
a
third
party's
house.
moreover,
in
the
semayne's
case,
lord
coke
is
somewhat
elaborating
upon
the
rationale
for
his
decision
in
that
case,
which
was
a
civil
case
incidentally.
and
he
gives
an
example
in
which
the
type
of
arrest
that
occurred
in
this
case
would
be
permitted,
and
it
was
a
hot
pursuit
example.
it's
a
straight
warden
v.
hayden,
decided
in
1967.
finally
of
course,
because
of
the
reverence
of
common
law
for
the
sanctity
of
the
privacy
of
an
individual's
home
as
opposed
to
the
right
of
privacy
in
other
situations,
we
believe
that
the
common
law
did
not
permit
this
type
of
search
and
if...
but
in
any
event,
or
at
the
very
least,
it
is
unclear
whether
the
common
law
did
or
not.
additionally,
the
arrest
rules
of
common
law
arose
in
the
context
of
usually
civil
damage
suits
or
either
false
arrest
or
trespassing.
and
consequently,
they
are
not...
even
if
they
are
as
the
government
says
they
are...
they
are
not
directly
applicable
to
the
situation
we
are
dealing
with.
and
the
officer's
authority
to
enter
was
generally
established
in
cases
where
he
was
being
sued
and
that
was
his
defense,
that
he
had
the
authority
to
enter.
and
finally,
of
course,
as
this
court
noted
just
last
term,
in
payton
v.
new
york,
this
court
does
not
simply
freeze
into
constitutional
law,
law
enforcement
practices
that
existed
at
the
time
the
fourth
amendment
was
enacted.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
thank
you.
mr.
john
richard
young
oh,
i
have?
