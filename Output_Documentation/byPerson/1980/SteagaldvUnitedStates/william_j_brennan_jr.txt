justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
they
connect
him
with
the
45
pounds
of
cocaine?
the
prosecution
was
what,
for
possession,
or--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--of
that
cocaine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
did
they
tie
him
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
curious,
since
the
government's
position
apparently
is
that
he
had
no
privacy
in
this
home,
whatever,
and
therefore
no
standing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
the
government
tie
him
then
to
the
stuff
they
found
in
the
house?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
bother.
i'll
ask
mr.
frey.
justice
jr.
now
mr.
young,
did
you
say
they
did
not
in
fact
have
the
arrest
warrant
on
them?
justice
jr.
no,
but
they
were
acting
on
the
authority
of
the
arrest
warrant,
weren't
they,
when
they
made
the
entry?
justice
jr.
--well,
mr.
young,
i
take
it,
whether
or
not
the
government's
omission
to
raise
this
below
precludes
their
being
heard
on
it
here,
is
at
least
in
part,
isn't
it,
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
this
standing
question
is
jurisdictional?
justice
jr.
if
it's
in
fact
jurisdictional,
and
thus
i
expect
they
may
raise
it
here
and
say
you
can't
do
it
because
you
have
no
jurisdiction
here,
could
that
be
it?
justice
jr.
well
now,
what
is
it?
what's
the
distinction
between
prudential
and
jurisdictional;
as
i
noted,
salvucci,
you'll
recall,
refers
to
it
as
fourth
amendment
standing...
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
jr.
perhaps
no
one
does--
justice
jr.
--do
you
think
this
is
jurisdictional?
justice
jr.
well,
except
that
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
they
didn't
raise
it
and
they
maybe
deliberately
didn't
raise
it.
but
if
it
is
jurisdictional,
doesn't
that
mean
we
can't
hear
them
here,
even
though
they
deliberately
did
not
raise
it
below?
justice
jr.
are
those
the
checks,
or
something?
justice
jr.
two
checks.
justice
jr.
was
he
washing
it
or
cleaning
it?
justice
jr.
oh.
justice
jr.
and
connected
to
the--
justice
jr.
--and
connected
to
the
drugs?
justice
jr.
is
that
the
way
they
connected
him,
with
evidence
like
that?
justice
jr.
so
at
least
to
that
extent,
i
gather
here
was
a
case
or
controversy
between
the
government
and
him
in
connection
with
the
drugs
themselves,
wasn't
there?
justice
jr.
that
they
were
his?
justice
jr.
does
that
bear
on
whether
this
is
jurisdictional
or
not?
justice
jr.
well
i
know,
but
standing
in
a
case
or
controversy
sense
is
what
makes
it
jurisdictional,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
is
jimmy
the
petitioner?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
well
why
do
you
think
we
have
to
hear
you?
justice
jr.
why
do
you
think
we
have
to
hear
you
on
the
issue,
since
you
never
raised
it
before?
justice
jr.
well
why
should
we,
when
you
didn't
raise
it
below?
justice
jr.
--but
don't
ordinarily,
we
qualify
that,
provided
he's
raised
it
below?
justice
jr.
--well
what
about
the
checks
and
the
sweater
and
those
other
things?
justice
jr.
is
he
right,
that
you
used,
or
that
the
government
used
those
at
the
trial
to
connect
him
with
the
cocaine?
justice
jr.
well
why
isn't
it...
if
it's
available
to
the
government
to
connect
him
with
the
cocaine
in
the
cabin,
why
isn't
it
also
available
to
establish
that
he
had
a
privacy
at
this
cabin?
justice
jr.
well
i
know
but
the
sweater
and
the
checks
and
those
things,
they
weren't
contraband.
justice
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
used
them
at
trial
to
establish
that
the
cocaine
was
his?
justice
jr.
i
know,
as
part
of
it,
but
that
was
the
evidence
you
relied
on?
justice
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
you
take
the
position
that
these
are
not
relevant
to
the
determination
of
whether
he
had
a
privacy
interest.
if
you
could
use
them
to
tie
him
to
the
cocaine,
why
can't
he
use
them
to
establish--
justice
jr.
--well,
are
you
also
saying
that
we
might
regard
them
as
sufficient
to
establish
that
he
had
a
privacy
interest?
justice
jr.
but
we
might...
but
we
could.
justice
jr.
we
could.
justice
jr.
but
mr.
frey,
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances
which
is
the
case
here,
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
get
a
search
warrant,
wasn't
there?
justice
jr.
when
they
left,
before
they
left
the
courthouse
they
could
have
gotten
it,
could
they
not?
justice
jr.
there
were
three
magistrates,
as
i
understand
it,
on
duty
at
the
time?
justice
jr.
well
i'm
accepting
your
colleague's
suggestion
that
the
assembly
of
the
12
officers
who--
