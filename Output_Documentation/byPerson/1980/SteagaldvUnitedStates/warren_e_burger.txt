we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
steagald
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
young,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
if
there
had
been
only
two
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
at
that
time,
what
was...
who
was
the
object
of
their
interest
in
their
pursuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
make
any
different
whether
they
had
it
in
their
pockets,
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
sense
spending
time
on
that.
now,
you've
referred
to
the
exigent
circumstances,
mr.
young.
suppose,
instead
of
having
all
these
advance
preparations,
they
had
been
literally
pursuing
lyons,
and
followed
him
on
foot
and
they
saw
him
dart
into
this
house,
could
they
have
followed
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
they
got
in
the
house,
if
they
saw
marijuana
or
other
contraband
in
plain
view,
could
they
seize
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
would
be
admissible?
chief
justice
burger
from
his
point
of
view,
the
occupant
of
the
house,
whatever
his
right
to
be
there
may
be
from
his
point
of
view,
why
is
it
different
whether
the
police
got
in
there
by...
the
agents
got
in
there
in
hot
pursuit,
or
got
in
there
in
cold,
deliberate
steps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
from
his
point
of
view,
i
take
it,
you
concede
that
he'd
be
in
a
very
different
position
from
the
hot
pursuit
situation,
he
would
have
no
basis
for
having
the
evidence,
the
plain
view
evidence
rejected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
by
hypothesis,
what
do
you,
if
i
may
press
this
one
on
you,
what
should
they
have
done:
surrounded
the
house,
since
they
had
adequate
manpower,
and
sent
one
of
the
agents
down
to
get
the
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
have
been
adequate
if...
he,
having
failed
to
do
that
and
arriving
at
the
house,
could
they
have
secured
the
premises
in
the
sense
of
surrounding
it,
and
then
got
the
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say,
that
was
the
fallback
position
they
should
have
carried
out--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--not
having--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--assuming,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
they
had
enough
to
present
to
the
magistrate
to
persuade
him
to
issue
the
warrant,
the
search
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
search
warrant
necessary
to
execute
the
arrest
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you've
used
all
of
your
time,
mr.
young.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well
what
about
getting
the
search
warrant
after
they
had
the
house
pretty
well
under
surveillance
and
control?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinions
of
the
court
in
steagald
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
