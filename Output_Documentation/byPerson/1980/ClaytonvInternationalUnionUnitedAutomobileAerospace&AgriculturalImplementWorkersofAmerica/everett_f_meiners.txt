mr.
everett
f.
meiners
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
initially
direct
my
comments
to
the
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
situation
which
the
lower
court
decision
has
left
the
employer
in.
the
employer
must
defend
the
union's
good
faith
as
a
result
of
that
decision
in
refusing
to
go
to
arbitration.
the
employer,
of
course,
was
not
a
party
to
that
decision,
wherein
the
union
made
the
determination
that
there
was
no
cause
in
their
mind,
no
justification,
to
take
that
grievance
that
mr.
clayton
had
filed
and
that
they
had
initially
requested
arbitration.
they
concluded
that
there
was
no
reason
to
take
that
matter
to
arbitration,
that
they
could
not
prevail
on
that
case.
but
the
employer
was
not
a
party
to
that
process.
in
the
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
procedure
the
union
is
the
party
that
investigates
that
procedure
and
makes
that
determination.
the
company
did
not
take
any
action
and
was
not
involved
in
any
manner
in
a
determination
or
an
attempt
to
convince
the
union
not
to
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
your
honor,
they
did,
the
union
steward
did
write
a
letter
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
advising
them
that
they
had
investigated
the
case.
on
page
78
of
the
appendix
there's
a
copy
of
that
letter
indicating
that
they
found
no
just
cause,
or
that
there
was
just
cause
for
the
termination,
and
indicating
also
that
mr.
clayton
was
a
union
steward
and
was
held
to
a
high
standard
of
care
with
respect
to
activities
of
that
type.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
having
there
withdrawn
the
request
for
arbitration,
that's
correct.
the
problem
that
you
have
is
that
the
unions
may
get
to
the...
or
the
employee
may
reach
the
underlying
grievance
without
having
to
be
held
to
the
strong
burden
of
establishing
a
breach
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation
that
he
may
have
to
establish
with
the
union
as
party.
if
the
union
is
not
a
party,
the
employee
merely
has
to
prove
to
them
a
prima
facie
case.
and
assuming
that
the
prima
facie
case--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--yes,
i
certainly
admit
that.
however--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--that's
correct.
however,
there
may
be
no
one
to
defend
against
that
claim.
the
union
may
no
longer
have,
certainly
has
no
monetary
incentive
in
order
to
participate
in
that
proceeding.
the
union
members
who
made
that
decision
are
not
under
the
control
or
direction
of
the
company.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
i'm
not
sure
that
the
underlying
contract
issue
should
be
reached
in
that
lawsuit
where--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--well,
it's
certainly
relevant
to
the
issue
of
proving
no
damages,
but
if
the
employee
only
proves
that
there's
been
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
certainly
under
vaca
there
would
be
this
allocation
problem.
but
his
next
step
then
would
be
to
establish
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
contract.
my
personal
feeling
is
that
neither
the
company
nor
the
union
should
be
in
a
situation
where
either
is
required
to
defend
the
actions
of
the
other
in
the
discharge
situation.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
that's
correct.
however,
that
destroys
the
efficacy
of
the
arbitration
grievance
procedure
which
normally
is
a
complete
block
to
the
issue
of
the
underlying,
reaching
the
issue
of
the
underlying
grievance
unless
there's
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
by
reason
of
the
lower
court's
decision
in
this
case.
it
is
true
the
prima
facie
case,
is
still
there
but
there
may
not
be
a
defense
or
if
there
is
a
defense
which
the
employer
has
to
present,
he
has
to
either
subpoena
or
try
and
obtain
the
cooperation
of
the
union
in
being
able
to
present
some
kind
of
a
defense
to
that
case.
he
is
not
the
party
that
has
the
information
to
present
a
case
that
shows
the
reason
why
the
union
did
not
breach
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
i
think
this
illustrates
from
the
company's
viewpoint
the
severe
problem
that
we
see
in
this
type
of
situation.
it
is
not
a
case
that
may
occur
every
time
by
any
means,
but
the
union
may
for
political
reasons
take
a
viewpoint
that
is
going
to
remain
neutral;
it's
not
going
to
encourage
or
assist
the
employer
in
presenting
a
defense
to
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
understand,
i
don't
follow
the
full
question.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
it
arises
only
when
there
is
a
claim
by
the
employee
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
and
in
that
situation
if
the
union
wants
to
support...
the
union
usually
would
take
a
position,
in
our
view,
fairly...
if
the
union
is
acting
fairly
and
honestly,
they
would
take
a
position
that
they're
trying
to
defend
and
show
why
the
action
that
they
took
was
taken
in
good
faith.
the
employer
had
no
part
in
that
proceeding
and
should
not
be
responsible,
in
our
view,
for
attempting
to
defend
a
traditional
party
that
the
employer
opposes.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
that's
correct.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
that
may
be
true,
yes.
we
would
hope
so,
if
we
were
ever
called
upon
to
present
that
case.
but
the
problem
here
is
one
of
whether
or
not
the
union's
decision
not
to
proceed
to
arbitration
is
one
which
the
employee
at
will
can
avoid?
and
whether
or
not
the
exclusivity
that
the
union
has
is
going
to
be
affirmed,
and
what
burden
is
going
to
be
placed
on
the
union
for
their
actions
as
opposed
to
the
company
for
their
actions.
we're
certainly
more
than
willing
and
we're
willing
initially
to
defend
this
matter
in
arbitration.
but
now
we're
six
years
down
the
road.
the
back
pay
that
mr.
mcternan
referred
to
as
early
reinstatement
is
a
situation
which
has
a
tremendous
impact
upon
the
employer
at
this
point.
arbitration
is
a
speedy
remedy
which
we
would
normally
go
through
and
have
this
matter
resolved
in
a
few
months'
time,
as
opposed
to
getting
involved--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--that's
correct.
under
vaca,
the
allocations
theory
should
place
that
burden
on
the
company.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
if
you
look
at
the
practical
viewpoint
of
presenting
the
defense
to
the
breach
of
the
duty,
i
think
that's
the...
we're
skipping
over
the
defense
which
has
to
be
presented
or
should
be
presented.
why
should
the
employee...
i
guess
maybe
we
can
get
back
to
this...
why
should
the
employee
be
able
to
go
to
arbitration
and
require
a
resolution
of
this
issue
if
the
union
in
good
faith
had
made
a
determination
that
this
is
not
an
issue
that
should
be
resolved
in
arbitration?
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
that's
correct.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
i
think
that
for
a
lot
of
the
reasons
that
we
have
indicated
that
this
presents...
puts
the
union
and
the
company
in
a
very
difficult
position
to
attempt
to
present
a
case
on
behalf
of
a
party
which
it
had
no
knowledge
of.
for
instance,
we
would
have
to,
if
this
case
were
to
go
back
down
to
trial
or
to
arbitration,
the
company
would
have
to
commence
some
type
of
a
discovery
process,
compulsory
discovery
process
possibly,
in
order
to
obtain
the
facts
which
could
be
used
to
present
a
defense
to
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
certainly,
we're
in
possession
of
and
would
be
able
to
present
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
underlying
grievance
itself.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
except,
the
union
may
well
not
be
in
a
position
that
they
feel
that
it
is
either
politically
or
appropriate
for
them
to
take
an
active
role
in
this.
and
it
may
be
one
where
it
is
difficult
for
the
employer
to
obtain
the
cooperation
of
the
union
in
presenting
their
claims.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
but
then,
in
our
view--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--no.
there's
not
going
to
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
in
the
union;
that's
correct.
but
the--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--yes,
there
could.
and
i
think
that
from
the
employer's
viewpoint,
this
gets
back
to
the
basic
problem
that
we
see
whereby
this
type
of
a
case
may
end
up
for
resolution
before
a
court
and/or
a
jury.
it
is
our
belief
that
the
better
method
to
resolve
this
controversy
would
be
to
have
a
remand
of
the
case
to
arbitration
and
for
the
arbitrator
to
review
the
issues
and
to
make
the
ultimate
decision
which
he
should
have
made,
should
have
been
called
upon
to
make.
but
we
look
at
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
nolde
brothers
case
as
possibly
a
basis
whereby
this
court
can
determine
that
there
is
a
theory
where,
that
the
exhaustion
of
internal
union
remedies
may
result
in
the
reinstatement
of
the
grievance
in
the
arbitration
procedure.
in
that
case,
of
course,
the--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--has
expired
during
the
process
of?
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
because
i
believe
that
the
nolde
brothers
decision
raises
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
or
not
because
of
the
national
labor
policy
that
is
deemed
to
be
incorporated
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
when
it
is
written,
that...
and
in
that
case
the
decision
indicated
that
unless
the
agreement
expressly
or
directly
negated
the
possibility
of
the
grievance
in
that
instance...
of
course
the
contract
had
expired...
i
think
that
the
same
situation
can
be
said
to
apply
here.
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
which
expressly
provides
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
that
the
grievance
cannot
be
reinstated
in
the
procedure.
that
subject
is
not
discussed,
and
based
on
the
strong
national
policy
which
favors
arbitration
as
a
method
of
resolution
of
these
disputes,
we
would
suggest
that
the
processing
of
mr.
clayton's
claims
through
the
internal
union
procedures
could
resolve--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--would
i
say
the
same
thing
in
a
joint
board
situation?
well,
i
think
that
a
joint
board
in
my
mind
does
raise
some
differences
because
it
is
not
the
normal,
independent
arbitrator
that--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--in
some
areas.
in
construction
areas
they
are--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--correct.
but
it's
not
in
our
area,
fortunately.
so
that,
we
can
see
a
situation
under
your
nolde
brothers
decision
and
looking
at
vaca
v.
sipes,
that
the
employee
does
have
a
right
that
if
there
is
a
determination
by
an
internal
union
remedy,
that
the
employee
does
have
the
right
to
reinstitute
the
grievance
and
to
proceed
back
into
arbitration.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
points
that
needs
to
be
examined
is
the
posture
of
the
employee
when
he
goes
back
to
the
arbitration
procedures.
i
think
that
the
employee
should
raise
if...
there
are
a
number
of
different
cases,
some
cases
where
the
union
is
clearly
discriminating
against
the
individual.
in
other
cases
they
have
merely
let
lapse
the
time
limit,
in
a
situation
where
they've
let
a
time
limit
lapse
negligently
or
whatever
the
standard
is
that
makes
that
act
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
yes,
that's
correct,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
i
think
that
one
of
the
possibilities
is
that
the
employee
may
obtain
his
own
counsel
in
an
appropriate
case.
i
think
that
this
is
a
matter
which
should
be
raised
before
the
internal
union
remedy,
before
the
prb
in
this
instance,
to
determine
that
maybe
there
is
an
internal
discrimination
against
him,
and
he
needs
additional
protection.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
in
the
arbitration?
normally,
in
an
arbitration
he
would
not
have
that
right.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
under
this
contract
the
employee
does
not
have
a
right,
normally,
to
have
a
separate
independent
counsel.
this
is
a
matter
that
when
the
grievance
is
presented
at
the
arbitration
the
union
of
course
is
the
exclusive
agent
and
the
only
party
that's
authorized
to
have
a
counsel
at
that
meeting.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
it
may
be...
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
i'm
sorry?
that
letter?
it
may,
and
it
may
be
a
reason,
a
justification,
in
this
type
of
situation
for
the
employee
to
have
separate
independent
counsel.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
that's
correct.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
i
don't
believe
that's
true
that
in
any
event
it
would
have
to
be
decided
by
a
court.
i
think
that
that
is
the
ultimate--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--yes,
that's
correct.
that's
a
separate
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
that's
correct.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
well,
that's
true,
but
the
court
is
not
required
to
reach
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract.
the
court
only
has
to
make
a
determination
that
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
there
may
have
been
a
breach
in
that
the
union's
action
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
was
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
standard.
the
court
is
not
required
to
reach
that
issue.
but
i'd
like
to--
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
--yes,
i
agree
with
that.
yes.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
yes.
the
union,
of
course,
has
a
broad
range
of
authority
here
and
is
only
held
to
a
very
stringent
standard,
and
it
is
generally
authorized,
of
course,
under
vaca
v.
sipes
to
be
the
exclusive
agent
and
to
represent
the
employees
in
all
of
their
cases,
and
to
make
determinations
if
sometimes
the
case
that
the
employee
is
wanting
to
pursue
through
arbitration
is
not
justified,
and
even
though
it
might
sacrifice
some
rights
of
his
for
the
entire
unit,
that
the
approach
taken
by
the
union
is
the
correct
approach.
so
that
the
union
does
have
a
broad
authority
in
that
type
of
determination.
mr.
everett
f.
meiners
thank
you.
