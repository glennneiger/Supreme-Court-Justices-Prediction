justice
stevens
mr.
mcternan,
may
i
ask
you
a
kind
of
a
preliminary
question?
if
you
assumed,
contrary
to
your
argument,
that
the
union
did
provide
a
completely
adequate
remedy,
that
they
had
some
totally
impartial
review
situation
and
would
give
an
answer
within
two
weeks,
say,
would
you
concede
or
would
you
not
that
in
that
situation
there's
a
duty
to
exhaust?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
a
provision
in
it
that
if
that
review
board
found
there
was
inadequate
representation
there's
a
duty
to
reopen
the
arbitration
proceeding,
and
so
on.
i
want
to
assume
for
a
moment
that
you
could
conceive
of
an
adequate
remedy.
i
want
to
know
whatever
or
not
you
would
still
argue...
which
i
don't
see
why
you
couldn't,
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
view
is...
would
you
still
say
there's
no
duty
to
exhaust?
or
does
this
depend
on
inadequacy?
and
if
there
is
a
duty
to
exhaust,
what's
the
source
of
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
meiners,
as
i've
tried
to
think
through
this
argument
that
the
employer
is
in
an
impossible
position
because
he
doesn't
know
the
facts,
but
isn't
it
correct
that
the
employee
has
the
burden,
rather
severe
burden,
of
showing
arbitrary
conduct
by
the
union
and
what
it
really
amounts
to
is,
you
have
two
defenses?
you
still
have
your
defense
that
you
didn't
reach
the
contract
in
the
first
place,
and
you
have
the
additional
defense
that
maybe
he
can't
prove
arbitrary
conduct.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
better
position
than
the
employers
are
in
a
lot
of
lawsuits.
well,
but
not
as
good
a
position
as
you're
in
right
now,
having
won
in
the
arbitration.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it's
still
a
tough
prima
facie
case.
justice
stevens
it's
the
same
legal
standard
as
if
the
union
was
a
party.
justice
stevens
the
argument
is
made
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
i
don't
remember
which,
that
suppose
you
have
a
situation
in
which
for
some
reason
the
employee
elects
just
to
sue
the
union
and
doesn't
sue
the
employer.
and
there
the
union,
in
order
to
establish
no
damages,
finds
itself
in
the
position
of
demonstrating
there
was
no
breach
of
contract.
so
is
it
any
further--
justice
stevens
--well,
as
a
matter
of
proving
no
damages
it's
certainly
relevant.
justice
stevens
well,
they
don't
have
to.
i
mean,
you
still
have
your
own
defense
that
you
had
no
breach
of
contract.
justice
stevens
except,
mr.
meiners,
the
real
reason,
as
i
understand
the
briefs,
is
the
reason
they
abandoned
the
claim
was
they
thought
there
was
no
merit
in
it.
justice
stevens
and
you're
able
to
prove
that,
if
the
facts
are
as
they're
described
in
some
of
the
briefs,
it's
a
fairly
simple
case.
justice
stevens
you
don't
really
have
an
exposure
for
back
pay
during
the
period
that
you
could
rely
on
the
arbitration
award,
do
you?
i
think
you
have
a
duty...
assuming
he
wins
ultimately,
you
might
have
to
reinstate,
but
you're
not
liable
to
back
pay
for
the
interim,
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me,
just
again
thinking
out
loud,
that
most
of
the
time,
i
would
assume,
when
the
union
abandons
a
claim,
it's
probably
because
it
doesn't
think
it
has
any
merit.
i
assume
it
does
that
thousands
of
times
around
the
country.
and
normally
the
company
is
perfectly
able
to
substantiate
the
reasons
there's
no
merit
to
claim.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
why
it's
such
a
burden.
this
doesn't
necessarily
reach
the
merit
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
but
here
in
the
discovery,
presumably,
is
you
take
a
deposition
of
the
steward
and
he
says,
i
investigated
the
claim
and
i
thought
the
company
was
right;
that's
why
i
abandoned
it.
justice
stevens
mr.
whitman,
will
you
help
me
out
on
one
rather
simple
point,
i
guess?
what's
the
source
of
the
duty
of
the
employee
to
make
an
attempt?
justice
stevens
well,
is
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
judge
should
reach...
now,
it's
a
kind
of
the
federal
judge
is
both
the
lawmaker
and
the
decider
under
your
view...
that
if
there's
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
get
the
union
to
review
the
decision,
that
ipso
facto
establishes
an
inability
to
prove
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
then
it
would
necessarily
follow,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
that
holding.
would
you
agree
with
that
at
all?
justice
stevens
mr.
whitman,
to
the
extent
that's
a
valid
argument,
and
it's
quite
persuasive,
it
should
be
available
to
the
employer
as
well.
justice
stevens
of
course,
here,
the
trial
judge
thought
they
should
both
do
likewise,
is
the
way
it
looks.
