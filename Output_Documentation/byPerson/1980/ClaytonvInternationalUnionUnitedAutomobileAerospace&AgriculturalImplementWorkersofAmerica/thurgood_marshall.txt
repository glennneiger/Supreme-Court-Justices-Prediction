i
don't
think
you're
right
there.
they
were
up
against
both,
the
railroad
and
the
brotherhood,
weren't
they?
and
wasn't
the
action,
the
complaint,
that
then
you
go
to
the
mediation
board?
and
the
fact
was
the
mediation
board
was
appointed
by
members
of
the
brotherhood
and
the
employer?
justice
marshall
i
might
have
missed
it,
but
the
union
didn't
give
any
reason
for
withdrawing,
it
just
withdrew;
isn't
that
right?
justice
marshall
how
could
you
do
that
in
this
case,
in
the
light
of
this
letter?
how
could
you
reverse
your
position
in
the
light
of
this
letter?
justice
marshall
on
behalf
of
you.
justice
marshall
but
that's
not
what
this
said.
this
man
says
he
hasn't
got
a
suit.
justice
marshall
that's
what
he
says.
you
could
reverse
that
in
the
light
of
this?
you
can't
eat
it.
it's
going
to
be
there.
justice
marshall
but
there
are
thousands
of
grievances.
justice
marshall
in
this
particular
company,
it
shows
on
this
one,
doesn't
it,
that
there
are
4,000
already...
what
is
it?
this
number
is
24,060,
the
number
of
this
grievance.
so
it
meant
that
before
then,
there
were
24,000
that
were
denied.
this
is
a
lot
for
one
company,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
it
is?
justice
marshall
this
case
has
been
over
four
years,
hasn't
it?
