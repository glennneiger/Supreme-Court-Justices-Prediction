justice
white
part
of
that,
i
suppose,
is
that
if
he
sues
the
employer
alone
and
that
case
went
to
judgment,
the
judgment
against
the
employer
should
not
include
any
damages
that
were
caused
by
the
union.
justice
white
well,
not
if
the
union
was
responsible
for
the
discharge.
justice
white
it's
not
a
different
point
if
the
union
had
maliciously
caused
the
discharge.
i
don't
know
that
the
employer's
going
to
be
liable
for
back
pay.
justice
white
and
what
if
the
union
tells
a
lie
to
the
employer
about
an
employee
and
the
employer
discharges
him?
justice
white
well,
in
those
cases
the
employer
knows
that
it's
acting
under
pressure
from
the
union.
suppose
it's
acting
in
perfectly
good
faith
and
the
union
just
tells
it
a
lie
about?
justice
white
no,
no,
but
the
he
certainly
wouldn't
be
paying
back
pay.
justice
white
all
right,
all
right.
justice
white
oh,
yes;
we're
talking
about
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
white
but
did
the
employee
ask
the
union
to
take
it
to
arbitration?
justice
white
well,
mr.
mcternan,
in
prior
cases,
i
recall,
when
it
was
suggested
that
if
the
union
breached
its
duty,
and
therefore
the
employee
shouldn't
be
bound
by
defective
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures,
i
recall
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
employee
were
that
he
shouldn't
be
sent
back
to
arbitration
either,
because
he
would
be
there
being
represented,
or
at
least
accompanied
by,
or
at
least
with
a
party
in
the
picture
that
had
shown
it
incapable
of
representing
him.
justice
white
no.
justice
white
well,
i
thought
that
the
employee
has
got
the
burden
of
proving
a
breach
of
duty,
and
you
don't
prove
a
breach
of
duty
just
by
saying
that
the
union
failed
to
take
it
to
arbitration.
justice
white
so,
it's
a
rather...
if
reasonable
men
could
have
differed
about
the
validity
of
the
claim,
the
union
is
going
to
win.
and
it's
not
just
a
low
threshold
question
that
the
employer
has
got
to
get
over.
justice
white
the
real
issue
in
these
breach
of
duty
cases,
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
in
an
awful
lot
of
them,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
real
substance
in
the
claim
that
the
employer
breached
the
contract.
justice
white
your
employer
is
the
one
that
knows
that.
and
if
you
can
substantiate,
even
make
a
reasonable
case,
that
you
fired
him
for
cause,
like
the
contract
required,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
breach
of
duty
in
the
union,
is
there?
justice
white
how
can
you
get
the
employer
back
to
the
arbitration
table
when
the
contract
time
has...
when
all
he
promised
to
do
he's
done?
justice
white
how
can
you
get
him
back?
justice
white
would
you
say
the
same
thing
in
a
joint
board
situation
where
there
was
no
arbitrator?
justice
white
they're
in
rather
widespread
use
though,
aren't
they?
justice
white
of
course,
you
agree
that
the
predicate
to
getting
back
to
the
arbitration
table
or
getting
to
the
contract
claim
at
all
is
contingent
on
proving
the
breach
of
duty
by
the
union?
justice
white
which,
in
the
first
instance,
if
you
don't
require
them
to...
or,
in
any
event,
is
going
to
have
to
be
decided
by
a
court.
justice
white
it's
true
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
held
in
miranda
fuel
or
some
case
that
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice,
too,
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
unions?
justice
white
if
there's
a
suit
filed
against
the
employer
and
the
union
claiming
the
union
breached
its
duty
and
therefore
the
employer
breached
the
contract,
the
courts...
before
there'll
be
a
recovery
against
the
employer
there's
got
to
be
proof
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
union.
justice
white
well,
then,
if
that's
going
to
have
to
be
tried
out,
an
awful
lot
of
the
facts
in
the
case
are
going
to
be
there.
justice
white
i
don't
understand
that,
i
just
don't
understand
that.
if
i
were
an
employer
i
would
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
proof
of
a
finding
by
the
court
that
the
union
breached
its
duty
before
the
employer
would
ever
have
to
face
the
contract
provisions.
justice
white
well,
then,
this
has
to
be
tried
out
in
a
court,
and
an
awful
lot
of
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
will
already
be
there
on
the
table.
justice
white
how?
he
has
to,
without
being
able
to
prove
the
breach
of
duty
by
the
union,
he
can't
proceed.
justice
white
you
think
this
holding,
this
exhaustion,
just
protects
the
union,
and
that
he
could
still
be
free
to
prove
your
breach
of
duty
in
his
suit
against
the
employer?
justice
white
all
right,
let's
assume
you
do,
and
the
union
turns
him
down,
and
decides
that
we
didn't
breach
a
duty
at
all
and
we're
not
going
to
go
back
to
arbitration.
that
is
all,
we
just--
justice
white
--i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
white
then
the
suit
goes
forward
against
both?
justice
white
mr.
mcternan,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
about
exhaustion,
is
one
of
your
questions
here
also
that
the
union
should
not
have
been
dismissed
from
the
suit?
justice
white
and
why
is
that?
justice
white
and
so
you're
just
entitled
to
sue
them,
that's
all.
justice
white
and
if
you're
going
to
have
to
prove
a
breach
of
representation,
you
want
the
union
there
as
a
party
so
you
have
the
advantages
of
working
against
the
defendant,
all
the
remedies
against
the
defendant?
justice
white
discovery
and
other
things?
justice
white
but
i
suppose
there
is
some
great
advantage
to
having
them
as
an
opponent
in
the
lawsuit
rather
than
as
a
third-party
witness?
justice
white
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
white
the
procedure
was
exhausted.
