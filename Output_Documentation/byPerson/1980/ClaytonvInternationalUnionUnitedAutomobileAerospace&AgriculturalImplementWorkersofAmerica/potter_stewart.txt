justice
stewart
well,
has
the
court
really
held
that
these
are
301
actions?
wasn't
the
genesis
of
the
vaca
v.
sipes
doctrine
the
cases
of
tunstall
and
steele,
years
ago,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
when
there
was
no
301?
that
is,
a
failure
to
represent
employees
fairly
and
squarely.
justice
stewart
well,
first
of
all,
he
has
to
show
and
prove
that
he
was
not
properly
represented
through
whatever
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
may
have
been
by
his
representative,
the
union
organization.
justice
stewart
and
only
then,
after
he's
proved
that,
may
he
sue
the
employer.
is
that
the?
justice
stewart
and
any
suit
against
the
employer
would
be
a
plain
vanilla
301
action.
justice
stewart
well,
except
that
the
tunstall
and
steele
cases
were
decided
in
the
total
absence
of
anything
like
301.
justice
stewart
and
they
were
actions
only
against
the
union,
were
they
not?
