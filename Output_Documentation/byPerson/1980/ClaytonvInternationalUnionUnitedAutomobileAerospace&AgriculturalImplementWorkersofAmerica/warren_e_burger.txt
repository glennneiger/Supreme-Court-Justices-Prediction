we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
clayton
v.
international
union
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
mcternan,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
yes;
the
first
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
meiners.
chief
justice
burger
is
the
employer
put
in
this
position
you
describe
every
time
the
union
declines
to
support
the
employee's
claim,
or
even
assuming
for
perfectly
valid
reasons,
as
you
do
here?
chief
justice
burger
does
this
problem
for
the
employer
arise
every
time
a
union
declines
to
carry
the
ball
for
the
employee?
chief
justice
burger
well,
i'm
assuming
that.
chief
justice
burger
would
you
agree
that
after
the
letter
that
was
written,
appendix
page
78,
that
he
hasn't
got
a
very
enthusiastic
advocate
in
the
arbitration
proceeding?
chief
justice
burger
he'd
have
to
go
out
and
get
his
own
counsel.
chief
justice
burger
anything
in
union
regulations
or
the
contract
that
limits
his
right
to
get
independent
counsel
in
the
arbitration?
chief
justice
burger
normally...
not
here.
under
his
contract?
chief
justice
burger
but
here
his
advocate
has
in
effect
entered
a
guilty
plea.
has
he
not?
chief
justice
burger
that
would
go
before
the
arbitration
board,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
meiners.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
whitman.
chief
justice
burger
doesn't
it
pervade
all
of
the
labor
law
of
the
last
40
years,
more
or
less,
that
there
should
be
exhaustion
of
all
these
intermediate
efforts
before
getting
into
the
judicial
process?
isn't
that
the
whole
concept
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcternan.
chief
justice
burger
had
he
gone
back
for
arbitration,
how
do
we
know
but
it
might
have
been
settled
a
long
time
ago?
chief
justice
burger
it
was
conceded,
unless
you
disagree
with
it...
that
makes
it
quite
different...
that
he
could
get
outside
counsel
and
go
to
arbitration.
chief
justice
burger
not
after?
before
he
started
his
lawsuit
in
the
district
court,
are
you
saying
he
could
not
have
had
arbitration
with
his
own
private
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
