justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
concede,
mr.
mcternan,
that
the
liability
of
the
employer
under
an
action
such
as
this
is
necessarily
conditioned
on
the
liability
of
the
union
also?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
do
concede,
do
you
not,
under
this
agreement
that
the
employee
couldn't
go
indirectly
into
court?
he
had
to
first
go
to
the
union
and
see
if
the
union
would
press
his
claim
to
arbitration?
justice
rehnquist
but
there's
also...
if
one
were
to
adopt
the
principle
that
the
employee
can
go
directly
into
court,
you're
going
to
inevitably
be
involved
in
a
lot
of
line-drawing
problems.
while
some
may
be
simple
as
justice
stevens
says,
that
the
union
simply
decided
there
was
no
merit
to
the
claim,
but
there
could
be
conceivably
some
very
complex
reasons
why
the
union
decided
not
to
process
the
claim.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
breach
of
duty
concept
is
a
fairly
flexible
one,
is
it
not?
that
the
union
is
considered
to
have
a
great
deal
of
discretion
as
to
what
claims
to
press
and
what
not,
and
what
trade-offs
to
make
in
the
administration
of
the
contract?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
steelworkers'
trilogy?
the
idea
of
keeping
this
whole
kind
of
dispute
out
of
the
federal
courts
as
much
as
possible?
justice
rehnquist
does
the
employee
have
the
same
choice
as
the
employer
to
choose
litigation
over
arbitration?
justice
rehnquist
then
he
doesn't
have
to
name
the
union
as
a
party?
justice
rehnquist
it
also
goes
back
behind
the
j.
i.
case
case,
in
effect,
doesn't
it,
where
the
court
said
that
under
collective
bargaining
you
can't
have
an
individual
employee
contracting
separately
with
the
company?
