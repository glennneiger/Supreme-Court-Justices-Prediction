mr.
m.
jay
whitman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
union's
approach
and
concerns
and
perspectives
here
are
quite
different
from
those
of
either
mr.
clayton
or
itt.
to
begin
with
let's
be
clear
about
what
this
court
does
and
does
not
have
to
decide
in
this
matter.
the
union,
particularly
the
uaw,
is
not
interested
in
getting
into
the
business
of
judging
federal
rights.
we
are
not
enfranchised
by
article
iii.
the
court
needn't
in
the
situation
presented
here
reconsider
or
revisit
vaca
or
maddox
or
hines
or
any
of
these
issues.
this
is
a
case
where
mr.
clayton
made
no
attempt
at
all,
where
he
was
told
he
was
a
steward,
the
remedies
were
facially
adequate.
there
are
really
only
three
logically
possible
sorts
of
case
that
can
arise.
one
is
this
case,
the
no-attempt
case,
where
no
attempt
was
made.
the
second
is
the
case
alluded,
sort
of
case,
category
of
case
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
where
an
attempt
is
made
but
the
contractual
provisions
are
fashioned
in
a
way
so
that
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
are
perpetually
open
to
the
possibility
that
the
union
through
internal
review
might
reverse
itself
and
order
its
agents
to
reinstitute
the
matter
into
the
grievance
procedure
and
hence
to
arbitration.
that's
the
case,
for
example,
in
the
general
motors,
ford,
chrysler--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--mr.
justice
marshall,
the
answer
is
that
that
letter
was
written
by
an
international
representative--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--who
is
one
of
our
line
troops
and
is
subject
as
the
agent
of
a
corporation
is
subject
to
the
board
of
directors.
our
position
is
simply
that
mr.
clayton
should
have
asked
the
store
manager
before
he
brought
suit.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
that's
right.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
that
takes
us
to
the
third
set
of
cases,
your
honor.
if
that
problem
arose
in
the
general
motors
system,
it
would
go
back
into
the
arbitration
procedure.
or
if
it
arose
in
general
electric,
where
there
are
no
time
limits,
it
could
be
refiled
without
any
trouble.
or
it
could
arise
in
a
contract
where
an
individual
can
decide
to
go
to
arbitration
or
not,
that
the
union
has
no
exclusive
right
to
make
that
decision.
you
are
quite
right;
that
is
not
this
case.
this
is
a
no-attempt
case.
the
third
sort
of
case
is
a
case
where
the
attempt
is
made
but
if
the
contract
procedures
in
the
regular
course
of
their
operations
were
allowed
to
function,
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
would
close.
those
are
the
sorts
of
cases
where
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
matter
is
arbitrable.
now,
i
can
address,
if
i
will,
all
those
cases,
but
i
would
like
to
stress
that
the
issues
that
have
been
discussed
earlier,
many
of
the
issues
are
issues
which
arise
only
on
that
third
set
of
cases,
which
is
not
this
case.
this
is
a
case
where
no
attempt
was
made
of
any
sort.
and
so
the
court
really
needn't
get
into
those
areas,
particularly
on
this
sort
of
a
record.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
the
source
of
the
duty,
your
honor,
is
the
discretion
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
article
iii.
it's
an
inherent
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
stay
its
hand
until
the
controversy
is
ripe,
consistent
with
federal
policy
and
consistent
with
republic
steel
v.
maddox,
to
see
that
individuals
are
told
that
they
ought
to
ask
the
store
manager,
they
ought
to
give
the
union
a
fair
opportunity
to
take
a
crack
at
this.
now,
if
the
fair
opportunity
comes
to
ground,
if
it's
futile,
i
mean,
if
he's
told,
as
was
the
case
in
glover,
that
this
is
not
for
blacks,
that's
a
different
matter.
but
the
federal
courts
ought
to
have
the
discretion
and
ought
to
apply
it
as
a
routine
matter
consistent
with
maddox
to
hold
their
hand,
at
least
for
that
period.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
i
would
agree
that
if
the
man
is
told
to
go
file
his
appeal
and
he
does,
and
it
comes
to
an
end,
then
he
ought
to
be
able
to
resume
his
litigation.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
well,
then,
that's
a
strike
on
him.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
well,
what
happens
to
the
suit
against
the
employer?
well,
typically,
if...
i
presume
he'd
then
proceed
against
the
employer.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
no,
the
question
is
whether
he
is
not
able
to
prevail
against
the
union
because
he
didn't
attempt
the
internal
procedures
and
didn't
give
that
opportunity
to
the
union.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
i
don't
see
any
logical
impediment
to
that
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
the
better
result
would
be
for
the
trial
bench
not
to
rush
into
putting
the
employer
in
the
sort
of
dilemma
of
nonfinality
which
was
presented
in
the
hines
v.
anchor
motor
freight.
but
it
may
come
to
the
point
that
the
employer
simply
will
not...
that
the
union
reverses
itself
and
the
employer
refuses
to
reentertain
the
grievance,
or
insist
on
the
contractual
remedies.
the
employer,
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me,
has
chosen
litigation
over
arbitration.
now,
the
employer
may
not
do
that.
the
contractual
provision,
like
the
general
motors
or
general
electric
provisions,
might
require
him
to
put
it
back
in,
in
which
case
the
problem
will
go
away.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
your
honor,
all
that's
required
to
decide
this
case
is
to
decide
that
federal
district
courts
have
the
discretion
as
a
routine
matter
to
require
the
attempt.
there
was
no
attempt
here.
whether
or
not,
if
an
attempt
were
made,
and
what
follows
from
that
is--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--a
letter
to
douglas/fraser.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
that's
all.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
he
processes
it...
well,
it
is
typically
presented
to
the
international
executive
board
which
sits
in
panels
of
three,
and
they
go
out
to,
the
location
and
they
have
a
hearing
and
they
make
the
report--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--the
step
above
that,
by
analogy
to
the
appeal
to
the
stockholders
in
a
corporate
case,
is
to
one
of
two
places,
at
the
option
of
the
appellant.
one
is
to
the
convention
appeals
committee,
which
originated
as
a
standing
committee
of
the
convention.
it's
a
body
of
delegates,
elected
delegates,
rank
and
file,
selected
by
lot,
that
meets
every
six
months
and
decides
that.
or
alternatively,
the
man
can
go
to
the
public
review
board
and
tell
his
problems
to
dean
st.
antoinne
and
robin
fleming
and
gentlemen
of
that
sort.
the
choice
is
the
appellant's.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
no,
it's
the
final
level.
he
has
a
choice
of
which
one.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
it
depends
on
the
case.
as
i
mentioned
in
the
brief,
if
you
have
a
30-day
time
limit
and
he
files
on
day
two
rather
than
on
day
thirty
it's
faster.
but
we
have
competing
values
here.
in
the
uaw
system,
for
example,
we've
been
very
careful
to
insert
due
process
and
protections
at
each
stage.
of
course,
as
the
court
well
knows,
any
time
you
insert
due
process
there
is
the
prospect
of
litigants
generating
delay.
if
you
insist
on
a
complete
record
being
sent
from
the
local
union,
one
has
to
write
a
letter
to
the
local
union
and
get
the
record
and
be
sure
it's
complete,
and
so
on.
the
same
thing
is
true
if
counsel
is
allowed,
as
is
the
case
here--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--yes,
your
honor.
no
question
about
that.
so,
it's
not
as...
timing
of
these
matters
is
not
as
simple
as
it
would
appear.
there
are
these
competing
values
and
values
which,
i
suggest...
which
would
ruin
a
case
when
attempts
have
been
made,
and
it
was
a
question
of
the
timing.
it's
best
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
bench;
i
mean,
the
trial
bench
is
quite
able
to
recognize
the
situation
when
the
man
is
being--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--an
employer
could
be...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
he
does
prove
that,
then
he
has
a
right
under
the
contract.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
this
court
held
in
vaca,
as
i
read
it,
that
he
doesn't.
in
vaca,
in
fact,
there
was
a
separate
piece
of
litigation
pending
at
the
trial
court
level.
vaca
was
only
brought
against
the
union.
this
can,
it
can
occur
in
the
reverse
situation,
or
it
can
occur,
and
it
most
commonly
does,
these
days,
in
the
ford
v.
huftman
context
where
both
are
sued.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
well,
your
honor,
yes,
he
often
is.
in
fact,
it's
ironic
that
his
percentage
of
success
is
greater
before
the
convention
appeals
committee
and
the
delegates
than
it
is
before
the
public
review
board.
they
more
frequently
reverse
the
international
executive
board.
if
i
had
to
say
as
a
rule
of
thumb,
of
the
dozen
cases
that
come
up
every
six
months,
the
national
department
or
part
of
the
union
is
probably
knocked
down
in
at
least
one,
perhaps
two
of
those
cases,
in
recent
times.
while
this,
of
course,
isn't
in
the
record,
some
years
ago
i
did
a
count
of
the
public
review
board
decisions
that
reversed,
and
it
struck
me
that
the
percentage
was
roughly
equivalent
to
the
percentage
of
trial
court
decisions
that
are
reversed
by
this
court,
if
you
compare
it
to
the
percentage
of
cases
on
which
there
is
a
petition
for
certiorari.
the
difference
is
that
the
public
review
board
can't
deny
cert.
it
has
to
take
them
all.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
your
honor,
there
are
very
many
thousands
of
grievances.
in
the
general
motors
system
alone,
if
my
memory
serves,
there
are
something
like
a
quarter
of
a
million
grievances
filed
every
year.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
i
don't
know,
but
it's
conceivable,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
there
is
a
lot
of
controversy,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
meritorious
and,
i
must
say,
frivolous
grievances
in
the
industrial
system.
but
that
brings
us
back
to
the
need
for
a
delicacy
in
this
area.
i
mean,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
created
by
this
court
to
preserve
the
delicate
balance
between
individual
rights
and
the
collective
interest,
and
to
maintain
that.
and
that's
what
vaca
and
steele
and
all
those
cases
hold,
and
that
this
is
not
an
area,
for
that
very
reason,
for
sweeping
and
per
se
rules,
for
taking
discretion
from
the
district
bench
and
saying
that
never
in
any
situation
must
there
ever
even
an
attempt
be
made.
the
only
thing
the
court
needs
to
decide
here
is
whether
in
the
attempt
case,
the
union
should
be
given
a
fair
opportunity?
now,
practically
speaking,
a
couple
of
things
are
going
to
happen.
given
a
man,
or
woman,
the
grievant,
is
going
to
be
flatly
wrong
about
his
claim
under
the
contract
and
the
union
is
going
to
be
able
to
convince
him
he's
wrong
and
he'll
forget
about
it
and
go
away,
well,
he
won't
forget
about
it;
he'll
litigate,
frivolous
though
it
may
be.
and
if
that
happens,
it
happens.
there's
no...
i
mean,
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
say
that
this
procedure
is
going
to
warranty
the
federal
judiciary
against
having
to
see
frivolous
grievances--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--yes,
and
for
that
reason,
i
think,
in
the
appropriate
case
the
district
court
would
be
well
advised
to
say
to
the
employer,
wouldn't
it
be
nice
if
at
least
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
you
are
willing
to
accept
this
back
into
the
grievance
and
arbitration
case,
should
the
union
reverse
itself,
or
hold
its
hand
to
see
what
happens.
bur
it's
a
frequent
practice
in
the
trial
bench
now
that
what
the
court
does
is,
it
enters
a
stay
of
the
proceedings
and
tells
the
fellow
to
go
off
and
take
an
appeal,
and
then
sees
what
happens.
the
problem
is
that
mr.
mcternan's
position
would
remove
even
that
authority.
it's
a
broad
position.
what
it
really
is,
is
going
back
to
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
republic
steel
v.
maddox,
which
as
you
know--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--true.
it
goes
back
that
far.
but
the
proposition
is
a
simple
one
that's
being
urged
by
mr.
clayton,
that
a
fellow
ought
to
be
able
to
get
a
lawyer
and
sue,
now,
without
attempting,
without
pausing,
without
asking
the
higher-ups
in
the
union,
without
seeing
if
they
remedy
his
complaint.
even
if
the
grievant
is
not
wronged
by
this
claim,
there
may
be
a
greater
wrong,
a
wrong
to
the
collective
interest.
and
the
union
and
the
individual
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
address
that
and
see
if
the
man
can't
be
convinced
that
the
union
and
the
rest
of
his
workers
will
be
worse
off.
it's
like
cross-examination.
you're
very
often
in
a
position
where
you
don't
ask
a
question
because
you
may
be
worse
off
asking
it
and
having
the
answer
than
never
having
asked
it
at
all.
and
that's
often
the
case
with
grievance
and
arbitration
cases.
i
mean,
if
we
arbitrate
a
weak
case,
the
employer
may
find
himself
armed
with
an
invulnerable
precedent
for
the
unceremonious
discharge
of
arguably
similar
cases.
and
that's
where
this
balance
of
collective
and
individual
interest
is
important,
and
it's
a
scant
price
to
suggest
that
a
man
must
at
least
attempt.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
yes,
your
honor,
and
it's
the
concept
for
very
practical
reasons.
we
are
dealing
with
an
integrated
complex
industrial
system
that
has
wide
varieties
in
contract
language
and
approaches
of
employers,
and
internal
union
procedures,
and
this
matter
oughtn't
to
be
decided
by
a
get-a-lawyer-and-sue
approach.
the
unions
of
the
country
ought
to
be
told
that
they
ought
to
undertake
procedures
to
get
their
house
in
order,
and
the
employers
ought
to
be
told
that
they
should
adopt
and
consider
situations
like
the
general
motors
and
general
electric
approach
that
puts
it
back
into
the--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--if
he
refuses
to--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
and
the
problem
may
go
away.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
the
prudent
course
would
be
to
hold
the
procedures
against
the
employer
and
in
that
effort
to
see
what
happened,
because
it's
really
premature--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--then
both
the
union
and
the
employer
will
proceed
with
the
suit.
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
if
the
man
goes
to
the
union
and
the
union
says,
you're
wrong,
and
you
won't
believe
you're
wrong--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--as
i
say,
i
can't
warranty
against
frivolous
litigation
or
litigation
where
the
union
isn't
willing
to
cure
a
fault
in--
mr.
m.
jay
whitman
--well,
your
honor,
i
suppose
the
answer
is
that
it
will
depend
on
the
factual
setting
and
the
employer's
attitude
