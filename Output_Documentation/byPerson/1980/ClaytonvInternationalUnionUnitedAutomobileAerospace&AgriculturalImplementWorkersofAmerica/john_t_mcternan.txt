mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
section
301
action
instituted
by
petitioner
clayton,
my
client,
claiming
that
his
employer,
petitioner
itt,
discharged
him
without
just
cause
in
violation
of
the
collective
agreement
and
that
his
bargaining
agent,
the
uaw,
violated
its
duty
to
represent
him
fairly
by
withdrawing
his
discharge
grievance
from
the
arbitration
process.
clayton's
action
seeks
what
has
been
called
by
this
court
in
vaca
v.
sipes
judicial
enforcement
of
his
contractual
rights,
and
to
us
that
means
either
a
hearing...
it
means
a
hearing
before
a
tribunal
which
can
either
reactivate
his
grievance
or
determine
his
right
to
reinstatement.
in
the
court
below
both
the
itt
and
uaw
asserted
as
affirmative
defenses
clayton's
failure
to
resort
to
his
internal
union
procedures.
by
virtue
of
an
order
of
trifurcation
that
issue
was
tried
first
and
the
district
court
held
that
the
union
procedures
were
adequate
to
afford
him
the
remedy
he
sought
and
dismiss
the
action
against
both
defendants.
on
appeal
the
dismissal
of
the
claim
against
the
union
was
affirmed
and
the
dismissal
of
the
claim
against
the
employer
was
reversed
and
remanded
for
trial.
it
is
true
and
uncontestable
that
clayton
did
not
resort
in
any
way
to
his
internal
union
procedures.
he
was
justified
in
that,
we
contend,
because
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
an
utterly
idle
act.
the
uaw
procedures,
we
submit,
were
inadequate
as
a
matter
of
law;
they
were
inadequate
in
the
facts
of
this
case
because
they
could
not
effect
a
reactivation
of
his
grievance
or
his
reinstatement;
and
they
were
inadequate
because
they
were
incapable
of
rendering
a
decision
within
the
four-month
period
allowed
in
section
411(a)(4)
in
the
first
proviso.
first,
as
to
our
position
that
the
union
procedure
was
inadequate
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
rely
first
upon
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
nlrb
v.
marine
shipbuilding
workers
to
the
effect
that
where
the
employee's
complaint
raises
matters
in
the
public
domain
and
go
beyond
internal
union
procedures,
the
union
procedures
cannot
be
used
to
delay
his
resort
to
the
court,
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
for
vindication
of
his
rights
under
section
8(b)(1)(a)
of
the
amended
national
labor
relations
act.
here,
too,
clayton
asserts
rights
in
the
public
domain,
his
right
to
fair
representation,
the
union's
duty
fairly
to
represent
him,
a
duty
as
developed
by
judicial
interpretation
and
application
of
section
9(a)
of
the
amended
national
labor
relations
act.
and
we
think
that
the
rights
involved
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
the
rights
involved
in
nlrb
against
the
marine
shipbuilders.
the
principle
that
i
have
just
tried
to
enunciate
or
elaborate
was
applied
by
the
9th
circuit
in
bise
v.
the
i.b.e.w.
with
a
similar
result.
but
perhaps
more
fundamental
than
this
and
going
to
the
competence
of
the
union
tribunal
is
the
fact
that
we
deal
here
with
rights
governed
by
federal
law.
this
court
has
enunciated
in
a
number
of
cases...
vaca
v.
sipes,
and
motorcoach
employees
v.
lockridge,
the
automobile
case,
the
name
of
it
escapes
me
for
a
moment...
humphrey
v.
moore...
that
there's
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
claim
of
the
breach
of
that
duty
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
section
301
action,
and
it
is
controlled
by
federal
law,
and
the
last
formulation
of
that
in
the
lockridge
case
was
to
the
effect
that
whether
the
proof
established
the
requisites
of
the
breach
of
duty
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
vaca
v.
sipes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
went
far
beyond
the
steele
and
humphrey
v.
moore,
and
held
that
where
that
breach
exists,
that
is
the
condition
precedent
to
the
employee's
right
of
action
under
301
in
the
court
for
breach
of
the
collective
agreement.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
right.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
right.
and
in
that--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--well,
but
the
language
in
vaca
v.
sipes...
there
are
two
sections,
and
one
i
recall
precisely
is
that
the
court
said
in
that
opinion
that
the
claim
of
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
section
301
action.
and
i
think
that
there
are
other
opinions
from
this
court
as
well
as
many
in
the
courts
of
appeals
which
say
that
the
breach
of
the
duty
claimed
is
part
of
the
section
301
action.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
seem
to
be
necessary
to
conclude
that
if
proving
that
breach
is
a
condition
precedent
to
going
on
to
the
claim
of--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--quite
so;
quite
so.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
right.
as
i
recall,
that's
true.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
unable
to
recall
whether
the
employers
were
involved
in
those
actions
or
not.
oh,
excuse
me,
they
were
in
humphrey
v.
moore,
but
in
steele
i'm
not
sure.
but
the
rest
of
what
you
said
i
accept
as
true,
yes.
that's
the
way
i
recall
it.
but
what
i
want
to
emphasize
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
claim
of
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
coupled
with
the
claim
of
breach
of
the
collective
agreement.
and
the
employee
is
allowed
to
sue
the
employer
in
court,
thus
not
being
involved
in
the
arbitration
proceeding,
only
by
virtue
as
proof
that
the
union
has
breached
its
duty
to
him.
so
i
say
that
if
we
deal
here
with
matters
of
federal
law
under
section
301
both
with
reference
to
the
claim
of
the
breach
of
duty
and
the
claim
of
breach
of
the
collective
agreement,
we
deal
with
matters
which
are
entrusted
to
the
courts
under
section
301,
the
statute
explicitly
to
this
effect,
and
only
the
courts
can
interpret
and
apply
that
law;
the
uaw
tribunals
are
not
competent
to
do
so.
and
for
the
courts
to
delegate,
if
you
will,
that
responsibility
to
the
courts
would
be
a
violation
of
the
principles
of
lincoln
mills,
and
therefore
i
say
that
for
all
of
these
reasons
that
this
uaw
procedure
was
inadequate
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
it's
conditioned
upon
proof
that
the
union
breached
its
duties,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
employees
may
sue
the
employer
alone
and
prove
in
that
action
the
union's
breach
of
duty,
and
therefore
establish
his
right
to
go
ahead
on
the
merits
of
his
breach
of
the
collective
agreement
claim.
now,
when
we
get
to
damages
we
have
another
problem
and
as
the
court
said
in
vaca
v.
sipes,
the
union's
liability
to
the
employee
in
these
cases
is
only
for
the
increases,
if
any,
and
the
pecuniary
damage
done
to
the
employee
by
reason
of
the
union's
conduct,
but
the
union
cannot
be
held
liable
on
damages
for
the
damages
caused
by
the
employer's
conduct.
and
so
the
doctrine
of
comparative
fault,
if
you
will,
is
established
in
vaca
so
as
to
involve
an
appointment
of
the
damages
as
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
have
i
answered
your
question,
sir?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
would
think
so,
yes.
well,
you
see,
if
he
got
a
judgment
against
the
employer,
that
might
very
well
be
an
order
of
reinstatement
with
back
pay
at
least
up
to
the
point
where
the
union's
conduct
took
over.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
well,
now,
you've
raised
a
different
point.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
justice
white,
this
court
has
been
very
careful
to
distinguish
those
cases
in
which
the
conduct
of
the
employer
and
the
conduct
of
the
union
were
independent
and
discrete,
and
where
each
would
be
then
liable
for
his
proportionate
share
of
the
damage
caused.
but
where
they
act
together,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
in
czosek
v.
o'mara,
there
you
have
a
different
problem,
and
there
can
be
joint
liability
because
they
acted
jointly.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
this
court
has
affirmed
in
a
number
of
cases
nlrb
orders
where
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
employer
acted
under
pressure
from
the
union,
but
yet
the
employer
is
responsible
for
its
conduct.
now,
the
apportionment
of
it
is
a
different
matter
and
i'm
not
arguing
that
now.
but
i
say
that
the
employer
can
be
liable
and
has--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--then
i
think
the
apportionment
rule
would
apply,
but
i
don't
think
the
employer
would
be
relieved
if
his
duty
to
reinstate
the
man.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
if
all
of
the
back
pay
losses
stemmed
from
the
union's
conduct,
then
i
would
say--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--yes?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
sir,
i
don't
think
that
it's
consistent
with
lincoln
mills
for
the
judiciary
to
delegate
to
union
tribunals
the
interpretation
and
application
of
federal
law
under
section
301;
number
one.
and
number
two,
i
think
that
however
detached
and
dignified
the
union
tribunal
is
and
however
fast
it
could
act,
it
simply
is
unable
functionally
to
effect
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
restoration
of
this
employee's
contractual
rights,
namely,
his
right
to
have
his
job
back.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
think
that
there
is
no
unqualified
duty
to
exhaust.
i
think
that
exhaustion
which
involves
the
union
tribunal
and
the
interpretation
and
application
of
federal
law
would
be
a
miscarriage
of
the
doctrine
under
lincoln
mills.
however,
i
can
see
the
situation
in
which,
if
the
union
tribunal
had
the
power
to
reactivate
the
grievant
by
finding
that
the
union
breached
its
duty,
there
might
be
some
room
there
for
requiring
exhaustion,
assuming
that
the
time
limitations
could
be
satisfied.
in
that
we
have
a
problem
here.
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
arbitration
or
further
processing
of
grievances
which
the
union
decided
it
had
withdrawn
in
breach
of
its
duty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
intended
to
say
later,
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
of
an
intent
quite
to
the
contrary.
there
was
a
stipulation
at
the
trial
that
one,
the
grievance
was
withdrawn
from
arbitration.
it
was
the
end
of
the
road
so
far
as
the
contract
remedies
were
concerned,
and
my
colleagues
here
advised
the
trial
court
that
itt
conceded
that
it
had
no
obligation
whatever
to
reconsider
the
grievance
even
if
the
union
found
that
there
had
been
a
breach
of
its
duty.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
i
don't
concede
that
in
this
case.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
procedure?
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
the
grievance
procedure
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract
provides
for
a
three-step--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--oh,
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
arbitration
was
requested
and
then
withdrawn
by
the
union.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
oh,
no
question
about
that.
he
had
to
invoke
his
contract
remedies.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
that's
very
clear
in
all
of
the
cases,
yes.
and
we
don't
claim
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
side-step
those
at
all.
of
course
he's
required
to
do
that.
it's
when
he's
deprived
of
those
remedies
by
union
conduct
that
breaches--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--yes,
there
is
that
problem,
and
that
problem
exists,
it
seems
to
me,
in
any
reactivation
case.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
meet
that
problem
here.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
but
let
me
say
that
in
your
opinion
in
vaca
v.
sipes,
you
considered
the
question
of
whether
the
court
should
decide
the
collective
bargaining
contract
issue
or
whether
it
should
be
remanded
for
arbitration,
and
the
court
held
there,
in
your
language,
that
this
was
a
remedy
for
the
trial
court
to
consider
in
light
of
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
sound
approach
to
it,
because
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
make
an
inflexible
rule.
i
had
hoped
to
save
some
of
my
time.
may
i
desist
now
and
resume
later?
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
may
i
conserve--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--thank
you.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
i
understand
it,
the
duty
to
exhaust
is
a
requirement
which
derives
from
the
first
proviso
of
411(a)(4).
but
whether
the
requirement
will
be
imposed
is
a
matter
of
judicial
discretion.
in
the
trial
court
that
requirement
was
imposed
on
the
ground
that
the
union
remedy
could
afford
this
man
money
as
a
complete
answer
to
his
entire
problem.
and
we
take
the
position,
i
think
it's
correct,
and
it
follows
the
policy
laid
down
in
chambers
and
other
cases
which
we
cite,
that
he
may
not
be
required
to
resort
to
a
remedy
that
cannot
give
him
the
relief
he
seeks.
and
to
require
him
to
take
money
in
place
of
what
i
concede
to
be
a
unique
job
is
certainly
to
deny
him
the
relief
he
seeks.
this
man
had
8-1/2
years'
seniority;
he
was
a
black
worker,
in
a
market
area
where
the
black
rate
of
unemployment
is
twice
that
of
whites,
and
he's
thrown
out
and
lost
his
8-1/2
years
and
he
can
never
regain
it.
he
has
to
have,
it
seems
to
me,
a
right
to
get
at
reinstatement.
now,
so
far,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
the
tradition
of
exhausting
all
of
these
things
before
resort
to
court
is
concerned,
i
submit
to
you
that
exhaustion
cannot
be
imposed
arbitrarily
and
as
an
empty
procedure.
what
can
he
get
out
of
going
to
the
store
manager,
as
mr.
whitman
put
it?
he
can
get
from
the
store
manager
at
best
an
admission
that
the
store
manager
was
wrong.
and
what
does
that
get
him?
it
gets
him
possibly
damages
from
the
union
sometime,
after
the
liability
of
the
employer
is
decided,
but
he
still
has
to
go
to
court
to
get
his
reinstatement
rights
determined.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
yes,
sir,
that's
our
point;
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
our
position
is
that
the
union
procedures
were
inadequate
as
a
matter
of
law--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--correct.
and
this
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
jump
to
a
lawyer
and
sue,
it's
a
question
of
going
to
a
tribunal
where
you
have
a
chance
of
getting
what
you're
seeking.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
exactly.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
exactly.
and
if
we
were
to
proceed
against
the
employer
alone,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
to
do,
and
we
should
win
in
the
trial
court,
then
we'd
have
to
go
back
and
sue
the
union
again
for
its
share
of
the
damages.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
indeed
it
is,
because
then
we
have
the
right
to
discovery
under
the
civil
rules.
i
would
like
to
close
with
just
one
observation
about
the
ease
of
these
union
remedies.
it
isn't
simply
a
matter
of
writing
a
letter
to
douglas
fraser.
it's
a
matter
of
first
going
to
the
union
local
and
having
that
considered,
and
then
going
to
the
international
executive
board
through
mr.
fraser.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
45
days...
the
local
union
must
decide
in
45
days.
the
international
executive
board
is
required
to
use
its
best
efforts
to
decide
in
60
days,
and
of
course
each
time
there
has
to
be
a
step
to
get
the
appeal
filed
farther
up.
the
union
president,
mr.
fraser,
has
unfettered
discretion
to
take
a
case
over
and
decide
it
himself
whenever
he
thinks
it's
appropriate,
and
he
is
under
no
time
restraint.
the
top
level,
the
public
review
board
of
the
constitutional
committee
is
under
no
time
restraint.
and
in
that
connection,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'd
point
out
to
you
that
the
counsel
for
the
prb
has
said
that
this
appeal
structure
is
designed
to
produce
an
effective
decision
in
approximately
nine
months
to
approximately
12
months.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
this
case
has
been
over
five
years,
sir.
and
may
i
point
out
to
you
that
there
are
a
couple
of
judicial
experiences
with
this
time
thing.
in
ruzicka,
which
is
cited
very
much
in
my
opponent's
brief,
the
employee
had
gone
27
months
fruitlessly
without
a
remedy
under
the
uaw
procedure.
and
in
the
maxwell
case
we
cite
to
you,
the
employee
had
gone
17
months
fruitlessly
without
a
remedy.
and
i
say
that,
here,
clayton,
had
he
resorted
to
this
remedy,
no
matter
what
time
it
took,
it
would
have
been
fruitless
because
he
couldn't
have
got
the
relief
he
needs,
and
that
is
reinstatement.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
well,
he
had
hoped,
sir...
sir,
he
had
no
way
of
going
back
to
arbitration.
the
union
withdrew
the
case
from
arbitration
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
road.
he
had
to--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--oh,
i
think
what
that
was
addressed
to
was
this,
if
there
were
arbitration
after
this
litigation,
he
might
be
able
to
get--
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
--mr.
chief
justice,
at
that
point
he
could
have
had
no
arbitration
either
with
the
union
representing
him
or
with
private
counsel
representing
him.
the
grievance
was
over
with,
dead,
and
done,
and
that's
stipulated
to
by
all
the
parties
at
trial.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
exactly.
mr.
john
t.
mcternan
exactly.
thank
you.
