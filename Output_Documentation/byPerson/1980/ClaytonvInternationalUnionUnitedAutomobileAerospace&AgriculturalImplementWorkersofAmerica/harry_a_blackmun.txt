justice
blackmun
mr.
mcternan,
before
you
sit
down,
there's
been
called
to
my
attention
a
recent
2nd
circuit
case
decided
about
two
weeks
ago,
johnson
v.
general
motors.
are
you
familiar
with
that
one
at
all
and
how
it
bears
on
this?
justice
blackmun
it
might
be
worth
looking
into.
i'm
not
saying
it's
positive
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i
think
it
does
bear
on
this
issue.
justice
blackmun
dr.
whitman,
then,
these
upper
levels
of
the
union
appellate
process,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
that
you've
described,
is
the
employee
very
often
successful
after
defeats
in
the
lower
levels?
