justice
jr.
yes,
but
he
had
to
do
that,
didn't
he?
justice
jr.
right.
justice
jr.
no,
but
suppose
he
won't
do
it?
justice
jr.
and
then
what
happens
as
to
the
suit
against
the
employer?
dismiss
it?
justice
jr.
well,
what
would
an
attempt
have
involved,
mr.
whitman,
in
this
case?
justice
jr.
that's
all?
justice
jr.
the
president
of
the
uaw?
justice
jr.
and
does
he
then
act
on
it,
or
is
there
some--
justice
jr.
--nothing
of
this
nature
goes
to
the
general
convention,
annual
convention,
or
anything?
justice
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
initially,
the
first
step
would
have
to
be
a
letter
to
mr.
fraser?
justice
jr.
and
then
some
proceeding
occurs,
and
his
claim
is
rejected
at
that
level?
justice
jr.
then
he
has
to
go
to
one
or
the
other
of
two
other
levels,
does
he,
or
whatever
it
may
be?
justice
jr.
but
the
second
one
is
what,
about
six
months
or
more,
you
suggested,
to
get
to
the
appeals...
convention?
justice
jr.
does
the
union
permit
counsel
in
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
do
suggest
that
the
employee
says,
no,
i
don't
want
to
take
that
year
and
a
half
to
do
all
this,
i
want
to
go
ahead
with
my
lawsuit.
what
the
trial
judge
then
has
to
permit
him
to
do
is
still
establish,
if
he
can
in
the
suit
against
the
employer,
as
i
heard
you,
that
there
had
been
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
representation?
justice
jr.
no,
i
say,
you
do
suggest
that
the
employee
who
refuses
to
go
through
that
recourse
in
part
nevertheless
may
still
prove,
in
the
suit
against
the
employer--
justice
jr.
--the
breach
of
the
duty
of
representation?
justice
jr.
so,
to
that
extent,
failure
to
exhaust
does
not
deny
him
a
right
to
go
ahead
with
his
lawsuit,
at
least
against
the
employer?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
whitman,
i
don't
understand
your
suggestion
in
that
if
the
employee
refuses
to
exhaust,
that
means
he
can't
proceed
against
the
union,
but
nevertheless
he
may
proceed
against
the
employer.
why
should
he?
justice
jr.
if
he...
well,
i
gather
your
position
is
if
the...
he
made
no
attempt,
is
what
you
said.
justice
jr.
and
having
made
no
attempt,
he
has
no
further
course
of
action
against
the
unions.
then,
why,
nevertheless,
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
employer?
why
should
he,
if
the
union
is
to
be
off,
because
he
doesn't
exhaust
against
the
union?
why
shouldn't
the
employer
also
be?
because
if
he...
it
may
be
decided
in
the
exhaustion,
if
he
does
exhaust;
the
union
may
decide
and
he
may
even
agree
that
the
union
didn't
breach
its
duty
at
all.
justice
jr.
well,
it
won't
go
away
if
you
say
that
he
can
proceed
against
the
employer,
meanwhile.
your
position
is
that
he
doesn't
even
need
to
stay
the
action
against
the
employer.
he
just
can
go
right
ahead.
and
if
in
the
union
procedures
it's
decided
that
as
between
the
union
and
this
man
the
union
did
all
that
it
was
supposed
to
do,
why
shouldn't
the
employer
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
that?
justice
jr.
then,
i
really
don't
understand,
mr.
whitman,
why
you
can
take
the
position,
if
he
refuses
to
proceed
to
exhaust,
that
lets
the
union
off
but
not
also
the
employer?
justice
jr.
how
much
time
does
all
this
take,
mr.
mcternan?
