mr.
john
b.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
first
the
question
of
the
private
right
of
the
plaintiffs
to
bring
this
suit.
and
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
unlike
the
situation
of
the
plaintiff
in
the
amtrak,
the
touche
ross,
the
cannon,
and
the
transamerica
cases,
we
are
not
proposing
that
this
court
tried
to
discern
from
the
legislative
language
in
intent
to
create
a
new
and
different
private
cause
of
action
that
did
not
exist
before.
we
agree
that
the
test
here
is
legislative
intent.
and
unlike
the
dilemma
that
we
frequently
find
ourselves
in,
here,
we
are
able
to
gauge
legislative
intent
quite
accurately.
i
think
it's
possible
on
this
case
to
actually
determine
the
state
of
mind
of
the
congressman
who
enacted
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890,
which
was
the
predecessor
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
in
which
all
counsel
agree,
i
believe,
is
the
relevant
statute
for
determining
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
counsel
has
agreed
and
i
think
the
federal
defendants
have
acknowledged
in
their
brief
that
the
purpose
of
the
congress,
when
they
enacted
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890,
was
an
effect
to
overrule
a
decision
of
this
court
in
willamette
iron
bridge
company
versus
hatch.
for
that
reason,
i
think
it
instructed
to
go
back
to
willamette
iron
bridge
versus
hatch
and
examine
how
that
case
would
have
been
decided
with
the
change
that
was
brought
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890.
now,
willamette
iron
bridge
versus
hatch
was
a
suit
brought
by
a
citizen
of
oregon
against
another
citizen
of
oregon
to
obey
the
nuisance.
he
relied
upon
what
he
asserted
was
a
statute
of
the
united
states
that
rendered
unlawful
the
construction
of
a
bridge
that
obstructed
navigation.
he
said,
“that
bridge
is
a
nuisance
because
it
obstructs
navigation
and
it
is
made
unlawful
by
an
act
of
congress.”
mr.
john
b.
clark
he
did,
i
believe,
you
honor,
in
that
case
because
he
was
suing
in
a
federal
court
and
he
sought
a
federal
relief.
and
his
only
basis
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
but,
your
honor,
it's
only
a
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
was
between
the
citizens
of
the
same
state.
he
had
no
jurisdiction
in
federal
court,
unless
he
could
show
that
his
case
arose
under
a
federal
statute.
so,
he
relied
upon
that
statute
which
admitted
oregon
into
the
union
and
contained
some
language
that
--
that
recited
that
the
willamette
river
would
be
forever
free
for
navigation.
he
said,
the
construction
of
that
bridge
obstructed
navigation
and
it
provided
the
necessary
element
of
a
private
cause
of
action
for
nuisance,
that
is
that
the
obstruction
was
unlawful.
and
this
court
said
to
him,
just
as
it
had
said
in
a
string
of
very
similar
cases,
decided
in
the
19th
century
in
language
that
sounds
like
it
was
directed
at
congress
rather
than
to
the
private
litigants,
that
you
are
right
every
step
of
the
way
with
one
exception.
there
is
no
federal
statute
which
makes
the
obstruction
of
a
navigable
waterway
unlawful.
now,
that
was
the
culmination
of
a
series
of
cases.
many
of
which,
or
a
number
of
which
at
least,
came
to
this
court
and
were
decided
the
same
way,
and
within
two
years,
congress
had
enacted
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1890.
and
i
believe
that
what
congress
intended,
quite
clearly,
from
the
enactment
of
that
particular
statute,
was
to
put
mr.
hatch
in
the
position
where
if
that
lawsuit
had
been
brought
after
the
enactment
of
that
particular
law,
he
would
have
prevailed.
he
would
have
prevailed
on
the
theory
of
a
private
nuisance.
and
he
would
have
to
have
shown
that
he
was
specially
injured
just
as
anyone
would
have
to
have
done
at
that
point
in
time
and
today
in
order
to
prevail
on
a
claim
of
a
private
nuisance.
mr.
john
b.
clark
he
would
have,
your
honor.
he
would
have
had
to
show
some
sort
of
obstruction.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
obstruction
was
the
only
ground
of
nuisance
at
that
point
in
time.
there
were
other
things
one
could
do
to
a
river
that
constituted
nuisance,
but
he
would
have
to
have
shown
something
other
than
injury
to
himself.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
i
--
i
think
that's
true.
that
was
not
the
only
purpose
of
that
act,
i
would
submit
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
this
court
has
held,
in
the
standard
oil
case,
for
example,
that
congress
intended
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
nation
in
both
navigable
waterways
and
pure
waterways
when
it
enacted
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
in
addition
to
sections
10
and
12
upon
which
plaintiffs
rely
here,
it
also
enacted
a
number
of
other
sections
designed
to
prevent
dumping
and
pollution.
i
did
not
use
the
word
pollution
but
it
enacted
a
number
of
other
sections
designed
to
keep
our
waterways
clean.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
clark
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
your
honor,
that
is
largely
--
that
is
largely
to
--
it
arise
at
--
what
congress
intended
to
do
and
i
think
quite
clearly
intended
to
do
was
provide
a
federal
statute
so
that
this
kind
of
action
would,
in
fact,
arise
under
federal
law.
and
i
think
a
consideration
of
the
alternative
to
that
conclusion
indicates
very
strongly
why
congress
must
have
so
intend
it.
mr.
john
b.
clark
that
is
the
alternative,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
clark
i
think
it
would
be
controlled
by
federal
law
if
it
were
--
if
the
nuisance
actions
could
be
brought
in
state
courts.
but
we
would
not
have
a
uniform
development
of
the
law
in
that
particular
area.
the
interpretation
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
in
that
instance
would
be
left
to
all
the
superior
courts
and
--
and
state
courts
of
this
country.
mr.
john
b.
clark
your
honor,
i
--
that
may
be.
i
think
what
i'm
--
i'm
attempting
to
do
primarily
is
to
determine
what
congress
actually
intended.
however,
we
may
characterize
it
today.
i
think
it
is
true
and
i
think
it
is
the
most
logical
and
probable
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress
back
in
the
last
century
that
when
it
enacted
this
particular
law,
it
did
contemplate
the
bringing
of
actions
of
this
kind.
mr.
john
b.
clark
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
agree,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
b.
clark
no,
they
held
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
action.
mr.
john
b.
clark
they
said
it
was
not
clear.
yes,
as
--
as
the
opinion
was
written
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
i
think
it
is.
and
i
think
it
is
made
clear
in
part
by
the
further
research
that
has
been
done
in
preparation
for
this
particular
argument.
i
think
our
brief
lays
out
in
rather
extensive
detail.
the
consideration
is
not
only
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
but
the
contemporaneous
legal
context
in
which
this
statute
was
enacted.
it
was
somewhat
different
back
then
from
what
it
is
today.
and
as
we
have
attempted
to
argue
on
our
brief,
suits
by
private
suitors
were
the
norm,
and
enforcement
by
federal
agencies
was
the
exception.
that
has
--
that
has
somewhat
been
reversed
in
the
80
years
since
the
enactment
of
the
rivers
and
harbor
act
of
1899,
but
back
then
to
assume
that
private
suitors
would
be
able
to
enforce
this
particular
act,
was
not
unusual
at
all.
certainly,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
situation
that
this
court
was
confronted
with
in
the
recent
decisions
in
transamerica,
cannon,
and
so
on,
in
which
you
do
not
have
that
kind
of
background
and
you
are
attempting
to
determine
whether
congress,
when
it
enacted
a
new
regulatory
scheme,
intended
as
a
part
of
that
to
also
give
private
suitors
the
right
to
enforce
that
particular
new
law
that
was
not
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
no,
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
there
because
of
this
court's
pronouncements
that
we
look
to
congressional
intent.
the
intent
of
congress
that
is
relevant
starts
back
in
the
19th
century.
and
i
think
it
continues
to
this
very
day,
because
since
the
enactment
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
there
has
been
engrafted
upon
that
statute
a
number
of
additional
further
requirements
that
are
of
particular
importance
to
the
plaintiffs
who
bring
this
suit,
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act,
the
fish
and
wildlife
coordination
act,
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969,
the
national
estuarine
areas
act.
all
of
which,
to
one
extent
or
another,
must
be
taken
into
account
by
the
corp
of
engineers
when
it
passes
upon
applications
for
permits
and
exercises
its
jurisdiction
over
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
mr.
john
b.
clark
right.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
they
do.
mr.
john
b.
clark
well,
i
think
we
do,
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
one
of
the
concerns
of
our
clients
is
the
environment.
but
we
represent
clients
who
use
the
waters
of
the
delta
for
navigation
as
well
as
for
recreational
interest.
so
we
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
we
do.
mr.
john
b.
clark
hank
schramm,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
he
fishes
in
san
francisco
bay.
he
is
not
affected
by
the
lowering
of
water
levels
by
having
the
navigation
of
his
boat
impeded.
he,
however,
fishes
for
salmon.
eighty
percent
of
the
salmon
fishery
that
works
out
of
san
francisco
bay
is
entirely
dependent
upon
the
delta
environment
for
the
production
of
that
particular
anadromous
fish
that
goes
up
in
the
fresh
water,
lays
its
eggs,
and
fish
and
swims
out
into
the
salt
water
of
the
ocean.
so,
he
is
affected
and
he
has
a
very
serious
economic
interest
in
this
particular
action.
mr.
john
b.
clark
his
navigability
is
not
affected,
but
there
are
members
of
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
but
i
think
not.
but
--
let
me
assume
arguendo
though
that
it
is
concerned
exclusively
with
navigation.
in
that
instance,
we
would
be
required
to
show
in
effect
on
navigation
and
we
believe
we
have
done
that.
i
might
advise
the
court
of
one
factor
that
i
think
has
not
been
made
clear
in
the
past,
and
that
is
that
the
trial
below
was
a
bifurcated
trial.
and
the
court
entered
an
order
that
no
evidence
of
the
damage
caused
by
these
particular
diversions
should
be
admitted
until
the
second
phase
of
the
bifurcated
trial.
so,
the
issue
that
has
been
resolved
today
is
an
issue
of
standing.
now,
i
think
there
is
no
difference
between
standing
in
that
special
injury.
i
may
be
mistaken
in
that
regard,
but
at
the
very
least,
standing
to
bring
these
suits
in
a
special
injury
that
was
traditionally
required
in
a
private
nuisance
suit
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
that
--
that
may
well
be
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
we
allege,
mr.
justice
stevens
that
our
clients,
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
classes
used
the
delta
waters
for
boating
and
they
have
been
impeded.
mr.
john
b.
clark
i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
b.
clark
we'd
--
we'd
simply
allege
that
navigability
has
been
affected
and
there
has
been
minimal
proof
on
that
issue
through
the
first
phase
of
the
bifurcated
trial.
mr.
john
b.
clark
well,
we've
heard
this
morning
that
a
lowering
of
six
inches
affected
trade
on
the
great
lakes
by
300
million
tons
or
dollars.
i
know
that
figure.
i'm
probably
not
reciting
it
correctly.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
one
of
the
things
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
this
statute
is
that
neither
this
court
nor
any
other
court
should
be
determining
such
issues
as
whether
or
not
one
inch
of
lowered
water
level
at
one
particular
point
had
that
affect
on
navigation
that
would
trigger
the
effects
of
this
particular
act.
congress
said
that
is
the
role
of
the
corps
of
engineers
and
the
secretary
of
war
were
to
play.
and
that
the
initial
step
in
compliance
with
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
was
to
go
to
them
and
seek
a
permit
if
it
was
true
as
california
contends
that
there
is
nothing
in
their
proposed
and
continuing
diversions
of
water
that
is
prohibited
by
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
then,
in
that
event,
the
result
should
be
the
issuance
of
a
permit
forthwith.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
was
intended
to
operate,
but
the
state
of
california
and
to
date,
the
federal
defendants
have
chosen
not
to
comply
with
that
particular
law
insofar
as
it
applies
to
any
of
the
water
projects
that
divert
water
from
northern
california.
mr.
john
b.
clark
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
do
not
think
that's
correct.
i
think
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
mandamus
that
would
have
given
them
unlimited
right.
there
are
cases
in
which
private
suitors
have
sought
and
i
might
have
obtained
mandamus
against
the
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
no.
the
--
the
administrative
procedure
act,
of
course,
was
not
available.
but
what
people
in
fact
did
and
i
make
a
test
of
the
theory
that
i
advance
here
is
to
go
to
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
and
assert
actions
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
and
a
test
of
whether
my
analysis
of
congressional
intent
is
correct,
i
would
submit,
is
what
the
courts
in
fact
did
when
private
litigants
came
to
them
and
made
the
same
sort
of
claim
that
the
sierra
club
and
the
other
private
individual
plaintiffs
have
made
here.
they
treated
them
as
plaintiffs
who
had
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
and
they
granted
the
injunctive
kind
of
relief,
the
very
kind
of
relief
that
mr.
hatch
sought
against
willamette
iron
bridge
back
in
1886,
and
the
cases
the
chatfield
case,
the
carver
case
cited
in
our
brief
arose
under
very
similar
factual
situations.
mr.
john
b.
clark
that's
true
i
think,
you
honor.
they
--
they
are
not
from
this
court.
the
--
the
decision
of
this
court
that
probably
is
most
in
point
is
the
wyandotte
case
cited
in
cort
versus
ash
and
in
cannon
as
one
in
which
this
court
implied
a
right
of
action
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
to
be
true
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
in
cort
versus
ash,
that
was
cited
as
a
finding
of
a
--
of
a
case
that
stood
for
the
proposition
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
private
right
of
--
of
action
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
in
--
in
the
cannon
case,
that
characterization
was
moderated
somewhat
and
was
simply
one
in
which
this
court
noted
that
in
the
wyandotte
case,
it
had
implied
a
right
of
action.
it
was
not
specifically
provided
for
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
that
is
not
significantly
different
from
the
kind
of
relief
that
these
private
plaintiffs
seek
here.
and
i
think
there
is
a
little
reason
for
the
united
states
to
have
that
kind
of
relief
in
its
proprietary
capacity
and
yet
deny
that
same
kind
of
relief
to
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
above
sea
level,
your
honor?
i
--
i
believe
that
the
elevation
is
substantially
at
sea
level.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
mr.
john
b.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
clark
your
honor,
it
would
in
this
sense.
mr.
john
b.
clark
well,
i
disagree
with
your
premise
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
the
--
the
elevation
of
the
delta
pumping
plant
will
not
change.
and
if
it
is
at
sea
level,
that
is
where
it
is.
but
the
level
of
the
water
will
change
and
whatever
mean
low
or
lower
or
mean
low
or
high
water
may
be
at
any
particular
point
at
any
particular
time,
when
the
delta
pump
starts
to
pump
water,
the
water
levels
in
the
adjacent
waterways
goes
down.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
mr.
john
b.
clark
it
--
it
comes
back
in
some
time
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
the
quantity
is
adequate,
your
honor.
the
supply
--
the
quality
though
is
something
else.
mr.
john
b.
clark
if
we're
talking
navigation,
we
can
talk
navigation.
and
--
and
--
when
we
--
when
we
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
it
does
more
than
that.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
justice
white.
it
--
it
is
and
i
believe
that
that
quality
of
water
is
a
rivers
and
harbors
act
concern,
but
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
we
believe
the
plaintiff
satisfy
a
strictly
navigational
test.
if
this
court
were
to
say
you
cannot
assert
a
right
under
the
rivers
and
harbor
act
without
showing
that
you
were
privately
and
personally
affected
in
some
effort
to
navigate
these
waters,
we
think
we
can
show
that.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
a
correct
way
to
apply
the
act.
we
think
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
clark
we
don't
accept
the
premise
but
we
also
are
under
an
order
that
defers
until
the
second
phase
of
a
bifurcated
trial
all
proof
of
the
damage
caused
by
--
to
these
plaintiffs
by
these
particular
diversions.
mr.
john
b.
clark
well,
your
honor,
that
is
simply
the
way
this
case
has
--
has
gotten
up
to
this
particular
court.
i
don't
think
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
no,
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
that's
right
and
that
--
and
he
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
we
had
satisfied
those
tests
on
the
record
--
on
the
record
before
those
courts.
and
i
--
i
think
the
record
is
sufficient.
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
no.
i
don't
think
you
could
dismiss
these
plaintiffs
on
the
ground
that
in
the
middle
of
the
--
of
the
trial,
a
trial
that
was
specifically
deferred
until
the
second
phase,
certain
elements
of
proof.
i
don't
think
you
can
dismiss
now
on
the
ground
that
those
deferred
elements
have
proof
had
not
yet
been
proven.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes,
of
course.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
mr.
john
b.
clark
well,
i
think
that
in
examination,
the
record
will
show
that
there
is
ample
proof
in
the
record
of
an
actual
injury
to
navigation.
that
issue
has
not
been
argued
on
appeal.
the
--
the
issue
that
has
been
raised
is
whether
there
is
a
private
right.
mr.
john
b.
clark
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
john
b.
clark
it
may
be.
our
--
and
i
would
emphasize
that
the
lower
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
was
an
obstruction
to
navigation.
that
was
a
--
a
factual
founding
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
no,
not
--
the
evidence
on
which
that
was
based,
is
not
confined
to
a
lowering
of
one
inch.
that
was
the
counsel's
statement.
the
record
shows
that
the
lowering
of
water
levels
is
18
inches
at
some
points
under
the
present
amount
of
pumping.
and
one
last,
bear
in
mind
that
the
present
pumping
is
far
less
than
the
volume
of
pumping
contemplated
by
these
particular
defendants.
mr.
john
b.
clark
yes.
they
proposed
substantial
additional
pumping.
mr.
john
b.
clark
no,
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
i
think
you're
wrong,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
b.
clark
just
the
proof,
your
honor,
that
water
levels
have
been
reduced
and
that
the
plaintiffs
used
the
--
the
waters
of
the
delta
for
boating
and
other
purposes.
there
are
--
i
believe
that
--
mr.
john
b.
clark
i
--
i
think
that
is
the
fact,
mr.
justice,
but
i
don't
believe
that's
the
state
of
proof
at
this
stage
of
the
trial
down
below.
we
are
under
an
order
of
the
court
that
it
was
issued
at
the
time
the
interveners
were
granted
the
right
to
intervene
that
said
that
--
that
proof
of
the
effect
of
these
diversions
would
be
deferred
until
the
second
phase
of
the
trial.
so,
although
that
the
record
happens
to
have
a
substantial
quantity
of
evidence
on
the
effect
of
these
diversions,
it
is
there
largely
because
it
is
an
evidence
introduced
for
other
purposes.
and
the
proof
of
the
extent
of
the
effect
of
these
diversions
has
been
deferred
until
the
second
phase.
i
might
mention
that,
while
i'm
on
this
point,
that
we
take
the
position
that
in
terms
of
substantive
proof,
substantive
application
of
the
act
itself,
we
must
only
show
that
--
that
the
defendants
are
engaged
in
conduct
--
in
the
kind
of
conduct
referred
to
in
the
second
or
third
clauses
of
the
--
of
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
and
a
showing
of
--
of
that
fact
is
sufficient
to
require
a
ruling
that
they
seek
a
proper
permit
and
approval
from
the
corps
of
engineers.
mr.
john
b.
clark
assuming
we
have
a
private
cause
of
action.
thank
you.
