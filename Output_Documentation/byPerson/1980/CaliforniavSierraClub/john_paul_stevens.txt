justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there
for
a
moment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
not
properly
do
so
because
its
only
interest
in
the
allocation
would
be
in
protecting
the
navigable,
the
interest
in
free
--
free
navigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
review
the
facts
and
say,
“well,
the
only
thing
that
is
at
stake
here
is
an
inch's
change
in
the
water
table,”
or
something
like
that,
wouldn't
we
expect
them
to
grant
the
current
system?
they
would
not
deny
it
because
they
think
it
would
rather
have
stock
and
have
the
business
in
san
joaquin
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
corps
of
engineers
say
they
are
going
to
build
a
bridge
across
the
river
and
somebody
says
they
have
got
to
have
a
permit,
do
you
think
they
could
deny
the
permit
if
they
found
that
there
would
be
no
interference
with
navigation
but
they
just
didn't
think
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
build
a
bridge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
don't,
how
can
we
possibly
reach
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
status
of
the
permit
application?
first,
did
you
--
i
know
you've
done
it
under
protest,
but
did
they
cover
the
peripheral
canal
as
well
as
the
operation
of
the
delta
pumping
plant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
was
just
wondering
why.
but
has
the
--
what
is
happening
with
the
delta
public
plant
right
now?
is
it
operating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
application
was
made
for
the
peripheral
canal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
(voice
overlap)
possibly
no
application
necessary
for
the
delta
pumping
plant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
that's
all
the
more
reason
to
go
ahead
with
the
permit
application,
we've
got
plenty
of
time
to
see
what
the
army
corps
of
engineers
thinks
about
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
position
as
i
have
it
clear
in
the
case
that
justice
white
proposes
that
the
proper
procedure
that
congress
intended
was
sued
in
the
state
court.
if
you
lose
there,
then
you
can
appeal
for
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
which
would
construe
section
--
the
rivers
and
harbors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you're
not
just
saying
that
no
(inaudible)
because
there
is
just
no
remedy
under
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
there's
a
private
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
they
could
prevent
them
and
could
they
go
into
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
prevent
a
state
court
from
saying,
“well,
we
--
we
think
if
you
violate
the
federal
statute,
we
are
to
give
a
remedy.”
is
there
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
find
they're
in
violation
of
federal
law
that
you
said
there's
no
federal
remedy,
why
can't
the
state
provide
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
--
even
as
in
respects
--
an
action
in
a
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
clark,
may
i
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
putting
the
case
back
in
the
1890
context,
which
you
asked
us
to
do,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
the
private
plaintiff
would
have
had
alleged
something
that
can't
be
a
private
nuisance.
it's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
a
very
direct
entry
to
himself
as
on
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
do
your
clients
qualify
that
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
the
one
that
best
qualifies
in
the
said
--
assuming
that
you
don't
have
the
obstruction
to
navigation,
as
i
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
allege
that
their
use
of
the
waters
for
navigation
would
be
impaired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
schramm,
he
was
in
san
francisco
bay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
his
navigability
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference.
it
seems
to
me
the
inability
to
get
salmon
would
be
satisfied
in
article
3
standing
requirement.
but
he
wouldn't
have
constituted
an
impediment
to
your
ability
to
navigate
where
we
want
to
navigate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
on
the
record
that
indicates
that
any
of
your
clients,
by
reason
of
what
your
adversaries
are
doing,
cannot
navigate
in
the
way
they
like
to
navigate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
you
can't
go
because
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't
have
interrupted.
finish
your
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
lowering
the
water
cable
a
few
inches
would
satisfy
the
requirement.
if
you
can
still
navigate
it
in
any
place,
you
could
previously
navigate
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
trying
to
say
you
think
you
can't
show
it.shouldn't
you
have
shown
that
from
the
first
day
of
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
accepted
the
premise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
--
if
you're
looking
at
the
remedy,
that's
certainly
a
normal
way
to
bifurcate
a
trial.
if
you're
looking
at
authority
to
proceed
with
litigation,
it's
a
rather
strange
bifurcation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
first
issue
addressed
by
both
judge
renfrew
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
private
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
isn't
sufficient
if
you're
saying
unless
we
can
prove
it
if
you
let
us
go
back
and
do
it
in
the
second
stage
of
the
trial.
but
don't
we
have
to
take
the
record
as
it's
made
up
to
now?
