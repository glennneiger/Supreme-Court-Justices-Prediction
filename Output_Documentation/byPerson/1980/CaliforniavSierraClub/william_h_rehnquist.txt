justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
central
valley
project
was
authorized
before
the
federal
--
the
federal
government
made
any
contribution
to
it
all,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
federal
common
law,
do
you
mean
something
different
than
a
construction
of
section
10
just
to
overrule
erie
against
tompkins?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
delta,
does
that
go
up
as
far
as
stockton?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
corps
of
engineers
could
override
the
provisions
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
could?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
--
did
this
lawsuit
originate
as
a
suit
by
the
corps
of
engineers
against
the
state
of
california
or
was
it
a
privately
instituted
lawsuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
the
federal
corps
--
corps
of
engineers
acting
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
was
not
complaining
about
what
california
was
doing
by
way
of
diversion
of
truth
--
the
tracy
plant
and
so
forth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
--
how
much
of
this
is
speculation,
as
long
as
the
corps,
with
this
broad
body
of
regulations,
was
simply
leaving
you
alone
until
a
--
a
private
cause
of
action
was
asserted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
why
do
you
think
the
corps
of
engineers
did
not
take
the
position
that
the
delta
plant
required
a
permit
before
this
lawsuit
was
brought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
--
to
say
disposing
of
it
on
procedural
grounds,
i
mean
if
the
person
who
initiated
the
lawsuit
was
not
authorized
by
congress
to
initiate
the
lawsuit,
that's
scarcely
procedural
grounds,
or
call
it
what
you
will.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
always
wait
for
the
tenth
circuit
to
speak
again.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
because
the
state
was
a
party.
and
when
states
are
parties,
this
court
has
original
jurisdiction
and
we
have
to
fashion
a
body
of
common
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
--
and
your
--
your
position
here
as
a
respondent
is
supporting
the
judgment
below?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn't
the
corps
bring
its
own
action
if
it
wants
this
case
affirmed
on
the
merits
if
it's
determined
that
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
this
--
this
very
expert
body
let
this
mischief,
if
it
be
a
mischief
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
go
on
for
--
unchecked
for
a
long
period
of
time
until
its
attention
was
called
to
it
by
a
private
litigants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
even
with
speaking
on
matters
of
faith
and
morals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
that's,
always
been
a
highly
contested
matter
within
the
executive
branch
as
it
not,
whether
or
not
the
department
of
justice
show
control
with
the
litigation
of
federal
claims
or
whether
other
agencies
within
the
executive
branch
shall
have
right
to
their
own
--
records.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
diversion
from
a
navigable
river
is
made
by
a
person
who
asked
for
a
permit
from
the
corps
of
engineers
and
they
say,
“well,
you
don't
need
a
permit.
and
i
will
give
you
a
permit
and
you
still
need
one.”
and
the
person
--
somebody
downstream
says,
“well,
you
did
need
a
permit.
furthermore,
the
water
level
is
lowered
and
i
can't
get
water
on
the
river
anymore
in
my
distribution
system.”
so,
he
wants
to
sue
for
damage.
he
wants
to
sue
for
injunction.
he
wants
damages
and
he
wants
it
adjudicated
that
a
permit
was
required.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
argument
still
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
--
why
would
i
ask
you?
does
he
have
--
does
your
same
argument
applied
to
a
damages
action
brought
by
a
private
individual
under
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
because
it
has
been
under
controlled
in
the
department
of
justice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
1890,
act
of
1899
--
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
--
what
if
one
--
one
were
to
find
a
conflict
between
the
reclamation
act
of
1902
and
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
section
1
saying
that
the
project
should
be
constructed
and
conformed
there
with
state
law
and
--
i
don't
remember
the
language.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
don't
--
don't
you
at
least
have
to
look
at
the
two
together?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
didn't
need
to
add
libel,
did
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
it
was
a
nuisance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
nuisance
because
it
was
obstructing
navigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
show
that
the
navigability
of
the
navigable
stream
was
obstructed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
i
read
the
1890
act,
it's
based
in
terms
of
the
federal
interest
being
obstructions
to
navigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
reading
the
arising
under
jurisdiction
much
like
the
savings
to
suitors
in
admiralty
clause
in
the
constitution
as
if
it
were
preserving
a
particular
right
rather
than
simply
allowing
congress
to
create
rise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet,
you're
--
you're
relying
on
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
as
granting
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
concerned
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
exclusively
with
navigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
--
if
--
if
you
want
to
take
us
back
to
the
1890s
as
you
have
on
for
some
purposes,
wasn't
it
true
in
the
1890s
and
for
many
decades
thereafter
that
no
private
claimant
would
have
had
any
--
any
right
to
challenge
the
action
of
the
corps
of
engineers
in
refusing
or
in
granting
a
permit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
nothing
like
the
administrative
procedure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
of
those
are
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
pacific
ocean
is
a
pretty
adequate
supply.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
place
they
can't
go
or
couldn't
go
when
this
thing
were
--
were
built
--
was
built
that
they
can
go
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
private
cause
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
barnacles
accumulated
a
lot
--
a
lot
faster
on
sailing
vessels.
