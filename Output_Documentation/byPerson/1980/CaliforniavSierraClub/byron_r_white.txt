justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
--
if
we
said
there
was
no
private
cause
of
action,
i
suppose
you
would
set
aside
all
the
opinions
and
the
judgments
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
you
win
then
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
corps
of
engineers
might
tend
to
say
--
might
--
might
say
to
you
i
might
bring
an
action
to
join
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
delta
plant
is
in
--
needs
a
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
(inaudible)
got
to
be
a
party
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that
technically,
in
the
district
court,
the
united
states
might
have
--
might
have
counterclaimed
or
cross-claimed
against
one
of
the
defendants
against
you
to
employ
the
delta
plant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
hasn't
--
it
hasn't
done
that
until
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
what
if
it
filed
a
--
what
if
it
filed
--
that's
said
in
this
brief
here,
“we
would
like
the
case
remanded
so
we
can
file
a
crossclaim,”
or,
“please
accept
this
as
a
crossclaim.”
justice
byron
r.
white
because
your
--
your
fear
at
the
moment
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
may
never
--
if
it's
a
hot
political
issue,
we
may
never
have
to
reach
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
conceded
in
the
case
that
there
is
an
article
iii
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
the
case
of
controversy
between
these
plaintiffs
and
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
you
--
you
want
it
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
plaintiffs
are
the
sierra
club,
friends
of
the
earth,
hank
schramm,
a
fisherman,
and
dixon,
a
landowner.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
stakes
in
this
controversy
do
any
of
those
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
take
this
position
with
respect
to
the
delta
plant
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
no,
it
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
did
not
press
this
argument
about
the
delta
plant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
neither
did
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
crossclaim
against
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
could
have
done,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
--
could
you
suggest
that
injunctive
proceedings
under
17
might
be
brought
only
by
the
department
of
justice.
how
about
corp
of
engineers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
request,
but
can
justice
turn
on
them?
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
some
are
really
with
interior?
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
judge,
state
judges
were
--
not
all
to
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
be,
impudent.
i
have
to
say
docks
or
--
some
--
some
arenas
are
usable.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
--
can
i
ask
you
about
the
elevation
of
the
tracy
plant
or
the
delta
plant
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
i
suppose
you
diverted
entirely
the
sacramento
river
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
above
the
delta
plant.
if
it's
substantially
at
sea-level,
then
there
would
be
just
as
much
water
at
the
delta
plant.
they
would
think
it's
at
the
seawater.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
wouldn't
affect
navigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you'll
be
still
--
if
the
water
level
would
be
set
substantially
the
same
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
you
how
high
it
was
instead
of
substantially
sea
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
goes
down
until
it's
replaced
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
seawater.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we
were
talking
about
navigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
changes
the
character
of
the
river
from
breakwater
to
seawater,
which
is
a
substantial
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
rivers
and
harbors
act
concern?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
a
jurisdictional
question
just
bifurcating
that
trial,
it
doesn't
give
this
court
some
jurisdiction
it
doesn't
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
i
disagree
with
renfrew
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could
just
disagree
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there
was
--
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
private
point,
or
i
suppose
we
could
say
that
disagree
with
them
that
the
threshold
showing
of
any
injury
to
these
people,
showing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
was
not
the
obstruction
in
navigation
something
that
was
yet
to
be
built
in
the
peripheral
canal
and
that
there
is
no
showing
that
that
particular
obstruction
interfered
with
your
client's
ability
to
navigate?
justice
byron
r.
white
am
i
wrong
at
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
in
the
record
just
so
i
can
pinpoint
something
on
which
if
you
had
to
rely
on
the
present
records,
what
could
you
point
to,
to
say
that
there
is
anything
showing
any
interference
with
any
of
your
client's
present
ability
to
navigate?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
--
would
you
have
the
same
--
does
this
change
in
fresh
water
to
salt
water
would
not,
for
example,
would
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
true
that
the
--
that
the
delta
pumping
plant
will
reduce
the
level
of
the
--
of
the
water
in
the
river
at
that
point
and
--
and
down
river
to
a
certain
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
that
may
be
but
that's
--
that
--
that's
just
maybe
by
happenstance,
i
mean,
it
could
have
been
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yet,
i
have
something
to
talk
about
this.
we're
talking
about
logs
or
anything
else
or
--
or
canoes.
justice

section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
statute
which
dates
from
1899
forbids
any
obstructions
to
any
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
unless
the
obstruction
is
specifically
approved
by
congress.
this
action
began
when
various
private
plaintiffs
sought
an
injunction
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
claiming
that
section
10
would
be
violated
by
various
water
storage
and
transportation
projects
that
would
be
part
of
the
california
water
project
and
that
would
serve
to
bring
water
from
northern
california
to
the
central
and
southern
parts
of
the
state.
a
threshold
issue
was
whether
or
not
section
10
affords
private
parties
a
cause
of
action
to
remedy
alleged
violations
of
the
proscriptions
of
the
statute.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
section
10
did
afford
such
a
private
relief.
we
are
unanimously
of
the
contrary
opinion
and
our
reasons
for
being
of
this
view
and
for
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
that
i
have
filed
expressing
the
views
of
five
justices
and
a
concurring
opinion
filed
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
and
in
a
--
an
opinion
concurring
the
judgment
filed
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
who
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice's
stewart
and
powell,
and
because
we
--
of
our
ruling
on
the
private
cause
of
action
which
we
have
no
occasion
to
reach
the
merits
despite
the
request
that
we
do
so.
so
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
