mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
walston.
mr
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
very
important
issues
of
federalism
with
respect
to
the
control
of
water
resources
in
the
west.
there
are
actually
two
major
issues
raised
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
the
first
question
is
whether
under
section
10
of
that
act,
the
army
corps
of
engineers
has
authority
to
override
state
water
rights
laws
even
where
there
are
no
impacts
upon
federal
navigation
interest.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
1899
act
affords
a
private
right
of
action
that
is
available
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
is
indeed.
i've
arranged
them
chronologically,
justice
stewart,
for
the
reason
that
i
will
argue
only
the
first
question
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--
because
we
did
not
raise
the
second
issue
in
our
briefs.
the
united
states
will
argue
the
second
issue
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--
in
--
in
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
briefly,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
very
complicated
but
i
--
i
will
try
to
just
very
briefly
skip
over
them
as
i
may.
the
case
involves
water
exports
by
the
state
water
project
which
is
a
massive
reclamation
project
in
california
that
essentially
exports
waters
from
the
northern
part
of
the
state
to
the
central
and
the
southern
parts
of
the
state.
the
projects
actually
release
waters
to
flow
downstream
in
to
the
sacramento-san
joaquin
delta
and
then
pumping
plants
on
the
south
into
the
delta,
pump
the
waters
to
the
users
in
central
and
southern
california.
the
--
this
project
is
extremely
vital
to
california's
economic
health.
it
provides
water
to
supply
to
about
14
million
people,
which
is
over
half
of
california's
population.
it
provides
irrigation
water
to
about
one
million
acres
of
prime
agricultural
land
and
in
fact,
the
state
project
has
been
in
operation
since
1967,
so
it's
been
exporting
water
in
that
--
since
that
period.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
correct.
the
central
valley
project
is
a
federal
reclamation
facility
that
essentially
parallels
the
state
facility
and
it's
been
operational
since
the
1930s.
the
--
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
10
of
the
act
authorizes
the
corps
of
engineers
to
control
the
allocation
of
water
from
this
project,
as
i
say,
pursuant
to
section
10
of
the
act.
the
section
10
essentially
contains
two
clauses
here
before
the
court.
the
first
clause
is,
in
our
view,
of
the
major
clause.
it
establishes
a
general
prohibition
against
obstructions
to
navigable
capacity
without
the
approval
of
congress.
and
the
third
clause
makes
it
unlawful
to
alter
the
condition
of
navigable
waters
without
the
approval
of
the
army
corps
of
engineers.
and
the
state's
argument
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows.
section
10,
in
our
view,
applies
only
where
there's
an
effect
on
navigable
capacity
as
that
term
is
used
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
clause.
and
therefore,
section
10
applies
only
where
there
is
an
effect
upon
federal
navigation
interest.
now,
the
question,
“does
section
10
apply
to
water
allocations
that
are
adopted
by
the
states
under
the
water
rights
laws?”
and
on
that
question,
we
raise
essentially
two
alternative
arguments.
first,
we
argue
that
section
10
does
not
apply
to
state
water
allocations
at
all.
second,
we
argue
that
if
the
--
if
section
10
does
apply
in
that
context,
the
court
should
develop
a
kind
of
common
law
or
rule
of
reason
test
governing
its
meaning
in
that
kind
of
situation.
then,
in
this
rule
of
reason
test,
we
argue
that
section
10
should
apply
to
state
water
allocations
only
where
there
is
a
substantial
effect
upon
the
capacity
of
waters
to
support
actual
navigation
in
the
area
where
commerce
actually
takes
place.
to
state
it
very
briefly,
we
argue
that
section
10
applies
only
where
--
to
state
water
allocations
only
where
there
is
a
substantial
effect
upon
federal
navigation
interest
and
concerns.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
our
analysis.
it
held
that
section
10
applies
even
though
--
whenever
there
is
an
effect
on
the
condition
of
navigable
waters,
even
though
there
are
maybe
no
effect
on
navigation
or
navigable
capacity.in
other
words,
section
10
applies
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
federal
navigation
interest.
and
it
further
held
that
section
10
fully
applies
to
state
water
allocations
and
that
the
court
should
not
develop
any
kind
of
common
law
or
rule
of
reason
test
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
section
10
in
that
situation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no.
we
mean
precisely
a
construction
of
section
10,
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
the
same
construction
of
section
10
indeed
that
this
court
rendered
in
1899
in
the
rio
grande
case.
and
at
that
time,
the
court
held
that
the
section
10
applies
only
where
there
is
a
substantial
effect
on
navigable
capacity
in
an
area
where
navigation
is
a
recognized
set.
that's
precisely
the
language
of
the
court's
decision,
so
the
court
in
the
case
appeared
to
adapt
a
rule
of
reason
test
which
we
regard
as
kind
of
a
common
law
test.
if
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
section
10
is
correct,
then
we
concede
that
section
10
fully
applies
here,
for
the
water
exports
in
this
case,
do
affect
the
condition
of
navigable
waters
and
we
can
see
that.
but
if
our
interpretation
of
section
10
is
correct,
then
section
10
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
the
state
water
project
exports
in
this
case
do
not
substantially
affect
navigable
capacity
in
that
part
of
the
delta
where
commerce
actually
takes
place.
the
exports
at
most
reduced
water
levels
in
the
delta
by
only
about
one
inch
in
that
part
of
the
delta
where
commerce
actually
takes
place.
and
this
reduction
has
no
substantial
effect
on
actual
federal
navigation
interest
in
that
part
of
the
delta.
now,
a
rule
of
reason
test
is
in
--
is
in
essence
in
an
attempt
to
accommodate
conflicting
your
belief,
potentially
conflicting
goals
in
the
subjects
--
on
the
subjects
of
navigation
and
reclamations.
specifically,
we
are
urging
this
court
to
attempt
in
accommodation
between
federal
navigation
interest
on
the
one
hand
and
the
congressional
policy
on
the
other
hand
by
deferring
to
the
water
right
laws
and
the
water
supply
system
that
have
been
developed
by
the
western
states.
indeed,
the
very
purpose
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
was
to
prevent
obstructions
to
navigable
capacity.
thus,
to
protect
federal
environmental
concern
--
federal
navigation
concerns.
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
--
that
act
was
passed
for
the
very
purpose
of
overcoming
this
court's
decision
in
the
willamette
bridge
case,
a
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
there
is
no
federal
common
law
with
respect
to
obstructions
to
navigation.
therefore,
in
our
view,
the
1899
act
should
be
applied
at
least
in
this
situation
only
where
there
is
an
effect,
an
actual
effect
on
actual
visible
federal
navigation
interest.
and
this
result,
we
believe,
is
reinforced
by
the
--
the
concept
that
congress
has
historically
delegated,
brought
authority
and
control
to
the
western
states
to
control
their
water
rights
system.
this
delegation
of
authority
is
based
upon
several
laws
that
were
passed
by
congress,
both
this
century
and
then
the
prior
century
relating
to
the
subjects
of
reclamation,
dessert
lands,
mining
and
a
vast
array
of
other
types
of
subject
matters.
and
under
this
delegation
of
authority,
the
western
states
have
actually
developed
administrative
water
rights
systems
in
which
they
have
been
trying
and
successfully
trying
to
control
and
manage
their
water
resources.
and
indeed,
the
water
exports
in
this
very
case
have
been
authorized
under
california's
own
water
right
system.
california's
own
water
right
system
is
controlled
by
the
state
water
resources
control
board,
which
has
authorized
the
allocation
of
the
exports
of
water
in
this
case,
subject
however,
to
conditions
that
were
intended
to
protect
the
environmental
quality
of
the
delta
itself.
these
state
water
allocation
systems
that
have
been
developed
by
the
westerns
states
are
absolutely
vital
to
their
economic
growth
and
prosperity.
the
west
is
unique
in
many
ways
and
congress
has
dealt
with
it
--
with
the
west
in
a
unique
way.
the
west
has
much
land
but
very
little
water
and
so,
the
western
states
have,
in
affect,
developed
reclamation
systems
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
water
from
where
it
originates,
to
where
it
may
be
used,
and
where
it
is
needed
by
human
beings.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes
it
does,
mr.
justice.
the
--
under
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
the
corps
of
engineers
however,
can
over
--
could
override
potentially
any
state
water
allocation
that
is
authorized
under
state
water
rights
laws
as
long
as
there
is
a
--
an
effect
on
the
condition
of
navigable
waters,
even
though
there
are
maybe
no
affect
whatsoever
upon
navigation
or
navigable
capacity.
well,
in
practical
reality,
most
state
water
allocations
affect
the
condition
of
navigable
waters.
thus,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
would
allow
the
--
the
corps
of
engineers
essentially
to
control
most
water
allocations
that
are
authorized
under
the
water
rights
laws
of
the
western
states.
if
this
is
so,
then
the
corps
of
engineers
would
function
as
kind
of
a
super
water
agency
in
the
west.
it
would
be
responsible
for
ultimately
controlling
the
--
the
diversion
of
water
and
the
division
of
water
among
competing
economic
and
environmental
interest
in
the
western
states.
for
example,
it
could
--
it
could
determine
the
allocation
of
water
between
competing
agricultural
groups
or
between
competing
urban
groups
or
between
competing
agricultural
and
urban
users.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes
sir.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
would
be
our
position,
justice
stevens,
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
corps
of
engineers
could
go
beyond
that
situation
and
could
control
water
allocations
even
where
there
is
no
effect
upon
federal
navigation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
control
only
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
get
a
permit
before
you
go
forward?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
it's
difficult
to
say
exactly
what
the
corps
--
the
corps
of
engineers
would
do
with
that
kind
of
situation.
but
under
the
corps
of
engineers'
regulations,
it
could
look
to
any
public
interest
factor
in
determining
whether
the
water
should
be
used
for
one
purpose
or
the
other.
in
other
words,
the
state
would
determine
if
the
water
should
be
used
by
one
particular
group
of
farmers
in
one
particular
region.
and
under
the
court
of
appeal's
decision,
the
corps
of
engineers
could
effectively
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
justice
stevens.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
we
don't
believe
that.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
corps
of
engineers
is
not
governed
by
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
this
whole
court
held
recently
in
california
versus
united
states
that
section
8
of
that
1902
act
is
the
state's
very
broad
control
of
reclamation,
but
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
that
question
and
said
that
the
--
that
the
state's
power
simply
does
not
apply
in
any
situation
where
the
corps
of
engineers
is
exercising
its
powers
under
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
in
effect,
the
court
of
appeals
read
section
8
out
of
the
act
insofar
as
it
applies
to
water
diversions
that
might
fall
within
the
parameters
of
the
corps
of
engineers'
authority
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
to
pursue
the
point,
the
--
the
power
that
is
thus
given
to
the
corps
of
engineers
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
immensely
broad.
the
corps
could
determine
for
example
that
it's
better
for
los
angeles
to
achieve
warm
and
growth
than
for
california
central
--
central
valley
to
produce
more
food
or
to
determine
just
the
opposite.
and
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
corps
of
engineers
can
make
that
determination
irrespective
of
the
effect
upon
federal
navigation
interests
and
concerns.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
legislative
history
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899
that
provides
any
indication
that
congress
ever
intended
for
such
a
massive
federal
intrusion
into
an
area
that
has
been
traditionally
regulated
by
the
states
themselves.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
was
a
privately
instituted
lawsuit.
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
are
the
sierra
club
and
other
groups
in
and
around
the
sacramento-san
joaquin
delta.
the
corps
of
engineers
--
or
i
should
say
to
be
more
precise,
certain
federal
officials
were
viewed
as
co-defendants
along
with
the
state
of
california.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
the
corps
of
engineers
was
not
complaining
at
all.
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
this
is
a
private
lawsuit
brought
by
the
sierra
club
and
other
private
groups
against
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
the
corps
of
engineers'
own
regulations,
by
the
way,
provide
an
indication
of
the
broad
--
the
potential
breadth
to
the
corps'
authority
over
the
state
water
rights
systems
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
western
states.
under
the
corps'
own
regulations,
the
corps
is
authorized
to
consider
any
factor
relating
to
the
public
interest,
“public
interest”
and
the
process
of
approving
or
denying
a
permit
application.
and
the
regulations
even
define
the
factors
that
relate
to
the
public
interest.
and
these
factors
are,
among
other
things,
water
supply,
food
production,
land
use,
aesthetics.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
the
--
what
position
the
united
states
and
the
corps
of
engineers
would
now
take
with
respect
to
the
state
water
diversions
in
this
case,
(voice
overlap)
the
court
of
appeals
decision
--
sorry?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
precisely
the
--
the
--
that's
--
that's
the
point.
prior
to
this
lawsuit,
the
corps
of
engineers
had
never
complained
about
the
state
water
diversions
and
had
not
sought
to
exercise
any
kind
of
jurisdiction
over
them.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
but
now
we
know
exactly
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
stewart.
and
for
that
reason,
we
would
strongly
urge
that
this
court
reach
the
merits
of
the
case
regardless
of
what
disposition
it
might
make
with
respect
to
the
procedural
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--
have
a
point
of
(inaudible)
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
how
could
we?
if
there
is
no
private
right
of
action,
how
possibly
could
we
reach
the
merits?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
perhaps
you
could
not,
justice
stewart,
but
we
would
--
we
would
hope
that
the
court
might
actually
form
something
in
the
way
of
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
the
court
has,
on
occasion,
made
alternative
holdings.
and
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
we
would
look
to
in
this
case
if
the
court
upholds
our
private
right
of
action.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
perhaps
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
we
wouldn't
really
win,
justice
white,
because
we
have
to
go
back
to
california
and
then
we
wouldn't
know
whether
we
are
subject
to
corps
--
the
corps
of
engineers'
jurisdiction
or
not.
we
wouldn't
know
that
for
several
years
until
the
case
got
back
to
this
court,
and
in
the
meantime,
we
really
wouldn't
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
i
would
assume
that
the
corps
of
engineers
in
the
future
would
take
the
same
position
that
is
taking
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
as
now.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right,
and
then
we
would
obviously
take
the
same
position
that
we
take
now
to
the
effect
that
the
--
that
the
pumping
plants
do
not
need
a
permit.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
simply
have
no
idea,
justice
rehnquist.
you
may
want
to
ask
united
states
that
question.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
that's
correct.
we
have
applied
for
a
permit
in
this
case,
but
only
under
protest
and
in
response
to
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
in
this
case,
but
we
do
--
our
application
has
been
under
protest.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
federal
defendants
were
sued
because
the
sierra
club
claimed
that
the
federal
central
valley
project
also
needed
permits
approved
by
the
corps
of
engineers
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
in
other
words,
there
are
really
two
reclamation
projects
before
this
court.
one
is
a
federal
project
that
was
developed
and
built
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
--
it
might
have
done
that
and
in
light
of
its
presence
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no.
and
in
light
of
its
present
position,
i
would
expect
that
it
should
have
done
that,
but
i
think
it
did
not
do
that
for
the
reason
that
it's
positioned
on
the
--
on
the
issues
in
this
case
was
apparently
not
clear
at
the
time
of
the
district
court
action.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that.
we
--
we
want
to
reach
the
merits
in
any
way
that's
possible
and
if
that's
--
if
that
--
if
the
merits
can
be
reached
that
way,
then
we
would
welcome
that
alternative.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
right.
they
will
be
addressing
this
--
the
court
shortly.
but
if
the
court
doesn't
reach
the
merits
of
the
case,
we
will,
as
i
say,
be
operating
the
state
water
project
for
the
next
few
years
without
really
knowing
whether
we
are
required
to
obtain
a
permit
or
not.
and
the
same
will
apply
with
respect
to
the
peripheral
canal
which
is
one
of
the
current
hottest
political
issues
in
california.
we
simply
don't
know
at
this
point,
and
we
won't
know
until
this
court
resolves
the
question
whether
we
are
required
to
obtain
a
permit
for
the
peripheral
canal
or
not.
and
we
--
apparently,
if
the
court
disposes
of
this
case
on
procedural
grounds,
the
matter
won't
be
resolved
until
like
a
new
case.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
it's
always
a
possibility.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
perhaps
your
point
is
correct
but
whatever
the
grounds,
the
approach
to
your
suggestion
would
be
one
way
for
the
court
to
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
lawsuit
which
we
define
as
the
meaning
of
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
our
concern
in
the
case
is
that
the
court
ultimately
resolved
the
meaning
of
section
10
as
it
applies
in
this
situation.
we
just
simply
don't
know
how
to
operate
the
state
water
project
without
some
determination
by
the
--
by
this
court.
we
have
got
a
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit
which
is
adverse
and
presumably,
any
district
court
would
follow
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
any
future
litigation.
certainly,
we
would
expect
the
united
states
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
the
state
of
california
if
the
state
does
not
apply
for
the
permit
which
united
states
feels
to
be
necessary.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no.
there
has
been
no
application
for
a
permit
for
the
peripheral
canal.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
it
is
operating.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
pumping
plant
was
required
to
--
that
the
state
was
required
to
obtain
a
permit
for
the
pumping
plant,
but
it
stayed
its
injunction
with
respect
to
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
so
the
injunction
and
the
fact
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
part
of
that
is
that
we
believe
that
no
application
is
necessary
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
argued.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
correct.
the
difference,
i
believe
though
is
that
the
pumping
plants
are
currently
in
operation
and
we
want
to
do
everything
we
can
to
keep
them
going.
the
peripheral
canal
has
not
yet
been
built.
and
indeed,
there
is
a
local
california
referendum
that
will
decide
the
fate
of
the
canal.
it
will
be
acted
upon
by
the
california
electorate
within
the
next
18
months.
so
it
is
not
as
immediate.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
one
way
to
proceed,
but
if
we're
not
required
to
obtain
a
permit,
then
obviously,
perhaps
we
should
not.
so
there
we
are
again.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
have
made
no
allegation
that
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
and
i
--
i
don't
see
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right,
but
i
also
believe
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy.
i
don't
--
perhaps
i'm
not
following
you,
justice
white.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
correct.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
you'll
have
to
really
ask
the
sierra
club,
the
petition
--
the
respondents
more
what
their
interest
is,
but
i
think
their
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
okay.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
approach
which
we're
suggesting
to
this
court,
again,
i
emphasize,
focuses
on
the
existence
of
federal
navigation
interests
and
concerns.
this
approach
is
intended
to
preserve
the
traditional
institutional
roles
that
have
been
carried
out
by
the
corps
of
engineers
in
the
western
states
with
respect
to
the
control
and
management
of
the
water
resources
in
the
west.
the
corps
of
engineers
has
traditionally
focused
on
navigation
and
has
traditionally
been
concerned
with
navigation,
but
not
with
water
allocation.
by
the
same
token,
the
states
have
traditionally
focused
on
water
allocation,
and
under
the
congressional
delegation
of
authority
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
have
traditionally
been
responsible
for
allocating
water
among
competing
needs
in
the
west.
therefore,
the
corps
has
no
particular
expertise
over
this
subject
matter.
states,
on
the
other
had,
have
a
lot
of
expertise
on
this
subject.
but
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
would
effectively
allow
the
corps
to
essentially
usurp
this
historic
rule
occupied
by
the
states
and
begin
to
take
over
this
role
for
the
corps
of
engineers
itself.
it
would
allow
the
corps,
essentially,
to
occupy
a
role
that
has
been
historically
occupied
by
the
western
states.
so,
our
approach
is
designed
to
achieve
some
kind
of
accommodation
or
balance
between
federal
and
state
interests;
federal
navigation
interest
and
state
reclamation
interest.
on
the
one
hand,
our
approach
would
prevent
the
states
from
impairing
federal
navigation
interest
and
therefore
would
protect
the
federal
concerns
that
underly
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
but
on
the
other
hand,
our
approach
would
authorize
the
states
to
reclaim
their
arid
lands
in
situations
where
there
are
no
impacts
upon
federal
navigation
interest.
so
in
essence,
we
are
urging
that
this
court
seek
some
kind
of
accommodation
or
a
balance
between
federal
and
state
interest.
i
--
i
emphasize
once
again
very
strongly
that
this
court
has,
in
effect,
followed
and
adapted
the
very
approach
which
we
are
urging.
in
1899,
in
the
rio
grande
case,
this
court
appeared
to
adopt
a
rule
of
reason
test
in
defining
the
meaning
of
section
10,
and
its
definition
of
that
test
is
essentially
the
same
that
we
are
offering
to
this
court
today.
in
the
sanitary
district
and
wisconsin
cases,
the
court
held
that
section
10
was
applicable
to
water
diversions
from
lake
michigan
that
reduced
shipping
capacity
in
the
great
lakes
region
by
about
three
million
tons
each
year,
and
thus
had
a
substantial
effect
on
the
rights
of
the
many
states
that
bordered
lake
michigan.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
well,
that's
correct.
so
the
court
obviously
had
to
reach
the
question
in
that
case
and
you're
suggesting
the
possibility
that
the
court
may
not
have
to
do
so
here.
but
nonetheless,
the
sanitary
district
case
stands
for
the
proposition
where
there
is
an
effect
on
federal
navigation
interest,
as
there
were
in
that
case
in
lake
michigan
then
section
10
surely
applies,
but
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
an
effect
in
this
case.
so
essentially,
we
are
arguing
that
the
court
should
accommodate
federal
and
state
interest
in
this
case
by
seeking
an
accommodation
or
balance
of
these
interests
in
the
fields
of
reclamation
and
navigation.
this
is
the
same
test
the
court
followed
in
the
rio
grande
case.
we
urge
that
it
be
followed
here
and
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
mr
chief
justice,
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
just
for
a
briefing,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
sierra
club
has
stated
that
assuming
that
the
corps
of
engineers
has
jurisdiction,
the
corps
should
be
allowed
to
deny
the
permit
on
any
non-navigational
grounds
such
as
on
any
solely
environmental
grounds.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
position,
although
very
consistent
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
expressed
by
the
united
states
in
its
own
brief.
for
page
31
of
the
united
states
brief,
blissful
sentence,
the
united
states
makes
the
following
statement.
we
assume,
moreover,
that
an
alteration
or
modification
must
be
of
a
type
with
the
potential
for
affecting
navigation
i.e.
“that
water
quality
alterations
would
not
be
covered
unless
they
are
of
a
type
with
the
potential
for
reducing
stream
capacity,
for
example,
by
increasing
saltation.”
thus,
the
position
of
the
sierra
club
and
the
united
states
on
the
merits
of
this
case
is
apparently
at
odds
according
to
their
oral
arguments.
i
further
point
out
that
according
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
yes
indeed,
there
are
some
effects
in
this
case
caused
by
the
water
exports
upon
delta
environmental
quality.
those
effects
largely
related
to
salinity
intrusion
just
as
it
has
been
pointed
out.
the
state
water
resources
control
board,
in
the
process
of
issuing
appropriate
water
right
permits
to
the
state
water
project,
has
essentially
dealt
with
those
kind
of
concerns
and
has
worked
out
a
finally
tuned
program
to
ameliorate
or
perhaps
avoid
those
salinity
intrusion
problems
altogether.
so,
the
state
has
performed
a
very
active
function
and
rule
in
the
process
of
trying
to
determine
the
allocation
of
water
between
northern
and
central
and
southern
california
needs.
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
state's
role
should
be
maintained
that
the
program
developed
by
the
state
water
resources
control
board
should
be
upheld
and
that
the
corps
of
engineers
should
not
have
a
power
to
overwrite
it
or
veto
it
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
discernable,
substantial
effect
upon
federal
navigation
interest.
and
those,
that
kind
of
an
effect
simply
doesn't
exist
here.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
has
no
navigational
effect
that
we're
aware
of
and
the
court
--
and
the
lower
courts
did
not
so
hold.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it's
possible.
i
suppose
it's
hypothetically
possible
that
such
an
effect
could
take
place,
but
if
so,
the
lower
court
would
have
to
consider
that
question
and
make
factual
findings
on
it.
the
lower
court
didn't
do
that
in
this
case
because
it
held
that
the
act
was
triggered
merely
by
the
fact
that
the
water
exports
in
this
case
have
solely
environmental
effects.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
if
according
to
the
lower
--
the
district
court's
findings,
the
pumping
plants
would
reduce
water
levels
in
the
delta,
in
the
interior
delta
channels
where
commerce
actually
takes
place
by
that
one
inch.
and
that
is
the
combined
export
of
water,
both
by
the
state
pumping
plant
and
by
the
federal
pumping
plant.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
correct,
yes.
but
the
district
court
also
held
that
in
the
area
near
the
pumping
plants,
where
there
is
no
commerce,
the
--
the
water
exports,
the
combined
exports
from
both
the
federal
and
the
state
projects
would
there
reduce
delta
water
levels
by
about
this
much
of
a
foot-and-a-half.
but
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
actual
commerce
or
navigation
that
takes
place
in
those
exterior
delta
channels
that
are
near
the
pumping
plants.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
in
the
real
world,
i
don't
think
it's
--
it's
possible
to
expect
that
ships
would
be
applying
the
tribute
--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
but
the
area
we're
talking
about,
justice
white,
are
channels
that
lead
away
from
the
mainstream
of
the
delta
down
to
the
pumping
plants.
and
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
logs
and
no
ships
and
nothing
else
that
--
that
plies
those
particular
water.
thank
you.
