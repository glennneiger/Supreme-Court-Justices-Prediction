ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
respondents
were
brought
into
this
case
as
defendants
as
counsel
for
california
has
indicated
with
respect
to
a
federal
pumping
plant
that
also
pumped
water
to
the
south
part
of
the
state.
because
that
pumping
plant
was
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
authorized
by
congress,
it's
out
of
the
case
up
here
and
the
court
has
not
granted
petition
to
challenge
with
that
holding.
the
corps
of
engineers
were
also
named
as
defendants
in
this
case,
although
no
relief
was
sought
directly
against
them.
the
federal
pumping
plant
officials
and
the
state
pumping
plant
officials
were
ordered
to
apply
for
permits
to
the
corps
and
the
corps
has
been
processing
the
state's
permits
both,
i
understand,
for
the
current
delta
pumping
plant
and
for
a
planned
expansion
of
that
pumping
plant.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
--
we
are
here
supporting
petitioners
on
one
issue
and
private
respondents
on
one
issue,
your
honor.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
there
was
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct.
then
you
should
affirm
it
on
the
merit.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct,
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
the
government
took
not
much
of
any
position
with
respect
to
the
delta
plant
in
the
--
in
the
lower
courts.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
but
it
didn't
take
a
con
--
well,
it
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
correct.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
certainly
never,
at
any
time,
took
a
position
that
the
state
is
exempt
from
the
act
or
that
state
water
allocation
systems
are
exempt
for
the
act
with
the
types
of
arguments
that
the
state
is
pressing
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
no,
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
and
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
could
have
brought
our
own
action.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
you
honor,
what
we
--
the
factual
situation
in
the
delta
is
that
there's
some
change
in
water
levels.
we
think
that
the
characterization
of
that
--
and
that
flow
reversals
--
we
think
the
characterization
of
that
physical
situation
by
the
state
is
being
something
very
de
minimis
and
beneath
notice
is
incorrect,
but
characterizations
by
the
private
respondents
--
respondents
that
they
are
egregious
which
were
obvious
to
everybody
we
think
is
also
incorrect.
we
think
that
they
are
--
it's
a
situation
there
which
when
finally
and
fully
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
corps
and
do
reflection,
they're
recognized
as
--
as
meeting
the
threshold
requirements
of
clause
3
and
requiring
a
permit,
and
that's
what
they
are
processing
at
the
present
time.
in
this
court,
therefore,
as
they
did
below,
the
present
--
the
federal
respondents
are
challenging
the
right
of
the
sierra
club
to
bring
this
suit,
and
there,
it's
saying
the
state
is
wrong
in
suggesting
that
there
is
some
sort
of
special
exemption
for
states
or
for
states
with
state
water
allocation
systems,
or
for
state
water
allocations
systems
that
don't
substantially
impair
navigation.
i
will
devote
the
first
part
of
my
presentation
with
private
right
of
action
issues
since
we
agreed
that
that's
the
threshold
issue
and
you
don't
reach
the
question
on
the
merits
if
you
agree
with
us
on
that
issue.
in
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
considering
the
question
whether
a
private
right
of
action
under
a
federal
statute
may
be
implied
from
the
terms
of
that
statute,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
critical
question
is
congressional
intent.
i
refer
the
cases
such
as
transamerica
mortgage
investors
association,
touche
ross,
cannon
against
university
of
chicago
and
the
amtrak
case.
this
court
has
indicated
in
those
same
decisions
that
there
are
various
critical
tight
categories
of
evidence
respecting
congressional
intent
critical
in
showing
a
--
an
absence
of
any
intent
to
create
a
specific
implied
remedy
under
the
act.
one
of
those
two
--
one
critical
factor
is
whether
the
statute
contains
within
itself
a
specific
remedy,
and
moreover
a
remedy
that
is
specifically
entrusted
to
the
federal
officers
to
enforce.
another
critical
factor
is
whether
it
appears
that
congress
enacted
the
statute
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large
or
whether
it
enacted
the
statute
for
the
benefit
of
a
special
class.
we
submit
that,
with
respect
for
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
both
of
those
factors
are
present
and
if
they
indicate
that
there
was
no
intent
on
the
private
part
of
congress
to
include
and
imply
private
remedy
to
enforce
the
statute.
in
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
congress
has
devised
a
scheme
entrusting
to
an
expert
federal
administrative
body
the
task
of
determining
whether
certain
types
of
obstructions
to
navigable
capacity
are
unreasonable
types
of
obstructions
and
therefore,
it
should
not
be
permitted.
that
body
of
experts
is
the
secretary
of
war,
later
the
secretary
of
army,
and
chief
of
engineers,
and
the
corps
of
engineers.
if
it
appears
that
someone
is
in
violation
of
the
act
and
efforts
by
the
corps
is
secured
of
compliance
or
unavailing,
the
corps
can
go
to
the
us
attorney,
to
the
justice
department,
and
suggest
to
them
that
the
action
in
court
is
advisable.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
how
long
it
went
on.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it
did
appear.
it
didn't
appear
over
night.
a
decade
ago,
i
think
it
might
have
been
gradual.
and
we
don't
assert
--
we
assert
that
the
court
is
expert.
we
don't
assert
that
it's
infallible
but
we
think
that
congress
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
only
when
speaking
on
matters
of
navigability.
if
it
appears
that
someone
is
in
violation
then,
if
the
corps
thinks
that
court
action
is
necessary,
it
may
ask
the
us
attorney
to
seek
appropriate
relief
and
these
may
be
criminal
penalties,
it
also
maybe
injunctive
relief.
and
section
406
of
the
act,
which
is
the
enforcement
provision
for
section
10,
specifically
provides
for
both.
i
might
quote
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that,
of
course,
section
406,
where
it
says
that
courts
will
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
removal
of
structures
in
the
waters
found
illegal
under
section
9
or
10,
this
court
in
republic
steel
has
construed
that
as
much
broader.
that
is
that
the
u.s.
attorney,
when
he
is
--
when
he
is
seeking
remedies
against
violations
of
the
act
if
it
not
in
fact
limited
to
the
literal
language
of
that
--
of
that
sentence.
and
in
making
that
judgment,
the
court
emphasized
that
the
reason
he
is
not
limited
to
that
is
because
congress
in
this
statute
was
securing
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
in
section
17
of
the
act
they
said,
“the
department
of
justice
shall
conduct
these
proceedings
to
enforce
--
all
necessary
proceedings
to
enforce
the
provisions.”
and
there
was
a
very
strong
strain
in
republic
steel
case
emphasizing
that
we
have
to
have
a
broad
remedy
here
because
this
is
the
interest
of
the
united
states
that
are
being
enforced
with
and
that
powers
of
attorney
general
are
brought
to
bear
in
these
proceedings.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
read
from
that
case.
i
sense
that
the
broad
types
of
equitable
relief
which
might
be
sought
by
private
parties
are
contained
in
the
act
because
congress
wanted
private
parties
to
have
those
powers.
second,
now,
some
of
the
courts
in
the
sierra
club
say,
well,
section
17
only
concerns
criminal
proceedings.
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
is
the
one
to
bring
these
criminal
proceedings.
but
this
means
that
the
phrase,
all
proceedings
necessary
to
enforce
the
act
doesn't
include
injunctive
relief
and
that
--
that
just
can't
be
true
because
injunctive
relief
is
obviously
quite
critical
to
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
and
section
17
says
the
department
of
justice
shall
control
those
proceedings.
language
expressly
assigning
enforcement
of
statute
to
federal
officers,
of
course,
is
not
absolutely
preclusive
of
the
private
right
of
action,
although,
extremely
strong
evidence.
but
here,
as
we
have
noted,
it
is
strengthened
by
the
second
consideration
that
this
statute
was
enacted
to
protect
the
right
of
the
public,
the
public
at
large,
and
it
was
not
enacted
for
special
class
as
this
court
has
found
in
other
statute,
such
as
the
voting
rights
act
in
the
allen
case.
and
in
fact,
in
the
cannon
decision,
in
footnote
13
of
the
cannon
decision,
the
court
specifically
describes
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
as
a
statute
enacted
to
create
a
--
to
protect
the
rights
of
publics
at
large.
now,
the
sierra
club
has
argued
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
authorize
suits
under
section
10
of
the
act
by
private
parties
suffering
special
damages,
because
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
the
principle
that
person
suffering
a
private
nuisance
may
sometimes
enjoin
to
--
enjoin
the
public
nuisance
where
they
have
special
damages.
they
have
also
suggested
that
congress
must
have
contemplated
such
private
enforcement
of
the
act
because
it
was
concerned
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
willamette
bridge
case
and
a
case
was
brought
by
private
parties
and
dismissed
because
there
was
no
federal
law
for
them
to
bring
the
case
on
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
the
corp
of
engineers
requests
the
department
of
justice
to
bring
with
receipt
as
their
--
their
lawyers
may
suit
their
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
i
believe
that
justice
could.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case,
it
says
in
section
17,
the
department
of
justice
shall
control
all
proceedings
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
this
act.
so
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
less
to
the
question
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes
i
would
think
so.
i
--
there's
not
a
sense
to
second-guess
policy
decisions
of
agencies,
certainly,
the
justice
department.
the
sierra
club
also
relies,
as
i
say,
on
the
willamette
case.
these
arguments
might
have
some
force
if
congress
had
written
the
statute
different
from
the
one
that
they
wrote.
but
they
didn't
write
a
statute
simply
saying,
“thus
and
such
a
structure
shall
be
a
nuisance
or
the
--
or
unconsidered
structure
shall
be
unlawful.”
they
wrote
this
statute
that
creates
a
system
of
review.
and
i
think,
to
emphasize
the
problems
or
to
illustrate
the
problems
with
the
sierra
club's
argument,
we
might
profitably
look
at
the
willamette
bridge
case
itself.
that
case
involved
plans
to
construct
a
bridge
over
the
willamette
river
which
the
decision
says
with
the
river,
the
navigable
portion
indicates
the
navigable
portions
of
that
river
were
entirely
within
the
state
of
oregon.
that
would
mean
that
the
construction
of
that
bridge
would
come
within
section
9
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
and
it
would
not
need
the
consent
of
the
congress
because
the
navigable
portions
of
the
river
are
entirely
in
the
state.
all
would
it
need
would
be
that
the
plan
should
be
approved
by
the
chief
of
engineers.
after
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
were
passed,
if
the
statute
is
construed
as
we
say
it
should
be
construed,
what
senator
dolph's
client,
mr.
hatch
and
his
co-plaintiffs
would
have
done,
is
go
to
the
local
corps
of
engineers
and
say,
“these
people
are
planning
to
build
this
bridge
over
the
willamette
river
and
they
haven't
gotten
their
plans
approved
by
you.”
and
the
corps
could
go
to
the
bridge
builders
and
say,
“you
can't
build
that
bridge
unless
you
show
us
your
plans
and
--
and
when
we
approved
them.”
if
there
was
refusal
and
noncompliance,
the
corps
of
engineers
could
go
to
the
department
of
justice
and
say,
“join
the
building
of
that
bridge
because
they're
going
to
build
it
on
in
proper
plans.”
however,
if
the
corps
of
engineers
looked
at
the
plans
and
said,
“those
plans
look
fine
to
us,
go
ahead
and
build
your
bridge,”
even
if
senator
dolph's
clients,
mr.
hatch
and
his
co-plaintiffs
didn't
like
it
and
thought
the
bridge
would
still
be
inconvenient
to
them,
they
would
have
no
rights
under
this
act
to
say
that
bridge
is
lose,
don't
build
it,”
because
this
act
doesn't
--
doesn't
protect
the
individual's
convenience.
it
protects
the
rights
of
the
public.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
you
mean
the
decision
of
the
court?
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
think
the
situation
now
with
the
administrative
procedure
act,
that
it
probably
would
be
reviewable.
but
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
1899
act,
its
pass
have
probably
wasn't.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
probably
now,
yes.
but
if
you're
talking
about
the
intent
of
congress
in
1899
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
its
agency
action,
i
suspect,
it
would.
although,
it's
discretionary
and
there's
a
question
of
whether
what
standard
it
would
be.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
if
he
really
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
--
if
he
really
wants
damages,
he
can
sue
in
a
state
court.
we're
talking
about
federal
court
actions
here.
why
does
he
have
to
sue
under
the
statute
if
there's
a
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
i
think
it
does.
we
think
this
act
is
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
think
this
act
creates
no
private
right
of
action.
i
might
say
on
that
that
it's
--
it's
evident
to
us
that
it's
very
complicated
trying
to
fit
these
very
different
types
of
private
--
private
right
of
actions.
this
--
the
private
actions
of
the
sierra
club
is
relying
on
to
dovetail
them
with
the
statute.
and
for
this
reason,
congress
not
having
said
anything
on
this
subject
as
to
how
this
were
to
--
how
this
were
to
fit,
we
can't
say
that
--
that
they
really
had
any
intent
of
their
being
private
actions
here.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
question
of
this
rivers
and
harbors
act
in
the
state
court.
i
thought
they'd
have
a
common
law
in
nuisance
action
of
the
state
court,
not
an
action
under
this
statute.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
that's
right,
but
they
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
that's
right.
but
if
they
have
any
remedies
under
state
law
or
traditional
nuisance
actions,
they
could
go
to
the
state
courts
for
that.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
it's
not
--
we're
not
saying
it's
preemptive
of
state
nuisance
actions.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
the
state
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
if
--
if
the
question
of
whether
a
private
remedy
is
included
in
--
in
a
federal
statute,
it's
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
we
think
that
there
was
no
intent
to
create
a
private
remedy
in
the
statute
that
this
was
a
statute
to
be
enforced
by
the
department
of
justice
as
the
--
as
the
congress
said
in
section
17.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
certainly,
if
they
wanted
to
say
that
as
a
matter
state
law.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be.
it's
not
preemptive
in
that
sense.
i
--
i
might
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
we
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
we
think
it
did
change
the
remedial
setup
because
of
the
way
the
statute
was
instructed
--
yes.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
and
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
senator
vest's
comments,
he
thought
really
what
you
needed
was
federal
enforcement
here
that
that's
what
would
take
care
of
the
situation.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
he
did
not
specifically
say
there
can
be
nothing
else,
but
there
certainly
no
--
no
statement
by
anyone
that
were
here
by
creating
a
private
right
of
action.
i'd
like
to
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
we
don't
think
there
was
any
federal
cause
of
action
before
this
and
this
statute.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
in
either
--
neither
one
did
--
did
create
one.
i'd
like
to
just
touch
briefly
on
our
arguments
against
the
state's
claims
that
it's
exempted
from
this
act.
i
won't
address
their
claim
that
they
make
in
their
brief
that
states
don't
even
come
under
the
act
at
all
because
i
--
we
can't
believe
they're
seriously
oppressing
that
claim.
i
would
like
to
address
its
contention
that
state
water
allocation
systems
are
somehow
exempt
from
the
act.
and
simply
to
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
act,
it
very
clearly
covers
any
disturbance
of
navigability
or
any
alteration
in
condition,
and
clause
3
has
to
be
looked
at
by
the
court.
it
says
nothing
about
unless
it's
part
of
a
state
water
allocation
system.
i
might
say
also
that
that's
an
extremely
amorphous
category
in
state
water
allocation
systems.
i
think
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
your
honor,
i
can't
see
any
conflict
in
here
because
in
--
in
section
8
of
the
1902
act,
they
said
they
preserved
the
existing
state
authority
to
control
their
water
acts.
well,
existing
state
authority
was
qualified
by
the
requirements
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
but,
your
honor,
as
i
read
your
opinion
in
california
versus
united
states,
you
say
that
where
a
state
law
is
inconsistent
with
congressional
objectives
--
directives
that
it
doesn't
prevail.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
and
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
well,
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
--
that
if
--
again,
as
i
read
california
against
united
states,
it
says
if
there's
a
congressional
directive
that's
inconsistent
with
the
state
law,
it
prevails.
and
here,
we
have
a
congressional
directive
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
it
says,
“if
you
alter
the
conditions
of
navigable
waters,”
we
agree
there's
a
de
minimis
standard
there
by
the
way.
and
if
you
--
if
it
has
the
potential,
we
believe
that's
what
clause
3
really
--
really
means.
these
are
things
that
might
have
the
potential
for
a
disturbing
navigability
and
there's
something
that
the
court
should
take
a
look
at
and
decide
whether
they
should
be
permitted
or
not.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
read
that
clause
out
and
don't
let
the
government
look
at
us
until
there's
a
fait
accompli.
now,
that's
not
the
scheme
of
the
statute.
the
statute
is
let
the
court
look
at
it
and
decide
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
serious
disturbance
of
navigability
and
if
there
is,
they
won't
permit
it.
if
there
is
not,
they
--
they
will
allow
it.
i
will
agree
that
in
their
permitting
process
now,
as
it's
changed
recently,
they
look
at
things
beyond
that.
there
--
they
now
look
at
environmental
factors
because
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
coordination
act
in
other
words.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes.
i
do
not
agree
though.
we
do
not
accept
the
suggestions
by
california.
the
court
decides
this
person
should
have
water
and
that
person
shouldn't
have
water,
stockton
should
have
water
and
california
shouldn't.
they
look
always
to
the
effects
on
the
water
--
the
effects
on
water.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
yes,
although,
strictly
--
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
strictly
speaking
--
strictly
speaking,
i
think
that
question
is
not
here
on
review.
disabled
--
that
really
disabled
the
tab
issue
and
what's
--
what
the
state
is
claiming
that
they
don't
even
come
under
clause
3
as
it
was
--
as
it
was
enacted
in
1899.
and
--
and
that
--
that
clearly
is
wrong
whether
--
whether
the
fifth
circuit
is
right
as
we
think
it
was
and
they
will
be
a
tabbed
if
the
court
can
look
at
this
other
--
other
fact
--
environmental
factors.
i
think
it's
not
--
it's
not
here
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
ms.
elinor
hadley
stillman
thank
you.
