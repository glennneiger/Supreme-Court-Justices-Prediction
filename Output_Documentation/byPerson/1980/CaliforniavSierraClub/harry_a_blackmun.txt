justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
if
somebody
knows
more
with
--
with
the
diversion
without
a
permit,
the
only
thing
that
--
the
only
thing
the
court
can
do
about
it
is
to
ask
the
justice
to
bring
the
suit.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
the
justice
department
says,
“sorry
no
permit
is
required,”
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
it
make
it
--
would
it
make
that
decision
reviewable
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
is
today?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
not.
i'm
talking
about
the
(voice
overlap)
decision
like
that
would
be
reviewable
there
or
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
historical
argument
--
let
me
just
--
(inaudible)
then
the
historical
argument
is
that
there
had
been
private
action
to
try
and
prevent
bridges
and
(inaudible)
and
then
that
this
was
--
this
statute
was
enacted
to
make
something
unlawful
that
the
court
did
not
rule
in
the
holding
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
but
not
to
change
the
remedial
setup
at
all.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
the
way
of
remedy
that
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
he
say
go
ahead
and
--
sure
he
wanted
it
but
there
could
be
nothing
else
too?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
think
that
kind
of
a
--
excuse
me.
were
you
saying
that
that
kind
of
a
case
would
technically
arise
under
a
federal
statute
and
give
a
federal
district
court
jurisdiction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
all
that
you're
saying,
it's
a
cause
of
action
for
nuisance.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
only
--
have
the
--
you
--
you
aren't
saying
--
i
guess
what
you're
arguing
is
that
this
isn't
a
--
that's
kind
of
a
case
that
wouldn't
be
a
private
cause
of
action
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
at
all
--
federal
jurisdiction
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
they
--
what
if
they
brought
it
at
the
state
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
would
it
--
would
it
be
controlled
by
federal
law
or
state
law
as
to
what
a
nuisance
is?
