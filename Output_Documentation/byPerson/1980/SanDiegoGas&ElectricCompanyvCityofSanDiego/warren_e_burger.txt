mr.

you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
but
if,
when
this
case
goes
back,
if
it
goes
back,
the
trial
court
can
find
that
you
can
build
whatever
you
could
have
built
initially,
before
the
zoning
change,
haven't
you
got
all
the
relief
that
you
are
entitled
to?
chief
justice
burger
the
interim
damages
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
entirely
used
up,
counsel.
mr.
sumption.
chief
justice
burger
at
some
point
will
you
tell
us
what
is
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
trial
court,
assuming
this
case
went
back?
what
can
it
do?
do
it
in
your
own
time,
but
tell
us
about
it
sometime.
chief
justice
burger
we'll
bring
it
up
again.
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
the
definition
of
open
space,
isn't
that
a
public--
chief
justice
burger
--what's
the
difference
if
they
declared
it
a
park
and
put
a
lot
of
park
benches
in
it
and
let
the
public
use
it?
chief
justice
burger
but
are
you
telling
us
now
that
the
public
is
not
using
it
by--
chief
justice
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
they
can
do--
--does
the
complaint
even
mention
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
burger
i
don't
think
it
does.
chief
justice
burger
no,
can
get
whatever
relief
it
could
have
gotten
initially?
chief
justice
burger
broad.
can
they
get
whatever
they
could
get
in
the
beginning?
have
any
of
these
interim
decisions
foreclosed
them
of
any
right
they
had
in
1973?
chief
justice
burger
you
say
that's
police
power,
not
fifth
amendment
taking?

justice

you,
