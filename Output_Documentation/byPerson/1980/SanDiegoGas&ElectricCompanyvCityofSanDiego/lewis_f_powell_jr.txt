justice
jr.
you
commenced
your
brief,
as
i
recall,
by
saying
that
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
trial
court
had
been
rejected.
where
in
any
opinion
is
that
made
clear?
justice
jr.
mr.
sumption,
let's
come
back
to
the
facts
that
were
found
by
the
trial
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal,
one
of
which
was
that
it
would
be
perfectly
futile
to
do
what
you
call
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
now,
was
there
ever
any
finding
by
an
appellate
court
anywhere
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
that
finding
by
the
trial
court?
justice
jr.
well,
aren't
you
relying
on
an
inference
when
there
were
originally
two
findings,
or
rather
finding
by
the
trial
court
and
acceptance
of
that
finding
by
the
california
intermediate
appellate
court,
that
it
would
have
been
futile?
the
california
supreme
court
didn't
say
anything
to
the
contrary.
justice
jr.
are
you
saying
that
all
findings
have
been
vacated
in
this
case?
justice
jr.
could
you
identify
by
number
the
findings
that
have
been
vacated?
justice
jr.
everything
relevant
to
this
case
has
been
vacated,
is
that
your
position?
justice
jr.
the
only
basis
for
your
argument,
i
judge
from
what
you
have
said,
is
the
final
paragraph
in
the
four-page
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
on
its
second
consideration
of
this
case?
justice
jr.
there's
nothing
in
that
paragraph
as
i
read
it
that
rejects
finding
no.
29,
which
in
substance
says
that
the
owner
already
has
been
deprived
of
all
practical
use
of
his
property.
what
language
in
that
paragraph
states?
justice
jr.
what
i
don't
understand
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
decision
in
agins
didn't
deal
at
all
with
these
factual
findings.
did...
and
i
say
this
from
principles
of
law,
that
it
would
appear
caused
it
to
remand
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeal.
there
was
no
rejection
by
the
california
supreme
court
of
the
findings,
and
no
review,
again,
of
findings
by
your
intermediate
appellate
court.
if
there's
any
authority
in
your
brief
that
says
that
all
facts
are
wiped
out
in
those
circumstances,
that
may
be
another
thing.
we
took
the
case
because
we
thought
it
was
different
from
agins.
justice
jr.
but
you
are
now
arguing
that
inferentially
this
is
entirely
a
new
ball
game?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
another
question
before
you
take
up
another
point?
if
we
should
conclude
that
findings
29
and
32
are
still
before
us,
would
you
agree
that
there
has
been
a
taking?
justice
jr.
would
you
develop
that
a
little
bit?
one
finding
states
that
no
practical
use
can
be
made
of
the
property.
the
other
states
that
it
would
be
futile
to
make
any
application
for
further
administrative
relief.
at
that
point
you
have
a
property
owner
with
property
that
is
apparently
worthless.
why
hasn't
there
been
a
taking?
justice
jr.
mr.
sumption,
let
me
put
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
somewhat
differently.
suppose
you
owned,
say,
50
acres
of
quite
scenic
property
and
the
city
had
simply
adopted
an
ordinance
saying
that,
we
would
zone
that
property
as
a
natural
habitat
for
animals
and
fauna
and
the
flora;
never
put
anything
on
it,
we're
just
going
to
zone
it
for
that
purpose.
but
the
public
may
wander
through
it,
may
fish
in
the
ponds,
may
make
such
use
as
it
wishes.
are
you
saying
there
would
be
no
taking?
