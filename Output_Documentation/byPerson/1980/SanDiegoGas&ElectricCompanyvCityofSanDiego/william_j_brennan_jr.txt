justice
jr.
well,
am
i
wrong
that
the
latest
order
of
the
intermediate
appellate
court
leaves
open
the
question
whether
there
was
a
taking?
justice
jr.
initially,
there
was
a
finding,
you
know,
that
there
was
a
taking,
both
by
the
initial
court
and
by
the
appellate
division,
was
there
not?
justice
jr.
but
then
i
thought,
when...
what's
this
strange
practice
of
a
transfer
by
your
supreme
court
to
the
appellate
court?
that's
not
a
remand,
or
is
it?
justice
jr.
well,
does
it
vacate
the
judgment
clause?
did
the
transfer
vacate
the
affirmance
of
the
finding
of
taking?
justice
jr.
well,
and
then,
doesn't
the
appellate
court
send
it
back
leaving
still
open
the
question
of
taking?
justice
jr.
see,
what
i'm
reaching
at,
is
there
a
final
judgment
here?
that's...
do
we
have
jurisdiction
at
all?
justice
jr.
on
the
taking
question?
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
goebel,
what's
the
significance
of
that
sentence
in
the
second
opinion
of
the
appellate
court,
"the
city
has
not
made
application
to
use
or
improve
the
property,
nor
has
it
asked
the
city
what
development
might
be
permitted.
"
what's
that
all
about?
justice
jr.
it
sounds
like
you
didn't
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies.
justice
jr.
well,
why
does
the
court
of
appeal
throw
this
in
in
the
second
opinion?
justice
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
goebel,
could
the
city,
i
take
it,
repeal
this
ordinance?
it
could
now,
couldn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
suppose
it
repealed
it.
then
i
take
it
you'd
be
free
or
your
client
would
be
free
to
go
ahead
and
build
its
nuclear
power
with
no
inhibition
in
this
ordinance.
now,
if
that
were
to
happen,
would
the
holding
as
to
compensation
mean
you
could
not
have
compensation
for
the
period
that
you've
been
denied
the
use
of
the
property
to
build
a
nuclear
plant,
whatever
that
period
is,
a
year
or
two,
something?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
are
you
entitled
to
the
interim
damages
as
the
consequence
of
a
taking,
or
just
of
deprivation
of
use
for
the
seven
or
eight
years?
justice
jr.
it's
not
consequent
upon
a
taking
if
the
ordinance
that
caused
all
the
trouble,
the
difficulty
for
you.
if
that's
invalidated,
then
there's
no
taking,
is
there?
you'll
be
free
to
go
ahead
and
erect
your
nuclear
plant.
justice
jr.
you
may
have
a
claim
for
damages
in
ten
or
fifteen
years.
justice
jr.
i
thought
a
taking
usually
meant,
as
my
brother
stewart
suggested
earlier,
the
government,
whatever
the
unit
may
be,
ends
up
with
the
property
and
you
end
up
with
money.
right.
and
if
the
government
doesn't
end
up
with
the
property,
because
the
ordinance
is
invalidated,
then
you
keep
the
property.
you
can
build
your
plant,
and
if
you
have
any
claim,
why
is
it
anything
more
than
damages?
justice
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
goebel,
your
client's
no
longer
interested
in
building
the
plant;
let
the
city
keep
the
property;
it
wants
the
money.
justice
jr.
well,
can't
the
city
back
out
if
it
wants
to?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
can't
it?
justice
jr.
it
would
be
compelled
to,
i
take
it,
if
the
courts
were
to
invalidate
this
synergistic
combination
that
you
have.
justice
jr.
--are
you
saying
that
any
members
of
the
public
who
came
on
this
land
after
it
had
been
declared
open
land
would
have
been
trespassers?
justice
jr.
against
whom
the
electric
company
should
proceed?
justice
jr.
now,
is
transfer
a
peculiar
procedure
in
california?
justice
jr.
same
thing?
justice
jr.
was
that
the
sentence
quoted
earlier?
justice
jr.
and
what
then
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeal
required
the
superior
court
now
to
do?
justice
jr.
retry
the
taking
issue?
justice
jr.
well,
wouldn't
you
have
a
reason
to
disavow
the
finding
that
an
effort
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
would
be
futile?
you
have
to
rely
on
that
one
sentence
in
which
they
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
actually
the
property
owner
never
did
apply
for
any
administrative
relief.
justice
jr.
but
surely,
earlier
they
said,
didn't
have
to
because
it'd
be
futile
to
do
it.
justice
jr.
but
you
have
to...
you
really
have
to
build
everything
on
that
one
sentence,
don't
you?
