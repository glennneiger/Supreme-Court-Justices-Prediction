justice
stevens
mr.
goebel,
your
client,
as
i
understand
it,
wants
to
build
a
power
plant
on
this
land.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
the
taking,
the
theory
of
the
taking,
is
that
you're
denied
the
right
to
build
the
plant
you
planned
on
building?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing,
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
enters
an
order
that
says,
let
them
build
either
a
power
plant
or
some
other
industrial
use.
would
you
be
complaining
about
that?
justice
stevens
what
do
you
want
to
use
the
land
for?
justice
stevens
give
me
an
example
of
what
you'd
like
to
use
the
land
for?
justice
stevens
all
right.
supposing,
when
you
go
back,
the
trial
judge
enters
an
order
and
says
that
this
would
be
an
unconstitutional
taking
unless
the
property
owner
is
permitted
to
build
precisely
that,
and
you
will
argue
for
the
right
to
do
that?
you
do
have
the
right
to
do
that
on
remand,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
you
get
any
relief
at
all
on
remand?
justice
stevens
would
you
have
an
opportunity
on
remand
to
ask
the
judge
to
say,
please
enter
an
order
that
will
allow
us
to
develop
this
as
an
industrial
park?
justice
stevens
i
know
it's
not
the
practice,
but
you've
claimed
your
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
you.
and
in
order
to
remedy
the
constitutional
rights,
you
say
the
only
thing
that
will
protect
us
is
to
let
us
build
this
industrial
park.
would
he
have
power
to
grant
you
that
relief?
justice
stevens
how
do
we
know
he's
not
going
to
do
it?
justice
stevens
now,
if
they
grant
that
relief,
how
could
there
then
have
been
a
taking?
aren't
the
things
that
are
set
aside
the
things
on
which
you
rely
to
establish
the
taking?
justice
stevens
you're
making
sort
of
a
law
of
the
case,
are
you?
justice
stevens
let
me
put
it
more
simply.
if
you
get
the
relief
you
prayed
for
in
paragraph
3
of
your
complaint,
would
you
still
contend
there
had
been
a
taking?
justice
stevens
of
what?
you
have
a
total
right
to
use
your
property
any
way
you
want
to.
justice
stevens
well,
you
might
have
a
damage
action
for
the
loss
of
the
use
of
the
property
in
the
seven
years,
but
you
have
not
alleged
any
intent
to
use
the
property
in
this
period
of
time.
all
you
describe
here
is
some
long-range
plan
in
the
future
that
you
say
was
denied
you.
maybe
you
could
amend
your
complaint
to
get
damages,
but
i
don't
understand
how
there's
a
taking
if
you
set
aside
that
which
constituted
the
taking?
justice
stevens
right.
mr.
goebel,
it's
of
course
perfectly
clear
that
if
a
sovereign
takes
and
keeps
property,
he's
got
to
pay
for
it.
justice
stevens
if
he
takes
it
rightfully.
but
is
there
any
precedent
at
all
that
you've
cited
where
the
government
has
impaired
the
use
of
private
property
in
attempting
to
serve
some
governmental
purpose,
and
its
action
has
later
been
held
unconstitutional,
and
it's
been
required
to
pay
money
to
the
property
owner?
justice
stevens
owen
isn't
such
a
case.
owen
is
an
individual
discharge.
justice
stevens
but
this
court
has
never
held
there's
any
such
obligation?
justice
stevens
no,
no,
those
are
all
rightful...
those
are
all
cases
where
it's
held
that
the
sovereign
had
the
power
to
do
what
it
sought
to
do.
now,
you
rely
on
a
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out...
theory.
is
there
any
case
where
the
government
has
acted
wrongfully
and
the
consequence
of
its
wrong
has
been
to
impair
the
use
of
property
and
the
government's
had
to
pay
the
property
owner
money
for
its
wrong?
justice
stevens
well,
the
fifth
amendment
deals
with
rightful
taking,
for
the
moment.
if
this...
have
you
got
any
case
at
all
for
your
position,
involving
a
wrongful
interference
with
the
use
of
property,
where
the
government
was
required
to
pay
the
property
owner
even
a
dime?
justice
stevens
no,
in
causby
it
was
held
that
the
government
was
within
its
rights
in
flying
the
airplanes
over
the
property,
and
that
what
it
did
was
rightful
but
it
caused
harm,
and
therefore
was
a
taking
and
it
had
to
pay
for
it.
justice
stevens
well,
in
the
second
and
third
counts
of
your
complaint
you
do,
you
allege...
in
your
petition
for
mandate
you
allege
it
was
wrongful.
justice
stevens
you
have
an
action
for
rent.
