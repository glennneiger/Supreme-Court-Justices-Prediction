justice
rehnquist
isn't
agins
itself
a
precedent?
it
says
you
don't
collect
damages,
you
seek
a
writ
of
mandate.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
goebel,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
about
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
f14
in
the
blue
brief,
where
it
says,
"recognizing
that
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
is
here
involved,
we
also
accept
the
reasonable
latitude
which
must
be
afforded
public
officials
on
planning
for
implementation
of
legitimate
land
use
goals.
"
"these
twin
purposes
will
be
served
by
preserving
to
the
landowner
in
appropriate
cases
declaratory
relief
or
mandamus
remedies.
"
"however,
the
use
of
inverse
condemnation
with
its
imposition
of
money
damages
upon
the
public
entity
would
in
our
view
unwisely
inhibit
the
proper
and
necessary
exercise
of
a
valid
police
power.
"
now,
do
you
read
that
to
say
that
money
damages
are
simply
not
recoverable
regardless
of
how
arbitrary
the
zoning
of
the
city
was?
justice
rehnquist
does
the
plan
forbid
the
owner
to
make
anything
of
an
open
space
without
the
approval
of
the
municipal
plan?
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
certainly
not
a
factual
question
to
say
that
if
the
city
says
that
the
214
acres
of
the
san
diego
power
company
land
that's
presently
open
is
hereafter
a
park
with
access
to
everybody,
and
no
compensation
is
to
be
paid.
justice
rehnquist
what
would
the
city
have
done
had
the
utility
attempted
to
develop
the
214
acres
in
a
way
you
would
normally
expect
a
utility
to
normally
develop
such
acreage?
justice
rehnquist
including
construction
of
a
nuclear
plant?
justice
rehnquist
but
not
the
superior
court
opinion?
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
ordinary
proceedings
vacated
the
intermediate
appellate
court
opinion,
but
left
standing,
reversed,
or
affirmed
the
superior
court
opinion?
justice
rehnquist
you
mean,
you
think
the
city
could
announce
that
as
of
january
1,
1973,
this
particular
215
acres
is
a
park
to
which
all
of
the
citizens
of
california
shall
have
access,
and
then
on
january
1,
1978,
five
years
later,
pay
the
company
the
fair
value
of
the
park?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
don't
you
have
to
disavow
part
of
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion?
justice
rehnquist
well,
because
the
court
of
appeal
had
no
hesitation
reaching
the
takings
question.
justice
rehnquist
but
the
california
court
of
appeal
has
not
held
that
there
was
no
taking.
it
says
that
remains
open
for
the
utility
if
it
desires
to
retry
the
case
and
produce
new
evidence,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
california
is
a
part
of
the
united
states,
isn't
it?
