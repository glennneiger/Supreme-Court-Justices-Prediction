justice
blackmun
let
me
be
a
little
more
specific.
when
did
your
client,
the
utility,
reach
the
decision
not
to
build
these
nuclear
plants?
justice
blackmun
do
you
know
what
the
basis
of
that
decision
was?
justice
blackmun
have
you
ever
tried
to
sell
any
of
the
property
in
question?
justice
blackmun
have
you
had
any
offers
to
purchase?
justice
blackmun
but,
in
any
event,
the
appellant
never
sought
approval
for
a
nuclear
plant?
justice
blackmun
and
yet
they
purported
to
bring
within
the
possibility
a
nuclear
power
plant.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeal
of
california,
the
san
diego
gas
and
the
electric
company,
a
public
utility
owns
his
land
in
the
city
of
san
diego.
this
land
lies
near
the
pacific
ocean
and
was
purchased
by
the
utility
in
1996
as
a
possible
cite
for
a
nuclear
power
plant
to
be
constructed
in
the
1980s.
at
that
time,
the
property
was
zoned
mostly
for
industrial
or
agricultural
use.
the
city,
however,
rezoned
parts
of
it
and
established
an
open
space
plan
that
included
this
property
and
proposed
that
the
city
acquire
to
preserve
it
for
parkland
purposes.
the
bond
issue
for
that
purpose
however
failed
and
the
property
has
remained
in
the
utility's
hand
subject
to
the
new
zoning
ordinance
and
the
open
space
plan.
the
utility
brought
an
action
in
california
state
court
alleging
that
the
city
had
taken
its
property
without
just
compensation.
it
sought
damages
for
what
it
called
the
inverse
condemnation
and
also
mandamus
and
declaratory
relief,
and
then
followed
complex
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
of
california,
culmination
in
a
remand
from
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
and
a
holding
by
the
intermediate
state
court
that
the
utility
could
not
recover
compensation
through
inverse
condemnation.
we
know
that
jurisdiction
in
the
case
to
consider
the
question
whether
a
state
must
provide
a
monetary
remedy
to
a
landowner
whose
property
allegedly
has
been
taken
by
a
regulatory
ordinance.
this
question
had
been
left
open
last
term
in
the
city
of
tiburon
case.
we
conclude
with
some
reluctance
that
again
we
lack
jurisdiction
in
this
case
and
must
leave
the
issue
undecided.
we
reach
this
conclusion
because
the
state
court
of
appeal
did
not
decide
whether
any
remedy
other
than
monetary
compensation
is
available
because
it
has
not
decided
whether
any
taking
in
fact
occurred.
further
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
are
remand
--
on
remand
are
contemplated
to
resolve
disputed
factual
issues.
there
is
such
no
final
judgment
as
it
is
required
under
a
federal
statute
28
u.s.c.
1257
for
review
by
this
court.
it
appealed
as
therefore
dismissed.
mr.
justice
rhenquist,
while
joining
the
opinion,
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
therein
by
justices
stewart
and
marshall,
and
powell.
