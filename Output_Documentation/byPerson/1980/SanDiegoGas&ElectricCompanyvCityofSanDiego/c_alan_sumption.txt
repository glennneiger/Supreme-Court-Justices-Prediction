mr.
c.
alan
sumption
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
briefly,
i'd
like
to
go
over
some
of
what
i
consider
to
be
the
important
relevant
facts
in
this
case,
because--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--all
right,
your
honor.
thank
you.
and
if
i
neglect
to
answer
your
question,
would
you
please
remind
me?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
think
the
facts
are
crucial
to
get
a
grasp
of
what
this
case
is
all
about,
because
we've
got
a
number
of
confusing
facts
and
a
number
of
shifting
and
conflicting
theories
of
liability
and
seeking
of
relief
against
the
city
of
san
diego.
we're
talking
about
land
use
regulation
by
way
of
zoning
on
approximately
half
of
the
214
acres
of
the
property
that
the
trial
court
said
we
had
taken.
we're
talking
about
land
use
activity
by
way
of
planning,
as
opposed
to
zoning,
by
the
adoption
of
an
open
space
plan,
mandated
by
the
state
of
california,
required
by
all
local
governments,
to
attempt
to
plan
for
the
preservation,
whether
it
be
through
regulation
or
acquisition,
of
open
space
lands
that
are
currently
being
diminished
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
that's
one
of
the
issues
that's
in
contention,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
it
does
not.
the
definitions
cited
in
the
open
space
plan,
there's
really
no
one
single
definition,
but
the
plan
recites
that
for
most
purposes
the
definition
is
something
to
the
effect
that
the
property
shown
as
open
space
should
remain
in
it's
essential,
natural,
or
in
an
open,
condition.
the
city
of
san
diego
interprets
that
to
mean,
not
that
no
development
is
reasonable
or
inconsistent
with
open
space.
in
fact,
the
city
of
san
diego
has
allowed
developments
notwithstanding
an
open
space
designation,
where
we
did
not
have
the
resources
to
purchase
the
property.
and
that's
one
of
the
major
issues,
i
think,
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor,
except
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
and
the
way
it's
come
up,
the
city
of
san
diego
appealed
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
in
the
court
of
appeal
and
on
up
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
them,
and
the
question,
the
findings
on
a
taking,
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
gas
&
electric
company
was
excused
from
applying
for
some
relief
to
avoid
the
problem
that
this
court
saw
in
the
agins
case,
are
really
so
intertwined
and
mixed
with
legal
questions
that
i
don't
think
you
can
completely
separate
them
out
from
factual
findings.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
the
plan
does
not
say
that,
and
nothing
the
city
of
san
diego
did
or
said
contemplated
that
public
use
could
be
made
of
this
property
designated
for
open
space.
there
is--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--it's
to
preserve
land
from
being
developed
or
overdeveloped
and
lost
forever.
it
might
be
used
for
x...
excuse
me.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
the
difference
would
be
that
the
public
is
then
actually
using
the
property.
and
that's
one
of
the
bases
for
the
distinction
between
the
power
of
eminent
domain
and
the
police
power
used
to
regulate
land
use
by
prohibiting
certain
natural
excuses.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
the
public
is
not
using
it
in
any
physical,
sense.
the
property
was
vacant
before
the
city
of
san
diego
designated
it
for
potential
acquisition
in
its
open
space
plan.
it
was
unused
and
the
public
was
enjoying
it
by
driving
by
the
freeway
and
looking
out
to
the
ocean
then
just
as
much
as
in
the--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
absolutely
right.
the
public
had
no
right
to
go
on
that
property.
we
did
not
require
there
be
any
paths,
pedestrian
hikers'
trails,
bicycle
paths,
anything
of
that
sort.
it
was
merely
to
preserve
and
protect
land
that
otherwise
would
have
been
developed.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
your
honor,
that's
something
that
from
this
record
we
don't
know
and
we
will
never
know
until
the
gas
&
electric
company
comes
to
the
city
and
gives
it
the
opportunity
to
interpret
its
own
actions,
its
own
open
space
plan,
to
weigh
and
balance
the
important
public
interest
versus
the
private
property
interest
of
this
landowner
to
determine
what
is
a
reasonable
use
of
the
property,
whether
or
not
we
want
to
preclude
all
use
of
it
by
purchasing
it
so
that
it's
now
in
the
public
domain
and
we
can
do
with
it
what
we
want,
or
whether
we
will
allow
some
use
that
we
consider
to
be
consistent
with
open
spaces.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
including...
especially
including
the
construction
of
a
nuclear
plant.
the
open
space
plan
itself
specifically
says
that
there
shall
not
be
any
per
se
incompatibility
between
properly
building
and
siting
a
nuclear
power
plant
on
this
property.
and
to
that
extent
the
gas
&
electric
company
simply
cannot
start
switching
its
expectations
and
claiming
that
we
had
somehow
deceived
them
because
we
knew
they
had
bought
the
property
for
construction
of
a
power
plant
and
that
we
somehow
pulled
the
rug
out
from
under
them.
the
first
time
we
ever
heard
that
the
gas
&
electric
company
was
thinking
of
other
industrial
uses
for
this
property
was
at
trial
when
they
paraded
out
an
industrial
park
development
plan.
they
had
never
gone
to
the
city
planners,
the
staff,
or
the
city
council
and
said,
what
do
you
think
about
the
possibility
of
us
doing
this?
we
can
no
longer
use
the
property
for
a
power
plant
site.
furthermore,
our
zoning
regulations
allowed
by
conditional
use
permit,
they
could
have
built...
they
could
make
any
use
that
a
public
utility
can
do
by
way
of
structures,
buildings,
or
uses,
by
conditional
use
permit.
even
on
the
agricultural
zoned
portions
of
the
property,
which
were
zoned
agricultural
when
they
bought
the
property,
half
of
it
was
zoned
industrial
when
they
bought
it,
half
of
it
was
zoned
for
agricultural
purposes.
they
could
have
come
in
and
made
use
by
way
of
conditional
use
permit
if
they
had
applied
for
scientific
and
other--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--yes,
your
honor?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
the
only
place,
your
honor,
where...
well,
first
of
all,
from
a
procedural
standpoint
in
california
law,
when
the
case...
the
first
opinion
was
decided
by
the
california
court
of
appeal,
we
sought
further
appeal
by
way
of
a
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court.
when
the
california
supreme
court
granted
that
hearing
under
california
procedure,
that
vacates
and
renders
null
and
void
without
any
force
and
effect
the
court
of
appeal
opinion
which
had
affirmed
the
trial
court's
findings.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
gone.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
believe
that's
so.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
it
vacates
the
court
of
appeal
opinion.
from
that--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
follow
that
question.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes;
which
we
had
asked
them
to
do.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
perhaps
there's
a
semantical
difference,
but
it
doesn't...
my
understanding
is
it
does
not
reinstate
them,
the
court
is
still
open
to
determine
from
the
record
whether
there
is
evidence
to
support
those
findings
of
fact.
and
we
contended
that
there
was
no--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--well,
that
could
be,
your
honor.
but
then
the
next
thing
that
happened,
that
leads
to
my
conclusion
that
they
have
in
fact
been
vacated,
is
this
paragraph
that
we've
been
dealing
with
by
the
court
of
appeal's
second
opinion
after
the
case
was
retransferred
back
to
the
court
of
appeal
after
the
california
supreme--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--your
honor,
i
think
transfer
and
remand,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
are
one
and
the
same.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
know
why
they
use
the
different
terminology,
because
the
california
supreme
court,
i
think,
does
use
"remand"
as
well.
but
when
the
case
went
back,
it's
not
a...
obviously,
from
reading
it,
it's
not
a
model
of
clarity,
but
i
can
see
no
other
interpretation
from
the
language,
especially
when
we
were
contending
that
the
gas
&
electric
company
had
never
applied
for
any
relief,
that
this
zoning
had
never
been
applied
to
them,
and
in
light
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
agins
case,
then
it
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeal
and
they
expressly
state
that
they
have
not
applied
for
any
relief.
why
would
they
make
this--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--yes.
why
would
the
court
make
that
statement
if
they
didn't
feel
that
there
was
merit
to
our
contention
that
they
had
not
been
legally
excused
from
seeking
application?
there
was
no
concrete
controversy
before
the
court.
then
it,
to
reinforce
that
argument,
it
goes
on
a
little
bit
further
in
that
same
paragraph
and
it
said,
its
remedy
if
any
for
alleged
overzealous
use
of
the
police
power
would
be
equitable
relief
other
than
money
damages.
and
the
company
did
in
its
complaint
seek
these
remedies,
asserting
that
the
city
had
arbitrarily
exercised
its
police
power
by
enacting
an
unconstitutional
zoning
law
and
general
plan
elements.
and
then
it
says,
"or
by
applying
the
zoning".
however,
on
the
present
record,
these
are
disputed
fact
issues
not
covered,
so
i
read
that
as
the
court
of
appeal
saying
there
is
no
sufficient
evidence
on
this
record
from
which
the
gas
company's
argument
that
we
had
applied
these
regulations
arbitrarily
is
supported.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
they
go
on
to
say
that
if
the
gas
&
electric
company
wants
to
pursue
its
equitable
remedies,
to
set
aside
these
land
use
and
planning
decisions,
that
they...
because
there's
not
sufficient
evidence
in
the
existing
record...
they
can
retry
that
issue.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
retry
the
taking
issue.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
know
that
they
have
to
dismiss
the
case.
i
think
they're
back
to
the
trial
court
and
they
can
pursue
their
case
on
the
existing
complaint
on--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--they
had
not.
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
taking.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor.
you're
right.
in
other
words,
they
should
not
be
able
to
pursue
their
judicial
remedies
until
they
have
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies,
which
means
finding
out
from
the
city
of
san
diego
what
they
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
do
with
this
property.
then,
if
the
conclusion
results
that
there's
no
reasonable
use
that
the
city's
going
to
allow
them,
because
we
want
to
buy
this
property
for
open
space,
they
can...
you
know,
they've
exhausted
their
relief,
and
the
court
will
not
have
to
sit
as
a
planning
board
or
body,
the
trial
court,
as
it
did
in
the
first
trial
of
this
case,
and
it
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
taking
and
if
there
was
a
taking,
what
follows?
what's
the
remedy?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
not
in
those
specific
words,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
it's--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--well,
the
california
supreme
court
never
really
answered
any
question.
they
simply
sent
the
case
back
after
they
decided
agins
by
saying,
take
another
look
at
it
now
after
we've
told
you
what
the
law
is.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
as
far
as
the
taking
question
which
in...
a
subsidiary
question
of
whether
there
was
a
taking
and
the
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
and
the
futility--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--it
would
take
me
a
few
minutes
to
flip
through
the
pages
to
find
the
specific--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--it
would
be
the
finding
that
there
was
a
denial
of
all
reasonable
use
of
the
property,
and
that
it
would
have
been
futile
for
the
gas
&
electric
company
to
have
applied
for
any
development.
those
are
the--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--yes,
your
honor,
i
can
see
no
reason
why
the
court
would
have
said
that
they
have
not
applied
for
any
relief
or
found
out
what
they
could
do
with
the
property,
unless
they
meant--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--no,
there's
nothing
specific
that
says
that.
they
don't
refer
to
any
findings
either
generally...
either
by
the
word
"findings"
or
by
the
number,
specifically.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
everything
that
the
court
of
appeal
said
is
wiped
out,
in
its
first
opinion.
that
is
gone.
now--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--that's
right.
and
so,
you
eliminate
that
and
then
you
take
what
the
court
of
appeal
is
saying
on
its
second
opinion
that's
being
appealed
from,
and
they
are
mentioning
the
fact
that
they
have
not
applied
for
any
relief.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
think
agins
applies
and
is
controlling
precedent
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
think
the
court
can
get
to
that
issue
without
finding
that
there
was
a
taking,
and--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i
realize
that.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
and
i
think
they
were
dead
wrong--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--on
that,
and
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
but
now,
with
the
court
of
appeal's
second
opinion,
they
seem
to
be
retracting
from
that
position--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--interim
damages
were
not
raised
at
all.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
no,
i
don't
believe
that
interim
damages
would
necessarily
be
awarded
under
the
taking
clause
if--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--that's
my
understanding
of
the
law
in
california,
plus
seven
percent
interest
per
annum
from
the
date
of
the
taking,
plus
attorneys'
fees
and
expert
witness
fees,
if
they
have
to
go
to
court
to
prove
that
there
was
a
taking.
but
i
would
caution
your
honor
that
that's
not
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
far
as
us
declaring
that
that
was
a
park.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
on
what
issue
or
aspect?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
think--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--that's
right.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
they
said
earlier
in
a
decision
that
it's
wiped
off
the
books
and
no
longer
exists.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
as
far
as
interpreting
what
the
court
of
appeal,
was
the
basis
of
its
ruling,
that's
all
we
have,
and
it's
not
entirely
clear.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
of
a
local
ordinance?
it
did.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
think
it's
a
proper
appeal
from
the
standpoint
that
i
think
the
taking
question
can't
be
answered
until
there
is
an
#.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
there
was.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
don't
recall
specifically
if
the
complaint
mentions--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--mentions
the
federal
constitution.
it
may
just
say
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
it
could
have...
could
do
in
a
trial
court?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
certainly,
i
think
they
could.
oh,
is
what
you're
driving
at
is
the
business
about
whether
money
damages
are
appropriate?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
on
the
question
of
damages,
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that's
the
only
particular
question
where
that
statement
would
be--
no,
there
is
probably
some
difference
as
a
result
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
agins.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
no,
i
would
not
agree
that
there
has
been
a
taking.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
we
have
to
be
careful
in
the
sense
of
how
we're
using
the
phrase,
"taking".
and
i
think
that
gets
back
to
the
confusion
from
this
court's
early
decision
in
the
penn
coal
case.
there
may
very
well
be
a
taking
from
a
due
process
standpoint
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
a
denial
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
but
if
you're
meaning
a
taking
from
the
eminent
domain
sense,
that's
where
our
position
is
that
there
is
a
distinction.
and
i
think
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
lot
of
confusion
by
decisions
on
the
tendency
to
blur
the
two
distinct
powers,
the
police
power
and
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
they
are
not,
it's
not
a
difference
in
degree.
--excuse
me.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
your
honor,
it's
not
how
we
characterize,
it's
not
how
we
characterize
it.
it's
whether
or
not
we
are
regulating
through
land
use
means
and
telling
the
landowner
what
uses
may
not
occur
or
may
be
prohibited
as...
and
that's
the
police
power,
as
opposed
to
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
which
is,
we
are
taking
your
property
for
public
use.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well
if
it's
not
exercising
the
police
power,
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
we
call
it.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
court
did
not
award
money
damages
and
title
to
the
property.
they
said
that
the
police
power
regulation
could
not
stand
up
or
it
would
constitute
a
taking.
and
the
constitution
is
satisfied
if
the
restriction
is
not
enforced
or
wiped
off
the
books.
and
so--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
not
under...
this
court
has
never
found
that
a
regulation
can
be
transmuted
into--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--the
only
way
it
could
be
is
if
there
is
some
physical
occupation
or
use
of
the
property,
because--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--well,
there's
no
taking
in
an
eminent
domain
sense,
only
in
the
due
process
sense.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
well,
we're
speaking
of
taking
in
two
complete
different
senses.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
no.
i
think
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
the
distinguishing
factor.
if
we
somehow
give
the
public
the
right
to
go
on
private
property,
then
i
think
you've--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes.
as
long
as
the
landowner
can
make
a
use
of
his
property,
we
have
not
taken
it
for
public
land.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
but
he
can.
we're
not
physically
taking
the
property
away
from
him.
if
you
mean,
by
no
use,
that
he
can't
go
on
his
own
property,
that's
one
thing.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
satisfied.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
i
would
be
satisfied
if
this
court
affirmed
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeal
below.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
right.
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
make
one
comment,
because
i
know
my
time
is
running
out?
the
other
misleading
thing
is
that
the
appellants
are
trying
to
say
that
scope
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
agins,
which
is
relied
on
and
cited
in
this
court
of
appeal
opinion,
that
the
remedy
is
equitable
relief,
not
money
damages,
where
a
taking
through
governmental
regulation
has
occurred.
the
case
is
not
absolute.
counsel
for
appellant
portrays
it
in
his
brief
as
though
the
california
supreme
court
has
created
some
sort
of
immunity.
the
california
supreme
court
has
still
left
the
door
open
for
money
damages
in
land
use
cases
in
certain
circumstances.
one
would
be
unreasonable
precondemnation
conduct.
that
is,
a
public
entity
wants
to
buy
the
property
and
they
start,
you
know,
doing
things
with
an
illicit
motive
in
order
to
reduce
the
value
so
when
we
do
get
around
to
buying
it
we
pay
much
less
than
what
the
property
would
otherwise
be
worth.
the
other
situation,
the
california
supreme
court
has
said,
where
there
is
a
denial
of
access
to
the
property,
they
have
still
left
open
the
door
to
money
damages
on
that
theory
and
where
there
is
special
and
direct
interference
with
the
landowner's
use
of
the
property.
and
there
is
no
evidence
or
facts
on
the
record,
even
the
findings
of
fact,
there
are
no
findings
to
that
effect,
that
we
have
frustrated
any
use
of...
or
refused
a
use
to
develop
the
property.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
under
those
facts,
without
any
actual
use,
without
the
other
factors,
denial
of
access
or
any
direct
and
special
interference
with
the
landowner's
attempt
to
use
the
property,
i
think
that's
a
correct
assessment,
that
the
california
supreme
court
would
say,
no,
your
remedy
is
to
set
aside
the
regulations.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
no
damages,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
in
california,
that's
the
rule--
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
alan
sumption
thank
you,
sir.
