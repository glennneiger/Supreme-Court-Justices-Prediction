mr.
louis
e.
goebel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
case
this
morning
deals
with
the
availability
of
a
money
damage
remedy
for
just
compensation
when
the
oppressive
governmental
conduct
of
a
municipality
denies
a
property
owner
of
all
practical
beneficial
or
economic
use
of
his
property.
in
particular,
this
case
presents
a
question
which
was
left
open
by
the
decision
of
this
court
last
term
in
agins
v.
city
of
tiburon,
namely,
whether
a
state
may
limit
a
property
owner
under
such
circumstances
to
solely
nonmonetary
or
so-called
equitable
remedies.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
there
was
a
taking.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
it
is
disputed.
we--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that's
possible,
your
honor.
in
this
case
we
had
a
fully
developed
trial
record
as
opposed
to
the
agins
case.
the
trial
court
found
a
taking
and
that
taking
was
affirmed
by
the
california
court
of
appeals.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i
don't
believe--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
it's
a...
it
is,
in
effect,
a
remand
of
the
same
case,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
under
california
practice
it
would
have
been
vacated
anyway.
in
this
case,
after
the
california
court
of
appeal,
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
affirmed
the
trial
court
judgment,
the
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing,
which
has
the
effect
of
vacating
the
intermediate
appellate
court's
opinion
anyway.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
they
sent
it
back
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
their
agins
decision.
now,
it's
our
position
that
there
was
no
question
at
that
point
in
time
what
the
basis
for
the
second
california
court
of
appeal
decision
was.
the
california
court
of--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--well,
i
think
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
in
regard
to
this
taking
away
this
judgment,
the
california
court
of
appeal
specifically
stated
that
a
local
agency's
arbitrary,
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power
does
not
require
compensation.
it
was
that
premise
which
caused
the
california
court
of
appeal
to
do
a
180
and
suddenly
take
away
the
judgment
which
only
months
before
they
had
affirmed.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
the
second
time
around,
so
to
speak,
the
california
supreme
court
denied
hearing,
and
therefore
we
brought
this
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
your
honor,
that
was
the
original
intention
at
the
time
of
acquisition
of
this
property
in
1966.
however--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--build
the
plant
or
some
other
industrial
use.
the
property
was
acquired--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--as
it
happens...
i'll
answer
that
on
two
levels,
your
honor.
as
it
happens,
the
plans
of
my
client
have
changed
in
the
intervening
years
and
there's
no
longer
a
desire
to
build
a
power
plant.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
to
devote
the
property
to
a
use
that
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
zoning
and
planning
at
the
time
they
acquired
it,
some
industrial
use.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
a
well-planned,
designed
industrial
park.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
not
the
california
practice
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
the
california
practice
for
these
so...
called
equitable
remedies
is
that
if
the
court,
the
judicial
system
finds
the
action
previously
taken
by
the
municipality
to
be
improper,
the
case
is
simply
remanded
to
the
municipality
for,
to
be
dealt
with
entirely
anew.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
we'd
have
an
opportunity--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that
is
not
the
practice
under
administrative
relief.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i
assume
there
is
power
and
jurisdiction
to
grant
that
relief,
your
honor.
it's
not
the--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--i
think
that
in
light
of
the
decision
in
the
agins
case
and
in
our
case
when
it
was
previously
before
the
courts,
that
that's
not
likely
to
happen.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
well--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--your
honor,
it
is
correct
that
the
property
owner
has
not
submitted
a
specific
development
proposal
to
the
city
and
been
denied.
it
is
our
position
on
this
record,
on
the
factual
record
developed
in
the
trial
court,
that
to
have
done
so
was
totally
impractical
and
futile.
that
was
so
found
by
the
trial
court,
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
remand
and
the
statement
that
i
read
to
your
honor
previously,
that
it
is
clear
that
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeal,
what
caused
the
court
of
appeal
on
the
same
record
to
take
a
180
difference
in
view
was
the
fact
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
said,
even
an
arbitrary,
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power
does
not
require
compensation.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
it
would
have
been
in
the
early
'70s,
your
honor,
prior
to
the--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--a
number
of
changing
concerns
by
the
company,
and
also
the
changing
regulatory
climate
in
california
in
terms
of
environmental
constraints,
building
power
plants
near
the
ocean,
and
so
forth.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
not
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
action,
your
honor.
however,
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
in
the
trial
court
that
after
the
culmination
of
the
several
aspects
of
the
city's
conduct,
the
property
was
unmarketable
and
had
only
a
nominal
fair
market
value.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
effect,
as
a
matter
of
law,
beyond
dispute,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
totality
of
the
city's
conduct
in
june
of
1973,
would
have
been
totally
impractical
and
futile
to
do
so
by
reason
of
the
consistency
policy
which
the
city
had
followed.
and
that
is
that
when
they
enacted
an
open
space
designation
on
a
particular
property,
they
required
any
building
permit
and
any
subdivision
map
on
that
property
to
be
consistent
with
the
open
space
designation.
we
say,
how
can
any
industrial
use
be
consistent
with
open
space?
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
we
believe
that
was
a
cynical--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--it
could
repeal
it
and
modify
it;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
since
that
was
not
the
case
before
the
court,
we
can't
say
for
sure,
your
honor.
there
is
not
any
significant
precedent
in
california
for
interim
damages
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
the
typical
situation
where
there's
a
remand
and
an
invalidation
is
no
interim
damages.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
agins
is
the
controlling
precedent,
and
in
our
view
that's
the
precedent
that
caused
the
court
of
appeal
to
do
a
180
and--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--pardon
me?
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
no,
your
honor,
you
disposed--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--i
want
you
to
declare--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
but
you--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--in
agins,
this
court,
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
found
that
there
was
no
taking,
and
therefore
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
a
state
could
limit
a
property
owner
whose
property
has
been
taken
by
regulatory
conduct
to
equitable
remedies
only.
we
don't
ask
that
you
reverse
agins.
we
simply
ask
that
you
confirm
that
the
fifth
amendment
means
what
it
says,
that
when
there's
a
taking
of
property,
that
just
compensation
is
required,
and
just
compensation
means
money
damages.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
no,
your
honor,
we'd
simply
like
to
have
the
money
judgment
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
settle
precedent
of
this
court
from
pennsylvania
coal
to
penn
central.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
well,
that's
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
the
fact
that
there
is
a
final
decision
of
the
california
courts
that
there
is
a
taking.
my
position
is
that
there
was
a
taking
in
california
established
in
the
trial
court
and
affirmed
on
the
court
of
appeal
until
the
california
supreme
court
changed
things.
it
was
that
part
of
the
judgment--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--in
effect
it
was,
because
the
consequence
of
that
taking,
that
is,
the
flowing
of
money
damages
under
the
fifth
amendment,
was
taken
away
by
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
think
it
is
totally
in
violation
with
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
settled
precedents
of
this
court--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
we
view
that
as
a
very
bizarre--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--position,
your
honor,
and
furthermore,
i
want
to--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--i
think
so.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
in
this
case
that
we're
not
dealing
solely
with
a
state
claim.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
claim
which
was
also
found
to
be
a
federal
constitutional
tort.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
we're
appealing
from
the--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
on
the
second
occasion,
your
honor,
which
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
is
also
found
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
63.
but
it's
our
position
that
this
cause
of
action
that
was
litigated,
found
by
the
trial
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal,
was
not
only
a
state
cause
of
action
but
a
federal
constitutional
tort,
whether
we
call
it
common
law
inverse
condemnation,
a
bivens
tort,
or
in
effect
a
1983
civil
rights
cause
of
action.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
well,
i
won't...
if
i
was
not
faced
with
the
bizarre
position
of
the
california
supreme
court,
i
wouldn't
have
to
take
that
position.
i'm
only
taking
that
position
because
i
think
that
it's
inconsistent
with
this
court's
position
in
owen
v.
the
city
of
independence
to
have
an
unconstitutional
act
of
government
not
be...
utilize
money
damages.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
the
essence
of
it,
your
honor,
whatever
label
we
put
on
it,
it--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
sole
question
that's
open
in
california
courts
as
i
understand
it
is
the
question
of
whether
declaratory
or
equitable
relief
might
be
available.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
no.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
if
you
don't
accept
the
california
court's
position
on
taking,
it's
my
position
that
we
proved
in
the
trial
court...
and
you
can
examine
the
record
and
affirm...
that
there
was
a
taking.
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
you
can
look
at
the
trial
record.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
no,
we
won
below.
we
proved--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--yes.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
only
in
that
court,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
proper
result,
your
honor.
if
the
facts
in
the
record
establish
that
there
was
such
conduct
by
the
government
and
compensation
ought
to
be
paid.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
the
only
question
that
remains
for
the
california
courts
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
they
will
choose
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
to
grant
equitable
relief.
we
say
that
even
if
they
decide
to
grant
equitable
relief,
that's
not
constitutionally
adequate,
because
the
fifth
amendment
requires
more.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
we
want
money,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
yes,
your
honor,
but
it's
our
position
that
the
first
cause
of
action
established
that
a
taking
occurred
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
litigate
that--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--in
state
court,
even...
well,
regardless
of
state
law,
we're
entitled
to
litigate
the
federal
constitutional
tort
aspect
of
those
facts
in
state
court.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
yes.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
but
we
have
seven
years
after
that--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--well,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
the
so-called
set-aside,
those
equitable
remedies
are
constitutionally
inadequate
to
remedy
the
nexus
of
combination
of
facts
which
result
in
what
we
allege
to
be
a
taking.
that
remedy
is
simply
inadequate.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
we're
entitled
to--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--interim
damages.
and
i
don't
think
that
really
puts
us
back
in
our
position,
because
we're
now,
by
that
time
we'd
be--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--if
we
are
to
accept
the
california
supreme
court's
dichotomy
between
these
two
concepts,
i
think
we're
left
with
the
interim
damages
as
a
result
of
the
interim
deprivation
of
use.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
when
that
finally
becomes
a
fact,
it'll
be
ten
to
fifteen
years
after
the
fact
of
the
events
that--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--but,
as
possible,
i
would
hope
that
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--your
honor,
if
you
get
a
chance
to
go
through
the
facts
of
this
case,
it's
our
position
that
we're
not
dealing
with
a
single
ordinance
or
even
two
or
three
ordinances.
we're
dealing
with
the
synergistic
effect
of
a
course
of
conduct
which
resulted
in
a
taking,
much
along
the
formulation
that
was
very
well
discussed
in
the
penn
central
case,
that
these
cases
are
to
be
decided
on
an
ad
hoc
case-by-case
determination.
and
when
you
take
into
consideration
all
the
aspects
and
elements
of
the
course
of
conduct
of
the
city
of
san
diego
in
this
instance,
it
constitutes
a
taking.
that
includes
not
just
one
ordinance,
not
just
two
ordinances,
it
includes
the
fact
that
they
passed
a
resolution
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
acquire
this
property
for
public
use;
it
includes
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
property
is
now
being
devoted
to
public
use,
because
in
fact
the
public
use
originally
sought
was
open
space
and
a
person
now
driving
along
the
interstate
freeway
next
to
this
property
uses
the
property
for
the
very
purpose
that
it
was
originally
sought
by
resolution
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
it's
that
synergistic
effect
of
this
course
of
conduct
that
we
claim
entitles
us
to
compensation
and
it's
that
synergistic
effect
which
we
also
assert
renders
the
equitable
remedies,
or
the
so-called
equitable
remedies,
inadequate.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
of
these
so-called
equitable
remedies,
and
again,
we
believe
that
they
are
inadequate.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor,
and
that
certainly
was
the
understanding
of
the
california
court
of
appeal.
they
said
it
in
so
many
words,
at
page
13
of
the
reply
brief,
or
page
66
of
the
joint
appendix:
"a
local
entity's
arbitrary,
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power
which
deprives
the
owner
of
the
beneficial
use
of
his
land
does
not
require
compensation.
"
they
said
it
point-blank.
that's
the
rule
in
california
as
we
understand
it.
and
it's
that
rule
that
violates
the
federal
constitution
in
our
view,
and
that's
why
we're
asking
this
court
to
act.
but,
further
on
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that's
true.
it
goes
on
to
say
that.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
it
offers
the
property
owners--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that's
correct.
we
view
that
offer
to
be
an
illusory
offer
not
adequate
and
not--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--it's
not
fully--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--it's
not
the
full
equivalent
of
the
property
taken,
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
is
required
under
the
fifth
amendment
from
the
monongahela
case
on
down.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
they
didn't
deal
with
that
question.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
they
did
not
say
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
on
the
basis
of
an
ad
hoc
case-by-case
determination
we
think
there
is
still
a
category
of
cases
where
the
only
satisfactory
remedy
is
money
damages.
we're
not
saying
that--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--for
the
property.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
when
you
have,
as
in
this
case,
a
combination
of
four
or
five
factors
which
through
their
own
synergy
come
together
and
have
the
impact
that
we
claim
was
present
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct.
but
again,
as
the
trial
court
found
and
as
we
assert--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that
question
really
hasn't
been
dealt
with
in
california.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i
would
think
that--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--if
you
could
do
such
a
thing,
your
honor;
if
such
a
thing
were
possible.
and
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
we
say,
at
least
in
a
certain
category
of
cases
the
money
damage
remedy
is
the
only
appropriate
one.
again
i
refer
to
the
owen
v.
city
of
independence
case
where
it
was
stated
that
a
decisionmaker
would
be
derelict
in
his
duties
if
he
didn't
at
some
point
consider
whether
his
decision
comports
with
constitutional
mandates
and
didn't
weigh
the
risk
that
a
violation
might
have
an
effect
upon
the
public
treasure.
it's
this
cost-benefit--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--let
me
try
to
address
that
without
getting
bound
up
in
semantics,
your
honor.
it
is
our
view
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
compensation.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
whether
it's
by
reason
of
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
acts.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
in
our
view,
the
combination
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
led
to
in
june
of
1973
a
taking
of
this
property.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
wrong
to
not
pay.
that's
right.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
right.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
owen--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--that's
right.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
at
the
lower
federal
level.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
it's
stated
the
principle
in
a
number
of
cases
from
pennsylvania
coal
to--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--well,
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
well,
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
kaiser
aetna
decision.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
well,
the
u.s.
v.
causby
is
a
similar
case,
except,
of
course,
the
appellants
would
say
that
involved
aspects
of
physical
invasion.
but
that's
the
type
of
case.
there
are
a
number
of
cases.
each
case
is
different,
though.
that's
why
we've
led
to
the
standard
that
it's
an
ad
hoc
case
by
case
determination.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
well,
i
don't
want
to
be
led
into
the
position
that
we're
asserting
by
reason
of
your
interpretation,
the
interpretation
we're
leading
to
here
on
the
fifth
amendment,
that
we're
asserting
this
is
a
wrongful
taking.
perhaps
if
we
approach
it
salami
style
and
slice
it
up
a
piece
at
a
time--
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
--wrongful
in
the
sense
that
they
did
it
and
they
didn't
pay
for
it.
in
effect,
our
position
is,
this
property
has
been
devoted
to
public
use
since
1973,
has
served
its
purpose,
the
same
purpose
they
wanted
to
condemn
it
for
in
the
first
place.
it's
open
space.
mr.
louis
e.
goebel
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
