agins
is
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
marshall
don't
you
really
want
us
to
reverse
agins?
justice
marshall
we
can't
do
it,
i
don't
think.
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
that
really
what
you
want?
justice
marshall
well,
you
want
us
to
write
an
essay?
justice
marshall
mr.
goebel,
will
you
give
me
in
the
record
exactly
what
you're
appealing
from?
justice
marshall
i'm
speaking
of
an
order
or...
or
something
that
looks
like
an
order.
because
i
don't
know
what
we've
got
here
yet.
justice
marshall
you
need
more
money?
justice
marshall
that's
what
you
want,
money.
mr.
goebel,
your
second
and
third
cause
of
action
in
your
complaint
were
petitions
for
mandate
and
the
relief
prayed
in
paragraph
3
of
your
complaint
was
that
the
court
order
the
city
of
san
diego
to
set
aside
the
rezoning
and
to
set
aside
the
adoption
of
the
open
space
element
of
its
general
plan.
as
i
understand
it,
on
remand,
the
trial
court
may
grant
that
relief,
theoretically.
