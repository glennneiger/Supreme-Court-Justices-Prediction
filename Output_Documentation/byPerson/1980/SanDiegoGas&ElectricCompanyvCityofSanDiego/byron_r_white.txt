justice
white
but
your
premise
is
that
there
was
a
taking
in
this
case?
justice
white
but
that's
disputed,
i
suppose?
justice
white
and
if
we
agreed
with
your
opposition
we
wouldn't
reach
the
question
again.
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeal's
judgment?
justice
white
because
any
further
appeal
was
refused?
justice
white
suppose
you
agreed
with
me
that...
or
agreed
with
the
suggestion
that
there
is
no
final
decision
on
taking
in
the
california
courts.
wouldn't
agins
suggest
that
perhaps
we
shouldn't
decide
the
inverse
condemnation
question,
that
we
should
just
say,
there
is
no
taking?
or
remand
until...
or
just
don't
decide
the
case
until
there
is
a
decision
on
the
taking
issue?
justice
white
well,
then,
where
do
you...
where
do
you
put
your
finger
on
a
final
decision
that
there
is
a
taking,
in
the
california
courts?
justice
white
well,
you're
suggesting
its
wrongful
only
in
the
sense
they
didn't
give
you
any
money?
justice
white
well,
that's
all
right.
and
that's
your
claim.
justice
white
but
assume
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
california
courts
that
the
courts
had
decided,
(a)
there
is
a
taking;
(b)
that
you're
not
entitled
to
any
money,
however;
you're
entitled
only
to
an
injunction.
now,
let's
just
assume
that.
wouldn't
both
issues
be
open
here,
whether
there
is
a
taking
for
federal
constitutional
purposes,
and
then
only
if
there
were,
would
we
reach
the
other
question?
justice
white
yes,
but
we
don't
need
to
accept
the
california
court's
holding
that
there
is
a
taking
for
fifth
amendment
purposes,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
purposes?
justice
white
and
so,
isn't
the
other
side
entitled
to
insist
on
an
affirmance
based
on
the
ground
that
there
is
not
a
taking?
justice
white
but
you
lost
below?
justice
white
no,
but
you
lost...
you're
an
appellant
here.
justice
white
yes,
but
isn't
that
question
open
here?
for
us
to
decide?
justice
white
but
it...
to
be
complete,
it
should
have
said,
but
of
course
he
can
get
his
property
back.
or,
the
restrictions
may
be
invalidated.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
it
doesn't
leave
the
property
owner
without
any
remedy
whatsoever.
he
can
get
the
restrictions
invalidated.
justice
white
well,
it
isn't
illusory.
it's
just
that
meanwhile
you
can't
use
your
property.
justice
white
which
is
a
substantial
matter,
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
can't
use
it
forever.
justice
white
well,
did
the
court
of
appeal
just
right
out,
as
you
say,
indicate
that
there
are
no
interim
damages
either?
justice
white
well,
that's...
so
your
answer
is,
no,
they
did
not
say
that?
justice
white
so
that,
let's
assume
that
the
california
courts
would
say,
you
can't
get...
make
us
buy
the
property
at
the
fair
market
value,
but
we'll
give
you
an
injunction
against
further
enforcement
of
the
restrictions
and
we'll
give
you
interim
damages.
and
would
you
still
say,
well,
we
have
the
right
to
have
you
buy
the
property
from
us?
justice
white
but
you
mean,
for
the
whole
property?
for
the
entire
property?
justice
white
they
would
have
to
take
title
to
the
property
and
pay
you
for
it?
justice
white
well,
just
a
granting
of
a
hearing
doesn't
vacate
the
findings
of
the
superior
court.
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
white
yes,
that's...
suppose
that
it
had
set
aside
the
findings?
justice
white
suppose
the
intermediate
court
had
set
aside
the
findings
of
the
trial
court?
justice
white
and
suppose
it
had...
and
then
there's
a
grant
of
a
hearing
by
the
california
supreme
court,
which
vacates
the
judgment
of
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
doesn't
that
reinstate
the
findings
of
the
trial
court?
justice
white
well,
they
aren't
vacated
until
and
unless
they
reinstate
them,
are
they?
justice
white
in
court,
or
do
they
have
to
dismiss
the
case
and
start
with
the
city?
justice
white
so
they
have
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies,
so
to
speak?
justice
white
well,
i
would
think
you
would
have
dismissed
the
case
until
they
had.
justice
white
they
said
there
was
a
taking.
justice
white
or
at
least
a
full
deprivation
of
the
use
of
the
property.
justice
white
i
know
you
do.
justice
white
i
know
you
do,
but
you
lost
that
in
the
state
courts.
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
sound
like
it
from
what
justice
stewart
read.
it
sounds
like
they
stuck
right
to
their
guns.
well,
but,
don't
you
have
to
read
the
opinion
in
the
light
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint?
didn't
the
appellate
courts
as
a
matter
of
law
in
effect
hold
that
count
one
of
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
that's
the
only
count
on
which
they
ask
for
damages
and
that
was
the
taking
theory,
compensation
for
the
taking.
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
asking
for
interim
damages,
so
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
courts
of
appeals
to
rule
on
whether
not
damages
for
loss
of
interim
use
would
be
recoverable.
isn't
that
true?
justice
white
nobody
ever
raised
or
argued
about
it
at
all,
and
so
all
of
the
language
is
broad.
as
justice
stewart
says,
it's
not
directed
to
the
complaint.
well,
but
if
there
were
a
taking,
a
perfectly
valid
taking
under
california
law,
interim
damages
would
follow
with
general
damages
under
the
taking
clause,
would
it
not?
justice
white
now,
you
think
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
a
local
ordinance?
justice
white
so
that
you
think
this
is
a
proper
appeal
here?
aside
from
finality
questions
it's
a
proper
appeal
in
the
sense
that
the
state
court
rejected
a
claim
that
a
local
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
in
the
federal
constitution.
justice
white
i
understand
that,
but
that's
just
that
there
isn't
any
final
judgment
on
the
taking
issue.
justice
white
but
there
was
a
straightforward
challenge
to
a
local
ordinance
on
the
constitutional
grounds?
justice
white
mr.
sumption,
i
wonder
why
you
weren't
satisfied
with
just
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal?
don't
you
consider
you've
won
the
case?
justice
white
well,
would
you
be
satisfied
if
we
affirmed
on
the
grounds
that
the
california
courts
have
held
that
the
landowner
was
wholly
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
property
and
we
accept
those
findings,
but
that
in
a
sense
that
we
agree
with
the
agins
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
white
well,
suppose
the
california
supreme
court
or
all
the
courts
in
california
declare
the
zoning
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
piece
of
property,
that
the
city
has
unconstitutionally
interfered
with
the
use
of
this
property.
justice
white
now,
has
the
california
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeal
precluded
damages
in
that
situation?
justice
white
well,
they
get
set
aside
but
meanwhile
the
landowner
has
not
been
able
to
use
it
for
the
purpose
he
wanted.
the
zoning
ordinance
has
effectively
precluded
his
use
of
the
property
and
the
supreme
court
has
said
so.
no
damages?
