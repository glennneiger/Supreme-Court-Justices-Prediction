justice
stewart
well,
that
finding
was
never
disavowed
or
reversed,
was
it?
justice
stewart
well,
your
california
court
has
held
that
when
a
taking
is
the
result
of
the
unconstitutional
and
arbitrary
use
of
the
exercise
of
the
police
power,
there
is
no
condemnation,
although
i
expect
that
it
would
hold
that
when
the
taking
is
the
result
of
the
wholly
legitimate
use
of
the
taking
power,
there
is.
it's
rather
odd.
justice
stewart
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
claim,
it
seems
to
me,
under
the
just
compensation
clause
that
this
taking
was
wrongful
in
any
way.
because
the
just
compensation
clause
assumes
that
it
was
a
rightful
taking.
you
take...
the
government
takes
private
property
for
the
use
of
building
a
post
office
or
a
city
hall,
or
a
public
park.
and
it
can
be
quite
legitimate.
you're
still
constitutionally
entitled
to
compensation,
even
if
the
taking
is
wholly
rightful.
justice
stewart
but
your
california
court
has
held,
presumably,
that
while
you
are
entitled
to
compensation
when
the
taking
is
wholly
rightful,
you're
not
entitled
to
it
when
the
taking
is
wrongful.
justice
stewart
it
is
bizarre,
if
that's
the--
justice
stewart
--does
that
correctly
characterize
it?
justice
stewart
g1
of
your
jurisdictional
statement.
justice
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
mixing
up
two
things.
the
just
compensation
clause
of
the
constitution,
of
the
fifth
amendment,
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
presumes
a
perfectly
lawful
taking,
not
a
tort
at
all.
it
is
simply
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
government,
of
its
eminent
domain
power,
to
take
up
private
property
for
public
purposes.
why
do
you
have
to
also
assume
that
this
was
an
improper
taking?
justice
stewart
no
matter
how
far
below
you
go.
the
last
judgment
was
against
you?
justice
stewart
so
you
were
a
loser.
justice
stewart
yes,
where
you
were
a
loser.
but
the...
but
isn't
the
other
side
entitled
to
say
that
you
should
continue
to
lose
and
that
the
last
judgment
that's
being
appealed
should
be
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
there
was
not
a
taking?
justice
stewart
it's
not
clear
to
me,
and
maybe
i'm
repeating
myself,
but
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
you
argue
that
your
client's
entitled
to
money
damages
for
a
wrongful
act
of
san
diego,
or
whether
you're
simply
entitled
to
compensation
because
san
diego
has
taken
your
real
property.
now,
there
is
a
difference.
justice
stewart
yes.
justice
stewart
there
is
a
difference,
but
compensation
results
from
a
perfectly
rightful
taking
of
property.
justice
stewart
so
if
it
had
been
a
perfectly
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
that
would
have
taken
your
property,
you
would
not
have
questioned
the
exercise
of
the
police
power,
you
would
have
simply
said,
please
pay
me
for
the
property
you've
taken.
justice
stewart
not
for
any
wrongful
action
on
the
part
of
san
diego,
except
insofar
as
it
was
wrong
to
not
pay
you.
justice
stewart
we
used
to
have
cases
like
that
quite
frequently
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
6th
circuit,
where
the
claim
was
made
that
the
government
exceeded
its
authorized
power
in
exercising
its
power
of
eminent
domain
for
the
purpose
of
taking
something,
not
for
a
post
office
but
for
some
marginal
purpose.
and
the
issue
was,
had
the
government
rightfully
exercised
its
power
of
eminent
domain?
and
sometimes
it
was
decided
that
it
had,
sometimes
it
was
decided
that
it
hadn't.
when
it
was
decided
that
it
hadn't,
then
the
property
owner
was
always
entitled
to
damages
for
the
tying
up
of
his
property
during
the
period
that
the
case
was
between
the
government
decided
to
take
it
and
the
time
the
case
was
decided.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
a
factual
issue,
and
this
court
isn't
here
to
decide
factual
issues.
justice
stewart
well,
your
brother
is
shaking
his
head,
and
these
are
factual
controversies
that
it's
no
business
of
this
court
to
try
to
resolve.
we're
simply
not
equipped
to
do
it.
mr.
sumption?
justice
stewart
i
thought,
mr....
in
reading
these
briefs,
under
california
law,
everything
that
the
trial
court
says
is
wiped
out,
as
thought
it
hadn't
been
said
at
all,
and
everything
that
the
court
of
appeal
said
in
its
first
opinion
is
wiped
out.
is
that
correct
as
a
matter
of
california
law?
justice
stewart
it's
gone
as
though
it
had
never
been
written.
justice
stewart
well,
here's
what
your
court
of
appeal
said
in
the
opinion
supporting
the
judgment
that
is
appealed
from
here,
at
the
end
of
its
penultimate
paragraph:
"a
local
entity's
arbitrary
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power
which
deprives
the
owner
of
the
beneficial
use
of
his
land
does
not
require
compensation.
"
that's
the
way
they
understand
the
law
of
california,
and
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
whether
or
not
that's
correct,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
stewart
well,
the
court
of
appeal
certainly
got
to
it,
and
disposed
of
it.
they
also
got
to
the
taking
question.
you
took
the
same
position
in
the
lower
courts
and
you
lost.
they
didn't...
they
said,
whatever
the
company
should
or
shouldn't
have
done,
we
nevertheless...
there
is
no
barrier
to
our
reaching
the
taking
question.
they
reached
it.
justice
stewart
just
so
i
can
understand
you,
you
think
that
if
a
state
or
one
of
its
subdivisions
characterizes
its
action
as
an
exercise
of
a
police
power,
then
the
compensation
clause
is
inapplicable?
justice
stewart
but
what
if
you,
in
doing
so,
you
denominate
what
we
are
doing
is
simply
exercising
the
police
power,
the
control
of
safety,
health,
and
morals
of
the
populace?
justice
stewart
which
leaves
you--
--well,
what
about
pennsylvania
coal
v.
mahon,
where
there
was
very
stringent
regulations.
the
court
said,
this
crosses
the
line,
this
is
a
taking,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
called
it
a
regulation.
justice
stewart
well,
then,
is
it
your
view,
mr.
sumption,
that
this
sentence
which
seems
to
me
the
dispositive
holding
of
the
court
of
appeal,
that
"a
local
entity's
arbitrary
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power
which
deprives
the
owner
of
the
beneficial
use
of
his
land
does
not
require
compensation.
"
that
that
language
contains
a
negative
pregnant,
so
to
speak,
a
negative
implication
that
a
local
entity's
rational
and
constitutional
exercise
of
the
police
power,
which
deprives
the
owner
of
the
beneficial
use
of
his
land,
does
require
compensation?
justice
stewart
well,
what
if
it
is,
in
fact?
justice
stewart
that's
not
true.
justice
stewart
well,
in
an
eminent
domain
sense,
government
could
take
property
and
then
leave
it
undeveloped
for
years.
justice
stewart
you
just
give
the
public
a
right
to
look
at
it.
justice
stewart
just
to
look
at
it,
as
they
drive
by
it
on
the
freeway.
justice
stewart
no,
you
say
he
can't
make
any
use
of
it.
he
can't
develop
it
at
all.
