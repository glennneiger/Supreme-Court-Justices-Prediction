mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
at
trial
sought
to
prove
that
the
defendants
had
established
the
appropriate
pay
for
the
job
of
jail
matron
and
then
paid
the
women
incumbents
less.
the
sheriff,
who
is
one
of
the
defendants
and
determined
by
the
trial
court
to
be
an
employer,
testified
that
the
appropriate
way
to
pay
the
jail
matrons
was
to
pay
them
five
percent
less
than
corrections
officers.
he
had
previously
testified
in
depositions
that
he
thought
it
appropriate
that
they
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
the
deputy
sheriffs
who,
at
one
time,
were
the
persons
performing
services
in
the
male
section
of
the
jail.
at
trial
we
sought
to
pursue
this
matter
further.
the
court
terminated
the
line
of
questioning
about
any
pay
differential
with
the
comment
that,
if
the
jobs
are
not
equal,
the
degree
of
pay
differential
or
the
reason
therefore
has
no
relevance.
that
is
at
pages
69
and
70
of
the
record.
the
court
also
terminated
testimony
of
two
other
witnesses
because
he
preferred
to
focus
on
other
issues.
on
the
appeal,
the
9th
circuit--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
the
judge--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--that
is
certainly
true.
this
was
a
calculated
risk
in
this
case.
the
judge
was
impatient,
and
we
felt
confident
we
were
going
to
win
on
other
grounds.
i
did
not
do
it.
it
was
obviously
an
error,
in
hindsight.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
after
reversing,
stating
that
there
should
be
further
proceedings
on
the
question
of
what
kind
of
proof
there
was
of
this
claim.
therefore,
the
question
that
is
being
reviewed
is
whether
title
vii
prohibits
wage
discrimination
for
women
by
an
employer
paying
less
than
the
rate
that
he
has
determined
to
be
appropriate
for
a
job.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
that
the
only
issue
of
comparability
comes
because
the
employer
sought
to
determine
the
appropriateness
of
wages
within
the
jail
setting
by
comparing
one
job
to
another
and
also
by
looking
to
outside
sources.
so
it's
the
employer's
system
that
we
are
looking
to,
and
we
are
saying,
if
the
employer
follows
this
system
and
determines
an
appropriate
rate
of
pay,
then
he
cannot
lower
that
rate
of
pay
because
the
incumbents
are
women.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
it
could
be
attacked
if
there
were
some
reason
to
indicate
that
there
were
sex
factors
being
taken
into
account
in
setting
the
wage
rate,
not--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--i
don't
think
that
that
in
itself
establishes
any
kind
of
intent
because
we
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
we
have
the
matron's
job
which
by
state
statute
was
required
to
be
filled
by
women,
and
we
have
de
facto
segregation
on
the
corrections
officer
side.
there
were
never
any
female
corrections
officers.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
women
were
discouraged
from
applying
and,
in
fact,
there
might
well
have
been
a
male
bfoq
for
that
job,
but
that
was
not
litigated.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that
is
correct.
now,
you
can't
presume
discrimination
just
because
they're
different
jobs,
because,
obviously,
there
are
some
jobs,
where
women
are
the
predominant
or
the
sole
occupants--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--certainly.
and
a
classic
example
is
if
the
employer
uses
a
system,
the
hay
system,
the
mckenzie
system,
or
any
of
those
nationally
known
ones,
determines
what
the
worth
of
the
job
is,
and
then
pays
the
men
that
level
and
pays
the
women
something
less
simply
because
they're
women.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
correct.
they
are
not
the
same
job
and
that's
why
we're
in
this
court
today,
because--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--yes,
but--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--that's
correct.
there
are
kinds
of
discrimination
under
title
vii
in
wages
where
there
is
no
job
comparison
at
all.
the
example
would
be
a
single
sex
occupant
where
the
employer
says,
without
reference
to
anyone
else,
if
you
were
a
male
i
would
pay
you
less;
a
situation
such
as
the
manhart
situation
where
you
have
a
differential
in
take-home
pay
because
of
the
sex
of
the
employee
but
it's
not
with
comparison
to
any
other
job.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
my
view
of
that
is
that
that
fact
alone
would
not
state
a
prima
facie
case,
because
what
title
vii
prohibits
is
discrimination
because
of
sex,
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
plaintiff
is
a
woman
and
she's
comparing
herself
to
a
man
doesn't
create
any
inference
that
there's
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
the
most
obvious
reason
is
discrimination
because
the
jobs
are
different.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
there
certainly
could
be.
and
the
question
that
will
have
to
be--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--yes;
that's
correct.
that's
not
here
in
this
case.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
of
a
prima
facie
case?
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
all
right.
in
this
case...
the
county
in
this
case
has
established
a
system
for
determining
the
value
of
jobs.
that
system
in
this
particular
case
consisted
of
looking
to
outside
markets
and
then
doing
an
internal
evaluation
of
what
one
person
did
versus
another.
based
on
that
they
determined
that
the
appropriate
rate
of
pay
for
corrections
officers
was
one
rate
and
for
matrons
was
one
class
below
that,
which
was
a
five
percent
differential.
they
then
paid
the
women
35
percent
less
than
they
paid
the
corrections
officers.
now,
i
think
it's
quite
possible
in
this
case
that
that
raises
an
inference
that
there
might
have
been
discrimination
involved,
given
the
fact
that
all
the
matrons
are
women
and
all
the
corrections
officers
are
men,
and
it's
somewhat
unusual
for
an
employer
to
go
to
the
problem
of,
go
to
the
trouble
of
evaluating
a
job,
determining
the
appropriate
rate
of
pay,
and
then
pay
one
group
who
are
all
women
less
and
not
men.
but
that
may
not
be
enough.
that...
it's
possible
that
you
have
to
come
in
and
say...
and
i've
got
the
sworn
testimony
of
the
employer
that
says,
yes,
i
did
it,
just
because
that
person
is
a
woman.
now,
there's
a
great
variance
in
what
might
might
be
sufficient
to
raise
an
inference
of
discrimination
but
comparing
it
to
the
standards
for
discrimination
in
hiring
or
promotion,
the
mcdonnell-douglas
type
of
standards,
the
threshold
is
relatively
low,
and
the
court
has
found
that
an
inference
of
discrimination--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--exactly.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
exactly
correct.
yes,
sir.
now,
the
county
can
come
back,
certainly,
and
say,
well,
the
reason
we
paid
the
matrons
less
was
something
having
nothing
to
do
with
their
sex.
they
can
certainly
rebut
the
presumption,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
create
a
threshold
level,
raising
an
inference
at
this
point.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
yes.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
no.
excuse
me.
that's
very
correct.
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
i
think
the
system
is
challengeable
but
they're
going
to
have
to
show
something
that
would
lead
you
to
believe,
even
on
a
prima
facie
case,
that
discrimination
was
involved.
the
problem
you
have
with--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--well,
as
i
understand
the
difference
in
the
situation,
in
the
matron
situation
we
have
two
factors:
one,
it's
totally
sex-segregated,
and
two,
you
have
a
level
of
pay
which
is
then
determined
and
then
the
women
are
paid
less,
so
that's
determined.
now,
as
i
understand,
in
your
hypothetical,
you've
got
a
mixture
of
men
and
women
in
both
jobs.
now--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--i
think
it's
more
questionable
whether
you
have
a
prima
facie
case
when
you
have
a
mix
of
males
and
females
and
you're
paying
that
particular
job
category
less.
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
do
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
as
clear
that
sex
may
have
played
a
factor
in
the
different
way
in
which
the
two
groups
are
treated.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
there
is
nothing
magical
about
a
pay
case
under
title
vii
as
compared
to
any
other
kind
of
a
discrimination
case
under
it.
obviously
there
are
difficult
problems
of
comparisons
and
this
does
not
limit
itself
to
pay
cases
in
either
the
equal
pay
act
or
title
vii.
there
are
difficult
factual
questions
to
be
determined
and
anytime
when
you're
dealing
with
motivation
i
think
it's
important
that--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--absolutely.
i
do
not
think
that
there's
anything
in
the
bennett
amendment
which
can
possibly
be
construed
to
have
such
a
broad
result.
the
only
legislative
history
on
the
bennett
amendment
that
is
relevant
is
that
which
was
at
the
same
time
it
was
enacted,
and
that
was
bennett's
proposal,
that
it
was
being
introduced
as
a
technical
correction
in
order
to
avoid
conflicts
between
the
equal
pay
act
and
title
vii,
and
dirksen's
comment
that
this
was
a
good
idea
because
it
incorporated
the
exceptions,
and
all
it
did
was
incorporate
the
exceptions
of
the
equal
pay
act
into
title
vii.
there
was
no
debate.
it
was
voted
on
and
enacted
on
that
basis.
and
furthermore,
even
the
language
of
the
bennett
amendment
only
says
that
it
is
not
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
differentiate
in
compensation
on
sex
if
such
differentiation
is
authorized
by
the
equal
pay
act.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
look
at
what
the
equal
pay
act
authorizes.
when
congress
was
considering
the
equal
pay
act
it
thought
about
two
things.
it
thought
about
creating
a
standard
requiring
that
there
be
equal
pay
for
equal
work,
or
in
the
alternative
that
there
be
equal
pay
for
comparable
work.
and
that
was
all
it
considered.
and
in
both
of
those
alternatives
it
had
in
mind
a
plaintiff
coming
in
and
being
able
to
say,
i
make
less
than
this
person
over
here,
and
he's
a
man
and
he
does
either
exactly
the
same
thing
or
is
comparable.
therefore,
i
am
entitled
to
recover
unless
the
employer
comes
in
and
proves
that
his
conduct
is
because
of
one
of
the
four
affirmative
defenses.
now
that
is
a
different
kind
of
situation
than
is
required
under
title
vii.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
i
think
the
equal
pay
act
authorized
the
payment
of
different
wages
for
the
same
job
in
four
instances
which
are
the
four
affirmative
defenses,
seniority
system,
merit
system,
productivity
and
quantity
or
any
factor
other
than
sex.
and
that's
what
it
authorized.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
the
first
three,
the
seniority
system
and
the
merit
system,
and
the
quantity
or
quality
of
production,
are
already
in
section
703(h)
of
title
vii.
the
fourth
one,
any
factor
other
than
sex,
is
not.
and
the
petitioner
has
said
that
that
doesn't
really
mean
anything
because
it's
just
surplus
verbiage,
but
that
was
certainly
not
the
intent
of
the
law.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
it's
interesting
that
the
defense
of
any
factor
other
than
sex
came
out
of
the
equal
pay
act
and
the
equal
pay
act
says
the
same
thing.
you
don't
have
a
violation
of
the
equal
pay
act
unless
it's
sex,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
but
it's
a
defense
if
it's
in
effect
the
other--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--so
they
obviously
thought
it
meant
something,
and
it
must
mean
the
same
thing--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--and
it
has
been...
well,
it
has
been
used--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--well,
i
think
it's
been
interpreted
to
bear
on
the
burden
of
going
forward
for
the
parties,
and
the
inference
of
sex
being
a
factor
created
in
a
prima
facie
case
can
be
rebutted
by
showing
that
it's
some
factor
other
than
sex,
under
either
title
vii
or
under
the
equal
pay
act.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
but,
i
agree...
i
think
that
in
the
drafting
of
both
statutes
that
there
are
some
words
that
may
not
have
needed
to
be
there,
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
that
indicates
that
congress
intended
the
wholesale
change
of
title
vii
which
the
petitioners'
construction
would
have.
now,
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
kinds
of
instances
of
discrimination
which
should
by
the
clear
language
of
703(a)
be
recoverable
under
title
vii,
but
i'm
sure
congress
never
thought
of
that
in
the
equal
pay
act,
and
if
they
thought
about
them
they
were
not
trying
to
deal
with
them,
and
certainly
not
at
the
time
they
incorporated
the
bennett
amendment.
and
bear
in
mind
that
these
types
of
discrimination
would
only
affect
women,
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
completely
change
title
vii
to
so
limit
the
rights
for
women
and
to
provide
protections
for
other
protected
groups.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
i
subscribe
fully
to
the
theory
that
he
had
in
mind
that
he
wanted
the
bill
not
to
be
enacted
because
sex
was
included,
but
that
isn't
what
happened,
and
i
don't
think
that
too
much
can
be
put
for
that
now
at
this
time.
i
am
sure
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
women
would
receive
the
same
benefits
under
title
vii
as
any
other
protected
class.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
correct.
the
equal
pay
act
clearly
speaks
only
to
pay
differentials.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
that's
correct.
but
there
are
a
wide
variety
of
places
in
which
that
does
not
do
women
any
good
and
this
is
a
prime
example,
because
they
are
sex-segregated
jobs
and
they
can't
just
go
out
and
find
either
a
male
comparator
in
their
own
job
or,
in
this
case,
even
go
to
the
corrections
officers'
position.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
our
contention
is
that
access
is
illusory.
we
did
not
pursue
that
in
the
trial
because
it
was
not
really
an
issue,
but
the
fact
is
that
there
never
had
been
one
that
really
discouraged--
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
--it
was
noted,
yes,
in
the
court,
that
the
corrections
officer's
position
was
open
to
women.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
as
a
finding.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
by
the
district
court.
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
a.
hewitt
there
are
women
deputy
sheriffs,
but
now
that
the
deputy
sheriffs
for
a
time
were
in
the
jail
doing
the
corrections
officers'
job.
there
were
no
women
at
that
time,
so
there
have
never
been
any
women
on
the
male
side
of
the
jail,
but
there
are
now
women
who
are
deputies
who
do
the
general
police
patrol
work.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
in
this
case
the
kinds
of
discrimination
in
pay
which
title
vii
would
prohibit
if
the
petitioners'
contention
were
correct.
and
that
includes
the
situation
that
even
he
mentioned,
which
is
someone
saying
to
an
employee,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you
as
much
as
if
you're
a
man.
it
includes
a
lot
of
situations
where
you
would
have
a
discriminatory
impact.
for
instance,
if
an
employer
determined
that
he
was
going
to
pay
extra
pay
for
combat
experience,
which
obviously
would
prejudice
women,
under
the
analysis
of
the
petitioner,
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right.
in
the

situation,
you
couldn't
hire
somebody
on
a
sex-plus
theory
if
they
had
pre-school
age
children,
but
you
could
pay
them
less
because
they
did.
you
could
pay
a
head
of
household
more,
which
would
impact
against
women.
all
of
these
kinds
of
cases
have
no
bearing
whatever
on
comparing
one
job
to
another.
it's
clear
that
in
congress's
contemplation
of
the
equal
pay
act,
what
they
were
worried
about
was,
as
they
expressed
it,
legions
of
government
bureaucrats
coming
into
businesses
and
telling
them
how
much
one
job
was
worth
versus
another.
we
don't
have
that
situation
in
this
case
because
we're
relying
on
the
county's
own
system
of
valuing
jobs
for
a
starting
point,
and
then
what
they
did
to
discount
that.
also,
that
is
not
the
situation
in
most
of
what
i
have
described
as
the
pay
discrimination.
