mr.
barry
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
state
the
government's
interest
in
this
issue,
but
before
i
do
i'd
like
to
pick
up
on
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
bfoq.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
bfoq
analogy
doesn't
carry
you
very
far
in
this
area
because--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--well,
i
believe
it's
also
applicable
to
members
of
religious
groups,
and
i
think
that
the
rationale
is
that
there
are
some
legitimate
purposes
that
congress--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--wanted
to
protect,
as
there--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--such
as
pay
discrimination.
the
government's
interest
here
rests
on
the
district
court's
holding
that
sex-based
compensation
discrimination
is
actionable
under
title
vii
only
if
the
particular
acts
of
discrimination
would
also
be
actionable
under
the
equal
pay
act.
in
other
words,
an
employer
could
admit
to
a
woman
employee
that
he
would
pay
her
at
a
higher
rate
if
she
were
not
a
woman,
or
he
could
give
a
bonus
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
work
to
only
male
employees,
or
he
could
give
a
cost
of
living
increase
that
bore
no
relationship
to
the
duties
performed
only
to
male
employees.
and
this
would
not
violate
title
vii
in
petitioners'
view.
the
effect
of
this
theory--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
it
would
violate
the
equal
pay
act
only
in
those
circumstances
in
which
a
male
and
a
female
were
doing
exactly
the
same
job--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--within
the
definition.
however,
as
to--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--that's
right.
but
if
you
assume
that
work
forces
are
not
made
up
of
people
who
all
have
the
same
jobs,
as
the
court
assumed
in
manhart--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--then
the
point
is
that
a
good
deal
of
discrimination
could
be
allowed
to
occur
simply
because
the
jobs
were
not
equal
under
the
equal
pay
act.
and
if
you
assumed
that
the
factor
that
is
causing
this
discrimination
is
a
factor
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
duties
that
are
being
performed
by
the
various
people
who
are
working
here,
then
it
clearly
would
violate
title
vii
in
our
view,
but
it
would
not
violate
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
the
government
has
not
taken
a
position
as
to
that
question
in
our
brief.
and
the
reason
that
we
haven't
is
that
we
believe
that,
quite
frankly,
we
don't
understand
what
this
comparability
theory
is.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
theory
of
our
brief
does
not
depend
on
the
comparability
issue.
the
theory
of
our
brief
is
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
what
petitioners
say
the
bennett
amendment
means
is
simply
not
persuasive.
and
once
that
has
been
decided,
then
the
lower
federal
courts
will
have
an
opportunity
to
determine
such
questions
as
whether
particular
kinds
of
proof
are
relevant
in
these
cases,
which
i
think
is
the
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
barry
sullivan
to
prove
sex
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
section
703(a)
of
title
vii.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
inconsistent
in
the
9th
circuit's
opinion
with
what
i've
said.
essentially,
the
9th
circuit
has
said
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
further
development
of
the
factual
record.
and
i
might
add
that
the
other
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
been
rendered
on
this
question
are
not
particularly
helpful
in
that
they
either
reject
the
notion
that
703(a)
is
left
intact
after
the
bennett
amendment
or
they
accept
that.
and
there
isn't
really
very
much
discussion,
despite
the
number
of
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
on
this--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
comment--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
that's
the
issue
that's...
that's
correct.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
with
respect
to
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case,
if
you
accept
our
construction
of
the
bennett
amendment,
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
violation
of
the
equal
pay
act
alleged,
but
we
would
submit
there
would
be
a
violation
of
title
vii.
but
that
is
a
problem.
mr.
barry
sullivan
that's
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
well,
i
think
that
in
the
teamsters
decision
the
court
said
that
despite
all
of
the
work
that
gone
into
mcdonnell-douglas,
that
mcdonnell-douglas
was
simply
one
paradigm
for
proving
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
and
that
there
were
other
ways
of
proving
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
and
that's
simply
all
we're
saying
here,
is
that
that's
essentially
a
fact-bound
question
in
every
case.
some
facts
may
be
persuasive
in
one
case;
they
may
create
a
strong
inference
of
discrimination
in
the
circumstances
of
one
case,
and
without
any
factual
record
to
speak
of
in
this
case--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
think
that
is
correct.
that
is
not
the--
mr.
barry
sullivan
--i
believe
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
barry
sullivan
no.
we
submit
that
the
question
that
the
government
has
raised
here
is
the
threshold
question
that
must
be
addressed
in
any
event.
mr.
barry
sullivan
no.
that's
not
my
view.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
think,
ordinarily,
they
don't.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
context
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting
might
be.
mr.
barry
sullivan
i
have
been
personally
aware
of
that.
