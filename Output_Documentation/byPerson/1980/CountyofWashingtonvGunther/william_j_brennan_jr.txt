justice
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
ask
mr.
derr,
i
gather
on
the
equal
pay
act
where
we
deal,
i
suppose,
with
something
like
identical
jobs
in
the
sense,
for
example,
of
an
airline
steward,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
male
or
female,
they
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
here,
i
gather,
there
are
differences
in
the
job
duties
of
the
female
guards
and
the
male
guards,
are
there?
justice
jr.
to
that
extent
there's
no
identity
of
duty
between
the
male
and
female
jobs
here,
as
there
would
be
in
my
hypothetical
of
the
airline
steward?
justice
jr.
well,
isn't
it
your
position
now,
mr.
derr,
that
unless
the
guards
have
a
case
under
the
equal
pay
act,
they
have
none
under
title
vii?
yes.
justice
jr.
unless
they're
like
my
hypothetical
of
the
airline
steward's
job?
justice
jr.
unless
it's
like
that...
and
since
the
finding
here
by
two
courts
is,
it's
not,
you
say
there's
no
title
vii
claim?
justice
jr.
you
mean
the
matrons
might
have
had
access
to
the
males'
jobs?
justice
jr.
of
superintending
male
prisoners?
justice
jr.
what
was
that
standard?
justice
jr.
what
of
the
bennett
amendment,
mr.
derr?
justice
jr.
take
your
time.
justice
jr.
that
was
almost
a
happenstance,
as
i
recall,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
well,
what
should
we
do,
mr.
derr?
what
weight
should
we
give
senator
bennett's
1965
clarification?
justice
jr.
that
was
two,
three
years
later,
wasn't
it?
justice
jr.
one
year
later.
justice
jr.
--but
haven't
we
quite
frequently
suggested
that
you
have
to
proceed
very
cautiously
in
giving
any
weight
to
post-enactment
statements
of
what
he
meant
by
even
sponsors
of
legislation?
justice
jr.
are
you
saying
that
here,
for
example,
they
priced
the
corrections
officer,
a
male
job,
at
$500
a
month;
they
priced
the
women's,
matron's
job
at
$400
a
month,
but
then
they
paid
the
corrections
officers
five
but
the
women
350?
justice
jr.
that's
what
you
say
this
case
is?
justice
jr.
in
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
jr.
but
you
do
reject
the
argument
of
your
brother
that
there
can't
be
a
title
vii
case
unless
you
can
prove
an
equal
pay
violation?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
mrs.
hewitt,
i
thought
you...
did
you
not
say
earlier,
there's
not
ever
been
a
female
in
the
corrections
officer's
job?
but
what
about
your
brother's
suggestion
to
us,
however,
that
access
to
corrections
officers'
jobs
is
available
to
females?
justice
jr.
well,
is
there
any
finding
by
either
of
the
lower
courts
that
there
is
access
to
the
corrections
officer's?
justice
jr.
as
a
finding?
justice
jr.
by
whom,
the
district
court?
