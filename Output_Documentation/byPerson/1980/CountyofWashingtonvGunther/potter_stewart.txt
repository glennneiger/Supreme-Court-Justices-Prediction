justice

in
that
area
you
could...
i'm
sure
your
sister
will
disagree
with
this,
or
the
extent
of
this,
but
in
the
extreme
logic
of
it
you
could
compare
the
wage
rights
of
truck
drivers
with
that
of
secretaries,
for
example.
justice
stewart
even
though
your
current
force
is
100
percent
female?
justice
stewart
they
don't
have
to
be;
that's
the
point.
the
9th
circuit
says
they
do.
justice
stewart
another
criterion
would
be
the
economic
contribution
made
by
the
job.
justice
stewart
well,
let's
say
all
the
salesmen
were
men
and
all
the
secretaries
were
women.
justice
stewart
these
are
clearly
different
jobs,
secretary
and
salesmen.
and--
justice
stewart
--but
your
point
is
that
there
can
be
discrimination
even
though
the
jobs
are
quite
different?
justice
stewart
they
equal.
but
not
for
the
same
job?
justice
stewart
it
pays
the
jobs
differently,
even
though...
and
it
turns
out
that
in
one
job
category
100
percent
of
the
occupants
are
female
and
in
the
other
100
percent
are
male.
now,
that
would
be
a
prima
facie
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
but
your
argument
says,
tells
us,
that
there
could
be
a
case
of
a
discrimination
even
though
the
jobs
are
quite
different.
isn't
that
it?
justice
stewart
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
title
vii
if
the
alleged
discrimination
was
based
on
a
factor
other
than
sex...
race
or--
justice
stewart
--any
other
statutory
criterion.
justice
stewart
it's
surplusage
in
those
cases,
is
the
argument.
justice
stewart
what
do
you
think
it
means?
justice
stewart
what
do
you
think
it
means
if
it
says
"there
shall
be
no
violation
of
this
act
if
there
is
no
violation
of
this
act?
"
justice
stewart
and
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
that
statutory
provision
were
there
or
not.
justice
stewart
well,
except
that
women,
you
concede,
are
the
only
group
protected
by
title
vii,
where,
for
whom
there's
a
bfoq?
justice
stewart
and
also,
i
think,
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
as
i
understand
your
colleague's
argument,
it
is
that
the
equal
pay
act
is
the
sole
criterion
only
when
the
claim
is
a
differential
in
compensation,
not
where
the
claim
is
something
else,
a
promotion,
or
hiring,
or
whatever?
justice
stewart
and
your
colleague's
argument,
even
at
its
broadest
extent,
would
tell
us
that
the
title
vii
is
satisfied
if
the
equal
pay
act
is
satisfied
in
a
claim
devoted
exclusively
to
differentials
in
compensation?
justice
stewart
well,
really,
i
agree
with
you,
and
the
only
reason
i
raised
that
was
to
qualify
the
claim
that
women
are
treated
exactly
like
every
other
protected
group
under
title
vii.
and
there's
certainly
a
very
explicit
exception
to
that
generalized
statement
in
the
bfoq,
which
is
applicable
only
to
women.
and
that
was
the
only
purpose--
justice
stewart
--right.
and
there
are
not--
justice
stewart
--statutorily,
for
the
other
groups
protected.
justice
stewart
because
it
would
not
violate
the
equal
pay
act?
justice
stewart
and
why
wouldn't
it
violate
the
equal
pay
act,
that
latter
example?
justice
stewart
exactly.
justice
stewart
exactly.
and
you
can't
give
the
same
base
pay
to
women
and
men,
but
give
the
bonuses
only
to
men
under
the
equal
pay
act,
can
you?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
and
really,
your
argument
is
simply
that
there
can
be
a
violation
of
title
vii
with
respect
to
compensation
even
though
there's
no
violation
of
the
equal
pay
act?
justice
stewart
and
that's
really
the
broad
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well
there's
one
that
we
don't
understand
at
this
moment
what
purpose
much
further
discussion
would
serve
since
nobody
seems
to
understand
what
would
be
involved.
justice
stewart
well,
that's...
the
real
issue
is
the
one
you
stated,
isn't
it?
whether...
what
effect
the
bennett
amendment
had,
and
did
it
serve
to
say
that
there
can
be
a
violation
of
title
vii
in
this
context
only
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
pay
act,
or
did
it
not?
and
that,
you
say,
is
what
the
courts
have
decided.
and
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
decide.
justice
stewart
but
you
want
us
to
leave
it
to
further
development
in
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals?
