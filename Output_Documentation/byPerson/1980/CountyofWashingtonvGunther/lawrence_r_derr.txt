mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
sex-based
wage
discrimination
claims
are
subject
to
a
different
standard
of
proof
when
such
claims
are
asserted
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
than
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
standard
of
the
equal
pay
act
of
1963.
the
respondents
are
former
employees
of
the
petitioner,
washington
county.
the
respondents
were
jail
matrons
who
guarded
female
prisoners
in
the
county
jail
and
had
other
clerical
duties.
the
male
prisoners
were
guarded
by
deputy
sheriffs
and
later
by
corrections
officers.
the
respondents
filed
this
case
in
the
federal
district
court
alleging
that
they
had
received
compensation
lower
than
that
received
by
their
male
counterparts
doing
substantially
the
same
work.
they
also
raised
a
claim
that
their
jobs
had
been
terminated
in
retaliation
for
making
that
equal
pay
claim
and
that
they
had
been
refused
the
right
to
be
rehired,
also
in
retaliation.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
jobs
were
substantially
dissimilar
on
the
facts,
and
therefore
denied
the
equal
pay
claim.
it
also
found
that
there
was
no
retaliatory
reaction,
that
there
were
good
business
reasons
for
the
fact
that
the
jobs
were
terminated.
and
those
had
to
do
with
providing
additional
space
in
the
jail
to
respond
to
an
overcrowding
problem,
an
aclu
suit.
in
a
post-trial
brief
after
the
facts
were
in,
the
respondents
raised
for
the
first
time
the
claim
that
even
if
the
jobs
were
not
equal,
that
the
great
differential
in
pay
between
the
comparison
jobs
could
only
be
at
least
partially
explained
by
sex
discrimination.
the
only
evidence
pointed
to
were
the
very
pay
scales
which
caused
the
source
of
the
comparison.
the
trial
court
held
on
the
basis
of
the
laws
that
existed
prior
to
this
case
that
since
the
equal
pay
act
standards
applied
and
since
the
jobs
were
substantially
dissimilar,
that
is,
not
substantially
equal,
that
the
judge
had
no
authority
to
override
the
wage
rates
set
by
the
employer
and
the
union
in
this
case.
the
respondents
appealed
to
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
raised
one
other
point
of
fact
found
in
the
record,
and
that
was
a
statement
by
the
sheriff
of
the
county
that
at
one
point
in
time
he
felt
that
the
matrons,
the
respondents
here,
should
have
been
paid
more
than
they
were
being
paid.
no
other
evidence
was
asserted
as
supporting
this
comparison
of
jobs
as
opposed...
unequal
jobs
as
opposed
to
equal
jobs.
one
other
assertion
was
made
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
to
the
9th
circuit
by
the
respondents,
and
that
is
that
they
were
prevented
during
the
trial
from
introducing
additional
information
to
support
their
comparable
job
claim.
however,
they
have
never
pointed
to
what
that
evidence
was
nor
anyplace
in
the
record
where
they
were
denied
that
right.
and,
in
fact,
it's
hard
to
understand
how
that
could
be
the
case
since
the
claim
was
first
raised
in
post-trial
briefing,
not
in
the
complaint
or
the
pre-trial
order.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
comparable
work
is
simply
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
of
an
open-ended
interpretation
of
title
vii
in
the
area
of
sex
discrimination.
the
concept
of
equal
work
is
one
that
is
defined
by
the
statute
and
through
case
refinements,
that's
a
concept
that's
understood.
but
if
that
limitation
that
started
in
the
equal
pay
act
is
not
applied
as
well
to
title
vii,
then
any
theory
is
available
to
a
plaintiff
or
a
claimant
to
attempt
to
show
that
there
was
discrimination
based
on
sex.
comparable
work
is
one
of
those
theories
and
there
are
many
versions
and
explanations
of
it.
in
essence,
it
amounts
to
comparing
the
value
of
different
jobs
to
the
employer,
then
comparing
the
wages,
and
drawing
a
deduction
from
a
difference
between
value
and
wages
that
sex
discrimination
is
the
motivation,
and
i
think
by
the
explanation--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--very
definitely.
there's
absolutely
no
limitation
upon
the
comparisons
that
can
be
drawn,
only
in
the
ability
of
the
analysis
to
make
any
rational
connection.
and
of
course,
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
method
of
proof
that
it
has
outlined
and
recently
described
in
the
texas
v.
burdine
case.
the
burden
of
proof,
although
it
involves
intent,
is
initially
on
the
plaintiff
only
to
show
a
prima
facie
case,
to
show
a
set
of
circumstances
that
create
an
inference
that
there
may
have
been
discriminatory
motive.
at
that
threshold
level
the
courts
will
already
be
into
the
type
of
a
situation
which
congress
did
not
intend
them
to
get
into,
and
that's
attempting
to
evaluate
different
jobs
and
the
relative
value
of
those
jobs.
in
other
words,
at
the
very
threshold
level
of
determining
whether
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
in
these
comparison-of-unequal-job
sort
of
cases,
the
courts
will
have
to
make
an
analysis,
a
subjective
analysis
that
congress
did
not
intend.
but
you--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--that's
correct.
that
issue
was--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
case
presents
the
issue
squarely,
because--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--and
that
was
uphold
by
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
and
that's
not
contested
by
respondents.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct.
there
is
no
claim
of
denial
of
access,
and
in
fact
there
is
a
finding
in
the
record
by
the
trial
courts
and
i
believe
noted
by
the
9th
circuit
that
there
was
access
to
the
higher
paid
jobs.
these
respondents
are
claiming
larger
pay
for
the
jobs
that
they
were
in
and
not
disputing
the
fact
that
they
had
access
to
the
higher
paying
jobs.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
no,
that
hypothetical
was
raised
by
the
9th
circuit.
they
stated
it
as
though
the
employer
would
say
to
a
female
employee,
if
you
were
a
man
i
would
pay
you
more.
the
9th
circuit
felt
that
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
equal
pay
act
and
we
disagreed.
judge
van
dusen
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
3rd
circuit
in
the
iue
v.
westinghouse
case
disagreed
that
the
fault--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--for
wage-based
sex
discrimination.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
equal
pay
act
is
an
intentional
act.
it
does
require
an
attempt
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex,
and
that's
true
because
one
of
the
defenses
is
that
if
the
discrimination
is
based
on--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
i
may
respond
to
the
hypothetical,
there
are
remedies
and
one
of
them
is
an
improper
interpretation
of
the
equal
pay
act.
the
9th
circuit,
i
believe,
felt
that
unless
there
was
an
incumbent
in
the
male
job
that
was
being
used
for
comparison,
there
could
be
no
equal
pay
act
violation.
the
department
of
labor
has
since
the
early
days
of
the
equal
pay
act
had
a
regulation...
i
believe
it's
29
cfr
800.114(c)...
which
clearly
indicates
that
you
may
look
to
successors
and
predecessors
in
the
job,
and--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--that's
right.
the
best
example
is
a
situation
where
there
was
just
one
person
holding
the
job.
if
the
person
is
a
female
and
is
terminated
or
leaves
and
a
male
comes
into
that
particular
job,
it's
possible
to
make
that
comparison.
that's
consistent
with
the
interpretation
of
the
department
of
labor
and
there
are
cases
that
have
held.
the
thing
that
takes
the
next
step
and
makes
the
equal
pay
act
the
sort
of
remedy
that
it
should
be
is
to
recognize
that
if
the
employer
hypothesizes
a
male
employee
as
perhaps
the
next
incumbent,
that
should
be
no
different
than
having
to
wait
until
the
time
that
that
next
incumbent
comes
along.
and
so
that
the
employer
who
makes
the
statement
that
i
would
pay
a
man
more,
or,
i
will
pay
you
less
than
i
would
a
man,
has
made
a
comparison
of
necessity
and
by
definition
to
equal
work
and
has
shown
a
violation
of
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
relationship
of
bona
fide
qualification,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
yes,
definitely.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
matron's
job
was
an
exclusively
female
category
of
job.
but
the
higher-paying
jobs
were
open
to
the
females.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
yes.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
jobs
do
not
exist...
well,
the
matrons'
jobs
do
not
exist.
the
deputy
sheriffs,
there
are
female
incumbents
in
those
jobs.
i'm
not
certain
whether
there
are
any
female
corrections
officers
at
the
moment.
there
were
not
during
this
period
of
time.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
but
they
are
definitely
open;
that
was
a
finding
of
the
case--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--a
corrections
officer?
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
and
the
deputy
sheriffs,
because
this
covers
a
period
of
time
when
the
deputies
in
a
rotation
were
doing
the
jail
guarding
and
later
when
the
corrections
officers
were
doing
it
exclusively.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
there
are
deputy
sheriffs
who
are
female.
i
do
not
know
whether
there
are
any
corrections
officers.
there
were
not
in
the
period
of
less
than
a
year
that
that
was
pertinent
in
this
case.
the
reason
that--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--that's
true,
but
under
another
provision
of
title
vii
which
is
unaffected
by
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
it
would
present
a
case
that
could
be
brought
under
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
yes;
if
it
had
to
deal
with
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that
appears
to
me
to
be
a
compensation
case
and
most
likely
would
be
a
case
that
could
be
brought
under
the
equal
pay
act
standard
and
therefore
must
be.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
well,
that
would
present
a
question
whether
it
involved
some
other
factor
other
than
wages
and
compensation,
and
i
would
prefer
not
to
venture
a
guess
as
to
how
that
might
be
interpreted
by
a
court,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
was
interpreted
to
be
a
legal
question,
it
would
not.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
on
an
overtime
pay?
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
it
appears
to
me
that
that
would
be
directly
related
to
wages,
and
if
they
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
work
the
overtime
it
would
affect
wages.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that
appears
to
me
to
be
a
wage
case.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
any
more
than
the
truck
driver
and
the
secretary
situation.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
well--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--the
9th
circuit
is
reading
the
substantially
equal
limitation
out
of
title
vii,
which
congress
intended
to
be
there
as
carrying
into
it
from
the
equal
pay
act.
we're
talking
about
comparison
of
jobs
that
are
not
substantially
equal.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
your
honor,
they
attempt
to.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
they
eliminate
the
equal
pay
standard,
and
having
done
that
they
leave
no
standard
other
than
sex-based
wage
discrimination.
the
9th
circuit
attempts
to
distinguish
by
saying
that
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
compare
jobs,
as
they
understand
it,
without
other
evidence.
the
only
other
evidence
would
be
evidence
of
intent
and
we
submit
that
the
claimants
will
say
that
intent
is
inferred
from
the
comparisons
that
we
draw,
and
they'd
certainly
be
entitled
to
raise
that
as
a
claim
and
will
raise
it
as
a
claim,
and
that
will
then
be
a
decision
for
the
court
to
make
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
sufficient
to
present
a
prima
facie
case.
but
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
9th
circuit
to
say
that
they
are
not
allowing
cases
based
on
comparison
of
comparable
but
not
equal
jobs
is
simply
not
warranted
by
the
position
they've
taken.
the
9th
circuit
certainly
has
no
ability
to
rewrite
the
statute
and
there's
nothing
to
be
found
in
the
statute
that
would
say
that.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
that
and
any
even
more
disparate
sort
of
comparison
that
you
might
choose
to
make
because
they've
said
that
there
is
no
such
limitation.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
certainly.
one
of
the
problems,
of
course,
with
the
comparable
work
question
which
the
9th
circuit's
interpretation
opens
the
door
to
is
that
there
is
no
clear
understanding
of
what
sort
of
economic
or
professional
valuation
methods
would
be
used
to
apply
it.
and
i
am
not
here
prepared
to
explain
to
the
court
how
it
would
be
done
because,
frankly,
i
do
not
know.
but
i
do
know
that
those
claims
would
be
available.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct.
the
important
point
to
remember
in
understanding
why
congress
chose
this
is
to
be
the
state
of
affairs,
that
is,
that
sex-based
wage
discriminations
would
be
limited
to
the
standards
of
the
equal
pay
act,
is
that
it
considered
these
questions
in
1962
and
1963.
the
evidence
was
presented
to
congress
in
great
detail
that
there
were
allegations
of
dual
standards
of
pay
between
males
and
females,
that
there
was
avowed
intentional
sex
discrimination;
congress
was
well
aware
of
that.
secretary
of
labor
arthur
goldberg
and
his
assistant,
esther
peterson,
representatives
of
the
unions,
presented
that
information
to
congress
and
urged
that
a
comparable
work
standard,
which
was
in
the
original
proposal
before
congress,
be
adopted.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
standard
was
first
worded
as
requiring
that
comparable
pay
be
made
for
comparable
work.
that
was
the
bare
bones
initial
statement
that
evolved
to
add
some
modifiers
as
to
skill.
congress
had
great
concern
with
that,
and
moved
to
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
standard
and
in
so
doing
also
added
definitions
and
eliminated
the
per
se
or
the
strict
liability
character
of
the
act
by
adding,
as
a
defense
that
if
the
pay,
even
though
for
equal
jobs,
was
disequal,
unequal,
but
if
there
was
any
factor
other
than
sex
involved,
then
it
would
not
violate
the
equal
pay
act.
congress
didn't
do
that
because
it
didn't
see
the
problems
because
the
problems
were
not
pointed
out
to
it;
they
were.
it
did
it
because
it
saw
greater
problems
in
getting
the
department
of
labor,
the
federal
government,
and
the
courts
into
the
sort
of
evaluations
of
employers'
wage
schedules,
that
the
court
has
addressed
its
questions
to
here
today.
that's
a
policy
question.
we're
not
here
arguing
a
policy.
we're
simply
saying
that
congress
in
1962
and
1963
addressed
that
policy
question
and
decided
it.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
your
honor,
it
has.
the
eeoc,
of
course,
is
not
authorized
to
issue
binding
regulations--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--but
it
does
issue
guidelines--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--and
it
did
issue
a
contemporaneous
guideline
in
1965
which
we
have
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
petitioners'
brief
at
page
4a.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
guideline
and
the
subsequent
opinion
letters
which
are
also
reprinted
in
the
appendix
make
it
very
clear
that
the
eeoc
at
that
time
felt
that
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
standard
was
incorporated.
the
position
of
the
eeoc
which
it's
arguing
in
its
amicus
brief
and
will
be
presenting
to
the
court
in
a
moment
is
clearly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
it
has
evidenced
it
in
later
opinion
letters.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
guideline
was
changed
in
1972
to
omit
the
language
that
makes
it
clear
that
the
equal
pay
standard
was
incorporated.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
and
both
before
and
after
that
'72
guideline
there
had
been
opinion
letters
issued
directly
contrary,
so
that
there's
no
question
but
what
there
has
been
a
complete
reversal
of
the
position,
and
of
course
the
petitioners
rely
upon
this
court's
analysis
in
general
electric
v.
gilbert
that
to
the
extent
that
the
opinions
and
the
guidelines
of
the
eeoc
are
entitled
to
deference,
it's
the
contemporaneous
opinions.
and
certainly
where
they
accord
with
the
express
legislative
intent,
that
should
have
the
controlling
effect.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
your
honor,
if
i
may
respond
to
that
by
one
word
of
introduction?
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
when
title
vii,
of
course,
was
before
congress
there
was
concern
expressed,
initially
by
others
and
finally
by
senator
bennett,
that
the
decision
reached
in
the
equal
pay
act
of
1963
might
be
abrogated
or
nullified
in
some
way
by
the
broad
sweep
of
title
vii,
at
the
time
that
sex
was
introduced
as
a
protected
classification.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
it
came
after
committee
hearings
had
ended
in
the
house,
while
there
was
debate
on
the
house
floor.
it
appeared
in
a
proposed
amendment
by
representative
smith
and
in
the
same
afternoon
was
adopted
with
limited
debate.
when
the
bill
went
to
the
senate
it
never
went
through
committee
hearing,
it
went
straight
to
the
senate
for
debate,
and
so
there
was
very
little
really
substantive
discussion
of
the
sex
amendment.
senator
clark
expressed
the
concern
of
others
that
by
so
doing...
and
since
the
coverage
of
title
vii
is
of
course,
as
we
have
mentioned,
broader
than
the
equal
pay
act.
it
covers
such
things
as
conditions
of
employment
and
access
to
jobs...
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
overreaching
the
equal
pay
act
and
of
reading
out
of
it
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
limitation.
and
so
senator
clark
responded
to
that
concern
by
his
understanding
of
the
doctrine
of
in
pari
materia
construction
which
was
simply
to
say
that
the
subsequent
enactment
would
not
have
that
effect.
there
was
nothing
in
title
vii
as
it
was
then
before
congress
that
expressly
said
that.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
senator
clark
must
necessarily
have
been
relying
on
in
pari
materia
construction.
however,
senator
bennett
apparently
was
not
comfortable
with
leaving
it
at
that,
and
so
introduced
an
amendment.
unfortunately
for
the
benefit
of
legislative
history,
that
amendment
came
after
cloture
had
been
invoked
on
the
senate
floor
so
that,
for
one
thing,
the
date
was
extremely
limited,
and
for
another,
it
was
styled
as
a
technical
amendment.
that
of
course
was
consistent
with
what
senator
bennett
was
doing,
which
was
clarifying,
not,
as
has
been
suggested
by
other
parties,
narrowing
the
scope
of
title
vii,
but
clarifying
what
congress
expected
to
be
the
narrow
scope.
the
bennett
amendment
refers
to
section
6(d)
which
was
the
equal
pay
act
amendment
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
it
states
in
essence
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
title
vii
to
differentiate
and
pay
on
the
basis
of
sex
if
it's
authorized
by
the
equal
pay
act.
there
have
been
three
interpretations
put
forth
for
what
the
bennett
amendment
means.
the
most
narrow
and
i
think
one
not
strongly
urged
by
any
party
as
this
time
is
that
all
it
did
was
incorporate
four
defenses
that
are
found
as
a
part
of
the
equal
pay
act.
the
reason
that
that
can
be
discounted
fairly
simply
is
that
those
four
defenses
already
existed
in
title
vii
as
it
was
proposed.
the
first
three
existed
in
a
sentence
immediately
preceding
the
insertion
of
the
bennett
amendment
in
section
703(h).
the
other
one,
any
other
factor
other
than
sex,
is
implicit
in
title
vii
itself,
which
only
creates
a
violation
for
discrimination
based
upon
sex.
the
second
interpretation,
and
the
one
that's
being
urged
by
the
eeoc,
is
that
they
recognized
that
certainly
senator
bennett
and
congress
intended
more
than
the
four
defenses.
they
refer
to
the
entire
equal
pay
act,
not
just
the
defenses.
and
so
they
say
that
what
he
meant
to
do
was
simply
say
that
anytime
an
equal
pay
claim
is
raised,
that
the
equal
work
standard
applies.
but
that
is
just
as
illogical,
taken
in
the
context
of
what
congress
had
just
finished
doing
the
year
prior...
and
i
would
point
out,
the
same
congress...
in
adopting
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--he
uses
the
word
"exception"
and
in
the
context
in
which
he
uses
it,
your
honor,
it's
not
clear
what
he
referred
to.
the
only
way
that
we
can
interpret
it
to
make
any
sense
is
that
he
intended
to
incorporate
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
standard,
all
of
section
6(d),
and
used
the
term
"exception".
it's
also
possible
that
what
he
meant
to
include
was
the
entire
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
would
include
the
narrow
employee
and
employer
exemptions.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
1965
clarification,
although
it
comes
later...
and
of
course
that
raises
some
questions--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--one
year
later.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
the
bennett
amendment
was
adopted
in
1964;
the
clarification
came
in
1965.
it's
entitled
to
weight.
it
attempts
to
show
why
the
amendment
came
in
the
limited
form
that
it
did,
because
of
the
cloture
situation.
it
comes
from
the
author
and
sponsor
of
the
amendment,
it
comes
relatively
contemporaneously,
it
was
agreed
to
by
senator
dirksen,
who
also
was
instrumental
in
the
adoption
of
title
vii.
and
a
bit
later,
several
weeks
later,
senator
clark,
who
took
exception
to
a
limited
portion
of
it,
namely
the
question
of
coverage,
agreed
with
the
essence
of
it,
which
was
the
incorporation
of
the
equal
pay
act.
so
three
of
the
pivotal
people--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--senator
humphrey
was
commenting
about
a
different
topic.
his
comments
were,
as
i
remember
them,
directed
at
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
standard.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
yes,
i
do.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
i
believe
that
it's
appropriate
to
view
the
bennett
amendment
as
a
technical
correction
because
it
was
a
clarifying
amendment.
it
was
not
a
narrowing
of
the
scope
of
title
vii
in
the
area
of
sex-based
wage
discrimination,
it
was
an
explanation
of
congress'
intent
and
expectation
that
title
vii
would
be
that
narrow.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
that
it
has
relevance
and
weight
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
to
the
contrary
that
that
was
not
the
sense
and
intent
of
congress
when
it
was
adopted.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
everything
in
the
record
is
consistent.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
your
honor,
that's
very
true,
and
it
certainly
goes
to
an
evaluation
of
the
weight
of
the
comments,
and
we
are
not
relying
solely
on
that
comment,
although
all
of
the
evaluative
criteria
that
the
court
has
mentioned
would
require
that
weight
be
given
to
it
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
not
attempt
in
the
time
that
i
have
to
address
all
of
the
comments
of
the
respondents
and
the
government
with
which
i
don't
agree.
i
believe
that
with
one
exception
those
have
all
been
covered
in
the
brief
and
i
would
ask
that
my
silence
not
be
taken
as
consent
to
them.
the
one
point,
however,
that
was
raised
goes
to
the
question
of
how
this
case
would
be
proven
if
it
was
returned
to
the
county.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
employer's
wage
scales
prior
to
the
time
of
collective
bargaining
were
set
by
the
studies
and
the
wages
that
were
produced
by
those
studies
were
the
ones
paid.
subsequent
to
the
time
of
collective
bargaining,
of
course,
they
were
set
by
bargaining
between
the
union
and
the
employer
rather
than
the
impression
created
by
the
respondent
that
they
were
manipulated
by
the
employer.
the
real
question,
however,
is
that
the
respondents
and
the
government
have
not
provided
the
answer
to
this
court
of
what
will
be
the
standard
to
determine
sex-based
wage
discrimination.
the
answer
is--
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
--a
cost-of-living
increase
for
the
males
only?
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
if
it
comes
within
one
of
the
other
protected
areas
of
title
vii,
it
obviously
is
a
violation.
if
it
is
a
matter
of
wage
discrimination
and
is
not
a
matter
in
which
there
can
be
found
a
comparison
job,
even
a
hypothetical
job,
which
will
be
the
case
in
almost
every
instance,
then
it
would
not
violate
title
vii
because
it
does
not
violate
the
equal
pay
act.
mr.
lawrence
r.
derr
that's
correct.
and
the
reason
that
we
take
that
position
and
the
reason
that
that
is
the
correct
position
is
not
necessarily
because
that
that's
the
policy
that
we
espouse
or
anyone
else
espouses,
but
congress,
congress
fully
considered
that
possibility
and
others,
it
looked
at
the
comparative
worth,
the
comparative
value,
and
it
decided
in
the
equal
pay
act
that
the
equal
pay
standard
was
the
one
to
apply.
