we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
county
of
washington
v.
gunther.
mr.
derr,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
that
was
a
finding
of
the
district
court,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
change
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
hewitt.
chief
justice
burger
did
you
make
a
proffer
of
what
you
were
going
to
prove?
chief
justice
burger
that's
usually
the
best
way
to
preserve
a
point
like
that,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
you
mean
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case?
not
a
presumption?
there's
no
presumption
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
burger
is
it
your
view
that
the
term
"comparable
work"
is
the
same
as
"equal
work"?
chief
justice
burger
i
got
the
impression
that
that
was
your
view
being
advanced
at
some
time
here.
you
think
that
they
do
not
mean
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
burger
well,
in
a
law
firm,
the
young
lawyers
do
work
that's
comparable
to
what
the
senior
partners
do,
but
they
don't
do
equal
work
and
they
surely
don't
get
equal
pay.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.

[recess.]

solicitor

time,
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
counsel?
you
have
about
two
minutes
remaining.

justice
