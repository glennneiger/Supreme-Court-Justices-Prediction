justice
stevens
is
it
true,
then,
mr.
derr,
that
the
problem
presented
by
this
case
only
affects
those
job
categories
that
are
bona
fide
gender-based
classifications?
because
if
you
have
a
history
of
passed
male
or
female
in
the
opposite
sex
category,
you
can
always
find
your
remedy
under
the
equal
pay
act,
if
i
understand
you?
so
that--
justice
stevens
--well,
the
problem
that
you're
addressing
in
this
case
is
one
in
which
there's
a
separate
female
category
of
jobs
and
a
separate
male
category
of
jobs,
entirely
separate,
and
then...
you
assume
it
won't
be
changed
in
the
future,
and
it's
always
been
that
way,
in
both
categories?
oh,
i
thought
you
said
there
was
access
to
the
higher
jobs?
justice
stevens
well,
at
least
the
category
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
exclusively
female
category?
no.
justice
stevens
yes.
let
me
just
ask
one
here.
assume
that,
instead
of
this
being
a
pay
case,
that
they
were
complaining
they
had
to
work
saturdays
instead
of...
and
the
corrections
officers
did
not,
or
they
had
to
work
till
6
o'clock
and
they
only
had
to
work
till
five,
something
like
that.
that
would
clearly
violate
title
vii,
wouldn't
it?
if
it's
anything
but
pay?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
they
said
they
get
paid
for
overtime
if
they're
male
but
they
don't
if
they're
female,
in
the
two
categories?
justice
stevens
only
under
equal
pay,
if
they
said
the
men
get
overtime
and
the
females
do
not?
that
would
not
violate
title
vii,
in
your
judgment?
justice
stevens
well,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
denied
payment
for
the
overtime?
if
the
males
are
paid
time
and
a
half
and
the
females
are
paid
straight
time
for
overtime?
that's
the
only
difference.
justice
stevens
and
so
there
would
be
no
recovery
under
title
vii?
and
they're
in
different
categories,
as
they
are
here.
so
you
have
no
right
under
the
wage
act,
under
my
hypothesis.
and
i'm
asking
you,
is
there
a
right
under
title
vii
in
that
hypothetical
case?
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
truck
driver-secretary
wouldn't
qualify
under
the
9th
circuit
opinion
either,
because
those
jobs
are
not
substantially
equal.
justice
stevens
that's
the
comparable,
is
it
not?
they
don't
use
the
comparable
standard.
they
definitely
disavow
it
in
the
supplemental
opinion.
justice
stevens
mr.
derr,
could
i
ask
you,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
your
legal
position,
what
about
their
hypothetical
about
a
cost-of-living
increase
for
the
male
category
but
no
such
increase
for
the
females?
justice
stevens
yes,
or
a
bonus
for
them
of,
say,
ten
percent
at
the
end
of
the
year?
justice
stevens
specifically,
in
this
case,
it
would
not
violate
either
statute?
