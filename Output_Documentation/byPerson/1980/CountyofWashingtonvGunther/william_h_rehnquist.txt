justice
rehnquist
mr.
derr,
one
thing
that
bothers
me
about
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
we
are
talking
about
kind
of
an
abstract
distinction
which
may
not
boil
down
to
too
much
when
it
comes
to
actual
application.
what
in
your
view
is
the
difference
between
equal
work
and
comparable
work?
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
derr,
do
you
think
the
9th
circuit
would
permit
a
40
hours
and
another
puts
in
40
hours,
and
therefore
we
have
to
decide
which
is
harder
work,
or
which
is
more
difficult
work,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
how?
i
presume
the
court
would
have
to
take
testimony,
and
make
its
own
decision
as
a
question
of
fact.
justice
rehnquist
it's
true,
isn't
it,
that
the
'65
comment
by
senator
bennett
was
never
heard
by
the
97
other
senators,
or
99
other
senators,
who
had
already
enacted
the
bill
into
law?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
mr.
derr--
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
hewitt,
in
a
case
where
the
employer
has
established
a
system
of
pay
and
set
a
certain
rate
for
secretaries
and
a
certain
rate
for
outside
salesmen
and
the
outside
salesmen's
rate
is
higher
or
at
any
rate
their
gross
income
is
higher,
do
you
think
that
could
be
attacked
under
title
vii?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
take
a
situation
which
i
think
has
arisen
in
connection
with
the
airlines
where
you
have
male
flight
attendants
and
female
stewardesses...
i
guess
they're
all
called
attendants
now.
and
that
group
brings
a
title
vii
action
on
the
grounds
or
an
equal
pay
action,
on
the
grounds
that
the
attendants,
although
they've
put
in
the
same
number
of
hours,
are
not
being
paid
the
same
amount
as
the
pilots.
do
you
think
that
a
court
can
then
evaluate
the
number
of
hours
and
the
training
and
the
capacity
and
ability
required
of
attendants
as
opposed
to
pilots?
justice
rehnquist
but
what
would
be
a
hypothetical
example?
this
one.
justice
rehnquist
yes.
this
case.
isn't
that
what
you
say?
justice
rehnquist
what
if
both
the
matrons'
guard
force
were
made
up
of
both
men
and
women
and
paid
equally,
and
the
deputy
sheriff
force
were
made
up
of
men
and
women,
and
paid
at
a
higher
rate,
but
paid
equally?
do
you
think
a
matron
or
a
guard,
a
male,
could
bring
a
challenge
to
that
sort
of
system?
justice
rehnquist
right.
are
you
saying
that
both
are
prima
facie?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
is
your
position
that
the
bennett
act...
rather,
that
the
equal
pay
act,
in
effect,
authorized
nothing?
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
response,
then,
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
that
was
already
in
the
act?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
provision
banning
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
in
title
vii
was
introduced
by
congressman
howard
smith
from
virginia?
justice
rehnquist
mr.
sullivan,
as
i
understand
mrs.
hewitt's
argument,
she
says
that
for
her
purposes
she
is
taking
the
scale,
wage
scale,
already
set
by
the
county
and
simply
seeking
to
show
that
there
has
been
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
under
title
vii
in
it;
and
that
that
would
not
require
the
courts
to
evaluate
the
relative
worth
of
the
flight
attendant's
job
versus
the
pilot's
job,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
is
that
your
submission
also,
or
do
you
think
that
courts
under
the
comparability
theory
can
evaluate
quite
widely
varying
jobs?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
we
don't
either?
how
are
we
supposed
to
write
the
opinion?
justice
rehnquist
but
is
that
what
this
court
ordinarily
does?
aren't
we
supposed
to
lay
down
rules
of
law
rather
than
simply
say,
go
back
and
develop
some
more
facts
and
then
we'll
tell
you
whether
you've
made
a
case
or
not?
