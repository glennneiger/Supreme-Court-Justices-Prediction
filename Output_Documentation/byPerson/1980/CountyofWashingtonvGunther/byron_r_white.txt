justice
white
and
the
claim
isn't
that
women
are
put
in
these
jobs,
and
men
put
in
these,
discriminatorily?
the
claim
is
just
on
the
pay?
justice
white
and
your
position
would
be
that
even
if
you
didn't
have
to
rely
on
inference
to
prove
intention,
even
if
they
had
the
employer
cold,
so
to
speak,
that
there
would
be
no
title
vii
liability?
justice
white
for
anything,
whether
intentional
or
not.
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
case
doesn't
get
off
the
ground
unless
the
jobs
are
identical?
justice
white
are
there
any?
justice
white
has
there
ever
been
one?
a
female
corrections
officer?
justice
white
that's
really
the
comparison
here,
isn't
it?
justice
white
then
there
have
been?
justice
white
but
this
would
be
a
perfectly
straight-forward
title
vii
case
if
there
were
no
access.
justice
white
has
the
eeoc
changed
its
position
on
the
matter?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
guidelines.
justice
white
then
how
has
it
evidenced
its
change
of
position
if
it
has?
justice
white
but
how
has
it
evidenced
it
other
than
filing
this
brief?
justice
white
has
it
changed
its
guideline?
justice
white
and
then
it
issued
some
opinion
letters
contrary
to
the
earlier
one?
justice
white
but
you
would
be
here
if
half
the
corrections
officers
were
women
and
half
men
if
your
claim
still
was
that
the
exclusively
female
category
was
paid
on
a
discriminatory
basis?
justice
white
and
how
much
you
have
to
prove
is
really
not
here,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
you
answered
me
a
while
ago
that
the
matron
could
certainly
make
out
a
case
on
that
basis,
if
you...
and
that
you
could
make
your
proffer
of
proof
and
make
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
white
but
the
matrons
in
my
brother
rehnquist's
example
would
have
as
strong
a
case
there
as
they
do
here,
if
they
exclusively?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
and
there
have
been,
or
are,
women
deputy
sheriffs?
justice
white
to
prove
intentional
sex
discrimination,
is
that
it?
justice
white
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
certainly
you
are
his
judgment.
justice
white
well,
didn't
we
limit
the
grant
in
this
case
to
just
the
one
question?
or,
isn't
there
just
one
question
involved,
whether
or
not
you
must
allege
and
prove
an
equal
pay
act
violation
in
order
to
prove
it
title
vii?
justice
white
that
is
the
issue,
and
if
we
decide
against
you
the
case
is
over,
if
we
disagree
with
your
version
of
the
bennett
amendment.
justice
white
but
if
we
agree
with
you
we
don't
reach
any
other
question,
do
we?
