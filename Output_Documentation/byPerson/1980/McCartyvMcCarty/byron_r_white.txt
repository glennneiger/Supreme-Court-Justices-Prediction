justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
talking

this...
i
don't
care
about
quasi-community
property,
i
want
to
talk
about
this
pension.
when
does
her
interest
rise
in
that
pension?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
she
doesn't
have
it
if
they're
not

two
people
married,
and

them
is
a
retired

and
they're
not
divorced,
they're
living
together.
and
he
assigns
his
retirement
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
when
her
interest
arises.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
she
has...
under
california
law
she
has
an
interest
enough
in
the
pension
payments
to
keep
him
from
assigning
the?
justice
byron
r.
white

from
encumbering
them?
or
from
their
being
attached?
