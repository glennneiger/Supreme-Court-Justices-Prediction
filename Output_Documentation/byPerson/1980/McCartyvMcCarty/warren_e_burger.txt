we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
mccarty
v.
mccarty.
mr.
eytan,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
california
law,
assume
hypothetically
that
he
had
been
a
physician
for
general
motors
or
du
pont
all
this
time
and
had
precisely
the
same
experience.
ultimately,
would
his
pension
be
subject
to
division
under
the
california
community
property
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me.
just
one
more
before
we
go
on
to
that.
then
you
implied
that
the
congress
had
established
this
elaborate
scheme
of
compensation,
which
in
part
was
to
draw
physicians
into
the
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
other
services
too,
but
we're
dealing
with
a
physician
here
now.
congress
certainly
must
not
be
unaware
that
most
physicians
coming
in
would
have
wives
accompanying
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
an
economic
matter,
laying
aside
your
statute--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--isn't
every
pension
a
form
of
deferred
compensation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
winter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
it's
an
inchoate
interest
until
there's
some
occasion
like
a
divorce
to
take
some
legal
action
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
eytan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
