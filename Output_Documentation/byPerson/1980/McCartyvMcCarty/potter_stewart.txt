mr.
winter,
in
addition
to
the
conventional
preemption
arguments,
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
brother
on
the
other
side
made
another
argument,
i.e.,
that
california
has
misconceived
what
the
nature
of
this
property;
that
instead
of
it
being
a
run-of-the-mill
pension
such
as
was
involved
in
hisquierdo
or
such
as
would
be
involved
in
a
general
electric
pension,
this
instead
of
being
deferred
compensation
for
present
services
on
active
duty
is
actually
compensation
for
more
limited
services
in
retirement.
and
if
that's
true,
then
it
wouldn't
even
be
the
kind
of
property
that's
subject
to
the
community
property
laws,
quasi-community
property
or
any
other
kind,
would
it?
justice
stewart
wait,
am
i
right
in
my
assumption?
justice
stewart
of
course
we
do.
we
always
have
to
be
that.
justice
stewart
well,
no,
assuming
that's
true,
i
said,
assuming
that's
true?
justice
stewart
that
what
it
is,
what
so-called
retirement
pay
is,
is
compensation
for
the
more
limited
services
for
which
he
is
liable
in
retirement,
and
rather
than
being
deferred
compensation
for
his
services
performed
during
active
duty.
justice
stewart
now,
assuming
that's
true?
justice
stewart
let's
not
argue
about
whether
or
not
it
is.
assuming
it's
true,
then
california
would
be
quite
mistaken
in
considering
this
property
covered
under
its
community
property
doctrines,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
their
subsequent
earnings?
justice
stewart
right.
justice
stewart
full
pay.
justice
stewart
we're
really
now
arguing
about
whether
or
not
it
is
true,
the
assumption,
aren't
we?
justice
stewart
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
stewart
you
mean
he
refused
to
retire?
not
to
resign?
justice
stewart
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
justice
stewart
that
question
isn't
involved
in
this
case?
