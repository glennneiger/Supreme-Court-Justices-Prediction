mr.
mattaniah
eytan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
richard
john
mccarty,
the
husband
in
a
california
divorce
action,
appeals
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal,
first
appellate
district;
which
we've
had
affirmed
a
superior
court
determination
that
the
husband's
expectancy
in
receiving
army
retired
pay
should
be
awarded
in
part
to
his
ex-spouse.
the
court
of
appeal
took
the
position
that
the
superior
court
had
properly
applied
california
law...
and
that's
a
crucial
matter
in
this
entire
case...
and
that
having
applied
california
law
the
expectancy
in
retired
pay
was
indivisible
and
then
divided
the
army
retired
pay
pursuant
to
established
california
formula.
the
husband
contended
then
and
contends
now
that
federal
law
prohibits
such
a
result,
and
federal
law
not
only
applies
but
preempts
california
from
making
such
a
determination.
the
facts
in
the
case
can
very
briefly
be
summarized.
the
parties
were
married
in
oregon
in
1957
and
were
divorced
in
california,
or
at
least
they
were
separated
in
california,
in
1976.
when
the
parties
were
married
the
husband
was
in
medical
school
in
oregon.
he
was
a
domiciliary
of
oregon,
as
was
his
wife.
in
his
fourth
year
of
medical
school,
the
husband
joined
the
army
and
remained
in
the
army
for
the
entire
period
up
until
the
divorce.
after
spending
one
year
in
oregon
he
was
transferred
by
the
military
to
pennsylvania,
the
district
of
columbia,
texas,
hawaii,
california,
staying
in
each
place
for
a
number
of
years.
before
the
superior
court
the
husband
contended
that
he
was
an
oregon
domiciliary
and
that
california
could
not
apply
its
quasi-community
property
regime,
which
is
encompassed
in
section
4803
of
the
california
civil
code.
that's
a
somewhat
unusual
provision
which
provides
that
property
which
is
acquired
by
either
party
to
a
marriage
while
domiciled
outside
of
california
shall
be
treated
as
community
property
if
the
party
would
have
been
domiciled
in
california
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
once
property
is
classified
as
quasi-community
property,
it
then
is
treated
as
community
property.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
distinctive
to
community
property
matters.
the
issue
comes
up
in
a
wide
variety
of
contexts
whenever
a
community
property
state
or
another
state
that
under
equitable
division
of
property,
in
the
context
of
a
divorce
seeks
to
divide
army
retired
pay.
now
there
is
a
threshold
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case,
and
by
explaining
what
happened
before
the
lower
courts
i
can
deal
with
that
as
a
preliminary
matter.
before
the
superior
court
the
husband
submitted
the
decision
in
hisquierdo
v.
hisquierdo
of
the
california
court
of
appeals.
that
decision
was
not
terribly
dissimilar
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
same
case,
which
came
out
sometime
later.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes.
what
makes
this
case
so
distinctive
is
that
the
california
court
here
improperly
assumes
that
california
law
applies
of
its
own
force.
in
your
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
should
be
no
question
that
california
law
has
everything
to
say
and
federal
law
has
nothing
to
say
about
the
matter.
federal
law
tells
us
nothing
about
the
pension
rights
of
someone
who
works
for
general
motors.
what
we
have
here,
however,
is
a
very
major
federal
interest.
we
have
here
the
exercise
by
the
congress
of
elaborate
legislation
pursuant
to
congressional
war
power
authorities
to
raise
and
support
armies.
article
i,
section
8,
clause
12.
the
congress
has
passed
legislation
which
covers
in
great
detail
all
elements
of
army
pay,
army
retired
pay,
various
annuity
programs,
and
the
like.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
no,
i
would
not
so
contend.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
well,
i
would
argue,
of
course,
that
the
future
element
of
it
is
very
significant,
but
of
course
my
argument
goes
way
beyond
that.
and
if
i
can
move
then
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
main
part
of
the
argument
it
will
more
fully
answer
your
question.
unlike--
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
--yes.
and
others.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes,
congress
has
directed
its
attention
specifically
on
several
occasions
to
the
question,
how
to
deal
with
the
needs
of
wives.
it
has
done
so
on
three
occasions
which
resulted
in
legislation.
in
1957
congress
addressed
this
problem
and
decided
that
army
personnel
should
be
put
under
social
security.
until
then
they
weren't,
and
of
course
the
federal
civil
service
and
foreign
service
are
not.
so
that
since
1957
army
personnel
have
been
subsumed
under
social
security
in
the
way
that
when
the
army
man
gets
his
paycheck,
there's
a
subtraction
for
social
security
and
if
the
wife
never
works
a
day
in
her
life
and
never
accumulates
any
credits
whatever
toward
social
security
benefits
in
her
own
right,
she
collects
benefits,
the
ex-wife
collects
benefits--
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
--oh,
no,
under
social
security
she
collects
the
same
benefits
as
the
spouse.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
if
i
may
respectfully
dissent.
when
he
reaches
the
appropriate
age
there
is
a
benefit
to
his
spouse.
he
doesn't
have
to
die
for
his
spouse
to
get
a
benefit,
nor
does
he
have
to
die
for
his
ex-spouse
to
get
a
benefit.
the
only
requirement
in
that
regard
is
that
they
must
have
been
married
for
ten
years.
in
addition,
there
are
separate
benefits,
of
course,
for
the
widow.
and
with
respect
to
social
security
widow's
benefits
there
is
an
offset
configuration
which
applies
to
other
programs
that
operate
in
conjunction
with
social
security
and
those
are
the
annuity
programs
that
i
believe
you
had
in
mind.
there
are
annuity
programs.
there
is
also
social
security
for
the
widow,
and
there's
a
combination,
and
at
the
top
level
if
the
widow
gets
the
maximum
amount
of
the
annuity,
she
doesn't
get
social
security
by
an
offset
and
she
doesn't
get
the
maximum
amount
of
the
annuity
she
gets
from
social
security.
but
interestingly,
there's
no
offset
as
against
the
ex-spouse
at
all.
the
offset
is
only
as
against
the
widow.
and
the
annuity
program,
you're
correct,
is
only
to
the
widow.
social
security
is
not.
now,
the
main
point
in
all
this,
if
one
can
cut
through
the
heart,
is
that
obviously
california
law
cannot
apply
of
its
own
force
and
effect.
this
is
a
program
established
by
congress.
this
is
a
federal
entitlement.
there
are
very
important
considerations
both
to
the
national
program
involved.
there
are
very
practical,
direct
consequences,
and
as
hisquierdo
taught
us
and
perhaps,
more
importantly,
as
we
know
from
clearfield
trust
and
its
multiple
progeny,
that
where
important
federal
programs,
important
interests
of
the
federal
government
are
implicated,
are
involved,
we
look
to
federal
law.
now
what
does
federal
law
tell
us
in
this
case?
if
we
had
a
civil
service
situation
here,
if
we
had
a
civil
service
husband,
we
would
have
direct
federal
law
telling
us
what
to
do
because
the
congress
has
in
title
v,
section
8345(j)(1)
told
us
that
you
defer
to
the
states
and
whatever
the
state
rule
is,
you
apply
it.
the
same
thing
is
now
true
for
the
foreign
service.
but
the
congress
has
not
done
that
for
the
military.
they
have
not
passed
a
direct
statement
of
their
intention
as
to
what
federal
law
ought
to
apply
and
i
would
submit
to
you,
the
husband
would
submit
to
you,
that
the
formula
that
the
congress
has
adopted
for
civil
service
cannot
apply
to
the
military,
and
i
don't
think
i'm
overreaching
by
saying
i
don't
see
how
the
congress
could
pass
such
a
law.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
husband's
status
as
a
retired
army
man
doesn't
mean
that
he's
resigned
his
commission.
an
army
man
who
retires
remains
a
commissioned
officer
in
the
army.
the
consequences
of
that
is
that
he's
subject
to
the
code
of
military
justice
forever.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes,
but
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
mr.
justice,
is
that
congress
could
not...
i
don't
believe
it
could...
i
am
making
the
argument
to
you
that
it
could
not
pass
the
same
kind
of
a
formula
enactment
as
it
did
to
the
civil
service
because
the
consequences
for
the
army,
for
the
army
retirees,
would
be
far
different
than
for
civil
servants--
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
--oh,
of
course,
it
has
the
power
to
do
anything
it
wants.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
it
could
not
follow
that
same
formula.
let
me
show
you
why.
we
know
that
an
army
retiree
remains
subject
to
recall
at
any
time,
and
any
time
means
any
time.
it
doesn't
mean
national
emergency,
it
doesn't
mean
war,
it
means
any
time
that
the
secretary
of
the
service
says
so.
and
apropos
of
that,
on
december
12,
1980,
the
congress
reaffirmed
this
insistence
that
the
army
retiree
can
be
called
up
at
any
time.
i've
mentioned
in
the
reply
brief
that
there
is
new
legislation,
so
we're
not
talking
about
any
"porey"
scheme
going
back
a
long
time
or
some
disused
statute.
now,
at
any
time
means
that
despite
the
fact
that
we
have
an
all-volunteer
army
today,
as
to
the
army
retiree
the
impact
of
this
statute
is
conscriptive.
he
has
to
go,
and
the
reason
he
has
to
go
is
because
he
is
still
an
officer
in
the
army.
if
the
congress
now
were
to
pass
a
law--
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
--yes.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes.
now,
the
reason
he
loses
his
retired
pay
is
because
retired
pay
is
not
pay
for,
it's
not
deferred
payment
for
past
services.
the
federal
rule,
enunciated
in
some
16
cases
which
i
call
to
the
court's
attention,
including
five
opinions
of
this
court,
is
that
retired
pay
is
current
pay.
it's
reduced
pay
for
reduced
services.
and
that's
really
the
whole
point,
what
did
california
do?
what
does
california
always
do?
it
said
that
whatever
the
retirement
benefits
are,
those
are
deferred
payments
for
past
services;
and
once
it
makes
that
decision,
it
treats
army
pay
the
way
it
does
the
general
motors
official.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
certainly
it
can,
and
congress
has
permitted
that
in
express
terms.
what
the
congress
did
in
that
regard
was
really
quite
drastic,
because
in
1975
the
congress
changed
the
whole
scheme
of
things.
and
had
you
asked
me
the
question,
what
could
the
wife
have
done
prior
to
1975,
i
would
have
said
that
the
wife
would
have
a
very
tough
time
enforcing
any
california
support
order.
but,
look,
in
1975
the
congress
said
that
when
it
comes
to
support,
any
kind
of
support...
and
there's
a
long
list
in
the
statute;
i'm
talking
about
title
42
of
the
code,
section
659(a)
and
especially
section
662(c).
what
the
congress
said
there
was
that
when
it
comes
to
support
payments,
the
wife
armed
with
a
state
court
award
may
proceed
to
garnishee
the
funds
directly
from
the
financial
officer
of
the
appropriate
federal
agency.
and
ever
since
then
we've
had
wives
from
california
and
elsewhere
doing
just
that,
and
elaborate
regulations
implementing
that
statute
have
now
been
published.
so
that
matter
has
been
taken
care
of
by
congress
in
the
very
limited
area
of
support.
and
what
the
congress
did,
just
so
that
no
one
could
mistake
it,
it
distinguished
carefully
between
support
and
property
interest.
it
stated
in
section
662(c)
of
that
legislation
that
when
we
say
support,
we
mean
alimony,
alimony
pendente
lite
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
child
support
payments,
but
we
don't
mean
community
property
awards,
we
don't
mean
property
divisions
pursuant
to
the
decrees
of
state
courts
that
have
equitable
division;
a
very
careful
distinction.
so
that,
as
we
look
at
what
the
congress
did
in
1975
you
see
that
there
as
well
as
in
social
security
amendments
it
had
the
spousal
interest
in
mind.
hisquierdo
put
it
this
way:
when
the
congress
provided
for
a
spousal
award
for
the
railroad
retiree,
it
had
something
like
a
community
concept
in
mind.
indeed,
i
may
point
out
a
third
instance
where
the
congress
had
support,
and
only
support,
in
mind.
there
is
legislation
that
says
that
the
army
man
may
make
an
allotment.
again,
for
support
purposes.
everything
deals
with
support,
not
property.
and
what
is
the
distinction?
we're
talking
here
about
property
rights,
property
rights
that
have
no
connection
whatever
with
need.
my
opponent
essentially
makes
the
argument,
as
do
the
amicus
briefs,
that
spouses,
ex-spouses
have
great
need.
their
social
security
payments
may
come
late,
they
have
to
wait
a
long
time.
they
need
more;
they
get
the
runaround,
or
whatever.
but
that's
a
question
of
need,
again,
that's
a
question
of
support.
the
congress
has
directed
its
attention
to
that
several
times
and
it's
come
out
with
a
formula.
that
formula
now
gives
the
spouse
more
than
she
ever
had,
because
the
congress
went
so
far
as
to
allow
the
united
states
to
be
sued
directly.
but
let
me
come
again
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
control
issue.
this
case
is
much
simpler
than
hisquierdo
ever
was,
because
in
this
case
if
we
apply
federal
law
as
the
california
courts
should
have,
the
california
courts
should
have
stated
that
under
federal
law
army
retired
pay
is
current
wages,
reduced
current
wages
for
reduced
services.
if
that
is
so,
the
whole
conceptual
underpinning
for
the
community
property
position
evaporates,
it
doesn't
exist.
now,
what
does
the
california
court
do?
it
stubbornly
applies
california
law
in
the
sense
that
it
says,
let
us
see
whether
there
is
any
express
statement
by
congress
that
bars
us
from
first
characterizing
the
property
and
then
dividing
it
and
deciding
to
do
anything
we
want
to
do
with
respect
to
that
property.
now,
that's
not
the
right
rule.
the
right
rule
has
to
be,
what
does
federal
law
tell
us
that
the
appropriate
rule
should
be?
i
would
concede
that
the
federal
rule
might
well
be
that
courts
should
defer
to
state
law.
that
might
be
the
correct
rule,
but
that
would
then
be
a
federal
rule.
in
our
case
the
federal
rule
is
clear
beyond
peradventure,
because
we
had
this
court
speaking
five
times
and
for
a
hundred
years.
the
first
decision
on
this
was
in
1881,
and
it
stated
very
clearly
that
an
army
man
who
was
retired
still
wears
the
uniform,
is
still
subject
to
the
code,
the
code
of
military
justice.
he
gets
his
pay
for
staying
in
the
service
and
jumping
to
attention
and
going
back
into
the
service
when
he's
directed.
now,
if
the
california
court
had
done
that,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter.
and
i
wouldn't
be
here
talking
about
the
anti-assignment
statute,
the
social
security
act
amendments,
the
spousal
awards,
and
all
that.
what
the
california
court
does,
however,
is
it
ignores
the
federal
law,
it
gives
it
the
back
of
the
hand.
there
is
not
a
single
intelligent
analysis
in
any
community
property
state
as
to
the
large
body
of
federal
law
that
says,
look,
this
is
not
deferred
compensation
for
past
services;
this
is
compensation
for
your
staying
eligible
for
recall.
it's
your
compensation
for
doing
all
kinds
of
other
things,
which
are
set
out
in
the
brief.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes?
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
i
of
course
would
agree
with
you
for
those
pensions
which
do
not
require
current
services
and
most
important
those
which
do
not
have
current
liabilities.
your
question
can't
be
answered
uniformly
for
the
military
retiree
because
the
congress
has
spoken
to
that
point,
and
this
court
has
spoken,
and
the
court
of
claims
has
spoken.
there
is
no
authority
to
the
contrary.
and
if
it
were
so
that
i
could
agree
with
you
for
army
retired
pay,
then
and
only
then
would
we
come
to
the
question
whether,
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
pension,
aren't
there
other
economic
considerations?
aren't
there
considerations
concerning
the
operation
of
the
army?
those
are
set
out
in
the
briefs
at
length.
doesn't
the
community
property
division
or
any
equitable
division
really
substantially
disrupt
the
army?
and
of
course,
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes.
mr
justice
stevens,
the
wife
can
compel
the
husband
to
pay
her
damages
in
the
event
he
refuses
to
resign.
in
the
very
recent
case
that
my
opponent
mentioned,
a
case
that
did
not
plough
new
ground
at
all,
we
had
an
air
force
husband,
luciano
v.
luciano,
a
1980
case,
where
the
air
force
husband
refused
to
resign
from
the
air
force
and
the
wife
claimed
that
she
had
the
right
to
collect
her
property
interest
in
his
retired
pay
and
never
mind
whether
he
wished
to
actually
start
retired
pay
coming.
he
refused
to
resign.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
yes,
i'm
sorry;
retire.
thank
you
for
the
correction.
the
court
held
that
she
could
declare
when
her
portion
of
the
retirement--
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
that's
correct.
the
california
court
determined
that
it
was
up
to
her
to
decide
when
the
retired
pay
would
come,
and
that
idea
was
further
amplified
in
a
more
recent
case
cited
in
my
reply
brief,
that
said
that
the
husband
who
refuses
to
retire
so
as
to
trigger
the
retirement
benefits
has
to
pay
damages
to
the
wife
in
an
amount
equal
to
what
she
would
have
gotten
as
her
property
interest
had
she
retired.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
not
at
all.
it's
a
property
interest.
it's
not
like
alimony
at
all.
it's
damages
for
someone
converting
your
property,
someone
depriving
you
of
your
property.
california
has
had
this
doctrine
a
very
long
time,
and
it's
fundamentally
based
upon
the
notion
that
if
you
have
something
within
your
control,
you
can
trigger
a
set
of
consequences
or
not.
and
if
you
choose
not
to
trigger
them,
then
the
person
who
suffers
thereby
is
entitled
to
damages
from
you.
the
wife
in
this
case,
may
i
point
out,
is
getting
alimony.
she
wants
half
the
retired
pay.
she's
getting
alimony.
the
husband
has
custody
of
the
three
minor
children,
the
husband
pays
everything,
she's
getting
her
alimony
based
upon
a
court
determination
of
her
need.
this
case
is
not
about
needs,
and
if
she
has
greater
need
at
any
time,
she
can
always
go
back
to
the
courts
and
get
more
alimony
if
she
can
sustain
her
burden
of
proof
on
that.
mr.
mattaniah
eytan
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
she
has
the
right
to
do
so
and
if
she
can
show
need,
the
answer
is,
yes.
but
imagine
this.
suppose
she
gets
the
money
and
then
she
decides
to
pledge
it
to
a
financial
institution
or
suppose
she
decides
to
give
it
to
her
second
husband
if
there
is
one,
never
mind
the
specific
fact
here.
the
point
is
that
once
you
get
into
the
property
business
you
allow
the
states
to
determine
that
the
wives
can
dispose
of
it
by
testamentary
disposition.
she
could
pledge
it.
strangers
start
getting
the
money.
look,
you
have
a
new
case
here,
in
re
miller,
as
to
which
cert
is
pending.
the
miller
court
from
montana
decided
that
the
wife
has
such
a
marvelous
property
interest
in
this
that
she
can
give
this
to
any
person
she
wants
by
testamentary
disposition.
does
anyone
really
believe
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
army
retiree,
perhaps
languishing
in
a
nursing
home,
is
going
to
share
his
retired
pay
with
a
second
husband
who
secured
it
by
testamentary
disposition?
has
anyone
really
considered
that
the
army
intended
for
army
retired
pay
to
be
so
abused
as
a
property
interest
that
husbands
who
have
their
retired
pay
taken
away
from
them
in
substantial
portions
have
to
seek
out
bankruptcy
relief?
that's
exactly
what's
been
happening.
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
reply
memorandum
you'll
see
the
cases
cited
there.
most
importantly,
i
think
that
the
statement
that
there's
no
anti-assignment
statute
here
a
la
hisquierdo
is
rot.
there
clearly
is
an
anti-assignment
statute.
it
goes
back
to
the
days
before
california
entered
the
union.
the
exact
text
has
changed
from
time
to
time
but
the
essential
point
is
the
same.
there
is
as
good
an
anti-assignment
statute
here,
as
in
hisquierdo,
and
when
you
consider
that
it's
the
united
states
government
that
has
all
the
benefits
in
this
area,
the
pay,
the
retired
pay,
the
social
security,
the
annuity
programs,
obviously
an
anti-assignment
statute
in
these
circumstances
for
army
pay
which
the
congress
protected
as
much
as
it
protected
regular
pay...
it's
all
in
the
same
statute...
cannot
mean
that
someone
can
take
active
duty
pay,
retired
pay,
because
of
state
law.
federal
law
applies
here.
federal
law
is
very
clear;
the
wife
has
no
interest.
