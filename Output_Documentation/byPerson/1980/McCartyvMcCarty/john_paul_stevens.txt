mr.
eytan,
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
eytan?
supposing
the
retiree
resigns
his
commission,
does
he
lose
his
pension?
justice
stevens
he
does
lose
his
pension.
he
loses...
well,
may
i
correct
you
and
call
it
retired
pay?
he
loses
his
retirement
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
winter,
i
don't
really
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
their
position.
their
position,
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
congress
has
said
that
the
pension
or
the
retirement
pay
should
belong
to
the
retired
officer
to
the
same
extent
in
every
state
in
the
united
states.
you're
saying
that
there's
a
different
rule
in
community
property
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
winter,
do
you
agree
with
what
your
opponent
said,
in
the
event
the
doctor
had
not
merely
retired
but
had
resigned
his
commission,
would
he
not
then
have
forfeited
any
right
to
the
retirement
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
not
agree
that
he
has
the
sole
discretion
as
to
whether
to
do
that,
and
the
wife
cannot
veto
that
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
just...
if
your
opponent's
conception
of
the
scheme
is
the
correct
one,
it's
not
merely
giving
something
up,
he
also
gets
something
when
he
resigns,
namely,
he
is
no
longer
exposed
to
the
risk
of
being
called
into
active
duty
and
running
the
risk
of
the
danger
that's
associated
with
a
military
life.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
this
goes
to
the
question
whether
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
pension
or
it's
in
the
nature
of
reduced
pay
for
a
limited
type
of
service,
namely,
availability
to
recall.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
are
a
number
of
officers
who
do
resign
for
that
very
reason.
