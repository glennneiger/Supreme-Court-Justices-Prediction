mr.
walter
t.
winter
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
for
one
moment
while
i
read
to
you
one
short
sentence
quoting
mr.
justice
gardner,
from
the
case
of
in
re
marriage
of
brantner,
when
he
said,--
"a
woman
is
not
a
breeding
cow
to
be
nurtured
during
her
years
of
fecundity,
then
conveniently
and
economically
converted
to
cheap
steaks
when
past
her
prime.
"
i
think
nothing
is
more
appropriate
than
this
particular
phrase,
when
we
are
talking
about
the
plight
of
the
military
wife,
because
the
military
wife's
situation
is
unique.
unlike
her
sisters
who
are
not
military
wives,
she
not
only
is
supposed
to
be
the
companion,
the
homemaker,
to
bear
and
raise
children,
but
the
military
wife
has
a
very
unique
position
in
the
military.
from
the
moment
that
she
marries
a
military
man,
she
becomes
part
of
the
military
as
much
as
if
she
herself
were
wearing
that
uniform.
she
assumes
the
role
of
her
husband.
if
her
husband
is
a
lieutenant,
she
is
the
wife
of
a
lieutenant.
she
for
all
intents
and
purposes
has
to
be
subservient
to
the
wife
of
the
colonel.
and
so
it
goes.
this
is
a
very--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--pardon
me?
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes,
i
think
it
is,
it
is
very
definitely
so.
but
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
do
at
the
present
time,
mr.
justice,
is
we
have
to
recognize
the
fact
that
these
women
do
serve
and
they
are
expected
to
serve,
they
are
expected
to
participate
in
social
functions.
they
are
even
given
guides,
"how
to
be
a
good
military
wife.
"
they
are
left
alone
for
months
at
a
time;
they
lead
nomadic
lives;
their
moves
are
approximately
two
years
apart,
and
this
is
extremely
important.
so
they
cannot
develop
their
own
careers,
they
cannot
develop
their
own
potential.
they
are
required
to
stabilize
the
children,
because
i
think
we
all
know
and
recognize
that
the
children
of
military
families
do
have
peculiar
problems,
they
cannot
have
any
continuity.
so
this
is
part
of
their
function
again.
and
they
cannot
fulfill,
justices,
the
american
dream
of
owning
a
home,
their
own
home,
because
for
all
intents
and
purposes
when
you
have
to
get
up
and
move
every
couple
of
years,
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
fact
that
their
incomes
are
extremely
low,
they
simply
do
not
have
the
time
or
the
opportunity
to
purchase
a
home.
they
have
a
lower
standard
of
living.
for
example,
dr.
mccarty,
who
was
a
board-certified
cardiologist,
had
an
income
of
$2,596.51
a
month,
$30,000
a
year.
and
i
think
we
all
know
that
cardiologists
can
earn
upwards
of
$150,000
a
year.
these
people
are
giving
up
something
for
the
future.
they
are
working
today
for
the
future.
you
may
recall...
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
after
almost
20
years
of
marriage,
what
did
dr.
and
mrs.
mccarty
actually
accumulate?
$13,000
in
assets.
two
automobiles,
$200
in
the
bank,
and
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
that
somebody
owed
to
them.
that
is
what
they
acquired
after
almost
twenty
years
of
marriage.
why
do
people
do
this?
why?
well,
patriotism,
perhaps.
but
actually
i
think
we
all
know
why
they
do
it.
they're
in
the
military
because
they
know
that
from
the
moment
that
they
start,
twenty
years
later
they
are
going
to
have
an
income
for
life.
this
is
the
true
asset
of
the
marriage.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
possibly
ignore
that.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
no,
i
don't
think
they're
stupid.
perhaps
they
don't
want
to
put
up
with
it,
mr.
justice,
and
that's
precisely--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--pardon
me?
mr.
walter
t.
winter
i
think
that
anyone
who
goes
into
the
service
and
stays
in
the
service,
mr.
justice,
stays
in
it
because
they
anticipate
that
retirement.
and
that's
something
they
all
talk
about.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
pardon
me?
mr.
walter
t.
winter
well,
mr.
justice,
it
has
everything
to
do
with
this
case
simply
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
supremacy
requirement.
now,
i
might
add,
if
i
may,
just,
mr.
justice,
that
in
the
first
place,
there's
a
big
question
of
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
your
honor,
i'd
be
delighted
if
you
would
take
judicial
notice--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--yes,
sir.
i
really
do.
and
if
i
may
just
point
this
out
to
you,
there
are
two
requirements
of
supremacy.
and
you
see,
this
is
not
their
entire
argument.
in
the
first
place,
they
never
actually
raised
the
statute
at
the
time
that
we
were
in
court
previously.
the
first
time
that
the
appellant
here
raised
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
was
when
he
filed
this
particular
brief.
he
never
mentioned
it
before.
however,
let's
forget
that
for
just
a
moment.
let's
treat
this
as
if
this
were
a
sur
petition.
we
then
get
involved
in
the
supremacy
requirement,
because
after
all,
the
only
question
here
is,
has
the
federal
scheme
actually
mandated
that
the
state
courts
can
no
longer
act
over
pensions?
and
there
are
two
requirements,
mr.
justice.
one
of
them
is,
there
must
be
an
actual
conflict
or
unambiguous
mandate.
now,
we
don't
have
that
here,
because
there
is
no
conflict
at
all.
it
is
not
even
mentioned
in
any
of
the
federal
statutes,
and
there
has
to
be
some
interference
with
a
federal
interest.
and
mr.
justice,
this
is
precisely
why
i
think
it's
very
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that,
because,
you
see,
they
keep
on
saying
that
this
country
is
going
to
fall
apart
if
the
ladies,
or
the
wives,
or
the
spouses
are
able
to
obtain
their
portion
of
the
pension.
and
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
justice,
that
it's
exactly
the
opposite
way
around.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
i
will
address
myself
to
the
other
eight
justices
then,
if
i
may.
one
of
the
points
that
is
made
and
that
is
so
often
made
in
this
particular
case
by
the
appellant
is
the
fact
that
the
military
would
allegedly
fall
apart,
fall
apart,
the
moment
that
we
give
the
wives
their
share
of
the
retirement.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
two
things,
there
are
two
portions
to
your
questions,
if
i
may
address
it.
in
the
first
place,
insofar
as
what
they
have
said,
i
believe
that
it
is
their
statement
that
they
are
talking
about
preemption,
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
has
not
been
a
preemption
because
the
congress
has
not
spoken
about
it
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
insofar
as
the
second
portion
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
if
the
congress
wished
to
speak
on
that
subject
and
wished
to
have
a
separate
rule
for
military
divorces,
then
congress
can
certainly
do
that.
there
is
absolutely
no
constitutional
prohibition
saying
that
they
may
not
have
a
federal
divorce
law.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
justice,
that
there
is
no
federal
divorce
law.
now--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--very
easily,
mr.
justice.
one
of
the...
in
the
first
place,
hisquierdo
had
some
very,
very
specific
wording
in
that
particular
statute.
they
talk
about,
for
example,
that
there
not,
be
not
any
assignment.
and
in
the
present
case,
and
in
the
military
retirement
cases,
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
there
can
be
an
assignment
of
an
officer's
wages.
the
hisquierdo
statute
talks
about
the
fact
that
it
is
not
subject
to
attachment.
and
in
the
present
case
there
is
a
specific
provision
for
attachment
in
the
case
of
support,
and
congress
has
in
fact
aided
the
wife
in
that
regard.
third,
in
the
hisquierdo
case
they
talk
about
the
legal
process
not
being
mentioned
in
the
statute.
in
other
words,
it
is
actually
by
case
law
only
that
we're
talking
about
legal
process
and,
as
far
as
we're
concerned
here...
in
hisquierdo
it
is
not
subject
to
legal
process,
but
in
the
present
type
of
a
situation
the
legal
process
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
statute.
so
that,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
hisquierdo
is
easily
differentiated.
and
another
thing,
sir,
is
about
anticipation
of
payments,
again
in
hisquierdo.
and
again
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
military
situation
at
all.
so
hisquierdo
is
a
very,
very
tightly
knit
scheme
which
i
believe
is
restricted
solely
to
the
retirement
scheme,
the
retirement
benefits,
and
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
a
military
retirement.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
that
depends
upon
where
they
come
from,
mr.
justice.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
in
california,
in
the
event
that
the
soldier
comes
to
the
state
of
california,
our
law
with
reference
to
quasi-community
property
would
only
arise
if
there
were
two
very,
very
distinct
requirements.
one,
both
have
to
be
domiciled
in
the
state
of
california,
so
the
mere
fact
that
you
come
into
the
state
of
california
does
not
in
any
way
transmute
this
interest--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--they
have
to
do
more
than
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
that's
part
of
it,
yes.
that
is
a
secondary
part--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--under
quasi-community
property,
we
have
to
differentiate--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--the
interest
arises
if
they
are
california
residents
or
domiciliaries...
pardon
me,
and
if
it...
then,
well,
if
they
start
out
in
california
and
he
earns
it
in
california
and
they
start
out
there
and
they
stay
there
and
get
a
divorce
there,
she's
had
this
interest
all
along.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
oh,
yes,
she
does;
she
does
unless
it
is
under
the
quasi-community
property
scheme.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
only
if
it
is
under
the
quasi-community
property.
if
they
are
residents
or...
pardon
me...
domiciliaries
of
another
state,
if
they
are
domiciliaries
of
another
state,
then
what
happens
is
that
as
far
as
california
is
concerned,
california
will
not
touch
that
retirement
because
the
laws
of
that
particular
state
apply,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
well,
again,
the
question
then
is--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--he
can't
do
that
under
california
law,
mr.
justice.
he
cannot
do
that
because
the
wife
owns
half
of
it.
you
see,
this
is
the
part--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--this
is
part
of...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
walter
t.
winter
her
interest
arises
as
they
earn
it
because
under
the
community
property
scheme
the
husband
and
wife
are
working
together.
our
california
courts
recognize
the
fact
that
the
husband,
when
he
works,
actually
does
not
contribute
any
more
to
the
benefit
of
the
couple's
life
together,
the
community,
as
it
were,
than
the
wife
who's
home
raising
the
children.
and
that's
why
this
is
so
important.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
she
does.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
that
is
so
inasmuch...
and
this
is
only,
now,
this
is
only
in
the
situation
where
we
have
a
community
property
situation.
if
it
is
quasi-community
property,
it's
a
completely
different
situation
because
by
the
mere
fact
of
entering
into
the
state
of
california,
this
in
and
of
itself
does
not
change
the
property
interest,
but
as
far
as
california
is
concerned,
when
you
both
worked
for
it,
you're
both
entitled
to
it.
it's
a
property
interest,
mr.
justice.
now,
of
course,
under
quasi-community
property
we
have
a
different
situation
because
under
quasi-community
property
they
both
must
be
domiciled
there
and,
of
course,
it
has
to
be
in
a
divorce
situation
only.
in
other
words,
again
even
though
they
both
become
domiciliaries,
if
they
then
leave
the
state
of
california,
california
has
no
interest
in
it
anymore.
and
so
i
believe
that
it's
very
important
for
us
to
differentiate
in
this
type
of
a
situation.
and
i
think
it
is
still
very
important
for
us
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
wife
is
an
equal
partner
and
should
be
considered
an
equal
partner
in
this
very
important
property
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
very
short
statement
to
this
court
at
this
time,
because
yesterday
when
i
came
here
to
washington
i
visited
arlington
cemetery.
and
i
could
not
help
but
think
of
the
millions
of
our
brave
fighting
men
who
sacrificed
so
much,
and
also
the
millions
of
brave
and
patient
women
that
they
left
behind,
women
who
spent
their
lonely
and
fearful
days
and
nights
waiting
and
praying
for
their
men
to
return
home.
these
women
provided,
justices,
for
their
men's
homes,
reared
their
men's
children,
and
most
important,
gave
their
men
the
courage
and
hope,
something
to
come
home,
something
to
fight
for.
we
have
never
turned
our
back
on
our
fighting
men.
and
i
ask
you
at
this
time,
let
us
not
now
minimize
the
importance
of
their
courageous
women.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
well,
mr.
justice--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--yes,
to
some
degree,
but
perhaps
not
to
another
degree,
mr.
justice.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
we
have
to
be
somewhat
realistic.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
justice,
that
the
retired
military
officer
doesn't
really
have
to
do
anything
any
more.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes?
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
but
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--well,
i
think
that
our
community
property
law
covers
that
in
this
way,
mr.
justice.
under
community
property
law,
once
there
has
been
a
separation
then
the
earnings
of
each
of
the
spouses
then
becomes
his
or
her
separate
property.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
their
subsequent
earnings.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
so
that
if
we
assume
counsel's
argument,
the
way
that
i
can
answer
that
is
really
simply
this,
the
minute
that
he
gets
back
into
the
military
and
he
actually
becomes
part
of
the
active
duty
again,
then
he
is
paid--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--number
one,
he
is
actually
paid
for
his
services,
the
services
that
he
renders
at
that
time.
but
furthermore,
he
also
accrues
further
military
retirement
benefits
all
of
which
will
then
benefit
him.
so--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--i
don't
think
so,
but
perhaps
i
misunderstand
you.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
i
don't
think
that
we're
arguing
about
whether
or
not
it's
true.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
would
then
be
a
property
interest.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
can't
ignore
one
without
the
other.
now,
it
just
depends
upon
how
far
you
really
have
to
go.
if
he's
really,
if
he's
factually
only
on
limited
duty,
then
i
would
have
to
agree.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
in
one
of
our
cases
the
courts
have
addressed
that
issue.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes,
but
that
cuts
both
ways--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--i
believe
that
he
has
that
sole
discretion
or
he
should
have
that
sole
discretion,
mr.
justice.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
the
california
scheme,
under
the
california
law,
that
the
wife
actually
has
no
greater
right
to
the
retirement
than
the
husband,
or,
i
should
say,
actually,
the
spouse.
of
course,
i'm
talking
about
wife
and
husband
here,
because
from
a
practical
standpoint
it
has
been
that
situation
in
99
percent
of
the
cases.
i
might
add
parenthetically
that
now
that
we
have
more
and
more
women
becoming
part
of
the
military,
it
could
easily
cut
the
other
way.
but
getting
back
to
that
for
just
one
moment,
the
wife
in
that
particular
situation
has
absolutely
no
power
at
all
to
increase
her
right.
in
other
words,
if
the
husband
chooses
to
give
the
whole
thing
up,
then
certainly
he
can
do
that,
and
there
is
nothing
that
she
can
do
about
it.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
well,
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
state
that
the
wife
should
have
the
right
to
tell
him
whether
or
not
he
should
remain
in
the
service.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
i
believe
that
under
these
circumstances,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
play
on
words.
and
while
i
agree
that
it
isn't--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--yes.
and
in
the
event
that
they
resign
then
they
for
all
intents
and
purposes
will
defeat
their
spouse's
interest,
and
that
takes
care
of
that,
she's
out.
and
i
recognize
that,
mr.
justice.
i
certainly
feel
that
under
those
circumstances
the
court
should
not
have
the
power
to
keep
him
in
there,
or
to
make
him
work,
or
do
anything
that
he
doesn't
want
to
do.
this,
of
course,
is
part
of
the
overall
scheme,
this
is
part
of
the
community
property
law.
and
we
recognize
that.
i
will
say
that
there
is
one
court
of
appeal
decision
that
came
down
recently,
that
was
mentioned
in
the
reply
brief,
in
which
the
california
court
of
appeal
did
go
one
step
further.
i
personally
disagree
with
that
particular
court
of
appeal
decision.
it
never
went
on
to
the
california
supreme
court,
and
i
assume
that
somehow
or
other
that
point
is
going
to
be
raised
at
a
future
time.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
situation
as
it
is
here
today,
because
essentially,
mr.
justice,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
federal
preemption.
that's
really
all
we're
talking
about.
has
the
federal
law
preempted?
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
hasn't
even
been
mentioned.
nothing
has
been
said
about
it
at
any
time,
one
way
or
another.
and
i
think
it's
every
bit
as
fair
to
say
that
when
the
federal
law
has
not
said
anything
about
it
one
way,
then
it
certainly
is
every
bit
as
fair
the
other.
except
that,
under
the
law,
under
what
is
required
under
the
supremacy
requirement,
there
actually
has
to
be
an
actual
conflict.
and
this
is
something
that
they
have
not
been
able
to
demonstrate.
there
is
no
conflict
at
all
between
our
california
community
property
law
and
military
retirement
benefits.
there
has
not
been
an
unambiguous
mandate.
and
there
certainly
has
not
been
an
interference
with
the
federal
interest.
you
see,
this
is
the
other
requirement.
you
can't
just
have
this
without
a
so-called
damage
provision.
there
has
not
been
any
interference
at
all.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
t.
winter
yes,
it
may,
your
honor.
however,
if
i
may
point
this
out--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--yes,
your
honor,
because
actually--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--well,
i'm
afraid
that
under
present
law
that
cannot
be
done.
however,
i
would
like
to
respond
insofar
as
the
alimony...
you
see,
alimony
has
many,
many
provisions,
many
requirements.
and
one
of
the
requirements,
of
course,
is
that
immediately
upon
the
remarriage
of
the
party
who
is
receiving
the
alimony,
the
recipient,
that
automatically
then
terminates
the
alimony.
now,
this
is
a
property
right
we're
talking
about.
this
is
something
that
they
earned,
both
of
them
together,
during
a
marriage,
and
it
is
not
something
that
should
terminate.
because,
after
all,
why
should
he
get
the
windfall
merely
because
she
remarries?
why
should
she
have
to
then
worry
about
starting
out
all
over
again?
this
is
something
that
they
have
both
worked
for--
mr.
walter
t.
winter
--they
are
without
remedy,
mr.
justice,
because
they
are
losing
a
very
valuable
property
right,
and
spousal
support,
as
we
call
it,
or
alimony,
i
don't
think
is
the
proper
remedy.
because
that
is
subject
to
many,
many
conditions
and
it
is
not
exactly
the
same
thing
as
saying
to
her
that
this
is
something
they
have
and
something
that
is
to
be
divided.
it's
something
that
he
will
keep,
whether
or
not
he
remarries.
so
why
should
he
keep
it
and
she
then
lose
it?
mr.
walter
t.
winter
thank
you.
