justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
eytan,
supposing
that
this
is
ten
years
prior
to
the
divorce
in
this
case
and
the
husband
is
in
the
military.
he
brings
home
his
paycheck,
it's
deposited
in
the
bank
account,
and
a
house
is
bought
with
it
and
paid
for
by
the
time
of
the
divorce.
would
it
be
your
contention
that
that
wouldn't
be
subject
to
equitable
division
under
the
california
formula?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
it's
just
the
in-the-future
retirement
pay
and
not
the
past
accumulations
that
you're
arguing
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
she
collects
only
a
widow's
benefit,
not
the
benefit
of
a
retired
worker
under
social
security?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
a
widow's
benefit,
not
that
of
the
person
who
has
worked,
which
are
quite
different.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
the
congress
passed
the
code
of
military
justice,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
a
sensible
congress
wouldn't
pass
it,
not
that
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
pass
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
eytan,
supposing
on
a
divorce
order
to
show
cause
for
temporary
provisions
pending
a
final
decision,
the
wife
asks
for
$300
alimony.
the
husband
is
an
army
colonel.
do
you
say
that
california
can't
apply
its
own
law
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
railroad
retirement
divorce
law
either,
and
yet
hisquierdo
came
out
the
way
it
did.
how
do
you
distinguish
your
case
from
that?
justice
rehnquist
is
that
like
palimony?
