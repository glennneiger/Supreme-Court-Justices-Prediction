justice

mr.
winter,
suppose
you
lose
this
case
here?
are
you
without
remedy
under
california
law?
you
have
alimony
in
california?
justice
blackmun
and
that
could
be
enforced
against...
well,
his
pension,
once
it
is
received
by
him,
i
suppose?
justice
blackmun
what
you
want
is
a
direct
share
of
the
pension?
you
want
half?
justice
blackmun
payable
by
the
united
state
government?
do
you
want
the
united
states
government
to
pay
her
half
direct
to
your
client?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
even
that
isn't
true
in
all
states.
but
in
any
event,
i
understand
your
property
argument
and
i
think
i
know
what
alimony
is,
but
would
your
argument
about
service
wives...
i
want
to
know
whether
they're
without
remedy
in
case
you
lose
this
case.
and
i
take
it
they
are
not
without
remedy.
