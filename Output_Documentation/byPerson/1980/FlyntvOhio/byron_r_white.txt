justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
federal
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
in
the
matter
of
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
had
some
equal
protection
cases
where
we've
--
in
the
name
of
making
a
constitutional
judgment
with
--
made
our
own
judgment
of
the
historical
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
district
courts
maybe
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
just
comes
from
--
this
comes
from
the
state
court
as
justice
rehnquist
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
--
your
argument
as
understand
it
has
got
two
elements.one,
one
of
the
large
number
of
people
that
are
basically
the
same
is
selected
for
prosecution.
and
secondly,
the
reason
for
it
was
that
he
published
a
political
cartoon
which
would
be
the
impermissible
reason.
then
you
say
the
burden
shifts
to
the
prosecution
to
justify.
what
would
the
prosecution
have
to
do
to
justify
that
kind
of
selective
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
he
have
to
call
his
superiors
in?
he
had
the
authority
to
bring
prosecutions
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
ask
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
already
told
you
“no”
on
that,
there
was
no
consideration
in
prosecuting
anybody
but
the
hustler
as
i
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
reason
they
picked
hustler
was
that
hustler,
they
say,
was
--
had
a
head
office
in
ohio.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
--
don't
you
have
to
get
rid
or
at
least
address
the
question
whether
that's
an
adequate
justification
for
selecting
them
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
