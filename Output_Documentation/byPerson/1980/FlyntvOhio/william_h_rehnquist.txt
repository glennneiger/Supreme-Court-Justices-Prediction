justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fahringer,
might
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
i
realized
that
you're
just
beginning.
but
as
you
are
undoubtedly
aware,
our
jurisdiction
over
appeals
from
or
certiorari
from
these
highest
courts
of
states
is
governed
by
28
u.s.c.
1257,
which
requires
a
final
judgment
or
decree.
as
i
understand
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
opinion
here,
it
simply
remanded
the
case
for
trial.
it
didn't
affirm
a
conviction.
your
client
has
never
been
tried.
why
is
this
a
final
judgment
or
--
or
decree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it's
just
the
12
that
has
--
1257
is
just
an
open-ended
thing
then
that
we
--
if
we
think
the
issue
is
important
that
we
can
take
it
regardless
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
language
used
by
the
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
--
do
we
--
we
don't
have
any
inherent
power.
we
have
the
power
to
interpret
the
statutory
language.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
--
on
the
practical
side
of
the
things,
mr.
fahringer,
what
does
a
prosecutor
do
when
he's
going
to
test
the
statute?
does
he
pick
out
the
weakest
case
insight
or
the
strongest
--
the
strongest
defendant
or
the
most
vulnerable
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
the
most
vulnerable
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
highest
court
of
the
state
say
about
this
issue
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
we
not
bound
by
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
trial
court
prevails
over
the
highest
court
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
--
don't
we
take
the
statement
of
the
fact,
the
historical
facts
of
the
case
as
it
comes
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
even
though
it
may
choose
to
disagree
with
the
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
very
fact
that
he
was
in
dissent
means
that
the
majority
didn't
--
didn't
agree
with
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
may
have
suggested
that
there
should
be.
i
mean
--
all
we
can
review
of
the
--
in
state
court
proceedings
is
questions
of
violations
of
federal
or
constitutional
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fahringer,
what
in
your
opinion,
if
you
had
to
pick
one
case
from
this
court
on
the
question
of
selective
prosecution,
is
the
closest
one
that
supports
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i'm
not
--
i
asked
you
with
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
--
from
this
court,
i
asked.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
a
1257
extremely
doesn't
make
any
such
distinction,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can
also
pick
--
can
he,
can
he
pick
one
he
just
doesn't
like?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
say
there's
ten
ad
he's
going
to
pick
one,
and
he
said,
“well,
they're
all
absolutely
equal
they're
all
be
valid
prosecutions,
i'm
going
to
pick
the
one
i
like
the
least.”
