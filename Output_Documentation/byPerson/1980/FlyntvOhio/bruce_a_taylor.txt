mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
would
like
to
make
a
comment
on
jurisdiction.
although
usually
the
state
prosecutors
who
appear
in
the
federal
courts
whether
it
be
this
court
or
district
courts,
commonly
1983
actions,
the
state
is
usually
in
reluctance
to
submit
to
federal
jurisdiction.
however,
i
think
that
the
procedural
aspect
of
this
case
makes
it
different
than
other
types
of
cases
where
this
court
has
determined
whether
or
not
the
finality
rule
is
subject
to
an
exception
bringing
a
case
up
here
that
is
interlocutory
in
nature
or
whether
there
are
further
procedures
which
can
be
happening
in
the
lower
court
on
remand.
the
difference
is
that
in
this
case,
we
have
a
prosecutor's
appeal.
we
have
brought
larry
flynt
and
his
brother
and
his
wife
here
against
their
will,
as
it
were.
there
should
be
a
distinction
made
by
this
court
in
determining
jurisdiction
between
cases
where
the
prosecutor
loses
in
the
trial
court
on
his
motion
to
dismiss
for
selective
prosecution
as
it
is
in
double
jeopardy.
on
the
contrary,
the
cases
where
the
defendant
wins
his
motion
and
the
prosecutor
appeals,
his
--
the
prosecutor
has
the
right
to
appeal
by
statute
in
ohio.
we
have
to
ask
leave
of
court
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
it
can
go
further
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
one
of
the
requirements
of
1257
is
at
it
be
that
the
--
a
final
of
judgment
or
decree
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
therefore,
when
you
talk
about
a
final
decree,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
has
in
effect,
taken
a
ruling
which
in
a
trial
court
level
applied
only
to
larry
flynt
and
his
brother
and
his
wife,
and
has
broadened
it
into
a
statewide
policy,
cementing
in
stone
the
rule
of
law
in
ohio
as
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
cedes
your
decisions
on
selective
enforcement.
they
have,
in
effect,
made
it
for
everybody.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
and
i
--
i
reluctantly
have
to
say
that
i
--
not
that
i
would
agree
that
the
court
should
have
taken
the
case
or
that
generally
the
court
should
supervise
all
state
court
rulings
in
this
area.
but
that
because
of
the
rulings
this
court
has
made
in
cases
like
cox
broadcasting
versus.cohn
and
radio
station
wow,
the
construction
workers
versus
curry,
all
of
those
cases
were
this
court
had
said
--
in
effect,
those
cases
were
--
when
state
courts
have
said,
“we
have
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
type
claim,
icc
claim”
or,
you
know,
one
of
those
kind
of
things
where
the
federal
government
has
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
--
usually.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
i
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
it's
the
second,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
it's
an
exception,
i
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
i
feel
what
i'm
saying
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
it
falls
under,
i
think
the
broadening
that
you
did
in
cox
in
construction
laborers
v.
curry
and
then
mercantile
bank
versus
langdeau.
and
also
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
not
an
exception
to
the
rule.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
right.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
for
all
practical
purposes.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
right.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
by
an
exception,
this
court
has
discussed
it
as
if
were
an
exception
by
saying,
“even
though
we
have
discussed
finality
in
terms
nothing
further
to
happen
in
the
trial
court,
we
have
on
occasion
said
that
when
something
further
happens
in
the
trail
court
but
it
is
of
no
practical
significance
to
the
issue
decided,
that
is
an
effect
to
final
judgment.”
that's
what
i
mean,
you're
(voice
overlap)
saying
it's
a
final
judgment.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
we'll,
in
a
way
it
is.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
but,
no,
your
honor,
because
it
doesn't
go
away.
if
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
decision
of
flynt
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
but
that's
why
i
said
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
cases
it
that
here,
it
was
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
but
our
supreme
court
has
already
made
policy.
but
because
the
prosecutor
has
the
right
to
appeal,
if
this
court
does
not
review
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
case
and
larry
flynt
is
acquitted
or
we
don't
prosecute
him
or
something
happens,
then
that
ruling
still
applies
to
everybody
else
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
it
generally
does.
i
just
meant
to
comment
on
jurisdiction
only
because
i
feel
that
this
court's,
you
know,
decision
in
some
of
those
cases
has
made
the
finality
rule
broad
enough
to
include
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
case
where
there
are
further
proceedings,
but
that
it
is
first
amendment,
and
there
a
lots
of
cases
that
this
court
--
i'm
not
saying
this
court
has
or
does
not
or
should
keep
this
case
or
not
--
but
i
feel
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
he
can.
he
has
to
preserve
the
record,
obviously.
he
has
to
make
--
he
has
to
reserve
his
exceptions.
but
obviously,
if
the
trial
court
is
bound
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
oh,
yes,
the
trial
court
is
bound
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
they
can't
reverse
it.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
the
trial
court
is
bound
by
the
supreme
court's
ruling,
as
is
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
if
you
decide
it
as
terminated.
although
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
right.
although
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
okay.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
my
position
is
that
--
this
court,
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
he
must.
as
like
i
said,
he
must
preserve
his
exception
and
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
and
that's
why
your
case
is
dealing
with
kind
of
making
judicial
economy,
and
that
kind
of
thing,
cutting
down
ways
would
decide
that
issue
now.
the
other
thing
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
that's
what
i
mean,
cox
and
the
cases,
i
think,
you
know,
notwithstanding
the
--
the
way
you
arrived
that
and
have
carved
out
a
situation
which
i
find
myself
in.
and
what
i
meant
to
ask
the
court
is
that
you
take
note
that
by
saying
that
you
can
supervise
early,
decide
whether
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
correctly
announced
the
law
and
that
should
not
be
construed
by
this
court
or
other
courts
--
then
that
gives
a
defendant
a
correlative
right
to
a
pretrial
collateral
appeal
if
he
loses
his
motion
to
dismiss.
and
if
the
trial
judge
says,
“no,
you
have
to
stand
trial
because
you
were
not
selectively
enforced,”
that
should
not
give
rise
to
an
appeal
by
him
before
trial,
such
as
it
was
just
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
u.s.
versus
wilson
case
just
last
month.
and
the
u.s.
ninth
circuit
has
extended
this
court's
decision
in
abney
which
said
that
double
jeopardy
is
a
pretrial
appeal
to
vindictive
prosecutions.
and
now,
they've
said
vindictive
prosecutions
are
the
same
as
selective
prosection.
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
be
wary
of
the
distinction,
and
that's
the
only
point
i
meant
to
make
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
and
i
think
that
we
are
close
to
that.
a
defendant
losing
his
motion
at
trial
is
governed
by
that
case
rather
than
abney.
abney
was
decided
because
of
the
peculiarity
of
the
double
jeopardy
history
and
because
of
the
significance
of
that
claim.
i
don't
think
selective
prosecution
or
vindictive
prosecution
or
--
or
losing
any
evidence
question
or
motion
to
suppress
should
be
allowed
given
the
defendant's
right
to
a
pretrial
appeal.but
since
that
could
be
--
if
the
court
is
going
to
deal
with
jurisdiction,
i
wish
that
it
take
a
distinction
between
when
a
prosecutor
has
the
right
to
appeal
and
you
are
merely
supervising
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
made
the
correct
decision,
and
one
where
you're
saying
all
selective
prosecution
cases
have
--
give
rise
to
a
direct
appeal
or
right
of
certiorari
grant.
now,
as
far
as
the
merits
of
the
case
which
is,
i
think,
the
allegations
before
us,
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor,
i
think,
is
--
is
important
when
it's
clear
on
the
facts
of
the
record
that
the
prosecutor
is
vindictive.
if
the
prosecutor
in
cameron
versus
johnson
for
instance
had
enforce
the
new
anti-picketing
statute
that
was
passed
while
the
people
were
picketing
the
court
house
and
he
had
picked
out
the
guy
to
be
arrested,
he'd
sent
the
cops
after
the
guy
that
wasn't
the
leader,
then
i
think
he'd
have
been
in
trouble.
but
since
he
--
they
passed
the
new
ordinance
and
statute
and
he
enforced
it,
generally,
this
court
said,
“well
it's
a
new
statute,
we've
got
to
test
it.
and
you
can't
say
that
it's
invidious
until
you
have
a
course
of
conduct.”
i
think
that
the
course
of
conduct
requirements,
were
this
court
has
said
that
you
must
prove
that
something
happens
over
and
over
again
are
important
because
as
this
court
stated
in
sunday
lake
iron,
which
is
a
good
example
of
a
selective
prosecution
case,
practically,
uniformity
is
the
aim
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
the
emphasis,
i
think,
is
impractical.
and
i
think
that
the
issue
on
this
case
is
important
to
us
because
there
are
two
types
of
crimes
that
we
must
deal
within
the
cities
now.
those
are
the
cases
that
come
to
us
and
we
have
no
discretion
to
deny
or
to
prosecute.
murders
or
robberies
or
assault,
those
kinds
of
crimes
which
happen,
and
then
there
are
people
arrested,
we
have
to
take
those
cases.
the
cases
we
have
to
martial
our
resources
and
decide
what
to
with
are
what
we
call
”discretionary
cases”,
you
know,
the
organized
criminal
activity
that's
ongoing,
everybody
knows
about
it,
it's
flagrantly
done
like
i'd
said,
any
prostitution,
gambling,
white
collar
crime,
those
kinds
of
things.
where
you
know
there's
people
violating
the
law
and
you
have
to
decide
what
to
do
about
it.
at
this
point
in
our
history,
obscenity
crimes
have
become
such
a
multi-million-dollar
industry
that
they
in,
in
effect,
have
more
money
than
we
do.
and
as
he
pointed
out,
there
could
be
50
magazines,
50
magazines
capable
of
defending
a
lawsuit
that
the
city
of
cleveland
could
bring,
who
has
--
had
one
assistant
prosecutor,
who
also
--
even
though
i
did
obscenity
cases,
and
they
all
were
mine,
i
also
did
all
the
negligent
homicides
and
i
did
2,000
other
cases.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
we
--
we
can
do
both
in
ohio,
yes.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
your
honor,
we
did
it
once
with
the
hustler
case
because
we
--
after
we
charged
hustler,
we
were
afraid
that
hustler
would
start,
you
know,
publishing
more
stuff
about
this
case.
and
we
figured
that
we
could
test
it,
not
only
criminally
but
civilly,
to
get
a
judge
in
effect
in
a
common
pleas
court
to
agree
that
it's
obscene,
that
would
kind
of
help
our
case
and
it
would
make
publicity
and
the
juries
would
know
about
it.
and
obviously,
we
would
be
able
to
somewhat
gauge
the
waters
before
the
trial
and
whether
or
not
a
judge
was
going
to
agree
to
us
that
this
magazine
was
obscene
before
we
were
going
to
go
through
a
trial.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
yes.
and
the
reason
is
that,
an
injunction
statute,
to
answer
both
questions,
is
very
impractical.
it's
useless
for
magazine
cases.
it's
okay
for
film
cases,
but
only
the
kinds
of
film
cases
which
you're
going
to
play
for
a
month.
if
deep
throat
comes
to
cleveland,
they're
going
to
want
to
show
it
a
long
time
to
get
their
money
back.
well,
if
you
got
an
injunction
after
seven
or
ten
days,
that
would
have
some
effect.
but
the
peep
shows
where
you
put
a
quarter
in
and
see
a
movie
and
there's
14
movie
projectors
in
a
booth,
or
magazine
rack
where
every
single
month,
50
different
issues
comes
out.
well,
getting
an
injunction
ten
days
later
on
one
magazine
is
not
going
to
do
any
good,
they
can
bring
a
truckload
in
and
replace
it.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
nobody
in
this
country
is
prosecuting
magazines
under
the
civil
injunction
statute
because
it
doesn't
have
any
(voice
overlap)
presidential
effect.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
we
filed
it
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
we
had
a
discussion
on
discriminatory
prosecution.
and
the
trial
judge
issued
a
temporary
injunction
for
14
days.
and
they
filed
--
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
writ
of
mandate
and
court
of
appeals
denied
the
writ
of
mandate,
and
the
defendants
dissolved
their
appeal,
they
dismissed
their
appeal
and
did
not
appeal
the
trial
court's
decision
on
the
injunction.
they
just
let
it
lie.
because
by
that
time,
a
new
monthly
issue
was
ready
to
come
up,
i
think.i
mean
i
can't
speak
for
them
but
they
did
dissolve
the
issue
as
soon
as
they
--
as
soon
as
it
happened.
and
everything
is
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no.
we
prosecuted
on
the
july
and
august
issues
and
we
did
civilly
on
the
september
issue.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
it
could
be
permissible.
if
it
--
when
i
argue
this
case
to
the
jury,
if
it
goes
to
the
jury,
i'm
going
to
say
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
but
in
this
court
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
that
wouldn't
be
permissible,
(voice
overlap)
and
i
would
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
your
honor,
it's
--
i
think
that
--
we
tried
to
make
it
obvious,
although
i
didn't
know
that
--
i
wasn't
prepared
to
testify
at
the
time
when
we
had
this
hearing.
you
know,
i
just
spoke
what
i
thought
was
on
my
mind.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
of
course.
well,
whether
or
not
the
magazine
would
have
come
to
our
attention,
we
don't
know.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
your
honor.
this
trial
judge,
he
didn't
say
that.
what
the
trial
judge
said
was
that
“i
understand
that
this
--
i
won't
take
cognizance
that
this
is
the
first
case,
but
i
--
i
must
look
to
see
that
it's
the
only
case.
and
therefore
a
--
a
single
case
in
impermissible.”
he
was
on
the
view
that
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
test
case,
and
that
it
really
does
not
matter
if
there
is
a
good
reason
for
having
one
case
or
a
bad
reason.
he
thought
that,
you
know,
selective
prosecution
was
a
question
of
numbers,
and
he
says
so
in
his
opinion.
“i'm
only
concerned
with
whether
not
it's
the
only
case
on
the
docket.
and
since
it
is,
i
have
to
dismiss
it.”
he
did
it
reluctantly
and
judge
calandra
is
one
of
the
two
judges
on
that
court
that
has
held
the
vast
majority
of
our
trials
in
these
cases.
and
rather
than
dismissing
them
or
granting
motion
to
suppress,
so
he
--
he's
ruling,
he
more
or
less
blamed
it
on
me
in
his
decision,
saying
that
you
know,
“you
have
should
done
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
--
something
else.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well
i
--
yes,
for
at
least
two
or
three
years;
more
than
that,
actually;
these
magazines
has
been
around
for
years,
i
guess.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
originally,
it
was
because
the
police
got
complaints
about
the
magazine.
not
always
about
the
cartoons,
some
of
them
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
it
was
the
july
--
it
was
the
july
‘76
issue,
the
bicentennial
issue,
and
it
was
just
--
if
it
had
been
the
july
‘75
issue,
it
might
not
have
raised
a
stink.
but
it
did
because
it
had
a
picture
on
the
cover
of
a
girl's
bikini
made
out
of
a
flag.
and
you
know,
that
issue
probably
just
caused
more
--
it
was
more
visible.
so
people
complained
about
it,
they
really
had
never
done
that
before.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
that's
what
triggered
us
noticing
the
magazine.
now,
we
had
done
hundreds
of
prosecutions,
we
have
been
to
trial
at
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
no,
your
honor.
i
mean
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
it
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
they
would
make
a
difference
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
right,
it
would
make
difference
only
if
the
prosecutor
had
the
right
and
was
--
was
trying
to
send
the
cops
after
somebody.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
but
usually
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
unless
it's
vindictive
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
--
like
you
said,
like
it
has
been
decided
in
some
other
cases.
but
i
think
that
it
usually
doesn't
matter.
i
mean
i
should
be
able
to
pick
somebody
and
if
say
that
i
can
arrest
larry
flynt
because
he
lives
in
columbus,
i
can
arrest
hugh
heffner,
i'm
going
to
--
it's
going
to
cause
the
city
a
lot
of
money
to
start
prosecuting
the
owners
of
other
magazines
and
we
have
that
right,
i
think.
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
well,
that
s
the
reason.
we
can't
afford
to
--
mr.
bruce
a.
taylor
yes.
and
that's
one
of
the
things,
not
only
did
they
say,
“here's
the
law
on
selective
prosecution,
go
back
to
the
trial
court
and
apply
it.”
they
said
--
in
effect,
they
decided
the
factual
issue,
“yes,
this
is
not
a
prima
facie
case,
the
prosecutor
did
not
discriminate.
he
did
have
a
valid
test
case.”
and
i
think
that
this
court
is
bound
by
that
portion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
ruling.
in
cases
like
ward
versus
illinois
and
michigan
versus
new
york
and
some
other
cases,
this
court
has
said
you
are
bound
by
decisions
of
the
state
court
unless
clearly,
you're
erroneous
or
violative
of
some
other
provision
of
the
constitution.
i
think
that
what
this
court
should
--
could
zero
in
on
is
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
announced
the
proper
rule
of
law,
because
that
is
a
general
pronouncement
in
ohio.
but
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
correctly
reviewed
the
facts,
they
really
didn't,
they
affirmed
the
court
of
appeals
who
reviewed
the
facts.
and
in
ohio,
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
last
court
which
can
review
the
facts
and
the
evidence.
thank
you
very
much.
i
now
yield
to
the
solicitor
general.
