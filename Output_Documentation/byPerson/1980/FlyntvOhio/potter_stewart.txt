justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
purport
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
statutory
rule,
we
don't
have
any
power
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
gives
us
jurisdiction
only
from
final
judgments
of
the
highest
courts
of
the
state
of
the
state
in
which
the
decision
was
made.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
the
cox
case
and
the
other
cases
upon
which
you
rely
simply
said
that
the
judgment
was
final
--
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it
was
not
an
exception
to
the
statute,
we
haven't
any
power
to
do
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
certainly
is
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
it
might
end
with
a
judgment
of
not
guilty.
and
then
any
decision
we
should
--
0should
have
made
on
this
case
or
on
the
merits
would
simply
be
no
more
than
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
go
away
entirely
with
respect
to
these
petitioners
if
they
were
found
not
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
this
court
is
here
to
decide
cases
and
controversies,
not
to
make
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
true
of
every
single
common
law
jurisdiction
in
this
country,
49
states
that
a
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
is,
although
it's
been
cast
in
terms
of
a
versus
b,
it
lays
down
a
rule
of
law
that's
applicable
to
all
parties
similarly
situated?
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
case
goes
to
trial
and
the
defendant
is
convicted,
you're
not
suggesting
that
is
--
that
under
ohio
law,
he
can't
present
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
can
make
--
the
--
the
issue
of
selective
prosecution,
if
we
dismissed
this
case,
could
survive
and
be
presented
here
if
he
is
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
didn't
--
didn't
we
on
mcdonald
say
that
speedy
trail
claims
were
not
governed
even
within
the
federal
system
by
abney?
justice
potter
stewart
what
difference
does
it
make
that
triggers
the
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
have
you
conceded
to
my
brother
stevens
what
you
have.
the
prosecution
will
be
tried
on
the
merits
in
the
trial,
will
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
petitioner
can
certain
his
defenses
including
the
first
amendment
or
any
other
defenses
that
he
has.
and
what
real
difference
does
it
make
if
the
prosecutors
likes
or
doesn't
like
the
person
to
be
prosecuted?
justice
potter
stewart
or
what
triggered
the
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
the
merits
of
the
prosecution
will
be
tested
at
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
under
our
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
system
the
prosecutor
has
that
right,
unreviewable
and
uncontrollable,
unless
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unfortunately.
justice
potter
stewart
absolutely.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
agree
he
could
not
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
let's
assume
that
it
was
not
the
sole
reason
but
that
the
only
disguising
factor
from
all
other
magazines,
and
it
was
one
of
the
reasons,
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what's
he
prosecuting
him
for?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
prosecute
him
for
printing
the
editorial.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
probably
prosecuting
the
newspaper
for
tax
evasion,
or
for
something
else.
