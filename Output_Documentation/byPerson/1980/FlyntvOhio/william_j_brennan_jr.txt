justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
that
won't
be
a
matter,
it
won't
be
--
that
--
be
a
matter
of
the
merits
at
the
trial,
you'll
have
a
defense
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
on
the
merits
of
the
trial,
of
the
prosecution.
and
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
why
isn't
--
in
a
system
of
adversary
criminal
justice
such
as
we
have,
and
trusting
so
much
unreview
--
unreviewable
and
uncontrollable
discretion
to
a
prosecutor,
why
isn't
as
the
chief
justice
and
our
brother
marshall
have
suggested,
why
isn't
any
prosecution
a
selective
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
must
say
that,
sorry,
the
great
discretion,
unreviewable
and
uncontrollable,
that
we
confide
in
prosecutors
under
our
systems
shocks
our
brothers
in
continental
europe,
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
yick
wo
was
something
--
yick
wo
involved
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
of
san
francisco,
i
guess
it
was,
that
was
on
its
face
applied
all
laundries,
but
in
practical
fact,
applied
only
the
chinese
laundries.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
not
this
kind
of
a
case,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
falk
is
a
constitutional
case
with
a
federal
persecution,
you
read
falk
as
a
constitutional
holding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
arguing
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
final
within
1257
or
that
we
ought
to
carve
an
exception
to
the
finality
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
which
is
it?
the
first
or
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
an
exception
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
--
within
other
cases,
where
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
cases
does
it
fall
in
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
has
gone
on
in
the
trial
court
is
of
great
significance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
that
half
the
trial
that
follows
--
assume
that
the
trial
does
take
place
in
this
case,
may
the
defendant
again
argue
that
the
prosecution
should
be
terminated
because
he
was
selected
out
for
an
impermissible
reason?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
can
do
that
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
issue
resolved
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
going
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
have
another
hearing
with
the
same
witnesses
in
--
during
the
trial,
that
you
had
on
the
issue
as
you
had
in
this
case
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
we
either
dismiss
the
appeal
or
affirm,
the
issue
of
selective
prosecution
will
be
totally
terminated
in
this
litigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
dismissed
the
appeal
either
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
the
prosecution
will
go
forward
on
other
issues.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
your
statute,
you
could
bring
civil
proceedings
against
these
magazines
too,
can't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
--
have
the
--
has
the
civil
injunctive
power
ever
been
invoked
in
your
jurisdiction
to
try
and
curtail
this
practice
among
any
of
these
magazines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
injunction
suit
against
hustler?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
case
above
in
the
same
issue,
or
the
one
with
political
cartoon
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
your
position
on
the
selective
prosecution
issue?
is
it
your
view
that
if
you
were
to
acknowledge
that
the
reason
you
chose
hustler
was
because
of
his
cartoon,
would
that
be
a
permissible
or
an
impermissible
reason
in
your
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
are
you
arguing
to
this
court,
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
a
permissible
reason
to
--
you
have
--
say
you
had
half
a
dozen
magazines
to
choose
from.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
the
record
show
that
the
cartoon
played
any
part
of
the
decision
to
prosecute
this
magazine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
said
the
record
really
supports
the
inference
that
the
cartoon
was
totally
irrelevant,
it
would
have
come
to
your
attention
anyway
and
you
would
have
picked
hustler
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
think
that
was
the
case,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
does
the
record
explain
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
does
the
record
tell
us
why
apart
from
the
cartoon,
a
decision
was
made
to
prosecute
any
of
these
sophisticated
magazines.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
had
been
rather
widely
distributed
for
two
or
three
years,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
prompted
the
going
after
one
of
this
group
of
magazines
if
it
wasn't
the
cartoon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
get
complains
about
any
issues
that
didn't
have
the
cartoon
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
triggered
the
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
say
then
that
the
--
that's
there
absolutely
no
political
factors
involved
in
selecting
this
magazine
for
this
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
situation,
could
he
select
his
defendant
because
of
the
cartoon
he
published?
what
is
your
view
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
could
he?
could
he
do
it
because
of
the
cartoon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
if
it
was
one
of
reason.
but
it
always
has
some
other
reason,
why
then,
it's
a
--
it's
a
test
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
what
if
he
had
to
pick
the
one
that
he
has
the
dad
most
protests
about.
