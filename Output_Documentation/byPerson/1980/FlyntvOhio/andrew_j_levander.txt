mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.i
would
like
primarily
to
address
the
merits
of
petitioner's
selective
prosecution
claim.
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
amicus
curiae
brief,
we
believe
that
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction
under
section
1257
to
hear
this
case.
this
case
is
different
than
cox
broadcasting
and
some
other
cases,
this
cases
falls
into
this
morning's
decision
at
san
diego
electric
and
the
long
line
of
cases
including
albas,
republic
gas
company,
radio
station
wow,
cox
broadcasting.
dictum
would
say
that
where
there
are
other
federal
issues
pending
to
be
determined
on
the
remand,
then
it
would
highly
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case
which
could
come
back
again
after
all
the
federal
issues
have
been
decided.
as
been
pointed
out
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
comments,
the
decision
below,
the
trial
will
produce
other
federal
questions
if
petitioners
are
convictive.
of
course
if
they
are
acquitted,
this
court
would
never
have
to
reach
the
selective
prosecution
claim.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
--
that
the
decision
is
not
final,
within
the
meaning
of
1257.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
point,
or
two
other
points.
first,
some
of
the
decisions
like
cox
broadcasting
and
miami
herald,
which
have
stretched
the
concept
of
finality
to
some
extent
have
done
so
on
the
basis,
i
think,
that
was
pressing
first
amendment
issue
which
affect
a
lot
of
the
press
as
a
whole
and
the
public
as
a
whole,
and
there
were
really
no
other
federal
issues
to
be
decided.
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
imperative
that
the
decision
be
made
at
that
time.
a
selective
prosecution
claimant,
a
petitioner
of
selective
prosecution
claim
is,
by
definition,
very
different.
it
only
affects
a
historical
fact
in
these
petitioners,
by
definition,
is
not
affecting
the
other
members
of
the
press
because
under
their
claim,
the
state
of
ohio
has
failed
to
prosecute
under
members
of
the
press.
therefore
it
seems,
you
know,
completely
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
try
to
spread
some
jurisdictional
provisions,
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
dismiss
the
writ.
my
brother
did
point
out
one
other
matter
of
great
concern
on
the
jurisdiction
was
to
us,
and
that
is
the
ninth
circuit's
recent
decision
in
wilson.
that
decision
held
that
a
district
court's
denial
of
a
selective
prosecution
claim
while
at
trial
was
immediately
appealable
by
the
defendant.
now,
that
is
going
to
cause
havoc
with
the
criminal
justice
system
because
any
defendant
could
come
in
and
make
a
selective
prosecution
claim.
and
if
he's
denied
at
hearing
or
he's
denied
on
the
merits,
then
he
can
simply
take
an
appeal,
it's
much
different
than
abney
double
jeopardy
claims,
also
the
equal
protection
clauses
i
have
at
history
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
he
can't,
your
honor,
because
we
prevailed
on
the
merits
in
the
case
after
they
reached
the
--
so
--
but
in
deciding
this
jurisdictional
issue,
i
urge
the
court
to
be
very
aware
of
this
problem.
and
--
and
if
the
court
would
like,
we'd
be
willing
to
submit
a
post-argument
brief
in
short
order
on
this
point
if
it
would
be
any
use
to
the
court.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
trial
court
held
as
a
matter
law
that
where
there
is
a
test
case,
where
there
is
one
defendant
among
similarly
situated
other
defendants
and
a
prosecution
of
law
only
against
the
one,
but
that
is
legally
insufficient,
there
were
not
factual
findings
as
--
as
the
ohio
supreme
court
noted
on
the
footnote
at
the
end
of
it's
opinion.
there
--
there
were
no
factual
findings
by
the
trial
court
about
bad
faith,
bad
motives,
cartoons,
anything.
it
simply
stated
that
it
was
legally
insufficient
to
have
a
test
case.
now,
my
brother
mr.
fahringer
has
sort
of
waffled
in
his
point
this
morning,
but
in
his
reply
writ
at
page
five,
he
concedes
now
begrudgingly
that
a
test
case
is
an
appropriate
as
prosecutorial
stratagem.
that
concession
is
well
warranted
in
light
of
this
decision
--
this
court's
decisions
on
mackay
telegraph,
moog
industries
and
universal-rundle
corp,
which
were
all
cited
in
the
briefs,
as
well
as
many
other
cases.
where
there
are
just
numerous
defendants
similarly
situated
and
the
prosecutor
lacks
resources
to
prosecute
all,
or
where
the
law
is
at
some
question
whether
there
is
--
whether
the
laws
can
be
applied
to
a
particular
kind
of
situation
or
particular
kind
of
defendant.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
i
think
he
could
select
him
randomly,
and
the
courts
have
so
held.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he
could
not
do
it.
he
could
select
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
if
the
cartoon
is
constitutionally
protected
and
he
was
doing
because
he
was
punishing
for
an
exercise
of
constitutional
right,
we
would
agree
that
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
not
the
question
here.
because
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
evidence
is
unequivocal
as
to
what
happenned.
there
were
complaints
made
about
the
july
hustler
issue,
some
of
those
complaints
focused
on
the
cartoon,
some
of
them
focused
on
the
magazine
as
a
whole.
but
even
assuming
that
every
complaint
focused
on
the
cartoon
and
that
spurred
an
investigation,
it
is
not
--
it's
simply
irrelevant
in
an
equal
protection
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
believe
it
would
be
if
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
exactly
right.
and
in
the
--
in
the
court's
equal
protection
cases,
mt.healthy
against
doyle,
justice
powell's
opinion
for
the
court
in
bakke,
in
arlington
heights
footnote
21,
the
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
“where
in
an
equal
protection
case,
the
moving
party,
here
the
petitioners,
have
established
that
invidious
or
discriminate,
intentionally
discriminatory
reason
is
the
motivating
cause
for
a
particular
kind
of
state
action,”
--
and
we
don't
have
that
here,
we
have
--
did
not
establish
that
--
“then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
to
show
that
the
invidious
factors
not
the
“but
for”
cause.”
so
that
is
--
that
is
the
test.
here,
we
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
we
get
to
the
“but
for”
problem.
if
we
do,
i
think
that
the
prosecutor's
testimony
at
the
hearing
overwhelmingly
shows
that
the
decision
to
prosecute
was
made
on
various
rational
factors,
including
his
view
that
hustler
has
more
obscene,
the
fact
that
was
a
more
notorious
violator
of
the
law,
the
fact
that
was
in-state
and
even
if
you
could
get
extradition
over
these
other
out-of-state
publishers,
there
was
no
need
for
cleveland
to
expend
that
additional
money
in
bringing
a
test
case
to
pick
the
most
difficult
to
prosecute.
as
the
chief
had
said
earlier
today,
he
can
pick
the
strongest
case
and
he
can
pick
the
easiest
case
for
himself,
that's
entirely
appropriate.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
if
he
--
then
the
question
goes
to
me
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
certainly,
where
he
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that
is
entirely
appropriate
because
it's
an
aim
of
the
criminal
law
not
only
to
punish,
but
to
deter.
and
in
so
--
insofar
as
the
particular
defendant
has
the
most
notoriety
and
therefore
the
effect
of
a
conviction
will
be
most
telling
on
the
future
compliance,
certainly
picking
out
the
most
notorious
offender
is
perfectly
appropriate.
and
in
certain
cases
like
tax
cases,
for
example,
where
there's
a
protester
who
has
willfully
violated
the
laws,
his
public
statements
will
facilitate
the
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
one
would
hope
that
the
prosecutorial
decision
making
was
not
made
on
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
i
don't
think
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
i
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
that's
--
i
mean
--
they
would
enforce,
obviously
--
an
obvious
first
amendment
defenses.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
he's
prosecuting
--
no,
no,
no.
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
that's
right,
that's
the
question.
here
he
is
prosecuting
for
an
obscene
(voice
overlap)
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
he's
not
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
no,
no,
it's
the
sole
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
and
--
and
the
sole
reason
that
you
wouldn't
have
prosecuted
but
for
a
particular
editorial,
that
it
seems
to
me
might
be
inappropriate.
but
if
he
would
have
prosecuted
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
if
it
--
if
his
intent
is
to
silence
a
constitutional
right,
or
if
it
is
an
invidious
race-based
or
religious-based
or
other
arbitrary
kind
of
base
--
basis
for
the
prosecution
and
it's
the
--
that
the
soul
--
and
it's
a
product
of
that
kind
of
invidious,
kind
arbitrary
or
irrational
discrimination,
then
you
have
problem.
that
was
not
even
the
--
the
conclusory
allegations
in
--
in
this
case
did
not
even
warrant
a
hearing.
he
admitted
that
he
had
no
idea
what
the
--
what
the
proof
was
going
to
show
when
the
prosecutor
took
the
stand.
i
mean
in
our
view
under
federal
law,
a
hearing
was
not
even
necessary
in
this
case.
the
hearing
did
show
however,
quite
conclusively,
that
this
prosecution
was
perfectly
permissible
and
rationally
chosen.
and
we
think
that
more
difficult
cases,
you
know,
might
arise,
this
is
certainly
not
one
of
those
cases.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
about
the
--
that
the
cartoon,
if,
justice
stevens,
you
were
right
that
insofar
as
the
prosecution
was
based
that
all
in
the
cartoon,
that
it
would
be
an
impermissible
prosecution,
then
anytime
you
had
a
complaining
witness
who
brought,
i
see
my
time
--
okay,
this
is
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
thank
you.
anytime
you
had
a
complaining
witness
who
believed
or
brought
the
--
the
crimes
to
the
notice
of
the
police
because
they
didn't
like
the
defendant,
let's
assume
it's
a
drug
pusher
or
--
or
a
bank
robber,
or
whatever
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
well,
for
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
for
example,
suppose
--
suppose
the
--
an
employee
at
the
--
at
the
--
at
a
newspaper
or
not
even
an
employee,
a
person
who
knows
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
--
that
there's
discrimination
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
fine.
the
--
the
person
who
reports
the
violations
of
labor
standard
act,
or
some
other
--
or
tax
evasion,
does
so,
a
private
person,
because
he
has
a
dislike
for
the
editorial
policy
of
a
particular
paper,
it
is
invidious
state
action
which
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
private
motivation
of
the
reporting
party
which
leads
the
investigation
is
simply
irrelevant.
and
--
and
therefore
--
mr.
andrew
j.
levander
yes,
completely
relevant.
thank
you
very
much.
