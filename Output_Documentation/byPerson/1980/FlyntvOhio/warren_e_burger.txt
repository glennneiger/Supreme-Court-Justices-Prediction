chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
flynt
against
ohio.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
hold
a
minute
until
your
friends
get
ready.
mr.
fahringer,
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
by
putting
one
political
cartoon
in
another
lies
pornographic
publication.
the
--
the
publisher
insulates
himself
from
prosecution
under
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
what's
the
significance
of
the
political
cartoon
that
you
mentioned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
--
did
the
highest
court
of
ohio
say
something
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
as
justice
marshall
had
suggested,
the
prosecutor
always
selects
and
--
and
you
have
conceited
that
if
he
knows
what
his
business,
he's
going
to
select
the
strongest
case
for
the
prosecution
and
the
most
vulnerable
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
impermissible
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
--
then
we
come
back
to
the
proposition
that
by
putting
one
political
cartoon,
the
publisher
is
going
to
be
insulated
from
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
didn't
say
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
rico
statute,
are
you
familiar
with
that,
mr.
fahringer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
supposing
the
government,
seeing
the
statute,
passed
for
the
first
time,
in
charged
with
the
duty
to
enforce
it,
picks
out
the
biggest
group
of
mobsters
it
can
in
the
country
and
goes
after
them,
rather
than
a
group
of
smaller
mobsters,
would
you
say
that
was
a
selective
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn't
he
make
that
discission
when
he
dropped
the
charges?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
--
what
the
law,
what
case
ever
said
that
he's
got
to
articulate
his
reasoning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
it's
been
decided
in
this
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
were
to
adhere
to
it's
previous
ruling,
as
is
what
we
expected
to
do,
opposing
the
counsel,
that's
certainly
preserved
the
point,
and
again
petition
for
certiorari
with
a
final
judgment,
if
he
is
convicted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
a
prosecutor
making
the
choice
or
considering
the
choice
between
a
civil
injunction
suit
under
criminal
prosecution,
would
you
take
into
an
account
the
rather
stringent
additive
this
court
has
expressed
on
the
prior
restraint
of
publications?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
any
event,
hasn't
the
highest
court
of
the
state
resolve
this
question
by
saying
that
there
was
no
improper
selection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levander?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
in
this
case
the
one
that
defends
the
prosecutor
the
most.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
fahringer?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
didn't
agree
with
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
decision
that's
binding
on
us,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
