justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
government
going
to
try
to
bring
wilson
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
says
that,
“in
my
next
campaign,
i
will
get
further
if
i
go
after
this
magazine
rather
than
another?”
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
isn't
what
i
--
it
isn't
what
i
asked
you,
what
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
have
us
understand
that
in
tax
cases
and
regulatory
cases,
as
you
would,
in
cases
involving
publications
magazine
and
newspapers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
say
the
same
breadth
of
discretion
and
the
prosecutor
published
--
prosecuting
those
papers
because
he
doesn't
like
editorial
point
of
view,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
your
answer
as
i
understand
it,
that's
perfectly
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
“we
don't
like
the
kind
of
editorials
they've
been
writing
we'll
prosecute
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
he
prosecuting
him
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
prosecuting
him
for
a
crime
that
all
the
other
newspapers
are
committing
the
same
way,
they
want
to
do
some
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
--
you
just
picked
him
out
for
that
reason,
it's
all.
you
don't
prosecute
anybody
who
doesn't
write
such
an
editorial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
on
--
on
your
answers
to
justice
white.
you
said
he
doesn't
like
him
and
that's
all
that
counts.
and
he
may
not
like
him
because
of
the
editorials.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
case
involves
a
publication,
let's
--
let's
have
examples
of
either
newspapers
or
magazines.
i'm
sure
the
difference
in
armed
robbery
and
burglary
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
would
be
entirely
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
right
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say
an
editorial
writer,
state
--
give
us
a
case
involving
an
editorial
writer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
irrelevant
if
the
record
were
clear
that
there
were
about
200
other
people
just
like
this
one
that
they
had
never
prosecuted
in
here?
