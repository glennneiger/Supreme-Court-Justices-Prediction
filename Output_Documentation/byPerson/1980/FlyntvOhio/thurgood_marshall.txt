justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
possible
to
have
a
test
case
that's
not
selective?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
i
said,
my
question
was,
will
you
have
a
one
single,
a
test
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
obviously
a
selective
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
prosecutor
was
prejudiced
against
your
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
consider
the
prosecutor
being
prejudiced
against
your
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
still
lying
and
all
i've
been
saying
is
whether
they're
prejudiced
against
a
group
of
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
prosecutor
was
prejudiced
against
a
group
people
or
an
individual.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
same
as
racial
prejudice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
so,
what
section
of
the
constitution
protects
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
said
you
were
relying
on
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if
the
prosecutor
prosecuted
another
magazine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right
now,
right
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
heard
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
as
--
if
at
right
now,
they've
prosecuted
another
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
solve
the
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
end
your
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
supposed
they
file
fixes
against
six
magazines?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
they
do
it
right
now?
would
that
solve
that
your
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there's
nothing
that
the
government
can
do
now
but
turn
your
man
loose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
they
have
a
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
they
have
a
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
they
have
been
selected
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
get
--
i
was
--
i
don't
know
if
things
have
changed,
but
i
thought
most
that
we
would
thought
that
if
a
prosecutor
did
not
prosecute,
the
good
lord
couldn't
do
anything
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
nobody
else,
i
thought
that's
what
the
law
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
first
place,
yick
wo
and
hopkins
would
not
have
a
selective
prosecution
case,
that
you
rely
on
so
dearly.
it
was
an
ordinance
that
was
deliberately
passed,
and
this
court
so
found.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
doesn't
help
you
on
that.
now
what
case
helps
you
on
selective
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if,
in
a
hypothetical
case,
a
prosecutor
prosecuted
a
man
for
murder,
with
eight
fixed
eyewitnesses,
but
it
was
shown
that
they
were
bitter
enemies?
the
prosecutor
and
the
man
involved?
would
that
man
go
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
don't
know
one
town,
there
always
had
one
murder.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
know
yet
whether
this
man
has
committed
the
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir,
in
this
case
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
want
to
find
out,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
all
the
other
magazines
and
said,
“why
weren't
they
prosecuted?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
can
do
that
thing
and
do
that
at
the
trial.
