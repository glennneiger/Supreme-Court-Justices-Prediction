mr.
herald
price
fahringer
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
the
resolution
to
the
question
post
by
this
case,
which
is
of
constitutional
dimension
and
i
believe
one
of
the
first
impression
is
bound
to
carry
implications
and
give
directions
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
this
case.
and
that
simple
question
as
i
view
it
is
this.
where
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
selective
prosecution,
is
it
sufficient
for
the
prosecutor
to
simply
deny
those
allegations
and
suggest
or
intimate
that
this
was
a
test
case?
we
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
under
that
section,
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
this
is
a
final
judgment
or
decree,
but
under
that
section,
you've
invoked
your
power
in
first
amendment
cases
which
this
is
as
the
government
acknowledges
in
their
brief
on
a
number
of
occasions
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issue.
we
believe
in
view
of
the
controversy
that
has
been
generated
by
this
case,
it
will
be
well
now
to
resolve
this
issue
because
of
its
widespread
importance.
and
i
believe
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
--
i
think
you
have
in
the
past
done
that,
in
a
number
of
cases
involving
injunctions
and
matters
of
that
kind,
which
i
believe
this
we
come
well
within
the
reach
of
those
cases
and
--
and
i
would
--
i
would
beseech
you
to
invoke
your
jurisdiction
under
that
inherent
power
you
have
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issue.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
your
honor,
i
just
am
of
the
view
that
the
--
this
case
is
relied
upon
in
the
amicus
brief
where
they
indicate
you
have
done
this
before
whether
it
has
not
been
a
final
judgment
is
--
is
--
we
are
a
good
candidate
for
--
for
that
type
of
disposition.
the
facts
can
be
introduced
to
the
court
in
rather
summary
fashion.
i
know
you're
aware
of
them
but
i'd
like
to
just
simply
highlight
in
the
hearing
conducted
in
cleveland.
we
established
and
it
is
conceited
by
all
that
hustler
magazine
was
the
only
magazine
prosecuted
although
there
were
many
other
magazines
similar
to
it,
comparable
to
it,
and
in
one
point,
the
prosecution
even
conceited
more
explicit
than
hustler.
we
also
established
that
at
least,
at
the
very
least,
the
investigation
was
launched
because
of
a
political
cartoon
which
disparaged
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
a
member
of
his
cabinet
and
governor
rockefeller.
and
at
the
very
most,
the
prosecutor
conceited
during
the
hearing
that
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
prosecution
was
initiated
even
though
he
said
later
on
that
upon
examination
of
the
magazine
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
absolutely
not.
he
would
pick
the
strongest,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
absolutely,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
it
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
they
said
and
--
and
this
brings
us
to
a
very
important
issue
in
this
case.
they
said
we
did
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
that
we
had
the
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
don't
believe
you
are,
your
honor.
if
we
were
bound
by
anything
in
this
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
and
then
we
urge
it
in
the
second
branch
of
our
brief
that
you
are
bound
by
the
--
the
trial
judge's
findings.
the
ohio
law
is
well-established
that
great
weight
is
given
to
his
time.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
judge
who
hears
the
witnesses,
observes
the
witnesses,
has
been
in
the
past
been
given
great
deference
on
fact
finding
issues.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honors
in
this
case
where
he
heard
the
witnesses
testify
and
was
present
and
was
able
to
observe
their
demeanor,
he
is
in
a
better
position
to
judge
the
credibility.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
--
i
don't
believe
you're
obliged
to,
your
honor.
i
believe
you
have
the
power
to
go
to
the
trial
court
where
the
credibility
issues
were
determined.
judge
brown
in
his
dissent,
i
believe,
makes
out
a
very
persuasive
case
sighting
a
--
a
whole
regime
of
cases
in
ohio.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
well,
i'm
impressed
by
with
--
with
judge
brown
is
the
authorities
that
he
assembled
in
his
dissent
from
the
highest
court
of
ohio
indicating
that
we
have
traditionally
in
the
state
on
matters
of
credibility
given
weight
to
the
trial
judge's
disposition
because
of
his
unique
position
to
make
that
judgment.
but,
your
honor,
i
really
don't
believe
in
a
sense
this
case,
you
know,
has
go
off
on
that
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
clearly
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
here
no
matter
how
you
examine
these
facts.
and
if
that
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
our
federal
constitutional
claim
is
we've
been
denied
equal
protection
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
we
were
--
we
were
singled
out
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
think
it
is
in
terms
of
the
burden
of
proof
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
your
honor.
i
think
the
two
rights
coincide.
our
substantive
right
is
one
of
equal
protection.
our
due
process
claim
is,
whether
or
not
when
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
says,
after
having
made
out
the
case
we
did
in
the
lower
court
that
we
were
obliged
to
bring
forward
the
officials
to
show
that
they
were
or
were
not
going
to
prosecute
the
other
magazines.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
what
i
think
we
have
is,
we
have
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court
where
you
have
given
great
weight
to
the
findings
of
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
think
the
same
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
forgive
me
but
i
don't
believe
there
should
be
any
difference
in
this
court
in
judging
the
fact
finding
process
of
the
district
court
or
of
a
state
trial
court.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me
just
say
this.
depending
on
your
disposition
on
that
issue,
my
view
is
that
the
wrong
rule
was
applied
here
and
--
and
i'd
like
to
address
that.
it
seems
to
me
when
you
have
a
case
of
this
kind
where
a
monopoly
of
the
evidence
exists
with
the
government
as
in
the
prosecutorial
vindictiveness
in
these
cases
and
in
the
exclusion
of
cognizable
minority
groups
from
juries,
this
court
has
set,
dealing
both
with
state
cases
and
with
federal
cases
that
a
different
rule
has
to
be
applied.
obviously,
in
these
cases,
the
defendant
displaced
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
in
terms
of
trying
to
--
we
never
had
any
expectation
for
one
moment
in
this
case
that
my
cross-examination
would
cause
mr.
tailor
to
break
down
and
say,
“yes.
yes.
i
did
it.”
this
was
a
selective
prosecution.
in
every
case,
it
has
come
to
this
court
or
has
come
to
these
circuit
courts
under
selective
prosecution,
it
is
understandable
that
the
prosecutor
who
bears
the
responsibility
for
this
act
has
taken
a
defensive
posture
and
has
explained
a
way
the
reason
if
it
seems
to
me
if
--
if
this
case
were
to
survive
every
single
selective
prosecution
case
in
the
country
could
be
defeated
by
the
prosecutor
saying,
well
this,
we
decided
this
was
a
test
case.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
of
course,
your
honor,
of
course.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
welcomed
that
question
in
atlanta,
georgia,
and
the
case
decided
in
the
prosecutor's
brief
where
they
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
made
a
judgment
in
atlanta,
georgia.
this
case
reached
the
fifth
circuit.
they
made
out
a
judgment
that
they
were
going
to
proceed
against
the
so-called
“sophisticated
men's
magazines”
to
put
it
as
gracefully
as
i
can.
and
there,
they
--
they
went
after
five
or
six
and
many
of
those,
your
honor,
were
out
of
state,
a
--
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
all
out
of
state.
they
were
going
to
use
their
expedition
powers
to
bring
all
those
of
publishers
into
the
state
and
they
prosecuted
penthouse,
they
prosecuted
hustler,
they
prosecuted
playboy,
they
prosecuted
club
magazine
and
a
number
of
others.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
absolutely.
there's
no
question
about
it,
your
honor,
and
what
i
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
what
is
wrong
with
it
is
here,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
inherently
a
suspect.
let's
look
at
the
facts.
they
acknowledge
--
the
prosecutor
acknowledges
that
he
stated
on
public
television
that
this
case
is
being
prosecuted
because
of
political
cartoon.
we
know
that
the
--
the
initial
investigation
was
launched
by
the
cartoon
because
of
complaints
that
were
made
against
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
more
than
coincidental,
at
that
point
after
hustler
has
been
in
that
community
for
two
years,
they've
had
550
obscenity
prosecution,
not
one
has
ever
involved
the
sophisticated
men's
magazine.
and
all
of
a
sudden,
coincidentally
with
that,
they
make
a
judgment
that
we
are
going
to
proceed
against
hustler
on
obscenity
ground.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
because
that's
what
inspired
the
prosecution,
your
honor,
i
say
in
all
difference
to
the
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no,
your
honor.
they
--
they
--
what
the
highest
court
of
ohio
said
was
this,
“it
is
conceited
that
hustler
was
selected.”
so,
under
the
two
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
what
i
--
what
--
your
honor,
i
welcome
that
question
because
i
think
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
issue
here,
and
let
me
deal
with
it.
it
seems
to
me
under
the
well-established
law,
we
have
to
satisfy
two
branches
of
the
test
that's
been
fixed
by
this
court
and
other
courts.
one
is,
that
we've
been
singled
out
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that's
been
conceited
by
everyone
because
they
didn't
prosecute
any
other
magazines.
now,
the
--
the
hard
part
of
the
case
is,
did
they
single
us
out
for
an
impermissible
reason?
we
have
prima
facie
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
the
cartoon.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no,
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
and
let
me
try
to
make
myself
clear
to
you.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
magazine
can
be
salvaged
on
obscenity
grounds
because
of
that
cartoon.
what
i'm
saying
is,
where
it
is
clear
from
the
evidence
that
the
pros
--
at
least
the
investigation
was
initiated
by
that
cartoon,
this
court
has
to
take
a
hard
look
at
a
--
a
retraction
of
that.
and
at
the
hearing
when
obviously,
you
have
an
issue
now
in
an
adversary
forum
where
the
prosecutor
comes
in
and
says,
“well,
that
really
wasn't
our
reason
that
we
decided
to
make
a
test
case
of
this.”
the
other
thing
i
would
urge
upon
this
court
is
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me
the
doctrine
of
selective
prosecution
would
become
a
myth.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
the
rule
that
i
would
like
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i'm
sorry.
i
was
going
to
do
that.
i
think
the
fourth
case
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
judge,
there
is
no
case
indirectly
in
point
in
this
court.
what
you
have
done
is
in
this
court
under
yick
wo,
oiler,
and
two
guys,
you
have
a
established
the
substantive
rules.
now,
i
didn't
mean
to
evade
your
question.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
never
addressed
what
i
consider
to
be
the
primary
issue
of
the
procedure,
the
implementing
of
the
rule.
after
you
announced
the
rule
in
exclusion
of
cognizable
groups
of
minorities,
you
had
a
substantive
principle.
in
castaneda,
you
then
had
to
decide
how
are
we
going
to
implicate
this
because
what
had
happened
is,
jury
commissioners
were
coming
in
to
the
courts
and
saying,
“we
never
had
any
intent
to
exclude
mexicans
or
--
or
blacks.”
and
in
--
what
i
consider
to
be
a
critically
important
footnote
in
castaneda,
footnote
number
19,
the
court
said
and
--
and
the
language
is
important
enough
that
i
just
recited
to
you,
it's
very
short.
what
you
said
is
--
this
is
not
to
say
of
course
to
the
simple
protest
station
from
a
commissioner
that
racial
considerations
played
no
part
and
the
selection
would
be
enough.
this
kind
of
testimony
has
been
found
insufficient
in
several
cases.
neither
is
the
state
entitled
to
a
--
to
rely
on
a
presumption
that
officials
discharge
their
sworn
duties
to
rebut
the
case
of
discrimination.
there
you
have
in
that
instance,
plaintiffs,
who
have
shown
a
discrimination
against
a
--
a
cognizable
minority
group.
the
commissioners
come
in
just
like
the
--
the
u.s.
attorney
of
the
--
the
prosecutor
does
here
and
says,
“we
never
intended
that
and
that
it's
not
our
purpose
to
--
to
--
to
discriminate
against
mexicans.”
and
this
court
has
said
that
because
of
the
unique
circumstances
of
those
cases,
we
are
going
to
require
a
heavier
burden
of
proof
and
they
will
have
to
produce
more.
in
blackledge
versus
perry,
and
--
and,
your
honor,
perhaps
i
should
have
responded
by
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
--
i
can't
say
that
in
good
conscience,
your
honor,
but
what
i
can
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
you
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
--
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
he
would.
and
to
the
extent
that
he
was
very
much
offended
by
the
cartoon,
yes,
he
would
be
prejudiced
against
my
client.
i
have
no
doubt.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
there
--
it's
--
it's
a
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
what
protects
this
is,
your
honor,
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
the
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
am,
your
honor,
but
what
you
have
is
it
seems
to
me
is
a
--
a
coalescence
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
equal
protection.
but
the
impermissible
basis
for
prosecuting
is,
is
the
first
amendment.
we
--
we
are
engaged
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
you're
honor
i
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
you
honor,
i
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
could
only
answer
that
by
saying
that
then
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the
--
the
doctrine
of
selected
prosecution
should
be
abolished.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
no,
but,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
if
it
please
you,
we
have,
growing
up
beneath
you,
in
the
circuit
courts
fault,
you
know,
steele,
where
they
went
after
draft
protesters.
and
the
courts
have
found
--
even
though
the
prosecutors
came
in
and
said,
“look,
we're
making
a
test
case
of
this”,
they
said,
"but
you've
picked
a
man
here
because
he
was
very
active
in
advocating
non-registration
for
draft.
in
--
in
the
steele
case,
you
have
another
protester.
in
the
crowder's
case
here
in
this
very
city
where
they
occupied
the
halls
of
congress
and
they
had
never
prosecuted
anybody
that
had
--
had
applauded
the
administration,
they
went
after
only
those
that
were
critical
of
the
administration.
you
said
that
this
was
a
selective
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
you
did
but
i
would
hope
you'll
put
it.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes,
yes.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
you
honor,
it
would
be
selective
but
it
might
be
justifiable.
in
other
words,
they
may
not
have
used
an
impermissible
standard.
what
i'm
suggesting
in
this
case,
and
i
wanted
to
reach
this
with
the
court
because
i
think
it's
terribly
important,
you
understand
that
what
we
are
faced
here
in
this
case,
which
i
think
presents
a
terrible
threat
to
the
whole
doctrine
of
selective
prosecution,
is
a
situation
without
one
single
bit
of
corroborative
evidence,
without
any
criteria
at
all,
without
any
suggestion
that
we
had
a
meeting,
and
we
decided
to
go
against
hustler,
without
any
proof
that
we
collected
other
magazines
and
then
we
made
a
decision
that
hustler
was
the
worst
magazine,
without
a
memorandum,
without
a
report
or
anything
after
this
claim
was
brought,
and
after
hustler
is
the
only
magazine
a
prosecutor
simply
takes
the
stand,
and
i
hope
my
comments
don't
lack
diplomacy,
but
i
--
i
would
be
a
coward
if
i
didn't
say
this,
a
prosecutor
takes
the
stand
and
simply
says,
“
well,
you
never
incidentally,
never
in
the
hearing
does
he
utter
the
word
'test
case'.”
what
he
says
is,
“we
were
considering
maybe
going
after
the
other
magazines
once
the
hustler
prosecution
was
concluded.”
now,
you
may
find
what
that
implies,
he's
talking
about
a
test
case.
but
i
come
back
to
this
issue
and
--
and
i
--
i
challenge
that
the
--
my
--
my
brothers
to
answers
this.
if
this
were
the
law
in
the
context
of
this
case
right
now,
would
you
all
agree
with
me
that
any
selective
prosecution
claim
could
be
defeated?
could
be
defeated
by
simply
a
prosecutor
taking
the
stand
and
saying,
“this
is
a
test
case”?
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
significantly,
none
have
been
prosecuted,
but
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
judge,
if
they
had
prosecuted,
your
honor
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
you
mean
right
this
minute?
if
they
had
so
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
would
think
that
would
--
that
would
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
do
not
believe
it
would
solve
the
problem,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
because
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
if
they
have
done
that
after
this
case
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
add
greatly
to
their
case
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
posture
we're
in
here
is
that
the
facts
are
fairly
well
fixed.
i
think
our
concern
always
is
what
they
do
in
retrospect
can
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
simply
trying
to
defeat
the
claim.
but,
your
honor,
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
to
you
and
acknowledge
that
if
right
after
the
flynt
prosecution,
they
had
gone
out,
even
after
the
claim
have
been
brought
to
their
attention
and
charged
five
or
six
other
men's
magazines,
it
would
--
it
would
well
be
that
we
wouldn't
be
in
this
court
today.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
of
course.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
proportions
of
reach,
i
mean
if
they
go
after
five
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
don't
think
that's
under
selective
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
the
--
the
doctrine
of
selective
prosecution
seems
to
militate
against
that,
your
honor.
obviously,
the
rule
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
--
in
response
to
judge
rehnquist's
question,
the
case
of
blackledge
versus
perry,
which
is
a
prosecutorial
vindictiveness
case
is
in
the
close
neighborhood
of
what
we're
talking
about
here.
and
the
court
there
said,
“this
court
went
further
than
the
circuits
did
in
falk,
steel,
crowders
and
burrows
by
holding
that
due
process
is
violated
where
there
is
prosecutorial
opportunity
for
vindictiveness,
even
when
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
prosecutor
acted
in
bad
faith,
or
maliciously.
what
i'm
urging
by
analogy
is,
in
a
very
close
situation
where
you
have
prosecutorial
vindictiveness
rather
than
selectivity,
and
i
see
them
closely
aligned,
this
court
recognizing
the
difficult
of
--
difficulty
of
proof
that
the
defendant
has
says,
in
those
cases,
if
there's
appearance
of
vindictiveness,
and
opportunity
for
vindictiveness,
then
a
very
--
heavy
burden
shifts
to
the
government,
to
come
forward.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
no,
your
honor.
because
first
of
all,
he's
the
only
one
that
has
committed
in
murder
so
he
hasn't
been
selected
out,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
what
i'm
saying
is,
your
honor,
i
assume
he
had
been
properly
connected
with
the
murder.
but
secondly,
it
would
seem
to
that
the
--
we
have
to
evaluate
whether
it
was
from
impermissible
or
an
unconstitutional
purpose.
and
--
and
what
we're
saying
here
in
this
case
is,
that
if
--
if
we
have
evident
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
in
your
example,
you've
given,
your
honor?
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
just
am
--
i'm
critical
of
the
fashion
which
the
--
i
think,
your
honor,
rightly
or
wrongly,
that
these
procedures
represent
a
very
real
threat
to
the
first
amendment.
i
--
i
--
it's
a
matter
of
record,
your
honor,
that
the
minute
this
prosecution
was
initiated
against
mr.
flynt,
the
major
distributor
in
that
community
would
not
longer
handle
those
magazines.
the
prosecutor
wrote
him
and
said,
“we
are
considering,
starting
a
criminal
action
against
him,
and
if
we
do,
will
you
discontinue
handling
this
magazine?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
and
so
the
minute
the
action
was
started,
george
klein,
the
major
distributor
in
cleveland,
no
longer
handled
it.
this
court
has
always
been
extremely
sensitive
to
the
chilling
effect
of
prosecutions
of
this
kind
which
involve
the
distribution
of
magazines
which
are
presumably
protected.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
know
why
the
unbroken
series
of
cases
that
stretched
over
the
long
history
of
this
court
that
have
always
held
postulate
that
where
you
have
a
restraint,
a
prior
restraint
of
the
nature
you
have
here
that
comes
to
this
court,
it
comes
bearing
a
presumption
of
unconstitutionality.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes
sir.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
think
that's
an
excellent
question,
your
honor,
and
i
welcome
it.
i
think
what
we
really
should
have
had
is
number
one,
he
should
have
called
his
superiors
in
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
but
at
the
end,
you
said
you
did,
your
honor.
now,
i
find
that
an
inconsistency.
you
remember
at
the
beginning,
he
says
he's
in
charge,
but
at
the
very
end
he
said,
“well,
he
have
to
check
with
the
superiors
that
--
the
other
magazines.”
now,
for
some
reason,
the
supreme
court
--
and
i
--
i
consider
this
terribly
important
procedurally,
the
supreme
court
said
the
reason
we
failed
in
making
out
our
prima
facie
case
is
that
we
should
have
brought
those
persons
in
from
the
prosecutor's
office
and
put
them
on
the
stand
and
inquired
of
them.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
what
would
i
do
is,
i
would
say,
“has
there
been
any
consideration
given
to
these
other
magazines?”
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
but,
your
honor,
what
he
said
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
--
because
as
they
concede
on
their
brief,
they
were
mistaken
when
they
said
they
couldn't
bring
people
in
from
out
of
state.
the
extradition
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
--
i
believe
it
is
23
--
2903
of
the
state
of
ohio
law
says
that
--
29-6301
through
29-6329
provides
that
they
can
extradite
for
misdemeanors.
so
that,
he
was
mistaken
in
that
--
in
that
assumption,
so
he
could
have
gone
after
all
of
the
sophisticated
men's
magazine
and
brought
all
of
the
people
in
from
out-of-state.
but
your
honor,
the
point
i
make
is,
it
seems
to
me
the
very
least
we're
entitled
to
is
some
corroboration
of
a
meaning,
of
a
discussion
about
evaluating
these
other
magazines
and
the
purchase
of
those
magazines,
the
police
officers
went
out
and
got
penthouse
these
other
magazines,
brought
them
in;
and
they
had
said,
“we
made
a
decision
that
hustler
is
the
magazine
we're
going
to
go
after,”
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
may
well
admit
their
burden.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
i
--
judge,
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well
i
--
i
read
that
into
--
and
again,
your
honor,
i'm
very
impressed
with
the
falk
decision
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
where
they
say
that,
“once
--
in
a
first
amendment
case,
once
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
out,
the
evidence
must
be
compelling,
and
that
the
government
has
a
heavy
burden.”
and
i
think
that
implies
more
than
just
a
categorical
denial,
we
did
no
wrong.that
we
did
what
we
thought
was
right.
and,
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me,
again
--
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
in
this
area
where
you
are
involve
both
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
we're
in
a
federal
jurisdiction
or
in
a
state
jurisdiction.
i
would
see
this
court
handing
down
a
rule
that
would
govern
selective
prosecution,
both
in
state
courts
and
in
federal
courts.
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
but
let
me
just
end
this
note
at
the
risk
of
being
repetitive.
i
think
the
--
the
matter
of
the
court
should
be
the
most
concerned
about
is,
if
this
selective
prosecution
were
to
be
sustained
on
the
record
is
below,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
will
have
done
irreparable
damage
to
that
doctrine
if
it
is
to
survive
and
remain
viable.
because
basically,
what
could
happen
in
any
selective
prosecution
across
the
country,
a
prosecutor
could
simply
come
in
and
say,”
one,
we
never
intended
to
discriminate
against
this
defendant.
we
may
go
after
some
of
the
other
defendants
later
on.and
number
three,
we
view
this
as
test
case.”
if
that's
the
situation,
then
we
run
a
terrible
risk
of
every
single
selective
prosecution
being
defeated
and
that
the
doctrine
would
be
relegated
to
a
legal
museum.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
(voice
overlap)
your
honor,
thank
you.
i
wanted
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
what
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
said
at
the
very
end
of
the
case.
"for
purpose
of
this
motion,
the
court
is
limited
by
the
testimony
and
must
search
that
testimony
objectively
in
relationship
to
the
constitutional
guidelines
established
by
a
series
of
previous
judicial
decisions
on
the
discriminatory
prosecution
question.
and
it
is
this
court's
decision
that
the
testimony
supports
the
allegations
of
the
defendant.”
so,
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
language
can
be
interpreted
albeit
--
albeit
a
very
short
decision
that
the
judge
did
make
a
finding,
a
fact-finding,
a
--
a
decision
that
the
testimony
in
general
supported
our
claim.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
herald
price
fahringer
well,
your
honor,
i
would
like
believe
--
and
again,
i
apologize
for
disagreeing
with
you
that
i
think
when
the
--
in
--
in
the
dissent
when
they
say
we
have
always
given
great
weight
to
the
--
the
trier
of
the
fact,
and
--
and
this
court
too
has
given
great
weight
to
the
trier
of
the
fact
in
the
past,
i
think
that
should
be
done
here.
last,
let
me
just
say
this,
if
it
is
part
of
the
reason,
if
the
first
amendment
implications
are
part
of
the
reason
for
prosecuting
the
magazine,
then
it
seems
to
me
there
has
to
be
a
much
more
in-depth
inquiry
than
we
had
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
test
case
or
not.
once
the
concession
is
made
that
it
was
part
of
the
reason
why
we
went
after
this
magazine,
then
i
don't
think
it's
sufficient
simply
to
label
it
a
test
case,
but
that
there
should
be
some
corroboration
of
it
being
a
test
case.
thank
you.
