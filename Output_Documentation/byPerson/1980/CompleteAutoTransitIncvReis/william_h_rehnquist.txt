justice
rehnquist
but
in
our
boeing
decision
of
some
years
ago,
didn't
we
say
that
it
wasn't
up
of
the
nlrb
to
decide
whether
the
fines
levied
by
a
union
on
members
who
crossed
a
picket
line
were
unreasonable
or
not,
that
that
was
an
action
that
would
have
to
be
brought
in
a
state
court?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think
that's
universally
true
of
every
conceivable
dispute.
justice
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
sued
in
the
federal
district
court
under
diversity
of
citizenship
and
alleged
more
than
$10,000
in
damages
and
said
this
was
a
breach
of
contract
on
the
part
of
these
particular
individuals?
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
thrown
out?
justice
rehnquist
why
couldn't
they
have
applied
that
in
the
diversity
case?
justice
rehnquist
if
you
have...
if
a
producer
has
a
contract
with
ingrid
bergman
and
she
walks
off
honoring
a
no
strike
clause,
to
discharge
her
is
exactly
what
she
wants.
damages
is
really
the
producer's
only
remedy
for
redress.
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
grossman,
what
if
a
producer
had
a
contract
with
ingrid
bergman
and
she
walked
off
the
lot
honoring
a
no
strike
clause,
or
a
sympathy
strike,
or
something
like
that,
and
do
you
say
that
there
would
be
no
action
even
in
diversity
in
a
federal
court
against
her
for
damages?
justice
rehnquist
yes,
that
she's
a
member
of
the
screen
actors'
guild.
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
the
congress
affirmatively
prohibited
damages
by
simply
conferring
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts
under
301?
justice
rehnquist
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
language
of
301?
justice
rehnquist
that
a
party
whose
agent
negotiates
an
agreement
for
them
is
not
subject
to
damages?
justice
rehnquist
it
didn't
want
to
make
employees
irresponsible.
justice
rehnquist
but
why
aren't
they
subject
to
damages
the
way
any
other
person
signing
an
employment
contract
is?
justice
rehnquist
does
an
employee
have
a
right
to
sue
in
a
federal
district
court,
not
under
301,
but
under
diversity
jurisdiction,
an
employer
for
breach
of
his
contract
and
and
allege
damages?
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
grossman,
is
your
basic
argument
that
there
is
no
301
jurisdiction
in
federal
courts
for
this
kind
of
an
action,
or
that
this
kind
of
an
action
simply
cannot
be
brought
because
congress
has
prohibited
imposing
liability
on
individual
members?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
so
your
argument
is
basically,
no
301
jurisdiction,
not
that
if
there
were
diversity
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
court?
which
there
wasn't
here,
but
might
be
in
some
other
cases,
that
federal
substantive
law
prohibits
the
maintenance
of
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
explain
smith
v.
evening
news,
then?
justice
rehnquist
whether
under
301,
or
whether
in
state
court,
or
whether
in
federal
court,
or?
justice
rehnquist
then
that's
as
true
of
ingrid
bergman
who
may
have
damaged
the
employer
by
$2
million
or
$3
million,
as
by
someone
who
quits
voluntarily
and
can
easily
be
replaced?
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
is
a
hypothetical.
the
assumption
is
that
she
is,
and
then
your
answer's
the
same.
justice
rehnquist
as
i
recall
the
taft-hartley
provision,
one
of
them
was
to
say
that
no
worker
should
be
penalized
for
engaging
or
for
not
engaging
in
collective
activity.
and
yet
your
construction
of
301
would
immunize
workers
who
worked
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
obtained
by
collective
activity
from
any
damage
remedy.
whereas
a
single
worker
who
signed
an
agreement
to
work
would
be
liable.
