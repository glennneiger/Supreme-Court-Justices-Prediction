justice
white
well,
does
petitioner,
your
client,
concede...
or
does
it?
that
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law?
justice
white
governed
by
the
federal
labor
law?
justice
white
and
i
suppose
it
is
true
that
if
the
union
had
been
liable
in
the
case,
the
individuals
would
not
have
been?
justice
white
now,
is
that...
do
you
really
mean
that,
or
is
it
that
you
mean
just
that
a
judgment
against
the
union
can't
be
collected
from
the?
justice
white
no,
i
didn't,
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is,
suppose
that
the
union
was
liable
in
this
case.
suppose
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
union
could
be
sued
for
violating
the
no
strike
clause.
justice
white
could
the
employer
also
sue
with
the
union
the
employees?
justice
white
but
would
you
just
say,
would
you
say
that
the...
you
say
that
if
the
union
were
liable,
the
employees,
the
action
against
the
employees
should
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action?
justice
white
well,
if
you
say
it,
if
the
federal
law
covers
it
and
there's
no
cause
of
action
against
the
employees
that's
the
answer,
and
if
that's
your
relief,
that
would
be
true
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
under
301
or
not.
justice
white
and
if
you
suggest
that
if
you
brought
a
cause
of
action
against
the
union
and
the
employees
together,
claiming
the
union
is
responsible
and
that
the
employees
are
responsible
too,
you
told
me
a
minute
ago
that
the
employees
should
be
dismissed
from
the
suit
if
the
union
is
liable.
justice
white
and
you
wouldn't
suggest
then
that
you
could
turn
around
and
sue
them
in
state
court?
justice
white
well,
could
i
ask
you,
is
it
clear
under
the
lower
court
cases...
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
a
case...
that
the
employer,
if
the
strike
is
still
going
on,
a
wildcat
strike
is
still
going
on,
may
the
employer
enjoin
the
wildcatters
themselves?
justice
white
how
about
the
lower
courts?
justice
white
under
301?
justice
white
under
301
and
saying
that
the
contract
is
enforceable
against
the
individuals?
justice
white
it
was
moot.
justice
white
but
it
would
be
the
same
question
of
federal
law.
justice
white
well,
you're
conceding
away
the
jurisdictional
point
that
the
federal
courts
set--
--which
is
the
only
point
here,
isn't
it?
well,
you're
not
conceding
the
cause
of
action?
justice
white
otherwise
you
would
be
out
of
our--
--well,
the
reason
he
could
go
into
federal
court
and
get
an
injunction
is
that
boys
market
held
that
he
could,
if
what
he
had
was
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
agreement.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
you...
in
the
smith
and
lucas,
those
kinds
of
suits
in
a
state
court,
under
301,
they
are
governed
by
federal
law.
justice
white
and
i
don't
suppose
you
could
get
a
remedy
in
a
state
court
that,
for
example,
against
a
union
that
carbon
fuel
said
you
couldn't
get?
justice
white
yes.
so,
your
real
submission,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
under
the
federal
law
damage
recoveries
from
individual
employees
are
simply
forbidden.
there's
just
no
cause
of
action
against
them
for
that.
justice
white
well,
was
there
ever
any
decision
or
any
claim
that
the
union
couldn't
have
been
liable
even
if
the
employees
were?
justice
white
was
there
ever
a
decision
by
a
court
that
the
union
couldn't
have
been
liable
in
all
cases?
justice
white
because
certainly
atkinson
v.
sinclair
said
you
can't
avoid
301(b)
by
just
suing
the
employees,
if
the
union
is
liable.
justice
white
well,
why
don't
you...
why
isn't,
why
aren't
you
arguing...
maybe
you
are...
that
you
really
can't
tell,
at
least
you
can't
hold
the
employees
liable,
until
it's
been
legally
determined
that
the
union
is
not
liable?
justice
white
because
if
it
is,
atkinson
v.
sinclair
says
301(b)
bars
it.
justice
white
well,
they
can't
elect...
atkinson
says
you
just
can't
elect
to
sue
employees.
justice
white
you
couldn't
have
had
judgment
against
both
of
them?
justice
white
under
301(b)?
justice
white
and,
or,
and
the
employer
could
have
said,
could
have
said,
well,
we
think
they're
both
liable,
but
if
the
union
isn't,
certainly
the
employees
are.
justice
white
exactly.
well,
how
do
we
know
whether
the
union
would
ever
have
been
liable
or
not?
justice
white
well,
is
that...
do
you
think
that's
tantamount
to
admitting
the
union
was
not
liable?
justice
white
i
think
the...
i
see
a
recitation
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
the
district
court
actually
found
that
the
union
had
not
authorized
the
strike.
