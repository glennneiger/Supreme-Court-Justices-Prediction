justice
jr.
well,
i
gather
though
the
statutes,
the
genesis,
initially,
was
that
there
wasn't
any
way
previously
of
suing
unions.
justice
jr.
and
301
was
enacted
so
that
unions
might
be
made
subject
to
suits.
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but...
it
may
not
have
been
the
only
one,
but
was
there
one
that
individual
employees
should
be
subject
to
suits?
justice
jr.
was
one
of
the
reasons
to
make
individual
employees
alleged
to
have
violated
collective
bargaining
agreements
subject
to
suits?
justice
jr.
now,
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
danbury
hatters
case,
wasn't
there?
justice
jr.
but
that
the
union,
as
union,
could
not
be
held
responsible?
justice
jr.
that's
right.
justice
jr.
but
did
you
get
those
injunctions
in
the
context
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
arbitration
clauses?
justice
jr.
not
otherwise?
justice
jr.
and
in
a
federal
district
court?
justice
jr.
under
301?
justice
jr.
buffalo
forge's
case?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
yes.
and
only
then.
justice
jr.
otherwise
section
4
of
norris-la
guardia
would
bar
you
just
as
much--
justice
jr.
may
i
ask,
isn't
there
some
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
the
sanction
should
be
limited
to
discharge
or
other
discipline
than
damages?
justice
jr.
and
you
think
that's...
it's
limited
to
that,
or
something?
justice
jr.
mr.
grossman,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
what
the
statute
says
is,
jurisdiction
is
conferred
on
district
courts
of
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
concluded
as
the
result
of
collective
bargaining
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce.
and
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
suit
which
is
maintainable
under
that
language,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
that's
what
i
say,
is
it...
it's
a
question
of
construction
of
that
language,
isn't
it?
justice
jr.
cannot
be
construed
to
authorize
a
suit
of
this
kind
or
confer
jurisdiction
over--
justice
jr.
--now,
that's
what
you
have
to
persuade
us,
isn't
it?
may
i
just
add
one
question?
is
it
not
also
true
that
if
301
does
not
authorize
this
suit,
then
the
suit
may
not
go
forward,
because
there's
no
other
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
here?
justice
jr.
did
the
injunction
in
boys
market
run
against
the
employees
as
well
as
the
union?
do
you
remember?
justice
jr.
against
both?
justice
jr.
so
to
that
extent
we
have
recognized
that
there
is
a
301
action
against
the
employees.
justice
jr.
how
did
the
international
and
the
local
drop
out
of
the
case?
justice
jr.
proceed
only
against
the
employees?
