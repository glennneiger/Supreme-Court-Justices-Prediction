justice
stevens
well,
mr.
hunter,
what
if
you
had
an
insolvent
union?
why
couldn't
you
sue
the
employees
directly
under
your
theory?
justice
stevens
but
the
individuals
also
have
violated
the
contract
under
your
theory?
justice
stevens
well,
don't
you
have
a
remedy
in
the
state
court?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
stevens
yes.
well,
why
wouldn't
there
be,
if
federal
law
is
simply
nonexistent,
then
there
would
no
barrier
to
a
state
law,
if
you
have...
isn't
that
right?
justice
stevens
--could
i
just
ask
you
a
question
that's
running
through
my
mind?
justice
stevens
there
are
two
remedies
available
when
the
employee
breaches
a
contract.
one,
you
can
get
an
injunction
requiring
him
to
go
back
to
work.
and
secondly,
you
can
discharge
him.
those
are
both
remedies.
justice
stevens
well,
perhaps
sometimes
the
injunctive
remedy
is
not
available.
the
discharge
remedy
is
always
available.
justice
stevens
now,
on
the
damage
remedy
that
you
asked
the
judiciary
to
invent,
what
is
the
measure
of
damages?
justice
stevens
loss
of
profits
to
the
company?
justice
stevens
is
there
a
body
of
law
that
tells
us
that
that
would
be
the
measure
of
damages?
justice
stevens
i'm
going
to
ask
a
question,
that's
the
next
question
down
the
road,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
well,
there
are
not
many
suits
by
employers
against
employees
generally,
is
there?
justice
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
what
your--
justice
stevens
--i
understand.
justice
stevens
sometimes,
you
know,
there
are
different
contract
damage
rules,
whether
it
was
in
the
contemplation
of
the
parties,
and
loss
of
profits,
a
lot
of
different...
i
know
you
don't
have
a
theory
yet
as
what
damage
recovery
would
be?
justice
stevens
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
it's
01
prohibits
the
suit.
we
just
have
to
first
decide
whether
it
authorizes
a
suit.
justice
stevens
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
justice
stevens
and
whether
they
could
sue
in
a
state
court
or
sue
ingrid
bergman
would
be
in
another
lawsuit,
not
this
one.
well,
mr.
grossman,
on
that
other
thing
you're
saying
that
the
remedy
is
to
discharge?
