mr.
r.
ian
hunter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
submitted
to
the
court
in
this
case
is
limited
to
a
determination
whether
individual
employees
who
engage
in
a
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
who
acted
without
the
authorization
of
their
labor
organization
are
responsible
for
damages
sustained
by
their
employer
and
liable
to
it
arising
out
of
their
individualized
breach
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
i
might
note
that
it
would
appear
that
is
the
very
issue
reserved
by
this
court
in
its
decision
of
atkinson
v.
sinclair
refining.
i
think
a--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
a
brief
recitation
of
the
facts,
i
think,
are
important
to
a
determination
of
this
issue.
in
june
of
1967
the
respondent
employees
engaged
in
a
work
stoppage
against
the
three
petitioners
for
up
to
and
including
two
weeks
in
time.
now,
petitioners
alleged
and
respondents
admit
that
at
no
time
did
their
labor
organization,
aid,
abet,
condone,
or
authorize
this
work
stoppage,
that
this
was
indeed
an
individual
action
on
their
part.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i'm
equating
it
to
the
violation
of
the
agreement
that
contained
a
no
strike
clause.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
well,
i
can't
involve
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
without
acknowledging
the
role
of
the
union,
but
i
do
know
that
the
no
strike
clause
should
be
equally
enforceable
against
the
employees
as
well
as
the
union.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
to
the
degree
that
they
signed
a
no
strike
clause,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
petitioner
employers
now
attempt
to
hold
these
employees
responsible
for
the
damages
directly
resulting
from
their
individualized
breaches
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
pursuant
to
this
lawsuit
brought
in
accordance
with
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
now,
although
301
on
its
face
contemplates
suits
alleging
violation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
petitioner
concedes
that
the
language
does
not
expressly
address
the
issue
of
individual
liability
arising
out
of
those
violations.
a
review
of
relevant
congressional
history,
in
the
opinion
of
petitioners,
indicates
that
congress
did
not
specifically
authorize
or
prohibit
such
actions
against
individual
employees,
when
their
conduct
was
not
authorized
by
their
local
unions.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
yes,
that
was
one
of
the
principal
concerns.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
that's
right.
that
was
one
of
the
principal
concerns.
that
was
one,
as
i
understand,
not
the
only
concern.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
was
there?
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
no,
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
specific
discussion
covering
that
subject
matter
in
the
taft-hartley.
the
purpose
of
the
taft-hartley,
as
i
understand
it,
and
in
reading
this
court's
decisions,
not
attempting
to
tell
you
what
you
meant,
but
attempting
to
read
as
what
i
understand
it
to
be,
is
that
section
301
was
intended
to
permit
the
enforcement
of
labor
agreements
against
labor
organizations,
as
pointed
out
by
justice
brennan;
to
hold
these
agreements
equally
binding
upon
all
parties
to
that
collective
bargaining
agreement;
to
foster
a
collective
bargaining
process
as
the
desired
method
of
resolving
industrial
disputes
in
this
country.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
there
was,
particularly
in
the
case
bill
and
to
some
degree
as
it
related
to
section
301(b).
now,
there
was
indeed
some
congressional
concern
about
that,
but
petitioners
respectfully
suggest
that
the
facts
confronting
the
court
in
this
issue
are
considerably
different
and
not
analogous
to
danbury
hatters.
as
i
understand
danbury
hatters
it
was
a
decision
which
arose
out
of
a
consumer
or
secondary
boycott
by
the
hatters'
union
against
danbury
hatters.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
members
of
the
union
who
were
ultimately
held
responsible
for
damages
may
or
may
not
have
known
of
the
actions
of
their
union.
it
was
a
consumer
boycott.
but
by
their
association
with
the
union
the
court
held
that
they
were
responsible
for
the
damages
imposed
by
the
union.
and
this
was
the
spectrum--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--no,
the
union
could
have
been
held
responsible
but
in
that
time
they
couldn't
have
because
it
was
under
court
abridged
association;
right.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
and
therefore
they
had
to
go
to
the
employees
to
seek
the
assets
to
fulfill
for
damage
remedies.
congress
was
concerned
about
that
and
sought
in
301(b)
specific
language
which
said
that
a
damage
judgment
against
unions
is
not
to
be
held...
the
individuals
are
not
to
be
held
responsible.
and
we
are
not
attempting
by
this
decision
to
invade
that,
or
this
court's
prior
decision
in
atkinson
v.
sinclair.
but
we
are
addressing
another
issue.
now,
respondent
and
amicus,
we
believe,
erroneously
attempt
to
convert
some
legislative
history
dealing
with
the
case
bill
as
dispositive
of
the
present
issue.
and
in
that
sense
they
attempt
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
case
bill
discussions,
which
did
deal
with
the
issue
of
discipline
being
the
sole
remedy
available
to
employers
in
an
unauthorized
strike,
is
applicable
to
the
taft-hartley
bill.
and
i
direct
the
congress's
discussion
as
to
10(d)
of
the
case
bill
as
the
points
in
question
that
respondent
attempts
to
emphasize.
they
contend
that
this
language
and
the
congressional
discussion
attendant
to
this
language
provides
a
basis
for
the
premise
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
discipline
should
be
the
sole
remedy
available
to
the
employer.
i
believe
these
arguments
avoid
two
very
significant
facts.
one,
the
provisions
of
10(d)
of
the
case
bill
did
not
survive
the
taft-hartley
and,
in
fact,
show
up
only
briefly
in
the
early
days
of
the
taft-hartley
and
disappear
inexplicably.
and
we
can't
find
out
why,
in
reading
the
congressional
history,
but
it
disappeared.
and
the
discussion
relied
upon
by
the
respondents
as
well
as
the
three
circuit
courts
which
have
discussed
this
matter,
do
not
recognize
that
this
discussion
was
not
repeated,
it
was
not
an
integral
part
of
the
congressional
history
of
the
taft-hartley.
effort
to
impose
upon
the
taft-hartley
the
meaning
of
a
provision
not
included
within
it
seems
to
be
erroneous
in
the
opinion
of
petitioners.
moreover,
the
role
of
congressional
silence
as
the
adoption
of
a
controlling
rule
of
law
is
less
treacherous,
as
i
reflect
the
verbiage
of
this
court
in
boys
markets.
we
believe
that
more
dispositive
of
the
present
issue,
is
the
discussion
in
the
house
conference
report,
in
the
taft-hartley
itself,
where
the
house
rejected
the
senate's
proposed
unfair
labor
practice
involving
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
which
ostensibly
would
have
encompassed
a
violation
of
a
no
strike
clause;
omitted
that
provision,
in
deference
to
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
by
the
usual
processes
of
law,
a
principle
noted
by
this
court
in
dowd
box
and
reflected
in
the
house
conference
report,
no.
510,
p.
52.
petitioners
respectfully
submit
that
a
damage
remedy
against
the
provenl
violators
of
a
contract
certainly
is
more
consistent
with
the
usual
processes
of
law
than
the
total
absence
of
such
remedy
or
the
total
dependence
upon
a
disciplinary
device
which
is
suggested
by
the
courts,
the
circuit
courts
and
respondents.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
absolutely.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
absolutely.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
would
not
have;
exactly.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
no,
i
would
mean
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
such
that
given
your
carbon
fuel
decision,
there
would
be
no
way
that
petitioners
could
seek
to
hold
the
labor
organization
involved
here
liable.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
fine.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
would
suggest
that
301(b)
establishes
a
firmer
foundation
for
precluding
that
remedy
than
it
does
in
this
case.
the
union
itself
would
be
held
responsible
for
the
actions
of
its
members.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
yes.
yes,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
my
understanding
of
the
current
state
of
the
law,
when
the
union
can
be
held
responsible
for
its
actions.
it
is
the
principal
party
to
the
contract,
but
the
employees
must
be
viewed
as
party,
at
least
they
have
been
deemed
parties
for
purposes
of
enforcing
their
rights.
and
if
the
union
is
not
responsible
and
has
taken
whatever
action
it
felt
necessary
and
could
to
curtail
the
work
stoppage,
to
eliminate
the
work
stoppage,
where
else
would
the
employer
look
for
a
monetary
remedy?
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
again,
i
suppose
you
could
and
maybe
that's
the
next
step
in
this
development
of
the
law,
but,
seeing
as
the
union's
responsible
for
the
fact
that
it's
insolvent
is
merely
a
question
of
collection,
not
a
question
of
principle,
because
the--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--all
under
the
auspices
of
their
local
union,
their
exclusive
representative
for
that
purpose.
it's
where
they
avoid
that
device
along
with
a
no
strike
clause
that
i
feel
that
they
put
themselves
in
jeopardy
and
leaving
the
employer
without
a
remedy.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
that's
my
understanding;
we
do
not.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
the
federal
law
is
exclusive
under
301.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
the
state
court
maybe
at
that
point,
but
then,
say,
in
light
of
a
determination
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
against
employees
in
the
federal
law,
therefore
we
have
jurisdiction
and
we
could--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--then
i
would--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--well,
could
there
be
a
remedy
available
in
the
state
court
under
either
of
those
circumstances?
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
not
be,
and
the
other
one
there
might
be.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
exactly.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
that's
right.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
it
did,
but
i
don't
know
how
that
points
on
to
the
issue.
i
would
be
hard
pressed,
until
today,
to
argue
that
i
could
go
into
the
state
courts
seeking
remedies
of
damages
for
a
violation
of
a
no
strike
clause
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
in
interstate
commerce
and
not
be
told
that
i
have
to
deal
with
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
oh,
not
every
conceivable
item,
but
certainly
a
violation
of
a
no
strike
clause
would
be
one
of
those
i
would
assume
would
fall
within
that
area.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
that's
right.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
they
were,
for
example,
in
atkinson
v.
sinclair
refining
on
the
plea
that
they
were
agents
of
the
union.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
no,
i
certainly
would
not
at
this
point.
i
feel
i
am
limited
to
whatever
remedy
is
available
under
the
federal
law
at
this
point
in
the
development
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
and
the
problem
that
we
have
as
petitioners
is
that
we
don't
know
what
that
remedy
is
under
the
current
state
of
the
law.
in
the
context
of
the
absence
of
any
explicit
congressional
mandate,
and
at
best
an
ambiguous
congressional
history,
we
look
as
petitioners
to
the
language
of
this
court
to
determine
the
logic
of
our
suggested
remedy.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
which
has
resolved
that
issue.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
know
that
i
have
succeeded
in
enjoining
wildcatters
by
a
federal
district
court
injunction
but--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--and--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--for
example,
the
6th
circuit
in
this
case.
we
brought
this
issue
to
you.
they
also
determined
than
an
injunction
against
these
employees
was
forthcoming
except
that
by
the
time
the
injunction
was
issued
the--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--it
was
moot.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
yes.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
not
otherwise.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
in
a
federal
district
court;
yes.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
under
301.
additionally,
for
the
court's
benefit,
the
strike
began,
we
went
for
an
ex
parte,
it
was
denied,
we
went
for
a
hearing,
we
were
denied
the
injunction
because
the
lower
court
found
that
the
dispute
at
that
time
appeared
to
be
a
dispute--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--well,
it
was
in
the
sense
it
was
not
arbitrable.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
ultimately,
during
the
duration
of
the
strike,
the
issue
changed
and
was
enjoined
because
it
became
a
dispute
that
was
arbitrable.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
only.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
that's
right.
and
it
was
so
found,
barred
us
in
the
early
stages
of
that
strike.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
lincoln
mills
directs
that
the
lower
courts
fashion
a
body
of
substantive
federal
law
for
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
which
was
viewed
by
this
court
a
paramount
concern
of
congress.
the
court
recognized
that
the
act
itself
provided
some
specific
guidance.
other
problems,
admittedly,
were
within
the
penumbra
of
the
express
statutory
mandate.
this
court
envisioned
that
union
as
well
as
employee
should
be
bound
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
the
lower
courts
were
asked
to
look
at
the
policy
of
the
legislation
and
fashion
a
remedy
or
remedies
that
would
effectuate
that
policy,
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
degree
of
judicial
inventiveness
would
be
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
problem.
we
appealed
to
the
judicial
inventiveness
of
the
6th
circuit
and
were
told
that
the
remedy
we
sought
was
not
available.
we
suggest
that
that
was
an
error
on
the
part
of
the
6th
circuit
and
the
issue
was
framed
accordingly.
smith
v.
evening
news
brings
to
fruition
the
ability
of
employees,
ostensibly
those
same
employees
involved
in
this
work
stoppage,
to
enforce
their
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
to
bring
an
action
under
301
to
enforce
the
employer's
obligation
to
them,
whether
be
he
terminated
for
unjust
cause
or
whether
his
seniority
was
violated,
but
the
employer
is
expected
to
comply
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
if
the
union
doesn't
take
care
of
it,
the
employee
is
entitled
to
under
the
conditions
enunciated
by
this
court
in
its
vaca
v.
sipes
and
hines
v.
anchor
cases.
so
the
employee
is
clearly
made
a
party
for
enforcement
purposes
by
this
court,
i
think
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent,
and
as
this
case,
wherein
the
petitioner
seeks
to
allow
the
employer
to
enforce
a
right
afforded
it
by
its
employees
when
they
seek
to
ignore
both
the
contract
and
their
local
union.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
justice
stevens.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
they
are
available
within
the
limits
imposed
by
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
comply
with
its
decisions.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
were
unable
to
enjoin
the
strike
in
its
early
stages
even
though
it
was
ostensibly
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause
because
the
issue
was
viewed
not
arbitrable.
mr.
r.
ian

discharge;
it
should
be
always
available.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
the
measure
of
damages
would
be
the
proven
damages
as
sustained
by
the
employers
as
the
result
of
work
stoppage.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
loss
of
profits
based
upon
the
circumstances,
whatever
they
could
prove
were
damages.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
suspect
that
the
courts
would
have
to
revert
to
the
contract...
for
a
violation--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--that's
really
something
that
at
this
point...
there's
no
specific
difference
between
damages
for
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
otherwise,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
no,
there
are
not.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
but
there
are
against
local
unions.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
and
i
believe
they've

you
can
relate
as
to
proven
damages
as
a
result
of
proven
violations
that
occurred.
it
could
be
ordinary
contract
damages.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
do
not.
i
have
not
been
permitted
to
develop
the
theory
of
damages
because
the
action
was
dismissed
prior
to
any
deliberations.
mr.
r.
ian

in
the
damages?
yes.

of

i
believe,

mr.
r.
ian
hunter
most
of
whom,
as
i
understand
it,
knew
nothing
about
what
was
being
boycotted,
unlike
here
where
we
only
would
be
able
to
sustain
damages
against
those
individuals
who
knowingly
had
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
boys
markets,
the
next
in
this
court's
line
of
decision,
reflects
this
court's
recognition
of
the
vital
importance
of
the
no
strike
agreement
to
the
employer.
this
court
characterized
it
as
the
quid
pro
quo
upon
which
the
employer
agreed
to
submit
its
industrial
disputes
to
arbitration.
an
injunction
was
justified
by
this
court
to
enjoin
violation
of
that
important
provision.
and
it
recognized
in
boys
market
that
frequently
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
passage
of
labor
legislation
changes
to
a
degree
that
it
is
necessary
entirely
to
emphasize
remedies
and
impose
responsibilities
not
necessarily
contemplated
by
congress
at
the
time
that
they
passed
that
labor
legislation
in
question.
we
then
come
to
this
court's
decision
in
carbon
fuel
which
i
believe
puts
into
perspective
the
urgency
of
this
court's
decision
as
to
the
issue
submitted
today.
carbon
fuel
found
that
a
labor
organization
is
not
obligated
for
the
damages
imposed
by
people
acting
beyond
the
common
law
rule
of
agency
in
the
midst
of
a
violation
of
a
no
strike
clause.
that
puts
into
focus
the
atkinson
v.
sinclair
where
individuals
were
not
responsible
for
the
actions
of
their
union,
and
carbon
fuel
puts
into
the
law
that
unions
are
not
responsible
for
the
actions
of
individuals
not
acting
as
their
agents.
the
question
we
now
raise,
are
those
individuals
who
violate
that
contract
responsible
to
the
employer,
given
the
fact
that
the
labor
organization
is
not?
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
think
we
would
have
been
confronted
with
the
same
argument
i
am
now
confronted
with,
that
this
is
a
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
it
constitutes
part
of
the
lincoln
mills
substantive
federal
labor
law,
and
i
think
they
would
have
been
somewhat
justified...
i
think.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
well,
diversity,
i'd
have
trouble
getting
diversity
in
light
of
it's
a
michigan
corporation
suing
michigan
employees.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
think
so.
i'm
convinced
it
would
be.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
it
does
not--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--if
this
court's
decisions
were
like
that
very
dogma,
i
think
maybe
an
argument
could
be
based
on
that--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
the
absence
of
uniformity
in
an
area
very
closely
related
to
federal
labor
law
might
be--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--undesirable.
well,
one
comment
before...
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
that
respondents'
and
amicus's
contention
that
discharge
is
a
better
solution
and
a
better
deterrent
doesn't
really
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me.
discharge
has
been
viewed
by
many
as
industrial
capital
punishment
and
i
don't
think
the
employees
being
terminated
are
necessarily
going
to
find
their
relationship
with
their
employer
any
more
harmonious
than
if
they
were
being
subjected
to
a
lawsuit
merely
to
collect
those
damages
that
they
cost
the
employer.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
believe
it
was
senator
taft
that
even
suggested
that
in
some
of
his
dialogue
that
after
all,
if
an
employee
quits,
he's
quitting
when
he
violates
the
no
strike
clause
and
he
ought
to
assuming
that's
what
he
wanted.
and
he
concurred
with
that.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
was
in
the
case
bill
dealing
with
section
10(d)
and
10(d)
did
not
survive
the
taft-hartley.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
i
do,
and
that's
where
the
dialogue
took
place.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
a
remedy
suggested--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--that
is
my
opinion
of
the
congressional
history
about
this.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
i
have
a
minute,
and
i
want
to
address,
very
quickly,
two
issues.
note
that
on
page
25
of
the
joint
appendix
the
respondents
admitted
in
the
answer
that
the
local
union
did
not
authorize
or
condone
the
strike.
so
that's
not
at
issue.
respondents
admitted
in
their
answer
that
the
local
union
did
not
authorize
the
strike.
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
it
certainly
is,
it
admitted
that
they
did
not
condone
it.
and
we
have
no
foundation
of
asserting
they
hadn't,
based
on
our
understanding
of
the
facts.
the
injunction
did
go
against
the
employees.
the
local
union
was
only
party
to
one
of
the
three
consolidated
lawsuits
so
the
injunction
was
intended
to
go
against
the
employees
in
that
the--
mr.
r.
ian
hunter
--that's
right.
and
it
was
found
by
the
court,
right.
and
the
jurisdiction
of
a
matter
of
this
nature
was
alluded
to
in
this
court's
decision
in
smith
v.
evening
news,
alluding
to
atkinson
v.
sinclair
as
a
jurisdictional
admission.
thank
you.
