mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
respectfully
urge
this
honorable
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
6th
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
conclude
that
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
a
damage
remedy
under
section
301
against
its
employees
who
breached
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
participating
in
an
unauthorized
work
stoppage;
and
that
the
petitioners'
remedies
and
relief
under
section
301
are
discipline
and
discharge
of
employees,
which
i
may
add,
it
has
already
done;
it
obtained
a
boys
market
injunction;
and
it
quickly
did
end
the
unauthorized
work
stoppage
which
it
has
already
obtained;
and
they
had
the
cooperation
and
the
assistance
of
the
union
in
not
authorizing
or
sanctioning
the
work
stoppage,
and
also
urging
the
employees
to
return
to
work.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
are
we
somehow
saying
that
ingrid
bergman
is
also
covered
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement?
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
she's
a
member
of
the
screen
actors'
guild.
i
would
say
then,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
provisions
of
the
act,
although
not
expressing
it,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
policy
behind
the
act
would
not
allow
a
damage
remedy.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
well,
i
think
the
purposes
of
the
enactment
of
section
301
are...
when
i
say
limited,
are...
it
was
to
make
unions
responsible,
allow
a
forum
in
which
they
could
be
sued
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
agreements,
it
was
to
also
assure
the
union...
let
me
back
up.
it
was
also
to
assure
employees
that
even
if
they
did
violate
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
would
not
be
subject
to
a
damage
action
but--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--okay.
well--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--the
language
does
not
expressly
state
that,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
saying
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
it
was
to
accomplish
certain
limited
ends.
when
i
say,
limited,
it
wanted
to
make
unions
responsible
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
no,
it
didn't
want
to
make
employees
irresponsible.
and
the
nature
of
an
employer's
relief,
i
maintain,
is
that
employees
who
do
violate
the
terms
of
a
contract
are
subject
to
discipline
and/or
discharge.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
under
section
301,
i
am
maintaining,
they
would
not
be,
because
congress
in
enacting
the
legislation
created
these
rights
that
can
be
used
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
contract
to
a
specific
group.
and
i
say,
it
bound
the
union,
it
made
the
union
responsible
for
its
actions.
it
makes...
when
i
say
it
makes
the
employees
responsible,
it
makes
it
that
if
the
employee
breaches
the
terms
of
a
contract
and
the
employer
acts
by
disciplining
or
discharging
the
employee,
the
employee
has,
what
i
say,
no
recourse.
the
enactment,
at
the
time
section
301
was
enacted,
the
taft-hartley
act
added
union
unfair
labor
practices,
it
also
stated
that
if
an
employer
discharges
an
employee
and
the
employer
has
cause,
the
employee
does
not
have
a
right
of
action
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
allege
that
his
discharge
was
violative
of
that.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
i'm
unaware
of
any
actions
that
have
happened.
that
isn't
to
say
that
there
isn't
any;
i'm
just
saying
that
i
am
unaware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
well,
if
there
would,
it
wouldn't
be
under
301.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
there
conceivably
could
be,
if
their
rights
were
violated.
but
the
focus
that
we
have
to
put
in
front
of
us
now
is
that
this
action
was
brought
under
section
301,
it
wasn't
brought
under
diversity,
it
wasn't
brought
under
any--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--okay,
i
can't
see
any
reason
why
they
could
not.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
okay.
i'm
not
going
to
contend...
that
i'm
unaware
whether
congress
intended
to
wipe
out--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--but
that
is...
okay,
that
is
a
matter
that,
how
this
matter
originally
arose,
and
it
arose
in
1976.
yes,
it
was--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--it
is
that
whether
it's
under
section
301--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--over
a
damage
action
against
individual
employees.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
it's
a
suit
that
is
maintainable
under
301--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--in
construing
section
301(a),
the
type
of
suit,
to
seek
the
remedy
of
damage,
i
would
say
that
section
301(a)
does
not
intend
that
type
of--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--no,
it
would
not
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
district
court
to
entertain
a
suit
of
this
type.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
true.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
that's
right.
if
section
301
does
not
authorize
the
suit,
then--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--that's
the
end--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--well,
the
employer
has
the
option
of
disciplining
or
discharging
the
employees.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
if
the
employer
so--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
no,
he
can
do
what
this
employer
did,
is
go
into
federal
district
court
and
seek
an
injunction
which
it
obtained.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
because
in
this
particular
action
the
employer
in
his
filing
of
the
lawsuit
filed
it
against
both
the
union
and
the
employees
and
we
did
not
raise
the
particular
question
at
the
time.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
okay,
i--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--no,
i'm
not
conceding
the
cause
of
action,
your
honor.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
with
boys
market
this
court
concluded
that
if
the
matter
is
subject
to
the
parties'
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
the
walkout
involves
a
dispute
that
is
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
then
an
injunction
can
be
obtained.
and
that's
what
the
district
court
on
the
second
hearing
concluded,
that
the
employer
was
entitled
to
a
boys
market
injunction.
now--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--yes.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
it
ran
against
the
employees,
it
ran
against
the
local,
it
ran
against
the
international.
and
as
soon
as
the
injunction
was
issued
they
went
back
to
work.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
see,
the
301
action
would
refer
to
the
ability
under
301
to
obtain
a
damage...
the
remedy
of
damages
against
employees
participating
in
an
unauthorized
work
stoppage,
it
seems
to
me.
and
i
say
that
under
section
301,
which
created
certain
type
of
rights
which
permitted
certain
types
of
actions
against
a
union,
that
to
presume
because
the
language
does
not
specifically
say
that
the
employer,
you
cannot
sue
individual
employees
individually
for
their
participation
in
an
unauthorized
work
stoppage,
thereby
you
can
read
that
into
it
because
it
doesn't
explicitly
say
you
can't.
i'm
saying,
in
a
statute
of
this
type
where
there
are
rights
that
are
created,
you
should...
if
it
was
congress'
intent
to
have
a
remedy
such
as
a
damage
remedy
against
individual
employees
who
participate
in
unauthorized
work
stoppages,
it
should
have
been
explicitly
stated
and
expressly
stated.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
okay,
i
would
say
that
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
permit
it,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
say
that
congress
intended
to
allow
it,
and
what
petitioners
are
attempting
to
have
this
court
do
is
by
the
inventive...
because
this
is
an
area
that's
in
the
penumbra,
is
to
use
the
judicial
inventiveness
to
allow
them
to
sue
and
obtain
a
money
damage
action,
remedy,
against
employees
where
the
language
doesn't
say
they
can.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
yes,
i
would
say,
even
if
there
were
diversity,
if
it
was
under
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
that
there
would
be
a
prohibition.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
smith
v.
evening
news?
okay,
it
was
basically
a
question
of
double
jurisdiction.
and
you
can...
this
court
could
have
arrived
at
the
decision
at
smith
v.
evening
news
without
determining,
for
example,
whether
the
employees,
the
employee
who
was
suing
for
a
wage
claim,
basically,
was
"a
party"
to
the
contract,
i
said,
a
party
to
the
contract.
is
it
one
of
the...
when
you
talk
in
terms
of
301(a),
we
talk
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
of
the
parties.
now,
does
that
just
mean
the
employer
and
the
labor
organization
who
are
"the
parties"
who,
to
the
contract?
would
it
permit
in
an
individual
who
is
a
beneficiary
of
that
contract
to
sue
for
rights
under
the
contract?
suing
for
rights
under
the
contract,
this
court,
i
would
say,
allowed
in
suits
such
as
smith,
allowed
in
suits
such
as--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
no,
it
would
be
inconsistent,
it
would
not...
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
decisions
that--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
yes,
i
would
say
if
you're
going
to
be
going
under,
if
the
theory
of
the
lawsuit
involves
collective
bargaining
and
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
well,
i
don't
know...
okay,
if
she's
covered
under
this
contract.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
right,
my
answer
would
be
the
same
again.
now...
and,
what
i
see,
employer
petitioner
really
has
obtained
all
the
relief
that
it
can
under
the
statute.
as
i
mentioned,
they
did
obtain
a
boys
market
injunction,
they
did
discipline
and
discharge
employees,
and
they
obtained
the
union's
cooperation
by
not
authorizing
the
work
stoppage.
the...
okay,
in
enacting
the
section
301,
the
congress
indicated
what
it
wanted
to
do
is,
it
tended
to
make
unions
accountable.
they
wanted
to
insure
enforcement
of
the
contracts;
i
think
did
not
want
to
impose
a
damage
action
remedy
against
individual
employees
who
participated
in
unauthorized
work
stoppages;
and
again,
it
allows
the
employer
the
ability
to
discharge
employees
who
were
involved
in
an
unauthorized
work
stoppage
by
disciplining
them
and/or
discharging
them.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
if
the
single
worker
was
covered
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
i
don't...
okay,
what
i'm...
i
guess,
if
you
could
imagine
a
situation
where
there
were
100
employees
and
only
one
walked
out,
yet
caused
the
employer
damages,
and
what
i
would
maintain
is,
that
employee
could
only
be
discharged.
the
fact
that
he
caused
his
employer
monetary
damages,
the
employer
could
not
bring
a
301
action
against
the
employee
for
the
damages
imposed.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
it
was
brought
under
301(a),
yes.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
okay,
it
involves--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--right.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
that
is
true.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
well,
i
think
that
it
can
be
brought
against...
okay,
it
has
been
brought
against
both.
had
i
looked...
looking
backward,
i
may
have
in
1976
raised
certain
question
at
the
point
of
time
that
initially
the
employer
decided
it
wasn't
going
to
pursue
it
any
further
against
the
union.
but
both
parties
were
initially
brought
under
the
lawsuit.
the
lawsuit
was
filed
against
individuals
as
well
as
the
local,
and
the
international,
and
there
was
a
work
cessation
and
the
court
enjoined
it
and
enjoined
everybody
at
the
time,
including
the
employees.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
the
petitioners
elected
not
to
pursue
the
cause
of
action
against
them.
once
the--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--once
the
work
stoppage
ended,
everybody
went
back
to
work
and
the
petitioners
pursued
the
damage
remedy
against
the
employees.
and
may
i
add,
the
decision
that
the
petitioners
made
was
much,
in
point
of
time,
earlier
than
this
court's
decision
in
carbon
fuel.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
no,
it
was,
the
only
decision
that
the
court
made
was
to
order
everybody
back
to
work.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
no,
that's
correct.
and
this
lawsuit,
i
guess,
could
have
continued
with
the
petitioner
suing
both
the
local
and
international--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--well--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--okay.
had
they
elected
to
continue
with
the
lawsuit,
i
would
have...
no,
it
would
have
had--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--no,
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
had
petitioner
elected
to
continue
keeping
all
the
parties
in
the
lawsuit--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--what
would
have
happened
is,
i
guess
the
same
type
of
motions
could
have
been
brought,
saying
that
you
could
not,
by
respondents,
that
you
could
not
have,
permit
a
damage
action
against
individual
employees.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
well,
yes,
under--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--well,
you
could
have
precipitated
the
matter
by
saying
that
301
would
not
permit
a
damage
remedy
against
individual
employees;
as
i
did.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
right.
then
you
would
have
been
faced
with
the
same
matter--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--we
don't
know.
your
honor,
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
there
was
a
congressional
concern
to
avoid
the
repetition
of
danbury
hatters,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
atkinson
case,
that
what
the
way
the
lawsuit
developed
was
that
it
was
only
the
individual
employees
who
were
sued,
and
it
was
only
the
individual
employees
who
had
a
judgment
against
them.
and
the
$250,000
that
the
danbury
hatters
employees
were
sued
pales
in
significance
to
the
amount
of
dollars
that
are
being
sought
in
this
particular
case.
now,
that
really
has
no
bearing,
but,
see,
congress
was
concerned
that
under
danbury
that
they
didn't
want
to
have
a
repetition
of
danbury
hatters,
and
my
contention
is,
with
respect
to
that,
is
that
not
only
in
the
situation
where
you
could
say
conceivably
it
was
the
union
that
was
at
fault.
i
think
congress
spoke
and
said,
we
do
not
want
to
have
a
situation
where
individual
employees
would
be
responsible
in
damages
for
even
unauthorized
work
stoppages,
their
breaches
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
okay.
i
relied
on
the
fact
that
had
congress
intended
to
include
and
allow
damage
actions
such
as
petitioner
is
seeking,
it
would
have
said
so.
okay?
now,
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
that
it
was,
what
i
say,
creating
these
rights
in
this
legislation.
so
if
it
intended
to
do
it,
it
would
have
said
it.
and
you
should
not
by
implication
say
it
is
there
because
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
one
way
or
the
other.
the
reason
that
i
feel
that
in
301(b)
there's
the
language
that
says
that
if
a
union
is
responsible
for
a
breach
you
should
not
look
to
the
employees,
is
that
that
was
the
only
type
of
remedy,
monetary
remedy
that
congress
was
willing
to
allow.
they
were
willing
to
allow
a
damage
action
against
unions
if
they
had
breached
the
terms
of
the
contract.
and
if
they,
the
union,
breached
the
terms
of
the
contract,
you
can
get
a
money
damage
remedy
against
them.
but
not
against
the
employees.
and
that
is
the
only
type
of
money
damage
remedy
that
in
effect
was
flowing
from
301
that
was
hitting,
directed
at
the
union,
and
if
it's
directed
at
the
union,
you
can't
direct
it
at,
you
can't
collect
from
the
employees.
and
there
was
no
intention
to
permit
a
damage
remedy
against
the
individual
employees.
okay,
now--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--from
financial
liability.
they
are
not
immune,
no,
but--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--right;
financial
liability,
and
as
i
said,
the
reason
that
that
was
the
case
is
that
congress
recognized,
and
acknowledged,
that
employees
who
do
participate
in
unauthorized
activity,
who
breach
the
contract,
are
subject
to
discharge
and
discipline,
and
they
have
no
protection
under
the
act.
and
that
was
the
type
of
relief
that
was
afforded
them.
i
don't
think
that
any
arguments
of
mutuality
because
the
employee
can
sue
the
employer
for
money
damages
thereby
entitles
the
employer
to
sue
the
employee
for
money
damages.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
no,
but
we
have
an
overwhelming--
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
--we
have
an
overwhelming
policy
to
promote,
to
promote
the
adherence
to
the
terms
of
the
contract.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
that
is
correct.
under
boys
market.
we
read
it,
in
those
limited
situations
that
the
court
outlined
in
boys
market.
this
court,
in
boys
market,
also
acknowledged
that
even...
and
one
of
the
reasons
maybe
that
it
was
granted,
that
injunctive
relief
was
granted
in
boys
market,
was
this
court's
acknowledgment
that
even
to
permit
a
damage
action
which
happens
when
an
employer
sues
a
union
is
not
conducive
to
promoting
industrial
stability,
and
that
was
a
main
purpose
of
the
act,
to
promote
industrial
stability.
now,
you
will
not
promote...
i
maintain
you
will
not
promote
industrial
stability
by
allowing
the
damage
remedy
action.
this
petitioner
has
discharged
employees,
it's
almost
five
years
after
the
incident
in
question,
it's
still
pursuing
the
remedy
of
damages,
and
it
does
nothing
but
exacerbate
the
industrial
peace.
mr.
hiram
s.
grossman
it
does.
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
it
doesn't,
but
within
two
weeks...
and
that's
a
long
time...
the
entire
matter
was
settled
in
terms
of
the,
from
the
time
that
the
action
began
to
the
time
that
they
were
ordered
back
to
work,
two
weeks
elapsed.
and
thereafter
the
discharges
occurred
which
would
have
ended
it
but
for
this.
thank
you
very
much.
