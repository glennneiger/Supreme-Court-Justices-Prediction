justice
stewart
is
this
exclusively
a
question
under
section
301?
justice
stewart
of
the
1947
act?
justice
stewart
well,
the
question
would
be,
whether
a
federal
law
affirmatively
says
there
is
no
cause
of
action
against
individual
employees--
justice
stewart
--or
whether
the
holding
is
that
federal
law
just
is
nonexistent
in
that
area.
justice
stewart
no,
and
the
first
one
there,
it
clearly
would
not
be.
justice
stewart
but
if
federal
law
affirmatively
says
there
cannot
be
a
right
of
action
against
individual
employees,
then
there
can't
be
in
the
a
state
court
either.
justice
stewart
you
don't
have
to
assume
it.
that's
been
held.
justice
stewart
well,
except
that,
as
suggested
earlier,
just
because
you
don't
have
a
lawsuit
under
section
301
in
a
federal
district
court
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
don't
have
an
action
for
a
breach
of
contract
in
a
state
court.
justice
stewart
if
the
result
of
this
case
is
there
just
isn't
any
federal
law,
that
this
isn't
under
301,
but
it's
not
prohibited
by
federal
law,
then
you
do
have,
presumably,
subject
to
the
state
law--
justice
stewart
--then
it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law,
whether
or
not
you
have
one.
justice
stewart
might
be
very
undesirable.
justice
stewart
well,
the
question
here
is,
isn't
it...
or
am
i
mistaken?
whether
or
not
section
301
confers
federal
jurisdiction
over
a
case
such
as
this?
justice
stewart
well,
is
that
the
question
or
not?
justice
stewart
whether
or
not
section
301
confers
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
district
court
over
an
action
such
as
this?
justice
stewart
how...
why
can
he
do
that
under
301?
why
do
you
concede
that?
justice
stewart
it
would
seem
to
me
if
he
can,
and
if
you
concede
that
he
can,
then
you're
conceding
away
your
lawsuit.
justice
stewart
do
you
concede
or
do
you
not
that
this
lawsuit
comes
within
the
literal
language
of
301(a)?
justice
stewart
well,
do
you...
perhaps
you
didn't
understand
my
question.
does
the
lawsuit
come
within
the
literal
language
of
301(a)?
justice
stewart
this
was
a
contract
between
an
employer
and
the
laborers'
organization--
justice
stewart
--representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
and
this
is
a
suit
for
violation
of
that
contract.
justice
stewart
and
therefore,
do
you
concede
that
it
comes
within
the
literal
language
of
301(a)?
or
do
you
think
that
a
suit
for
violation
of
that
contract
can
as
a
matter
of
law
be
brought
only
against
the
labor
organizations?
