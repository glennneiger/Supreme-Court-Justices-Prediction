chief

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
now
in
complete
auto
transit
v.
reis.
mr.
hunter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
you're
equating
that
to
ordinary
breach
of
contract
between
private
parties?
chief
justice
burger
just
as
though
there
was
no
union
entity
involved?
chief
justice
burger
just
as
though
124
individuals
had
signed
a
contract
with
the
employer
without
any
union?
chief
justice
burger
yes.
that's
what
i'm
driving
at.
chief
justice
burger
well,
the
legislative
history
reflects
that
discharge
was
a
remedy--
chief
justice
burger
--but
it
could
not
negate
a
private
suit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
grossman.
chief
justice
burger
you
might
at
some
point,
if
you
would,
touch
on
that
legislative
history,
but
at
your
own
time
and
convenience.
chief
justice
burger
justice
rehnquist's
question
takes
me
back
to
the
one
i
put
to
your
friend
at
the
outset:
are
you
saying
that
you
have
the
same
kind
of
claim
as
though
you
have
individual
contracts
with
these
employees
with
no
union
involved
at
all?
and
i
think
he
said,
yes.
now,
to
take
the
ingrid
bergman
or
any
other
star,
if
ingrid
bergman,
for
example,
made
a
private
contract,
is
not
a
member
of
any
union,
then
walked
off
the
scene
when
they'd
done
half
of
the
film
and
spent
millions
of
dollars,
would
there
not
be
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
for
damages
against
her?
chief
justice
burger
no,
no,
but,
there's
no
question
about
if
there
would
be,
would
there
not?
a
breach
of
contract?
chief
justice
burger
then
the
question
arises,
whether
301
precludes...
now,
you,
you,
i
take
it,
concede
that
there
being
no
union
contract,
there
being
no
301
problem,
the
producer
could
have
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
against
the
actor
or
actress.
chief
justice
burger
there's
no
equitable
remedy
available
because
they
can't
compel
the
painting
of
a
picture
or
the
performance
of
a
work
of
art.
so,
what
is
the
difference,
then,
because
there
happens
to
be
a
collective
bargaining
contract?
unless
you
can
point
to
something
that
congress
intended
to
wipe
out
that
private
action.
chief
justice
burger
what
section
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
what
language?
chief
justice
burger
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
congress
said,
yes,
you
can
collect
from
the
union,
if
the
union
breaches
the
contract,
that
is,
if
the
walkout
is
with
the
union's
approval.
but
the
individual
members
are
immune
from
liability?
chief
justice
burger
from
financial--
chief
justice
burger
--is
there
any
express
language
in
the
acts
authorizing
an
injunction?
chief
justice
burger
that's
been
read
into
the
statute,
now,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
that's
been
read
into
the
statute,
notwithstanding
the
norris-la
guardia
act?
chief
justice
burger
well,
of
course,
then
a
wildcat
strike
also
exacerbates
industrial
peace,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
have
you
anything
further,
mr.
hunter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
