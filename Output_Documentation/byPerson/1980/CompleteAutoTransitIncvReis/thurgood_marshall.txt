a
big
one?
justice
marshall
let
me
ask
you,
if
90
percent
of
the
employees
go
out
on
an
illegal
strike,
is
firing
them
an
adequate
remedy?
justice
marshall
because
he
couldn't
run
on
ten,
with
that,
can
he?
justice
marshall
i
said,
if
90
percent
are
out,
is
his
only
remedy
to
fire
90
percent
of
his
labor
force?
