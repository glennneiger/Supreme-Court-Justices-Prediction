ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
the
uniform
extradition
act
and
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
both
interstate
compacts
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states.
the
issue
before
the
court
involves
the
interrelationship
of
these
two
important
compacts
as
they
affect
the
interstate
transfer
of
a
prisoner
who
has
a
detainer
lodged
against
him
and
who
is
sought
for
trial
on
criminal
charges
in
another
state.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
the
detainer
agreement,
your
honor?
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
compact,
rather
an
agreement
entered
into
by
party
states.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
i
have
not
focused
on
that
issue
and
i
apologize.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
the
3rd
circuit
relying
on
this
court's
decisions
found
that
there
was
a
question
of
federal
law
and
that
it
is
a--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--and
it
is
a
compact.
they
found
it
to
be
a
compact.
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
passed
on
this
specific
issue
as
far
as
the
agreement
is
concerned.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
it
might
be
a
question
of
state
law.
however,
a
federal
interpretation
would
govern
because
it
is
a
compact.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
i
would
agree
that
simply
because
the
united
states
has
adopted
the
agreement
doesn't
automatically
make
it
a
federal
law.
however,
if
the
agreement
is
one
which
has
been
sanctioned
by
congress...
and
here
i
believe
the
sanction
by
congress
was
given
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
agreement...
then
i
believe
that
federal
interpretation
would
be
binding
on
the
states.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
i
do
not
differ
with
that
position,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
factual
and
procedural
posture
of
the
case
is
briefly
summarized.
respondent
is
a
inmate
confined
in
a
pennsylvania
prison
who
was
wanted
for
trial
on
criminal
charges
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
he
was
being
sought
pursuant
to
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
and
he
alleges
that
this
transfer
under
the
agreement
rather
than
under
the
uniform
extradition
act
violated
his
constitutionally
protected
rights
in
two
ways.
one,
the
failure
to
advise
him
of
his
right
to
petition
the
governor
of
the
sending
state
to
review
the
custody
request,
and
secondly,
the
absence
of
a
pretransfer
hearing
violated
his
right
to
due
process.
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
the
state
did
not
provide
him
with
a
pretransfer
hearing
as
in
the
case
of
a
transfer
under
the
extradition
act
deprived
him
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
3rd
circuit
and
that
court
held
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
never
reaching
the
federal
issues,
that
article
iv(d)
of
the
agreement
preserves
a
prisoner's
existing
procedural
rights
under
the
extradition
act,
section
10
more
specifically.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
that's
right,
your
honor.
your
honor,
in
reaching
their
decision
the
appellate
court
relied
on
the
language
of
article
iv(d)
which
states
that
the
agreement
does
not
deprive
a
prisoner
of
any
right
which
he
may
have
to
contest
the
legality
of
his
delivery,
as
provided
in
paragraph
(a)
hereof.
however,
nothing
in
the
agreement
suggests
that
any
right
includes
extradition
act
procedures,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
language
which
i
have
just
quoted
refers
only
to
the
right
to
petition
the
governor
to
disapprove
the
request
of
the
prosecutor
for
temporary
custody.
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
commentary
by
the
council
of
state
governments
to
article
iv(d).
and
here
again
they
relied
on
language
concerning
extradition.
but
here
extradition
was
not
defined
in
terms
of
the
extradition
act.
therefore
they
relied
on
a
commentary
which
was
in
itself
ambiguous
and
unenlightening.
they
also
pointed
to
language
in
article
iii(e)
to
the
effect
that
a
prisoner
who
himself
requests
final
disposition
on
outstanding
charges
waives
extradition.
again,
article
iii
does
not
define
extradition,
and
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
framers
of
the
agreement
to
define
extradition
here
since
extradition
was
being
waived.
so
reference
to
article
iii(e)
language
is
also
unenlightening.
your
honor,
this
court
has
defined
extradition
in
its
cases,
and
the
extradition
clause
of
the
u.
s.
constitution
and
its
implementing
legislation
do
not
define
extradition
in
terms
of
a
pretransfer
hearing.
so
it
would
seem
to
us
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
every
time
the
word
extradition
is
used
a
pretransfer
hearing
is
implied.
neither
the
extradition
clause
nor
the
federal
implementing
legislation
nor
the
definition
of
this
court
of
the
term
"extradition"
would
imply
a
pretransfer
hearing.
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
article
iv(d)
is
not
only
against
the
clear
and
literal
reading
of
the
statute
itself
but
it
goes
against
the
purpose
of
the
agreement.
and
article
i,
the
last
sentence
of
article
i,
states
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
to
provide
cooperative
procedures.
the
article
had
been
talking
of
the
need
to
have
cooperative
procedures
when
there
is
an
interstate
transfer
of
prisoners
and
the
framers
clearly
said,
"it
is
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
to
provide
such
cooperative
procedures.
"
this
language
indicates
that
the
framers
intended
to
provide
specific
mechanism
for
these
transfers;
it
was
an
affirmative
statement
that
they
were
to
provide
certain
procedures
to
accomplish
what
was
to
be
the
expeditious
and
orderly
disposition
of
outstanding
charges.
if
the
framers
had
not
intended
to
set
out
a
complete
self-contained
system,
a
complete
procedure
within
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement,
i
think
that
they
would
have
so
specified.
they
would
have
set
out
a
particular
procedure
and
they
would
not
have
stated
in
article
i
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
to
provide
the
procedures.
so
i
believe
that
the
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
goes
against
the
clear
intent
set
out
in
article
i
of
the
agreement.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
the
statute
itself
does
not
provide
that
he
be
advised.
however,
the
forms
which
have
been
adopted
by
all
of
the
states
for
the
promulgation
of
the
procedures
within
the
agreement
advises
the
prisoner
when
a
detainer
is
lodged
against
him
that
he
has
several
options.
a
detainer
has
been
lodged
against
him
and
he
may
under
article
iii
proceed
to
seek
final
resolution
of
the
detainer,
or
under
article
iv...
and
they
give
the
procedures
to
be
followed.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
show
either
way.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
he
alleges,
he
discussed
only
the
time
frame
from
when
the
custody
request
was
received
by
the
state.
there
is
no
discussion
as
to
the
detainer,
when
the
detainer
was
first
filed.
and
i
would
submit,
therefore,
that
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
whether
he
received
notice
of
the
filing
of
the
detainer
or
form
1.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
way
the
record
stands
at
this
point
it's
incomplete
on
that
issue.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
normally
i
would
agree
with
you
but
in
this
particular
case
i
think
that
there
is
a
lack
of
information
on
that
point.
he
speaks
only
of
when
the
custody
request
was
lodged.
he
does
not
speak
of
any
prior
period
of
time.
he
does
not
say
specifically
that
he
did
not
receive
notice
of
a
detainer.
the
complaint
doesn't
say
that.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
as
i
was
stating,
when
the
prisoner
receives
notice
of
the
detainer,
he
receives
it
through
a
form,
form
1.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
no,
your
honor.
your
honor,
to
continue
on
the
issue
of
the
interpretation
of
the
article
iv(d)
by
the
3rd
circuit,
it
appears
that
the
3rd
circuit
interpretation
would
have
us
assume
that
every
state
which
adopts
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
has
a
uniform
extradition
act.
and
this
is
just
not
so.
there
are
still
states
which
do
not
have
that
act.
therefore,
it
would
be
incongruous
for
a
court
to
conclude
that
a
prisoner
has
rights
derivative
from
a
statute
which
may
not
exist
in
a
particular
state.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
may
be
construed
as
to
mean
that
whatever
statute
on
extradition
exists
in
that
state
should
be
applied.
well,
your
honors,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
an
equally
irrational
result,
because
the
uniform
agreement
on
detainers
is
supposed
to
be
a
uniform
statute
with
uniform
procedures
throughout
the
country.
this
is
the
intent
of
the
framers,
this
is
what
is
going
to
facilitate
transfers.
and
to
have
the
result
that
the
procedures
are
going
to
differ
depending
on
the
particular
extradition
statute
in
each
state
is
simply
absurd.
it
defeats
both
the
character
of
the
statute
in
its
uniformity,
and
it
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
itself.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
uniformity
of
the
procedure
here
is
strongly
supported
by
the
purpose
enunciated
in
article
i
of
the
agreement,
which
is
to
provide
the
procedures
to
be
followed.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
this
agreement,
the
enunciation
by
the
framers,
specifically
states
in
article
i
that
cooperative
procedures
are
going
to
be
provided.
i
think
that
that
implies
that
they're
going
to
be
the
same
procedures.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor,
we
have--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
we
believe
also
that
the
reliance
placed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
legislative
history
is
misplaced
here.
however,
we
agree
that
legislative
history
may
be
consulted
by
the
court
when
the
language
of
the
statute
is
unclear
and
when
the
legislative
history
would
clarify
the
question.
here
that
is
just
simply
not
so.
in
fact,
the
interpretation
given
to
iv(d)
defeats
the
very
purpose
of
the
agreement,
which
is
the
expeditious
and
orderly
disposition
of
detainers.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
think
it
means
that
the
prisoner
has
those
rights
enumerated
in
paragraph
(a).
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
i
think,
your
honor,
that
was...
that
is
a
clarifying
reference
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
unusual
in
statutes
to
find--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--well,
your
honor,
he
has
the
right
to
petition
the
governor.
he
has
the
30-day--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--that's
right,
if
the
prisoner
petitions.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
both
that
and
to
give
him
an
opportunity
during
the
30-day
period
to
take
whatever
other
action
he
might
deem
appropriate.
for
example,
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
no,
it
is
not.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
that's
right.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
believe
the
right
to
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
a
right
which
cannot
be
abrogated
by
particular
statute.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
that's
right.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
it
preserves
a
right
which
is
a
fundamental
right,
a
right
which
is
not
a
matter
of
state
law
such
as
uniform
extradition
procedures
would
be.
but
it
would
be
a
right
which
belongs
to
the
prisoner
because
of
constitutional
provisions.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
within
the
framework
of
this
statute,
the
only
right
which
this
particular
statutory
provision
gives
him
is
a
right
to
petition
the
governor,
we
believe.
however,
this
statute,
taken
as
a
whole,
does
not
obligate
the
prisoner's
rights
that
he
may
have
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
for
any
other--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
at
that
point
we
are
getting
into
reliance
on
another
statute
and
then
we
have
to
look
at
the
interrelationship
between
the
extradition
act
and
the
detainer
agreement.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
extradition
act
is
a
general
statute
which
addresses
the
subject
of
extradition
of
any
persons,
and
it
focuses
on
the
extradition
of
prisoners
in
a
particular
section
but
that
focuses
on
both
sentenced
and
unsentenced
prisoners,
whereas
the
detainer
agreement
specifically--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
however,
the
protections
that
he
had
were
possibly
subject
to
modification
by
the
executive
authority
under
section
5,
your
honor.
the
executive
authority
of
the
state
was
free
to
enter
into
agreements
for
the
transfer
of
prisoners,
and
i
think
there
there's
a
possibility
that
under
section
5...
i
suggested
that
in
my
brief...
the
executive
authority
might
enter
into
an
agreement
which
would
differ
from
the
extradition
act
procedures
themselves
when
dealing
with
a
prisoner.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor,
it
may.
however,
when
you
have
the
general
statute
such
as
the
extradition
act
and
then
the
enactment
of
a
specific
statute
such
as
the
detainer
agreement
which
focuses
specifically
on
sentenced
prisoners
who
have
a
detainer
lodged
against
them,
then
i
think
the
terms
of
the
specific
statute
must
control.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
no,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
correct,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
detainer
agreement
is
a
specific
statute
which
deals--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--and
once,
i
think,
you
have
the
enactment
of
a
specific
statute
which
deals
with
the
procedures
to
be
had
when
a
prisoner
is
transferred,
those
are
the
procedures
which
control.
and
i
believe
that
the
language
30-day
waiting
period
and
the
opportunity
that
the
prisoner
has
to
petition
the
governor.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
interrelationship
of
the
two
acts...
and
i
apologize
for
repeating
myself,
but
i
do
think
that
that,
in
my
mind,
that
is
the
issue,
the
interrelationship
of
these
two
acts,
the
purpose
of
the
extradition
act,
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
on
detainers.
there's
a
general
statute
which
gives
particular
rights
to
a
class,
and
then
there's
a
more
specific
statute
which
refines
the
class
and
mandates
a
certain
procedure
for
that
class.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
well,
your
honor,
the
commentary
does
not
say,
under
the
extradition
statute.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
right,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
the
extradition
process
clearly
includes
a
pretransfer
hearing.
the
extradition
clause
in
the
federal
implementing
legislation
certainly
doesn't
require
a
pretransfer
hearing.
and
there
may
be
valid
state
laws
which
would
not
require
a
pretransfer
hearing.
so
i
don't
think
that
it's
logical
to
assume
that
extradition
process
means
a
hearing.
that
is
our
position.
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
consequences
of
the
decision
of
the
3rd
circuit
have
some
very,
what
we
believe
to
be
some
unreasonable
effects
and
consequences.
first
of
all,
the
decision
provides
greater
procedural
protections
to
a
prisoner
who
is
wanted
for
trial
in
another
state
than
to
the
man
on
the
street
who
is
arrested
on
a
governor's
warrant
and
is
transferred
to
another
state.
because
now
you
have
in
effect
the
procedures
of
both
the
detainer
agreement
and
the
extradition
act
which
accrue
to
a
prisoner,
whereas
the
man
in
the
street
is
simply
protected
by
the
extradition
act.
i
would
submit
that
if
there's
a
class
of
people,
of
the
two,
that
needs
greater
protection
because
of
the
basic
interest
involved,
i
would
say
that
the
man
on
the
street
has
a
great
deal
more
to
lose
by
what
could
be
a
permanent
transfer
to
another
jurisdiction
than
a
prisoner
who
is
being
transferred
for
a
120-day
period.
the
prisoner's
transfer
under
the
detainer
act
is
temporary.
the
prisoner
receives
substantial
benefits
under
that
act.
he
may...
any
charges
outstanding
in
a
receiving
jurisdiction
which
are
not
acted
upon
in
the
120-day
period
will
be
dismissed.
this
is
a
great
bonus
to
an
inmate.
also,
while
he's
serving
the
time
in
the
demanding
jurisdiction,
his
sentence
which
he
was
serving
in
the
asylum
state
continues
to
be
served.
he
is
not
losing
anything.
there
might
be
interruption
in
his
programs,
perhaps
he
loses
his
job,
he's
away
from
his
family,
but
these
are
minor
considerations
when
compared
to
the
loss
suffered,
the
liberty
loss
suffered
by
the
man
on
the
street
when
he's
arrested
and
transferred.
so
it
is
an
absurd
result
which
the
3rd
circuit
decision
requires,
and
respondent
has
argued
in
his
brief
that
because
of
the
evils
of
the
detainers
lodged
against
an
inmate
the
prisoner
requires
greater
procedural
protections.
well,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
on
its
face
a
meritless
conclusion.
and
secondly,
here
it's
not
the
detainer
which
is
being
attacked
but
the
transfer
itself.
furthermore,
there's
the
matter
of
the
30-day
waiting
period.
this
defeats
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
agreement
and
that
is
to
expeditiously
try
the
underlying
specific
detainer.
this
30-day
period
must
elapse
before
any
procedure
in
court
is
begun,
because
during
that
30-day
period
the
governor
of
the
state
may
sua
sponte
disapprove
the
request.
so
therefore
we
must
wait...
now,
in
pennsylvania,
this
is
the
procedure
we're
using...
we
must
wait
for
the
30-day
period
to
elapse,
then
take
the
prisoner
before
a
court
of
record
and
at
that
point
he
can
require
a
habeas
corpus
hearing.
so
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
delay
which
has
been
built
in
to
the
agreement.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
address
that
now.
this
case
was
filed
as
a
class
action.
the
class
was
never
certified,
however.
the
prisoner
was
transferred
to
new
jersey.
he
was
tried,
convicted,
and
returned
to
pennsylvania.
therefore
i
believe
the
injunctive
relief
sought
is
mooted,
but
there's
a
damage
claim
and
i
believe
for
that
reason
the
case
is
still
a
live
case
and
properly
before
this
court.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that's...
one
dollar
under
your
decisions
is
what
he
could
recover,
but
that
still
keeps
the
case
live,
and
therefore
you
must
pass
upon
it.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
the
agreement
was
fashioned
to
achieve
several
purposes.
there
are
several
converging
interests
here.
there's
the
interest
of
the
demanding
state
in
trying
prisoners
who
have
outstanding
criminal
charges
against
them.
there's
the
interest
of
the
asylum
state
in
seeing
that
the
rehabilitation
of
the
prisoner
is
not
interrupted
by
multiple
trips
to
varying
jurisdictions.
and
finally,
there's
the
interest
of
the
prisoner
himself
in
his
rehabilitation
and
therefore
all
three
interests
must
be
taken
into
consideration.
this
statute
is
not
a
statute
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner,
as
alleged
by
respondent.
it
is
a
statute
which
considers
the
sovereign
powers
of
the
states,
both
the
demanding
and
the
asylum
state,
and
their
relationship
to
the
prisoner.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
the
agreement--
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
--detainers.
your
honor,
the
agreement
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
referring
to
the
agreement.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
holding.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
your
honor,
the
interpretation.
i
believe
that
even
though
it
is
a
matter
of
individual
state
law,
the
agreement
itself
is
a
matter
of
state
law
because
it
has
been
enacted
in
a
particular
state.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
that's
right.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
that's
right,
your
honor.
your
honor,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
thank
you.
ms.
maria
parisi
vickers
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
30-day
delay
which
mr.
crawford
seems
to
feel
is
not
a
real
delay
is
a
very
substantial
one,
because
in
the
event
that
we
do
take
a
prisoner
before
a
court
of
record
and
there
is
a
disapproval
for
the
request
for
custody
by
the
governor,
you
have
dissipation
of
court
time.
you
have...
this
is
repeated
across
the
land,
and
i
think
that's
a
very
real
consideration.
the
30-day
delay
is
a
real
one.
we
have
to
wait
until
the
31st
day
before
we
can
petition
the
courts
for
a
hearing
and
then
possibly
a
second
hearing
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
so
that
i
think
that
is
a
very
substantial
handicap
and
a
very
debilitating
consequence
of
this
interpretation.
thank
you.
