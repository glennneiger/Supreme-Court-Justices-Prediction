mr.
james
d.
crawford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
myself
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
echoed
by
mr.
justice
stewart
concerning
whether
this
is
a
federal
question
case
at
all.
it
was
very
clear
to
the
people
who
adopted
the
interstate
compact
on
detainers
that
they
were
adopting...
or
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers;
i
have
tried
to
put
my
rabbit
in
my
hat
too
far
but...
they
enacted
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
but
they
did
so
very
clearly
under
the
provisions
of
the
crime
control
consent
act
of
1934.
all
of
the
material
that
went
out
about
it
said,
this
is
the
basis
on
which
this
interstate
compact
is
permitted.
so
that,
to
the
degree
that
the
people
who
adopted
it
could
control
whether
this
was
an
interstate
compact,
they
plainly
meant
it
to
be
one.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--that
is
correct.
the
compact,
as
a
federal
law
may
do,
the
compact
recognizes
certain
rights
provided
by
state
law.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
which
may
vary
from
state
to
state,
but
an
interstate--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
because
state
law
accords
everyone
under
the
extradition
process
certain
rights.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
right.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
case
is
a
prisoner
complaint.
the
prisoner
did
not
allege
any
federal
law
violations
because
he
had
not
thought
of
the
question
which
obviously
was
later
posed,
i
think
properly,
by
the
court
of
appeals.
he
raised
serious
constitutional
questions
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
and
which
this
court
therefore
should
not
reach,
because
the
court
of
appeals
under
hagans
v.
lavine
said,
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
can
be
interpreted--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--the
federal
statute,
as
i
see
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
think
an
interstate
agreement
becomes
a
federal
compact
if
it
is
adopted
under
the
authority
of
a
congressional
resolution
permitting
an
interstate
compact.
and
in
this
case
the
fact
that
it
is
a
federal
law
question,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
fudged
a
little
on
this.
they
said,
we
don't
know
whether
every
interstate
compact
presents
a
federal
question
but
this
interstate
compact
plainly
has
been
adopted
in
haec
verba
by
the--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--the
1934
statute
was
a
general
statute--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
it
goes,
i
think,
a
little
broader
than
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
remember
it.
or
perhaps
it's
only
been
interpreted
somewhat
more
broadly.
but
that
includes
the
punishment
of
crime
or
the
other
pieces
of
the
crime
control
mechanisms,
and
plainly
this
has
to
do
with
the
ability
to
prosecute
crime
and
as
such
falls
within
the
crime
control
authorization.
i
had
hoped
to
find,
by
the
way--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
that
is
correct.
the
uniform
extradition
act
is
plainly
state
law.
it's
a
uniform
act
although
it
may
be
hopefully
interpreted
the
same
way
in
varying
states,
that's
a
state
law
question.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
mr.
justice
white,
certainly
the
states
when
they
adopted
it
believed
they
were
entering
into
an
interstate
compact.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
think
petty
vs.
tennessee-missouri
bridge
would
be
the
leading
case
on
the
point
and
it
seems
to
me
very
clear.
common
sense
tells
you
that
this
court
was
correct
in
that
case...
whatever
you
may
do
in
an
area
where
you
have
no
control.
the
uniform
act
would
be
wonderful
if
you
could
bring
uniform
acts
to
some
court
somewhere
and
get
uniform
interpretations.
there's
no
constitutional
basis
for
it.
where...
and
the
court
found
in
petty,
for
example...
that
an
interstate
compact
being
authorized
specifically
by
the
constitution
and
by
act
of
congress
presents
a
federal
question,
then
the
great
wisdom
that
permits
such
a
compact
to
be
interpreted
by
this
court,
or
initially
by
the
lower
federal
courts,
brings
a
uniformity
which
is
not
only
desirable,
as
in
the
uniform
acts,
but
also
achievable,
because
there's
a
constitutional
framework.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i'm
sorry,
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
remember
that
but--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--well,
plainly,
justice
stewart,
if
consent
of
congress
is
needed
for
these
agreements
or
compacts,
then
they're
both
compacts
for
the
purpose
of
the
compact
clause.
if
these
are
agreements
of
some
other
sort,
congressional
consent
wasn't
needed,
so
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
word
"agreement"
and
that
the
framers
of
this
compact
used
the
word
"agreement"
i
think
is
immaterial
to
the
interpretation
in
this
case.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
different
situation
when
you
say,
you
didn't
need
a
compact
in
order
to
reach
this
agreement.
it's
a
very
different
situation
from
the
case
in
which
the
states
choose
to
follow
congress
and
the
states
choose
to
follow
the
compact
clause.
i
don't
see
multistate
tax
commission
as
saying,
you
can't
make
a
compact
about
anything
but
this
very
narrow
area.
i
understand
the
case
to
say
it
is
unnecessary
to
get
congressional
approval
outside
the
narrow
area.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
they
did
in
this
case.
it
may
be
that
there's
some
limit
as
to
how
broadly
they
can
go.
but
i
think
this
is
the
sort
of
concern
which
is
at
worst
on
the
edge
of
the
area
where
compacts
are
needed
and
certainly
not
one
where,
if
the
congress
authorized
it
and
the
states
accept
that
authorization,
this
court
should
now
say,
you
thought
you
had
a
compact
and
an
agreement
under
the
compact
clause,
but
you
didn't.
i
don't
see
that
that's
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
to
back
in,
justice
stevens,
first
off,
obviously
that
agreement
would
not
be
subject
to
construction
by
you
unless
it
were
a
compact.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
believe
this
is
an
area--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--then
it
is
a
compact
and
then
it
is
subject
to
interpretation
by
this
court.
but
interpretation
would
approve
that
agreement,
because
the
whole
focus
of
this
case
and
the
whole
misguided
argument
against
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
see
it,
is
this
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
did
not
create
the
rights
about
which
we
are
talking.
it
federalized
those
rights
in
the
sense
that
when
the
interstate
agreement
was
written,
they
said,
we
choose
to
preserve
all
those
rights
which
existed;
we
don't
want
to
meddle
with
these
rights
and
we
thereby
federalize
them.
if
pennsylvania
chose
to
repeal
the
uniform
extradition
act,
which
it
has
a
perfect
right
to
do,
and
to
go
down
to
what
two
states...
there
are
still
two
left
that
have
no
uniform
act
on
this...
have
and
have
simply
the
right
to
use
governors'
warrants,
no
habeas
corpus,
no
hearings,
then
there
will
be
a
question
of
whether
there
is
some
kind
of
inherent
law
to
protect
a
person
being
extradited...
the
cases
as
i
read
them
say
there
is
very
little
if
any...
and
you
would
remove
these
rights.
but
you
remove
these
rights
by
changing
state
law.
and
i
would
point
out
last,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
never
decided
this
case.
the
superior
court
of
pennsylvania
merely
decided
that
the
interstate
compact
as
they
had
interpreted
it...
an
interpretation
was
never
argued
to
them...
wasn't
unconstitutional.
that's
all
that's
been
decided.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
hesitate
to
think
about
what
people
can
do
to
rip
jurisdictions
from
federal
courts.
i
have
watched
so
many
tough
questions
in
the
area.
i
don't
think
that
works,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i
probably
should
have
to
think
it
out
more.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
analogous
situation
in
which
for
example
the
legislatures
of
the
two
states
modified
the
extradition
act
to
remove
these
rights
only
from
people
who
are
serving
terms
in
prison
would
be
subject
to
a
substantial
constitutional
argument
on
equal
protection
grounds.
i
think
the
prisoners
would
win
it.
i
don't
know.
but
in
any
case
there'd
be
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
whether
there
isn't
a
similar
substantial
constitutional
question
when
the
governors
get
together
and
say,
we're
going
to
let
our
highest
state
courts
provide
the
"rippers"
instead
of
our
legislature.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that;
we'd
have
to
find
out
what
the
state
courts
did,
but
they
haven't
done
that
here.
at
present
we
have
the
uniform
agreement
in
exactly
the
terms
in
which
it
was
entered.
i
wonder
if
i
could
spend
a
minute
on
the
statutory
construction,
although
i
think
that
some
questions
from
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
pretty
much
construed
it
as
i
see
it.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
will
do
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
a
statute
which...
i
was
going
to
open
my
argument...
a
few
things
that
everyone
agrees
here,
and
one
is,
this
is
a
statute
for
the
protection
of
prisoners.
all
of
the
legislative
history
and
material
says
so.
the
reason
states
get
a
chance
to
move
cases
faster
is
because,
said
the
framers,
the
council
on
state
government,
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
prisoners.
they
are
better
off
if
their
cases
are
disposed
of
promptly.
i
can
no
longer
say
we
all
agree
it's
for
the
benefit
of
prisoners,
but
i
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
all
the
legislative
history...
and
this
legislative
history
is
different
from
some
places
because
this
uniform
agreement
was
circulated
with
an
attached
piece
of
history
right
with
it...
everybody
who
adopted
it
knew
what
they
were
getting.
this
is
an
act
for
the
protection
of
prisoners
and
it's
being
interpreted
by
the
state
here
to
have
taken
substantial
rights
away
from
prisoners.
and
i
suggest,
if
that's
what
the
act
was
going
to
do,
it
would
have
done
so
very
explicitly.
there
is
no
language
which
says
there
are
any
rights
which
prisoners
previously
had
under
state
law
that
are
being
taken
away
from
them.
instead,
there
is
section
iv(d)
which
says,
any
rights
you
have
are
preserved.
secondly,
the
construction
of
the
detainer
agreement
within
itself
plainly
supports
this.
you
have
the
contrast
with
article
iii,
the
prisoner-initiated
transfer,
in
which
the
prisoner
waives
extradition...
precisely
the
term,
by
the
way,
that's
used
in
the
extradition
act.
section
26
of
the
uniform
act
says,
if
you
don't
want
to
go
through
all
these
procedures,
you
waive
extradition,
you
don't
waive
extradition
act.
and
the
extradition
act
was
the
law
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
when
the
compact
or
the
agreement
was
drawn
up.
so
they're
obviously
thinking
in
precisely
those
terms.
they
say,
if
you
want
to
go
to
another
state,
you
can't
also
ask
for
a
bunch
of
rights
which
you
may
have.
whatever
you've
got,
you
give
up.
but
by
clear
contrast,
if
a
prosecutor
somewhere
else
wants
to
take
you
across
the
state
lines,
you
keep
any
rights
you
had.
the
framers
sent
out
just
a
couple
of
pages
of
legislative
history
to
go
with
it,
and
one
of
the
things
they
said
is,
we
have
some
questions
whether
we
constitutionally
can
take
away
those
rights
or
whether
it's
proper
to
take
away
those
rights,
but
in
any
case
we
have
clearly
not
done
so;
we've
preserved
whatever
rights
existed...
not
extradition
act
rights;
some
states
didn't
have
an
extradition
act;
then
there
were
no
extradition
act
rights
to
preserve;
but
we've
preserved
whatever
is
there.
finally,
interpreting
the
extradition
act
this
way
has
the
great
benefit
of
avoiding
some
tough
constitutional
questions.
i'm
assuming...
and
i
do
assume
this...
that
this
is
an
interstate
compact
and
that
it's
subject
to
interpretation
by
this
court;
then
this
court
has
ample...
the
worst
that
could
be
said
about
the
position
that
i'm
taking
is
that
perhaps
the
act
has
an
ambiguity.
i
don't
think
there
are
any
ambiguities.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
you
give,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
give
them
weight
when
deserved
on
straight
federal
constitutional
questions.
there
have
been
some
notable
decisions
from
state
courts--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--there
have
been
state
courts
which
have
interpreted
federal
statutes.
they
have
a
right
to
under
the
whole
federal
system,
and
this
court
reads
them,
and
if
they're
well
reasoned,
it
follows
them.
but
there
is
no
more
reason
to
follow
a
state
court
decision
in
this
case
than
there
would
be
to
follow
it
in
an
interpretation
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
think
it
didn't
even
realize,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
was
any
question
but
that
this
was
an
agreement
under
the
compact
clause,
and
therefore
it
was
free
to
interpret
it.
and
then
there's
no
constitutional
question.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
but
i
would
have
said
federal
common
law,
once
you
get
to
it.
once
you've
gotten
there
under
the
interstate
compact,
then
you
probably
use
federal
common
law,
and
in
this
case
common
sense
in
statutory
construction.
no
question,
there's
a
basic
constitutional
question,
do
you
get
here
under
the
compact
clause?
i
am
assuming
that
we're
here
and
obviously
if
we're
not,
then
the
case
may
have
to
go
back
to
the
3rd
circuit,
they
may
have
to
decide
the
constitutional
questions
they
thought
were
avoided.
i
do
want
to
make
a
couple
of
points
more.
i
think
that
the
court
should
be
aware,
as
it
probably
is,
because
its
extradition
act
cases
recognized
precisely
the
breadth
of...
or,
its
extradition
cases
which
have
interpreted
the
extradition
act
recognized
the
very
narrow
rights
which
that
act
gives.
you
have
four
rights;
they
are
all
fairly
pro
forma
rights,
but
on
occasion
extremely
important
rights.
you
have
a
right
to
find
out
that
the
documents
are
in
order,
that
you've
been
charged
with
a
crime
in
the
demanding
state,
that
you're
the
person
named
in
the
papers,
and
that
you're
a
fugitive...
or
on
occasion,
because
you
may
have,
under
another
section
of
the
act,
committed
the
crime
from
outside
the
state,
whether
you
come
within
the
act.
very
narrow
rights,
but
they
are
rights
you
have
to
be
heard.
i
suggest
that
for
that
reason
there
is
no
need
to
have
delay.
i
think
that
ms.
vickers
is
quite
right,
this
agreement
contemplates
prompt
transfer
and
that
delay
would
go
against
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement,
although
if
the
agreement
plainly
calls
for
certain
delays,
and
the
30-day
delay,
for
instance,
is
in
there...
this
question
plagued
the
court
somewhat
in
the
mauro
case
where,
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
white
doesn't
say
whether
this
is
an
interstate
compact
or
not--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--it
was
a
federal
statute
in
that
case;
that's
correct.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i
had
hoped
for
better--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--they
obtained
it
from
a
state
but
it
was--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--under
a
federal
statute;
that's
correct.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--was
a
detainer.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
in
any
case,
the
delays...
as
this
court
recognized
in
michigan
v.
doran
and
other
cases,
as
the
extradition
act
shows...
are
very
limited
delays.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
or
anybody
else
has
to
wait
the
30
days
while
you're
waiting
for
the
governor
not
to
disapprove.
because,
remember,
there
is
no
need
for
the
governor
to
send
any
paper
that
says,
you
may
now
transfer
this
prisoner,
as
there
is
in
the
extradition
act.
in
this
case,
or
in
fact,
under
extradition
practice
in
general...
in
this
case
the
governor
has
30
days
in
which
he
may,
if
there
is
a
public
policy
reason
to
do
so,
say
the
framers...
he
may
decide
to
disapprove.
there
are
always
those
rare
cases
where
you
don't
want
to
send
your
state's
prisoner
to
another
state
which
you
think
will
stomp
on
his
rights,
however
evil
we
may
think
him
and
however
much
we
may
want
him
in
prison,
we
don't
like
what
some
other
state's
doing.
the
governor
has
30
days
in
which
to
say,
not
this
one.
that's
all
he
can
do.
there's
no
reason
why
those
30
days
shouldn't
be
used
to
have
this
very
limited
hearing
of
the
same
sort
that
a
person
is
guaranteed
under
the
extradition
act.
so
there's
no
delay
involved.
there
are
very
limited
rights
involved,
and
it's
no
question
of
whether
this
court
is
going
to
be
giving
rights
to
prisoners
even
that
they
didn't
have
before,
because
a
state
which
doesn't
have
these
rights
for
its
citizens
generally
doesn't
give
them
to
prisoners
through
this
case.
so
that
it's
a
very
narrow
case
of
very
clear
interpretation,
and
it's
a
case
that
isn't
moot.
i
would
like
to
end
on
that
point.
it's
not
moot
for
two
reasons.
first,
we
don't
know
how
much
mr.
adams
may
be
entitled
to
in
the
way
of
damages.
he
began
with
allegations
which
have
never
been
dealt
with
because
this
isn't
a
12(b)
dismissal,
this
is
simply
an
answer
to
the
complaint
which
denied
some
allegations
and
then
said,
and
the
case
should
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
federal
claim.
he
alleges
that
he
had
an
alibi
witness,
his
mother,
who
would
have
spoken
up
for
him,
and
that
the
new
jersey
authorities
carefully
waited
until
her
death
and
as
soon
as
she
died
they
filed
these
papers.
it's
conceivable
that
he
pleaded
guilty
in
new
jersey,
maintaining
his
innocence
to
the
end
but
saying,
my
only
witnesses
who
could
have
defended
me
are
dead.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
are
conceivably
proven
in
this
case.
i
don't
assume
large
damages,
but
we
don't
know
that
the
damages
may
be
nominal;
under
carey
vs.
piphus,
whether
they
may
be
of
modest
substance;
whether
he
may
have
suffered
the
destruction
of
a
program
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
get
a
prison
job
on
which
he
could
have
made
a
little
bit
of
money;
you
don't
know
what
kinds
of
damages
might
be
involved.
he
also
has--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--if
he
has
damages?
mr.
james
d.
crawford
that's
correct.
in
addition--
mr.
james
d.
crawford
--i
trust
that
under
this
generally
framed
complaint
written
by
a
prisoner,
that
the
court
will
consider
it
as
a
request
for
declaratory
judgment.
assuming
it's
not
moot
for
his
damage
claim,
this
is
a
proper
time
for
a
court
to
declare,
this
statute
means
this.
and
that
would
be
the
other
grounds
on
which
it
is
not
moot.
i
see
no
mootness
here.
unless
there
are
any
questions
from
the
court,
i
think
i
have
covered
the
points
which
i
feel
need
to
be
made.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
unlike
the
uniform
act,
the
agreement
has
been
adopted
in
exactly
the
same
words
by,
i
believe,
47
states.
we
counted
wrong
in
the
brief.
mississippi
has
adopted
neither
of
these
acts
and
we
missed
it
when
we
counted,
as
i
think
the
court
below
did.
but
47
states
and
a
number
of
federal
jurisdictions,
puerto
rico
and
the
like,
have
adopted
it
in
exact
words.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
exact
words.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
none.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
i've
argued
them
in
the
brief...
and
at
that
time
i
had
argued
them
in
the
court
below;
they
are
plainly
posed
in
the
case,
they
plainly
had
to
be
argued
here
to
show
that
there
are
substantial
constitutional
reasons
for
this
interpretation...
but
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
since
the
3rd
circuit
has
never
spoken
on
those
questions,
if
you
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions,
they're
the
people
who
have
to
do
it.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
d.
crawford
those
other
constitutional
questions.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
thank
you
very
much.
