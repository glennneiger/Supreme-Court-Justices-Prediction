justice
john
paul

ms.
vickers,
could
you
help
me
with
one
question?
under
your
view
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers,
how
does
the
prisoner
know
that
he
has
a
right
to
file
a
motion
with
the
governor
within
that
30-day
period
asking
that
he
not
be
transferred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
this
particular
respondent
given
that
form?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
alleges
he
did
not
know
about
his
right
to
filing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whose
burden
would
it
be
to
show
that
he
received
a
piece
of
paper
that
would
tell
him
what
his
rights
were?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
don't
we
have
to
accept
his
claim
that
he
didn't
know
about
this
right
as
probably
a
valid
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
even
if
he
had
notice
of
the
detainer,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
had
notice
of
his
right
to
make
a
request
with
the
governor
within
that
30-day
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
that?
not
that
i
don't
have
confidence
in
what
you're
telling
me.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
explains
that
procedure
to
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
ms.
vickers,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
on
how
you
read
iv(d).
what
do
you
think
iv(d)
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
have
to
say
that?
i
mean,
if
paragraph
(a)
gives
him
those
rights,
do
you
have
to
put
in
another
paragraph
that
says,
this
article
doesn't
take
away
the
rights
we
just
gave
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the
rights
that
the
prisoner
gets
in
paragraph
(a)?
i
don't
find
that
he
gets
any
rights
in
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
right.
that
isn't
spelled
out
here,
is
it?
there's
nothing
in
here
that
says
he
has
the
right
to
do
that.
it
says
the
governor
has
the
right
to
withhold
the
transfer
if
he
petitions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say,
you
think
paragraph
(d)
was
intended
to
preserve
his
right
to
petition
the
governor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
right
given
by
article
iv(a)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
right
that,
if
it
exists,
exists
independently
of
iv(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
as
soon
as
you
admit
that
that
was
intended
to
preserve
that
right,
you're
saying
that
paragraph
iv(d)
is
preserving
things
not
granted
by
iv(a).
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
need
to
put
in
subparagraph
(d)
in
order
to
preserve
that
right
is
what
you're
saying,
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
what
iv(d)
accomplishes
if
it
does
not
preserve
rights
that
exist
independently
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
to
make
it
explicit,
you
then
concede
that
paragraph
iv(d)
preserves
rights
beyond
rights
which
are
granted
in
paragraph
(a)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
that
right
that
he
had
before
this
agreement
was
adopted
to
have
certain
procedural
protections
in
connection
with
extradition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
would
you
agree
that
before
the
agreement
on
detainers
was
adopted,
the
prisoner
had
certain
protections
under
the
extradition
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
really
three
ways
to
construe
that
language.
one
is,
it
refers
to
paragraph
(a),
the
30-day
right.
that's
your
view.
secondly,
it
could
refer
to
any
right
given
by
state
law
except
the
extradition
act.
and,
thirdly,
it
could
refer
to
any
right
given
by
other
laws
including
the
extradition
right.
those
are
the
three
alternatives.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
is
it
refers
just
to
paragraph
(a).
justice
powell
has
just
suggested,
well,
maybe
it
refers
to
any
right
given
by
state
law
except
the
extradition
act.
and
your
opponent
argues
the
third
alternative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
view
is
that
this
language
is
so
perfectly
clear
that
we
should
not
look
at
the
legislative
history
that
says
it's
not
intended
to
waive
the
rights
under
the
extradition
statute?
which
the
legislative
history
does
say
rather
clearly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
extradition
process,
which
are
designed
for
the
protection
of
prisoners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
crawford,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
supposing
after
the
3rd
circuit
decision
in
this
case
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
and
the
governor
of
new
jersey
got
together
and
said,
we
really
intended
the
result
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
holding
would
allow;
we
don't
want
to
have
extradition
procedures
apply
in
detainer
areas,
therefore
let's
adopt
an
amendment
to
the
agreement
between
these
two
states
which
specifically
says,
no
extradition-type
hearings
in
the
detainer
area.
would
there
need
to
be
the
approval
of
congress
for
such
an
agreement?
and
if,
on
the
second
question,
would
that
agreement
be
subject
to
construction
by
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
that
agreement
is
authorized
by
just
broad,
general
language
in
section
112:
"any
agreements
relating
to
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
within
the
authority
of
the
two
governors
to
say
that
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
interpreting
the
agreement
for
prisoners
who
are
in
custody
in
pennsylvania,
decisions
of
the
pennsylvania
courts
shall
control
whereas
with
respect
to
prisoners
in
custody
in
new
jersey,
the
decisions
of
the
new
jersey
state
courts
shall
control,
and
in
no
event
shall
the
federal
courts
depart
from
those
instructions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
two
questions.
first,
there
are
40-some-odd
states
that
have
adopted
the
agreement.
are
the
terms
of
the
agreement
precisely
the
same
for
everybody
who
signs
up?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
are
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--separate
amendments
such
as
i
discussed
with
you
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
secondly,
i
take
it
it's
your
view
that
if
we
don't
construe
the
statute
we
also
do
not
reach
any
constitutional
question
that's
been
argued
in
the
briefs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
the
disposition,
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
whether
or
not
there's
a
federal
question,
your
proposed
disposition
would
be
to
remand
for
consideration
of
those
constitutional
questions?
