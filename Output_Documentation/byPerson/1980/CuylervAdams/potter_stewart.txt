if
it
isn't,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
that
there
is
some
considerable
question
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
federal
question
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
3rd
circuit
did
so.
the
case
is
now
here.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
a
uniform
state
act,
even
though
the
same
act
has
been
enacted
by
the
legislatures
of
50
states,
is
not
a
federal
question.
that's
still
a
question
of
state
law,
even
though
the
law
is
identical
in
each
of
the
50
states,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though...
let's
assume
that
there's
an
identical
federal
law.
if
you
apply
it
within
a
state,
it's
still
a
matter
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
held
that.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
support
for
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
statute?
which
statute
are
you
talking
about?
there
are
two.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
the
extradition
act,
which
is
a
state
law,
and
then
there's
a
uniform...
there's
an
agreement
on--
justice
potter
stewart
--the
court
held,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
held
that
the
state
laws,
the
protections
extended
by
the
state
law,
were
extended
in
this
case
even
though
it
was
also
governed
by
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
left
with
the
question
that
brother
rehnquist
asked
you.
what's
the
question
of
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
but
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
the
law
of
pennsylvania
extended
certain
rights--
justice
potter
stewart
--to
the
respondent.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit
decided
this
case
on
the
ground
of
what
was
extended
to
your
client
by
the
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
not
by
the
agreement
or
the
compact
but
by
the
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
which
may
vary
from
state
to
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
held
on
this
that
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
state
law
accorded
your
client
certain
protections
and
rights,
and
that's
the
end
of
it,
and
isn't
that
a
state
law
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
to
be
found
in
footnote
1
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
on
page
3a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
"consent
of
congress
is
hereby
given
to
any
two
or
more
states
to
enter
into
agreements
or
compacts
for
cooperative
effort
and
mutual
assistance
in
the
prevention
of
crime
and
in
the
enforcement
of
their
respective
criminal
laws
and
policies,
and
to
establish
such
agencies,
joint
or
otherwise,
as
they
may
deem
desirable
for
making
effective
such
agreements
and
compacts.
"
that's
the
extent
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
not
quite
the
problem
in
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
obtained
the
prisoners
from
a
state.
justice
potter
stewart
--under
a
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
that
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
question
of
mootness.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
moot,
is
it?
