justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
crawford,
this
is
a
1983
suit,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
you
had
to
allege
causes
of
action
either
for
violation
of
the
federal
constitution--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--or
for
violation
federal
laws.
now
i
read
your
complaint
and
you
do
allege
the
violations
of
the
federal
constitution,
but
where
do
you
allege
violations
of
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
it.
if
there
was
a
federal
statute.
that's
my
problem.
where
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
precisely
did
the
congress,
besides
adopting
this
as
a
matter
of
controlling
federal
detainers
and
such,
what
process
does
the
compact
clause
require
before
an
interstate
agreement
becomes
a
federal
compact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
crawford,
what
was
the
1934
statute
that
you
said
authorized
specifically
the
adoption
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
cited?
4
u.s.c.
112,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
who
brought...
do
state
court
interpretations?
what
weight
should
we
give
that?
what
consideration
should
we
give?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
on
statutory
interpretations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
cuyler
v.
adams,
a
question
is
raised
of
the
relationship
between
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
and
the
uniform
criminal
extradition
act.
the
specific
issue
that
we
decided
is
whether
a
prisoner
confined
in
a
state
that
has
adopted
the
extradition
act
is
entitled
the
procedural
protections
of
that
act,
particularly
the
right
to
a
pretransfer
hearing
before
being
transferred
to
another
state
pursuant
to
article
iv
for
the
detainer
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
applied
federal
law
and
construed
the
two
statutes
as
entitling
the
prisoner
to
such
protections.
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
or
decide
a
constitutional
claim
which
was
also
urged.
in
contrast,
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
which
is
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
that
state
did
reach
the
constitutional
claims
and
held
that
state
prisoners
transferred
under
article
iv,
the
detainer
agreement,
had
no
constitutional
right
to
a
pretransfer
hearing.
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
view
was
that
the
constitutional
question
need
not
be
reached
because
the
detainer
agreement
is
an
interstate
compact
approved
by
congress
under
the
compact
clause
and
thus
as
a
federal
law
subject
to
federal
rather
than
state
construction.
we
affirm
the
holdings
of
the
court
of
appeals
both
in
its
ruling
that
the
detainer
agreement
is
a
federal
compact
subject
to
federal
construction
and
in
its
construction
that
the
statutes
are
to
be
construed
to
entitle
a
prisoner
before
being
transferred
of
the
procedural
protections
of
the
extradition
act.
our
reasons
for
reaching
that
result
are
set
forth
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today.
justice
rehnquist
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
