justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
vickers,
isn't
there
some
question
as
to
whether
this
is
actually
a
compact
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
in
view
of
the
language
in
the
multistate
tax
commission
case
saying
that
unless
the
agreement
between
the
states
is
one
which
would
alter
the
balance
of
power
within
the
union,
it
may
not
be
a
compact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
any
agreement
entered
into
by
party
states
necessarily
a
compact?
in
the
multistate
tax
commission
case,
there
was
certainly
an
agreement
entered
into
by
a
number
of
states,
and
i
believe
it
was
held
it
was
not
a
compact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
exactly
contrary
to
the
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania
state
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet,
in
the
uniform
commercial
code,
in
its
early
days,
which
was
also
adopted
by
a
large
majority
of
the
states,
the
highest
courts
of
various
states
interpreted
various
provisions
differently.
which
were
generally
corrected,
i
think,
by
recommendations
of
the
uniform
conference
on,
commissioners
of
uniform
state
laws.
but
those
were
never
treated
as
federal
questions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
uniform
laws
are
supposed
to
be
interpreted
uniformly
but
lots
of
state
courts
just
have
come
to
different
conclusions
on
rather
difficult
questions
of
statutory
construction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
holding
was
exactly
contrary
to
the
commonwealth
court's
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
doesn't
it
say
that
the
consent
of
congress
is
hereby
given
to
any
two
or
more
states
to
enter
into
agreements
or
compacts
for
cooperative
effort
and
mutual
assistance
in
the
prevention
of
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
112
provides
for
the
execution
of
agreements
or
compacts,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
multistate
tax
commission
then?
the
case
that
this
court
handed
down
two
or
three
years
ago,
where
the
thing
had
been
submitted
to
congress
and
congress
had
refused
to
approve
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
could
congress
by
writing
a
broad,
blanket,
general
approval
of
all
sorts
of
agreements
between
the
states
make
all
such
agreements
federal
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
3rd
circuit
didn't
avoid
any
constitutional
question
here.
it
decided
a
constitutional
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
reason
that
it's
free
to
interpret
it
is
because
it's
an
agreement
under
the
interstate
commerce
compact
clause,
according
to
you,
and
that
gives
rise
under
the
petty
case
to
a
body
of
constitutional
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
a
federal
statute.
