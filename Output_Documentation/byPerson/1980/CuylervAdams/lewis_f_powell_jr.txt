justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
whether
the
language...
any
right
that
the
prisoner
may
have...
couldn't
refer
to
just
any
right
under
state
law?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
not
limited.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
debating
that
point
at
the
moment;
there's
not
a
word
in
the
detainer
act
that
refers
to
the
extradition
act,
is
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
detainer
act,
no
specific
reference,
to
the
extradition
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
my
question
was
whether
or
not
the
language
that
you
have
been
discussing
with
justice
stevens
couldn't
be
construed
simply
as
applying
to
whatever
rights
may
exist
under
pennsylvania
law.
