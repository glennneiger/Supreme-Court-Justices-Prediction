and
the
states
in
adopting
the
detainers
agreement
referred
to
it
as
an
agreement.
they
entered
into
an
agreement
as
well,
and
that's
the

legislatures
join
agreements,
make
agreements.

quite
different
from
the
extradition,
uniform
extradition
act.
justice

of
course,
if
it's
the
case
that
an
interstate
compact...
the
interpretation
of
an
interstate
compact,
something
that's
admittedly
a
compact
is
a
matter
of
state
law;
that's
something
else
again,
but
you
think
you
have
the
best
of
it
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
but
what
is
the
authority
for
an
admitted
interstate
compact
being
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
was
whether
what
the
government
filed
with
the
state
authority--
justice
byron
r.
white
--exactly.
