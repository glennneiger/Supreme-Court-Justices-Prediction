justice
rehnquist
mr.
brady,
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
is
that
these
was
a
trial
in
the
superior
court,
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeal,
the
judgment
of
conviction
affirmed,
and
then
federal
habeas
sought.
is
that
right?
justice
rehnquist
did
the
state
court
of
appeal
pass
on
the
eyewitness
identification
issues
that
you've
been
discussing?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
9th
circuit
disagreed
with
the
state
court
of
appeal?
justice
rehnquist
and
the
state
court
of
appeal
here
did
treat
the
matter
on
the
merits,
did
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
but,
so
far
as
raising
the
matter
beyond
the
state
court
of
appeal,
say
to
bring
it
to
this
court,
the
defendant
would
have
been
perfectly
free,
i
take
it,
to
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
merits,
since
the
state
court
of
appeal
had
discussed
the
merits.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
if
that's
the
case,
the
procedural
waiver
of
failure
to
object
is
almost
meaningless
in
the
superior
court.
if
the
california
appellate
court
has
the
right
to
say,
even
though
there
was
no
objection,
we're
free
to
to
treat
this
on
the
merits,
and
we're
free
to
reverse
it
if
we
think
it's
flagrant
enough,
or
if
we
think
it
does
fall
under
the
federal
constitutional
ban.
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
it.
that
seems
to
me
somewhat
meaningless,
frankly,
because,
when
you
say
it
has
the
power
to
do
it,
do
you
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
would
reverse
it
if
it
did
that?
or
do
you
simply
mean
that
any
court
that
isn't
reviewed
further
is
going
to
have
its
judgment
enforced?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
not
because
of
wainwright
v.
sykes.
that's
because
of
2254,
isn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
mean
that
they
in
effect
overruled
your
suggestion
that
they
not
even
consider
the
claim
because
of
a
failure
to
object
in
the
trial
court,
if
they
considered
it
on
its
merits?
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
not
to
say
that
that's
not
their
2254(d)
argument
that
you're
talking
about
now,
is
it?
justice
rehnquist
and
following
up
justice
stewart's
question,
certainly
the
phraseology
makes
it
virtually
an
element
of
the
federal
habeas
cause
of
action,
does
it
not?
that
is
it's
almost
as
if
it
were
typical
bench
trial
negligence
causation
damages:
the
plaintiff
fails
to
prove
causation,
the
defendant
doesn't
object,
and
on
review
would
the
reviewing
court
be
prevented
from
assessing
or
reviewing
what
is
essentially
a
basic
element
of
the
cause
of
action?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
it
virtually
jurisdictional?
i
mean,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
confers
a
special
kind
of
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts
to,
in
effect,
review
the
same
findings
that
the
state
courts
made
and
come
out
differently,
if
there
is
a
constitutional
claim.
and
if
it's
jurisdictional
it's
really
our
obligation
as
well
as
counsel's
to
investigate
whether
the
jurisdictional
requirement
was
met.
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
troubled
me
about
judge
ely's
opinion
was
that
there
was
absolutely
no
reference
to
2254(d)
in
it.
and
if
you're
right,
it
seems
to
me
he
could
have
set
it
aside,
set
the
point
to
rest
in
a
footnote
saying
we're
dealing
here
with
questions
of
law
and
therefore
2254(d)
has
no
force
or
affect
or
he
could
have
dealt
with
it
in
some
other
way.
but
one
got
the
impression
that
neither
the
majority
nor
the
dissent
in
the
9th
circuit
had
even
any
knowledge
of
2254(d).
justice
rehnquist
you're
suggesting
then
that
basically
the
9th
circuit
and
the
state
court
of
appeal
applied
the
same
legal
test
for
eyewitness
identification?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
wouldn't
you
feel
that
there
was
some
obligation
on
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
the
state
court
of
appeal
was,
that
your
client
had
demonstrated
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
under
2254(d)
that
the
state
court
of
appeal
was
wrong?
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
read
the
subsection
8
of
2254(d)
then,
where
it
says
that,
where
a
factual
issue
was
determined
by
the
state
court,
the
burden
is
on
the
habeas
petitioner
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
it
was
wrong?
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
think
that
on
an
appeal,
say,
within
the
federal
system
that
doesn't
involve
federal
habeas,
that
a
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
the
admission
of
identification
testimony
by
a
district
court
only
if
it
found
that
it
was
clear
and
convincingly
wrong,
rather
than
just
wrong
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
rehnquist
on
a
direct
appeal,
yes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
california.
in
1973,
the
respondent,
robert
mata
was
convicted
in
a
california
state
court
of
a
first
degree
murder
of
one
of
his
fellow
inmates
of
the
california
correctional
institution.
at
his
trial,
eyewitnesses
identified
him
as
participating
in
the
murder.
the
california
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
which
the
jury
returned
rejecting
his
contention
that
a
pretrial
photographic
identification
used
by
the
police
had
violated
his
rights
to
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mata
didn't
appeal
his
conviction
to
the
california
supreme
court
but
later
raised
the
issue
in
stayed
habeas
proceedings.
the
california
state
courts
all
denied
relief.
on
december
9,
1977,
six
years
after
the
original
conviction,
mata
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
2254
which
is
a
part
of
the
united
states'
statutes.
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
he
again
raised
the
pretrial
identification
issue.
the
district
court
in
san
francisco
denied
his
petition,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
made
factual
findings
at
odds
with
those
earlier
made
by
the
california
court
of
appeals
when
it
affirmed
mata's
conviction
and
based
on
these
findings
concluded
that
the
photographic
identification
was
so
impermissibly
subjects
--
suggest
as
to
give
rise
to
a
very
substantial
likelihood
of
misidentification.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
our
concern
that
the
friction
necessarily
generated
by
federal
habeas
review
of
state
convictions
be
minimized
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
congressional
mandate
authorizes
a
federal
review
of
state
conviction.
this
case
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2254
which
provides
in
subsection
(d)
of
it
that
in
federal
habeas
proceedings
instituted
by
a
state
prisoner,
factual
determinations
made
by
a
state
court
after
hearing
on
the
merits
and
evidenced
by
a
written
opinion
are
presumed
to
be
correct
unless
one
of
seven
specific
convictions
is
found
to
exist
or
unless
the
court
determines
that
the
state
court's
factual
determinations
are,
to
quote
congress,
â€œnot
fairly
supported
by
the
record."
if
none
of
these
conditions
exist,
the
burden
rests
upon
the
habeas
application,
that
is
the
defendant
who
was
convicted
in
the
state
proceedings
to
establish
by
convincing
evidence
of
factual
determinations
made
by
the
state
court
were
erroneous.
when
congress
provided
2254
(d)
as
it
did
but
a
habeas
court
could
not
accept
in
these
limited
and
specific
circumstances
dispense
with
the
presumption
of
correctness
embodied
in
a
state
court's
factual
determinations,
it
contemplated
at
least
some
recent
written
reference
to
section
to
--
to
that
section
in
the
state
court
findings.
here,
we
find
it
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
2254
(d)
when
rejecting
the
state
court's
factual
determinations
because
the
court's
opinion
gives
no
indication
and
section
2254
(d)
was
even
considered.
we
now
hold
that
a
habeas
court
should
include
in
an
opinion
granting
the
writ,
the
reasoning
which
lead
it
to
reject
the
presumption
of
correctness
accorded
to
a
state
court's
factual
determinations
under
section
2254
(d).
such
a
statement
setting
forth
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
2254
(d)
will
have
the
obvious
value
of
an
--
enabling
a
reviewing
court
to
satisfy
itself
that
the
--
a
federal
habeas
court
has
complied
with
the
congressional
mandate
embodied
in
section
2254.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
vacated
and
the
cause
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackman
concurs
in
the
result
and
would
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
section
2254
(d).
mr
justice
brennan
with
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
joined,
have
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
from
the
opinion
of
the
court.
