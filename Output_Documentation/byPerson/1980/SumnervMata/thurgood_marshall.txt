--mr.
attorney
general,
what
about
the
possibility
of
a
lineup?
there
wasn't
any
problem
in
having
a
lineup
if
you
wanted
one,
was
there?
is
there
any
reason
why
they
didn't
use
a
lineup?
justice
marshall
it
wasn't
for
the
lack
of
people.
justice
marshall
well,
that
wouldn't
have
stopped
them
from
getting
in
a
lineup.
justice
marshall
but
the
question
was
never
gone
into
by
anybody?
justice
marshall
i
thought
one
of
the
three
did
ask
for
a
lineup.
justice
marshall
but
it
never
was
explained
in
this
record
why
his
request
was
refused.
justice
marshall
my
question
was,
was
it
ever
explained?
justice
marshall
i
thought
mr.
brady
said
it
was
in
a
response
that
they
filed.
