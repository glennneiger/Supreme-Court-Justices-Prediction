chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
summer
v.
mata.
mr.
brady,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
where
did
that
take
place?
chief
justice
burger
what
did
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
hold
on
the
habeas
corpus
hearing?
they
denied
relief.
they
found
that...
on
a
fairly
conclusory
opinion
found
although
the
identification
procedures
used
were
deficient
in
some
respects,
nonetheless,
taken
as
a
whole,
the
identification
evidence
was
still
reliable
and
was
still
properly
admitted.
so,
by
the
time
this
case
got
to
the
9th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
three
courts
had
held
that
there
had
been
no
miscarriage
of
justice:
the
state
trial
court,
the
state
court
of
appeal,
the
federal
district
court,
is
that
right?

justice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
brady?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
sumner
against
mata
will
be
announced
by
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
