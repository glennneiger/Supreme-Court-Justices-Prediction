mr.
ezra
hendon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
procedural
issues
in
this
case
need
not
detain
us
terribly
long.
what
we
have
here
is,
in
the
first
place,
procedural
issues
brought
before
this
court
which
have
not
been
timely
presented
in
the
courts
below.
so
far
as
the
record
which
we
have
here
is
concerned,
there
appears
to
be
no
indication
that
the
argument
that
the
procedural
default
bars
federal
review
was
ever
raised
in
the
district
court.
the
only
thing
that
we
have
is
a
bare
assertion
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
that
it
was
orally
argued.
there
is
no
oral
transcript
of
those
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
i
personally
did
not
handle
the
case
in
the
district
court,
and
so
far
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
the
court
is
aware--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--i
think
what
he
said
was
that
their
2254(d)
argument
was
in
the
brief
which
they
filed.
the
argument
that
the
supposed
procedural
default
bars
federal
review,
so
far
as
the
record
that
is
before
this
court
demonstrates,
was
never
raised
in
the
district
court.
in
any
event,
even
if
it
was
raised,
if
you
read
their
brief
carefully,
what
you
conclude
is
that
what
was
raised
was
a
concession
that
they
are
foreclosed
from
asserting
any
procedural
default
argument,
and
in
any
event
it
was
never
raised
in
the
9th
circuit.
so
that
the
issue
is
simply
not
properly
before
the
court,
and
even
if
it
were
properly
before
the
court,
as
i
understand
the
remarks
of
counsel
here
this
morning,
he
seems
to
have
indicated
that,
he
seems
to
have
agreed
that
the
argument
was
presented
to
the
state
court
of
appeal,
he
seems
to
have
conceded
that
the
state
court
of
appeal
had
the
power
to
reverse
the
conviction
based
on
the
argument
on
the
merits
that
was
presented,
and
given
those
two
concessions
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
there
is
simply
no
federal
interest.
there
is
no
interest
in
comity
that
is
advanced
by
a
federal
court
in
essence
regarding
a
state
court
ruling
which
purports
to
be
on
its
merits
as
a
mere
gratuity,
and
that's
the
language
that
counsel
uses.
mr.
ezra
hendon
not
as
a
matter...
it
would
not
bar
the
federal
court,
procedurally
to
bar--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--on
the
merits,
yes.
i
would
say
that
that
is...
that
if
the
conclusion
is
that
it
was
a
tactical
decision,
then
clearly
counsel
can't
get
the
benefit
of
both
ends
of--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--yes,
this
is
one
of
the
unresolved
issues
of
this
case.
it's
unresolved
because
neither
lower
court
ever
reached
it,
and
it
is
not
presented,
as
i
read
the
papers
here,
in
this
court,
as
an
alternate
ground
for
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeal
by
the
petitioner.
i
don't
understand
them
to
be
arguing
that
even
if
the
identification
is
bad
the
court
of
appeal's
judgment
must
be
reversed
because
there
was
a
tactical
decision
not
to
object.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no;
no,
that's
not
their
2254(d).
i
suppose
what
this
court...
well,
if
this
court
were
inclined
to
consider
that
matter
on
its
merits,
i
suppose
the
appropriate...
first,
the
court,
of
course,
would
have
to
find
that
the
identification
was
improper,
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
identification.
if
the
court
were
then
to
go
on
and
consider
that
the--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--oh,
i
see.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
is
whether
the
identification
is
proper
or
not,
and
to
resolve
that
question
we
look
to
all
of
the
factors
that
exist
in
the
case
with
regard
to
the
identification
itself.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
i
think
that
assumes
the
ground
of
the--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--we
did,
below.
that
is--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--we
did,
below,
yes.
and
that
was
not
resolved.
mr.
ezra
hendon
it
was
not
resolved
in
the
9th
circuit
because
the
9th
circuit
decided
that
the
identification
was
improper.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
the
court
takes
the
first
step
and
decides
that
the
identification
was
improper,
and
is
still
concerned
about
the
failure
to
object,
then
i
suppose
an
appropriate
course
would
be
to
remand
for
further
consideration
on
whether
there
was
a
tactically
based
failure
to
object.
now,
with
regard
to
the
2254(d)
argument,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
again
indicates
that
that
is
not
properly
preserved
for
review
in
this
court.
it
was
raised
in
the
federal
district
court.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
9th
circuit
until
after
the
case
had
been
decided.
and
i
simply
suggest
that
this
is
not...
to
reach
that
question,
this
procedural
question
on
its
merits,
is
basically
to
reward
a
kind
of
off-again-on-again
way
of
approaching
procedural
issues.
mr.
ezra
hendon
that
may
well
be.
that,
i
don't
think...
with
all
due
respect...
speaks
to
the
question
of
whether
that
issue
was
properly
preserved
for--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--yes?
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
if
this
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
in
every
federal--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--i
suppose
so
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
no,
i
don't
think
that
they
would
be
precluded
from
reaching
it.
it
has
always
been
my
understanding,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
authority
which
suggests
that
there
is
a
sua
sponte
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
federal
district
court
or
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
to
reach
that
question.
and
i
think
this
court
would
be
breaking
new
ground
if
it
were
to
decide
that.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
if
the
conclusion
is
that
it
is
jurisdictional,
then
you
are
correct.
i
am
not
aware
of
authority
which
holds
that
it
is,
and
i
think
in
any
event
it's
of
no
moment
here
because
i
don't
think
we're
dealing
truly
with
conclusions
of
fact;
i
don't
think
these
are
fact
findings
that
we're
dealing
with.
i
think
we're
dealing,
properly
understood,
with
conclusions
of
law,
and
i
think
that
as
i
read
justice
powell's
footnote
in
neil
v.
biggers,
i
think
in
an
extremely
similar
context
he's
held
as
much.
i
think
that
what
we're
dealing
here
is
not
so
much
with
the
findings
of
fact
as
we
are
with
the
conclusions,
the
constitutional
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
those
findings.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
they
had
no
knowledge
of
it,
and
didn't
think
of
it,
because
counsel
never
brought
it
to
their
attention.
whether
it
was
jurisdictional
or
not,
i
think
that's
the
explanation
for
why
it's
not
addressed.
if
this
court
is
inclined
to
go
ahead
and
treat
this
procedural
issue
on
its
merits,
then
it
has
to
essentially
substitute
itself
for
the
9th
circuit
and
draw
its
own
conclusions.
my
point
here
is
that
the
conclusions
which
you
have
to
draw
are
that
what
the
9th
circuit
was
dealing
with
was
conclusions
of
law,
the
constitutional
significance
of
facts.
it
was
not
going
ahead
and
finding
any
new
facts
on
its
own,
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion,
regardless
of
whether
the
2254(d)
issue
is
addressed
on
its
face.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
i
am.
mr.
ezra
hendon
that's
right.
primary
historical
facts.
i
think
that's--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--yes.
well,
yes,
but
here
you
have
the
wrinkle
that
there
was
no
objection
in
the
trial
court
and
the
argument
that's
being
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
the
finder
of
fact
in
that
situation
is
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes.
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
but
in
addressing
the
question
of
which
primary
facts
we
ought
to
defer
to,
which
we
are
not
to
defer
to--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--there
was
no
discussion,
so
that's
why
it's
difficult
to
identify
them.
now,
with
regard
to
the
merits,
i...
as
i
understood
counsel
to
be
speaking
this
morning...
i
find
that
i
have
no
special
objection
to
the
test
that's
proposed
here,
that
is
we
look
first
to
suggestiveness,
secondly
we
look
to
necessity
and
we
ask
the
question
with
regard
to
suggestiveness
whether
these
identification
procedures
could
have
been
suggestive.
and
with
that
statement
i
think
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
identify
what
i
regard
to
be
the
issue
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
manson
v.
brathwaite
and
in
neil
v.
biggers,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
in
eyewitness
identification
cases
is
suggestiveness
and
reliability,
and
that
the
issue
that's
raised
by
this
case
is
what
a
court
may
properly
consider
in
passing
on
the
question
of
whether
a
given
identification
is
suggestive
and
reliable.
mr.
ezra
hendon
the
same
as
each
other,
each...
as
each
other?
mr.
ezra
hendon
yes,
i
would
say
that
that's--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--i
think
that
the
only
obligation
that
the
federal
court
had
was
to
apply
the
law,
the
proper
law,
whatever
this
court
finds
it
to
be,
to
not
substitute
its
findings
of
fact
for
those
that
already
were
made,
and
to
draw
constitutional
conclusions
from
them.
if
the
constitutional
conclusion
that
the
federal
court
of
appeals
reaches
is
different
from
the
conclusion
that
the
state
court
of
appeal
reached,
then
that
issue
will
be
resolved
here,
but
i
don't
think
they
had
any
independent
obligation
to
apply
a
different
standard,
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
if
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
i
think
the
only
obligation
was
to
apply
the
law
and
to
draw
their
conclusions
from
it.
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
is
a
part
of
the
already
existing
legal
standard,
and
that
by
implicitly,
by
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
it
came
to
here,
the
9th
circuit
has
in
essence
said
that.
mr.
ezra
hendon
you're
asking
me
whether,
on
a
direct
appeal,
and
in
a
federal
case?
mr.
ezra
hendon
well,
i
have
to
plead
ignorance
on
that
your
honor.
i
do
not
practice
in
federal--
mr.
ezra
hendon
--i
think
that's
the
point
that
i
have
been
trying
to
make,
or
i
tried
to
make
at
the
outset
of
justice
rehnquist's
question,
that
the
obligation
of
the
reviewing
court
is
to
apply
the
legal
standard
that
this
court
tells
it
to
apply.
mr.
ezra
hendon
you
have
that
here
too.
mr.
ezra
hendon
you
have
that
here
too.
i
don't
think
there's
any
problem
with
the
record
in
that
regard.
this
is
a
fully
litigated
issue
and
you
have
a
complete
record
on
the
eyewitness
identification
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
dispute
between
the
parties
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
essentially
whether
the
court
of
appeals
ought
to
have
been
free
to
consider
necessity,
the
lack
of
necessity,
and
particularly
the
failure
to
conduct
a
lineup.
now,
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
the
court
ought
to
have
been
free
to
do
it,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
the
test
that
this
court
has
established
in
manson
and
in
neil
is
totality
of
the
circumstances.
a
court
looks
to
all
of
the
circumstances
and
so
long
as
it
predicates
its
findings
on
reliability,
so
long
as
it
looks
to
reliability,
and
so
long
as
reliability
is
the
bottom
line,
then
i
read
this
court's
opinions,
especially
in
manson
and
neil,
to
conclude
that
any
circumstance
may
be
considered
by
a
court
so
long
as
it
goes
to
reliability.
now,
here
in
this
case
you
have
a
witness
who
is
essentially
saying,
i
cannot
make
an
identification
from
photographs,
i
need
to
see
a
lineup.
you
also
have
no
reason
why
a
lineup
could
not
have
been
conducted.
let's
assume,
at
least,
that
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
parties
on
that
question.
but
let's
assume,
for
the
moment,
that
there
is
no
explanation,
there
is
no
valid
explanation
for
why
a
lineup
could
not
be
conducted.
and
it
seems
to
me
very
obvious,
under
those
facts,
that
the
failure
to
conduct
a
lineup
is
a
factor
going
to
reliability.
we
all
know,
and
this
court
has
held,
that
lineups
are
more
reliable
than
photographic
identification
where
you
have
a
witness
saying,
i
cannot
make
an
identification
from
a
photograph,
it's
too
old,
the
photographs
are
in
black
and
white.
where
you
have
a
witness
who's
saying
that,
and
saying,
i
need
to
have
a
lineup,
then
it's
perfectly
proper
for
a
court
to
consider
the
failure
to
conduct
a
lineup.
and
i
think
if
you
read
the
petitioner's
briefs
in
this
case,
you
see
that
there
has
been
a
subtle
shift
from
the
opening
brief
to
the
closing
brief.
what
petitioner
had
been
arguing
at
the
outset
and
what
is
essentially
the
position
that,
as
i
read
the
5th
circuit
cases,
has
been
adopted
in
the
5th
circuit,
is
that
you
do
not
look
to
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
passing
on
suggestiveness.
what
you
look
to
is
the
photo
spread
by
itself.
you
don't
look
beyond
the
photo
spread,
and
you
look
to
the
photo
spread
on
its
face.
well,
that
assumes
that
so
long
as
you
have
a
photo
spread
which
is
fair
on
its
face,
then
you
never
get
beyond
it
and
you
never
get
to
the
second
step,
which
is
reliability.
and
i
think
a
few
simple
examples
ought
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
that
simply
cannot
be
the
case.
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
photo
spread
which
is
fair
on
its
face,
but
that
the
police
officer
is
saying
to
the
witness,
this
is
the
person.
look
at
photograph
number
three,
don't
you
think
that
looks
like
him?
now,
i
think
everybody
would
concede
that
in
a
circumstance
such
as
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
suggesting
a
particular
identification
to
a
witness
was
a
factor
that
properly
could
be
considered
in
passing
on,
(a)
suggestiveness,
and
(b)
reliability.
and
i
think
that's
essentially
what
was
done
in
this
case.
i
think
that
you
have
peculiarity,
a
peculiar
fact
situation
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
witness
saying,
i
cannot
make
an
identification
from
a
photograph,
i
need
to
see
a
lineup.
i
think
that
that's
one
factor
to
be
considered
along
with
many
others
that
exist
in
this
case
that
point
to
a
suggestive
identification.
you
have,
for
example,
the
police
officers
telling
the
witnesses
who
made
identifications...
i
think
the
record
will
bear
out
the
conclusion
that
the
initial
identifications
that
were
made
by
witness
almengor
were
positive
identifications.
he
identified
someone
by
the
name
of
"bogus
pete"
nunez,
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
offense,
and
the
guard
said
to
him,
no,
no,
it
can't
be
bogus
pete,
bogus
pete
wasn't
in
the
prison
at
the
time.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
what
the
police
are
interested
in
is
simply
the
identification
that
the
witness
presents
to
them
rather
than
the
one
that
they
want
to
orchestrate,
they
will
not
point
out
wrong
choices.
and
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
in
several
of
its
cases
that
it
will
not
do
that.
secondly,
they
removed
all
choices
that
they
thought
were
wrong.
the
other
witnesses,
the
other...
almengor
also
pointed
out
other
people
who
simply
magically
disappeared
from
subsequent
show-ups.
their
photographs
just
never
recurred
again.
i
think
the
record
also
supports
the
fact
that
the
three
defendants
who
were
ultimately
identified
were
brought
before
the
holding
cell
in
a
very
suggestive
way
so
that
this
also
focused
the
attention
of
the
witnesses
on
them.
these
are
all
factors
which
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
considered.
i
think
if
you
read
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion,
it
considered
all
proper
factors,
it
applied
an
appropriate
standard,
and
it
came
to
the
only
conclusion
that
i
think
it
could
have
come,
which
was
that
you
had
a
very
volatile,
tense
situation,
there
was
an
interest
in
identifying
somebody,
in
getting
somebody
incarcerated
for
these...
this
offense,
and
they
just
picked
out
the
three
people
that
they
thought
were
most
conducive
to
being
convicted.
now,
i
think
if
anything
proves
the
necessity
for
a
lineup
in
this
case,
nothing
does
it
so
much
as
the
fact
that
after
one
of
the
witnesses
said,
i
need
to
see
a
lineup,
i
cannot
make
identifications
in
photographs.
they
finally
showed
him
the
last
photo
spread,
he
points
to
the
three
defendants,
they
take
him
out,
he
has
a
chance
encounter
with
the
defendant
vargas,
who
is
taking
a
shower,
he
sees
him
live,
and
he
says,
my
god,
i
identified
the
wrong
person,
and
he
turns
to
the
guard
and
he
says,
i
picked
out
the
wrong
person,
this
is
not
the
person
who
did
it.
now,
this
is
a
live,
he
sees
him
live.
this
is
the
only
opportunity
that
he
had
to
see
him
live
and
he
said,
i
picked
out
the
wrong
person.
the
guard
said,
in
effect,
tell
it
to
the
judge.
and
he
goes
to
court,
and
here
we
are
today.
i
think
that
is
palpable
proof
of
the
fact
that
these
witnesses
indeed
needed
a
lineup,
that
you
could
not
have
a
reliable
identification
in
this
case
without
a
lineup,
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
considered
that
factor
in
reversing
this
conviction.
thank
you.
