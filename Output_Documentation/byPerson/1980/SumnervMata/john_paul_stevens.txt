justice
stevens
when
did
you
first
raise
that
argument?
justice
stevens
did
the
trial
court...
i
understand
there
was
no
objection
to
the
testimony
about
the
photo
identification
procedure.
is
it
also
true
there
was
no
objection
to
the
in-court
identification?
justice
stevens
but
you
didn't
argue
as
a
matter
of
california
procedure
that
they
therefore
could
not
raise
this
whole
problem
in
the
court
of
appeal,
did
you?
that
they'd
waived
their
constitutional
objection
by
failure
to
object
in
the
trial
court?
justice
stevens
mr.
hendon,
is
there
not
a
federal
interest,
even
assuming
for
the
moment
there
were
no
california
contemporaneous
objection
rule
at
all?
not
just
that
they
didn't
waive
it?
and
supposing
a
federal
judge
reviewing
the
state
record
formed
the
conclusion
that
as
a
matter
of
trial
tactics
the
defense
counsel
decided
he
would
not
make
any
objection
to
admissibility
of
the
identification
evidence,
because
he
thought
he
might
have
a
greater
chance
of
obtaining
a
not
guilty
verdict
by
cross-examining
the
witnesses
at
great
length
and
trying
to
show
improper
police
behavior,
and
so
forth.
would
not
the
federal
court
in
its
interest
in
trying
to
reach
the
right
result
properly
take
that
trial
strategy
into
account?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
it's
not
a
procedural
bar,
but
should
it
not
be
a
factor
that
should
be
considered
in
the
overall
picture
of
whether
due
process
was
denied?
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
a
tactical
decision
here?
surely
the
objection
is
one
that's
well
known
to
trained
defense
lawyers.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
follows.
i'm
suggesting
in
the
analysis
of
the
question
whether
there
was
constitutional
error
committed--
justice
stevens
--by
letting
this
evidence
into
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
one
could
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
no
objection
was
made
and
conceivably
that
that
was
a
tactical
decision
by
counsel.
it's
hard
for
me
to
reach
a
conclusion
that
there's
a
deprivation
of
due
process
in
receiving
unobjected
evidence,
evidence
to
which
there
was
no
objection
at
all,
if
the
objection
was
available
to
counsel.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
even
if
it's
improper,
no
denial
of
due
process
takes
place
unless
it's
put
into
the
record
of
the
trial.
you
can
do
everything,
all
the
suggestive
material
you
wanted
in
the
police
station
if
the
witnesses
never
testify.
there
can't
be
any
denial
of
due
process
from
that.
the
due
process
issue
only
arises
at
trial,
as
i
understand
the
constitutionality.
justice
stevens
so
that
it
seems
to
me
the
critical
point
is
when
the
evidence
is
offered.
and
if
it's
improperly
received,
perhaps
a
denial
of
due
process
could
take
place.
justice
stevens
but
it's
hard
to
find
a
denial
of
due
process
by
the
admission
of
evidence
to
which
competent
counsel
doesn't
make
any
objection.
justice
stevens
you
don't
challenge
the
competency
of
counsel?
justice
stevens
i'm
sorry.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
you
also
contend
it
only
applies
to
determinations
by
the
finder
of
fact
who
actually
saw
the
witnesses?
that's
a
separate
question.
justice
stevens
but
wouldn't
you
contend
that
2254(d)
simply
doesn't
apply
unless
there's
a
determination
by
a
trial
court?
justice
stevens
i
thought
you'd
made
that
argument.
there
was
at
least
an
implicit
determination
by
the
trial
court
when
he
admitted
the
evidence,
wasn't
there?
didn't
he
necessarily,
by
implication--
