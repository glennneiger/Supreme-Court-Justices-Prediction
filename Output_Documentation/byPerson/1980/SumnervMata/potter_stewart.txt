justice
stewart
and
although
the
federal
district
court
talked
about
irregularities,
didn't
it?
justice
stewart
but
neither
the
federal
district
court
nor
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
your
2254(d)
argument
at
all,
did
they?
did
they
mention
it?
justice
stewart
isn't
your
position
a
little
bit
inconsistent?
if
this
was
just
a
meaningless
discussion,
then
2254(d)
is
of
doubtful
applicability,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
this
is
a
totally
inconclusive
discussion,
and
even
if
the
state
court
of
appeal
had
found
the
identification
procedures
wholly
improper
and
unconstitutional,
your
present
submission
is
it
had
no
power
to
reverse
the
conviction,
and
therefore
why
is
2254(d)
applicable
at
all
if
this
is
just
an
inconclusive,
meaningless
discussion?
justice
stewart
well,
they
found
no
error
in
the
admission
of
the
identification
evidence,
which
would
lead
to
no
reversal
of
the
conviction.
justice
stewart
don't
you
concede
the
possibility
that
2254(d)
may
impose
an
obligation
upon
federal
courts
regardless
of
whether
or
not
anybody
raises
the
point?
justice
stewart
well,
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
mention
2254(d)--
justice
stewart
--and
if
2254(d)
does
impose
some
obligation
upon
federal
courts
to
consider
it,
and
to
find
an
exception
to
its
generalized
application...
and
it
lists
various
exceptions;
eight
of
them,
i
think...
what
does
it
matter
if
anybody
raised
it?
justice
stewart
well,
do
you
concede
the
possibility
that
2254(d)
might
impose
some
obligation
upon
federal
courts,
in
federal
habeas
corpus
courts?
justice
stewart
you
are
suggesting,
then,
that
2254
just
doesn't
address
itself
to
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law?
justice
stewart
it's
just
purely
historical
facts
that
it
relates
to?
justice
stewart
--find
that
there
was,
it
was
perfectly
proper
to
admit
the
evidence,
and
therefore
that
the
evidence...
it
was
not
unconstitutional
to
admit
the
evidence?
justice
stewart
there
was
no
discussion,
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
as
such.
justice
stewart
well,
in
a
direct
appeal
of
a
federal
criminal
conviction,
a
federal
reviewing
court
sets
the
conviction
aside
if
it
finds
that
there
was
error
in
the
trial,
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
ever
been...
it
doesn't
need
to
find
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence;
it
just
finds
that
there
was
error
in
the
trial,
error
in
the
admission
of
evidence
or
error
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
or
error
somewhere
else.
justice
stewart
generally
there's
no
great
argument
about
what
happened
at
the
trial
because
you
have
the
trial
record
and
you
know
how
the
judge
did
instruct
the
jury,
and
you
know
what
was
admitted
in
evidence,
and
so
on.
justice
stewart
so,
if
you
conclude
that
that
was
erroneous,
something
about
it,
that
it
was
prejudicial,
a
judgment
of
conviction
is
set
aside.
