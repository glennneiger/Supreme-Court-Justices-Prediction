mr.
thomas
a.
brady
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
or
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
9th
circuit.
that
court
reversed
an
order
of
the
district
court
which
denied
the
respondent
mata's
habeas
corpus
petition.
the
court
further
ordered
that
on
any
retrial
of
the
respondent
mata
evidence
of
identifications
of
him
by
two
eyewitnesses
could
not
be
admitted.
this
defendant
and
his
two
codefendants--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--as
i
read
the
opinion,
your
honor,
it
would
apply
to
both.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
it
is
my
reading
of
the
opinion
that
it
excluded
both
identifications,
both
evidence
of
in-court
identifications
and
evidence
of
identifications
from
a
group
of
photographs.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
that
is
correct.
this
defendant
and
his
two
codefendants
by
the
names
of
david
gallegos
and
salvador
vargas
were
convicted
in
a
california
court
of
the
first-degree
murder
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
leonard
arias.
the
three
defendants
were
members
of
the
"mexican
mafia"
prison
gang.
victim
arias
was
a
member
of
a
rival
gang.
there
was
evidence
introduced
that
these
three
defendants
accepted
an
assignment
from
the
mexican
mafia
hierarchy
to
kill
mr.
arias
because
mr.
arias
had
stabbed
another
mexican
mafia
member
at
the
california
prison
at
san
quentin.
there
was
further
evidence
that
they
armed
themselves
and
that
they
stated
their
intention
to
kill
mr.
arias.
the
killing
itself
occurred
at
approximately
1:45
p.m.
of
the
19th
of
october,
1972.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
it
occurred
in
one
of
the
inmate
dormitories
at
the
california
correctional
institution
at
tehachapi.
at
the
time
there
was
a
correctional
officer
present
in
this
dormitory.
he
estimated
that
there
were
between
30
and
35
inmates
there
at
the
time.
although
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
interviewed
many
of
these
inmates,
only
three
of
them
would
ever
admit
that
they
had
witnessed
the
killing.
each
of
these
three
were
hesitant
to
some
greater
or
less
degree
to
admit
that
they'd
seen
anything
and
hesitant
to
admit
that
they
were
able
to
identify
anyone.
the
three
eyewitnesses
who
testified
at
trial
were
inmates
and
were
residents
of
this
particular
dormitory.
the
first
of
them
was
an
inmate
by
the
name
of
paul
childress.
the
defendant
does
not
now
contend
that
his
identification
testimony
was
improperly
admitted.
indeed,
mr.
childress
testified
that
he
previously
knew
the
defendant
and
mr.
gallegos
and
he
was
able
on
the
day
after
the
killing
to
identify
them
by
name,
and
to
select
their
pictures,
as
well
as
a
photograph
of
the
third
defendant
from
a
group
of
several
hundred
pictures
shown
to
him.
the
other
witnesses
were
inmates
by
the
name
of
rigoberto
almengor
and
jay
allen.
both
of
them
testified
that
they
were
walking
with
the
victim
when
he
was
suddenly
set
upon
by
three
men
armed
with
knives
who
appeared
to
have
been
waiting
for
him.
both
of
them
testified
that
this
fatal
struggle
took
several
minutes,
perhaps
as
long
as
four
minutes.
almengor
testified
that
at
one
point
during
it
he
struggled
briefly
with
the
defendant.
he
made
eye
contact
with
the
defendant,
the
defendant
broke
off
his
attack
on
the
victim
and
commenced
an
attack
on
mr.
almongor.
this
lasted
a
short
time.
thereafter
mr.
almengor
backed
off
from
the
defendant,
they
faced
each
other
from
a
very
short
distance,
mr.
almengor
then
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
victim,
but
once
again
he
and
mr.
mata
backed
off.
they
faced
each
other
from
a
short
distance,
and
at
this
point
almengor
indicated
that
he
wanted
no
part
of
this
struggle
that
was
going
on.
mr.
allen
testified
that
he
too
struggled
briefly
with
one
of
the
other
men
but
then
he
backed
off
a
short
distance
from
the
struggle
and
began
yelling
for
help.
on
the
day
of
the
killing
mr.
almengor
was
shown
several
hundred
pictures
of
inmates
at
the
institution.
from
these
he
was
able
to
narrow
it
down
to
a
group
of
four
of
them
which
he
said
were
similar
in
appearance
to
the
men
he
had
seen.
it
should
be
emphasized
that
his
identifications
at
this
time
were
not
positive.
in
fact,
he
selected
more
pictures
at
the
time
than
he
said
there
were
assailants.
mr.
allen
was
also
interviewed
this
day.
he
stated
that
he
did
not
want
to
get
involved
and
for
this
reason
he
told
the
prison
authorities
he
was
able
to
identify
no
one.
because
of
this
they
showed
him
no
pictures.
in
the
next
few
days
after
this
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
riot
was
occurring
at
the
prison
and
that
the
investigation
was
postponed
for
a
short
time
because
of
this.
finally,
on
the
27th
of
october,
approximately
eight
days
after
the
killing,
the
three
witnesses
were
shown
a
group
of
24
pictures
of
inmates.
this
was
people's
exhibit
23,
introduced
at
trial,
and
it
as
well
as
people's
exhibit
24,
which
i'll
mention
in
a
moment,
has
been
brought
before
this
court.
mr.
childress
was
able
to
identify
all
three
of
the
defendants
from
this
initial
photo
display.
mr.
almengor
identified
a
photograph
of
mr.
vargas
only.
again
his
identification
was
not
positive.
he
stated
that
the
pictures
that
he
was
looking
at
seemed
to
him
to
be
outdated
and
he
asked
the
prison
authorities
to
see
what
they
could
do
about
getting
some
new
pictures
for
him
to
view.
mr.
allen
saw
the
same
group
of
pictures
that
day.
he
was
able
to
identify
no
one.
he
too
commented
that
he
thought
new
pictures
would
be
helpful.
in
a
few
days
following
this
the
prison
authorities
attempted
to
take
new
pictures
of
a
number
of
inmates.
only
those
of
the
three
defendants
turned
out.
these
three
pictures
were
placed
in
a
different
group
of
15
pictures,
which
is
people's
exhibit
24,
which
were
shown
to
the
witnesses
on
the
30th
of
october.
the
identifying
information
on
these
pictures,
the
names
and
the
dates
the
pictures
were
taken,
that
was
covered
at
the
time.
at
this
point
both
allen
and
almengor
identified
all
three
of
the
defendants.
at
trial
the
two
of
them
stated
that
they
were
now
sure
when
they
saw
mr.
vargas
in
person
at
trial
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
people
who
attacked
the
victim.
they
remained
firm,
however,
in
their
identifications
of
the
defendant
and
mr.
gallegos.
i
believe
that
the
9th
circuit's
opinion
is
in
error
in
several
respects.
the
first
error
is
its
statement
of
the
standard
for
determining
the
admissibility
of
identification
evidence
in
a
case
where
pretrial
photographic
identification
procedures
have
been
used.
the
9th
circuit
stated
that
the
appropriate
standard
required
a
two-part
approach.
first,
a
court
should
look
to
the
necessity
for
use
of
photographic
identification
procedures.
here,
since
the
defendant
and
his
codefendants
were
state
prison
inmates,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
use
of
photographic
identification
procedures.
from
this
lack
of
necessity
it
proceeded
directly
to
a
determination
of
whether
there
had
been
a
likelihood
of
misidentification.
the
lack
of
necessity
was
said
to
be
an
important
factor
weighing
against
the
admissibility
of
their
identification
evidence.
it
is
our
position
and
our
belief
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
necessity
or
lack
of
necessity
for
use
of
a
particular
procedure
is
part
of
the
constitutional
standard.
indeed,
the
court
has
rejected
attempts,
most
recently,
in
manson
v.
brathwaite,
to
have
generalities
such
as
this
included
in
what
is
basically
a
fact-oriented
balancing
process.
the
court
has,
in
simmons
v.
united
states,
and
again
in
u.s.
v.
ash,
declined
the
opportunity
to
formulate
special
rules
in
cases
where
pretrial
photographic
identification
procedures
have
been
used.
the
court
has,
instead,
applied
what
we
believe
is
a
consistent
standard
of
due
process
fairness
in
all
cases
involving
the
use
of
pretrial
identification
procedures.
it
has
applied
the
same
standard
whether
photographic
identification
procedures
were
used,
whether
a
live
lineup
or
showup
was
used,
or
whether
there
was
a
combination
of
these
factors.
i
believe
that
this
court's
due
process
standard
focuses
on
two
things:
first,
the
suggested
nature
of
the
particular
pretrial
confrontation
involved
in
the
case;
and,
second,
the
reliability
of
the
identification
evidence.
we
believe
that
the
court's
consistent
treatment
of
all
these
situations
makes
it
clear
that
it
believes
that
due
process
does
not
require
that
a
particular
procedure
be
used,
or
that
the
use
of
one
procedure
as
opposed
to
another
should
be
penalized.
rather,
i
believe
the
court's
cases
require
only
that
the
procedure
which
is
actually
used
not
be
so
unfair
to
deny
a
defendant
due
process.
we
therefore
ask
the
court
to
reject
the
9th
circuit's
approach
and
to
affirm
the
approach
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
5th
circuit
and
by
the
majority
of
the
other
courts
which
have
considered
the
issue.
and
that
approach,
very
briefly
stated,
is
as
follows.
first,
if
the
defendant
objects
to
the
admission
of
identification
evidence,
a
court
should
first
ask
itself
whether
the
pretrial
identification
procedures
actually
used
have
been
so
impermissibly
suggestive
that
they
could
give
rise
to
a
very
substantial
likelihood
of
mistaken
identification.
the
focus
here
is
on
the
particular
identification
confrontation
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
it.
the
court
may
consider,
for
example,
any
circumstances
tending
to
suggest
that
the
witness
should
identify
a
particular
person
or
not
identify
a
particular
person.
it
may
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
the
extent
that
they
have
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
suggestiveness.
if
and
only
if
the
court
should
determine
that
the
pretrial
identification
procedures
used
were
so
impermissibly
suggestive
that
they
could
give
rise
to
a
very
substantial
likelihood
of
mistaken
identification,
does
it
become
necessary
to
determine
whether
in
fact
it
it
is
likely
that
they
had
this
effect.
in
making
this
latter
determination
the
focus
is
on
the
reliability
of
the
identification
evidence.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
court
applies
the
five
factors
stated
in
neil
v.
biggers,
and
restated
in
manson
v.
brathwaite,
and
any
other
factors
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
identification
evidence
is
reliable.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
sir,
it
did.
it
found
that
there
was
no
impermissible
suggestion
in
them.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
with
the
state
court
of
appeal,
and
also
with
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
the
district
court,
as
did
the
9th
circuit,
relied
solely
on
the
state
record.
there
was
no
evidence,
no
new
witnesses.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
well,
it's
our
position
the
9th
circuit
did
not
apply
the
same
standard
that
apparently
the
district
court
did,
or
the
state
courts.
neither
of
them
mentioned
the
concept
of
necessity.
the
only
cases
cited
in
either
of
the
lower
courts
were
this
court's
cases,
particularly
simmons.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
i
believe
we
would,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
another
one
of
the
reasons
which
brings
us
here,
our
belief
that
the
9th
circuit
did
not
apply
section
2254
when
it
should
have.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
sir.
the
record
suggests
several
reasons.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
no.
one
reason
appears
to
be
the
fact
that
a
riot
was
going
on
in
the
prison
at
that
time.
a
second
reason
appears
to
be
that
all
of
this
was
occurring
in
a
prison
which,
as
was
stated
in
judge
sneed's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
9th
circuit
and
has
heed
stated
in
many
other
places,
a
prison
is
a
unique
world
and
inmates
there
are
not
generally
very
favorably
disposed
to
come
forward
and
give
evidence
to
identify
other
prisoners
as
being
responsible
for
crimes.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
no,
it
would
not
physically
stop
them,
but
it
is
one
reason
why
a
decision
may
be
made
that
the
use
of
photographic
identification
procedures--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--no,
there
was
no
objection
to
the
admission
of
the
identification.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
one
of
the
three
men
mentioned
that.
this
was
on
the
27th
of
october,
i
believe,
after
he'd
seem
the
first
group
of
photographs.
thereafter
he
saw
a
second
group
of
photographs,
did
not
renew
the
request
for
a
lineup,
and
he
apparently
felt
that
the
second
group
of
photographs
was--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--it
was
alluded
to
at
one
time
only
by--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--no,
sir,
not
in
so
many
words.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
although
the
state
trial
court
was
not
expressly
called
on
to
resolve
the
issue.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
the
2254(d)
argument
was
first
raised
in
the
district
court,
in
our
return.
we
stated
at
that
time
that
the
findings
of
the
state
court
of
appeal
should
be
accorded
the
presumption
of
correctness,
mandated
by
2254.
we
said
that
this
was
necessary,
because
since
there
had
no
objection
at
trial,
the
trial
court
was
not
really
called
upon
to
make
fact-findings
regarding
this
identification
issue.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
well,
let
me
approach
this
this
way.
in
the
united
states
district
court,
we
argued
that
there
had
been
a
procedural
default
by
this
failure
to
object.
in
the
district
court,
however,
we
were
required
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
a
controlling
9th
circuit
case
which
would
hold
that
the
state
court
of
appeal
treatment
of
the
issue
substantively
would
act
as
a
forgiveness
of
any
default.
the
same
thing
held
true
in
the
9th
circuit.
they
could
not
argue
that
in
the
9th
circuit
because
there
was
controlling
9th
circuit
precedent
which
one
panel
could
not
overrule
another.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that...
well,
it
passed
on
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
identification
procedures
but
it's
our
position
that
by
so
doing
it
did
not
forgive
any
procedural
default.
california's
contemporaneous
objection
rule
does
not
preclude
a
state
appellate
court
from
considering,
from
discussing
a
constitutional
claim.
it
precludes
it
from
reversing
a
judgment
of
conviction
if
there
has
been
no
appropriate
objection.
it
is
our
position
that
in
order
to
forgive
a
procedural
default
a
state
appellate
court
must
not
only
discuss
the
issue
but
also
reverse
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
well,
that
is
one
of
the
questions
in
this
case,
your
honor,
whether
he
would
be,
or
would
have
been.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
the
state
court
of
appeal
here
found
itself
in
this
rather
no-win
situation.
it
had
on
the
one
hand
the
not
very
appetizing
prospect
of
foreclosing
the
defendant
from
relief
solely
on
procedural
grounds,
or
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
wanted
any
reviewing
courts,
any
federal
courts
to
have
the
benefit
of
its
views
to
find
out--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--let
me
say,
it
had
the
power
to
reverse
the
conviction
but
not
the
right.
and
i
think
the
court's
treatment
of
the
issue
on
the
merits
was
not
a
meaningless
discussion.
it
was
meant
to
inform
not
only
this
defendant
but
anyone
else
that
might
be
interested
in
this
case,
in
the
future,
of
what
the
court's
views
on
that
were,
what
it
believed
the
appropriate
constitutional
standard
was,
the
appropriate
conclusions.
for
this
reason
i
don't
believe
it
was
at
all
meaningless.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
in
my
previous
answer
i
attempted
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
power
to
reverse
the
judgment
and
the
right
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes,
i
relieve
that
is
what
i
mean,
that
the
court...
this
is
the
state
court
of
appeal...
would
be
able
to
reverse
it.
if
it
is
incorrect
in
doing
so,
if
the
matter
came
before
the
california
supreme
court,
it
should
reverse
the
state
appellate
court's
judgment.
but
from
all
this,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
necessarily
say
that
what
the
state
court
of
appeal
did
was
really
meaningless
or
worthless
or
kind
of
a
throwaway
sort
of
a
thing.
the
court
i
think
considered
the
issue
in
some
detail,
and
i
think
this
court's
previous
cases,
most
notably
wainwright
v.
sykes,
have
encouraged
the
state
appellate
courts
to
deal
with
issues
such
as
this
and
to
give
the
federal
courts
the
benefit
of
their
views,
the
benefit
of
what
thoughts
they
might
have
about
any
particular
state
procedures
or
state
laws
that
might
be
applicable
here.
and
i
think
it's
for
this
reason
that
the
federal
courts
should,
where
a
state
appellate
court
has
passed
on
a
constitutional
issue,
give
deference
to
the
decision
of
that
state
appellate
court.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
that's
correct.
but
in
wainwright
v.
sykes,
i
read
that
as
this
court
encouraging
the
state
appellate
courts
to
tackle
these
things
on
the
merits
and
not
really
to
stand
on
procedural
grounds
necessarily.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
well,
that
is--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--well,
that
is
my
point.
we
don't
really
know
from
their
opinion
whether
or
not
they
rejected
the
state
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
it
was
certainly
brought
to
their
attention
in
our
brief.
it's
a
very
well-known
point
in
california
that
would
not
have
escaped
them.
and
i
think
the
fact
that
they
considered
the
constitutional
claim
on
its
merits
but
did
not
reverse
the
conviction
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
forgave
the
procedural
default.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
i
do
not
think
you
can
necessarily
imply
that,
no,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
very
briefly.
if,
to
concede
at
the
moment
for
purposes
of
argument
that
the
state
court
of
appeal's
opinion
was
an
opinion
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue,
then
we
submit
that
that
court's
findings
should
be
accorded
the
presumption
of
correctness
of
section
2254(d).
we
raised
this
point
expressly
in
our
return
in
the
district
court,
and
this
appears
at
age
195
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
the
9th
circuit
we
raised
the
point
a
little
bit
differently.
we
were
at
that
point
reviewing
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
and
we
asked
the
9th
circuit
to
accord
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
which
as
far
as
we
could
see
had
given
appropriate
deference
to
the
state
court
of
appeal's
findings,
we
asked
the
9th
circuit
to
give
the
district
court's
findings
deference.
it
did
not.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
yes;
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--i
think
they
differed
on
the
historical
facts.
i
think
two
examples
will
show
this.
the
state
court
of
appeal
opinion
says,
in
so
many
words--
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
--he
apparently
does
not.
the
state
court
of
appeal
says
in
so
many
words,
there
was
no
influence
on
the
witnesses
by
the
investigating
officers.
the
9th
circuit
holds
precisely
to
the
contrary.
the
state
court
of
appeal
says
there
was
an
adequate
opportunity
for
the
witnesses
to
view
the
attackers
at
the
time
of
the
attack.
the
9th
circuit
doesn't
so
much
take
that
on;
it
says,
the
fact
that
there
was
this
knife
attack
going
on,
this
violence,
this
excitement,
that
very
likely
had
the
effect
of,
if
you
will,
taking
the
witness's
attention
away
from
the
men
in
front
of
him
so
that
very
likely
they
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
view
the
attack.
this
particular
finding
seems
to
be
a
general
purpose
one
made
up
by
the
9th
circuit.
it
could
apply
to
any
crime
of
violence.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
that
these
witnesses
said,
we
were
afraid,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
so
that
i
think
we
really
have
not
an
academic
exercise
here,
we
have
a
case
where
a
federal
appellate
court
has
very
really
found
that
it
should
be
a
fact
finder
in
a
case
where
there's
been
both
a
state
trial
court
determination,
state
appellate
court
determination,
and
also
a
district
court
determination.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
i
think
we
would,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
brady
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
it
was
on
or
two
strikes
against
us,
but
i
think
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
the
9th
circuit
were
correct
in
this,
i
still
do
not
think
we
would
be
over
the
line
into
where
we
would
have
a
constitutional
violation.
this
court,
i
think,
has
never
stated
the
appropriate
standard
better
than
in
the
foster
case.
it
asks,
is
this
the
man?
has
this
man
been
singled
out?
looking
at
the
circumstances
here,
i
think
this
court
cannot
conclude
that.
thank
you.
