justice
marshall
mr.
solicitor,
suppose
iowa
made
a
rule
of
difference
as
to
whether
it
was
raining
or
snowing,
because
there
is
a
difference?
justice
marshall
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
how
long
a
truck
is
in
sunny
weather,
but
in
rainy
weather
it
does
make
a
difference,
doesn't
it?
justice
marshall
i
will
remember
that
the
next
time
i
pass
one
on
the
road.
