justice
rehnquist
certainly
one
reason
you
might
not
want
to
adopt
it
is
that
trucks
would
in
that
event
avoid
iowa,
and
iowa
merchants
and
so
forth
get
profit
from
trucks
of
55-foot
length
coming
through
iowa.
that's
a
reason
why
they
might
not
want
to
do
it,
but
i'm
assuming
the
legislature
decides,
we'd
rather
have
safety
than
the
business
brought
to
us
by
30-foot
trucks.
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
was
a
two-week
trial
in
this
case,
wasn't
there,
before
judge
stewart?
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
get
to
a
more
current
issue,
could
iowa
ban
all
trucks
which
were
carrying
nuclear
waste
or
hazardous
waste
from
passing
through
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
a
safety.
it
would...
safety,
safety,
safety.
justice
rehnquist
well,
counsel,
following
up
on
justice
blackmun's
question,
iowa
is
somewhat
peculiarly
situated
with
respect
to
border
cities,
isn't
it,
in
that
being
bounded
by
the
mississippi
on
one
side
and
the
missouri
on
the
other,
you
have
dubuque,
clinton,
davenport,
keokuk,
fort
madison
on
the
mississippi
side?
council
bluffs.
justice
rehnquist
sioux
city
and
council
bluffs
on
the
other,
so
that
a
remarkable
percentage
of
the
population
lives
in
identifiable
border
cities.
justice
rehnquist
compared
to
wisconsin?
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
also
clear
that
if
you
ask
what
you
say
is
the
right
question
the
district
court
would
have
come
up
the
other
way?
because
the
district
court
said
he
was
convinced
that
the
freightways
had
shown
him
convincingly
but
not
overwhelmingly
that
there
was
no
relation.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lederer,
you
say
the
record
is
conclusive.
and
you
cite
in
your
brief
at
least
three
times
the
brotherhood
case,
which
says
that
the
district
court's
responsibility
for
making
"findings
of
fact
certainly
does
not
authorize
it
to
resolve
conflicts
in
the
evidence
against
the
legislature's
conclusion,
or
even
to
reject
the
legislative
judgment
on
the
basis
that
without
convincing
statistics
in
the
record
in
support
of
the
legislative
viewpoint
constitutes
nothing
more
than
what
the
district
court
in
this
case.
"
--that
is,
the
brotherhood
case...
"said
was
pure
speculation".
justice
rehnquist
but
judge
stewart
then,
in
effect,
found
against
you,
because
he
said
the
evidence
in
your
favor
was
convincing
but
not
overwhelming.
justice
rehnquist
but
there
were
witnesses
from
both
sides
and
he
had
to
pick
one
side
or
the
other
to
believe,
didn't
he?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
should
think
consolidated
would
have
its
own
bevy
of
witnesses
that
it
could
produce
on
these
occasions
too,
to
say
that
there's
no
effect
on
safety.
justice
rehnquist
does
it
try
the
statute
literally?
you
say
that's
to
determine
the
evidence.
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
brotherhood
case
say
that,
that
the
district
court
has
no
authority
to
resolve
evidentiary
conclusions
one
way
or
the
other
against
the
judgment
of
the
legislature?
justice
rehnquist
--what's
your
authority
for
saying
the
65-foot
trailer
is
the
national
standard?
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
talking
about
an
act
of
congress
or
of
any
governmental
body,
you're
simply
talking
about
the
practicality
of--
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
a
certain
domino
theory
to
your
argument?
if
you
can
persuade
minnesota
to
enact
a
law
allowing
a
100-foot
trailer,
then
you've
got
an
argument
that
iowa's
burdening
interstate
commerce
by
not
allowing
a
100-foot
trailer?
justice
rehnquist
your
argument
would
say
that
all
of
the
13
eastern
states,
or
however
many
they
be,
could
be
forced
to
accept
65-foot
twins
too
since
presumably
they're
as
safe
in
the
east
as
they
are
in
iowa.
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
you'd
really
have
a
stronger
case
than
the
raymond
in
wisconsin,
which
is
not
on
that
route.
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
maytag
washing
machines
in
newton,
iowa?
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
to
amend
the
law?
the
trucking
lobby
has
been
unsuccessful
in
getting
the
law
amended.
