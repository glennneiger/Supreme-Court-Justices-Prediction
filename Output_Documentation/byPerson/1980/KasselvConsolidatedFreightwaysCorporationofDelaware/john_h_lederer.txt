mr.
john
h.
lederer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--if
in
point
of
fact
drivers
falling
asleep
were
causing
accidents,
i
think
that
would
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
state
regulation.
i
am
in
agreement
with
my
brother
mr.
schantz,
if
a
state
regulation
promotes
safety,
if
in
fact
it
promotes
safety,
i
think
in
general,
absent
discrimination,
that
regulation
should
be
upheld.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
that
is
a
factual
determination
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
court.
and
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
at
this
court
we're
not
dealing
with
the
equal
protection
clause
and
we're
not
dealing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
due
process.
we're
dealing
with
the
commerce
clause.
and
i
think
the
test
under
the
commerce
clause
has
to
be
different
than
the
test
that's
applied
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
rational
relationship
test
is
an
inappropriate
test
under
the
commerce
clause.
and
the
reason
basically
is
because
under
the
commerce
clause
you
have
a
direct
conflict
between
the
state
government
and
the
interest
of
the
national
government.
in
that
situation
you
can't
turn
to
the
state
and
say
that
the
state
should
be
the
arbiter
of
that
conflict,
and
so
long
as
there
is
any
rational
relationship
whatsoever
we
will
defer
to
the
state.
in
this
case
i
think
the
thing
that
perhaps
is
most
important,
because,
as
i
say,
i'm
in
agreement
with
mr.
schantz,
if
the
iowa
regulation
promoted
safety,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
but
the
record
in
this
case
is
conclusive.
the
iowa
regulation
does
not--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i
think
you
have
to
draw
a
careful
line
between
two
things.
i
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
province
of
the
federal
courts
to
determine
that
if
there
is
a
slight
advance
in
safety,
the
economic
burden
outweighs
that
slight
advance.
the
decision
of
how
much
safety
is
a
political
decision,
and
that's
a
decision
that
has
to
be
reached
by
a
legislature,
be
it
state
or
federal.
what
this
court
can
determine...
not
this
court,
but
the
federal
court,
the
trial
court
can
determine
the
factual
case,
the
factual
question
of,
does
it
promote
safety
at
all?
that
is
a
factual
question
and
susceptible
of
proof.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
well,
no,
he
didn't
quite
say
"not
overwhelming".
he
said,
"the
evidence,
convincingly
if
not
overwhelmingly.
"
he
also,
in
other
places
in
the
opinion,
referred
to
it
as
"clear",
and
referred
to
it
as
conclusive.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
raymond
on
the
ground
that
in
raymond
the
state
defaulted
and
here
the
state
was
able,
not
to
default,
but
through
the
vigor
of
its
counsel,
to
find
some
expert
witnesses,
no
matter
how
questionable
their
expertise,
and
no
matter
how
contradicted
their
testimony
was
by
other
witnesses,
and
no
matter
how
restricted
their
testimony
was;
and
to
say
that's
the
difference
upon
which
a
commerce
clause
case
ought
to
be
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that's
right.
i
think...
you
know,
first
we
have
the
question,
of
course,
the
trial
court
has
to
determine
the
evidence.
i
think,
though,
that--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i
think
there's
a
distinction
that
has
to
be
made
here
between
two
types
of
statutes.
if
you
have
a
situation
such
as
we
have
in
iowa,
in
iowa
if
the
65-foot
twin
trailer
vehicle,
the
vehicle
itself,
is
unsafe,
then
iowa's
regulation
promotes
safety.
if
the
65-foot
twin
trailer
vehicle
is
safe,
then
the
effect
of
iowa's
regulation
is
to
cause
accidents,
injuries,
and
deaths
that
need
not
occur,
because
iowa
increases
the
hazard
to
the
interstate
traffic
by
forcing
it
to
go
around
the
state.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
or
having
more
vehicles
on
the
road
in
iowa
if,
rather
than
running
your
twin
trailers
around
the
state,
you
choose
to
run
semis
through
the
state.
in
that
situation
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trial
court
has
to
determine
what
the
evidence
is,
whether
the
regulation
does
promote
safety
or
does
not
promote
safety.
and
i
distinguish
that
case
from
a
second
case
in
which
you
have
a
regulation
by
the
state
which
might
promote
safety
but
if
it's
ineffective
causes
nothing
other
than
economic
burden.
in
that
case
i
think
perhaps
the
courts
would
be
fully
justified
in
giving
an
extremely
strong
presumption
of
validity
to
the
state
regulation.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
to
an
extent
the
brotherhood
case
does
say
that.
but
the
brotherhood
case
can
be
distinguished
on
the
basis
that
what
the
court
was
addressing
was
not
so
much
the
question
of
whether
the
train
crew
promoted
safety
or
didn't
promote
safety.
what
the
trial
court
did
that
it
should
not
have
done
was
determine
that
that
advance
in
safety,
no
matter
how
slight,
was
outweighed
by
the
economic
burden.
there's
a
suggestion
in
the
opinion
in
brotherhood,
and
more
specifically
in
the
trial
court's
opinion;
in
the
three-judge
panel's
opinion
you
find
a
strong
suggestion
that
in
brotherhood
the
trial
court
found
that
there
maybe
was
some
increase
in
safety,
it
just
wasn't
very
much.
and
given
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
very
much
and
the
burden
was
great,
it
ought
to
be
rejected.
we
don't
suggest
that
that's
the
proper
test.
what
we
suggest
is
on
the
record
in
this
case.
there
is
no
promotion
in
safety;
in
fact,
what's
happening
is
because
that
65-foot
twin-trailer
vehicle
is
safe,
what's
happening
is
that
unnecessary
accidents,
injuries,
and
fatalities
are
occurring.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
i
will--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i'm
embroidering
it
a
little
bit.
i
disagree
slightly
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
in
the
brief
we
did
make
the
argument
that
it
didn't
have
to
distinguish--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--not
in
its
full
form,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
the
difficulty
is,
are
we
looking
at
the
hypothesis
of
what
the
legislature
could
believe
or
are
we
looking
at
what
the
facts
are?
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
had
judge
stewart
on
the
evidence
in
this
case--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--held
the
other
way,
i
think
we
could
have
met
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
i
do
not--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--think
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
state
to
be
able
to
sustain
its
case
even
under
the
right
standard
for
appellate
review.
this
case
is
one-sided.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
reach
it
this
way.
returning
to
the
initial
question
of,
well,
suppose
the
legislature
had
a
rational
basis,
you
know,
what
the
legislature
could
believe
can
justify
many
things
in
a
commerce
clause
case.
i
don't
think
the
question
should
be,
what
could
the
legislature
believe.
in
fact,
the
evidence
in
this
case...
and
we
have
a
very
curious
record,
because
we
had
the
governor
as
a
witness
for
the
defense...
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
legislature
did
not
believe
that
the
65-foot
twin-trailer
vehicle
was
an
unsafe
vehicle.
the
legislature
in
iowa
passed
a
bill
that
would
permit
65-foot
twin-trailers.
that
bill
was
vetoed
by
the
governor.
the
governor
stated
in
his
veto
message
the
reasons
for
the
veto.
there
is
nowhere
in
that
message...
and
the
governor
stated
on
the
witness
stand
that
that
message
stated
all
of
the
significant
reasons
for
the
veto...
there
is
nowhere
in
that
veto
message,
the
suggestion
that
65-foot
twin
trailers
are
less
safe
than
55-foot
semis.
there
is--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i
believe
in
1963.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
no.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
it
became...
unconstitutional
and
i
shouldn't
so
quickly
say,
no...
sometime
around
1963.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
when
the
neighboring
states
went
to
65
feet,
far
more
pertinently,
when
65
feet
became
the
national
standard--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
given
the
fact
that
the
65-foot
twin-trailer
is
a
vehicle
as
safe
as
the
55-foot
semi--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--your
honor,
there
is
a
society
of
automotive
engineers
standard
for
interchange,
there's
extensive
testimony
in
this
case
that
no
other
vehicle
other
than
the
65-foot
twin-trailer
used
in
general
commodity
carriage
can
be
interchanged.
the
iowa
twin
trailer
study...
iowa
conducted
an
extensive
study
of
the
safety
of
these
65-foot
twin-trailers,
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they're
safe.
that
study
also
came
to
the
conclusion
that
only
the
65-foot
length
could
be
interchanged,
in
other
words
operated--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--practicalities,
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
when
it
arose
was
when
the
65-foot
twin-trailer
became
the
standard
vehicle.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
that
would
present
a
far
more
difficult
question
than
does
this
case.
i
think
it
would
be
a
serious
question
whether
iowa--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i'm
sorry.
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--that's
correct.
sixty
feet
may
well
have
a
relevance
to
safety,
but
what
iowa
has
shown
by
its
legislation
is
that
iowa
accepts
as
a
reasonable
standard
of
safety
the
55-foot
semi-trailer,
which
is,
you
know,
the
most
common
vehicle,
and
the
60-foot
twin,
which
is
a
highly
uncommon
vehicle.
we
have
shown
on
the
facts,
clearly,
conclusively,
that
the
65-foot
twin
is
as
safe
as
either
one
of
those
vehicles.
now
iowa
does
pick
up
a
very
significant
safety
advantage
by
prohibiting
the
65-foot
twin.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
the
problem
is
quite
simple.
the
iowa
legislature
has
acted
wisely
in
this
case.
sixty-five
foot
twins
are
are
as
safe
as
55-foot
semis.
nonetheless,
from
the
perspective
of
iowa,
the
iowa
legislature
has
acted
properly.
sixty-five
foot
twins
are
very
limited-purpose
vehicles.
they
are
used
for
large
general
commodity
carriage,
interstate
carriage.
iowa
is
not
a
large
manufacturing
state;
such
manufactories
as
it
does
have
are
located
generally
along
the
borders;
certainly
there
are
some
in
des
moines
and
other
cities,
but
the
borders
are
industrialized.
what
they
do
by
prohibiting
65-foot
twin-trailers
is
they
prohibit
interstate
through
traffic.
it
has
no
benefit
to
iowa.
it's
merely
passing
through
iowa
because
iowa
is
the
geographic
location
where
the
best
east-west
route
lies.
by
prohibiting
65-foot
twin
trailers
iowa
gets
rid
of
that
traffic.
it's
of
no
benefit
to
the
state
and
it
achieves
fewer
accidents
in
iowa,
because
it's
reduced
traffic
generally,
and
advantages
for
the
iowa
motorist
because
it's
reduced
traffic
generally...
that,
i
would
assert,
and
i
think,
you
know,
the
governor's
veto
message
certainly
suggests
it,
is
the
principal
reason
why
the
iowa
legislature
has
retained
their
60-foot
twin-trailer
limit,
particularly
since
the
border
city
exemption
removes
much
of
the
political
pressure
in
the
state
for
65-foot
twins.
the
result
is
that
iowa
is
shifting
to
other
states
and
to
interstate
commerce
in
general,
not
only
shifting
the
safety
burden,
but
also
increasing
it.
because
you
have
to
go
around
the
state
and
that's
a
longer
trip,
a
significantly
longer
trip.
the
result
is,
is
that
there
are
fewer
accidents
in
iowa
and
more
accidents
on
the
route
around
iowa
than
there
would
be
otherwise,
and
in
fact
far
more,
because
the
route
around
iowa
is
largely
two-lane
highway,
whereas
the
route
through
iowa
is
on
i-80,
which
is
an
interstate
highway.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
well,
it
would
not
so
long
as
you
accept
the
assumption...
and
it's
not
an
assumption
in
this
case,
it's
proved...
that
the
65-foot
twin-trailers
are
as
safe
as
55-foot
semis.
you
have
the
exact
same
problem.
iowa
suggests,
why
don't
we
run
55-foot
semis
through
the
state?
aside
from
the
problems
in
the
rest
of
the
system,
you'd
have
to
run
more
trucks
to
carry
the
same
amount
of
cargo,
and
if
you
run
more
trucks
through
that's
going
to
mean
more
accidents.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
don't...
early
in
the
process
i
think
you
could
argue,
yes,
it's
a
domino
problem.
but
we're
past
that
early
point
in
this
case.
sixty-five
foot
twin
trailers
are
a
widely
accepted
standard
everywhere
in
the
country
except
the
east
coast.
there's
a
map
in
the
appendix
that
lays
out
which
states
permit
them
and
which
don't.
those
states
that
don't
permit
them
are
all
east
coast
states,
generally
contiguous,
with
some
minor
exceptions.
iowa
sits
in
the
middle
of
a
region
and
is
the
only
state
that
prohibits
65-foot
twins,
and
because
of
its
geographic
location
astride
interstate
80
is
a
crucial
state.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
think
the
safety
question
would
be
the
same.
i
think
you'd
have
some
problems
with
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
the
burden
that
iowa
imposes
is
as
large
as
it
is
in
large
part
simply
because
of
iowa's
geographic
relationship.
it's
in
the
middle
of
routes
that
are
run
with
65-foot
twins
because
all
the
states
around
iowa
permit
65-foot
twins,
because
it's
on
the
major
transcontinental
east-west
route.
what's
passing
through
iowa
are
shipments
from
chicato
to
los
angeles,
from
the
industrial
midwest
out
to
the
west
coast
and
back.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that's
correct.
wisconsin
was
on
a
route,
but
certainly
in
terms
of
importance
i-80
is
probably
a
more
important
route
than
that
through
wisconsin.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
if
two
conditions
were
met,
one--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--nondiscriminatory.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
and
two,
that
there
truly
was
a
problem
on
the
roads.
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence
in
this
case--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
very
clearly
that
interstate
80
through
iowa
is
at
present
not
an
interstate
highway
that's
reaching
the
saturation
point
that
you
see
around
this
city,
for
example.
there's
a
level
of
service
study,
there
are
traffic
and
engineering
studies
which
show
that
there's
more
capacity
on
interstate
80
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
twin-trailer
traffic
on
that
highway
is
not
going
to
make
a
difference.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
we're
not
attacking
the
statute
as
it
prohibits
65-foot
twin-trailers
on
local
roads.
the
burden
in
this
case
comes
from
the
fact
that
what
iowa
is
doing
is
stopping
interstate
through
traffic,
that
through
traffic
goes
on
the
interstates.
the
voyages
would
be
entirely
on
the
interstates.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
we
simply
would
not
be
able
to
show
a
significant
interstate
burden.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
because--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--not
in
significant
volume
and
not
by
my
client,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
perhaps
some
understanding
of
the
way
the
general
commodity
system
functions...
normally,
pickup
and
delivery
of
goods
is
made
in
consolidated's
system
by
what's
called
the
short
semi
or
broken-down
double.
it's
half
of
a
twin-trailer,
short
semi
truck.
that's
legal--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--that's
correct.
however,
i
should
to
be
perhaps
fair
state
that
there's
simply
not
very
much
traffic
going
into
or
out
of
the
interior
of
iowa.
iowa
is
not
a
heavy
industrial
state.
most
of
the
goods
that
are
shipped
in
twin
trailers
are
manufactured
goods.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
the
district
court
made
a
curious
finding.
the
district
court
found
the
iowa
legislation
to
be
nondiscriminatory
because
it
promoted
what
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
state
goal
of
diverting
traffic
around
iowa.
the
district
court
then
went
on
to
say,
that
goal
has
at
least
the
aura
of
protectionism
to
it.
so
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
the
numerous
exemptions.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
the
facts
that
it
found
really
demonstrated
discrimination.
i
think
the...
i
don't
suggest
that
this
court
should
consider
the
governor's
veto
message,
or
even
the
legislative
history.
and
there's
perhaps
another
item
to
the
legislative
history,
is
after
the
governor
vetoed
the
65-foot
twin-trailer
bill,
the
legislature
then
passed
the
bill
for
the
border
city
exemptions,
and
the
governor
in
his
veto
message
said
specifically,
i
wouldn't
have
any
objection
for
goods
going
to
or
from
iowa.
i
just
want
to
get
rid
of
the
through
traffic.
but
the
legislature
then
passed
the
border
cities
exemption.
it
also
delegated
to
the
transportation
commission
the
power
to
permit
65-foot
twin
trailers.
the
transportation
commission
had
an
extensive
factual
study
that
was
prepared
by
the
iowa
department
of
transportation
and
it
was
intended
to
be
a
comprehensive
study
of
all
the
aspects
of
65-foot
twin-trailers.
that
study
found
that
there
weren't
any
safety
differences
to
the
disadvantage
of
65-foot
twin
trailers.
the
vehicles
were
safe.
the
transportation
commission
then
legalized
65-foot
twin
trailers
in
the
state
on
almost
all
the
primary
roads
in
the
state,
including
the
interstates.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
statute
that
only
affected
iowa
and
if
the
question
before
the
court
was,
did
the
iowa
legislature
act
wisely?
yes,
of
course.
under
due
process,
under
equal
protection,
the
iowa
legislature
could
do
such
a
thing.
but
we're
not
here
on
due
process
or
equal
protection.
what's
happening
here
is
the
iowa
legislature
is
making
a
determination
that
distinguishes
between
interstate
through
traffic
and
local
traffic,
but
it's
making
a
determination
that
benefits
iowa.
unquestionably
it
is
a
wise
decision
from
iowa's
point
of
view.
if
the
iowa
legislature
has
made
an
error
of
fact,
it
is
a
grossly
unwise
decision
from
the
national
point
of
view,
because
what
it
has
done
is
harm
the
safety
of
interstate
commerce
as
well
as
imposing
an
economic
burden.
in
that
situation
you
cannot
defer
to
the
iowa
legislature's
factual
judgment.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
if
all
it
did
was
increase
the
cost
and
it
reduced
the
number
of
accidents,
i
think
the
iowa
legislature
would
have
acted
properly
and
we
could
not
win
the
case
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court,
under
the
commerce
clause,
should
be
in
the
position
of
balancing
on
the
one
hand
increases
in
safety
and
on
the
other
hand
economic
burden.
perhaps
it's--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i
think
the
pike
case
is
relevant
in
that
it
establishes
the
overriding
general
test
to
be
applied.
we
have
here--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--i
think...
yes;
correct.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
corollary
when
you're
dealing
with
safety.
if
what's
being
promoted
at
the
local
level
is
safety
and
all
that's
being
harmed
at
the
national
level
is
economics,
if
it's
just
dollars,
i
don't
think
this
court
should
then
step
in
and
override
the
state
legislature.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
that's
a
political
decision.
that's
right.
and
it
should
be
made
by
a
legislature.
the
situation--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--no,
your
honor.
the
situation
here
is
not
that.
on
the
one
hand
we
have
clear,
convincing,
and
conclusive
proof
that
the
vehicle
is
safe.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
the
case
where
the
regulation
promotes
safety
at
least
directly,
in
other
words,
by
prohibiting
a
hazardous
vehicle.
the
vehicle
is
not
hazardous.
mr.
justice
marshall
earlier
referred
to
increased
splash
and
spray.
the
vehicle,
for
instance,
because
of
the
difference
in
its
running
gear,
puts
out
20
percent
less
splash
and
spray
than
semis.
the
vehicle
itself--
mr.
john
h.
lederer
--your
honor,
if
you
pass
a
twin-trailer,
it
will
be
less.
there's
quite
conclusive
proof
of
that,
so
we're
not
dealing
with
a
case
of
a
regulation
which
promotes
safety
directly.
there's
a
second
level
though
here.
if
that
vehicle
is
safe,
what
we're
dealing
with
in
terms
of
burden
is
an
economic
burden,
yes.
but
also
a
safety
burden.
iowa's
legislation
makes
it
more
hazardous
to
conduct
interstate
commerce.
regardless
of
what
consolidated
does,
whether
it
runs
its
goods
at
55-foot
semis,
60-foot
twins,
or
runs
them
around
the
state
in
65-foot
twins,
or
shuttles
them
through
the
state
in
broken-down
twins,
that
commerce
is
more
hazardous.
so
you
have
a
case
where
on
the
one
hand
you're
promoting
state's
safety
interest
solely
by
reducing
traffic,
because
the
vehicle
itself
is
safe.
and
on
the
other
hand
you're
increasing
the
hazard
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
i
could
express
it
differently.
iowa
has
prevented
the
industry
in
the
area
around
iowa
from
being
able
to
conduct
operations
as
safely
as
technological
advances
would
permit.
mr.
john
h.
lederer
for
a
very
clear
reason.
sixty-five
foot
twin-trailers
are
principally
interstate
through
trucks.
local
interests
don't
have
a
strong
interest
in
twin-trailers.
to
the
extent
that
they
do
the
border
city
exemption
substantially
lessens
that
political
pressure.
i
thank
the
court.
