justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
supposing
the
people
of
the
state
like
to
drive
slowly
and
they
have
a
20-mile-an-hour
speed
limit
for
everybody
in
the
state,
not
just
trucks,
and
they
enact
it
through
their
legislature
saying,
we
think
that
it's
pretty
clear
to
us
that
if
nobody
goes
faster
than
20
miles
an
hour,
we'd
have
fewer
deaths
on
the
highways.
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
stevens
well,
presumably
they
would
if
they
had
a
20-mile-an-hour
speed
limit
and
everybody
obeyed
it.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
understand
why
you
can't
make
the
same
argument
on
a
25-foot
truck
length
too.
they're
probably
safer
than
65-foot
trucks.
justice
stevens
well,
can't
the
state
just
adopt
a
25-foot
truck
length?
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
it
has
safety,
it
certainly
has
safety
concerns
associated
with
it.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
schantz,
before
you
get
to
congress,
could
the
state
ever
be
terribly
wrong
if
it
had
an
expert
who
was
willing
to
get
on
the
witness
stand
and
say,
i
think
there
is
a
probability
that
this
different
regulation
will
save
one
human
life?
i'd
certainly
be
willing
to
defend
that
proposition
and
i--
--regardless
of
the
cost
impact
on
commerce?
justice
stevens
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
the
wisconsin
case?
justice
stevens
mr.
schantz,
i'm
still
a
little
troubled
by
your
explanation
of
the
raymond
case.
you
say
that's
not
a
length
case
and
this
is
a
length
case.
well,
why
in
constitutional
terms
is
it
different
if
the
state
that
says,
well,
i
think
semis
should
be
regulated
in
one
way
and
twins
in
another?
why
isn't
this
the
same
kind
of
safety
judgment?
justice
stevens
but
you
would
think
they
could
reenact
the
same
statute,
just
put
a
little
different
legislative
history
in
and
then
they'd
be
okay?
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
why
they
can't
discriminate
between
twin-trailers
and
semis
if
they
should
happen
to
think
one
is
safer
than
the
other.
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
that's
subsequent
legislative
history.
when
was
the
60-foot
limitation
enacted?
justice
stevens
so
this
is
a
17-year-old
statute.
was
it
unconstitutional
when
it
was
enacted?
justice
stevens
when
did
it
become
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
when
the
neighboring
states
moved
to
65
feet,
that
made
the
iowa
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
stevens
well,
whatever...
iowa
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
step
into
line.
is
that
your
point?
justice
stevens
well,
but
mr.
lederer,
supposing
that
the
safety
evidence
all
showed
that
as
of
whatever
date
it
was,
everybody
was
satisfied
65
feet
was
just
as
safe
as
50
feet,
but
they
also
realized
50
feet
was
a
little
more
dangerous
than
40
feet.
could
they
have,
instead
of
going
up
to
65,
said,
we
think
we'll
be
very
safe
in
iowa
if
you
cut
everything
back
to
40
feet.
why
couldn't
they
have
done
that?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
they
had
a
constitutional
duty
to
lengthen,
to
increase
the
permissible
length,
even
though
the
60-foot
length
could
be
demonstrated
to
be
safer
than,
say,
a
35-foot
length
or
a
40-foot
length?
justice
stevens
isn't
there
a
difference
between
saying
that
the
difference
between
60
and
65
feet
is
zero,
but
that
doesn't
mean
60
feet
has
no
relevance
to
safety.
justice
stevens
mr.
lederer,
your
argument
based
on
the
governor's
veto
message
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
legislation
is
to
divert
traffic
around
iowa
would
support
the
argument
that
there
is
purposeful
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
in
effect?
justice
stevens
i
can't
remember,
did
the
district
court
make
any
findings
that
would
establish
that?
justice
stevens
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
facts
that
it
found
really
demonstrate
discrimination?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
your
increasing
hazard
argument
when
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1963
and
remained
unchanged.
it's
the
industry
that
changed.
the
law
didn't
change
in
iowa.
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
iowa
has
increased
the
hazard.
