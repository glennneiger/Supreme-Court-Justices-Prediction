justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
iowa's
statute
that
bans
certain
large
trucks
from
its
highways
violates
the
commerce
clause.
respondent,
consolidated
freightways,
is
a
large
common
carrier
about
truck.
the
type
of
truck
band
is
a
65-foot
unit
consisting
of
a
truck
--
tractor
pulling
two
trailers.
all
other
states
in
the
west
and
midwest
except
iowa,
allow
these
doubles
on
principled
highways.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
consolidated
that
the
iowa
statute
violates
the
commerce
clause.
in
opinions
filed
today
we
affirm
a
plurality
of
the
court
relying
on
our
1978
decision
in
raymond
motors
against
rice
agreed
with
the
court's
below
that
the
iowa
ban
is
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
our
past
decisions
reflect
a
high
degree
of
deference
to
state
laws
that
further
safety.
in
this
case
however
the
evidence
at
the
trial
and
the
district
court
so
found
that
doubles
are
as
safe
as
other
trucks
that
iowa
permits
to
use
its
highways.
absent
of
safety
justification
and
as
this
ban
plainly
disrupts
the
interstate
flow
of
commerce.
we
hold
that
the
statute
creates
an
impermissible
burden
on
such
commerce.
justice
brennan
had
an
opinion
joined
by
justice
marshall,
agrees
that
the
iowa
law
is
invalid.
they
conclude
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
that
separate
opinion
that
the
ban
on
this
type
of
truck
is
an
invalid
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stewart
have
joined.
