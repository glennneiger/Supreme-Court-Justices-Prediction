justice
white
do
you
really
want
to
add,
"at
what
cost"?
because
i
would
think
it's
consistent
with
your
argument
to
say,
as
long
as
they're
interested
in
safety,
and
that
they're
entitled
to
decide
how
much
safety,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
isn't
that
your
judgment?
justice
white
so
you
think
there
has
to
be
a
cost...
at
what
cost?
there
has
to
be
a
balance
in
it?
justice
white
you
mean,
in
short,
the
safety,
the
burdens
of
the
safety...
the
burdens
that
safety
imposes
could
be
too
much
burden?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
a
state
here
says,
instead
of
saying
all
nuclear
waste
trucks
stay
out,
all
trucks
over
60
feet
stay
out.
justice
white
that's
pretty
direct,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i'm
afraid
it
is,
that
there
are
no
trucks
of
that
length
allowed
in
the
state,
no
matter
what
they're
carrying.
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
trucks
can't
go.
justice
white
well,
are
other
kinds
of
trucks
permitted
to
exceed
this
length
limit
too?
justice
white
the
livestock
trucks
run
all
over
the
state.
justice
white
and
he
shouldn't
just
have
been
dubitante.
justice
white
suppose
you
read
the
opinion
below
as
saying,
well,
we
understand
what
the
right
standard
is.
we
should
ask
whether
a
reasonable
legislature
could
possibly
have
thought
this
was
related
to
safety,
namely,
limiting
to
60
feet
rather
than
65,
or
55
rather
than
65.
and
so,
applying
that
standard
we
find
that
there
is
no
relation
to
safety,
and
that
a
reasonable
legislature
was
just
away
off
base;
it
was
irrational.
it's
permitted
to
go
that
far,
i
suppose?
justice
white
is
the
court
permitted
to
go
that
far?
that's
the
proper
standard,
i
understand
from
you.
justice
white
no,
no,
no;
that
no
reasonable
legislature
could
believe
that
its
length
limit
is
any
safer
than
missouri's.
justice
white
any
difference.
suppose
the
court
concludes
that
just
no
reasonable
legislature
could
possibly
think
this.
they
just
got
blown
over
by
something.
justice
white
i
don't
blame
you
for
taking
that
tack,
but
here
the
court
did
say
that
iowa's
limit
as
compared
with
missouri's
has
no
relation
to
safety.
justice
white
well,
are
you
just
disagreeing
with
their
judgment?
are
you
saying
they
really
asked
the
wrong
question?
they
really
asked
the
wrong
question;
that's
your
point?
justice
white
so,
the
court
shouldn't
be
able
to
ask
if
five
feet
makes
any
difference?
justice
white
are
you
then
defending
squarely
the
court
of
appeals
decision
or
not?
justice
white
and
its
rationale?
justice
white
you're
embroidering
it
a
little
bit,
aren't
you?
justice
white
yes.
you
didn't
make
this
argument
that
you
just
made,
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
all
right.
then,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
suppose
the
district
court
had
resolved
the
case
the
other
way
on
the
facts
and
had
said
that,
gee,
we
have
a
range
of
experts
here,
we've
got
five
on
this
side
and
five
on
that
side.
and
suppose
it
decided
to
just
pick
the
other
side?
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
reversed?
justice
white
well,
then,
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
no
rational
legislature
could
have
decided
that
there
was
a
safety
factor
involved
here
if
the
district
court
on
the
evidence
before
it
could
have
come
out
the
other
way
and
withstood
an
appeal?
justice
white
well,
the
facts
are...
those
aren't
always...
that
depends
on
what
a
district
judge
finds,
that
here's
a...
you
just
can't
go
around
and
recognize
facts,
like...
they
don't
grow
on
trees.
here
are
these
witnesses
saying
what
the
facts
are,
and
there
are
five
on
one
side
and
five
on
another.
and
if
you
tell
me
that
the
district
judge
would
have
been
sustained
either
way
he
decided
on
that
evidence,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
the
legislature's
judgment
should
not
be
accepted.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
you
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
white
--of
course,
it
isn't
"clearly
erroneous".
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
that's
applicable
in
that
case.
taking
the
u.s.
gypsum
case
at
333
u.s.
which
i
think
lays
down
the
basic
clearly
erroneous
test,
it's
that
while
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
the
trial
court,
the
preponderance
is
heavily
against.
would
you
be
satisfied
to
settle
for
that?
justice
white
--you're
urging
that
a
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
arose
at
some
point?
justice
white
well,
suppose
iowa
just
said,
we
have
too
many
cars
and
trucks
on
our
roads
and
we're
just
going
to
ration
travel,
and
they
just
by
lot
reduced
the
number
of
trucks
on
their
roads
by
half,
in
order
to
promote
safety?
justice
white
nondiscriminatory;
yes.
justice
white
that
would
be
hard,
i
grant
you,
in
my
example.
justice
white
well,
there's
always
a
problem
on
the
road.
too
many
accidents.
justice
white
well,
aren't
you
attacking
the...
the
statute
surely
applies
to
trailers
on
local
roads?
justice
white
why
aren't
you
attacking
it
on...
insofar
as
it
applies
to
local
roads?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
aren't
there
any
goods
delivered
into
the
interior
of
iowa
of
goods
from
out
of
state?
justice
white
so
your
terminals
are
along
i-80?
justice
white
i
take
it
you
think...
what
relevance
to
this
case
do
you
think
the
pike
case
has?
any?
justice
white
and
a
nondiscriminatory
burden
should
serve
some
substantial
state
interest,
is
that
it?
justice
white
balance
safety
against
dollars?
so
you
just
don't...
you
don't
think
if
safety
is
on
the
one
hand
and
only
dollars
on
the
other,
pike
is
irrelevant?
