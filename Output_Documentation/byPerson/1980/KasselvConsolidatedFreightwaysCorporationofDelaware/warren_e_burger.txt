chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
kassel
v.
consolidated
freightways.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
elevate
the
lectern
if
you
wish.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
think
then
that...
let's
take
the
state
of
wyoming
or
colorado
or
some
of
the
states
with
mountains
and
curved
highways
and
steep,
could
have
a
shorter
length
than
even
iowa?
chief
justice
burger
let's
say,
just
five
feet,
not...
five
feet
shorter?
i
want
to
keep
it
within
reason.
chief
justice
burger
i
mean,
they
couldn't
say,
no
trailer
trucks
at
all,
could
they?
chief
justice
burger
what
would
you
say
about
iowa's
right
to
fix
a
50-miles-an-hour
speed
limit
when
nebraska
and
all
the
contiguous
states
were
60
miles
an
hour?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
they
dropped
it
down
to
20
miles
an
hour?
chief
justice
burger
that
would
be
an
undue
burden,
you
would
say,
on
interstate
commerce,
to
say
20
miles
an
hour
is
the
limit
for
trucks?
chief
justice
burger
that
has
echoes
of
the
recent
"benzene"
case,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
well,
what...
let's
hear
it
test
it
out
further.
suppose
they
said,
no
trucks
at
all.
suppose
the
amish
took
over
control
of
the
state,
populated
the
state
with
a
majority,
and
the
legislature
was
overwhelmingly
amish,
and
they
said,
no
trucks,
just
horses
and
buggies.
because
they're
safer.
they
can
demonstrate
on
the
record
that
if
you
just
have
horses
and
buggies
on
the
highways,
you
have
fewer
accidents
and
fewer
deaths.
is
there
a
point,
in
other
words,
when
there
is
an
undue
burden,
an
unreasonable
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
independent
of
whether
this
helped
or
hurt
the
local
merchants?
chief
justice
burger
perhaps
it's
irrelevant,
but
does
the
right
to
travel
possibly
enter
into
this
total
picture?
does
the
power
of
a
state
legislature
go
so
far
that
it
can
impose
limits
which
would
be
clearly
barriers
to
the
right
to
travel?
chief
justice
burger
while
we're
on
geography,
is
it
relevant
to
this
case
and
the
problems
of
the
case
that
iowa
is
something
of
a
crossroads
in
a
sense,
at
least
one
of
the
main
crossroads
for
east-west
traffic
and
north-south
traffic?
chief
justice
burger
iowa
is
pretty
big
to
detour
if
you're
going
from
minnesota
or
winnipeg
down
down
to
new
orleans,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
suggest,
perhaps,
it
just
relates
to
the
pain
that
they're
suffering,
not
to
the
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
burger
well,
are
you
then
saying
that
when
it
comes
down
to
slicing
it
that
thin,
the
phrase
you
used,
then
it's
for
a
legislative
body,
not
for
a
judicial
body?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lederer.
chief
justice
burger
let
me...
before
it
interrupts
your
line
of
argument...
ask
you
this:
suppose
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
it
developed
that
a
significant
number
of
accidents
on
the
road
by
over-the-road
trucks
of
whatever
size,
but
the
large
ones,
is
the
result
of
drivers
going
to
sleep
or
otherwise
having
some
problems.
and
therefore
the
state
would
require
that
any
truck
going
through
that
state
has
got
to
have
dual
controls
and
two
operators,
the
way
they
do
in
airplanes.
do
you
think
that's
carrying
it--
chief
justice
burger
--who
decides
whether
in
fact
it
promotes
safety,
the
courts
or
the
legislature?
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
the
state
says
that
13
percent
of
the
accidents
occurred
because
of
drivers
going
to
sleep
or
other
malfunctioning
of
the
driving
and
therefore
dual
controls
will
protect
that,
does
that
bring
it
under
the
mcgowan
v.
maryland
rational
basis,
or
not,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
burger
well,
is
it
a
difference
whether
that
kind
of
evidence
persuades
a
district
judge
or
persuades
a
state
legislature?
chief
justice
burger
someone
might
reasonably
argue
that
the
cure
for
that
is
for
the
other
states
to
copy
iowa.
chief
justice
burger
would
the
legislature
have
the
right
to
disbelieve
that,
or
regard
it
as
contrary
to
the
collective
experience
and
observation
of
all
of
the
legislators?
chief
justice
burger
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
they
reduced
the
speed
limit
from
55,
some
sort
of
a
national
limit
that
we
have,
to
45
or
50,
on
a
showing
that
this
would
reduce
the
number
of
accidents
but
it
obviously
would
increase
the
cost?
chief
justice
burger
haven't
you
come
pretty
close
to
describing
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
kassel,
the
director
of
transportation
against
the
consolidated
freightways
corporation
of
delaware
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
