mr.
mark
e.
schantz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
iowa
appeals
from
decisions
below,
holding
that
a
nondiscriminatory
iowa
statute
limiting
the
length
of
a
twin-trailer
vehicle
to
60
feet
unconstitutionally
burdens
interstate
commerce.
at
stake
here,
however,
appears
to
be
the
authority
of
the
states
to
regulate
vehicle
lengths
at
all.
the
iowa
legislature
has
determined
that
the
length
of
vehicles
should
be
limited
in
the
interest
of
safety.
implicit
in
that
determination
is
a
factual
premise.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
sole
interest
of
the
state
that
is
asserted
in
justification
of
the
statute.
the
premise
is
that
safety
concerns
increase,
safety
concerns
with
motor
vehicles
increase
as
their
length
increases.
and
the
central
issue
here
is
the
proper
scope
of
review
by
a
federal
district
court
of
such
a
factual
determination
by
a
legislature.
iowa
submits
the
district
court
misperceived
its
fact-finding
function
and
inappropriately
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
iowa
legislature.
rather
than
making
a
de
novo
determination
whether
iowa's
60-foot
limitation
promotes
safety,
the
federal
court
should
ask
only
whether,
on
this
record,
a
reasonable
legislature
could
believe
that
length
limitations
promote
highway
safety.
put
a
little
differently,
iowa
contends
the
court
should
not
have
asked,
as
it
plainly
did,
does
this
evidence
persuade
me
as
a
matter
of
adjudicative
fact
that
a
65-foot
twin
trailer
is
significantly
less
safe
than
a
60-foot
twin
trailer,
or
a
55-foot
semi?
rather,
the
court
should
have
asked,
could
a
reasonable
legislature
conclude
that
the
length
of
vehicles
operating
on
highways
should
be
limited
in
the
interest
of
safety?
if
so
could
a
legislature
then
conclude
that
it's
reasonable
to
draw
a
line
at
60
feet?
the
question
then
is,
what
is
the
question?
and
we
think
both
parties
agree
that
if
iowa's
limitation
is
properly
viewed
as
a
safety
measure,
iowa
should
prevail.
if
not
properly
viewed
as
a
safety
measure,
consolidated
freightways
should
prevail.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
we
think
it
does
make
a
difference
in
sunny
weather
too,
but
one
of
the
more
critical
differences
certainly
is
when
the
roads
are
bad,
and
they
are
frequently
bad
in
iowa.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
exactly.
that
is
one
of
the
principal
safety
concerns
here,
is
with
visibility,
is
with
splash
and
spray
that
large
trucks,
long
trucks,
regardless
of
their
configuration.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--i
think
they
could,
within
reason.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
no
twin-trailer
trucks
at
all?
i
don't
believe
so,
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
raymond
case,
which
our
interpretation
of,
is
a
case
that
involved
discrimination
against
vehicles
with
twin-trailers.
so
we
would
not
say
that
they
could
promote,
that
they
could
exclude
twin-trailer
vehicles.
indeed,
they
must
have
some
rational
basis
for
treating
them
in
any
way
different.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
we
would
strenuously
argue
that
iowa
has
that
authority.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
well,
with
all
line-drawing
problems,
as
justice
holmes,
the
quote
in
our
brief
from
louisville
gas
and
electric,
at
some
point
it
may
be
that
a
court
should
say
that
it's
not--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--i
would
not
characterize
it
that
way.
i
think
the
court
might
then
begin
to
wonder
whether
speed
was
the
basis...
that
a
concern
for
safety
based
on
speed
was
truly
the
basis
for
that
determination.
and
if
the
court
found
that,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
i
think
if
they
truly
did
it
consistently,
your
honor,
they
could--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--if
they
had
a
20-mile-an-hour
speed
limit--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--i
think
that's
probably
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
well,
i
would
be--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
we
would
defend
that.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
reveals
an
important
point
about
what's
going
on
in
this
kind
of
line-drawing.
it
is
really
a
question
of
how
much
safety
at
what
cost.
it
may
even
be
hard
to
identify
a
precise
increment
that
you
get
from
adjusting
a
line
five
feet.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
i
can't
address
myself
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
let
me
say
two
things.
first,
it's
not
critical
to
our
case
that
there
be
some
limit.
we
would
be
prepared
to
concede
that
for
argument.
i
think,
though,
it's
a
fully
defensible
position,
to
say
that
insofar
as
the
record
shows
that
the
state
is
truly
motivated
by
safety
and
that
that's
a
rational
concern,
that
this
court
need
not
intervene
under
undue
burdens
on
commerce
grounds.
for
one
thing,
if
because
the
decision
to
reject
that
is
a
legislative
type
decision,
how
much
safety
at
what
cost,
and
in
that--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--no,
to
be
clear,
i
think
any
safety
regulation
could
be
stricter,
or
a
state
could
invest
more
resources.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
yes,
i
do.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
it
is
just
because
it
is
a
policy
question
of
how
much
safety
at
what
cost,
that
we
believe
this
court
should
leave
that
question
to
a
legislature.
and
in
the
event
that
the
states
get
it
terribly
wrong,
if
iowa
were
to
get
it
terribly
wrong...
which
it
hasn't
in
this
case,
we
submit...
congress
is
there
to
substitute
its
judgment
on
that
question
of
policy.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that's
right.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
no,
we're
not,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
iowa
did
not
default
in
defense
of
its
length
regulation,
and
i
think
that
the
court's
questions
reflect
that.
this
court
is
persuaded
that
as
a
general
matter
length
is
related
to
safety.
and
we
think
the
record
supports
the
proposition
that
a
legislature
could
reasonably
find
that.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
yes,
and
a
very
long
period
of
depositions,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
well,
i
think
the
right
to
travel
cases,
primarily,
at
least,
involve
the
rights
of
persons
to
travel
and
not
the
right
of
carriers
to
transport--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--in
principle,
as
silly
as
it
sounds,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
that
is
not
a
bad
position.
congress
is
going
to
come
along
and
tell
us,
now
come
on,
iowa,
you've
got
to
get
into
the
twentieth
century,
if
we
tried
to
do
that.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
not
from
passing
through
it,
because
i
think
that
would
be
a
direct,
probably
would
be
a
direct
regulation
of
interstate
commerce,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
yes,
and
i
think
the
state
can
do
a
lot
of
things
that
are
reasonable
to
restrict.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
it's
not
a
barrier
in
that
sense,
in
that--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--but
the
nuclear
waste
would
not
get
through.
in
this
case
the
freight
can
go
through
iowa.
it's
not
a
barrier
in
that
sense.
and
in
fact,
many
general
commodity
carriers--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--that
particular
truck
can't
go
through,
and
if
the
limit
were
raised
to
100
feet,
your
honor,
that
would
still
mean
that
a
108-foot
truck
can't
go
through,
so
i
think
we're
still
basically
talking
about
a
question
of
line-drawing
by
the
legislature.
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
question
of
how
raymond
is
distinguishable
here.
the
evidence
is
one
very
critical
distinction,
i
think.
the
other
distinction
has
to
do
with
the
statutory
framework
of
wisconsin.
wisconsin's
legal
framework,
i
think,
differed
in
critical
respects
from
iowa.
one
looks
back
at
the
raymond
case
and
the
way
that
the
legislation
is
set
forth.
in
wisconsin
consolidated
freightways
could
not
operate
a
40-foot
twin,
or
a
55-foot
twin.
and
it
was
somewhat
irrelevant
that
the
twin
they
wanted
to
operate
was
65
feet
in
length
as
far
as
the
law
was
concerned.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
the
law
said,
there
was
a
general
statute
that
said,
that
was
referred
to,
that
semis
could
operate
at
55
feet
without
a
permit.
semis
beyond
that
length
could
not
operate.
that
was
the
length
limitation
for
the
semi-trailer
configuration.
now,
the
twins
were
advantaged
and
disadvantaged
in
comparison
with
that.
there
was
another
statute
that
said,
you
can
get
a
permit
from
their
dot
to
run
100-foot
trailer
trains.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
which
was
the
regulation
that
applied
to
twin
trailers
or
triples
or
how
many
ever
additional
you
added
on.
so
the
legislature
said,
if
you
get
a
permit
from
the
dot,
100
feet
is
okay.
the
dot
then
adopted
some
regulations
limiting
the
use
of
trailer
trains
to
garbage
trucks,
raw
milk,
and
empty
trailers...
empty
vehicles
in
transit,
i
believe.
and
so
it
was
really
because
of
their
configuration
that
wisconsin
did
not
allow
those
trucks.
now,
the
question
of
length
got
into
it
partly
because
of
the
way
the
lawsuit
was
defended,
but
it
wasn't
that
statute
which
was
challenged
by
consolidated
freightways.
all
of
their
evidence
was
comparative
safety,
between
the
twin-trailer
configuration
and
the
semi-trailer
configuration.
most
of
their
burden
claim
focused
on
the
cost
savings,
the
interlining,
the
cost
of
dock
handling
that
would
be
associated
with
the
configuration
of
the
vehicle
as
opposed
to
its
length.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
your
honor,
the
border
cities
exemption...
the
border
cities
provision...
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about
words,
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
an
exemption,
it's
a
classification
addressed
to
what
we
think
is
a
different
situation.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
we
think
that
is
another
difference
between
this
case
and
the
raymond
case.
iowa
does
have
a
series
of
length
provisions,
rather
than
one.
we
have
one
for
semis;
at
this
time
it
was
55
feet;
it's
now
been
increased
to
60.
for
twin
trailers,
it
was
60
feet;
for
buses
it
was
40
feet.
for
vehicle
carriers
it
was
65
feet;
for
livestock
carriers
it
was
for
60
feet.
and
for
vehicles
going
in
and
out
of
border
cities,
those
border
cities
which
passed
a
local
ordinance,
they
could
borrow
the
limit
of
the
adjacent
state.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
council
bluffs
on
the
missouri
side,
yes.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
i
don't
think
the
record
reflects
that
precisely,
your
honor,
but
that
would
by
no
means
be
a
majority
of
the
population
of
iowa.
several
of
the
larger
cities...
des
moines
is
three
times
larger
than
any
other
city,
and
it's
pretty
much
right
in
the
middle.
cedar
rapids;
waterloo.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
i
think
more
of
the
population
in
wisconsin
is
inland;
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
yes,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
twins
versus
semis.
you
can
run
larger
livestock
carriers
and
insofar
as
the
record
discloses
the
history
of
that,
it
is
basically
that
for
many
years
the
length
limitations
were
not
enforced.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
sixty-foot
livestock
trucks,
which
is
the
same
limitation
for
twin-trailers.
we
don't
give
the
livestock
trailers
any
special
break.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
from
consolidated
freightways'
point
of
view,
frankly,
i'm
sure
it
is
relevant,
just
as
pennsylvania
being
between
boston
and
new
york
on
interstate
highways.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that's
a
significant...
we
would
not
suggest
that's
an
insignificant
detour.
but
we
would
suggest--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--exactly,
your
honor.
because
we
don't
think
that
because
georgia
is
not
on
a
major
route
between
two
states
that
allow
longer
trucks
that
they
are
entitled
to
have
a
different
rule
than
iowa.
so
we
think
the
court
must
address,
really,
ultimately,
the
general
question
of
whether
the
states
are
going
to
be
free
to
adopt
reasonable
length
limitations.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
we
think
that...
well,
perhaps
that
didn't
completely
describe
our
argument.
we
think
that
the
insight
in
that
dubitante
opinion
is
very
much
what
we
are
arguing
for.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
we
think
it
would
have
justified
a
full
dissent,
your
honor.
because
i
think
when
we
separate
the
questions
of
whether
length
is
generally
related
to
safety,
which
was
really
the
kind
of
question
that
was
addressed
in
the
brotherhood
case...
and
i've
also
called
it
the
firemen
case,
and
i
apologize
for
that...
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
enginemen
and
firemen,
the
question
the
court
asked
there
was,
is
the
number
of
people
on
a
crew
generally
related
to
the
safety
of
the
operation
of
the
train?
and
i
think
it
was
clear
from
the
opinion
that
the
court
didn't
think
it
was
much
related,
but
they
thought
that,
it
could
reasonably
be
thought
that
it
was.
and
the
court
did
not
think
a
federal
court
should
decide
whether
you
had
four
crew
members
or
five.
and
a
similar
point
was
made
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
ray
v.
atlantic
richfield,
where
the
question
of
the
size
of
oil
tankers
came
up,
120,000
deadweight
ton
limit.
the
oil
companies
had
150,000
deadweight
ton
tankers
they
wanted
to
use.
the
court
didn't
really
address,
implied
that
this
is
for
the
legislature,
where
you
draw
the
line.
could
you
reasonably
think
that
the
size
of
tankers
is
related
to
safety
and
environmental
concerns?
in
the
opinion
justice
marshall
stated
the
evidence
was
in
conflict
and
therefore,
it's
a
safety
regulation,
and
when
you
get
into
that
safety
generally
prevails.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
i
think
if
consolidated
freightways
could
demonstrate
it.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
absolutely.
if
the
court
can
say
that
no
reasonable
legislature
could
believe
that
length
was
related
to
safety?
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that
five
feet
makes
a--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--well,
that
was
really
the
point
i
was
addressing,
your
honor.
i
think
to
ask
the
question
that
way,
which
is
really
the
way
the
court
asked
it,
i
think,
is
to
ask
the
wrong
question.
a
reasonable
legislature--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--the
trial
court
said
specifically,
little
if
any
difference,
five
feet
of
length.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
applied
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
which
we
think
is
wrong,
they
should
review
that
question
of
constitutional
fact
on
the
whole
record,
and
asked
whether
or
not...
let
me
start
over.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reasonable
legislature
could
believe
that
length
is
related
to
safety,
could
also
believe
that
five
feet
does
not
make
very
much
difference,
and
still
think,
we've
got
to
draw
the
line
here
somewhere.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
they
really
asked
the
wrong
question,
and
if
you
ask
the
right
question,
i
think
it's
clear
that
a
legislature
could
believe
length
is
related
to
safety.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
that
statement,
your
honor,
plus
the
fact
that
the
district
court
called
for
preemption
by
congress.
it
asked
congress
to
set
a
65-foot
limit.
the
only
rational
grounds,
i
think,
for
the
court
calling
for
that
is
the
court's
belief
that
on
that
record,
as
a
general
matter,
length
is
related
to
safety.
so
we
think
that
to
focus
on
five
feet
is
to
slice
the
salami
too
thin.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
not
five
feet
within
a
reasonable
general
range;
no,
your
honor.
maybe
i
wasn't
clear.
i
think
that
is
our
position,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what...
whether
night
turns
to
day
at
6
or
6:15,
to
use
justice
holmes'
example,
is
not
a
question
that
a
court
can
find
judicially
manageable
standards
to
answer.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
exactly.
because
it
is
that
kind
of
basic
choice
between
a
policy
choice
of
values,
cost,
and
safety,
that
is
hard
to
defend
at
an
intellectual
level.
and
the
court,
of
course,
i
think
must
find
standards
that
can
be
distinguished
and
developed
at
an
intellectual
level.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
it
is
the
same
kind
of
safety
judgment.
it
is
the
same
kind
of
question.
and
i
read
raymond
to
say
that
on
that
record,
on
that
record,
a
reasonable
legislature
could
not
believe
that
the
configuration
of
vehicles,
that
having
a
different
trailer,
two
trailers
rather
than
one,
makes
a
safety
difference.
the
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
had
wisconsin
tried
to
defend
that,
they
might
have
been
able
to
show
that.
but
they
didn't.
they
defaulted.
that's
the
relevancy.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
well,
no,
because...
not
the
same
statute.
they
can
reenact
a
length
limitation
that
is
applicable
to
twin-trailers
and
if
it
doesn't
discriminate
between
twin-trailers
and
semis,
i
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
well,
because...
perhaps
they
could
relitigate
that
point--
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
--it
has
to
be
a
rational
judgment.
and
this
the
court
has
said,
we're
going
to
let
the
carriers
try
and
prove
to
us
that
it's
totally
irrational.
and
what
i
think
raymond
means
is
that
in
that
case
they
did,
as
with
respect
to
the
variable
of
configuration
but
not
with
respect
to
length.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
leave
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
e.
schantz
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
