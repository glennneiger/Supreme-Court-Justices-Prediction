mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
facts
in
this
case
stretch
back
ten
years,
35
years,
those
facts,
and
the
issues
presented
in
the
case,
have
been
relevant
throughout
that
time,
are
important
today,
and
i
suggest
are
important
for
the
future.
over
150,000
people
were
naturalized
in
the
united
states
in
1980
and
in
the
decade
between
1970
and
1,500,000
people
were
naturalized.
the
question
as
to
fraud
in
procurement
of
citizenship
rights,
and
the
process
by
which
the
government
is
permitted
or
allowed
to
determine
that
fraud,
and
the
standard
under
which
misrepresentations
or
concealments
are
determined
to
be
material
are
relevant
and
important
to
the
underlying
facts
of
this
case,
of
course,
but
to
the
entire
operation
of
questions
dealing
with
entry,
resident
alienship
status,
and
denaturalization
as
well
as
deportation.
it
is
true,
as
justice
murphy
speaking
for
the
court
said,
today
perhaps
more
than
in
1943
when
he
stated
it
in
schneiderman,
that
"many
regard
citizenship
of
the
united
states
as
the
highest
hope
for
civilized
man.
"
and
for
that
reason
we
exercise
great
care
in
the
review,
the
application,
of
the
law
and
the
standards
by
which
we
are
to
deprive
someone
of
that
great
privilege.
i
wish
to
discuss
and
address
two
points
in
my
argument.
one,
the
meaning
of
materiality
as
applied
in
chaunt
and
derived
from
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
in
section
1451(a),
as
applied
to
either
a
willful
misrepresentation
or
concealment
of
a
material
fact,
the
grounds
in
this
case
on
denaturalization
was
ordered
by
the
5th
circuit.
and
the
second
point
i
wish
to
address
will
go
to
whether
or
not
the
government
in
the
district
court
by
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
proved
even
evidence
sufficient
to
meet
and
satisfactorily
meet
the
first
test
in
chaunt.
with
regard
to
the
first
point,
the
issue
as
i
see
it
before
the
court
is
whether
1451
and
materiality
applied
to
it
requires
the
government
to
prove
that
the
facts
if
known,
facts
which
were
concealed
or
misrepresented,
if
known,
warranted
denial
of
citizenship,
an
ultimate
fact
or
test;
or
whether
the
second
and
alternative
test
in
chaunt,
which
i
refer
to
as
the
investigative
or
investigation
test,
allows
the
government
to
prove
materiality
by
showing
that
if
the
facts,
if
known,
would
have
been
useful
in
an
investigation
which
might
discover
grounds
or
facts
warranting
denial
of
citizenship.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
think
that
the
court
stated
in
chaunt
the
second
investigative
test
in
two
separate
ways
which,
i
think,
have
the
same
meaning.
it
said,
early
in
the
opinion,
in
the
first
statement
of
the
test,
language
to
the
effect:
the
facts,
if
known,
which
would
be
useful
in
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
grounds
for
denial
of
citizenship.
in
the
second
part
of
the
test,
the
second
statement,
a
restatement,
i
think
it
dropped
the
"useful"
language
and
said:
facts
which,
if
known,
might
possibly
lead
to...
in
an
investigation...
lead
to
the
discovery
of
facts
warranting
denial
of
an
investigation.
i
think
both
statements
assume
or
presume
an
investigation,
a
concealment
of
facts
sufficient
that,
if
known,
they
would
trigger
an
investigation,
and
then
pose
the
scope
or
focus
of
the
investigation
to
be,
in
order
to
be
relevant
and
material,
to
the
eligibility,
the
possibility,
or
that
might
disclose
facts,
other
facts,
different
from
the
concealed
facts--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
brennan.
the
government
feels
that
the
thrust,
purpose,
and
intent
of
1451
is
to
prevent
fraud,
to
prevent
material
misrepresentations,
to
allow
the
government
to
rely
on
the
accuracy
and
truth
of
the
statements,
and
that
therefore
if
the
concealment
thwarts
an
investigation,
that
had
the
facts
revealed
it,
then
the
government
has
a
right
to
denaturalize
the
person
if
it
further
shows
that
within
the
focus
of
the
investigation
there
were
facts
which
might
have
warranted
denial
of
citizenship
or
eligibility.
and
that's
exactly--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--yes,
and
i
think--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--i
will
urge
in
my
second
point
that
the
district
court
erred
in
substituting
its
judgment
as
to
what
would
have
happened
back
in
1950
under
the
application
and
interpretation
of
the
law
then
and
practice
then,
as
testified
to
by
jenkins,
that
a
guard
at
an
extermination
camp
would
not
have
been
found
to
have
been
eligible
under
the
displaced
persons
act;
yes.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
substantially.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
do
not
think
that
they
rejected
the
test.
i
think
that
they
applied
the
test
in
finding
that
the
concealed
facts
of
arrest
in
chaunt
were
so
unrelated
to
the
possible
discovery
of
the
membership
in
the
communist
party
that
they
were
too
remote
and
too
tenuous,
even
if
there
had
been
an
investigation
and
been
discovered,
to
provide
any
probability
that
they
would
have
formed
a
basis
for
discovering
facts
which
would
have
warranted
denial
of
citizenship...
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
facts
closer
to
the
bone,
the
membership
in
the
communist
front
organization,
were
revealed
in
the
papers...
and
that
therefore
there
was
an
insufficient
proof
of
the
two
elements
necessary
in
the
second
investigative
test
in
chaunt.
one,
there
was
an
insufficient
proof
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation,
since
the
revelation
of
the
communist
front
organization
participation
did
not
trigger
an
investigation.
and
secondly,
had
there
been
an
investigation,
the
elements
of
the
facts
in
the
arrest
were
insufficient
to
have
been
within
the
scope
of
the
focus
of
the
investigation
to
lead
the
government
into
a
discovery
of
the
communist
membership.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
no.
i
think
probably
justice
clark
in
the
dissent
was
reading
the
chaunt
test
closely
or
narrowly
and
quarreling
with
it
by
restating
and
reciting
the
test
that
he
felt
was
rejected
by
the
second
investigative
test
stated
in
chaunt.
but
i
don't
think
that
in
the
discussion
by
justice
douglas
of
the
connection,
the
relationship
between
the
investigation...
the
concealed
facts
and
potential
ultimate
facts...
can
suggest
at
all
that
what
was
meant
by
the
second
investigative
test,
that
the
government
had
to
in
effect
prove
by
clear,
unequivocal,
convincing
evidence
other,
ultimate
facts
indicated
a
denial
of
citizenship.
because,
if
that
were
the
case,
there's
no
need
for
two
tests.
if
the
government
must
prove
that
there
were
existent
"facts"--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--oh,
i
don't
think
so.
if
the
government
actually
has
to
prove
ultimate
disqualifying
facts
in
its
case,
what
relationship
back
does
it
have
to
concealment?
it
has
none.
if
it
can
find
those
facts
or
develop
those
facts
under
the
test
advocated
by
the
petitioner
which
bears
little
relationship
to
concealment--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--i
think
so;
yes.
illegal
procurement.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
that's
correct.
deliberate
misrepresentation
with
regard
to
his
birthplace,
with
regard
to
the
place
of
his
education,
with
regard
to
his--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--on
the
grounds,
what,
your
honor?
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes,
your
honor,
he
was.
he
was
denaturalized
on
the
grounds
of
the
concealment
of
material
facts.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
it--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--yes.
stated
in
different
language
and
from
a
different...
advocating
a
different
standard.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
certainly
many
of
these
cases,
both
this
case
and
many
other
cases
in
the
field,
are
cases
brought
six,
eight,
ten,
15,
20
years
or
more
after
the
operative
facts,
particularly
if
the
concealment
and
misrepresentation
takes
place
and
is
not
only
perpetuated
in
the
naturalization
but
takes
place
at
the
time
of
entry
or
the
time
of
establishing
eligibility
under
displaced
persons
act
or
under
immigration
quotas
or
other
facts.
and
the
government
can't
be
denied,
it
seems
to
me,
and
the
petitioner
or
the
defrauder
permitted
the
opportunity
to
benefit
to
the
extent
he
would
benefit
under
the
petitioner's
point
of
view
for
10
or
20
or
30
years,
based
on
his
fraud,
and
then
be
in
no
less
position
than
he
would
have
been
in
had
he
not
committed
fraud,
since
the
government
still
has
this
very
onerous
burden
of
proof
and
proper
burden
of
proof,
and
the
petitioner
has
enjoyed
10
or
20
years
of
residence
and
some
of
citizenship
in
the
united
states,
and
in
the
process
has
shifted
the
burden
of
proving
eligibility
and
establishing
eligibility
to
the
government
because
the
government
bears
the
full
burden
in
a
denaturalization
case,
of
course,
to
prove
by
the
standard
of
proof
that
either
there
are
facts
which
it
establishes,
which
show
denial
of
citizenship,
or
a
material
misrepresentation
or
concealment
by
facts
which,
if
known,
would
have
triggered
an
investigation
which
might
have
or
possibly
have
shown
facts
warranting
a
denial
of
citizenship.
the
government
must
go
further
than
simply
say
that
there
might
be
facts
out
there
somewhere
from
which
a
denial
of
citizenship
could
be
gathered.
the
government
must
show--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--exactly.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
this
is
not
such
a
case.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes.
this
is
not
an
illegal
procurement
case.
it
is
a
fraud
case,
and
that's
what
we're
guarding
against
and
protecting
against
and
which
we
think
the
statutory
provisions
of
1451(a)
call
for
and
require
the
government
to
do.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes,
he
did
commit
a
crime
at
the
time
he
filled
out
and
made
his
statements
under
oath
in
1949
to
the
commissioner
of
displaced
persons.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i'm
certain
there
must
be.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
on
the
right
to
denaturalize;
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
no.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
let
me
move
to
the
second
point,
which
is
essentially
that
the
lower
court
found
facts
and
the
5th
circuit
affirmed
those
facts
without
articulating
it,
which
in
and
of
themselves
were
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
which
would
have
amounted
to
or
warranted
a
denial
of
citizenship.
and
that
essentially
is
the
argument,
that
the
guard
service...
armed
guard
service,
in
a
hat
and
shirt
and
jacket
with
epaulets
and
with
stripes,
with
a
black
tie,
with
boots,
with
a
pistol,
and
with
a
rifle...
was
of...
in
an
extermination
or
death
camp,
as
opposed
to
all
other
varieties
of
camps...
was
such
conduct
that
under
the
displaced
persons
act
definitions,
adopting
the
international
refugee
organization
definitions
in
appendix
1
of
its
constitution,
that
it
amounted
to
assistance
of
the
enemy
in
the
persecution
of
a
civilian
population.
jenkins'
testimony
was
uncontradicted
and
unequivocal
and
based
on
over
5,000
applications,
the
interviews
of
many
survivors,
the
exchange
of
information
among
other
like
vice
consuls...
and
there
were
some
30
or
40
of
them
operating
in
europe
at
the
time...
that
no
death
guard,
no
armed
death
guard
would
have
been
granted
eligibility
under
the
displaced
persons
act
by
a
vice
consul.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
on
117?
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
at
that
point--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--yes.
the
testimony
there
cited,
the
q
&
a
there
cited,
related
to
establishing
jenkins'
testimony
at
the
time,
establishing
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation
and
then
further
question
and
answer
was:
"and
what
if
the
investigation
had
shown
that
he
had
been
a
guard
at
an
extermination
camp
or
death
camp?
"
and
the
answer
then
was:
"displaced
person
eligibility
or
a
visa
would
have
been
denied.
"
the
lower
court
found
that
part
of,
expressly
found
that
that
part
of
jenkins'
testimony
with
regard
to
the
finding
that
if
he
had
been
a
guard
the
process
would
have
been
stopped
and
that
there
would
have
been
an
investigation...
was
credible,
gave
it
full
weight,
found
that
fact;
which
satisfies
test
2
of
chaunt
as
far
as
the
government's
proof
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
district
court
went
further,
though,
and
found...
and
this
is
where
i
think
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
alter
the
finding,
it
simply
found
it
unnecessary
to
determine.
the
district
court
found
that
as
a
matter
of
either
fact
or
misapplication
of
law
by
jenkins,
that
the
testimony
of
fedorenko
was
such
that
the
service
as
an
armed
guard
in
an
extermination
camp
was
so
involuntary
on
fedorenko's
part
that
it
would
not
have
disqualified
him
from
eligibility
as
a
displaced
person.
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
it
in
fact
interpreted
or
substituted
its
view
of
the
definition
of
voluntariness
and
the
definition
within,
assisting
the
persecution
of
civil
population,
at
the
trial;
and
with
fedorenko's
testimony
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
application
by
jenkins
of
the
displaced
persons
act
with
the
fact
and
the
conduct
and
all
the
relevant
evidence
and
knowledge
that
he
had
as
to
the
nature
of
the
armed
guard
participation
at
a
death
camp,
was...
his
conclusion
that
that
was
sufficient
alone
to
deny
a
visa
or
eligibility
as
a
displaced
person,
was
incorrect
and
not
credible
or
not
believable.
i
suggest
that
that
was
at
least
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
facts;
that
the
evidence
was
uncontroverted
on
the
point,
from
jenkins;
that
the
voluntary
testimony,
or
the
testimony
with
regard
to
involuntariness
by
fedorenko,
was
insufficient
to
establish
or
to
change
what
would
have
happened;
and
the
only
evidence
as
to
what
would
have
happened
with
regard,
and
properly
happened
with
regard
to
a
denial
of
a
visa
in
1949.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
oh,
sure.
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
it.
it
was
perpetuated
in
the
papers,
in
the
underlying
documents
in
the
representations
to
the
immigration
officer
who
did
the
interview
for
the
naturalization.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
initially--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--and
then
would
have
resulted
in
the
denial
of
his
naturalization
if
it
had
been
revealed
at
the
time
of
his
application
for
naturalization.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
depending
on
whether
or
not
the--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--it
depended
on
whether
or
not
that
continued
until
the
present
time
and
there
was
no
change
or
no
modification.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
the
government
feels
that
fraud
conducted
at
that
time,
which
ties
and
relates
to
the
ground
for
his
lawfully
being
in
the
united
states
for
five
years...
which
is
a
condition
for
naturalization,
we
can
reach
back
and
denaturalize
him
for
that
fraud
and
that
that
is
the
scheme
and
structure
of
the
statute
in
12...
1451.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
think
it
would
relate
if
you
are
unlawfully
here
because
your
visa
is
unlawful,
that
is--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
--a
precondition
to,
and
one
of
the
criteria
for
naturalization.
and
therefore
it
relates
to
naturalization
and
it
would
produce
a
failure
warranting
a
denial
of
naturalization.
so
it's
not
totally
unrelated.
now,
that's
not
this
case,
because
there
was
a
perpetuation
of
the
concealment
and
of
the
misrepresentation
directly
and
specifically
throughout
not
only
the
visa
circumstances
in
1949
and
1950
but
then
on
into
and
through
1969
and
1970.
mr.

thank
you,
your
honors.
