justice
stevens
mr.
gildea,
just
so
i
can
follow
this
correctly,
are
you
telling
us
what
the
district
court
found
or
what
your
client
testified
to?
are
these
undisputed
facts?
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
some
controversy
about
the
facts.
justice
stevens
--mr.
gildea,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
what
your
interpretation
of
chaunt
is.
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
it
is
that
there
might
have...
had
the
fact
been
disclosed
there
might
have
been
an
investigation,
but
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
had
the
investigation
been
thorough
and
successful
and
all
the
rest,
there
were
facts
in
existence
which
would
have
warranted
the
denial
of
citizenship,
so
the
"might"
goes
to
whether
there
would
have
been
any...
there
are
two
doubtful
facts...
one,
there
may
or
may
not
have
been
an
investigation;
two
they
may
or
may
not
have
discovered
the
facts.
but
you
say,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
had
everything
been
done
properly
there
were
facts
to
be
discovered,
which
would
have
warranted
the
denial
of
citizenship.
they
had
to
prove
that.
justice
stevens
and
the
reason
that
the
proof
failed
in
chaunt
was
that
when
you
get
to
the
whole
bottom
of
the
story
the
government
failed
to
establish
any
fact
which...
he
failed
to
establish
membership
in
the
communist
party,
which
would
have
been
a
fact
warranting
denial
of
citizenship.
justice
stevens
and
that
those
activities
would
have
justified
a
denial
of
citizenship.
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
as
i
listen
to
your
statement
of
the
test
for
which
the
government
contends
on
the
second
half
of
chaunt,
i
think
it
is
this...
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
the
test
is
whether
the
falsification
by
misleading
the
examining
officer
forestalled
an
investigation
which
might
have
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
petitioner's
application
for
naturalization.
justice
stevens
that
is
the
test
for
which
justice
clark
in
dissent
in
chaunt
contended
should
apply.
and
it
was
his
view
that
the
majority
squarely
rejected
that
test.
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
justice
clark
in
dissent
and
the
majority
in
chaunt
were
applying
the
same
test?
justice
stevens
there'd
still
be
a
difference
because
the
first
test
is
very
simple:
if
the
concealed
fact
itself
would
result
in
denial,
that's
it.
the
second
test
would
be,
there
are
somewhere
in
the
background
facts
not
specifically
called
for
by
the
application
but
which
might
have
been
discovered,
and
would
have
warranted
a
denial,
but
there's
doubt
as
to
whether
they
would
have
been
discovered.
and
then
the
test
would
be
whether
the
concealed
fact
would
have
triggered
investigation
which
might
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
disqualifying
circumstance;
that's
a
different
test.
now,
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
it
but
at
least
it's
a
different
test
than
the
first
test.
justice
stevens
is
there
a
statutory
authority
for
denaturalizing
a
person
on
the
ground
that
even
though
his
application
was
completely
true,
there
was
at
the
time
of
the
application
a
fact
in
existence
which
if
known
would
have
disqualified
him?
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
one
other
minor
question.
under
your
view
of
the
facts,
did
the
applicant
commit
a
crime
at
the
time
he
filled
out
his
application?
is
this
a
criminal
penalty?
is
this
a
criminal
offense?
justice
stevens
and
is
there
a
statute
of
limitations
on
that
offense,
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
stevens
but
there's
no
statute
of
limitations
on
the
right
to
denaturalize?
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
the
first
theory.
in
the
chaunt
case
we
were
concerned
with
misrepresentation
in
an
application
for
naturalization,
and
the
question
whether
it
was
a
fact
in
existence
would
have
resulted
in
denial
of
citizenship.
here,
as
i
understand
it,
we're
concerned
with
a
misrepresentation
in
an
application
for
a
visa.
there
is
no
claim
of
misrepresentation
in
the
application
for
naturalization,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
but
let
me
just
finish
my
point.
the
point
is
that
the
concealed
fact,
assuming...
is
one
which
would
have
resulted
in
a
denial
of
his
visa?
justice
stevens
and
isn't
it
true
that
any--
justice
stevens
it
was
a
material
fact
because
it
would
have
prevented
his
getting
the
visa.
justice
stevens
but
it
was
never
revealed.
the
same
thing
continued.
justice
stevens
so
the
test
in
the
denaturalization
proceeding
is
whether
the
concealed
fact
in
the
application
for
visa
would
have
resulted
in
the
denial
of
the
visa.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
fact
which
would
result
in
the
denial
of
citizenship
in
and
of
itself.
justice
stevens
right;
you
didn't
admit
you
were
married--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
assume
that
in
my
case.
the
man
never
has
admitted
that
he
was
married
or
whatever
it
was.
