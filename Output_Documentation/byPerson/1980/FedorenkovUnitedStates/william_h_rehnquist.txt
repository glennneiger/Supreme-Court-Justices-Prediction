well,
didn't
the
5th
circuit
hold,
though,
that,
"we
have
held
that
the
defendant
obtained
his
citizenship
by
misrepresentation,
concealment
of
his
whereabouts
during
the
war
years,
and
his
service
as
a

guard?

justice

when
you're
talking
about
something
that
would
have
triggered
an
investigation
30
years
ago
or
40
years
ago
or
20
years
ago
and
say
that
the
standard
is
that
the
government
must
prove
that
the
investigation
would
have
resulted
in
the
denial
of
naturalization,
you're
really
going
way
back
into
the
cases
of
missing
witnesses
and
difficult
information
to
come
by,
aren't
you?

rehnquist
general
civiletti,
when
you
say
the
facts
would
have
been
useful,
is
that
the
equivalent
of
meaning
that
they
would
have
triggered
an
investigation?
justice
rehnquist
general
civiletti,
i
refer
you
to
page
117
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
part
of
the
5th
circuit's
opinion,
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
tell
whether
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
5th
circuit
found
the
district
court's
findings
were
clearly
erroneous
or
whether
they
simply
took
part
of
them
and
rejected
another
part
of
them;
particularly
if
you
look
at
that
footnote
there.
