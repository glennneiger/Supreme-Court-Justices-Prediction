mr.
brian
m.
gildea
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
of
feodor
fedorenko
v.
united
states,
which
is
now
before
this
court,
is
an
appeal
from
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida
in
a
denaturalization
proceeding
on
grounds
that
the
district
court
erred
in
its
interpretation
of
8
united
states
code
1451(a),
and
because
that
court
also
erred
in
finding
an
equitable
alternative
basis
for
its
holding
in
that
lower
court
decision.
although
three
challenges
were
raised
by
the
government
in
its
appeal
before
the
5th
circuit,
the
5th
circuit
decision
was
limited
to
whether
or
not
the
court
erred
in
its
interpretation
and
application
of
the
second
standard
in
chaunt,
which
comes
out
of
8
united
states
code
1451(a),
and
whether
that
court
had
no
basis
for
an
equitable
holding,
which
it
did
find.
precedent
for
this
case
arises
out
of
the
1969
supreme
court
decision
of
chaunt
v.
united
states.
in
that
case
the
supreme
court
was
asked
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
materiality
standard
as
imposed
by
the
statute.
the
district
court,
in
following
the
precedent,
and
the
supreme
court's
determination
of
what
was
a
materiality
question,
held
that
the
government
in
the
lower
court
failed
to
prove
by
clear,
unequivocal,
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
petitioner's
visa
was
illegally
procured
by
material
misrepresentation
under
8
u.s.c.
1451(a).
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
lower
court
as
to
its
meaning
of
chaunt,
and
held
that
the
government
did
in
fact
meet
its
burden
of
proof
under
the
second
materiality
standard
set
forth
in
chaunt.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
court
in
its
finding
in
holding
that
the
government
had
not
met
its
burden
in
the
first
materiality
standard
test.
the
court
of
appeals
also
disagreed
with
the
district
court
in
that
there
was
no
precedent
for
the
district
court
to
hold
that
it
could
consider
equitable
grounds
as
an
alternative
holding
in
its
case.
the
court
of
appeals
then
reversed
and
remanded
the
appeal
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
your
honor,
if
his
citizenship
is
taken
away,
he
would
be
subject
to
further
proceedings
under
the
deportation
section
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act,
which
would
require
further
proceedings.
he
just
simply
loses
his
citizenship
at
this
juncture,
if
the
supreme
court
so
holds
that
the
appellate
court
was
correct.
by
way
of
background,
the
petitioner
in
this
action,
mr.
feodor
fedorenko,
was
born
in
1907
in
sivasch,
ukraine,
subject
of
the
ussr,
and
received
a
third
grade
education.
in
1941
he
was
mobilized
into
the
russian
army
along
with
his
truck
and
while
serving
in
the
russian
army,
his
group
was
overrun
by
the
german
forces--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
--and
taken
prisoner
by
the
germans.
subsequently
he
was
transported
to
five
different
camps,
which
are
cited
in
the
brief.
and
in
those
camps
he
was
starved,
he
was
beaten,
and
he
was
forced
to
work
or
die.
he
was
then
trained
at
travnicki
to
serve
as
a
guard
and
was
given
a
uniform,
boots,
and
trained
to
operate
and
handle
a
weapon.
that
was
a
rifle.
he
was
then
sent
to
the
treblinka
camp,
where
he
served
involuntarily
as
a
guard
for
10
months.
after
the
uprising
in
treblinka
in
august,
1943,
he
was
assigned
back
to
travnicki,
then
to
poelitz,
and
then
to
hamburg,
all
while
under
the
control
of
the
german
army.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
these
are
facts
that
i'm
stating
to
the
court
are
not
only
the
testimony
of
my
client
but
the
finding
of
the
lower
court
that
he
did
in
fact
serve
involuntarily
and
that
he
did,
in
fact,
go
to
these
various
camps.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
your
honor,
it's
only
relevant
in
the
sense--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
reason
why
i
bring
this
fact
out
to
your
honors
is
that
in
his
xx
he
was
transferred
not
only
to
treblinka
but
also
to
poelitz,
which
was
a
labor
camp.
that
fact
was
ultimately
revealed
to
the
immigration
authorities,
although
treblinka
was
concealed.
and
that
becomes
an
important
issue
in
this
case,
as
i
will
get
to.
when
the
war
ended
the
petitioner
worked
for
the
british
forces
until
1949
and
thereafter
applied
for
immigration
into
the
united
states
through
the
vice
consular
office
in
germany,
was
accepted,
and
came
to
the
united
states
in
1949.
from
that
point
on
he
resided
in
waterbury,
connecticut,
up
until
the
time
of
his
retirement
from
his
place
of
employment
and
in
1970
he
received
his
naturalization
after
his
application
filed
in
1969,
and
in
1977
the
government
commenced
these
proceedings
against
mr.
fedorenko,
seeking
to
strip
him
of
his
naturalization,
claiming
that
he
had
made
a
material
misrepresentation
in
procuring
his
visa
to
the
united
states,
that
he
had
committed
atrocities
at
the
treblinka
death
camp,
and
that
he
had
been
in
service
in
the
german
army.
after
a
trial
which
was
conducted
in
part
in
waterbury,
connecticut,
and
then
in
fort
lauderdale,
florida,
the
district
court
in
a
54-page
decision
rendered
judgment
for
the
petitioner.
the
district
court
rejected
the
testimony
of
treblinka
survivors,
who
testified
at
that
trial
regarding
mr.
fedorenko
and
his
activities
at
the
treblinka
death
camp.
mr.
fedorenko,
in
marked
contrast
to
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
who
came
over
from
israel,
denied
all
of
the
allegations
and
denied
all
of
the
testimony
against
him
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
he
was
indeed
a
guard
in
death
camp
no.
1,
but
only
a
perimeter
guard
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
operation
of
the
gas
chambers.
the
court
also
found,
in
its
54-page
decision,
that
the
petitioner
served
involuntarily
as
a
guard
under
a
threat
of
death,
and
that
his
misrepresentations
were
not
material
under
either
of
the
tests
in
chaunt
v.
united
states.
the
district
court
also
found
an
alternative
holding
for
its
decision
on
equitable
grounds.
the
government
appealed,
claiming
the
district
court
erred
in
rejecting
testimony
of
witnesses,
and
in
applying
the
materiality
standard,
and
in
using
equitable
considerations
as
an
alternative
holding.
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
on
the
district
court's
rejection
of
the
testimony
of
the
treblinka
witnesses.
it
simply
ruled
only
on
the
grounds
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
had
met
its
burden
of
proof
as
to
the
second
materiality
standard
and
whether
the
district
court
had
authority
to
enter
an
alternative
holding
on
equitable
grounds.
it
was,
indeed,
critical
to
the
government's
appeal
before
the
5th
circuit
to
convince
that
court
that
the
testimony
of
one
kempton
jenkins
established
the
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
standard
required
by
chaunt.
the
testimony
of
mr.
jenkins
was
the
only
testimony
offered
by
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
satisfy
that
standard.
the
district
court
rejected
a
substantial
portion
of
mr.
jenkins'
testimony
because
it
was
circumstantial,
inaccurate,
and
not
clear,
unequivocal,
and
convincing
to
prove
a
material
misrepresentation
under
either
of
the
chaunt
standards.
as
in
chaunt,
the
government
here
was
given
one
fact
and
that
was
the
petitioner's
presence
at
poelitz,
which
was
a
known
labor
camp.
and
that
fact
should
have,
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
jenkins,
triggered
an
investigation
into
mr.
fedorenko's
background.
either
it
did
not
or
the
investigation
which
was
conducted
did
not
disqualify
the
petitioner.
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
what
specifically
happened
with
mr.
fedorenko
at
the
time
that
he
filed
his
petition
for
visa
to
the
united
states
in
1949,
because
the
government
did
not
produce
as
an
essential
witness
in
this
case
mr.
ralph
g.
clark,
the
vice
consul
who
processed
his
visa.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
i
believe
it
would.
if
i
may
direct
a
comment
to
your
question,
justice
brennan,
in
reference
to
that
it
should
be
noted
that
mr.
jenkins'
testimony
with
reference
to
voluntariness,
that
is,
whether
or
not
mr.
fedorenko's
service
was
voluntary,
was
based
upon
his
opinion
from
hearsay
evidence
or
conversation
that
he
had
with
other
vice
consuls,
and
because
of
only
a
very
limited
contact
with
three
other
guards,
whether
they
were
personal
contacts
or
contacts
with
the
other
consuls,
i'm
not
sure.
but
he
did
not
at
any
time
ever
interview
or
refuse
admittance
by
way
of
visa
for
any
guard
who
served
at
the
treblinka
camp.
furthermore,
the
district
court
rejected
his
interpretation
of
voluntary
because
to
accept
his
opinion
of
voluntary
status
would
mean
that
those
survivors
of
treblinka
who
have
found
their
way
to
the
united
states
would
have
been
rejected
by
his
standard,
because
they
in
some
way
served
at
the
treblinka
death
camp
and
processed
other
jews
and
christians
to
their
death.
now
if
one
accepts
the
fact
that
the
kapos
that
were
at
the
treblinka
camp
and
that
the
laborers
who
were
forced
to
perform
mechanical
tasks
in
processing
these
people
into
the
gas
chambers,
according
to
jenkins'
standards,
committed
voluntary
acts
or
acquiesced
in
the
german
efforts
to
annihilate
people
because
of
their
religion,
that
is,
the
jews;
to
annihilate
people
because
of
their
inferior
background,
that
is,
the
ukrainians,
the
poles,
the
eastern
europeans;
then
they
would
not
be
admitted
to
the
united
states.
their
service
would
have
been
considered
voluntary
and
not
involuntary.
and
the
district
court
felt
that
involuntary
was
a
very
crucial
key
to
this
case,
and
ruled,
after
listening
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
jenkins
and
after
listening
to
the
testimony
of
all
the
survivors
of
treblinka,
and
mr.
fedorenko,
that
his
definition
of
voluntary
should
be
rejected.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry;
i
didn't--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
not
the
district
court.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
issue--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that's
correct.
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
concealment
of
his
whereabouts
during
world
war
ii,
that
is,
his
presence
at
the
treblinka
concentration
camp,
was
a
fact
that
would
have
denied
him
admission
under
either
the
first
or
the
second
test.
now,
the
government
claims
that
the
nondisclosed
fact,
that
is,
treblinka
or
his
presence
at
treblinka
as
a
guard
would
have
triggered
an
investigation
resulting
in
the
denial
of
his
visa.
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
chaunt
case
in
some
minor
respects.
and
one
of
the
respects
i
wish
to
point
out
is
this.
in
the
chaunt
case
the
supreme
court
had
ruled
that
the
nondisclosed
membership
of
mr.
chaunt
in
the
communist
party
was
a
fact
in
and
of
itself
that
should
have
denied
citizenship,
whereas
this
petitioner's
nondisclosed
guard
duty
at
treblinka
was
found
by
the
district
court
as
nondisqualifying,
that
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
would
not
have
denied
him
admission
to
the
united
states.
in
chaunt
the
supreme
court
also
considered
additional
facts
to
see
whether
the
second
test
had
been
satisfied.
in
chaunt
the
supreme
court
considered
whether
the
nondisclosure
of
an
arrest
record
was
a
material
misrepresentation
under
the
second
test
of
chaunt.
it
ruled,
no,
because
the
ultimate
facts,
that
is,
the
cause
for
the
basis
for
arrest,
although
involving
convictions
of
minor
crimes,
was
of
an
extremely
slight
consequence.
the
district
court
also
looked
into
the
background
of
mr.
fedorenko,
the
petitioner,
in
this
matter,
and
in
the
evidence
that
was
offered
by
the
government,
evidence
to
establish
those
ultimate
facts...
that
is,
his
presence
at
treblinka,
the
voluntariness
of
his
services,
and
the
commission
of
atrocities,
were
ultimate
facts
that
the
court
ruled
upon...
worked
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
not
committed
atrocities,
had
not
served
voluntarily,
and
that
these
facts
would
not
have
denied
him
a
visa,
and
therefore
no
material
misrepresentation
had
been
committed.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
dropped
from
its
decision
the
essential
term
that
had
been
contained
in
the
supreme
court's
decision
of
chaunt,
and
that
was
the
term,
"unequivocal".
the
supreme
court
had
held
in
chaunt
that
the
government
must
prove
by
clear,
unequivocal,
and
convincing
evidence,
that
there
was
a
material
misrepresentation.
the
district
court
used
the
full
meaning
of
chaunt
in
its
application
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
whereas
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
slightly
modified
the
meaning
of
chaunt,
not
only
by
dropping
that
term
from
the
standard
that
the
government
must
establish
in
its
proof,
but
also
modified
some
of
the
words
in
the
chaunt
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
interpretation
of
chaunt
said
that
"the
test
of
chaunt,
including,
had
the
petitioner
disclosed
his
presence
at
treblinka,
would
have
conducted
an
inquiry
that
might
have
resulted
in
a
denial
of
a
visa.
"
the
supreme
court
in
the
last
few
words
of
its
second
standard
in
chaunt
did
not
use
the
term
"might",
but
used
the
term
"would".
thus
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
really
disagreed
with
the
district
court
by
saying,
the
government
need
only
prove
or
establish
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
investigation
and
that
possibility--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that
is,
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
government
"would
have
conducted
an
inquiry
that
might
have
resulted
in
a
denial
of
a
visa.
"
so,
in
other
words,
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
creates
a
burden
of
saying
that
fact,
nondisclosure,
absolutely
would
have
caused
an
investigation.
instead
of
saying
the
term
"might"
or
"possibly",
it
said
it
would
have.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
the
first
half
of
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that's
correct,
but
the
second
half
isn't.
that
is,
where
it
says,
it
"might
have
resulted
in
a
denial
of
a
visa.
"
whereas
the
supreme
court--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--all
right.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
but
the
last
few
words
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
says
that
it
"would
have
justified
denial
of
citizenship
or
that
the
facts
would
have
warranted
denial
of
citizenship.
"
those
are--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that
is
from
chaunt,
your
honor,
the
second
standard
in
chaunt.
the
supreme
court
commented
on--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
are
you
reading
from
the
first
section
of
chaunt
or
from
the
conclusions
of
chaunt?
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
all
right.
earlier
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
it
also
talked
in
terms
of
the
two
standards
of
chaunt
and
it
used
this
word...
that
would
be
the
third
page
of
its
opinion...
and
it
said,
"true
facts
might
have
led
to
the
disclosure
of
other
facts
which
would
justify
denial
of
citizenship.
"
and
then
in
its--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that
apparently
has
resulted
in
the
choice
of
words
in
that
decision
and
because
there
did
seem
to
be
a
change
in
the
opinion
as
you
go
along,
that
caused
some
of
the
confusion
that
exists
between
the
district
court's
interpretation
and
the
interpretation
given
by
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that's
correct.
that
was
their
burden,
they
would
have
to
prove
that.
and
because,
as
in
chaunt,
what
was
the
reason
or
the
purpose
for
the
supreme
court
to
look
into
mr.
chaunt's
background?
why
did
the
supreme
court
examine
his
arrest
record?
to
determine
that
those
ultimate
facts
would
not
have
denied
him
his
citizenship.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that
would
have
satisfied
the
first
test
but
as
to
the
second
test,
the
government
failed
to
prove
that
the
ultimate
fact,
that
is
the
basis,
the
reason
for
his
arrests
would
have
led
the
government
to
information
about
his
activities
and
involvement
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
absolutely.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
i
feel
that
the
district
court's
opinion,
its
interpretation
of
chaunt,
and
the
argument
that
i'm
trying
to
make
before
this
court,
is
a
middle
road
argument.
i
don't
feel
it's
an
extreme
argument,
whereas
i
think
the
government's
argument
that
says--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--i
would
think
that--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that's
right.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
i
think
so.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
well,
the
court
of
appeals
found
facts
concerning
mr.
jenkins'
testimony
which
were
rejected
by
the
district
court.
it
read
more
into
his
testimony.
it
felt
that
his
testimony
was
entirely
supported--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--that's
correct.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that
was,
the
court
of
appeals
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
district
court,
which
sat
there
listening
to
all
the
witnesses.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
no,
i
don't
think
so,
i
think
that--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--well,
maybe
i
misstated
it.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
in
effect...
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
expressed
the
same
confusion
that
may
have
resulted
in
the
reading
of
chaunt
itself,
because
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
own
decision
on
the
same
page
interposed
the
terms
"might"
and
"would".
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that's
correct,
i
think
the
district
court
simply
ruled
that
there
was
a
possibility--
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
--the
court
of
appeals;
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
there
was
a
possibility,
and
certainly
that's
all
the
government
had
to
prove,
just
the
possibility.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
yes,
i
think
they
did
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
brian
m.
gildea
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
burden
is
two
fold,
the
burden
of
the
petitioner
not
being
able
to
offer
the
witnesses
that
would
support
his
claim
of
involuntary
service.
those
were
witnesses
that
were
in
the
soviet
union,
and
which
the
district
court
moved
were
not
essential
in
its
decision
in
this
case.
and
the
burden
of
the
government
in
establishing
witnesses
that
were
present
at
the
time,
being
able
to
give
evidence
to
the
court
as
to
the
circumstances
then
and
there
existing.
