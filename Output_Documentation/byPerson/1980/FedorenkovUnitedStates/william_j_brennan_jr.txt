justice
jr.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
mr
gildea,
jenkins
was
also
a
vice
consul,
was
he
not?
justice
jr.
and
he
testified,
did
he
not,
that
a
guard
who
served
in
a
concentration
camp
was
ineligible
as
a
of
law
for
a
visa,
did
he
not?
justice
jr.
and
that's
what
he
testified.
i
know
that
the
district
judge
did
not
accept...
he
testified
as
an
expert,
as
i
recall,
wasn't
it?
and
the...
that
was
not
accepted,
or
made
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
judge.
but
had
it
been
jenkins'
testimony
to
that
effect,
would
that
not
be
the
end
of
the
case?
wouldn't
that
satisfy
the
first
chaunt
test?
justice
jr.
but
if
you
look
at
it
the
other
way,
mr.
gildea,
if
the
test
is
that
it
would
have
triggered
an
investigation
that
might
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
facts,
whether
or
not
it
in
fact
did,
that's
all
the
government's
burden
is.
that's
very
different,
isn't
it,
from
what
you
insist
on?
you
put
the
"would"
at
the
place
i
suggested
maybe
should
be
read
"might".
justice
jr.
you
do
wind
up,
that
the
investigation
must
uncover
facts
the
government
must
prove,
that
the
investigation
would
have
uncovered
facts
which
would
have
resulted
in
the
denial
of
naturalization.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
jr.
whereas,
it's
a
lesser
burden
for
the
government
if
all
they
have
to
prove
is
that
it
would
have
triggered
an
investigation
that
might
have
led
to
facts.
justice
jr.
well,
isn't
that
what
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government
is?
justice
jr.
but
the
second
half,
mr.
attorney
general,
is
"might",
not
"would",
have
discovered
fact
which
would
have
led
to
the
denial
of
citizenship.
justice
jr.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
it
is
not
that
the
government
has
to
prove
that
the
investigation
would
have
turned
up
facts
that
would
have
required
the
denial
of
citizenship,
but
rather
that
it
might
have
required
a
denial
of
citizenship
after
an
investigation.
justice
jr.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
mr.
attorney
general,
if
jenkins'
testimony
had
been
believed,
namely,
that
had
it
been
known
at
the
time
a
visa
was
applied
for
that
this
chap
had
been
a
guard
at
the
camp,
he
would
not
have
been
given
a
visa.
if
that
had
been
found
as
a
fact,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
first
part
of
the
chaunt
test
would
have
been
satisfied?
justice
jr.
are
you
urging
here
that
this
court
turn
this
case
on
that
testimony?
