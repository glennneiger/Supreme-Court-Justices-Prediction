what's
the
difference
between
that,
and
"possibly
leading

the

justice

well,
that
was
not
the
basis,
in
any
event,
on
which
this
person
was
denaturalized.
justice
stewart
this
petitioner
was
denaturalized
for
concealment
of
material
facts
or
deliberate
misrepresentation,
was
he
not?
justice
stewart
but
in
the
statutory
language
he
was
denaturalized
on
the
grounds
that
i
stated,
was
he
not?
justice
stewart
that
i
stated;
denaturalized.
justice
stewart
well,
first
of
all
the
government
has
to
show
that
there
was
concealment,
doesn't
it?
justice
stewart
now,
this
isn't
a
case...
and
i
don't
know
if
there
is
a
statute
which
says
that
regardless
of
how
honest
the
applicant
was,
if
there
were
in
fact
circumstances
that
would
have
made
him
ineligible
for
citizenship
he
can
be
denaturalized.
this
is
not
such
a
case?
justice
stewart
this
case
is
based
upon
his
concealment.
justice
stewart
i
think
i'm
the
only
survivor.
but
there
were
three.
justice
stewart
--well,
he
would
never
have
been
in
a
position
to
apply
for
naturalization.
supposing
for
example
that
at
the
time
he
applied
for
a
visa
they
were
only
issuing
visas
to
college
graduates
or
married
persons
or
something
like
that,
and
he
had
concealed
his
marital
status
or
his
educational
status,
and
therefore
got
a
visa;
then
came
over
and
lived
here
for
20
or
30
years,
and
then
filed
the
same
kind
of
application
for
naturalization
he
did
here.
would
the
government
be
entitled
to
denaturalize
that
person?
