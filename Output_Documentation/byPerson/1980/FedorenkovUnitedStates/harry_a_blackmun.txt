justice
blackmun
counsel,
just
as
a
matter
of
practical
information,
if
mr.
fedorenko
loses
this
appeal
or
this
review,
what
happens
to
him?
is
he
deportable?
justice
blackmun
within
three
weeks
of
his
induction?
justice
blackmun
mr.
gildea,
i
fell
off
the
wagon
in
your
last
comment.
i
have
chaunt
in
front
of
me.
"we
only
conclude
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
government
has
failed
to
show
by
clear,
unequivocal,
and
convincing
evidence
either
(1)
or
(2),
that
their
disclosure
might
have
been
useful.
"
did
you
say
that
they
said
it
would
have
been
useful?
justice
blackmun
well,
i'll
read
(2)
again,
that
"their
disclosure
might
have
been
useful.
"
reading
on--
justice
blackmun
--i'm
reading
from
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
majority
opinion.
justice
blackmun
well
then,
you're
saying
that
the
court's
opinion
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
this
is
not
the
first
time
but--
justice
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
justice
clark
was
not
alone
in
dissent
chaunt,
was
he?
