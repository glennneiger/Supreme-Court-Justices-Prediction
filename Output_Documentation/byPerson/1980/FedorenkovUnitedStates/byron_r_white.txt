justice
white
that's
a
test
more
favorable
to
you,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
take
it
then
you
think
a
court
dealing
with
a
case
like
this
must
decide
whether
or
not
the
facts
about
your
client,
if
they
had
been
revealed
or
if
an
investigation
had
revealed
all
the
facts,
the
true
facts,
the
courts
would
have
to
decide
whether
those
facts
would
warrant
the
denial
of
citizenship.
justice
white
but
pursuing
my
question,
assume
you're
right
on
what
the
standard
is,
is
it
clear
that
his
service
as
a
guard
would
not
have
disqualified
him
for
citizenship
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
white
and
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
to
reach,
i
take
it?
justice
white
so
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
facts
which
it
decided
would
have
denied
him
citizenship?
justice
white
well,
then--
justice
white
--well,
and
suppose
the
court
of
appeals,
we
accept
that,
then,
then
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government
is
sort
of
irrelevant
as
to
what
the
standard
is
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
some
new
facts,
but
it
also
found
that
those
facts
would
have
denied
him
citizenship?
is
that
what
they
did?
justice
white
well,
you
just
said
it
was.
justice
white
so
you...
you're
suggesting,
then,
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
facts
as
found
by
them
would
have?
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
no,
but
did
it...
it
found
some
facts.
did
it
say
that
on
these
facts,
which
we
think
the
record
reveals,
these
facts
would
have
resulted
in
his
denial
of
citizenship?
justice
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit
said
that
"the
evidence
before
the
district
court
clearly
and
convincingly
proved
that
had
the
defendant
disclosed
his
guard
service
the
american
authorities
would
have
conducted
an
inquiry
that
might
have
resulted
in
denial
of
a
visa.
"
now,
you
must
believe
and
must
urge
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
majority
in
the
chaunt
case.
justice
white
even
though
justice
clark
suggested
that
the
majority
had
rejected
a
very
similar
test.
justice
white
but
in
any
event
this
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
wouldn't
require
actual
proof
of
facts
that
would
have
resulted
in
denial
of
citizenship
but
it
would
require
the
government
to
prove
that
they
might
have
found
facts,
and
the
burden
of
the
court
of
appeals
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
government
must
need
some
protection
from
the
disappearance
of
facts.
