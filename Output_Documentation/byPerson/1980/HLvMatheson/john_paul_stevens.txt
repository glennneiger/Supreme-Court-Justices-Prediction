justice
stevens
mr.
dolowitz,
before
you
leave
those
other
cases,
i
don't
understand
their
relevance
to
the
issue
presented
by
this
case.
justice
stevens
well,
let's
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
lot
of
people
who
are
not
before
the
court.
assume
that.
how
does
that
help
you
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
i
thought
you
just
agreed
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
there
was
no
such
determination,
the
child
so
determined
after
consultation
with
the
doctor
and
the
social
worker?
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
tinker,
the
class
described
in
the
complaint,
as
i
understand
the
trial
judge,
he
did
in
effect
say
the
class
was
proper,
includes
all
minor
women
who
are
suffering
unwanted
pregnancies
and
desire
to
terminate
them,
which
would
include
the
emancipated
minors
as
well
as
the
unemancipated
minors.
i'm
looking
at
page
5
of
the
appendix.
there
is
nothing
in
the
supreme
court
of
utah's
opinion
that
says,
we
are
only
deciding
the
question
presented
by
the
named
plaintiff
as
opposed
to
the
class
as
a
whole
which
had
been
certified.
justice
stevens
except
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
state
judge
said
she's
an
adequate
representative.
and
his
reasoning
would
apply
equally
to
emancipated
or
unemancipated,
and
the
reasoning
of
the
utah
supreme
court
would
apply
equally
to
both.
now,
maybe
the
federal
cases
are
different,
but
it
seems
that
if
you
have
a
class
which
as
a
matter
of
state
law
includes
emancipated
minors,
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
disposed
of
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
all
before
the
court,
we
have
that
issue,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
shouldn't
decide
it.
unless,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
a
particular
plaintiff
doesn't
have
standing
to
make
a
particular
argument.
that's
right.
and
the
trial
judge
did
confine
it,
as
i
read
his
opinion
on
page
14,
the
last
part
of
it,
"under
the
facts
involved
here
where
the
woman
in
question
is
aged
15,
unmarried,
resides
at
home
with
her
parents
and
is
dependent
upon
them
for
support,
and
where
the
identity
of
the
parents
is
either
known
to
the
physician
or
easily
ascertainable
by
him.
"
he
did
indicate
that
his
reasoning,
at
least,
was
confined
to
the
facts
of
this
case
in
upholding
the
facial
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
it
was
all
that
he
did
and
all
the
supreme
court
of
utah
did.
justice
stevens
had
he
certified
the
class?
that
was
in
his
order
denying
the
temporary
injunction.
didn't
he
thereafter
describe
the...
except
the
class?
maybe
we
shouldn't
take
your
time
with
this.
justice
stevens
mr.
tinker,
may
i
ask
on
this
subject,
i
think
the
record
is
a
little
unclear.
as
justice
stewart
has
correctly
pointed
out,
the
trial
judge
did
emphasize
the
specific
facts
here
in
denying
the
injunction.
then
later
on
there's
reference
to
the
class
she
purports
to
represent.
so
i
have
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
mature
minor
or
emancipated
minor
issue
is
here.
but
assume
for
the
moment
it
is
and
recognizing
that
the
point
is
not
clear,
what
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
utah?
(a)
does
the
statute
apply
to
the
emancipated
minor?
and
secondly,
is
the
statute
then
constitutional?
justice
stevens
that's
a
little
ambiguous
to
me.
on
that
point
he
gave
alternative
findings.
justice
stevens
and
now
what
is
it
you
don't
disagree
with?
justice
stevens
do
you
have
an
opinion
as
to
the
matter
of
state
law?
first
of
all,
do
you
have
an
opinion
as
a
matter
of
state
law
as
to
whether
it
should
be
construed
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
apply
to
emancipated
minors?
justice
stevens
and
is
there
any
judicial
authority
in
the
state
that
has
so
construed
the
statute,
other
than
federal
judges?
any
state
judges?
justice
stevens
well,
you're
in
effect
saying
the
statute
doesn't
mean
what
it
would
appear
to
mean
to
an
uninitiated
reader
insofar
as
it
excludes
a
class
of
minors
which
are
not
identified
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
does
it
also
exclude
a
class
of
married
women?
i
was
wondering
if
it
is
as
broad
in
that
area
as
it
appears
to
be?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
requirement
of
notice
to
the
husband
of
a
married
woman.
justice
stevens
by
emancipated,
you
are
referring
to
a
young
person
who
is
married
and
therefore
not
a
minor
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
an
emancipated
minor
is
somebody
living
away
from
her
parents
and
living
independently,
among
other
things.
and
unmarried?
justice
stevens
now,
is
that
person
covered
by
the
statute?
i
think
i
know
your
answer
but
i'm--
--well,
he
said
in
his
opinion
it
is
or
ought
to
be.
no,
no.
he
said
it
was
not
covered.
not
covered.
but
he
said
there's
no
state
ruling
on
the
subject.
justice
stevens
i
apologize.
the
statute
does
apply
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
in
your
opinion,
to
such
a
person?
justice
stevens
but
it's
just
a
matter
of
his
opinion,
in
any
event.
i
understand
that
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
his
opinion
is.
your
opinion
is,
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
that
person?
justice
stevens
unmarried;
an
emancipated
minor.
justice
stevens
but
you
do
say,
if
she
were
away
from
home
it
would
not
apply?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
how
all
those
criteria
can
be
found
in
this
rather
short
statute.
you
seem
to
agree
they
can't.
justice
stevens
you
said
if
she's
emancipated,
the
statute
doesn't
apply
and
those
are
all
the
things
you
look
at
and
decide
whether
she's
emancipated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dolowitz,
do
you
agree
with
justice
brennan
that
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
that
if
10
minutes
before
performing
the
abortion
the
doctor
called
up
the
parents
and
said,
i'm
about
to
abort
your
daughter,
i
want
to
give
you
notice
in
compliance
with
the
statute.
he
does
so
and
then
aborts.
there
would
be
no
danger
to
interference
with
the...
i
mean,
it
would
be
no
violation
of
the
statute
if
he
went
ahead
and
there
would
be
no
terrible
danger
that
he
could--
justice
stevens
--and
if
it's
that
easy
to
comply
with
it,
how
can
you
seriously
argue
that
it
substantially
burdens
the,
a
woman's
private
right
to
choose
a
decision?
justice
stevens
so
you'd
say
it
would
be
equally
unconstitutional
if
there
was
a
requirement
that
two
hours
after
an
abortion
is
performed
they
notify
the
parents
because
they
might
be
unhappy
about
it?
