we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
h.
l.
and
others
against
matheson,
the
governor
of
utah.
mr.
dolowitz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

appendix?
chief
justice
burger
mr.
dolowitz,
you
have
emphasized
in
your
oral
argument...
you
have
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
it,
and
our
questions,
and
you
did
in
the
examination,
direct
examination
of
your
witness,
the
importance,
you
have
emphasized
the
importance
of
getting
counsel
and
advice
and
assistance,
lawyers,
social
workers,
doctors.
and
you
rest
on
the
fact
that
she
had
the
advice
and
counsel
of
all
these
people?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
she
has
the
advice
of
no
one?
just
walked
in
off
the
street
and
said,
i
want
to
have
an
abortion,
and
the
doctor
said,
not
unless
i
notify
the
parents.
no
other
factors.
would
this
be
any
different
from
the
points
that
you
have
got
here?
chief
justice
burger
and
factually,
would
it
be--
chief
justice
burger
--you
don't
need
to
speculate
on
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
burger
you
don't
need
to
speculate
on
the
constitutional
question,
do
you?
chief
justice
burger
it
would
make
no
difference,
would
it?
chief
justice
burger
now,
she's
15
years
old,
isn't
she?
chief
justice
burger
suppose
she
were
12?
same?
chief
justice
burger
what
about
ten
years
of
age?
chief
justice
burger
in
utah,
under
utah
law,
if
she
had
walked
in,
a
girl
of
10,
11,
12,
15,
whatever,
and
said,
i
want
my
tonsils
taken
out
but
my
parents
won't
send
me
to
a
doctor
and
won't
agree
to
it,
would
the
doctor
be
legally
permitted
to
perform
the
tonsillectomy?
chief
justice
burger
because
of
the
possibility
of
a
malpractice
suit,
among
other
things,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
burger
then
are
you
saying
that
it
might,
the
statute
might
be
constitutional
if
it
fixed
the
limit
at
age
12
or
14?
chief
justice
burger
but
could
it
not
also,
could
that
phrase
not
also
be
intended
to
take
into
account
a
child
who
had
been
abandoned
by
her
parents,
didn't
know
where
her
parents
were,
her
parents
impossible
to
reach,
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
burger
isn't
that
what
the
statute
is
aimed
at?
chief
justice
burger
nothing
in
the
record
about
that
here.
have
you
got
something
in
the
record
about
giving
notice?
chief
justice
burger
well...
no,
no,
the
possibility,
the
capability,
the
feasibility
of
writing
a
letter
to
the
parents.
chief
justice
burger
had
the
doctor
written
a
letter
simply
stating
the
simple,
direct
fact
that,
your
daughter
has
come
to
me
to
have
an
abortion
performed
and
i'm
prepared
to
do
it,
and
under
the
statute
i'm
giving
you
notice
that
i
will
proceed
with
this
procedure
seven
days
from
today,
would
he
have
complied
with
the
statute?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
my
earlier
question
about
whether
it
affects
your
case
one
way
or
the
other...
it
would
affect
it
one
way
or
the
other,
if
there
had
been
no
consultation
with
anyone.
the
girl,
10,
12,
14,
15,
walked
in
off
the
street
and
said,
i
want
the
abortion,
and
the
doctor
said,
all
right,
i'll
give
the
notice,
or,
i
won't
give
the
notice.
is
the
counseling
of
any
relevance
here
to
a
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
dolowitz.
mr.
tinker.
chief
justice
burger
do
you
see
any
inherent
conflict
between
the
federal
court
case
and
this
one?
chief
justice
burger
a
little
due
process
for
the
parents,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
burger
is
it
possible
the
legislature
had
in
mind
that...
or
is
it
possible
that
it's
inherent
in
the
case,
that
the
parents
might
be
able
to
give
something
of
the
medical
history
and
background
of
the
child
which
would
be
relevant
to
the
doctor
and
his
decision?
chief
justice
burger
what
if
the
mother
in
that
hypothetical
case
then
said,
are
you
aware,
doctor,
that
our
daughter
has
been
under
psychiatric
care
for
the
last
seven
years,
and
the
doctor,
says,
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
is
that
something
he
merely
must
apply
to
his
medical
decision--
chief
justice
burger
--well,
that
might
mean,
among
other
things,
that
the
minor
patient
was
not
capable
of
giving
consent
to
anything,
a
tonsillectomy,
an
appendectomy,
or
an
abortion.
might
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
also,
maturity
and
immaturity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dolowitz,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
burger
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
that
problem
now,
do
we?
chief
justice
burger
well,
if
marriage
emancipates
a
minor
woman,
divorce
does
not
probably
vitiate--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
