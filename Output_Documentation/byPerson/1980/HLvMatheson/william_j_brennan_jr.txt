justice
jr.
well,
mr.
dolowitz,
i
think
you
referred
us
to
this
finding
7,
didn't
you,
at
page
40?
justice
jr.
am
i
to
read
that
finding
as
you
have
just
stated
the
proposition,
that
after
consultation...
or
rather,
when
consulting
with
her
physician,
he
advised
her
that
she
should
be
aborted,
that
he
was
unwilling
to
perform
an
abortion
without
complying
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute
even
though
he
believed
it
was
best
to
do
so,
or
to
perform
the
abortion
without
complying
with
the
statute?
is
that
the
way
we're
supposed
to
read
that?
justice
jr.
is
that
the
way
you
want
us
to
read
that?
justice
jr.
that's
what
we
read
into
it,
even
though
he
believed
it
was
best
to
do
so.
justice
jr.
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
it
is
you
say
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
notification.
suppose
he's
about
ready
to
perform
the
abortion.
before
he
does
he
picks
up
the
telephone,
he
gets
hold
of
the
mother
of
the
girl,
and
he
says,
i
have
your
daughter
here,
i'm
about
to
perform
an
abortion.
goodbye.
does
that
do
it?
justice
jr.
then
how
much
input
does
this
contemplate
that
the
parents
will
have?
justice
jr.
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
they
don't
have
to.
the
statute
doesn't
require
them
to
go
beyond
what
i
suggested?
justice
jr.
are
we
to
assume
she's
an
immature
minor?
justice
jr.
aren't
you
saying
that
if
there's
any
maturity
element
in
this
case
at
all
it's
in
the
use
of
the
word
18
and
over
18?
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
you
don't
concede
that
someone
might
be
15
and
mature?
justice
jr.
well,
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
this
15-year-old
is
not
either,
is
there,
in
this
record?
well,
doesn't
the
action
of
the
state
legislature
amount
to
a
declaration
that
prima
facie
or
presumptively
a
woman
under
the
age
of
18,
if
not
emancipated,
is
too
immature
to
make
that
decision,
at
least
without
notice
to
the
parents?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
let
me
ask
you
again,
is
that
to
say,
if
there
were
evidence
in
this
case
that
this
15-year-old
was
mature,
then
the
statute
would
not
apply?
justice
jr.
does
utah
have
one
of
those
certification
statutes?
