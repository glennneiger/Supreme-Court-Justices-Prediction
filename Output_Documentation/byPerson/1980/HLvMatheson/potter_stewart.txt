the...
now,
who's
"she"?
the
social
worker?
justice
stewart
now,
who
made
that
determination?
justice
stewart
by
h.
l..
justice
stewart
--in
your
statement
of
the
case,
in
your
brief,
mr.
dolowitz,
you
say,
"in
consultation
with
both
her
physician
and
social
worker,
she
determined
that
it
was
in
her
best
medical
interest
that
she
be
aborted
and
that
her
parents
not
be
notified
of
either
her
decision
or
its
implementation.
"
justice
stewart
and
that's
a
fair
paraphrase
of
what
you
read
us,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
those
four
plaintiffs
were
all
emancipated
were
they
not?
not
living
with
the
parents?
justice
stewart
she's
challenging
the
statute
on
its
face,
not
as
it
applies
to
her,
isn't
she?
justice
stewart
now,
somebody
else,
an
emancipated...
let's
assume
that
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
has
already
decided
that
the
statute
on
its
face
is
constitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
court
out
in
your
state
has
decided
that
as
applied
to
an
emancipated
minor
the
statute,
if
it
does
apply
to
an
emancipated
minor,
is
unconstitutional.
justice
stewart
she's
not...
in
this
case,
the
statute
is
not
being
challenged
as
applied,
but
it's
simply
being
challenged
on
its
face,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
what
is
a
minor
in
utah?
justice
stewart
therefore
this
statute
could
be,
its
constitutional
validity
could
be
attacked
as
it
applies
to
people
over
17,
for
example.
justice
stewart
but
here
it's
being
attacked
on
its
face--
justice
stewart
--who
is
living
at
home.
justice
stewart
i
have
that...
i
haven't
read
it
recently,
but
i
thought
the
purpose
of
the
constitutional
requirement
that
the
plaintiff,
pregnant,
unmarried
female,
be
allowed
to
go
to
a
court
was
to
convince
that
court
that
she
was
a
mature
minor.
there's
no
claim
here,
is
there,
that
the
plaintiff
is
a
mature
minor?
justice
stewart
not
that
she's
an
immature
minor,
is
there?
justice
stewart
it's
not
clear
at
all
that
she's
a
mature
minor
or
was
prohibited
or
prevented
from
showing
a
court
that
she
was.
justice
stewart
there
wasn't
in
the
massachusetts
legislation
either,
and
that's
what
we
found
constitutionally
deficient,
as
i
remember.
justice
stewart
despite
the
failure
to
give
consent.
but
the
court
held,
as
i
remember
it,
that
the
minor
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
court
for
a
determination
that
she
was
a
mature
minor
and
that
therefore
no
effort
to
get
consent
was
required.
but
now,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
present
case,
which
doesn't,
of
course,
involve
consent
but
rather
notice
alone,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
mature
minor
and/or
that
she
was
prevented
from
going
to
a
court
to
show
that
she
was,
is
there?
justice
stewart
under
the
district
courts,
under
the
holding
in
the
federal
court,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
emancipated
minors,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
well,
i
understand
in
utah,
once
a
woman
is
married,
whatever
her
age
she
is
no
longer
a
minor?
justice
stewart
well,
we
don't
have
that
case.
