justice
rehnquist
where
in
the
record,
counsel,
is
the
finding
or
testimony
that
the
doctor
felt
the
parents
should
not
be
consulted?
justice
rehnquist
could
you
cite
the
pages?
justice
rehnquist
i
read
the
transcript.
the
physician
felt
he
could
not
do
it
without
consulting
the
parents.
but
i
didn't
read
the
transcript
to
find
any
place
that
he
felt
it
was
in
her
best
interest
that
the
parents
not
be
consulted.
wasn't
it
a
matter
of
notice
to
the
parents
rather
than
consulting
the
parents?
justice
rehnquist
now,
where
in
the
transcript
or
findings
do
you
find
anything
that
the
physician
thought
it
was
contrary
to
her
best
medical
interest
that
her
parents
not
be
notified?
justice
rehnquist
where
in
what
we
have
before
us?
justice
rehnquist
could
you
give
us
the
verbatim?
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
any
of
what
you
have
read
from
the
testimony
so
far
supports
a
finding
that
her
doctor
told
her
that
it
was
in
her...
not
in
her
best
medical
interests
to
get
an
abortion?
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
your--
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
a
finding
that
the
doctor
told
her
it
was
against
her
best
interest?
justice
rehnquist
you
don't
suggest
anything
that
you
read
from
the
transcript
said
the
doctor
said
it
was
not
in
her
best
interest
to
notify
the
parents?
justice
rehnquist
we
review
questions
or
cases
on
transcripts,
not
on
unasked
questions.
justice
rehnquist
it's
a
very
ambiguous
finding,
isn't
it,
if
you
read
it
with
all
the
nuances
that
mr.
justice
brennan
puts
in
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
a
minor
still
living
at
home
can
challenge
the
statute
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
just
described,
which
does
not
limit
it
that
way?
does
she
have
standing?
justice
rehnquist
does
the
minor
living
at
home
have
standing
to
challenge
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it's
overbroad
as
to
minors
who
are
not
living
at
home?
justice
rehnquist
oh,
if
she
is
not
a
minor,
there
is
no
requirement
of
notification.
justice
rehnquist
if
she
is
married,
whatever
her
age,
or
whatever
his
age.
justice
rehnquist
if
she's
not
a
minor,
there's
no
requirement
of
notification
to
her
parents?
justice
rehnquist
did
the
state
make
any
motion
for
the
federal
district
court
to
abstain
on
the
question
of
state
law
construction?
justice
rehnquist
what
are
you...
you'll
lose
that
point.
doesn't
all
of
this
add
up
to
making
some
sense
of
the
idea
that
we
have
not
applied
the
overbreadth
doctrine
except
in
cases
dealing
with
free
speech
generally
as
a
matter
of
standards?
justice
rehnquist
but
you
were
free
also
to
go
to
the
circuit
justice
and
ask
for
the
same
relief,
were
you
not?
