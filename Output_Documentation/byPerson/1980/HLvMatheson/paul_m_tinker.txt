mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes.
i
agree,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
enacting
the
statue
which
is
at
issue
here,
the
parents
in
the
state
of
utah...
and
after
all,
it's
parents
who
are
of
voting
age
and
who
are
represented
in
the
utah
legislature...
have
essentially
said
something
to
the
effect
as
follows:
yes,
we
recognize
that
it
is
not
possible
under
the
constitution
for
us
to
exercise
any
kind
of
absolute
veto
or
place
a
roadblock,
an
absolute
roadblock,
in
the
way
of
our
minor
daughter
who
is
living
at
home
and
who
may
seek
to
have
an
abortion.
and
it
should
be
noted
that
we've
conceded
this
even
in,
as
early
as
1974,
which
is
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
which
precedes
both
the
danforth
decision
and
the
first
bellotti
decision.
but,
even
if
we
may
not
veto
the
decision
of
our
minor
daughter
living
at
home
who
chooses
to
have
an
abortion,
we
at
least
want
to
know
about
it.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no.
the
statute
on
its
face--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--merely
for
emphasis,
in
that
that
is
who
the
statute
is
primarily
intended
to
control.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
minors,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
and
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
separate
question
which
is
raised
by
this
other
case
that
mr.
dolowitz
has
referred
to,
and
which
mr.
justice
stevens
has
questioned
the
relevance
here.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
question
of
the
emancipated
minor
is
not
before
this
court,
is
not
part
of
this
record.
it
is--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--that's
true.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
right.
and
the
statute
on
its
face
describes
only
"minors".
and
my
suggestion,
which
i
don't
think
is
entirely
relevant
in
this
case,
but
is
clearly
the
heart
of
this
other
case
that
is
still
pending,
is
whether
under
utah
law,
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
utah
law,
that
term
minor
includes
emancipated
minors.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
does
the
minor
not
living
at
home
have
standing?
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
minor
has
that
standing.
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
case
presented
here
at
all.
the
case
presented
here
is
a
minor
15
years
old
living
at
home,
challenging
the
statute
as
it
applies
to
her.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
reasonable
question
that
can
be
raised
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
her.
there
can
be
a
question
raised,
i
think
as
to
whether
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
emancipated
minor.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
yes.
she
is--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes.
but
i
would
see
the
facial
challenge
as
being
substantially
different
if
there
were
an
authoritative
construction
of
the
statute
that
said
it
cannot,
by
virtue
of
state
law,
apply
to
emancipated
minors.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
under
18,
unless
married.
minors
achieve
their
majority
under
utah
law
if
they
are
married;
otherwise,
not
till
18.
now,
that's
by
statutory
law.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--by
a
15-year-old
who
it
clearly--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--does
apply
to;
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
the
federal
trial
court
judge
has
taken
pains
in
his
findings
to
differentiate
between
what
the
utah
supreme
court
found.
he
has
felt
that
that
decision
is
binding
as
far
as
state
law
is
concerned,
so
far
as
it
goes.
and
he
sees
this
as
presenting
a
different
class
and
a
different
issue.
that's
why
i
suggest
that
that
case
is
irrelevant
in
this
case
as
it
presently
stands
before
this
court.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
but
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
that
alone,
the
fact
that
the
class
was
not
defined
to
exclude
all
these
others,
permits
the
named
plaintiff
to
represent
a
class
that
she's
not
part
of.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
at
least
there
was
no
discussion--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--well,
i
think
the
class
was
essentially
defined
at
that
preliminary
stage
and
it
was
not
changed
in
the
subsequent
proceedings.
let
me
suggest,
further,
what
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
utah
was
doing.
they're
saying
that
with
respect
to
minors
generally
we
as
parents
forego
any
claim
to
being
able
to
veto
an
abortion
decision
but
if
there
is
to
be
an
abortion
performed,
we
simply
want
notice
of
it.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
that's
exactly
i'm
saying,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we
want
to
know
about
it.
we
would
ideally
like
to
have
some
input,
perhaps
some
consultation.
but
even
by
this
statute
we
do
not
mandate
that.
the
statute
on
its
face
could
be
satisfied
as
one
of
the
briefs
has
suggested
by
a
mere
telephone
call
at
a
certain
point
prior
to
the
performance
of
the
abortion,
advising
that
the
abortion
will
take
place.
that
might
not
be
an
entirely
satisfactory
kind
of
performance
under
the
statute,
but
it
would
be
sufficient,
i
think,
to
preclude
any
criminal
penalty
upon
the
doctor.
the
parents
are--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--among
other
things.
he
may,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
obtain
additional
information
that
he
might
not
know
in
the
case
of
a
girl
of
tender
years,
by
talking
with
her
parents.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
it
does
not
take
into
account
that
particular
situation.
the
parents
are
saying,
we
not
only
want
a
little
due
process,
but
they're
saying,
we
would
like
to
enhance
the
full
range
of
choices
that
our
daughter
may
have
in
this
matter.
we
recognize
that
the
trend
of
things,
if
you
will,
in
our
society
is
very
much
in
the
direction
that
abortion
will
be
viewed
by
a
great
many
people,
especially
the
professionals,
the
counselors,
the
doctors,
and
so
forth,
as
the
option
of
choice
in
this
situation.
in
some
cases
we
may
if
we
had
the
chance
merely
like
to
give
another
viewpoint
there.
not
that
our
viewpoint
could
be
binding,
by
any
means,
and
not
even
that
the
statute
requires
the
consultation,
but
merely
that
the
doctor
must
give
the
opportunity
for
the
parents
to
know
and
then
it
essentially
becomes
the
doctor's
own
problem
as
a
matter
of
ethics.
it's
really
thrown
back
entirely
into
the
private
sector
without
the
state
being
involved.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
the
utah
supreme
court
in
its
unanimous
decision
made
that
specific
finding
but
that
would
be
one
of
the
purposes.
i
don't
think
that's
the
only
purpose,
but
i
think
that
is
a
very
significant
one.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i'm
afraid
it
does,
mr.
justice
brennan,
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
as
i
say,
i
don't--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--well,
it
contemplates,
i
think,
only
as
much
as
the
doctor
in
his
professional
judgment
will
permit.
but
i
think
most
doctors,
given
the
requirement
that
they
must
go
at
least
that
far,
will
at
least
be
willing
to
hear
a
few
things.
now,
this
gets
us
off
into
speculation
again.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
clearly
not;
clearly
not.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i
think
he
has...
excuse
me,
i
think
he
has
a
professional
obligation
to
then
take
that
knowledge
into
account.
again,
the
law
of
the
state
of
utah
probably
does
not
compel
him
to
do
that
unless
it
were
so
egregious
that
it
became
a
matter
of
malpractice.
and
in
that
respect,
the
statute
may
tend
to
protect
the
doctor.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
it
could
be.
you
have
an
interesting
kind
of
overlap
in
my
view
of
legal
disabilities
that
are
occasioned
simply
by
minority
and
legal
disabilities
that
are
occasioned
by
absolute
lack
of
competency,
mental
type
lack
of
competency.
you
might
have
those
overlapping,
fitting
in
the
same
situation
here.
i
think
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
been
that
as
far
as
those
disabilities
which
occur
as
simply
because
of
lack
of
majority
status
are
somewhat
tempered,
somewhat
moderated
or
modified
when
you're
in
the
abortion
context
or
in
the
other
contexts
regarding
the
ability
to
procreate.
but
there
you
get
into
a
very
difficult
situation
when
you
bring
both
of
them
in
and
again
you
have
a
difficult
kind
of
balancing
problem.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i
construe
that
language
as
relating
to
the
situation
of
the
massachusetts
statute
which
was
a
consent
statute,
not
a
mere
notice
statute
like
ours,
and
which
already
created
the
possibility
of
alternatives.
the
question
of
notice,
which
is
presented
in
what
i
would
suggest
is
a
pure
form
in
our
particular
case
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statute,
was
presented
in
a
much
more
complicated
scheme
in
the
massachusetts
case.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
right.
but
the
reason
there
was
an
alternative
in
massachusetts
was
that
there
was
consent
required.
you
had
to
get
consent
from
somebody.
in
utah
you
don't
have
to
get
consent
from
anybody.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
not
in
the
pleadings
of
this
case
or
in
the
record.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i'm
sorry?
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i
believe
so.
i
don't
know
of
a
finding
to
the
contrary.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
in
utah
we
don't
have
a
specific
procedure
for
showing
a
court
any--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--my
recollection
was
that
the
massachusetts
statute
provided
that
if
a
parent
refused
to
give
consent
or
was
unavailable,
that
you
could
then
repair
to
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
and
seek
an
order
granting
the
consent
in
place
of
parent--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--i
don't
believe
there
is
such
a
claim,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
that's
sort
of
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
mr.
justice
stevens.
but
the--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--if
it
applies,
he
essentially
found
in
the
alternative.
either
it
does
not
apply
to
them,
or
if
it
does,
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
them.
and
i
don't
disagree
with
the
findings
of
the
federal
district
court
on
that
point.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
that
it
either
doesn't
apply
or
that
if
it
should
be
found
to
apply
it's
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
those.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes,
i
have
an
opinion,
and
my
opinion
is
that
it
should
be
construed
so
as
not
to
apply
to
an
emancipated
minor.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no.
it
has
not
been
before
the
state
courts
for
that
kind
of
an
interpretation.
it's
not
been...
interestingly
enough,
in
contrast
to
the
many
abortion
kinds
of
statutes
which
have
been
so
severely
restricted
and
have
been
attacked
even
before
they
went
into
effect,
this
statute
has
been
in
effect,
was
in
effect
for
about
four
years
before
it
was
even
challenged
on
this
parental
notice
issue.
and
this
case
that
is
presently
before
the
court
and
the
other
case
that
mr.
dolowitz
has
supplied
the
information
regarding,
that's
still
pending
in
the
federal
district
court,
are
the
only
two
cases
that
i
know
of,
and
i'm
sure
they're
the
only
two
cases
that
exist.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
i
don't
think
it
applies
to
married
women
at
all
because
in
utah
the
statutory
provision
is
that
all
minors
achieve
their
majority
by
marriage.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
oh.
well,
that...
i
see
that
as
a
completely
separate
problem.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
right.
but
another
part
of
the
statute
which
is
not
before
the
court
and
not
challenged
here
at
all
requires
notice
to
the
husband
and
that's
what
mr.
justice
stevens
is
referring
to.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
yes.
a
married
person
of
whatever
age.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
oh,
that's
definitely
correct.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
there's
no
question
that
she's
not
mature?
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
there's
no
question.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
no.
i'm
not
saying...
i
did
not
say,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
the
fact
that
she
was
mature
would
take
her
out
of
the
statute.
the
question
of
maturity
in--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--i
make
a
distinction.
one
class
is
married.
they
are
out
by
operation
of
law.
another
class
is
mature,
another
category
is
emancipated.
i
don't
believe
that
mature
and
emancipated
in
this
context
are
coextensive
categories.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
among
other
things.
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct
in
understanding
me
to
this
point
on
that
issue.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
not
to
the
emancipated
minors.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
to
the
emancipated
minor.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
living
away
from
home,
all
the
other
things.
see,
one
the
difficulties
is
determining
what
constitutes
an
emancipated
miner.
i
see
a
number
of
factors
which
go
into
that.
a
still
separate
problem
comes
when
you
try
to
determine
whether
the
minor
is
"mature".
i
think
that's
a
lesser
standard
and
a
minor
could
be
mature
without
being
emancipated.
the
statute
clearly
takes
in
all
minors
who
might
be
deemed
mature
and
this
comes
down
merely
to
a
question
of
legislative
line
drawing,
in
my
view.
the
legislature
had
to
make
a
category
of
who
were
included,
and
they
took
the
standard
definition
of
what
constitutes
the
line
between
minority
and
majority,
the
age
of
18.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
it's
an
arbitrary
decision,
in
a
sense,
as
to
what
constitutes--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--yes,
i
am
saying
that,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
oh,
i
concede
that
somebody
might
be
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
anyone
is.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
at
least
without
notice,
but
with
no
requirement
that
the
parent
can
control
the
decision.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
i
would
not
make
that
argument,
sir.
i
would
not
suggest
that.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
well,
if
she
were
away
from
home
and
if
all
the
other
factors...
and
this
is
what
we've
gone
through
before
judge
jenkins
in
the
federal
district
court,
is
trying
to
find
out
whether
a
particular
girl
is
emancipated
or
not.
and
he's
taken
into
account
where
she
was
living,
what
her
source
of
income
was,
whether
she's
living
apart
on
her
own
volition
or
whether
the
parents
had
something
to
do
with
that--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--well,
no,
i'm
saying--
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
--yes,
i'm
saying...
but
an
emancipated
person
is
not
under
terms
of
state
law
a
minor
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i
have
argued
the
abstention
question
in
the
l.
r.
case
and
judge
jenkins
said
that
he
would
not
abstain
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
exigencies
of
time.
the
girl
was
near
the
end
of
the
first
trimester,
nearing
the
point
where
the
possibility
of
an
abortion
was
complicated
if
it
went
longer
and
he
felt
that
to
send
this
back
to
a
state
court
would
aggravate
that
situation
and
so
he
refused
to
abstain
i
still
propose
to
ask
judge
jenkins
to
certify
the
question
to
the
utah
supreme
court,
whether...
this
precise
question
that
i've
been
discussing
with
mr.
justice
stevens,
of
whether
an
emancipated
minor
is
included
in
the
statute
at
all.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
i
just
found
out
recently
that
the
utah
supreme
court
adopted
by
a
minute
entry,
it's
not
in
their
rules,
but
they've
accepted
one
certification
in
the
past
and
they
tell
me
they're
willing
to
accept
them.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
the
statute
was
passed
in
1974.
that
was
the
point
that
i
thought
was
significant
in
that
it
came
before
danforth
and
before
bellotti
i
and
of
course
long
before
bellotti
ii.
it
was
passed
in
'74
and
challenged
in
this
case
in
1978.
a
particular
emphasis
that
i
would
like
to
give,
just
in
summary,
to
this
case
is
that
the
state
of
utah
has
chosen
in
this
sensitive
area
to
keep
the
state
and
its
mechanisms,
its
agencies,
and
everyone
else,
far
removed
from
the
decision
making
process.
it
has
seen
this
problem
as
being
one
to
be
handled
within
the
family
context.
and
that's
why
i
see
this
case
as
an
important
case
involving
what
the
limits
of
family
participation
are,
what
the
rights
of
the
family
as
a
unit
are.
the
appellant
has
painted
a
picture
of
many
adverse
consequences
that
might
come
to
a
young
lady
seeking
an
abortion
if
her
parents
were
notified.
the
problem
is
that
any
of
those
adverse
consequences
come
purely,
if
they
come
at
all...
which
is
not
in
the
record...
come
as
a
matter
of
private
action
of
parents.
there
is
no
state
action
involved.
the
state
has
no
right
to
veto
an
abortion
decision,
much
less
does
it
have
the
right
to
delegate
to
someone
else
the
right
to
veto
an
abortion
decision.
the
state
is
not
trying
to
do
any
of
those
things.
the
state
is
merely
trying
to
encourage
within
the
private
sphere
of
action
the
maximum
possible
parental
knowledge
and
participation,
if
that
is
permitted
by
the
doctor.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no,
i
believe
utah
had
requirements
prior
to
1973
that
were
controlled
and
invalidated
by
this
court's
1973
decisions.
mr.
paul
m.
tinker
no.
