justice

in
the
plurality
opinion
in
bellotti
ii
we
said
this
with
respect
to
notice:
"we
conclude
that
every
minor
must
have
the
opportunity
if
she
so
desires
to
go
directly
to
a
court
without
first
consulting
or
notifying
her
parents.
"
how
do
you
construe
that
language,
granted,
of
course,
that
it
is
part
of
a
plurality
opinion?
justice
jr.
there
was
an
alternative
in
massachusetts,
the
court.
no
alternative
in
utah.
