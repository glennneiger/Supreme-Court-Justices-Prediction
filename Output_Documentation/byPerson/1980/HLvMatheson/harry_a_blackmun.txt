justice
blackmun
mr.
dolowitz,
would
you
straighten
me
out?
i
want
to
be
sure
about
this.
on
page
25
of
the
appendix...
do
you
have
it
in
front
of
you?
justice
blackmun
down
just
below
the
middle
there
is
a
question:
"after
talking
the
matter
over
with
a
counselor,
the
counselor
concurred
in
your
decision
that
your
parents
should
be
notified.
"
is
what
it
says.
now,
when
you
read
it,
you
put
a
"not"
in
there.
should
the
"not"
be
in
there?
justice
blackmun
well,
all
i
want
to
know
is,
whether
you
and
opposing
counsel
agree
that
this
is
an
error
in
the
printing
of
the
transcript,
that
the
"not"
is
in
there?
justice
blackmun
mr.
dolowitz,
does
the
record
in
fact
show
whether
she
was
aborted?
justice
blackmun
does
the
statute
refer
to
living
at
home?
justice
blackmun
then
why
are
you
putting
those
words
in
your
description
of
the
statute?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
how
do
we
know
that?
there
are
many
emancipated
minors
even
in
utah,
i
would
assume.
justice
blackmun
the
statute
does
not
refer
to
an
emancipated
minor
or
an
unemancipated
one.
justice
blackmun
i'd
like
to
look
at
the
case
in
the
face
of
your
statute.
justice
blackmun
and
what
does
that
accomplish?
does
that
enable
the
physician
to
exercise
his
best
medical
judgment
a
little
better?
justice
blackmun
and
yet
the
statute
doesn't
go
that
far
with
respect
to
parents
if
the
child
is
married,
even
though
her
husband
is
16.
justice
blackmun
mr.
tinker,
how
old
is
this
utah
statute?
justice
blackmun
was
that
always
true
in
the
state
of
utah
prior
to
1973?
justice
blackmun
so
that
what
you've
just
said
didn't
apply
to
utah
prior
to
roe
against
wade?
