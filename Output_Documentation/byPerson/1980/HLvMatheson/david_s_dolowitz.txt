mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
today
involves
the
validity
of
a
utah
statute
which
provides
that
before
an
abortion
may
be
provided
to
a
minor,
her
parents
must
be
notified
if
it
is
physically
possible
to
do
so.
the
facts
of
the
case
involved
a
15-year-old
minor
who
determined
she
was
in
the
first
trimester
of
an
undesired
pregnancy,
spoke
with
her
social
worker,
determined
that
she
should
terminate
that
pregnancy.
she
determined
further
that
her
parents
should
not
be
involved,
then
consulted
her
treating
physician--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--no.
at
this
point
the
woman
herself
contacted
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
also
had
a
social
worker
working
with
him.
they
consulted
with
her,
determined
with
the
social
workers,
the
physicians,
that
her
parents
should
not
be
notified.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
that
determination
was
made,
mr.
justice
stewart,
by
the
woman,
the
doctor,
and
the
social
worker.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
all
of
them
felt
that
the
parents
should
not
be
involved.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
that
is
in
the
complaint,
and
that
was
part
of
her
testimony
when
she
testified.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
can
only
refer
the
court
to
the
transcript
of--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--yes,
it
was.
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
notice
rather
than
consultation
and
if
i
said
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it's
a
question
of
that
they
should
not
be
given
notice
of
it.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
that's
what
he
told
her
as--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--i
believe
that
is
in
her
testimony.
i
was
looking
at
it.
it
is
definitely
testified
by
her
that
her
counselor...
and
i
am
looking
in
the
pages
24
through
26--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--of
the
appendix,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
she
said
that
she
should
go
ahead
without
notifying--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--i
am
looking
now
at
her
testimony
and
i
am
going
down
page
25:
"question:
you
consulted
with
a
counselor
that
you
were
pregnant,
or
about
the
pregnancy?
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"you
were
living
at
home".
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
oh,
i'm
asking
the
questions
that
she
is
answering;
right.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
if
i
may
say
so,
i
led
her
through
this
very
carefully
and
the
reason
that
i
did
that
is,
she
had
a
highly
unique
fact
situation,
and
as
you
read
through
the
appendix
you
saw
that
this
examination
took
place
after
the
court
had
already
denied
a
preliminary
injunction
and
had
ruled
that
the
peculiar
facts
of
her
circumstances
made
no
difference.
it
was...
the
only
question,
under
the
utah
statute,
the
trial
judge
felt,
was
whether
it
was
physically
possible
to
notify
her.
because
then,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
after
this,
you
see
there's
about
ten
pages
of
colloquy
between
the
court
and--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--in
terms
of
the
record,
it
does
not.
now,
what
happened
there
is
i
forgot
to
ask
her
that
question.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
had
spoken
with
the
doctor
myself
and
the
doctor
told
her
that
and
i
talked
to
her.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
do,
sir,
and
that
is
the
finding.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
the
finding
of
the
court,
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
it
is
not
a...
it
is
a
finding,
i
believe,
and
i
at
this
point
would
have
to
refer
the
trial
court...
or
this
court,
your
honor,
to
the
specific
findings,
conclusions
of
law
and
in
the
findings
that
i'm
referring
to
i
am
looking
at
page
40,
finding
7,
of
the
findings
of
fact,
page
40
of
the
appendix,
where
the
trial
court
made
the
determination
that
she
should
be
aborted
and
that
he
felt...
that's
the
doctor...
that
it
was
not
in
her
best
medical
interest
to
do...
or
was
in
her
best
medical
interest
to
do
so,
but
could
not
and
would
not
perform
an
abortion
on
her
without
informing
her
parents
prior
to
aborting
her
because
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
factually
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
it
would.
but
legally,
in
terms
of
the
position
i'm
taking
today,
i
am
speculating...
i
would
say,
no.
and
the
reason
that
i
would--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--what?
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
no.
i
would
say--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--no.
if
she
has
the
right
of
privacy,
to
go
ahead
on
her
own,
then
she
has
that
right.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
would...
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
i've...
then
i
move
to
speculation
and
i
move
to
it
in
a
very
difficult
area,
and
that
is
the
level
of
maturity
is
such
that
as
a
12-year-old
she
could
be
very
mature,
totally
immature;
though
we're
leaving
something
out,
and
that
is
that
she
is
talking
to
a
doctor
and
says,
i
want
an
abortion.
but
you're
leaving
out
that
the
state
has
already
said,
who
is
going
to
practice
medicine
and
what
are
reasonable
standards?
and
the
physician
is
going
to
say,
i
have
a
right
to
make
a
decision
whether
it's
in
your
best
medical
interest
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
an
action
which
is
in
opposition
to
your
best
medical
interest.
and
if
the
12-year-old
that
you
have
asked
me
about
the
doctor
feels
cannot
rationally
make
that
decision
in
her
own
best
interest,
he--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--i
would
give
you
the
same
answer.
i
think
that
you're
dealing
with
a
doctor
patient
decision
where
the
doctor
who
the
state
has
said
is
licensed
to
practice
medicine
should
be
able
to
deal
with
his
patient,
and
a
minor,
and
deal
without
the
outside
influences;
talk
to
that
patient
and
say,
at
the
end
of
that
discussion,
i'm
not
going
to
do
this
without
your
parents,
i'm
going
to
do
this
with
your
parents.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
there
is
no
law
that
prohibits
it,
but
i
believe
that
most
physicians
would
not
do
it.
but
there
is--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--there
is
a
difference,
though,
and
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
danforth
and
bellotti
ii,
and
a
statute
of
the
state
of
utah
which
states
that
a
minor
of
any
age
can
consent
to
any
treatment
regarding
pregnancy.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
it
should
have
been,
because
if
it
wasn't,
then
i
misspoke
it
at
the
time.
because
it
was
very
clear,
all
the
way
through,
from
the
time
that
she
came
in,
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
counselor,
she
had
spoken
to
her
counselors
and
her
physician
before
she
came
to
me,
and
that
they
all
felt
that
this
was
a
very
unique
situation
and
she
should
not,
her
parents
simply
shouldn't
be
notified.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
now,
your
honor,
what
we
are
dealing
with...
as
you
can
see;
and
i
realize
from
your
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you're
very
concerned
about
the
age
of
the
woman
involved.
the
problem
is
that
i
think
that
utah
has
overstepped
in
doing
that
by
saying
that
a
parent
must
be
notified
in
every
case.
because
just
as
i
answered
to
you
that
the
physician
must
be
involved
in
making
that
decision--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
i
would
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
did
that.
but
if
it
said
that
the
physician...
if
the
words
"if
possible"...
and
this,
in
fact,
is
i
urged
the
utah...
on
the
construction
i
urged
on
the
utah
supreme
court...
the
language,
if
possible,
should
be
construed
to
mean,
"if
medically
appropriate",
that,
if
the
doctor
in
consultation
with
his
patient
feels
that
the
parents
should
be
notified,
consulted,
brought
in,
however
that's
to
be
phrased,
that
would
be
a
rational
statute,
because
it
would
be
reasonable,
it
could
be
done.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
and
that--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--your
honor,
the
answer
i'm
going
to
say
is
that
that
might
have
been
the
intention
and
they
added...
the
utah
supreme
court
said,
if
possible,
within
a
rational
time.
and
the
problem
is,
that
makes
it
very
vague,
as
to
precisely
what
it
means.
and
the
problem
than
then
comes
from
that
is,
if
you
say,
well,
you
know,
if
physically
possible,
like
if
they're
on
a
trip,
if
they're
somewhere
else.
you
still
have
the
same
problem.
but
what
happens
if
they're
on
the
trip?
but
you
have
a
social
worker
or
a
doctor
who
knows
that
family
and
says,
gee,
i'm
glad
they're
on
that
trip;
it
is
best
not
to
notify
them.
so
what
happens
when
they're
in
town
and
he
still
feels
it's
best
not
to
notify
them?
i
can
explain
the
reasons
why
that
is
good.
i
think
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
bellotti
ii
decision
did
a
very
careful
description
of
the
reasons
why
a
parent
should
not
be
notified.
i
think
there's
a
tendency
to
mix
up
the
concept
of
notification
and
consultation,
assuming
that
if
you
notify
the
parents
you're
going
to
bring
them
into
consultation.
but
that
isn't
always
true,
that
you
bring
parents
in,
and
frequently
you
bring
them
in,
and
have
the
result
that
that
will
cause
more
trouble,
if
it's
an
abusive
parent.
if
it's
a
parent
who
for
a
religious
reason
doesn't
agree,
they
will
impose
their
values
on
a
child.
now,
on
that
case,
this
is
the
problem
with
the
statute:
instead
of
being
able
to
respond
to
the
very
particularized
questions
you
asked
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
a
broad,
it's
an
all
inclusive
statute.
it
disregarded
the
concerns
that
this
court
has
stated,
that
in
this
area
a
statute
that's
drawn
should
be
drawn
very
narrowly,
and
very
carefully,
and
consider
the
interests
of
the
minor.
because
you
asked
me
about
a
10-year-old,
a
12-year-old.
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
those
are
some
of
the
circumstances.
but
utah
doesn't
take
any
consideration
into
that.
h.
l....
you
asked
me
when
we
started
about
a
lot
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
there
is
also
another
case
that
was
filed
between
the
decision
of
the
utah
supreme
court
and
the
granting
or
taking
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court
in
this
case.
it
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
utah.
in
that
case
four
women
have
been
granted
injunctions
and
allowed
to
obtain
abortions
by
the
determination
of
the
trial
judge
in
that
case
that
they
were
mature
minors,
handling
their
own
affairs...
one
of
them
had
another
child...
who,
on
their
own,
could
make
the
decision,
and
in
fact
it
would
be
detrimental
to
them
to
have
their
parents
notified.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
three
of
the
four
were;
one
was
still
living
at
home.
and
i've
lodged
the
papers
with
the
clerk's
office
if
the
court
wishes
to
pursue
that
so
that,
the
findings,
the
conclusions,
the
orders,
in
each
of
those
four
cases...
the
first
one
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief.
the
other
three
i've
lodged
with
the
clerk's
office.
now,
in
each
of
those
cases,
they
were
mature
minors
and
it
was,
and
the
trial
judge,
judge
jenkins,
determined
that
it
would
be
detrimental
to
the
parent
child
relationship
to
notify
the
parents,
in
some
cases
because
there'd
been
a
split.
that's
why
the
child
had
left;
things
were
getting
better.
that
would
be
broken
out.
these
are
just
illustrations
as
to
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute.
then
there's
a
second
set
of
problems
that
come
up,
and
that
is
the
doctor
patient
relationship
has
been
invaded
by
this
statute.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
the
relevance,
mr.
justice
stevens,
tends
to
come
from
the
observations
of
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
second
bellotti
decision,
and
that
is
that
as
applied
to
two...
i
will
call
them
categories
of
minors--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--in
this
case
we're
dealing
with
a
subgroup
of
a
minor
where
the
determination
had
been
made
by
the
social
worker
and
the
physician
that
it
was
not
in
her
best
interest,
and
the
trial
court--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--if
i
said
that,
then
that
was
not
what
i
meant.
i
think
the
determination
was
made
by
the
social
workers,
by
the
doctor,
by
the
woman.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
nothing
that
i
read
said
that,
and
that
means
that
when
i
asked
the
questions
in
the
trial,
i
stopped
one
question
too
soon,
because--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--well,
i
realize
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
one
of
the
problems
that
was
going
on
in
this
case
was
that
from
the
prior
determination
of
the
trial
judge
that
the
only
question
that
he
considered
important
is,
was
it
physically
possible
to
locate
the
parents,
meant
that
i
was
conducting
that
hearing
with
her
to
simply
show
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
were
in
fact
correct.
and
then,
when
we
got
into
the
questions,
as
you
see,
mr.
mccarthy
asked
her
the
question
of,
you
know,
do
you
feel
you
can't
discuss
this
with
your
parents?
and
she
said,
"right".
and
he
said,
do
you
feel
you
can't
discuss
other
problems
with
your
parents?
and
she
said
"right".
and
he
said,
what
other
problems?
and
at
that
point
i
objected.
we
went
from
there
around
to
the
question
that
if
the
only
issue,
as
far
as
the
utah
trial
court
was
concerned,
was
was
it
in
her
best
interest,
or
was...
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
that.
was
it
possible
to
physically
locate
her
parents?
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
have
that
she
did
not
want
to
give
notice
to
her
parents.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
believe...
okay;
no.
but
there
was
no
question
in
terms
of
my
representations
to
the
judge,
the
discussion
as
far
as
mr.
tinker
and
mr.
mccarthy
were
concerned
whether
she
could
physically,
her
parents,
could
be
located.
and
i
believe
mr.
mccarthy
asked
her
those
questions
and
she
responded
that
they
could,
that
she
went...
again,
i
think
we're
going
on
just
past
that,
where
mr.
mccarthy
is
asking
the
questions.
he
said,
"are
you
still
living
at
home?
"
"are
you
dependent
on
your
parents?
"
now,
again,
this
may
be
an
error.
i
may
have
been
too
protective
of
her
in
the
trial.
but
there
is
no
question
that
her
parents
could
have
been
readily
notified.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
but
she--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--i
believe
it
is
not.
now,
i...
when
i
answer
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
answer
that
knowing
that
a
number
of
the
members
of
this
court
have
expressed
themselves
in
these
opinions
that
you
believe
that
it
is,
it's
a
wise
policy
to
encourage
the
family
and
to
some
way
get
the
families
together
so
that
that
counseling
occurs,
so
that...
i
say
that
with
some
degree
of
trepidation
when
i
say,
no,
but
i
say
it
with
the
knowledge
that
when
she
is
initially
going
to
someone
who
the
state
of
utah
has
licensed
as
a
physician,
and
said
that,
to
this
regard,
you
have
to
counsel.
so,
in
this
they
weren't
saying
that
there
may
not
be
mandatory
counseling,
in
that
sense.
but
you're
asking
me,
does
the
fact
that
she
had
that
counseling
make
it
any
different
than
if
she
had
just
walked
in
to
the
doctor
and
to
the
constitutional
issue,
i
say,
no,
because
this
state
mandates,
this
statute
mandates
that
in
all
cases.
but
i
say
that
with
the
knowledge
that
you
have,
that
at
least
a
number
of
the
members
of
this
court
feel
that
there
should
be
some
counseling.
and
i
say
that
it
in
fact
exists
because
the
physicians
provide
it.
and
a
physician
is
not
in
a
position
where
he
is
going
to
simply
go
ahead
and
perform
it
without,
that
type
of
counseling
without
knowing
that,
if
you
want
to
call
it
this
way,
his
license
is
at
risk,
his
malpractice
insurance
is
at
risk,
if
he
commits
a
malpractice
or
a
violation
of
a
licensing
statute.
and
in
fact,
that
same
protection
is
insidiously,
i
feel,
undermined
in
this
case
because
it
moves
in
and
if
a
doctor
is
in
a
situation
where
the
minor
who
comes
in
and
they
sit
down,
no
counselor,
no
social
workers
at
all,
and
the
counseling
takes
place
one
to
one
and
the
doctor
says,
you
should
be
aborted,
your
parents
should
not
be
notified,
in
my
best
medical
judgment,
but
i
can't
do
it
because
of
this
statute.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
he
was
not
willing
to
do
it.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
want
you
to
read
that
as
saying
that
he
felt
in
his
best
medical
judgment,
one,
an
abortion
should
be
performed;
secondly,
that
her
parents
should
not
be
notified;
third,
that
he
was
not
willing
to
act
on
his
best
medical
judgment,
which
was
to
abort
her,
without
notifying
her
parents
because
he
was
at
criminal
risk
if
he
did
so--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--do
so.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
what
i
have
just
expressed
to
you
is
what
was
intended
to
go
that
and
if
we
were
not,
between
the
trial
judge
and
counsel
we
were
not
able
to
articulate
it--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--i
drafted
the
findings,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
they
were,
after
dispute.
in
other
words,
the
state
submitted
its
set,
mr.
tinker--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
the
record
does
not
show
that.
what
i
am
trying
to
indicate
to
mr.
justice
white
in
responding
is
that
both
of
us
submitted
the
findings.
then
judge
winter
asked
us
both
to
come
in
and
we
talked,
and
mr.
tinker
and
i
both
communicated
with
him.
and
if
you'll
note,
that
hearing
occurred
in,
i
believe,
april
or
may
and
the
entry
did
not
occur
until,
i
think,
it's
november
or
december.
and
a
big
part
of
that
was
the
question
over
the
findings,
getting
the
transcript
made,
and
going
back
over
the
questions
that
had
been
presented.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
do,
your
honor.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
briefly
as
a
matter
of
history
the
statute
actually
was
adopted
in
'75.
the
statute
adopted
in
'74
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
a
three
judge
federal
court.
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court
and
it
was
dismissed
when
this
statute
was
adopted
in
'75.
it
was
challenged
within
a
few
weeks
of
being
adopted.
the
federal
court
found
it
very
vague
and
abstained.
that
was
appealed
to
the
10th
circuit
who
affirmed
the
abstention
decision.
this
case
was
filed
in
'77
as
a
result.
so
there
has
been
a
series
of
challenges
to
this
spread
out
over
the
years.
then
i
wanted
to
point
out
from
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
stevens
where
they
were
talking
about
the
mature
minor
or
emancipated
minor,
none
of
those
exist
in
the
statute.
this
statute
is,
on
its
face...
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
asked
and
i
didn't
fully
respond
about
emancipation
occurring.
emancipation
in
terms
of
moving
out
of
the
house,
no;
in
terms
of
marriage,
yes.
but
utah
doesn't
have
the
emancipated
minor.
mr.
tinker
gave
his
opinion
but
that
isn't
even
in
the
attorney
general's
office
opinion,
that's
his
personal
opinion
that's
come
about.
and
the
problem
is,
this
statute
says,
"all
minors".
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
that's
a
question
i'm
discussing.
we
do
not
have
a
clear
answer.
the
statute
said
she
gains
her
majority.
but
in
terms
of
the
question
i
was
asked,
what
happens
if
she
is
16,
marries
someone
who
is
16,
and
you
send
notice
to
the
16-year-old
husband,
is
now
acquired.
okay
if
three
weeks
later
they
get
a
divorce,
it's
determined
that
the
marriage
was
a
mistake.
then
it's
not--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--we
don't.
no,
we
don't.
but
the
problem
is
that
this
statute
says,
you
notify
the
parents
in
all
women,
including...
in
this
case
let's
say
there's
that
16-year-old,
if
there
is
a
divorce
and
she
now
suddenly
finds
out
she's
pregnant
three
or
four
weeks
later,
who
do
you
notify?
the
statute
says,
her
parents.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
think,
mr.
justice
burger,
you
do,
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
this
statute
says,
all
parents.
there
is
no
distinction,
and
it
says
it--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--utah
law
doesn't...
utah
law
isn't
clear
on
that
point.
i
can't
give
you
an
answer
on
that.
and
picking
up
on--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--okay.
that's
also
a
problem.
i
will
accept
that.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
think
in
this
case
that
it
must
be
done
in
overbreadth,
because
that's
what
was
done.
and
the
questions
that
you've
asked,
first
me
and
then
mr.
tinker,
have
demonstrated
how
overbroad
the
statute
is.
remember,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
utah
supreme
court
between
the
the
time
this
was
argued
to
judge
winder,
who
had
before
him
only
the
lower
court
decision
in
bellotti,
and
the
utah
supreme
court
decision,
this
court
rendered
its
bellotti
ii
decision
and
that
case
was
argued
by
me
twice
to
the
utah
supreme
court.
because
after
this
court
enunciated
that
decision,
i
filed
a
motion
with
the
utah
supreme
court
for
an
intermediate
injunction
enjoining
the
statute,
and
argued
many
of
the
points
that
we've
covered
today.
they
denied
it,
said
they
would
defer
it,
set
us
on
an
early
calendar.
mr.
tinker
and
i
argued
it
again.
they
had
it,
they
knew
about
the
problems
of
the
mature
minor,
but
they
didn't
exempt
the
mature
minor,
they
didn't,
they
knew
about
the
discussion
in
terms
of
best
interest.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
at
that
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
true.
but
i
had
staring
at
me
a
10th
circuit
decision
saying
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
abstaining
because
the
statute
was
vague,
because
the
utah
supreme
court
hadn't
said
what
that
language
"if
possible"
meant.
and
i
didn't
have
a
ruling
until
when
the
decision
came
out
in
march
of
this
year.
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
had
a
definition
as
to
what
the
statute
was
and
instead
of
doing
that,
further
cases
were
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
because
we
finally
had
an
interpretation
of
what
the
language
"if
possible"
meant.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
i
do
agree
with
mr.
tinker
that
that
would
be
compliance
with
the
statute,
which
is
what
shows
that
despite
its--
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
--because
if
that,
if
the
reason
that
he
did
that
is
that
he
knew,
for
example,
that
the
parents
were
unbalanced
and
she
risked
physical
injury
when
they
found
out,
that
injury
risk
is
still
waiting
for
her
when
she
gets
home,
if
she
gets
home,
or
when
she
next
meets
her
parents,
if
she's
afraid
to
go
home.
they
can
still
hurt
her.
mr.
david
s.
dolowitz
yes.
it
is
still
too
overbroad.
