mr.
dolowitz,
is
that
you
testifying
or
the--
justice
marshall
--well,
all
she
says
is
"yes".
justice
marshall
no
question
that
she's
not
mature,
this
one.
there's
no
question,
is
there?
justice
marshall
yes.
justice
marshall
because
if
she
were
mature,
she
wouldn't
be
included
under
the
statute,
would
she?
justice
marshall
that's
why
i'm
confused
about
this
marriage
and
maturity.
you
used
it
there
but
you
don't
want
to
use
it
here.
i
thought
you
said
it
did
take
her
out
of
the
statute?
i
thought
so
too.
justice
marshall
--i
think
you'd
lose
a
lot
of
weight
when
you
talk
about
divorces.
why
don't
you
talk
about
annulments?
