unknown
speaker
can
we
begin
with
the
proposition
that
the
state
of
kentucky
through
its
legislature
as
a
matter
of
policy
has
said
that
no
one
should
talk
about
this
issue
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
addressing
myself
to,
the
prohibition
against
comments.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
here
that
you're
bringing
to
us
is
not
whether
this
would
be
a
sensible
and
a
sound
thing
to
do
but
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
prophylactic
instruction
be
given
on
request
even
though
the
kentucky
statute
says
it
is
not
to
be?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
statute
say
it
should
not
be
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
what
does
that
mean,
except--
unknown
speaker
--well,
is
your
submission
limited
to
the
fact
situation
here,
or
are
you
urging
as
a
general
proposition
that
upon
request,
upon
request
by
the
defendant,
the
instruction
that
you
sought
and
was
denied
must
be
given?
unknown
speaker
that's
on
the
alternative;
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask,
and
do
you
also
take
the
position
that
if
the
trial
judge
decides
to
give
an
instruction
like
this
without
a
request,
that
you
should
be
at
liberty
to
object?
unknown
speaker
that
was
decided
in
lakeside.
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
understand
why
the
reason
is
of
interest
to
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
fifth
amendment
say
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
does
any
other
law
say
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
then
of
interest
to
us?
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
relevant?
unknown
speaker
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
do
it
for
any
reason
under
the
sun.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
is
the
reason
important?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
truth
by
a
man
not
testifying?
unknown
speaker
i
withdraw
the
question
because
i'm
holding
you
up.
unknown
speaker
if
a
judge
on
his
won
initiative
gave
such
an
instruction,
i
suppose
he
might
be
subject
to
an
objection
that
he
was
calling
attention
to
something
which
the
defendant
wanted
to
avoid?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
rationale
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
mcnally,
i
gather
then
the
argument
you're
now
making
is
largely
a
due
process
argument,
not
a
fifth
amendment
argument,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
are,
but
here,
for
this
purpose,
you're
saying,
due
process
required
this
instruction
in
the
context
of
these
facts.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your
reliance--
unknown
speaker
--your
alternative
is
that
in
any
event
the
fifth
amendment,
in
every
case
where
you
ask
it,
requires
that
the
instruction
be
given.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
jurors
were
always
familiar
with
the
precise
state
of
the
legislation
in
the
state
as
pre-1915
or
post-1915,
that
the
defendant
was
not
allowed
to
testify
or
he
was
allowed
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
was
there
anything
to
prevent
in
those
days
defense
counsel
from
telling
the
juror
that
even
if
the
court
or
the
judge
didn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcnally,
if
you're
right...
compelled
on
request
the
giving
of
this
instruction,
why
doesn't
the
fifth
amendment
also
require
the
giving
of
the
instruction
whether
or
not
a
request
is
made?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
not.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
we're
looking
down
the
road.
unknown
speaker
my
hypothetical
is
a
case
in
which
no
request
is
made.
indeed,
it's
not
made
because
counsel
would,
thinks
it
would
not
be
helpful
and
perhaps
might
be
harmful
to
the
accused.
but
nevertheless,
if
it
must
be
given
on
request,
because
the
fifth
amendment
requires
it,
why
must
it
not
be
given
just
as
a
matter
of
course?
unknown
speaker
if
he
doesn't
request
it,
it
is
to
be
treated
as
if
he
waived
it,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
an
intelligent
waiver.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
it
be
an
intelligent
waiver
if
it
wasn't
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
the
reason
for
no
request
may
be
more
than
a
waiver,
it
may
be
an
affirmative
reason
as,
by
the
reasoning
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
lakeside.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
tactics.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
in
part
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
agreed
with
the
reasoning
of
defense
counsel.
does
that
make
it
great?
unknown
speaker
dissenting.
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me,
do
the
counsel
in
kentucky
argue
before
or
after
the
judge
instructs?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
try
to
get
him
to
join
you?
unknown
speaker
trial
counsel
did
suggest
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
wasn't
required
to
take
the
stand--
unknown
speaker
--and
that...
now,
doesn't
that
bear
on
your
due
process
argument?
the
prosecutor
didn't
say
to
the
contrary.
and
the
judge
certainly
didn't
indicate
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
i
only
made
one.
unknown
speaker
but,
in
kentucky,
i
take
it,
that
counsel
can
tell
a
jury
what
he
thinks
the
law
is,
even
though
the
judge
hasn't
instructed
on
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
just
did,
this
counsel
did.
unknown
speaker
i
just
bring
it
up
because
it
does
bear
on
your
due
process
argument
in
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
and
if
your
get
away
from
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
then
the
question
is
simply
the
one
reserved
in
griffin,
i
take
it?
whether,
in
every
case,
regardless
of
the
factual
setting
or
anything
else,
an
accused
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
his
silence
need
not
be
considered,
if
he
requests
such
an
instruction?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
explicitly
left
open
in
the
griffin
case,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
state's
decided
that
the
instruction
about
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
was
so
basic,
so
fundamental
to
the
whole
proceeding,
that
it
required
that
before
any
evidence
was
received
the
judge
give
the
certain
general
instruction
explaining
both,
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
before
any
evidence;
and
would
explain
it,
as
a
good
many
judges
do
now,
in
both
federal
and
state
courts,
on
the
theory
that
then
the
jury
will
better
understand
the
evidence
as
it
comes
in,
and
they
will
not
be
sitting
around
for
two
or
three
days
wondering
what
the
defendant
is
going
to
say
in
answer
to
these
charges.
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
one
question.
you've
said
several
times
that
you
think
the
lakeside
case
helps
you.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
you
think
it
helps
you.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it's
neutral,
but
you
seem
to
think
it
helped
you.
unknown
speaker
also,
the
definition
of
that
word
comment
in
lakeside
helps
you,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
how
does
this,
counsel,
how
does
this
bear
on
the
issue
that's
presented
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
are
you
suggesting
a
harmless
error
argument?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
telling
us
now
is
harmless
error
argument?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
have
you
read
brewer
v.
williams?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
that
easily
have
been
solved
by
giving
the
instruction,
if
he
was
so
guilty?
why
didn't
you
give
the
instruction?
why
didn't
you
object
to
it
if
he
was
so
guilty?
unknown
speaker
it
had
no
option.
unknown
speaker
then
they
would
have
had
to
do
it
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent,
wouldn't
they?
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
they
have
to
take
the
same
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
are
the
facts
of
interest
to
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
constitutional
issue
the
only
issue
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
we
took
the
case
to
decide
a
harmless
error
question?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
suggesting
kentucky
is
kind
of
a
lean
instruction
state
where
the
preference
within
constitutional
limits,
not
just
on
this
particular
kind
of
a
charge
but
on
any
charge,
is
that
you
just
don't
charge
the
jury
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
is
that
parameters
or
perimeters?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
that
knowing
in
advance
what
kind
of
instruction
the
judge
would
give
one
way
or
the
other
would
have
any
influence
on
his
decision?
unknown
speaker
then
aren't
you
admitting
that
there
is
some
compulsion,
if
there's
no
instruction
when
he
wants
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
that
the
fact
the
judge
is
not
going
to
give
the
instruction
may
influence
him
not
to
testify,
then
isn't
that
a
factor
that
may
tend
to
compel
him
not
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
has
a
rule
that
the
judge
can't
give
this
kind
of
instruction.
that
rule,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
just
suggested,
does
have
an
impact
on
his
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
it
is
not
a
form
of
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
imagine
a
jury
would
think,
other
than
that
the
man
is
guilty?
unknown
speaker
so
they're
not,
they
wouldn't
think
anything
of
it?
unknown
speaker
they
may
not
notice
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
me
to
assume
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
throughout
the
jury
proceedings
not
one
of
the
12
will
mention
the
fact
that
he
didn't
take
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
possibility
that
that
will
not
happen?
unknown
speaker
you
said
originally
that
you
could
assume
that
nobody
noticed
it.
am
i
to
assume
that
not
one
of
the
12
noticed
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
hasn't
the
deviation
by
the
kentucky
court
been
on
the
construction
of
the
meaning
of
the
kentucky
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
the
no
comment
rule
means?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
kentucky
court
has
not
been
completely
consistent
about
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
that's
the
present
law?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
that
the
statute
means
that
this
instruction
must
not
be
given?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
present
law
of
kentucky,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
law
is
that
no
one
would
comment,
what
about
the
defendant's
own
lawyer
explaining
to
the
jury
that
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
privilege,
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
i
know
he
made
it,
but
your
adversary
indicated
that
he
did
it
illegally.
unknown
speaker
so
your
view
is
that
even
his
own
lawyer
in
kentucky
is
not
permitted
to?
unknown
speaker
would
the
question
arise
in
the
case
where
a
guilty
verdict
is
returned?
who
is
there
to
complain
about
it,
then,
if
there's
no
appeal?
the
problem
is
academic
then,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
on
lakeside
v.
oregon?
do
you
think
that
case
helps
you
or
hurts
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
does
that
follow?
because,
isn't
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
by
its
very
nature
something
that
is
up
to
the
defendant
either
to
exercise
his
right
not
to
testify
or
to
testify?
that's
the
whole
theory
of
it,
that
the
option
is
the
defendant's.
unknown
speaker
that
was
under
a
specific
federal
statute
though,
wasn't
it?
