mr.
robert
v.
bullock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
in
this
case
point
overwhelmingly
to
the
guilt
of
the
petitioner,
in
this
particular
instance.
if
you
will
recall,
officer
ellison
was
driving
her
cruiser
down
the
street,
saw
an
alley,
looked
in
the
alley
and
saw
something
suspicious.
she
backed
up,
shined
her
light
down
the
alley,
saw
two
individuals
crouched.
they
took
off
running,
she
went
down
the
alley
and
saw
that
there
was
a
hole
in
the
side
of
young's
hardware
store.
she
gave
out
a
call
on
her
police
radio
for
officer
davis
who
was
in
the
vicinity.
he
saw
petitioner
running
down
an
alley;
he
gave
chase.
they
apparently
ran
parallel
for
a
period
of
time,
at
which
time
officer
davis
cut
across
and
almost
ran
into
the
petitioner.
when
officer
ellison
saw
him,
saw
the
individual
at
the
hardware
store,
he
was
carrying
a
gym
bag,
what
she
described
as
a
gym
bag.
he
had
on
distinctive
looking
clothing,
sort
of
orange
pants,
and
so
forth.
he
was
apprehended
by
officer
davis--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
--i
believe
two-fold,
your
honor.
if
it
please
the
court,
first,
i
would
think
the
court
would
be
reluctant
to
reverse
any
case
on
which
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt.
and
second--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
--we
have
in
our
brief;
yes.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that
position.
the
second
issue,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
it
would
appear
to
us
that
there
was
very
little
likelihood
under
any
circumstances
that
the
defendant
in
this
particular
case
would
have
taken
the
stand.
as
such,
we
are
suggesting
that
this
in
effect
may
be
a
manufactured
type
constitutional
issue,
because
the
facts
were
so
overwhelming.
it
would
be
very
unlikely
for
any
defense
counsel
to
recommend
to
his
client
that
the
would
take
the
stand.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
why
wasn't
it
objected
to?
the
lower
court
in
kentucky
was
bound
in
effect
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
in
its
decision
in
green
v.
commonwealth.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
basically
true.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
right.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
the
point,
i
guess,
i
was
pointing
to,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that
this
was
a
foregone
conclusion
and
in
effect
the
constitutional
issue
itself
was
manufactured
because
they
knew
that
he
wasn't
going
to
be
able
to
take
the
stand
in
a
case
like
this.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well,
there's
two
constitutional
issues
according
to
my
brother,
mr.
mcnally.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
to
find
a
fifth
amendment
violation
in
this
particular
case,
there
must
be
a
finding
of
compulsion
under
the
fifth
amendment
cases.
we
would
agree
that
there
is
a
difference
in
some
of
the
cases
which
indicate,
the
trilogy
of
cases,
bruno,
griffin,
and
lakeside,
which
indicate
maybe
a
preference
for
this
type
of
an
instruction.
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky,
as
you've
noted,
does
not
believe
that
the
instruction
should
be
given,
and
in
fact
they
have
stated
on
numerous
occasions
that
they
believe
it
does
more
harm
than
good.
on
the
other
hand,
as
we've
noted,
there
is
some
indication
that
this
court
would
prefer
the
instruction.
as
has
been
pointed
out
many
times
by
the
court,
differences
or
incongruity
within
the
limits
of
fundamental
fairness
is
at
the
heart
of
our
federal
systems.
the
formulation
of
procedural
rules
to
govern
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
various
states
is
properly
a
matter
of
local
concern.
of
course,
that's
always
subject
to
the
parameters
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
well,
that
has
been
stated
in
at
least
one
kentucky
case,
but
the
state...
my
point
is,
the
state
of
kentucky
can
be
different,
if
it
chooses
to
be,
as
long
as
it
falls
within
the
parameters
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
thought
it
was
parameters.
maybe
it's
perimeters.
in
discussing
compulsion...
and
this
court
has
looked
at
cases
similar
to
this,
but,
this
issue...
the
defendant
in
this
case
did
not
testify.
we
suggested
why
he
probably
did
not
testify.
but
since
he
did
not
testify,
there
was
in
fact
no
compulsion
to
testify
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
procedures
that
were
used
were
the
normal
procedures
of
a
trial,
such
as
required
for
a
decision
on
the
defendant's
part.
he
has
to
decide
in
a
case
like
that
whether
he
wants
to
testify
or
not
to
testify,
and
this
is
the
normal
state
of
trial
procedure,
it
is
not
compulsion
by
the
state
of
kentucky
in
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
it
might.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
but,
sir,
this
is
not
a
compulsion
by
the
state
of
kentucky.
this
is
the
normal
trial
situation
as
opposed
to
something
that
the
state
has
compelled
upon
the
defendant.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes.
the
court--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
--well,
the
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
it's
not
a
form
of
compulsion
for
a
defendant
to
have
to
make
hard
choices
in
the
case,
such
as,
the
court
has
held
that
when
an
individual
decides
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
his
own
defense,
there
can
be
cross-examination,
and
cross
examination
as
to
the
guilt
on
that
particular
case.
and
that's
not
considered
compulsion.
likewise,
the
court
in
a
single
verdict
death
penalty
case
has
said,
even
though
a
man
may
have
to
plead
for
his
life,
his
very
life,
the
fact
that
if
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
may
be
cross-examined,
this
is
not
considered
compulsion;
mcgautha
case.
the
supposition
that
a
failure
of
a
particular
defendant
to
testify
is
a
supposition,
it's
not
a
proven
fact
as
such.
no
one
knows
what
an
individual
jury
will
think
or
will
not
think.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i
think
that
they
may
well
not
notice
at
all.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
they
may
not
notice
at
all,
or
discuss
it.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
in...
that's
been
part
of
the
supposition
of
the
kentucky
courts
on
this
particular
issue.
but
there
is
an
additional
part
of
the
instruction
in
this
particular
case,
if
you
will
recall.
the
court
in
this
case
instructed
that
the
jury
shall
consider
the
evidence
alone
and
in
arriving
at
its
decision
on
guilt
or
innocence,
the
failure
to
testify
is
obviously
not
evidence,
and
its
consideration
would
have
violated
the
court's
instruction.
therefore--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
--certainly.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that
there
is
a
possibility?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
would
you
rephrase
it,
please?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
in
a
given
case?
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
there
could
be
such
a
case;
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
we
would
take
the
position
that
to
reverse
this
particular
case
on
the
no
inference
instruction
would
stretch
the
constitutional
principles
behind
the
fifth
amendment
in
an
unprecedented
manner
and
would
in
effect
give
an
inequitable
result.
neither
the
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendments
cause
a
penalty,
since
the
court
has
created
no
undue
or
additional
pressure
upon
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand.
any
of
the
consequences
of
the
silence
are
defendant's
choice,
a
part
of
trial
tactics
and
not
caused
by
the
courts
or
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
if
we
may,
let
me
draw
an
analogy
between
this
and
the
situation
in
taylor
v.
kentucky
and
kentucky
v.
wharton.
in
those
two
court
cases,
this
court
held
that
under
certain
factual
patterns
where
the
evidence
was
not
overwhelming,
there
may
be
a
totality
of
circumstances
that
constitutionally
require
a
presumption
of
innocence
instruction
in
that
case.
the
court
in
wharton,
however,
pointed
out
that
there
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction.
in
wharton
it
was
held
there
was
no
such
right
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
instruction.
we
feel
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
to
give
the
no
inference
instruction.
the
two
types
of
instructions
are
somewhat
similar.
it
has
been
attacked
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
or
it
has
been
stated
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
that
the
state
of
kentucky
has
not
been
consistent,
has
waffled
back
and
forth
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
best
to
give
the
no
inference
instruction.
just
to
briefly
respond,
the
kentucky
court
has
consistently
maintained
that
no
inference
instruction
is
not
in
the
best
interests
of
an
accused.
however,
in
one
case,
at
least,
it
by
dicta
said
that
the
instruction
under
those
circumstances
might
have
been
allowed.
it
was
later
repudiated.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
correct;
yes.
at
first
it
says
that
no
one
may
comment
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that
is
the
present
law,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
this
instruction
must
not
be
given.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
he
made
that,
and
in
this
particular--
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
--yes.
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
that's
what
case
law
in
kentucky
says;
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
sir.
my
brother,
mr.
mcnally,
has
gone
through
a
tremendous
task
of
trying
to
catalog
the
various
states
as
to
their
holdings
on
the
no
inference
instruction.
we
do
not
specifically
disagree
as
to
each
of
these
cases
in
our
brief.
the
reason
is
that
it
would
have
caused
a
brief
in
and
of
itself.
we
would
point
out
that
there
is
room
for
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
holding
of
the
various
states,
and
it
would
be
our
position,
more
importantly,
that
it
really
isn't
germane
in
and
of
itself,
since
conceivably
there
could
be
49
states
that
require
the
no
inference
instruction
and
kentucky
be
the
lone
state
the
other
way.
but
as
long
as
there
was
no
constitutional
violation,
kentucky
would
be
within
its
rights
as
a
separate
state.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
received
a
fair
trial.
one
of
the
questions
earlier
was
whether
a
judge
could
explain
various
rights
during
a
voir
dire.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
defendant's
rights
were
explained
to
the
jury.
it
was
stated
that
he
was
presumed
by
the
law
to
be
innocent.
the
judge
took
great
pains
to
explain
and
make
sure
that
there
was
a
fair
trial
during
the
voir
dire.
and,
as
i
mentioned,
there
was
an
instruction
that
they
could
find
the
defendant
guilty
only
from
the
evidence
alone.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
we
think
it
helps
us.
the
gist
of
it
as
far
as
we
can
see
is
that
it
may
be
wise
for
a
trial
judge
not
to
give
such
a
cautionary
instruction
over
a
defendant's
objection
and
each
state
is,
of
course,
free
to
forbid
its
trial
judges
from
doing
so
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
if
they
can
forbid
them
from
giving
the
instruction
over
the
objection
of
counsel,
we
feel
that
they
should
likewise
be
able
to
forbid
the
instruction,
period.
mr.
robert
v.
bullock
yes,
but
there
must
in
that
case
be
some
compulsion.
and
in
this
case
there
was
no
compulsion.
in
conclusion,
we
would
suggest
that
constitutional
rights
must
be
jealously
guarded
and
the
constitution
must
be
looked
at
in
behalf
of
the
defendant.
but
the
public,
likewise,
must
be
safe
and
secure
with
the
knowledge
that
the
perpetrators
of
crime
will
be
punished
if
they're
guilty.
constitutional
grounds
for
reversal
should
not
be
manufactured
or
decided
on
tenuous
or
speculative
grounds.
in
this
case
it
is
our
position
there
is
neither
a
fifth
nor
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
of
law.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will--
