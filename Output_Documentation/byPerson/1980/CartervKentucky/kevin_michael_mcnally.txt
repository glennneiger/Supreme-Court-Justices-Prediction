mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
here
from
hopkinsville,
kentucky,
after
petitioner
was
convicted
of
third
degree
burglary
and
persistent
felony
offender
in
the
first
degree,
and
was
sentenced
to
20
years.
the
issue
that
this
case
brings
here
today
was
presented
to
the
kentucky
supreme
court
which
affirmed
mr.
carter's
conviction.
the
issue
is
whether,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
united
states
constitution,
a
protective
or
prophylactic
instruction
must
be
given
upon
the
defendant's
request
regarding
the
defendant's
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
the
kentucky
legislature
as
did
most
states
passed
a
statute
permitting
the
defendant
to
testify
and
stating
that
no
comment
shall
be
made.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
the
instruction
itself
does
not
specifically
address
the
issue
of
a
protective
instruction.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
interpreted
that
statute
to
mean
that
no
comments
at
all
may
be
permitted
regarding
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
i
must
disagree
on
one
minor
point
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
statute
doesn't
address
the
issue
of
instruction
and
the
kentucky
court
has
held,
taken
conflicting
positions
on
that
point.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
it
says
no
comments
shall
be
made.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
as
this
court
indicated
in
lakeside,
what
the
prohibition
in
griffin,
for
example,
was
that
no
adverse
comment
shall
be
made.
and
that
would
be,
we
think,
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
we
do
not
bring
here
a
question
of
state
interpretation.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
this
is
not
a
case
of
what
is
the
most
desirable
rule,
although
our
position
is,
we
submit,
by
light
of
the
vast
majority
of
authorities,
the
most
desirable
rule.
the
question
here
is,
as
referred
to
in
cupp
v.
naughten,
what
exactly
does
the
constitution
specifically
require?
and
that's
what
makes
this
case
different
from
any
other
alleged
instructional
error.
we
want
to
indicate
right
at
the
outset
our
sensitivity
to
the
undercurrent
in
the
commonwealth's
brief
that
somehow
we're
asking
this
court
to
be
a
sort
of
author
for
kentucky
form
instructions.
again
what
makes
this
case
different
is
the
basic,
fundamental
nature
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
takes
it
out
of
the
realm
of
all
other,
we
think,
alleged
instructional
errors
that
might
be
presented
to
this
court
at
various
times.
we
present
two
analyses
for
the
court's
considerations,
the
first
finding
its
genesis
in
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
itself,
the
second
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
while,
of
course,
these
themes
are
interrelated,
for
a
logical
analysis
we
have
discussed
them
separately
in
our
brief
and
will
do
so
in
this
argument,
if
the
court
permits.
we
have
no
intention
of
dwelling
on
the
facts
of
this
case
but
there
are
two
principal
factual
themes
we
would
like
to
emphasize.
what
they
do
is
dramatize
legal
principles
which
perhaps
in
another
case
we
might
be
arguing
in
the
abstract.
the
first
of
those
is
what
we
would
call
the
"roar"
of
the
defendant's
silence
at
trial.
there
was
a
continuing
theme
throughout
this
trial
that
the
defendant
refused
to
explain
himself
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings.
he
refused
to
explain
himself
to
the
police,
and
this
was
testified
to
by
two
police
officers
at
trial;
was
repeatedly
emphasized
by
the
prosecutor's
questions;
and
even
a
waiver
form
was
introduced
in
which,
on
the
bottom
of
it
in
big
back
letters
was
written,
"defendant
refuses
to
answer
questions"
or
something...
i'm
paraphrasing.
not
only
was
there
mention
during
the
testimony
regarding
the
defendant's
refusal
to
give
his
reasons
why
he
was
admittedly
arrested
under
incriminating
circumstances,
but
the
prosecution's
arguments
to
a
subtle
extent,
we
will
admit,
but
the
prosecution's
arguments
certainly
brought
that
to
the
attention
of
the
jury.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
that
is
our
alternative
contention.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
in
the
alternative.
of
course,
our
primary
reliance
is
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
however,
would
we
not
have
these,
what
i
would
call,
illustrative
facts
in
this
case,
of
the
legal
principles,
we
would
still
be
making
the
same
arguments.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
that
would
depend
on
the
individual
state
procedure.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
that
was
the
issue
decided
in
lakeside,
and
we
certainly
don't
question
lakeside.
it's
one
of
the
primary
authorities
upon
which
we
rely.
the
other
facts
at
trial
which
emphasize
the
defendant's
refusal
to
testify
or
explain
himself
were...
even
the
defense
argued,
for
example.
defense
counsel
attempted
to
deal
with
this
issue
as
best
he
could
without
the
protection
of
the
trial
court,
and
the
only
way
he
apparently
thought
he
could
do
that
was
to
mention
the
fact,
what
was,
in
fact...
it
was
obvious
to
the
jury
and
everyone
else
in
the
courtroom...
and
state
that
the
defendant
had
the
right
not
to
testify.
he
stated
that,
in
fact,
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
now,
while
that
is
constitutionally
accurate,
we
submit
that
it
may
have
been
perceived
as
either
inaccurate
by
the
jury
or
perhaps
even
arrogance
on
the
part
of
defense
counsel.
this
illustrates
why
we
need
the
court's
protection.
there
is
no
effective
way
a
trial
lawyer
can
deal
with
this
issue,
at
least
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
other
than
in
instruction
from
the
court.
for
example,
he
couldn't
tell
the
jury,
even
if
that
were
permitted,
why
the
defendant
did
not
testify,
for
to
do
so,
would
bring
about
the
exact
evil
he
was
trying
to
avoid.
the
other
illustrative
factual
theme
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
in
this
case,
we
submit
the
record
demonstrates
that
he
did
not,
he
declined
to
testify
for
reasons
which
were
neutral
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
defense
counsel
made
it
clear
that
in
an
in-chambers
hearing
that
possibly
the
only
reason
defense...
i'm
sorry...
the
only
reservation
he
had
regarding
testimony
was
his
fear
of
impeachment.
i
don't
think
that
any
reasonable
reading
of
the
record
would
give
rise
to
the
challenge
that
the
commonwealth
makes
that
impeachment
was
not
the
reason
why
he
did
not
testify.
and
indeed,
in
the
court
below
the
commonwealth
admitted
in
their
brief
that
"most
definitely
the
impeachment
influenced
the
appellant
in
his
decision
not
to
take
the
stand.
"
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
merely
because
it
illustrates,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
point
that
has
been
made
in
perhaps
the
abstract
in
other
cases,
that
there
are
neutral
reasons
why
a
defendant
would
decide
not
to
testify
at
trial.
it
is
illustrative,
it
is
not
necessary.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
no,
it
doesn't,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
no,
it
doesn't,
and--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--it's
relevant
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue
which
we
are
also
raising.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
it's
relevant
because
the
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--under
the
fifth
amendment,
absolutely,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
because
this
court's
interest
and
concern
in
due
process
analysis
has
been
the
truth-seeking
function,
and
we
submit
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
the
jury--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--the
point
we
are
trying
to
make,
mr.
justice
marshall,
is
that
the
jury
naturally
and
we
think--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--concluded
that...
well,
i
think
it's
an
important
question.
the
jury
concluded
that
the
defendant
didn't
testify
as
jurors
often
will
because
he
was
guilty,
and
in
fact
that
was
not
the
case.
in
that
sense,
under
a
due
process
analysis,
a
protective
instruction
is
necessary
because
it
is
relevant
to
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial,
and
in
that
sense
this
fact
is
relevant.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
conceivably.
that
was
the
issue
in
lakeside,
and
the
issue
that
was--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice?
is
that
the
rationale
of
that
side
of
it?
we
frankly...
frankly,
we
disagree
with
the
argument
that
a
defendant
in
some
cases
will
not
notice,
the
jury
will
not
notice
that
a
defendant
does
not
testify.
however,
that
is
not
essential
to
this
particular
case
and
again,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
lakeside
was
wrongly
decided.
indeed,
we
put
great
reliance
on
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
lakeside.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
we're
making
both,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
exactly
our
position.
and
i'll
explain
why
that
is
if
i
may.
now,
we
differ
with
the
commonwealth's
suggestion
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
expand
the
parameters
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
we
think
that
our
position
can
withstand
an
historical
analysis,
and
we
think
that
for
these
reasons.
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
fifth
amendment
a
defendant
was
not
permitted
to
testify.
this
was,
as
this
court
recognized
in
wilson
v.
united
states,
considered
a
protection
for
him.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
feeling
at
the
time
that
a
defendant
if
he
were
permitted
to
testify
would
be
under
some
form
of
compulsion
to
do
so
lest
the
jury
take
an
adverse
inference
against
him.
in
approximately
1878
congress,
as
did
many
states,
passed
statutes
permitting
defendants
to
testify.
once
they
did
so,
we
think
that
a...
the
jury,
naturally,
will
take
an
adverse
inference
against
a
defendant
who
declines
to
exercise
that
privilege.
since
at
the
time
of
adoption
of
the
fifth
amendment
the
defendant
was
not
permitted
to
testify,
he
was
not
expected
to
do
so.
now,
he
is.
and
in
that
sense
we
request
a
protective
instruction
under
the
fifth
amendment
so
that
this
court
can
restore
the
original
balance.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
tip
the
balance
in
the
favor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
i
have
never
read
a
trial
transcript
from
1850,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
conclude
that
jurors
at
that
time
knew
that
the
defendant
was
not
permitted
to
testify.
now,
whether
counsel
told
them
that
or
whether
they
knew
it
from
being
intelligent
and
civic-minded
citizens,
i
don't
know,
but
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
conclusion.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
also
submit
that
our
fifth
amendment
analysis
finds
great
support
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
in
wilson
v.
united
states,
this
court
first
held
that
comment,
adverse
comment
was
prohibited.
it
did
so
under
a
federal
statue
and
not
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
bruno
v.
united
states
shortly
thereafter
this
court
dealt
with
the
exact
issue
presented
here
and
ruled,
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
but
pursuant
to
the
federal
statute,
that
an
instruction
was
required.
an
unanimous
court
decided
that.
subsequently,
in
malloy
v.
hogan,
this
court
held
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
immediately
after
that
the
court
dealt
with
the
issue
presented
in
wilson
in
griffin
v.
california.
and
the
court
stated
at
that
time
that
the
federal
statute
while
obviously
not
constitutional
in
nature
is
merely
an
enactment
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
court
suggested
that
you
could
substitute
the
words
fifth
amendment
for
the
word
act
and
the
spirit
of
the
self-incrimination
privilege
would
be
captured.
we
submit
that
as
wilson
was
translated
into
the
holding
in
griffin,
so
bruno
must
be
translated
into
the
result
we
seek
here.
in
malloy
v.
hogan
this
court
rejected
the
argument
that
somehow
a
watered-down
version
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
should
be
applied
to
the
states.
we
submit
that
that
same
analysis
produces
the
result
that
we
seek
in
this
case.
another
fifth
amendment
point
that
we
would
like
to
address
ourselves
to
is
the
penalty
theory,
if
you
will,
of
griffin.
the
court
might
ask,
where
is
the
compulsion
in
this
case?
where
is
the
penalty
extracted?
well,
the
penalty
that
we
identify
in
this
record,
and
indeed
in
any
case
where
a
defendant
doesn't
testify,
is
the
unchecked
speculation,
if
i
could
use
the
words
of
the
dissenters
in
griffin,
what
the
jury
will
do
in
regard
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
that
is,
we
think
a
constitutionally
significant
form
of
compulsion...
and
in
that
sense,
this
case
fits
within
the
griffin
analysis...
and
indeed,
we
would
submit,
as
the
court
may
recall,
in
griffin
there
was
certain
protective
comments
by
the
california
trial
judge.
he
indeed
told
that
jury
that
the
defendant
in
fact
had
a
constitutional
right
not
to
testify.
he
also
permitted
them
to
take
adverse
inference
from
the
failure,
and
the
prosecutor
also
commented,
but
in
the
sense
that
a
protective
instruction
was
given
in
griffin,
this
case
is
even
more
dramatically
illustrative
of
a
penalty
extracted
for
exercise
of
the
privilege.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
that
issue
is
not
presented--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
there
is
a
countervailing
legitimate,
we
think,
state
interest
in
the
situation
that
you
refer
to,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
that
is
the
requirement
that
issues
be
first
presented
to
a
trial
judge
so
that
he
may
rule
upon,
he
may
in
fact,
give
an
instruction
upon
request.
therefore,
the
whole
issue
is
eliminated.
that
distinction
is
a
very
important--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--well,
this
court
has
held
in
cases
such
as
wainwright
v.
sykes,
for
example,
that
trial
counsel
can
waive
issues
of
federal
constitutional
negligence.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
that
would
be
our
position,
although
that
is
again
not
presented--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--it
may
be
under
the
facts--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--well,
it
may
be
a
tactical
waiver.
whether
it's
intelligent
or
not,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we'd
have
to
examine
the
particular
case.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
if
trial
counsel
waives
his
right
to
this
instruction?
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
as
defense
counsel
in
lakeside
did
exactly
that.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
we
would
like
to
turn,
if
the
court
permits--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--once
again
to
our
fourteenth
amendment
analysis
and
make
some--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--the
counsel
argues
after
the
judge
instructs,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
i
did
not,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
he
did.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
we
would
disagree
on
a
few
points,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
we
would
disagree
on
your
general
point
to
the
extent
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
take
any
advantage
or
did
not
denigrate
the
particular
right;
to
that
extent.
secondly,
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
taylor
v.
kentucky
that
while
counsel's
arguments
may
be
relevant
in
the
overall
due
process
analysis,
counsel's
instructions
are
not
a...
i'm
sorry...
counsel's
arguments
are
not
a
substitute
for
the
court's
instructions.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
i
don't
believe
that's
the
law
of
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
he
did
it
in
contravention
of
kentucky
law
and
he
got
away
with
it
without
objection
from
the
prosecutor.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
may
answer
your
question.
the
reason
why
he
got
away
with
it
is--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--i
would
agree
that
it's
relevant,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
reason
why
there
was
no
objection
by
the
prosecutor
is
that
defense
counsel
simply
can't
deal
with
the
issue
and
he
may
have
been
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
hurting
himself.
because
without
the
support
of
the
trial
judge
his
statement
of
the
law
may
be
dismissed
as
either
inaccurate,
as
we
mentioned
before,
or
just
simply
arrogant,
stating
that
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
do
anything,
may
not
have
sat
well
with
the
jury.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
we
think
that
issue,
the
per
se
rule,
if
you
will,
that's
presented
in
this
case...
we
argued
it
below
and
it's
well
presented...
the
court
may
not
choose
to
reach
that,
but
we
think
it
is
framed
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
i
believe
that
also
was
mentioned
in
lakeside,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
before
any
evidence
is
received?
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
that
the
due
process
clause
goes
to
the
timing
of
a
particular
instruction.
i
think
any
petitioner
would
have
to
be
satisfied
if
the
court
instructs
the
jury,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
timing
of
that
particular
instruction
would
be
an
issue
of
constitutional
magnitude.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
just
a
few
points
in
terms
of
a
due
process
analysis,
again,
number
one,
this
instruction
deals
with
a
specific
constitutional
right.
number
two,
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
defendant's
testimony
is
expected,
even
in
a
case
that
doesn't
present
the
facts
that
we
have
here.
number
three,
instructions
do
work,
and
it's
basically
a
pillar
of
our
criminal
justice
system.
instructions
are
effective,
and
this
court
recognized
that,
of
course,
in
lakeside.
number
four,
silence
is
ambiguous.
again,
if
you
take
away
the
facts
of
this
case,
silence,
as
this
court
noted
in
doyle
v.
ohio,
pretrial
is
ambiguous;
it
is
even
more
so
at
trial,
insolubly
ambiguous.
again,
the
truth-seeking
function
is
undermined
because
there
may
be
reasons
why
a
defendant
such
as
mr.
carter
declines
to
testify,
unrelated
to
guilt
or
innocence.
and
the
final
two
points
are
that,
while
it's
not
dispositive
of
the
due
process
issue
presented,
we
find
widespread
support
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
jurisdictions.
our
research
has
only
disclosed
three,
or
perhaps
four,
jurisdictions
that
don't
give
this
instruction
upon
request.
and
finally,
the
last
criterion
is
that
state
interest.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
examine
what
important
state
interest
is
at
stake
here?
the
only
articulated
interest
in
the
commonwealth's
brief
is
that
the
instruction
should
be
prohibited
in
the
defendant's
own
interest,
and
we
submit
that
the
commonwealth
stating
that
it's
in
the
defendant's
interest
not
to
get
a
protective
instruction
is
not
the
kind
of
basic
exercise
of
a
state's
jurisdiction
which
need
be
given
due...
perhaps
it
needs
to
be
given
due
deference
but
not
undue
deference
in
any
fourteenth
amendment
analysis.
and
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
will
reserve--
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
--well,
the
holding
of
it
is
really
neutral
on
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
well,
what
i
was
referring
to
was
the
language,
and
specifically
on
two
points:
the
first
being
that
juries
will
notice
a
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
even
if
in
that
case
defense
counsel
takes
great
pains
to
avoid
any
mention
of
the
issue.
we
think
that
is
a
significant
point
in
this
case.
and
the
second
point
being
that
protective
instructions
are
effective.
there
was
language
in
the
majority
opinion
which
addressed
itself
to
those
two,
and
we
think
they
are
important
considerations
for
our
due
process
analysis.
to
that
extent.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
again,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
agree.
we'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
just
a
few
points,
if
i
may.
i'd
just
like
to
address
ourselves
briefly
to
the
question
of
harmless
error
since
we
didn't
originally
address
that.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
presented
below,
and
after
the
discussion
this
morning,
it's
clear
to
me
it's
not
jurisdictional
but
we
think
that
there
are
good
reasons
why
this
court
would
not
want
to
reach
that
particular
issue
at
this
time.
since
kentucky
is
one
of
the
few
jurisdictions
with
jury
sentencing,
we
feel
that
any
harmless
error
analysis
would
have
to
include
kentucky's
unique
procedure
and
in
that
sense
the
policy
is
correct,
that
it
would
be
better
to
let
the
kentucky
supreme
court
address
that
issue
first.
but
secondly,
if
the
court
were
to
address
it,
bruno
v.
united
states
as
i
understand
it
is
one
of
the
leading
federal
cases
on
harmless
error,
and
again,
a
unanimous
court
rejected
the
contention
that
the
refusal
to
protect
the
construction
is
harmless
error
in
that
case.
mr.
kevin
michael
mcnally
substantial
rights,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
the
key
phrase
in
the
statute
you
refer
to.
and
we
submit
that
the
court's
holding
in
bruno
that
the
substantial
rights
of
the
defendant
were
affected
without
any
factual
analysis
in
the
opinion
indicates
that
in
this
case
it
also
affected
the
substantial
rights;
and
further,
that
the
chapman
and
harrington
analysis
is
a
stricter
standard
from
our
perspective
than
even
the
federal
harmless
error
statute,
and
in
that
sense,
since
it's
not
harmless
error
in
federal
court,
it
couldn't
possibly
be
harmless
error
once
this
court
addresses,
if
it
does,
the
question
in
federal
constitutional
terms.
and
finally,
the
evidence,
we
submit,
is
not
overwhelming
in
a
constitutional
sense,
and
indeed,
we
admit
that
there
are
substantial
incriminating
circumstances
under
which
the
defendant
was
arrested.
one
other
reason
why
a
harmless
error
analysis
wouldn't
be
practical
in
this
situation
is,
is
that
the
stronger
the
incriminating
circumstances
the
stronger
the
desire
of
the
jury
is
going
to
be
to
hear
the
defendant
testify
in
the
first
place.
and
in
that
sense
we
submit
that
harmless
error
analysis
would
be
inappropriate
as
to
this
question.
finally,
i
might
address
myself
to
the
statement
that
the
issue
was
somehow
manufactured
by
trial
counsel.
we
submit
that,
first
of
all,
the
commonwealth
conceded
below,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
because
of
his
fear
of
impeachment.
but
even,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
even
if
those
facts
weren't
in
this
case,
they
are
not
necessary
to
this
case,
they
are
merely
illustrative
of
the
legal
point
that
we
were
trying
to
make.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
believe
i've
made
all
the
points
that
we
feel
are
necessary.
