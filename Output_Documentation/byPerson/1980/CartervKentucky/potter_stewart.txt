justice
potter
stewart
this
case
no.
80-5060
is
here
by
a
reason
of
the
grant
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
in
this
case,
a
kentucky
criminal
trial
judge
refused
a
defendant's
request
to
give
the
following
instruction
to
the
jury.
“the
defendant
is
not
compelled
to
testify
and
the
fact
that
he
does
not
cannot
be
use
as
an
inference
of
guilt
and
should
not
prejudice
him
in
anyway.”
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
found
no
error.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
petitioner's
contention
that
a
defendant
upon
request
has
a
right
to
such
an
instruction
under
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
have
concluded
that
the
petitioner
is
correct.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinion.
although,
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
justice
powell
and
justice
stevens
have
each
filed
concurring
opinions
and
justice
brennan
has
joined
justice
steven's
concurrence.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
