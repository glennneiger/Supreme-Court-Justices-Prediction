mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
may
please
the
court:
my
name
is
stephen
j.
mcgovern.
i'm
assistant
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
in
this
case
that
paternity
actions
in
the
state
of
connecticut
are
civil
litigations.
mr.
blue's
brief
tries
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
explain
that
in
the
state
of
connecticut
a
paternity
action
is
instituted
by
a
verified
petitioner
with
a
summons
and
an
order
to
appear
at
a
date
certain
for
trial.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
there
is
a
state
statute
which
provides
for
nonsupport.
that
is
a
criminal
statute.
however,
stemming
from
the
paternity
judgment,
in
the
paternity
section
of
our
statutes
there
is
a
provision
for
contempt
citations.
they
are
civil
contempts.
they're
remedial
in
nature
and
they're
not
punitive.
the
goal
of
these
contempts
is
to
secure
the
money
that
is
not
paid.
to
have
the
defendant
in
a
paternity
case
be
found
to
be
in
contempt
of
court
for
nonpayment
of
support,
there
must
be
a
showing
that
he
willfully
failed
to
meet
the
support
order.
he
either
refused
or
neglected
to
pay
it.
the
fact
the
defendant
is
indigent
would
certainly
not
be
the
basis
for
his
incarceration
as
being
in
contempt.
the
paternity
action
is
brought
by
a
regular
civil
complaint
for
a
date
certain.
as
in
other
states...
some
states
provide
that
a
defendant
would
be
arrested
and
have
to
post
bail.
that
is
not
the
case
in
connecticut.
a
civil
trial
is
held,
there
is
an
adjudication,
possibly,
of
paternity.
that
adjudication
certainly
doesn't
subject
the
defendant
to
incarceration.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
only
aspect--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
would
say,
that
is
the
only
aspect
of
the
proceedings
which
may
make
it
appear
to
be
criminal
in
nature.
in
every
other
aspect
it
is
civil
in
nature.
the
contempt
proceeding
which
i've
alluded
to
is
an
independent
action
brought
under
another
statute.
it
does
not
stem
from
a
paternity
judgment
itself.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
for
the
taxing
of
cost.
the
paternity
statute
itself,
under
which
judgment
is
entered,
provides
that
the
cost
of
support
and
maintenance
of
the
minor
child,
attorneys'
fees,
sheriff's
fees,
may
be
taxed
as
cost.
there
is
no
provision
under
the
statute
that
the
cost
of
the
blood
grouping
test
be
paid
and
i
have
never
seen
a
case
in
which
a
defendant
prevailed
in
the
state
of
connecticut
in
which
costs
were
taxed
against
the
state.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
i
think
this
is--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--state
pays
for
the
attorney,
your
honor--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that's
just
one
piece
of
evidence.
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
state
does
not
pay
for
the
lawyer.
it
would
appear
in
this
case
that
mr.
blue
is
from
legal
aid
for
prisoners.
i
believe
the
state
funds
that
organization
so
in
effect
the
state
is--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
i
would
say,
your
honor,
if
he
was
incarcerated,
as
is
the
case
here,
yes.
if
he
wasn't
incarcerated,
he
would
be
directed
by
the
court
to
go
to
a
legal
assistance.
i
have
not
seen
a
case
where
the
court
will
appoint
an
attorney
to
represent
somebody
in
a
contempt
hearing.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
i
believe
it
might
be
possible
that
he
could.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
i
don't
believe
he
does,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
state
in
that
situation,
your
honor...
the
case
would
have
been
referred
to
another
state
agency
to
bring
a
reciprocal
support
action,
reciprocal
paternity
action,
and
the
paternity
action
would
most
likely
have
to
be
brought
in
that
state.
in
the
compact
among
states--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--i
know,
within
connecticut
itself--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
if
the
defendant
resides
in
connecticut,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
no,
no,
the
state
would
not
pay
his
expenses.
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
no,
default
without...
he
has
a
right
to
counsel.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
he's
served
by
a
sheriff
for
him
to
appear
at
a
date
certain
under
cited
court
order.
correct,
if
he
doesn't
appear,
yes,
a
default
would
enter.
that's
correct.
in
a
paternity
litigation,
if
a
defendant
does
not
appear
for
trial,
a
default
will
enter
against
him.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
but
first
he
has
four
months
to
reopen
the
judgment.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
his
transportation
fees?
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
exactly.
this
is
a
civil
litigation.
if
the
state
was
bringing
an
action,
some
other
civil
action,
for
reimbursement--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--i
don't
believe
there's
any
other,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
thank
you.

[recess.]
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
due
process
requires
that
the
defendant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
manner
at
a
meaningful
time.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
even
without
a
blood
grouping
test
he
has
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
way.
defendant
in
this
action,
the
appellant
here,
has
legal
counsel
at
no
cost.
he
has
the
ability
to
cross-examine
the
plaintiff
in
the
action.
he
has
the
ability
to
take
the
witness
stand
on
his
own
behalf,
he
has
the
ability
to
call
witnesses,
he
has
the
ability
to
use
all
the
discovery
techniques
available
within
our
civil
rules.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that
is
true,
your
honor.
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
on
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof.
she
must
remain
constant
in
her
accusation.
and
that
constancy
can
be
attacked
under
cross-examination.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
under
connecticut
law,
if
the
plaintiff
does
remain
constant
in
her
accusation,
and
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
court
may
find
the
defendant
to
be
the
father
of
the
child.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
if
the
plaintiff
remains
constant
in
her
accusation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
he
does
have
the
burden
of--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
defendant
filed
60
interrogatories.
he
has
other
methods
available
to
him
besides
the
blood
grouping
test
in
which
to
defend
the
action.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
it
is
the
most
reliable.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
well,
i
would
agree
with
that
also,
your
honor.
there
is
an
interest
of
the
child
to
be
considered.
but
there
must
be--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
has
stated
that
paternity
action
is
nothing
more
than
a
shifting
of
economic
arrangements
from
one
party
to
another.
paternity
legislation
in
connecticut
is
considered
to
fall
in
social...
as
social
and
economic
legislation.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
there's
no
differentiation.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
i
think,
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
your
honor,
the
statute
is
written
to
only
allow
admissibility
of
the
test
to
exclude
the
defendant.
the
statute
does
not,
cannot
be
used,
to
include
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
so,
i
feel,
if
the
statute
remains
in
its
current
form,
the
rights
of
the
child
can
best
be
protected
by
having
the
test
paid
for
by
the
party
who
seeks
to
provide
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
well,
we
have
to
assume,
your
honor,
that
the
mother
has
named
the
real
father.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
there
have
been
errors
made,
but
in
the
majority
of
instances,
certainly--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--certainly,
your
honor,
and
the
majority,
in
most
of
the
cases,
the
defendant
who
is
named
in
the
litigation
is
found
to
be
the
father.
it's
not
a
case
of--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
your
honor,
this
is
civil
litigation.
we're
asking
the
state
to
fund
a
defense
for
a
man
with
civil
litigation.
we
have
to
assume
that
on
the
facts
presented
at
the
trial,
that
the
judge
weighed
the
evidence--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--it
was
brought
by
the
plaintiff,
your
honor.
the
plaintiff's
mother--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--the
state
funded
the
attorney.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
required
her?
certainly.
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
has
held
in
the
case
of
robertson
v.
apuzzo.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
if...
that's
correct.
if
the
father
has
the
financial
ability
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
child,
which
are
greater
that
the
amount
of
assistance
that
the
state
gives
the
child,
she
would
be
removed.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
she
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
defendant
is
the
father
by
a
fair--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--yes,
your
honor,
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--as
in
a
criminal
litigation;
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
that's
correct,
throughout
this
trial.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
excuse
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
she
does
have
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
defendant
can
introduce
evidence
to
rebut
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
plaintiff.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
well,
i
would
state--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--his
testimony
alone
is
not
as
long
as
the
plaintiff
remains
constant
in
her
accusation
that
the
defendant
is
the
father
of
the
child.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
as
long...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
no,
i
can't
point
to
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
case
law
of
connecticut
states
that
the
mother
of
the
child
if
she
remains
constant
in
her
accusation
that
defendant
is
the
father
of
the
child,
paternity
is
an
issue.
if
she
remains
constant
and
that
accusation
is
not
rebutted
or
torn
down,
yes,
the
defendant
will
be
found--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--if
that
was
the
testimony,
she
would
win.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
fact
that
other
states
have
chosen
to
fund
the
cost
of
blood
grouping
tests
does
not
mean
that
the
state
of
connecticut
should
be
made
to
do
likewise.
the
state
has
certain
priorities
in
administering
its
judicial
system.
it
chooses
to
have
the
litigants
in
civil
litigation
bear
the
cost
of
that
litigation.
i
think
that
this
is
reasonably
based.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
in
this
action
there
were
no
witnesses
other
than
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--the
party--
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
--the
state
would
probably...
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
would
pay
for
the
witnesses;
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
the
circuit
court
no
longer
exists
in
connecticut.
that
was
the
court
of
lower
jurisdiction
which
existed
in
connecticut
during
the
early
1970s.
that
court
was
abolished
and
became
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
the
courts
evolved
and
merged
into
one
court
at
this
time,
a
superior
court.
that
was
not
a
decision
of
the
court
of
highest
jurisdiction
in
the
state;
a
trial
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
of
blood
grouping
tests?
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
currently
that
is
the
law
of
connecticut,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
mcgovern
no,
it
hasn't.
no.
that
issue
hasn't
been
before
the
court
since
then.
finally,
your
honor,
the
appellant
has
argued
that,
he
hasn't
argued
today
but
in
his
brief
that
this
inability
to
provide
a
blood
grouping
test
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
normally,
this
court
in
making
equal
protection
analysis
has
used
either
a
strict
scrutiny
test
or
a
rational
basis
test.
strict
scrutiny
is
invoked
when
there's
a
fundamental
right
which
has
been
violated
or
a
suspect
classification
exists.
i
don't
believe
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
the
right
to
a
blood
test,
is
a
fundamental
right
in
a
civil
litigation,
and
also
that
wealth-indigency
is
one
of
those
suspect
classes
which
warrant
strict
scrutiny
by
the
court
and
require
the
court
to
show
that
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
in
the
statute.
the
state
of
connecticut
should
be
made
to
comply
with
the
rational
basis
test
and
only
have
to
show
that
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
statute
with
the
cost
being
paid
only
by
the
party
who
wishes
to
use
the
evidence
in
the
litigation.
