justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
another
answer?
if
the
witness
is
within
the
jurisdiction
and
subject
to
process,
if
he's
a
$289
expert,
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
subpoena
him,
doesn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
has
an
absolute
right,
even
though
it
costs
a
little
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
even
conceivable,
is
it,
because
you
just
take
another
test
if
you
had
doubt
about
whether
you
got
the
right
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
mcgovern,
do
you
know,
in
a
case
that
does
not
involve
a
nonindigent,
say,
a
defendant
had
a
blood
test
made
and
he
paid
for
it,
could
he
recover
the
cost
of
the
blood
test
from
the
plaintiff
in
his
cost-taxing
costs
of
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
about
costs
that
justice
marshall's
question
prompted.
under
your
practice,
if
the
defendant
is
in
jail
and
has
no
money
and
has
ten
alibi
witnesses
that
he
wants
to
subpoena
to
prove
he
was
in
angola
or
someplace
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
incident,
does
he
have
compulsory
process
available
to
subpoena
the
witnesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
any
witnesses
who
would
testify
on
his
behalf
would
be
just
volunteers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
mcgovern,
do
you
disagree
though
with
the
general
appraisal
of
the
reliability
of
the
blood
test
that
your
opponent
asserts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
it's
available,
that
really
is
the
most
reliable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question
in
terms
of,
we
talked
about
slippery
slopes
and
that
sort
of
thing
here,
is
it
possible
that
there's
another
interest
that
should
be
considered
in
the
whole
equation,
and
that
is,
the
interest
of
the
child
makes
it
especially
important
that
the
correct
answer
be
given
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
typical
in
litigation
between
private
parties?
