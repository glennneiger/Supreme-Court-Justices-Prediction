chief
justice

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
little
v.
streater.
mr.
blue,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose,
not
in
the
same
sense
but
with
the
same
result,
an
alibi
witness
showing
that
the
gentleman
was
in
angola
at
the
time
as
a
war
correspondent
would
produce
a
favorable
result
for
him,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
the
consequence
in
terms
of
the
judgment
or
verdict,
as
the
case
may
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
trier
or
the
triers
if
it's
a
jury,
compelled
to
believe
any
expert
testimony?
this
is
in
the
category
of
expert
testimony,
i
take
it.
are
they
compelled
to
believe
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
cross-examine
the
people
who
make
the
test,
can't
you,
and
isn't
there
often
cross-examination
of
experts
who
make
tests?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
we've
taken,
or
you
have
taken
with
us
two-thirds
of
your
time
on
this
scientific-medical.
i'll
just
ask
you
one
short
question.
are
you
familiar
with
the
numerous
cases
of
malpractice
brought
against
laboratories
that
do
blood
testing
for
making
errors
in
the
blood
tests
which
cause
damage
to
the
people
involved
because
the
doctors
relied
on
the
tests?
are
you
familiar
with
the
fact
that
that's
happened?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
use
a
blood--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--you
use
it
for
other
purposes
than
paternity
cases,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
use
blood
grouping
tests
for
other
purposes
than
paternity
cases,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
give
the
wrong
blood
to
a
person
in
a
transfusion,
you're
in
a
very
serious
business.
that's
where
some
of
these
malpractice
suits
have
developed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcgovern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
respect,
it
would
be
no
different
from
a
traffic
violation
or
a
negligence
case
or
any
other
case,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
resume
there
at
1
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcgovern,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
the
purpose
of
this
inquiry?
is
it
for
anything
other
than
economic
purposes?
isn't
it
to
decide
whether--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't...
going
back
to
one
of
your
previous
responses,
is
there
any
question
about
that
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
is
purely
economic,
to
identify
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
future
support
of
the
child?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
