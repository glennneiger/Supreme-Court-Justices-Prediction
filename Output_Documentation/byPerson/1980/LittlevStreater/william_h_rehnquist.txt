justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
marijuana
case
or
a
drug
possession
case,
for
example,
a
typical
type
of
evidence
put
on
is
to
show
that
the
packet
possessed
by
the
defendant
was
the
same
one
submitted
to
the
laboratory
and
is
now
in
court.
and
certainly
the
defense
lawyer
is
permitted
to
cross-examine
as
to
the
passage
of
control
from
one
person
to
another
in
that
chain.
i
would
think,
in
laboratory
examinations,
that
defense
counsel
is
certainly
permitted
in
most
states,
at
any
rate,
to
cross-examine
as
to,
was
this
blood
testimony,
or
was
this
blood
sample
the
one
actually
taken?
was
there
a
mix-up
in
the
laboratory?
and
that
type
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
the
cost
of
a
blood
test
sampling
taxable
as
costs
in
a
paternity
proceeding
in
which
the
defendant
is
acquitted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
practice
in
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
cuyler
v.
sullivan,
last
year,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
standard
for
performance
of
counsel
retained
was
the
same
as
the
counsel
appointed,
because
the
resulting
judgment
was
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
imposing
a
certain
penalty
on
a
person,
and
therefore
it
was
state
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
well,
wouldn't
that
apply
here
too,
whether
it's
a
private
plaintiff
or
the
state
is
a
plaintiff?
the
resulting
judgment
is
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
saying
that
defendant
d
is
the
father
of
the
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
in
connecticut,
is
it
a
jury
case
or
a
court
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
throughout
the
country,
in
your
survey,
is
there
any
preponderance
of
evidence,
or
preponderance
of
practice
as
to
whether
these
cases
are
tried
by
juries
or
by
judges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcgovern,
do
you
understand
the
gist
of
your
opponent's
complaint
in
this
case
to
be
the
failure
of
the
state
of
connecticut
to
allow
blood
grouping
tests
to
be
taxed
against
a
state
or
against
the
private
plaintiff,
if
it
were
to
go
that
far,
if
the
blood
grouping
tests
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trier
of
fact
that
the
defendant
is
not
the
father,
or
the
failure
to
advance
the
money
necessary
to
get
the
blood
grouping
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
that
the
same
whether
the
action
is
initiated
by
the
state
or
by
the
private
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
the
burden
of
proof
the
same,
whether
it's
initiated
by
the
state
or
by
the
private
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
tell
us
where
in
the
case
materials
the
statute
or
decision
is
that
supports
the...
i
too
sense
somewhat
differing
answers
to
the
questions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you
answer
the
question
then?
i
mean,
it
must
be
in
a
case
or
in
a
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
case
is
it
in
connecticut
that
says--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcgovern,
the
most
recent
case
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief,
to
which
my
brother
stewart
has
referred,
is
a
case
called,
cited
as
6
connecticut
circuit
court
516.
what
is
the
circuit
court
in
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
most
recent
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
connecticut
on
the
subject?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
as
to
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
burden
of
proof,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
1929
case.
has
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut--
