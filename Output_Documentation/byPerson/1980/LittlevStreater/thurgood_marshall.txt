justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can't
cross-examine
a
blood
test.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that's
not
attacking
the
evidence.
the
evidence
is--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
it's
never
been
disputed;
it's
never
been
disputed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
how
you
could
get
a
witness
to
say
that
a
blood
test
isn't
accurate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
blue,
before
you
leave
that--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--can
you
draw
the
line
as
to
what
the
state
wouldn't
be
required
to
pay
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
could
you
say
that
if
there
is
an
expert
in
the
field
of
something
who
is
in
south
africa,
that
the
state
would
be
obliged
to
bring
him
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
expert
could
be
obtained
for
$289.
would
you
have
to
get
him?
you're
not
going
to
put
it
on
money,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
that
he
is
"guilty"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
did,
if
you
put
the
costs
of
this
blood
test
in
the
costs,
he
would
have
to
pay
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn't
you
do
that?
why
couldn't
the
state
do
that?
all
the
other
courts
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
the
state
do
it
in
all
the
other
costs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
court,
the
judge,
and
everything,
didn't
they?
they
paid
for
all
the
costs
but
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
civil
action
does
the
state
pay
for
the
lawyer
to
prosecute
the
action
for
a
private
individual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it's
still
civil?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--doesn't
he
have
to
do
something
other
than
his
own
testimony?
doesn't
connecticut
require
him
to
do
more
than
just
testify
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
does
have
a
burden
in
doing
more
than
the
direct
testimony.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
have
the
hearing?
if
the
mother
is
willing,
why
have
the
hearing?
the
question
is,
you
said
that
when
the
mother
said
that
this
is
the
man,
that's
it.
my
answer
is,
why
hold
the
hearing?
the
mother
says...
in
this
particular
case,
is
anybody
certain
that
this
man
is
the
father,
as
of
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
be
certain
when
he's
never
had
a
blood
test,
when
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
blood
test
would
show
that
he
was
not
the
correct
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
with
justice
blackmun.
this
is
labeled
a
civil
action,
but
it
was
brought
by
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
gave
the
plaintiff
the
lawyer
to
bring
the
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
state
asked
her
to
bring
it.
required
her
to
bring
it,
if
she
wanted
any
support.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
she
wanted
benefits.
and
that's
a
private
litigation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
put
"private"
into
quotes?
i'm
not
sure
i'll
buy
it
in
quotes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
pays
for
the
witnesses
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
normally,
who
would
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
would.
the
state
pays
for
the
lawyer,
it
would
pay
for
the
witnesses,
wouldn't
it?
