justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
blue,
before
you
sit
down?
when
you
come
back
with
your
reply,
if
you
could
state
a
limiting
principle,
in
light
of
all
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
you,
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
do
you
avoid
the
slippery
slope
type
questions
that
have
been
asked
here
in
some
abundance,
as
a
general
principle
the
courts
can
apply?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
also?
if
the
defendant
in
this
case
had
lived
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
away
and
is
not
in
prison,
would
the
state
pay
his
expenses
to
come
to
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
different
state.
connecticut
is--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
virginia
you
can
be
400
miles
away.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
pay
his
expenses?
suppose
he
said,
i'm
dead
broke,
i
can't
come
to
hartford
or
wherever
you're
going
to
try
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
wouldn't
be
there
to
testify.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
mcgovern,
i'm
not
clear
as
to
the
burden
of
proof.
this
suit
was
instituted
by
the
mother.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
does
she
have
the
burden
of
persuasion,
the
overall
burden
of
proof
throughout
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that's
at
issue,
isn't
it?
that's
at
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
she
has
the
normal
burden
in
a
civil
case?
justice
jr.
that
isn't
what
you
said
a
minute
ago.
i
thought
you--
--throughout
this
trial.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
your
question
that
led
him
to
say
just
the
opposite,
i
think,
mr.
justice
white.
well,
i
didn't
think
it
led
him
anywhere.
i
thought
something
led
him.
i
never
heard
of
a
civil
plaintiff
not
having
the
burden
of
proof,
not
having
the
burden
of
persuasion
throughout
a
trial.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course.
but
who
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
at
the
end
of
the
trial?
