mr.
jon
c.
blue
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
time
to
time
in
the
history
of
our
country
technological
innovations
have
played
a
decisive
role
in
the
formation
of
constitutional
doctrine.
this
is
a
paternity
case
in
which
an
indigent
defendant
was
denied
access
to
a
blood
grouping
test
that
conclusively
exonerates
more
than
90
percent
of
all
falsely
accused
putative
fathers.
a
connecticut
statute
categorically
restricts
access
to
this
test
to
those
defendants
able
to
purchase
it
in
advance
of
trial.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
it
exonerates
90
percent
of
innocent
putative
fathers
100
percent
of
the
time.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
100
accused
putative
fathers,
none
of
whom
are
the
actual
fathers.
the
blood
test,
standard
blood
test
available
everywhere,
will
conclusively
show
that
91
or
93,
depending
on
the
race,
of
those
men
are
not
the
father.
with
the
other
seven
to
nine
percent,
the
test
will
simply
be
inconclusive.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
and
when
the
blood
test--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that
is
exactly
correct.
the
capability
of
medical
science
is
simply
that
it
will
prove
that
exclusion
to
approximately
91
or
93
percent.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
approximately
91
to
93
percent,
but
with
those
innocent
defendants,
there
is
no
doubt,
it
is
100.
the
proof
with
those
defendants
rises
to
100
percent.
but
the
others
are
simply
inconclusive.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
certainly,
in
fact--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--oh,
absolutely,
and
the
state
does
not--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--question
this
in
its
own
brief.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
not
in
the
same
way
that
a
blood
test
evidence
produces
the
favorable
result.
because
when
the
blood
test
evidence--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--no,
because
blood
test
evidence
of
exclusion
is
tantamount
to
automatic
acquittal
of
the
defendant
in
practice.
it
does
not
turn
on
credibility.
an
alibi
witness,
to
use
the
example
you
chose,
is
only
exculpatory
if
that
alibi
evidence
is
believed.
the
two
are
not
comparable
in
fact.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
connecticut
state
law
on
the
subject,
although
the
statute
we
are
appealing
from
speaks
in
terms
of
definite
exclusion.
i
can
represent
to
you
that
there
is
simply
no
one
case
in
the
history
of
connecticut,
so
far
as
i
know,
in
which
a
defendant
has
been
found
guilty
in
the
face
of
exculpatory
blood
test
evidence,
and
does
in
fact
have
this
practical--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--well,
that's
correct;
that's
correct.
and
it's
quite
a
different
proposition
than
an
alibi
witness
which
raises
problems
of
credibility
in
virtually
any
case.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
well,
that
is
correct,
because
this
is
quite
a
different
type
of
evidence
than
ordinary
expert
witness
testimony
that
we're
inclined
to
think
of
in,
for
example
criminal
cases;
in,
for
example,
a
criminal
case
where
you
have
psychiatric
testimony
indicating
that
the
defendant
is
or
is
not
sane.
you
will
have
a
situation
in
which
different
experts
might
hold
honestly,
might
honestly
hold
different
beliefs
and
have
different
observations
of
the
same
phenomena.
this
is
not
the
case
with
blood
test
evidence
where
there
is
a
showing
of
exclusion;
there
will
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
fact
that
the
man
is
in
fact
excluded,
and
you
simply
do
not
have
the
type
of
disagreement
between
expert
witnesses
that
you
would,
for
example,
in
a
criminal
case
involving
psychiatric
testimony.
it
is
really
quite
a
distinct
type
of
evidence
even
in
the
universe
of
expert
testimony.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
it
would
depend
on
the
particular
state
procedure.
but--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that's
not
attacking
the
evidence
itself.
it's
a
very
tangible
type
of
thing.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
it
would
be
a
very
rare
case
where
you
would
have
actual--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that's
right.
it
would
virtually
never
happen.
i
mean...
theoretically,
some
state
laws
might
permit
cross-examination
as
to
whether
blood
samples
have
been
switched,
but
in
practice,
the
practical
effect
of
that
type
of
allowance
is
de
minimis
because
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
i
think
that
even
my
opponent
would
concede
that
blood
test
evidence
does
have
an
indisputable
quality
to
it
when
it
yields
an
indication
of
exoneration.
and
it
does
have
a
sweeping
capability
to
exonerate
that
is
simply
not
shared
by
other
evidence,
be
is
testimonial
evidence
or
for
that
matter
other
scientific
evidence
in
the
ordinary
cases
that
one
might
think
of.
now,
it's
our
position
that
these
distinctions
which
i
have
drawn
make
the
constitutional
difference,
and
the
difference
goes
to
both
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
court,
or
of
the
factfinder,
whichever
that
may
be,
and
also
because
the
inevitable
result
of
the
distinction
or
the
discrimination
that
connecticut
has
chosen
to
draw
is
a
dual
system
of
justice.
i
recall,
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
raddatz
last
term,
justice
blackmun
in
his
concurring
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
focus
of
the
due
process
clause
is
a
practical
concern
for
accurate
results,
and
surely
few
cases
can
be
imagined
in
which
that
practical
concern
has
a
greater
impact
than
in
this
case.
this
court
has
particularly
been
concerned
with
accuracy
in
the
past
years
in
fourth
amendment
cases
involving
the
exclusionary
rule
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
in
some
states
it's
discretionary
though
i
believe
i
mentioned
that
in
a
footnote
in
my
brief.
in
connecticut
there
is
no
reason
as
to
why
it
might
not
be,
and
i
would
simply
point
out
in
that
regard
that
we
are
not
asking
for
a
gratuitous
subsidy.
but
the
state
could,
to
minimize
its
own
expenditure
of
costs,
simply
require
that
when
the
blood
test
fails,
is
taken
and
fails
to
exonerate
the
defendant,
that
the
cost
will
be
taxed
as
cost.
i
believe
that
that
is
done
specifically
by
statute
in
kansas
and
wisconsin,
at
least.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
i'm
not
prepared
to
say.
i
simply
don't
know.
i
wanted
to
point
out,
on
the
fact
of
the
impact
of
the
accuracy
of
the
test
under
the
due
process
clause,
not
only
do
we
have
justice
blackmun's
statement
about--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--the
court...
i
have
cited
a
source
for
that
proposition.
the
court
might
refer
to
the
schatkin
treatise
which
i
cite
on
page
11
of
my
brief,
which
has
pages
and
pages
and
pages
of
footnotes
supporting
the
proposition
cited
in
my
brief
that
in
the
overwhelming
weight
of
contemporary
authority,
is
to
treat
blood
grouping
tests
as
decisive
and
conclusive--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--when
they
are
negative.
because
there
is
no
doubt--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--i
think
you're
thinking
of
ross
v.
marks--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--i
would
point
out
that
there
is
an
historical
distinction
that
can
be
made
here.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
in
the
cortese
case?
mr.
jon
c.
blue
yes.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
yes.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
in
the
very
early
years,
in
the
late
'30s,
early
'40s,
when
blood
tests
were
new
and
people
didn't
really
appreciate
them,
perhaps
the
tests
were
of
a
somewhat
cruder
quality,
or
there
was
some
authority
to
the
contrary;
there
was
virtually
no
authority
to
the
contrary
in
the
last
20
or
30
years.
the
tests
are
conclusive.
i
would
point
out
that--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--certainly?
mr.
jon
c.
blue
i
think
that
there
are
two--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--no.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
the
difference
is
two-fold.
in
the
first
place,
an
ordinary
expert
witness
testimony
will
turn,
as
other
testimony
on
matters
of
credibility,
can
be
disputed.
moreover,
with
exotic
testimony,
it
will
require
a
great
deal
of
money
to
obtain.
you
are
out
of
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
test
is
readily
available,
and
not
only
will
you--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--well,
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
the
type
of
evidence
which
is
ordinarily
obtainable
by
the
typical
nonindigent
defendant
and
the
type
of
evidence
which
would
only
be
available
to
more
wealthy
people
which
would
create
a
somewhat
different
equal
protection
argument.
with
the
type
of
expert...
of
course
you
haven't
elaborated
what
type
of
expert
in
south
africa
you're
referring
to,
if
the
expert
was
an
expert
comparable
to
blood
test
evidence
in
the
sense
that
he
was
overwhelmingly
likely
to
conclusively
show,
conclusively
show
that
the
defendant
was
innocent
if
he
was
in
fact
innocent,
then
that
would
present
a
case,
obviously,
very
similar
to
the
case
we
have
before
us,
but
expert--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that
is
correct
for
the
typical
expert
testimony.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
but
this
is
not
expert
opinion
testimony.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
this
is
a
factual--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that's
absolutely
correct,
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i'm
trying
to
draw
between
the
expert
that
one
might...
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
the
question
rarely
arises
because
when
there
is
a
medical
showing
of
exclusion,
typically
the
defendant
will
typically
withdraw
the
case,
or
it
would
often
be
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
will
be
granted--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--if
the
state
insists
that
it
cross-examines
the
expert
witness
in
a
case
like
this
where
there
is
a
showing
of
exclusion,
i
would
argue
to
the
right,
i'm
arguing,
the
right
i'm
arguing
for
would
be
meaningless
if
the
resources
were
not
provided
to
bring
this
expert
witness
to
court,
if
it
was
the
state
was
choosing
to
dispute
it
in
the
first
place.
i
would
just
point
out--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--if
the
state
chose
to
dispute
that
type
of
evidence.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
no,
i
would
think
not.
i
would
certainly
have
no
problem
in
that
instance,
which
i
emphasize
is
atypical
in
practice,
in
fact,
very
atypical.
but
if
it's
the
state
that's
bringing
it,
and
i'm
only
concerning
myself
with
actions
brought
by
the
state
in
the
first
place,
that
then
the
state
should
have
to
come
up
with
the
money.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
what
do
you
mean
by
the
other
situation,
justice
blackmun?
mr.
jon
c.
blue
in
due
process
terms
i
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
plaintiff,
the
actual
plaintiff
is
the
state
or
a
purely
private
person.
because
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison
company,
draws
a
sharp
distinction
between
deprivations
by
the
state
and
deprivations
by
private
people,
no
matter
how
wrongful,
against
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
offers
no
appeal.
in
terms
of
equal
protection,
it
may
well
not
be
evident
who
is
the
plaintiff.
the
same
disparity
of
treatment
would
exist
between
indigent
defendants
and
nonindigent
defendants.
but
the
state
is
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
the
only
line
that
i
am
urging
the
court
to
draw
certainly
in
terms
of
due
process
is
a
line
that
involves
the
fact
that
the
real
force,
the
real
moving
party
in
interest
here
was
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that
is
in
large
part
correct,
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
like
the
would-be
plaintiffs
in
boddie,
who
were
would-be
plaintiffs,
there
is
no
alternative
to
the
judicial
process
for
the
defendant
in
this
case.
and
i
suppose,
unlike
boddie,
he
may
not
be...
mr.
little
may
not
be
analogized
to
a
defendant,
he
is
a
defendant,
and
there's
no
question
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
the
appropriate
level
of
judicial
scrutiny
that
typically--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--well,
i'm
trying
to
draw...
i
understand
your...
i
appreciate--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--well,
you
quickly
got
off
in
kras
and
ortwein.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
but
the
way
you
got
off,
and
the
distinction
that
you
drew
to
get
off,
was
the
distinction
between
voluntary
and
involuntary
litigants.
the
court
emphasized
in
kras
and
reemphasized
in
ortwein
that
the
would-be
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
had
alternatives
to
the
judicial
process,
alternatives
which
the
defendant
here
in
this
case
simply
doesn't
have.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
like
in
shelley
v.
kramer?
mr.
jon
c.
blue
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
a
legitimate
argument,
and
the
court
might
well
rightfully
hold
that
the
same
result
should
pertain
to
all
defendants,
whether
or
not
they're
prosecuted
by
the
state.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
fact
remains
that
the
real
plaintiff
here,
throwing
all
its
power
and
resources
at
the
indigent
defendant,
was
the
state.
and
in
terms
of
traditional
due
process
analysis,
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
oh,
it's
absolutely
mandated
by
state
law
which
is,
in
turn,
mandated
by
federal
law,
although
the
state
law--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that's
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
right.
she--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--that's
right.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
in
this
case,
yes.
i
think
it's
on
pages
20
and
21
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
a
question
i
would
like
for
you,
very
much
to
see
you
ask
my
colleague,
mr.
mcgovern.
under
connecticut
state
law,
as
i
have
pondered
the
question,
i
believe
that
the
judgment
is
clearly
res
judicata.
it
would
ease--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--oh,
absolutely.
the
question
has
not
been
litigated
in
connecticut
to
the
best,
as
best
i
have
researched
it.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
i
don't
know,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
question
has
even
come
up.
let
me
explain
the
practical
reason
why
the
question
probably
has
never
come
up.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
the
problem
is
that
it's
not
just
the
matter
of
a
man
who
has
suddenly
won
the
lottery
after
years
of
indigency
walking
into
a
hospital
and
asking
for
a
blood
test
to
be
taken.
the
blood
test
must
be
taken
from
the
child,
the
mother,
and
the
putative
father,
and
in
order
to
practically
arrange
for
that
type
of
a
blood
test
to
be
taken
you
need
a
court
order.
and
in
the
absence
of
an
existing
open
case,
that
type
of
court
order
is
virtually
impossible
to
get.
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
in
which,
at
any
level,
at
which
that
question
you
raise
has
been
decided
and
i
suspect
that
the
reason
is
the
very
practical
reason
that
i've
discussed,
which
simply
points
out
the
fact
that
because
of
the
fortuity
that
the
defendant
is
indigent
at
the
time
the
case
is
brought,
and
if
he
is
indeed
found
guilty
without
the
absence
of
blood
test
evidence
he,
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
will
never
in
practical
or
legal
terms
be
able
to
reopen
that
case.
and
any
money
that
he
gets
subsequently
that
might
be
used
to
pay
for
a
blood
test
will
in
fact
only
be
usable
to
pay
for
the
judgment
deficiency
against
him.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
a
connecticut
statute
now
requires,
i
believe,
a
$60
fee
for
a
jury.
my
client
did
not
have
the
money
to
pay
for
that
jury.
the
case
ultimately
went
to
a
court
trial
with
a
trial
judge.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
it's
my
strong
impression,
justice
rehnquist,
that
in
virtually
all
states
the
issue
is
at
least
triable
before
a
jury.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
mr.
chief
justice,
perhaps
through
my
own
lack
of
knowledge
i'm
not
familiar
with
those
cases
in
the
particular
context
of
blood
grouping
tests
in
paternity
cases.
i
mean,
there
are
a
variety
of
blood
tests.
for
instance,
tests
for
venereal
disease--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--which
might
in
fact
be
quite
different.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
yes.
different
types
of
tests.
i
mean,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
blood
test
is
a
generic
term.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
blood
grouping
test.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
possibly.
i--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--okay.
well,
my
only...
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
phenomenon,
although
i'm
not
disputing
that
the
phenomenon
may
exist.
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not...
is
simply
the
fact
that
blood
grouping
tests
in
the
context
of
ongoing
paternity
cases
are
treated
as
controlling
and
decisive.
and
this
fact,
this
indisputable
fact...
i
don't
think
that
the
attorney
general
even
disputes
it...
necessarily
results
in,
when
you
have
a
distinction
like
the
connecticut
legislature
has
drawn
in
this
case,
of
a
gross
disparity
between
the
indigent
and
the
non-indigent
in
as
far
as
the
quality
of
justice
administered
or
received
by
these
litigants,
not
just
wealthy
litigants,
but
nonindigent
litigants
receive
if
they
are
innocent,
are
overwhelmingly
likely
to
receive
swift,
scientific,
certain
exoneration,
whereas
all
indigent
defendants
regardless
of
their
actual
guilt
or
innocence
are
thrust
into
swearing
contests
in
which
the
trier
of
fact
will
often
desperately
try
to
arrive
at
the
correct
result.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
connecticut
labels
them
as
civil
but--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--in
connecticut,
if
you
research
connecticut
law,
the
findings
in
paternity
cases
are
specifically
referred
to
as
guilty
or
not
guilty.
in
fact...
this
was
not
a
jury
case,
but
in
a
paternity
jury
case,
the
jury
will
be
instructed
by
the
trier
of
fact,
by
the
court,
to
deliver
a
finding
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
i
would
still
draw
a
distinction
between
this
type
of
evidence
which
is--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--in
practice
is
universally
exculpatory,
and
the
type
of
ballistics
evidence
which
is
typically
just
an
indication
of
guilt
or
innocence
rather
than...
a
ballistic
showing
will
rarely
in
and
of
itself
show--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--i'm
not
an
expert
in
handwriting
or
ballistics--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--well,
i
would
argue
with
that.
i
think
that
in
practice
it
is
simply
not--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--where
there
is
a
showing
of
exclusion
that
is
in
fact
the
case.
there
is
no--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--yes,
sure.
it's
unlike
psychiatric
testimony.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
is
not
like
the
example
i
used
of
psychiatric
testimony
in
a
criminal
proceeding
where
you
will
have
expert
witnesses
on
either
side
testifying
the
opposite
thing.
that
is--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--i
know
of
no...
i
mean,
obviously,
the
example
you
give
is
a
conceivable
example.
i
simply
know
of
no
such
case
and
the
courts--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--well,
that's
exactly
it.
and
the
important
thing
that
i
want
to
leave
this
court
with,
now
that
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
is
that
the
fact
that
these
tests
are
universally
given
decisive
and
controlling
importance
is
the
fact
that
creates
the
disparity
between
the
nonindigent
and
the
indigent
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
i'll
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
with
the
chief
justice's
permission
i'll
do
that
now,
since
my
time
has
just
expired.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
that's
right.
the
distinctions
i
would
draw
are,
one,
the
role
of
the
state
in
this
case,
which
i
think
is
a
legitimate
distinction
this
court
can
draw.
and,
two,
the
nature
of
the
evidence
which,
unlike
other
evidence
either
expert
or
other
testimonial
evidence,
is
when
it
yields
a
finding
of
exoneration
will
conclusively
and
beyond
dispute
show
that
in
fact
the
defendant
is
not
the
father
of
the
child
in
question.
it
is
that
type
of
conclusive
aspect
to
the
evidence
in
question
that
i
think
is
a
legitimate
distinguishing
principle
that
this
court
can
avoid
the
slippery
slope
which
i
know
that
it
obviously
will
have
in
mind.
but
i
think
that
the
court
by
crafting
its
opinion
in
that
way
can
avoid
the
implications
that
the
court
did,
you
are
concerned
with,
justice
powell.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
i
simply
don't
know--
mr.
jon
c.
blue
--connecticut
and
north
carolina.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
as
the
amicus
brief
points
out,
even
to
connecticut,
under
federal
regulations,
the
federal
government
would
reimburse
75
percent
of
the
cost,
but
the
state
would
have
to
pay
for
it
first.
mr.
jon
c.
blue
if
there
have
been
those
proposals,
and
there
doubtless
have,
at
some
point,
they
simply
haven't
gotten
very
far.
thank
you.
