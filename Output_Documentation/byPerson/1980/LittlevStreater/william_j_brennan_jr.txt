justice
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
just
ask
this?
have
you
cited
any
case
that
suggests
that
if
properly
done,
and
the
result
is
negative,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
civil
or
criminal?
justice
jr.
when
they're
negative.
justice
jr.
well,
not
even...
and
you
cite...
it's
amazing;
it's
31
years
ago...
an
opinion
of
mine
of
31
years
ago
in
new
jersey.
did
that
hold
that--
justice
jr.
--for
tetanus.
i
don't
even
recall
that.
justice
jr.
well,
if
this
opinion,
which
i
wrote
when
i
was
on
the
appellate
division
in
new
jersey--
justice
jr.
--yes;
in
1950.
didn't
that
hold...
or
did
it?
i
don't
recall,
it's
so
long
ago,
that
if
negative
that
was
decisive?
justice
jr.
it
did
hold
that?
justice
jr.
and
that
the
case
ended
there?
justice
jr.
either
civil
or
criminal?
justice
jr.
well,
who
pays
his
fee?
in
these
cases,
surely,
how
the
test
was
done
by
the
laboratory
that
did
it
and
by
whom
it
was
done,
which
has
to
be
an
expert
in
this
field,
that's
always
open
to
inquiry.
justice
jr.
who
pays
the
expense,
even
if
he
may
be
subpoenaed,
of
the
expert
witness
who
testifies
in
that
respect?
who
pays
that?
justice
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
had
a--
justice
jr.
--you
say
the
state
would
have
to
pay
the
expense?
justice
jr.
you
would
want
to
offer
the
result
of
a
blood
test?
justice
jr.
or
you
would
want
to
have
one
made?
justice
jr.
and
the
state
would
say,
well,
we're
not
so
sure
that
laboratory
does
these
things
in
the
way
they
ought
to
be
done,
and
if
you're
going
to
do
that,
you'd
better
be
prepared
to
put
on
expert
testimony
to
support
the
validity
of
the
test
and
the
method
by
which
it
was
taken.
and
then
the
expert
at
the
laboratory
says,
all
right,
for
$250
i'll
appear
in
the
courtroom.
otherwise
i
won't.
you
can't
compel
him
if
you
don't
pay
him,
can
you?
justice
jr.
well,
she
doesn't
bring
it.
the
department
of
social
services
brings
it.
justice
jr.
that's
really
the
state
of
connecticut.
justice
jr.
and
this
case
wasn't...
the
state
suffered
some
expenses
which
were
then
taxed
as
costs,
were
they
not,
against
the
appellant?
justice
jr.
that
would
happen--
justice
jr.
--so
if
the
proceeding
were
brought
in
new
haven
and
he
lived
in
hartford--
justice
jr.
--service
would
be
made
in
hartford
by
the
sheriff
of
the
county
in
which
hartford
is
located,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
and
then
this
would
call
upon
him
to
respond
in
new
haven,
appear?
justice
jr.
and
the
state
would
not
pay
his,
whatever
the
cost
would
be
from
hartford
to
new
haven?
justice
jr.
well,
more
accurately,
it's
to
shift,
it's
to
shift
the
burden
of
support
if
they
can
locate
the
father
from
the
state,
because
all
this
is,
she
doesn't
get
any
assistance
of
any
kind
if
in
fact
they
can
find
the
father
able
to
support
the
child.
isn't
that
right?
justice
jr.
otherwise,
the
mother,
to
support
the
child,
would
have
the
benefit
of
public
assistance,
wouldn't
she?
justice
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
this,
that
she
takes
the
stand,
she
said,
he's
the
father,
he's
the
father,
he's
the
father,
he's
the
father.
she
never
deviates.
he's
the
father.
he
takes
the
stand
and
says,
i
am
not,
i
am
not,
i
am
not,
i
am
not.
and
the
factfinder
believes
him
and
doesn't
believe
her,
you're
saying--
--she
wins.
--she
wins.
is
that
right?
even
though--
