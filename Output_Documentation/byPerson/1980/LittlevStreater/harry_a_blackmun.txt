justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
doesn't
your
argument
really
carry
over
to
the
other
situation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
take
a
purely
private
paternity
action,
and
if
the
blood
test
is
so
crucial
and
so
conclusive,
on
your
theory
if
the
putative
father
is
indigent,
shouldn't
the
state
pay
for
that
also?
justice
blackmun
well,
you're
taking
the
boddie
approach,
boddie
v.
connecticut.
that's
what
you
really
rely
on.
justice
blackmun
well,
my
inquiry
is
really
whether
if
we
go
along
with
you
here
we're
not
on
a
slippery
slope,
wondering
where
we
stop.
justice
blackmun
well,
that's
what
you
call
them,
but
are
they
really
civil?
justice
blackmun
let
me
ask
this.
there
is
a
judgment
here
and
support
money
has
to
be
paid.
supposing
he
doesn't
pay
it.
can
he
be
incarcerated
for
nonpayment?
is
that
a
criminal
act?
justice
blackmun
i
think
you've,
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
indicated
that
the
child
has
an
interest
in
this
litigation.
and
if
that's
so,
could
it
be
argued
that
the
state
has
the
duty
to
provide
the
best
evidence
possible?
justice
blackmun
so?
justice
blackmun
well,
here's
an
indigent
who
can't
afford
to
pay
it,
and
it
might
be
that
the
real
father
is
not
indigent.
wouldn't
the
state
be
better
off
if
they
could
locate
the
real
father?
