justice
white
we
got
on
it
in
boddie,
didn't
we?
justice
white
yes,
indeed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
state
also
require
this
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
mother,
to
get
benefits,
must
reveal--
justice
white
--the
putative
father
and
bring
action.
justice
white
you've
made
an
extensive
survey
of
these
cases,
i
note
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
you
know
the
answer
to
this.
suppose
there's
a
judgment
against
the
putative
father
in
a
case
like
this
and
there
has
been
no
blood
test.
and
he's
determined
to
be
the
father.
and
he
can't
afford
a
blood
test
or
for
some...
later
he
has
a
blood
test
and
it's
proved
that
he
isn't.
can
the
case
be
reopened
or
does
res
judicata
bar
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
limits
to
res
judicata,
when
there
hasn't
been
a
fair
trial
or
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
around
the
country,
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
say
that
every
doctor
or
technician
who,
looking
at
the
same
evidence,
the
same
comparison,
would
come
to
the
same
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
would
all
agree
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
agree
that
this
blood
is
or
isn't
the
same
as
the
other
blood?
everybody
should
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
ever
happened
in
any
of
these
cases
you've
ever
seen
where
some
incompetent
person
does
the
reading
of
the
test?
and
has
there
ever
been
a
dispute
in
one
of
these
cases
as
to
whether
or
not
the
blood
is
or
isn't
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
efforts
been
made
and
rejected
in
the
great
state
of
connecticut
to
have
public
financing
of
tests
like
this,
or
to
receive
financing
for
tests
like
these
from
some
private
sources?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
all,
there
are
only
two
states,
apparently,
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
don't
have
some
way
of
paying
the
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
there
been
proposals
in
the
state
legislature
that
have
been
rejected
or
not?
or
do
you
know?
justice
white
do
they
pay--
justice
white
--do
they
pay
for
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant?
say
an
indigent
defendant
is
sued,
does
the--
justice
white
--well,
it's
the
essay...
the
state
is
paying
the
lawyer
in
this
case,
for
the
defendant?
justice
white
and
in
any
other
case,
if
it
goes
to
contempt
proceedings,
would
the
state
insure
that
the
defendant
in
that
contempt
proceedings
which
you
say
is
a
separate
matter
has
a
lawyer?
justice
white
what
would
you
do?
just
default,
eh?
default
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
exactly
like
civil
litigation
in
a
sense
because
the
state
requires
that
this
action
be
brought.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
all
the
evidence
in
the
case...
what
if
the
judge
thinks
that
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
including
his
testimony
and
any
other
evidence
is
an
equipoise?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it's
just
evenly
balanced,
does
he
have
the
burden,
ultimate
burden
to
convince
the
judge
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
thought;
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
well,
there's
a...
i
guess
statistics
show
that
errors
have
been
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
process
would
eliminate
a
good
many
possible
errors.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
answered
me
just
exactly
the
reverse
a
little
while
ago.
i
thought
you
did,
anyway,
and
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stewart
that
way.
he
did
answer--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i'll
start
out
this
way.
at
least
his
own
testimony
is
never
sufficient
to
overcome--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
she
always
prevails,
as
long
as
he
doesn't
offer
any
other
testimony
besides
his
own?
justice
white
could
i
suggest
that
your
colleague
at
the
bottom
of
page
34
of
his
brief
cites
a
connecticut
supreme
court
case,
mosher
v.
bennett?
justice
white
and
that
quote
is
this:
"the
prima
facie
case
so
made
out.
"
--that's
by
the
plaintiff...
"places
upon
the
reputed
father
the
burden
of
showing
his
innocence
of
the
charge,
and
under
our
practice
he
must
do
so
by
other
evidence
than
his
own.
"
now,
it
says,
"the
burden
of
showing
his
innocence.
"
and
you
accept
that
as
the
law
of
connecticut?
