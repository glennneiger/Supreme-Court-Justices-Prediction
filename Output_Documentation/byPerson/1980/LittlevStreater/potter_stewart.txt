justice
stewart
in
your
statement
of
facts...
and
i
was
troubled
in
reading
the
brief
too...
i
thought
in
a
negative
way,
if
it
exonerated
putative
fathers,
it
exonerated
them
100
percent.
justice
stewart
well,
i
had
thought
that...
maybe
the
technology
has
gone
beyond
my
previous
knowledge...
but
i
had
thought
that
if
you
showed
that
the
putative,
the
accused
father
had
blood
of
a
type
different
from
the
child,
that
he
could
not
be
the
father.
justice
stewart
it's
just
impossible
for
him
to
be
the
father.
justice
stewart
but
if
he
had
the
same,
it
didn't
prove
that
he
was
or
wasn't.
justice
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
100
percent.
justice
stewart
in
any
event,
it's
conceded,
without
getting
into
the
details--
justice
stewart
--that
it's
very
probative
and
useful
evidence
in
this
kind
of
case.
justice
stewart
not
question
this;
right.
justice
stewart
expert
testimony
is
by
its
nature
and
by
definition
opinion
testimony.
justice
stewart
and
we're
not
dealing
here
with
opinion
testimony,
are
we?
justice
stewart
no.
we're
dealing
here
with
factual--
justice
stewart
--only
facts.
justice
stewart
this
isn't
a
matter
of
guilt
or
innocence,
is
it?
hasn't
connecticut
said
these
are
civil
proceedings?
justice
stewart
well,
guilt
or
innocence
has
to
do
only
with
criminal
proceedings.
justice
stewart
mr.
blue,
i
reckon
i've
interrupted
you.
earlier
i
asked
you
a
question
which
you
accepted
the
premise
of,
that
the
difference
between
this
sort
of
evidence
and
ordinary
expert
testimony
is
that
the
latter
is
invariably
opinion
testimony.
but
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
less
clear
a
line
that
is,
when
one
begins
to
think
about
handwriting
experts
and
ballistics
experts.
there
can
be
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
facts,
can't
there?
justice
stewart
is
it
more
like
fingerprinting?
justice
stewart
well,
maybe...
what
you
try
to
show
is
that
this
is
or
is
not
this
person's
handwriting,
and
that
this
bullet
was
or
was
not
fired
by
this
gun,
or
that
these
are
or
are
not
somebody's
fingerprints.
justice
stewart
my
only
thought
is
that
the
distinction
upon
which
we
agreed
a
while
ago
may
be
a
blurred
distinction.
justice
stewart
--you
can't
be
200
miles
away
in
connecticut
and
not
be
in
a
different
state.
justice
stewart
under
connecticut
law,
don't
i
remember
from
the
briefs
that
the
defendant
in
an
action
such
as
this
has
something
pretty
close
to
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
stewart
so
it's
not
just
his
burden
to
disprove
the
state's
case,
which
would
be
what
cross-examination
might
do?
justice
stewart
he
has
the
affirmative
burden
of
proof.
justice
stewart
but
doesn't
the
defendant
have
some
sort
of
an
unusual
burden
in
a
case
like
this
under
connecticut
law?
justice
stewart
i
read
these
briefs
some
time
ago--
justice
stewart
--the
case
law
begins,
discussion
of
it
begins
on
page
33
of
the
appellant's
brief,
going
back
first
to
"the
book
of
the
general
laws
for
the
people
within
the
jurisdiction
of
connecticut.
"
1673.
and
then
discussing
the
case
of
booth
v.
hart,
decided
in
1876.
town
of
chaplin
v.
hartshorne,
1825.
and
the
other
cases
discussed
there.
justice
stewart
that's
at
least
where
my
impression
came
from.
from
a
careful
reading
of
the
brief?
yes.
