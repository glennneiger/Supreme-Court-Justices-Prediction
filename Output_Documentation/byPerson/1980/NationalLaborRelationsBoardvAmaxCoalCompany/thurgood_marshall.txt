justice
thurgood
marshall
i've
been
listening
very
carefully
to
what
you
say
and
i
read
your
brief,
but
you
know
my
problem?
the
government
in
its
brief
very
carefully
points
out
legislative
history
which
says
you
are
wrong.
and
neither
in
your
brief
nor
today
have
you
pointed
to
one
piece
of
legislative
history
that
helps
you.
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall

thurgood
marshall
it's
really
not
helpful
to
you.
