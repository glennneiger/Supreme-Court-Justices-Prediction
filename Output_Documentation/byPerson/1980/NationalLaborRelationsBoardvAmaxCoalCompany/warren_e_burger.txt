we
will
turn
to
our
first
case
and
we'll
hear
arguments
in
united
mine
workers
v.
the
labor
board
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
dalton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that,
of
course,
a
trustee
represents
no
one
except
the
interests
of
the
trust.
i
take
it
you
agree
that
that's
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
a
sense,
does
not...
is
not
each
of
the
trustees,
one
appointed
by
the
union
and
one
by
the
employer,
a
representative
in
a
limited
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
combs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gruender.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
mr.
dalton,
earlier,
in
response
to
questions,
conceded
that
the
conduct
here
constituted
coercion.
is
what
you're
telling
us
that
coercion
may
never
appropriately
be
applied
to
a
trustee,
that
the
very
concept
of
a
trust
and
a
trusteeship
is
incompatible
with
being
subject
to
coercion
from
anyone
on
any
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
your
seeming
to
merge,
maybe
you
didn't
intend
to
merge
the
functions
of
the
collective
bargaining
representative
and
the
functions
of
the
trustee.
now,
it's
true
that
a
collective
bargaining
representative
has
a
fiduciary
obligation,
but
he
owes
that
obligation
just
to
one
side,
would
you
not
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute.
don't
you
think
a
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
union
owes
his
obligation
to
the
union
and
not
to
the
employer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
reaching
the
agreement.
in
coming
to
the
agreement
all
of
his
obligations
and
duties
are
to
the
people
he
represents
just
as
an
advocate
in
this
court
owes
the
obligations
to
to
his
client
and
to
the
court.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
a
trustee
of
the
fund
owes
his
obligation
to
the
totality,
does
he
not?
not
just
to
the
person
who
designated
him
but
to
the
fund
itself
and
the
purposes
of
the
fund?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now.
if
you'll
just
mention
the
case,
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
see
the
clerk
about
that?
i
think
there
is
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
