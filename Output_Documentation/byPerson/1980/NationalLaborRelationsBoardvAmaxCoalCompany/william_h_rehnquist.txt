mr.
dalton,
does
the
government
concede
that
if
the
person
in
question
here
was
a
collective
bargaining
agent
rather
than
a
trustee,
there
was
coercion
on
the
part
of
the
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
there
was
coercion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree,
mr.
combs,
with
the
proposition
that
on
occasion
under
certain
contracts
the
management
trustee
could
be
pulled
in
one
direction
and
the
union
trustee
in
another
over
a
question
as
to
the
administration
of
the
trust?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
that
would
go
to
court
or
to
arbitration
or?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
we're
talking
about
the
price
of
salvage
coal
or
the
amount,
as
justice
stevens
asked
mr.
dalton,
and
the
two
trustees
disagree
on
that,
how
is
that
answered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
the
unions
struck
to
demand
that
amax
join
the
multiemployer
group,
didn't
the
nlrb
file
an
unfair
labor
practices
charge
against
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
a
collective
bargaining
representative
as
defined
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
sit
on
a
grievance
panel,
administering
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
in
that
case
i
take
it
he
might
well
have
occasion,
as
you
have
pointed
out,
to
vote
against...
if
he's
the
management
representative,
he
might
nonetheless
vote
against
one
of
his
fellow
managers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
dated
april
21,
filed
in
the
clerk's
office.
is
that
in
time?
