if
that's
your
argument--
--well,
of
course,
it
would
turn
out
to
be
exactly
the
same,
whether
or
not
that
was
correct,
wouldn't
it?
that's
right.

the
trustee
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
representative.
justice
stewart
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
stewart
well,
certainly,
the
chief
justice
is
correct
that
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
itself,
before
the
agreement
is
reached,
or
alternatively
in
the
processing
of
a
grievance
under
the
agreement,
a
collective
bargaining
representative
owes
his
exclusive
and
undivided
loyalty
to
either
the
union
or
the
employer?
the
person
he
represents.
justice
stewart
the
association
or
person
whose
agent
he
is.
justice
stewart
like
any
agent?
justice
stewart
but
he
is
not
then
acting
as
collective
bargaining
agent.
justice
stewart
he
can
wear
two
hats
but
he
can't
wear
them
both
at
once,
as
we
said
earlier.
justice
stewart
there
are
two.
there
are
two
of
them.
justice
stewart
that
wouldn't
be
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining.
