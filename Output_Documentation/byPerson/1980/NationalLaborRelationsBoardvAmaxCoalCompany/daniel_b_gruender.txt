mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
and
the
section
of
the
statute,
section
8(b)(1)(b)
has
been
before
this
court
before.
this
particular
case
involves
several
key
concepts
in
the
whole
system
of
our
free
collective
bargaining
system.
but
one
of
the
first
ones
is...
which
is
contained
in
section
9(a)
of
the
act...
and
it's
emphasized,
of
course,
in
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
decision,
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
assure
to
employees
the
fullest
freedom
of
the
exercise
of
their
rights
to
collective
bargaining,
unit
by
unit.
belle
ayr
mine
is
a
separate
unit,
always
has
been
a
separate
unit,
never
been
part
of
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association.
another
key
concept
in
our
free
collective
bargaining
system
is
that
the
parties'
representatives
will
be
free,
that
they'll
be
dependent,
that
one
party
cannot
be
compelled
to
have
accepted
or
forced
on
him
a
representative
whose
interests
he
feels
are
adverse
or
for
whom
they
cannot
act
in
even
a
fair
way.
there
are
interplay
of
many
other
concepts
in
the
labor-management
area
that
enter
into
this
case,
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
we're
talking
about
fiduciary
duties.
there
are
many
statutes
involved
and
i
know
that
you've
got
a
lot
of
them
laid
out
before
you
and
you
can
come
to
judgment
yourself
on
them.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--a
separate
bargaining
unit
as
to
amax
coal--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--is
a
member
of
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
i
did
not.
my
client
may
have.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
the
way
it...
somebody
was
a
representative
of
the
bituminous
coal
operator's
association.
whether
they
were
represented--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--whether
they
were
at
the
time
that
they
joined
the
bcoa
or
not,
i
don't
know
that.
i
really
don't.
the
bcoa
trustees
were
preselected
and
designated.
i
don't
know
if
they
were
preselected
and
designated
at
the
time
amax
became
a
member
of
the
bcoa.
that's
not
a
matter
of
the
record
in
this
case,
sir.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
my
client,
amax
coal
company,
is.
the
belle
ayr
unit--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--well,
i'm
sure
that
the
trustee
was
selected
by
bcoa.
i
don't
know
whether
our
client
was
a
member
at
that
time
or
not,
and
the
record
doesn't
disclose
that.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
yes,
sir?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
even
if
i'm
right?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
no,
because
the
act
dictates
and
guarantees
to
the
parties
unit-by-unit
bargaining.
there
is
no...
and
it
contravenes
the
requirements
of
the
act
and
the
whole
policies
of
collective
bargaining
for
one
unit
to
be
able
to
force
on
another
unit
a
representative
or
participation
in
a
multiemployer
trust
that
is
basically
the
product
of
multiemployer
bargaining.
in
the
particular
case
involved
with
belle
ayr,
belle
ayr
was
contesting,
that
unit
was
resisting
an
effort
to
be
forced
into
another
bargaining
unit
for
whatever,
for
lack
of
a
better
description
was
entitled,
the
peabody
group,
which
was
another
separate
multiemployer
bargaining
unit.
that
strike
commenced
at
belle
ayr.
the
board
found...
this
is
undisputed
in
the
record.
it's
not
an
issue
before
you,
but
it
is
a
fact.
since
the
other
parties
have
gone
into
some
of
the
preliminary
facts,
i
suppose
there's
no
harm
in
shedding
light
on
this
part
of
it.
the
major
issue
in
that
strike
that
commenced
was
the
strike
by
the
union,
the
united
mine
workers,
to
compel
amax
to
participate
in
the
peabody
group.
now
the
reason
that
amax
did
not
participate
in
the
peabody
group,
multiemployer
bargaining,
was
because
the
peabody
group
would
not
listen,
was
not
willing
to
entertain
an
alternative
pension
proposal,
which
amax
knew
would
be
cheaper
for
itself,
half
the
cost,
essentially,
of
what
the
mine
workers'
plan
was,
better
benefits,
and
with
the
same
or
better
affordability;
on
that
basis.
and
that
was
one
of
them.
there
were
other
areas
where
the
bargaining
group
was
adverse,
or
at
loggerheads,
or
adverse
to
the
interests
of
amax.
and
incidentally,
that's
a
key
point
in
bargaining,
too.
i
think
that
what
the
government
and
what
the
union
have
totally
ignored
here,
and
it's
not
brought
on
the
record,
is
that
bargaining
is
a
matter
of
compromise,
that
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
as
we
see
it
is
not
black
and
white.
when
the
parties...
negotiation
is
defined,
collective
bargaining
is
defined
in
section
8(d)
of
the
act;
it
involves
a
negotiated
agreement
or
any
question
arising
thereunder.
that's
where
you
get
the
grievance
and
arbitration,
adjustment
of
grievances
provision
of
our
national
labor
laws.
for
example--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--well,
the
employer
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
issued
a
complaint.
eventually
that
complaint
was
found
to
be
meritorious
by
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
union
struck
to
force
amax
into
that
"peabody
group"
or
other
multiemployer
unit.
now,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothesis
that
you
might
want
to
compare,
because
it's
keyed
to
the
understanding
of
what
collective
bargaining
is,
and
you
must
make
a
determination
on
that
issue,
and
if
you
are
to
determine
if
an
8(b)(1)(b)
representative
and
a
trust
representative
or
an
employer's
representative
on
the
trust,
is
engaged
in
collective
bargaining.
we
must
understand
the
process.
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
can
be
roughly
divided
into
two
basic
categories.
one,
where
you're
negotiating
to
obtain
an
agreement
or
to
fashion
an
agreement.
once
that
agreement
is
fashioned,
collective
bargaining
does
not
end.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
then
get
into
the
grievance
and
arbitration
process
which
has
been
sometimes
called
the
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
continue
and
in
a
multiemployer
type
of
bargaining
situation
the
employer,
quite
often
there'll
be
what
we
call
joint
grievance
procedures.
that
is
to
say,
the
employer
representative,
the
union
representative,
will
sit
on
a
grievance
panel,
and
one
of
the
employers
who
is
a
member
of
that
bargaining
unit,
multiemployer
bargaining
unit,
will
come
in,
he's
been
violating
the
agreement.
the
management
representative
and
the
union
representative
may
be
sitting
in
judgment
on
a
management
representative,
and
sometimes
the
management
representative
votes
against
the
other
management
representative.
and
vice
versa,
for
the
union.
the
process
of
collective
bargaining,
that's
the
adjustment
of
grievances,
has
been
undisputedly
and
uniformly,
where
a
multiemployer
bargaining
situation
arises
and
the
employer
objects
to
joint
resolution
of
grievances
by
a
multiemployer
group
and
says,
look,
they
aren't
collective
bargaining
representatives,
they're
adjusting
grievances
concerning
the
interpretation,
application,
and
meaning
of
this
agreement.
we
don't
want
them
to
do
that,
and
says,
we're
not
going
to
do
that.
the
board
will
automatically
find
them
to
be
8(b)(1)(b)
representatives
and
not
force
the
employer
to
accept
joint
resolution
of
grievance
committees.
on
the
other
hand,
the
process
of
administering
a
trust,
once
it's
negotiated...
and
that's
done
at
the
table,
negotiating
the
trust,
in
this
case
some
of
it's
done
by
the
trustees,
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
or
pointed
out
other
sections
of
the
trust,
where
they
actually
engage
in
negotiations
or
creation
of
provisions
of
the
so-called
contract
or
agreement.
but
once
that
trust...
or,
it's
just
like
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
trust
is
incorporated
word
for
word
into
the
agreement.
the
trustees
are
authorized,
specifically,
under
the
agreement,
to
interpret,
apply,
and
adjust,
and
settle
its
terms.
literally
do
what
the
collective
bargaining
representatives
do
with
grievances.
well,
anyway,
once
that
occurs,
the
normal
collective
bargaining
process
of
settling
disputes
that
arise
concerning
the
meaning
and
application
or
the
interpretation
of
a
question
arising
under
an
agreement
is
what?
it's
normally
through
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
culminating
in
the
compulsory
arbitration.
that's
so
commonplace
in
our
lexicon
of
labor
law
that
everybody
just
accepts
it.
the
very
same
process
occurs
on
a
trust
fund.
when
the...
and
remember
the
statutory
choice
is
deliberate
here.
congress
was
aware
of
compromise
being
an
essential
ingredient
of
collective
bargaining.
congress
had
many
options
available
to
set
up
trust
funds.
they
chose
the
compromise
between
labor
and
management
and
they
also
chose
the
same
collective
bargaining
methods
of
adjustment
that
they
foster
in
that
act.
for
example,
they
said,
instead
of
just
establishing
a
separate
organization
we're
going
to...
in
order
to
make
sure
the
union
does
what's
right,
we're
going
to
subject
them
to
the
conflict
that
occurs
sometimes
between
labor
and
management.
that's
the
best
way
to
insure
to
employees
the
best
deal.
i'll
get
into
that
in
just
a
minute
because
it's
very
crucial,
it
seems
to
me,
to
understand
the
advantage
to
the
employees.
in
other
words,
i
believe
one
of
the
myths
here
is
that
people
are
thinking
that
the
sole
benefit
of
the
employees
will
never
be
taken
care
of
by
the
employer
or
the
union,
and
that
for
some
reason
the
employer
is
always
trying
to
undermine
the
union
or
the
employees
and
vice
versa.
that's
not
true.
the
key
factor
with
most
employers
is,
once
the
agreement
is
made,
is
to
make
sure
it's
enforced,
and
that
the
beneficiaries
of
the
agreement
get
the
best
of
it.
and
there
are
quite
often
reasonable
men
disagreeing
over
what
is
the
best
way
to
do
it,
are
both
looking
out
for
the
best
interests
of
the
beneficiaries.
insisting
that
employees
get
paid
the
highest
wages
in
our
country
is
not
always
good
for
the
employees,
as
they
sometimes
find
themselves
priced
out
of
the
market
and
gone.
so
an
employer
who
resists
what
appears
to
be
a
liberal
wage
demand
may
in
fact
be
benefiting
the
rest
of
the
beneficiaries,
the
employees,
in
helping
save
the
business.
the
same
thing
is
true
for
an
unwarranted
claim
on
a
trust.
if
an
employer
representative
resisted,
or
a
union,
he
may
be
in
fact
preventing
a
wage,
the
assets
or
corpus
of
the
trust,
for
other
beneficiaries.
the
interests
of
all,
sometimes,
are
not
necessarily
served
by
making
a
liberal
interpretation
of
the
fund
so
that
it
pays
out
things
without
regard
to
what
were
the
basic
assumptions
when
it
was
started.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
just
as
in
the
instance
where...
and
i
think
the
law
is,
that
just
as
in
the
instance
where
a
union
cannot
strike
to
compel
an
employer
to
agree
to
joint
grievance
arbitration
procedures
or
joint,
in
a
multiemployer
bargaining
context,
that
same
reason
exists
to
justify
that
he
cannot
be
struck
or
coerced
to
select
as
a
trustee
someone
who
he
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
have
confidence
and
trust
in.
now,
once
the
distinction...
there's
a
distinction
you've
got
to
make,
because
they're
polevaulting
over,
the
government,
the
union...
once
an
employer
agrees
to
engage
in
multiemployer
bargaining,
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
say,
then,
if
we'd
have
joined
the
bcoa...
i
don't
have
a
right
to
then
say
the
president
of
bcoa
will
be
myself,
or
my
law
associate
here
or
somebody
else.
i
don't
have
a
right
to
select
who
that
representative
is.
but
once
i
commit
to
the
joint
bargaining,
once
an
employer
commits
to
a
multiemployer
trust,
and
the
cases
are
legion
on
that,
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
stand
above
all
others
and
select
who
the
trustees
are
going
to
be.
but,
just
like
in
the
situations
of
the
joint
grievance
procedure...
the
teamsters
are
the
most
familiar
kind
of
thing,
tripartite
kind
of
a
joint
grievance
procedure...
once
an
employer
says,
i'm
not
going
to
agree
to
joint
bargaining,
then
it
completely
defies
the
whole
federal
policy
and
it
subverts
it,
of
unit
by
unit
bargaining,
to
say
to
him
that
he
has
to
then
put
up
with
multiemployer
trusts.
remember,
multiemployer
trusts
do
not
exist
outside
of
multiemployer
bargaining.
they
are
a
creature
of
it.
the
issue,
the
cardinal
issue
in
this
case
before
the
parties
was,
will
i
be
compelled
to
be
bound
by
a
bargaining
group,
which
does
not
represent
their
interests?
in
this
case
it
wasn't
even
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees,
if
that's
the
touchstone
of
collective
bargaining.
what
are
the
things
they
say
about,
what
are
some
of
the
myths
about
multiemployer
trusts?
they
say
they're
cheaper
for
the
employers.
they
say
they're
better
benefits.
they
also
say
that
they're
more
portable.
there's
less
liability
for
the
employers.
none
of
those
are
true
today.
amax--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
you
mean
on
the
basis
that
it
wasn't
as
good?
that
was
the
thing
that
moved
them
to
that
point,
but
also
the
interests
of
bcoa
trustees
as
opposed
to
the
interests
of
the
employees
at
belle
ayr
were
adverse.
there
was
no
way
that
the
belle
ayr,
that
the
bcoa
trustees
could
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
belle
ayr
employees.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
where
he
agrees
to
participate...
and
the
cases
on
that
are
clear...
once
you
agree
to
participate
in
multiemployer
bargaining,
you
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
designate
who
the
representative--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--well,
on
the
contrary--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--no,
no.
there
are
permissive
subjects--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--the
issue
before
this
court
is,
are
these
people
collective
bargaining
representatives
or
not?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
and
if,
in
fact...
and
they
say
that...
30
percent
of
our
compensation
package
in
this
country
today
is
fringe
benefits...
and
if
they
say,
and
we
all
agree,
that
fringes,
fringe
benefit
funds
are
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining,
and
so
are
wages,
hours,
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
which
are
handled
by
joint
grievance
representatives
at
a
joint
grievance
procedure
under
a
multiemployer
trust.
but
it
is
very
clear
that
the
law
does
not
permit
the
union
to
strike
to
force
the
employer
to
select
as
his
representative
to
be
bound
by
the
representatives
in
a
joint
grievance
procedure.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
the
issue
here
is--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--what's
the
difference?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
yes.
they
claim
that
the
union
is
entitled
to
strike
the
employer
to
force
him
to
be
bound
by
the
representative
of
a
multiemployer
trust--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--no,
but
there
is
a
provision
in
the
law
that
it
is
not
right
for
a
union
to
strike
to
compel
someone
to
select
as
their
representative--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--someone
who
cannot--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--no,
that
is...
the
point
is
not,
whether
you
win.
if
it's
a
matter
of
winning
or
losing,
as
you
so
aptly
have
pointed
out,
our
client
has
stood
their
ground.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
encourages
bargaining.
there
are
other
employers
who
are
not
as,
perhaps
as
resolute
as
our
client,
and
were
able
to
persevere
in
the
pressure
that
they
were
subjected
to.
the
question
is
if
what
the
trustees
do
is
essentially
the
same
thing
in
administering
the
terms,
adjusting
the
grievances
under
the
trust
agreement,
or
as
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
in
fact
setting
a
contribution
level,
what
collective
bargaining
representatives
do,
why
is
it
fair
to
say
that
they
cannot
strike
to
force
you
to
accept
the
bcoa
representatives
as
your
grievance
representatives,
but
it
is
okay
to
be
bound
by
another
bargaining
unit's
representatives
who
also
do
the
same
thing
for
something
that
accounts
for
only
30
percent
of
the
wage
package?
so,
what
we're
saying
is
that...
what
we're
really
saying
in
our
argument
is
that
the
duties
of
collective
bargaining
representative
and
the
duties
of
trust
fund
representative...
remember
to
look
at
the
language
in
the
statute.
this
is
not
just
by
chance
they're
called
employer
representatives,
employee
representatives;
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
instead
of
it's
calling
a
third
person
as
an
arbitrator,
he's
called
the
neutral.
the
parties
recognize
the
conflict
inherent.
incidentally,
in
a
multiemployer
bargaining--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--well,
in
erisa
it
merely
reemphasizes
what
in
fact
the
common
law
was
with
respect
to
302(c)
trusts
before
and
codifies
them.
and
it
also
recognizes
the
fact
of
life
that
practically
all
of
the
trustees,
most
of
them,
in
a
multiemployer
situation
are
in
fact
the
collective
bargaining
representatives,
so
that's
fine,
there's
no
problem
with
that.
and
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
a
person
being
a
fiduciary
and
a
bargaining
representative.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
other
statutes
they
have
to
to
be,
the
union
has
to
be.
what's
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
the
day
has
gone
when
we
can
look
at
a
union
representative
as
some
big
monster
who's
only
interested
in
union
goals.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
so
do
collective
bargaining
representatives.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
he
had
them
before,
sir.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
they
are
collective
bargaining
duties,
in
our
opinion.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
erisa
doesn't
impose
collective
bargaining
duties.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
the
national
labor
relations
act
defines
collective
bargaining
duties
and
the
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
302(c)(5).
now,
nedd
v.
mine
workers
clearly
stated
that
erisa
did
nothing
more
than
codify
what
302(c)(5)
and
the
common
law
of
trusts
provided
prior
to
that--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--so,
our
point
is
that
the
conflict
that
they
say
exists
between
employer
and
union
representatives.
i
think
one
of
the
points
the
briefs
makes,
i
think,
that
the
employer
might
have
to
make
a
judgment
about
another
employer
and
there'd
be
a
conflict
of
interest.
that
happens
all
the
time
in
collective
bargaining,
that
an
employer
passes
judgment
on
another
employer,
particularly,
only,
in
multiemployer
bargaining.
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
that
at
all.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
no,
i
do
not
agree
at
all.
for
example--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--at
what
point?
after
an
agreement
is
reached
or
thereafter?
once
it's
reached
he
holds
an
obligation
to
make
sure
the
terms
and
provisions
of
that
agreement
are
carried
out.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
a
bcoa
collective
bargaining
representative
has
the
same
obligation
to
all
of
the
members
of
the
association...
the
union,
to
all
the
members
of
the
union...
as
he
would
if
he
were
a
trustee.
now,
as
far
as
the
exclusivity,
is
the
collective
bargaining
representative
like
a
lawyer?
i
don't
think
so.
the
law
is
much
more
complex
on
that.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
before
an
agreement
is
reached?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
subject
to
the
law--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--subject
to
all
the
requirements
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
some
of
which
impose
obligations
on
the
employer's
representative
to
watch
out
for
the
interests
of
the
employers.
that's...
black
and
white.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
can
a
collective
bargaining
representative?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
yes.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
in
the
multiemployer
situation
they
do
it
every
day.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
he
is.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
sir.
when
a
management
representative
sits
on
a
joint
grievance
panel
and
an
employer
comes
before
him,
another
employer,
a
competitor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
comes
before
him
and
he
has
to
now
decide,
did
this
man
fire
this
man
unlawfully
or
did
he
not,
many
times
employer
representatives
have
voted,
based
on
the
facts,
they
become
like...
unions
and
management
in
those
situations
become
like
umpires
and
they
vote,
well,
yeah,
we
believe
he
violated
the
contract,
he
fired
him
without
just
cause,
or
he
didn't
pay
him
the
right
wages
on
the
thing,
and
he'll
vote
against
the
management
person.
that
happens
every
day
in
collective
bargaining.
they
are
collective
bargaining
representatives
and
nobody
questions
it.
and
they
are
doing
what
they
believe
to
be
their
duty,
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
once
the
parties
reach
agreement,
to
say
that
the
union
doesn't
have
any
conflict
among
its
members
is
to
ignore
reality.
sometimes
the
employees
are
fighting
and
the
poor
union
would
like
to
have
the
employer
decide
the
question
instead
of
being
involved
with
a
conflict
between
their
members:
who
gets
which
job?
let's
say
these
trustees
are
sitting
there
and
there's
$10
to
spend
for
new
benefits.
half
of
the
membership
want
a
dental
plan;
another
one
wants
vision;
another
one
wants
major
medical;
and
another
one
wants
additional
maternity.
and
the
union
business
agent
would
rather
have
a
management
man
make
that
decision.
he
doesn't
want
to
go
back
to
the
union
hall
and
listen
to
the
union
people
complain
about
how
he
didn't
do
a
thing.
in
other
words,
they
have
conflicts.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
well,
the
legislative
history,
in
my
opinion,
we
didn't
address
that
because
i
don't
think
the
legislative
history
is
dispositive,
or
i
don't
believe
it's
that
conclusive.
i
think
it--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--i
think
it
suggests
certain
things
but
you've
seen
legislatures
come
and
go,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
that's
not
it;
really.
i
don't
believe
it's
helpful
to
them.
i
don't
think
it
says
what
they
think
it
means.
i
don't
think
that
something
dropped
out
of
a
passage
in
congress
is
that
significant,
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
particular
legislation
and
the
specific
statutory
language
that
was
used.
the
section
of
the
act,
501(3)
that
says,
the
term
2;
the
clear
delineation
of
the
employer
and
employee
representatives
have
a
specific
meaning,
at
least
to
employer
and
employee
representatives;
and
the
use
of
the
term
"neutral".
now,
that
means
that
somebody
has
a
flavor
to
them,
or
a
bias,
if
you
will.
now,
what
i
mean
to
say,
and
one
of
the
myths
here,
is
that...
and
i've
pointed
it
out,
it's
not
in
the
suit...
they
say
that
the
destruction
of
multiemployer
trusts
will
come
about
as
a
result
of
this.
all
we
can
say
is
that
that's
just
simply
not
true.
for
example,
if
this
particular
union
wished
to
maintain
the
same
program,
it
could
have
gone
to
the
bargaining
table
and
insisted
that
the
employer
put
up
a
duplicate
fund,
not
with
the
same,
with
the
representatives,
but
with
the
employers'
representatives,
and
could
have
offered
reciprocity
to
give
them
the
portability,
it
could
have
offered
the
same
benefits
and
could
have
struck
for
that
and
there
would
have
been
no
violation
of
the
law
in
our
opinion.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
they
insisted
on
forcing
him
into
another
bargaining
unit,
a
bargaining
unit
which
in
fact
has
a
long
history...
i
need
not
cite
authority
for
it...
of
disruptions,
labor
disputes,
which
have
caused
problems
with
those
funds...
that
not
only
does
an
injustice
to
the
belle
ayr
employees,
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
those
disputes
and
disruptions
and
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
them
through
the
grievance
or
arbitration
procedure
or
any
other
way,
it
just
does
violence
to
the
whole
procedure
of
bargaining
unit
by
unit.
no
destruction
of
collective
bargaining
is
going
to
come
about
as
a
result
of
this
position.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
multiemployer
trusts
will
stand
or
fall
on
their
ability
to
provide
to
the
employees
whom
they
cover,
and
to
the
employers
that
they
serve,
what
they
hold
themselves
out
to
do,
which
is
better
benefits
at
less
cost,
with
the
same
amount
of
portability.
that,
frankly,
they
have
had
a
lot
of
favored
treatment
in
law.
forty-year
amortization
schedules
as
opposed
to
30,
no...
very
seldom
are
they
covered
with
termination
insurance.
so
they've
had
a
little
different
set
of
rules
to
play
with
and,
frankly,
many
of
the
employers
have
been
able
to
develop
better
programs
for
their
employees
at
less
cost.
now,
there
is
no
reason
in
god's
world
that
i
can
see
or
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
reason
or
logic
to
require
employers
to
be
subjected
to
demands
that
they
have
representatives
determining
those
fringe
benefits,
or
be
compelled
to
accept
the
strike,
or
take
a
strike,
on
an
issue
like
that
when
those
people
stand
almost
on
the
same
footing,
in
terms
of
function,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
labor
laws,
as
an
8(b)(1)(b)
representative
who
is
adjusting
the
grievances
concerning
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
they
struck
the
bcoa?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
and
i
represent
the
bcoa?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
the
union
did
that?
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
that's
their
view
of
the
law.
i
think
they're
dead
wrong.
i
think
the
law
doesn't
support
that
kind
of
a
demand.
i
think
that
when
you
understand
what
the
trustees
do,
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
between
having
fiduciary
obligations
and
being
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
and
erisa
said
so.
and
incidentally,
in
vaca
v.
sipes,
the
miranda
case,
demonstrate
that
collective
bargaining
representatives
literally
are
living
by
fiduciary
standards.
they
have
to.
and
the
employer
likewise.
times
are
changing.
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
them
having
both
types
of
functions
and
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
beneficiaries
in
the
process,
and
the
best
interests
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
process
might
be
fighting
the
union
on
a
particular
claim
which
may
not
have
merit,
and
that
may
be
the
best
interests
of
the
beneficiaries
because
it
would
avoid
a
wasting
of
the
assets,
a
destruction
of
the
actual
assumptions,
for
example,
on
which
the
trust
was
based,
so
that
the
rest
of
the
beneficiaries
would
have
a
benefit.
but
the
board's
error,
in
our
opinion,
is
best
evidenced,
and
the
union's
error
is
the
same,
is
they
confuse
the
thing.
look
at
footnote
12
on
page
20
of
their
brief,
where
they
state
that...
they
mix
up
the
fact
that
fringes
are
a
mandatory
subject
and
they
said,
well,
since
the
trustee
representative
is
involved
in
that,
that's
a
mandatory
subject
too.
that's
just
like
saying,
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
are
a
mandatory
subject
and
the
collective
bargaining
representative
who
determines
the
wages
and
hours
and
working
conditions
is
the
same.
i
draw
your
attention
to
a
case
which
i
did
not--
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
--the
case
is
sinai
hospital.
incidentally,
i
heard
a
comment
here
about
a
reply
brief.
i
never
received
a
reply
brief
from
the
government.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
i
have
not
received
it,
so
i
am
unable
to
answer
you.
i
have
seen
a
reply
brief
from
the
union
and
i've
hit
most
of
their
arguments.
mr.
daniel
b.
gruender
i
have
not
seen
the
government's
brief.
if
there
is
a
reply
brief
from
them,
that's
news
to
me.
