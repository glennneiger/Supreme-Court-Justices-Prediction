mr.
dalton,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
remember
reading
somewhere
in
the
briefs
that
the
trustees
of
this
fund
had
the
power
to
set
the
royalty
rates
on
salvage
coal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
i
gather
is
a
method
of
determining
how
much
is
contributed
to
the
trust
funds
by
the
employers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
extent
that
they
have
the
power
to
determine
the
level
of
contributions
by
the
employers,
are
they
not
determining
a
matter
which
would
normally
be
subject
to
collective
bargaining?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
an
open-ended
provision
saying
the
trustees
shall
determine
from
month
to
month
how
much
the
employer
shall
contribute
to
the
fund.
would
they
then
be
representatives
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
royalties
on
the
salvage
coal.
but
why...
you
say
it's
not
significant
that
that's
limited
to
salvage
coal?
you're
saying,
even
if
they
had
an
open-ended
power
to
fix
the
contribution
rate,
they'd
still
not
be
representatives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
they
were
to
determine
the
hours
of
work
on
which
royalties
would
be
paid
or
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
what
point
do
they
become
representatives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
they're
doing
that
as
even
with
the
smaller
item
of
royalty
rates
on
salvage
coal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
the
trust
instrument
gave
them
the
power
to
adjust...
to
make
a
term
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
in
effect
it
does
when
it
says,
how
much
money
shall
be
contributed
to
the
fund?
that's
normally
in
the
agreement
rather
than
in
the
trust
instrument.
they
are
getting...
it
seems
to
me
they're
getting
bargaining
power.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
employer
here
doesn't
want
his
royalty
rate
set
by
either
the
trustees
selected
by
the
employees
or
or
by
the
compulsory
arbitrator
selected
by
them.
in
either
event,
is
not
that
person
doing
something
that
the
employer
would
like
to
have
his
own
representative
have
a
voice
in?
isn't
that
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
dalton,
didn't
amax,
as
to
its
membership
on
the
multibargaining
unit,
did
have
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
this
trustee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
argument
is,
not
that
this
is
not
a
representative,
but
he's
not
being
compelled
to
take
a
representative
he
didn't
have
a
voice
in
selecting.
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
the
entire
trust
were
financed
by
royalties;
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
assume
it
all
was
and
the
trustees
had
the
power
to
decide
what
the
royalty
rate
on
coal
would
be,
would
it
be
$5
or
$10
a
ton,
they
would
determine
the
entire
economic
burden
on
the
employers
of
the
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you're
right,
then
that's
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
the
point
on
the
royalty
coal
is
that
that's
a
relatively
small
item
in
the
total
picture?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
were
a
big
item,
it
would
clearly
be
a
subject
that
would
be
bargained
out,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record...
oh,
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down,
if
i
may.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there
have
ever
been
any
disagreements
on
the
royalty
rate
on
the
salvage
coal
which
have
had
to
be
referred
either
to
the
arbitrator
or
perhaps
back
to
the
parties
for
clarification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
it's
a
formula
that's
well
known
to
the
parties
and
their
agreement
may
in
effect
be
interpreted
as
having
accepted
that
as
a
proper
approach?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gruender,
may
i
interrupt
just
a
second?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
issue
is
whether
it's
appropriate
to
bargain
over
whether
you
can
join
a
multiemployer
trust.
you
would
object
to
the
trust
even
if
you
had,
even
if
you
could
appoint
the
employer
trustee,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
a
reason
why
you
don't
want
to
participate
in
the
multiemployer
trust.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
totally
independent
of
who
the
trustee
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
there
are
many
multiemployer
trusts
in
which
one
employer
is
not
necessarily
a
member
of
the
employer
association
that
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
particular
trust?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gruender,
you
haven't
really
argued
this,
but
i've
just
been
reflecting
on
your
argument
a
little
bit.
supposing
you
represented
bcoa
instead
of
just
one
operator
and
the
union
said
to
bcoa,
we
want
you
to
designate
john
l.
lewis,
jr.,
as
the
employer
trustee
on
the
fund.
under
your
view,
that's
essentially...
and
then
they
struck
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
bcoa,
just
say,
i
want
to
pick
my
own
representative,
and
they
say,
no,
no,
we
want
john
l.
lewis,
jr.,
or
somebody
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
union
did
it.
if
the
union
did
that,
under
their
view
of
the
law,
he
would
not
be
a
representative
and
that
would
be
a
perfectly
proper
strike,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dalton,
would
you
respond
to
the
question
i
put
to
your
opponent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
moment
or
two
ago?
could
the
union
strike
against
an
association
and
say,
we
want
you
to
designate
mr.
x
as
the
employer
trustee
on
the
pension
fund?
justice
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
if
they...
what
they'd
do
is
say
we
want
the
employer
to
select
a
trustee
from
the
following
list,
but
the
employer
can
make
the
selection
and
he
will
be
the
employer
trustee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
violate
the
provision
that
prohibits
the
union
from
trying
to
designate
the
employer's
collective
bargaining
representative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
arises
as
a
violation
of
whatever
statute
it
is
that
says
the
union
cannot
try
to
coerce
the
employer
into
selecting
a
representative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
would
he
be
a
representative
for
purposes
of
that
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
be
mandatory,
it
would
be
permissive.
it
isn't
even
permissive
if
the
man
is
a
representative.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
union
could
say,
to
avoid
your
suggestion
that
he
would
become
a
union
representative,
say
the
union
just
said,
we
will
not,
we
insist
that
you
do
not
appoint
mr.
x,
the
man
you
had
before.
he's
been
a
pest
in
all
our
negotiations;
we
don't
want
him
on
the
trust
fund.
they
could
do
that,
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
violating
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
they
always
take
the
highest
possible
rate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
surely
would
be.
i
think
you
shouldn't
have
climbed
back
into
that
pit.
