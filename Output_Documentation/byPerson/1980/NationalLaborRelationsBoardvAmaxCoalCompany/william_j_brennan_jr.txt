mr.
dalton,
may
i
ask
one
thing?
justice
jr.
i
gather
the
belle
ayr
mine
was
not
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
unit
in
connection
with
which
the
original
trust
fund
was
set
up.
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
the
belle
ayr
mine
was
not?
justice
jr.
and
the
demand
of
the
union
was
that,
nevertheless,
the
contributions
to
the
pension
fund
be
made
to
the
trustees
set
up
under
a
different
unit
than
this.
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
and
there's
no
question
of
the
legitimacy
of
that
demand
and
that
it
is
the
subject
of
mandatory
bargaining?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
mr.
dalton,
am
i
wrong?
i
thought
that
amax
did
have
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
this
particular
trustee
through
bcoa,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
mr.
gruender,
may
i
ask
a
moment,
am
i
right
that
you
do
have
representative
in
multibargaining
set-up
through
bcoa
of
which,
as
i
understand
it,
your
client's
a
member?
justice
jr.
i
know,
but--
justice
jr.
--but
the
fact
is,
the
fact
is
that
you
did
have
a
voice
in
the
selection
of
the
trustee
through
bcoa,
did
you
not?
justice
jr.
your
client
did.
well,
it
did,
not
"may
have".
well,
somebody
did.
justice
jr.
of
which
your
client
was
a
member.
justice
jr.
no,
but
the
fact
is
that
your
client
is
a
member
of
bcoa?
justice
jr.
and
that
there
is
a
trust
fund
of
which
one
of
the
trustees
was
selected
by
bcoa?
justice
jr.
well,
now,
assume
with
me
for
a
moment
that
it
was,
and
it
had
a
voice
in
the
selection.
justice
jr.
even
if
you're
right--
justice
jr.
--even
if
you're
right
that
the
trustee
selected
by
bcoa
also
is
a
collective
bargaining
agent,
then
you
do
have
a
collective
bargaining
agent
administering
the
fund,
don't
you?
justice
jr.
i
understand
what
the
issue
is...
i
know
what
the
issue
is--
