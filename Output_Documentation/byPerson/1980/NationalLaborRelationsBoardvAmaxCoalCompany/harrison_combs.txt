mr.
harrison
combs
mr.
chief
justice;
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
our
position
that
the
3rd
circuit's
decision
holding
that
a
management-appointed
trustee
is
a
collective
bargaining
representative
jeopardizes
collective
bargaining
relationship
between
the
employer
and
employee
in
the
coal
industry.
and
further,
that
if
this
is
upheld,
that
it
could
lead
to
the
extinction
of
multitrust
funds
in
the
coal
industry.
i
think
it's
just
a
bit
ironic
that
this
situation
grew
out
of
a
strike
in
the
coal
industry
in
1947
in
which
john
l.
lewis
was
demanding,
among
other
things,
that
the
operators
contribute
to
the
union
certain
amounts
based
upon
the
royalty
of
coal
produced
for
the
purpose
of
health
and
retirement
funds
to
the
union.
the
congress,
the
sponsors
of
302(c),
stated
that
there
was
a
danger
that
if
these
contributions
were
paid
to
the
union,
to
john
lewis,
at
that
time,
as
they
were
saying,
that
they
could
be
diverted,
and
that
they
could
lead
to
war
chests
on
the
part
of
the
union
for
purposes
other
than
payment
to
beneficiaries
and
participants
in
these
funds.
therefore,
the
congress
in
enacting
302(c)
insulated
these
contributions
from
the
control
of
the
union
by
the
method
of
providing
that,
in
the
first
place,
under
the
contract,
that
the
funds
would
have
to
be
the
subject
of
a
written
agreement
in
the
contract
on
which
they
were
going
to
pay,
and
for
what
purposes
they
were
going
to
be
used.
the
congress
further
specified
in
302(c)
the
benefits
that
could
be
paid
from
these
funds.
it
provided
an
equal
balance
of
the
trustees
to
be
administered
by
the
employer,
the
operator,
and
the
union,
by
having
a
representative
on
the
board
of
trustees.
this
has
been
in
effect
for
the
past
31
years.
to
my
knowledge
it
has
not
been
challenged
on
this
basis
that
the
3rd
circuit
has
adopted
in
this
case
by
any
court
in
this
country.
the
labor
board's
opinion
and
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
on
behalf
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
my
opinion
is
very
correct.
to
my
mind,
if
the
trustee
is
a
bargaining
representative
of
the
appointing
employer
or
union,
that
would
lead
to
the
administration
of
these
funds
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
unfair
labor
practices,
which
i
think
has
been
in
one
court,
at
least,
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
a
claimant
for
benefits
under
the
fund
took
the
position
that
the
union
had
not
fairly
represented
him
as
a
trustee
of
the
fund
and
therefore
that
he
was
wrongfully
denied
a
pension
that
he
should
have
been
delivered.
that
case
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
miniard
v.
lewis.
the
court
rejected
that
argument
and
he
said,
no.
the
court
said,
no,
that
these
trustees
had
the
fiduciary
obligation
to
represent
the
beneficiaries
and
the
participants.
and
that
was
a
sole
obligation
on
their
part.
and
i
might
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
argument
between
the
beneficiary
or
the
claimant,
was
between
the
trustees
and
not
between
an
employer,
as
would
be
the
case
of
adjusting
a
grievance.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes.
i'll
agree
that
that
could
occur,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
would
be
in
the
context
these
trustees
would
be
bound
by
the
trust
agreement
that's
required
under
302(c),
and
they
would
have
to
adjust
as
a
fiduciary,
they
would
have
to
adjust
the
disputes
between
them
based
upon
their
obligation
that's
specified
in
the
trust
agreement.
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
under
the
way
that
these
trust
agreements,
it
does
not
go
to
arbitration,
it's
a
final
judgment
of
the
trustees
on
the
eligibility
that's
specified
in
the
trust
agreements
of
that
kind.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
would
be
answered
by
the
third
trustee
as
provided
for
in
section
302(c).
the
two
trustees,
appointed
by
the
employer
and
the
union,
have
the
right
to
select
the
third
trustee,
and
the
third
trustee,
that's
a
balancing
under
the
act
itself.
so
that
is
my
point,
that
under
erisa,
which
is
encouraging
multibargaining...
there's
a
preamble
in
that...
and
the
common
law
of
trust
administration,
that
these
trustees,
even
in
the
salvage
coal
that
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
about,
that
that
is
an
administrative
problem.
it's
refuse,
it's
a
slate
dump,
and
the
trustees
are
authorized
because
it's
just
a
question
of
determining
how
much
coal,
related
to
regular
coal
mining,
may
be
in
that
slate
dump.
now,
if
there's
a
disagreement
between
the
two
trustees
or
the
three
trustees...
and
i
might
say
this,
that
the
neutral
trustee,
supposedly
neutral,
whatever
he
is,
he
gets
ahold
of
these
things
too.
it's
an
administrative
act.
it
certainly
isn't
bargaining.
mr.
harrison
combs
it's
partly,
both.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
that
assumption
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
many
of
these
operators
don't
agree
to
any
such
thing
as
that.
the
bargaining--
mr.
harrison
combs
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining
but--
mr.
harrison
combs
--yes.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes.
but
i
might
point
out,
mr.
justice
stevens,
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
this
trust
fund
was
set
up
in
1974.
it
was
in
operation.
it
was
in
compliance
with
302(c).
now,
amax
said,
look,
we've
got
a
better
deal
for
our
people
than
you've
got
in
that
fund.
we'll
give
them
more
benefits.
that's
their
strenuous
argument.
it's
a
strange
argument
that
the
employer's
be
arguing
that
what
i'm
offering
is
better
than
what
the
union
is
asking
for,
but
that
was
it.
both
of
them
were
placed
on
the
table,
they
bargained
that
out,
amax
would
not
agree
to
it.
they
never
did
agree
to
it.
they
broke
the
strike,
and
they
still
haven't
agreed
to
it.
that's
collective
bargaining.
now--
mr.
harrison
combs
--sure.
to
follow
your
point
hypothetically
to
its
total
conclusion,
i
think
that
if
they
agreed
to
that
and
set
it
up
in
conformance
to
the
act,
that
the
trustees
would
have
fiduciary
obligation
to
bargain
that
they
have
to
carry
out,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
courts
have
said
that
if
it's
set
up
in
conformity
with
302(c),
that
because
it's
been
set
up
prior
to
new
operators
coming
in,
that
that
is
in
violation
of
the
act.
now,
i
might
point
out
this,
that
this
multiemployer
fund,
the
bcoa
had
about
160
companies
at
this
time,
we
have
over
2,000
independent
companies
that
bargain
to
go
into
that,
and
we
are
constantly
having
them
coming
in
and
going
out
in
this
industry.
and
to
set
up
a
forum
that
would
be
total
at
the
beginning
of
the
contract,
it
just
wouldn't
be
practical.
because
we've
got
new
companies
coming
in
and
we
don't
get
these
kind
of
arguments,
and
what
we're
saying,
that
these
funds
are
balanced,
that
they
were
paid
under
302(c),
and
that
these
trustees...
sorry,
but
my
time
is
up.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
might
say
this
for
the
information,
mr.
justice
stevens,
of
you
and
the
court:
i
am
a
trustee.
to
my
knowledge
there's
been
no
dispute.
there's
a
formula
that
was
adopted
years
ago
with
the
trustees
and
they
still
follow
that.
it
has
to
do
with
btus
and
stuff
of
that
character,
and
it's
related
to
whether,
to
how
many
btus
in
there.
they
take
that
average
of
btus
in
the
industry,
and
it's
just
a
salvage
proposition.
mr.
harrison
combs
that
is
correct.
to
my
knowledge,
it's
been
in
there
for
many
years.
mr.
harrison
combs
thank
you.
