mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
3rd
circuit.
two
petitions
were
filed,
one
by
the
united
mine
workers
and
a
second
on
behalf
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
should
add
that
the
department
of
labor,
which
administers
erisa,
is
not
a
party
in
this
proceeding
but
concurs
in
the
views
presented
by
the
labor
board.
the
question
presented
in
both
cases
is
whether
a
management-appointed
trustee
of
a
jointly
administered
taft-hartley
trust
fund
is
a
collective
bargaining
agent
within
the
meaning
of
section
8(b)(1)(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
forbids
unions
from
coercing
employers
in
the
selection
of
their
collective
bargaining
representatives.
in
practical
terms,
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
union
may
strike
as
part
of
its
effort
to
induce
an
employer
to
contribute
to
a
multiemployer,
as
distinct
from
a
single
employer,
pension,
or
welfare
fund.
now,
although
the
dealings
between
amax
coal
company
and
the
union
in
this
case
were
rather
complex,
the
facts
that
relate
to
the
sole
issue
that's
before
this
court
are
rather
straightforward.
amax
coal
company
mines
coal.
it
does
so
primarily
in
the
midwest
and
in
deep
shaft
bituminous
mines.
it
bargains
with
the
umw
through
the
bituminous
coal
operators
association
with
respect
to
its
midwest
operations.
now,
in
1972,
amax
coal
company
opened
its
first
surface
strip
mine
in
gillette,
wyoming,
called
the
belle
ayr
mine,
and
that's
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
amax
did
not
negotiate
through
the
bcoa
in
connection
with
the
belle
ayr
mine
but
instead
entered
into
a
separate
agreement
with
the
mine
workers
that
was
patterned
on
the
bcoa
contract.
and
pursuant
to
that
independently
negotiated
contract
amax
contributed
to
the
union's
national
multiemployer
pension
and
welfare
funds.
in
january
of
1975,
at
the
expiration
of
that
belle
ayr
contract
and
the
expiration
of
several
other
western
surface
mine
contracts,
the
union
struck
the
belle
ayr
mine
and
the
mines
of
other
western
coal
operators.
the
following
month,
in
february,
the
union
and
amax
began
negotiations
over
the
belle
ayr
mine
but
they
reached
an
impasse
in
march
and
in
mid-march...
i
think,
march
17...
amax
resumed
operations
at
the
mine
under
its
last
contract
proposal.
over
the
course
of
the
next
year
the
parties
engaged
in
sporadic
negotiations
but
no
agreement
was
ever
reached
between
them.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
now,
among
the
sticking
points
which
led
to
the
impasse
was...
and
there
were
several,
but
there's
only
one
that's
before
this
court
today...
was
amax's
refusal
to
continue
to
contribute
to
the
multiemployer
pension
and
trust
funds.
those
funds
were
set
up
pursuant
to
section
302(c)(5)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
the
taft-hartley
act,
and
provide
for
comprehensive
health
and
retirement
benefits.
those
funds
are
administered
pursuant
to
that
section
by
three
trustees,
one
appointed
by
the
union,
one
appointed
by
management,
and
the
third
trustee
to
be
appointed
by
the
other
two.
at
the
time
the
negotiations
between
amax
and
the
union
began
over
the
belle
ayr
mine,
the
trustees
were
already
appointed,
the
trust
funds
were
set
up,
and
the
trustees
were
engaged
in
the
active
administration
of
them.
now,
while
acknowledging
that
the
union's
trust
fund
proposals
were
mandatory
subjects
of
collective
bargaining,
amax
took
the
position
that
the
management-appointed
trustees
were
collective
bargaining
representatives
and
that
therefore
the
union's
insistence
to
impasse,
the
union's
striking
in
an
effort
to
induce
the
company
to
contribute
to
those
trust
funds
constituted
a
violation
of
section
8(b)(1)(b).
and
that's
because
the
trustees
were
already
selected
at
the
time
negotiations
took
place.
amax
filed
an
unfair
labor
charge
with
reference
to
this
issue.
they
filed
other
charges
but
they
are
not
before
the
court.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
that
is
correct.
well,
the
belle
ayr
mine
was
not;
that's
correct.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
right.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
the
trustees
of
one
of
the
national
pension
and
welfare
funds;
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
no
one
has...
in
fact,
that
issue
was
fairly
foreclosed
by
the
opinion
of
this
court,
i
think
written
by
you,
in
allied
chemical
&
alkali
workers.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
and
the
board
rejected
amax's
contention
and
concluded
that
trustees
are
not
collective
bargaining
representatives.
the
board
stated
that
trustees
are
"solely
fiduciaries
owing
undivided
loyalty
to
the
beneficiaries.
"
of
the
trust.
a
two-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
and
pro
tanto
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
in
a
nutshell,
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
taft-hartley
trustees
to
function
as
agents
for
either
unions
or
employees
while
engaged
in
the
administration
of
a
trust;
that
trustees
cannot
do
so
without
violating
duties
imposed
upon
them
both
by
the
common
law
and
by
erisa:
and
that
taft-hartley
trustees
do
not
in
practice
engage
in
collective
bargaining.
now,
these
arguments
are
laid
out
in
our
briefs,
and
i
don't
intend
to
elaborate
on
them
here
unless,
of
course,
the
court
wishes
otherwise.
instead
i
propose
to
address
my
remaining
time
to
three
considerations.
one,
the
meaning
of
the
term
302(c)(5).
second,
the
equal
representation
provision
of
that
section,
what
it
means,
what
it's
designed
to
accomplish,
and
how.
and
third,
some
of
the
legal
and
institutional
consequences
of
the
decision
below.
if
all
goes
according
to
plan,
my
colleague
of
this
side
of
the
podium
will
address
the
impact
of
the
decision
below
on
multiemployer
funds,
and
particularly
on
the
funds
at
issue
in
this
case.
i
note
at
the
outset
that
the
term
"representative"
is
not
a
term
of
art.
it
has
no
fixed
meaning
within
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
as
this
court
unanimously
observed
in
united
states
v.
ryan,
one
justice
not
participating,
the
terms
"representative"
and
"collective
bargaining
representative"
are
not
synonymous.
amax
argues
that
representative
refers
to
persons
who
advance
the
interests
of
the
parties
that
appoint
them.
that
construction
however,
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
section
302's
requirement
that
contributions
be
held
in
trust
and
that
they
be
held
in
trust
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
trust
beneficiaries.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
absolutely;
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it's
our
position
that
they
represent
those
parties,
that
the
limitations
of
that
representation
are
such
that
in
any
instance
in
which
the
interests
of
the
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
might
possibly
conflict
with
the
interests
of
the
beneficiaries,
then
the
former
must
recede,
and
therefore
it's
inappropriate
to
consider
them
as
collective
bargaining
representatives
because
the
latter
owe
an
undivided
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
parties
that
they
represent.
it's
our
position,
it's
the
common
law,
that
trustees
must
eschew
the
interests
of
third
parties,
that
they
owe
a
sole
primary
exclusive
obligation
to
trust
beneficiaries.
that's
also...
erisa
has
codified
the
common
law
and
has
essentially
made
those
principles
matters
of
federal
statute,
and
therefore
the
most
that
can
be
said
of
the
term
representative
as
used
in
this
section
302(c)(5)
is
that
it
means,
in
effect,
designee;
refers
to
the
fact
that
trustees
are
appointed
by
unions
and
employers.
so
the
next
question
is,
to
what
end?
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
appointment
of
trustees
by
employers?
and
in
particular,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
equal
participation
rule,
that
for
every
trustee
appointed
by
a
union
there
must
be
a
trustee
appointed
by
an
employer?
now,
it
is
common
ground
that
this
equal
participation
rule
was
one
of
a
set
of
strictures.
the
requirement
that
contributions
be
made
into
a
formal
trust
is
another,
set
up
by
taft-hartley
to
deter
unions
and
union
officials
from
misusing
and
misappropriating
pension
and
welfare
funds.
however,
there's
a
serious
division
among
the
parties
with
respect
to
how
that's
to
be
achieved.
it's
our
position
that
by
their
mere
presence
employer-appointed
trustees
serve
to
check
potential
pension
abuses.
furthermore,
by
participating
in
the
actual
workings,
administration
of
the
trust,
trustees
are
in
a
position
to
discover
and
ferret
out
abuses
and
to
take
whatever
steps
are
appropriate,
including
the
commencing
of
lawsuits
for
breach
of
fiduciary
responsibilities.
thirdly,
because
they
are
equal
in
number
to
the
union-appointed
trustees,
the
management
trustees
are
in
the
position
to
block
any
efforts
by
their
colleagues
to
advance
the
union's
interest.
none
of
these
steps
requires
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
exclusive
obligation,
exclusive
duty
of
loyalty
that
trustees,
management-appointed
and
union-appointed
alike,
owe
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
in
marked
contrast,
the
3rd
circuit
conception
of
how
this
watchdog
provision
is
to
operate
is
premised
on
the
trustees'
exhibiting
at
best
divided
loyalties.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
trustees
of
a
taft-hartley
trust
are
"expected
to
advance
the
interests"
of
the
appointed
parties.
the
court
took
the
position
that
this
advancing
of
private
party
interest
or
third-party
interest
was
"essential
to
the
operation
of
section
302(c)(5).
"
and
that
the
clash
of
party
interests
creates
"a
distilling
process
which
would
provide
safeguards
against
trust
fund
corruption.
"
now,
whether
or
not
this
approach
would
root
out
corruption,
we
submit
that
it
would
have
the
inevitable
collateral
consequence
of
undermining
orderly
administration
of
trust
and
of
fostering
pursuits
and
interests
that
are
alien
to,
or
in
any
event,
not
congruent
with
the
interest
of
trust
beneficiaries.
this
ongoing
collective
bargaining
within
the
administration
of
the
trust,
as
the
court
of
appeals
termed
it,
would
lead
to
frequent
stalemates,
broken
either
by
resort
to
arbitrators,
compulsory
arbitration,
which
i
might
notice
are
contrary
to
the
way
we
normally
think
of
collective
bargaining,
or
impasses
broken
by
horse
trading
in
which
concessions
on
trust
issues
might
well
be
exchanged
for
concessions
on
non-trust
issues.
now,
that
compromise
or
subordination
of
the
interest
of
trust
beneficiaries
is
but
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
decision
below.
in
addition,
the
introduction
of
collective
bargaining
considerations
into
the
day-to-day
administration
of
trust
would
have
the
effect
of
injecting
the
national
labor
relations
board
into
the
routine
matters
of
trust
administration.
whenever
a
disappointed
party,
be
it
a
beneficiary
of
the
trust
or
a
trustee,
concluded
that
one
of
the
trustees
had
failed
to
engage
in
good
faith
collective
bargaining,
then
that
person
would
be
entitled
to
file
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
an
unfair
labor
practices
charge.
and
so,
contrary
to
the
scheme
that
was
set
up
by
congress
in
which
section
302
of
taft-hartley
is
reserved
to
the
courts,
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
assume
jurisdiction
over
the
administration
of
trust
funds.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
with
respect
solely
to
refuse
or
salvage
coal.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
but
they
would
do
that
by
virtue
of
the
agreement
of
the
parties
during
collective
bargaining.
in
other
words,
that
provision
which--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--i
would
submit
not.
that's
obviously
a
more
difficult
case
than
that
presented
here
in
which
every
one
of
the
rates
of
contribution
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
set
in
the
contract,
except
for
refuse
or--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--they
still
would
not
be
collective
bargaining
representatives,
so
they
would
indeed
obviously
be
engaged
in
the
setting
of
those
rates.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
then
we
begin--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--that's...
at
that
point
i
begin
to
worry
because
at
that
point,
and
maybe
even
at
some
point
prior
to
that,
they're
engaged
in
brokering
the
relationship
between
employers
and
employees,
which
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
collective--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--except
that
one
of
the
other
hallmarks
of
collective
bargaining
representatives
is
that,
is
that
what
they
are
negotiating
around
is
the
contract.
i
take
it
that
in
your
hypothetical
the
trustees
would
be
making
those
judgments
in
connection
with
administering
the
trust
instrument,
or
at
least
the
trust
funds.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
a
third
distinction
between
bargaining
parties
and
trustees
is
that
when
the
former
reach
impasse,
they're
entitled
to...
at
least,
if
we're
talking
about
issues
that
are
mandatory
bargaining
issues,
they're
entitled
to
resort
to
their
economic
weapons,
strike,
lockout,
et
cetera,
whereas
under
section
302(c)(5),
when
trustees
reach
an
impasse,
either
that
impasse
is
broken
by
neutral
trustees,
if
such
exist,
or
the
trustees
are
entitled
to
themselves
appoint
a
compulsory
arbitrator
or
to
ask
the
district
court
to
do
so.
and
i
take
it,
under
your
hypothetical,
that
if
the
trustees
were...
to
accept
the
trustees
are
empowered
to
set
royalty
rates
for
salvage
coal,
any
disputes
would
be
resolved
by
compulsory
arbitration,
and
that's
a
different
mechanism,
at
least,
than
this
typical
collective
bargaining.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
well,
i
just
have
a
couple
of
responses.
at
the
point
that
the
trustees
would
be
reappointed,
amax
at
least
theoretically
could
have
a
voice
in
selecting
the
employer
trustees.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
in
fact,
amax...
yes...
that's
precisely...
amax...
number
one,
amax
did
select
these
trustees
in
connection
with
this
deep
shaft
bituminous
mine--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--i
did
concede
that
there
was
coercion,
but
not
for
all
time.
the
point
that
i
began
to
make
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
was
that
the
51
percent,
employers
representing
51
percent
of
the
contributions
are
entitled
to
select
the
employer-appointed
trustees,
so
there
might
come
a
time
in
which
amax
could
ally
with
other
employers
and
select
a
trustee.
second--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes,
it
would.
moreover,
we
note
that--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--yes.
moreover,
we
note
that
amax
did
not
have
to
agree
to
this
particular
provision
or
any
other
provision
of
the
union's
proposal
in
the
course
of
this
collective
bargaining,
as
we
stress
in
our
reply
brief.
the
duty
to
bargain
is
not
an
obligation
to
agree.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
i
just
have
three
quick
points,
actually
four.
with
respect
to
the
reply
brief,
i
take
it
it
was
served
in
the
ordinary
course
and
i
can't
really
say
more
than
that.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
it
was
one
week
before
today.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
want
to
clarify
my
concession
with
respect
to
coercion.
that
concession
is
limited
to
the
acknowledgement
that
striking
to
induce
an
employer
to
contribute
to
a
pension
fund
where
the
trustees
have
already
been
selected,
that
that
strike
is
in
a
sense
coercion,
but
certainly
i'm
not
conceding
that's
a
violation
of
section
8(b)(1)(b)
or
that
in
this
case
the
union
was
attempting
to
coerce
amax
to
participate
in
multiemployer
bargaining.
that
confusion
of
multiemployer
bargaining
and
participation
in
a
multiemployer
trust
fund,
i
think,
is
something
that--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
for
two
reasons.
first,
in
my
mind,
that
trustee,
that
suggested
trustee
by
the
union
could
well
be
characterized
as
a
union
trustee
and
would
thus
violate
the
balancing
of
employer-appointed
and
union-designated
trustees
required
by
section
302(c)(5).
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
that's
my
second
point.
yes,
that
would
be
a
permissive
subject
and
therefore
the
employer
would
not
be
obligated.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
yes.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
no,
he
wouldn't
but
nevertheless
the
union's
demand
would
not
be
a
mandatory
subject
for
collective--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--well,
my
point
clearly
is
the
man
is
not
a
representative
for
purposes
of
section
8(b)(1)(b)
so
then
the
question
is,
as
it
is
here,
assuming
that
the
trustees
are
not
collective
bargaining
representatives,
then
the
question
is,
whether
or
not
the
union
demand
is
a
mandatory
or
permissive
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
if
mandatory,
then
the
employer
must
take
its
part.
if
not,
then
the
employer
need
not.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
my
position
is
that
the
union
could
make
that
request
or
demand,
but
the
employer--
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
--without
violating
section
8(b)(1)(b);
that
the
employer
need
not
accept
it
and
that
the
union
would
not
be
entitled
under
the
act
to
bargain
to
impasse
or
strike
over
that
issue.
that's
the
distinction.
i
have
one
other
response,
which
is
to
your
earlier
question
about
salvage
rates,
though
i
wonder
why
i
want
to
climb
back
in
that
pit.
but,
to
the
extent
that
trustees
are
authorized
to
determine
royalty
rates,
they
must
do
so
in
the
interest
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
and
not
in
order
to
advance
the
interests
of
either
the
employer
or
the
union.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
if
that's
in
the
interest
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
mr.
harlon
l.
dalton
i've
got
the
red
light.
i'm
going
to
sit
down.
thank
you.
