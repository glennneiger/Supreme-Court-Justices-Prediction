justice
rehnquist
well
wasn't
the
first
question
at
least,
all
but
resolved
in
the
sweeney
case?
justice
rehnquist
the
fifth
circuit
here
equated
the
articulation
of
a
non
discriminatory
reason
with
proof
by
a
preponderance
which
i
would
have
thought
the
sweeney
case
was
contrary
to.
justice
rehnquist
well
doesn't
it
simply
shift
the
burden
of
proof
back,
in
this
four
stage
procedure
outlined
in
mcdonnell,
so
that
then
the
plaintiff
has
to
say
no
the
reason
you
articulated
is
no
good
or
wasn't
the
real
reason?
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
certain
inconsistency
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
at
page
a-11
of
the
petition
where
the
court
says
in
the
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
"defendant
may
refute
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case
by
articulating
a
legitimate
non
discriminatory
reason
for
the
rejection.
"
ibid.
"this
court
requires
defendant
to
prove
non
discriminatory
reasons
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
"
if
articulate
means
anything
other
than
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
hasn't
the
fifth
circuit
kind
of
melded
together
the
two?
justice
rehnquist
well
mr.
gill,
don't
you
think
there's
a
certain
inconsistency
between
the
two
sentences
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
that
i
read
your
opposing
counsel,
where
it
says
defendant
may
refute
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case
by
articulating
a
legitimate,
non
discriminatory
reason
for
the
rejection
and
then,
this
court
requires
the
defendant
to
prove
non
discriminatory
reasons
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
rehnquist
but
now
isn't
that
contrary,
mr.
gill,
to
the
very
language
in
sweeney,
on
page
24,
where
we...
the
court
said
"while
words
such
as
articulate,
show
and
prove
may
have
more
or
less
similar
meanings
depending
upon
the
context
in
which
they
are
used,
we
think
there
is
a
significant
distinction
between
merely
articulating
some
legitimate
non
discriminatory
reason
and
proving
absence
of
discriminatory
motive?
"
justice
rehnquist
but
you
would
agree
that
it
means
something
less
than
proving
the
absence
of
a
discriminatory
motive?
justice
rehnquist
but
then
aren't
you
still
saying
that
he
has
to
prove
non
discrimination
rather
than
simply
articulate
a
reason?
justice
rehnquist
then
what
do
you
do
with
sweeney?
justice
rehnquist
it
was
a
per
curiam
opinion,
i
think.
justice
rehnquist
but
he
said
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
this
case
involves
only
steps
1
and
2
in
mcdonnell,
and
that
steps
3
and
4
were
never
brought
into
play?
justice
rehnquist
well
what
if
the
trial
court
in
the
hypothesis
you
just
gave,
on...
contrary
to
its
conclusion
as
you
stated,
said
the
plaintiff
has
produced
ten
witnesses,
the
defendant
had
simply
testified
himself,
but
i
believe
the
defendant
and
not
the
ten
witnesses
of
the
plaintiff
and
therefore
i
enter
judgment
for
the
defendant.
now
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
that,
unless
the
appellate
court
were
to
say
the
finding
were
clearly
erroneous?
