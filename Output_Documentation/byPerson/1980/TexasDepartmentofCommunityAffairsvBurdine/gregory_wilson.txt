mr.
gregory
wilson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
title
vii
sex
discrimination
case
in
which
two
issues
are
presented
to
the
court
for
resolution.
first,
what
burden
is
placed
on
the
defendant
in
a
title
vii
case
after
the
plaintiff
establishes
a
prima
facie
case?
is
it
a
burden
to
merely
establish
or
to
articulate
legitimate
non
discriminatory
reasons,
or
is
it
a
burden
to
come
forward
and
prove
reliance
upon
those
reasons
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
second
question
for
resolution
is--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--that
is
our
contention,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
completely
misconstrued
the
sweeney
case
and...
in
the
sweeney
case,
the
issue
on
appeal
was
whether
the
defendant
had
to
prove
that
there
was
an
absence
of
discriminatory
motive.
i
personally
don't
believe
that
there's
any
difference
between
that
burden
of
proof
and
proving
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
reliance
upon
non
discriminatory
reasons.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir,
it
was
exactly
contrary
to
it.
and
we...
the
texas
department
of
community
affairs
won
this
case
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
partially
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
issue.
they
determined
that
because
we
had
merely
articulated
the
reason
and
not
proved
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
we
had
failed
to
rebut
the
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir,
your
honor,
not
by
myself.
mr.
gregory
wilson
well
the
author
of
the
opinion
was
judge
gee.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
gregory
wilson
the
second
question
for
review
is
the
standard
upon
which
a
district
court
finding
in
a
title
vii
case
of
either
a
discriminatory
motive
in
the
employment
decision
or
the
lack
of
a
discriminatory
motive,
what
standard
is
that
to
be
reviewed
under.
is
the
appellate
court
to
undertake
an
independent
review
of
the
evidence
or
is
it
to
accept
the
district
court's
finding
unless
it's
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
ms.
burdine
was
hired
by
the
texas
department
of
community
affairs
in
january
of
1972
as
an
accounting
clerk
and
was
quickly
promoted
to
a
coordinating
role
in
the
division,
in
the
public
service
careers
division,
with
some
supervisory
responsibilities.
she
worked
under
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
mr.
mark
nealy,
who
was
the
project
director
of
the
public
service
careers
division.
nealy
quit
in
october
of
1972
and
was
not
replaced.
and
during
the
ensuing
year
from
january
of
'72
when
ms.
burdine
was
hired
until
the
following
april
of
'73,
when
she
was
fired,
there
developed
a
certain
amount
of
dissension
among
ms.
burdine
and
two
other
employees
in
the
division,
mr.
roberto
carraveo
and
marian
kirkland.
the
public
service
careers
division
was
wholly
funded
by
the
united
states
department
of
labor
and
in
february
of
1973,
the
department
notified
the
executive
director
of
the
texas
department
of
community
affairs,
mr.
b.
r.
fuller,
that
funding
for
the
program
would
cease
due
to
inefficiencies
in
its
administration.
and
they
specifically
noted
that
there
was
a
failure
of
fiscal
controls
in
the
division,
that
there
had
been
improper
documentation
of
expenditures,
overstaffing
and
questionable
eligibility
of
some
of
the
enrollees
in
the
program.
mr.
fuller
drafted
a
response
to
the
agency,
to
the
department
of
labor,
and
convinced
them
to
continue
funding
the
program
provided
that
certain
steps
were
taken
to
clear
up
the
problems.
in
particular,
he
was
required
to
hire
a
new
permanent
project
director
and
to
reorganize
and
reduce
the
staff.
in
april
of
1973,
mr.
fuller
hired
a
new
project
director,
he
terminated
ms.
burdine
along
with
the
two
other
employees
who
had
been
involved
in
the
dissension
in
the
division
and
retained
mr.
alan
walz
who
had
previously
been
supervised
by
ms.
burdine
but
was
now
promoted
to
the
coordinating
role
which
she
had
previously
held.
now
the
state
concedes
that
ms.
burdine
established
a
prima
facie
case
merely
by
showing
that
she
was
fired
from
her
position
and
that
she
was
replaced
by
a
male.
this
is
not
a
very
demanding
level
of
proof,
but
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test,
most
of
the
steps,
the
four
steps
in
establishing
a
prima
facie
case
are
pretty
well
satisfied
when
a
person
is
already
being
employed
by
an
agency
and
is
then
fired.
however,--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--that's
right,
in
this
case,
right,
and
a
male
was
hired
in
this
case
to
fill
the
vacancy
when
she
was
fired.
mr.
gregory
wilson
right.
however,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
furnco
case,
a
prima
facie
case
is
not
equivalent
to
a
factual
finding
that
discrimination
took
place
in
the
employment
decision.
what
the
prima
facie
case
does
is
merely
eliminate
the
two
most
common
reasons
for
an
employment
decision,
the
two
most
common
legitimate
reasons
which
are
that
the
applicant
was
not
qualified
for
the
job
or
that
there
was
not
a
vacancy
in
the
position
at
the
time
that
he
applied.
mr.
gregory
wilson
we're
not
faced
with
that
in
this
case.
because
we
did
articulate
evidence
into
the
record
through
testimony.
i--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--i
understand
the
question.
we...
i
think
that
in
your
concurrence
in
the
sweeney
case,
that
the
fact
that
an
employee
of
the
agency
testifies
as
to
the
reasons,
i
believe
that
that's
articulation.
now,
i
think
that
you
could
go
a
step
further;
i'm
not
sure
the
court
would
be
willing
to
go
this
far,
and
say
that
the
mere...
merely
by
establishing
a
prima
facie
case
what
the
plaintiff
does
is
create
a
fact
question
which
in
certain
negligence
cases
would
allow
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
would
be--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--that's
right.
mr.
gregory
wilson
well
it
would
seem
to
me
that
at
that
point
there
would
be
at
least
a
strong...
i
think
that
what
you've
done
is
create
a
fact
question
and
the--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--preponderance
of
the
evidence
would
be
probably
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
if
there
was
no
evidence
adduced
by
the
defendant.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir,
the
way
i
interpret
the
case,
is
what
it
creates
when
the
defendant
gets
up
there
and
articulates
a
reason
that
the
plaintiff's
evidence
in
rebuttal
of
that
articulated
reason
does
not
have
to
specifically
address
that
articulated
reason.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
gregory
wilson
we're
just--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--we're
quoting
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case,
your
honor.
i
would
feel
that
the
testimony
by
mr.
fuller
in
this
case
certainly
satisfies
the--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--yes
sir.
mr.
gregory
wilson
i
think
they
have...
the
plaintiff
has
to
go
on
and
say
that,
and
as
you
all
are
well
aware,
the...
in
the
trial
court
that's
not
the
way
the
case
is
going
to
develop.
it's
a
rule
of
analysis
more
than
it
is
a
rule
of
procedure.
mr.
gregory
wilson
your
honor,
it
seems
that
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
done
is
shifted
the
burden
in
this
entire
case--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--that
the
defendant
has
to
prove
that
he
relied
upon
a
legitimate
reason
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
gregory
wilson
by,
he
has
to
show
the
existence
of
a
legitimate
reason
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
limit
or
how
you
would
weigh
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
when
someone
says
that
dissension
was
a
legitimate
reason
for
what
happened,
for
the
employment
decision.
i
think
that
everyone
would
concede
that
dissension
is
a
legitimate
reason
and
proving
the
dissension
is
a
legitimate
reason
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
does
not
really
make
any
sense.
so
the
only
issue--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--the
employee
would
also
know,
if,
in
the
case
of
dissension
for
example.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
you
can't
prove...
the
only
way
you
can
prove
that
dissension
is
a
legitimate
reason
is
to
prove
that
the
employee
was
involved
in
dissension.
mr.
gregory
wilson
they
said
one
and
then
they
said
the
other,
yes,
your
honor.
because
of
the
difficulty
that
a
plaintiff
encounters
in
attempting
to
prove
discrimination
in
the
employment
context,
what
this
court
did
in
mcdonnell
douglas
was
to
say
that
if
you
can
eliminate
there
two
most
common
legitimate
reasons
then
the
defendant
will
have
to
come
forward
and
tell
you
why
he
fired
you,
for
instance,
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
normally
you
would
expect
that
that
would
happen
in
the
discovery
stage
of
the
trial.
the
plaintiff
would
discover
the
reason
that
the
defendant
fired
him,
or
that
he
did
not
hire
him.
and
then
would
be
able
to
bring
out
evidence
at
trial
that
those
reasons
were
not
the
real
reasons
for
the
employment
decision.
in
this
case,
the
texas
department
of
community
affairs
articulated
two
reasons
for
the
decision
with
regard
to
ms.
burdine,
through
the
testimony
of
mr.
fuller.
and
those
were
ms.
burdine's
partial
responsibility
for
the
problems
in
the
public
service
careers
division
pointed
out
by
the
department
of
labor
and
her
partial
responsibility
for
dissension
in
the
division.
since,
under
the
fifth
circuit's
burden
of
proof,
if
a
plaintiff
comes
forward
with
his
prima
facie
case
and
then
the
defendant
is
unable
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
actually
relied
upon
legitimate
non
discriminatory
reasons
then
the
plaintiff
automatically
wins
the
case,
because
there
has
been
a
failure
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case.
this
completely
eliminates
the
last
step
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test
which
is
the
step
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
allowed
to
come
back
and
show
that
the
articulated
reasons
by
the
defendant
are
pretextual.
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir.
there's
nothing
left
for
the
plaintiff
to--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
gregory
wilson
if
the
defendant,
if
he
proves
that
he
relied
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
then
there's
nothing
left
for
the
plaintiff
to
show;
if
he
fails
to
prove
it,
there's
still
nothing
left
for
the
plaintiff
to
show
because
he's
failed
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case.
mr.
gregory
wilson
i
hadn't
addressed
that,
but
i
think
that
he
satisfied...
i
think
that
the
way
i
would
address
that
under
the
district
court's
finding
that
there
had
been
no
discrimination--
mr.
gregory
wilson
--sir?
mr.
gregory
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
gregory
wilson
i
guess
it
would
be.
mr.
gregory
wilson
that's
essentially
what
they
did,
yes,
your
honor.
the...
that
brings
me
to
the
next
step
in
my
argument,
which
is
that
the
finding
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
there
was
not
discrimination...
i
mean,
excuse
me,
of
the
district
court
that
there
was
not
discrimination
in
this
employment
decision,
was
not
clearly
erroneous
because
it
was
supported
by
that
testimony
by
mr.
fuller.
and
the
fifth
circuit
improperly
intruded
upon
the
fact
finding
authority
of
the
district
court
when
it
undertook
an
independent
review
of
the
evidence
in
which
it
credited
some
of
the
evidence
of
the
plaintiff
and
discredited
some
of
the
evidence
of
the
defendant.
and
this
is
kind
of
a
fact
question,
the
motivation
for
an
employment
decision
which
the
district
courts
are
required
to
decide
on
a
daily
basis
in
the...
for
instance
in
the
mount
healthy
case,
first
amendment
cases,
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
alleging
that
he's
been
fired
for
making
a
first
amendment
speech.
and
the
district
court's
finding
in
this
instance
that
sex
discrimination
was
not
the
motivating
factor
for
the
decision
to
fire
ms.
burdine,
should
have
been
accorded
the
deference
that
a
fact
finding
is
due
by
the
appellate
court
and
it
should
have
been
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
for
that
reason,
as
well
as
the
failure
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
apply
the
proper
burden
of
proof,
i
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
reinstated.
mr.
gregory
wilson
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
district
court
did
specifically
find
that
ms.
burdine
was
involved
in
the
dissension
in
the
division
on
page
a3
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
sentence
begins
"the
three
individuals
who
were
terminated,
plaintiff,
carraveo
and
kirkland
did
not
work
well
with
each
other
and
had
some
disagreements
and
in
light
of
the
department
of
labor's
concern
about
a
lack
of
communication
within
the
staff
and
other
considerations,
it
was
certainly
a
rational
decision
for
the
defendant
to
terminate
those
parties.
"
the...
once
the
defendant
has
articulated
reasons,
what
he
has
essentially
done
is
he's
created
a
fact
question
as
i
think
the
court
has
begun
to
realize,
that
the...
and
the
district
court
is
at
that
time
empowered
to
rule
in
either
direction.
if
the
defendant
fails
to
articulate
a
reason,
then
the
prima
facie
case
would
require
the
district
court
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
once
the
defendant
has
gotten
on
the
stand
and
testified
that
he
had
another
reason,
there's
a
fact
question
and
it
should
not
be
reversed
by
the
appellate
court
unless
it
was
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
thank
you.
