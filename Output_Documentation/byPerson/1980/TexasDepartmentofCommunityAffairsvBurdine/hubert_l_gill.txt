mr.
hubert
l.
gill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
initially
i
would
speak
on
the...
just
briefly
to
the
fact
issue
raised
by
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
he
said
that
there
was
proof
in
the
record
that
the
plaintiff
joyce
ann
burdine
was
involved
in
dissension
within
the
agency
and
that
there
was
proof
that
she
was
at
least
partially
responsible
for
some
deficiencies
in
the
program.
i
believe
a
close
review
of
the
record
will
indicate
that
the
only
evidence
of
that
in
the
record
whatsoever
was
mr.
fuller's
statements
to
that
effect,
that
order
than
that,
the
evidence
indicated
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
not
only
was
that
not
true,
that
she
was
not
involved
in
any
dissension,
that
the
dissension
had
occurred
and
it
started
before
she
was
ever
employed
at
the
agency,
that
the
executive
director
himself
was
at
least
partially
responsible
for
it,
and
that
she
did
not
have
authority
to
deal
with
it
anyway,
and
she
had
written
memorandums
to
her
supervisors
bringing
forth
this
problem
of...
within
her
division,
concerning
the
deficiencies.
the
executive
director
was
completely
unable
to
point
to
any
specific
area
where
she
was
deficient
in
her
job,
and
he
said
that
there
was
no
way
to
tell
whether
she
was
responsible
as
opposed
to
any
other
person
within
that
division,
or
even
himself.
therefore,
the
evidence
indicated
that
not
only
did
the
plaintiff
establish
her
prima
facie
case,
but
the
evidence
of
defendant
substantiated
the
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case.
initially,
i
would
distinguish
this
case
from
sweeney
and
mcdonnell
and
furnco,
on
one
important
ground.
and
this
was
brought
out
by
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
gee,
in
this
opinion,
and
earlier
in
turner
v.
texas
instruments.
in
mcdonnell
and
in
furnco
and
in
sweeney,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
reason
given
by
the
employer,
the...
in
articulating
a
legitimate,
non
discriminatory
reason,
is
undisputed.
such
as
for
example,
the
plaintiff
had
a
bad
absence
record.
that
is
basically
undisputed
in
those
cases.
the
burden
at
that
point
then
shifts
to
the
plaintiff
who
is
not
arguing
that
he
or
she
did
not
have
a
bad
attendance
record
but
that
that
was
not
actually
the
reason,
that
was
actually
the
reason
for
what
the
employer
did
and
that
there
was
another
reason.
that
was
pretextual
in
nature.
now
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
saying
in
this
case
is
that
the
reason
given
by
the
employer,
that
is,
that
the
plaintiff
was
involved
in
some
dissension
in
the
program
and
that
she
was
responsible
for
some
deficiencies
within
the
agency,
that
is
disputed
initially.
and
all
the
court
is
requiring,
all
the
fifth
circuit
is
requiring,
is
for
the
employer
to
have
to
prove
that
the
reasons
they
state
is
actually
the
reason
for
what
they
did.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
your
honor,
i
am
certain
if
i
were
writing
the
opinion
i
would
not
have
used
the
term
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
however,
i
think
it
is
applicable
in
this
case,
and
i
would
argue
that
regardless
of
that,
that
the
plaintiff
proved
her
case
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
followed
the
wrong
standard
for
the
reason
that
i
mentioned,
that
initially,
we
do
not
ever
get
to
the
question
of
pretext
in
this
case.
i
think
the
court
properly,
and
i
think
the
evidence
is
clear,
recognized
the
correct
legal
standard.
there
were
three
issues
involved,
and
i
think
the
case
has
to
be
put
in
perspective.
the
first
issue
was
the
plaintiff
argued
that
she
should
have
been
promoted.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
that
issue,
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
in
doing
so,
said
that
the
plaintiff
had
established
a
prima
facie
case,
that
the
defendant/employer
had
articulated
a
legitimate
non
discriminatory
reason
for
its
conduct;
the
burden
then
shifted
back
to
the
plaintiff
who
was
unable
to
show
that
this
was
pretextual
in
nature.
therefore,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
court
did
recognize
the
proper
legal
standard.
concerning
the
issue
involved
in
this
case,
with
the
court's
permission,
the
court
said
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
standard
of
the
question
of
pretext,
because
the
employer
has
never
proven
that
the
reasons
given
were
the
actual
reasons.
and
i
think
this
court,
i
don't
think
this
is
inconsistent
with
sweeney,
and
with
furnco--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--well,
i
think
the
word
articulated--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--the
word
articulate,
i
think,
in
this
context
as
set
forth
in
mcdonnell
douglas,
has
been
a
problem
for
lower
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
as
to
exactly
what
is
the
meaning
of
articulate.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
i
think
that
it
means,
and
it
should
mean,
and
be
adopted
by
this
court
to
be
the
same
language
as
set
forth
in
a
first
circuit
case
following
sweeney,
loeb
v.
textron,
incorporated,
in
which
that
was
a
case
sweeney,
after
furnco,
in
which
the
first
circuit
speaks
to
the
question
of
what
is
actually
articulating,
and
states
that
it
must
be
sufficient,
the
evidence
must
be
sufficient
on
its
face
to
rebut
or
dispel
the
inference
of
discrimination
that
rises
from
proof
of
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
there
certainly
is
a
problem.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
defendant/employer
prove
the
absence
of
a
discriminatory
motive.
judge
gee
spoke
exactly
to
that
question
and
distinguished
that
particular
situation
from
this
one.
he
was
simply
saying
that
he
has
to
prove
the
actual
reason
that
exists.
and
your
honor,
in
writing
sweeney,
in
footnote
2,
stated
that
the
petitioners
clearly
did
produce
evidence
to
support
their
legitimate
non
discriminatory
explanation
for
refusing
to
promote
the
respondent
during
the
years
in
question.
i
would
argue
that
this
court
even
recognized
the
need
to
produce
evidence
other
than
simply
a
bald
assertion,
completely
unsupported
by
any
other
evidence
in
the
record,
to
establish
and
to
show
that
the
actual
reason
was
what
the
employer
said
it
was.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
yes,
i
would
say
that
and
i
think
the
court
has
clearly
held
that
it's
not
the
burden
of
the
employer
to
prove
that.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
i
think
it
should
be
the
existence
of
a
legitimate
reason
and
that
it
should
be
articulated
with
enough
specificity
to
actually
identify
that
as
being
the
reason.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
it
is
not--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--yes,--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--right.
i
would
say--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--yes,
i
would.
i
would
say--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--no.
but
i
would
argue
that
in
this
case--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--it
has
to
be
at
least
credible
evidence
and
it
has
to
convince...
enough
to--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--well,
of
course,
convince
the
trier
of
facts.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
well
i
would
argue
that
in
this
case
it
is
impossible
to
tell,
based
on
the
district
court's
ruling,
because--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--in
that
event,
your
honor,
i
would
concede
that
unless
she
was
able
to
come
back
and
show
that
that
was
pretextual
in
nature,--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--right,
or
that
there
was--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--some
other
reason,--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--well
that's
correct,
if
you
assume
that,
from
the
record
that
the
district
court
did
believe
him--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--rather
than
her.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
but
i
would
argue
that
the
opinion
is
so
vague
in
the
sense
of
applying
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test,
and
that's
just
what
judge
gee
held
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
right.
and
of
course
that
goes
to
the
second
question
of
whether
an
independent
review
of
the
facts
can
be
made
under
the
east
v.
romine
doctrine.
however,
i
think
that,
and
i
will
speak
to
that
rule...
but
i
think
he
was
within
his
authority
to
consider
the
question
of
discrimination
as
being
one
of
ultimate
fact,
that
he
was
able
and
that
appeals
courts
are
able
to
decide
by
making
an
independent
review
of
all
the
record
and
the
evidence...
of
the
evidence
in
the
record.
and
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
so
overwhelming
in
the
record,
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
had
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
even
substantiated...
with
the
defendant's
own
proof,
substantiated
her
case,
that
he
was
able
to
make
a
reversal
on
that
point
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
did,
the
fifth
circuit
did
remand
this
case--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--on
the
equal
pay
issue.
therefore,
i
think
on
that
issue,
it
felt
like
it
was
not
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
the
actual
standard
of
what
does
articulate
a
legitimate
standard
mean.
as
we
talked
about
before.
as
i
stated,
i
believe
it
means
that
the
standard
has
to
be
stated,
or
the
reason
has
to
be
stated
with
at
least
enough
specificity
for
the
plaintiff
to
be
able
to
identify
that
as
the
reason
and
to
speak
to
it.
and
i
think
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
saying
and
what
judge
gee
was
saying,
is
that
the
employer
should
not
be
able
to
throw
out
rabbit
trails,
numerous
reasons,
even
though
they
might
be
legitimate
or
entirely
unsupported
or
untrue
by
the
evidence
in
the
record,
and
then
place
the
burden
back
on
the
plaintiff
to
disprove
the
reasons
that
are
legitimate
or
that
they're
not
true.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
well,
of
course,
assuming
that
the
correct
standard
was
followed
by
the
district
court,
which
would
not...
we
would
argue
is
not
the
case
here,
but
assuming
that
the
correct
standard
were
followed,
that
that
is
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
court
made
it
clear
in
its
subsidiary
findings,
which
it
did
not
in
this
case,
made
it
clear
that
it
believed
the
testimony
of
the
employer
xx
and
did
not
believe
the
testimony
of
the
employee.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
in
that
event,
and
assuming
that
the
court
followed,
enunciates
and
follows
the
correct
standard
under
mcdonell
douglas--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--well,
in
other
words,--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--first
requires
the
plaintiff
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case...
and
then
correctly
applies
the
rebuttal
standard
required
of
the
defendant,
and
simply
at
that
point
that
is
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
he
believes
the
testimony
of
the
defendant,
of
course,
then
he
would
be
correct
in
making
his
decision
for
the
employer.
i
would
argue
that
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
that
there
is
the
documentary
evidence
substantiates
as
pointed
out,
by
the
fifth
circuit,
substantiates
the
plaintiff's
view
of
the
case.
and
i
think
there's
other
evidence
that
would
indicate
that
the
district
court
did
not
properly
recognize
the
correct
standard.
it
mentioned
terms
such
as
this
was
a
rational
decision
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
that
decision
was
wrought
in
good
faith,
did
not
speak
at
all
to
the
mcdonnell
douglas
standard
nor
to
the
requirements
of
the
employer
or
the
plaintiff
in
that
type
of
a
situation.
and
i
think
it
was
so
clear
that
that
goes
again,
to
the
second
part
of
it,
that
the
court
was
obligated,
the
fifth
circuit
court
to
make
an
independent
review
of
the
facts.
i
would
argue
that
that...
making
an
independent
review
of
the
facts,
is
a
legitimate
rule
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit,
it's
an
old
standing
rule
in
numerous
types
of
cases,
cases
where
the
ultimate
finding
of
law
is
also
an
ultimate
finding
of
fact,
and
that
the
fifth
circuit
adopted
this
rule
in
title
vii
cases--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
that's
correct.
but
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
makes
it
obvious
that
if
you,
for
example,
on
the
question
of
upgrading,
or
promotion,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court,
the
judge
wrote
that
after
making
an
independent
review
of
the
record
he
was
convinced
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
therefore,
i
think
he
in
fact
used
the
clearly
erroneous
test,
he
simply
avoided
the
necessity
of
sending
this
case
back
to
the
district
court,
of
saying
we
need
more
findings
of
fact,
and
bringing
it
back...
this
case
was
filed
in
1973
and
it's
been
on
the
books
this
far...
this
long
at
this
point,
if
it
had
to
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court,
sent
back
to
the
fifth
circuit,
i
think
this
rule
is
one
of
efficacy
in
order
to
keep
down
the
burden
of
the
district
court
and
it's
particularly
necessary
where
there
are
insufficient
findings
of
subsidiary
facts
as
there
were
in
this
case
and
particularly
important
in
title
vii
cases,
where
discrimination
is
a
hard
thing
to
prove,
where
the
facts
are
always
relevant,
particularly
in
a
disparate
treatment
case,
the
particular
facts
are
extremely
relevant
and
therefore,
it's
certainly
a
rule
and
even
the
state,
in
its
brief,
admitted
the
efficacy
of
that
rule.
and
i
would
argue
that
the
court
should
not
disturb
that
rule.
speaking
briefly
again
on
the
nature
of
the
type
of
evidence
needed
to
articulate
a
legitimate,
non
discriminatory
reason,
by
the
employer,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
of
yet,
clearly
defined,
nor
has
any
court,
clearly
defined
exactly
what
is
meant
by
articulation
of
a
reason
and
what
type
of
evidence
is
necessary.
in
this
case,
i
would
argue
that
the
evidence
given
by
the
employer
was
completely
hypothetical
in
nature.
there
was
subjective
standards
used,
statements
such
as
"i
feel
like
he
was
better
qualified.
"
"i
made
my
decision
based
on
the
recommendations
of
subordinates.
"
first
off
being
hearsay,
secondly,
the
subordinates
themselves
may
have
discriminated,
there
was
no
comparative
type
of
data
of
any
kind
introduced,
as
was
pointed
out--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--well,
if
you're
speaking
of
articulate
in
that
sense,
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
sense
of
just
stating
it,
in
other
words,
just
making
and
oral
statement...
if
that
is
articulate,
then
i
would
argue
that
that
is
not
enough.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
well
i
would
argue
that
that
is
not
in
direct
conflict
with
sweeney.
that
in
sweeney,
when...
in
writing
the
opinion
you
stated
that--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--right.
but
there
was
a
statement
by
the
court
in
footnote
2,
saying
that
the
petitioners
in
sweeney
did
produce
evidence
to
support
their
legitimate
non
discriminatory
explanation.
in
other
words,
the
court
was
stating
that
some
evidence
other
than
simply
an
explanation,
an
oral
statement,
is
necessary.
and
certainly
sweeney
did
contain
that
other
type
of
evidence
such
as
another
female
had
recommended
sweeney
for
the
job...
i
mean,
made
an
unfavorable
recommendation
to
her,
another
female
had
taken
her
place...
there
was
other
evidence
highly
qualified
males
had
not
been
promoted
as
well
as
ms.
sweeney.
and
there
was
other
evidence
that
the
court
pointed
out
and
that
was
in
that
record
that
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
so
i
would
argue
that
sweeney
is
not
in
conflict
and
that
the
court
has
not
clearly
recognized
or
stated
the
standard
that
must
be
followed.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
standard
announced
in
loeb
v.
textron,
or
at
least
articulated
by
the
court
there.
and
i
think
it
is
the
same
thing
that
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
gee,
was
trying
to
get
to
in
his
opinion.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
again,
your
honor,
as
i
stated,
i
don't
agree
particularly
with
the
language
involved
there,
but
i
would
point
out
that--
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
--well,
i
think
that
we
need
to
look
at
exactly
what
he
applied
that
to.
and
i
think
that
what
he
was
saying
and
what
the
court
in
loeb
was
saying
is
that
the
plaintiff,
in
any
kind
of
a
case,
has
the
opportunity
and
should
have
the
opportunity
to
disprove
the
reason
given
by
the
employer;
that
if
the
employer
says
the
reason...
for
example,
the
reason
that
i
fired
her
was
because
she
had
a
poor
attendance
record,
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
the
opportunity
as
in
this
case
to
introduce
evidence
and
show...
she
doesn't
have...
i
don't
have
a
poor
attendance
record,
i
was
in
attendance
every
day.
and
that,
in
that
case,
we're
not
switching
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant,
we're
just
saying
the
defendant,
employer,
has
not
even
rebutted
the
prima
facie
case
set
forth
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
that
is
correct.
because,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
court
stated,
and
i
think
it
spoke
specifically
to
that
point,
that
they
are
simply...
that
it
said
that
defendant
may
refute
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case
by
articulating
a
legitimate
and
non
discriminatory
reason.
it
goes
on
to
state
that
in
this
case,
on
this
particular
issue,
that
the
plaintiff...
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
completely
disproves
the
reason
given
by
the
employer
for
his
conduct.
therefore,
you
don't
even
have
to
go
to
the
third
step.
i
think
the
court
certainly
recognized
the
third
step
because
on
the
first
issue
of
non
promotion
it
reached
the
third
step.
it
said
plaintiff
had
presented
a
prima
facie
case,
defendant/employer
had
articulated
a
legitimate
non
discriminatory
reason,
but
plaintiff
was
unable
to
prove
that
this
was
pretext,
pretextual
in
nature.
and
therefore,
that
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
employer
on
the
issue
of
promotion,
prevailed.
however,
concerning
the
issue
of
termination,
simply
saying
that
plaintiff's
prima
facie
case
was
so
strong
and
the
defendant/employer's
case
was
so
weak
and
unsupported
by
the
evidence
that
the
prima
facie
case
was
not
rebutted
and
therefore
plaintiff
prevailed
on
a...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
i
think
this
speaks
to
what
justice
stevens
was
talking
about
earlier.
what
happens
if
the
plaintiff,
for
example,
produces
prima
facie
case
and
evidence
of
negligence
in
an
automobile
accident
case.
produces
ten
eye
witnesses
and
engineers
testimony,
let's
say
that
the
defendant
ran
a
red
light,
and
the
defendant
simply
gets
up
and
says
i
don't
think
it
happened
that
way,
it
happened
some
other
way.
and
the
court
at
that
point,
i
think
is
able
to
say,
that
the
defendant
has
not...
the
plaintiff
has
presented
the
prima
facie
case,
the
defendant
has
not
dispelled
or
rebutted
that,
and
therefore,
the
finding
would
be
proper
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
hubert
l.
gill
no,
there
wouldn't.
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
argue
that
the
judge
or
the
jury
or
whatever
may
be
involved,
has
the
right
to
believe
who
they
want
to
believe.
however,
i
think
that
is
not
applicable
in
this
particular
situation.
because
number
one,
i
think
it
is
unclear...
or
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court
did
not
apply
the
proper
standards
from
the
beginning.
it
never
even
started,
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
had
presented
a
prima
facie
case.
it
used
questions
of
good
faith
and
rational
conduct
as
the
test.
and
i
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
so
over
whelming
as
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
to
indicate
that
the
finding
was
clearly
erroneous.
as
a
matter
of
law.
thank
you.
