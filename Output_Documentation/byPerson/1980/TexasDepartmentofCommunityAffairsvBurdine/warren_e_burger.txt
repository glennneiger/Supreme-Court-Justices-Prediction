in

v.

ann
burdine.
mr.

whenever
you
are
ready.

mr.
gill.
chief
justice
burger
suppose
only
two
people
know
the
facts,
the
complaining
party,
the
employee;
and
the
employer
who
testifies.
the
employer
states
a
set
of
reasons
and
the
court
accepts
them.
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
chief
justice
burger
let's
make
it
concrete.
it's
just
one
on
one,
the
testimony
of
the
supervisor
is
that
three
out
of
four
letters
that
the
person
prepared
had
to
be
rewritten
to
correct
the
errors,
but
that
the
erroneous
drafts
have
been
thrown
away
so
there's
no
documentary
evidence,
and
xx
the
judge
says
he
believes
the
testimony
of
that
person
and
doesn't
believe
the
contrary
testimony
that
no
errors
were
made.
chief
justice
burger
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you.
chief
justice
burger
we
have
to
assume
that
that
language
reflected
his
state
of
mind
and
his
analytical
processes,
don't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wilson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
powell
has
two
--
the
opinions
in
two
cases
to
announce
for
the
court.
