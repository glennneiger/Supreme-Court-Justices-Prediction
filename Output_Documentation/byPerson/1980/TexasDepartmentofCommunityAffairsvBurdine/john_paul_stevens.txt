justice
stevens
mr.
wilson,
since
you've
been
interrupted,
who
were
the
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
decided
this
case?
was
it
argued
orally?
justice
stevens
their
names
don't
appear
in
the
papers,
at
least
i
can't
find
them.
justice
stevens
judge
gee?
justice
stevens
jones
and
clark?
i
couldn't
find
it.
it's
in
the
brief.
justice
stevens
under
your
view,
mr.
wilson,
supposing
the
plaintiff's
evidence
went
in
just
as
you've
described
it,
and
the
defendant
offered
no
evidence
at
all
but
had
filed
an
answer
in
which
they
had
articulated
the
legitimate
reason
for
discharge,
said
that
the
person
was
incompetent
but
didn't
offer
any
evidence.
how
would
the
district
court
decide
the
case?
justice
stevens
i'm
curious
to
know
what
the
word
articulate
means?
justice
stevens
a
general
denial,
plus
a
statement
in
the
answer
that
the
real
reason
is
the
legitimate
reason.
a
reason
articulated
in
the
answer
but
unsupported
by
proof.
and
i'm
asking
in
that
state
of
the
record,
how
does
a
judge
decide
the
case?
justice
stevens
you
could
decide
it
either
way.
justice
stevens
and
supposing
the
defendant
got
on
the
stand
and
said
my
reason
is
x
legitimate
reason
and
that's
all
he
said,
no
corroborating
evidence,
and
then
the
judge
put
in
a
finding
and
said
i
do
not
believe
the
defendant.
would
the
plaintiff
then
prevail?
justice
stevens
you're
not
putting
any
evidence
of
pre
text
in,
other
than
the
prima
facie
evidence
of--
justice
stevens
mr.
wilson,
do
you
contend
on
this
record
that
the
defendant
did
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
there
was
a
valid
reason
for
the
discharge?
justice
stevens
isn't
that
equivalent
to
a
finding
that
i
believe
in
mr.
fuller?
justice
stevens
isn't
that
equivalent
to
a
finding
of
fact
that
i
believe
that
mr.
fuller
testified
truthfully?
justice
stevens
then
why
isn't
that
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
stevens
isn't
what
the
fifth
circuit
did,
is
establish
a
rule
of
law
that
oral
testimony
must
be
corroborated?
justice
stevens
but
convince
whom?
justice
stevens
and
didn't
mr.
fuller's
evidence
convince
the
trier
of
facts?
justice
stevens
suppose
that
he
had
written
a
little
different
opinion;
i
suppose
neither
of
these
opinions
is
a
model
of
perfection,
as
no
opinions
are,
supposing
he'd
said
i
believe
mr.
fuller,
that
he
thought
this
lady
was
responsible
for
dissension.
maybe
he's
wrong,
maybe
somebody
else
was
really
responsible
for
it,
but
when
he
made
his
discharge
decision
that
was
what
he
thought
and
he
convinced
me
he
was
telling
me
the
truth.
does
she
still
have
a
claim?
justice
stevens
that
he
was
lying,
in
other
words?
justice
stevens
then
if
you
admit
that
there
was--
justice
stevens
--then
the
distinction
between
these
other
cases
does
not
turn
on
the
existence
of
a
valid
reason,
because
there
we're
assuming
that
she
really
wasn't
responsible
for
the
dissension
but
he
just
thought
she
was.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
if
you
just
read
his
opinion
you
certainly
would
come
to
the
conclusion
he
believed
mr.
fuller.
justice
stevens
no,
because
judge
gee
didn't
send
it
back
for
another
trial
or
another
opinion,
he
entered...
he
directed
that
judgment
be
entered
in
her
favor.
justice
stevens
on
the
equal
pay
issue.
