justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
of
these
is
79-1764,
texas
department
of
commissioner
of
affairs
against
burdine.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
a
proper
evidentiary
burden
borne
by
an
employer
in
a
discrimination
suit
brought
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
when
a
discharged
employee
proves
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
the
employer
then
must
prove
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
nondiscriminatory
reasons
existed.
the
court
further
held
that
the
employer
also
must
prove
that
the
person
retained
in
the
position
at
issue
was
better
qualified
than
the
rejected
employee.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
to
the
appropriate
burden
of
proof
to
rebut
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
our
prior
cases
have
held
that
the
employerâ€™s
burden
is
to
identify
clearly
by
evidence
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
the
employment
decision.
this
is
merely
a
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence,
the
overall
burden
of
persuasion
remands
throughout
the
case
with
the
plaintiff
employee.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
our
prior
decisions
and
imposed
an
inappropriate
burden
of
proof
on
the
employer
in
this
case.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
the
application
of
the
correct
legal
standard.
