justice
stewart
and
somebody
else
of
a
different
gender,
in
this
case,
or
a
race
in
some
other
case,
is
hired
to
fill
the
vacancy.
that's
part
of
the
test.
justice
stewart
yes,
that's
part
of
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
stewart
even
though
there's
a
general
denial
in
the
answer?
justice
stewart
as
you
say,
if
it's
been
proved
by
the
defendant
that
they
are
not
pretextual
that's
the
end
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
there's
no
room
for
the
plaintiff's...
or
for
the
last
step
in
mcdonnell
douglas.
justice
stewart
i
said,
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
i
had
your
point.
justice
stewart
well
in
any
event,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
language
chosen
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
at
least
in
this
case,
is
not
quite
accurate?
justice
stewart
and
that
articulate
means
something
more
than
just
say,
it
means
to
adduce
evidence?
justice
stewart
to
meet
the
prima
facie
case
of
the
plaintiff?
justice
stewart
you
would
say
that
wouldn't
you?
justice
stewart
because
it
doesn't
mean
much
more
than
that.
justice
stewart
you're
not
contending
that
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
not
applicable
to
title
vii
cases,
are
you?
justice
stewart
and
that
would
include
rule
52(a).
