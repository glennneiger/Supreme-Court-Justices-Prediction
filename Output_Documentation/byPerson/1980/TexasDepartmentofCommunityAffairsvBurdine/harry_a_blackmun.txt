justice
blackmun
what
do
you
think
was
the
rule
that
judge
gee
developed
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
its
panel?
justice
blackmun
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
i
asked
what
the
rule
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
developed?
justice
blackmun
did
it
go
that
far,
or
did
it
merely
say
that
the
defendant
has
to
show
the
existence
of
an
acceptable
reason?
and
if
so,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
blackmun
well
who
else
would
know
whether
it
is...
whether
a
reason
exists?
if
i
am
the
employer?
justice
blackmun
maybe
if
you
had
been
writing
the
opinion
you
wouldn't
have...
i
mean,
to
switch
you
language
a
bit...
you
wouldn't
have
used
the
word
articulated?
justice
blackmun
but
you're
already
bound
by
the
use
of
the
word
here.
justice
blackmun
well,
what
do
you
think
it
means?
justice
blackmun
do
you
think
that
something
else,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
described
it,
might
be
the
existence
of
a
reason,
not
necessarily
that
that
was
the
reason
that
prevailed,
but
at
least
the
existence
of
a
legitimate
reason?
