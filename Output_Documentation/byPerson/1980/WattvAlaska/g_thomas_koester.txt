mr.
g.
thomas
koester
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
tom
koester
and
i
represent
the
state
of
alaska
in
this
proceeding.
alaska's
position
here
is
really
quite
straightforward.
the
moose
range
leases,
the
leases
on
the
moose
range
with
which
we're
dealing
here,
were
issued
under
the
authority
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920,
and
section
35
of
that
act
provides
specifically
that
the
revenues
from
leases
issued
under
the
authority
of
the
act
are
to
be
distributed
in
a
certain
fashion.
in
alaska
those
revenues
are
to
be
distributed
90
percent
to
the
state
and
10
percent
to
the
federal
government.
it
is
our
position
that
the
1964
amendment
to
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
did
not
change
the
scheme
set
out
in
the
mineral
leasing
act
for
distribution
of
the
revenues
from
the
kenai
range.
our
position
is
based
on
an
analysis,
first,
of
the
policies
underlying
section
35,
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
1964
amendment,
and
on
the
administrative
practice
of
the
department
of
interior
with
respect
to
the
revenues
received
from
the
kenai
range.
now,
the
policy
underlying
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
has
been
in
effect
since
1920,
and
that
is
a
policy
by
which
congress
has
determined
it
is
appropriate
to
share
revenues
from
mineral
exploitation
of
the
public
lands
in
this
country
with
the
states
in
which
those
lands
are
located.
that
has
been
the
policy
since
1920.
it
was
recently
reaffirmed
in
the
1976
amendments
to
the
mineral
leasing
act.
the
policy
with
respect
to
alaska
has
been
that
alaska
should
receive
a
greater
portion
than
the
other
states.
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
alaska
is
not
covered
by
the
reclamation
act,
into
which
a
significant
portion
of
revenues
from
public
lands
in
other
states
is
placed.
but
more
importantly,
as
the
legislative
history
cited
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
alaska
statehood
act
demonstrates,
congress
was
concerned
when
it
conferred
statehood
on
alaska
that
there
was
a
very
distorted
land
ownership
pattern
in
the
territory
of
alaska.
the
federal
government
owned
99
percent
of
the
land.
in
addition,
significant
portions
of
the
public
lands
in
alaska
were
withdrawn
for
purposes
which
congress
found,
withdrawals
that
congress
found
were
excessive.
as
a
result,
congress
provided
that
90
percent
of
the
revenues
from
those
lands
would
be
given
to
the
state
because
these
withdrawals
were
hampering
development
in
alaska.
this
would
include
public
lands
that
were
in
the
withdrawal
status,
if
those
lands
were
leased
for
mineral
exploitation,
as
the
kenai
moose
range
was.
in
accordance
with
these
policies
underlying
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
the
department
of
interior
distributed
the
oil
and
gas
lease
revenues
from
the
kenai
moose
range
pursuant
to
section
35,
from
the
date
of
statehood
until
this
question
was
asked
by
the
director
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
in
1975.
so
we
have
a
practice
from
1959
through
1975
unbroken,
of
these
revenues
being
distributed
pursuant
to
section
35.
the
director's
1975
question
focused
on
an
amendment
11
years
earlier,
in
1964,
to
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
1964
amendment,
it
is
agreed
by
all
parties,
was
to
remove
or
eliminate
opposition
on
the
part
of
states
to
the
acquisition
of
land
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
wildlife
refuges.
the
problem
was
that
once
these
lands
were
acquired,
they
were
taken
off
the
tax
rolls,
and
that
the
existing
provisions
of
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
were
inadequate
to
compensate
the
local
governments
for
the
lost
revenues.
because
the
governor
of
an
affected
state
could
block
acquisition,
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
found
that
it
was
unable
to
acquire
land
because
the
counties
were
afraid
they
were
going
to
lose
money.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
this
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
public
land
revenues,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
congressional
policy
in
section
35.
the
public
land
revenues
are
to
be
shared
with
states.
congress
passed
the
amendment
changing
the
formula
for
distribution
of
revenues
from
acquired
lands
and
eliminated
the
obstacle
to
continued
land
acquisition.
but
at
the
same
time
it
gave
rise
to
the
director's
question
in
1975
by
adding
the
word
"minerals"
to
the
list
of
revenue
sources
governed
by
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
now,
as
has
been
mentioned,
it
was
described
in
the
cover
letter,
this
proposal
to
add
the
word
mr.
justice
white.
nor
is
the
addition
of
the
minerals
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
subsequent
legislative
history.
now,
in
testifying
on
the
proposed
bill,
we
believe
it
is
significant
that
the
department
of
the
interior
witnesses
stated
that
this
bill
if
passed,
including
the
word
"minerals",
would
not
affect
the
distribution
of
revenues
from
public
lands.
in
fact,
they
provided
charts
showing
what
the
revenue
distribution
was
under
the
existing
law
and
that
it
would
be
under
the
amendment
if
passed.
it's
significant,
we
believe,
that
revenues
attributable
to
the
kenai
moose
range
both
in
1962
and
in
1964
totalled
less
than
$10,000.
at
this
time
the
oil
and
gas
revenues
from
the
kenai
moose
exceeded
three
and
a
half
million
dollars.
and
it
is
significant
that
those
oil
and
gas
revenues
were
not
included
in
the
charts
prepared
by
the
department
of
interior
for
the
use
of
congress
addressing
this
amendment.
the
witnesses
also
testified
that
some
oil
and
gas
revenues
currently
were
being
distributed
under
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act,
but
no
additional
oil
and
gas
revenues
would
be
subjected
to
that
distribution
as
a
result
of
this
amendment.
well,
the
comptroller
general
had
ruled
in
1942
that
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
did
not
reach
oil
and
gas
revenues.
that
was
still
the
administrative
interpretation
by
the
comptroller
general,
charged
with
overseeing
expenditures
of
revenues
received
by
the
united
states
in
1964
when
this
amendment
was
passed.
oil
and
gas
revenues
from
acquired
lands
were
subject
to
the
formula
contained
in
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
but
they
were
subjected
to
that
formula
by
virtue
of
section
6
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
for
acquired
lands.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
right.
and
it
was
created
out
of
public
lands,
not
acquired
lands.
so,
under
the
comptroller
general's
ruling,
those
revenues
would
not
be
governed
by
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
if
the
kenai
moose
range
had
been
created
out
of
acquired
lands,
they
would
have
been
governed
by
the
formula
in
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act,
but
only
because
section
6
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
for
acquired
lands
directed
that
they
be
distributed
in
the
formula
in
the
same
way
that
non
mineral
revenues
from
those
acquired
lands
were
to
be
distributed.
now,
the
interior
department
witnesses
testified
that
no
new
revenues
would
be
subjected
to
the
formula
in
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
by
virtue
of
the
amendment,
and
this
was
true
even
though
congressmen
were
concerned
at
the
time
they
were
considering
this
amendment
that
the
revenues
available
to
the
department
of
interior
to
make
these
payments
to
counties
were
going
to
be
insufficient.
it
would
seem
that
if
interior
proposal
to
add
the
word
$4
million
a
year
more
from
the
kenai
national
moose
range.
or
certainly,
congress,
if
it
had
intended
the
word
$4
million
annually
available,
which
will
eliminate
any
concern
in
this
regard.
now,
following
the
passage
of
the
amendment,
the
department
of
the
interior
continued
its
pre-1964
practice
of
distributing
the
kenai
moose
range
oil
and
gas
revenues
pursuant
to
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
well,
i
think
perhaps--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--the
argument
is
made
in
our
brief.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
throughout
maintained
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
"minerals"
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
oil
and
gas
revenues
from
kenai
national
moose
range
are
subject
to
distribution
under
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
well,
alaska's
position
has
always
been,
and
still
is,
in
fact,
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
application
of
the
plain
meaning
rule.
here
you
have
two
statutes
which
lead
to
diametrically
opposed
results.
however--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--right.
i
think
what
our
argument
is,
is
that
if
this
case
is
going
to
turn--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--if
this...
no,
i'm
not,
except
in
response
to
your
question.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
if
this
case
is
to
turn
on
the
plain
meaning
rule,
then
it
must
be
resolved
that
section
35
controls,
because
section
35
and
the
mineral
leasing
act
in
general
speak
specifically
to
oil
and
gas,
whereas
the
word
"minerals"
in
many
cases
is
construed
to
include
oil
and
gas,
in
some
cases
is
construed
not
to
include
oil
and
gas,
but
in
any
event
requires
construction.
it
is
not
a
plain
meaning,
it
is
not
susceptible
to
plain
meaning
construction,
as
including
oil
and
gas.
it
requires
a
process
of
construction.
but
our
basic
position
is
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
the
application
of
the
plain
meaning
rule,
because
we
have
two
statutes
involved,
and
even
under
a
plain
meaning
rule
interpretation
of
the
word
35,
which
under
its
plain
meaning
leads
to
an
opposite
result.
so
a
process
of
construction
is
required
here,
and
one
must
try
to
determine
what
congress
intended.
now,
after
congress
passed
the
1964
amendment,
and
added
the
word
pre-1964
practice
of
distributing
these
revenues
pursuant
to
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
now,
this
administrative
practice
was
consistent,
entirely
consistent,
with
the
policy
underlying
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
that
is,
to
share
public
land
revenues
with
states.
it
also
was
consistent
with
the
congressional
policy
with
respect
to
public
lands
in
alaska,
that
alaska
should
receive
90
percent
of
those
revenues,
because
of
the
excessive
number
of
withdrawals
in
alaska.
and
finally,
it
is
consistent
with
the
testimony
of
the
department
of
interior
witnesses,
when
testifying
before
congress,
that
this
amendment
would
have
no
effect
on
the
distribution
of
public
land
revenues,
that
it
would
not
subject
additional
oil
and
gas
revenues
to
distribution
under
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
however,
when
the
director
in
1975
asked
his
question,
whether
this
amendment
11
years
earlier
changed
the
rules,
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
and
the
comptroller
general
adopted
the
position
which
is
now
being
taken
by
the
petitioners
in
this
court.
they
rested
their
conclusion
on
the
plain
meaning
rule.
now
i
believe
that,
as
we
have
shown,
the
plain
meaning
rule
is
inappropriate
unless
it
is
going
to
be
used
to
find
that
section
35
controls.
but
what
we
believe
is
more
interesting
at
this
point
is
the
argument
which
has
been
raised
by
the
federal
petitioners
in
their
brief,
and
that
is
somehow
that
in
1964
there
was
a
perception
that
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
controlled
these
revenues.
now,
under
the
comptroller
general's
rulings
it
did
not,
but
that
there
was
somehow
this
perception
on
the
part
of
senior
department
of
the
interior
officials,
that
this
perception
was
communicated
to
congress...
although
they
concede
that
it
may
possibly
only
have
been
communicated
by
inference...
and
that
congress
may
therefore
have
added
the
word
"minerals"
based
on
this
perception
or
understanding,
and
the
court
now
should
effectuate
that
presumed
congressional
understanding
by
construing
the
word
"minerals"
to
include
the
oil
and
gas
revenues
from
the
public
lands
of
the
kenai
national
moose
range.
well
this
argument
requires
several
assumptions
before
you
can
get
from
point
a
to
point
b.
the
first
is
that
both
the
interior
department
officials
and
congress
were
unaware
of
the
comptroller
general's
rulings.
the
second
is
that
they
were
unaware
that
the
kenai
moose
range
was
generating
$4
million
a
year
in
oil
and
gas
revenues
because
their
testimony
was,
and
the
charts
showed,
the
kenai
revenues
were
only
$10,000
a
year.
the
third
is
that
they
were
unaware
that
interior
was
in
a
process
of
distributing
these
revenues
under
a
totally
different
statutory
scheme,
under
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
and
finally,
as
has
been
discussed,
that
interior
continued
to
distribute
these
revenues
in
the
wrong
way,
or
a
way
which
was
not
perceived
by
the
senior
officials
of
the
department
of
the
interior
as
being
the
proper
manner.
we
submit
that
this
chain
of
assumptions
that
must
be
made
before
one
reaches
the
result
sought
by
the
petitioners
simply
is
untenable.
it
requires
too
much
of
a
leap
of
fate.
we
believe
justice
brennan's
comment
in
the
sec
v.
sloan
case
suggests
a
more
appropriate
assumption
and
that
is
that
this
continuous
process
by
which
the
department
of
the
interior
distributed
the
revenues
pursuant
to
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
more
accurately
reflects
both
the
department
of
interior's
understanding
and
congress's
understanding.
if
there
is
any
doubt
in
this
regard,
one
would
suggest
that
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior...
the
evidence
is
that
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
gave
the
directive
to
continue
this
practice.
so
even
if
his
senior
officials
were
confused,
the
secretary
wasn't.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
i
don't
believe
so.
he
turns
to
his
solicitor
for
legal
advice.
but
here,
i
think,
the
issue
really
is
that
no
legal
advice
was
necessary.
in
1964
everyone
understood
that
public
land
oil
and
gas
revenues,
whether
in
wildlife
refuges
or
not,
were
subject
to
distribution
under
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
so
no
legal
advice
was
necessary.
it
was
not
necessary
to
get
a
formal
opinion
at
that
time.
the
secretary
simply
said,
continue
the
preexisting
practice,
because
there
is
no
need
to
change
it.
now,
this
construction...
that
is,
the
construction
adopted
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1966
and
continued
until
1975...
leaves
intact
without
an
implied
amendment
or
repeal
the
congressional
policy
regarding
the
sharing
of
revenues
under
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
revenues
from
public
lands.
it
also
leaves
intact
the
specific
congressional
policy
that
revenues
from
public
lands
in
alaska
should
be
shared
on
a
basis
of
90
percent
to
alaska
and
ten
percent
to
the
federal
government.
now,
in
its
reply
brief
and
here
today,
kenai...
and
briefly
alluded
to
by
mr.
claiborne...
discuss
alaska's
changed
economics.
and
as
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
alaska
now
is
enjoying
rather
large
public
revenues
from
state
owned
mineral
lands.
however,
this
seems
to
me
to
be
beside
the
point.
congress
in
1964
could
not
foresee
that
alaska
would
enjoy
this
kind
of
bonanza.
moreover,
these
revenues
are
from
nonrenewable
resources.
what
is
here
today
will
be
gone
tomorrow.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
i
believe,
if
it
is
to
be
changed,
that
is,
for
congress
to
do
it--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--well,
i
think
there
still
might
be
an
argument
here
because,
actually,
this
was
one
of
the
fundamental
underpinnings
which
underlay
the
statehood
act
and
while
it
may
or
may
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
compact,
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
issue
really
needs
to
be
decided
here,
it
is
certainly
an
issue
that
that
will
be--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--well,
i
think
it's
sufficiently
clear
though,
here,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
change
those--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--well,
then,
i
think
you
should
consider
very
carefully
the
fact--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--yes.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
in
the
lower
courts
we
did.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
and
here
we've
mentioned--
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
--right.
we
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
it
is
incorporated
in
the
statehood
act,
and
we've
not
made
a
definitive
argument
on
the
parameters
of
the
statehood
compact,
what
it
would
require
to
change
that
statehood
compact.
and
i
think
we
recognize
that
there
are
legitimate
policy
concerns
under
which
congress
can
deal
with
revenues
from
public
lands.
however,
it
is
a
very
interesting
question,
and
particularly,
given
the
policy
considerations
that
congress
gave
when
it
enacted
statehood
for
alaska
to
the
distribution
of
public
land
revenues,
it
certainly
seems
that
at
least
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
change,
it
is
a
change
that
must
be
made
by
the
legislature.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
well,
i
think,
as
was
mentioned,
i
believe
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
white,
the
authority
for
those
sales
of
surface
resources
stems
from
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
in
other
words,
congress
in
dealing
with
mineral
revenues
in
alaska,
revenues
derived
under
the
mineral
leasing
act,
provided
specifically
that
90
percent
of
them
were
to
go
to
the
state.
however,
it
did
not
make
that
provision
with
respect
to
non
mineral
revenues.
and
therefore
the
non
mineral
revenues
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
allows
their
sale
in
the
first
place,
in
this
case
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
and
as
the
charts
in
the
legislative
history
show,
the
kenai
borough
was
receiving
some
of
those
revenues,
even
at
that
time,
albeit
they
were
minimal
compared
to
the
oil
and
gas
revenues
which
were
being
derived.
now,
the
judgments
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
we
believe,
reached
an
appropriate
solution
to
the
dilemma
here.
that
is,
to
construe
the
word
"minerals"
as
reaching
those
from
acquired
lands,
those
on
acquired
lands
but
not
reaching
those
on
public
lands.
mr.
claiborne
suggests
that
this
type
of
narrowing
construction
indulged
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
somewhat
unusual...
in
fact,
unique,
i
think,
was
the
word
he
used.
however,
this
court
has
done
that
very
thing.
in
united
states
v.
american
trucking
association,
it
narrowed
the
construction
of
the
word
v.
colorado
public
interest
group
in
1976
it
narrowed
the
term
"radioactive
materials".
and
in
both
cases
it
was
persuaded
by
the
fact
that
with
respect
to
one
subclass
contained
within
the
general
term
being
construed
congress
had
definitively
legislated
there
was
a
strong
preexisting
congressional
scheme
of
regulation.
and
that's
precisely
the
case
here.
there
has
been
a
policy
since
1920
of
distributing
public
land
revenues
under
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
now,
mr.
cranston
has
suggested
that
there
is
a
problem
here
in
that
counties
containing
reserved
lands
do
not
get
these
revenues
while
counties
containing
acquired
lands
with
oil
and
gas
development
do.
in
terms
of
the
money,
direct
revenue
sharing
to
the
counties,
as
the
federal
petitioners
point
out
in
their
brief,
there
were
amendments
in
1978
to
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
which
authorized
additional
payments
to
counties
containing
reserved
lands.
those
payments
can
be
as
much
as
75
cents
per
acre.
or,
in
the
event
that
timber
sales,
material
sales,
gravel
sales
and
so
on,
exceed
that
amount,
then
they
would
get
the
higher
figure.
so
they
get
the
largest
amount
available
either
under
the
provisions
of
the
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
or
the
75
cents
per
acre.
but
i
think,
more
significant
is
that
in
1964
when
interior
was
proposing
that
this
word
"minerals"
be
included,
the
interior
department
felt
that
these
oil
and
gas
revenues
being
shared
with
counties
resulted
in
windfalls
to
the
counties.
interior
was
not
at
all
pleased
that
counties
were
receiving
oil
and
gas
revenues.
and
yet
what
is
now
suggested
is
that
by
adding
the
word
1964.
finally,
the
policy
of
the
1964
amendment,
as
i
mentioned,
was
to
eliminate
objection
to
the
acquisition
of
additional
lands
for
wildlife
refuges.
if
this
statute,
the
amendment,
is
construed
as
changing
the
distribution
formula
for
oil
and
gas
revenues
from
public
lands,
the
very
evil
sought
to
be
remedied
by
that
amendment
would
result
in
that,
certainly
in
the
case
of
alaska,
the
state
would
object
to
the
creation
of
additional
wildlife
ranges
if
in
fact
that
would
change
the
revenue
distribution
from
those
lands.
and
yet
that
is
what
is
asserted
here.
we
believe
that
this
court
should
not
construe
the
1964
amendment
in
a
fashion
which
could
result
in
the
very
evil
which
was
sought
to
be
remedied
by
congress,
and
yet
that
would
happen
here.
mr.
g.
thomas
koester
the
only
things
that
i
can
recall
are
in
fact
sand
and
gravel,
and
those
were
explicitly
mentioned
in
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
there
is
nothing
else
that
i
can
conceive
of
although
i
suppose...
and
purely
speculating...
but
if
a
wildlife
refuge
had
a
tourist
shop
and
they
sold
gold
trinkets
or
something,
perhaps
that
would
be
included.
but
again,
that
would
be
material
not
specifically
subject
already
to
governance
by
a
specific
statute.
in
other
words,
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
does
not
authorize
the
leasing
of
land
for
gold
extraction.
and
so,
to
the
extent
that
the
department
of
interior
could
sell
gold
trinkets
or
nuggets
that
it
found,
or
stones,
or
pebbles,
or
shells,
that
authorization
would
come
out
of
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act,
and
the
terms
of
that
act
would
then
apply.
but
we're
not
dealing
with
that
here,
we're
dealing
with
oil
and
gas,
which
was
already
governed
by
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
for
the
policy
reasons
underlying
section
35
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
and
the
legislative
history
underlying
the
1964
amendment,
as
well
as
the
administrative
practice
of
the
department
of
interior
for
11
years
following
that
amendment,
we
believe
this
court
should
affirm
the
decisions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
