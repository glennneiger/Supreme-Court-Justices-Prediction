justice
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
is
there
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
recover
the
money
paid
between
1964
and
1975?
justice
stevens
if
you're
right,
alaska
has
about
$50
million
that
it
shouldn't
have,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
before
you
get
into
your
analysis
of
the
'64
statute,
would
you
tell
me
what
is
the
statutory
authority
for
the
secretary
to
derive
revenues
from
the
sale
of
timber,
hay,
grass,
and
all
these
others,
sand
and
gravel,
the
things
other
than
minerals?
is
there
some
statute
that
authorizes
the
disposition
of
those?
justice
stevens
if
the
mineral
leasing
act
did
not
apply
would
that
statutory
authority
have
authorized
the
making
of
the
leases
that
are
involved
here?
justice
stevens
it
isn't
entirely
mooted
out,
because
isn't
it
normally
true
that
the
division
of
revenues
would
be
computed
according
to
a
statute
that
also
grants
the
authority
to
make
the
lease
in
the
first
place?
it's
somewhat
unusual
in
your
position
to
have
the
statutory
authority
for
everything
but
minerals
in
one
statute,
and
the
mineral
leasing
authority
in
another
statute,
but
say
that
doesn't
govern
the
way
the
money
should
be
divided
up.
justice
stevens
mr.
cranston,
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
apparently
the
change
was
drafted
by
the
department
of
interior
as
a
perfecting
amendment,
and
yet
they
didn't
apparently
realize
that
the
change
meant
what
you
now
say
it
means,
for
at
least
ten
years?
justice
stevens
well,
is
it
not
correct
that
your
basic
position
is
that
it
was
much
more
than
a
perfecting
amendment,
it
made
a
fundamental
change?
justice
stevens
but
the
people
who
wrote
the
checks
didn't
think
that.
justice
stevens
and
nobody
complained
for
whenever
it's...
'55
or
so,
and
if
you
want
to
add
another
ten
years,
then
there's
20
years
of
construction
of
the
act.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
i'm
talking
about
the
period
before
1964.
justice
stevens
could
i
ask
one
more
question,
please,
mr.
cranston?
because
if
you
lose,
the
state
of
alaska
gets
90
percent.
if
you
win
the
county
gets
25
percent.
what
part
of
the
90
percent
would
probably
inure
to
the
benefit
of
your
county?
in
other
words,
what
part
of
the
total
state
of
alaska
does
the
kenai
borough
represent
in
either
economic
or
population
or
some
kind
of
terms?
justice
stevens
about
five
percent--
justice
stevens
--mr.
koester,
may
i
ask
one
question?
you
refer
in
your
brief
to
some
charts
or
material
in
the
1964
legislative
history
which
i
have
not
locked
at
myself,
which
suggest
a
breakdown
of
what
revenues
were
being
generated
and
were
not
to
be
changed.
was
there
any
source
of
revenue
in
that
record
that
could
be
classified
as
a
mineral
revenue
such
as,
say,
it
was
stone
or...
something
like
that,
other
than
oil
and
gas
on
the
one
hand,
or
things
like
sand
and
gravel,
which
were
previously
mentioned
in
the
statutes
specifically?
justice
stevens
that
can't
be
entirely
true
because
weren't
there
sand
and
gravel
sales?
justice
stevens
you
mean,
that
there
was
any
sand
and
gravel
revenue?
