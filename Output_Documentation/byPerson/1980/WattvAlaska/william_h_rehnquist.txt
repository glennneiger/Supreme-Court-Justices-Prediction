justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
claiborne,
both
the
question
of
justice
stevens
and
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
suggest
that
the
answer
reached
by
the
9th
circuit
is
wrong
in
this
case.
i
realize
there's
a
good
deal
of
money
turning
on
the
issue,
but
when
you
get
right
down
to
the
statutory
materials
and
go
to
the
presumption
against
implied
repeals
and
the
specific
governing
the
general
and
other
such
maxims,
on
the
legal
issue
isn't
it
pretty
close
to
a
coin
toss?
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
cranston,
is
that
any
different
than
the
situation
of
any
other
western
state
that
was
admitted
to
the
union,
where
the
federal
government
started
out
owning
70
or
80
percent
of
the
land
in
the
state?
justice
rehnquist
but
the
county's
tax
base
derives
ultimately
from
the
authority
of
the
alaska
legislature,
does
it
not?
justice
rehnquist
you
do
concede
that
there
is
a
general
policy
against
implied
appeal
you
not?
justice
rehnquist
the
kenai
moose
range
was
established
in
'41,
wasn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
secretary
doesn't
ordinarily
turn
to
the
comptroller
general
for
legal
advice,
does
he?
