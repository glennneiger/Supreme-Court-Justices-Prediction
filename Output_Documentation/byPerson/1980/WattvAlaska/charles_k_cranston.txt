mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
charles
cranston
from
anchorage,
alaska,
representing
the
kenai
peninsula
borough.
i
think
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
addressing
the
very
question
that
justice
white
asked,
and
that
is,
is
there
not
some
justification
for
treating
differently
counties
with
reserved
land
refuge
from
those
counties
which
have
acquired
land
refuges?
and
my
answer
to
that
is,
no,
there
is
no
difference
for
treating
those
counties
differently.
and
i'll
explain
why
i
believe
that
is
the
case,
and
perhaps
with
that
we
can
understand
really
why
this
case
is
here.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
presumably
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
certainly
under
the
new
act,
'78
amendment,
acquired
lands
are
called
fee
lands,
and
those
were
lands
which
were
previously
held
in
fee
by
private
individuals
and
reacquired
by
the
government.
thus,
if
they
were
held
in
fee,
presumably
they
were
taxed.
the
reserved
lands,
on
the
other
hand,
were
always
part
of
the
public
domain
and
were
never
taxed.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
kenai
peninsula
borough
itself
we
have
a
striking
example
of
why
the
reserved
land
county
should
be
the
recipient
of
these
wildlife
refuge
revenues.
in
the
case
of
kenai
there
have
been
two
million
acres
withdrawn
from
the
tax
roll.
admittedly
those
lands
were
never
on
the
tax
roll,
but
nevertheless
two
million
acres
of
land
remain
unavailable
for
the
tax
base
of
this
borough.
if
we
apply
conservative
property
tax
estimates,
that
will
equal
anywhere
from
six
to
$10
million
a
year
of
tax
revenues.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am.
i
am
assuming
a
very
low
appraisal
of
$100
an
acre
and
a
very
low
mill
rate
of
from
three
to
five
mills,
which
is
roughly
within
the
range
of
the
current
tax
rate
in
that
borough.
now,
considering
the
fact
that
this
wildlife
refuge
has
development,
oil
and
gas
development,
which
requires
services
such
as
fire
protection,
it
of
course
increases
the
population
of
the
borough,
schools,
the
development
in
essence
adds
to
the
load
on
the
borough
to
provide
public
services.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
it
could
be,
justice
rehnquist,
in
that
i
believe
it's
unusual
in
all
of
the
public
domain
to
have
development
of
that
public
domain,
which
adds
to
the
services
which
the
local
government
must
provide.
that
is
to
say,
simply,
if
you
have
grazing
on
blm
grazing
land,
that
doesn't
necessarily
increase
the
type
of
intensive
use
of
the
land
that
requires
additional
services
which
normally
are
provided
by
the
county's
tax
base.
and
so
i
believe
that
in
the
case
of
oil
development,
albeit
on
a
wildlife
refuge,
there
is
a
legitimate
reason
for
treating
the
county
with
a
reserved
refuge
the
same
as
one
with
an
acquired
refuge,
because
the
net
result
is
the
same.
you
have
the
development,
you
have
the
increased
population,
you
have
the
need
to
provide
the
services,
there
is
no
difference
in
rationale
as
to
why
one
should
be
treated
differently
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
county
and
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
revenue
obligation
of
the
county,
that
is
the
threat
to
the
county's
revenues
and
the
threat
to
the
county's
tax
base.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
alaska
legislature
has
permitted
counties
to
tax
land
as
well
as
improvements,
and
it
is
certainly
expected
that
when
the
land
itself
is
taken
out
of
the
tax
base,
there
certainly
is
significant
reduction
in
available
tax
revenue
to
the
county.
that
is,
it
may
only
then
tax
the
improvements,
and
in
the
case
of
an
acquired
refuge,
the
county,
as
in
plaquemines
parish,
louisiana,
is
a
good
example,
may
tax
both
the
land
and
improvements
and
there
is
really
no
reason
why
one
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
the
other.
and
i
think
this
is
what
congress
recognized
certainly
in
the
1964
amendment,
when
if
you
read
the
statute,
if
one
were
asked
to
draft
a
statute
which
gave
authority
to
the
secretary
to
transmit
25
percent
of
reserved
land
refuges
revenues
to
the
counties,
and
25
percent
of
acquired
land
refuge
revenues,
you
couldn't
come
up
with
language
any
different
from
that
which
appears
in
the
act.
and
i
believe
congress
must
have
recognized
the
similarity
of
result
both
as
to
acquired
and
as
to
reserved
land
refuges.
thus,
again
going
to
the
question
with
which
i
started
this
argument,
there
is
really
no
basis
upon
which
to
distinguish
between
the
two
types.
and
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
question
which
justice
rehnquist
did
ask
early
in
this
argument,
is
it
not
close
to
a
coin
toss
as
to
how
these
statutes
should
be
interpreted?
and
again
i
would
answer
that
question
by
saying,
no,
it
is
not
close
to
a
coin
toss.
i
think
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
and
the
wildlife
refuge
sharing
act
are
clearly
inconsistent.
you
can't
have
one
and
the
other.
there
has
to
be
a
choice,
either
the
mineral
leasing
act
applies,
or
the
wildlife
refuge
sharing
act
applies.
and
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
has
stated,
and
most
recently
in
sec
v.
sloan,
that
where
there
is
a
clear
inconsistency
between
the
statutes
involved,
that
apart
from
any
express
indication
of
congressional
intent,
there
is
an
implied
repeal
of
at
least
the
inconsistent
provisions.
now,
we
certainly
aren't
saying
that
all
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
goes.
that
of
course
is
not
the
case.
but
certainly
those
provisions
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
which
allocate
revenues
between
the
counties
and
the
federal
government
must
apply
in
this
case,
since
otherwise
you
have
the
clear
inconsistency.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
certainly,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
many
times,
but
the
exception
to
that
policy
against
implied
repeal
is
certainly
pointed
out
most
strongly
by
this
case,
where
there
is
such
a
clear
inconsistency
between
those
statutes,
and
given
that
inconsistency,
i
believe
that
consistent
with
sloan--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--certainly
interior
in
its
early
letters,
when
this
act
came
before
congress
in
1962,
added
the
word
"minerals",
and
called
it
a
perfecting
amendment.
i
think
there
are
probably
two
answers
to
the
question,
your
honor.
one
is
that
the
amendment
was
simply
recognizing
what
had
been
at
least
the
idea
or
the
concept
of
interior
before
the
1964
amendment,
and
that's
reflected
in
numerous
memoranda
which
are
in
the
appendix.
i
won't
refer
them,
but
i
think
they've
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
secondly,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
effect
of
the
perfecting
amendment
did
not
filter
down
to
those
individuals
in
the
fish
and
wildlife
service,
principally
in
alaska,
people
who
were
responsible
for
administering
the
law.
i
think
my
only
explanation
can
be
that
there
was
an
administrative
oversight
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
certainly
inconsistent
with
the
desires
of
congress.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
it
certainly
made
a
change
with
respect
to
ultimately
how
the
revenues
were
to
be
distributed.
i
would
not
concede
that
it
made
a
fundamental
change
in
the
overall
statutory
scheme,
since
before
the
1964
amendment
there
was
certainly
reason
to
believe
that
mineral
revenues
could
be
distributed
under
the
1935
act
as
provided
in
the
1964
act.
that
is,
that
simply
it
was...
just
that.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
i
don't...
well--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--certainly
the
people
who
wrote
the
checks
didn't
follow
the
act.
now,
what
they
thought,
i
don't
know,
because--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--okay.
certainly,
before
1964
that's
true.
they
did
not
think,
or
at
least
give
expression
to
what
the
act
could
have
permitted.
but
again
let
me
point
out
that
there
was
never
any
explanation
of
why
they
did
what
they
did
until
1975,
and
when
it
was
first
brought
to
the
attention
of
those
people
who
could
explain
what
was
being
done,
the
explanation
was
consistent
with
both
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
today
and
by
the
kenai
peninsula
borough.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
a
difficult
question
for
me
to
answer,
but
i...
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
i
assume
that
there
may
have
been
other
instances
where
positions
have
changed.
but
certainly
there's
nothing
wrong
in...
yes?
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
a
borough,
justice
white,
is
exactly
the
same
as
a
county,
say
in
maryland
or
virginia.
it
has
rather
broad
area
wide--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--a
county,
unlike...
perhaps
the
unique
thing
about
an
alaska
borough
is
it
is
a
self
chosen
local
government.
that
is
all
of
alaska
is
not
divided--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--into
boroughs.
it's
done
by
local
option
under
statutory
authority.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
it
may.
it
may
have
home
rule
authority
if
the
populace
wants
that.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that
is
a
question
that
may
be
difficult.
i
would
say
that
if--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--there's
certainly,
i
think,
under
the
alaska
constitution,
nothing
that
grants
a
constitutional
right
for
the
existence
of
a--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--that
is
conceivably
possible,
your
honor,
although
i
think
that
would
be
true
in
any
other
state
as
well
as
alaska.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
again,
i
think
the
simple
answer
is
that
we
have
two
inconsistent
statutes
and
until
that
is
done
there
is
no
other
alternative.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--the
county
has
a
right
to
the
money
under
federal
law.
i'm
not
certain
that
that
could
happen,
and
i
certainly
have
not
briefed
that
point.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
probably
the
borough
would
get
considerably
less
than
that
which
it
would
be
entitled
to
under
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act.
the
state
of
alaska
now
has
roughly,
under
the
latest
census,
400,000
persons.
i
think
the
kenai
borough
might
have
20,000.
so
the
percentage
of--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
--right.
and
i'd
say
it's
a
fair
statement
that
these
revenues
are
probably
distributed
on
a
somewhat
per
capita
basis.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
