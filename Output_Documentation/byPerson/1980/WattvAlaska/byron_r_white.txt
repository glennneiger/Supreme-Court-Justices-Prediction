justice
white
mr.
claiborne,
isn't
there
some
real
basis,
though,
for
treating
acquired
lands
and
domain
lands
differently
with
respect
to
how
much
of
a
share
of
the
royalty
should
go
to
a
county?
justice
white
--well,
there
would
be
a
basis
for
doing
it.
justice
white
after
all,
acquired
lands
does
reduce
the
county's
tax
base.
justice
white
well,
the
'64
amendments
were
aimed
at
facilitating
the
acquisition
of
lands?
justice
white
it
doesn't...
perhaps
the
county
might
be
entitled
to
share
more
heavily
with
respect
to
acquired
lands
but
how
about
the
public
domain
lands,
that
they
never
were
taxing
anyway?
justice
white
--well,
mr.
cranston,
let
me
ask
you
one
you
probably,
won't
be
hard
for
you
to
answer.
what's
the
status
of
a
county
or
a
borough
in
alaska?
justice
white
well,
is
it
a
creature
of
the
state?
it's
a
creature
of
the
state,
i
suppose,
and
it
has
the
powers...
are
they
constitutionally
granted
powers
or
are
they
legislative?
justice
white
it's
a
home
rule
sort
of
thing?
justice
white
does
it
sort
of
have
home
rule
authority?
justice
white
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
could
the
alaska
legislature,
at
least
prospectively,
require
the
boroughs
or
counties
to
turn
over
their
revenues
from
oil
and
gas
leases
to
the
state?
justice
white
if
the
state
is
ultimately
responsible,
if
it
determined
to
take
over,
say,
the
financing
of
all
the
schools
throughout
the
state
and
decided
to
take
all
the
revenues
from
oil
and
gas
leases
into
the
state
treasury
and
then
redistribute
them,
would
there
be
some
barrier
to
that?
justice
white
so
that,
if
the
powers
that
be
in
alaska
want
to
change
the
result
of
this
case,
either
way
it
went,
i
suppose,
nothing
we
could
do
about
it.
justice
white
i
just
wonder
why
we're
having
to
settle
a
fight
between
the
county
and
the
state
here
when
you
could
settle
it
yourself;
the
state
legislature
could
settle
it.
justice
white
but
the
state
legislature
could...
it
sounds
like
they
control
the
distribution
no
matter
what
the
federal
law
said.
justice
white
i
wouldn't
if
i
were
you.
justice
white
i
suppose
congress
could
change
the
formula
now,
too,
couldn't
it?
justice
white
oh,
i
know,
they
could
do
it;
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
white
well,
i
would
think,
if
you
think
it's
a
substantial
question,
your
argument
would
be
that
the
'64
amendments
were
unconstitutional,
if
construed
to
change
the
distribution.
justice
white
well,
what
if
it
isn't?
what
if
we
disagree
with
you?
justice
white
well,
you
haven't
raised
that,
have
you,
anywhere?
justice
white
have
you
ever
resisted
the
government's
case
on
the
ground
that
congress
has
no
power
to
change
the
distribution
of
the
revenues
from
reserved
lands?
justice
white
well,
i
didn't
suggest
that
they
could
change
the
distribution
between
the
united
states
and
alaska.
justice
white
i
think
it
would
be
your
interest.
justice
white
well,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
alaska
legislature
would
be
disentitled
if
you
won
this
case
to
take
the
25
percent
that
would
go
to
the
county?
justice
white
you
probably
don't
even
have
an
opinion
on
that.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
does
the
word
"mineral"
or
does
the
addition
of
the
word...
would
the
addition
of
the
word
"mineral"
have
any
meaning
whatsoever
if
the
state
wins
this
case?
justice
white
would
it
affect,
would
it
add
something,
would
it
change
the
distribution
of
any
other?
justice
white
mineral
besides
oil
and
gas?
justice
white
well,
so
you
answer
yes,
if
there
were
gold
and
silver
discovered,
the
word
"minerals"
would
have
some
meaning
besides
oil
and
gas?
