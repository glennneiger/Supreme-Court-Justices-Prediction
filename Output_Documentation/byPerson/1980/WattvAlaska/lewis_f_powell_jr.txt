justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
kenai
national
moose
range
is
a
national
wildlife
refuge
created
from
public
lands
in
alaska.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
many
years
had
granted
oil
and
gas
leases
within
the
range.
the
question
in
this
case
concerns
entitlement
to
royalties
received
under
these
leases.
the
question
arises
because
of
facial
conflict
between
two
statutes
enacted
by
congress.
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
and
a
formula
consistently
applied
until
--
from
the
1950s
until
1975,
alaska
received
90%
of
the
revenue
and
the
united
states
government
10%.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
now
relies
on
a
1964
amendment
to
a
later
statute,
the
wildlife
refuge
sharing
act.
on
its
face
this
statute
allocates
25%
of
the
revenue
to
counties
in
which
the
refuge
is
located
and
75%
to
the
united
states.
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
repeal
the
earlier
statute
by
implication,
we
conclude
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
the
original
allocation
of
revenue
remains
in
effect.
this
is
entirely
consistent
with
administrative
interpretation
that
continued
until
1975.
we
therefore
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
