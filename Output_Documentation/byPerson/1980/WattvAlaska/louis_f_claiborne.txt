mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
deal
this
morning
with
the
kenai
moose
range
which
i
am
told
has
been
renamed
the
kenai
national
wildlife
refuge
a
month
ago
in
the
enacted
alaska
lands
bill.
that
range
or
refuge
is
in
south
central
alaska,
just
south
of
anchorage,
and
east
of
cook
inlet.
it
comprises
approximately
two
million
acres
of
lands,
all
within
the
kenai
peninsula
borough,
boroughs
in
alaska
being
comparable
to
counties
elsewhere.
it
was
established
by
withdrawal
of
public
domain
or
public
lands
in
the
united
states,
some
40
years
ago.
ever
since
the
mid-1950s
oil
and
gas
leases
have
been
issued
by
the
united
states
covering
portions
of
that
acreage
and
substantial
revenues
have
been
derived
therefrom.
indeed,
since
1965
approximately
$80
million
in
royalties,
rents,
and
bonuses
have
accrued
from
those
leases.
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
is
how
those
federal
revenues
from
this
refuge
ought
to
be
distributed,
whether
according
to
the
formula
in
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920,
as
alaska
maintains,
which
would
have
the
result
of
apportioning
90
percent,
in
the
particular
case
of
alaska,
to
the
state
and
ten
percent
retained
in
the
federal
treasury;
or
whether
the
appropriate
formula
is
that
ordained
by
the
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act,
an
act
originally
passed
in
1935
and
amended
in
1964,
relevant
to
this
case.
according
to
that
formula,
the
same
revenues
would
be
divided
25
percent
to
the
county
out
of
which
these
lands
have
been
created,
or
this
refuge
has
been
created,
and
the
remainder,
75
percent,
would
go
to
the
conservation
fund.
in
practice,
the
first
formula,
the
formula
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920,
was
followed.
and
indeed,
until
anyone
thought
about
it,
which
was
so
far
as
the
record
indicates
for
the
first
time
in
1975,
that
distribution
formula
obtained.
at
that
time,
in
1975,
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
in
alaska
wondered
to
itself,
and
then
out
loud,
whether
the
right
formula
was
being
applied.
they
accordingly
inquired
of
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
the
interior
for
advice.
he
gave
the
opinion
that
it
was
being
done
wrongly
and
that
the
formula
of
the
refuge
act,
25
percent
to
the
county,
is
the
one
that
should
have
obtained
at
least
since
1964.
he,
in
turn,
the
solicitor,
asked
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
general
of
the
united
states.
the
comptroller
general
agreed
with
the
solicitor
and
ruled
accordingly.
alaska
then
asked
for
reconsideration
of
that
opinion,
which
was
duly
given,
but
the
comptroller
general
adhered
to
his
view
and
reaffirmed
his
previous
ruling.
at
this
point
the
kenai
peninsula
borough
would
have
been
the
recipient
under
the
refuge
act
and
who
would
now
become
the
recipient
under
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
general,
brought
suit
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
comptroller
was
indeed
correct
and
that
his
decision
ought
to
be
followed;
and
also
asking
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
be
required
to
recoup
the
monies
now
determined
to
have
been
erroneously
paid
to
alaska
rather
than
to
the
county
in
the
previous
decade.
promptly
thereafter
the
state
of
alaska
initiated
a
separate
lawsuit
against
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
and
the
comptroller
general,
seeking
to
set
aside
the
ruling
of
the
comptroller
general
and
to
obtain
a
declaration
and
an
injunction
that
the
old
formula
that
had
been
followed
in
practice
should
continue
to
be
followed,
and
that
alaska
should
continue
to
receive
90
percent
of
these
revenues.
the
suits
were
consolidated
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
meantime
the
monies
accruing
from
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
suits
were
held
in
suspense,
where
they
still
are.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
the
government
resisted
the
complaint
of
kenai
seeking
to
compel
that
action.
the
ruling
having
gone
against
the
government
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
there's
been
no
occasion
to
consider
whether,
should
that
ruling
be
reversed
here,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
seek
recoupment,
in
our
view
it's
a
decision
which
the
government
is
free
to
embark
upon
but
cannot
be
compelled
to
undertake.
no
decision
has
been
reached
with
respect
to
what
i've--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
is
so,
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
may
well
be
that
the
appropriate
course
would
be
for
the
united
states
to
bring
an
action,
if
necessary,
to
recoup
that
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
borough.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
without
being
able
to
cite
precedents,
that
one
can
find
examples
on
both
sides;
that
is,
cases
in
which
the
united
states
for
reasons
of
equity
thought
it
improper
to
seek
to
redress
the
past;
other
instances
in
which
it
was
thought
right
to
recoup
the
money
and
redistribute
it
in
accordance
with
what
is
now
declared
to
be
the
correct
rule.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
not
have
thought
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
own
that
two
courts
have
held
against
our
position
and
we
cannot
therefore
say
that
it's
absolutely
clear
cut
that
the
government's
view
as
announced
by
the
comptroller
general
and
as
we
urge
here
is
the
correct
one.
i
do
invoke
the
plain
meaning
rule
as
the
governing
canon
of
construction
in
this
case
and
this
seems
in
our
submission
a
peculiarly
appropriate
instance
in
which
congress
spoke
as
clearly
as
one
could
hope
for,
much
more
clearly
than
is
the
usual
case,
and
one
in
which
one
ought
to
accept
congress
at
its
word.
and
if
one
follows
that
analysis
which
we
submit
is
the
correct
one,
then
the
case
is
indeed
plain
that
an
error
has
been
committed
for
these
ten
years
and
perhaps
under
those
circumstances
the
proper
remedy
is
to
redress
that
past
error.
we
are
not
speaking
of
the
individual
private
persons
who
have
relied
to
their
detriment
on
the
error
of
the
administrator
who
is
speaking
of
a
state
whose
mineral
revenues
are
so
generous
that
they
are
able
to
repay
their
own
citizens.
at
all
events,
as
the
court
well
knows,
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
secretary,
despite
finding
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
was
as
contended
for,
but
holding
in
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
most
unusual
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
word
"minerals",
though
in
the
statute
apparently
applicable
to
both
refuges
made
up
of
acquired
land
and
those
made
up
of
public
domain
lands,
must
be
construed
by
a
judicial
decree
with
the
words
of
the
statute
so
as
to
apply
only
in
the
one
case
and
not
in
the
other,
the
reasoning
behind
that
being
that
this
would
accomplish
no
change
in
the
law
and
that
there
was
insufficient
indication
that
congress
by
adding
the
word
"minerals"
to
the
revenue
sharing
act
meant
to
accomplish
any
change
of
the
law.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
decision,
basically
on
the
same
reasoning.
now
this
case
reaches
the
courts,
and
at
least
this
court,
only
because
of
two
circumstances
that
occurred
after
the
relevant
statute
had
been
enacted;
unfortunately,
not
such
rare
occurrences,
but
still
unfortunate.
the
first
is
that
the
department
of
the
interior
was
very
slow
in
implementing
the
change
of
law,
if
that's
what
it
was,
which
had
occurred
in
1964.
the
second
was
that
congress,
though
having
a
clear
opportunity
to
indicate
which
was
the
correct
view
of
their
own
statute,
expressly
declined
that
invitation
in
1978
and
said,
since
the
matter
is
before
the
court,
we
will
let
the
courts
decide
what
we
meant
in
1964
rather
than
resolving
it
themselves
and
sparing
this
and
the
other
courts
the
need
for
resolution.
now
the
statute
on
its
face,
everyone
has
agreed,
at
least
until
alaska
filed
its
brief
in
this
court,
was
perfectly
plain.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
authority
as
understood
by
the
department
and
indeed
as
recited
in
rulings
of
the
solicitor
is
that
the
so
called
wildlife
refuge
revenue
sharing
act
as
originally
enacted
in
1935
does
authorize
the
secretary...
and,
indeed,
the
words
are
reasonably
clear
to
that
end...
does
authorize
the
secretary
to
grant
sales
or
dispositions,
which
in
this
context
are
understood
to
include
leases,
of
those
products...
in
the
case
of
some
of
the
products
it's
an
outright
sale,
but
in
other
instances
it's
leases...
with
respect
to
both
refuges
made
up
of
acquired
lands
and
those
made
up
of
public
domain
lands,
without
distinction.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
suggest
that
that
is
a
possible
construction
of
the
1935
act,
even
before
its
amendment,
and
indeed
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
acting
solicitor
of
the
department
of
the
interior
in
1946,
before
the
acquired
lands
act
had
been
passed,
and
therefore
the
only
authority
then
available
with
respect
to
mineral
leases
on
acquired
lands.
he
read
the
word
1935
refuge
act
as
including
the
lease
for
oil
and
gas
on
acquired
lands.
if
it
applied
to
acquired
lands,
it
likewise
applied
to
public
domain
lands,
though
unnecessarily,
since
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
was
already
available
for
that
purpose.
we
do
not
deem
it
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
that
question,
that
is,
what
the
law
was
before
1964,
because
in
1964
congress
added
the
word
"minerals"
to
those
revenues
which
could
be
leased,
those
resources
which
could
be
leased,
and
the
revenues
from
mineral
leases
as
among
those
that
ought
to
be
distributed
according
to
the
formula
of
the
act.
and
it
was
that
very
plain
action
of
adding
the
word
"minerals"
that
moots
out
the
question--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
certainly
neater,
if
that's
an
appropriate
word,
if
the
same
statute
both
gives
the
authority
and
governs
the
distribution
of
revenues.
i
would
point
out
that
all
leases
of
public
lands
are
distributed,
or
granted,
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
so
far
as
the
mechanics
are
concerned,
whether
they're
acquired
lands
or
not.
the
acquired
lands
act,
for
instance,
simply
says,
you
may
apply
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
to
acquired
lands
as
you
have
been
doing
with
respect
to
other
lands.
i
have--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
white,
that
may
have
been
the
thought,
but
as--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--there
would.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but,
considering
the
revenues
from
all
other
sources,
all
clearly
divided
under
the
refuge
act,
whether
from
acquired
or
from
public
domain
lands,
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
mineral
revenues,
that
is,
oil
and
gas
revenues,
should
be
segregated
for
different
treatment.
now,
there
is
a
different
formula.
it's
not
simply
25
percent
in
the
case
of
acquired
lands.
there
are
two
other
options
available,
more
generous
options
potentially,
and
in
practice
seem
to
be
more
generous,
than
with
respect
to
the
lands
that
are
in
refuges
that
come
from
the
public
domain.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
was
plainly
the
main
purpose
of
the
'64
amendment.
but
quite
incidentally
two
other
things
were
done.
one
was
to
authorize
expressly
the
granting
of
leases
of
public
buildings
and
public
accommodations,
and
having
those
revenues
distributed
pursuant
to
the
refuge
act,
something
the
comptroller
general
had
ruled
could
not
be
done;
and
then
tying
up
this
problem
about
minerals
that
was
ambiguous
before.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
do
receive
a
share
of
all
other
revenues,
and
it's
difficult
to
appreciate
why
they
shouldn't
receive
a
like
share
of
mineral
revenues.
because
one
could
argue
that
the
state
receives
it
for
their
benefit
in
any
event,
but
why
should
they
not
receive
it
directly
in
the
locality?
i
am
trespassing
on
the
time
of
my
co
counsel,
and
will
allow
him
to
continue.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
in
answer
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
draw
the
justice's
attention
to
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
2a.
this
is
a
part
of
the
affidavit
of
the
director
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
paragraph
3
of
that
affidavit
indicates
that
the
mineral
revenues
generated
by
all
wildlife
refuges
consists
entirely
of
oil
and
gas
revenues.
that
apparently
has
always
been
true
and
is
true
as
of
the
date
of
this
affidavit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
the
word
"mineral"
here
is
used
as
meaning
mineral
other
than
sand
and
gravel
specified
in
the
wildlife
revenue
sharing
act,
though
i
don't
for
a
fact
know
that
there
was
any
such
revenue
even
though
it's
specified.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
mr.
justice
white
suggested
that
the
alaska
legislature
could
resolve
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
be
enormous--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
enormous
difference
is
it
goes
between
the
90
percent
and
the
25
percent,
whoever
it
goes
to
in
alaska.
i
would
add
that
it
is
a
case
which
is
entirely
appropriate
for
congress,
the
national
congress,
to
resolve,
but
it
has
declined
the
invitation
to
do
so
when
the
matter
was
very
clearly
put
before
it
in--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
suppose
the
duty
of
the
secretary
would
be
to
pay
to
the
county.
whether
the
county
was
then
required
by
alaska
law
to
turn
it
over--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
would
not
be
our
concern;
that
is
so.
but
i
do
think
the
secretary
must
first
obey
the
federal
law
and
pay
it
to
the
county--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--whatever
the
county
is
then
required
to
do.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
approach
this
court
ought
to
take
is
that
congress
ought
to
be
held
to
its
word
if
the
consequences
of
what
it
wrote
or
not,
as
it
intended
it,
and
we
think
they
probably
are,
then
congress
has
an
easy
opportunity
to
amend
the
act.
but
this
court
ought
not
torture
the
text
to
guess
what
congress
may
or
may
not
have
been
doing
in
changing
or
not
changing
the
law
in
1964.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
accomplish
precisely
nothing
because
it
would
simply
confirm
the
formula
already
enacted
by
the
mineral
leasing
act--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--nothing
whatever,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
be
entirely
surplusage,
unless
it
applies
to
reserved
lands.
because
at
least
all
minerals
covered
by
the
minerals
leasing
act
for
acquired
lands
in
1947,
or
by
that
act,
required
to
be
distributed
under
the
refuge
act
formula...
now...
gold
and
silver
night
present
a
separate
question.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
though
no
one,
in
the
'64...
or
'62
debates,
ever
suggested
that
there
was
gold
and
silver
to
be
found
on
this
refuge.
the
only
mineral
ever
spoken
of
was
oil
and
gas,
and
everyone
knew
that
the
word
"mineral"
in
that
context
meant
oil
and
gas.
