we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
andrus
v.
alaska
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
claiborne,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
have
there
been
occasions,
mr.
claiborne,
where
the
united
states
had
this
type
of
a
claim
in
broad
terms
and
took
no
action
to
enforce
the
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cranston.
chief
justice
burger
just
by
way
of
definition,
to
clarify
it
for
me
at
least,
when
you
speak
of
the
term
"acquired
lands",
are
those
always
lands
which
have
been
on
the
tax
rolls
before
they
were
acquired?
chief
justice
burger
are
you
relating
that
to
current
rates
of
tax
in
that
area?
chief
justice
burger
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
department
of
interior
has
had
a
change
in
position
from
one
period
to
another,
is
it?
or,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
put
that
to
you,
since
you're
not
responsible
for
the
department
of
interior.
but
in
the
oil
shale
case
we
had
exactly--

judgments
and

will
