justice
blackmun
does
that
make
any
difference?
suppose
they
did
not
make
that
concession,
would
you
be
arguing
the
same
way
here
today?
justice
blackmun
i
take
it
you
anticipate
a
more
sympathetic
jury
the
second
go-around?
justice
blackmun
even
though
a
harder-nosed
jury
didn't
give
your
man
the
death
penalty?
justice
blackmun
well,
you'd
like
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
wouldn't
you?
justice
blackmun
you're
the
one
who
is
asking
for
the
second
bite,
the
state
didn't
ask
for
the
second
bite.
justice
blackmun
counsel,
doesn't
your
argument
really
get
down,
as
so
many
of
these
cases
do,
to
the
proposition
that
death
is
different?
justice
blackmun
well,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
the
authorities
seem
to
be
against
you
on
most
of
the
procedural
points.
justice
blackmun
of
course,
that
happened
in
stroud
too.
justice
blackmun
well,
then
you're
getting
back
to
the
basic
proposition
which
i
think
is
yours,
that
death
is
different.
