justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sindel,
what
if
your
client
had
been
convicted
by
the
jury
or
the
judge
and
sentenced
to
the
death
penalty
in
the
first
proceeding
and
it
was
set
aside
on
the
duren
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sindel,
in
your
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question
a
moment
ago
you
said
the
jury
expressly
found
that
death
would
be
an
inappropriate
sentence
in
this
case.
was
there
a
written
interrogatory
or
written
special
verdict
to
that
effect,
or
are
you
simply
relying
on
the
fact
that
they
came
in
with
a
life
sentence
rather
than
the
death
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
original
conviction
had
been
reversed
for
failure
to
suppress
testimony
secured
in
violation
of
miranda?
would
you
say
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
barred
retrial
with
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
our
decision
in
united
states
v.
scott?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
jury
convicts,
an
appellate
court
reverses,
because
there
was
improperly
admitted
evidence
in
violation
of
miranda?
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
situation
where
you
have
another
panel
of
12
jurors
and
this
panel
of
12
jurors
happens
to
believe
three
or
four
prosecution
witnesses
that
the
earlier
panel
did
not
believe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
disagree,
do
you,
that
as
to
your
double
jeopardy
contention,
your
client
can
be
retried
on
the
same
charge,
but
the
death
penalty
not
sought?
