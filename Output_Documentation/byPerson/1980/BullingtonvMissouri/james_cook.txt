mr.
james
cook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
in
this
case...
excuse
me.
my
name
is
james
cook,
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
for
st.
louis
county
and
i
represent
the
respondent,
the
state
of
missouri.
petitioner
in
this
court
has
asked
this
court
to
do
certain
things,
but
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
death
penalty
is
a
legitimate
state
interest,
and
if
jury
sentencing
is
a
legitimate
state
interest,
and
if
as
a
general
principle
increased
sentences
on
retrial
does
not
go
against
the
constitution
as
long
as
we
protect
against
vindictiveness,
then
there
should
be
no
prohibition
against
a
state
seeking
the
death
penalty
in
this
particular
case.
we
believe
that
what
the
petitioner
asks
this
court
to
do
basically
is
to
overrule
stroud,
pearce,
chaffin,
and
di
francesco,
at
the
very
least.
first
position
is
that
the
procedure
that
we
now
have
for
death
penalty
cases,
that
being
the
bifurcation,
makes
the
sentencing
like
a
decision
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
james
cook
if
they
come
back
with
the
death
penalty,
they
must
state
which
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
they
have
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
if
they
come
back
with
life,
we
don't
know
if
they
found
that
aggravating
circumstances
existed,
so
as
to
ignore--
mr.
james
cook
--right.
we
don't
know.
mr.
james
cook
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
a
problem
here.
i
think
you'd
have
a
problem--
mr.
james
cook
--i
think
so.
mr.
james
cook
i
believe
so.
particularly
in
light
of--
mr.
james
cook
--i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that
on
one
hand
you
could
say
res
judicata.
mr.
james
cook
on
the
other
hand,
though,
this
court
has
approved
the
statutory
theory
of
florida
which
is
that
even
if
the
jury
doesn't
find
the
aggravating
circumstances,
the
judge
can.
so
i
think
that--
mr.
james
cook
--i
don't
want
to
say
i'm
relying
on
that
but
i
do
assume
that.
what
i'm
relying
on
is
that
the
procedure
alone
does
not
make
this
into
a
decision
like--
mr.
james
cook
--right.
i
believe
my
position
is
easier
because
of
the
way
the
jury
system
is
set
up,
the
instructions
under
the
general
verdict
type
of
approach
to
the
specific
verdicts.
but
i
think
that
you
still
need
to
look
at
the
policy
behind
why
we
apply
double
jeopardy.
we
apply
double
jeopardy
not
really
because
of
the
finality,
or
repose,
or
the
other
things
that
we've
talked
about.
i
submit
that
this
court
has
suggested
or
found
that
we
apply
double
jeopardy
in
order
basically
to
protect
the
individual
against
government
oppression.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
in
a
way
an
exception
to
our
basic
legal
system,
which
is
to
find
the
truth
by
having
your
day
in
court
and
making
sure
on
appeal
that
that
day
in
court
was
done
properly.
and
under
that
system
you
would
say,
well,
the
state
should
be
able
to
check
and
have
an
appeal
to
make
sure
that
was
done
properly.
but
we
cannot
protect
against
government
oppression
and
still
do
that
so
we
make
a
blanket
exception
to
that
and
put
it
in
the
bill
of
rights
and
say,
okay,
the
state
only
gets
one
shot.
but
we
do
give
exceptions
to
that
by
saying,
if
the
defendant
appeals,
the
slate
is
wiped
clean.
we
don't
say
that
in
a
way
of
vindictiveness.
we
say
that
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
is
only
the
defendant
that
can
set
aside
a
conviction.
and
of
course
he
wouldn't
be
interested
in
setting
aside
an
acquittal.
so
that
when
you
would
take
this
policy
and
you
try
to
apply
it
to
the
sentencing
procedures,
or
sentencing
at
all,
as
was
recognized
in
several
of
the
recent
cases,
it
doesn't
apply.
because
you
have
said,
or
this
court
has
said
that
there's
no
absolute
bar
against
increasing
a
sentence.
the
only
concern
we
have
against
increasing
a
sentence
is
to
protect
against
vindictiveness.
and
we
say,
in
a
judge
sentencing
situation,
we
have
to
do
that
by
adding
the
pearce
limitations,
but
in
the
jury
sentencing
situation
we
don't
have
that
concern.
there
is
not
that
concern
about
vindictiveness,
so
we
don't
need
to
have
the
double
jeopardy
applying
to
sentences.
therefore,
i
think
this
procedure
does
not
make
this
into
an
acquittal.
bifurcation
is
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant,
it
is
not
meant
to
give
the
sentencing
a
greater
finality
than
it
ever
had
before.
mr.
james
cook
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
cook
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
cook
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
cook
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
it's...
that
argument
certainly
has
been
made
by
members
of
this
court
here
and
i
just
think
that
it
is,
when
you
look
beyond
that
argument,
behind
it,
you
see
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
differences
in
sentencing
and
differences
in
offenses--
mr.
james
cook
--i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
that
is
entitled
and
what
is--
mr.
james
cook
--what
happens.
mr.
james
cook
that's
right.
mr.
james
cook
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
cook
because--
mr.
james
cook
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
cook
if...
well,
that's
not
correct.
you
see
he
was
not
put
in
jeopardy
about
being
killed
again.
he
is
put
in
jeopardy...
he's
never
lost
jeopardy
or
he
was
put
in
jeopardy
again
when
his
case
was--
mr.
james
cook
--well,
that
is
true
if
you
assume,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
jeopardy
applies
to
sentencing.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
past.
mr.
james
cook
i
see.
well,
if
the
degree
of
the
crime
is
different,
then,
yes,
jeopardy
would
have
attached
and
he
would
not
be
able
to
be
charged
with
that.
but
then
after
he--
mr.
james
cook
--yes.
mr.
james
cook
no.
mr.
james
cook
no.
i
see
what
you're
saying
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
rejected
that
argument.
there
is
a
difference
between
sentencing
and
the
offense,
and
although
death
is
unique,
certainly,
and
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
is
available
on
one
case
certainly
makes
it
unique,
i
think
that
there
has
been
this
historic
distinction
made
between
what
you
call
an
offense
and
what
you
call
a
sentencing.
mr.
james
cook
i
understand.
mr.
james
cook
yes.
mr.
james
cook
petitioner
mentions
that
death
is
unique
and
therefore
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
can
distinguish
this
case
from
stroud,
or
certainly,
pearce
and
chaffin,
and
di
francesco,
even.
i
would
suggest
that,
and
agree,
that
that
is
unique,
that
the
death
penalty
is
very
unique
and
this
court
has
bent
over
backwards,
perhaps,
to
put
out
extra
special
procedures
for
making
extra
care
that
the
death
penalty
is
only
imposed
in
certain
specific
situations.
but
the
uniqueness
of
death
does
not
allow
it
to
change
the
basic
rules
of
law
called
double
jeopardy
and
due
process
and
equal
protection,
and
that
is
what
petitioner
asks
you
to
do,
and
asks
you
to
say
as
far
as
stroud
and
chaffin
and
pearce
that
in
all
cases
except
death
penalty
cases
double
jeopardy
means
thus-and-such,
but
in
death
penalty
cases
it
means
something
else.
i
don't
think
you
can
do
that,
because
i
think
that
whittles
away
at
the
underpinnings
of
the
whole
legal
system,
which
is
the
due
process
clause,
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
other
matter
that--
mr.
james
cook
--i
think
so;
yes.
mr.
james
cook
i
think
the
due
process
clause
comes
in
here
under
the
vindictiveness
issue.
certainly
that
was
the
understanding
in
the
pearce
case.
mr.
james
cook
i
believe
so.
but
we
worry
about
vindictiveness
as
it
applies
to
the
sentencing
by
the
jury--
mr.
james
cook
--yes,
pearce
does
net
apply
because
it's
a
jury
sentencing
and
that's
chaffin
and
that's
indicated
that
the
concern
that
caused
us
to
set
the
limits.
mr.
james
cook
no.
i
think
that
this
court
has
historically
in
applying
due
process
made
sure
that
certain
procedures
are
followed,
that
certain
laws
not
be
allowed
to
take
away
the
defendant's
due
process,
but
it
did
not
change
due
process,
which
is
what
i
think
you
have
to
do
to
make
an
exception
for
the
uniqueness
of
death.
mr.
james
cook
yes.
i
think
so.
mr.
james
cook
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
raises
it
perhaps
too
high,
that
it
raises
it
above
the
constitutional
procedures.
mr.
james
cook
i
think
that
the
underlying
assumptions
and
findings
in
the
di
francesco
can
apply
too,
yes;
recognizing
that
sentencing
is
different,
and
whether
that
be
a
sentencing
concerning
death
or
not
does
not
make
any
difference
here.
certainly
in
other
situations
and
in
the
procedures
that
we
follow
and
the
safeguards
that
we
set
up,
it
does
make
a
difference.
mr.
james
cook
i
think
so,
because
i
think
that's
what
you
have
in
florida,
where
you
have
what
is
called
an
advisory
jury
opinion.
but
certainly
i
wouldn't
think
that
this
court
would
allow
a
state
legislature
to
just
call
something
advisory
when
in
fact
it
is
a
jury
determination
of
finding
of
death
or
life.
and
certainly,
in
that
situation,
the
judge
can
overrule
it.
now,
there
are
certain
procedural
safeguards.
mr.
james
cook
well,
sort
of.
mr.
james
cook
it
doesn't
sound
good,
but
i
don't
know
the
details.
mr.
james
cook
well,
then,
you
could...
i
don't
think
so.
it
really
doesn't
sound
very
good,
though,
because,
you
see,
the
difference,
the
difference,
i
think,
is
that
in
this
case...
in
that
case
it
is
the
government
saying,
aha,
we
want
two
shots
at--
mr.
james
cook
--no,
it's
the
defendant.
it's
the
defendant's--
mr.
james
cook
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
cook
that
is
correct.
but
it
is
the
defendant
who
has
at
his
own
behest
wiped
the
slate
clean
and
allowed
the
sentencing
to
again
come
before
the
jury.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
again,
not
because
of
being
vindictive
to
the
defendant
and
saying,
you
can't
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too,
and
by
golly,
you
asked
for
it.
mr.
james
cook
that's
correct.
mr.
james
cook
but,
again,
i
think
that
assumes
a--
mr.
james
cook
--yes.
mr.
james
cook
yes.
mr.
james
cook
i
think
so;
yes.
the
other
issues
presented
by
the
petitioner
include
the
disproportionate
and
excessiveness,
which
i'd
like
to
address
briefly.
it's
argued
that
on
one
hand
a
sentence
at
the
second
trial
of
death
would
be
automatically
disproportionate,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
so
held.
i
argue
that
that
is
just,
i
don't
feel
logical,
in
that
i
don't
think
it
was
what
was
anticipated
the
drafters
of
this
legislation
nor
by
this
court
when
it
approved
the
comparison
of
one
case
with
other
similar
cases.
i
think
that
was
authorized
or
mandated,
one,
to
protect
against
prejudicial
imposing
of
the
death
sentence,
let
us
say,
only
on
minorities,
or
only
on
poor
people;
or,
to
protect
against
the
aberrant
jury.
where
we
take
one
case
and
compare
it
with
itself,
though,
how
do
you
know
which
is
the
right
decision?
how
do
you
know
which
one
is
aberrant?
that's
just,
i
don't
think,
logical.
what
this
has
anticipated
here
is
looking
at
this
case
in
light
of
other
typical,
shall
i
say,
kidnap
murder
cases,
or
looking
at
a
holdup
murder
case.
and
if
in
several
holdup
murder
cases
or
kidnap
murder
cases
similar
to
this
the
death
penalty
was
not
imposed,
then
this
is
the
aberrant
jury.
also--
mr.
james
cook
--be
wantonly
vile,
cruel,
inhuman,
and
the
substantial
history
of
serious
assaultive
criminal
convictions.
mr.
james
cook
no.
it
was
a
prior
kidnapping
while
armed
offense,
and
a
prior
armed
robbery
offense.
and
there
were
other
nonassaultive
offenses
also.
mr.
james
cook
it's
conceded
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
identical.
the
state
will
attempt
to
present
more
evidence
on
this
issue
than
it
was
allowed
to
the
first
time
in
that
we
were
only
allowed
to
read
to
the
jury
the
stated
offense,
as
opposed
to
giving
the
jury
any
of
the
facts
of
that
case
which
would
allow
it
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
it
was
a
serious
assaultive
conviction
or
not.
but
that's
a
trial
court
decision
that
we're
going
to
try
to
change
the
trial
court's
mind
on.
i
don't
think
disproportionateness
applies,
and
excessiveness
is
also
mentioned.
i
don't
think
that
applies
either,
again
for
the
same
reason
as
i've
indicated
in
the
proffitt
decision
where
a
death
sentence
following
a
life
cannot
per
se
be
excessive.
it
may
be,
but
you
have
to
look
at
more
than
just
the
one
other
case.
there's
a
concern
here
that
this
decision
would
chill
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
seek
a
jury
trial
in
his
second
case,
and
of
course
the
petitioner
relies
on
the
jackson
decision.
it's
our
position
that
this
court
has
cited
that
issue
in
respondent's
favor
in
chaffin
where,
although
it
is
concerned
about
that,
it
felt
that
those
difficult
decisions
sometimes
have
to
be
made.
and
it
distinguished
jackson,
in
that
in
jackson
it
was
stated
that
there
was
no
other
purpose
or
result
of
that
procedure
than
to
chill
the
defendant's
right
to
a
jury
trial.
it's
our
position
that
there
is
another
purpose
or
result
in
this
procedure,
and
that
is
the
stated
and
approved
government,
or
state
interest,
in
having
jury
sentencing,
and
that
as
long
as
you
have
jury
sentencing,
and
as
long
as
that
is
considered
a
legitimate
state
interest,
then
that
is
a
legitimate
state
purpose
or
result.
also,
i
would
indicate
that
although
petitioner
indicates
that
the
defendant
would
be
absolutely
precluded
from
getting
the
death
penalty
if
he
waives
his
jury,
that
is
not
necessarily
so,
because
he
relies
on
the
fact
that
he
would
then
come
under
the
pearce
provisions
and
the
judge
could
not
give
death
unless
something
new
had
arisen.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
would
ever
be
absolutely
sure
of
that
until
the
moment
or
sentencing.
i'm
not
implying
that
anything
new
has
arisen
which
would
cause
the
judge
in
this
particular
case
to
give
the
death
penalty
but
for
the
court
to
find
that
this
chilled
his
right
because
he
would
be
absolutely
precluded
from
getting
the
death
penalty
by
the
judge
would
not
be
accurate,
because
there
may
be
those
cases
where
the
judge
could
in
fact
give
the
death
penalty.
so
the
decision
is
not
the
decision
as
it
was
in
jackson.
petitioner
also
asked
this
court
basically
to
rule
that
the
two
aggravating
circumstances
here
are
too
vague
and
overbroad.
and
the
missouri
court
has
ignored
this
court's
rulings
about
the
narrowing
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
decided
in
godfrey.
and
certainly
that
is
one
of
the
circumstances
we're
using
in
this
case.
i
would
merely
point
out
that
the
decision
below
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
was
handed
down
before
your
decision
in
godfrey,
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
decide
any
death
penalty
cases
yet
and
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
follow
this
court's
decision,
and
so
we
would
ask
that
this
court
give
the
missouri
supreme
court
the
