justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're...
what
about
in
non-death
cases,
where,
in
jury
sentencing,
and
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
sentence
of
ten
years
and
on
retrial
the
other
jury
comes
in
with
a
sentence
of
20
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
your
argument
seems
to
me
to
require
overruling
those--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
you
rely
on,
be
entitled
to
rely
on
what
this
jury
did,
when
you
say
that
jury
was
unconstitutionally
constituted
to
render
a
decent
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
you
think
it
was
enough
of
a
jury
for
you
to
hang
your
hat
on
for
an
acquittal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
just...
maybe
it's
just
an
accident
that
the
flaw
you
found
in
your
case
was
related
to
the
jury.
you
might
have
gotten
a
reversal
on
some
other
ground
that,
in
some
other
case,
which
wouldn't
involve
any
attack
on
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
your
issue
would
be
cleaner
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
don't,
and
you
must
not
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
cook,
in
missouri
is
the
jury
ever
asked
to
specifically
determine
what
aggravating
circumstances
and
what
mitigating
circumstances
they
find
present
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
may
have
found
no
aggravating
circumstances
or
they
may
have
found
that
there
were
mitigating
circumstances
that
outweighed
the
aggravating
circumstances,
or
they
just
may
have
been
merciful.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
did?
suppose
there
was
a
jury
came
in
and
said,
we
find,
we
impose
life
because
the
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
the
aggravating
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it...
could
you
then
retry
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
ask
for
death
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
said,
we
find
that
aggravating
circumstance
a
was
not
present?
could
you
then
on
retrial
press
that
same
aggravating
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
relying
mostly,
then,
on
the
fact
this
is
a
general
verdict,
and
the
jury
just
might
have
been
merciful?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
assume
that
the
jury
imposed
life
because
they
found
there
were
no
aggravating
circumstances
you
have
a
problem
about
pressing
the
same
aggravating
circumstances,
if
you
just
assumed
that
that's
what
the
jury
did.
i
would
take
your
case
as
not
so
clear
either
if
the
jury
said
there
are
both
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
but
the
mitigating
circumstances
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
state
on
retrial
says,
we're
going
to
present
precisely
the
same
evidence.
justice
white
and
sentencing
by
jury
doesn't
apply
then
sometimes?
i
mean,
pearce
doesn't
apply
to--
--that's
chaffin
v.
stynchcombe.
justice
white
you
mean
the
death
sentencing
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
if...
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
retrial
which
will
go
forward,
will
the
jury
do
the
sentencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
there
more
than
one--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
there
only
one
sentence
it
could
give
if
it
finds
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
has
no...
there's
no
discretion?
if
you
win
on
retrial
and
if
he's
found
guilty,
there
can
only
be
one
sentence?
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
on
retrial,
if
you
win,
there
will
be
no
need
to
present
to
the
jury
any
evidence
whatsoever
with
respect
to
sentencing?
justice
white
no,
no,
but
if
you
win
here
on
retrial?
justice
white
well,
there
wouldn't
be
a
separate
sentencing
proceeding
at
all?
justice
white
exactly.
