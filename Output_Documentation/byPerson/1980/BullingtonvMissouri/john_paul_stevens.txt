mr.
sindel,
let
me
ask
you
one
question,
if
i
may.
at
the
sentencing
phase,
the
jury
returned
what
was
like
a
general
verdict
of,
saying
life
imprisonment
rather
than
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
your
procedure
required
the
jury
to
make
special
verdicts,
and
they
had
found
that
pursuant
to
instruction
no.
38
even
though
the
mitigating
circumstances
do
not
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances,
as
a
matter
of
leniency
we
will
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
that
been
done
expressly,
would
you
then
have
the
same
position
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
it
says
they
are
not
obligated
to
impose
the
death
penalty
even
if
they
find
in
aggravating
circumstance
and
also
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
not
outweighed
by
the
mitigating
circumstance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
problem
with
the
instruction.
my
question
is,
what
is
your
position
if
the
jury
had
made
it,
articulated
a
basis
for
a
decision
that
it
was
pursuant
to
this
instruction
rather
than
to
any
deficiency
in
the
prosecutor's
proof?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cook,
hasn't
the
state
of
missouri
itself
taken
the
view
that
death
is
different
by
setting
up
a
special
procedure
for
imposing
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
would
it
be
necessarily
undermining
the
entire
legal
system
to
say
that
the
rules
with
respect
to
capital
sentencing
are
somewhat
different
as
a
constitutional
matter
from
the
rules
for
lesser
sentences?
and
that's
certainly
implicit
in
the
gardner
holding,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
di
francesco
holding
will
apply
to
death
cases...
to
death?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
put
the
question
more
directly,
supposing
missouri
had
a
procedure
that
if
the
jury
does
what
it
did
in
this
case,
find
no
death
penalty
is
appropriate,
would
it
be
constitutionally
permissible
for
the
state
to
say,
well,
there
shall
be
an
appeal
to
an
appellate
court
which
could
reverse
that
determination
and
decide
that,
well,
we
think
there
should
be
a
death
penalty,
evidence
of
aggravating
circumstances
are
pretty
strong,
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
procedure
that
said,
we'll
have
a
bifurcated
hearing
except
that
if
the
jury
finds
no
death
penalty
we'll
have
a
second
jury
empaneled
and
have
them
take
another
look
at
it
and
have
a
trial?
i
suppose
that'd
be
permissible
too.
to
just
specifically
say,
the
state
shall
have
two
chances
to
persuade
someone
that
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate?
that's,
i
guess,
what
they
have
in
florida.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
think
that
would
be
permissible
constitutionally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
consistent
with
your
position.
