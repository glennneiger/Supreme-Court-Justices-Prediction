justice

mr.
sindel,
isn't
your
position
really...
why,
for
whatever
reason
the
jury
may
have
done
it,
they
did
not
impose
the
death
penalty,
they
imposed
only
a
life
sentence,
and
that
act
operates
as
an
implied
acquittal
of
the
death
sentence?
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
i
gather,
this
would
be
an
extension
of
green,
wouldn't
it,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you?
justice
jr.
would
you
say
that
it's
an
actual
acquittal?
justice
jr.
well,
it
is
possible,
isn't
it,
that
a
jury,
irrespective
of
the
evidence,
irrespective
of
instructions,
for
whatever
reason,
they
decide
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
your
colleague
argues
not
only
the
double
jeopardy
clause
but
due
process,
doesn't
he?
justice
jr.
and
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
jr.
only?
justice
jr.
even
though
the
defendant
wiped
the
slate
clean,
you
couldn't
try
him
again.
that's
right.
justice
jr.
well,
there
you
mandate
a
distinction
between
offense
and
sentencing?
justice
jr.
that's
your
only
answer?
justice
jr.
well,
it
still
isn't
the
case,
i
gather,
mr.
sindel,
that
your
due
process
argument
as
distinguished
from
your
double
jeopardy
argument
is
key
to
the
concept
that
death
is
unique.
justice
jr.
no,
but
is
it
central
to
your
due
process
argument
that
death
is
unique?
