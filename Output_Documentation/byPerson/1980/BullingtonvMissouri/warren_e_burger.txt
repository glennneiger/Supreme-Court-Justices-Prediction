chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
first
this
morning
bullington
v.
missouri.
mr.
sindel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
your
position
was
that
jury
was
a
nullity.
chief
justice
burger
your
position
when
you
asked
for
a
new
trial
was
that
in
effect
the
jury
was
not
a
jury.
chief
justice
burger
so,
then,
it
wasn't
a
jury,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cook.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
anything
further,
mr.
sindel?
chief
justice
burger
suppose,
counsel,
that
you
had
gone
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
that
through
some
mistaken,
inadvertence
one
of
the
12
jurors
that
had
rendered
the
verdict
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
there
was
not
a
duly
constituted
jury.
then
your
claim
would
be
there
was
no
verdict
at
all,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
burger
he
doesn't
rely
very
much
on
the
verdict
finding
him
guilty,
does
he?
chief
justice
burger
well,
you're
using
the
term
acquittal
to
describe
the
failure
to
return
a
death
verdict?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
