justice
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
your
argument
would
require
us
to
directly
overrule
stroud
v.
united
states
and
to
overrule
what
was
said,
at
least,
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
and
other
cases,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
stroud
was
a
decision
directly
on
this
issue,
wasn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
i
won't
take
any
more
of
your
time.
justice
stewart
you
would
have
exactly
the
same
issue
as
you
have
in
this
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stewart
well,
here
it's
the
prosecutor.
justice
stewart
no,
it's
the
prosecutor
who's
filed
these
aggravating
circumstances--
justice
stewart
--and
is
going
to
ask
for
the
death
penalty
again,
wants
to.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
a
pretty
good
answer
because
you
have
authority
to
support
you.
justice
stewart
what
were
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
stewart
not
a
record
of
another
capital
offense?
justice
stewart
and
it's
conceded
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
will
be
filed
will
be
identical
this
time,
and
that
the
evidence
will
be
virtually
identical,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
well,
at
the
first
trial
they
imposed
a
life
sentence
but
then
something
about
a
50
years?
justice
stewart
but
that's
statutory,
that
wasn't
the
jury's
verdict?
