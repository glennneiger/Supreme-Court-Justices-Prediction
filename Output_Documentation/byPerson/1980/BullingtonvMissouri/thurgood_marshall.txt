justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cook,
suppose
the
statute
said
that
you
can
be
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
second
degree
murder,
which
i
assume
you
have
in
missouri.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you're
convicted
of
second
degree
murder,
you're
acquitted
on
first.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
missouri?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
isn't
it
automatically
true
that
if
you
are
found
guilty
of
life
imprisonment
you
are
acquitted
as
to
death?
when
you
boil
it
down,
that's
what
they're
arguing,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
be
the
difference
if
they
said
that
you
can
get
life
for
one
or
100
years
for
the
other,
and
it
was
the
degree
was
used?
it
still
would
be...
you'd
go
with
the
first,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
the
language
really
important
or
what
happens
is
important?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
jury
said,
this
man
shall
not
be
killed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
first
hearings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
but
he
was
again
put
in
jeopardy
as
to
whether
he
should
be
killed
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
correct,
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean,
he
never
lost
jeopardy
when
the
jury
came
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't...
mine
was
just
hypothetical,
was
that
it
had...
it
wasn't
sentencing,
it
was
degree
of
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
missouri
says,
if
you
killed
somebody
with
aggravating
circumstances,
you
are
subject
to
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
and
death.
if
you
are
guilty
of
homicide
without
those
problems,
you
are
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
life.
right?
are
you
with
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
jury
brings
in
a
second
degree
verdict,
life.
can
you
try
him
again
on
first
degree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
difference
is
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
you
realize
that
my
hypothetical
didn't
say
anything
about
limited
to
death.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we're
together
that
far.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
true
in
the
case
i
told
you
where
you
were
acquitted
on
first
degree,
but
convicted
on
second
degree?
you
can't
try
to
rescind
it
on
first
degree,
can
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
i
mean,
it's
the
same
thing
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
wipe
the
slate
clean.
