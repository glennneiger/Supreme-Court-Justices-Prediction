mr.
richard
h.
sindel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
july
of
1978
robert
bullington
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
jury
panel
to
be
commenced
against
him
under
this
court's
decision
in
taylor
v.
louisiana.
it
was
contended
at
that
time
that
the
statutes
constructed
in
jackson
county
violated
those
provisions
in
that
case
in
that
they
excluded
women
unconstitutionally
from
the
jury.
five
months
later
he
proceeded
to
trial
for
his
life,
at
which
time
the
jury
came
back
with
a
verdict
of
guilty,
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial,
and
rendered
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
the
question
now
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
missouri
can
seize
upon
the
opportunity
to
take
the
reversal
of
that
decision
of
guilt
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
duren
v.
missouri
and
resubject
and
resentence
this
individual
to
a
trial
for
his
life.
throughout
the
proceedings
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
the
defendant
persisted
in
claiming
that
to
proceed
to
trial
with
the
jury
panel
so
composed
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
the
trial
court,
following
the
mandates
of
the
missouri
supreme
court,
denied
these
motions.
he
proceeded
to
the
trial.
subsequent
to
the
trial
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
sustained
and
a
new
trial
was
ordered.
the
state
filed
a
notice
of
aggravation
of
circumstances
pursuant
to
missouri
statutory
guidelines.
at
that
time
the
petitioner
filed
a
notice
to
quash
those
aggravating
circumstances,
contending
that
he
was
subject
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
that
any
retrial
or
relitigation
of
an
issue
that
had
already
been
determined
by
a
jury
was
precluded
by
that
clause.
he
also
at
that
time
contended
that
it
would
unnecessarily
and
needlessly
chill
his
rights
to
a
jury
trial,
that
it
would
be...
that
any
sentence
of
death
at
the
second
proceeding
would
be
excessive
and
disproportionate
to
any
sentence,
the
sentence
of
life
at
the
first
proceeding,
and
that
the
statutory
provisions
under
which
the
state
intended
to
proceed
were
vague
and
overbroad
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
think
that
at
that
particular
time
since
there
had
been
no
determination
by
the
jury
of
an
acquittal
or
that
death
was
not
the
appropriate
sentence
in
this
particular
case,
and
a
jury
is
specifically
instructed
in
missouri
as
to
what
they
need
to
find.
they
need
to
find
the
existence
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
that
aggravating
circumstance
is
not
outweighed
by
any
mitigating
circumstances
that
are
presented,
either
statutory
or
non-statutory.
if
at
that
time
the
jury
had
obviously
determined
that
in
fact
an
aggravating
circumstance
did
exist,
then
i
think
the
state
would
not
be
precluded,
because
it
would
not
be
tantamount
or
substantially
equivalent
to
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
in
this
particular
case
the
state
had
one
full
fair
opportunity
to
present
to
the
jury
their
version
and
why
this
defendant
should
suffer
with
his
life.
and
at
this,
they
presented
all
the
evidence
they
wanted
to,
they
presented
all
the
evidence
that
they
had.
in
fact,
they
have
conceded
that
they
have
no
additional
evidence.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
yes,
i
would.
i
think
that
the
verdict
of
acquittal...
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
can
seize
upon
the
opportunity
because
of
the
trial
court's
necessary
action
considering
the
missouri
supreme
court's
refusal
to
recognize
the
decision
in
taylor,
the
trial
court's
necessary
action
in
putting
this
defendant
to
a
trial,
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
seize
upon
that
opportunity
to
muster
additional
evidence.
but
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
it
makes
any
difference
whether
or
not
there
is
additional
evidence
or
there
is
not,
to
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
defendant
was
placed
in
jeopardy,
whether
or
not
he
went
through
the
ordeal,
the
anguish
of
a
trial
and
whether
or
not
he
should
be
subjected
to
that
same
ordeal,
that
same
anguish,
a
second
time
when
a
jury,
unobjected
to
by
the
state,
a
jury
composed,
in
their
opinion,
i
assume,
properly,
can
then
render
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
there's
no
question
in
missouri
that
the
sentencing
phase
is
functionally
equivalent
to
a
trial.
there
is
no
difference
in
a
trial
in
the
functioning
phase
except
for
the
evidence
that
may
be
introduced.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
believe
that's...
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
would.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
instruction
does
not
have
anything
concerning
leniency.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
and
i
believe
that
that
instruction
is
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
lockett,
wherein
they
say
that
there
has
to
be
allowance
of
a
broad
scope
to
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
i
think
that
that
instruction
does
cover
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances.
as
i
read
that
instruction,
and
as
it
is
given
to
the
jury,
it
allows
them
to
determine
from
all
the
facts
in
the
case,
not
those
specific
facts
of
aggravating
circumstances
or
mitigating
circumstances
but
all
the
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
and
i
think
that
under
that
instruction,
if
they
were
in
fact
to
return
a
verdict,
special
or
otherwise...
in
other
words,
if
they
returned
a
verdict
saying,
we
just
didn't
find
any
aggravating
circumstances,
i
think
that
obviously
that
would
be
without
question
an
acquittal.
if
they
returned
a
verdict
and
they
said,
the
mitigating
circumstances
as
submitted
were
such
that
we
determined
that
they
outweighed
the
aggravating
circumstances,
again
that
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
acquittal.
if
they
find--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
yes,
i
believe
it
would
be.
although,
in
green
they
talked
of
an
implied
acquittal,
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
implied
in
this
acquittal.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
it's
an
express
acquittal.
they
had
that
choice
and
they
came
back
with
it.
and
they
came
back
and
they
said,
we
find
that
the
state
has
failed
to
prove
their
case.
so
that
in
terms
of
distinguishing
on
that
grounds,
i
think
that
it
has
more
strength,
even.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
jury
has
complete
power
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
they
have
the
complete
power
to
render
any
decisions
that
they
wish
and
that
cannot
be
attacked.
it
cannot
be
dissected.
it
cannot
be
circumscribed
in
such
a
way
as
to
try
and
glean
or
pull
from
that
decision
why
it
came
about.
in
this
particular
situation
it's
obvious
that
no
matter
where
the
determination
came
from
it
came
down,
and
they
said,
death
is
not
the
appropriate
punishment,
life
is
appropriate
in
this
particular
case,
with
this
particular
defendant.
and
in
the
same
way,
by
examining
these
factors
and
by
determining
that
life
in
fact
is
the
appropriate
sentence,
any
other
sentence
under
this
court's
decision
wouldn't
necessarily
be
excessive
and
disproportionate;
another
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
there
is
no
special
interrogatory
or
special
verdict
form
that's
allowed
in
the
state
of
missouri.
however,
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
if
a
jury
comes
back
with
a
life
imprisonment
sentence,
that
they
must
have
found
that
death
was
in
fact
inappropriate.
there
is
very
little
that
they
could
have
otherwise
found.
the
jury
was
death-qualified
pursuant
to
witherspoon,
so
there's
obviously
no
people
that
are
sitting
on
the
jury
that
are
so
constituted
that
they
could
not
impose
the
death
penalty.
these
are
individuals
who
indicated
under
questioning
that
they
could
in
fact
impose
the
death
penalty
in
the
proper
case
under
the
proper
circumstances.
the
only
thing
that
can
be
concluded
is
that
in
fact
this
was
not
the
proper
case
or
the
proper
circumstances.
now,
we
would
also
contend
that
any
sentence
other
than
the
sentence
of
life
would
have
to
be
excessive
and
disproportionate
under
the
court's
earlier
decisions.
there's
no
question
that
the
jury
had
the
opportunity
to
weigh
this
particular
defendant
and
in
the
vital
interest
of
the
community
and
the
vital
interest
of
the
defendant,
they
determined
that
the
only
appropriate
sentence
was
life.
so
under
those
circumstances
a
retrial
and
allowing
another
jury
to
determine
if
the
first
jury
was
correct,
and
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
dealt
with
this
by
saying,
we
can't
say
whether
or
not
the
jury
below
was
a
maverick
jury.
you
don't
really
know.
but
if
you
allow,
if
you
allow
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
to
say
that,
then
every
time
a
life
sentence
comes
down,
they
can
say,
that
could
have
been
the
result
of
a
maverick
jury,
and
then
the
comparison
test
that
is
so
vital
to
this
court's
decisions
in
the
holding
that
georgia's
statutes
in
gregg,
where
they'd
said
that
this
appellate
review
is
one
of
the
vital
elements
that's
necessary
under
the
eighth
amendment
to
insure
and
to
guarantee
both
to
the
community
and
to
the
defendant
that
his
rights
under
that
amendment
will
be
respected,
will
be
lost.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
in
terms
of
the
double
jeopardy
argument
and
in
terms
of
every
argument
throughout
this
case
that
it
is
a
death
penalty
case,
and
there's
no
question
as
to
how
unique
it
is.
this
is
why
perhaps
stroud
and
pearce
and
chaffin
need
to
be
reconsidered.
they
did
not
provide
in
those
cases
for
the
strict
statutory
guidelines
for
the
sentence's
discretion.
these
guidelines
are
to
focus
the
sentence
on
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
assure
ourselves,
assure
society,
and
assure
the
defendant
that
he
is
getting
the
benefit
of
all
the
constitutional
rights,
because
it
is
a
unique
penalty.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
think
that
there's
no
question
under
the
chaffin
decision
that
that
would
be
proper.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
there's
two
distinguishing
characteristics.
first,
this
court
recognized
in
distinguishing...
in
the
gardner
case
they
distinguished
williams
v.
new
york,
a
death
penalty
case,
and
they
say,
well,
we
think
that
due
process
requires
that
there
be
an
adversarial
proceeding
and
that
the
lawyer
be
disclosed
the
contents
of
a
presentence
investigation.
now,
there
was
no
overruling
of
the
williams
case
because
in
u.s.
v.
grayson
that
case
was
again
upheld,
and
they
said,
the
court
can
determine
from
the
defendant's
testimony
if
they
believe
that
he
was
committing
perjury,
and
they
can
use
that,
in
fact,
in
sentencing.
so
there's
no
question
that
you
do
not
have
to
overrule.
but
it
is
perhaps
necessary
to
reconsider
the
decisions
in
those
cases
for
two
reasons.
one,
those
cases
took
place
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
gregg,
recognizing
how
unique
and
irrevocable
and
final
the
sentence
of
death
is,
and
two,
the
idea
that
the
sentencing
phase
of
this
trial
is
exactly
like
a
trial.
there
are
opening
statements.
there
is
the
introduction
of
evidence,
and
the
taking
of
testimony.
there
are
instructions
to
the
jury,
there
are
arguments
of
counsel,
there
is
then
deliberation
by
that
jury,
and
a
verdict.
this
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
acquittal.
if
it
walks,
talks,
and
looks
like
a
duck,
it's
a
duck.
there
can
be
no
question
that
this
defendant
had
to
undergo
the
ordeals
and
the
anxiety
and
the
pressures
that
exist
at
trial.
now,
this
court
in
breed
recognized
the
existence
of
those
pressures
and
that
ordeal
in
a
juvenile
court
case
and
they
said,
well,
then,
it
doesn't
have
perhaps
as
many
pressures
as
a
situation
where
you're
on
trial
in
a
felony
case,
but
it's
still
enough,
and
we
recognize
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
protected
for
having
to
undergo
those
ordeals
again.
there
can
be
no
question,
the
magnitude
of
the
ordeal
when
you
are
being
tried
for
your
life,
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
this
needs
to
be
protected,
that
the
defendant
needs
to
have
the
protection
from
this
court
of
having
to
undergo
that
experience
again,
and
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
guarantees
it
to
him.
in
this
court's
decision
in
di
francesco
there
was
remarks
concerning
the
finality
of
judgments,
and
we
are
here
talking
about
the
finality
of
judgments,
for
that
jury
did
render
a
final
decision,
a
final
verdict,
and
the
state
had
their
opportunity
to
make
their
case
for
death.
and
the
defendant
in
that
case,
unlike
the
defendant
in
di
francesco,
had
a
right
and
was
entitled
to
expect
the
finality
and
the
repose
that
is
guaranteed
to
him
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
unless
he
is
accorded
that,
there
is
no
question
that
the
state
can
seize
upon
the
opportunity
again
and
again
and
again.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
there
was
one
verdict
that
jury--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--absolutely,
because
there
is
no
question
that
that
jury
was
empowered
to
acquit.
if
that
jury--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--excuse
me?
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
our
position
was
that
the
jury
was
unconstitutionally
composed.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
would
there
be
any
question
in
this
court
if
we
had
filed
our
motion,
in
that
case,
if
they
had
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
of
murder,
and
perhaps
guilty
of
one
of
the
other
offenses,
that
he
could
then
be
retried
because
we
were
able
to
obtain
a
reversal
on
that
conviction?
i
think
that
green
talks
specifically
in
terms
of
that
kind
of
forfeiture.
this
is
not
a
question
of
a
waiver
of
rights,
this
is
a
question,
then,
does
he
forfeit
the
protections
guaranteed
to
him
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
and
green
talks
specifically
in
terms
of
forfeiture,
and
that
he
is
not
to
lose
his
right
to
a
constitutionally
composed
jury
in
exchange
for
a
valid
plea
of
formal
acquittal.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
in
this
case
that
that
jury
was
constitutionally
composed
only
to
render
a
verdict
of
acquittal
but
they
could
unquestionably
render
that
verdict.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
certainly
hope
for
a
more
sympathetic
jury.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that's
correct.
i
would...
i
obviously
have
no
idea
what
the
jury's
going
to
be
like
the
second
time
around.
i
obviously
hope
that
it's
a
sympathetic
jury.
i
obviously
hope
that
it's
a
constitutionally
composed
jury.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
i
would
like
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
but
then
there
is
no
constitutional
provision
that
forbids
that
second
bite
to
me,
but
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
provision
that
forbids
that
bite
to
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
would
be
any
cleaner.
i
think
that
it
would
be
identical.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
yes,
sir.
absolutely.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
i...
well,
my
understanding
is
that
if
there
was
an
acquittal
of
any
offense.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
set
aside
a
verdict
of
conviction.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
recognize
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
and
that
is
a
distinct
difference.
in
scott
they
did
not
talk
in
terms
of
whether...
they
did
talk
in
terms
but
found
that
that
was
not
an
acquittal.
but
in
this
particular
case
it
has
no
other
coloring.
it
is
an
acquittal.
there
is
no
question
that
the
jury
was
there
and
could
acquit,
that
they
had
the
evidence
in
front
of
them;
the
state
has
in
the
beginning
conceded
that
there
is
no
additional
evidence.
so
it's
obvious
that
whatever
evidence
they're
going
to
present
at
the
second
trial,
it's
identical
to
the
evidence
that
they
presented
at
the
first
trial,
and
there
is
no
reason
that
the
defendant
should
have
to
undergo
that
ordeal.
in
fact,
there's
specific
reason
in
the
constitution
why
he
shouldn't
have
to
undergo
that
ordeal.
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
prosecution
should
have
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
when
what
we
have
is
an
acquittal.
we
do
not
have
the...
setting
aside
the
conviction
because
of
preindictment
delay,
or
because
of
motions
to
suppress,
or
other
motions
that
do
not
go
to
the
determination
of
factual
elements
of
the
offense.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
i
asked
for
the
second
play,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
by
asking
for
the
second
trial
i
waive
my
rights
to
protection
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
one
part
of
the
argument.
there
is
no
question
that
because
death
is
different,
this
case
has
the
two
elements.
one
is
the
death,
and
one
is
the
procedures
and
the
specific
statutory
guidelines
that
had
been
set
up.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
the
authorities
have
never
dealt
with
the
situation
in
what's
been
a
bifurcated
trial.
the
jury
is
given
specific
guidelines,
given
instructions,
submitted
evidence
to
them,
and
then
asked
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
evidence
is
sufficient
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
establish
the
elements
of
the
state's
case.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
that
cannot
be
ignored.
i
think
also
the
fact
that
this
is
a
death
case
makes
it
unique,
perhaps
the
bifurcation.
the
state
argues
that
it
is
the
bifurcation
that
we
say
is
the
unique
part,
but
it's
not
really
that.
the
bifurcation
serves
the
purpose
both
of
the
state
and
of
the
defendant.
it
precludes
the
defendant
from
having
to
be
subject
to
evidence
that
would
not
be
relevant
to
his
guilt,
but
it
also
allows
a
state
the
opportunity
to
present
that
evidence
in
an
effort
to
persuade
a
jury
that
in
fact
they
should
return
a
verdict
of
guilt.
in
fact,
under
the
statutory
provisions
in
missouri,
the
one
in
which
it
says
it's
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible,
or
inhuman,
i
assume
that
at
that
they
could
present
inflammatory
photographs
that
would
not
be
relevant
to
guilt
or
innocence
and
would
be
precluded
from
the
trial.
under
this
particular
circumstance
they
certainly
could
not
come
back
into
court
after
the
jury
had
rendered
a
verdict
of
life
imprisonment
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
i
have
some
new
photographs,
and
these
photographs
absolutely
will
convince
that
jury
they
should
return
a
verdict
of
death.
can
i
have
another
opportunity
at
it?
it's
precluded
from
that.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
don't
believe
it's
a
question
of
belief
or
not
belief
in
this
particular
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
prosecution
is
allowed
the
opportunity
to
again
present
their
case
to
either
strengthen
it
or
to
present
the
same
case.
he
could
not
come
back
in
and
say,
after
a
verdict
of
acquittal
at
a
guilt
phase,
i'm
sorry,
the
police
officer
just
told
me
that
he
got
a
confession
from
this
man.
can
i
come
back
in
and
resubmit
the
case
to
you?
and
some
juror
says,
well,
if
i
heard
that,
i
would
have
convicted;
you
can't
reimpanel
that
juror,
once
they
have
come
back
with
acquittal.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
absolutely
not.
i
believe
he
can
be
retried.
in
fact,
i
think
that
justice
harlan
in
the
tateo
decision
specifically
points,
and
i
think
that
is
the
point
that
perhaps
the
double
jeopardy
clause
hinges
on.
there
has
been
the
talk
of
the
continuing
waiver
theory
and
whether
or
not
he
waives
his
right
to
the
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
but
harlan
talks,
justice
harlan
talks
in
terms
of
the
balancing
of
society's
interests
as
against
the
defendants'
interest,
and
in
this
particular
case
society's
interest
has
been
vindicated,
it
has
been
properly
represented
as
well
as
the
defendants'.
and
at
that
time
society
through
this
jury
spoke
and
they
spoke
and
said,
this
man
does
not
deserve
to
die.
i
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
it
only
required
that
they
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
gregg
v.
georgia,
recognizing--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--it
was
a
decision
in
which
the
jury
was
not
presented
with
evidence
as
to
why,
in
fact,
a
verdict
or
a
particular
sentence
was
proper.
and
it
did
not
involve
this
either-or
decision
similar
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
decision
in
a
trial,
at
the
particular
trial
phase,
at
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
stroud
does
not,
and
i
believe
that
the
gregg
decision
requires
that
stroud
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
that.
stroud,
individually,
at
that
time,
did
not
have
the
entitlement
to
finality
that
this
petitioner
deserves.
and
i
think
that
it's
only
a
reconsideration
of
stroud
rather
than
an
overruling
of
the
general
principle
there.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
well,
your
honor,
i
still
believe
under
those
circumstances,
especially
under
the
circumstances
where
the
state
themselves
had
not
complained
about
the
composure
of
the
jury,
that
the
defendant
after
undergoing
the
ordeal
of
trial
has
a
right
to
rely
on
that
verdict
if
it
is
in
fact
an
acquittal.
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
jury
is
properly
composed,
if
it
goes
to
trial--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--he
relies
on
the
verdict
of
acquittal.
he
does
not
rely
on
the
verdict
of
guilty,
because
he
needn't
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
is
functionally
equivalent
to
acquittal.
i
wish
if
i
may
respond
to
several
points
that
were
made
by
my
brother.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
stroud
was
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
gregg
recognizing
how
unique
the
death
penalty
was
and
did
not
have
the
same
equivalency
to
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
that
is
one
part
of
it,
and
that
the
procedure
used
to
obtain
the
sentence
of
death
is
different
as
well.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
di
francesco
needs
to
be
overruled
and
this
court
needn't
concern
itself
with
overruling
the
di
francesco
case.
in
fact,
in
oral
arguments
in
that
case,
mr.
frey
who
so
ably
represented
the
u.s.
government
indicated
that
this
was
a
question
of
legal
air.
we're
not
talking
here
about
whether
or
not
there's
legal
air.
he
also
indicated
that
under
certain
circumstances...
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
questions...
under
certain
circumstances,
especially
the
death
penalty,
there
are
certain
probative
problems
of
procedural
fairness
that
would
have
to
be
considered.
so
obviously
di
francesco
does
not
apply
to
this
particular
case.
di
francesco
did
not
have
the
adversarial
proceeding
that
is
contained
and
is
mandated
by
gardner
v.
florida.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i'd
like
to
correct
that
point.
if
you
read
the
brief...
well,
excuse
me...
but
if
the
state
would
have
properly
read
the
brief,
he'll
see
that
nowhere
do
i
raise
the
point
that
any
sentence
of
death
would
be
vindictive.
that
is
not
the
point
that
we
raise.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
i
believe
so.
i
think
beck
v.
alabama
specifically
says
that.
they
say
that
because
death
is
unique,
there
is
a
higher
requirement,
and
that
beck
v.
alabama
recognizes,
although
no
other
case
recognizes,
that
lesser
included
offenses
in
a
death
case
must
be
submitted,
and
that
is
because
of
the
necessity
for
that
higher
requirement
of
due
process.
i
also
believe
that
in
applying
death,
it
says
that
to
apply
the
death
penalty
in
the
beck
case,
there
must
be
this
elevated
procedure
that
is
followed,
and
there's
no
question
that
it
has
to
be
followed
under
the
eighth
amendment
prescriptions.
i
think
that
in
di
francesco
the
argument
that
was
presented
is
consistent
somewhat
with
professor
westen's
argument
in
his
article
that's
quoted
there,
"the
triptych
of
double
jeopardy",
the
idea
that
there
are
three
things
that
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
protect,
the
finality
of
jury
verdicts
of
acquittal,
the
lawful
administration
of
sentence,
and
third,
the
expectation
of
finality
or
repose
that
exists
in
the
defendant
after
he
has
undergone
the
ordeal
of
trial.
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
use
the
wayne
technique
that
professor
westen
suggests,
and
also
we
cite
to
a
new
article
that
he
has
written
in
our
supplemental
brief,
distinguishing
di
francesco,
in
which
he
talked
specifically
about
this
case,
that
argument
would
hold
water,
and
that
di
francesco
needn't
be
distinguished
as
well
as
stroud
and
pearce
needn't
be
overruled
to
sustain
a
decision
in
this
particular
case
that
mr.
bullington
need
not
undergo
the
ordeal
of
a
trial
again.
the
prosecutor
has
indicated--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--that's
correct.
the
prosecutor
has
indicated
that
at
the
second
phase
of
the
trial
he
looks
to
go
into
perhaps
the
facts
surrounding
the
alleged
serious
assaultive
convictions.
these
are
13-year-old
convictions
that
the
defendant
had
prior
to
this
trial.
i
think
that
this
is
somewhat
indicative
of
the
problems--
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
of
capital
murder;
right.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
but
if
there
were
a
mandatory
sentence...
yes,
that's
right...
if
there
are
mandatory
sentences,
it
would
be
the
same
result.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
the
provision
under
the
statute
is
that
he
is
to
be
sentenced
to
life
without
provision
for
probation
and
parole
for
a
period
of
50
years.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
in
essence
he's
buried.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
if
i
win
here
there,
will
be
no
need.
if
i
win
there
there
will
be
no
need
either.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
if
he
were
to
be
found
guilty
of
capital
murder,
then
there
would
be
only
one
available
sentence.
mr.
richard
h.
sindel
there
would
be
no
need
to
because
there
would
be
only
the
one
available
sentence.
