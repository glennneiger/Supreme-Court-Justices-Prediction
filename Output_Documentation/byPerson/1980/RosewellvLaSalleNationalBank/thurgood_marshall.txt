mr.
hauser,
it's
a
little
late
in
the
argument,
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
under
1983?
justice
marshall
well,
what
case
is
there
that
fits
in
to
say
that
you
do
have
a
remedy
in
the
state
courts
of
illinois
under
1983?
what
case
do
you
have
that
says
that?
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say,
willingness;
i
said,
that
says
it
can
be
done.
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
that
what
the
statute
requires?
justice
marshall
well,
i
think
the
statute
requires
either
a
case
or
a
statute
which
says
that
the
courts
of
illinois
are
open
for
this
point,
1983.
and
you
don't
have
either.
justice
marshall
i
know
a
lot
of
other
things
they've
never
denied.
they've
never
denied
an
admiralty
case
either,
have
they?
justice
marshall
and
you
didn't
do
it
because
you
knew
you
couldn't
make
them
pay
it.
