justice
white
but
only
predicated
on
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
what's
the
calendar
like
in
the
federal
court
for
cook
county?
justice
white
well,
is
it
slower
than...
is
it
as
slow
as
the
state
court?
justice
white
well,
now,
what's
the
interval
from
the
filing
of
the
complaint
to
trial
in
the
federal
court?
justice
white
it's
probably
pretty
long,
isn't
it?
justice
white
isn't
the
real
question,
how
soon
should
she
get
a
hearing?
and
you're
arguing...
you
certainly
are
arguing
the
merits
of
her
case
but
isn't
the
question
whether
she
should
be
able
to
get
an
earlier
hearing
in
a
federal
court
than
she
could
in
the
state?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
is
it
true
that
in
her
administrative
remedy,
is
the
remedy
provided
by
the
illinois
tax
statutes
and
refund
statutes,
there
is
no
interest
allowable
in
those,
is
there?
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
all
right.
so
you
rely
on
the
availability
of
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
courts
on
1983?
justice
white
don't
you
really...
just
like
in
this
case,
the
question
of
the
power
to
issue
the
injunction,
was
reached
before
decisions
on
whether
the
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action.
justice
white
which
is
rather
normal,
isn't
it?
justice
white
but
it's
an
availability
under
federal
law.
you're
in
a
state
court
but
you're
appealing
the
federal
law.
and
do
you
have
any
authority
that
1341
should
be
construed
to
include
remedies
in
state
courts
under
federal
law
as
well
as
under
state
law?
justice
white
after
all,
it
will
be
federal
law,
won't
it?
justice
white
well,
will
it
or
not?
justice
white
if
it's
under
1983
it
is
a
federal
statute,
it
will
be
federal
law.
justice
white
well,
that
the
action
substantively
will
proceed
under
federal
law?
justice
white
oh,
i
don't
know.
it's
a
question
of
construction
of
1341.
justice
white
a
remedy
in
the
state
courts.
does
it
mean
under
federal
law
as
well
as
under
state
law?
justice
white
i
know
what
your
answer
is,
but...
your
answer
is,
yes.
justice
white
you're...
the
lack
of
provision
for
interest
is
simply
the
reason
why
the
remedy
is
inadequate?
justice
white
and
the
merits
of
your
constitutional
claim
are
not
here
at
all,
are
they?
justice
white
well,
this
is
still
a
question
of
the
construction
of
1341,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
so
you
will
argue
that
that
is
not
a
plain,
speedy,
and
adequate
remedy,
or
whatever
the
words
are.
justice
white
i
suppose
one
relevant
question
is,
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
what
an
inadequate
remedy
might
be.
wasn't
it,
historically,
the
notion
that
interest
isn't
allowable
against
the
government,
absent
some
specific
statute?
justice
white
well,
is
there
any...
have
you
got
any
evidence
at
all,
any
legislative
history
or
any
other
indications
that
congress
thought
the
unavailability
of
interest
was
tantamount
to
the
lack
of
a
speedy
and
adequate
remedy?
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
if
you
paid
the
tax
and
sued
for
a
refund
and
it
was...
in
the
state
courts?
justice
white
or
do
you
do
it
administratively?
you
do
file
it
in
a
state
court?
justice
white
and
in
that
case
you
could
present
your
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
white
yes,
well,
all
right,
but
now,
if
you
won
on
your
constitutional
argument,
your
colleague
suggested
that
the
state
would
pay
interest.
justice
white
i
know,
but
i
thought
the
state
had
said
only
that
without
adjudicating
the
constitutional
point.
suppose
the
state
courts
had
themselves
decided
that
the
assessment
was
unconstitutional,
and
that
you
deserved
a
refund.
have
the
state
courts
then
said
there
would
be
no
interest
payable?
justice
white
whether
or
not
the
assessment
is
constitutional?
justice
white
well,
didn't
you
understand
the
state
to
argue
to
the
contrary
or
not?
did
i
miss
any...
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
colleague,
here
for
the
state?
justice
white
if
you
win...
if
you're
allowed
to
maintain
your
action
in
the
federal
court
and
you
get
an
injunction,
you
win
on
your
equal
protection
ground;
you
wouldn't
expect
to
get
interest?
justice
white
you're
asking
for
the
injunction,
and
even
if
you
ask
for
damages
you
wouldn't
get
interest
as
damages.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
yes.
