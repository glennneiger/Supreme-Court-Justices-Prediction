mr.
james
l.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
it
has
been
remarked,
there
is
one
basic
question
before
the
court
today.
that
is,
is
there
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
at
hand,
available
without
doubt...
cromwell...
in
the
courts
of
illinois?
counsel
has
maintained
in
his
petition
for
cert
that,
one,
the
present
statutory
remedy
which
returns
a
taxpayer's
money
as
alleged
and
procedurally
admitted,
after
about
two
years
without
interest,
is
adequate;
it
is
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient,
and
he
merely
reiterates
the
holdings,
not
the
dicta
but
the
holdings
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
lakefront,
reiterated
in
the
clarendon
decision,
and
in
a
host
of
other
decisions
in
illinois.
the
illinois
court
has
unequivocally
determined
that
the
nonpayment
of
interest
does
not
render
a
remedy
inadequate.
mr.
james
l.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
ps&e>
["],
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient.
i
believe
if
we
go
back
into
cases
like
great
lakes
and
into
matthews
v.
rodgers
and
the
extensions
of
those,
"plain,
speedy,
and
efficient.
"
has
been
declared
coterminous
with
or
the
same,
has
the
same
meaning
as
"adequate".
mr.
james
l.
fox
sir,
in
the
context
of
the
united
states,
first
of
all,
we
do
have
the
question
of
the
sovereign.
and
interest
allowable
against
the
sovereign
is
by
statute,
as
witness
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
james
l.
fox
we
are
not
claiming,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
illinois
is
compelled
to
award
interest.
that
question
is
not
specifically
within
this
case.
i
refer,
for
instance,
to
judge
haynsworth's
remarks
in
the
livingston
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
wherein
he
said
south
carolina
may
elect
to
pay
interest
or
not.
it
is
a
sovereign
and
it
doesn't
have
to
award
interest
on
tax
refunds.
but
if
it
does
not,
it
then
opens
its
door
to
federal
jurisdiction
by
not
providing
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy.
in
the
7th
circuit
we
had
the
same
thing
in
olin
mathieson.
mr.
james
l.
fox
no,
sir,
because
we
do
not
sue
for
a
refund...
1341
is
directed
only
to
injunctive
relief
and
this
case
stands
on
that
particular
proposition
which
we
have
alleged.
we
seek
injunctive
relief
and
we
maintain
that
injunctive
relief
is
the
only
relief
which
will
maintain
this
taxpayer
whole.
we
maintain
that
if
we're
going
to
keep
it--
one,
we
have
an
admitted,
we
believe,
constitutional
deprivation
of--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--no,
sir.
the
constitutional
deprivation
is
the
inequitable
tax
assessment
we're
under,
under
a
system--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--an
equal
protection
and
due
process,
no
matter
how
you
call
it.
it's
due
process
in
this
respect,
that
a
lien
for
taxes
affixes
against
a
person's
property
on
the
first
day
of
january
in
any
particular
tax
year,
and
therefore
amounts
to
a
taking,
as
it
were,
of
the
taxpayer's
property
without
due
process
of
law,
and
it
of
course
subsumes
the
equal
protection--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--the
remedy
is
inadequate.
as
i
said
before--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--i
think
they
are
procedurally
admitted.
mr.
james
l.
fox
exactly.
mr.
james
l.
fox
that
is
correct.
at
least
not
in
the
petition
for
cert.
this
matter,
by
the
way,
came
on
below
on
a
petition
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
which
was
denied
and
the
case
dismissed
under
the
grounds
which
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
by
the
district
judge.
the
elementary
question
is
not
really...
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
that...
not
whether
or
not
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
interest.
we
are
not
litigating
that
particular
question
today.
mr.
james
l.
fox
because,
i
believe
that
to
take
a
man's
money
today...
to
paraphrase
judge
learned
hand
about
50
years
ago
in
the
procter
&
gamble
case,
to
take
a
man's
money
today
as
a
condition
of
his
going
into
court
and
being
able
to
sue
for
a
refund
and
then
two
or
more
years
later
giving
back
that
same
money,
is
giving
back
less
than
the
state
took.
mr.
james
l.
fox
yes,
sir.
now,
it
would
be
a
second
story
if
we
were
to
go
into
the
condition
which
obtains
in
the
financial
world
today...
and
it
is
not
without
some
degree
of
irony
that
the
day
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
the
prime
rate
was
set
at
19
percent,
which
is
not
available
to
the
average
taxpayer,
of
course,
at
prime.
now,
is
it...
and
this
is
a
second
question,
or
a
sequel.
does
it
deny
due
process
to
the
citizenry
of
illinois
merely
to
have
a
remedy
which
merely
after
an
hiatus
of
two
or
more
years
gives
back
far
less
than
the
state
took,
meanwhile
allowing
the
state
to
use
that
taxpayer's
money
to
generate
interest
for
the
state
which
the
county
treasurer
is
allowed
to
do?
mr.
james
l.
fox
yes,
sir.
it
is
not
in
this
case
and
i
don't
mean
to
go
far
afield.
mr.
james
l.
fox
i
apologize--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--because
one
of
the
justices
had
asked
me--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--i
see.
mr.
james
l.
fox
it
is.
mr.
james
l.
fox
but
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
we
allege,
and
it
is
admitted,
there
was
an
unconstitutional
taking,
we
believe
that
a
remedy
which
does
not
give
back
everything
that
is
taken,
making
the
party
whole,
is
itself
constitutionally
infirm.
mr.
james
l.
fox
it
is
not.
mr.
james
l.
fox
why?
because
let's
merely
assume
a
12
percent
inflation
rate
and
give
it
back
in
two
years,
you're
giving
back
75
cents
for
the
dollar
you
took.
mr.
james
l.
fox
because
of
inflation.
that's
one
aspect,
one
prong.
the
other
prong
is
this,
as
judge
learned
hand
says,
that
a
dollar
a
year
from
now
is
not
worth
a
dollar
today.
and
if
they
take
a
dollar
today,
even
absent
inflation,
and
give
it
back
a
year
from
now
without
interest,
they
have
not
given
me
my
dollar
back.
mr.
james
l.
fox
that's
right.
i
grant
you,
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--that's
what
this
appeal
is
all
about.
mr.
james
l.
fox
that
is
correct.
there
is
a...
if
you
go
down
and
make
a
tally
of
the
states,
some
do,
some
don't.
many
of
the
states
which
don't
allow
interest
allow
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief.
in
fact,
even
in
illinois,
sir,
in
the--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--no,
sir,
the
legislative
history
of
1341
which
i
have
been
able
to
read
is
not
indicative
of
that
particular
point.
it
merely
recites
the
problem
of
out-of-state
corporations
coming
in
and
interrupting
the
tax
collection
procedures.
mr.
james
l.
fox
nor
is
it
plain.
mr.
james
l.
fox
i
think
the
7th
circuit
views
that...
i
think
the
7th
circuit,
mr.
chief
justice,
used
the
term
"plain"
in
its
decision.
mr.
james
l.
fox
i
believe
so;
yes.
i
think
they
are
subsumed,
that
speedy
is
subsumed
under
the
word
adequate,
which
seems
to
be
more
generic.
mr.
james
l.
fox
on
the
other
hand...
i
would
not
say
that
either,
sir,
quite;
because
if
we're
looking
at
a
basic
constitutional
deprivation
to
begin
with,
somehow
or
other
that...
for
instance:
let
us
suppose
that
this
constitutional
deprivation
of
high
taxes
or
high
assessments
were
motivated
by
ethnic
or
religious
or
racial
considerations
on
the
part
of
the
assessor
of
cook
county,
is
it
proper
relief,
is
it
adequate
relief
to
say,
oh,
go
ahead,
mr.
polish,
or
mr.
irish,
or
mr.
italian
taxpayer,
in
this
particular
neighborhood,
pay
your
taxes
in
full
under
protest,
sue
for
refund,
and
then
in
60
days
you
can
get
your
money
back?
mr.
james
l.
fox
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
fact
that
this
insult
occurs
as
a
result
of
a
constitutional
deprivation
removes
so-called
irreparable
injury,
removes
this
period
of
time,
pure
time.
for
instance...
and
i
would
refer,
let's
say,
to
the
case
of
henry
v.
greenville
airport,
which
was
cited
in
our
brief,
which
states
that
when
a
constitutional
right
is
invaded
like
this,
that
questions
of
irreparable
injury
and
the
like
are
not
even
properly
considered.
mr.
james
l.
fox
that
is
right.
and
again,
however,
we
are
in
a
theoretical
area
when
we
say,
if
the
next
day
you
could
get
your
money
back...
which
is
absolutely
impossible
under
the
cook
county
collection
procedures,
because
you
pay
your
taxes
over
a
period
of
six
months
and
are
not
able
to
sue
until
about
nine
months
after
the
taxes
have
been
paid
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
l.
fox
i
think...
may
i
answer
this
in
another
way?
i
think
that
there
is...
personally,
that
injunctive
relief
should
lie
at
either
the
state
level
to
provide
an
adequate
remedy,
immediate
injunction
at
the
state
level
to
provide
an
adequate
remedy,
or
some
other
remedy
than
requiring
a
taxpayer,
as
here,
to
pay
3-1/2
times
the
just
taxes
merely
to
have
the
right
to
go
in
to
sue
to
have
them
come
back.
mr.
james
l.
fox
that's
right.
my
own
personal
opinion,
however,
i
think
that
if
illinois
paid
reasonable
interest
on
tax
refunds,
commensurate
with
the
market
today,
i
do
not
think
that
we
would
be
before
this
court
today.
mr.
james
l.
fox
we
couldn't
make
it,
we
couldn't
make
it.
i
have
to
cite...
we
have
been
told
that
there
is
a
possibility
out
there
of
a
1983
action,
but
we
have
three
cases
in
illinois
in
which
the
issue
has
been
presented
to
the
illinois
court...
and
the
illinois
court
has...
with
these
federal
equal
protection
due
process
claims,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
came
back
and
said,
you
can
test
those
claims
by
paying
your
taxes
in
full
and
suing
out
a
refund,
and
you
can
get
an
answer
to
your
constitutional
claims.
it
did
that
in
the
case
of
la
salle
national
v.
the
county
of
cook
in
the
57
illinois
2d,
which
we
have
cited.
it
did
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
fulton
market
cold
storage
company
at
the
appellate
level
and
then
at
the
supreme
court
level,
again
a
case
cited
in
our
brief.
and
as
recently
as
this
last
year
in
chrysler
corporation
v.
gunderson,
the
illinois
court,
the
appellate
court,
aware
of
the
decision
of
the
7th
circuit
in
this
case,
said,
furthermore,
our
own
state
supreme
court's
clear
rulings
in
lakefront
and
lorenz,
and
clarendon,
stating
that
the
remedy
is
adequate
without
interest,
remain
controlling
precedent
on
us,
as
on
all
illinois
courts,
unless
reversed
by
that
court
or
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
james
l.
fox
sir?
mr.
james
l.
fox
it's
in
the
response
to
the
petition,
sir.
mr.
james
l.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
the
genesis
of
that
act
was
the
problem
encountered
under
1332
jurisdiction,
where
foreign
corporations
were
coming
into
the
several
states
and
enjoining
state
tax
collections.
that's
in
senator
bone's
remarks
in
the
legislative
history.
i
think
there
are...
at
least
through
that
entire
discussion.
it
is
not
a
protection,
really,
as/or
against
citizens
of
the
state
itself
bringing
actions.
mr.
james
l.
fox
no,
it
does
not.
but
the
genesis
which
you
referred
to
is
found
in
the
problems
of
big
interstate
companies
coming
in,
using
diversity
where
people
couldn't
do
it
locally,
and
if
you
recall
at
that
time,
they
couldn't
use
1343
because
this
was
all
pre-household
v.
lynch.
mr.
james
l.
fox
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
l.
fox
in
a
state
court
it's
the
statutory
procedure.
mr.
james
l.
fox
yes.
and
the
court
said
that,
and
la
salle
testified--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--no,
sir,
because
the
state
has
unequivocally
stated
in
all--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--yes.
there
is
no
interest
payable,
because
the
illinois
law
is,
no
interest
without
a
statute
providing
for
interest,
and
there
is
no
statute
in
illinois.
mr.
james
l.
fox
that's
right.
furthermore,
the
illinois
legislature
has
had
before
it
twice
within
the
last
four
or
five
years
bills
to
provide
interest
on
tax
refunds.
mr.
james
l.
fox
i
did
not
understand
him
to
say
that.
mr.
james
l.
fox
there
is
no
interest
payable
in
illinois
without
a
statute,
and
there
is
no
statute
and
the
illinois
legislature
has
turned
down
such
a
statute
twice
within
the
last
three
or
four
legislative
sessions.
i
will
not
address,
because
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
interrogation
of
my
colleague
here,
the
collateral
issues
which
were
raised
on
this
particular,
in
the
briefs,
such
as
as
the
1343
argument
and
the
other
arguments
that
were
raised.
counsel
has
adverted,
however,
on
several
occasions
to
the
question
of
the
state
remedies
of
1983.
there
is
no
grounds
for
a
state
1983
remedy.
in
fact
in
a
damage
action,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
there
just
isn't
any
case
to
which
you
can
point.
there
is
no
rule,
of
course,
as
note
1
in
maine
v.
thiboutat
pointed
out,
that
the
state
must
hear
a
1983
action,
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
intrusive
by
the
federal
judiciary
into
the
state
than
to
require
the
state
of
illinois,
let's
say,
first
to
hear
that
kind
of
1983
action;
secondly,
to
grant
an
injunction
or
damages;
thirdly,
perhaps,
to
grant
attorneys'
fees,
which
are
not
provided
for
under
the
statute,
or
to
pay
interest,
or
to
waive
its
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
which
the
state
absolutely
declined,
the
court
in
the
state
absolutely
declined
to
do
in
the
fulton
market
case,
which
we
have
cited,
because
that
was
taken
up
on
a
1983
case,
citing
monroe
v.
pape,
damico,
mcneese,
and
the
other
cases,
for
failure
to
exhaust
notwithstanding
a
constitutional
deprivation.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
shook
its
head
and
said,
no,
after
the
appellate
court
had
overruled
the
trial
court.
the
supreme
court
reversed
and
said,
no,
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue,
the
plaintiff
here
did
not
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies,
and
notwithstanding
any
federal
claims
and
so
forth
which
were
briefed
and
argued,
we're
not
going
to
waive
our
exhaustion
relief.
counsel,
i
think,
has
been
most
forthright
in
saying
that
he
cannot
speak
for
the
illinois
court,
that
he
cannot
assure
us
that
there
would
be
any
remedy
under
1983
or
any
other
remedy
in
the
illinois
court.
and
cromwell
has
been
good
law
for
years
and
years
in
the
united
states.
mr.
james
l.
fox
no,
sir.
the
only
possibility,
mr.
justice
white,
under
those
circumstances
would
be
that
under
the
rationale
of
fulton
market
v.
cullerton,
that
we
might
go
back
at
a
later
date
and
sue
for
whatever
other
expenses
we
had.
but,
note,
that
under
an
injunction,
under
an
injunction--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--well,
you
see,
truthfully,
if
we
got
an
injunction,
one,
we
would
not
have
to
pay
the
unjust
moiety.
mr.

secondly,
under
1988,
we
would
be
entitled
to
our
client's
attorneys'
fees,
so
that
the
client
would
be
made
whole
with
an
injunction.
she
would
not
have
to
lay
out
her
money,
and
her
attorneys'
fees
and
costs
would
be
paid.
mr.
james
l.
fox
and,
by
the
way,
there
is
no
such
provision
under
illinois
law,
allowing
the
so-called
rule
of
attorneys'
fees
in
prevailing
in
a
case
such
as
this.
there
is
no
interest,
there
are
no
attorneys'
fees,
there
is
nothing.
neither,
as
we
pointed
out,
is
there
any
interest
even
after
judgment.
mr.
james
l.
fox
if
it
were...
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
it
were
reasonable
interest
in
the
line
with
the
market.
i
merely
point
out--
mr.
james
l.
fox
--that
really
does
not
square
with
reality
in
illinois
at
the
present
time.
on
judgments
against
the
state,
it's
six
percent.
the
internal
revenue
service
under
section
482
is
now
talking
a
range
of
11
to
13
percent.
i
think
the
court
would
then
have
to
face
a
due
process
question
in
the
amount
of
interest.
if
they
allowed
four
percent
or
five
percent
in
a
day
when
we
have
a
15-1/2
percent
prime,
this
is
another
question.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a...
is
it
reasonable?
mr.
james
l.
fox
it's
a
statutory,
yes.
mr.
james
l.
fox
but
again,
and
i
hate
to
bring
the
question
up,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
is
the
payment...
is
the
taking
of
money
today
and
giving
it
back
in
a
lesser
amount
sometime
hence,
is
that
itself
a
denial
of
due
process?
mr.
james
l.
fox
and
as
i
say,
we'll
leave
that
to
fight
for
another
day.
thank
you.
