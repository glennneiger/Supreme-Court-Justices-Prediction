justice
jr.
is
a
1983
action
available
in
state
courts
in
this
kind
of
tax
case?
justice
jr.
you
don't
know
it.
i
gather
from
your
brief
you
question
whether
1983...
we've
never
held
that
a
state
court
must
entertain
a
1983.
justice
jr.
we've
held
it
in
thiboutat
last
term
that
it
may.
justice
jr.
now,
if
there's
no
requirement
that...
you
don't
know
whether
it
will
or
won't,
does
that
bear
on
the
plaintiff's
speedy
and
efficient
remedy?
justice
jr.
my
question
really
is,
it's
clear
that
the
action
is
available
in
the
federal
court;
no
doubt
about
that.
if
it's
uncertain
whether
it's
available
in
the
state
court,
then
why
can't
the
taxpayer
seek
an
injunction
in
federal
court
with
a
1983
suit?
justice
jr.
does
this
imply
that
were
this
1983
action
of
the
taxpayer
in
federal
court
limited
to
a
claim
of
a
damage
remedy,
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument?
justice
jr.
well,
would
you
be
resisting
the
1983
suit,
seeking
only
damages
in
federal
court?
justice
jr.
you
got
less
because
of
inflation,
not
because
you
were
denied
interest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
federal
tax
injunction
act
of
1937
provides
that
the
district
courts
shall
not
enjoin,
suspend
or
restrain
the
assessment,
levy
or
collection
that
any
tax
under
state
law
where
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
may
be
had
in
the
courts
of
such
state.
under
an
illinois
statute,
real
property
owners
who
contest
their
property
taxes
are
required
first
to
exhaust
their
available
administrative
remedies
and
if
unsuccessful,
then
afforded
a
legal
remedy
requiring
the
payment
of
the
tax
under
protest
and
a
subsequent
state
court
challenge.
the
customary
delay
from
time
of
payment
until
receipt
of
refund
upon
successful
protest
is
two
years
and
the
refund
is
not
accompanied
by
a
payment
of
interest.
the
appellee
in
this
case
brought
an
action
in
federal
district
court
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
tax
assessment
against
her
property
and
to
seek
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
was
barred
by
the
federal
tax
injunction
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
dismissal
holding
that
illinois
procedure
of
no
interest
refunds
after
two
years
was
not
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy.
for
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
illinois
refund
procedure
is
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
within
the
meaning
of
those
terms
as
used
in
the
tax
injunction
act.
the
district
court
therefore
correctly
held
that
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
grant
injunctive
relief
was
barred
by
that
act.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
blackmun
joining
the
court's
opinion
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
stevens
dissents
and
joined
by
justices
stewart,
marshall
and
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
