mr.
henry
a.
hauser
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
henry
hauser
and
i'm
an
assistant
state's
attorney,
and
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
certiorari
petition.
certiorari
was
granted
to
the
7th
circuit
last
march.
this
is
a
1983
tax
injunction
case
that
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
and
it
deals
with
1977
local
real
estate
taxes
which
are
assessed
and
contended
to
be
unconstitutionally
assessed
on
the
taxpayer
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
response
of
the
county
tax
officials...
and
that's
mr.
edward
j.
rosewell,
who
is
one
of
the
petitioners.
he
is
the
county
collector.
he
has
duties
under
the
illinois
statutes
to
collect
real
estate
taxes
which
were
assessed
for
1977
against
the
property
owned
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
mr.
tully
is
no
longer
the
county
assessor;
he's
been
replaced
by
mr.
thomas
hynes.
the
response
that
the
petitioners
filed
for
this
1983
action
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
which
was
premised
among
other
things
on
the
federal
anti-tax
injunction
statute.
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
is
set
out
at
appendix,
page
11,
also
sets
out
grounds
that
there
was
not
a
claim
stated,
and
that
there
was
available
to
the
taxpayer,
again,
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
and
also
a
remedy
available
pursuant
to
the
state
statutory
tax
system.
secondly,
it
was
contended
in
that
motion
that
the
state
taxpayer
had
available
to
her
in
this
case
a
1983
action
in
which
she
could
have
raised
all
of
the
claims
which
she
desired
to
raise
in
the
federal
court
injunctive
action.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
yes.
our
contention
is,
your
honor,
that
the
taxpayer
had
available
to
her
a
remedy
under
1983
which
could
have
been
filed
in
the
state
court
under
the
illinois
case
of
alberty
v.
daniel.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
she
certainly
did.
she
had...
one
of
the
facts
which
needs
to
be
made
clear
in
this
case
is
that
the
taxpayer
alleges
in
her
complaint
that
she
had
the
funds
to
pay
the
tax
in
this
case.
therefore,
because
the
taxpayer
had
the
funds
available
to
her
to
pay
the
tax
in
this
case
and
sue
for
a
refund,
there
is
no
threatened
loss
of
the
property
and
there
is
also
available
to
her
the
possibility
of
filing
a
specific
objection
in
the
collector's
annual
application
for
the
sale
of
delinquent
tax
property.
so
that
she
clearly
had
available
to
her
the
statutory
illinois
proceeding.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
our
response
is
that
the
taxpayer
would
have
a
right
to
file
a
1983
action
in
a
state
court
raising
that
precise
claim.
so
that
even
if
that
claim
was
not
available,
and
the
difficulty
with
part
of
this
issue
is
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
not
had
a
chance...
in
fact,
it's
not
been
given
a
chance...
to
rule
on
the
1983
portion
of
a
claim
to
interest.
the
predicate
of
the
taxpayer's
argument
in
this
case
is
basically
the
illinois
supreme
court's
holding
in
clarendon
associates
v.
korzen,
and
lakefront
realty
v.
lorenz.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
it's...
well,
we're
about
five
years
behind
right
now.
the
difficulty...
i
need
to
make
it
clear
that
the
specific
objections
are
treated
separately
from
the
entire
civil
calendar
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
it's
speedy
in
the
sense
that
if
the
taxpayer...
it's
available
to
the
taxpayer,
and
the
taxpayer
has
a
damage
remedy
that...
at
least
a
taxpayer
who
can
pay
has
a
damage
remedy
available
to
her.
and
if
the...
i
think
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
was
based
on
tully
v.
griffin.
the
question
in
the
anti-tax
injunction
statute
is
whether
there
would
be
a
federal
right
which
would
otherwise
be
lost?
and
there
is
no
right
under
illinois
law
to
interest.
so
the
question
comes
down
to,
and
it's
a
question
that's
not
been
resolved
in
illinois,
and
the
question
is...
and
it's,
i
don't
think,
presented
in
this
case...
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
interest.
now,
the
way
this
case
has
been
pled,
the
taxpayer
has
not
asserted,
we
suggest,
a
constitutional
right
to
interest,
but
it's--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well
i
think
that
in
that
aspect
one
has
to
balance
the
threatened
harm
from
a
federal
tax
injunction
against
the
delay
or
the
harm
that's
caused
to
the
taxpayer.
now
if
the
taxpayer
has
available
to
her
in
this
case,
as
she
did,
a
federal
damage
remedy,
or--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
she
would
have
to
show
that,
judge.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
again
we
argue
the
policy
that
under
tully
v.
griffin,
as
long
as
long
as
the
taxpayer
suffers
no
irreparable
injury,
that
whatever
one
might
want
to
say
qualitatively--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--no,
your
honor.
it
can
be
a
serious
matter,
and
it
certainly
can
support
a
damage
claim.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
then,
what's
the...
i
question
the
policy
behind
the
other
side
of
the
argument
that
there
is
some
reason
why
there
should
be,
why
that
must
lay?
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
the
damage
remedy
certainly
does
that,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
let
me
refocus
that.
if
the
taxpayer
can
demonstrate
an
unconstitutional
overassessment
and
if
in
fact
the
interest
is
a
measure
of
damages,
then
the
taxpayer
will
have
a
right
to
interest,
and
a
taxpayer
is
therefore
made
whole.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
we
do
not...
the
difficulty--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--right.
that's
exactly
right.
in
the
argument
that
lawsuit
has
indeed
already
been
filed
and
that
cause
of
action
basically
acknowledged
by
the
7th
circuit.
so
we
have
a
disappearance
here
of...
you
have
a
federal
tax
injunction
where
the
taxpayer
has
available
to
her
a
federal
damage
remedy.
i
need
to
make
one
thing
clear--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
that's
so;
that's
so.
but
why
else?
in
other
words,
the
policy
is,
the
real
question
is
the
policy
behind
the
federal
injunction
for
state
taxes.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
risk...
the
complaint
alleges,
and
i
need
to
clarify
this,
the
complaint
alleges
a
two-year
delay,
not
a
five-year
delay.
when
i
responded
to
one
of
the
justices'
questions,
the
very
last
year
that's
still
open
in
cook
county
is
five
years
old,
but
the
average
delay
which
is
alleged
under
this
remedy
is
two
years,
and
that's
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
this
doesn't
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
has
90
days
within
the
filing
of
a
specific
objection
to
arrange
a
pre-trial
settlement
discussion
with
the
lawyers
for
the
county.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
the
calendar
of
the
federal
court?
it's
probably
as
crowded
as
any
federal
district
court
in
the
nation.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
we
don't
have
any
federal
tax
cases,
your
honor,
with
which
we
can
measure
this.
this
is
a
leading
case.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that
i
couldn't
say,
your
honor.
that
i
couldn't
say.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
the
record
doesn't
show
it.
i
wish
i
could
help
you
out
there
but
i
can't.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
it's
probably...
the
question
is
whether
that,
whether
the
federal
remedy
is
any
speedier
than
the
state,
if
we're
talking
about
damage
remedies.
the
question
is,
what
has
the
taxpayer
lost
if
she
gets
all
of
the
interest
back?
in
other
words,
if
the
delay
deprives
the
taxpayer
of
the
use--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--except
that
her
position
is
that
she--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--under
illinois
law.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
we
argue
that
also.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
if
she
can
demonstrate
the
right
to
the
interest,
she
ought
not...
unless
she
can
demonstrate
the
right
to
interest--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--i
couldn't,
your
honor,
because
we
oppose
that
position,
and
i...
but
i
say
this,
that
unless
the
taxpayer
can
demonstrate
a
right
to
interest
and
demonstrate...
or,
let's
say,
interest
may
be
the
wrong
word.
perhaps
the
taxpayer
must
demonstrate
a
right
to
the
recompense
or
the
damages
for
the
loss
of
the
use
value
of
the
money
that's
tied
up
during
the
tax
proceedings.
now,
that's
the...
that's
argued
in
the
taxpayer's
brief.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
we
argue
that
too,
your
honor.
we
argue
that
the
allegations
that
are
made
in
the
complaint
are
not
sufficient
to
demonstrate
a
violation
of
her
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
now--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
the
question
is
whether
she's
entitled
to
an
injunction
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
and
the
question
in
the
federal
court
is
whether...
not
only
whether
there's
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
state
court,
but
also
whether
there's
a
remedy
in
the
federal
court.
now,
she
must
of
course
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
right,
because,
if
in
other
words
you--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--not...
the
way--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--as
a
matter
of
illinois
statutory
construction,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
or
the
availability
in
federal
court
of
a
similar
damage
remedy
which
is
the
predicate
for
our
state
argument.
the
point
that's
raised
is
that
if...
the
question
is,
and
i
think
i
need
to
at
the
outset
distinguish
between
the
limitation
that's
contained
in
1341,
which
is
a
limitation
on
injunctions.
it
creates
no
jurisdiction.
1341
is
a
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
federal
injunctive
power,
but
it
is
a
limitation
which
was
necessitated
initially
by
the
abuse
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
where
taxpayers
from
outside
of
states
would
tie
up
state
taxes,
like
has
happened
in
illinois,
and
has
happened
in
this
case,
effectively,
where
the
taxes
have
been
tied
up
now
for
nearly
two
years
without
even
the
matter
being
decided.
but
there's
a
further
view
when
you
have
a
1983
action
being
made,
being
stated,
because
that's
different
from
a
diversity
case.
in
other
words,
the
focus
in
a
1341
action
where
diversity
is
involved
is
solely
upon
the
state
remedies,
because
the
federal
court
had
no
right
to
make
federal
remedies
for
the
state
courts
under
diversity
jurisdiction.
but
under
1341,
and
under
the
civil
rights
act,
where
you
have
a
jurisdictional
predicate
based
on
federal
statute,
then
the
question
has
to
go
back
really
to
the
historical
precedent.
cases
like
matthews
v.
rodgers,
and
great
lakes
dredge
&
dock
v.
huffman.
and
tully
v.
griffin
is
a
situation
where
that
question
is
met.
and
the
articulation
of
the
equity
rule
is
that
a
federal
court
is
under
an
equitable
duty
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
a
state's
collection
of
its
revenue
except
in
cases
where
an
assertive
federal
right
might
otherwise
be
lost.
now,
the
question
is
where--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
that's
my
question
too,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that's
right.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
here's
how
it
happened,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--yes.
one
of
those
has
split,
and
the
last
two
questions
are
the
1983,
state
1983
and
the
state
statutory
remedy.
the
question
about
1983
was
raised
before
the
district
court.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
it's
not...
we
suggest
that
it
is.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
i
suggest
that
if
the
decision
of
the
7th
circuit
is
incorrect,
then
if
the
decision
of
judge
bua
in
the
district
court
was
correct
but
for
the
wrong
reasons,
then
it
simply
makes
sense
to
reach
that
issue
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy.
now,
i
pointed
out,
and
i
did
argue
and
i
did
set
out
in
my
brief
that
we
were
raising
a
question
that
arguably
might
not
be
available
below,
and
we
did
argue
in
our
brief
that
we
perceived
the
question
to
be
subsumed
within
that
question.
so--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--my
response
to
that
is
that--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
that's
the
question
that
they
decided,
but--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
no,
there's
two
questions.
there's
the--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
that
question
includes
both
whether
the
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
is
included
in
a
state
1983
action
which
in
illinois
state--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--right.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
yes,
it
really
did.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
that's
a
fundamental
question
which
is--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--it
is
a
different
question,
although
i
think
that
if
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
lacking,
again,
the
district
court
ruled
in
the
favor
of
the
county,
on
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
allow
a
judge
to
be
reversed,
if
he
was
right
for
the
wrong
reason.
i
think
that
might
be
more
the
failure
to
articulate
the
reasons
for
a
decision
and
it
might
be
more
appropriate
to
encourage
district
courts
to
articulate
the
reasons
for
their
opinions.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
the
difficulty--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
the
difficulty
is
that
the
usual
way
that
these
tax
cases
go
is
under
a
1341
analysis
of
the
federal
tax
injunction
statute.
and
the
other
questions
get
subsumed,
in
fact,
lost.
and
if
there
are
underlying
difficulties
and
those
cases
present
important
issues,
then
it's
the
underlying
issues
that
that
case
is
going
to
be
cited
as
authority
for.
i
think
that
for
that
reason
we
thought
it
important
not
to
raise
for
the
court,
to
give
your
honors
a
chance
to
rule
on
it.
and
we
indicated
that
we
were
raising
the
issues
that
had
not
been
particularly
presented
to
the
district
court.
fundamentally,
the
problem
that
i
need
to
return
to
is
the
relationship
between
1341
and
the
historical
overview
that
is
set
forth
in
tully
v.
griffin,
where
a
federal
court
is
said
to
be
under
an
equitable
duty
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
the
state's
collection
of
its
revenues
except
in
cases
where
an
asserted
federal
right
might
otherwise
be
lost.
unless
the
taxpayer
can
demonstrate
an
asserted
federal
right,
demonstrate
that
right,
assert
it,
and
prove
it,
then
there
ought
not
to
be
a
federal
injunction.
if
the
facts
and
if
the
complaint
indicates
that
the
taxpayer
will
not
suffer
irreparable
injury,
that
is,
that
the
taxpayer
will
not
suffer
an
injury
which
can't
be
recompensed
by
money...
and
we're
talking
about
money
here;
we're
not
talking
about
the
loss
of
the
taxpayer's
property.
in
other
words,
because
the
taxpayer
had
available
to
her
the
state...
the
damage
remedy,
because
she
was
able
to
pay,
a
state
refund
remedy,
there
is
no
threat
in
this
case
of
loss
of
the
property.
if
the
property
isn't
lost,
then
we're
only
talking
about
interest,
and
if
that's
the
federal
right
that's
going
to
be
lost,
then
the
taxpayer
can
certainly
assert
that
right,
that
there's
no
threat
of
the
loss
of
that
federal
right,
then
we
respectfully
suggest
that
under
tully
v.
griffin
there
is
no
right
to
a
federal
injunction.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
we
don't
know
that,
your
honor,
because
it's
never
been
filed.
the--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--that's
correct.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that
it
may.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
yes.
well,
hillsborough
v.
cromwell
says
that
if
the
remedy
in
the
state
court
is
uncertain,
then
1341
is
avoided.
but
our
argument
is
that
the
facts
in
hillsborough
were
a
situation
where
the
uncertainty
was
not
the
result
of
a
failure
of
any
taxpayers
to
file
the
suit.
in
other
words,
you
can't
establish
a
state
remedy,
particularly
a
new
remedy
under
1983
unless
some
taxpayers
file
it.
and
there's
never
been
a
1983
tax
case
filed
in
the
state
court,
because
the
history
has
been
that
those
get
filed
in
the
federal
court.
it's
only
after
cases
when
people
start
thinking
along
the
lines
of
filing
1983
cases
in
the
state
court,
as
occurred
in
martinez,
and
it's
occurred
in
thiboutat,
that
you
have
this
clash--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--the
question
is,
there's
a
failure,
i
think,
to
distinguish
between
injunctive
relief
as
against
damage
relief.
now,
alberty
was
a
damage
case,
and
there's
a
federal
case...
fulton
market,
the
7th
circuit;
fulton
market
v.
cullerton,
which
is
a
damage
case
also,
which
deals
with
allegations
very
similar
to
this
case.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
analysis
has
to
be
in
view
of
the
disruption
that's
created
to
a
state
tax
system
by
a
tax
injunction,
where
tax
machinery
is
disrupted,
where
there's
an
obstruction
of
revenue,
perhaps
damaging
the
budget,
where
there's
a
risk,
of
taxpayer
insolvency
which
is
shifted
to
the
state,
and
where
there
are
state
law
questions
that
need
to
get
sorted
out
all
along.
those
are
all
factors
which
were
set
out
in
your
perez
concurrence
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
in
that
situation
it's
necessary
to
balance
the
damages
threatened
to
the
state,
as
against
what
we
might
consider
the
best
illinois
damage
remedy.
and
if
the
fact
is
that
the
taxpayer
will
not
suffer
any
irreparable
injury,
that
the
taxpayer
will
not
lose
her
property
and
must
merely
wait
to
be
recompensed
by
damages
for
a
claim
which
she
must
establish
under
tully,
because
if
she
can't
establish
the
claim
under
tully
then
there's
no
federal
right
which
will
be
lost,
then
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
policy
underlying
federal
tax
injunctions
and
the
limit
of
those
federal
tax
limitation
injunctions--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
that.
if
there
was
no--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--we
resisted
that
in
federal
court
and
we
lost
in
the
7th
circuit
and
certiorari
was
denied.
i
think
with
two
justices
dissenting
from
the
denial.
so
the
law
as
it
stands...
and
we
accept
the
law
as
it
stands...
is
that
there
is
a
federal
damage
remedy
that's
available
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
for
any
money
damages
that
we
felt--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--i
think
that--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
the
difficulty
we--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--i
think
it
might--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--it
will
be
a
state
determination
of
the
federal
law.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
right.
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
supports
my
position,
because
when
the
illinois
courts
look
to
the--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
yes--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
here's
what
i
would
say
to
that--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--the
answer
is
that
the
state
court
will
look
to
federal
law,
much
the
same
way
that
federal
courts
look
to
state
law
in
diversity
jurisdictions.
you
have
a
straight
example
of
reverse
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
that
is,
i
think
that
once
martinez
is
decided
the
way
it
is
and
once
maine
v.
thiboutat
is
decided
the
way
it
is,
that's
a
problem
that's
created.
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
because
if
you
look
at
the
final,
in
the
final
analysis,
the
taxpayer
indeed
has
a
choice.
the
taxpayer,
who
is
not
threatened
with
irreparable
injury,
has
a
choice
of
filing
either
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
court
to
recoup
the
damages
which
are
monetary
damages
threatened
by
those
parts
of
the
illinois
remedy
to
which
she
objects.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
why
that's
so
is
because
initially
1341
was
directed
to
diversity
actions.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
but
we
do
argue
that
in
tully
v.
griffin,
a
1341
case
that
under
the
broader
view
of
equity
law,
that
a
federal
court
is
under
an
equitable
duty
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
a
state's
collection
of
its
revenue,
except
in
cases
where
a
federal
right
may
otherwise
be
lost,
and
the
view
is
not
restricted
solely
to
the
state
remedy,
but
to
the
federal
remedy
too.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that's
right.
my
response
to
that
is,
your
honor,
that
unless
you
distinguish
between
1341
and
the
traditional
limitations
put
on
any
federal
district
court
in
dispensing
injunctions,
you
will
end
up
with
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
federal
damage
remedy,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
that
will--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--yes.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
well,
no.
we
think
the
question
is
broader
because
of
the
language
in
tully
v.
griffin,
in
tully
v.
griffin.
and
that's
because
you
have
the
limitation
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
as
you
start
creating
more
federal
rights,
either
in
federal
question
jurisdiction
by
statutes
or
in
1983
by
expanding
that
jurisdiction,
it's
necessary
to
view
the
equitable
powers
of
the
district
courts
in
the
broader
view,
the
one
that's
articulated
in
tully
v.
griffin,
which
is
clearly
a
1341
case.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
i
have
a
case,
i
cited
it
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
alberty
v.
daniel.
and
alberty
v.
daniel
indicates
the
willingness
of
illinois
courts
to
accept
1983--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--well,
your
honor,
if
your
honor
demands
a
case,
me
to
demonstrate
a
case
that's
never
been
filed,
i
can't.
and
no
taxpayer--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
that
is--
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
--the
only
point
i
would
make,
your
honor,
is
that
as
far
as
1983
is
concerned,
the
illinois
appellate
court
in
the
district
in
which
the
taxpayer's
property
is
located
has
accepted
jurisdiction
of
a
1983
action
arising
out
of
employment
claims.
it
wasn't
a
tax
case;
but
no
illinois
court
has
ever
denied
a
1983
tax
claim.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
a.
hauser
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
there's
a
disagreement
with
that,
then
that
changes
the
availability
of
remedies
altogether.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
