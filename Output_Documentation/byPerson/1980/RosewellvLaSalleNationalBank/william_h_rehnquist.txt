justice
rehnquist
well,
then
she
wouldn't...
you
can
turn
that
argument
on
its
head
too,
and
say
that
if
she
can't
demonstrate
that
she
has
a
right
to
what
she's
claiming,
she's
not
entitled
to
the
injunction
that
she's
claiming,
not
because
of
the
anti-injunction
statute,
but
because
of
a
shortcoming
in
her
pleadings.
justice
rehnquist
but
if
the
remedy
you're
relying
on
to
get
you
out
from
under
1341
is
a
damage
suit
in
federal
court,
it
simply
doesn't
come
within
the
language
of
1341.
justice
rehnquist
well,
however
it
may
be,
you
can't
invoke
1341
by
saying
that
she
has
an
adequate
damage
remedy
in
federal
court.
because
it
doesn't
come
in
under
the
terms
of
1341.
justice
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
certain
circularity
to
that,
though,
counsel,
isn't
there?
because
if
it
opens
the
doors
to
federal
courts
but
is
not
required
to
pay
interest,
all
you
get
is
the
same
relief
in
federal
court
as
you
would
have
gotten
in
state
court,
that
is,
your
refund
without
interest.
justice
rehnquist
now,
what
is
that?
interest?
justice
rehnquist
it's
an
equal
protection
claim?
justice
rehnquist
but
then,
why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
that
a
state
doesn't
allow
interest,
if
you
have
no
constitutional
right
to
it?
justice
rehnquist
so,
even
though
it
is
not
a
constitutional
violation,
it
brings
into
play,
it
relieves
you
from
the
bar
of
1341?
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
illinois
was
not
required
to
pay
interest?
justice
rehnquist
then
did
i
misunderstand
you
just
now
in
saying
that
it
is?
i
mean,
what's
less,
less
than
what?
you
said
they
got
back
less.
why
less?
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
what
1341
says,
isn't
it?
you
cannot
enjoin
in
federal
court
the
situation
that
you
specify,
if
it's
a
tax...
if
it's
limited
to
taxation.
justice
rehnquist
but
1341
purports
to
impose
a
prohibition
over
and
above
the
normal
injunctive
precautions,
doesn't
it?
justice
rehnquist
what
would
be
a
reasonable
limit,
in
your
mind?
presumably
there
isn't
a
jurisdiction
in
the
country
that
is
going
to
give
you
your
taxes
back
on
the
same
day
you
pay
them
under
protest.
would
20
days
be
sufficient?
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
state
remedy
contemplated
by
1341
must
be
injunctive
in
nature?
that
a
payment
under
protest
and
ultimate
refund,
even
in
a
very
short
period
of
time,
isn't
adequate?
