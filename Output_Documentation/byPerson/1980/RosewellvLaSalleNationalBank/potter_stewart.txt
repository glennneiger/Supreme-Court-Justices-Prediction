justice
stewart
that
was
another
question.
that
leads
to
my
more
threshold
question,
and
that
is
this:
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
you
listed
only
one
question.
justice
stewart
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
7th
circuit
referred
to
that
question
as
the
sole
question.
justice
stewart
i'm
looking
at
page
2a
of
the
certiorari
petition.
justice
stewart
now,
all
of
a
sudden,
on
the
argument,
we
have
three
questions.
how'd
that
happen?
justice
stewart
one
of
those
questions
is
the
one
to
which
my
brother
marshall
has
just
directed
your
attention.
justice
stewart
but
it's
not
a
question,
then,
on
which
we
granted
certiorari,
nor
fairly
subsumed
within
it,
is
it?
justice
stewart
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
a
single
question
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
7th
circuit
said
they
had
a
single,
and
to
use
their
word,
s-o-l-e,
sole
question.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stewart
then
the
only
question
presented
in
the
certiorari
petition
and
the
only
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
undertook
to
decide
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
state
courts.
is
that
correct?
justice
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stewart
yes.
and
the
only
question
presented
on
your
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
stewart
well,
i
only
see
one,
and
i'm
looking
at
page
2
of
your
petition
for
certiorari:
"question
presented".
and
there's
only
one
question.
justice
stewart
yes.
whether
or
not
there
was
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
state
courts.
justice
stewart
well,
that's
a
fundamental
and
quite
a
different
question
from
the
one
embraced
in
your
certiorari
petition
on
which
we
granted.
justice
stewart
mr.
hauser,
i
think
my
brother
rehnquist's
point
is
that
the
plain
language
of
1341
says
that
a
federal
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
state
taxes
where
there
is
a
speedy,
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
in
the
state
courts.
justice
stewart
well,
there
might
be
reasons
not
to
issue
an
injunction
in
various
cases,
depending
upon--
justice
stewart
--in
any
particular
case,
depending
upon
the
generally
applicable
maximus
of
equity
with
respect
to
irreparable
damage
and
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
the
rest
of
it.
but
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
such
an
injunction
is
barred
by
1341,
and
that's
the
only
question,
isn't
it?
justice
stewart
yes,
but
the
only
question
is,
whether
or
not
1341
bars
an
injunction.
justice
stewart
there's
no
question
here
about
whether
or
not,
for
some
other
reason,
you
may
not
be
entitled
to
an
injunction.
justice
stewart
that
case
is
not
in
your
brief,
is
it,
counsel?
justice
stewart
chrysler
corporation?
justice
stewart
i
see.
all
this
discussion,
and
i've
contributed
to
it,
talking
about
the
specific
words,
has
maybe
taken
us
off
of
what
was
the
genesis
of
the
anti-injunction
act?
wasn't
it
to
mandate
a
direction
to
the
federal
courts
to
keep
hands
off
of
state
tax
procedures?
just
let
the
states
work
it
out
on
their
own?
justice
stewart
well,
this
isn't
a
due
process
question.
it's
a
statutory
question--
justice
stewart
--of
whether
or
not
there
exists
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
courts
of
the
state.
