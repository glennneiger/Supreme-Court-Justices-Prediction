justice
stevens
mr.
hauser,
isn't
it
possible
that
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
interest,
but
that
nevertheless,
the
denial
of
interest
when
you
have
to
wait
four
or
five
years
to
get
your
money
back,
would
prevent
the
remedy
from
being
speedy,
adequate,
and
efficient,
or
whatever
the
statutory
language
is?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
federal
damage
remedy?
what
will
that
give
her?
doesn't
that
raise
the
same
question?
she
only
gets
interest
if
she
has
a
constitutional
right
to
the
interest.
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
that
responds
to
my
question
that
one
might
assume
there's
no
federal
constitutional
right
to
interest,
and
nevertheless
feel
that
a
remedy
which
denies
interest
on
withheld
money
for
a
five-year
period
is
not
an
adequate
remedy,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
surely
irreparable
if
you
lose
the
use
of
the
money
for
five
years.
you're
never
going
to
get
it
back.
that's
irreparable.
maybe
it
isn't
serious
enough
to
trouble
you
but
it
is
irreparable.
justice
stevens
well,
but
it
only
supports
a
damage
claim
if
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
interest.
justice
stevens
well,
the
reason
would
be
that
an
adequate
remedy
ought
to
make
the
litigant
who's
been
harmed
whole.
that
would
be
the
reasoning,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
these
are
all
"ifs".
you
don't
concede
on
behalf
of
the
county,
do
you,
that
she's
entitled
to
interest?
justice
stevens
you
just
say
she's
got
a
right
to
file
another
lawsuit
and
see
if
she
can
get
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
hauser,
you
keep
saying,
if
she
gets
the
interest
back.
but
your
position
is
she's
not
entitled
to
interest.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stevens
i
know
what
her
position
is,
but
your
position
is
that
she's
not
entitled
to
interest.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
stevens
under
illinois
law
or
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
stevens
yes.
you
say
she's
not
entitled
to
interest,
so
how
can
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
she
might
win
her
lawsuit
as
the
reason
why
she
should
lose
her
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
yes,
i
know,
but
you
don't
concede
she
has
any
right
to
interest.
justice
stevens
but
your
point
is,
your
question
did
include
two
alternative
state
remedies,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
didn't
include
the
propriety
of
a
federal
1983
action.
justice
stevens
mr.
hauser,
just
one
question,
if
i
may.
this
argument
that
you're
now
making
really
depends
on
our
agreeing
with
the
7th
circuit
decision
in
the
fulton
market
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
fox,
if
the
state
of
illinois
amended
its
procedure
to
allow
interest
at
something
that
may
be
less
than
the
prime
rate,
provided
no
recovery
of
attorneys'
fees
or
anything
else,
would
it
then
be
an
adequate
remedy,
in
your
judgment?
justice
stevens
say,
it's
the
same
provision
they
have,
whatever
the
interest
rate
is,
on
judgments
now?
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
