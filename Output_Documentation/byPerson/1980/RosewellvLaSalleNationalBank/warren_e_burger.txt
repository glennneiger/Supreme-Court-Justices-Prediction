chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
rosewell
v.
lasalle
national
bank.
mr.
hauser,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
burger
a
1983
action
in
the
state
court,
are
you
referring
to,
now?
chief
justice
burger
any
other
remedies
besides
1983
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
burger
well,
her
response
to
that
in
part
is
that
since
the
state
pays
no
interest
on
the
tax
while
the
refund's
being
litigated,
that
that's
not
an
efficient
remedy.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
burger
well,
five
years
at
15
percent
a
year,
or
even
ten,
to
make
it
easier
to
compute,
at
least
for
me,
that
doesn't
make
them
very
whole,
does
it?
chief
justice
burger
what's
the
civil
calendar
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fox?
chief
justice
burger
do
you
equate
inadequate
with
inefficient?
chief
justice
burger
well,
there
are
a
great
many
claims
against
the
united
states
in
which
no
interest
is
allowed.
not
in
this
context,
but
would
you
say
that
that's
not
an
adequate
remedy
that
might
lay
a
foundation
for
some
other
type
of
relief
such
as
equitable
relief?
chief
justice
burger
well,
haven't
you
got
a
sovereign
here?
chief
justice
burger
now
you're
talking
about
a
fifth
amendment
taking?
chief
justice
burger
well,
but
you've
said
it's
not
in
this
case,
but
you've
put
it
in
the
case.
chief
justice
burger
i'm
not
saying
this
critically.
chief
justice
burger
i
hope
it's
analytically.
chief
justice
burger
you're
really
raising
a
taking
point
when
you
make
that
argument,
a
point
which
you
then
say
is
not
in
the
case.
chief
justice
burger
well,
what
you're
saying,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
you
treat
"efficient"
as
a
synonym
for
"adequate".
and
this
remedy
is
not
efficient,
that
is,
adequate,
because
it
isn't
speedy.
chief
justice
burger
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
plain
means
in
this
setting.
chief
justice
burger
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means.
plain
or
fancy
wouldn't
make
much
difference.
the
important
thing
is
whether
it's
speedy
and
whether
it's
adequate.
and
speedy
and
adequate
are
really
interrelated,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
burger
if
it
were
speedy
so
that
you
got
it
in
60
days,
you
wouldn't
be
making
all
this
argument
about
the
dollar
and
the
inflation
and
the
use
of
the
money.
chief
justice
burger
well,
but
the
act
doesn't
make
any
distinction,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
rosewell
against
lasalle
national
bank
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
