mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--not
at
all.
we
only
get
to
the
question
of
section
3(o)
when
a
preliminary
activity
is
deemed
to
be
so
integral
and
indispensable
to
the
primary
work
that
itself
is
primary
work
and
therefore
would
be
compensable.
so
as,
for
instance,
the
court
held
in
steiner,
there
was
chemical
plant
workers
who
the
donning
and
doffing
of
their
clothing
for
work
purposes
was
so
indispensable
to
their
chemical
factory
work,
it
was
deemed
to
be
essential.
in
that
context,
you
might
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
allows
the
union
on
behalf
of
the
employees
and
the
employer
to
provide
for
an
alternative
method
of
compensating
this
type
of
work.
and
in
that
context,
there
are
two
central
inquiries
that
i
would
like
to
address
today.
first,
are
the
items
clothes?
we
think
“
clothes
”
actually
has
some
textual
meaning
here
and
imposes
a
limit,
which
i'd
like
to
discuss
a
bit
further
later.
but
second:
if
the
employee
puts
on
both
clothes
and
some
non-clothes
items,
does
the
overall
process
still
nevertheless
constitute
the
activity
of
changing
clothes?
now,
we
didn't
have
to
go
in
very
deep
depth
into
that
question
in
our
brief
because
all
the
items
here
are
clothes.
but
i
think
it
would
be
actually
quite
useful
to
discuss
for
a
little
bit
the
activity
of
changing
clothes
and
then
to
discuss
the
specifics.
i
think
it
would
help
the
court
out
at
least
in
providing
a
more
general
rule.
the
activity
of
changing
clothes
is
used
in
the
--
in
the
statute
to
exclude
time
spent
in
changing
clothes.
congress
used
the
gerund
“
changing
”
to
describe
an
activity.
it
is
a
verb
form
that's
modified
by
changing,
by
clothes.
so
it
is
an
activity
of
changing
clothes.
we
think
that
activity
also
includes
ancillary
matters.
so
for
instance,
if
a
worker
comes
into
a
locker
room,
spends
some
time
doing
the
combination
on
the
locker,
opens
it
up,
take
--
opens
the
locker,
that
is
not
actually
changing
clothes
per
se,
but
it's
part
of
the
activity
of
changing
clothes.
so,
for
instance,
if
the
worker
also
happens
to
put
on
some
goggles,
pop
in
an
ear
plug,
maybe
even
snap
on
a
utility
belt
in
the
context
of
changing
clothes,
those
things
are
part
of
“
changing
clothes
”
as
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
on
the
margin,
we
are
largely
the
same.
i
think
for
the
mine
run
of
cases,
we
will
be
at
the
same
result.
however,
there
are
some
marginal
cases
where
there
is
a
collection
of
equipment,
what
we
would
deem
to
be
equipment,
which
is
put
on
by
an
employee
that
is
so
significant
that
it
no
longer
can
be
fairly
treated
in
conjunction
with
changing
clothes.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
this
is
an
area
--
an
issue
that
comes
up
frequently
in
the
meat
packing
industry.
and
i
can
explain
--
i
need
to
explain
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
to
explain
why
we
think
that
that
is
a
much
more
difficult
question.
so
in
the
meat
packing
industry,
for
instance,
particularly
meat
packers
that
are
rendering
large
portions
of
the
beef,
either
with
electric
saws
or
very
sharp
knives
or
similar
instruments,
they
actually
have
to
put
on
what
the
government
considers
to
be
or
has
considered
to
be
items
of
equipment.
so,
for
instance,
the
meat
packer
might
have
a
chain
mail
kind
of
like
armor
sleeve,
chain
mail
gloves,
another
sleeve,
chain
mail
kind
of
all
over
the
front
end,
a
belly
guard,
a
plexiglas
belly
guard.
this
is
something
that
is
very
rigid.
you
can't
even
sit
down
on
it,
and
in
fact,
you
have
to
sterilize
it
in
a
chemical
bath
before
you
go
into
the
plant.
you
have
metal
arm
guard
--
or
a
metal
or,
now,
plexiglas
because
of
weight
--
arm
guard
on
the
front
that
helps
to
deflect
blows
for
your
non-knife
arm.
these
types
of
things,
we
think,
would
not
normally
be
thought
of
as
clothing.
and
so
when
you
put
on
a
smock,
either
before
or
under
or
over
it,
we
think
that
the
overall
process
there
might
not
be
fairly
deemed
to
be
considered
changing
clothes.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
right.
well,
that
may
well
--
this
is
again
going
to
be
somewhat
fact-dependent,
and
i
don't
mean
to
provide
a
general
rule
for
all
cases.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
no,
no.
i
think,
while
we
are
trying
to
general
principles,
they're
not
necessarily
going
to
resolve
all
cases,
and
they're
not
always
going
to
make
the
case
easy,
and
i
think
on
the
margin,
and
the
meat
packer
does
involve
a
marginal
case,
you're
going
to
have
the
questions.
if
it's
just
one
item--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--our
point
is
a
linguistic
point,
which
is
to
say
i
don't
think
all
these
things
are
normally
characterized
as
clothing.
for
instance,
there
are
certain
items
in
the
body
that
are
so
distinctive
in
form
and
function
they
don't
have
normal
analogues
in
what
you
would
find
people
wearing
in
ordinary
garments,
you
know,
in
everyday
life,
that
it's
deemed
to
be
different.
there
are
certain
armor-type
things,
and
i
think
maybe
because
etymologically
because
armor
with
the
unique
military
context
tends
to
--
we
tend
to
call
these
things
equipment.
but
for
instance,
the
belly
guards.
in
ibp,
this
court
called
those
things
“
protective
equipment
”,
and
i
think
that's
the
normal
use
of
the
term
in
that
context.
just
because
you
might
say,
oh,
it's
a
vest,
a
chain
mail
vest
for
the
specific
function,
particularly
when
aggregated
with
the
rest
of
the
equipment
used
in
the
meat
packing
industry,
makes
it
an
arguably
different
case.
this
case,
however,
i
think
is
quite
different,
and
i
wouldn't
necessarily
use
the
term
“
de
minimis
”.
we
agree
with
the
general
concept
that
the
seventh
circuit
reached,
but
de
minimis
is
a
term
of
art
in
the
flsa.
it
involves,
as
we
explained
to
the
court,
in
our
brief,
which
is
the
companion
case
to
ibp,
it
requires
an
aggregation
of
all
the
time
deemed
to
be
de
minimis.
there
is
a
regulation,
section
785.47,
that
imposes
some
other
requirements.
we
think
it's
not
so
helpful
to
use
that
term.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
it
means
that
when
the
process
is
predominantly
involving
equipment
and
not
clothes,
we
would
think
that
it's
different.
and
--
and
i
don't
think
there's
really
any
question
that
there
has
to
be
a
line.
for
instance,
if
an
employer
had
an
employee
go
out
and
as
part
of
the
changing
clothes
also
go
and
collect
your
tools
for
the
day
and
assemble
them
in
your
tool
belt,
no
one
would
say
that's
changing
clothes
even
if,
at
the
end
of
the
--
all
of
that
you
put
on
your
top
--
your
jacket
and
you
walked
out.
so
we're
simply
trying
to
draw
a
line
that
i
think
faithfully
reflects
the
common
understanding
of
clothes
in
this
context.
at
the
same
time,
we
believe
that
the
term
“
clothes
”
is
quite
broad.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i'm
not
--
there
has
to
be--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--there
has
to
be
a
custom
or
practice
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
specific
one.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
think
the
custom--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--on
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--i
think
the
custom
of
practice
was
to
not
separately
compensate.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
so
that
was
actually
made
express--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--in
this
case.
and
i
think
that's
actually
illustrative
of
the
type
of
things
that
we're
talking
about.
remember,
we're
talking
about
a
100
percent
cotton.
if
you
look
at
the
label,
it's
in
the
record.
a
100
percent
cotton
jacket
and
pants.
you've
got,
you
know,
arm
guards,
wrist
--
wristlets
and
leggings,
but
these
things
are
quite
analogous
to
what
we
would
have
in
normal
clothing.
and
then
you
have
some
things
that
are
on
the
edge.
but
we
think
that
when
that's
done
in
conjunction
with
changing
clothes,
that
it's
incidental.
just
as
an
employee
might
put
on
a
name
tag
after
they
dress,
or
put
on
their
id
badge
for
security
purposes,
or
snap
on
a
utility
belt--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--that's
--
that's
our
preference.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
we
think
it
avoids
the
complications
and
problems
with
the
special
doctrine
that
applies
more
generally
in
the
flsa,
which
is
the
de
minimis
--
de
minimis
time
doctrine.
