justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
an
underlying
question
just
for
my
understanding
of
this.
now,
the
unions
are
on
your
side
and
--
i
think.
and
i
wondered
why.
this
is
my
thought,
which
suggests
that
i
may
not
understand
this
perfectly.
it
seemed
like,
to
me,
a
brilliant
statute,
because
if
in
fact
the
unions,
those
they
represent,
the
workers,
don't
want
--
want
to
be
paid
for
donning
and
doffing,
all
they
have
to
do
is
not
put
something
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
--
and
if
they
do
put
something
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
can
exert
their
bargaining
power
to
get
something
else
which
they
must
want
more.
so
what
you
with
your
narrow
definition
do
is
you
prevent
the
workers
from
doing
that.
so
i
don't
know
why
the
ordinary
worker
would
be
on
your
side
of
it.
now,
i
say
that
because
i
want
you
to
explain
what
i'm
missing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see,
that's
where
the
problem
lies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
way
around
that
that
doesn't
involve
this
case,
the
secretary
of
labor?
or
i
guess
you
can
amend
the
statute.
that's
tough.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
what
i
think
he's
saying
is
this,
that
my
puzzle
was,
why
was
this
a
big
deal
for
the
unions?
all
they
have
to
do
is
keep
their
mouths
shut
and
the
employer
is
going
to
have
to
go
to
them
and
say,
we
want
this
in
the
agreement.
but
he
says:
you
haven't
read
those
words
“
custom
or
practice
”,
and
if
you
see
the
words
“
custom
or
practice
”
you'll
see
that
an
awful
lot
of
businesses
or
firms
or
manufacturing
across
the
country
actually
has
long
had
a
custom
or
practice
where
they
didn't
pay
for
that
or
they
didn't
exclude
it,
or
they
didn't
--
so
in
those
circumstances,
it's
the
union
that's
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
employer
and
say:
please
put
some
other
words
in
the
agreement
so
we
get
this
out
of
the
statute.
and
now
i
have
no
idea
--
i
think
that's
what
his
point
was.
and
of
course
this
is
an
empirical
question
in
part
of,
that
kind
of
point,
which
is
logically
sound,
affects
a
certain
number
of
workers
in
industries.
and
i
would
next
be
curious
either
you
or
the
sg
or
anyone
has
some
estimate
of
what
we
are
talking
about
quantitatively.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
it
be
difficult?
why
not
just
say
clothes,
at
least
from
your
point
of
view,
clothes
are
--
are
those
items
that
have,
as
a
significant
purpose,
the
covering
of
one's
body.
that's
not
the
purpose
of
eyeglasses;
it's
not
the
purpose
of
wristwatches;
it's
not
the
purpose
of
--
of
cameras
held
around
your
neck;
it's
not
the
purpose
even
of
an
ipod.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
opening
your
locker
is
not
clothes.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
not
--
but
still,
we're
back
to
the
statute
which
says
“
clothes
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
what's
wrong
with
the
definition
i
just
proposed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
--
that's
up
to
them
how
they
negotiate.
but
--
but
the
statute
says
“
clothes
”,
so
we
would
have
to
pay
for
the
clothes
time.
they'd
have
to
pay
for
the
clothes
time
unless
it's
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
--
you
know,
if
it's
in
the
collective
bargaining
--
unless
it's
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
custom
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
why
--
why
does
it
include
eyeglasses?
eyeglasses
do
not
have
as
a
principal
--
as
a
significant
purpose
the
covering
of
one's
body.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
maybe
we
can
call
them
constructive
clothes,
which
means
they're
not
clothes.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
estimate
on
the
empirical
--
there
are
only
two
people
that
know,
the
department
of
labor
and
the
afl-cio,
and
they
didn't
tell
us,
the
latter.
so
--
so
what
we're
thinking
of,
i
think,
is
workplace
hazard
clothing.
okay?
and
the
problem,
i
think,
that
was
raised
is
that
the
union
can't
stop
--
can't
--
can't
--
can't
make
an
agreement
about
this
without
a
lot
of
trouble
anyway.
they
can't
just
shut
up,
in
other
words,
and
see
that
the
--
there'll
be
compensation
because
there's
a
custom
or
practice
in
the
industry
of
giving
--
of
not
giving
them
compensation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
follow?
do
you
follow--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
yes.
but
they've
had--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--collective
bargaining
agreements
in
steel
forever.
all
right?
so
if
we
go
back
to
--
to
1949
or
1952
and
they
entered
into
some
big
deal
agreement,
i
mean,
what
was
the
custom
or
practice
at
that
time?
i
don't
know.
i
suspect
you
don't
know.
and
i
--
i
wonder
if
the
department
of
labor
knows.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wonder
if
anyone
knows.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
there
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--exactly.
