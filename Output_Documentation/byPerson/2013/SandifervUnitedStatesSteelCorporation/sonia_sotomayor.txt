so
the
guy
who
works
in
a
freezer
is
not
experiencing
a
normal
hazard?
so
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you
have
to
pay
a
worker
who's
in
the
south
pole
overtime
for
putting
on
his
parka?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
put
on
his
leggings
and
things
like
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
--
i
do
have
an
understanding
that
you're
right,
that
jewelry
are
not
clothes,
that
toupees
might
not
be,
that
makeup
is
not,
and
they
cover
the
body.
so
i
agree
that
a
definition
that
says
anything
that
covers
the
body
might
go
too
far.
but
i
do
have
a
problem
with
things
that
look
like
clothes.
if
i
don't
buy
your
argument
that
fire
resistant
pants
and
shirts
are
not
clothes,
where
would
you
propose
i
draw
the
line?
assume
i
say
you
are
wrong
with
if
it
looks
like
clothes,
it
is
clothes.
let's
apply
a
little
bit
of
common
sense
to
life.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
very
famous
saying.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
include
a
scuba
tank?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you
can
wear
anything
to
be
ready
for
work.
i
--
my
own
inclination
is
to
say
that
a
respirator
unit
on
your
back
is
not
clothes,
the
way
a
scuba
tank
isn't.
so
it
can't
be
just
something
that
covers
your
body.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
ready
for
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
why
didn't
--
why
wasn't
the
statute
written
that
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
wasn't
it
written
--
i
mean
they
use
very
specific
words,
“
changing
clothes
”.
that's
in
my
mind
narrower
than
your
definition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
definition
would
include
somebody
spending
an
hour
of
putting
on
a
suit
of
armor
if
he's
going
to
be
a
jouster.
it
would
include
the
space
people
who
put
on
that
complicated
white
suit
that
has
all
the
connections
to
equipment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
function
doesn't
matter,
then
how
do
we
define
“
clothes
”?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
function
covers
the
body.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
yang,
i
will
let
you
speak,
but
could
you
answer
justice
scalia's
question?
would
our
--
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
colleague's
broader
definition,
would
it
affect
a
preliminary
and
post-activity
definition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
difference?
isn't
this
what
some
courts
have
described
as
de
minimis
activity,
as
they
did
with
the
safety
glasses
and
the
hat
and
the
ear
plugs?
how
about
a
metal
apron?
some
meat
packers
only
do
a
metal
apron.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
actually,
that's
what
we
are
looking
for,
so
why
don't
you?
[laughter]
