our
second
case
is
case
12-417,
sandifer
v.
united
states
steel.
mr.
schnapper?
chief

john
g.
roberts,

counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
began
with
the
assumption
that
the
unions
are
on
your
side.
is
the
united
steelworkers
of
america
on
your
side?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
does
seem
to
support
to
notion
that
this
is
something
that
should
be
left
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the
point
would
be
that
the
steelworkers
gave
up
something
when
--
you
know,
it's
part
of
a
bargain.
okay?
if
they
say,
all
right,
we're
not
going
to
count
this
time,
but,
you
know,
you've
got
to
give
us
ten
more
cents
an
hour
or,
you
know,
greater
cafeteria
facilities
or
something.
it's
a
normal
part
of
the
bargaining
process.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they're
willing
to
give
it
up
to
get
something
else,
what's
--
what's
the
benefit
to
them
of
saying
you
can't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
whole
approach
here
--
you
are
saying
you
are
not
going
to
give
us
a
test,
you
are
just
going
to
criticize--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--their
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
heavy
duty
pants,
you
know,
blue
jeans
that
somebody
--
the
thick
ones
that
you
use
because
the
work
environment
will
involve,
you
know,
grease
and
hot
things
and
all,
but
that
you
wouldn't
necessarily
or
a
particular
worker
wouldn't
wear
off
the
steel
mill
site?
is
that
clothing
designed
to
protect
against
work
hazards
or
is
it
--
some
people
would
wear
that
outside
the
steel
plant,
other
people
wouldn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
yes,
but
there
are
heavier-duty
blue
jeans
that
are
made
out
of
a
particular
fabric
that
you
would
see
commonly
in
the
steel
mill,
but
you
maybe
wouldn't
see
commonly
outside.
