mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
government
that
not
everything
an
individual
wears
is
clothes.
we
disagree
with
the
government
as
to
the
appropriate
standard
for
distinguishing
things
that
are
and
are
not
clothes
under
section
203(o).
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
area
we're
--
in
which
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
government,
although
not
with
respondent.
in
ordinary
parlance,
not
everything
an
individual
wears
would
be
referred
to
as
clothes.
there
are
examples
of
that
in
this
courtroom:
glasses,
necklaces,
earrings,
wristwatches.
there
may
be
a
toupee
for
all
we
know.
those
things
are
not
commonly
referred
to
as
clothes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
nor
are
neck
braces,
which
i've
seen
one
in
this
courtroom.
it's
also
the
case
that
there
are
any
number
of
things
that
people
wear
to
do
their
jobs
that
are
not
clothes.
the
police
officers
outside
the
building
are
wearing
guns,
radios.
i
suspect
they
have
handcuffs;
i
couldn't
see
those.
the
quarterback
who
played
for
your
team
yesterday
had
a
quarterback
playbook
wristband
with
the
plays
on
--
on
his
--
on
his
wrist.
workers
wear
tool
belts.
it's
--
one
of
the
recurring
--
recurring
issues
that
has
come
up
in
these
cases
are
knife
scabbards.
we
don't
think
anyone
would,
in
ordinary
parlance,
call
those
things
clothes.
and
we
think
that's
the
significant
limitation
on
this.
the
--
the
company's
account
of
this
is
that
everything
that
you
wear
to
do
your
job
is
--
is
clothes
and
we
think
that's
just
not
consistent
with
ordinary
language.
and
although
the
government's
views
have,
to
some
extent,
evolved
over
time
in
all
of
this,
they've
always
taken
the
position
that
not
everything
you
wear
are
clothes.
even
in
its
--
in
the
2002
opinion
letter,
they
drew
the
line
at
tools
and
scabbards.
and
so
even
though
you
could
be
wearing
those
things,
those
are
not
clothes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
scabbards.
mr.
eric
schnapper
knife
scabbards.
the
tenth
circuit
holds
a
knife
scabbard
as
clothes
because
it's
like
holsters.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
i
think
that
your
question
raises
an
excellent
point.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
picture
is
that
it
withholds
from
you
other
information
that
you
would
use
to
assess
whether
to
describe
it
as
clothes.
you
don't
know
what--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--if
you
saw
an
airbag
jacket,
you
would
probably
call
it
clothes
unless
you
are
an
equestrian.
it
looks
like
a
jacket.
if
you
saw
a
compression
torsion
--
a
torso
compression
bandage
in
a
photograph,
you
would
call
it
clothes,
because
you
don't
have
all
the
relevant
information.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
our
view
--
well,
let
me
--
part
of
it
--
first
of
all,
they
are
designed
for
a
protective
function,
to
protect
you
from
catching
fire.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
your
honor.
we've
been
--
we've
tried
to
be
quite
specific
about
that.
we
distinguish
between
items
that
are
designed
and
worn
to
protect
from
a
workplace
hazard.
and
the
court
of
appeals
argued
that
everything
is,
in
a
sense,
protective.
that
is
not
the
standard
that
we
propose.
workplace
hazards
are
different.
and
in
ordinary
usage,
when
things
are
being
used
for
that
kind
of
protection,
they
are
typically
described
in
other
terms.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
it's
designed
to
provide
that
kind
of
protection.
let
me
explain
why
--
why
we've
added
that.
there
are
some
instances
in
which
one
would
wear
ordinary
clothing
on
the
job,
things
that
are
no
different
from
what
you
would
buy
at
j.c.
penney's,
because
it
was
to
some
degree
protective
from
a
workplace
hazard.
that's
true
here.
whatever
else
you
are
wearing,
underneath
it
you
have
to
wear
cotton
or
wool.
you
can't
wear--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
don't
think
in
ordinary
parlance
they
would
be
called
a
workplace
hazard.
i
mean,
that's
just
--
that's
just
the
normal
vicissitudes
of
life.
but
to
give
you
an
example
of--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
submit
--
i
think
that
--
that
you
would
be
wearing
a
parka
in
a
freezer
just
because
it
was
warmer.
i
mean,
if
you
stayed
there
all
day,
it
would
be
dangerous.
dangerous
cold
is
the
south
pole.
the
south
pole
is
a
hazard.
there
will
be
times
when
the
weather
forecast
will
be
it's
so
cold
that
it's
dangerous
to
go
outside.
and
i
think
it's
that
degree
of--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
you
put
on
more
than
a
parka.
i
think
that's
the
point--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--there's
a
whole
lot
of
stuff
that
i'm
sure
he
puts
on.
mr.
eric
schnapper
there
would
come
a
point
where
i
think
people
would
call
it
a
hazard
in
ordinary
english.
mr.
eric
schnapper
but
those
are
not
the
cases
that
come
up.
i
mean,
we
have
given
you
in
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
a
list
of
all
the
cases
in
the
last
20
years
that
we
could
find
involving
203.
that's
not
what
actually
happens.
i
mean,
we
are
trying
to
give
you
something
that
makes
sense
of
what's
going
on.
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
involve
things
everyone
would
call
a
hazard
--
knives,
molten
metal,
acids.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'm
not
entirely
sure
where
--
what
we
would
fall
back
to.
let
me
respond
to
that
question,
though,
the
premise
of
it
a
little
bit.
there
is
an
old
saying
that
if
it
looks
like
a
duck
and
it
swims
like
a
duck
and
it
quacks
like
a
duck,
it's
a
duck.
mr.
eric
schnapper
right,
right.
there's
--
but
part
of
the
takeaway
from
that
is
whether
you
call
something
a
duck
depends
on
all
the
information
you
have.
let
me
change
--
let
me
change
it
a
little
bit.
it
looks
like
a
duck,
it's
floating
there
in
the
water,
there
is
a
quacking
sound
and
there
are
some
men
in
a
shed
wearing
camouflage
gear
and
guns;
it's
probably
not
a
duck.
and
yet,
if
you
took
a
picture
of
just
the
duck--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
they
are
wearing
camouflage
and
holding
guns.
mr.
eric
schnapper
holding.
i
certainly
misspoke.
[laughter]
i
certainly
--
but
our
point
is
whether
--
how
you
characterize
something
depends
on
all
the
information.
now,
you
may
want
to
--
you
may
want
to
conclude,
although
i
think
it
may
be
wrong,
that
even
when
you
have
all
the
information,
even
if
you
understand
that
this
is
protective
in
nature,
you
understand
that
it
has
to
be
worn
because
of
very
severe
dangers,
you
understand
that
the
person
is
wearing
a
hood
over
his
head
not
because
it's
cold,
but
because,
although
it's
probably
100
degrees
where
he
is
working,
he
is
in
danger
of
being
burned
if
he
doesn't
wear
it.
if
after
that,
you
call
it
clothes,
i
disagree
with
you.
but
i
think
that's
at
least
the
right
way
to
analyze
it.
but
to
say
a
picture
looks
like
clothes
is
to
ask
how
we
would
characterize
something
if
we
didn't
have
all
the
information.
that
is
certainly
inappropriate.
you
have
to
assess
it
with
all
the
other
things
that
you
know
and
in
the
full
context.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
am
delighted
to
answer
that
question.
it
raises
a
number
of
issues,
some
of
them
having
to
do
with
the
way
the
statute
operates
today,
some
of
them
historical.
let
me
start
with
the
way
the
statute
operates
today.
you
said,
paraphrasing,
all
they
have
to
do
is
not
put
something
in
the
agreement
and
then
they
have
to
be
paid.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says
and
it's
not
the
way
it
works.
the
statute
says
in
the
agreement
or
a
custom
under
the
agreement.
the
lower
courts,
as
we've
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
have
taken
the
position
that
what
that
means
is
if
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
it
doesn't
expressly
require
that
they
be
paid
for
the
stuff,
then
not
paying
for
it
is
a
custom
under
the
contract.
and
so
what
actually
happens
is,
in
this
negotiation,
and
that
is
described
in
one
of
these
cases,
the
gear
changes
over
time.
an
employer
comes
in
and
says,
i
want
you
to
wear
some
additional
gear.
the
union
objects,
and
says,
that's
wrong,
we
ought
to
be
paid
for
it.
they
don't
succeed
in
negotiating--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it
goes
the
other
way.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
the
way
the
statute
works
now,
and
that
explains
--
it's
part
of
the
reason
why
they
are
there.
but
there's
something
broader
and
this
will
take
a
minute,
but
the
historical
context
is
uniquely
important
to
understanding
why
there
was
opposition
to
this
at
the
time.
it's
sort
of
a
three-act
play,
so
bear
with
me.
the
first
has
to
do
with
the
three
lawsuits
that
lead
to
the
portal
to
portal
act.
those
are
lawsuits
between
employers
and
unions.
the
cio
at
this
point
in
time
was
advancing
the
rights
of
workers
and
interests
of
workers
in
two
ways:
a,
in
negotiations;
and
b,
if
they
couldn't
get
something
in
negotiations
but
they
thought
it
was
required
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
then
they
would
sue,
or
they
would
take
the
position
in
negotiations
that
you
have
to
be
provided.
there
is
a
1991
buffalo
law
review
article
that
describes
this
history.
in
one
of
those
cases
the
union
actually
struck
unsuccessfully
for
this
and
then
proceeded
on
a
legal
track.
so
that
was
what
the
cio
was
doing.
they
wanted
both.
they
wanted
both
the
statute
and
negotiation
in
the
house
version
of
the
portal
to
portal
act,
section
3
effectively
banned
that.
section
3
said
if
this
--
if
something's
going
on,
and
it's
a
company
practice,
and
it
doesn't
violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it's
legal.
it
grandfathered
--
and
this
was
the
cio
objective
to
this.
and
this
was
not
adopted.
it
grandfathered
in
all
existing
violations.
indeed,
it
--
it
prospectively
grandfathered
things
in,
because
if
they
would
adopt
a
new
practice,
it
would
be
illegal.
and
the
example
that
the
cio
gave
was
to
pose
it
was
the
practice
of
the
employer
to
turn
back
the
clock
an
hour
every
day.
and
that
would
have
been
--
that
would
have
been
permitted.
so
the
senate
rejected
that,
and
it
didn't
end
up
in
the
bill.
now,
what
happens
is
this
comes
back
in
another
version
in
1949
with
a
very
different
congress.
and
--
and
my
brother
has
referenced
the
--
a
comment
--
it's
buried
in
the
long
statement
by
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
--
essentially
asking
for
the
--
this
old
language.
they
did
it
a
little
bit
differently.
it
--
it
--
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
assume
congress
just
picked
up
the
work
of
the
last
congress
in
--
in
'49
and
said,
oh,
well,
we
didn't
--
all
we
were
trying
to
accomplish
didn't
get
accomplished,
so
let's
work
on
it
some
more.
the
'48
elections
had
completely
changed
congress.
as
you
may
recall,
dewey
did
not
win
that
election.
the
republicans
lost
the
house.
they
lost
the
senate.
the
sponsor
of
the
house
bill
was
defeated,
and
the
new
members
of
the
house
and
senate
included
hubert
humphrey
and
gene
mccarthy
and
a
very
different
group
of
people.
they
were
not
there
to
further
the
--
the
agenda
of
the
last
congress.
the
herder
amendment
was
a
somewhat
--
the
--
not
what
was
adoptable
--
what
was
proposed
was
a
version
of
this.
it
said
anything
about
the
length
of
the
workday
is
--
is
legal
if
it's
in
a
contract
or
in
a
custom
or
practice
under
a
contract.
it
doesn't
--
didn't
--
we
know
from
experience
that
custom
or
practice
under
a
contract
works
to
grandfather
things,
old
things
and
new
things.
went
over
to
the
senate
and
the
senate
rejected
that
and
then
ended
up
with
this
narrowly
drawn
provision.
mr.
eric
schnapper
sorry
that's
so
long,
but
that's
why.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
they
have
not
filed.
they
--
they
agreed
in
the
last
collective
bargaining
agreement
not
--
not
to
file.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
it's
not
being
--
the
view
of
--
of
the
opponents
of
this
kind
of
proposal,
which
was
defeated
repeatedly
directed,
was
it
isn't
being
let
--
you're
--
you're
essentially
carving
unionized
plants
out
of
the
protections
of
the
statutes.
you're
stripping
the
workers
of
their
statutory
rights
and
saying
to
a
union,
if
you
can
negotiate
for
something,
that's
fine,
but
the
--
but
the
statute--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--if
i
--
again,
if
i
might
return
to
the
first
part
of
my
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
the
way
this
ordinarily
works,
and
it's
reflective
in
cases
we've
described
in
our
yellow
brief,
is
that
the
company's
position
is
this
is
--
we
don't
need
your
permission
to
do
this.
and
--
and
that's
true
--
that's
true
in
one
sense,
which
is
if
it's
not
committed
--
unless
the
contract
bans
it,
it
becomes
a
de
facto
practice
and
it's
legal.
but
it's
also
usually
the
company's
position
that
--
that
the
union
is
wrong
about
the
meaning
of
fair
labor
standards
act.
there's
a
dispute
in
this
case
on
the
part
of
the
company
as
to
whether
this
is
a
principal
activity.
they've
argued
it's
--
so
this
is
an
issue
about
which
people
bargain
the
way
they
would
bargain
about
an
extra
holiday.
but
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
union
walks
in,
is
entitled
to
this,
and
trades
it
for
something.
that
simply
isn't
what's
going
on.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
company's
position
is
it's
--
it's
not
something
that
they're
entitled
to.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
--
i
understand
--
i
understand
the
question.
but
the
union
can
go
in
and
say,
we
think
we're
entitled
to
this
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
the
company
would
say,
no,
we
don't.
and
then
if
they
can't
get
it,
it--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--okay.
our
answer
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
statute
says
“
clothes
”,
it
doesn't
say
“
anything
you
wear
”.
and
we
agree
with
the
government
that
there
are
things
you
could
put
on
that
would
not
be
clothes
and
that
you'd
have
to
be
paid
for.
and
we
--
i
think
we
disagree
with
the
government
about
what
those
are.
but
there's
--
but
--
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
most
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
there
are
things
you
put
on
that
are
not
clothes.
so
the
statute
distinguishes
between
clothes
and
other
things.
we
have
to
figure
out
what
that
distinction
means.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
ordinary
parlance,
whether
you're
going
to
call
something
clothes
or
not
depends,
as
the
government
says
at
page
25
of
its
brief,
on
both
its
form
and
its
function.
and
there's
a
continuum
of
things,
and
you
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere.
mr.
eric
schnapper
all
right.
your
honor
--
well,
your
honor,
we
are
not
undertaking
to
give
you
a
comprehensive
definition
of
what
items
are
and
aren't
clothes.
the
--
the
variety
of
things
people
wear
is
--
is
extraordinarily
complicated,
and
we
--
we
have
not
taken
that
on.
what
we
have
tried
to
do
is
suggest--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
we
may
disagree
of
the
substance,
but--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--all
--
all
we're
asking
the
court
to
hold
is
that
certain
things
are
not
clothes.
we're
not
undertaking
to
sort
out
among
the
things
that
hunters
wear,
where
you
would
draw
the
line.
i
mean,
ordinary
--
ordinary
parlance
is
--
is
complicated.
but
we
think
--
look,
it's
certainly
the
case,
we
believe,
that
not
everything
people
wear
is
clothes.
and
the
problem
is
to
fashion
a
standard.
we
think
the
government
standard
simply
doesn't
work,
and
it
doesn't
work
for
two
reasons.
their
standard,
as
we
understand
it
--
and
my
brother
will
address
this
in
further
detail
--
is
that
the
court
should
distinguish
between
clothes
on
the
one
hand
and
equipment,
devices,
and
tools
on
the
other.
now,
we
think
this
doesn't
work
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
--
the
distinction
isn't
clear.
in
footnote
6,
they
note
the
lower
courts
have
been
divided
about
gloves,
and
then
say
they
--
they
think
gloves
are
clothes.
they
don't
explain
it.
they
note
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
divided
about
leather
aprons.
at
page
24
and
25,
they
describe
labor
board
decisions
and
some
other
things
which
--
which
have
characterized
certain
items
as--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no.
our
test
is
an
item
is
not
clothes
if
it
is
worn
to
protect
against
a
workplace
hazard
and
was
designed
to
protect
against
hazards.
and
--
but
if
i
might
just
finish
my
point,
the
government
standard
is
--
it's
not
clear
how
they
have
gotten
where
they
did.
there
are
divisions
about
a
number
of
different
things.
and
then
what
they
describe
as
on
the
not-clothes
side
of
the
line
on
pages
24
and
25
sound
a
lot
like
what
people
are
wearing
here.
in
addition,
casting
it
as
the
government
has
forces
the
lower
courts
to
decide
what
are
equipment,
tools
and
devices
because
anything
that
is
not
an
equipment,
tool,
or
device
would
end
up
being
clothes.
and
that
simply
recasts
the
question
about
a
--
some
words
that
are
not
in
the
statute.
the
words
that
is
somewhat
broader
and
doesn't
trigger
all
of
this
is
gear.
and
if
i
might
say
one
or
two
things
about
it.
but
court
--
the
government
used
the
word
“
gear
”
in
its
1997,
2001,
2002
and
2010
opinion
letters,
although
they
take
different
substantive
positions.
they
quote
the
word
“
equipment
”
from
this
court's
decision
in
alvarez,
and
the
word
“
equipment
”
is
there
twice,
but
the
word
“
gear
”
is
used
28
times.
and
a
month
ago
when
i
was
here
and
the
construction
was
still
going
on
outside,
there
was
a
sign
outside,
and
it
depicted
a
worker
with
an
arrow
pointing
to
and
labelling
his
hardhat,
his
goggles,
his
work
gloves,
and
his
boots,
and
it
said
"do
not
enter
without
proper
gear.
"
so--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--certainly,
people
wear
blue
jeans
under
all
sorts
of
circumstances.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
--
if
there
was
something
identifiable
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
mill
that
was
--
that
was
a
hazard,
that
might
fall
there.
but
we
have
also
taken
the
position,
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
these
particular
kinds
of
clothes,
items,
that
things
that
you
would
wear
for
--
that
weren't
designed
to
deal
with
hazards
wouldn't
be
--
wouldn't
be
in
our
carveout.
thank
you
very
much.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'd
like
to
address
a
number
of
questions
that
were
asked
earlier
and
then
to
respond
to
a
point
my
brother
made.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
justice
breyer,
it
is
the
experience
of
the
united
food
and
commercial
workers
that
the
position
companies
take
with
regard
to
this
--
these
items
is
simply
another
bargainable
unit
--
item,
like
a
holiday.
it
is
not
treated
by
them
as
something
unions
are
entitled
to.
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
why
it
matters
here
and
whether
the
items
--
how
we
characterize
the
items
about
which
the
government
would
disagree
with
the
company,
at
least
in
isolation.
and
it
matters
for
two
reasons
that
have
to
do
with
the
broader
context
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
first,
as
we
explained
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
an
unchallenged
rule
that
--
that
an
employer
has
to
pay
a
worker
for
carrying
tools
or
other
things
needed
to
do
the
job
to
the
--
the
work
station.
if
anything
in
this
list
isn't
clothes
and
the
workers
have
to
have
it
at
the
work
station,
it
would
presumptively
fall
within
the
tool-carrying
rule.
so
it's
very
important
to
the
company
in
this
case
that
all
of
it
be
clothes.
it's
also
important
under
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
its
brief
in
tum,
which
was
a
companion
case
to
alvarez.
the
government's
position,
with
which
we
agree,
is
that
once
there
is
any
non-203(o)
exempt
item,
it
starts
the
calculation
of
the
de
minimis
time,
which
then
includes
not
only
the
time
for
that
item,
but
the
travel
time
that
follows.
it
starts
the
de
minimis
clock.
if
that's
right,
then
if
anything
in
this
case
isn't
203(o)
exempt,
the
company
would
have
to
change
its
practice.
justice
kagan,
you
asked
more
broadly
why
the
test
matters.
and
i
think
the
government
was
moving
in
this
direction.
there
is
generally
few,
if
any,
cases
involving
poultry
or
poultry
processing
in
which
there's
stuff
that
would
--
would
meet
the,
well,
if
i
had
a
photograph
of
it,
it
looks
like
clothes
test.
it's
almost
all
gear.
and
so
in
that
industry,
it's
of
enormous
importance
the
difference
between
the
government's
position
in
its
--
at
least
in
its
brief
and
the
company's
position.
that
has
great
implications
for
those
--
those
plants.
finally,
if
i
might
respond
to
a
point
that
the
government
made.
the
government
has
introduced
another
concept,
i
think,
that's
not
set
forth
in
our
brief
but
i
want
to
address,
and
that's
that
in
addition
to
the
process
that
would
go
on,
on
any
of
our
standards
of
separating
out
what
things
are
clothes
and
what
things
are
not
clothes,
the
government
would
then
overlay
that
with
an
ancillary
test.
and
if
it's
predominantly
clothes,
then
the
whole
thing
counts
as
clothes;
if
it's
predominantly
non-clothes,
it
goes
the
other
way.
i
don't
know.
i
think
that's
another
area
of
uncertainty
you
shouldn't
inflict
on
the
lower
courts
and
it's
not
consistent
with
the
statute.
the
statute
doesn't
say
changing
clothes
and
ancillary
stuff.
i'd
agree
about
opening
the
locker.
it's
--
it's
necessary
to
change
your
clothes.
but
when
you
start
taking
things
which,
the
government
would
agree,
by
themselves
aren't
clothes,
and
say,
well,
this
--
this
falls
within
changing
clothes
even
though
it's
not
clothes
because
it's
sort
of
happening
at
the
same
time,
seems
to
me
you're
opening
up
another
can
of
worms
that
should
stay
closed.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
believe
about
60
percent
are
and
the
rest
are
not.
the
poultry
industry
filed
a
brief.
mr.
eric
schnapper
generally
not.
the
--
the
unions
have
not
been
able
to
negotiate
that.
it's
the
arrangement
that
--
that
i've
just
described.
and
--
and,
of
course,
there
are
a
large
number
of
nonunionized
plants,
they
have
to
pay
for
all
this.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
