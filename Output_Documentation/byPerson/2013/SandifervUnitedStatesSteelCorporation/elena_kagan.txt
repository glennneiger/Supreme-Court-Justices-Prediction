justice
elena
kagan
--but
i
thought
that
your
distinction
was
well,
there
are
two
sets
of
clothes,
to
use
a
better
word.
there
are
two
sets
of
clothes
and
they
both
look
like
clothes,
but
one
is
for
protective
--
a
protective
function,
and
one
is
for
a
sanitary
function.
and
that's
the
distinction
that
you
want
to
draw.
and
i
guess
another
way
of
saying
justice
ginsburg's
question
is:
why
should
we
look
at
a
word
that
just
says
“
clothes
”
and
make
that
distinction
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
changing
clothing
is,
whether
it's
for
sanitary
reasons
or
whether
it's
for
protective
reasons
or
whether
it's
because
people
want
doormen
to
look
nice?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
would
it
matter?
could
you
give
a
few
examples
of
when
it
would
make
a
difference,
the
--
the
difference
between
your
test
and
the
government's
test?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
like
what,
that's
not
de
minimis?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
it
just
seems
that
in
most
of
these
cases,
everybody
is
just
going
to
say
it
takes
two
seconds
to
put
on
a
pair
of
eyeglasses.
so
i
guess
i'm
--
i'm
struggling
with
why
you
and
the
government
are
fighting
so
hard
about
the
proper
test.
justice
elena
kagan
so
then
what
does
separate
you
from
mr.
dinardo?
now
you're
sounding
exactly
the
same.
justice
elena
kagan
like
what?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
schnapper
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
happen
to
know
why
the
government
hasn't
issued
a
regulation
on
this?
it
seems
the
quintessential
question
of
statutory
interpretation
to
which
we
would
normally
defer
to
the
agency.
why
hasn't
--
this
is
really
a
question
to
mr.
yang,
but
do
you
just
happen
to
know,
given
the
history
of
all
this
and
all
this
--
these
guidance
documents,
why
they've
never
just
like
come
to
everybody's
aid
and
issued
a
regulation?
