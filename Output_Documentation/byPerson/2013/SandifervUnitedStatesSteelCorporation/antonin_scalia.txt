justice
antonin
scalia
i
resent
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
tools
and
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
scabbards.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
lived
in
chicago
when
it
never
got
above
zero
for
two
weeks.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
to
say
they
are
“
wearing
guns
”
in
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
holding
guns.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
but
common
usage
doesn't
separate
from
the
meaning
of
clothes
only
those
--
those
protective
garments
that
are
required
by
the
occupation,
that
are
required
by
the
employer.
that's
a
--
that's
a
very
strange
definition
of
clothes.
hunters,
when
--
when
they're
hunting
birds
wear
--
wear
trousers
that
are
brush-proof.
they,
you
know,
resist
briars
and
other
things.
those
are
protective.
and
those
--
those
pants
wouldn't
be
worn
elsewhere.
now,
i
can
understand
you're
arguing
those
are
not
clothes
because
they
perform
a
protective
function
other
than
heat
and
cold.
but
you're
--
you're
proposing
a
very
odd
definition
of
clothes.
it
excludes
only
those
protective
garments
that
are
protection
against
workplace
hazards.
that's
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you
have
taken
it
on.
you're
trying
to
tell
us
what
is
the
ordinary
meaning
of
clothes.
that's
what
you're
appealing
to,
the
ordinary
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suggest
the
ordinary
meaning
is
not
--
is
not
what
you
--
you
have
proposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
includes
protective
garments,
and
--
and
you
want
it
to
include
all
protective
garments,
i
guess,
except
those
that
protect
against
workplace
hazards.
that's
peculiar.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
--
i
think
the
government
is
--
you
and
the
government
are
fighting
simply
because
the
government
is
being
principled.
the
word
of
the
statute
is
“
clothes
”.
and
nobody
would
consider
eyeglasses
or
a
wristwatch
or
some
of
this
other
specialized
equipment
to
be
clothes.
i
mean,
the
word
is
what
it
is.
and
--
and
i
mean,
it's
wonderful
to
say,
we
can
eliminate
all
the
problems
by,
you
know,
saying
everything
is
clothes,
you
know.
everything,
no
matter
what,
wristwatch,
eyeglasses.
well,
yes,
it
makes
a
--
a
lovely
world.
but
it
does
not
adhere
to
the
words
of
the
statute
which
says
“
clothes
”.
doesn't
that
mean
anything?
everything
is
clothes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it
doesn't
matter,
why
make
a
liar
out
of
us?
you
know,
why
--
why
make
us
say
something
that
--
that
everybody
knows
is
not
true,
that
everything
you
put
on
is
clothes.
justice
antonin
scalia
earrings,
eyeglasses,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
cannot
get
that
very
precise
limitation
out
of
the
word
“
clothes
”.
you
just
can't.
and
say
it's
protective
gear
for
work,
it's
not
other
protective
gear.
okay?
it's
only
those
earrings
you
have
to
wear
for
work,
otherwise,
earrings
are
not
clothes.
ah,
but
if
they're
required
for
work,
they
become
clothes.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
no
non-unionized
employers
that
--
that
have
to
confront
this
problem,
and
they
have
to
pay
--
they
have
to
pay
for
work
time,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
everybody
else
has
to
pay
for
the
changing
time,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is,
so
you
--
so
you
have
the
same
issue
there,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
the
union
cannot
pull
your
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
say
it's
incidental
instead
of
de
minimis.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what's
the
consequence
of
calling
it
incidental?
justice
antonin
scalia
too
complicated
is
why.
[laughter]
