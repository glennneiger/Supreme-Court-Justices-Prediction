mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
203(o),
the
portal
to
portal
act
had
already
relieved
employers
of
the
obligation
to
pay
for
changing
into
or
out
of
ordinary
clothing.
there
is
little
question
that
203(o)
was
directed
at
the
sort
of
clothing
that,
absent
203(o),
could
be
deemed
to
be
a
principal
activity,
the
changing
into
or
out
of
clothing
that
was
not
already
excluded
by
the
preliminary
and
postliminary
exclusion
in
the
portal
to
portal
act.
congress
referred
in
203(o)
to
time
spent
changing
clothes,
to
time
spent
changing
clothes
that
is
excluded
from
the
workday
pursuant
to
an
agreement,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
in
the
context
of
an
agreement
with
the
labor
organization
that
the
time
would
be
excluded.
collective
bargaining
takes
place
around
activities
and
determines
how
certain
activities
are
to
be
treated.
collective
bargaining
does
not
focus
on
whether
or
not
a
shirt
is
clothes
or
a
pair
of
pants
are
clothes
or
protective
eye
gear,
and
that
is
how
the
statute
was
written.
given
those
two
points,
the
term
“
clothes
”
as
used
in
the
statute
was
intended
to
encompass
the
work
outfit
industrial
workers
were
required
to
change
into
and
out
of
to
be
ready
for
work.
that's
the
logical
conclusion
of--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--if
the
labor--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--if
the
labor
organization
and
the
employer,
for
whatever
odd
reason,
would
decide
that
part
of
the
outfit
you
need
to
be
ready
to
go
to
work
included
the
tank
--
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
because
it
would
make
more
sense
to
put
the
tank
on
when
you
get
to
the
location
where
you
are
going
to
perform
your
principal
activities.
but
were
they
to
do
that,
that's
what
this
statute
empowered
them
to
do.
and
in
terms
of
custom
or
practice,
i
should
mention
this--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--it
wasn't
written
that
way--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--well,
your
honor,
they
use
those
words
with
other
words
when
they
say
"any
time
spent
in
changing
clothes.
"
that
the
labor
organization
and
the
employer
agree
shall
be
excluded.
they
don't
say
it
in
the
abstract.
it
is
pursuant
to
an
agreement.
and
a
custom
or
practice,
and
case
law
will
bear
this
out,
is
an
agreement.
it
is
not
unilateral
action,
your
honor.
it
is
by
either
very
open
acquiescence
or
long-term
acquiescence--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--so
for
the
first
part
of
the
question,
the
notion
of
custom
or
practice
is
a
notion
of
agreement
or,
at
the
very
least,
long-time
acquiescence.
if
a
union
is
not
able
to
get
a
provision
in
a
labor
contract
that
satisfies
it
on
this
subject,
it
seem
--
it
simply
needs
to
object
to
the
nonpayment.
and
then
the
question
becomes,
is
this
clothes
changing
preliminary
or
postliminary
under
the
portal
act
and
therefore
not
work,
or
is
this
a
principal
activity
that
absent
an
agreement
under
section
203(o)
is
work
and
must
be
paid?
the
notion
that
custom
or
practice
is
something
that
an
employer
can
unilaterally
adopt
is
simply
false.
it
--
there
must
be
the
union's
agreement,
either
expressly,
as
there
has
been
for
60
years
in
this
labor
contract
between
the
steel
workers
and
u.s.
steel,
that
this
entire
block
of
time
will
be
excluded,
or
a
union
must
say
by
its
silence
or,
absent
an
agreement,
a
formal
agreement,
but
its
verbal
agreement,
this
is
acceptable
to
us,
we
need
not
be
paid
for
this
beginning-of-the-day
block
of
time.
and
our
suggestion
that
the
test
ought
to
be
what
these
parties
agree
will
be
part
of
the
work
outfit
that
will
start
the
day
is,
in
large
measure,
a
recognition
of
the
way
collective
bargaining
operates.
a
labor
union
and
an
employer
don't
say,
should
there
be
pay
for
putting
the
hat
on
or
putting
the
jacket
on?
the
discussion
surrounds:
what
do
we
do
about
this
10
minutes
or
5
minutes
or
3
minutes
or
15
minutes
that
precedes
active,
productive
work?
do
we
include
that
activity?
now,
granted,
your
honor,
they
said
any
time
spent
in
changing
clothes
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
that
was
the
nature
of
the
debate
that
preceded
the
1949
amendment.
the
department
of
labor
said
perhaps
some
clothes
changing
is
not
preliminary
or
postliminary.
perhaps
it
is
a
principal
activity.
they
started
the
discussion
around
clothes
changing,
but
the
industrial
practice
that
was
being
debated
was
this
beginning-of-the-day
activity,
the
locker
room
activity
of
getting
yourself
invested
in
the
outfit
you
need
to
wear
to
be
ready
for
work.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
so
in
our
particular
case,
your
honor,
this
does
not
matter.
the
--
the
items,
the
hard
hat,
the
earplugs,
the
protective
eye
gear
and
the
respirator
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
--
the
lower
court
said
the
time
is
de
minimis,
and
it
doesn't
matter.
clearly,
the
items
here
are
clothes,
the
government
agrees
they're
clothes.
they're
clothes
by
any
measure,
by
any
test.
but
on
a
going-forward
basis,
this
notion
that
there
is
a
dichotomy
between
clothes
and
equipment
is
a
problem.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
well,
it'll
make
a
difference,
your
honor,
in
--
in
all
of
those
circumstances
where
part
of
the
outfit
that
you
put
on
to
wear
to
be
ready
to
work
is
not
something
that
one
might,
absent
an
industrial
context,
look
at
and
say
intuitively,
that's
clothing.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
so,
for
--
for
example
--
well,
in
many
respects,
i
should
say,
these
sorts
of
items
are,
in
fact,
de
minimis.
it
takes
seconds
for
a
police
officer
to
put
a
--
a
vest
on
that
has
--
that's
made
of
kevlar,
for
example,
a
modern
fabric
that
can
protect
and
yet,
it's
specialized.
but
it's
a
matter
of
seconds.
but
that's
the
sort
of
argument
you
would
leave
the
lower
courts
to
deal
with.
is
--
is
that
vest,
one
might
call
it
equipment,
the
government
might,
we
don't
know,
or
they
might
call
it
clothing,
and
here's
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
that
in
a
definitive
sort
of
way.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
well,
again,
we're
not
fighting
that
hard
because
they
--
they
urge
affirmance.
but
the
proper
test
--
i
would
suggest
this:
as
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned,
is
this
clothing
or
equipment,
and
it
answered
its
own
question,
well,
really
it's
both.
the
problem
with
trying
that
dichotomy
is
you'll
leave
everyone
to
argue,
is
this
particular
item
quote
“
equipment
”?
so
is
--
is
the
--
is
the
worker
in
the
meat
factory's
chain-link
vest,
vest
or
shirt,
they
call
it
a
shirt,
but
it's
made
out
of
chain
link.
is
that
equipment
or
is
that
clothes?
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
it
--
it
does
mean
something,
but
it
must
be
read
as
part
of
any
time
spent--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--the
--
the
statute
is
activity
focused.
if
we
look
at--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
so
what
of
opening
your
locker?
opening
your
locker--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--yet,
the
time
is
excluded.
yet,
the
time
is
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
yes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
labor
organizations
and
employers
don't
negotiate
that
way.
they
don't
say,
we'll
pay
you
for
the
eyeglasses,
but
we
won't
for
the
shirt.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
unless
it's
in
the
collective--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--and
then
you
look
up
the
definition
of
clothes
and
it's
any
covering
for
the
human
body
and
it
includes
accessories.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
the
safety
glasses
that
go
over
the
eyeglasses
are,
in
fact,
designed
to
cover
the
--
part
of
the
face.
they
are
designed
to
cover
part
of
the
face.
if
we
leave--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--but
it's
not
everything
you
put
on.
it's
a
work
outfit.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
it
would
be
the
work
outfit
that
the
employer
and
the
union
agreed
you
need
to
have
on
your
person
to
be
ready
for
work.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
it's
--
it's
less
required
for
work
as
it
is
--
the
congress
was
after
allowing
this
block
of
time
to
be
dealt
with.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
and
it's
less
the
individual
nature
of
the
item
as
it
is
the
activity.
is
this
part
of
the
activity
of
changing
your
clothes?
and
if
part
of
the
activity
of
changing
your
clothes
is
taking
off
your
eyeglasses
and
putting
them
in
your
locker
and
putting
safety
glasses
on,
that
piece
of
time
is
covered
by
the
statute,
even
though,
in
reality,
the
union
wouldn't
bargain
over
that
piece
of
time.
they
would
argue
--
they
would
bargain
over,
what
shall
we
do
with
this
pre-shift
attire.
leaving
--
go
ahead,
madam--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--well,
i
would
suggest
--
i
would
suggest
that
what
it's
made
of
should
not
matter.
so
the
material
shouldn't
matter.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
the
function
shouldn't
matter.
in
terms
of
the
time--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--the
function
doesn't
matter
because--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--sometimes
it
could
be
for
protection;
sometimes
it
could
be
for
identification.
so
some
people
have
to
wear
certain
things
so
they're
identified.
other
people
have
to
wear
things
at
work
so
they
are
protected.
i
think
that
shouldn't
matter.
and
the
length
of
time,
frankly,
shouldn't
matter
because
the
agreement
must
be
bona
fide.
the
statute
has
a
protection
for
a
union
that
doesn't
extract
something
in
exchange
for
agreeing
that
this
increment
of
time
will
be
excluded.
the
--
the
statute
requires
that
the
labor
agreement
be
a
bona
fide
labor
agreement.
so
the
--
the
obligation
of
bargaining
and
--
and
fulfilling
your
obligation
of
fair
representation
is
built
into
the
statute.
i
believe
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
focus
on
an
item-by-item
investigation
of
these
issues
in
countless
numbers
of
these
cases
and
that
is
the
wrong
approach.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
so
i
would
say
this:
in
this
particular
case,
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
the
record's
replete
with
declarations,
the
most
common
event
is
a
worker
comes
to
his
locker,
takes
off
some
of
their
clothes.
they
have
to
--
they're
required
to
put
their
personal
long
underwear
shirt
on
and
long
underwear
pants
on,
then
the
gear
that's
in
the
--
the
gear
--
then
the
clothing
that's
in
the
picture,
that's
the
actual
events
in
this
case.
but
if
someone
were
to
come
in
and
--
in
their
long
underwear
and
not
have
to
take
their
outer
clothes
off
and
just
put
the
items
that
are
in
the
record
on,
then
the
question
becomes
have
they
changed
because
they
have
simply
layered.
i
would
say
this:
it's
not
the
most
common
use
of
the
term
“
changing
”,
but
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
definition
of
changing,
“
to
make
different
”.
i
think
it
would
happen
here.
so
it's
actually
not
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i
think
the
word
is
certainly
broad
enough
to
encompass.
and
lastly,
it
would
make
no
sense
in
the
statute
to
allow
the
personal
idiosyncrasies
of
those
people
coming
to
work,
someone
who
decides
to
layer
their
items
over
what
they
have
on,
someone
else
who
decides
to
take
them
off
before
they
layer.
i
would
say
that
reading
the
statute
as
an
activity-based
statute
is
consistent
as
well
with
the
notion
of
washing,
which
is
in
this
statute.
we
don't
think
of
turning
a
shower
on
necessarily
or
retrieving
a
towel
as
washing.
the
statute
excludes
time
spent
washing,
and
we
don't
try
to
drill
down
what
exactly
is
washing.
we
say
in
close
cases,
the
determining
factor
should
be
the
agreement
the
labor
organization
has
reached
with
the
employer.
leave
all
of
this
craziness
about
whether
a
particular
item
is
covered
or
not
covered
to
the
parties
closest
to
deal
with
it,
the
labor
organization,
and
the
employer,
who
have
had,
in
this
particular
case,
60
years
of
dealing
with
this.
if
you
say
to
a
worker
at
u.s.
steel,
“
go
change
your
clothes
”,
they
will
know
exactly
what
you
meant.
and
they
will
take
that
to
mean,
"put
my
hard
hat
on.
"
"put
my
protective
eyewear
on.
"
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
so
the
statute
only
covers
--
203(o)
only
applies
in
unionized
workplaces.
it's
only
where
a
labor
organization
and
an--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--unless
it's
preliminary
or
postliminary.
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
well,
yes
--
it's--
mr.
lawrence
c.
dinardo
--well,
of
course,
there
is
no
union
present,
so
the
question
becomes
is
it
preliminary
activity?
is
it
ordinary
clothes
changing
that's
not
a
principal
activity,
et
cetera?
there's
--
clearly
this
applies
in
unionized
workplaces.
there
is
a
representative
of
these
employees.
they
can
bargain
over
these
blocks
of
time,
over
these
activities,
and
determine
how
best
to
deal
--
how
best
to
deal
with
it.
thank
you.
