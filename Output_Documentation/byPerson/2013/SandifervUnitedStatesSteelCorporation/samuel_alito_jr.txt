justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
that
the
jacket
and
the
pants
in
that
picture
are
not
clothes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
one
of
the
aspects
of
your
argument
that
seems
really
puzzling
to
me.
i
don't
know
when
a
human
being
first
got
the
idea
of
putting
on
clothing.
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
main
reasons,
probably
the
main
reason,
was
for
protection.
it's
for
protection
against
the
cold,
it's
for
protection
against
the
sun.
it's
for
protection
against
--
against
thorns.
so
you
want
us
to
hold
that
items
that
are
worn
for
purposes
of
protection
are
not
clothing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
it
--
if
it
protects
against
something
other
than
workplace
hazard,
it
can
be
clothes.
but
if
it
protects
against
a
workplace
hazard,
it
isn't
clothing.
is
that
your
test?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
you
are
working
out
in
the
sun?
so
you
are
wearing
clothing
so
that
you
don't
get
burned
by
the
sun.
what
if
you
are
working
out
in
the
cold
and
you
wear
a
parka
so
that
you
don't
freeze
while
you're
working?
are
those
workplace
hazards?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
if
the
union
--
is
it
consistent
with
the
union's
duty
to
represent
your
client
for
them
to
bargain
away
something
to
which
your
clients
are
entitled
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
no,
the
union.
if
the
union--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
nothing
has
been
said
about
the
word
“
changing
”.
maybe
you
could
say
something
about
that.
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
awkward
to
refer
to
the
changing
of
clothes
when
all
that
the
person
is
doing
is
putting
on
clothing
on
top
of
clothing
that
the
person
is
already
wearing?
that's
not
the
way
the
term
is
normally
used,
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
you
just
said
--
what
you
just
said,
i
find
quite
confusing.
i
can
make
a
list
of
things
that
are
considered
to
be
clothing.
one
of
them
would
be
a
jacket
perhaps.
one
would
be
a
vest.
and
if
you
tell
me
that
a
vest
is
not
clothing
if
it's
made
out
of
metal,
then
i
don't
know
why
mr.
schnapper
is
not
right
that
a
jacket
is
not
a
jacket
if
it's
got
extra
flame
protection
--
protecting
chemicals
in
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
when
somebody
in
the
meat
packing
industry
puts
on
something
that
would
be
clothing
but
also
puts
on
all
these
other
things
that
you
say
are
not
clothing,
you
would
say
in
that
situation
putting
on
all
this
additional
stuff
is
not
ancillary,
and
that
is
for
what
reason?
because
it
takes
more
time
in
relation
to
the
clothing
or
the
number
of
non-clothing
items
exceeds
the
number
of
non-clothing
items?
what
does
that
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
practice
in
the
poultry
industry
to
which
you
referred?
are
those
unionized
workplaces
and
have
they
bargained
on
this
issue?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
under
--
where
they
have
collective
bargaining
agreements,
are
they
compensated
for
this
time
or
not?
