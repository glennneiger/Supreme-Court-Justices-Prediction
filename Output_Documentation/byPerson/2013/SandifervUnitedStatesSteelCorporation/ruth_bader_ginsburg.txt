but
we're
dealing
with
here,
from
the
picture,
that
looks
like
clothes
to
me.

mr.
schnapper,
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
we're
talking
about
time
and
whether
it
will
be
paid.
and
we
have
one
worker
that
puts
on
this
protective
garb.
and
then
we
have
another,
the
baker.
it
takes
them
about
the
same
amount
of
time
to
do
--
put
on
everything
he
has
to
put
on.
but
everybody
agrees,
he
doesn't
get
paid
for
that.
what
is
the
--
that
that
would
come
within
the
clothing.
so
we
have
all
kinds
of
people
who
have
to
wear
special
uniforms,
a
doorman
in
an
apartment
house.
it
takes
them
time
to
put
it
on.
why
should
there
be
a
distinction
in
getting
paid
between
the
protective
garb
and
something
that
you
must
wear
on
the
job?
that
--
yes.

mr.
dinardo,
in
this
case,
does
it
matter
if
we
take
your
position
that
anything
you
need
to
wear
to
be
ready
for
work
or
the
government's
position
--
and
i
think
it
was
the
seventh
circuit's
position,
too
--
that
equipment
is
different
from
clothes?
but
here
the
seventh
circuit
said
the
equipment
that's
involved,
hard
hats,
glasses,
earplugs,
respirator,
none
of
those
things
--
that
they
--
they
take
de
minimis
time,
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
them.
in
this
case,
will
it
make
a
difference
if
we
go
your
way
and
say,
everything
worn
counts;
or
the
government's
way
saying,
well,
that
these
clothes
count,
but
equipment
can
be
distinguished?
