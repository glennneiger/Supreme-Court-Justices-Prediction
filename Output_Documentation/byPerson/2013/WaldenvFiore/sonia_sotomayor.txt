justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
told
me
--
you
started
by
saying
that
our
personal
jurisdiction
and
venue
provisions
and
jurisprudence
center
on
a
defendant's
action,
not
on
the
plaintiff's
action
or
injury.
calder
suggests
otherwise.
but
how
do
you
respond,
not
only
to
justice
--
i'll
do
this
after,
but
let
me
just
pose
the
question
and
you
can
answer
it
on
your
rebuttal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
worried
about
the
internet
effects
from
somebody's
account
in
vermont
by
someone
in
illinois
--
the
hypothetical
on
page
19,
who
steals
something
from
a
store
in
california.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
imagine
a
case
where
everybody
agreed
that
the
initial
seizure
was
lawful,
so
that
that
wasn't
part
of
the
complaint
at
all,
and
the
only
complaint
was
that
a
false
affidavit
had
been
filed,
so
that
after
making
the
preliminary
investigation,
the
officer
hadn't
transferred
the
money,
but
had
instead
kept
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
wouldn't
know
how.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
write
a
--
counsel,
write
a
holding
that
takes
care
of
your
case
without
putting
at
risk
the
internet
cases
that
he's
talking
about.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
your
adversary
is
right.
we
write
rules
that
get
applied
to
different
concepts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
write
the
holding
for
me
that
can't
be
just
plaintiff
--
defendant's
activities,
because
calder
did
more
than
just
defendant's
activities.
so
write
a
different
--
write
the
holding.
