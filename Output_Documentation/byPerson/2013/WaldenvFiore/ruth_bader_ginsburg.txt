it's
not
likely,
is
it,
considering
if
the
bivens
claim
was
created
by
this
court
and
not
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
you
would
not
have
any
problem
about
--
assuming
we
agree
with
you
that
it's
--
there's
no
personal
jurisdiction,
it's
the
wrong
venue,
for
the
district
court
in
nevada
to
transfer
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court
in
georgia?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
they
say
they
were
residents
in
both
places,
in
both
california
and
nevada?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
--
it
was
stated
as
a
separate
claim,
and
i
think
judge
grisholm
read
it
that
way
and
i
don't
think
petitioner
has
taken
issue
with
that.
that
there's
--
one
claim
is
for
the
seizure,
another
claim
is
for
the
false
affidavit.
so
the
seizure
stops
the
funds
immediately
and
then
the
false
affidavit
keeps
them
there.
so
i
didn't
think
there
was
a
--
a
genuine
difference
between
the
parties
on
whether
the
affidavit
--
knowingly
composing
a
false
affidavit
is
an
independent
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
can
i
take
you
back
to
the
origins
of
all
of
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
main
move
for
personal
jurisdiction
traditionally
is
the
plaintiff
must
go
to
where
the
defendant
is,
no
matter
how
inconvenient
that
is
for
the
plaintiff.
jurisdiction
is
defendant-centered.
you're
trying
to
hold
a
defendant,
you
have
to
go
where
he
is.
then
the
long
arm
age
comes
about,
and
we
have
specific
jurisdiction,
which,
by
the
way,
is
what
you're
urging.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
still
not
saying
they
have
all-purpose
jurisdiction
over
walden.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
court,
as
the
mcentyre
decision
indicates,
has
been
pretty
careful
about
specific
jurisdiction.
and
miguel
wasn't
enough
that
machine
blew
up
or
cut
somebody's
fingers
in
new
jersey.
they
had
to
purposely
avail
themselves
of
wherever
the
--
the
standard
words
are.
and
here
you're
asking
for
--
really
pushing
this
specific
jurisdiction
to
the
limit.
the
defendant
has
acted
only
in
georgia.
he
hasn't
set
foot
outside
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
asking
the
court
to
decide
a
big
ticket
item,
personal
jurisdiction,
and
the
theory
that
you
are
proposing
would
apply
not
to,
just
to
officer
walden,
but
it
would
be
about
as
far
out
as
any
specific
jurisdiction
case
i
know.
so
the
court
shouldn't
say,
well,
jurisdiction
okay;
venue,
okay,
but
consider
it
transferring
it
to
georgia.
that
seems
to
me
wild.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
calder
have
something
to
do
with
the
notion
that
every
defamation
is
--
that
every
publication
is
a
tort
where
it
occurs?
there
is
something
special
about
the
libel
cases.
there
was
that
theory
that
wherever
the
paper
that
contains
the
libelous
article,
wherever
it
is
sent,
in
each
one
of
those
places
the
tort
occurs
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except,
mr.
goldstein--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
--
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
walden
whether
this
person
is
from
alaska
or
nevada.
in
calder,
the
article
was
about
a
person
in
california.
the
sources
came
from
california.
the
paper
had
its
principal
circulation
in
california.
it
seems
to
me
there's
nothing
resembling
that
in
this
case.
