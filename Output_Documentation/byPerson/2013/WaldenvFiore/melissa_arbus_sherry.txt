ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
start
with
this
court's
decision
in
calder,
because
the
facts
of
this
case
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
calder.
in
calder,
the
article
was
all
about
the
state
of
california.
it
was
about
the
california
activities
of
a
california
resident
whose
career
was
centered
in
california,
based
on
california
sources,
and
in
a
magazine
that
--
where
its
primary
publication
was
in
california.
here,
even
if
you
were
to
focus
just
on
the
affidavit,
the
affidavit
is
in
every
real
sense
focused
on
the
state
of
georgia.
according
to
respondents'
own
allegation,
it
recounts
what
happened
in
the
atlanta
airport
in
georgia.
it
was
based
on
information
that
was
received
by
officer
walden
in
georgia.
it's
about
funds
that
were
seized
in
georgia,
that
remained
in
georgia.
it
was
prepared
in
georgia,
forwarded
to
an
ausa
in
georgia
for
forfeiture
proceedings
in
georgia.
and
so
the
two
cases
could
not
be
more
different.
just
as
the
focal
point
of
the
tortious
activity
in
calder
was
on
the
state
of
california,
here
the
focus
of
the
tortious
activity
was
on
the
state
of
georgia.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it
didn't
get
to
nevada.
based
on
respondents'
own
allegations,
it
was
sent
to
an
ausa
in
georgia
for
forfeiture
proceedings
in
georgia.
and,
notably,
had
respondents
wanted
to
regain
their
property
during
the
6
months'
period
of
seizure,
they
would
have
had
to
go
to
georgia
to
do
so.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
based
on
the
current
record,
i
don't
know
that
we
do.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
allegations,
they
suggest
that
the
excul
--
what
they
call
the
exculpatory
information
was
left
out
of
the
affidavit.
the
affidavit
itself,
if
it
even
exists,
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
and,
you
know,
by
focusing
--
you
asked
the
question,
your
honor,
about
what
the
gravamen
of
this
case
is.
i
think
in
a
very
real
way,
the
gravamen
of
the
case
is
the
initial
seizure.
the
ninth
circuit
focused
exclusively
on
the
affidavit
and
respondents
do
so
here
as
well.
but
i
think
it's
a
quintessential
example
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
the
affidavit
is,
at
best,
a
thin
and
artificial
read.
even
if
you
were
to
focus
exclusively
on
the
affidavit,
as
i
explained--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--there
isn't
for
purposes
of
--
of
this
case
in
this
court
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
otherwise.
but
while
there
may
be
a
distinct
claim,
there
is
no
distinct
injury.
the
injury
that
respondents
allege
based
on
the
affidavit
is
simply
that
the
initial
seizure
continued
beyond
the
time
that
it
otherwise
would
have
and
for
that
reason
the
harm,
the
same
economic
harm
that
they
were
already
feeling
in
nevada,
continued
beyond
a
certain
person
point
in
time.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
again,
obviously,
that's
not
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
case
would
be
any
different
because,
assuming
that
the
affidavit
looks
the
same
as
it's
alleged
to
look
in
this
case,
it
would
still
be
focused
--
that
money
in
georgia
and
everything
about
it
would
still
be
related
to
georgia.
again,
the
only
connection
to
nevada
would
be
the
fact
that
respondents
felt
some
harm
in
that
state.
it's
not
a
harm
that's
unique
in
any
respect
to
nevada.
it's
a
harm
they
would
have
felt
no
matter
where
they
traveled.
if
they
had
gone
to
their
other
residence
in
california,
if
they
had
left
on
another--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--no.
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
significant
here
that
the
respondents
did
go
to
georgia.
i
mean,
here
we
are
talking
about
a
traveling
plaintiff,
a
mobile
plaintiff,
who
voluntarily
left
their
home
state
and
traveled
to
other
states,
traveled
to
new
jersey,
traveled
to
san
juan,
and
traveled
to
walden's
home
state,
the
place
where
he
lives
and
works,
and
brought
their
cash
with
them
there.
and
so
i
think
it
is
significant
that
they
did
travel
to
the
state
of
georgia
and
i
think
it
shows
how
broad
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
really
is.
as
far
as
law
engagement
officers,
though,
federal,
state
or
local,
this
is
a
really
problematic
decision
because
they
interact
with
travelers
from
all
50
states
and
beyond
on
a
daily
basis.
the
idea
that,
based
on
those
interactions,
that
they
can
be
hauled
into
a
far-away
and
distant
forum
based
on
nothing
more
than
their
interaction
with
a
traveler
and
finding
out
where
that
person
is
from,
which
of
course,
unlike
this
case
--
the
facts
here
are
somewhat
unique
in
that
the
drivers'
licenses
that
were
showed
were
not
from
the
state
of
nevada.
in
most
cases,
when
travelers
show
a
driver's
license,
it's
from
their
state
of
residence.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
at
all.
i
would
point
your
honor
to
the
court's
decision
in
stafford
v.
briggs.
in
that
case
--
it's
a
venue
case.
it's
about
1391(e).
in
that
case,
the
dissent
made
an
argument
that
that
provision
should
extend
to
personal
capacity
cases
against
government
officials.
and
one
of
the
arguments
made
is
there's
really
not
much
of
a
burden
on
them
because
they
have
doj
representation
and
because
they
have
indemnification.
and
the
majority
there
rejected
that
argument.
i
think
it's
equally
implausible
here,
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
not
only
did
the
ninth
circuit
rely
on
the
fact
of
doj
representation,
which,
mind
you,
is
not
a
guarantee,
it's
a
discretionary
determination;
but
not
only
did
they
rely
on
it,
they
relied
on
it
to
say
that
there
would
be
personal
jurisdiction
here
because
this
is
a
federal
official
or
really
a
state
official
deputized
as
a
federal
official.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
there's
more
difficult
questions
there
where
the
individual
hasn't
left
the
state
at
all
and
where
it's
targeted
at
the
state.
i
think
that
comes
to
your
honor's
question
about
what
it
means--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--that
is
what
i
said,
but
i
think
maybe
it
goes
to
your
honor's
other
question
earlier
about
what
it
means
to
expressly
aim
your
conduct
at
the
forum
state,
as
opposed
to
just
the
forum
resident,
when
we're
talking
about
an
intentional
tort.
in
the
cases
that
have
looked
at
this,
they've
--
they
have
looked
for
something
more
besides
simply
aiming
your
conduct
at
a
forum
resident,
some
indication
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
is
trying
to
reach
into
the
forum
state.
and
some
of
the
examples
that
have
come
up
is
when
they've
actually
sent
something
into
the
forum
state,
whether
it's
a
defamatory
article
or
a
letter,
the
bullet
example
that's
in
their
statement
and
mentioned
in
their
briefs.
in
those
cases,
the
defendant
is
actually
sending
something
physically
into
the
state
or,
for
example,
directing
activity
in
the
forum
state,
directing
something
to
happen
in
the
forum
state.
whatever
the
answer
is
to
that
hypothetical,
the
facts
here
are
really
quite
different.
walden
didn't
do
anything
to
reach
into
the
state
of
nevada.
and
as
my
colleague
pointed
out,
the
only
connection
to
nevada
and
the
idea
that
the
money
was
going
to
be
returned
there
and
eventually
was
returned
there
is
entirely
fortuitous.
it's
based
entirely
on
the
unilateral
acts
of
the
plaintiff,
the
fact
that
they
happened
to
hire
a
las
vegas
attorney.
if
they
hired--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--the
court,
i
think,
can
do
either.
my
preference
would
be--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--my
preference
would
be
that
--
the
same
as
petitioner's,
that
the
court
decide
it
on
personal
jurisdiction
grounds,
and
the
reasons
are
the
ones
expressed
in
the
federal
law
enforcement
officer
brief.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it
would
have
been
an
in
rem
action
against
the
assets.
it
would
have
been
a
forfeiture
complaint
that
would
have
been
filed
in
georgia.
and
in
those
proceedings,
the
respondents
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
contest
the
forfeiture.
if
during
either
the
pendency
before
those
proceedings
or
even
before
those
proceedings,
if
they
had
wanted
to
seek
to
regain
control
of
their
property,
they
would
have
had
to
file
a
motion
or
a
petition
in
the
state
of
georgia.
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
file
one
in
their
home
state.
and
again,
those
are
the
statutes
that
we
cite
at
page
31
of
our
brief.
the
consequence
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
here
really
is
to
allow
personal
jurisdiction
as
well
as
venue
to
travel
with
a
mobile
plaintiff
in
a
way
that
it
cannot
travel
with
mobile
chattel.
we've
talked
mostly
about
personal
jurisdiction
here,
but
could
i
--
if
i
could
just
take
a
quick
moment
on
venue
and
point
the
court
to
the
leroy
decision
in
1979.
nobody
contests
that
there
would
be
no
venue
in
the
district
of
nevada
under
the
leroy
decision.
the
language
change
in
1990
does
nothing
to
change
that
and
does
nothing
to
change
the
result
in
leroy.
respondents
avoid
the
statutory
text,
and
i
think
it
resolves
this
case.
thank
you.
