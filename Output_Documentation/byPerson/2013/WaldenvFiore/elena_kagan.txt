justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
does
it
mean
--
what
does
it
mean
in
the
context
of
an
intentional
tort,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
to
aim
at
a
particular
state,
if
it
doesn't
mean
to
aim
at
a
person
who
you
know
to
be
within
that
state?
i
mean,
nobody
conducts
an
intentional
tort
intending
to
injure
california
per
se.
you're
intending
to
injure
a
person
who
resides
in
california.
so
what
would
it
actually
mean
to
aim
conduct
at
a
state
irrespective
of
a
person?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
--
suppose
--
and
i'm
sorry.
please.
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
i
guess
i
just
--
the
--
the
mcintyre
example
is
a
very
different
kind
of
example
because
in
those
cases,
you
really
are
talking
about
a
company
seeking
to
serve
a
general
market
in
a
state.
but
intentional
tort
cases
don't
usually
have
that
quality.
you're
going
after
a
particular
person
in
an
intentional
tort
case.
and
it's
odd
to
think
of
going
after
an
intentional
--
a
particular
person,
whether
it's
a
defamation
suit
or
it's
a
fraud
suit
or
--
or
what
have
you,
as
--
as
targeting
the
state
itself.
justice
elena
kagan
would
you
--
would
your
answer
be
different,
suppose
that
the
officer
had
said,
you
can
keep
--
you
can
keep
your
money,
go
on
to
nevada
with
it,
and
then,
once
the
fiores
had
reached
nevada
the
officer
said
--
the
officer
filed
a
false
affidavit,
which,
let's
say,
froze
the
fiores'
bank
accounts.
would
your
--
would
your
answer
be
different?
the
affidavit
was
filed
in
georgia,
but
the
money
was
not
seized
in
georgia,
instead,
the
money
has
gone
on
to
nevada.
is
there
personal
jurisdiction
in
nevada?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
he
did
it
by
filing
an
affidavit
in
georgia
and
then
it
froze
a
bank
account.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sherry,
just
to
try
to
figure
out
how
far
your
argument
goes,
suppose
there's
an
irs
agent
sitting
in
washington,
d.c.,
and
she
maliciously
does
something,
files
an
affidavit,
does
whatever
she
does
to
impose
a
tax
penalty
on
somebody
in
nevada
and
everything
that
she
does
happens
in
washington,
d.c.--
does
the
person
in
nevada,
who
is
the
victim
of
this
malicious
attempt
to
impose
a
tax
penalty,
have
to
go
to
washington,
d.c.
to
sue
her?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
she's
a
very
mobile
person.
she
lives
in
nevada,
but
she
goes
other
places,
and
--
and
this
could,
you
know,
harm
her
wherever
she
goes.
isn't
that
what
you
said?
so
why
should
she
be
able
to
bring
suit
in
nevada
under
your
view?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
it
were
about
them--
justice
elena
kagan
--so
--
so
suppose
they
seized
a
gold
watch--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
then
they
refused
to
return
the
gold
watch.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
gold
watch
really
is
still
sitting
there
in
georgia.
justice
elena
kagan
okay?
would
you
say
that
--
that
then
there's
--
there's
personal
jurisdiction
in
nevada?
justice
elena
kagan
yeah,
they
seize
it
and
then
there's
a
false
affidavit
keeping
it.
justice
elena
kagan
and
the
complaint
is
only
about
the
false
affidavit,
but
it's
in
reference
to
property
that
is
indisputably
in
georgia.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
goldstein,
as
i
understood
what
mr.
bucholtz
was
saying,
he
was
saying
there
is
a
distinction
between
an
officer
who
commits
a
fraud
in
georgia,
when
your
money
is
in
nevada,
and
so
he
commits
a
fraud
and
he
freezes
your
bank
accounts
in
nevada,
versus
he
commits
a
fraud
by
filing
this
affidavit.
but
it
is
as
to
money
that
is
located
where
he
is,
not
where
you
are,
but
where
he
is
in
georgia.
that's
the
distinction
that
i
understood
him
to
be
drawing.
justice
elena
kagan
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
so
there'd
be
a
difference
if
the
bag
had
been
shipped
to
washington,
d.c.?
and,
you
know,
money
is
--
is
fungible.
money
is
everywhere
and
nowhere.
so
it
--
it
seems
as
though
money
is
a
bit
different
from
a
gold
watch,
that
--
that
it
was
--
it's
only
contingent
that
the
money
remained
in
atlanta
rather
than
being
shipped
to
a
bank
someplace
else.
