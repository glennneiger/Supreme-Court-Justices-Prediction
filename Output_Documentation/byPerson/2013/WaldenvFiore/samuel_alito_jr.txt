justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
think
the
court
meant
when
it
said
that
the
--
the
article
was
aimed
at
california?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
it
was
distributed,
it
was
distributed
everywhere.
it
was
the
national
enquirer,
so
it
was
probably
in
every
supermarket
in
the
country.
and
why
does
california
as
an
abstract
entity
care
about
an
article
that
makes
allegedly
defamatory
statements
about
things
that
people
supposedly
did
in
california?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
would
be
true
even
if
the
respondents
had
never
been
in
georgia?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
relevant
in
a
case
like
this
whether
the
--
the
federal
officer
who
is
sued
is
represented
by
the
justice
department?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
not
professional
gamblers.
let's
say
they
were
major
league
umpires
or
they
are
members
of
a
rock
group
that's
going
on
a
tour
of
25
cities.
where
would
there
be
personal
jurisdiction
there?
in
every
place
where
the
umpire
was
going
to
appear
at
a
game?
every
place
where
the
group
was
going
to
perform?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
here
the
--
here
the
plaintiffs
apparently
lived
in
two
places,
right,
california
and
nevada?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
suppose
my
hypothetical
rock
performer
has
five
houses,
one
in
california,
one
in
montana
and
so
forth.
he
--
personal
jurisdiction
everywhere?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
were
sufficiently
residents
of
california
to
get
california
driver's
licenses,
were
they
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
you
move
on
from
that
point--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--your
argument
is
dependent
on
the
fact
that
the
officer
here
knew
that
the
--
the
plaintiffs
were
residents
of
nevada;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
should
that
make
any
difference?
the
conduct
is
the
same;
the
injury
is
the
same.
what
if
he
didn't
know?
then
there
would
be
no
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you're
talking
about
the
internet,
you're
in
a
different
world.
but
this
is
a
--
the
facts
here
are
old-fashioned.
everything
that
happened
here
could
have
happened
in
1920.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
have
happened
in
--
in
the
19th
century.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
i
don't
see
what
the
internet
has
to
do
with
this.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
that
we
should
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
dismiss
--
the
dismissal
and
send
it
back
for
the
district
court
to
consider
whether
the
case
should
be
transferred?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
know
that,
so
that's
why
i'm
confused
by
what
you're
saying
about
transfer.
