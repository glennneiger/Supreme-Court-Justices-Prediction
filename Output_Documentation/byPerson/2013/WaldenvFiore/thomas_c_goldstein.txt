mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
you
are
being
asked
by
the
other
side
to
write
an
opinion
about
personal
jurisdiction
that
is
going
to
try
and
slice
the
salami
very,
very,
very
thin,
that
is
going
to
create
a
huge
amount
of
confusion
about
these
facts
versus
the
facts
in
calder,
and
that
is
going
to
be
very,
very
difficult
to
reconcile
with
the
internet
cases
and
the
cases
that
the
lower
courts
are
constantly
confronting
about
where
a
person
in
state
a
intentionally
injures
a
person
in
state
b.
and
that
person
frequently
doesn't
shoot
a
gun
into
the
other
state.
they
sit
at
their
computer
and
they
steal
money
under
the
bank
account.
they
take
the
person's
id.
they
use
their
credit
cards
and
the
like.
i
think
in
truth
the
way
the
case
is
most
likely
to
be
resolved--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
we
disagree,
and
so
let
me
focus
on
your
point
and
justice
kennedy's
question
about
which
claim
it
is.
the
claim
here
--
the
complaint
states
two
complaints,
judge
berzon
recognized.
one
is
about
the
seizure.
it's
exactly
what
you
are
describing.
the
other
is
about
the
false
affidavit.
and
those
really
are
different
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
have
a
couple
of
citations
to
give
you
to
explain
how
this
legal
process
works.
what
happens
is
the
dea
seizes
the
money
at
the
atlanta
hartsfield
airport.
he
takes
the
cash
and
turns
it
in
to
a
locker.
then
what
happens
is
that
we
have
to
state
a
claim
to
the
money.
and
when
we
state
a
claim
to
the
money,
they
either
have
to
do
one
of
two
things:
they
have
to
give
it
back
to
us
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
they
have
to
start
a
forfeiture
process
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
if
you
start
the
forfeiture
process,
you
have
to
provide
to
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
a
factual
basis
for
the
forfeiture.
and
the
way
to
look
at
this,
i
think,
is
the
way
that
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
asked,
and
that
is
imagine
that
there
were
two
officers
here,
not
one.
officer
a
--
we'll
call
him
walden
--
is
at
the
atlanta
hartsfield
airport,
and
he
seizes
our
money.
and
just
assume
that
that's
perfectly
lawful.
we
then
state
a
claim
to
the
money,
and
then
we
provide
factual
information
about
why
it
is
that
the
money
is
not
subject
to
seizure.
they
have
to
return
it
to
us
at
that
point
or
they
have
to
start
the
forfeiture
process.
and
when
that
second
officer
creates
a
false
affidavit
to
start
the
forfeiture
process,
we
are
not
in
georgia.
we
have
no
ongoing
contacts
with
georgia.
and
we
are
losing
access
to
the
money
only
in
nevada.
that's
the
only
place
we're
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
sir.
the
lower
courts
have
tackled
this
question
because
people
go
visit
their
mother-in-law.
they
do
travel
around.
it's
a
mobile
society,
and
they
have
taken
from
your
opinion
in
calder
and
jones
the
focus
on
where
it
is
that
the
plaintiff
lives
and
works.
and
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that.
personal
jurisdiction
is
trying
to
tackle
the
question
of
where
does
the
defendant
reasonably
believe
that
he
will
be
hailed
into
court.
it's
a
fairness
principle.
and
that
is,
we
need
to
have
a
predictable
rule
that
allows
the
would-be
defendants
to
know,
okay,
if
i
do
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
sir.
the
--
and
let
me
just
start
with
the
premise
of
this
case,
all
right?
my
friend
said
that
this
officer
was
shown
the
california
--
california
driver's
license.
that's
not
correct.
he
wasn't
shown
a
california
driver's
license.
the
officer
in
san
juan,
puerto
rico
was
shown
one.
they
only
--
their
principal
residence,
the
complaint
alleges
i
think
in
paragraph
2,
is
in
nevada.
we
do
have
situations
--
and
that's
where
they
lived
and
worked.
we
have
situations--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
true
at
one
point,
and
they
had
moved.
i'm
going
to
step
outside
the
record
just
so
i
can
accurately
answer
your
question.
but
it
will
give
you
a
sense
of
how
these
cases
actually
operate.
most
often,
you
have
the
situation
where
they're
college
students.
you
know,
you
have
a
college
student
who
lives
at
home
with
their
parents,
but
they
go
off
to
college,
and
they
may
be
injured
where
it
is
that
they
live
and
go
to
school
in
that
case.
and
what
the
lower
courts
do
is
sensibly,
they
say,
if
you
know
where
the
person's
principal
residence
is
--
and
this
case
is
simplified
by
the
fact
that
the
district
court
understood
and
assumed
that
the
defendant
knew
that
they
lived
in
nevada.
it's
never
been
contested
in
the
case,
and
judge
berzon
said
quite
correctly,
what
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
make
it
a
prima
facie
case,
because
there's
no
evidence
in
this
case,
that
the
principal
residence
was
nevada
and
that
the
defendant
knew
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--then
i've
misled
you,
and
let
me
state
our
test,
which
i
haven't
done
yet,
and
that
may
help
you.
our
rule
is
as
follows:
when
the
defendant
intentionally
targets
the
plaintiff
for
injury
in
state
a
where
the
injury
arises
--
and
that's
going
to
be
the
big
difference.
does
the
injury
arise
there?
justice
scalia,
your
impression
in
your
earlier
question
was
that
this
injury
didn't
arise
in
nevada.
but
our
test
requires
that
it
arise
in
nevada,
and
the
defendant
knows
that
it's
going
to
arise
in
nevada.
i'll
contrast
our
--
our
false
seizure
claim,
right?
we
were
in
the
airport.
we
lose
the
$97,000.
if
we
then
go
back
to
nevada
and
then
file
suit,
our
injury
can't
travel
with
us.
and
that's
the
big
concern.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
have
not
seen--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
that
kind
of
situation
where
the
injury
actually
--
and
you
have
named
several
situations.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so
justice
breyer,
it
is
our
position
that
in
that
situation,
there
is
not
personal
jurisdiction.
and
let
me
try--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
the
difference
is
that
the
defendant
in
that
instance,
the
injury
arises
at
the
bookstore.
okay?
and
the
fact
that
it
has
a
continuing
effect,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
lower
courts
uniformly
treat
the
injury
arising
as
in
the
bookstore.
but
there
are
situations
that
you
can
imagine
the
following:
and
that
is
he
loses
the
billfold
in
the
store.
okay.
that
injury
arose
there.
now,
someone
takes
the
credit
card
from
the
billfold
after
he
has
gone
home,
knows
that
he's
at
home,
and
starts
spending
his
money
with
it.
that
injury
arises
where
he
lives.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
the
cases
that
are
closest
to
that,
two
of
them
are
at
page
25a
of
the
petition
appendix.
they
are
the
bancroft
case,
and
that
--
these
are
not
going
to
be
billfold
cases.
okay?
billfold
cases,
people
tend
not
to
--
if
you
lose
$100,
people
don't
file
a
lawsuit.
these
are
bigger
cases.
and
it's
the
petition
appendix.
you've
pulled
open
the
red
brief,
so
i
am
asking
you
for
the
cert
petition.
the
bancroft
case
at
25a
is
where
a
georgia
resident
writes
to
a
virginia
registrar
and
the
registrar
misappropriates
the
website
of
a
california
company.
and
that
is
they
never
set
foot
in
california.
they
don't,
you
know,
do
anything
in
california
at
all.
and
there,
there
is
jurisdiction
in
california
because
they
know
that
the
person's
going
to
be
hurt
in
california.
the
next
one
is
metropolitan
life.
that
--
the
same
page.
an
alabama
resident
writes
to
an
insurance
company
and
they
say,
"ah,
i'm
entitled
to
the
insurance
proceeds.
"
but
the
actual
proceeds
belong
to
someone
in
california.
and
they
never
get
the
money.
so
it's
like
this
case.
the
money
never
gets
sent
into
california.
and
these
remote
injury
cases--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
weren't
going
and
spending
it.
they
were--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
sir.
i
--
i
was
trying
to
take
a
billfold
example
and
--
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
and
there's
a
case
that's
discussed
in
several
of
the
briefs
called
dudnikov
and
that
involves
an
--
an
ebay
--
ebay-like
auction
and
someone
in
one
state
blocks
an
auction
in
another
state.
so
one
of
the
impressions--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
money
here
was--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
here's
the
thing
about
it.
this
is
no
longer
about
the
cash.
and
this
--
the
actual
answer
to
your
question
is
he
turns
the
money
in
at
a
locker,
okay?
then
it's
deposited
into
an
account.
it's
not
about
the
physical
money
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
at
that
point.
we
weren't
--
when
we
got
the
money,
nobody
sent
us
a
duffle
bag
full
of
cash.
there
was
a
check,
of
course.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
in
same
facts,
and
that
is
a
false
affidavit,
it's
not
just
they
seized
it,
it's
they
make
a
false--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
i
do
think,
if
you
can
prove
an
injury,
which
i
think
is
very
hard
from
the
gold
watch
--
let's
say
a
computer,
just
to
make
it
a
little
bit
more
plausible,
that
they
would
be
hurt
in
nevada,
then,
yes,
i
do
think
if
you
can
make
out
an
injury,
which
isn't
--
the
tort
doesn't
arise
until
the
injury
occurs.
that's
why
the
lower
courts
treat
these
cases
as
the
tort
occurring
where
the
victim
is.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
so,
i
don't
think
we
are
trying
to
push
the
bounds.
let
me
make
one
point
about
mcentyre
and
then
try
and
correct
the
misimpression
that
i
think
that's
been
left,
that
there
are
a
few
contacts
between
nevada
and
this
case
and
hopefully
prove
to
you
that
there
are
far
more
contacts
between
this
tort
and
this
forum
than
will
be
true
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
that
the
lower
courts
confront.
and
the
point
i
would
make,
justice
ginsburg,
and
it's
made
by
the
plurality
in
mcentyre,
is
that
there
have
always
been
special
rules
for
intentional
tort
cases.
that's
the
distinction
and
that's
why
calder
comes
out
the
way
it
does,
citing
restatement
section
32nd
of
the
second
--
the
second
restatement
of
the
conflict
of
laws.
and
that
is
the
reason
--
it's
not
just
made
up.
the
reason
there's
a
special
rule
for
intentional
torts
is
that
the
defendant
knows
he's
hurting
someone
somewhere
else,
and
therefore
expects
to
be
hailed
into
court.
the
view
of
the
mcentyre
plurality,
of
course,
was
that
the
overseas
manufacturer
there
wasn't
itself
doing
anything
directed
at
the
forum.
but
if
i
could
just
get
to
the
very
important
point
about--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
they
lived
and
worked
there.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
--
that
is
actually
generally
what
the
lower
courts
hold,
and
their
reason
is
that
the
defendant
is
doing
something
knowing
that
he
may
be
hailed
into
that
court.
it
is
a
defendant-favoring
rule
that
intends
--
attempts
to
give
predictability.
now,
if
that's
wrong,
it
doesn't
hurt
my
case
because
as
the
case
comes
to
you,
it's
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
there
is
a--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
almost
like
the
fourth
amendment
reasonable
expectations
to
privacy.
there
is
a
circularity
here.
but
it's
not
entirely
circular
because
we're
talking
about
a
specific
state
here.
it's
not
that
he
knows
that
the
plaintiffs
might
be
--
live
in
georgia
or
might
live
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
it's
a
very
specific
state
and
that's
why
it's
not
circular.
now,
if
i
could
just
help
you
understand
our
view
that
there
are
a
lot
more
contacts
between
this
tort
and
nevada
than
in
the
great,
great
--
at
least
90
percent
of
the
cases
the
lower
courts
are
confronting.
so
here
are
the
points
that
i
would
make
about
those
contexts,
and
there
are
six,
and
i
will
try
and
be
brief.
the
case
involves
money
owned
by
nevada
residents,
$30,000
of
which
originated
in
nevada
and
all
of
which
was
on
its
way
to
nevada.
second,
the
defendant
intentionally
hurt
the
plaintiffs
knowing
that
they
would
lose
access
to
the
money
in
nevada,
where
they
lived
and
worked.
third,
we
will
use
documents
in
nevada
to
prove
that
his
action
was
intentional
because
it
omitted
the
information
that
the
defendant
requested.
this
is
not
a
uni
--
us
unilaterally
sending
money.
at
the
atlanta
airport,
he
said
send
us
the
proof
that
the
funds
are
legitimate,
that
he
requested
and
received
from
the
plaintiffs
in
nevada,
and
that
he
learned
in
searching
a
nevada
law
enforcement
database,
which
is
paragraph
79
of
the
complaint.
the
two
last
points
i
would
make
is
that
the
plaintiffs
will
show
that
they
were
deprived
of
the
money
in
nevada
until
the
nevada
lawyer
they
had
to
hire
used
records
in
nevada
to
persuade
the
government
to
send
the
money
to
nevada.
and
the
plaintiffs
in
their
case,
of
course,
will
show,
because
it
is
the
fact
that
they
are
gamblers
working
in
las
vegas,
that
the
economic
injury
occurred
to
them
there.
now,
if
you
think
that's
not
enough,
if
you
conclude
that's
not
enough,
you
are
closing
the
door
absolutely
to
all
of
the
internet
cases,
because
those
are
cases
where
someone
sits
at
the
computer
and
targets
someone
in
another
state.
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
alito,
you
always
tell
us
that
you've
got
to
write
a
legal
rule.
and
there
is
no
special
personal
jurisdiction
rule,
and
the
lower
courts--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
the
kinds
of
internet
cases
--
and
it's
wrong
for
me
to
just
say
internet
--
the
kinds
of
cases
that
i'm
talking
about
are
the
fraud
cases,
the
intentional
tort
cases--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you
steal
--
you're
sitting
in
georgia
--
you
don't,
but
someone
is
sitting
in
georgia
and
they
steal
the
identity
of
someone
who's
in
nevada.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
why
i
took
it
immediately
back,
recognizing
the
error.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
but
there
are
bad
people
in
the
world,
obviously,
and
those
people
do,
with
increasing
and
distressing
frequency
with
these
new
tools
of
communication,
they
are
very,
very
capable
of
causing
significant
harm
to
someone
else
without
actually
do
--
setting
foot
in
the
state.
now,
i
have
to
offer
you
a
solution.
let
me
just
be
clear.
i
recognize
that
this
can
go
either
way,
because
if
i
say
internet
cases,
well,
then
i'm
opening
the
door
to
potentially
a
very
wide-ranging
set
of
cases
going
into
nevada,
and
we
have
here
the
special
case
of
a
law
enforcement
officer,
and
i
believe
that
i
do
have
the
solution.
and
that
is,
this
is
actually
a
case
about
transfer.
it
is
not
a
case
about
jurisdiction
and
venue.
this
is
the
unusual
case
where
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
did
not
file
a
1404
motion
to
transfer.
and
this
case
is
a
lot
--
you
should
treat
it
like
atlantic
marine.
because
what
you
need
to
do
is
recognize,
i
think,
that
there's
the
big
category
of
jurisdiction.
where
there
is
jurisdiction,
there's
a
subset,
there
is
venue.
that's
where
you
can
file
a
lawsuit.
that
is
not
where
the
case
is
going
to
be
litigated.
and
in
these
cases,
what
defendants
uniformly
do,
and
the
lower
courts
pay
incredible
attention
to
the
fact
that
law
enforcement
officers
are
going
to
be
witnesses
or
are
the
defendant.
in
these
cases,
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
okay,
i
recognize
technically
there's
jurisdiction
and
venue,
but
let
me
tell
you
how
disruptive
it
will
be
if
i
actually
have
to
litigate
the
case
here.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
sir.
i
would
not
--
this
is
my
judgment.
i
do
not
want
it
reversed.
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
trying
to
describe
an
opinion
that
you
would
write
and
the
opinion
that
i
think
you
would
write
is
this,
and
it
says:
look,
personal
jurisdiction
in
the
wake
of
calder,
particularly
where
there
are
contacts
here,
exists.
venue
exists
because
several
of
these
are
events
or
omissions,
including
the
injury
that
occurs
in
nevada.
but
what
we
expect
the
lower
courts
to
do
in
a
case
like
this
is
to
pay
particular
attention
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
as
we
do
with
qualified
immunity,
to
have
an
efficient
process
in
which
the
defendant
can
say--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
i
am
not
trying
to
skip
over.
i
have
talked
for
this
entire
time
about
why
i
think
we
are
right
on
jurisdiction
and
venue,
and
i
am
pleased
to
return
to
the
issue.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
i
recognize
that
we
can't
have
--
there
are
two
ways
of
dealing
with
the
prospect
of
a
broad
personal
jurisdiction
rule.
one
is
to
narrow
it
substantially.
the
second
is
to
recognize
that
it
doesn't
determine
where
the
case
is
going
to
ultimately
be
litigated.
i
will
tell
you,
justice
ginsburg,
from
personally
reviewing
all
of
the
posy-calder
cases
in
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
that
the
contacts
here
are
much,
much
greater
between
nevada
and
this
tort
than
exists
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
that
the
lower
courts
are
confronting.
so
if
you--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--two
things
about
that.
that
is
the
rule
for
torts,
not
specifically
--
it
is
true
of
libel,
but
it
is
true
as
well
of
fraud.
the
fraud
occurs
where
the
person
is
defrauded.
it's
straight
from
the
restatement.
it's
the
ordinary
common
law
rule.
so
the
tort
does
happen
where
the
victim
is
injured
in
libel
and
in
a
case
like--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and,
justice
--
that's
correct.
and,
justice
scalia,
this
is
exactly
why
--
you
were
asking
the
question,
why
is
it
then-justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
calder
has
the
discussion
that
the
other
side
is
focusing
on
about
how
the
article
was
centered
on
california
and
how
it
came
from
california
sources.
now,
none
of
the
holding
of
the
case
describes
it,
but
you
wondered,
and
he
has
emphasized,
my
friend
has,
why
is
it
in
the
opinion?
and
it's
for
the
reason
you
have
just
given.
and
that
is
defamation
and
libel
cases,
when
you
are
talking
about
publication
to
the
internet
or
publication
nationwide
like
the
national
enquirer,
the
lower
courts
have
rightly
focused
on
the
fact,
can
we
say
that
this
isn't
just
directed
to
the
united
states?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
are
saying
the
same
thing.
i'm
just
not
explaining
my
view
of
it
well
enough
and
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
don't
think
so,
and
let
me
try
my
best.
all
right.
the
reason
these
defamation
cases
about
internet
and
national
publications
--
say
the
new
york
times
is
sued
for
defamation.
the
court
was
very
concerned
and
the
lower
courts
are
very
concerned
that
the
publisher
can't
be
sued
in
all
50
states.
and
so
what
the
lowers
courts
have
done
in
the
wake
of
calder
is
say,
i
know
you
published
it
to
the
whole
country,
national
enquirer,
but
is
it
fair
to
say
you
expected
to
be
haled
into
court
in
california
because
there
were
special
features
about
this
defamation?
now,
defamation
and
nationwide
publication
is
very
different
from
the
other
torts
the
lower
courts
confront,
which,
as
was
suggested
in
the
first
30
minutes
of
questioning,
i
think,
by
justice
kagan,
are
directed
at
a
person.
the
‵‵
shoot
the
gun
′′
example,
the
‵‵
defraud
the
victim
′′
example.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
i
agree
with
you,
but
i
will
say
in
my
defense
that
when
the
court
has
said,
when
we
are
trying
to
figure
out
if
there
are
minimum
contacts
and
whether
it's
consistent
with
fair
play
and
substantial
justice,
the
language
the
court
has
used
is,
is
it
fair,
because
the
defendant
could
reasonably
be
expected
--
could
reasonably
expect
to
be
haled
into
the
court.
that's
true
of
purposeful
availment
cases
like
mcintyre.
it's
true
of
intentional
tort
cases.
and
that
is,
we
measure
fairness
and
whether
you
are
getting
process
that
is
due
to
you
procedurally
by
whether
this
is
something
that
you
could
expect
to
happen
to
you--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
i
have
given
you
a
specific
test
about
where
you
have
to
intentional
injure
the
person,
knowing
that
they
will
be
injured
there
and
the
injury
has
to
arise
there.
and
as
i've
said,
the
way
in
intentional
tort
cases
that
has
to
work
is
that
the
lower
courts
recognize
that
a
tort
has
a
wrong
and
an
injury,
and
the
injury
is
what
makes
the
tort
complete
and
the
tort
occurs
where
the
victim
is.
just
take
the
‵‵
shoot
the
gun
′′
example.
right?
the
reason
is
that
the
person
is
injured
there.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
that
you
shoot
the
gun,
that
the
bullet
travels
across
the
state
line,
because
the
same
thing
can
happen
when
money
is
taken
out
of
your
bank
account.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
it
is
essentially
a
fraud
claim.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
he
knowingly
submitted
information
that
caused
the
government
not
to
send
us
the
money.
false--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
it's
actually
not
the
case
that
the
victim
has
to
be
misled
in
fraud,
justice
breyer,
so
for
example--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--a
knowing
misrepresentation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
here
to
the
government's
decision--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--right.
or
the
refusal
to
return.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
tort
that
we
are
alleging
here
is
essentially
common
law
fraud
under
bivens.
i
can
give
you
citations--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
the
citations
to
the
complaint
about
--
it
would
be
paragraphs
99
to
101.
it's
alleged
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
and
our
due
process
rights
to
have
submitted
the
false
affidavit
that
caused
the
government
not
to
send
us
the
money.
and
if
you
were
to
conclude,
justice
scalia,
that
this
injury
doesn't
arise
here,
let
me
just
tell
you
what
the
consequences
of
that
are.
and
that
is
there
are
a
large
number
of
cases
that
arise
constantly
where
people
lose
access
to
money.
where
they
don't
have
the
insurance
proceeds
sent
to
them
or
the
social
security
checks
or
the
irs
refunds.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
doesn't
make
any
practical
sense
to
me,
and
the
money
wasn't
in
georgia.
the
money
was
in
an
account
in
quantico,
virginia
that
belonged
to
the
dea.
what
difference
does
it
make
as
a
matter
of
personal
jurisdiction
between
the
following
two
cases
and
that,
the
defendant
is
sitting
in
georgia
steals
money
from
my
bank
account
in
nevada
or
the
defendant
sitting
in
georgia
causes
the
government
not
to
send
me
the
money
in
nevada.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
believe
that
the
elements
of
the
tort
that
justice
kagan
is
describing
are
the
same
elements
that
i
am
talking
about
here.
it's
just
where
the
money
starts.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
it
is
a
different
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
lower
courts
say
the
real
question
is,
where
--
is
this
the
kind
of
injury
that
will
arise
where
the
plaintiff
lives
and
works.
and
any
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
i
--
that
is
--
for
example,
on
our
seizure
claim,
we
acknowledge
that
at
the
very
least
there
wouldn't
be
venue.
and
there's
another
difference
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
had
returned
to
nevada
and
they
had
returned
to
living
and
working.
and
that
is,
in
our
actual
case,
we
have
the
documents
that
are
sent
at
his
request
from
nevada.
we
have
the
fact
that
he
searches
the
nevada
law
enforcement
databases.
and
we
have
the
fact
that
the
money
is
going
to
be
sent
by
the
government
to
nevada.
it's
requested
by
their
nevada
lawyer
sending
documents
from
nevada.
and
so
those
are
--
if
we
think
of
calder
as
a
case
in
which
there's
not
merely
injury
in
california,
but
a
few
extra
factors
that
were
in
california,
that's
much
more
this
case
than
it
is
any
of
the
other
cases
that
the
lower
courts
are
confronting.
i
would
just
discourage
the
court,
if
i
could,
from--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
ginsburg,
to
my
mind,
what
resembles
it
are
the
documents
that
go
from
nevada
to
the
defendant,
and
we
think
that's
a
--
specific
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
libel
and
defamation
case.
thank
you.
