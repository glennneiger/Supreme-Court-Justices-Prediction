do
you
have
any
preference
as
to
which
of
those
errors
you
would
like
us
to
rely
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
venue
question
does
not
--
does
not
bring
into
the
court
a
constitutional
question
and
the
jurisdictional
--
the
jurisdictional
one
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
usually
try
to
avoid
constitutional
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
largest
market
for
everything,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
affidavit
ever
get
to
nevada?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
sherry,
you
--
would
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
the
jurisdictional
question
or
the
venue
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
really
injure
a
person
in
state
b
here.
i
mean,
these
people
were
in
georgia
when
the
injury
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
really
arguing
for
a
very
broad
principle.
whenever
there
is
an
intentional
tort,
you
can
be
haled
into
court
at
the
place
of
residence
of
the
person
against
whom
the
tort
is
committed.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
money
here
in
georgia
the
whole
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
still
there
in
that
locker?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
say
that
about
whatever
rule
we
adopt.
once
we
adopt
the
rule,
when
--
the
defendant
will
know
that
if
he
violates
that
rule,
he's
going
to
be
hailed
into
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
a
self-fulfilling
point
you're
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
are
libeled
wherever
it
is
published.
you
don't
have
to
be
there
where
it's
published.
you
are
libeled
wherever
it
is
published.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
you
could
say
that
calder,
far
from
being
an
expansive
decision,
was
a
narrowing
decision.
it
said,
you
know,
there's
jurisdiction
not
necessarily
everywhere
where
the
libel
was
published,
which
is
where
the
injury
occurs,
but
there
is
jurisdiction
only
in
california,
where
these
other
connections
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
it's
harder
for
you
to
establish
that
the
injury
occurred
in
nevada.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
our
jurisdiction
cases
have
not
been
based
on
where
you
expected
to
be
sued.
you
could
expect
to
be
sued
anywhere
if
the
state
says
you
are
going
to
be
sued
here.
our
cases
have
focused
on
whether
the
state
has
jurisdiction,
whether
the
state
has
enough
connection
with
it
to
assert
its
power;
not
the
expectation
of
the
defendant,
but
the
power
of
the
state.
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
new
test,
just
whether
you
could
expect
this
to
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
affidavit
wouldn't
give
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
