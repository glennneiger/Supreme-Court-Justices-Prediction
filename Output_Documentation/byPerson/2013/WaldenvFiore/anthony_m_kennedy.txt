but
in
--
in
this
case,
it
was
known
or
should
have
been
known
that
these
were
gamblers,
they
were
in
nevada.
that's
where
a
lot
of
--
that's
where
their
gambling
takes
place.
they
were
residents
of
nevada.
so
in
that
sense,
they
were
like
the
plaintiff
in
--
in
calder.
the
injury
was
there
and
the
defendant
arguably
knew
or
should
have
known
that
that's
where
its
major
impact
would
be.
i
recognize
your
point
that
when
you
take
money
away,
then
you're
inconvenienced
in
any
state
where
you
happen
to
be.
but
there
was
an
argument
here
--
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
argument
here
that
this
was
gambling
and
these
people
were
from
nevada
and
so
you've
--
this
--
this
curtails
their
right
or
--
or
their
option
to
conduct
--
to
conduct
their
activities
in
--
in
nevada.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
this
--
and
it's
probably
clear
in
the
briefs.
is
--
is
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
the
seizure
at
the
airport
or
the
later
false
affidavit?
because
to
the
extent
it's
the
later
false
affidavit,
that
cuts
against
you
marginally.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
know
how
much
of
the
information,
the
supplemental
information,
that
was
prepared
in
nevada
and
then
was
forwarded
to
georgia,
how
much
of
that
information
was
in
the
affidavit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
this
record
or
these
complaints
be
read
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
injury
was
substantially
altered
by
the
false
affidavit,
based
on
the
misuse
of
the
information
received
from
nevada?
