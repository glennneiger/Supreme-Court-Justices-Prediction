mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
holding
that
the
--
in
holding
that
respondents
could
bring
this
bivens
lawsuit
against
officer
anthony
walden
in
nevada,
the
ninth
circuit
made
two
errors
that
independently
require
a
reversal.
first,
as
to
personal
jurisdiction,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
was
sufficient
that
respondents
have
connections
to
nevada,
and
that
officer
walden
allegedly
targeted
his
conduct
at
them,
knowing
of
their
contacts
with
nevada.
that
plaintiff-centered
approach
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedence
which
emphasize
that
the
defendant
himself
must
have
meaningful
contacts
with
the
forum
state.
second,
as
to
venue,
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
respondents
felt
in
nevada
the
effects
of
officer
walden's
alleged
conduct
in
georgia.
that
similarly
plaintiff-centered
approach
is
in
conflict
with
the
text
of
the
venue
statute,
1391(b)(2)
which
focuses
on
where
the
events
or
omissions
giving
rise
to
the
claim
occurred,
not
where
the
impact
of
those
events
or
omissions
may
be
felt.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
federal
law
enforcement
officers'
amicus
brief,
which
i
will
try
to
explain,
i
think
that
it
would
be
preferable
for
the
court
to
address
personal
jurisdiction
and
not
just
venue.
that
the
reason
is
that
venue
in
removed
cases
works
differently.
there
really
is
no
venue
per
se
in
removed
cases.
and
so
if
the
court
only
reaches
venue
here
and
holds
that
venue
is
improper,
in
theory,
and
maybe
there
are
limitations
problems
with
this,
but
in
theory,
the
plaintiffs
could
refile
the
same
lawsuit
in
state
court
in
nevada.
it
would
be
a
bivens
lawsuit;
it
would
arise
under
federal
law
so
we
would
remove
it.
but
then
removal
would
mean
under
1441(a)
venue
would
be
proper
per
se
in
the
district
of
removal,
because
that's
the
way
removal
works,
and
this
court
so
held
in
policia
half
a
century
ago.
and
then
there
would
be
no
personal
jurisdiction
and
then
the
personal
jurisdiction
would
be
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
and
we'd
be
back
exactly
where
we
are
now.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
that's
true.
and
the
avoidance
canon
is
certainly
one
factor
the
court
could
take
into
account
in
deciding
which
issue
to
reach
or
which
issues
to
reach
or
in
what
order.
on
the
other
hand,
the
personal
jurisdiction
question
is
--
is
a
constitutional
question,
but
it's
not
a
constitutional
question
in
the
strong
sense
of
the
term,
because
the
only
reason
that
the
--
the
personal
jurisdiction
question,
as
applied
in
this
case,
is
a
constitutional
one
is
because
congress
hasn't
provided
for
nationwide
service
of
process
for
bivens
claims.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
omni
capital
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
that.
it's
not
for
the
court
to
do
that
on
its
own,
to
fill
a
perceived
policy
gap
in
personal
jurisdiction
law.
and
so
even
though
it
is
a
constitutional
question
as
currently
configured,
if
congress
thought
that
it
were
a
problem
to
apply
the
existing
personal
jurisdiction
jurisprudence
to
bivens
claims
and
wanted
to
provide
for
nationwide
service
of
process
based
on
the
idea
that
what
counts
is
contacts
with
the
u.s.
as
a
whole
as
opposed
to
any
particular
state.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
i'm
not
suggesting
that
congress
should
do
that.
i
think
congress
should
not
do
that.
i
think
bivens
claims,
for
the
reason
that
your
honor
just
stated,
is
--
is
sort
of
the
last
place
that
--
that
anyone
should
start
to
create
a
more
plaintiff-friendly
version
of
personal
jurisdiction.
the
court
has
gone
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
ordinary
course
in
a
--
in
a
case
starting
in
district
court
under
section
1631
or
--
or
the
venue
statute,
that
would
be
an
appropriate
course.
here
the
district
court
asked
respondents
specifically,
if
i
agree
with
officer
walden
on
personal
jurisdiction
or
venue,
do
you
want
me
to
transfer
or
do
you
want
me
to
dismiss?
because
the
statute
gives
the
district
court
discretion
and
--
and
says
in
the
interest
of
justice,
transfer
is
--
is
permissible
in
lieu
of
dismissal.
the
respondents
said
emphatically,
we
don't
want
you
to
transfer.
we
want
you
to
dismiss.
i
guess
they
--
they
decided
they
would
rather
have
an
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
take
their
--
their
chances
with
--
with
an
appeal,
then
pursue
the
case
in
georgia.
so
i
think
under
the
unusual--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there
--
there
is
definitely
some
language
in
calder
that
could
be
read
in
a
variety
of
ways.
i
think
the
key
language
in
calder
--
excuse
me
--
as
the
court
states
its
conclusions,
it
says:
"in
sum,
california
was
the
focal
point
both
of
the
article
and
of
the
harm
suffered
by
the
plaintiffs.
"
and
then
the
court
later
says
that
--
that
the
defendants
expressly
aimed
their
conduct
at
california.
it
doesn't
say
at
the
plaintiff,
who
happened
to
be
in
california;
it
says
at
california.
and
i
think
that's
not
an
accident
that
the
court
used
those
formulations.
in
all
of
the
personal
jurisdiction
cases
before
calder
and
since,
and
for
that
matter
decided
the
same
day,
in
keeton,
decided
the
same
day
as
calder,
the
court
has
emphasized
that
random,
attenuated,
and
fortuitous
contacts
with
the
forum
state
are
in
sufficient
and
that
in
particular
contacts
between
the
defendant
and
the
--
and
the
forum
that
are
created
by
the
unilateral
activity
of
the
plaintiff
are
not
sufficient.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
i
think
what
the
court
meant,
justice
alito,
is
that
the
article
was
distributed
in
california
and
california
was
by
far
the
largest
market
for
the
national
enquirer.
the
article
recounted
events
or
--
or
alleged
events,
that
happened
in
california.
and
the
article
was
drawn
from
california
sources.
so
it's
not
fortuitous
that
the
effect
of
the
article
was
felt
in
california.
that
was
--
that
was
--
nothing
about
that
was
fortuitous
because
the
--
the
defendants
knew
that
the
article
would
be
distributed
widely
in
california,
and
that
it
was
the
largest
market,
and
they--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
let
me
try
to
answer
the
first
part
of
your
question
first,
justice
alito.
it's
true
that
the
national
enquirer
was
national,
it
was
distributed
throughout
the
country.
but
the
court
went
to
pains
in
the
opinion
to
emphasize
that
california
was
the
largest
market.
and
so
when
the
court
said
the
brunt
of
the
harm
--
that
--
this
is
right
after
the
court's
reference
to
express
aiming,
where
the
court
says--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
in
particular
for
national
enquirer
when
you're
talking
about
articles
about
celebrities,
about
actresses
in
particular,
that
allegedly
injured
their
professional
reputation
and
prevent
them
from
getting
future
acting
jobs.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--right.
i
think
--
i
think
the
way
that
--
that
calder
reads,
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
factors.
one
of
them
is
plaintiff's
residence
in
california.
that's
where
she
was
when
she
suffered
the
emotional
distress
from
--
from
reading
the
article
about
herself
and
where
her
job
prospects
were
allegedly
adversely
affected.
but
it's
also
true
the
court
points
out
that
not
only
is
--
when
the
court
says
the
defendants
expressly
aimed
their
conduct
at
california,
the
next
passage
after
that
where
the
court
explains
what
that
--
what
express
aiming
in
california
means,
it
says
california
was
not
only
where
ms.
jones
suffered
the
brunt
of
the
harm,
but
where
the
defendants
knew
that
the
enquirer
had
its
largest
circulation.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
disentangle
the
fact
that
that's
where
she
was,
which,
of
course,
was
a
relevant
factor
in
that
case
because
it
was
true,
from
the
fact
that
the
defendants
in
a
broader
sense,
in
a
more
--
in
a
sense
not
based
on
her
unilateral
activity,
but
in
a
sense
based
on
their
own
contacts,
aimed
at
california.
they
drew
their--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
justice
kagan,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
it
could
take
a
few
forms.
it
depends
on
the
type
of
case.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
try
to
come
up
with
the
single,
you
know,
sort
of
comprehensive
unitary
answer
to
that
question
that
would
govern
all
types
of
cases.
i
think
the
way
that
the
plurality
put
it
in
j.
mcintyre
for
intentional
tort
cases
is
that
maybe
you're
intending
to
obstruct
the
laws
of
the
forum
state.
that
would
be
more
meaningfully
aimed
at
the
forum
state
qua
state
and
not
just
somebody
who
happens
to
be
in
it
or
have
a
connection
to
it.
another
way
that
conduct
could
be
aimed
at
a
state
would
be
if
--
if
it's
a
species
of
purposeful
availment
or
purposeful
direction,
where
you're
projecting
your
conduct
into
that
state,
whether
that's
--
whether
that's
physical
or
literal
or
whether
it's
--
it's
through
some
indirect
or
technological
means
for--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--for
some
benefit,
for
some
reason,
where
you're
projecting
your
conduct
into
that
state,
not
just
because
that's
where
the
plaintiff
happens
to
be,
which
is
incidental
and
irrelevant
to
you
that
the
plaintiff
is
there
as
opposed
to
anywhere
else,
but
because
you're
seeking
that
state
out.
that
could
be
--
it
could
be,
in
a
case
like
j.
mcintyre,
the
court,
of
course,
divided
over
whether
in
a
--
in
a
very
broad
sense,
sending
your
product
into
the
stream
of
commerce
intending
that
it
in
some
sense,
you
know,
go
to
the
u.s.
as
a
whole
without
any
particular
focus
on
a
given
state,
was
sufficient.
but
at
least
there,
at
least
there,
you
have
the
intent
to
serve
the
u.s.
market
as
a
whole.
and
so
you
at
least
are
on
notice
that
your
own
conduct
is
putting
you
at
risk
of
being
hailed
into
court
in
any
one
of
the
states.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
i
think
if
it's
a
defamation
suit,
justice
kagan,
if
you
project
your
defamation
into
the
forum
state,
then
it's
fair
to
say
that
you've
in
a
sense
entered
the
forum
state,
whether
that's
electronic
or
physical
as
in
calder.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
kennedy,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
plaintiffs
had
contacts
with
nevada,
were
residents
of
nevada.
of
course,
they
showed
officer
walden
california
licenses.
that's
what
the
complaint
alleges,
not
nevada
licenses.
and
so
at
the
time
of
their
actual--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--they
do
say
that.
but
there's
no
reason
to
think,
and
even
they
don't
allege
this,
that
officer
walden
knew
that
at
the
time
that
he
actually
interacted
with
them.
and
so
there's
no
allegation
that
he--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
i
would
emphasize
〝
marginally
′′,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
think
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
is
both.
i
don't
think
there's
a
way
to
separate
them.
the
effect
that
the
plaintiffs
are
--
the
reason
for
their
lawsuit,
their
claiming
damages
based
on
the
allegedly
false
affidavit,
is
that
it
took
them
longer
than
it
otherwise
would
have
to
get
their
money
back.
it's
the
same
money
that
was
seized
in
atlanta.
so
it's
a
continuation
of
the
effect
of
the
seizure.
you
can't
separate
them
cleanly.
and
the
affidavit--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--justice
kagan,
i
think
if
--
if
what
officer
walden
allegedly
had
done
--
of
course,
that's
not
this
case
--
is
freeze
a
bank
account
in
nevada,
then--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--no,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
the
question.
but
if
what
he
had
done
is
freeze
a
bank
account
in
nevada,
then
maybe
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
he
had
entered
into
nevada
by
freezing
the
bank
account
in
nevada.
but
here
the
cash
was
in
atlanta.
the
plaintiffs
brought
the
cash
to
atlanta.
officer
walden
didn't
seek
them
out
knowing
that
they
had
any
connection
to
nevada.
they
--
he
didn't
go
to
nevada.
he
didn't
direct
anyone
in
nevada
to
do
anything.
he
didn't
seize
a
--
or
freeze
a
bank
account
in
nevada
or
direct
anyone
to
do
anything
like
that.
he
never
had
any
contact
with
nevada
at
all
except
for
the
very
intangible
contact,
if
you
can
call
it
that,
of
--
of
allegedly
writing
this
affidavit
to
keep
the
plaintiffs
from
getting
the
money
back
sooner
than
they
would
have.
but
the
plaintiffs
would
have
gotten
the
money
back
wherever
they
happened
to
be
or
really,
more
precisely,
wherever
their
lawyer
happened
to
be.
the
fact
that
they
chose
a
lawyer
in
nevada
and
that's
where
asked
the
government
to
send
them
their
money
back
ultimately
is
the
very
definition
of
fortuitous
contact
between
walden
and
nevada.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
thank
you,
justice
sotomayor.
if
i
may,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
and,
as
you
suggested,
address
that
on
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
intentional
torts
being
different,
and
--
and
how
there
should
be
a
different
rule
in
intentional
torts.
and
i
want
to
start
just
by
--
by
emphasizing
the
implications
of
that.
the
other
side
is
putting
all
their
eggs
in
the
basket
of
what's
in
officer
walden's
mind,
triggering
some
different
personal
jurisdiction
inquiry.
and
my
friend
even
referred
to
qualified
immunity
by
analogy,
but
i
think
that
analogy
is
very
important.
and
it
shows
why
it
would
be
unworkable
to
make
personal
jurisdiction
turn
on
what's
allegedly
in
the
defendant's
mind.
this
court
initially
created
qualified
immunity
on
that
model
as
a
--
as
a
--
based
on
subjective
good
faith.
that
turned
out
not
to
work
because
subjective
good
faith--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
the
court
needs
to
address
internet
cases
or
any
other
cases
involving
modern
technology.
this
case
is
--
the
most
modern
technology
involved
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
a
dog
sniff
at
the
airport.
there's
just
no
reason
for
the
court
to
address
any
of
those--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
of
course,
justice
sotomayor.
i
understand
there
has
to
be
a
rule,
and
the
rule
is
here
there
is
--
there's
tangible
property.
this
isn't
a
case
about
property
with
no
real-world
presence
that
only
exists
on
a
server
somewhere.
this
is
a
case
about
cash
that
was
in
a
bag,
and
the
bag
was
in
atlanta,
on
the
plaintiff's
person
in
atlanta.
it
was
seized
in
atlanta.
and
the
only
effect--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
i
think
it's
not
contingent.
and
from
officer
walden's
perspective,
i
think
it's
incidental
and
contingent
that
the
plaintiffs
happened
to
be
from
nevada,
and
that's
where
the
effects
of
the
seizure
or
the
continued
seizure
or
the
delay
in
return
were
felt.
but
i
think
to
--
to
try
to
answer,
justice
sotomayor,
your
question
and
your
question
earlier
about
freezing
a
bank
account
in
other
kind
of
electronic
cases
or
internet
cases
where
different
technologies
are
involved,
maybe
there's
a
difference
between
freezing
a
bank
account
in
nevada.
maybe
that
can
be
said
to
be
something
that
occurs
in
nevada,
that's
reaching
into
nevada
to
cause
a
real
effect
in
nevada,
to
cause
something
to
happen
in
nevada,
which
is
different
from
seizing
cash
in
atlanta,
knowing
and
failing
to
return
it,
knowing
that
the
failure
to
return
it
is
going
to
have
an
impact
wherever
the
plaintiffs
are,
which
presumably
will
include
where
they
live,
which
is
nevada
and
california.
so
maybe
there's
a
way
to
draw
a
line
between
freezing
a
bank
account
in
nevada,
or
in
bancroft
and
masters
and
dudnikov,
the
cases
that
my
friend
relied
on,
there
were
real-world
activities
happening
in
the
forum
state.
in
dudnikov,
there
were
goods.
there
were
--
there
were
fabric
prints
that
existed
in
the
real
world.
and
they
were
being
--
they
were
in
colorado,
and
they
were
to
be
sold
in
colorado.
the
defendant--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
complaint
--
again,
we're
not
challenging
the
--
the
reading
by
the
lower
courts
that
there's
a
claim
based
on
the
affidavit
that's
distinct
from
the
claim
based
on
the
seizure.
on
the
other
hand,
the
complaint
only
has
a
fourth
amendment
claim
in
it.
that's
the
only
source
of
law
that
the
complaint
relies
on.
and
the
fourth
amendment
injury
was
complete
upon
the
seizure
--
upon
the
search
and
seizure
which
occurred
in
atlanta.
the
quantum
of
damages
wasn't
known
yet
at
that
time
because
the
plaintiffs
didn't
know
whether
they'd
get
the
money
back
or
when
or
what
might
happen
in
between.
but
that
fourth
amendment
injury
occurred
then
and
there.
and
so
the
fact
that
maybe
their
consequential
damages
are
higher
because
they
didn't
have
the
use
of
the
money
for
longer
as
opposed
to
shorter,
i
suppose
that
could
increase
their
damages.
but
it
doesn't
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
this
case
as
one
that
has
no
meaningful
connection
between
officer
walden's
conduct,
all
of
which
occurred
in
atlanta
and
--
and
nevada.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
i
think
judge
ikuda
made
that
point
below,
justice
scalia,
and
i
would
agree
with
that,
that
--
that
however
is
what
the
complaint
alleges,
and
we're
here
on
personal
jurisdiction
and
venue
and
not
on
the
merits
of
the
--
of
the
complaint.
so
again,
the
complaint
alleges
that
there's
this
affidavit
--
may
i
finish,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
the
complaint
alleges
that
there
is
this
affidavit
written
in
georgia
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
funds
that
were
seized
in
georgia
that
were
to
be
forfeited
in
georgia.
the
only
connection
to
nevada
is
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
allegedly
felt
the
impact
there.
under
any
of
this
court's
precedents,
that's
not
sufficient.
thank
you,
your
honors.
