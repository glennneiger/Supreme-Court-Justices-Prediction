justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
arises
in
nevada.
what
they're
saying
is
that
some
people
in
georgia
didn't
give
back
some
money
that
they
took
in
georgia.
to
take
your
example,
my
question
is
this:
there
could
--
you
say
there
are
many,
many,
many
cases.
we
could
get
this
all
mixed
up
if
we
don't
follow
your
rule.
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
cite
me
a
few,
but
the
few
that
i
want
you
to
cite
me
will
meet
certain
criteria.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
example,
a
college
student
goes
into
the
bookstore,
and
it's
also
a
pharmacy,
by
the
way.
and
he
breaks
his
finger
in
the
door.
it's
his
fault.
he
says:
i
am
going
home;
send
me
some
bandages.
the
store
never
does.
"send
me
some
books;
i
just
bought
them.
"
they
know
his
home
address,
all
right?
injury.
now,
what
about
those?
cite
me
some
lower
cases
where
they
say
there
is
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"oh,
i
lost
my
billfold.
"
"i
lost
it
here
in
the
store.
"
"when
you
find
it,
will
you
send
it
back?
"
they
never
send
it
back,
though
they
found
it.
all
right.
so
just
give
me
some
lower
court
cases
that
finds
jurisdiction
in
that
kind
of
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
the
injury
--
my
goodness,
he
lost
his
billfold.
there
was
money
in
it.
and
by
the
way,
when
he
gets
home,
his
parents
are
away,
and
he's
not
going
to
have
any
money
to
spend
on
food
or
even,
like,
cds
or
anything.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
those
cases
where
he
lost
his
billfold
in
the
bookstore
in
the
college
town
1,000
miles
away
from
home,
and
he's
going
home,
and
everybody
knows
he's
never
going
to
have
any
money,
and
they
keep
the
money.
okay.
what's
the
difference?
if
there
are
no
cases
on
those,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
yours?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
give
me
the
case
that
says
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
is
a
case
--
is
this
a
case
like
--
i'll
look
at
those
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
your
case
a
case
like
where
the
credit
card
is
used,
somebody
finds
it
in
a
bookstore
and
starts
spending
the
money
and
did
the
agents
here,
who
were
outside
nevada
and
they
were
keeping
the
money,
were
they
going
and
spending
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
a
credit
card
that
they
were
using?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
just
which
cases
i
should
read
carefully
and
i
will
read
those
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
there
seems
to
be
because
it's
hard
to
think
of
an
internet
case
where
a
defendant
wouldn't
be
having
communications
with
people
in
the
--
state,
wouldn't
be
inviting
business,
wouldn't
be
doing
all
kinds
of
things.
so
there
are
many
kinds
of
internet
cases,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
automatically
see
in
deciding
this
that
we're
deciding
any
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
do
that.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
--
what
are
the
elements
of
the
second
tort?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
is
the
element?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
other
element?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
find
that?
because
you
see
in
the
fraud
case,
the
element
includes
the
victims
being
misled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
not
necessarily
true
here.
i
wonder--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
has
to
be
a
misrepresentation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--material
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
material
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
here,
but
material
to
--
normally
it
has
to
be
material
to
the
obtaining
the,
say,
of
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
where
do
i
find
the
elements
of
the
tort
that
you
are
alleging
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
complaint
that
says
anything
like
that.
it
just
says
--
where
do
i
look
to
see
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
the
second
case,
no
element
of
the
crime
or
no
element
of
the
tort,
it's
only
the
injury
which
isn't
an
element
of
the
actual
underlying
behavior
that
gives
rise
to
and
in
the
first
case
it's
the
other.
there
is
an
element
that
takes
place
there.
that's
what
i'm
looking
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking
for
that.
i'm
not
saying
that
i
have
it.
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question
i
did.
