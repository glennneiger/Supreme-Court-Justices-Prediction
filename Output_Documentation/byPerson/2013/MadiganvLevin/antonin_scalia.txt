justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you're
correct
that
the
two
are
one
and
the
same,
how
--
how
is
it
that
we
have
authorized
district
courts
to
do
the
one
or
the
other?
we
--
we
have
not
required
district
courts
to
reach
the
merits
if
they're
--
if
they
can
resolve
the
question
on
the
basis
of
qualified
immunity
alone.
well,
how
can
that
be?
if
the
merits
are
necessarily
part
of
the
qualified
immunity
determination?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
--
maybe
you
better
say
a
few
words
about
the
merits?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
that's
not
what
the
seventh
circuit
held.
i
mean,
that
--
that
may
well
be,
but
we're
asked
to
review
a
holding
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
even
if
you
aren't
covered,
even
if
you're
not
exempt,
you
still
have
a
1983
claim.
that's
--
that's
why
we
took
this
case.
and
now
you're
--
you're
telling
us
we
should
not
review
what
the
seventh
circuit
held.
and
that
would
presumably
remain
the
circuit
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i'm
trying
to
--
trying
to
see
how
--
how
many
of
these
arguments
that
you
have
made
before
us
about
why
--
why
we
can't
get
to
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit,
how
many
of
them
you
made
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
i
mean,
we
--
we
don't
like
to
dismiss
a
case
as
improvidently
granted,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--only
when
the
--
when
the
case
is
before
us,
counsel
suddenly
finds
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
we
shouldn't
have
taken
it
in
the
first
place.
you
should
have
told
us
that
before
we
took
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
read
your
brief
in
opposition
as
--
as
going
exclusively
to
what
your
unfortunate
brother
barely
had
a
chance
to
argue;
that
is,
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
--
that's
what
your
brief
in
opposition
addressed,
and
here
we
end
up
spending
most
of
our
discussion
on
--
on
other
stuff.
i
don't
--
i
don't
like
to
encourage
that.
