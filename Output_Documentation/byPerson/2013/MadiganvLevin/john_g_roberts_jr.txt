justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
first
case
this
term
is
case
12-872,
madigan
v.
levin.
mr.
scodro?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
an
--
the
qualified
immunity
question
is
presented
on
interlocutory
appeal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
decisions
on
the
merits,
factual
and
legal,
are
still
pending.
now,
we
have
a
determination
by
the
district
court
that
mr.
levin
is
not
an
employee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
prior
district
court
determined
that
he
was.
the
respondent's
alleged
that
he
was
an
employee
in
their
complaint.
i
presume,
depending
on
how
we
rule
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
the
parties
may
want
to
revisit
their
positions
on
that
question
as
the
case
goes
go
forward.
and
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
i
suppose,
would
be
the
one
to
decide
whether
they're
allowed
to
revisit
the
issue
in
light
of
the
change
in
his
perception
of
the
law
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
theobald?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
said
the
exact
opposite
in
wilkie
in
footnote
4.
i
mean,
you
can
say
it's
only
a
footnote,
but
it
is
what
we
said.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
brother--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--who
just
sat
down
explained
that
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
didn't
consider
the
issue
that
you're
--
you're
talking
about
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
that
the
--
was
that
the
first
one
or
the
second
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
want
to
--
you
don't
want
to
give
it
up,
which
makes
sense.
i
mean,
you've
got
a
client.
it
depends
on
what
we
do,
right?
i
mean,
depending
on
what
our
ruling
is,
it
may
be
advantageous
to
you
to
argue,
as
you
alleged
in
your
complaint,
that
he's
an
employee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
to
get
this
clear,
you
asked
for
this
ruling
from
the
seventh
circuit.
and
--
and
you
won
based
on
a
factual
record
that
was
no
different
then
than
it
is
now.
you
asked
for
this
ruling
based
on
these
facts,
you
won,
and
now
you
want
to
insulate
that
from
the
new
review.
i
mean,
i
think
it'd
--
it'd
be
a
feather
in
your
cap
if
you
can
pull
it
off.
but
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
that
since
you
asked
for
the
ruling
on
the
merits
and
got
it,
we
ought
to
be
able
to
review
it
to
determine
whether
it's
right
or
wrong.
and
to
the
extent
there's
a
factual
issue
that
would
persist
in
the
case
if
it
goes
back
on
qualified
immunity,
you
and
the
parties
can
reposition
themselves
on
that.
i
mean,
it
is
an
issue
that
was
apparently
close
enough
for
one
district
court
to
say
yes,
the
other
district
court,
on
looking
at
it
again,
to
say
no.
the
deck
will
be
reshuffled
depending
on
how
we
rule.
and
as
i
see
you
standing
there,
i
don't
see
you
willing
to
concede
for
--
for
the
future
that
he's
not
an
employee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
i
assume
--
if
you're
saying
the
qualified
immunity
ruling
should
not
be
reviewed
because
this
person
was
not
an
employee,
but
instead
covered
by
gera,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
address
gera
in
the
preclusion
ruling,
right?
so
presumably,
they
get
another
--
they
get
a
chance
on
an
interlocutory
appeal;
the
whole
thing
is
--
qualified
immunity
is
supposed
to
protect
them
from
trial.
and
if
you
say
the
gera
issue
wasn't
--
wasn't
considered,
even
though
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
was
sweeping
and
didn't
distinguish,
well,
they
should
have
a
chance
to
assert
qualified
immunity
under
that
ground,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
even
though
they
--
you
had
that
reference
to
him
being
exempt,
the
seventh
circuit
basically
said
it
didn't
make
a
difference,
right?
whether
he
was
covered
as
--
as
an
employee
or
not
covered
or
covered
under
gera
or
anything
else,
under
their
analysis,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
scodro,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
