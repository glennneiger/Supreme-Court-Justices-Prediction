mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
jurisdictional
issue.
we
made
the
argument
before
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
--
on
this
issue
of
preclusion.
and
we
argued
that
under
swint,
the
court's
decision
in
swint,
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
qualified
immunity,
the
court
would
have
to
reach
the
--
in
order
to
reach
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity,
it
would
have
to
address
the
preclusion
issue.
and
our
position
was
you
don't
have
to
look
at
--
you
don't
even
consider
that
on
qualified
immunity.
it's
not
part
of
the
equation.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
we
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
and
we
made
that
argument
and
in
the
decision
that
the
seventh
circuit
reached
they
said:
we
didn't
have
to
consider
this
preclusion
issue
to
reach
the
qualified
immunity
denial,
that
qualified
immunity
was
not
applicable.
so
we
did
argue
that
and
that
was
our
position
there.
with
respect
to
the
issue
presented
here,
the
only
thing
that
is
pertinent
is
whether
or
not
the
adea
can
preclude
an
individual
who's
not
covered
by
it,
regardless
if
that
individual
is
under
40
years
old
or
if
they're
exempt
from
the
statute
or
if
they
have
a
claim
that
the
adea
doesn't
address.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
we
--
the
seventh
circuit
--
we
made
it
clear
in
the
seventh
circuit
that
mr.
levin
had
been
excluded.
he
was
excluded
in
july
of
2011
by
a
decision
of
district
court
chang.
he
said
in
that--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--the
second
one.
judge
korr
initially
decided
the
issue
twice
and
said
mr.
levin
was
covered
by
the
adea.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
i
concede
that
there's
no
realistic
possibility.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
i
--
i
mean,
they
dodged
--
he's
--
the
court
has
ruled,
the
seventh
circuit
in
opp
v.
cook
county
state's
attorney,
your
honor,
made
it
very
clear
their
state's
attorneys
would
be
--
appointees
would
not
be
covered
under
the
adea.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--well,
the
court
will
so
rule.
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
in
the
opp
v.
cook
county
case
and
this
court
denied
cert
in
2011
on
the
opp
v.
cook
county
case.
but
to
stand
here--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--well,
as
we
stand
here
now,
he
is
not
in
this
case.
and
i
--
i
don't
know--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--okay.
well,
going
back
to
mr.
levin
being
not
covered,
we
believe
the
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
passman
and
the
court's
decision
in
smith
v.
robinson,
which
is
the
only
case
where
the
court
has
precluded
a
1983
constitutional
claim,
that
that--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--well,
we
think
the
difference
was
after
the
district
court's
decision
in
our
case,
that
the
seventh
circuit
decided
another
case
in
2010.
and
that's
why
the
second
district
court
judge
followed
that
precedent.
and
that
precedent,
where
this
court
denied
cert,
there's
no
real
possibility
that
any
court
is
going
to
find
mr.
levin
as
being
covered
by
the
adea.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
gera
is
--
is
another--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
it
is
unclear,
your
honor.
we
don't
--
gera
is
unclear
whether,
first
of
all,
in
the
alaska
case
v.
eeoc,
whether
it
applies
to
states.
states
have
argued
that
they're
not
included
in
the
definition
--
definition
of
gera.
and
the
state
of
illinois
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
under
the
gera
statute.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
so
whether
or
not
there's
a
remedy
there
is
very
unclear.
and
this
--
as
justice
breyer
mentioned,
it's
been
never
discussed
in
this
case.
it
was
never
discussed
in
the
seventh
circuit,
never
discussed
in
the
district
court.
it
wasn't
discussed
at
the
eeoc.
when
we
filed
a
charge,
the
attorney
general
didn't
come
in
and
say
this
should
be
handled
under
gera.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
our
position
was
it
was
inapplicable.
we
didn't
--
we
wouldn't
raise
it.
it
would
be
--
someone
else
would
raise
it.
there's
about
a
handful
of
cases
nationally
that
are
filed
under
gera
every
year.
some
years,
there's
no
cases
filed
at
the
eeoc.
it's
seldom
used.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
--
our
position
is
we
didn't
argue
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
our
brief,
but
the
court
was
concerned
about
it
and
we
did
address
it
in
the
seventh
circuit.
i
would
point
out,
in
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
though,
their
decision
throughout
the
--
for
instance,
the
--
the
seventh
circuit
talks
about
mr.
levin
not
being
an
appointee
on
the
policymaking
level
and
exempt,
so
that
was
in
the
case.
it
wasn't
something
where
they
just
decided
whether
the
adea
precludes
individuals
that
are
covered.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
there's
no
preclusion
under
gera
or
the
adea.
we've
set
forth
that
the
court
should
look
at
preclusion
with
two
questions:
the
first
question
under
preclusion
is
under
sea
clammers.
sea
clammers
was
a
case
where
they
passed
a
new
statute
with
the
new
right
and
had
an
enforcement
provision
in
the
statute,
and
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
under
sea
clammers
the
congress
intended
to
preclude
1983
to
enforce
that
statute.
and
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion,
yes,
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
use
1983
with
that
statute.
the
second
standard
that
the
court
has
used
is
under
smith
v.
fitzgerald,
which
is
applicable
here,
if
we're
looking
at
whether
the
adea
precludes
somebody
covered
by
the
adea.
and
that
is,
when
a
statute
is
passed
with
an
enforcement
provision,
did
congress
intend
to
use
that
enforcement
provision
to
also
enforce
preexisting
independent
statutory
or
constitutional
rights?
and,
two,
did
congress
intend
to
use
this
provision
in
the
new
statute
to
be
the
sole
exclusive
remedy
of
the
preexisting
independent
constitutional
right?
gera
cannot
preclude
a
constitutional
--
gera
--
there's
no
evidence
that
when
congress
passed
gera
they
intended
gera
to
enforce
the
constitutional
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
law.
it
doesn't--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
we
can
see
where
the
rational
basis
test
--
the
court
found
we
survived
summary
judgment
on
our
equal
protection
gender
discrimination
claim
and
the
age
discrimination
claim.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
we're
all
in
trouble.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
i
don't
believe
so.
this
court
has
considered
that
issue
on
two
occasions.
in
gregory
v.
ashcroft
that
was
before
the
court.
it
was
a
--
the
plaintiffs
were
excluded,
like
mr.
levin,
and
yet
this
court
acknowledged
the
equal
protection
1983
claim.
they
didn't
--
the
reasons
that
were
used
in
that
case
were
insufficient
to
meet
the
rational
basis
test.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
gera
has
never
been
--
there's
one
case
on
gera
that
we
could
find.
it's
over
a
20-year-old
district
court
of
new
york
decision
that
said
gera
can't
preclude
anything.
so
if
we
put
gera
together
with
the
adea,
it's
only
been
really
one
district
court
has
addressed
that
issue.
and--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--if
you
had
a
claim
under
1983,
it
would
also,
i
believe,
violate
the
adea.
if
that
--
if
i
--
if
that's
your
question.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
it
would
be--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--be
very
unfair
to
us,
your
honor.
we
were
scheduled
to
go
to
trial
in
may
before
the
court
granted
its
cert.
the
case
has
been
pending
almost
six
years.
and
to
raise
this
issue
at
this
--
this
issue
in
gera
was
raised
this
year.
it
wasn't
raised
for
six
years.
never
--
whenever
it
was
part
of
this
case.
and
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--well,
for
something
that's
as
suspect
as
gera
whether
it
even
applies,
it's
--
the
state
has
not
said
it
applies--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
our
position
is
that,
yes,
that
none
of
these
apply.
adea
cannot
preclude
somebody
that's
covered.
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
covers
that.
the
adea
can't
preclude
somebody
that's
not
covered.
and
this
court's
opinion
in
davis
v.
passman
and
footnote
22
in
smith
v.
robinson
talks
about--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--yes.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes,
he's
been
excluded.
i--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--we
don't
agree
that
he's
covered
by
gera,
but
it's
--
it's
not
clear.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
i
don't
think
that
would
factor
in,
your
honor,
with
the
qualified
immunity
analysis.
the
seventh
circuit
held
and
the
district
court
held
that
your
decision
in
kimel
acknowledged
equal
protection
1983
claims,
and
that's
the
issue
in
qualified
immunity.
they
have
not
asked
this
court
to
review
the
qualified
immunity
aspect
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
just
the
preclusion
part.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
it's
the
latter,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
the
district
court
did
so
hold,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
i
think
it
answered
both
questions,
really.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
the
difference.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
the
court's
--
the
district
court's
decision
held
no
qualified
immunity.
the
seventh
circuit
cited
this
court's
decision
in
kimel.
the
other
cases
before
this
court,
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
acknowledged
an
age
discrimination
case
brought
through
1983
and
it
was
clearly
established.
the
seventh
circuit
acknowledged
the
1983
age
discrimination
equal
protection
claim
in
1977
in
gault
v.
garrison.
this
is
a
well-settled
issue.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
well,
if
the
facts
that
the
officer
was
presented,
if
there
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
well
settled
that
the
conduct--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
so
on
the
people
that
aren't
covered,
we
have
four
groups:
people
that
are
under
40
under
the
adea;
people
in
the
--
that
are
exempt;
individuals
that
work
for
a
government
employer
that
have
less
than
20
employees
are
not
covered
by
the
adea;
and
people
that
have
a
particular
type
of
claim,
a
retaliation
claim,
a
claim
for
emotional
distress
damages,
something
like
that,
they're
not
covered.
the
state
concedes
that
the
people
under
40,
they're
going
to
bring
equal
protection
claims
through
1983.
there's
no
difference
between
those
people
and
mr.
levin
and
the
other
two
categories.
you're
either
in
or
you're
out.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
yes,
that
--
that
is
true.
but
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
opinion,
and
i
could
just
refer
to
things
in
the
appendix
at
page
57a.
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
district
court
said
mr.
levin
is
exempt.
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
the
seventh
circuit
docket
no.
44
talks
about
end-runs.
the
seventh
circuit
docket
no.
37,
page
67,
the
plaintiff
was
an
employee
on
the
policymaking
level.
so
it's
clear
that
the
seventh
circuit
knew
we
argued
that
he
was
exempt.
we
argued
that
the
--
being
exempt
under
the
district
court's
decision
in
fitzgerald
gives
an
individual
the
right
to
bring
an
equal
protection
claim.
and
the
court
mentioned
that
in
fitzgerald,
the
decision
in
2009,
being
exempt
from
title
ix.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
i
think
we
could
read
the
opinion
that
way,
but
they
certainly
were
aware
that
mr.
levin
was
not
covered.
the
--
the
state
has
argued
since
mr.
levin
has
been
excluded
before
the
seventh
circuit
and
before
this
court,
they
used
the
terms
“
exhaustion
”,
“
not
exhausting
remedies
”,
and
they
used
the
word
“
avoids
the
scheme
”,
“
they
avoid
the
adea
”.
in
the
opening
brief
before
--
the
merits
brief
before
this
court,
the
state
used
the
term
“
exhaustion
”
or
“
failure
to
exhaust
”
more
than
a
dozen
times.
they
used
the
term
“
avoiding
the
adea
”
at
least
six
times.
this
argument
is
the
old
zombro
argument,
the
first
case
that
held
preclusion
where
somebody
didn't
go
through.
exhaustion
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
this
court's
opinion
in
patsy
v.
board
of
regents
said
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
from
1983.
all
the
cases,
johnson
v.
railway
express,
cbocs
v.
humphries,
there's
no
exhaustion
required.
and
to
top
it
off,
mr.
levin,
he
exhausted
his
remedies.
he
filed
at
the
eeoc.
he
got
a
right
to
sue
under
title
vii.
so--
mr.
edward
r.
theobald
iii
--we
believe,
your
honor,
that
those
two
cases
are
the
second
standard.
the
smith
--
we
agree
with
the
standard
in
smith.
we
agree
in
the
standard
with
fitzgerald.
and
the
standard
in
smith,
what
that
case
was
about
was
the
educational
for
all
handicapped
act,
whether
that
act
precluded
the
use
of
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
statutory
claim,
and
whether
it
precluded
1983
constitutional
claims.
and
the
court
in
smith
v.
fitzgerald
said
that
it
did,
because
there
was
no
--
the
eha,
the
remedies
and
the
procedures
there
was
not
for
a
de
novo
review
in
court.
so
the
plaintiff's
claim
was
precluded.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
smith
standard.
but
the
court
also
said
in
smith
that
if
there
are
matters
that
are
offered
to
the
children,
the
disability
of
the
disabled
children
or
their
parents
under
the
eha
that
that
doesn't
cover,
those
things,
if
they're
offered
to
parents
and
if
they're
offered
in
a
discriminatory
matter
or
denied
for
discrimination,
those
claims
can
be
brought
under
the
1983
equal
protection
claims
or
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
preexisting
statutory
claim.
so
applying
that
to
the
ada,
there
is
no
evidence
that
in
passing
the
ada
for
covered
individuals
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
the
preexisting
1983
equal
protection
claim.
so
our
second
standard
in
our
brief
is
the
smith-fitzgerald
standard.
in
fitzgerald,
the
court
went
further
and
explained
if
the
rights
and
protections
of
the
statute
that
is
seeking
precluding
are
different
than
the
equal
protection
claim,
then
there
is
no
preclusion.
and
here,
the
rights
and
protections
between
the
ada
and
the
equal
protection
through
1983
are
vast,
are
vast.
there's
different
parties,
different
defendants.
in
the
adea
the
entity
is
the
defendant.
in
equal
protection
1983
it's
individual.
in
the
adea,
all
these
exemptions
of
people
that
aren't
covered;
if
somebody
pursues
a
1983
equal
protection
claim,
there
is
no
exemptions
of
individuals.
so
to
conclude,
your
honor,
we
adopt
the
smith
standard.
we
have
no
problem
with
smith.

mr.
edward

--we
could
have
done
a
better
job
--
we
could
have
done
a
better
job,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
we
did
try
to
point
out
that
mr.
levin
was
exempt.
we
did
say
that
and
how
under
fitzgerald
the
exemptions
formed
the
basis
of
an
equal
protection
claim.
mr.
edward
r.
theobald

we
could
have
done
a
better
job.
thank
you.
