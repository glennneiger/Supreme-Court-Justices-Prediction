justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
a
few
things
i
--
i
don't
really
know.
i
mean,
does
--
do
you
have
to
allege
a
claim
under
gera
for
this
particular
individual?
i
don't
know.
and
if
you
do,
i
don't
know
whether
gera
simply
picked
up
whatever
saving
of
the
equal
protection
otherwise
would
have
existed
in
the
adea
or
didn't.
and
i
believe
that
gera
applies
to
employment
discrimination
claims
based
on
gender
or
race
or
other
things,
right?
well,
every
circuit
in
the
country
has
said
you
don't
lose
your
--
your
constitutional
claim
there.
so
are
we
supposed
to
read
gera,
it
goes
this
way
in
some
cases
and
that
way
in
other
cases,
when
gera
is
silent
on
the
matter?
and
so
i
looked
to
see
what
the
seventh
circuit
said.
nothing.
i
looked
to
see
what
you
argued
below.
i
looked
to
see
whether
it's
obvious
that
gera
does
apply
or
doesn't
apply
and
simply
picks
it
up
or
not.
maybe
i'm
just
being
thick.
but
nonetheless,
where
i
don't
know
so
much
and
the
whole
case
turns
on
it,
why
are
we
hearing
an
issue
that
might
not
even
be
in
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
about
people
not
like
the
client
who's
at
issue
here.
that
is
about
people
whom
the
adea
did
cover.
isn't
that
an
advisory
opinion
in
respect
to
this
case?
i
don't
know.
that
has
a
certain
ring
to
it.
but
--
but
what
are
we
doing,
deciding
whether
the
adea
applies
and
in
what
way
to
a
person
to
whom
it
doesn't
apply,
assuming
that
gera
is
in
fact
a
separate
statute
that
you
have
to
sue
under,
the
answer
to
which
i
do
not
know
and
which
has
never
been
argued.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
if
there's
so
little
about
it,
sometime
on
occasion
we
dismiss
a
case
as
improvidently
granted,
which
is
not
a
particularly
desirable
thing
to
do.
but
how
could
we
avoid
doing
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
pretty
universal
he's
not
an
employee
under
adea,
though
he
might
be
under
gera.
you
have
to
say
yes
or
no,
because
if
you're
going
to
say
--
i
mean,
you
know,
let's
either
do
it
or
not
do
it.
if
you
--
if
you
want
to
leave
this
issue
in
the
case,
it's
possible
to
argue
we
should
decide
this
whole
issue
on
the
ground
that
although
he's
not
really
a
bird,
he's
a
fish
or
whatever.
but
i
mean,
this
is
supposed
to
be
fairly
realistic,
i
think,
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
no
real
possibility
that
any
court
is
going
to
find
that
your
client
was,
in
fact,
an
employee
without
gera.
that's
what
you
said;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
different
statute.
but
just
without
gera,
he's
a
political
appointment
or
whatever
it
is,
so
he's
not
within
adea.
that's
what
i
think
this
is
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
agree
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
thank
you
very
much.
and
then
my
argument
comes
into
play
that
we
shouldn't
be
deciding
issues
of
an
advisory
nature
that
do
not
involve
individuals
who
fall
within
the
statute
that
someone
once
interpreted.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
doing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
if
the
--
is
there
anything
unfair
about
this?
i
think
justice
ginsburg
wrote
an
opinion
in
--
i
recall
a
third
circuit
case
involving
erisa
or
some
medical
thing,
and
an
issue
came
up
that
was
quite
relevant
and
nobody
had
really
thought
about
it
before
or
done
much
about
it.
and
what
she
wrote,
to
my
recollection,
is:
well,
we
would
like
the
advice
of
the
lower
court
if
they
want
to
give
it.
and
so
we
send
it
back
for
the
third
circuit
to
consider
whether
it's
appropriate
to
reach
the
issue,
and
if
it
is
appropriate
to
reach
the
issue,
do
so.
or
if
they
think
the
district
court
should
reach
it,
do
so.
in
other
words,
we
can't
figure
it
out
at
this
moment
what's
fair
in
terms
of
the
entire
litigation.
now,
would
that
--
would
that
be
a
serious
problem
for
you
or
your
client?
