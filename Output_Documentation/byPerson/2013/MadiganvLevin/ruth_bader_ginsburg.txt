mr.
scodro,
there's
a
preliminary
question
before
we
get
to
the
question
you
presented,
and
that
is:
what
authority
did
the
seventh
circuit
have
to
deal
with
the
question
under
the
age
discrimination
act?
i
mean,
it
was
--
it
went
to
the
seventh
circuit
on
interlocutory
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
qualified
immunity
question.
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
no
qualified
immunity.
that
there
--
that
there
is
indeed
a
claim
that
the
equal
protection
clause
includes
age.
so
second
--
seventh
circuit
had
no
authority
to
deal
with
any
question
other
than
that,
did
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
wilkie,
the
whole
case
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court,
wasn't
it?
so
whatever
was
said
in
that
footnote
was
dicta.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
running
up
against
the
seventh
circuit
in
that
respect
because
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
existence
of
an
--
whether
adea
was
the
exclusive
remedy,
that
that
was
irrelevant
to
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
decision
was
that
there
was
no
qualified
immunity.
and
the
question
is:
having
determined
there
was
no
qualified
immunity,
should
they
have
stopped
there?
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
trial
--
if
there
is
no
qualified
immunity
and
they
have
no
exemption
from
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
another
preliminary
question,
and
that
is,
why
are
we
talking
about
the
adea
when
the
district
court
held
that
the
adea
doesn't
cover
mr.
levin.
and
there
seems
to
be
not
much
of
a
dispute
about
that.
you're
not
arguing
that
the
adea
does
cover
him,
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
as
far
as
the
--
the
preclusion
is
concerned,
why
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
it's
adea
or
gera?
wouldn't
the
arguable
preclusion
be
even
stronger
under
--
under
gera,
because
there
is
a
special
administrative
remedy,
you
have
to
go
to
the
eeoc
first,
and
the
only
form
for
review
is
the
federal
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
assume
that
the
question
that
was
presented
is
before
us.
and
you
--
you
have
argued
fitzgerald.
the
other
side
says
smith
v.
robinson
should
control.
so
why
shouldn't
the
handicapped
act
decision
control?
that,
like
the
adea,
has
allowed
procedural
parts
that
wouldn't
be
included
in
an
equal
protection
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
we
--
if
the
adea
is
expanding
the
civil
rights
protection
against
age
discrimination
much
more
generous
to
the
employee,
isn't
it
strange
to
think
that
congress
at
the
same
time
wanted
employees
to
have
these
expanded
rights
and
to
do
away
with
the
preexisting
remedies?
