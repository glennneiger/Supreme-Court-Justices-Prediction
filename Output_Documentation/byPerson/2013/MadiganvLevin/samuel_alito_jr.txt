justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
we
have
an
amicus
brief
from
law
professors
who
argue
that
the
seventh
circuit
should
not
have
considered
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983.
but
they
also
go
on
to
argue
that
we,
nevertheless,
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
that
question,
and
that
it
is
a
--
a
matter
of
discretion
for
us
to
decide
whether
to
do
that.
is
that
--
do
you
agree
with
that
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
could
not
be
considered
in
an
interlocutory
qualified
immunity
appeal,
what
would
the
effect
be
on
the
defendant's
right
not
to
be
tried,
which
is
the
whole
reason
for
allowing
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
qualified
immunity
cases?
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
if
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
qualified
immunity,
then
the
case
would
have
to
be
tried.
and
only
at
the
end
of
the
case
could
it
be
determined
whether
there
actually
was
a
cause
of
action.
so
you
have
a
trial
potentially
about
nothing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
has
the
court
ever
held
that
an
antidiscrimination
statute
that
does
not
provide
any
rights
for
a
particular
class
of
plaintiffs
nevertheless
extinguishes
the
right
of
action
that
those
plaintiffs
would
have
under
section
1983?
what
if
mr.
levin
were
under
40
years
old?
would
you
say
that
his
equal
protection
section
1983
cause
of
action
was
extinguished
by
the
adea?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
is
the
difference
between
someone
who's
under
40
and
someone
who
is
not
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
adea?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
should
we
consider
that
question?
if
this
--
if
we
were
back
in
the
era
before
the
enactment
of
the
gera,
yes,
we
would
have
to
consider
that
question.
but
now
that
the
new
statute
has
been
passed,
why
should
we
consider
whether
someone
who
was
a
non-employee
lacked
a
--
a
1983
cause
of
action
during
the
period
when
that
--
prior
to
the
enactment
of
that
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
your
brief,
could
i
just
--
you
say
--
i
think
this
is
pretty
close
to
the
exact
words:
there's
no
realistic
possibility
of
your
obtaining
a
holding
that
mr.
levin
is
an
employee
within
the
adea.
but
do
you
concede
that
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no.
do
you
concede
that
he
is
not
an
employee?
if
you
just
say
that
there's
no
realistic
possibility
that
the
courts
are
going
to
take
this
correct
position,
then
the
issue
is
still
in
the
case.
so
is
it
your
position
that
he
is
an
employee
or
he
is
not
an
employee?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you're
not
willing
to
say
that
he
is
not
an
employee,
then
the
issue
is
still
in
the
case,
and
we
would
have
--
if
we
were
to
rule
on
the
adea
issue,
wouldn't
we
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
remedy
for
somebody
who
is
an
employee
within
the
adea?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
district
court
might
be
wrong
on
that.
the
seventh
circuit
might
be
wrong
on
that.
and
you
may
be
right.
there's
not
much
of
a
realistic
possibility
that
you're
going
to
get
a
reversal
of
that.
but
the
issue
is
still
in
the
case
unless
you
want
to
give
it
up.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
want
us
to
hold
that
the
seventh
circuit
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1983.
so
that
precedent,
that
seventh
circuit
precedent,
would
be
wedged
from
the
books.
the
issue
would
be
back
in
the
case.
if
ultimately
there
was
another
appeal,
maybe
it
would
go
to
a
different
seventh
circuit
panel.
maybe
it
would
come
out
differently.
so
you
want
that
wiped
away.
and
you
want
us
to
hold
only
--
to
limit
our
consideration
to
the
adea
and
not
consider
gera,
so
that
would
be
back
in
the
case
when
it
came
--
when
it
went
back
to
the
district
court.
so
that's
correct?
that's
what
you
want?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
constitutional
right?
do
you
agree
that
the
standard
for
an
equal
protection
age-discrimination
claim
is
traditional,
full-blown,
rational-basis
review?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
that
if
there's
any
conceivable
ground
on
which
the
decisionmaker
could
have
decided
that
age
was
--
it
was
proper
to
make
an
age
classification,
there
is
no
constitutional
violation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
equal
protection
age
discrimination.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
if
the
illinois
legislature
passed
a
statute
that
said:
now,
forget
about
the
adea.
there
is
no
adea.
there
is
no
state
anti-discrimination
law
involved
here.
all
we
are
talking
about
is
equal
protection.
and
they
passed
a
law
that
said:
all
attorneys
working
for
the
state
of
illinois
must
retire
at
the
age
of
60,
because
everybody
knows,
you
know,
once
a
lawyer
passes
60,
there's
nothing
left.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
that
be
--
would
that
survive
a
rational
basis
review?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
true,
but
is
that
the
issue?
is
that
really
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
whether
irrational
age
discrimination
violates
equal
protection?
or
is
the
qualified
immunity
issue
whether,
on
the
facts
here,
an
official
could
believe
that
there
was
no
constitutional
violation,
reasonably
believe
there
was
no
constitutional
violation?
isn't
the
latter--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
the
latter
the
real
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
not
what
the
district
court
held
though,
is
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
district
court
simply
held
that
an
official
should
have
realized
that
irrational
age
discrimination
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
not
that
an
official
should
have
realized
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
do
what
was
alleged
to
have
been
done
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
see
the
difference
between
the
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
there's
a
qualified
immunity
appeal
on
the
question
--
on
the
issue
of
whether,
let's
say,
a
search
was
an
unreasonable
search,
would
qualified
immunity
be
denied
on
the
ground
that
an
official
should
realize
that
an
unreasonable
search
is
unconstitutional?
would
that
be
--
would
that
be
the
issue
under
qualified
immunity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
ah,
on
the
facts
that
were
presented.
