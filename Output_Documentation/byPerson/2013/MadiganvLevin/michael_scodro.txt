mr.
michael
a.
scodro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
has
crafted
a
comprehensive
body
of
administrative
and
judicial
procedures
and
remedies
that
are
tailored
specifically
to
combatting
discrimination
against
older
workers.
in
extending
these
procedures
and
remedies
to
government
employees,
congress
did
not
intend
to
permit
state
and
municipal
workers
alone
to
frustrate
this
regime
or
bypass
it
entirely
using
the
more
general
remedies
of
section
1983.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
it
did,
your
honor.
the
seventh
circuit
properly
followed
this
court's
holding
in
wilkie.
in
footnote
--
in
footnote
4
of
that
opinion,
the
court
concluded
correctly
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
bivens
action
for
a
recognized,
in
that
case,
due
process
violation,
was
itself
part
and
parcel
of
the
first
prong
of
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry
and,
therefore,
properly
considered
on
interlocutory--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--your
honor,
there's
an
argument
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
the
--
there
was
an
alternative
route
under
1254
in
wilkie
and
--
and,
therefore,
the
argument
is
raised
that
it
was
dicta.
but
it
wasn't
dicta
in
context,
your
honor.
the
court
didn't
consider
that
alternative
route.
the
court
squarely
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction,
and
it
goes
on
to
say
in
the
footnote
that
the
appellate
court
properly
exercised
jurisdiction
because
the
question
of
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
bivens
action
for
this
constitutional
right
is
properly
considered
part
of
the
qi.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
we
do
agree
with
that
position.
they
cite
clinton
versus
jones
and
they
cite
the
fitzgerald
decision
for
that
position,
your
honor.
and
we
would
agree
that
while
those
may
be
modest
extensions
of
the
holdings
in
those
cases,
we
would
agree
that
this
court
can
exercise
2254
jurisdiction
over
the
question.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
well,
i
think
that
--
no,
i
think
the
court
would
still
fairly
consider
the
--
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
on
the
issue,
your
honor.
and,
again,
i
would
--
i
would
return
to--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--well--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--the
theory
advanced
in
the
amicus
brief,
with
which
we
confer,
that
1254
grants
the
court
jurisdiction
over
the
case
and
that
would
include
issues
like
this
that
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
case
before
the
appellate
court.
now,
i
should
note
that
that
amicus
brief
begins
with
the
false
premise
that
there
was
an
exercise
of
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
and
as
we
explained
briefly
in
our
reply
brief,
the
one
reference,
the
sole
reference
to
pendent
appellate
jurisdiction
on
page
7-a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
is
merely
a
reference
or
a
brief
description
of
the
failed
argument
advanced
by
the
respondent
that
pendent
jurisdiction
would
not
be
a
proper
proceeding
here.
and
the
court
did
not
advance.
they
squarely
cited
wilkie
and
advanced
along
the--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--sure.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
well,
your
honor,
the
court
in
wilkie
moved
from
one
to
the
other
in
the
footnote.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--sure--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--because
a
--
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
itself
arises
out
of
section
1983
in
bivens,
it
would
seem
sensible
as
a
matter
of
first
principles
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
is
such
a
cause
of
action
at
all
at
the
outset
with
the
right
to
interlocutory
appeal,
rather
than
given
the
qualified
immunity
as
defense
from
litigation
is
not
just
judgment.
rather
than
waiting
until
final
judgment
and
on
a
1291
appeal,
then
addressing
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
i
think
--
and
i
want
to
be
clear.
i
think
there
are
two
different
rationales
here.
when
discussing
why
wilkie
was
correct
in
what
it
said
in
footnote
4,
i
would
submit
my
most
recent
answer,
namely,
that
it's
part
and
--
it
is
--
not
part
and
parcel,
but
it
is
natural
and
rational
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
cause
of
action
exists
at
the
outset.
with
regard
to--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--well,
your
honor,
some
of
the
merits
we
know
are
part
of
it
under
the
court's
decision
in
hartman
where
the
court
concluded
that
the
absence
of
the
failure
to
properly
plead
an
element
is,
indeed,
properly
considered
a
part
of
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry.
and
here,
the
--
what
wilkie
did
essentially,
as
i
read
it,
is
essentially
add
to
that
line
of
cases
the
idea
that
the
presence
or
not
of
the
bivens
action
in
that
case,
but
logically
speaking,
the
section
1983
action
here
would
be
--
would
be
appropriately
considered
as
part
of
the
--
the
first
prong
of
the
traditional
two-prong
qualified
immunity.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
toward
the
end
of
the
court's
opinion,
it's
true,
the
court
uses
the
phrase
that
"it's
irrelevant
to
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry.
"
in
that
context,
i
would
submit
the
court
is
using
the
phrase
“
qualified
immunity
”,
and
i
think
this
is
clear
in
context,
to
refer
as
--
as
lower
courts
have
at
times
done
to
the
second
prong;
that
is,
the
clearly
established
element
of
qualified
immunity.
earlier
in
the
opinion,
in
the
section
labeled
“
jurisdiction
”,
the
court
actually
cites
wilkie
and
makes
clear
that
it's
following
wilkie's
command
that
the
presence
or
not
of
the
section
1983
action
for
recognized
constitutional
right
is
considered
part
of
the
first
prong.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
my
earlier
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
i
think
there
--
or
justice
kagan's
question
--
i
apologize
--
i
think
it
was
--
that's
exactly
right.
this
is
immunity
from
litigation,
immunity
from
suit.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
no,
your
honor.
to
decide
that
there
isn't
qualified
immunity,
the
court
needs
to
consider
both
prongs
and
resolve
them
both
adverse
to
the
defendant.
and
therefore,
it
was
essential
for
the
court
here
to
consider
the
argument
that
there
is
no
section
1983
action.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
correct.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
with
regard
to
that
question,
i
would
return
to
the
notion
that
is
a
matter
of
first
principles,
given
that
qualified
immunity
is
an
outgrowth
of
section
1983.
the
court
was
very
just
--
was
justified
in
wilkie
in
treating
the
presence
or
not
of
the
cause
of
action.
this
is
a
--
we're
not
talking
about
an
affirmative
defense,
for
example,
in
the
form
of
statute
of
limitations
as
one
example.
we're
talking
about
the
existence
or
not
of
the
bivens
right
in
that
case,
in
the
section
1983
right
here.
it
seems
consistent
with
the
fact
that
qualified
immunity
exists
as
a
defense
against
section
1983
and
bivens
to
contemplate
the
existence
or
not
of
that
cause
of
action
right
at
the
threshold.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
adea's
remedial
regime
has
the
two
elements
that
this
court
has
looked
at
repeatedly
in
determining
whether
a
comprehensive
regime
or
a
regime
is
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
displace
more
general
section
1983.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
well,
we
are
--
we
are
arguing
that
the
adea's
rights
and
remedies
do
apply
to
mr.
levin.
and
the
reason
is
that
in
1991,
with
the
amendments
as
part
of
the
civil
rights
overhaul
act
that
year,
the
amendments
in
that
act
extended,
and
it's
a
section
entitled
"coverage
of
previously
exempt
state
employees.
"
it
--
it
extended
adea
rights
and
remedies
to
the
previously
exempt
policymakers
at
other
high
levels.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
no,
we
would
not,
your
honor.
and
the
reason--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--sure.
and
again,
we're
talking
about
the
1974
to
1991
period,
just
to
be
clear,
because
since
'91
appointees
and
employees
alike
are
--
have
the
full
range
of
adea
rights
and
remedies.
during
that
period,
under
40s,
as
this
court
held
in
cline,
that
workers
under
the
age
of
40
simply
were
not
part
of
the
social
ill
that
congress
aimed
to
redress.
they
were
concerned
with
the
plight
of
the
relatively
older
worker.
it's
why
the
court
concluded
in
cline
that
reverse
discrimination
is
not
covered
and
also
the
explanation
for
why
congress
drew
a
line
at
age
40.
just
as
in
smith,
for
example,
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
didn't
extend
to
cover
all
manner
of
hurdles
confronted
by
a
disabled
student,
it
--
it
focused
solely
on
a
singular
issue
facing,
a
curricular
issue
facing
these
students.
undoubtedly,
those
students
not
covered
by
it
would
have
retained
their
section
1983
right.
same
with
under-40
here.
now,
as
to
the
--
the
narrow
exception
that
existed
between
'74
and
'91
for
high-level
government
policymakers,
we
have
the
eeoc's
understanding
of
why
exactly
congress
did
that.
they
did
so
because
there
was
concern
on
the
part
of
members
of
congress
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
from
a
matter
of
federalism
and
operationally
to
have
federal
involvement
in
the
hiring
decisions
made
by
the
highest
members,
the
elected
members
of
state
and
local
government.
and
that
concern
applies
equally
to
section
1983
claims.
because
that
concern
applies
equally
--
we're
not
talking
about
people
who
weren't
within
the
scope
of
the
social
ill;
we're
talking
about
a
deliberate
carveout
for
reasons
that
apply
equally
to
section
1983
--
we
would
submit
that
the
exception
likewise
would
have
had
force
during
that
interim
period.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
you're
actually
--
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
confront
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
the
question
of
whether
or
not
between
1974
and
1991
exempt
employees,
those
who
then
obtained
adea
rights
in
1991,
whether
those
employees
could
be
--
their
section
1983
claims
could
have
been
displaced
by
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
were
carved
out.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
as
we
explain
in
reply
and
in
our
opening
brief,
the
gera
is
properly
considered
merely
a
part
of
the
broader
remedial
regime
under
the
adea.
and
we
explain
why
to
look
at
it
otherwise
would
create
all
sort
of
manner
of
artificialities.
it's
--
it's
--
we
know
from
past
statutes
like
the
genetics
act
that
was
passed
more
recently
the
way
in
which
congress
would
incorporate
gera
by
reference
instead
of
vice
versa.
we
know
that,
for
example,
in
that
same
1991
act,
1981(a)
was
added
and
provided
punitive
damages
for
a
whole
array
of--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--and,
your
honor,
to
the
extent,
if
the
court
has
concerns
about
addressing
that
--
and
again,
i
--
i'm
happy
to
go
on
as
to
why
it
would
be
artificial
to
consider
the
two
separately.
but
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that,
rather
than
effectively
amending
the
adea,
that
the
gera
amendments
in
1991
really
created
a
whole
new
statute
that
needs
to
be
considered
independent,
the
proper
remedy
would
not
be
to
dismiss
this
appeal,
but
would
be
to
vacate
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
to
permit
respondent
to
raise
a
claim
that
is
new
to
this
case
on
the
merits
here;
namely,
that
there
are
different
rules
for
appointees
than
employees.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
this
--
if
i'm
understanding
your
question,
that
if
--
if
the
--
depending
on
how
this
court
rules,
it
is
always
true
under
rule
54
that
he
could
seek
to
have
the
district
court
reconsider
his
status.
it's
also
true
that
if
he
wished
to
proceed
under
the
gera
process
for
vindicating
adea
rights,
he
has
the
option
of
seeking
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
of
his
statutory
claims
--
this
has
occurred
in
a
handful
of
district
court
opinions
--
and
then
ask
the
eeoc
if
he
can
proceed
in
the
first
instance
before
an
alj
and
to
advance
those
claims.
that
is
also
an
option.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
was
--
pronounced
a
rule
that
was
indifferent
as
between
appointees
and
employees.
the
reason
for
that
was
the
seventh
circuit
was
asked
to
announce
a
rule
that
is
indifferent
as
to
employees
and
appointees.
there
was
--
the
respondent
sought
and
obtained
a
rule
that
the
adea
does
not
displace,
period.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
there's
very
little
lower
court
authority
on
the
effect
of
gera.
i
will
say
that
what
courts
have
done
for
i
--
there
is
a
case,
for
example,
in
which
the
allegation
was
title
vii
as
amended
in
1991.
and
the
court
construed
that
naturally
to
include
the
gera
rights.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
to
reiterate
a
point
made
just
a
few
moments
ago,
i
think
that
the
proper
resolution,
if
--
gera
and
the
adea,
again,
are
really
one
remedial
regime.
and
--
and
i've
--
i've
pointed
out
1981(a)
as
an
example
of
a
--
of
a
similar
regime
where
punitive
damages
were
added
to
a
numbers
of
statutes.
and
yet
if
we
considered
any
one
of
those
statute
today,
we
would
agree
that
it
includes
punitive
damages,
even
though
it
was
added
in
a
freestanding
statute
as
part
of
the
1991
act.
but,
again,
i
would
say
as
a
procedural
matter,
should
the
court
harbor
concerns
about
this
issue
and
wish
to
permit
the
claim
that
appointees
and
employees
are
entitled
to
different
displacement
rules
and
the
counterargument
that,
no,
they're
not
because
gera
effectively
amends
and
adds
to
the
adea,
the
way
to
handle
that
procedurally
would
be
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
to
let
the
parties
argue
those
points
to
that
court.
as
it
stands,
the
seventh
circuit
was
asked
to
issue
a
broad
pronouncement
that
is
indifferent
to
whether
--
the
seventh
circuit
was
well
aware
and
states
that
mr.
levin
was
subject
to
an
interlocutory
determination
that
he
was
an
appointee.
and
the
court
went
on,
and
the
only
relevance
that
had
in
the
court's
analysis
based
on
the
way
it
was
framed
below
is
that,
well,
because
appointees
and
people
under
40
and
other
categories
appear
to
be
carved
out
--
and
we
have
answers
to
all
of
those
in
our
briefs
in
response
--
but
because
all
of
them
appear
to
be
carved
out,
the
adea
does
not
displace
ever
as
to
appointees
or
employees.
that
doesn't
contemplate
a
new
argument
that
as
an
--
as
an
appointee,
rather,
mr.
levin
has
--
is
subject
to
a
different
displacement
rule.
it
would
be
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
confront
that
in
the
first
place.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
what
the
seventh
circuit
held
is
that
the
adea
does
not
displace
section
1983
claims
for
employees
or
appointees.
it
was
a
sweeping
ruling
that
was
sought.
and
the
contention
now
is,
well,
perhaps
the
court
should
not
have
reached
such
a
sweeping
ruling.
perhaps
the
court
could
have
ruled
instead
that
as
an
appointee,
mr.
levin
is
entitled
to
a
different
rule
that
is
specific
to
appointees
because
they're
exempt
under
the
adea.
that
argument
was
never
advanced
before
the
seventh
circuit.
and
at
this
point,
again,
we
would
say
should
the
court
harbor
concerns
about
addressing
this
case,
we
would
ask
that
they
--
they
vacate
and
let
the
seventh
circuit
addressed
that
issue
in
the
first
instance.
if
permitted,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
quick
points.
justice
kagan,
in
answer
to
your
question
to
my
colleague,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases,
nor
can
i
conceive
of
one,
in
which
one
would
have
an
equal
protection
claim
but
could
not
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
adea.
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
kimel
makes
clear
that
such
a
universe
does
not
exist.
the
question
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
sotomayor
regarding
the
scope
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
below,
proof
positive
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
--
was,
in
fact,
announcing
the
sweeping
rule
that
respondent
sought
is
the
fact
that
the
court
departs
openly
from
the
--
the
law
in
other
circuits.
so
it
was
in
fact
they
were
creating,
they
were
knowingly
creating
the
split.
the
only
reference
in
the
analysis
portion
of
the
case
to
the
fact
that
there
are
exemptions
for
high-level
officials
appears
on
page
33a.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
sure.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
sure,
your
honor.
there
are
really
two
parts
to
my
answer.
the
first
is
they
--
they
didn't.
it
has
been
overstated
what
has
not
--
what
has
been
exempted.
our
position
is
that
nobody
whose
section
1983
claims
are
--
would
be
displaced
would
not,
in
exchange,
receive
the
full
rights
and
benefits
under
the
adea.
there
is
a
reference
to--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--of
course.
nobody
who
--
the
universe
of
--
of
employees,
or
workers,
to
use
the
neutral
term
here.
the
universe
of
workers
who
would
not
have
a
section
1983
claim
under
the
state's
theory,
that
every
member
of
that
universe
would
have
a
right
to
bring
a
claim
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
under
40s,
we
agree
--
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
we
agree
that
under
40
that
was
not
the
social
ill
that
congress
was
addressing
in
the
age
discrimination
act,
consistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
cline;
and,
therefore,
those
individuals
retain
their
right,
the
small
workplace,
the
under
20.
the
eeoc--
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
--yes.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
yes.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
they
would.
we
do
not
--
we
--
we
understand
the
displacement
doctrine
and
--
and
certainly,
as
applied
here,
it
would
displace
the
1983
remedies.
we
assume
that
courts
retain
their
inherent
authority
to
use
equitable
power
to
stop
the
ongoing
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
your
honor,
smith
--
as
we
understand
smith,
and
certainly
as
it's
been
read
by
rancho
palos
verdes
in
fitzgerald
even,
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
lodestar
inquiry
and
i
think
word
primary
emphasis
of
that
phrase
may
be
used
in
fitzgerald
to
describe
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
regime
as
the
first
and
most
important
inquiry.
after
that,
smith
makes
clear
that
we
are
allowed
to
consider
if
there
is
a
comprehensive
regime,
whether
there
is
contrary
evidence
in
the
face
of
the
legislative
history,
as
there
is,
for
example,
for
title
vii,
not
so
for
the
adea.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
when
congress
provided
the
expanded
right,
they
recognized
that
there
were
characteristics
particular
to
age
discrimination
that
warranted
very
low
damages
awards
and
a
procedural
predicate
that
would
emphasize
swift
and
informal
dispute
resolution.
mr.
michael
a.
scodro
thank
you.
