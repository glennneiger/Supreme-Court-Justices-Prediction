justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
you
see
the
distinction
or
--
or
you're
facing
the
distinction.
the
right
not
to
be
tried
is
one
of
qualified
immunity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
can
have
a
constitutional
violation
and
still
not
have
a
remedy,
which
is
what
this
question
involves.
so,
how
do
we
deal
with
the
concept
that
other
people
who
have
motions
to
dismiss
that
are
denied
still
undergo
trials,
still
experience
the
expense,
and
yet
we've
said
repeatedly,
an
interlocutory
appeal
is
not
warranted.
and
so,
what
makes
it
warranted
here
where
a
court
has
already
said
that
there
was
a
--
or
at
least
there's
enough
evidence
to
suggest
a
constitutional
violation
and
that
a
reasonable
officer
wouldn't
have
believed
his
or
--
a
person
would
have
believed
his
or
her
conduct
was
appropriate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i
--
the
only
issue
that's
before
us
is
whether
someone
who's
exempted
from
the
adea
still
has
a
1983
claim,
correct?
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
said.
if
you're
not
a
part
of
the
statute,
then
you
still
have
your
1983
rights?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
if
you've
satisfied
my
colleagues.
i'm
not
sure
that
you've
answered
directly.
i
think
your
adversary
is
right
that
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
no
one
is
precluded
from
a
1983
claim,
whether
they're
an
employee
or
a
non-employee.
that's
the
way
the
case
was
litigated.
that's
the
way
they
decided.
the
broad
statement,
whether
he's
an
employee
or
not
an
employee,
he
doesn't
have
a
1983
--
he
has
a
1983
action.
you've
come
in
and
you've
said
he's
not
an
employee,
so
he's
entitled
to
his
1983
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
my
colleagues
are
asking
you,
that
only
takes
care
of
half
of
this
problem,
because
the
circuit
said
even
if
he
was
an
employee
he
would
still
have
it.
and
so
you're
being
asked,
are
you
giving
up
that
part
of
the
claim,
that
he's
not
an
employee?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
what
the
authority
is
for
congress
to
extinguish
a
right
for
a
constitutional
violation?
meaning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assume
that
someone
--
it
was
the
question
that
justice
alito
asked
you
--
someone
under
of
the
age
of
40,
someone
who's
not
covered
by
any
statute,
someone
who's
part
of
an
employer
under
20.
what
would
suggest
to
you
in
this
statute
that
congress
intended
to
extinguish
those
people's
rights?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
restate
that
again
so
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
absent
the
gera--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
people
who
are
executive
officers,
etcetera,
absent
the
gera--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
they
have
retained
their
constitutional
right?
