if
we
adopt
that
formulation
and
that
solution,
is
it
as
if
we
are
granting
certiorari
before
judgment
on
an
issue
in
our
own
discretion?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
--
what's
the
mechanism
for
us
--
what's
the
rationale
that
we
can
exercise
jurisdiction
where
a
court
of
appeals
could
not?
because
we
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--authority
to
grant
certiorari
before
judgment
or
for
some
other
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
any
unfairness
to
the
parties
if
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
for
it
in
turn
to
remand
to
the
district
court
to
see
whether
or
not
the
gera
issue
has
been
properly
presented
or
waived
and
to
consider
that?
would
there
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--any
unfairness
to
the
parties
in
doing
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
argument
--
that
argument
could
be
made
in
the
district
court.
