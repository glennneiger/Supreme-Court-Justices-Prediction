justice
elena
kagan
could
i
go
back,
mr.
scodro,
to
the
--
to
the
rationale
of
--
of
the
--
that
you're
relying
on.
i
mean,
you
keep
on
saying
“
part
and
parcel
”.
but
how
is
it
part
and
parcel?
that
seems
to
ally
the
distinction
between
a
right
and
a
remedy.
there's
one
question
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
law.
justice
elena
kagan
there's
another
question
whether
a
cause
of
action
exists
to
remedy
that
violation.
why
aren't
those
two
separate
inquiries?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
i'm
asking
you
to
explain
it
to
me--
justice
elena
kagan
--because
that
footnote
is
about
a
sentence
long.
so
what's
the
theory
as
to
why
these
are
part
and
parcel
of
each
other?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
seems
a
different
argument,
not
that
the
two
really
are
intertwined
with
each
other,
but
it
--
that
it
just
might
make
sense
to
consider
the
one
at
the
outset
even
though,
in
fact,
it's
a
separate
inquiry.
justice
elena
kagan
for
some
--
please.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
mr.
levin
is
covered
not
by
the
adea,
but
by
a
separate
statute,
the
gera.
and
there's
a
separate
question
whether
the
gera
would
displace
constitutional
relief,
which
apparently
has
--
has
never
been
argued
to
anybody
in
this
case.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
there
are
some
many
similarities,
many
similarities,
between
the
adea
and
the
gera.
but
there
are
also
real
differences.
i
mean,
they're
obvious
--
they
obviously
cover
different
people;
there
are
different
procedural
prerequisites
for
the
suit;
you
get
a
different
kind
of
review,
you
only
get
administrative
review
under
the
gera.
so
it's
a
separate
inquiry
as
to
whether
this
statute
that
has
some
commonalities,
some
differences,
displaces
constitutional
claims,
and
it's
an
inquiry
that
really
has
never
been
addressed
in
this
case.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
also
agree
that
he
is
covered
by
gera?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
was
never
discussed
because
you
never
raised
it;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
theobald,
are
there
any
cases
out
there
in
the
universe
of
cases
in
which
a
person
does
not
have
an
adea
claim
or
a
gera
claim,
but
has
pressed
a
successful
constitutional
claim
based
on
age
discrimination?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
the
question
is,
what
are
the
circumstances
in
which,
given
the
very
low
standard
or
given
--
given
the
very
low
rational
basis
standard,
what
are
the
circumstances
in
which
you
would
have
a
viable
constitutional
claim
but
not
a
statutory
claim?
what
would
that
case
look
like?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
not
if
there's
no
jurisdiction,
right?
if
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
the
thing
would
be
wiped
out.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
scodro,
you
are
in
a
situation
where
the
question
is
not
whether
the
remedial
scheme
displaces
a
1983
suit
brought
for
a
violation
of
the
same
statute
that
contains
the
remedial
scheme.
instead,
you
have
to
argue
that
this
remedial
scheme
displaces
a
preexisting
statutory
or
constitutional
right.
and
when
we've
had
that
situation
in
the
past,
we've
looked
to
more
than
just
the
remedial
scheme
itself.
you
know,
smith
looks
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
refers
to
constitutional
claims.
it
looks
for
legislative
history.
it
looks
to
the
coincidence
between
the
statute
--
the
new
statutory
claim
and
the
old
constitutional
claim.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
don't
have
any
of
those
things.
all
you
have
is
a
complicated
remedial
scheme,
which
would
be
enough
to
say,
look,
you
can't
bring
1983
suits
to
vindicate
this
statute.
but
seems
as
though
it's
not
enough
under
our
case
law
to
repeal
preexisting
rights
and
remedies.
