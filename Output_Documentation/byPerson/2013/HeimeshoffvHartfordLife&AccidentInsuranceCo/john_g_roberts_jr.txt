chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
pushing
this
start
to
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
and
your
answer
to
the
problems
is:
well,
don't
worry.
if
it
ever
turns
into
something
that's
going
to
be
enforced,
we
won't
enforce
it,
or
it
won't
be
enforceable
without
a
judicial
determination
about
equitable
estoppel
and
all
these
other
things
that
are
very
difficult
to
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there's
no
--
there's
no
employer
who
is
going
to
have
a
plan
put
together
and
say,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
do
this
unless
the
statute
of
limitations
for
claims
runs
from
the
proof
of
loss.
and
if
you
tell
me
it's
got
to
run
from
the
exhaustion
of
remedies,
i'm
just
not
going
to
give
a
benefit
plan.
that's
an
implausible
scenario.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
hard
to
see
what
you
mean
by
the
exceeding
rarity.
i
suspect
there
are
more
than
nine
cases
where
people
are
looking
at
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
they're
saying,
well,
i've
got
to
sue
if
i
don't
get
this
and
when
do
i
have
to
hire
a
lawyer.
and
the
last
thing
you
want
in
this
process
is
to
get
lawyers
involved
at
the
claim
procedure.
and
they
say,
well,
there's
only
10
months
left,
i'd
better
hire
a
lawyer,
you
know,
and
instead
of
the
informal
resolution,
you've
suddenly
got
lawyers
involved.
why
isn't
that
a
legitimate
concern?
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
wait
until
the
claim
is
exhausted,
you
may
--
you
may
not
need
the
lawyer
at
all.
but
if
you
don't
know
when
that
period
is
going
to
run,
you'd
better
get
one
early
--
sooner
rather
than
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
she
was
very
prudent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
she
didn't
know
when
it
was
going
to
run,
you'd
better
get
somebody
in
there
right
away.
the
typical
lay
person
who's
got
a
claim
for
$9,000
in
disability
benefits
or
whatever,
you
know,
may
not
know.
better
get
a
lawyer
to
tell
her.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
you
keep
it
as
an
informal
resolution
--
inexpensive
resolution
process
if
you
tell
somebody
look,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
getting
a
lawyer
until
we
tell
you
whether
we're
going
to
deny
your
claims
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
my
point.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
need
to
go
to
litigation.
i
think
there
are
probably
more
than
9
people
who
had
to
hire
lawyers
before
they
even
had
a
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
it's
probably
a
claimant
that
doesn't
have
all
that
much
experience
in
the
legal
system
and
doesn't
know
how
long
does
it
take,
you
know,
to
get
a
complaint
ready
and
--
i
don't
know.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
of
a
statute
of
limitations
that
runs
before
the
claim
even
accrues
requires
people
to
worry
about
their
legal
rights
in
a
way
that
--
the
simple
rule
about
when
your
benefits
are
denied,
that's
when
the
period
starts
running.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--did
i
understand
--
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
say
we
have
not
had
a
case
where
we
have
overridden
plan
terms
in
erisa
plans?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
simply
ignore.
i
mean,
is
there
any
in
which
we
have
overridden
plan
terms?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry;
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
