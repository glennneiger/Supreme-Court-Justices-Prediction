mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
limitations
provision
in
respondent's
plan
deviates
from
bedrock
federal
limitations
principles
in
a
way
that
undermines
erisa's
two-tiered
remedial
framework.
congress
enacted
that
remedial
structure,
which
requires
mandatory
exhaustion
before
judicial
review,
against
the
established
limitations
principle
that
the
limitations
period
begins
to
run
only
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues,
in
other
words,
here,
when
exhaustion
is
complete
and
the
plan
has
rendered
its
final
decision.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
right
and
i
think
state
laws
that
require
plans
to
have
this
sort
of
provision
would
be
preempted.
they
may
fall
within
the
savings
clause,
but,
as
this
court
has
said,
even
statutes
that
are
within
the
savings
clause
are
still
subject
to
ordinary
contract
preemption
principles.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
it
may
be
valid
for
many
state
law
purposes,
but
when
a
plan
is
regulated
by
erisa,
erisa's
remedial
framework
establishes
the
limits
of
what
that
plan--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
think
there'd
be
more
--
any
more
lack
of
uniformity
than
there
is
already.
in
fact,
most
of
these
state
laws,
they
--
they
actually
require
plans
to
provide
substitute
language
that
would
be
at
least
as
favorable
to
the
insureds.
for
instance,
you
could
have
a
plan
--
a
plan
could
easily
remedy
the
problem
we
have
here
by
saying
our
limitation
period
runs
from
3
years
from
proof
of
loss
or
6
months
from
the
plan's
final
determination,
whichever
is
--
is
later.
that
would
be
an
easy
way
for
a
plan
to
both
be
uniform
and
avoid
the
problem
that
we
have
here,
which
is
undermining
erisa's
remedial
framework
by
setting
the
two--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
in
this
case
we
now
know
post
hoc
that
--
that
the
petitioner
had
about
a
year.
but
the
problem
with
this
framework
is
that
it
actually
sets
the
required
exhaustion
procedure
under
1133
and
the
required
judicial
review
under
1132
against
each
other,
because
a
claimant
who
is
going
through
exhaustion
is
not
going
to
know
while
she's
going
through
the
exhaustion
process
how
much
time
she's
going
to
have
remaining.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
first,
i
think
there
is
evidence
that
there
have
been
--
that
there
have
been
problems
created
by
this
kind
of
scheme.
there's
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
exhaustion
took
4
years.
this
is
an
iterative
process;
the
department
of
labor's
regulations,
of
course,
mean
for
mainstream
cases
to
be
resolved
in
about
a
year.
but
you
can
always
have
cases
--
you
know,
these
are
situations
in
which
you
need
medical
exams;
you
need
test
results;
you
need
written
reports.
either
side--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
have
precise
statistics,
but
the
regulations
are
designed
to
be
flexible,
precisely
because
there
will
often
be
cases
in
which
one
or
the
other
side
will
need
an
extension.
and
so
there
are
many
cases
or
at
least
there
are
some
cases
here
where
--
where
if
the
limitations
period
is
3
years,
it
takes
--
it
has
taken
over
2
1/2
years
for
exhaustion
to
occur;
so
the
--
the
plaintiff
is
left
with
about
5
months
to
sue,
and
then
there's
a
question
about
whether
that's
reasonable
or
not
which
leads
to
collateral
litigation.
there
are
some
cases
where
the
statute
of
limitations
is
only
1
or
2
years.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
the
department
of
labor
would
have
that
authority
to
do
that.
and
we
think
the
statute
is
clear
right
now
that,
you
know,
several
provisions
--
there
are
several
concepts
here
that
i
think
are
very
clear.
one
is
mandatory
exhaustion
in
the
statute.
two,
congress
enacted
the
statute
against
the
traditional
limitations
rule,
which
means
that
the
statute
runs
from
the
date
of
accrual,
and
deviating
from
that
would
undermine
the
structure
by
causing
the
limitations
provision
to
work
in
a
way
that
limitations
provisions
never
do.
limitations
provisions
are
designed
to
create
certainty
for
both
parties,
so
that
you
know
when
you
have
to
bring
suit.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
we
do
think
it
would
have
that
authority
and
it
has
that
authority
because
it
has
the
authority
to
regulate
the
claims
process
and
the
procedures--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
we--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
we
do
think
the
agency
would
have
the
authority
here,
because
we
think
that
the
statute
of
limitations
--
when
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
from
is
intertwined
with
the
effectiveness
about
--
of
the
claims
procedure.
so,
because
we
think
that
the
--
that
having
the
limitations
provision
run
from
before
exhaustion
even
starts
undermines
the
efficacy
of
the
claims
procedure,
the
department
of
labor
would
have
the
authority
to
protect
the
efficacy
of
the
claims
procedure--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
can't
tell
you
right
now.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
aren't
any
such
provisions.
but
we
do
think
the
department
would
have
the
authority
here.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
the
department's
focus
--
in
2000,
the
last
time
it
regulated,
it
chose
to
focus
on
matters
that
were
directly
involved
in
the
claims
process
itself.
it
hasn't
regulated
since
then,
but
its
position
is
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
plans
to
deviate
from
bedrock
limitations
principles
like
this
and
undermine
the
remedial
scheme.
so
its
position
is
reflected
in
our
brief
and
we
think
it
could
regulate.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
might
have
the
authority
to
do
that
so
long
as
the
statute
were
framed
in
a
way
that
didn't
undermine
the
--
the
remedial
framework
here,
yes.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that
would
be
kind
of
a
bizarre
scheme
that
would
turn
the
exhaustion
process
and
the
point
of
exhaustion
on
its
head,
and
that
essentially
would
require
a
rush
to
court
by
claimants
who
don't
know
yet
whether
the
exhaustion
process
will
be
resolved
in
their
favor.
and
the
point
of
exhaustion
is
--
is
to
avoid
unnecessary
suits
like
that.
so
i
--
i
think
it
has
that
problem.
it
also
is
not
clear
that
every
claimant
is
going
to
know
to
--
to
file
a
protective
suit.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i'm
sorry.
if
you
were
to
rule
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it
is
a
judge
--
it
is
a
judge-made
doctrine,
but
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
in
this
case
exhaustion
is
--
is
established
by
statute,
it's
required
by
statute
and
by
the
regulations.
and
so,
you
know,
i
think
--
i
think
in
this
case
the
problem
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
running
well
before
the
exhaustion
process
is
complete,
and
therefore,
damages
the
efficacy
of
that
process.
