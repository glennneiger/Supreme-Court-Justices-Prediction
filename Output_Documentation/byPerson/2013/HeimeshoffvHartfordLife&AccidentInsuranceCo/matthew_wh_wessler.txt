mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
accrual
provision
in
an
erisa
plan
that
starts
the
clock
running
on
a
federal
denial
of
benefits
claim
near
the
beginning
of
erisa's
mandatory
internal
claims
process
before
the
federal
claim
ever
exists
or
could
be
filed
in
court.
this
provision
directly
conflicts
with
erisa's
two-tiered
remedial
structure,
which
is
designed
to
maximize
the
number
of
claims
that
are
resolved
internally
without
lawyers
in
courts.
the
respondent's
provision
undermines
this
goal
by
making
it
impossible
for
anyone
to
know
in
advance
how
much
time
will
be
left
on
the
limitations
clock
after
the
internal
process
is
complete.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
there
was
approximately
one
year,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
well,
i
don't
think
we
would
be
out
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
the
provision
in
this
case
was
a
three
year
from
final
denial.
going
forward,
if,
in
fact,
erisa
plans
had
a
one-year
clock
running
from
final
denial,
everyone
would
know
that
they
would
need
to
file
their
claim
within
one
year
from
time
of
final
denial.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
if,
in
fact,
the
provision
in
this
plan--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--said
one
year
from
final
denial,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
well,
i
think
this
gets
us,
your
honor,
to
one
of
the
core
problems
with
this
provision,
which
is
that
it's
confusing.
it
is
unclear.
one
of
the
key
questions
with
these
provisions,
when
they're
coupled
with
the
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement,
that
is
--
that
is
actually
quite
uncertain
when
proof
of
loss
is
due.
and
so
below,
one
--
one
of
the
key
questions
which
actually
still
remains
unresolved
is
when
the
clock
actually
started
ticking.
but
i
think
there's
a
--
there's
a
more
fundamental
problem.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that's
true;
however,
the
problem
with
these
proof
of
loss
dates
coupled
with
this
mandatory
exhaustion
requirement
is
that
it
is
unclear
from
the
outset
when
--
when
the
clock
--
how
much
time
after
final
denial
would
be
left
when
you're
in
the
middle
of
the
process.
and
on
this
question
of
proof
of
loss--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--well,
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
right,
although
i
--
there's
actually
quite
a
bit
of
disagreement
among
the
lower
courts
about
how
you
measure
proof
of
loss,
when
that
date
actually
triggers
the
limitations
clock.
so,
for
instance,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
court
has
held
the
proof
of
loss
starts
the
clock
ticking
the
first
time
proof
of
loss
is
due
under
the
plan,
which
is
the
first
set
of
documents
that
a
claimant
actually
provides
to
her
plan
supporting
her
claim
for
disability.
the
plan,
however,
through
this
internal
process,
can
come
back
and
ask
for
more
documents,
more
evidence
supporting
the
disability.
and
if
the
claimant
then
provides
those
additional
documents,
that
could
conceivably
reset
the
limitations
clock
under
this
proof
of
loss
requirement.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
well,
in
fact--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--well,
in
fact,
you
don't
have
necessarily
three
years
from
when
proof
of
loss
starts
because
courts,
as
respondents
themselves
acknowledge,
are
necessarily
going
to
have
to
evaluate
these
--
these
provisions
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
so
it's--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--well,
except,
your
honor,
that
in
erisa,
one
of
the
core
goals
of
this
statute
is
to
provide
predictability,
certainty
and
efficiency
in
the
administration
of
benefits.
and
so
to
have
courts
being
placed
in
the
center
of
what
should
be
a
straightforward
and
streamlined
process
undermines
the
way
congress
intended
this
benefits
administration
process
to
proceed.
and
if
you
--
if
you
place
courts
exactly
in
the
middle
of
this
where
they're
going
to
necessarily
be
policing
the
enforceability
of
a
--
of
a
limitations
provision
before
they
ever
get
to
the
question
of
were
the
benefits
properly
denied,
you're
undermining
the
nature
of
what
this
private
process
is
supposed
to
be.
it
was
supposed
to
be
intended
to
allow
the
parties
to
privately
resolve
their
benefit
claims
without--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
expect
that
the
--
that
--
that
for
these
denial
of
benefit
claims,
we
would
look
to
state
law
to
determine
the
length
of
the
period.
but
when
that
period
starts
running
--
and
that's
--
that's
what's
at
stake
here,
is
when
the
limitations
clock
starts
running
--
was
not
a
question
that
we
would
look
to
state
law
for;
rather,
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
when
does
the
claim
actually
become
ripe?
when
can
you
file
it
in
court?
and
--
and
what
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
limitations
provision
that
includes
an
accrual
date
that
starts
the
clock
running,
not
just
before
when
you
can
file
it
in
court,
but
before
there's
ever
even
been
an
injury.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
--
i
would
think
it
would,
because
it
--
because
it
would
conflict
with
erisa's
remedial
structure.
i
would
stress
here
that
in
this
case,
we
know
that
these
state
laws
don't
apply
to
respondent's
provision.
they
themselves
have
made
that
clear
in
their
opposition
brief.
most
state
laws,
however,
actually
include
language
to
the
effect
of
that
insurers
can
use
these
kinds
of
proof
of
loss
languages
or
something
similar
so
far
as
it's
not
any
less
favorable.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
yes.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
it
might
as
a
first
step,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
would
be
impliedly
conflicted
because
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
structure
of
erisa.
and
the
key
point
about
these
state
law
provisions,
which
i
think
is
where
this
provision
comes
from
in
respondent's
plan,
is
that
these
state
law
insurance
regimes
do
not
require
mandatory
exhaustion
of
any
internal
claims
process.
your
clock
starts
running
at
proof
of
loss
and
so
long
as
you
wait
a
60-day
waiting
period,
you
can
then
file
your
claim
in
court
regardless
of
whether
the
insurer
has
actually
acted
on
your
claim.
that
is
not
true
here.
claimants
do
not
have
the
ability
to
file
their
claims
in
court
until
they
have
exhausted
this
mandatory
process.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
well,
i
think
we
have
seen
courts
struggling
with
a
host
of
questions
about
how
to
resolve
the
enforceability
of
these
provisions.
as
just
an
example,
we
know
that
courts
are
having
now
to
be
in
the
business
of
asking
whether
the
parties'
conduct
during
this
internal
process
has
caused
some
waiver
or
estoppel
of
the
limitations
provision.
that
kind
of
inquiry,
an
estoppel
kind
of
inquiry,
is
a
fact-based
inquiry
about
whether
the
plan's
conduct
in
the
internal
process
was
unduly
reasonable--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
core
problem
here
isn't
so
much
one
of
unfairness
as
it
is
certainty
and
predictability
of
what
employees'
and
plans'
rights
are
under
an
erisa
plan.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
to
be
clear,
there
is
nothing
about
respondent's
provision
that
advances
any
of
those
goals
any
more
than
running
a
limitations
clock
one
year
from
final
denial.
as
this
court
has
said,
the
internal
claims
process
itself
provides
notice
to
all
the
parties
about
the
possibility
for
claims
and,
critically,
preserves
all
of
the
evidence
that--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--i
think
that
is
a
very
open
question.
i
do
not
know
the
answer.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
think
it
would,
but
i
also
think--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--correct.
it
would
create
a
vehicle
for
protecting
the
claimant's
rights
and
providing
certainty--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--absolutely,
your
honor.
but
that
gets
lawyers
and
courts
involved
in
a
process
that
should
be
private.
erisa's
internal
benefits
process,
it
processes
millions
of
claims
a
year.
if
we
have
lawyers
turning
what
should
be
a
non-adversarial,
private
process
into
one
that
is
adversarial
and
that
allows
for
the
possibility
of
filing
protective
actions
in
which
we
ask
the
federal
court
to
stay
a
potential
federal
claim
that
may
never
exist
while
we
are
in
this
indeterminant,
flexible
process,
the
courts
would
be
brought
directly
into
a
process
that
should
be
private.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
can't
speculate
on
what
the
government
would
do.
i
don't
actually
know
if
they
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i'm
sure
you
are.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
am
not.
their
regulations,
what
they
have
now
addresses
the
internal
claims
process.
it
doesn't
address
the
rights
that
exist
when
you
get
to
federal
court.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
would
think
that
that's
right.
i
mean,
i
think
--
i
think
a
rule
of
accrual
that
the
limitations
clock
starts
running
at
final
denial
is
exactly
the
kind
of
uniform
and
clean
rule
that
everyone
can
rely
on
ex
ante,
from
the
outset,
across
the
board
in
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
we
have
not
found
any
cases
in
which
a
claimant
has
actually
lost
the
right
to
file
a
suit.
the
problem
isn't
so
much
in
that
possibility.
the
problem
is
in
what
we
do
see,
which
is
where
there
are
three
or
four
or
two
or
five
months
left
after
final
denial
on
the
clock,
and
courts
are
now
in
the
business
of
having
to
evaluate,
does
that
give
enough
time
to
the
claimant
to
do
all
the
things
that
she
needs
to
do
to
file
her
claim?
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
think
in
fact
it's
just
the
opposite.
running
the
clock
during
the
internal
process
ex
ante,
no
one
knows
where
they
will
be
at
the
end.
this
process
is
indeterminate.
we
want
the
parties
to
take
all
the
time
they
need
to
work
it
out.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
with
respect,
your
honor,
it's
not
the
court
that
is
engaging
in
the
adversarial
process.
it's
the
private
internal
claims
process
that
is
supposed
to
be
non-adversarial
that
has
now
become
adversarial
because
there
is
now
a
lawyer
involved
who
has
advised
her
client
that
she
must
file
a
protective
action
to
avoid
the
possibility
that
she
will
lose
her
claim.
we
don't--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--that's
right,
but
we
think
that
this
provision
would
incentivize
more
lawyers
getting
involved,
because
if
you
are
uncertain
about
how
much
time
you'll
have
you
will
be
in
a
position
where
you
want
advice.
this
provision
breeds
confusion,
and
when
we
are
confused
we
look
for
help,
and
the
help
that
is
going
to
come
into
this
process
are
lawyers
who
are
going
to
take
the
kinds
of
strategic
action
that
justice
breyer
suggested
and
involve
the
courts
in
what
should
be
a
private
process.
that
in
and
of
itself
drastically
undermines
the
point
of
this
internal
benefit
administration
and
just
amplifies
and
magnifies
the
litigation
costs
associated
with
it.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
thank
you.
just
a
few
--
a
few
brief
points.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
thank
you.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
in
unum
v.
ward
refused
to
enforce
a
plan
term
that
would
have
overridden
a
state
law
notice
prejudice
rule.
but
i
think
the
bigger
point
here
is
that
provisions--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--unum
v.
ward,
your
honor.
the
bigger
point
here
is
that
provisions
that
tamper
with
the
enforcement
scheme,
as
this
provision
does,
are
inconsistent
with
erisa's
remedial
structure.
by
respondent's
own
argument
this
is
not
an
enforce
the
contract
provision.
this
is
a
sometimes
enforcing
the
contract
provision,
that
is
itself
automatically
subject
to
a
reasonableness
override,
in
which
courts
can
and
are
expected
to
actually
decline
to
enforce
the
plain
language
of
the
provision
in
cases
in
which
it
finds
under
a
host
of
fact-specific
questions,
the
provision
is
either
unreasonable
or
the
plan
is
he
is
estopped
from
enforcing
it
or
has
waived
it.
and
that,
we
submit,
your
honor,
is
the
key
defect
with
this
provision,
because
it
puts
courts
right
in
the
center
of
policing
what
should
be
a
private
process.
if
plans
are
--
if
courts
are
able
to
look
back
and
determine
whether
a
plan's
conduct
in
the
internal
process
was
--
was
unreasonable,
was
dilatory,
was
unreasonably
delayed,
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
private
benefit
resolution
process,
which
this
court
has
said,
as
have
all
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
looked
at
it,
is
designed
to
be
non-adversarial,
flexible,
and
private,
turns
into
something
that
looks
like
none
of
those
things.
it
turns
into
a
process
in
which
lawyers
get
involved
early,
in
which
courts
get
involved
early,
and
in
which
these
plan
terms
are
subject
to
revision
or
over
--
overrides
in
a
host
of
cases
and
in
which
both
plans
and
claimants
have
no
idea
ex
ante
whether
or
when
this
provision
will
be
enforced.
a
rule
running
from
final
denial,
which
i
should
say
is
the
consistent
rule
across
the
board
in
every
federal
statutory
regime,
stated
--
going
back
from
--
to
the
beginning
of
the
law
that
we
have
been
able
to
find,
runs
the
limitations
clock
from
when
you
can
file
the
claim
in
court.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
--
i
think
not.
i
think
plans
have
absolute
authority
to
--
to
themselves
specify
the
length
of
the
period.
we
see
this--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--i
think
that
--
i
think
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
i
don't
think
that's
actually
correct.
most
plans
that
run
the
length
only
do
about
a
one
year
from
--
from
final
denial.
as
respondents
themselves
have
--
have
explained,
and
we
agree,
courts
across
the
board
find
one
year
in
almost
every
context
to
be
reasonable.
and
so
it
would
automatically
be
enforced.
but
the
difference
also
is
in
the
type
of
reasonableness
inquiry
that
a
court
would
have
to
apply
in
--
in
the
case
that
you're
suggesting,
which
is
not
a
fact-specific
inquiry
based
on
how
long
the
parties
took
to
pursue
this
internal
process.
it's
simply
an
objective
question.
is
the
amount
of
time
on
the
limitations
clock
enough
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
file
her
claim
in
court?
and
one
month
--
excuse
me.
one
year
from
final
denial
would
absolutely
be
enough
time,
would
provide
all
parties
under
erisa
with
the
certainty
that
they
have
to
--
to
file
their
claim.
thank
you,
your
honor.
