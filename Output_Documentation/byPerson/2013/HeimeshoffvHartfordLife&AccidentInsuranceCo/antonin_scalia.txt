justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
i
guess
there
are
answers
to
these
--
to
these
legal
questions,
whether
it's
the
first
filing
or
if
supplemental
documents
are
required,
it's
the
second
filing.
there's
an
answer,
you
know?
some
court
will
provide
the
answer.
the
mere
fact
that
--
that
provisions
in
a
contract
are
subject
to
various
interpretations
doesn't
make
the
provision
invalid.
it
means
something.
we
just
don't
know
right
now
what
it
means
until
--
until
a
court
provides
the
answer.
but
wow,
that's
not
different
from
any
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
hasn't
undermined
the
framework.
i
mean,
petitioner
had
a
year.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
if
--
a
finding
that
a
particular
case
is
--
is
not
filed
too
late
when
indeed
there
was
--
there
was
no
time
to
do
it.
but
here
they
--
they
had
a
year.
why
--
why
does
that
undermine
the
framework?
if
and
when
they
don't
have
enough
time,
the
court
can
say
the
--
this
suit
is
not
precluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
--
that's
the
internal
claims.
do
you
know
any
other
instance
in
which
--
when
a
suit
can
be
brought
in
--
in
federal
court
will
be
determined
by
an
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
agency
saying
you've
got
to
sue
within
1
year;
you've
got
to
sue
within
6
years.
offhand,
i
can't
think
of
any,
and
--
and
i
think
it
goes
well
beyond
what
--
what
the
executive
is
authorized
to
prescribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
any
other
instances
where
--
where
a
federal
agency
has,
in
effect,
prescribed
the
running
of
the
statute
for
the
courts?
maybe
there
are
some,
but
i
don't
know
of
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
to
provide
benefits
at
all,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
they
do,
they
do
it
on
their
own
terms.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
equitable
tolling
apply
if
you
don't
have
enough
time
to
prepare
the
court
suit?
you
have
just
a
month,
let's
say,
and
it's
not
your
fault
because
you
pursued
the
administrative
proceedings
vigorously
and
promptly.
why
wouldn't
it
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
these
seven
people,
nine
people
--
how
many
were
there?
over
40
years,
they
probably
had
a
way
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
position
on
whether
the
executive
can
prescribe
when
--
when
suit
must
be
brought?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
going
to
do
this
for
a
lobby
of
nine
people,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
this
contract
required
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
before
you
can
sue.
isn't
that
in
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
a
judge-created
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
create
it
in
other
instances
where
--
where
there
are
agency,
you
know,
requirements
to
go
through
the
agency,
and
we
--
we
make
it
up.
but
here
it's
--
it's
in
the
contract,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
are
not
as
entitled
to
fiddle
with
it
as
much
as
we
are
when
it
is
our
creation,
i
suppose.
