justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
the
court
below
said
that
that
was
irrelevant
to
the
resolution
of
this
case,
that
even
if
they
accepted
your
date
for
when
the
proof
of
loss
started,
that
you
would
still
lose.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
little
confused
because
it
would
be
the
same
no
matter
what
rule
we
instituted.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning,
you
would
never
know
when
the
administrative
--
you
really
never
know
when
the
administration
process
is
final,
just
like
you're
arguing
you
don't
know
when
the
proof
of
loss
date
is
final.
but
at
least
the
advantage
of
proof
of
loss,
you
know
you
got
three
years
from
at
least
the
beginning
of
the
process.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
can
only
help
you.
it
gives
you
more
time,
but
it
doesn't
take
time
away
from
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
say
you
have
three
years,
no
matter
what.
from
the
first
date,
you
have
three
years.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
need
more
time,
you
have
a
potential
out.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
if
we
rule
in
your
favor
--
i'm
sorry,
against
you
--
and
just
say
the
plans
can
do
this,
do
you
see
any
reason
why
the
government
couldn't
pass
a
regulation
saying
you've
got
to
give
people
at
least
a
year
from
the
end
of
the
administrative
process
to
file?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
going
to
ask
them
that
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
are
you
aware
of
anything
that
would
stop
them
from
doing
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
however,
they
would
be
estopped
from
passing
a
regulation
requiring
something
different
than
what
we
say,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
could
be
more
troubled
by
this
case
if
the
proof
of
loss
provision
required
a
suit
to
be
brought
in
a
year,
because
as
i'm
adding
up
the
timeframe,
it's
about
15
months
if
no
exceptions
remain
for
the
administrative
process.
could
you
answer
my
question
on
whether
you
see
any
impediment
if
we
rule
against
you
in
this
case,
to
the
department
saying
something
like,
you've
got
to
give
at
least
a
year,
from
the
finality
of
the
administrative
process?
could
you
pass
such
a
regulation
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
would
your
argument
be
if
--
if
this
--
if
erisa
said
there
is
a
minimum
3-year
statute
of
limitations?
would
your
argument
be
identical
today
or
would
that
be
a
clearer
demonstration
that
congress
intended
that
the
background
principle
that
that
starts
from,
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
process,
be
incorporated?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
do
you
require
an
explicit
agreement
that
the
start
is
going
to
be
different
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
you
can
shorten
or
lengthen
a
limitations
period,
but
this
is
not
about
shortening
or
lengthening
a
limitations
period.
this
is
about
changing
a
start
time
for
the
limitations
period.
do
you
require
something
explicit
--
an
explicit
statement
as
to
that
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
think
congress
would
only
legislate
in
that
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
think
congress
would
only
legislate
that
way.
do
you
have
any
examples
of
that,
of
congress
saying
the
limitations
period
starts
at
the
end
of
the
administrative
process
and
is
for
3
years
or
1
year?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
much
better.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
case
is
that?
