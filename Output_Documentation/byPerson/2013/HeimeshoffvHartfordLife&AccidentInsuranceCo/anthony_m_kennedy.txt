is
there
any
evidence
in
other
circuits
that
have
this
same
rule
that
--
that
the
approach
the
respondents
advocate
has
caused
difficulties
and
disruption
and
unfairness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
this
case,
as
justice
ginsburg
indicated
at
the
outset,
there
was
a
period
of
i
think
just
over
a
year,
in
which
it
was
very
clear
that
the
administrative
process
had
ended
and
nothing
happened.
i
don't
see
the
unfairness
in
the
application
of
the
rule
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
there
is
also
certainty
and
fairness
in
processing
the
claim,
and
when
evidence
is
lost,
especially
in
cases
where
employees
who
were
key
witnesses
have
likely
departed,
that's
another
very
important
consideration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
general
statutes,
so
they
would
be
preempted
just
in
this
class
of
claims.
so
lawyers
would
have
to
know
that
this
statute
is
still
valid
for
many
purposes
but
not
for
erisa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
have
--
you
have
lack
of
uniformity
within
the
state
on
when
these
claims
must
be
brought
under
an
insurance
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
fair
to
say,
in
other
words,
that
it's
typical
in
the
insurance
industry
that
statute
of
limitations
run
from
proof
of
loss?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
occurrence?
