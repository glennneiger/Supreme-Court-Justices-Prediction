ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
subject
to
state
insurance
law,
erisa
gives
employers
broad
leeway
to
choose
the
terms
on
which
they
agree
to
provide
benefits,
and
the
suits
for
benefits
due
under
an
erisa
plan
can
seek
only
to
enforce
those
agreed-upon
terms.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
exactly.
but
one
of
congress's
purposes--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
that
was
one
of
congress's
overarching
purposes
in
enacting
the
statute.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
well,
i
think
when
those
situations
arise
--
and
to
be
clear,
we
have
40,
almost
40
years
of
experience
under
erisa
of
these
provisions
coexisting
with
the
erisa
remedial
framework.
and
in
that
time
period,
to
come
up
with,
i
recall,
was
it
five
or
nine
cases--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--of
course.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
in
the
highly
unusual
circumstances
where
those
situations
arise,
and
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
they
are
anything
but
highly
unusual,
we
think
courts
are
well
equipped
to
apply
the
same
equitable
doctrines
that
courts
have
always
applied
to
statutes
of
limitations
when
situations
like
that
arise.
i
think
my
friend
referred
to--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--in
the
lamantia
case
cited
in
the
reply
brief,
the
doctrine
that
was
applied
was
equitable
estoppel,
because
in
the
facts
of
that
case
you
couldn't
get
to
a
four-year
point
without
a
final
decision
without
something
having
gone
wrong.
and
in
that
case
there
was--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--there
are
many.
i
want
to
be
clear.
estoppel
applies
where
the
facts
support
it,
as
do
equitable
tolling,
as
do
the
several
provisions
in
the
department
of
labor
regulations
that
already
account
precisely
for
the
interaction
between
the
internal
review
process
and--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--i
think
it
very
well
might,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
that
is
not
a
perfectly
adequate
solution.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--our
position
is
that
this
limitation
provision,
like
any
limitation
provision,
whether
contractual
or
statutory,
is
subject
to
equitable
doctrines
that
might
apply
on
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
these
are
not
novel
doctrines
that
courts
are
unaccustomed
to
applying
and
we
don't
think
that
they
are
particularly
difficult.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
strike
the
--
strike
the
state
statute?
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
mean,
i
--
going
back
to
the
preemption
analysis
that
justice
alito
referred
to,
i
think
that
provision
would
clearly
fall
within
the
savings
clause,
and
the
thrust
of
this
court's
erisa
implied
conflict
preemption
cases
has
been
to
ask
only
whether
the
state
law
purports
to
supplement
or
displace
the
exclusive
remedial
scheme
under
erisa.
and
i
don't
think
that
provision
would.
now,
maybe
there
would
be
a
new
analysis
we
would
have
to
ask,
which
is,
does
this
provision
provide
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
full
and
fair
review,
and
does
it
practically
deprive
claimants
of
the
opportunity
to
obtain
judicial
review
at
the
end
of
that
period.
and
maybe
we
would
have--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--i
think
--
i
think
we
would
apply
that
same
analysis
of
asking,
has
there
been
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
full
and
fair
review,
and
has
the
claimant
been
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
seek
judicial
review?
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
yes.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case,
because
i
do
think
we
--
i
think
our
--
our
experience
with
erisa
provisions
generally
does
suggest
that
exhaustion
can
take,
you
know,
usually
about
a
year,
maybe
a
little
over
a
year.
and
so
that
would
be
a
harder
case.
it's
not
what
the
laws
of
the
vast
majority
of
states
do
require,
though,
and
it's
not
the
provision
that's
in
this
policy.
and
i
think
just
as
there
can
be
line-drawing
in
that
direction,
there
could
be
line-drawing
questions
asked
of
my
friend,
what
is--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--well,
i
don't
want
to
--
if
i
--
if
i
--
if
i
suggested
that
i
wanted
to
completely
concede
that,
i
misspoke
because
i
think
it's
a
hard
question.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is.
but
i
think--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--okay.
well,
i
think
that's
--
i
mean,
going
back
to
the
riddlesbarger
decision
and
wolfe,
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
common
law
principle
that
contracting
parties
may
agree
to
a
limitations
provision,
it
must
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
framework,
and
it
must
provide
a
period
of
time
for
suit
that's
not
unreasonably
short.
and
i
think
the
court
could
apply--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--justice
breyer,
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
what
would
be
the
best
idea
or
the
best,
most
simple
model
if
we
were
writing
on
a
blank
slate.
the
question
is,
is
this
term
in
an
erisa
plan,
in
a
suit
from
which
the
petitioner's
rights
flow
from
that
plan
and
her
cause
of
action
seeks
to
enforce
the
terms
of
that
plan
--
may
that
provision
be
excised
from
every
plan
in
which
it
appears
in
all
cases
on
a
categorical
basis,
because
we
can
imagine
the
possibility
of
five
or
nine
cases
in
which
its
operation
had
to
be
addressed
through
the
application
of
traditional
equitable
doctrines.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
do
think
that
the
current
wording
of
the
provision
has
a
lot
to
recommend
it,
and
that's
why
you
see
it
used
as
the
typical
model
in
insurance.
and
here
are
a
couple
of
the
things.
one
is
that--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--being
proof
of
loss.
and
that
is--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--that
is
because,
from
the
moment
the
claim
is
filed,
we
know
at
the
outset
that
the
books
can
be
closed
on
the
claim
for
reserving
purposes
three
years
from
the
proof
of
loss
date;
whereas
under
a
limitation
period
that
does
not
commence
until
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
process,
we
won't
know
from
the
outset
when
the
limitation
period
will
run
or
not.
and
so
this
provision
provides
some
certainty
that
the
other
type
of
provision
doesn't.
i'm
not
saying.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
justice
ginsburg,
that's
actually
not
correct,
and
we've
provided
some
examples
at
pages
20
to
21
of
the
red
brief
that
show
how
these
provisions
do
commonly
work
in
the
traditional
insurance
context.
and
what
you
commonly
see
is
a
limitation
period,
often
about
12
months,
that
will
run
from
the
time
of
the
insured
loss,
let's
say
the
time
of
the
fire
in
a
fire
insurance
policy.
what
subsequently
must
happen
within
that
12
months
is
that
the
claimant
must
present
proof
of
loss
within
the
12
months
as
the
clock
is
ticking.
sometimes
they
must
await
the
insurer's
decision.
sometimes
they
simply
have
a
waiting
period.
and
then
they
have
to
file
suit.
and
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
scheme
that
this
court
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
wolfe
case.
and
what
that
model
is
about
is
--
i
mean,
i
think
we're
all
very
familiar
with
the
kind
of
federal
administrative
scheme
where
there
are
several
steps
of
administrative
review,
followed
by
a
judicial
review
step,
where
congress
writes
a
limitation
period
that's
essentially
a
grant
of
time
in
which
a
claimant
can
proceed
from
one
step
to
the
next.
but
that's
not
the
only
model,
and
it's
not
the
model
that
characterizes
the
insurance
practice.
with
that
model
--
the
way
that
often
works
is
there
is
a
deadline
out
there
in
the
future,
and
by
that
deadline
a
claimant
must
complete
the
pre-litigation
steps
necessary
and
file
their
claim.
that's
the
type
of
model
that
this
court
also
considered
in
enforcing
the
mcmahon
case.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
says
one
model
versus
the
other
is
the
only
way
a
limitation
period
can
ever
be
written.
and
in
erisa,
congress
did
not
step
in
to
decide
what
it
thought
the
limitation
period
ought
to
be
or
how
it
thought
it
ought
to
work.
it
instead
said,
number
one,
we
want
to
defer
to
state
insurance
regulators;
even
though
these
provisions
had
long
been
on
the
books
already,
we
want
to
defer
to
state
insurance
regulators
to
govern
the
content
of
insured
plans.
and
number
two,
we
want
to
defer
to
employers'
decisions
about
the
terms
on
which
they
want
to
enter
into
the
voluntary
undertaking
of
providing
benefits.
and
it
is
a
voluntary
undertaking
and
congress,
speaking
about
concerns
about
uncertainty
and
so
on,
the
primary
uncertainty
that
congress
was
worried
about
and
that
would
be
visited
on
employers
and
insurers
if
this
court
were
to
--
were
to
rule
for
ms.
heimeshoff,
would
be
that
we
don't
want
to
be
in
a
legal
regime
where
every
term
in
an
erisa
plan
is
potentially
unenforceable
because
someone
can
imagine
a
handful
of
five
or
nine
cases
in
which
it's
unfair.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
i
think
that
it's
a
broader
point,
however,
in
terms
of
the
uncertainty
that
this
would
raise.
to
--
to
say
that
this
provision
should
be
excised
from
erisa
plans
in
all
plans
where
it
appears,
for
all
cases,
because
of
speculation
about
what
might
happen
in
some
cases
but
does
not
usually
happen,
to
say
that
that
can
be
a
basis
absent
any
other
anchor
in
the
statute
for
judicially
rewriting
or
ignoring
plan
terms,
would
be
a
tectonic
shift
in
the
law
of
erisa
in
terms
of
congress's
goal
of
making
sure
that
plans
would
be
enforced
as
written,
particularly
in
a
cause
of
action
under
section
(a)(1)(b),
which
is
a
suit
not
to
defeat
the
plan
terms,
but
to
enforce
the
plan
terms.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
under
the
--
under
the
principle
this
court
recognized
in
riddlesbarger
and
wolfe,
parties
to
a
contract
may
agree
to
a
limitation
period
that
differs
from
one
in
the
governing
scheme.
so,
for
example--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--an
explicit
agreement--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--your
honor,
if
i
am
understanding
the
question
correctly,
i
think
if
you
--
if
you
begin
from
the
premise,
as
i
think
all
parties
do,
that
--
that
contracting
parties
may
agree
to
the
length
of
the
limitation
period--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--a
limitation
period
--
a
length
of
a
limitation
period
can't
be
defined
or
expressed
without
reference
to
some
starting
point.
it's
not
the
norm
to
say,
oh,
we're
going
to
have
a
3-year
period.
you
would
say
it's
3
years
from
some
date.
it's
3
years
from
proof
of
loss
or
3
years
from
notice
or
3
years
from
discovery,
or
3
years
from
my
decision--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
well,
typically,
congress
writes
limitations
periods
that
run
from
the
time
the
“
cause
of
action
”,
quote-unquote,
accrues,
which
is
why
this
court--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--usually
has
to
decide
when
the
cause
of
action
accrued.
but
that's
not
always
the
case.
so
in
the
dodd
case,
for
instance,
the
limitation
period
in
the
federal
habeas
statute
is
not
drawn
to
anything
having
to
do
with
accrual,
but
to
a
--
a
menu
of
a
series
of
particular
events.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
under
this
provision
where
the
parties,
rather
than
defining
the
limitation
period
by
reference
to
the
accrual
of
a
cause
of
action,
they
have
defined
it
by
reference
to
a
particular
point
in
time,
which
is
a
model
that
is
common
in
--
in
the
insurance
practice
and
has
been
widely
used
in
erisa
plans
since
erisa's
enactment.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
here's
how
the
department
of
labor
has
threaded
that
needle,
and
that
is
in
the
provisions
of
the
regulations
that
say
things
like,
if
an
erisa
plan
provides
for
additional
voluntary
appeals
beyond
the
minimum
that's
necessary,
then
the
plan
must
agree
to
--
not
to
assert
any
defense
based
on
the
statute
of
limitations
or
timeliness.
and
so
i
think
that
sort
of
approach
is
probably
something
that
they
could
do.
i
mean,
i
think
that
probably
avoids
the
question
that
your
honor
was
asking
earlier.
i
think,
you
know,
as
far
as
the
dol's
regulatory
authority
more
generally,
i
think
there
is
also
the
looming
question
about
whether
the
department
has
statutory
authority
to
adopt
a
regulation
that
would
have
the
effect
of
preempting
state
law.
but
leaving
those
authority
questions
aside,
i
think
the
only
other
question
is
whether
the
department
could
compile
a
factual
record
that
would
provide
a
non-arbitrary
basis
for
taking
this
action.
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
they
could,
but
it's
certainly
within
their
right
to
initiate
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
to
try
to
do
that.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
there
whether
the
inclusion
of
a
particular
statute
of
limitations
was
meant
to
limit
contracting
parties'
ability
to
agree
to
a
different
one.
and
i
think
if
you
had
a
situation
where,
you
know,
let's
say
the
court
in
this
case
upholds
the
plan's
provision
and
then
congress
amends
the
statute
to
say,
you
know,
we
really
think
this
doesn't
make
sense
and
we
want
to
have
a
different
rule,
i
think
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
that
that
statute
was
intended
to
foreclose,
as
congress
may
do,
the
right
of
--
of
parties
to
contract
around
that
rule.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
i
wouldn't
expect
so.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
well,
the
3
years
from
proof
of
loss
is
the
standard
provision.
so
that
is
typical.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
yes.
in
--
in
certain
types
of
insurance
contracts,
yes.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
i
have
--
i
--
we
have
looked
far
and
wide
for
empirical
information
about
this
and
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
refer
your
honor
to
page
29
of
the
amicus
brief
for
the
american
council
of
life
insurers,
which
does
collect
a
little
bit
of
empirical
information
about
the
exceeding
rarity
with
which
this
issue
ever
arises
in
erisa
cases
and
the
typical
length
of
time
that's
required
to
exhaust.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
well,
of
course
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
did
have
counsel
from
relatively
early
on
in
the
process.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
so
i'm
not
sure
that
--
pardon?
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
and,
your
honor,
that
easy,
inexpensive
process
is
how
it
works
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
i
think
something
like
80
percent
of
disability
claims
are
granted
through
the
internal
review
process
without
there
ever
being
any
need
to
go
to
litigation.
and
i
think
the
reason--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--oh,
i
think
that's
right.
i
mean,
this
is
not
--
i
think
our
best
sense
is
that
there's
something
around
the
order
of
about
a
quarter
to
a
third
of
cases
in
which
claimants
are
represented
by
counsel.
but
i
think
the
question
that
your
honor
is
--
is
posing,
of
the
claimant
who's
approaching
some
point
where
they
are
wondering
what
to
do,
that's
going
to
be
a
claimant
who's
looking
at
a
deadline
for
filing
suit
that
is
probably
still
a
year
and
a
half
or
two
years
away
in
typical
cases.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
well,
i
mean,
granted
all
statutes
of
limitations
do
impose
some
obligation
on
would-be
plaintiffs
to
take
steps
to
protect
themselves.
that
--
that
is
true
of
all
limitations
periods
no
matter
how
they
are
drawn.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
in
the
group
--
in
the
group
benefit
plans
of
the
type
that
are
subject
to
erisa,
that
is
very
common.
that
is
the
standard
term.
going
back
to
the
older
products
like
fire
insurance,
life
insurance,
and
so
on,
it
would
often
run
before
proof
of
loss,
from
the
actual
insured
event.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
exactly.
and
with
--
the
reason
why
it's
different
in
a
long-term
disability
plan
is
that
you
have
to
make
sure
that
the
disability
is
actually
a
long-term
disability.
and
so
that's
why
you
have
these
elimination
periods
followed
by
a
proof
of
loss
deadline,
because
there
has
to
be
a
sustained
disability
in
that
interim
period.
and
so
you
don't
run
it
from
an
earlier
point
because
it's
not
clear
that
the
insured
event
has
occurred
until
you've
come
to
that
point.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
i
think
what
i
meant
by
that
was
under
what
i
take
your
honor
to
mean
by
an
accrual
rule,
meaning
a
limitation
period
that
runs--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--at
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
process,
we
don't
know
at
the
time
that
the
claim
is
initially
presented
when
that's
going
to
be.
is
it
going
to
be
6
months
from
now?
a
year
from
now?
a
year
and
a
half
from
now?
and
so
it's
simply
for
reserving
purposes,
it
helps
to
have
a
greater
sense
of
certainty
about
the
timing
of
potential
claims
and
when
we
can
close
the
books.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
correct.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
no.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
the--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--the
--
that
trouble
--
that
would
cause
trouble
for
every
employer,
plan
sponsor,
insurer
that
has
an
erisa
plan.
and
here's
why.
since
erisa's
enactment,
this
court
has
never
held
that
in
a
suit
to
enforce
the
terms
of
an
erisa
plan
those
terms
can
be
thrown
out
the
window
because
we
worry
that
they
might
be
unfair
in
some
case
that
we
can
speculate
about.
that
would
be
a
very
significant
shift
in
how
this
court
enforces
erisa
plans,
and
it
would
undermine
congress's
goal
of
wanting
to
assure
employers
and
plan
sponsors
that
the
terms
on
which
they
agree
to
provide
benefits
will
be
respected.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
it
is.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
it's--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--it
is
in
the
contract.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
well,
but
even
when
it
is
the
court's
creation
it
is
not
without
exceptions;
it
is
not
jurisdictional.
we
like
exhaustion;
we
think
--
we
think
that
internal
review
is
a
very
successful
and
workable
scheme
that
resolves
the
vast
majority
of
cases
with
mutual
benefits
to
all
sides.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
that's
--
that's
correct,
for
good
reason,
although
with
exceptions.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
that's
true.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
that's
true.
but
it
is
not
one
that
required
setting
aside
or
defeating
any
term
of
an
erisa
plan.
and
that's
the
key
distinction.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
and
as
the
party
that
has
come
forward
to
say
that
even
though
i
am
trying
to
enforce
this
plan,
i
nevertheless
want
to
jettison
the
plan
terms,
i
think
the
petitioner
bears
a
burden
to
say
there
is
some
anchor
in
the
statute
or
some
basis
in
evidence
or
experience
to
say,
not
simply
to
speculate,
that
there
is
a
potential
clash
with
the
remedial
scheme,
but
that
there
is
one.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
think
if
there
is
a
--
if
there
is
a
question
as
between
a
judge-made
doctrine
and
the
terms
of
a
plan
as
to
which
should
give
way,
i
think
congress
has
made
clear
that
it
is
the
terms
of
the
plan
that
ought
to
control,
as
have
the
courts
made
clear.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
think
the
courts
that
found
an
exhaustion
requirement
did
so
in
an
act
of
statutory
interpretation
and
found
that
to
be
consistent
with
congress's
intent
in
the
statute.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
in
a
--
in
a
suit
under
section
1132(a)(1)(b)
to
enforce
a
plan
term,
there
is
no
decision
in
which
this
court
has
said
we
can
simply
ignore
plan
terms.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
no.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
no.
there
are
no
--
there
have
been
plenty
of
cases
where
people
have
asked
to
do
so,
and
where
this
court
has
had
to
say
--
for
example
in
the
--
in
the
amara
case,
in
the
mccutchen
case,
in
the
kennedy
case,
where
the
court
had
to
consider
situations
where
maybe
we
should
come
up
with
a
judge-made
sort
of
common
law
model
that
seems
like
a
better
rule.
and
the
court
said
no;
we
are
not
going
to
do
that
because
this
is
a
situation,
this
is
a
context
where
congress
wanted
plan
terms
to
control.
here
the
plan
terms
clearly
bar
the
suit.
there's
no
allegation
that
the
--
the
administrative
regime
here
was--
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
i
--
well,
i
doubt
very
much
you
would
ever
encounter
a
plan
term.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
right.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
yes.
i
suppose
if
you
had
an
intransigent
plan
that
just
said
no,
we
refuse
to
entertain
your
attempts
to
appeal,
that
is
a
situation
where
a
court
would
apply
one
of
the
futility
exceptions
to
exhaustion.
so
i
--
i
don't
think
that
would
--
would
present
an
issue.
ms.
catherine
m.a.
carroll
thank
you.
