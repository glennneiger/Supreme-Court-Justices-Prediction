justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
--
what
happens
if
you
brought
suit
before
the
exhaustion,
while
it
was
still
going
on,
before
it
ended,
but
you
said
to
the
judge,
judge,
we're
in
the
middle
of
exhausting,
so
don't
--
we
don't
want
to
hear
the
case
until
that's
finished;
can
you
do
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
an
open
question.
so
then
if
it
were
held
that
you
could
do
it,
you
could
file
the
lawsuit
within
the
three
years
and
if
exhaustion
had
not
taken
place,
well,
just
don't
hear
the
case
until
the
exhaustion
is
done.
that
would
solve
your
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
solve
your
problem
because
you
waited
too
long.
but
i
mean
that
would
solve
the
problem
of
other
people
in
the
future
in
your
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
that
stops
that?
i
mean,
on
that
ground
you
would
say
these
clauses
are
valid.
it's
valid
to
say
he
has
to
--
you
have
to
bring
a
lawsuit
within
three
years.
nothing
wrong
with
that.
file
a
protective
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--our
saying
that,
and
what
about
our
saying
to
the
courts
as
a
judge-made
doctrine,
exhaustion
has
to
conclude
in
enough
time
so
that
they
have
time
left
to
file
a
lawsuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
because
isn't
--
isn't
exhaustion
a
judge-made
doctrine?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
an
unfair
process
that
doesn't
leave
them
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
file
a
lawsuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suppose
the
problem
here
is
that
we
have
found
nine
cases
--
you
know,
we
can
do
computer-assisted
research,
which
my
clerks
are
good
at
--
and
--
and
they
found
five
cases
in
which
the
exhaustion
period
was
actually
longer
than
the
3-year
statute
of
limitations;
and
then
they
found
four
others
that
there
--
well,
there
was
like
5
days
left
in
one,
and
there
was
5
months
left
in
another.
and
in
most
of
--
almost
all
those
cases,
the
judge
got
around
the
problem
by
saying
the
statute
begins
to
run
at
the
time
the
exhaustion
is
finished.
now,
i
can
think
of
other
ways
of
solving
the
problem.
one
was,
you
get
a
reg.
another
way
was
that
we
interpret
the
exhaustion
doctrine
to
require
leaving
at
least
a
year.
but
what's
your
way
of
solving
the
problem?
are
you
just
going
to
let
those
nine
people
just
--
they
can't
bring
their
lawsuit,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
was,
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
those
nine
people?
now,
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
erisa
cases,
but
still
there
were
nine
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
will
have
this
problem.
and
my
question
is,
what
do
you
suggest
we
do
about
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
was,
what
specific
doctrine
or
--
i
saw
three
groups.
now,
you
can
name
some
others,
and
we
do
about
those
nine
people
precisely,
not
in
some
general
terms,
but
we
do
what
about
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now,
i
suppose
--
so
we
could
use
equitable
estoppel,
even
though
nobody
has
said
anything,
even
though
nobody
held
out
anything
as
a
basis
for
estoppel.
but
we
could
say
use
equitable
estoppel.
i'll
think
about
that
one.
is
there
any
other
thing
we
could
use?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there,
your
opponent
is
saying:
i
have
a
simpler
answer.
i
mean,
instead
of
having
to
worry
whether
14
months
is
too
long
or
7
months
is
too
short
or
a
year
and
a
half
is
adequate
time,
instead
of
having
to
worry
about
that
in
difficult
cases,
i
have
a
simpler
idea.
we
will
just
run
the
three
years
from
the
time
the
--
the
internal
exhaustion
is
finished.
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
equitable
tolling,
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
all
this
other
stuff.
that's
their
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
they
do
that,
the
question
answers
itself.
the
--
the--
[laughter]
the
--
the
question
i
would
like
to
know
is
if
you
know
empirically,
roughly,
what
are
typical
statutes
of
limitations
in
this
area?
the
basic
rule
is
state
law
unless
contract;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
long
on
average?
do
you
have
any
idea
of
--
of
how
long
people
normally
have
to
bring
their
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
standard
provision
in
contracts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean
--
in
certain
types
of
insurance
contracts.
so
erisa
is
all
over
the
place.
i
wouldn't
even
know
where
to
start.
does
the
department
of
labor
keep
statistics
on
this
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
--
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
is
a
judge-created
doctrine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore
you
cannot,
in
your
contract,
contract
yourself
around
it.
you
can't
get
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
this
would
require
would
be
to
say
that
that
judge-created
doctrine
requires
exhaustion
to
take
place
before
the
accrual
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
end
of
opinion
--
for
the
reason
of
certainty,
for
the
reason
of
uniformity,
for
the
reason
of
avoiding,
through
hiring
lawyers,
et
cetera,
an
interference
with
the
voluntary
nature,
simple
nature,
and
hopefully
pre-legal
involvement
nature
of
that
exhaustion
process,
all
right?
da,
da,
da.
now,
the
reason
--
what
trouble
would
that
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
trouble
in
the
industry
would
that
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
you
agree
that
we
would
overturn
the
plan
term
if
the
plan
term
was
no
exhaustion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
courts
would
overturn
a
plan
term
which
plan
term
said
no
exhaustion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
not,
because
what
we
are
trying
to
do
--
and
employers
are
very
cooperative
and
we
are
trying
to
work
out
a
system
with
the
exhaustion
thing
that
will
not
destroy
erisa
plans
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
--
it's
which
is
the
--
and
that's
why
i
phrased
it
in
terms
of
an
explanation
of
the
exhaustion
requirement.
