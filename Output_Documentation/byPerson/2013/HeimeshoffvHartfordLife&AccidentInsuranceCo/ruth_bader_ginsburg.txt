how
much
time
was
left
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
--
and
if
there
were
a
one-year
limitation
running
from
the
final
administrative
review,
you
would
be
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
if
there
were
such
a
rule,
one
year
from
the
final
administrative
decision,
this
claim
would
become
too
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
accounts
for
the
delay?
when
the
--
the
clock
was
running
and
more
than
a
year
went
by
before
this
suit
was
instituted.
why
was
that
--
why
did
that
happen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
erisa
itself
contains
no
statute
of
limitations,
and
it's
generally
assumed
that,
therefore,
this
state
statute
of
limitations
would
govern,
and
if
a
state
has
the
position
that
parties
can
contract
the
statute
of
limitations
--
i
mean,
erisa
does
have
--
does
have
a
statute
of
limitations
for
breach
of
fiduciary
claims,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
has
none
for
this
kind
of
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
understand
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
mr.
wessler.
i
don't
see
how
a
court
who
simply
stays
its
--
stays
its
hand,
abides
the
termination
of
the
administrative
proceeding,
is
in
any
way
engaging
in
any
kind
of
adversary
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
many
people
in
the
administrative
process
aren't
represented,
but
some
are,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
in
practice
--
in
practice,
how
often
is
that
the
case
that
the
--
that
the
guidelines
set
by
the
department
of
labor
are
not
--
are
not
met?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
ms.
anders,
the
question
is
--
there
is
a
division
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
question
is:
could
the
department
of
labor
by
regulation
resolve
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other?
does
--
even
if
--
even
if
it
thinks
the
statute
is
clear,
the
courts
obviously
don't,
because
most
go
the
other
way.
so
given
that
most
courts
go
the
other
way,
does
the
department
of
labor
have
authority
to
adopt
a
--
a
regulation
that
would
adopt
the
accrual
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
position
on
justice
breyer's
suggestion
that
the
trigger
can
be
proof
--
when
you
file
proof
of
claim,
but
if
it
happens
that
beginning
of
suit
at
that
point
would
--
while
the
--
while
the
administrative
review
process
is
underway,
why
not
say
you
have
to
follow
the
time
of
filing,
but
if
the
administrative
process
--
in
your
case,
the
4
years
--
took
4
years
--
just
hold
the
suit
in
abeyance
until
the
administrative
process
is
complete?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
true
that
in
insurance
contracts
generally,
where
there
is
this
proof
of
loss
as
the
trigger,
there
isn't
a
mandatory
administrative?
most
states
don't
have
this
mandatory
administrative
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
carroll,
did
i
understand
you
before
to
be
taking
the
position
that
even
if
congress
enacted
a
statute
of
limitations
with
an
accrual
rule,
that
that
might
not
be
effective
as
against
a
plan
provision
that
provides
for
the
trigger
being
proof
of
claim?
