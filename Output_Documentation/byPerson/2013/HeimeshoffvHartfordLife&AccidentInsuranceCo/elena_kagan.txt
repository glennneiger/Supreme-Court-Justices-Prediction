mr.
wessler,
this
just
i
think
follows
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
but
have
you
identified
any
cases
in
which
this
serves
to
prevent
somebody
from
bringing
a
suit?
justice
elena
kagan
but
it
seems
as
though
those
courts
have
been
pretty
liberal
in
saying,
whenever
it
is
necessary,
no,
take
a
little
bit
more
time.
so
it
seems
just
a
little
bit
like
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem.
justice
elena
kagan
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
any
bad
incentives
--
you
know,
any
bad
effects
are
actually
flowing
from
this?
there's
actually
a
big
leeway
in
this
statute,
because
it's
3
years.
the
administrative
review
process
only
takes
about
a
year.
even
if
this
is
a
--
it's
a
complicated
case
where
there's
some
tolling,
you
know,
maybe
it
gets
you
up
to
another
year;
you
still
have
a
year.
i
mean,
what
--
how
would
people
behave
badly
or
behave
in
ways
that
you
think
would
disrupt
the
statutory
scheme,
if
we
just
let
everything
stay
as
it
is?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
one
question
is:
if
you
think
that
you
do
have
authority
and
you
think
that
the
majority
rule
has
been
creating
problems,
why
the
department
of
labor
hasn't
done
that?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
carroll,
what
would
you
think
if
the
state
here
just
amended
its
statutes
tomorrow
and
said
not
3
years
but
18
months?
so
for
everybody,
it's
an
18-month
period.
it
doesn't
give
people
very
long
after
the
12
or
13
months
of
the
administrative
review
process
is
over.
what
should
a
court
do
then?
should
a
court
strike
the
entire
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
should
the
court
say,
that's
unreasonable,
that
goes
too
far?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
you
know
what?
take
it
out
of
the
statute
context.
just
say
that
the
contract
said
18
months
rather
--
so
--
so
that's
really
what
i
meant.
what
is
--
what's
a
court
to
do
with
a
contract
that
says
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
in
18
months.
and
so
18
--
the
administrative
review
process
takes
about
12
months
in
most
cases.
justice
elena
kagan
is
18
months
enough?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what's
the
rule
of
law
--
what's
the
rule
of
law
that
allows
to
get
rid
of
a
contract
provision
that's
set
at
14
months
or
15
months
or
16
months
and
to
leave
this
one?
justice
elena
kagan
i
was
thinking
that
i
would
like
to
--
like,
14
months
would
just
seem
unreasonable
to
me.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
carroll,
please
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
but
even
if
a
contract
does
not
have
an
exhaustion
requirement,
courts
have
required
exhaustion.
justice
elena
kagan
and
courts
have
required
it
even
though
the
statute
doesn't
say
so.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
an
extra-textual
requirement
the
courts
have
made
up,
irrespective
of
what
the
contract
provides.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
what
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
that
maybe,
given
that
we
have
this
sort
of
judge-made
rule
of
exhaustion,
that
the
courts
just
did
sort
of
a
half
job
of
it,
that
they
also
should
have
put
the
statute
of
limitations
that
makes
that
exhaustion
requirement
work,
and
that
ensures
that
it
doesn't
produce
unfair,
bad
outcomes.
justice
elena
kagan
the
congress
was
dealing
--
you
know,
congress
passed
erisa
before
this
exhaustion
requirement
came
into
play.
so
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
read
into
anything,
to
read
congress's
silence
in
the
normal
way
here,
because
congress
didn't
think
that
there
was
going
to
be
this
exhaustion
requirement--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
the
courts
put
it
on
later.
