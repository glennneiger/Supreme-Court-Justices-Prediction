justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
erisa
doesn't
have
a
statute
of
limitations,
it
doesn't
specifically
set
out
a
statute
of
limitations
for
this
type
of
claim.
but
it
does
have
a
savings
clause
that
says
it
doesn't
preempt
state
laws
that
regulate
insurance.
so
what
would
happen
in
this
situation?
let's
say
that
a
state
statute
says
essentially
what
the
plan
at
issue
says.
it
says
that
a
claim
for
the
incorrect
denial
of
insurance
benefits
must
be
brought
within
three
years
after
the
proof
of
loss.
and
now
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you,
that
under
erisa,
any
statute
of
limitations
for
the
denial
of
benefits
must
begin
not
when
the
proof
of
loss
must
be
filed,
but
upon
the
denial
of
benefits.
does
it
follow,
then,
that
the
rule
that
you're
advocating
would
mean
that
erisa
preempted
the
state
law
that
regulated
insurance
in
the
way
that
i
just
specified?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
yes;
otherwise,
the
situation
would
be
a
mess.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
--
but
in
--
in
what
sense
is
the
law
that
i
hypothesize
not
a
law
that
regulates
insurance?
so
why
wouldn't
it
fall
within
erisa's
savings
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
find
it
very
hard
to
answer
the
question
that
is
presented
here
without
knowing
the
answer
to
the
preemption
question
that
i
asked
mr.
wessler.
and
i
know
you
refer
to
it
in
a
footnote
in
your
brief
and
you
say
that
this
--
the
type
of
state
statute
to
which
i
referred
would
likely
be
preempted.
and
i
can
understand
why
you
wouldn't
want
to
go
further
than
that
on
that
question
in
a
case
where
that
question
isn't
squarely
presented.
but
if
it's
not
presented,
then
i
think
we
would
be
creating
an
incredible
mess
that
congress
would
not
have
intended.
so
i
really
don't
understand
how
i
can
answer
the
question
here
without
knowing
the
answer
to
the
question
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
agree
with
you,
would
a
state
legislature
have
the
authority
to
pass
a
statute
setting
out
a
particular
--
a
specific
statute
of
limitations
for
erisa
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
--
why
would
employers
with
erisa
plans
be
hurt
by
the
rule
that
the
petitioner
is
advocating
going
forward?
why
wouldn't
they
just
be
then
able
to
amend
the
plan,
make
the
--
the
period
for
filing
suit
begin
on
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
review
process,
shorten
the
period,
if
--
so
as
to
bring
it
in
line
with
basically
what
happened
before,
when
the
period
began
upon
the
proof
of
loss.
i
don't
quite
understand
why,
going
forward,
that
is
--
is
a
disadvantage
to
--
to
employers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
current
model
being
the
proof
of
loss?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
why
is
that
preferable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
started
to
answer
this
question
before,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
answer:
why
this
proof
of
loss
model
is
--
is
so
attractive
in
the
disability
insurance
field.
you
said
that
it
provides
a
clear
date
on
which
you
know
you
can
begin
to
count.
but
so
does
an
accrual
rule.
so
maybe
you
can
explain
a
little
bit
more.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
right,
right.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
we
agree
with
you,
would
the
federal
courts
and
maybe
ultimately
this
court
in
the
end
have
to
specify
what
the
statute
of
limitations
is,
the
length
of
time?
so
we
have
a
bunch
of
cases
from
different
courts,
and
one
circuit
says
2
years
is
--
is
the
--
that's
the
shortest
you
can
have.
another
one
says,
no,
you
can
have
a
year.
another
one
says,
well,
you
could
have
9
months.
how
would
this
ultimately
happen?
wouldn't
we
be
driven
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
specify
a
lot
of
different
lengths,
and
then
they're
all
challenged
--
different
ones
are
challenged
in
different
courts,
and
the
courts
have
to
say
what's
reasonable.
and
there's
no
state
statute
of
limitations
that
applies
to
this
situation.
so
it
all
comes
down
just
to
a
question
of
reasonableness.
