justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not
agree,
then,
that
if
you
know
that
there's
--
that
there's
a
bank
robbery
afoot
and
you're
cooperating
in
that,
you're
--
you're
the
wheelman,
and
you
also
know
that
the
--
you
know
that
the
people
who
are
conducting
the
bank
robbery
are
carrying
firearms,
you
say
that
there's
no
criminal
liability
for
the
firearms
unless
you
intended
them
to
use
the
firearms;
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait.
it
would
support
a
verdict
--
you're
saying
it
would
support
a
finding
of
--
of
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
there's
a
lot
of
evidence
that
he
didn't
really
want
them
to
use
firearms,
that
there's
no
way
you
can
say
he
intended
them
to
use,
but
he
knew
that
they
had
firearms.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
no,
no,
you
can't.
it's
my
hypothetical.
and
you
cannot
conclude
from
that.
there
is
so
much
other
evidence.
this
--
this
man
hates
firearms.
he
does
not
like
firearms.
there
is
no
way
he
could
have
intended
them
to
use
firearms.
but
he
knew
they
had
firearms.
justice
antonin
scalia
facilitate
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
so
if
you
intend
a
crime
--
if
you
intend
a
crime
and
you
know
that
the
crime
is
being
conducted
with
firearms,
that's
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
beforehand.
before
--
you
know
beforehand
that
the
crime
is
going
to
be
perpetrated
with
firearms.
that's
all
you
do.
you
know
beforehand,
and
you
facilitate
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
ever
harmless
error
to
not
instruct
the
jury
--
or
to
instruct
the
jury
not
to
find
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
if,
indeed,
intent
is
necessary,
it
seems
to
me
he
has
to
instruct
the
jury
to
find
intent.
it's
not
up
to
the
court
to
say,
well,
there
surely
was
intent
anyway
so
it's
harmless
error.
the
jury
has
to
find
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
you
don't
need
prior
knowledge.
i
think
you
need
prior
knowledge.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
did
you
mean
by
--
by
you
don't
need
prior
knowledge?
justice
antonin
scalia
after
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
--
did
he
facilitate
the
crime
after
the
shots
were
fired?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
crime
of
conviction
was
--
was
a
drug
offense
with
the
use
of
a
firearm,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
the
law
is
pretty
clear
that
if
you
--
if
you
facilitate
an
offense,
you
do
not
have
to
facilitate
each
element
of
that
offense,
so
long
as
you
have
knowledge
that
that
element
existed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
more
precisely,
they
could
be
asked
did
he
facilitate
the
drug
deal
knowing
that
a
firearm
was
going
to
be
used
in
the
drug
deal.
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
your
position
is.
he
has
to
use
the
gun
himself?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
only
--
you
say
it's
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
what
you
would
ask
the
jury
to
find
is
intent,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
to
find
those
facts
that
were
stated
by
justice
kennedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
addition,
the
jury
would
have
to
find
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
do
you
say
--
you
say
in
context,
it
was
okay.
what
--
what
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
it?
just
that?
"in
order
to
aid
or
abet
another
to
commit
a
crime,
it
is
necessary
that
the
defendant
willfully
and
knowingly
associated
himself
in
some
way
with
the
crime.
"
