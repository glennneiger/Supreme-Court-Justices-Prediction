justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
give
me
an
example
of
that.
give
us--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
the
example.
the
--
the
alleged
aider
and
abetter
learns
about
this
after
it's
happened?
that's
the
idea?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
change
--
let
me
--
maybe
this
is
the
same
as
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
but
let
me
try
it.
suppose
that
two
guys
have
a
meeting
and
it's
--
it's
in
a
place
that's
--
where
there's
an
electronic
eavesdropping
device.
in
fact,
there's
a
camera.
so
it's
all
recorded.
so
we
know
exactly
what
was
said.
and
the
principal
says,
here's
the
deal,
i'm
going
to
rob
a
convenience
store
and
i'm
going
to
carry
a
gun.
and
the
aider
and
abetter
says,
well,
all
right.
i'm
in
on
the
--
you
know,
i'm
in
on
robbing
the
convenience
store,
but
i
don't
want
anything
having
to
do
with
the
gun.
i
think
you
should
carry
a
baseball
bat.
the
principal
says,
no,
that's
the
deal.
i'm
robbing
the
store.
i'm
carrying
a
gun.
take
it
or
leave
it.
are
you
going
to
drive
me
there?
and
--
and
the
other
guy
says,
i
hate
guns,
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
guns.
i
--
i
hate
this
idea
about
the
guns.
they
go
back
and
forth.
and
the
--
the
principal
says
finally,
look,
this
is
it.
this
is
the
deal.
i'm
using
a
gun.
are
you
going
to
help
me
or
not?
and
the
guy
says,
well,
all
right.
i'm
going
to
drive
you,
but
i
want
it
noted
for
the
record
that
i'm
opposed
--
i'm
opposed
to
the
use
of
a
gun.
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
see
--
so
i
don't
really
see
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
think
of
a
situation
where
a
person
facilitates
the
crime,
knows
what
the
crime
is
going
to
be,
knows
that
a
gun
is
going
to
be
used
but
doesn't
intend
for
the
gun
to
be
used.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
those
two
situations,
knowledge
and
intent,
seem
to
me
to
be
--
to
be
the
same
thing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
your
hypotheticals.
if
you
could
give
it
to
us
again.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
facilitate--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--or
in
my
--
in
my
hypothetical,
could
a
rational
jury
say
he
knew
about
it,
but
he
didn't
intend
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
my
case
--
and
i'll
finish.
i
want
to
ask
another
question
about
this.
but
in
my
case,
if
the
judge
had
given
the
instruction,
it's
enough
that
he
knew
about
it.
he
facilitated
the
crime
when
he
knew
there
was
a
gun.
would
that
be
error?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
your
argument
about
intent,
but
are
you
also
arguing
that
the
--
that
the
actus
reus
instruction
was
insufficient?
the
instruction
about
what
your
client
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
necessary
for
an
aider
and
abetter
to
facilitate
every
element
of
a
criminal
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
there
were
not
--
if
the
--
the
drug
offense
were
not
illegal,
there
--
there
wasn't
a
drug
offense
and
then
the
--
the
additional
firearm
element,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
for
him
--
for
the
defendant
to
facilitate
every
element
of
that
offense.
it's
dependent
on
the
fact
that
there's
this
other
criminal
conduct.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
go
back
to
my
earlier
hypothetical
about
the
taped
conversation.
suppose
that
the
alleged
aider
and
abetter
there
says,
i
intend
for
you
to
use
the
gun.
i
have
that
intent.
however,
i'm
not
going
to
do
one
thing
to
help
you
get
the
gun
or
use
the
gun.
i
don't
want
to
--
i'm
not
going
to.
there's
an
actus
reus
problem
there
because
he
doesn't
facilitate
the
use
of
the
gun?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
the
defendant
here
have
--
could
the
defendant
here
have
been
convicted
of
possession
of
the
ammunition
on
the
theory
that
--
under
the
instructions
--
would
the
instructions
have
allowed
that
conviction
on
the
theory
that
the
defendant
aided
and
abetted
somebody
else's
possession
of
the
ammunition?
