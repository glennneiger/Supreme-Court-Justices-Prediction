chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-895,
rosemond
v.
united
states.
mr.
elwood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
--
is
it
just
flight?
i
thought
there
was
evidence
that
they
were
chasing
the
people
who
robbed
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
jumps
in
the
car
and,
you
know,
they're
going
after
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
--
it
might
be
an
effort
to
continue
the
crime
of
--
in
other
words,
it
might
make
a
difference
whether
the
people
who
are
being
chased
look
and
see
two
guys
in
the
car
or
three
guys
in
the
car.
if
somebody
says
--
and
i
realize
you
dispute
these
facts
--
let's
go
get
them
and
the
guy
jumps
in
the
car,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
aiding
and
abetting
the
underlying
illegal
activity
with
knowledge,
of
course,
that
guns
were
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bash.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
very
fanciful
hypothetical,
because
the
one
thing
the
guard
is
going
to
know,
that
if
the
robber
gets
caught,
he's
in
great
jeopardy
of
--
of
being
caught
himself
and
convicted.
of
course
he
wants
the
crime
to
succeed
because
he
doesn't
want
the
people
to
be
there
and
being
pressured
by
investigators
or
whatever
to
say,
okay,
you
know,
who
was
in
on
--
who
was
in
on
this
with
you?
so
if
you're
--
if
you're
being
paid
for
a
crime,
to
assist
in
the
commission
of
the
crime,
you
want
it
to
succeed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
has
a
stake
in
it.
if
the
guy
is
caught,
the
police
are
going
to
say,
where
did
you
get
the
gun?
he
may
turn
him
in
or
not,
but
it's
certainly
a
danger,
a
danger
that
wouldn't
be
there
if
the
crime
succeeded.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
proposed
--
he
proposed
a
different
instruction
that
departed
from
the
instruction
that
was
given
on
that
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
two
--
two
wrongs
don't
make
a
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what's
the
point
of
charging
him
with
possession
of
the
gun
and
possession
of
the
bullets
in
the
gun?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
proof
would
be
pretty
much
the
same.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess,
then,
the
question
is:
what's
the
point
of
charging
him
with
possession
of
the
bullets
if
you're
not
charging
him
with
possession
of
the
gun?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
would--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
would
never
--
if
you
got
a
call
from
the
u.s.
--
assistant
u.s.
attorney
in
the
field
said,
this
is
the
instruction
i'm
going
to
use,
you
would
tell
him,
no,
don't
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
you
have
arguments
about
failure
to
object
and
harmless
error.
but
on
the
substance
of
it,
you
think
the
instruction
--
you
would
never
counsel
someone
to
give
that
instruction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
“
make
the
crime
succeed
”
helps
you
because
you
would
say
the
crime
that
he
has
to
help
make
succeed
is
the
underlying
drug
offense,
not
the
use
of
the
firearm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
elwood,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you
have
anything
for
us
on
rule
30?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
did
you
preserve
that
objection?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
