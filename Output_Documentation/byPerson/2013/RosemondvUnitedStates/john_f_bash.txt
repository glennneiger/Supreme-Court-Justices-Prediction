mr.
john
f.
bash
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
defining
exactly
what
the
government
contends
the
mens
rea
requirement
is
for
aiding
and
abetting,
and
then
give
the
court
an
example
--
two
examples
to
show
how
it
differs
both
from
what
mr.
elwood
is
saying
and
how
it
differs
from
a
knowledge
standard.
aiding
and
abetting
requires
an
intent
to
facilitate
or
encourage
the
commission
of
an
offense.
and
i
think
that
breaks
down
into
two
constituent
parts:
one,
an
intent
to
make
some
action
easier
or
to
encourage
some
action
by
the
principal;
two,
the
knowledge
that
the
principal
intends
to
commit
a
crime
of
which
that
action
is
a
constituent
part.
what
mr.
elwood
is
saying
is
something
quite
different.
it's
that
you
have
to
intend
that
the
crime
succeed.
if
that's
true,
all
paid
accomplices
are
out
if
they
don't
intend
that
the
crime
succeed.
if
the
--
if
the
bank
robbers
say,
hey,
can
you
look
the
other
way,
security
guard,
while
we
go
into
the
bank,
we'll
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
if
you
do
it,
that's
not
aiding
and
abetting
under
his
theory
if
the
security
guard
says,
well,
i
only
wanted
a
thousand
dollars;
i
didn't
care
whether
you
ultimately
succeeded
in
the
bank.
we
give
an
example
in
our
brief:
if
the
person
actually
gives
the
gun
so
it
meets
the
actus
reus
requirement
that
mr.
elwood
has
proposed,
he
actually
gives
the
gun
to
somebody,
not
because
he
cares
if
that
person
commits
the
crime,
which
he
knows
he
intends
to
commit,
but
as
a
favor
for
his
friend--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--well,
if
your
payment
is
not
coming
from
the
loot,
i
don't
think
that's
really
true.
but
let's
take
that
as
true
as
given.
i
mean,
go
back
to
my
example
about
the
guy
that's
just
doing
a
favor
for
somebody.
sure,
you
can
use
my
gun
to
commit
a
robbery.
i
don't
have
any
stake
in
it.
if
you
decide
tomorrow
that
you
don't
want
to
commit
the
robbery,
that's
fine
with
me.
mr.
john
f.
bash
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
the
sort
of
intent
requirement
that
mr.
elwood
is
talking
about.
i
mean,
i
think
he's
talking
about
an
intent
that's
abstracted
from
the
idea
that
if
you
get
caught,
everybody
might
go
to
jail.
i
mean,
that
sort
of
seems
to
beg
the
question
of
whether
you're
actually
going
to
be
liable
for
the
gun.
mr.
john
f.
bash
it's
not
proving
no
more
than
the
48-month
charge.
and
i'll
just
--
as
a
footnote,
it's
10
years
only
if
the
gun
is
fired.
it's
5
years
if
it's
carried
or
used,
and
which
obviously
creates
a
much
greater
danger
to
people's
lives
and
property
if
it's
fired.
but
it's
not
only
proving
that
you
facilitated
the
drug
offense.
it's
facilitating
the
drug
offense
with
the
foreknowledge
that
a
gun
was
going
to
be
involved
in
it.
mr.
john
f.
bash
justice
kennedy,
two
points.
mr.
john
f.
bash
justice
kennedy,
that
is
an
odd
interpretation
and
it's
wrong
and
we
do
not
contend
that
liability
could
be
imposed
if
you
learned
of
the
gun
only
after
your
participation
ended.
a
couple
points
on
that.
mr.
john
f.
bash
well,
i
don't
think
read
in
the
context
of
the
full
instruction.
if
you
look
at--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--oh,
so
not
the
instruction
taken
by
itself,
but
one
phrase
in
the
instruction
taken
by
itself?
mr.
john
f.
bash
i
think
it's
possible,
but
i
think
if
you
read
it
in
the
context
of
the
full
charge
and
what
reasonable
jurors
would
think,
you
have
the
formulation
right
above
that
on
page
196
that
mirrors
exactly
the
peoni
standard.
and
i
don't
think
reasonable
jurors
reading
that
in
conjunction
with
the
more
specific
instruction
on
count
2
could
think
that
he
could
be
liable
if
his
participation
ended
only
after
the
firearm
was
used.
and,
justice
kennedy,
nobody
below
thought
that,
because
petitioner
never
objected
on
the
grounds
that
the
particular
wording
of
this
instruction
allowed
conviction
if
you
gained
knowledge
only
after
your
participation.
so
at
minimum--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all,
under
rule
30
it
is
not
enough
to
propose
an
alternative
instruction
that
does
not
contain
the
defect.
you
have
to
lay
out
the
specific
grounds
for
your
objection.
he
did
not
do
that
here,
so
it
should
be
plain
error
review.
that
is
doubly
true
here
where
his
instruction
had
its
own
error.
his
instruction
would
have
required
intentional
facilitation
of
the
gun,
which
is
the
question
on
this
court
granted
certiorari.
his
instruction
had--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--two
wrongs
don't
make
a
right,
but
he
certainly
did
not
comply
with
the
rule
30
standard
for
raising
the
objection
with
respect
to
foreknowledge
that
he
--
that
he's
proposing
now.
so,
at
minimum,
that
should
be
reviewed
for
plain
error.
in
addition,
even
if
the
court
believes
that
we
waived
the
harmless
error
argument
by
not
raising
it
below
with
respect
to
his
primary
argument,
the
court
should
certainly
hear
our
plain
error
--
or
harmless
error
argument
with
respect
to
the
ammunition
counts,
with
respect
to
the
instructional
error
that
he
did
not
raise
below.
we
should
have
the
opportunity--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--it
would
be--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--i
think
the
only
way
petitioner
fits
that
instruction
into
his
view
of
the
law
is
because
the
driver
started
out
driving
the
people
to
the
bank,
so
he
says,
oh,
well,
you
are
satisfying
my
actus
reus
requirement
because
you
actually
transported
the
guns
to
the
bank.
but
tweak
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit.
suppose
the
getaway
driver
is
paid
only
to
show
up
at
the
end
and
to,
you
know,
ferry
the
bank
robbers
away.
he
knows
all
along
that
it's
going
to
be
a
firearm
offense.
i'm
pretty
sure
mr.
elwood
would
say:
because
you
took
no
act
facilitating
the
gun
in
that
case,
you
only
sort
of
showed
up
at
the
end,
even
though
you
knew
a
gun
would
be
used,
that
that's
not
facilitation.
so
i
take
your
point,
justice
kennedy,
that
in
a
wide
swath
of
cases
it
may
not
matter,
but
i
think
in
some
cases
it
is
going
to
matter.
and
--
take
his
intent
requirement.
i
mean,
the
person
that
lends
the
gun
just
to
be
a
good
guy,
not
because
he
cares
about
the
offense,
i'm
pretty
sure
he
is
out.
and
if
the
jury
is
convinced,
hey,
i
knew
he
was
going
to
commit
a
robbery
or
assault
but
i
just
did
not
care,
if
the
jury
is
convinced
by
that,
he
is
acquitted,
and
that
can't
possibly
be
right.
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
any
924(c)
offense
at
all.
i
mean
not
only
the
ten-year--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--if
he
continued
participating
after
he
learned
of
the
gun,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
bash
yes.
mr.
john
f.
bash
if
he
learned
of
the
gun
and
said,
hey,
i'm
out
of
this,
he's
not
guilty.
mr.
john
f.
bash
well,
i--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--i
think
it's
more
qualitative
than
that
and
the
question
suggests
it's
purely
quantitative.
it's
qualitative
in
the
sense
that
the
facilitation
can
relate
to
either
element.
so
it
can
relate
to
the
gun
in
particular
or
--
and
this
could
be
the
guy
that
set
up
the
drug
deal
knowing
that
a
gun
would
be
involved,
or
set
up
the
robbery
knowing
that
a
gun
would
be
involved.
i
think
you
see
in
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
here
the
practical
difficulties
that
come
in
because,
although
most
court
of
appeals,
i
think
eight,
have
technically
adopted
the
position
that
you
have
to
facilitate
the
gun
in
a
direct
way,
if
you
look
a
the
actual
holdings
of
the
cases
it
doesn't
differ
in
practical
application
from
our
approach.
it's
--
there
is
one
case,
i
think
it's
price
out
of
the
third
circuit,
where
the
guy
may
have
learned
of
the
gun
--
i
may
have
the
case
name
wrong,
but
the
guy
learned
of
the
gun
only
as
the
robbery
was
--
was
taking
place,
but
he
continued
to
participate
in
the
robbery
while
his
confederate
brandished
the
gun,
he
collected
the
money
and
so
forth.
and
as
far
as
your
question
about
the
practical
problems,
i
think
explaining
to
a
jury
what
does
it
mean
to
facilitate
the
gun
in
a
specific
way
during
a
crime
like
that
is
incredibly
difficult.
i
mean,
we
say
in
the
brief:
what
if
you
are
exchanging
the
money
while
the
other
person
is
brandishing
the
firearm?
maybe
that
person--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--we--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--we
agree
that
that
is
law.
mr.
john
f.
bash
if
the
gun
is
drawn
and
the
person
continues
to
facilitate
the
drug
crime
or
the
violent
crime,
that
is
enough.
mr.
john
f.
bash
yeah.
take
this
case.
this
is
an
$800
marijuana
deal.
it's
a
small-scale
drug
deal
that
happens
all
the
time
without
firearms.
as
mr.
elwood
says,
usually
this
kind
of
deal
is
not
done
with
a
firearm;
only
5
percent
of
marijuana
offenses
have
a
firearm.
yes,
if
you
are
on
that
kind
of
small-scale
deal
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
becomes
an
armed
offense,
you
do
have
an
obligation
to
withdraw.
now,
of
course,
i
think
you
might
have
a
duress
defense
if
you
felt
like
if
i
withdraw
i'm
going
to
get
shot,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
john
f.
bash
two
points
on
that.
first,
i
think
a
lot
of
that
would
come
in
through
the
duress
defense.
i
mean,
if
you
really
feel
like,
oh,
my
god,
this
guy
has
a
gun
and
he
might
shoot
me
if
i
withdraw,
it
can
give
a
pretty
solid
duress
defense.
the
other
point
i
would
say
which
is
maybe
a
little
tangential
to
the
hypothetical,
is
there's
a
traditional
doctrine
of
aiding
and
abetting
law.
this
is
at
2.06
of
the
model
penal
code.
it's
in
the
lafave
treatise
and
the
wharton
treatise,
that
if
you
countermand
your
assistance
after
you
have
assisted
but
before
the
crime
is
accomplished
or
completed
--
for
example,
if
your
assistance
was
only
encouraging
and
you
start
discouraging,
or
if
you
take
all
actions
possible
to
prevent
the
crime
--
for
example,
you
assisted,
you
have
a
change
of
heart,
you
call
the
police
to
prevent
the
crime,
you
are
not
liable
for
aiding
and
abetting.
and
i
think
that
reflects
a
broader
point,
which
is
that
the
traditional
common
law
contours
of
aiding
and
abetting
work
pretty
well
with
the
contemporary
purposes
and
problems
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
solve.
i
mean,
this
is
a
statute
about
the
mix
of
guns
and
drugs
or
guns
and
violence.
and
i
don't
see
why
mr.
elwood
contends
that
if
you
assist
one
side
of
that
equation
or
the
other
it
is
a
different
result.
i
think
if
you
assist
either
side
of
that
equation,
knowing
that
the
equation
is
going
to
happen,
by
the
principle,
that
is
aiding
and
abetting.
it's
aiding
and
abetting
under
the
historical
test,
i
think
it's
aiding
and
abetting
under
this
court's
cases,
and
i
don't
see
why
it
would
be
a
different
result
here.
mr.
john
f.
bash
well,
of
course,
the
prosecution's
principal
theory
was
that
he
was
the
gunman;
he
brought
it
along
to
facilitate
his
drug
deal.
but
assuming
the
theory
of
the
facts
that
the
gun
was
fired
after
gonzales
absconded
with
the
drugs,
i
mean,
i
think
one
way
to
think
about
it
is
like
this:
suppose
that
what
had
happened
is
that
gonzales
had
gotten
ten
paces,
and
petitioner
or
joseph
had
tackled
him
and
immediately
snatched
the
drugs
back.
i
don't
think
this
court
or
courts
generally
would
expect
the
government
to
charge
two
counts
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
for
that
brief
period
in
which
someone
snatches
possession
away
and
you
get
it.
that
wasn't
certainly
what
the
prosecutor
thought
here,
and
it's
obviously
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
only
way
that
question
comes
into
this
case
is
that
mr.
elwood
is
trying
to
say
that
the
prosecutor
understood
that
--
that
you
didn't
need
foreknowledge
of
the
gun.
and
that's
not
what
the
prosecutor
understood.
the
prosecutor
understood
that
this
offense
could
continue
for
at
least
some
period
after
in
which
the
confederates
gave
chase
to
--
to
reclaim
the
drugs.
and
that
may
have
been
a
wrong
theory,
but
no
one
below
ever
understood
that
you
could
be
convicted
if
you
didn't
know
of
the
gun
until
your
participation
ended.
that's
why
petitioner
never
objected
on
that
ground,
and
that's
why,
of
course,
we
submit
that
it
should
be
reviewed
for
plain
error.
mr.
john
f.
bash
yes.
mr.
john
f.
bash
carried
or
used,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
bash
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
judge
never
instructed
that
if
you
aid
and
abet,
that's
is
the
equivalent
of
constructive
possession
of
--
of
the
bullets.
and,
in
fact,
i
mean,
what
constructive
possession
means
is
that
you
have
the
ability
to
exercise
control
over
this
--
over
the
ammunition.
so
it
doesn't
gel
with
his
theory
that,
oh,
i
didn't
know
about
the
gun
until
after
the
shots
were
fired.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
anyone
thought
that
you
could
get
a
conviction
because
the
shells
were
on
the
ground
or
something
and
you
could
pick
them
up
after
they
were
fired.
the
obvious
view
was
that
he
was
--
the
person
who
shot
the
gun
--
and
at
minimum,
i
think
those
convictions,
because
there
were
no
aiding
and
abetting
instructions
on
them,
show
that
he
must
have
known
about
the
gun
ahead
of
time
if
he
could
exercise,
at
minimum,
constructive
possession
over
the
ammunition
fired
from--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--the
proof
--
the
proof
was
the
same
in
this
case.
they
didn't
charge
him
with
possession
of
the
gun.
they
charged
him
with
use
or
carrying
during
and
in
relation
to
the
drug
trafficking
offense.
and
then
there
were
two
counts
of
possession
of
the
ammunition,
which
were
linked
to
his
felony
status
and
his
alien
--
unlawful
alien
status.
mr.
john
f.
bash
it
--
we
could
have
charged
him
with
possession
as
a
felon.
we
didn't.
it's
not
totally
clear
to
me
why
we
didn't.
but
we
certainly
could
have
charged
him
with
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
bash
we
are
saying
that.
i
think
that
--
that
--
that
gels
with
the
historic
law
of
aiding
and
abetting,
which,
as
judge
friendly
said
in
a
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
garguilo,
assistance
of
even
slight
moment
counts.
and--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
that
can
be
right
for
the
examples
i
gave,
paid
accomplices
that
don't
have
a
stake
or
the
person
who
lends
the
gun
to
be
a
good
guy.
and
let
me
contrast
that
--
i
never
got
to
this
example
--
with
what
a
pure
knowledge
standard
would
look
like.
suppose
there
was
looting,
and
the
defendant
breaks
into
the
--
a
store
to
facilitate
his
own
entry
in
the
store
to
steal
goods.
but
he
knows
there's
20
people
coming
behind
him,
and
he
has
now
facilitated
their
entry
into
the
store,
too.
that
is
not
aiding
and
abetting
under
our
theory
because
he
did
not
even
bear
the
intent
to
facilitate,
by
which
we
mean
the
intent
to
make
some
step
in
another
person's
crime
easier.
he
knew
it
would
do
that,
but
that
was
incidental
to
an
intent
to
facilitate
his
own
crime.
so
i
do
think
the
mens
rea
is
significantly
ratcheted
up
from
what
a
pure
knowledge
standard
would
look
like.
mr.
john
f.
bash
yes.
i
think
what
that
formulation
masks
is
exactly
what
intent
to
facilitate
means,
and
i
think
that
might
be
part
of
the
disagreement
among
the
parties.
and
what
we
say
is
that
it
means
an
intent
to
make
some
step
in
what
you
know
is
a
crime
that
he
intend
--
the
principal
intends
to
do
easier.
and
we
think
it's
got
to
be
that.
that's
also
the
formulation
in
the
historical
sources
we
cite
at
page
47
at
footnote
10
of
our
brief.
it's
either
the
intent
to
commit
the
crime
yourself
or
knowledge
that
the
other
person
has
that
intent.
and
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
anything
else.
i
mean,
if
--
if
you
assist
someone
in
a
--
just
to
be
a
good
person,
not
because
you
care
if
the
crime
succeeds,
and
if
you
ask
them
in
--
with
the
truth
serum,
do
you
want
the
crime
to
succeed,
you
say,
well,
i'm
totally
indifferent
to
the
crime.
mr.
john
f.
bash
not--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--in
isolation,
potentially
misleading.
i
think
in
context,
how
reasonable
jurors
would
understand
this
and
how
the
parties
understood
it,
because
nobody
raised
an
objection
to
this
below,
i
think
they
understood
that
your
knowledge
had
to
arise
before
your
completion--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--of
your
participation
in
the
offense.
mr.
john
f.
bash
we
--
we
wouldn't.
but
the
reason
this
court
has
--
or
the
reason
courts
generally
have
objection
rules
is
when
questions
about
particular
verb
tenses
and
phrasings
arise,
the
defendant
or
one
of
the
parties
is
supposed
to
actually
object
to
that
in
the
district
court.
that
didn't
happen
here.
mr.
john
f.
bash
well,
i
think
as
we
said
in
the
brief,
it
would
have
been
clearer
to
say
“
would
use
”
or
something
that
--
that
makes
absolutely
clear
that
you
required
foreknowledge.
i
think
if
the
court
has
questions
about
this
sort
of
case-specific
issue
along
with
the
forfeiture
and
waiver
and
harmless
error
and
plain
error
issues,
it
could
do
this,
and
this
would
be
a
sensible
result,
it
could
clarify,
one,
facilitation
with
respect
to
either
conduct
element
is
enough
as
far
as
actus
reus.
two,
the
intent
to
facilitate
means
an
intent
to
make
some
step
in
that
crime
easier
combined
with
knowledge
that
the
principal
bears
the
intent
to
complete
the
crime.
and
then
it
could
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
say,
sort
out
whether
this
instruction
was
wrong,
whether
that
objection
was
forfeited,
whether
harmless
error
or
plain
error
concepts
come
in
here.
mr.
john
f.
bash
the
--
justice
scalia,
the
instruction
--
or
part
of
the
same
instruction,
the
paragraph
immediately
before
just
mirrored--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--well,
to
help
make
the
crime
succeed.
and
i
think
a
reasonable
person
reading
that
would
not
think
i
helped
make
--
helped
make
the
924(c)
crime
succeed
if
i
didn't
even
know
about
the
gun
until
i
was
after
doing
--
i
was
done
doing
whatever
i
was
going
to
do.
and
i
also
point
the
court
to
page
194,
which
makes
clear
that
“
knowingly
”,
in
that
second
part
of
the
instruction,
is
defined
as
voluntarily
and
intentionally.
so
you
certainly
had
to
intentionally
participate
in
the
drug
trafficking
crime.
and
that
--
part
of
the
context,
as
this
court
has
said,
is
also
just--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--basically
a
slight
tweak,
which
is
knowing
that
the
principal
bore
the
intent
to
use
a
gun.
obviously,
you
can't
know
the
future.
it's
that
you
know
that
the
principal
bore
that
intent,
which
is
a
little
bit
different,
but
i
think
we're
saying
the
same
thing.
mr.
john
f.
bash
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
wouldn't
say
that.
this
umbrella
instruction
applied
to
count
1
and
2.
the
crime
you're
help
making
succeed
is
924(c).
what
i
was
saying
earlier
was
that,
what
does
it
mean
to
help
make
a
crime
succeed?
it
makes
--
it
means
intent
to
make
one
--
at
least
one
step
in
that
crime
easier,
knowing
the
other
person
bore
the
intent
to
do
the
crime.
and
i
think
that's
how
we
normally
think
about
it.
if
there's
an
armed
robbery,
and
you
say,
well,
i'll
drive
the
getaway
car,
i
think
you
would
naturally
say
in
ordinary
english
you
intended
to
help
make
that
crime
succeed
even
if
you
didn't
bear
a
specific
intent
with
respect
to
the
gun.
i
certainly
think
on
--
you
know,
if
this
had
been
objected
to
below,
it
might
be
a
different
matter
with
mr.
elwood,
but
he
did
not
object
to
this
below.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
raise
this
--
this
wording
issue
even
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
raised
a
sufficiency
challenge
with
respect
to
foreknowledge.
but
he
--
even
in
his
court
of
appeals
brief,
he
didn't
say
that
the
instructions
in
this
case
were
wrong
because
it
said
“
used
”
versus
“
would
use
”.
so
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
properly
here,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
sensible
resolution
if
the
court
were
to
remand
these
case-specific
issues
after
clarifying
the
basic
standard
of
aiding
and
abetting
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
work
through
the
forfeiture
and
waiver
of
harmless
error
and
so
forth.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
