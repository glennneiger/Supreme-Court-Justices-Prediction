what
cases
should
i
look
up
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
to
say,
i
thought
generally
in
the
criminal
law
a
person
who
commits
an
illegal
act
is
liable
for
the
known
consequences
of
that
act.
that
is
the
general
rule.
i
can't
think
--
i
mean,
people
use
all
kinds
of
terminology,
different
kinds
of
terminology,
but
i
thought
that's
the
basic
principle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
“
purposeful
intent
”,
he
didn't
want
it,
but
he
knew
it
would
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
moreover,
he
helped
to
produce
the
occasion
on
which
it
would
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
just
tell
me
where
in
the
brief
they
are,
or
whatever's
easier.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
use
the
word
“
intent
”.
some
people
used
it
in
order
to
encompass
the
situation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
known
but
undesired
consequence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
language.
i
am
sure
you
will
find
language.
i
want
really
an
instance
where
the
holding
of
the
case
is
that
a
person
who
commits
an
unlawful
action
with
knowledge
that
the
other
unlawful
action
will
occur
is
not
liable
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
blowing
up
the
carriage
and
you
kill
the
maid,
who
you
didn't
want
to
kill.
you
are
liable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
one
is
it?
