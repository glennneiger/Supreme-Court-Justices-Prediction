justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
the
jury
could
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
firearms
charge
under
a
proper
instruction?
in
other
words,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
so
that
if
a
proper
instruction
were
given,
there
could
have
been
a
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
we
can
get
into
later
to
whether
or
not
if
you
know
a
firearm
is
being
carried
and
if
you
then
facilitate
the
commission
of
the
underlying
felony
by
driving
the
car,
participating
in
the
transaction,
whether
that's
sufficient.
but
let
me
ask
you
this:
would
the
instruction
that
was
given,
which
was
at
ja
196,
would
it
be
okay
if
paragraph
1,
"the
defendant
knew
his
cohort
used
a
firearm.
"
i
think
there
is
a
real
problem
with
that,
because
it's
retrospective.
would
the
instruction
have
been
sufficient
if
the
defendant
knew
his
cohort
would
use
or
was
carrying?
would
that
change
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
scalia
can
--
his
own
question.
but
the
question
is:
what
--
what
does
the
jury
have
to
find?
i
know
they
can
--
i
know
what
they
can
infer,
but
the
question
from
justice
scalia
is,
you're
the
--
you
drive
--
you
drive
the
car,
you
know
firearms
are
there
and
might
be
used,
is
that
sufficient?
and
that's
his
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
--
that's
a
conclusion.
the
jury,
it
seems
to
me,
could
say
you
do
facilitate
it
if
in
these
hypotheticals
you
drive
the
car--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
knowledge
that
the
gun
might
be
used.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
submission
is
the
jury
can
find
otherwise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
--
the
gun
would
never
have
been
used
if
you
didn't
drive
the
--
or
carried
if
you
didn't
drive
the
car.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
didn't
--
you
said
the
only
evidence
was
that
it
was
inside
the
gun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
was
the
evidence?
i
thought
there
was
evidence
that
he
possessed
cartridges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
was
there
any
evidence
that
he
had
the
gun?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
was
the
evidence
that
he
had
the
gun
and
the
evidence
of
the
cartridges
are
exactly
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
we
have
cases
that
say
that
assisting
flight
immediately
after
the
crime
is
not
aiding
and
abetting
the
crime?
the
crime
is
over?
so
everybody
says
the
crime's
over.
let's
--
let's
walk
home.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i
think
it
would
help
if
you
told
us
what
the
definition
of
the
crime
is.
we'll
talk
about
the
jury
instructions
later.
justice
scalia
is
asking
whether
or
not
if
you
facilitate
the
drug
crime
knowing
that
a
weapon
is
being
carried,
if
that
is
sufficient
for
aiding
and
abetting
as
a
legal
matter?
forget
the
jury
instructions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
clear,
and
we'll
get
back
to
the
bank
robbery
hypothetical.
driving
the
car,
knowing
a
gun
is
being
carried
and
might
be
used,
is
or
is
not
sufficient
facilitation
to
make
you
an
aider
and
abetter
in
the
drug
--
in
the
gun
aspect
of
the
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
not
carrying.
your
--
your
cohort
is
carrying
the
gun.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
driving
the
car,
the
cohort
has
the
gun,
the
cohort
is
going
to
rob
the
bank.
are
you
or
are
you
not
aiding
and
abetting
because
you're
facilitating
it
by
driving
the
car,
yes
or
no?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
instruction
at
j196
says
that
the
defendant
"knew
his
cohort
used
a
firearm.
"
it
really
should
say
that
"knew
his
cohort
would
carry
a
firearm.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
as
i
--
when
i
read
this,
i
thought,
well,
given
these
confusing
facts,
a
jury
might
think
that
there's
liability
if
he
knew
that
a
firearm
was
used,
which
is
a
very
odd
interpretation,
but
that's
--
the
instruction
lends
itself
to
that
interpretation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
agree
that,
taken
by
itself,
that
one
could
be
read
that
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
said
taken
by
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
look
at
his
--
look
at
his
instruction
and
think
about
the
bank
robbery
hypothetical
with
the
driver
of
the
car.
his
number
2
is
that
they
intentionally
took
some
action
to
facilitate
or
encourage
the
use
of
the
firearm.
i
think
that
would
be
an
okay
instruction
in
the
bank
robbery
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
drove
the
car.
principal
object
was
to
rob
the
bank,
not
to
use
the
firearm,
but
he
facilitated
the
use
of
a
firearm.
i
can
see
that
a
judge
could
give
that
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
you
agree
that
for
aiding
and
abetting,
you
must
--
the
gun
offense,
you
must
have
knowledge
that
the
gun
is
being
carried
by
the
cohort.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
agree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
that
in
order
to
show
aiding
and
abetting
--
and
i'll
just
quote
from
a
california
case
here
--
that,
"the
aider
and
abetter
has
to
have
knowledge
of
the
criminal
purpose
of
the
perpetrator
and
the
intent
to
facilitate
it?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
--
would
you
agree
that
the
statement
--
that
the
first
part
of
the
instruction
that
the
district
court
gave,
"defendant
knew
his
cohort
used
a
firearm.
"
is
inaccurate?
is
incomplete?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
potentially
misleading?
