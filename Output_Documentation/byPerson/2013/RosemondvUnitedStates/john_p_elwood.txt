mr.
john
p.
elwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
has
long
been
a
bedrock
principle
of
american
law
that
aiding
and
abetting
liability
requires
proof
that
an
accomplice
acted
with
purposeful
intent
to
facilitate
or
encourage
the
crime
of
conviction
and
that
mere
knowing
assistance
is
insufficient.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
even
if
the
--
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
even
if
the
jury
had
been
given
a
proper
instruction,
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
charge
to
make
out
because
the
government
never
really
argued
facilitation
after
getting
knowledge
of
the
firearm.
there
was
never
evidence
of
foreknowledge;
the
government
never
asserted
evidence
of
foreknowledge.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
i
think
at
least
that
would
have
required
foreknowledge.
but
i
think
it
would
still
have
been
problematic
because
it
would
only
have
required
knowing
facilitation.
and
courts,
traditionally,
have
required
intentional
facilitation,
that
is,
they
intend
to
further
the
crime.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
it's
our
position
that
you
could
infer
from
the
fact
that
you're
assisting
the
transaction
involving--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--knowledge
is
not
itself
intent.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
--
i
think
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
support
a
verdict.
that
would
support
a
verdict.
the
only
question--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct.
but
the
question
is
whether
you
don't
even
have
to
instruct
a
jury--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--and
i
think
that
you
can
conclude
from
that
that
his
purpose
in
assuming
that
he's
driving--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--you
know,
i
hate
to
be
accused
of
resisting
the
hypothetical,
because
in
that
--
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
you
have
the
subjective
desire,
like
you
think,
boy,
i
sure
wish
those
firearms
weren't
involved.
but
because
at
that
point,
your
goal
is
to
facilitate
and
make
sure
that
this
bank
robbery--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--with
the
gun
succeeds.
the
whole
thing
with
the
gun.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but
that
is
your
--
we
would
say
that
that
is
the
purpose
in
facilitating.
and
the
question
is
not
just
that.
the
question
is
whether
you--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
don't
think
that
that
--
i
think
that
you
have
to
have
the
fore
--
the
foreknowledge.
and
i
think
that
there
are
certainly
hypothesize--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
you
--
the
question
is
whether
--
you
can't
even
conceive
of
the
circumstance
where
knowing
--
that
is,
participation
--
knowing
that
a
firearm
would
be
used
or
carried.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
for
example,
if
you
agree
to
drive
your
neighbor
to
pick
up
drugs
at
some
place
in
philadelphia
or
--
let's
make
it
pittsburgh.
and
then
you
drive
him
to
west
virginia
to
spend
the
weekend
dealing.
on
the
way
there
he
tells
you,
the
guy
who
distributed
these
to
me,
you
know,
he
always
carries
a
derringer
in
his
boot.
and
at
that
point,
you
don't
facilitate
his
use
or
carriage
of
the
gun
with
respect
to
the
drug
distribution
offense.
it
has
no
role
in
--
in
the
crime.
and
so
i
think
you
can
conceive
of
enough
circumstances--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--yes,
but
he's
still
facilitating
the
drug
distribution
offense
at
a
time
he
knows
that
a
gun
is,
you
know,
being
carried
in
relation
to
it.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
and
at
that
point,
it's
his
purpose
to
facilitate
a
transaction
and
to,
you
know,
help
it
succeed
and
it's
at
a
time
when
he
knows
that
a
gun
will
be
used
and
that
--
i
think
you
can
conclude
that
that
is
his
purpose.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
question
is--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--the
question
is
whether
there
are
--
because
there
are
just
no
instances
that
are
more
like
my
hypothetical
than
like
your
hypothetical.
so
you
don't
even
have
to
bother
troubling
the
jury
about
whether
they
had
the
intent.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
the
point
of
it
is
that
at
a
time
when
you
are
--
when
you
are
still
participating
in
the
underlying
offense,
the
drug
trafficking
offense,
you
know
that
a
gun
is
being
carried
in
relation
to
it.
but
you
don't
have
any
intent
to
facilitate
it.
you
don't
care
one
way
or
the
other
if
it
gets
used.
you
don't
intend
to
facilitate
it,
and
you
don't
facilitate
it.
and
the
question
is
whether
you--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
the
thing
is--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no,
but
the
gun
is
not
going
to
be
used
in
your
act
of
facilitation.
it
may
be
used
over
in
philadelphia,
and
you
aren't
doing--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--and
the
question--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
i
think
the
jury
could
equally
well
conclude
that
you
did
not
intend
to
facilitate
the
use
of
the
gun
and
you
did
not
facilitate
the
use
of
the
gun.
and
the
question
is
whether
you
even
need
to
trouble
the
jury
with
it.
because
the
government's
instruction
conclusively
presumes
both
knowledge
--
or
conclusively
presumes
intent
from
knowledge
alone
and
it
conclusively
presumes
facilitation
of
the
gun
from
facilitation
of
the
underlying
offense.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
in
your
case
with
the
foreknowledge
and
where
he,
you
know,
facilitates,
he
carries
the
gun
and
he
carries
the
person
to
the
offense,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
tough
slog.
in
a
case
--
but
ours
is
a
case
where
there
isn't
foreknowledge
and
the
government
never
argued
that
he
knew
before
the
gun
--
before
the
gun
was
fired
that
it
was
his
associate
who
was
the
shooter.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
it
would
be
error
because
you're
instructing
them
on
the
wrong
elements.
it
might
be
harmless
error.
but
the
point
--
both
sides
agree
here
that
you
have
to
facilitate
the
crime
of
conviction
and
you
have
to
intend
that
the
gun
be
used.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
--
you
know
what,
i'm
fine
with
it
being
a
harmful
error,
too.
but
my
point
was
merely
to
note
that
i
think
that
it
is
something
that
you
have
to
instruct
the
jury
on
as
a
proper
element--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--even
if
it
winds
up
not
making
a
difference.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
there
has
to
be
pre-knowledge.
my
point
is
this:
that
there
are
circumstances
i
think
where
you
can
know
of
a
gun
and
be
participating
in
the
underlying
--
underlying
predicate
offense
and
not
facilitate
the
use
of
the
gun.
and
i--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--for
example,
if
you
--
your
job,
you're
the
lowest
level
guy
in
a
drug
organization.
you
stand
on
a
street
corner
every
night
and
you
hand
out
drugs
to
anybody
who
comes
up.
you
don't
carry
a
gun.
nobody
has
ever
carried
a
gun
at
that
street
corner.
one
night
you're
doing
it
and
you
see
that
the
guy
is
--
that
the
guy
who
you
work
for,
his
enforcer
is
coming
by
and
you
know
he
always
carries
a
gun.
he
walks
behind
you
and,
you
know,
he's
present
and
around
you
for
about
90
seconds,
but
during
that
time,
you
do
exactly
what
you
always
did.
i
think
a
jury
could
conclude
--
and
i'm
not
saying
that
they
couldn't
conclude
otherwise,
but
they
could
conclude
that
he
didn't
facilitate
the
use
or
carriage
of
the
gun.
he
was
just--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
would
just--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
would
just
say
that
the
--
that
the
jury
has
to
find
that
the
defendant
facilitated
the
use
or
carriage
of
a
gun
during
and
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
drug
trafficking
offense--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--and
that
they
intended
to
do
so.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right.
but
that's
the
thing.
those
are
what
we
think
would
be
the
proper
instruction,
that
they
just
have
to
be
instructed
on
the
facilitation
and
on
the
intent.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
you
have
to
have
prior
knowledge
before
you
facilitate
it.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
exactly.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
you
don't
need
prior
knowledge
before
the
whole
transaction
happens.
if
you
continue
to
--
if
there's
an
act
of
facilitation
after
you
learn
of
it--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
exactly.
that's
all
i
mean
by
the
absence
of
prior
knowledge.
but
i
mean,
everyone
here
agrees
that
you
need
to
have
knowledgeable
or
facilitation.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
two
things,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
the
government
never
raised
this
below
and
it
wasn't
pressed
or
passed
on
below,
and
so
i
think
under
glover
v.
united
states
this
court
wouldn't
ordinarily
consider
that
in
the
first
instance,
would
leave
it
for
remand.
but
secondly,
i
think
that
it's
not
clear
enough.
i
mean,
you
can't
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
didn't
infect
that,
too,
because
the
jury
was
instructed
four
times
that
you
can
possess
something
through
constructive
possession,
through
a
confederate.
and
i
think
when
the
jury
concludes
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
possession
offense,
which
is
924(c)
as
a
possession
offense,
as
an
aider
and
abetter,
and
they
marked
on
the
judge's
instruction
that
he
used
the
gun,
he
carried
the
gun,
that
the
jury
could
have
believed
that
they
were
--
that
he
constructively
possessed
the
gun
and
thereby
constructively
possessed
the
ammunition.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
the
only
evidence
of
possession
was
that
it
was
inside
the
gun
that
was
fired.
and
i
think
the
jury
rejected
the
idea
that
he
was
the
shooter
because
the
two
eyewitnesss
said
that
the
shooter
was
someone
else,
that
the
shooter
was
the
guy
in
the
backseat,
who
was
ronald
joseph.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
ammunition
was
inside
the
gun.
and
the
only
evidence
of
his--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no.
the
only
evidence
was
that
the
evidence
was
inside
the
gun
--
or
i'm
sorry,
the
evidence
--
that
the
ammunition
was
inside
the
gun.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
evidence
that
he
had
the
gun
was
the
--
the
guy
who
was
the
other
shooter--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--they
are
exactly
the
same.
the
only
evidence
was
that
the
cartridges
were
inside
the
gun.
and
the
evidence
--
the
two
eyewitnesss
who
were
at
the
scene
said
that
the
person
got
out
of
the
driver's
side,
and
the
evidence
suggests
that
mr.
rosemond
was
on
the
passenger
side,
and
that
he
got
out
of
the
backseat,
and
he
was
in
the
front
seat.
so
the
--
the
evidence,
i
think,
is
that
he
was
--
he
was
merely
in
the
car,
not
that
he
was
a
shooter.
and
the
jury,
remember,
asked:
do
we
have
to
answer
question
3,
which
was
the
--
all
the
different
ways
you
can
use
the
gun
--
if
we
find
him
guilty
on
an
aiding
and
abetting
theory?
which
certainly
suggests
they
did
not
believe
he
was
the
shooter.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
government
did
not
ever
argue
facilitation
after
the
shots
were
fired,
i
suspect
because
--
they
only
argued
that
he
--
that
what
happened
afterwards
was
evidence
he
was
the
shooter.
i
suspect
because
they
appreciated
that
the
offense
was
over
with.
he
was
only
charged
with
possession
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute.
when
mr.
gonzales
took
off
with
the
marijuana
and
they
lost
control,
you
know,
they
went
around
afterwards
looking
for
him,
which,
you
know,
there's
not
even
very
much
evidence
of
that.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
--
i
am
not
aware
and
the
government
hasn't
cited
any.
i
mean,
there's
--
there's
--
for
different
crimes,
you
know,
there's
--
there's
different
law
about
whether
flight
is
part
of
the
offense.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
is
whether
that
would
be
aiding
and
abetting
that
crime,
the
possession
offense
or
some
distinct
crime,
or
whether
that
would
be
being
an
accessory
after
the
fact.
and
that
was
never
charged.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
there
was
no
evidence
that
that
intent
to
chase
them
was
ever
communicated
to
mr.
rosemond.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
itself
was
disputed.
but
the
question
is,
even
if
they're
chasing
him,
that
might
be
attempt
to
possess
the
marijuana
to
get
it
back.
it
might
be
conspiracy
to
possess
the
marijuana,
but
that
wasn't
--
wasn't
charged.
the
only
thing
was
possession.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
agree.
but
first,
that's
not
a
theory
that
the
government
ever
espoused.
they
never
argued
that
facilitation.
and
secondly,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
facilitation
of
possession
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute
it.
that
ended
under
the
court's
instructions
when
they
lost
control
of
the
marijuana
when
mr.
gonzales
disappeared.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
yes.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
we're
not
saying
that.
we
are
saying
that
when
you
--
you
have
to
instruct
them
did
he
facilitate
the
actual
crime
of
conviction.
because
what
the
government
is
doing
here,
what
their
instruction
does
is
it
conclusively
presumes
that
he
facilitated
the
distinct
offense,
which
this
court
has
said,
the
entirely
new
crime
of
924(c),
from
the
fact
that
they
did
the
underlying
offense.
their
favorite
example
in
the
brief
is
a
mail
fraud
example.
but
under
the
government's
theory,
because
you
engage
in
an
act
of
mail
fraud,
you
could
be
convicted
of
racketeering
without
any
additional
actus
reus
because
that
is
a
predicate
crime
to
rico.
and
that's
the
thing
is
we're
just
saying
you
can't
presume
the
full
offense
--
facilitation
of
the
full
offense
from
the
fact
that
you
just
facilitated
one
element.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
we're
just
saying
that
they
have
to
be
--
the
jury
just
has
to
be
instructed
to
ask,
did
he
facilitate
the
crime
of
conviction?
and
they're
asking
a
different
--
they're
asking
a
different
question,
essentially.
and
it
wouldn't
present
the
same
risk
that
you
would
convict
someone
twice
and
they'd
serve
two
consecutive
sentences
under
the
hypothetical
you
suggest,
but
we
still
say
they
should
be
asked
whether
they
facilitated
the
right
crime.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
it
was
924(c),
a
crime
with
the
long
name.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
and
our
submission
is
just
that
the
jury
still
has
to
be
asked,
did
he
facilitate
the
crime.
this
is
--
both
sides
agree
that
you
have
to
ask
--
that
one
of
the
elements
is
whether
they
facilitated
the
crime.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no.
we
think
they're
asking
both
the
wrong
questions
then.
but
--
is
there--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no.
his
--
our
only
position
is
that
they
have
to
ask
the
jury,
did
he
facilitate
the
924(c)
offense.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
and
it's
our
submission
that
you
have
to
both
facilitate
the
924(c)
offense
and
that
you
have
to
have
the
intent
that
the
gun
be
used
or
carried
during
and
in
relation
to
the
crime.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that's
right.
but
it's
--
i
think
our
--
the
reason
why
we
think
it
makes
a
difference
is
because
it's
a
different
crime.
and
the
government
is
trying
to
get
the
jury
to
conclusively
presume
from
the
fact
that
you
did
the
one
crime,
that
you
must
also
have
facilitated
the
other.
and
we
just
don't
think
that
that
is
something
that
you
can
say
with
100
percent
certainty
so
you
can
remove
it
from
jury
determination.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
there
are
some
courts
that
apply
this,
our
rationale
to
lesser
included's
as
well.
but
lesser
included
crimes
are
the
same
crime
for
blockburger
purposes.
you
can't
be
sentenced
to
both
the
greater
and
the
lesser.
and
i
think
most
courts
require
that
you
show
the
intent
that
the
gun
be
used.
they
don't
as
often
require
that
you
facilitate
the
discreet
use
of
or
carriage
of
a
gun.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
well,
he
may
say
that
he
is
not
going
to
facilitate
it,
but,
depending
on
what
his
actions
are,
he
may
--
very
well
may
facilitate
it.
if
he
drives
the
gun
and
the
person
to
the
--
the
crime,
you
know,
that
is
an
act
of
facilitation.
and
so,
you
know,
it
doesn't
depend
on
what
the
person
says.
it
depends
on
what
the
person
does.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
that
would
be
enough,
because
you
are
carrying
the
gun
as
well
as
the
person.
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--oh.
yes,
you're
carrying
--
you're
--
by
carrying
--
the
gun
is
in
your
car.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
we
would
say
that,
yes,
that
is
certainly
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
that
--
i
think
that
that
would
be
enough
to
show
that,
because
you're
carrying
both
the
gun
on
your
cohort
and
you're
carrying
the
cohort,
that
that
would
be
enough
to
facilitate
that.
i
would
like--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct.
you
would
still
have--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct.
intent
and
facilitation.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
a
point
made
by
justice
kagan,
which
is
that
traditionally
because
the
actus
reus
is
relatively
small
for
aiding
and
abetting
cases,
that
is
exactly
why
courts
have
adopted
a
standard
of
purposeful
intent.
and
they
have
said
that
because
the
act
of
an
accomplice
tends
to
be
less
harmful
and
tends
to
be
more
equivocal
than
that
of
the
principal,
that
they
ordinarily
require
purposeful
intent.
and
as
professor
wayne
lafave
said,
who
obviously
doesn't
have
a
stake
in
the
case:
"liability
has
seldom
been
imposed
on
the
basis
of
knowing
assistance.
"
"the
background
rule
is
that
it
has
to
be
purposeful
intent.
"
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--the
standard
for
accomplice
liability
requires
purposeful
intent.
it's
generally--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
was
his
purpose--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
was
his
purpose
for
doing
it.
and
the
cases
you
can
look
at
are
nye
&
nissen--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
mean,
nye
&
nissen,
the
--
nye
&
nissen,
which
is
a
case
of
this
court
from
1949,
where
the
court
adopted
the
standard
from
the
learned
hand
peoni,
that
adopted
the
purposeful
intent
standard.
and
peoni
is
obviously
a
very
important
case
as
well.
but
hicks.
in
hicks,
in
1893
this
court
reversed
a
conviction
because
the
jury
instruction
did
not
require
proof
of
intent
to
encourage
the
crime.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right.
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
action
for
any
other
purpose,
even
if
with
the
--
even
if
it
had
the
effect
of
encouraging--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
would--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
would
point
you--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i'm
sorry
to
lafave
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
a
case
off
the
top
of
my
head.
i
know
that
they
state
the
principal.
but
lafave
in
chapter
13.2
collects
cases
and
he
makes
the
point
there
that
liability
has
seldom
been
imposed
on
the
basis
of
knowing
assistance
for
aiders
and
abetters.
you
have
to
have
purposeful
intent--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--lafave,
wayne
lafave.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
you
know,
on
rule
30,
i
won't
pretend
that
it
was
a
model
of
clarity
in
preserving
the
error
about
after-arising
intent.
but
i
will
say
that
there
is
no
contrast.
i
mean,
that
is
to
us
just
a
sign
of
how
messed
up
the
jury
instructions
are.
but
we
did
preserve,
we
say,
our
objection
both
with
respect
to
the
absence
of
facilitating
the
right
offense,
and
the
intent
to
commit
the
crime
as
opposed
to
knowledge
that
the
gun
would
be
used.
and
so--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--with
respect
to
intent,
by
objecting
to
their
instruction
on
the
basis
that
it
didn't
include
intentional
facilitation
of
the
924(c)
offense.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
will
rely
on
our
submission.
