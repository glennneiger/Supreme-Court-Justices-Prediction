mr.
elwood,
you're
dealing
with
all
kinds
of
hypotheticals.
but
in
this
case
we
had
a
jury
determination
that
rosemond
was
the
person
--
he
was
convicted
of
carrying
ammunition,
right?
there
were
two
counts
of
carrying
--
possession
of
the
ammunition.
and
couldn't
one
infer
from
that
that
he
--
he
possessed
the
ammunition,
he
was
the
gun
carrier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
evidence
that
the
jury
had
on
whether
he
possessed
the
ammunition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
--
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
additional
120
months?
the
underlying
crime
is
48
months
and
then
the
--
the
gun
makes
it
120
months
more
consecutive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
we
just
take
it
that
we
have
a
crime,
the
underlying
crime,
it's
a
48-month
crime,
and
then
if
you
have
a
gun
in
connection
with
that
crime,
it
becomes
120
months
consecutive.
and
your
position
seems
to
be
that
all
you
have
to
prove
is
facilitation
of
the
underlying
drug
offense.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
--
to
get
10
years
of
your
life
for
the
government
proving
no
more
than
the
48-month
charge
is
a
bit
much.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bash,
would
you
explain
why
in
this
situation
the
guy
abetted
a
drug
deal
when
there
was
no
drug
deal?
it
had
been
thwarted.
the
drugs
were
stolen.
they
were
not
engaged
in
any
attempt
to
sell
the
drugs.
that
was
a
failed
attempt.
so
how
is
this
done,
abetting
a
drug
deal,
when
the
deal
failed?
