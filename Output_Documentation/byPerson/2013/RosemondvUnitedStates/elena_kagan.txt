isn't
criminal
law
--
isn't
criminal
law
replete
with
crimes
which
have
lesser
included
offenses
as
part
of
them?
so
wouldn't
your
rule
be
a
very
difficult
one
to
apply
because
it
would
suggest
that
the
person
had
to
facilitate
some
part
of
the
crime
that
was
not
a
part
of
a
lesser
included
offense?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
bash,
what
about
this
case?
suppose
that
there
are
two
guys
and
they
are
talking
about
committing
a
crime,
and
they
have
the
same
kind
of
conversation
that
justice
alito
was
referencing,
you
know,
one
guy
says
i
want
to
bring
a
gun,
the
other
says,
no,
i
think
that's
a
really
bad
idea.
but
this
time,
the
guy
says:
okay,
you've
convinced
me,
it's
a
bad
idea
to
bring
a
gun,
i
won't
bring
a
gun.
and
so
then
they
go
out
and
they
rob
whatever
they
are
robbing,
and
in
the
middle
of
it,
you
know
--
or
they
do
a
drug
transaction,
and
in
the
middle
of
that
drug
transaction
the
guy
who
said
don't
bring
a
gun
looks
over
and
he
realizes
that,
notwithstanding
the
promise,
his
confederate
did
bring
a
gun.
but
there
they
are,
they
are
in
the
middle
of
their
drug
transaction.
so
the
guy,
you
know,
they're
right
--
they
are
handing
the
money
to
each
other
and
the
guy
keeps
on
doing
it,
all
right?
is
--
is
that
enough,
even
though,
you
know,
there's
foreknowledge,
there's
acts
after
he
--
he
realizes
that
the
guy
has
a
gun?
is
that
sufficient?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
exactly
would
you
want
him
to
do
at
that
point
to
not
be
convicted
of
this,
of
this
offense?
would
you
want
him
to
just
say,
you
know,
sort
of
like
drop
everything,
i'm
out
of
there?
is
that
the
idea?
justice
elena
kagan
right.
i
mean,
i
guess
that's
the
question:
is
there
always
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
withdraw
after
you
see
that
there's
a
gun
in
the
offense
that
you
didn't
expect
to
be
there?
and
do
you
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
withdraw,
or
would
you
say,
no,
everybody
has
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
withdraw
all
the
time;
you
can
just
leave?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bash,
you
know,
what
sticks
in
my
craw
a
little
bit
about
your
position
is
this:
usually,
we
want
punishments
to
--
two
people
and
they
do
very
different
things
and
they
have
very
different
intents,
we
want
them
actually
to
be
punished
differently.
and
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
there
is
--
let's
say
a
crime,
two
people
are
involved
in
it.
one
person
does
almost
everything.
you
know,
he
does
90
percent
of
the
stuff.
and
the
other
person
does
just
a
little
thing,
but
something,
you
know,
that
goes
to
the
offense
that
helps
facilitate
the
offense.
but
it's
really
pretty
small
compared
to
the
overall
crime.
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
that
person
does
not
have
really
full-fledged
intent,
just
has
a
kind
of
knowledge
that
this
other
person
with
real
purpose
of
intent
is
going
to
bring
a
gun.
so
--
so,
you
have
a
lesser
act
and
a
lesser
intent,
and
notwithstanding
that,
you're
saying
that
the
person
ought
to
be
punished
in
the
exact
same
way
as
his
confederate.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
just
add,
what
i
would
have
thought
was
that
the
actus
reus
can
be
very
small,
but
almost
to
compensate
for
that,
you
have
to
have
full-fledged
intent.
you
have
to
have
a
really
kind
of
purpose
of
--
a
--
a
purpose
that
the
crime
succeed
as
opposed
to
just
knowledge
of
--
of
what
will
happen.
