justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
but
what
are
we
instructing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
think
what
we're
driving
at
here,
and
i
think
this
is
the
moment
you're
resisting,
but
to
me,
and
as
you
can
tell
from
my
colleague's
questions,
if
you
know
that
someone's
carrying
a
gun,
and
whether
you
want
them
to
use
it
or
not
is
irrelevant,
if
they
take
it
out
and
use
it
and
you
have
gone
along
with
them
in
the
crime,
you're
guilty.
okay?
that
--
that's
what
we're
driving
at.
assume
that
i
believe
that.
assume
that
i
believe
that
if
you
have
knowledge
of
the
gun,
and
that
i
am
participating
in
the
crime
with
your
knowledge
of
that
gun,
whether
the
knowledge
is
secured
before
the
crime
starts
or
during
the
crime,
if
i
continue
to
participate
in
the
crime
knowing
that
you
have
a
gun,
then
that's
knowledge
of
the
gun
and
intent
to
facilitate.
i
thought
the
example
that
you
were
relying
on
here
or
the
issue
that
got
confused
in
the
briefs
was
whether
or
not,
from
the
sequence
of
facts
in
this
case,
you
can
actually
discern
that
intent
to
facilitate
the
crime
because
the
alleged
shooter,
which
your
client
said
was
someone
else,
jumped
into
the
car
and
the
car
took
off
before
anybody
could
abandon
the
crime.
that's
what
i
actually
thought
this
case
was
about:
at
what
juncture
do
you
instruct
the
jury
to
say
that
you
have
to
be
a
participant
with
knowledge
of
the
crime?
but
you're
saying
something
different
right
now.
you're
almost
suggesting
that
there
has
to
be
a
pre-knowledge
that
the
gun
will
be
used.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
hard
to
imagine
that.
give
me
an
example.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
the
instruction
look
like?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
to
--
to
--
what
would
it
look
like
to
capture
the
difference
you're
trying
to
convey?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
then
you
come--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
come
up
against
the
government's
argument
that
you
don't
have
to
facilitate
every
element.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
talk
practically
about
what
the
difficulties
are
for
the
government
in
this
scenario?
it's
nice
to
put
hypotheticals
in
where
you
know,
where
you
say
someone
knew
x,
y
and
z.
the
reality
is
in
most
cases
you
don't.
occasionally
you
get
a
co-conspirator
that
will
tell
you,
but
in
most
cases
you
have
just
the
actor.
a
defendant
is
present
during
a
crime,
a
gun
is
pulled,
and
he
leaves
with
his
cohorts.
you
don't
know
if
he
had
advance
knowledge
that
the
gun
would
be
used
because
he
wasn't
carrying
it
and
he
may
have
done
nothing
but
be
present
during
the
crime,
left,
and
got
a
split
of
the
money
later,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
your
point,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
your--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
isn't
this
really
an
argument
about
how
you
define
facilitation?
you
are
not
arguing
that
--
that
some
form
of
participation
in
the
crime
with
knowledge
that
the
gun
is
being
used
is
required.
you
are
really
arguing
about
how
far
the
proof
has
to
go.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
your
adversary
keeps
saying
mere
knowledge
of
the
gun's
being
used
is
not
enough.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
so
hard
about
saying,
did
you
have
knowledge
that
the
gun
would
be
used,
either
--
and
you
facilitate
--
but
you
continue
to
facilitate
the
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
underlying
crime.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
knowing
that
a
gun
would
be
used.
you
had
to
intentionally
participate
knowing
that
a
gun
would
be
used.
