mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
daimler,
a
foreign
corporation,
is
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california
and
thus
may
be
sued
in
california
on
any
claim
arising
anywhere
in
the
world.
the
ninth
circuit
reached
this
conclusion
by
attributing
to
daimler
the
california
contacts
of
a
daimler
subsidiary,
mercedes
benz
usa,
a
separate
corporation
that
respects
all
corporate
formalities
and
that
is
not
daimler's
alter
ego.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
violates
due
process.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
california
respects
the
corporate
forum.
the
ninth
circuit
applied
what
appears
to
be
a
federal
common
law
of
agency
that
the
ninth
circuit
admittedly
developed
solely
for
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
inquiry.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
it
is,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
california
statute
extends
to
the
limit
of
due
process.
and
so
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
it
construed
what
the
permissible
outer
bounds
of
the
due
process
clause
was
in
this
context.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
may
be
a
constitutional
limit;
certainly
to
the
extent
that,
say,
california
adopted
a
rule
that
said
for
purposes
of
some
sort
of
liability,
we
are
going
to
disregard
the
corporate
forum,
i
think
that
could
pose
due
process
concerns
to
the
extent
that
it
is
purporting
to
override,
say,
the
corporate
law
of
delaware.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
i
--
i
still
think
there
would
be,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
other
words,
i
take
your
honor's
point
about
fair
notice,
if
california
said
going
forward
this
is
the
rule
we're
going
to
apply.
but
at
the
same
time,
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
in
the
constitution
would
empower,
say,
california
to
essentially
override,
say,
delaware's
corporate
law
and
say
for
our
state
purposes,
we're
essentially
going
to
rewrite
the
corporate
dna
of
a
corporation
that's
chartered
in
delaware
in
order
to--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well,
justice
sotomayor,
typically
this
court
has
applied
a
less
rigorous
due
process
standard
in
the
tax
cases
than
it
has
in
the
personal
jurisdiction
cases.
if
one
were
to
look
at,
say,
goodyear
or
mcintyre,
of
any
of
this
court's
more
recent
jurisdictional
decisions,
it
typically
takes
a
much
more
rigorous
view
of
the
due
process
clause's
limits
on
a
sovereign's
ability
to
adjudicate
matters
that
arise
outside
the
forum
than
it
has
in
the
tax
context.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
respectfully
disagree
that
we
conceded
the
point
below.
i'm
not
sure,
frankly,
that
we
could
concede
something
like
that
on
behalf
of
a
different
corporation
that's
not
a
party
to
this
lawsuit.
but
it
is
true
that
we
focused
on
the
attribution
question
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i
don't
think
that
that
point
affects
the
outcome
in
this
case,
because--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--yes,
it
would.
that
would
be
one
way
to
resolve
the
case.
another
way
to
resolve
the
case--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
again,
we
did
not
argue
that
point.
instead,
we
focussed
on
the
attribution
issue,
but
at
the
same
time--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor,
at
the
same
time,
i
do
think
that
that
notion,
that
mbusa
was
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california,
was
necessarily
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding.
so
i
do
think
it
is
properly
preserved
for
this
court's
review
if
the
court
elected
to
resolve
this
case
on
that
ground.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
justice
kagan,
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
justice
kagan,
that
certainly
would
be
an
acceptable
route
for
this
court
to
resolve
the
case.
and
your
honor
has
it
exactly
right,
in
that
even
if
one
were
to
attribute
the
constitutional
contacts
of
mbusa
to
daimler,
you
would
still
be
left
with
a
joint
enterprise
that
plainly
is
not
at
home
in
the
state
of
california.
it
would
still
be
a
german
corporation
headquartered
in
stuttgart
that
draws
only
approximately
2
percent
of
its
overall
vehicle
revenue
from
california
sales.
so
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
by
and
large,
justice
scalia,
most
other
countries
respect
the
corporate
forum
and
that
includes
parent/subsidiary
relations.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
anyone
who
disrespects
it;
and,
in
fact,
our
amici
talk
at
length
about
how
california's
exercise
of
general
jurisdiction
in
this
case
would
not
be
appropriate
in
virtually
any
other
nation.
i'm
frankly
not
sure
where
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here
would
be
viewed
as
tolerable.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well,
i
think
the
way
this
court
should
deal
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
is
simply
to
reverse
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
the
chain
of
reasoning,
your
honor,
is
simply
that
california,
like
all
states,
generally
respects
the
corporate
form,
certainly
with
regard
to
liability
determinations.
in
fact,
this
is
a
point
that
professor
brilmayer
makes
at
length
in
her
amicus
brief,
where
she
says
that
it
is
anomalous
for
a
state
on
one
hand
to
respect
the
corporate
form
as
to
liability
determinations,
but
then
when
it
comes
to
making
these
sorts
of
personal
jurisdictional
determinations,
it
applies
a
completely
different
standard.
so
i
think--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--if
it
were
the
case
your
honor
hypothesized,
i
think
there
may
well
be
specific
jurisdiction
available,
depending
on
whether
daimler
purposefully
availed
itself
of
the
california
forum.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
right.
what
this
court
has
said
in
its
opinions
in
asahi
and
then,
of
course,
in
mcentyre
is
that
you
look
whether
the
corporation
targeted
the
forum.
and
in
asahi,
justice
o'connor's
opinion
identified
several
facts
that
could
support
such
a
finding.
for
example,
whether
the
parent
targeted
advertising
at
the
forum,
whether
the
parent
designed
a
product
specifically
for
use
in
that
forum.
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
questions
of
specific
jurisdiction
are
highly
fact
dependent.
and
so
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
i
think
what
the
plaintiffs
would
do
to
establish
specific
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
parent
would
be
precisely
to
attempt
to
amass
evidence
showing
that
daimler
targeted
the
forum
where
they
intend
to
bring
the
suit.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well,
certainly
courts
have
exercised
specific
jurisdiction
in
that
situation.
but,
of
course,
as
this
court's
ruling
in
mcentyre
illustrates,
that's
not
necessarily
always
the
case
and
there
may,
of
course,
be
situations
where
a
product
does
cause
injury
in
the
forum,
yet
the
foreign
parent
is
not
necessarily
subject
to
specific
jurisdiction
in
that
forum.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
i
think
i
would
go
back
to
what
this
court
has
articulated,
first
of
all,
is
the
standard
for
specific
jurisdiction,
which
is
purposeful
availment
or
purposeful
direction.
i
think
as
far
as
what
constellation
of
facts--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
mercedes--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
in
some
cases
a
subsidiary's
work
could
give
rise
to
specific
jurisdiction,
but
i
think
that's
not
necessarily
true
across
the
united
states
in
all
cases.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
the
answer
i
would
give
is
that
in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
the
foreign
parent
could
be
subject
to
specific
jurisdiction
if
it
purposefully
availed
itself
of
the
forum
and
that
very
well
could
be
an
inquiry
that
turns
on
the
subsidiary's
activity.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
i
don't
think
it
did,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
because
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
suggests
that
by
creating
a
subsidiary
that
does
business
generally,
it
was
purposefully
targeting
california.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
justice
alito,
i
think
the
best
test
would
be
to
look
to
state
law
for
guidance,
precisely
because
that
is
the
law
that
commercial
actors
throughout
our
country
typically
would
look
to,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
might
be
in
a
veil-piercing
situation.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
certainly
this
court
in
other
due
process
contexts
has
looked
to
the
substance
of
state
law
to
inform
its
judgements,
for
example
in
determining
the
scope
of
protected
property
interests.
in
punitive
damages
cases,
it's
looked
to
state
law
to
determine
the
constitutional
boundaries.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
well--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--the
test
this
court
created
in
international
shoe,
i
think,
is
probably
best
characterized
as
a
federal
common
law
test.
i
think
that
this
situation
is
not
quite
analogous,
precisely
for
the
reason
i
mentioned
in
my
answer
to
justice
alito,
is
that
commercial
actors
and
lawyers
and
parties
throughout
the
country
typically
look
to
state
law
for
guidance.
and
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
general
federal
common
law
standard,
under
which
i
think
we
would
still
prevail,
but--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
i
think
some
of
the
amici,
candidly,
may
overstate
the
purported
confusion.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
veil-piercing
law
is
certainly
well
settled
and
vetted
in
this
country's
legal
traditions,
and
i
think
it
is
sufficiently
capable
of
precise
application
in
advance.
corporations
deal
with
that
standard
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
and
so
although
i
take
your
honor's
point
that
at
the
margins
there
may
be
room
for
debate
as
to
whether
a
veil
should
be
pierced
in
a
particular
case,
i
think
by
and
large
it's
a
general
standard,
it's
a
familiar
standard,
and
it's
a
workable
standard
and
it's
a
standard
that
people
look
to
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
i
believe
it's--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
we'll
provide
the
cite
to
your
honor.
if
they--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--i
will--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--right.
i
will--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--right.
i
will
provide
the
cite
to
your
honor
on
rebuttal.
it
is
the
california
civil
code.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
it
is
in
the
briefing.
we
did
not
reproduce
it
as
a
separate
addendum
at
the
beginning,
but
i
believe
it
is
quoted
in
the
briefing
and
i
will
provide
your
honor
with
a
precise
page
cite
on
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
it
simply
says
that
california
may
exercise
long
arm
jurisdiction
consistent
and
to
the
limit
permitted
by
federal
due
process.
that's
all
the
statute
says,
justice
scalia.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
just
a
few
brief
points.
first,
with
regard
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
remand,
i
think
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
for
this
court
to
remand
this
case
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issues
as
to
attribution
were
fully
briefed
below.
they
are
fully
briefed
here.
i
think
that
were
this
court
to
either
remand
the
case
or
dismiss
the
case,
for
one
thing,
the
circuit
split
would
persist.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
the
event
of
a
remand
would
remain
on
the
books.
even
if
this
court
were
to
remand
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
thomas
h.
dupree
jr.
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
we
do.
i
think
we
do.
and
let
me
say
this.
i
think
that
with,
regard
to
your
honor's
points
about
issues
being
waived
or
forfeited
below,
the
only
issue
that
even
arguably,
even
arguably
was
operated
below
was
the
discrete
question
as
to
whether
mercedes
benz
itself
is
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california.
the
question
that
justice
kagan
and
others
were
inquiring
about,
namely
that
even
were
one
to
accept
the
attribution
theory
and
evaluate
daimler
as
a
joint
enterprise,
would
that
render
the
combined
enterprise
at
home
in
california,
we
plainly
did
not
waive
or
forfeit
that
question.
in
fact
we
expressly
addressed
it
in
our
opening
brief
and
we
have
been
fighting
in
this
case
from
day
one
to
argue
that,
even
if
you
were
to
attribute
the
contacts,
there
is
no
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
daimler.
that
question
is
squarely
presented
for
this
court's
review.
i
also
think
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
and
others
have
noted,
there
has
been
some
confusion
in
the
lower
courts
over
the
distinction
between
specific
jurisdiction
and
general
jurisdiction.
this
court
saw
it
in
goodyear,
for
example,
and
i
think
that
were
this
court
to
resolve
this
case
on
the
ground
that
justice
kagan
suggested
or
justice
alito
suggested,
namely,
that
a
corporation
cannot
be
at
home
outside
of
the
areas
where
it
maintains
its
principal
place
of
business
or
is
incorporated,
that
it
can't
be
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
anywhere
else.
that
would
be
a
clean
rule.
it
would
be
a
workable
rule.
i
think
it's
fully
consistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
goodyear,
and
it
would
provide
clarity
and
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
and
eliminate
the
circuit
split
that
currently
exists
over
agency
jurisdiction.
a
couple
other
quick
points.
justice
scalia,
i
regret
to
report
that
neither
the
parties
nor
the
courts
below
reproduced
the
text
of
the
california
statute.
the
solicitor
general,
however,
to
his
credit
did
on
page
4
of
his
brief.
it
simply
says
that
california
may
exercise
jurisdiction
on
any
basis
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
of
california
or
the
united
states.
and
the
ninth
circuit
panel
on
page
19a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
said
that,
therefore,
the
question
is
this
case
--
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
would
exceed
the
permissible
bounds
of
due
process.
the
last
point
i
want
to
make,
and
we've
been
discussing
legal
issues,
is
just
to
remind
the
court
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
is
a
case
involving
argentine
plaintiffs
suing
a
german
corporation
based
on
events
that
allegedly
occurred
in
argentina
more
than
30
years
ago.
this
case
has
no
connection
to
the
united
states,
and
it
has
no
business
in
a
california
courtroom.
the
ninth
circuit's
contrary
conclusion
is
indefensible,
and
for
that
reason,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
be
reversed.
