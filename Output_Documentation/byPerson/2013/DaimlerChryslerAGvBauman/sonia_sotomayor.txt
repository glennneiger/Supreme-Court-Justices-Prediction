justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
permitted
that
in
container
corp.
we
permitted
california
law
to
tax
the
parent
california
corporation
for
the
earnings
of
all
its
foreign
subsidiaries.
and
we
said
the
due
process
clause
wasn't
offended
by
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
a
reasonable--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--where
else
have
we
done
it
in
the
personal
jurisdiction
context,
define
the
limits
of
the
due
process,
federal
due
process
in
accordance
with
state
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
didn't
we
create
tests
in
international
shoe,
in
burger
king
separate
from
state
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
we
do
with
all
the
amici
briefs
that
points
to
countless
articles
that
talk
about
the
corporate
veil-piercing
as
the
most
arbitrary
of
state
laws
out
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
how
--
how
corporations
get
any
sense
of
comfort
from
a
law
that's
so
irrationally
applied,
according
to
some.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
why
we
just
don't
rely
on
the
tests
we
apply
in
the
tax
cases?
it's
a
federal
test
and
it
says
if
you're
functionally
and
economically
tied
together
and
you
control
the
other
entity,
the
parent
controls
the
subsidiary,
your
earnings
are
subject
to
the
due
process
clause
and
can
be
taxed
by
an
individual
state.
it
seems
like
a
fairly
simple
test.
and
if
you
break
down
the
complicated
california
test,
really,
that
was
the
essence
it
was
getting
to.
so
why
do
we
go
to
the
vagrancies
of
state
law
and
why
don't
we
just
do
the
true
and
tried?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
california--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
mean,
in
most
agency
relationships,
titles
stay
with
the
principal.
so
i
don't
know
--
or
--
or
when
it
doesn't,
it
transfers
to
the
agent,
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
principal.
so
i
don't
know
what
the
sale
in
germany
has
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
an
odd
thing
to
say
given
the
page
and
a
half
that
the
lower
court
went
through
on
the
various
ways
in
which
germany
controls
this
subsidiary.
it
appoints
all
its
officers.
it
approves
all
its
operating
procedures.
it
approves
all
of
the
people
it
hires
and
fires.
it
seems
like
there
isn't
much
left
for
what--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
really
care
how
we
do
it?
given
that
so
many
issues
have
not
been
adequately
briefed,
conceded
when
they
are
obviously
fallacious
and
unsupportable,
why
don't
we
just
say
simply
exercise
of
jurisdiction
is
unreasonable
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
other
side
--
neither
you
or
the
other
side
have
argued
that
there
isn't
a
reasonableness
component.
i
know
some
of
my
colleagues
don't
think
there
is.
but
both
of
you
have
proceeded
in
your
briefing
as
if
there
is.
do
you
care
how
you
win?
