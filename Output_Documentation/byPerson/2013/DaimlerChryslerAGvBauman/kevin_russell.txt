mr.
kevin
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
of
what's
in
this
case
and
what
isn't,
because
the
fact
pattern
in
this
case
gives
rise
to
multiple
complicated
questions,
only
two
of
which
have
been
adequately
preserved
in
this
case.
and
one
of
the
questions
that's
not
in
the
case,
justice
kagan,
is
whether
or
not,
if
mbusa's
contacts
are
attributable,
they
are
sufficient
to
establish
general
jurisdiction.
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
on
the
personal
jurisdiction
issue
for
eight
years.
throughout
that
period,
we
have
argued
that
if
mbusa's
contacts
were
attributed
to
daimler,
they
were
sufficient
in
kind
and
quantity
to
support
general
jurisdiction
over
daimler
itself.
mr.
kevin
russell
that's
right.
and
if
you
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
wrong,
it's
because
of
the
argument
that
daimler
did
not
preserve.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
that
might
be
a
reason
then
for
this
court
to
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted.
a
cert
petition,
a
grant
of
cert
shouldn't
be
a
get-out-of-jail-free
card.
mr.
kevin
russell
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
russell
that's
because
petitioners
didn't
raise
that
question
en
banc.
they
filed
an
en
banc
petition
after
goodyear
came
down--
mr.
kevin
russell
--and
they
did
not
raise
these
questions.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
with
respect,
justice
kagan,
it's
not
as
easy
as
you
seem
to
think
it
is.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
in
perkins,
this
court
cited
a
prior
case
as
a
quintessential
paradigmatic
example
of
general
jurisdiction,
called
barrow
steamship
company
v.
kane,
and
in
that
case,
it
approved
--
this
court
approved
the
exercise
of
general
jurisdiction
in
new
york
over
a
british
steamship
company
for
a
tort
that
occurred
in
ireland
based
on
the
fact
that
it
had
an
office
run,
actually,
by
another
company,
a
mercantile
company
called
henderson.
mr.
kevin
russell
that
was
1898.
but
this
court--
mr.
kevin
russell
--but
my
point
is
that
this
court
in
perkins,
which
is
quite
a
long
time
after
international
shoe,
cited
to
barrows
as
an
example
of
a
paradigmatic
example.
mr.
kevin
russell
justice
ginsburg,
just
to
be
clear,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
case
is
like
perkins.
i'm
saying
that
in
perkins,
a
post-international
shoe
case,
this
court
embraced
the
result
in
barrows,
which
is
a
case
quite
like
this
one.
and
more--
mr.
kevin
russell
--because
petitioner,
again,
didn't
make
that
argument,
either.
mr.
kevin
russell
this
case
has
been
litigated
on
the
interpretation
of
the
california
statute
that
says
that
california
intended,
notwithstanding
what
rules
it
applies
for
liability,
to
exercise
personal
jurisdiction
to
the
furthest
extent
permitted
by
the
constitution.
and
here
it's
not
that
difficult
a
question.
here
the
question
is,
if
petitioner
would
have
been
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california
had
it
conducted
the
same
operations
through
a
subdivision
in
the
case,
does
the
due
process
clause
give
it
a
constitutional
right
to
avoid
that
jurisdiction
simply
by
conducting
those
same
operations
through
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary.
mr.
kevin
russell
california
wants
to
go
as
far
as
the
constitution
would
permit.
mr.
kevin
russell
not
that
there
is
unlimited
liability,
but
that
the
exercise--
mr.
kevin
russell
--because
the
statute
at
issue
doesn't
speak
to
liability.
it
speaks
to
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
russell
no.
mr.
kevin
russell
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
russell
no,
it
certainly
wouldn't.
the
choice
of
law
principles
would
almost
certainly
point
to
argentine
law.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
certainly
we
agree
that
if
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
district
court
it
would
have
discretion
to
refuse
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction.
mr.
kevin
russell
ultimately,
we
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
would
have
to
take
into
account
this
case
has
been
in
litigation
for
eight
years
already.
i
think
that's
a
substantial
reason
for
the
court
to
want
to
allow
the
case
to
continue.
i
recognize
that
we
would
have
a
very
hard
time
appealing
from
a
decision
that
refused
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction.
but
again,
on
the
question
that
the
court
actually
granted
cert
on
and
which
was
actually
preserved
here,
i
do
think
that
the
court
could
simply
hold
that,
look,
attribution
of
contacts
between
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
and
its
parents
is
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
violate
the
constitution.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
due
process
question
is
whether
the
defendant
had
sufficiently
availed
itself
of
the
benefits
of
doing
business
in
the
state
to
warrant
an
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
it
can
do
that
either
directly,
through
its--
mr.
kevin
russell
--with
respect--
mr.
kevin
russell
--with
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
justice
kennedy's
opinion
for
the
plurality
in
castro,
for
example,
identified
the
underlying
premise
of
both
general
and
specific
jurisdiction
and
availing
oneself
of
the
benefits
of
being
in
the
state.
mr.
kevin
russell
i
understand
that
there
are
very
serious
and
important
questions
with
respect
to
what
it
means
to
be
at
home
in
a
state.
and
that
if
petitioner
had
raised
those
arguments
below,
it
might
actually
have
prevailed.
but
this
court
ought
not
to
forgive
that
waiver
in
a
case
like
this
and
it
ought
not
to
decide
that
question
when
not
only
is
the
argument
forfeit,
but
it's
barely
been
briefed
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
russell
that
is--
mr.
kevin
russell
--no.
there
has
been
one
concession,
which
is
that
mbusa's
contacts
are
sufficient
to
subject
mbusa
itself
to
general
jurisdiction.
and
there's
been
one
forfeiture--
mr.
kevin
russell
--well,
because
there's
been
one
forfeiture
as
well.
and
that
is,
we've
argued
for
8--
mr.
kevin
russell
--forfeiture,
as
well.
we
have
argued
for
8
years
that
if
you
attribute
the
contacts
in
mbusa
to
daimler,
those
contacts
are
sufficient
to
establish
general
jurisdiction
over
daimler.
they're
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
minimum
contacts.
mr.
kevin
russell
that's
right.
that's
been
our
argument.
they
could
have
said
no,
that's
not
right;
they
could
have
said
mbusa
doesn't
do
enough
business
in
california.
they
could
have
said
that
general
--
that
doing
business
theory
of
general
jurisdiction
is
no
good.
they
could
have
said
you
can
only
be
subject
to
general
jurisdiction--
mr.
kevin
russell
--that's
right.
we
do
think
that
this
is
an
easier
case
because
we
have
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
that
operates
in
very
much
the
same
way
as
a
subdivision
would.
notice
that
in
the
federal--
mr.
kevin
russell
--no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
kevin
russell
but
the
question
ultimately
is
whether
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
defendant
has
sufficiently
benefitted
from--
mr.
kevin
russell
--because
unlike
a
shareholder,
a
parent
company
enjoys
not
only
the
economic
benefits
of
the
subsidiary's
activities--
mr.
kevin
russell
--they
enjoy
a
partial.
but
in
addition
they
have
--
the
parent
has
the
right
and
here
the
substantial
right
to
control
the
day
to
day--
mr.
kevin
russell
--no,
they
don't.
all
the
shareholders
have
the
right
to
do
is
appoint
the
--
the
people
to
the
board.
here,
daimler
exercised
a
degree
of
control
that
is
much
more
significant
than
that.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
i
don't
think--
mr.
kevin
russell
--i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
mean,
this
court
has
recognized
that
look,
the
due
process
clause
requires
ultimately
drawing
some
lines,
but
it
can't
be
done
in
a
mechanical
way.
here,
goodyear
provides
a
safe
harbor
to
companies
that
want
to
make
sure
that
they're
not
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california.
they
can
do
so
by
selling
their
cars
to
an
independent
distributor,
the
way
petitioner
used
to
do
and
the
way
that
toyota
still
does.
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
kevin
russell
--that's
right.
but
the
--
but
that
i
think
we
need
to
separate
the
two
ideas
of
what
does
it
take
to
make
petitioner
at
home
in
california.
once
it's
established
that
it
is
at
home
in
california,
it
is
simply
a
traditional
aspect
of
general
jurisdiction
that
it
will
be
subject
to
suit
for
things
that
happened
abroad.
if
this
suit
had
been
brought
against
apple
computer,
which
is
headquartered
in
california,
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here
today.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
--
the
conduct
in
california
is
rendered
insufficient
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
undertaken
by
a
subsidiary.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
justice
breyer,
if
you
think
--
if
you
think
that
the
--
the
proper
resolution
of
a
case
like
this
turns
on
issues
that
were
not
preserved
below
and
have
not
been
argued
here,
then
you
can
do
one
of
two
things.
mr.
kevin
russell
you
can
dismiss
the
case
as
improvidently
granted
or
you
can
decide
the
case
on
the
assumptions
upon
which
it's
been
litigated
and
make
clear
that
you're
doing
that.
mr.
kevin
russell
we
would
have
no
problem
with
that
if
you
made
clear
that
it
was
open
to
us
under
remand
to
argue
that
they
didn't
preserve
these
arguments.
that
would
be
a
fine
result
for
us.
mr.
kevin
russell
we
are
not
prepared
to
concede
that
at
this
point,
although
we
recognize
we
have
an
uphill
struggle
to
fit
ourselves
within
the
exception
that's
been
left.
principally,
our
argument
would
be
based
on
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
suit,
this
was
a
dual
american/german
company
with
dual
headquarters
in
--
in
the
united
states,
which
is
different
than
shell.
but
we're
not
prepared
to
concede
it,
but
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
resolve
it.
mr.
kevin
russell
there
is,
although--
mr.
kevin
russell
--sure.
they
could
have
asked
that.
usually
they
only
ask
those
questions--
mr.
kevin
russell
--it
wouldn't
be
if
you
sent
it
back.
i
mean,
usually
courts
of
appeals
don't
ask
those
questions
unless
somebody
asks
them
to.
and
here
petitioner
never
asked
them
to.
it
assumed,
as
did
we,
that
the
statute
meant
that
they
wanted
the
most
permissive
attribution
rule
that's
permitted
by
the
due
process
clause;
and
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
--
that's
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
recognize
that
it's
a
little
bit
problematic
that
these
statutes
don't
give
greater
definitive
guidance;
the
petitioner
hasn't
complained
about
that
either.
and
so
on
the
premises
on
which
this
case
was
litigated,
i
do
think
you
can
decide
this
case
by
resolving
two
questions:
first,
on
the
assumption
that
if
mbusa's
contacts
are
attributable
to
petitioner,
they
are
sufficient
to
make
it
at
home,
does
the
fact
that
those
contacts
are
through
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
rather
than
a
subdivision
make
the
exercise
of
general
jurisdiction
improper--
mr.
kevin
russell
--just
to
be
clear,
there
are
two
parts
to
that
rule.
there
is
one
that's
the
assertion
that
ordinarily,
you're
only
at
home
in
the
place
of
principal
business,
or
principal
--
principal
place
of
business,
or
your
place
of
incorporation.
and
the
other
is,
oh,
we'll
only
apply
that
rule
with
respect
to
subsidiary
contacts.
that
additional
thing,
which
is
necessary
to
--
to
shoehorn
it
into
this
case,
i
think,
is
very
artificial.
so
if
this
court
is
going
to--
mr.
kevin
russell
--that
we
will
only
apply
that
rule
if
the
contacts,
if
i
understand
justice
alito's
proposal,
we
only
apply
that
rule
if
the
contacts
in
the
state
are
through
a
subsidiary.
that's
a
very
artificial
gerrymander,
honestly,
to
fit
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
the
doing
business
theory
of
general
jurisdiction
is
no
longer
good
law,
it
should
do
so
directly,
it
should
do
so
when
the
case
has
actually
been
briefed.
it
hasn't
been
briefed
here.
mr.
kevin
russell
i
don't
know
that
you
can't
take
it
into
account
at
all,
but
i
will
say
that
the
constitutional
test
is
whether
it's
consistent
with
traditional
notions
of
fairness
and
justice,
meaning
traditional
american
notions
of
substantial
fairness.
mr.
kevin
russell
i
would
say
a
couple
things.
i
haven't
briefed
this,
but
this
is
what
i
would
say
in
a
brief
if
we
had
the
opportunity
to
brief
it.
and
that
is
it
has
done
billions
of
dollars
in
business
in
california.
it's--
mr.
kevin
russell
--but
the
problem
is
a
corporation
shouldn't
be
jurisdictionally
better
off
simply
because
it's
bigger
than
its
competitors
who
are
smaller
and
therefore
necessarily
do
a
bigger
portion
of
their
business
in
a
smaller
number
of
places.
i
think
there
is
a
very
significant
fairness
problem
with
the
proportionality
test
suggested
by
the
government,
again
never
raised
in
this
case.
nobody
ever
argued
that
mbusa
didn't
do
enough
business
in
california,
and
in
fact
it's
done
billions
of
dollars
of
business
there
and
it's
enjoyed
the
benefits
of
being
in
the
state,
of
doing
business
in
the
state,
to
a
far
greater
degree
than
many
of
its
competitors,
say
tesla,
which
is
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
for
suits
for
anything
that
it
does
anywhere
in
the
world.
mr.
kevin
russell
i
think
there
would
still
be
a
question
of
whether
--
they
would
be
able
to
raise
the
arguments
that
they
haven't
raised
in
other
jurisdictions.
it
may
be
that
the
billions
of
dollars
that
they
are
doing
business
in
california
is
enough,
but
the
few
millions
of
dollars
they
do
in
iowa
is
not.
mr.
kevin
russell
that
may
be
the
result.
mr.
kevin
russell
that
may
be
the
case
if
--
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
doing
business
is
enough.
back
to
the
barrow
case,
when
just
having
an
office,
a
sales
office.
another
case
that
this
court
cited
in
perkins
and
cited
in
international
shoe
as
an
example
of
a
paradigmatic
case
was
a
case
called
hausa
by
then-judge
cardozo.
it
was
a
suit
by
somebody
from
new
york,
who
sued
in
new
york,
sued
a
pennsylvania
corporation,
and
the
justification
was
it
had
a
sales
office
in
new
york.
now,
if
this
court
thinks
that
those
cases
were
wrong,
if
it
thinks
that
we
need
to
change
our
conception
of
general
jurisdiction
in
light
of
the
evolved
modern--
mr.
kevin
russell
--no.
goodyear
didn't
purport
to
change
anything.
i
know
you
used
a
new
phrase
to
describe
the
prior
precedent,
but
it
wasn't
purporting
to
revise
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
there
was
substantial
argument
in
that
case
on
that
score.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
again
if
i
can
just
respond
to
that
idea.
the
one
consequence
of
that,
and
getting
back
to
what
i
would
say
to
justice
kagan,
is
people
aren't
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
only
in
one
or
two
places.
they
are
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
anywhere
they
set
foot
and
are
served
with
process.
and
i
think
it
is
quite
unfair
to
say--
mr.
kevin
russell
--but
they
go
a
lot
of
places
over
time.
and
as
a
consequence
they
are
in
fact
in
the
course
of
living
their
lives
or
even
doing
business
in
an
unincorporated
forum
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
a
lot
of
places.
again,
this
is
an
important
question
that
hasn't
been
briefed
in
this
case,
it
wasn't
preserved
below,
and
i
think
that
you
ought
to
decide
the
case
on
the
grounds,
on
the
premises
on
which
it
has
been
litigated
for
eight
years.
and
if
you
can't
do
that
you
ought
to
dismiss
the
case
as
improvidently
granted
or
at
least
remand
the
case
to
allow
a
full
airing
of
these
issues
in
an
appropriate
forum.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
you
do
get
into
line-drawing
problems
in
this
area.
this
court
has
recognized
that
even
in
specific
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
kevin
russell
i
think
billions
of
dollars
is
enough.
mr.
kevin
russell
well,
you
have
to
pick
some
metric.
i
mean,
this
court's
cases
have
always
been
general.
they
talked
about
minimum
contacts.
they
talked
about
systematic
and
continuous
business
operations
in
the
state.
and
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
those
are
not
standards
that
are
capable
of
mechanical
operation
or
bright
line
the
rules.
if
you
think
that
you
need
to
develop
some
new
standards,
you
ought
to
do
it
in
a
case
when
it
is
squarely
presented
and
adequately
briefed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
