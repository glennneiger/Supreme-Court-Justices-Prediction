mr.

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution,
is
there
that
would
prohibit
a
state
from
adopting
a
rule
that
a
parent
is
responsible
for
any
acts
of
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
even
on
a
prospective
basis,
your
brief
talks
about
notice
and
fairness
and
predictability;
but
if
california
said
going
forward,
this
is
the
rule
that
we're
going
to
apply,
is
there
any
constitutional
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

think
there
was
a
question,
but
you
can
respond.

roberts,

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
mentioned
kiobel.
do
you
still
think
you
have
a
viable
claim
under
kiobel,
or
haven't
you
conceded
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.

you
have
four
minutes
