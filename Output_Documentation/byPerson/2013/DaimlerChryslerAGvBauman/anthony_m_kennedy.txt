justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
--
how
would
you
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question
if
you
were
writing
the
opinion
in
your
favor?
would
you
say
that
in
the
hypothetical,
daimler
chrysler
put
in
motion
a
course
of
events
that
caused
an
injury
in
california?
is
that
the
way
our
jurisprudence
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you're
going
to
answer
the
hypothetical
in
an
opinion,
how
would
you
--
what
would
you
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
daimler
has
purposely
availed
itself
of
california
jurisdiction
by
establishing
the
sub
that
--
that
operates
there
by
establishing
mercedes
u.s.,
that
it
operates
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
creating
a
subsidiary
is
not
availing
itself
of
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree.
and
i'm
asking
what
is
the
rationale
that
you
would
use
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
that
is
ruling
in
your
favor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
my
question
is
whether
or
not
by
creating
mercedes
u.s.,
daimler
didn't
purposely
avail
itself
of
the
forum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
as
a
way
of
getting
you
to
state
your
general
theory
of
the
case,
let
me
ask
you:
do
you
have
a
recommendation
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
remand
this
case?
if
we
accept
your
theory
of
the
case,
which
i'll
let
you
explain,
does
that
require
a
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
tradition,
if
you
have
the
universe
of
agent
and
principal,
an
independent
contractor,
is
the
subsidiary
of
the
latter
or
is
it
something
--
is
it
some
third
--
some
third
animal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
generally,
if
you
have
a
--
a
corporate
parent
and
a
subsidiary,
do
we
usually
think
of
a
subsidiary
as
an
agent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
think
of
it
as
--
what
do
we
think
about
it
as?
an
independent
contractor,
or
just
something
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
understood
the
concession
as
being,
that
if
mercedes
were
the
only
corporation
involved
in
this
dispute,
there
would
be
specific
--
sufficient
contacts.
that
doesn't
tell
me
anything
about
daimler.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
not
so
sure
that
this
concession
is
that
troublesome
for
daimler.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
how
does
that
answer
the
question
about
daimler?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
has
been
one--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
i
think
their
concession
is
quite
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
the
distinction
between
parent
and
subsidiary
is
meaningful
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
and
that
you're
not
just
automatically
an
--
you
yourself
do
not
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
position
that
if
daimler
gives
enough
functions
to
mercedes
that
it
has
to
give,
that
then
daimler
is
--
is
liable.
you
don't
--
your
footnote,
i
think
page
35
of
your
brief,
you
--
you
don't
take
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
to
its
full
extent.
