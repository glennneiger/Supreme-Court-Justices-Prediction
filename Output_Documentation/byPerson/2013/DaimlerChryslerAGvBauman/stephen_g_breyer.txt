justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
deal
with
that?
that's
what's
--
i
mean,
it's
in
your
interest
to
argue
that
--
tell
me
how
to
deal
with
this.
it's
perhaps
true
--
i
think
it's
true
that
a
state
doesn't
have
to
allow
companies
to
have
wholly-owned
corporations.
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
nothing
says
they
do.
or
a
state
could
say,
wholly-owned
corporations?
well,
there's
no
limited
liability.
or
they
could
say
in
certain
kinds
of
accidents,
there's
no
limited
--
et
cetera.
you
see,
they
have
lots
of
choice.
so
what
really
seems
to
have
been
going
on
here
is
the
ninth
circuit,
from
your
perspective,
just
really
misstated
california
law
by
out
to
lunch.
when
they
say
when
we
want
it
to
be
as
broad
as
the
constitution,
they
don't
mean,
because
we
could
get
rid
of
limited
liability,
that
that's
what
we
do.
so,
how
can
we
deal
with
a
circuit
court
that
seems
to
seriously
misstate
the
law
of
a
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that
that's
what
you
would
like
as
the
bottom
line.
[laughter]
i
would
like
to
know
the
chain
of
reasoning
that
gets--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really,
suppose
i
think
that
this
was
crying
out
for
an
en
banc.
after
you
got
your
decision,
we
decided
goodyear,
didn't
we?
and
yet,
even
though
there
is
no
effort
to
reconcile
the
case
with
goodyear,
as
there
couldn't
be
--
we
haven't
decided
it
--
by
the
time
we
decided
it,
it
still
could
have
been
taken
en
banc.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
we
have
no
power
at
all
to
force
the
circuit,
although
that's
what
they
are
there
for,
to
consider
such
a
matter
en
banc.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
didn't
raise
these--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now
we're
--
look
at
the
odd
thing.
it
might
not
violate
the
constitution.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
question,
but
it
is
bothering
me,
too.
it
might
not
violate
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
for
a
state
to
say
we
don't
have
limited
liability
in
respect
to
the
subsidiary
corporation
or
the
general
corporation.
it's
very
unlikely
to
do
that.
it's
going
to
be
a
big
problem
to
get
investment
in
that
state,
but
it
might
not
violate
--
it
might
not
violate
the
constitution
as
here,
to
say,
you
know,
we
are
in
california
not
going
to
have
subsidiaries
when
a
plaintiff
comes
in
and
sues
on
the
basis
of
something
that
happened
outside
the
country;
but
we
will
have
it
when,
in
fact,
he
sues
on
something
that
happened
in
california.
now,
a
state
could
do
that,
i
guess,
but
it's
pretty
odd.
and
if
you
look
what
the
--
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
its
opinion,
it
never
referred
to
california
law
directly.
it's
all
ninth
circuit
cases
or
second
circuit
cases.
the
only
thing
it
says
about
california
is
probably
something
that
was
quoted
in
that
circuit
case,
something
like
that.
so,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do,
because
state
law
is
up
to
the
state?
how
do
i
handle
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think,
in
other
words,
that
california
has
abolished
--
i
mean,
california
says
there
is
no
corporate
insulation?
a
corporation,
when
it
tries
to
work
through
a
subsidiary,
that
subsidiary
has
unlimited
liability
from
lawsuits
in
california.
is
that
what
you
think
california
law
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
then
to
my
question
is
yes.
you
think
right
today,
in
california,
the
law
is
there
is
no
--
there
is
unlimited
liability
for
a
corporation
that
is
a
subsidiary
of
another?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit,
unlimited
liability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
my
problem,
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
it's
really
--
justice
scalia
has
been
mentioning
this
problem.
you're
seeing
it
through
the
lens
of
jurisdiction.
i'm
not.
i'm
seeing
it
through
the
lens
of
corporate
law.
five
shareholders
get
together
from
outside
california
and
they
set
up
a
corporation
in
california.
why?
to
insulate
themselves
from
liability,
particularly
lawsuits.
now,
instead
of
those
five
shareholders,
everything
is
the
same,
but
now
it's
a
german
corporation
and
suddenly,
they
can't
insulate
themselves
from
the
lawsuits
in
california.
i
think
it
unlikely
that
california
would
have
such
a
corporate
law,
whether
it
goes
by
the
name
of
jurisdiction
or
some
other
name.
but
that's
a
state
law
question.
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
that's
where
we
started
this
argument.
and
that's
what
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
another
thing
we
could
do
is
we
could
say
we've
decided
now
two
cases
that
seem
to
bear
on
this,
and
one
is
goodyear
and
the
other
is
kiobel;
and
we
could
say
we'll
send
it
back
for
consideration
of
this
case
in
light
of
those.
