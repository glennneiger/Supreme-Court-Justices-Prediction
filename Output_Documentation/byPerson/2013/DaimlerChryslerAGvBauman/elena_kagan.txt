mr.
dupree
--
i'm
sorry.
please.
justice
elena
kagan
and,
mr.
dupree,
even
if
you
waived
that
point,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
you
did
not
waive
the
point
that
even
with
all
attribution
in
the
world,
there
still
is
no
general
jurisdiction
over
daimler.
in
other
words,
you
could
attribute
all
mbusa's
contacts
and
you
still
would
not
have
general
jurisdiction
over
daimler;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
so
in
that
sense,
it
really
doesn't
depend
on
the
attribution
standard,
all
these
hard
questions
of
is
it
an
alter
ego
test
or
is
it
an
agency
test
and
how
does
the
constitution
relate
to
state
law,
because
we
could
apply
any
test
we
wanted,
and
there
still
wouldn't
be
general
jurisdiction
over
daimler
in
california.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dupree--
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kneedler,
what
do
you
think
about
this,
that
--
you
know,
as
i've
been
looking
through
these
cases,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
these
attribution
issues
and
the
conflict
about
attribution
arises
because
courts
generally
have
an
improperly
broad
understanding
of
general
jurisdiction
and
don't
quite
understand
the
distinction
between
general
and
specific
jurisdiction.
if
the
courts
--
if
the
court
here
had
understood
that
general
jurisdiction
applies
when
a
company
is
essentially
at
home
in
a
place,
would
any
of
these
questions
have
arisen?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
of
course,
that
just
points
out
the
difference
between
specific
and
general
jurisdiction,
that
daimler
might
be
--
might
be
found
--
found
it
--
there's
jurisdiction
over
daimler
in
a
case
which
involves
the
blowing
up
of
a
car
in
california,
but
not
over
something
that's
not
related
to
any
of
its
contacts
in
california.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but,
mr.
russell,
it's
usually
--
it
doesn't
lead
to
good
results
when
you
assume
something
that
is
obviously
in
error.
you
know,
it
leads
you
to
go
onto
a
road
that
you
wouldn't
otherwise
have
gone
onto
and
get
to
a
destination
that
might
be
improper
itself.
so
it's
bad
practice,
and
i
understand
your,
you
know,
idea
about
they
didn't
argue
this,
they
didn't
argue
that.
but
to
assume
something
that's
obviously
a
fallacy
as
your
basis
for
a
decision
is
not
likely
to
lead
you
to
a
good
outcome.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
russell,
they
did
talk
about
daimler
wasn't
subject
to
general
jurisdiction.
they
didn't
contest
mbusa's
being
subject
to
general
jurisdiction,
but
they
said
daimler
isn't
subject
to
general
jurisdiction.
so,
you
know,
they
didn't
make
the
precise
argument
that
they
should
have
made,
but
they
basically
put
the
question
at
issue:
is
daimler
subject
to
general
jurisdiction?
answer:
no.
daimler
is
a
german
corporation.
if
it
were
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california,
so
too
it
would
be
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
every
state
in
the
united
states,
and
all
of
that
has
got
to
be
wrong.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
russell,
how
would
you
make
the
argument,
and
again
with
justice
alito,
sort
of
putting
these
waiver
questions
aside
for
a
second,
a
german
corporation
incorporated
in
germany,
headquartered
in
germany,
2.4
percent
of
its
sales
are
in
california.
how
do
you
argue
that
it's
subject
to
jurisdiction,
general
jurisdiction,
not
specific
jurisdiction,
general
jurisdiction,
which
means
over
suits
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
california
or
indeed,
as
here,
over
in
the
united
states,
have
anything
to
do
with
anything
that
happened
in
the
united
states.
how
do
you
make
the
argument
that
daimler
is
subject
to
general
jurisdiction?
justice
elena
kagan
it's
2.4
percent
of
its
sales.
that
would
make
it
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
every
place.
justice
elena
kagan
if
it
is
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
california,
is
it
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
all
49
other
states?
justice
elena
kagan
so
everybody
is
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
in
like
california
and
new
york
and
florida
because
they
are
big
markets,
but
no
worries
about,
you
know,
delaware?
justice
elena
kagan
that's
a
bad
example.

island.
