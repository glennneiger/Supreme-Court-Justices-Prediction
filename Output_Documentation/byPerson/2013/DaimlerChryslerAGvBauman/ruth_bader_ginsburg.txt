justice

bader

we
would
never
get
to
this
question
if
you
hadn't
conceded
that
there
is
general
jurisdiction
over
the
u.s.
subsidiary,
over
--
what
is
it
--
mbusa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
there
were
nothing
to
attribute,
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
if
there
was
--
if
there
was
not
general
jurisdiction
over
mbusa,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
--
we
can't
resolve
it
that
way
since
you
--
you
didn't
challenge
the
general
jurisdiction
over
the
subsidiary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
but
suppose
we
had
a
case
of
an
accident
on
a
california
highway
injuring
california
people
and
they
sued
charging
that
the
mercedes
benz
was
defectively
manufactured.
would
there
be
jurisdiction
over
both
the
parent
and
the
sub
in
that
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
does
that
mean?
i
mean,
it
certainly
wanted
to
have
its
cars
sold
in
--
in
california.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
was
injury
in
the
forum
and
it
was
caused
by
defective
manufacturing
abroad.
that's
a
typical
basis
for
jurisdiction
under
long
arm
statutes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does
--
it
does
provide
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
the
limits
of
due
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
--
that
was
conceded.
but
that
was
--
there
is
a
very
substantial
argument
that
there
was
no
general
jurisdiction
over
the
subsidiary,
but
that
was
not
contested
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
a
party
can
always
consent
to
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
don't
--
you
wouldn't
have
any
doubt,
would
you,
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
pose.
a
mercedes
benz
car
causes
an
accident
--
there's
an
accident
in
california.
it's
alleged
that
the
accident
was
the
defective
manufacturing
of
that
car.
california
people
are
injured.
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
a
california
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
a
mercedes
benz
vehicle
overturned
in
poland
and
injured
the
polish
driver
and
passenger,
suit
for
the
design
defect
could
be
brought
in
california?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
year
of
that
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
thinking
about
jurisdiction
has
changed
enormously
since
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
was
ever
an
example
of
a
corporation
being
at
home
in
a
particular
place,
it's
perkins
against
benguet.
it
was
a
philippine
company
that
was
shut
down
entirely.
it
was
world
war
ii.
to
the
extent
the
company
was
operating
at
all,
it
was
in
ohio.
it
was
not
able
to
operate
in
what
otherwise
would
have
been
its
home
base.
so
everything
that
the
corporation
was
doing
occurred
in
ohio.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
why
should
we
--
now
that
the
federal
claims
are
out
--
i
mean,
when
you
started
the
suit
you
had
a
claim
under
the
alien
tort
statute,
you
had
a
claim
under
the
torture
victims
protection
act,
but
now
those
federal
claims
are
out
and
we
are
left
with
a
claim
under
california
law
and
argentinian
law.
why
should
a
federal
forum
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
those
claims
once
the
federal
claims
are
out
of
the
picture?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
be
arbitrary
for
it
to
exercise
personal
jurisdiction
when
there
is
no
federal
claim
and
the
case
involves
foreign
plaintiffs
injured
abroad,
allegedly
due
to
the
activities
of
a
subsidiary
operating
abroad?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that
test
that
you
just
--
the
sufficiently
purposeful
availing,
those
are
all
specific
jurisdiction
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
not
general
jurisdiction
questions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
goodyear
distinguished
the
two
by
saying
general
jurisdiction
means
it's
equivalent
to
residence
for
an
individual.
it's
where
you
are
at
home.
and
general
jurisdiction
was
much
broader
in
the
days
before
long
arm
statutes.
but
now
that
we
have
specific
jurisdiction
so
you
can
sue
where
the
event
occurred,
just
as
specific
jurisdiction
has
expanded,
so
general
jurisdiction
has
shrunk.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
any
claim
arising
anyplace
in
the
world.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
go
--
if
you
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
foundation
case
of
international
shoe.
that
case
recognized
that
you
can
be
an
agent
for
one
purpose,
but
not
for
another.
so
the
people
--
the
salesmen
who
were
promoting
the
sales
of
shoes
were
the
agents
of
international
shoe
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
sale
of
shoes.
they
were
not
an
all-purpose
agent
for
the
purpose
of,
say,
dealing
--
real
estate
dealings
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
so
you
could
have
an
agency
for
one
purpose,
selling
cars
in
california,
but
totally
unrelated
to
torturing
people
in
argentina.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
additional
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
did
say
in
your
brief
that
recognizing
that
other
nations
are
highly
critical
of
our
expansive,
one-time
expansive,
notion
of
doing
business
as
a
basis
for
general
jurisdiction,
you
say
that
that
shouldn't
be
taken
into
account
as
a
basis
for
constitutional
decisionmaking.
and
yet
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
notion
of
whether
it's
fair
and
reasonable
to
require
a
corporation
to
answer
in
a
forum,
and
is
what
the
other
countries
think
unenlightening
on
what's
fair
and
reasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
exactly
what
goodyear
held?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
would
hardly
be
room
for
a
decision
next
to
goodyear
that
says,
oh,
for
general
jurisdiction
purposes
it's
enough
that
you
have
some
subsidiary
operating
in
the
state.
the
whole
idea
of
goodyear
was
to
say
there
is
one
place
you
can
always
sue
a
corporation,
one
or
two,
place
of
incorporation,
a
principal
place
of
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
people
can
be
only
one
place
at
a
time.
