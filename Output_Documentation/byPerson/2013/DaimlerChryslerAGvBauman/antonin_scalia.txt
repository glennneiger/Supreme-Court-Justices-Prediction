justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
reach
that
question?
i
mean,
i
guess
the
ninth
circuit
must
have
been
interpreting
the
long-arm
statute
of
california,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
are
there
--
were
there
california
cases
that
disregarded
the
--
the
corporate
forum?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
is
conducted
on
the
basis
of
the
california
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
it's
--
it's
california's
reference
to
the
outer
bounds
of
jurisdiction
that
causes
--
causes
this
to
be
a
constitutional
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
foreign
--
foreign
countries
resolve
this
attribution
question?
would
--
would
we
be
standing
alone
or
are
there
a
lot
of
other
countries
that
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
parent,
if
there
is
general
jurisdiction
over
the
sub?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
and
large?
who
are
the
small?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i've
been
looking
for
the
text
of
the
california
jurisdiction
statute.
where
is
it?
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
in
your
brief?
is
it
in
the
respondent's
brief?
is
it
in
the
government's
brief?
i
can't
find
the
darn
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
the
cite.
i
want
the
text
in
front
of
me
right
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
briefs
are
supposed
to
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
--
all
of
the
significant
statutes
that
--
that
relate
to
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
the
california
civil
code.
you're
saying
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
briefing?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
russell,
i'm
still
hung
up
on
--
on
why
we
have
to
confront
a
federal
constitutional
question.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
a
state
statute
which
says
we
want
to
exercise
jurisdiction
to
the
extent
the
constitution
permits
--
i
don't
think
that
invites
a
court
to
restructure
standard
state
law
and
to
say
we're
not
going
to
observe
the
corporate
distinction.
i
guess
you'd
have
to
say
we
can
hold
the
individual
shareholders
of
a
corporation
liable,
because
that
might
not
violate
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
that
when
california
adopts
this
statute
it
means
to
change
its
standard
law
regarding
corporations,
regarding
individuals,
and
so
forth.
why
should
we
assume
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
russell,
does
it
not
follow
from
--
from
your
argument
that
a
federal
court
should
entertain
a
suit
against
the
shareholders
of
a
foreign
corporation
when
that
foreign
corporation
has
sufficient
contacts
in
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
it
any
less
fair?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
the
shareholders?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
the
shareholders?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
can't
see
a
distinction.
and
i
think
if
you
stretch
the
california
statute
as
far
as
you're
stretching
it,
you
--
you
have
to
assume
that
california
would
exercise
jurisdiction
in
that
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you're
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
this
is
as
--
as
justice
breyer
and
i
seem
to
think,
a
question
of
state
law,
don't
you
think
it's
extraordinary
that
the
ninth
circuit
could
make
such
a
significant
holding
on
--
on
california
law
without
--
there
is
a
certification
procedure
in
california,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
--
why
wouldn't
they
have
asked
the
california
supreme
court
whether
--
whether
this
jurisdiction
statute
was
meant
to
alter
corporate
law
or,
you
know,
tort
law,
or,
you
know
--
just
imagine
any
change
in
law
that
would
bear
upon
jurisdiction,
and
all
those
changes
must
be
assumed
to
have
happened.
couldn't
--
couldn't
they
ask
that?
is
that
what
this
california
jurisdictional
statute
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
too
late
to
ask
it
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
should
be
billions
of
dollars,
right,
that
percentage,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we've
got
to
pick
a
dollar
amount
rather
than
a
percentage.
