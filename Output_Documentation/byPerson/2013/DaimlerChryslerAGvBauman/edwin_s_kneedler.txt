mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
several
questions
from
the
court
suggest,
the
due
process
clause
itself
does
not
supply
fixed
rules
for
the
attribution
of
forum
contacts
from
one
corporation
to
another.
rather,
such
rules
are
the
province
of
the
positive
law
that
creates
the
corporation
and
other
substantive
law
such
as
agency
that
defines
the
relationship
of
that
juridical
person
to
other
persons.
and
those
rules
are
the
ones
that
the
corporations
themselves
rely
upon
and
that
others
who
deal
with
the
corporations
rely
upon.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
in
the
instance
you're
talking
about
in
taxation
--
and
this
is
related
to
a
question
the
chief
justice
asked
--
the
due
process
clause
does
not
itself
prohibit
a
state
or
the
federal
government
from
attributing
substantive
liability,
for
example,
from
a
--
from
a
subsidiary
to
a
parent,
or,
in
the
case
of
taxation,
of
choosing
to
look
at
the
entire
enterprise
of
which
the
parent
corporation
is
the
head.
but
those
are
the
results
of
deliberate
choices
by
the
lawmaking
organs
of
the
state,
which
they
--
legislature,
or
when
congress
does
it,
the
federal
government.
they
do
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--reflect
a
general
determination
that
in
all
circumstances,
the
acts
of
the
nation
or
the
acts
of
a
subsidiary
should
be
attributed
to
the
parent.
in
fact,
the
general
rule
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
no,
they
are
not.
and
--
and
for
the
taxation,
there
has
to
--
for
taxation
to
begin
with,
there
has
to
be
some
nexus
between
the
individual
and
the
--
and
the
state.
the
rules
that
i
think
justice
sotomayor
was
talking
about
in
the
federal
tax
code
has
similar
provisions,
really
have
to
do
with
the
measure
of
taxation.
and
in
most
of
those
situations,
certainly,
in
taxation
among
the
states,
there
is
an
apportionment
formula.
yes,
the
--
the
overall
income
may
be
lumped
together
for
purposes
of
--
of
the
initial
step,
but
then
there's
an
apportionment
formula
that
says
that
--
in
the
mobil
case
that's
cited
in
the
briefs,
for
example,
that
--
that
vermont
can
only
tax
so
much
of
it,
that
portion
that
is
fairly
attributable
to
vermont.
so
in
that
sense,
it's
analogous
to
a
specific
jurisdiction.
you're
looking
at
--
you're
coming
up
with
some
formula
to
tie
the
taxation
to
the
state
that
is
imposing
--
imposing
the
tax.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
probably
not.
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
think
it's
page
23
of
its
opinion
--
says
that
the
reason
that
it
looked
to
the
--
the
question
of
whether
the
in-state
activities
of
mbusa
were
important
to
daimler
was
that
the
importance
is
a
measure
of
the
presence,
meaning
essentially
doing
business
within
--
within
california.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
to
this
traces
back
to
early
new
york
cases
that
--
that
address
the
question
of
doing
business
at
a
time
when
the
business--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
now
--
but
i
think
in
a
broader
matter
--
and
also,
i
take
the
point
that
justice
kagan
made
earlier
that
even
--
even
if
mbusa
was
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
or
if
we
--
if
that's
accepted
for
these
purposes,
that
doesn't
mean
that
daimler
--
you
wouldn't
attribute
mbusa's
jurisdictional
status
to
daimler.
you
might
attribute
its
contacts,
if
the
appropriate
rules
for
attribution
of
contacts
work
in
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
--
it
does
not.
and
in
our
view--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
in
--
in
our
view,
it's
proper
for
the
--
for
the
court
to
look
to
background
principles
of
corporate
law
at
least
as
a
starting
point
or
as
a
presumptive
matter.
and
in
this
country,
corporate
separateness,
under
which
a
parent
is
not
liable
for
the
acts
of
a
subsidiary,
is
the
general
rule.
there
are
established
exceptions
to
that,
traditional
exceptions:
the
alter
ego
exception,
and
the
situation
where
a
principal
is
responsible
for
the
acts
of
an
agent.
attribution
on
those
bases,
because
they're
traditional,
would
not
offend
traditional
notions
of
--
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice
under
the
due
process
clause.
here,
respondent
does
not
argue
--
respondents
do
not
argue
for
an
--
that
alter
ego
would
satisfy.
and
as
for
agency,
there's
no
argument
here
that
traditional
agency
requirements
are
satisfied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
--
i
think
in
this
case
--
again,
we
don't
have
any
reference
to
--
at
all--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
you
do
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
an
independent
entity.
it
may
be
doing
work
for
the
parent,
or
it
may
not.
in
this
case,
at
page
179a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
agreement
between
daimler
and
--
and
mbusa
specifically
provides
that
mbusa
is
neither
a
special
nor
a
general
agent.
it
says
that
mbusa
cannot
act
on
behalf
of
or
bind
daimler,
and
it's
not
a
fiduciary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
would
think
so,
particularly
given
the
--
given
the
agreement
in
this
case
which
obligates
daimler
to
market
throughout
the
50
states,
and
the
volume
of
sales
that
are
directed
to
the
united
states,
some
major
portion
of
which
is
expected
to
be
and
intended
to
be
in
california.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
question
that
california
would
have
specific
jurisdiction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
that
is
--
that
is
the
--
the
major
--
that
is
the
major
difference.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
i
could
make
a
point.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
--
i
think
mbusa
would
have
to
be
acting
on
behalf
of
daimler.
one
step
in
that
direction
would
be
if
daimler
consigned
the
cars
to
--
to
mbusa
and
that
--
and
mbusa
held
itself
out
as
the
sales
agent.
here,
the
cars
were
sold
to
mbusa
in
germany
and
--
and
sent
to
the
united
states.
but
if
there
was
an
agency
relationship,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
daimler
would
be
at
home
in
--
in
california
or
whatever--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
--
under
this
agreement,
mbusa
is
--
acts
independently.
it
does
not
act
day
to
day
directly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
those
are
contractual
undertakings.
they
are
not
the
manifestations
of
agency.
agency
would
require
that
--
that
daimler
control
the
day-to-day
operations
of
this
subsidiary.
and
at
page
116a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
district
court
says
there's
no
evidence
of
that
whatsoever.
