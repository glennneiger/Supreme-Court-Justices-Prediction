if

if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
test
should
be
whether
the
subsidiary
is
an
alter
ego
of
the
parent,
would
that
depend
on
the
--
the
law
of
the
particular
state
in
which
the
suit
is
brought
or
would
it
be
based
on
some
general
understanding
of
alter
ego
liability?

that
would
mean
that
due
process
would
mean
something
different
potentially
in
california
and
new
york,
for
example.
wouldn't
that
be
rather
strange?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
the
situation
of
individuals,
does
the
--
does
the
due
process
rule
regarding
taxation
of
individuals
by
a
state
align
with
the
--
the
ability
of
somebody
to
sue
that
person
in
the
state?
somebody
--
for
example,
if
someone
is
a
partner
in
a
law
firm
that
has
offices
all
over
the
country,
they
may
be
paying
income
taxes
in
many
jurisdictions.
are
they
subject
to
general
jurisdiction?
if
there's
a
--
if
you
have
somebody
who
works
in
d.c.
and
never
goes
to
california
but
has
to
pay
some
income
tax
in
california,
are
they
subject
to
suit
in
california
for
any--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--claim
that
arises
against
them
anywhere?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
would
have
to
be--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
would
have
to
be
true
for
mbusa
to
be
daimler's
agent
with
respect
to
general
jurisdiction?
how
would
the
facts
of
this
case
have
to
be
changed
in
order
to
bring
this
within
an
agency
principle?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--mr.
russell,
is
it
clear
that
the
california
law
regarding
corporate
liability
would
apply
to
all
of
your
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
federal
claims,
you
have
argentine
claims;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
california
law
controls
personal
jurisdiction.
it
doesn't,
does
it,
necessarily
control
corporate
liability,
let's
say,
with
respect
to
the
argentine
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
isn't
a
preservation
issue
regarding
this
in-home
--
this
at-home
question,
why
shouldn't
the
rule
be
that
unless
a
corporation
is
incorporated
in
the
jurisdiction
or
has
its
principal
place
of
business
in
the
jurisdiction,
the
--
the
acts
of
the
subsidiary
are
not
attributable
unless
it's
an
alter
ego.
it's
a
nice
clean
rule;
many
of
the
prominent
scholars
in
this
area
think
that
the
american
doctrine
of
general
jurisdiction
doesn't
serve
any
good
purpose.
now
that
specific
jurisdiction
has
been
expanded,
it
makes
us
an
international
outlier.
why
shouldn't
we
have
a
nice
clear
rule
like
that,
and
everybody
will
know
exactly
where
things
stand?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
this
2.4
percent
figure
is
important,
wouldn't
we
get
into
impossible
line-drawing
problems?
what
if
it
was
1.4
percent?
