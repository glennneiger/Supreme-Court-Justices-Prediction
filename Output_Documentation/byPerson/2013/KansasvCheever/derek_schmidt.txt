mr.
derek
schmidt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
once
the
respondent
made
the
trial
decision
to
make
his
mental
status
an
issue
and
then
supported
his
argument
by
introducing
as
evidence
the
testimony
of
a
mental
health
expert
who
had
examined
the
defendant,
he
no
longer
could
properly
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
avoid
like
kind
rebuttal
by
another
court-appointed
expert.
when
the
kansas
supreme
court
allowed
the
respondent
to
do
just
that,
it
committed
constitutional
error
and
should
be
reversed
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
court's
cases
point
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
second,
allowing
this
mental
or
mental
expert
rebuttal
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedent
with
the
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
is
fair.
and
third,
a
holding
that
is
consistent
with
the
kansas
supreme
court's
rule
would
have
the
effect
of
undermining
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial
by
excluding
relevant
evidence
from
the
jury,
especially
in
the
mental
health
context
where
the
jury
has
to
make
an
assessment
based
upon--
mr.
derek
schmidt
--it
--
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
we're
not
asking
for
a
rule
that
that's
--
that
is
that
broad.
we're
asking
for
a
rule
of
parity
that
allows
that
once
the
defendant
has
opened
the
door
by
putting
his
own
expert
on,
the
government
may
respond
in
kind.
mr.
derek
schmidt
your
honor,
that
may
well
be
true
and
the
language
of
this
court's
precedence
through
smith
and
buchanan,
for
example,
suggests
that
the
rule
may
be
broader
than
the
minimum
that
we're
asking
for
today.
mr.
derek
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
derek
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
fifth
amendment,
of
course,
is
implicated
when
we're
talking
about
a
mental
health
expert
who
has
conducted
an
examination
of
the
defendant
and
the
respondent.
that's
what
we
believe
is
appropriate
here
in
terms
of
the
parity
rule.
once
the
defendant
puts
on
his
expert,
who
has
done
so,
the
government
may
respond
in
kind.
mr.
derek
schmidt
and,
your
honor,
the
--
the
hypothetical
your
honor
posits
is
closely
related
to
the
second
question
kansas
presented,
which
was
not
granted
in
this
case,
which
would
be
the
impeachment
use
once
the
defendant
himself
has
testified.
mr.
derek
schmidt
your
honor,
kansas
law
makes
the
distinction
between
voluntary
intoxication
as
a
defense
and
mental
disease
or
defect
as
a
defense.
and
it
does
provide
a
mechanism
under
the
mental
disease
pleadings
for
the
obtaining
of
a
court-ordered
mental
evaluation,
not
under
the
other.
mr.
derek
schmidt
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
correct
that
kansas
could
not
have
called
a
witness
under
a
voluntary
intoxication
defense
--
could
not
have
obtained
a
court-ordered
mental
evaluation.
that
is
correct.
the
reason
i
didn't
merely
say
yes
is
we
do
have
some
disagreement
with
the
other
side
that
would
be
dealt
with
in
the
courts
below
as
to
whether
this
truly
was
a
voluntary
intoxication
defense,
since
the
other
side's
expert
did
put
the
long-term
effects
on
the
defendant's
mental
capacity
into
issue
based
on
his
methamphetamine
use.
mr.
derek
schmidt
justice
alito--
mr.
derek
schmidt
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
compulsion
question
is
a
threshold
question.
and
to
the
extent
this
court
has
recognized,
for
example,
in
cases
like
ventris,
that
there
are
truly
compelled
statements
in
a
portash
or
mincey
sort
of
circumstance,
that
threshold
issue
would
resolve
it.
this
is
not
that
case.
in
fact,
any
compulsion
that
might
be
involved
here
is
much
closer
to
what
happens
when
a
defendant
makes
a
trial
decision
to
offer
himself
as
a
witness
and
go
on
the
stand,
and
then,
as
a
matter
of
operation
of
law,
must
subject
himself
to
cross-examination.
mr.
derek
schmidt
that
would
certainly
be
true,
justice
alito,
absolutely.
mr.
derek
schmidt
if
the
compulsion
test
settles
the
matter,
justice
alito,
yes,
that
is
correct.
even
if
it
doesn't
settle
the
matter,
we
think
there
was
then
subsequently
a
waiver
at
the
time
the
evidence
was
introduced
in
the
state's
trial.
mr.
derek
schmidt
your
honor,
i
think
it
can.
there
is
some
dispute
between
the
parties
on
whether
there
is
a
sort
of
category
of
compulsion,
called
something
else
perhaps,
which
doesn't
rise
to
the
portash-mincey
constitutional
bar
standard.
for
example,
the
respondent
has
argued
that,
although
this
may
not
be
like
portash
and
mincey,
there
is
still
nonetheless
some
inappropriate
burden
upon
the
choice
that
was
made
and
that
that
is
somehow
constitutionally
suspect.
so
i'm
merely
trying
not
to
concede
the
ground
that
even
if
--
and
i
agree
with
you
--
there
was
not
constitutionally
barred
compulsion
here,
still,
there
is
a
way
for
kansas
to
prevail
in
the
case.
mr.
derek
schmidt
your
honor,
i
don't
know
why
the
kansas
supreme
court
chose
to
settle
this
by
interpreting
the
fifth
amendment
in
a
manner
that
we
believe
is
incorrect.
but
nonetheless,
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
derek
schmidt
your
honor,
i
suspect
that
if
this
case
is
remanded,
there
will
be
a
variety
of
other
issues
presented
to
the
kansas
court
and
it
will
have
to
determine
how
to
resolve
them.
mr.
derek
schmidt
justice
ginsburg,
it
may
well
be
likely
that
upon
remand
the
scope
issue
would
come
before
the
kansas
court
to
be
resolved
under
principles
of
kansas
evidentiary
law.
in
this
case,
of
course,
while
it's
been
argued
at
some
length
by
respondent,
we
don't
think
the
scope
question
is
necessarily
or
properly
in
front
of
this
court.
it
was
a
threshold
determination
made
by
the
kansas
court
that
the
fifth
amendment
keeps
our
rebuttal
witness
off
the
stand
at
all.
and
we
have
to
get
past
that
in
order
to
get
to
related
questions.
mr.
derek
schmidt
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
question
of
fifth
amendment
law.
the
kansas
supreme
court
interpreted
the
fifth
amendment
as
creating
a
bar
upon
dr.
welner's
testimony.
mr.
derek
schmidt
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
fifth
amendment
context
that
there
are
outer
constitutional
bounds
with
respect
to
scope.
for
example,
the
relevancy
statute
you
recognized
in
both
brown
and
magatha.
but
those
are
not
implicated
here.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
sorts
of
allegations
that
respondent
is
now
making,
although
they
weren't
objected
to
at
trial
with
respect
to
specific
aspects,
would
be
matters
resolved
under
the
kansas
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
derek
schmidt
justice
breyer,
if
the
court
wishes
to
speak
to
scope,
i
think
it
could
reaffirm
that
the
constitutional
standard,
as
it
suggested
in
both
magatha
and
brown,
is
reasonably
related
or
relevant
to
the
--
the
direct
examination.
mr.
derek
schmidt
“
reasonably
related
”
was
the
phrase.
mr.
derek
schmidt
and
on
the
facts
here,
your
honor,
we
think
there
are
very
good
facts
on
both
sides
that
i
suspect
this
court
doesn't
want
to--
mr.
derek
schmidt
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
derek
schmidt
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
derek
schmidt
if
it
is
not
constitutionally
impermissible
in
the
nature
of
the
compulsion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
derek
schmidt
yes.
mr.
derek
schmidt
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
if
the
court
wishes
to
go
beyond
the
rule
that
we're
requesting
in
that
regard,
i
would
suggest
it
analyze
the
factors
that
were
articulated
by
the
court
in
the
murphy
case
in
1964.
that
would
be
the
case
where
the
court
catalogued
the
values
that
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
on
self-incrimination,
mandatory
self-incrimination.
mr.
derek
schmidt
i
believe
it
is
not
the
case
before
us,
your
honor.
i
believe
we
wouldn't
want
to
concede
there
are
other
circumstances
where
it
might
be
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
derek
schmidt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
refocus
on
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
the
kansas
supreme
court
interpreted,
or
we
believe
misinterpreted,
the
fifth
amendment
to
say
that
once
the
defendant
had
put
his
own
expert
on
the
stand
to
testify
in
support
of
his
mental
health
claim
after
this
expert
had
examined
the
defendant,
the
government
couldn't
respond
in
kind.
and
it's
that
bar
on
our
participating
in
the
factfinding
in
front
of
the
jury
that
we
are
seeking
to
have
overturned
here.
mr.
derek
schmidt
i
think,
your
honor,
the
simmons
circumstance
is
not
applicable
here
and,
in
fact,
the
court
would
have
to
substantially
expand
simmons
in
order
to
find
it
to
fit
these
facts.
mr.
derek
schmidt
well,
your
honor,
in
the
simmons
case,
what
the
government
sought
to
do
was
to
take
the
defendant's
unvarnished
statements
from
the
prior
hearing
and
to
introduce
them
without
the
defendant
having
put
those
issues
into
the
fact-finding
portion
of
the
trial
as
affirmative
evidence
in
the
government's
case-in-chief.
in
that
regard,
it
is
much
more
like
smith
on
its
facts,
where
the
court
said
even
in
the
circumstances
we're
confronted
with
here,
on
those
facts,
we
can't
do
it.
the
court
specifically
said
later
in
the
salvucci
case
that
it
hadn't
addressed
the
question
in
simmons
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
could
use
that
evidence
from
the
suppression
hearing
for
impeachment
purposes,
which
is
much
more
analogous
here.
so
it's
an
open
question
even
under
simmons,
even
if
it
applied,
and
the
court
would
have
to
extend
it
in
that
regard.
the
court,
i
would
suggest,
shouldn't
extend
simmons
in
that
regard
because,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
other
differing
--
different
factor
here
--
and
it
goes
to
the
line
of
question
that
started
earlier
--
is
that
there
is
something
different,
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized,
in
the
nature
that
--
the
actual
nature
of
use
and
obtaining
of
mental
health
evidence.
that's
the
ink
that
fires.
mr.
derek
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
derek
schmidt
in
fact,
on
the
record
here,
the
government's
expert,
dr.
welner,
specifically
advised
the
respondent
before
the
examination
began
that
if
at
any
point
he
wanted
to
terminate
the
examination,
he
was
free
to
do
so.
so
i
think
yes.
mr.
derek
schmidt
well,
on
--
on
particular
questions,
i
suppose
the
respondent
could
invoke
at
that
time.
but
more
importantly,
before
any
of
that
could
be
introduced
at
trial,
there
would
be
a
report
generated
by
the
expert,
and
all
counsel,
including
the
respondent's
counsel,
would
have
ability
to
review
it
and
seek
some
sort
of
pretrial
order
to
keep
out
any
particularly
offensive
materials.
there
are
mechanisms
to
resolve
any
problems
like
that
that
might
arise.
mr.
derek
schmidt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
the
--
the
key
difference
in
simmons
and
the
reason
its
reasoning
shouldn't
be
applied
here
is
that
the
distinction
we've
been
drawing
from
the
start
of
this
case
is
that
what
we
want
is
a
rule
of
parity.
we
want
to
be
able
to
rebut
what
the
defendant
himself
put
in
issue
in
front
of
the
jury.
and
that's
not
simmons.
