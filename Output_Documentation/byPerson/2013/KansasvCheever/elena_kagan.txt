ms.
saharsky--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
wondering
whether
you
way
overread
the
cases
that
you
rely
on,
because
in
all
of
those
cases
what
we
were
talking
about
was
an
examination
that
had
specifically
requested
by
the
defendant.
now,
here
that's
not
the
case.
the
defendant
has
asked
for
something
and
has
opened
the
door
conceivably.
but
the
examination
that
we're
talking
about
is
one
that
the
state
has
compelled
and
that
the
defendant
does
not
wish
to
undergo.
that's
a
big
difference
between
this
case
and
all
the
ones
you
rely
on.
justice
elena
kagan
not
to
belabor
this,
but
the
--
the
holding
of
the
case
is
that
the
prosecution
may
rebut
this
presentation
with
evidence
from
the
reports
of
the
examination
that
the
defendant's
requested.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean
--
i
guess
the
question
is
that
you
say
it's
a
factual
difference;
it
might
be
a
factual
difference
between
compulsion
and
lack
of
compulsion.
justice
elena
kagan
so
is
that
a
waiver
theory?
because
justice
scalia's
opinion
was
not
based
on
a
waiver
theory.
but
my
understanding
of
your
brief
was
that
you
were
arguing
about
waiver,
is
that
right;
that
the
--
the
defendant
here
has
waived
the
ability
to
say
that
he's
being
compelled?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
if
that's
policy,
why
isn't
the
--
the
cross-examination
analogy
policy
as
well?
i
mean,
they
are
both
based
on
some
notion
of
what
is
parity
and
what's
reciprocity
and
what's
--
you
know,
what's
appropriate
to
ask
the
defendant
to
bear
once
the
defendant
decides
to
become
a
witness
in
a
proceeding.
so
they
are
both
the
same
kind
of
policy.
you
want
to
call
it
that,
but
it's
--
it's
--
one
is
no
more
policy
than
the
other.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
katyal,
could
i
go
back
to
the
cross-examination
analogy.
because
you
say
your
case
is
different,
but
i
think
you'll
have
to
explain
that
one
to
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
cross-examination
cases
say
you
can't
become
a
witness
halfway.
once
you've
decided
to
become
a
witness,
you
have
to
subject
yourself
to
all
the
things
that
every
other
witness
is
subjected
to.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
haven't
convinced
me
that
the
same
point
isn't
true
here,
that
the
person,
mr.
cheever,
has
decided
to
become
a
witness
essentially
by
giving
an
interview
to
his
own
expert
and
allowing
his
own
expert
to
speak
about
what
mr.
cheever
has
told
him.
and
so,
you
know,
he
can't
do
it
halfway.
now
the
government
has
to
get
its
shot.
same
way.
