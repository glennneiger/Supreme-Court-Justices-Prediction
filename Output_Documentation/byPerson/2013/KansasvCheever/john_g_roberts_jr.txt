justice

g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-609,
kansas
v.
cheever.
general
schmidt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
--
even
if
the
defendant
does
not
submit
an
expert
of
his
own,
but
simply
puts
his
mental
state
in
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
it
only
be
for
--
why
would
it
only
be
for
impeachment
purposes?
it's
directed
at
some
statements
that
he
said,
which
are
not
going
--
not
terribly
pertinent
to
the
mental
diagnosis,
but
valuable
evidence,
and
the
defendant
takes
the
stand;
can
the
government
call
--
here's
this
person,
he
happens
to
be
the
doctor
that
took
the
--
the
examination,
but
he
learned
some
things
here
that
we
think
are
helpful.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
just
the
fact
that
the
evidence
here
is
based
on
the
defendant's
statements.
if
you
had
a
physical
object,
you
wouldn't
say
it's
the
--
the
murder
weapon.
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
the
defendant
submits
a
study
about
the
murder
weapon,
the
ballistics,
this
and
that,
you
wouldn't
say,
well,
all
the
government
can
do
is
cross-examine
the
defendant's
expert.
you
say,
no,
they
get
to
do
their
own
study.
the
reality
of
what
makes
this
different
is
that
here
when
you're
submitting
and
preparing
psychiatric
evidence,
it's
based
on
--
the
ballistics
testing
is
statements
from
--
from
the
defendant,
and
it
seems
to
me
unfair
to
say
the
defendant's
expert
has
access
to
that
ballistics
evidence,
but
the
state
does
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
understand
that.
but
it
just
so
happens
that
the
way
you
do
the
--
the
testing
on
the
evidence
when
you're
talking
about
psychiatric
evidence
is
to
ask
questions
of
the
defendant.
that's
how
you
do
it.
that's
the
parallel
to
whatever
ballistics
tests
they
do
on
the
--
on
the
firearm.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
katyal.
general
schmidt,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
happens
if
the
defendant
is
going
through
this
examination,
they
ask
him
this,
he
tells
them
this,
that,
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
ask
him
a
question,
he
said,
i'd
rather
not
answer
that.
i
mean,
is
he
allowed
--
allowed
to
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why?
because
it
might
incriminate
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
little
bit
different.
i
understand
terminate,
then
they'd
say,
well,
look,
you
don't
get
to
put
your
expert
in.
but
what
if
it's
just,
you
know,
particular
questions?
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
don't
forget
it.
why
don't
you
try
a
quick
response.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
