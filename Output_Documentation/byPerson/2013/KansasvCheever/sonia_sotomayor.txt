justice

can

go
back
to

line

justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
question
that
some
of
my
colleagues
have
focused
on.
if
we're
to
say
that
this
was
not
compelled
speech,
presumably
there'd
be
no
reason
the
government
couldn't
use
this
report,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
put
his
or
her
mental
state
at
issue,
because
if
it's
not
compelled,
you
could
use
it
as
affirmative
evidence,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
seems
a
somewhat--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
i
may
finish?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
that
i'm
troubled
by
that
holding,
then
what's
the
line
we
draw
with
respect
to
the
question
justice
kennedy
asked
you
as
to
when
it
is
permissible.
you're
saying
let's
just
rule
on
the
base.
when
the
defendant
puts
on
an
expert,
we
can
rebut
with
an
expert.
but
the
broader
question
of
if
he
puts
his
mental
state
at
issue
without
an
expert,
could
you
do
it?
could
you
still
put
on
his
examination?
i'm
not
sure
you've
really
answered
that
question--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
is
how
broadly
do
we
hold.
there's
a
waiver
whenever
you
put
in
your
mental
state
at
issue
or
is
it
a
waiver
only
when
you
use
an
expert
and
then
the
government
is
free
to
respond
with
a
compelled
statement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i'm
presuming
that
if
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
says
something
completely
contrary
to
what
he
tells
a
government
psychiatrist,
that
you
would
rely
on
the
brown
line
of
cases,
that
you
could
cross-examine
him
on
the
contrary
statement
to
the
psychiatrist.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
would
be
a
different
issue.
i'm
just
talking
about
whatever
statements
he
made.
but
don't
--
the
light
is
on.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
katyal,
assuming
the
incredulity
of
my
colleagues
continues
with
your
argument,
which
way
would
you
rather
lose?
[laughter]
on
a
waiver
theory
or
on
a
lack
of
compulsion
theory?
and
pick
one
and
tell
us
the
reason
why
that's
preferable
to
the
other.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
scope
issues.
that's
not
right
issues.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
why
we
shouldn't
follow
the
simmons
analogy
because,
as
i
understand
it,
we
haven't
ruled
on
the
last
question
of
whether
you
can
use
the
compelled
statements
as
impeachment.
but
if
we
assume
that
to
be
the
case,
most
circuits
who
have
addressed
the
issue,
and
i
think
it
may
be
all
of
them,
have
said
you
can
because
there's
a
waiver
of
your
fourth
amendment
right
when
you
take
the
stand
to
impeachment.
why
couldn't
we
follow
a
similar
reasoning
here,
which
is,
you're
compelled
to
--
i'm
sorry.
forget
it.
i
can
answer
my
own
question.
