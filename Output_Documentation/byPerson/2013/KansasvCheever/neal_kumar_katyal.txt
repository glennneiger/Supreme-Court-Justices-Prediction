mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
is
trying
to
use
scott
cheever's
words
to
execute
him.
that's
wrong
for
many
reasons,
but
the
simplest
one
is
that
whatever
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
waiver
may
be
in
this
case,
the
prosecution
here
exceeded
it.
scott
cheever's
words
were
uttered
in
the
context
of
an
uncounseled,
un-mirandized,
5-1/2
hour
jail
exam
that
the
state
made
him
undergo
as
the
price
for
putting
on
his
voluntary
intoxication
defense.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
your
honor,
we
think
that
that's
partially
right.
that
is,
our
argument
ultimately
does
invalidate
a
small
part
of
the
application
of
12.2(d),
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
court
should
avoid
that
constitutional
question
by
focusing
on
the
scope
question,
which
is
a
federal
fifth
amendment
question,
justice
scalia,
not
one
of
kansas
law.
and
if
i
could
walk
you
through
our
12.2
thinking.
12.2(d)
excludes
testimony
from
the
defense
expert,
or
it
may.
it's
permissive.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
a
trial
judge,
a
federal
judge,
excluded
evidence
that
the
defendant
wanted
to
put
on
because
he
didn't
--
because
he
didn't
submit
to
the
exam
or
the
like,
we
do
think
that
that
application
would
be
violated.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
your
honor,
it's
the
clash
between
--
it's
just
like
simmons.
it's
the
clash
between
two
different
constitutional
rights,
the
right
to
put
on
an
effective
defense
on
the
one
hand
or
the
right
that
is
--
the
right
of
self-incrimination
on
the
other.
and
it's
that
choice,
your
honor,
which
we
find
makes
the
compulsion
necessary
--
compulsion--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--quite.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
quite
right.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
quite
right,
your
honor.
but
when
a
state
like
kansas
offers
the
voluntary
intoxication
defense,
makes
it
part
of
the
state's
burden
to
prove
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
then
conditions
that
by
saying,
well,
if
you
put
that
evidence
on,
you
then
have
to
pay
the
price,
submit
to
a
5-1/2
hour,
uncounseled,
un-mirandized
investigation
that
goes
far
beyond
what
the
voluntary
intoxication
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no.
we
--
your
honor,
we
agree
and
we
think
that
this
case
obviously--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
agree
on
the
legal
standard.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
that's
what
we
think
you
should
say,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
precisely
right,
justice
breyer.
both
sides
are
agreeing
on
the
legal
standard.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
that
is
--
that
is
ultimately
what
we
think
--
and
it
avoids
the
constitutional
question
by
doing
that.
and
this
case
has
never
--
this
court
has
never
squarely
held
that
the
legal
proposition
that
both
sides
are
now
in
agreement
on--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
honor,
i
think
you
can
vacate
the
decision
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
and
remand
for
them
to
look
at
whether
or
not--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
that
it
--
that
it
reached
to
ultimately
decide
this
constitutional
question
on
12.2
that
it
didn't
have
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
honor,
i
certainly
think
that's
available
to
you,
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
case,
in
which
there
is
such
an
interrelationship
between
the
scope
issue
and
the
ultimate
merits
question
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
justice
scalia,
if
i
could
just
try
--
try
--
if
you
look
at
even
kansas'
opening
brief
at
page
9,
at
page
12,
at
page
40,
at
page
42,
it's
all
about
the
scope
question.
that's
their
opening
brief.
and
so
we
think
that
they
are
integrally
bound
up.
be
that
as
it
may,
it
might
not--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
quite
right.
our
broadest
position,
and
we
think
the
one
that
--
that
also
disposes
of
this
case,
is
the
idea,
as
justice
scalia
was
saying
to
my
colleague
on
the
other
side,
that
what's
at
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
the
state
--
whether
or
not
the
state
can
follow
where
the
defense
has
led,
but
rather
how
can
they
follow.
and
here,
the
state
is
doing
something
that
there
is
literally
--
that
this
court
has
never
squarely
authorized.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that's
mostly
right.
i'd
like
to
be
a
little
bit
--
break
down
the
rule
a
little
bit.
12.2(d)
has
the
provision
which
says
that
if
you
--
that
the
price
of
not
submitting
to
the
exam
is
the
exclusion
of
the
defense
expert.
so
we
think
that
--
it's
a
permissive
rule,
but
if
it's
applied
we
think
that's
unconstitutional.
there
are
other
points
of
12.2
which
don't
raise--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
think
that's
what
12.2(c)(4)
says.
rather,
what
12.2(c)(4)
says
is
that
--
that
the
state
can
introduce
expert
testimony
on
an
issue
regarding
mental
condition
on
which
the
defendant
has
introduced
evidence.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
whether
or
not
that's
talking
about
a
buchanan
situation,
one
in
which
the
defense
has
requested
the
exam
or
not.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
exactly.
and
so
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
it's
used
to
--
to
introduce,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
evidence
that
--
that
the
defendant's
own
words
against
him,
yes,
we
think
that
12.2
raises
a
deep
constitutional
question,
something
which
this
court
has
never--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
we
agree
with
the
first
75
percent
of
that;
that
is,
that
certainly
it's
the
case
that
when
the
defendant
takes
the
stand,
they
are
subject
to
cross-examination.
cheever
took
the
stand.
he
is
subject
to
cross-examination.
cheever's
expert
takes
the
stand,
evans.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
state
can
go
further
and
force
someone
to
submit
to
a
mental
health
evaluation
and
use
that
against
them.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
it--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that's
how
it
plays
out.
so
for
example,
if
this
were
an
accounting
case,
a
criminal
accounting
case,
and
the
defendant
had
talked
to
--
the
ceo
of
the
company
had
talked
to
an
accounting
expert,
walked
them
through
all
the
books
and
so
on
and
said,
here's
what
happened,
and
so
on,
and
the
expert
took
the
stand,
i
don't
think
the
state
could
then
force
their
expert
to
talk
to
the
defendant
and
have
that
evidence
introduced
against
the
defendant.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
oh,
i
think
that
cuts
the
other
way.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and,
justice
scalia,
that
precisely
cuts
the
other
way.
this
court
in
couch
v.
united
states
said
that's
the
heart
of
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
about,
the
intrusion
into
a
defendant's
mind.
and
here,
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
what
does
the
work
in
your
ballistics
example
is
precisely
that
it
isn't
the
defendant's
own
words;
it's
something
else,
and
so
it's
wholly
outside
of
the
fifth
amendment.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
this
circumstance
is
scott
cheever's
own
words
to
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes.
but
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
imposes
a
different
value
judgment
of
our
founders
based
on
this
type
of
situation
in
which
you
are
peering
into
the
defendant's
mind.
i
think
that's
what
the
language
in
couch
v.
united
states
is
all
about,
that
there
is
a
difference
between--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--exactly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
would
have
a
constitutional
objection.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
exactly
what
i
was
saying
to
justice
ginsburg,
that
this
choice,
a
simons-like
choice
was
forced
upon
the
defendant.
he
could
either
put
on
his
defense--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
of
course,
the
state
can
cross-examine
our
--
our
psychiatrist
and
every
word--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
--
we
do
ultimately
disagree,
your
honor,
with
the
bottom-line
holding
in
the
byers
case
that
--
that
yourself
and
justice
scalia
was
on.
we
think
that
that
reasoning,
the
way
that
the
court
got
there
was
to
say
that
there
was
a
policy-based
reason
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
allowed
this.
it
wasn't
waiver,
which
you've
been
hearing
about.
it
was
a
policy-based
reason.
and
frankly,
i
think
that
ultimately,
this
is
a
--
the
governments'
argument,
both
governments',
is
an
argument
in
search
of
a
theory.
we've
heard
a
bunch
of
different
ones.
we've
heard
the
byers
one
about
policy.
we've
heard
justice
alito's
question--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
we
think
that
byers
ultimately,
the
language,
the
way
it
got
there
was
purely
policy.
and
we
think
that
this
court
has,
in
the
30
years
since
byers,
really
changed
to
the
game
on
the
use
of
policy-based
reasoning
when
it
comes
to
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
quite
think
that's
right.
the
text
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
that
a
defendant
can't
be,
quote,
“
compelled
”
to
be
a
witness.
and
once
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
acts
as
a
witness,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
is
behavior
inconsistent
as
berghuis
v.
thompson
suggests,
with
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
when
a
defendant
is
forced
to
undergo
a
psychological
examination
as
the
price
for
putting
on
his
mental
state
defense.
at
least
--
at
least
when
it's
an
element
to
the
defense.
we
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into,
as
our
brief
explains,
affirmative
defenses
like
the
federal
defense--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it's
--
it's
several
cases,
but
i
think
simmons
is
the
best
case.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
seven
justices--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--oh,
disagree
entirely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
government
can
put
experts
on,
psychiatric
experts,
but
they
can't
put
on--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that's
the
problem,
absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
that
is
wholly
foreign--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i'm
saying
that
--
that
in
a
circumstance
--
that
either
way,
if
it's
the
price
for
putting
on
the
defense,
then
yes,
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--no.
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
not
our
argument.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
prosecution
can
still
put
on
an
expert
witness,
they
just
can't--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
imaginary
psychiatrist
can't
be
put
on
under
our
system
and
indeed
under
kansas's
own
system,
justice
breyer.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
it
does.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
this
court
has
never
once
accepted
the
idea
that
a
--
that
the
government
can
force
someone
to
talk
to
your
psychiatrist
b
and
introduce
his
own
words
against
him.
that's
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
about.
and
i
understand,
sure,
the
government
isn't
going
to
have
the
evidence
that
it
wants.
it's
going
to
be
the
price
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
what
it--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
it's
--
it's
simply
a
rule
of
evidence
that
doesn't
condition
one
right
against
the
other,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
it
would
go
back
to
your
earlier
question--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
breyer.
the
idea
that
the
government
can
force
someone
to
undergo
a
mental
--
or,
excuse
me,
a
physical
evaluation
and
maybe
extract
stuff
from
their
body
as
the
price
for
putting
on
a
defense,
yeah,
i
think
that
raises
some
fifth
amendment
questions--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
certainly
i
think
lack
of
compulsion
is
not
something
that
really
is
being
advanced
by
the
government
in
this
case.
even
their
opening
lines
of
their
oral
argument
are
focusing
on
waiver,
not
that.
and
i
think
it
would
raise
any
number
of
concerns
like
the
ones
you
suggested
to
go
on
a
compulsion
theory,
that
it
would
allow
introduction
of
evidence
even
if
the
defendant
hasn't
led
in
that
direction.
but
i
would
like
to
try
and
take
another
shot
at
persuading
the
colleagues--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
quite
think
that
the
cross-examination
cases
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
leads
to
the
same
way
and
gets
you
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
someone
testifies
by
--
if
an
expert
testifies
using
the
defendant's
own
words,
that
that
opens
the
door
to
the
prosecution
doing
so.
there
is
something
unique
about
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
idea
that
the
government
can
peer
into
someone's
mind
and
extract
information
out
of
them
in
an
uncounseled,
un-mirandized
5-1/2
hour
session
and
have
that
used
against
them
at
trial.
and
the
price
that
cheever
paid
here
was
an
extraordinary
one.
he
put
on
a
defense
that
has
been
a
defense
for
hundreds
of
years.
the
idea
of
voluntary
intoxication.
and
he
was
told
the
cost
of
doing
that
was
that
this
exam
took
place
and
all
of
this
evidence
ranging
about
outlaws
and
so
on
was
introduced--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
he
certainly
testified
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
what
the
defense
expert
testified
to,
voluntary
incapacitation
under
methamphetamine
and
certainly
the
prosecution
expert
did
that
as
well,
but
then
the
prosecution
expert
went
a
lot
further
to
talk
about
his
--
it's
a
suggested
anti-social
personality
disorder,
to
suggest
outlaws
and
the
outlaws
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
state
first
in
the
context
of
direct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
but
i
think
it
does
bear
on
when
you
think
about
whether
the
simmons
analogy
makes
sense
whether
or
not
forcing
a
defendant
as
the
price
of
the
defense
to
open
the
door
to
all
of
this
evidence
being
introduced
against
him,
that
is
not
really
a
choice
at
all.
that
is
ultimately--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i'm
not
sure
that
they
would
favor
it
or
not.
our
argument
is
simply
that
when
a
state
such
as
kansas
recognizes
the
voluntary
intoxication
defense
and
doesn't
have
all
these
witness
rules,
that
cheever
is
entitled
to
put
on
that
effective
defense
and
not
have
that
right
to
flash
against
his
fifth
amendment
right.
and,
indeed,
the
fact
that
the
state
has
all
sorts
of
options
available
to
it
like
expert
--
like
expert
evidentiary
rules
or
even
abolishing
the
involuntary
intoxication
defense
all
together
is
the
true
answer
to
the
policy
concerns.
not
trying
to
jigger
into
the
fifth
amendment,
somehow
some
exception
that
allows
for
psychiatric
exams
by
criminal
defendants.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
may
be.
it
may
not
be.
that's
something
the
legislature
would
hammer
out,
but
i
think
that's
where
the
policy
objection--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
think
that
if
the
court
follows
our
rule
which
suggests
that
you
can't
put
the
defendant
to
this
choice,
the
state
has
the
option
of
modifying
the
voluntary
intoxication
defense
possibly
making
it
an
affirmative
defense
or
putting
restrictions
on
experts,
any
number
of
things
that
may
be
possible
in
that
circumstance
or
the
legislative
process
not
through
some
fifth
amendment
interpretation
of
this
court
to
try
and
deal
with
a
policy
concern.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
your
honor,
our
brief
at
page
36
points
out
that
under
kansas
law
it's
an
element
of
the
offense,
they
carry
the
burden
of
proof.
in
the
sixth
circuit
decision
in
united
states
versus
davis,
i
think,
explains
that
in
a
circumstance
like
this,
like
involuntary
intoxication,
the
defendant
is
not
interjecting
some
new
issue
into
the
trial.
the
defendant
is
simply
rebutting
the
premeditation
argument
which
is
their
burden
to
prove.
and
if
you
accept
their
argument
here,
you're
essentially
saying
that
the
defendant's
own
words
can
be
used
by
the
state
to
shoulder
the
load
against
him.
and
that
is
something
foreign
to
the
fifth
amendment.
it
may
be
something
you
want
to
do
for
policy
reasons.
i
understand
that.
but
it
is
not
something
this
court
has
ever
accepted.
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
