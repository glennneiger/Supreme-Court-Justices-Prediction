general
--
general--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
he
--
the
defendant
would
have
to
introduce
the
issue
of
his
mental
state
either
by
his
own
testimony
or
an
expert,
but
there's
an
oddity
about
this
case.
do
i
understand
correctly,
general
schmidt,
that
if
there
had
never
been
a
federal
proceeding,
if
this
case
had
proceeded
from
start
to
finish
in
the
kansas
courts,
there
would
have
been
no
welner
evidence,
there
would
have
been
no
prosecution
expert,
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
allowed
under
kansas's
own
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
--
this
case
was
voluntary
intoxication
and
--
and
under
kansas
procedure,
the
--
the
prosecution
could
not
have
called
a
witness
absent
insanity
or
a
mental
disease;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
issue
is
whether
the
expert,
the
government's
expert,
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
direct,
the
experts
for
the
defendant.
that's
an
open
--
that
would
be
an
open
issue
because
i
think
rule
--
the
federal
rule
12.2
is
very
clear
that
the
rebuttal
testimony
cannot
exceed
the
scope
of
the
defense
expert's
testimony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
an
academic
question
in
this
case?
after
all,
this
expert
for
the
government
came
in
when
the
case
was
in
the
federal
system.
the
federal
system
has
a
rule
that
when
the
defense
puts
on
an
expert,
the
government
can
counter
it.
so
the
--
the
limit
would
be
--
i
mean,
kansas
doesn't
provide
for
this?
the
federal
rules
provide
for
it
in
a
very
limited
way.
so
to
talk
about
using
it
beyond
the
scope
of
the
federal
rule
seems
to
me
not
the
case
that's
before
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
the
government
can
answer
in
--
in
a
like
manner
as
the
defendant?
the
defendant
opens
the
door
by
experts,
then
the
government
can
call
experts.
that
is
not
to
say
that
a
defendant
simply
offers
his
own
testimony,
the
government
can
do
something
that
--
that
the
defense
has
not
opened
the
door
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
katyal,
if
this
had
played
out
entirely
in
the
federal
court,
the
examination
of
the
defendant
was
pursuant
to
federal
rule
12.2.
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
rule
12.2
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
i
mean,
the
mental
examination
was
ordered
in
the
federal
court
after
the
defendant
said:
i
am
going
to
put
on
a
couple
of
witnesses,
expert
witnesses,
to
testify
to
my
mental
state.
rule
12.2
says
when
a
defendant
does
that
then
the
government
has
the
right
to
have
the
defendant
examined
by
its
expert.
so
the
broad
argument
that
you're
making
seems
to
lead
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
rule
12.2
is
unconstitutional.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
scope
question
wasn't
decided
by
the
kansas
court,
and
they
wouldn't
get
to
it
unless
they
held
that,
yes,
you
can
have
this
rebuttal
testimony.
then
the
next
question
is,
if
you
can
have
it,
how
far
it
can
go?
but
the
anterior
question,
can
you
have
it
at
all,
is
the
question
the
kansas
supreme
court
answered
no,
you
cannot
have
it.
and
we
can't
send
it
back
to
them
without
--
i
mean
if
--
if
you
can't
have
it
at
all,
then
it's
irrelevant
that
the
scope
was
too
broad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
katyal,
would
you
--
you
said,
in
answer
to
my
question,
that
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
12.2
violates
the
fifth
amendment
in
small
part.
can
you
be
explicit?
the
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
says
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
introduce
evidence
concerning
his
mental
state,
then
the
government
has
a
right
to
have
the
government's
expert
examine
the
defendant
and
rebut
what
the
defendant's
experts
say.
that's
what
the
rule
is.
and
then
it
says
you
can't
go
beyond
the
scope
of
that
issue,
of
the
mental
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think
it's
unconstitutional
to
say
to
the
defendant,
you
have
a
choice;
if
you
introduce
this
testimony,
then
the
government
can
follow
where
you
have
led;
if
you
don't
introduce
the
testimony,
then
of
course
the
government
has
nothing
to
rebut.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
"on
which
the
defendant
has
introduced
evidence.
"
"the
evidence
is
the
defendant's
expert.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
katyal,
if
that's
your
position,
then
you
must
disagree
with
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
which
was
already
mentioned,
united
states
against
byers,
which
took
the
position
that
where
the
defendant
leads,
the
government
may
follow.
for
the
very
reason
that
the
defense
expert
has
access
to
the
defendant,
you
can't
disarm
the
government
by
saying,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
have
a
counter-expert.
all
you
can
do
is
cross-examine
the
defendant's
expert.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
know
that
it
was
policy.
i
thought
it
was
--
it
was
saying
it
is
just
like
the
defendant
gets
on
the
stand;
he's
subject
to
cross-examination.
the
defendant
puts
on
experts;
the
government
must
be
treated
equally,
must
be
able
to
put
on
its
own
experts.
and
as
far
as
waiver,
that's
a
fiction,
isn't
it?
the
defendant
could
say
100
times
i'm
going
to
testify,
but
i'm
not
waiving
my
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
wouldn't
matter
if
he
said
that
100
times.
he
will
be
exposed
to
cross-examination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
katyal,
you
have
conceded,
i
think,
in
response
to
justice
alito's
question
that
the
rules
could
be
changed
to
say,
defendant,
you
cannot
put
on
these
experts.
so
how
does
that
maybe
help
defendants
who
want
to
put
on
a
defense
of
mental
state?
you
can't
put
it
on
unless
the
government
can
put
it
on.
that's
the
current
rule,
but
you're
saying
the
response
to
it
can
be
this
evidence
is
shut
out
entirely.
the
government
--
the
government
will
have
nothing
to
answer
if
the
defendant
doesn't
put
on
experts.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
would
be
a
rule
that
defense
counsel
would
put
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
need
to
hammer
out?
you
said
that
the
rule
now
is
no
good
because
it
allows
government
psychiatrists
to
have
access
to
the
defendant,
compelled
access.
that
rule
is
no
good,
but
the
alternative
of
not
allowing
this
evidence
at
all,
what
is
there
to
hammer
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
really
a
huge
difference
between
mental
state
as
an
element
of
the
defense
and
mental
state
as
an
affirmative
defense.
i
mean,
in
reality,
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
mental
state
argument
of
the
defendant
function
as
an
affirmative
defense
to
premeditated
murder?
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
mental
state,
but
it,
it
operates
as
far
as
a
defendant
is
concerned
if
the
defendant
is
able
to
show
this
voluntary
intoxication,
that
would
be
a
defense
to
premeditated
murder.
