justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
just
--
i
have
the
same
concern
as
justice
scalia.
i
mean,
that
makes
your
case
easier,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
defendant
puts
his
mental
capacity
in
issue
and
then
testifies
himself,
but
with
no
expert,
the
state
can
still
call
its
own
expert
so
far
as
the
--
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned.
there
might
be
some
kansas
rules
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
could
just
make
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
necessary
to
make
our
decision
depend
on
whether
or
not
another
expert
has
been
called.
that
makes
your
case
easier.
and
sometimes
when
we
write
opinions,
we
take
the
easiest
route.
but
i
take
it
under
your
theory,
even
if
the
defendant
had
not
called
his
own
expert,
we
would
still
have
the
same
issue
before
the
court
and
you
would
take
the
position
that
a
prosecution
expert
can
testify.
now,
whether
or
not
he
can
use
the
previous
statement,
that's
--
that's
the
second
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
why
doesn't
it
settle
the
matter
as
a
--
as
you
understand
the
case
that's
being
presented
--
as
a
constitutional
matter?
sure.
kansas
may
have
some
rules.
maybe
the
judges
say
i'm
not
going
to
hear
this,
this
--
this
is
a
state
rule.
but
insofar
as
the
--
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned,
why
doesn't
that
settle
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
going
--
we're
going
right
back
--
the
defense
expert
here
peered
into
his
mind.
it's
set
out
in
the
appendix.
it's
confusing
because
there's
a
doctor
evidence
and
also
an
attorney
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
--
the
expert
is
dr.
evans.
he
peers
into
the
defendant's
mind.
now,
are
--
is
this
case
any
different
and
any
better
for
you
because
it
happened
in
state
court?
suppose
everything
here
happened
in
the
federal
court;
would
you
have
a
constitutional
objection?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
constitutional
objection
would
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
view
--
in
your
view,
the
defendant
can
be
interviewed
by
his
own
psychiatrist,
but
not
by
a
prosecution
psychiatrist.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
the
--
can
you
give
me
the
black
letter
formulation
that
you
are
asking
this
court
to
adopt?
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment
when?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
something
of
an
overstatement
because
he
also
had
the
psychiatrist
who
testified
that
in
his
expert
opinion
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
mental
state
and
he
--
and
he
prefaced
that
by
indicating
how
many
people
he
had
examined
that
had
used
meth
and
there
was
neurotoxicity,
so
this
defense
expert
did
testify
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
think
you
quite
overstate
when
you
say
the
fact
the
defendant
testified.
