justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
general
schmidt,
am
i
wrong
to
think
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
was
compulsion
at
the
time
when
the
statement
was
made
to
the
--
the
court-ordered
expert?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
the
issue.
it's
not
--
it
wouldn't
be
a
question
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
at
the
time
when
the
statements
were
later
introduced
in
the
kansas
trial.
isn't
it
very
well
settled
in
this
court's
precedents
that
the
introduction
of
statements
obtained
--
that
the
introduction
of
statements
at
a
trial
is
not
--
does
not
implicate
the
fifth
amendment
privilege?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
the
issue,
as
i
see
it.
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
and
maybe
mr.
katyal
will.
that
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
unconstitutional
compulsion
at
the
time
when
the
statements
were
obtained.
but
i
thought
it
was
very
well
settled
that
if
there
--
there
wasn't
compulsion
at
that
time,
then
the
later
introduction
of
the
statements
into
the
--
into
evidence
at
the
trial
does
not
implicate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
happened
in
--
in
state
court
really
is
--
is
irrelevant
to
this.
this
is
--
everything
that
--
everything
important
here
was
done
under
rule
12.2
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
that's
--
and
that's
the
issue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--yes,
sure.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
the
question
here
whether
rule
12.2
is
constitutional?
everything
that
was
done
here
seems
to
me
to
have
been
done
in
compliance
with
rule
12.2
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
so
if
there's
--
insofar
as
the
taking
of
the
statement
is
concerned,
which
i'm
suggesting
is
the
issue
and
not
the
later
introduction
in
the
kansas
court.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
would
be
--
that's
not
a
--
that's
not
a
self-incrimination
question,
though,
isn't
it?
it's
a
due
process
question.
it's
an
unreasonable
limitation
on
the
defendant's
ability
to
put
on
a
defense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
there
wouldn't
be
at
that
point
--
suppose
the
federal
rules
simply
said
you
can't
have
an
expert
testify
about
mental
condition,
period.
that's
a
--
that
raises
a
due
process
issue,
and
maybe
there
would
be
a
serious
due
process
question
involved.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
up
to
that
point,
we're
not
quite
at
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
we
--
suppose
we
agree
with
you
and
the
response
is
the
adoption
of
a
new
federal
rule
of
evidence
or
a
state
rule
of
evidence
that
says
that
evidence
of
a
--
that
an
expert
who
testifies
for
the
defense
as
to
the
mental
--
the
insanity
or
mental
state
of
a
defendant
is
very
unreliable
if
there
has
not
been
an
opportunity
for
the
defendant
to
be
examined
by
another
expert
and
therefore
is
just
inadmissible.
you
can't
do
it
at
all.
would
there
be
a
constitutional
problem
with
that?
