ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
defendant
puts
his
mental
state
at
issue
through
the
testimony
of
an
expert
who's
examined
him,
the
state
may
rebut
that
testimony
with
its
own
expert
who
examined
the
defendant.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
allow
a
defendant
to
put
on
his
side
of
the
story
and
then
deprive
the
prosecution
of
any
meaningful
chance
to
respond.
and
we
think
the
close
analogy
here
is
the
situation
where
a
defendant
himself
takes
the
stand.
to
the
extent
that
the
question
--
the
court
has
questions
about
scope
of
the
government's
ability
to
respond,
we
think
that
those
are
answered,
like
the
general
said,
by
the
questions
about
when
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
reasonably
related
to
the
subject
matter
that
the
defense
put
on.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
that's
a
different
case.
the
court's
cases
--
estelle,
buchanan,
powell
--
have
addressed
an
expert-for-expert
situation.
and
the
specific
rationale
there
is
that
this
mental
health
opinion
testimony
is
different
in
that
you
really
can't
have
an
expert
give
an
opinion
without
examining
the
defendant.
if
we're
talking
about
the
defendant's
testimony,
you
know,
he's
not
qualified
to
be
an
expert.
he
can
give
factual
statements
about
what
happened
to
him
and
what
was
happening
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
but
he's
not
giving
an
expert
opinion.
so
to
us
it
does
seem
to
be
a
different
question
about
whether
it's
really
reasonable
to
have
an
expert
to
rebut
that
testimony.
the
court
just
doesn't
need
to
decide
that
question
in
this
case.
there's
also
a
second
question
that
the
general
alluded
to,
which
is
if
he
makes
factual
statements
during
his
mental
examination,
the
defendant,
and
then
also
gets
up
on
the
stand
at
trial,
testifies
and
says
something
contrary,
you
know,
whether
you
could
use
those
for
impeachment
purposes,
the
court
didn't
grant
that
question.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
i
think
this
goes
back
to
the
questions
that
justice
alito
started
asking
about,
which
have
to
do
with
where
there
is
compulsion
here,
if
at
all.
this
is
a
--
a
unique
situation
in
that
there
is
a
court-ordered
mental
exam,
but
it
only
happens
as
a
result
of
the
defendant's
choice
to
give
the
notice
of
putting
on
the
defense.
and
then
the
evidence
for
the
exam,
at
least
under
the
rules,
never
comes
in
until
he
puts
on
his
evidence
first.
it's
really
a
parity
principle
that
the
court
recognized
in
estelle
and
in
buchanan.
in
those
cases,
we
read
them
to
--
for
the
court
to
have
said
that
there
is
sufficient
compulsion
in
the
ordering
of
the
exam
to
raise
fifth
amendment
questions,
but
when
the
defendant
opens
the
door,
the
fifth
amendment
just
doesn't
give
him
any
right
to
--
to
stop
the
prosecution
from
responding.
but
if
the
court
wanted
to
find
that
there
was
no
compulsion
and
these
statements
could
be
used
for
any
purposes,
we
think
that
would
be
more
than
the
court
said
in
those
prior
cases.
but
this
is
a
different
situation
in
that
it
is
the
defendant's
choice
that
--
that
affects
whether
this
is
ever
going
to
come
in.
this
is
not
the
type
of
portash-compelled
testimony
where
you're
set
before
a
grand
jury
and
have
to
either
self-incriminate,
be
in
contempt
or
commit
perjury.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well
--
well,
if
the
question
is,
is
rule.12
constitutional,
we
think
the
answer
is
pretty
clearly
yes.
if
you
look
at
the
way
that
that
rule
has
evolved,
it's
evolved
in
response
to
this
court's
decisions
about
the
understanding
of
the
fifth
amendment,
that
there's
a
like-for-like
principle,
that
when
the
defendant
puts
this
in
issue,
that
the
state
can
respond
in
kind.
the
kansas
supreme
court
thought
that
there
was
a
separate
issue
because
of
the
specific
kansas
rules.
but
as
the
general
suggested,
you
know,
those
--
the
kansas
rules
may
be
a
--
there
may
be
a
kansas
problem
that
has
a
kansas
law
solution,
but
federal
constitutional
law
just
doesn't
depend
on
--
on
the
state
rules
of
evidence.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
a
factual
difference
from,
for
example,
buchanan
and
powell.
but
we
think
the
key
principle
is
the
one
that
comes
through
in
the
court's
cases
that
if
the
defendant
opens
the
door,
the
state
can
respond.
and
we
think
that
the
court
--
that
the
court
repeated
that
principle
numerous
times.
in
buchanan,
it
said
on
page
425
of
the
decision
defense
counsel
is
on
notice
that
if
you
open
the
door,
the
government
can
rebut.
and
it's
actually
interesting.
i
think
every
member
of
the
court
understood,
although
it
wasn't
clear
from
the
majority
opinion,
that
that
could
mean
a
separate
examination.
and
i
would
point
the
court
to
justice
marshall's
dissent,
footnote
5,
where
he
says,
"of
course,
you
could
have
your
own
separate
examination.
"
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
that
--
that
was
the
specific
holding
based
on
the
facts
of
that
case.
but
because
the
court--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--okay.
and
if
the
court
wants
to
say
that
there
is
sufficient
compulsion
here
in
the
ordering
of
the
mental
state
exam,
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
the
initial
choice
by
the
defendant,
we
would
say
the
defendant's
choice
at
trial
to
put
on
his
testimony
is
what
makes
this
--
this
evidence
available
to
the
government
to
use
in
rebuttal.
so,
it's
fine
that
buchanan
does
not
decide
the
exact
facts
of
this
case.
you
could
say
that
the
holding
does
not
decide
this
case,
but
we
think
it
comes
pretty
darn
close
because
the
court's
rationale
was
whether
the
defendant
opened
the
door.
it
said
again
and
again,
did
the
defendant
open
the
door,
and
if
he
does,
the
state
needs
this
evidence
to
have
any
effective
means
of
rebuttal.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
right.
the
rule
that
we've
--
we're
asking
this
court
to
adopt
is,
you
know,
the
same
one
that
we
think
was
at
least
hinted
at
in
the
decisions
in
--
in
estelle
v.
smith
and
in
buchanan,
which
is
when
the
defense
is
putting
on
an
expert
above
his
mental
state
that
is
testifying
to
an
opinion
based
on
an
examination,
that
the
state
also
can
have
its
own
expert
that
testifies
as
to
mental
state
based
on
an
examination.
we
think
this
is
a
unique
situation.
we
think
that's
all
the
court
needs
to
do
to
decide
this
case.
to
put
it
simply--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--sure.
the
implication
is
that
the
--
the
state
has
the
same
access
to
the
defendant
as
the
defense
expert
had,
because
the
state's
expert
is
unable
to
come
up
with
an
opinion
without
a
personal
examination
of
the
defendant.
this
was
explained
very
well
in
your
decision
for
the
plurality
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
byers,
which
is--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--we've
called
it
a
waiver
by
the
defendant's
conduct
for
two
reasons:
one,
that's
what
this
court
called
it
in
powell
when
it
was
describing
its
holding
in
buchanan;
two,
that's
what
this
court
has
called
it
--
and
i'd
point
you
to
page
15
of
the
gray
brief
--
in
the
cases
about
what
happens
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand,
that
in
the
act
of
taking
the
stand,
he
has
waived
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
but
you
don't
have
to
call
it
a
waiver.
the
point
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
extend
so
far
as
the
defendant
claims.
it
doesn't
allow
him
to
both
put
on
his
side
of
the
story
and
then
claim
that
the
government
can't
have
a
chance
for
any
meaningful
rebuttal.
so,
you
know,
we
--
we
really
don't
think
that
that
label
matters.
we
think
that
the
byers
d.c.
circuit
plurality,
we
think
that
the
pope
decision
that
was
well
before
this
court's
decision
in
estelle
by
then-judge
blackmun,
which
said,
you
know,
call
it
either
way;
you
know,
the
result
is
the
same,
which
is
that
this
evidence
can
come
in.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
right.
the
state
has
an
expert
who
examined
--
the
defense
has
an
expert
who
examined
the
defendant;
the
state
can
use
an
expert
who
examined
the
defendant.
it's
a
parity
principle
there.
it's
a
different
question
about
trying
to
rebut
or
impeach
the
defendant's
own
statements.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
again,
we
think
that's
the
second
question
presented
that
the
court
didn't
grant.
but
there
are
good
arguments
for
why
the
defendant,
once
he
opens
the
door,
should
not
be
able
to
slam
it
shut.
also,
we
think
this
court's
cases
like
ventris,
that
have
to
do
with
the
recent
cases
on
impeachment,
would
go
to
this.
now,
there's
a
question
about
whether
it's
a
difference
that
it's
the
defendant's
own
statements
as
opposed
to
an
expert's
opinion
based
on
his
statement.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
thank
you.
