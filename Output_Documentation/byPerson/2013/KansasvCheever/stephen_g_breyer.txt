justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
we
say
anything
about
that?
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
he
testified
to,
that
is,
the
government
expert
testified
to,
to
the
defendant
is
one
of
those
unusual
people
who
was
actually
exposed
to
a
variety
of
different
people
in
his
life.
he
had
people
who
were
criminal
types.
there
were
drug
users.
he
found
himself
identifying
and
looking
up
to
people
alternatively
described
as
bad
boys
or
outlaws,
looking
up
to
them,
being
impressed
and
awed
by
them,
and
in
certain
circumstances
wanting
to
outdo
them.
well,
that
doesn't
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
issue
that
the
defendant
put
into
the
--
wanted
to
put
in,
in
the
federal
court,
which
was
he
wanted
to
ask
about
his
--
about
his
--
his
words
exactly
are
“
a
defense
of
insanity
”,
which
can
be
interpreted
broadly,
namely
whether
you're
insane
or
not.
so
we
both
have
the
government
expert
saying
no,
he's
not
insane,
and
the
government
expert
going
on
to
give
an
explanation
of
why
he
shot
the
sheriff.
so
is
that
--
is
that,
in
your
opinion,
something
we
should
say
that's
a
serious
question,
whether
that
exceeds
it,
et
cetera?
what
should
we
say
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
your
words
would
be
because
they
have
introduced
what
we'd
say
as,
the
defense
has
introduced
an
argument,
that
even
if
it's
proper
for
the
introduction
of
the
government's
expert
witnesses
under
the
fifth
amendment,
it
still
cannot
be
beyond
--
go
beyond
what
is
--
what's
your
exact
word,
“
reasonably
”--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--reasonably
related
to
the
defense
of
insanity
that
the
defendant
himself
raised.
and
then
that
would
be
an
issue
for
the
kansas
court
to
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you'd
bring
up
arguments
why
this
is
okay
and
they
would
bring
up
arguments
why
it
isn't
reasonably
related,
and
kansas
would
decide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
--
you're
--
the
state
admits
that
all
that
they
could
put
on
was
information
from
the
psychiatrist
that
is
reasonably
related
to
the
defense
that
the
defendant
raised.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
we
both
agree--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
you
both
agree
that
the
test
is
“
reasonably
related
”.
so
we
could
simply
say
that.
they
both
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
we
send
it
back
to
the
kansas
court
and
say:
we
are
not
going
to
go
through
the
record
here
because
you
should
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
are
we
here?
everybody
agrees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
authority
for
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
you
know,
the
obvious,
it's
not
a
question
of
policy.
but
one
thing
the
fifth
amendment
prevents
you
from
being
a
witness
against
yourself,
you
didn't
take
the
stand.
so
what
you
did
was
introduced
three
psychiatrists
and
they
said,
this
man
was
totally
insane.
he
could
form
no
will
whatsoever.
totally
insane.
the
government
says,
we
have
seven
psychiatrists
who
would
like
to
examine
this
man
and
they'll
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion.
the
judge
says,
okay,
examine
him.
under
compulsory.
and
they
say
he
is
totally
sane.
and
they
each
have
reasons.
now,
you're
saying
in
that
case,
the
government
cannot
put
any
of
those
seven
on
the
stand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
but
they
--
they
can
base
their
testimony
on
an
examination
compelled
by
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that
--
that
puts
the
government
in
a
--
in
an
impossible
position.
the
defense
is
allowed
witnesses
who've
examined
the
defendant
and
--
oh,
you
mean
you're
only
limiting
it
to
the
case
where
the
defense
witnesses
don't
examine
the
defendant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
--
i'm
giving
you
a
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
psychiatrist
a,
hired
by
the
defense,
examines
the
witness.
he
says
he
is
totally
mad.
all
right?
that's
his
conclusion
based
on
the
examination.
psychiatrist
b,
who
works
for
the
government,
has
examined
the
witness
under
compulsion.
and
he's
done
it
under
the
authority
of
12.2,
because
the
defendant,
just
as
here,
made
a
12.2
motion
and
said
that
this
was
a
--
all
right,
just
like
here.
he
examines
him.
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
this
man
is
as
sane
as
--
whatever
the
most
sane
thing
is.
[laughter]
that's
his
conclusion.
you're
saying
the
government
can
put
on
its
witnesses,
but
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
--
sorry,
the
defense
can
put
on
its
witness,
but
the
--
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
defendant
from
putting
on
its
own
witness.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
means
it's
something
--
i
can't
imagine
how
the
fifth
amendment
can
say
that.
but
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
they
put
on
my
witness,
my
imaginary
psychiatrist
a.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be.
but
does
the
federal
constitution
--
it's
my
example.
it's
my
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
we
do
with
this?
the
defense
says,
my
defense
will
consist
of
the
fact
demonstrated
by
an
expert
that
my
heart
is
too
weak
to
have
made
it
up
the
stairs.
all
right.
and
i
have
mister
--
dr.
smith
who
has
examined
my
heart
and
he
will
testify
it's
impossible
i
could
have
been
on
the
third
floor.
i
would
have
been
dead.
so
the
government
says:
we
would
like
to
have
you
examined
by
our
doctor,
dr.
b,
who
we
believe
will
--
and
the
judge
orders
it.
so
now,
dr.
b
says,
his
heart
is
sound
as
an
ox
and
he
goes
to
it.
you're
saying
the
government
could
not
put
that
dr.
b
on
the
stand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
what
he's
saying
is
that,
look,
in
simmons,
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
problem
and
the
defendant
wants
to
testify
in
a
fourth
amendment
hearing.
and
if
he
does,
the
state
will
take
that
statement
and
use
it
at
the
trial.
so
because
of
the
reasons
--
i'd
say
the
policies
underlying
the
fourth
amendment,
the
court
says,
that's
wrong.
he
can
go
testify
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
then
they
can't
use
his
statement
later.
so
by
analogy
he
says,
it's
a
similar
situation.
he
says,
it's
the
policy
behind
the
fifth
amendment
that
says
if
you're
going
to
go
see
the
government
under
compulsion,
the
psychiatrist,
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
introduce
that
later.
i
mean,
i
think
that's,
in
my
looking
at
them,
because
i'm
trying
to
see
if
i
got
the
argument
basically
right,
which
is
what
i
wanted
to
find
out,
and
now
what's
the
response
to
that
particular
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
have
to
say
then
there's
difference
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
difference
would
be
what?
