justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
would
--
that
would
be
true,
the
last
would
be
true
even
if
the
defendant
had
not
sought
to
introduce
expert
evidence
of
his
own,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
state
can
call
its
own
expert.
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
can
compel
him
to
speak
to
its
expert--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
which
the
expert
can
testify,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
sort
of
coming
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
the
kansas
supreme
court
held
that
the
introduction
of
--
of
the
allegedly
compelled
testimony
given
to
the
--
to
the
psychiatrist
violated
the
federal
constitution.
but
why
didn't
--
why
didn't
the
kansas
supreme
court
simply
hold
that
there
was
no
--
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
to
obtain
that
rebuttal
evidence
or
to
introduce
it
since
this
was
a
case
of
voluntary
intoxication?
you
--
you
tell
me
that
kansas
does
not
allow
this
just
for
voluntary
intoxication
and
that
was
--
that
was
the
defense
he
was
raising,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they
did.
so
when
--
when
we
send
it
back,
is
it
still
open
to
them
to
decide
that
under
kansas
law
the
testimony
was
not
introducible?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is,
as
you
say,
a
question
of
--
of
kansas
law.
so
it
would
be
odd
for
us
to
resolve
that
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
the
question
of
whether
the
--
the
cross-examination
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
direct
and
whether
that
invalidated
it,
that
wouldn't
be
resolved
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
but
rather
under
kansas
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
wait.
i
mean,
all
the
state
--
i
think
it
oversimplifies
it
to
say
that
when
--
when
the
defendant
puts
it
at
issue,
the
government
can
respond.
yes,
the
government
--
the
government
can
respond
with
whatever
evidence
it
has,
but
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
the
government
can
respond.
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
can
compel
the
defendant
to
undergo
a
psychiatric
examination.
that's
--
that's
quite
a
different
issue
really
from
whether
the
government
can
respond.
of
course
it
can
respond.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
precisely,
it's
not
that
the
state
can
have
its
own
expert.
it's
that
the
state
can
compel
the
defendant
to
testify
to
an
expert,
can
compel
the
defendant
to
speak
to
a
psychiatrist.
that's
really
the
issue,
not
--
not
whether
the
government
can
respond.
of
course
it
can
respond.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
kansas
decided
the
constitutional
question,
and
we
can't
send
it
back
unless
we
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
so
you
say
we're
going
to
dodge
the
constitutional
question?
how
can
we?
i
think
it
has
been
decided
by
the
kansas
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
basis
can
we
vacate?
we
can't
vacate
a
decision
unless
there's
something
wrong
with
it.
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
error?
i
mean,
i
understand
it's
general
policy
you
don't
reach
a
constitutional
question
unless
you
have
to.
but
i've
never
heard
of
the
proposition
that
if
a
court
unnecessarily
reaches
a
constitutional
question
it
can
be
reversed,
that
we
can
send
it
back
and
say:
don't
reach
the
constitutional
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
kansas
decided
the
constitutional
question.
we
took
the
case
in
order
to
decide
that,
and
i
think
we
have
to
decide
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
saying
if
the
defendant
introduces
certain
evidence,
he
has
to
forfeit
some
of
his
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happens
every
time
the
defendant
chooses
to
testify.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
need
not
testify,
but
if
he
introduces
that
evidence
he
must
submit
to
cross-examination
and
has
to
incriminate
himself.
and
this
is,
it
seems
to
me,
quite
similar.
he
need
not
introduce
the
evidence
of
the
psychiatrist,
but
if
he
does
he
has
to
forfeit
his
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
talk
to
a
psychiatrist.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
it's
still
--
it's
still
the
same
--
the
same
correlative
system
playing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
defendant
does
one
thing,
he
has
to
accept
what
goes
along
with
it,
and
that
includes
waiving
or
forfeiting
his
--
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
getting
into
the
defendant's
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
the
psychiatrist
who
can
get
into
the
defendant's
mind
when
he
is
--
when
he
is
raising
a
mental
capacity
defense.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
as
the
price
for
putting
on
his
defense,
you
mean
as
the
price
for
introducing
the
testimony
of
a
psychological
expert.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
bet
you
the
prosecution
would
accept
your
alternative
in
a
heartbeat.
[laughter]
no
defendant
can
introduce
any
psychiatric
evidence.
that's
a
good
deal
for
the
prosecution.
