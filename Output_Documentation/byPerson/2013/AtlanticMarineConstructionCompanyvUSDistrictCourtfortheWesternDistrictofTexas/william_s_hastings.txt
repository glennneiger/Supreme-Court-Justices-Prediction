mr.
william
s.
hastings
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
forum
selection
clauses
have
been
frequently
used
in
contracts
of
all
types.
they
should
be
enforced
as
written
and
the
enforcement
of
a
contractual
forum
selection
clause
should
not
just
be
left
to
convenience
discretionary
balancing
tests.
rule
12(b)(3)
in
section
1406
of
the
united
states
code
provide
appropriate
and
effective
means
for
enforcing
a
contractual
forum
selection
clause.
the
language
of
those
provisions
is
written
broadly.
congress
used
words
like
“
wrong
”
and
the
rule
uses
the
word
“
improper
”,
which
have
plain
and
natural
meanings
that
are
broad
and
are
sufficient
to
authorize
district
courts
to
act
to
enforce
the
contractual
clause.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
your
honor,
the
cases
do
discuss
it
as
a
venue
provision.
one
example
would
be
this
court's
decision
in
stewart
addressed
a
forum
selection
clause
in
a
1404(a)
transfer
analysis,
which
is
clearly
a
venue
analysis.
in
addition
to
that,
with
the
2011
amendments
to
the
united
states
code,
congress
adopted
a
definition
of
venue.
it's
in
section
1390.
that
definition
says
the
place
of
litigation.
i'm
paraphrasing
it,
but
it's
--
it's
a
pretty
straightforward
definition.
the
legislative
history
of
section
201
of
that
act
acknowledges
that
the
definition
was
intended
to
make
venue
determinations
easier
and
to
make
it
clearer
that
parties
could
waive
or
adjust
these
types
of
provisions
even
by
contract.
the
words
“
by
contract
”.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
your
honor,
i
believe
the
correct
reading
of
that
language
is
what
the
second
circuit
has
said
in
the
trade
comment
decision
and
others
have
written
on
this,
that
stewart
and
--
and
the
text
read
by
that
footnote.
that's
footnote
8,
i
believe.
the
text
right
there
said,
"the
immediate
issue
is
how
we
address
1404(a).
"
and
the
way
the
majority
of
the
circuit
courts
have
read
it
is
the
issue
in
stewart,
this
procedural
issue
that
we're
here
on
today,
which
is
simply
not
presented
to
the
court.
and
so
the
court
could
very
easily
write
a
decision
that
acknowledges
stewart
still
controls
on
a
1404(a)
analysis,
but
acknowledged
that,
like
a
majority
of
the
circuits,
that
stewart
simply
did
not
have
to
address
this
problem.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
justice
alito,
i
respectfully
disagree.
and
here's
what
the
meaning
of
stewart
would
be,
as
--
as
we
understand
it.
first
of
all,
under
the
facts
of
stewart,
the
same
situation
would
arise,
of
course,
if
a
party
waived
their
proper
venue
objection.
that
may
be
a
narrow
line
of
cases,
but
that
would
still
apply
in
a
case
where
a
party
doesn't
assert
the
contract
at
first.
but
there's
another
place
where
stewart
would
still
apply:
when
a
case
is
filed
in
the
proper
jurisdiction.
here,
if
this
lawsuit
had
been
filed
in
virginia,
there
would
be
a
very
limited
place
for
exceptional
circumstances
for
a
court
to
look
at
a
1404(a)
analysis
and
determine
if
public
interest
required
something
other
than
the
contract
clause.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
in
exceptional
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
statutes,
particularly,
the
language
you
were
just
referring
to
about
“
might
have
been
brought
”,
needs
to
be
read
in
context
of
decisions
from
this
court.
in
van
dusen,
this
court
held
that
that
language
“
might
have
been
brought
”
was
a
term
of
art.
the
court
has
never
reached
that
conclusion
with
respect
to
wrong
or
improper.
and
in
van
dusen,
the
court
said
the
“
might
have
been
brought
”
language
was
a
term
of
art
referring
back
to
a
congressionally
chosen
venue
under
1391.
and
so
when
this
plays
out
under
1404(a),
the
court
--
if
the
case
is
in
the
proper
venue
and
we're
on
to
the
second
issue
of
1404(a),
the
proper
reading
of
the
language
would
allow
the
court
in
truly
and
exceptional
circumstances
to
follow
--
follow
the
language
of
the
statute
and
send
it
to
another
place
where
congress
said
the
case
could
have
been.
and,
again,
this
is
really
the
second
issue
in
the
case.
we
would
emphasize
that
it's
truly
exceptional
cases
where
parties
had
contracted
for
a
forum,
they've
truly
resolved
the
conveniences
among
the
parties
among
themselves.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
your
honor,
the
language
of
section
1391,
and
the
first
part,
i
believe
it's
1391(a)
where
it
has
the
language
of
“
shall
govern
in
federal
courts
”,
that's
really
no
different
than
what
this
court
said
in
stewart
of
federal
law
controls
venue
in
federal
courts.
but
the
issue
that
comes
up
is
that
venue,
venue
is
very
important.
venue,
even
before
the
current
statutes
were
written,
was
recognized
as
being
a
privilege
for
the
litigants.
they're
to
protect
the
defendants.
and
even
in
neirbo
in
the
1939,
so
almost
a
decade
before
the
--
some
of
the
current
statutes
were
written,
this
court
said
venue
was
subject
to
disposition
by
the
parties.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
your
honor,
if
there
was
no
objection
raised,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
your
honor,
in
response
to
that,
first
of
all,
the
venue
rights
have
always
been,
like
many
federal
rights,
waiverable
provisions.
and
when
a
contract--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--and,
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
word
“
improper
”,
improper
is
a
broad
term
and
it
has
a
broad
meaning.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
“
improper
”
for
just
a
second.
we
have
two
different
words,
“
improper
”
and
“
wrong
”.
but
“
improper
”
is
used
in
12(b)(3).
congress
didn't
--
or
--
and
the
courts
did
not
explain
what
that
applies.
in
practice,
that
word
is
used
for
many
different
contexts.
it's
used
to
enforce
forum
selection
clauses.
the
majority
of
the
circuit
courts
--
in
fact,
more
circuits
than
have
weighed
in
on
our
favor
use
that
language
to
enforce
foreign
clauses
and
clauses
requiring
state
court
forums.
it's
used
in
a
very
broad
context
in
order
to
enforce
people's
contract
rights.
it's
even
used
in
arbitration
context.
although
the
faa
gives
parties
the
right
to
move
under
the
faa,
many
parties
raise
their
complaints
under
the
12(b)(3)
because
of
the
procedural
impact
of
12(b)
motions,
allowing
parties
not
to
have
to
answer
complicated
federal
cases
and
get
to
proceed
to
arbitration
more
quickly.
giving
the
language
a
plain
and
natural
meaning
allows
the
courts
to,
essentially,
do
justice
and
allow
to
streamline
and
have
efficient
running
of
cases
and
to
enforce
parties'
rights
in
contracts.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
your
honor,
personal
jurisdiction
is
--
is
also
essentially
a
personal
right
of
the
defendant.
and
so
if
the
defendant
is
willing
to
consent
to
personal
jurisdiction,
as
often
happens
in
contracts--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--focusing
on
personal
jurisdiction,
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
yes.
because
parties
can
consent
and
contract
to
waive
the
personal
jurisdiction
objections.
and,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
has
been
recognized
by
many
of
the
circuit
courts.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
exactly,
your
honor.
just
like--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--and,
justice
scalia,
that
would
--
professor
sach's
brief
certainly
makes
that
argument.
i
would
begin
by
acknowledging
that
that
rule
would
be
far
better
than
leaving
this
to
discretionary
balancing
tests.
what
difference
it
would
make,
it
actually
would
be
very
favorable
to
my
client
because
this
case
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
we
have
concerns
about
that
rule.
that's
why
we
didn't
push
that
as
our
argument.
the
circuits
have
a
three-way
split.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
concerns
with
the
rule.
but
professor
sachs'
approach
does,
first
of
all,
start
off
with
a
strong
benefit
of
enforcing
contracts.
it's
just
not
as
effective
as
12(b)(3),
because
when
we
are
dealing
with
what's
really
a
venue
issue--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--your
honor,
under
the
current
statutes
i
believe
the
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
transfer
it
based
upon
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
your
honor,
many
--
many
courts
have
actually
read
1406
to
also
allow
for
addressing
personal
jurisdiction.
there's
a
circuit
split
on
that
issue.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
yes--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--justice
kagan,
the
first
circuit
has
been
using
the
12(b)(6)
approach
to
address
whether
the
case
is
in
the
right--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--outside
of
the
forum
selection
clause
context--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--and,
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
a
court
doing
it
outside
of
the
context
of
the
forum
selection
clause
issue,
as
the
first
circuit--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--justice
breyer,
i
do
have
an
answer
to
the
removal
issue.
and
the
answer
starts
in
section
1390(c).
and
in
1390(c),
congress
said--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--chief
justice
roberts,
it's
28
u.s.
code
1390(c).
mr.
william
s.
hastings
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
i
did
not
know
that
this
issue
was
going
to
come
up.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
with
respect
to
1390(c),
congress
said--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
congress
said
that
these
rules,
with
the
exception
of
the
transfer
rules,
do
not
apply
in
removal
cases.
congress
has
answered
the
question.
removal
procedure
is
governed
by
the
statutes
on
removal,
and
yes,
if
you
are
in
state
court,
there
is
one
court
you
can
remove
to.
this
rule
and
this
issue
doesn't
change
that.
but
if
you
--
if
this
case
had
been
filed
in
texas
state
court,
for
example,
and
was
removed
to
the
western
district,
1390(c)
still
says
that
the
transfer
rules
--
it
doesn't
say
1404(a);
it
says
the
transfer
rules,
which
would
also
pick
up
1406
--
could
still
apply
to
reallocate
the
venue
for
the
lawsuit
if
there
was
a
contract
clause
or
if
it
was--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--and,
justice
breyer,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
about
whether
you
can
get
to
the
texas
court.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
yes,
justice
breyer,
because--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--because
of
the
specific
federal
statutes
allowing
for
removal.
they
tell
specifically
where
the
removal
must
go.
and
so
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
court
would
have
to--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--that's
no--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
what
i'm
saying
if
the
state
district
--
if
the
parties
were
in
the
state
district
court
and
remove
it
to
the
federal
district
court,
under
the
statutes,
under
1390
--
well,
first
of
all,
that
was
--
that's
what
the
removal
statutes
require.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
1390(c),
which
say
the
transfer
rules
still
apply.
the
texas
district
court,
if
we
had
our
contract,
should
have
said:
now
that
you've
removed
this
to
federal
court,
we
must
transfer
this
case
to
virginia
because
the
transfer
rules
still
apply.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
your
honor,
under
that
circumstance,
if
it
was
a
contract
requiring
a
state
court
forum
--
i
think
that's
what
i
understand
the
question
to
be.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
okay.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
your
honor--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--and,
your
honor,
the
contract
would
not
prevent
the
removal,
but
once
the
case
was
removed
the
contract
would
control
where
the
case
--
where
the
case
would
be
allocated.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
justice
kennedy,
that's
an
excellent
question
because
the
courts,
when
they
usually
rule
on
forum
non
conveniens,
do
not
specify
that.
there's
not
a
federal--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--in
many
times,
yes.
but
a
lot
of
times
parties
do
go
ahead
and
cite
12(b)(3).
that's
often
done
by
parties
in
litigation.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
for
the
federal
courts,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
justice
alito,
we
do
think
there
is
some
tension
between
professor
sachs'
position
and
the
stewart
decision,
because
if
professor
sachs
is
correct
and
the
first
circuit's
correct,
there
really
would
be
no
room
for
a
1404
balancing
issue.
the
issue,
i
believe,
that
you
are
asking
about--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--justice
scalia,
if
the
contract
--
if
the
contract
elevated
this
to
an
issue
on
the
merits,
is
essentially
what
12(b)(6)
does,
then
it
becomes
an
issue
not
just
about
venue;
it
becomes
an
issue
about
merits.
and
so
a
venue
allocation
provision
wouldn't
change
the
fact
that
if
the
case
was
in
the
wrong
forum--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--he
wouldn't
have
to
move
under
12(b)(6),
but--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--but
there's
a
potential
problem
here,
and
this
is
one
of
the
practical
issues
with
professor
sachs'
issue
--
approach.
if
it's
an
issue
on
the
merits,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
raised
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
a
party
could
certainly
move
to
transfer
and
do
a
lot
of
other
things,
but
they
could
raise
that
issue
as
a
defense
on
the
merits
of
the
lawsuit
and
have
it
resolved
at
trial
after
the
entire
proceeding
had
proceeded
in
a
forum
other
than
where
the
contract
was
required.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
justice
ginsburg,
it
would
certainly
have
to
be
pleaded.
and
certainly
there
is
opportunity
--
you
know,
leave
is
freely
granted
in
cases
unless,
you
know,
other
circumstances
arise.
it's
possible
to
plead
it
down
the
line.
but
most
importantly,
it's
when
do
you
get
a
ruling
on
that
issue?
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
that's
our
position,
yes.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
your
honor,
the
way
this
would
work
out
is
if
--
focusing
on
the
1404(a)
issue,
the
real
issue
gets
down
to
where
does
the
lawsuit
need
to
be
filed,
what
rules
are
going
to
be
in
place,
and
if
a
party
can
just
file
in
texas
because
they
want
--
they
want
to
try
to
move
it
there
for
convenience,
they
can
just
file
in
texas,
what
they're
doing
is
they're
requiring
a
party
who
just
wants
to
live--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--justice
breyer,
first
of
all,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
under
this
case,
all
three
routes
should
have
lead
--
led
to
the
exact
same
conclusion.
that's
--
that
is
correct
under
this
case,
but
that
may
not
be
in
all
cases.
why
it
matters
is
that
parties
should
be
forced
to
honor
their
contracts.
and
so
if
a
party
honors
its
contract
and
there's
a
very
high
standard,
such
as
the
exceptional
circumstances
standard
for
receiving
a
transfer,
their
--
parties
who
are
following
their
contract,
it's
unlikely
you're
going
to
have
much
litigation
over
transfers.
whereas
if
a
party
can
say
i
can
try
my
shot
at
a
home
court
forum,
file
in
violation
of
the
contract
and
then
make
the
other
party
raise
this
issue
and
have
to
litigate
venue,
we're
going
to
have
a
tremendous
litigation
about
venue.
that's
the
problem.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and
that
would
be
a
problem
in
many
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
and,
justice
ginsburg,
that
--
that
points
out
that
if
the
court
were
to
not
just
strictly
enforce
the
contracts,
it
raises
many
new
issues
that
this
court
has
not
yet
had
to
address.
i's
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
just
a
few
brief
comments.
first,
the
parties
bargained
for
the
right
result,
and
they
bargained
and
reached
a
contract
that
should
settle
the
issue
of
conveniens
and
where
this
case
should
be
litigated.
stewart
has
an
important
observation
that
i
think
needs
to
be
emphasized.
even
under
a
1404(a)
analysis,
the
majority
in
stewart
said
the
bremen
is
still
instructive.
and
if
it's
instructive
on
anything,
on
any
rules
enforcing
a
contract,
it
should
be
instructive
at
this
level.
the
burden
should
be
on
the
party
trying
to
get
out
from
their
contract.
the
fifth
circuit
misallocated
the
burden.
the
burden
should
also
be
a
high
one.
it
really
should
require
exceptional
circumstances
or
perhaps
even
more,
and
it
should
not
be
a
case
where
a
party
can
avoid
its
contract
based
upon
inconveniences
that
were
foreseeable
at
the
time
of
contracting.
for
example,
the
fact
that
j-crew
hired
texans
to
work
on
its
project.
it
knew
what
the
project
was
about
and
what
it
would
need
to
do,
and
it
should
not
be
able
to
rely
upon
hiring
texans
to
change
the
deal
it
negotiated
with
my
client.
there
needs
to
be
a
clear
rule
that
allows
the
courts
to
hopefully
answer
the
questions
about
contracts
and
venue
so
we
all
can
stop
litigating
these
issues
and
know
the
right
answers
and
avoid
inundating
the
courts
with
motions
to
transfer
for
parties
wanting
to
renegotiate
contracts.
since
the
third
circuit
and
sixth
circuit
and
now
the
fifth
circuit
have
adopted
the
minority
position,
there
has
been
a
proliferation
of
litigation
when
a
contract
already
answered
the
question.
we
cited
many
cases
in
our
cert
petition
in
a
footnote,
and
i
know
there's
been
many
more
since
then.
and
those
are
the
ones
that
you
can
find
published.
that
doesn't
even
mention
the
ones
that
are
unpublished.
and
so
a
clear
rule
needs
to
be
in
place
to
avoid
these
problems.
justice
kagan,
you
raised
the
issue
of
forum
non
conveniens
as
perhaps
the
answer
as
to
what
would
happen
for
a
state
or
foreign
contract
clause.
i
wanted
to
briefly
touch
on
that
because
i
don't
believe
that's
the
right
answer.
the
bremen
looked
at
a
case
that
came
up
as
a
forum
non
conveniens
case
and
said,
we
are
not
going
to
use
the
forum
non
conveniens
test
for
enforcing
a
contract
requiring
litigation
in
an
international
forum.
they
resoundingly
rejected
the
forum
non
conveniens
approach,
and
i
believe
the
circuit
courts
have
read
bremen
as
rejecting
that
approach.
if
that
were
going
to
be
the
approach
to
answer
the
problem
created
by
the
fifth
circuit
for
foreign
and
state
courts,
what
we
would
end
up
with
is
a
new
common
law
approach,
whether
called
forum
non
conveniens
or
called
something
else,
that
looks
like
nothing
like
forum
non
conveniens
and
probably
a
whole
new
line
of
litigation
over
how
that's--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--and,
justice
kagan,
following
bremen,
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
that
what
essentially
bremen
is
doing
is
saying
forum
non
conveniens
is
not
the
right
approach,
and
so
instead
of
a
common
law
vehicle
to
answer
this
issue,
we
submit
that
the
right
answer
is
right
there
in
the
rules
already.
it's
12(b)(3)
is
the
best
answer.
section
1406
allows
the
court
also
to
address
this
issue.
honestly,
section
--
rule
12(b)(6)
in
professor
sach's
approach
is
much
better
than
leaving
these
issues
to
balancing
tests.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
hastings
justice
kagan,
the
only
way
i
know
how
to
answer
that
question
is
i
do
not
know
how
the
professor
sachs
approach
can
actually
be
reconciled
with
stewart.
there
is
significant
tensions
in
how
that
plays
out
as
an
issue
that
i
do
not
know
how
it
plays
out,
but
i
suspect
it
would
result
in
lots
of
litigation--
mr.
william
s.
hastings
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
we
are
asking
this
court
to
follow
the
majority
approach
on
this
issue.
