justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
the
stewart
case
to
which
you
just
referred,
the
court
said,
"the
parties
do
not
dispute
that
the
district
court
properly
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
for
improper
venue
under
1406(a).
"
because
respondent
apparently
does
business
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama,
which
was
not
the
jurisdiction
specified
in
the
forum
selection
clause.
so
what
--
if
we
were
to
write
an
opinion
in
your
favor,
what
would
you
suggest
we
say
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
true,
but
it
means
that
the
entire
discussion
in
stewart
is
beside
the
point.
the
court
wrote
a
decision
about
an
issue
that
really
never
should
arise
because
the
party
seeking
--
as
you
see
it,
the
party
seeking
to
enforce
the
forum
selection
clause
should
proceed
under
1406.
so
stewart
said,
well,
if
--
if
you
proceed
under
the
wrong
provision,
this
is
how
it
should
come
out.
it
makes
the
whole
decision
essentially
meaningless,
doesn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
that
would
--
i
don't
see
how
that
would
work.
you're
--
this
is
the
argument
you
made
in
your
reply
brief,
that
if
this
--
if
the
case
had
been
filed
in
the
jurisdiction
specified
in
the
forum
selection
clause,
that
court
could
nevertheless
proceed
under
1404(a)
and
transfer
it
back
to
the
western
district
of
texas,
for
example.
that's
--
that's
your
argument,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
exceptional
cases.
but
1404(a)
says
that
it
can
--
a
case
can
be
transferred
to
a
district
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
and
your
argument
under
1406
is
that
they
couldn't
be
brought
in
the
western
district
of
texas,
that's
a
place
where
there's
a
wrong
venue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
about
--
just
go
ahead.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
about
the
professor
sachs'
argument?
doesn't
it
lead
to
the
consequence
--
doesn't
it
show
that
--
wouldn't
it
mean
that
justice
scalia's
dissent
was
correct
in
stewart
and
the
majority
was
wrong
in
stewart?
because
if
this
is
--
if
this
is
contractual
--
suppose
ricoh
in
that
case
had
moved
--
had
adopted
--
had
taken
the
approach
that
professor
sachs
has
recommended
and
moved
for
summary
judgment,
12(b)(6)
or
summary
judgment;
that
would
be
a
contract
issue.
it
would
be
governed
by
alabama
law.
alabama
law
says
the
forum
selection
clause
is
no
good.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
interests
--
the
interests
of
justice
that
the
district
court
weighed
almost
all
boiled
down
to
the
interests
of
your
client.
the
inconvenience
of
witnesses.
well,
atlantic
marine,
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
their
witnesses,
they're
not
concerned
about
the
inconvenience
of
having
their
witnesses
go
to
--
to
norfolk.
but
your
witnesses
--
the
other
witnesses
are
your
witnesses.
so
that's
a
factor
that
goes
to
your
convenience.
compulsory
process
to
produce
witnesses,
same
thing.
so
what
were
the
public
interests
that
--
what
were
the
interests
that
were
weighed
here
that
are
not
the
interests
of
j.
crew?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
they're
not
your
witnesses,
then
they're
--
they're
atlantic
marine's
witnesses.
so
why
should
that
be
--
why
should
the
inconvenience
of
atlantic
marine's
witnesses
be
a
factor
that
weighs
against
atlantic
marine's
position
that
the
case
should
be
tried
in
norfolk?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
--
who
is
going
to
call
these
witnesses,
you
or
atlantic
marine?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
do,
so
they're
your
witnesses.
the
fact
that
they
don't
work
for
you
is
--
is
immaterial
here.
so
let's
say
they're
out
of
the
picture.
now,
what
else
--
what's
left?
what
other
public
interests
are
involved?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
--
texas
contract
law
is
so
arcane
that
the
judges
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
can't
figure
it
out?
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
oh,
okay.
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
1404
--
if
the
court--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
what
would
be
the
authority
for
dismissing
the
case
if
it
had
specified
the
state
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
1404
is
the
correct
procedural
route,
why
shouldn't
the
rule
be
something
like
this:
where
there
is
a
forum
selection
clause,
the
burden
is
on
--
the
burden
of
trying
to
establish
venue
in
some
other
jurisdiction
is
on
the
party
opposing
the
forum
selection
clause,
not
the
party
that's
invoking
the
forum
selection
clause.
and
the
only
factors
that
can
be
considered
against
the
forum
selection
clause
to
--
to
result
in
an
exceptional
case
where
that
wouldn't
be
honored
are
factors
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
convenience
of
the
--
of
the
party
that
doesn't
want
it
tried
in
--
in
the
selected
forum
or
with
the
likelihood
of
success
of
the
party
that
doesn't
want
it
tried
in
the
sel
--
in
the
jurisdiction
specified
in
the
forum
selection
clause.
so
in
your
case,
if
there
had
been
a
hurricane
that
wiped
out
the
courts
of
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
for
some
period
of
time
so
no
cases
could
be
tried,
or
there
was
an
incredible
back
load
of
cases
there
that
would
prevent
the
case
from
being
tried,
maybe
that
would
be
--
those
would
be
something
that
might
amount
to
an
exceptional
circumstance,
but
everything
else
is
off
the
board.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
should
that
--
why
should
that
be,
where
there's
a
forum
selection
clause?
