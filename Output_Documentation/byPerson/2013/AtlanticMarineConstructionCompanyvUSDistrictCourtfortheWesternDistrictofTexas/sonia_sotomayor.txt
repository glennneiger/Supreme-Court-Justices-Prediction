justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
law
travels
with
--
the
law
of
the
transferring
state
travels
to
the
transferred
state.
so
they've
undone
--
they're
taking
texas
law,
if
you
go
under
1404,
to
virginia.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
venue
selection
to
start
with.
that's
part
of
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
your
--
your
adversary
is
not
taking
that
discretion
away.
it's
saying
--
your
adversary
i
understand
is
conceding
that
virginia
has
the
ability
to
apply
1404
in
it's
judgment,
but
you
should
honor
the
contract.
i
have
one
fundamental
problem
which
is
slightly
different.
under
bremen
and
carnival,
if
the
forum
selected
was
arbitration
or
a
state
court,
then
the
court
has
no
1404
power.
it
must
transfer
to
those
venues.
if
we
accept
1404
as
applying,
then
we're
disfavoring
commercial
parties
from
picking
federal
courts
because
they're
going
to
have
to
accept
that
a
non-selected
venue
will
have
the
power
to
make
the
decision
whether
to
transfer
or
not.
that
seems
to
me
to
invite
--
there
may
be
people
who
think
that's
a
good
thing,
get
cases
out
of
the
federal
court
even
if
they
are
international
commercial
cases.
but
isn't
that
what
you
are
inviting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
use
12(b)(3),
not
1404.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
those
other
cases
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
use
12(b)(3).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
other
words,
that
issue
has
not
been
decided
by
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
that
by
filing
in
texas,
you're
not
going
to
arbitration?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
more
favorable
about
texas
other
than
your
convenience?
what's
more
favorable
about
arbitration
in
texas
other
than
your
convenience?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
only
thing.
it's
convenient
for
you
to
be
in
texas.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
would
be
--
the
only
people
collecting
that
$160,000
are
going
to
be
the
lawyers.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
took
a
contingency
case
in
a
contract
matter?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it's
under
12(b)(3)
then
stewart
stays,
and
it's
federal
law
that
controls
and
a
judge
decides,
right?
