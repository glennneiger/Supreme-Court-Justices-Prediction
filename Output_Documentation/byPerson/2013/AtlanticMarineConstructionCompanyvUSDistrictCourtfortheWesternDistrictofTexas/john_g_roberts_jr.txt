chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-929,
atlantic
marine
construction
company
vs.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas.
mr.
hastings.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
can
--
where
can
i
find
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
conveniently
set
forth
in
any
of
the
papers,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
fair
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
allensworth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
kind
of
a
big
thing,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
what
the
whole--
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
significant
factor.
and
--
and
the
problem,
the
difference,
all
things
don't
lead
to
the
same
place.
1404
says
to
the
district
court:
look
at
a
hodge-podge
of
things,
including
the
interest
of
justice,
and
--
and
figure
it
out
and,
you
know,
maybe
they
will
give
the
contract
some
weight
or
maybe
they
won't,
and
if
they
do,
it's
not
clear
how
you
weigh
the
contract
against
the
interest
of
justice.
it
gives
a
broad
discretion.
it
says
they
may
transfer.
1406
is
an
entirely
different
animal.
it
says
you
shall
dismiss
or
--
or
transfer.
it's
sort
of
a
--
you
know,
you
have
the
safety
valve
to
transfer.
and
i
don't
know
why
you
--
you
so
cavalierly
dismiss:
oh,
it's
in
the
contract,
of
course,
but
we've
got
more
witnesses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
couldn't
have
come
as
a
surprise.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
but
the
reason
for
these
clauses
--
the
enforceability
of
these
clauses
is
critically
important
to
a
lot
of
modern
commerce.
if
you
--
i
don't
know
what
the
details
are
here,
but
a
lot
of
times
your
company
--
and
they
are
doing
business
now
all
across
the
country,
and
you
say:
i
don't
want
to
do
business
all
across
the
country
if
i'm
going
to
get
dragged
into
different
courts
who
knows
where
with
different
--
where
the
juries
are
different.
i
want
to
do
business
around
the
country
so
long
as,
if
i
am
going
to
be
sued,
it's
right
here.
so
i'm
only
going
to
do
business
with
people
who
are
willing
to
say:
if
i
have
a
problem,
i
will
sue
you
right
here.
that's
--
that's
critically
important
to
modern
--
modern
commerce.
and
the
idea,
well,
you're
going
to
let
a
court
say,
well,
but
there
are
a
few
more
witnesses
here,
you
know,
it's
convenient
to
them
and
all
that,
that
--
that
seems
to
be
throwing
a
significant
wrench
into
the
process.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
facts
are
--
what
facts
are
--
in
the
normal
case,
what
facts
are
going
to
be
pertinent?
i
mean,
you've
got
the
contract
there.
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
can
always
say,
we
entered
under
duress
and
all
that,
but
that
wouldn't
seem
to
me
to
be
typical
in
the
normal
commercial
case
in
which
these
provisions
are
critically
important.
what
facts
are
going
to
be
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
type
--
what
type
of
materiality?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
venue
provision
--
i
mean,
if
they
go
to
the
trouble
of
putting
a
venue
selection
--
forum
selection
provision
in,
i
would
say
it
seems
pretty
material.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hastings,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
