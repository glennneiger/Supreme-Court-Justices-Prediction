justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hastings,
section
1391
says
the
following,
"except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
"
--not
by
contract
--
"by
law,
this
section
shall
govern
--
shall
govern
--
the
venue
of
all
--
all
civil
actions
brought
in
district
courts
of
the
united
states.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
specify
certain
rules
for
where
venue
in
a
case
can
lie.
so
if
i'm
looking
at
that,
i'm
thinking,
well,
those
rules
apply.
and
they
can't
be
reversed
or
countermanded
or
whatever
by
--
by
contract,
by
parties'
agreement
except
to
the
extent
that
the
contract
can
figure
centrally
into
the
1404
analysis.
but
it's
not
appropriate
in
the
1406
analysis
because,
you
know,
the
statute
says
what
the
statute
says.
here
is
venue.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hastings,
i
wonder
what
you
think
of
this
analogy:
any
party
can
waive
a
personal
jurisdiction
defense,
but
would
you
say
that
parties
by
contract
can
create
personal
jurisdiction
in
a
court
in
which
it
otherwise
doesn't
exist?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
as
i
said,
anybody
can
waive
it.
just
like
anybody
can
waive
almost
everything
in
our
--
in
--
in
the
way
the
federal
rules
work.
but
do
you
think
that
parties
can
actually
create
personal
jurisdiction
where
it
doesn't
exist
by
law?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hastings,
has
12(b)(6)
ever
been
used
to
your
knowledge
to
deal
with
a
case
in
which
the
question
is
which
court
the
plaintiff
should
have
brought
the
suit
in,
rather
than
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
viable
claim
in
any
court?
justice
elena
kagan
because
it
seems
to
me
a
bit
of
a
category
error.
the
12(b)(6)
is
something
--
it's
an
on-the-merits
determination
about
the
viability
of
your
claim.
it
has
res
judicata
effect,
whereas
this
is
not.
this
is
just
a
question
of,
did
you
bring
the
thing
in
the
right
place
and
you
should
be
allowed
to
bring
it
someplace
else.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i
know
the
courts
have.
i'm
saying,
except
for
this
kind
of
case,
has
a
court
ever
used
12(b)(6)
to
deal
with
a
case
of
which
court?
justice
elena
kagan
or
to
deal
with
anything
that's
not
an
on-the-merits
determination
that
precludes
a
case
in
any
court?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
allensworth,
where
you
agreed
not
to
bring
it.
justice
elena
kagan
so
i'm
going
back
to
what
justice
breyer
says.
let's
suppose
you're
right
about
1404,
and
i
think
you
have
some
pretty
good
arguments.
1404,
it
seems
to
me,
shouldn't
affect
this
case
in
the
sense
that
you
should
have
--
this
was
a
negotiated
contract.
you
got
something
for
the
fact
that
you
accepted
inconvenience
when
you
brought
a
suit.
and
under
1404,
the
court
is
perfectly
entitled
--
the
court
has
to
take
that
into
account,
that
this
was
a
negotiated
contract,
that
you
accepted
in
convenience,
and
that
you
got
something
for
your
--
for
your
acceptance
of
inconvenience.
the
end.
you
have
to
live
with
your
contract.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
does
in
this
way.
justice
elena
kagan
it
does
in
this
way.
1404,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
is
a
codification
of
forum
non
conveniens
law,
which
is
a
balancing
of
private
and
public
interests.
it
seems
to
me
what
justice
alito
said
was
absolutely
right.
you
have
given
up
the
ability
to
claim
private
interests
here
by
virtue
of
your
choice
to
sign
that
contract.
the
only
thing
that
could
weigh
in
the
balance
against
that
is
if
there
is
some
--
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
convenience
but
is
instead
a
feature
of
--
of
--
something
about
why
it's
important
to
the
judicial
system,
to
the
public
interest,
about
keeping
the
trial
in
one
place.
and
as
justice
alito
suggested,
you
have
not
been
able
to
point
to
anything,
nor
would
there
be
anything
to
point
to,
in
most
cases
involving
forum
selection
clauses.
justice
elena
kagan
no.
bremen
is
an
admiralty
case.
why
won't
it
just
be
a
forum
non
conveniens?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
i
mean,
1404,
it
says
that
if
it's
says
--
if
the
contract
clause
specifies
a
federal
court,
it's
a
1404
motion.
if
it
specifies
a
state
court,
it's
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
not
1406.
it's
just
forum
non
conveniens,
which
is--
justice
elena
kagan
--professor
sachs
says
that
in
the
case
of
any
disputed
facts
on
a
12(b)(6),
you
would
have
to
have
a
trial.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
you
mistook
my
point
at
least.
maybe
i
didn't
express
it
clearly.
bremen
comes
up
on
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion,
and
the
court
says,
yes,
the
contract
controls,
quite
properly
so.
so,
you
know,
the
fact
that
it
comes
up
on
a
forum
non
conveniens
motion
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
the
contract
controls
where,
if
it
negotiated
for
a
certain
set
of
things
and
there
is
no
exceptional
public
interest
otherwise.
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
you
one
last
question
about
12(b)(6)?
justice
elena
kagan
which
is,
you
know,
when
1404
is
--
suppose
a
state
which
does
not
recognize
these
clauses,
1404
trumps
that
according
to
stewart.
but
if
you
were
under
12(b)(6),
you
would
have
to
go
to
what
justice
scalia
does
in
the
stewart
dissent.
i
think
you
would
have
to
go
to
a
twin
aims
of
erie
analysis.
and
in
that
circumstance,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
law
would
come
out
the
victor;
isn't
that
right?
