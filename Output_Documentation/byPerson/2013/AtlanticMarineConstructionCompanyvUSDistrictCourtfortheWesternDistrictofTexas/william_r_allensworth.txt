mr.
william
r.
allensworth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
brought
this
$160,000
construction
case
in
the
western
district
of
texas,
which
is
where
we
performed
our
work,
where
the
project's
located,
where
all
the
witnesses
reside,
and
where
virtually
all
of
the
evidence
is
located.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
yes.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
no,
your
honor.
we
have
a
contract,
and
we
are
having
to
live
with
it
in
the
sense
that
we're
up
here
now
15
months
after
the
district
court
ruled
that
we
were
supposed
to
--
we
should
--
15
months
after
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
transfer.
what
we
--
and
we
did
nego
--
and
those
are
indeed
the
terms
of
our
contract.
however,
the
--
we
felt
that
any
court
following
stewart
and
1404
would
weigh
the
interests
of
justice
in
the
decision
whether
to
grant
the
transfer
or
not,
and
indeed,
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
found.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
if
i
might,
your
honor,
first
off,
the
district
court
didn't
give
any
shrift
to
our
witness.
he
was
concerned
with
the
nonparty
witnesses
who
were
not
a
party
to
this--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--they
were
neither
atlantic
marine's
witnesses
nor
our
witnesses.
they
were
nonparty
witnesses,
and
the
issue
that
judge
higginbotham
addressed
in
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--exactly.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
your
honor--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--your
honor,
our
point
is
that
if
it's
in
texas,
they
can
get
in
their
pickup
and
drive
to
the
courthouse
and
testify.
and
if
this
case
is
moved
to
virginia,
those
witnesses
essentially
are
unavailable
to
us.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
we'd
be
the
ones
calling
them.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
the
law
of
texas,
which
we
think
applies
to
this
case,
with
which
the
district
court--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--i
wouldn't
suggest
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
your
honor,
in
some
ways
that's
exactly
what
we're
worried
about.
the
same
place
is
15
months
after
the
court's
ruled
on
the
transfer
motion.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
we
filed
a
motion.
if
we
filed
--
if
we
filed
this
lawsuit
in
virginia
and
filed
it
simultaneously
with
a
1404
motion--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--by
their
lights--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--the
court,
as
i
think
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
couldn't
transfer
it
back
to
texas
anyway
because
by
their
lights,
venue
is
improper
anywhere
expect
virginia.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
if
there
wasn't
--
if
there
hadn't
been
a
forum
selection
clause
in
the
contract
and
we'd
filed
suit
in
texas,
it's
inconceivable
that
they
could
--
they
could
have
successfully
moved
the
case
to
virginia.
the
only
thing
going
in
favor
of
this
case
going
to
virginia
is
that
forum
selection
clause.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
it's
a
significant
factor.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
it
is
in
the
--
your
honor,
it
is
in
the
contract.
because
it's
in
the
contract,
we
didn't
get
the
deference
that
otherwise
plaintiff
would
get
on
selection
of
venue.
we
had--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--no,
sir.
and
we
haven't
--
we
haven't
attacked
the
clause
on
bremen
standards.
we
haven't
claimed
it
was
induced
by
fraud
or
that
it
was
overreaching.
we
accept
that.
the
question
that
we've
got
is
whether
the
--
whether
the
federal
judiciary
has
to
accept
that
contract
clause
as
guiding
their
decision--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--in
most
cases
there
wouldn't
be,
and
that's
why
in
most
cases
the
clauses
are
enforced,
and
that's
why
i
don't
think
you
have
seen
one
of
these
for
25
years.
the
reason
that
we've
got
--
that
we
think
our
case
is
somewhat
unique
is
that
it
involves
a
construction
project
in
the
district
in
which
we
filed
suit.
all
of
the
witnesses
are
there.
virtually
all
of
the
physical
evidence
is
there.
it's
subject,
if
we
stay
in
texas,
to
texas
law.
and
for
those
reasons,
if
the
case
is
going
to
get
sent
to
virginia,
the
systemic
integrity
of
the
system
i
think
is
put
in
play.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
view
it
as
a
wrench,
as
opposed
to
an
opportunity
or
mandate
from
congress
to
the
--
to
the
federal
courts
to
exercise
some
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
enforce
these
clauses
or
not.
stewart
v.
ricoh--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that's
a
possibility.
i
would
say
that
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
arbitration
example
that
you
brought
up,
that
is
governed
by
a
separate
statute
anyway.
so
the
--
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
going
to
govern
whether
that--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--whether
the
arbitration
clause
ought
to
be
enforced
or
not.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
the
court
would
have
to
dismiss
our
case.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
because
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
transfer
it
to
--
he
can't
force
that
into
a
virginia
circuit.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
one
as
in
bremen,
which
didn't
--
in
the
bremen,
which
didn't
mention
court--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--it
--
it
would
be,
and
--
i've
forgotten
which
justice
raised
the
question
about
this.
1404(a)
is
a
codification
of
forum
non
conveniens.
in
the
absence
of
that,
the
case
would
just
be
dismissed.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
with
the
same
result.
i
would
say
the
same
result.
dismissal
would
be--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
because
the
1406
wouldn't
apply
because
the
--
because--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
yes.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
justice
breyer--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--no,
but
that
raises
a
larger
question,
and
if
i
could
--
if
i
could
venture
just
a
second
--
and
that's
the
systemic
integrity
of
the
--
of
the
system.
if
you
are
going
to
transfer
a
case
to
--
within
the
system
to
another
federal
court
that's
going
to
have
to
hear
the
case,
one
like
this
one
where
he
is
likely
going
to
have
to
hear
it
without
witnesses
or
certainly
without
live
witnesses,
and
to
render
a
judgment
based
on
facts
that
were
developed
1,500
miles
away
on
a
project
that
is
that
far
away,
that
does
implicate,
i
think,
the
integrity
of
the
system
and
that
ultimately
a
federal
judge
is
the
one
that's
going
to
have
to
write
and
take
it
up
in
judgment
if
i
can't
scare
up
the
witnesses
to
be
in
virginia.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
i
don't.
and
to
confess
i
haven't
thought
through
the
--
the
question
that
you
just
said.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
van
dusen
said
that
the
law
moves
with
the
--
with
the--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--your
honor--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--your
honor,
the
contract
that
judge
higginbotham
pointed
out
doesn't
have
a
selection
of
law
--
law
clause.
they
put
--
it's
got
every
other
dispute
resolution
clause
that
could
be
in
there
to
make
it
difficult
for
us
to
get
this
case
to
a
court,
but
it
doesn't
have
a
--
it
doesn't
have
a
choice
of
law
provision
in
it.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
i
don't
recall.
sorry.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
first
off,
on
the
validity
of
the
clause,
we
acknowledge
we'd
have
the
burden.
we
were
trying
to
avoid
this
clause
on
the
ground,
on
whatever
grounds,
on
any
bremen
grounds
or
we
got
cheated
into
it
or
anything
like
that.
we'd
have
the
burden
on
that.
we
didn't
try
to
carry
that
burden.
we're
not
attacking
the
clause.
they
have
the
burden
on
the
main
case
--
on
the
transfer
itself.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
i
don't
think
that
it's
even
a
matter
really
so
much
of
burden
as
it
is
of
weight.
and
you
all
already
have
spoken
on
that
where
you
said
that
it's
--
that
clause
is
to
get
significant
--
significant
weight.
it
ought
to
be
central
to
the
analysis,
but
it's
not
dispositive.
and
our
--
our
contention
was
that
the
clause
was
not
dispositive,
but
that
every
--
every
factor
that
possibly
could
go
--
militate
against
transferring
this
case
to
virginia
existed,
and
that's
why
the
court,
giving
appropriate
deference
to
the
clause,
to
that
clause,
hearing
what
the
evidence
was
and
deciding
as
you--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--we
can't
confer
venue.
we
can
--
we
can
waive
venue,
but
we
can't
make
improper
venue--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--there's
a
couple
of
factors
on
that,
your
honor.
first
off,
the
rule
that
i
think
my
colleagues
here
are
calling
for
effectively
emasculates
1404
and
takes
the
federal
judiciary
out
of
it.
the
question
--
and
i
follow
your
question
about
the
propriety
of
the
venue.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
another
reason
for
that
is
that
our
contract
has
a
one-way
arbitration
clause
in
it
which
they
--
which
the
petitioner
claims
not
to
have
waived.
if
this
case
is
decided
--
it
goes
to
virginia
--
if
we
filed
the
case
in
virginia
and
they
immediately
demanded
arbitration,
the
case
would
be
arbitrated.
but
under
the
faa,
it
would
be
sent
to
an
--
it'd
be
--
the
court
in
virginia
would
appoint
an
arbitrator
in
--
presumably
in
virginia.
and
under
the
faa,
we
don't
even
necessarily
even
have
the
right
to
take
depositions
to
provide
--
to
move
to
get
the
evidence
before
the
court
even
in
deposition
form.
we'd
rather
have
the
case
decided
in
texas
on
$160,000
case,
and
i
know
that's
a
pittance.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
no.
if
we
go
to
arbitration,
we
go
to
arbitration
in
texas.
we
don't
have
any
complaint
about
that.
what
we
don't
want
to
do
is
go
to
arbitration
in
virginia,
which
it
has
not
had
--
and
in
this
contract,
for
everything
it's
got
in
it,
it
doesn't
have
a
clause
that
says
that
arbitration
would
be
conducted
in
--
there's
not
a
choice
of
forum
clause
for
the
arbitration.
there
is
for
litigation,
but
not
for
arbitration.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
that's
my--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--it's
convenient
for
us.
the
arbitrator
can
drive
out
to
the
project
and
draw
his
own
conclusions
about
what
--
about
how
the
thing
is
built.
he
can
talk
to
the
witnesses
who
are
within
his
subpoena
power
or
the
subpoena
power
of
our
district
court
in
texas
to
show
up.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
i
think
that
that's
going
to
unnecessarily
complicate
this.
it
gets
in
--
it
raises
some
difficult
to
hearing
questions
about
which
--
difficult
hearing
questions
which
the
court,
i
think,
successfully
avoided
in
--
with
its
decision
in
stewart.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
12(b)
motions
are
particularly
appropriate
places
to
decide
these
contract
issues.
and
it
eliminates
the
1404
gatekeeper
role
that
the
district
court
otherwise
could
be
providing
and
was
providing.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
he
under
--
underestimates
the
ability
for
resolute
counsel
to
raise
undisputed
facts
that
would
otherwise
prevent
the
summary
judgment
practice
that
he
suggested--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--i
think
there
might
be
a
question
of
materiality.
there
might
be
a
question--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--how
material
that
clause
was
to
the
parties'
contract
or
whether
you
were
going
to
try
to
have
severability
and
focus
exclusively
on
that
clause.
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
it
might
or
might
not,
depending
on
whichever
state
law
applies
to
--
and
what
--
because
that
would
be
under
state
law
to
decide
on
the
materiality,
what
the
effect
of
the
prior
breach
is.
we
--
this
case
has
been
cast
in
manatee
in
terms
about
our
breach
of
the
contract
by
failing
to
file
suit
in
virginia.
the
only
written
--
the
only
handwritten
clause
in
this
entire
contract,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
i
think,
at
page
16,
is
the
one
that
says
what
the
price
is.
what
brings
us
here
to
the
federal
system
is
not
for
a
declaratory
relief
or
to
make
new
law
on
venue;
it's
to
collect
$160,000.
that
clause,
i
think,
ultimately
would
be
weighed
--
may
be
weighed
depending
on
the
court,
if
it
--
if
the
case
was
being
decided
on
purely--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--i
--
i
wish.
[laughter]
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
and
the
other
thing,
as
professor
sachs
points
out--
mr.
william
r.
allensworth
--the
--
as
he
points
out,
and
justice
haynes
--
judge
haynes
did
in
the
fifth
circuit,
whether
they
can
file
suit
for
us
for
breach
of
contract
and
the
expense
that
we
put
them
to.
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
they
probably
could.
we
at
least
get
$160,000
head
start
on
that,
and
they
can
bring
that
as
an
offset
to
our
claim
if
they
want
to.
we
disagree
with
the
question
of
whether
it
would
cost
them
any
more
to
litigate
in
texas
than
it
would
in
virginia
anyway.
they're
going
to
have
to
hire
a
law
firm.
if
we
litigate
in
virginia,
they
are
going
to
have
to
send
a
lot
of
--
batch
of
lawyers
back
to
texas
to
defend
the
depositions
that
we'd
ask
to
be
taken
there.
i
don't
know
that
this
case
costs
any
more
to
be
litigated
in
texas
where
the
witnesses
are
available
and
where
they
might
not
have
to
be
deposed
than
in
virginia
where
they
have
to
--
where
they
have
to
ship
them
across
the
country.
if
there
is
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
