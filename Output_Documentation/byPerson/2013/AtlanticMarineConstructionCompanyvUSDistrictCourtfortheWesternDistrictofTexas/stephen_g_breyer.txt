justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
one
question
here.
it
seems
--
because
i
start
out
for
reasons
i
won't
go
into
thinking,
well,
perhaps
it
doesn't
matter,
frankly;
you
can
get
to
the
same
result
under
any
one
of
these
three
approaches.
but
then
one
thing
professor
sachs
says
does
bother
me,
that
if
we
take
your
approach
then
how
do
we
deal
with
the
problem
of
removal?
i
mean,
you
can
only
remove
a
case
to
a
court
which
is
in
the
district
where
the
person
--
the
plaintiff
filed.
now,
if
there
is
a
forum
selection
clause,
the
defendant
seems
to
me
to
be
stuck,
because
he
can't
go
to
a
--
he
can't
go
to
a
--
to
another.
he
can't
go
to
another
court.
he
can't
go
to
the
court
within
the
district
because
of
the
forum
selection
clause,
and
he
can't
go
into
another
court
because
of
1441(a).
so
that
argues
to
me
that
we
ought
to
either
take
the
1404
approach
or
we
ought
to
take
professor
sachs'
approach,
unless
you
have
an
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't
really
explain
--
i'm
sorry.
i'll
read
it
more
carefully
later.
but
how
--
it
says
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
remove
to
the
court
or
the
district
or
division
where
the
place
of
action
is
pending.
so
if
it's
filed
in
state
court
in
texas
you
have
to
remove
to
the
texas
federal
court.
now,
how
do
we
get
--
and
you
can't
go
to
the
texas
federal
court,
according
to
you,
because
of
the
contract.
okay.
now,
how
--
now,
you
explain
how
--
how
this
provision
over
1390(c)
gets
around
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
--
in
other
words,
you
can
remove
to
the
texas
court
even
though
it
says
you
can
remove
--
you
can
remove
to
the
district
court
despite
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
despite
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
the
court
should
say
in
texas
is:
we
have
a
contract
which
says
you
have
to
go
to
virginia,
but
because
of
1390(a)
we
forget
about
the
contract
and
we
remove
it
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
you're
saying
texas
should
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
about
--
suppose
the
plaintiff
says:
please
dismiss
this
immediately
because
of
1406,
or,
you
know,
because
1406
says
you
have
to
dismiss
it;
venue
isn't
proper
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
contract
says
you
go
to
virginia.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
filed
it
in
texas
state
court.
you
tried
to
remove
it
to
texas
federal
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
say:
i'm
very
sorry.
the
contract
that
he
loves
says
we
can't
remove
it
to
texas
federal
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
problem
with
this?
you
admit
that
if
he
goes
to
virginia
--
well,
he
files
his
suit
in
virginia.
all
right.
then
he
says,
judge,
everything's
in
texas,
please
remove
under
1404(a),
you
know,
go
--
send
it
down
to
texas.
and
you
agree
that
--
that
in
an
unusual
case
you
say,
because
you
give
a
lot
of
weight
to
the
contract,
he
could
win
and
go
to
texas,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
position,
fine.
if
that's
your
position,
what
conceivable
difference
does
it
make
if
he
goes
to
texas
in
the
first
place
and
then
you
say
remove
it
to
virginia?
i
mean,
it
should
work
out
the
same
way.
it
should
work
out
that
the
balancing
under
1404,
you
know,
it
gives
you
the
--
the
factors
should
be
the
same,
shouldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
terrible
thing.
you
have
to
say
1404(a),
and
the
other
case
he
has
to
say
1404(a)
and
it
--
i
mean,
maybe
it
makes
some
tremendous
practical
difference.
but
if
it
makes
not
much
difference,
i
have
three
routes
that
seem
to
me
all
should
work
out
the
same
way,
and
in
favor
of
their
route
is
the
absolute
language
that
justice
kagan
pointed
out
before,
plus
the
footnote.
okay?
so
i'm
thinking,
hey,
this
doesn't
make
--
it's
important
to
have
a
rule.
it's
important
to
have
one
clear
approach.
but
as
between
the
three,
it
shouldn't
matter,
and
they
should
all
reach
the
same
conclusions.
so
let's
go
with
the
language
of
stewart.
all
right.
what
about
--
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
why
--
why
then
couldn't
you
go
to
virginia
with
all
these
factors?
i
mean,
maybe
the
jury
has
to
take
42
visits
to
the
bottom
of
an
oil
well
shaft.
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
there
could
be
something
that
would
weigh
in
your
favor.
i
don't
know
the
case.
so
why
not
go
to
virginia
and
then
file
a
1404
motion?
and
it
should
reach
the
same
result,
whether
you
--
you
go
to
texas
and
ask
to
stay
there
or
whether
you
go
to
virginia
under
1404(a)
--
you
win
this
case,
let's
say
--
or
whether
you
go
to
virginia.
it
should
get
to
the
same
place,
shouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
actually
your
expense
because
you
would
have
to
go
to
virginia
and
you
would
have
to
file
the
motion.
maybe
you
can
do
it
by
mail
or
you'd
have
to
--
but
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
they
are
not
saying
--
they
said
that
you
could
make
the
1404
motion
in
virginia,
and
they
think
it
would
only
be
granted
in
an
exceptional
case,
but
that's
their
opinion
in
that,
and
so
it
should
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
they
aren't
barring
you
from
that
on
their
view.
but
my
thought
is
that
if
all
these
come
to
the
same
result
in
the
end
and
you
just
need
one
ruling,
we
have
something
pointing
on
their
side
--
your
side,
which
is
the
stewart
footnote
and
the
language
of
the
--
you
know,
the
absolute
language
of
the
venue
statutes,
and
you
have
something
pointing
in
their
side,
which
is,
if
we
count
by
numbers,
five
circuits
are
in
their
favor
and
only
three
in
yours.
all
right.
help
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
argues,
then,
it
might
be
slightly
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
--
if
in
fact
you
specify
a
state
court,
if
in
fact
you
specify
a
foreign
court,
if
in
fact
you
specify
arbitration,
you
agree
in
those
instances
you
are
going
to
use
forum
non
conveniens
or
you
are
going
to
use
1406.
but
you
are
saying
where
you
specify
a
court
in
a
different
state,
namely
a
federal
court
in
a
different
state,
there
you
use
1404.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it
was
forum
non
conveniens.
oh,
you
use
forum
non
conveniens
in
all
three?
you
don't
use
--
i
mean,
they
specify
a
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
say
venue
is
a
state
court--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--use
forum
non
conveniens
in
all
those?
okay.
use
forum
non
conveniens
in
all
those,
but
you
use
1404
if
they
specify
another
federal
court.
that's
what
--
that's
what
--
that's
what
you're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
use
12(b)(3),
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
point
is
you're
using
something
else,
so
they
would
say,
well,
let's
have
it
the
same
--
you
know
--
okay.
i
see
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
forget
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know
the
answer,
this
is
another
--
i
keep
thinking
they
should
all
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
but,
then,
what
about
this
point
justice
sotomayor
raised.
suppose
you
sue
in
texas.
you
know,
you
get
there,
but
the
contract,
let's
say,
was
a
different
contract
from
yours,
but
it
just
was
made
in
nevada.
everything
about
this
concerns
nevada.
are
they
really
going
to
use
texas
law
to
interpret
the
contract
rather
than
nevada's?
i
would
have
thought
that
the
choice
of
law
question
is
a
different
question,
and
where
you
sue
should
be
irrelevant
to
the
choice
of
law
question
except
insofar
--
i
don't
know.
maybe
you
looked--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
--
are
you
finished?
all
right.
i'd
just
like,
if
you'd
want,
to
give
you
a
chance
to
take
what
i've
--
i
think
professor
sachs
says,
look,
there
is
a
way
which
you
can
both
follow
the
statutes
literally
and
say,
well,
venue
is
here,
and
also
get
the
place
to
the
right
forum
respecting
the
contract.
just
say
it
is
an
affirmative
defense,
which
justice
ginsburg
says
the
first
circuits
follow
this
approach.
you
put
it
in
the
complaint.
the
answer,
and
once
it's
in
the
answer,
the
judge
can
put
it
front
and
center.
indeed,
in
case
he
forgets
to
do
that,
the
defendant
will
remind
him
and
say
you've
got
to
get
it
to
the
right
court
and
let's
decide
this
affirmative
defense
thing
first.
and
--
and
now
we're
back
in
the
same
place.
what
do
you
think
of
that?
