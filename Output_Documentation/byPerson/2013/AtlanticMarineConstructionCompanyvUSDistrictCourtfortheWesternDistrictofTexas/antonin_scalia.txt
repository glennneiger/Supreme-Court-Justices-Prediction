justice
antonin
scalia
could
--
could
i
ask,
what
difference
would
it
make
to
you
if
--
if
i
thought
the
venue
here
is
proper,
but
i
thought
that
there
--
there
was
no
cause
of
action
in
this
circuit,
and
the
case
--
as
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
proposed.
what
difference
would
that
make
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
but
what
if
there
is
no
personal
jurisdiction,
okay,
and
the
--
and
the
suit
is
dismissed
because
there
is
no
personal
jurisdiction.
would
a
federal
court
transfer
it
to
--
to
another
court
that
has
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that?
why
wouldn't
1404(a)
continue
to
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
but
it
depends
upon
--
upon
the
defendant.
if
he
chooses
to
go
the
1404(a)
route,
he
could
go
that
way,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wouldn't
have
to
move
under
12(b)(6),
would
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
--
so
it
wouldn't
necessarily
overrule
stewart.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
volunteer
witnesses?
are
they
just
going
to
walk
in
the
courtroom
and
say
i'd
--
i'd
would
like
to
testify?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
surely,
they're
one
side's
or
the
other's,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
--
what
kind
of
proceedings
do
they
have
there?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
--
don't
put
me
in
the
group
that
thinks
you
can
use
forum
non
conveniens.
when
--
when
you
have
a
forum
selection
clause
for
a
state
court
and
suit
is
brought
--
attempted
to
be
brought
in
a
federal
court
--
i
mean,
if
it's
in
the
federal
court,
that
is
the
most
convenient
court
--
i
mean,
let's
say
it's
in
--
in
a
different
state
where
all
the
witnesses
are.
i
think
it's
very
strange
to
say
that,
because
there
is
a
contract
provision
requiring
it
to
be
brought
in
a
state
court,
this
court
is
an
inconvenient
court.
i
--
do
you
know
that
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens
has
ever
been
used
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
should
have
been
a
virginia
court
to
make
that
decision
instead
of
your
friendly,
down
home
texas
court.
and
that's
--
you
know,
that
was
why
the
forum
selection
clause
was
put
in
there.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
such
a
stretch
as
you
think
it
is
to
say
that
the
venue
is
improper
when
you
have
agreed
that
venue
would
not
lie
in
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
--
the
question
is:
is
it
improper
when
it's
been
waived?
is
it
improper
for
a
court
to
acknowledge
venue
when
the
party
has
--
has
said
i
--
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
bring
my
suit
in
this
court.
i
don't
think
it's
a
terrible
stretch
to
--
to
call
that
improper
venue.
however
theoretical
it
may
be,
venue
is
--
is
decided
by
--
by
statute,
of
course
it
is.
but
people
may
waive
it,
and
when
people
have
waived
it,
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
great
interest
in
--
in
saying
that,
nonetheless,
the
venue
remains
proper.
it
seems
to
me
you've
given
it
away
and
it
ought
to
be
--
it
ought
to
be
the
--
the
court
where
the
parties
agree
that
suit
would
lie
that
would
decide
these
--
these
change-of-venue
questions.
the
provision
need
not
be
absolutely
dispositive,
but
to
the
extent
it
isn't,
that
is
a
call
that
--
that
ought
to
be
made
by
the
jurisdiction
that
the
parties
agreed
to.
the
whole
litigation
ought
to
begin
there.
they
shouldn't
have
to
litigate
this
change
of
venue
provision
in
a
court
where
the
parties
agreed
they
would
not
appear.
it
seems
to
me
terribly
unfair.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
why
can't
the
court,
where
you
agreed
to
be
sued,
apply
1404?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish.
[laughter]
