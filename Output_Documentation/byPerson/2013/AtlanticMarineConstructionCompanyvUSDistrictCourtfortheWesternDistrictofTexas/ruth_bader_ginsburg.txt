that's
only
--
what
that
tells
us
is
that
venue
is
a
highly
waiverable
thing.
you
can
stand
on
your
venue
right,
but
you
don't
have
to.
my
problem
with
your
interpretation
is
you
are
allowing
a
private
agreement
to
make
a
venue
prescription
that
congress
enacted
improper.
congress
said
it
was
proper.
it
may
be
that
it
should
not
apply
in
this
case
because
the
parties
have
consented
to
something
else,
but
it's
not
a
wrong
venue.
i
mean,
suppose
the
question
had
never
come
up.
the
--
there
wasn't
a
claim
that
this
was
a
wrong
venue.
the
--
the
case
could
have
proceeded,
and
it
would
have
been
a
place
of
proper
venue,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
become
--
it's
a
place
of
proper
venue.
there
may
be
a
reason
why
another
venue
is
the
one
that
should
control
in
this
case.
but
you
can't
make
a
private
agreement
--
can't
say
what
congress
says
is
proper
is
improper.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
doesn't
mean
it's
improper.
it
means
it's
waiverable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
consent
is
a
basis
for
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
--
that's
a
problem
with
the
argument.
both
1404(a)
and
1406
provide
for
transfer.
this
court
has
emphasized
that
it's
one
federal
system,
and
within
the
federal
system,
the
result
shouldn't
be
dismissed,
bring
the
case
all
over
again,
pay
a
new
filing
fee;
instead
of
that,
just
transfer
to
the
appropriate
forum.
and
that's
what
professor
sachs's
view
leaves
out,
because
the
result,
as
you
say,
is
--
it's
only
dismissal.
no
transfer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
--
it's
--
1404(a)
and
1406
deal
with
venue.
they
don't
deal
with
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
state
forum
or
foreign
forum,
but
1404(a)
is
a
codification
of
the
forum
non
conveniens
doctrine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that.
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
you
have
to
raise
it
or
you
lose
it.
you
can't
hold
back
an
affirmative
defense,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
say:
oh,
there's
an
affirmative
defense
here.
(8)(c)
requires
you
to
state
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
taken
care
of
simply
by
saying
van
dusen
v.
barrack
does
not
apply
when
a
party
is
acting
in
violation
of
a
contractual
provision.
van
dusen
against
barrack
was
intended
to
give
the
plaintiff
plaintiff's
choice
of
initial
forum.
if
plaintiff
chooses
a
forum
in
violation
of
the
contract,
there's
no
reason
why
van
dusen
should
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
--
the
clause
here
allows
suits
in
--
in
state
or
federal
court.
suppose
the
clause
--
the
forum
selection
clause
just
said
"all
disputes
shall
be
litigated
in
the
circuit
court
for
the
city
of
norfolk.
"
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
what
would
be
the
result
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
equally--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
same
thing
if
--
if
the
choice
was
of
an
arbitral
forum,
then
you
recognize
in
those
two
cases
the
result
would
have
to
be
dismissal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
because
the
plaintiff
--
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
was
to
be
respected.
but
if
the
plaintiff
chooses
a
forum
in
violation
of
the
contract,
the
whole
rationale
of
that
case
falls.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
to
honor
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum.
well,
the
contract
says
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
a
choice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
the
only
reason
that
van
dusen
came
out
the
way
it
did
was
--
i
think
it
was
that
justice
black
said
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
merits
respect.
it
doesn't
merit
respect
when
the
plaintiff
has
agreed
that
the
suit
will
go
forward
someplace
else.
