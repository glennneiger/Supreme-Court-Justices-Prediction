justice
elena
kagan
well,
let's
say
this
one,
ms.
murphy.
let's
say
this
one:
you
have
100
pacs
and
each
of
them
say
that
they're
going
to
support
the
five
contest
--
the
five
candidates
in
the
most
contested
senate
races.
there
are
really
only
five
very
contested
senate
races,
and
100
pacs
say
that
they're
going
to
support
those
five
candidates.
so
a
donor
gives
$5,000
to
each
of
those
100
pacs
which
support
those
candidates,
the
pac
divides
up
the
money,
$1,000
goes
to
each
candidate.
the
total,
all
those
pacs,
$100,000
goes
to
each
of
the
--
of
the
senate
candidates
in
the
five
most
contested
races,
20
times
what
the
individual
contribution
limits
allow.
justice
elena
kagan
this
candidate
knows
all
of
his
$100,000
donors.
there
are
not
all
that
many
of
them.
he
can
keep
them
all
in
his
head
in
a
mental
rolodex.
justice
elena
kagan
five
of
the
most
contested
senate
races.
so
a
person
gives
$100,000
to
each
of
five
candidates
who
if
they
win
become
the
five
senators
that
are
most
attuned
to
donors.
and
he
knows
who's
giving
him
$100,000,
each
of
those
five
senators
who
gets
in
on
the
strength
of
these
contributions
that
are
20
times
what
the
individual
limits
allow.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
murphy,
if
you
think
it's
earmarking
that
have
a
pac
that
gives
money
to
the
five
most
--
the
candidates
in
the
five
most
contested
senate
races,
i
just
don't
think
any
fec
would
say
that
that's
earmarking.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
murphy,
can
i
give
another
one?
there
are
150
house
candidates
with
completely
safe
seats,
all
right?
and
there
are
maybe,
you
know,
30
or
40
or
something
like
that
in
their
party
who
don't
have
safe
seats.
so
the
150
gets
together
and
they
say
we're
going
to
run
a
joint
fundraiser.
and
anybody
can
contribute
$2600
to
each
of
these
candidates,
150
of
them,
right?
so
that
makes
about
$400,000.
and
then
these
150
candidates
with
completely
safe
seats
just
transfer
all
this
money
to
the
one
person
who
doesn't
have
a
safe
seat.
so
that's
about
$400,000.
double
it
for
a
primary
and
a
general
election,
that's
about
$800,000
that
all
goes
to
one
candidate
from
one
donor
because
of
the
ability
for
candidates
to
transfer
money
to
each
other.
justice
elena
kagan
a
candidate
can
transfer
a
maximum
of
$2600
to
another
candidate
per
election.
justice
elena
kagan
i
stand
corrected
on
the
basis
of
$600.
justice
elena
kagan
you're
exactly
right.
you're
exactly
right,
ms.
murphy.
one
person
could
make
an
$800,000
contribution
to
a
house
race,
where
$800,000
goes
a
long
way.
and
then
what
these
150
candidates
can
do
is
they
can
do
it
for
every
single
other
candidate
in
a
contested
seat.
so
take
your
30
or
40
house
contested
seats
and
it
becomes
a
conduit
for
a
single
person
to
make
an
$800,000
contribution
to
a
candidate
in
a
contested
district.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
burchfield,
if
you
take
off
the
aggregate
limits,
people
will
be
allowed,
if
you
put
together
the
national
committees
and
all
the
state
committees
and
all
the
candidates
in
the
house
and
the
senate,
it
comes
to
over
$3.5
million.
so
i
can
write
checks
totalling
$3.5
million
to
the
republican
party
committees
and
all
its
candidates
or
to
the
democratic
party
committees
and
all
its
committees
even
before
i
start
writing
checks
to
independent
pacs.
now,
having
written
a
check
for
3.5
or
so
million
dollars
to
a
single
party's
candidates,
are
you
suggesting
that
that
party
and
the
members
of
that
party
are
not
going
to
owe
me
anything,
that
i
won't
get
any
special
treatment?
because
i
thought
that
that
was
exactly
what
we
said
in
mcconnell,
that
when
we
talked
about
soft
money
restrictions,
we
understood
that
you
give
$3.5
million,
you
get
a
very,
very
special
place
at
the
table.
so
this
is
effectively
to
--
to
reintroduce
the
soft
money
scheme
of
mcconnell,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
money
--
the
money
goes
to
a
single
party.
and
indeed,
i
could
make
this
even
worse.
i
could
say,
let's
say
the
speaker
of
the
house
or
the
majority
leader
of
the
house
solicits
this
money
from
particular
people.
so
solicits
somebody
to
ante
up
his
$3.6
million.
and
then,
you
know,
justice
kennedy
said
in
mcconnell
the
making
of
a
solicited
gift
is
a
quid
both
to
the
recipient
of
the
money
and
to
the
one
who
solicits
the
payment.
so
the
speaker,
the
majority
leader,
can
solicit
$3.6
million
to
all
the
party
members
and
you're
telling
me
there's
just
no
special
influence
that
goes
along
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
and
general,
i
suppose
that
if
this
court
is
having
second
thoughts
about
its
rulings
that
independent
expenditures
are
not
corrupting,
we
could
change
that
part
of
the
law.
[laughter]
