i'm
a
little
confused,
okay?
i'm
confused
because
we're
talking
in
the
abstract.
this
decision
was
based
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
there
is
a
huge
colloquy
about
what
happens
and
doesn't
happen.
we
don't
have
a
record
below.

i
mean,
i
can
go
into
the
news,
as
justice
breyer
suggested.
it's
very
hard
to
think
that
any
candidate
doesn't
know
the
contributor
who
has
enough
money
to
give
not
only
to
himself
or
herself,
but
to
any
of
his
or
her
affiliates
who
are
supporting
him
or
her.
i
mean,
it's
nearly
common
sense,
hard
to
dispute.
so
you're
saying
it
can't
happen,
but
i
don't
see
charges
of
coordination
going
on
that
much.

you're
taking
a
position
--
you're
taking
a
position
that
the
law
stops
corruption.
and
you're
suggesting
that
the
government
is
incapable
of
showing
facts
that
the
law
doesn't
work?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
it
is?
don't
you
need
facts
to
prove
that
or
disprove
that
proposition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
how
is
it
that--
