justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
if
you
named
the
pac
after
a
particular
candidate
as
the
hypothetical
assumes,
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
federal
election
commission
wouldn't
come
after
you
for
earmarking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine
that
if
you
have
a
pac
which
says
we're
going
to
give
money
to
smith,
that's
bad,
but
if
you
have
a
pac
that
says
we're
going
to
give
all
the
money
that
you
contribute
to
us
to
smith
and
jones,
that's
okay.
or
smith,
jones
and
three
others.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
earmarking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
a
law
that
only
--
only
prohibits
the
speech
of
2
percent
of
the
country
is
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
murphy,
do
--
do
we
need
a
record
to
figure
out
issues
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
i
agree.
[laughter]
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
--
that
this
campaign
finance
law
is
so
intricate
that
i
can't
figure
it
out.
it
might
have
been
nice
to
have
the,
you
know,
the
lower
court
tell
me
what
the
law
is.
but
we
don't
normally
require
a
record
to
decide
questions
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
is
it
--
is
it
correct
that
the
consequence
of
this
provision
has
been
very
severe
with
respect
to
national
political
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
much
of
the
money
that
used
to
go
to
them
now
goes
to
pacs;
isn't
that
what
has
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
this
is
really,
you
know,
turning
the
dials
on
--
on
regulating
elections.
now,
i
ask
myself,
why
would
--
why
would
members
of
congress
want
to
hurt
their
political
parties?
and
i
answer
--
i
answer
to
myself--
[laughter]
--well,
ordinarily,
the
national
political
parties
will
devote
their
money
to
elections
in
those
states
where
the
incumbent
has
a
good
chance
of
losing.
so,
in
fact,
if
you're
an
incumbent
who
cares
about
political
parties,
i
don't
want
money
to
go
to
my
opponents.
and
if
you
--
if
you
turn
down
the
amount
of
money
that
the
national
political
parties
have,
that's
that
much
less
money
that
can
be
devoted
against
you
if
you're
challenged
in
a
close
race.
isn't
that
the
consequence
of
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
a
surprise.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
does
not
--
that
does
not
evoke
any
gratitude
on
the
part
of
the
people?
i
mean,
if
gratitude
is
corruption,
you
know,
don't
those
independent
expenditures
evoke
gratitude?
and
is
--
is
not
the
evil
of
big
money
--
3.2
million,
an
individual
can
give
that
to
an
independent
pac
and
spend
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
that
we're
stopping
people
from
spending
big
money
on
politics.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
that
--
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
line
eliminates
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
here,
which
are
arguments
against
big
money
in
politics.
there
--
big
money
can
be
in
politics.
the
thing
is
you
can't
give
it
to
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party,
but
you
can
start
your
own
pac.
that's
perfectly
good.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
benefit
to
our
political
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
boeing
does
it?
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
no
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
they're
regulated.
that's
the
law,
but
the
question
says
--
what
the
question
is
directed
at,
given
that
that's
the
law,
isn't
the
consequence
of
--
of
this
particular
provision
to
sap
the
vitality
of
political
parties
and
to
encourage
--
what
should
i
say
--
you
know,
drive-by
pacs
for
each
election?
isn't
that
the
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
--
you
say
it's
$3.5
million.
if
you
assume
somebody
that
gives
the
maximum
to
every
possible
candidate
and
party
he
can
contribute
to
throughout
the
united
states,
3.5
million.
just
to
put
that
in
perspective,
how
much
money
is
spent
by
political
parties
and
pacs
in
all
elections
throughout
the
country--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
one
election
cycle?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
idea
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
1.5
billion.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
pacs?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that
was
a
lot
in
the
last
few
elections,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
what
about
newspapers
that
--
that
spend
a
lot
of
money
in
endorsing
candidates
and
promoting
their
candidacy.
i
suppose,
you
know,
you
--
you
have
to
put
in
that
money,
too.
that
is
money
that
is
directed
to
political
speech.
when
you
add
all
that
--
add
--
when
you
add
all
that
up,
i
don't
think
3.5
million
is
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
--spread
throughout
the
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
verrilli,
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
fanciful
to
think
that
the
sense
of
gratitude
that
an
individual
senator
or
congressman
is
going
to
feel
because
of
a
substantial
contribution
to
the
republican
national
committee
or
democratic
national
committee
is
any
greater
than
the
sense
of
gratitude
that
that
senator
or
congressman
will
feel
to
a
pac
which
is
spending
enormous
amount
of
money
in
his
district
or
in
his
state
for
his
election.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
latter
is
much
more
identifiable,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
excludes
that.
so
apparently
that's
not
too
much
of
a
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
what
it
is,
though.
