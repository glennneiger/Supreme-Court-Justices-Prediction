mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
aggregate
limits
combat
corruption.
let
me
start
by
explaining
exactly
how.
aggregate
limits
combat
corruption
both
by
blocking
circumvention
of
individual
contribution
limits
and,
equally
fundamentally,
by
serving
as
a
bulwark
against
a
campaign
finance
system
dominated
by
massive
individual
contributions
in
which
the
dangers
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
would
be
obvious
and
inherent
and
the
corrosive
appearance
of
corruption
would
be
overwhelming.
now,
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
tried
to
present
the
case
as
though
the
issue
were
whether
there
were
some
corrupting
potential
in
giving
contribution
to
the
nineteenth
candidate
after
someone
has
already
contributed
to
--
the
maximum
to
the
eighteenth.
but
that
is
not
what
this
case
is
about.
the
appellants
are
not
arguing
that
the
aggregate
limit
is
drawn
in
the
wrong
place.
they
are
arguing
that
there
can
be
no
aggregate
limit
because
the
base
contribution
limits
do
all
the
work.
and
so
what
that
means
is
that
you
--
you're
taking
the
lid
off
the
aggregate
contribution
limit
and,
as
justice
kagan
and
her
question
earlier
indicated,
that
means
that
an
individual
can
contribute
every
two
years
up
to
$3.6
million
to
candidates
for
a
party,
party
national
committees
and
state
committees--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
make
two
different
points
in
response
to
that
question.
the
first
is
that
restricting
transfers
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
circumvention
problems.
it
wouldn't
eliminate
all
circumvention
risk,
but
would
have
a
bearing
on
that
problem.
but
there
is
a
more
fundamental
problem
here.
it's
a
problem
analogous
to
the
one
that
was
at
issue
with
soft
money
in
mcconnell,
which
is
the
very
fact
of
delivering
the
$3.6
million
check
to
the
whoever
it
is,
the
speaker
of
the
house,
the
senate
majority
leader,
whoever
it
is
who
solicits
that
check,
the
very
fact
of
delivering
that
check
creates
the
inherent
opportunity
for
quid
pro
quo
corruption,
exactly
the
kind
of
risk
that
the
court
identified
in
buckley,
wholly
apart
from
where
that
money
goes
after
it's
delivered.
but
the
delivery
of
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--let
me
make
a
specific
point
about
that
and
then
work
into
the
framework.
the
specific
point
is
this:
the
aggregate
limit
would
have
the
effect
of
restricting
the
ability
of
a
contributor
to
make
the
maximum
contribution
to
more
than
a
certain
number
of
candidates.
that's
true.
we
can't
help
but
acknowledge
that.
it's
math.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
individual
cannot
spend
as
much
as
the
individual
wants
on
independent
expenditures
to
try
to
advance
the
interest
of
those
candidates
or
the
interests
or
the
causes
that
those
candidates
stand
for.
mr.
mccutcheon,
for
example,
can
spend
as
much
of
his
considerable
fortune
as
he
wants
on
independent
expenditure
advocating
the
election
of
these
candidates.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
foundation--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
do
think
we
have
limits
on
contributions
to
political
parties
in
addition
to
limits
on
contributions
to
candidates.
and
i
think
that
does
help
establish
the
point
here,
which
is
that
candidates
are
not
hermetically
sealed
off
from
each
other,
and
parties
are
not
hermetically
sealed
off
from
candidates.
they
--
you
know,
they're
all
on
the
same
team.
and
we
limit
the
amount
that
an
--
an
individual
can
contribute
to
a
political
party
as
well
as
the
amount
that
an
individual
can
contribute
to
candidates.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
let
me
try
to
answer
this
with
an
analogy,
if
i
could,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
the
right
way
to
think
about
it
is
this:
if
somebody
thinks
the
secretary
of
defense
is
doing
a
great
job,
they
can
take
out
an
ad
in
the
washington
post,
spend
$500,000
on
that
ad
saying:
the
secretary
of
defense
has
done
a
great
job.
and
--
and
they
would
have
an
undoubted
first
amendment
right
to
do
that.
no
one
could
think
that
there's
a
content
--
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
content-neutral
justification
for
prohibiting
that
speech.
but
if
instead
the
person
wanted
to
express
their
symbolic--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
still
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
would
be
an
independent
expression.
but
if,
instead,
somebody
wanted
to
express
symbolically
their
view
that
the
secretary
of
defense
has
done
a
great
job
by
giving
the
secretary
of
defense
a
maserati,
nobody
would
think
that
there
was
a
first
amendment
ground
that
could
be
--
that
could
be
invoked.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
--
yes,
it
is,
but
the
point--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
--
it
get
--
i
think
it
does,
if
i
may,
justice
alito,
because
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
the
--
that
the
rule
against
gifts,
the
conflict
of
interest
rules,
they
exist
to
advance
a
content-neutral
government
interest
of
the
highest
importance.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
but
i
think
there
are
two
--
justice
alito,
i
think
that,
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
the
point
your
honor
is
making
confuses
two
different
ways
in
which
these
laws
combat
the
risk
of
corruption.
the
first
one
is
that
the
--
the
handing
over
of
the
large
check,
and
whether
it's
a
$3.6
million
check
for
everyone
or
a
$2.2
million
check
for
the
house
candidates
or
a
$1
million
check
for
all
the
state
committees,
the
very
--
just
as
the
court
found
in
mcconnell
with
respect
to
massive
soft
money
contributions
and
the
inherent
risks
of
--
of
corruption
there,
there's
an
inherent
risk
of
corruption.
and
that's
why
indeed,
as
i
said,
we
have
limits
on
how
much
we
can
contribute
to
a
political
party
for
that
reason--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
that's
apart
from
how
it
gets
transferred.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
way
these
joint
fundraising
committees
work
is
you
hand
over
a
single
check
to
a
candidate
who
solicits
it.
now,
it
could
be
any
candidate
who
sets
up
a
joint
fundraising
committee,
says
give
to
me
and
give
to
the
rest
of
my
team.
and
that's
--
so
the
handing
over
the
check
to
that
candidate
is
a
--
seems
to
me
creates
a
significant
risk
of
indebtedness
on
the
part
of
that
candidate,
even
though
a
lot
of
the
money
is
flowing
through
to
others.
in
addition,
the
party
leaders
are
often
going
to
be
the
ones
who
solicit
those
contributions,
and
they're
going
to
have
a
particular
indebtedness
to
candidates
because,
of
course,
their
power,
their
authority
depends
on
the
party
retaining
or
--
or
gaining
a
majority
in
the
legislature,
and
so
they're
going
to
feel
a
particular
sense
of
indebtedness,
that
this
person
is
helping
not
only
them,
but
everybody--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--in
these
massive
amounts
and
then
--
i'm
sorry,
if
i
may
just
make
my
third
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
then
the
third
point
i
think
is
that
every,
every
candidate
in
the
party
is
going
to
be
affected
by
this,
because
every
candidate
is
going
to
get
a
slice
of
the
money
and
every
candidate
is
going
to
know
that
this
person
who
wrote
the
multimillion
dollar
check
has
helped
not
only
the
candidate,
but
the
whole
team,
and
that
creates
a
particular
sense
of
indebtedness.
and,
of
course,
every
member
of
the
party
is
likely
to
--
every
--
every
officeholder
in
the
party
is
likely
to
be
leaned
on
by
the
party
leadership
to
deliver
legislation
to
the
people
who
are
buttering
their
bread.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so,
you
know,
i
think
that
that
--
i
think
it's
possible,
but
i
think
if
somebody
had
that
goal,
that
circumvention
goal,
but
by
far
better
ways
of
achieving
it
would
be
giving
significant
--
and
you've
taken
the
aggregate
caps
off
--
would
be
making
significant
contributions
to
state
parties
and
national
parties
who
are
free
to
transfer
money
among
themselves
without
restriction,
and
by
--
and
by
making
contributions
to
pacs.
and
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
--
first
of
all,
i
think
it
could
happen
in
that
situation,
but
i
think
it's
more
likely
to
happen
in
those--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
--
well,
i
--
in
mcconnell
and
in
colorado
republican
to
this
court
said
that
earmarking
is
not
the
outer
limit
of
the
government's
authority
to
regulate
here.
and
the
reason
the
court
said
that
is
because
a
lot
of
this
can
be
done
with
winks
and
nods
and
subtly.
and
so
i
--
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
the
case
that
earmarking
would
work
to
prohibit
that.
but
i
also
think
that
the
--
when
we're
talking
about
aggregate
limits,
they're
part
of
an
overall
system
of
regulation.
and
i
think
that
they
work
to
keep
the
--
to
keep
the
circumvention
risk
in
check,
and
they
work
to
make
sure
that
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
problem
that
you
identified
in
mcconnell.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
the
statute
can
be
upheld
under
the
current
state
of
the
record.
i
understand
and
take
your
honor's
point.
but
i
do
think
that
you
had
a
substantial
record
in
buckley,
you
had
a
substantial
record
in
mcconnell,
but
that
substantial
record
bears
directly
on
the
question
of
whether
massive
aggregate
contributions
pose
the
inherent
danger
of
corruption
and
the
corrosive
appearance
of
corruption
and
that
the
case
can
be
decided
on
that
basis.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
the
--
we
take
the
constitutional
first
amendment
framework
of
this
court's
decisions
as
a
given.
the
court
has
--
the
court
has
determined
that
independent
expenditures
do
not
present
a
risk
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
that
allows
their
regulation;
that
contributions
--
direct
contributions
to
candidates
and
to
parties
can
pose
that
risk--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--so
i
think
the
answer
is
we
don't
know
one
way
or
another
whether
that's
the
consequence,
but
we--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
--
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
we
do.
the
parties
still
raise
and
spend
very
substantial
amounts
of
money,
and
so
i
don't
think
that
--
that
we
know.
but
beyond
that,
what
--
the
congress
has
made
a
determination
that
there
is
a
real
risk
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
here,
and
has
regulated
with
respect
to
that
risk,
and
congress
is
of
course
free
to
take
this
into
consideration.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that's
a
good
point,
justice
scalia.
i
think
it
helps
illustrate--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
do,
i
do.
take
the
2010
election.
it's
a
non-presidential
year.
each
party
spent
--
parties
and
candidates
together
on
each
side
spent
approximately
$1.5
billion.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
--
that
i
don't
have
specifics
for,
but
if
that
were--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
--
but
the
parties
--
but
here's
the
problem--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
the
right
way
to
look
at
it,
your
honor.
if
you
think
that
a
party's
got
to
get
$1.5
billion
together
to
run
a
congressional
campaign,
parties
and
candidates
together,
and
you've
got
a
maximum
of
$3.6
million,
that
is
about
450
people
you
need
to
round
up.
less
than
500
people
can
fund
the
whole
shooting
match.
and
that
i
think
is
part
of
the
problem
here,
is
that
you
are
going
to
create
a
situation,
if
you
take
off
of
the
aggregate
limits,
in
which
there
is
a
very
real
risk
that
--
that
both
--
that
the
government
will
be
run
of,
by,
and
for
those
500
people
and
that
the
public
will
perceive
that
the
government
is
being
run
of,
by,
and
for
those
500
people.
and
that
is
why
we
have
these
aggregate
limits
and
why
they
need
to
remain
in
place.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
take
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
right
--
you
asked
earlier
about
the
right
analytical
framework.
i
think
the
right
analytical
framework
under
the
first
amendment
is
to
think
about
this
in
terms
of
content
neutrality.
the
government's
interest
in
preventing
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption,
which
is
why
i
brought
up
the
example
of
the
maserati
to
the
secretary
of
defense,
is
an
entirely
content-neutral
justification--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
would
think
that
would
be
a
content-based
justification
because
the
--
you
are
not
--
you
are
not
trying
to
prevent
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption
by
doing
that,
and
there
is
no
other
neutral
justification
that
i
can
think
of
for
why
you
would
impose
such
a
rule.
but
the
point
is,
with
respect
to
elected
officials
and
the
giving
of
money
to
the
elected
officials,
there
is
this
content-neutral
justification
that
just
doesn't
exist
with
respect
to
any
other
entity
out
there
in
the
world.
and,
yes,
it
is
not
free
of
first
amendment
costs
and
we
acknowledge
that,
but
--
but
that
cost
is
mitigated
in
that
this
is
not
a
prohibition,
that
you
can
--
you
can't
make
it
at
the
maximum,
but
you
can
make
less.
and
then
you
have
all
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
suppose
you
could
try
to
calculate
an
aggregate
contribution
limit
that
is
different
and
higher
than
the
one
that
is
here
now,
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
the
appellants
are
not
making
that
argument.
they're
making
the
argument
that
you
cannot
have
--
the
only
argument
they've
made
in
this
case
is
that
you
cannot
have
aggregate
limits
because
base
contribution
limits
do
all
the
work.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so,
again,
i
apologize
for
repeating
myself,
justice
alito,
but
circumvention
is
not
the
only
problem.
the
delivery
of
the
--
the
solicitation
and
receipt
of
these
very
large
checks
is
a
problem,
a
direct
corruption
problem,
and
none
of
the
alternatives
that
the
appellant's
have
identified
address
that
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
they're
not
--
they
are
not
going
to
burn
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
--
but
--
and
that's
the
point.
they're
not
going
to
burn
it.
they
need
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
--
i
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
i
think
what
it
does
is
create
the
sense
of
indebtedness
on
the
part
of
the
recipient
and
on
a
part
of
the
party
leadership
when
it's
delivered,
and
--
and
that's
the
inherent
risks
of
corruption
in
that
situation.
it's
--
it's
quite
parallel
to
mcconnell.
it's
why
we
have
aggregate
limits
on
what
you
can
give
to
a
party
because
these
people
are
not
hermetically
sealed
off
from
each
other.
they
are
all
on
the
same
team.
they
all
have
an
interest
in
each
other's
success.
and
so
party
leaders
in
particular
are
going
to
feel
a
sense
of
indebtedness,
and
their
less
restrictive
alternatives
don't
deal
with
that.
but
now
going
--
if
i
could,
i
will
try
to
address
the
circumvention
problem.
you
know,
they
--
what
they
have
done
is
come
up
with
a
whole
series
of
things
that
you
would
have
to
--
there
is
not
one
thing
that
you
would
have
to
do
to
take
care
of
this
problem.
you
would
have
to
say
no
transfer.
you
would
have
to
say
segregated
accounts.
you
would
have
to
say
no
giving
money
to
pacs
who
have
indicated
that
they
are
going
to
give
money
to
candidates
once
you
have
already
given
money.
you're
going
to
have
to
do
five
or
six
things
to
deal
with
the
risks
of
corruption.
the
idea
that
that
is
a
less-restrictive
means,
it
seems
to
me
like
a
significantly
more
restrictive
means,
and
it's
going
to
impose
first
amendment
costs
of
its
own.
i'm
sure
the
pacs
are
going
to
say:
what
do
you
mean
we
can't
say
who
we
want
to
give
money
to;
we
have
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
here
to
debate
the
question
of
whether
the
court's
jurisprudence
is
correct
with
respect
to
the
risks
of
corruption
from
independent
expenditures.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
we
accept
it
and
--
and
the
line
is
that
there
--
in
this
court's
jurisprudence,
that
there
is
an
unacceptable
risk
when
contributions
are
too
high.
and
if
i
may
just
say
this
in
conclusion--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
--
well--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--congress
isn't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
--
the
risk
--
we
--
we
think
the
risk
of
corruption
is
real.
and
we
think
it's
in
fact
profound
when
you
are
talking
about
the
kinds
of
contributions
that
can
be
made
if
you
take
--
you
take
the
lid
off
on
aggregate
contributions.
if
it
--
if
justice
scalia's
critique
of
the
situation
proves
correct
and
it
is
deeply
disabling
to
candidates
and
parties,
congress
can
address
that
by
changing
the
contribution
limits.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
suggest
that
you
don't,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
--
well,
i
think
with
respect
to
mcconnell,
this
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
is
really
a
very
close
parallel.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
i
think
the
record
--
you
know,
after
all,
these
aggregate
limits
were
enacted
in
bcra,
the
same
statute
that
--
to
which
that
legislative
record
pertains
and
it
really
does
go
to
the
same
problem.
and,
therefore,
i
think
it
bears
upon
it
and
it's
--
it's
ample
evidence
that
would
justify
upholding
these
aggregate
limits,
and
i
would
strongly
urge
the
court
to
do
so.
thank
you.
