ms.
murphy,
on
the
“
everyone
else
”,
can
you
give
us
an
idea
of
whose
expression
is
at
stake?
i
mean,
most
people
couldn't
come
even
near
the
limit.
so
what
percentage
--
is
there
any
information
on
what
percentage
of
all
contributors
are
able
to
contribute
over
the
aggregate?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
burchfield,
i'd
like
you
to
address
this
question
about
the
restriction
on
speech.
it
has
been
argued
that
these
limits
promote
expression,
promote
democratic
participation,
because
what
they
require
the
candidate
to
do
is,
instead
of
concentrating
fundraising
on
the
super-affluent,
the
candidate
would
then
have
to
try
to
raise
money
more
broadly
in
the
electorate.
so
that
by
having
these
limits
you
are
promoting
democratic
participation,
then
the
little
people
will
count
some,
and
you
won't
have
the
super-affluent
as
the
speakers
that
will
control
the
elections.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
worked
out
that
way
in
practice?
has
it
worked
out?
because
there
was
one
brief
at
least
saying
no,
that
--
that
that's
wrong.
in
fact,
it's
the
challengers
who
are
aided.
justice
ruth
bader

but
he
can
--
he
can
write
checks
to
everyone
that
he
wants
to
write
checks
to.
it's
just
he
can't
give
his
special
number
of
1776.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
his
own
case,
it
would
be
something
over
$1,000,
right?
because
he
identified
12
more
candidates
that
he'd
like
to
give
1776
to.
but
he
could
give
each
of
them
over
$1,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
the
government
in
the
proceeding
below
didn't
suggest
in
response
to
the
--
to
the
proceedings
before
the
three-judge
court
that
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
--
both
sides
seem
to
treat
this
as
a
matter
that
could
be
disposed
of
without
an
evidentiary
hearing;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
the
point
that
the
chief
made
about
what
this
does
is
limit
particularly
on
the
national
strategy.
it
drives
contributions
towards
the
pacs
and
away
from
the
parties,
that
money
--
without
these
limits,
the
money
would
flow
to
the
candidate,
to
the
party
organization,
but
now,
instead,
it's
going
to
the
pacs.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
