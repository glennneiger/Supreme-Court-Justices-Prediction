chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-536,
mccutcheon
v.
the
federal
election
commission.
ms.
murphy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
murphy,
we
haven't
talked
yet
about
the
effect
of
the
aggregate
limits
on
the
ability
of
donors
to
give
the
minimum
amount
to
as
many
candidates
as
they
want.
the
effect
of
the
aggregate
limits
is
to
limit
someone's
contribution
of
the
maximum
amount
to
about
9
candidates,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
way
to
eliminate
that
aspect
while
retaining
some
of
the
aggregate
limits?
in
other
words,
is
that
a
necessary
consequence
of
any
way
you
have
aggregate
limits?
or
are
there
alternative
ways
of
enforcing
the
aggregate
limitation
that
don't
have
that
consequence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
burchfield.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
because
they
can
transfer
the
funds
among
themselves
and
to
a
particular
candidate.
is
the
possibility
of
prohibiting
those
transfers
perhaps
a
way
of
protecting
against
that
corruption
appearance
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
an
individual
to
contribute
to
however
many
house
candidates
he
wants
to
contribute
to?
i
mean,
the
concern
is
you
have
somebody
who
is
very
interested,
say,
in
environmental
regulation,
and
very
interested
in
gun
control.
the
current
system,
the
way
the
anti-aggregation
system
works,
is
he's
got
to
choose.
is
he
going
to
express
his
belief
in
environmental
regulation
by
donating
to
more
than
nine
people
there?
or
is
he
going
to
choose
the
gun
control
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
framework
--
what
is
the
framework
for
analyzing
--
i
agree
with
you
on
the
aggregation,
but
it
has
this
consequence
with
respect
to
limiting
how
many
candidates
an
individual
can
support
within
the
limits
that
congress
has
said
don't
present
any
danger
of
corruption?
so
what
is
the
framework
for
analyzing
that?
give
you
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
transfers
and
the
appearance
there,
but
it
does
have
that
other
consequence
on
something
we've
recognized
as
a
significant
right.
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
--
the
consequence
is
--
just
to
get
back
to
my
prior
question,
the
consequence
is
you
are
telling
somebody
who
doesn't
want
to
give
3.4
million
but
wants
to
contribute
to
more
than
nine
house
candidates,
just
up
to
the
maximum,
which
would
be
the
$5,000
per
the
double
cycle,
you
are
telling
him
that
he
can't
make
that
contribution,
however
modest,
certainly
within
the
limits
congress
has
said
does
not
present
the
problem
of
corruption,
to
a
tenth
candidate.
i
appreciate
the
argument
you
are
making
about
the
3-point-whatever
million-dollar
check
and
the
need
for
the
aggregate
limits
to
address
that.
i
understand
that
point.
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
flip
side?
i
mean,
you
can't
pretend
that
that
is
pursued
with
no
first
amendment
cost
quite
apart
from
the
one
that's
there.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
direct
restriction
on
much
smaller
contributions
that
congress
said
do
not
present
a
problem
with
corruption.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
that
wouldn't
--
doesn't
normally
get
you
very
far
on
the
first
amendment.
you
could
not
have
a
rule
that
says
the
--
the
post
or
the
new
york
times
can
only
endorse
nine
candidates--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
--
i
mean,
it's
completely
content
neutral;
you
don't
care
who
the
tenth
is.
but
that
--
that
limit
would
not
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
there
--
is
there
any
way
to
prevent
the
concern
you
have
about
the
3-point-whatever-it-is
million-dollar
check
without
imposing
the
limit
on
the
person
who
wants
to
support
ten
candidates
rather
than
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
all
right.
but
--
so
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
general.
ms.
murphy,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
