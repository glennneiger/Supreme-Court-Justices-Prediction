mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
senator
mcconnell
agrees
that
this
aggregate
limit
does
not
pass
exacting
scrutiny.
senator
mcconnell
believes
that
all
restrictions
of
this
nature
should
be
reviewed
under
strict
scrutiny.
to
begin
with,
this
is
a
severe
restriction
on
political
speech.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that,
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
this
limit,
the
aggregate
limit
on
political
parties,
places
like-minded
political
parties
in
the
position
of
competing
against
each
other
rather
than
collaborating
against
each
other.
all
the
national
political
parties
on
the
republican
side
and
the
state
political
parties
compete
against
each
other
for
an
artificially
limited
pool
of
money
from
each
contributor.
the
same
is
true
on
the
candidate
side.
they
compete
against
each
other
for
the
same
artificially
limited
pool
of
money,
even
though
each
individual
contribution
to
the
candidate
or
to
the
party
is
limited
by
the
base
limits.
the
federal
election
commission
regulations
--
and
justice
breyer,
i
would
--
i
would
propose
that
you
look
at
section
110.1(h),
which
specifically
--
which
specifically
prohibits
a
pac
of
the
nature
you
describe.
if
a
person
contributes
to
a
pac
with
knowledge
his
contribution
is
going
to
a
particular
candidate,
that
is
an
earmark
under
the
--
under
the
precedents
of
the
federal
election
commission.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
it
is,
your
honor,
particularly
in
the
current
environment
where
the
national
political
parties
are
--
are
being
marginalized
by
outside
forces.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
let
me
see
you
and
raise
you
one.
there
are
separate
limits
here,
your
honor,
for
candidates
and
for
political
parties.
the
effect
of
this
is
to
insulate
the
incumbents
from
competing
with
the
political
parties
for
the
dollars.
and
by
imposing
a
cap
on
the
candidate
--
on
the
amount
candidates
can
raise,
the
incumbents
realized
that
they're
the
favored
class
among
--
among
candidates
who
are
going
to
be
getting
the
contributions.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
--
it
is
--
there's
a
hard
cap
on
the
number
any
contributor
can
give
to
all
candidates,
and
a
separate
cap
on
the
amount
that
contributor
can
give
to
all
party
committees.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
your
--
your
honor,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
as
an
as-applied
challenge.
mr.
mccutcheon
does
not
want
to
go
through
--
does
not
want
to
go
through
the
committees
you're
talking
about.
he
wants
to
write
checks
directly
to
the
candidates
and
directly
to
the
committees.
he
is
constrained
by
the
aggregate
limit.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
if
--
if
he
wanted
to
give
a
contribution
to
every
candidate
running
for
a
federal
congressional
seat,
congressional
and
senate,
he
would
be
limited
to
$86
or
some
number
like
that.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
he
could.
but
again,
you're
--
you're
diminishing
his
right
to
associate
and
the
intensity
of
his
association
by
applying
this
aggregate
limit.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
no.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
absolutely
not,
because
mcconnell
dealt
with
the
situations
where
there
were
--
you
were
not
considering
the
base
limits.
the
soft
money
by
definition
was
not
subject
to
the
base
limits.
to
take
your
example
of
the
joint
fundraising
committee,
the
joint
fundraising
regulation,
which
consumes
more
than
three
pages
in
the
--
in
the
federal
code
of
federal
regulations
--
it's
at
102.17(c)
--
it
specifically
reaffirms
the
base
limits.
it
specifically
reaffirms
the
anti-earmarking
restriction,
and
it
says
that
the
joint
fundraising
committee
must
inform
all
contributors
of
those
restrictions.
so,
again,
it's
the
situation
where
the
money
leaves
the
contributor's
hands,
he
loses
control
over
it,
and
the
person
who
receives
it
makes
the
direction.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
well,
we
know
from
the
citizens
united
decision,
your
honor,
that
gratitude
and
influence
are
not
considered
to
be
quid
pro
quo
corruption.
so
i
think
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
that
is
not
the
sort
of
corruption
that
would
sustain
this
limit,
especially
in
light
of
the
severe
restrictions
on
speech
and
association
that
it
imposes
as
the
political
parties
compete
against
each
other
and
as
they
--
and
as
--
as
the
candidates
have
to
compete
against
each
other.
justice
alito.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
your
honor,
the
--
the
statute
has
changed
significantly
to
impose
base
limits
on
the
parties,
to
impose
--
on
both
the
state
and
--
and
federal
parties.
it
has
changed
to
prohibit
proliferation
of
political
committees.
one
of
the
concerns
in
buckley
was
the
dairy
industry,
which
contributed
to
hundreds
of
pacs
supporting
president
nixon's
re-election.
that
is
no
longer
possible.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
that's
not
--
as
i
understand
--
as
i
read
the
lower
court
decision
in
buckley,
that
is
correct.
in
addition,
you
also
have
--
you
also
have
a
thick
volume--
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
--in
addition,
you
also
have
--
you
also
have
a
thick
volume
--
you
have
a
thick
volume
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
of
the
federal
election
commission,
which
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
buckley.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
the
foundation
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
this
area
is
the
careful
line
between
independent
expenditures,
which
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
do
not
create
a
sufficient
risk
of
quid
pro
quo
corruption
to
justify
their
regulation,
and
contributions
which
do.
mr.
bobby
r.
burchfield
so
we're
not
talk--
