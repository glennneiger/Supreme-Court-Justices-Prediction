justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
all
these
were
there
at
--
but
for
one
--
were
there
at
the
time
of
buckley
vs.
valeo,
and
i
guess
the
court
thought
something
could
happen
like
the
following:
candidate
smith,
we
can
only
give
him
$2600,
but
he
has
a
lot
of
supporters.
and
each
of
them,
40
of
them
gets
a
brainstorm.
and
each
of
the
40
puts
on
the
internet
a
little
sign
that
says,
sam
smith
pac.
this
money
goes
to
people
like
sam
smith.
great
people.
now,
we
can
give
each
of
those
40
$5,000.
they
aren't
coordinated,
they're
not
established
by
a
single
person.
each
is
independently
run.
and
we
know
pretty
well
that
that
total
of
$5,000
times
40
will
go
to
sam
smith.
okay?
what
does
that
violate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
$5,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
$5,000.
so
we
all
have
is
my
$5,000
going
to
the
pac
and
there
happened
to
be
400
<pacs>
[=
pacs].
so
5,000
times
--
4,000.
five
times
40,
five
times
400,
how
much
is
that?
i'm
not
too
good
at
math.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
there
is
no
earmarking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
earmarking
requires
that
you
write
on
a
check
or
in
an
accompanying
letter
that
you
want
the
money
to
go
to
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
they'll
contribute
to
several
because
they'll
get
more
than
one
contribution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
we're
trying
to
do,
because
it's
hard
to
do
in
oral
argument.
but
what
we're
trying
to
do
in
both,
i
think,
our
cases
is
that
we
looked
up
all
the
rules
and
the
regs
--
or
my
law
clerk
did
--
and
--
and
what
she
discovered,
and
it
may
be
wrong
because
i'll
look
at
it
again,
is
there
has
been
no
significant
change
in
the
earmarking
rules,
in
any
of
the
rules
that
you're
talking
about,
but
for
one,
change
since
buckley.
the
one
change,
the
one
change
is
the
change
that
all
contributions
made
by
political
committees
established
by
or
financed
or
maintained
or
controlled
by
a
single
person
will
count
as
one.
so
what
you're
seeing
in
these
hypotheticals
is
simply
the
construction
of
precisely
the
same
situation
that
existed
in
buckley
while
being
careful
to
have
not
one
person
control
the
4,000
pacs,
which
is
pretty
easy
to
do.
and
if
you
want
to
say,
is
this
a
reality?
turn
on
your
television
set
or
internet.
because
we
found
instances,
without
naming
names,
where
it
certainly
is
a
reality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
is
the
actual
ad,
the
actual
ad.
i
won't
name
the
candidate.
you
see
a
picture
of
the
candidate.
there
is
a
sign
that
says
“
smith
pac
”.
that's
what
it
says.
and
then
it
says,
"make
a
donation
to
help
smith
pac
support
republican.
"
if
you
like,
or
“
democratic
candidates
”.
period.
and
then
they
have
an
address.
all
right.
now,
it
doesn't
take
a
genius
to
figure
out
what
they're
going
to
do
with
the
money
and
that
maybe
smith
will
get
a
pretty
good
share
of
it.
now,
if
smith
has
400
people
who
figure
this
out,
he
will
have
400
times
5,000
times
one
person.
now,
you
say
that
really
couldn't
happen
because
of
the
designation.
we
haven't
found
a
designation
rule
that
would
stop
it.
but
then
justice
sotomayor
is
saying:
i
don't
know.
and
i
don't
either,
because
there's
been
no
hearing,
there's
been
no
evidence
presented.
there
is
nothing
but
dismissal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
so
i
read
in
one
summer
before
bcra,
i
spent
several
weeks
reading
the
record
before
the
district
court
in
that
very
lengthy
case
on
this.
and
it
was
filled
with
testimony
by
senators
and
congressmen
that
a
handful
of
people
can
give
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
they
know
who
those
people
are,
and
that
those
people
do
have
undue
influence,
which
means
in
first
amendment
terms
that
the
individual
who,
in
fact,
has
wonderful
ideas
and
convinces
others,
even
by
paying
three
cents
to
buy
the
internet
or
something,
hasn't
a
shot
because
it
will
influence
people,
not
ideas,
but
the
money.
now,
there
was
a
record
on
that.
here
there
is
no
record
showing
whether
this
aspect
does
or
does
not
have
the
same
tendency.
that
is
why
i
ask:
how
can
i
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
theory
when
the
record
previously
showed
the
contrary
of
what's
been
argued,
and
in
fact
at
least
might
show
that
even
in
respect
to
these
limits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
actually
does
very
much
--
while
i
don't
--
i'm
looking
for
an
answer
here.
it's
not
that
i
have
one
at
all.
it
is
rather
basic,
the
point
i
think
that's
being
made
now.
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it,
the
whole
reason
--
it
is
no
doubt
that
campaign
limits
take
an
ordinary
person
and
they
say:
you
cannot
give
more
than
such-and-such
an
amount.
there
are
apparently,
from
the
internet,
200
people
in
the
united
states
who
would
like
to
give
$117,000
or
more.
we're
telling
them:
you
can't;
you
can't
support
your
beliefs.
that
is
a
first
amendment
negative.
but
that
tends
to
be
justified
on
the
other
side
by
the
first
amendment
positive,
because
if
the
average
person
thinks
that
what
he
says
exercising
his
first
amendment
rights
just
can't
have
an
impact
through
public
opinion
upon
his
representative,
he
says:
what
is
the
point
of
the
first
amendment?
and
that's
a
first
amendment
point.
all
right.
so
that's
basic,
i
think.
now,
once
that's
so,
congress
has
leeway.
and
you
are
saying,
and
i
have
seen
all
over
the
place,
that
that's
why
we
don't
want
those
200
people
to
spend
more
than
117
or
120,000
because
the
average
person
thinks
the
election
is
--
after
the
election
all
the
actions
are
affected
by
the
pocketbook
and
not
by
the
merits
of
the
first
amendment
arguments.
okay.
and
now
you
say
the
person
can
do
the
same
thing
anyway;
just
call
it
independent.
and
what
independent
does,
he
can
spend
40
million.
he
can
spend
50
million.
and
all
that
does
is
sort
of
mix
up
the
messages
because
the
parties
can't
control
it.
now,
that's,
i
think,
the
question
that's
being
asked.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
serious
question,
and
i'd
like
to
know
what
flows
from
it.
is
it
true?
so
what?
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
what
is
your
opinion
about
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
would
you
think?
i
was
just
listening
to
your
dialogue,
and
you
heard
--
this
is
pretty
tough,
we
try
to
construct
some
hypotheticals,
and
--
and
the
counsel
says,
oh,
i've
got
this
part
wrong
or
that
part
wrong
or
the
other
one,
and
they
may
be
right.
and
we
can't
do
this,
figuring
out
all
these
factual
things
in
an
hour,
frankly.
and
they
may
be
right;
i'm
not
sure.
there
hasn't
been
a
full
hearing.
it
seemed
to
me
there
are
things
to
explore
in
respect
to
the
circumvention.
who
is
right?
should
you
change
the
hypothetical
slightly,
or
what?
there
are
things
to
explore
in
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
being
able
to
write
a
$3.6
million
check
to
a
lot
of
people
does
leave
the
average
person
to
think,
my
first
amendment
speech
in
terms
of
influencing
my
representative
means
nothing.
there
are
things
to
explore
in
terms
of
the
relationship
between
what
is
permissible;
namely,
spend
$40
million
independently.
and
what
isn't
permissible;
namely,
spending
more
than
117,000.
none
of
these
have
been
considered.
they
would
seem
relevant.
so
what
do
you
think
about
going
into
these
matters
in
a
district
court
where
the
evidentiary
aspects
of
them
can
be
explored
at
some
length?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it's
interrelated.
but
the
--
the
record,
as
far
as
i
recall
it
from
several
years
ago,
talked
about
at
length:
i
don't
like
to
use
the
word
“
corrupting
”;
i
like
to
use
integration,
“
integrity
of
the
process
”,
that
notion
of
getting
people
to
think
that
their
first
amendment
speech
makes
a
difference,
etcetera.
let's
say
“
corruption
”.
mostly
when
it
got
to
this
part,
the
aggregate,
it
was
about
circumvention.
and
i
think
you
are
quite
right
to
say:
but
there
is
a
huge
corruption
aspect
to
this.
but
we
don't
have
a
lot
of
information
in
the
record
about
that,
do
we?
if
i
just
--
did
i
just
miss
it?
did
i
miss
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
a
close
parallel
when
i
think
about
it,
maybe
--
or
you
think
about
it,
but
if
you're
really
talking
--
they
don't
think
about
it
that
way.
and
so
that's
why
i've
been
pushing
this
idea,
you
see,
of
let's
go
into
this,
okay?
if
they
want
us
to
go
into
it,
go
into
it.
