justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
be
clear
what
your
answer
to
justice
kagan
was,
her
hypothetical.
is
--
is
part
of
your
answer
that
this
might
--
the
hypothetical
that
she
gives
--
contravene
earmarking?
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
is
part
of
your
answer
to
her
there
that
the
hypothetical
isn't
real
or
isn't
going
to
happen
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
can't
happen
under
the
existing
law?
is
that
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
other
side
concede
that
this
is
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
--
suppose
a
number
of
pacs
--
i
forget
the
number
in
justice
kagan's
example
--
said
we're
going
to
give
to
congressional
and
senatorial
candidates
who
want
to
cut
down
on
governmental
spending.
and
we
know
there's
only
about
four
people
that
are
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
have
the
same
question.
you
have
two
--
two
persons.
one
person
gives
an
amount
to
a
candidate
that's
limited.
the
other
takes
out
ads,
uncoordinated,
just
all
on
his
own,
costing
$500,000.
don't
you
think
that
second
person
has
more
access
to
the
candidate
who's
--
when
the
candidate
is
successful,
than
the
first?
i
think
that
was
at
the
root
of
justice
scalia's
question
and
justice
breyer's.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
but
so
your
answer
to
the
questions
that
have
been
put
previously
from
--
from
me
and
justice
breyer
and
justice
scalia
is
that's
the
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that's
--
just
to
be
fair,
that's
--
i'm
--
i'm
coming
--
i'm
coming
off
the
bench--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
the
understanding
that
your
answer
is:
buckley
has
settled
that
issue;
no
more
discussion
necessary.
