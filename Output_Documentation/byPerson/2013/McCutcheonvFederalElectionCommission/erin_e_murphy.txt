ms.
erin
e.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
bicker's
aggregate
contribution
limits
are
an
impermissible
attempt
to
equalize
the
relative
ability
of
individuals
to
participate
in
the
political
process.
by
prohibiting
contributions
that
are
within
the
modest
base
limits
congress
has
already
imposed
to
combat
the
reality
or
appearance
of
corruption,
these
limits
simply
seek
to
prevent
individuals
from
engaging
in
too
much
first
amendment
activity.
these
limits
cannot
be
justified
on
circumvention
grounds
because
the
concerns
the
government
hypothesizes
are
already
addressed
by
bicker's
multitude
of
more
direct
anti-circumvention
measures.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
because
bicker
imposes
numerous
direct
circumvention
measures.
for
instance,
we
have
earmarking
provisions
on
earmarking
contributions
for
candidate.
we
have
coordination
restrictions
on
coordinated
expenditures
with
a
candidate.
there
are
proliferation
restrictions
on
creating
multiple
pacs
that
are
all
designed.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
well,
there's
a
couple
problems
with
that
hypothetical,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
are
base
limits
both
on
what
can
be
given
to
a
pac--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--and
on
what
a
pac
can
give
to
a
candidate.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
without
doing
the
math,
i
will
tell
you
that
earmarking
and
proliferation
restrictions--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--but
--
but
there's--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--but
actually
it
does
not.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
earmarking
--
the
fec's
earmarking
regulations
are
broader
than
that.
if
you
have
a
pac
that
is
going
to
contribute
only
to
one
candidate,
you're
not--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--and
at
that
point,
then
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
traceability
you're
talking
about
because
there
is
more
money
coming
into
the
pac
than
can
find
its
way
to
any
one
particular
candidate.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
that's
--
that's
exactly
my
point.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
a
couple
of
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
i
mean,
first
of
all,
we're
talking
about
scenarios
where
there
isn't
coordination
at
all
between
the
first
person
who
makes
a
contribution
and
the
candidate
later
on
that's
receiving
it.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
but
they're
not
actually
donors
to
him
at
that
point.
they're
contributing
to
a
pac
that,
in
your
hypothetical,
is
contributing
to
multiple
different
candidates
and--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--i
don't
think
it
works
to
think
of
these
as
direct
contributions
in
excess
of
the
base
limits
because
the
pac
is
limited
itself
in
how
much
it
can
contribute,
so
you
would
have
to
have--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--two
responses.
there
are
changes
in
earmarking,
more
than
what
you've
suggested
because
the
restrictions
that
the
fec
has
put
out
in
regulations
are
--
are
--
they
cover
more
than
the
statute
itself.
and
specifically,
they
cover
these
instances
of
a
pac
that
is
only
going
to
be
contributing
to
one
candidate,
which
is
where
a
lot
of
the
concern
comes
from.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
that's
part
--
it
can
pose
both
earmarking
concerns
and
proliferation
concerns
if
we're
talking
about
something.
and
if
we're
talking
about
a
pac
that's--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--yes,
i
think--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--that's
part
of
the
answer.
i
don't
think
it's
a
particularly
realistic
scenario
under
existing
regulations.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
i
--
i
doubt
they
would
concede
that
it's
true.
but,
you
know,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
it,
if
you
have
a
bunch
of
pacs
that
are
getting
contributions
from
this
same
group
of
individuals,
you
are
going
to
run
into
earmarking
and
proliferation
restrictions.
but
the
other
thing
i
would
say--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--exactly.
it's
an
earmarking
restrictions
if
you
know
that
your
contributions--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
i
think
the
fec
would
be
suspicious,
but--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--well--
[laughter]
i
mean,
at
that
point,
i
think,
you
know,
that
--
that
when
you
have
a
pac
that's
not
saying
to
any
certainty
what
they're
going
to
do,
then
you
don't
--
it's
not
clear
you
have
something
to
target
there,
because
the
pac
might
be
spending
money
in
different
ways
that
are
not
operating
as
a
conduit
to
--
for
circumvention.
so,
you
know,
i
think
that
gets
again
to
why
this
doesn't
have
the
kind
of
coordination
you
need.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
that
is
not
legal,
justice
kagan.
the
candidates
do
not
have
the
ability
to
transfer
money
to
each
other.
they
only
have--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--a
candidate
can
transfer
$2,000
to
a
candidate
per
election.
and
that's
a
contribution--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--that's
a
hard
contribution
limit
on
how
much
they
can
contribute.
but
--
but
i
think
all
of
this
also
gets
to
another
problem,
which
is
there's
an
overbreadth
problem
here.
because
if
--
if
you're
talking
about
this
scenario,
in
your
scenario,
there's
only
one
person
who
can
even
make
a
contribution
at
that
point
after
the
first
$2600
is
received.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
i
think
even
if
you
accept
this
scenario
where
all
of
these
candidates
are
independently
deciding
to
give
all
their
money
to
one
candidate,
you
can't
have
a
law
that
is
designed
to
prevent
this
one
person
from
circumvention
by
prohibiting
everybody
else
from
engaging
in
contributions
that
don't--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--i
don't
have
a
percentage
on
how
many
are
able.
i
mean,
we
aren't
talking
about
a
large
number
of
individuals.
we
certainly
are
talking
about
more
individuals
than
whose
first
amendment
rights
were
implicated
by
the
provision
at
issue
in
davis,
for
example.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
absolutely
not.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
that's
right.
if
you're
talking
about
a
general--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--well,
it's
certainly
a
necessary
consequence
of
bcra's
scheme
in
which
there's
a
distinct
aggregate
limit
on
contributions
to
candidates
alone.
i
think,
though,
aggregate
limits
in
general
are
always
going
to
have
this
effect
of
prohibiting
people
from
giving
contributions
that
don't
themselves
give
rise
to
quid
pro
quo
corruption
concerns.
and
that's
why
if
the
government
is
really
concerned
about
the
things
it's
talking
about,
there
are
narrower
avenues
to
get
at
them.
if
the
concern
is
joint
fundraising
committees,
you
could
have--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--well--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--i
guess
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
talking
about
happening.
i
mean,
if
you're
just
talking
about
knowing
that
some
individuals
are
making
contributions
to
other
candidates
or
state
parties
who
are
not
going
to
share
those
contributions
with
a
particular
candidate,
then
i
don't
see
how
that
--
or
gives
rise
to
any
corruption
or
circumvention
concern.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
two
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
case
was
brief
on
cross-motion
for
injunctive
relief.
so
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
make
a
record
and
it
chose
to
treat
this
as
a
legal
case,
not
as
one
in
which--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--and
that's
my
second
point.
really,
this
is--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--and
you
shouldn't
need
one
here
either
because
these
limits
are
facially
over
and
under-inclusive.
they're
not
closely
tailored
and
evidence
can't--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--i'm
suggesting
that--
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
--even
if
the
government
could
prove
that
proposition,
there
would
still
be
an
over-and
under-breadth
problem.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
erin
e.
murphy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
quick
points.
first,
we
haven't
heard
of
the
solicitor
general
talk
that
much
about
circumvention
today,
and
i
think
that's
because
the
circumvention
argument
just
doesn't
really
work.
it's
already
addressed
by
all
of
the
multiple
prophylactic
measures
that
bicker
contains.
and
to
the
extent
those
aren't
sufficient,
there
are
much
narrower,
tailored
ways
to
get
at
this,
as
the
questions
from
justice
alito
and
the
chief
justice
pointed
out.
what
we're
really
hearing
today
is
a
corruption
argument.
but
as
the
questioning
revealed,
once
you
accept
the
corruption
theory
that
the
government
is
putting
forward
here,
there
really
isn't
a
way
to
continue
to
draw
a
line
between
independent
expenditures
and
the
$3
point
million
check
to
all
of
these
different
individuals
that
is
in
small
based
limited
amounts.
because
there's
certainly
going
to
be
just
as
much
gratitude
to
the
individual
who
spends
$3.6
million
directly
supporting
one
candidate
through
ads
on
that
candidate's
behalf.
so
what
we
really
have
is
a
system
that's
forcing
money
out
of
the
most
transparent
way
possible
to
make
contributions
which
is
directly
to
the
candidates
and
the
parties
and
the
pacs.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
