justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
may
have
an
overly
suspicious
mind,
but
i
don't
know.
if
i
saw
100
pacs
rise
up
and
all
of
them
said
exactly
the
same
thing,
we're
going
to
make
contributions
to
the
five
most
contested
senate
--
the
candidates
in
the
five
most
contested
senate
races,
i
would
be
suspicious.
and
maybe
the
fec
would
also
be
suspicious
that
they
didn't
just
all
spring
up
independently.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
buckley,
the
court
sustained
--
sustained
aggregate
limits.
what
has
changed
since
buckley?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
those
were
all
created
by
the
dairy
industry
or
by
the
nixon
campaign,
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
we
are
talking
here
about
--
we're
talking
here
about
campaign
contributions.
isn't
it
illegal
for
a
candidate
to
take
campaign
contributions
and
use
it
to
buy
a
maserati?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
how
that
really
gets
to
the
point.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
troubles
me
about
your
--
what
troubles
me
about
your
argument,
general
verrilli,
and
about
the
district
court's
opinion
is
that
what
i
see
are
wild
hypotheticals
that
are
not
obviously
plausible
or
--
and
lack,
certainly
lack
any
empirical
support.
now,
you've
--
you've
chosen
to
use
the
same
hypothetical
the
district
court
used
about
the
$3.5
million
contribution
that
would
be
--
that
could
be
given
by
a
coordinate
--
which
involves
all
of
the
house
candidates
and
all
of
the
senate
candidates
in
a
particular
year
getting
together
with
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
parties'
national
party
committees,
plus
all
of
the
state
party
committees,
and
then
--
and
that's
how
you
get
up
to
the
$3.5
million
figure;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
how
--
how
realistic
is
that?
how
realistic
is
it
that
all
of
the
state
party
committees,
for
example,
are
going
to
get
money
and
they're
all
going
to
transfer
it
to
one
candidate?
for
49
of
them,
it's
going
to
be
a
candidate
who
is
not
in
their
own
state.
and
there
are
virtually
no
instances
of
state
party
committees
contributing
to
candidates
from
another
state.
and
the
other
part
of
it
that
seems
dubious
on
its
face
is
that
all
of
the
party
--
all
of
the
candidates
for
the
house
and
the
senate
of
a
particular
party
are
going
to
get
together
and
they
are
going
to
transfer
money
to
one
candidate.
there
really
--
you
cited
in
your
brief
the
example
--
best
examples,
i
take
it,
of
--
of
contributions
from
some
candidates
to
other
candidates.
they
are
very
small.
isn't
that
true?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--unless
the
money
is
transferred
to
--
you
have
to
get
it
from
the
person
who
wants
to
corrupt
to
the
person
who
is
going
to
be
corrupted.
and
unless
the
money
can
make
it
from
a
to
b,
i
don't
see
where
the
quid
pro
quo
argument
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--these
--
these
aggregate
limits
might
not
all
stand
or
fall
together.
let
--
just
take
this
example,
if
you
can
just
take
a
minute
and
walk
me
through
this
step
by
step.
you
have
somebody
who
wants
to
corrupt
a
member
of
the
house,
and
this
person's
strategy
is
to
make
contributions
to
multiple
house
candidates
with
the
hope,
the
expectation,
the
plan
that
those
candidates
are
going
to
transfer
--
transfer
the
money
to
the
--
the
member
that
this
person
wants
to
corrupt.
now,
how
is
that
person
going
to
accomplish
that
given
the
earmarking
regulations,
and
--
and
the
limits
on
how
much
one
member
can
contribute
to
another?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you're
--
i
mean,
if
you're
not
going
to
defend
the
application
of
the
aggregate
limits
in
that
situation,
doesn't
it
follow
that,
as
applied
to
that
situation,
these
are
--
these
are
unconstitutional?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
then
just
explain
to
me
how
it's
going
to
be
done.
the
person
gives
to
member
a
with
the
hope
that
member
a
is
going
to
give
it
to
member
b.
if
the
person
even
implies,
when
making
the
contribution
to
a,
that
person
wants
it
to
go
to
b,
that's
earmarked.
so
how
is
this
going
to
be
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
are
making
--
they
are
making
the
argument
that
there
are
--
that
the
regulations
that
already
exist
about
transfers
from
one
entity
to
another
prevent
a
lot
of
what
you're
complaining
--
what
you're
--
what
you
are
worried
about.
but
if
they
are
not
sufficient,
they
could
be
bolstered.
the
aggregate
limits
are
a
very
blunt
way
of
trying
to
get
out
--
get
at
the
problem
that
you
are
--
that
you
are
worried
about.
that's
their
argument.
what
--
are
--
is
that
wrong?
there
is
nothing
more
that
could
be
done
to
prevent
transfers
from
joint
fundraising
committees
or
from
one
member
to
another
or
from
state
parties
to
candidates?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
just
don't
understand
that.
you
mean
at
the
time
when
the
person
sends
the
money
to
this
hypothetical
joint
fundraising
committee
there
is
a
corruption
problem
immediately,
even
though
--
what
if
they
just
took
the
money
and
they
burned
it?
that
would
be
a
corruption
problem
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
does
the
corruption
--
yes.
when
does
the
corruption
occur?
it
occurs
when
it's
transferred
to
--
to
the
person
who
has
power
and
want
--
and
they
want
to
corrupt.
