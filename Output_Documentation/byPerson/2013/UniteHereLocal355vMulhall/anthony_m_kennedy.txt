i
--
i
think
there's
substantial
force
to
that
argument.
but
can
we
talk
just
about
property
just
for
a
minute,
just
in
the
abstract?
isn't
it
true
that
what
you
have
might
become
property
when
you
trade
it?
if
you
take
a
picture
of
a
celebrity
on
a
street,
that's
your
right
to
do
so.
but
you
can't
sell
it.
maybe
that's
not
quite
the
--
the
right
analogy.
but
here,
what,
as
you
point
out,
is
fairly
standard
in
labor
relations,
has
been
turned
into
property,
arguably,
by
the
parties.
could
the
parties
say
that
we'll
pay
you
--
the
employer
say
we'll
pay
you
$100,000
to
get
out
of
the
recognition
agreement?
that
would
be
property
in
an
economist
sense.
now,
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
labor
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
abstract,
wouldn't
that
be
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
isn't
the
thing
that's
exchanged
for
the
money
also
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
talking
about
common
definition,
our
common
agreement
as
to
what
property
means.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
suppose
the
company
manufactures
widgets
and
the
union
says,
we'll
spend
$100,000
advertising
your
widgets
if
you
so
--
if
you
sign
the
recognition
agreement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
--
i
think
this
is
slightly
different
from
justice
kagan,
but
can
you
give
us
some
indication
of
how
often
employers
make
these
agreements?
that's
probably
a
hard
statistic
to
--
to
collect
because
there
are
so
many
variables.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
true
of
all
property
owners.
i
have
a
right
to
waive
my
right
to
exclude
you
from
the
property.
that's
--
that's
property
--
that's
a
property
right.
and
--
and
it
can
become
so
when
i
--
when
i
charge
for
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
“
thing
of
value
”
means
something
different
in
302
than
it
means
elsewhere
in
--
in
the
code?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
can
see
if
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
extort
these
benefits,
that
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
there
was
a
crime
because
there
was
a
thing
of
value,
a
thing
of
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
acknowledge
that
your
--
that
your
answer
to
justice
kagan
is
--
is
contrary
to
years
of
settled
practices
and
understandings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
this
kind
of
an
agreement
is
very
rare?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
hard
to
think
that
one
really
pays
or
lends
or
delivers,
which
is
are
statutory
words,
neutrality
of
speech.
