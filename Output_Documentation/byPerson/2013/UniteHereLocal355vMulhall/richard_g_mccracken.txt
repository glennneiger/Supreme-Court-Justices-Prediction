mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
many
employers
and
unions
find
agreements
such
as
this
useful
to
avoid
conflict
during
organizing
campaigns.
they
are
efficient.
they
avoid
the
hard
feelings
that
come
in
many
contested
organizing
campaigns
and
thereby
create
a
good
environment
for
collective
bargaining.
they
serve
the
core
objectives
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
those
being
freedom
of
contracts,
organizing
employees
for
collective
bargaining,
and
labor
peace.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yeah.
that
example
would
definitely
be
a
violation
of
section
302.
if
the
employer
gave
the
union
$100,000
to
not
organize,
that
would
be
exactly
like
the
--
case
from
1957
from
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
they
--
money
is
property.
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
the
--
this
statute
focuses
on
what
is
paid,
lent
or
delivered
by
the
employer
to--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--in
this
case,
the
all
--
the
only
thing
given
by
the
union
was
a
promise
not
to
strike,
picket
or
boycott
this
business,
to
help
supply
labor
if
the
employer
needed
it,
not
to
coerce
or
threaten
employees
in
the
course
of
the
organizing
effort
and
to
--
and
to
arbitrate
in
the
event
that
there
was
any
dispute.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
that's
what
the
employer
promised
to
give
to
the
union.
and
i
was
describing
the
things
the
union
gave
in
response--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--because
it
was
a
mutual
agreement.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it
is
so
alleged
and
there's
no
question
that
the
union
did
tell
the
employer
and
the
other
employers
that
it
would
work
to
pass
the
legislation
necessary
for
these
employers
to
get
into
business
in
the
first
place.
thereby
serving
their
interest
and
also
the
union's
interest
in
having
an
industry
and
workers
in
the
industry
to
represent.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--it
would
be
lawful
because
the
union
would
not
have
received
any
widgets.
it
would
not
have
received
any
kind
of
property
from
the
employer.
it
would
simply
have
promised
to
help
the
employer
in
business,
something
that
happens
a
great
deal
in
labor
relations.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
unquestionably.
and
this,
as
i
say,
happens
a
lot
with--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--they
are
desired
by
the
union.
that
does
not
make
them
things
of
value
that
are
paid,
lent
and
delivered
by
employers--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--and--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--the
--
there's
no
prohibition
against
the
union
paying
money
to
an
employer.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it's
only
the
other
way
around.
and
in
this
case,
the
union
spent
$100,000
of
time
of
its
staff
knocking
on
doors
exercising
its
speech
and
petition
rights
in
order
to
get
this
legislation
passed
so
that
the
employer
could
get
into
business.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it
is
not,
justice
scalia.
there
--
there's
an
article
from
the
cornell
industrial
labor
relations
department
by
eaton
and
chriskey
showing
that
these
agreements
go
back
to
the
1970s.
also
in
the
sixth
circuit's
--
the
dana
corporation
case,
you'll
see
that
there's
an
explanation
that
the
neutrality
agreement
between
dana
and
the
uaw
was
first
signed
in
1976.
so
these
go
back
quite
a
bit
further.
also,
they
really
go
back
in
a
rudimentary
way
much
further
than
that
to
the
lion
dry
goods
case,
which
was
a
--
an
agreement
with
a
non-incumbent
union
and
department
store
employers
in
cleveland
that
provided,
among
other
things,
for
access.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
the
nlrb
has
dealt
with
that
quite
a
few
times
and
takes
the
position
and
has
required
employers
to
give
equal
rights
to
both
unions.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it's
certainly
not
a
thing
of
value
in
the
sense
of
marketability,
because
the
one
union
could
not
sell
it
to
the
second
union
because
the
other
union
could
get
it
free
from
the
employer
because
the
employer
must
give
equal
rights
to
all
comers.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
the
same
article
that
i
mentioned,
justice
kagan,
shows
that
the
differential
is
between
about
--
about
67
percent
success
rate
in
nlrb
elections
and
about
a
76
percent
success
rate
under
these
agreements.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
there
are
some
things
that
are
quite
standard.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it
is
found
in
most
agreements,
neutrality
somewhat
less
so,
but
still
in
the
vast
majority
of
them.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
but
i
can
--
i
can
tell
you
from
my
experience,
if
i
may,
that
these
agreements
are
prevalent
in
the
hospitality
industry
both
in
hotels
and
casinos,
and
that
all
of
the
major
hotel
companies
have
entered
into
these
and
the
major
casino
companies
as
well.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
justice
ginsburg,
the
complaint
in
this
case
prays
for
two
different
forms
of
relief.
one
is
that
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
not
be
honored.
but
the
second
is
that
the
union
never
demand
or
request
or
receive
any
of
these
things,
that
is
neutrality,
names
and
addresses,
or
access,
regardless
of
an
agreement.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
the
relief
--
if
this
case
went
forward
and
was
found
meritorious,
the
relief
would
be
an
injunction
against
the
union
from
ever
asking
an
employer
for
--
this
employer
for
neutrality
or
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
employees
or
for
any
form
of
access
to
the
premises
and
not--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--the
--
i
believe
that
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff
has
here
is
that
an
employer
may
never
give
these
things,
whether
it's
in
an
agreement
or
not
in
an
agreement,
that
even
if
--
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
he
would,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
your
honor,
we
--
we
advocated
during
an
earlier
phase
of
this
case
that
there
was
no
standing.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
we
--
we
still
do
not
believe
that
he
has
standing,
because
there
is
no
imminent
harm
here.
the
harm
that
he
--
he
alleges
is
that
he
will
be
ultimately
forced
into
a
collective
bargaining
situation
that
he
doesn't
want.
however,
that
could
only
occur
if
the
union
succeeded
in
convincing
a
majority
of
his
co-employees
that
they
should
unionize
and
the
employer
gave
recognition
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
negotiated.
only
--
only
after
--
so
--
so
imminence
is
--
is
very
distant
here.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
we
did
not.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it
hasn't
--
it
has
been
litigated.
it's
been
--
it's
a
point
that's
been
raised
and
rejected
by
all
the
courts
to
consider
it,
largely
because
of
the
court's
--
this
court's
statement
in
atkinson
versus
sinclair
refining.
now,
it
was
dictum,
but
it
has
--
it's
something
that
has
been
accepted
by
all
of
the
courts.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it
was
not
raised
in
this
case.
instead,
standing
was
raised.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
the
court
in
the
demasse
case
in
1993
involving
whether
trust
funds
could
be
administered
by
the
judiciary,
essentially,
under
section
302(e)
assumed
the
existence
of
a
private
right
of
action.
and
the
court
decided
that
it
was
--
it
was
not
proper
for
the
courts
to
--
to
get
past
the
point
of
the
formation
of
the
trust
and
engage
in
trust
fund
administration,
but
it
was
assumed
that
the
plaintiff
had
a
right
to
sue.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it
would
qualify
both
as
a
thing
of
value
and
one
that
is
paid,
lent,
or
delivered
by
the
employer
to
the
union.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
because
the
union
really
only
had
a
right
of
access,
not
any
exclusive
possession
of
any
property,
and
only
for
the
very
limited
purpose
of
communicating
with
employees
about
their
section
7
rights.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
not
under
florida
law,
your
honor.
the
--
because
it
would
only,
at
most,
be
a
license.
no
interest
in
real
property
would
be
given.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
a
license
may
be
a
thing
of
value
that
--
that
is
paid,
lent
or
delivered.
in
this
case,
there
was
not
a
license
so
much
as
there
was
a
waiver
or
forbearance
of
the
employer's
right
to
exclude.
the
union
did
not
receive
or
accept
any
employer
property.
it
didn't--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--yes.
it
is
your
property
right,
but
the
union
did
not
obtain
your
right
to
exclude.
it
did
not
obtain
that
property
right.
it
--
it
obtained
the
right
to
be
there
to
--
not
to
any
exclusive
area,
but
your
property
right
to
exclude
remained
in
your
hands.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
may
i
reserve
my
remaining
time?
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
thank
you.
on--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
and
the
--
reading
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
is
actually
somewhat
difficult,
because
the
--
it
appears
that
the
court
suspected
that
there
must
be
something
else
in
the
picture
that
had
not
been
disclosed
and
that's
why
it
ordered
the
district
court
to
find
out
why
the
two
parties
had
cooperated
with
each
other,
despite
the
fact
that
no
one
had
alleged
anything
else
in
the
picture
besides
what
is
before
us
all
now.
the
--
so
it
seemed
that
the
court
was
puzzled
that
an
employer
would
agree
with
the
union
to
cooperate
in
this
fashion.
the
cooperation--
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
--yes.
and
the
--
the
100,000
was
not
a
cash
payment
to
anyone,
although
it
might
have
been.
it
might
have
been
a
contribution
to
a
political
action
committee
that
had
been
formed
to
advocate
for
this
initiative.
but
instead,
it
was
actually
the
union's
own
exercise
of
its
speech
and
petition
rights
as
it
campaigned
for
the
passage
of
the
initiative
that
would
allow
the
company
to
get
into
business
in
the
first
place
as
a
casino.
so,
if
the
violation
turns
on
the
union's
exercise
of
its
own
first
amendment
rights,
then
there's
a
more
severe
problem
here
than
section
302,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
mccracken
it's
a
little
different,
but
also
very
similar
to
the
promises
that
are
actually
on
the
face
of
the
memorandum
itself,
because
the
union
agrees
to
waive
its
first
amendment
rights
to
engage
in
picketing
and
boycott
activity,
as
well
as
the
employer
waiving
some
of
its
rights
with
respect
to
its
freedom
of
speech.
so
this
is
a
case
where
there
are
multiple
waivers
of
rights,
both
speech
rights
and
property
rights,
going
back
and
forth
between
the
two
parties
for
a
central,
completely
legitimate
purpose,
and
that
is,
the
employer
getting
into
business
and
the
union
getting
the
opportunity
to
organize
its
employees.
that's
all
there
is
in
this
picture,
is
the
union,
like
so
many
construction
unions
that
we
know,
advocating
in
congress
for
the
passage
of
laws
like
the
keystone
pipeline
law.
why
did
they
do
that?
they
do
it
because
they
want
the
jobs.
they
hope
that
if
they
help
the
industry
develop
a
pipeline,
that
their
members
will
work
on
those
jobs.
that
is
a
combination
of
interests
funneled
through
the
first
amendment's
protection
for
mutual
effort,
as
the
court
recognized
in
pennington,
and,
of
course,
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine
is
one
of
our
most
important
constitutional
protections.
that's
all
that
happened
in
this
case.
so
there's
nothing
nefarious
about
it.
what
--
there
is
--
there
are
some
extremely
damaging
things
that
the
respondents'
very
simplistic
argument
will
--
would
accomplish
if
it
were
adopted.
justice
kagan
referred
to
the
--
the
grievance
procedure.
well,
there's
also
arbitration
in
this
agreement,
as
well
as
in
collective
bargaining
agreements.
but
one
searches
in
vain
in
302(c)
for
any
exception
for
arbitration,
even
though
the
court
has
said
over
so
many
years
that
it
is
the
most
important
thing
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
thank
you.
