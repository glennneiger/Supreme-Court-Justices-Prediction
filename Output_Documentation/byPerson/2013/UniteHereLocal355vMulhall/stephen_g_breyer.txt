justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
but
what
is
the
--
suppose
the
employer
had
written
a
check
for
$100,000
to
the
union
and
everything
else
is
the
same.
now,
you
ask,
why
did
he
do
that?
he
said
because
they
have
to
have
the
money
so
that
they
can
run
the
organizing
campaign
along
the
lines
that
everyone
wants.
is
that
covered
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
when
i
write
the
opinion
that
says
that
is
covered,
but
the
access,
the
employer
lists,
and
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
and
the
neutrality,
those
are
not
covered
because.
$100,000
is,
but
they
aren't
because;
and
then
what
comes
after
the
“
because
”?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
we
specify
how
they're
going
to
use
it.
they're
going
to
use
it
just
the
way--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
okay.
no.
continue
with
the
because.
one,
because
money
might
be
a
go-beyond.
what's
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
covering.
as
i
understand
the
argument
it
goes
back
to
like
jurisprudence
1.
can
you
have
--
the
sign
says
no
vehicles
in
the
park.
okay?
does
that
apply
to
a
jeep
used
as
a
war
memorial?
answer,
no.
that's
been
the
law
since
the
twelfth
th
century.
you
spilled
blood
in
the
streets
of
bologna,
a
crime,
but
that's
not
applicable
to
the
barber.
all
right?
so,
here,
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
that
read
this
statute.
you
don't
have
to
get
into
a
metaphysical
argument
about
things
of
value;
rather,
those
things
which
play
a
central
role
in
the
organizing
campaign
are
things
that
are
governed
by
the
other
parts
of
the
nlrb
and
to
throw
them
in
here
--
nlra
--
and
to
throw
them
in
here
is
going
to
create
a
mess.
lists,
access,
promises
to
stay
neutral
are
central
to
many
aspects
of
organizing
campaigns,
and
there
are
no
more
within
this
statute,
this
part
of
the
thing
than
the
jeep
on
the
pedestal
is
part
of
the
no
vehicles
in
the
park.
now,
that's
what
i
understand
roughly
their
argument
to
be,
if
i've
got
it
right.
and
what
is
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
they
had
a
right.
they
didn't
say
they
had
a
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
said
was
the
kinds
of
property
or
things
of
value
are
at
issue
here
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
play
important
roles
in
organizing
campaigns.
and
we
needn't
go
further
than
that.
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
rights
to
it.
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
who
said
what
to
whom.
it's
just
that
these
kinds
of
things
are
organizing
things,
and
therefore
they're
outside
the
scope--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--just
like
the
jeep
on
the
pedestal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is
the
same,
i
think.
and
to
go
back,
i
thought
the
most
clear
statement
of
your
view
was
when
you
said
to
justice
scalia
that
if
we
don't
accept
your
interpretation,
there's
a
hole
in
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
fact,
i
think
you
said
a
big
hole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
get
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
focusing
on
the
hole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
thought
the
area
that
you're
calling
a
hole
is
an
area
where
the
national
labor
relations
act
gives
the
national
labor
relations
board
all
kinds
of
authority
to
set
rules
and
to
say
what
is
an
appropriate
practice
and
not.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
the
answer
is
yes,
and
i'm
sure
there's
some
qualification,
but
if
the
heart
of
the
answer
is
yes,
then
it's
the
contrary
that
creates
the
hole,
because
if
we
throw
those
things
which
are
central
to
the
nlra's
regulatory
power
into
this
particular
provision,
the
nlra
loses
the
power
to
say
when
they're
okay,
when
they're
not
okay,
to
make
a
thousand
qualifications.
hence,
the
nlra's
regulatory
provisions
and
this
case
are
the
jeep
on
the
pedestal
or
the
barber
in
the
street.
even
though
i
have
to
tell
you,
in
bologna
in
the
18th
century,
despite
the
exception
of
the
eighth
century,
it
did
not
mention
barbers
specifically
in
the
statute.
they
had
to
be
read
in
by
the
courts.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
