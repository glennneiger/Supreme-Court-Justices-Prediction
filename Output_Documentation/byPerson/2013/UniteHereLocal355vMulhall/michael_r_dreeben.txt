mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
302
cannot
be
read
in
isolation
from
the
remainder
of
the
labor
laws.
the
united
states
does
not
dispute
that
if
all
this
court
had
to
look
at
was
the
words
“
thing
of
value
”
in
section
302,
the
promises
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case
could
be
viewed
as
things
of
value
and,
with
a
little
bit
of
stretching
of
the
language,
could
be
viewed
as
paid,
lent,
or
delivered.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
don't,
justice
alito.
the
eleventh
circuit
did
hold
that
mulhall
had
standing
and
there
--
we
raised
a
question
of
whether
the
case
is
moot
at
the
certiorari
stage
as
a
reason
why
this
court
may
not
want
to
take
the
case.
but
we
have
not
drilled
deeply
enough
into
it
to
have
a
position
on
that
question.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
it
seems
to
have
been
accepted
historically
and,
as
my
co-counsel
mentioned,
it
was
referenced
in
dictum
by
this
court;
it's
been
accepted
by
the
lower
courts.
i
think
if
this
court
were
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
today,
section
10(e)
of
section
302(e)
of
the
statute,
which
is
on
page
11a
of
--
of
our
brief,
gives
the
district
courts
jurisdiction
to
hear
violations
of
this
case
--
of
this
statute,
and
courts
have
assumed
that
private
parties
could
invoke
that.
if
the
court
were
looking
at
that
afresh,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
reach
that
result.
but
there
is
a
lot
of
ink
on
the
page
with
respect
to
it.
the
eleventh
circuit
did
not
reach
that
issue
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
squarely
presented
here.
but
what
is
squarely
presented
here
is
whether
the
court
should
read
section
302
as
a
freestanding
provision
divorced
from
the
central
policy
of
the
labor
laws
and
the
remaining
provisions
in
the
labor
laws.
now,
as
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
under
this
statute,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
three
terms
that
are
at
issue
--
“
neutrality
”,
“
access
”,
and
“
employee
list
”
--
are
not
prohibited
by
section
302.
probably
the
best
way
to
reach
that
conclusion
is
to
determine
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
these
three
things
be
viewed
as
things
of
value
under
the
statute.
certainly,
read
in
isolation,
the
words
“
thing
of
value
”
are
very
broad.
in
other
statutes,
they
cover
intangibles.
we
would
have
no
problem
treating
the
things
here
as
things
of
value
under
statutes
or
under
302
if
that's
the
only
thing
that
existed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
think
it
is,
justice
sotomayor.
what
the
court
has
to
do
here,
as
it
did
in
the
billing
case,
is
read
multiple
statutes
together
in
order
to
harmonize
them.
and
just
as
in
billing,
the
court
said,
well,
the
antitrust
laws
literally
do
apply
here,
the
securities
underwriting
activity
could
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
the
court
looked
at
it
in
light
of
other
policies
reflected
in
the
securities
laws
and
determined
that
congress,
having
established
an
intricate
framework
for
regulation
of
the
very
same
activity
in
the
securities
laws,
would
not
have
intended
the
antitrust
laws
to
come
along
and
supplant
it.
and
here
what
you
have
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--billing
is
simply
an
application
of
this
court's
responsibility
to
divine
congress's
intent
based
on
language,
structure,
and
history
and
policy
of
the
relevant
laws.
and
here,
all
of
those
things
when
read
together
indicate
that
agreements
by
parties
to
set
the
ground
rules
for
an
organizing
campaign
do
not
constitute
prohibited
things.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
that
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
neutrality.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
two
things,
justice
breyer,
and
they're
both
equally
important.
first
of
all,
the
--
the
provision
of
money
is
useful
to
the
union
in
any
number
of
ways
and
gives
rise
to
the
dangers
of
misuse.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
can't
be
--
it
can't
be
restricted
in
that
way
because
the
origins
of
section
302
came
from--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
other
is
that
reading
the
policies
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
we
start
from
the
proposition,
which
is
undisputed
by
respondent
and
reveals
that
his
purportedly
literal
application
of
section
302
just
does
not
wash.
we
start
from
the
proposition
that
voluntary
recognition
of
a
union
is
not
only
permissible
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it's
a
favored
element
of
national
labor
policy.
the
voluntary
reconciliation
of
agreement,
of
disputes
between
labor
and
management
is
what
this
act
drives
at.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
i
could
just
finish
this
one
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
[laughter]
the
three
procedures
that
are
at
issue
here
are
all
procedures
that
are
useful
and
geared
towards
facilitating
voluntary
recognition
and
are
only
useful
for
that
purpose.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this
court
in
the
gissel
packing
case
many
years
ago
rejected
that
argument.
the
national
labors
relation
board
has
rejected
that
argument.
certainly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--card
check
agreements
are
inherently
coercive,
yes.
that
has
been
rejected.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
they're
coercive
at
all
inherently.
they
may
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
some
would
argue--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--some
would
argue
that
employers
also
have
big
guys
and
it's
very
coercive
to
have
your
employer
in
there
on
the
factory
floor
reminding
employees
daily
that
they're
very
anti-union
and
that
there
are
a
lot
of
costs
to
joining
a
union.
and
so
the
--
the
process
here
is
one
in
which,
yes,
the
parties
can
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
have
an
election.
but
this
court
in
the
gissel
packing
case,
backed
up
by
decades
of
board
law,
has
validated
that
card
check
agreements
are
perfectly
legitimate
and
may
facilitate
the
employees'
free
exercise
of
their
choice
to
have
a
union.
the
agreement
in
this
case
doesn't
recognize
the
union.
all
the
agreement
does
is
establish
a
perfectly
lawful
process,
which
respondent
concedes
would
be
a
thing
of
value,
but
he
then
has
to
carve
it
out
from
section
302,
a
voluntary
recognition
agreement.
and
the
access
that
is
given
to
the
property,
which
is
something
that
employers
lawfully
can
do
--
it's
their
property,
they
have
the
right
to
do
it
--
they
provide
it
so
that
the
employees
can
get
information
from
the
union
about
unionization.
and
the
employee
list
serves
the
same
thing.
and
these
things
--
access,
employee
list,
neutrality
--
have
been
elements
of
federal
labor
policy
for
decades.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
justice
ginsburg,
have
concluded
that
ground
rules
agreements
are
inherently
lawful.
the
eleventh
circuit
added
a
motive-based
limitation
on
it
that
responded
to
a
policy
that's
just
not
reflected
in
the
language
of
the
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
the
union's
promises
are
not
comprehended
by
section
302.
all
that's
at
issue
here
is
whether
it's
a
federal
crime
for
an
employer
to
say
to
a
union:
you
guys
want
to
organize?
i
will
let
you
come
into
my
plant
and
address
the
employees.
in
fact,
better
yet,
we
will
have
a
debate,
management
on
one
side,
union
on
the
other.
come
into
our
hall
to
do
that.
that
would
be
a
federal
crime
under
respondents'
view.
thank
you.
