justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
mr.
mulhall
have
to
face
an
imminent
threat
in
order
for
him
to
have
standing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
why
is
the
threat
imminent
at
this
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
the
threat
imminent
at
this
time?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
your
position
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
the
right
to
use
private
property
in
a
way
that
otherwise
wouldn't
be
allowed
constitute
a
thing
of
value?
suppose
the
--
what
the
employer
gave
the
union
was
a
lease
well
--
well
below
market
rate
on
property
for
use
as
the
--
as
a
union
office.
would
that
qualify
as
a
thing
of
value?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what's
the
difference
here?
there's
a
--
there's
the
use
of
--
there's
the
conveyance
of
a
certain
property
right.
why
doesn't
that
constitute
a
thing
of
value?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
it's
still
--
it's
a
lesser
property
right,
but
isn't
it
a
property
right?
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
employer
sold
to
a
catering
company
the
right
to
drive
lunch
trucks
onto
its
premises
to
sell
sandwiches
and
coffee
to
the
employees?
wouldn't
that
be
a
property
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
well,
isn't
a
license
a
thing
of
value?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
before
you
get
too
much
into
the
merits,
could
--
does
the
united
states
have
a
position
on
whether
this
case
satisfies
