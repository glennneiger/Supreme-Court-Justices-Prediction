mr.
william
l.
messenger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
enforcing
section
302
in
this
case
cannot
conflict
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
unite
admits,
organizing
agreements
such
as
this
are
meant
to
privatize
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
avoid
the
representational
procedures.
the
agreement
here
expressly
requires
that
the
employer
not
petition
for
a
secret
ballot
election,
not
file
unfair
labor
practices
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
also
provide
assistance
to
the
employer
--
or
to
the
union,
that
he
has
no
right
to
receive--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
i
would
say
two
things.
first,
the
issue
of
course
are
the
three
individual
provisions,
not
organizing
agreements
as
a
whole.
the
three
things
at
issue
here
of
course
is
the
gag
clause,
the
use
of
property,
and
the
information,
not
the
agreement.
but
secondly,
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
comes
from
its
holding
that
this
intangible
assistance
can't
be
delivered,
it
can
only
be
paid,
and
therefore,
the
court
held
you
needed
to
show
consideration
for
payment.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
it's
at
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion,
right
above
the
section
that
you
just
read
from,
where
the
court
held
that
it
didn't
believe
that
things
could
be
delivered,
which
we
disagree
with,
but
they
can
be
paid;
and
therefore,
if
consideration
is
given,
then
you
have
a
violation.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
consideration
would
show
that
the
purposes
of
the
statute
are
implicated
by
the
transaction,
because
in
that
case
the
union
is
being
influenced
by
what
the
employer
gave.
so
the
eleventh
circuit,
when
it
said
that
not
all
ground
rules
agreements
will
violate
302
was
saying
that
if
no
consideration
was
given,
there
would
be
no
payment
and
therefore
no
violation
in
that.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
if
there
is
consideration.
so
if
the
employer
gives
this
assistance
and
the
union
gives
something
in
return
--
for
example,
here
the
$100,000
political
campaign
and
agreement
not
to
strike
--
then
it
becomes
a
payment,
because
the
consideration
shows
payment.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
don't
believe
that
it
renders
the
case
moot,
for
two
reasons,
the
first
of
which
is
that
unite
has
pending
a
lawsuit
to
compel
arbitration
in
which
it
is
alleging
violations
of
the
agreement
that
occurred
before
it
expired.
and
one
of
the
remedies
the
union
is
seeking
is
to
have
the
agreement
extended
for
a
longer
period
of
time,
which
is
a
remedy
it
received
before.
and
that
lawsuit
is
currently
pending
in
federal
district
court.
it's
been
stayed
pending
these
proceedings.
and
then
the
second
reason
is
unite
continues
to
demand
this
organizing
assistance.
302(b)(1)
makes
it
illegal
for
a
union
to
demand
a
thing
of
value,
even
if
it
doesn't
receive
it.
unite
here
is
clearly
still
demanding
that
mardi
gras
help
it
organize
its
employees,
so
mulhall
still
has
standing
to
seek
injunctive
relief
to
stop
the
union
from
demanding
those
things.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
the
first
two
could
because
the
exceptions
to
302
start
to
apply,
the
exceptions
found
at
302(c).
for
example,
access
for
union
stewards
has
been
upheld
under
section
(c)(1),
which
allows
for
access
to
union
officials
if
by
reason
of
their
service
to
the
employer.
and
so
giving
a
union
steward
use
of
property
to
administer
the
contract
and
such
has
been
upheld.
that
case
is
basf
v
--
basf
wyandotte.
the
information.
during
collective
bargaining,
a
union
has
a
right
to
information
under
section
aep
5
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
giving
that
information
would
fall
under
the
exception
found
at
(c)(2),
which
provides
for
the
release
of
any
claim
that
a
union
may
have.
and
so
the
union
has
a
legal
claim
to
that
information
under
the
nlra,
so
if
the
employer
agreed
to
provide
it
or
did
provide
it,
it
would
fall
under
that
exception.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
your
honor.
and
because
in
the
collective
bargaining,
a
union
of
course
is
supposed
to
act
as
an
employee
representative
and
not
for
itself,
so
most
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
go
to
the
employees,
not
to
the
union
itself.
302's
whole
purpose
or
primary
purpose
is
precisely
to
prevent
such
self-dealing.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
well,
the
structure--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
i
believe
that
is
the
structure
of
section
302.
(a)
and
(b)
are
simply
a
bright-line
gift
ban,
and
then
(c)
provides
the
exceptions
to
it.
and
that
sort
of
structure
for
a
conflict
of
interest
statute
is
relatively
common.
and
so
the
common
terms
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
either,
a,
deliver
nothing
to
the
union
itself
but
give
things
to
employees
such
as
wages,
or
in
the
alternative,
does
go
to
the
union,
it
has
to
fall
under
one
of
the
exceptions,
and
there's
numerous--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--because--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--well,
for
two
reasons,
but
the
first
and
most
important
is
that
section
302
is
part
of
the
labor
law.
it
was
enacted,
of
course,
as
part
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
amended
as
part
of
the
labor
management
reporting
disclosure
act.
so
you're
not
talking
about
two
different
statutory
schemes,
as
in
billing,
where
you
had
the
sec
law
and
you
had
the
antitrust
law.
302
is
federal
labor
law.
it
is
every
bit
as
much
a
federal
labor
law
as
any
provision
of
the
national
labor
relation
act.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
the
concept
would
if
there
was
a
direct
conflict
between
the
general
prohibition
of
302
and
any
right
granted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
importantly
here,
nothing
gives
unite
any
right
to
the
three
things
it
demands
from
mardi
gras.
so
enforcing
302
in
this
case
cannot
conflict
with
the
nlra.
unite
has
no
right
to
information
from
mardi
gras
about
its
nonunion
employees,
no
right
to
use
its
property,
as
this
court
held
in
lechmere,
and
certainly
no
right
to
control
its
communications,
as
8(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
that
even
the
nlrb
can't
control
an
employee's
--
an
employer's
communications
absent
a
threat
or
promise
of
benefit.
so
there
is
no
conflict
here.
and
a
persuasive
opinion,
although
obviously
not
binding,
is
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
in
mercy
memorial
hospital
where
the
sixth
circuit
--
in
that
case
the
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb
said
the
employer's
conduct
does
not
violate
the
nlra
and
the
union
brought
a
302
claim
anyway
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
it
could
bring
that
claim.
302
is
meant
to
be
independent
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
they
didn't
give
the
nlrb
any
jurisdiction
over
it
and
doesn't
preempt.
and
they
also
added
if
it
did
preempt
302,
302
would
be
a
dead
letter.
i
mean,
anything
section
302
deals
with
will
be
covered
by
the
nlra--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--that
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
gives
them
a
right
to
that.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
exactly.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
but
section--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--but
section
302
was
specifically
amended
in
1959
to
apply
to
union
organizing.
they
added
section
8(a)(2)
to
extend
the
prohibition
to
unions
that
seek
to
represent.
section
8(a)(3)
applies
to
things
given
to
employee
committees
to
influence
employees
in
their
right
to
organize
or
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
an
organizing
exception
--
an
organizing
exception
to
section
302
would
tear
a
massive
hole
in
the
statute.
it's
difficult
to
think
of
anything
that
unions
value
more
than
an
employer's
assistance
with
unionizing
more
employees
into
the
union.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
because
the
issue,
i
believe,
with
any
agreement
is
each
particular
term
has
to
be
looked
at
individually.
so,
for
example,
if
the
issue
was
a
particular
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
illegal,
the
question
would
be
phrased,
are
collectively
bargaining
agreements
legal.
same
thing
with
organizing
agreements.
every
term
is
different.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
because
that,
again,
went
back
to
its
payment
holding,
and
mulhall's
position
is
that
the
court
should
overrule
the
lower
court's
decision
that
organizing
assistance
cannot
be
delivered.
a
list
of
information
can,
of
course,
be
delivered,
so--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--that's
correct.
consideration,
obviously,
can
show
value,
and
it
could
show
towards
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
but
30--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
exactly.
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
exactly.
because
302
is
structured
not
as
a
bribery
statute
that
requires
a
quid
pro
quo.
it's
a
gift
ban
to
ensure--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes,
with
caveats.
the
--
with
the
first
two,
it
could
fall
into
exceptions
in
other
circumstances.
for,
again,
during
a
collective
bargaining
relationship,
some
of
the
exceptions
start
to
apply
to
the
information
and
use
of
property.
and
going
towards
the
communications,
if
an
employer
unilaterally
said,
i'm
not
going
to
say
anything.
i
don't
have
the
time
or
money
to
fight
the
union,
it
can
do
so.
but
if
an
employer
contractually
agrees
and
gives
the
union
control
over
its
speech,
then
yes,
a
thing
of
value--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
and
if
this
is
going
back--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--it's
not
rare
now.
it's
only
become
prevalent
in
the
1990s
to
go--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--the
exact
opposite
is
true.
section
301
gives
courts
jurisdiction
to
enforce
any
agreement
between
a
labor
organization
and
an
employer.
302
makes
it
illegal
for
an
employer
to
agree
to
deliver
something
to
a
union.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
many
times.
however,
302
was
not
raised
in
those
cases.
so
would
they
have
enforced
the
agreement
if
it
was
alleged
that
it
was
--
violated
302?
that,
of
course,
is
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
and
this--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes.
and
this
would
actually
create
a
larger
hole--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--because
of
anything
enforceable--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
to
a
degree,
yes,
but
302
always
covers--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--the
difference,
your
honor
--
i
can't
speak
for
bologna,
but
302
is
meant
to
govern
labor
relations--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--including
organizing,
including
collective
bargaining.
so
anything
that
the
nlrb
--
what
do
you
call
it?
has
coverage
over,
302
also
covers
it.
so,
for
example--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no,
because
in
that
case,
there's
no
thing
that's
actually
be
given
to
the
union,
especially
if
you're
talking
about
negotiating
a
collectively
bargaining
agreement,
which,
of
course,
those
benefits
go
to
employees.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
but
the
question
becomes
negotiate
what?
so
if
the
question
is
let's
negotiate
over
employee
wages,
wages
go
to
employees,
there's
nothing
there.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
say
we
will
negotiate
over
how
much
money
we'll
pay
you
to
stop
striking,
well,
then
that's
illegal
under
302.
so
it
just
begs
the
question
or
raises
the
question
--
i'm
sorry
--
of
what
comes
next
after
that
agreement
to
negotiate.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
would
say
in
that
case,
even
if
it
did
have
value,
no
thing
is
delivered
to
the
union.
because
302--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no,
your
honor.
it
would
be
illegal
to
agree
or
to
do
that.
so
if
an
employer
didn't
agree
to
allow
the
union
on
its
property,
it
just
did,
that
would
still
be
the
delivery
of
the
use
of
property.
so
that's
not
my
position.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
not
if
he
does
so
unilaterally.
but
if
he
agrees
to
do
so,
then
the
control
is
given
to
the
union
very
similar
to
a
noncompete.
and
the
agreement
--
the
agreement.
the
example
i
used
in
the
brief
i
believe
is
a
good
one.
if
coca-cola
decides
not
to
run
advertising
against
pepsi,
it
hasn't
given
anything
to
pepsi.
it
doesn't
enter
into
a
noncompete
agreement.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
and
there
will
be
consideration.
so
the
hypothetical
given
of
the
employer
just
doing
it
in
exchange
for
nothing
will
almost
never
happen,
as
i
believe
unite
says
in
its
brief--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--yes.
so
if
the
--
for
example,
if
the
employer
just
said
to
the
union,
here's
a
thousand
dollars,
just
put
it
on
the
table,
that's
a
violation.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
any
further
than
that.
or
if
the
union
said,
give
me
a
thousand
dollars,
that's
illegal.
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
hand
it
over.
but
it's
very
unusual
to
have
this
kind
of
organizing
agreement
without
a
quid
pro
quo.
most
employers
don't
hand
over
their
employees
to
the
union
without
something
in
exchange,
either
pre-negotiated
concessions
at
employee
expense,
such
as
an
adcock,
or
an
agreement
not
to
strike
or
a
political
campaign
such
as
here.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
the
interest
arbitration?
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
wouldn't
call
that
consideration.
i
believe
the
consideration
was,
what
the
union
gave
the
employer
was,
the
hundred-thousand-dollar
political
campaign
and
the
agreement
not
to
strike.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
not
to
strike.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
during
collective
bargaining,
no,
because
it
would
fall
under
the
final
clause
of
section
(c)(2).
mr.
william
l.
messenger
then
if
that
had
value
to
the
union,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
no,
because
the
grievance
procedures
ultimately
go
to
the
employee.
so
a
grievance
over,
for
example,
should
this
employee
get
back
pay
doesn't
deliver
anything
to
the
union.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
well,
but
302,
its
very
structure
sort
of
differentiates
the
union
from
the
employee,
so
the
thought
of
what's
good
for
the
union
is
good
for
the
employee
is
somewhat
rejected
implicitly
in
302,
that
there's
a
separation
there.
the
union
is
supposed
to
act
as
their
representative--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--i
believe
i
didn't
perhaps
explain
it
correctly.
it's
not
that
if
the
union
can
say
this
is
good
for
employees,
that's
exculpatory.
the
question
is
who
gets
the
thing.
in
other
words,
302
is
a
very
literal
interpretation,
not
mine,
but
just
going
back
to
the
text,
302
requires
the--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--payment
or
delivery
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
payment
or
delivery.
so
if
the
thing
is
delivered
to
the
employee
and
not
to
the
union
itself,
it's
not
covered.
so,
for
example,
the
original
legislative
history,
they
said
what
about
the
wages
to
the
employees
and
the
supporting
senator
said--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--grievance
procedures--
mr.
william
l.
messenger
--no.
because
what
--
i
don't
believe
that
has
any
value
intrinsically
to
the
union.
a
grievance
procedure
is
simply
a
contractual
mechanism
to
do
something
else.
so
the
question
is
what's
--
in
other
words,
take
arbitration.
if
you
agree
to
arbitrate
something,
what
are
they
arbitrating?
if
you're
arbitrating
over
what
the
union
gets,
then,
yes,
that
could
be
illegal.
but
if
you're
arbitrating
over
what
goes
to
employees,
the
thing
is
delivered
to
the
employees.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
but
is
the
value
coming
from
the
employer?
like,
there
the
argument
would
be
the
value
is
being
given
is
the
goodwill
of
employees
towards
the
union.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
i
would
say
probably
not,
because
what
is
ultimately
the
thing?
is
it
--
if
they
gave
it
control
perhaps
over,
like,
you
can
now
run
the
auto
shop
and
take
the
profits
from
it,
then
yes.
however,
if
it's
merely,
we'll
listen
to
your
input,
exactly
is
being
given?
because
i
think
it's
important
--
mulhall
is
not
arguing
for
an
expansive
interpretation
of
302.
the
three
things
that
are
actually
at
issue
here
are
rather
direct
things
given
directly
to
the
union:
lists
of
information,
use
of
property.
so
if
you
do
move
more
to
the
fringes
of
things
that
may
create
indirect
benefits
to
unions,
that
may
create
some
problems
and
some
difficulties.
but
the
court
need
not
reach
those
here
to
find
organizing
assistance
to
violate
the
statute.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
it
would
be
control.
that's
what
pled,
is
you
can
deliver
control
over
your
communications
to
another.
and
that's
done
in
gag
clauses
which
are
common
in
litigation,
of
course;
and
also
in
noncompete
agreements,
which
are
intangible
assets
for
tax
purposes.
so
those
can
--
that
control
can
be
delivered
to
another
party
or
paid
if
it
is
done
in
consideration
for
something
else.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
not
exactly.
the
employer
has
to
give
a
list
to
the
nlrb,
and
then
the
nlrb
distributes
it
to
all
parties.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
eventually,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes,
and
the
reason
is
it's
not
the
possession
of
the
list
that's
somehow
wrongful.
it's
the
fact
that
it's
given
by
the
employer,
which
creates
the
danger:
what
will
the
union
give
in
exchange.
that's
the
danger
that
302
exists
to
take
care
of,
not
that
it's
necessarily
wrongful
per
se
for
a
union
to
have
lists
of
information
or
the
use
of
property,
but
what
will
it
do
in
return.
and
unions
have
compromised
employee
interests
in
exchange
for
this
type
of
assistance.
they
certainly
have
extorted
employers.
and
here
unite
is
willing
to
conduct
a
hundred-thousand-dollar
political
campaign
for
this
information.
so,
of
course,
in
that
hypothetical
they'd
get
it
the
next
day
anyway,
so
it
would
be
rather
unusual
for
it
to
happen.
but
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
union
can't
request
an
election,
that
list
is
extremely
valuable
to
them.
and
as
unite's
conduct
shows,
they
value
it
enough
to
do
something
in
exchange
for
it.
mr.
william
l.
messenger
yes.
i
mean,
that's
probably
--
that
may
be
true.
however,
302
doesn't
prohibit,
as
mr.
--
opposing
counsel
said,
prohibit
a
union
from
giving
something
to
an
employer.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
