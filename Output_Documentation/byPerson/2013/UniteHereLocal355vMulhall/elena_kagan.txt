in
the
typical
case,
how
important
is
an
agreement
like
this
to
the
union?
how
much
does
it
increase
the
likelihood
that
the
union
will
be
selected
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative?
justice
elena
kagan
why
is
that?
justice
elena
kagan
did
you
also
raise
in
an
earlier
stage
an
argument
that
he
had
no
private
right
of
action?
justice
elena
kagan
that
has
never
been
litigated?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger,
do
i
understand
the
structure
of
your
argument
to
be
as
follows:
that
whether
before
certification
or
afterwards
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
along
the
lines
that
justice
scalia
said,
the
only
thing
that
an
employer
can
promise
a
union
or
agree
to
provide
to
a
union
are
things
that
are
specifically
authorized
in
other
parts
of
the
labor
law?
is
that
the
structure
of
your
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
you
see,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
premise
and
the
policies
of
the
labor
laws
are
to
encourage
a
wide
variety
of
employer/employee
agreements,
both
things
that
are
listed
in
the
labor
laws,
that
are
provided
for
in
the
labor
laws,
but
many
things
that
are
not;
that
the
idea
is
to
get
these
parties
together
to
reach
agreements
on
a
wide
variety
of
things
that
matter
to
them
regardless
whether
the
labor
law
specifically
refers
to
that.
justice
elena
kagan
it
seems
sort
of
turning
the
whole
thing
on
its
head
to
say
that
the
only
things
that
are
allowed
in
terms
of
promises,
whether
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
prior
to
that,
are
the
things
that
the
law
itself
requires.
justice
elena
kagan
so,
mr.
messenger,
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
that,
you're
saying
that
regardless
of
whether
there
was
a
bargain
in
this
case,
forget
the
bargain.
let's
just
say
that
there
was
an
employer.
this
employer
said,
you
know,
i
think
that
my
employees
should
have
a
right
to
listen
to
you
and
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
want
to
be
represented
by
--
by
the
union,
so
i'm
inviting
the
union
onto
my
premises.
just
simple
as
that.
you're
saying
that
the
employer
cannot
do
that.
justice
elena
kagan
but
we
--
we
don't
need
this.
i
mean,
you
say--
justice
elena
kagan
--of
course,
this
is
important
to
the
union,
so
your
argument
is
that
it
falls
within
the
statute,
regardless
of
whether
there's
any
consideration
or
quid
pro
quo.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
so
this
is
to
say
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
prohibits
employers
from
providing
access
to
their
premises,
from
granting
a
union
a
list
of
employees,
or
from
declaring
itself
neutral
as
to
a
union
election.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger,
suppose
that
there
was
a
--
a
union
and
it
was
striking.
and
the
union
goes
to
the
employer
and
--
and
they
reach
agreement,
and
the
agreement
is
the
union
will
stop
striking
if
the
employer
agrees
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
with
the
union.
so
that's
the
promise
that
the
employer
makes
to
the
union.
i'm
going
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
with
you.
and
that's,
obviously,
a
thing
of
important
value
to
the
union.
is
that
also
prohibited?
justice
elena
kagan
there's
no
thing
that's
given
to
the
union?
i
mean,
i
would
think
if
your
argument
is
thing
of
value
is
anything
that's
of
value,
there's
nothing
that's
of
greater
value
to
the
union
than
an
employer's
agreement
to
negotiate.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
--
i
mean,
we're
going
to
negotiate
about
all
kinds
of
things,
things
--
things
that
unions
and
employers
negotiate
about,
and
that's
of
great
benefit
to
the
union.
the
union
gets
to
turn
around
to
all
its
employees
and
say:
look
at
this,
the
employer
is
going
to
sit
down
and
talk
with
us.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger,
would
your
argument
apply
to
the
following?
i'm
just
going
to
give
you
a
few
different
kinds
of
promises.
a
promise
to
give
the
union
information
about
the
company
and
its
finances?
justice
elena
kagan
but
not
if
not
during
collective
bargaining?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sure
it
does.
an
agreement
giving
the
union
a
role
in
grievance
procedures?
justice
elena
kagan
could
you
explain
that
distinction
to
me,
ultimately
go
to
the
employee?
i
mean,
i
assume
that
everything
that
the
union
does,
the
union
is
saying,
well,
ultimately
the
benefits
go
to
the
employee.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
union,
on
the
ones
that
you
say,
well,
the
neutrality
agreements,
the
access,
that's
just
to
the
union,
the
union
can
turn
around
and
say:
no,
ultimately
it's
to
the
employee,
that
we're
going
to
represent
the
employees
well.
so
the
line
you're
drawing
seems
quite
inadministrable
to
me.
justice
elena
kagan
okay,
so
the--
justice
elena
kagan
--no,
please.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
my
hypothetical
is
the
thing,
was
the
union's
role
in
grievance
procedures.
justice
elena
kagan
so
the
union
gets
it,
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
i'll
tell
you
that
a
union
that
can
say
that
it
has
a
role
in
grievance
procedures
is,
that's
an
important
thing
for
a
union
to
be
able
to
tell
its
employees.
that's
of
real
value
to
the
union
to
have
that.
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
--
how
about
if
a
company
gives
a
union
a
role
in
company
decision-making,
any
kind,
hiring,
any
other
kind
of
company
decision-making?
the
company
says,
we
want
the
union
to
participate
in
this.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
messenger,
the
excelsior
rule,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
the
nlrb
says
that
an
employer
absolutely
has
to
give
a
list
of
employees--
justice
elena
kagan
--to
the
union
seven
days
after
an
election
is
called;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
okay,
okay.
but
the
union
gets
it
seven
days
after?
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's
by
requirement.
so
you're
suggesting
that
if
the
employer
gives
it
six
days
after,
that's
not
only
not
required,
that's
forbidden?
justice
elena
kagan
so
it
goes
within
a
period
of
24
hours,
something
that
no
employer
can
do
voluntarily
to
something
that
has
to
be
done.
