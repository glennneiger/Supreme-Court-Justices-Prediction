we
will
hear
argument
first
in
case
12-99.
unite
here
local
355
v.
mulhall.
mr.
mccracken?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
list
--
the
list
of
--
the
list
of
employees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sometimes
there's
a
conflict
between
two
different
groups
that
want
to
unionize
the
same
workforce,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
this
work
in
that
case?
let's
say
the
employer
gave
--
entered
in
an
agreement
like
this
with
one
union
that
wanted
to
organize
the
same
workforce
but
not
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
that
suggest
it's
a
thing
of
value
in
--
in
this
context?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
the
agreements
--
are
the
agreements
uniform
or
do
they
have
varying
elements?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
--
is
the
card
check
provision
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
i
may?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
you
recall
the
point
you
made
earlier,
the
point
is,
yes,
voluntary
agreement,
but
if
a
majority
of
the
workforce
wants
to
be
organized
and
represented
by
that
union,
and
the
argument
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
this
agreement
taints
that
process,
in
particular,
by
allowing
the
card
check
procedure
that
it
has
been
argued
exercises
coercion
against
employees
to
support
the
union.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
argument
that
the
card
check--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
will
you
--
will
you
concede
that
they're
more
coercive
than
a
secret
ballot?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
union
organizer
comes
up
to
you
and
says,
well,
here's
a
card.
you
can
check
i
want
to
join
the
union,
or
two,
i
don't
want
a
union.
which
will
it
be?
and
there's
a
bunch
of
your
fellow
workers
gathered
around
as
you
fill
out
the
card.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
messenger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mccracken,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
there
was
a
promise
to
exercise
the
first
amendment
rights
in
a
particular
way
up
to
the
amount
of
$100,000.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
--
that's
a
little
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
