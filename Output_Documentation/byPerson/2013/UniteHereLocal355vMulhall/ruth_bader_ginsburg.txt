mr.
mccracken,
could
you
--
could
you
tell
--
tell
us
about
this
particular
contract,
because
as
far
as
i
can
fathom
from
what
we
have
it
expired
at
least
a
year
ago
and
there
was
--
there
was
no
recognition,
there
was
no
election;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so,
are
we
dealing
with
a
live
case
considering
that
the
--
the
agreement
has
expired?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
the
relief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
--
is
it
on
the
theory
that
it
did
it
once,
so
it
might
do
it
again?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
not
in
this
--
not
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
raised
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
sinclair
is
of
a
certain
age
before
this
court
looked
more
carefully
at
the
implication
of
private
rights
of
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
united
states
have
a
position
on
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
under
302?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
curious
thing
about
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
is
it
didn't
reject.
it's
a
--
it's
a
curious
opinion
and
we
are
at
an
interlocutory
stage.
but
the
opinion
reads:
"employers
and
unions
may
set
ground
rules
for
an
organizing
campaign
even
if
the
employer
and
union
benefit
from
the
agreement.
"
so
that
the
eleventh
circuit
seemed
to
agree
that
these
agreements
are
enforceable.
but
it
said
that
it
can
--
they
can
become
illegal
if
used
in
a
scheme
to
corrupt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
messenger,
you
are
dealing
with
a
decision
that
seems
to
uphold
organizing
agreements.
i
just
read
the
passage
and
all
that
it's
saying
is:
find
out
if
in
this
case
there
was
some
corruption
involved.
but
it
does
say
employers
and
unions
may
set
ground
rules
even
if
the
employer
and
the
union
benefit
from
the
agreement.
so
you
seem
to
be
construing
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
to
say
something
it
didn't
say,
to
say
that
organizing
agreements
violate
302.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
--
it
says
that,
at
the
end
of
that
passage,
curbing
bribery
and
extortion
are
implicated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
said
that's
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
is
your
position
on
the
effect
of
the
expiration
of
this
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
messenger,
to
clarify,
because
i
thought
you
told
me
before
that
some
organizing
agreements
are
okay.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
all
organizing
agreements
--
in
other
words,
are
you
taking
a
position
in
opposition
to
what
i
read
from
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
organizing
agreements
can
be
valid?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
--
you
do
you
want
us
to
say
that
--
that
to
the
extent
that
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
"employers
and
unions
may
set
ground
rules
for
an
organizing
campaign,
even
if
the
employer
and
union
benefit
from
the
agreement.
"
you
want
us
to
say
that
that
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
has
--
it
has
been
enforced
under
301.
so
it
--
it
would
be
odd
to
say
that
an
agreement
that
is
enforceable
that
court
--
courts
haven't
enforced
agreements
just
like
this
under
301
are
criminal
under
302.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
--
have
courts
enforced
agreements
just
like
this
one
under
301?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
--
we
heard
from
the
other
side
that
that
hundred-thousand-dollar
payment
for
the
ballot
initiative
was
a
benefit
both
because
it
would
mean
that
there
would
be
many
more
workers
employed
by
the
casino
if
they
were
allowed
to
go
into
this
new
line
of
business.
so
that
it
wasn't
payment
to
the
employer
of
something
that
is
of
benefit
exclusively
to
the
employer.
it
was
to
the
union's
benefit
too.
