justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
support
of
the
legislation
to
permit
slot
machines?
was
that
a
promise
that
the
union
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
assume
that
there
was
such
a
commitment
by
the
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
would
have
been
a
quid
pro
quo
for
that,
certainly.
i
mean,
the
union
wouldn't
promise
that
for
nothing.
it
would
get
something
in
exchange
such
as,
as
in
this
case,
the
right
to
go
on
the
employer's
property
to
--
to
recruit
union
members
or
--
or
some
other
thing
of
value
from
the
employer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccracken,
the
respondent's
brief
here
asserts
that
these
kinds
of
precertification
agreements
have
only
been
common
since
the
--
the
'90s.
is
that
accurate
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he's
a
big
guy.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
slot
machines?
you
--
you
mentioned
all
of
the
other
things
promised,
but
not
--
not
the
promise
to
support
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
messenger,
could
--
could
all
of
these
things
that
the
employer
gave
to
the
union
be
included
in
a
finally-negotiated
collective
bargaining
agreement?
couldn't
that
cba
say
that
the
union
shall
have
the
ability
to
approach
employees
on
the
site,
that
the
union
shall
have
access
to
the
employee
list
of
the
employer
--
and
what
else,
what's
the
third
--
and
that
the
employer
will
not
--
will
not
seek
to
undermine
the
union?
could
all
of
that
be
included
in
a
cba?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that
would
also
--
it
would
also
follow
if
--
if
--
with
no
indication
in
the
text,
you
simply
exclude
organizing
--
the
organizing
part
of
labor
law.
i
guess
it
would
mean
that
the
--
the
union
can
cut
a
deal
with
the
employer
that
if
the
employer
gives
them
a
freehand
and
--
and
assists
them
in
--
in
organizing,
the
union
will
promise
not
to
--
not
to
seek
a
raise
in
wages
or
not
to
seek
insurance
coverage
or
whatever.
i
guess
that
would
also
be
part
of
the
organizing
campaign,
right,
so
it
would
be
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
benefits
--
benefits
to
the
employees
always
benefit
the
union.
i
mean,
that's
--
you
know,
that's
automatic,
it
seems
to
me.
i
don't
understand
how
you
say
that
this
is
just
a
gift
statute
and
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any,
anything
on
the
other
side,
no
quid
pro
quo.
you
say
it's
perfectly
okay
if
the
--
if
the
employer
allows
the
union
to
come
on
his
premises
to
recruit
members,
but
it's
not
okay
for
him
to
agree,
to
agree
to
do
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if
the
employer
does
not
oppose
the
union,
he
neither
speaks
against
it
nor
for
it?
is
that
giving
something
of
value
to
the
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
no
meaning
to
say
you
agree
to
something
when
you're
not
getting
anything
in
return.
you
can
promise
something
without
getting
anything
in
return.
but
to
agree?
i
think
that
means,
you
know,
i
won't
do
it
in
exchange
for
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it
did
happen,
you'd
say
it
would
be
a
violation.
