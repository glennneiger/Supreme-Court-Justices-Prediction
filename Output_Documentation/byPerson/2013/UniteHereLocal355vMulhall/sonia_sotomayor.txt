so
why
isn't
that
the
property
that
justice
kennedy
referred
to?
they
--
the
union
paid
$100,000
to
get
the
items
that
the
employer
gave
them.
so
aren't
they
valued,
something
tangible,
valued
for
what
the
union
paid
for
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why?
well,
the
--
the
argument
that
justice
scalia
and
kennedy
are
referring
to
it,
is
that
the
employer
paid
with
the
employee
list,
the
access
to
the
facility,
the
promises
not
to
strike
to
get
the
100,000.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
--
because
the
union
paying
money
is
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
it's
clear
that
there's
some
difficulty
in
defining
the
limits
of
property.
there
are
some
things
that
i
think
have
value
even
though
they
may
not
have
market
value.
for
example,
an
employer
bribing
a
union
steward
by
offering
him
a
favorable
work
schedule
or
--
or
days
off
that
are
a
weekend
or
something
that's
valuable
to
the
worker
but
doesn't
necessarily
have
an
objective
value.
the
government
cites
credit
suisse
v.
billing
in
its
brief.
when
you
get
up
on
rebuttal,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
--
the
law
that
has
developed
in
that
case
and
why
it
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
billing
your
best
argument,
the
framework
of
billing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
some
people
have
suggested
that
billings
is
limited
to
the
antitrust
area.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
how
do
you
respond
to
that
belief
and
--
and
how
do
you
convince
us
to
expand
the
doctrine
outside
its
traditional
context?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
why
don't
--
why
doesn't
the
billings
--
billing
framework
apply
beautifully
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
it
holds
is
that
where
there's
a
regulatory
framework,
and
here
there
is,
that
produces
standards
of
conduct,
going
to
justice
kagan's
point,
that
almost
all
of
the
three
things
that
you're
arguing
against
are
standards
of
conduct
that
have
been
approved
by
--
have
been
approved
by
the
government,
and
when
those
conflict
with
the
separate
federal
statute,
then
they
are
implicitly
preempted,
essentially.
why
doesn't
that
doctrine
do
the
work
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
we
have
conflicting
provisions
within
standard
statutes
anyway,
so
why
doesn't
the
concept
behind
it
still
apply?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
argue
that
the
three
items
in
dispute
--
the
access
to
property,
etc.
--that
the
consideration
is
the
agreement
to
go
into
arbitration,
first
of
all,
putting
aside
the
hundred
thousand
dollars.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
arbitration
of
disputes
that
was
promised
by
the
employer
and
the
union
under
this
agreement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
to
strike.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
mccracken--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
i
understood
the
circuit
below,
it
was
suggesting,
like
the
government,
that
an
exchange
of
agreements
for
purposes
of
peaceful
recognition,
terms
that
were
given
for
that
purpose
were
legal,
but
that
things
given
for
--
that
were
not
solely
for
recognition,
had
value
outside
of
that,
like
money,
would
be
wrong.
that
100,000
is
troubling
to
me
because
i
think
what
the
circuit
was
saying
is
if
the
100,000
bought
the
peaceful
recognition
provisions,
then
that's
corrupt,
and
that
is
outside
the
exemptions
that
the
law
provides.
that's
how
i
read
its
decision.
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong
about
that
and
tell
me
how
i
deal
with
that
niggling
problem
i
have
about
the
$100,000,
because
it
does
feel
like
a
bribe
to
the
employer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
think
it
--
it
was
puzzled
by
the
provisions
at
issue.
i
think
it
was
puzzled
by
the
100,000.
