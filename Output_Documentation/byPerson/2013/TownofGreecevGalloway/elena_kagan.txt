justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hungar,
i'm
wondering
what
you
would
think
of
the
following:
suppose
that
as
we
began
this
session
of
the
court,
the
chief
justice
had
called
a
minister
up
to
the
front
of
the
courtroom,
facing
the
lawyers,
maybe
the
parties,
maybe
the
spectators.
and
the
minister
had
asked
everyone
to
stand
and
to
bow
their
heads
in
prayer
and
the
minister
said
the
following:
he
said,
we
acknowledge
the
saving
sacrifice
of
jesus
christ
on
the
cross.
we
draw
strength
from
his
resurrection.
blessed
are
you
who
has
raised
up
the
lord
jesus.
you
who
will
raise
us
in
our
turn
and
put
us
by
his
side.
the
members
of
the
court
who
had
stood
responded
amen,
made
the
sign
of
the
cross,
and
the
chief
justice
then
called
your
case.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
elena
kagan
the
extension
just
between
the
legislature
and
any
other
official
proceeding;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
i
ask
the
exact
same
question,
same
kinds
of
statements,
same
sort
of
context,
except
it's
not
in
a
courtroom.
instead,
it's
in
a
congressional
hearing
room.
maybe
it's
a
confirmation
hearing,
maybe
it's
an
investigatory
hearing
of
some
kind,
and
that
a
person
is
sitting
at
a
table
in
front
of
the
members
of
a
committee,
ready
to
testify,
ready
to
give
his
testimony
in
support
of
his
nomination.
the
minister
says
the
exact
same
thing.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why--
justice
elena
kagan
--suppose
you
are
correct,
mr.
hungar,
for
11
years
the
prayers
sounded
almost
exclusively
like
the
ones
that
i
read,
and
one
year
on
four
occasions,
there
was
some
attempts
to
vary
it
up,
to
have
a
baha'i
minister
or
a
--
a
wiccan,
but
for
the
most
part,
not
out
of
any
malice
or
anything
like
that,
but
because
this
is
what
the
people
in
this
community
knew
and
were
familiar
with
and
what
most
of
the
ministers
were,
most
of
the
prayers
sounded
like
this.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
gershengorn,
do
you
think
that
if
the
legislature
--
excuse
me
--
if
the
town
board
here
just,
you
know,
started
it
off
with
a
prayer
and
then
kept
on
going,
do
you
think
that
that
would
be
a
significantly
different
case
and
you
would
switch
sides?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
gershengorn,
could
you
respond
to
this?
here's
what
our
--
our
country
promises,
our
constitution
promises.
it's
that,
however
we
worship,
we're
all
equal
and
full
citizens.
and
i
think
we
can
all
agree
on
that.
and
that
means
that
when
we
approach
the
government,
when
we
petition
the
government,
we
do
so
not
as
a
christian,
not
as
a
jew,
not
as
a
muslim,
not
as
a
nonbeliever,
only
as
an
american.
and
what
troubles
me
about
this
case
is
that
here
a
citizen
is
going
to
a
local
community
board,
supposed
to
be
the
closest,
the
most
responsive
institution
of
government
that
exists,
and
is
immediately
being
asked,
being
forced
to
identify
whether
she
believes
in
the
things
that
most
of
the
people
in
the
room
believe
in,
whether
she
belongs
to
the
same
religious
idiom
as
most
of
the
people
in
the
room
do.
and
it
strikes
me
that
that
might
be
inconsistent
with
this
understanding
that
when
we
relate
to
our
government,
we
all
do
so
as
americans,
and
not
as
jews
and
not
as
christians
and
not
as
nonbelievers.

justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
laycock,
would
you--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
laycock,
sort
of,
all
hypotheticals
aside,
isn't
the
question
mostly
here
in
most
communities
whether
the
kind
of
language
that
i
began
with,
which
refers
repeatedly
to
jesus
christ,
which
is
language
that
is
accepted
and
admired
and
incredibly
important
to
the
majority
members
of
a
community,
but
is
not
accepted
by
a
minority,
whether
that
language
will
be
allowed
in
a
public
town
session
like
this
one.
that's
really
the
question,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
that's
the
issue
that
actually
arises.
here's
what
--
i
don't
think
that
this
is
an
easy
question.
i
think
it's
hard,
because
of
this.
i
think
it's
hard
because
the
court
lays
down
these
rules
and
everybody
thinks
that
the
court
is
being
hostile
to
religion
and
people
get
unhappy
and
angry
and
agitated
in
various
kinds
of
ways.
this
goes
back
to
what
justice
breyer
suggested.
part
of
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
maintain
a
multi-religious
society
in
a
peaceful
and
harmonious
way.
and
every
time
the
court
gets
involved
in
things
like
this,
it
seems
to
make
the
problem
worse
rather
than
better.
what
do
you
think?
