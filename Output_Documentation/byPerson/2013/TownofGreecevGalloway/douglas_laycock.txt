mr.
douglas
laycock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
answer
to
justice
kagan's
opening
question
is
entirely
formalistic.
there
is
no
separation
in
time
between
the
public
hearing
and
the
invocation.
people
appear
before
this
town
board
to
ask
for
personal
and
specific
things.
our
clients
put
shows
on
the
cable
channel.
they
were
concerned
the
cable
channel
was
about
to
be
abolished
or
made
much
less
usable.
people
appear
to
ask
for
a
group
home,
parents
of
a
down
syndrome
child.
there
are
many
personal
petitions
presented
at
this
--
in
the
immediate
wake
of
the
prayer.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
in
the
public
forum.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it's
not
the
same
thing
as
the
hearing
and
that's
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
--
the
hearing
is
a
particular
kind
of
proposal.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
is
--
that
is
somewhat
separated
in
time.
the
forum
is
not.
and
people
make
quite
personal
proposals
there.
they
ask
for
board
action.
they
often
get
board
action.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it
is
--
it
is
direct
democracy.
when
a
citizen
appears
and
says,
solve
the
traffic
problem
at
my
corner,
solve
this
nuisance
family
that
commits
a
lot
of
crimes
in
my
block,
that's
not
asking
for
legislation
or
policymaking.
that's
asking
for
administrative
action.
this
board
has
legislative,
administrative,
and
executive
functions.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
--
that's
not
what
we're
saying.
we're
saying--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we're
saying
you
cannot
have
sectarian
prayer.
the
town
should
instruct
--
should
have
a
policy
in
the
first
place,
which
it
doesn't,
instruct
the
chaplains
keep
your
prayer
nonsectarian,
do
not
address
points
of--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we
--
we
take
marsh
to
--
to
imply
that
atheists
cannot
get
full
relief
in
this
context,
and
the
mccreary
dissenters
said
that
explicitly.
so
points
on
which
believers
are
known
to
disagree
is
a
--
is
a
set
that's
in
the
american
context,
the
american
civil
religion,
the
judeo-christian
tradition--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--about
a
third
of
the
prayers
in
this
record,
your
honor,
are
acceptable.
mr.
douglas
laycock
can
i
have
the
joint
appendix?
the
prayers
to
the
almighty,
prayers
to
the
creator.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
some
religions
that
believe
in
more
than
one
god
believe
that
all
their
many
gods
are
manifestations
of
the
one
god.
but
the
true
polytheists
i
think
are
also
excluded
from
the
mccreary
dissent.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
if
devil
worshippers
believe
the
devil
is
the
almighty,
they
might
be
okay.
but
they're
probably
out--
[laughter]
mr.
douglas
laycock
i'm
just
flipping
through.
there
are
a
number
of
examples,
but
if
you
look
at
page
74a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
prayer
from
august
13,
2003
--
no
i'm
sorry.
that
ends
“
in
christ's
name
”.
but
there
are
--
the
count
was
about,
about
two-thirds,
one-third.
so
there
are
plenty
of
them
in
here.
mr.
douglas
laycock
“
heavenly
father
”
is
very
broadly
acceptable.
and
you
know,
the
test
cannot
be
unanimity,
because
that's
impossible,
right?
that's
why
the
atheists
are
--
that's
why
the
atheists
are
excluded.
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia;
would
you
repeat
your
question?
mr.
douglas
laycock
no.
principally
the
clergy
make
this
determination.
there
is
a
200-year
tradition
of
this
kind
of
civic
prayer.
the
clergy
know
how
to
do
it.
if
the
city
has
a
policy,
then
an
occasional
violation
by
one
clergy
is
not
the
city's
responsibility.
so
--
so
this
is
left
principally
to
the
clergy
by
simply
giving
them
instructions.
they
receive
no
instruction
of
any
kind
about
the
purpose
of
this
prayer
or--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
right.
37
state
legislative
bodies,
the
house
of
representatives
have
these
kinds
of
guidelines.
they
issue
them
to
the
guest
clergy
before
they
appear.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
you
might
have
a
conversation
with
him
first
and--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--editing
the
content
of
government-sponsored
prayers.
of
course
these
clergy
can
pray
any
way
they
want
on
their
own
time
with
their
own
audience.
but
this
is
an
official
government
event.
and
it's
part
of
the
board's
meeting.
it's
sponsored
by
the
government.
and
they
delegate
the
task
to
these
clergy
and
they
can
define
the
scope
of
that--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
coerces
the
people
who
are
about
to
stand
up
and
ask
for
things
from
the
board
and--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
and
that's
why--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
as
well.
coercion
is
one
test
for
the
establishment
clause,
but
there
is
also
broad
agreement
on
the
court,
and
there
has
been,
that
sectarian
endorsements
are
prohibited
by
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
douglas
laycock
there
are
many
coercive
aspects
here
of
varying
degrees
of
importance.
citizens
are
asked
to
participate,
to
join
in
the
prayer.
they're
often
asked
to--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--they
are
often
asked
to
physically
participate,
to
stand
or
to
bow
their
heads.
the
testimony
is
most
of
the
citizens
bow
--
most
of
the
citizens
bow
their
heads
whether
they
are
asked
to
or
not.
so
people
who
are
not
participating
are
immediately
visible.
the
pastors
typically
say:
“
please
join
me
in
prayer
”.
they
offer
the
prayer
on
behalf
of
everyone
there.
they
talk
about
“
our
christian
faith
”.
mr.
douglas
laycock
what's
coercive
about
it
is
it
is
impossible
not
to
participate
without
attracting
attention
to
yourself,
and
moments
later
you
stand
up
to
ask
for
a
group
home
for
your
down
syndrome
child
or
for
continued
use
of
the
public
access
channel
or
whatever
your
petition
is,
having
just,
so
far
as
you
can
tell,
irritated
the
people
that
you
were
trying
to
persuade.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
if
the
separation
in
time
really
works,
that's
part
of
the
remedy
that
we've
suggested
that
is
possible
here.
we
still
believe
that
prayers
should
be
nonsectarian.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
we
think
the
town
has
to
have
a
policy.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
we've
tried
to
sort
out
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
make
it
clearer.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i'm
talking
about
what
would
be--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we
think--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we
think
the
town
needs
a
policy.
the
policy
should
give
guidelines
to
chaplains
that
say:
stay
away
from
points
in
which
believers
are
known
to
disagree.
and
we
think
the
town
should
do
what
it
can
to
ameliorate
coercion.
it
should
tell
the
clergy:
don't
ask
people
to
physically
participate.
that's
the
most
important
thing.
the
government
suggests
disclaimers
might
help.
we
think
that's
right.
the
government
suggests
separating
the
prayer
a
bit
more
in
time.
some
states
put
their
prayer
before
the
call
to
order.
the
prayer
could
even
be
five
minutes
before
the
beginning
of
the
meeting.
the
coercion
can't
be
entirely
eliminated,
but
the
gratuitous
coercion,
the
things
that
are
done
that
don't
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
have
a
prayer
could
be
eliminated.
and
we
think
those
two
pieces
are
the
components
of
a
remedy.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we
haven't
said
they
can't
invoke
the
deity
or
have
a
prayer,
and
they
can
certainly
pray
any
way
they
want
silently
or
just
before
the
meeting.
we've
said
they
cannot
impose
sectarian
prayer
on
the
citizenry,
and
that
is
very
different
from
what
congress
does,
it
is
very
different
from
what
this
court
does.
maybe
the
closest
analogy
is
legislative
committee
hearings
where
the
citizens
interact.
we
don't
have
a
tradition
of
prayer
there.
what
--
what
--
what
the
town
board
is
doing
here
is
very
different
from
anything
in
the
tradition
that
they
appeal
to.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we
think
that
rotation
does
not
work.
first
of
all,
because
--
for
several
reasons,
but
most
citizens
come
for
a
single
issue
to
one
or
two
meetings.
they
get
the
prayer
they
get
that
night.
they
don't
benefit
from
the
rotation
scheme.
any
rotation
scheme
will
be
dominated
by
the
local
majority,
maybe
even
disproportionate
to
its
numbers.
religious
minorities
--
unfamiliar
minorities
give
the
prayer.
there
are
often
political
protests;
there
are
often
threats
and
hate
mail.
they
don't
want
to
give
the
prayer.
and
many
city
councils
won't
stand
up
to
the
political
pressure
and
enable
those
people
to
give
the
prayer.
so
there
are
multiple
reasons
why
rotation
does
not
solve
the
problem
here.
we
think
nonsectarianism
has
a
very
long
tradition.
the
government
is
not
a
competent
judge
of
religious
truth,
madison
said,
that
was
not
a
controversial
proposition
in
the
founding.
and
even
in
the
first
congress,
in
the
prayers
they
point
to,
there
were
no
prayers
there
that
violate
our
principle,
invoking
details
in
which
believers
disagree.
because
then,
98-1/2
percent
of
the
population
was
protestant,
christ
was
not
yet
a
point
that
disbelievers
disagreed.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we
--
we
cannot
treat
--
i'm
not
a
pastor
--
we
cannot
treat
everybody,
literally
everybody
equally
without
eliminating
prayer
altogether.
we
can
treat
the
great
majority
of
the
people
equally
with
the
tradition
of
prayer
to
the
almighty,
the
governor
of
the
universe,
the
creator
of
the
world--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i
think
you
picked
them,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we've
excluded
the
atheists.
i
don't
think
the
baha'i
are
excluded,
but
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
atheists
are
inevitably
excluded.
we
can't
help--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--true
poly
--
true
polytheists
who
don't
understand
their
gods
as
manifestations
of
the
one
god
are
probably
excluded.
i'm
not
sure
many
others
are.
and
you
have
all
these
lawyerly
hypotheticals,
but
the
fact
is
we've
done
this
kind
of
prayer
in
this
country
for
200
years.
there's
a
long
tradition
of
civic
prayer
and
the
clergy
know
how
to
do
it.
when
in
greece,
no
one
has
told
them
that's
what
we
want
you
to
do.
and
--
and
i
would
say
the
one
time
the
country
in
a
major
way
got
involved
in
government-sponsored,
sectarian
prayers
that
people
disagreed
about
was
when
we
imposed
protestant
religious
exercises
on
catholic
children
in
the
19th
century.
and
that
produced
mob
violence,
church
burnings,
and
people
dead
in
the
streets.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
lee
v.
weisman
twice
reserves
the
question
of
whether
adults
might
be
subject
to
similar
pressures.
mr.
douglas
laycock
in
some
ways
that
adults
are
not.
but
there's
--
there's
no
doubt
that
before
you
stand
up
to
ask
for
relief
from
a
governing
body,
you
don't
want
to
offend
that
body.
adults
are
subject
to
coercion
here.
and
--
and
no
competent
attorney
would
tell
his
client,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
visibly
dissent
from
the
prayer
or
not.
you
try
to
have
your
client
make
a
good
impression.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
wouldn't
use
all
those
adjectives,
but
yes.
and
we
don't
think
that's
difficult
to
do.
mr.
douglas
laycock
we'd
like
to
be
a
little
more
explicit,
but
those
are
vastly
better
than--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--you
know,
there
are
such
people
and
i
respect
that
and
they
should
not
be
giving
government
prayers.
they're
taking
on
a
government
function
when
they
agree
to
give
the
invocation
for
the
town
board.
mr.
douglas
laycock
they're
--
they're
not
praying
for
their
congregation.
they
are
--
they
are
invited
by
the
board,
the
prayer-giver
is
selected
by
the
board,
the
board
decides
to
have
the
prayer,
the
board
gives
this
one
person
and
only
one
person
time
on
the
agenda
to
pray.
this
is
clearly
governmental
as
you
held
in
santa
fe--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--precisely.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
the
test
that
we
have
proffered
is
the
test
from
the
mccreary
dissent,
points
on
which
believers
are
known
to
disagree.
so
you
don't
have
to
be
a
theologian.
points
on
which
people
are
commonly
known
to
disagree,
and
the
fourth
circuit
has
had
no
difficulty
administering
this
rule.
the
cases
that
come
to
it
are
clearly
sectarian
or
clearly
nonsectarian.
mr.
douglas
laycock
but
it's
not
censorship
when
it's
the
governmental--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--if
you
really
believe
government
can't
draw
lines
here,
then
your
alternatives
are
either
prohibit
the
prayer
entirely
or
permit
absolutely
anything,
including
the
prayer
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
where
they
ask
for
a
show
of
hands,
how
many
of
you
believe
in
prayer?
how
many
of
you
feel
personally
in
need
of
prayer?
if
there
are
no
limits,
you
can't
draw
lines.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it
was
how--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
was
how
he
introduced
his
prayer,
and
if
you
can't
draw
lines
i
don't
know
why
he
can't
say
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
the
issue
that
actually
arises
in
the
case.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
true.
there
are
people
who
distort
your
decisions.
there
are
people
who
misunderstand
your
decisions
honestly
and
--
and
innocently.
but
keeping
government
neutral
as
between
religions
has
not
been
a
controversial
proposition
in
this
court.
and
i
don't
think
the
fourth
circuit
has
made
it
worse.
they've
got
a
workable
rule
and
the
prayers
are
no
longer
exclusively
christian
prayers
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
they
have
been
able
to
mostly
enforce
that
and
there
hasn't
been
litigation
at
the
margins
because
all
the
prayers
were
clearly--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that
would
help
immensely.
we
think
some
of
the
clergy
need
more
detailed
explanation
of
what
that
means,
but
yes,
that
would
help
immensely.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
government
became
very
heavily
involved
in
religion
when
we
decided
there
could
be
prayers
to
open
legislative
sessions.
marsh
is
the
source
of
government
involvement
in
religion.
and
now
the
question
is
how
to
manage
the
problems
that
arise
from
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
fair
enough.
the
tradition
to
which
marsh
points.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
--
that's
correct,
and
that
had
prayers
that
did
not
address
predestination
or
having
to
accept
jesus
as
your
savior
or
any
point
on
which
listeners
disagree.
mr.
douglas
laycock
they
were
very
explicitly
christian,
but
that
was
not
a
point
of
disagreement
at
the
time.
they
stayed
away
from
any
issue
that
protestants
disagreed
on.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it's
not
that
the
people
in
greece
can't
do
it.
it's
just
that
this
board
is
functioning
in
a
fundamentally
different
way
from
what
congress
or
the
state
legislature
functions.
and
also--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
it
wouldn't
have
been
their
choice.
but
did
he
talk
about
the
choice
between
bishops
and
presbyters
and
congregations
as
a
way
of
governing
the
church?
they
have
not
offered
a
single
example
of
a
prayer
in
the
founding
era
that
addressed
points
on
which
protestants
were
known
to
disagree.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
one.
the
founding
generation
kept
government
out
of
religious
disagreements.
and
what
has
changed
is
not
