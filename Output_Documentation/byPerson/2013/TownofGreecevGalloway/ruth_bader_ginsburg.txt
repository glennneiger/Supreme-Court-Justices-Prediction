well,
the
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
question,
mr.
hungar--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
your
position
is
that
wouldn't
matter,
as
i
understand,
because
you
have
--
you
have
--
you
have
two
limitations,
proselytizing
and
disparaging.
and
--
but
i
think
justice
kagan's
question
just
set
place
--
place
limitations.
one
could
read
your
brief
and
say,
well,
it
doesn't
matter;
it
could
be
an
executive
body,
it
could
be
a
court,
it
could
be
a
town
meeting,
a
school
board,
a
zoning
board,
a
utilities
board.
that's
--
is
this
case
about
prayer
at
the
beginning
of
a
legislative
session
or
is
it
about
prayer
in
all
three
branches
of
government?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
--
is
there
any
constitutional
historical
practice
with
respect
to
this
hybrid
body?
it's
not
simply
a
legislature.
it
has
a
number
of
administrative
functions.
sometimes
it
convenes
as
a
town
meeting.
sometimes
it
entertains
zoning
applications.
is
there
a
history
for
that
kind
of
hybrid
body,
as
there
is
for
the
kind
of
legislature
we
had
in
nebraska
or
our
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gershengorn,
your
--
your
brief
is
the
one
who
brought
up
--
and
you
were
quite
candid
about
it
--
the
hybrid
nature
of
that
body.
i
think
it's
on
pages
22
to
24
of
your
brief.
and
you
say
it
would
be
proper
to
have
certain
checks
in
that
setting.
so
for
one,
make
sure
that
the
entrance
and
the
exit
is
easy.
for
another,
inform
the
people
in
town
of
the
tradition
so
they
won't
be
confused.
but
you
recognize
on
the
one
hand
that
this
isn't
like
congress
or
the
nebraska
legislature,
and
then
you
say
these
would
be
nice
things
to
do.
are
you
saying
just
that
it
would
be
good
and
proper
or
are
you
saying
it
would
be
necessary
given
the
hybrid
nature
of
this
body?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
remedy,
this
case
was
remanded
by
the
second
circuit
for
the
parties
together
with
the
court
to
work
out
appropriate
relief.
and
if
you
could
tell
us
what
you
think
that
relief
would
be,
because
then
that
is
a
measure
of
the
constitutional
infraction.
so
what
would
--
you
put
yourself
before
the
district
judge
and
propose
the
changes
that
you
think
would
be
necessary
to
bring
this
practice
within
the
constitutional
boundary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
my
question
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
theory,
and
you
say
existing
situation
violates
the
constitution.
so
what
changes
do
you
think
would
need
to
be
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
would
bring
this
within
the
constitutional
boundary?
