chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-696,
the
town
of
greece
v.
galloway.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
make
a
difference
in
your
analysis
if
instead
of,
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
there
was
a
point
of
saying,
all
rise
or
something
of
that
sort?
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
hypothetical
justice
kagan
posed
were
the
same
except
people
weren't
told
to
rise
or
invited
to
rise
or,
in
fact,
were
told
to
stay
seated,
something
like
that,
so
there
would
be
no
indication
of
who
was
participating
in
the
prayer?
is
that
a
--
is
that
a
ground
of
distinction
that
you're
willing
to
accept
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
wonder
how
far
you
can
carry
the
--
your
historical
argument
and
whether
some
of
these
things
are
properly
regarded
as
more
historical
artifacts,
right?
i
mean,
our
motto
is
"
in
god
we
trust
”,
right?
that's
the
motto.
it's
been
that
for
a
long
time,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
wouldn't
we
look
at
it
differently
if
there
were
--
suddenly
if
there
were
a
proposal
today
for
the
first
time,
to
say
let's
adopt
a
motto
“
in
god
we
trust
”?
would
we
view
that
the
same
way
simply
because
it's
--
in
other
words,
the
history
doesn't
make
it
clear
that
a
particular
practice
is
okay
going
on
in
the
future.
it
means,
well,
this
is
what
they've
done
--
they
have
done,
so
we're
not
going
to
go
back
and
revisit
it.
just
like
we're
not
going
to
go
back
and
take
the
cross
out
of
every
city
seal
that's
been
there
since,
you
know,
1800.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
would
be
okay
to
adopt
a
seal
today
that
would
have
a
cross
in
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gershengorn.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
laycock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
atheists.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
is
going
to
make
this
determination?
is
it
--
is
it
an
ex
ante
determination?
you
have
to
review
the
proposed
prayer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'll
repeat
mine.
it
was:
who
was
supposed
to
make
these
determinations?
is
there
supposed
to
be
an
officer
of
the
town
council
that
will
review?
do
prayers
have
to
be
reviewed
for
his
approval
in
advance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
is
an
official
in
the
town
council
that
is
to
instruct
clergy
about
what
kind
of
prayer
they
can
say?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
exactly
--
since
you
are
adopting
the
coercion
test,
what
exactly
is
coercive
in
this
environment?
having
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
prayer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
are
asked
to
participate,
and
--
but
not
in
any
tangible
way.
they
say:
well,
i'm
not
going
to
participate,
and
everybody's
just
sitting
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
to
be
clear,
are
you
talking
about
what
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
second
circuit
or
satisfactory
to
you?
because
you
don't
accept
the
second
circuit's
approach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we've
already
excluded
the
atheists,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we've
already
separated
out,
i
thought,
in
our
jurisprudence,
children
and
adults.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
do
accept
the
fact
that
children
may
be
subject
to
subtle
coercion
in
a
way
that
adults
are
not,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
laycock.
mr.
hungar,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
