justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
about
the
individual
plaintiffs
here.
and
what
do
we
know
about
them?
they
obviously
have
appeared
at
proceedings
and
they
object
to
the
proceedings.
does
the
record
show
that
they
had
matters
before
the
town
council
during
the
hearings
part
of
the
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
public
forum
part?
they
did
speak
occasionally
then;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
we
know
what
they
spoke
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
did
they
--
what
was
the
issue
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
during
the
public
--
that's
during
the
public
forum
part.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
is
not
really
--
it's
not
the
same
thing
as
the
hearing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there's
another
--
there's
another
part
of
the
proceeding
that
is
the
hearing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that's
when
somebody
has
a
specific
proposal.
they
want
to
--
something
specifically
before
the
board
and
they
want
relief.
they
want
a
variance.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
is
separated
in
time.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that
is
a
legislative
body
at
that
point.
it's
clearly
a
legislative
body,
is
it
not?
the
only
--
the
difference
is
it's
a
town
rather
than
--
than
congress
or
a
state
legislature
where
you
have
more
formalized
procedures.
this
is
--
this
is
more
direct
democracy.
or
it's
like
a
--
it's
a
town
meeting.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
that
is
your
argument,
then
you
are
really
saying
you
can
never
have
prayer
at
a
town
meeting.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
could
you
do
it?
because
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
always
comes
up
at
town
meetings.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
give
me
an
example.
give
me
an
example
of
a
prayer
that
would
be
acceptable
to
christians,
jews,
muslims,
buddhists,
hindus.
give
me
an
example
of
a
prayer.
wiccans,
baha'i.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
give
me
an
example
then.
i
think
the
point
about
atheists
is
a
good
point.
but
exclude
them
for
present
purposes
and
give
me
an
example
of
a
prayer
that
is
acceptable
to
all
of
the
groups
that
i
mentioned.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
give
me
an
example.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
to
“
the
almighty
”.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
--
if
a
particular
religion
believes
in
more
than
one
god,
that's
acceptable
to
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
74a,
“
heavenly
father
”,
that's
acceptable
to
all
religions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
a
practice
that's
a
little
bit
different.
maybe
you'll
say
it's
a
lot
different
from
what
the
town
of
greece
does.
first
of
all,
this
town
starts
out
by
making
--
by
proceeding
in
a
more
systematic
and
comprehensive
way
in
recruiting
chaplains
for
the
month
or
whatever
it
is.
so
instead
of
just
looking
to
all
the
houses
of
worship
within
the
town,
it
identifies
places
of
worship
that
may
be
outside
the
town
boundaries
that
people
within
the
town
who
adhere
to
a
minority
religion
may
attend.
and
it
makes
it
clear
that
it's
open
to
chaplains
of
any
religious
--
of
any
religion
on
a
rotating
basis.
and
then
they
have
--
they
structure
their
proceedings
so
that
you
have
the
prayer,
and
then
the
legislative
part
of
the
town
meeting.
and
then
there's
a
clear
separation
in
time
and
access
between
that
part
of
the
proceeding
and
the
hearing
where
variances
and
things
of
that
nature
are
held.
now,
you
would
still
say
that's
unconstitutional
because
you
have
to
add
on
that
a
prayer
that
is
acceptable
to
everybody;
is
that
it?
is
there
any
other
problem
with
what
i've
just
outlined?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
gets
exactly
to
the
--
that
gets
exactly
to
the
problem
with
your
argument
about
nonsectarian
prayer.
yes,
when
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
country,
the
population
was
98
percent-plus
protestant.
then
it
became
predominantly
christian.
then
it
became
predominant
--
almost
exclusively
christian
and
jewish.
and
it
--
but
now,
it's
not
that
--
it's
--
it's
gone
much
further
than
that.
so
we
have
a
very
religiously
diverse
country.
there
are
a
lot
of
muslims,
there
are
a
lot
of
hindus,
there
are
buddhists,
there
are
baha'is,
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
adherents
to
all
sorts
of
other
religions.
and
they
all
should
be
treated
equally,
and
--
but
i
don't
--
i
just
don't
see
how
it
is
possible
to
compose
anything
that
you
could
call
a
prayer
that
is
acceptable
to
all
of
these
groups.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
haven't
given
me
an
example.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
marsh
is
not
the
source
of
government
involvement
religion
in
this
respect.
the
first
congress
is
the
source.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
first
congress
that
also
adopted
the
first
amendment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
many
of
them
were
very
explicitly
christian,
were
they
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
the
first
chaplain
of
the
senate
was
the
episcopal
bishop
of
new
york;
isn't
that
correct?
and
he
used
to
read
--
he
took
his
prayers
from
the
book
of
common
prayer.
that
was
acceptable
to
baptists
at
the
time,
quakers?
