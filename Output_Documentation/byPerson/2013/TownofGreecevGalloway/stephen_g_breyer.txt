justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
objection
to
--
to
doing
one
thing
that
was
suggested
in
the
circuit
court
opinion,
which
is
to
publicize
rather
thoroughly
in
--
in
the
area
that
those
who
were
not
christians,
and
perhaps
not
even
religious,
are
also
welcome
to
appear
and
to
have
either
a
prayer
or
the
equivalent
if
they're
not
religious?
do
you
have
an
objection
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
--
then
there
--
is
there
a
disagreement
on
that
point,
because
certainly,
that
was
one
of
the
concerns.
it
wasn't
on
anyone's
website.
there
are
--
greece
is
a
small
town
very
near
rochester,
and
there
are,
at
least
in
rochester,
lots
of
people
of
different
religions,
including
quite
a
few
of
no
religion.
so
--
so
could
you
work
that
out,
do
you
think,
if
that
were
the
only
objecting
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
constitutional
problem
i
got
from
the
opinion
of
doing
the
opposite,
of
--
of
not
making
an
effort
to
make
people
who
are
not
christian
feel,
although
they
live
near
in
or
near
the
town
or
are
affected
thereby,
participants
over
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
it's
not.
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
any
objection.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
--
would
you
have
--
if
all
that
were
left
in
the
case
were
the
question
of
you're
making
a
good
faith
effort
to
try
to
include
others,
would
you
object
to
doing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
different
from
putting
it
on
a
website.
that's
different
from
making
an
organized
effort
to
see
that
people
get
the
word.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
perhaps
he's
asking
me
that
question
and
i
can
answer
it
later.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
--
i
would
like
you
to
take
into
account
an
aspect
of
this.
i
mean,
in
my
own
opinion,
i
don't
know
of
anyone
else's,
i'm
not
talking
for
others.
but
one
--
a
major
purpose
of
the
religion
clauses
is
to
allow
people
in
this
country
of
different
religion,
including
those
of
no
religion,
to
live
harmoniously
together.
now,
given
that
basic
purpose,
what
do
we
do
about
the
problem
of
prayer
in
these
kinds
of
legislative
sessions?
one
possibility
is
say,
you
just
can't
do
it,
it's
secular.
but
that
is
not
our
tradition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the
second
possibility
is
the
one
that
you
are
advocating.
and
it
has
much
to
recommend
it,
try
to
keep
non-denominational,
try
to
keep
it
as
inoffensive
to
the
others
as
possible.
that's
the
upside.
the
downside
is
seeing
supervised
by
a
judge
dozens
of
groups,
and
today,
there
are
60
or
70
groups
of
different
religions
coming
in
and
saying,
no,
that
doesn't
work
for
us,
this
doesn't
work
for
us,
and
that's
the
nightmare
that
they
are
afraid
of.
i
mean,
even
in
this
town
or
in
the
area,
there
are
significant
numbers,
as
well
as
christians,
of
jews,
of
muslims,
of
baha'is,
of
hindus,
and
others.
so
there's
a
third
approach,
and
that
is
say,
well,
you
can't
have
them
if
there's
any
aspect
of
coercion.
but
we
just
saw
people
walking
into
this
room,
“
god
save
the
united
states
”
and
you
want
to
win
your
case.
i
didn't
see
people
sitting
down.
then
the
fourth
approach,
which
is
the
other
that
has
--
makes
its
appearance
here,
is
to
say
let's
try
to
be
inclusive.
now,
was
enough
--
in
other
words,
so
you
didn't
get
the
right
prayer
today,
but
you
--
and
even
with
the
nonreligious,
you
know
many
believe
in
the
better
angels
of
our
nature
and
the
spiritual
side
of
humankind;
it's
not
impossible
to
appeal
to
them.
so
you
say,
you'll
have
your
chance.
and
that's
the
thing
i
--
i
would
like
you
to
explore.
i
mean,
is
there
a
way
of
doing
that
or
is
that
preferable
to
the
other
ways
or
do
we
get
into
trouble?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
congress
has
a
set
of
guidelines
which
you've
read
and
are
here
in
the
papers
and
so
forth.
are
those
satisfactory
to
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
those
are
satisfactory
to
you,
then
i
wonder,
are
they
satisfactory
to
everyone.
and
--
and
you
will
find
all
kinds
of
different
beliefs
and
thoughts
in
this
country,
and
there
will
be
people
who
say,
but
i
cannot
give
such
a
prayer
if
i
am
a
priest
in
that
particular
--
or
a
minister
or
whatever
in
that
particular
religion.
i
must
refer
to
the
god
--
to
god
as
i
know
that
god
by
name.
and
what
do
we
do
with
them?
that's
what
--
i
mean,
we
can
recommend
it,
but
can
we
say
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
did
this.
you
combined
your
two
approaches.
the
town
has
to
--
it
cannot
--
it
must
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
appeal
to
other
religions
who
are
in
that
area.
and
then
you
have
these
words
from
the
house:
"the
chaplain
should
keep
in
mind
that
the
house
of
representatives,
or
you
would
say
whatever
relative
group.
"
is
comprised
of
members
of
many
different
faith
traditions,
"period,
end
of
matter.
"
"is
that
sufficient,
those
two
things?
"
