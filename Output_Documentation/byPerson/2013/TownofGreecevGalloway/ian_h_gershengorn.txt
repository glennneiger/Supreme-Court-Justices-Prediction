mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
circuit's
decision
here
requires
courts
to
determine
when
a
legislature
has
permitted
too
many
sectarian
references
in
its
prayers
or
has
invited
too
many
christian
prayer-givers.
that
approach
is
flawed
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
cannot
be
squared
with
our
nation's
long
history
of
opening
legislative
sessions
not
only
with
a
prayer,
but
a
prayer
given
in
the
prayer-giver's
own
religion
idiom.
and
second,
it
invites
exactly
the
sort
of
parsing
of
prayer
that
marsh
sought
to
avoid
and
that
federal
courts
are
ill-equipped
to
handle.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
so
we
agree
with--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
--
at
the
prayer
to
determine
proselytizing.
but
it's
a
very
different
series
of
judgments,
we
submit,
than
determining
whether
something
is
sectarian.
the
kinds
of
debates
we're
having,
i
think,
are
reflected
in
the
differences--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--we
agree
that
these
are
sectarian.
but
the
kinds
of
debates
that
you're
seeing
among
the
parties,
whether,
for
example,
15
percent,
50
percent,
60
percent
of
the
congressional
prayers
are
sectarian.
those
are
debates
about
whether
“
holy
spirit
”
is
sectarian.
a
court
--
a
district
court
has
held
that
“
allah
”
is
not
sectarian.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
your
honor,
whether
i
would
sit
or
not,
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
many
would
sit,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
but
we
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
address
the
coercion
point
this
way:
with
respect
to
town
councils,
it's
our
view
that
as
a
general
matter
that
the
municipal
legislatures
can
invoke
the
same
tradition
of
solemnizing
and
invoking
divine
guidance
as
federal
and
state
legislatures.
we
recognize
there
are
differences,
however,
and
your
honor
has
pointed
to
one
and
that's
the
--
what
was
called
the
public
forum
here.
and
we
think
it's
very
--
because
those
are
the
ones
where
the
--
is
adjudicated
license
applications,
liquor
applications.
and
we
do
think
it
is
important
on
this
record
that
those
are
separated
in
time.
it's
at
the
court
of
appeals
appendix
929
and
1120.
so
that
the
meeting
starts
at
6:00,
which
is
in
the
prayer
--
when
the
prayer
is,
but
the
board
meetings
to
adjudicate
those
types
of
issues
are
at
6:30
or
6:32.
and
so
the
type
of
concern
that
your
honor
has
raised
is
not
presented
on
this
record
and
we
think
that's
significant.
we
think
some
of
the
other
factors--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--i
don't
know
that
we
would
switch
sides,
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
it
mitigates
the
coercion
that
the
--
that
the
respondents
have
identified.
and
we
think
it
--
that
that
is
one
of
the
significant
differences
between
the
town,
the
--
the
town
legislature
and
a
--
and
the
legislature--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--we
don't
agree
that
coercion
is
the
test,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
we
think
it's
the
history
--
we
think
the
history
is
the
--
the
principal
guidance
of
marsh
is
--
we
think
there
are
three
pillars
in
marsh:
first
of
all,
that
the
history
is
what
the
court
looks
to
first.
and
here
there
was
a
long
history
of
legislative
prayer.
second,
that
the
court
should
be
very
wary
of
parsing
prayer
to
make
sectarian
judgments.
and
third,
what
marsh
said
is
that
adults
are
less
susceptible
to
religious
doctrine
--
indoctrination
and
peer
pressure.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
so,
justice
kagan,
i
think
we
agree
with
much
of
what
you
say.
but
--
but
with
the
difference
here
is
that
this
approaching
of
the
government
body
occurs
against
the
backdrop
of
240
years
of
history,
which
makes
this
different.
from
the
very
beginning
of
our
legislature,
from
the
first
continental
congress,
and
then
from
the
--
from
the
first
congress,
there
have
been
legislative
prayers
given
in
the
religious
idiom
of
either
the
official
chaplain
or
a
guest
chaplain,
that
have
regularly
invoked
the
--
the
deity
and
the
--
the
language
of
the
prayer-giver.
and
that--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--so,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
some
of
the
things
we
identify
which
are
similar
to
the
ones
that
justice
breyer
recommended,
i
think
our
view
is
they're
more
akin
to
safe
harbors,
that
there
are
undoubtedly
advancement
challenges
that
could
be
brought.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
town
can
point
to
things
such
as
--
such
as
public
criteria
and
things
like
that,
that
is
helpful.
with
respect
to
the
--
the
public
forum
aspect,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
position
as
to
whether
it
is
required,
but
we
do
think
that
that
makes
this
case
the
much
easier
case,
because
of
that
separation
of
the
one
part
that
is
the
strongest
argument
for
the
other
side,
that
there
is
an
element
of
coercion,
that
your
application
is
--
is
being
ruled
on,
that
the
separation
the
town
has
adopted
makes
that
much
less
persuasive.
we
think
the
other
elements
that
the
respondents
have
pointed
to
for
coercion
are
ones
that
trouble
us
because
they
are
things
that
have
analogs
in
our
history.
so,
for
example,
they
point
to
the
presence
of
children.
but,
of
course,
on
the
senate
floor
are
the
senate
pages,
who
are
all
high
school
juniors.
and
as
the
reply
brief
points
out,
there
are
often
children
in
the
galleries
at
state
legislatures
being
acknowledged.
and
so
some
of
those
--
those
elements
that
the
respondents
have
pointed
to
for
coercion
we
think
are
not
ones
that
the
court
should
--
should
adopt.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
so,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
much
narrower
test.
what
this
court
said
in
marsh
was
that
the
limit
on
legislative
prayers
is
prosle
--
does
it
proselytize,
advance,
or
denigrate
any
one
religion.
we
think
with
respect
to
the
content
of
the
prayer,
that
the
second
circuit
got
it
just
about
right,
that
the
question
is
does
it
preach
conversion,
does
it
threaten
damnation
to
nonbelievers,
does
it
belittle
a
particular--
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
--what
marsh
said
was
"proselytize,
advance,
or
denigrate.
"
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
that
--
that's
the
language
from
marsh,
your
honor,
is
to
proselytize
or
--
"proselytize,
advance,
or
denigrate.
"
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
so,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
what
marsh
meant
by
advance.
mr.
ian
h.
gershengorn
you're
not
quite
sure
why
“
advance
”
is
there,
or
why
the
rabbi
is
there.
we
don't
think
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
rabbi
--
that's
what
marsh
held,
that
marsh
--
what
marsh
says
is
“
advance
”
does
not
mean
having
a
single
--
a
single
chaplain
--
a
chaplain
of
a
single
denomination
or
looking
at
the
content
of
the
sectarian
prayer
in
light
of
that
history.
thank
you,
your
honor.
