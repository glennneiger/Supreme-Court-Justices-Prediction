justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
--
why
was
it
that
you
so
promptly
answered
justice
kagan's
question
to
the
effect
that
this
would
be
a
violation?
what/why
would
there
be
a
violation
in
the
instance
she
put?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
question
justice
kagan
asked
you,
the
hypothetical
about
the
prayer
in
this
court.
you
seemed
readily
to
agree
that
that
would
be
a
first
amendment
violation.
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
--
is
it
simply
history
that
makes
--
there's
no
rational
explanation?
it's
just
a
historical
aberration?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
--
what's
the
justification
for
the
distinction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
had
a
--
if
we
had
a
series
of
cases,
what
--
what
is
a
--
a
utility
rate-making
board
would
come
to
the
supreme
court.
we
say,
well,
it's
enough
like
a
legislative
that
it's
like
marsh.
but
i
don't
think
the
public
would
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
essence
of
the
argument
is
we've
always
done
it
this
way,
which
has
some
--
some
force
to
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
begins
and
ends
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
your
--
your
test
is
whether
or
not
--
part
of
your
test
--
is
whether
or
not
it
advances
religion.
if
you
ask
a
chaplain
for
the
state
assembly
in
sacramento,
california,
who's
going
to
go
to
the
assembly
to
deliver
a
prayer,
are
you
going
to
advance
your
religion
today,
would
he
say
oh,
no?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
you
--
you
use
the
word
“
advance
”
only
as
modified
by
“
proselytize
”?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
that's
--
that's
not
what
your
--
your
brief
says
“
does
not
proselytize
or
advance
”.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
that
the
test
you
want
us
to
adopt
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
asking
whether
or
not
it
is,
in
fact,
honest
and
candid
and
fair
to
ask
the
minister
or
--
or
the
priest
or
the
chaplain
or
the
rabbi
if
by
appearing
there,
he
or
she
seeks
to
advance
their
religion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
not,
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
they're
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
i'm
--
if
i'm
that
official
and
i
think
a
prayer
was
over
the
top
for
being
proselytizing
and
particularly
sectarian,
i
would
say
i
rather
not
--
you
not
come
back
next
week;
i
am
going
to
look
for
somebody
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
in
other
words
the
government
is
now
editing
the
content
of
prayers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
what
your
position
--
your
position
is
that
town
councils
like
greece
can
have
prayers
if
they
are
non-provocative,
modest,
decent,
quiet,
non-proselytizing.
that's
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
just
seems
to
me
that
enforcing
that
standard
and
the
standard
i
suggested
involves
the
state
very
heavily
in
the
censorship
and
--
and
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
prayers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
may
play
ultimately
in
your
position
if
we
say
that
that's
why
there
shouldn't
be
any
prayer
at
all.
but
then
you
have
the
problem
mentioned
by
justice
scalia
that
we
are
misrepresenting
who
we
really
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
should
we
write
that
in
a
concurring
opinion?
[laughter]
i
mean,
i'm
serious
about
this.
this
involves
government
very
heavily
in
religion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
way
it
sounds
quite
elitist
to
say,
well,
now,
we
can
do
this
in
washington
and
sacramento
and
austin,
texas,
but
you
people
up
there
in
greece
can't
do
that.
