mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
legislative
prayers
at
issue
in
this
case
were
not
offensive
in
the
way
identified
as
problematic
in
marsh,
but
the
court
then
committed
legal
error
by
engrafting
the
endorsement
test
onto
marsh
as
a
new
barrier
to
the
practice
of
legislative
prayer.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
and,
obviously,
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
of
legislative
prayer
in
the
marsh
doctrine,
which
recognizes
that
the
history
of
this
country
from
its
very
foundations
and
founding,
recognize
the
propriety
of
legislative
prayer
of
the
type
that
was
conducted
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
clearly,
marsh
involves
legislative
prayer,
the
tradition
that
we
rely
on
involves
legislative
prayer,
and
this
case
involves
legislative
prayer.
whether
--
what
rule
might
apply
in
other
contexts
would
depend
on
the
context.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
closer
question
because
of
the
congressional
history,
but,
of
course,
at
least
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
they
have
this
history
as
it
applies
to
the
legislative
body
as
a
whole,
not
to
committees,
but
it
would
be
a
different
question.
one,
obviously,
important
distinguishing
factor
there,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it's
not
the
legislative
body
as
a
whole--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--is
that
people
are
compelled
to
attend
and
testify
under
oath,
which
is
a
different
situation
from
the
one
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
why
we
believe
this
case
is
actually
an
easier
case
than
marsh
because
in
marsh,
there
was
a
paid
chaplain
from
the
same
denomination
for
16
years.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
no.
i
mean,
it's
clearly
not
correct
that
most
of
the
prayers
sounded
like
the
one
you
just
read.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
this
case
is
about
prayer
at
the
beginning
of
a
legislative
session.
that's
exactly
what
the
meetings
at
issue
here
are
--
are
about.
that's
what
the
board
of
the
town
of
greece
is.
in
fact,
respondents
try
to
argue
that
this
is
somehow
what
they
call
coercive
because
there
are
public
hearings
that
are
held.
but
the
public
hearings
are
held
at
least
30
minutes
after
the
prayer
and
anyone
coming
for
the
purpose
of
the
public
hearing
can
easily
show
up
after
the
prayer
if
they
don't
want
to
be
there.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
sorry.
which
instance,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
perhaps
i
conceded
too
much,
but
i
think
the
important
distinction
is
between
the
--
both
the
judicial
context
and
the
legislative
context
on
the
one
hand
and
the
--
the
absence
of
a
--
of
a
comparable
history
that
shows
that
it
did
not--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
question
of
historical
aberration.
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it's
a
question
of
what
the
establishment
clause
has
understood,
both
at
the
time
and
throughout
history,
to
forbid
and
not
to
forbid.
the
judiciary
is
different
than
a
legislature.
legislatures
can
be
partisan,
the
judiciary
should
not
be.
people
are
compelled
to
testify
under
oath.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
clearly--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
whether
--
if
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
if
the
hypothetical
is
as
you
described
with
a
different
minister,
with
--
with
an
open
process,
a
nondiscriminatory
process
like
the
one
we
have
here,
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
closer
case
than
this
one,
but
it
might
be
constitutional.
but
whether
that
case
is
constitutional
or
not,
this
case
is
far
from
the
constitutional
line,
further
from
the
constitutional
line
than
the
state
legislature's
practice
in
marsh.
because
there,
nebraska
had
one
chaplain
from
one
denomination
for
16
years
and
yet,
that
was
constitutionally
permissible,
and
his
prayers
were
not
distinguishable
in
content
from
the
prayers
at
issue
here
during
the
time
that
was
relevant
to
the
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
think
that
is
constitutionally
significant,
unless
--
i
mean,
it
might
be
different
if
people
are
compelled
to
stand,
but
whether
they
are
or
not
--
i
mean,
in
the
marsh
case
itself,
senator
chambers
testified
that
the
practice
in
the
nebraska
legislature
was
for
people
to
stand
and
he
felt
coerced
to
stand.
because
when
he
was
there
--
he
tried
to
avoid
it
--
but
when
he
was
there,
he
felt
he
needed
to
stand
because
everybody
else
was
doing
it
and
he
needed
to
have
dealings
with
these
people
as
a
fellow
legislator.
the
court,
nonetheless,
held
that
he's
an
adult
and
he
--
he
is
expected
to
be
able
to
disagree
with
things
that
he
disagrees
with
and
that
is
not
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
not
necessarily.
but
--
but
i
think
history
is
clearly
important
to
the
establishment
clause
analysis
under
this
court's
precedence
in
two
significant
respects,
both
of
which
apply
here,
one
of
which
might
not
apply
in
your
--
with
respect
to
your
hypothetical.
the
first
being
the
history
shows
us
that
the
practice
of
legislative
prayer,
just
like
the
motto,
has
not,
in
fact,
led
to
an
establishment
and,
therefore,
we
can
be
confident
it
is
not
in
danger
of
doing
so.
and
secondly,
the
history
of
legislative
prayer,
unlike
your
hypothetical,
goes
back
to
the
very
framing
of
the
first
amendment.
the
fact
that
--
then
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
marsh
--
the
fact
that
at
the
very
time
the
first
congress
was
writing
and
sending
the
--
the
first
amendment
out
to
the
states
to
be
ratified,
they
adopted
the
practice
of
having
a
congressional
chaplain.
and
the
congressional
chaplain
--
the
record
--
the
historical
record
is
clear
--
gave
prayers
that
were
almost
exclusively
sectarian,
as
respondents
define
that
word.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
think
this
court's
precedents
have
also
indicated,
at
least
in
some
cases,
that
if
--
if
a
practice
is
constitutional,
as
we
know
it
to
be
the
case
because
of
the
fact
that
it
has
been
understood
to
be
constitutional
and
consistent
with
our
religion
clauses
from
the
founding,
other
practices
that
have
no
greater
impact,
no
greater
tendency
to
establish
religion,
are
equally
constitutional.
and
we
believe
that
is
an
appropriate
doctrine.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor,
in
two
respects.
first
of
all,
the
becket
fund
amicus
brief
identifies
various
examples
of
--
of
municipal
government
prayer
over
the
course
of
our
founding,
which
is
--
over
the
course
of
our
history,
which
is
not
surprising
given
this
--
the
legislative
practice
at
the
state
and
federal
level
as
well.
and
secondly,
congress
for
much
of
its
--
of
much
of
our
history
entertained
private
bills,
which
would
be
the
equivalent
in
terms
of
legislative
or
non-purely
legislative
functions
you're
talking
about,
with
what
the
town
of
greece
does
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
your
honor,
whatever
--
whatever
line
might
be
drawn
between
non-legislative
bodies
and
legislative
bodies,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
legislative
meeting
of
a
legislative
body,
and
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
incongruous,
as
this
court
said
in
marsh,
if
congress
could
have
legislative
prayers
and
the
states
couldn't.
it
would
be
equally
incongruous--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
as
we
--
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
the
principles
that
undergird
the
establishment
clause
are
equally
consistent
with
the
position
we're
advancing
here.
as
the
--
as
your
opinion
in
the
county
of
allegheny
case
indicates,
the
fundamental
--
the
core
of
establishment
clause
concern
is
coercion
or
conduct
that
is
so
extreme
that
it
leads
to
the
establishment
of
a
religion
because
it
is
putting
the
government
squarely
behind
one
faith
to
the
exclusion
of
others,
and
that's
clearly
not
--
not
what's
going
on
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
there
is
--
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
there's
no
--
the
respondents
have
no
standing
to
assert
the
interests
of
children
or
police
officers
or
award
recipients
or
--
or
permit
applicants.
they
don't
even
claim
to
be
in
--
in
any
of
those
categories.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
on
at
least
one
occasion
one
of
them
spoke
about
the
prayer
--
or
on
one
or
two
occasions;
and
then
on
multiple
occasions
spoke
about
a
cable
access
channel
issue.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
something
about
--
she
was
expressing
vehement
disagreement
with
the
town's
decision
to
award
a
cable
access
channel
to
one
entity
as
opposed
to
another.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
certainly
not.
there'd
be--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
town's
position
would
be
on
that,
but
it
--
certainly,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem
with
doing
that.
i
mean,
here
as
a
practical
matter,
since--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but,
your
honor,
it's
a
perfectly
rational
approach
when
--
when
any
legislative
body
is
going
to
have
a
practice
of
legislative
prayer,
to
go
to
the
houses
of
worship
in
the
community.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
it
is
constitutionally
required,
although
i
would
note
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
has
happened
here
in
2007.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
know
what
the
town's
position
is
on
that.
as
i
said,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
has
already
happened
here.
the
town
deputy
supervisor
was
quoted
in
the
newspaper
saying
anyone
can
come
in
prayer,
anyone
can--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--as
i
say--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
would--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--in
the
rubin--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--it
would
be
some
invocation
of
guidance
and
wisdom
from--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i
don't
know.
in
--
in
the
rubin
case--
[laughter]
in
the
rubin
case,
a
nonreligious
person
delivered
invocations
on
multiple
occasions.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i
would
like
to
correct
one
factual
misimpression,
the
assertion
that
only
non-christian
prayer-givers
delivered
the
prayer
after
2008.
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
the
official
web
site
of
the
town
of
greece
shows
that
at
least
four
non-christian
prayer-givers
delivered
prayers
thereafter
in
2009,
'10,
'11
and
'13.
on
the
sectarian
points,
clearly
the
line--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
approximately.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
once
a
month.
and
on
the
sectarian
line,
i
just
like
to
point
the
court
to
the
senate
brief,
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
senators,
pages
8
to
17
which
shows
the
extensive
history
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
until
today
of
prayer
in
congress.
that
would
be
sectarian
and
unconstitutional
under
respondent's
position.
with
respect
to
coercion,
it's
unquestionably
true
that
there
is
less
basis
for
claiming
coercion
here
than
there
was
in
marsh.
in
marsh,
senator
chambers
was
required
to
be
on
the
senate
floor
by
rule,
he
had
to
be
there
to
do
his
job
and
the
practice
was
to
stand
every
single
time,
which
he
did
because
he
felt
coerced
to
do
it;
whereas,
here,
the
record
suggests
that
there
were
three
times
when
somebody
requested
people
to
stand
out
of
121
occasions.
the
idea
that
this
is
more
coercive
than
marsh
is
absurd.
in
marsh
the
court
expressly
rejected
a
coercion
argument
saying,
"we
expect
adults
to
be
able
to
deal
with
this.
"
with
respect
to
the
history,
as
well,
i
think
the
debate
in
the
continental
congress,
when
this
issue
was
first
raised,
shows
what
the
american
tradition
has
been.
that
is
americans
are
not
bigots
and
we
can
stand
to
hear
a
prayer
delivered
in
a
legislative
forum
by
someone
whose
views
we
do
not
agree
with.
that
is
the
tradition
in
this
country,
and
that's
why
it
doesn't
violate
the
establishment
clause.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
municipality
rather
than
a
state
or
local
--
federal
government.
that
can't
possibly
make
a
difference
as
an
establishment
clause
matter.
it
makes
no
sense
to
suggest
that
a
prayer
at
the
local
level
is
more
dangerous
for
establishment
clause
purposes
than
what
congress
is
doing.
only
congress
could
establish
a
religion
for
the
entire
nation,
which
is
the
core
preventive
purpose
of
the
establishment
clause.
to
suggest
that
there
are
greater
restrictions
on
municipalities
makes
no
sense
at
all.
we
think
that
the
dangerously
overbroad
theories
advanced
by
respondents
are
at
odds
with
our
history
and
traditions,
which
we
reflect
this
tradition
of
tolerance
for
religious
views
that
we
don't
agree
with
in
the
legislative
context.
respondent's
theories
also
conflict
with
the
religion
clauses
mandate,
that
it's
not
the
business
of
government
to
be
regulating
the
content
of
prayer
and
regulating
theological
orthodoxy.
thank
you.
