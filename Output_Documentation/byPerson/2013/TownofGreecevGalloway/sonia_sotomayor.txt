justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
was
the
purpose
of
marsh
saying
that
proselytizing
or
damning
another
religion
would
be
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
unless
you
parse
the
prayers,
you
can't
determine
whether
there's
proselytizing
or
damnation.
that
is
judge
wilkinson's
point
when
he
was
faced
with
this
question,
which
is,
you
have
to,
to
do
some
parsing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
seriously,
counselor.
you
can't
argue
that
the
quote
that
justice
kagan
read
is
not
sectarian.
it
invokes
jesus
christ
as
the
savior
of
the
world.
there
are
many
religions
who
don't
believe
that.
let's
get
past
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
sectarian.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
let's
talk
about
the
context
instead
of
prayer.
if
the
chief
justice
got
up
at
the
beginning
of
this
session
and
said
“
all
rise
for
a
prayer
”,
would
you
sit
down?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
--
how
many
people
in
this
room
do
you
think
would
sit,
talking
truthfully?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
do
you
think
that
someone
who
is
sitting
in
a
small
room
where
hearings
of
this
nature
are
being
held,
when
the
guy
who's
about,
the
chairman
of
this
legislative
body,
is
about
to
rule
on
an
application
you're
bringing
to
him
or
her,
why
do
you
think
any
of
those
people
wouldn't
feel
coerced
to
stand?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
assuming
that
we
don't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assuming
--
you
hear
the
resistance
of
some
members
of
the
court
to
sitting
as
arbiters
of
what's
sectarian
and
nonsectarian,
and
i
join
some
skepticism
as
to
knowing
exactly
where
to
join
that
line.
assuming
you
accept
that,
what
would
be
the
test
that
you
would
proffer,
taking
out
your
preferred
announcement
that
this
prayer
has
to
be
nonsectarian?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
a
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
four
additional
people
after
the
suit
was
filed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
a
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
often
does
the
legislature
meet?
