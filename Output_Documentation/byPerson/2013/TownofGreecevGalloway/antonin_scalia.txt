justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
--
we
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
should
assume
--
to,
to
make
it
parallel
to
what
occurred
here
that
the
next
day
before
the
same
committee
a
muslim
would
lead
the
invocation
and
the
day
after
that
an
orthodox
jew.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
makes
a
difference
whether
it's
just
one
--
one
denomination
that
is
being
used
as
--
as
chaplain
or
open
to
various
denominations.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
but
you
--
you
had
no
problem,
mr.
hungar,
with
the
marshal's
announcement
at
the
--
at
the
beginning
of
this
session.
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.
there
--
there
are
many
people
who
don't
believe
in
god.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
is
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
understand
your
--
your
answer.
how
can
it
be
that
if
the
practice
existed
in
the
past,
it
was
constitutional?
was
it
constitutional
in
the
past?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
constitutional
in
the
past,
why
--
why
would
it
be
unconstitutional
if
the
same
thing
is
done
today,
even
without
any
past
parallel
practice.
that's
a
nice
alliteration.
is
past
parallel
practice
essential?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hungar,
what
--
what
is
the
equivalent
of
prayer
for
somebody
who
is
not
religious?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
somebody
who
is
not
religious--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
equivalent
of
prayer?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
a
moment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
agree
that
coercion
is
the
test,
however?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
is
the
test--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
atheists.
throw
in
atheists,
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
devil
worshippers?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
is
that
it
coerces,
it's
bad
because
it
coerces?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
is
--
if
coercion
is
the
test
of
the
free
exercise
clause,
why
do
we
need
a
free
exercise
clause?
if
there's
coercion
--
i'm
sorry
--
of
the
establishment
clause,
why
do
we
need
the
establishment
clause?
if
there's
coercion,
i
assume
it
would
violate
the
free
exercise
clause,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
seems
to
me
very
unlikely
that
the
test
for
the
establishment
clause
is
identical
to
the
test
for
the
free
exercise
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
coercion?
he
says,
you
know
--
he
says,
“
may
we
pray
”,
and
somebody
doesn't
want
to
pray,
so
he
stays
seated.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
laycock,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
missing
here
is
--
and
this
is
what
distinguishes
legislative
prayer
from
other
kinds
--
the
people
who
are
on
the
town
board
or
the
representatives
who
are
in
congress,
they're
citizens.
they
are
there
as
citizens.
the
judges
here
are
not
--
we're
not
here
as
citizens.
and
as
citizens,
they
bring,
they
bring
to
their
job
all
of
--
all
of
the
predispositions
that
citizens
have.
and
these
people
perhaps
invoke
the
deity
at
meals.
they
should
not
be
able
to
invoke
it
before
they
undertake
a
serious
governmental
task
such
as
enacting
laws
or
ordinances?
there
is
a
serious
religious
interest
on
the
other
side
of
this
thing
that
--
that
--
that
people
who
have
religious
beliefs
ought
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
deity
when
they
are
acting
as
citizens,
and
not
--
not
as
judges
or
as
experts
in
--
in
the
executive
branch.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
they
do
that,
so
long
as
all
groups
are
allowed
to
be
in,
there
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
an
imposition
upon
them
to
--
to
stifle
the
manner
in
which
they
--
they
invoke
their
deity.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
pick
the
groups
we're
going
to
exclude?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
baha'i,
who
else?
these
--
these
groups
are
too
small
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah,
the
atheists
are
out
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
who
else?
i
mean,
you
suggest
--
you
say
just
the
vast
majority
is
all
that
we
have
to
cater
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
good.
got
that.
number
1,
atheists.
who
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
--
that's
--
that's
really
part
of
the
issue,
whether
they're
undertaking
a
government
function
or
whether
they're
acting
as
citizens
in
a
legislative
body,
representative
of
the
people
who
bring
--
who
bring
to
that
their
--
their
own
personal
beliefs.
i
think
the
average
person
who
--
who
--
who
participates
in
a
legislative
prayer
does
not
think
that
this
is
a
governmental
function.
it's
a
personal
function.
and
--
and
that's
why
we
separate
out
the
legislative
prayer
from
other
kinds
of
prayers.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
had
an
atheist
board,
you
would
not
have
any
prayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guarantee
you,
because
it
is
a
personal
prayer
that
the
members
of
the
legislature
desire
to
make.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
prayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
"how
many
of
you
have
been
saved?
"
that's
not
a
prayer.
