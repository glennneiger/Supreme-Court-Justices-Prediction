justice
antonin
scalia
are
threats
of
violence
domestic
violence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
think
that
domestic
violence
is
different
from
violence?
wouldn't
the
simple
term
‶
violence
″,
without
the
‶
domestic
″
adjective
cover
any
physical
abuse
that
causes
harm?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
punch
somebody
in
the
nose,
is
that
violence?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
punch
somebody
in
the
nose.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
do
you
have
to
have
a
special
rule
for
if
i
punch
my
wife
in
the
nose?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
physical
action
that
hurts
somebody
is
violence,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
i
am
missing
something
here,
but
i
thought
justice
ginsburg's
question
was
not
addressed
to
the
federal
statute,
but
to
the
tennessee
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
the
federal
statute
that
uses
physical
force,
right?
what
does
the
tennessee
statute
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
causing
bodily
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
position
is
whenever
--
whenever
somebody
is
injured
by
reason
of
the
intentional
act
of
somebody
else,
that
has
been
an
application
of
violent
force.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
domestic
strife?
i
mean,
my
goodness.
all
we
have
to
find
is
domestic
strife?
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
there's
domestic
strife,
guns
are
dangerous?
justice
antonin
scalia
clearly,
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
have
to
tie
this
to
domestic
--
domestic
violence.
why
do
you
--
it's
no
different
from
physical
abuse
of
anybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
many
--
how
many
include?
just
how
many
include
mere
touching
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
those
14
that
don't
separate
it
out?
and
let's
assume
the
case
law
doesn't
--
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
are
they
covered
by
this
statute
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
touching.
just
touching,
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
we
get
to
the
common
law
meaning
of
‶
force
″?
i
mean,
the
statute
does
--
federal
statute
doesn't
say
that,
right?
the
federal
statute
says
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
of
course.
in
interpreting
the
meaning
of
a
term
in
the
definition,
you
take
into
account
the
term
that
that
definition
is
defining.
and
in
johnson
we
did
that,
and
we
always
ought
to
do
it.
and
here
the
term
that
the
definition
which
uses
the
term
‶
physical
force
″
is
defining
is
‶
domestic
violence
″.
and
to
give
‶
force
″
in
that
context
its
common
law
meaning,
which
would
include
the
mere
touching,
it
seems
to
me
is
--
is
an
abuse
of
the
principle
that
the
defining
term
must
be
--
must
be
interpreted
in
the
context
of
the
term
that
is
being
defined.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
distinguishes
johnson,
but
it
doesn't
get
rid
of
the
word
‶
violence
″,
which
is
--
which
is
what
is
being
defined.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
violence
is
being
defined
as
a
mere
touching.
i
think
that's
a
stretch.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
mistake
of
course,
right?
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
mistake
congress
has
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
wouldn't,
once
again,
congress
may
have
miscalculated.
it
may
have
thought
that
this
language,
which
it
--
which
intended,
as
you
have
described,
would
cover
a
lot
of
state
statutes.
as
it
turns
out,
it
didn't.
and
that
wouldn't
be
the
first
congressional
statute
that
didn't
achieve
what
it
thought
it
was
going
to
achieve,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
was
convicted
of
causing
violent
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
sort
of
have
two
extreme
positions
here.
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
statute
covers
mere
touching.
that's
one
extreme.
and
you're
arguing
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover
all
bodily
injury,
but
only
what,
severe
bodily
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
there
something
in
the
middle?
it
doesn't
cover
touching
but
it
covers
bodily
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
you
would
lose,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
soap
in
the
eyes.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
soap
in
the
mouth?
i've
had
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
none
of
those
things
would
be
done
intentionally,
so
they
--
they
don't
scare
me.
but
--
but
i
do
think
of
a,
you
know,
a
parent
washing
out
a
child's
mouth
with
soap
for
--
for
improper
speech
or
a
--
a
mother
pinching
a
child
in,
you
know,
to
bring
the
child
under
control
in
public.
and
that
inflicts
pain.
it
inflicts
injury.
and
i
worry
about
that
being
covered
by
--
by
this
federal
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
--
really
you
have
no
answer
to
johnson,
except
that
--
that
statement
was
dictum.
and
it
was
--
the
case
did
not
have
to
define
the
precise
amount
of
injury
necessary,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
assume
that
your
point
is
it's
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
that
--
that
someone
who
has
not
really
been
guilty
of
violent
action
would
not
expect
that
he's
covered
by
the
--
by
the
prohibition
on
carrying
a
gun.
he
is
not
a
violent
person.
