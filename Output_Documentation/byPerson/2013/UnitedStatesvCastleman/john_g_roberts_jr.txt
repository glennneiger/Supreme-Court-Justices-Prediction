chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-1371,
united
states
v.
castleman.
ms.
sherry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that
point.
are
you
saying
the
first
episode
of
domestic
violence
wouldn't
qualify?
you
keep
talking
about
a
pattern
of
behavior.
i
assumed
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
it
is
the
very
first
incident
of
misdemeanor
domestic
violence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
are
you
talking
about
--
why
are
you
talking
about
patterns
of
domestic
violence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
you
cannot
cause
bodily
injury
without
using
physical
force?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
victim
is
at
the
top
of
the
stairwell
and
you
go
‶
boo
″,
and
he
or
she
falls
down
and
is
injured,
is
that
physical
force?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
not
a
limiting
term
at
all.
anytime
anything
happens,
you
would
say
there
is
physical
force
involved.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
i
did
the
same
thing
to
two
different
people
and
one
is
injured
and
the
other
isn't,
i
am
using
physical
force
one
time
but
not
the
other
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
the
actual
physical
force
being
applied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
if
they
bump
against
the
wall
and
that
injures
somebody
but
doesn't
injure
another
person,
it's
use
of
physical
force
in
one
case
but
not
the
other?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
only
one
was
injured.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i'm
having
trouble
grasping
the
concept.
if
somebody
is
lying
down
and
somebody
goes
behind
them
and
says
boo
and
they
have
a
heart
attack
and
die,
is
that
physical
force?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
might
not
include
scaring
the
person
and
the
person
having
a
heart
attack.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
doesn't
that
assume
the
conclusion
of
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
still
owe
justice
breyer
an
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
ms.
sherry,
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
