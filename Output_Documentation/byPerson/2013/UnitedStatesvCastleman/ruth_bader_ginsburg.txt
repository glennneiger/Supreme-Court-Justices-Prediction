justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
no
problem
with
the
description
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
routine
conduct
that
was
prosecuted
only
as
a
misdemeanor.
but
the
--
the
words
that
congress
used
has,
as
an
element,
the
use
of
physical
force.
under
the
tennessee
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
have
to
have
physical
force.
you
have
to
cause
bodily
injury
to
another,
which
can
be
caused
by
a
means
other
than
physical
force.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
your
view,
and
i
think
you
said
this
in
your
brief,
but
what
constitutes
violent
conduct?
so
you
said
not
scratching,
not
bruising,
not
slapping.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
i
asked
you
the
question,
you
--
you
were
hesitant
about
scratching,
bruising,
slapping.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
you
reading,
it
seems
that
one
thing
that
congress
really
wanted
to
cover,
it
didn't;
that
is,
the
--
the
defendant
has
brutally
beaten
the
mother
of
his
child.
but
under
the
tennessee
statute,
you
would
say
that
that
doesn't
qualify
as
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
means
that
on
your
interpretation,
we
leave
out
the
one
thing
that
we
know
congress
wanted
to
cover.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view
if
instead
of
domestic
violence,
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence,
the
statute
said
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
abuse?
