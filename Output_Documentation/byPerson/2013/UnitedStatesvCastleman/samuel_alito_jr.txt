justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
one
of
respondent's
arguments
is
that
congress
may
have
enacted
this
on
the
assumption
that
we
were
not
going
to
go
off
with
this
modified
categorical
approach
that
we
have
created.
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
realize
that
in
this
area
we're
supposed
to
forget
anything
about
what
we
might
actually
know
about
the
real
world,
but
are
there
really
a
lot
of
cases
in
which
one
spouse
is
convicted
for
offensive
touching
of
another
spouse?
if
i
search
the
books,
will
i
find
these?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
the
facts--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--are
that
there
is
nothing
more
than
an
offensive
touching?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
want
to
send
congress
back
to
the
drawing
board,
what
could
they
do?
i
mean,
they
are
stuck,
because
they
have
the
laws
of
the
states
that
are
framed
the
way
the
laws
of
the
states
are.
and
how
are
they
going
to
--
and
they
can't
--
and
if
they
can't,
if
they
are
stuck
with
this
modified
categorical
approach,
how
could
they
identify
those
state
prosecutions
that
fall
within
the
parameters
s
that
you
just
outlined?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
other
than
that,
what
could
they
do?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
would
you
--
how
would
you
identify
those
without
changing
the
assault
and
battery
statutes
of
the
--
of
the
50
states?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
all
the
states
would
have
to
go
back
and
change
their
statutes
in
order
to
--
to
segregate
the
cases
that
within
the
parameters
that
you--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
you
think
are
required.
