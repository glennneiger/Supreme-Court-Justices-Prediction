justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
you
about
that
ms.
sherry?
if
--
i
mean,
suppose
we
accepted
your
argument
as
to
bodily
injury,
but
offensive
touching
just
went
too
far.
what
happens?
how
are
the
laws
of
the
50
states
constructed?
are
we
going
to
have
--
are
you
going
to
have,
a
terrible
difficulty
prosecuting
real,
you
know,
punch-in-the-nose
kinds
of
incidents
of
physical
violence,
because
there
are
indivisible
statutes
that
apply
to
both?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
presumably,
if
they're
divisible,
you
don't
have
a
problem.
the
only
time
you're
going
to
have
a
problem
--
and,
again,
i'm
assuming
that
the
court
will
say
physical
touching
goes
too
far,
that
that's
not
included
under
922.
so
you'll
have
a
problem
as
to
any
state
statute
that
indivisibly
makes
illegal
both
--
both
offensive
touching
and
more
violent
forms
of
activity.
how
many
statutes
are
like
that?
justice
elena
kagan
of
the
28
states,
if
i
could
just
understand
this--
justice
elena
kagan
--of
the
28
states,
how
many
separated
out
on
the
face
of
the
statute
as
between--
justice
elena
kagan
--offensive
touching
and
bodily
injury?
justice
elena
kagan
how
does
marital
rape
figure
in
this?
in
a
--
is
a
marital
rape
considered
a
bodily
injury,
or
is
that
actually
--
could
that
fall
under
the
offensive
touching?
justice
elena
kagan
of
course,
that's
the
same
language
as
was
in
johnson,
but
you
would
be
asking
us
to
apply
it
differently
here.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rothfeld,
i
thought
that
what
johnson
said,
it
defined
physical
force
as
force
capable
of
causing
physical
pain
or
injury
to
another
person.
it
didn't
say
anything
about
serious
pain
or
grievous
injury.
it
just
said
force
capable
of
causing
physical
pain
or
injury
to
another
person.
that's
what
johnson
said.
why
would
we
adopt
a
different
approach?
justice
elena
kagan
no.
i
mean,
it
specified
it
is
not
involving
any
level,
that
--
that
there
was
no
inquiry
into
level.
it's
force
capable
of
causing
physical
pain
or
injury
to
another
person.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
the
clear
standard
in
the
holding.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sherry
said
14.
and
is
that
your
view,
too?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rothfeld,
how
serious
do
you
think
the
injury
has
to
be?
what
--
what
counts
as
serious
enough
injury?
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
rothfeld,
this
might
go
back
to
our
difference
on
what
johnson
said.
but
you're
asking
us
to
apply
a
higher
standard
than
johnson,
which
just
said
force
capable
of
causing
physical
pain
or
injury
to
another
person
without
any
notion
of
seriousness
or
grievousness
or
whatnot.
and,
you
know,
i
--
i
can
see
an
argument
that
says
we
should
apply
the
exact
same
standard
as
johnson.
i
can
see
an
argument
that
says
actually,
we
should
apply
a
lower
standard
because
this
is
misdemeanors
rather
than
felonies,
but
i
guess
i
can't
see
an
argument
about
why
we
should
apply
a
higher
standard
than
johnson.
