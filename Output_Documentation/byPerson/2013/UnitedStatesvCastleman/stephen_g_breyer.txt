justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excuse
me.
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
it,
it's
certainly
true
that
congress
did
intend
to
get
misdemeanor
domestic
felonies.
that's
what
they
said.
and
as
it
works
out
in
the
states,
if
you
take
the
same
definition
in,
there
would
be
very,
very
few
states
with
misdemeanors
of
domestic
violence
that
would
be
covered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
believe
that
congress
wanted
to
write
a
statute
that
did
so
little.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
people
who
don't
read
legislative
history
don't
know
that,
but
if
you
did
read
the
legislative
history,
you
would
see
that
they
do
want
to
have
an
effect
with
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
your
reading,
what
would
it
have
accomplished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
with
you
on
the
tough
--
what
they
were
thinking.
but
now
what
i
want
to
know,
and
you've
read
all
these
briefs
and
--
and
you've
actually
done
a
lot
of
work
on
this.
so
--
so
if
you
adopt
your
definition,
you
know,
making
them
parallel,
how
many
state
domestic
violent
misdemeanor
statutes,
in
how
many
states
would
this
cover
it,
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
because
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
--
quite
a
few,
actually,
of
the
statutes
that
they
cite
have
different
categories
and
some
of
the
categories
would
escape
being
covered
by
offensive
touching
and
others
wouldn't.
so
i
thought
you
might
--
on
that
assumption,
if
you
win
this
case,
then
how
many
states
would
be
--
how
many
states
would
have
written
their
statutes
so
generally
that
it
wouldn't
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
provision
we
are
talking
about
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
‶
substantial
″,
i
mean,
you've
read
all
these
and
do
you
have
he
an
idea
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you've
thought
about
this
question,
so
you
must
have
some
rough
idea.
you
could
put
a
range
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume,
just
to
help
you
for
a
change
--
i
mean,
not
for
a
change,
you
help
a
lot.
but
the
question
in
my
mind
is,
can
you
imagine
losing
this
case,
hypothetically,
just
on
a
hypothetical,
and
that
the
court
were
to
say,
just
as
justice
scalia
said,
and
the
offensive
touching
does
not
fall
within
the
definition
of
physical
force,
but
touching
that
produces
bodily
injury
does.
now,
were
we
to
say
that,
then
can
you
give
me
a
rough
answer
to
my
numerical
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
what
we
do
is
where
it's
--
where
it's
inseparable,
where
it
comes
in
two
separate
clauses,
then
modified
categorical
approach
applies.
and
--
and
that
being
so,
the
only
states
where
domestic
violence
wouldn't
be
included
would
be
those
that
have
a
crime
and
use
general
language
that
you
can't
divide
in
the
statute
and
cover
both
bodily
injury
and
defensive
touching.
and
are
--
are
there
some
such
states?
there
must
be
some--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
how
--
now,
just
drawing
on
your
criminal
justice
experience,
say
whether
my
sentence
i'm
about
to
utter
is
true
or
false.
that's
what
i'd
like
to
know.
the
--
the
many
statutes,
which
include
in
the
same
section,
the
physical
injury
and
the
offensive
touching,
such
as
arizona,
you
intentionally
or
knowingly
cause
physical
injury
or
knowingly
touching
another
person
with
intent
to
injure,
insult,
et
cetera.
what
we
will
find
when
we
look
back
at
the
record
of
the
prior
convictions,
it
will
say
charge
arizona
revised
statute
13-1203(a),
pled
guilty.
and
we'll
have
no
idea
which
it
was.
and
--
and
that
is
a
general
problem
with
this
area.
we'll
have
no
idea.
now,
is
that
generally
true
what
i've
just
said,
or
false?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
don't
see
--
i
think
it
is
generally
true,
too,
and
i
can't
work
this
out.
i
mean,
we'll
work
it
out,
i'm
sure.
but
look,
on
the
--
on
the
one
hand,
if
you
just
can't
know,
as
is
often
true,
then
on
the
one
hand,
you're
not
really
picking
up
serious
domestic
violence.
you
see
where
there
was
serious
domestic
violence.
and
--
and
although
it
was
under
a
general
charge
and
so
the
person
has
a
gun.
even
did
he
really
beat
the
spouse
up
and
so
forth.
or
on
the
other
hand,
you
pick
up
the
offensive
touching,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
so
what
is
your
view
after
all
this
practice
in
this
area?
what
would
you
recommend?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
remind
me
of
something
which
i
--
if
you
interpret
this
broadly,
to
include
battery,
suppose
you
do
it.
then
one
consequence
is
that
the
person
cannot
later
carry
a
gun,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
also
the
case
that
there
would
flow
ineluctably
an
extra
year
15-year
prison
sentence,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
only
consequence
is
he
couldn't
carry
a
gun.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
would
say
yes,
contrary
to
your
argument,
the
same
words
do
mean
something
differently
in
the
two
sentence
--
in
the
two
sections.
physical
force
means
one
thing
for
this
purpose;
the
other
for
the
other.
i'm
not
saying
i
would
do
that.
but
just
say
if
that
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that
happened,
and
you
can
defined
the
physical
force
in
the
misdemeanor
section
as
much
broader,
would
in
fact
there
be
a
consequence
for
anyone,
other
than
not
being
able
to
carry
a
gun?
i
just
want
to
have
every
possible
consequence
in
my
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
different
definition.
it's
for
the
same
word
in
the
two
provisions.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
be
absolutely
sure;
there
is
no
consequence
other
than
the
fact
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
carry
a
gun.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
there
would
be
a
penalty,
but
would
it
enhanced
penalty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wouldn't
be
the
extra
15
years
you
would
get
for
violent
felonies.
