ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
922(g)(9)
was
enacted
to
protect
battered
women
and
children
and
to
close
a
dangerous
loophole
in
federal
law
that
allowed
domestic
abusers
to
possess
firearms.
that
loophole
existed
because
many
domestic
abusers
were
only
convicted
of
misdemeanor
offenses,
and
the
misdemeanor
offenses
they
were
most
often
convicted
of
were
assault
and
battery
crimes.
respondent
asks
this
court
to
adopt
an
interpretation
of
922(g)(9)
that
would
indisputably
exclude
the
assault
and
battery
laws
of
almost
all
of
the
50
states
and
the
district
of
columbia.
that
would
render
the
statute
a
virtual
dead
letter
from
the
moment
of
its
enactment
until
today,
and
it
would
leave
that
dangerous
loophole
wide
open.
the
statutory
text
does
not
compel
that
implausible
result.
to
the
contrary,
this
court
ordinarily
presumes
that
common
law
terms
of
art
bear
their
common
law
meaning,
and
here,
the
common
law
meaning
of
force
is
a
natural
fit.
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
define
a--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--oh,
it
certainly
is.
but
the
connotation
of
the
phrase
‶
domestic
violence
″
is
very
different
than
the
word
--
the
word
‶
violence
″
standing
alone.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
it's
certainly
different
than
‶
violent
″
when
it's
modifying
the
word
‶
felony
″.
domestic
violence
describes
a
broad
spectrum
of
abusive
behavior--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
so
both
the
word
‶
misdemeanor
″
and
the
phrase
‶
domestic
violence
″
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
abusive
behavior.
it's
characterized
by
a
pattern
of
escalating
abusive
conduct.
it
may
start
with
something
like
emotional
abuse,
include
isolating
the
person
from
friends
and
family,
include
threats
of
violence,
threatening
to
take
away
the
kids.
and
it--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--they
are,
not
in
this
--
not
with
respect
to
this
particular
statute.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
in
this
particular
statute,
congress
focused
on
a
particular
form
of
domestic
violence.
it's
well-accepted
within
the
community
that
threats
are
a
form
of
domestic
violence,
but
congress
here--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--it
would,
but,
i
mean,
domestic
violence
--
my
point
here
is
that
domestic
but
violence
has
a
different
connotation,
even
if
you
were
to
move
away
from
the
phrase
‶
domestic
violence
″,
your
honor,
this
statute
does
talk
about
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence,
and
that's
the
term
that
we
are
defining
here.
in
johnson,
this
court
recognized
that
it
normally
does
presume
that
common
law
terms
of
art
bear
their
common
law
meaning,
and
if--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i'm
sorry,
if
you
punch
somebody
in
the
nose?
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
yes,
that
is
violence.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
and
we're
not
arguing--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--it
certainly
is,
and
we
are
not
arguing
for
a
special
rule
here.
what
we're
saying
is
that--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--if
you
are
doing
it
against
a
spouse
it
is
domestic
violence,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
is
any
different.
and
the
reason
that
domestic
violence
is
different
is
because
it
is
different
than
stranger/unstranger
violence.
these
are
not
isolated
instances.
this
is
a
pattern
of
abusive
behavior,
and
it
may
start
with
more
slight
injuries.
it
may
start
even
without
any
physical
violence
at
all.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it
--
it
certainly
would
be
the
same
as
long
as
it
fit
within
the
scope
of
that
statute.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
only
to
focus
on
what
congress
was
doing
here.
congress
recognized
what
domestic
violence
was
and
it
wanted
to
intervene
at
an
early
stage
before
the
violence
escalated
and
certainly
before
it
turned
deadly,
before
the
offender
reached
for
a
gun.
and
the
fatal
flaw
in
respondent's
argument
is
it
doesn't
accomplish
any
of
those
objectives.
respondent
acknowledges
that
congress
passed
a
statute,
and
it
intended
to
accomplish
something.
it
intended
to
close
the
dangerous
loophole.
it
intended
to
take
guns
away
from
people
who
beat
and
batter
their
wives.
respondent
cannot
explain--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
our
view
is
that
it
cannot
be
caused
by
a
means
other
than
physical
force,
if
you
understand
the
definition
of
physical
force
at
common
law.
at
common
law,
physical
force
included
not
only
direct
uses
of
force
by
the
aggressor
himself,
but
also
indirect
or
subtle
uses
of
force.
so
things
like
poisoning,
for
example,
were
considered
to
involve
the
use
of
physical
force
at
common
law.
respondent
doesn't
dispute
that
understanding
of
common
law
at
page
40
of
their
brief.
instead,
what
they
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
depart
from
that
common
law
meaning
with
respect
to
the
statute.
the
court
normally
does
presume
that
common
law
terms
of
art
bear
their
common
law
meaning,
and
there
is
no
basis
to
depart
here.
this
case
is
quite
different
from
johnson
in
that
respect.
in
johnson,
the
court
was
defining
a
very
different
term,
violent
felony,
and
it
concluded
that
because
misdemeanor
--
rather
because
battery
was
a
misdemeanor
crime
both
at
common
law
and
today,
that
it
would
be
a
comical
misfit
to
adopt
a
definition
of
force
that
was
used
in
the
context
of
a
misdemeanor
and
apply
it
to
a
felony
offense.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
the
tennessee
statute
talks
about
causing
bodily
injury--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--but
you
cannot
cause
a
bodily
injury
without
using
physical
force,
and
that
is
our
point.
there
are
different
gradations
of
force--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--you
cannot
intentionally
cause
bodily
injury
without
using
physical
force.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it
is
physical
force.
it's
not
--
and
i
am
talking
about
intentional
conduct
here.
it
is
not
physical
force
from
the
aggressor
himself,
but
it
is
physical
force
when
that
individual
hits
the
ground
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
and
that
is
how
common
law
understood
the
term.
if
that
were
not
the
case,
crimes
like
murder,
for
example,
would
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
crimes
like
murder,
crimes
like
aggravated
assault,
that,
like
battery
here,
are
defined
in
terms--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--instances
where
it
is
intentional,
absolutely,
because
it
includes
not
only,
again,
direct
applications
by
the
aggressor,
but
when
the
aggressor
sets
something
in
motion
and
causes
physical
force
to
act
against
the
person
of
another.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
if
there
is
bodily
injury.
and
that's
--
here,
the
tennessee
statute
requires
there
to
be
bodily
injury.
respondent
here
was
convicted--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--you
are
using
physical
force
one
time
and
not
the
other
time
because
there
is
the
actual
physical
force
being
applied
against
the
person
of
another,
and
contrary--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--when
the
person
is
injured,
when
the
person
hits
the
ground.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
take
that
back,
i
didn't
realize
they
both
hit
the
wall.
if
they
both
hit
the
wall,
yes,
that
involves
the
use
of
physical
force,
but--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
then
they
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
tennessee
statute.
the
tennessee
statute
requires
the
intentional
causation
of
bodily
injury.
and
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
murder
example,
i
think
that
reveals
why
a
contrary
interpretation
doesn't
work
here.
crimes
like
murder
are
defined
in
terms
of
results
of
an
intentional
killing,
it
doesn't
matter
how
that
killing
occurred.
and
under
respondent's
view,
murder,
the
quintessential
violent
crime,
would
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
now,
respondent
doesn't
dispute
that.
he
says
it
doesn't
matter,
because
murder
is
a
felony
and
felons
can't
have
guns
anyway.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
--
i
think
that's
--
that
may
be
a
bit
different.
the
way
the
common
law
--
and
we're
going
back
to
the
common
law
on
this.
the
way
the
common
law
described
it
is
it
included
direct
force.
it
included
indirect
force.
it
included
any
time
that
the
aggressor
intentionally
set
something
in
motion
that
caused
force
to
be
used;
in
other
words,
directed
something
to
act
according
to
the
--
the
individual's
will.
and
so
at
common
law,
for
example,
it
would
not
distinguish
between
a
husband
who
hits
his
wife,
a
husband
who
whips
his
wife
with
a
belt,
a
husband
who
poisons
his
wife,
whether
he
shoots
at
his
wife
with
a
gun
or
whether
he
lures
her
into
the
middle
of
the
street
so
she's
--
so
that
she's
hit
by
an
oncoming
bus.
at
common
law,
all
of
those
different
--
all
of
those
different
examples
of
conduct
were
forms
of
common
law
battery.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i'm
not
sure
if
the
common
law
would
include
that.
and
our
argument
here
is
that
if
it
was
common
law
battery,
that
it
would
be
included
within
the
scope
of
this
statute,
because
the
common
law
defined
battery
as
the
unlawful
use
--
or
unlawful
application
of
force
and
that's
precisely
how
congress
chose
to
define
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
that
has
been
an
application
of
violent
force.
that
is
our
position.
that
was
the
position
at
--
at
common
law,
although
common
law
didn't
require
violent
force.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
we
don't--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--right.
and
we
--
we
obviously
do
not
think
violent
force
is
required
here,
but
we
think
whether
or
not
violent
force
is
required,
that
yes,
the
intentional
causation
of
bodily
injury
does
require
the
use
of
force.
and
if
i
could
try
again
to
go
back
to
the
murder
example.
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
a
federal
statute,
18
usc
373(a),
we
cite
this
at
page
15
of
our
reply
brief,
it
is
solicitation
to
commit
a
crime
of
violence
and
it
uses
language
very
similar
to
the
language
we
have
here
in
that
it
requires
the
felony
that
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
now,
we
use
that
statute
to
prosecute
murder-for-hire
cases,
cases
in
which
individuals
solicit
the
murder
of
federal
officials,
of
federal
lawyers,
of
federal
judges.
under
respondent's
interpretation,
those
offenses
cannot
be
prosecuted
under
that
statute
because
murder
would
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
physical
force.
that
defies
common
sense.
and
it's
not
just
murder.
things
like
aggravated
assault,
aggravated
battery
causing
serious
bodily
injury
would
not
count
under
respondent's
view
under
a
variety
of
different
statutes,
including
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
violent
acts
like
--
against
a
person
like
murder,
like
aggravated
assault,
are
precisely
what
congress
intended
to
cover
under
the
--
as
an
element
clause
in
a
variety
of
different
statutes,
including
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
in
coming
back
to
this
particular
statute,
922(g)(9)
again
was
intended
to
accomplish
something,
and
respondent's
interpretation
would
read
all
meaning
out
of
its
statute.
it
would
be
inoperative
nationwide.
respondent
does
not
dispute
that.
he
comes
up
with
perhaps
6
states
that
may
have
assault
and
battery
laws
that
may
be
covered
under
his
definition.
on
further
inspection,
most
of
them
are
not
covered
under
his
definition.
but
even
accepting
that
a
few
states
remain,
congress
did
not
pass
this
statute
to
ensure
that
domestic
abusers
are
disarmed
in
idaho,
in
new
mexico,
in
utah
and
those
that
happen
to
strangle
their
wives
in
iowa.
congress
was
trying
to
solve
a
nationwide
problem,
a
serious
problem.
as
the
court
recognized
in
hayes,
domestic
strife
and
guns
are
deadly
nationwide,
and
congress
wanted
to
solve
that
problem
with
a
nationwide
solution.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
that's
not
what
i'm--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--that
--
that
is
not
what
i'm
saying.
what
i'm
saying
is--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--congress
certainly
had
in
mind
assault
and
battery
offenses.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
the
quintessential
domestic
violence--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--in
this
statute,
congress
was
focused
specifically
on
people
who
harm
their
family
members,
the
very
people
that
they're
supposed
to
protect.
and
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
solve
is
because
these
were
family
members,
these
individuals
were
often
not
prosecuted
as
felons,
they
were
prosecuted
and
convicted
of
misdemeanors
offenses;
and
that
is
why
they
were
able
to
get
a
gun.
when
congress
passed
this
statute,
it
sought
to
close
that
loophole.
it
was
well
accepted
that
assault
and
battery
offenses
are
the
types
of
offenses
that
domestic
abusers
are
most
often
convicted
of.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
don't
think
it
can
be,
because
i
think
the
court
has
adopted
both
the
categorical
approach
and
its
modified
categorical
variant,
largely
at
least
starting
in
taylor,
as
a
means
of
statutory
interpretation.
and
so
it
seems
odd
to
me
to
say
that
the
enacting
congress
would
have
been
surprised
when
a
court
actually
interpret
the
statute
according
to
congress's
intent.
it
chose
element
language
in
the
statute.
and
respondent
certainly
does
not
argue
that
courts
shall
be
plying
--
applying
a
fact-based
approach.
that's
not
what
this
court
said
in
hayes.
and
so
if
you
think
congress
didn't
enact
a
fact-based
approach,
it
seems
a
little
bit
odd
to
say
that
congress
may
have
thought
that
is
actually
what
it
did
in
this
case.
and
respondents
do
not
dispute
that
the
modified
categorical
approach
wouldn't
mitigate
any
of
the
practical
harms
here.
respondent's
argument
is
not
specific
to
offensive
touching
statutes
and
includes
the
statute
we
have
here,
which
is
a
bodily
injury
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
laws
of
all
--
nearly
all
50
states,
it's
one
of
the
two
variants.
it's
either
offensive
touching
or
bodily
injury,
and
in
most
cases
both.
and
respondent's--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--well,
you're
going
to
have
real
difficulty
prosecuting
in
about
28
states
and
the
district
of
columbia.
28
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
define
their
assault
and
battery
laws
with
reference
to
common
law
battery.
and
in
those
states,
there
will
--
the
first
question
will
be
whether
or
not
the
statutes
are
divisible.
some
of
them
are
codified
in
the
statute;
some
are
still
common
law
crimes
that
are
defined
by
the
courts
in
those
states.
so--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--it
--
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
--
by
divisible.
and
i
think
that's
going
to
depend
in
part
on
--
on
case
law
in
those
states
as
to
whether
they
treat
them
as
separate
crimes,
in
other
words,
separate
elements,
or
whether
they
treat
them
of
different
--
different
means
of--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--28
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
include
mere
touching.
and
even
if
the
statutes
were
divisible,
we
would
still
have
a
serious
problem,
because
in
a
lot
of
those
states,
the
state
record
is
not
going
to
make
it
clear
the
basis
for
the
conviction.
that
was
true
in
johnson.
florida
was
a
statute
that
had
different
prongs,
including
bodily
injury
and
offensive
touching.
the
reason
the
court
in
johnson
focused
on
offensive
touching
was
because
the
state
court
record
there
did
not
make
clear
the
basis
for
conviction.
it
was
true
in
hayes
with
respect
to
the
west
virginia
statute.
and
if
you
look
at
most
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
have
dealt
with
this
issue,
it
is
true
in
many
of
those
cases
as
well.
it
is
certainly
common
for
states
to
charge
the
least
common
denominator.
now,
just
because
someone--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--sure.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
believe--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
think
there's
14
that
separated
out
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
14
that
are
--
are
common
law.
whether
those
--
those
--
whether
those
states
actually
separated
out
in
terms
of
the
case
law,
i'm
not
entirely
sure.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
well,
we
--
yes.
we
think
they
are
--
we
think
they
are
all
covered
by
this
statute,
because
we
think
that
violent
force
is
not
required,
which
is
our
--
our
first
argument
in
this
case.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
just
touching
is.
and
we
--
and
the
reason
just
touching
is,
as
this
court
recognized
in
johnson,
is
that
was
the
common
law
meaning
of
force.
in
this
statute,
common
--
congress
did
track
the
common
law
and
adopted
the
common
law
definition
of
battery.
and
in
a
statute
that's
designed
to
protect
battered
women,
in
a
statute
that's
dealing
with
domestic
abusers
who
are
routinely
prosecuted
under
assault
and
battery
laws,
and
in
a
statute
that
does
track
the
common
law
definition
of
battery,
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
adopt
the
common
law
meaning.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
you
will
find
cases
in
which
that's
what
the
statute
says.
i
do
not
think
you
will
find--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
do
not
think--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--no,
i
don't
think
you
will
find
cases
where
a
husband
tickled
his
wife
with
a
feather
or
tapped
his
wife
on
the
shoulder
for
a
couple--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
don't
know
the
answer
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
don't
know
whether
they're
prosecuted
under
these
particular
statutes,
or
whether
they
would
be
prosecuted
under
rape
statutes.
either
--
i'm
not
entirely
sure
which
it
would
be,
but
i
think
it
certainly
is
true
if
you
looked
at
the
case
law
in
terms
of
the
facts,
you're
not
going
to
find
examples
of
someone
tapping
their
wife
on
the
shoulder.
you're
not
going
to
find
examples
of
someone
tickling
their
wife
with
a
feather.
i
mean,
these
are
wife
beaters.
these
are
people
who
are
abusing,
who
are
battering,
who
are
violently
injuring
those
people
that
they
are
supposed
to
care
for,
that
they're
supposed
to
protect,
that
they're
supposed
to
love.
i
think
it's
telling
that
respondent
can
only
cite
to
one
case
in
tennessee
that
was
prosecuted
under
the
bodily
injury
assault
statute,
and
he
says
that
that
is
the
one
case
that
shows
that
tennessee
prosecutes
nonviolent
offenses.
there,
the
man
punched
his
father,
strangled
him,
swatted
at,
scratched
at
his
mother,
twisted
his
wife's
arm,
knocked
her
to
the
ground,
all
the
while
holding
their
baby
in
his
arms.
if
that
is
the
example
of
the
nonviolent
conduct
that
is
being
prosecuted
under
tennessee
domestic
assault,
i
think
it
proves
congress's
point
and
it
explains
why
congress
did
not
want
that
individual
to
have
a
gun
at
the
ready
so
that
he
could
pick
it
up
in
the
middle
of
a
domestic
dispute
and
pull
the
trigger.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
but
if
i
can
give
two
qualifications
on
that.
in
2005,
vawa
passed
an
amendment
that,
as
a
condition
of
funding,
said
that
states
need
to
adopt
a
judicial
policy
to
provide
that
notice.
so
it's
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
it's
not
required,
but
states
are
encouraged
to
do
so
under
vawa
to
adopt
those
--
those
provisions.
and
i
believe
that
all
50
states
have
now
done
that.
the
other
thing
i
would
point
out
is
that
when
an
individual
goes
in
to
purchase
a
weapon,
he
fills
out
a
form,
an
atf
form,
4473.
and
on
that
form,
he
has
to
check
off
whether
or
not
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
and
the
form
contains
a
definitional
section,
and
in
that
section
it
defines
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence
as
a
crime
that
has
as
an
element
the
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force,
and
then
in
parentheses
it
says,
e.g.,
assault
and
battery.
and
so
any
individual
who
goes
to
purchase
a
weapon
--
respondent
here,
had
he
gone
to
purchase
the
weapons
himself
instead
of
having
his
wife
do
it,
would
have
seen
that
form
and
certainly
would
have
been
on
notice
that
his
misdemeanor
domestic
assault
offense
is
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence.
and
respondents--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
that's
how
--
that
the
court
should
decide
that
legally,
but
in
terms
--
if
there
is
any
concerns
about
notice,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
atf
form
that
individuals
fill
out
when
they
go
to
purchase
a
weapon
specifically
refers
to
assault
and
battery,
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
it's
because
assault
and
battery
are
the
quintessential
domestic
violence
crimes,
and
they're
allowed--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
it
--
and
it
defines
what
that
means.
so
it
defines
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence,
and
this
is
at
921(a)(33)(a).
it's
on
1a
of
the
government's
brief.
and
the
way
it
defines
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence
is,
"a
misdemeanor
under
federal,
state,
or
tribal
law
and
has
as
an
element
the
use
or
attempted
use
of
physical
force,
or
the
threatened
use
of
a
deadly
weapon.
"
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it
is
very
similar
language
to
johnson.
certainly
the
use
of
physical
force
language
is
the
same.
and
yes,
we
would
be
asking
for
an
interpret
--
a
different
interpretation
here.
johnson
expressly
left
this
question
open.
in
johnson,
the
government
argued
that
an
interpretation
requiring
violent
force
would
be
a
real
problem
with
respect
to
enforcement
of
922(g)(9).
and
when
we
said
it
would
be
a
real
problem
there,
it
was
with
respect
to
the
offensive
touching
states.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
in
johnson,
acca
does
also
use
‶
physical
force
″.
this
court
read
physical
force
to
mean
violent
physical
force,
but
the
reason
it
read
that
to
mean
violent
physical
force
was
the
two
reasons
your
honor
mentions,
the
fact
that
it
was
a
felony
definition
there,
and
the
fact
that
it
included
the
word
‶
violent
″,
not
only
standing
alone,
but
violent
defining
the
word
‶
felony
″.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
because
of
the
nature
of
this
provision.
because
of
the
term
that
is
being
defined
in
johnson,
the
court
relied
heavily
on
the
fact
that
the
term
being
defined
there
was
‶
violent
felony
″.
and
when
it--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--your
honor,
if
i
could
answer
quickly,
and
then
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
i'd
point
out
two
different
things.
in
addition
to
the
phrase
‶
domestic
violence
″,
which
we
think
does
have
a
different
connotation,
it
is
referring
to
a
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence,
and
a
misdemeanor
is
quite
distinct
from
a
felony
when
you're
talking
about
a
definition
that
was
used
as
misdemeanor
at
common
law.
and
the
last--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
i
think
it
does--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--again,
i
think
domestic
violence
has
a
different
connotation,
and
it's
also
a
fundamentally
different
statutory
scheme.
this
is
not
acca.
this
is
a
gun
prohibition.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
have
four
points.
number
one,
justice
breyer,
you
are
exactly
right
and
it
does
mean
something
different
in
this
statute.
justice
kagan,
it
is
a
lesser
definition
of
physical
force.
there
is
--
this
is
a
misdemeanor
offense,
it's
not
a
felony
offense.
common
law
misdemeanor,
understanding
of
physical
force
applies
directly
here.
it's
a
perfect
fit,
unlike
in
johnson.
also
this
is
a
fundamentally
different
statute.
this
is
not
acca;
we're
not
talking
about
a
15-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
a
consequence
in
acca
of
saying
it's
not
a
violent
felony
means
there's
no
mandatory
minimum,
but
the
individual
still
cannot
possess
a
gun,
and
a
sentence
in
court
can
still
take
prior
convictions
into
consideration.
this
is
a
gun
prohibition
that
applies
equally
to
nonviolent
felons,
to
drug
addicts,
the
mentally
ill,
and
other
classes
of
individuals
that
congress
thought
could
not
be
trusted
to
possess
a
gun.
the
second
point,
we're
talking
about
criminal
convictions
here.
these
are
events
that
are
serious
enough
to
require
police
intervention
and
to
have
someone
prosecuted
to
a
successful
conviction.
and
so
if
you
look
through
the
cases,
these
are
not
examples
of
husbands
tapping
their
wives
or
giving
them
a
paper
cut
or
stubbing
their
toe.
these
are
cases
of
real
domestic
abuse.
and
the
third
point
is
one
of
the
fatal
flaws
in
respondent's
argument,
he
acknowledges
the
legislative
history.
he
acknowledges
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
guns
away
from
violent
individuals.
but
these
violent
individuals
who
are
convicted
of
misdemeanors
are
not
convicted
of
misdemeanors
in
the
abstract.
they're
actually
convicted
of
violating
certain
state
laws.
and
the
state
laws
that
exist,
the
state
laws
that
are
on
the
books
do
not
qualify
as
misdemeanor
crimes
of
domestic
violence
in
his
--
under
his
interpretation.
and
the
fourth
point
is
i
would
encourage
the
court
to
look
at
the
state
statutes
that
we
do
cite
in
the
appendix.
and
i
would
disagree,
i
do
not
think
they
can
be
broken
down
in
the
way
that
respondent
suggests.
certainly,
in
their
brief,
they
don't
point
to
any
examples
where
any
of
those
state
statutes
would
qualify
under
their
definition,
which
would
exclude
not
only
offensive
touching,
but
would
also
exclude
bodily
injury
cases
like
the
one
at
issue
here.
and
we're
not
talking
about
just
the
generic
assault
and
battery
laws.
in
appendix
c
and
d
of
our
brief,
we
also
cite
domestic-specific
--
domestic
violence
laws,
domestic
assault,
and
domestic
battery
laws.
and
it
is
quite
perverse
to
think
that
congress
adopted
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
take
guns
away
from
domestic
abusers
and
chose
to
define
misdemeanor
crime
of
domestic
violence
in
a
way
that
not
only
excludes
generic
assault
and
battery
laws,
but
also
excludes
most
domestic
assault
and
battery
laws.
the
practical
effect
here
is
far
worse
than
in
hayes.
in
hayes,
it
would
have
been
a
dead
letter
in
two-thirds
of
the
state.
here
we
are
talking
about
virtually
the
entire
country.
maybe
a
few
states
survive,
but
at
best,
that
is
all
that
survives.
the
modified
categorical
approach
is
no
help
here
with
respect
to
all
of
those
states.
now,
with
respect
to
the
offensive
touching
issue,
i
just
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
court
with
the
impression
that
we're
arguing
just
for
bodily
injury
assault
here.
we
do
not
think
the
johnson
definition
applies
here.
we
think
a
different
definition
of
physical
force
should
apply,
and
we
think
the
consequences
of
adopting
the
johnson
definition
are
significant.
it's
28
states.
it's
the
district
of
columbia.
maybe
they're
divisible;
maybe
they
are
not.
and
even
if
they
are,
justice
breyer,
you're
absolutely
correct
that
if
you
looked
at
the
state
court
records
in
this
case
--
these
cases,
in
most
cases,
it
is
not
going
to
identify
the
actual
crime
of
conviction.
and
so
in
those
cases,
it
is
going
to
be
a
virtual
dead
letter,
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
in
hayes.
in
hayes,
it
wasn't
nationwide;
one-third
of
the
states
had
domestic
violence
laws
on
the
books.
so
it's
similar
to
hayes.
it's
similar
to
nijhawan.
it's
similar
to
what
this
court
said
in
taylor
when
it
rejected
the
common
law
definition
of
‶
burglary
″.
and
the
last
point
is
that
this
court
has
a
choice.
it
can
either
embrace
the
common
law
meaning
of
force
and
ensure
that
people
who
harm
those
that
they
are
supposed
to
protect
do
not
have
guns,
or
it
can
depart
from
the
common
law,
which
it
does
not
normally
do,
and
render
922(g)(9)
a
virtual
dead
letter.
