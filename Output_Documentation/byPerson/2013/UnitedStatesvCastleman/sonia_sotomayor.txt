justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
a
little
bit
concerned
about
going
to
that
common
law
meaning.
why
don't
you
go
to
what
the
common
law
meaning
of
domestic
violence
is?
i
thought
that
was
your
strongest
argument.
because
isn't
that
different
than
just
violence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
misdemeanor
domestic
violence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
pinching
or
biting,
hair
pulling,
shoving,
grabbing,
hitting,
slapping;
would
those
be
violence
or
would
they
be
domestic
violence
if
you
are
doing
it
against
a
spouse?
would
they
in
all
situations
be
violence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
violent
force.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
statutory
term
is
physical
force.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
johnson
relied
on
a
number
of
things,
but
the
two
were
the
use
of
felony
and
the
use
of
the
word
‶
violent
force
″,
which
is
not
what
this
statute
does.
it
just
--
it
uses
a
common
law
term,
the
use
of
physical
force.
that's
why
you
are
asking
us
to
import
the
common
law
in
this
context.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
asking
us
to
use
the
terms
in
their
common
law
sense
because
of
the
nature
of
this
--
of
this
provision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
suggesting
that
you
can
commit
a
crime
of
violence
because
you
have
to
use
violent
force.
you
could
commit
it
simply
by
using
an
automatic
weapon
that
requires
no
force
to
pull
the
trigger.
you're
suggesting
poisoning
isn't
covered.
you're
suggesting
that
anything
--
that
the
force
has
to
be
how
we
defined
it
in
johnson,
which
is
a
given.
but
when
the
misdemeanor
--
when
the
--
when
the
state
--
when
this
exemption
uses
the
words
or
this
requirement
uses
the
word
‶
misdemeanor
domestic
violence
″,
why
should
we
stray
from
the
common
law
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
certainly
causes
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
pushing
someone
lightly
over
a
cliff
causes
a
lot
of
injury.
do
you
seriously
think
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
include
that
common
law
meaning
of
the
use
of
force
in
their
definition
of
a
misdemeanor
for
domestic
violence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
that?
i
mean,
i
think
most
statutes
i
know
just
say
causing
physical
injury.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
doesn't
say
any
level
of
pain.
it
says
any
level
of
physical
injury.
so
assume
physical
injury
has
been
caused.
we
can
argue
on
the
margins
of
what
--
what
qualifies
as
physical
injury.
but
assuming
somebody,
like
here,
pled
guilty
to
it,
we
know
something
happened
that
was
physical
injury.
so
assume
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
think
causing
the
pain
was
intentional
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
don't
think
that
if
--
have
you
ever
had
soap
in
your
eye,
that
somebody
threw
the
soap
in
to
cause
you
pain
intentionally?
that
wouldn't
be
physical
injury
to
you?
