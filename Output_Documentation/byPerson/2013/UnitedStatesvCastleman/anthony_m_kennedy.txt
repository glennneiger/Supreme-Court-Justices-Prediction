justice

kennedy
you
take
the
position
that
the
person
with
the
camera
says,
‶
back
up
two
steps
″,
so
that
the
other
person
falls
over
the
cliff,
that's
physical
force?
justice

m.
kennedy
it's
strictly
background
information,
but
if
you
have
a
case
of
domestic
violence
of
the
aggravated
sort,
and
there's
a
plea
--
an
offer
to
plead
guilty
in
the
state
court,
as
you
understand
it,
does
the
state
court
have
the
obligation
to
say
that
if
you
plead
guilty
to
this
crime,
you
cannot
buy
a
weapon?
does
the
state
court
have
the
obligation
to
give
that
advice?
