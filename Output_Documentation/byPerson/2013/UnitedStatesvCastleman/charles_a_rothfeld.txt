mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
central
point
is
one
which
was
raised
by
justice
scalia's
last
question.
the
government
simply
pays
no
attention
to
the
language
of
the
statute
that's
at
issue
here.
the
statute
is
a
crime
of
violence.
the
government
says
that
this
act
of
violence,
this
crime
of
violence,
can
be
committed
without
someone
actually--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
are
a
couple
of
things
there,
and
let
me
try
to
unpack
it.
first
of
all,
there
are
two
separate
textual
problems
with
the
government's
approach
here.
one
is
it
is
ignoring
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
‶
violent
″
and
‶
force
″.
second
is
it's
ignoring
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
‶
use
″,
and
when
you
raise
the
question
of
poisoning
someone,
the
government
suggests
that
if
someone
is
--
if
poison
is
sprinkled
on
their
food,
you
have
used
force
because
at
the
molecular
level,
the
poison
is
going
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--there's
no
question
it
causes
injury.
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
again,
let
me
focus
on
--
there
are
two
separate
arguments.
the
question
of
whether
use
of
force
--
whether
force
was
used
in
the
ordinary
sense
is
a
separate
question.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
physical
force,
violent
physical
force,
has
ordinary
meaning
and
whether
--
as
opposed
to
--
to
the
common
law
meaning
of
battery
is
a
separate
question.
focusing
on
that
first,
clearly,
we
think
congress
intended
to
adopt
in
this
statute
the
same
definition
of
physical
force
and
of
violent
force
as
it
did
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
which
is
before
this
court
in
johnson,
because
it
used
almost
exactly
the
same
language.
something
that
the
government
really
doesn't
talk
about
at
all
is
that
the
language
in
this
statute
is
based
directly
on
the
language
used
in
acca
and
the
language
previous
to
that,
which
is
used
in
18
usc
section
16,
the
generic
definition
of
crime
of
violence.
congress
took
that
definition
and
it
put
it
in
the
statute.
it
modified
it
in
one
respect,
in
a
way
which
i
think
is
quite
helpful
to
us.
it
--
it
--
it
narrowed
the
category
of
crimes
that
are
covered
here.
under
the
--
the
acca
definition,
it
--
a
violent
felony
is
a
crime
that
involves
the
use,
attempted
use,
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
our
statute
says
the
use,
attempted
use
of
physical
force
or
a
threatened
use
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
first--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
i
will
agree
with
sort
of
both
of
those
--
that
congress
does
make
mistakes.
but
congress
certainly
intended
to
accomplish
something
here.
let
me
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--first
of
all,
what
congress
meant
to
accomplish
here
is
--
i
have
to
take
issue
with
my
friend
ms.
sherry.
i
don't
think
what
congress
meant
to
accomplish
here
was
to
incorporate
the
common
law
definition
of
assault.
what
--
congress
was
quite
clear,
if
you
do
look
at
the
legislative
history,
what
they
were
concerned
about
was
that
people
who
engaged
in
violent
conduct,
and
every
member
of
congress
who
spoke
to
this
talk
about
stopping
violent
people
from
getting
--
getting
guns,
people
who
were
wife
beaters
or
batterers,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
i
can,
let
me
finish
my
answer
to
your
--
to
your
prior
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it's
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind
here,
and
i
think
we
do
agree
with
the
government
on
this,
that
congress
perceived
a
loophole
in
the
law
at
the
time
because
the
firearm
restriction
at
the
time
applied
only
to
felons
and
people
who
engaged
in
violent
conduct,
as
senator
lautenberg,
the
principal
sponsor
said,
that
because
of
the
outdated
thinking
by
prosecutors,
people
who
engaged
in
violent
conduct
are
to
be
prosecuted
against
as
a
felony,
if
committed
against
somebody
else,
was
prosecuted
as
a
misdemeanor
because
a
family
member
was
the
victim.
and
so
congress
wanted
to
close
that
loophole
by
saying
people
who
engage
in
this
kind
of
violence
against
a
family
member
could
not
escape.
and
so
violent
misdemeanors
were
directed
--
were
defined
here.
and
--
and
as
senator
wellstone
very
graphically
put
it,
if
you
beat
your
neighbor's
wife
or
batter
your
neighbor's
wife,
that's
a
felony.
if
you
beat
or
battery
your
wife
or
your
child,
that's
a
misdemeanor,
and
we
have
to
get
past
that.
so
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do.
they
were
not
trying
to
broaden
the
category
of
conduct
that
was
being
criminal.
they
were
trying
to
say
that
if
you
engaged
in
violent
conduct
that
would
be
--
would
be
treated
as
a
felony
if
committed
against
somebody
else,
you
don't
get
off
the
hook
because
you
did
it
against
a
family
member.
as
to
which
statutes
are
affected
by
--
which
state
statutes
remain
as
predicates,
i
think
it's
not
entirely
clear.
the
government
focuses
in
its
statutory
appendices
on
the
generic
definitions
of
assault.
i
think
even
as
to
some
of
those,
under
a
modified
categorical
approach
some
of
them
would
--
would
satisfy
the
statutory
standard.
and
for
example--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
absolutely
right
as
an
example,
your
honor.
but
if
that
were
the
case
--
and
i'll
get
back
to
you
specifically,
justice
breyer,
but
if
--
but
if
that
were
the
case,
the
answer
cannot
be
that
--
that
we
solve
this
problem
by
extending
federal
criminal
penalties
to
people
who
lie
outside
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
that
congress
enacted
and
who
engaged
in
conduct--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it
--
i
wouldn't
categorically
say
that
those
things
do
not
qualify.
what
i
would
say,
in
johnson,
this
court
did
not
define
specifically
what
violent
force
means.
and
the
court
did
say
that
the
same
language
that
appears
in
this
statute
was
construed
in
johnson
and
the
court
there
said
it
required
violent
force,
substantial
force,
as
to
what--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
johnson
had
no
occasion
to
--
to
specify
what
level
of
force
was
necessary,
what
level
of
pain.
johnson--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
guess
i
would
have
to
respectfully
suggest
that
the
way
i
read
johnson
is
to
--
is
to
say
that
it
was
enough
for
the
court
to
decide
that
case
to
say
that
defensive
touching,
that
mere
touching
was
not
enough,
that
something
more
than
that
is
required.
and
violent
force,
substantial
force
is
required,
and
force
requiring
--
having
the
effect
of
some
level
of
pain
and
injury
satisfies
that.
i
don't
think
the
court
focused
specifically
on
what
level,
if
any
level
were
required.
and
what
johnson
did
focus
on
was
the
meaning
of
the
word
‶
violence
″.
the
court
italicized
violence.
and
if
we
look
at
the
dictionary,
violence
is
an
extreme
use
of
force,
especially
severe,
especially
powerful
use
of
force.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
get
soap
in
someone's
eyes
that
stings,
that
causes
pain,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
‶
violence
″,
that's
violent
force.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
there
are
several
categories
of
statutes
we
can
look
at.
one
is
--
is
the
generic
assault
statute
that
--
that
the
government
focuses
on.
some
of
those
--
and
look
at
the
tennessee
statute
at
issue
here,
for
example.
the
tennessee
statute
makes
causing
bodily
injury
a
violation.
it
defines
bodily
injury
to
include
a
number
of
specific
types
of
harms,
which
are
listed
disjunctively;
among
them,
for
example,
burning,
causing
disfigurement.
it's
things
like
that
seem
to
me
would
be
violent
and
if
properly
charged
in
an
indictment
under
a
modified
categorical
approach,
i
think
would
be
sufficient
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
can't
give
you
a
precise
number
to
that.
i
think
it's
a
substantial
number
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
at
least
some
dozens
of
states
that
have
use
of
force,
that
have
causing
bodily
injury,
defined
bodily
injury
to
a
list
of
things
that
one
can
do--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
some
of
those
things
are
going
to
be
necessarily
violent
things,
and
so
in
all
of
those
cases,
if
the
injury
is
inflicted
in
that
respect
and
it's
properly
charged,
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
tennessee
statute,
which
is
at
issue
here
says
‶
causing
bodily
injury
″
and
defines
separately
‶
bodily
injury
″,
and
this
appears
in--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--he
was
convicted
of
causing
bodily
injury,
but
there
was
no
specific
indication.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
are
saying
it
covers
bodily
injury
which--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
would
be
an
approach
the
court
could
take.
we
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
think
that's
inconsistent--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--several
dozens
of
states
--
well,
i
think
--
it
may
well
be
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
believe
there
are
some
states
that
use
a
common
law
standard,
as
--
as
ms.
sherry
said,
and
--
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
think
that
that's
right.
i
don't
take
issue
with
the
government's
categorization
in
their
appendix
of
the
statutes.
i
do
take
issue
with
asking
what
the
individual
statutes
mean
in
some
circumstances,
such
as
the
tennessee
statute
what
we're
talking
about
here.
i
guess
to
--
to
respond
to
justice
scalia,
we
disagree
with
a
rule
that
would
say
that
any
degree
of
pain
or
injury
necessarily
is
violent
because
we
think
that's
simply
inconsistent
with
the
meaning
of
the
word.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
tennessee
statute
--
i
have
to
take
issue
with
that,
justice
sotomayor.
the
tennessee
statute
says
bodily
injury,
but
it
defines
bodily
injury
to
include
pain.
and
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--soap
in
the
eyes.
you
know,
shampooing
a
child
and
i
get
soap
in
their
eyes
and
it
causes
them
to
sting.
that
--
that
would
be--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--in
--
in
this
case,
the
allegation--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
that
would
be
bodily
injury
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i'll
leave
that
one
alone,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
--
i
would
--
serious
injury
is
a
--
a
recognized
standard
in
the
law.
aggravated
battery
statutes,
many
of
which
are
felonies
but
not
some
of
which
are
misdemeanors,
use
that
standard.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
would
--
i
would
--
my
own
view
is
that
a
slap
in
the
face,
which
was
something
that
the
court
in
johnson
used
as
an
example,
would
be
violent.
the
difficulty
is
that
because
there
is
no
statutory
--
state
statutory
standard
saying
what
has
to
be
found,
so
long
as
the
we
have
sort
of
a
--
pain
in
a
generic
sense
was
caused,
it
could
be
the
pinch,
it
could
be
the
soap
in
the
eyes,
it
could
be
the
stubbed
toe
or
the
paper
cut
that
the
sixth
circuit
described.
we
simply
don't
know.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
is
no
question
that
those
would
be
covered
under
the
terms
of
the
text
that
the
government
is
adding.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
it
is
generally
true.
not
always
true,
but
generally
true.
but
that
is
a
--
is
a
--
to
the
extent
that
is
a
problem,
it's
a
problem--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
it's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
is
a
consequence
--
the
problem
you
identified
of
the
categorical--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--our
--
our
view
is
that
if
the
court
states
as
a
standard
what
we
believe
the
language
of
the
statute
requires,
that
there
be
violent
force
used,
that
people
will
charge
crimes
with
sufficient
specificity
in
the
indictments
so
that
it
will
allow
for
that
to
be
picked
up
and
qualified
as
a
predicate
offense
as
appropriate.
i
think
the
answer,
as
i
suggested
earlier
to
justice
scalia
and
the
chief
justice,
the
answer
cannot
be
that
because
we
have
practical
problems
in
the
application
of
this
in
some
states,
that
we're
going
to
apply
significant
federal
criminal
penalties
to
people
who
lie
outside
the
plain
terms
of
the
statutory
text
and
who
did
things
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
criminalize.
it
is,
i
think,
quite
clear,
and
this
returns
to
the
question
that
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would
say
that
if
someone
who
did
that
is
prosecuted
under
a
generic
assault
statute
that
does
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
of
force
and
the
relevance
that
is
violent
force,
then
that
--
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
i
would
take
issue
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
know
congress
wanted
to
cover
is
what
it
said
in
the
statutory
text.
it
wanted
to
cover
violent
crimes,
and
it
wanted
to
cover
people
using
simple
force
to
commit
these
violent
crimes.
it
had
in
mind
that
many
people
who
did
this
kind
of
thing
were
being
prosecuted
for
misdemeanors.
some
of
those
misdemeanors
--
i
think
i,
here
again,
take
issue
with
the
government
that
both
the
generic
assault
statutes
and
other
kinds
of
both
aggravated
assault
statutes
and
specific
kinds
of
criminal
acts
that
are
addressed
by
individual
statutes
could
be
invoked
in
situations
like
that.
and
it
may
well
be,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
that
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
it
had
a
--
it
had
a
sense
that
--
it
certainly
was
aware
that
people
were
being
prosecuted
by
misdemeanors.
i
think
it
may
well
congress
really
was
not
thinking
--
did
not
have
a
clear
sense
of
how
the
language
that
it
used
would
interact
with
modified
categorical
and
categorical
approaches
as
squared
against
the
state
statute,
how
that
would
apply.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
--
it
would
make
quite
a
difference.
the
face
--
the
fact
is,
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
this
case
and
something
the
government
ignores,
that
congress
used
the
language
virtually
identical
to
language
that
it
had
used
in
prior
statutes
like
acca,
adopting
the
language
of
‶
violence
″
as
it
had
done
in
acca,
as
it
did
in
18
u.s.c.
section
16
in
the
definition
of
--
the
generic
definition
of
crime
of
violence.
and
i
--
i
guess
this
returns
to
a
question
that
justice
sotomayor
asked
at
the
outset
of
ms.
sherry's
argument.
did
congress
mean
something
different
when
it
said
domestic
violence?
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
the
congress
used
--
defined
a
specific
crime
with
elements
that
are
identical
to
other
generic
crimes
of
violence
through
the
generic
crime
of
violent
felony,
to
the
generic
crime
of
violence
in
18
u.s.c.
16.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
i
do
not
suggest
that
you
should
apply
a
higher
standard
than
johnson.
i
will
say
two
things
about
that.
first,
in
fact,
the
definition
in
our
statute
is
a
stricter
definition.
it
covers
a
narrower
category
of
crimes,
as
i
said
before,
than
--
than
the
acca
definition
does
because
when
we
reach
threats
acca
addresses
--
you
know,
any
threat
of
use
of
force,
and
this
statute
addresses
only
a
threat
of
use
of
a
deadly
weapon,
a
much
more
serious
and
narrower
category.
so
it
clear
--
it
is
clear
that
congress
thought
about
the
definition
it
was
using
here;
it
didn't
sort
of
mindlessly
take
the
definition
that
appeared
in
acca
and
in
18
usc
section
16
and
just
kind
of
plop
it
in
there.
it
actually
thought
about
it,
decided
that
it
wanted
to
use
that
definition,
and
then
decided
that
it
wanted
to
--
type
in
that
definition.
so
i
think
for
those
reasons
the
government's
suggestion
that
we
somehow
depart
from
what
the
court
said
was
the
definition
in
johnson--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
took
that
statement
to
say
that
absent
some
infliction
of
pain
and
injury,
that's
not
enough.
that
can't
be
a
crime
of
violence
and
--
and
not
going
any
further
than
that.
the
court
then
did
go
on
to
say
in
response
to
other
arguments
by
the
government
that
a
slap
in
the
face
could
be
a
crime
of
violence.
a
slap
in
the
face
i
think
is
a
painful
thing.
it
is
not
--
it's
not
a
soap
in
the
eyes;
it's
not
a
stubbed
toe,
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
pinch.
so
i
did
not
take
johnson.
and
of
course
the
court
will
tell
us
what
it
meant.
but
i
do
not
take
johnson
to
be
meaning
to
define
definitively
a
crime
of
violence
as
being
anything
which
causes
any
de
minimis
level
of
pain
or
injury,
which
again
is
not
consistent
with
the
word
of
violence,
which
is
extreme,
unusual,
very
powerful
force.
i
guess
a
couple
of
other
small
points.
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
government's
standard,
because
the
language
that
is
used
here
is
identical
in
--
in
our
statute
and
in
acca,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
a
case
that
whatever
the
court
says
about
the
nature
of
the
injury
that
is
inflicted
that
is
sufficient
to
be
violent
force
in
this
statute
applies
in
the
violent
felon
context
as
well.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary
to
think
that,
you
know,
soap
in
the
eyes,
which
triggers
a
--
a
state
battery
prosecution
would
be
sufficient
to
qualify
as
a
violent
felony,
and
--
and
make
someone
subject
to
a
15-year
mandatory
federal
prison
sentence.
i
mean,
that
is
quite
a
remarkable
outcome.
and
because
congress
did
use
exactly
the
same
language
in
--
in
these
two
statutes,
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
adopting
the
government's
position
here.
that
it's
not
that
--
that
what
they
are
saying
is
admitted
to
the
statute.
it's
not
--
unless
one
assumes
that
congress
meant
radically
different
things,
using
the
same
language
from
a
closely
related
statute
several
years
prior
--
unless
one
--
one
takes
--
then
the
consequence
of
the
government's
reading
here
washes
back
into
the
violent
felony
definition,
and
the
mandatory
15-year
sentence.
i
think
that
can't
possibly
be
what
congress
had
in
mind.
in
response
to
a
point
that
ms.
sherry
made
about
the
wachtel
decision
from
the
tennessee
courts
that
we
cite,
we
do
not
cite
that
as
an
example
of
something
that
is
not
violent,
not
serious
crime.
we
are
simply
citing
it
for
the
standard,
the
legal
standard
that
tennessee
courts
stated
for
application
of
their
assault
statute,
and
the
nature
of
the
level
of
force
that
was
necessary
and
the
court
here
said
pushing
somebody,
scratching
somebody
would
be
sufficiently
to
a
working
crime
of
--
that
inflicts
bodily
injury.
it
is
not
theoretical,
i
should
add,
that
people
are
prosecuted
for
things
like
this
across
the
country.
in
our
brief
and
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers
briefs
cite
examples
of
people
who
are
prosecuted
for
nonserious
crimes,
including
nonviolent
crimes.
people
--
for
spitting
or
pushing
people's
hands
away.
in
tennessee
i
can't
cite
cited
cases,
reported
cases
that
involve
conduct
of
that
type
in
a
domestic
context.
i
can
say
that
people
are
arrested
in
tennessee
with
some
frequency
for
domestic
assault,
in
contexts
where
the
allegation
is
that
they
pushed,
that
they
spit,
that
they
pushed
somebody's
arm
away.
so
you
have
to
assume
that
some
number
of
these
people
are
prosecuted
and
in
this
case,
they
plead
guilty
to
make
the
case
go
away.
having
done
that,
they
are
under
now
the
government's
reading
subject
to
a
lifetime
ban
on
ownership
of
firearms.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
congress,
again
if
one
looks
at
what
the
members
said
as
they
debated
this
legislation,
they
were
concerned
with
people
who
engage
in
acts
of
violence,
wife
beaters,
with
batterers
who
are
escaping
application
of
the
firearms
limitation
they
manage
to
plead
down,
their
crime
wasn't
taken
seriously.
crimes
involving
offensive
touching
are
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well
--
they
could
modify
the
modified
categorical
approach.
i
mean
that
is
what
the
court
--
as
the
government
says.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
they
could
identify
particular
types
of
--
of
violence
that
would
qualify.
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
don't
think
that
congress
could
--
could
do
it
by
simply
absorbing
the
assault
statutes
as
they
are
written,
because
they
are
overbroad.
they
reach
well
beyond
what
congress
has--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
no,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
is
not
so,
justice
alito.
i
think
that
if
--
if
cases
were
charged
with
sufficient
specificity
in
the
indictments,
both
as
i
said
even
--
even
under
the
generic
statutes,
like
tennessee,
which
lists
types
of
injury,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to,
in
a
case
involving
conduct
of
that
kind,
to
trigger
the
predicate--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
consequence
of
this
conviction
in
this--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
that
definition
flowed
back
to
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
and
if
you
did
carry
a
gun,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
would
be
a
--
up
to
a
10-year
federal--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
true
if
the
court
said
that
the
identical
language
meant
different
things.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
i
may,
just
for
very
briefly.
that
--
that
--
that
--
that
is
correct.
it
is
as
in
this
case;
it
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
and
it
has
the
additional
consequence
of
reaching
well
beyond
what
congress
wanted
to
reach.
it
identifies
people
who
it
did
not
want
to
reach
and
it
subjects
them
to
this
penalty
and
this
prohibition.
thank
you
very
much.
