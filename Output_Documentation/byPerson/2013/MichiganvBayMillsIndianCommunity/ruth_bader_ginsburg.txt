before
you
do
that,
can
you
tell
--
tell
us
why
michigan
didn't
resort
to
the
dispute
resolution
means
that
the
compact
provided?
the
compact
said
if
there's
a
dispute
it'll
be
decided
by
arbitration.
michigan
bypassed
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
all
that
--
the
enigma
that
you
pointed
out,
or
the
anomaly
is
--
is
certainly
clear.
but
what
about
kiowa?
this
court
seemed
to
say
that
the
tribe
is
immune
on
reservation,
off
reservation,
commercial
activity,
government
activity,
it
is
immune,
blanket
immunity.
so
how
can
you
prevail
without
having
this
court
modify
kiowa?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
once
the
congress
didn't
respond,
the
majority
opinion
in
kiowa
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
“
kiowas
”
or
“
kiowa
”
--
said,
you
know,
this
is
an
unfortunate
result,
but
congress
can
do
something
about
it.
well,
now
congress
hasn't
done
anything
about
it,
and
you
are
asking
this
court
essentially
to
modify
the
--
that
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
agree
with
that,
that
they
could
--
the
state
could
go
in
and
arrest
all
the
customers
that
are
gambling
there?
could
it
seize
the
slot
machines--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
would
be
the
big
--
what
would
be
the
big
change,
other
than
modifying
kiowa,
which
is
a
divided
opinion,
and
was
dealing
with
a
money
claim.
it
wasn't
dealing
with
injunctive
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
that
right?
the
distinction
between
commercial
and
governmental,
it
was
court
made
in
the
first
instance.
and
then
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
codified
law
that
was
court
made.
so
it
was
the
courts
that
made
the
distinction
between
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity
and
acting
in
a
governmental
capacity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
katyal,
isn't
it
odd
to
say
that
when
this
is
the
court
--
the
doctrine
of
tribal
immunity
is
something
that
was
announced
by
this
court.
congress
never
passed
a
law
that
said
the
tribes
have
immunity.
it's
all
this
court.
and
then
you
say
what
this
court
made
only
congress
can
unmake.
that
seems
strange
to
me.

dependent

justice
ruth
bader

justice
alito's
question
was
the
kiowa
case.
it
was
off
reservation,
the
tribe
owed
money
on
a
contract
which
it
refused
to
pay,
and
the
court
said
sovereign
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
you
went
through
the
development
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
and
whether
the
courts
were
influenced
by
the
government,
it
was
the
courts
that
recognized
this
distinction
between
commercial
activity
and
governmental
activity.
why
couldn't
the
court
extend
that
same
distinction
to
indian
tribes
and
say
it
makes
sense
in
the
foreign
country
context,
it
also
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
the
tribes,
to
distinguish
commercial
from
governmental?
