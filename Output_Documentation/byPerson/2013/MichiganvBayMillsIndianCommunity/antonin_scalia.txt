justice

so
you
think
congress
really
wanted
the
states
to
have
power
to
stop
illegal
gambling
on
indian
lands,
but
not
to
have
the
power
to
stop
illegal
gaming
on
state
lands?
is
that
--
is
that
the
law
you
think
congress
wrote?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
anybody
want
such
a
disposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
think
that
rule
would
apply
even
when
at
the
time
the
statute
in
question
was
enacted
there
was
no
belief
that
there
was
tribal
immunity
on
state
lands?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
just
on
reservation.
you
think
that
was
off
reservation
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
kiowa
was
later,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
they
read
puyallup
that
closely?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
says
that
if
they
arbitrated,
when
they
tried
to
enforce
the
arbitral
judgment,
you
would
assert
sovereign
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's
not
an
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
statute
was
based
upon
judicial
decisions
that
had
already
held
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
took
it
upon
itself
to
accept
the
executive's
determination
of
how
it
ought
to
play
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
made
these
indian
tribe
sovereign,
was
it
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
are
appealing
to,
you
know,
other
branches'
determination.
who
decided
that
indian
tribes
are
sovereign?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
pronounced
them
to
be
sovereign?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
assume
that
this
court
could
also
determine
the
scope
of
their
sovereignty.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
do
virtually
nothing
as
a
matter
of
common
law.
we
do
virtually
everything
on
the
basis
of
the
constitution
or
statutes.
i
don't
think
that
that's
much
of
an
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
modified
it
to
make
an
exception
for
commercial
activities
off
reservation,
could
congress
reinstitute
sovereign
immunity
if
they
wanted?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we've
learned
something
in
15
years,
such
as
the
fact
that--
