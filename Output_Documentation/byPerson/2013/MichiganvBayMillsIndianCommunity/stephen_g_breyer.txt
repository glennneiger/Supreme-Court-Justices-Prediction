justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
is
this:
three
situations.
i
think
it's
the
same
question
justice
kennedy
was
driving
at.
one,
france
opens
up
a
casino.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two,
california
opens
up
a
casino.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
three,
an
indian
tribe
opens
up
a
casino,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
is
it
that
says
that
the
state
where
the
casino
is
located
can
sue
france?
what
is
it
that
says
it
can
sue
california?
all
--
they
all
object.
what
is
it
that
says
it
can
sue
the
indian
tribe?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
that
a
statute
or
common
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
california?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
all
those
are
common
law.
both--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
what
do
you
do
about
kiowa?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
but
the
question
specifically
then
--
i
think
we're
driving
at
the
same
thing
--
is,
remember,
you
just
cited
to
me
two
cases--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one
involving
france
and
one
involving
california.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
had
assumed
--
but
maybe
i
was
wrong
to
assume
--
that
when
i
read
those
cases,
i
will
see,
although
a
state
can
sue
france,
although
nevada
can
sue
california,
a
private
individual
could
not.
am
i
going
to
find
that
when
i
read
those
two
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
i
think
the
answer
to
justice
kagan
is
i'm
not
going
to
find
it.
so
we're
looking
for
authority,
back
to
justice
kennedy,
that
will
support
your
proposition
that
the
state
could
sue
france,
nevada
could
sue
california,
but
a
private
individual
could
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
then,
if
the
answer
is
what
i
now
think
you're
saying,
is
to
say
it's
awfully
complicated
that
although
a
state
could
sue
an
indian
tribe
for
something
that
is
outside
the
reservation,
the
state
--
it's
so
complicated
that
i'd
like
some
good
authority
for
it,
because
a
private
person
couldn't,
but
a
state
could
sue
and
it's
only
in
certain
places.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
about
drawing
the
line
with
kiowa?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
he
was
wrong
on
that
apparently
if
that's
what
he
says.
he
was
wrong.
that
if
we
look
at
the
cases,
what
we
will
see
is
it
was
the
courts
that
said
there's
a
common
law
abrogation
of
france's
sovereign
immunity
when
they
go
into
business
in
downtown
iowa
somewhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
same
thing
--
same
thing
with
the
state
he
says
in
nevada
and
california
and
then
he
says
it
would
be
totally
anomalous
to
think
that
an
indian
tribe
could
go
into
downtown
des
moines
and
open
up
a
clearly
illegal
business,
and
you
could
sue
france
--
the
state,
which
was
not
kiowa
--
they
could
sue
--
france
could
--
the
state
could
sue
france,
it
could
sue
california,
but
it
couldn't
sue
the
indian
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
about
the
california
and
nevada?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
kiowa
is
about
--
kiowa
is
about
individuals
who
are
not
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'll
look
at
those
with
care.
but
now,
assuming
you
are
right
on
that,
is
the
question
in
front
of
us,
on
the
assumption
that
these
are
indian
lands,
does
the
indian
tribe
have
sovereign
immunity?
is
that
the
question
you
want
answered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
us
to
say
on
that
assumption
--
now,
on
that
assumption,
i
look
at
i
and
number
ii
under
a,
7(a),
and
a
quick
reading
of
them
suggests
to
me
that
they're
in
parallel.
that
the
indian
tribe
can
sue
the
state
when
the
state
won't
open
negotiations
and
the
state
or
an
indian
tribe
can
sue
the
indian
tribe
when
the
indian
tribe
refuses
to
follow
the
compact.
now,
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know.
but
you
said
to
decide
this
on
the
assumption
that
it's
on
indian
lands.
if
i
make
that
assumption
and
then
i
look
over
and
read
romanette
i
and
romanette
ii,
it
sounds
as
if,
as
i
said,
romanette
i,
the
tribe
can
sue
the
state
to
get
the
compact.
romanette
ii,
the
state
can
sue
the
tribe
when
it
violates
the
compact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
want
to
--
i'm
trying
to
get
what
question
i'm
supposed
to
answer.
if
i'm
supposed
to
answer
the
sovereign
immunity
question
on
the
assumption
that
these
are
indian
lands
contrary
to
what
was
decided
below,
i
might
get
one
answer.
but
if
i'm
decide
--
supposed
to
do
it
on
the
assumption
that
they're
not
indian
lands,
i
might
get
a
different
answer.
what
assumption
am
i
supposed
to
make?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
prepared
to
live
with
the
following.
is
it
the
case
that
if
california
opens
a
business
in
a
commercial
activity
in
20
other
states,
at
least
one
of
which
it
is
totally
illegal,
this
other
state,
say
utah,
cannot
--
can
sue
california
or
not,
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
the
opposition
says
in
your
view
is
absolutely
correct,
that
a
foreign
nation
opens
up
an
illegal
business
in
a
state.
the
state
can
sue
them
now
because
of
a
treaty,
but
previously
because
of
the
common
law.
california
opens
up
an
illegal
business,
the
state
can
put
them
out
of
business
by
bringing
a
suit.
bust
an
indian
tribe,
they
can't?
that's
the
united
states
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
that
is
your
view,
i
just
want
the
bottom
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
you
are
representing
the
united
states.
you
understand
indian
policy.
this
case
has
tremendous
implications
if
we
follow
your
approach.
it
seems
to
me
well
beyond
anything
to
do
with
gaming.
my
belief
is
indian
tribes
all
over
the
country,
operate
businesses
off
the
reservation,
and
businesses
all
over
the
country
are
regulated.
and
does
the
state,
i
guess,
in
your
view
does
not
have
the
power
to
enforce
the
regulation
against
the
indian
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
against
the
tribe
itself.
why
is
that
in
the
indian
tribe's
interest?
and
is
it
a
trap
for
the
unwary
lawyer?
and
how
is
this
supposed
to
work
out
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
adding
one
thing,
which
is
as
you've
just
heard,
that
the
indian
tribes
are
in
the
same
eleventh
amendment
type
position
as
the
principality
of
monaco
before
the
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
participate
in
the
convention
and
the
principality
of
monaco
was
held
to
be
immune,
presumably,
even
from
commercial
activity.
let
congress
change
it.
that's
what
kiowa
says.
and
that
i
think
is
their
basic
argument.
and
if
it's
a
wash
--
i
mean,
i
hate
to
put
it
this
way
because
it
sounds
like
a
joke,
but
it
isn't
meant
to
be
--
in
this
case,
if
it's
a
wash,
follow
the
precedent.
