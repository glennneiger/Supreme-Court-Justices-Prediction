mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
where
my
friend
did
not,
with
the
text
of
the
statute.
congress
enacted
subsection
(a)(ii),
like
the
rest
of
igra,
to
address
gaming
solely
on
indian
lands.
in
fact,
congress
used
that
phrase
“
on
indian
lands
”
a
whopping
24
times
in
igra.
by
contrast,
igra
says
not
a
word
about
off-indian-lands
activity.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
do
think
so,
and
if
i
could
say
first
of
all--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--two
reasons,
your
honor,
why
i
think
congress
made
the
choice
they
did.
but
even
before
that,
i
don't
think
that's
the
proper
inquiry
for
this
court.
the
proper
inquiry
for
this
court,
as
c&l
and
other
cases
have
said,
is
it
requires
an
unequivocal
expression
of
purpose
of
congress
before
tribal
immunity
is
abrogated,
and
we
don't
get
into
this
kind
of
question
of
what
congress
might
have
thought,
which
creates
a
guessing
game.
but
just
to
answer
your
question,
why
would
congress
have
thought
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
your
honor,
i
know
my
friend
on
the
other
side
has
said
that.
that
is
just
flatly
wrong.
puyallup
in
1977,
your
honor,
precisely
said
that
it
involved
both
on
and
off-reservation
activity,
it
was
commercial
activity,
it
was
fishing,
and
this
court
said
that
tribal
immunity
protected
against
that.
so
i
do
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
is.
at
page
167,
your
honor,
it
says
that
the
injunction
was
both
on
and
off
reservation.
and
then
in
kiowa
at
page
754
this
court
made
clear
that
that's
how
it
read--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--of
course,
but
i
think
that
congress
in
enacting
igra
in
1988
certainly
was
under
the
same
set
of
assumptions
as
this
court
in
19
--
in
the
kiowa--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
it's
several
places
in
puyallup
and
certainly
that's
what
this
court
in
kiowa
said.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
i
do
think
the
text
is
the
best
guide
to
what
congress
wanted,
and
the
text
uses
“
on
indian
lands
”
24
times.
and
the
reason
for
that,
the
reason
why
there's
not
an
absurdity,
is
twofold:
first,
congress
in
igra
was
reacting
to
this
court's
decision
in
cabazon
the
year
earlier,
which
had
ousted
state
court
--
state
regulatory
jurisdiction
entirely
from
on-indian-lands
activity.
so
it
changed
the
game
entirely.
cabazon
did
nothing
with
respect
to
off-indian-lands
activity
and
left
entirely
intact
all
the
remedies
we've
been
talking
about,
justice
alito's
remedy
about
criminal
sanctions--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
it
certainly
could
arrest
the
customers,
the
employees,
and
so
on.
and
that's
why
we
would
not
operate
this
casino
without
a
square
ruling.
it
is
shuttered,
justice
alito,
right
now
because
we
need
a
square
ruling
that
says
this
is
on-indian-lands
activity.
and
we
would--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--we
think
that
that's
a
consequence
of
tribal
immunity,
that
when
they
are
seeking
relief
qua
tribe,
that's
a
different
thing,
and
that's
i
think
a
standard
principle--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
that
sort
of
circumstance
unfolded
we
might
say
let's
try
and
figure
out
a
different
way
to
deal
with
that.
first,
of
course,
the
most
primary
way
is
the
compact
itself,
and
many
compacts,
for
example,
have
arbitration
clauses--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
we
are
not
here
trying
to
say
that
we
want
to
evade
the
law.
we
want
a
ruling,
a
definitive
ruling.
we
believe
very
squarely
that
this
is
on-indian-lands
activity.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure.
as
part
in
the
district
court,
as
part
of
ordinary
discovery,
as
part
of
ordinary
litigation,
we
said
that
ex
parte
young
wasn't
applicable.
but
we
do
think,
and
our
brief
in
opposition
says
this,
our
merits
brief
says
this,
the
united
states'
brief
says
this,
that
ex
parte
young
actions
are
available
against
tribes,
just
as--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
not
assert
it
to
the
limits
of
ex
parte
young.
so,
for
example,
ex
parte
young
doesn't
--
doesn't
permit
reaching
into
the
state
coffers,
and
here
count
5
of
the
complaint
tries
to
reach
into
the
tribe's
coffers.
so
we
do
think
that
that
type
of
ex
parte
young
--
that
is
not
permitted
by
ex
parte
young
and
that
would
be
impermissible.
if
i
could
return
to
the
second
reason
why
i
think
what
congress
did
wasn't,
you
know,
creating
any
sort
of
anomaly
like
my
friend
says,
the
reason
is
this:
all
igra
did
in
(a)(ii)
is
empower
compacts.
it
didn't
abrogate
immunity
by
itself
directly;
it
requires
the
tribe
to
affirmatively
buy
into
the
idea
of
state
law
applying
on
the
reservation.
so
if
we
could,
just
imagine
a
casino,
justice
scalia,
opened
blatantly
on
a
reservation,
a
casino
without
a
compact
that
was
absolutely
illegal.
we
will
call
it
casino
rhett.
(a)(ii)
would
not
abrogate
immunity
in
that
circumstance.
the
state
would
have
no
remedy.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yeah,
on
indian
lands,
exactly.
and
so
my
example
of
the
casino
here
would
be--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
there
is
no
compact,
justice
kennedy,
there
is
no
abrogation.
and
so
what
(a)(ii)
does
is
it
empowers
the
tribe
and
the
compact,
and
it
requires
the
tribe
affirmatively
to
come
in.
and
that's
why
off
indian
land
there
is
standard
tribal
immunity
because
the
tribe
hasn't
said
anything
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yeah,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
all
1166
does
is
bring
federal
--
that's
about
federal
enforcement,
not
at
all
about
state
enforcement.
indeed,
michigan's
own
position
and
michigan's
supreme
court
said
1166
does
says
nothing
with
respect
to
states--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--which
casino?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no,
we
do.
we
think
that
the
proper
remedy
here,
if
they
had
an
objection,
would
have
been
to
arbitrate
and
say
this
is
not
indian
lands.
petition
appendix
77a
and
78a
lay
out
the
terms
of
the
compact
and
what
gaming
is
allowed.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
of
course
that
is
the
remedy
they
agreed
to
in
the
compact
itself,
and
of
course
they
should
try.
and
second--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
it
is
an
answer
in
the
sense
that,
your
honor,
had
they
asked
we
--
and
i
can
tell
you
i've
discussed
this
with
the
tribe
--
that
they
of
course
not
--
they
would
of
course
not
assert
sovereign
immunity
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
we
think
that
that
isn't
a
final
decision
and
is
wrong
for
any
number
of
reasons
on
the
merits
that,
you
know,
laid
out
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
so
we
do
think
that
would
be
the
argument
that
we
would
make
to
the
arbitration
board.
that
should
have--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well
--
no,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
that
isn't
itself
a
final
decision
and
there
are
any
number
of
mechanisms
that
may
be
available
to
try
and
get
the
issue
properly
teed
up
to
the
nigc.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
it
would
bind,
i
think,
the
parties
before
it,
and
that's
what
the
parties
agreed
to.
in
many
compacts--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
that
we
would
still
have
to
persuade
the
federal
government
in
one
way,
shape,
or
form
because
of
the
nigc's
authority
in
this
area.
so
i
think
that's
two
separate
questions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
it
at
least
resolves
the
issue
with
respect
to
michigan.
our
central
point
here
is
that
there's
lots
of
different
ways
to
deal
with
this
question,
including
the
question
you
asked
earlier,
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
which
we
brought
against
michigan.
there's
lots
of
ways
to
resolve
the
underlying
indian
lands
question.
the
last
thing
i
think
this
court
needs
to
do
is
entirely
change
the
rules
of
the
game
with
respect
to
tribal
immunity.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
certainly
this
court's
decision
in
puyallup
as
well
as
oklahoma
--
oklahoma
tax
commission
both
did
deal
with
injunctive
relief
and
both
were
against
states
to
deal
with
his
argument.
now,
he
has
said
--
my
friend
on
the
other
side
has
said
we'll
look
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
context
and
that's
what's
giving
him
his
reason
for
saying
that
it
wouldn't
be
such
a
big
change,
and
we
think
that's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
kiowa
itself,
at
page
759,
dealt
with
this
and
said
that
it
was
the
political
branches
that
led
the
change
on
commercial
immunity,
not
this
court.
and
number
two,
my
friend
has
quoted
alfred
dunhill,
and
i
think
that
everything--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
ginsburg,
the
majority
of
kiowa,
on
page
759,
responds
to
that
and
says
that
it
was
actually
the
political
branches
that
led
with
the--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and,
justice
breyer--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
breyer,
we
would
encourage
the
court
to
look
at
precisely
the
case
he
is
citing
for
this
proposition,
which
is
alfred
dunhill,
because
as
the
case
was
vigorously
argued
by
a
justice
department
attorney,
and
what
--
and
what
my
friend
doesn't
tell
you
is
that
the
pages
he
is
citing
actually
don't
command
a
majority
of
the
court.
they're
about
not
commercial
--
they're
not
about
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
they
are
about
active
state
immunity.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
in
the
california
v.
nevada,
i
think
this
court
dealt
with
in
kiowa
itself
because
in
kiowa
--
because
that's
about
basically
the
state--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yes.
exactly.
but
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
blatchford
and
in
kiowa
that
in
nevada
v.
hall
situations,
which
is
what
the
dissenting
kiowa
raised,
and
what
my
friend
is
trying
to
resuscitate,
that's
a
difference
in
circumstance
because
there
was
a
mutuality
of
concession.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
think
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
if
they
are
on
indian
lands,
yes,
there
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--when
it's
on
indian
lands,
exactly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
your
honor,
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
earlier
question,
but
certainly
our
position
is
that
you
can
look
to
our
answer
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
tribal
immunity
in
the
case.
that
is
not
something
my
friend
has
argued.
it's
outside
of
the
questions
presented
entirely,
which
both
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
off
of
indian
lands.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
think
that
it
--
i
--
i
don't
think
it
matters
either
way.
our
position
is
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
there
would
be
tribal
immunity
for
that.
just
as
if
the
blatant
casino
on
indian
lands
opened
a
casino
--
a
tribe
opened
a
casino
without
a
compact,
the
state
would
not
have
an
a2
injunctive
remedy.
and
that's
why
there
is
no
anomaly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
latter,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
that's
what
the
questions
presented
say.
and
number
two,
one
of
the
most
venerable
precedence
of
this
court
is
the
--
is
justice
holmes'
opinion
--
which
says
you
don't
look
to
our
answer
to
determine--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
suppose--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
federal
government
has
a
variety
of
mechanisms
available
to
it
in
that
circumstance,
including
closure
orders
and
the
like.
and
i
suppose
even
the
state
may
have
any
number
of
actions,
both
--
many
states
will
have
this
worked
out
in
the
compact,
but
if
they
don't
have
it
worked
out
in
the
compact,
then
there
may
be
the
possibility
of
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
i
think
that
still,
the
state
may
have
any
number
of
criminal
or
civil
remedies
available
to
it.
that
is,
off
indian
lands
--
and
this
is
why
there
isn't
an
anomaly
in
a2
--
off
indian
lands,
the
state
has
vast
regulatory
power.
igra
was
reacting
to
a
circumstance
in
which
this
court
ousted
state
regulatory
jurisdiction
on
indian
lands.
and
so
the
state
has
a
whole
bunch
of
mechanisms
available
to
it.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
do
think
so.
i
think
that
that's
--
i
think
that
that's
underlying
some
of
this,
absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well
--
well,
i
certainly
would
disagree
with
the
idea
that
you,
the
court,
should.
i
think
the
proper
response
would
be
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
kiowa,
which
is
if
there's
a
dispute
about
the
contours
of
immunity,
commercial,
off
land,
state
is
plaintiff,
all
of
that,
those
are
all
things
that
congress
is
well-suited
for
dealing
with.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
that
was
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
in
kiowa,
was
accepted
by
the
dissent
in
kiowa.
but
what
the
majority
said
is
really
congress
is
best
able
to
balance
the
rights,
remedies
and
reliance
interests
on
the
parties.
and
i'd
note,
picking
up
on
your
question
to
my
friend
earlier,
that
after
kiowa
congress
hasn't
been
silent.
congress
has
reaffirmed
tribal
immunity
in
the
patriot
act
extension
in
2005
and
the
sigr
act
of
2009.
they've
cut
it
back
in
the
arizona
water
act
and
the
zuni
acts
of
2003.
this
is
not
a
circumstance
in
which--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
think
that's--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--our
position
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--our
position,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
they
are
indian
lands
and
there
is
lots
of
different
remedies
available
both
on
and
off
indian
lands,
and
that
this
court
in
kiowa
set
out
a
way
to
deal
with
any
sort
of
cutting
back,
which
is
to
leave
it
to
congress.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
what
the
court
should
do
is
the
same
thing
it
did
in
kiowa,
which
is
bracket
that
question,
because
this
is
as
far
away
from
that
as
you
can
possibly
get.
here
the
state
entered
into
a
contract
with
its
eyes
open
that
not
just
it
didn't
say
anything
about
tribal
immunity,
it
reaffirmed
tribal
immunity,
at
petition
appendix
page
90.
now,
michigan
doesn't
like
the
terms
of
that
deal
and
so
they
are
coming
and
trying
to
renegotiate
that
now.
so
there
may
be
--
for
the
tort
plaintiff,
i
understand
there
may
be
any
number
of
arguments
available,
but
this
is
so
far
from
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
they
would.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i'm
not
sure
for
an
element
of
that
crime
whether
that
piece
of
it
would
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
would
be
an
attendant
circumstance
and
not
subject
to
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
but
there
is
still
civil
remedies
and
other
things
going.
