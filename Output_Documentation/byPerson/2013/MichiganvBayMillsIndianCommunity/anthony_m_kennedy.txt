justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
authority
--
what's
your
best
case
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that
states
have
a
lesser
burden
when
they're
faced
with
a
sovereign
immunity
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
--
that's
a
big
reading
assignment.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
couldn't
you
at
least
--
i
think
this
is
justice
alito's
question.
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt.
but
why
couldn't
you
say
that
it's
a
matter
of
compact
interpretation
whether
these
are
indian
lands?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
so
you
go
to
federal
court
to
interpret
the
contract.
there's
no
--
immunity
has
been
waived,
and
you
say
these
are
not
indian
lands.
i
think
that's
what
justice
alito
was
asking.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
him.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
compact
refers
to
indian
lands.
surely,
you
could
take
the
position
that
there
is
a
waiver
of
immunity
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
are
indian
lands
under
the
compact.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
statute
says
that
there
is
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
any
cause
of
action
initiated
by
a
state
or
indian
tribe
to
enjoin
gaming
activity
that
is
conducted
in
violation
of
the
compact.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
think
that
1166
abrogates
the
immunity,
which
provides
that
for
purposes
of
federal
law
all
state
laws
are
applicable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
this
casino
in
this
case
is
part
of
a
compact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
casino
in
this
case
in
your
view
is
not
subject
to
any
compact,
is
not
covered
by
any
compact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
tribe
takes
such
an
obscure
position,
such
a
changing
position,
as
to
whether
or
not
we
are
dealing
with
federal
lands
here,
or
pardon
me,
with
indian
land,
maybe
that's
a
reason
why
we
should
confine
and
limit
kiowa
so
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
indian
gaming
and
we
won't
have
this
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
wanted
to
get
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
is
it
your
position
that
these
are
indian
lands?
and
i
still
don't
understand
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that's
true,
then
maybe
this
whole
idea
of
immunity
doesn't
work
very
well
in
the
context
of
gaming.
