chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-515,
michigan
v.
bay
mills
indian
community.
mr.
bursch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
jurisdictional
objection
or
a
procedural
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
why
did
--
along
the
same
lines,
why
did
you
assert
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
when
the
tribe
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
concerning
the
status
of
those
lands?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
status
of
the
land
as
indian
lands
determined
by
the
compact?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
you
prosecute
people
who
frequent
this
illegal
casino?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
it.
you
don't
have
a
square
ruling,
so
i
want
to
make
clear,
because
both
you
and
the
solicitor
general
have
suggested
this
as
an
option.
you
think
it
is
all
right
for
the
state
to
go
in
and
arrest
every
employee,
management,
labor,
who
is
participating
in
this
casino
and
subject
them
to
criminal
sanctions,
civil
penalties
and
an
injunction.
you
have
got
no
problem
with
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
as
a
tribe,
you
as
a
tribe
would
have
no
objection
to
that
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
you
could
suggest
different
ways
and
the
state
could
tell
you,
you
know,
go
fly
a
kite,
we
are
prosecuting
these
people.
and
you'd
have
no
objection
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
ex
parte
young?
are
you
willing
to
waive
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity
in
an
ex
parte
young
action?
because
in
your
opposition
to
the
complaint
in
this
case
you
raised
sovereign
immunity
as
an
objection
to
the
ex
parte
young
count.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
just
are
available;
that
you
would
not
assert
sovereign
immunity
if
they
brought
an
ex
parte
young
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
an
arbitration
works.
the
federal
government
has
a
very
keen
interest
in
whether
this
is
indian
land
or
not.
and
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
decide
that
in
a
way
that's
going
to
bind
anybody?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
ongoing,
as
far
as
the
tribe
and
the
state
is
concerned,
they
proceed
from
then
on
as
if
this
is
indian
lands,
even
though
the
federal
government
is
saying,
no,
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
so
the
arbitration
doesn't
get
--
so
the
arbitration
doesn't
get
you
anywhere
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
we
get
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we've
talked
about
this
prosecuting
the
employees.
i
suppose
if
you
bring
a
criminal
action
against
one
of
the
employees,
the
state
would
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
this
was
not
indian
lands?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
much
of
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
makes
it
a
much
more
different
remedy
than
the
typical
injunction
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
not
yet.
we
are
going
to
hear
from
mr.
kneedler
first.
[laughter]
he
might
have
something
you
would
like
to
respond
to.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
are
quasi
sovereigns.
which
means--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--dependent
sovereigns
which
is
surprising
that
the
scope
of
their
immunity
exceeds
that
of
states
or
foreign
sovereigns.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
federal
government
can
certainly
take
enforcement
action
against
this
casino.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
federal
government,
the
solicitor
of
interior
has
said
these
are
not
indian
lands,
the
nigc
has
adopted
that
interpretation.
the
nigc
had
said,
but
we
can't
do
anything
because
they
are
not
indian
lands.
and
we
work
on
indian
lands.
and
then
they've
referred,
as
i
understand,
the
matter
to
the
united
states
attorney
who
has,
thus
far,
not
done
anything,
right?
so
basically
as
i
see
it,
the
federal
government
is
saying,
states,
you
can't
take
action
against
this
illegal
casino.
we're
the
only
ones
who
can.
we
agree
that
it's
illegal,
but
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
bursch,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
