justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
before
you
go
on,
could
you
address
the
jurisdiction
question
for
me?
i'm
not
sure
why
you're
here.
the
only
injunction
that
i
see
was
entered
on
behalf
of
little
--
little
traverse's
and
not
on
behalf
of
the
state.
and
so,
the
counts
that
you're
arguing
about
were
added
after
the
injunction
was
issued.
how
do
you
have
jurisdiction
to
act
--
to
argue
someone
else's
injunction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that,
in
fact,
is
not
what
the
district
court
said.
the
district
court
explicitly
said
in
its
order
granting
the
injunction
that
the
state
hadn't
filed
an
injunction,
hadn't
intervened
and
had
only
filed
supporting
papers
in
support
of
little
traverse's
case.
i'm
a
little
--
i'm
very,
very
confused
as
i
looked
at
what
the
district
court
said.
it
explicitly
said
you
weren't
part
of
the
order.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
“
consolidated
”
can
have
two
meanings
and
--
and
--
to
be
heard
together
or
to
be
joined
together.
i
don't
think
the
district
court
understood
that
this
was
going
to
be
joined
together.
why
did
it
say
what
it
did?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
didn't
you
file
an
injunction
--
why
does
your
brief
say
that
you
filed
it
only
in
support
of
little
traverse
and
not
on
your
own
behalf?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'll
ask
--
i'll
ask
your
opposition,
but
i
don't
see
why
the
district
court
would
have
made
the
point
it
did
if
it
believed
that
it
was
dealing
with
both
of
you
as
parties.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
we
have
to
--
we
have
to,
if
we're
not
sure,
raise
any
jurisdictional
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
wasn't
eminently
clear
to
the
district
court
who
entered
the
order.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
roads
lead
to
one
issue,
i
think.
if
you
had
gotten
a
declaratory
judgment,
they
would
have
had
to
stop
their
gaming
activity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
their
property;
isn't
that
what
this
suit
is
about,
you
trying
to
take
over
the
--
the
casino?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
not
ex
parte
young?
you
point
to
one
or
two
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
suggest
there
not
might
be
ex
parte
younger
jurisdiction,
but
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
so
why
not
go
after
just
the
officials?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
all
you
wanted
to
do
was
stop
them
from
doing
the
gaming
casino.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
have
gotten
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
what
--
what
would
happen
if
this
were
indian
lands,
and
they
went
ahead
and
did
exactly
what
they
did?
they
--
there
was
no
dispute
that
these
were
indian
lands.
would
you
have
had
grounds
to
object
to
them
building
a
casino
on
these
lands?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
would
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
the
issue
of
what
constitutes
indian
lands
is
between
the
federal
government
and
the
indians
pursuant
to
the
land
trust
settlement,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
know
you
do
and
i
know
why
you
do.
but
--
but
what
defines
the
lands
is
the
settlement
trust,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
put
--
put
this
aside
of
gambling.
let's
assume
that
it
was
just
their
buying
this
land.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
have
stopped
the
buying
of
this
land
or
unravelled
it?
didn't
we
have
a
recent
decision
that
said
no?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
wouldn't
you
have
had
to
follow
--
if
you
were
going
to
object
to
this
land
being
taken
into
the
land
trust,
wouldn't
you
have
had
to
follow
the
administrative
process?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
win
in
an
arbitration
when
the
gaming
commission
has
said
it's
not
indian
lands?
i
mean,
i
actually
am
not
sure
that
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
was
right
on
this,
okay?
but
putting
my
own
beliefs
or
questions
about
that
ruling,
how
do
you
win
as
the
federal
government
has
said
it's
not
indian
lands?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
how
does
the
arbitration
board
change
the
mind
of
the
gaming
commission?
aren't
they
the
final
deciders
of
whether
this
is
trust
land
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
so
we
understand--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
happens
if
you
can't
convince
the
federal
government
that
these
are
indian
lands,
and
despite
the
gaming
commission's
final
ruling,
there
is
no
other
way
to
overturn
it,
you
decide
to
operate
the
casino.
it's
not
indian
lands
by
the
federal
government.
you
haven't
convinced
them
otherwise.
what
occurs
at
that
moment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
can
stop
you
and
using
what
mechanisms?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
compact
only
comes
into
play
if
it's
indian
lands.
but
if
the
federal
government
has
said
it's
not
indian
lands,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
go
back
to
the
beginning
question.
you
have
remedies
you
don't
like,
but
the
waiver
under
igra
is
not
for
damages.
it's
only
for
injunctive
relief.
you
have
that
in
ex
parte
young.
why
are
you
asking
us
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
damages?
