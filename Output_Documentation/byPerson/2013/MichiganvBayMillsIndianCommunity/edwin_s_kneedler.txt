mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
respond
at
the
outset
to
the
suggestion
that
this
court
might
modify
the
categorical
rule
in
kiowa
that
an
indian
tribe
is
subject
to
suit
only
if
congress
unequivocally
consents
in
order
to
allow
suits
by
states.
first
of
all,
both
puyallup
and
pottawatomi
were
suits
by
states
for
prospective
injunctive
relief
and
the
court
found
them
barred.
puyallup
was
off
reservation.
but
there's
another
point
that
i
think
ties
in
with
the
questions
about
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
in
this
court's
decision
in
blatchford,
the
court
held
that
the
state
of
alaska
could
not
be
sued
by
an
indian
tribe
complaining
about
the
distribution
of
some
state
funds
in
alaska,
which
does
not
have
indian
country.
the
court
held
that
the
suit
was
barred.
in
doing
so,
the
court
recognized
that
the
eleventh
amendment
had
originally
been
understood
to
bar
suits
only
by
individuals.
but
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
principality
of
monaco,
the
court
said
that
the
11th
amendment
also
barred
suits
by
foreign
sovereigns.
and
the
court's
rationale
in
principality
of
monaco
was
that
foreign
sovereigns
were
not
parties
to
the
convention.
there
was
no
reciprocal
abrogation
of
immunity
between
foreign
sovereigns
and
states.
and,
in
fact,
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
that
the
state
of
mississippi
could
not
sue
monaco,
and
in
this
case
monaco
could
not
sue
mississippi.
the
court
applied
that
very
same
reasoning
in
blatchford
to
an
indian
tribe.
the
court
said:
we
have
held
in
the
past
that
indian
tribes
may
not
be
sued,
and
they
cited
puyallup,
which
was
a
suit
by
a
state,
and
the
court
said:
logically
it
follows
that
a
tribe
may
not
sue
a
state.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
state
where
that
gaming
occurs
can
be,
but
that's
because
of
nevada
vs.
hall
where
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
--
for
states.
in
the
states--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--california
in
the
state-to-state
situation,
it's
because
of
the
reciprocity.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
if
i
may
explain.
it's
important
to
understand
the
reasoning.
the
reasoning
why
a
suit
by
a
state
against
the
sovereign
would
now
be
okay
is
because
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
as
i
mentioned
with
the
principality
of
monaco,
what
the
court
said
there
is
the
state
could
not
sue
the
principality
of
monaco
because
at
the
time
there
was
no
abrogation
of
immunity.
foreign
sovereign
immunity--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
all
respect,
justice
scalia,
it
was
based
upon
the
executive
branch's
determination
in
the
tate
letter.
in
this
court's
decision
in
republic
of
mexico
vs.
hoffman.
the
court
said
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
deny
an
immunity
that
the
government
recognizes.
prior
to
1952,
when
the
united
states
adopted
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
foreign
sovereigns
were
absolutely
immune
from
suit,
unless
the
political
branches
said
otherwise.
in
the
tate
letter,
the
executive
branch
adopted
what
was
the
developing
body
of
international
law
for
foreign
sovereign
immunity
and
said
that
commercial
activities
could
be
the
subject
of
suit.
that
was
codified,
but
the
court
did
not
take
it
upon
itself
to
modify
that
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
this
is
the
point
that
the
court
made.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
but
it
didn't
treat
it
just
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
like
a
maritime
common
law
claim
or
something
like
that.
it
treated
it
as
structural
under
the
constitution.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
indian
tribes.
the
constitution
refers
to
indian
tribes
--
worcester
v.
georgia
announced
that
indian
tribes
are
sovereigns.
we
make
treaties
with
sovereigns.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
are
dependent
sovereigns,
but
they
are
dependent
upon
the
plenary
power
of
congress,
not
the
plenary
power
of
this
court.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
first
of
all,
by
--
the
casino
is
promptly
closed.
whether
it
would
have
been
a
prudent
exercise
of
federal
criminal
prosecutorial
authority
or
civil
action
under
1955,
is
committed
to
the
ordinary
prosecutorial
discretion
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
constitution.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
constitution--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--this
court.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
but--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
this
court
didn't
do
it
as
a
matter
of
common
law.
it
did
it
by
looking
at
the
constitution.
we
have
treaties
with
indian
tribes,
we
have
the--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
this
court
said,
it's
a
general
proposition
that
diminishment
of
tribal
sovereignty
is
for
the
political
branches.
the
court
said
that--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
against--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
congress
has
addressed
this
problem
in
numerous
ways.
for
example,
the
--
and
in
deciding
whether
to
abrogate
immunity,
they're
complex
decisions.
should
it
be
under
tribal
law?
should
it
be
under
state
law?
should
it
be
under
federal
law?
should
the
suit
be
if
federal
court?
should
it
be
in
state
court?
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
unless
--
unless
the
tribe
consents.
as
the
--
as
two
of
the
amicus
briefs
point
out,
a
number
of
the
tribal
compacts
provide
for
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
for
tort
claims
that
may
arise
out
of
--
out
of
the
gaming
operation.
contract
claims
could
be
--
could
be
brought
in
tribal
court.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
exactly.
and
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
court
said
in
kiowa,
in
addition
to
reaffirming
this
analysis
that
i
described
from
blatchford
and
coeur
d'alene
tribe
v.
idaho,
the
court
reaffirmed
that
reciprocity
and
principality
of
monaco
point.
but
it
also
pointed
out
the
tremendous
reliance
interests
that
have
grown
up
on
--
the
basis
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity.
it
pointed
out
that,
for
example,
450
n
of
title
25
which
specifically
preserves
immunity,
something
that
was
reiterated
in
the
no
child
left
behind
act.
but
it
also
specifically
pointed
out
that
congress
has
sometimes
created
narrow
exceptions
to
the
immunity.
and
critically,
one
of
the
ones
it
cited
was
the
very
one
on
which
michigan
is
relying
in
this
case,
2710(d)(7)(a)(ii).
that
is
a
limited
exception
for
injunctive
actions
by
a
state
against
a
tribe.
congress
addressed--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
may
well
not
make
sense
or
it
may
not
lend
itself
to
one
answer
for
the
reasons
that
i
said.
congress,
for
example,
when
it
comes
to
tort
claims
against
tribes,
adopted
a
provision
making
the
united
states
liable
for
tort
claims
and
not
--
and
not
others.
it
may
not
lend
itself
to
one
principal
answer,
which
is
why
the
court
said
in
kiowa
said
it's
up
to
the
legislature,
the
congress,
to
weigh
the
various
pros
and
cons
or
up
to
the
tribe
itself
in
deciding
whether
to
weigh
it.
