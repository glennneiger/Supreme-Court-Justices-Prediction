justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
could
you
explain
that?
because
i
thought
that
the
purpose
--
that
the
whole
point
of
the
c&l
enterprises
case
is
to
say
that
when
a
tribe
agrees
to
arbitration,
it
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
for
that
purpose
in
that
proceeding.
are
you
saying
that
there
was
something
special
in
this
agreement?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think
this
is
what
justice
kennedy
was
--
was
getting
at
when
he
asked
you
for
a
case,
because
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
when
the
state
is
the
plaintiff--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
tribe
disappears,
so--
justice
elena
kagan
--okay.
so
what
--
i
guess
what's
--
what's
--
what's
the
case
that
would
suggest
that
when
the
plaintiff
shifts
the
sovereign
immunity
is
--
goes
away?
justice
elena
kagan
general,
if
--
if
i
could
assume
that
this
is
not
indian
lands
and
just
ask
why
you
need
for
sovereign
immunity
to
go
away?
so
you
have
the
ability
to
arrest
people.
you
have
the
ability
to
bring
ex
parte
young
actions.
presumably,
you
have
the
ability
on
non-indian
lands
simply
to
shut
down
a
casino.
presumably,
you
have
the
ability
on
non-indian
lands
to
condition
any
licensing
of
the
casino
on
whatever
you
want.
i
guess
the
question
is:
on
non-indian
lands,
you
have
a
thousand
ways
to
stop
a
casino
that
you
don't
want.
why
do
you
need
the
abrogation
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
that
all
of
our
cases
suggest
that
sovereign
immunity
is
quite
important
to
a
sovereign's
dignity
and
that
it's
not
nothing
to
abrogate
sovereign
immunity.
and
so
you
can
say,
well,
you
know,
that
would
be
less
intrusive
than
all
these
other
things,
bringing
ex
parte
young
suits,
arresting
people,
just,
you
know,
conditioning
the
--
a
license,
stopping
the
casino
from
operating.
but,
you
know,
i
suspect
that
the
sovereign
tribe
here
would
say
that,
no,
it's
--
it's
an
affront
to
their
sovereignty
to
take
--
to
strip
them
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
--
and
none
of
these
other
options
that
you
have
are
that.
justice
elena
kagan
why
couldn't
this--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
katyal,
what
is
the
difference
--
the
state
can
really
--
it
can
shut
down
these
gambling
operations
easily
if
it's
off
indian
lands.
what
the
state
can't
do
is
get
any
kind
of
damages
or
money
remedies;
isn't
that
really
the
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
maybe
that's
an
important
difference.
i
mean,
maybe
we
should
give
the
state
the
ability
to
collect
damages.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
there
seems
something
sort
of
strange
about
that,
general,
because
as
i
read
kiowa,
what
it
was,
was
an
invitation
to
congress.
it
was
saying,
you
know,
we
have
some
concerns
about
this,
we're
not
sure
it
makes
sense.
we
are
dropping
a
very
broad
hint
that
congress
should
change
it.
and
15
years
later,
congress
has
done
nothing.
and
then
to
come
back
15
years
later
and
to
say,
you
know,
congress
didn't
really
accept
our
hint,
so
we'll
just
do
it
ourselves
and
make
congress
reverse
it,
wouldn't
you
think
that
that's
a
strange
procedure
to
use?
justice
elena
kagan
or
that
congress
thought
that
this
did
make
sense.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
would
have
thought,
general
bursch,
that
one
of
the
principles
behind
indian
law
in
this
country
goes
something
like
this:
congress
can
do
pretty
much
whatever
it
wants
with
respect
to
indian
tribes,
but
we
will
not
likely
assume
that
congress
means
to
undermine
tribal
sovereignty.
we
will
--
we
will
insist
that
congress
says
that
before
we
put
it
into
effect.
and
here,
it's
not
just
--
i
mean,
congress
has
given
every
indication
that
it
does
not
wish
to
change
this,
notwithstanding
our
hints
that
it
should.
