justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
is
the
--
why
is
that
important?
why
is
the
issue
that
you've
brought
before
us
important?
in
addition
to
the
possibility
of
an
ex
parte
young
action,
you
could
certainly
arrest
people
who
are
running
what
you
believe
is
an
illegal
casino
in
the
state,
can't
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
in
addition
to
that,
couldn't
you
have
stopped
this
before
it
even
started
by
insisting
in
the
compact
that
the
tribe
waive
sovereign
immunity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
going
forward
then--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
that's
a
more
sophisticated
version
of
my
question.
[laughter]
no.
seriously,
it
gets
into
a
more
--
more
difficult
issue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
going
forward,
is
this
of
any
importance?
why--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
seems
to
me
if
a
tribe
wants
to
open
a
casino
and
the
state
has
to
--
it
has
to
have
a
compact
with
the
state.
isn't
all
the
bargaining
power
on
the
--
on
the
side
of
the
state?
so
the
state
says,
fine,
if
you
want
to
do
that,
you
have
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
--
but
i
mean,
when
will
--
when
will
this
compact
expire?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
just
pursue
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
compact
has
expired
and
there's
--
so
then
how
can
they
operate
the
casino?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
until
they
reach
a
new
compact,
it
continues.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
mean,
is
--
is
it
not
correct
that
the
people
who
work
in
these
casinos
are
just
employees?
they
have
no
other
connection
with
the
tribe?
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
for
purposes
of
sovereign
immunity,
does
it
make
any
difference
that
you
have
at
least
a
colorable
claim
if
this
is
on
indian
lands?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
so
if
your
--
if
your
client
or
another
tribe
just
decided
to
go
into
the
gaming
business
all
over
the
country
and
began
opening
casinos
in
places
that
clearly
are
not
indian
lands,
you
still
would
have
sovereign
immunity.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
remedy--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
remedy
would
a
private
person
have?
suppose
a
patron
of
a
casino
was
beaten
up
by
casino
employees.
what
remedy
could
that
person
have?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
private
individuals
who
may
have
a
claim
against
--
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
the
casino?
vendors
who
want
to
be
paid,
somebody
who
slips
and
falls.
that's
all
barred
by
sovereign
immunity?
