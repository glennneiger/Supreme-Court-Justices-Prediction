mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
bay
mills'
concession
on
the
first
question
presented,
the
only
issue
is
whether
bay
mills
enjoys
blanket
immunity
from
suit
when
it
engages
in
illegal,
off-reservation,
commercial
conduct.
and
the
answer
is
no
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
it
makes
no
sense
that
congress
intended
states
to
have
a
federal
injunctive
remedy
for
illegal
gaming
on
reservation,
but
no
injunctive
remedy
if
that
gaming
takes
place
on
land
that
is
subject
to
the
state's
exclusive
jurisdiction.
second,
a
tribe
should
not
have
greater
immunity
than
foreign
nations.
there's
no
dispute
that
if
france
opened
up
an
illegal
business
in
michigan,
casino
or
otherwise,
it
would
have
no
blanket
immunity.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
not
quite
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
originally,
this
case
was
filed
as
two
separate
lawsuits.
michigan
was
a
plaintiff,
and
then
the
other
tribe
was
a
plaintiff
in
the
separate
case.
those
cases
were
consolidated
and
then
when
the
motion
for
injunction
was
filed,
michigan
joined
in
that
motion,
filed
a
brief
supporting
it
and
everyone
proceeded
under
the
assumption
that
both
the
tribe
and
the
state
were
asking
for
the
injunction.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
again,
they
were
consolidated
cases.
we
were
supporting
the
injunction--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
i
think
it
was
everybody's
understanding
that
these
were
joined
together
because
the
parties
were
pursuing
the
exact
same
issues.
and
so
then
once
this
went
up
to
the
sixth
circuit,
there
was
no
question
in
the
sixth
circuit's
mind--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--because
once
the
cases
were
consolidated,
and
at
that
point
we
were
even
using
the
same
docket
entries,
there
was
already
a
motion
on
file.
so
there
was
no
need
to
have
a
second
motion.
it
was
clear
to
everyone
that
the
state
of
michigan
and
the
tribe
were
both
pursuing
that
injunctive
relief
together.
and
that's
exactly
the
way
the
sixth
circuit
treated
it.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
everyone
has
proceeded
up
the
chain,
including
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
consolidated,
that
michigan
was
requesting
an
injunction
and,
in
fact,
that
kind
of
a
procedural
objection
has
never
been
raised
by
anybody,
certainly
not
at
the
petition
stage.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
sure.
but
i
think
it
was
eminently
clear
to
the
sixth
circuit,
if
you
read
its
opinion--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--your
honor,
it's
a
procedural
objection.
the
only
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there's
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
1331,
which
has
been
conceded
and
the
united
states
agrees
to
that.
and
so
i'm
not
going
to
spend
my
time
on
that.
where
i
would
like
to
spend
my
time
is
on
the
scope
of
tribal
immunity.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
there
were
two
reasons
for
that.
the
first
is
that
that
provision
was
only
discretionary,
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief.
but
even
more
important,
the
compact
also
makes
clear
that
the
tribe
did
not
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
for
purposes
of
arbitration.
so
if
we
had
gone
to
arbitration
and
prevailed,
if
the
arbitrator
had
reached
the
same
result
as
the
federal
government
did
as
to
the
status
of
these
lands
being
not
indian
lands,
then--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
am,
justice
kagan,
and
i'm
glad
you
brought
up
c&l,
because
there
you
had
a
construction
contract
where
there
was
invocation
of
an
arbitration
remedy
and
it
didn't
specifically
preserve
tribal
immunity.
here
we
have
the
exact
opposite.
in
the
same
paragraph
7
of
the
compact
where
we
have
the
arbitration
provision,
the
tribe
and
the
state
agree
that,
notwithstanding
the
arbitration
provision,
both
parties'
sovereign
immunity
is
not
waived
and
that
it's
--
it's
preserved.
so
if
we
took
a
successful
arbitration
judgment
and
then
tried
to
reduce
that
to
a
federal
judgment
in
court,
they
would
have
asserted
immunity
and
we
would
be
in
the
exact
same
procedural
posture
that
we
are
right
now,
talking
about
the
scope
of
tribal
immunity
involving
illegal
off-reservation
gaming.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because,
again,
it
wouldn't
have
done
any
good
for
us
to
stipulate
to
jurisdiction
on
the
tribe's
claim
about
the
status
of
the
lands,
because
simply
having
a
declaratory
judgment
wouldn't
have
given
us
any
relief.
we
would
have
had
to
file
a
counterclaim
for
injunctive
relief
and
the
tribe,
undoubtedly,
would
have
filed
or
i
would
have
asserted
a
tribal
immunity
there
as
well.
so
really,
all
roads
lead
to
tribal
immunity
no
matter
how--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--no.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
we
don't
want
to
take
over
the
casino.
we
want
to
stop
illegal
gaming
on
lands
subject
to
michigan's
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
two
responses
to
that,
justice
sotomayor,
one
kind
of
a
practical
consideration
and
then
one
a
broader
federalism
principle
that
i
--
that
i
want
to
emphasize.
the
narrow
practical
point
is
that
ex
parte
young
is
an
imperfect
remedy
for
lots
of
reasons,
as
we
express
in
the
brief.
it's
well
settled
that
you
can't
get
specific
performance
on
the
contract,
you
can't
enforce
a
state
law
in
federal
court,
you
can't
get
money
or
seize
assets
in
an
ex
parte
young
action.
and
that's
why
lower
courts--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
it's
not
clear--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--it's
not
clear
at
all
to
us
that
we
would
be
able
to
get
that
relief
based
on
the
lower
court
holdings.
now,
the
bigger
sovereignty
point
is
that
if
a
foreign
country,
if
france
or
haiti
came
in
and
opened
the
same
casino,
the
state
would
have
the
full
panoply
of
remedies
available
to
it.
and
it
should
have
those
remedies
because
any
additional
immunity
you
give
to
the
tribe
when
it's
engaging
in
illegal
conduct
on
lands
subject
to
michigan's
exclusive
jurisdiction,
you
are
necessarily
taking
away
from
the
sovereign
authority
of
the
state
of
michigan.
that's
a
lesser
remedy.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
here's
how,
justice
ginsburg.
because
kiowa
involved
a
private
party
plaintiff.
it
did
not
involve
a
sovereign
state.
and
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
states
are
different.
we
are
constitutional
sovereigns
and
so
we
aren't
treated
like
ordinary
business
plaintiffs.
in
that
case,
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
enforce
his
promissory
note
did
not
directly
implicate
a
state
police
power.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
for
the
proposition
that
states
are
different?
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
wouldn't
say
that
it's
a
lesser
burden,
but
i
think
you
need
to
analyze
this
as
a
zero
sum
gain.
that
when
you're
talking
about
activity
taking
place
on
sovereign
state
land
and
you're
not
allowing
the
state
to
have
its
whole
panoply
of
remedies,
that
you've
taken
away
an
attribute
of
sovereignty
that
--
that
would
have
existed.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
would
basically
just
cite
all
of
the
cases
this
court
has
decided
over
the
last
quarter
century
involving
the
ada,
the
adea
where
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
that
states
are
different.
sovereigns--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
and
justice
kennedy,
hopefully,
this
will
reduce
the
reading
assignment.
the
case
that
says
we
can
sue
france
is
alfred
dunhill,
which
was
this
court's
decision
that
first
recognized
the
commercial
distinction
for
foreign
nation
immunity.
now--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--that
was
common
law,
common
law
development
in
alfred
dunhill.
now,
shortly
after
that
congress
did
enact
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
which
essentially
codified
this
court's
common
law
rule
and
once
that
happens,
then
the
common
law
developed--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--so
california,
the
case
is
nevada
v.
hall
in
which
this
case
said
that
a
state's
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
does
not
extend
when
it's
got
actors
in
another
state.
there,
nevada's
agent
was
acting
in
california
and
the
court
held
that
that
actor
could
be
liable
for
suit
in
california.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
all
common
law.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
that's
the
thing.
kiowa
or
kiowa
did
not
involve
a
state
as
sovereign.
it
involved
a
private
business
plaintiff
and
it's
distinguishable
on
that
basis.
and
if
you
disagree
with
me
and
you
think
that
sovereign
states
should
be
treated
the
same
way
as
private
party
plaintiffs,
then
we
would
ask
you
to
overrule
that
part
of
kiowa
which
suggested
that
tribes
can
engage
in
illegal
commercial
conduct
on
land
subject
to
exclusive
state
jurisdiction
without
any--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
not
disappears.
but
it
--
it
disappears
when
they
move
off
reservation
and
they're
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
this
court's
case
that
would
suggest
that
is
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
because
that
was
a
case
where
a
state,
not
exercising
a
police
power,
but
one
of
its
lesser
powers,
the
power
of
taxation,
was
attempting
to
tax
cigarettes
that
were
being
sold
on
indian
trust
land
by
a
tribe.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
acknowledged
that
even
on
trust
lands,
so
this
isn't
on
land
that's
subject
to
state
exclusive
jurisdiction,
that
the
state
would
be
able
to
tax
those
cigarettes
being
sold
to
non-tribal
members.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
think
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
would
be
the
closest,
because
even
if
you
have
a
private
individual
who
was
trying
to
sue
a
tribe
for
conduct
that
was
taking
place
on
trust
land,
they
would
not
be
able
to
do
it.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
there
--
there's
lots
of
places
that
you
could
draw
the
line
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
here's
what
i'm
going
to
suggest.
nine
justices
in
kiowa,
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent,
recognized
that
there
were
substantial
issues
with
applying
tribal
immunity
on
or
off
reservation
in
the
commercial
context.
this
court
had
done
away
with
that
for
foreign
nations
in
alfred
dunhill.
it
decided
to
give
congress
one
more
chance
in
--
in
kiowa,
but
--
but
left
the
question
open
for
further
common
law
development.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
am.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
modify
it.
i
think
you
could
distinguish
it
based
on
the
fact
that
there's
a
private
party
plaintiff
there.
but
if
you
feel
otherwise
that
you
need
to
modify
it
in
order
to
rule
in
our
favor,
it's
--
it's
totally
within
your
power.
as
we
explained
at
length
in
the
context
of
foreign
nation
sovereign
immunity,
it's
a
body
of
common
law
that
this
court
is
free
to
modify
as
appropriate.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
there
are
--
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why
that
is
also
an
imperfect
remedy.
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
it
creates
exactly
the
kind
of
inter-sovereign
conflict
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
when
it
allowed
under
igra
for
states
to
get
injunctions
even
for
on-reservation
conduct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
that's
--
that's
a
great
question
and
the
answer
to
that
is
twofold.
first,
when
the
compact
was
negotiated
back
in
1993,
this
court
had
not
decided
kiowa.
that
came
five
years
later
in
1998.
and
so
congress
and
the
states
reasonably
assumed
at
that
time
that
if
a
tribe
was
engaged
in
illegal
commercial
conduct
off
reservation,
that,
of
course,
a
state
would
have
the
ability--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--a
matter
of
compact
interpretation
whether
these
are
indian
lands.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
--
i
didn't
get
quite
the
same
question
from
justice
alito.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
well,
if
i
can
finish
answering
justice
alito's
question.
you
asked
why
we
can't
just
go
in
and
arrest.
and
--
and
the
second
answer
to
that,
besides
the
--
the
conflict
of
going
in
with
armed
police
guards
and
arresting
tribal
officials
and
hauling
them
off
to
county
jail,
which
congress
tried
to
avoid
when
it
enacted
igra
in
the
first
place.
it's
what
everybody
wanted.
again,
it's
limiting
state
sovereignty--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--any
time
you
take
out
our--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--oh,
this
is
of
tremendous
importance.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
we
had
a
compact
in
place
in
1993
that
limited
their
casinos
so
that
this
wouldn't
happen.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
let
me
give
you
a
very
practical
answer
to
that
question.
this
compact
in
1993
had
a
20-year
term
on
it.
and
so
it
essentially
expired
at
the
end
of
--
of
november,
just
a
few
days
ago,
although
it
has
an
evergreen
clause
that
allows
it
to
continue
while
the
parties
try
to
negotiate
a
new
compact.
and
as
you
would
imagine,
the
very
first
thing
michigan
asked
for
in
its
proposed
amended
compact
was
to
waive
tribal
sovereign
immunity
to
deal
with
issues
like
this.
and,
unsurprisingly,
the
tribe
said:
we're
really
not
interested
in
that;
we
kind
of
like
the
way
the
sovereignty
issue
is
preserved
in
the
existing
compact.
now,
the
question
about
whether
this
has
an
impact
beyond
tribal
gaming,
the
answer
is--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--sure.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
it
hasn't
expired.
until
the
parties--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--until
they
reach
a
new
compact,
it
continues
in
effect.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
it's
not
determined
by
the
compact.
it
would
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
that's
the
federal
question
in
this
case.
and--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
don't
think
we
could,
respectfully,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
compact
does
not
envision
that
the
tribe
has
waived
immunity
for
any
purposes.
if
you
look
at
section
7
of
the
compact,
it's
--
it's
really
unequivocal
about
the
tribe
not
waiving
immunity.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
we
would
not.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
correct.
if
these
are
indian
lands,
then
it's
permissible
under
igra
and
under
the
compact
for
them
to
have
and
operate
a
casino.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
disagree
with
that
because--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--federal
court
interpretation
of
the
michigan
indian
land
claims
settlement
act,
yes,
would
determine
the
status
of
these
lands.
the
reason
why
it's
not
just
between
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government
is
because
michigan
has
a
huge
interest
in
having
lands
that
aren't
currently
under
its
exclusive
sovereign
jurisdiction
be
determined
to
be
indian
lands--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
if
you're
referring
to
the
--
the
patchak
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
in
that
case,
you
held
that
the
plaintiff
could,
quite
a
bit
after
the
fact,
file
a
lawsuit
to
unravel
that
transaction
if
the
lands
were
not
eligible
for
indian
gaming,
if
i'm
remembering
the
holding
correctly.
and
--
and
michigan
does
have
a
substantial
interest,
not
just
in
the
gaming
context.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
we
would,
but
the
land
has
never
been
taken
in
trust.
even
the
federal
government,
the
national
indian
gaming
commission,
has
concluded
that
these
are
not
indian
lands
for
purposes
of
the
settlement
act.
and
so
we
never
got
to
the
point
where
they
got
in
patchak,
where
they
went
through
the
administrative
process
to
take
the
lands
in
trust.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
we
tried
to
take
the
least
intrusive
means
necessary
to
stop
the
casino,
to
not
go
in
with
the
billy
clubs
and
the
guns
and
to
arrest
tribal
members,
but
to
ask
for
a
federal
civil
injunction.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
but,
again,
arresting
the
other
sovereign's
officers
is,
with
all
respect,
not
respectful
to
the
tribe,
which
is
why
that's
the
course
we've
pursued.
and
the
change
we're
asking
for
here
is
not
as
big
as
the
tribe
makes
it
seem,
because
in
igra,
section
2710,
we
have
the
ability
to
get
an
injunction
to
stop
illegal
gaming
taking
place
on
reservation.
and
so
it's
really
not
that
big
a
leap
to
say
if
they're
engaging
in
illegal
gaming
off
reservation,
likewise
there,
we
should
be
able
to
get
the
least
intrusive
remedy,
the
one
that
is
most
respectful
of
the
tribe's
sovereignty.
and
frankly,
we're
kind
of
surprised
that
the
united
states
would
take
the
position
that
we're
better
off
going
in
and
arresting
or
suing
individual
officers,
because
that's
not
the
way
sovereigns
are
supposed
to
interact.
and
it
would
be
a
big
deal
if
france
opened
up
a
casino
in
michigan
and
rather
than
seeking
a
civil
injunction,
we
tried
to
arrest
the
french
president
and
throw
them
in
a
michigan
county
jail.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
believe
some
of
the
employees
are
tribal
members,
some
are
not.
and
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
our
reply
brief
where
tribal
immunity
has
been
extended
to
tribal
employees
whether
they
are
members
of
the
tribe
or
not.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
michigan
citizens?
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes,
we
could
do
that.
but
again,
i
want
you
to
understand
the
scope
of
the
invasion
of
the
state's
sovereignty
here.
if
any
other
entity,
foreign
nation,
another
state,
an
individual,
set
up
an
illegal
business,
whether
it's
prostitution,
underage
drinking,
gaming,
you
name
it,
we
would
have
the
full
panoply
of
state
civil
and
criminal
regulatory
remedies
available
to
us
and
could
pick
the
most
appropriate
one.
and
somehow
because
this
is
a
tribe,
even
though
they
are
operating
on
michigan's
land
where
we
have
exclusive
regulatory
jurisdiction,
somehow
all
those
remedies
are
circumscribed
to
imperfect
remedies
like
ex
parte
young,
which
may
or
may
not
be
successful,
or
arresting
our
own
citizens,
and
that's
not
respecting
the
constitutional
sovereign
that
michigan
represents
in
this
case.
and
to
get
back
to
a
question
a
number
of
you
had
about
the
implications
of
this
aside
from
gaming,
this
happens
in
all
kinds
of
other
contexts
off
reservation.
you
just
had
a
case
in
2011
involving
the
oneida
tribe
in
new
york
where
they
failed
to
pay
their
property
taxes
in
new
york.
so
the
state
moved
in
to
foreclose
for
nonpayment
of
taxes
those
off-reservation
properties.
and
the
second
circuit,
interpreting
kiowa,
reluctantly
concluded
that
the
state
did
not
have
ability
to
enforce
by
foreclosing
on
that
property
because
the
tribe
had
immunity
and
invited
this
court
to
review
kiowa.
this
court
granted
cert.
eventually
cert
was
dismissed
because
the
tribe
waived
immunity
and
they
were
able
to
go
forward
and
pursue
that
remedy.
but
whether
it's
in
the
tax
context,
whether
it's
the
gaming
context,
whether
it's
the
criminal
context
--
you
know,
the
amici
briefs
of
oklahoma
and
alabama
are
replete
with
the
issues
that
they
are
having
as
sovereigns
in
running
up
against
the
tribal
sovereign
immunity
when
it
comes
to
these
contexts.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
clarify
just
two
things
about
court's
precedent
and
then
get
back
to
the
remedies
issue,
which
has
taken
up
so
much
of
our
time
this
morning.
first,
the
state
of
the
law
when
igra
was
adopted
in
1988;
again,
that
was
before
kiowa.
i
heard
my
friend
on
the
other
side
talk
about
puyallup
and
how
that
was
an
off-reservation
case.
and
what
you
need
to
understand
was
that
puyallup
was
the
third
in
a
series
of
three
opinions
that
this
court
issued.
and
it's
true
that
some
of
the
earlier
cases
involved
on
and
off-reservation
conduct.
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
--
this
is
at
pages
167
to
68
of
that
opinion
--
here
the
tribe's
contention
was
that
the
fishing
activities
on
its
reservation
were
immune.
and
justice
stevens
wrote
that
opinion,
and
then
only
a
few
short
years
later
in
kiowa
wrote
his
dissent
where
he
said
we've
never
before
drawn
that
on/off-reservation
distinction.
so
that's
what
puyallup
says.
with
respect
to
alfred
dunhill
and
the
evolution
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
as
a
common
law
doctrine,
four
justices
agreed
or
signed
on
to
the
entire
opinion
where
that
discussion
was
held.
one
justice
agreed
only
with
parts
one
and
two,
but
part
two,
on
page
694,
draws
the
commercial
line
and
says
the
problem
here
is
that
the
district
court
found
the
only
evidence
of
an
active
state,
as
opposed
to
a
commercial
act,
was
a
statement
by
counsel
that
the
cuban
government
and
the
intervenors
denied
liability
and
that's
not
enough.
and
--
and
the
court
did
reference
the
tate
letter,
but
that's
not
why
the
court
changed
the
common
law
of
foreign
nation
sovereign
immunity.
it
--
it
gave
respectful
consideration
to
the
executive
branch's
views,
and
then
it
reached
its
own
conclusion
about
what
the
common
law
should
say.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
you
are
exactly
right
to
say
if
it
makes
sense
in
the
foreign
nation
context
and
it
makes
sense
here,
apply
it
to
both.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no
question
they
could.
just
like
when
this
court
in
cabazon
said
that
states
didn't
have
the
regulatory
authority
they
thought
they
did
to
regulate
illegal
gaming
on
reservation,
and
this
court
said,
you
know,
states
can't
really
touch
that.
congress
immediately
jumped
in
and
corrected
course.
you
know,
conversely,
with
alfred
dunhill,
when
this
court
drew
the
line
at
commercial
conduct,
congress
immediately
jumped
in
and
it
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
that,
and
essentially
adopted
the
line--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--actually,
justice
kagan,
i
think
that's
the
way
that
the
common
law
works,
that
the
court
does
extend
invitations
to
the
legislative
and
executive
branches.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
you
could
draw
the
conclusion
either
way.
and
the
suggestion
by
the
tribe
and
the
government
that
somehow
this
court
lacks
the
power
to
define
common
law
tribal
immunity,
we
think,
doesn't
hold
water.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
respectfully
disagree.
and
the
best
evidence
of
that
congressional
intent
is
in
igra
itself
where
congress
abrogated
immunity
even
for
on-reservation
conduct.
think
about
what
an
extraordinary
remedy
that
is,
that
even
on
the
reservation,
a
state
would
have
the
ability
to
go
into
court
and
get
a
federal
injunction
rather
than
send
in
police
to
arrest--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right,
but--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
think
alfred
dunhill
makes
clear
that
this
court
can
change
the
stream
of
the
common
law
when
it
comes
to
--
to
immunity.
really
quickly
on
--
on
these
remedies.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'll
explain
why,
if
i
may
answer
the
question.
with
respect
to
arresting,
ex
parte
young
remedies,
enforcing
the
arbitration
and
having
them
waive
immunity,
all
these
things
are
unclear
whether
they're
available
to
us.
and
if
this
court
issued
a
definitive
opinion
that
said
we
have
each
one
of
those
remedies,
that
would
do
great
good
in
this
area.
but
the
reason
why
we
think
that
you
should
go
farther
than
that
is
because
if
sovereignty
means
anything,
it
means
allowing
people
to
define
what
is
illegal
on
their
own
lands,
whether
it's
prostitution,
gaming
or
underage
drinking,
and
being
able
to
use
the
full
enforcement
power
of
the
sovereign
state,
civil
and
criminal,
to
enforce
those
laws.
