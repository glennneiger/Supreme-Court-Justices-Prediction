mr.
steven
b.
loy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
standing
trust
for
antitrust
adopted
by
this
court
30
years
ago
in
agc
is
the
appropriate
test
to
give
effect
to
congress's
intent
under
the
lanham
act,
and
this
is
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
plain
text
of
the
lanham
act
at
section
45
states
that
the
intent
of
that
act
is
to
protect
commercial
actors
against
unfair
competition.
competition
generally
is
the
focus
of
both
antitrust
statutes
and
the
lanham
act,
and
any
test
that
this
court
adopts
should
be
tied
to
that
statutory
intent
section.
second,
the
history
in
the
common
law
of
both
antitrust
statutes
and
the
lanham
act
are
similar.
in
fact,
in
the
lanham
act
context,
the
common
law
was
more
specific
and
more
direct
than
it
was
under
the
antitrust
statutes.
and
finally,
each
of
the
five--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--the
lanham
act
provides
some
causes
of
action
that
are
beyond
the
common
law.
we
think
the
prudential
standing
considerations
that
were
in
place
at
common
law
or
at
least
should
guide
the
court
in
determining
what
congress
intended
to
do
by
it.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
i
think
there
are
two
components
to
the
common
law
and
--
and
we'll
--
and
i'll
talk
now
about
the
most
general
component,
and
that
are
considerations
of
proximate
cause
and
foreseeability
that
were
in
place
when
the
sherman
and
tate
acts
were
enacted.
those
are
general
propositions
that
apply
to
any,
at
least,
federal
statutory
cause
of
action
and
would
also
apply
then
to
the
lanham
act.
and
the
agc
factors
address
those
prudential
standing
requirements
about
specifically
asking
about
proximate
cause
factors.
the
very
first
question
that
agc
asks
is:
is
this
the
type
of
injury
congress
intended
to
address?
it's
a
logical
question
and
should
be
asked
appropriately
in
any
federal
statutory
cause
of
action.
the
second
factor--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--two
points.
first,
we
can
talk
about
the
--
the
alleged
false
advertisements
in
this
case.
the
first
alleged
false
advertisement
by
lexmark
was
to
lexmark's
customers
saying
that
you're
bound
by
this
or
use
restriction
on
our
cartridges.
that
advertisement
does
not
mention
static
control
at
all.
the
second
alleged
false--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--it
does
not
mention
static
control
at
all,
the
respondent.
the
second
alleged
misrepresentation
were
letters
written
to
remanufacturers
saying
to
the
remanufacturers,
if
you
remanufacture
--
remanufacture
our
cartridges,
you
will
violate
our
rights,
including
if
you
use
static
control's
products
to
do
it.
beyond
that,
though,
the
question
of
target
is
not
a
test.
it's
a
conclusion.
and
in
agc,
this
court,
in
the
antitrust
context,
rejected
a
test
for
antitrust
standing
called
the
target
area
test.
in
conte
brothers,
the
third
circuit
decision
that
first
adopted
the
agc
test
in
the
lanham
act
also
did
not
adopt
a
target
area
test.
and
so
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
factors
that
agc
lays
out
are
the
appropriate
factors
to
determine
antitrust
standing
in
any
given
case.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
and,
in
fact,
in
this
case,
they
did
have
standing.
and
one
of
the
remanufacturers
asserted
a
false
advertising
claim
against
lexmark
related
to
the
prebate
program.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
well,
we
think
it
is.
and
wherever
the
court
draws
the
line
on
standing,
whoever
is
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
is
always
going
to
think
that
it's
too
narrow.
our
cartridges,
for
instance,
they
do
have
microchips
on
them.
we
do
not
sell
the
microchips.
static
control
does
not
sell
cartridges.
those
cartridges
also
have
resin,
they
have
labels,
they
have
toner,
they
come
in
boxes.
if
we
allow
one
of
many
parts
suppliers,
like
static,
in
the
remanufacturing
industry
to
have
standing--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--certainly,
the
lanham
act
uses
the
any
person
language
and
that
language
is
no
different,
though,
than
the
any
person
language
appears
in
the
antitrust
statutes
and
in
rico,
both
instances
in
which
this
court
adopted
agc
tests
to
determine
standing.
the
one
difference
--
the
one
difference
is
the
lanham
act,
unlike
the
antitrust
statutes,
at
section
45
specifically
states
its
intent
as
to
protect
commercial
actors
against
unfair
competition.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
that
supplier
may
very
well
have
standing
to
bring
a
state
law
claim
for
defamation.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
we
believe
to
give
intent
to
section
45,
which
states
that
the
purpose
is
unfair
competition,
standing
under
the
lanham
act
is
going
to
be
a
narrow,
focused
inquiry.
if
you
--
using
the
cartridge
example
as
an
example,
if
a
supplier
of
microchips
who
is
one
of
many
suppliers
in
the
market
for
microchips
has
standing,
then
couldn't
the
person
who
prints
the
label
that
sells
to
remanufacturers
by
saying:
well,
if
lexmark
hadn't
made
these
statements
to
you,
you
would
have
refilled
more
cartridges
and
we
could
have
sold
more
labels.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
i
do.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
we
think
the
lanham
act
does
and
should
have
a
narrow
standing
requirement.
and
in
the
false
advertising
context,
it
would
be
unusual
--
conte
brothers
pointed
out
that
there
might
be
situations
where
a
noncompetitor
has
standing,
but
that
it's
going
to
be
an
unusual
situation.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
i
think
so.
i
think
under
--
under
any
standing
analysis
or
test,
one
of
the
questions
ought
to
be,
what
was
congress's
intent?
mr.
steven
b.
loy
that
should
always
be
a
question.
i
would
point
out
there
are
only
two
tests
that
have
been
identified
that
even
ask
that
question
in
the
lanham
act.
and
that
is
the
agc
test
that
we
propose
and
the
categorical
test
that
we
propose
in
the
alternative,
because
it
categorically
requires
direct
competition.
none
of
the
other
tests
that
have
been
identified
ask
that
question,
and
it
should
be
asked--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--i
think
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
holmes,
and
i
believe
it
was
the
concurrence
by
justice
scalia,
identified
the
proximate
cause
factors
as
part
of
any
standing
analysis.
and
i
think
that's
what
agc
was
getting
at
when
it
adopted
factors
2
through
5,
is
these
are
proximate
cause
type
injuries,
plus,
as
agc
noted,
we
want
to
make
it
judicially
manageable,
which
is
a
legitimate
prudential
standing
concern
because
one
of
the
prudential
background
considerations
is
whether
--
the
prohibition
on
litigating
generalized
grievances.
so
a
test
that
looks
at
those
proximate
cause
factors
which
are
part
of,
we
think,
a
standing
analysis
in
any
statutory
scheme,
is
appropriate
and
it
ensures
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
are
in
close
proximity
to
one
another.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
and
just
as
there
are
injunctive
remedies
available
in
the
antitrust
statute
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
cargill,
i
think
in
a
footnote
the
court
noted
that
if
all
you
have
is
an
injunctive
request
under
antitrust
statutes,
some
of
those
factors
may
not
be
relevant.
for
instance,
duplicative
damages,
risk
of
apportionment
issues
would
not
--
your
honor
is
correct--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--no.
what
we
were
saying
is
some
of
the
factors
that
agc
identifies
such
as--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--no.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
i
think
it
is
likely
still
appropriate
in
an
injunctive
analysis
to
look
at
the
proximity
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
inquiry.
i
think
some
of
the
damage
factors
for
agc
are
not
going
to
be
applicable
in
the
injunctive
analysis,
and
that's
what
we
do
in
antitrust.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
again,
there
very
well
could
be
state
law
remedies
available
to
plaintiffs
who
do
not
have
standing
under
the
lanham
act.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
we--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--we
agree
they
make
that
article
iii
allegation.
but
in
the
lanham
act,
where
we
think
it's
--
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
under
the
lanham
act
is
there
is
prudential
standing
consideration,
and
congress
has
not
expressly
negated
those.
so
the
question
is
what
test
to
apply.
we
think
the
lanham
act
is
a
limited,
focused
statutory
remedy.
it's
not
a
federal
tort
of
misrepresentation.
it's
not
a
federal
tort
of
deceit.
the
purpose
of
this
--
of
the
statute
expressly
is
to
protect
commercial
actors
against
unfair
competition,
not
against
unfair
trade
practices.
and
so
to
--
to
use
the
--
or
take
advantage
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
lanham
act,
which
has
potential
for
treble
damages
and
attorneys
fees,
we
think
it's
a
narrow
class
of
plaintiffs.
particularly,
unlike
the
antitrust
context,
there's
no
intent
requirement
under
the
lanham
act.
one
could
be
liable
for
damages
under
the
lanham
act
for
an
innocent
misrepresentation,
one
that
they
thought
at
the
time
was
truthful,
which
would
argue,
perhaps,
for
more
limited
standing
than
either
--
than
even
the
antitrust
statutes
because
there
is
an
intent
element
under
the
antitrust
statutes.
and
so
the
standing
should
be
more
limited
in
this
situation.
again,
it's
a
--
it's
a
narrow,
focused
statutory
remedy.
and
unlike
rico,
unlike
sherman,
unlike
clayton,
there's
an
intent
section
which
we
think
guides
the
courts
or
should
guide
the
courts
on
which
test
to
adopt.
and,
again,
the
only
two--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--well,
again,
on
the
alleged
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--we
would
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
--
of
their
counterclaim.
again,
their
--
the
advertisements
here
were
directed
to
the
remanufacturers
who
are
indirect
competitors
of
lexmark
and
was
telling
them--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--what
it
first
says
to
the
remanufacturers
is
that
if
you
remanufacture
our
cartridge
--
our
prebate
cartridge
generally,
you
infringe
our
rights.
but
you
will
also
infringe
those
rights
if
you
use
static
control's
products
to
do
it.
but
merely
because
one
is
a
target,
we
do
not
believe
it
necessarily
translates
into
standing.
it
did
not
translate
into
standing
in
the
agc
case;
the
union
was
the
target
and
this
court
nevertheless
denied
standing.
the
fifth
circuit
decision,
the
procter
&
gamble
decision
which
involved
procter
&
gamble
and
amway;
there,
the
parties
were
actually
competitors.
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
statements
that
--
that
procter
&
gamble
allegedly
made
about
compensation
to
amway's
distributors
and
how
they
get
distributors,
there
they
were
actually
direct
competitors
and
standing
was
not
provided,
which,
again,
we
think
just
reinforces
that
this
is
a
narrow
statutory
remedy.
the
--
the
--
couple
points
about
the
zone
of
interest
test
which
was
advocated
by
static
in
their
brief,
that
is
certainly
a
general
prudential
background
consideration.
we
think
it
would
apply
along
with
prohibition
on
--
on
generalized
grievances
and
asserting
rights
of
third
parties.
but
here
it
merely
asked
the
question.
we
think
agc
provides
the
answer
to
that
question.
and
the
zone
of
interest
has
been
largely
used
in
the
apa
context,
and
it's
--
it's
appropriate
in
--
in
that
context.
there's
a
two-step
inquiry
under
the
apa.
first,
the
apa
itself
is
a
procedural
act,
but
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
underlying
substantive
statute
to
determine
who
a
party
is
--
what
party
is
agreeing.
the
zone
of
interest,
therefore,
has
to
administer
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
very
different
federal
substantive
statutes,
and
so
some
flexibility
needs
to
be
inherent
in
--
in
that
test.
if
such
a
test
were
employed
we
think
in
the
lanham
act,
we
could
lead
to
overenforcement,
which
has
its
own
set
of
harms.
we
don't
think
you
want
to
deter
companies
from
putting
even
truthful
information
into
the
marketplace
for
fear
of
facing
lawsuits
by
remote
parts
suppliers.
and
--
and
so
in
this
instance,
we
think
the
agc
test
itself
provides
the
answer
to
the
question
of
what
is
in
--
in
the
zone
of
interest.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
we
think
it
suffers
from,
in
this
instance,
because
here
we
have
--
we
have
the
lanham
act.
we
can
tailor
a
--
a
standing
test
to
the
lanham
act.
the
reasonable
interest
suffers,
we
think,
from
the
same
flaws
in
this
context
as
would
the
zone
of
interest
test.
it's
no
more
than
article
iii
standing.
anybody
that
can
plead
a
reasonable
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
--
of
the
advertisement
and
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
interest
is
harmed,
then
that's
no
more
than
article
iii
standing
requirement.
and
we
do
in
this
case
believe
there
is
universal
recognition
that
there
should
be
prudential
standing
requirements
in
the
lanham
act
and
provides
little
guidance
to
courts
below
and
therefore
could
lead
to
inconsistent
results.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
we
think
in
any
federal
statutory
cause
of
action,
prudential
standing
requirements
are
presumed.
given
section
45
here,
we
believe
that
the
lanham
act
clearly
does
have
prudential
standing
requirements.
this
court
in
bennett,
in
looking
at
the
endangered
species
act,
at
least
the
standalone
citizenry
portion
of
it,
i
believe
determined
that
congress
eschewed
prudential
standing
requirements
there,
because
the
--
the
subject
matter
of
the
act
was
the
environment,
something
that
i
think
the
court
noted
everybody
has
an
interest
in
and
--
and
want
to
encourage
private
attorney
generals
to
pursue
those
causes
of
action.
and
in
that
situation,
there
was
a
right
of
first
refusal
for
the
government
to
first
bring
a
lawsuit
before
a
private
suit
could
be
brought.
so
there
are
times
when
prudential
standing
requirements
have
been
done
away
with
by
congress.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
i
think
--
i
think
the
--
the
first
place
you
look
is
at
the
text
of
the
statute
itself.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
situations
where
legislative
history
might
speak
to
intent,
and
i
think
clarke
says
let's
look
at
that,
in
this
situation,
the
1946
act
and
the
senate
report
that
accompanied
it,
said
this
is
the
purpose
to
--
this
is
the
end
to
which
this
statute
was
directed
and
it
identified
fair
competition
and
the
prevention
of
diversion
of
goodwill
from
one
to
the
other.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
that's
correct.
‶
any
person
″
language
here
would
allow
consumer
standing,
which
is
one
thing
that
every
circuit
that'
addressed
this
issue
has
agreed
upon,
that
there
is
no
consumer
standing
under
the
lanham
act.
again,
that's
tied
to
section
45,
which
protects
commercial
actors--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--i
think
standing
is
in
many,
if
not
most
instances,
a
separate
analysis
from
the
cause
of
action
itself.
and
the
text
is
always
going
to
provide
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
it
can,
and--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--it's
--
at
least
i
normally
don't
think
of
it
in
terms
of
jurisdictional.
i
think
article
iii
injury,
in
fact,
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
jurisdictional
analysis.
i
think
prudential
standing
is
a
little
bit
different.
that
phrase
only
came
into
use
i
think
in
the
'70s,
but
the
concepts
underlying
that
have
been--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--and
i
think
the
phrase
‶
statutory
standing
″
would
be
fine
with
us.
and
again,
the
very
first
agc
question
that
asked
that
question,
what
did
congress
intend
to
address
here?
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
i
have
three
short
points.
the
straightforward
question
for
this
court
is
what
test
to
apply
for
lanham
act.
and
we
believe
agc
is
that
test.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
in
analyzing
these
facts
got
it
correct
when
it
found
that
static
did
not
have
standing
under
that
test
and
when
it
found
that
static
was
not
a
target,
like
the
sixth
circuit
actually
found
that
static
was
not
a
target.
the
second
point.
through
the
entire
briefing
and
at
now
oral
argument,
i
--
i
still
have
not
heard,
we
have
not
heard
how
static
control
is
conceptually
any
different
than
the
union
was
in
agc.
and
that
just
goes
to
show
that
target
is
not
always
the
inquiry.
third
point.
if
this
court--
mr.
steven
b.
loy
--i'm
sorry.
what
i
intended
to
say,
and
if
i
misspoke,
i
apologize,
the
district
court
found
that
the
scc
lacked
standing.
the
district
court
found
that
scc
was
not
a
target,
although
the
sixth
circuit
decided
that
a
different
test
should
be
used.
the
sixth
circuit
also
found
that
static
control
was
not
a
target.
my
final
point
is
if
this
court
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
the
--
static
control's
counterclaim
never
alleges
target.
and
it
alleges,
in
fact,
that
the
remanufacturers
were
the
ones
whose
activities
we
were
trying
to
--
to
direct.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
a
zone
of
interest
test,
it
would
be
the
first
time
this
court
has
adopted
that
test
outside
the
apa
or
apa-like
context.
mr.
steven
b.
loy
if
title
--
no,
it
was
not
an
apa,
but
the
language
for
standing
that
the
court
analyzed
is
party
affected
or
aggrieved.
the
court
then
looked
at
the
similarity
of
that
language
to
the
language
in
apa
and
there
--
thereby
justified
using
that
test
in
that
case
with
similar
statutory
language.
i
think
opposing
counsel
said
they
--
that
under
their
zone
of
interest
test,
any
person
whose
products
or
services
are
expressly
or
implicitly
implicated
should
have
standing
under
the
lanham
act.
we
think
that
goes
too
far.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
