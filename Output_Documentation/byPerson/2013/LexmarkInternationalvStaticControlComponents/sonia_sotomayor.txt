justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
why
the
answer
to
that
question
doesn't
end
this
case
here?
you're
disparaging
the
goods
of
a
person.
you're
saying
that
it's
illegal
to
use
that
person's
products.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
essence
of
the
lanham
act
as
it's
now
written.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
there
are
two
remedies
under
this
statute,
injunctive
relief
and
damages.
and
to
the
extent
that
proximate
cause
always
limits
the
recovery
on
damages,
it
doesn't
limit
injunctive
relief
issues.
and
so
the
question
is,
why
should
we
be
reading
into
a
statute
a
limitation
against
bringing
any
action
based
on
your
proximate
cause
point
when
there
are
other
remedies
in
this
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
wrong
with
the
tests
adopted
by
three
circuits,
the
reasonable
interest
test?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
see
as
the
difference
between
reasonable
interest
and
zone
of
interest?
what
do
you
--
i
haven't
quite
understood
what
the
difference
is
between
the
two.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
how
that
would
affect
a
situation
that
i
read
about
in
the
papers
where
a
company
like
--
not
to
suggest
that
they
have,
but
only
using
this
as
a
hypothetical
example
--
mcdonald's
says
in
its
advertising:
we
in
fact,
our
calorie
count
is
less
than
200,
so
buy
from
us.
consumers,
under
your
theory,
can't
sue
under
the
lanham
act.
assume
that's
absolutely
false.
who
would
be
--
who
would
have
a
permissible
ground
to
sue
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
fitting
that
into
your
definition
of
what
‶
standing
″
is,
how
do
we
not
get
it
to
be
the
local
--
or
maybe
you
say
it's
okay
--
the
local
restaurant
that
has
no
franchises,
that
does
healthy
meals,
which
is
actually
true
of
many
restaurants
today,
particularly
in
washington?
