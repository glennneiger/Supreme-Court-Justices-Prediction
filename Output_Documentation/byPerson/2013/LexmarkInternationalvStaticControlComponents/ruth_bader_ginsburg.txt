justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
you
could
--
you
could
sue
them
for
infringing
on
your
patent
or
whatever
intellectual
property
protection
you
have.
but
here
is
an
entrepreneur
that
says,
we
make
a
product
and
lexmark
is
disparaging
our
product.
it
is
essentially
trying
to
get
us
out
of
this
line
of
business.
certainly,
if
you
just
read
the
words
of
the
lanham
act,
this
is
allegedly
false
advertising,
and
the
false
advertiser
shall
be
liable
to
any
person
who
believes
he
or
she
is
likely
to
be
damaged
by
such
an
act.
that
legislation
seems
to
envision
a
very
broad
standing,
certainly
enough
to
encompass
the
person
who
is
--
whose
product
is
being
disparaged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
to
me
why
--
we
are
talking
in
abstract
terms.
here
is
a
manufacturer
that
says:
my
product
is
being
disparaged
by
the
defendant.
my
product,
not
someone
else's.
the
result
is
that
i
am
losing
business.
why
do
we
need
anything
more
than
that
under
the
lanham
act,
which
makes
false
advertising
--
gives
a
claim
for
false
advertising
to
somebody
who's
been
hurt
by
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
not
asking
about
state
law
remedies.
i'm
looking
at
this
statute,
and
your
interpretation
seems
to
stray
very
far
from
what
the
statute
--
this
section
of
the
statute
says.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
you
just
read
this
section,
would
you
agree
that
--
what
is
the
party
--
scc
is
someone
who
has
been
injured,
damaged,
by
the
false
advertising?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
question
here
that
there
was
an
intent
on
the
part
of
lexmark
to
stop
the
static
control
company
from
making
these
microchips?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
that's
what
we
have
--
and
we
have
to
deal
with
the
complaint
and
we
have
to
assume
that
that's
true.
what
the
complaint
alleges
is
that
static
was
making
a
product
and
lexmark
was
disparaging
it,
and
not
by
happenstance,
but
quite
deliberately.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
--
the
directive,
the
letter
said
don't
buy
static
control's
product
because
if
you
do,
you're
in
jeopardy
of
being
a
contributory
infringer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
that
been
applied
outside
the
context
of
the
apa,
that
is
when
the
suit
is
against
an
agency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
been
applied
to
private
party
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
makes
this
limit
a
prudential
limit?
you
are
supposed
to
put
--
the
notion
of
a
prudential
limit
is
there
is
article
iii
standing,
but
even
so
you
can't
sue
because
you
don't
meet
the
prudential.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
zone
of
interests--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
zone
of
interest,
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
would
establish
another
tier
of
zone
of
interest.
the
--
arguably
within
the
zone
is
the
apa
standard.
and
you
said
here
you
could
strike
‶
arguably
″
and
just
have
it
within
the
zone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what's
wrong
with
the
--
what
is
it
--
agc,
the
antitrust
standard?
so
it's
got
five
things.
and
justice
alito
just
suggested
that
maybe
that's
more
generous
to
finding
standing
than
--
than
the
reasonable
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
you
used
target
twice.
once
you
said
scc
was
not
a
target
and
the
another
time
you
said
it
was,
but
it
--
target
isn't
a
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
that.
because
if
we
accept
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
as
true,
the
allegation
is
that
static's
product
was
disparaged.
that
remanufacturers
were
told
don't
use
this
product
because
if
you
do,
you're
going
to
be
involved
in
infringement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
was
title
vii
an
apa
--
when
i
asked
mr.
jones?
