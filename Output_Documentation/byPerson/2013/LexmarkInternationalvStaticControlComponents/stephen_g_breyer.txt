justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
have
the
--
shouldn't
a
supplier
have
standing
to
sue
the
competitor
of
the
firm
to
which
he
supplies
the
where
the
alleged
liable
or
slander
or
whatever
it
is,
is
directly
about
what
the
supplier
supplies.
the
example
may
be
clearer.
suppose
that
bailey's
sells
ice
cream
sundaes,
and
the
defendant
has
said
the
chocolate
sauce
in
bailey's
ice
cream
sundaes
is
poisonous.
now,
the
chocolate
sauce
does
not
compete
with
the
defendant
because
he's
an
ice
cream
parlor,
but
nonetheless
he
is
directly
affected
by
the
statement
that
he
is
suing
about.
he
is,
therefore,
different
from
the
other
suppliers
who
might
have
supplied
bailey's
with
cushions,
heat,
electricity.
but
shouldn't
at
least
that
supplier
of
chocolate
sauce
have
the
standing
to
bring
the
claim
against
the
ice
cream
parlor
that
competes
with
bailey?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not,
why
not
--
why
not
in
this
lanham
act
suit,
why
shouldn't
the
chocolate
sauce
supplier
have
standing?
he
is
directly
victimized
by
--
he
has
not
just
lost
sales
but
the
comment
is
about
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
answer
to
your
question,
if
you're
asking,
is
no,
because
the
person
who
supplies
labels
is
totally
--
the
statement
that
is
sued
about
has
nothing
to
do
with
labels.
so
the
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
statement
wouldn't
have
standing.
but
my
--
you
remember
my
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
why
shouldn't
that
person
who
is
talked
about
in
the
statement
have
standing?
a
clear
distinction.
not
every
supplier
could
sue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
tie
that
in?
i'm
sort
of
sorry
i
used
that
hypothetical.
[laughter]
but
it
nonetheless
illustrates--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it
illustrates
the
point.
i
mean,
in
my
own
mind,
the
standing
question
is
designed
to
answer,
are
you
the
kind
of
plaintiff
that
congress
intended
in
this
statute
to
protect
against
the
kind
of
injury
that
you
say
you
suffered?
now,
that
goes
back
to
justice
brandeis
and
it
goes
back
to
saying,
did
you
suffer
a
common
law
injury
or
do
you
fall
within
the
scope
as
defined?
normally
congress
doesn't
think
about
that
and
so
courts
decide,
and
we're
right
in
the
middle
of
that
decision.
so
if
i
think
that
basically
you
have
a
point,
that
at
least
the
supplier
who
is
mentioned
in
the
defamatory
statement
by
the
competitor
who
bought
the
supplies,
at
least
where
he
is
mentioned
explicitly,
there
should
be
standing,
which
means
your
side
would
win,
i
guess.
what
do
i
write
to
tie
that
in
to
the
three
separate
kinds
of
tests
that
the
circuits
have
talked
about?
that's
what
i
can't
quite
see,
because
they
talk
about
the
reasonable
interest
test,
they
talk
about
the
zone
of
interest
test,
they
talk
about
some
other
kind
of
test.
how
do
i
tie
this
into
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so
--
if
you
go
back
and
you
just
lift
the
apa
test
--
because
i
believe
justice
ginsburg
is
absolutely
right,
that
this
is
not
an
apa
suit
--
the
word
‶
arguably
″
was
inserted
in
the
normal
standing
test
by
adapso,
which
justice
douglas
wrote.
now,
if
we
take
that
and
simply
lift
it,
the
first
thing,
the
person
who
would
get
a
new
lawsuit,
i
guess,
is
a
consumer,
because
the
consumer
could
easily
say:
i
didn't
buy
this
product
because
of
the
false
statement
that
the
competitor
of
the
person
i
would
have
bought
from
made.
and
indeed
you
could
have
very
big
consumers
and
they
could
allege
all
kinds
of
injuries.
so
if
i
simply
lift
the
test,
i
rather
worry
that
i
am
changing
the
law
quite
radically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
‶
arguably
″.
isn't
it
arguably
in
part
to
protect
consumers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
does
that
--
just
thinking
of
justice
sotomayor's
hypothetical,
that
suggests
that
maybe
the
reasonable
interest
test
is
okay,
because
what
that's
trying
to
do
is
--
you
have
mcdonald's
that's
allegedly
made
the
false
statement,
and
then
there
are
a
range
of
people
in
terms
more
or
less
distant
in
respect
to
being
direct
competitors.
there
is,
what
you
said,
burger
king,
direct
competitor.
then
there
are
the
health
restaurants.
then
there
are
--
so
you
need
something
to
cut
off
at
some
point
the
plaintiff,
who
claims
to
be
a
direct
competitor,
but
really
he's
not
going
to
lose
much
money
and
he's
quite
distant.
a
health
restaurant
in
a
foreign
city,
you
know,
you
see?
and
the
reasonable
interest
test
i
think
is
trying
both
to
get
at
that
and
also
to
figure
out
what
kind
of
supplier
you
are.
are
you
one
who
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
false
statement
or
the
--
or
are
you
not?
you
don't
want
the
electricity
company
to
be
able
to
sue.
so
what
do
you
think
about
using
the
reasonable
interest
test,
but
explaining
it
in
something
like
the
terms
i've
just
stated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it's
who's
affected,
who
specifically
are
we
leaving
out?
look,
you
put
in,
i
don't
want
to
leave
out
--
you've
read
all
the
cases.
i
haven't
read
them
all.
but
i
see
that
you
put
in
--
we
put
in
the
direct
competitors.
they
fall
within
it.
we
put
in
certain
suppliers,
those
who
are
disparaged.
we
don't
want
the
electricity
company
to
be
able
to
sue,
according
to
you
and
the
cases,
and
i
guess
we
have
the
mirror
case
which
we'd
put
in
would
be
certain
buyers
like
retailers
or
wholesalers
and
probably
applying
the
same
rule
about
their
being
mentioned
in
the
--
in
the
false
advertising
or
in
the
statement.
who
have
we
left
out?
who
has
been
given
standing
in
some
of
these
cases
that
is
left
out
of
the
description
i
just
gave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
who
do
you
--
who
do
you
--
well,
who
--
who
has
not
been
left
out
who
should
have
been
left
out?
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
see
--
i'm
trying
to
see
am
i
forgetting
someone
that
--
that
your
reading
of
the
cases
suggests
has
been
given
standing.
