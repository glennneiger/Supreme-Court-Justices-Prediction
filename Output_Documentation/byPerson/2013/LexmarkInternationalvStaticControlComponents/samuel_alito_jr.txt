justice
samuel
a.
alito,

i
--
i
assume
you
would
agree
that
the
manufacturer
of
the
cartridges
that
compete
with
lexmark
would
have
standing
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
it's
not
a
very
big
step
from
the
manufacturer
of
the
cartridge
that
competes
to
the
manufacturer
of
the
chip,
which
is
really
the
essential
component
of
--
or
an
essential
component
of
the
cartridge
that
competes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
maybe
the
answer
is
when
we
just
can't
believe
that
congress
really
meant
the
literal
words
of
the
statute
to
be
interpreted
without
some
limiting
principle.
so
here,
congress
says
‶
any
person
″
and
any
person
surely
includes
people
who
purchase
printer
cartridges.
so
if
we
don't
think
that
--
that
congress
really
meant
for
every
single
person
who
purchases
a
printer
cartridge
to
be
able
to
file
a
claim
in
federal
court
with
no
amount
in
controversy
requirement,
then
that
would
be
a
situation
where
some
consideration
of
prudential
standing
would
have
to
take
place.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
comments
in
this
case
only
disparaged
the
cartridges
themselves
and
not
the
chips.
then
would
the
chip
manufacturer,
would
your
client
have
standing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
from
the
zone
of
interest
to
the
limiting
principle
that
you
are
suggesting,
which
is
that
the
zone
of
interest
includes
only
those
businesses,
other
than
the
direct
competitor,
whose
products
are
targeted
by
the
false
statements.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
well,
to
change
it,
suppose
the
statements
don't
implicitly,
even
implicitly,
target
static
control,
but
the
effect
of
the
statements
is
to
drive
static
control
out
of
business.
you
would
say
there
would
be
no
standing
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
so
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
about
the
soda
fountain
that
sells
ice
cream
with
chocolate
sauce
and
there
is
a
statement
that
the
chocolate
sauce
is
poisonous,
if
the
effect
of
that
is
to
drive
out
of
business
a
little
company
that
manufactures
ice
cream
that's
used
there,
that
company
would
not
have
standing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
bailey's
was
the
only
place
that
sold
this
chocolate
sauce,
bailey's
might
have
standing.
that
would
be
similar
to
this
case.
but
if
other
places
also
sold
this
chocolate
sauce,
then
bailey's
is
out.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
that
lexmark
had
not
made
disparaging
comments
about
static
control,
but
had
simply
made
false
statements
about
its
own
product.
suppose
it
said
that
if
you
use
our
products,
our
cartridges,
they
will
emit
some
sort
of
vapor
in
your
house
that
will
promote
good
health.
who
would
be
within
the
zone
of
interests
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
would
be
within
the
zone
of
interest?
only
--
would
other
printer
cartridge
manufacturers
be
within
the
zone
of
interest
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it's
not
a
reasonable
interest
test
then.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
am
i
correct
to
think
that
your
rule
is
that
the
only
people
who
have
standing
under
the
lanham
act
are
competitors
and
people
whose
products
are
disparaged?
and
if
that
is
true,
then
are
you
not
arguably
advocating
the
most
restrictive
test
for
lanham
act
standing
other
than
the
categorical
rule?
