the
lanham
act
goes
well
beyond
the
common
law,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
that
would
be
a
lot
stronger
if
--
if
you
said
the
lanham
act
merely,
as
the
sherman
act
was
supposed
to
have
done,
merely
adopted
the
common
law.
the
lanham
act
doesn't
merely
adopt
the
common
law.
it
goes
well
beyond
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mention
what
at
all?
it
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
proximate
cause?
what
about
proximate
cause?
do
you
agree
that
there's
no
proximate
cause
analysis
when
what
is
at
issue
is
an
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
answer
my
question.
yes
or
no?
do
you
agree
with
what
justice
sotomayor
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
prudential
standing?
i
don't
really
understand.
is
--
is
it
anything
other
than
--
should
it
be
re
--
renamed
statutory
standing?
it
can
always
be
done
away
with
by
congress,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
is
it
the
kind
of
standing
that
we
would
have
to
raise
on
our
own?
is
it
jurisdictional
so
that
if
--
if
a
party
hasn't
raised
it
below,
it
nonetheless
is
still
unavailable
argument
on
appeal?
is
prudential
standing
of
that
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
uncomfortable
with
the
notion
that,
you
know,
in
my
prudence
i
give
standing
here
and
i
deny
standing
there,
it's
up
to
me.
i
can
understand
article
iii,
but
unless
prudential
standing
means
statutory
standing,
so
that
i
look
to
the
statute
to
see
whom
it
was
intended
to
empower
to
bring
lawsuits,
i
am
very
uncomfortable
with
the
whole
notion.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
statutory
provision
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
prevent
unfair
competition?
unfair
competition,
not
unfair
trade
practices?
unfair
competition?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
answer
his
question?
i'm
still
left
with
a
lack
of
understanding
of
how
the
disparagement
of
the
--
of
the
composite
product
is
automatically
a
disparagement
of
your
chip?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
too
because
i'm
sick
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but
why
should
it
be
‶
arguably
″?
‶
arguably
″?
i
mean,
under
the
apa
you
are
dealing
with
suits
against
the
government
and
it's
just
funny
money
at
issue.
but
when
you
have
private
suits,
you
can
drag
somebody
into
court
simply
because
you
are
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interests
protected?
i'm
not
happy
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
whether
the
interest
is
reasonable.
it's
--
it's
whether
it
was
the
type
of
interest
that
the
statute
sought
to
protect.
and
the
term
‶
zone
of
interest
″
is
a
better
expression
of
that
concept,
it
seems
to
me,
than
‶
reasonable
interest
″.
i
mean,
you
know,
that's
my
objection
to
the
reasonable
interest
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
better--
justice
antonin
scalia
--‶
arguably
″
could
refer
to
factual
matters.
that
is,
you
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
if
certain
facts
are
established.
and
if
you
don't
establish
those
facts,
you
are
not.
that's
how
i've
always
understood
the
‶
arguably
″.
i
don't
think
it
means
‶
close
enough
for
government
work
″.
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
means
you
--
you
are
within
the
zone
of
interests
if
indeed
these
facts
that
you
have
asserted
exist.
