mr.
loy,
can
i
ask
you
what
you
think
this
standing
doctrine
is
all
about
in
a
context
like
this?
you
said
before,
you
said
to
give
--
to
effect
congress's
intent
in
passing
section
43.
is
that
what
we're
trying
to
do
here?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
one
of
the
questions.
why
isn't
that
the
only
question
that
we
ought
to
be
concerned
with
in
a
case
like
this?
congress
creates
a
right
of
action
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
normal
thing
that
we
ought
to
do
and
do
do
in
most
contexts
is
just
say,
you
know,
what's
the
scope
of
that
right
of
action?
and
--
and
certainly
we
could
take
into
account
congress's
purposes
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
that
right
of
action.
but
that
would
be
the
question.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess,
if
that's
the
question
the
agc
test
strikes
me
as
not
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
mean,
we
don't
usually
say
what
was
congress's
intent,
how
broad
did
congress
mean
for
this
cause
of
action
to
go,
and
then
sort
of
devise
a
five-part
test
with
a
lot
of
things
that
aren't
mentioned
in
the
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
--
mr.
loy,
you
said
there's
universal
recognition
that
there
should
be
prudential
standing
requirements
in
the
lanham
act.
when
should
there
be
prudential
standing
requirements
in
a
statutory
right
of
action?
in
other
words,
congress
passes
lots
of
statutory
rights
of
action.
and
let's
say
that
almost
never,
never
does
congress
talk
about
prudential
standing
one
way
or
the
other.
do
you
think
that
every
time
congress
passes
a
right
of
action,
the
courts
are
supposed
to
engage
in
a
kind
of
free-form
inquiry
about
what
kind
of
prudential
standing
rule
should
apply
to
that
particular
right
of
action?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
you
just
sort
of
know
them
when
you
see
them
or
it's
a
reaction
to
what
are
perceived
to
be
very
broad
statutes
or,
you
know,
when
--
when
do
we
know
that
we
should
be
offered
a
prudential
standing
jag?
justice
elena
kagan
but
there,
couldn't
that
be
done
just
by
interpreting
the
--
the
language
of
the
statue
in
accord
with
its
purposes,
because
you
have
a
specific
purpose
provision
in
the
lanham
act
that
says
we're
--
we're
trying
to
get
at
commercial
competition
here.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
jones,
is
the
question
that
you
are
asking
us
to
ask
just,
did
congress
want
this
kind
of
actor
to
be
able
to
sue?
is
that
the
question
that
you
think
we
ought
to
be
asking?
justice
elena
kagan
let's
not
call
the
limits
anything
in
particular.
the
question
in
your
view
is
congress
passes
this
act;
did
congress
--
including
this
right
of
action.
did
congress
want
this
kind
of
actor
to
be
able
to
use
that
right
of
action?
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
that's
correct,
i
mean,
rather
than
talking
about
whether
something
is
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interests
in
the
way
we
have
to
do
in
the
apa
context,
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
lot
of
statutes
that
don't
provide
rights
of
action
there,
why
shouldn't
we
just
ask,
what
kinds
of
actors
did
the
lanham
act
provide
a
right
of
action
to
as
sensibly
construed?
we
should
sensibly
construe
the
lanham
act
in
accordance
with
congress's
purposes.
justice
elena
kagan
and
then
what
would
be
the
test?
what
would
we
say
the
lanham
act
means?
justice
elena
kagan
what
i
think,
mr.
jones,
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
we
made
clear
that
‶
arguably
″
was
to
be
taken
very
seriously,
and
essentially
established
a
kind
of
buffer
zone
so
that
if
you
kind
--
we
weren't
going
to
be
too
strict
about
it.
and
the
reason
we
did
that,
again,
is
because
the
way
the
apa
works
is
it's
on
top
of
a
lot
of
federal
statutes
that
have
no
rights
of
action
themselves.
so
there
is
nothing
for
us
to
interpret
in
those
federal
statutes.
and
we
say,
well,
if
you
arguably
come
within
the
scope
of
that
statute,
then
you
are
aggrieved
for
purposes
of
the
apa.
but
this
is
a
very
different
situation.
this
is
a
situation
where
we
have
a
particular
right
of
action.
and
rather
than
create
any
kind
of
buffer
zone
around
it,
we
should
just
ask
how
is
it
sensible
to
interpret
that
right
of
action?
