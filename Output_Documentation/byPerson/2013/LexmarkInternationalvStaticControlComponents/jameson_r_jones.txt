mr.
jameson
r.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
some
of
this
questioning
indicated,
if
any
party
has
standing
under
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act,
it's
a
party
whose
goods
are
misrepresented
in
false
advertising.
to
remove
any
doubt
about
that
question,
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1988
to
ensure
a
cause
of
action
when
a
false
advertiser
misrepresents
the
goods
or
commercial
services
of,
quote,
‶
another
person
″,
end
quote.
this
court's
zone
of
interest
analysis
shows
that
parties
whose
goods
are
disparaged,
either
expressly
or
by
necessary
implication,
must
have
standing
to
sue.
lexmark's
simply
wrong
about
the
idea
that
the
zone
of
interest
analysis
in
the
lanham
act
does
not
impose
limits
upon
who
may
sue.
as
the
hypothetical
with
respect
to
the
bailey's
ice
cream
parlor
shows,
you
can
look
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
false
advertisement
to
see
whose
goodwill
and
commercial
activities
are
related
to
the
falsity
of
the
statement.
and
those
who
come
within
the
falsity
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
advertisement
at
issue
should
have
standing,
while
those
who
may
have
tangential
injuries
would
not.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
where
section
45
says
that
it
is
designed
to
protect
those
engaged
in
such
commerce
from
unfair
competition,
it's
referring
to
what
is
defined
in
the
operative
text
as
unfair
trade
practices.
unfair
competition
involves
specific
measures,
the
use
of
falsities,
that
can
injure
parties
who
are
not
necessarily
in
competition
with
one
another.
the
courts
as
a
whole
all
agree
that
a
competition
requirement
cannot
be
inferred
into
the
false
association
cause
of
action
that
is
also
unfair
competition
that's
part
of
section
43(a).
section
43(a)
goes
to
commercial
activity.
there
is
unfair
competition
in
the
sense
that
all
of
the
activity
under
it
is
commercial
and
competitive
in
that
sense.
but
some
narrow
form
of
competition
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
for
the
purposes
of
standing
is
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
section
43(a)
and
the
text
of
the
operative
paragraph.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
yes,
if
the
statements
are
about
the
legality
of
remanufacturing
lexmark's
printer
cartridges,
all
of
those
statements
are
about
static
control's
products
and
the
legality
of
using
them,
the
places
where
those
can
be
lawfully
used.
static
control
here
makes
microchips
and
parts
that
are
specifically
designed
for
the
very
commercial
activity
that
this
false
advertising
says
is
illegal.
in
that
sense,
static
control's
goodwill
and
commercial
relationships
are
all
very
closely
and,
by
necessary
implication,
talked
about
in
the
advertisements.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
as
mr.
loy
recognized,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
in
this
court's
opinion
in
daystar,
the
court
has
said
the
core
principle
of
the
lanham
act
as
a
whole
is
to
protect
commercial
actors'
goodwill
and
reputation,
and
that
can
be
seen
in
the
trademark
provisions.
it
can
be
seen
in
section
43(a)
itself.
and
i
think
that
basic
principle
means
that
there
is
a
tie
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
false
statements,
the
false
association,
and
that
can
apply
to
both
prongs
of
section
43(a)
to
where
there
is
a
nexus
between
the
subject
matter
of
what's
talked
about
and
the
person
who
is
injured.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
the
disparagement,
the
statements
about
the
uses
to
which
static
control's
products
may
be
put
are
all
implicit
in
all
of
the
false
advertisements
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
when
lexmark
says
that
remanufacturing
our
cartridges
is
illegal,
even
if
it
doesn't
mention
static
control
in
one
particular
advertisement,
all
of
that
goes
to
the
subject
matter
and
to
whether
or
not
static
control's
products
have
lawful
uses.
these
are
specifically
designed
for
this
very
commercial
activity.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
it
depends
upon
the
context
of
the
case.
in
many
circumstances
where
the
false
advertising
is
not
about
a
product,
those
products
will
have
multiple
different
uses,
such
as
commodity
products
that
are
supplied,
gears
and
springs
for
example,
that
may
have
many
different
uses,
the
false
statements
here
would
not
be
about
those
products.
and
those
manufacturers
can
sell
their
gears
to
many
other
different
uses
that
require
gears.
static
control's
microchips
here
only
work
for
remanufacturing
lexmark
printer
cartridges.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
i
think
if
it's
not
being
talked
about
in
that
case,
that
company
probably
would
not
have
standing.
but
the
fact
that
the
false
advertisements
in
that
case
were
about
the
chocolate
sauce
shows
why
the
chocolate
maker
needs
to
have
standing.
that
maker
has
different
incentives
vis
a
vis
the
person
who
is
operating
the
bailey's
ice
cream
store.
bailey's
ice
cream
store
could
decide
the
game's
not
worth
the
candle
and
we're
going
to
stop
buying
this
chocolate,
even
if
all
of
those
advertisements
are
false.
so
the
different
incentives
for
the
key
supplier
and
the
person
who
is
actually
within
direct
competition
means
that
to
further
the
purposes
of
the
lanham
act
a
party
whose
goods
are
misrepresented,
either
expressly
or
by
necessary
implication,
needs
to
have
standing.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
hear
from
justice
breyer,
the
statement
was:
the
chocolate
sauce
that
bailey's
uses
is
poisonous.
in
that
circumstance,
where
both
bailey's
is
mentioned
and
the
chocolate
sauce,
then
i
think
bailey's
would
have
to
have
standing.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
justice
breyer,
we
think,
respectfully,
that
the
circuits'
tests
don't
necessarily
encompass
this
situation
as
well
as
they
could,
which
is
why
we
suggest
that
it's
best
for
the
court
to
step
back
to
first
principles
of
prudential
standing,
which
is
the
zone
of
interest
analysis.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
in
2011
this
court's
opinion
in
thompson
v.
north
american
stainless
applied
the
zone
of
interest
test
to
a
private
dispute
under
title
7
as
to
whether
or
not
a
party
in
that
suit
had
a
private
cause
of
action
when
he
was
the
spouse
of
the
person
who
was
retaliated
against.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer,
because
the
zone
of
interest
test
requires
the
court
to
determine
what
the
purposes
behind
the
statute
are.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
in
the
lanham
act,
i
think
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
to
protect
those
engaged
in
such
commerce
from
unfair
competition,
from
false
statements.
and
once
that
is
defined
and
you
look
at
the
history
of
it,
and
it
seems
fairly
clear
from
the
history
that
it
is
designed
to
protect
commercial
actors.
once
that
is
defined,
those
parties
who
are
arguably
within
that
zone,
who
arguably
assert
those
interests,
should
have
standing.
and
that
‶
arguably
″
term
places
the
proper
thumb
on
the
scales
with
respect
to
what
is
otherwise
clear
statutory
text
that
is
being
interpreted
here,
that
generally
it
respects
the
role
of
the
judiciary
vis
a
vis
the
legislature
when
congress--
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
--justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
the
zone
of
interests
can
have
some
more
teeth,
perhaps,
than
the
reasonable
interest
test
because
it
tailors
what
is
the
interest
protected
to
the
text
and
history
of
the
particular
statute.
the
reasonable
interest
test,
if
properly
applied
with
all
of
that
in
mind,
would
i
think
be
applied
in
similar
ways.
but
the
zone
of
interest
test
has
the
directive
to
courts
that
each
time,
rather
than
thinking
what
is
reasonable
in
the
abstract,
to
think
about
what
congress
intended
to
protect
as
part
of
any
given
statute.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
so
you
would
look
at
the
subject
matter
of
that
false
advertisement,
and
as
you've
expressed
it
i
don't
believe
that
static
control's
products
would
be
within
the
subject
matter
about
the
vapor
of
lexmark's
printer
cartridges.
but
if,
for
example,
lexmark
were
to
say,
our
printer
cartridges
produce
a
quality,
a
quality
print
jobs,
then
--
and
it's
implicitly
talking
about
its
toner,
static
control
as
a
manufacturer
of
toner
may
have
standing
in
that
circumstance
because
by
comparison,
by
necessary
understanding
about
how
the
reputations
of
the
parties'
products
are
played,
static
control
might
have
standing
in
that
instance.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
in
that
situation,
i
think
remanufacturers
would
and
the
supplier
of
toners
that
is
necessarily
by
comparison
talked
about
in
that
false
advertisement.
when
a
party
only
talks
about
their
own
goods,
they
are
necessarily
going
to
be
very
difficult
cases
on
the
margins
as
to
where
the
ripples
of
the
subject
matter
of
that
false
advertisement
extend.
that
is
certainly
not
this
case
where
lexmark
falsely
advertised
that--
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
--if
the
court
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
‶
arguably
″
language
for
the
purpose
of
the
lanham
act,
we
don't
feel
we
have
a
dog
in
that
fight,
but
i
do
believe--
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
--yes.
if
there
are
going
to
be
prudential
limits
on
what
a
statute--
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
--yes,
yes.
and
in
the
1988
amendments
that
expanded
the
cause
of
action
to
ensure
a
right
of
action
when
a
false
advertiser
misstates
another
person's
goods,
that
amendment
should
be
dispositive
in
this
case.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
straightforward
way
to
deal
with
this
case,
justice
kagan.
i
think
the
zone
of
interest--
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
--the
lanham
act
means
that
those
parties
whose
goodwill
and
commercial
reputation
is
necessarily
affected
by
the
falsity
of
the
statement
have
standing
to
sue,
are
protected
by
the
lanham
act
and
able
to
stop
such
false
advertisements
and
able
to
seek
recompense
for
the
damages
that
are
suffered.
and
at
the
heart
of
that
are
those
parties
whose
goodwill
and
whose
commercial
services
are
expressly
misrepresented
or
implicitly
misrepresented
by
a
particular
false
advertisement
because
they
have
a
unique
interest
in
vindicating
their
reputations
and
making
the
false
advertisements
stop.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
justice
ginsburg,
this
court
has
talked
about
these
types
of
inquiries
as
prudential
limits
on
standing.
i
think
it's
perhaps
better
understood
as
interpreting
what
does
‶
any
person
″
really
mean
under
this
statute?
but
whether
it's
thought
of
as
prudential
standing
or
whether
static
control
falls
within
‶
any
person
″
or
has
‶
injuries
″
as
meant
by
the
statute,
the
inquiry
is
ultimately
the
same:
what
is
the
intent
of
congress?
what
was
their
core
purpose
in
this
act?
and
who
did
they
intend
to
sue?
and
in
the
text
here,
there
is
very,
very
broad
authorizing
language
that
gives
a
right
of
action
to
any
party
who
believes
that
he
or
she
is
or
is
likely
damaged
by
such
false
advertisement.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
i
think
in
that
situation
you
would
look
to
burger
king
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
probably
even
subway,
because
they
are
a
fast
food
company
that
advertises
itself
as
based
upon
lower
calorie
options,
would
have
a
standing
to
sue
in
that
context.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
sure.
so
in
each
of
those
contexts
subway
and
burger
king
can
say
that
their
goodwill,
their
relative
standing
in
the
marketplace,
has
been
necessarily
affected
by
mcdonalds's
false
advertisements
on
those
subjects.
and
if
you
get
to
looking
at
pleadings,
courts
would
look
to
whether
or
not
the
allegations
that
set
that
forth
are
plausible
and
meet
that
standard,
but
--
and
how
far
out
that's
going
to
go
is
for
another
day.
but
i
do
believe
it
would
be
permissible
for
courts
to
say
that
you
do
need
to
allege
that
sort
of
harm
to
goodwill
or
comparative
standing
in
the
marketplace
for
the
standing
to
exist
under
the
act.
lexmark's
requests
that
the
court
import
into
the
lanham
act
rules
from
the
antitrust
context
should
not
be
countenanced.
the
antitrust
laws
incorporated
the
common
law
itself,
as
this
court
said
in
leegin,
in
a
way
that
when
congress
prescribed
a
very
broad
set
of
actions
that
could
not
mean
what
it
said,
congress
necessarily
anticipated
that
there
would
be
some
judicial
policy
making
and
common
law
rulemaking
as
to
the
scope
of
a
cause
of
action
and
who
can
sue
under
it.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
reasonable
interest
test
and
explain
it
in
those
terms,
i
think
we
would
be
happy
with
that
result.
the
--
i
think
that
it
looks
--
it's
perhaps
a
little
bit
better
to
think
about
what
is
a
reasonable
interest
with
respect
to
the
proximity
to
the
falsity
of
the
statement,
to
the
subject
matter
of
what
was
at
issue,
because
you
are
dealing
with--
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
--and
that
is
precisely
why
in
our
brief
we
do
believe
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
court
to
step
back
to
that
level
and
talk
about
the
interests
in
protecting
goodwill
and
commercial
actors'
standing
in
the
marketplace
vis
a
vis
the
subject
matter
of
the
false
advertising.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
the
court
said
in
bennett
v.
spear
that
how
the
zone
of
interest
will
apply
will
depend
upon
the
text
and
history
of
the
statute,
and
it
will
vary
somewhat
based
upon
the
statutory
text
and
context.
and
if
for
different
types
of
statutes
the
court
can
look
to
what
congress
meant
to
protect
as
that,
and
i
believe
that
once
those
interests
are
defined,
the
‶
arguably
″
language
does
mean
that
in
a
close
case
parties
should
have
standing
because
that's
generally
what
--
when
courts
do,
when
they
are
interpreting
otherwise
clear
statutory
text,
i
think
the
deference
should
be
to
the
words
that
congress
passed
in
a
close
case.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
and
that
understanding
of
the
word,
justice
scalia,
would
fit
with
this
court's
pleading
rules
and
whether
or
not
somebody
has
plausibly
pled
certain
facts
that
would
show
that
the
test
is
met.
and
i
think
that
would
make
sense
in
this
context.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
two
responses
to
that,
justice
kagan.
i
do
believe
that
may
be
one
way
to
look
at
how
you
are
looking
at
prudential
standing
in
this
court's
doctrines.
in
certain
contexts
where
congress
has
abrogated
limits
on
suit
that
courts
have
erected
at
the
common
law
to
say
that
a
certain
cause
of
action
is
not
going
to
be
available
to
a
particular
plaintiff,
i
do
believe
courts
need
to
be
careful
in
applying
prudential
rules
to
avoid
resurrecting
those
same
policy
concerns
that
had
led
courts
to
say
that
no
cause
of
action
existed
in
the
first
place.
and
so
i
think,
at
least
in
this
context
where
you
have
a
brand
new
cause
of
action
that
did
not
exist
at
the
common
law,
that
‶
arguably
″
language
may
be
more
appropriate
than
with
respect
to
a
different
statute
where
there
are
different
issues
at
stake.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
competition
and
competitors
will
line
up
in
--
in
a
lot
of
ways
with
those
who
are
affected
by
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit.
i
don't
know
whether
it
makes
sense.
i
don't
believe
it
makes
sense
to
get
at
the
rule
as
competition
plus
those
who
are
talked
about
as
opposed
to
looking
to
who's
affected
by
the
falsity
of
the
statement
in
their
commercial
goodwill.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
i'm
not
sure
i
know
of
any
that
have
been
left
out
that
should
not
have
been
left
out.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
so
one
example
that
may
clarify
this
with
justice
alito's
question
about
competition
is
the
proctor
&
gamble
case
that
mr.
loy
talked
about.
that
was
a
false
advertisement
that
amway
made
about
the
lucrativeness
of
being
an
employee
of
amway.
proctor
&
gamble
is
a
direct
competitor,
but
should
not
have
standing
to
sue
for
those
false
statements
because
it's
not
related
to
amway's
statements
about
how
much
they
pay
to
their
employees.
the
subject
matter
doesn't
go
to
that
competitor
and
that
competitor's
product.
and
so
i
think
it's
better
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
where
--
what
the
falsity
of
the
statement
is
and
how
close
or
far
a
particular
plaintiff
is
to
that
statement
rather
than
trying
to
get
at
it
through
competition.
does
that
help,
justice
breyer?
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
no
circuit
has
adopted
it
as
the
test
for
the
lanham
act.
there
are
cases
that
talk
about
zone
of
interest
policies,
and
there
are
cases
that
talk
about
the
interests
of
protecting
goodwill
and
the
reputation
of
companies
who
are
involved
in
interstate
commerce.
but
the
other
tests
that
courts
have
layered
on
to
it,
i
think,
don't
necessarily
get
at
the
direct
question
that
is
really
at
issue,
which
is
did
congress
really
intend
for
these
injuries
to
be
the
subject
of
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
jameson
r.
jones
the
experience
--
justice
ginsburg,
the
experience
of
the
courts
would
show
that
applying
agency
actually
would
be
more
restrictive,
i
believe,
than
a
zone
of
interest
analysis.
two
of
the
factors
from
the
agc
test
are
facially
inconsistent
with
the
lanham
act.
the
concerns
about
the
speculativeness
of
damages,
at
least
as
it
relates
to
quantum
and
the
concern
about
the
complexity
and
apportionment
and
duplicative
damages
cannot
be
applied
here
in
a
statute
where
congress
explicitly
abrogated
limits
on
suit
related
to
certainty
of
damages.
section
43(a)
when
it
talks
about
a
cause
of
action
to
somebody
who's
likely
injured,
that
shows
that
those
concerns
about
damages
should
not
be
applied.
similarly,
the
flexibility
and
the
remedy
that
can
be
recovered
under
the
lanham
act,
in
terms
of
disgorgement
remedies,
injunctive
relief
and
a
party's
own
lost
profits
shows
that
concerns
about
those
factors
shouldn't
be
applied
either.
