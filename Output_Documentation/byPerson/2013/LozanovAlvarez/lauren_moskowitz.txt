ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
reverse
the
second
circuit's
holding
and
to
apply
equitable
tolling
to
article
12
would
be
squarely
at
odds
with
the
convention's
task,
purpose,
and
drafting
history,
as
well
as
contrary
to
the
post-ratification
understanding
and
interpretation
of
every
other
signatory
state
to
consider
the
issue.
your
honors,
we
ended
on
a
note
of
drafting
history,
and
to
return
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
about
turning
that
a
bit
on
its
head,
i
agree.
the
drafting
history
specifically
shows
that
the
countries
considered
two
periods:
one
of
prompt
return,
return
forthwith
within
6
months
of
the
removal;
and
6
months
from
the
discovery
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
child
if
the
child
were
not
known.
and
what
the
drafters
thought
--
some
thought
the
period
needed
to
be
longer,
but
there
were
countries
that
wanted
it
to
be
shorter.
there
were
countries
that
were
very
concerned
that
the
child
would
become
settled
in
the
new
environment
such
that
uprooting
that
child
again
just
for
purposes
of
having
a
custody
determination
in
the
--
in
the
former
country
of
habitual
residence
would
be
contrary
to
that
child's
interest.
so
they
struck
a
balance.
they
--
they
negotiated
over
--
over
several
drafts
and
finally
arrived
at
a
single
period
of
one
year.
but
that
wasn't
going
to
be
a
cutoff.
instead
of
having
a
statute
of
limitation,
statute
of
proposed
construct
they
said
the
obligation
is
going
to
continue
and
it's
going
to
continue
until
the
child
turns
16,
unless
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
child
is
now
settled
in
her
--
in
its
new
environment.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
your
concern
is
not
wrong,
but
i
think
it's
not
founded
on
what
--
what
will
happen
here.
i
don't
think
it
encourages
abduction
and
concealment,
because
that
--
those
facts
of
concealment
are
going
to
be
taken
into
account
into
whether
the
child
in
fact
is
settled.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
a
bit,
your
honor,
and
it's
--
the
abduction
itself
is
the
--
what
triggers
the
convention
to
begin
with.
every
single
case
that
is
heard
under
the
convention
involves
a
wrongful
removal
or
retention.
there
will
be
illegal
abduction
every
time.
and
the
drafters
in
fact
absolutely
were
trying
to
address
that
harm
to
children.
and
they
--
the
paramount
interest
of
the
children
were
designing
this
convention,
and
they
did
state
that
there
were
two--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
absolutely.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
it
does
not
consider
ultimately
the
custody
determination
and
with
which
parent
the
child
should
live.
that
is
expressly
not
part
of
the
convention,
and
that
is
what--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--yes,
your
honor,
i
would
presume
so.
but
as
well
as
any
wrongful
acts
of
either
or
both
parents
would
be
taken
into
account
in
the
full-blown
merits
best
interest
of
the
child
custody
determination.
what
the
convention
is
trying
to
address
in
the
instances
of
where
a
child
is
now
settled
in
a
new
environment
after
having
been
at
least
one
year
in
the
new
environment
is,
should
the
child
be
uprooted
in
anticipation
of
that
full-blown
hearing.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
yes,
your
honor.
and
just
to
address
the
one
point
that
the
petitioner
raised
of,
don't
worry
about
article
12
because
there's
article
13,
those
are
completely
different
constructs.
in
fact,
congress
recognized
that
when
it
set
a
different
burden
of
proof
for
defenses
under
article
13
as
opposed
to
the
well
settled
--
settled
analysis
under
article
12.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
no,
your
honor,
because
if
the
parent
is
concealing
the
child
--
for
example,
if
the
parent
is
moving
from
place
to
place
to
evade
detection
or
changing
the
child's
name
or
not
enrolling
the
child
in
school
to
avoid
detection--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
i
think--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--your
honor,
absolutely,
that
is
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
convention,
and
it
exists
because
that
was
presumed
to
be
contrary
to
the
interest
of
children.
and
i
don't
dispute
that.
in
the
majority
of
the
cases,
that's
true.
but
the
concept
that
the
drafters
had
to
grapple
with
this
issue
--
they
wanted
to
deter
child
abductions,
absolutely.
but
they
also
recognized
that
at
some
point
in
time
it
wasn't
going
to
be
just
about
children
at
large.
it
was
going
to
be
about--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--right.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
think
it
--
it
should
be
broader
than
that.
i
think
there
are
courts
that
--
the
article
13
defense
is
supposed
to
be
narrow
just
like
the
article
12-2
settled
exception.
but
the
settled
exception
isn't
enough
--
excuse
me,
article
13
isn't
enough
because
the
drafters
wanted
article
12,
too.
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
take
into
account
the
situation
of
the
child
after
this
one
year.
and
why
one
year
and
not
one
year
including
the
hearing,
i
think
it
was
a
balance.
the
drafters
were
concerned
both
that
it
was
going
to
be
too
long
and
that
it
was
going
to
be
too
short.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
that's
the
question
of
whether
and
to
what
extent
there
is
discretion
to
return
a
child
--
a
settled
child
under
article
12.
and
i
think--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--your
honor,
article
18
--
my
understanding
of
article
18
and
the
government's
interpretation
of
article
18
is
that
article
18
was
designed
not
as
a
duty
or
something
arising
under
the
convention,
but
a
recognition
that
the
convention
is
not
an
exclusive
statement
and
not
intended
to
occupy
the
space
on
child
abduction
and
return.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
i
struggle
with
this
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
reading
of
the
plain
language
that
says
no.
but
it's
--
there
is
a
general
feeling
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
escape
hatch--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--okay.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
in
--
in
that
question,
there's
--
there's
the
question
of
what
can
they
do
under
the
convention
and
what
can
they
do.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
no,
your
honor,
because
a
full-blown
merits,
best-interest-of-the-child
analysis
under
the
--
the
custody-type
family
court
proceeding
that
is
envisioned
to
follow
a
return
petition
under
the
convention
will
take
all
of
those
facts
into
account.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
prior
to.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
some
discretion
under
article
12
to
return
the
settled
child,
but
it
cannot
be
under
a
set
of
facts
that
were
completely
within
the
minds
of
the
drafters
when
they
chose
the
one-year
period.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
it's
hard
to
come
up
with
a
specific
example,
but
there
can't
--
it
can't
be--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--your
honor,
the
--
the
exception
to
whether
a
child
that
is
found
to
be
settled
after
all
the
facts--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--of
concealment
are
taken
to
--
into
account,
there
--
there
should
remain
some
discretion--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--no,
your
honor.
it's
the
discretion
under
article
12,
but
it's
in
the
same
vein
of
there
is
discretion
under
article
13
and
20,
as
well.
the
way
that
the
language
is
written
in
article
13,
for
example,
states
that
the
state
is
not
bound
--
i'm
on
136-a
of
the
petition
appendix
--
that
the
state
is
not
bound
to
order
the
return
if
it
is
established.
so
it
--
it's
not
saying
that
the
return
must
be
denied
if
these
defenses
are
established.
there's
slightly
different
language
in
article
12,
which
i
think
is
a
reflection
of
the
different
drafting--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
some
of
the
factors
you
pointed
out,
for
example,
that
there
would
be
no
serious
harm
if
the
child
were
returned,
not
necessarily
physical
harm
or
intolerable
situation
under
article
13,
but
there
--
article
12
settlement
does
take
into
account
roots.
it's
not
routine,
it's
not--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
no,
your
honor.
we
do
in
our--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--no,
your
honor.
it
shouldn't
be
read
that
broadly.
it's
certainly
--
and
the
house
of
lords
in
england,
in
in
re:
m,
did
find
that
there
was
a
residual
discretion
after
finding
a
child
was
settled.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor,
i--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--that's
the
way
the
house
of
lords
interpreted
it.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
no,
your
honor.
they
found
the
discretion
within
article
12.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--article
12,
you
are
absolutely
bound
to
return
the
child
unless
you
meet
one
of
these
exceptions
within
the
one
year,
forthwith
return.
prompt
--
prompt
return
is
the
idea
of
the
first
clause
of
article
12.
article--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--correct.
and
under
article
12-2,
that's
saying
the
child
--
the
court
shall
--
shall
also
order
the
return
after
this
1-year
period
unless
it
is
demonstrated.
and
the
question
is
what
happens
if
it's
demonstrated,
and
that's
do
you
have
to
return
still,
or
can
you,
or
do
you
have
to
keep
the
child
here?
and
i
think
what
the,
generally
the
courts
have
found
--
and
it's
not
unanimous
internationally;
it's
not.
hong
kong
says--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--your
honor,
i
think
those
facts
are
exactly
why
the
settled
exception
exists.
it
recognizes
that
the
--
the
reason
to
get
the
child
immediately
back
under
the--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
but
it
certainly
is
a
recognition
that
the
--
the
justification
for
return
and
prompt
return
is
in
part
to
return
to
the
status
quo
ante
of
where
child
was
for
purposes
of
having
a
custody
determination.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
your
honor--
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
--thank
you.
they're
--
the
courts
are
divided
internationally
on
whether
equitable
discretion
exists
to
return
a
child
that
has
been
determined
to
be
settled.
but
i
think
on
balance
there
should
be
some
level
of
equitable
discretion
to
return
a
settled
child,
but
not
under
--
simply
because
of
facts
of
concealment
that
were
firmly
within
the
minds
of
the
drafters
when
drafting
article
12.
ms.
lauren
a.
moskowitz
thank
you.
