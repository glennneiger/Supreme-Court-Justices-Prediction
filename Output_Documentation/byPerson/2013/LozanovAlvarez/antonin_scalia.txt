justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
it
in
the
materials?
justice
antonin
scalia
article
13,
which
you're
referring
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
which
of
the
articles
--
which
of
the
provisions
in
article
13
would
--
would
prevent
the
return
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
alito
just
gave
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
--
what
does
article
13
allow
the
court
to
consider?
it
says:
"it's
not
bound
to
order
the
return
if
the
person,
institution,
or
other
body
having
care
of
the
person
of
the
child
was
not
actually
exercising
the
custody
rights
at
the
time
of
removal
or
retention.
"
well,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
wouldn't
have
--
or
had
consent
to
or
--
that
wouldn't
apply
in
his
hypothetical
or
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
b:
"there
is
grave
risk
that
his
or
her
return
would
expose
the
child
to
physical
or
psychological
harm.
"
i
mean,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
--
that
your
client
would
--
would
harm
the
child
or
--
or
that
the
parent
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical
would
harm
the
child.
"or
otherwise
place
the
child
in
an
intolerable
situation.
"
i
don't
see
how
any
of
those
things
would
--
would
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
child
in
--
in
justice
alito's
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
physical
or
psychological
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
be
now
and
then,
but
in
the
routine
case
that
justice
alito
just
gave
you
i
don't
see
how
there's
any
--
any
reason
at
all
not
to
get
the
child
back
from
wherever
he's
been
for
10
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
article
13
does
not
say
the
child
--
the
child
can
state
--
well,
let's
see.
"the
child
objects
to
being
returned.
"
i
guess
you
could
limit
to
that.
"may
also
refuse
to
order
the
return
of
the
child
if
it
finds
that
the
child
objects
to
being
returned.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
the
one
exception,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
may
be
wrong.
who
cares
if
they're
wrong?
the
point
is
a
treaty
should
be
interpreted
uniformly
by
all
the
parties
to
it.
and
you're
telling
me,
well,
all
the
rest
of
them
interpret
it
another
way,
but
they're
wrong.
you
know,
everybody
is
out
of
step
but
me.
that's
--
that's
just
not
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
none
of
that
is
covered
by
the
treaty.
yes,
each
state
may
apply
its
own
law
with
respect
to
matters
not
covered
by
the
treaty.
but
i
do
not
read
that
to
say
to
me
that
each
state
may
apply
its
own
law
in
interpreting
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
and
so
can
create
exceptions
on
the
basis
of
equitable
discretion
when
the
treaty
has
none
or
because
its
courts
use
that
in
another
--
in
other
contexts,
or
create
an
exception
on
the
basis
of
equitable
tolling.
this
is
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
treaty,
not
of
bringing
into
effect
some
other
principle
of
--
of
state
law
that
overrides
the
treaty.
that's
how
i
read
that
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
had
it
in
mind,
not
just
the
interest
of
children,
but
the
interest
of
parents.
it's
simply
not
true
that
in
all
cases
involving
children
the
paramount
interest
of
the
child
governs.
that's
not
the
case,
or
else
we
would
remove
many
children
from
their
parents
in
this
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
parents
have
rights.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
this
treaty
considers.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
sotomayor
is
from
new
york.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
kagan's
question
has
to
be
no,
or
else
i
don't
understand
what
we're
doing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
--
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
give
us
an
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
don't
want
to
say
no.
it
seems
to
me
your
case
requires
you
to
say
no,
and
it's
no
help
to
me
to
say,
well,
you
know,
there
may
be
some
exceptions
that
i
can't
describe.
tell
me
the
exceptions
if
there
are
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
13,
right?
is
that
the
discretion
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
--
i
assumed
from
your
brief
that
that
was
not
the
reading
you
were
giving
it.
and
that
is
not
the
reading
it
has
to
be
given,
frankly.
i
read
it
the
other
way:
"shall
order
the
return
unless
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
child
is
now
settled.
"
i
assume
that
to
mean
in
which
case
you
shall
not
order
the
return.
isn't
that
the
way
you've
been
reading
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
is
not.
okay.
well,
then,
gee,
we
don't
have
a
lot
to
argue
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
moskowitz,
what
do
you
do
about
article
13
in
that
case,
which
begins:
"notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
article
--
of
the
preceding
article
12,
the
judicial
or
administrative
authority
requesting
is
not
bound
to
order
the
return
of
the
child
if
the
person.
"
--blah,
blah,
blah.
that
says
to
me
that
under
12
you
are
bound,
and
you're
telling
me,
well,
you're
really
not
bound
under
12.
you
have
discretion
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i,
frankly,
didn't
understand
that
that
was
your
argument
in
this
case
and
it
--
it
puts
the
whole
case
in
a
quite
different
light.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
government's
position
on
--
on
this
question
we've
just
been
discussing,
whether
article
12
is
absolute
or
whether
there
is
discretion
even
within
article
12,
even
though
specific
elements
of
discretion
are
contained
in
article
13?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
the
context
include
section
13,
which
--
which
lists
specific
reasons
why
you
can
depart
from
12?
i
mean,
it
seems
very
strange
to
say:
and
in
addition
to
that
there's
a
whole
pot
load
of
other
reasons
within
--
within
12
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
expect
all
the
signatories
to
this
treaty
to
come
up
with
essentially
the
same
exceptions,
under
--
under
what
you
say
is
--
is
the
interpretation
of
article
12?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
just
makes
that
article
impossible
to
apply
consistently
country
to
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
exercised
it?
have
they
exercised
it,
that
discretion
which
they
say
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
exercised
that
discretion
not
to
apply
the
--
the
mandatory
requirement
of
article
12?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
foreign
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
--
isn't
there
always
abduction?
as
your
friend
has
pointed
out,
the
whole
treaty
only
applies
where
the
child
has
been
abducted.
so
you
say:
oh,
well,
there's
a
special
exception
to
the
rules
of
the
treaty
where
the
child
has
been
abducted.
but
that's
what
the
treaty
applies
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
have
one
more
question.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
now
that
i
understand
the
government's
position,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
your
position
and
--
and
the
position
of
--
of
the
petitioner
here
except
that
he
wants
to
call
it
equitable
tolling,
and
you
want
to
say
we
can
take
concealment
into
account
under
section
12--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
apply
the
absolute
rule
where
there's
been
concealment.
i
don't
care
whether
you
call
it
equitable
tolling
or
not.
