ms.
shawn
p.
regan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
manuel
jose
lozano,
a
father
who
loves
his
daughter.
respondent
kidnapped
that
daughter
and
concealed
her
from
mr.
lozano,
first
in
the
united
kingdom
for
nearly
eight
months;
then
in
france,
then
in
the
united
states.
in
abbott,
this
court
recognized
child
abduction
to
be
one
of
the
worst
forms
of
child
abuse,
and
that
the
convention
therefore
aims
to
deter
and
prevent
child
abduction
from
occurring
in
the
first
instance.
equitable
tolling
furthers
that
aim.
by
contrast
the
rule
adopted
by
the
second
circuit
provides
a
playbook
for
thwarting
the
convention.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that
equitable
tolling
does
provide,
within
the
context
of
the
convention,
consideration
--
the
opportunity
for
courts
to
consider
the
interests
of
the
child.
and
that's
most
poignantly
illustrated
by
some
of
the
cases
in
which
it
has
been
applied.
if
i
may
provide
an
example.
an
example
in
respondent's
brief,
mendez
lynch
v.
mendez
lynch
on
page
31
of
their
brief.
it's
a
case
in
which
the
court
found
equitable
tolling
is
available,
and
it
found
equitable
tolling
applied
factually.
the
court,
however,
considered
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
child's
life,
including
those
facts
and
circumstances
that
relate
to
the
extent
to
which
the
child
is
settled;
but
it
considered
those
facts
and
circumstances
within
the
rubric
of
the
article
13
analysis,
and
that
is
consistent
with
what
other
courts
have
done
in
what
i
would
--
what
i
would
term
more
natural
article
12--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
and
i
think
this
is
important
because
i
think
this
--
this
illustrates
how
foreign
courts
have
miscomprehended
equitable
tolling,
how
it
would
operate,
how
it
operates
within
the
context
of
the
convention.
equitable
tolling
would
prevent
the
abducting
parent
from
taking
advantage
of
the
article
12-2
exception,
that
--
that
the
child
should
not
be
returned
because
the
child
is
now
--
because
the
parent
has
met
that
minimal
routine
showing
of
the
child
is
now
settled.
he's
going
to
school,
he
or
she
is
--
has
some
friends,
so
on
and
so
forth,
that
they
are
living
a
normal
life
here.
what
it
does
not
prevent,
and
mendez
illustrates
this,
as
do
other
cases,
it
does
not
prevent
the
court
from
looking
at
the
article
13
considerations.
so
for
example,
as
in
mendez
and
other
cases,
the
court
will
still
consider
if
the
child
--
if
the
child
is
of
sufficient
age
and
maturity
to
testify
such
that
this
court
should
take
into
account
his
or
her
views
or
objections
to
return,
the
court
can
do
so.

i'm
sorry.
it's
at
135a
of
the
petition
appendix.
excuse
me.
article
13
is
at
136a.
135a
is--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--grave
risk
of
harm.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--or
if
the
court
finds
that
it
would
be
an
intolerable
situation.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
i
respect,
justice
kennedy,
it's
difficult
to
balance
them.
they're
somewhat
incommensurate
or,
you
know,
competing
considerations
or
--
but
both
very
important.
we
think
that
equitable
tolling
properly
balances
them
within
the
structure
of
the
convention
because
equitable
tolling,
again,
it
--
it
prevents
this
article
12-2
exception,
but
it
doesn't
prevent
the
article
13
exception.
in
fact,
in
many
ways
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
inconsistent
with
what
the
english
court
does
or
did
in
cannon.
in
cannon,
the
court
said
if
--
where
there
is
concealment
and
subterfuge,
there
will
be
a
heightened
burden
for
establishing
settlement.
now,
in
this--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--i
think--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--well,
justice
kennedy,
to
your
point
about
timing
and
essentially
provisional
return,
i
do
think,
you
know,
courts,
district
courts
have
shown
great
adeptness
at
dealing
with
those
issues.
they've
entered
conditional
orders
that
require
the
child
be
returned
at
a
time
when
the
proceeding
--
when
the
testimony
is
necessary.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
there
is
a
significant
difference.
and
we
think
that
that
significant
difference
is
warranted
and
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
the
effect
of
deterrence,
because
the
second
circuit's
rule
essentially
says
to
abducting
parents:
if
you
abduct
your
child
and
you
conceal
your
child
for
12
months,
you
will
be
rewarded.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
justice
alito,
i
hope
to
make
abundantly
clear
that
our
position,
equitable
tolling,
would
not
mandate
that
that
child
be
returned.
all
it
does
--
but
it's
significant--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--it
--
it
changes
the
question
that
the
court
asks.
absent
equitable
tolling,
the
courts
--
the
question
on
which
--
the
question
before
the
court
is:
is
this
child
settled?
and
the
factors
the
court's
looked
at,
the
courts
have
looked
at
it,
and
it
really
--
they're
--
you
know,
settlement
is
not
defined
in
the
convention
and
congress
has
left
it
to
courts
to
decide.
and
courts
look
at--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--courts
have
looked
at
--
and
i'll
say
it
--
in
the
decades--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--that's
known
as
acquiescence.
ms.
shawn
p.

it's
really
b.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
if
i
may
explain
by
way
of
illustration
in
some
of
the
cases
what
courts
have
looked
at.
and
let
me
give
--
blondin
is
another
example
cited
in
our
brief,
cited
by
the
solicitor
general,
a
second
circuit,
the
well-known
second
circuit
case.
that's
a
natural
article
12-1
case.
petition
is
filed
before
the
period
of
one
year
expires.
the
second
circuit
looked
at
--
or
judge
chin,
then-judge
chin
in
the
district
court,
looked
at
the
child's
facts
and
circumstances
related
to
settlement
as
part
of
that
grave
risk
analysis.
there
was
expert
testimony,
as
there
often
is
in
these
cases,
that
the
child
was
suffering
from
potential
--
from
post-traumatic
stress
disorder.
experts
testified
that
return
of
the
child
--
the
child
should
not
be
returned
because
it
presented
a
grave
risk
of
harm
to
the
child.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
that's
correct.
and
there
are
cases,
mendez
v.
lynch
and
others.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
if
i
may
answer
in
two
ways
in
the
example
justice
alito
gave.
with
a
10-year-old
child,
it's
--
it's
very
likely
that
the
court
would
hear
from
that
child.
i
think
the
more
difficult
example
is
let's
make
that
child
7
or
8.
but
--
and
--
and
there's
no
evidence
these
cases
have
occurred.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
united
states
court.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
that's
been
universally
adopted
by
the
courts
hearing
testimony.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
but
--
but
the
grave
risk
exception,
and
courts
have
applied
this,
it
really
--
it
really
just
--
it
--
it
changes
the
question,
like
in
cannon.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
i
understand
that
point.
however,
there
is
a
difference.
and
so
what
we're
trying
to
balance
here,
and
i
think
--
it's
not
we.
what
the
convention
balances,
what
courts
applying
the
convention
have
found
is
the
proper
balance,
is
not
for
courts
to
say,
well,
let's
try
and
figure
out
what
the
best
interests
are.
in
fact,
the
convention
couldn't
be
clearer
and
congress
couldn't
have
been
clearer
that
that
is
not
where
it
--
that's
where
it
least
wanted
courts
wading
into
those
waters.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
okay.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
i
think
we
have
a
lot
going
for
us.
you've
asked
--
i
think
you've
hit,
justice
breyer,
on
just
about
every
issue
that
i
could
possibly
want
to
address
today.
but
--
and
--
and
let
me
say,
i
--
i
respect
the
position
of
the
8
or
9-year-old
child,
the
difficulty.
i
was
that
child
before
a
judge
on
the
--
giving
that
sort
of
testimony.
so
i
certainly
appreciate
it.
but
on
this
--
this
question
of
best
interests,
the
convention
makes
the
decided
choice
if
courts
--
the
convention
defines
how
courts
are
to
determine
that
best
interest.
it
doesn't
say
courts
should
determine
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
it
says
look
at
whether
the
child
is
settled
under
article
12
or,
if
that's
not
applicable,
you
may
look
at
article
13.
other
than
that,
the
presumption
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child
is
for
return.
you
mention
that
the
state
department
is
against
us,
which
i'm
happy
to
take
the
opportunity
to
address
here.
we
don't
believe
that
the
state
department's
views
should
be
accorded
great
weight
in
this
situation.
their
brief
does
not
speak
to
the
diplomatic
consequences
of
equitable
tolling.
it
doesn't
speak
to
--
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
idea
that
equitable
tolling
will
somehow
impair
our
ability
to
recover
children
abducted
from
the
united
states.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
domestic
violence
situation,
which
i
am
entirely
sensitive
to
and
appreciate,
illustrates
the
difficulty
of
these
cases
and
--
and
that
courts
can't
really
figure
out
what's
--
who's
right
or
who
did
what
in
these
circumstances.
most
of
--
usually
all
of
the
evidence
is
overseas
on
that
issue.
what
the
convention
--
the
approach
the
convention
decides
on
taking
is
that,
first,
there
is
no
self-help
remedy
certainly
for
concealment,
that
--
that
nothing
excuses
concealment
of
the
child.
and,
in
fact,
to
the
extent
you
said
there's
a
goal
and
a
value
of
shortening
these
proceedings,
to
the
extent
equitable
tolling
disincentivizes
concealment,
it
does
that.
i
mean,
the
opposite
rule
says
if
you
conceal,
i.e.,
you
extend
that
period
of
time
during
which
there's
no
relationship,
you'll
be
rewarded.
it's
an
enormous
incentive.
and
our
point
is
there
is
the
proper
safety
valve.
the
standard
under
article
12-2
is
so
pedestrian,
it
is
essentially
have
you
failed
to
be
--
aside
from
abducting
your
child,
since
then,
have
you
failed
to
be
a
normal
parent?
is
your
child
in
school?
does
he
or
she
go
to
ballet
class?
do
you
take
him
or
her
to
church?
do
they
have
friends?
all
those
things
were
satisfied
here.
can
you
be
employed?
what's
your
legal
--
what's
your
immigration
status?
now,
this
case
illustrates
just
how
simple
and
routine
that
is
to
achieve.
and
here,
she
didn't
have
a
child.
she's
not
here
legally.
i
guess
the
court
found
that
she
had
the
depth
and
quantity
of
friendships
that
your
typical
pre-kindergartner
has,
and
that
was
enough
for
her
to
defeat
return.
the
convention
properly
balances
these
things
by
saying
where
it
presents
--
and
courts
have
done
this.
the
district
courts
are
doing
this.
no
one
says
--
you
know,
the
state,
the
solicitor
general
and
our
respondent
--
points
to
a
single
case
where
they
say,
here's
equitable
tolling
and
boy,
you
know,
the
court
got
it
wrong.
here
was
the
wrong
outcome
because
they
applied
equitable
tolling
as
they
have
been
doing
for
nearly
two
decades.
courts
can
do
this.
but
the
question,
as
it
is
in
cannon,
can't
be
as
simple
as
well,
are
you
--
are
you
doing
fine
here
in
the
united
states?
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
we
believe
that
it's
neither
surprising
nor
momentous
that
foreign
courts
have
failed
to
adopt
equitable
tolling.
it's
not
surprising
because
they
lacked
the
presumption
that
we
do.
it's
not
as
significant
for
two
reasons.
one,
we
think,
as
i've
alluded
to,
i
think
they
miscomprehend
equitable
tolling.
the
cannon
count
calls
it
too
crude,
that
it
won't
allow
for
an
accounting
of
the
child's
interest.
and
as
--
as
the
courts
in
the
united
states
have
been
clear,
it
does.
it
provides--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--not
at
all,
justice
scalia.
and
it
was
actually
--
your
question
relates
to
my
third
point.
what
those
decisions
reflect
is
that
the
convention
leaves
room
within
article
12
for
the
operation
of
domestic
law.
article
12
speaks
to
commencement
of
proceedings.
you
must
commence
proceedings
within
one
year.
it
speaks
to
settlement.
the
convention
--
it
is
congress
in
icara
that
defines
how
one
commences
proceedings.
it
says
you
must
file
in
a
court
that
has
jurisdiction.
that's
section
11603(b)
and
(f)(3),
which
are
at
117
through
121a
of
the
petition
appendix.
congress
decides
that's
how
you
--
how
you
stop
that
period,
by
filing
in
a
court
having
jurisdiction.
other
countries
provide
nation
--
courts
of
nationwide
jurisdiction.
some
countries
provide
that
the
central
authority
itself
will
file
the
petition
for
the
applicant
or
will
file
in
its
own
interest
on
behalf
of
the
child.
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
our
position
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
drafting
history
here,
the
drafting
history
was
preliminary
draft
article
11
provided
for
two
periods:
automatic
return,
if
you
will,
return
subject
to
the
article
13
and
20
defenses
if
you
file
within
6
months;
or
for
a
period
--
a
discovery
rule
capped
at
one
year
if
you
didn't
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
child.
some
countries
said
those
periods
are
too
short,
some
said
they're
too
long.
some
said
we
don't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
this
discovery
rule
issue,
concerned
about
the
evidentiary
burdens.
what's
important
is
what
the
drafters
did.
they
extended
that
first
period
to
a
year
and
then,
with
respect
to
this
discovery
rule
concept,
they
said:
we're
going
to
give
you
article
18,
it
provides
for
return
at
any
time;
we're
going
to
provide
article
34,
which
the
explanatory
report
highlights,
is
meant
to
provide
for
invocation
of
domestic
law
or
rules,
particularly
where
12-2
is
implicated.
and
it
left
for
countries
to
define
the
--
to
define
key
elements
of
article
12-2.
in
doing--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--justice
sotomayor,
we
believe
that
the
state
department's
reading
of
that
history,
of
that
drafting
history,
is
oversimplified
because
there
were
objections
to
that
period,
to
that
--
to
that
discovery
rule
that
weren't
simply
to
a
discovery
rule
as
a
general
matter.
it
was
that
some
countries
said:
we
don't
want
to
have
to
deal
with
that.
other
countries
said
it
needs
to
be
longer.
and
so
the
choice
that
was
made
was
a
choice
to
give
countries
flexibility
to
determine
how
they
want
to
calculate
that
period,
when
it
should
be
set,
and
potentially
to
employ
equitable
tolling.
the
jurisdiction
convention--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--the
jurisdiction
convention
is
consistent
with
that
idea.

the
difference
is
not
that
a
court
cannot
take
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
child's
life
into
account.
it
can.
that
is
--
that
is
the
mendez
case.
that's
reyes
olguin.
that's
blondin.
there
are
innumerable
cases
that
show
that.
they
can
--
the
court
can
take
that
into
account.
it's
just
a
question
of
what
is
the
question
to
which
the
court
applies
those
facts.
under
our
circumstance,
it's
not
this
article
12-2,
is
the
child
doing
fine
here?
is
the
child
living
a
normal
life?
it's
a
different
question.
is
the
--
is
the
goal
and
motive
and
presumption
for
return
going
to
be
defeated
here
because
it
would
present
a
risk
of
harm
to
the
child?
we
think
that's
the
right
question
because
that's
the
only
question
that
deters
concealment.

well,
the

proceeding
would
occur

that
is
the
question.
and
also
the
question
is
how
do
we
deter--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--and
our
concern
here,
justice
breyer--
ms.
shawn
p.
regan
--our
concern
is
the
deterrence
and
prevention,
which
is
the
goal
of
the
convention.
justice
scalia
asked
about
other
nations
in
uniformity.
and
there
could
be
no
better
reflection
about
the
room
created
in
article
12
and
that
this
--
that
the
uniformity
is
not
--
or
that
this
is
not
a
problem
where
we
need
to
be
so
concerned
about
uniformity.
in
2006,
through
the
special
commission
process,
the
meeting
of
the
--
of
the
members
of
the
convention,
the
united
states
specifically
apprised
the
other
nations
that
it
was
employing
equitable
tolling
in
the
12-2
context.
as
the
government
concedes,
no
one
else
disagreed.
no
one
expressed
any
concern
about
the
united
states
doing
that.
that's
a
clear
reflection
that
there
is
this
room
in
article
12.
government's
and
respondent's
position
is
that
concealment
may
be
taken
into
account.
the
problem
there
is
the
respondent
still
has
this
enormous
incentive
to
conceal,
which
is
the
purpose
--
that's
the
primary
goal,
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
concealing
abduction.
that's
the
goal
of
the
convention.
but
also,
there's
no
standard.
they
haven't
articulated
a
standard.
the
government
doesn't
articulate
one.
it
--
it
amounts
to
a
standard
that
says
concealment
matters
unless
it
doesn't.
that's
an
enormous
--
that
ephemeral
standard
is
very
difficult
for
a
respondent
to
overcome.
it's
very
difficult
for
a
district
court
to
apply.
and
what
it
does
is
it
creates
this
incentive
to
conceal,
because
no
one
even
knows
what
the
question
is.
equitable
tolling
defines
the
question
within
the
context
of
the
convention.
it
says
by
tolling,
this
is
the
question
you
should
answer.
if
there's
not
to
be
tolling
and
there
are
lots
of
courts
--
lots
of
cases
where
courts
have
found
we
shouldn't
toll
because
the
child
wasn't
concealed
or
the
parent
didn't
exercise
due
diligence
finding
the
child,
then
we'll
ask
the
article
12-2
question,
whether
the
child
is
settled.
the
bottom
line
is
equitable
discretion
will
result
in
the
abduction
of
more
children.
equitable
tolling
will
disincentivize
that.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
those
cases
i
mentioned,
mendez,
blondin.
reyes
olguin
is
another
one.

now,
that's
