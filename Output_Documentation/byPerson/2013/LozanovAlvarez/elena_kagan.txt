mr.
regan,
justice
breyer
pointed
out
that
all
other
countries
seem
to
disagree
with
you.
that's
obviously
a
concern
of
ours
when
we
interpret
a
treaty,
that
all
other
countries
interpret
it
in
a
--
in
a
single
way.
do
you
contest
that?
are
there
any
other
countries
that
apply
equitable
tolling
rules?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
moskowitz,
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
could
you
tell
me
how
you
think
this
works?
you
said,
in
response
to
justice
alito,
that
sometimes
concealment
can
be
a
factor
in
determining
whether
a
child
is
settled.
and
i
presume
you
mean
if
somebody
conceals
the
child
by
moving
the
child
from
place
to
place,
the
child
would
not
be
settled.
is
it
also
a
factor
in
determining
whether
a
settled
child
should
nonetheless
be
returned?
justice
elena
kagan
or
under
article
18.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
but
prior
to
that.
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
could
go
back
to
--
do
you
agree
with
justice
scalia,
that
really,
at
that
point,
there's
nothing
to
do?
once
the
determination
has
been
made
that
the
child
is
settled,
there
is
no
remaining
discretion
that
the
judge
has?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
that's
the
case,
if
you're
reading
it
that
way
--
i
mean,
i
was
reading
it
justice
scalia's
way,
too.
justice
elena
kagan
the
first
clause
says
shall
and
the
second
clause
says
shall
not.
but
there
is
an
alternate
reading
where
the
first
clause
says
shall
and
the
second
clause
essentially
says
"may
or
may
not
at
your
discretion.
"
but,
boy,
that
would
open
up
a
big
discretionary
hole
if
you
read
it
that
way,
wouldn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
if
i
understand
the
way
you
think
this
works,
you
don't
--
there's
not
even
a
presumption
that
a
settled
child
will
stay,
right?
you're
just
saying
once
you've
found
a
settled
child,
the
obligation
to
return
the
child
goes
away,
but
at
that
point
it
really
is
a
kind
of
all
things
considered
inquiry
with
no
presumption
operating
at
all,
just
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
treaty?
