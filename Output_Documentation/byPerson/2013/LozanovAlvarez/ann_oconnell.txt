ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--it's
our
position
that
under
article
12
there
is
discretion
to
return
a
settled
child,
and
that
that
comes
from
article
12
itself.
as
you
pointed
out,
the
language
of
article
12
says
that
if
more
than
a
year
has
passed
the
court
shall
order
the
return
of
the
child,
unless
the
child
is
settled
in
her
new
environment.
and
that
--
i
mean,
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
could
be
read
in
two
ways,
and
the
court
has
said
that
when
the
similar
except
shall
formulation
--
and
we
cited
in
our
brief
the
department
of
commerce
v.
u.s.
house
of
representatives
case.
the
similar
except
shall
language,
it's
interpreted
depending
on
the
context
in
which
it
appears.
and
we
think
it's
very
clear
from
the
convention
that
in
the
context
of
the
convention,
and
specifically
article
12,
that
the
better
reading
is
that
a
settled
child
may
be
returned.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
article
--
it's
true
that
articles
13
and
20
are
written
in
expressly
discretionary
language,
but
those
are
sort
of
set
out
as
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
article
12.
article
12
is
written
up
differently,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
convention
that
ever
says
that
a
child
has
to
stay
in
the
country
where
she
has
been
abducted.
ms.
ann
o'connell
in
exercising
the
discretion
the
court
should
be
--
it's
not
just
a
free
--
free-wheeling
discretion
that
the
court
is
exercising
under
article
12.
we
think
it's
guided
by
the
purposes
stated
in
the
convention.
so
yes,
first
you
look
at
whether
the
child
is
settled,
and
that
could
be
enough
to
defeat
the
presumption
that
an
abducted
child
should
be
returned.
you
can
also
look
at
whether
the
child
could
easily
resettle
if
the
child
was
sent
back.
for
example,
a
10-year-old
child
who
was
in
school
and
had
a
lot
of
friends
and
a
routine
in
london
was
abducted
to
the
united
states
for
a
year.
that
child
may
not
--
may
be
settled
in
the
united
states,
but
she
may
not
have
a
difficult
time
resettling.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
--
and,
the
other
signatories
have
--
have
almost
all,
i
mean
i
think
the
hong
kong
court
does
say
that
it
doesn't
have
discretion,
but
it
said
in
that
case
nevertheless
it
would,
even
if
it
had
discretion,
it
wouldn't
order
the
children
returned.
but
the
other
courts
of
signatory
countries
that
have
interpreted
article
12
have
all
found
a
discretion,
whether
it
be
in
article
12
or
in
article
8.
and
if
i--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
mean--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes.
i
mean,
courts
in
the
united
states
have
done
that.
i
think
courts
in,
in
other
countries--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--have
as
well.
yes.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
i
think
the,
the
last
part,
justice
kagan,
is
the
most
important
part,
that
it
has
to
be
guided
by
the
objectives
of
the
treaty;
that
it's
not
a
free-wheeling,
best
interests
of
the
child
analysis
or
where
this
child
should
be,
but
you
could
take
into
account
the
principle
in
article
12
that
it's
harmful
to
uproot
a
settled
child,
but
you
can
also
weigh
against
that
the
idea
that
this
convention
is
really
geared
in
the
first
place
toward
preventing
abduction.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
if
there's
--
if
there's
reason
to
send
the
child
back,
even
--
even
a
settled
child,
we
think
that
the
purposes
of
the
convention
should
--
should
prevail
there.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that
the--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that
the
parent
engaged
in
behavior
like
concealing
the
child
that
is
--
that
is
not
condoned
under
the
convention,
that--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--we
think
the
court
--
i
mean,
the
court
has
discretion,
we
think,
to
order
a
child's
returned
even
if
she's
settled.
i
mean,
that
--
that
discretion
could
be
abused
if
a
child
has
been
in
the
united
states,
for
example,
for
5
years
and
the
court
says,
well,
the
child
was
being
concealed
so
we
will
send
the
child
back.
but
--
but
we
think
--
and
there
will
be
some
cases
in
which
the
court
could
probably
not
abuse
its
discretion
by
deciding
the
case
either
way.
but
yes,
we
think
on
the
one
hand
equitable
tolling
is
not
a
good
way
to
deal
with
this
problem,
because
article
12
specifically
wants
courts
to
take
into
consideration
the
interest
of
the
child--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that's
--
that's
right.
i
don't
think
any
of
these
decisions
are
from
the
highest
court.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
ms.
ann
o'connell
we
understand
that
an
abduction
is
going
to
take
place
in
every
case.
i
think
we
are
looking
for
something
more
than
what
happened
in
this
case,
some
sort
of
concealment
that
happened,
so
that
the
parent
that
is
left
behind
and
looking
for
the
child
cannot
find
him.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--the
first
thing
i'll
point
out
is
that
article
12,
the
drafters
assumed
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
difficulty
in
locating
children,
and
they
decided
on
this
one-year
period.
but
also
point
out
the
state
department
dedicates
significant
resources
to
finding
children
that
are
thought
to
have
been
abducted
to
the
united
states.
they
have
access
to
all
sorts
of
federal
law
enforcement
databases
to
try
to
determine
if
the
child
has
come
here.
they
have--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--typically,
the
left-behind
parent
will
approach
the
central
authority
in
his
or
her
own
country,
and
typically
with
an
idea
of
what
the
abducting
parent's
connections
are
to
other
countries.
and
so
if
the
united
states
is
singled
out
as
a
country
to
which
the
child
might
have
been
taken,
the
mexican
central
authority
would
contact
the
united
states
central
authority,
and
immediately
somebody
would
be
assigned
to
start
looking
for
that
child
within
the
united
states.
and
there
are
a
great
number
of
resources
that
are
channeled
toward
that
through
the
state
department
in
working
with
other
federal
agencies,
the
--
the
crime
databases,
the
federal
parent
locater
service
that's
used
to
track
down
people
in
the
united
states
to
pay
child
support.
it
works
with
state
law
enforcement
agencies
who
can
check
school
records
and
driver's
license
records
and
things
like
that.
so
it's
not
like
it's
--
i
mean,
it
is
difficult.
we
are
acknowledging
that
it's
quite
difficult.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
i
mean,
we
think
--
the
convention
starts
with
the
presumption
that
a
settled
child
should
be
returned.
and
so
the
starting
presumption
is
always
that
you
should
not
abduct
the
child--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--excuse
me?
ms.
ann
o'connell
that
--
that
an
abducted
child
should
be
returned.
ms.
ann
o'connell
when
the
--
a
determination
that
the
child
is
settled
can
overcome
that
presumption,
and
then
the
other
equitable
factors,
like
concealment,
come
into
play.
ms.
ann
o'connell
no--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
think
the
positions
are
quite
different,
because
under
an
equitable
tolling
analysis,
putting
aside
that
you
may
be
able
to
satisfy
a
different
convention
defense,
like
one
under
article
13
or
20,
under
an
equitable
tolling
analysis,
the
court
would
be
prohibited
from
taking
into
account
whether
the
child
is
settled
in
her
new
environment
in
determining
whether
to
send
her
back.
