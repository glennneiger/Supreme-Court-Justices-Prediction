justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
convention
says
in
the
preamble
that
the
parties
--
that's
countries
--
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
interests
of
the
children
are
of
paramount
importance
in
matters
relating
to
their
custody.
okay?
paramount
importance.
so
the
provision
you're
talking
about,
article
13,
says,
well,
would
returning
the
child
lead
to
physical
harm,
psychological
harm,
or
otherwise
put
the
child
in
an
intolerable
position.
so
they
mean
intolerable.
so
i
think
this
would
be
a
pretty
typical
case.
the
husband
says
he
was
fine.
the
wife
says,
no,
he
kicked
me
in
the
stomach
and
did
a
lot
of
other
things.
the
judge
hearing
the
two
sides
says
i
can't
say
the
husband's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
don't
know.
now,
your
idea
is
to
send
the
child
back
to
the
husband
unless
the
child
gets
up
there
and
chooses
between
parents.
that's
pretty
tough
on
8
or
9
or
10-year-old
children
and
--
very
tough.
and
you're
going
to
keep
--
the
--
you're
going
to
send
it
back
to
the
father
in
this
situation
unless
the
mother
can
prove
it's
intolerable,
either
because
of
physical
--
i
mean,
my
goodness,
a
physical
or
psychological.
all
the
doctors
saying
he
should
stay
in
new
york.
a
typical
problem
for
a
family
court
judge,
really
tough.
so
you
have
the
convention
which
says
in
the
preamble
look
to
the
interests
of
the
child.
you
have
every
other
country
saying
that's
what
it
really
means;
in
other
words,
they're
against
you.
you
have
the
department
of
state,
in
charge
of
the
treaty,
saying
that's
what
it
really
means
and
otherwise
against
you.
and
so
what
do
you
have
going
for
you?
that
isn't
your
fault
that
there
isn't
too
much
going
for
you,
but
nonetheless,
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
the
answer?
i'd
like
a
straight
answer
in
your
opinion,
because
justice
kagan's
case,
the
mother
kidnaps
the
child.
they
live
in
a
grain
elevator,
a
nicely
refurbished
grain
elevator,
in
peoria
for
a
year.
and
after
the
year,
a
month
later
the
father
finds
both
of
them,
goes
to
a
family
judge
--
a
very
tough
job
by
the
way
--
and
the
family
judge
reads
this
and
he
says,
well,
i
have
to
admit
the
child
is
settled
here
now
in
iowa.
all
right.
is
settled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
send
the
child
back
to
london,
he's
going
to
be
just
about
as
settled.
i
mean,
really,
it's
not
that
much
difference.
but
i
can't
say
the
child
is
not
settled.
the
father
says
this
is
the
most
unfair
thing
i've
ever
seen.
she
hides
out
for
a
year.
the
child
could
be
just
as
well
back
in
london.
almost
as
well.
who
knows?
maybe
better.
but
now,
what
can
the
family
court
do
--
judge
do?
that's
the
straight
question
we've
been
trying
to
get
your
answer
to
that,
and
it
isn't
an
answer
to
say
--
you
could
say,
if
that's
the
answer,
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
can
they
do?
i
just
want
to
know
if
the
family
court
judge
will
say
please
settle
this,
and
the
two
of
them
won't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
now
what
can
the
judge
do?
is
the
father
simply
out
of
luck
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
can
you
give
me
any
authority?
i
read
that
exactly
in
article
12,
but
you've
now
given
me
a
different
impression.
what
article
12
says
is
that
if
it's
less
than
a
year,
the
child
is
returned
forthwith.
if
it's
more
than
a
year,
the
child
shall
be
returned
forthwith
unless
--
unless
it
is
demonstrated
the
child
is
now
settled
in
its
new
environment.
it
doesn't
say
you
don't
return
it
if
the
child
is
now
well
settled
in
the
environment.
it
just
says
you
don't
have
to
return
it
forthwith.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
would
have
thought
that
that
would
have
opened
room
for
discretionary
factors.
but
you
have
not
given
me
a
case
that
said
that
that's
so.
you
have
not
given
me
anybody
who
said
that
what
i
thought
was
the
natural
reading,
and
which
you'd
like
to
be
the
natural
reading,
you've
not
given
any
support
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
the
natural
reading.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
should
read
that
case
because
the
language
says,
"unless
it
is
demonstrated
the
child
is
now
settled.
"
"you
return
it
forthwith
unless
it
is
demonstrated
the
child
is
well
settled.
"
well,
now
it's
demonstrated
well
settled.
does
that
mean
i
cannot
return
it?
or
does
it
mean
i
don't
have
to
return
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
say
--
or
you
say
i
read
that
case
in
the
house
of
lords
and
i
will
discover
it
means
you
don't
have
to
return
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
--
can
i
ask
you
how
it
works
here?
i
realize
i
don't
know.
a
year
has
passed.
the
father
never
found
out
where
the
child
was.
now
he
suddenly
finds
out.
he
runs
to
iowa.
the
judge
looks
at
this
convention,
and
he
says,
well,
the
year's
passed.
you've
lost,
let's
say.
and
i
don't
have
to
--
i
don't
have
to
return
him
forthwith.
the
child's
not
going
to
suffer
intolerable
injury.
i
can't
use
that.
i
don't
have
to
return
him
forthwith.
now,
i
look,
is
he
settled?
yes.
he's
settled.
all
right.
end
of
the
matter.
but
do
we
now,
in
the
discretion
of
the
father,
have
a
custody
hearing?
the
father
can
say,
yes,
all
that's
true,
but
i
should
have
custody.
and
he
goes,
and
under
iowa
law,
we
see
who
is
entitled
to
custody.
and
he
has
something
going
for
him.
namely,
the
mother's
acted
pretty
badly,
unless
she
has
excusing
circumstances
in
abducting
the
child.
does
that
happen
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
would
go
to
the
family
court.
so
is
that
--
would
that
happen?
could
that
happen?
of
course,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
the
answer
is
of
course,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
on
the
one
hand,
we
don't
want
to
encourage
abductions.
on
the
other
hand,
we
don't
want
to
treat
the
child
as
a
yo-yo.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
question
is
whether
the
custody
hearing
will
be
in
a
family
court
in
britain
or
whether
it'll
be
in
a
family
court
in
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
correct
question;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
our
issue
about
whether
there's
discretion
or
--
it's
a
little
bit
secondary
because
we
can
have
a
big,
full-blown
hearing
about
who
should
have
custody,
though,
it
will
be
in
a
different
court.
it's
true.
you
lose.
there
is
more
incentive
to
kidnap
the
child.
it's
also
true
if
you
win,
there
is
a
much
greater
likelihood
that
the
custody
hearing
will
be
in
britain
rather
that
the
united
states,
which
is
the
yo-yo
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
go
--
now
say
what
you
want
to
say.
now,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
