justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
equitable
discretion
or
is
that
still
equitable
tolling?
because
as
i
understand
equitable
tolling,
if
it
applies,
and
say,
there's
a
6-month
suspension,
the
child
must
go
back
so
that
there's
--
so
that
the
--
that
the
weighing
that
you're
talking
about
just
doesn't
--
doesn't
come
into
play.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
it
does
provide
--
just
while
people
are
looking
at
it,
it
does
provide
that,
even
though
there's
in
your
view
equitable
tolling,
there
are
still
circumstances
in
which
the
child
would
not
go
back
if
there's
a
grave
--
grave
risk?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
grave
risk
of
harm
to
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
again,
as
justice
ginsburg
questions,
it
seems
to
me
indicates,
there
are
two
different
axes
here.
one
is
the
best
interest
of
the
child
and
the
other
is
an
adequate
deterrent
so
that
parents
don't
abduct.
but
those
axes
don't
cross
very
often,
if
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
still
--
but
article
13
still
is
different
from
what's
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
it's
true
that
all
we're
talking
about
is
for
the
--
during
the
time
in
which
the
hearing
takes
place,
but
these
hearings
take
years
and
expert
witnesses
are
not
available
or
readily
available.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
court?
to
use
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
in
a
sense
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
not
an
automatic
--
it's
not
an
automatic
rule.
the
more
you
argue
that
section
13
is
applicable,
the
more
you're
watering
down
the
very
rigid
rule
that
you
want
in
order
to
say
that
there
has
to
be
deterrence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
many
cases
this
would
be
an
example.
the
cost
of
experts
to
testify
about
the
child's
adoption
or
adaption
or
settlement
in
new
york
would
be
very
substantial.
the
experts
who
had
examined
the
child,
the
experts
who
knew
about
the
school,
the
school's
officials
themselves,
would
all
have
to
go
to
england
to
testify.
is
that
a
factor
that
the
courts
consider,
or
is
that
not
--
not
relevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
settlement
is
a
code
word
for
saying
ease
of
producing
witnesses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
--
what's
the
--
an
example
of
where
a
settled
child
might
be
returned?
a
very
--
two
very
good
parents,
and
the
child
is
very
adaptable,
and
so
the
child
can
--
is
well
settled
now,
but
the
child
will
be
well
settled
in
the
new
environment
at
well.
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
--
how
separate
are
the
two
concepts
of
the
well
best
interest
of
the
child
and
the
interest
in
policing
parents
so
they
don't
abduct?
at
what
point
do
they
intersect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
child
settled,
that's
when
the
abduction
took
place.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
it
started
that
a
settled
child
should
be
returned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
abducted.
