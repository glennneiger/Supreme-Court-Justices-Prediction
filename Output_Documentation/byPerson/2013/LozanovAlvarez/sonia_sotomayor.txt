justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
that's
turning
legislative
history
in
my
mind
on
its
head.
they
considered
directly,
if
you
study
the
sg's
brief,
a
discovery
rule
that
would
have
codified
equitable
tolling.
and
there
was
lengthy
discussion
about
it
and
a
decision
that
they
wouldn't
do
that,
that
instead
they
would
expand
the
period
to
a
year
where
automatic
return
was
required,
and
they
introduced
the
best
interest
of
the
child
after
that
year,
and
that
that
was
now
a
balancing
of
all
interests,
the
parents'
and
the
child's.
and
you're
right,
they
had
other
provisions
that
would
affect
the
possible
return
or
lack
thereof,
and
they
never
wanted
to
stop
a
court
from
returning
a
child
if
it
in
its
equitable
discretion
decided
it
was
appropriate.
but
you're
turning
that
legislative
history
on
its
head
a
little
bit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
don't
use
up
your
time.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
fairness--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--my
gosh,
all
it
takes
it
moving
to
peoria.
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
peoria,
but
all
it
takes
is
moving
to
a
place
that
has
no
connection
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--yes,
obviously.
[laughter]
obviously.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
do
have
a
point
--
a
question
though.
what
sense
does
this
make
when
--
that
a
child
who
--
a
suit
is
filed
within
the
year,
but
the
litigation
takes
2
or
the
child
who
--
the
filing
is
a
day
after
the
year,
and
the
litigation
takes
a
year
and
they're
both
in
the
same
situation.
why
should
those
two
children
be
treated
differently?
why
should
one
have
the
benefit
of
settled
now
and
the
other
not
have
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
sense
does
it
make
when,
as
justice
alito
indicated,
part
of
the
central
purposes
of
the
convention
is
to
avoid
the
kidnapping
of
children?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
article
13
enough
protection?
it
has
to
do
with
--
and
unlike
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it's
psychological
or
physical
harm
necessarily
by
the
parent,
but
by
the
situation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
return.
you
agree
with
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
they
relied
on
article
18,
didn't
they?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
one
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
whatever
fears
my
colleagues
have,
i've
only
found
two,
or
i
should
say
my
clerks
have
only
found
two,
published
decisions
in
which
courts
have
returned
the
child.
so
it's
not
as
if
they
are
ignoring
the
settlement
issue.
in
fact,
some
might
say
that
they
are
not
giving
abduction
enough
weight
in
--
in
enough
cases.
but
i
--
the
hong
kong
court
who
said
there
might
not
be
discretion
to
return
a
settled
child
was
not
the
highest
court
of
hong
kong,
either.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
if
we're
going
to
give
uniform
meaning,
the
uniform
meaning
of
international
weight
is
that
abduction
is
one
factor
for
a
court
to
consider
in
its
equitable
weighing
on
settlement,
because
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
convention.
that's
a
central
reason
in
the
preamble.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
isn't
there--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is,
in
fact,
the
central
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
huge
one,
whether
the
court
can--
