justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
excuse
me.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
suppose
a
child
is
abducted
at
--
at
age
one
and
is
concealed
for
10
years
and
then
the
location
of
the
child
is
discovered.
the
other
parent
files
a
petition.
so
that
if
there's
equitable
tolling,
the
petition
was
filed
within
one
year.
but
during
those
10
years,
the
child
has
become
very
well
settled
in
the
new
country,
has
learned
the
language
of
that
country,
the
customs
developed,
gone
to
school,
developed
relationships,
and
so
forth.
under
--
if
there
is
no
equitable
tolling
but
the
abduction
can
be
taken
into
account
under
the
doctrine
of
equitable
discretion,
that's
--
that's
one
thing.
but
the
way
you
read
this,
the
way
you
read
the
convention,
the
equitable
tolling
would
mean
that
the
petition
was
filed
within
a
year,
and
unless
one
of
the
conditions
in
article
13
was
met,
for
example
a
grave
risk
that
the
child's
return
would
expose
the
child
to
physical
or
psychological
harm
or
otherwise
place
the
child
in
an
intolerable
situation,
then
there
would
be
--
then
the
child
would
have
to
be
removed.
so
there
is
that
major
difference,
isn't
there,
between
those
two
positions?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
the
position
of
the
respondent
and
the
government
would
give
a
great
incentive
for
parents
to
abduct
children
and
hide
them
for
a
period
of
time.
but
on
the
other
side,
as
my
example
i
think
illustrates,
your
rule
would
mean
that
a
child
who
is
very
well
settled
in
a
particular
location
would
have
to
be
returned
to
the
other
country
for
purposes
of
the
custody
determination.
so
why
do
you
think
the
convention
should
be
read
one
way
rather
than
the
other?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
would
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
--
what
troubles
me
about
your
position
is
that
it
undermines
the
best
interests
of
children
in
a
very
powerful
way
insofar
as
it
does
not
deter,
and
indeed
encourages,
provides
a
great
incentive
for
parents
to
abduct
their
children.
and
that
was
the
central
purpose
of
the
convention,
to
prevent
harm
to
children
and
also
to
parents,
but
centrally
to
children
who
are
abducted.
and
if
you
have
a
rule
that
says
if
can
abduct
the
child
and
you
can
hide
for
a
year,
which
isn't
very
difficult,
then
all
you
have
to
do
is
provide
some
evidence
of
settlement,
and
you
are
going
to
--
you
are
going
to
win,
you
are
going
to
deter
return.
am
i
wrong
to
be
concerned
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
all
right.
perhaps
that's
the
solution
to
the
problem
then.
i
wonder
if
you
would
accept
that,
that
there
is
no
equitable
tolling,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
but
abduction
is
a
strong
factor
that
weighs
against
the
return,
that
weighs
against
the
failure
to
return
the
child,
not
just
something
that
can
be
disposed
of
in
a
sentence,
which
is
basically
what
the
district
court
did
here,
but
a
very
strong
factor
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
exercise
of
equitable
discretion.
would
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
--
you're
confusing
me.
let's
say
i'm
the
judge
who
has
to
decide
this.
the
one-year
period
has
just
past
and
i
have
evidence
that
this
child
who
is
now
two
years
old
has
some
friends,
goes
to
play
with
the
friends,
goes
to
the
park,
has
become
accustomed
to
some
american
customs,
knows
the
neighborhood.
so
the
child
is
settled
to
that
degree.
and
you
say
even
if
there's
been
very
elaborate
--
a
very
elaborate
effort
of
concealment,
no
proffered
justification
for
the
abduction,
no
indication
that
there
would
be
any
serious
harm
if
the
child
were
sent
back
to
the
u.k.,
you
say
that's
just
too
bad.
that's
your
answer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
sense
--
i
don't
know
what
sense
that
makes.
let's
say
a
child
is
abducted
in
mexico
and
let's
say
that
the
parent
who
is
left
behind
is
not
a
rich
or
sophisticated
person,
and
now
the
child
is
brought
to
the
united
states.
and
the
parent
in
mexico
has
a
year
to
find
the
child
in
the
united
states.
doesn't
speak
english.
can't
easily
find
a
lawyer
to
handle
the
case.
he's
got
an
enormous
country
to
try
to
find
the
child
in
the
united
states.
how
in
the
world
is
that
going
to
be
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
need
to
do
very
much
concealment.
you
can
go
to
peoria.
you
can
go
to
new
york
city,
and
--
and
it's
going
to
be
an
enormous
struggle
to
find
that
child
within
a
year.
