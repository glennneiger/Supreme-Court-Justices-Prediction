justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-820,
lozano
v.
alvarez.
mr.
regan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
moskowitz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
--
whether
or
not
the
child
is
settled
in
a
particular
case
is
certainly
going
to
be
a
significant
consideration
in
the
custody
determination,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem
is
you're
each
--
you're
each
using
the
child
as
the
tool
in
the
objective
that
you
have
in
representing
the
parents.
on
the
one
side
is
the
allegation
of
inequitable
conduct
in
concealment.
on
the
other
side
is
the
interest
in
settlement.
that's
a
dispute
between
two
parents,
and
the
child
is
being
used
as
--
as
--
i
don't
know
what
--
you
know,
a
tool
in
implementing
those
conflicting
considerations.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
convention
was
designed
to
deter
that
kind
of
kidnapping,
it
adopted
a
--
a
fairly
strict
rule.
and
you're
each
trying
to
say,
oh,
the
rule
doesn't
mean
what
it
means,
because
don't
worry,
we'll
take
those
considerations
into
account
in
addressing
custody;
and
on
the
other
side,
well,
don't
worry
because
there's
not
that
much
difference
between
12
and
13.
so
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
between
those
two
conflicting
considerations
of
the
parents
while
maintaining
the
paramount
concern,
certainly
not
the
exclusive
one
but
the
significant
one,
in
the
interest
of
the
child.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
cuts
against
you
in
some
respects.
you
say
there
is
such
a
big
difference
and
therefore
it
is
very
important
that
the
kidnapping
parent
do
the
best
he
or
she
can
to
conceal
the
child's
presence
so
they
get
beyond
13
and
into
12.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
those
are
us
from
the
midwest
think
it's
actually
easier
to
hide
a
child
in
new
york.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
unusual
for
a
family
court
in
that
situation
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
custody
proceeding
before
it,
because
it
would
think
the
child
is
settled.
now,
do
i
send
the
child
back
so
that
they
can
do
the
custody
proceeding
in
england,
or
just
go
ahead
and
do
it
here?
don't
you
think
most
family
court
judges
would
say
let's
just
go
ahead
and
do
it
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
kind
of
reasons,
what
kind
of
reasons
would
there
--
would
there
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
send
the
child
back?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
visit
on
the
child
the
behavior
of
the
parent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
regan,
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
