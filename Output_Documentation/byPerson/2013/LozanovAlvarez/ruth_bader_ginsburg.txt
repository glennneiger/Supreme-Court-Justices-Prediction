mr.
--
mr.
regan,
you
--
you
want
us
to
apply
equitable
tolling
in
a
field,
family
law,
where
the
interest
of
the
child
is
always
of
paramount
importance
and
running
all
through
family
law
is
--
is
that
concern.
and
changed
circumstances
figure
very
large.
so
decrees
that
might
be
final
in
another
area
of
law
are
not,
because
if
circumstances
change,
then
the
child
custody
may
change.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
area
is
hugely
unfit
for
equitable
tolling
that
would
leave
out
consideration
of
the
child's
best
interests.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
article
13
so
we
can
look
at
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
regan,
aside
from
the
position
of
the
united
states,
which
--
which
has
changed,
you
made
that
point,
the
determination
that's
being
made
at
this
stage
is
really
one
of
venue.
it's
where
the
main
bout
will
be
fought
out.
and
so
we
don't
want
that
to
linger
for
a
long
time.
we
want
that
decision
to
be
made
with
dispatch.
and
as
one
of
the
amici
brief
informs
us,
many
of
these
what
you
call
kidnappers
happen
to
be
badly
abused
women
and
if
you
--
if
they
had
to
go
under
article
13,
then
they
would
have
this
full-blown,
was
he
really
the
abuser?
doing
it
without
equitable
tolling,
that
question
is
reserved
for
the
main
--
for
the
main
bout.
i
suppose
if
we
had
a
case
where
the
judge
isn't
certain
was
the
father
abuser
or
not,
that
judge
would
feel
an
obligation
to
stretch
out
this
venue
determination
to
see
if
it's
an
article
13
situation.
justice
ruth
bader

may
i
--
may
i
ask
you,
i
think
your
brief
--
i
may
not
be
remembering
it
correctly,
but
i
think
you
--
you
said
no
equitable
tolling,
and
everybody
in
all
the
other
countries
agree
on
that.
but
there
is
equitable
discretion.
i
think
that
you
--
and
the
question
is,
is
there
this
equitable
discretion
notion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
how
would
that
be
aid
be
invoked?
take
justice
scalia's
example.
the
parent
left
behind
in
mexico,
no
resources
of
her
own
or
his
own.
how
would
the
state
department
get
into
the
act?
