mr.
massey,
with
respect
to
that,
there
is
a
claim
for
restitution.
i
take
it
if
the
suit
is
successful,
the
money
that's
collected
will
be
distributed
to
all
the
people
who
are
affected
by
this
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
massey,
you
envision
one
proceeding,
it
could
be
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
the
individuals,
that
doesn't
require
everybody
tot
satisfy
the
amount
in
controversy,
and
then
this
action
by
the
attorney
general,
which
does,
among
other
things,
seek
restitution.
isn't
there
an
overlap
between
those
two
claims,
and
how
do
we
sort
out
--
you
said
--
at
one
point
i
think
you
described
the
restitution
as
“
disgorgement
of
ill
gotten
gains
”.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
we
have
the
consumers
who
were
affected,
they've
already
been
paid.
so
how
does
it
work
for
the
attorney
general's
suit?
what
is
the
impact
of
the
class
action
that
has
already
gone
forward
and
been
completed
on
the
attorney
general's
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
we
know
that's
not
true
in
this
case
because
we
already
have
a
settled--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
your
--
is
your
view
of
what's
called
the
mass
action
--
a
mass
action
is
you
have
to
have
a
sizeable
number
of
plaintiffs,
each
one
with
75
--
at
least
$75,000
at
stake.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
so
they
would
all
be
named
plaintiffs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
many
actions
of
that
nature
where
there
are
hundreds
of
people
each
with
a
claim
of
75,000
or
more?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
bring
such
a
claim
in
federal
courts
in
this
mass
action
formula?
i
can
see
in
mississippi
doesn't
have
class
actions,
but
if
you're
in
federal
court,
why
would
you
ever
have
a
mass
action
instead
of
a
class
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
particular
case,
the
individual
claims
were
settled
in
the
class
action,
so
if
there
--
if
there
are
no
individual
claimants
to
be
--
to
be
represented,
why
doesn't
this
end
up
being
a
claim
where
only
the
state
of
mississippi
has
a
stake,
because
the
individuals
that
the
state
might
have
been
representing
have
already
been
satisfied,
so
if
this
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
seems
to
be
--
that
seems
to
be
disputed,
because
i
understood
mr.
massey
to
say
that
the
restitution
claim
would
go
to
the
state.
and
you
say
that
that
--
the
restitution
couldn't
go
to
the
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
they
didn't,
but
if
you
look
at
the
committee
report,
what
is
the
definition
of
mass
action?
and
it
is,
under
this
new
subsection
d-11,
"expands
jurisdiction
over
suits
that
are
brought
on
behalf
of
numerous
--
numerous
--
named
plaintiffs.
"
“
numerous
named
plaintiffs
”.
