scalia
what
are
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
attorney
general
says
that
that's
not
what's
going
to
happen
here.
how
do
you
square
that
with
his
statement
that
that
money
will
not
get
to
these
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
you
can't
--
he
says
you
can't
even
identify
those
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
do
you
do
about
this
--
this
language
in
the
definition?
i
haven't
heard
you
explain
it.
it
--
it
says
--
it
means
any
--
mass
action
means
"any
civil
action
in
which
monetary
relief
claims
of
100
or
more
persons
are
proposed
to
be
tried
jointly
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs'
claims
involve
common
questions
of
law
or
fact.
"
now,
they're
not
proposed
to
be
tried
jointly
here
on
that
ground.
they're
being
tried
jointly
on
the
ground
that
the
suit
is
being
brought
by
the
attorney
general
under
this
state
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes,
congress
doesn't
do
it
right,
you
know?
[laughter]
sometimes,
they
try
to
catch
everything,
but
the
language
they
use
doesn't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it's
contrived
legislative
history?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
did
not
the
fifth
circuit
decide
that
state
law
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
i
understood
the
fifth
circuit
to
have
held.
