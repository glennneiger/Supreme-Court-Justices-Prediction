mr.
christopher
m.
curran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
the
mass
action
definition
requires
this
court
to
conclude
that
a
mass
action
can
only
be
one
of
the
actions
with
100
or
more
named
plaintiffs,
and
can
never
be
a
representative
action.
that
interpretation
cannot
be
squared
with
the
statutory
language,
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
structure
of
the
act.
justice
kagan,
you
referred
to
the
general
public
provision.
that
provision
expressly
refers
to
the
possibility
of
a
representative
action.
in
the
parenthetical
language
in
that
provision,
and,
you
know,
i
look
at
it
on
the
--
in
the
act
form
on
66a,
but
it's,
of
course,
in
the
codification
as
well
on
page
79a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
the
parenthetical
there
says
that
--
that
this
exclusion
does
not
apply
in
cases
where
the
action
is
not
on
behalf
of
individual
claimants
or
members
of
a
purported
class.
so
in
other
words,
this
exclusion
under
the
mass
action
definition
is
contemplating
a
situation
where
there
are
individual
claimants
or
members
of
a
purported
class.
that
--
that
has
to
be
beyond
the
named
plaintiff.
in
another
example,
farther
down
in
the
exceptions
to
the
mass
action
definition,
there's
a
reference
to
section
1407,
which
is
the
mdl
transfer
provision.
there
again,
there's
reference
to
the
possibility
of
a
mass
action
being
converted
into
a
rule
23
class
action.
those
provisions
don't
make
sense
unless
it's
possible
for
a
mass
action
to
be
a
representative
action.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well
--
well,
a
couple
of
things.
number
one,
it
--
it
may
well
be
that
the
mass
action
definition,
a
use
of
persons,
that,
of
course,
our
position
is
that
is
unnamed.
those
are
real
parties
in
interest
of
the
claims.
the
reference
to
plaintiffs
may
well
be,
as
the
attorney
general
posits,
the
named
plaintiffs.
so
the
$75,000
requirement,
and
justice
ginsburg
referred
to
this
--
this
as
well,
that
--
that
can
make
perfect
sense.
it's
--
it's
a
way
to
make
sure
that
the
named
plaintiffs,
who,
after
all,
are
being
given
the
keys
to
federal
discovery
and
maybe
the
ability
to
negotiate
settlements,
that
they've
got
some
skin
in
the
game,
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
named
plaintiffs
controlling
the
litigation,
have
75,000
or
more
at
stake.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--your
honor,
i
see
similarities
between
this
provision
and
the
pslra,
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act,
that
reformed
class
actions
in
the
securities
context.
and
there,
there
was
--
there
were
provisions
requiring
that
the
named
plaintiff
be
a
prominent
victim
of
the
alleged
fraud.
and
--
and
here,
i
think
it's
got
a
similar
idea,
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
named
plaintiffs
have
that
kind
of
stake.
and
this
is
an
important
point,
because
i
think
there's
been
some
suggestion
that
this
is
unwieldy
or
does
it
make
sense
if
all
the
claimants
under
75,000
get
remanded.
but
recall
this
court's
jurisprudence
on
supplemental
jurisdiction.
allapattah
allows
for
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
certain
plaintiffs
do
not
satisfy
the
jurisdictional
minimum.
as
long
as
there
are
some
that
do,
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
allow
those
that
don't
to
stay
in
the
same
action.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
i
mean,
i
don't
see--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well,
i
don't
understand
that,
because
section
1367
says
supplemental
jurisdiction
shall
exist
unless
it's
expressly
provided
otherwise
in
a
federal
statute.
and
this
court
interpreting
similar
language
in
the
breuer
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
papers,
said
“
expressly
”
means
it's
got
to
be
direct,
it's
got
to
be
explicit,
it
has
to
be
inescapable.
so
i
would
submit
that
this
language
about
the
75,000,
that
does
not
preclude
supplemental
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
i
think
that
--
that
argument
is
foreclosed
by
breuer.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
there
are
--
there
are
a
couple
of
aspects
to
this.
first
of
all,
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
the
mississippi
statute
requires
that
the
money
goes
to
the
mississippi
citizens,
and
that
the
attorney
general
here
is
basically
suing
as
a
representative
or
a
conduit
for
those
citizens.
the
fact
that
those
citizens,
many
of
those
citizens,
not
all
of
them,
the
fact
that
many
of
them
have
settled
and
have
resolved
the
claims
in
the
multidistrict
litigation,
that
means
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
fight
in
one
court
or
another
--
we
think
it
should
be
in
a
federal
court;
the
attorney
general
thinks
the
state
court
--
over
what
the
preclusive
effects
are
of
that
prior
settlement.
we
view
this
case
as
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
double
dip.
it's
the
same--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--that
is
under
federal
law.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
the
ipt
case,
that
was
a
state
law
case
in
federal
court.
okay.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
yes.
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
that
was
in
federal
court,
but
it
was
asserting
state
claims.
that's
included--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--the
named
plaintiff.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
because
we
are
not
disputing
that
the
attorney
general
has
standing
to
bring
a
claim
as
a
nominee
for
the
real
parties
in
interest.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
because
the
statutory
language
says
if
it's
a
civil
action
with
monetary
relief
claims
--
we
clearly
got
that
--
of
100
or
more
persons,
we
think
those
claims
under
the
mississippi
statute
inescapably
belong
to
those
persons.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
i'm
getting
there.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
yes.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
they
filed
a
single
complaint,
right,
under
rule
42
and
--
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
state
analog
to
that,
and
pre-existing
jurisprudence.
when
you
file
a
single
complaint,
you're
asking
for
a
single
trial.
and
if
you
want
to
bifurcate
a
trial
of
some
kind,
you
have
to
make
a
motion.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
so
i
submit
there
is
a
proposed
--
a
proposal
to
try
these
claims
jointly.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
that
would
be
the
same
thing,
your
honor,
in
the
case
that
they
say
is
the
quintessential
mass
--
mass
action
case.
they
say
a
mass
action
case
is
one
where
a
bunch
of
plaintiffs
have
joined
together
in
a
single
suit--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--why?
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
no,
they--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--file
a
complaint.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
submit
that
when
a
state
attorney
general
files
a
complaint
on
behalf
of
100
or
more
persons
claiming
to
have
standing
and
to
be
seeking
to
recover
for
the
damages
to
those
100
or
more
persons,
he's
proposing
to
try
those
claims
together.
and
as
to
--
as
to
whose
claims
they
are,
i
mean,
the
mississippi
statute
is
pretty
clear
that
the
claim
for
restitution
is
--
is
necessary
to
restore
to
the
persons
in
interest,
the
victims.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
he
cited
the
statute
that
has
that
plain
language.
that
plain
language
was
interpreted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
there
are
--
it's
a
model
act
that's
been
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
courts
of
other
states,
iowa
and
arizona.
they
looked
at
that
language.
oh,
yeah,
the
money
goes
to
the
people.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
that
is
--
that
doesn't
hold
up.
obviously,
those
people
were
identified
in
the
class
action.
they're
getting
the
money
that's
being
distributed.
people
can
turn
in
receipts.
there
are
records.
every
antitrust
case
has
this
issue
identifying
the
victims
and
compensating
them.
it's
no
different
here.
and
another
thing.
there
was
a
suggestion
that,
oh,
everybody
in
the
world
has
lcd
panels,
that
the
period
of
time
at
issue
in
this
case
is
1996
to
2006.
lcd
panels,
which
we
now
take
for
granted
and
are
ubiquitous,
back
then
were
just
an
emerging
technology.
and
for
that
i
cite
to
the
attorney
general's
brief
at
page
--
their
complaint,
page
32a
of
our
cert
ap,
paragraph
104,
which
acknowledges
that
lcds
were
not
even
the
leading
technology
for
televisions
back
during
this
period
of
time.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
i
do.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
okay.
but
to
be
clear,
our
--
in
our
position,
the
only
basis
we
have
for
removal
here
is
the
inclusion
of
the
restitution
claim,
which
under
mississippi
law
says
that
the
claim
belongs
to
the
citizens
and
it's
their
money.
if
--
if
that
claim
wasn't
in
this
action--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--that's
right.
there
is
a
dispute
on
that
issue.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
we
don't
care
where
it
goes.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
the
mississippi
statute
is
clear.
the
attorney
general
cited
that.
the
case
law
is
clear
on
that.
so
--
and
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
mississippi
law
required
the
money
to
go
to
the
individuals.
i
think
this
court
should
defer
to
those
prior
rulings
of
--
of
those
courts.
and
--
so
basically,
that's
in
the
statutory
language.
and
by
the
way,
parens
patriae
is
such
a
loose
label
that's
thrown
around.
the
--
the
attorney
generals
seem
to
raise
that
up
as
a
latin
shield
of
some
kind,
suggesting
that
as
long
as
they
invoke
that
term,
that
issues
of
federalism
prevents
removal
or
something.
that
doesn't
hold
up.
the
statutory
language,
which
is
in
english,
says
that
specific
--
specific
cases
are
removable.
and
so
we
--
so
i
don't
think
we
should
--
i
don't
think
it's
productive
to
talk
about
whether
something
is
parens
patriae
or
not.
but,
justice
breyer,
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
can
be
brought
by
state
attorney
generals
that
would
not
be
mass
actions
like
this
case
without
the
restitution
claim.
okay?
also,
if
there's
a
big
pollution
problem
or
--
or
some
public
nuisance
or
some
other
thing
like
that
where
--
where
there's
no
identifiable
victims,
but
the
public
as
a
whole
is
injured,
that
--
that
probably
is
a
quasi-sovereign
claim.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
i
--
i
view
that
language
as
contemplating
a
rule
23
type
analysis.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
okay.
and
in
this
case,
we've
got
a
state
attorney
general
who's
suing
not
only
for
the
consumers,
but
also
for
himself,
right?
he's
got
propriety
claims
in
there.
he's
also
suing
on
--
for
all
the
counties
and
municipalities
in
mississippi.
i
think
a
basis
for
his
combination
of
those
claims
in
a
single
lawsuit
is
the
inescapable
commonality
of
fact
and
maybe
law
in
those
claims.
so
i
--
i
do
think
that
it
--
it
satisfies
that
language.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
i
think,
justice
kagan,
that
the
attorney
general
has
already
done
that.
i
think
that
his
complaint
beginning
on
the
first
page
says,
i'm
bringing
this
claim
on
behalf
of
purchases
by
the
state
and
by
its
citizens
of
these
lcd
panels,
and
it's
a
single
complaint.
so
i
think
--
i
think--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well,
i
guess
--
i
suppose
we
could
move
for
bifurcation
to
separate
the
--
the
proprietary
claims
from
the
claims
on
behalf
of
citizens
and
then
he
would
say,
no,
it
makes
sense
to
keep
them
all
together.
but
--
but
the
--
the
sequencing
of
those
arguments,
i
don't
think
should
be
dispositive
here.
by
filing
a
complaint,
again,
i
invoke
rule
--
rule
42
of
the
code
of
federal
civil
procedure.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
certainly,
he
--
he
at
least
is
attempting
to
combine
the
claims
of
all
the
various
individuals
in
the
state
on
the
grounds
of
commonality,
right?
i
mean,
even
if
you
separate
his
claims
out,
i
mean,
it's
reason
is--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well,
certainly,
it's
--
it's
a
mass
action
in
that
circumstance.
because
restitution
under
mississippi
law
is
for
those
specified
individuals.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
well,
then,
again,
the
statutory
language
says
if
it's
a
civil
action--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well,
it's
at
the
beginning
of
the
mass
action
definition.
you
can
look
at
it
on
either
65(a)
and
66(a)
or
79(a).
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
okay.
79(a)
"mass
action
means
any
civil
action
in
which
monetary
relief
claim
of
100
or
more
persons.
"
so
as
long
as
you've
got
a
qualifying
claim,
then
the
civil
action's
removable.
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
there
are
additional
claims
or
extraneous
claims.
so
the
--
the
claim
here
for
restitution
on
behalf
of
mississippi
citizens
is
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
make
this
a
mass
action.
and,
again
--
and,
justice
kagan,
maybe
this
is
getting
back
to
--
to
your
point.
i
referred
to
the
references
to
representative
actions
in
the
--
in
the
general
public
provision
and
in
the
1407
provision
that
inescapably
mean
that
--
that
this
provision
can
apply
to
representative
actions.
maybe
that
doesn't
satisfy
your
commonality
point,
but
--
but
it
gets
part
of
the
way
there.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
if
that's
all
this
statute
was
meant
to
reach,
that
would
have
been
such
an
easy
statute
to
write.
instead
of
this
more
convoluted
language,
it
could
have
just
said
if
it's
a
civil
action
in
which
100
or
more
named
plaintiffs
are
asserting
monetary
relief
claims
for
joint--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--well,
how
--
well,
first
of
all,
how
do
you
explain
--
i
don't
mean
to
pose
a
question
to
you
--
it's
inexplicable
that
the
word
“
persons
”--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--it's
--
it's
inexplicable
that
congress
would
use
the
word
“
persons
”
and
then
12
words
later
use
“
plaintiffs
”
if
it
signifies
the
exact
same
thing,
and
then
continue
to
use
the
term
“
plaintiffs
”
throughout.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
no.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
there's
another
provision
in
here
that
is
incorporated
into
the
mass
action.
you
will
recall
that
if
something
qualifies
as
a
mass
action
then
the
provisions
dealing
with
class
actions
apply
as
well.
and
sub-part
8,
which
is
found
at
the
bottom
of
77a,
specifically
says:
"this
subsection
shall
apply
to
any
class
action
before
or
after
the
entry
of
a
class
certification
order
by
the
court
with
respect
to
that
action.
"
so
it's
--
what
this
statute
is
addressing
is
possible
class
actions.
and
in
fact,
i
think
--
i
think
it
makes
sense
to
view
this
--
this
statutory
question
in
light
of
the
overriding
statutory
purpose
here.
and,
justice
breyer,
you
address
this
in
your
opinion
in
standard
fire.
the
driving
force
behind
this
statute
was
to
put
interstate
claims
of
national
importance
into
federal
court,
to
provide
the
option
of
a
federal
forum.
and
in
that
case,
in
standard
fire,
this
court
unanimously
examined
the
statutory
question
there
through
that
lens.
here
--
so
congress
dealt
with
class
actions
proper,
if
you
will,
under
rule
23,
in
the
class
action
section.
and
then
it's
got
the
mass
action
section,
which
is
inescapably
designed
to
catch
other
devices
that
have
the
same
problems.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
but
here,
i
think
it
does
do
it.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
and
if
there
are
competing
interpretations,
then
that
purpose
should
drive
the
decision.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
and
they
failed.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
no,
no,
no,
no.
no.
they
made
their
proposal
to
--
to
modify
the
statute
after
the
act
was
in
this
form.
they
saw
the
act
in
this
form
--
and
including
attorney
general
hood
sent
a
letter
to
congress
saying
this
is
going
to
infringe
upon
our
rights
to
parens
patriae
cases.
that
amendment
sponsored
by
senator
pryor
failed.
so
i
think
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
that
is
that
attorney
general
hood
and
many
of
his
counterparts
in
other
states
saw
this
problem,
saw
this
threat.
now,
a
response
that
some
on
the
senate
floor
gave
to
that
proposal
was:
it's
not
really
necessary.
but
the
reason
it
was
not
really
necessary
is
because
the
bona
fide
interests
of
the
state
were
already
protected,
through
the
local
controversy
rule
and
through
the
general
public
exception.
congress
did
not
intend
for
state
attorneys
general
to
be
able
to
use
their
offices
to
hire
outside
counsel,
out-of-state
outside
counsel,
to
copycat
a
class
action
complaint
from
an
mdl,
bring
it
again--
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
--yes,
i
am
familiar
with
that
sentence
in
that
senate
report.
i
am
also
aware
that
that
senate
report
was
issued
and
dated
a
week
or
ten
days
after
senate
--
after
president
bush
signed
this
act.
so
i
question
its
value
and
its
credibility.
mr.
christopher
m.
curran
but
--
but
even
if
it
somehow
could
be
considered,
i
don't
think
that
--
that
sentence
is
definitional.
that
certainly
is
one
alternative
to
--
to
conventional
class
actions
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
our
point
is
it
wasn't
the
only
one.
congress
was
trying
to
close
loopholes
and
trying
to
prevent
abuses
and
a
miserly
interpretation
of
the
class
--
of
the
mass
action
definition
would
undermine
that
--
that
purpose.
now,
in
my
remaining
time
perhaps,
justice
kagan,
at
the
end
of
the
day
there
was
no
carve-out
in
the
statute
for
attorney
general
actions,
even
though
that
was
sought.
but
the
act
does
reflect
some
sensitivity
for
federalism
concerns.
it's
got
an
exception
for
situations
where
states
are
the
primary
defendants,
or
state
officials
are
the
primary
defendants.
there
is
also
a
notification
to
state
attorneys
general
when
there's
a
settlement
of
a
class
action.
those
kinds
of
provisions
show
that
congress
was
trying
to
be
sensitive
and
it
was
horse
trading,
it
was
cutting
deals,
it
was
log
rolling,
coming
up
with
an
act
here
that
was
at
once
sensitive
to
federalism
concerns,
but
also
trying
to
solve
the
very
real
abuses
that
it
had
identified.
and
on
the
federalism
point,
the
attorney
general's
brief
has
a
lot
of
citations
to
eleventh
amendment
issues,
and
some
of
this
court's
precedents
dealing
with
state
sovereign
immunity.
i
submit
that
those
precedents
and
that
amendment
deal
only
with
situations
where
the
state
is
a
defendant.
and
here,
where
we
are
talking
about
the
state
as
a
plaintiff,
and
the
only
intrusion
we
are
talking
about
is
removal
from
state
court
to
federal
court,
that
is
not
on
the
same
playing
field
as
the
authorities
relied
on
by
the
attorney
general.
a
couple
of
other
things.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
complaint
here
was
not
in
fact
a
copycat
case,
a
copycat
complaint,
but
instead
was
a
summary
of
the
federal
indictments,
and
that
that
explains
the
eerie
similarity
between
the
class
action
complaint
and
the
attorney
general's
complaint.
that's
just
factually
not
right.
some
companies
who
were
defendants,
like
my
client,
toshiba,
was
never
charged
or
convicted
of
anything
in
this
case,
yet
we're
a
defendant
in
this
case,
and
that's
because
we
were
a
defendant
in
the
class
action
case
that
was
copied.
and
in
fact,
the
indictments
against
some
companies
bear
very
little
resemblance
to
the
complaint
that
the
attorney
general
has
filed
here
in
terms
of
the
duration
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
products
that
are
alleged
--
were
allegedly
price-fixed.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
thank
you.
