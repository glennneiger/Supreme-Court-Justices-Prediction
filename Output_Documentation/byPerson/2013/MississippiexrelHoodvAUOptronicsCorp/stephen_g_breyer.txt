justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
tell
me
when
you
come
back
where
the
money
goes
if
you
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
that?
i
thought
that
in
a
--
maybe
it's
changed
since
i
knew
the
law
in
this
area.
but
i
thought
because
of
illinois
brick
the
ultimate
consumers
couldn't
recover,
but
there
--
you
have
to
be
a
direct
purchaser
rather
than
an
indirect
purchaser
of
the
price-fixed
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
all
right.
so
this
is
a
state
law
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
your
case
is,
but
the
one
that
settled
previously?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
have
a
double
dip
claim.
i
guess
my
question
procedurally
is
that
here
the
state
of
mississippi
is
the
named
plaintiff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
moreover,
the
state
of
mississippi
is
suing
in
order
to
obtain
money,
is
what
we
just
heard,
for
its
treasury.
and
third,
the
state
of
mississippi
is
suing
because
of
their
belief
that
the
defendants
injured
the
economy
of
mississippi
and
they
injured
it
by
hurting
the
pocketbooks
of
many
individuals
in
mississippi,
the
names
of
whom
they
don't
even
know.
all
right?
now,
they
say,
look
at
--
read
the
statute.
read
the
cases
which
say
if
you
are
a
nominal
plaintiff,
that's
good
enough
as
long
as
you
are
not
suing
as
some
kind
of
--
i
forget
the
words
--
quasi-sovereign,
whatever
it
was,
one
way
or
the
other.
you
know
the
cases
better
than
i.
but
why
isn't
what
they
just
said
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that,
but
why
does
that
fall
within
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
see,
i
can
understand
a
complaint
where
they
have
taken
100
individuals
or
102,
and
they
list
them
as
plaintiffs,
and
they
don't
call
it
a
class
action.
and
that
would
fall
right
within
the
meaning
of
mass
action
if
the
numbers
are
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we
take
your
approach
and
depart
from
that
mechanical,
but
simple
--
simply
administered
interpretation,
what
was
worrying
me,
and
perhaps
you
can
help
me
with
that,
is
that
there
are
perhaps
all
kinds
of
state
actions
where
one
of
the
motivating
reasons
is
behind
the
lawsuit
is
some
person
hurt
our
citizens.
and
so
now
we
will
get
into
the
instantly
interesting,
but
very
difficult
question
of
well,
when
you
say
hurt
your
citizens,
do
you
mean
hurt
them
by
giving
them
rise
to
an
independent
cause
of
action
for
each
of
them,
who
we
don't
know
who
they
are
and
we
don't
know
if
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
to
some,
and
we
don't
know
if
others
have
other
disabilities;
but,
nonetheless,
we're
not
certain
this
suit
is
entirely
for
that.
it
may
be
mixed
up
with
other
things.
do
you
see
the
problem
once
i
start
down
your
road?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
departed
from
the
clear
and
simple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
hold
him
to
that,
and
i
guess
he
can
say,
no,
i
don't
want
to
be
held
to
that
or
--
but
that
seemed
to
be
not
for
this
court.
once
he
says
it,
i
guess--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
can
we
not
take
him
at
his
word?
he
said
it
wasn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
says
is
--
in
the
complaint,
it
says
--
"prays
that
the
defendant
be
ordered
to
restitute
any
and
all
moneys
for
the
purchases
of
its
citizens.
"
all
right.
now,
you
look
at
the
statute
he
quoted,
the
mississippi
statute,
and
it
says
there
is
the
authority
to
have
restitution
to
restore
to
any
person
in
interest
any
moneys
which
may
have
been
acquired
by
means
of
a
practice
prohibited.
so
he
says
that
sounds
as
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
you
want
restitution,
though,
given
to
the
state,
the
restitution
is
for
individual
purchases
of
individual
citizens,
because
there
could
be
no
other.
and,
therefore,
you
have
a
list
of
people
in
mind,
or
you
must
find
one,
where
there
were
particular
individual
purchases
by
individual
citizens
and
get
that
restitution
into
the
treasury.
now,
that
--
i
think
something
like
that
was
his
argument,
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
you
were
going
to
say.
are
you
going
to
give
up
these
last
five
words,
"and
the
purchases
of
its
citizens?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
the
purchases
of
its
citizens.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
they'll
get
the
money--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
he's
saying
to
get
the
money,
you
have
to
say
which
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
to
get
the
money,
which
money
means
you
better
have
a
list
of
the
individual
people
who
bought
something,
or
otherwise,
there
is
no
such
money,
and
that's
enough
to
make
those
in
respect
to
this
paragraph,
individual
people
whose
claims
the
state
of
mississippi
is
pursuing.
something
like
that
is
his
argument.
and
i
just
wanted
to
know
your
response.
