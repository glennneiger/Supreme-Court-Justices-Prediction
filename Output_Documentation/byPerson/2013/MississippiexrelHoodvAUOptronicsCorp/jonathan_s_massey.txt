mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
and
structure
of
the
class
action
fairness
act
of
2005,
which
is
known
as
cafa,
show
that
it
does
not
extend
to
state
parens
patriae
actions.
if
there
are
any
doubt
on
the
matter,
cafa
would
have
to
be
narrowly
construed
as
a
matter
of
the
principles
of
federalism
that
are
at
issue
here,
as
evidenced
by
the
46
states
supporting
mississippi
before
the
court.
the
disposition
of
the
case
today,
we
believe,
is
straightforward.
there
is
only
one
plaintiff
in
this
case,
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
is
not
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
therefore,
the
requirements
of
even
minimal
diversity,
let
alone
the
100-person
numerosity
requirement
of
cafa,
cannot
be
met.
our
friends
on
the
other
side
want
to
use
the
statute
of
cafa
to
change
that
result.
the
mass
action
definition
is
the
key
part
of
the
statute
issued
today.
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
79
to
80.
essentially,
the
attempt
to
force
state
actions
into
the
mass
action
definition
is
a
square-peg-round-hole
kind
of
problem.
the
mass
action
definition
addresses
the
situation
of
mass
consolidation
or
mass
joinder
when
there
are
100
individual
plaintiffs
or
more
in
a
case.
and
cafa
provides
that
there's
federal
jurisdiction
over
such
a
case.
but
that
does
not
apply
to
this
situation.
cafa
refers
to
real
plaintiffs
asserting
concrete
claims
and
further
provides
that
those
claims
must
be
proposed
to
be
tried
jointly.
none
of
that
happens
in
a
parens
patriae
case
where
the
state
is
the
only
plaintiff.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
very
unlikely
in
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
--
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
consumers
of
mississippi
have
already
sued
in
an
indirect
purchaser
action
that
has
been
settled.
so
they
have
received
compensation.
the
state
does
have
a
restitution
claim
here.
your
honor
is
correct.
and
at
page
65(a)
of
the
--
of
the
response
to
opposition
of
the
orange
briefs,
65(a)
describes
the
restitution
claim.
the
restitution
claim
seeks
recovery
to
the
state
of
the
money,
not
to
consumers
in
mississippi.
and
what's
likely
to
happen
here,
and
frankly
what
happens
very
frequently
when
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
or
any
other
state
or
agency
seeks
restitution,
the
money
is
recovered
by
the
state.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
where
it
is
very
difficult
to
trace
the
individuals,
the
consumers
who've
been
hurt
--
after
all,
we're
talking
to
lcd
price-fixing
conspiracy.
so
every
television,
computer
monitor,
phone,
toy,
digital
camera,
car
navigation
system,
there
are
no
records,
obviously,
of
who
purchased
them,
and
it
would
cost
so
much
money
to
identify
them.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
the
--
the
complaint
does
pray
that.
as
the
case
goes
forward,
the
attorney
general,
and
subject
to
all
the
procedures
that
occur
in
mississippi,
will
have
to
make
a
judgment
about
how
that
money
is
to
be
distributed.
in
the
past,
what
i
can
tell
you--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
our
argument
does
not
change.
i
would
say
in
our
case
the
state
--
just
to
be
clear
about
restitution
--
the
state
is
proceeding
under
statutes
that
gives
the
--
the
state
the
only
cause
of
action.
only
the
state
can
sue
under
these
provisions.
if
the
state
--
the
--
the
consumers
have
separate
damages
statutes.
the
consumers
would
sue
under
separate
statutes
in
a
different
court.
so
the
--
the
--
in
a
different
court,
meaning
in
mississippi,
that
would
have
to
be
in
a
circuit
court,
court
of
law
as
opposed
to
a
court
of
equity.
but
if
a
state
were
to
seek
restitution
and
to
distribute
it
to
consumers,
just
to
be
clear,
our
argument
would
not
change
because
restitution
is
still
a
public
remedy.
and
for
years,
for
decades
federal
agencies
and
states
have--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--it
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes,
named
plaintiffs.
the
--
the
simplest
resolution
of
the
case
is
simply
a
statutory
argument,
that
on
its
face,
the
mass
action
definition
refers
to
plaintiffs.
the
only
plaintiff
is
the
state.
even
if
the
state
has
statutory
authority
to
seek
restitution,
it
is
still
the
only
plaintiff.
so
you
would
not
even
need
to
get
into
the
real
party-in-interest
test,
because
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to
unnamed
parties
or
to
people
who
might
be
real
parties
in
interest.
it
refers
simply
to
the
plaintiffs.
so
it's
simple--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
reference
to
persons
in
the
mass
action
definition.
it
occurs
--
we
believe
very
strongly
that
it
equates,
that
--
that
section
continues
and
equates
persons
with
plaintiffs,
and
that
the
statute,
in
fact,
wouldn't
--
would
be
absurd
if
it
didn't,
because
it
refers
to
the
monetary
claims
of
100
or
more
persons,
as
your
honor
has
noted.
but
then
it
says:
"that
are
proposed
to
be
tried
jointly
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs'
claims
involve
common
questions
of
law
or
fact.
"
those
two
sets
have
to
mean
the
same
thing;
otherwise,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
and
furthermore,
there
are
severe
practical
problems
that
support
our
sort
of
square-peg-and-round-hole
problem.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
because
--
we
think
that
our
reading
is
better
because
if
you're
applying
the
common
question
test,
not
to
the
persons
who
were
in
the
case,
those
abstract
unnamed,
unknown
consumers,
you're
not
inquiring
as
to
what
their
claims
might
be,
you're
applying
the
common
question
test
only
to
the
plaintiff,
how
could
that
--
how
could
that
produce
an
administrable
result?
you
could
have
consumers
--
you
never
--
you
would
never
know
whether
they
presented
common
questions.
and
that
--
that
can't
be
what
congress
was
thinking
of,
because
then
you
would
have
a
license
for
an
unadministrable
--
this
is
clearly
a
reference
to
the
kind
of
rule
23
inquiry
where,
as
this
court
has
emphasized
in
class
action
case
after
class
action
case,
there
has
to
be
a
rigorous
analysis
to
ensure
that
there
are
actual
common
questions
based
on
the
--
the
actual
claims
asserted.
and
--
and
we
think
that
there's
--
that
any
other
reading
produces
confusion,
not
just
in
this
section,
but
also
in
the
remand
section,
the
$75,000
remand
section
of
the
statute.
cafa
provides
that
if
a
claim
does
not
make
--
does
not
reach
the
amount
in
controversy
requirement,
it
has
to
be
remanded
to
state
court.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that,
of
course,
is
a
different
case
when
it
is
not
involving
the
government.
but
we
think
navarro
would
essentially
address
that
situation.
that's
this
court's
decision
in
1980
that
held
that
the
trustees
of
a
business
trust
were
the
sole
real
parties
in
interest
and
that
the
beneficiaries
were
not,
even
though
they
stood
to
get
money
as
a
result
of
the
action.
so
i
think
that
would
address
your
honor's
question.
the
text
of
the
statute
still
would
refer
to
“
plaintiff
”.
so
you
would
inquire
in
that
instance
whether
under
state
law
--
this
is
what
happened
in
navarro
--
the
court
inquired,
does
the
executor
have
the
legal
authority
to
represent
the
beneficiaries
as
the
sole
plaintiff;
and
if
he
or
she
does,
then
you
would
have
the
single
plaintiff
situation
and
you
would
not
be
under
cafa.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
when
the
mdl
judge
entered
the
settlement
in
the
class,
she
indicated
her
view
that
it
would
not
preclude
a
parens
case.
of
course,
it's
open
on
remand
for
the
defendants
to
argue
that
the
consumer
settlement
bars
the
attorney
general's
action.
that
will
have
to
be
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
mississippi.
states
are
free
to
adopt
different
rules
about
this.
there
is
no
case
that
we
have
found
in
mississippi
squarely
addressing
this.
there
have
been
a
dozen
or
so
parens
cases
in
the
last
10
years.
there
is
a
case,
though,
from
the
state
of
washington
which
is
illustrative.
it's
actually
on
page
35
of
the
red
brief,
from
our
friend's
brief,
and
it's
a
case
from
the
washington
supreme
court
in
1976
called
ralph
winters
chrysler
plymouth.
in
that
case
the
washington
supreme
court
encountered
the
situation
where
the
state
had
sought
restitution
on
behalf
of
consumers
and
sought
to
distribute
the
money
to
consumers,
and
consumers
also
brought
separate
damages
actions.
and
the
washington
court
said,
there
was
no
double
recovery,
no
preclusion
problem,
because
the
restitution
remedies
were
public
in
nature,
and
the
private
damages
actions
proceeded
under
different
statutory
authority
for
different
claims.
and
whether
mississippi
would
adopt
that
approach,
i
don't
know.
but
that
illustrates,
i
think,
ultimately
that
these
are
questions
of
state
law
and
there
is
a
longstanding
tradition
of
restitution
being
a
public
remedy.
after
all,
the
government
--
we've
cited
some
cases
in
the
brief
involving
everything
from
rent
control
to
energy
price
regulation.
the
government
brings
--
the
federal
government,
as
well
as
state
governments,
has
brought
restitution
actions
where
it
has
not
returned
money
to
consumers,
has
sometimes
done
--
also
sometimes
has
returned
money.
has
--
but
in
all
those
cases
consumers
never
participate.
they
are
never
permitted
to
intervene.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
the
evidence,
the
evidence
of
loss
is
relevant.
but
the
law
is
actually
well-settled
in
the
lower
courts
--
there's
not
a
decision
of
this
court
--
that
a
consumer
releasing
his
claim
or
her
claim
does
not
bar
the
state
from
proceeding
with
a
public
parens
patriae
action.
the
defendants,
when
they
settled,
there
is
a
little
bit
of
disagreement
in
the
brief,
but
the
mdl
judge
took
the
defendants
as
conceding
that
their
settlement
with
consumers
would
not
bar
a
parens--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--that
would
be
a
very
different
case,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
i
think
very
unlikely.
it
depends
on
the
--
for
example,
let
me
just--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--both.
both,
your
honor.
there
are,
there's
no
bright
line.
and
after
all,
snapp,
which
is
the
lodestar
parens
case
from
this
court
in
1982,
involved
only
787
workers.
they
were
agricultural
workers
from
puerto
rico.
and
the
court
--
one
of
the
objections
was,
this
was
not
a
sufficient
quasi-sovereign
interest
to
support
a
parens
patriae
case.
and
what
this
court
said
was
that
you
can't
just
look
at
numbers,
because
those
people
represent
a
public
interest.
they
were
--
they
alleged
wage
discrimination,
and
there
was
a
deterrent
effect.
so
that
it
wasn't
really
just
787;
it
was
the
entire
population
of
puerto
rico.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
we
do
not
think
that
would
be
--
that
is
not
a
proper
parens
patriae
case,
and
the
attorney
general--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
no.
no.
the
parens
patriae
case,
for
example,
here
involves
injunctive
relief,
civil
penalties,
harm
to
the
state
as
a
purchaser
itself
of
lcd
panels.
and
so
restitution
--
the
remedy
doesn't
matter.
but
the
attorney
general
has
statutory
authority
in
this
case
to
bring
a
case
in
the
name
of
the
state.
he
is
actually
prohibited
under
the
state
consumer
protection
act,
all
parties
are
prohibited,
from
bringing
a
damages
case
on
behalf
of
a
private
consumer
except
in
that
consumer's
name,
so--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
no.
i
mean,
the
state
interest
is
broader
than
that.
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
harm
to
mississippi
as
a
--
as
a
population,
as
an
entity
from
this
price-fixing
conspiracy.
just
as
the
federal
government--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
yes,
but
i
think
in
snapp
the
court
discussed
how
the
--
when
a
harm
is
broad
enough,
when
it
affects
a
substantial
segment
of
the
population
and
affects
them
in
their
economic
capacity,
there
are
indirect
as
well
as
direct
effects
that
the
state
could
be
concerned
with.
now,
let
me
just--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
in
other
words,
there
are
--
if
people
are
harmed
by
a
price
fixing
conspiracy,
they
have
less
money,
they're--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
but
that
has
a
ripple
effect
in
the
economy.
price
fixing
conspiracies
have
a
public
dimension.
and
of
course,
of
course,
if
this
--
any
challenge
to
whether
this
is
a
proper
parens
patriae
case
or
any
case
would
be
heard
on
the
merits.
we
know
the
defendants
will
argue
back
in
the
mississippi
courts
that
they
have
a
series
of
defenses
as
to
why
this
case
should
not
be
brought.
one
of
them
will
be
the
attorney
general
should
not
have
brought
it
because
it's
outside
his
authority.
and
that
issue
will
be
decided
in
mississippi.
there
is
a
case,
a
vitamin
price
fixing
conspiracy
case
called
the
basf
case--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
if
there
is
a
harm,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
federal
criminal
allegations
--
there
were
guilty
pleas
and
there
were
800--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--those
are
serious
matters,
and
i
think
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
state
has
separate
interests.
the
interest
that
the
state
has
qua
state,
yes,
it
should
bring
cases
where
the
public
has
been
harmed.
of
course--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
isn't
going
to
happen
because
the
state
--
well,
the
complaints
are
not
the
same.
the
state
has
its
own
--
sues
in
its
own
name
in
its
own
rights
and,
of
course,
the
problem
your
honor
is
hypothesizing--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
it
could
happen,
right.
the
state
--
if
the
state
has
its
own
rights
and
its
own
interests,
it
should
sue.
the
attorney
general
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--if
--
if
--
if
a
state
--
some
states
may
adopt
a
different
rule
from
washington,
as
the
washington
court
said,
the
state
--
the
consumer
claims
would
preclude
a
state
attorney
general
action.
if
a
state
does
not
--
if
the
state
legislature
authorizes
its
attorney
general
to
bring
a
suit
when
this
attorney
general
can
identify
harms
to
the
state
that
are
separate
from
harms
to
consumers.
your
honor
is
saying
that
--
that
the
two
are
identical.
they
are
not.
and
snapp
makes
clear
that
they
are
not.
the
state
has
a
broader
interest
than
simply
the
compensation
interest
that
an
individual
has.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
if
--
if
the
state
attorney
general
was
combined
with
thousands
of
individual
claimants
that
otherwise
would
trigger
cafa,
then
cafa
--
then
you
would
be
forced
into
this
whole
case
situation.
the
whole
case
test,
which
you'd
need
not
reach
here
because
the
statute
and
the
real
party
in
interest
tests
are
clear,
but
under
the
whole
case
test,
you
weigh
whether
the
states
has
an
--
the
essential
nature
proceed
--
the
essential
nature
of
the
proceeding
is
that
the
state
is
the
real
party
in
interest.
in
the
hypothetical
you
posit,
i
think
it
would
be
removable.
obviously,
it
turns
on
the
particular
facts,
but
yes,
if
the
state
attorney
general
is
in
court
with
1,000
individual
claimants,
that
is
probably
a
cafa
case.
that
hasn't
ever
--
has
never
happened,
and
in
all
of
the
districts
outside
the
fifth
circuit,
because
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
only
court
that
has
adopted
the
rule
that
we
--
that
you're
reviewing
today,
every
other
circuit
court
has
held
that
cafa
does
not
extend
to
state
parens
patriae
actions.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
attorneys
general
are
not
running
around
following
class
actions
to
try
to
piggyback
on
top
of
them.
they
are
not
joining
other
class
actions.
those
--
those--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
we
don't
think
so.
and
it
certainly
the
state
--
a
state
would
be
free
to
adopt
a
--
a
different
rule
as
to
preclusion.
in
other
words,
a
state
legislature
could
say
that
a
--
if
--
if
consumers
have
recovered,
the
attorney
general
can't,
or
that
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
statutory
authority
in
such
cases.
but
when
the
state
legislature
has
told
the
attorney
general
to
enforce
the
public
interest
and
given
him
statutory
authority
to
do
so,
he
would
be
derelict
if
he
didn't
honor
the
legislature's
directive.
and
that's
what's
happening
here,
that
in
a
series
of
cases
involving
vitamin
price-fixing,
adulterated
products,
google
street
view
where
google
found
--
you
know,
downloaded
data
from
people's
wireless
networks,
the
attorney
generals
have
responded
in
those
cases.
those
are
what
these
numbers
are
about.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
no,
i
don't
think
there
has
--
i
don't
think
there
had
been
in
virtually
any
of
them.
the
attorney
general
is
--
is
stepping
into
the
breach
when
the
private
lawyers
have
not
brought
class
actions
because
of
the
difficulties
of
bringing
--
in
bringing
class
actions.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
there
is
a
--
there
was
a
class
action
settlement
here.
that
is
true.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
that's
correct.
that's
clearly
--
the
sort
of
mass
consolidation
is
what
the
mass
action
definition
is
addressing.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
there
are.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
particular
the
numbers.
there
are
such
cases
that
--
that
are
filed
in
federal
courts
and
when
the
--
when
the
plaintiffs
are
individually
identifiable.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
if
you
--
if
you
could
identify
the
plaintiffs,
you
don't
need
to
go
through
rule
23.
so
if
you
know
this
150
people
who
are
--
who
are
at
issue,
you
can
avoid
all
the
certification
rulings
and
simply
proceed
on
a
consolidated
basis.
it
just
cuts
off
sort
of
--
part
of
the
inquiry.
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--the
general
public.
the
--
it's
doing
two
things.
first,
the
--
as
the
amicus
brief
of
public
citizen
describes
the
legislative
genesis
of
it,
it
was
really
to
address
the
california
unfair
competition
law
situation
where
there
are
private
attorneys
general
who
are
able
to
bring
suits
in
the
name
of
the
general
interest,
the
general
public.
and
they
--
that
was
sort
of
the
original
genesis
of
it.
it
is
a
separate
reason
to
reverse.
we
believe
we
meet
it
as
well,
because
it
addresses
a
situation
where
a
state
is
--
where
any
litigant,
state
or
private,
is
representing
the
general
public
as
opposed
to
individual
claimants.
and
here,
because
restitution
is
a
public
remedy
and
because
the
individual
claimants
cannot
be
identified,
the
state
is
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
the
general
public
of
mississippi.
if
anyone
--
the
district
court
found
--
it's
in
the
petition
appendix
at
49a
and
50.
the
district
court
discusses
the
traceability
problems
--
i'm
sorry,
i
say
the
petition
appendix,
not
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
the
money
probably
goes
to
the
state
treasury,
because
in
this
case
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
trace
who
gets
--
who
has
been
harmed.
the
--
that's
why
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
given
the
ubiquity
of
the
product
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
central
record
of
whoever
purchased
a
cell
phone
in
mississippi,
that
the
cost
of
--
of
finding
all
these
people
is
--
is
just
not
worth
it.
there
could
be
--
it
could
wind
up
in
the
education
program.
the
attorney
general
had
mentioned
to
me
schools
and
things
like
that,
but
it's
not
going
to
go
--
it's
very
unlikely
to
go
to
the
individual
consumers.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
that
i'd
like
to
raise
on
rebuttal
are
limited.
the
most
important
thing
is
that
jurisdictional
schemes
should
be
simple,
administrable,
predictable.
the
simplest
route
--
the
simplest
interpretation
is
the
one
we
have
shown,
that
these
--
the
statute
is
directed
at
actual
plaintiffs
with
concrete
claims
that
are
proposed
to
be
tried
jointly.
the
only
thing
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
pointed
out
is
the
use
of
the
--
is
the
word
“
persons
”.
justice
sotomayor
is
100
percent
correct
that
the
word
“
persons
”
is
basically
--
is
an
echo
of
rule
20,
of
the
joinder
rule,
which
also
refers
to
persons
and
plaintiffs.
so
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
word
“
person
”
once
in
a
mass
action
definition
simply
confirms
our
point
that
the
statute
is
really
directed
at
the
mass
joinder,
mass
consolidation
situation,
and
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
actions
by
sovereign
states.
their
primary
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
attorney
general
doesn't
really
own
the
claims
in
this
case,
that
these
are
claims
that
are
owned
by
the
citizens
of
mississippi.
that
is
a
classic
state
law
issue,
which
should
be
raised
on
remand
in
the
state
court.
a
very
similar--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
so.
that
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
on
its
--
the
interpretation
of
cafa
and
said
that
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
claims
were
removable.
but
it
didn't
decide
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
sue
in
the
name
of
the
state
under
the
statutes
which
give
him
that
authority.
the
--
we
don't
think
the
fifth
circuit
decided
that
question,
and
i
read
the
red
brief
at
page
33
as
saying
the
attorney
general's
authority
is
not
at
issue
here,
that
we
assume
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
to
bring
the
claims
in
the
complaint
as
he
pled
them,
which
is
the
restitution
claimed
in
the
name
of
the
state.
and
the
--
there
was
a
decision
in
mississippi
in
2006,
the
only
really
relevant
authority.
it's
called
the
basf
case.
and
there,
a
lower
court
in
mississippi,
the
chancery
court,
upheld
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
bring
a
very
similar
parens
patriae
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
what
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
prayer
for
relief
says
is
the
--
“
restitute
to
the
state
”--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
"--
for
its
purchases
and
the
purchases
of
its
citizens.
"
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
so
the
state
will
get
the
money--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--right.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
it--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
the
--
the
evidence
will
be
proven
through
statistical
aggregate
evidence
rather
than
a
list
of
names.
the
list
of
names
is
impractical.
the
--
the
state
will
show
basically
on
the
basis
of
gross
sales--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--in
many
cases,
we
are.
it
is
still
a
public
remedy
of
restitution.
in
many
cases,
the
individuals
may
be
identified.
