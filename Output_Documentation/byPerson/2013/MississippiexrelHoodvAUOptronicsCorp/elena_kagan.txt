mr.
massey,
if
you
are
right
about
what
mass
action
means
in
this
statute,
what
is
this
exception
about
the
general
public
doing?
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
go
on
and
read
that
a
little
bit
further,
mr.
curran--
justice
elena
kagan
--it
says
"claims
of
100
or
more
persons
that
are
proposed
to
tried
jointly
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs'
claims
involve
common
questions
of
law
or
fact.
"
justice
elena
kagan
and
here,
of
course,
you
know,
there's
no
joinder,
let
alone
any
proposed
--
you
know,
there's
no
--
there
nothing
that
the
mississippi
attorney
general
has
to
go
through
to
show
that
the
plaintiffs'
claims
involve
common
questions
of
law
or
fact,
right?
they
don't
--
there's
no
showing
of
that
kind
that
has
to
be
made
in
a
parens
patriae
case.
justice
elena
kagan
but
again,
this
clearly--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
they
don't
have
to
show
--
and
this
is
clearly
referring
to
a
kind
of
rule
23
inquiry,
which
they
don't
have
to
go
through
to
do
a
parens
patriae.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
they
do
have
to
show
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--in
a
massive--
justice
elena
kagan
--consolidation
case--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
judge
is
going
to
say:
you
have
100
claims;
we
want
to
see
that
those
100
claims
have
common
questions
of
law
or
fact.
but
in
a
parens
patriae
case,
the
state
never
has
to
make
that
showing.
it
can
just
stand
up
and
say:
here
we
are.
we
are
the
state.
we're
representing
the
interests
of
the
state
across
state.
here's
our
claim.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
curran,
really,
do
you
--
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
in
this
suit
the
attorney
general
has
to
make
a
proposal
that
--
that
the
plaintiff
--
that
--
that
he
can
bring
the
suit
on
the
grounds
that
the
plaintiffs'
claims
involve
common
questions
of
law
or
fact
and
that
that
proposal
has
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
court?
justice
elena
kagan
but
he
does
not
have
to
show
any
common
questions
of
law
or
fact
in
the
typical
way
that
we
demand.
i
mean,
that's
actually
a
very
demanding
showing
that
we
have
forced
lawyers
to
make
in
the
class
action
context.
all
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
do
is
to
stand
up
and
say,
i
have
a
state
interest
in
protecting
my
citizens
and
in
deterring
improper
behavior
and
here
is
my
substantive
right.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
don't
understand
the
bifurcation
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
attorney
general
is
saying
is
he
has
a
set
of
claims.
they're
his
claims
on
behalf
of
the
--
the
populace,
but
--
but
to
further
state's
own
interests.
and
there
--
there's
none
of
this
rule
23
kind
of
business
about
common
questions
of
law
or
fact.
so
it's
not
a
question
of,
you
know,
one
set
of
claims
or
another
set
of
claims
now
or
later.
he
has
a
claim.
that's
all
he
has.
justice
elena
kagan
and
this
is
the
main
provision
where
they're
trying
to
define
what
mass
action
means.
and
i
take
your
point
that
there
are
--
there's
some
slippage
between
this
provision
and
the
various
provisions
that
it
refers
back
to,
because
those
provisions,
we're
talking
about
class
actions
and
this
one
is
talking
about
mass
actions.
but
this
is
the
essential
definition.
and
this
one
seems
to
be
pointing
to
a
very
different
kind
of
suit,
one
in
which
there
are
100
individual
claims
that
--
that
100
people
seek
to
have
joined
in
which
a
court
is
going
to
make
a
determination
about
whether
those
100
individual
claims
have
questions
of
common
law
or
fact.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
essentially
what
it
says.
i
mean,
the
only
--
the
only
thing
it
doesn't
say
in
what
you
just
said
is
that
it
says
persons
instead
of
named
plaintiffs.
but
then
if
you
read
the
sentence,
it's
pretty
clear
that
persons
and
plaintiffs
are
the
same.
justice
elena
kagan
i
might
not
answer
it.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
but
more
than
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
more
than
that,
mr.
curran,
is
that
there
was
actually
a
considered
effort
by
the
attorneys
generals
here
to
take
themselves
out
of
this
statute--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
that
that
--
well,
you
say
they
failed
and,
i
mean,
that's
the
statutory
question.
but
it's
not
just
congress
didn't
do
it
right
this
time.
it
was
that
there
was
a
very
serious
effort
to
get
attorneys
general
out
of
this
statute.
and
that's
--
and,
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
did
pretty
well.
