let's
assume
a
case
where
--
forget
about
that
the
consumer
action
was
settled.
and
let's
forget
about
a
case
in
which
the
damages
are
difficult
to
prove.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
think
of
a
case
in
which
the
damages
can
be
determined,
and
the
state
comes
in
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
consumers
and
says
we're
seeking
their
restitution.
does
your
argument
change
if
the
facts
are
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
this
a
real
party
in
interest
argument,
or
is
it
a
statutory
argument
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
statute
requires
named
plaintiffs
as
opposed
to
--
named
or
unnamed
plaintiffs,
but
plaintiffs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
remand
a
case
when
it
involves
unnamed
plaintiffs?
not
a
proposed
class,
because
you
--
if
you
have
a
proposed
class,
that
could
be
persons,
and
you
could
identify
those.
but
under
your
theory,
what
does
a
court
do
to
figure
out
which
of
all
of
those
unnamed
people
have
claims
above
or
below
$75,000?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
know,
this
language
is
very
reminiscent
in
what's
in
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
20,
the
joinder
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
if
i
look
at
the
joinder
rule,
it
uses
“
persons
”
and
“
plaintiffs
”
essentially
in
the
same
way.
it's
talking
about
persons
being
proposed
plaintiffs
as
opposed
to
unnamed
people--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--or
the
proposed
class
in
essence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
that
that
would
be
hard,
to
invoke
that
case
when
a
statute
commands
differently.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
that
case,
it's
in
the
--
in
the
absence
of
statutory
language
that
requires
remand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
hard-pressed
to
think
that
we
can
be
exercising
supplemental
jurisdiction
in
a
case
where
congress
has
expressly
spoken
and
said
you
can't
or
shouldn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
would
have
required
this
court--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
doesn't
your
proposal
mean
that
before
someone
can
remove,
they
have
to
decide
whether
the
class
is
certifiable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you're
not
going
to
decide
whether
these
plaintiffs
are
actually
going
to
be
plaintiffs
and
part
of
this
class
until
you
decide
the
class
question.
if
you
use
the
word
“
persons
”
and
you
use
the
language
of
the
statute,
it's
the
class
that's
being
proposed.
it's
the
named
plaintiffs
and
the
class
that's
being
proposed
of
persons
that
are
being
proposed
to
be
tried
together.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
has
to
go
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
don't
go
with
the
facts.
go
with
the
--
with
the
--
the
point,
which
is
that
you
--
in
--
in
a
normal
case,
aren't
you,
in
fact,
suing
for
the
citizens?
the
named
citizens.
or
the
citizens--
