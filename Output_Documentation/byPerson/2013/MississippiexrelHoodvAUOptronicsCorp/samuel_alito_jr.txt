justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
reference
to
persons?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
realize
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i'm
not
sure
why
that
--
why
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
read
two
different
terms
in
the
same
sentence
to
mean
two
different
things.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
persons
could
be
here,
the
citizens
of
mississippi,
who
were
damaged
by
the
activity
in
question.
the
plaintiff
--
plaintiffs,
here
there's
one
named
plaintiff.
the
plaintiffs
can
refer
to
--
to
the
person
or
entity
or
multiple
people
or
entities
who
were
named
as
plaintiffs.
so
why
--
i
don't
see
what
the
inconsistency
is.
