chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
12-1036,
mississippi
v.
au
optronics
corporation.
mr.
massey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
have
an
executor
and
he's
administering
an
estate
in
which
100
people
have
equal
shares
to
the
estate,
and
the
estate
has
a
claim.
and
he
brings
it
on
behalf
of
the
estate.
now,
is
that
covered
as
a
mass
action
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
it
would
make
--
it
would
make
no
sense
for
a
defendant
in
a
class
action
brought
by
consumers
to
ever
settle
the
case.
it's
going
to
have
to
pay
twice.
it's
going
to
have
to
pay
consumers,
and
then
it's
going
to
have
to
pay
you
because
you
can:
say,
well,
we
want
restitution
and
we
are
not
going
to
distribute
it
to
the
class
members,
but
we're
entitled
to
it.
and
i
assume
the
amount
of
the
restitution
is
based
on
some
estimate
of
the
class,
the
consumers'
claims.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
--
what
is
your
understanding
under
mississippi
law,
which
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do,
about
any
limits
on
a
parens
patriae
action?
let's
say
there
was
one
purchaser
in
mississippi
of
lcds,
whatever,
or
two
or
three.
could
you
bring
a
parens
patriae
action
on
their
behalf?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
i'm
trying--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--unlikely
as
a
practical
matter
or
as
a
legal
matter?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
the
state
interest
that's
being
--
the
state
interest
that
is
being
asserted
is
damage
to
the
consumers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
it
harmed
members
of
the
population
of
mississippi,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
damage
to
--
having
less
money
is
a
damage
to
the
consumer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
prevents
--
what
prevents
attorneys
general
from
around
the
country
sitting
back
and
waiting
until
every
--
as
private
class
actions
proceed,
and
as
soon
as
one
settles
or
the
plaintiffs'
class
prevails,
taking
the
same
complaint,
maybe
even
hiring
the
same
lawyers,
to
go
and
say,
well,
now
we
are
going
to
bring
our
parens
patriae
action.
we
know
how
the
trial
is
going
to
work
out
or
we
know
what
the
settlement
is
going
to
look
like,
and
we
are
going
to
get
the
same
amount
of
money
for
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
got
not
nothing
to
do
with
it,
does
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sure
it's
a
serious
matter
when
a
plaintiff
class
recovers
for,
as
in
this
case,
an
antitrust
violation
or
whatever.
what's
the
answer?
i'm
sorry,
repeating
my
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
answer
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
50
attorneys
general,
51,
from
saying,
every
time
there
is
a
successful
class
action
as
to
which
somebody
in
my
state
purchased
one
of
the
items,
we
are
going
to
file
a
parens
patriae
action,
the
complaint
is
going
to
look
an
awful
lot
like
the
class
action
complaint,
and
we
want
our
money?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
counsel,
but
you
told
me
the
state's
own
interest
was
in
protecting
its
consumers,
so
it
would
be
able
to
file
this
suit
every
time
its
consumers
have
been
harmed
as
demonstrated
either
through
settlement
or
suit.
that's
the
state
interest,
protecting
its
consumers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
can't
provide
any
reason
why
they
wouldn't
do
so,
and
presumably
would
start
doing
so
with
greater
frequency
if
you
prevail
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
same
case.
it
can
be
the
next
case
on
the
court's
docket.
the
first
case
is
in
re:
lcd
litigation
and
the
second
case
is
state
of
mississippi
v.
lcd
manufacturers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
there
had
been
private
class
litigation
prior
to
the
filing
of
parens
patriae?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
massey.
mr.
curran?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
curran.
mr.
massey,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
