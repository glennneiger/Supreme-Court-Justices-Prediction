are
there
parens
patriae
actions
where
the
state
attorney
general
brings
the
action
in
what
is
really
a
suit
on
behalf
of
private
parties?
and
if
so,
do
you
call
it
private
parens
patriae?
justice
anthony
m.

in
other
words,
parens
patriae
has
to
have
--
you
have
to
ask
for
restitution?
justice
anthony
m.

well,
that
means
that
it

interest
is
a
little
different,
but
it's
so
much
the
same
that
we
want
to
join
it,
and
we
want
to
join
it
as
parens
patriae.

that
prevent
its
removal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
a
given
that
we
all
concede
that
the
complaint
is
both
for
private-named
persons
and
for
restitution.
both.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
the
rest
of
my
hypothetical,
part
of
the
restitution
goes
to
the
state.

where's
the
language?
