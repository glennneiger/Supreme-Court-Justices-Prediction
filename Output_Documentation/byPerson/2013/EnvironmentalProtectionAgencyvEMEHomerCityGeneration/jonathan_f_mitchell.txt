mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
epa's
actions
in
this
case
have
written
the
states
out
of
the
clean
air
act.
epa
cannot
impose
a
good
neighbor
fip
on
the
states
when
epa
has
left
the
states
completely
in
the
dark
about
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
‶
contribute
significantly
″.
epa's
approach
requires
the
states
to
submit
sips
that
can
only
guess
at
how
epa
will
quantify
their
good
neighbor
obligations
under
section
7410
(a)(2)(d).
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
epa's
actions
are
unlawful
for
several
independent
reasons.
the
first
is
epa's
actions
in
this
case
represent
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
change
in
the
way
that
the
agency
has
interpreted
the
statute.
for
15
years,
starting
with
the
naaqs
sip
call
in
1998,
epa
told
the
states
not
to
submit
good
neighbor
state
--
good
neighbor
sips
before
epa
had
quantified
the
state's
obligations
under
(a)(2)(d).
and
epa
repeated
that
stance
numerous
times,
including
in
the
disapproval
of
nevada
sip
that
we
cite
on
pages
9
and
59
of
our
brief,
and
also
in
the
sources
of
the
d.c.
circuit
cites
on
pages
51,
52
and
56
of
the
petition
appendix.
epa
has
now
done
a
180-degree
shift
and
they
have
told
the
states
that
they
are
required
to
submit
good
neighbor
state
--
sips
before
epa
has
quantified
their
obligations
under
subsection
(a)(2)(d).
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
because
that's
the
approach
epa
rejected
in
the
naaqs
sip
call.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
epa
is
allowed
to
change
their
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
if
they're
going
to
do
that,
they
have
to
acknowledge
in
the
transport
rule
that
they're
abandoning
the
prior
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
no,
they're
not
prevented
from
making
the
change,
but
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--but
we
can
propose
and
submit
the
sip
only
after
the
fip
has
already
been
imposed
on
the
states.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
we
do
not
have
a
position
on
the
question
of
whether
epa
can
consider
costs.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
we
represent
a
coalition
of
states.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
there's
simply
no
consensus
among
the
states
on
that
question.
[laughter]
so
we
are
remaining
agnostic
on
that
point.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
it
depends.
it
really
does.
we
don't
know
exactly
what
our
obligations
are.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
no,
it
takes
months.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
we're
still
waiting
for
epa
to
decide
on
the
sip
that
we
submitted
to
implement
the
good
neighbor
obligations
for
the
2006
particulate
matter
standard.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
well,
it's
still
an
unlawful
use
of
the
fip
authority
for
several
reasons,
and
this
gets
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
why
is
this
unlawful?
and
there's
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
epa
has
changed
its
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
the
key
language
from
the
naaqs
sip
call
appears
on
pages
57,368
through
370,
where
epa
tells
the
states,
we
don't
want
you
to
submit
good
neighbor
sips
that
simply
take
a
guess
at
what
you
think
the
good
neighbor
obligations
are.
we
will
quantify
your
obligations
in
a
rule
first
and
then--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--the
statute--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--not
only
that,
they
said
in
the
naaqs
sip
calls
that
they
are
adopting
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
prohibits
us
from
doing
that.
but
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
epa
adopted
is
that
epa,
and
only
epa,
is
the
institution
that
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
quantifying
a
state's
good
neighbor
obligations.
the
states
had
argued
for
a
different
approach
back
in
1998.
we
wanted
to
have
the
prerogative
to
decide
what
the
good
neighbor
obligations
mean;
and
epa
said,
no,
we
are
the
sole
entity
with
that
prerogative
and
you
need
to
wait
until
we
issue
a
rule
that
quantifies
your
obligations.
epa
has
now
changed
that
approach
without
explaining
or
acknowledging
in
the
transport
rule
that
they
were
abandoning
their
earlier
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
what
they
said
on
a
naaqs
sip
call
was
they
have
to
quantify
the
good
neighbor
obligations.
they
have
to
tell
the
states
what
it
means
to
contribute
significantly
to
another
state's
air
pollution.
and
that
leads
to
a
second
statutory
problem
with
this
regime
in
the
transport
rule.
the
states
have
the
prerogative
under
the
clean
air
act
to
do
what
the
federal
minimum
requirements
are
for
clean
air
and
to
go
no
further.
epa's
approach
here
requires
the
states,
when
they
submit
or
propose
sips
and
they
have
to
take
a
wild
guess
as
to
what
their
good
neighbor
obligations
are,
it
effectively
compels
the
states
to
overcontrol
and
overregulate,
because
if
they
want
epa
to
approve
the
sip
and
they
don't
know
what
their
good
neighbor
obligations
will
be,
they
have
to
overshoot
and
overcontrol
and
overregulate
or
risk
the
epa
will
deny
their
sip
and
impose
a
fip
on
the
state.
and
what
epa
is
essentially
doing
is
telling
the
states
that
if
you
want
to
do
only
what
the
federal
floor
requires
and
to
go
no
further,
the
price
of
that
is
that
you
have
to
accept
an
epa-imposed
fip
that
defines
those
obligations
rather
than
giving
the
state
the
opportunity
to
distribute
regulatory
burdens
in
a
sip
as
it
sees
fits.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
i
agree
that
the
epa
has
that
discretion.
the
problem
is
that
in
the
nox
sip
call
in
1998
they
asserted
exclusive
interpretative
authority
over
subsection
(a)(2)(d),
which
is
the
good
neighbor
provision
of
the
clean
air
act.
and
they
said
that
epa
is
the
institute
might
quantify
the
states'
good
neighbor
obligations.
until
epa
fills
in
the
blanks
and
tells
the
states
what
this
‶
contributes
significantly
″
phrase
means,
it's
an
empty
requirement.
epa
could
have
taken
a
different
approach
in
the
nox
sip
call.
they
could
have
told
the
states
you
can
take
the
first
crack
at
defining
what
‶
contributes
significantly
″
means,
and
we'll
review
your
submission
and
approve
or
disapprove
it.
but
what
they
said,
15
years
ago,
was
that
the
states
need
to
wait
for
epa
to
quantify
the
obligations
in
a
rule.
once
epa
asserts
that
exclusive
interpretive
authority
over
the
provision,
the
states
have
no
obligation
to
guess
at
what
epa
might
do
in
the
future
when
they
submit
the
sip.
and
that
leads
to
a
second
independent
problem
with
epa's
transport
rule,
because
epa
had
no
authority
to
impose
federal
implementation
plans
for
the
1997
standards
on
the
22
states
that
already
had
epa-approved
sips
in
place
for
those
standards.
epa--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--three
of
the
states
have
challenged
their--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--the
united
states
is
suggesting
that
we're
somehow
launching
an
improper
collateral
attack
because
the
states
could
have
challenged
the
earlier
sip
disapprovals
or
earlier
findings
of
failure
to
submit.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
but
those
judicial
proceedings
have
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
i
don't
think
the
court
should
wait
because
the
issues
that
we're
raising
are
discrete
from
what's
being
challenged
by
those
three
states
in
their
separate
proceedings.
the
arguments
we're
making
are
that,
first,
epa
has
no
authority
to
impose
a
fip
on
the
states
before
quantifying
the
good
neighbor
obligations
under
(a)(2)(d);
and,
second,
epa
improperly
invokes
the
corrections--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--we're
not
relying
solely
on
the
statute,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
our
argument
is
that
epa
has
changed
its
interpretation
of
the
statute
from
the
nox
sip
call
to
the
transport
rule
without
adequately
acknowledging
or
explaining
how
its
new
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
statute.
but
we're
also
relying
on
the
statute
as
well,
because,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
(a)(2)(d)
requires
the
states
to
eliminate
pollution
that
contributes
significantly
to
another
state's
nonattainment.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
right.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
epa
has
done
this
before.
i
mean,
with
the
cair
fips
when
they
first
quantified
the
states'
good
neighbor
obligations,
they
gave
the
states
an
opportunity
to
submit
sips
before
the
cair
federal
implementation
plans
would
take
effect.
and
epa
agrees
that
the
states
have
no
ability
to
guess
accurately
at
how
epa
will
quantify
their
good
neighbor
obligation.
they
can't--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--it's
not
impossible
for
epa
to
decide
what
‶
contribute
significantly
″
means.
that's
their
job.
they've
asserted
that
prerogative.
they
can
choose
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
phrase.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
yes,
that's
the
section
7410(k)(6)
issue
that
we
mentioned
in
the
brief.
epa
had
previously
approved
good
neighbor
sips
for
22
states
that
implemented
the
1997
standards
for
ozone
in
a
particular
map.
once
epa
approves
a
state's
sip,
its
ability
to
impose
a
fip
on
the
sip
--
on
that
state
expires
under
the
statute.
so
epa
had
a
problem
for
those
22
states;
how
would
they
be
able
to
impose
fips
when
they
had
previously
approved
sips.
epa
says
in
the
transport
rule
that
they
are
going
to
invoke
the
corrections
power
of
(k)(6),
and
(k)(6)
says
that
if
epa
determines
that
a
prior
decision
approving
a
sip
was
in
error,
then
epa--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--well,
it's
not
being
determined
because
the
proceedings
have
been
stayed.
but,
yes,
three
states,
kansas,
georgia
and
ohio,
have
challenged
it.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
epa
invoked
its
corrections
power
under
(k)(6),
but
(k)(6)
says
that
a
correction
must
be
made,
quote,
‶
in
the
same
manner
as
″,
end
quote,
the
decision
being
corrected.
epa's
approvals
of
the
earlier
sips
went
through
notice
and
comment.
because
of
that,
(k)(6)
requires
that
the
corrections
likewise
go
through
notice
and
comment,
and
the
corrections
here
did
not
go
through
notice
and
comment.
there's
no
disagreement
between
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents
on
that
point.
the
united
states
tries
to
get
out
of
this
problem
by
saying
that
they
can
use
the
good
cause
exception
to
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
that's
found
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that
doesn't
help
epa
at
all,
because
the
requirement
comes
not
from
the
administrative
procedure
act;
the
requirement
to
use
notice
and
comment
comes
from
(k)(6).
it
doesn't
help
epa
to
rely
on
an
exception
to
a
statute
when
the
statute
providing
that
exception
is
not
the
statute
that
imposes
the
requirement.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
because
that
caveat
does
not
appear
in
(k)(6).
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
i
think
your
argument
or
suggestion
is
that
epa
could
rely
on
the
normal
rule
set
forth
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
we
don't
think
that's
a
tenable
construction
of
(k)(6).
i
mean,
(k)(6)
authorizes
epa
to
make
corrections,
but
it
says
specifically
the
corrections
must
be
made
in
the
same
manner
as
the
decision
being
corrected.
if
the
decision
being
corrected
went
through
notice
and
comment,
the
corrections
have
to
go
through
notice
and
comment
as
well.
if
the
decision
being
corrected
went
through
formal
adjudication,
then
the
correction
must
also
go
through
formal
adjudication.
and
epa
doesn't
try
to
make
that
argument
in
their
brief
about
what
(k)(6)
means.
they
are
just
trying
to
say
that
the
good
cause
exception
in
the
apa
to
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
should
carry
over
here,
and
there's--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--if
that's
what
the
statute
means
then
(k)(6)
doesn't
constrain
the
agency
much
at
all,
because--
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
--the
text
says
‶
in
the
same
manner
as
″.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
in
the
same
manner.
so
it's
looking
back
to
the
original
decision
and
how
it
was
made.
and
that's
the
second
reason
we've
provided
for
why
the
d.c.
circuit
decision
should
be
affirmed.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
reach
the
(k)(6)
issue,
there's
also
the
question
of
whether
the
fips
can
be
severed,
because
the
(k)(6)
argument
doesn't
--
i
see
my
time's
expired.
mr.
jonathan
f.
mitchell
the
(k)(6)
argument
doesn't
knock
out
all
of
the
steps
on
--
standing
alone.
it
would
require
--
announces
the
severability
question.
thank
you.
