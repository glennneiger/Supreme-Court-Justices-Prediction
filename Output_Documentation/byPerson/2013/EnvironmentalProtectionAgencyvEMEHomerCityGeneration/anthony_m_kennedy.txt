justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
your
--
your
answer
to
justice
kagan's
question
and
justice
scalia's
question
that
it
depends
on
the
time
point,
at
the
time
at
which
you
measure?
that
is
to
say,
if
you
take
a
look
at
a
state
which
for
5
years
has
been
trying
to
ameliorate
pollution,
you
can
measure
it
from
the
point
5
years
ago;
and
if
you
do
that,
then
they're
not
having
to
contribute
more.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
don't
you
like
that
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
far
back?
how
far
back
do
you
go
for
the
relevant
naaq?
2006
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--just
one
more
question
on
cost.
in
--
in
your
answer
to
justice
kagan's
question,
there
is
at
least
a
possible
argument
that
you,
the
regulator,
the
government,
the
epa,
can
take
cost
into
account
unless
it's
expressly
prohibited
from
doing
so.
you
don't
go
that
far.
but
you
--
you
even
stop
short
of
that.
you
say
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
apply
the
cost
rationale
at
the
implementation
stage?
i
--
i
think
that's
what
you
said
and
if
so,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
at
least
if
you've
adopted
a
sip
or
proposed
a
sip,
you've
given
reasons,
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
rational
plan,
and
the
epa
then
must
give
a
reasoned
response
to
it.
whereas,
if
the
epa
is
the
first
one,
they're
writing
on
a
blank
slate;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
some
respects,
the
epa
is
more
constrained
under
this
process
to
which
you
object.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
--
you're
saying
that
‶
significant
″
must
mean
only
measurable
amounts.
it
can't
mean
--
pick
your
word
--
culpability,
feasibility,
responsibility,
feasibility.
one
state
finds
it
quite
feasible
from
a
cost
standpoint
to
reduce
emissions
by
a
factor
of
10.
the
other
state
is
the
--
justice
breyer's
example,
finds
that
it
can't
do
it
except
if
it's
a
factor
of
a
hundred.
can't
you
say
that
the
contribution
in
one
case
is
more
significant
than
the
other
based
on
feasibility?
maybe
you
can't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
word
--
the
word
‶
significantly
″
does
import
a
judgmental
component.
i
think,
that's
what
the
government
is
going
to
say.
i
just
wanted
to
as
you
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--maybe
they'll
have
a
better
answer.
