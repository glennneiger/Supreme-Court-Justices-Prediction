justice
elena
kagan
is
the
idea,
mr.
stewart,
that
the
states
that
are
required
to
do
more
are
the
states
that
haven't
done
much
already?
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
a
question?
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
a
question?
following
up
on
justice
scalia
about
the
statutory
language
and
how
you
read
it,
i
think,
you
know,
most
people,
everybody,
thinks
that
it's
better
to
regulate
with
attention
to
costs
than
to
regulate
without
attention
to
costs.
we
have
this,
our
trucking
association
decision
where
we
said,
well,
notwithstanding
that
everybody
agrees
that
regulating
with
attention
to
costs
is
better,
when
congress
says
the
opposite
we
have
to
go
with
the
opposite.
and
there
we
said
congress
had
said
the
opposite
because
it
had
talked
about
protecting
the
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety.
now,
i'm
wondering,
what
does
it
take
in
a
statute
to
make
us
say,
look,
congress
has
demanded
that
the
regulation
here
occur
without
any
attention
to
costs?
in
other
words,
essentially
congress
has
demanded
that
the
regulation
has
occurred
in
a
fundamentally
silly
way.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
stewart--
justice
elena
kagan
--could
you
explain
that
to
me,
mr.
stewart?
because
are
you
saying
that
the
straight
proportionality
approach
that
was
applied
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
are
you
saying
that
that's
impossible
or
are
you
saying
it's
complicated
and
dumb?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sure
i
should
know
this
after
reading
all
these
briefs,
but
if
we
--
if
we
reverse
the
d.c.
circuit
what
would
happen
going
forward?
in
other
words,
the
states
have
had
this
time
to
--
to
go
first
and
to
do
their
sips.
then
they
were
found
not
to
comply,
so
the
epa
does
its
fip.
but
that's
not
the
end
of
the
game,
is
it?
i
mean,
isn't
the
epa
under
a
continuing
obligation
to
look
at,
review
its
naaqs,
to
give
the
states
further
opportunities
to
come
back?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mitchell,
i
might
just
not
be
understanding
you,
but
this
goes
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
the
statute
says,
look,
after
these
standards
are
originally
promulgated,
the
state
gets
3
years
to
make
its
best
pitch,
and
then
the
administrator
shall
promulgate
a
fip
at
any
time
within
two
years
after
that.
now,
presumably
there
are
lots
of
conversations
that
can
happen
between
the
epa
and
the
states
during
those
5
years,
and
maybe
sometimes
more
of
those
conversations
happen
and
sometimes
less
of
those
conversations
happen.
but
i
don't
see
that
as
different
constructions
of
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
as
the
statute
sets
up
its
framework:
you
go
first,
do
it
within
3
years;
then
the
epa
goes,
it
has
to
do
it
within
2
years.
the
epa
just
has
very
substantial
discretion
under
this
statute
as
to
what
kinds
of
conversations
it
wants
to
have
when,
within
that
broad
structure.
why
am
i
not
reading
it
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
can't
--
this
is
of
course
a
statute
on
which
epa
gets
substantial
chevron
deference.
why
couldn't
we
read
that
language
to
essentially
mean
subject
to
the
same
procedural
requirements
as
the
original?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
not
a
caveat.
it's
just
a
different
understanding
of
what
that
language
means.
i
mean,
you
say
it
has
to
be
in
the
exact
same
--
in
the
exact
same
way
they
previously
acted,
and
i
guess
i'm
saying
it
could
mean
subject
to
the
exact
same
procedural
requirements.
was
that
not
clear?
was
that
unclear?
justice
elena
kagan
whatever
procedural
requirements
constrained
epa
when
it
approved
the
sip,
those
were
the
same
procedural
requirements
that
constrained
epa
when
it's
disapproved
the
sip.
but
we're
just
asking
are
they
--
you
know,
both
are
--
have
to
be
subject
to
the
same
procedural
requirements.
epa
can
act
differently
as
long
as
they
are
acting
within
that
same
set
of
rules.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
that
they
are
trying
to
make
that
argument.
they
are
saying,
in
the
initial
version
we
could
have
done
it
by
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
or
we
could
have
done
it
if
we
had
good
cause.
so
too
when
we
reverse
that
initial
determination.
justice
elena
kagan
so,
mr.
keisler,
i
mean,
you
have
a
statute
here
that
clearly
does
not
have
any
language
about
no
costs
allowed,
that
also
does
not
have
what
the
american
trucking
association
statute
had,
which
was
like
public
health
only,
sufficient
margin
of
safety;
right?
so
none
of
that.
what
you
have
is
exactly
what
you
said.
you
have
a
statute
that
focuses
on
causal
contribution,
right?
so
this
is
a
hard
problem,
right?
because
--
i
mean,
let
me
just
sort
of
give
you
a
numerical
example,
which
i'm
sure
is
as
simplistic
as
the
other
numerical
examples
floating
around
this
case.
but,
you
know,
let's
say
that
the
standard
is
a
hundred.
and
there's
a
state
that
has
120,
and
there
are
two
states,
x
and
y,
that
have
each
contributed
20.
right?
so
we
--
you
know,
we
only
need
20
of
those.
we
have
40.
and
the
question
is
how
do
you
get
from
those
40
to
those
20.
the
d.c.
circuit
would
just
say,
well,
we
take
10
from
each.
but
if
this
--
if
the
question
is
only
about
causal
contribution
and
that's
all
that
the
statute
talks
about,
there
have
to
be
other
ways
we
can
make
that
determination
of
what
contribution
each
should
be
legally
responsible
for,
right?
and
what
the
epa
said
here
was:
we're
going
to
distinguish
between
--
we're
going
to
distinguish
between
states
that
have
--
have
put
a
lot
of
technology
and
a
lot
of
money
into
this
already
and
on
the
other
hand
states
that
have
lots
of
cheap
and
dirty
emissions.
and
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
rational
thing
to
do
under
this
very
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
keisler,
the
nature
of
this
problem
is
that
there's
an
allocation
issue.
it's
not
just
everybody
gets
down
to
a
certain
threshold
level.
it's
there's
a
level
and
we
have
to
allocate.
and
the
question
is:
what
are
we
going
to
allocate
on
the
basis
of?
and
the
word
‶
amounts
″
doesn't
tell
you
what
you're
going
to
allocate
on
the
basis
of.
so
there
are
lots
of
different
choices
for
what
we
can
allocate
on
the
basis
of.
we
can
just
divide,
you
know,
and
do
it
all
proportionally.
we
can
take
into
account
per
capita.
we
can
take
into
account
a
state's
population
if
we
wanted
to.
or
we
can
take
into
account,
as
the
epa
did
here,
costs
on
the
understanding
that
costs
reflect
how
much
of
an
investment
a
state
has
already
made
in
pollution
technology.
so
the
statute,
neither
the
word
‶
amount
″
nor
anything
else
says
anything
about
those
different
methods
of
allocation,
does
it?
