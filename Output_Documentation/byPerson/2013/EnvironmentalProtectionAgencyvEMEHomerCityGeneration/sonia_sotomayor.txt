mr.
stewart,
below,
the
government
conceded
that
there
was
a
theoretical
possibility
that
some
states
could
be
overcontrolled,
that
they
would
be
implementing
measures
that
would
reduce
their
contributions
to
pollution
below
the
1
percent.
assume
that
--
i
think
there's
a
theoretical
possibility
of
that
--
but
that
your
approach
was
basically
fine.
what
would
we
do
about
that?
first
of
all,
are
there
measures
states
can
take
to
get
out
of
the
fip
if
it's
inappropriate
to
them
because
of
overcontrol?
and
if
not
--
and
how
do
they
do
it?
i
mean,
what's
the
process?
if
we
think
there's
a
flaw,
do
we
vacate
the
rule?
do
we
leave
it
in
place?
what
do
we
do?
and
what
--
and
what's
our
power
to
do
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
we
were
to
rule
against
you
and
affirm
the
decision
below,
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
to
get
a
new
rule
in
place?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
not
prevented
from
giving
a
counter
sip
is
what
they
were
being
told.
you
can
--
you
can
counter,
is
what
the
government
is
saying,
and
so
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
they've
estopped
you
from
doing
your
own
sip.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
difference?
if
you
think
they're
wrong,
you
give
a
counter-sip
and
you
duke
it
out
with
them
in
terms
of
what
you
think
--
where
you
think
they
are
wrong
as
applied
to
you.
but
let
me
ask
you
something
fundamental
about
this.
are
you
challenging
the
transport
rule
using
cost
or
are
you
just
challenging
the
process
in
which
that
was
achieved?
because
if
i
understand
all
the
amici
briefs
and
the
theory
of
this,
not
even
you
would
want
a
command-and-control
regulation;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it'd
be
crazy
if
they
didn't,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
and
for
some
of
them,
it
would
really
be
a
bad
idea,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
were
doing
that
with
respect
to
the
naaqs.
i
thought
that
was
them
saying
they
had
to
quantify
the
naaqs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
haven't
some
states
already
challenged
that?
isn't
that
pending
below?
why
should
we
be
looking
at
that
issue
here
when
states
have
challenged
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
why
the
rest
didn't,
but
three
of
them
have.
so
why
should
we
enter
the
fray
anticipatorily?
isn't
that
an
issue
we
should
wait
and
see
what
epa
says
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
this
is
a
very
discrete
question,
that
they've
already
approved
some
sips.
three
states
have
already
challenged
the
fact
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
meet
a
new
standard
because
they've
already
had
an
old
standard
approved.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
discrete
challenge,
and
three
states
have
undertaken
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
don't
know
why,
but
that's
a
different
issue.
even
though
it
has,
wouldn't
it
be
more
prudent
for
us
to
wait
for
that
administrative
process
to
finish
before
we
venture
into
this
question?
that's
my
--
my
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
the
issue
that
the
three
states
are
challenging
below,
just
that
discrete
issue
about
whether
the
epa
can
call
this
a
corrective
action
or
not?
isn't
that
entire
issue
being
determined
in
those
proceedings?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
this
issue
is
what's
at
issue
there,
part
of
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
battle
mr.
stewart's
point
that
congress
surely
didn't
intend
to
shut
down
these
plants
if
they
didn't
or
couldn't
feasibly
reduce
their
contributions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
they
couldn't
feasibly
do
it,
doesn't
the
words
‶
significantly
contribute
″
have
to
take
into
account
in
some
way
the
cost
of
reducing
the
amount?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
found
a
way
to
do
that
with
the
cost
tradeoff
with
the
cap
and
trade
system--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
the
industry
itself
can
make
that
choice,
with
the
state
presumably.
they're
not
stopping
a
sip
that
stops
a
state
from
participating.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
say
that's
not
a
theoretical
possibility
under
the
numbers
they've
worked
out.
so
why
isn't
this
taken
care
of
in
the
process
that
permits
individual
states
to
challenge
this
as
applied?
