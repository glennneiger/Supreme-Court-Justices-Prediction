mr.
peter
keisler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
private
party
respondents
are
focused
on
the
statutory
limitations
to
the
epa's
authority
under
the
good
neighbor
provision.
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
issue
that
my
friend
from
the
government
focused
on
a
lot,
which
is
the
use
of
cost,
and
to
explain
not
only
what
we
think
the
statute
requires
in
this
regard,
but
why,
justice
kagan,
it
would
be
neither
silly
nor
dumb;
or,
justice
sotomayor,
crazy
to
read
the
statute
the
way
we
suggest.
and
we
begin
with
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
authorizes
the
prohibition
only
of
amounts
that
contribute
significantly
to
nonattainment
or
interfere
with
maintenance
in
downwind
locations.
the
focus
of
that
language
we
think
is
quite
clearly
on
the
effects
of
a
state's
emissions
on
other
states,
and
not
on
the
cost
of
reducing
them.
what
epa
has
done
here
is
assert
that
it
has
the
power
to
increase
a
state's
reduction
obligations
beyond
what
a
focus
on
the
effects
of
its
emissions
would
require,
simply
because
epa
has
decided
that
it
would
be
reasonably
affordable
for
that
state
to
bear
a
higher
burden.
and
what
that
means
is
that
states
here
which
are
making
only
a
very
slight
contribution
to
air
quality
problems
in
downwind
states
are
nonetheless
required
to
make
very
substantial
reductions,
in
many
cases
far
more
than
states
that
are
making
far
greater
contributions
to
poor
air
quality
in
the
same
downwind
locations.
there
is
no
relationship
at
all
under
the
epa's
methodology
between
the
amount
a
state
contributes
and
the
amount
it
has
to
reduce,
because
the
entire
driver
is
cost.
mr.
stewart
said
that
cost
was
one
component.
it's
not
one
component.
it
is
the
entire
driver.
mr.
peter
keisler
i'll
try
to
respond
to
that
--
that
fully,
justice
breyer.
certainly,
it
is
the
case
and
we
would
acknowledge
that
there
are
always
going
to
be
legitimate
policy
arguments
in
favor
of
the
least
cost,
most
efficient
solution
to
any
problem.
but
we
would
also
say
that
there
are
countervailing
policy
arguments
at
issue
here,
and
we
do
believe
the
statute
sides
with
those
countervailing
policy
arguments.
and
the
countervailing
policy
arguments
here
are
focused
on
the
fact
that
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
where
there's
one
state
that
it
would
cost
more
to
reduce
and
another
state
it
would
cost
less.
the
only
scenario
in
which
you
get
a
different
result
under
the
epa's
approach
and
our
approach
is
where
the
state
that
would
cost
more
to
reduce
is,
in
fact,
contributing
a
lot
more
to
the
downwind
state's
air
problem
than
the
other
state.
and
for
several
reasons
we
think
when
the
statute
looks
at
that
issue
and
asks
the
question
of
whether
epa
should
have
the
authority
to
force
the
state
which
is,
in
fact,
contributing
less
to
nonetheless
reduce
more
simply
because
it's
costly,
we
think
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
the
statute
embodies
the
policy
choice
that
says
no,
the
state
that
contributes
more,
reduces
more;
the
state
that
contributes
less,
reduce
less.
the
first
is
the
one
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
which
is
the
statutory
text
which
we
think
quite
clearly
is
focused
on
the
effects.
"significantly
contribute
to
nonattainment
or
interfere
with
maintenance
in
downwind
locations.
"
but
the
second
is
the
whole
structure
of--
mr.
peter
keisler
--amounts
--
great.
that
significantly
contribute.
mr.
peter
keisler
no,
that's
right.
and
i
don't
think
the
word
‶
significantly
″
can
bear
the
weight
that
mr.
stewart
places
on
it.
it
modifies
the
words
‶
contribute
to
nonattainment
″.
so
it's
about
the
degree
of
causal
contribution.
and
it
doesn't
modify
at
all
the
phrase
‶
interference
with
maintenance
″,
and
they've
used
the
same
cost
methodology
to
implement
that
as
well.
but
the
second
beyond
the
text,
the
whole
structure
of
the
clean
air
act
is
focused
on
treating
the
states
as
separate
entities
which
are
responsible
for
the
emissions
that
happen
within
their
borders
and
the
effect
that
those
emissions
have
on
other
states.
that's
why
this
is
in
a
sip
rather
than
some
general
epa
regulation,
and
that's
why
the
language
of
the
statute
is
what
it
is:
amounts
of
emissions
within
a
state.
and
in
this
regard,
i
think
it's
--
it's
telling
that
in
the
reply
brief,
what
the
government
said
was
that
it
believes
it
has
the
kind
of
authority
here
to
consider
cost
that
would
be
considered
by
a
chancellor
at
equity
in
a
nuisance
case.
a
chancellor
at
equity
in
a
nuisance
case
had
private
party
defendants
before
him
or
her.
and
so,
of
course,
they
were
allocating
burdens
on
the
basis
of
equity
and
efficiency
and
all
the
kinds
of
things
a
common
law
chancellor
can
take
into
account.
the
epa
has
before
it
separate
states
with
separate
responsibilities
who
have
a
long,
historic
role
and
responsibility
of
enforcing
emissions
control
procedures
within
their
border,
and
congress
could
rightly
or
reasonably
at
least
have
concluded
that
it
didn't
want
epa
to
have
the
same
authority
to
shift
costs
and
efficiency
and
equity
around
among
different
states
to
require--
mr.
peter
keisler
--i
think
there's
one
thing
i
can
cite,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
the
statutory
history
in
this
case
is
that
the
predecessor
version
to
what
we
currently
have
before
us
simply
said
that
states
were
required
to
prohibit
the
amounts
which
prevent
attainment
or
maintenance.
no
word
‶
significantly
″.
just
prevent
attainment
or
maintenance.
i
think
certainly,
looking
at
that
language,
there's
nothing
in
there
that
would
suggest
that
costs
can
be
taken
into
account.
what
congress
said
in
the
committee
report
in
1990,
when
it
added
the
words
"significantly
contribute
to
nonattainment
and
interfere
with
maintenance.
"
was
that
it
was
doing
that
precisely
because
it
recognized
that
this
was
a
provision
that
addressed
causation
of
bad
air
quality
effects.
because
what
it
was
doing
was
not
introducing
some
new
element
of
cost,
but
relaxing
the
causation
standard,
saying
it
shouldn't
be
something
like
but-for
causation
where
the
question
just
doesn't
prevent
attainment
or
maintenance.
it's
enough
if
it
contributes
significantly
to
nonattainment
or
interfere.
mr.
peter
keisler
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
in
the
example
that
your
honor
gave,
where
you
had
the
two
states
and
should
they
be
each
reduced
to
ten,
the
reason
in
favor
of
doing
it
that
way
from
a
statutory
perspective
is
that
that
then
gives
a
consistent
application
to
the
same
causal
language
in
the
statute,
which
means
that
the
same
causal
effect
from
one
upwind
state
on
a
downwind
state
isn't
significant
if
it
comes
from
indiana
to
delaware,
but
insignificant
if
it
comes
from
tennessee;
and
that
when
the
statute
says
that
states
must
prohibit
the
amounts
they
significantly
contribute,
then
the
more
they
contribute
the
more
they
reduce.
so
we
see
that
as
fitting
much
more
securely
within
the
statutory
language
than
the
kind
of
shifting
that
your
honor
mentioned.
certainly
one
could
imagine,
since
the
policy
rationales
that
are
behind
your
honor's
question
are
certainly
legitimate
and
more
than
plausible,
certainly
one
could
imagine
a
statute
that
congress
could
have
written
which
would
have
said:
treat
it
at
as
national
playing
field;
ignore
the
fact
that
there
are
state
boundaries;
think
about
what
the
most
efficient
way
to
force
reductions
to
achieve
attainment
in
downwind
locations;
locate
those
reductions
in
the
least
cost
areas,
and
impose
those
on
the
states.
surely,
if
that
was
what
congress
had
intended
it
wouldn't
have
written
the
statute
which
directs
each
state
to
include
in
its
sip
provisions
that--
mr.
peter
keisler
--yes,
your
honor,
but
we
think
the
statute--
mr.
peter
keisler
--your
honor,
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
industry
and
labor,
so
certainly
we
believe
that
there
have
to
be
mechanisms
to
deal
with
the
kinds
of
problems
that
your
honor
just
identified.
but
we
don't
think
they
come
out
of
defining
the
amounts
that
significantly
contribute
to
nonattainment.
we
think
that
those
kinds
of
considerations
come
into
play
elsewhere
in
the
process.
in
the
american
trucking
case
that's
been
referred
to,
the
court
said
that
when
states
are
implementing
the
requirements
of
the
epa,
for
example,
by
deciding
to
allocate
among
different
sources
what
the
--
how
the
reduction
would
be
distributed,
they
can
take
costs
into
account.
and
there
are
other
mechanisms
in
the
sip
process
when
that
definition
of
what
amount
significantly
contributes
is
then
translated
into
an
emission
reduction
obligation.
we
do
think
there
are
occasions,
and
we've
noted
them
in
note
17
of
our
brief,
where
the
state
in
then
formulating
its
sip
can
say,
okay,
this
is
the
amount
we
have
to
reduce,
but
we're
going
to
do
it
in
this
way
because
costs
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
but
that
is
a
very
different
matter
from
saying
that
epa,
in
defining
what
amounts
significantly
contribute,
can
do
the
same
thing.
and
the
reason
it's
different,
the
reason
it's
not
just,
oh,
we're
locating
it
in
some
different
box
what
epa
wants
to
do
in
its
box,
is
that
the
box
that
we're
locating
it
in
makes
clear
that
it
functions
as
the
kind
of
break
your
honor
described.
if
something
is
unfeasible
or
economic,
there
are
ways
to
soften
it
out
at
the
end.
mr.
peter
keisler
well--
mr.
peter
keisler
--well,
the
trading
presents
to
me
issues
under
the
statute.
we
support
trading
anywhere
it's
appropriate,
but
this
is
a
statute
which
is
focused
on
providing
relief
to
downwind
states.
and
if,
to
take
my
other
example,
if
indiana
is
contributing
emissions
into
delaware
that
hurt
its
air
quality,
it
does
no
good
for
delaware
if
indiana
purchases
allowances
from
tennessee,
which
isn't
contributing
to
delaware.
mr.
peter
keisler
i'd
like
to
resist
the
role
your
honor--
mr.
peter
keisler
--has
assigned
me
of
bringing
death
and
destruction
and
starvation.
[laughter]
mr.
peter
keisler
but
in
some
ways
the
distinction
is
the
one
i
was
drawing
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
which
is
that
when
you
get
down
to
the
level
of
implementing
these
things
you
can
take
into
account
whether
death,
destruction,
starvation
will
be
taken
care
of
when
the
state
is
doing
that
as
part
of
a
sip
process.
but
that
doesn't
bear
on
how
the
amount
of
significant
contribution
is
defined,
because
when
epa
takes
costs
into
account
it's
not
simply
preventing
the
death
and
destruction
and
starvation.
it's
working
the
other
way,
too.
it's
saying
that,
even
though
a
causation
standard
only
would
require
you
to
reduce
this
much,
we
the
epa
can
shift
to
you
an
additional
burden
because
we
think
another
state
has
already
done
enough.
mr.
peter
keisler
let
me
make
a
distinction
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
which
is
what
the
government
says
is
a
theoretical
possibility
is
simply
whether
a
state
would
be
driven
below
the
1
percent
threshold.
but
what
i'm
saying
really
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
very
first
question,
which
is,
even
apart
from
the
1
percent
threshold,
every
time
they
are
allocating
on
the
basis
of
cost
and
displacing
what
you
would
allocate
on
the
basis
of
what
each
state
actually
contributes,
then
you
are
shifting
burdens
around,
even
apart
from
the
1
percent.
mr.
peter
keisler
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
proper
definition
of
‶
significant
″
when
it's
modifying
‶
contribution
to
nonattainment
″.
mr.
stewart--
mr.
peter
keisler
--we
agree,
your
honor,
and
we
would
emphasize
that
language
as
well.
mr.
peter
keisler
it's
not
a
limitless--
mr.
peter
keisler
--i
don't
think
that
‶
significantly
″
means
that
any
factor
that
might
be
deemed
relevant
in
a
broad
policy
sense
can
be
imported
in.
i
think
when
you
have
a
statute
here
which
talks
about
amounts
that
contribute
significantly
to
nonattainment
or
interfere
with
maintenance--
mr.
peter
keisler
--yes,
and
i
guess
our
position
is
that
significant
may
have
a
range
of
meanings,
but
it's
not
a
limitless
range
of
meanings.
i
think
one
member
of
the
court
once
said
the
fact
that
yellow
is
ambiguous
doesn't
mean
it
can
mean
purple.
and
here,
you
know,
we
don't
think
a
range
of
meanings
in
the
context
of
this
provision
accommodate
the
government's
definition.
mr.
peter
keisler
i
--
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
--
and,
you
know,
i
don't
focus
exclusively
on
the
word
‶
amount
″
or
the
word
‶
significantly
″.
it's
the
entire
phrase,
"amounts
that
contribute
significantly
to
nonattainment
or
interfere
with
maintenance.
"
which
i
do
think
ten
out
of
ten
people
who
weren't
in
this
courtroom
and
hadn't
read
the
clean
air
act,
if
you
sat
down
and
asked
them
what
does
it
mean?
they're
talking
about
what
the
effect
the
emissions
in
one
state
have
on
the
other.
i
don't
think
this
is
any
more
ambiguous
in
referring
to
air
quality
effects
as
a
standard
than
the
naaqs
statute
at
issue
in
american
trucking
was
in
talking
about
safety
and
health
as
a
standard.
it
does
supply
a
content
to
what
the
epa
has
to
do
and
that
content
isn't
cost.
it's
this
air
quality
effect
standard.
mr.
peter
keisler
it's
--
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
translate
the
--
the
amount
concept
into
performance
on
the
basketball
court,
but
mr.
stewart's
other
example
was
a
contribution
to
a
charity.
and
i
certainly
would
accept
the
notion
that
if
bill
gates
and
i
each
contribute
a
hundred
dollars
to
a
charity,
i've
made
the
more
significant
contribution,
but
that's
because
we're
using
‶
contribution
″
in
that
context
to
mean
something
else.
we're
using
it
to
mean
‶
donate
″
or
‶
give
″.
we're
not
using
it
to
talk
about--
mr.
peter
keisler
--but
if
there
were
different
teams
playing
in
the
league
and
you
had
an
overall
result,
you
could
actually
determine,
you
know,
which
team
had
contributed
what
to
the
overall
result.
and
when
we're
dealing
with
states,
we
are
dealing
with
groups
that
the
statute
conceptualizes
as
separate
teams
which
are
entitled
to
be
treated
separately.
but
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
other
point
because
i
see
my
white
light
is
on.
we
have
raised
a
completely
separate
argument.
it's
the
first
argument
in
our
brief,
which
is
independent
of
how
the
court
decides
epa
may
define
the
amount
that
contributes
significantly,
whether
cost
or
air
quality
effects
or
anything
else;
and
that
is
that,
however
it's
defined,
epa
cannot
regulate
beyond
the
point
necessary
to
achieve
attainment
or
maintenance
in
downwind
locations.
and
here,
although
in
the
prior
two
good
neighbor
rulemakings,
it
specifically
said
it
examined
the
issue
and
avoided
overkill.
here,
it
didn't
say
that
because
it
didn't
do
that.
apart
from
the
cost
versus
air
quality
issue,
we
had
commenters
that
submitted
evidence
that
showed
that
epa
could
achieve
attainment
and
maintenance
at
virtually
all
the
same
downwind
locations
at
lower
levels
of
regulation.
and
epa's
response
to
that,
on
pet
app
354(a)
was
they
weren't
going
to
look
at
lower
levels
of
regulation,
because
at
lower
levels
of
regulation,
some
sources
in
some
states
might
cease
operating
existing
controls.
and
that's
all
they
said.
but
if
sources
in
some
states
could
cease
operating
existing
controls
and
as
the
commenter
said,
you
would
still
achieve
attainment
and
maintenance
in
all
the
downwind
locations
that
they
are
linked
to,
then
epa
has
no
authority
under
the
good
neighbor
provision
to
require
those
sources
to
continue
operating
their
existing
controls.
there
may
be
authority
under
other
provisions,
but
not
this
one.
and
the
epa,
in
this
particular
proceeding,
said
nothing
else,
gave
no
other
reason
for
refusing
to
act
on
the
evidence
that
commenters
submitted
that
lower
levels
of
regulation
at
most
upwind
states
would
still
achieve
attainment
and
maintenance
at
downwind
locations,
and
they
had
no
authority
to
regulate
beyond
the
point
necessary
to
achieve
attainment
and
maintenance.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
