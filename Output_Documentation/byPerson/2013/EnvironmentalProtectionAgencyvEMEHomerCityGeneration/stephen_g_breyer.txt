justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
'97.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sir,
i
don't
want
you
to
--
finish
your
argument
if
you
had
something
to
say
on
what
you
started
out
with
in
describing
the
plan.
you
said
there
are
three
aspects.
the
first
aspect
was
you
cut
out
anyone,
any
state
that's
contributing
less
than
1
percent.
you
said
the
second
aspect
was
that
you
used
a
metric
of
$500
per
ton
of
nox
reduced,
and
you
applied
that
to
the
states
still
in.
and
then
you
said
there
were
three,
and
you
never
got
to
three,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
you
do
if
you
had
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
don't
know
exactly
how
to
do
it.
i
mean,
this
is
a
tough
problem.
so
it
sounds
as
if
what
you're
making
is
a
procedural
objection
here
to
which
the
government's
point
was,
you're
right,
we'd
all
been
talking
about
this.
we
wanted
to
see
what
the
states
would
come
up
with,
so
we
look.
the
states
haven't
come
up
with
enough
in
our
opinion;
and
so
now
we
go
to
the
federal
process
and
we
put
out
our
thing.
and
you
comment
on
that.
and
then
if
you
feel
that
their
thing
is
no
good,
propose
your
own
solutions
again.
that's
what
he's
saying.
but
it's
supposed
to
advance
the
ball.
so
there
is
a
procedure
for
the
states
to
come
in
if
they
can
come
up
with
a
better
plan,
that's
what
you've
just
heard,
and
so
do
it.
so
what's
--
what's
arbitrary
or
capricious
about
such
a
system?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
objected
to
it
once.
now
they
think
it
works
here.
i
mean,
all
the
time
it
happens
that
people
change
their
minds
about
how
problems
are
best
solved
or
they
cite
this
problem's
better
solved
one
way
and
better
another
way.
so
if
your
only
point
is
once
they
did
it
a
different
way,
they'll
say,
well,
what's
unreasonable
about
changing
our
way?
we're
trying
to
get
the
job
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
years
and
years,
the
neighbor
board,
the
labor
board
decided
things
in
adjudications,
rules.
one
day
they
say,
no,
we
think
we
should
preside
rulemaking
processes
like
other
agencies.
does
anything
in
the
law
prevent
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
may
not
know,
you
know.
they
may
not
know.
there's
six
states
that
contribute
to
the
seventh
state's
pollution,
and
how
much
each
state
can
cut
back
depends.
it
depends
on
what
it
costs.
it
depends
on
how
much
they
contribute.
it
depends
upon
what
the
other
states
will
do.
it
depends
upon
where
the
wind
blows,
and
that
changes
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
have
a
tough
problem.
they
can't
tell
you
exactly
how
much
you
should
cut
back
until
they
know
what
they
have
in
mind
or
what
others
have
in
mind
for
solving
the
problem.
so
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
you're
asking
them
to
do
the
impossible,
and
they
had
a
very
good
reason
for
not
doing
what
they
did
before;
namely,
it
would
be
impossible
here
to
have
a
--
or
not
actually
impossible,
but
very
tough
and
very
expensive.
so
that's
why,
i
gather,
they
went
the
way
they
did.
i
don't
know
anything
in
the
law
that
tells
them
that
this
statute
was
meant
to
force
them
to
proceed
in
a
way
that
would
either
be
hugely
more
expensive
and
perhaps
impossible.
what's
your
--
what's
your
reaction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
wrong?
that
is,
i
focused
on
your
argument
here
in
the
briefs,
which
is
very
clear
and
very
good.
and
--
and
the
example
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
we
have
an
overgrazing
problem
in
state
a.
all
right?
it's
caused
because
cows
come
in
from
state
b
and
sheep
come
in
from
state
c.
the
cow
men
and
the
sheep
men
are
in
different
states.
they're
not
friends.
[laughter]
now,
it
turns
out
--
it
turns
out
that
epa,
which
is
in
charge
of
preventing
the
overgrazing,
discovers
that
if
the
sheep
men
build
a
fence,
that
will
cure
the
problem,
even
though
they
only
contribute
half
or
maybe
less.
well,
if
we
bury
it
--
you
know,
we
divide
it
equally,
you
each
have
to
pay
--
you
each
have
to
cause
half
the
problem
because
that
seems
fair,
it's
going
to
end
up
that
the
people
in
state
a
with
the
cows,
they're
going
to
starve
to
death.
so
our
choice
is
between
taking
two
people,
two
states,
each
of
whom
cause
half
the
problem
and
getting
an
overall
plan
where
you
solve
the
problem
at
minimal
cost
or
just
dividing
it
50/50,
which
seems
fair
in
mathematics,
but
leads
to
starvation,
cost
and
death,
et
cetera.
do
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
and
that's
what
they've
done
here,
the
second
method.
they
--
rather
the
--
they're
not
treating
each
state
alike,
you
are
right.
and
the
reason
that
they're
not
treating
each
state
alike
is
they
know,
one,
all
the
states
are
partly
responsible
in
more
than
1
percent,
and
with
this
plan,
we
get
the
job
done
at
much
lower
cost.
now,
where
in
the
statute
does
it
say
they
can't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
that
point.
now,
you
remember,
please,
that
--
that
my
cow/sheep
example
was
meant
to
pick
up
precisely
the
disproportion
that
you're
talking
about.
and
--
and
keep
that
in
mind,
because
i
found
it
a
helpful
example.
now,
my
point
is:
did
you
find
in
congress
--
and
i'm
interested
in
legislative
history
--
did
you
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
where
the
epa
faces
this
kind
of
regional
problem,
and
it's
a
regional,
not
just
a
statewide
problem,
that
people
in
congress
thought
they
had
an
answer
or
a
glimmer
of
an
answer
as
opposed
to
taking
this
language
which
is
pretty
open
and
saying
we're
going
to
leave
it
to
--
we
don't
know,
we
don't
have
a
clue.
the
epa
is
there
to
figure
this
thing
out
and
we're
giving
them
the
broad
authority
here.
is
there
anything
that
cuts
on
your
side
that
you
see
as
opposed
to
the
other
side
of
reading
this
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
you're
--
i
mean,
you
want
me
to
write
--
look
what
i
would
have
to
write
if
i
made
it
very
specific.
two
units
floats
over
the
air
from
the
cow
state.
two
units
floats
over
the
air
from
the
sheep
state,
or
three.
it
happens
that
if
we
treat
them
alike
we're
going
to
tell
the
cow
state,
your
unit
is
the
same
as
the
sheep
state's
unit,
both
make
the
same
significant
contribution,
and
we
have
to
say
that
even
if
for
you
to
remit
your
unit
causes
death
and
destruction,
destroys
your
economy.
see,
and
i
have
to
write
those
words
to
accept
your
argument,
don't
i?
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
trying
to
use
the
most
--
i'm
trying
to
use
the
most
extreme
words
i
can
so
that
then
you
will
either
have
to
draw
a
distinction
or
something.
that's
why
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
so
there's
an
ambiguity
here.
because
i
mean,
when
you
use
the
word
‶
amounts
″,
i
think
it
does
help
you.
add
the
word
‶
amounts
″
to
‶
significantly
″
and
i
think
that
justice
scalia's
point
might
be
--
he
knows
it
better
that
i
--
an
amount
is
an
amount.
an
amount
is
an
amount.
that's
what
you
want
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
it
is.
and
then
the
--
the
response
is:
well,
not
always,
because
you
say
an
amount,
you're
talking
about
a
specific
amount
coming
out
of
a
state,
and
is
the
one,
the
cow
one,
as
significant
as
the
sheep
one.
all
right?
and
that's,
i
think,
where
--
i
think
you
hit
the
nail
as
to
what
the
issue
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
in
the
answer
is
that
some
one
point--
