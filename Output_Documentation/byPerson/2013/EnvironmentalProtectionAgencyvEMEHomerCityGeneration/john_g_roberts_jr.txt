chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-1182,
environmental
protection
agency
v.
eme
homer
city
generation
and
the
consolidated
case
american
lung
association
v.
eme
homer
city
generation.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
--
i
was
just
going
to
say,
that
just
is
because
of,
in
the
latter
case,
because
contribution
happens
to
be
used
in
both
an
affirmative
and
a
negative
sense.
the
question
is,
for
example,
whether
somebody
who
fatally
stabs
somebody
and
someone
who
fatally
shoots
them
have
each
significantly
contributed
to
the
bad
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
--
or
not
significantly
contributed
in
--
in
--
contributed
in
varying
degrees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
you
mention
the
fact
that
the
states
didn't
address
the
good
neighbor
requirement,
of
course
you
hadn't
come
up
with
their
budgets
that
they
had
to
meet
at
the
time
that
they
had
to
promulgate
their
sips.
now,
at
a
different
point
in
your
brief
you
emphasize
how
incredibly
complicated
it
is
for
states
to
determine
how
much
they
must
reduce
their
emissions
to
take
care
of
the
fact
that
they
significantly
contributed
to
downwind
pollution.
and
yet
you
would
impose
on
those
states
the
burden
to
issue
the
good
neighbor
program
without
knowing
how
much
you
expect
them
to
--
to
meet.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
were
working
for
one
of
the
upwind
states
and
you
were
facing
this
3-year
deadline
and
epa
had
not
told
anyone
how
it
intended
to
interpret
the
state's
obligations
under
the
good
neighbor
policy,
what
would
you
have
told
the
state
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
--
but
the
head
of
the
state
epa
comes
to
you
and
says:
how
much
do
we
have
to
reduce
our
emissions
to
satisfy
our
requirements?
and
you
would
tell
them
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
kind
of
glosses
over
the
fact
that,
as
you
say
elsewhere
in
your
brief,
this
is
a
--
is
your
analogy,
right
--
a
spaghetti
matrix
or
something?
and
so
there's
no
possible
way
for
the
state
to
know
how
much
of
a
burden
you
expect
them
to
address.
and
yet
you're
saying,
well,
you've
got
to
do
it
and
you've
got
to
do
it
within
3
years,
or
we're
going
to
take
over
the
responsibility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
could
i
address
the
first
thing
first?
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i
think
epa
has
an
easier
job
dealing
with
it
as
a
group.
they
say,
look,
here
are
these
states,
here's
what
you
have
to
do.
but
any
individual
state
has
no
idea
what
its
particular
role
is
going
to
be
in
your
group
resolution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
including
--
including
the
overcontrol
argument,
or
would
that
have
been
done?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mitchell,
why
don't
you
give
us
30
seconds
or
so.
mr.
mitchell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
--
it's
certainly
--
it's
certainly
hard,
but
it
is
what
the
statute
says;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
epa
had
taken
a
different
view,
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mitchell.
mr.
keisler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
what
is
your
answer
--
do
you
have
an
answer
to
mr.
stewart's
basketball
hypothetical?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
was
pretty
good.
if
you
ask
the
coach
what
significantly
contributed
to
the
loss,
he's
going
to
talk
about
the
missed
layup
rather
than
the
missed
desperation
throw,
even
though
as
far
as
amount,
each
was
going
to
count
for
two
points.
assuming
one
was
within
the--

chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
