mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
promulgating
the
transport
rule,
epa
sought
to
protect
the
public
health
and
to
strike
a
fair
balance
between
the
competing
interests
of
upwind
and
downwind
states.
epa's
analysis
proceeded
in
three
basic
steps.
first,
epa
performed
a
screening
analysis
to
determine
which
upwind
states
would
be
covered
by
the
transport
rule.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
epa
first
identified
the
downwind
receptors
that
were
in
a
state
of
nonattainment
or
had
maintenance
difficulties,
and
then
it
determined
which
upwind
states
were
linked
to
those
receptors.
and
in
order
to
be
linked
to
a
downwind
receptor,
the
upwind
state
had
--
had
to
contribute
1
percent
or
more
of
the
relevant
national
air
quality
--
ambient
air
quality
standard,
or
--
or
naaqs,
to
that
downwind
receptor.
and
any
state
that
didn't
contribute
at
least
1
percent
to
any
of
the
downwind
--
any
of
the
relevant
downwind
receptors
was
determined
not
to
contribute
significantly
to
nonattainment
at
that
area.
second,
once
the
states
that
were
to
be
covered
by
the
transport
rule
had
been
identified,
epa
set
a
state
emissions
budget
for
each
state.
and
to
do
that,
it
performed
computer
modeling
to
determine,
in
addition
to
whatever
emission
control
efforts
were
already
going
on,
what
additional
emission
reductions
could
be
achieved
by
implementation
of
control
measures
available
at
various
cost
thresholds;
and
the
thresholds
ultimately
selected
were
for
naaqs,
$500
per
ton.
for
so2,
the
group
1
states
were
at
a
level
of
$2,300
per
ton.
the
group
2
states
were
5
--
$500
per
ton.
and
the
idea
was
let's
see
what
emissions
savings
we
can
achieve
if
additional
control
measures
are
implemented
up
to
those
cost
thresholds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
there
--
there
were
two
bases
for
distinguishing
among
the
states.
the
first
--
in
terms
of
the
$500
per
ton
threshold
for
the
group
2
states
versus
the
$2,300
per
ton
threshold;
the
way
in
which
states
were
divided
into
those
categories
is
that
the
states
that
were
linked
to
the
downwind
receptors
that
had
the
most
severe
pollution
problems
were
treated
as
group
1
states,
and
they
were
required
to
make
greater
pollution
control
efforts
because
they
had
some
responsibility
for
the
most
serious
problems.
now,
i
guess
the
point
of
your
question
would
go
to
--
to
the
fact
that
even
among
states
that
were
operating
under
constant
cost
control
thresholds,
a
state
that
had
already
implemented
cost
measures
up
to
that
limit
might
have
to
do
less
in
a
sense,
because
it
would
have
already
taken
the
--
the
steps
that
were
required,
at
least
as
compared
to
an
air
quality
only
threshold.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
is
--
no,
i
think
it
is
the
case
that
if
you
adopted
an
air
quality
only
threshold,
then
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
the
case
that
states
that
had
already
done
a
lot
to
control
air
pollution
would
have
to
take
additional
steps,
even
if
it
was
done
at
a
non-cost
--
in
a
non-cost-effective
way.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
would
be
the
case
that
at
least
as
--
yes,
as
compared
to
at
least
some
air-quality-only
measures,
the
use
of
cost
would
have
the
effect
of
distributing
the
burden
in
a
somewhat
different
way
than
it
would
have
if
you
considered
air
quality
factors
only.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
that
was
what
i
was
trying
--
trying
to
get
out
earlier.
that
if
--
if
states
have
to
do
less
in
order
to
meet
the
$500
--
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
where
they've
implemented
all
the
cost
--
all
the
emission
control
measures
that
are
available
at
$500
per
ton,
if
a
particular
state
has
to
do
less
in
order
to
achieve
that,
it's
probably
because
that
state
has
already
implemented
most
of
those
measures
on
its
own.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
--
the
term
that
we're--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
statute
says
that
each
state
will
adopt
measures
that
prevent
sources
within
its
borders
from
contributing
significantly
to
downwind
nonattainment.
and
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
not
to
allocate
blame
for
an
existing
state
of
nonattainment
or
for
prior
pollution.
it's
a
device
--
it's
to
devise
a
scheme
that
going
forward
will
prevent
nonattainment
from
occurring.
and
the
idea
is
if
each
state
lives
up
to
its
obligation,
and
if
the
downwind
states
make
commensurate
commitments,
then
the
problem
will
be
solved.
and
in
terms
of
the
language
‶
contribute
significantly
″,
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
various
reasons
to
think
that
epa
reasonably
construed
that
term
to
include
a
component
of
difficulty
of
achievement.
that
is,
in
common
parlance,
we
might
say
that
dunking
a
basketball
is
a
more
significant
achievement
for
somebody
who
is
5
feet
10
than
for
somebody
who
is
6
feet
10.
we
might
say
that
a
$100
charitable
contribution
is
more
significant
if
it's
made
by
a
person
who
makes
$10,000
a
year
than
a
1,000
contribution
by
somebody
who
makes
$1
million
a
year.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
would
say
if
--
if
you
cause
death
by
alternative
means,
then
both
people
would
have
contributed
as
significantly.
but
to
include
--
to
set
out
a
hypothetical
that
involves
contribution
to
a
bad
result,
if
you
had
a
basketball
team
that
lost
a
game
by
one
point,
and
the
coach
was
asked
to
pinpoint
the
plays
that
contributed
significantly
to
the
defeat,
the
coach
would
be
much
more
likely
to
identify
a
missed
layup
or
a
turnover
than
the
missed
half
court
shot
at
the
buzzer.
it's
true
that
the
missed
half-court
shot
at
the
buzzer
would,
in
one
sense,
contribute
significantly,
in
that
it
was
a
but-for
cause.
if
the
shot
had
been
made,
the
outcome
was
--
would
have
been
different.
but
if
you're
talking
about
significant
contributions
to
a
bad
result,
you'd
more
likely
to
focus
on
errors
that
could
or
--
and
should
have
been
avoided,
not
simply
the
failure
to
accomplish
something
that's
extraordinarily
difficult.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
want
to
go
there.
i
think
there's
a
kernel
of
truth
in
there
--
in
that,
but
that
the
point
at
which
the
state's
significant
--
the
point
at
which
the
state's
good
neighbor
obligation
is
triggered
is
by
the
promulgation
of
a
new
national
air
--
ambient
air
quality
standard;
and
the
state
is
required
within
3
years
of
the
promulgation
of
the
naaqs
to
promulgate
a
state
plan
that
includes
good
neighbor
provisions
for
--
for
the
particular--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
this
case,
there
are
two
naaqs
that
were
implemented
--
that
were
promulgated
in
1997.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
one
of
them
for
annual
particulate
matter,
and
one
of
them
for
ozone;
and
then
the
2006
naaqs
was
for
24-hour
particular
matter
--
particulate
matter,
which
is
harder
to
achieve.
and
--
and
so
when
--
when
we
are
asking
what
are
the
states
supposed
to
do
as
of
the
time
that
the
new
naaqs
is
promulgated,
the
states
don't
exactly
get
credit
for
what
they
have
done
in
the
past;
that
is,
they
can't
do
less
than
they
are
supposed
to
do
in
the
future,
simply
because
they
have
done
a
lot
in
prior
years
to
prevent
pollution.
but
the
fact
that
sources
within
the
state
have
in
the
past
installed
various
pollution
control
devices
or
are
using
cleaner
fuels,
that
may
make
it
easier
for
them
to
prevent
significant
contributions
to
downwind
nonattainment
going
forward.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
in
the
case
of
the
naaqs
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
not
the
case
that
requiring
epa
to
establish
the
naaqs
without
reference
to
cause
--
to
cost,
would
call
a
silly
result.
that
is,
the
ambient
air
quality
standards
were
supposed
to
be
set
based
on
public
health
criteria.
and
the
court
in
--
in
the
same
case,
in
american
trucking,
said
that,
of
course,
you
can
consider
costs
in
deciding
what
is
the
most
efficient
and
appropriate
way
to
implement
those
naaqs.
and
here
i
take
your
point
that
in
order
to
conclude
that
congress
barred
consideration
of
costs
at
the
implementation
stage,
we
would
have
to
have
very
clear
language
and
‶
significant
contribution
″
doesn't
do
it.
and
the
other
thing
i
would
say
in
addition
to
the
examples
i've
given
of
--
in
common
parlance,
we
use
significance
to
refer
to
ease
or
difficulty
of
achievement,
it's
worth
emphasizing
that
this
is
a
provision
of
law
and
it's
designed
to
help
allocate
the
responsibility
among
different
actors
for
alleviating
a
shared
problem.
and,
for
example,
suppose--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
we
--
we
can
accept
the
premise
that
each
state
should
alleviate
no
more
than
its
share
and
there
still
may
be
--
that
each
state
should
do
no
more
than
its
share,
and
yet
there
still
may
be
different
ways
of
determining
what
a
state's
fair
share
is.
that
is,
one
way
would
be
to
determine
which
states
had
been
the
greatest
polluters
in
the
past
and
say
that
the
more
pollution
that
had
previously
flowed
from
your
borders,
the
greater
your
reduction
obligation
in
the
future.
but
another
way
would
be
to
say
in
order
to
ensure
that
each
of
the
states
that
have
shared
responsibility
for
the
problem
in
the
past
bears
its
fair
share,
we
will
ask
each
state
to
undertake
commensurate
efforts
as
measured
by
the
cost
threshold.
for
example,
if
it
could
be
shown
somehow
that
the
generation
of
electric
power
inherently
required
the
emission
of
some
level
of
so2
and
nox,
that
there
was
simply
no
way
to
--
to
generate
electricity
through
any
technology
known
today
without
generating
--
without
emitting
that
minimum
amount,
i
think
we
would
certainly
say,
well,
congress
didn't
intend
to
bury
in
the
good
neighbor
provision
some
prohibition
against
particular
states
generating
electricity.
and
epa
could
--
and
epa
or
the
states
could
reasonably
determine
that
the
unavoidable
component
of
the
emissions,
the
part
that
couldn't
be
avoided
even
with
the
best
possible
pollution
control
technology,
that
would
be
regarded
as
legally
insignificant;
that
the
only
legally
significant
contribution
would
be
contribution
that
could
have
been
avoided.
now,
clearly,
epa
has
gone
one
step
farther,
because
it
hasn't
just
focused
on
emissions
that
couldn't
be
avoided
at
all,
at
least
with
--
without
foregoing
the
generation
of
electric
power.
it
has
said,
we
will
treat
as
legally
significant
only
the
extra
increment
of
emissions
that
comes
after
we've
taken
what
we
regard
to
be
equitable
and
cost
effective
pollution
control
measures.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
misspoke.
what
the
court
said
in
american
trucking
is
that
in
--
in
setting
the
naaqs,
epa
was
forbidden
to
consider
cost,
not
because
the
statute
said
in
so
many
words
cost
can't
be
considered,
but
because
the
criteria
that
were
set
out
in
the
statute
for
what
the
naaqs
had
to
achieve
simply
couldn't
be
reconciled
with
consideration
of
costs.
but
the
court
in
the
same
decision
said,
although
you
can't
consider
costs
in
determining
what
the
naaqs
will
be,
what
air
quality
standards
have
to
be
achieved,
of
course
you
can
and
should
consider
costs
in
deciding
what
implementation
measures
should
be
used
to
determine
which
emissions
will
be
reduced.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me
say
three
things
in
response
to
that.
the
first
is
that,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
good
neighbor
provision
is
addressed
in
the
first
instance
to
the
states.
that
is,
it's
the
state's
initial
obligation
to
submit
an
implementation
plan
that
contains
good
neighbor
provisions.
and
so
if
the
court
says
costs
can't
be
considered
in
defining
significant
contribution,
the
effect
is
not
simply
that
epa
can't
consider
that
factor
when
it
steps
into
the
state's
shoes.
the
effect
is
that
a
state
can't
consider
cost
of
achievement
in
attempting
in
good
faith
to
implement
its
own
good
neighbor
provision.
the
second
thing
i
would
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
good
neighbor
provision
--
we're
dealing
here
with
a
situation
where
epa
was
the
one
that
promulgated
federal
implementation
plans,
but
that's
only
because
the
states
didn't
--
the
relevant
upwind
states
did
not
discharge
their
obligation
to
implement
state
--
promulgate
state
implementation
plans
that
contain
good
neighbor
provisions.
but
the
language
‶
contribute
significantly
″
is
in
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
deals
with
what
a
state
plan
is
supposed
to
contain.
it's
not
dealing
with
--
it's
not
in
a
provision
that
by
its
terms
is
addressed
directly
to
epa.
and
so
if
the
court
said
in
defining
‶
contribute
significantly
″
we
can't
take
into
account
the
cost
of
emission
control
measures,
that
would
mean
not
simply
that
epa
can't
consider
that
factor
when
it
steps
into
the
state's
shoes;
it
would
also
mean
that
the
state
can't
consider
that
factor.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
it's
the
statute
that
imposes
the
obligation
on
the
states.
and
it
may
help
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
relevant
provisions.
on
page
1a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
opening
brief,
the
relevant
provision
is
32
u.s.c.
7410.
and
7410(a)(1)
begins
by
saying:
"each
state
shall,
after
reasonable
notice
and
public
hearings,
adopt
and
submit
to
the
administrator
of
epa
within
3
years
or
such
shorter
period
as
the
administrator
may
prescribe
after
the
promulgation
of
a
national
primary
ambient
air
quality
standard,
the
naaqs.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"a
plan
which
provides
for
implementation,
and
so
forth.
"
and
then
if
you
look
to
the
bottom
of
--
or
to
the
top
of
page
2a
--
i'm
sorry
--
subsection
(2)
begins:
"each
implementation
plan
submitted
by
a
state
under
this
chapter
shall
be
adopted
by
the
state
after
reasonable
notice
and
public
hearing.
"
"each
such
plan
shall.
"
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
it
says,
"contain
adequate
provisions
prohibiting,
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter,
any
source
or
other
type
of
emissions
activity
within
the
state
from
emitting
any
air
pollution
in
amounts
which
will
contribute
significantly
to
nonattainment--
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
certainly
epa's
basic
methodology
of
using
--
using
cost
thresholds
had
been
embodied
in
the
--
the
naaqs
sip
call
in
1998
and
in
care,
which
i
believe
was
promulgated
in
2006.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
tell
them,
in
all
honesty,
we
don't
know
yet.
but
that
--
that's
not
a
fatal
flaw
in
the
argument.
that
is,
it
is
inherent
in
any
legal
context
in
which
one
person
acts
and
then
a
second
person
reviews,
that
the
first
person
has
to
act
before
the
second
person
has
--
has
made
up
his
or
her
mind.
and
so
a
district
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
certainly
what
epa
was
called
upon
to
do
was
far
more
complicated
than
what
any
particular
state
was
going
to
be
called
upon
to
do,
because
as
a
result
of
widespread
noncompliance,
epa
was
promulgating
federal
implementation
plans
for
close
to
30
states
and
plans
for
--
for
different
naaqs.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
certainly
has
the
data
available
to
it
that
--
that
epa
had
available
about
how
much
did
each
state
contribute
to
the
overage
at
various
nonattainer
--
nonattainment
receptors
in
the
past.
it's
certainly
true
that
the
states
wouldn't
necessarily
know
exactly
what
policy
judgment
epa
would
ultimately
make
as
to
what
the
right
cost
threshold
was.
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
second
--
the
other
two
points
i
would
make
are:
first,
the
state's
role
is
to
devise
something,
in
this
area
as
in
others,
that
it
believes
will
carry
out
its
own
legal
obligations,
not
necessarily
to
predict
just
how
epa
would
do
it
if
the
task
fell
to
epa.
and
so,
for
example,
when
the
states
are
undertaking
a
more
--
the
more
prosaic
task
of
devising
plans
that
will
produce
attainment
of
the
naaqs
within
their
own
borders,
they
have
to
make
a
variety
of
policy
judgments
about
the
right
mix
of
emission
controls,
what
sources
should
be
allowed
to
emit
in
--
in
what
amounts.
if
a
particular
state
just
didn't
do
it,
that
task
would
fall
to
epa.
and
it's
very
unlikely
that
anything
the
particular
state
would
come
up
with
would
exactly
match
what
epa
would
ultimately
devise.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
examples
i
would
point
to
are
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
--
the
respondent
states
that
are
on
our
side
of
the
case,
who
identify
examples
of
instances
where
states
did
successfully
comply
with
their
good
neighbor
obligations
and
--
and
persuaded
epa
that
what
they
had
done
was
enough.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
characterize
what
epa
is
doing
as
hiding
the
ball;
that
is,
it
didn't
kind
of
fail
to
divulge
information
that
it
had
its
--
at
it's
disposal.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
released
a
great
deal
of
information
at
the
time
that
the
proposed
rule
was
announced
in
the
--
the
summer
of
2010.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
--
but
i
take
your
point
that
--
the
two
additional
things
i
would
say,
though,
are
that
for
better
or
worse
congress
did
place
this
obligation
on
the
states.
it
evidently
thought
that,
at
least
in
the
mine
run
of
states
--
of
cases,
states
were
capable
of
carrying
out
this
task.
and
at
least
to
the
extent
that
adopting
a
good
--
a
good
neighbor
provision
requires
consideration
of
circumstances
in
other
states,
in
a
sense
this
is
just
the
flip
side
of
what
the
downwind
states
have
to
do
all
the
time.
that
is,
if
new
york
officials
are
trying
to
determine
when
a
new
naaqs
comes
out,
how
can
we
bring
our
own
air
quality
into
compliance?
what
controls
do
we
have
to
place
on
our
own
sources
in
order
to
get
air
quality
to
the
desired
level?
the
new
york
officials
have
to
take
account
of
the
degree
of
pollution
that
is
likely
to
travel
to
their
borders
from
other
states.
they
can't
analyze
emissions
within
their
own
borders
in
a
vacuum.
they
have
to
consider
what
the
likely
contributions
of
their
neighbors--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
the
final
thing
i
would
say
on
--
on
this
part
of
the
--
this
particular
sub-issue
of
the
case
is
that,
even
if
you
reach
that
conclusion,
even
if
you
determine
that
it
was
just
practically
infeasible
for
any
state
to
adopt
a
compliant
state
implementation
plan
with
good
neighbor
provisions
for
these
naaqs
until
epa
acted,
then
the
proposition
of
the
opposing
states
still
wouldn't
follow.
that
is,
the
statute
in
the
provisions
that
i've
pointed
to
says
it's
up
to
the
states
in
the
first
instance
to
devise
the
state
implementation
plans,
including
good
neighbor
provisions.
and
then
on
page
10a
of
the
same
provision
--
of
the
same
appendix,
i'm
sorry
--
the
statute
describes
what
happens
if
a
state
fails
to
satisfy
that
obligation.
and
this
is
at
the
beginning
of
subsection
(c)(1)
on
page
10a.
it
says:
"the
administrator
shall
promulgate
a
federal
implementation
plan
at
any
time
within
2
years
after
the
administrator
finds
that
a
state
has
failed
to
make
a
required
submission
or
finds
that
the
plan
or
plan
revision
submitted
by
the
state
does
not
satisfy
the
minimum
criteria.
"
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
in
the
circumstance
you
describe,
if
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
theoretical
possibility
that
this
could
happen
and
that
it
would
be
a
problem
if
it
did,
but
that
the
methodology
used
by
epa
was
on
the
whole
rational,
i
think
the
task
for
the
court
at
this
stage
of
the
case
is
to
rule
on
the
more
big
picture
objections
that
are
properly
before
it
and
--
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on.
now,
even
if
we
win
everything
that's
at
issue
in
this
court,
the
case
is
not
over.
there
are
a
variety
of
more
specific
challenges
to
the
details
of
the
rule
that
the
d.c.
circuit
found
it
unnecessary
to
address.
and
so
if
we
won
on
the
issues
that
are
before
the
court,
the
case
would
be
remanded
and
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
the
court
below
to
consider
those.
and
to
the
extent--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
to
--
to
the
extent
that
any
state
had
--
and
i
don't
know
the
--
the
pending
as-applied
challenges
at
this
level
of
detail.
but
to
the
extent
that
any
state
has
a
properly
preserved
challenge
to
the
effect
that
it
is
actually
likely
to
be
subject
to
overcontrol,
then
that
could
be
heard
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
could
determine
both
whether
that
is,
in
fact,
likely
to
happen
and
whether,
if
it
does
happen,
that
would
render
the
rule
arbitrary
and
capricious
as
to
that
state.
but
the
--
the
real
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals
methodology
was
that
it
said
the
fact
that
epa
can't
absolutely
rule
out
the
possibility
that
it
might
happen
renders
the
rule
invalid
on
its
face,
and
in
other
portions
of
the
opinion
the
court
faulted
epa
for
failing
to
ensure
that
its
regime
would
not
lead
to
overcontrol.
and
i
think
that's
an
extraordinary
standard
for
an
administrative
agency
to
deal
with;
that
is,
you
know,
it
happens
all
the
time
that
federal
agencies
are
given
authority
to
regulate,
to
address
one
problem,
and
the
regulation
necessarily
has
spillover
effects
on
other
conduct.
and
so
for
instance,
if
a
federal
agency
was
tasked
with
preventing
the
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
contaminated
food,
it
might
require
inspections.
it
might
require
the
recall
of
food
after
one
item
in
a
shipment
had
been
shown
to
be
contaminated.
these
measures
might
have
spillover
effects
on
food
that
was
not,
in
fact,
contaminated.
but
that
wouldn't
be
a
flaw
in
the
rule.
of
course,
an
agency
could
go
overboard
and
impose
a
regime
that
was
so
onerous
in
comparison
to
the
health
benefits
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
but
nobody
would
ever
say
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
agency
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
other
means
of
achieving
the
same
health
benefits
at
lower
cost
to
the
public.
the
other
thing
that
the
states
could
do,
i
mentioned
that
one
way
in
which
a
state
that
believed
itself
to
be
unfairly
or
inappropriately
treated
by
the
rule
was
to
pursue
any
adequately
preserved
legal
challenge
it
may
have
in
the
judicial
proceedings.
and
as
your
question
indicated,
there
is
also
a
mechanism
by
which
a
state
can
ask
to
have
the
federal
implementation
plan
replaced
by
a
plan
of
its
own
devising.
and
so
the
consequence
of
the
state's
failure
to
achieve
their
good
neighbor
obligations
in
time
and
epa's
stepping
into
their
shoes,
that
--
the
consequence
was
not
that
they're
forever
barred
from
devising
their
own
plans.
the
consequence
was
simply
that
the
federal
implementation
plan
would
remain
in
effect
for
a
fairly
limited
period
of
time
subject
to
replacement
by
a
state
plan.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
have
an
estimate
on
the
time,
but
if
the
court
affirms
on
the
ground
that
epa
may
not
consider
costs
--
part
of
the
problem,
i
think
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
undertaking
for
epa
to
try
to
achieve.
that
is,
part
of
the
difficulty
here
is
that
nobody
has
identified
a
concrete
alternative;
that
is,
a
plan
that
would
not
consider
costs
and
that
--
yet
that
would
disperse
the
burdens
of
compliance
among
the
states
in
proportion
to
their
prior
contributions
and
also
would
address
the
nonattainment
problem
at
all
of
the
downwind
receptors.
i
don't
know
if
it's
could
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--what
--
at
least
what
we
understand
to
be
the
straight
proportionality
approach
is
impossible.
that
is,
it
might
be
possible
with
respect
to
any
particular
downwind
receptor,
because
you
could
say
that
if
one
upwind
state
is
contributing
two
units
and
another
four
and
another
seven,
the
proportional
solution
might
be
to
require
that
any
necessary
reduction
would
be
in
those
proportions.
one
state
would
do
2/13ths
of
the
reduction,
another
would
do
4/13ths
of
the
reduction
and
another
would
do
7/13ths
of
the
reduction.
that
would
be
theoretically
possible
with
respect
to
any
receptor.
but
with
respect
to
another
receptor,
the
same
states
might
be
contributing
in
entirely
different
proportions,
and
so
there
would
be
no
way
of
devising
a
solution
that
would
be
proportionate
as
to
both.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
you
might
be
able
to
average
them
out.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
the
cost
threshold
was
not
to
increase
or
decrease
the
total
amount
of
reductions
that
would
be
necessary.
it
would
be
to
ensure
that
the
reductions
that
had
to
take
place
were
done
in
the
most
cost-effective
manner
possible.
and
part
of
the
irony--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
cost
methodology
is
one
that
epa
had
used
often
in
the
past.
indeed,
even
before
the
term
‶
contribute
significantly
″
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1990,
epa
had
interpreted
the
prior
reading
of
the
statute
to
allow
relief
for
a
downwind
state
if
an
upwind
state
was
contributing
significantly
to
downwind
pollution,
and
it
had
interpreted
that
standard
as
allowing
consideration
of
cost
and
compliance
burdens.
i
mean,
one
of
the
ironic
things
about
this
case
is
that
the
only
ill
consequence
of
overcontrol
is
cost.
that
is,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
there
is
some
distinct
public
health
benefit
--
distinct
public
health
problem,
i'm
sorry,
that
is
caused
if
power
plants
are
emitting
too
little
nox
or
so2.
the
only
reason
that
people
worry
about
overcontrol,
about
reducing
emissions
more
than
they
need
to
be,
is
that
it
costs
money.
and
if
that's
the
problem
to
be
avoided,
it
seems
strange
that
epa
can't
take
account
of
costs
in
theorizing
a
solution.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
third
part
of
the
process
is
that
once
each
state's
emissions
budget
has
been
quantified,
with
respect
to
each
state
the
epa
essentially
divides
up
the
emissions
that
are
allowed
among
the
different
power
plants
within
the
state's
borders.
and
the
way
that
it
does
that
is
it
gives
allowances
to
the
various
power
plants
that
add
up
to
the
total
number
of
tons
of
pollutants
that
are
allowed
to
be
emitted.
and
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
states
have
not
joined
the
industry's
argument
here
that
cost
--
even
the
states
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
have
not
joined
the
industry's
argument
here
that
states
that
costs
can't
be
considered.
those
states
are
not
quarreling
with
the
methodology
by
which
epa
quantified
their
state
emission
budgets.
those
states
are
simply
saying
that
once
those
had
been
quantified
they
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
determine
on
their
own
how
the
allowances
should
be
allocated
without
epa
doing
it
first.
in
some
situations
that
might
have
been
a
rational
way
for
epa
to
proceed.
that
is,
the
statute
says
that
once
the
--
once
epa
finds
that
a
particular
state
has
either
failed
to
submit
a
good
neighbor
sip
or
has,
or
epa
has
disapproved
the
good
neighbor
sip,
once
that
happens,
the
statute
says
that
epa
at
any
time
within
2
years
can
promulgate
its
own
federal
implementation
plan.
and
in
some
circumstances,
it
might
be
rational
for
epa
to
wait
the
full
2
years
and
give
additional
guidance
to
states
in
order
to
give
them
every
opportunity
to
devise
compliance
plans.
there
were
basically
two
reasons
that
epa
didn't
do
that
here.
the
first
is
that
it
was
subject
to
the
d.c.
circuit's
mandate
in
north
carolina,
which
said
get
something
in
place
that
works
as
soon
as
possible.
and
epa
felt
constrained
by
that
to
act
as
quickly
as
it
could.
and
the
second
point
worth
emphasizing
is
that
there
are
state
sovereign
interests
on
both
sides
of
the
case.
it's
true
that
by
devising
a
federal
plan
in
the
first
instance
epa
has
intruded
to
a
degree
on
the
ability
of
the
upwind
states
to
decide
how
emissions
allowances
should
be
allocated
among
their
own
sources.
but
the
downwind
states
are
subject
to
their
own
obligations
to
comply
with
the
naaqs
within
their
own
borders,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
can't
get
relief
from
the
upwind
states
their
task
is
made
more
difficult.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
i
mean,
with
respect
to
the
particular
naaqs
that
are
at
issue
here,
the
states
--
it's
unclear
to
what
extent
they've
been
working
on
this
in
the
interim,
but
the
states
certainly
could,
even
under
the
terms
of
the
transport
rule,
propose
state
implementation
plans
to
replace
the
fips.
now,
it's
to
be
contemplated
that
there
will
be
additional
naaqs
implemented,
and
this
court's
decision
would
affect
the
way
in
which
both
the
states
and
epa
went
about
the
business
of
determining
how
good
neighbor
obligations
should
be
carried
out
with
respect
to
those
future
naaqs.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
mr.
keisler
indicated,
in
our
reply
brief
we
cited
the
history
of
the
restatement
as
it
bears
on
the
common
law
of
nuisance.
and
as
this
court
indicated
in
american
electric
power,
if
the
clean
air
act
had
not
been
enacted,
the
remedy
that
downwind
states
would
have
in
a
situation
like
this
one
would
be
a
federal
common
law
nuisance
suit
against
upwind
states
or
polluters
in
upwind
states.
and
i
think
there
are
three
lessons
to
draw
from
that
fact.
the
first
is
that,
as
the
briefs
and
argument
in
this
case
indicate,
judicial
resolution
of
such
a
suit
would
have
been
a
herculean
task.
and
the
prospect
of
doing
that
through
judicial
processes
should
reinforce
the
wisdom
of
congress's
choice
to
replace
that
mechanism
with
the
clean
air
act,
and
it
counsels
in
favor
of
deference
to
the
expert
agency
that
has
been
placed
in
the
position
that
a
common
law
court
would
previously
have
been
placed
in.
the
second
is
that,
as
the
reply
brief
citation
to
the
law
of
nuisance
indicates,
the
common
law
court
in
that
scenario
would
have
been
able
to
consider
the
costs
necessary
to
achieve
reduction
in
pollution
upwind
in
deciding
whether
a
particular
remedy
would
be
appropriate
or
how
much
of
a
reduction
an
upwind
polluter
should
have
to
make.
and
there's
no
reason,
absent
extraordinarily
clear
statutory
language,
to
deny
epa
the
same
authority.
the
third
thing
is,
as
the
analogy
to
the
common
law
suit
indicates,
there
are
sovereign
state
interests
on
both
sides
of
this
case.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
epa
versus
the
states.
it's
a
matter
of
epa
trying
to
act
as
an
honest
broker
between
the
upwind
and
downwind
states.
the
next
thing
i
would
say
about
the
clean
air
act
is
that
the
statute
as
a
whole
is
replete
with
references
to
economic
activity
and
harnessing
the
profit
motive.
that
is,
both
the
states
and
epa
are
specifically
authorized
to
provide
for
the
trading
of
allowances,
the
whole
purpose
of
which
is
to
achieve
emission
reductions
in
the
most
cost-effective
manner
possible.
and
i
think
it's
worth
noting
in
this
regard
that,
although
we
talk
about
the
transport
rule
as
regulating
the
emission
of
--
emissions
of
states,
what
we're
really
regulating
is
emissions
of
power
plants
within
the
states,
and
the
good
neighbor
provision
itself
talks
about
preventing
significant
contribution
from
emissions
sources
or
emissions
activity
within
the
states.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
epa
said
in
the
proposed
rulemaking
was
that
in
some
circumstances
the
cumulative
downwind
impact
of
a
particular
upwind
state
might
be
great,
not
because
any
particular
power
plant
was
poorly
regulated
or
emitting
at
a
high
level,
but
because
there
were
so
many
power
plants
in
the
same
state.
and
one
consequence
of
forbidding
the
epa
to
consider
costs
is
that
a
particular
power
plant
in
an
upwind
state
might
be
required
to
install
more
expensive
pollution
control
measures
and
make
greater
reductions
simply
because
it
happened
to
be
located
in
a
state
with
a
lot
of
other
power
plants.
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is
this
is
--
the
statute,
as
i've
said
before,
has
prospective
focus.
it's
intended
to
be
implemented
by
state
officials,
and
if
you
ask
how
would
a
state
official
assure
herself
or
feel
confident
that
her
own
state
implementation
plan
was
satisfying
good
neighbor
obligations
when
she
wasn't
really
sure
what
other
states
might
be
doing,
and
one
way
is
if
a
state
official
said,
if
everybody
else
did
what
i'm
doing
i
can
feel
confident
that
the
problem
would
be
solved.
and
that's
really
the
approach
that
epa
used.
it
examined
certain
cost
thresholds
and
it
said:
at
particular
cost
thresholds
we
feel
confident
that
if
everyone,
upwind
and
downwind
states
alike
--
alike
makes
pollution
control
efforts
at
these
levels,
the
problem
will
be
solved
or
at
least
almost
solved,
because
there
would
still
be
slight
residual
nonattainment.
and
it
seems
perfectly
rational
to
say
that
the
significant
contribution
is
the
amount
over
and
above
what
would
occur
if
everyone
adhered
to
an
approach
which,
if
applied
across
the
board,
would
solve
the
problem.
thank
you.
