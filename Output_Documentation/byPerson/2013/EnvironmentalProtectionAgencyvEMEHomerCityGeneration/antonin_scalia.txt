justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
those
--
those
savings
would
--
would
not
be
evenly
distributed
among
the
upwind
states,
right?
so
some
upwind
states
that
are
able
to
make
those
efficient
changes
will
be
carrying
more
than
their
burden
of
reducing
the
emissions
that
affect
downwind
states,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
mind
a
state
doing
less.
i
think
north
carolina
said
--
said
that
you
can
use
those
cost
figures
to
do
less,
and
that's
not
challenged
here.
but
what
the
application
of
the
cost
factor
means
is
that
some
states
that
can
more
efficiently
make
the
changes
will
be
required
to
do
more
than
merely
account
for
their
proportion
of
the
downwind
harm.
isn't
that
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
i
mean,
i
think
it's
an
easy
yes
or
no
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
you
answered
my
question?
does
--
does
--
does
the
fact
that
you
begin
with
what
the
statute
says
is
each
upwind
state
has
to
account
for
its
--
its
effect
on
the
downwind
states,
but
once
having
identified
that
effect,
you
--
you
then
say
those
upwind
states
that
can
make
the
reductions
more
efficiently
have
to
make
more
reductions
than
they
--
than
their
mere
proportion
of
the
harm
requires.
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
provision
of
the
statute
allows
you
to
take
that
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
as
opposed
to
each
state,
whether
it's
inefficient
or
efficient,
has
to
merely
reduce
its
contribution
to
the
downwind
state
pollution;
right?
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is
that
that
allocation
among
different
actors
is
done
state
by
state,
and
simply
taking
costs
into
account
as
determining
who
will
do
what
simply
eliminates
the
requirement
that
each
state
not
be
--
not
be
required
to
do
more
than
its
share
of
the
pollution
it's
--
it's
causing
downstream.
it's
the
state-by-state
requirement
that
makes
it
very
difficult
to
think
that
all
congress
wanted
was
the
most
efficient
reduction
of
pollution
no
matter
where
that
pollution
came
from.
that's
simply
not
what
the
statute
envisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
that'd
be
a
better
statute.
maybe
it
shouldn't
be
state
by
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
congress
wanted
that,
why
couldn't
congress
simply
have
said
the
epa
shall
prescribe
minimum
pollution
reduction
measures
that
have
to
be
taken
by
the
states?
that's
a
quite
different
statute
from
what
we
have
before
us.
but
what
you're
saying
is,
you
know,
you
--
you
reduce
it
this
--
this
much,
as
much
as
efficiency
will
allow,
or
else
you're
in
violation
of
--
of
the
good
neighbor
rule.
and
that's
a
very
different
statute
from
what
congress
wrote.
maybe
it's
a
good
idea.
maybe
epa
ought
to
control
all
--
all
efficiency
measures
for
reducing
pollution,
but
it's
certainly
not
the
statute
that
congress
wrote.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand
that.
please
say
that
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that's
crucial.
i
mean,
it
would
have
no
idea
whether
epa
would
use
any
or
would
pick
$500
or
would
pick
whatever.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
it
could
sensibly
design
a
--
a
program
without
knowing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
when
epa
has
done
this
in
the
past,
where
a
--
a
crucial
element
of
a
--
of
a
naaqs
has
not
been
defined
by
the
agency
and
yet
the
agency
nonetheless
requires
the
states
to
--
to
put
together
their
sips
without
knowing
what
their
target
is?
and
that's
the
problem
here.
what's
your
best
example
of
another
case
in
which
the
agency
said,
you
--
you
put
together
a
sip
and
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
what
the
target
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
just
means
it's
pin
the
tail
on
the
donkey.
some
states
got
the
tail.
i
mean,
you
know,
they
pinned
it
in
the
right
place.
that
doesn't
prove
anything.
i
want
an
example
of
another
instance
in
which
epa
has
--
has
hidden
the
ball,
has
said,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
what
the
target
is;
it's
up
to
you
to
come
up
--
up
with
a
sip
and
we'll
tell
you
after
the
fact
whether
that
sip
happened
to
meet
the
target
that
we've
invented.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that
just
means
there's
some
facts
that
they
don't
know.
of
course.
there
is
always
going
to
be
uncertainty
about
certain
facts.
but
here
there
is
uncertainty
about
the
target,
not
just
about
the
facts.
we
don't
know
what
target
we're
expected
to
hit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
average
them
out,
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
any
more
irrational
then
picking
a
number
like
500
bucks
as
--
as
to,
you
know,
what
the
--
who
can
do
it
more
efficiently.
that's
sort
of
arbitrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
my
point
is
that
is
certainly
a
pretty
--
pretty
arbitrary
number,
and
--
and
i
think
averaging
for
all
the
receptors
is
certainly
no
more
arbitrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask,
until
you
propose
your
sip
to
replace
the
fip,
right,
the
fip
remains
in
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
bound
by
that
until
they
approve
your
new
sip.
how
long
does
such
a
transaction
normally
take?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
a
quick
process?
i
mean
as
soon
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you'll
have
to
develop
a
new
sip,
that'll
take
you
some
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
that
sip
is
--
is
submitted
to
epa,
and
--
and
they
chew
on
it
for
as
long
as
they
want,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
maybe
they
will
say
your
sip
is
good
enough,
and
maybe
they
won't.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
means
the
statute
doesn't
require
you
to
do
that,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
when
they
say
that,
that
--
that's
an
affirmation
by
them
that
the
statute
does
not
require
you
to
do
it,
i
assume.
is
that
your
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
have
done
the
impossible
here,
haven't
they?
i
mean,
they
have
the
transport
rule.
that's
--
the
only
question
is
whether
it
should
have
come
out
sooner
or
later,
right?
the
only
question
is
whether
it
should
have
come
out
before
the
states
were
obliged
to
submit
their
sips.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
started
to
give
us
a
second
statutory
reason.
i
was
really
eager
to
see
what
that
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
finish
describing
the
issue?
i
really
didn't
hear
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
--
it
think
it
would
follow
that
if
you
did
it
for
good
cause
to
--
to
apply
the
rule,
you
can
do
it
for
good
cause
to
abolish
it.
not
that
you
can
do
it
by
rulemaking
when
you
adopt
it
and
then
used
good
cause
when
you
--
when
you
abolish
it.
it
would
seem
to
me
to
square
with
the
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
same
manner?
justice
antonin
scalia
amounts
significantly
attribute,
right?
it's
--
it's
amounts.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
not
conduct
significantly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
contributions
to
nonattainment.
it's
the
word
‶
amounts
″.
the
statute
prohibits
activity
within
the
state
from
emitting
any
air
pollutant
in
amounts
which
will
contribute
significantly.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
amounts
are
amounts.
i
mean,
it
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
my
point
exactly.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
basketball
thing
is
--
to
make
it
parallel
to
what's
at
issue
here,
the
question
you
should
ask
the
coach,
which
--
which
of
the
--
you
lost
101
to
100.
which
of
the
101
points
contributed
most
to
your
loss?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
the
one
that
was
the
layup.
i
mean,
he
would
not
answer
the
one
that
was
the
layup.
he'd
say
what
do
you
mean?
all
--
all
of
101.
