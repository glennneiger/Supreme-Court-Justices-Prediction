either
then
or
now,
were
the

benefit
payments
subject
to

or
are
they
now
exempt
under
the
present--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
after
(o)
was
passed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
obviously
subject
to
federal
income
tax
withholding.
what
about
fica?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
and
is
that
still
true
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
ever
to
the
long-term
advantage
to
the
employee
to
have
fica
withholding,
so
that
the
employee's
account
is
greater
and
the
