mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
--
the
government
agrees
that
some
sub
payments
are
not
wages.
where
the
dispute
lies
is
what
sub
payments
are
covered
by
fica
and
which
are
not.
if
the
payments
meet
the
definition
of
sub
payment
under
the
statute,
then
they
are
not
wages
and
not
subject
to
fica.
the
government's--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--supplemental
unemployment
benefits.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
the
government
says
they
are
now
wages
if
they
meet
the
definition
as
they
particularly
see
it
in
a
particular
revenue
ruling
that
they
issue
at
some
point
in
time;
and
that's
where
the
dispute
lies.
it
is
our
position
that
sub
payments
is
not
remuneration
for
services
because
it
is
contingent,
as
indicated
previously
on
the
coffy
case,
upon
losing
your
job.
there
is
a
problem
on
the
public
policy
issue
that
the
government
is
telling
the
court
today,
and
the
problem
is
if
what
they
say
is
sub
pay
is
tied
to
state
unemployment
benefits,
then
it
is
not
wages
and
subject
to
fica.
they
say
if
it's
--
if
you
receive
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
but
you
do
not
receive
state
unemployment,
then
it
is
subject
to
fica
taxes
and
is
wages.
so,
what
they
are
saying
to
the
court
is
if
you
have
the
ability
to
receive
both
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
and
the
state
unemployment
benefits,
then
we
are
not
going
to
tax
you
with
fica
taxes,
but
if
you
only
receive
less,
being
just
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefits,
then
it
is
going
to
be
wages
and
then
it's
going
to
be
subject
to
fica
taxes.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
yes.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
the
statute
is
clear.
when
you
look
at
the
definition
of
fica
statute
and
the
withholding
statute,
they
are
almost
identical.
and
if
you
look
at
the
rowan
case,
the
rowan
case
says
that
you
should
read
the
statutes
consistently
for
ease
of
administration.
it
is
clear--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--pardon
me?
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
well,
what
they
are
withholding
on
the
withholding
is
income
taxes.
they
are
not
withholding
wages.
and
that's
why
--
because
it
doesn't
fit
the
definition
of
wages.
if
you
look
at
3121,
which
is
the
fica
statute,
supplemental
unemployment
benefit
is
not
remuneration
for
services.
they're
only--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--your
honor,
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
provided
to
an
individual
to
provide
a
safety
net
when
they
lose
their
job,
to
cover
them
during
the
period
while
they
seek
new
employment.
to
then
tax
the
individual
with
fica
taxes
doesn't
make
sense,
because
you
are
taking
away
the
money
that
the
individual
needs
as
a
safety
net;
and
to
take
money
away
in
order
to
provide
for
the
funding
of
medicare
or
social
security
doesn't
make
sense.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
no,
what
they're
doing
is
they're--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--they
are
putting
in
place
a
plan
in
order
to
protect
the
employee
in
the
event
of
a
layoff
or
a
plant
closing.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
your
honor,
fica
purposes;
but
we
believe
the
definition
is
different
for
supplemental
unemployment
benefits.
under
--
dismissal
payments
are
for
involuntary
termination.
it
can
be
because
of
a
firing
or
a
cancellation
of
an
employment
contract,
where
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
based
upon
a
plan
and
are
given
to
an
individual
because
of
a
plant
closing
or
a
layoff.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
no.
and
the--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--the
reason
is
that
because,
if
you
look
at
how
they
are
treated,
even
the
government
acknowledges
that
some
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
now
wages.
and
if
you
look
as
far
back
as
1960,
when
501(c)(17)
was
enacted
dealing
with
trusts
and
their
exemption
from
the
taxes,
the
definition
of
"supplemental
unemployment
benefits"
has
always
had
its
own
definition.
and
it's
always
been
treated
--
in
1977,
for
example,
the
revenue
ruling
that
the
government
issued
said
that
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
of
any
kind
are
not
--
are
not
--
wages
and
subject
to
fica.
in
1986
congress
reenacted
the
withholding
statute
and
the
fica
statute
with
the
knowledge
that
1977
revenue
ruling
was
in
place;
and
therefore,
it's
presumed
that
fica
taxes
are
not
--
or
that
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
not
subject
to
fica
taxes.
the
government
has
stipulated
that
the
payments
made
in
this
case
to
the
quality
stores
employees
met
the
definition
of
supplemental
unemployment
benefits.
and
as
i
began
to
indicate,
the
rowan
case
said
that
you
should
read
statutes
consistently
and
for
ease
of
administration.
when
you
look
at
3121,
being
the
fica
statute,
along
with
3401,
the
definition
of
"wages"
is
almost
identical.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
well,
if
sub--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--if
sub
pay
was
wages,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
pass
3402.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
well--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--well--
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
--i
don't
think
you
can,
based
upon
when
you
look
at
what
the
statute
says,
3402(o).
it
says
that
they
should
be
treated
as
if
they
are
wages.
if
they
were
already
wages,
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
of
treating
them
if
they
were
wages.
if
you
also
look
at
the
title
of
the
section,
it
says
"other
than
wages".
it's
clear
that
if
it
was
wages,
they
wouldn't
use
the
word
"other
than
wages".
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
also,
it
says
in
three
different
places
that
they're
not
wages
and
also
indicates
it's
not
remuneration
for
services.
so
the
reason
that
3402(o)
was
enacted
was
because
of
the
1968
treasury
regulation
that
had
the
reporting
of
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
on
a
1099
form.
that's
clearly
not
a
wage
form.
if
it's
wages,
you
report
on
a
w-2.
so
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
enactment
of
3402(o)
if
they
were
already
wages.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
your
honor,
dismissal
payments
are
involuntary
termination.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
yes.
and
there
--
and
that
also
is
the
beginning
part
of
when
you
look
at
sub
payments.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
all
involuntary
terminations.
but
that's
where
they
differ
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
no,
they're
--
they're
involuntary
payments,
also,
or
based
upon
involuntary
termination.
the
difference
is
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
paid
pursuant
to
a
plan,
and
they
are
also
based
upon
a
layoff
or
a
plant
closing.
and
a
dismissal
payment,
for
example,
which
is
a
separate
category,
and
treated
separately
in
the
treasury
regulations,
is
an
involuntary
termination.
and
that's
where
it
ends.
and
it
can
be
based
upon
a
loss
of
employment
through
a
firing
or
a
cancellation
of
a
contract.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
you
should
give
it,
your
honor,
a
lot
of
weight.
and
the
reason
you
should
is
because
in
1986,
the
withholding
and
the
fica
statutes
were
reenacted
in
full,
including
3402(o).
and
at
that
point
in
time,
there
was
a
revenue
ruling
in
place
that
said
that
all
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
not
wages
and
not
subject
to
fica.
and
under
the
legislative
reenactment,
congress
would
have
been
presumed
to
have
been
aware
of
that
revenue
ruling
that
was
in
place.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
but
what
the
important
aspect
is,
is
that
it's
not
remuneration
for
services.
in
the
coffy
case,
which
was
not
directly
dealing
with
whether
it
was
remuneration
or
not,
indicated
that
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
given
to
an
individual
because
of
the
loss
of
a
job.
and
as
i
indicated
in
the
--
even
the
government
has
indicated
that
some
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
are
not
wages
and
subject
to
fica.
where
we
differ
is,
is
that
we
say
all
of
them
are
not
wages
and
not
subject
to
fica.
what
the
government
says
is,
no,
we'll
issue
a
revenue
ruling
and
we
flip
flopped
our
position
several
times
on
the
different
revenue
rulings,
but
whatever
revenue
ruling
we
happen
to
issue
at
this
point
in
time
will
determine
whether
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
qualify
as
wages
for
fica
purposes
or
are
not
wages.
it's
our
position
that
the
statute
is
clear.
when
you
look
at
it,
especially
in
light
of
3402(o),
and
--
because
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
enactment
of
that
section
if
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
were
wages
already,
because
they
would
have
been
subject
to
fica.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
because
i
think
the
language
is
clear.
and
the
language
is
clear
because
it
says
--
in
the
title,
it
says
"other
than
wages".
if
any
of
them
were
wages,
they
wouldn't
have
used
the
word
"other
than
wages".
but
looking
at
the
statute
itself
and
using
the
traditional
tools
of
statutory
interpretation,
it
says
in
the
statute
that
they
are
to
be
treated
as
if
they
were
wages.
if
they
were
already
wages,
there'd
have
been
no
need
for
the
statute.
and
the
legislative
history
shows
us
what
congress
was
thinking
at
that
point
in
time,
because
it
says
in
three
different
places,
these
are
not
wages
and
also
it
indicates
it's
not
remuneration
for
services.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
yes,
in
1986.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s
hertzberg
thank
you.
