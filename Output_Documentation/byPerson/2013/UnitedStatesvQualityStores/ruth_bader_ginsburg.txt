justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
don't
we
have
a
decision
that
says
that
the
--
the
term
fica
purposes
and
income
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
a
question
about
the
effect
of
the
government's
position.
in
the
states,
if
these
--
if
we
say
these
benefits
qualify
as
wages
for
fica
purposes,
then
what
about
the
states
that
say
we
supply
unemployment
compensation
only
if
there
is
not
another
source
of
unemployment
compensation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
is
treated
for
income
tax
purposes
as
wages,
why
shouldn't
it
be
treated
for
fica
tax
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
your
are
saying
is
on
the
income
side
they
are
treated
as
wages;
on
the
fica
side
they're
not
treated
as
wages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
some
severance
payments
that
do
count
for
fica
purposes,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
review
again,
what
is
--
what
is
the
relevant
distinction
between
dismissal
payments
that
are
subject
to
fica
and
payments
that
are
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
to
be
involuntary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
sub
payments
are
all
voluntary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
--
well,
you
told
me
that
the
dismissal
payments
are
involuntary.
how
about
the
supplemental?
are
they
ever
and
always
voluntary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
that
we
should
just
ignore
their
revenue
rulings,
including
the
current
one,
and
just
deal
with
the
statute?
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
what
happens
to
the
state
compensation
schemes
which
the
revenue
rulings
seem
to
have
been
trying
to
accommodate?
