what
are
you
saying,

["]?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
hip.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
they
giving
them
the
money,
just
out
of
love?
i
mean,
they
don't
give
it
to
me
when
i
retire.
they
only
give
it
to
their
employees
when
they
retire.
what
--
what
are
they
paying
them
for?
aren't
they
paying
them
for
faithful
and
good
past
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
are
--
they
are
just
being
generous?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
they
do
that
for
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
earlier
statute
definition
of
wages
for
tax
purposes,
was
that
reenacted
at
the
same
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
really
have
--
you
call
into
play
the
principle
that
you
should
interpret
a
statute
to
make
sense
and
not
interpret
any
provision
to
be
superfluous,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
the
government's
interpretation
renders
it
superfluous.
justice
antonin
scalia
we'll
ask
him
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
acknowledge,
though,
that
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
the
two
sections
of
the
statute
together,
the
one
seems
to
be
unnecessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
"wages"
means
all
remuneration,
including
cash
value
of
all
remuneration,
including
benefits.
and
then
(o)
says
"extension
of
withholding
of
certain
payments
other
than
wages.
"
"for
purposes
of
this
chapter,
any
supplemental
and
unemployment
compensation
benefit
paid
to
an
individual
shall
be
treated
as
if
it
were
a
payment
of
wages.
"
suggesting
that
it
really
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
would
have
been
a
way
to
fix
the
revenue
rulings
without
doing
it
this
way.
couldn't
they
have
done
it
some
other
way
without
enacting
a
statute
that
contradicted
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
unless
it
was
in
a
section
that
said
how
to
treat
men
who
are
not
6
feet
tall.
the
title
of
this
section,
"extension
of
withholding
to
certain
payments
other
than
wages.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
--
it
clearly
suggests
that
these
are
not
wages.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
