justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
payments
were
not
keyed
to
the
length
of
service
and
to
salary?
it
was
just
a
flat
severance
payment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
the
coffy
case,
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
compensation
for
services
and
payments
that
are
contingent
on
the
employee's
being
thrown
out
of
work.
but
that
--
why
doesn't
that
apply
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
section
3402(o)
did
not
exist?
would
these
severance
payments
fall
within
fica's
definition
of
wages
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
why
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
government
explains
3402(o)
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
prior
admin
--
irs
administrative
decisions
exempting
certain
types
of
sub
payments
from
the
definition
of
wages.
and
that
--
that
can
explain
that
language.
the
language
that
they
are
--
that
sub
payments
are
to
be
treated
as
if
they
were
wages
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
all
of
those
sub
payments
are
not
wages.
it
does
necessarily
mean
that
at
least
some
of
them
--
or
suggests
at
least
some
of
them
are
not
wages.
so
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
explanation
of
the
language
along
those
lines?
