it
is,
but
it
--
really,
if
you
have
anything
--
the
definition
is
very
broad.
i
mean,
it
says
""wages"
means
all
remuneration
for
employment.
"
all
remuneration
--
wages
means
all
remuneration
for
employment
paid
basically
for
any
service
of
whatever
nature
performed
by
an
employee.
now,
i
agree
with
you
that
it's
the
same
definition
for
the
withholding.
but
congress,
it
passes
the
withholding
change
with
conflicting
interpretations.
so
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
congress
passed
a
statute
to
say:
we
don't
care
what
the
conflicting
interpretations
are;
ignoring
that,
you
are
going
to
withhold
this
money,
period.
and
it
said,
whether
it's
other
than
wages
or
not.
i
grant
you,
they
might
have
thought
they
had
to
pass
it,
but
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
could
also
look
at
it
as
they
didn't
have
to
pass
it.
it
was
subject
to
withholding
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no,
there
would
have
been
a
need,
if
different
people
think
different
things.
so
you
want
to
be
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
congress
does
that
quite
a
lot.
it
--
it
--
on
certain,
different
people
tell
them
different
things.
they
say,
we
don't
care;
do
it
anyway.
and
that's
what
this
statute
basically
says:
withhold
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
maybe
--
could
we
say
that?
could
we
say,
well,
in
our
opinion
you
are
right.
both
statutes
cover
supplemental
unemployment
benefits.
it's
never
come
up
in
the
other
context
since
this
because
congress
wanted
to
be
sure
it
was
withheld.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
take
it
that
you're
right,
that
congress
that
passed
the
withholding
statute
thought
it
fell
outside
of
the
definition
of
wages,
but
they
were
wrong.
now,
that
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
either.
so
--
but
congress
did
think
it.
so
what
weight
am
i
supposed
to
give
to
what
congress
thought
then
about
what
an
earlier
congress,
namely,
the
congress
that
passed
the
wage
definition
in
the
withholding
statute
thought?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes.
but
that
was
so
much
the
more
so,
you
see?
they
had
authority
saying
it
wasn't
wages.
that
doesn't
mean
that
authority
was
correct.
and
--
and
so
that's
why
they
passed
the
statute.
