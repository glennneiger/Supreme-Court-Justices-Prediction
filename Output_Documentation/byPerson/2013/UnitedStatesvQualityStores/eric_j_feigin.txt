mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
payments
in
this
case
fall
squarely
under
fica's
definition
of
wages,
which
includes
all
remuneration
for
employment.
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
fica
to
fund
the
social
security
and
medicare
programs,
this
court
has
construed
the
term
"employment"
broadly
to
encompass
the
entire
employer-employee
relationship.
the
payments
here,
which
were
paid
only
to
respondent's
employees
and
were
keyed
to
the
employees'
positions,
salary
levels,
and
length
of
service,
clearly
were
part
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
two
particular
features
of
the
statute,
i
think,
make
especially
clear
that
separation-related
payments
like
this
are
covered.
first,
the
basic
definition
of
wages,
both
historically
and
currently,
has
been
subject
to
specific
exclusions
for
certain
types
of
separation-related
pay
such
as
retirement
pay.
those
exclusions
would
be
unnecessary
if
the
basic
definition
of
wages
didn't
cover
separation-related
payments.
second,
one
of
the
historical
exclusions,
which
was
in
the
statute
from
1939
to
1950,
was
for
certain
types
of
dismissal
payments.
when
congress
eliminated
the
exception
for
certain
types
of
dismissal
payments
in
1950,
the
accompanying
house
report
made
clear
what
would
already
have
been
in
any
event
implicit
in
the
repeal
itself,
which
is
that
from
that
point
forward,
all
dismissal
payments,
which
were
--
congress
understood
in
the
house
report
to
include
any
payment
on
account
of
an
employee's
involuntary
separation,
would
be
considered
wages
under
fica.
respondent's
reliance
in
this
case
on
section
3402(o)
is
misplaced.
section
3402(o)
is
a
substantive
rule
of
income
tax
withholding,
but
is
expressly
limited
in
its
effect
to
chapter
24,
which
is
the
income
tax
withholding
chapter,
and
related
procedural
provisions.
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
definition
of
wages
for
purposes
of
fica.
in
any
event--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
two
points
about
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
nothing
in
this
court's
decision
in
rowan
suggests
that
this
court
or
any
court
needs
to
look
to
substantive
rules
of
income
tax
withholding
to
determine
the
basic
definition
of
wages
for
purposes
of
fica.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
preamble
to
section
3402(o)
that
congress
was
focused
on
chapter
24
and
was
trying
to
solve
a
specific
problem
within
chapter
24,
the
income
tax
withholding
chapter,
and
it
didn't
intend
to
send
essentially
shock
waves
through
the
internal
revenue
code
that
would
affect
the
definition
of
wages
in
other
chapters.
second,
respondent's
view,
i
think,
would
undercut
the
basic
principle
animating
rowan,
which
is
the
idea
that
the
definitions
of
wages
should
be
congruent
for
purposes
of
administrability.
respondent's
reading,
which
would
say
that
none
of
the
payments
specified
in
section
3402(o)(2)(a)
can
possibly
be
considered
wages
for
fica
purposes,
but
nevertheless
must
be
treated
as
wages
for
withholding
purposes,
would
require
employers
to
keep
separate
track
of
wages
for
the
two
different
purposes
and
report
them
separately
when
they
do
w-2
forms
for
the
employees
or
their
own
941
tax
returns.
now,
respondents
have
conceded
that
section
3402(o)
did
not
modify
the
preexisting
definition
of
fica
or
the
income
tax
withholding
chapter.
instead,
their
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
definition
of
fica,
even
before
section
3402(o)
was
enacted,
contained
a
hole
precisely
the
size
and
shape
of
the
definition
of
supplemental
unemployment
compensation
benefits
that
congress
later
codified
in
section
3402(o)(2)(a).
now,
they
haven't
pointed
to
a
single
statutory
provision,
regulation,
or
revenue
ruling
that
would
have
given
congress
that
view.
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
hole
existed
before
the
enactment
of
section
3402(o)
and
its
common
ground
that
it
doesn't
exist
after
section
3402(o).
it's
also
important
to
understand
why
congress
enacted
section
3402(o).
congress
enacted
section
3402(o)
in
response
to
a
suggestion
by
the
treasury
department
in
1969
that
there
was
a
problem
with
supplemental
unemployment
benefit
payments.
irs
itself
had
used
in
a
series
of
revenue
rulings
that
considered
certain
payments
by
employers
that
were
intended
to
supplement
state
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
and
the
irs
in
those
rulings
had
determined
that
those
benefits
were
not
wages.
now,
the
irs
in
1969
informed
congress
that
because
these
benefits
were
considered
non-wages,
it
was
creating
a
problem,
namely,
that
income
taxes
weren't
being
withheld
and
the
recipients
of
the
payments
were
receiving
large
income
tax
bills
at
the
end
of
the
year.
congress
enacted
section
3402(o)
to
address
that
specific
problem.
it
did
not
intend
to
modify
the
definition
of
wages.
it
--
nothing
in
the
section
3402(o)
can
be
taken
as
a
commentary
on
the
definition
of
wages
that
was
enacted--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--so
supplemental
unemployment
benefits,
as
defined
by
the
irs
in
its
revenue
rulings,
were
subject
neither
to
withholding
nor
to
taxation
under
fica.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
after
(o)
was
passed,
those
wages--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--they
still
were
not
subject
to
fica
tax.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
still
true
now
under
the
current
revenue
ruling,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
they
were
still
considered
to
be
income
under
the
revenue
rulings.
so
the
effect
of
that
was
that
they
were
receiving
pavements
during
the
year
that
were
considered
income
and
as
to
which
they
would
owe
income
tax,
but
the
income
tax
wasn't
being
regularly
withheld
as
--
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
on
wages,
and
therefore
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they'd
receive
a
large
income
tax
bill
for
those
payments.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
if
the
court
adopts
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
change
in
the
states
because
the
government's
position
is
the
status
quo.
now,
there
are
certain
states
that
do
look
to
the
federal
definition
of
"wages"
in
order
to
determine
whether
an
individual
qualifies
for
unemployment
benefits
under
state
law.
and
if
the
court
were
to
reach
some
other
conclusion
in
this
case
than
the
one
the
--
the
government
is
urging,
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be
some
effect
in
those
states
on
qualification
for
state
unemployment
benefits.
but
since
state
unemployment
benefit
qualification
is
largely
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
states
could
adjust
to
that
however
they
saw
fit.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
so
for
--
certain
employees
may
want
that
--
certain
payments
to
count
as
wages
because
the
definition
of
fica
purposes
is
identical
to
the
definition
of
"wages"
under
the
social
security
act.
and
under
the
social
security
act,
the
accrual
of
benefits
is
based
on
--
on
wages.
so
some
employees
may
want
to
have
earned
more
wages.
however,
in
this
case,
they're
not
making
that
argument.
they're
simply
arguing
that
they
shouldn't
have
to
pay
taxes
on
these
payments
which
were
made,
again,
only
to
employees,
were
keyed
to
the
employees'
positions,
salaries
and
length
of
service
and
clearly
meet
fica's
definition
of
"wages".
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--we
still
think
that
would
meet
the
basic
definition
of
fica,
your
honor,
and
would
still
count
as
wages
and
be
taxable
under
fica.
i
think
this
case
is
even
easier
than
that
because
the
payments
were
clearly
keyed
to
critical
aspects
of
the
employment
relationship.
indeed,
in
the
case
of
the
post-petition
payments,
the
payments
were
expressly
conditioned
on
the
employee's
willingness
to
remain
performing
services
for
respondents
during
the
pendency
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
so
coffy
was
addressing
not
fica,
but
a
statute
that
dealt
with
veterans'
rights
returning
to
work
after
a
period
of
military
service.
as
construed
by
this
court,
that
statute
drew
a
distinction
between
a
reward
for
length
of
service,
to
which
the
returning
veteran
was
entitled,
and
short-term
compensation
for
services
rendered
to
which
the
returning
benefit
--
returning
veteran
--
excuse
me
--
was
not
entitled.
now,
that
distinction
doesn't
exist
under
fica.
even
if
a
particular
payment
is
considered
a
reward
for
length
of
service,
as
this
court
held
that
the
payments
in
coffy
were,
it
would
still
be
remuneration
for
services
under
fica's
definition
of
wages.
for
example,
if
you
were
to
give
an
employee
an
award
after
20
years
of
service,
that
would
clearly
be
a
reward
for
length
of
service
and
would
qualify
as
such
under
coffy,
but
would
not
be
remuneration
for
employment.
now,
the
specific
question
you
asked,
justice
alito,
about
the
difference
between
payments
that
are
part
of
the
continuing
employment
and
payments
that
occur
at
the
end
of
the
employment
relationship,
is
also
not
a
distinction
that
fica
draws.
as
i
said
earlier,
there
are
a
number
of
historical
and
current
exclusions
for
certain
types
of
payments
that
are
triggered
by
the
end
of
the
employment
relationship.
for
example,
from
1954
to
1983
the
statute
expressly
excluded
retirement
pay.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
basic
definition
of
fica
that
would
include
retirement
pay
but
exclude
severance
payments.
and
again,
i
think
it's
very
pertinent
here,
and
probably
the
best
piece
of
evidence
we
have
in
this
case
about
congressional
intent,
that
congress
from
1939
to
1950
excluded
from
the
basic
definition
of
fica
certain
types
of
dismissal
payments,
by
which
it
meant
payments
on
account
of
involuntary
separation;
and
then
it
eliminated
that
exclusion
in
1950,
making
clear
both
as
a
statutory
matter
and
it's
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
such
payments,
that
is
payments
on
account
of
involuntary
separation,
would
from
that
point
forward
be
covered
as
wages
under
fica.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
time.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
first
want
to
address
justice
sotomayor's
question.
justice
sotomayor,
if
you
believe
that
the
revenue
rulings
that
the
irs
has
issued
are
irrational
or
invalid,
the
only
colorable
reason
for
believing
that
is
because
the
payments
that
those
revenue
rulings
classify
as
non-wages
are
clearly
wages
under
fica's
basic
definition.
and
if
you
believe
the
revenue
rulings
are
invalid
for
that
reason,
then
that
is
all
the
more
reason
to
rule
for
the
government
here,
because
respondent's
position
would
create
an
even
bigger
hole
in
the
statute
that
would
classify
even
more
payments
as
non-wages
and
is
even
less
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
so,
your
honor,
we
acknowledge
that
the
revenue
rulings
are
not
consistent
with
the
statutory
text
of
fica.
the
revenue
rulings
accept
certain
payments
from
classification
as
wages
that
the
plain
text
of
fica
unambiguously
classify
as
wages.
the
revenue
rulings
are
a
continuation
of
a
practice
that
began
in
the
1950s
and
'60s,
which
was
a
somewhat
more
freewheeling
time
in
the
history
of
statutory
interpretation.
and
to
the
extent
the
irs
would
defend
these
in
a
case
in
which
they're
challenged
in
court,
it
would
not
be
because
they're
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
statute,
but
simply
because
congress
has
taken
the
revenue
rulings
as
a
given
and
passed
statutes
that
effectively
assumed
that
the
revenue
rulings
are
being
effective,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
a
couple
points
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
first,
just
to
pick
up
on
the
textual
point--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
just
to
pick
up
on
the
textual
point
that
justice
alito,
i
think,
was
adverting
to
earlier.
saying
that
particular
types
of
payments
shall
be
treated
as
if
they
were
wages
made
during
a
payroll
period
doesn't
mean
that
it's
categorically
impossible
for
such
payments
to
have
qualified
as
wages
to
begin
with.
as
judge
bryson
pointed
out
in
the
--
his
opinion
to
the
federal
circuit
in
the
csx
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
if
you
were
to
say
to
treat
all
men
as
if
they
were
6
feet
tall,
that
wouldn't
mean
that
no
man
could
possibly
be
6
feet
tall.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
it
says--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
it
says,
"certain
payments
other
than
wages".
second,
i
would
point
you
to
the
part
where
it
says,
"treated
as
wages
for
a
payroll
period.
"
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
and
that
actually
has
some
significance
in
that
it
allows
the
employer
to
treat
these
as
wages
paid
during
the
employer's
normal
payroll
period,
so
the
withholding
can
be
performed
in
the
same
way
that
the
employee
would
have
withheld
for
normal
payroll
period
payment
and
avoids
the
need
to
apply
the
rules
that
would
govern
in
circumstances
where
payments
are
made
outside
of
a
payroll
period.
and
these
are
payments
that
could
well
have
been
made
outside
a
normal
payroll
period,
but
this
directs
that
they
be
treated
as
payments
within
a
payroll
period.
i
would
again
point
the
court
back
to
the
historical
reason
why
3402(o)
exists.
it
was
enacted,
as
i
discussed
earlier,
following
a
suggestion
by
the
treasury
department
that
there
was
a
particular
problem
with
withholding
that
needed
to
be
solved.
now,
justice
scalia,
i
suppose
congress
might
have
solved
that
problem
in
different
ways,
but
i
think
what
congress
did
here
is
it
simply
tried
to
solve
the
problem
once
and
for
all.
it
just
declared
that
these
payments
should
be
treated
as
if
they
were
wages
so
that
withholding
would
occur,
thereby
solving
the
problem
that
the
irs
identified.
and
it
enacted
a
definition
of
supplemental
unemployment
compensation
benefits
that
everyone
agrees
is
broader
than
the
set
of
payments
that
the
revenue
rulings
up
to
that
point
had
accepted.
and
there
are
a
couple
of
very
good
reasons
congress
would
have
done
it
that
way.
one
is
that,
because
of
the
irs's
case-specific
approach
to
each
of
its
revenue
rulings,
it
would
have
been
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
for
congress
to
craft
statutory
language
that
precisely
captured
the
contours
of
the
payments
that
the
irs
either
was
treating
or
might
later
treat
as
non-wages.
second,
again,
the
supplemental
unemployment
benefit
plans
that
are
evolved
in
the
1950s
continued
to
evolve
and
take
different
forms.
and
i
think
the
irs
just
wanted
to
hedge
against
the
possibility
--
excuse
me.
congress
wanted
to
hedge
against
the
possibility
that
the
irs
might
later
decide
that
a
plan
structured
slightly
differently
from
any
plan
that
it
had
considered
before
should
also
be
considered
nonwages.
and
there
was
absolutely
no
downside
to
congress
writing
the
definition
in
3402(o)(ii)(a)
more
broadly
than
the
irs
rulings
had
thus
far
had
an
opportunity
to
construe.
that's
because,
again
as
the
federal
circuit
pointed
out,
there
is
no
practical
harm
done
if
you
treat
--
if
you
are
instructed
to
treat
a
particular
payment
as
wages
and
that
payment
already
is
wages.
now,
your
honor,
to
your
point
about
surplusage,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
the
canon
against
surplusage
would
help
you
construe
fica
here
because
i
think
fica
is
unambiguous.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
way
to
read
the
definition,
3402(o)(2)(a).
in
any
event,
the
only
way
this
would
be
superfluous
is
if
some
court
were
to
hold,
on
an
issue
that
is
not
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case,
that
the
irs
has
absolutely
no
administrative
authority
to
craft
administrative
exceptions
to
the
definition
of
wages
for
policy
reasons,
as
it
did
in
the
revenue
rulings
that
underlie
the
enactment
of
section
3402(o)
here.
if
a
court
were
to
reach
that
conclusion,
then
section
3402(o)
might
not
have
any
operative
effect.
but
congress
in
1969
clearly
could
not
have
believed
that
the
revenue
rulings
were
ineffective
or
it
never
would
have
enacted
section
3402(o)
in
the
first
place.
there's
no
other
reason
congress
could
have
thought
that
certain
types
of
supplemental
unemployment
benefits
were
excepted
from
the
definition
of
"wages".
my
friend
on
the
other
side
mentioned
these
1968
regulations.
those
regulations
only
applied
to
payments
from
trusts.
they
didn't
apply
to
payments,
like
the
payments
at
issue
in
this
case,
that
come
directly
from
the
employer.
those
regulations
did
not
purport
to
construe
the
definition
of
fica
or
the
income
tax
withholding
statutes.
and
in
fact,
since
1957
there
has
been
an
income
tax
withholding
regulation
that
specifically
says
that
any
payment
on
account
of
an
employee's
involuntary
separation
does
constitute
wages
for
withholding
purposes.
and
congress
was
presumably
aware
of
that
regulation.
and
again,
i
would
just
like
to
address
one
final
point.
i
think
opposing
counsel's
argument
about
this
1986
reenactment
doesn't
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
i
think
the
argument
is
that
when
congress
reenacted
the
statute
in
1986
it
was
somehow
adopting
the
then-current
interpretation
of
the
irs
in
a
1977
revenue
ruling.
i
don't
think
that
the
enactment
of
section
3402(o)
originally
in
1969
can
be
taken
to
have
left
the
irs
with
sufficient
flexibility
to
change
its
practices
during
the
1970s,
but
that
the
reenactment
of
that
very
same
language
in
1986
would
be
taken
to
freeze
for
all
time
and
--
the
current
irs
practices
and
foreclose
the
irs
from
ever
modifying
those
practices
in
the
future.
finally,
respondents
point
to
the
legislative
history
of
3402(o),
which
does
contain
some
statements
that
supplemental
unemployment
compensation
benefits
aren't
wages.
i
think
some
of
the
reason
for
that
legislative
history
is
confusion
about
the
nomenclature.
there
were
irs
used.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
must
have
been
looking
at
the
irs
revenue
rulings,
again
because
there
is
simply
nothing
else
that
could
have
possibly
given
the
irs
the
impression
that
any
of
these
types
of
payments
weren't
wages
to
begin
with.
and
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
court
not
just
look
at
the
legislative
history
piecemeal,
but
look
at
the
entire
historical
backdrop
if
it
decides
to
get
into
any
of
that
at
all.
but
we
think
this
case
is
very
easily
resolved
on
the
plain
text
of
fica,
which
clearly
includes
these
payments.
we
don't
even
think
there
is
a
need
to
look
at
section
3402(o),
which
is
limited
in
effect
to
the
income
tax
withholding
provisions
and
was
enacted
to
solve
a
specific
income
tax
withholding-related
problem
and
not
to
affect
fica's
basic
definition
of
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
the
revenue
rulings
aren't
directly
at
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
all
the
revenue
rulings
do
is
specify
that
certain
payments
--
not
the
type
of
payments
that
are
issued
in
this
case
--
are
not
wages.
and
nobody
contends
that
the
revenue
rulings
have
any
effect
or
any
special
bearing
on
this
case,
because
this
is
a
case
about
payments
that
both
the
irs
in
its
revenue
rulings
and
congress
under
the
plain
text
of
fica
would
classify
as
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
two
points
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
again,
these
exceptions
first
came
into
existence
in
the
1950s
and
1960s,
and
i
quite
candidly
don't
think
the
irs
was
as
careful
about
fidelity
to
text
as
a
modern
legal
observer
would
be.
second,
if
this
court
were
to
believe
that,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
irs's
revenue
rulings
are
indirectly
at
issue
in
this
case
for
the
reasons
i
said
to
justice
ginsburg,
if
this
court
believes
that
it
cannot
rule
for
the
government
in
this
case
on
the
statutory
question
without
concluding
that
the
revenue
rulings
are
invalid,
we
still
think
the
court
should
rule
for
the
government
on
the
statutory
question.
we
think
the
statutory
text
is
clear,
and
that
is
the
irs's
position
notwithstanding
the
revenue
rulings.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
so
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
government
is
correct
on
a
--
as
a
statutory
matter,
but
we're
to
make
clear
that
revenue
--
the
current
revenue
ruling,
revenue
ruling
90-72
was
invalid,
that
might
have
some
effect
on
individuals'
eligibility
for
unemployment
benefits
under
state
law
in
those
states
that
incorporate
the
federal
definition
of
wages
as
part
of
the
calculation
for
eligibility
for
state
unemployment
benefits.
if
that
creates
any
bad
results,
states
will
be
able
to
fix
them,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
should
preclude
this
court
from
holding
what
the
plain
text
of
fica
i
think
in
this
case
requires.
thank
you.
