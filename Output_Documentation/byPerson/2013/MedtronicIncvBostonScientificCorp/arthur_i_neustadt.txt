mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
circuit
got
it
right
in
this
case.
the
federal
circuit
took
the
well-settled
law
on
burden
of
proof
and
it
applied
it
to
two
stipulated
facts
and
reached
a
conclusion
that
it
had
to
reach.
it
was
controlled
by
it.
the
two
stipulated
facts
were:
number
one,
when
mirowski's
counsel,
me,
wrote
letters
to
medtronic,
that
was
not
a
notice
of
infringement.
there
could
be
no
infringement
in
this
case.
infringement
is
defined
as
"using
a
patented
invention
without
authority.
"
medtronic
had
authority.
it
was
licensed.
the
second
stipulated
fact
--
and
this
is
at
page
51
of
the
joint
appendix
--
is
that
medtronic
is
a
licensee.
it
cannot
be
an
infringer.
so
everything
that
you
say
about
infringement
involves
a
completely
different
situation.
there
was
no
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof.
the
well-settled
law
that
i
referred
to
is
the
normal
default
rule.
the
normal
default
rule
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
fundamental
tenets
of
our
jurisprudence.
it
says
that
if
a
party
files
a
complaint
and
seeks
relief,
it
has
the
responsibility
to
prove
that
it
is
entitled
to
that
relief.
and
the
normal
default
rule
has
the
word
‵‵
default
′′
in
there
because
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
doesn't
decide
the
burden
of
proof.
and
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
statute
does
not
decide
the
burden
of
proof.
so--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--i'll
tell
you
what's
different
here.
the
difference
is
that
there
is
no
infringement.
medtronic
is
a
licensee.
as
a
result,
there
can
be
no
coercive
counterclaim.
as
the
chief
justice
noted,
they're
paying
royalties.
there
is
no
infringement.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
pardon
me?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
a
permissive
counterclaim
by
definition
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
that
is
involved.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
no,
they
cannot
because
medtronic
is
a
licensee.
they
cannot
be
an
infringer.
and
the
difference--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--pardon
me?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
no.
i'm
sorry,
i
interrupted
you.
go
ahead.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
okay.
that's
not
what
happened
in
medimmune.
first,
if
you
change
--
if
you
change
the
facts
and
medtronic
starts
infringing
because
it
stops
paying
royalties,
of
course
you
get
different
results.
here's
what
happened
in
medimmune
in
our
situation--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--medtronic
is
holding
the
money.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
we
do
not
have
access
to
the
money
that
they're
holding,
correct.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
there
can't
be--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--because
we
agreed
to
that
in
the
agreement.
that's
part
of
our
agreement.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
but
we
don't
--
we
agreed
to
not
receiving
the
money.
everyone
is
operating
in
accordance
with
the
license.
we
can't
say,
you're
withholding
money
and
not
paying
it
to
us.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
pardon
me?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
i'm
sorry?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
oh,
we
are
bound
by
the
agreement
that--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--no,
they're
not
infringing.
it's
claim
coverage.
medtronic
cannot
infringe
because
they're
a
licensee.
the
dispute
is
over
claim
coverage.
it's
not
infringement.
that's
why
we
cannot
have
a
counterclaim
for
infringement.
justice
scalia's
question,
the
big
difference
is
that
we
cannot
counterclaim
for
infringement.
under
the
normal
default
rule
where
the
party
seeking
relief
has
the
burden
of
proof,
you
have
to
look
at
the
case,
and
you
have
to
ask
yourself--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--well,
they
just--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--yes,
i
believe
you
are.
what
medtronic
wants
in
this
license
is
they
want
an
insurance
policy
for
their
future
products.
the
problem
is
that
they
could
--
if
they
don't
have
a
license,
they
can
get
enjoined.
so
they
build
this
insurance
policy
so
that
they're
protected,
and
then
they
even
have
a
provision
whereby
they
can
go
and
file
a
dj
action.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
there
are
two
types
of
dj
actions
in
this
circumstance.
one
is
where
the
accused
infringer
says:
i
am
not
infringing
and
i
want
a
dj
to
that
effect.
in
that
response,
where
you
are
talking
about
infringement
and
not
claim
coverage,
the
patentee
has
to
counterclaim.
it's
compulsory.
the
patentee
then
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
case
because
he
has
claimed
infringement.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
because
under
the
normal
default
rule,
if
only
one
party
is
seeking
relief,
that
party
has
the
burden
of
proof.
you
get
into
a
more
complicated
situation--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--the
--
if
you
take
the
normal
default
rule
as
set
forth
in
schaffer,
which
is
the
case
we
cite,
and
it's
this
court's
precedent
involving
an
individual
education
program.
and
this
court
specifically
states
if
the
parents
bring
the
suit,
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
because
they're
seeking
relief.
and
if
the
school
district
brings
a
suit,
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
because
they're
the
ones
who
are
seeking
relief.
wherever
you
have
a
case
where
only
one
party
is
seeking
relief,
the
normal
default
rule
is
applicable
and
the
party
that
seeks
relief
has
to
prove
it.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
it
wasn't,
but
that
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
there's
no
exception
for
declaratory
judgment
cases
in
the
normal
default
rule.
it's
based--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
claim
coverage.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
correct.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yes.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
normal
default
rule
is
a
fundamental
tenet,
that
you
can't
go
into
court
and
say
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
defendant
to
disprove
the
allegations
of
my
complaint.
in
cases
where
you
have
the
counterclaim,
of
course
the
patentee
is
going
to
have
the
burden
of
proof.
in
cases
where
there
can
be
no
counterclaim,
you
have
only
one
party
seeking
relief
and
that
party
has
the
burden
of
proof.
and
it
follows
from
the
normal
default
rule,
which
is
the
rule
of
the
court
--
rule
of
this
court.
it's
the
established
rule
of
the
land.
it's
a
fundamental
tenet
that
a
party
cannot
come
into
court--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--right.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
no,
you're
not
going
to
have
to
litigate
the
whole
thing.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
i
agree.
but
you're
not
going
to
have
to
relitigate
the
whole
thing.
this
issue
is
going
to
be
decided
on
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
we
don't
have
the
burden.
they
have
the
burden
on
that.
once
that's
decided--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--oh,
of
course.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
of
course.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yeah.
that's
all
true,
and
i'm
not
arguing
with
it.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
no.
first
of
all--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--okay.
i
will
give
you
two
answers.
the
first
answer
is
you
are
never
going
to
get
this
situation
because
the
last
thing
in
the
world
medtronic
wants
to
do
is
give
up
its
license.
so
it's
not
going
to
--
it's
not
going
to
stop
paying
royalties.
the
second
thing
is--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--okay.
now,
to
follow
your
--
to
follow
--
to
follow
your
hypothetical,
the
court
who,
say,
tries
the
issue
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there's
claim
coverage,
and
let's
just
say
we
prevail
on
that.
when
there's
a
subsequent
infringement
action,
you're
correct,
we
cannot
say
that
they're
estopped
by
res
judicata
or
issue
preclusion.
but
we
can
say,
your
honor,
you've
seen
this
entire
case.
now,
where
it
was
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
before,
it's
now
preponderance
of
the
evidence
on
the
other
side.
it
may
be
the
difference
between
49.9
and
50.5.
and
we're
going
to
bring
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--and
i've
got
one
further
answer
to
that.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
and
that
is,
there
is
no
exception
to
--
to
100
percent
lack
of
finality
with
respect
to
the
normal
default
rule.
the
normal
default
rule
is
more
important
than
saying
that
if
there
is
a
little
bit
of
chance
of
a
lack
of
finality,
we're
going
to
throw
out
the
entire
normal
default
rule
in
--
in
favor
of
this
rule
and
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
party
who
is
not
even
seeking
any
relief.
and
there
was
no
shifting
in
this
case.
shifting
involves
starting
with
a
position,
shifting
to
another
position.
as
soon
as
they
filed
the
suit
and
you're
the
only
party
seeking
relief,
they
would
have
the
burden
of
proof.
now,
if
they
are
infringing,
we
can
counterclaim.
then
we're
going
to
have
the
burden
of
proof
because
that's
an
issue
where
you
have
two
parties
seeking
relief
and
that's
a
little
more
complicated.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
we're
not
seeking
it
in
the
suit.
the
way
the
agreement
was
between
the
parties
was
if
medtronic
disagrees
with
our
assessment,
then
they
can
go
ahead
and
file
a
dj
action
and
if
they
can
prevail
in
that
dj
action,
they
won't
have
to
pay.
we
seek
nothing
in
the
suit.
we
have
no
counterclaim.
we're
asking
for
nothing.
as
to
justice
kennedy's
question
before,
as
notice
of
infringement,
there
was
no
notice
of
infringement.
what
we
told
them
was
there
was
claim
coverage.
and
there's
a
big
difference
between
claim
coverage
and
infringement.
if
we
tell
them
that
we're
asserting
infringement,
we're
going
to
have
the
burden
of
proof.
we
can't
assert
infringement
because
they're
the
licensee.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
but
then
you're
changing
all
the
facts
around.
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
and
in
medimmune--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--no.
that
is
--
permit
me
to
disagree
with
you.
medimmune
was
not
involved
with
that.
here
was
the
problem
in
medimmune.
the
medimmune
did
not
want
to
continue
to
pay
the
royalties,
but
it
needed
the
license.
80
percent
of
its
product
line
was
dependent
upon
that
license.
so
as
a
matter
of
sheer
rigidity,
they
could
not
not
pay
the
royalty.
they
will
lose
their
whole
business.
they
wanted
to
get
into
federal
court.
at
that
time,
the
federal
circuit
had
a
gen-probe
ruling
which
says
everyone's
paying
royalties,
there's
no
dispute.
in
medimmune,
this
court
reversed.
you
said
there's
enough
of
a
controversy
for
medimmune
to
have
this
--
to
--
to
go
in
with
a
dj
action.
in
that
suit,
it'd
be
exactly
like
this
suit.
the
patentee
could
not
counterclaim
because
there
is
no
infringement.
medimmune
is
still
paying
its
royalties.
so
in
the
medimmune
case
--
but
they
never
got
to
it
because
--
because
that
medimmune
case
was
settled
--
you
have
the
exact
same
situation
we
have
here,
which
is
that
there
is
no
counterclaim,
and
therefore,
medimmune,
who
is
seeking
relief,
has
the
burden
to
show
it's
entitled
to
relief.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
i
think
it's
pretty
close.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
it's
absolutely
not
true.
first
of
all
--
well,
the
first
answer
--
and
i'll
get
to
the
second
answer
--
is
if
you
have
that
and
say,
well,
it's
more
convenient
for
us
to
do
it,
you're
creating
a
patent
law
exception
to
the
normal
default.
and
that's
something
you
keep
telling
the
federal
circuit
not
to
do.
like
in
ebay,
don't
create
a
separate
patent
rule
for
injunctions.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
but
you
only
have
that
substantive
rule
where
the
patentee
counterclaims.
when
the
patentee
counterclaims,
you
have
two
parties
seeking
relief;
naturally,
the
patentee
has
the
burden
of
proof.
if
there
is
no
counterclaim,
there
can
be
no
infringement.
you're
just
talking
about
claim
coverage.
but
it's
the
second
part
of
your
question,
justice
breyer,
what
happens
is
the
patentee,
when
they
give
notice
of
claim
coverage,
they
can
tell
them.
there's
no
mysteries--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--well,
they
always
do.
there's
no
mystery.
if--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--well,
sure.
i
mean,
if
you
go
into
the
suit,
the
first
question
is
interrogatory,
why
do
you
think
this
--
why
do
you
think
this
is
covered?
so
there's
no
mystery
as
to
that.
and
it's
much
easier
to
prove
non-infringement
than
to
prove
infringement,
because
these
are
guided
by
the
all
elements
rule.
the
all
elements
rule
means
that
if
the
patentee
wants
to
prove
infringement
of
a
claim
that
has
ten
elements,
he's
got
to
prove
ten
elements
or
in
--
or
in
your
example,
many
more.
for
the
person
who
is
--
is
the
licensee,
you
want
to
prove
non-infringement,
he
has
to
only
pick
one
of
those
elements
and
say
i
don't
cover.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yeah.
and
that
argument
wasn't
even
presented
to
the
federal
circuit
before
its
decision.
and
the
federal
circuit
would
have
openly
rejected
it
and
say
you've
got
to
be
kidding
me.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yes.
the
analysis
that
the
federal
circuit
did
is
they've
got
a
burden
of
proof
issue.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
let
me
find
the
controlling
law.
the
controlling
law
is
the
normal
default
rule.
i've
got
only
one
party
here
seeking
relief,
and
that's
the
--
the
licensee,
so
why
shouldn't
he
prove
this?
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
yeah.
and
then
you've
got
--
and
then
you--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--oh,
sure.
hundreds
of
claims,
that's
ridiculous.
you
know,
the
courts
say,
hey,
you
know,
i
have
other
cases
on
my
docket,
get
down
to
five
claims.
anticipate
any
argument?
the
person
suing,
the
dj
licensee,
doesn't
have
to
anticipate
any
argument.
he
said,
you
told
me
it
was
these
claims.
and
we
even
had
an
agreement
with
him
we
couldn't
go
over
30.
and
all
i
got
to
do
is,
in
claim
1,
we
don't
have
element
number
6.
in
claim
2,
we
don't
have
element
number
4.
it's
a
very
simple
manner.
there
is
no
problem
whatsoever
there.
so
what
the
federal
circuit
did
is:
i've
got
a
burden
of
proof
issue.
let
me
find
the
controlling
law.
look
at
the
supreme
court.
the
supreme
court
says
there
is
a
normal
default
rule,
and
it's
the
party
seeking
relief.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
we
can
never
seek
it
because
they
are
not
infringing.
and
we
do
not
have
to
file
a
counterclaim
for
claim
coverage,
because
there
is
no
requirement
that
we
do
so.
there
is
no
coercive
complaint.
if
they
are
suing
--
if
there
was
a
non-infringement
situation,
we'd
would
have
to
file
the
coercive
complaint.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
it
doesn't
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
the
--
in
answer
to
your
hypothetical,
i
agree
with
you
on
all
of
that.
but
as
in
the
medimmune
case,
medimmune
ends
up
with
the
burden
of
proof.
medimmune
says:
i've
got
to
get
a
resolution
to
this
question.
i
want
you
to
overrule
gen
pro,
i
want
to
show
why
my
product
is
not
covered.
well,
all
of
that's
fine,
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
that,
there
is
no
coercion.
it's
just
that
when
medimmune
does
this
it's
going
to
have
the
burden
to
show
it.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
of
course.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
the
way
it
is,
if
you
have
one
party
seeking
relief,
the
licensee--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--the
licensee's
got
he
burden.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
no,
i'm
afraid
not.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
so
really
what
the
federal
circuit
did
said
there
was
no
shifting
here.
first
you
got
to
look
to
who's
got
the
burden
of
proof.
you
get
that
from
schaffer,
the
normal
default
rule:
only
one
party
seeking
relief.
and
then
they
said,
and
besides,
the
patentee
could
not
have
brought
suit
because
he
couldn't
have
brought
infringement.
so
you
have
a
simple
case
of
only
one
party
seeking
relief;
that
party
has
the
burden.
and
you
would
have
that
anyway
even
without
this
agreement,
because
only
one
party
can
bring
suit.
it's
just
like
in
schaffer.
this
party
brings
suit,
they
have
the
burden.
other
party
brings
suit,
they
have
the
burden.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
it
can't
be
a
patent
action
because
the
whole
purpose
of
the
license
is
not
to
have
an
infringer.
and
it
is
a
contract
action
and
that
gets
into
the
jurisdictional
question.
to
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question,
yes,
there
isn't
the
usual
jurisdiction
that
you
would
have
in
a
patent
infringement
action.
and
this
comes
from
the
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
earlier
this
year
in
gunn
vs.
minton,
in
which
i
think
your
honor,
your
honor
was
the
author,
which
says
that
that's
just
a
contract
action.
just
having
a
patent
question
doesn't
get
you
into
federal
court.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract,
because
then
they've
breached
the
contract.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
it's
not
in
accordance
with
the
agreement.
we
can't
bring
an
infringement
suit.
they
are
not
infringing.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
oh,
sure.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
well,
of
course.
but
that's
not
the
situation
we
face
here.
that's
always
been
true.
i
mean,
if
they
want
to,
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
so
burdensome
to
them,
just
go
ahead
and
breach.
and
then
we
will
sue
them
and
we
will
have
burden
of
proof.
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
you
cannot
say--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--but
how
can
i
sue
later
if
you're
continuing
to
pay
royalties?
that
was
the
medimmune
situation.
medimmune
said,
i've
got
to
pay
you
royalties--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--well,
that's
absolutely
right.
but
in
that
case
--
and
the
court
didn't
rule
upon
it
because
it
got
remanded
--
they
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
because
they
are
the
only
party
seeking
relief.
you
can't
say--
mr.
arthur
i.
neustadt
--oh,
that's
correct.
that's
the
normal
default
rule.
and
there
should
be
no
exception
to
that.
i
see
my
light
is
red.
