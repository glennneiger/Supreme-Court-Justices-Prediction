chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
case
12-1128,
medtronic
v.
boston
scientific
corporation.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
we
could
--
all
that
may
be
true,
but
we
need
to
cut
down
to
the
basic
issue,
which
is
medimmune
changes
all
that.
the
idea
is
you're
moving
along
with
the
license,
everybody's
happy.
all
of
a
sudden
you
jump
into
court.
why
shouldn't
you
have
the
burden
as
the
party
who
seeks
to
disturb
the
status
quo?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
but
i
guess
the
argument
is
that
it's
the
mirror
image
of
an
action
that
could
not
have
been
brought
because
medtronic
is
paying
royalties.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
neustadt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
you
are
overlooking
the
elephant
in
the
room,
which
is
the
relief
they
are
seeking
is
protection
against
the
relief
that
you
would
be
seeking
but
for
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
really
looking
at
it,
though,
from
the
view
of
a
contract
action
rather
than
a
patent
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
thank
you
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
