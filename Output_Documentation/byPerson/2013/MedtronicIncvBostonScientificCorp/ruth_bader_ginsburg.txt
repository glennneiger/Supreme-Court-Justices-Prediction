mr.
waxman,
what
do
you
make
of
the
patent
listing
non-infringement
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
an
infringement
suit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you
--
what
you
just
responded,
that
would
go
as
well
for
an
alleged
infringer
who
is
not
a
licensee,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
here
--
this
case
is
about
the
difference
between
the
licensee
and
the
non-licensee.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
the
--
we
have
one
friend
of
the
court
brief
that
says
this
is
not
a
case
arising
under
the
patent
law,
it
arises
under
contract
law.
it's
a
contract
case
with
a
patent
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
a
permissive
counterclaim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
a
permissive
counterclaim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
could
--
could
the
patentholder
bring
in
the
declaratory
action
a
counterclaim
for
infringement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
not
--
weast
was
not
--
was
not
a
patent
infringement
case.
it
wasn't
a
declaratory
--
it
wasn't
a
declaratory
judgment,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
isn't
that
true
here?
because
you
are
seeking
release
of
the
escrowed
funds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
cite
--
you
cite
the
default
rule
and
you
rely
on
that
totally.
but
there
are
other
rules
on
burden
of
proof,
for
example,
the
party
who
has
better
access
to
the
information.
so
it's
not
as
though
there
is
this
firm
rule
with
no
exceptions.
i
take
it
from
your
answers
to
justice
scalia
that
you
are
saying
in
every
declaratory
judgment
action
where
only
one
party
is
seeking
relief,
that
party
has
the
burden
of
proof.
so
you're
not
limiting
this
to
patent
cases;
is
that
right?
