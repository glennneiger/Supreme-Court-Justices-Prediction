justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
you
could
say
that
about
any
declaratory
judgment
action.
you
can
say
the
person
bringing
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
seeking
the
relief.
and
if
--
if
we
follow
what
you
said,
that
then
the
burden
shifts
in
every
declaratory
judgment
action.
and
it
clearly
doesn't.
i
mean,
we
--
we've
said
time
and
again
that
the
burden
of
proof
normally
does
not
shift.
what's
different
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it
is
often
the
case
in
declaratory
judgment
actions
that
the
defendant
in
the
action
cannot
counterclaim.
i
mean,
it
typically
occurs
when
somebody
doesn't
want
to
be
in
breach
of
contract
and
--
and
brings
a
suit
to
see,
you
know,
claiming
if
i
do
this
i
won't
be
in
breach.
the
other
side
can't
counterclaim
because
the
person
hasn't
been
in
breach.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
is
to
enable
you
to
sue
before
the
other
side
has
a
cause
of
action
against
you.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
so
--
so
why
should
the
fact
that
the
other
side
doesn't
have
a
counterclaim
change
anything?
that's
usually
the
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
normal
default
rule.
we
are
dealing
with
a
declaratory
judgment
statute,
and
we've
said
time
and
time
again
that
it
doesn't
alter
the
burden
of
proof.
and
your
response
is:
well,
it
does
when
the
other
side
can't
counterclaim.
and
my
response
to
that
is:
usually
the
other
side
can't
counterclaim.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
declaratory
judgment
act
doesn't
change
it;
that's
your
position?
what
do
you
do
about
the
res
judicata
problem?
let's
assume
that
we
put
the
burden
of
proof
where
you
want
it.
okay?
so
this
declaratory
judgment
action
is
defeated.
all
right?
nonetheless,
they
say:
still
and
all,
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
and
not
pay
any
royalties.
and
then
you
bring
--
you
bring
an
infringement
action,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is
the
prior
decision
res
judicata
or
are
you
going
to
have
to
relitigate
the
whole
thing,
but
this
time
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
you
never
--
you
never
established
that
you're
entitled
to
any
--
any
infringement
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
--
you
would
normally
have
the
burden
as
--
as
the
person
claiming
infringement.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
so
you'll
have
to
relitigate
the
whole
thing
because
you
--
you
never
established
that
there
was
infringement.
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
all
you've
established
is
that
they
didn't
prove
non-infringement.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
to
relitigate
the
whole
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
alternative?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
my
hypothetical,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is,
justice
scalia,
you're
right,
but
it
doesn't
matter
very
much.
that's
your
answer,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
addressed
to
potential
coercion,
not
actual
coercion.
that's
the
whole
point.
you
should
be
able
to
bring
the
suit
before
coercion
is
applied.
now,
it
is
true
that
you're
not
applying
coercion
right
now,
but
what
they're
worried
about
is
if
they
stop
paying
the
royalties,
you
will
apply
coercion
and
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
a
way
of
getting
this
on
the
table
before
a
court
without
their
having
to
go
into
default
and
incurring
all
the
penalties,
but
it
is
not
intended
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
shift
the
burden
of
proof
because
if
what
they
are
worried
about
is
your
claiming
infringement
and
exacting
a
penalty
from
them
for
their
not
paying
the
royalties
that
the
agreement
provides,
okay?
that's
what
they
are
worried
about.
the
declaratory
judgment
act
enables
them
to
sue
beforehand,
before
they
incur
liability.
that's
its
whole
purpose,
and
its
purpose
is
not
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
always
say
that
in
declaratory
judgment
actions:
that
is
not
the
situation
we
face.
the
declaratory
judgment
act
posits
a
hypothetical
situation.
it
always
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
worried
that
you
are
going
to
sue
me
later.
you
are
not
suing
me
now.
that's
not
the
situation
i
face.
but
i
worry
that
you
will
sue
me
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
want
to
--
they
don't
want
to
continue
to
pay
royalties.
that's
the
point.
that's
why
they
bring
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
so
that
the
court
can
tell
them:
you
don't
have
to
pay
royalties
because
this
stuff
is
not
covered.
