now,
this
concerns
just
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion.
it
doesn't
concern
the
burden
of
production;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel

alito,
jr.
well,
if
that's
all
that's
involved,
then
the
case
doesn't
seem
to
amount
to
quite
as
much
as
one
might
have
thought
otherwise,
does
it?
if
--
suppose
the
--
the
patentee
has
the
burden
of
production
so
they
would
have
to
explain
why
there
was
infringement;
they
would
have
to
introduce
proof
of
infringement.
and
the
only
difference
is
who
wins
when
the
--
the
factfinder
thinks
that
it
was
exactly
in
equipoise.
