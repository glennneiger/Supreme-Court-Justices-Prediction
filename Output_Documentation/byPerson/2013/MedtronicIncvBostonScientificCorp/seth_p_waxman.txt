mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
patent
law
places
the
burden
of
proving
infringement
on
the
patentee.
and
until
this
case,
it
was
settled
that
the
burden
does
not
shift
if
the
issue
arises
in
a
declaratory
action
seeking
a
judgment
of
non-infringement.
the
federal
circuit
imposed
a
different
rule
in
suits
brought
under
medimmune
where
the
party
seeking
a
declaration
of
non-infringement
is
a
licensee.
that
was
error.
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
inheres
in
the
governing
substantive
law
while
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
procedural
only
and
does
not
change
substantive
rights.
the
burden
of
proof
in
medimmune
actions,
like
all
other
declaratory
actions,
remains
where
it
would
have
rested
in
the
equivalent
coercive
suit
brought
by
that
patentee.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
that's
--
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
although
as
we
point
out,
that
the
word
‵‵
burden
of
proof
′′
--
i
think
the
word
‵‵
burden
of
proof
′′
used
in
the
opinion
below
could
be
thought
to
be
addressed
to
both
points,
but
the
parties
agree
that
the
relevant
consideration
here
is
the
burden
of
proof,
and
that
trial
judges
do
retain
discretion
to
make
rules
about
ordering
--
the
ordering
of
proof
in
patent
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
well,
that,
of
course,
was
not
what
happened
in
--
not
what
the
respondent
maintained
should
happen
in
this
case.
but
taking
your
question
as
it
is,
this
court
has
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
the
burden
of
--
where
the
burden
of
persuasion
rests
is
very
often
outcome
--
outcome
determinative.
and
that
is
certainly
true
in
patent
cases.
what
the
jury
is
told
about
who
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
surpassingly
important
in
many
cases,
including
many
patent
cases.
and
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
mean,
the
substantive
--
the
--
the
reason
why
the
federal
circuit
erred
is
clearly
doctrinal,
which
is
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
burdens
of
proof,
like
standards
of
proof,
are
substantive.
they
inhere
in
the
substantive
right,
and
the
court
has
also
said
repeatedly
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
procedural
only
and
doesn't
change
substantive
rights.
but
i
think
if
you
go
to
a
--
to
the
policy
question,
justice
alito,
reversing
the
burden
in
a
declaratory
action
would
impair
the
purpose
and
utility
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
which
was
enacted
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
determining
how
the
equivalent
coercive
action
would
be
resolved
without
the
--
without
requiring
the
declaratory
judgment
plaintiff
to
subject
itself
to
retrospective
liability.
and,
indeed,
shifting
the
burden
would
threaten
the
issue
preclusive
effect
of
the
declaratory
judgment,
frustrated--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
--
the
reason,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
reason
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
substantive,
and
a
declaratory
judgment
action
under
the
act
is
not
--
is
aimed
not
to
change
any
substantive
rights.
and
that's
why
all
of
the
decided
cases
in
this
area,
except
for
the
one
below,
left
the
burden
exactly
where
substantive
patent
law
left
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you're
right
about
that,
and
that
would
be
true,
justice
kennedy,
on
all
medimmune
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
formality
of
a
notice.
i
mean,
the
issue
that
this
court
addressed
in
medimmune
--
the
question
that
you're
raising,
i
think,
is
one
that
goes
to
article
iii
jurisdiction.
you
can't
use
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
to
get
the
court
to
answer
a
hypothetical
question.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
the
notice
is
the
--
well,
it's
essential
to
the
article
iii
medimmune
question
whether
or
not
there
actually
is
a
case
or
controversy.
so,
in
this
case,
it's
perfectly
obvious
because
the
cont
--
the
license
requires
medtronic
to
affirmatively
go
to
mirowski
within
30
days
of
introducing
any
product
and
not
only
tell
--
providing
notice
of
the
product,
but
providing
the
manual,
the
diagrams
and
the
manuals
that
are
given
to
physicians
so
that
mirowski
can
determine
within
60
days
whether
or
not
to
assert
infringement.
in
medimmune,
you
didn't
have
that
procedure,
but
the
court
still
held
in
the
context
of
that
case
that
because
genentech
had
made
clear
that
it
thought
that
the
cabilly
patent
covered
the
accused
devices,
there
was
sufficient
--
sufficiently
concrete
controversy
that
medimmune
did
not
have
to
stop
paying
royalties
and
breach
the
license.
and
--
and
so,
therefore
--
i
think
i
may
be
talking
around
your
question,
but
i
am
trying
to
get
to
the
point
that
the
--
the
requirement
of
some
notice,
the
--
the
patentee
--
there's
no
declaratory
judgment
jurisdiction
if
the
patentee
doesn't
know
about
the
product,
has
--
has
never
done
anything
to
suggest
that
the
product
--
that
his
or
her
patent
reads
on
the
product.
but
that
is
an
article
iii
question
that
would
be
--
you
wouldn't
get
to
the
burden
of
proof
if
you
couldn't
satisfy
medimmune.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
agree
with
the
articulation
of
the
point
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
united
states
brief,
which
is
that
the
cases
have
recognized
that
non-infringement
can
either
be
a
general
defense
--
that
is,
when
--
when
non-infringement
is
simply
a
general
denial
of
a
cause
of
--
of
a
claim
of
infringement,
it
is
not
an
affirmative
defense.
but
there
are
particular
types
of
non-infringement
claims.
and
the
ones
that
i'm
familiar
with
are
prosecution
history
estoppel
and
the
experimental
use
exception
that
are
affirmative
defenses.
in
other
words,
those
are
situations
in
which
the
alleged
infringer
says:
hey,
i'm
not
saying
that
your
patent
doesn't
read,
all
the
claims
of
your
patent
don't
read
on
my
invention;
i'm
claiming
non-infringement
because
i
was
making
experimental
use
and
that
has
affirmatively
been
determined
by
congress
not
to
infringe.
or,
yes,
your
--
the
elements
of
your
claim
read
upon
my
invention,
but
during
the
prosecution
of
the
patent
in
the
patent
office,
you
disclaimed
some
claim
scope,
and
under
prosecution
history
estoppel,
this
court
elucidated
in
festow
there
is
no
infringement.
this
is
a
case
involving
a
general
denial
of
infringement
and
therefore
it
is
not
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i
mean
--
absolutely.
i
mean,
the
point
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
so
a
defense
of
non-infringement,
a
general
defense
of
non-infringement,
is
not
an
affirmative
defense.
and
in
the
--
the
potential
or
correlative,
coercive
action
which
would
have
been
a
suit
for
patent
infringement
by
mirowski
had
we
ceased
making
the
royalty
payments,
they
would
have
borne
the
burden
of
proving
infringement
unless
we
raised
an
affirmative
defense
like
prosecution
history
estoppel
or
experimental
use,
in
which
case
we
would
have
the
burden.
the
point
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
that
the
burden
is
left
exactly
where
it
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
--
had
the
identical
issue
arisen
in
the
absence
of
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure.
and
in
this
respect,
it
is
identical
to
the
jury
trial
right,
which
this
court
held
in
beacon
theatres
v.
westover
is
also
an
element
of
the
substantive
claim
and
also
cannot
be
deprived
by
the
peculiarity
of
a
declaratory
judgment
being
a
claim
for
an
equitable
remedy.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mm-hmm.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
so
if
i
understand
your
question,
first
to
--
to
go
to
the
license
in
this
case.
this
case
not
only
involves
products
that
didn't
--
that
aren't
specifically
articulated
in
a
license
agreement;
neither
the
patents
nor
the
products
at
issue
in
this
case
had
even
been
conceived,
much
less
in
existence,
at
the
time
the
license
agreement
was
in
effect.
but
in
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
in
a
situation
in
which
i
make
widget
a
and
you
claim
that
you
have
the
patent
that
reads
on
that
widget,
and
i
--
you
agree
to
license
me
to
do
it,
if
the
license
--
if
payment
of
the
license
depends
upon
a
determination
that
it
otherwise
would
be
infringing,
i
can
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
seek
a
declaration
that
it's
not
infringing.
that
is,
if
the
cover
--
if
the
license
covers
only
products
that
otherwise
would
infringe,
i
can
bring
a
dec
action
claiming
non-infringement
and
you
would
bear
the
burden,
assuming
that
you
had
threatened
in
some
way
to
enforce
your
patent
against
me.
in
--
in
the
--
the
situation
that
--
sort
of
bogeyman
situation
that
mirowski
and
the
i
--
intellectual
property
owner's
brief
articulate,
which
--
imagine,
which
is
you
license
--
i
have
a
--
i
have
a
product,
you
have
a
patent,
you
license
it
to
me,
and
i
turn
around
the
next
day
and
sue
for
non
--
a
declaration
of
non-infringement,
there
are
any
number
of
ways
that
you,
as
the
patentee,
could
protect
yourself
from
that
extraordinary
eventuality.
you
could
provide,
for
example,
that
--
i
--
you
would
require
me
to
issue
a
--
you
know,
to
--
to
--
to
pay
a
paid-up
royalty
for
all
use.
or
you
could
simply
say:
we
don't
care
whether
the
patent
infringes
or
not;
you
agree
to
pay
me
three
dollars
per
unit
sold.
or
you
could
put
a
provision
in
that
would
say:
if
you
sue
for
patent
infringement,
the
royalty
rate
goes
to
3x.
or
for
that
matter,
if
you
sue,
that
will
--
that
can
--
i
can
deem
that
a
breach
of
the
license
agreement
and
recover
the
remedies
that
patent
law
allows,
an
injunction
and
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees
in
the
context
of
a
--
a
willful
action.
i
want
to
underscore,
although
the
federal
circuit
made
a
broad
rule,
exactly
what
we
have
here.
in
this
case,
mirowski
--
this
license
is
from
1991.
mirowski
--
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
there's
no
dispute
that
mirowski
has
received
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
of
royalties
from
medtronic
for
its
patents.
it
gets,
as
a
benefit
of
this
license,
notice,
as
i
said,
within
30
days
of
every
new
product
and
the
manual,
and
it
can
require
medtronic
to
start
accruing
royalties
and
an
interest
rate
of
2
--
of
2
points
over
prime
as
soon
as
it
sends
us
a
notice.
and
moreover,
in
the
--
in
the
litigation
tolling
agreement,
we
agree
that,
even
though
we
are
not
a
party
in
the
reference
st.
jude
action,
we
would
be
bound
by
any
determination
in
that
adjudication
whereas
otherwise
we
wouldn't.
so
this
license
agreement
was
enormously
beneficial
and
couldn't
be
farther
from
the
scenario
of
i
have
a
widget,
i
agree
to
license
it,
and
the
next
day
i
turn
around
and
sue
you.
but
in
that
event,
there
would
be
lots
and
lots
of
remedies.
i
do
want
to
underscore
one
other
thing,
that
the
federal
circuit
said
that
it
was
applying
this
special
rule
only
in
medimmune-type
cases.
but
the
rationale
of
the
court
is
that
what
causes
the
burden
to
shift
is
the
absence
of
a
counterclaim
for
infringement.
that
would
have,
for
example,
caused
the
burden
to
shift
in
the
myriad
case
that
this
court
decided
last
term,
where
there
was
one
researcher
at
nyu
who
had
standing
to
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
there
was
no
basis
for
myriad
to
claim
infringement
because
he
had
made
clear
that
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
engage
in
the
research
and
clinical
work
that
he
was
going
to
so
long
as
he
was
in
risk
of
patent
infringement
remedies.
and
that
--
the
source
of
the
rule,
the
source
of
the
law
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies,
is
in
substantive
patent
law.
and
this
court
has
said
for
125
years
that
it
rests
with
the
infringer.
what
neither
the
federal
circuit
nor
my
friend
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
has
ever
identified
is
what
is
the
source
of
the
rule
that
shifts
the
burden
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
can't
be
the
declaratory
judgment
act
because
that
act
is
procedural
only.
if
i
can
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'd
be
happy
to
respond
to
any
questions
that
the
court
has.
otherwise,
i
would
submit
on
the
briefs.
