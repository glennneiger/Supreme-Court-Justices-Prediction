justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
as
i
understand
it
the
agreement
in
this
case
identified
certain
patents
and
contemplated
that
there
would
be
disputes
about
whether
particular
products
of
medtronic
violated
or
infringed
or
practiced,
whatever,
those
patents.
but
there
might
be
some
other
kinds
of
agreements
which
instead
identify
certain
products--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
essentially
treat
those
as
infringing
products
in
the
absence
of
a
license.
in
that
sort
of
agreement,
would
you
make
the
same
kind
of
claim,
that
if
medtronic
had
that
agreement
that
identified
certain
products,
but
medtronic
woke
up
one
day
and
said,
you
know
what,
we
don't
think
that
those
products
infringe,
we
essentially
want
to
relitigate
our
agreement,
can
medtronic
come
to
court
and
do
that
via
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
and
if
so
who
would
bear
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
they
can
be
an
infringer,
mr.
neustadt,
if--
justice
elena
kagan
--they
can
be
an
infringer
if
they
say
we're
ignoring
our
agreement;
we're
not
paying
royalties,
but
we're
going
to
go
on
and
continue
making
the
product.
then
mvf
would
say
they
would
be
infringing.
and
that's
the
world
that
medimmune
imagines
is
happening.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i'm
finished.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
neustadt,
i
think
i
just
disagree
with
that.
you
keep
on
saying
it's
a
question
of
claim
coverage,
but
the
question
of
claim
coverage,
all
that
is,
is
part
of
an
infringement
analysis.
and
that's
the
analysis,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
that's
the
analysis
that
would
have
been
appropriate
if
medtronic
had
stopped
paying
royalties
and
mvf
had
sued
medtronic
as
a
result
for
patent
infringement.
and
that's
the
world
that
we're
supposed
to
imagine
after
medimmune,
is
if,
contra
the
--
the
actual
agreement,
the
licensee
stopped
paying
royalties
and
we
think
about
an
infringement
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
--
it's
not
a
patent
law
exception.
it's
the
recognition
that
a
procedural
device
that
simply
changes
the
nominal
status
of
the
parties
doesn't
change
the
substantive
rules,
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
counts
as
a
substantive
issue.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
neustadt,
i
was
under
the
impression
that,
according
to
this
contract,
if
medtronics
stops
paying
royalties
you
can
bring
not
only
a
contract
suit,
but
in
fact
a
patent
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
an
infringement
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
can
bring
an
infringement
suit
according
to
the
very
agreement
that
you
signed.
justice
elena
kagan
they
are
infringing
if
they
break
the
contract
and
they
stop
paying
royalties.
justice
elena
kagan
and
then
you
can
bring
an
infringement
suit.
