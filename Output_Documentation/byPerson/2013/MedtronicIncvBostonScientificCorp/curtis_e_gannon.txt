mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
agrees
that
using
the
same
burden
of
proof
that
would
apply
in
the
hypothetical
coercive
action
that
underlies
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
the
best
thing
to
do
in
this
mirror
image
declaratory
judgment
action.
that
best
serves
the
purposes
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
allows
for
final
resolution
of
the
types
of
controversies
that
this
court
contemplated
in
medimmune.
if
i
could
turn
to
justice
kagan's
point
about
an
incident
in
which
the
parties
had
actually
agreed
to
whether
certain
products
were
covered
by
a
particular
license.
that
would
be
different
from
the
situation
we
have
here,
because
the
products
in
question
here
weren't
actually
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
underlying
license
agreement.
the
whole
point
of
that
aspect
of
the
license
agreement
was
to,
as
you
said,
channel
future
disputes
into
this
particular
dispute
resolution
mechanism.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
was
not
about
to
suggest
that,
justice
sotomayor.
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
think
that's
the
--
that
--
that
that
would
probably
be
the
least
logical
way
to
deal
with
the
quandary
that
might
arise
from
thinking
that
somebody
is
then
trying
to
breach
the
license.
and
we
don't
think
there's
any
license
breach
here
because
there
wasn't
any
prior
agreement
on
the
fact
that
these
future
products
were
going
to
be
covered
by
the
--
by
these
patents
or
they'd
be
practicing
these
patents.
but
even
if
there
were
some
concern
about
the
licensee
turning
around
and
challenging
the
agreement
that
it
had
previously
made,
it
seems
like
the
problem
there
is
either
that
they
should
be
estopped
by
what
they
already
said
in
the
agreement
or
lear
needs
to
be
extended
to
keep
them
from
being
estopped
in
that
way.
but
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
seems
like
an
odd
way
to
get
at
solving
whatever
the
quandary
there
might
be.
and
i
think
that
at
some
point,
this
--
this
also
interweaves
with
a
point
that
the
chief
justice
made
about
whether
medtronic
here
is
seeking
to
change
the
status
quo.
and
we
don't
think
that
medtronic
is
seeking
to
change
the
status
quo
here,
for
a
couple
different
reasons.
one
of
them
is,
as
i
was
just
saying,
that
the
agreement
here
didn't
actually
reach
--
the
license
agreement
here
didn't
--
it
didn't
include
a
meeting
of
the
minds
about
whether
these
particular
future
products
would
be
covered
by
these
patents,
including
one
of
the
patents
was
reissued
after
the
time
of
the
license.
and
also,
this
license
agreement
expressly
preserved
the
parties'
ability,
including
medtronic's
ability,
to
challenge
both
the
validity
and
the
enforceability
of
the
patent.
that's
at
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
so
there's
no
way
in
which
i
think
it
can
be
legitimately
said
that
medtronic
is
trying
to
either
get
out
of
its
contractual
obligations
or
to
change
the
status
quo.
the
status
quo
right
now
is
that
the
royalties
are
collecting
in
a
certified
account,
and
so,
in
a
sense,
both
parties
are
trying
to
change
the
status
quo
in
trying
to
get
the
stream
of
royalties
that
either
is
applicable
to
these
products
or
isn't
on
the
basis
of
the
resolution
of
a
question
that
the
parties
had
not
decided,
but
said
would
be
decided
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
like
this.
and
we
think
that
the
best
way
to
think
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
like
this
is
that
it
is
the
mirror
image
of
the
underlying
coercive
hypothetical
action
that
could
have
been
brought
against
medtronic.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
the
same
thing
is
true
in
medimmune,
and
i
think
that
the
court
noted
that
the
--
in
medimmune
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
was
intended
to
help
get
the
party
out
of
the
dilemma
it
would
be
in,
in
deciding
whether
it
should
continue
to
be
effectively
coerced
into
paying
royalties
that
it
thinks
it
doesn't
need
to
pay
or
exposing
itself
to
the
risks
associated
with
--
with
breaching
the
license
and
--
and
being
subject
to
treble
damages,
attorneys'
fees
and
the
other
remedies
that
would
be
available
under
the
patent
act.
and
yet,
even
though
there
had
been
no
infringement
in
that
case
and
no
breach
of
the
contract
in
that
case,
which
is
also
true
here,
because
so
far,
everybody
has
been
behaving
the
way
the
license
expected
them
to
behave,
the
court
recognized
that
the
parties
had
a
concrete
dispute
about
the
applicability
of
the
patents
to
those
particular
products,
that
the
scope
of
the
contract
was
not
going
to
require
payment
of
royalties
where
the
patent
did
not
apply,
and
said
that
the
--
the
issues
that
were
going
to
be
resolved
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
there
were
going
to
involve
questions
of
patent
validity,
patent
enforceability,
and
scope
of
coverage,
patent
infringement,
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
medtronic
has
raised
in
their
complaint
--
the
well-pleaded
complaint
that
you
would
look
to
here
is
one
that
arises
under
the
patent
act
and
includes
claims
involving
all
three
of
those
issues,
just
as
was
the
case
in
medimmune.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
we
do
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
this
case
involves
a
claim
that
arises
under
the
patent
laws,
for
the
reasons
that
i
was
just
saying.
i
think
that
the
way
to
--
the
way
to
conceptualize
this
is
to
look
to
what
the
well-pleaded
complaint
would
be
in
the
hypothetical
coercive
action
that
would
be
being
brought
against
medtronic
if
we
didn't
have
the
problem
presented
by
the
fact
that
they
haven't
actually
breached
the
contract
or
infringed
at
this
point.
and
we
have
every
reason
to
think
that
that
hypothetical
coercive
action
is
one
that
arises
under
the
patent
laws
because
it's
one
involving
infringement.
that's
the
dispute
that
the
parties
acknowledge
that
they
have.
in
the
litigation
tolling
agreement
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
talks
about
the
fact
that
the
parties
have
a
dispute
under
section
271
of
the
patent
act.
in
the
red
brief
here,
mirowski
has
--
has
told
us
on
page
48
that
if
medtronic
were
to
cease
paying
royalties,
that
the
recourse
would
be
that
they
would
bring
an
infringement
suit.
and
the
complaint
here
in
paragraph
5
alleges
that
the
claim
here
arises
under
the
patent
act.
and
because
it
does
arise
under
the
patent
act
and
because
it's
clear
here
that
all
of
the
defensive
issues
would
also
be
federal,
as
i
mentioned
before,
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
this
--
this
would
arise
under
the
patent
laws,
which
would
provide
for
district
court
jurisdiction
under
section
1338
and
exclusive
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
circuit
under
section
1295(a)
even
before
the
amendments
in
the
america
invents
act
in
2011.
i
think
that
there
is
one
other
point
that
would
be
worth
making
in
response
to
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
about
the
--
the
potential
problems
here
associated
with
whether
the
parties
have
an
incentive
to
enter
into
these
type
of
licensing
arrangements.
as
mr.
waxman
already
explained,
the
patentholder
here
got
lots
of
benefits
out
of
--
out
of
entering
into
an
agreement
like
this,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
would
leave
themselves
open
to
precisely
the
suits
that
the
agreement
contemplated,
which
was
a
suit
involving
both
infringement
and
validity
questions;
and
that
under
the
circumstances,
there's
--
they
had
plenty
of
incentive
to
enter
into
a
license
agreement,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
would
continue
to
bear
the
same
burden
of
proof
that
they
would
bear
in
every
other
procedural
context
in
which
patent
infringement
claims
have
arisen
up
until
now.
and
so
i
think
that
in
that
sense,
that's
--
that's
not
a
sea
change
from
their
perspective.
and
--
and
yet,
even
if
they
were
to
think
it
so,
as
mr.
waxman
explained,
a
licensor
in
that
context
would
have
several
mechanisms
that
they
could
use
in
order
to
rejigger
the
balance
between
the
parties
if
they
wanted
to,
and
--
and
i
think
that
we
agree
with
--
with
everything
on
the
list
that
mr.
waxman
mentioned,
including
having
fully
paid-up
licenses
or
allowing
a
suit
for
infringement
or
invalidity
to
constitute
a
termination
of
the
license
that
would
allow
the
patentholder
to
bring
an
infringement
action.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse.
