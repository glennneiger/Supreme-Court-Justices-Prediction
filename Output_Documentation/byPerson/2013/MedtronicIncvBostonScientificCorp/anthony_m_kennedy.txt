anthony

does
it
help
your
answer
or
--
or
does
it
limit
the
theory
of
your
case
too
much
to
say
that
in
this
case,
there
is
a
controversy
satisfying
the
declaratory
judgment
rules
because
the
patentholder
gave
notice
of
potential
--
or
of
infringement?
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
could
we
--
or
should
we
make
the
case
turn
on
that
or
can
we
say,
with
declaratory
judgment,
there
has
to
be
a
dispute,
we
--
we
know
that
a
dispute
is
likely,
a
controversy,
so
the
formality
of
a
notice
is
not
important.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
goes
to
me
to
--
a
basic
question
of
fairness.
when
i
picked
up
this
case,
i
thought,
how
is
the
patentholder
supposed
to
know
what
all
these
new
inventions
are?
what
does
it
know
about
it?
but
then
i
answered
my
own
question
by
saying,
well,
it
gave
notice
of
infringement.
but
--
that's
why
i've
asked
if
the
notice
is
essential
to
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand.
suppose
the
licensee
says:
this
isn't
covered
by
the
agreement
at
all;
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
anything.
and
it
starts
to
manufacture
its
products.
that's
--
that's
the
whole
point.
it's
outside
the
agreement;
they
are
not
going
to
pay
you
anything.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
missing
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
would
have
been
infringement
if
you
had
refused
to
pay
the
royalty,
and
--
and
if
they
had
refused
to
pay
the
royalty
and
you
were
covered,
then
--
then
there
would
have
been
infringement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
i
understand.
