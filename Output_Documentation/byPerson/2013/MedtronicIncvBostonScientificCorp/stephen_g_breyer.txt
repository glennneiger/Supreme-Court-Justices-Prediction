justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
shouldn't
there
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
there
be?
i
take
what
you're
saying
is
that
their
claim
is,
look
--
you
called
it
claim
scope
or
something.
what
did
you
call
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
claim
coverage.
they
say:
we
have
a
product
and
it
doesn't
violate
the
patent
for
the
reason
that
the
claims
in
the
patent
don't
cover
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
want
to
call
that
a
claim
coverage.
i
would
call
it
no
infringement.
call
it
what
you
wish.
but
the
fact
is
there
are
--
and
moreover,
you
couldn't
bring
a
counterclaim
because
he's
already
agreed
that
if
he
loses
his
suit,
he'll
pay
you
the
money.
so
there's
nothing
to
claim
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
know.
now,
all
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
nonetheless
the
fact
is
in
many
claims
--
in
many
instances,
though
perhaps
not
yours,
this
kind
of
claim,
i.e.
that
person's
patent
does
not
cover
my
product--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
actually
a
way
of
saying
whether
your
product
infringes
the
patent,
one
way
of
saying
that.
so
their
point
is,
call
it
what
you
wish,
but
where
you
have
a
claim
which
amounts
to
a
claim
that
my
product
does
not
infringe
his
patent,
the
rule
that
should
apply
is
the
person
who
owns
the
patent
should
have
to
prove
that
the
claims
do
cover
the
product.
and
there
are
a
lot
of
good
reasons,
et
cetera,
that
they
put
in
their
brief
why
that
should
be
so.
it's
easiest
for
the
patentee
to
know
in
what
respect
it
violates
the
claim.
normally,
a
patent,
being
a
monopoly,
should
not
have
too
many
advantages
beyond
the
scope
of
the
monopoly.
and
we
don't
like
false
patents
because
that
--
you'd
have
different
results
in
the
same
kind
of
patent
with
different
people
depending
upon
whether
in
some
other
instance
your
client
brought
a
suit
or
whether
this
was
--
i
mean,
you've
read
the
arguments.
so
looking
at
those
functional
arguments,
is
there
any
answer
that
you
have
to
their
point
other
than
cases
in
different
subject
matters
where
burdens
of
proof
did
shift?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
--
what
do
you
do
with
the
government's
argument
here,
which
i
take
it
as
being
on
page
17,
they
make
an
argument
which,
as
i
understood
it
--
which
is
a
big
qualification
--
the
--
the
--
some
of
these
things
are
awfully
complicated.
you
might
have
a
--
a
claim
or
really,
it's
a
set
of
claims
that
cover
48
pages
with
all
kinds
of
symbols
in
--
in
42
different
sort
of
division
possibilities.
and
then
the
--
the
so-called
infringer
or
the
person
who
falls
outside
the
coverage
is
looking
at
his
product,
and
it's
one
of
the
most
complex
things
you've
ever
seen.
and
he
has
to
think
to
himself,
well,
how
--
how
am
i
supposed
--
how
does
the
claim
cover
this?
and
--
and
it's
--
there
are
many,
many,
many
possibilities.
i
take
it
that's
what
they
mean
when
they
say
it
makes
sense
to
put
the
burden
of
demonstrating
how
the
claim
limitations
map
onto
the
accused
product,
because
infringement
may
be
found
only
when
the
product
falls
within
the
scope
--
scope
of
the
asserted
claim
or
claims
in
every
respect.
your
client,
who's
the
patentee,
knows
that;
otherwise,
he
wouldn't
be
bringing
this
infringing
suit
or
the
inside-the-coverage
suit,
or
responding
to
someone
who
says
it's
outside
the
coverage.
but
--
but
the
person
who
is
the
alleged
infringer
might
not
know
it,
and
therefore,
it
makes
sense
to
put
everything
in
the
same
place;
notice
of
infringement,
burden
of
production,
burden
of
proof.
and
that
way,
it
will
be
easier
to
focus
on
what's
at
stake.
that's
what
i
take
it
their
argument
is.
if
i've
not
got
it
right,
you're
certainly--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
they
have
to
tell
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
always
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
a
good
point.
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
page
19
or
whatever
i
quoted
is
a
made-up
thing
which
doesn't
ever
never
really
exist
in
your
experience.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
the
first
question
would
be,
well,
you
tell
me
how
--
how
this
infringes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
i
don't
really
care
about
what
is
an
action
where
there
is
an
infringement
action
or
there
even
could
be
one
in
the
circumstances
before
us,
that's
not
my
case
because
they're
going
to
pay
me
forever
if
they
lose
this
declaratory
judgment,
so
there's
no
shift.
and
where
there's
no
shift,
you
ought
to
follow
the
rules
for
where
there's
no
shift,
which
is
that
the
burden
lies
on
the
person
bringing
the
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
argument
is
that
the
horribles
don't
exist
because
the
one
on
page
19
never
has
come
up,
and
as
far
as
the
no
--
no
res
judicata,
i
don't
care
because
i'll
come
to
the
same
result
with
a
different
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
any
other
--
is
there
any
other
--
is
there
any
other
practical
point
that
they
brought
up
that
you
want
respond
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
would
agree
with
this.
you
would
agree
that
if
that
agreement
of
yours
read
a
little
differently,
medimmune
--
if
they
had
said,
we
are
not
going
to
pay
royalties
until
your
client
brings
an
infringement
suit,
which
you
intend
to
do,
at
that
point,
if
you'd
made
that
promise,
you
would
have
the
burden
of
proof,
because
you'd
bring
an
infringement
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
said
either
an
infringement
suit
or
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
then
again
you
would
have
the
burden
of
proof,
even
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
because
then
they
would
be
totally
parallel.
i
mean,
then
you'd
have,
if
you
brought
the
infringement
suit,
it's
yours.
and
then
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
it
could
be
true
too,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
answer
is
yes
or
no.
the
answer
is
yes
or
no.
that
is,
am
i
right
in
understanding
your
argument
that
if
that
agreement
had
said
you
can
bring
either
kind
of
suit,
either
we,
yes,
we
the
patentee,
will
bring
a
suit,
in
which
case
you
will
defend
it;
or
if
you
bring
it
first,
you
can
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
okay?
for
the
same
thing.
if
it
had
said
that
and
the
agreement
had
held
up
the
royalties
until
one
or
the
other
was
decided,
then
your
client
the
patentee
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
either
because
it's
exactly
the
same
thing.
you
could
have
brought
--
are
you
following
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
skip
it.
[laughter]
