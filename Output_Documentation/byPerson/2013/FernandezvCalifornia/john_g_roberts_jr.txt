roberts,

we'll
hear
argument
next
today
in
case
12-7822,
fernandez
v.
california.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
randolph,
i
forget
exactly
how
many
times,
but
repeatedly
said
it
was
discussing
a
case
involving
the
physical
presence.
and
it
had
to
do
that
because
it
was
drawing
a
very
formalistic
line.
if
the
other
person
had
been
in
the
back
room
instead
of
at
the
door
or
if
the
other
person
had
been
away
for
a
minute,
randolph
by
its
terms
would
not
apply,
because
it
said
physical
presence.
so
it's
not
even
extending
randolph
to
its
logical
conclusions.
it
specifically
said,
we
are
not
reaching
anything
beyond
physical
presence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
what
we
said
in
king
just
last
year
or
the
year
before
--
it's
a
quote:
"there
are
many
entirely
proper
reasons
why
police
may
not
want
to
seek
a
search
warrant
as
soon
as
the
bare
minimum
of
evidence
needed
to
establish
probable
cause
is
acquired.
"
"the
police
may
want
to
ask
an
occupant
of
the
premises
for
consent
to
search
because
doing
so
is
simpler,
faster,
and
less
burdensome
than
applying
for
a
warrant.
"
that
seems
to
me
to
entirely
refute
the
idea
that
oh,
well,
what
they
should
do
is
get
a
warrant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what's
the
conversation
between
the
husband
and
the
battered
wife,
bleeding,
holding
the
four-year-old
baby
going
to
look
like?
presumably,
it
has
to
take
place
away
from
the
police
because
it's
--
you
know,
it's
a
private
conversation.
so
the
spouse
abuser
says
to
the
police
just
give
me
a
few
minutes.
let
me
talk
to
my
wife.
and
that
conversation
is
going
to
lead
to
some
accommodation
that
you'd
be
prepared
to
honor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
quoted
you
the
lang
--
i
quoted
you
the
language
from
king
from
last
year
where
we
said
that's
not
an
adequate
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
purely
an
--
there's
--
the
language
i
quoted
said
any
number
of
reasons.
one
reason
may
be
if
the
police
leave
and
the
woman
is
there
--
we're
dealing
with
gang
violence
--
that
other
members
of
the
gang
may
come
and
say,
you
know,
retrieve
the
contraband
in
the
house.
going
to
get
a
warrant
is
not
a
sufficient
answer
in
--
in
every
case.
there
are
--
there's
a
reason
that
the
law
has
recognized
the
efficacy
of
consent
in
allowing
the
police
to
enter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
don't
think
there
would
be
exigent
circumstances
in
the
case
of
--
this
case,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
fisher.
mr.
karlin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
palmore?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
six
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
it
would
render
randolph
a
dead
letter.
the
--
randolph
was
expressly
limited
to
physical
presence.
it
expressly
acknowledged
that
it
was
formalistic,
and
even
the
concurring
opinion
said,
quote,
"the
court's
opinion
does
not
apply
where
the
objector
is
not
present
and
objecting.
"
so
what
you're
really
arguing
for
is
an
extension
of
randolph,
not
an
undermining
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
