justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
fisher,
i
wasn't
here
for
randolph.
i
have
trouble
getting
my
mind
around
this
entire
problem.
i
would
never
think
of
telling
my
co-tenant
that
she
could
not
invite
her
friends
or
other
people
into
the
house.
and
so
i
don't
understand
why
the
fact
that
one
is
a
joint
tenant
is
not
the
end
of
the
analysis.
why
shouldn't
it
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
different?
why
is
it
a
different
question?
if
i
own
premises,
i
can
invite
in
a
friend.
i
can
invite
in
a
relative.
i
can
invite
in
a
complete
stranger
if
i
want
to
do
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
a
presumption?
it's
a
right,
is
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
that.
why
should
it
--
well,
all
right.
why
should
i
feel
myself
bound
by
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can
say
that
in
lots
of
consent
search
cases.
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
of
whether
the
person
has
validly
consented.
is
there
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
have
a
consent
search
where
there's
probable
cause
because
where
there's
probable
cause,
you
can
get
a
warrant
and,
therefore,
you
can't
consent
to
the
search?
is
there
a
case
that
says
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
so
why
should
that
be
the
rule
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
a
woman
who
has
been
beaten
up.
she's
got
bruises.
she's
standing
on
the
doorstep
of
her
house.
and
she
says
to
the
police:
i'd
like
you
to
come
into
the
house
and
see
evidence
of
what
my
husband
has
been
doing
to
me.
and
you
say
she
can't
do
that.
she
has
--
it's
her
house,
but
she
can't
invite
the
police
in?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
jardines
was
based
on
an
understanding
of
property
rights,
wasn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
was
based
on
an
understanding
of
property
rights,
jardines?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
your
rule
express
profound
disrespect
for
the
--
the
cotenant
who
was
standing
at
the
door
and
who
has
--
who
says,
i've
just
been
beaten
up
by
my
cotenant
and
i
want
you
to
come
into
my
house
and
see
the
evidence
of
what
my
cotenant
has
done
to
me.
and
you
say
to
that
cotenant
who's
standing
by
the
door
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
invite
the
police
into
your
house
to
look
for
evidence
of
what
was
done
to
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
but
it
would
apply
in
that
case,
would
it
not?
