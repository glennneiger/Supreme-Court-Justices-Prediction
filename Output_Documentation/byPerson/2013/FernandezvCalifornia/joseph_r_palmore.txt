mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
individual's
consent
to
admit
visitors
into
her
own
home
may
not
be
prospectively
negated
by
the
earlier
objection
of
an
absent
tenant.
each
co-occupant
assumes
the
risk
that
the
other
will
admit
visitors
not
to
his
liking
and
this
court
has
adopted
a
mirroring
rule
of
fourth
amendment
consent.
we
read
georgia
versus
randolph
as
establishing
a
narrow
exception
to
that
rule
in
a
situation
in
which
the
two
co-occupants
are
standing
in
the
doorway
disputing
and
disagreeing
on
whether
to
admit
the
visitors.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
justice
ginsburg,
randolph
was
a
self-consciously,
narrowly
written
and
explained
decision.
on
its
own
terms
it
is
--
it
is
narrow.
and
we
read
it
as
--
as
establishing
a
narrow,
circumstance-specific
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
this
area.
the
general
rule
in
this
area
is
articulated
by
the
court
in
matlock.
and
it's
the
assumption
of
risk
idea,
that
when
you
live
with
another
you
assume
the
risk
that
they
will
admit
visitors
not
to
your
liking.
and
randolph
puts
a
gloss
on
that
rule
which
says
when
you
live
with
another,
you
put
--
you
assume
the
risk
of
your
inability
to
control
access
to
the
premises
when
you
are
not
there.
when
you
are
there,
the
two
occupants
are
standing
in
the
doorway
disagreeing
on
whether
to
admit
the
visitor,
what
randolph
said
was
the
tie
goes
to
the
objector.
when
the
objector
is
absent,
there
is
no
tie,
and
the
normal
rule
applies.
the
normal
rule
is
that
each
occupant
has
the
authority
in
her
own
right
to
admit
visitors
to
her
own
home.
mr.
fisher's
presentation
began
with
his
articulation
of
a
view
that
the
--
that
this
area
of
co-occupant
consent
is
based
on
agency
principles,
that
the
reason
in
a
matlock
situation
that
we
allow
the
present
tenant
to
consent
and
we
didn't
ask
the
--
the
potentially
objecting
defendant
who
was
sitting
in
the
squad
car
at
the
curb
is
because
we
all
--
we
can
assume
that
she
speaks
for
him.
but
that's
not
what
matlock
said.
matlock
said
she
has
the
authority
to
give
consent
in
her
own
right.
she
lives
there
too,
and
she
can
decide
whom
to
admit
to
her
home.
justice
kennedy,
you
highlighted
the
issue
that
under
petitioner's
view
there
is
in
a
sense
a
continuing
objection
and
it's
entirely
unclear
when
it
ends.
and
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
in
custody.
he
was
arrested
on
probable
cause.
and
he
was
in
custody
through
the
duration,
through
the
--
through
the
trial.
and
it
--
we
--
the
standard
on
the
other
side
is
completely
unmanageable,
because
unless
the
consent
is
going
to
be
viewed
as
perpetual,
that
it
kind
of
hovers
like
a
phantom
above
the
doorstep--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--excuse
me?
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
justice
sotomayor,
in
this
case--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
he
had
been
identified
as
--
as
the
robber,
so
you
will
recall
the
facts.
there
was
a
robbery.
they
go
--
in
fact,
i
think
mr.
karlin
was
correct
that
there
was
really
kind
of
exemplary
police
work
at
every
step
in
this
case.
these
officers
were
in
the
gang
intelligence
unit.
they
went
to
this
alleyway
because
knew
that
that
was
a
likely
place
a
gang
member
would
go--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
there
are
two
--
the
sequence
is
important.
they
are
--
they're
in
the
alley
because
they
think
there
may
be
a
connection
to
the
robbery.
then
they
hear
screaming
from
the
apartment
and
fighting.
then
they
think
they
have
a
domestic
violence
situation,
which
they
do.
they
go
to
the
door.
she
answers
the
door,
bloodied
and
bruised.
they
take
him
out
to
separate
the
two
and
to
figure
out
what's
going
on
in
the
domestic
violence
situation.
as
they
are
taking
him
out,
they
recognize
the
tattoo,
that
he
matches
the
description
of
the
robbery
suspect
and
then
there's
a
show
of
identification.
at
that
point,
it
becomes
both
a
robbery
investigation
and
a
domestic
violence
investigation.
and
he's
put
under
arrest.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
pardon
me?
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
they
almost
certainly
did
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
at
that
--
at
that
point.
but
the
chief
justice
is
quite
correct
that
in
kentucky
v.
king
this
court
made
clear
that
the
possibility
that
the
police
could
have
pursued
an
alternative
means
of
obtaining
the
evidence--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes,
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
your
honor,
i
don't
think
a
reasonable
time
requirement
like
that
is
readily
administrable.
it
doesn't
provide
a
clear
answer
to
officers
in
the
field
on
what
their
rights
are
to--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--your
honor,
that's
just
inconsistent
with
kentucky
v.
king
and--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--justice
sotomayor,
this
court
has
not
adopted
that
kind
of
less
restrictive
means
analysis
in
that
area.
and
again
kentucky
v.
king
is
--
is
clear
on
this
point,
that
the
reasonableness
of
police
actions
has
to
be
judged
based
on
those
actions
themselves.
and
if
they
are
reasonable
on
their
face,
they're
not
rendered
unreasonable
because
the
officers
could
have
obtained
a
warrant
or
could
have
obtained
the
evidence
in
some
other
way.
and
in
a
case
like
this
--
and
it's
also
important
to
note
that
consent
is
not
a
disfavored
doctrine
that
--
that
needs
to
be
confined
to
narrow
categories.
this
court
has
said,
going
back
to
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte,
that
consent
is
actually
favored,
that
we
want
people
to
cooperate
with
law
enforcement.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
your
honor,
that
was
of
course
dicta
in
randolph
because
there
was
no
--
that
wasn't
presented,
and
it
isn't
presented
here
either
because
there's
no
such
allegation.
we
actually
agree,
i
think
perhaps
all
of
us
at
these
tables
agree,
that
--
that
to
the
extent
there
is
an
inquiry
like
that
it
has
to
be
an
objective
inquiry.
so
we
read
that
as
alluding
to
a
possibility
that
if
the
--
if
the
officers
arrested
someone
without
probable
cause
or
took
some
other
step
that
was
objectively
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
that
might
raise
an
issue.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
don't
think
that
language
would
apply.
we
think
that
language
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
entire
corpus
of
this
court's
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence,
which
has
consistently
rejected
such
subjective
tests
and
looked
only
to
the
objective
reasonableness
of
officers'
actions.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
haven't
found
any
such
case.
i
did
look
and
there
--
there
are
plenty
of
defendants
that
make
that
argument.
i
haven't
found
one
where
it
--
where
it
succeeded.
and
often,
the
courts,
as
part
of
their
analysis
say,
no,
the
removal
wasn't
done
for
that
purpose.
it
was
done
because
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
you
committed
a
crime.
so
they
fall
back
on
the
normal
rule,
which
is
the
objective
test
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
actions.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
may
i
answer,
please?
you're
right,
justice
kennedy.
i
don't
think
the
property
law
is
--
crisply
presents
this
kind
of
disputed
consent
issue,
though
it
is
clear
under
property
law
that
cotenants
have
full
access
to
the
property
and
they
may
license
entry
to
the
same
extent
that
they
have
access
and
that
the
visitor
steps
into
their
shoes
and
it
would
not
be
liable
for
trespass.
