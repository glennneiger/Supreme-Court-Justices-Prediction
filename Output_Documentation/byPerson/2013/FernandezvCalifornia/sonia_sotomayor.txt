justice

finish.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
randolph
about
pretext?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
does
it
help
you
in
any
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sure.
because
all
they
have
to
do
is
arrest
and
remove
people.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
left
of
randolph
if
we
accept
your
--
all
the
police
have
to
do
is
arrest
anyone
if
they
have
probable
cause,
and
if
they
don't,
all
they
have
to
do
is
remove
them
from
the
premises
and
just
talk
to
the
co-tenant
even
though
they've
heard
an
objection?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
is
randolph
ever
going
to
survive
after
this,
assuming
we
accept
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there's
nothing
left
to
randolph.
the
police
just
remove
the
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
remove
them
to
the
stoop,
into
the
police
car,
to
the
station?
how
far
before
randolph
dies?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
matlock
--
there
was
no
objecting
defendant.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
the
presumption
that
still
survived,
that
absent
an
objection
you
have
a
consent,
you
assume
whoever
has
control
over
the
premises
has
consented.
that's
a
different
situation.
that's
not
matlock.
matlock
doesn't
control
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
i
thought
that
when
the
cotenants
gave
permission
to
search,
that
gave
permission
to
open
anything
in
the
premises,
to
search
the
entire
premises.
you're
talking
about
a
locked
closet
or
a
locked
box.
why
would
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
own
the
house.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
letting
the
person
use
it
by
sufferance,
not
by
--
but
it's
still
my
closet.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
would
certainly
recommend
to
every
married
couple
now
to
have
a
prenuptial
agreement
on
access
rights.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
did
they
need
to
search?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
did
they
need
to
search?
i
mean,
to
look
around
the
house,
yes,
but
if
this
is
a
search
only
for
purposes
of
domestic
violence
what
in
her
story
made
them
think
there
was
evidence
anywhere
that
was
locked
up
that
had
--
that
there
had
been
any
time
to
lock
it
up
or
dispose
of
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
this
was
just
a
pure:
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
find
something
else.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
were
looking
for
evidence
not
on
the
ground
that
they
arrested
him
on,
but
on
an
independent
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
they
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
once
he
was
identified,
did
they
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
a
clear
answer?
get
a
warrant.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
get
a
--
when
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
has
been
committed,
and
here
clearly
you
admit
there
would
have
been
probable
cause
to
search,
there's
no
exigency,
there's
no
looking
for
evidence
related
to
the
crime
that
drew
you
particularly
there,
the
screaming,
but
you've
just
got
to
secure
the
premises
and
get
a
warrant.
i
don't
know
why
that's
so
difficult
for
police
officers
to
understand.
your
first
obligation
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
get
a
warrant.
