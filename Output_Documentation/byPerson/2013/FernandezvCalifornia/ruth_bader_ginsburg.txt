mr.
fisher,
and
you
can
stick
with
this
case.
once
he's
arrested
on
a
robbery
charge,
he
can
be
held
for
many,
many
days.
why
isn't
it
appropriate
to
assume,
not
when
he's
asked
to
come
out
and
talk
to
the
police
for
two
minutes,
but
when
he's
incarcerated
on
a
robbery
charge,
that
the
premises
are
no
longer
open
to
him,
that
he's
no
longer
at
home
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
in
the
--
in
the
interim.
he's
been
charged,
not
convicted,
and
he's
--
he's
in
jail
awaiting
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
any
indication
why
the
police
didn't
get
a
warrant
in
that
hour
interval?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
be
so
if
fernandez
left
--
he's
made
known
his
objection
and
then
he
says
i'm
going
to
pick
up
something
at
the
drugstore.
the
minute
he
leaves,
can
the
police
then
say
to
his
cohabitant,
do
you
consent?
she
says,
yes.
police
come
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
could
reduce
randolph
to
nothingness
by
saying
the
police
--
as
long
as
the
police
act
lawfully
to
get
the
objector
out,
then
they
can
override,
that
his
objection
doesn't
count.
